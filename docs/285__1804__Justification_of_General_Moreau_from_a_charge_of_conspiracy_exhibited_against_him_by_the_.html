<p>PREFACE.
</p>
<p>Among the many persecutions of innocence which have arisen
</p>
<p>from, and attended the progress of, the French Revolution, froni
</p>
<p>the murder of the royal family to the present day, there has not one
</p>
<p>occurred which has excited such general sympathy as that of the
</p>
<p>celebrated, the brave, and the patriotick general Moreau. During
</p>
<p>a period of time, and in a nation, which seemed to regard a total
</p>
<p>renunciation of all the milder characteristicks of humanity as the
</p>
<p>nearest approach to perfectibility ; in which men appeared to con-
</p>
<p>tend for pre-eminence in barbarity ; in which the honours of the
</p>
<p>legislator, the magistrate, and the soldier, were crimsoned with
</p>
<p>the blood flowing from the harmless victims of fanaticism or rapa-
</p>
<p>city ; in which all sought for power only to excel their predecessors
</p>
<p>in the abuse of it ; Moreau, like a comet, pursued the eccentrick
</p>
<p>march of probity, honour, and virtue. The career of his life has
</p>
<p>not been rendered more glorious by the splendour of his military
</p>
<p>achievements, than singularby the generosity of his nature, and the
</p>
<p>disinterestedness of his publick services.
</p>
<p>That such a man, v/ho, in every station, seemed to hold himself
</p>
<p>in estimation only in proportion to the good he could render to his
</p>
<p>country, should, after a series of the most brilliant services, be-
</p>
<p>come the object of a prosecution on a charge of treason, at first
</p>
<p>excited the wonder, and has ended in fixing the indignation, of the
</p>
<p>world.
</p>
<p>The events which have recently taken place in France, have, to
</p>
<p>every person of the least discernment, fully explained the motive of
</p>
<p>this no less extraordinary than unjust proceeding : the whole detail
</p>
<p>of which has only served to establish the innocence of the accused ;
</p>
<p>and the criminality of his accuser.
</p>
<p>Moreau was a real republican ; he had fought to establish the
</p>
<p>liberties of France, on a rational and secure basis. He had
</p>
<p>seen and mourned the ravages which the struggles of successive
</p>
<p>parties had occasioned in his distracted country. He knew that
</p>
<p>the sources of those disorders were in the imbecility of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment ; and the only part he ever took in civil affairs was when he
</p>

</p>
<p>endeavoured to remedy this radical evil. It was with the hope of
</p>
<p>effecting a good so desirable, that he voluntarily assisted, on the
</p>
<p>18th Brumaire, to place Buonaparte in that situation which he no-
</p>
<p>bly rejected when offered to himself. Pleased with his work, he
</p>
<p>iv PREFACE.
</p>
<p>lent it his cordial support, and at the head of the chief army of the
</p>
<p>nation, was, in a great degree, the insttument that accomplished
</p>
<p>its lirm establishment.
</p>
<p>So long as Buonaparte was contented with the power thus con-
</p>
<p>ferred upon him, and rendered legitimate by its necessity, so long-
</p>
<p>did he cultivate a good understanding with Moreau, consider him
</p>
<p>as his best friend, and invest him with the only authority of which
</p>
<p>he would accept. But the moment other projects of ambition en-
</p>
<p>tered his mind, conscious of their unworthiness, and that they
</p>
<p>never could receive the sanction of the general, he began to vrev/
</p>
<p>him with jealousy, to listen to and encourage every rumour to his
</p>
<p>prejudice, and finally withdrew from him entirely. Under these
</p>
<p>auspices, and taking advantage of a moment of popular enthusiasm,
</p>
<p>the change in the duration of the consulate was effected, and
</p>
<p>Buonaparte was declared consul for life, with the right of naming
</p>
<p>his successor, and with other privileges and powers never contem-
</p>
<p>plate^d in his original appointment. Still Moreau, however he
</p>
<p>might disapprove of the measure, made no opposition ; from which
</p>
<p>he must have been deterred by his love of retirement, by consi-
</p>
<p>dering the change as not of importance enough to authorise his
</p>
<p>interference, or, what is not improbable, from a consideration that
</p>
<p>the power of the consul v/as now so confirmed, that to oppose it,
</p>
<p>Vv^ould only be to expose his own life, without the chance of pre~
</p>
<p>venting the encroachment upon the liberty he loved.
</p>
<p>One degree of power successfully acquired in opposition to law,
</p>
<p>and in contempt of the rights of others, but stimulates to further
</p>
<p>attempts of the same nature. It is not therefore surprising that,
</p>
<p>possessing so much, Buonaparte should desire still more. There
</p>
<p>is but one limit to ambition ; that is when it has nothing more to
</p>
<p>acquire. Fortunate in accomplishing his purposes, beyond what
</p>
<p>could at any time have been his expectations ; possessing a power
</p>
<p>every way incompatible with the principles upon which the French
</p>
<p>revolution had been predicated, and directly contradicting all his
</p>
<p>own professions ; but one step removed from the highest authori-

<p>t}'^ acknowledged ; yet the ambition of Buonaparte could not be
</p>
<p>satiated until that authority should be attained.
</p>
<p>It was an attempt full of hazard ; but the danger that threatened
</p>
<p>it could only proceed from- virtue. The many declarations of the
</p>
<p>French against royalty, under any form, stared him in the face in
</p>
<p>ten thousand shapes ; but these were only words and could easily
</p>
<p>be erased. That veteran army which had so repeatedly, on the
</p>
<p>field of battle, sworn eternal hatred to monarchy, still existed.
</p>
<p>The general who had so often conducted that army to victory, and
</p>
<p>saved it from destruction, still lived ,^ lived in the hearts of the
</p>
<p>soldiers ; surrounded by all the splendour of his former actions,
</p>
<p>untarnished by even one ambitious thought, or a single action
</p>
<p>PREFACE. V
</p>
<p>unworthy of the patriot. He had, it v/as imagined, relunctantly,
</p>
<p>submitted to former usurpations ; the present would perhaps ex-
</p>
<p>haust his patience, and rouse all his civick virtues. His name was
</p>
<p>terrible to the consul ; it was adored by the army and people.
</p>
<p>Moreau, must, therefore, either be gained over, or deprived of
</p>
<p>the power of opposition.
</p>
<p>The latter course only remained. He was not to be corrupted,
</p>
<p>but he was mortal. Even in this country we are not ignorant of
</p>
<p>what malice and defamation will attempt against the purest repu-
</p>
<p>tation, when urged by ambition. For a considerable time the
</p>
<p>ministerial prints in France were in the habit of uttering hints and
</p>
<p>suspicisns concerning Moreau, till at last the publick mind becama
</p>
<p>prepared for something ; and, the other schemes being matured,
</p>
<p>those inuendos changed their shape, and assumed the positive cha-
</p>
<p>racter of accusations. The friend of his country was arrested ;
</p>
<p>the Senatus-Consultum was promulgated ; Buonaparte was declar-
</p>
<p>ed Emperour ; and Moreau was arraigned as a criminal.
</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark that general Moreau was not brought to
</p>
<p>trial until the usurpation had been completed, and Buonaparte had
</p>
<p>been fixed on the pinnacle to which his guilty wishes had long
</p>
<p>pointed. It is not less worthy of notice, that, during the time the
</p>
<p>change of government was in agitation, so much vv^as his influence
</p>
<p>dreaded that all communication with him v/as denied, lest his
</p>
<p>opinions might, by some means or other, get abroad. That, in
</p>
<p>the mean time, every method which ingenuity could devise, was
</p>
<p>employed to blacken his reputation, particularly with the army,
</p>
<p>vfhere those very officers who had so often been led to conquest, and
</p>
<p>preserved from ruin, by the resources of his genius, scrupled not
</p>
<p>with base ingratitude, and the more base because coupled with in-
</p>
<p>justice, to pronounce him guilty of the highest crime recognized
</p>
<p>by the laws of any country. It was necessary by such acts to per-
</p>
<p>suade the army that he was unworthy of its confidence, before he
</p>
<p>could be deprived of it. They succeeded for the moment ; but
</p>
<p>the delusion either is, or must soon be, dissipated.

<p>In the elevation of Buonaparte will be found the only source of
</p>
<p>Moreau's prosecution : in the conscience of Buonaparte will be
</p>
<p>read the only evidence of his guilt. That secret power told him
</p>
<p>that all good men must condemn his conduct ; and as one of those
</p>
<p>Moreau v^as well known to him. The issue of this trial certainly
</p>
<p>does not justify the slanders uttered against this general. Had any
</p>
<p>pretext been found he would have shared the fate of Georges.
</p>
<p>His innocence v/as manifest ; but the danger of his being at liberty |
</p>
<p>had not passed over, and though they dare not proceed so far as to
</p>
<p>inflict publick death, he was in confinement, and it was very easy
</p>
<p>to decree that he should remain there.
</p>
<p>This decree, hov/ever, we are told, has been reversed, and
</p>
<p>vi PREFACE.
</p>
<p>the general has been allowed to seek an asylum in this land of li-
</p>
<p>berty, and of peace, which extends its arms to receive and protect
</p>
<p>the persecuted of every country. That the mild and benevolent
</p>
<p>genius of our laws can afford security and the prospect of tranquillity
</p>
<p>and happiness to this general, perhaps the only one who passed
</p>
<p>through the French revolution untainted by crimes ; whose only
</p>
<p>view was his country's liberty and happiness ; ought to be a sub-
</p>
<p>ject of exultation and happiness to their citizens. That he comes
</p>
<p>here innocent of the only charges that have ever attempted to cloud
</p>
<p>his honour, is, and ought to be, rejoiced in.
</p>
<p>That he is innocent will be fully proven to all who attentively
</p>
<p>examine the following document, which was first delivered to the
</p>
<p>American reader through the medium of the Norfolk Gazette and
</p>
<p>Publick Ledger ; and now appears in its present form, not from
</p>
<p>any hope of emolument, none is expected, but to render it more
</p>
<p>permanent and easy of reference. The original is an unadorned
</p>
<p>argument ; the translation aims only at fidelity and perspicuity.
</p>
<p>Hoping that the general might be fortunate enough to arrive in the
</p>
<p>United States, the object of the translator was, and is, by publish-
</p>
<p>ing this memoir, to shew his innocence to those among whom he
</p>
<p>may be destined to pass the remainder of an unsullied life : and to
</p>
<p>present in the injustice of his persecution, a new mirrour, in which
</p>
<p>to contemplate the character of that man who is now the bugbear of
</p>
<p>the world ; and to gratify whose criminal ambition even a Moreau

<p>must be sacrificed.
</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION OF MOREAU.
</p>
<p>ON the first knowledge of the arrest of General Moreau, and of
</p>
<p>the motives of that arrest, every mind was struck with profound
</p>
<p>consternation.
</p>
<p>They had cause for being so. He was either guilty, or he was
</p>
<p>innocent.
</p>
<p>Was he guilty ? What! Moreau I the modest soldier, who never
</p>
<p>aspired but at the head of armies, never seemed fotward but in the
</p>
<p>field of battle ; in all other situations distinguished from his
</p>
<p>fellow-citizens only by the simplicity of his manners ! Moreau I
</p>
<p>who had never been thought to possess a wish for personal eleva-
</p>
<p>tion ! whose mind never harboured the idea that his successes
</p>
<p>could open for him a road to power ; not even at those epochs
</p>
<p>when France, harrassed by the oscillations of weak governments,
</p>
<p>would have regarded his ambition as its greatest blessing ! This
</p>
<p>man, who, in the midst of his victories, was heard only to utter
</p>
<p>one wish, that, by speedily securing the independence of his coun-
</p>
<p>try, he might be restored to that privicy, whose delights, with
</p>
<p>those of glory, divided his heart, and were his only passions 1
</p>
<p>What 1 could that man so remarked for his moderation, who was
</p>
<p>a hero even amongst heroes, could he descend to become a traitor
</p>
<p>to that cause, and a conspirer against that government, which he
</p>
<p>had so long supported, so often defended ? The most brilliant and
</p>
<p>best established virtue is then become no more than a long and
</p>
<p>dastardly hypocrisy, if Moreau can be perfidious.
</p>
<p>Was he innocent ? V/hat then must we think of that govern-
</p>
<p>ment, till then so worthy of our confidence and love, which,
</p>
<p>departing at once from the respect it professed for individual liber-
</p>
<p>ty, threw ignominious chains upon one of its greatest warriours :
</p>
<p>recompensed by criminal accusations, a general, rendered sacred
</p>
<p>by the many eminent services which he has performed, by the many
</p>
<p>victories which he has gained, by the many civick crowns due to
</p>
<p>him for the preservation of entire armies, and for the vast territo-
</p>
<p>ries which he has annexed to the French Empire. What guarantee
</p>
<p>will vulgar citizens have against oppression, if one of the most

</p>
<p>illustrious but we stop. Such an idea would be
</p>
<p>too alarmino-.-  We must endeavour to repel it  but, with ij,
</p>
<p>[2]
</p>
<p>let us also banish the afflicting idea, that general Moreau could
</p>
<p>ever stain his laurels !
</p>
<p>Moreau has not betrayed his glory  He is innocent.
</p>
<p>Nor has the government belied its justice  there was cause of
</p>
<p>alarm.
</p>
<p>Pvloreau, in his prison, will be found the same as in the midst
</p>
<p>of armies, the true friend of his country ; seeing only her, and
</p>
<p>always incapable of sacrificing his respect for the pubiick order, to
</p>
<p>any regard for his personal safety.
</p>
<p>Just towards himself, he has not neglected his own defence.
</p>
<p>Just towards the government that prosecuted him, he has openly
</p>
<p>acknowledged, that the measures of which he had become the
</p>
<p>object, were occasioned by suspicions that required to be immedi-
</p>
<p>ately destroyed.
</p>
<p>They either are, or ought to be, already dissipated. The circum-
</p>
<p>stances connected with this case, are now to be given, with sim-
</p>
<p>plicity, to the pubiick. We demand no indulgence for him j we
</p>
<p>ask for ourselves, only that attention which we can lay claim to
</p>
<p>by so many titles.
</p>
<p>For four months general Moreau has been denounced, by the
</p>
<p>pubiick reports of the Grand-Judge, by placards printed and affixed
</p>
<p>to pubiick places, by the orders of generals to their armies, and
</p>
<p>by addresses from all the constituted authorities, and from a great
</p>
<p>number of military corps.
</p>
<p>Doubtless all these productions of zeal, though perhaps a little
</p>
<p>irregular, attest a great and laudable attachment to the government.
</p>
<p>But they do not prove, and cannot be admitted to prove, any thing
</p>
<p>more. Above all they prove nothing against the accused. A per-
</p>
<p>son accused is not to be judged by generals : their condition
</p>
<p>itself declares against the idea that they are to direct criminal pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings. He is not to be judged by the ministers, nor by the
</p>
<p>placards, of the government ; there would then no longer be an
</p>
<p>independent judiciary. Nor is he to be judged by addresses ; vain
</p>
<p>echoes of parole charges of guiit, and whose signers, by their

</p>
<p>distance from the scene, and by their absolute defect of the quality
</p>
<p>of judging, are incapable of investigating the circumstances, or of
</p>
<p>examining the evidence, of the fact : these addresses evince the
</p>
<p>natural horrour which their authors, in common with others, have
</p>
<p>conceived for all crimes similar to that alleged ; but they do not
</p>
<p>announce, on the individual facts, a conviction, to form which all
</p>
<p>the necessary elements are wanting.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these orders, these placards, these reports, these
</p>
<p>addresses, all e^iist. They are in every journal, on every wall,
</p>
<p>in every hand. During four months France has resounded with
</p>
<p>them. During four months every voice that was heard, was heard
</p>
<p>against Moreau j not one has been raised in his favour, excent a
</p>
<p>[3]
</p>
<p>solitary cry from his generous brother. But he, all this time in
</p>
<p>prison, held in the most rigorous seclusion, denied all communi-
</p>
<p>cation with others, even refused the pixsence of his own family,
</p>
<p>and without one defender, was compelled to be silent, while uni-
</p>
<p>versally accused. He was not permitted to dissipate prejudices ia
</p>
<p>their birth, and before they should take root in the publick mind.
</p>
<p>He was not allowed to trace the charges against him singly, step
</p>
<p>by step, and before they had assembled into a mass. He was not
</p>
<p>at liberty to contradict the falsehoods rumoured against him, before
</p>
<p>they could establish themselves in some credulous imaginations j
</p>
<p>to correct malignant and erroneous irjterpretations of his actions,
</p>
<p>which it is always more easy to publish than to retract ; to remove
</p>
<p>wrong impressions for which self-love often secretly contends
</p>
<p>against conviction ; to explain such parts of his conduct as might
</p>
<p>be supposed to afford some pretence for those rash judgments,
</p>
<p>which are with difficulty banished from the mind when once enter-
</p>
<p>tained by it. In a word, all have had the power of accusing
</p>
<p>Moreau ; none, until this day, has had the means of defending
</p>
<p>him. Such we know is the consequence of all criminal proceed-
</p>
<p>ings ; but that does not make the evil, as applicable to him, any
</p>
<p>thing less. For who can be ignorant of the ravages which this con-
</p>
<p>cert of censuring voices may make in any reputation ; particularly
</p>
<p>in these times of political tempests, when so many have deserted
</p>
<p>their professions and their duties that all virtues have, naturally,
</p>
<p>become objects of suspicion.
</p>
<p>It is, then, no more than justice to hear, with a peculiar atten-
</p>
<p>tion, the defence of general Moreau. He asks to be heard, not
</p>
<p>only in the name of his services, but in the name of his innocence.
</p>
<p>He asks it under the influence of a consideration of importance to
</p>
<p>society, no less than the interests of each of its members. The
</p>
<p>example of general Moreau proves, but too well, one great truth :
</p>
<p>that among those whom Providence has condemned to live in an
</p>
<p>heroick, a brilliant, but a terrible age, when the human species, as
</p>
<p>if fatigued by repose, delivers itself at once' to universal disorder ;

<p>when the face of the earth is totally changed ; when society is sud-
</p>
<p>denly reversed ; v/hen empires are in a manner confounded ; when
</p>
<p>new thrones are erected as easily as old ones are overthrown ;
</p>
<p>when those who were yesterday surrounded by splendour, to-day
</p>
<p>languish in obscurity and wretchedness ; when, by the caprice of
</p>
<p>fortune, the most brilliant destinies, in the glance of an eye, be-
</p>
<p>come so forlorn and miserable as to be objects of compassion even
</p>
<p>to the most mortal enemy ; that in such times, there is no man
</p>
<p>can one day assure himself that on the next he may not appear on
</p>
<p>the list of accused, and be arraigned as a traitor.
</p>
<p>Let each, then, turn his contemplation upon himself ; let him
</p>
<p>banish, by a just exertion of egotism, every prejudice which might
</p>
<p>B
</p>
<p>[4]
</p>
<p>have arisen in his mind during the forced silence of the accused ;
</p>
<p>let him forget every thing which has deviated from the true path
</p>
<p>of justice ; or rather let him remember all, that he may be provid-
</p>
<p>ed with strength to combat the impressions which might have been
</p>
<p>created by such irregular means. Let him come to the defence
</p>
<p>unprejudiced by the accusation ; and let him consider it with that
</p>
<p>respect for presumptive innocence, with that holy impartiality,
</p>
<p>which, one day or other, after having performed it as a duty to his
</p>
<p>fellow-citizen, he may be happy to find extended to himself.
</p>
<p>Time is not afforded to the advocates of general Moreau, to
</p>
<p>retrace, in this justificatory memoir, all the circumstances of his
</p>
<p>publick life. They are known to all France, and to Europe.
</p>
<p>They must content themselves with merely recalling to view such
</p>
<p>particulars as may affect the accusation of which he is the object.
</p>
<p>Arrived, by regular advances, to the rank of General of Brigade,
</p>
<p>Bf oreau served in that capacity in the army of the north. He had
</p>
<p>under him a division of twenty-five thousand men, when, in' the
</p>
<p>second year, Pichegru took the chief command. This was the first
</p>
<p>of their personal intercourse. He was not, therefore, as has been
</p>
<p>asserted in several pamphlets, a pupil of that general. But it is true
</p>
<p>that he had conceived for the talents of Pichegru, then one of the
</p>
<p>best generals in Europe, as much respect, as, in his subsequent
</p>
<p>relations with him, he entertained attachment for his person*^
</p>
<p>Their connexion, however, was not of long continuance. Piche-
</p>
<p>gru had only commanded eight months, when, in the third year,
</p>
<p>he passed to the army of the Rhine, and Moreau succeeded hini
</p>
<p>in that of the north.
</p>
<p>Peace with Prussia gave him a few months repose in Holland,
</p>
<p>In the fourth year, Pichegru was recalled by the Directory ; and
</p>
<p>Moreau, became general, of the army of the Rhine. He took the
</p>
<p>command on the first of Messidor ; on the 6th he passed the Rhine*
</p>
<p>'No one in France can forget, that, under the conduct of its new
</p>
<p>general, the march of this army was from victory to victory .^
</p>
<p>The world will long remember the battles of Renchen and

</p>
<p>Friedberg, which made Moreau master of Suabia, Bavaria,^
</p>
<p>and the circles of Upper Rhine ; and the defeat of the army of the
</p>
<p>Sambre and Meuse, which left him one hundred leagues from the
</p>
<p>frontiers of France, in the centre of Germany, and surrounded by
</p>
<p>tv/o armies of his enemies  only to increase his glory. All Eu-
</p>
<p>rope looked upon him as lost; and France already deplored the
</p>
<p>destruction of an army so distinguished for bravery, and of an
</p>
<p>ofncer whom this campaign had placed amongst the greatest gene-
</p>
<p>rals. But it was Moreau who commanded Frenchmen. He
</p>
<p>accomplished that skilful retreat, which procured him more grate-
</p>
<p>ful rewards than fame could confer, as from it he derived the hap-
</p>
<p>piness of having preserved so many soldiers, heroes, Frenchmen^
</p>
<p>[5]
</p>
<p>After having defeated in many battles, but particularly in the me-
</p>
<p>morable battle of Biberach, the armies which pursued him, he
</p>
<p>repassed the Rhine at Hunninguen and Brisach, during the first
</p>
<p>days of the fifth year, over the bodies of those who had vainly
</p>
<p>imagined that they could forever prevent his return to France 5.
</p>
<p>bringing with him 7,000 prisoners, several standards, and upwards
</p>
<p>of forty pieces of the enemy's artillery ; and bringing with him,
</p>
<p>what was infinitely more precious, that army, undiminished, whose
</p>
<p>return from Germany none had been so sanguine as even to hope
</p>
<p>for.
</p>
<p>The campaign of the year 5, was not less brilliant, It opened by
</p>
<p>a second passage of the Rhine, effected by the French army at
</p>
<p>Diersheim, n the first of Floreal, with equal valour and success.
</p>
<p>The defeat of the enemy was complete. Four thousand men and
</p>
<p>one general made prisoners, several standards, twenty pieces of
</p>
<p>cannon, the military chests, the bureau of the staff-major; and the
</p>
<p>fortress of Kehl, taken the next day after an obstinate fight of forty
</p>
<p>hours, were the fruits of this memorable passage.
</p>
<p>There now remained no obstacle to the complete possession of
</p>
<p>Germany. But, in the mean time, the conqueror of Arcole and
</p>
<p>of Rivoli was better employed than in gaining victories. He made
</p>
<p>use of the terrour which his name and his arms had inspired to pre-
</p>
<p>pare peace for his country. The preliminaries of Leoben were
</p>
<p>signed ; and the army of the Rhine and Moselle was arrested in
</p>
<p>its career of conquest.
</p>
<p>Sometime after the passage of the Rhine the cabinet of General
</p>
<p>Kinglin fell into the hands of the French, It contained a great
</p>
<p>number of papers, and, amongst others, a voluminous correspon-
</p>
<p>dence in characters ; which were immediately carried to Moreau.
</p>
<p>Desaix was then indisposed. To him was committed the task of
</p>
<p>decyphering this correspondence. It w^s long and enigmatical ;
</p>
<p>much time was, consequently, necessary to comprehend it.  From
</p>
<p>it, however, was learnt, by Moreau and those emploj'ed to explain
</p>
<p>it, that Pichegru had, in the fourth year, maintained certain im-

</p>
<p>proper relations with the French princes.
</p>
<p>It was not possible to apprehend any thing from any project that
</p>
<p>might have occasioned this correspondence, as it referred entirely
</p>
<p>to the state in which the army of the Rhine was at the time it was
</p>
<p>projected, and to the movements it might malce under general
</p>
<p>Pichegru. For upwards of a year that general no longer com-
</p>
<p>manded this army, nor indeed any other. It is true he had become
</p>
<p>a member of the council of five hundred ; but in that capacity he
</p>
<p>possessed no power over any of those means upon which the de-
</p>
<p>sign disclosed in the correspondence with Kinglin seemed to de-
</p>
<p>pend. Besides Moreau had so effectually suppressed every spirit
</p>
<p>of dissaffection j had, by his loyalty, so overborne and discon-
</p>
<p>[6]
</p>
<p>certed every plan which might have been laid ; restored such a
</p>
<p>spirit to the army ; and infused such a terrour into the minds of the
</p>
<p>Germans, by the first passage of the Rhine, the battles of Renchen
</p>
<p>and Friedberg, the invasion of Bavaria one hundred leagues from
</p>
<p>the French frontier, the miraculous retreat in presence of the two
</p>
<p>armies of his enemy, and the battle of Biberach which was as a
</p>
<p>leave taking of the Austrians in the fourth year ; that a peace must
</p>
<p>necessarily have ensued the second passage of the Rhine in the
</p>
<p>year 5, even had not the good genius of Buonaparte already com-
</p>
<p>manded it in Italy.
</p>
<p>Such was the conduct of Moreau and his army.  That army upon
</p>
<p>which, one year before, some pragmatical politicians had built
</p>
<p>delusive expectations, the folly of which, was soon sufficiently de-
</p>
<p>monstrated. Perhaps a general who htd, by such glorious acts,
</p>
<p>destroyed those expectations, might be permitted to despise the
</p>
<p>projects upon which they were founded ; to revenge, by victories,
</p>
<p>the suspicions which they dared to entertain of the loyalty of his
</p>
<p>army ; and to content himself with having done so, without, use-
</p>
<p>lessly as affected the state, denouncing a comrade and friend, who
</p>
<p>perhaps had erred, but whose errour was no longer to be feared, as
</p>
<p>he had been effectually deprived of all the means from v/hich any
</p>
<p>injury could have proceeded.
</p>
<p>Moreau then did not at first write to the Directory concerning
</p>
<p>Fichegru. And will eA'^en acknowledge that he never would have
</p>
<p>done so, had circumstances left him master of his own conduct.
</p>
<p>But towards the end of the fifth year, the secret of the correspon-
</p>
<p>dence vv^ith Kinglin began to be spoken of.
</p>
<p>At the time when it was decyphered, it passed through several
</p>
<p>hands. General Moreau knew that it was publickly discussed.
</p>
<p>Two of his officers told him that he must resolve, either to give an
</p>
<p>account of it to the Directory, or be comprized in the denunciation
</p>
<p>which others were determined to present against both Pichegru
</p>
<p>and him, if he any longer persisted in his silence.
</p>
<p>Urged by necessity, he determined, on the I'Ah Fructidor, to

</p>
<p>write to the Director Barthelemy, and to reveal to him the secret
</p>
<p>of which the whole army was now in possession, and which must
</p>
<p>^n a few days be known to every one. He asked the advice of this
</p>
<p>director how he should act ; nor did he dissimulate the repugnance
</p>
<p>inspired by the part he was compelled to perform : " You know me
</p>
<p>sufficiently, said he to M. Barthelemy, to believe that this confi-
</p>
<p>dence costs me very dear."
</p>
<p>The act of accusation dates this letter the 19th Fructidor. An
</p>
<p>imperfect formation of the figure may have occasioned this errour.
</p>
<p>The truth is that it is dated the seventeenth ; but at any rate very
</p>
<p>little importance can be attached to the date.
</p>
<p>The act of accusation further says, that he did not write to Ear-
</p>
<p>[7]
</p>
<p>thelemy until he was informed, by the telegraphe, on the morn-
</p>
<p>ing of the 18th, of the steps taken by the Directory.
</p>
<p>This also is incorrect. But it is not the only errour which that in-
</p>
<p>strument exhibits. When an accusation is made against any one, it is
</p>
<p>the duty of the accuser, with religious accuracy to ascertain, in the
</p>
<p>first place, the truth of the charges. The truth in this instance is,
</p>
<p>that, in the fifth year, there had not been a telegraphe established
</p>
<p>on the Strasburg line. It was first erected in Brumaire, year 6.
</p>
<p>And a further proof that Moreau knew nothing of the events of the
</p>
<p>18th Fructidor, at the time he wrote, is, that he wrote to Barthe-
</p>
<p>lemj^, one of the proscribed.
</p>
<p>The letter was delivered to the Executive Directory. It plain-
</p>
<p>ly saw that this tardy disclosure was not spontaneous on the part
</p>
<p>of Moreau ; his commission was immediately revoked, and he
</p>
<p>returned to his private station.
</p>
<p>Such is the history of this denunciation, which has been so much
</p>
<p>insisted on, as constituting a justifiable source of inextinguishable
</p>
<p>hatred between Moreau and Pichegru. On the contrary, the
</p>
<p>smallest spark of justice on the part of the latter, must have con-
</p>
<p>vinced him of what he owed to the friendship that had so long de-
</p>
<p>layed a measure which was at last adopted only in compliance v/ith
</p>
<p>an irresistible necessity.
</p>
<p>Pichegru was sentenced to deportation. Escaped from, the hor-
</p>
<p>rours of Cayenne, he returned to Europe. Moreau maintained
</p>
<p>no relation with him, nor even heard him spoken of, until the
</p>
<p>year 10.
</p>
<p>The conduct of Moreau in this interval has been in open sight
</p>
<p>of all France. We have seen hira, in the year 7, at the instance
</p>
<p>of the Directory, which had recovered frona the erroneous impres-
</p>
<p>sions of the year 5, accept a subaltern rank in the army of Italy.
</p>
<p>We have seen that man, who is this day accused of ambition,
</p>
<p>serve under Scherer v/ithout even venturing the slightest objection.
</p>
<p> We have seen him, after the misfortunes of that general, assume,
</p>
<p>for a moment, the command of the army ; preserve it from total

<p>ruin ; collect its scattered fragments ; make head with twenty-five
</p>
<p>thousand against one hundred thousand men ; retire, step by step,
</p>
<p>and without check, by the Milanese and Piedmont ; throw garri-
</p>
<p>sons into all the strong places ; engage the Russians near Valentia ;
</p>
<p>render useless, by skilful dispositions, the immense superiority of
</p>
<p>his enemy ; and, in fine, concentrate his forces in the Genoese
</p>
<p>territory, there to wait the arrival of general Macdonald. We
</p>
<p>have seen him a short time after, united v/ith that general, by a
</p>
<p>victory over Bellegarde, inaugurate the plains of Marengo in those
</p>
<p>prodigies of valour and genius, with which another hero soon after
</p>
<p>astonished them and the woild. We have seen him, after having
</p>
<p>performed so many wonders, in the month of Thermidor, year 7,
</p>
<p>,[8]
</p>
<p>resign, without a murmur, the command of an army he had saved
</p>
<p>to general Joulaert, who, affected even to tears, by the order esta-
</p>
<p>blished by Moreau, and by the noble simplicity with which this
</p>
<p>unassuming soldier relinquished the chief rank, could not refrain
</p>
<p>from giving him the most publick marks of veneration and grati-
</p>
<p>tude. We have seen him at the request of his successor, without
</p>
<p>any command, but, as he himself used in a laughing manner to
</p>
<p>say, as an amateur, assist at the too celebrated and too unfortu-
</p>
<p>nate battle of Novi, v/here the brave but ill-fated Joubert was kil-
</p>
<p>led in the first charge. There we have seen him fighting in the
</p>
<p>ranks as a private soldier, while three horses were killed under
</p>
<p>him ; retarding by the effects of his valour a defeat which he had
</p>
<p>feretold ; in the moment of rout and disaster accepting the perilous
</p>
<p>honour of commanding a beaten army, assigned to him by the uni-
</p>
<p>versal acclamation of generals, officers, and soldiers ; restoring it
</p>
<p>to order, and presenting it with such a terrible aspect to its enem.ies
</p>
<p>that they durst not venture to pursue, as he re-conducted it in safe-
</p>
<p>ty to its strong positions in the territory of Genoa ; thus holding
</p>
<p>the key of Italy, and preparing victory for the general who was to
</p>
<p>succ;eed him. And v/e have seen him, finally, deliver this army,
</p>
<p>at the order of the Directory, to General Championnet. Thus have
</p>
<p>we beheld him, with the docility of an infant, assume and lay
</p>
<p>down, reassume and again resign, as necessity, or the caprice of
</p>
<p>those whom he always acknowledged as his magistrates, might
</p>
<p>dictate, the command of an army wholly devoted to him ; and
</p>
<p>which he might easily have retained, by the double power derived
</p>
<p>from his talents and the filial love of a grateful soldiery, v;^ho ac-
</p>
<p>knowledged him as their saviour and their father.
</p>
<p>Such was Moreau until the month of Vendimiaire, year 8. That
</p>
<p>same Moreau, whom this act of accusation compels to vindicate
</p>
<p>himself against a charge of conspiracy. Let us see how he has be-
</p>
<p>trayed the interests of his country.
</p>
<p>Early in the eighth year he returned to Paris. There he found
</p>
<p>one of the directors despairing of the government on account of its

</p>
<p>weakness ; a weakness so dependent on the vices of its nature, as
</p>
<p>to bafHe the most distinguished talents of any executive. This di-
</p>
<p>rector seemed convinced that every thing in France was lost, if a
</p>
<p>more energetick government were not devised j whose admiaistra-
</p>
<p>tion being less divided, should be better calculated for the aflfairs
</p>
<p>of a great and extensive empire.
</p>
<p>He expressed his sentiments to Moreau, and Moreau was con-
</p>
<p>vinced of their justice. But where v/as the man who at such a
</p>
<p>Juncture could grasp, with a hand sufficiently firm, the helm of af-
</p>
<p>fairs, and recover for France that ascendancy over Europe which
</p>
<p>she had lately possessed ? The visionary policy of the Directory
</p>
<p>had deprived France of her surest support, then, in a manner, ba-
</p>
<p>[9 ]
</p>
<p>nished to Egypt, whence it was scarcely possible the fleets of Eng-
</p>
<p>land would permit him to return. Moreau had only to speak one
</p>
<p>word, and his was the supreme power. He is not afraid to confess,
</p>
<p>that, had he believed himself capable of securing the pubiick good,
</p>
<p>he would not have hesitated to accept it. But on examining him-
</p>
<p>self, he did not perceive any indication that he was the person
</p>
<p>designed by heaven to fix the destinies of France.
</p>
<p>Far from his mind, even at this moment of unmerited humilia-
</p>
<p>tion, be every idea of false diffidence. Moreau is not guilty, in
</p>
<p>this acknowledgment, of injustice towards himself. He knows,
</p>
<p>and he may be permitted to avow it, wherein his own worth con-
</p>
<p>sists : he knows what station nature designed him in the political
</p>
<p>order ; his place will be found in the hour of danger and in the field
</p>
<p>of battle, whenever and wherever the chief of the nation shall deign
</p>
<p>to assign it to him. Every other situation appalled his courage.
</p>
<p>The weight of political affairs he never could endure. That total
</p>
<p>renunciation of domestick endearments ; that unremitting subjec-
</p>
<p>tion of the mind to pubiick concerns, which is the first and rigor-
</p>
<p>ous duty of those on whom devolve the chief magistracy ; that
</p>
<p>fatiguing attention to the cares of goverament, pressing from morn-
</p>
<p>ing 'till night and from night 'till morning, which cannot be evaded
</p>
<p>by those who accept the place to which they are attached ; that
</p>
<p>extent of judgment which must be possessed in order to regulate
</p>
<p>the concerns of a great nation ; that decision of character which is
</p>
<p>necessary, after the storms of a long revolution, to subjugate the
</p>
<p>various passions of various parties ; that rare discernment which
</p>
<p>is requisite in order to steer clear of those quicksands that are rea-
</p>
<p>dy to ingulph an unskilful pilot, and to know exactly how far to in-
</p>
<p>dulge, or where to oppose, popular opinion, to manage the passions
</p>
<p>so as to render male-contents or even enemies useful ; that genius,
</p>
<p>in one word, which comprehends every thing, regulates every
</p>
<p>thing, and foresees every thing ; which conceives the whole and
</p>
<p>distributes the details ; which at the same time is occupied with
</p>
<p>external dangers, and internal regulations, with men and with

<p>things, with the prosperity of the governed and the safety of the
</p>
<p>government; the assemblage of all these qualities, so requisite but
</p>
<p>which we had so long despaired of finding united, Moreau, without
</p>
<p>blushing, acknowledged could not be found in him. Led by an ir-
</p>
<p>resistible propensity to the happy walks of domestick life, he
</p>
<p>thought that, after having paid to his country the debt, which, as
</p>
<p>a citizen, he owed her, he might be allowed to indulge his private
</p>
<p>taste ; that he might at last return to the plough-share, after having
</p>
<p>so long managed the sword. Such enjoyments he looked to as the
</p>
<p>end and consummation of his labours. Judge then how far he was
</p>
<p>disposed to profit by the overtures of the director.
</p>
<p>The constant subjects of their private discussions, however, con=
</p>
<p>[ 10 1
</p>
<p>tinued to be the necessity of such a government, and the impossi-
</p>
<p>bility of then finding, in France, that person in whose hands it
</p>
<p>could be safely deposited, when they learnt that, by a miracle as
</p>
<p>incomprehensible as fortunate, Buonaparte had disembarked at
</p>
<p>Frejus. Moreau immediately hailed the omen ; let every thing
</p>
<p>be postponed, he cried, until Buonaparte arrives  'In him behold
</p>
<p>the destined saviour of France.
</p>
<p>The rest is known. Buonaparte arrives. The director disclo-
</p>
<p>ses the project to him. Moreau is consulted. The eighteenth
</p>
<p>Brumaire bursts upon us with all its splendour. Moreau dissolves
</p>
<p>the Directory. Buonaparte is proclaimed Consul.
</p>
<p>Moreau, by the appointment of the consul, took command of the
</p>
<p>army of the Rhine. He re-organized it ; and, on the 5th Floreal
</p>
<p>year 8, he crossed that river a third time at its head. On the 13th
</p>
<p>and 14th he defeated Kray at Engen, took from him seven thou-
</p>
<p>sand men, ninety pieces of cannon, and a large portion of his mili-
</p>
<p>tary stores. The 15th he gained the battle of Mosskirch. On
</p>
<p>the 19th he conquered a second sime at Biberach, on the same
</p>
<p>field which first felt his victorious tread three years before. He de-
</p>
<p>tached twenty -two thousand inen to the army of Italy, to assist,
</p>
<p>under the auspices of the greatest of the French generals, in decid-
</p>
<p>ing the fate of France and of Europe. He did not the less eager-
</p>
<p>ly pursue the path of victory. He passed the Danube ; subdued
</p>
<p>Augsburg ; expunged the stigma which French valour had for-
</p>
<p>merly received in the plains of Hochstet'^', by a victory which gave
</p>
<p>him five thousand prisoners, five stands of colours, twenty pieces
</p>
<p>of cannon, and immense stores. He continued his triumphant
</p>
<p>progress. Neuberg, Laudstrutt, bestov/ed new laurels on his
</p>
<p>soldiers. Munich opened her gates. The Orisons submitted.
</p>
<p>Croia v/as taken : and the army of the Rhine thus in a manner
</p>
<p>witnessed that almost supernatural victory, by which the brave ar-
</p>
<p>my of Italy, under that illustrious chief who has always sported
</p>
<p>with perils and with difficulties, re-established for ever the supre-
</p>
<p>macy of France, and gave peace to Europe. A truce was granted

<p>by this army, at the same time that Moreau, by an armistice, per-
</p>
<p>mitted the German empire to repose for a moment. That moment
</p>
<p>was soon at an end. Moreau was ordered to recommence hostili-

<p>miracles of Italy, and the immortal day of Marengo, will be for-

<p>ever hailed as the most brilliant example of French bravery ; the
</p>
<p>battle of Hohenlinden, which put into the hands of Moreau, ten

<p>and two hundred covered waggons.

</p>
<p>The frontiers of Austria are passed. Saltzburg receives a gar?
</p>
<p>rison. Vienna trembles at the vicinity of a republican army. An
</p>
<p>armistice is solicited. The conquerour dictates the terras. Peace
</p>
<p>is signed. And the destinies of France are finally determined.
</p>
<p>Moreau was once more restored to his family. The enemies of
</p>
<p>the publick happiness, whatever may have been their design, la-
</p>
<p>boured to give the chief magistrate the most false impressions of a
</p>
<p>man who most sincerely desired his prosperity. Their good un-
</p>
<p>derstanding was interrupted. Moreau made some strong efforts
</p>
<p>to restore it. These failing, he retired to domestick obscurity.
</p>
<p>He broke off all these connexions which had a tendency to disturb
</p>
<p>the tranquillity of the life he had adopted ; maintained no further
</p>
<p>relation with men in power ; and even avoided the society of many
</p>
<p>of his old companions in arms. He in some manner became
</p>
<p>estranged to all former habits and affections ; certainly not because
</p>
<p>he was insensible of their charm, but because he did not wish to
</p>
<p>furnish any weapon for calumny. A few friends, mostly men out
</p>
<p>of place and of retired dispositions, formed his circle. The
</p>
<p>amusements of a rural life, the chase, and social intercourse with
</p>
<p>his own family, occupied all his time. While devoted to them, he
</p>
<p>patiently awaited the arrival of a period when the present clouds
</p>
<p>should disappear ; when some happy occasion should enable him
</p>
<p>to convince the first consul, by his services should they be requir-
</p>
<p>ed, or by his devotedness were it necessary to give a new proof of
</p>
<p>it, that he never had ceased to honour his talents, and rejoice in
</p>
<p>his glory and success.
</p>
<p>This tranquil life was all at once disturbed, by an incident which
</p>
<p>awakened remembrances almost effaced from the mind.
</p>
<p>General Moreau had formerly been intimately acquainted with a
</p>
<p>curate of Pompadour, a man of talents, and uncle of general Sou*
</p>
<p>ham, named David. This David in 1793, during the persecution
</p>
<p>of the priests, took refuge in the staff-major of his nephew. Gene^^
</p>
<p>ral Moreau was then in the service of the Republick. But let us
</p>
<p>here bear testimony to a trait in his character which none can

<p>contradict. He always abhorred those persecutions, with whicl^
</p>
<p>many self-stiled republicans aflllicted the various classes of citizens :
</p>
<p>whoever was a Frenchman and a man of honour, possessed unfailing
</p>
<p>claims upon his protection, wherever it could be afforded. M. Da-
</p>
<p>vid was unhappy ; he was therefore welcome to the general. Da-
</p>
<p>vid, his nephew general Souham, and Moreau, lived together in
</p>
<p>the house of Pichegru : and afterwards, when those different per*.
</p>
<p>sons met each other, it was with that pleasure which is always fel$
</p>
<p>in the presence of those whom we have known in times of adversity.
</p>
<p>Moreau had heard no more of David from the time of Pi_hegru's
</p>
<p>deportation, until the middle of the year 10, when he one day den
</p>
<p>manded an interview with the general. Its object was to oDtain
</p>
<p>C
</p>
<p>[ 12]
</p>
<p>an explanation of what he called the denunciation of Pichegru,
</p>
<p>Moreau satisfied him ; satisfied him so entirely, that he became
</p>
<p>the mediator of a reconciliation between the two generals. A re-
</p>
<p>conciliation which ought not to occasion any surprise, after the
</p>
<p>detail which we have given of the facts that produced the innocent
</p>
<p>letter of the 17th Fructidor.
</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the nature of this reconciliation, the
</p>
<p>details of which constitute three charges in the act of accusation,
</p>
<p>amongst .which figures the crhne of being reconciled, it was with
</p>
<p>the greatest surprise that Moreau learnt, about the beginning of
</p>
<p>Pluviose last, from Lajolais, (a friend of Pichegru, whom he had
</p>
<p>som.e occasion to know the preceding summer) that Pichegru was
</p>
<p>then in Paris. Lajolais even virged an interview at different places
</p>
<p>which he named, where Pichegru wished to discuss his own parti-
</p>
<p>cular, affairs. But Moreau thinking his return to Paris, without
</p>
<p>the sanction of government, extremely imprudent, constantly re-
</p>
<p>fused to meet him.
</p>
<p>Pichegru, having resolved, a.t all risks, to see Moreau, came to
</p>
<p>his house about eight o'clock on the evening of the 11th Pluviose.
</p>
<p>It was a day most unhappily chosen by a man whose greatest desire
</p>
<p>must have been concealment, being the particular day of each
</p>
<p>week set apart, by the general, for receiving the visits of his
</p>
<p>friends.
</p>
<p>Moreau, after a few moments of unimportant conversation,
</p>
<p>pressed him to be gone.
</p>
<p>Some days afterwards he repeated his visit, equally unexpected^
</p>
<p>This was his last. Here terminated all personal communication
</p>
<p>between them ; and Pichegru was no more heard of by Moreau ;
</p>
<p>except it was, as is stated in the act of accusation, the next day by
</p>
<p>a certain Roland.
</p>
<p>' These visits, and the words supposed to have been then said,
</p>
<p>by Moreau to Pichegru, and by Pichegru to Moreau, of which, by
</p>
<p>the bye, no one was a witness, are the groundwork and the sub-
</p>
<p>jects of an accusation against an illustrious and hitherto untainted

<p>general.
</p>
<p>Pichegru, say they, long ago meditated the restoration of the
</p>
<p>Bourbons. He plotted in their favour in the year 4 : and hence
</p>
<p>Moreau, either by the intrigues of Pichegru, or by his tardiness
</p>
<p>in denouncing him, has become an object of just suspicions.
</p>
<p>Since that period, they continue to urge, by the intervention of
</p>
<p>David and Lajolais, Moreau has been fully reconciled with Piche-
</p>
<p>gru, and has even held communication with him ; circumstances
</p>
<p>which, from the antecedent conduct of Moreau, were totally in-
</p>
<p>compatible with the laws of honour ; they are therefore criminal,
</p>
<p>and could have no other view than to disturb the publick repose. "
</p>
<p>[ 13 ]
</p>
<p>In fact reports have circulated in London, that Moreau had pro-
</p>
<p>mised to re-establish the princes of the house of Bourbon.
</p>
<p>. That, in consequence of this promise, Pichegru and other Roy-
</p>
<p>alists had come to Paris ; had had interviews with Moreau, which,
</p>
<p>could not be otherwise than illicit and criminal ; that to him were
</p>
<p>made, on the part of the Bourbons, certain overtures, which he
</p>
<p>rejected it is true, but only by substituting others of his own pro-
</p>
<p>jecting, to wit, that he would place himself at the head of the
</p>
<p>Royal party, as soon as the first consul should be assassinated, on
</p>
<p>condition that they declared him dictator ; with full power to act
</p>
<p>according as his own inclination should impel him.
</p>
<p>In short, Moreau must, at all events, be guilty, although he
</p>
<p>did refuse to take any part in the conspiracy of Pichegru, in as much
</p>
<p>as he did not denounce it to the government : 
</p>
<p>1. Of the possibility of having formerly been the accomplice of
</p>
<p>Pichegru.
</p>
<p>2. Of being reconciled to, and maintaining a culpable correspon-
</p>
<p>dence with, Pichegru.
</p>
<p>S. Of having engaged to re-establish the princes of the house of
</p>
<p>Bourbon on the throne of France : an engagement attested by
</p>
<p>the reports and hearsays circulated in London.
</p>
<p>4. Of having had interviews with Pichegru at Paris ; of having
</p>
<p>rejected certain overtures, but by substituting others, which had
</p>
<p>for object the overthrow of the consular government.
</p>
<p>5. Of not having revealed the residence of Pichegru in Paris.
</p>
<p>Such are the crimes alleged against General Moreau in the act
</p>
<p>of accusation ; and such are the several charges to which it is our
</p>
<p>duty to reply.
</p>
<p>FIRST CHARGE.
</p>
<p>Moreau the accomplice of Pichegru, in the year 5.
</p>
<p>This is a charge which ought not to have been introduced into
</p>
<p>the present process. Of what consequence, in the year 12, to the
</p>
<p>consular, and particularly to the imperial, government, is a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, real or imaginary, the object of which was to annul, in

</p>
<p>the year 4, the fragile constitution of the year 3, which the 18th
</p>
<p>Brumaire so happily reduced to dust, amidst the general plaudits
</p>
<p>of the nation ;
</p>
<p>In what predicament should each of us at this moment appear,
</p>
<p>if the government under which we now so happily repose after a
</p>
<p>tempest of such long continuance, espousing all the quarrels of
</p>
<p>every government which has been erected and proscribed in France,
</p>
<p>during the last fi^fteen years, should demand from us a rigorous
</p>
<p>account of all that we may have done, for or against the old mo-
</p>
<p>narchy of IT'SS, for or against the constitutional monarchy of 1791,
</p>
<p>[1*]
</p>
<p>foi* or against the revolutionary government of the third year, for
</p>
<p>or against the Directories of Vendimiare, of Prairial, or of Fruc-
</p>
<p>tidor ; which have been in such rapid succession overturned by
</p>
<p>each other?
</p>
<p>On the 18th Brumaire France emerged from a chaos. It is
</p>
<p>from that day she should date her existence. All which preceded it
</p>
<p>is involved in midnight darkness. On that day the national will,
</p>
<p>to secure the publick repose, proscribed, en masse, all this tram of
</p>
<p>ephemeral government, and ordained that no man should be ques-
</p>
<p>tioned upon what had been his conduct under their influence.
</p>
<p>It is then a mere mockery to make the conduct of Moreau against
</p>
<p>the Directory, previous to the 18th Fructijdor, a subject of crimi-
</p>
<p>nal enquiry. If he was at that time guilty towards it, what must
</p>
<p>have been his subsequent degree of guilt ? Was it not he, who, on
</p>
<p>the 18th Brumaire, marched to the Luxembourg, and there held
</p>
<p>that feeble authority in awe, whilst, at St. Cloud, another govern-
</p>
<p>inent arose at the wish, and for the happiness, of France.
</p>
<p>This imaginary offence of Moreau against the Directory, in the
</p>
<p>year 4, should not, therefore, form any part in the present accusa-
</p>
<p>tion. But they will tell us that it is only inserted to bring back, fat'
</p>
<p>SL moment, the recollection of that want of duty which is exhibited
</p>
<p>by his letter of the 17th Fructidor, the motives of which were not
</p>
<p>inown, but which a contemplation of his glory, and his victories,
</p>
<p>had long since obliterated.
</p>
<p>Such is not according to regular process, nor consistent with the
</p>
<p>nature of an accusation. In rigorous construction of law, there is
</p>
<p>no necessity of a justification against a charge so advanced. Ne-
</p>
<p>vertheless general Moreau seizes, with pleasure, this occasion to
</p>
<p>explain himself, in the face of the whole nation, on the part he
</p>
<p>acted prior to the 1 8th Fructidor.
</p>
<p>It appears but too true that Pichegru had, in the year 4, main-
</p>
<p>tained a correspondence with the army of the royalists, and the Prince
</p>
<p>of Conde. The plan seems to have been, to cause Louis XVIII
</p>
<p>to be acknowledged, to make the army of the Rhine declare in

</p>
<p>his favour, mount the white cockade, get possession of several
</p>
<p>Strong places, &c. &c.
</p>
<p>But Pichegru and the Prince could not agree on several points ;
</p>
<p>J)articularly whether the right or the left bank of the Rhine should
</p>
<p>be the scene of action in the first instance ; and also on a general
</p>
<p>amnesty, and the confirmation of the sales of national property,
</p>
<p>which the one exacted and the other refused.
</p>
<p>Such is the general purport of the papers of Offenburg. What-
</p>
<p>ever these papers may say as to the charges against Pichegru and
</p>
<p>others, it is most unjust that any suspicion should, from them,
</p>
<p>extend to Moreau, or enter into the act of accusation against him*
</p>
<p>His name is not mentioned in them more than three or four times,
</p>
<p>[ 15 ]
</p>
<p>and alAV ays either to express that he is not in the confidence of Pi"
</p>
<p>ehegru, or in recounting events that have taken place. There is
</p>
<p>not in the whole, one word from which an inference can be drawn
</p>
<p>that he was even tampered with. The Attorney-General has not
</p>
<p>cited, nor can he cite, any thing from them to support the idea.
</p>
<p>Why then has that officer endeavoured to establish such a doubt j
</p>
<p>when not only are these papers devoid of any thing indicating Mo-
</p>
<p>reau to have been involved in the plot, but when all his conduct, at
</p>
<p>that epoch, contradicts even the possibility that he could ever have
</p>
<p>been so ? it was at the moment of its existence that he took upon
</p>
<p>himself the command of the army, to guide it, during a whole,
</p>
<p>year, from one victory to another, into the very heart of Germany,
</p>
<p>and to crown all his treasons, in a manner the most singular, by
</p>
<p>that wonderful retreat, which excited the admiration of the oldest
</p>
<p>generals, even amongst foreigners and enemies.
</p>
<p>Moreau was the accomplice of Pichcgru 1 Happy wretch ! How
</p>
<p>easily might he then have consummated his crime, without incur-
</p>
<p>ring the risk of reproach I He had only to leave the work to for-
</p>
<p>tune ; she alone, in the midst of Germany, in an unknown coun-
</p>
<p>try, surrounded by two powerful armies, would have been fully
</p>
<p>adequate to the destruction of the French. It v/as only nececsary
</p>
<p>that he should not counteract her. He had only to abstain from that
</p>
<p>effort of genius which no person living believed possible. His army
</p>
<p>must have perished, the treason would have succeeded, and the
</p>
<p>traitor, who had had the wonderful art to conceal his perfidy be-
</p>
<p>neath the blandishments of repeated and brilliant victories, would
</p>
<p>have been lamented, caressed, and honoured.
</p>
<p>Away then with this foolish charge, which gives the lie to the
</p>
<p>universal voice of Europe ; and against which the national gratitude
</p>
<p>alone ought to have been his guarantee.
</p>
<p>But, at least, says the act of accusation, he too long delayed to
</p>
<p>disclose to the difectory the plot in which Pichegru was then in-
</p>
<p>volved. We reply :
</p>
<p>1, The papers seized could not be understood until they had

</p>
<p>been decyphered, which necessarily occupied much time. No one
</p>
<p>was there designated by his name ; and the evidences of their ap-
</p>
<p>plication, when they were collated, appeared so little decisive,
</p>
<p>that those who seemed to be implicated by them, being put on ti-ial
</p>
<p>were acquitted ; and it is probable that even Pichegru would him-
</p>
<p>self have been discharged, if, instead of receiving immediate sen-
</p>
<p>tence of deportation, he had been sent to ansv/er before a tribunal.
</p>
<p>2. This plan was to have been put in execution in the year 4, and it
</p>
<p>was now near the close of the year 5, General Moreau command-
</p>
<p>ed the army ; he had every thing under his ccntroul ; he watched
</p>
<p>the suspected ; he arrested the intriguers ; tried and punished the
</p>
<p>spies* All was rendered abortive, broken destroyed. These pro=
</p>
<p>[ 16 ]
</p>
<p>ceedings, and the victories gained over his enemies, will speak bet-
</p>
<p>ter for the disposition infused by him into the army, than any de-
</p>
<p>nunciation of its chief for having endeavoured to corrupt it, could
</p>
<p>possibly do.
</p>
<p>3. Besides, this denunciation must have been directed against Ge-
</p>
<p>neral Pichegru, first the commander and afterwards the friend of
</p>
<p>Moreau. It could have had no other consequence than that of
</p>
<p>sending him a few days sooner to Guyana. But the projects con-
</p>
<p>certed with the prince of Conde in the year 4, and the scheme of
</p>
<p>overturning the government by the army, were matters very dis-
</p>
<p>tinct from what was passing in Paris in the year 5, fi'om all those
</p>
<p>trifling and miserable disputes between the councils, on which the
</p>
<p>Directory, imbecile as it was, had only to breathe, and they were
</p>
<p>annihilated.
</p>
<p>4. Lastly, a proof that general Moreau conducted himself pro-
</p>
<p>perly upon that occasion, is, that the publick opinion, not informed
</p>
<p>of the circumstances which drew from him the letter of the 17th
</p>
<p>Fructidor, censured him with one accord for having written it. 
</p>
<p>Let publick men contemplate the capriciousness of Moreau's situ-
</p>
<p>ation, then universally censured for having denounced Pichegru,
</p>
<p>even at that late day, now accused and brought to trial for not hav-
</p>
<p>ing done it with more alacrity.
</p>
<p>But let us at once put an end to the discussion of this odious
</p>
<p>charge, by an expression, equally distinguished for reason and
</p>
<p>dignity, which escaped from the pardonable impatience of General
</p>
<p>Moreau, when, at the tribunal, he recurred to this point  " If I
</p>
<p>eri-ed, it was an errour agamst the Directory ; which has since
</p>
<p>been sufficiently expiated, by having gained thirty battles, and sav-
</p>
<p>ed two armies."
</p>
<p>SECOND CHARGE.
</p>
<p>Reconciliation and culpable relation -vvith Pichegru, in
</p>
<p>England, through the agency of David and Lajolais.
</p>
<p>The Abbe David, the mutual friend of Pichegru and Moreau,
</p>
<p>conceived the design of reconciling them.

</p>
<p>This was the proper movement of David ; it does not appear
</p>
<p>that any impulse on the part of Moreau had induced him to seek
</p>
<p>this accommodation.
</p>
<p>His first sentiment was to resist it. This is attested by the pro-
</p>
<p><'.eedings of the court.
</p>
<p>David wrote to Pichegru, mentioned the first conference, but
</p>
<p>concealed the repugnance of Moreau, and offered his mediation ;
</p>
<p>which was accepted by Pichegru.
</p>
<p>David again saw Moreau, and insensibly weakened his objec-
</p>
<p>tions.
</p>
<p>Each of the generals thought he had cause of displeastire against
</p>
<p>[ 17 ]
</p>
<p>the other, on circumstances relating to their military and publick
</p>
<p>life.
</p>
<p>By the intervention of David, who communicated to each the
</p>
<p>letters he had received from the other, they explained, were re-
</p>
<p>conciled, and interchanged forgiveness, but without writing to
</p>
<p>each other.
</p>
<p>Things having arrived at this point, nothing appears more natural
</p>
<p>than the letter Avritten by Moreau to David in Messidor, year 10,
</p>
<p>in which he says, that " he would not attempt to justify himself on
</p>
<p>the denunciation he had made ; that if any one had a right to re-
</p>
<p>proach him it was the government and not general Pichegru,
</p>
<p>whom he thought he beheld sufficiently explained in the papers
</p>
<p>found ; but whom he still wished to have saved from an accusa-
</p>
<p>tion ; he regretted that the part which Pichegru had chosen in the
</p>
<p>three last campaigns had confirmed this opinion. As to any thing
</p>
<p>further, that the situation of Pichegru gave him much pain ; that
</p>
<p>he would with pleasure use any means in his power to be useful to
</p>
<p>him ; and that if any one had authority to say that he was the cause
</p>
<p>of that situation, he would immediately remove such an impres-
</p>
<p>sion."
</p>
<p>We cannot but remark, that, notwithstanding the obliging style
</p>
<p>of this letter, notwithstanding the forgetfulness of errours, that
</p>
<p>General Moreau had not recovered from the opinion he had form-
</p>
<p>ed on the conduct of Pichegru. It was constantly, in his eyes, an
</p>
<p>indelible stain.
</p>
<p>The letter itself appeared to David so innocent that he shewed
</p>
<p>it, not only to the friends of Pichegru, but to persons in authority,
</p>
<p>and to distinguished generals, who still preserved a friendship for
</p>
<p>the ex-general.
</p>
<p>As to Moreau himself, his soul the seat of every generous sen-
</p>
<p>timent, incapable of an eternal resentment, could not for a moment
</p>
<p>think there was wrong in ceasing to retain enmity against Pichegru:
</p>
<p>and when that old friend solicited a reconciliation, his heart,
</p>
<p>stronger than any other power, forbad him to refuse it.

<p>Moreau could not believe himself guilty in expressing a wish to
</p>
<p>see Pichegru return to France ; when at the same time he beheld
</p>
<p>every drawing-room in Paris open to the general-officers of the ar-
</p>
<p>my of Conde, whom he had overthrown in battle the year before.
</p>
<p>General Moreau could not believe himself more guilty than other
</p>
<p>generals, who had promised to aid him in procuring permission
</p>
<p>for Pichegru to return ; one of whom especially applied to the First
</p>
<p>Consul in his favour.
</p>
<p>General Moreau could not consider the relations maintained by
</p>
<p>Pichegru with the enemy, in the first month of the year 4, nor his
</p>
<p>subsequent denunciation, as motives now existing to oppose or
</p>
<p>check his exertions to obtain his liberty of return to France.
</p>
<p>[ J8 1
</p>
<p>The dangers which, through Pichegru, threatened the country,
</p>
<p>had long ago passed over ; it was Moreau who averted them. As
</p>
<p>the successor of Pichegru, in the year 4, he had, by almost innu-
</p>
<p>merable victories, taught the imperial and royal armies, that their
</p>
<p>entry into the French territory was forever interdicted. He also
</p>
<p>taught them that they could never know him but as their con-
</p>
<p>querour.
</p>
<p>When he wrote to David the country enjoyed a perfect peace.
</p>
<p>His heart told him, that peace, the friend of indulgence, and the
</p>
<p>companion of every liberal idea, called upon him to forget the er^-
</p>
<p>rours of warfare. This sentiment he the more willingly indulged,
</p>
<p>from the recollection that a council of war, commissioned to try
</p>
<p>those who were charged with being accomplices of Pichegru, had
</p>
<p>acquited them in every instance.
</p>
<p>If, as asserted in the act of accusation, the two generals were
</p>
<p>only reconciled that they might the better concert measures against
</p>
<p>the government, some indication, some germ of this project,
</p>
<p>should be found in the preceeding or concomitant circumstances,
</p>
<p>or in the letters which were written to bring it about.
</p>
<p>Yet those circumstances do not make any such disclosure.
</p>
<p>And the letters do not contain, we will not say an idea, not even
</p>
<p>a word, which betrays on the part of Moreau the least discontent
</p>
<p>towards the government, or criticism upon its measures.
</p>
<p>But the Abbe David prepared to go England ; he was going
</p>
<p>there to convey to Pichegru the sentiments of Moreau ; and Pi-
</p>
<p>chegru remitted to him twelve louis to defray his expenses.
</p>
<p>From the examination in court we learn that Moreau had not
</p>
<p>seen David for fifteen days before his departure ; and when the
</p>
<p>Abbe mentioned his intended journey, contented himself with re-
</p>
<p>questing that his compliments might be delivered to Pichegru.
</p>
<p>As to money, if Pichegru did actually transmit twelve louis to
</p>
<p>David, so small a sum could only have been an offering to the ne-
</p>
<p>cessities of a friend.

</p>
<p>stranger, and which was intended to reverse the French govern-
</p>
<p>ment, could never have been at a loss for twelve louis, to enable
</p>
<p>him to make a journey whose object was to unite the two chiefs of
</p>
<p>the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>And general Moreau, possessing an immense fortune^^ would
</p>
<p>never have left his emissary at the mercy of every necessity.
</p>
<p>David has himself declared that the letter of Pichegru, which
</p>
<p>would have enabled him to draw the twelve louis, was intercepted,
</p>
<p>and that he borrowed, from general Donzelot, ten louis to pay the
</p>
<p>charges of his journey j a journey which was to determine Pichegru
</p>
<p>to come to Paris ; a journey which was in fact to convey the abbe to
</p>
<p>* Report of tiie Grand- Judge, 27 Pluviose, 12.
</p>
<p>[ 19 ]
</p>
<p>kri establishment of 250 pounds sterling a-year in England^ as tu-^
</p>
<p>tor to the son of a nobleman.
</p>
<p>The journey of David involved so little of mystery, that he made
</p>
<p>it known to all the generals of his acquaintance, who were friendly
</p>
<p>to Pichegru, and was even charged by a member of the Senate
</p>
<p>with a letter for that general.
</p>
<p>Arrested at Calais, even aftei* he had obtained his passport^ they
</p>
<p>found upon him, neither letters nor instructions, which could, in
</p>
<p>the slightest possible degree^ bring Moreau's name into question.
</p>
<p>General Moreau was heard to regret the confinement of David
</p>
<p>in the temple. But since when has it been declared treasonable to
</p>
<p>lament the misfortunes of one who had been a friend ? How long is
</p>
<p>it since shackles have rendered sensibility a crime ?
</p>
<p>If David had been the agent of a plot in which Moreau was eon-
</p>
<p>concerned, when arrested, what ought to have been the conduct
</p>
<p>of Moreau ?
</p>
<p>Either he would have endeavoured to remove from himself every
</p>
<p>suspicion which the arrest might have occasioned ; he would have
</p>
<p>preserved himself, by flight, from the punishment attending the
</p>
<p>discovery of his crime ; or he would have endeavoured to aceom*
</p>
<p>plish his object, before the government had become wholly possess-
</p>
<p>ed of his views. Nothing of the kind has been attempted*
</p>
<p>The General took no pains to ascertain whether he was compro*
</p>
<p>mised by the papers found upen David* He remained unconcern-
</p>
<p>edly at home^ without in any thing varying his usual mode of life.
</p>
<p>He held no correspondence on the subject ; nor was David, that
</p>
<p>artisan of intrigue^ replaced by any other*
</p>
<p>For it must be borne in mind, that Lajolais, who is denominated
</p>
<p>his successor, on his own confession, and as appears by the proofs
</p>
<p>at the trial, had no intercourse with Mpreau for nine months after
</p>
<p>the imprisonment of David*
</p>
<p>Nevertheless the peace was not disturbed at the time when Da*
</p>
<p>vid was arrested. AH the usual sources of communication with
</p>
<p>England were open* In two weeks the plot might have been re-

<p>newed at Paris, approved at London, and returned to the capital
</p>
<p>for execution.
</p>
<p>When all are silent^ silence cannot be a crime.
</p>
<p>'And no one will, we apprehend, pretend to say that the pre-
</p>
<p>sence merely of Pichegru in L'ondon, and of Moreau at Paris, can
</p>
<p>constitute a conspiracvt
</p>
<p>As to the cx-general Lajolais, he did not see general Moreau
</p>
<p>until towards the month of PrairiaU year 11 ; when he delivered him
</p>
<p>an open letter of introduction from Pichegru, requesting the aid of
</p>
<p>the general in procuring him an employment. This letter was not
</p>
<p>brought from London by Lajolais ; Pichegru sent it to iiim in
</p>
<p>France ; a circumstance which should be carefully remembered,
</p>
<p>D
</p>
<p>[ 20 ]
</p>
<p>for, until the time of trial, the publick was taught to believe that
</p>
<p>Lajolais had made tv/o journies to England, and that it was on his
</p>
<p>return from the first of these journies that he delivered this letter.
</p>
<p>General Moreau corrected the memoir by which Lajolais solici-
</p>
<p>ted a place.
</p>
<p>They spoke of Pichegru ; and Moreau has not denied that he
</p>
<p>expressed to Lajolais, as he had done to the Abbe David, the sa-
</p>
<p>tisfaction he would derive from his free return into France.
</p>
<p>If this interest for Pichegru is a crime, let it find its excuse in
</p>
<p>the reconciliation lately effected, and in the ingenuous nature of the
</p>
<p>general.
</p>
<p>Lajolais declared, on his first examination, that, on this occa-
</p>
<p>sion, he saw Moreau three or four times j that he had expressed a
</p>
<p>wish to have an interview with Pichegru ; and said he was about
</p>
<p>to request it.
</p>
<p>The desire of this interview has been held up as a sure indication
</p>
<p>f a treasonable understanding between Moreau and Pichegru ;
</p>
<p>the proof of which is said to be established by the visits at Paris.
</p>
<p>Do not the folly and improbability of putting this construction en
</p>
<p>the testimony of Lajolais strike at first sight ?
</p>
<p>We can well conceive an interview between two persons living in
</p>
<p>the same place, or in places adjoining. But for a person in Paris
</p>
<p>to ask an interview of another living in London, and to assign Pa-
</p>
<p>ris as the place of rendezvous, is top ridiculous.
</p>
<p>Yet at the trial Lajolais gave this testimony, and persisted in it
</p>
<p>three times. Such testimony requires to be explained.
</p>
<p>Lajolais is an Alsacian, and does not speak good French. He
</p>
<p>obsen^ed at the time, that the true force of each expression was not
</p>
<p>familiiar to him, and, therefore, that when he used the word /nfer-^
</p>
<p>pierv^ he asked to be understood as indicating, by it, merely the
</p>
<p>desire manifested bjr Moreau to see Pichegru restored to France*
</p>
<p>Which precisely corresponds with the terms used, and the idea in-
</p>
<p>tended. '
</p>
<p>It is quibbling to say that there is a difference between this first

</p>
<p>declaration^ and that of Lajolais when confronted with Moreau,
</p>
<p>until which time he persisted in his original replies. The differ-
</p>
<p>ence is not contradictory but explanatory ; for it only serves to give
</p>
<p>the sense in which he used the word interview. And a v/itness ne-
</p>
<p>ver has been hindered from explaining what he meant by his own
</p>
<p>evidence. To deny him that essential right would be repugnant to
</p>
<p>the principles of justice.
</p>
<p>To satisfy any One that this explanation was honest and sincere;,
</p>
<p>it will oiiiy be necessary to shew that the first declaration, taken li-
</p>
<p>terally, was so palpably improbable, that it was impossible not to
</p>
<p>r^adinife absurdity and falsehood. , .
</p>
<p>-An iter#iew was v/ished for by Moreau j Lajolais was to pro-
</p>
<p>[ 21 ]
</p>
<p>ceed to England to demand it from Pichegru ; and its object was
</p>
<p>to have been, to open, or to put in better train, a plan, of conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Strange 1 that Lajolais entrusted with a coniraission the executi-
</p>
<p>on pf which was a matter, pne would suppose, of immediate neces-
</p>
<p>sity, should have remained in France seven months, after having
</p>
<p>received it from Moreau !
</p>
<p>No ; the mere circumstance of so long a time wasted in inaction
</p>
<p>by Lajolais, with his family in the department of the Lower-Rhine,
</p>
<p>is an unequivocal proof of the falseness of his first declaration, in
</p>
<p>the interpretation it has received.
</p>
<p>Another particular not less important, and which at once de*
</p>
<p>prives Lajolais of the title of agent for Moreau in this supposititious
</p>
<p>plot, is, that his examination in presence of Moreau and tlue pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings of the court have instructed us, that, at the very time
</p>
<p>when he is said to have been employed tP procure this intei'view,
</p>
<p>he asked general Moreau to lend him some money, which the ge*
</p>
<p>neral refused.
</p>
<p>On this fact the examinations have not throv/n the least doubt.-****
</p>
<p>And will it be believed that Moreau, at the very instant when he
</p>
<p>entrusted his secret to Lajolais, and associated him in his plans,
</p>
<p>would have refused to supply him, for the moment, with a fev/
</p>
<p>Louis ?
</p>
<p>, But as no plot can be naatured without funds, it is thejefore evi-
</p>
<p>dent that general Moreau, after having, initiated Lajolais into this
</p>
<p>conspiracy, would necessarily have placed his purse at his command,
</p>
<p>as he had already made him master pf his fortune and his hopes.
</p>
<p>And even could the plot have progressed without money, is it
</p>
<p>reasonable to think, that Moreau, by refusing the supply request-'
</p>
<p>ed, would have been so imprudent as to have run the risk of morti-
</p>
<p>fying the pride of a man who had the power of revealing T^is machi*
</p>
<p>nations.
</p>
<p>Poverty has ever had too great an influence over the passions, to
</p>
<p>allow us to depend entirely on their movements. Moreau might,
</p>
<p>the next moment, have become the victim of a denunciation, pro-

</p>
<p>voked by his own cupidity.
</p>
<p>To the mind of any reasoning being, wllo knows any thing of the
</p>
<p>human heart, the refusal to^ administer with a small sum to the
</p>
<p>necessities of Lajolais, is a proof suMcieilt to destroy every id.ea
</p>
<p>that there existed any criininal relation between him and genei'al
</p>
<p>Moreau.
</p>
<p>But to all these explanatipns which render so plain the nature of
</p>
<p>the momentary acquaintance of Moreau and Lajolais, let lis add
</p>
<p>one other, which will contribute to establish its perfect inoffensive-
</p>
<p>ness.
</p>
<p> Victor Couchery, to whona it appears Lajolais had said that ge?
</p>
<p>aeral Moreau ought-to w4-it^^ tb Ficljegrtt, waited ori the general to
</p>
<p>[ 22 ]
</p>
<p>know what dispositions had been made with Lajolais, and whether
</p>
<p>he did intend to write to Pichegru.
</p>
<p>And Victor Couchery, when confronted with Moreau, has at-
</p>
<p>tested that the reply of the general was, that " he had seen Lajo-
</p>
<p>lais two or three times on the particular concerns of the latter, and
</p>
<p>especially the amendments which he made to his petition for em-
</p>
<p>ployment ; that he had nothing to communicate to, nor could he
</p>
<p>correspond with, any person residing in a countr\ at war with
</p>
<p>France."  Couchery was then the friend of Pichegru j {general
</p>
<p>Moreau knew him to be so : if he had written by Lajolais, if he had
</p>
<p>any intention of writing, or if he had even charged him with a ver-
</p>
<p>bal message, what reason had he to use reserve or concealment
</p>
<p>with the brother of his confidant, and the most intimate friend of
</p>
<p>Pichegru.
</p>
<p>This testimony of Couchery, independent of the proof it affords
</p>
<p>that he had no confidential connexion with Lajolais, confirms ano-
</p>
<p>ther fact perhaps sufficiently established at the trial, that Moreau
</p>
<p>declined ail correspondence with Pichegru so long as he remained
</p>
<p>under the protection of the enemies of France. And that his wish
</p>
<p>was that the latter should remove into a neutral territory, before he
</p>
<p>could in any way interest himself in procuring the erasure of his
</p>
<p>name from the list of emigrants.
</p>
<p>To those who say that any intimacy between Moreau and Lajo-
</p>
<p>lais is liable to suspicion, on account of the denunciation of this
</p>
<p>officer in the year 5 ; it is easy to reply, that Lajolais was absolved
</p>
<p>from all crime by a judgment of the council of war ; that he had
</p>
<p>long since banished from his mind all animosity or resentment
</p>
<p>which his arrest might have occasioned ; and that he himself
</p>
<p>sought the interviews with the general, whose disposition was in-
</p>
<p>capable of repulsing him. Nay it even appeared to him, that
</p>
<p>very sentiment of justice required his aid in repairing the injuries
</p>
<p>which Lajolais might have sustained, from a denunciation proved
</p>
<p>by the trial to have been without just cause.

<p>Moreau promisep to re-establish the Bourbons. A promise
</p>
<p>ATTESTED BY REPORTS CIRCULATED IN LoNDON.
</p>
<p>The particulars collected jn the act of accusation, and upon which
</p>
<p>this charge is made, are as follow.
</p>
<p>Russillon declared that Lajolais had asserted, in London, that
</p>
<p>Moreau, discontented with the government of the First-Consul,
</p>
<p>fished, and would v/ith all his power aid in accomplishing, its
</p>
<p>overthrow.
</p>
<p>Bouvet said that Lajolais cQnfirmed all the hopes which, in Lon-
</p>
<p>don, had been built upon Moreau j that he had en|;ered into th^
</p>
<p>[ 23 ]
</p>
<p>design of the princes ; and promised that he would present the
</p>
<p>prince to the armies.
</p>
<p>Rochelle affirmed that, in London, they calculated on Moreau ;
</p>
<p>without saying that Lajolais was author of the reports.
</p>
<p>And Roger (if we are to take the testimony of four gendarmes
</p>
<p>who guarded him in the temple) had heard it said that Moreau
</p>
<p>was one of the chiefs of the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Thus reports, the author of which is not ascertained, were cir-
</p>
<p>culated at London, that Moreau was a chief in the conspiracy of
</p>
<p>royalists : these reports are attested by two witnesses only, Ro-
</p>
<p>chelle and Roger ; and two other persons under accusation, Russil-
</p>
<p>lon and Eouvet assure us that Lajolais had told the princes that
</p>
<p>Moreau had declared for them.
</p>
<p>Behold all the testimony upon which this important fact must rest.
</p>
<p>We will not consume our time in observing that, at the trial,
</p>
<p>some of these declarations were considerably varied and enfeebled.
</p>
<p>Bouvet in particular avowed that the royalists had been deceived
</p>
<p>by those who had promised Moreau to their party. He even re-
</p>
<p>curred several times, with great energy, to the confidence he had
</p>
<p>with too much facility placed upon the hearsays concerning Moreau.
</p>
<p>Nor is it necessary to notice that the declaration said to have
</p>
<p>been made by Roger at the temple, was formerly denied by him at
</p>
<p>the trial, in presence of two of the gendarmes who reported it; one
</p>
<p>of whom faltered, and the other entirely retracted. This last was
</p>
<p>Gilbert, who expressly said that he knew not how the name of Mo-
</p>
<p>reau had crept into his deposition, as Roger had never, in his pre-
</p>
<p>sence, spoken of him. He forcibly repeated this retraction three
</p>
<p>times.
</p>
<p>We may also be allowed to pass over the improbality that Ro-
</p>
<p>ger, who in all his examinations had denied every charge made
</p>
<p>against him, and had used all his efforts to free himself from that
</p>
<p>of being a conspirator, should afterwards, without any reason or
</p>
<p>provocation, foolishly avow, not to one only, but to a second, a
</p>
<p>third, and a fourth, successively, that he was so ; that he had

</p>
<p>heard Moreau named as one of its chiefs ; and this for the silly
</p>
<p>pleasure of placing a suicidial confidence in four persons utterly un-
</p>
<p>known to him.
</p>
<p>Much less need we seek to divine the extraordinary motives,
</p>
<p>however a knowledge of them might invalidate the testimony,
</p>
<p>which could induce these four gendarmes to insinuate themselves
</p>
<p>into the confidence of their prisoner, and to draw him into such
</p>
<p>conversation as might suit their purpose ; when their duty was
</p>
<p>merely to guard him, and be silent.
</p>
<p>General Moreau is under no necessity of attenuating this charge
</p>
<p>by any of these means.
</p>
<p>We will th?n content ourselves with making, in this place, one
</p>
<p>[ 24. ]
</p>
<p>observation, which. is, that the act of accusation might have exhi-
</p>
<p>bited many other proofs equally substantial, had it pleased Mr.
</p>
<p>Attorney General to have availed himself of them. We are told
</p>
<p>that, last summer, many journalists, in London and America,
</p>
<p>gave positive assurances to the publick that general Moreau had
</p>
<p>raised the standard of revolt against the first consul, and proclaim-
</p>
<p>ed the princes of Bourbon ; indeed the official Gazette of Paris has
</p>
<p>lately found it a-propos to republish extracts from those journals.
</p>
<p>In opposition to those miserable gazetteers, to those rumours
</p>
<p>^vithout authors, of which two of the accused, Rochelle and (as we
</p>
<p>are told) Roger, have spoken, to those reports made by Lajolais (if
</p>
<p>we credit the testimony of two other accused persons, Bouvet and
</p>
<p>Kussillon), let us place a fact to which each of these men has depos-
</p>
<p>ed, and which is even admitted by the act of accusation itself.
</p>
<p>The fact is this ; so far from any engagement on the part of general
</p>
<p>Moreau to aid the cause of the priiices, he, we will not say spurn-
</p>
<p>ed at a proposition to enter into their service, for such proposal
</p>
<p>never was made to him, but resented the bare suggestion, when
</p>
<p>lightly introduced into a political conversation, that with his aid
</p>
<p>they might recover their former authority, in the event that any
</p>
<p>change might, most unhappdy for France, overturn or shake the
</p>
<p>consular government under which we then lived.
</p>
<p>But these ver}^ royalists who had so industriously propagated
</p>
<p>those reports in England, on their arrival in Paris found bitter
</p>
<p>cause of complaint, when they saw how much they had been de-
</p>
<p>ceived : when those who had inspired them with such hopes, were
</p>
<p>forced to acknowledge that they were unfounded, and that Moreau,
</p>
<p>so far from being a royalist, would not even suffer the princes to be
</p>
<p>named in his presence.
</p>
<p>This is not the time to examine how they became acquainted
</p>
<p>with this truth ; nor whether those who informed them of it, did
</p>
<p>not wish, by mingling some thing extraordinary with their story,
</p>
<p>to disarm their resentment and even vengeance, for having abused
</p>
<p>them with such false expectations.

<p>- We merely adduce the fact, in this place, to shew that from Mo-
</p>
<p>yieau they derived no assistance j that he never declared for them 5
</p>
<p>never had an idea of combining with them. :
</p>
<p>If this be correct, and the proceedings at the trial recognize it as
</p>
<p>correct, we are compelled to adopt the inference, that Moreau
</p>
<p>never did receive any advances or propositions from the princes j
</p>
<p>that he never wrote, nor procured to be written, any letter to Lon-
</p>
<p>don, to the princes, to Pichegru, nor to any other person in their
</p>
<p>confidence, neither for the jjurpose of making them any promises,-
</p>
<p>of recalling them or their friends to France, nor of suggesting any
</p>
<p>means of destroj'ing the Consular government* This conclusioq
</p>
<p>ive^are iorced to receive, in order to avoid the most palpable ab-
</p>
<p>[ 25 3
</p>
<p>surdity. For we cannot perceive why geners*! Moreau, whoj ac-
</p>
<p>cording to the lamentations of the royalists, rejected or disdained
</p>
<p>their overtures, should chuse to amuse himself, in a manner cruel
</p>
<p>towards them and dangerous to himself, by sending them emissa-
</p>
<p>ries, inspiring them with hopes, and in fact organizing a plot, when
</p>
<p>all the fruit which he could reap from it, would be to involve him-
</p>
<p>self without the power of being extricated, and without even know-
</p>
<p>ing what object he proposed to attain.
</p>
<p>But it is insisted, in exculpation of the Attorney-General, that
</p>
<p>such reports were current in London.
</p>
<p>Such reports were current ! And at what period of the world has
</p>
<p>a sensible and discriminating people sentenced its generals and de-
</p>
<p>fenders to death on the evidence of reports spread by an enemy ?
</p>
<p>The resource v/ould really be admirable, if nations at war could
</p>
<p>free themselves from magistrates or warriours whom they dreaded,
</p>
<p>by indirectly demanding their heads in a gazette paragraph, or des-
</p>
<p>troying their reputation by an insidious report.
</p>
<p>Such reports were current ! We might deny this assertion : for
</p>
<p>what proof has been adduced to support it, farther than the justly
</p>
<p>suspected declarations of some co-accused persons ; who might,
</p>
<p>for a hundred reasons easily explained, establish fair hopes of safe-
</p>
<p>ty from a well timed and complaisant perjury. We might, we
</p>
<p>say, deny that there have been any such reports, but we choose ra-
</p>
<p>ther to believe in their existence. And why ? Because the Eng-'
</p>
<p>lish, dreading the attack with which they were menaced, doubtless
</p>
<p>wished to create discord in the heart of France. Some chiefs of
</p>
<p>the royalists thinking the circumstance favourable to their cause,
</p>
<p>promoted it. Partizans of the princes were, therefore, to be sent
</p>
<p>to France to fret the publick mind, enroll and encourage the dis-'
</p>
<p>contented. Great motives, strong hopes, and alluring perspectives^
</p>
<p>were necessary to reanimate their audacity, humbled by fifteen
</p>
<p>years of reverses. Is it then extraordinary, that, in such a con-
</p>
<p>juncture, the name of Moreau, that name which had resounded
</p>
<p>through all Europe, shoiild have been prostituted ?

<p>Moreau had been at the head of our armies ; and was still be-i
</p>
<p>loved by them. But he was no longer employed by the govern^
</p>
<p>ment ; and it was seen that he was even treated by it with
</p>
<p>coldness. Some officious propagators of hatred, vile artists of dis-
</p>
<p>cord, who set no value upon their country, imagined they had
</p>
<p>attained the object of their ridiculous ambition, when they had
</p>
<p>sown dissention between those great minds which ought ever to have-
</p>
<p>been united, were not idle in perpetuating this temporary alienation.
</p>
<p>The calumnies against Moreau from thence received a colour, and
</p>
<p>the vile detractions of his loyalty were rendered more plausible.-
</p>
<p>The workers of evil saw their advantage and assiduously dispersed
</p>
<p>these runiours. This no foresight could either anticipate or pre-
</p>
<p>[2S]
</p>
<p>vent* It is a sad truth that a man who has covered himself witli
</p>
<p>glory, and secured general esteem, cannot protect his name against
</p>
<p>the abuse of intriguers, who will commit and calumniate it at plea^
</p>
<p>sure without his knowledge or consent* To render him responsi-
</p>
<p>ble for such abuse of himself would be equally absurd and atrocious^
</p>
<p>When from those artful insinuations, disseminated as a decoy
</p>
<p>for subaltern characters, we ascend to their source, we find it
</p>
<p>cither in some anonymous pamphlet, or in the word of Lajolaisj
</p>
<p>who now contradicts himself. Of the four prisoners who have de-
</p>
<p>posed to their existence, two know not whence they are derived^
</p>
<p>and two only attribute them to Lajolais*
</p>
<p>General Moreau^ availing himself of this disavowal of Lajolais^
</p>
<p>might conclude that the two witnesses, to whom he gives the lie^
</p>
<p>are in errour ; but he is compelled to declare his sentiments at
</p>
<p>large. All the other conduct of Lajolais justifies the presumption
</p>
<p>that he imposed upon Russillon and Bouvet ; and if on them doubt-
</p>
<p>less on many others. Upon this supposition, which is necessary
</p>
<p>to support the hypothesis, in the misery of Lajolais will be found
</p>
<p>the explanation of his conduct.
</p>
<p>General Moreau is too sensibly affected by the cruel necessity
</p>
<p>which obliges him to defend himself agaitist an ignominious accusa-
</p>
<p>tion, to have any desire of gratuitously adding to the weight which
</p>
<p>presses upon Lajolais. But Moreau knowing that Lajolais, what-
</p>
<p>ever may have beeni his object, has wandered from the truth on
</p>
<p>6ther points, can the more easily believe that he has not more
</p>
<p>scrupulously adhered to it on this*
</p>
<p>But why has he imposed upon them ? What reasons could have
</p>
<p>determined him, if his designs were such as are attributed to him,
</p>
<p>to imagine a mission which, at the bar of justice and in presence: of
</p>
<p>Moreau, he acknowledges he never did receive ? To make, in the
</p>
<p>name of general Moreau, promises not only contrary to the duty of
</p>
<p>the general to make, but contrary also to his well known sentiments;
</p>
<p>promises, to make which he formally confesses he never had any
</p>
<p>authority ? In his misery alone will be found the solution of the

</p>
<p>enigma.
</p>
<p>Let us for a moment enquire who this Lajolais is*
</p>
<p>For a considerable time attached to Pichegru^ he at first, from
</p>
<p>the generosity of that general, possessed the means of existence
</p>
<p>and the hopes of advancement. Involved in the year 5, more by
</p>
<p>his indiscretions than by any feal fault, in the misfortunes of his
</p>
<p>friend, he was subjected to two years confinement in prison^ from
</p>
<p>whence he was at last delivered by the judgment of a council of
</p>
<p>war, which acquitted him of being an accomplice of Pichegru. On
</p>
<p>leaving prison he found himself in the very abyss of wretchedness^
</p>
<p>without employment, without money, and without the smallest par-
</p>
<p>ticle of property from which to obtain it. Me lived at first upod
</p>
<p>[ 27 ]
</p>
<p>tvhat he could borrow. It was known, indeed he was obliged td
</p>
<p>acknowledge at his trial, that he was overwhelmed with debts,
</p>
<p>and that he was under fears of arrest for upwards of eighty thou-
</p>
<p>sand francSi This was not likely to obtain him much credit. But
</p>
<p>he must nevertheless live : and when all other means were ex-i
</p>
<p>hausted, he learnt that an aecommodation had taken place between
</p>
<p>Moreau and Pichegru. Every purse and every door were shut
</p>
<p>against him. His imagination could furnish no other resource, than
</p>
<p>to profit by this reconciliation. He calculated that general Moreau
</p>
<p>would chearfully perform the first service that might be solicited
</p>
<p>by Pichegru. He therefore procured, we know not how, a recom-
</p>
<p>mendation from the latter, in which he begged that Moreau would
</p>
<p>endeavourtoprocuresome appointmentybr the poor general Lajolais,
</p>
<p>ruined by his long imprisonment. He took this letter to Gros-^Bois/
</p>
<p>spoke to the general of his old friend and of their reconcilement ;
</p>
<p>received fromhim some common civilities; some amendments to his
</p>
<p>petition 5 and received also the assurance that he would have great
</p>
<p>pleasure in seeing Pichegru freely restored to France ; but nothing
</p>
<p>further. Moreau lived altogether retired ; and could not aid the
</p>
<p>petition of Lajolais. He candidly told him so, and counselled
</p>
<p>him to make application to others.
</p>
<p>This, and two or three other visits at Paris, opened and closed
</p>
<p>this acquaintance. At last, he told Moreau that he was about to
</p>
<p>return to Alsace, his native country, and requested to be aided
</p>
<p>with some money. But as no friendship for Lajolais required the
</p>
<p>exercise of its duties, and as he knew that it would be so much
</p>
<p>money lost, the general refused. This is also a fact verified at the
</p>
<p>trial. Lajolais departed for Alsace ; and Moreau, hearing nothing
</p>
<p>more of him, suffered hiiri to pass entirely from his memory;
</p>
<p>After he had remained, as we learn by the testimony of Cou-
</p>
<p>chery, for a few months in Alsace, detained there by a poverty
</p>
<p>which denied him the power of travelling, he at last found means
</p>
<p>of paying his passage to England ; whither he might go with some
</p>
<p>projects for augmenting his resources^ At that moment the de-

<p>sign of throwing back on France these inquietudes which she had
</p>
<p>caused in Great-Britain, fermented in every brain. An invasion
</p>
<p>of royalists was a desirable thing, to parry the threatened descent
</p>
<p>on England. The hopes of obtaining bread, might have induced
</p>
<p>Lajolais to avail himself of .those dispositions. It is not possi-
</p>
<p>ble to ascertain how far he imposed upon Pichegru, and the credu-
</p>
<p>lous royalists, concerning the state of France, nor how far he may
</p>
<p>have misused the name of Moreau j but the history of this pro-
</p>
<p>cess, the different circumstances disclosed by the trial, the words
</p>
<p>which are attributed to him by two of the accused, with much ap-
</p>
<p>pearance of truth, the conduct which he has observed at Paris,
</p>
<p>the evident falsehoods which he first advanced, then retracted,
</p>
<p>E
</p>
<p>C 28 ]
</p>
<p>and afterwards explained, with some considerable embarrassment?
</p>
<p>all these circumstances vmited, explain to Moreau that Lajolais, to
</p>
<p>obtain food, and to render himself of more consequence to those
</p>
<p>from whom he wished to extract a few guineas, had formed an in-
</p>
<p>genious plot* J promised them, in France, names and supports
</p>
<p>which they were not less dismayed than disappointed at not finding -, 
</p>
<p>and that he thus implicated in this detestable ajEfair, the name and |
</p>
<p>honour of general Moreau, into whose mind such ideas never had |
</p>
<p>entered, and from which Lajolais was at that moment removed ta 'I
</p>
<p>the greatest possible distance.
</p>
<p>This is supported by every degree of probability. If Lajolais
</p>
<p>originated those reports in London, reports belied (according to
</p>
<p>the avowal of all those who have been arrested) by the conduct of
</p>
<p>Moreau, is it not evident that he told falsehoods concerning Mo-
</p>
<p>reau; and if he did implicate Moreau by those falsehoods, he cer-
</p>
<p>tainly must have had a motive.  This motive could be no other
</p>
<p>than a scheme to procure subsistence. But because it was advan-.
</p>
<p>tageous to Lajolais to prostitute the name of Moreau in London,
</p>
<p>and to involve him in a party, is it right that general Moreau should
</p>
<p>be responsible for an unjustifiable conduct, by which he is already
</p>
<p>the greatest or only sufferer.
</p>
<p>A last word shall close the examination of this charge.
</p>
<p>General Moreau shudders with horrour at the bare idea that he
</p>
<p>should be even suspected of having entered into any project against
</p>
<p>the government ; of having einployed either Lajolais or any other
</p>
<p>person as a missionary to Pichegru, to the princes, or to England.
</p>
<p>He solemnly denies it. Not one sentence from his pen accuses,
</p>
<p>him. No witness, not one solitary witness has deposed to this
</p>
<p>pretended mission. And, thank heaven 1 neither popular rumours,
</p>
<p>nor the daring assertions of one man, who afterwards contradicts
</p>
<p>his own declarations, are, at this day, authority upon which to
</p>
<p>send a man to the scaffold.
</p>
<p>But to show, by a single trait, how much these ridiculous sto-
</p>
<p>ries, invented by the turbulent to deceive the weak, merit the con^

<p>tempt rather than the thunders of justice, we need only remark that
</p>
<p>the most respectable names, even that of his imperial majesty him-
</p>
<p>self, have not been spared by them j and if two of the accused have
</p>
<p>sworn that they heard, in London, that Moreau was in the interest
</p>
<p>of the princes, two others have implicated Buonaparte j one of
</p>
<p>them, Noel Ducorps, affirms that he had been told by his brother,
</p>
<p>that the project to re-establish the princes, had met the sanction of
</p>
<p>Buonaparte^ and the other, Rochelle, says that Lajolais told him
</p>
<p>* The word in the original is one of the many coined by the revolutionists to express
</p>
<p>what in their new order of things were declared to be crimes. The phrase is,  " aourdi

<p>that the French armies were at the disposal of Morcau, that every
</p>
<p>thing was prepared for placing the Bourbons on the throne, and that
</p>
<p>Buonaparte himself was no stranger to this plan.
</p>
<p>After this, is there one man of common sense who could allow

<p>the fate of another to rest upon the evidence of such fables, which
</p>
<p>not only attack the highest names, but outrage all probability. But

<p>as we have already said too much on a charge so silly and incon-

<p>gruous, we shall now proceed to one of much greater importanceo
</p>
<p>FOURTH CHARGE.
</p>
<p>Interviews with Pichegru, and other Royalists ; Overtures
</p>
<p>MADE OR received.
</p>
<p>Seven months had elapsed since Moreau had heard the name of
</p>
<p>Lajolais, when one morning, about the close of last winter, he re-
</p>
<p>ceived a visit from that gentleman. In that visit he learnt from
</p>
<p>him, with infinite surprise, that Pichegi-u was then in Paris. La-
</p>
<p>jolais pressed him to consent to see Pichegru, who wished to con-
</p>
<p>cert the manner of procuring his publick return to France. Mo-
</p>
<p>reau refused : observing, that his return to France, without the
</p>
<p>authority of government, subjected him, if recognized, to arrest,
</p>
<p>and that he did not think it prudent, as that arrest might take place
</p>
<p>even during their interview, to expose himself to every false in-
</p>
<p>terpretation that might be given to such a circumstance: particu-
</p>
<p>larly as he had sufficiently suffered from such misrepresentation,
</p>
<p>in consequence of the letter of the 17th Fructidor, then and since
</p>
<p>so little understood. Lajolais however pressed the subject, and
</p>
<p>proposed several places of meeting, insisting on the strong desire
</p>
<p>Pichegru had to speak with him. Moreau, on his side, as obsti-
</p>
<p>nately persisted to refuse this indulgence.
</p>
<p>He thought that he should hear no more on this subject, when,
</p>
<p>about eight o'clock on an evening early in Pluviose last, Lajolais
</p>
<p>and two other persons were announced. He repaired to the hall
</p>
<p>and there found Lajolais, Pichegru, and Couchery. This Cou-
</p>
<p>chery was the friend of Lajolais, who, about eight months before,
</p>
<p>had waited on Moreau to know if he had any letter to send to Pi-

</p>
<p>chegru, and who received from Moreau the answer that he had no
</p>
<p>communication t6 make to that gentleman, and farther, that he
</p>
<p>certainly could not hold any relation with him while he remained in
</p>
<p>a country at war with France.
</p>
<p>Moreau was extremely embarrassed at this meeting ; after what
</p>
<p>had passed in the year 5, he never could have pardoned himself
</p>
<p>had Pichegru now been arrested in his house. He shewed him in-
</p>
<p>to a library adjoining the hall, where they remained some minutes.
</p>
<p>In this interview Pichegru spoke only of his desire to be erased
</p>
<p>from the list of emigrants, of his wish to be allowed to return to
</p>
<p>[ 30 ]
</p>
<p>France, of the means of procuring a passport, of their former com-
</p>
<p>rades, &c. &c. Moreau advised him, ii he wished to procure his
</p>
<p>amnesty to quit England, and remove for some time into Germany^
</p>
<p>He then begged him to retire, assuring him that if he could be of
</p>
<p>any service to him he would see him with pleasure, but that not be-
</p>
<p>ing the case, he wished him not to repeat his visit. They were to-
</p>
<p>gether twelve or fifteen minutes. When they rejoined Lajolais,
</p>
<p>Moreau reproached him for having brought Pichegru to his house j
</p>
<p>and, as to himself, desired that he might never return to it.
</p>
<p>Certainly nothing could be less offensive than this interview.-
</p>
<p>One proof that it could not be otherwise is its brevity. In a quar-
</p>
<p>ter of an hour it was impossible to unfold the plan of a conspiracy*
</p>
<p>Therefore those who speak of overtures made by Pichegru, assign
</p>
<p>them to a second meeting.
</p>
<p>Moreau did not wish again to see neither Pichegru nor Lajolais.
</p>
<p>He had at this first meeting expressly told them so. And in effect
</p>
<p>Lajolais did not return. JBut some days afterwards a Monsieur
</p>
<p>Roland, who, in the years 4, 5, 8, and 9, had served under Moreau
</p>
<p>in the army -of the Rhine, as inspector of the military transports,
</p>
<p>and was in the habit of occasionally paying his respects to him,
</p>
<p>waited on him in the morning. He asked a rendezvous for Piche-
</p>
<p>gru, who lodged at his house. Moreau refused it. Roland ob-
</p>
<p>served that he had something important to impart. Moreau per^
</p>
<p>sisted in his refusal ; but to soften this denial to an old friend in
</p>
<p>distress, told Roland that he would, if necessary, send his secrcr
</p>
<p>tary to receive the communication of Pichegru.
</p>
<p>He patiently waited until evening for a reply, when he was told
</p>
<p>a person waited upon him, and on repairing to his cabinet to his
</p>
<p>great astonishment found M. Pichegru. Moreau was much cha-
</p>
<p>grined ; but as no indiscretion had escaped the general at his last
</p>
<p>visit, it would have been ridiculous and indecent to have shewn re-
</p>
<p>sentment, or to have ordered him out of the house.
</p>
<p>Conversation at first turned on the embarrassments of Pichegru,
</p>
<p>on his desire .of leave to return into France, and of obtaining a pass-

</p>
<p>port. But after some vague remarks, it fell upon politicks ; a
</p>
<p>thing not be wondered at, when the important parts that each of
</p>
<p>them had acted are remembered. Pichegru spoke of the intended
</p>
<p>descent on England, of the dangers which might arise from the
</p>
<p>?ibsence of the first consul, and of the changes which this event
</p>
<p>might occasion. It was then that he hinted something of the pro-
</p>
<p>gress of opinion, divested of its republican prejudices, concerning
</p>
<p>the Bourbons, their misfortunes, and their pretensions. Without
</p>
<p>developing any determinate plan, but merely as if by a supposition
</p>
<p>that any misfortune should ensue the invasion, and that, in conse^
</p>
<p>jquence, parties should again arise to distract France, he seemed
</p>
<p>gpdeayouring to sound Moreau upon his dispositioiii towards tha^
</p>
<p>[ 31 ]
</p>
<p>family.  -At that moment, and for the first time, not the disclosure
</p>
<p>of a conspiracy, but some shght insinuations, or as they are called
</p>
<p>overtures, concerning what might interest France in the event of a
</p>
<p>failure of the intended invasion, were made to Moreau. He drily,
</p>
<p>formally, and Avith minute exactness, repulsed every idea that their
</p>
<p>return was possible, oi that such an order of things as these re-
</p>
<p>marks seemed to have in view could ever exist, being totally in*
</p>
<p>compatible with the national temper. Nothing in the whole pro-
</p>
<p>cess is better attested than this conversation ; which terminated
</p>
<p>here, with renewed and urgent entreaties, on the part of Moreau,
</p>
<p>tibat Pichegru might not return. He promised, and departed.
</p>
<p>Their parting was cold, and Pichegru seemed much discontent-
</p>
<p>ed. No one was present at this conversation ; but the dissatisfac-
</p>
<p>tion exhibited by Pichegru on his retiring from it, is mathemati-
</p>
<p>cally proven. Roland, whose good will for that general cannot be
</p>
<p>doubted, tells us that on his return he said, Moreau is not of my
</p>
<p>tvay of thinking, Lajolais and Couchery depose that he seemed
</p>
<p>much chagrined. The intentions which were attributed to Moreau,
</p>
<p>and the reports circulated of his sentiments, will easily account for
</p>
<p>the mortification occasioned by the disappointment of Pichegru.
</p>
<p>However this may be, after these insinuations and the unfavour-
</p>
<p>able reception given them by Moreau, he saw no more of Pichegru.
</p>
<p>It will be recollected that he also shut his door on Lajolais. All
</p>
<p>the ties between him and Pichegru were in a manner broken. Ro-
</p>
<p>land alone had not yet been forbidden to see him. He came again
</p>
<p>to his house the next day. He brought back the conversation to,
</p>
<p>some of the ideas that fell from Pichegru the day before. A politi-
</p>
<p>cal discussion between men who had known each other almost eight
</p>
<p>years, was nothing uncommon. Roland took up the text of Pi-
</p>
<p>chegru. He spoke of the possible evils that might attend the inva-
</p>
<p>sion ; of the commotions that might result from it ; of the preten-
</p>
<p>sions of the Bourbons, who might profit by those commotions ;
</p>
<p>and plunged into a labyrinth of possibilities, fronpi which he could
</p>
<p>not extricate himself, and each of which, he avows, were treated

<p>by Moreau as mere marks of folly.
</p>
<p>Passing from these primary ideas to others, he questioned Mo-
</p>
<p>reau if he had never resolved, in case of new troubles, to possess
</p>
<p>himself of any authority. The notion of such a thing appeared to
</p>
<p>Moreau so ridiculous, that he replied to it with a smile of con-
</p>
<p>tempt  -" That if any new commotions should take place, there
</p>
<p>was a senate to controul them. He Jioped he was not mad ; and
</p>
<p>observed, that before a mere individual, like himself, retired
</p>
<p>from the world, isolated from all affairs civil or military, could be
</p>
<p>animated by any ambitious project, he must either be abandoned
</p>
<p>by his reason, or the whole machine of state must be deranged, the
</p>
<p>^consul, his family, and all those who then possessed authority,
</p>
<p>[ 32]
</p>
<p>must be no more  That the time for him to have coveted power,
</p>
<p>had he ever been ambitious, was when he was at the head of victo-
</p>
<p>rious armies/'  Roland receiving this check soon after withdrew.
</p>
<p>The General affirms this to be the true and minute history of all
</p>
<p>his relations and conversations with Pichegru and Roland. No
</p>
<p>one assisted at their interviews, nor was a witness of what passed.
</p>
<p>No writing by the hand of Moreau exists on the subject. Piche-
</p>
<p>gru is no more ; but no word uttered by him contradicts what is
</p>
<p>here stated. It appears therefore, not only contravening the pre-
</p>
<p>sumption of law in favour of innocence, but also a contradiction of
</p>
<p>the first principles of common reason, to imagine other facts or
</p>
<p>other discources than v/hat are here stated.
</p>
<p>Why then has the act of accusation called these conversations
</p>
<p>criminal, and what has been produced in conti'adiction of general
</p>
<p>Moreau ?
</p>
<p>According to the act of accusation, there had been another in-
</p>
<p>terview on the Boulevard-de-la-Madeleine, between him and Pi-
</p>
<p>chegru, at nine o'clock in the evening. Lajolais deposes to this
</p>
<p>interview in one of his examinations ; and Couchery says he knew
</p>
<p>of it, but at the trial confessed that his knowledge was from Lajo-
</p>
<p>lais. Eouvet-de-LoEier, in a most extraordinary declaration,
</p>
<p>signed by him some moments after having been saved from suicide,
</p>
<p>says that he repaired to the Boulevard-de-la-Madeleine, on the
</p>
<p>day mentioned, with Pichegru, Lajolais, and others ; that Lajo-
</p>
<p>lais came to Pichegru in a voiture to conduct him to Moreau ; and
</p>
<p>that there had been a conference between them in the Champs-
</p>
<p>Elysees, from which they had every reason to believe that Moreau
</p>
<p>was opposed to the royalists.
</p>
<p>According to the act of accusation, Armand Polignac knew, by
</p>
<p>hearsay, that there had been a conference between Moreau, Pi-
</p>
<p>chegru, and Georges, at Chaillot.
</p>
<p>According to the act of accusation, Picot declared that one day
</p>
<p>Pichegru expected some person in the Champs-Elysees, who did
</p>
<p>not meet him- The Attorney-General, in admitting that Moreau

</p>
<p>did not meet him, indicates that he expected Moreau ; and that he
</p>
<p>would not have expected him, had he not received his promise to
</p>
<p>he there.
</p>
<p>According to the act of accusation, on the word of Lajolais, it
</p>
<p>is stated that Moreau appointed the first meeting with Pichegru at
</p>
<p>his house.
</p>
<p>According to the act of accusation, on the word of Roland, Mo-
</p>
<p>reau also appointed the second meeting with Pichegru, at his own
</p>
<p>house, and even sent Fesnieres to conduct him.
</p>
<p>And according to the act of accusation, Moreau, on the word of
</p>
<p>Roland, at their last conference, after having in form rejected
</p>
<p>*yery proposition to unite in the views of the royalists, proposed
</p>
<p>[ 33 ]
</p>
<p>that thejr should adopt an entirely different plan ; that they should
</p>
<p>remove out of the way both the First Consul and the Governour of
</p>
<p>Paris, and that he, Moreau, would avail himself of a party in the
</p>
<p>Senate sufficiently strong, to obtain the supreme authority ; and
</p>
<p>that he should then be left to act in the cause according to the dic-
</p>
<p>tates of his own mind.
</p>
<p>He must reply to all these charges in the order in which they
</p>
<p>stand; the necessity of justifying himself is distressing ; but the
</p>
<p>task is not difficult.
</p>
<p>General Moreau has acknowledged that he saw Pichegru at his
</p>
<p>house. But whether he did or did not consent to meet him on the
</p>
<p>Boulevard-de-la-Madeleine ; whether he did or did not promise to
</p>
<p>meet him at Chaillot, to which place it appears he did not go ; whe-
</p>
<p>ther he did or did not assign a rendezvous in the Champs-Elysees,
</p>
<p>which he did not keep : whether the first visit at his own house
</p>
<p>was by appointment at the instance of Lajolais, or altogether un-
</p>
<p>expected by him ; whether he had granted or refused to grant the
</p>
<p>request of Roland for a second meeting ; whether he sent his secre-
</p>
<p>tary to conduct Pichegru to his house, or to learn his wishes and
</p>
<p>forbid his coming ; appear, at this moment, matters of the most
</p>
<p>perfect indifference one way or the other.
</p>
<p>There could certainly be no crime in promising to meet Pichegru
</p>
<p>at Chaillot or the Champs-Elysees when no performance followed.
</p>
<p>There could be no crime in seeing Pichegru once on the Boulevard-
</p>
<p>de-la-Madeleine, whom he has acknowledged to have twice seen
</p>
<p>at his own house. There could be no crime in yielding to see him
</p>
<p>at the request of Lajolais or Roland. Nor could there be a crime in
</p>
<p>sending his secretary to conduct Pichegru, or to enquire his business.
</p>
<p>Further, if Moreau, instead of wishing the truth only to appear,
</p>
<p>had consulted his own interests, far from divesting the testimony
</p>
<p>of these spurious allegations, he would have assiduously collected
</p>
<p>them : for had they all remained in the process, as they were given
</p>
<p>by their authors, without contradiction, who does not perceive that
</p>
<p>they would have been eminently justificatory ?

</p>
<p>Then we should have been obliged to believe Lajolais, who says
</p>
<p>that when, on Tuesday, he solicited a meeting in the Bouvelai^d-
</p>
<p>de-la-Madeleine, Moreau postponed it until Friday, on account of
</p>
<p>a hunting party which he expected would take place in the interim.
</p>
<p>Is this probable ? Moreau sends a messenger to Pichegru, in Eng-
</p>
<p>land, inviting him to Paris to co-operate in forming a conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Pichegru, obedient to the call, arrives, burning with desire to
</p>
<p>meet his accomplice ; and it is but reasonable to suppose an equal
</p>
<p>anxiety on the part of Moreau to unbosom himself to Pichegru.
</p>
<p>Lajolais, who had been the envoy to England, urges that meeting
</p>
<p>to effect which he had been at so much trouble ; and Moreau puts
</p>
<p>it off from Tuesday until Friday 1 he post-pones it four days because
</p>
<p>tu]
</p>
<p>there migHt be a hunt ! a hunt which however did not take place i
</p>
<p>Truly a most worthy cause for deferring an affair of such import-
</p>
<p>ance ! And the general has shewn himself a most coiniical kind 6f
</p>
<p>a conspirator, who leaves his cotnplotters in a suspense of fout
</p>
<p>days, and for what ? for a hunt ? Not so : because, forsooth, he
</p>
<p>expected to be one of a hunting party ! ! ! And can any one be so
</p>
<p>weak as to suppose that such a circumstance could have power to
</p>
<p>interrupt a plan of conspiracy i
</p>
<p>Then we should be obliged to believe the hearsays cbllected by
</p>
<p>Bouvet, who tells us he heard that, in this conference, Moreau
</p>
<p>gave reason to apprehend the formal refiisal to intermeddle in the
</p>
<p>affairs of the royalists, which, according to hirti, was afterwards
</p>
<p>given ; and by Victor Couchery who says, that on the appearance
</p>
<p>oi an unknown person, which by report must have been Georges,
</p>
<p>Moreau retired, and that the interview with Pichegru was suc-
</p>
<p>cinct and cold. If the appearance of Georges put Moreau to flight,
</p>
<p>Moreau, then, could not have been a conspirer with Georges 1 If
</p>
<p>the int irview with Pichegru was cold and brief, Moreau did not at
</p>
<p>that time distinguish himself by an alacrity and ardour in the cause
</p>
<p>of the proscribed ! And if from this concise conversation the roy-
</p>
<p>alists could foresee that Moreau would not unite with them, as the
</p>
<p>reports in London had taught them to hope, then it is evident that
</p>
<p>Moreau was not one of their party, and that he had not authorized
</p>
<p>those reports !
</p>
<p>And we must also believe that if Moreau did promise to go to
</p>
<p>Chaillot and to the Champs-Elysees, he was not there, for this is
</p>
<p>accorded by the act of accusation. But at the same time we must
</p>
<p>admit, that, so far from recalling Pichegru from England, so far
</p>
<p>from entering into a conspiracy with him, so far from having any
</p>
<p>interest in common with him, he evidently demonstrated, by all
</p>
<p>these appointments made and disregarded, by these pretexts of
</p>
<p>hunting parties, by this coldness at their conferences, the strongest
</p>
<p>repugnance to any relation with Pichegru; and if unwilling to con-
</p>
<p>fer with him, consequently that he had no share in any of his pro-

</p>
<p>jects, whatever those might be.
</p>
<p>If, therefore, the general denies all these assertions, it is not be-
</p>
<p>cause the interest of hi s defence requires him to do so, for that interest,
</p>
<p>we have seen, would be better promoted by suffering them to be
</p>
<p>believed, but it is from his love of truth ; it is because it does not
</p>
<p>depend on him that things are not as represented 'f it is because he
</p>
<p>cannot, by his silence, be thought to admit that he had promised
</p>
<p>to go to the Boulevard-de-la-Madeieine, to Chaillot, nor to the
</p>
<p>Champs-Elysees, when he had made no such promises ; it is be-,
</p>
<p>cause he cannot assent to the assertion that the visits of Pichegru
</p>
<p>were by appointment, when they were not merely unexpected but
</p>
<p>forbidden.
</p>
<p>, . [ 35 ]
</p>
<p>He denies having been, as alleged, at the Boulevard-de-la-Ma"
</p>
<p>deleine^ and no one has deposed to having seen him there. Geor-
</p>
<p>ges did not see him. Bouvet did not see him. Villeneuve did not
</p>
<p>See himi Couchery and Bouvet spoke of this interview on report,
</p>
<p>and concluded that it came from Lajolais. In his written exami-
</p>
<p>nation Lajolais seemed to say that Moreau had been there. On
</p>
<p>the trial he complained that they had incorrectly stated his replies?
</p>
<p>he prevaricated, excused, and explained. It is evident that he
</p>
<p>did what he could to withdraw his first declarations. He said he
</p>
<p>thought he had seen Moreau, but that he could not be positive :
</p>
<p>that he could not be quite certain^ that he had appointed such a
</p>
<p>mee;ting ; nor could he decidedly assert that Pichegru and Moreau
</p>
<p>were there: at the same time. We shall soon see why Lajolais first
</p>
<p>reported this rendezvous, and afterwards testified to it on his ex-
</p>
<p>amination.
</p>
<p>He denies having been at Chaillot. The posters of the house
</p>
<p>where Pichegru lodged in this fauxbourg, have declared that they
</p>
<p>never saw him there. Of this fact there is not the least proof.
</p>
<p>He denies having been at the Champs-Elysees ; he denies hav-
</p>
<p>ing promised to be there j and no one, neither witness nor accused,
</p>
<p>has attested such promise. It was reserved for the act of accusa-
</p>
<p>tion to say that soniebody was expected there ; and as somebody
</p>
<p>was expected ; it could be none other than Moreau ; and that as
</p>
<p>^e was expected he must have promised. Can any one look for a
</p>
<p>efutation of such reasoning ! In civil matters it would be despised;
</p>
<p>o attempt to introduce it where the life is involved is in the ex-
</p>
<p>reme unjust and cruel.
</p>
<p>Yet these meetings have existed in report, and Lajolais, who
</p>
<p>"ppears to be their author, has said that that at la Madeleine took
</p>
<p>place. How shall we explain those assertions of Lajolais, con-
</p>
<p>cerning these different assignations at la Madeleine, Chaillot,
</p>
<p>and the Champs-Elysees ; for we must attribute them to him ?
</p>
<p>They explain themselves very siiiiply.
</p>
<p>We have already been forced to adopt a conjecture, which, how-

</p>
<p>ever painful, we must recall to mind. Lajolais appears to have
</p>
<p>given hopes to the royalists respecting Moreau j and his apparent
</p>
<p>usefulness in the progress of their designs may have procured him
</p>
<p>a few guineas. This might succeed very well while they reihain-
</p>
<p>ed in England*
</p>
<p>But they came to France. Lajolais either followed or met them
</p>
<p>here. Here he doubtless was forcibly urged to effect a conference
</p>
<p>between Moreau and the rdyalists, and to procure a confirmation
</p>
<p>of his pretended engagements* His embarrassment may be well
</p>
<p>imagined^ when required to bring to issue a mission he had never
</p>
<p>received, to confirm promises that had never been made. But
</p>
<p>it would not have suited his purposes to have made a bland cone6
</p>
<p>[36]
</p>
<p>"^1611 that he had deceived the royalists merely to procure "money,
</p>
<p>but without any design of being their colleague. He set to work i
</p>
<p>anew. He contrived to approach Moreau, and endeavoured ta
</p>
<p>draw him into some in^prudent measures. Not being able to effect
</p>
<p>his purpose this way, he appears to have invented a promised ren^
</p>
<p>dezvous ; but to calm the impatience of Pichegru he told him, as
</p>
<p>the proceedings attest, that it was postponed on account of a hunt-
</p>
<p>ing party. He then promised a meeting on the Boulevard-de-la-
</p>
<p>Madeleine, where he says Moreau was ; none other however saw
</p>
<p>him ; and to one he tells that the appearance of Georges made Mo-
</p>
<p>reau withdraw, to others that he spoke but one word which clearly
</p>
<p>evinced his apathy. His next promised meeting was in the Champs
</p>
<p>Elysees ; thither they repaired but met no one. He then took the
</p>
<p>only part left him, and conducted Pichegru to the house of Mo-
</p>
<p>reau, declaring it to have been by appointment of the latter.
</p>
<p>Thus we see how Lajolais has been drawn, perhaps in spite cf
</p>
<p>himself, and without any real design of injuring general Moreaij;
</p>
<p>into these falsehoods, merely to avoid dangerously committing
</p>
<p>himself with those to whom^ in London^ he had sold his fables for
</p>
<p>a subsistence. Here also we see the explanation of his conduct
</p>
<p>at the trial, where^ in the presence of that illustrious man who has
</p>
<p>been brought into jeopardy by his inventions, conscience asserted
</p>
<p>her terrible influence over him* He was evidently divided between
</p>
<p>personal interest and pride, which forbad him to acknowledge him-
</p>
<p>self an impostor ; and personal honour and probity, which com-
</p>
<p>manded him not to bear false witness against general Moreau ; and
</p>
<p>compelled him to re-examine his former declarations, to affirm that
</p>
<p>they had not been correctly stated, or to avow that, not being a
</p>
<p>Frenchman^ he was not aware of the full latitude of his own ex-
</p>
<p>pressions ; to explain away those which might imply guilt j to con-
</p>
<p>fess that he might have been mistaken, that Moreau had not pro-
</p>
<p>mised a rendezvous at the Boulevard-de-la-Madeleine, that he was
</p>
<p>not there, and that, in one word, he had never been employed by
</p>
<p>Moreau as an emissary to London, nor as a mean of communication

</p>
<p>with the royalists. This tardy sacrifice to truths if not sufficient
</p>
<p>to repair all the injury done to Moreau by Lajolais, yet entitles
</p>
<p>the latter to some degree of indulgence.
</p>
<p>We continue to state the denials of General Moreau.
</p>
<p>He denies having assented to receive the first visit of Pichegru
</p>
<p>at his house 5 and, independent of the tergiversations of Lajolais,
</p>
<p>probability alone will satisfy any one that it was not with his con-
</p>
<p>sent. Lajolais even from his first interrogation has declared that
</p>
<p>this visit was at a time when general Moreau was surrounded by
</p>
<p>his friends. According to the custom for some late years prevalent
</p>
<p>in the principal houses in the capital, the general had appointed
</p>
<p>one day in each week to entertain a kind of periodical society.^
</p>
<p>[ 37 ]
</p>
<p>On this day PIchegru made his first visit. Surely had Moreau'.
</p>
<p>appointed the time for a meeting, we will not say with Pichegru
</p>
<p>the conspirator, but with Pichegru the proscribed, to whose safety
</p>
<p>every degree of precaution was necessary, he never would have
</p>
<p>named this day in particular, and designated the very hour, when^
</p>
<p>by the laws of fashion, his doors must have been crowded by the
</p>
<p>influx of company, It is at least a consolation for general Mo-
</p>
<p>reau, that, almost in every instance, the act of accusationj as it
</p>
<p>concerns him, is at open war with common sense.
</p>
<p>It is this common sense that again gives the contradiction to Ro-
</p>
<p>land, when he assures us that Moreau had assented to the second
</p>
<p>interview with Pichegru, and had sent his secretary to conduct
</p>
<p>him. Moreau on the contrary asserts that he refused to grant this
</p>
<p>interview, and that to free himself from the solicitations of Ro-
</p>
<p>land, he sent his secretary to enquire what was the will of Piche-
</p>
<p>gru in requesting it. Which of these opposite assertions will be-
</p>
<p>credited?  That which does not ofi'end iagainst probability ; that
</p>
<p>of Moreau.
</p>
<p>What was the business of Roland with Moreau ? to ask a ren-.
</p>
<p>dezvous for Pichegru ? it is granted. Is any. thing more simple
</p>
<p>than the conclusion that follows. Roland asks Moreau to permit
</p>
<p>fche visit of Pichegru ; Moreau assents ; Roland goes away con-
</p>
<p>tented ; Pichegru comes at the appointed time, either alone, for
</p>
<p>he already knew the way, or with Roland from whom he had na'
</p>
<p>concealment. Where then the necessity of employing M. Fes-'
</p>
<p>nieres ? Why should he bear to Pichegru a message which would
</p>
<p>have been more safely entrusted to Roland ? It was necessary that
</p>
<p>Pichegru should be known to as few persons as possible. If then
</p>
<p>the intermediacy of a fourth person Avas resorted to, it must have
</p>
<p>been because it was rendered indispensable by some purpose ior
</p>
<p>which Roland was unfit ; it was because general Moreau not wish-
</p>
<p>ing the visit of Pichegru, who, according to Roland, had some-
</p>
<p>thing serious to communicate, and desiring to be at once rid of all
</p>
<p>importunity, sent his secretary to receive his communicatiouo

</p>
<p>Every conclusion of reason and logick on this point, is in favour of
</p>
<p>the assertion of Moreau, and against Roland. It is then Roland
</p>
<p>who is untrue. . -. . i
</p>
<p>He is untrue on a point still more important. We must now
</p>
<p>speak of that monstrous charge of which he is the author, and the
</p>
<p>bare allusion to which makes the soul recoil with horrour.
</p>
<p>We must remember that, according to the declaration of all the
</p>
<p>accused, not excepting either Lajolais or Roland, the royalists in
</p>
<p>calculating on Moreau found themselves deceived. Of this they
</p>
<p>were convmced from the very first attempts to discover his senti*
</p>
<p>ments. From his reception of the insinuations of Pichegru, they
</p>
<p>had rejected every idea that, should we unhappily lose our pilot
</p>
<p>[ 38 ]
</p>
<p>and the storm again return, they could derive any aid ffoiA hini^
</p>
<p>We are informed that Pichegru, perceiving this invincible resolu-
</p>
<p>tion in his political conversation with Moreau, and not being able
</p>
<p>to account for it on any other principle than that of personal ambi-
</p>
<p>tion, exclaimed in a moment of extreme discontent  I see that that
</p>
<p>b . . . , . has sufficient ambition. Roland bore a confirmation of this
</p>
<p>sentiment from his conference the next day.
</p>
<p>Let us here pause for a moment.
</p>
<p>Since, as it appears, Moreau neither wished the success of the
</p>
<p>Bourbons nor of the royalists, it is thence evident  -That he could
</p>
<p>not have been their accomplice : That he made no proposals to
</p>
<p>them in London ;  That he never promised them his support :  ^
</p>
<p>That he did not invite them to enter France :-r-That his plotting
</p>
<p>*with Pichegru is imaginary:  -That the mission pf Lajolais must
</p>
<p>be a fable r^-r-That his concerting with Georges must be a calumny:
</p>
<p>That, in a word, whatever may be the offences of Moreau to-
</p>
<p>wards the government, there is a real, palpable, and monstrous ab-
</p>
<p>surdity, in bringing him to judgment as a conspirator with the
</p>
<p>royalists.
</p>
<p>But whence the necessity of a train of reasoning to prove that a
</p>
<p>man did not plot the ruin of his own fame ? If the name of Moreau
</p>
<p>is celebrated in Europe, it has become so by the disasters of the
</p>
<p>house of Bourbon : by victories acquired over its allies and pro*
</p>
<p>tectors : by its present disgrace, which makes it every way impro-
</p>
<p>bable, that it should ever again be restored to power ! Yet do not
</p>
<p>those tremble at the baseness of the charge, who suppose that Mo-
</p>
<p>reau wished its return to France ! What honour, what recom-
</p>
<p>pense, could he thence derive ? Then indeed might he expect to
</p>
<p>be reproached and arraigned as a traitor. Then would he himself
</p>
<p>be obliged to bury all his trophies, and never again to recall any of
</p>
<p>his glorious military achievements; which, from the moment of
</p>
<p>its re-establishment, would be declared rebellion, and must mark
</p>
<p>him out as the most distinguished of rebels !
</p>
<p>Yet of what else is general Moreau accused ? He casts his eyes

<p>around him, .on those crowded and fatal benches ; whont does he
</p>
<p>there perceive ? Far be it from his intention to insult their misfor-
</p>
<p>tunes ; through the struggles in which we have been involved, the
</p>
<p>lot of preserving a pure character has fallen to very few ; yet he
</p>
<p>cannot refrain from observing, that there he does not perceive
</p>
<p>one republican, one soldier, with whom he everheld-a communi?
</p>
<p>on of conduct or sentiment. He beholds only determined royal-
</p>
<p>ists, who have, with a fanatick and unbroken faith, continued their
</p>
<p>attachment to their party. He looks for his accomplices and meet.s
</p>
<p>only adversaries and enemies. He is the only republican who
</p>
<p>there occupies a seat ; nor dare one of those on either side claim
</p>
<p>him tis their associate, AH that any of them has ventured to say^
</p>
<p>[ 89 ]
</p>
<p>is that he wished them to enter into his personal resentmerits ^ lnd
</p>
<p>to abandon their own cause to promote his.
</p>
<p>And who even thus far accuses him ? Roland ! Where are the
</p>
<p>proofs to support the charge ?  In the word of Roland ! How is
</p>
<p>Moreau known to be a conspirator?  By a conversation !  What
</p>
<p>accomplices, what partizans did he name ?  None !  Have none
</p>
<p>of those with whom he plotted been discovered ?  None !  All his
</p>
<p>domesticks, and many of his friends, have been arrested ; have
</p>
<p>pone of those suffered the secret to escape ?  None !  All his pa-
</p>
<p>pers have been seized ; have none of those betrayed the features
</p>
<p>of this plot ?-r-None !  Indeed ! What, then, is the nature of this
</p>
<p>very wonderful conspiracy, without associates, without witnesses,
</p>
<p>without evidence, without support, and, more than all, without
</p>
<p>conspirators ? rrLearn from Roland !
</p>
<p>Roland says that Pichegru, who intrigued for the royalists, not
</p>
<p>having been permitted to explain himself to Moreau, at their last
</p>
<p>interview, and seeing all his insinuations disregarded or repulsed,
</p>
<p>sent Roland to make the famous overture (we use his own words).
</p>
<p>It had not been previously made ; and, consequently, at this time
</p>
<p>Moreau had not been associated in their plans, as their confidence
</p>
<p>had not then been given to him. Roland adds that he made his
</p>
<p>proposition, and that Moreau absolutely refused to take part in any
</p>
<p>movement in behalf of the Bourbons. Moreau, therefore, is not
</p>
<p>guilty of any conspiracy whose object was the^r restoration. Ro-.
</p>
<p>land goes on to say, that, at the same time, Moreau proposed that
</p>
<p>IPichegru should change his plan, that he should first remove the
</p>
<p>consul and the governour of Paris, and then he, Moreau, wouldavail
</p>
<p>himself of a party in the senate to obtain the dictatorship, and
</p>
<p>would act according as opinion should direct,
</p>
<p>Roland at the trial, when pressed by his conscience, though he
</p>
<p>let one part of his former testimony remainV rescinded others.
</p>
<p>He there said that he did not understand the words the consuls and
</p>
<p>the governour of Paris must disappear^ as signifying a desire that
</p>
<p>they should be murdered j that Moreau speaking to him, on his

<p>pretensions to power or authority, had said, that before he could
</p>
<p>receive it, the consuls and all those possessed of publick dignity
</p>
<p>must be no more. Judge now what credit should be given to a
</p>
<p>witness who is capable of varying his testimony on a point of such
</p>
<p>importance : and on what tenure do our best citizens hold their
</p>
<p>lives and honour, if they depend upon the construction which eve-
</p>
<p>ry wretch shall please to alSx to a real or imagined conversation.
</p>
<p>A conversation ! The very idea that a conversation, however,
</p>
<p>seditious it may be, could constitute the crime of high-treason, is
</p>
<p>repugnant to every principle of justice. Moreau is not reproached
</p>
<p>with havmg performed one single treasonable act. His conduct is
</p>
<p>ftt least pare, whatever his heart may be. He has taken no steps,
</p>
<p>[ 40 ]
</p>
<p>deduced none to be his accomplices, in this supposed plot. But,
</p>
<p>as we are assured by Roland, he spoke seditiously ; and we are
</p>
<p>to believe that Roland neither heard indistinctly, misapprehended^
</p>
<p>nor forgot, any^ part of what Moreau may have said. Is the me-
</p>
<p>memory of anv man so rigidly tenacious as to be positive, aftey
</p>
<p>such a lapse of time, that such and such words were used in a con-
</p>
<p>versation ; that thev were used in the same order in which they
</p>
<p>are repeated ; that no modification, no inflexion, no accompanying
</p>
<p>lenitive, by escaping from recollection has distorted the meaning
</p>
<p>of the speaker. And, admitting them to have been spoken, shall
</p>
<p>the utterance of mere fugitive words send a man to the scaffold?
</p>
<p>No! the government under which we live, delighting only in
</p>
<p>justice, never can permit such a wide departure from it. No !
</p>
<p>never, under this government, shall we hear of a citizen being
</p>
<p>condemned for the crime of words, on the unsupported word of a
</p>
<p>delator. But when this delator, besides being proved by the ac-
</p>
<p>cused to be a liar, is, according to every rule of judgment, a vile
</p>
<p>calumniator, the object of his calumny is much less exposed. We
</p>
<p>shall now out of his own mouth prove the falsehoods of Roland.
</p>
<p>If we believe this Roland, he Was the agent of a party of royal-
</p>
<p>ists. If from him Moreau received the confidence of Pichegru,
</p>
<p>he must have known that Pichegru acted in concert Avith Georges
</p>
<p>and his friends ; that is to say, in concert with the most resolved
</p>
<p>and faithful adherents of the house of Bourbon. And we are told
</p>
<p>that Moreau, in answer to the overtures made to him, whether by
</p>
<p>Roland or Pichegru, gave such a reply as this.  " I never will
</p>
<p>*' serve the princes of Bourbon* But let the royalists immediate-
</p>
<p>" ly proceed to execute their design. I will not mix in the broil.
</p>
<p>" I will wait its success. Let them kill the Consul and the Go-

<p>" by, when every obstacle shall have been surmounted, when the

<p>Roland offends still more against the laws of common sense than
</p>
<p>against those of truth, and cannot be believed in any of his decla-
</p>
<p>rations. In the shdck-of the two voices, that of the accused ought
</p>
<p>i ^ :3
</p>
<p>to prevail, were it only because the testimony of Roland has vari-
</p>
<p>ed at different times.
</p>
<p>Another of his impositions is the declaration that Moreau boast-
</p>
<p>ed of a strong party in the Senate. Without noticing the injury
</p>
<p>he:|re done to the first constitutional feody in the state, we should
</p>
<p>deinand, if this were so, why do we not at this moment behold
</p>
<p>any^ of those unfaithful senators at the bar of this tribunal.
</p>
<p>B^t, we are asked, what interest could induce Roland to give
</p>
<p>false testimony ?
</p>
<p>^ The interest of Roland may be two-fold. In the first place it
</p>
<p>jnay be none other than that of a vile informer, who has denounced
</p>
<p>a fictitious crime to merit a substantial recompense. This suppo-
</p>
<p>sition will not appear unfounded, when we consider the species of
</p>
<p>complaisance which has been peculiarly shewn to him. All the
</p>
<p>other prisoners have been thrown into the cells of the Temple. He
</p>
<p>only, the systematick agent for corrupting Moreau and by conse-
</p>
<p>quence doubly offending, was lodged in the abbey. He only was
</p>
<p>allowed his counsel, and a free communication with his friends,
</p>
<p>both personally and by letters ; while neither the voice of a friend,
</p>
<p>nor the sigh of a relative, was permitted to penetrate the secret
</p>
<p>dungeons which almost excluded the others from the light of hea-
</p>
<p>ven.
</p>
<p>But if this supposition is erroneous, if he be really a conspirator^
</p>
<p>his interest may be of a different nature, but not less powerful ;
</p>
<p>that of appeasing the violated majesty, and disarming the awful
</p>
<p>severity, of the law, by becoming a general informer. In one of the
</p>
<p>interrogatories, on his first examination, an idea of clemency was
</p>
<p>held out to him, and a distinction taken which would greatly soften
</p>
<p>his fate  -If you declare nothings say the ministers of justice to
</p>
<p>him, you xoill be looked upon as an accomvi.ice^- if you divulge
</p>
<p>the whole, you -will be considered merely as a confident.  What
</p>
<p>more was necessary to inspire a base and cowardly spirit with the
</p>
<p>hopes of saving himself at the expense of others ? to testify false-
</p>
<p>hoods where he knew the truth would not attain his purposes ?

</p>
<p>Roland is not only under accusation as an accomplice in the
</p>
<p>same crime, but he is fairly suspected of interested and sinister
</p>
<p>motives ; his evidence therefore ought not to be believed.
</p>
<p>He ought not to be believed, because his assertions are unsup-
</p>
<p>ported by any other authority or circumstance.
</p>
<p>He ought not to be believed, because probability and common-
</p>
<p>sense, in every instance, contradict his testiinony.
</p>
<p>He ought not to be believed, because fugitive words are too sus-
</p>
<p>ceptible of variation, for any one to be able to declare, with cer-
</p>
<p>tainty, that they have been delivered in the order reported, or
</p>
<p>with the arbitrary meaning attached to them.
</p>
<p>Consequently, all the proof of the conspiracy which Moreau is
</p>
<p>[ 42 3
</p>
<p>tharged with having contrived or approved, being found in the so-
</p>
<p>litary declaration of one in the predicament of Roland, Moreau
</p>
<p>ought to be absolved.!
</p>
<p>FIFTH CHARGE.
</p>
<p>MOREAU DID NOT DENOUNCE THE CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>Before a crime can be denounced, it is necessary that he froni
</p>
<p>whom the denunciation is expected, should be acquainted with
</p>
<p>all the facts which constitute it, the object intended by it, the
</p>
<p>means employed or ready to be employed to promote it, and the
</p>
<p>names of those who are to concur in the execution of it*
</p>
<p>The law punishes him as a libeller who denounces without
</p>
<p>proof, who cannot establish the offence which he alleges, who
</p>
<p>cannot ascertain the guilt of him whom he accuses*
</p>
<p>He who is to denounce is consequeully a judge of the offence
</p>
<p>which the law invites him to discover.
</p>
<p>If the offence is not manifest, if its circumstances are suspected
</p>
<p>but not ascertained, society can exact nothing concerning it frm
</p>
<p>the civism of its members.
</p>
<p>The question in the present case concerns a powerful conspiiacy
</p>
<p>against the state.
</p>
<p>Such a conspiracy cannot be said to exist until a number of indi-
</p>
<p>viduals have combined, and have communicated to each other
</p>
<p>their ideas, their hopes, and their wishes ; until they have diges-
</p>
<p>ted some plan for the execution of which each pledges himself to
</p>
<p>the whole ; in which each has his particular duty assigned him, so
</p>
<p>that their separate efforts may tend to one common issue ; in
</p>
<p>which every thing is organized, from the chief who directs, to the
</p>
<p>most subordinate agent who is to execute his orders, and obey his
</p>
<p>instructions.
</p>
<p>Generel Moreau had no knowledge of such a conspiracy. He
</p>
<p>had seen Pichegru and Roland. There was no witness of the con-
</p>
<p>versations between him and the former ; but he has sufficiently
</p>
<p>established the insignificance of the first. All we can learn from
</p>
<p>the second, is, that Pichegru may have wished, provided certain

</p>
<p>events not likely to happen should occur, to replace the ancient
</p>
<p>family of the Bourbons on the throne of France.
</p>
<p>But if he had formed a plan, had engaged associates, and was
</p>
<p>furnished with means, these he necessarily concealed when he
</p>
<p>discovered, on the very first hint, that Moreau'^s affections were
</p>
<p>so completely alienated from that family, that he refused to hear
</p>
<p>that there was even a possibility of their return to France. This
</p>
<p>vague insinuation, then, was all that Moreau knew of such a pro-
</p>
<p>ject, and knew thus much only to laugh at it as ridiculous and ex-
</p>
<p>travagant.
</p>
<p>[ 43 ]
</p>
<p>Roland, even Roland confesses that on the 17th Pltiviose he did
</p>
<p>not disclose more : he does not say that any plan of conspiracy
</p>
<p>Vfa.s confided to Moreau.
</p>
<p>If thus ill instructed, and not wishing, not having the power, to
</p>
<p>be more minutely informed, Moreau had stepped forward as an
</p>
<p>accuser, what would have been the consequence ? Pichegru would
</p>
<p>either have escaped from Paris, or he would have been apprehend-
</p>
<p>ed. In the first case the denunciation would have been ineffectual,
</p>
<p>and he would have been again censured as the tardy discoverer of
</p>
<p>the enemy of the state ; in the second, Pichegru, denying every
</p>
<p>thing, and nothing being found to support the charge against him,
</p>
<p>then Moreau, failmg in the proof of what he had alleged, would,
</p>
<p>in the contemplation of law, have been branded as a libeller.
</p>
<p>Let us by way of hypothesis, although allowing a scope for rea-
</p>
<p>soning which cannot be e3<acted from us, enlarge for a moment
</p>
<p>the sphere of the intelligence communicated to Moreau, and sup-
</p>
<p>pose thathe w^as itfade fully acquainted with the complete organi-
</p>
<p>zation of a conspiracy, and knew the approaching moment ap-
</p>
<p>pointed for its execution. Then, you will no doubt say, Moreau
</p>
<p>would have failed in the duty which society imposes on each of. its
</p>
<p>members, had he not immediately discovered to the constituted
</p>
<p>authorities, the gulph that was yawning for their destruction^
</p>
<p>His silence might have shewn him to be a careless citizen ; but
</p>
<p>would he have been a criminal for whom the law reserved a chas-
</p>
<p>tisement ? ^No.
</p>
<p>We refer to the Penal Code of the 2lst of September 1791 ; we
</p>
<p>open the Code of Crimes and Punishments of the 3d Brumaire
</p>
<p>year 4; and in the multiplied series of punishments reserved for each
</p>
<p>species of offence or crime, we find nothing which ranks this
</p>
<p>amongst the acts of conspiracy, consequently nothing that can pu-
</p>
<p>nish it as such. The not revealing a crime within your knowledge,
</p>
<p>whatever may be its nature, receives there no qualification, has
</p>
<p>there no place assigned to it.
</p>
<p>Yet these two laws constitute the whole of our penal legislation.

<p>Since their promulgation nothing has been known as a crime but
</p>
<p>what has been rendered such by some overt act. And every ac-
</p>
<p>tion which is not there defined, can but receive publick reprehen-
</p>
<p>sion. Opinion may condemn but the law has no power to judge it
</p>
<p>Nor is it of any consequence though some ancient law may have
</p>
<p>given to an act the character of a crime ; if the new code, more in-
</p>
<p>dulgent and more wise, has not particularly declared it to be so the
</p>
<p>act is no longer criminal.
</p>
<p>Such is the dictum of our penal code.
</p>
<p>If the act rendered criminal by the ancient statutes, is recogniz-
</p>
<p>ed by the present code, the accused who shall be found guilty of
</p>
<p>it, shall suffer the penalties of the present code ; which has, in
</p>
<p>G
</p>
<p>[ 44 ]
</p>
<p>express terms, declared that all crimes indicated by anteriour laws,
</p>
<p>and not therein renewed in that sense, shall cease to be such.
</p>
<p>Or, which is perfectly synonymous, or even more simple, as
</p>
<p>cited above, there can be no other crimes nor punishments than
</p>
<p>those expressly designated by the present code  And, consequent-
</p>
<p>ly, by not permitting any punishment except such as it has ap-
</p>
<p>pointed, it abrogates all those which may have been known before
</p>
<p>it existed,
</p>
<p>To turn over a single folio of the ancient statutes, with a view to
</p>
<p>discover a law which inflicts on those who do not denounce a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, the same penalties incurred by the conspirator, is, there-
</p>
<p>fore, inadmissible.
</p>
<p>We know perfectly well that such law vf as enacted, in 1477, by
</p>
<p>Louis XI, the most suspicious ofthe Kings of France.
</p>
<p>We also know that Cardinal Richelieu availed himself of thiis
</p>
<p>law in order to gratify his revenge in the process against the un-
</p>
<p>fortunate De Thou : a process which, in recalling the execrated
</p>
<p>name of Laubardemont, recalls also the long train of hoiTOurs of
</p>
<p>which he was the minister.
</p>
<p>But of what consequence is such a law, long since, after one so-
</p>
<p>litary application, buried in oblivion. Never was it restored, ne-
</p>
<p>ver confirmed, bj^any successor of Louis XI, 
</p>
<p>Neither the celebrated ordinance of 1539, fabricated by the
</p>
<p>chancellor Puget, for the sole purpose of compassrng the death of
</p>
<p>admiral Chabot ; nor the ordinance of Orleans and of Blois ; nor
</p>
<p>any other ordinance subsequent to 1477, are disgraced by a simi-
</p>
<p>lar provision.
</p>
<p>We should not at this time possess a special legislation, em-
</p>
<p>bracing every case, and authorising no other punishments than
</p>
<p>those v/hich it provides, had it not been from the fear that-, under
</p>
<p>a government whose lav^s were established upon the dispositions,
</p>
<p>and adapted to the manners of the people, and which had given a
</p>
<p>civil code to France, some chance might have renewed the power
</p>
<p>of a sanguinary edict, which the neglect of centuries had senten-

<p>ced to an eternal silence, and whose single application has been
</p>
<p>pursued by the execration of posterity. The revival of such au-
</p>
<p>thority, it was justly perceived, would have been disgraceful to

<p>the reign of Libert}'' and the Empire of law.

<p>In not denouncing the conspiracy even had he known its ex-

<p>istence, general Moreau would not hav^ offended against any law,
</p>
<p>and consequently would have incurred no penalty. As it was un*
</p>
<p>known to him that such a plot di^ exist, to denounce it was
</p>
<p>impossible, and to punish him for ignorance would be unjust and
</p>
<p>impolitick.
</p>
<p>In terminating this melancholy task we may be perniitted to re-
</p>
<p>turn to one part of the accusation, and to discharge ourselves of a
</p>
<p>[ 45 ]
</p>
<p>burthen that has pressed heavily upon our heart, from the first
</p>
<p>moment when this defence engaged our attention.
</p>
<p>Moreau is accused of having aimed at possessing the supreme
</p>
<p>power ; of having plotted against the life of the emperour !
</p>
<p>No : by honour and by fame we swear, Moreau cannot be
</p>
<p>guilty I He knew too well the horrours of a revolution ever to be
</p>
<p>himself the author of a new one ! He knew that blind, devouring,
</p>
<p>and remorseless, monster ; which, while he was shedding on his
</p>
<p>country glory and renown, at the moment when victory was
</p>
<p>crowning him on the field of battle, brought under the guillotine
</p>
<p>the head of his venerable father ! No : Moreau never could de-
</p>
<p>sire the ruin of that country, in which, as long as it exists, his
</p>
<p>name can never be pronounced but with praise and gratitude ! He
</p>
<p>who never discovered the most latent spark of ambition when pos-
</p>
<p>sessed of the power of gratifying it, cannot be supposed to entertain
</p>
<p>the desire of rule now, when deprived of all the means of accom-
</p>
<p>plishing his views ! He who never harboured a jealous thought
</p>
<p>against those rivals whom a weak and mistaken government prefer-
</p>
<p>red to command over him, could not envy the rank of that privi-
</p>
<p>leged genius whom providence seems to have peculiarly designed
</p>
<p>t-o be the regulator of impires ; under whom every place is a place
</p>
<p>of splendour! whilst all the nations and sovereigns of Europe sue
</p>
<p>for the alliance of Buonaparte, can it be supposed that an idea of
</p>
<p>displacing him could enter the mind of a man, who, whatever may
</p>
<p>have been his opinion of the form of government, has incontesti-
</p>
<p>bly proved, during twelve years, his unobstruive obedience to the
</p>
<p>national will ! He who yielded implicitly to the command of Sche-
</p>
<p>rer, of Joubert, and of Macdonald, could never consider himself
</p>
<p>disgraced by submitting to their chief.
</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPT.
</p>
<p>Many arguments: which would of themselves, remove far from
</p>
<p>general Moreau all ground of accusation, have been omitted. We
</p>
<p>v/ill here enumerate one or two of those.
</p>
<p>We have already made apparent, in the memoir and in the plead-

<p>ings, the perfect inoffensiveness of the relations between Moreau
</p>
<p>and the Abbe David : their connexion is fully justified in the let-
</p>
<p>ter written by the former to the latter. We have explained the
</p>
<p>conduct of the general on the occurrences preceding the 18th
</p>
<p>Fructidor. We have brought into view his sentiments on the con-
</p>
<p>i^uct of Pichegru, in remaining among the enemies of France dur-
</p>
<p>ing the three last campaigns: and his subsequent generous decla-
</p>
<p>ration that so far from his being an obstacle to the return of Piche-
</p>
<p>gru, he would gladly co-operate in obtaining his full pardon, so far
</p>
<p>as his aid could be serviceable.
</p>
<p>The eyes of those must be shut against light who refuse to
</p>
<p>[ 46 ]
</p>
<p>be convinced that in all this there is nothing participating in the
</p>
<p>nature of a conspiracy : but on the contrary the true characterise
</p>
<p>ticks of a good man ; attachment and love of his country, compass
</p>
<p>sion and friendship for the unhappy.
</p>
<p>But the innocence of these relations has been still more clearly-
</p>
<p>demonstrated, by the declaration of David, who says that he ex-
</p>
<p>plained his intention of reconciling Moreau and Pichegru, and of
</p>
<p>obtaining, if possible, liberty for the latter to return to France, to
</p>
<p>several distinguished generals and citizens, who are far out of the
</p>
<p>reach of suspicion, and that he proceeded by their advice ; and by
</p>
<p>its being proved that the words, " if you could bring me but one
</p>
<p>." line from our friend, it would be a great pleasure to me," which
</p>
<p>are found in one of the letters from Pichegru to David, have no
</p>
<p>reference to Moreau, but to a Senator who authorised us to plead
</p>
<p>this fact in his name ; and to add that he sent the line desired by
</p>
<p>Pichegru, to his old companion in misfortune j his letter was
</p>
<p>found amongst the papers of David.
</p>
<p>Another, and more important point is that resting on the word
</p>
<p>of Roland : whose villanous imposture is evident in every part of
</p>
<p>that horrid design which he attributes to Moreau.
</p>
<p>The improbability, the palpable falsehood, the total impossibility
</p>
<p>of the fact, prove it to be the fabrication of Roland. But the loy-
</p>
<p>al and generous soul of Moreau has been so deeply wounded by
</p>
<p>the mere allegation, that we must, in his farther justification, ex-
</p>
<p>plain a circumstance barely touched upon in the memoir, and
</p>
<p>which must divest the testimony of Roland of all claim to belief.
</p>
<p>The interrogatory* which procured the reply of Roland contain-
</p>
<p>ing the words imputed to general Moreau, and the reply itself
</p>
<p>must be compared, in order to shew how naturally the one follows
</p>
<p>the other, and is derived from it : how impossible it was for Ro-
</p>
<p>land not to seize on a mean of safety which he believed he saw pre-
</p>
<p>sented to him 5 how very probable it is that Roland had in the first
</p>
<p>place ofiered to purchase that safety by atrociously vilifying Mo-
</p>
<p>reau.

</p>
<p>To a first question on the subject of a conference related by Pi-
</p>
<p>chegru to Roland, he replied, that " Some time had passed since
</p>
<p>" that conversation took place, and he could not be certain that his
</p>
<p>" memory had faithfully retained what was then said  he might
</p>
<p>" be deceived."
</p>
<p>Then follows an interrogatory which occupies three pages of the
</p>
<p>examination, in which he is told that every thing he had done and*
</p>
<p>said v/as known, that his conversations vv^ith Pichegru v/ere over-
</p>
<p>heard ; that his apartment -was so contrived that, notwithstanding
</p>
<p>every precaution, the secret had been betrayed ; it then concludes
</p>
<p>* E.xainination of Pvolar-d, 2Cth Pluviossj bsfore the Courxsellor of State, Real,-
</p>
<p>[47 ]
</p>
<p>in these words  " Beware, lest, in continuing silent, you conceal
</p>
<p>^' from the ear of Justice any one of the facts which she ought to
</p>
<p>" know, and thereby force us to believe that you are not merely
</p>
<p>" the confident but the accomplice oi those men whom she pursues.
</p>
<p>*' I invite you, then, to speak more ingenuously, and to discover
</p>
<p>*' not only all that Pichegru said to you, but all that passed between
</p>
<p>*' you and Moreau, at whose house it will be proved that you
</p>
<p>' were the second day after Pichegru came to lodge with you.
</p>
<p>" We heard you speak of this visit by the same means : you told
</p>
<p>" Pichegru that Moreau had a large party in the Senate ; that he,
</p>
<p>" Moreau, was at the head of a design against the first consul and
</p>
<p>" the governour of Paris, in which the Bourbons were interested.
</p>
<p>"  I summons you, therefore, to declare the whole truth, con-
</p>
<p>" cerning these conferences and the object connected with them.'*
</p>
<p>It was in reply to this question, thus concluded, that Roland,
</p>
<p>who a moment before feared that " he might be deceived," who
</p>
<p>apprehended " the infidelity of his memory," found all at once a
</p>
<p>perfect recollection, put to flight all silly scruples, and followed the
</p>
<p>path so ingeniously chalked out for him. It was then, that the
</p>
<p>hope of being considered only as a confident and not as an accom-
</p>
<p>plice, induced him to give birth to those nefarious falsehoods, and
</p>
<p>particularly to testify that Moreau had spoken of a strong party in
</p>
<p>the Senate, by which he could obtain the supreme power, but that
</p>
<p>:the first consul, &c. &c. must first disappear.
</p>
<p>Who does not immediately see in the correlation between this
</p>
<p>question and its answer, how destitute of credibility it leaves this
</p>
<p>frightful assertion of Roland, who until then had said nothing, but
</p>
<p>who from his intimacy with Pichegru, from having lodged him in
</p>
<p>i  his house, and from other circumstances, believing that he had
</p>
<p>" every thing to fear for himself, seized with alacrity on the hope
</p>
<p>held out to him in the question, of escaping punishment as an ac-
</p>
<p>cornplice. He had only to lie and be saved; it required but little de-
</p>
<p>liberation to decide. Independent, then, of his situation of co-
</p>
<p>accused, of his declaration being unsupported by any other proof,

</p>
<p>which alone would annul it, it is destroyed by the very means ta-
</p>
<p>ken to obtain it, by the predicament in which he was placed, and
</p>
<p>the hope that be might purchase his own life, by infamously and
</p>
<p>falsely swearing away the life and honour of another.
</p>
<p>Let us dive a little deeper. Who had previously disclosed the
</p>
<p>circumstances which appear in this interrogatory ?  It was either
</p>
<p>some other witness, or it was Roland himself.  If another, why
</p>
<p>has not that other been brought forward ? why was he not heard at
</p>
<p>the trial ?  If it was Roland, which is the most probable supposi-
</p>
<p>tion, then it is plain that he had basely trafficked his character for
</p>
<p>his life, in promising the disclosures which he pretended to make ;
</p>
<p>[48]
</p>
<p>and that he afterwards invented that salutary perjury, in which he
</p>
<p>had the courage to persevere.
</p>
<p>Any thing more would be superabundant. Roland only affirms
</p>
<p>to the charge : Moreau solemnly denies it.  Roland stands under a
</p>
<p>criminal accusation, and, according to every principle and every
</p>
<p>avithority, his evidence is inadmissible ; it can neither be allowed
</p>
<p>to prove, nor even to cause a suspicion of guilt.
</p>
<p>It has been said that Moreau wished to possess himself of power.
</p>
<p>His character, his habits of life, his total retirement from publick
</p>
<p>view, his being entirely unacquainted with men in place, the cir-
</p>
<p>cumstance that not one person with whom he has any intimacy has
</p>
<p>been accused, and the difficulty of believing that he could hope to
</p>
<p>obtain it by the assistance of the Bourbons, or their fanatick parti-
</p>
<p>zans, all unite to annihilate this absurd charge.
</p>
<p>Where now is that man, tn whose breast there is either
</p>
<p>JUSTICE or impartiality, WHO CAN RESIST SUCH CLEAR DEMON-
</p>
<p>STRATIONS OF INNOCENCE ? WHO CAN NOW LAY HIS HAND ON HIS
</p>
<p>HE4iRT AND SAY GENERAL MoREAU IS GUILTY I
