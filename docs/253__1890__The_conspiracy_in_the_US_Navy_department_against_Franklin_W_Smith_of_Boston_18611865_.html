</p>
<p>Commerce," January 20th, 1866.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Franklin W. Smith is a well-known merchant of
</p>
<p>the city of Boston. Boston is the principal city of Massa-
</p>
<p>chusetts. Massachusetts is the principal State of New-
</p>
<p>England. New England governs the United States for the
</p>
<p>present. The United States compose a country distin-
</p>

</p>
<p>principles. This is the 19th century.

<p>the subject of this article.

</p>
<p>being the report of a special committee of the Boston Board
</p>
<p>of Trade, which vouches for the truth of the story it con-

<p>tains. The statements in the pamphlet are signed by the

<p>following names : W. B. Spooner, Charles G. Nazro,
</p>
<p>Charles O. Whitmore, Otis Norcross, James C. Converse,

<p>LETTER FROM HON. H. L. DAWES
</p>
<p>U. S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS,
</p>
<p>TO
</p>
<p>krank:IvIN w. sniixh.
</p>
<p>PiTTSFiELD, Mass., August 20, 1889.
</p>
<p>My Dear Sir: I am in receipt of your communication
</p>
<p>in reference to the court-martial proceedings instituted
</p>
<p>against you during the war. I am reminded by it of a
</p>
<p>long delayed duty. Of those to whom your long and
</p>
<p>honorable career as a business man is known ; who were
</p>
<p>familiar at the time with that transaction, and had occasion
</p>
<p>and opportunity to know its animus, few are now living.
</p>
<p>I was in Congress at the time, and with my then colleagues,
</p>
<p>was called upon to make myself familiar with all its details,
</p>
<p>and with the result most honorable to you. I have won-
</p>
<p>dered that you have not published to the world the entire
</p>
<p>record, with Mr. Lincoln's endorsement upon it, in his own
</p>
<p>hand-writing, of his estimate of your integrity and his
</p>
<p>trenchant words dismissing the case.
</p>
<p>I write this because, those who instituted the proceed-
</p>
<p>ing, and the great President who condemned it, .and
</p>
<p>those of my colleagues, who with me specially ex-
</p>
<p>amined it, are all dead. I think I ought to leave on
</p>
<p>record the opinion which I then formed, after an ex-
</p>
<p>haustive examination, and in which I know the entire
</p>
<p>Massachusetts delegation in Congress at the time shared,
</p>
<p>of the outrageous and unjust character of the whole pro-
</p>

<p>3
</p>
<p>ceeding. This examination was made by Mr. Sumner
</p>
<p>and the late Hon. B. F. Thomas and myself for the dele-
</p>
<p>gation.
</p>
<p>It is true that in the exciting times of the war, when
</p>
<p>large transactions were often from necessity carried on in a
</p>
<p>hurried and careless manner, and when bad passions were
</p>
<p>rife and ugly purposes were engendered, a prosecution by
</p>
<p>court-martial was instituted against you ; at the time a
</p>
<p>large contractor for supplies for the navy. Courts-martial
</p>
<p>were then so frequent and resorted to so often for sinister
</p>
<p>ends that it came to be a saying that " courts-martial are
</p>
<p>organized to convict." This one conducted the trial in a
</p>
<p>manner and with a relentless pursuit which, looked at from
</p>
<p>the standpoint of these calm times, would be pronounced
</p>
<p>brutal by all fair-minded men.
</p>
<p>It not only seized the accused by military force but
</p>
<p>entered his private dwelling and carried off all his private
</p>
<p>as well as business papers, even breaking locks and pos-
</p>
<p>sessing itself of the letters that had passed between him
</p>
<p>and his wife. It examined, as with a microscope, every
</p>
<p>item of a business with the government, covering several
</p>
<p>years and twelve hundred thousand dollars, searching for
</p>
<p>fraud as a hunter pursues his game, and after months of
</p>
<p>such a trial of such varied and complicated transactions,
</p>
<p>they could only find, and that on technical grounds, that
</p>
<p>the government had been defrauded in the sum of one
</p>
<p>hundred dollars. When this record came up to Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln for approval, he set it all aside in words endorsed
</p>
<p>on its back, which carry with them the highest testimonials
</p>
<p>to your integrity. The result made it clear to every
</p>
<p>judicial mind which examined it, that the prosecution was
</p>
<p>instigated and pressed, because your straightforward ways
</p>
<p>interfered with questionable methods of transacting busi-
</p>
<p>ness, and their success rendered your removal necessary.
</p>
<p>I have good reason to know that Secretary Welles himself

</p>
<p>became convinced of this, and deeply regretted that he had
</p>
<p>unwittingly been made the instrument of such injustice.
</p>
<p>I am glad of the opportunity to furnish you with this
</p>
<p>statement, and remain as ever, Truly yours,
</p>
<p>H. L. Dawes.
</p>
<p>It is with pleasure that I respond to the suggestion of
</p>
<p>Senator Dawes, by this publication of a personal experi-
</p>
<p>ence during the War of the Rebellion  the full history
</p>
<p>of which was prepared more than twenty years ago to
</p>
<p>be issued in the event of my decease. Inasmuch as I
</p>
<p>have been mercifully spared to see the maturity of a new
</p>
<p>generation (while almost all of those who sought my
</p>
<p>destruction have been called to their final account), this
</p>
<p>recital becomes a duty, since few now living are cogni-
</p>
<p>zant of that case. It is therefore revived, in order that
</p>
<p>partial or erroneous statements relating thereto may be
</p>
<p>avoided ; as well as the grave responsibility attending
</p>
<p>the utterance of such statements.*
</p>
<p>In abnegation of personal feeling toward my perse-
</p>
<p>cutors ; burying bitter memories of them in their graves,
</p>
<p>1 suppress their names, and tell the story from official
</p>
<p>and public documents. These are indisputable, impar-
</p>
<p>tial and final.
</p>
<p>The report of the Boston Board of Trade in review of
</p>
<p>the case, and the paper of Senator Sumner to President
</p>
<p>Lincoln, quote a threatening letter from the chief of a
</p>
<p>Naval Bureau. It is known as " the-dead-cock-in-the-
</p>
<p>pit" letter. Vide p. 51 and Addenda III.
</p>
<p>The writer of the Report submitted to me whether
</p>
<p>the name of the author of the letter might be suppressed.
</p>
<p>I assented to the erasure  but with keen remembrance
</p>
<p>that he had aimed a deadly assault upon my own.
</p>
<p>The following statement is a slight compensation for
</p>
<p>* I am advised by eminent counsel that any distorted or injuri-
</p>
<p>ous mention of this history exposes the author to severe legal
</p>

</p>
<p>retribution,
</p>
<p>the injustice recited; for, while many may be conscious
</p>
<p>of integrity, there is no instance of its vindication against
</p>
<p>the war power and treasury of the National Govern-
</p>
<p>ment, wielded with like desperation and malignity.
</p>
<p>Personal satisfaction at the defeat of this onslaught is of
</p>
<p>slight importance compared to its public relations :
</p>
<p>First. Toward protection of witnesses summoned by Congress
</p>
<p>against the revenge of officials implicated by their testimony.
</p>
<p>Second. As a warning against the surrender of civilians to
</p>
<p>military power.
</p>
<p>The seriousness of the above considerations was
</p>
<p>recognized in consequent repeal by Congress of the law
</p>
<p>which permitted the outrage ; and it has given to the
</p>
<p>case of the U. S. Navy Department vs. Franklin W.
</p>
<p>Smith the historical status of a cause celebre.
</p>
<p>The Act of Congress of July 17, 1862, provides that
</p>
<p>" any person who shall contract to furnish supplies of
</p>
<p>any kind or description for the army or the navy, he
</p>
<p>shall be deemed and taken as a part of the land or naval
</p>
<p>forces of the United States, for which he shall contract
</p>
<p>to furnish said supplies, and be subject to the rules and
</p>
<p>regulations for the government of the land and naval
</p>
<p>forces of the United States."
</p>
<p>The Report of the Boston Board of Trade upon the
</p>
<p>case of Franklin W. Smith comments upon this legisla-
</p>
<p>tion as follows :
</p>
<p>"The committee quote the act of Congress and say, that
</p>
<p>upon the construction which has been given to it they do

</p>
<p>not see why every person who contracts to furnish a lump
</p>
<p>of chalk, for the use of the army or navy, is not Hable  on
</p>
<p>offence to some official personage  to a trial by court-
</p>
<p>martial, t- ^ >i<
</p>
<p>This is unconditionally monstrous. No trial by jury !' '
</p>
<p>*'*I will maintain as long as I live,' said Dupin, the
</p>
<p>great French advocate, ' that the condemnation of Marshal
</p>
<p>Ney was not just, for his defence was not free.' Can there
</p>
<p>ever be a /-ree defence for a civilian arraigned under the act
</p>
<p>of July 17, 1862?
</p>
<p>*' We have read that Niceron, a merchant, and the agent
</p>
<p>of commercial companies in Paris, was committed to the
</p>
<p>Bastile simply for remonstrating against a projected
</p>
<p>monopoly in the article of whale oil ; so, too, we have read
</p>
<p>that the Star Chamber imposed a fine of ;^2,ooo, sterling
</p>
<p>money of the realm, on Chambers, a merchant of London,
</p>
<p>for refusing to pay poundage and tonnage, and for saying
</p>
<p>that ' merchants were more screwed up and wronged in
</p>
<p>England than in Turkey.'
</p>
<p>" The sixteenth section of the act of Congress of July 17,
</p>
<p>1862, as relates to a class of citizens in civil life, revives the
</p>
<p>Bastile and the Star Chamber. Nay, more ; overleaping
</p>
<p>eighteen centuries of Christian civiHzation at a single
</p>
<p>bound, goes back to heathen Rome and revives maxims of
</p>
<p>Caesar, that * arms and laws do not flourish .together ; '
</p>
<p>that ' war will not bear much liberty of speech. '
</p>
<p>** We measure our words ; for, aside from our own repu-
</p>
<p>tation, this Report, if accepted, will become the judgment
</p>
<p>of this Board, and a part of the commercial history of
</p>
<p>Boston. We measure our words. Seldom in legislation
</p>
<p>has there been a more terrible, a more appalling mistake,
</p>
<p>and the very member of Congress who reported it in bill
</p>
<p>to the House, magnanimously owns it now, and, on the
</p>
<p>second day of March, 1865, stood up in his place and con-
</p>
<p>fessed his error."

</p>
<p>the prosecution of Smith Brothers, under the above law,
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>Hon. John P. Hale, Senator from New Hampshire, spoke
</p>
<p>as follows :
</p>
<p>" Sir, it is impossible for me to scan the motives of men ;
</p>
<p>it is enough for me to deal with my own ; but, standing
</p>
<p>here under all the responsibilities which attach to me 
</p>
<p>fond as any man of what little reputation belongs to me 
</p>
<p>careful of my word, I think, as most men  I aver before
</p>
<p>the Senate, before the country and before God, that I have
</p>
<p>not a shadow of doubt that the sole oifense for which Mr.
</p>
<p>Smith was arrested was the evidence that he gave upon the
</p>
<p>occasion."
</p>
<p>In a subsequent debate, March, 1865, Hon. H. L.
</p>
<p>Dawes, of Massachusetts, upon the same subject, said :
</p>
<p>*' I do not say why this unjustifiable course was pursued
</p>
<p>toward these men. I only say that it happened immedi-
</p>
<p>ately after they had testified before an investigating com-
</p>
<p>mittee of Congress, in reference to certain frauds that had
</p>
<p>come to their knowledge, very near the doors of certaiti
</p>
<p>naval officials. Now, sir, I submit that it is time for us to
</p>
<p>act."
</p>
<p>Mr. Davis, of Maryland, moved as follows :
</p>
<p>" That no person shall be tried by court-martial, or mili-
</p>
<p>tary commission, in any State or Territory where the
</p>
<p>courts of the United States are open, except persons actu-
</p>
<p>ally mustered in the military or naval service of the United
</p>
<p>States, or rebel enemies charged with being spies ; and all

</p>
<p>voted myself to the effort to ferret out and punish those
</p>
<p>who have been engaged in defrauding the Government."
</p>
<p>**In carrying out what I was endeavoring to do, I, in
</p>
<p>co-operation with others, reported to the House a bill which
</p>
<p>became a law, making contractors with the Government
</p>
<p>subject to trial by court-martial. I was aware that it was
</p>
<p>an extreme measure. In putting into the hands of the
</p>
<p>officers of the Government this extreme power, I had confi-
</p>
<p>dence that they would exercise it with moderation and
</p>
<p>reason. But, Mr. Chairman, I am sorry to say, that my
</p>
<p>observation of the administration of that law, of which I
</p>
<p>take to myself some part of the responsibility, has been
</p>
<p>such during the past year or two as to compel me to sup-
</p>
<p>port this amendment. Sir, we seem to have lost sight, in
</p>
<p>the execution of that law, of the guarantees of the Consti-
</p>
<p>tution.

</p>

</p>
<p>turned so much upon the people of the Northern States,
</p>
<p>and so administered as to become the potent instrument for
</p>
<p>trampHng upon the rights of the citizens, that I have ven-
</p>
<p>tured to raise a protest against the very Bill I reported
</p>
<p>myself, that has been perverted from the honest use for
</p>
<p>which it was enacted by the last Congress of the United

<p>States, and to ask the House to do this much and this little
</p>
<p>for the protection of our citizens."

</p>
<p>in the House of Representatives as an argument for the
</p>
<p>total repeal of the act of Congress authorizing the trial of
</p>
<p>civilians by courts-martial. Such a case as this must make

<p>us fear, that under this act, justice may be sacrificed. It
</p>
<p>must make honest merchants hesitate to enter into business

<p>Reform of the Old Contract System Through the Effort
</p>
<p>of F. W. Smith.
</p>
<p>Upon the election of Abraham Lincoln to the Presi-
</p>
<p>dency of the United States, the hardware house of Smith
</p>
<p>Brothers & Co. made their first tenders for supplies to
</p>
<p>the Navy Department.
</p>
<p>On the 24th of February, 1862, and before the fulfil-
</p>
<p>ment of their first contract, Mr. Franklin W. Smith
</p>
<p>addressed a printed paper to the Chief of the Bureau of
</p>
<p>Yards and Docks, in argument that the contract system
</p>
<p>as then existed, opened facilities for gross wrong upon
</p>
<p>the government. This paper, with others hereinafter
</p>
<p>mentioned, may be found in the Report of the Select
</p>
<p>Committee on Naval Supplies of the United States Sen-
</p>
<p>ate of July 4, 1864.
</p>
<p>The following extracts will indicate its tenor :
</p>
<p>** Having decided to attempt some government contracts
</p>
<p>we analyzed the published reports of the department iti
</p>
<p>previous years to discover the modus operandi. We were
</p>
<p>astonished that a system that left such records of bargain-
</p>
<p>ing could have been so long maintained.

<p>PAPER TO THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY
</p>
<p>AND HON. CHARLES B. SEDGWICK.
</p>
<p>Washington, February 10, 1863.
</p>
<p>The bill before the House proposes to remedy evils in
</p>
<p>the contract system of the Navy Department that have
</p>
<p>existed for many years. The disadvantages that have fol-
</p>
<p>lowed to the government have been inherent in the system
</p>
<p>itself. In two bureaus of the department a system of pro-
</p>
<p>posals by advertisement has been maintained, that in result
</p>
<p>was a mere matter of chance to the respective parties.
</p>
<p>Thus in the Bureau of Yards and Docks it has been custo-
</p>
<p>mary to advertise for a great variety of articles which were
</p>
<p>only to be called for if wa7ited. The chance, therefore, for
</p>
<p>the bidder to calculate upon is : What articles will be
</p>
<p>ivanted ?
</p>
<p>'K '1^ p 'f' '1^
</p>
<p>If the contracts of the department, as published for years
</p>
<p>past, be analyzed, it will be found that a system of bidding
</p>
<p>has been maintained by which the merchandise advertised
</p>
<p>has been offered to the government at very much less than
</p>
<p>its value in the market ; the bidders having calculated ac-
</p>
<p>cording to their estimate of the real wants of government.
</p>
<p>The law has required that the lowest bid, in aggregate

</p>
<p>upon the whole, should be accepted.
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>The merchant, therefore, who would approach the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment with his offer, must follow these old precedents or
</p>
<p>be entirely distanced by his competitors.
</p>
<p>Honorable mercantile houses have desired and urged a
</p>
<p>reform in the system that would place the transactions of
</p>
<p>the department upon a mere legitimate basis to all parties
</p>
<p>concerned.
</p>
<p>THE REMEDY.
</p>
<p>The bill reported by the committee is an advance
</p>
<p>towards remedying the evils of the system. In two of its
</p>
<p>provisions, however, in my judgment, it is defective :
</p>
<p>First. By providing that there may be an increase of
</p>
<p>fifty per ceyitimi or a decrease of twenty five per centum
</p>
<p>upon the quantities advertised ; the game of chance is still
</p>
<p>open.
</p>
<p>Let the Navy Department, as the War Department,
</p>
<p>advertise for precisely ivhat is to be received ; ?io inore, no
</p>
<p>less. There can then be no ''nominal prices." They will
</p>
<p>disappear ; for the merchant will know that the merchan-
</p>
<p>dise described is to be furnished. If the War Department
</p>
<p>wants 100 ambulances and 200 wagons, they contract for
</p>
<p>and demand like quantities as advertised. There is no
</p>
<p>chance to estimate that there may be dehvered, under the
</p>
<p>contract, 50 ambulances and 500 wagons. The War
</p>
<p>Department, therefore, receives no bids at "nominal
</p>
<p>prices."
</p>
<p>If the Navy Department is uncertain as to its want of
</p>
<p>some articles, let them be bought when the demand shall
</p>
<p>arise. It can buy in open market, or it can direct its agents
</p>
<p>to advertise, at any time, for one day, or one month, for
</p>
<p>any additional articles that may be demanded.
</p>
<p>If the schedules, as contracted for, are being rapidly ex-
</p>
<p>hausted, the department can, before the contracts expire,
</p>
<p>advertise for more merchandise, by the provision of the bill

</p>
<p>of the committee.
</p>
<p>Second. Having thus effectually removed all occasion or
</p>
<p>opportunity for nominal prices, the clause allowing the
</p>
<p>16
</p>
<p>rejection of bids for nominal prices can be omitted. It
</p>
<p>gives an opportunity for unfairness by an arbitrary decision,
</p>
<p>as to what is a nominal price. One merchant, perhaps, by
</p>
<p>unusual facilities possessed, may afford to supply articles
</p>
<p>less than any other parties. The government would suffer,
</p>
<p>and the merchant be wronged, if the bid were to be rejected
</p>
<p>because the price, appeared too cheap.
</p>
<p>The amendments to the resolution suggested by the
</p>
<p>above are :
</p>
<p>First. The omission of the clause allowing variations
</p>
<p>from the quantities advertised.
</p>
<p>Second. The omission of the clause allowing the rejec-
</p>
<p>tion of bids for nominal prices : because, if the quantities
</p>
<p>are fixed as above mentioned, there can be no nominal
</p>
<p>prices.

</p>
<p>My Dear Sir : I am glad to notice by the papers that
</p>
<p>the resolution concerning contracts was recommitted after
</p>
<p>debate, as I feared my suggestions were too late.
</p>
<p>We have really no pecuniary interest in the amendments
</p>
<p>suggested ; for it is impossible to estimate whether the bill
</p>
<p>with or without them will be most favorable to our profit,
</p>
<p>if we make further contracts. My motive in the effort
</p>
<p>made was, sincerely : Jirst, for the good of the government ;
</p>
<p>second, that it might appear that all merchants who became
</p>
<p>contractors were not inevitably, because in business con-
</p>
<p>nections with the government  selfish sharpers.
</p>
<p>The record we have made to date is a clear one ; we are

</p>
<p>content to be judged by it. I regard it as most fortunate
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>that, without knowledge that any such legislation was
</p>
<p>pending, it happened in my way to place our record with
</p>
<p>the Naval Committee.
</p>
<p>If in the course of the debate sweeping animadversion
</p>
<p>may be made upon contractors under the system hitherto,
</p>
<p>your sentiments of fairness, regard for the fame of Boston
</p>
<p>merchants, and (may I presume !) your confidence in the
</p>
<p>undersigned, may prompt you to speak in reply.
</p>
<p>With reference to "nominal prices," upon which so
</p>
<p>much is said, this is our reply : We were compelled to use
</p>
<p>an old system, provided by law, as it long had been used
</p>
<p>and accepted by the department, or retire from the com-
</p>
<p>petition.
</p>
<p>If all houses who would be honorable dealers with the
</p>
<p>government thus retired from the field, the government,
</p>
<p>with a bad system, would be entirely in bad hands.
</p>
<p>We did our part, as soon as we comprehended the evils
</p>
<p>of the system, in recording our regret that they existed,
</p>
<p>and our desire for their remedy.
</p>
<p>With a renewal of thanks for your courtesy,
</p>
<p>I am yours, respectfully and truly,
</p>
<p>Franklin W. Smith.
</p>
<p>Hon. D. W. GoocH, Washington, D. C.
</p>
<p>Through the concurrent effort of Hon. Messrs. Gooch
</p>
<p>and Sedgwick, and in accordance with the recommenda-
</p>
<p>tions of Smith Brothers & Co., the joint resolution

<p>approved March 3, 1863, which was in place of that
</p>
<p>recommitted in February, provided that ** every contract
</p>
<p>shall require the delivery of a specified quantity."
</p>
<p>This requirement of the law, that the Navy Depart-
</p>
<p>ment should contract for fixed quantities, caused nominal
</p>
<p>prices to disappear at once from the bids upon the next
</p>
<p>proposals for supplies.

</p>
<p>Boston, December ii, 1863.
</p>
<p>Hon. E. L. Norton,
</p>
<p>Sir : I respond with pleasure to your request for the
</p>
<p>statement of my judgment upon inquiries submitted by the
</p>
<p>Commissioner of the Naval Code, viz. :
</p>
<p>First. " Whether the present contract system might be
</p>
<p>modified and changed, so as to avoid objection and prevent
</p>
<p>fraud."
</p>
<p>Second. " Whether any more thorough and strict sys-
</p>
<p>tem of inspection and accounting for supplies and materials
</p>
<p>purchased ought to be adopted to secure the department
</p>
<p>against imposition."
</p>
<p>" The joint resolution regulating contracts with the Navy
</p>
<p>Department," approved march 3, 1863, provided "that
</p>
<p>every contract shall require the delivery of a specific quan-
</p>
<p>tity." This was a decided reformation of the old system
</p>
<p>for unlimited supplies, upon the lowest aggregate bid upon
</p>
<p>a quantity ; which left upon the published report of the
</p>
<p>department, for several years, such absurd records of
</p>
<p>government bargains.
</p>
<p>In a communication addressed by me to the chairman of
</p>
<p>the Committee on Naval Affairs, in February, 1863, the
</p>
<p>prediction was made that if the Navy Department would
</p>
<p>advertise for ' ' no more and no less ' ' than the quantity to
</p>
<p>be received under the contract, fictitious and excessive
</p>
<p>prices, which had been an evil and a reproach, would dis-
</p>
<p>appear. Existing contracts for specific quantities, executed
</p>
<p>under the present law, demonstrate the truth of the asser-
</p>
<p>tion. By this reform, therefore, the most prominent evils
</p>
<p>of past years have been removed.
</p>
<p>Yet additional safeguards of law, scrupulously applied by
</p>
<p>the authorities, are requisite before the confidence of the
</p>
<p>community can be commanded, and before there can be
</p>
<p>certainty that the obligations of contractors are faithfully

</p>
<p>fulfilled.
</p>
<p>These safeguards are required as to the following
</p>
<p>questions :
</p>
<p>First. Is there assurance to the public of absolute fair-
</p>
<p>ness in the reception of bids and award of contracts?
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>Second. Are the schedules of merchandise for which
</p>
<p>bids are invited sufficiently explicit in the description of
</p>
<p>merchandise to be furnished ?
</p>
<p>Third. Is the system for the receipt of merchandise so
</p>
<p>systematically protected that government cannot be de-
</p>
<p>frauded in quantity or quality ?
</p>
<p>For satisfaction to the mercantile community upon the
</p>
<p>first inquiry above suggested, it must be known that all
</p>
<p>preliminary arrangements for the award of contracts are
</p>
<p>scrupulously guarded against collusion of clerks with
</p>
<p>favored parties, and against inaccuracy in computations or
</p>
<p>irregularity in the form of bids.
</p>
<p>The advertisement for proposals should state that the
</p>
<p>opening of bids (no longer, as formerly, in secret with
</p>
<p>chiefs and clerks of bureaus), is by law provided to be in the
</p>
<p>presence of bidders.
</p>
<p>Bids should be received in closed safes prepared for the
</p>
<p>purpose, secured against all inspection until the hour of
</p>
<p>opening named in the advertisement. Then, in presence
</p>
<p>of competing parties or their agents, they should be with-
</p>
<p>drawn, sorted and stamped with a seal privately retained
</p>
<p>by chiefs of bureaus for the purpose.

</p>
<p>These details are by no means over-cautious in transac-
</p>
<p>tions which involve not only large expenditures of money,
</p>
<p>but the good faith of government toward the people.
</p>
<p>Officers who have in charge such important business inter-
</p>
<p>ests should 7iot be satisfied -jnerely with their own belief that
</p>
<p>there is no wrong committed. They should be eager to
</p>
<p>arrange evidence for the pnbHc, that 710 wrong can be

<p>committed.

</p>
<p>This is a question vital to the interests of the government

<p>under any systefn of purchase. No fairness of price, no
</p>
<p>high standard of quaHty, can compete against the fraudu-
</p>
<p>lent collusion of dishonest traders with weighmasters and

</p>
<p>style of robbery in navy yards. Indeed, it is frequently
</p>
<p>remarked, as an irremediable evil, that government must
</p>
<p>be robbed to some extent in the delivery of merchandise ;
</p>
<p>because it is inevitable that there will be some dishonest
</p>
<p>men. Yet because of this extraordinary exposure to wrong,
</p>
<p>22
</p>
<p>extraordinary protective and detective measures are de-
</p>
<p>manded at the hands of executive officers in the depart-
</p>
<p>ments. A system should be devised so thorough in its
</p>
<p>checks and counterchecks, that rogues cannot disarrange
</p>
<p>its machinery without being caught in its traps.
</p>
<p>I do not hesitate to state as my beUef, based upon
</p>
<p>unusual facilities for judgment, that there is not at present
</p>
<p>a system in navy yards sufficiently protective against short
</p>
<p>weights and measures.
</p>
<p>Doors are open which should be closed and doubly
</p>
<p>locked.
</p>
<p>There are means for the perpetration of this wrong, with-
</p>
<p>out and beyond the knowledge of the naval storekeeper,
</p>
<p>who may be honest meanwhile in the exercise of his func-
</p>
<p>tions. I am aware this is an important statement. It is
</p>
<p>made in full conviction of its importance and its truth.
</p>
<p>It must be entirely practicable to remedy all exposure to
</p>
<p>this evil, and, through enterprise and ingenuity, not only
</p>
<p>to devise an effective system of protection against fraud in
</p>
<p>the delivery of merchandise, but to insure its faithful
</p>
<p>execution.
</p>
<p>The Bank of England, in its internal administration, is
</p>
<p>like an apartment walled with mirrors ; each action therein
</p>
<p>is reflected in various directions to the observation of others,
</p>
<p>as honest or dishonest.
</p>
<p>When the Navy Department is developed upon so vast
</p>
<p>a scale as to require an appropriation of $140,000,000, like
</p>
<p>precision in system will be required to afford protection to
</p>
<p>government. As additional security to the present system,
</p>
<p>I venture the suggestion that there should be in every navy
</p>
<p>yard a naval store receiver, as well as naval storekeeper.
</p>
<p>When such reforms as these, above detailed, are applied
</p>
<p>in the administration of the bureaus and at the yards, it
</p>
<p>will be difficult to show objections to a contract system, or

</p>
<p>opportunities for fraud in purchases by either contract or
</p>
<p>open purchase.
</p>
<p>It is possible that the suggestions herein submitted may
</p>
<p>23
</p>
<p>be regarded as intrusive by some to whose official functions
</p>
<p>they have special relation.
</p>
<p>Yet it may without presumption be assumed that the
</p>
<p>business transactions with the department of the house of
</p>
<p>which the writer is a member, amounting to more than a
</p>
<p>million of dollars, and demanding of him during two years
</p>
<p>almost daily visitation of the workshops and offices of the
</p>
<p>navy yard, involving the supply of a great variety of
</p>
<p>articles entering into consumption and use throughout the
</p>
<p>mechanical departments and on shipboard, ought to have
</p>
<p>furnished to a merchant facihties for judgment as to the
</p>
<p>system in practice entitled to some consideration.
</p>
<p>Faithful officers of the government who would vigilantly
</p>
<p>guard its interests and exact its claims will invite the
</p>
<p>thorough scrutiny and welcome the respectful suggestion
</p>
<p>of citizens, as zealous as themselves for the welfare of
</p>
<p>government, and contributing, perhaps, as much to its
</p>
<p>support.
</p>
<p>An ex- President of the United States has said : " It is a
</p>
<p>condition for the enjoyment of liberty that our rulers be
</p>
<p>narrowly watched. It can never be long preserved without
</p>
<p>popular jealousy. It is a maxim of despots that the people
</p>
<p>should never inquire into the concerns of government."
</p>
<p>Transactions with government have been subject to such
</p>
<p>general suspicion that merchants sensitive to their good
</p>
<p>name are reluctant to engage in them, exposing themselves
</p>
<p>to disparagement and scandal. Yet shall those of the mer-
</p>
<p>cantile community who would maintain their own integrity
</p>
<p>abandon the comipetition ? Or shall they enter the lists, to
</p>
<p>strive against temptation to themselves and for its removal
</p>
<p>from others?
</p>
<p>The case seems to be this : Rogues, as may be expected,
</p>
<p>approach government for business. Executive officers are
</p>
<p>not sufficiently expert for their detection ; therefore, all

</p>
<p>who solicit government patronage are under distrust and
</p>
<p>suspicion.
</p>
<p>Again : It is not through the dereliction of citizen con
</p>
<p>tractors alone that government may be defrauded. Evi
</p>
<p>dence is on record that government employes, either by
</p>
<p>mal-intent or through inadvertence, have been as greatly
</p>
<p>24
</p>
<p>in fault. Results may be known outside of government
</p>
<p>offices which are individual secrets within them.
</p>
<p>sK * * * . *
</p>
<p>While in compliance with your request, and under im-
</p>
<p>pression of the importance of the subject, I have frankly
</p>
<p>advocated amendment in details of administration, it has
</p>
<p>been without the least impulse of disrespect for officers of
</p>
<p>the government or the disparagement of their services ; but
</p>
<p>for a record against evils from which the business world
</p>
<p>believes our government to receive material injury.
</p>
<p>We improved the earliest opportunity after apprehending
</p>
<p>the evils of the contract system (in 1861), to expose them
</p>
<p>to the department, remarking : ' ' We shall be glad to aid
</p>
<p>any effort to replace it by one more distinct in its demands
</p>
<p>upon the seller of merchandise, and therefore far more
</p>
<p>agreeable to those who would be honorable competitors for
</p>
<p>government patronage. "
</p>
<p>It was a gratification that opportunity occurred to press
</p>
<p>legislation for this purpose, and that reform was accomp-
</p>
<p>lished, during the subsequent period, as observation
</p>
<p>informed of remaining facilities for wrong, impatience has
</p>
<p>been felt for their removal.
</p>
<p>At a time when our government is engaged in an ex-
</p>
<p>haustive struggle for life, I have been compelled as a citi-
</p>
<p>zen to urge its protection against unfaithfulness in its service
</p>
<p>and fraud by those enjoying its patronage.

<p>Letter to the Secretary of the Navy, with art ajialysis of cer-
</p>
<p>tain contracts of the N'avy Departme?it, as appendix to
</p>
<p>paper addressed to the Commissioner of the Naval Code.
</p>
<p>[Privately printed for the Secretary of the Navy and the Com-
</p>
<p>mittees on Naval Affairs of the Senate and House of Repre-
</p>
<p>sentatives.]
</p>
<p>Boston, January 29, 1864.
</p>
<p>To THE Hon. the Secretary of the Navy,
</p>
<p>Sir : In the communication to the Commissioner of the
</p>
<p>naval code, copy of which I had the honor to address to
</p>
<p>you on the 29th ultimo, reference was made to the errone-
</p>
<p>ous computations and eyionnous prices of certain contracts
</p>
<p>by which it was believed that the government had suffered
</p>
<p>loss.
</p>
<p>At that time the statement was fully warranted upon the
</p>
<p>personal knowledge of the writer. The suggestion of the
</p>
<p>existence of such wrong to the department was supposed
</p>
<p>by him to be the entire fulfilment of his duty. Facts
</p>
<p>which have subsequently been made public compel him
</p>
<p>now, in faithfulness to the country and to himself, to place
</p>
<p>before you a more distinct statement of the case.
</p>
<p>The Boston fournal recently published a copy of one of
</p>
<p>these suspicious contracts  that, wherein $150 per dozen

</p>
<p>26
</p>
<p>were paid for wrenches worth $io to $15 per dozen. The
</p>
<p>writer of that article proceeds to explain the transaction, ' ' in
</p>
<p>justice to the Navy Department," as attributable to the
</p>
<p>system (formerly existing under law of 1855), of bidding at
</p>
<p>high prices and low prices, according to the quantities
</p>
<p>Hkely to be required. This theory was probably accepted
</p>
<p>from the speech of Senator Grimes (Cong. Globe, Jan. 9),
</p>
<p>I ut is altogether erroneous ; since all the prices were ex-
</p>
<p>orbitant, and the quantities limited under the act of March,
</p>
<p>1863.
</p>
<p>It was also asserted that the bid was a fair specimen of
</p>
<p>the bids for every contract ; when, in fact, the contract
</p>
<p>mentioned (and others on record as bad), is exceptio7ial,
</p>
<p>extraordinary, and must have had a peculiar history.
</p>
<p>Some contracts have appeared in the reports of the
</p>
<p>bureaus of an unprecedented character. The only expla-
</p>
<p>nation for them yet made to the public is incorrect ; in
</p>
<p>fact, their pecuHar history is as yet a secret. In the absence
</p>
<p>of authentic statements, false and exaggerated theories are
</p>
<p>applied ; scandal becomes excessive and wide-spread.
</p>
<p>Suppressio veri, suggestio falsi.
</p>
<p>It is especially unjust that merchants who have had no
</p>
<p>part in wrongful acts should be defamed in mass with those
</p>
<p>who have committed them. If obloquy is to be scattered
</p>
<p>broadcast over all concerned with government, because of
</p>
<p>the dishonor of individuals ; if integrity is not to be recog-
</p>
<p>nized when found, and vindicated from undeserved suspicion
</p>
<p>and reproach, the business of the nation will be yielded
</p>
<p>entirely to those who care not for reputation, having none
</p>
<p>to defend.
</p>
<p>We are not willing to share with others, in the least
</p>
<p>degree, the imputations of wrong in our relations to govern-
</p>
<p>ment, but will rather make an effort to place the discredit
</p>
<p>where it belongs.

</p>
<p>Upon our first movement for navy business, in 1861, we
</p>
<p>were repelled by records of the absurd bargains published
</p>
<p>in the reports of previous years. We were obliged to, fol-
</p>
<p>low precedents established under the law, or retire from
</p>
<p>the competition. The evils existing could only be appre-
</p>
<p>27
</p>
<p>hended by tracking them over forbidden ground. We
</p>
<p>vigorously joined in the raid upon them, by which the
</p>
<p>most prominent of those evils were remedied.
</p>
<p>During the period when contracts could only be obtained
</p>
<p>by calculation as to qMantities instead of vahies of merchan-
</p>
<p>dise, and consequently by bids of anomalous prices, we
</p>
<p>improved an opportunity to demonstrate by figures to the
</p>
<p>Bureau of Yards and Docks that the average per cent, of
</p>
<p>profit to us did not exceed or equal a fair mercantile rate.
</p>
<p>We invite, and will aid in like manner, the'utmost scrutiny
</p>
<p>of all our transactions with the department.
</p>
<p>The files of the bureaus, and the testimony of members
</p>
<p>of Congress from Massachusetts, will witness that we have
</p>
<p>advocated the remedy of abuses at once upon their dis-
</p>
<p>covery. The following pages will discover an onerous task
</p>
<p>assumed in this service.
</p>
<p>In full confidence of your eager desire for the detection
</p>
<p>and remedy of abuses in the administration of the Navy
</p>
<p>Department, and realizing that amid your most arduous
</p>
<p>and important services for the country you must necessarily
</p>
<p>be uninformed. of such statements as are annexed, they are
</p>
<p>respectfully submitted to your consideration.

<p>I remain, sir, most respectfully.
</p>
<p>Your obedient servant,

<p>To THE Hon. Secretary of the Navy.
</p>
<p>With this letter, Mr. Smith's pamphlet was presented
</p>
<p>to the Secretary of the Navy, in person, and in company
</p>
<p>with Hon. A. H, Rice, of Massachusetts. It was subse-
</p>
<p>quently printed in full in the Report of the Select Com-

</p>
<p>Senator Sumner,* took measures for the protection of
</p>
<p>an opening of bids to be made that day. Several mer-
</p>
<p>cantile houses of Boston were by mutual arrangement
</p>
<p>represented on the occasion. The opening was, accord-

<p>ing to their request, prosecuted through a continuous

<p>The interesting revelations made at that time do not

<p>The pamphlet above mentioned was referred by the

</p>
<p>that certain contractors could not have obtained the
</p>
<p>extraordinarily profitable contracts in question through any
</p>
<p>mere chance of bidding ; but that through information, by
</p>
<p>collusion, said results were obtained.
</p>
<p>" Besides, however, the internal evidence of the Report
</p>
<p>of the Secretary which the writer has collated, (at expense
</p>
<p>of personal labor, time and money, and exposure to resent-
</p>
<p>ful attacks), there cayi be other collateral evidence to substa?i-
</p>
<p>tiate the truth.

</p>
<p>Their unwarranted insinuation and weak satire will have
</p>
<p>full exposure in a subsequent paper. The communication

<p>Hale, Buckalew and Doolittle to investigate them.
</p>
<p>On the I ith of February, 1864, F. W. Smith testified

</p>
<p>navy contracts by Mr. Franklin W. Smith, of Smith

<p>Brothers & Co. , a mercantile house in Boston, and as the

<p>matter then presented was deemed of sufficient importance
</p>
<p>by the Secretary of the Navy to submit the same to certain
</p>
<p>heads of Bureaus in the Navy Department, and they sever-

</p>
<p>together with the evidence taken in the case, leaving the

<p>Senate to form such conclusion therefrom as the facts and

<p>allegations therein shall justify.
</p>
<p>" The committee will now present to the Senate certain
</p>
<p>statements of facts which they think the evidence by them
</p>
<p>taken will justify. They have confined themselves in their

<p>examination to recent occurrences, thinking that the latest
</p>
<p>transactions will afford the best evidence of the present state

<p>of affairs, and show most clearly what are the evils for

<p>which remedies should be sought.

<p>" In the first place, then, your committee start with the

<p>announcement that the investigations which they have

<p>made satisfy them beyond a doubt that, in the matter of
</p>
<p>naval supplies last year, the government has been grossly
</p>
<p>defrauded by having to pay most exorbitant and enormous
</p>
<p>prices for very many of the articles procured by contract
</p>
<p>with the heads of several of the bureaus. They will submit
</p>
<p>a few of the more gross and palpable instances in support

<p>of this assertion, and suggest some of the means by which

<p>" 3. This inquiry into this subject of naval contracts
</p>
<p>mainly arose upon an exposition of them by Franklin W.
</p>
<p>Smith, a merchant of Boston, and the evidence and papers
</p>
<p>herewith reported will show the thoroughness and ability
</p>
<p>with which his examination was made, and the particular
</p>
<p>replies on the different points given thereto on behalf of the
</p>
<p>department. The recriminations against him appear in the
</p>
<p>replies and in the testimony taken before the committee.
</p>
<p>There can be no question of his intelligence and capacity,
</p>
<p>nor would it be unreasonable to assert that the public are
</p>
<p>indebted to him for much of valuable information upon the
</p>
<p>subjects covered by this investigation. Since his examina-
</p>
<p>tion before the committee, he has been arrested at Boston,
</p>
<p>it is believed at the instance of the Navy Department, upon
</p>
<p>some accusation or allegation of over-charge or imposition
</p>
<p>in furnishing naval supplies. It is to be hoped, for the
</p>
<p>credit of the government, that this arrest, following close
</p>
<p>upon his examination before the committee, will be fully

<p>Immediately upon the publication of this Report,
</p>
<p>rumors of retaliation upon F. W. Smith, by officials of
</p>
<p>the Navy Department reached Boston, and were brought
</p>
<p>in person by Hon. J. P. Hale, on his way to New Hamp-

<p>and said '* The Navy Department will slaughter Franklin

<p>A Preliminary Assault of the Navy Department in the U. S.
</p>
<p>Senate.
</p>
<p>On the 23d of May, 1864, the Senator from Iowa,
</p>
<p>spoke at length in reply to an adverse report by the
</p>
<p>Committee on Naval Supplies, upon a proposition from
</p>
<p>the Navy Department, that purchases should be made
</p>
<p>by regular officers of the Navy, instead of Navy agents
</p>
<p>who were civilians.
</p>
<p>Extract from Correspondence of the ''BOSTON DAILY
</p>
<p>ADVERTISER," June 8, 1864.
</p>
<p>" Our readers will observe that the Senator singled out
</p>
<p>" Mr. Franklin W. Smith, of Smith Brothers & Co., for
</p>
<p>" his severest denunciation. In doing this the Senator did
</p>
<p>" great injustice to the house in question. As to the injus-
</p>
<p>' * tice, we will call attention to the letter by Mr. Franklin
</p>
<p>" W. Smith, embodied in Mr. Hale's reply, which, we
</p>
<p>" believe, supplies a complete answer to the substance of
</p>
<p>" the, charges made by Mr. Grimes.
</p>
<p>"It is proper to add that, at the close of the debate,
</p>
<p>" Mr. Sumner rose to express his confidence in the entire
</p>
<p>' ' good faith with which the Messrs. Smith had dealt witii
</p>
<p>" the government.
</p>
<p>" Nearly the whole Massachusetts' delegation in both
</p>
<p>" Houses, we believe, would have joined in this expression ;

<p>35
</p>
<p>" this city, who knows their course thoroughly, has said
</p>
<p>* * that not only have their transactions been honorable and
</p>
<p>'' executed faithfully, but that they have labored diligently
</p>
<p>' ' to break up that system of awarding contracts which has
</p>
<p>' ' been the source of so much fraudulent dealing with the
</p>
<p>" government. It is, indeed, the fact, we believe, that
</p>
<p>" Mr. Franklin W. Smith has acted as a zealous reformer
</p>
<p>" in this matter, and is now meeting the reformer's custo-
</p>
<p>" mary reward, after having been largely instrumental in
</p>
<p>" overturning the old system of fictitious bidding.'.'
</p>
<p>In proof of the vindictive character of this attack,
</p>
<p>the following fact is stated : Haying heard that it was
</p>
<p>intended, Mr. F. W. Smith, with his brother, and part-
</p>
<p>ner Mr. Benjamin G. Smith, met the Senator from Iowa
</p>
<p>in the Senate ante-chamber and placed with him copies
</p>
<p>of the printed correspondence of F. W. Smith with the
</p>
<p>Secretary of the Navy and Chiefs of Bureaus, herein
</p>
<p>above cited, in advocacy of the reform which he finally
</p>
<p>accomplished, calling the Senator's attention to their
</p>
<p>date as early as February, 1862, and before the comple-
</p>
<p>tion of their first contract. Vet with this correspondence
</p>
<p>in his ha7ids, the Senator insinuated to the contrary, by
</p>
<p>an interrogation in his speech : " Did they ever address
</p>
<p>the Department on the subject ? "
</p>
<p>Hon. John P. Hale replied at once in support of the
</p>
<p>Report of the Naval Committee, and in vindication of

</p>
<p>Extracts from Speech of HON. JOHN P. HALE, of New
</p>
<p>Hampshire, in the United States Senate,
</p>
<p>May 23, 1864, (as follows) :
</p>
<p>^ yf. "^ ^ ^
</p>
<p>' ' A great portion of the labor of this effort of the Sena-
</p>
<p>tor is made upon Mr. Smith, of the firm of Smith Brothers
</p>
<p>& Co., of Boston. Let me say this of Mr. Smith : I know
</p>
<p>him ; he is a merchant of the highest character ; of unim-
</p>
<p>peachable integrity, and unblemished reputation with all
</p>
<p>who know him. There is not a mercantile house in Boston,
</p>
<p>and that is a place, I think, where the standard of mercan-
</p>
<p>tile integrity is as high as it is in any city of this Union 
</p>
<p>there is not a mercantile house nor a mercantile man in
</p>
<p>Boston whose reputation excels that of Mr. Smith. Mr.
</p>
<p>vSmith is not only a man eminent in the walks of mercantile
</p>
<p>and private life, of unspotted integrity, and of unsuspected
</p>
<p>fairness, but, beside all that, he is an able man ; he is a
</p>
<p>keen man as well as an honest man ; and do 3^ou want to
</p>
<p>know the secret of this hostility to Mr. S7nith?^^- I have it
</p>
<p>in my hand here now (holding up the pamphlets of Mr.
</p>
<p>Franklin W. Smith).
</p>
<p>" When the report of the Secretary of the Navy com-
</p>
<p>municated to the two Houses of Congress, on the 7th of
</p>
<p>December last, was published, Mr. Smith saw, as every man
</p>
<p>can see that will look at it, evidence of the grossest and
</p>
<p>most outrageous frauds under the published evidence of
</p>
<p>the Secretary of the Navy  not one of them perpetrated
</p>
<p>through the agency of the Navy agents. As became a man
</p>
<p>of integrity and of keen intellect, he, in a little pamphlet
</p>
<p>which I hold in my hand, exposed some of these frauds
</p>
<p>perpetrated, not through Navy agents, but through officials
</p>
<p>here at Washington. He exposed them in his pamphlet.
</p>
<p>Let me call your attention to one or two of them."
</p>

<p>pardoned in view of the malignant disparagement which they
</p>
<p>would counteract. The gentle proprieties of ordinary life are
</p>
<p>perforce suspended in a mortal conflict for life's chief treasure  a
</p>
<p>spotless reputat^ion.
</p>
<p>37
</p>
<p>(The contracts cited and the details of wrong and loss
</p>
<p>exposed can be found in the official report of the debate.)
</p>
<p>" Mr. Smith brought these facts to light and published
</p>
<p>them, and for it he is entitled to the thanks of every man
</p>
<p>who desires purity in the administration of the government.
</p>
<p>Instead of it he has received and secured to himself, and
</p>
<p>probably to his children after him, the undying hatred of
</p>
<p>the men whose conduct is thus implicated.
</p>
<p>Mr. Smith's Vindication.
</p>
<p>" Again, Mr. Smith has not only exposed these wrongs,
</p>
<p>but he has been guilty of another gross offense in the view
</p>
<p>of the heads of these bureaus. When his attention was
</p>
<p>first called to this subject of fictitious bidding, he looked
</p>
<p>back to years ago when it went on quietly year after year ;
</p>
<p>and not a word was said against it ; but the very first year
</p>
<p>Mr. Smith's attention was called to it he did what the
</p>
<p>Senator said he ought to have done ; he notified the heads
</p>
<p>of bureaus and the Secretary of the Navy of these frauds
</p>
<p>by correspondence. He had correspondence, too, with the
</p>
<p>gentleman appointed to prepare a naval code, and made a
</p>
<p>suggestion of the very frauds that had been practised, and
</p>
<p>the mode in which they might be practised ; and for that,
</p>
<p>too, he has committed, in the eyes of this gentleman, an
</p>
<p>unpardonable sin.
</p>
<p>' ' I have said that Mr. Smith is not only an honest man,
</p>
<p>but he is a keen man. I do not know that I shall be doing
</p>
<p>any injustice to the Senator from Iowa  I certainly do not
</p>
<p>mean to do any  if I say to the Senator from Iowa that he
</p>
<p>is quite as keen a man as he is, and I think he is a little
</p>
<p>keener in one respect. The Senator from Iowa  I do not
</p>
<p>mean to say anything unkind or disrespectful to him  is
</p>
<p>charged and surcharged with the concentrated venom of all
</p>
<p>the men that Mr. Smith has disturbed by writing this
</p>
<p>pamphlet, and he has been so highly charged that he let

<p>some of it off before he made his sjeech here, as I think
</p>
<p>the Senator will see when I read, as I propose to read, Mr.
</p>
<p>38
</p>
<p>Smith's answer to the speech of the gentleman, made before
</p>
<p>the speech was dehvered. I will read it."
</p>
<p>Mr. Hale here read in full a paper prepared by Mr.
</p>
<p>F. W. Smith in reply to the statements of the Senator
</p>
<p>from Iowa, which is on record in the report of the
</p>
<p>debate. It closed as follows :
</p>
<p>' ' We hope that our efforts in behalf of reform, our fear-
</p>
<p>less assertion of our rights as merchants in correspondence
</p>
<p>with heads of bureaus, and our exposure of collusion and
</p>
<p>fraud, have not stimulated an eager search for wrong on
</p>
<p>our part which has no existence in fact, and thus called
</p>
<p>down upon us an unfriendly criticism. I remain, sir, re-
</p>
<p>spectfully, Your obedient servant,

<p>"Franklin W. Smith.
</p>
<p>" Hon. John P. Hale,
</p>
<p>' ' Chairmaji of Senate Committee on Naval Affairs. ' '
</p>
<p>Mr. Hale continued :
</p>
<p>' ' Mr. President, I have read this long communication to
</p>
<p>the Senate because I thought it due to a gentleman whose
</p>
<p>character was thus assailed, and, I think, as it will be pub-
</p>
<p>lished side by side with the statements of the Senator from
</p>
<p>Iowa, that the injurious imputations thrown upon the
</p>
<p>character of Mr. Smith will carry with them their own
</p>
<p>antidote. I believe there is no higher duty that a Senator
</p>
<p>or the Senate owes to the country, to the government and
</p>
<p>to itself, than to vindicate, whenever it is unjustly assailed,
</p>
<p>the character of any citizen whose conduct may be thus
</p>
<p>brought before the Senate. Neither shall I, at any time be
</p>
<p>deterred from the course which I think my duty imposes

<p>upon me in defense of individual character, or in ferreting

<p>out public wrongs wherever I may believe that they exist. ' '

<p>A few weeks after the warning of Senator Hale,

<p>merchants of Boston, of whom Smith Brothers had

<p>purchased merchandise for the Navy, informed them

<p>that they had been summoned before a detective inqui-

<p>the firm, in short delivery of goods sold to the depart-

</p>
<p>to exist as a practice elsewhere, through collusion of
</p>
<p>officials, would be also found in Boston.
</p>
<p>The books of these merchants tallied to an iota with

<p>Smith Brothers were followed in vain.

</p>
<p>Editorial from the ''BOSTON POST," June 18th.
</p>
<p>' ' For some time past a Select Committee, appointed by
</p>
<p>authorities at Washington, have been investigating matters
</p>
<p>connected with navy contracts at this port, and as a result
</p>
<p>of their investigations, two members of the firm of Smith
</p>
<p>Brothers, dealers in hardware, at No. 102 Federal street,
</p>
<p>were arrested yesterday by military authorities, their store
</p>
<p>taken possession of, and they sent to Fort Warren.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Franklin W. Smith, the senior member of the
</p>
<p>firm, has been in business in this city for many years, and
</p>
<p>no firm stands higher than his, in the confidence of the
</p>
<p>community. The transactions of Mr. Smith with the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment commenced some three years ago, since which
</p>
<p>time his firm has been almost exclusively engaged in fur-
</p>
<p>nishing Naval Supplies under contracts. We are informed
</p>
<p>that the prices paid for supplies which they have furnished,
</p>
<p>as appears by official reports, have been more favorable to
</p>
<p>the government than those paid at any other yard. There
</p>
<p>would seem to be no chance, therefore, for any swindle.
</p>
<p>"Some two years ago, Mr. Franklin W. Smith, the
</p>
<p>senior member of the firm, in a series of letters to the Navy
</p>
<p>Department, exposed the manner in which the government
</p>
<p>had been grossly swindled under Navy contracts, and rec-
</p>
<p>ommended a change in the system of making these con-
</p>
<p>tracts. The reform was made by Congress, upon his sug-
</p>
<p>gestion. By his fearless exposure of these abuses, he
</p>
<p>gained the enmity of swindling contractors and of parties
</p>
<p>in the Bureau of the Navy Department, whose collusion
</p>
<p>with these contractors was more than suspected. The im-
</p>
<p>pression among the friends of Mr. Smith who know these
</p>
<p>facts is, that the proceedings against him are purely
</p>
<p>malicious. ' '
</p>
<p>To paralyze public sympathy by indications of serious
</p>
<p>allegations against the Smiths when no charges what-

<p>ever had been presented, as required by law, bail to the
</p>
<p>amount of ;^ 500,000 was demanded. Immediately it
</p>
<p>was telegraphed that ^1,000,000 would be offered, and
</p>
<p>44
</p>
<p>within twenty-four hours that amount was tendered by
</p>
<p>indip^nant citizens of Boston. When it was seen that
</p>
<p>the ruse to carry pubHc condemnation by storm had
</p>
<p>miscarried and recoiled, it was wired from the Navy
</p>
<p>Department that a bond of ;^20,ooo would suffice. Upon
</p>
<p>this, Smith Brothers returned at once to Boston, after
</p>
<p>most courteous and hospitable treatment in the fort by
</p>
<p>Col. Dimock, the commandant. He said that he had no
</p>
<p>precedent for detention of merchants in a fortress, and
</p>
<p>therefore installed them in quarters adjoining his own,
</p>
<p>shared with them his table, and gave them the range of
</p>
<p>the fortification and island.
</p>
<p>But while they were quickly released through the
</p>
<p>energy of Massachusetts Congressmen and their fellow
</p>
<p>citizens, their books and papers were sent to Philadel-
</p>
<p>phia, where, as was proved, charges were manufactured
</p>
<p>therefrom to make ground for an arrest which had been
</p>
<p>made without shadow of reason, and in utter violation
</p>
<p>of the " Rules and Regulations " provided for military
</p>
<p>arrests, above quoted.
</p>
<p>It was not until the i ith of August, 1864, two months
</p>
<p>later, that " charges and specifications " were addressed
</p>
<p>to F. W. Smith at the department.
</p>
<p>These charges did not involve a loss of above ;^ 5 00 in
</p>
<p>the aggregate on four different specifications. Subse-
</p>
<p>quently another allegation of ;^2,ooo damage upon a sale
</p>
<p>of pig iron (on which the government made a saving of
</p>
<p>;^ 30,000 in value before delivery), was added; but this
</p>
<p>count was at once abandoned by the court.

<p>In the report of the Committee of the Boston Board
</p>
<p>45
</p>
<p>of Trade in review of the case occurs the following sum-
</p>
<p>mary of these charges :
</p>
<p>" In a word, your committee do not hesitate to express
</p>
<p>the opinion that a7i wiporter of the different ki?ids of tin, a
</p>
<p>dealer i?i foreign and domestic iron, and an irnporter of
</p>
<p>hardware, acting as referees, for a trifli^ig fee, would have
</p>
<p>heard the case in teyi or twelve hours, and have made an
</p>
<p>award satisfactory to the most respectable co?nmercial houses
</p>
<p>in the United States ajid iii Europe.
</p>
<p>"The transactions of Smith Brothers & Co., with the
</p>
<p>Navy Department amounted to about a million and a
</p>
<p>quarter of dollars ; and so numerous were the articles
</p>
<p>delivered that the entries of sales cover twelve hundred and
</p>
<p>five pages. We give a single instance of details. In a
</p>
<p>contract for the precise sum of $19,902.13, a ivitness for
</p>
<p>the prosecutio7i estimated thus :
</p>
<p>" 251 articles upon different lines. 80,000 tacks and brads.
</p>
<p>12,564 single articles. 6 sets of carpenter's tools.
</p>
<p>171 barrels. 600 feet of chain.
</p>
<p>53,509 pounds of articles asst'd. 52 reams of paper.
</p>
<p>12,000 tallies. I 10 boxes of tin.
</p>
<p>250 gross assorted. j 64 iron girders.
</p>
<p>"Of these, alleged to be of inferior quality at the trial,
</p>
<p>were, i mason's hammer, i rachet drill, i pair dividers, i
</p>
<p>spirit level, 2 pickaxes, i drawing knife, i drill stock, i
</p>
<p>dozen chisels, i sheet sand paper, i sickle, i hoe, 2
</p>
<p>shovels, I axe, i handsaw, i hammer, 5 manure forks, i
</p>
<p>spade, 6 scythes and 6 rakes.
</p>
<p>"In view of such facts, the charge of 'fraud,' or of
</p>
<p>fraudulent intention, is utterly frivolous. The wonder,
</p>
<p>indeed, is that, in so large a business, and in the condition
</p>
<p>of the market since the beginning of the war, the number
</p>
<p>of articles below the standard quality should be so very
</p>
<p>limited. Of the general good quality of the goods and

<p>wares sold and delivered, there can be no doubt. No less
</p>
<p>than ninety merchants and manufacttirers, who sold goods to
</p>
<p>46
</p>
<p>Smith Brothers & Co. , to the amount nearly of one million
</p>
<p>of dollars, declare, in a paper which was transmitted to the
</p>
<p>late deeply lamented Presidejit of the United States, that hav-
</p>
<p>ing furnished that firm ' with merchandise at various tirnes
</p>
<p>within the past three years, desti7iedfor the use of the United
</p>
<p>States Navy Depart7nent, we hereby certify that we have in
</p>
<p>all cases sold and delivered to them such qualities as we
</p>
<p>believed would be entirely satisfactory to and fitted for the
</p>
<p>use of the Departme?it, a7id such as we should have supplied
</p>
<p>had the order been made upoji us directly by the Gover7i7nent. '
</p>
<p>"Frauds, cheatings, should show great gains. But
</p>
<p>your committee are satisfied, that this large, complicated
</p>
<p>and vexatious business was transacted for a very moderate
</p>
<p>compensation. In the course of the trial, ' Mr. B. G.
</p>
<p>Smith testified that, upon as an exact approximation as he
</p>
<p>had been able to make, the net profits left to Smith Brothers
</p>
<p>& Co., on the first of February, 1864, were about five per
</p>
<p>cent, upon the amount of sales.'
</p>
<p>** Few merchants of reputation, as we venture to suggest,
</p>
<p>will be anxious hereafter to become ' contractors, ' for twice
</p>
<p>or thrice five per cent, profit, when, besides the notorious
</p>
<p>delays in payment, fines and Bastiles are in the prospective,
</p>
<p>for alleged default in the quality of a saw or of a hammer ;
</p>
<p>or because, owing to the operation of the tariff on importa-
</p>
<p>tions fro7}i Europe of articles produced east of the Cape of
</p>
<p>Good Hope, there is a difference of two cents the pound in
</p>
<p>tins of about the same purity, and of the same intrinsic
</p>
<p>value ; ay, because Banca, not Revely, is ' nominated in
</p>
<p>the bond.' "
</p>
<p>Accompanying the charges and specifications was an
</p>
<p>order to appear before a court-martial at Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>Then a delegation went to President Lincoln in remon-
</p>
<p>strance.
</p>
<p>This delegation comprised Senator Wilson of Massa-

</p>
<p>chusetts, Judge Thomas, and the late Hon. Wm. B.
</p>
<p>Spooner, one of the most eminent and philanthropic
</p>
<p>citizens of Boston. When Senator Wilson opened the
</p>
<p>47
</p>
<p>case, President Lincoln replied : " I know all about it,
</p>
<p>Wilson ; it is a fight between a department and a citizen,
</p>
<p>and the citizen has no fair show. I propose to quash
</p>
<p>the whole thing." " No," said the Senator, '' we hope
</p>
<p>you will do no such thing. Smith Brothers wish it
</p>
<p>never to be said that this charge was fixed up through
</p>
<p>influence. They challenge the fight, but want protec-
</p>
<p>tion against conspiracy and a court chosen by their
</p>
<p>enemies."
</p>
<p>*' You are right," said the President, " go tell the
</p>
<p>Smiths I'd as leave be tried by the devil on a court-
</p>
<p>martial, as anybody else, if it can be looked up after-
</p>
<p>wards. Let them run their machine, and I will take it
</p>
<p>up when they are done."
</p>
<p>Despite the countermand, a second order was issued
</p>
<p>for the defendants to go to the court in Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>The delegation returned to the President, who sent for
</p>
<p>Secretary Welles and asked the reason. " We have no
</p>
<p>money," said he, " to pay expenses of sending the court
</p>
<p>to Boston." " I guess you can find some," said the
</p>
<p>President. " Order the court to Boston!' The trial sub-
</p>
<p>sequently cost Smith Brothers twenty thousand dollars,
</p>
<p>and much more to the government.
</p>
<p>At length, in September, 1864, the Naval Court con-
</p>
<p>vened in the Navy Yard at Boston. It was composed
</p>
<p>of seven naval officers, retired for old age or in-
</p>
<p>competency on "half pay;" some of whom were noted
</p>
<p>on the Naval Register as " not recommended for promo-
</p>
<p>tion." These absolute judges of both law and fact were

<p>chosen by the accusers, one of whom had been heard to
</p>
<p>48
</p>
<p>say, " We constitute courts to convict!''^ So long as their
</p>
<p>decisions suited the appointing power these superan-
</p>
<p>nuated officers received " full pay." If not satisfactory,
</p>
<p>they could be ** relieved."
</p>
<p>Each page of testimony recorded in mammoth pen-
</p>
<p>manship paid the Judge Advocate a fee. It was piled
</p>
<p>up to an aggregate of 2,500 pages. Two judges advo-
</p>
<p>cate appeared before the close of the case. Four months
</p>
<p>were spent before the conclusion of the case by the court.
</p>
<p>On the 26th of January, 1865, the President ordered the
</p>
<p>record to be sent to him for examination and revision
</p>
<p>by counsel for the department, by whom all charges had
</p>
<p>been abandoned but that of ;^ioo, for a difference be-
</p>
<p>tween Banca and Revely tin.
</p>
<p>On the evening of March 13th, the President said to
</p>
<p>Mr. Sumner : *' I have read every word of the opinion
</p>
<p>of Eames, but by his own showing, only one case was
</p>
<p>in any way made out  that of the Banca tin. I wish,

<p>EXTRACTS FROM THE OPINION OF
</p>
<p>HON. CHARLES SUJMNER
</p>
<p>GIVEN AT REQUEST OF
</p>
<p>PRESIDENT LINCOLN FOR HIS REVIEW OF THE CASE.
</p>
<p>This paper with explanatory notes* was prepared by
</p>
<p>Mr. Sumner for the ninth volumes of his ** Works," the
</p>
<p>month before his death. He preceded it by the *' Ap-
</p>
<p>peal of the Massachusetts Delegation in Congress to the
</p>
<p>President of the United States," written by himself.
</p>
<p>Vide Addenda No. I.
</p>
<p>' ' The more I have examined this case, the more I have
</p>
<p>been surprised by the preliminary proceedings, the con-
</p>
<p>tinued prosecution, and the findings of the court. I can
</p>
<p>well understand how they were used in the House of Rep-
</p>
<p>resentatives as an argument for the total repeal of the Act
</p>
<p>of Congress authorizing the trial of civilians by courts-
</p>
<p>martial. Such a case must make us fear that, under this
</p>
<p>Act, justice may be sacrificed. It might make honest
</p>
<p>merchants hesitate to enter into business relations with the
</p>
<p>government.
</p>
<p>" On careful examination, it seems that the whole prose-
</p>
<p>cution, so far as proof is seriously pretended, is reduced to
</p>
<p>one single specification  to wit, the sale and delivery of
</p>
<p>* Senator Sumner presented to Mr. F. W. Smith all his manu-
</p>
<p>scripts upon the case. They are valuable autographic souvenirs
</p>
<p>of that indefatigable consecration to justice, which was the noble
</p>
<p>characteristic of his life.

</p>
<p>five thousand pounds of a tin called Revely, instead of a tin
</p>
<p>called Banca, by which, at most, the government lost one
</p>
<p>hundred dollars."
</p>
<p>" Look at this carefully, and the wonder increases that
</p>
<p>these proceedings were ever instituted.
</p>
<p>* ' I . The first remark to make is, that, even according to
</p>
<p>the finding of the court, the government has suffered only to
</p>
<p>the amount of one hundred dollars  being the difference in
</p>
<p>price between the two kinds of tin at the date of delivery.
</p>
<p>The pettiness of this loss is still more apparent when it is
</p>
<p>considered that the transactions of the respondents with
</p>
<p>the government reached the sum of more than twelve hun-
</p>
<p>dred thousand dollars, having such infinite details that they
</p>
<p>covered twelve hundred and five pages of sales. Surely, on
</p>
<p>every principle of reason or evidence, the insignificance of
</p>
<p>this loss, in transactions on so large a scale, and extending
</p>
<p>over three years of time, constitutes an unanswerable pre-
</p>
<p>sumption in favor of the respondents, excluding, as it does,
</p>
<p>any adaquate motive for the perpetration of fraud. * *
</p>
<p>If a mountain in labor ever brought forth a mouse, it is this
</p>
<p>mountainous prosecution, whose only offspring yet crawling
</p>
<p>on earth is ayi allegation of loss to the Uiiited States of one
</p>
<p>hund^^ed dollars ! But, if we look further at this tra?isac-
</p>
<p>tio7i, it will be seen that it is absolutely unimpeachable.
</p>
<p>" It appears that, according to extensive and long con-
</p>
<p>tinued usage, Revely is included under Banca ; that,
</p>
<p>according to usage at the navy yard, it was treated as
</p>
<p>Banca ; that the whole transaction and the delivery were
</p>
<p>open and without any concealment ; that Revely was actually
</p>
<p>accepted by the officers of the government in performance
</p>
<p>of the contract ; that the respondents never expected to
</p>
<p>supply other than Revely ; and lastly, that the prices paid
</p>
<p>shows that Revely was intended. Surely this is enough.
</p>
<p>I forbear to go into the evidence of founders and plumbers,

<p>'* It appears that Franklin W. Smith, one of the respond-
</p>
<p>ents, published a pamphlet, in which he exposed abuses in
</p>
<p>the contract system in the Navy Department, and it is
</p>
<p>understood that sundry officials felt aggrieved by these dis-
</p>
<p>closures. The spirit of these officials appears sufficiently
</p>
<p>in the following extract from a letter of one of the witnesses
</p>
<p>of the government, holding an important position in the
</p>
<p>Navy Department, addressed to another witness, himself
</p>
<p>an official also :

<p>cross-examination on which I forbear to comment. If the

<p>prosecution did not originate in the spirit which fills his

<p>that the eftbrt of Mr. Sumner was regarded as not only a
</p>
<p>defense of the individual citizen, but a contribution to good
</p>
<p>government.
</p>
<p>" Independent of its character, this case has an incidental
</p>
<p>interest. It was one of the last, if not the last, having a
</p>
<p>personal relation, that ever occupied the mind of President
</p>
<p>Lincoln. His indorsement, overruling the judgment and
</p>
<p>sentence, bears date March i8th. This was Saturday.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Rebellion was about to fall, and the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent left Washington, by boat, Thursday, March 23d, for
</p>
<p>City Point, the headquarters of the Army of Virginia,
</p>
<p>where he remained till after the surrender of Richmond,
</p>
<p>returning to Washington Sunday evening, April 9th, and
</p>
<p>being assassinated Friday evening, April 14th.
</p>
<p>" Some circumstances associated with this case help ex-
</p>
<p>hibit the character of the President. They will be stated
</p>
<p>briefly. As soon as Mr. Sumner had prepared his Opinion,
</p>
<p>he hurried to the President. It was late in the afternoon,
</p>
<p>and the latter was about entering his carriage for a drive,
</p>
<p>when Mr. Sumner arrived with the papers in his hand. He
</p>
<p>at once mentioned the result he had reached, and added
</p>
<p>that it was a case for instant action. The President pro-
</p>
<p>posed that he should return the next day, when he would
</p>
<p>consider it wath him. Mr. Sumner rejoined, that, in his
</p>
<p>opinion, the President ought not to sleep on the case  that
</p>
<p>he should interfere promptly for the relief of innocent fellow
</p>
<p>citizens  and urged that, if Abraham Lincoln had suffered
</p>
<p>unjust imprisonment, an immense bill of expense, a trial by
</p>
<p>court-martial, and an unjust condemnation, he would cry
</p>
<p>out against any postponement of justice for a single day.
</p>
<p>The President, apparently impressed by Mr. Sumner's
</p>
<p>earnestness and his personal appeal, appointed eleven
</p>
<p>o'clock that evening, when he would go over the case, and
</p>
<p>hear Mr. Summer's Opinion.
</p>

</p>
<p>midst of a thunder-storm, filling the streets with water,
</p>
<p>and threatening chimneys, Mr. Sumner made his way to
</p>
<p>the Presidential mansion. At the very hour named he was
</p>
<p>received, and at the request of the President proceeded to
</p>
<p>read his Opinion. The latter listened attentively, with
</p>
<p>56
</p>
<p>occasional comments, and at the close showed his sympathy
</p>
<p>with the respondents. It was now twenty minutes after mid-
</p>
<p>night, when the President said that he would write his con-
</p>
<p>clusion at once, and that Mr. Sumner must come and hear
</p>
<p>it the next morning  "when I open shop," said he. ''And
</p>
<p>when do you open shop?" Mr. Sumner inquired. "At
</p>
<p>nine o'clock," was the reply. At that hour Mr. Sumner
</p>
<p>was in the office he had left after midnight, when the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent came running in, and read at once the indorsement in
</p>
<p>his own handwriting, as follows :
</p>
<p>THE VINDICATION BY PRESIDENT LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>"/ am unwilling for ihe sentence to stand and be executed, to any
</p>
<p>extent, in this case. In the absence of a more adequate motive than the
</p>
<p>evidence discloses, I am wholly unable to believe in the existence of
</p>
<p>criminal or fraudulent intent on the part of one of such well-established
</p>
<p>good character as is the accused. If the evidence went as far toward
</p>
<p>establishing a guilty profit of one or two hundred thousand dollars, as it
</p>
<p>does of one or two hundred dollars, the case would, on the question of
</p>
<p>guilt, bear a far different aspect. That on this contract, involving from
</p>
<p>one million to twelve hundred thousand dollars, the contractors should
</p>
<p>attempt a fraud which at the most could profit them only one or two
</p>
<p>hundred, or even one thousand dollars, is to my mind beyond the power
</p>
<p>of rational belief. That they did not, in such a case, strike for greater
</p>
<p>gains proves that they did not, with guilty or fraudulent intent, strike at
</p>
<p>all. The judgment and sentence are disapproved and declared null, and
</p>
<p>the accused ordered to be discharged.
</p>
<p>"A. LINCOLN.

<p>PUBLIC DOCUMENTS AND THE PRESS
</p>
<p>1864=1865.
</p>
<p>From the Speech of HON. JOHN P. HALE in the United States
</p>
<p>Senate, Febi^uary, 1865.
</p>
<p>' ' There was a committee appointed by the Senate at the
</p>
<p>last session to investigate matters connected with naval
</p>
<p>supplies. The committee attended to that duty very
</p>
<p>laboriously ; and they laid some results before the Senate
</p>
<p>and before the country which, I think, were most conclu-
</p>
<p>sive as to the existence of gross fraud. Well, sir, do you
</p>
<p>knov/ what the result of that was ? One of the material
</p>
<p>witnesses in that case  one of the most respectable men of
</p>
<p>Boston, who testified, and testified very fully, before that
</p>
<p>committee  pretty soon after he went home, was seized,
</p>
<p>his store seized, his papers seized, his wife's papers seized ;
</p>
<p>and he was sent to a military fort, and ordered not to be
</p>
<p>released under a bail of $500,000, and was ordered to
</p>
<p>Philadelphia for trial. That was a little too strong even
</p>
<p>for the city of Boston, considering that, to render the thing
</p>
<p>more notorious, the arrest was made on the 17th of June."
</p>
<p>In reply to the question of Senator Davis, who asked :
</p>
<p>"If the offense for which that gentleman was seized and
</p>
<p>imprisoned was merely that of giving in his testimony and
</p>
<p>his exposure of those frauds." Mr. Hale declared :
</p>
<p>' ' That is my opinion ; but it was not the assigned cause.
</p>
<p>They ordered him, as I have said, to be confined in Fort
</p>
<p>Warren, and not to be released under $500,000 bail ; and
</p>
<p>he was ordered to Philadelphia for trial. This was a little
</p>
<p>too much for the loyal city of Boston ; and it created such
</p>
<p>indignation there that a delegation of citizens of Massachu-

</p>
<p>setts  I think the honorable Senator on my left (Mr.
</p>
<p>Sumner), was one of them  represented this thing to the
</p>
<p>President ; and the President countermanded the order for
</p>
<p>carrying a citizen of Massachusetts from Boston to Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia for trial."
</p>
<p>Speaking of courts-martial, Mr. Hale said, in the Senate :
</p>
<p>" And in that connection, I have a remarkable statement to
</p>
<p>make in regard to these tribunals. The man who ordered
</p>
<p>this outrageous arrest  the man who perpetrated this out-
</p>
<p>rage in Boston  compared to which the proceedings of
</p>
<p>Turkey are civilized, and the Inquisition is a tender mercy
</p>
<p> being remonstrated with, on another occasion, against
</p>
<p>sending these cases to naval and military courts-martial,
</p>
<p>and being asked why he did not take the ordinary courts,
</p>
<p>made this remarkable avowal : ' Your civil courts are
</p>
<p>orgmiized to acquit; we organize courts toco7ivict!^ If
</p>
<p>there was some friend of the individual referred to here to
</p>
<p>deny it, without stirring out of my tracks, I would prove,
</p>
<p>by evidence that would flash conviction on every mind that
</p>
<p>heard it, that it is true as Holy Writ that this declaration
</p>
<p>was made, and not only made, but acted upon."
</p>
<p>Speech of HON. H. L DA IVES, March 14, 1865.
</p>
<p>' ' I understand from high authority in the Navy Depart-
</p>
<p>ment, that courts-martial are not organized, like courts of
</p>
<p>law, to guard the rights of the accused and secure justice,
</p>
<p>but are organized to convict."
</p>
<p>Still again, and referring to this very case : "I have in
</p>
<p>the last fortnight had the painful duty devolved upon me
</p>
<p>to read the proceedings of a court-martial under the law
</p>
<p>which I reported to the House some two years ago. It is
</p>
<p>one which, I venture to say, has hardly a parallel for the
</p>
<p>bitter malignity which seems to run through the whole pro-

<p>ceedings, and for wider departure from old and established
</p>
<p>61
</p>
<p>rules of law, of which the accused were the victims, and by
</p>
<p>which they were hunted, since the days of Jeffreys. It is
</p>
<p>the case of Smith Brothers of Boston. If every charge
</p>
<p>alleged before the court-martial were taken to be true, just
</p>
<p>as alleged, they would only have been in default, in tran-
</p>
<p>sactions covering a business of more than twelve hundred
</p>
<p>thousand dollars, and the furnishing of thousands of differ-
</p>
<p>ent articles, barely twenty-two hundred dollars, and with-
</p>
<p>out anything which deserves the name of evidence that this
</p>
<p>paltry default was intentional. ' '
</p>
<p>Editorial from the "BOSTON JOURNAL/' February 14, 1865.
</p>
<p>' ' The case of the Smith Brothers, which has been on
</p>
<p>trial before a court-martial for several months past, is one
</p>
<p>which will now demand the attention and examination of
</p>
<p>the public, and probably of the President and Congress.
</p>
<p>We doubt whether in the course of the war, individuals 
</p>
<p>citizens whose loyalty is unimpeached  have been more
</p>
<p>harshly dealt with, or more persistently and cruelly perse-
</p>
<p>cuted. All the constitutional and legal safe-guards which,
</p>
<p>under our Repubhcan government, have been thrown around
</p>
<p>individual liberty, have in their case been broken down,
</p>
<p>and under no despotic government have those who have
</p>
<p>fallen under the ban of the ruling powers been more sum-
</p>
<p>marily dealt with, or held in a grasp of more relentless
</p>
<p>severity."
</p>
<p>' ' The public will naturally inquire how and in what
</p>
<p>quarter this persecution originated ? Two years ago
</p>
<p>Franklin W. Smith exposed and broke up an existing con-
</p>
<p>tract system which opened a wide door for frauds. In his
</p>
<p>illustrations of the working of the system it was shown that
</p>
<p>some of those employed in the bureaus of the Navy De-
</p>
<p>partment must have been in collusion with swindling con-

<p>tractors. From that time the persecution commenced.

</p>
<p>Editorial from "BOSTON DAILY ADVERTISER,"
</p>
<p>March 21, 1865.
</p>
<p>"The result of the great case of the Smith Brothers,
</p>
<p>naval contractors, charged with fraud, is at last before the
</p>
<p>public. After preliminary proceedings, which had seemed
</p>
<p>to point to disclosures of astounding magnitude, and after
</p>
<p>a thorough investigation of the business of the defendants,
</p>
<p>whose books and private papers were searched by experts
</p>
<p>for the materials for a prosecution, the charges brought
</p>
<p>against them finally settled down to an amount not much
</p>
<p>exceeding $2,000, while the charges relied upon against
</p>
<p>them scarcely reached the sum of $500." ^^ * "The
</p>
<p>President has reviewed the case and has annulled the judg-
</p>
<p>ment, thus setting his condemnation not only upon this
</p>
<p>extraordinary sentence, but upon the judgment itself, by
</p>
<p>which, after their case had so shrunk from its original sup-
</p>
<p>posed dimensions, the accused were convicted at all. The
</p>
<p>upshot of the matter is, that after all the immense parade
</p>
<p>and excitement with which this case began, it hums out that
</p>
<p>there is nothing in it. The accused stand to-day not only
</p>
<p>free from all charges, but with evidence that after a search-
</p>
<p>ing examination of their course of business, no sound basis
</p>
<p>for charges could be found. They had, at the beginning,
</p>
<p>the confidence of the mercantile community in which their
</p>
<p>lives have been passed ; they now have its indignant sym-
</p>
<p>pathy also. ' '
</p>
<p>"The arrest of the Smith Brothers was, made in June,
</p>
<p>1864. It was marked by every circumstance that could
</p>
<p>suggest the blackest criminality on their part. Had they
</p>
<p>been guilty of treason, the proceeding would have been
</p>
<p>deemed severe ; it would have been thought unreasonable
</p>
<p>and even outrageous, had the charge been murder. " * *
</p>
<p>' ' And all this, as now only too certainly appears, was done
</p>
<p>upon a venture. Those instigating and responsible for the

<p>proceedings, may have thought it likely that something of
</p>
<p>importance might thus be discovered, but they plainly had
</p>
<p>nothing of consequence to base their action upon. Every
</p>
<p>constitutional safeguard of personal rights  freedom from
</p>
<p>unreasonable searches and seizures and from excessive bail
</p>
<p>63
</p>
<p> was disregarded, not from any necessity, but to see what
</p>
<p>might come of it, and what disclosures might result from a
</p>
<p>blow thus struck at random. The whole unlimited authority
</p>
<p>with which the people have temporarily intrusted their gov-
</p>
<p>ernment to meet the terrible exigencies of civil war was put
</p>
<p>forth, and all, not only without necessity, but as it appears
</p>
<p>upon grounds which would not justify detention over night.
</p>
<p>" Upon these proceedings followed a tedious and costly
</p>
<p>trial, the amount involved in which would not pay for the
</p>
<p>printing necessarily done by the accused ; ten times the
</p>
<p>amount would not reimburse either government or accused
</p>
<p>for their expenses. And now upon a review of the case by
</p>
<p>a senator, whose pains-taking and love of justice displayed
</p>
<p>in this case do him the highest honor, and by the President,
</p>
<p>who will see the rebellion crushed but not innocent citizens,
</p>
<p>the case has been upset, and the accused have escaped
</p>
<p>from the tremendous blow which was aimed at them. With
</p>
<p>less individual tenacity of purpose, less ample means at
</p>
<p>command and fewer friends, they could not have escaped,
</p>
<p>the whole power and authority of the United States being

<p>to believe, will engage the attention of Congress and will

</p>
<p>Senator Sumner's Review of the Case of the
</p>
<p>Smith Brothers.
</p>
<p>* ' We publish in the Supplement of this morning the able
</p>
<p>review, by Senator Sumner, of the case of Franklin W.
</p>
<p>Smith, which should be read by all who are interested in
</p>
<p>this extraordinary case. It will be seen by this paper that
</p>
<p>the case, when it left the Navy Department and was sub-
</p>
<p>mitted to the President, had little left but the tin charge.
</p>
<p>The Court swept away some of the charges, and the Solici-
</p>
<p>tor of the Navy Department, Mr. Eames, conceded that
</p>
<p>there was little or no basis for the others, except the tin
</p>
<p>charge. On that the prosecution fell back, and intrenched
</p>
<p>itself
</p>
<p>"This tin charge  this enormous crime for which two
</p>
<p>honorable merchants were summarily arrested, without any
</p>
<p>of the forms of civil law, their business broken up, and a
</p>
<p>large portion of their property swept away  involves the
</p>
<p>petty sum of $ioo ! But even this charge is completely
</p>
<p>riddled by Mr. Sum ner in his review, as it was effectually
</p>
<p>answered on the trial even by the testimony for the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, a part of which Mr. Sumner quotes. As Mr.
</p>
<p>Sumner pointedly remarks : ' At the slightest touch the
</p>
<p>whole case vanished into thin air, leaving nothing behind
</p>
<p>but the incomprehensible spirit in which it had its origin.' "

<p>"Franklin W. Smith & Brother, a well-known Boston

<p>of numerous classes of articles at the Charlestown Navy

</p>
<p>upwards of one niillio7i two hundred and fifty tkousa?id dol-

<p>Mr. Franklin W. Smith."
</p>
<p>" Fortunately for Mr. Smith, he had influential friends

<p>who have stood by him manfully. Messrs. Sumner, Gooch,

<p>Journal ; Messrs. Benjamin F. Thomas, C. R. Train and

<p>George P. Sanger, the able counsel for the defense, with

<p>''NEW YORK TRIBUNE," January 13, 1866.
</p>
<p>' ' The celebrated case of Franklin W. Smith & Brother
</p>
<p>was one of those which most largely helped to bring mili-
</p>
<p>tary tribunals into public contempt. Those two gentlemen
</p>
<p>were arrested and kept in confinement, their papers seized,
</p>
<p>their business destroyed, their reputation damaged, and a
</p>
<p>naval court-martial, ' organized to convict,' pursued them
</p>
<p>unrelentingly till a wiser and juster hand arrested the malice
</p>
<p>of their persecutors. It is known that President Lincoln,
</p>
<p>after full investigation of the case, annulled the whole pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings, but it is remarkable that until this week the
</p>
<p>actual record of his decision could never be obtained from
</p>
<p>the Navy Department. An exact copy is still withheld,
</p>
<p>but the following was presented on Wednesday to the Bos-
</p>
<p>ton Board of Trade as being very nearly the words of the
</p>
<p>late President :
</p>
<p>" ' Whereas, F>anklin W. Smith had transactions with
</p>
<p>the Navy Department to the amount of one million and a
</p>
<p>quarter of a million of dollars ; and, whereas, he had the
</p>
<p>chance to steal a quarter of a million, and was only charged
</p>
<p>with stealing twenty-two hundred dollars  and the question
</p>
<p>now is abdut his stealing a hundred  I don't believe he
</p>
<p>stole anything at all. Therefore, the record and findings
</p>
<p>are disapproved  declared null and void, and the defend-
</p>
<p>ants are fully discharged.'*
</p>
<p>" It would be difficult to sum up the rights and wrongs
</p>
<p>of the business more briefly than that, or to find a para-
</p>
<p>graph more characteristically and unmistakably^ Mr. Lin-
</p>
<p>coln's. The effect of the President's decision was not to
</p>
<p>pardon the Messrs. Smith  it was to make the proceedings
</p>
<p>against them void ab initio, to censure the Court, to annul
</p>
<p>its findings, to repair, so far as any remedy could repair,
</p>
<p>the atrocious injustice of the prosecution, and to restore the
</p>
<p>innocent defendants to the full enjoyment of that honorable

<p>The undersigned, Senators and Representatives in Con-

<p>attention to the proceedings initiated by the Navy Depart-
</p>

</p>
<p>of Boston, of the firm of Smith Brothers & Co., a much

<p>respected firm, which has hitherto enjoyed the confidence,

<p>personal and mercantile, of the community where they

<p>reside.

</p>
<p>71
</p>
<p>ceedings have already attracted much attention, and
</p>
<p>awakened corresponding feeling.
</p>
<p>These proceedings have seemed to be harsh, vindictive,
</p>
<p>and unnecessary.
</p>
<p>(i.) In the character of the arrest of Messrs. Smith,
</p>
<p>which was attended by circumstances of severity utterly
</p>
<p>unjustifiable.
</p>
<p>(2.) In requiring bonds to so large an amount as half a
</p>
<p>million of dollars. The fact that the parties in question
</p>
<p>easily obtained bonds for a much larger amount does not
</p>
<p>render this exaction of " excessive bail" less obnoxious to
</p>
<p>the requirements of the Constitution and of justice, or less
</p>
<p>indicative of the spirit in which these proceedings have
</p>
<p>been conducted.
</p>
<p>(3.) In the seizure of their books and papers, which are
</p>
<p>still detained, although regarded by their eminent counsel
</p>
<p>as important to their defense.
</p>
<p>(4.) In turning into a military offense what is more
</p>
<p>proper for a civil tribunal, and dragging these defendants
</p>
<p>before a court-martial.
</p>
<p>(5.) In transferring the proceedings from Boston, where
</p>
<p>the parties reside, and the transactions in question occurred,
</p>
<p>to Philadelphia ; thus increasing greatly the difficulties and
</p>
<p>the expense of the defense. This will be appreciated when
</p>
<p>it is understood that the witnesses are very numerous, and
</p>
<p>chiefly engaged in mercantile business, so that they cannot
</p>
<p>leave Boston without the neglect of their private interests.
</p>
<p>The undersigned, on reviewing these circumstances,
</p>
<p>which are so inconsistent with the administration of justice
</p>
<p>in its ordinary forms, have been at a loss to account for the
</p>
<p>spirit which has been manifested in the prosecution. II
</p>
<p>they look at the trivial character of most of the specifica-
</p>
<p>tions against the defendants, they are still more at a loss.
</p>
<p>It is difficult to account for such elaborate and persistent

</p>
<p>harshness, without yielding to the prevailing belief that
</p>
<p>other motives than the vindication of justice have entered
</p>
<p>into this case.
</p>
<p>The undersigned are not strangers to the fact, that one
</p>
<p>of these defendants, in the discharge of what he believed to
</p>
<p>be his duty as a good citizen, has, by correspondence and
</p>
<p>72
</p>
<p>testimony before committees of Congress, been brought into
</p>
<p>collision with officers of the Navy Department ; and there
</p>
<p>is too much reason to believe, that some of these officers
</p>
<p>have allowed themselves to be governed by personal feel-
</p>
<p>ings throughout these strange proceedings.
</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the undersigned most
</p>
<p>respectfully ask your assistance in securing justice to these
</p>
<p>defendants, according to the common course of proceedings
</p>
<p>at law. They are acquainted with the statute which pro-
</p>
<p>vides court-martial for contractors in certain cases, and they
</p>
<p>are unwilling to make any suggestion which shall interfere
</p>
<p>with its efficiency ; but they have no hesitation in saying,
</p>
<p>that such a statute, which was intended for extreme cases,
</p>
<p>should not be apphed to a case like the present, where,
</p>
<p>with a single exception, the questions are simply whether
</p>
<p>the defendants complied with their coiitrad, and therefore,
</p>
<p>from their nature, can be better considered by the ordinary
</p>
<p>tribunals, accustomed to such questions, than by a naval
</p>
<p>tribunal composed of officers who have no familiarity with
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>If the pending proceedings against the Messrs. Smith
</p>
<p>should be continued, there are two courses with regard to
</p>
<p>them which may be recommended :
</p>
<p>First, That they should be transferred at once to the
</p>
<p>United States Court in Massachusetts, and be placed under
</p>
<p>the direction of the learned Attorney of the United States
</p>
<p>for that district.
</p>
<p>Secondly, If the foregoing order is not deemed expedient,
</p>
<p>on the existing evidence, then a commission or commis-
</p>
<p>sioner might be appointed by the President to inquire into
</p>
<p>the circumstances attending the arrest of the defendants,
</p>
<p>and also into the nature of the charges against them, in
</p>
<p>order to ascertain and report if there is any sufficient reason
</p>
<p>for the singular harshness to which they have been already

<p>subjected, and also for the exceptional proceedings which
</p>
<p>have been instituted against them.
</p>
<p>But for the sake of justice, and to relieve the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment from all suspicion of undue harshness, the undersigned
</p>
<p>protest against the spirit in which these proceedings have
</p>
<p>been conducted, and appeal to you for such remedy as
</p>
<p>73
</p>
<p>shall seem best ; to the end that the public interests may be
</p>
<p>adequately protected without any sacrifice of the rights of
</p>
<p>the citizens, and without needless interference with the

<p>order of business. (Signed)

<p>August, 1864, GEORGE S. BOUTWELL,
</p>
<p>Exiraci from a Letter of HON. A. H. RICE.
</p>
<p>Bangor, Me., August 15, 1864.
</p>
<p>To the President ,
</p>
<p>I have no hesitation in saying, that the community in
</p>
<p>which Smith Brothers reside is quite unanimous in believing
</p>
<p>that they have committed no offence of a criminal or
</p>
<p>fraudulent character ; and that the proceedings which have
</p>
<p>been instituted against them are not only needlessly severe,
</p>
<p>but they are especially objectionable, on the ground that
</p>
<p>they inflict upon them irreparable injury, before they have
</p>
<p>been found guilty of any crime. Measures so extraordinary
</p>
<p>and severe naturally give the impression that the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment esteems them guilty of extraordinary crimes ; or else
</p>
<p>that the Government is using its authority and power, not
</p>
<p>for the protection, but for the destruction of private, indi-

<p>FARTHER EVIDENCE OF THE
</p>
<p>''ORIGIN OF THESE UNFORTUNATE PROCEEDINGS'
</p>
<p>IN THE
</p>
<p>MORTIFICATION AND REVENGE
</p>
<p>OF THE CHIEF OF THE BUREAU OF ORDNANCE OF THE U. 8. NAVY DEPARTMENT.
</p>
<p>The hostility of this official had already been indicated,
</p>
<p>resulting from the overruling of his decision by the um-
</p>
<p>pire in a matter of boiler iron. That settlement was
</p>
<p>effected on the 6th of February, 1 864.
</p>
<p>On the 25th of February, F. W. Smith was informed
</p>
<p>that this chief of bureau had asserted in his office in
</p>
<p>Washington that Smith Brothers had delivered Revely
</p>
<p>tin for Banca, and had offered to refund money ; a
</p>
<p>charge which the firm immediately denied. The chief
</p>
<p>replied, reiterating the charge and inclosing a voucher
</p>
<p>for 504^ pounds Banca tin at 56 cents, alleging that it
</p>
<p>was Revely, and demanding a refund of money.
</p>
<p>Smith Brothers replied :
</p>
<p>' ' We claim this was Banca, as described. You offer no
</p>
<p>''proof, but merely assume to the contrary. Any further
</p>
<p>* ' claim for restitution by us must be accompanied by proof
</p>
<p>''that the articles were not as described.
</p>
<p>* * " We called upon you to comply courteously with
</p>
<p>' ' your request for a copy of our paper upon ' purchases of
</p>
<p>* ' naval supplies. ' Conversation ensued, initiated spiritedly

</p>
<p>* ' by yourself, concerning the delivery of Revely tin for
</p>
<p>" Banca, though you disclaimed any insinuation upon
</p>
<p>" Smith Brothers.
</p>
<p>"Yet a scandalous perversion of this conversation
</p>
<p>" quickly followed us upon our return. This experience
</p>
<p>"will forbid further communication in future with the
</p>
<p>" bureau, except by writing.
</p>
<p>" It is appropriate to remark, under these circumstances,
</p>
<p>"that the important relations of government officers should
</p>
<p>"keep them free from defamatory gossip ; especially when
</p>
<p>"it is known that it has been traced from thence directly
</p>
<p>" to the public press.
</p>
<p>"We remain your obedient servants,
</p>
<p>"Smith Brothers & Co."
</p>
<p>Despite the offer of proof to the contrary, the chief
</p>
<p>maintained his charge as to the tin, and wrote Hon.
</p>
<p>John P. Hale, Chairman of the Senate Committee, to
</p>
<p>that effect on the 2ist of May, 1864.
</p>
<p>On the same date he attempted to '' make the wool
</p>
<p>fly " by testimony as follow^s :
</p>
<p>Question. " In your answer to the twelfth interrogatory
</p>
<p>you state that there was $100,000 worth of tin called Straits
</p>
<p>tin furnished for Banca tin and charged as Banca tin. Do
</p>
<p>you know of your knowledge whether Smith Brothers &
</p>
<p>Company ever delivered any tin for Banca that was not? "
</p>
<p>Answer. ' ' I have every reason to believe that they
</p>
<p>never delivered one single pound of Banca tin, although in
</p>
<p>one bill they charged Banca tin and delivered Straits tin."
</p>
<p>Subsequently the witness was asked :
</p>
<p>Question. "Were these interrogatories submitted to
</p>
<p>you some time ago by the Navy Department? "
</p>
<p>Answer. "They were not submitted to me by the Navy

<p>Department."
</p>
<p>79
</p>
<p>Question. ' ' You have seen them ? ' '
</p>
<p>Answer. " Yes, sir."
</p>
<p>Question. *' Where did you see them ? "
</p>
<p>Answer. "I prepared them myself, because I was told
</p>
<p>by the Navy Department that I should be sworn."
</p>
<p>Question. "Did you prepare your answer to them in
</p>
<p>writing before you came here? "
</p>
<p>Answer. " Yes, after having full knowledge of the facts,
</p>
<p>and after going over the whole business."
</p>
<p>The falsity of this testimony was finally established by
</p>
<p>the testimony of the naval officer, Inspector of Ordnance at
</p>
<p>the Navy Yard, and the personal friend of the chief, as
</p>
<p>admitted in evidence, by testimony as follows, from the
</p>
<p>recofd:
</p>
<p>" In my examination to-day I have found a requisition
</p>
<p>"that was supplied by Smith Brothers, of Banca tin. May
</p>
<p>" i6, 1863. Banca tin was furnished by Smith Brothers
</p>
<p>" on that occasion. I know it to be Banca tin. There
</p>
<p>" were 504^ pounds at 56 cents, Banca tin."
</p>
<p>This swift witness was the author of the " dead-cock-
</p>
<p>in-the-pit " letter, of whom Senator Sumner wrote:
</p>
<p>"The writer of this letter, after appearing before the
</p>
<p>' * Senate Committee at a later day, came on from Washing-
</p>
<p>' ' ton to appear as a witness against the respondents at

<p>Interrogatory 26. To the question whether he had
</p>
<p>swurn to the statement cited, the witness answered : "It
</p>
<p>might be something similar to that. After this man read
</p>
<p>what was written, another man wrote on a piece of paper. "
</p>
<p>Interrogatory 27. " Did he not read it over to you after-

<p>ward ? ' '
</p>
<p>Answer. " He did, sir."
</p>
<p>Interrogatory 28. " And did you not sign it? "
</p>
<p>Answer. "Yes, sir ; I told him there were a great many
</p>
<p>things in that paper that were not right, and he said it was
</p>
<p>not anything very particular. I wanted to get it right.
</p>
<p>He wanted me to go down stairs and sign it, and I told a
</p>
<p>man down there I did not want to sign it."
</p>
<p>Answer. " I did not think it was right  anywhere near.
</p>
<p>He did not ask me any questions. I did not think that
</p>
<p>was right at the time."
</p>
<p>Interrogatory 38. " Wherein was it not right? "
</p>
<p>Answer. ' * Because he sat down and read it over, and

</p>
<p>wrote what he had a mind to, and I told him about a great
</p>
<p>many things, and he said it did not amount to anything.
</p>
<p>There were things there stated that there was nothing of
</p>
<p>truth in."
</p>
<p>Answer. " The objections that I made to signing that
</p>
<p>paper were, that he sat down there, and took and read off
</p>
<p>all his stuff, and if I said anything about it, he said that
</p>
<p>would not make any difference, and he read off what he
</p>
<p>wanted. He called another man to write, and I told him
</p>
<p>it was not right."
</p>
<p>Cross- Interrogatory 15 "Then this was it: one man
</p>
<p>dictated to another man what to write ; told him what to
</p>
<p>write ; the other man wrote down what the other directed
</p>
<p>to write ; and thereupon you were required to sign it. Is
</p>
<p>that so?"
</p>
<p>Answer. "That was so."
</p>
<p>Interrogatory. " Did you receive a message from this
</p>
<p>man, that if you did not produce your books they would
</p>
<p>come and take them by force? "
</p>
<p>Answer. "No; but he said so with his own mouth,
</p>
<p>with his own lips. When I was up there he said it."
</p>
<p>The witness added to his answer to the last question :
</p>
<p>" And he said that he would make me go to Washington."

<p>FALSIFICATIONS AND PERVERSIONS OF TESTIMONY
</p>
<p>BY JUDGKS-AOVOCAXK.
</p>
<p>From a Review of the Argument of the Judge-Advocate,
</p>
<p>by F. W. Smith.
</p>
<p>The Prefatory Note was as follows :
</p>
<p>The errors and perversions of testimony in the argu-
</p>
<p>ment of the judge-advocate, were so many and so gross,
</p>
<p>that it was thought expedient to notice a few of them.
</p>
<p>They might mislead those who had no opportunity to
</p>
<p>consult the record of the evidence.
</p>
<p>The engagements of my counsel being such that they
</p>
<p>could not give to the matter early attention, I have, at
</p>
<p>their solicitation, attempted the task myself
</p>
<p>>{c :{< :{c H< *
</p>
<p>I submit the result of this further effort to inform the
</p>
<p>public of the facts in the case, to the candid judgment
</p>
<p>of those who may be interested to examine it.
</p>
<p>F. W. S.
</p>
<p>Sixty-eight citations from the argument of the judge-
</p>
<p>advocate were compared with the stenographic record
</p>
<p>of the court, to illustrate the reckless falsification and
</p>
<p>perversion of the testimony. This review was mailed to
</p>
<p>all members of Congress and to the revising counsel of
</p>
<p>the Navy Department ; after its receipt he abandoned
</p>
<p>all charges save the one hundred dollers on tin.

</p>
<p>The introduction to the document (144 pages octavo),
</p>
<p>is as follows :
</p>
<p>On the nth day of January, 1865, the one hundred
</p>
<p>and thirteenth day from the commencement of the hear-
</p>
<p>ing, Judge-Advocate Smith concluded his reply to the
</p>
<p>argument of counsel for the defense. The most sacred
</p>
<p>interests of the respondent were now to be adjudicated,
</p>
<p>not by the unanimous decision of twelve of his fellow-
</p>
<p>citizens, but by the vpte of four among seven naval
</p>
<p>officers, from distant sections of the country, appointed
</p>
<p>by the accusing party, and sworn to secrecy as to their
</p>
<p>respective judgments; the judges-advocate remaining
</p>
<p>with the court.
</p>
<p>This is a feature of courts-martial peculiarly abhor-
</p>
<p>rent to our sense of justice, that when they have had the
</p>
<p>last word in argument^ however unjust in spirit or untrue
</p>
<p>in statement the judges-advocate are present at the pri-
</p>
<p>vate deliberations of those acting as judge and jury, de-
</p>
<p>ciding upon both law and fact.
</p>
<p>From among more than Jive thousand business and
</p>
<p>private letters and copies of letters, forcibly seized from
</p>
<p>Smith Brothers & Co., and subject to the scrutiny of
</p>
<p>detectives for months, there were but two which could
</p>
<p>be perverted to their apparent injury, except that, upon
</p>
<p>the misinterpretation of which, the specification as to
</p>
<p>Sterling iron was based.
</p>
<p>It is, therefore, necessary to refute these insinuations ;

</p>
<p>of Smith Brothers & Co. upon the record of the hearing,

<p>The final recapitulation of arguments in defense from

<p>the Review was prefaced as follows :

<p>The defendant asks for an impartial judgment upon
</p>
<p>the record of his defense ; the record being viewed in
</p>
<p>the light of all surrounding circumstances.
</p>
<p>A BUSINESS OF $1,250,000, covering an almost infinite
</p>
<p>variety of detail, prosecuted at a period of unprecedented
</p>
<p>excitement in the business world ; of scarcity of mer-
</p>
<p>chandise, of financial panic and uncertainty ; a business
</p>
<p>involving inevitably the " work of other men's hands,"
</p>
<p>and reliance upon other men's faithfulness  this business
</p>
<p>hunted, pried into, from March until September, by a
</p>
<p>secret detective inquisition that called before it more
</p>
<p>than one hundred different parties to be probed and
</p>
<p>catechised ; an inquisition that in June, under military
</p>
<p>authority, seized all the business and private books,
</p>
<p>papers and correspondence of the firm from warehouse
</p>
<p>and dwellings, that had then all original letters, invoices,
</p>
<p>and entries under its hand, by which it could trace every
</p>
<p>transaction from its inception to its conclusion, its profit,
</p>
<p>its payment ; that called to its aid accountant experts to
</p>
<p>fathom the ledgers and cash books ; this business, thus

<p>DISSECTED AND ANALYZED WITH HOSTILE INTENT, AS NEVER

<p>SUPPRESSION OF THE BUSINESS OF SMITH BROTHERS

</p>
<p>Prices Increased 33 1-3 Per Cent.
</p>
<p>The military seizure of the warehouse of Smith
</p>
<p>Brothers & Co. was at the precise period of advertise-
</p>
<p>ment for annual supplies. Although the inquisition had
</p>
<p>been in session three months in Boston, no charges were
</p>
<p>preferred until a month after the pillage of their premises
</p>
<p>and the paralysis of their business, at a great loss.
</p>
<p>Many papers have never been recovered.
</p>
<p>Thus, when it had been found that official opposition
</p>
<p>and annoyance would not drive them from the field, the
</p>
<p>war power was invoked, their business wrested from
</p>
<p>them, and all their resources of mental endurance and
</p>
<p>pecuniary strength demanded in defense from utter ruin.
</p>
<p>Then, upon the award of new contracts, men who had
</p>
<p>solicited them to participate in bribery, and had been
</p>
<p>repelled, succeeded to government patronage. 
</p>
<p>So great was the shock to the business community by
</p>

<p>SUPPRESSION OF THE DECISION OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN
</p>
<p>BY SECRETARY WELLES, FOR FOUR YEARS,
</p>
<p>DURING THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESI DENT JOH NSON.
</p>
<p>REVISION OF THE VERDICT OF THE COURT
</p>
<p>BY COUNSEL OF THE NAVY DEPARTMENT.
</p>
<p>Upon the annulment of the case by President Lincoln,
</p>
<p>there was great public interest to know the precise terms
</p>
<p>of his decision. His assassination followed immediately ;
</p>
<p>and it was supposed that the promulgation of his dis
</p>
<p>approval was simply overlooked in the direful excitement
</p>
<p>of that tragedy. Meanwhile, it was reported that the
</p>
<p>endorsement of the President was remarkably quaint
</p>
<p>and characteristic ; and a humorous version of it was
</p>
<p>published throughout the country. (V. Ex. N. Y.
</p>
<p>Tribune)
</p>
<p>At length Senator Sumner, in behalf of Mr. Smith,
</p>
<p>called upon the Secretary of the Navy for an official
</p>
<p>copy of the record. To his astonishment and indigna-
</p>
<p>tion it was refused by the Secretary, on the ground that
</p>
<p>it was his duty to shield the court from further repre-
</p>
<p>hension. A lengthy correspondence ensued, Mr. Sum-
</p>
<p>ner claiming that the record was not only of right the
</p>
<p>property of Mr. Smith, but also of the public. Tired of
</p>
<p>conflict, the respondent in the case decided to await
</p>
<p>Secretary Welles' retirement from office.

</p>
<p>Not until 1869 did he have access to the record ol
</p>
<p>the court, in the archives of the Navy Department. It
</p>
<p>may be seen on their shelves, in ten massive volumes
</p>
<p>folio ; by far the most voluminous and, consequently,
</p>
<p>most expensive record of a court-martial since the foun-
</p>
<p>dation of the government.
</p>
<p>Extraordinary details are revealed in that record, that
</p>
<p>will have yet a more full compilation. This summary
</p>
<p>relates more to a personal vindication than to the great
</p>
<p>public importance of the case ; which was impressively
</p>
<p>set forth by Judge Parker in his last lecture as Professor
</p>
<p>of the Harvard Law School.*
</p>
<p>Following the record of the court is the opinion of
</p>
<p>the reviser of the department. It labors to sustain the
</p>
<p>warrant for the case, but as President Lincoln said of it
</p>
<p>to Senator Sumner, he is compelled to abandon all alle-
</p>
<p>gations for this intensely fought prosecution, except the
</p>
<p>'' sure thing 071 the tin'' mvoWing less than ;^ioo. He
</p>
<p>decided as follows :
</p>
<p>*" Smith Brothers & Co., of Boston, were contractors for sup-
</p>
<p>plies for the use of the Navy Department."
</p>
<p>"Their real offense seems to have been that they refused to
</p>
<p>become participators in frauds upon the government."
</p>
<p>******
</p>
<p>" The trial was of great length, but the charges were all tri-
</p>
<p>umphantly met and refuted."
</p>
<p>5- -X- * * ^ -K-
</p>
<p>" The President committed the case to a Senator for a report,
</p>
<p>who justly and properly exonerated Messrs. Smith from all blame,
</p>
<p>and the President disapproved of the proceedings, perhaps in
</p>
<p>terms not very complimentary to the court, or others who were
</p>
<p>active in promoting the prosecution."  Lectures on the three

<p>First. The finding of the court on tin was "justified."
</p>
<p>Secoyid. The finding of the court on emery cloth, less
</p>
<p>clearly made out, and less important.
</p>
<p>Third. "The same observation is, in my judgment,
</p>
<p>"applicable to the third specification under both charges.
</p>
<p>"The delivery of inferior articles is very small in compari-
</p>
<p>"son with the whole quantity delivered under the contract,
</p>
<p>"and may well have happened through inadvertence."
</p>
<p>Secretary Welles had good need to protect his court not
</p>
<p>only from further "public reprehension," but ridicule, in
</p>
<p>view of the record to which the seven old naval officers
</p>
<p>attached their verdict of
</p>
<p>' * * Proven, ' as to 24 single articles of hardware in a con-
</p>
<p>tract for 12,564 single articles ; and ' not proven' as to the
</p>
<p>others. ' '
</p>
<p>At this point the verdict of the Boston Board of Trade
</p>
<p>is apposite :
</p>
<p>"In view of such facts, the charge of 'fraud' or ol
</p>
<p>' ' fraudulent intention is utterly frivolous. The wonder
</p>
<p>"indeed is, that in so large a business, and in the condi-
</p>
<p>" tion of the market since the beginning of the war, the
</p>
<p>"number of articles below the standard quality should be
</p>
<p>"so very limited. Of the general good quality of the
</p>
<p>"goods and wares sold and delivered, there can be no
</p>
<p>' * doubt. ' '  Report of Special Committee.
</p>
<p>Fourth. ' ' * Not proven '  obviously correct and proper. ' '
</p>
<p>Fifth and Sixth. "Stricken out by the court."
</p>
<p>Seve7ith. * * The exclusion of testimony offered by the de-
</p>
<p>fense was an error in law and in derogation of his right."
</p>
<p>These were the conclusions by the counsel of the con-
</p>
<p>spirators, from 2,500 pages of testimony, gathered after
</p>
<p>a year of inquisition and court-martial ; at a cost to the
</p>
<p>government of at least ;^40,ooo ; to the respondents, in

</p>
<p>96
</p>
<p>This will be accepted as within the fact, when it is
</p>
<p>realized that the defendant's business, established in
</p>
<p>Boston and New York, after twenty years of enterprise,
</p>
<p>was utterly destroyed by the onslaught; all books and
</p>
<p>papers being held for the period of nine months from
</p>
<p>their seizure, and the utmost powers of mental and
</p>
<p>physical endurance being demanded in defense of all
</p>
<p>that could make life desirable. Not only were all busi-
</p>
<p>ness facilities collapsed by the blow, but the defendant
</p>
<p>could only recover mental poise and strength to re-enter
</p>
<p>upon the activities of life by absolute retirement to the
</p>
<p>quiet of rural pursuits.
</p>
<p>The sense of outrage at the above revision of the
</p>
<p>counsel of the Navy Department, sent by President
</p>
<p>Lincoln to Senator Sumner for his review, prompted his
</p>
<p>emphatic indignation :

</p>
<p>THE GAIN TO GOVERNMENT
</p>
<p>UPON
</p>
<p>CONTRACTS WITH SMITH BROTHERS.
</p>
<p>Extract from Report of the Boston Board of Trade.
</p>
<p>" Bandaged eyes and even scales are the emblems of
</p>
<p>justice. Before a civil tribunal, State or Federal, our
</p>
<p>Associate would have been tried on a suit of co7itract by a
</p>
<p>judge of high legal attainments, who would have co7ifined
</p>
<p>the evidence to the case ; and who would have decided to
</p>
<p>admit or reject testimony after arguments of counsel, and in
</p>
<p>the presence of both parties to the issue. And non-perform-
</p>
<p>ance proved, the jury would have returned a verdict of
</p>
<p>damages in dollars and cents ; and (no appeal), here the
</p>
<p>matter would have terminated. Justice is even-handed
</p>
<p>between individuals, and should be so between govern-
</p>
<p>ments and citizens. For the first time, and upon this point,
</p>
<p>we quote from Mr. Smith's ' Review of the argument of the
</p>
<p>Judge Advocate,' thus :
</p>
<p>" The loss of interests to Smith Brothers & Co. has not
</p>
<p>been less than two per cent, upon their sales, through the
</p>
<p>delinquency of government payment ; or $25,000 on
</p>
<p>$1,250,000; although the early contracts stipulated that
</p>
<p>payments ' will be paid by the Navy Agent within thirty
</p>
<p>days after bills, duly authenticated, shall have been pre-
</p>
<p>sented to him.' "
</p>
<p>Again :
</p>
<p>* ' It required energy and caution to prevent these con-
</p>
<p>tracts from being disastrous. Many were abandoned by
</p>
<p>other parties on account of losses involved, and relief bills
</p>
<p>were passed by Congress for contractors ; but Smith

<p>Brothers <& Co. strove to fulfil their contracts with the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment (as with all men), up to the time of the violent
</p>
<p>proceedings against them  contracts on which the advance
</p>
<p>realized to the government ivas certainly not less than
</p>
<p>$200,000.''
</p>
<p>' ' The ' advance ' was for the benefit of the country ;
</p>
<p>but, on the other hand, the country should, as ' between
</p>
<p>man and wife,' make good the 'loss,' whether much or lit-
</p>
<p>tle ; because the country is not entitled (in popular phrase),
</p>
<p>to ' both sides of the bargain.' The result, then, on this
</p>
<p>branch of our inquiry is, that on a question of contract,
</p>
<p>Franklin W. Smith, and not the Government,
</p>
<p>is the party entitled to a verdict eor damages.
</p>
<p>Smith Brothers contracted for 3,000 tons of pig-iron,
</p>
<p>for shot and shell, at an average of about twenty-five
</p>
<p>dollars per ton. Before the delivery was completed the
</p>
<p>value advanced to forty-tw^o dollars per ton ; making a
</p>
<p>gain to the Government of more than forty thousand
</p>
<p>dollars ; but fully this sum was revengefully wasted
</p>
<p>upon their persecution.
