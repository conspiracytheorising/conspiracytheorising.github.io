<p>AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO RICHELIEU.
</p>
<p>The administration of Cardinal Richelieu, whom (despite
</p>
<p>ell his darker qualities,) Voltaire and History justly eonsi*
</p>
<p>der the true architect of the French monarchy, and the
</p>
<p>great parent of French civilization, is characterized by fea-
</p>
<p>tures alike tragic and comic. A weak king  an ambitious
</p>
<p>favourite ; a despicable conspiracy against the minister,
</p>
<p>nearly always associated with a dangerous. treason against
</p>
<p>the State  these, with little variety of names and dates,
</p>
<p>constitute the eventful cycle through which, with a dazzling
</p>
<p>ease, and an arrogant confidence, the great luminary fulfilled
</p>
<p>its destinies. Blent together, in startling contrast, we see
</p>
<p>the grandest achievements and the pettiest agents ;  the
</p>
<p>spy  the mistress  the capuchin ;  the destruction of feu-
</p>
<p>dalism ; the humiliation of Austria ;  the dismemberment
</p>
<p>of Spain.
</p>
<p>Richelieu himself is still what he was in his own day  a
</p>
<p>man of two characters. If, on the one hand, he is justly
</p>
<p>represented as inflexible and vindictive, crafty and unscrupu-
</p>
<p>lous ; so, on the other, it cannot be denied that he was
</p>
<p>placed in times in which the long impunity of every license
</p>
<p>required stern examples  ^that he was beset by perils and in-
</p>
<p>trigues, which gave a certain excuse to the subtlest inven-
</p>
<p>tions of self-defence  that his ambition was inseparably conr
</p>
<p>nee ted with a passionate love for the glory of his country 
</p>
<p>and that, if he was her dictator, he was not less her bene-
</p>
<p>factor. It has been fairly remarked by the most impartial
</p>
<p>historians, that he was no less generous to merit than severe
</p>
<p>to crime  that, in the various departments of the State, the
</p>
<p>Anny, and the Church, he selected and distinguished the
</p>
<p>ablest aspirants  that the wars which he conducted were,
</p>
<p>for the most part, essential to the preservation of France,

</p>
<p>and Europe itself, from the formidable encroachments of the
</p>
<p>Austrian House  that, in spite of those wars, the people
</p>
<p>were not oppressed with exhorbitant imposts  and that he
</p>
<p>left the kingdom he had governed in a more flourishing and
</p>
<p>vigorous state than at any former period of the French hia*
</p>
<p>tory, or at the decease of Louis XIY.
</p>
<p>The cabels formed against the great statesman were not
</p>
<p>carried on by the patriotism of public virtue, nor the emula-
</p>
<p>tion of equal talent ; they were but court struggles, in
</p>
<p>which the most worthless agents had recourse to the most
</p>
<p>desperate means.  In each, as I have before observed, we
</p>
<p>see combined the twofold attempt to murder the minister,
</p>
<p>and to betray the country. Such, then, are the agents, and
</p>
<p>such the designs, with which truth, in the Drama, as in His-
</p>
<p>tory, requires us to contrast the celebrated Cardinal ; not
</p>
<p>disguising his foibles or his vices, but not unjust to the
</p>
<p>grander qualities (especially the love of country,) by which
</p>
<p>they were often dignified, and, at times, redeemed.
</p>
<p>The historical drama is the concentration of historical
</p>
<p>events. In the attempt to place upon the stage the picture
</p>
<p>of an era, that license with dates and details, which Poetry
</p>
<p>permits, and which the highest authorities in the Drama of
</p>
<p>France herself, have sanctioned, has been, though not un-
</p>
<p>sparingly, indulged. The conspiracy of the Due de Bouillon
</p>
<p>is, for instance, amalgamated with the denouncement of the
</p>
<p>Day of Dupes ; and circumstances connected with the trea-
</p>
<p>son of Cinq-Mars (whose brilUant youth and gloomy catas-
</p>
<p>trophe tend to subvert poetic and historic justice, by seduc-
</p>
<p>ing us to forget his base ingratitude and his perfidious apos-
</p>
<p>tacy,) are identified with the fate of the earlier favourite
</p>
<p>Baradas, whose sudden rise and as sudden fall passed into a
</p>
<p>proverb. I ought to add, that the noble romance of Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars suggested one of the scenes in the fifth act ; and that
</p>
<p>for the conception of some portion of the intrigue connected
</p>
<p>with De Mauprat and Julie, I am with great alterations of
</p>
<p>incident, and considerable if not entire reconstruction of

<p>character, indebted to an early and admirable novel bv the
</p>
<p>author of Picdola.
</p>
<p>London, March, 1839.
</p>
<p>EDITORIAL INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>The play of Richelieu is far the most elaborate of Mr
</p>
<p>Bulwer's dramatic productions. It was originally per
</p>
<p>formed, March 7th, 1839, at the Covent Garden Theatre,
</p>
<p>to an overflowing house  ^Macready appearmg as the Cardi-
</p>
<p>nal and Miss Helen Fancit as Julie. It was put on the
</p>
<p>stage with every possible advantage of scenery and costume,
</p>
<p>and efficiently sustained throughout, in all its characters, by
</p>
<p>an excelle'^t company. Its success was remarkably briUiant ;
</p>
<p>and, for a leries of nights, it drew crouded and delighted
</p>
<p>audiences.
</p>
<p>The author seems to have been partially indebtet for his
</p>
<p>materials, to the historical novels of Alfred de Yigny, from
</p>
<p>whose admirable picture of the character of Richelieu, in
</p>
<p>" Cinq-Mars," he has borrowed some leading traits. He
</p>
<p>acknowledges his obligations to these and other sources in
</p>
<p>his preface. The original merits of the play, however, are
</p>
<p>obvious and great ; and it may be regarded as one of the
</p>
<p>most unexceptionable modern contributions to the English
</p>
<p>Standard Drama. It abounds in passages of great beauty,
</p>
<p>nd of a high order of poetry.
</p>
<p>Simultaneously with its appearance in England, the play
</p>
<p>was received in this country by Mr. Forrest, to whom it
</p>
<p>nad been consigned by Mr. Bulwer, to be introduced upon
</p>
<p>the American Stage. It is unnecessary for us to say, with
</p>
<p>what abihty the task was performed by our great tragedian.
</p>
<p>His personation of the old, high-spirited Cardinal, is alone
</p>
<p>Bui&cient to vindicate his claims to a lasting histrionic repur
</p>
<p>vation. It has never been surpassed  and to our mind,
</p>
<p>aever been equalled  ^by the most eminent of his cotemp>

<p>NOTE.
</p>
<p>The length of the Play necessarily requires curtailments on the Stage 
</p>
<p>the passages thus omitted are those inserted with inverted commas. Many
</p>
<p>of the passages thus left out, however immaterial to the. audience, must
</p>
<p>obviously be such as the reader would be least inclined to disi)ense with 
</p>
<p>viz : those which, without being absolutely essential to the business of the
</p>
<p>Stage, contain either the subtler strokes of character, or the more poetica.
</p>
<p>embellishments of description. A more important consequence of these
</p>
<p>suppressions is, that Richelieu himself is left too often, and too nnre-
</p>
<p>lievedly, to positions which place him in an amiaUe light, without that
</p>
<p>shadowing forth of his more sinister motives and his fiercer qualities

<p>which is attempted in the written play. Thus, the character takes a degree
</p>
<p>of credit due only to the situation. To judge the Author's conception of
</p>
<p>Richelieu fairly, and to estimate how far it is consistent with historical por-
</p>
<p>traitm*, the Play must be read.

<p>at which are seated Baradas, Four Courtiers sflmdidly dressed
</p>
<p>in tilt costume of 1641-2 ; the Duke of Orleans reclining on

<p>his chair, offers him a goblet and then retires. At another tahhy

</p>
<p>KOTES TO RICHELIEU.
</p>
<p>NOTES TO ACT 1.
</p>
<p>(1) Qlivares, Minister of Spain.
</p>
<p>(2) There are many anecdotes of the irony, often so terrible, in which
</p>
<p>Bichelieu indulged. But he had a love for humour in its more hearty anu
</p>
<p>genial shape. He would send for Boisrobert " to make him laugh,"  and
</p>
<p>grave ministers and magnates waited in the ante-room, while the great
</p>
<p>Cardinal listened and responded to the sallies of the lively wit.
</p>
<p>(3) The Abbe Amaud tells us that the queen was a little avenged on the
</p>
<p>Cardinal by the ill-success of the tragic comedy of Mirame  more than
</p>
<p>suspected to be his own  though presented to the world under the foster
</p>
<p>name of Desmarets. Its representation (savs Pelisson) cost him 300,000
</p>
<p>crowns. He was so transported out of himself by the performance, that at
</p>
<p>one time, he thrust his person half out of his box to show himself to the
</p>
<p>assembly ; at another time he imposed silence on the audience that they
</p>
<p>might not lose " dcs endroits encore plus beaux." He said afterwards to
</p>
<p>Desmarets ; " Eh bien, les Francais n'auront done jamais de gout. lis
</p>
<p>. n'ont pas ete charmes de 3Iirame !" Amand says pithily, " On ne pouvoit
</p>
<p>alors avoir d'autre satisfaction des offenses d'un nomme* qui etoit maitre de
</p>
<p>tout, et redoutable a tout le monde. " Nevertheless his style in prose,
</p>
<p>though not devoid of the pedantic affectations of the time, often rises into
</p>
<p>very noble eloquence.
</p>
<p>(4) " Vialart remarqne nnc chose qui pent expliquer la conduite de Ri-
</p>
<p>chelieu en d'autres circonstances ;  c est que les seigneurs k qui leur nais*
</p>
<p>sance ou leur merite pouvoit permettre des pretensions, il avoit pour sys-
</p>
<p>tfeme, de leur accorder au-delli meme de leurs droits et de leurs esp^rancea,
</p>
<p>mais, aussi, une fis combl^s  si, au lieu de reconnoitre ses services ils se

</p>
<p>tot's collection.

<p>(5) '* Tantot fonatique  tontot fourbe  fonder les religieuses de Calvairo
</p>
<p>faire des vers." Thus speaks Voltaire of Father Joseph. His talents
</p>
<p>and influence with Richelieu, grossly exaggerated in his own day, are now
</p>
<p>rightfully estimated.

<p>NOTES TO ACT H.
</p>
<p>(1) Richelieu not only employed the lowest, but would often consult men
</p>
<p>commonly esteemed the dullest. " D disoit que dans des choses de tret
</p>
<p>grande importance, il avail experiments, que les moins sages domoient
</p>
<p>souvent les meillieurs expedieus."  /^ CUrc.

</p>
<p>(2) Both Eic'J elieu and Joseph were originally int^ aded for the profe*
</p>
<p>rion of arms. Joseph had served before he obeyed ihe spiritual inspir>
</p>
<p>tion to become a Capuchin. The death of his brother opened to Richelieu
</p>
<p>the Bishopric of Lucon ; but his military propensities were as strong ai
</p>
<p>his priestly ambition. I need scarcely add that the Cardina', during his
</p>
<p>brilliant campaign in Italy, marched at the head of his troops in complete
</p>
<p>armour. It was under his administration that occurs the last example of pro-
</p>
<p>claiming war by the chivaMc defiance of herald and cartel. Richeliea
</p>
<p>valued himself much on his personal activity,  for his vanity was as uni-
</p>
<p>vereal as his ambition. A nobleman at the house of Grammout one day
</p>
<p>found him jmployed in jumping, and, with all the savoir vivre of a French-
</p>
<p>man aftd a courtier, offered to jump against him. lie suffered the Cardinal
</p>
<p>to jump higher, and soon after found himself rewarded by an appoint-
</p>
<p>ment. Yet, strangely enough, this vanity did not lead to a patronage in-
</p>
<p>jurious to the state ; for never before in France was ability made so es*
</p>
<p>sential a requisite in promotion. He was lucky in finding the cleverest
</p>
<p>fellows among his adroitest flatterers.
</p>
<p>(3) Voltaire openly charges Richelieu with being the lover of Marion de
</p>
<p>Lorme, whom the great poet of France, Victor Hugo, haa sacrificed His-
</p>
<p>tory to adorn with qualities which were cei-tainly not added to her personal
</p>
<p>charms.  She was not less perfidious than beautiful.  Le Clerc, properly,
</p>
<p>refutes the accusation of Voltaire, against the discretion of Richelieu;
</p>
<p>and says, very justly, that if the great minister had the frailties of humaa
</p>
<p>nature, he learnt how to veil them,  at least when he obtained the scarlet,
</p>
<p>in earlier life he had been prone to gallantries which a little prepossessed
</p>
<p>the King (who was formal and decorous, and threw a singular coldness
</p>
<p>into the few attachments he permitted to himself) against the aspiring ifl-
</p>
<p>triguer. But these gayer occupations died away in the engagement of
</p>
<p>higher pursuits or of darker passions.
</p>
<p>(4) Richelieu did in fact so thoroughly associate himself with the State,
</p>
<p>that, in cases where the extreme penalty of the law had been incurred, Le
</p>
<p>Clerc justly observes that he was more inexorable to those he had favom^ed
</p>
<p> even to his own connections  ^than to other and more indifferent offend-
</p>
<p>ers. It must be remembered as some excuse for his unrelenting sternness,

<p>that, before his time, the great had been accustomed to commit any dis-
</p>
<p>order with impunity  even the crime of treason, " auparavant on ne fais-
</p>
<p>oit poser les armes aux rebelles qu'en leur accordant quelque recompense."
</p>
<p>On entering into the administration, he therefore laid it down as a maxim
</p>
<p>necessary to the existence of the State, that " n crime should be com-
</p>
<p>mitted With impunity." To carry out this maxim, the long established li-
</p>
<p>cense to crime made even justice seem cruel. But the victims most com-
</p>
<p>ihisei*ated from their birth or accomplishments, as Montanorenci, or Cinq
</p>
<p>Mars were traitors in actual conspiracy against their country, and \>ould
</p>
<p>have forfeited life in any land where the punishment of death existed,
</p>
<p>and the lawgiver was strong enough to vindicate the law. Richelieu was
</p>
<p>in fact a patriot unsoftened by philantrophy. As in Venice (where the
</p>
<p>favourite aphorism was, Venice first, Christianity next,) so, with Richelieu
</p>
<p>the primary consideration was, " what will be the best for the Country ?"
</p>
<p>He had no abstract principle, whether as a politician or a priest, when
</p>
<p>applied to the world that lay beyond the boundaries of France. Thus he,
</p>
<p>whose object was to found in France a splendid and imperious despotism 
</p>
<p>assisted the Parliamentary party in England, and signed a treaty of al-
</p>
<p>liance and subsides with the Catalan rebels for the establishment of a
</p>
<p>Republic in Barcelona ;  to convulse other Monarchies was to consolidate
</p>
<p>the growing Monarchy of France. So he, who completely crashed the
</p>
<p>Protestant party at home, braved all the wi'ath of the Vatrcan, and etm

<p>thti resentment of the King, in giving the most essential aid to the Pro-
</p>
<p>testants abroad. There was, indeed, a largeness of view in his hostility
</p>
<p>to the French Hnguenots, which mnst be carefully distinguished from the
</p>
<p>intolerance of the mere priest. He opposed them, not as a Catholic, but as
</p>
<p>a Statesman. The Huguenots were strong republicans, and had formed
</p>
<p>plans for dividing France into provincial commonwealths ; and the exist-
</p>
<p>ence of Rochelle was absolutely incompatible with the integrity of the
</p>
<p>French Monarchy. It was a second capital held by the Huguenots, claim-
</p>
<p>ing independent authority, and the ri^ht to treat with Foreign Powers.
</p>
<p>Richelieu's final conquest was marked by a humanity, that had nothing of
</p>
<p>the bigot. The Huguenots obtained a complete amnestv, and had only to
</p>
<p>regret the loss of privileges and fortifications which could not have existed
</p>
<p>with anv security to the rest of France.
</p>
<p>(5) The guard attached to Richelieu's person waa, in the first instance,
</p>
<p>fifty arquebussiers, afterwards increased to two companies of cavalry and
</p>
<p>two hundred musqueteers. Huguet is, therefore, to be considered merely
</p>
<p>as the lieutenant of a small detachment of this little army. In point ot
</p>
<p>fact the subdivisions of the guard took it in turns to serve.
</p>
<p>(6) This tract, on the " Unity of the Minister," contains all the doc-
</p>
<p>trines, and many more to the same effect, referred to in the text, and had a
</p>
<p>prodigious influence on the conscience of the poor king. At the onset of
</p>
<p>nis cai-eer, Richelieu, as deputy of the clergy of Poitou, complained in his
</p>
<p>harangue to the king that ecclesiastics were too rarely summoned to the
</p>
<p>royal councils, and invoked the example of tiie Druids I
</p>
<p>(7) Joseph's ambition was not, however, so moderate ; he refused a
</p>
<p>bishopric, and desired the Cardinal's Hat, for which favour Richelieu
</p>
<p>openly supplicated the Holy See^ hut contrived, somehow or otJier, never
</p>
<p>to effect it, although two ambassadors applied for it at Rome.
</p>
<p>(8) The peculiar religion of Pere Joseph may be illustrated by the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing anecdote :  An officer, whom he had dismissed upon an expedition
</p>
<p>into Germany, moved by conscience at the orders he had received, returned
</p>
<p>for farther explanations, and found the Capuchin disant sa masse. He ap-
</p>
<p>proached and whispered " But, my father, if these people defend them-

<p>the reader however, the passages omitted in representation will not, per-

</p>
<p>BO subtly the place of words in the closet. The self-assured sophistriea

<p>Ihis self-confession lies the "atent poetical justice,  which separates "j^
</p>
<p>piness from success.
</p>
<p>[2] It is well known that when, on his death-bed, Richelieu was anked
</p>
<p>if he forgave his enemies, he replied, " I never had any, but those ot the
</p>
<p>state." And this was true enough, for Richelieu and the state ^ere
</p>
<p>one.
</p>
<p>[3] Richelieu's vindication of himself from cruelty will' be found in
</p>
<p>various parts of Petitot's Collection, vols. xxi. xxx.
</p>
<p>[4] Voltaire has a striking passage on the singular fate of Richelieu,
</p>
<p>recalled every hour from his gigantic schemes to frustrate some miserable
</p>
<p>cabal of the ante-ioom. Richelieu would often exclaim, that " Six pieds
</p>
<p>de terre [as he called the king's cabinet] lui donnaient plus de peine que
</p>
<p>tout le reste de I'Europe." The death of Wallenstein, sacrificed by the
</p>
<p>Emperor Ferdinand, produced a most lively impression upon Richelieu.
</p>
<p>Ho found many traits of comparison between Ferdinand and Louis  Wal-
</p>
<p>lenstein and himself. In the Memoirs  now regarded by the best authori-
</p>
<p>ties as written by his sanction, and in great part by himself  the great
</p>
<p>Frenchman bursts [when alluding to Wallenstein's murder j into a touch-
</p>
<p>ing and pathetic anathema on the misere de cette vie of deper.dence on jea-
</p>
<p>.oas and timid royalty, which he himself, while he wrote, sustained. It is
</p>
<p>rorthy of remark, that it was precisely at the period of Wallenstein's
</p>
<p>death that Richelieu obtained from the king an augmentation of his
</p>
<p>guard.
</p>
<p>[5] Richelieu was commonly supposed, though I cannot say I find much
</p>
<p>evidence for it, to have been too presuming in an interview with Anne of
</p>
<p>Austria [the Queen,] and to have bitterly resented the contempt she ex-
</p>
<p>pressed for him. The Duke of Buckingham's frantic and Quixotic passion
</p>
<p>tor the Queen is well known.
</p>
<p>[6] The fear and the hatred which Richelieu generally inspired were not
</p>
<p>ghiired by his dependants and those about his person, who are said " to
</p>
<p>have adored him."  Ses domestiques le regardaient comme le meilleur des
</p>
<p>niaitres.  Le Clerc. In fact although il etoit orgueiUeux et colere,  he was
</p>
<p>en meme temps, affable et plein de douceur dans Vabord ; and he was no less
</p>
<p>guncrous to those who served than sovere to those who opposed him.

</p>
<p>NOTES TO ACT IV.
</p>
<p>\\\ Omitted in representation from line 13 to 66.
</p>
<p>[2] Louis XIII. is said to have possessed some natural talents, and in
</p>
<p>earlier youth to have exhibited the germs of nobler qualities ; but a
</p>
<p>lilight seems to have passed over his maturer life. Personally brave,
</p>
<p>but mrrally timid,  always governed, whether by his mother or his minis-
</p>
<p>ter, and always repining at the yoke. The only affection amounting to a
</p>
<p>pas&icn that he betrayed was for the sports of the field ; yet it was his
</p>
<p>craviag weafaiess, and this throws a kind of false interest over his char-
</p>
<p>acte.7, to wish to be loved. He himself loved no one. He suffered the only
</p>
<p>wom dn W'ho seems to liave been attached to him to wither in a convent-
</p>
<p>he g ;iv up favourite after favourite to exile or the block. When Richeiiea
</p>
<p>iiu'j b said, coldly, " Voil^. un grand politique mort !" and when the ill
</p>
<p>RICHELIEU. 9f
</p>
<p>fated but unprincipled Cinq Mars, whom he called le cher ami, waa bo-
</p>
<p>headed, he drew out his watch at the fatal hour, and said with a smile, " 1
</p>
<p>think at this moment ttat le cher ami fait une vilaine mine." Neverthe-
</p>
<p>less his conscience at times [for he was devout and superstitious] made
</p>
<p>him gentle ; and his pride and his hoaour would often, when least expect-
</p>
<p>ed, rouse him into haughty but brief resistance to the despotism under
</p>
<p>which he lived.
</p>
<p>[3] I^uis had some musical taste and accomplishment, wherewith he
</p>
<p>often communicated to his favourites some of that wearisome ennui undei
</p>
<p>Which he himself almost unceasingly languished.
</p>
<p>[4] One of Louis's most bitter complaints against Richelieu was th*
</p>
<p>continued banishment of the Queen Mother. It is impossible, however, no\
</p>
<p>to be convinced that the return of that worthless intriguante was wholly
</p>
<p>incompatible with the tranquility of the kingdom. Yet, on the other hand,
</p>
<p>the poverty and privation which she endured in exile are discreditable to
</p>
<p>the generosity and the gratitude of Richelieu  she was his first patron,
</p>
<p>though afterwards his most powerful persecutor.
</p>
<p>[5] In his Memoirs Richelieu gives an amusing account of the insolence
</p>
<p>and arts of Baradas, and observes with indignant astonishment, that the
</p>
<p>favourite was never weary of repeating to the King that he [Baradas]
</p>
<p>would have made just as great a minister as Richelieu. It is on the at-
</p>
<p>tachment of Baradas to La Cressias, a maid of honour to the Queen Mother
</p>
<p>of whom, according to Baradas, the King was enamoured also, that hia
</p>
<p>love for the Julie de Mortemar of the play has been founded. The secret of
</p>
<p>Baradas's sudden and extraordinary influence with the King seems to rest
</p>
<p>in the personal adoration which he professed for Louis, with whom he
</p>
<p>affected all the jealousy of a lover, but whom he flattered with the ardent
</p>
<p>chivalry of a knight. Even after his disgrace he placed upon his banner,
</p>
<p>* Fiat voluntas tua."
</p>
<p>[6] Louis was called The Just, but for no other reason than that he waa
</p>
<p>bom under the Libra.
</p>
<p>[7] Louis XIII, did not resemble either his father or his son in the ar
</p>
<p>dour of his attachments ; if not wholly platonic, they were wholly unim
</p>
<p>passioned ; yet no man was more jealous, or more unscrupulously tyranni-

</p>
<p>cal when the jealousy was aroused.
</p>
<p>[8] One of Richelieu's severest and least politic laws was that which
</p>
<p>made duelling a capital crime. Never was the punishment against the
</p>
<p>offence more relentlessly enforced ; and never were duels so desperate and
</p>
<p>30 numerous. The punishment of death must be evidently ineffectual so
</p>
<p>long as to refuse a duel is to be dishonoured, and so long as men hold the
</p>
<p>doctrine, however wrong, that it is better to part with the life that Heaven
</p>
<p>gave than the honour man makes. In fact, the greater the danger he in-
</p>
<p>curred, the greater was the punctilio of the cavalier of the time in brav-
</p>
<p>ing it.
</p>
<p>[9] For the haughty and rebuking tone which Richelieu assumed in his
</p>
<p>poetulations with the King, see his Memoirs [passim] in [Petitot's collec-
</p>
<p>tion, vols. 22  30 lbis.'\ Montesquieu, in one of his brilliant antitheses says
</p>
<p>well of Richelieu, II avila leroi, mais il illustrata le r^gue."
</p>
<p>[10] However " or gueilleux and colere' in his disputes with Louis, the
</p>
<p>Cardinal did not always disdain recourse to the arts of the courtier ;  once
</p>
<p>after an angry discussion with the king, in which, as usual, Richelieu got
</p>
<p>the better, Louis, as they quitted the palace together, said rudely, " Sortez
</p>
<p>le premier ; vous etes bien le roi de France." " Si je passe le premier,"
</p>
<p>replied the minister, after a moment's hesitation, and with great adroitnesa
</p>
<p>" ce ne peut etre que comme le plus humble de vos serviteurs ;" and he
</p>
<p>took a flambeau from one of the pages, to light the king as he walked ]>
</p>
<p>fore him  " en reculant et sans toumcs le doa."

</p>
<p>[12] Like Cromwell and Rienzi, Richelieu appears to have been easilj
</p>
<p>moved to tears. The Qneen Mother, who put the hardest interpretation oq
</p>
<p>that humane weakness, which is natural with very excitable temperamentg
</p>
<p>said that " II pleu'rait quand il voulait." I may add to those who may b
</p>
<p>inclined to imagine that Richelieu appears in parts of this scene too de-
</p>
<p>jected for consistency wi h so imperious a character, that it is recorded of
</p>
<p>nim that " quand Ses affaires ne eruississoient pas, il se trouvoit abattu el

</p>
<p>NOTES TO ACT Y.
</p>
<p>[1] See in " Cinq Mars," vol. v. the striking and brilliant chapter from
</p>
<p>which the interlude of the Secretaries is borrowed.
</p>
<p>[2] The passion of the drama requires this catastrophe for Baradaa. He
</p>
<p>however, survived his disgrace, though stripped of all his rapidly-acquired
</p>
<p>fortunes  and the daring that belonged to his character won him distinc-
</p>
<p>tion in foreign service. He returned to France after Richelieu's death, but
</p>
<p>never regained the same court influence. He had taken the vowa of a
</p>
<p>knight of Malta, and Louis made him a Prior.
</p>
<p>[3] The sudden resuscitation of Richelieu [not to strain too much on the
</p>
<p>real passion which supports him in this scene] is in conformance with the
</p>
<p>more dissimulating part of his character. The extraordinary mobility of
</p>
<p>his countenance [latterly so deathlike, save when the mind spoke in the
</p>
<p>features] always lent itself to stage effect of this nature. The queen
</p>
<p>mother said of him, that she had seen him one moment so feeble, cast
</p>
<p>down, and " semi-mort," that he seemed on the point of giving up the
</p>
<p>ghost  and the next moment he would start up full ol animation, energy
</p>
<p>and life.
