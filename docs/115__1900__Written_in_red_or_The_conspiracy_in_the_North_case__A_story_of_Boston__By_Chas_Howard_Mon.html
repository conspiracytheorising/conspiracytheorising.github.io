</p>
<p>WRITTEN IN RED ;
</p>
<p>OR, THE CONSPIRACY JN THE NORTH CASE.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER I.
</p>
<p>FOUND DEAD.
</p>
<p>npHE private office of North & Stackhouse, State
</p>
<p>1 Street, bankers and brokers, contained on the
</p>
<p>morning of Friday, June 16, 1887, a group of
</p>
<p>anxious and excited men, whose conversation
</p>
<p>plainly indicated that their uneasiness was caused
</p>
<p>by the continued and unexplained absence of Paul
</p>
<p>North, the senior partner.
</p>
<p>In State Street circles, North & Stackhouse were
</p>
<p>classed among the " plungers." For the first two
</p>
<p>years of the firm's existence, indeed, there had been
</p>
<p>but slight departure from the conservative policy
</p>
<p>followed by Mr. North, who, when in the broker-
</p>
<p>age business on his own account, had been content
</p>
<p>with a modest office in a comparatively quiet street
</p>
<p>leading eastward from Post Office Square.
</p>
<p>But, under the lead of Mr. Stackhouse an ener-
</p>
<p>getic man of forty, ten years his partner's junior
</p>
<p>banking had been added to brokerage ; and the
</p>
<p>firm had become widely known as the promoter of

</p>
<p>many daring enterprises.
</p>
<p>2 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>Nicaragua Midland was a speciality with North
</p>
<p>& Stackhouse. In season and out of season,
</p>
<p>Nicaragua Midland had been "boomed" with a
</p>
<p>persistency that caused some of the older magnates
</p>
<p>of "the street "to shake their heads ominously, but
</p>
<p>which had attracted, nevertheless, the admiration
</p>
<p>and co-operation of a multitude of people.
</p>
<p>Not all who invested their earnings under the
</p>
<p>Advice of North & Stackhouse had, it is true, found
</p>
<p>the venture profitable.
</p>
<p>But, for the most part, the losers had borne their
</p>
<p>ill fortune manfully, without complaining. Few
</p>
<p>angry outbursts from disappointed patrons had
</p>
<p>disturbed the optimistic hopes of the bright-eyed
</p>
<p>speculators, who, month after month, had made the
</p>
<p>rooms of these State Street bankers and brokers
</p>
<p>their favorite haunt.
</p>
<p>Twelve days previous to this June morning in
</p>
<p>1887, however, a curious letter, in an unknown
</p>
<p>hand, had been laid on Mr. North's desk. The
</p>
<p>writing was an odd sort of scrawl, uncertain in its
</p>
<p>lines, but legible enough. This was the missive :
</p>
<p>" MY DEAR SIR. I am a desperate man, ruined by your
</p>
<p>manipulations of the property entrusted to your hands. I
</p>
<p>must have money enough to begin life again. I only ask for a
</p>
<p>little back out of all you robbed me of, but that little I must
</p>
<p>have. There is only one thing for you to do : Draw a check,
</p>
<p>for one thousand dollars, payable to bearer, and enclose it
</p>
<p>addressed to me at the post office, Boston. If you fail in this,
</p>
<p>I swear to shoot you down as I would a mad dog. If you are
</p>
<p>wise, you will not refer this matter to the police. That act

</p>
<p>would be your death warrant. " DANIEL STJCKNEY."
</p>
<p>FOUND DEAD. 3
</p>
<p>Paul North, to whom, personally, this threatening
</p>
<p>letter was addressed, had consulted his partner, in
</p>
<p>some little uneasiness of mind.
</p>
<p>" It's all nonsense," Mr. Stackhouse had said,
</p>
<p>confidently. " A mere practical joke of some
</p>
<p>broker who wants to frighten you. A few of them
</p>
<p>were nipped in the last turn of the market in our
</p>
<p>favor, you know, and perhaps they hold North &
</p>
<p>Stackhouse responsible. But, if the matter dis-
</p>
<p>turbs you at all, why, turn the letter over to the
</p>
<p>police. They'll attend to it. We must look after
</p>
<p>Nicaragua Midland very sharply this week, North,
</p>
<p>and have no time to bother our heads about
</p>
<p>trifles."
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mr. North had troubled himself
</p>
<p>about the matter sufficiently to put the letter into
</p>
<p>the hands of Inspector Applebee for such action as
</p>
<p>seemed proper.
</p>
<p>Upon the advice of that quietly efficient person-
</p>
<p>age, a decoy letter had been written by Mr. North,
</p>
<p>enclosing a check for 1000 dollars, payable to
</p>
<p>bearer.
</p>
<p>An officer, in citizen's clothes, had been stationed
</p>
<p>on duty constantly at the post office, but no Daniel
</p>
<p>Stickney had called for the letter addressed to his
</p>
<p>name.
</p>
<p>As a precaution against any possible oversight,
</p>
<p>payment of the check had been stopped at the
</p>
<p>bank, a precaution which, thus far, had proved
</p>
<p>equally useless.

</p>
<p>" Just as I told you," Stackhouse had said to his
</p>
<p>4 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>partner after a few days. " A broker's practical
</p>
<p>joke."
</p>
<p>The letter soon passed out of mind, for business
</p>
<p>cares weighed heavily on both partners.
</p>
<p>What had long been feared had taken place. The
</p>
<p>market had become very " bearish." All stocks felt
</p>
<p>the mysterious influence of depression, and among
</p>
<p>the very first to fall was Nicaragua Midland.
</p>
<p>So absorbed and anxious had Mr. North become
</p>
<p>that he could talk and think of little except the
</p>
<p>market and its prospects.
</p>
<p>Was it altogether on the subject of Nicaragua
</p>
<p>Midland that he had held conference, late in the
</p>
<p>afternoon of the isth of June, with one of the chief
</p>
<p>investors, though not a director in the Nicaragua
</p>
<p>Midland Mr. Richard Fetridge?
</p>
<p>Whether or not, the interview had not been
</p>
<p>finished at the office ; for the two men had been
</p>
<p>seen to walk away together, still talking earnestly.
</p>
<p>Old Jobson, the veteran clerk of the firm, had
</p>
<p>looked after them as they passed up the street.
</p>
<p>" It's a tight time for North & Stackhouse," he
</p>
<p>had said to himself, shaking his head. " If things
</p>
<p>don't take an upward turn very soon, I'm afraid
</p>
<p>to-morrow's meeting of Nicaragua directors will do
</p>
<p>precious little good ! "
</p>
<p>The junior partner had left the office hours be-
</p>
<p>fore, outwardly calm. Whatever his forbodings
</p>
<p>may have been, Thornton Stackhouse was not the
</p>
<p>man to allow his troubles to show themselves in

<p>look or manner.
</p>
<p>FOUXD DEAD. 5
</p>
<p>Paul North was the father-in-law of his business
</p>
<p>associate, and Thornton Stackhouse made his home
</p>
<p>in summer time at Mr. North's spacious villa at
</p>
<p>Swampscott, from whose broad windows the occu-
</p>
<p>pants enjoyed an exhilarating prospect of the sail-
</p>
<p>flecked ocean.
</p>
<p>At ten o'clock in the morning of this Friday, the
</p>
<p>i6th of June, the directors of Nicaragua Midland
</p>
<p>had assembled, pursuant to call, in the office of
</p>
<p>North & Stackhouse. Half an hour later every
</p>
<p>face wore a look of anxious expectation.
</p>
<p>" I don't understand it at all," exclaimed Stack-
</p>
<p>house, nervously walking up and down. " North is
</p>
<p>the most punctual of men, as you all know. He
</p>
<p>must be ill."
</p>
<p>"Ill !" echoed one of the directors. "Wasn't
</p>
<p>North all right when you left him at Swampscott
</p>
<p>this morning ?"
</p>
<p>Mr. Stackhouse waved his hand impatiently.
</p>
<p>" I didn't go down to the shore last night," he
</p>
<p>returned, shortly. " Stayed in town with a friend.
</p>
<p>I left North here in this office about three o'clock
</p>
<p>in the afternoon, and haven't laid eyes on him
</p>
<p>since ! "
</p>
<p>" Why don't you telegraph to his house ? " asked
</p>
<p>a little man near the door. " It's strange he hasn't
</p>
<p>sent some word himself before this time. But I
</p>
<p>suppose he's ill, and his daughters are so v/orried
</p>
<p>about him that they have forgotten to send. Just
</p>
<p>like women ! " the testy little bachelor added.

</p>
<p>The suggestion was acted upon instantly. After
</p>
<p>6 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>an interminable delay a response came, evoking a
</p>
<p>simultaneous murmur of dismay and the interchange
</p>
<p>of apprehensive looks.
</p>
<p>" SWAMPSCOTT, June 16.
</p>
<p>" Mr. North must have stayed in town. He has not been
</p>
<p>here since yesterday morning. " COMFORT II AR WOOD."
</p>
<p>" Strange ! " ejaculated Stackhouse, ringing the
</p>
<p>bell as he spoke. " Send Mr. Jobson in," he
</p>
<p>added, the next moment, to the waiting messenger.
</p>
<p>The old clerk was in the room before the mes-
</p>
<p>senger had left it, trembling all over with senile
</p>
<p>agitation.
</p>
<p>" At what time did Mr. North leave the office
</p>
<p>yesterday afternoon ? " Stackhouse demanded ab-
</p>
<p>ruptly.
</p>
<p>" It was after five o'clock, sir."
</p>
<p>" Was he alone ? "
</p>
<p>" No, sir. Mr. Fetridge was with him."
</p>
<p>" Probably went out of town somewhere with Fet-
</p>
<p>ridge," suggested one of the directors. " Delayed
</p>
<p>missed a train. Very provoking ! On this day,
</p>
<p>too, of all others ! But send round to Fetridge's
</p>
<p>office and see if he has been heard from."
</p>
<p>Unasked, the old clerk took upon himself the
</p>
<p>duty of messenger, and the party anxiously awaited
</p>
<p>his return. But one question and answer were
</p>
<p>interchanged meanwhile.
</p>
<p>" Has Nicaragua been quoted to-day, Stack-
</p>
<p>house ? " the little old bachelor queried.
</p>
<p>" Yes. Offered at 9. No takers. Off a point

</p>
<p>already, you see."
</p>
<p>FOUND DEAD. 7
</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps and voices in the outer
</p>
<p>office announced to the anxious ear of Stackhouse
</p>
<p>the coming of Mr. Fetridge himself. The broker
</p>
<p>stepped forward.
</p>
<p>" Well ? "
</p>
<p>It was evident at first sight that the new comer
</p>
<p>was unduly agitated. He was a stalwart, handsome
</p>
<p>fellow, certainly not beyond thirty years of age.
</p>
<p>" I cannot imagine where North is any more than
</p>
<p>you," he exclaimed, without waiting for question.
</p>
<p>" I walked up the street with him yesterday after-
</p>
<p>noon, after a talk in his office."
</p>
<p>" Where did you leave him ? "
</p>
<p>Fetridge flushed and seemed considering a reply.
</p>
<p>All eyes were turned on him.
</p>
<p>" I don't know the exact point," he said at last.
</p>
<p>" At the corner of State and Washington Streets, I
</p>
<p>think it was."
</p>
<p>Stackhouse, who was very nervous and more
</p>
<p>affected than the occasion seemed to require, stared
</p>
<p>at Fetridge blankly, as if utterly at a loss to account
</p>
<p>for his confusion.
</p>
<p>" His town house is closed for the summer," he
</p>
<p>suggested, his eyes still on Fetridge's face. " He
</p>
<p>must have gone to some hotel."
</p>
<p>" Send a messenger to make the rounds ! " ex-
</p>
<p>citedly demanded the little bachelor.
</p>
<p>Richard Fetridge seemed to find the situation
</p>
<p>unaccountably embarrassing. He had no advice
</p>
<p>to offer. Stackhouse particularly appeared to dis-

</p>
<p>concert him. Murmuring something about having
</p>
<p>8 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>left a man waiting for him at his office, and that
</p>
<p>he presumed North would be found speedily, he
</p>
<p>hastened out and betook himself in the direction of
</p>
<p>his place of business. The necessity of haste in his
</p>
<p>return, however, seemed to become less obvious to
</p>
<p>him after he reached the open air. He stood stock
</p>
<p>still with his foot upon the flight of stairs leading
</p>
<p>to his office, and then, under the stress of a sudden
</p>
<p>thought, wheeled abruptly and walked energetically
</p>
<p>back up the street.
</p>
<p>In five minutes he was in police headquarters at
</p>
<p>Pemberton Square, inquiring anxiously of the
</p>
<p>official to whom the clerk referred him whether any
</p>
<p>notification of the disappearance of Paul North had
</p>
<p>been sent to him. The official professed ignorance
</p>
<p>of the matter.
</p>
<p>" When was he last seen, sir ? "
</p>
<p>" Yesterday afternoon about five o'clock, going
</p>
<p>up State Street from his office," Fetridge rejoined,
</p>
<p>avoiding further detail. And hastened to add :
</p>
<p>" He has a town house at Marlboro Street, you
</p>
<p>know. Perhaps it isn't my place to suggest it, but
</p>
<p>don't the police in such cases have authority to
</p>
<p>enter a man's premises if "
</p>
<p>Fetridge hesitated. The official observed him
</p>
<p>narrowly, wondering, no doubt, why he was so ob-
</p>
<p>viously agitated.
</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly ; if his friends desired it, and had
</p>
<p>any reason to believe that there was anything the
</p>
<p>matter, the police would enter the house."

</p>
<p>Fetridge thereupon urged the official to obtain
</p>
<p>FOUND DEAD. 9
</p>
<p>permission from Thornton Stackhouse to make a
</p>
<p>search of the premises. He was unable to give any
</p>
<p>direct reason, and unwilling to put into words any
</p>
<p>definite suspicion, but he showed by his conduct
</p>
<p>that he had both. Eventually a messenger was
</p>
<p>despatched in search of Stackhouse, who thereupon
</p>
<p>responded in person. He seemed a little surprised
</p>
<p>to see Fetridge, and the official noted that there
</p>
<p>was a constrainedness and a lack of cordiality
</p>
<p>between the two men. Their opinions, however,
</p>
<p>coincided upon the matter in question.
</p>
<p>" By all means," said Stackhouse, " search the
</p>
<p>house in Marlboro Street. It is my residence as
</p>
<p>well as North's, and I authorize you if the men
</p>
<p>sent are discreet and trustworthy."
</p>
<p>The official arose.
</p>
<p>" Then I will send word at once by telephone to
</p>
<p>Station 4. You don't happen to have a key to the
</p>
<p>house about you ? "
</p>
<p>" Why, no," returned the partner. " My keys
</p>
<p>are in my wife's care at Swampscott, or I should
</p>
<p>have gone to the house myself."
</p>
<p>The message was sent, and while the police of
</p>
<p>the fourth division were acting in accordance there-
</p>
<p>with, Stackhouse and Fetridge sat waiting at head-
</p>
<p>quarters, the quiet broken only by the scratching
</p>
<p>of the busy pen of a clerk.
</p>
<p>No. Marlboro Street was a broad, brown
</p>
<p>house, the counterpart of half a hundred other
</p>
<p>dwellings within a stone's throw of Paul North's

<p>10 1. RI1 TEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>As the sergeant and patrolman of the fourth divi-
</p>
<p>sion neared the place, they observed the outer door
</p>
<p>at the entrance, and saw that all the windows in the
</p>
<p>basement and first story were barred or shuttered.
</p>
<p>Curtains, closely drawn, lent a cheerless and
</p>
<p>deserted appearance to the windows above.
</p>
<p>" And yet," remarked the sergeant, as he went
</p>
<p>up the steps, " somebody has been here. The
</p>
<p>outer door is open ; the vestibule door unlocked."
</p>
<p>It was indeed true, and led at once to the con-
</p>
<p>clusion that Paul North was within.
</p>
<p>The officer rang the be!!. But though the sum-
</p>
<p>mons was repeated again and again it awoke no
</p>
<p>responsive life inside the darkened, echoing house.
</p>
<p>The sergeant calmly came to the conclusion that
</p>
<p>an entrance must be forced, and after a brief
</p>
<p>inspection of the premises sent Johnson, the officer,
</p>
<p>in quest of a ladder. The ladder was obtained
</p>
<p>from the nearest depository of the fire department ;
</p>
<p>and the officers were soon in the rear of Paul
</p>
<p>North's residence.
</p>
<p>It took but a minute to open the door of the
</p>
<p>yard. In another minute the ladder rested against
</p>
<p>a brick wall, and Officer Johnson, with a curious
</p>
<p>piece of flexible steel in his grasp, had pushed back
</p>
<p>the lock of a curtained window in the second story.
</p>
<p>" A bedroom," said the sergeant, pulling up the
</p>
<p>curtain with some difficulty, when they were both
</p>
<p>inside ; " bed untouched, however. Door open
</p>
<p>into that dark room in front. Other door open

<p>to the corridor, no doubt."
</p>
<p>FOUND DEAD. II
</p>
<p>\
</p>
<p>The sergeant led the way through a. door diago-
</p>
<p>nally opposite the window by which they had gained
</p>
<p>entrance.
</p>
<p>It was the corridor, as he had expected. He set
</p>
<p>out methodically to peer into the rooms as he went
</p>
<p>along, but he met with an obstacle at the very
</p>
<p>outset.
</p>
<p>At the head of the broad front staircase the door
</p>
<p>refused to yield to his pressure beyond a limited
</p>
<p>degree. Officer Johnson was about to push the
</p>
<p>door vigorously when he was stopped by a warn-
</p>
<p>ing gesture from his superior.
</p>
<p>As the patrolman stepped back the sergeant,
</p>
<p>pressing against the door as lightly as possible, in-
</p>
<p>sinuated his way into the unvisited room. A half-
</p>
<p>stifled cry brought his subordinate to his side.
</p>
<p>" Don't move it ! Don't touch it ! " whispered
</p>
<p>the sergeant, putting an admonitory hand on the
</p>
<p>officer's shoulder. It was by no means horror
</p>
<p>which inspired his utterance. Both men looked
</p>
<p>down upon a figure, lying with outstretched, clutch-
</p>
<p>ing hands, close against the door.
</p>
<p>With the caution of experience the sergeant bent
</p>
<p>down, and placed his hand over the heart.
</p>
<p>" Dead ! " he said in a moment, half to himself,
</p>
<p>half to his companion, and straightened up without
</p>
<p>losing his composure.
</p>
<p>Officer Johnson, new to the force and to this
</p>
<p>kind of experience, by no means preserved his
</p>
<p>presence of mind in the emergency, and held fast

<p>to the sergeant.
</p>
<p>12 WRITTEN IN RED,
</p>
<p>The room, seen through the twilight, had a
</p>
<p>weird, uncanny look ; the tables, enswathed in
</p>
<p>their coverings, seemed coffin shaped, and the
</p>
<p>chandelier, in its shroud of brown holland, might
</p>
<p>have been a ghost pointing down to the inanimate
</p>
<p>figure on the floor.
</p>
<p>" What's that on the wall by the door ? " whis-
</p>
<p>pered Officer Johnson, pointing with shaking
</p>
<p>finger.
</p>
<p>The sergeant had opened the window almost
</p>
<p>before his companion had finished the sentence.
</p>
<p>In the glare of the sudden instreaming sunlight
</p>
<p>on the tinted wall, low down, near the door by
</p>
<p>which the body lay, was a scrawl in dull red :
</p>
<p>" Stockhart Stockhaus Stockhouj ! "
</p>
<p>Thus the sergeant, as they both stared with all
</p>
<p>their eyes.
</p>
<p>" There's a ' Stack,' or ' Stock,' written there,"
</p>
<p>said the officer, positively. " Whatever the rest
</p>
<p>may mean, that much is certain."
</p>
<p>He was still gazing at the message when he re-
</p>
<p>ceived a peremptory order to proceed to the station

<p>and notify the authorities.
</p>
<p>FOUND DEAD. 13
</p>
<p>" For there's a hue and cry coming out of this
</p>
<p>thing, or I'm no prophet," the sergeant said.
</p>
<p>And as he waited for the coming of his associates
</p>
<p>the sergeant looked down thoughfully at the silent
</p>
<p>figure. What an uproar and commotion in the
</p>
<p>community would follow this discovery, so quietly
</p>
<p>made in the silent chamber ! The sergeant was
</p>
<p>philosopher enough in his way to think of this
</p>
<p>and to mutter to himself as he kept his lonely
</p>
<p>watch :
</p>
<p>' Within twenty-four hours, for all you lie there
</p>
<p>so silent and utter no sound, the thoughts and con-
</p>
<p>jectures of a million people will center about you,
</p>
<p>and Heaven knows how many lives and loves you
</p>
<p>will make and break before you are through with
</p>
<p>them ! "
</p>
<p>The sergeant was quite right. The arm of a
</p>
<p>dead man may have a tremendous power to threat-
</p>
<p>en and control, and Paul North dead might work

<p>CHAPTER II.
</p>
<p>A PERFUME AS OF A WOMAN.
</p>
<p>PHILOSOPHICALLY reflecting, Sergeant Parr
</p>
<p>1 continued, nevertheless, a careful scrutiny of the
</p>
<p>apartment. It was beyond doubt a library, for the
</p>
<p>backs of books showed behind the sheets that cov-
</p>
<p>ered certain articles of large bulk. The adjoining
</p>
<p>room was in all probability the sleeping chamber of
</p>
<p>the master of the house. A casual inspection satis-
</p>
<p>fied the officer that the bed had not been occupied
</p>
<p>since it was last made up.
</p>
<p>But there was something more important still in
</p>
<p>the sergeant's estimation to be ascertained, and on
</p>
<p>that he had ample time to reach a settled convic-
</p>
<p>tion. It was evident at first sight that the man on
</p>
<p>the floor had come to his death by reason of a bul-
</p>
<p>let wound. If his own hand had been responsible
</p>
<p>for the deed, the suicidal weapon must be some-
</p>
<p>where about. And as a careful search failed to
</p>
<p>reveal any trace of such a weapon, the sergeant had
</p>
<p>made up his mind long previous to the arrival of
</p>
<p>the investigating party that the case was a very
</p>
<p>serious one and involved at the outset a deep
</p>
<p>mystery.
</p>
<p>The scene soon changed. The room gradually

</p>
<p>filled with alert and dignified men, whose profession
</p>
<p>made their attendance at such times a matter of
</p>
<p>too frequent occurrence to permit of their exhibit-
</p>
<p>ing any other sentiment in the presence of the grim
</p>
<p>witness of violent death than a keen and specula-
</p>
<p>tive business interest. In the vestibule below, two
</p>
<p>officers were stationed to challenge everybody who
</p>
<p>attempted to enter the house. Already in front of
</p>
<p>the building, so quickly and mysteriously does evil
</p>
<p>news disseminate itself, was gathered a throng which
</p>
<p>stared with fascinated horror at the upper windows
</p>
<p>and at every fresh ingoer and outcomer.
</p>
<p>Sergt. Parr had long since recognized Inspector
</p>
<p>Applebee, and had whispered in his ear that it was
</p>
<p>going to be a " big case."
</p>
<p>" So ? " said the inspector, lifting his eye-brows
</p>
<p>and half smiling. A moment later he was grave
</p>
<p>and apparently unconcerned.
</p>
<p>Dr. Jarret, the medical examiner for the district
</p>
<p>in which the body was found, came to the scene in
</p>
<p>a carriage. Till he arrived nothing was done.
</p>
<p>The State imposes upon the judgment and good
</p>
<p>sense of these officials grave responsibilities. In
</p>
<p>three minutes after his horse stopped in front of
</p>
<p>the house, Dr. Jarrett was at work examining, ques-
</p>
<p>tioning, weighing the evidences in his own mind.
</p>
<p>The casual observer would have looked in vain
</p>
<p>among these quiet officials for the inevitable reporter.
</p>
<p>Evidently the newspaper man was barred out ! Not
</p>
<p>at all. The public who look for a notebook, and

</p>
<p>young man writing with ghoul-like activity, would
</p>
<p>never have suspected the short, thick-set, black-
</p>
<p>haired, gentlemanly young man who talked with
</p>
<p>each person present in an easy way, which showed
</p>
<p>that he was personally acquainted with every one.
</p>
<p>Instead of flourishing a notebook the insignia of
</p>
<p>the property reporter of the theater, and of the
</p>
<p>beginners in the profession this man had no bet-
</p>
<p>ter use for his hands than a mechanical fondling of
</p>
<p>the pendant to his watch chain a trick which in
</p>
<p>some mysterious manner seemed to help him to
</p>
<p>think. Although he was young, his experience in
</p>
<p>criminal affairs, combined with his natural ability,
</p>
<p>had made his sagacity equal to that of anybody
</p>
<p>present, while his trustworthiness and reliability
</p>
<p>enabled him to be oftentimes in important cases a
</p>
<p>confidant of the authorities. This was Kingman
</p>
<p>F. Thomas of the Boston Globe.
</p>
<p>The medical examiner arose from a brief inspec-
</p>
<p>tion of the body, which was already identified as
</p>
<p>that of Paul North, the State Street financier.
</p>
<p>Everybody looked at him curiously, but his imper-
</p>
<p>turbable face told no tales.
</p>
<p>" Nothing has been disturbed ? " he asked of the
</p>
<p>sergeant.
</p>
<p>" We knew our business, sir. Everything is ex-
</p>
<p>actly as we found it."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! " No more and no less, came in a matter-
</p>
<p>of-fact tone from the medical examiner's lips.
</p>
<p>" Well, doctor," said Mr. Thomas, " how is it?"

</p>
<p>" I shall perform an autopsy."
</p>
<p>A PERFUME AS OF A WOMAN. I?
</p>
<p>This was said quietly. The medical examiner
</p>
<p>retrained from advancing his opinion at this stage,
</p>
<p>hut Thomas understood that the determination to
</p>
<p>perform an autopsy indicated serious suspicion on
</p>
<p>the physician's part.
</p>
<p>There was a tremulous touch on his shoulder,
</p>
<p>and he turned to meet the eyes of a man whom he
</p>
<p>did not know.
</p>
<p>"What what is that writing on the wall
</p>
<p>down there by the door ? " asked a shaking
</p>
<p>voice.
</p>
<p>" This is a friend of the family, doctor," inter-
</p>
<p>posed Inspector Applebee, by way of accounting
</p>
<p>for this unfamiliar presence there. " He was Mr.
</p>
<p>North's partner. Naturally he is very much over-
</p>
<p>come."
</p>
<p>In tones that were a trifle steadier, Mr. Stack-
</p>
<p>house repeated his question. Bending down to
</p>
<p>seek an answer himself, he started back, and would
</p>
<p>have fallen but for the opportune aid of the news-
</p>
<p>paper man.
</p>
<p>" A horrible sight ! I cannot look at it," he
</p>
<p>muttered, putting his hand over his eyes. " Tell
</p>
<p>me what you make it out ! "
</p>
<p>A glance of intelligence passed between the
</p>
<p>inspector and the sergeant. Each divined perfectly
</p>
<p>what had brought such a shock to the mind of Paul
</p>
<p>North's partner. Each understood fully the man's
</p>
<p>unspoken fear.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile Dr. Jarret, anplying certain mysteri-

<p>ous tests, seemed more intent upon determining
</p>
<p>1 8 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>the medium of this strange message than the mes-
</p>
<p>sage itself.
</p>
<p>"Written in blood," he said, eventually, '.ooking
</p>
<p>steadily at Stackhouse ; " and the condition of the
</p>
<p>forefinger of the right hand seems to indicate that
</p>
<p>the dead man wrote it." He paused and Stack-
</p>
<p>house sank into a chair. " But what odds ? The
</p>
<p>writing will endure, gentlemen. We have other
</p>
<p>things to do."
</p>
<p>He gave the inspector a meaning look and
</p>
<p>resumed his work. Thomas lost not a detail of
</p>
<p>this scene.
</p>
<p>But now, with Inspector Applebee as his close
</p>
<p>companion, the library and the adjoining room
</p>
<p>were examined minutely.
</p>
<p>The room had been used very recently. Regard-
</p>
<p>ing that point, there was no possibility of doubt.
</p>
<p>Chairs had been moved from their accustomed
</p>
<p>places. On the opened desk, which Mr. Stack-
</p>
<p>house at once identified as his partner's, stood,
</p>
<p>amid a heap of tumbled papers, a drop light. Near
</p>
<p>by, a burnt match. Obviously the windows had
</p>
<p>not been touched.
</p>
<p>The adjoining room, vouched for as Paul North's
</p>
<p>chamber by his partner, soon recovering his self-
</p>
<p>control, bore no traces of occupancy. As the door
</p>
<p>was open between it and the library, it was plain
</p>
<p>xhat the master of the house must have passed
</p>
<p>through the room. He had not slept there, for the
</p>
<p>bed's surface was unrma-d, and not a fold of the

</p>
<p>pillows had been disturbed.
</p>

</p>
<p>" One thing is evident," said Thomas. " This
</p>
<p>man was not killed for money. I saw the doctor
</p>
<p>take a well-filled pocket-book from his person, and
</p>
<p>not a thing in the house appears to have been dis-
</p>
<p>turbed."
</p>
<p>A call from Dr. Jarrett summoned the two men
</p>
<p>back into the chamber of death.
</p>
<p>" You had better look for the bullet, gentlemen,"
</p>
<p>he said quietly. " It is evident that it went clear
</p>
<p>through him. and it is surely nowhere about his
</p>
<p>clothing."
</p>
<p>Instantly everybody was examining the room, the
</p>
<p>furniture, the walls, the carpet. But for some time,
</p>
<p>it appeared that the ball had been spirited away as
</p>
<p>mysteriously as the fatal weapon from which it
</p>
<p>had been fired.
</p>
<p>" Hallo ! " exclaimed Thomas, suddenly, as he
</p>
<p>pointed to the wall, " what's that up there above
</p>
<p>that picture ? "
</p>
<p>Thomas was pointing to a slight protuberance in
</p>
<p>the surface of the wall, directly opposite the bay-
</p>
<p>window, near the ceiling.
</p>
<p>" What, that ? " exclaimed the inspector. " Im-
</p>
<p>possible ! It is quite ten feet away trom the floor."
</p>
<p>" But it's a bullet, none the less," said Thomas,
</p>
<p>who had already mounted on a chair and began to
</p>
<p>ascertain the distance of the puncture above the
</p>
<p>carpet.
</p>
<p>" You are right, inspector," he said. " It is nine
</p>
<p>feet eleven inches from the floor, and is driven in

</p>
<p>of the bay-window over there near the writing,

</p>
<p>u I can't understand that at all," said the inspec-
</p>
<p>tor. " It must have been deflected in its course
</p>
<p>somehow to have got there. The man was evidently
</p>
<p>shot in the breast. His clothes in front are simply
</p>
<p>one mass of blood. Ah ! I see there was more
</p>
<p>than one shot fired. This is a stray ball."
</p>
<p>The house was searched from top to bottom.
</p>
<p>Nowhere was any trace of intrusion.
</p>
<p>" If Mr. North slept here at all last night," said
</p>
<p>the inspector, " it must have been in his chair in
</p>
<p>his library."
</p>
<p>Dr. Jarrett assented. Sergeant Parr, who had
</p>
<p>been notified from the fourth division that he need
</p>
<p>no longer remain on duty in the place, willingly
</p>
<p>volunteered to take, as he went out, a message to
</p>
<p>the captain in charge of the division.
</p>
<p>" I have sent for an ambulance," Dr. Jarrett
</p>
<p>explained to the group that surrounded him in
</p>
<p>Paul North's chamber. " The body will be taken
</p>
<p>to the morgue, and I will hold an autopsy at once.
</p>
<p>As Mr. North's partner is here, I will waive the
</p>
<p>r.sual formalities and state beforehand that there is
</p>
<p>little doubt that an inquest will take place, though
</p>
<p>I would ask reporters not to make any such direct
</p>
<p>announcement."
</p>
<p>Mr. Stackhouse bowed.
</p>
<p>" I quite understand, sir," he said, "and whatever
</p>
<p>testimony I can give I shall offer most willingly.

</p>
<p>Thomas sat cross-legged on one of the chairs ip
</p>
<p>the unoccupied chamber through which the officers
</p>
<p>had originally entered, making a rough sketch on
</p>
<p>the back of an envelope with a stubby pencil, when
</p>
<p>he was slightly startled by the unexpected presence
</p>
<p>of a man at his elbow.
</p>
<p>" Well, Thomas ? "
</p>
<p>" Ah, inspector."
</p>
<p>" How does it look to you ? "
</p>
<p>" Queer."
</p>
<p>" What are you going to say about it ? "
</p>
<p>"That it's a dead mystery unless we make some
</p>
<p>unexpected discovery in the next half hour."
</p>
<p>" Well, may be you're right. May be."
</p>
<p>" It's no suicide," said Thomas, affably ; " that's
</p>
<p>plain enough. And as there has been no robbery,
</p>
<p>it doesn't appear as yet why he should have been
</p>
<p>killed."
</p>
<p>" No ? "
</p>
<p>" But of course you have your theory already ? "
</p>
<p>"When it comes to the matter of theories," re-
</p>
<p>turned Applebee, mischievously, "a plain police-
</p>
<p>man like myself can't hold a candle to you news-
</p>
<p>paper fellows."
</p>
<p>" I see, you don't intend to answer questions,"
</p>
<p>said Thomas. " I suppose I may state that the
</p>
<p>police are already on the track of the murderer,
</p>
<p>and that important arrests are momentarily ex-
</p>
<p>pected ? "
</p>
<p>" State what you please. You will, any way,"

</p>
<p>the inspector returned, with a slight frown. " No,
</p>
<p>A PERFUME AS OF A WOMAN. 23
</p>
<p>I didn't come to answer questions, as you say. I
</p>
<p>came to ask them."
</p>
<p>" Better than nothing. What are they ?"
</p>
<p>" In the first place, did you know North ?"
</p>
<p>" Just to the same extent that I know hundreds
</p>
<p>of men. I have seen him, talked with him you
</p>
<p>know how and where."
</p>
<p>" In the line of your work, you mean ? "
</p>
<p>" Exactly. He was what I call a professional
</p>
<p>acquaintance. When we met in a crowd I saw
</p>
<p>North, the wealthy broker ; but he saw only the
</p>
<p>crowd. Poor fellow ! with all his resources he
</p>
<p>couldn't stop that bullet. Meantime, nobody
</p>
<p>thinks it worth while to shoot simple K. F.
</p>
<p>Thomas."
</p>
<p>" Well, I doubt that, too. I've heard the propo-
</p>
<p>sition seriously discussed at headquarters. Joking
</p>
<p>aside, what does rumor say about North's private
</p>
<p>life ? Was he still young in spite of his fifty years,
</p>
<p>or was he one of your quiet stay-at-homes ? "
</p>
<p>" So far as rumor reached me, he was a business
</p>
<p>man and nothing else. Anybody that ever saw
</p>
<p>Paul North, it seems to me, would say that he was
</p>
<p>too much engrossed in his life-long chase of the
</p>
<p>almighty dollar to have time for follies."
</p>
<p>" Then, as to his family ? "
</p>
<p>" They tell me he has two daughters ; both beau-
</p>
<p>ties. I never saw them, however. His wife, I be-
</p>
<p>lieve, is dead."
</p>
<p>" How did he stand in financial circles ? "

<p>" North & Stackhouse ? Ask any broker."
</p>
<p>" Bad ? "
</p>
<p>" Better put it that they showed too much enter-
</p>
<p>prise to please conservative business men. That's
</p>
<p>the most charitable construction I can put on it."
</p>
<p>" You didn't invest anything in their railroad,
</p>
<p>did you, Thomas ? " the inspector asked, quizzi-
</p>
<p>cally.
</p>
<p>" Did I ? No, sir. I'm not Jay Gould, and, if I
</p>
<p>had been, I should have known enough to have
</p>
<p>kept out of Nicaragua Midland. That was a fraud,
</p>
<p>inspector ; one of those frauds you can suspect,
</p>
<p>but never prove ; one of the numerous ' sup-
</p>

</p>
<p>one of the truths you can't print because it would
</p>
<p>libel some high-toned rascal whom the law is

<p>framed to protect ! "
</p>
<p>" Hump ! You have not a very high opinion of
</p>
<p>North & Stackhouse ? "
</p>
<p>Thomas shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p>'' Socially, they're gentlemen. Men who handle
</p>
<p>millions can never come down to the level of com-
</p>
<p>mon thieves."
</p>
<p>" They must be, then, enormously rich ?"
</p>
<p>" On the contrary ; they are regarded as ex-
</p>
<p>tremely shaky."
</p>
<p>" So ? And what have they done with these
</p>
<p>millions ? "
</p>

<p>ever so clever but I'm talking too much, inspec-
</p>
<p>tor. I am saying things on my mere surmises that
</p>
<p>no newspaper would dare to print. Still, you
</p>
<p>wanted my opinion, and you have it. It would be
</p>
<p>of no use, I suppose, to ask yours in return ? "
</p>
<p>Thomas gave Applebee a keen look, under the
</p>
<p>influence of which the inspector momentarily closed
</p>
<p>his eyes, as if afraid that the reporter might sur-
</p>
<p>prise his thoughts there.
</p>
<p>" Some clients of North & Stackhouse have no
</p>
<p>very pleasant feelings towards them, I presume, on
</p>
<p>account of this Nicaragua scheme?" he adroitly
</p>
<p>queried, as if to change the subject. It was adroit
</p>
<p>for that reason. While appearing to avoid a
</p>
<p>direct answer, he was, in reality, putting the very
</p>
<p>question which he desired to have answered.
</p>
<p>Did the reporter suspect ? There was not the
</p>
<p>faintest indication, either in his manner or in his
</p>
<p>quiet reply, that he did.
</p>
<p>"Some of the poor fools who invested their
</p>
<p>money in that scheme would very likely hold the
</p>
<p>firm morally responsible for ruining them."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! " said the inspector, as he turned away.
</p>
<p>" I suppose so. But I'm forgetting my case in
</p>
<p>listening to you."
</p>
<p>The fact was, Inspector Applebee was endeavor-
</p>
<p>ing to establish some connection between the
</p>
<p>anonymous threatening letter which, ten days be-
</p>
<p>fore, had been placed in his hands by the late Paul
</p>
<p>North, and this violent death.

</p>
<p>" But, in that case," he thought, " why has not
</p>
<p>26 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>the money been called for at the post office ? Is
</p>
<p>it possible that the writer of that letter was in a
</p>
<p>position to know that the matter had been placed
</p>
<p>in my hands ? I must move cautiously in this
</p>
<p>affair or ruin it at the outset."
</p>
<p>Not long after Mr. Thomas's departure, most of
</p>
<p>Applebee's associates left the house, the medical
</p>
<p>examiner going first of all.
</p>
<p>Paul North's body had been taken away in the
</p>
<p>undertaker's wagon, but the inspector and one offi-
</p>
<p>cer still remained on the premises.
</p>
<p>Quite by accident, as he was coming down the
</p>
<p>staircase which connected the library floor with the
</p>
<p>story above, after a prowl through the darkened
</p>
<p>rooms in the upper part of the house, the inspec-
</p>
<p>tor's eye caught the gleam of something white.
</p>
<p>He picked it up.
</p>
<p>It was a tiny lace handkerchief, such as a dainty
</p>
<p>woman often carries, but a man never. This was
</p>
<p>the thought that flashed through the inspector's
</p>
<p>mind, to give place instantly to another.
</p>
<p>That subtle, delicate perfume ! In all his long
</p>
<p>experience Inspector Applebee had never inhaled
</p>
<p>its like.
</p>
<p>" Ah ! " he thought as he held up the filmy lace
</p>
<p>and looked at it more closely. " But I might
</p>
<p>have known it from the first. A woman in the
</p>
<p>case ! "
</p>
<p>He pressed it again to his nose and put it care-
</p>
<p>fully away in a pocket-book. On second thought

<p>CHAPTER III.
</p>
<p>MR. LAMM ASSUMES COMPLICATED RELATIONS.
</p>
<p>ABOUT two o'clock in the afternoon of the day
</p>
<p>Paul North was found dead, Detective Lamm,
</p>
<p>pursuing the even contemplative tenor of his way
</p>
<p>by the old Granary burying ground, found himself
</p>
<p>suddenly arm in arm with an excited gentleman
</p>
<p>whose face he did not recall.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Lamm ? " questioned Mr. Richard Fet-
</p>
<p>ridge.
</p>
<p>" That is my name, sir."
</p>
<p>" Excuse me. I know you. I need your ser-
</p>
<p>vice at once. I have unlimited money at my dis-
</p>
<p>posal. You have been recommended to me by
</p>
<p>trusted friends as most discreet in your calling.
</p>
<p>Come with me ! "
</p>
<p>And without giving Mr. Lamm time to make
</p>
<p>demur to these hurried, disjointed remarks, Rich-
</p>
<p>ard Fetridge, still with the detective's arm in his
</p>
<p>grasp, hurried him down Tremont Street, up Beacon
</p>
<p>Street and Somerset Street, and so into Pemberton
</p>
<p>Square. If Detective Lamm had a momentary
</p>
<p>suspicion that this imperative gentleman was de-
</p>
<p>mented, a sidelong glance reassured him on that
</p>
<p>point. He had made physiognomy a study, and in

</p>
<p>his companion's face he read not lunacy, but un-
</p>
<p>usual excitement.
</p>
<p>The two were in Mr. Fetridge's private office,
</p>
<p>and the door secured against intrusion before De-
</p>
<p>tective Lamm's vis-a-vis declared himself.
</p>
<p>" Pardon my abruptness," said Fetndge. " Pres-
</p>
<p>sing business must be my excuse. Not to waste
</p>
<p>time in preambles, Detective Lamm, I want to
</p>
<p>retain your services in a matter of vital interest to
</p>
<p>me. You shall fix the amount of compensation
</p>
<p>yourself. Now will you undertake this service?"
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm looked at him calmly. "That de-
</p>
<p>pends somewhat upon the nature of the business in
</p>
<p>hand," he said drily.
</p>
<p>" Oh, it's perfectly legitimate," went on Mr. Fet-
</p>
<p>ridge. " It's this terrible murder in Marlboro
</p>
<p>Street the killing of Paul North. He was my
</p>
<p>friend ; I am on intimate terms with the family,
</p>
<p>and I wish to be kept fully posted on the progress
</p>
<p>of the work of detecting the guilty party."
</p>
<p>" Umha ! You have a keen interest in this mat-
</p>
<p>ter, sir ! "
</p>
<p>"Why, detective," said Fetridge, edging his
</p>
<p>chair closer, " I have good reason to be eager in
</p>
<p>this matter. As man to man, I tell you here that I
</p>
<p>believe the guilty man in this case to be Paul
</p>
<p>North's partner ! "
</p>
<p>The detective remained utterly unmoved, but
</p>
<p>grave and attentive.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Thornton Stackhouse?"

</p>
<p>"Of course," said Fetridge quickly, "I make
</p>
<p>3 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>this statement absolutely in confidence. I wouldn't
</p>
<p>condemn the man publicly on my simple suspi-
</p>
<p>cions."
</p>
<p>" Oh, of course not."
</p>
<p>" But I tell you, sir," Fetridge resumed, pacing
</p>
<p>the floor excitedly, " I know the man to be a
</p>
<p>villain. I know him for a scoundrel, and good
</p>
<p>heavens ! Poor North ! Poor Marion ! What a
</p>
<p>misfortune ! "
</p>
<p>A man more agitated than Mr. Richard Fetridge
</p>
<p>over a similar affair certainly had never fallen under
</p>
<p>Detective Lamm's observation. He dropped sud-
</p>
<p>denly into a chair, and was pressing his hands
</p>
<p>against his temples as if to still the throbbings of a
</p>
<p>violent headache. The detective watched him
</p>
<p>under his eyebrows. Now that he knew his name
</p>
<p>he remembered that he had heard of him as a young
</p>
<p>lawyer who had recently fallen heir to a large
</p>
<p>fortune, and it seemed to him too that he could
</p>
<p>dimly recall having heard him referred to as the
</p>
<p>Apollo Belvidere of State Street.
</p>
<p>" You will, of course, acquaint me with the
</p>
<p>reasons for your suspicions?" Mn Lamm mildly
</p>
<p>suggested, by way of bringing his now motionless
</p>
<p>client to a realization of his surroundings. Fetridge
</p>
<p>awoke from his trance with a start.
</p>
<p>" Reasons ? " he echoed. " No ! Certainly not !
</p>
<p>Why should I ? "
</p>
<p>" It might be well for me to have something to
</p>
<p>work on at the start, Mr. Fetridge."

<p>two or three turns up and down the apartment in
</p>
<p>thoughtful silence.
</p>
<p>" No," he said at last, pausing in front of the
</p>
<p>detective. " No, I see no reason for telling you
</p>
<p>not yet, certainly. It would not aid you in the
</p>
<p>least. It would simply convince you that Stack-
</p>
<p>house might have had a motive, and a strong one.
</p>
<p>As for anything else, you would be left as much in
</p>
<p>the dark as I am."
</p>
<p>" I would urge upon you "
</p>
<p>" It is useless," interrupted Fetridge. " There
</p>
<p>are family reasons for my silence. I am a friend
</p>
<p>of the family. Why, if it hadn't been so I should
</p>
<p>have gone at once with all I know to the police.
</p>
<p>But there are some things, Lamm, which the least
</p>
<p>said about the better and Stackhouse's incentive
</p>
<p>to this deed of violence is one of them."
</p>
<p>" Umha " (the detective had a habit of prefacing
</p>
<p>his discourse with this reflective grunt), "North
</p>
<p>had quite a family ? "
</p>
<p>" He has two daughters, sir."
</p>
<p>Fetridge had resumed his walk.
</p>
<p>"Young? Unmarried?"
</p>
<p>"What? Don't you know? The eldest, Marion,
</p>
<p>is Thornton Stackhouse's wife. The younger,
</p>
<p>Stella, is seventeen."
</p>
<p>" And Mrs. North ? "

<p>32 WRITTEN IN RED,
</p>
<p>them. Poor girls ! Poor old Aunt Comfort ! I
</p>
<p>say, Lamm, you'll undertake the case, wont you ?
</p>
<p>If there's any disgrace I can save this bereaved
</p>
<p>family, I am bound to do it. I want to employ you
</p>
<p>to hunt up evidence in behalf of the family, and to
</p>
<p>report to me as rapidly as possible. In fact, I wish
</p>
<p>to know, if it can be done, all the evidence the
</p>
<p>police have when the inquest is called. I wont
</p>
<p>conceal from you that the attitude I shall take on
</p>
<p>that occasion may be governed largely by what you
</p>
<p>tell me. And, by the way, when is the inquest
</p>
<p>likely to be held ? "
</p>
<p>" It is a delay of days or weeks, as the police
</p>
<p>determine."
</p>
<p>" Very well, and in the meantime I may count
</p>
<p>upon your undivided services. You understand
</p>
<p>what I want. I am always at my office here, or
</p>
<p>you may telegraph me at the Beach. Whenever
</p>
<p>there is any development in this sad affair, I desire
</p>
<p>to know it with as brief delay as possible, whether
</p>
<p>it helps or hinders my suspicions of Stackhouse in
</p>
<p>the case is not to the present purpose. Facts
</p>
<p>are what I wish to ascertain ; and there is
</p>
<p>nobody who can arrive at the facts more surely
</p>
<p>or more quickly than you and this is not flattery,
</p>
<p>either ! "
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm made a deprecatory gesture.
</p>
<p>" Well, Mr. Fetridge, no man can make a fairer
</p>
<p>offer than you've made, and under the circum-
</p>
<p>stances I'll be very glad to take up the case and see

</p>
<p>what I can make of it. Count upon me to let you
</p>
<p>LAMM'S COMPLICATED RELATIONS. 33
</p>
<p>know when I have found anything of the slightest
</p>
<p>value."
</p>
<p>"I certainly shall, detective," returned Fetridge,
</p>
<p>whose face expressed the satisfaction he felt at
</p>
<p>securing such an ally. And so the conference
</p>
<p>ended.
</p>
<p>Detective Lamm, now turning his steps towards
</p>
<p>his own office, not far away, bethought himself that
</p>
<p>this man Stackhouse, whom he knew very well by
</p>
<p>sight, would be likely to occupy a large share of
</p>
<p>his time and attention for many days to come.
</p>
<p>It came as a surprise, even to his imperturbable
</p>
<p>nature, to find that the first face to look into his as
</p>
<p>he entered his office was the face of Thornton
</p>
<p>Stackhouse. But Detective Lamm was quite equal
</p>
<p>to the occasion.
</p>
<p>" Were you waiting to see me ? " he asked, in
</p>
<p>his most matter-of-fact tones. A quick look had
</p>
<p>assured him that the banker, though less excited in
</p>
<p>manner than his recent client, was certainly not
</p>
<p>positively free from agitation.
</p>
<p>" Yes," said Mr. Stackhouse, taking a chair in
</p>
<p>response to the detective's beckoning invitation.
</p>
<p>" My name is Thornton Stackhouse. I have come
</p>
<p>almost directly from the house of my partner, Paul
</p>
<p>North. You know, of course, about his death his
</p>
<p>murder ? "
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm bowed, twirling a pen between his
</p>
<p>fingers, and waited for his companion to continue.
</p>
<p>" Perhaps I need not recount all the circum-

<p>stances, detective, that combine to make this a very

<p>34 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>difficult and delicate case. You will readily under-
</p>
<p>stand, without my saying anything further, that the
</p>
<p>very best and most confidential advice is requisite.
</p>
<p>And that is precisely why I came here, Mr. Lamm,
</p>
<p>to enlist your services in getting at the facts all
</p>
<p>the facts of this mysterious crime. Now, can I
</p>
<p>secure you ? There will be a handsome compensa-
</p>
<p>tion you will have all the time and money needed
</p>
<p>to carry on your investigation."
</p>
<p>Detective Lamm, looking at the wall and still
</p>
<p>twirling his pen in his hands, seemed to be consid-
</p>
<p>ering what engagements he had made with which
</p>
<p>this new commission might conflict. At least,
</p>
<p>such was the impression of Thornton Stackhouse.
</p>
<p>" I don't know," the detective said slowly, at
</p>
<p>last. " I have a great deal of business just now
</p>
<p>more than I can properly handle in fact. It
</p>
<p>depends upon what you want. Was there any par-
</p>
<p>ticular point you wished to present to my attention,
</p>
<p>Mr. Stackhouse, or was it simply that you wished
</p>
<p>me to ascertain facts and report to you ? "
</p>
<p>Mr. Stackhouse looked at the door with some
</p>
<p>vague apprehension.
</p>
<p>" We shall not be disturbed," said the detective ;
</p>
<p>" I sprang the lock as I came in."
</p>
<p>Mr. Stackhouse brought his chair close to the
</p>
<p>detective. When he spoke it was in very low tones,
</p>
<p>hardly above a whisper.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Lamm, you may have read in the afternoon
</p>
<p>papers that a name was written on the wall close

<p>to where my partner lay dead."

<p>LAMM'S COMPLICATED RELATIONS. 35
</p>
<p>A nod and a renewed twirling of the pen.
</p>
<p>" That name, Mr. Lamm, was meant to be mine
</p>
<p>was mine ! "
</p>
<p>The detective raised his eyebrows and seemed
</p>
<p>about to speak.
</p>
<p>"You are going to ask me how I know," said
</p>
<p>Stackhouse. " Why, I read it with my own eyes.
</p>
<p>Yes, the papers said the scrawl might have meant
</p>
<p>Stick or Stock or Stockholm, and so on ; but I had
</p>
<p>a keener and truer sight than the officers there.
</p>
<p>" Now, detective, that name was written by some
</p>
<p>enemy of mine, who seeks to implicate me in
</p>
<p>this terrible affair. I am convinced of the fact.
</p>
<p>And, being so convinced, a man of your experience
</p>
<p>does not need to be told that I dismiss the idea
</p>
<p>that Paul North wrote that name on the wall as
</p>
<p>utterly out of the question."
</p>
<p>The grave, listening face near his wore no look
</p>
<p>of surprise, as Mr. Lamm nodded his full under-
</p>
<p>standing of his visitor's thought.
</p>
<p>" North being put aside, we must look for the
</p>
<p>guilty party in another quarter. Mr. Lamm, you
</p>
<p>don't happen to recollect who it was at the meeting
</p>
<p>of Nicaragua directors, of which the papers pub-
</p>
<p>lished an account, testified that he parted with Paul
</p>
<p>North late yesterday afternoon ? "
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm did not appear to recollect, for he
</p>
<p>pursed up his lips, shrugged his shoulders slightly,
</p>
<p>and said nothing.
</p>
<p>" Well, detective, that man was Mr. Richard

<p>Fetridge, of whom you may have heard a young
</p>
<p>36 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>lawyer of considerable property who has had deal-
</p>
<p>ings with our firm."
</p>
<p>" Richard Fetridge," repeated the detective
</p>
<p>slowly ; " well ? "
</p>
<p>" Mr. Fetridge stated, after considerable hesita-
</p>
<p>tion, which I couldn't help noticing, that he left
</p>
<p>Mr. North about five o'clock, after a business inter-
</p>
<p>view with him at our office. What the nature of
</p>
<p>that conference between them was I can't say.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fetridge and I did not like each other, I'm
</p>
<p>free to say it, and latterly I fancied that he grew
</p>
<p>even more curt and unpleasant in his manner
</p>
<p>toward me than before. Not that I cared for that,
</p>
<p>you understand ; I would not have given the mat-
</p>
<p>ter a moment's thought but for this terrible affair.
</p>
<p>Nor even now, if Fetridge's strange conference, and
</p>
<p>his hesitancy about saying where he left Mr.
</p>
<p>North, were not put in a more peculiar light by
</p>
<p>certain other facts that have come to my knowl-
</p>
<p>edge."
</p>
<p>" New facts ? '
</p>
<p>" Yes. Fetridge and North were seen together
</p>
<p>at a much later hour than five o'clock the afternoon
</p>
<p>of the murder."
</p>
<p>The statement was made pointedly, and the
</p>
<p>detective gave evidence of interest.
</p>
<p>" Are you sure ? " he asked.
</p>
<p>" Absolutely sure." Mr. Stackhouse's voice had
</p>
<p>sunk to a confidential whisper. " A business
</p>
<p>acquaintance whose word is beyond question has

</p>
<p>told me that he saw the two men walking up the
</p>
<p>LAMM'S COMPLICATED RELATIONS. 37
</p>
<p>Public Gardens at seven o'clock last evening,
</p>
<p>going in the direction of Marlboro Street."
</p>
<p>Lamm threw off the mask of reserve.
</p>
<p>"And that is, to your mind, a most valuable, a
</p>
<p>most important, piece of evidence ? In conjunction
</p>
<p>with Mr. Fetridge's conduct and course, you would
</p>
<p>consider it certainly very significant ? "
</p>
<p>" So significant," returned Stackhouse, " that but
</p>
<p>for the fact that I want to have the criminal so
</p>
<p>tangled in the mesh when he is caught that there
</p>
<p>can be no possible escape, I should before this
</p>
<p>have given the information to the police."
</p>
<p>" Then your theory is ? " suggested the detec-
</p>
<p>tive.
</p>
<p>" What theory could a man have under the cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances ? Richard Fetridge gained my part-
</p>
<p>ner's confidence got into the family on a friendly
</p>
<p>footing saw it was of no use to keep up his scheme
</p>
<p>of * working ' poor Mr. North any further, enticed
</p>
<p>him to this interview and subsequent conference at
</p>
<p>his house, and there murdered him."
</p>
<p>"Murdered him?" echoed Mr. Lamm, with not
</p>
<p>a shade of difference in the tone or his voice, quite
</p>
<p>as if he expected just such a revelation.
</p>
<p>" Not only murdered him," Stackhouse went on,
</p>
<p>his voice now full and strong under the stress of
</p>
<p>excitement ; " but tried to fasten the guilt of the
</p>
<p>crime upon me. Richard Fetridge wrote my name
</p>
<p>there in the blood of his victim Richard Fetridge,
</p>
<p>and no other. I feel as certain of it as if I had

</p>
<p>been a witness of the deed. He is my enemy ; I
</p>
<p>38 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>have felt it for a long time, and in the hostility,
</p>
<p>and no doubt his dread lest his scheming with
</p>
<p>North should come to light through my examina-
</p>
<p>tion of his affairs, he has done his utmost to dis-
</p>
<p>credit and dishonor me. Now you see why I want
</p>
<p>Richard Fetridge watched ; why I want him fol-
</p>
<p>lowed at every step ; why I want his guilt estab-
</p>
<p>lished by incontrovertible proof."
</p>
<p>By this time, Stackhouse, with his fists clenched,
</p>
<p>was pacing the floor.
</p>
<p>" First of all," said the detective, quietly observ-
</p>
<p>ing Stackhouse under his eyebrows " first of all,
</p>
<p>let us look at your own interests here. Perhaps
</p>
<p>you over-estimate the influence of that word written
</p>
<p>on the wall your name, as you declare. No one
</p>
<p>else has asserted this openly, Mr. Stackhouse ;
</p>
<p>but there have, no doubt, been whisperings to
</p>
<p>that effect, and it is the part of wisdom for
</p>
<p>you to silence, at once and effectually, any such
</p>
<p>charge, uttered, insinuated, or hinted at. You
</p>
<p>can, of course, prove your whereabouts at the
</p>
<p>time when the murder must have been com-
</p>
<p>mitted ? "
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm said this in a tone of business-like
</p>
<p>indifference.
</p>
<p>" You mean an alibi ? " asked Stackhouse, with
</p>
<p>something more of hesitancy than had characterized
</p>
<p>his statements hitherto.
</p>
<p>" Certainly."
</p>
<p>" Well, Mr. Lamm, as we are on confidential

<p>terms, talking as man to roan, I see no reason for
</p>
<p>LAMM'S COM PLICA TED RE LA TIONS. 39
</p>
<p>concealing the fact that my position as regards an
</p>
<p>alibi is a little peculiar."
</p>
<p>" Indeed ? " Mr. Lamm gave his pen another
</p>
<p>twirl.
</p>
<p>" I went to Vercelli's about half-past six o'clock
</p>
<p>for dinner with Mr. Sparhawk, one of my business
</p>
<p>friends. He was obliged to take a train out of
</p>
<p>town on the Providence road, and, after the dinner,
</p>
<p>I walked up and down the Public Garden, smoking
</p>
<p>a contemplative cigar."
</p>
<p>" Alone ? "
</p>
<p>" Yes. Just how long this might have taken I
</p>
<p>really cannot say."
</p>
<p>" About what time did you finish your dinner ? "
</p>
<p>" Somewhere about half-past seven o'clock.
</p>
<p>After this little walk, to help digest my dinner, I
</p>
<p>went towards Washington Street again. Then but
</p>
<p>why should I beat about the bush ? The evening
</p>
<p>was on my. hands, and I dropped in for a quiet
</p>
<p>little game with some friends at a house in Avory
</p>
<p>Street."
</p>
<p>" Yes ; I've heard of the place," said the detec-
</p>
<p>tive dryly.
</p>
<p>" There I stayed until it was getting nearly two
</p>
<p>o'clock, when I walked into the Adams House, and
</p>
<p>slept till breakfast."
</p>
<p>" Umha ! " Mr. Lamni seemed to be considering
</p>
<p>a point. " About what time did you visit the
</p>
<p>Avory Street house ? It may be important as bear-
</p>
<p>ing on the question of alibi."

</p>
<p>" Not until after nine. I can be sure of that, for
</p>
<p>40 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>I distinctly remember hearing the bells ring at that
</p>
<p>hour while I was in the street."
</p>
<p>" At all events," said the detective, " your friends
</p>
<p>can testify, if it should be necessary, through any
</p>
<p>complication of circumstances, when you joined
</p>
<p>your party, and how long you remained there ? "
</p>
<p>" Undoubtedly." Mr. Stackhouse sat a moment
</p>
<p>thinking in his turn. " I suppose no reliable opin-
</p>
<p>ion has yet been given as to the time when Paul
</p>
<p>North came to his end ? " He looked a trifle un-
</p>
<p>easy as he put the question.
</p>
<p>" We must await the report of the autopsy on that
</p>
<p>point," rejoined the detective. " It seems to be
</p>
<p>taken for granted that Mr. North died some time
</p>
<p>between 6 P.M. and 9 A.M. by the papers. Only
</p>
<p>the decision of the medical examiner, however, can
</p>
<p>have weight in the matter. If I can ascertain its
</p>
<p>drift in advance," added Mr. Lamm, as if struck by
</p>
<p>a sudden thought, " I will advise you at once."
</p>
<p>" Then you really think you can undertake the
</p>
<p>case ? " Stackhouse asked eagerly.
</p>
<p>" I have decided to," said Lamm dryly. " I am
</p>
<p>very glad you came here, Mr. Stackhouse. I think
</p>
<p>I should have been led into serious error regarding
</p>
<p>this case if you had not come. However, it is all
</p>
<p>right. I shall make an exception to an almost un-
</p>
<p>broken business rule, and undertake the case for a
</p>
<p>few days at least. If I find I cannot continue the
</p>
<p>work, I will promptly notify you."
</p>
<p>Evidently gratified at receiving this assurance,

</p>
<p>Stackhouse took his leave.
</p>
<p>LAMM 'S COM PLICA TED RELA TIONS. 41
</p>
<p>Left to himself, the detective indulged in a mo-
</p>
<p>mentary relief of his feelings. He took up his hat,
</p>
<p>looked into it, smiled into it, and put it on his head.
</p>
<p>After this performance, he became as indifferent
</p>
<p>and serene as if the complication in which he had
</p>
<p>so readily involved himself were the commonest
</p>
<p>sort of experience with him. But, as a matter of
</p>
<p>fact, it was not. Mr. Lamm was not in the habit
</p>
<p>of working for both sides of a case at the same
</p>
<p>time, and he was only induced to break his rule in
</p>
<p>this instance by the sudden suspicion that Fetridge,
</p>
<p>not Stackhouse, was the criminal. He had strong
</p>
<p>objections to identifying himself with the cause of
</p>
<p>the murderer when he might be employed in the
</p>
<p>interests of justice.
</p>
<p>" I'll soon find out," he said to himself, " which
</p>
<p>of you is the villain, and send in my resignation to
</p>
<p>that man at once."
</p>
<p>But it did not prove to be such an easy task as
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm had anticipated.
</p>
<p>The detective left his office almost upon the heels
</p>
<p>of his second client, and, shadowing him a short
</p>
<p>distance, saw him enter a branch office of the
</p>
<p>Western Union Telegraph Company. It is a very
</p>
<p>strict rule with the company that despatches are to
</p>
<p>be considered confidential, and woe to the man who
</p>
<p>betrays this confidence and gets caught at it. But
</p>
<p>it is a pretty difficult thing to restrain a man from
</p>
<p>accommodating a friend when he is sure that the
</p>
<p>friend will never allow him to suffer thereby ; and

</p>
<p>so, through the courtesy of the operator, who was
</p>
<p>42 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>upon Mr. Lamm's list of " availables," the despatch
</p>
<p>written by the junior partner was, soon after that
</p>
<p>gentleman's departure, in the hands of the detec-
</p>
<p>tive. It was addressed to Comfort Harwood,
</p>
<p>Swampscott, and contained these words :
</p>
<p>" Am very busy with matters growing out of sad
</p>
<p>event. Will come by five o'clock train to Phillips
</p>
<p>Beach."
</p>
<p>The reading of this telegram modified John
</p>
<p>Datum's plans. If he wished to shadow Stackhouse,
</p>
<p>there were two courses open to him. One was to
</p>
<p>follow him through all the details of his operation
</p>
<p>till he got to Swampscott, and the other was to
</p>
<p>anticipate his arrival there. He adopted the latter
</p>
<p>as the more promising.
</p>
<p>" With all due respect to you, Mr. Fetridge," he
</p>
<p>said to himself, " I should like to begin the case
</p>
<p>with an understanding of the- motive, and if it's a
</p>
<p>family affair, as you say, why the family will be a
</p>
<p>very good point to start at. Perhaps I shall find
</p>
<p>them less delicate than you are about it who
</p>
<p>knows ? For at such times emotional excitement
</p>
<p>loosens everybody's tongues."
</p>
<p>He consulted a time-table and hastened to the
</p>
<p>railway station in Causeway Street. In fifteen
</p>
<p>minutes he was in the train going towards Swamp-
</p>
<p>scott.
</p>
<p>He went into the smoking car, pulled out a cigar,
</p>
<p>and was soon lost in a cloud of smoke. The effort
</p>
<p>stimulated his ideas, and when he had got them in

</p>
<p>logical order he produced a capacious memorandum
</p>
<p>LAMM 'S COMPLICA TED RELA TIONS. 43
</p>
<p>book, and recorded therein with a stylographic pen
</p>
<p>a series of hieroglyphics. As the occasion for
</p>
<p>secrecy has long ago expired, Mr. Lamm's notes
</p>
<p>may be transcribed.
</p>
<p>1. Stackhouse has no alibi between seven and
</p>
<p>nine of Thursday night. Get from medical ex-
</p>
<p>aminer probable time of death.
</p>
<p>2. Fetridge turns away when forced to speak
</p>
<p>about North's daughters. Is it Marion or
</p>
<p>Stella ?
</p>
<p>3. If Marion, is there any other reason necessary
</p>
<p>for enmity between two men ?
</p>
<p>With this brief indication of his train of thoughts,
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm's record ceased.
</p>
<p>Drawing from his pocket a scarcely dry copy of
</p>
<p>the paper containing the first chapter of the tragic
</p>
<p>mystery in which he was embarked, he ran his eye
</p>
<p>carefully through the meager details thus far pub-
</p>
<p>lished. He seemed pleased when he saw by whom
</p>
<p>the report was signed.
</p>
<p>" K. F. Thomas ? Indeed ? I'll look him up at
</p>
<p>once. That fellow knows more people and their
</p>
<p>histories than a biographical dictionary. Perhaps
</p>
<p>he can tell me all I want to know about Richard
</p>
<p>Fetridge."
</p>
<p>At this point in his soliloquy, Mr. Lamm could
</p>
<p>not repress a start of surprise. At that very in-
</p>
<p>stant, the man whose name was on his mind's lips
</p>
<p>entered the smoking car, and sat down in one of
</p>
<p>the forward seats.

<p>CHAPTER IV.
</p>
<p>AN UNBIDDEN GUEST.
</p>
<p>IN the appearance of John Lamm, detective, as
</p>
<p>he rode towards Swampscott, there was nothing
</p>
<p>to denote his especial calling. He might have been
</p>
<p>a prosperous merchant or a consulting lawyer or a
</p>
<p>skillful civil engineer, so far as manner and bearing
</p>
<p>were concerned.
</p>
<p>Firmness and executive ability, however, were
</p>
<p>characteristics that no one who looked attentively
</p>
<p>at the brown-haired, broad-shouldered, keen-eyed,
</p>
<p>stalwart man could possibly fail to note.
</p>
<p>In his suave and gentlemanly manner, too, in
</p>
<p>his magnetism, his geniality, and his ability to be-
</p>
<p>come hail fellow well met with the most opposite
</p>
<p>social types, might be read the secret of his extra-
</p>
<p>ordinary success in the profession.
</p>
<p>Alighting at the Phillips Beach station, with a
</p>
<p>large contingent of sojourners, Mr. Lamm appeared
</p>
<p>to be quite as familiar with the p'lace as the rest of
</p>
<p>the hurrying throng.
</p>
<p>In order to permit Fetridge to get well out of
</p>
<p>the way, he stopped to inquire of the station agent
</p>
<p>where the Norths lived.
</p>
<p>" Just up the street, yonder," the agent replied.

<p>46 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>" Sad news for them, isn't it ? The whole household
</p>
<p>is upset. There's Moffet, their ' inside man,' now,
</p>
<p>on the platform, looking after the train."
</p>
<p>In a moment Mr. Lamm was at the side of the
</p>
<p>bewildered Moffett, and talking to him as if he had
</p>
<p>known the portly man of bottles and carving knives
</p>
<p>all his life.
</p>
<p>" I am glad to have met you," he said. " I was
</p>
<p>a friend of Mr. North, and take a great interest in the
</p>
<p>family. Poor girls ! I couldn't bear to break in
</p>
<p>upon their grief, but I feel that at a time like this a
</p>
<p>friend should do something."
</p>
<p>Moffett clutched his shoulder.
</p>
<p>" Oh, sir," he whispered, with an aroma of some-
</p>
<p>thing stimulating by the way of flavour for the
</p>
<p>words, " if you are a friend, you can't do better
</p>
<p>than come up to the house. I have been waiting
</p>
<p>here in hopes that Mr. Stackhouse would return.
</p>
<p>But he doesn't ; and there they are at the house in
</p>
<p>a terrible condition, sir."
</p>
<p>" Overcome by the sad news ? " Mr. Lamm said,
</p>
<p>as they walked up the street.
</p>
<p>" Oh, sir, there's been some trouble there. I
</p>
<p>don't know what scenes between the women.
</p>
<p>They don't understand what to do, sir. The serv-
</p>
<p>ants are all upset too. If it weren't for me, sir,
</p>
<p>nobody would think of going to watch for Mr.
</p>
<p>Stackhouse. It's his not coming that worries me,
</p>
<p>sir."
</p>
<p>Moffett was ordinarily a very discreet man, but,

</p>
<p>under the excitement of the time, he recounted
</p>
<p>AN UNBIDDEN GUEST. 47
</p>
<p>such an extraordinary though incoherent story of
</p>
<p>what had taken place at the Norths' that Lamm
</p>
<p>was nonplussed at his disclosures, and was moved
</p>
<p>to consider seriously what was best to be done.
</p>
<p>Then came one of those inspirations which, by
</p>
<p>reason of their boldness and audacity, may lead
</p>
<p>either to great success or absolute disaster. Might
</p>
<p>he not enter the house unknown to its occupants ?
</p>
<p>It was indeed a bold thing to do a thing which
</p>
<p>John Lamm, detective, would not do in any circum-
</p>
<p>stances, but for his belief that Moffett's disjointed
</p>
<p>utterances implied a state of affairs that demanded
</p>
<p>investigation.
</p>
<p>Yielding to the earnest wish of Moffett, the
</p>
<p>friend of the family entered the house through the
</p>
<p>servants' door, the " inside man " clinging to his
</p>
<p>arm with a nervous grasp.
</p>
<p>Without delay, Mr. Lamm was escorted to the
</p>
<p>pantry-room by the portly Moffett, who moved
</p>
<p>lightly, though slowly. They entered this sanc-
</p>
<p>tuary of the " inside man " without meeting any of
</p>
<p>the household ; for, of course, Moffett had the
</p>
<p>necessary keys.
</p>
<p>It had been observed by Mr. Lamm that the
</p>
<p>" inside man " had been taking something for his
</p>
<p>stomach's sake ; but the detective understood the
</p>
<p>strain under which the man had been laboring, and
</p>
<p>felt sure, from his appearance, that he was far from
</p>
<p>being addicted to strong drink.
</p>
<p>Moffett had assumed an air of importance and

<p>profound mystery that would infallibly have

</p>
<p>aroused comment and suspicion had he met any
</p>
<p>of the servants. But, fortunately, both were now
</p>
<p>in the pantry-room with the door locked.
</p>
<p>The detective was accustomed to meet all sorts
</p>
<p>and conditions of men, but he found it hard to
</p>
<p>refrain from laughing outright at the change in
</p>
<p>Mr. Moffett's looks as he faced him, after the pantry-
</p>
<p>room door had been locked, and held up a warning
</p>
<p>finger. But he said solemnly :
</p>
<p>" Moffett, you're a man o*: sense, therefore I
</p>
<p>make no long explanations, but tell you frankly at
</p>
<p>once that I am a representative of the authorities
</p>
<p>don't start, Moffett and am sent here in the inter-
</p>
<p>ests of justice."
</p>
<p>" Justice ! " murmured the butler, looking help-
</p>
<p>lessly at him.
</p>
<p>" Here is my badge," continued the detective,
</p>
<p>throwing back his coat. "And now it is absolutely
</p>
<p>necessary, Moffett, that I should have the run of
</p>
<p>the house watch, without anybody's suspecting the
</p>
<p>fact, all that goes on, and have an eye to affairs
</p>
<p>generally. I have come to you in this way, Moffett,
</p>
<p>because I've been told that you are a very discreet
</p>
<p>man. Unless you repeat what I have told you,
</p>
<p>nobody in the house need know of my remaining
</p>
<p>here, nor have any idea of the real object which
</p>
<p>brings me."
</p>
<p>" But I don't like, sir," stammered the butler, who
</p>
<p>already began to tremble.
</p>
<p>" You must like it, Moffett," emphasized the

</p>
<p>take you in charge, but I am fully prepared to go
</p>
<p>as far as that if you are not sensible enough to see
</p>
<p>the reasonableness of my first proposal. There !
</p>
<p>I see by your look you understand the situation.
</p>
<p>Very good. Now, where is the best, the most cen-
</p>
<p>tral, place in the house, in which you can stow me,
</p>
<p>do you think, Moffett ? "
</p>
<p>The " inside man " of Mr. Paul North's estab-
</p>
<p>lishment was a picture of perplexity and despair.
</p>
<p>" Central place ! Stow you ! " he murmured
</p>
<p>helplessly, puffing like a fat porpoise ; "but what
</p>
<p>will Miss Harwood say and Mrs. Stackhouse,
</p>
<p>and and Mr. Stackhouse ? No, no ; it aint
</p>
<p>regular. I'm afraid it aint regular, sir."
</p>
<p>" Oh, I guess you misunderstand me, Moffett ;
</p>
<p>misunderstand me completely," said Mr. Lamm,
</p>
<p>calmly crossing his legs as he sat in the butler's
</p>
<p>chair. "It's to spare the ladies worry, trouble,
</p>
<p>and excitement that I came to you. I'll be frank
</p>
<p>with you ; because I can easily see you're a man of
</p>
<p>discretion, and can keep a secret. I am expecting
</p>
<p>the murderer of Mr. North to call here, and I want
</p>
<p>to be where I can arrest him quietly and without
</p>
<p>undue excitement, which you wouldn't want your-
</p>
<p>self in a family like this, now, would you, Moffett ? "
</p>
<p>" But but they the servants might know
</p>
<p>you're here. They may have seen you come in.
</p>
<p>They"
</p>
<p>" Oh, pshaw, Moffett, you can slam the front
</p>
<p>door, and if any questions are asked, you can say

<p>that I went out that way. Come, come, Moffett,
</p>
<p>5 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>be a man. Don't shake so. Everything will be
</p>
<p>done quietly and in order, I can assure you."
</p>
<p>" And this man, this murderer," stammered Mof-
</p>
<p>fett, who was well-nigh frightened out of his wits ;
</p>
<p>" is he violent, sir ? Wont he try to shoot some-
</p>
<p>body else ? Wont he I think, perhaps, if I went
</p>
<p>out down the street a little while so as not to be
</p>
<p>obliged to answer any questions "
</p>
<p>" An excellent idea, Moffett," interrupted the
</p>
<p>detective, who was really beginning to be alarmed
</p>
<p>by the undue agitation of the affrighted steward.
</p>
<p>" But, hold on. Wait till I have done with you.
</p>
<p>Where are the women folk ? "
</p>
<p>" In their rooms, sir, upstairs."
</p>
<p>" Umha ! Do you happen to have any photo-
</p>
<p>graphs of the young ladies handy ? "
</p>
<p>" There are some in the parlor. Yes, sir."
</p>
<p>"Get them for me. Bring them here immedi-
</p>
<p>ately."
</p>
<p>Moffett hastened out, and was back in a moment
</p>
<p>with the desired articles.
</p>
<p>" Umha ! And this roguish-looking face is
</p>
<p>Miss Stella, eh ? "
</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."
</p>
<p>" She doesn't resemble her sister much, eh ? "
</p>
<p>" That has been often remarked, sir."
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm might have said further, if he had
</p>
<p>deemed it proper, that they were two remarkably
</p>
<p>pretty girls. There were a brightness and a sparkle
</p>
<p>about the younger face which betrayed at once the

</p>
<p>sessor. The head of the elder was of a classic mould.
</p>
<p>There was something of the Medea expression in
</p>
<p>the regular features. It was a trifle too stern
</p>
<p>too unyielding in its outlines. The observer
</p>
<p>said at once, " That woman has a will of her
</p>
<p>own."
</p>
<p>When Mr. Lamm had made sufficient mental
</p>
<p>notes upon the pictures, he returned them to the
</p>
<p>servant, and they were immediately replaced in
</p>
<p>their customary repositories. This time Mr. Lamm
</p>
<p>made so bold as to cautiously accompany the but-
</p>
<p>ler to the front of the house. The hush of a great
</p>
<p>calamity reigned everywhere. The house was
</p>
<p>built on a terrace, and the servants' quarters were
</p>
<p>on the floor below. That particular story was
</p>
<p>deserted. At a glance the detective took in the
</p>
<p>possibilities of the place. All the rooms opened
</p>
<p>from the wide hallway, separated therefrom by
</p>
<p>portfires. This was excellent for his designs, if he
</p>
<p>could find a suitable hiding-place. His restless eye
</p>
<p>lighted upon a stained-glass window at the back of
</p>
<p>the hall.
</p>
<p>" What is back of that ? " he whispered.
</p>
<p>" Toilet room, sir."
</p>
<p>" Is that window movable ? "
</p>
<p>" I believe so, sir ; but it is never moved.' 1
</p>
<p>"Where does that room open from?"
</p>
<p>" From the back hall."
</p>
<p>" Very well, Moffett. I will lock myself in there.
</p>
<p>If there are any inquiries, you have accidentally

<p>twisted the key off in the lock, and will go for a
</p>
<p>52 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>locksmith to repair the damage. The locksmith
</p>
<p>will not be in. You understand."
</p>
<p>Moffett, who was becoming resigned to his fate,
</p>
<p>though his teeth still exhibited a tendency to
</p>
<p>chatter, led the way to the room. Standing upon
</p>
<p>a chair, the detective examined the window. To
</p>
<p>his delight he found that it could be moved up and
</p>
<p>down. He took the liberty of making a narrow
</p>
<p>crevice between the lower sash and the sill. Reas-
</p>
<p>sured by the presence of another window opening
</p>
<p>upon the outer world, Mr. Lamm, who was quite
</p>
<p>alive to the bold risk he was taking, earnestly
</p>
<p>impressed upon Mr. Moffett the necessity for
</p>
<p>secrecy, and locked himself into the room.
</p>
<p>The sound of a key turning in the latch-lock of
</p>
<p>the front door brought about a responsive stir from,
</p>
<p>the story above. There was a rustle of skirts, and
</p>
<p>a woman, who Lamm imagined had been watching
</p>
<p>at a window, came down the stairs before the outer
</p>
<p>door was opened.
</p>
<p>" Oh, Mr. Stackhouse ! " It was a querulous,
</p>
<p>tearful woman's voice, and spoke in one of those
</p>
<p>sibilant whispers that distress the hearer more than
</p>
<p>would the loudest of tones. " Isn't it awful ? My
</p>
<p>poor brother-in-law ! Why haven't they sent the
</p>
<p>body ? It's not come down with you ? Oh, dear
</p>
<p>me, dear me, it seems as though I would go out of
</p>
<p>my head ! Why, Thornton, Thornton, you don't
</p>
<p>know half what I've been through ! "

<p>Mr. Stackhouse placed his hat and coat on a chair.
</p>
<p>AN UNBIDDEN GUEST. S3
</p>
<p>" You don't know what I've been through," he
</p>
<p>said, in meaning tones. " Why is the house shut
</p>
<p>up like this? On such a night the windows at
</p>
<p>least should be open. Marion and Stella are up-
</p>
<p>stairs together, I suppose ? "
</p>
<p>" Yes, yes. But, oh, you don't know how I
</p>
<p>worried about them both. And then the dreadful
</p>
<p>news of poor Paul's death came on top of my trouble
</p>
<p>about them. It's a mercy I'm not crazy at this
</p>
<p>moment."
</p>
<p>" What have Marion and Stella been about, eh ?"
</p>
<p>asked Stackhouse sharply.
</p>
<p>" Oh, Thornton, they went away yesterday, one
</p>
<p>after another, without saying a word. I never
</p>
<p>knew them to go to the city alone that way before.
</p>
<p>And, oh, Thornton, they didn't come back till the
</p>
<p>late train. I sat up for them with the creeps all
</p>
<p>over me the whole evening. And such strange
</p>
<p>actions when they did come ! Stella went up to
</p>
<p>her room crying. Marion wouldn't say a word to
</p>
<p>explain, and went upstairs looking oh ! so
</p>
<p>white ! "
</p>
<p>" Well, well." returned Stackhouse impatiently.
</p>
<p>"It's of no particular consequence. We have
</p>
<p>other things to occupy our time now."
</p>
<p>" Yes, indeed, Thornton," said Aunt Comfort,
</p>
<p>with a sob. She was a portly woman, but exceed-
</p>
<p>ingly nervous and fidgety in spite of her size, and
</p>
<p>she made half a hundred purposeless movements in
</p>
<p>a moment when excited. " Oh, the body ! Where

</p>
<p>is it ? You must go straight back to Boston and
</p>
<p>54 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>get it. Those body snatchers are terribly sly
</p>
<p>creatures. Thornton, did you read in yesterday's
</p>
<p>paper "
</p>
<p>Mr. Stackhouse could endure no more.
</p>
<p>" Nonsense, woman ! " he interrupted sternly.
</p>
<p>" Leave this matter to me and attend to your house-
</p>
<p>hold duties. But tell me," he added immediately,
</p>
<p>in a voice which he vainly endeavored to render
</p>
<p>indifferent, " what sent the girls off to the city
</p>
<p>yesterday afternoon ? Did you observe nothing ?
</p>
<p>What did they say?"
</p>
<p>" Oh, Thornton ! Hush ! They are com-
</p>
<p>ing."
</p>
<p>True enough, there was a sound of a door clos-
</p>
<p>ing, the rustle of skirts, and the echo of voices
</p>
<p>simultaneously floating down the staircase from the
</p>
<p>region above.
</p>
<p>Stackhouse took a step forward, but started back
</p>
<p>immediately, looking upward in a puzzled, appre-
</p>
<p>hensive way.
</p>
<p>" Oh, don't ! don't ! don't ! I beg of you,
</p>
<p>Marion. On my knees I beg of you ! "
</p>
<p>A woman's voice raised in that keen, penetrating
</p>
<p>fashion that reveals a climax, an outburst of re-
</p>
<p>pressed emotion, uttering such words as these,
</p>
<p>could not be a common sound in such a house as
</p>
<p>this. Stackhouse, whose face was in direct line of
</p>
<p>the detective's vision, looked as if a bombshell had
</p>
<p>burst at his feet. He was speechless with wonder
</p>
<p>and dismay.

<p>" Stella," returned an inflexible voice, " I com-
</p>
<p>AN UNBIDDEN GUEST. 55
</p>
<p>mand you to let me go. I know what my duty is,
</p>
<p>and I shall do it."
</p>
<p>The other woman might have been silenced by
</p>
<p>fear or overawed by the sternness of her to whom
</p>
<p>she had appealed, for she made no further outcry.
</p>
<p>The footsteps were already on the stairs ; a white
</p>
<p>skirt fluttered by the railing. Again Stackhouse
</p>
<p>took a step forward, and again he stopped. It may
</p>
<p>have been a gesture on his wife's part or something
</p>
<p>that he saw in her face. Certain it is that he
</p>
<p>became a shade whiter, and that in his effort to
</p>
<p>speak his tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of
</p>
<p>his mouth. He stammered two words :
</p>
<p>" Why, Marion ! "
</p>
<p>" Don't speak to me ! Don't touch me ! Never
</p>
<p>call me by that name again ! "
</p>
<p>The tone was certainly not a loud one. It could
</p>
<p>not be said that there was a theatrical ring about
</p>
<p>the manner of enunciation. The words were low,
</p>
<p>distinct, and uttered with such calm, terrible inten-
</p>
<p>sity that, blase as he was, Detective Lamm experi-
</p>
<p>enced a genuine thrill. He felt himself in the
</p>
<p>presence of a remarkable woman, and the same
</p>
<p>sort of keen and breathless interest with which he
</p>
<p>had followed great acting on the stage took pos-
</p>
<p>session of him.
</p>
<p>" Oh, Marion ! " It was the sister who spoke,
</p>
<p>and the tone was quite heart-broken and hopeless.
</p>
<p>Stackhouse seemed to recover from his tempo-
</p>
<p>rary paralysis.

<p>" You had better go to your room, Stella," he
</p>
<p>5 6 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>said, in a voice but barely audible. " I must talk
</p>
<p>with Marion alone."
</p>
<p>" Do not stir a step ! " commanded the other
</p>
<p>woman, as Stella went towards the door. " I wish
</p>
<p>you to hear what little I have to say to this man.
</p>
<p>You, too, Aunt Comfort. Don't stand in the door-
</p>
<p>way there, looking so frightened. Come back.
</p>
<p>The more witnesses the better."
</p>
<p>The defiant, reckless voice that spoke was that
</p>
<p>of a determined woman who had settled her mind
</p>
<p>to a purpose and who would follow it unswervingly
</p>
<p>if it brought her to her death.
</p>
<p>There was a brief interval, marked only by
</p>
<p>Stella's sobbing, and the elder woman's wheezy
</p>
<p>ejaculations, uttered like signal guns almost every
</p>
<p>second.
</p>
<p>" Marion Stackhouse, have you taken leave of
</p>
<p>your senses ? " faltered the business associate of
</p>
<p>the late Paul North.
</p>
<p>" No, I have just found them. Do not dare to
</p>
<p>associate your name with mine. This is the last
</p>
<p>time I will ever speak to you. Witness, Stella, and
</p>
<p>you, too, Aunt Comfort. From this hour we live
</p>
<p>apart."
</p>
<p>" But Marion," interrupted the woman, " remem-
</p>
<p>ber your promise at the altar ! You are not feeling
</p>

</p>
<p>AN UNBIDDEN GUEST. 57
</p>
<p>you should know the terrible cause that impels
</p>
<p>me. My contempt for this man whom I have called
</p>
<p>husband "
</p>
<p>" What fiend possesses you ? " interrupted Stack-
</p>
<p>house, unable to restrain himself. " Called your
</p>
<p>husband ? What do you mean ? "
</p>
<p>" A name is all I need to speak," responded
</p>
<p>Marion, scorn and contempt expressed in every
</p>
<p>word : " Marie Moissot ! "
</p>
<p>The name burst from Marion's lips like the ac-
</p>
<p>cusation of an avenging angel. It is probable
</p>
<p>that Stackhouse staggered under the force of the
</p>
<p>blow. Mr. Lamm, who, without an instant's delay,
</p>
<p>turned his attention to putting that queer-sounding
</p>
<p>name upon paper (" Marie Moyso " he wrote it),
</p>
<p>did not see him again for a brief space ; and in that
</p>
<p>time he may have slightly recovered from the first
</p>
<p>violence of his betrayed emotions. He was still
</p>
<p>agitated enough in all conscience. This man
</p>
<p>Thornton Stackhouse, whom Lamm well knew to
</p>
<p>be in his ordinary walk of life no more self-betray-
</p>
<p>ing than the polished surface of a mirror, had been
</p>
<p>so affected and overwhelmed by what his wife had
</p>
<p>said to him that he was weaker than a child. He
</p>
<p>tried to shake off his growing terrors. He endeav-
</p>
<p>ored to smile, to laugh, to pass over the affair as
</p>
<p>a joke, but the effort was a ghastly failure.
</p>
<p>" Marion ! " he murmured. " Marion ! Who
</p>
<p>has told you ? What scoundrel has maligned me
</p>
<p>to my own wife?"

</p>
<p>" Silence, sir ! I am not your wife. This was
</p>
<p>58 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>my father's house. Either you or I must leave it.
</p>
<p>Which ? Choose this minute."
</p>
<p>" Marion ! Calm yourself, I beseech you ?
</p>
<p>Think of the effect, the occasion, the time. Who
</p>
<p>knows what people would say ?"
</p>
<p>" I do not care, sir. If you do, you should have
</p>
<p>thought of it before. It is too late now."
</p>
<p>He turned his white face towards her. Lamm
</p>
<p>marked plainly in the ample light how his lips
</p>
<p>trembled, how his eyes gleamed.
</p>
<p>" Marion," he said in a fierce undertone, " are you
</p>
<p>enough mistress of yourself to think what my leav-
</p>
<p>ing this house at such a time will mean to the gos-
</p>
<p>sips ? Can you not see that even I might be accused
</p>
<p>of complicity in your father's death ? "
</p>
<p>" And who should be, if you are not ? " the wo-
</p>
<p>man retorted, in a vibrant tone that pierced the
</p>
<p>detective's ears like a thunderbolt. There were
</p>
<p>simultaneous cries from her three visible auditors.
</p>
<p>The detective swallowed his emotion with a painful
</p>
<p>effort. He had participated in many an unexpected
</p>
<p>and stirring scene in his time, but a domestic drama
</p>
<p>of this nature in a house like this, with actors such
</p>
<p>as these, filled him with the liveliest amazement.
</p>
<p>Of all things he had expected or hoped for, this
</p>
<p>was certainly the last, the most impossible.
</p>
<p>For several seconds after his wife had delivered
</p>
<p>herself of this terrible taunt, Thornton Stackhouse
</p>
<p>seemed vainly endeavoring to articulate. Then
</p>
<p>with a sudden movement he seized his hat and

</p>
<p>turned to the door. The voice which now came to
</p>
<p>AN UNBIDDEN GUEST. 59
</p>
<p>him was so unlike his natural tones that Lamm
</p>
<p>would not have recognized it had the speaker been
</p>
<p>out of view.
</p>
<p>" So be it ! " he said. " Nobody will ever know
</p>
<p>what this is to me or how I have loved you, Marion.
</p>
<p>But so be it. If my own wife turns from me, who
</p>
<p>will have mercy on me ? "
</p>
<p>The door opened and closed violently behind the
</p>
<p>partner of the late Paul North.
</p>
<p>Did he speak for effect or were the emotions that
</p>
<p>inspired his words genuine ? It is certain that the
</p>
<p>amazed detective became strongly prejudiced in
</p>
<p>his favor.
</p>
<p>There was an interval of silence, and then a flut-
</p>
<p>ter of skirts and a white, white face appeared at
</p>
<p>the foot of the stairs. Lamm knew at once that
</p>
<p>that proud, imperious countenance, the scornful
</p>
<p>red mouth, the flashing blue eyes, belonged to
</p>
<p>Marion Stackhouse. But, great powers ! could
</p>
<p>that be her natural expression ? And then he saw
</p>
<p>what was the matter. She reeled, caught at the
</p>
<p>railing, threw up her arms, and fell like a log to
</p>
<p>the floor.
</p>
<p>So indeed this stoical woman was made of flesh

</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.
</p>
<p>AND WHO IS THE AFORESAID MARIE ?
</p>
<p>"TVETECTIVE JOHN LAMM, whose experience
</p>
<p>LJ had rendered his views of life rather more
</p>
<p>broad than the prosy theorist who judges the world
</p>
<p>from his commonplace associates, was not unaware
</p>
<p>of the existence of the emotional drama in real life.
</p>
<p>Too often had it been his melancholy duty to draw
</p>
<p>aside the conventional curtain with which the mem-
</p>
<p>ber of modern society endeavors to conceal his
</p>
<p>serious affairs from the eyes of his neighbor, and to
</p>
<p>catch a fleeting glimpse of the contending passions
</p>
<p>which were seething about the presumably quiet
</p>
<p>hearthstone.
</p>
<p>The scene which he had just witnessed did not
</p>
<p>therefore seem incredible in itself, but the time and
</p>
<p>circumstances at and in which it had occurred ren-
</p>
<p>dered it, in John Lamm's estimation, of a most
</p>
<p>peculiar and astounding nature. As yet his ideas
</p>
<p>were too disorderly and confused to enable him to
</p>
<p>draw logical deductions. The moment had not yet
</p>
<p>come for theories and explanations. He could only
</p>
<p>stand still with bated breath and rapid pulse and
</p>
<p>await the outcome of the strange situation.
</p>
<p>When Marion fainted, Stella, pale and trembling,

</p>
<p>and looking very unlike her smiling and roguish
</p>
<p>self, as the photograph had proclaimed her, ran
</p>
<p>down to her assistance, and while Aunt Comfort
</p>
<p>was ambling aimlessly, wringing her fat hands and
</p>
<p>reflecting audibly that she couldn't see why on
</p>
<p>earth she wasn't already crazy, she was making re-
</p>
<p>peated and intelligent efforts at restoration. The
</p>
<p>sprinkling of water, which Stella procured without
</p>
<p>summoning the servants, eventually having the
</p>
<p>effect of causing the eyelids, upon which some of
</p>
<p>the drops fell, to unclose, Marion murmured some
</p>
<p>incoherent words, arose, and with her sister's
</p>
<p>help, staggered to a chair, where she sat for several
</p>
<p>minutes as motionless and as speechless as if she
</p>
<p>had been in a trance. Aunt Comfort, suddenly
</p>
<p>awakening to her responsibilities, ran to fan her
</p>
<p>with a book cover, murmuring continuously sooth-
</p>
<p>ing and reassuring expressions.
</p>
<p>Marion did not appear to notice her, though the
</p>
<p>detective saw the girl's eyes more than once follow-
</p>
<p>ing her sister's motions in a relentless, questioning
</p>
<p>way. Mr. Lamm hoped for some conversation
</p>
<p>which would throw light on the dramatic charade
</p>
<p>that had been enacted in his presence, but he was
</p>
<p>disappointed. Nothing'came but the uninterrupted
</p>
<p>monologue of wheezy Aunt Comfort. Neither of
</p>
<p>the sisters spoke other than in monos) r llables, until
</p>
<p>Marion, suddenly flushing under some words of the
</p>
<p>elderly lady solicitous for Thornton Stackhouse,
</p>
<p>said imperiously :

</p>
<p>" Stop ! stop ! I tell you ! Not another word.
</p>
<p>62 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>This house was not his. It was my father's. What-
</p>
<p>ever there may be in it which belongs to him must
</p>
<p>be sent to him. If he ever comes here again I
</p>
<p>shall go away. If he has given any orders con-
</p>
<p>cerning my father's funeral they must be counter-
</p>
<p>manded. It would be a sacrilege which I could
</p>
<p>not permit."
</p>
<p>Aunt Comfort seemed to be too much alarmed to
</p>
<p>make any reply or to put any inquiry, and whatever
</p>
<p>remonstrance Stella had to offer against her sis-
</p>
<p>ter's extraordinary conduct must have been uttered
</p>
<p>before the arrival of Stackhouse, for it was evident
</p>
<p>that she had become hopelessly resigned to the
</p>
<p>situation.
</p>
<p>A ring at the door bell fell with startling effect
</p>
<p>upon the silence of the house. Stella fled precipi-
</p>
<p>tately to the upper regions, while Aunt Comfort,
</p>
<p>with her hand on her heart, stared apprehensively
</p>
<p>at the door. It was Marion herself who waved
</p>
<p>back the advancing servant with an imperious
</p>
<p>gesture and went resolutely to answer the
</p>
<p>summons.
</p>
<p>" Bless me ! " Mr. Lamm exclaimed within him-
</p>
<p>self. " It's my risky client ! "
</p>
<p>And behold on the threshold, hat in hand, a bit
</p>
<p>flushed and embarrassed, and with an expression
</p>
<p>of lively solicitude as befitted the occasion, Mr.
</p>
<p>Richard Fetridge !
</p>
<p>" You come at a sad time, sir," murmured Aunt
</p>
<p>Comfort, walking aimlessly between the door and

<p>the staircase.
</p>
<p>AND WHO IS THE AFORESAID MARIE? 63
</p>
<p>" I am very glad you are here, Mr. Fetridge,"
</p>
<p>Marion said, in collected tones. " If we ever
</p>
<p>needed a friend, it is at this moment."
</p>
<p>" I need not say with what eagerness I shall avail
</p>
<p>myself of any opportunity to aid you, Mrs. Stack-
</p>
<p>house," he said earnestly.
</p>
<p>She looked him directly in the eyes.
</p>
<p>" Not Mrs. Stackhouse, Marion North."
</p>
<p>He made a painful effort to appear unembar-
</p>
<p>rassed, but it was quite evident that he was gravely
</p>
<p>alarmed.
</p>
<p>" You you know " he stammered.
</p>
<p>" Everything," she returned, with a forlorn, bitter
</p>
<p>accent.
</p>
<p>" Good heavens ! " he ejaculated, in ill-concealed
</p>
<p>alarm. " Who told you ? "
</p>
<p>She made no reply in words, but with a simple
</p>
<p>gesture indicated the portiere at the right. In a
</p>
<p>moment the two people had disappeared from view,
</p>
<p>leaving Aunt Comfort staring like a petrified figure
</p>
<p>in a museum at the drawn curtain. She was awak-
</p>
<p>ened from her lethargy by the voice of Stella
</p>
<p>calling piteously from above.
</p>
<p>" Oh ! Aunt Comfort ! Do come here ! Do
</p>
<p>come here ! "
</p>
<p>And as the only remaining personage in the field
</p>
<p>of his vision disappeared, John Lamm, detective,
</p>
<p>began to exhibit sundry signs of exasperation. In
</p>
<p>vain he strained his listening ears, in vain he ven-
</p>
<p>tured to raise the sash of the window to an impru-

</p>
<p>dent degree. Nothing but the vague murmur of
</p>
<p>64 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>voices and the occasional distant sound of sobbing
</p>
<p>rewarded his efforts.
</p>
<p>" To be cut off at such a point as this! " he fumed.
</p>
<p>" I'd enjoy hanging the architect who put such a
</p>
<p>stupid building together ! "
</p>
<p>There was nothing for him to do but to con-
</p>
<p>jecture and wait. The two people remained in the
</p>
<p>parlor for nearly half an hour. At the expiration
</p>
<p>of that time the impatient watcher saw the portiere
</p>
<p>disturbed and they reappeared in the hall. Mr.
</p>
<p>Lamm eagerly marked their respective appearances,
</p>
<p>hoping thereby to construct some theory of the
</p>
<p>nature of their interview. Marion was very pale,
</p>
<p>cold, determined, collected. Fetridge bore traces
</p>
<p>of unwonted agitation. His face was flushed ; his
</p>
<p>hand unsteady.
</p>
<p>She accompanied him to the door. He had
</p>
<p>opened it, when he turned impulsively and said,
</p>
<p>appealingly :
</p>
<p>" Marion, wont you reconsider your unhappy
</p>
<p>resolution and make a confidant of me ? "
</p>
<p>" Richard Fetridge, you ought to understand me
</p>
<p>well enough by this time to know that I never go
</p>
<p>any other way than straight ahead. I do not act
</p>
<p>on impulse, but from determination."
</p>
<p>He seemed abashed for some reason. His eyes
</p>
<p>were turned towards the floor at her feet.
</p>
<p>" It was only for your good," he murmured.
</p>
<p>" And I shall still continue to do everything in my
</p>
<p>power to make the terrible blow easier for you."

</p>
<p>He bowed constrainedly, glanced furtively up the
</p>
<p>AND WHO IS THE AFORESAID MARIE? 65
</p>
<p>staircase as if he hoped to see another face, and
</p>
<p>went out. The door closed.
</p>
<p>Marion caught her breath, set her teeth together,
</p>
<p>clinched her fists, and stood motionless looking at
</p>
<p>the carpet.
</p>
<p>" I'd give five hundred dollars to know what that
</p>
<p>girl is thinking of," thought the detective ; " she
</p>
<p>can assume the most unpleasant expression for a
</p>
<p>handsome woman I ever saw. And, hang me, if I
</p>
<p>shouldn't dislike to be in a position dependent on
</p>
<p>her and incur her enmity. She would sting like a
</p>
<p>serpent the man who attempted to throttle her."
</p>
<p>The fair woman with the Medea face did not
</p>
<p>remain long the subject of his critical contempla-
</p>
<p>tion. Slowly, and in the same thoughtful attitude,
</p>
<p>she began with firm step to ascend the staircase,
</p>
<p>and soon vanished from John Lamm's sight and
</p>
<p>hearing.
</p>
<p>That gentleman rapidly came to the conclusion
</p>
<p>that there was nothing further to be gained by
</p>
<p>longer remaining in his precarious hiding-place.
</p>
<p>Carefully closing the window, he turned the key in
</p>
<p>the lock, and was preparing to leave by way of the
</p>
<p>door, when he stopped suddenly under the spell of
</p>
<p>a new idea. He remained inactive just long enough
</p>
<p>to consider the feasibility of the proposition. It
</p>
<p>was a bold step to take, but bold steps, to the verge
</p>
<p>of recklessness sometimes, were those by which he
</p>
<p>had achieved his present eminence in his profession.
</p>
<p>In two minutes his mind was made up. Instead

</p>
<p>of leaving by the door, he first made sure that the
</p>
<p>66 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>coast was clear, and then got out of the window,
</p>
<p>and walked rapidly around the corner to the front
</p>
<p>entrance.
</p>
<p>He pulled authoritatively at the bell. After a
</p>
<p>short delay the summons was answered by the still
</p>
<p>tremulous Moffett.
</p>
<p>" I am sorry, man," said Mr. Lamm, " but I
</p>
<p>must see the ladies after all. Give my card to
</p>
<p>Miss Harwood, please."
</p>
<p>Moffett accepted the proffered piece of paste-
</p>
<p>board, on which was engraved :
</p>
<p>DlLLINGHAM.
</p>
<p>Police Detective.
</p>
<p>Aunt Comfort responded, breathless and asth-
</p>
<p>matic. She invited John Lamm into the recep-
</p>
<p>tion-room. With quiet dignity the detective pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to apologize and to reassure her. He
</p>
<p>regretted the necessity which forced him to call at
</p>
<p>such a time, and enlarged upon the great service
</p>
<p>she might do the cause of justice by making him
</p>
<p>acquainted with whatsoever facts of any possible
</p>
<p>bearing on the motive for the murder that might
</p>
<p>be in her possession. It was useless. At another
</p>
<p>time the amiable housekeeper might have filled his
</p>
<p>note-book with unconscious revelations ; but there
</p>
<p>is a point beyond which garrulousness becomes
</p>
<p>complete idiocy, and it is little exaggeration to say

</p>
<p>that the terrible events of the day had carried
</p>
<p>AND WHO IS THE AFORESAID MARIE? 67
</p>
<p>Aunt Comfort over the limit. There was abso-
</p>
<p>lutely nothing to be got from her but tears and
</p>
<p>gasps and interjections. The idea of calling upon
</p>
<p>Mrs. Stackhouse to present the case was an inspir-
</p>
<p>ation to her and a relief to the patient Lamm.
</p>
<p>It is true that he awaited the coming of Marion
</p>
<p>with some compunctions and no little curiosity.
</p>
<p>The young lady entered the room haughtily, and
</p>
<p>looked at him in a distant, unemotional way.
</p>
<p>" Did you desire my presence, sir?"
</p>
<p>" If you please, madam," said John Lamm ;
</p>
<p>"and also that of your sister, if it be possible."
</p>
<p>"My sister," she returned quickly, "is alto-
</p>
<p>gether too young to be of any use to you in such
</p>
<p>an emergency. Nor do I choose to have her dis-
</p>
<p>turbed at such a time."
</p>
<p>" I bow to your superior judgment, madam.
</p>
<p>You understand that I am a simple officer of the
</p>
<p>law with the single purpose of doing my duty. I
</p>
<p>wish to do it with as little anoyance to the family
</p>
<p>as possible."
</p>
<p>" What do you wish, sir ? I do not see how any-
</p>
<p>body in this house can aid you. We know noth-
</p>
<p>ing of this crime but the awful fact, and it does
</p>
<p>seem that at such a time the police might do their
</p>
<p>duty without intruding into the circle of the
</p>
<p>bereaved family."
</p>
<p>" Pardon me," said Lamm, humbly but respect-
</p>
<p>fully, as he stood before her, turning his hat in his
</p>
<p>uneasy hands. " The affair is a mystery. We

<p>desire to arrest the guilty parties. Often the rela-
</p>
<p>68 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>lives in such cases have strong reasons for suspi-
</p>
<p>cions."
</p>
<p>" We have none," returned Marion decisively.
</p>
<p>" No, indeed ! " corroborated Aunt Comfort.
</p>
<p>" The idea of such a thing ! "
</p>
<p>" You are utterly unaware of any possible motive
</p>
<p>for this crime ? "
</p>
<p>Intentionally Detective Lamm cast a keen, search-
</p>
<p>ing glance full into the face of the stoical young
</p>
<p>woman. His idea was to intimidate rather than to
</p>
<p>observe her, for he had a furtive way of scrutiniz-
</p>
<p>ing people without appearing to do so. It was in-
</p>
<p>effective. Not even her eyelashes quivered.
</p>
<p>" Utterly," she said firmly. " And now, sir, are
</p>
<p>you satisfied ? "
</p>
<p>" Unfortunately, no," said Lamm, glancing un-
</p>
<p>easily at Aunt Comfort. " Could I would it be
</p>
<p>presumptuous in me to ask for a private inter-
</p>
<p>view ?"
</p>
<p>Marion drew a full breath. There was a slight
</p>
<p>quiver as she did so, which seemed to indicate that
</p>
<p>her calmness was the result of rigid expressions of
</p>
<p>her spontaneous emotions. She motioned Aunt
</p>
<p>Comfort towards the hall.
</p>
<p>" Well, sir ? " she said as soon as they were alone.
</p>
<p>John Lamm saw that she had no intention of pro-
</p>
<p>longing the interview. He resolved to break the
</p>
<p>ice of her reserve with one fell crush.
</p>
<p>" Tell me," he said, without preface, " who is
</p>
<p>Marie Moyso ? "

<p>She could not repress the start nor the tell-tale

</p>
<p>blush that rose into her cheeks. But she made a
</p>
<p>brave effort which aroused John Lamm's unspoken
</p>
<p>admiration.
</p>
<p>" Why do you ask ? " Only this in a faint voice,
</p>
<p>as a response to this unexpected bombshell.
</p>
<p>" What grit that girl has ! " was John Lamm's
</p>
<p>unuttered comment. Her question, however,
</p>
<p>warned him that he was on the brink of a precipice,
</p>
<p>the other side of which he could not see. Still,
</p>
<p>with his accustomed audacity, he took the leap in
</p>
<p>the dark.
</p>
<p>" Because," he said boldly, " there is reason to
</p>
<p>believe that such a woman is mixed up in this
</p>
<p>affair."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! " she returned coldly, "I know nothing of
</p>
<p>her. Really, Mr. Officer, you must excuse me if
</p>
<p>you have nothing more to say than this. The
</p>
<p>occasion is too grave too solemn. You should go
</p>
<p>to Mr. North's partner, Mr. Stackhouse. He can
</p>
<p>tell you more about it than anybody else."
</p>
<p>Did she mean to give these last words a special
</p>
<p>emphasis ? The detective was not sure, but he
</p>
<p>saw that it would be more than useless to prolong
</p>
<p>the interview. He had made up his mind that
</p>
<p>Marion Stackhouse was impervious to surprise and
</p>
<p>inaccessible to an ordinary appeal. Before he
</p>
<p>could hope to penetrate that armor he would be
</p>
<p>obliged to prepare himself with a host of facts of
</p>
<p>which he was now ignorant. So he took his leave
</p>
<p>with the best grace possible, and once more breathed

</p>
<p>it was a relief to get out of that house with its mys-
</p>
<p>terious secrets and its unlaid ghosts.
</p>
<p>" She is one woman in ten thousand ! " he mut-
</p>
<p>tered to himself as he walked away. " At her age
</p>
<p>such self-command is as uncommon as a lottery
</p>
<p>prize. Well, we'll try again."
</p>
<p>Some inquiries assured him that it was not far to
</p>
<p>the seaside residence of Richard Fetridge. In five
</p>
<p>minutes after leaving Marion's presence he was
</p>
<p>bowing before the astonished Fetridge, whom he
</p>
<p>met on the veranda overlooking the ocean.
</p>
<p>" You here ? "
</p>
<p>" So it would seem, Mr. Fetridge."
</p>
<p>" And what can you have discovered so
</p>
<p>soon ? "
</p>
<p>" I'll tell you. It is a simple clue and may not
</p>
<p>lead to much. Still I must beg leave to ask your
</p>
<p>assistance. I wish to put a question, stipulating
</p>
<p>that you do not ask me any in return. You see, I
</p>
<p>am not ready to make a report yet."
</p>
<p>Fetridge slightly frowned. Evidently he did not
</p>
<p>relish mysteries.
</p>
<p>" Ask your question, Mr. Lamm."
</p>
<p>" Who is Marie Moyso ? "
</p>
<p>Fetridge sprang up with a force that overturned
</p>
<p>his chair.
</p>
<p>" The deuce ! " he ejaculated. " How came you
</p>
<p>by that name ? "
</p>
<p>" Ho, ho ! " quoth John Lamm in his mind.
</p>
<p>" This gentleman does not guard his secrets so well

</p>
<p>" I must remind you. Mr. Fetridge," he returned,
</p>
<p>quietly, " that you were not to ask questions. Still,
</p>
<p>I don't mind telling you that the woman seems to
</p>
<p>be in some way connected with our friend Stack-
</p>
<p>house."
</p>
<p>" Humph ! I shall begin to regard you as a wizard,
</p>
<p>rather than a detective, Mr. Lamm," Fetridge re-
</p>
<p>marked, with an effort to conceal his astonishment.
</p>
<p>" I must say I cannot conceive by what possibility
</p>
<p>you become possessed of that name. But since
</p>
<p>you have, I must remind you that you are working
</p>
<p>for me, and that whatever information you obtain
</p>
<p>ends with me. Nobody beyond us is to know a
</p>
<p>syllable. You understand that ? "
</p>
<p>" I should be wholly ignorant of my business if
</p>
<p>I did not."
</p>
<p>" Very well. But about this Moissot woman "
</p>
<p>" And, by the way, how do you spell that, Mr.
</p>
<p>Fetridge ? "
</p>
<p>Fetridge spelled the name and Mr. Lamm wrote
</p>
<p>it down, smiling at his own mistake.
</p>
<p>" French?"
</p>
<p>" It's a Creole name, I believe."
</p>
<p>" Oh, to be sure. And have you any idea of her
</p>
<p>whereabouts at this time ? "
</p>
<p>" She was in New York five years ago. I cannot
</p>
<p>say though Mr. Stackhouse, who may find it con-
</p>
<p>venient to keep track of her, perhaps can what
</p>
<p>has become of her."
</p>
<p>The two men looked at each other.

<p>Not caring to betray himself by answering this

<p>question, John Lamm deemed it prudent to with-

<p>draw.
</p>
<p>" I have barely time to catch the train back," he
</p>
<p>exclaimed, hurriedly glancing at his watch in the

</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI.
</p>
<p>LIFE AFTER DEATH.
</p>
<p>AT eight o'clock in the evening of this same Fri-
</p>
<p>day, medical examiner Jarrett sat at his desk
</p>
<p>in the office at his house busily writing.
</p>
<p>" Upon making a careful and complete examina-
</p>
<p>tion of the body of the man named Paul North, I
</p>
<p>find that a ball, probably fired from a revolver of
</p>
<p>32 calibre, at an angle of probably 20 degrees, and
</p>
<p>from a distance not exceeding three feet, entered
</p>
<p>his back near the spinal column at the seventh inter-
</p>
<p>costal space on the right side, and passed in an
</p>
<p>inward and upward direction, going through the
</p>
<p>upper portion of the liver and completely through
</p>
<p>the lower lobe of the right lung.
</p>
<p>" The path of the ball was not arrested, showing
</p>
<p>that it was fired in the direction indicated. It
</p>
<p>pierced the lung nearly opposite the third rib and
</p>
<p>left the body on the front side, just above the rib
</p>
<p>named.
</p>
<p>" I do not find that the said Paul North could
</p>
<p>have committed suicide. The position of the
</p>
<p>entrance of the ball, and its direction, seemed to
</p>
<p>deny this possibility.
</p>
<p>" There was ample external haemorrhage to have

<p>74 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>permitted the man to have written the words on
</p>
<p>the wall of the room in which he was found. If so,
</p>
<p>immediately the writing was concluded, he no doubt
</p>
<p>died.
</p>
<p>" Death was painless, and resulted from internal
</p>
<p>haemorrhage, caused by the opening of an artery in
</p>
<p>the right lung."
</p>
<p>The ringing of the office bell suspended the report
</p>
<p>of the autopsy over Paul North's body at this point.
</p>
<p>Dr, Jarrett rose to meet his caller, recognizing
</p>
<p>him at once as the reporter whom he had met a few
</p>
<p>hours previously at the house in Marlboro Street.
</p>
<p>"Ah, Thomas," he said, " still on the case, eh?
</p>
<p>A very good story, that of yours in the afternoon
</p>
<p>paper very judicious indeed."
</p>
<p>" Thanks," the reporter answered. "And now I
</p>
<p>want you to help me get out an equally good story,
</p>
<p>or a better one, for the morning. The autopsy
</p>
<p>was performed at the City Hospital morgue, of
</p>
<p>course. Can't you give me the report ? "
</p>
<p>Dr. Jarrett shook his head and rubbed his chin.
</p>
<p>" There isn't a man I would sooner give out the
</p>
<p>report to than you, Thomas, but it wouldn't do to
</p>
<p>have it published before it's submitted. All I can
</p>
<p>say at this point really is that I have no doubt
</p>
<p>whatever that murder has been committed."
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas fingered his watch chain.
</p>
<p>" Not a word more ? " he queried.
</p>
<p>" I'll tell you what I'll do, Thomas," the medical
</p>
<p>examiner answered, after a meditative turn up and

<p>down the hall. " You have kept a good many im-
</p>
<p>LIFE AFTER DEATH. 75
</p>
<p>portant secrets when the work of the authorities
</p>
<p>couldn't have been done without your silence. I'll
</p>
<p>tell you who assisted in the autopsy. You could
</p>
<p>interview him without mentioning my name in the
</p>
<p>matter."
</p>
<p>A broad smile illumined the reporter's face, and
</p>
<p>he presented the medical examiner with a very
</p>
<p>comprehensive wink.
</p>
<p>" Dr. Francis Huntress is the man," continued
</p>
<p>the examiner, confidentially. " He has an office
</p>
<p>where he lives, at No. Greenwich Park."
</p>
<p>" I know him well," said Mr. Thomas, as he
</p>
<p>parted from the doctor ; and there was full justifi-
</p>
<p>cation for the words in the friendly greeting
</p>
<p>accorded to him at the surgeon's door.
</p>
<p>Two minutes after he had pulled at the bell
</p>
<p>handle, Thomas was comfortably ensconced in an
</p>
<p>easy-chair in the doctor's study, the physician sit-
</p>
<p>ting opposite to him at his desk, where a drop light
</p>
<p>burned.
</p>
<p>"You are the most extraordinary fellow," the
</p>
<p>surgeon exclaimed, admiringly, after Thomas had
</p>
<p>stated his mission. " Some of the morgue people
</p>
<p>must have told you I was called in. No ? Well,
</p>
<p>never mind we'll assume you divined it, as you
</p>
<p>have a hundred other matters supposed to be the
</p>
<p>most profound of secrets. But I'll tell you one
</p>
<p>one thing, my black-haired friend. This is one of
</p>
<p>the most curious and remarkable cases that ever
</p>
<p>came to my attention ! "

</p>
<p>" You have no doubt it was a case of murder ? "
</p>
<p>7 6 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>questioned Mr. Thomas, busy with his watch
</p>
<p>charm.
</p>
<p>"I can find no other explanation. You saw the
</p>
<p>wound ; you noticed how the man lay ? Now the
</p>
<p>bullet was a 32-calibre pistol ball. It entered at
</p>
<p>an angle of certainly no less than twenty degrees,
</p>
<p>and went upwards and inwards in that direction.
</p>
<p>I don't know whether you observed any traces of
</p>
<p>powder on the man's clothing ? "
</p>
<p>"No."
</p>
<p>" They were there, nevertheless. And that means
</p>
<p>that the pistol from which the fatal shot was fired
</p>
<p>couldn't have been held more than three feet away.
</p>
<p>At the same time we concluded it must have been
</p>
<p>more than two. And this, you see, effectually dis-
</p>
<p>poses of the theory of suicide."
</p>
<p>" An angle of twenty degrees, you say, doctor ? "
</p>
<p>" About that not exactly."
</p>
<p>" Then the pistol was fired behind the man's
</p>
<p>back ; and was held at what height from the
</p>
<p>floor ? "
</p>
<p>" Very easily reckoned. About two and a half
</p>
<p>feet from the floor."
</p>
<p>" That's curious," said Thomas, with a puzzled
</p>
<p>air ; " but the angle of twenty degrees explains
</p>
<p>what I couldn't understand. And that is why the
</p>
<p>bullet should have entered the wall at a height of
</p>
<p>ten feet from the floor."
</p>
<p>''Indeed ! " exclaimed the surgeon, greatly inter-
</p>
<p>ested ; " well, now, if you've got the lateral angle

</p>
<p>of that bullet, since we already have the upward
</p>
<p>LIFE AFTER DEATH. 77
</p>
<p>angle of it, it is a simple mathematical problem to
</p>
<p>decide just where Paul North stood when the shot
</p>
<p>was fired."
</p>
<p>Thomas drew a roll of paper from his pocket.
</p>
<p>Separating from a curled-up photographer's proof
</p>
<p>the proof of a compositor, he spread it out upon
</p>
<p>the surgeon's desk. It was his diagram of the sec-
</p>
<p>ond floor of the house in Marlboro Street.
</p>
<p>" There, doctor," he said, pointing with his pen-
</p>
<p>cil to the center of the space between the two
</p>
<p>doors at the back of the library ; " that is about
</p>
<p>the point where the bullet entered. The cartridge
</p>
<p>end of the ball was intact, and protruded from the
</p>
<p>wall, pointing like the end of a finger backwards
</p>
<p>and downwards in a direction that would bring us
</p>
<p>very near the writing desk in the corner by the
</p>
<p>bay-window."
</p>
<p>" How far distant ? "
</p>
<p>" I should say about fifteen feet."
</p>
<p>The surgeon made a brief mathematical calcula-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>" Roughly speaking," he said, " there is a rise of
</p>
<p>about six inches to a foot in an angle of twenty
</p>
<p>degrees. Starting with a point two and a half feet
</p>
<p>from the floor the remaining seven feet and a half
</p>
<p>necessary to attain the height of ten feet would be
</p>
<p>gained in a horizontal measurement of just about
</p>
<p>fifteen feet."
</p>
<p>" Capital ! " exclaimed Thomas, who saw the
</p>
<p>force of this at once. " It follows inevitably that

</p>
<p>the murderer must have fired from a point near the
</p>
<p>78 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>writing-desk, and that North stood three or four
</p>
<p>feet this side of the desk, facing the wall."
</p>
<p>" Or better still, facing the door near where he
</p>
<p>was found."
</p>
<p>" Just as if," said the reporter, " somebody there
</p>
<p>had called to him or startled him so that he turned
</p>
<p>away from his assailant for the moment."
</p>
<p>" And the murderer had been sitting before the
</p>
<p>writing-desk. Exactly."
</p>
<p>Thomas shook his head dubiously.
</p>
<p>" All this sounds very well, doctor," he said ;
</p>
<p>" but it's too mathematical to be true. Things
</p>
<p>don't happen that way. The bullet may have been
</p>
<p>deflected in its course."
</p>
<p>" I don't see how it could have been."
</p>
<p>" Oh, gracious ! don't attempt to account for
</p>
<p>the conduct of bullets," said Thomas ; " the police
</p>
<p>departments are full of the most curious records of
</p>
<p>their freaks. Sometimes the most deadly ball will
</p>
<p>fail to do its work especially if held too near the
</p>
<p>victim. One man, it is said, attempted to commit
</p>
<p>suicide by holding the pistol muzzle against his
</p>
<p>forehead. If he had held it a little way off it
</p>
<p>would have blown his brains out. As it was, the
</p>
<p>bullet flattened itself and slid off harmlessly. And
</p>
<p>as an instance of the power of a spent ball, I may
</p>
<p>cite the case of that East Boston woman a short
</p>
<p>time ago, who was killed while frying doughnuts at
</p>
<p>her kitchen stove, by a bullet fired by a guard on
</p>
<p>duty at the Navy Yard a mile away. To enter the

<p>house the bullet bored its way through the whole
</p>
<p>LIFE AFTER DEATH. 79
</p>
<p>thickness of the window-sash and went clean
</p>
<p>through her besides."
</p>
<p>" So you would consider it nothing astonishing
</p>
<p>that the bullet in this case, after passing completely
</p>
<p>through North's body, should still have the strength
</p>
<p>to bury itself in the wall."
</p>
<p>" No," said Thomas ; " though I should say
</p>
<p>unhesitatingly that it was no toy pistol. And now,
</p>
<p>doctor, I want to ask you two or three questions.
</p>
<p>In the first place, isn't it within the possibilities of
</p>
<p>medical science to determine just how long a man
</p>
<p>has been dead ?"
</p>
<p>" Anywhere within twenty-four or thirty-six
</p>
<p>hours, probably yes."
</p>
<p>" With how much accuracy ? "
</p>
<p>" Well, possibly within an hour."
</p>
<p>" As close as that ? "
</p>
<p>" I believe that most surgeons and physicians
</p>
<p>accept the proposition of an eminent surgeon and
</p>
<p>chemist who stated a few years ago tha". the day
</p>
<p>will come when we may first determine the general
</p>
<p>health of the subject by examination of the other
</p>
<p>organs, and then submit the clotted blood in the
</p>
<p>heart to microscopic tests. The blood, you know,
</p>
<p>is made up of three parts the serum, and the red
</p>
<p>and white corpuscles. The red corpuscles contain
</p>
<p>the life. That life remains for several days after
</p>
<p>death if the body is without disease to induce over-
</p>
<p>rapid decomposition. The length of time which

</p>
<p>" Have those tests been applied in this case,
</p>
<p>doctor ? "
</p>
<p>" Yes ; but merely as an experiment to compare
</p>
<p>with the other tests applied. I am happy to say
</p>
<p>they showed, in a measure, the probable reliability
</p>
<p>of the theory."
</p>
<p>" And what were those other tests ?"
</p>
<p>" Most bodies become quite cold in from eight
</p>
<p>to twelve hours after death. In the cases of bodies
</p>
<p>which present certain signs that I need not detail,
</p>
<p>we know that death has not been present more than
</p>
<p>twelve hours. In from twelve to eighteen hours,
</p>
<p>however, the eyeballs become soft and inelastic and
</p>
<p>feel flaccid. The last sign of the earliest stage of
</p>
<p>death is the rigor mortis. This is, perhaps, the
</p>
<p>most dependable of the signs we have to guide us
</p>
<p>at present. Of course, the rigidity of the body
</p>
<p>may continue beyond a week, but the circumstances
</p>
<p>which would occasion this would be too extra-
</p>
<p>ordinary to be unnoticed. Considering all these
</p>
<p>things, I should repeat that the length of time which
</p>
<p>Mr. North has been dead is tolerably certain."
</p>
<p>" And from this, when did you determine that
</p>
<p>Mr. North had died ? "
</p>
<p>" Perhaps Dr. Jarrett would object to my giving
</p>
<p>that information to the press," said the surgeon,
</p>
<p>hesitatingly.
</p>
<p>" Then don't give it to the press. Give it to me."

</p>
<p>" And you what will you do with it ?"
</p>
<p>" Compare it with such other information as I
</p>
<p>already possess, to see if my suspicions are correct."
</p>
<p>" You suspect somebody."
</p>
<p>" Everybody."
</p>
<p>The surgeon laughed, and Thomas laughed with
</p>
<p>him. There was a quiet air of unassuming ability
</p>
<p>and a strength of character about the newspaper
</p>
<p>man which asserted itself to everybody of sufficient
</p>
<p>discernment to appreciate such a fact before he
</p>
<p>had been in their presence five minutes. The sur-
</p>
<p>geon, moreover, knew him to be a man of his
</p>
<p>word.
</p>
<p>"Then I understand that this communication is
</p>
<p>confidential?" he asked.
</p>
<p>" Decidedly, for the present."
</p>
<p>" In that case, I don't mind telling you that we
</p>
<p>came to the conclusion that Mr. North was shot
</p>
<p>between eight and nine o'clock last night."
</p>
<p>The reporter repeated the sentence word for
</p>
<p>word to be sure there was no mistake, and rolled
</p>
<p>the pendant to his watch chain rapidly between his
</p>
<p>fingers.
</p>
<p>"What is it?" asked the surgeon, whose atten-
</p>
<p>tion was directed towards the glistening white
</p>
<p>trifle.
</p>
<p>" That ? " said the reporter, glancing down and
</p>
<p>up again with a quaint smile. " That's a souvenir
</p>
<p>of a case I worked on once. It was a woman's tooth,
</p>
<p>I suspect, at one time. It was a sort of a clue

</p>
<p>it don't matter. It's an interesting story, so I wont
</p>
<p>get started on it. I'm not so sure the North case
</p>
<p>wont equal it. Of course, you know about that
</p>
<p>strange writing on the wall ? "
</p>
<p>" Yes," was the answer ; " Dr. Jarrett said there
</p>
<p>was no doubt that a name was scrawled there, and
</p>
<p>that the writing was in blood."
</p>
<p>" Do you think Mr. North could have written it
</p>
<p>himself ? "
</p>
<p>" Well, that's a leading question," answered the
</p>
<p>surgeon, as he leaned back in his chair. " I did
</p>
<p>not see the writing."
</p>
<p>" No ? " said Thomas. He unrolled the photog-
</p>
<p>rapher's proof. " Well, there it is natural size,
</p>
<p>just as it looks."
</p>
<p>The surgeon scrutinized the scrawl with great
</p>
<p>interest.
</p>
<p>"Well, this is most extraordinary," he said.
</p>
<p>" Why, you can plainly mark how many times he
</p>
<p>was obliged to dip his finger by the corresponding
</p>
<p>heaviness of outline. Observe the S, the a, the h,
</p>
<p>and finally the letter following the u, where his
</p>
<p>strength seems suddenly to have deserted him and
</p>
<p>the finger dragged downwards. That makes four
</p>
<p>times."
</p>
<p>" Yes, if he wrote it," said Thomas. " But how
</p>
<p>about that, doctor ? "
</p>
<p>" There is, at least, no conclusive reason why he
</p>
<p>might not have written it himself. It was certainly
</p>
<p>done with his forefinger. A careful examination of

</p>
<p>the end of that finger convinces me that it had not
</p>
<p>LIFE AFTER DEATH. 83
</p>
<p>only been dipped in blood, but thereafter drawn
</p>
<p>over a surface while wet. The difference in the
</p>
<p>degree of the stain at different parts of the finger
</p>
<p>indicates that. How far above the floor is this
</p>
<p>writing? "
</p>
<p>" Just about a foot and a half. It is a tinted
</p>
<p>wall, and the writing is immediately above the foot-
</p>
<p>board."
</p>
<p>In his interest the surgeon actually left his chair
</p>
<p>and got down upon his side by his study wall, and,
</p>
<p>raising himself slightly on his right elbow, began to
</p>
<p>trace with the forefinger of his right hand.
</p>
<p>" Just the right height," he said. " Was the
</p>
<p>writing horizontal ? Did it run just parallel with
</p>
<p>the footboard ?"
</p>
<p>"Just about."
</p>
<p>" If a man had directed this writing from a
</p>
<p>higher point, Thomas, he would have written back
</p>
<p>handed. How was the slope of the letters ? "
</p>
<p>" Natural."
</p>
<p>" And have you seen any specimens of North's
</p>
<p>handwriting ? Does he form his letters that way ? "
</p>
<p>" Yes ; as nearly as could be expected under the
</p>
<p>circumstances."
</p>
<p>" Then I should say," said the surgeon, rising,
</p>
<p>" that it is more than probable that North wrote it."
</p>
<p>" But with a wound like that," suggested the
</p>
<p>reporter, " death must have been instantaneous."
</p>
<p>" Ah, there you have failed to distinguish between
</p>
<p>speedy death and instantaneous death. What is

</p>
<p>in the heart, for instance is by no means such. A
</p>
<p>second is an hour to a dying man. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, the severing of the spinal column by a bullet
</p>
<p>would actually cut a thought in two. Man goes
</p>
<p>into the presence of his Maker under such circum-
</p>
<p>stances without an instant to prepare himself. But
</p>
<p>in a case like North's, we must take into con-
</p>
<p>sideration the power of the human will to prolong
</p>
<p>life."
</p>
<p>" To defer the moment of death ? " asked the
</p>
<p>reporter, incredulously.
</p>
<p>" Certainly. A man shot through the heart often
</p>
<p>has time to cry out a sentence. The incredible
</p>
<p>swiftness of thought in the hour of mortal peril has
</p>
<p>been attested by the mouths of hundreds of
</p>
<p>witnesses. Rescued from impending death by some
</p>
<p>providential good fortune, they have declared that
</p>
<p>they lived over the events of a lifetime in a few
</p>
<p>seconds."
</p>
<p>" But this writing on the wall was not an act of
</p>
<p>memory."
</p>
<p>" No. But with thought in a man of strong
</p>
<p>purpose would come quick determination and the
</p>
<p>power to act, even at that moment. You must bear
</p>
<p>in mind that Mr. North's death was caused by the
</p>
<p>filling of his lungs with blood instead of air. It
</p>
<p>was a painless death, and Mr. North's will power
</p>
<p>would have enabled him to prolong his life sixty
</p>
<p>seconds perhaps even 180 seconds ample time

</p>
<p>as if you had to dip your finger in the writing fluid
</p>
<p>four times. There. Now time yourself. How
</p>
<p>long did it take you?"
</p>
<p>"Just twenty seconds," said Mr. Thomas.
</p>
<p>" Exactly. Now you understand the possibilities
</p>
<p>in this matter of the writing; and I tell you, Thomas,
</p>
<p>this talk with you only confirms and emphasizes my
</p>
<p>belief that here you have a great case one of the
</p>
<p>most extraordinary in my experience. If you can
</p>
<p>put what I've told you to good use, I shall be glad;
</p>
<p>but mind, I shall not look to see it in the morning
</p>
<p>papers."
</p>
<p>The surgeon had arisen and was accompanying
</p>
<p>the reporter to the door. Thomas stopped him by
</p>
<p>a restraining gesture.
</p>
<p>" By the way, doctor, stand just as you are. Now
</p>
<p>will you put your finger on that part of your body
</p>
<p>corresponding to that where Paul North was shot ? "
</p>
<p>The surgeon obliged him. Thomas, standing
</p>
<p>behind him, made several rapid measurements and
</p>
<p>calculations with his eye and hand.
</p>
<p>" There is something decidedly curious here,
</p>
<p>doctor," he said. '' Stand behind me, please. Sup-
</p>
<p>pose me your intended victim, if it's not too great a
</p>
<p>strain on your imagination. Now see where you
</p>
<p>must hold your pistol to comply with all conditions
</p>
<p>within three feet, pointed upward at an angle of
</p>
<p>twenty degrees ! "
</p>
<p>The surgeon, who hastened to attempt the
</p>
<p>experiment, uttered an exclamation of surprise.

<p>" Curious how much a man may miss when he
</p>
<p>86 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>thinks he has observed the whole, sometimes," he
</p>
<p>said. " Why, I never thought of this before."
</p>
<p>" What, doctor ? "
</p>
<p>" The man who fired that ball must have been
</p>
<p>upon his knees."
</p>
<p>" Precisely ! Precisely ! " exclaimed Thomas.
</p>
<p>" Just my thoughts exactly. What sane person
</p>
<p>would fire a pistol at a man in any such direction
</p>
<p>in an erect attitude ? It would be almost equally
</p>
<p>absurd if the assassin had been seated."
</p>
<p>" You are right," returned the surgeon, thought-
</p>
<p>fully. " He might have been crouching behind
</p>
<p>some article of furniture "
</p>
<p>" Or been previously knocked down ! " Thomas
</p>
<p>interposed, turning a very meaning look upon the
</p>
<p>surgeon's face.
</p>
<p>" So, indeed ! That would indicate, then, a
</p>
<p>struggle to your mind ! "
</p>
<p>" It would indicate that the murderer fired in
</p>
<p>self-defense, or from momentary passion induced
</p>
<p>by North's treatment of him."
</p>
<p>"Good! Good !" cried the surgeon. "There's
</p>
<p>a theory that presents all the plausibility of life.
</p>
<p>These cold-blooded, deliberate murders are going
</p>
<p>out of fashion in this age of the world. And there-
</p>
<p>upon the horrified murderer flees and the dying
</p>
<p>man writes his name upon the wall by which he
</p>
<p>lies."
</p>
<p>Thomas shook hands warmly with the speaker.
</p>
<p>He did not say so, but the surgeon understood

</p>
<p>gratulating him upon having arrived at the same
</p>
<p>conclusions to which he himself had come.
</p>
<p>When Thomas found himself in the cool air of
</p>
<p>the June night again, he hastened at a round pace
</p>
<p>in the direction of Newspaper Row. He was near
</p>
<p>the door of his own office when a man jumped from
</p>
<p>a horse car and tapped him upon the shoulder. It
</p>
<p>was Detective John Lamm, direct from Swamp-
</p>
<p>scott.
</p>
<p>"What's your hurry, Kingman ? " he inquired,
</p>
<p>with the easy assurance of a familiar acquaintance.
</p>
<p>"Come up into my office a few minutes. I want
</p>
<p>to talk with you."
</p>
<p>Reporter Thomas consulted his watch.
</p>
<p>" The fact is, old man," he said with a frank
</p>
<p>smile, " I'm rather driven to-night. It's that North
</p>
<p>mystery, you understand."
</p>
<p>" How do you know that isn't the very matter I
</p>
<p>wanted to talk with you about ? " returned Mr.
</p>
<p>Lamm, taking the reporter's arm with good-humored
</p>
<p>insistence, and escorting him, half reluctantly, to
</p>
<p>his own private den, as he called it.
</p>
<p>" Kingman, I know you, and you know me," said
</p>
<p>the detective, after they were fairly settled in their
</p>
<p>chairs. " It came to me when I saw you just now
</p>
<p>that we might work this case together. It wouldn't
</p>
<p>be the first case we have handled together, eh ? "
</p>
<p>" You're right," said Thomas.
</p>
<p>" Now, I'm interested in this North mystery very
</p>
<p>particularly, you understand," pursued Mr. Lamm,

</p>
<p>quite warming to his subject, now that he was
</p>
<p>88 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>closeted with a tried friend, and at an hour when
</p>
<p>he was reasonably secure from interruption. "Not
</p>
<p>for the Government, of course. Private parties.
</p>
<p>And my opinion, gathered from all I have been
</p>
<p>able to ascertain about the case, is that it is very
</p>
<p>mysterious, very complicated, and may baffle even
</p>
<p>the most thorough investigation."
</p>
<p>Thomas pursed up his lips, and regarded the gas
</p>
<p>jet doubtfully.
</p>
<p>"You don't think so, eh ? "
</p>
<p>' When I hear what Thornton Stackhouse's
</p>
<p>alibi is, I can answer you better."
</p>
<p>"Alibi, eh ? So you have the medical examiner's
</p>
<p>report ? Good ! Just what I was after. When
</p>
<p>did North die ? "
</p>
<p>The reporter laughingly parried this query with
</p>
<p>another.
</p>
<p>" Do you suppose I have the doctor's report on
</p>
<p>the autopsy in my coat pocket ? "
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm ventured to express a shrewd suspic-
</p>
<p>ion that his friend did possess, by some fortunate
</p>
<p>chance or other, the essential facts of that report,
</p>
<p>and Mr. Thomas quite justified that suspicion by
</p>
<p>letting him know, in strict confidence, the outcome
</p>
<p>of his interview with the surgeon.
</p>
<p>The detective uttered a long, low whistle.
</p>
<p>" Curious ! Mighty curious ! " he commented.
</p>
<p>" If you'll be so good as to give me an oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity," suggested Thomas, " I'll be pleased to
</p>
<p>ejaculate with you."

</p>
<p>" Um ha! You said a moment ago, Thomas,
</p>
<p>LIFE AFTER DEATH. 89
</p>
<p>that your opinion of the case would depend upon
</p>
<p>the alibi of Thornton Stackhouse. What would
</p>
<p>you say if I told you that the said gentleman's
</p>
<p>elsewhere has one weak spot in it, involving
</p>
<p>the precise period of time that you have
</p>
<p>mentioned ? "
</p>
<p>" I should say nothing, but remain in hourly ex-
</p>
<p>pectation of Thornton Stackhouse's arrest."
</p>
<p>"Very well. See that you do say nothing, for
</p>
<p>the secret is yours and mine at present. And so
</p>
<p>you have already convicted the poor fellow ? "
</p>
<p>John Lamm took one of the cigars which stood
</p>
<p>upright in the upper pocket of his vest, and drew a
</p>
<p>match against the under side of his chair, which
</p>
<p>was tipped back against the wall.
</p>
<p>" I must confess," Thomas replied, " that it looks
</p>
<p>to me something that way."
</p>
<p>" Oh, indeed, yes. The evidence is strong
</p>
<p>even stronger, probably, than you know against
</p>
<p>him. But then "
</p>
<p>In lieu of continuing, Lamm lighted his cigar.
</p>
<p>' Thomas, what is your definition of a good
</p>
<p>theory of a mystery ? " he suddenly inquired, as he
</p>
<p>threw the match from him.
</p>
<p>" I don't know that I ever thought of defining
</p>
<p>it."
</p>
<p>" Well, I'll tell you what mine is. A good theory
</p>
<p>is one which thoroughly explains all the facts in the
</p>
<p>case."
</p>
<p>" Short and comprehensive," said Thomas.

</p>
<p>there any fact in the case, so far known, inconsist-
</p>
<p>ent with Thornton Stackhouse being the man ? "
</p>
<p>" None at all."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! And yet I can see plainly enough that
</p>
<p>you don't subscribe to my opinion. Is there any
</p>
<p>fact which the supposition of his guilt leaves unex-
</p>
<p>plained ? "
</p>
<p>" There is one fact which the supposition of his
</p>
<p>guilt does not explain."
</p>
<p>" Well, now we are coming to the point. What
</p>
<p>is it ? "
</p>
<p>" It doesn't explain to my mind why a certain
</p>
<p>individual of my acquaintance should be so anxious
</p>
<p>to convict him."
</p>
<p>" Name the man."
</p>
<p>" It would be a breach of professional etiquette.
</p>
<p>But as you and I are old friends, Thomas, and
</p>
<p>never betray each other's confidences, I don't mind
</p>
<p>saying to you that, if you can get hold of any facts
</p>
<p>tending to explain Mr. Richard Fetridge's strong
</p>
<p>interest in this case, I shall be exceedingly obliged
</p>
<p>if you will bring them to me."
</p>
<p>" Jupiter ! " exclaimed Thomas, opening his
</p>
<p>eyes ; " there is more in this case, then, than I
</p>
<p>thought ! "
</p>
<p>And when he left the room after a half-hour's
</p>
<p>further conversation, it was with the conviction
</p>
<p>that, unless some unexpected thing happened to
</p>
<p>determine otherwise, the North mystery would turn
</p>
<p>out to be a complication worthy of his best thought

</p>
<p>THE INSPECTOR DISCOVERS NEW EVIDENCE.
</p>
<p>THE Friday when the body of Paul North was
</p>
<p>discovered, and the day following, were two
</p>
<p>exceedingly busy days for the police department,
</p>
<p>under the active superintendence and guidance of
</p>
<p>Inspector Applebee.
</p>
<p>Not even Aunt Comfort, who had made it her
</p>
<p>panting duty as housekeeper, to range the Marl-
</p>
<p>boro Street house at frequent intervals, from base-
</p>
<p>ment to attic, knew half so much about the place
</p>
<p>and what it contained as Inspector Applebee.
</p>
<p>Again and again he had examined every nook
</p>
<p>and corner, turning his bullseye upon the recesses
</p>
<p>of every trunk and box, sounding every cask and
</p>
<p>receptacle, making sure that nowhere within the
</p>
<p>four walls of Paul North's home was hidden the
</p>
<p>weapon which had caused Paul North's death.
</p>
<p>It was with rather a puzzled countenance and a
</p>
<p>mind unsettled and ill at ease that about noon on
</p>
<p>Saturday he sought a conference with his chief at
</p>
<p>headquarters ; for even Inspector Applebee had
</p>
<p>his superior officer.
</p>
<p>" Well, Applebee ! " said the chief inspector, as
</p>
<p>the door was closed, and the two men found them-

<p>selves alone in the little office ; " are you prepared
</p>
<p>to make any arrests ? What's on your mind ? Have
</p>
<p>you found out anything ? "
</p>
<p>" Found out anything ? I've found out too
</p>
<p>much. There's just the trouble. When I woke up
</p>
<p>this morning my mind was settled. Four hour's
</p>
<p>work and it's all at sea again. Fully prepared to
</p>
<p>make an arrest to-day, I've now reached a point
</p>
<p>where I don't know whom to suspect, or what to
</p>
<p>think."
</p>
<p>" Well, take this morning for a starting point.
</p>
<p>When we separated last night, you were sure the
</p>
<p>partner was our man."
</p>
<p>" I was. In the first place, North seemed to
</p>
<p>have written his name on the wall in his own blood.
</p>
<p>Now, it strikes me that an accusation made at the
</p>
<p>moment of death is a very solemn one. A man
</p>
<p>isn't likely at such a time to indulge in feelings of
</p>
<p>petty spite or practical joking, is he, now? "
</p>
<p>" I should say not, decidedly. But why were you
</p>
<p>so sure that he wrote it ? "
</p>
<p>" Because the doctors say he could have done it,
</p>
<p>and that there are few circumstances of death like
</p>
<p>that under which such a thing could happen. And
</p>
<p>it strikes me that to assume somebody else did it in
</p>
<p>face of such a report, is taking too much advantage
</p>
<p>of what must be in that case a remarkable coinci-
</p>
<p>dence.
</p>
<p>" Coincidences happen," said the chief shortly.
</p>
<p>" So they do. But in nine hundred and ninety-

</p>
<p>endeavored to throw us off by such a ruse, the
</p>
<p>medical examiner would discover the trick at a
</p>
<p>glance, and denounce the writing as a fraud."
</p>
<p>" Even so. How do you know what North had
</p>
<p>in his mind to write ? He might have started in to
</p>
<p>declare ' Stackhouse is my executor,' or ' Stack-
</p>
<p>house inherits my property,' or 'Stackhouse is '
</p>
<p>anything else you may please to imagine."
</p>
<p>" True," said Applebee doubtfully.
</p>
<p>" And then, again we are not unquestionably
</p>
<p>sure that the writing is intended for Stackhouse,
</p>
<p>are we ? "
</p>
<p>" After two hours of inspection and experiment,
</p>
<p>I am fully persuaded that it cannot be anything
</p>
<p>else."
</p>
<p>" And how does Stackhouse himself impress
</p>
<p>you ? "
</p>
<p>" Confound the man ! He puzzles me. I had
</p>
<p>a long talk with him this morning. He carries a
</p>
<p>32-calibre pistol. There are no signs of its having
</p>
<p>been recently discharged."
</p>
<p>" I presume he knows how to clean it," said the
</p>
<p>chief inspector dryly.
</p>
<p>" No doubt ; and how to fire it, too. But what
</p>
<p>good does that do us ? I put the case to him
</p>
<p>plainly. I said, ' Stackhouse, this is no time for
</p>
<p>conventionalities. People are beginning to talk.
</p>
<p>Better clear it up at once by giving me an alibi'
</p>

</p>
<p>THE INSPECTOR 'S NEW E VIDENCE. 95
</p>
<p>" Looks bad."
</p>
<p>" So it does. But the queerest thing is that he is
</p>
<p>not living at home. Where did Thornton Stack-
</p>
<p>house spend last night ? At his house at the
</p>
<p>beach, where the women folk would certainly be
</p>
<p>expected to need him at such a time as this, of all
</p>
<p>times ? No, sir. At the Adams House."
</p>
<p>" That means trouble in the family."
</p>
<p>" And very serious trouble. Men quarrel with
</p>
<p>their wives often enough ; but not often under
</p>
<p>such circumstances as these."
</p>
<p>" How did you find the family ? "
</p>
<p>" Frightened to death. Stupid. Idiotic. Stack-
</p>
<p>house's wife alone preserves her senses, and she is
</p>
<p>a tartar. She seemed to take my visit as a personal
</p>
<p>affront, and read me a lecture on propriety. I con-
</p>
<p>fess I lost my temper. ' Do you intend to hinder
</p>
<p>justice all you can, or to help it ? ' said I. ' It's
</p>
<p>not in my province to do either,' she said, with a
</p>
<p>defiant look in her eye. ' I shall let justice take
</p>
<p>its course.' I can forgive a young woman with
</p>
<p>plenty of money for doing a great deal, but there's
</p>
<p>such a thing as overdoing the high and mighty.
</p>
<p>I couldn't imagine what made her seem so unmoved
</p>
<p>by her father's death till I learned that she's not
</p>
<p>his daughter after all."
</p>
<p>" No ? "
</p>
<p>" An adopted child."

</p>
<p>96 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>" Watch that woman."
</p>
<p>" You may be sure I shall."
</p>
<p>" How about the other daughter ? "
</p>
<p>" She's his own daughter, but I didn't see her.
</p>
<p>I was given to understand she was completely
</p>
<p>prostrated by her father's death. She is between
</p>
<p>seventeen and eighteen years old, and I doubt if
</p>
<p>she could help us at all."
</p>
<p>" But all this doesn't explain what has unsettled
</p>
<p>your ideas about Stackhouse. So far you have
</p>
<p>only confirmed your own suspicions."
</p>
<p>" Ah, but there have been several new facts. At
</p>
<p>an early hour this morning, I deputed two men to
</p>
<p>make a thorough canvass of the neighborhood for
</p>
<p>the purpose of ascertaining whether anybody had
</p>
<p>been seen going in or coming out of the North
</p>
<p>house on the night of the murder. Unfortunately
</p>
<p>the people who live directly opposite, who would
</p>
<p>be more likely to have observed than anybody else,
</p>
<p>left for Newport yesterday morning. Still, we have
</p>
<p>found a servant girl, Hannah Doyle, who lives
</p>
<p>several houses further down. This woman posi-
</p>
<p>tively declares that when she was returning home
</p>
<p>after dark about half-past nine on Thursday night,
</p>
<p>she saw a woman a young woman, she believes
</p>
<p>come down the steps of the North house and walk
</p>
<p>away."
</p>
<p>" The deuce she did ! Can she not be mistaken
</p>
<p>in the house ? "
</p>
<p>"She says not. What made her notice the woman

</p>
<p>and remember the circumstance was the peculiar
</p>
<p>THE INSPECTOR 'S NK W VIDENCE. 97
</p>
<p>fact that anybody should be coming out of a house
</p>
<p>boarded up for the summer. And no other house
</p>
<p>for several doors except the North house is boarded
</p>
<p>up."
</p>
<p>" This is important, Applebee."
</p>
<p>" I think so."
</p>
<p>" Half-past nine must have been later than the
</p>
<p>murder. Consequently the woman must have been
</p>
<p>the criminal or an accomplice."
</p>
<p>" She could not have failed to know that North
</p>
<p>had been killed even if she had no part in the deed.
</p>
<p>The fact that she gave no alarm has not spoken a
</p>
<p>word since declares her complicity."
</p>
<p>" It seems proof positive."
</p>
<p>" Another fact, if you please. I have discovered
</p>
<p>that North had somewhere in his possession a
</p>
<p>32-calibre pistol. That pistol was presumably in
</p>
<p>the Marlboro Street house on the night of the
</p>
<p>murder. I have searched the premises from top
</p>
<p>to bottom without finding a trace of it."
</p>
<p>" That has an odd look, too."
</p>
<p>" But," continued Applebee, with a meaning
</p>
<p>emphasis, " I did find the box of cartridges nearly
</p>
<p>filled in a drawer of the writing desk in the library
</p>
<p>where the man was shot. The drawer was closed,
</p>
<p>but the box was open."
</p>
<p>" Important," said the chief inspector, quickly.
</p>
<p>" Important. Now, how thorough has been your
</p>
<p>search of the premises ? "
</p>
<p>" I did not take any chances. I took two men

</p>
<p>with me. We even visited the coal bins and exam-
</p>
<p>98 WRITTEN IN RED,
</p>
<p>ined the ash barrels in detail. Stackhouse has been
</p>
<p>eager to afford us any help. He has given us every
</p>
<p>key we asked for. The search has been thorough.
</p>
<p>The pistol is not there."
</p>
<p>" So then it only remains to discover who that
</p>
<p>woman was."
</p>
<p>" So it seems."
</p>
<p>" Have you no clue ? "
</p>
<p>" Just one."
</p>
<p>" Of what nature ? "
</p>
<p>" A perfume. To be sure, there is a handker-
</p>
<p>chief, but it is unmarked, and I have inquired at
</p>
<p>the stores where they sell such things, to no pur-
</p>
<p>pose. I told you where and when I found that bit
</p>
<p>of lace. It was upon the stairs, between the second
</p>
<p>and third floors, not a great many steps from the
</p>
<p>door of the library, and it had not been lying there
</p>
<p>any fifteen days, which is the length of time the
</p>
<p>family have been away."
</p>
<p>" How do you know ? "
</p>
<p>" Bless you, I took it to a chemist. He assured
</p>
<p>me that to be as fresh as that the perfume must
</p>
<p>have been applied within two days at the longest.
</p>
<p>It is one of those volatile preparations that soon
</p>
<p>lose their strength."
</p>
<p>" I don't see but your chain is complete, then, so
</p>
<p>far as it goes. No man ever carried that handker-
</p>
<p>chief. It must have been dropped by a woman.
</p>
<p>The woman was seen coming away after the hour
</p>
<p>at which the crime was committed. You haven't

</p>
<p>forgotten that perfume, I trust."
</p>
<p>THE INSPECTOR 'S NE W E VIDENCE. 99
</p>
<p>" Assuredly not. If I ever get near enough to
</p>
<p>the woman who uses it but that's the trouble.
</p>
<p>I'm afraid she's not apt to pay me a visit."
</p>
<p>" You must visit her, then. Meanwhile, what
</p>
<p>about the threatening letter which was written to
</p>
<p>North a week or two previous to the crime ? "
</p>
<p>" Bless me ! I had nearly forgotten it. But
</p>
<p>what are we to do ? The decoy letter is still un-
</p>
<p>claimed at the post office."
</p>
<p>" Put an expert on to the handwriting. Get
</p>
<p>samples of the chirography of everybody who is
</p>
<p>likely to have suffered by the operation of the firm."
</p>
<p>The idea was so feasible that Inspector Applebee
</p>
<p>determined to put it into effect at once. He left
</p>
<p>headquarters and hurried to the office of North
</p>
<p>& Stackhouse, where he hoped to find the junior
</p>
<p>partner.
</p>
<p>Disregarding the crape on the door, which kept
</p>
<p>away less importunate visitors, Inspector Applebee
</p>
<p>rattled at the handle, and was quietly admitted by
</p>
<p>old Jobson, who seemed to have the outer office all
</p>
<p>to himself.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Stackhouse?" said the inspector.
</p>
<p>The old clerk covered his eyes with his left hand
</p>
<p>and pointed to the door of the inner office. Apple-
</p>
<p>bee understood the unspoken premonition of the
</p>
<p>old man.
</p>
<p>"Poor old fool!" he thought; "he thinks the
</p>
<p>hour of the firm's disgrace has come, and that I
</p>
<p>am here to arrest his employer. Well, may be I

<p>shall, some day. But not yet not yet."
</p>
<p>100 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>He pushed open the door and went in without
</p>
<p>ceremony. Thornton Stackhouse started up from
</p>
<p>the desk at which he had been writing, his face
</p>
<p>flushed, his manner agitated.
</p>
<p>The inspector expected some word of greeting
</p>
<p>a grunt or a nod, if nothing more. But Stackhouse
</p>
<p>drew a full breath, set his teeth, and seemed to be
</p>
<p>waiting.
</p>
<p>" Bless me ! " thought the inspector ; " he ex-
</p>
<p>pects it, too ! "
</p>
<p>" Well, Stackhouse," he said, with a reassuring
</p>
<p>smile ; " is there anything new in the case?"
</p>
<p>Stackhouse sighed and shook his head wearily.
</p>
<p>His dry lips murmured :
</p>
<p>" Nothing."
</p>
<p>He evidently understood that there was still a
</p>
<p>respite, but it did not seem to comfort him. His
</p>
<p>eye suddenly fell upon the paper on which he had
</p>
<p>been recently writing. He furtively seized it in his
</p>
<p>hand and crumpled it.
</p>
<p>The inspector, who observed this, immediately
</p>
<p>began to appear indifferent to Stackhouse's actions,
</p>
<p>and pretending to turn toward Jobson, stated his
</p>
<p>purpose in calling.
</p>
<p>Stackhouse falling into the trap, seized the op-
</p>
<p>portunity to tear the writing paper into strips, and
</p>
<p>cast it into the waste basket.
</p>
<p>" May I be shot ! " was the inspector's inward
</p>
<p>ejaculation, " if that basket goes out of my
</p>
<p>sight till I have gathered up those bits of torn

<p>paper."
</p>
<p>THE INSPECTOR 'S NE W E VIDENCE. ioi
</p>
<p>Meanwhile he continued to talk about the threat-
</p>
<p>ening letter to North, which he held in his hand.
</p>
<p>" It's altogether probable, Mr. Stackhouse," said
</p>
<p>the inspector, "that we have a very important piece
</p>
<p>of evidence here. It will require the most careful
</p>
<p>examination. Plainly, this is largely a matter of
</p>
<p>handwriting that we have to deal with. You have
</p>
<p>your stock books and so on available ? I supposed
</p>
<p>as much. Be good enough to have the books, with
</p>
<p>all the correspondence of the firm that you can
</p>
<p>secure, brought here. I will have an expert in
</p>
<p>handwriting secured at once. Of course until after
</p>
<p>the funeral, your office will be closed ? Very good ;
</p>
<p>we shall be able to work uninterruptedly for a day
</p>
<p>or two."
</p>
<p>Gradually all traces of Stackhouse's agitation
</p>
<p>disappeared. He accompanied the inspector into
</p>
<p>the outer office. The books were got out, Jobson
</p>
<p>was sent after the writing expert, and Stackhouse
</p>
<p>seemed to be eager and absorbed in the new quest.
</p>
<p>Applebee's opportunity came at last. Going into
</p>
<p>the inner office upon the first reasonable pretext,
</p>
<p>he hastily transferred the contents of the waste
</p>
<p>basket to his hat. Fortunately he had a large head,
</p>
<p>and his hat was capacious.
</p>
<p>After the arrival of the writing expert the inspec-
</p>
<p>tor did not linger long at the office. He suddenly
</p>
<p>discovered an errand. In five minutes he was
</p>
<p>locked in a private office alone, excitedly compar-
</p>
<p>ing, arranging, searching, and pasting. As the

</p>
<p>and a little mucilage soon effected a restoration
</p>
<p>of the whole. And this was the inspector's re-
</p>
<p>ward :
</p>
<p>" Oh, Marion ! Oh, my beautiful and cruel
</p>
<p>wife ! I will not ask you to have pity on me, for
</p>
<p>I know you hate and despise me. I will not ask
</p>
<p>you to think of my suffering and despair, for I
</p>
<p>know you have made up your mind that I deserve
</p>
<p>the worst misfortune that a guilty conscience can
</p>
<p>inflict. But, oh, for your own sake, I beg of you

<p>to tell me what that wicked and unscrupulous wo-

</p>
<p>APPLEBEE IS TAKEN BY SURPRISE.
</p>
<p>THE course of professional duty which brought
</p>
<p>Detective Lamm to Swampscott shore on Fri-
</p>
<p>day also brought to the North villa, on the day
</p>
<p>following, Mr. Kingman F. Thomas.
</p>
<p>A young and timid gentleman, of many aspira-
</p>
<p>tions but too little confidence, had been deputed to
</p>
<p>call at the house for such news as might be attain-
</p>
<p>able. But Moffett, in all his dignity before he
</p>
<p>had looked at Mr. Lamm's warning figure Mof-
</p>
<p>fett had repelled the novice in newspaper work ;
</p>
<p>and when Mr. Thomas reported himself for duty
</p>
<p>on Saturday morning, among the work deputed to
</p>
<p>him for the day was a visit to the North household
</p>
<p>at Swampscott.
</p>
<p>Other newspaper duties so far encroached upon
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas's time that it was not until evening
</p>
<p>that he took the train for Swampscott, and it was
</p>
<p>growing dark when he reached the house, which
</p>
<p>appeared almost deserted.
</p>
<p>But Mr. Thomas's vigorous ring at the bell was
</p>
<p>answered by a pretty maid in mourning, to whom
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas confided the fact that he was a friend
</p>
<p>of the late master of the house, and would be glad
</p>
<p>of the opportunity to see Miss Harwood.

<p>Aunt Comfort in due time surged through the

<p>admit the comfortable passage of her portly form.

<p>" This is Miss Harwood ? " said Mr. Thomas.

<p>and to beg that, if my services in any capacity will
</p>
<p>be of value, you will do me the favor of putting
</p>
<p>them to the best use, though I know that, with Miss
</p>
<p>Harwood as head of the bereaved household,
</p>
<p>nothing has been left undone." This with a
</p>
<p>deferential bow.
</p>
<p>Aunt Comfort sighed heavily, and then sat down
</p>
<p>resignedly.
</p>
<p>"' It's a great trial, Mr. Mr. Thomas, thank you,
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas. So many things, too, have come
</p>
<p>upon me. The poor young ladies are entirely over-
</p>
<p>come, and I have had to supervise all that has
</p>
<p>been done. But it's my place to do it my place.
</p>
<p>Oh, Mr* Thomas, can you tell me one thing
</p>
<p>where is my poor brother-in-law's body ? "
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas, prepared for almost any possible
</p>
<p>query, found it entirely out of his power to under-
</p>
<p>stand the purport of such a question addressed to
</p>
<p>him.
</p>

<p>after the matter. What can everybody be thinking
</p>
<p>APPLE BEE IS TAKEN BY SURPRISE. 105
</p>
<p>about, with the Stewart body-stealing case so recent
</p>
<p>in mind, not to make sure that poor Mr. North's
</p>
<p>corpse is not stolen and held for ransom ? "
</p>
<p>Aunt Comfort swayed forward and back, and
</p>
<p>looked appealingly at the old-fashioned hall clock
</p>
<p>in the corner.
</p>
<p>" I will make careful inquiries, madam, if you
</p>
<p>wish it," said the reporter, " when I return to the
</p>
<p>city."
</p>
<p>" Thank you. Oh, thank you ! A-h ! "
</p>
<p>" But I am confident that everything will be prop-
</p>
<p>erly managed. There is Mr. Stackhouse."
</p>
<p>" Oh, sir, you don't know. I couldn't say a
</p>
<p>word about the matter, not even to Mr. North's
</p>
<p>friend. But I will remark that circumstances have
</p>
<p>taken such a strange turn that Mr. Stackhouse will
</p>
<p>not be much concerned in the funeral arrangements.
</p>
<p>The only gentleman who is doing anything is Mr.
</p>
<p>Fetridge a friend of the family ; and I am so over-
</p>
<p>wrought and troubled by these terrible events, Mr.
</p>
<p>Mr. (Thomas, thank you), that I hardly know
</p>
<p>whether to hope he can be of much service to us
</p>
<p>or not."
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas brought his most approved glance
</p>
<p>of sympathy to bear upon the good old lady.
</p>
<p>"You must be calm and firm, madam," he sug-
</p>
<p>gested. " Remember that everything depends on
</p>
<p>you the young ladies look to you, naturally, in a
</p>
<p>time like this."
</p>
<p>" Ah-h-h ! " ejaculated Aunt Comfort. " They

</p>
<p>are acting very strangely. Of course, I couldn't
</p>
<p>106 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>think of saying anything against them, for I
</p>
<p>love the poor girls, both of them ; but I must
</p>
<p>say, sir, that it has been a trial to me to see how
</p>
<p>recklessly they have gone on here, without even
</p>
<p>listening to good advice."
</p>
<p>" The effect of the sudden shock," hinted Mr.
</p>
<p>Thomas, respectfully. " They need a little disin-
</p>
<p>terested counsel, my dear madam. Now if I could
</p>
<p>only see them as their father's friend and have a
</p>
<p>little talk with the young ladies, I am sure they
</p>
<p>would see matters in their true light and realize
</p>
<p>what a blessing it is to have such a prop and stay
</p>
<p>as you in a time like this."
</p>
<p>Aunt Comfort furtively wiped her eyes, as she
</p>
<p>again swayed back and forth shaking her head.
</p>
<p>" You are very kind and thoughtful, Mr. Mr.
</p>
<p>(Thomas, thank you) and, you being a friend of
</p>
<p>their poor dead father, perhaps the girls will heed
</p>
<p>what you say. I would not think of allowing a
</p>
<p>stranger to see them. There were two callers here
</p>
<p>yesterday. One was a police detective. Perhaps
</p>
<p>he had a right to come. But the other was only an
</p>
<p>inquisitive inspector. Whether gas or water in-
</p>
<p>spector I really do not know, Mr. Thomas. He
</p>
<p>forgot his place and the proprieties, sir, so far as
</p>
<p>to ask questions about poor Mr. North oh, dear,
</p>
<p>dear, to think that we none of us know where the
</p>
<p>body is at this moment but it is a satisfaction to
</p>
<p>me, sir, so far as a poor woman can have a feeling
</p>
<p>of satisfaction under such a terrible dispensation as

</p>
<p>this it is a satisfaction to know that the gas man,
</p>
<p>APPLEBEE IS TAKEN BY SURPRISE. 107
</p>
<p>or water man, or whatever he was, with his badge
</p>
<p>on his breast, went away none the wiser."
</p>
<p>"He was an impertinent fellow," Mr. Thomas
</p>
<p>commented. " I wish I knew his name I might
</p>
<p>have him removed for such prying intrusion. You
</p>
<p>managed him beautifully, madam, I know. But
</p>
<p>there are some women "
</p>
<p>The reporter did not think it necessary to finish
</p>
<p>the sentence. Aunt Comfort's face showed that
</p>
<p>she appreciated the implied compliment.
</p>
<p>" He gave me his name, sir, but I have almost
</p>
<p>forgotten it. Peachwasp no, that wasn't it.
</p>
<p>Pearfly Pearfly some such name as that. It was
</p>
<p>not a common name."
</p>
<p>Mentally, Mr. Thomas quite agreed with the
</p>
<p>lady on this point, though it was some time before,
</p>
<p>by a process of evolution, he was able to compre-
</p>
<p>hend the fact that this unsatisfied visitor was no less
</p>
<p>important a personage than Inspector Applebee,
</p>
<p>of Boston.
</p>
<p>" And the young ladies ? " Mr. Thomas ventured
</p>
<p>to hint after a respectable pause. " This Mr. Fet-
</p>
<p>ridge is known to them and to you, of course he
</p>
<p>is a friend of the family ? "
</p>
<p>" Oh, dear me, yes, sir," was Aunt Comfort's
</p>
<p>reply. " He has been a frequent visitor here for
</p>
<p>let me see, let me see, it must be three years at the
</p>
<p>very least since we first made his acquaintance.
</p>
<p>There was a time when he didn't come so much,
</p>
<p>and we thought perhaps there had been some dis-

<p>agreement between him and poor Mr. North. But
</p>
<p>I08 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>he began to come again to the house, just as before.
</p>
<p>Yes, Mr. Fetridge has been very friendly with both
</p>
<p>our young ladies."
</p>
<p>" I never heard Mr. North speak of Mr. Fet-
</p>
<p>ridge," said Thomas. " But if you know him to
</p>
<p>be trustworthy and honorable that is certainly suffi-
</p>
<p>cient assurance."
</p>
<p>" Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Here I have been
</p>
<p>keeping you from the ladies. I am sure they will
</p>
<p>be very ready to see a friend of their father.
</p>
<p>And I do hope they will hear what you have
</p>
<p>to say."
</p>
<p>" I can advise them to no better course, my dear
</p>
<p>madam, than to follow your own good counsel,"
</p>
<p>said the reporter as Aunt Comfort took her pant-
</p>
<p>ing course toward the door.
</p>
<p>Sitting in his chair he could easily follow Aunt
</p>
<p>Comfort's progress by her ejaculations, partly
</p>
<p>natural, partly the result of her excitement of mind.
</p>
<p>As he waited her return, he thought, with pardon-
</p>
<p>able self-complacency, on the facts which the good
</p>
<p>woman had disclosed, and wondered if it would be
</p>
<p>his good fortune to find the young North ladies
</p>
<p>half so ready to speak. He was aroused from his
</p>
<p>reflections by the reappearance of Aunt Comfort at
</p>
<p>the door.
</p>
<p>But Mr. Thomas had no thought for the excel-
</p>
<p>lent aunt after his eyes fell on her companions.
</p>
<p>Both young ladies were in mourning, and as they
</p>
<p>advanced, side by side, behind Aunt Comfort, it

</p>
<p>would have been difficult, thought Mr. Thomas, to
</p>
<p>APPLEBEE IS TAKEN BY SURPRISE. 109
</p>
<p>find two beautiful women more sharply and strongly
</p>
<p>in contrast.
</p>
<p>The elder of the two responded to Mr. Thomas's
</p>
<p>bow, looked at him a moment with searching blue
</p>
<p>eyes that seemed to read the whole truth as to
</p>
<p>the motive which had brought him there, and then
</p>
<p>took her seat. In her haughty, handsome face the
</p>
<p>reporter saw the character of a woman of strong
</p>
<p>will and passions, tempered by pride and sensi-
</p>
<p>tiveness, rather than by power of reason and
</p>
<p>calm judgment. Her face would certainly never
</p>
<p>have furnished a sculptor with a model for
</p>
<p>Justice.
</p>
<p>How different in all characteristics of woman-
</p>
<p>hood was the shrinking, tearful girl at her side
</p>
<p>scarcely seventeen, Thomas thought, as he looked
</p>
<p>at her pale, rounded face, and her slender, graceful
</p>
<p>figure. She lifted her eyes once to meet and
</p>
<p>acknowledge his glance, and her look of mingled
</p>
<p>appeal, fear, sorrow, and helplessness went straight
</p>
<p>to his heart.
</p>
<p>" This is Mrs. I would say Mr. North's elder
</p>
<p>daughter," Aunt Comfort introduced Marion.
</p>
<p>" And this is Miss Stella, his younger child. My
</p>
<p>dear girls, this is a friend of your poor father,
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas. He takes a deep interest in your
</p>
<p>welfare, and will only be too grateful, he says, if he
</p>
<p>can be of some service."
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas inwardly congratulated himself that
</p>
<p>his was a real and no simulated interest in the case,
</p>

</p>
<p>for he felt perfectly sure that the orbs of this
</p>
<p>HO WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>blonde-haired, stately reserved woman would detect
</p>
<p>in an instant any pretence.
</p>
<p>It was to Marion that he turned, but his thoughts,
</p>
<p>not less than his sympathies, were with her delicate,
</p>
<p>grief-stricken companion.
</p>
<p>"I do not know that Mr. North had a single
</p>
<p>enemy in his business affairs," he began, " yet it
</p>
<p>seems plain that somehow or other he had gained
</p>
<p>the hostility of some person, and that person must
</p>
<p>have been concerned in this terrible crime."
</p>
<p>"Just what the police detective said," Aunt
</p>
<p>Comfort interposed. " But if Mr. North had an
</p>
<p>enemy, it was certainly no one in this house."
</p>
<p>She looked around for some words of confirma-
</p>
<p>tion, but Stella was still quietly crying, and Marion
</p>
<p>said nothing.
</p>
<p>" Cannot you think of any person," resumed Mr.
</p>
<p>Thomas, " who might have had a grudge against
</p>
<p>your father? Any discharged employe?" He
</p>
<p>looked at Marion.
</p>
<p>"I have no knowledge or suspicion of any such
</p>
<p>person," she said, coldly. " Possibly Miss Har-
</p>
<p>wood may recall "
</p>
<p>" Mercy, child ! " exclaimed Aunt Comfort, re-
</p>
<p>lapsing into old-time idioms in her excitement.
</p>
<p>" How you talk ! There never was a servant dis-
</p>
<p>charged in this house but one parlor-maid, who was
</p>
<p>caught stealing Miss Stella's ribbons. May be,
</p>
<p>though," she added with a sudden thought. " She
</p>
<p>was a quick-tempered creature. Did she ever use

</p>
<p>threatening language, Stella ? "
</p>
<p>APPLEBEE IS TAtfEN BY SURPRISE, m
</p>
<p>" Oh, no, Aunt Comfort," said the younger girl
</p>
<p>in broken tones. " Please do not ask me any ques-
</p>
<p>tions. I cannot answer them."
</p>
<p>" Let me speak for my sister as well as myself,
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas," declared Marion, rising. " We
</p>
<p>neither of us have any idea whatever to express as
</p>
<p>to the possible or probable guilt of any one. We
</p>
<p>thank you for your proffer of assistance, but will
</p>
<p>not trouble you further at this time. Come, Aunt
</p>
<p>Comfort. Good evening, sir."
</p>
<p>The two young ladies had left the room, with
</p>
<p>Aunt Comfort in unwilling tow like some un-
</p>
<p>wieldy, harmless barge, before Mr. Thomas realized
</p>
<p>that the conference was at an end. One pleasant
</p>
<p>association only he carried away with him, the charm
</p>
<p>of the presence of the younger girl, whose gentle
</p>
<p>inclination of the head as she looked at him just
</p>
<p>before leaving the room seemed to accentuate his
</p>
<p>feeling that here was a helpless, beautiful girl, who
</p>
<p>appealed to his sympathetic interest, and whom, if
</p>
<p>occasion should come, he would most gladly serve.
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas, as he wrote of the day's develop-
</p>
<p>ments in the North case, graphically presented
</p>
<p>certain facts, but kept others, quite as important,
</p>
<p>untold. Among these undisclosed matters the
</p>
<p>name and standing of Richard Fetridge in the North
</p>
<p>household were included.
</p>
<p>There is no " rest day " in the reporter's week.
</p>
<p>Sunday came and brought to Mr. Thomas new
</p>
<p>duties. In all the daily papers of Saturday this

<p>announcement had appeared :
</p>
<p>H2 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>" The funeral of the late Paul North will take place from his
</p>
<p>late residence, Swampscott, at three o'clock P.M. on Sunday.
</p>
<p>June 19. Relatives and friends invited without further notice.
</p>
<p>Burial private."
</p>
<p>In the throng that pressed into the house of
</p>
<p>mourning, it would have taken attentive observation
</p>
<p>to single out Mr. Thomas. But he was there among
</p>
<p>the first ; a nod of recognition, given and returned,
</p>
<p>secured for him a place, after his own heart, where
</p>
<p>he could see all and not be seen. From this point
</p>
<p>of vantage, Thomas looked over the assemblage
</p>
<p>quite at his leisure, and noted many a face familiar
</p>
<p>in State Street and on 'Change.
</p>
<p>Rather a young man in black, whom he remem-
</p>
<p>bered to have seen often, was escorted to a place of
</p>
<p>some prominence. He exchanged some whispered
</p>
<p>words with those in authority, and Mr. Thomas set
</p>
<p>him down, unhesitatingly, as Richard Fetridge.
</p>
<p>And Richard Fetridge it was, and none other.
</p>
<p>Thornton Stackhouse, looking worn and almost
</p>
<p>haggard, appeared on the threshhold of the great
</p>
<p>parlors. He had been looked for obviously, for he
</p>
<p>was at once approached by the master of cere-
</p>
<p>monies, with his mourning face, and escorted to the
</p>
<p>seat reserved for him not far from the family group.
</p>
<p>By some potent influence, Mr. Thomas's eyes, as
</p>
<p>well as his thoughts, were turned toward these
</p>
<p>silent, motionless women. Once more, it was not
</p>
<p>Marion but Stella who seemed to appeal to his heart.
</p>
<p>Once only he caught sight of her face, and its

<p>pathetic, frightened look again touched him nearly.
</p>
<p>APPLEBEE IS TAKEN BY SURPRISE. 113
</p>
<p>" What would I not give," he thought, almost
</p>
<p>wondering at the sudden feeling, " for the oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity to help that poor girl ! How I wish it were
</p>
<p>in my power to give her courage and hope."
</p>
<p>Miss Harwood sat with Marion and Stella on
</p>
<p>either side, closely veiled. No other relatives were
</p>
<p>present, for Paul North's only brother a Chicago
</p>
<p>merchant was abroad with his family.
</p>
<p>As the sweet, mournful strains of the funeral
</p>
<p>anthem were heard, the searching eye of Mr.
</p>
<p>Thomas noted the presence, in a seat not far from
</p>
<p>the central group, of the worthy Inspector Applebee.
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas's mental surmise was quite correct.
</p>
<p>Inspector Applebee was there on business. But
</p>
<p>the outcome of that visit surprised no one more
</p>
<p>than the officer from police headquarters.
</p>
<p>The brief service had ended ; the assemblage
</p>
<p>rose respectfully to permit the special mourners to
</p>
<p>pass through the room ; and Inspector Applebee
</p>
<p>found himself directly before them as they went on,
</p>
<p>followed by many a sympathetic look
</p>
<p>Aunt Comfort came a little in advance ; and then
</p>
<p>the two orphaned girls, Stella walking on the side
</p>
<p>nearer to the watching inspector.
</p>
<p>A subtle, delicate odor came to his sense as
</p>
<p>Stella stopped for a moment, so near that he might
</p>
<p>have touched her without lifting his arm a faint,
</p>
<p>rare perfume.
</p>
<p>Instantaneously the scent recalled a certain scene
</p>
<p>to the inspector's mind. His thoughts went from

<p>town house in Marlboro Street ; and he seemed to
</p>
<p>find again, where it had lain overlooked in the
</p>
<p>master's house, a bit of filmy lace.
</p>
<p>There could be no mistake, the inspector said
</p>
<p>to himself, outwardly impassive, but every nerve
</p>
<p>quivering with excitement.
</p>
<p>With Stella North, almost as if it were a part of
</p>
<p>herself, came that faint, yet penetrating and subtle
</p>
<p>odor which Inspector Applebee had known in all

<p>his life but once before : when he was keeping

</p>
<p>CHAPTER IX.
</p>
<p>UNDER COVER OF THE NIGHT.
</p>
<p>WHEN the yellow State House dome next came
</p>
<p>into Reporter Thomas's view that Sunday
</p>
<p>after the funeral, he had gained a deal of informa-
</p>
<p>tion about the people at the North villa.
</p>
<p>Quite naturally, one of the first places he sought
</p>
<p>was the quiet office of Detective Lamm.
</p>
<p>The door being locked between them and possi-
</p>
<p>ble intruders, Mr. Thomas began his disclosures.
</p>
<p>" At the present time, Lamm," he said, giving
</p>
<p>the office chair a twirl before sitting down in it,
</p>
<p>"there are two things which strike me as peculiar.
</p>
<p>There are two men in this case who naturally come
</p>
<p>under suspicion one of them because he has no
</p>
<p>history ; the other because his history is peculiar."
</p>
<p>" And the man with no history is ?"
</p>
<p>" Thornton Stackhouse. You may or may not
</p>
<p>be aware of the fact that until he appeared in Bos-
</p>
<p>ton ten years ago, he was unknown to anybody in
</p>
<p>these parts, and that of his earlier life there are
</p>
<p>only extant to-day the vaguest and most conflicting
</p>
<p>rumors. He never refers to anything in his life
</p>
<p>more than ten years old. So, as I say, he has no
</p>
<p>history."

<p>" Umha ! " said Lamm ; " as you say, I may or
</p>
<p>may not have been aware of the fact. Well, then,
</p>
<p>as to the other man whose history is peculiar ? "
</p>
<p>" I referred, Lamm, to Mr. Richard Fetridge, the

<p>Apollo Belvidere of State Street, the ideal lady
</p>
<p>killer, the man whose personal appearance is the
</p>
<p>principal thing about him which would at once
</p>
<p>strike an observer.
</p>
<p>" And why does this man begin to appear sus-
</p>
<p>picious to you ? "
</p>
<p>" Because I can't exactly understand his relations
</p>
<p>to the North family, nor his motives in his relations
</p>
<p>to them."
</p>
<p>" Tell me what you know and I'll try to help you."
</p>
<p>" From what people down at the shore gossip, it
</p>
<p>appears that Fetridge made the acquaintance of
</p>
<p>the Norths at Swampscott three years ago. The
</p>
<p>young man was boarding at some hotel, met the
</p>
<p>young ladies, seems to have been particularly struck
</p>
<p>with Marion, the elder daughter, and began to go
</p>
<p>to the house a good deal. People will talk, you
</p>
<p>know, and people said that Fetridge was dead in
</p>
<p>love with the girl, and probably might have married
</p>
<p>her but for old man North's opposition."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! " Mr. Lamm lit a new cigar. " Didn't
</p>
<p>like the young fellow, eh ? "
</p>
<p>" May have liked him well enough, but didn't
</p>
<p>want a man without money for a son-in-law,"
</p>
<p>rejoined Thomas.
</p>
<p>"But Marion was not his own daughter ?"

</p>
<p>old, and he had no expectation of having a child of
</p>
<p>his own ; and North seemed to think as much of
</p>
<p>her after Stella came as before. Of course, one
</p>
<p>way of showing his liking was his anxiety to have
</p>
<p>Marion well married. At all events, the old man
</p>
<p>turned the cold shoulder to Fetridge, who was only
</p>
<p>a struggling lawyer, with nothing but his wits to
</p>
<p>depend on for a living. His visits to the house sud-
</p>
<p>denly stopped. About two months after he ceased
</p>
<p>to call at the place, Marion North became Marion
</p>
<p>Stackhouse."
</p>
<p>"There was plenty of gossip about that event at
</p>
<p>Swampscott, I'll be bound," was the detective's
</p>
<p>comment.
</p>
<p>" Of course. Everybody said she married Stack-
</p>
<p>house for money, although she was in love with the
</p>
<p>other fellow. Some people go so far as to say that
</p>
<p>Marion and Fetridge had some lovers' quarrel, and
</p>
<p>so separated. Other people, with whom Marion is
</p>
<p>no favorite, did not hesitate to say that the young
</p>
<p>woman, being one of the cool and calculating kind,
</p>
<p>agreed with her fathe-r that Stackhouse was a cer-
</p>
<p>tainty and the young lawyer only a possibility so
</p>
<p>far as money interests were concerned."
</p>
<p>" Fetridge is a rich man now," oracularly declared
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm.
</p>
<p>" Ah ! If friend North had dreamed that in a
</p>
<p>few weeks Fetridge would fall heir to a very hand-
</p>
<p>some property in Australia, I think our friend
</p>
<p>Stackhouse would have been dismissed for the

</p>
<p>his fortune. Fetridge went to Australia to settle
</p>
<p>up the estate, as perhaps you know, not in the least
</p>
<p>expecting to get much of anything. But in nine
</p>
<p>months he came home, to everybody's surprise, him-
</p>
<p>self included, a millionaire."
</p>
<p>" Exactly ; well ? "
</p>
<p>" Well, he began to feel drawn toward the Norths
</p>
<p>again. This time the old man was very glad to
</p>
<p>have him on good terms with the family. The
</p>
<p>almighty dollar, you know. I don't mean to slur
</p>
<p>a dead man's memory, but Paul North was a dis-
</p>
<p>ciple of Mammon, if ever there was one in the
</p>
<p>world. The question in everybody's mouth is, how
</p>
<p>did Stackhouse attain his extraordinary influence
</p>
<p>over Paul North ? I attribute it to his cunning
</p>
<p>catering to the old man s strongest passion avarice.
</p>
<p>But not to digress. Fetridge visited the house
</p>
<p>regularly for a month or two, and it was gossiped
</p>
<p>down at the shore that the Apollo had turned his
</p>
<p>attention to Miss Stella. I am not at all certain
</p>
<p>as to the correctness of that assumption myself,
</p>
<p>Lamm."
</p>
<p>" He may have had something of his former lik-
</p>
<p>ing for Marion, you mean ? "
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm found an answering look from his
</p>
<p>co-worker that made a spoken response super-
</p>
<p>fluous.
</p>
<p>" Just about a month ago, Lamm, professional

</p>
<p>quite intimate relations with the firm of North &
</p>
<p>Stackhouse since he came back from Australia with
</p>
<p>his millions. A Water Street man I saw at the
</p>
<p>funeral told me he believed Fetridge backed the
</p>
<p>concern, and went away on some business connected
</p>
<p>with it."
</p>
<p>" That's a mere guess," was the detective's com-
</p>
<p>ment. " We must try to get at the real cause for
</p>
<p>this trip. You do not imagine that any disagree-
</p>
<p>ment with the family or the firm could have been at
</p>
<p>the bottom of it ? "
</p>
<p>" There was no love lost between Stackhouse
</p>
<p>and Fetridge. The cause of their mutual dislike
</p>
<p>may or may not be hard to determine," said Thomas,
</p>
<p>in a meaning tone ; " but I'm very certain, from
</p>
<p>what has taken place since Mr. North's death
</p>
<p>Fetridge did not come back, you know, until two
</p>
<p>days before that he is on quite as good a standing
</p>
<p>with the family as ever. The way in which he was
</p>
<p>trusted in the funeral arrangements shows that
</p>
<p>much, plainly enough."
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm knocked the ashes from his cigar,
</p>
<p>took a turn up the room, and coming back stopped
</p>
<p>in front of Thomas as he sat fingering his watch
</p>
<p>fob.
</p>
<p>" There's a mystery about this man Fetridge,"
</p>
<p>he said with emphasis. "What you have found out
</p>
<p>about him simply confirms my feeling, quite war-
</p>
<p>ranted by my own knowledge of the man and his
</p>
<p>circumstances, that Fetridge is a person to be very

</p>
<p>carefully watched. Mark my words, young man.
</p>
<p>120 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>The day you find out what secret is shared by
</p>
<p>Marion North-Stackhouse and Richard Fetridge
</p>
<p>will mark a great advance in the progress of this
</p>
<p>investigation."
</p>
<p>When detective and reporter parted, after some
</p>
<p>further interchange of views, a certain line of policy
</p>
<p>was agreed upon. Richard Fetridge was to be
</p>
<p>kept constantly in sight. For the goings and com-
</p>
<p>ings of the young lawyer in the city, Mr. Lamm
</p>
<p>declared his purpose to fully account, while Mr.
</p>
<p>Thomas was to be the sentinel on duty at Swamp-
</p>
<p>scott.
</p>
<p>Not that he intended by any means to anchor
</p>
<p>himself down there permanently ; but he did pro-
</p>
<p>pose to provide himself immediately with some
</p>
<p>means by which he should be kept informed of the
</p>
<p>movements of the aforesaid gentleman, and especi-
</p>
<p>ally of his future associations with the North family.
</p>
<p>It was partly with this end in view, but more im-
</p>
<p>mediately with the intention of testing Fetridge by
</p>
<p>a personal interview, that he returned to Swamp-
</p>
<p>scott that very Sunday evening, arriving there just
</p>
<p>after dark. The hand of Destiny was more active
</p>
<p>in this expedition than Mr. Thomas could even in
</p>
<p>the remotest degree have imagined. Not only was
</p>
<p>the course of his own life determined thereby, but
</p>
<p>it is just possible that if he had deferred his visit
</p>
<p>until Monday, as a less eager investigator would
</p>
<p>have done, the North tragedy might have remained
</p>
<p>a mystery forever.

</p>
<p>The slightest delay of the train, a difference in
</p>
<p>UNDER CO VER OF THE NIGHT. 1 2 1
</p>
<p>the rate of his walk through the town, a divergence
</p>
<p>in the course of his thoughts any of these things,
</p>
<p>upon so slender a thread do great events sometimes
</p>
<p>hang would have been equally fatal to his even-
</p>
<p>tual elucidation of the problem or the progress of
</p>
<p>the events recorded in this narrative.
</p>
<p>But it happend that he was passing the North
</p>
<p>estate a little before nine o'clock, and that just then
</p>
<p>the whim seized him to enter the broad gateway
</p>
<p>and have a look at the silent, gloomy mansion upon
</p>
<p>which the heavy pall of death and ill-fortune had
</p>
<p>visibly fallen. There might be something stirring
</p>
<p>some face, some light, some whispered conversation,
</p>
<p>perhaps or was it that the sweet, sad face of North's
</p>
<p>orphaned daughter still haunted him and lured him
</p>
<p>out of his path ?
</p>
<p>At all events it would not necessitate much of a
</p>
<p>delay, for the abiding place of Richard Fetridge
</p>
<p>was but a short distance beyond. At first sight it
</p>
<p>did not seem possible that he should gain anything
</p>
<p>by entering the grounds. There was not even a
</p>
<p>light visible from his standpoint on the driveway.
</p>
<p>It might have been, thought Mr. Thomas, some
</p>
<p>long abandoned ruin for all the semblance of life
</p>
<p>that could be seen about it.
</p>
<p>He was turning away, when his attention was
</p>
<p>attracted by a noise close by him as of a window
</p>
<p>cautiously opened, and immediately after he became
</p>
<p>aware of the flutter of white skirts at a window in
</p>
<p>the second story. Instinctively he drew back into

</p>
<p>the bushes. The night was dark, but the phos-
</p>
<p>122 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>phorescent gleam that seems to distinguish objects
</p>
<p>even in a dark landscape, enabled him to see that
</p>
<p>somebody had emerged from the window and was
</p>
<p>coming down a trellis work into the garden. He
</p>
<p>heard the snapping of the frail wood work, the
</p>
<p>cracking of the vine that clung to it, and finally the
</p>
<p>precipitate, probably unintentional, drop to the
</p>
<p>ground, and the accompanying thud. But the
</p>
<p>figure gathered itself up quickly came toward
</p>
<p>him passed him breathing with audible excite-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>It was a figure veiled and closely muffled in a
</p>
<p>long cloak the figure of a woman.
</p>
<p>" Is it one of the servants ? " Thomas asked
</p>
<p>himself, as he observed her hurried steps until the
</p>
<p>gate was reached, her backward glance, as if hesi-
</p>
<p>tating for a moment whether to go on or to return,
</p>
<p>and then a quick, almost headlong flight directly
</p>
<p>up the street in the direction of Marblehead.
</p>
<p>" She cannot be going to the town, at any rate,
</p>
<p>whoever she may be, 5 ' was Mr. Thomas's mental
</p>
<p>comment. " Is she a thief or a servant ? I shall
</p>
<p>make it my business to know more about the matter,
</p>
<p>at all events."
</p>
<p>With a stealthy tread, quite as noiseless as that
</p>
<p>of the cloaked figure hurrying before him, Thomas
</p>
<p>followed the woman, keeping her as well in sight as
</p>
<p>the darkness would permit.
</p>
<p>Regarding one point there could be no doubt in
</p>
<p>the watcher's mind. The fugitive knew the road

</p>
<p>she was taking, and followed it with a fixed purpose.
</p>
<p>UNDER COVER OF THE NIGHT. 123
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas began to find it a matter of some diffi-
</p>
<p>culty to keep her within view, especially as the thick
</p>
<p>foliage made the darkness in some places very black
</p>
<p>indeed. Suddenly the woman left the road, and ran
</p>
<p>across the lawn of a private estate.
</p>
<p>Thomas hastened after her, expecting to see her
</p>
<p>enter at the servants' door. But, to his surprise,
</p>
<p>she avoided the house, and eventually came out
</p>
<p>upon the rocks behind it, overlooking the sea.
</p>
<p>" She is going out upon the shore," muttered the
</p>
<p>reporter to himself, as he saw her climbing down
</p>
<p>out of view from the higher land on which he stood.
</p>
<p>It was a moonless night, and only now and then
</p>
<p>could be observed the trembling light of a star.
</p>
<p>Most of the sky was heavily overcast, but near the
</p>
<p>eastward, where the cloud and the ocean seemed to
</p>
<p>touch, there was a broad band of comparative
</p>
<p>light.
</p>
<p>Do what he might in the way of precaution, the
</p>
<p>reporter stumbled once and fell heavily. Fearing
</p>
<p>that the sound might have startled the human mag-
</p>
<p>net that had thus drawn him toward the ocean's
</p>
<p>verge, Thomas did not rise for a moment. But
</p>
<p>when he gained his feet and looked cautiously
</p>
<p>ahead, the figure was still going onward at un-
</p>
<p>checked speed.
</p>
<p>" Utterly absorbed in what she has in mind,"
</p>
<p>thought Thomas. " And going straight toward
</p>
<p>the water too ! I don't know much about this dis-
</p>
<p>trict, but I think there is a little point of rocks out

<p>yonder, just in the direction the woman is taking.
</p>
<p>124 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>What if the creature should have come to this
</p>
<p>lonely spot at night to end her life ? "
</p>
<p>Startled at the thought, the reporter made haste,
</p>
<p>so that in case of emergency he might be ready to
</p>
<p>act.
</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer he approached the unknown
</p>
<p>wanderer. She stood still at last upon a rock that
</p>
<p>overhung the water that plashed monotonously
</p>
<p>along the long beach.
</p>
<p>The night wind swayed the folds of her cloak as
</p>
<p>she remained there for a moment like a statue.
</p>
<p>Her veil, too, was blown to one side, but her
</p>
<p>look was out to sea, and the eager eyes of the
</p>
<p>watcher, crouching now in a little grassy hollow
</p>
<p>close at hand, could not catch even a fleeting
</p>
<p>glimpse of her face.
</p>
<p>Suddenly, with a quick motion, the woman drew
</p>
<p>something from her breast, and cast it waterwards
</p>
<p>with all her strength. The effort seemed to ex-
</p>
<p>haust her, for she sank down a moment, clasping
</p>
<p>her hands before her face.
</p>
<p>The weakness was only transient. With nervous
</p>
<p>hands she pulled the veil over her face and wrapped
</p>
<p>the long cloak closely around her. Almost head-
</p>
<p>long was the haste with which the figure turned
</p>
<p>toward the road again.
</p>
<p>Looking neither to right nor left, she passed very
</p>
<p>near the man who had thus played the spy upon
</p>
<p>her. No affrighted fawn, thought Thomas, could
</p>
<p>have run more fleetly, under the spell of any dread

<p>whatsoever.
</p>
<p>UNDER COVER OF THE NIGHT. 125
</p>
<p>For an instant the reporter was in quandary.
</p>
<p>He desired to do two things at once to follow the
</p>
<p>fleeting figure : to stop and investigate. He stood
</p>
<p>up, looking after her.
</p>
<p>" Queer thing ! " he thought. " She is not go-
</p>
<p>ing back to the North villa ; at least, not by the
</p>
<p>same route by which we have come. She continues
</p>
<p>on the road toward the Philips Beach station.
</p>
<p>Can it be that this woman has been kept here in
</p>
<p>hiding, and is going away ? Perhaps, if I hurry, I
</p>
<p>can still overtake her."
</p>
<p>He stumbled hastily across the rocks to the place
</p>
<p>where she had stood when she threw the something,
</p>
<p>which had aroused his curiosity, toward the water.
</p>
<p>It was well nigh a hopeless quest. He stood for a
</p>
<p>moment in the very attitude which he had seen her
</p>
<p>occupy, the lonesome swash of the sea in his ears,
</p>
<p>measuring the distance with his eye, and trying
</p>
<p>to calculate the limit of her force. He walked
</p>
<p>down slowly in a straight line to the very edge
</p>
<p>of the water. The tide seemed very near the
</p>
<p>flood.
</p>
<p>"Quiet hopeless. Not a chance in a million,"
</p>
<p>he said at once. " But if I mark the spot and the
</p>
<p>height of the tide, by daylight to-morrow I can in-
</p>
<p>vestigate with possible chance of success."
</p>
<p>He was looking about him for some object by
</p>
<p>which to secure the necessary landmarks, when his
</p>
<p>glance was attracted to a glittering something on a
</p>
<p>point of rock about which the water flowed. Even

<p>as he looked a wave dashed over it, obscuring it

<p>for the time, only to leave it gleaming in a reflected
</p>
<p>light again as the dark element receded.
</p>
<p>An astonished, incredulous stare ! No, it could
</p>
<p>not be ; yet it would pay him to make sure !
</p>
<p>He drew off his shoes and socks and prepared
</p>
<p>himself for the effort of investigation. A few cau-
</p>
<p>tious steps brought him so near that there could be
</p>
<p>no mistake. He uttered an involuntary cry, and
</p>
<p>plunging forward, regardless of a thorough wetting
</p>
<p>from an unexpected wave, grasped the glistening
</p>
<p>object in his shaking hand.

</p>
<p>It was a pistol !
</p>
<p>CHAPTER X.
</p>
<p>WHO IS SHE?
</p>
<p>IF Reporter Thomas had been previously curious
</p>
<p>about the identity of the fugitive from the North
</p>
<p>household, this curiosity had suddenly intensified
</p>
<p>into acute anxiety now that he had discovered the
</p>
<p>nature of her misson to the water side. Rather
</p>
<p>than she should escape him at this moment he
</p>
<p>would willingly forfeit a month's salary. He felt
</p>
<p>the keen excitement of the man who finds himself
</p>
<p>on the verge of a momentous discovery.
</p>
<p>Thrusting the pistol into his pocket, he hastened
</p>
<p>to assume his clothing, and, at the top of his speed,
</p>
<p>made up the road in the direction the woman had
</p>
<p>gone. He reached the Phillips Beach station, only
</p>
<p>to find it black and deserted. There was the sol-
</p>
<p>itary figure of a man crossing the open space near
</p>
<p>by. Thomas hastened to accost him.
</p>
<p>" Has the last train gone, sir ? " he inquired.
</p>
<p>" Train ! " echoed the man. " There is no train
</p>
<p>from here to-night. The train leaves from Swamp-
</p>
<p>scott station at 9.26. It's not a great way down
</p>
<p>the track, but I'm afraid it's too late," he added,
</p>
<p>looking at his watch.
</p>
<p>A sudden thought came like an inspiration to
</p>
<p>the reporter.

<p>with the coincidence. " I did. She asked me the
</p>
<p>very same question you did, and started off in chase
</p>
<p>for the train, but it was a good ten minutes ago.
</p>
<p>The fact was, the whole thing struck me as so
</p>
<p>peculiar that I went after her a bit, but somehow
</p>
<p>she gave me the slip. I must say I never saw a
</p>
<p>woman who could get over the ground so fast."
</p>
<p>Thomas waited to hear no more, 'but was off like
</p>
<p>an arrow down the dangerously dark road bed.
</p>
<p>It was a fruitless chase. Entirely out of breath,
</p>
<p>he reached the Swampscott station just in time to
</p>
<p>see the doors closed. A man bearing a lantern
</p>
<p>eyed him curiously as he came upon the platform.
</p>
<p>" Last train's gone," he said, curtly.
</p>
<p>" I know," said Mr. Thomas. " It's rather hard
</p>
<p>luck that of mine to-night. Fate's against me
</p>
<p>sure. I had a mishap a ducking, as you see : and
</p>
<p>what with one thing and another, I have been
</p>
<p>baulked every way. I wouldn't care only that a
</p>
<p>lady was to meet me here and go to Boston with
</p>
<p>me in the train."
</p>
<p>" Lady with a veil and long cloak ?"
</p>
<p>" Yes."
</p>
<p>" She went on in the train without you, my friend.
</p>
<p>Sorry for you, but there's one chance yet. You
</p>
<p>may catch that horse car into Boston, by way of
</p>
<p>Lynn, if you hurry."

</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas was perfectly aware of this fact, but
</p>
<p>WHO IS SHR? 129
</p>
<p>he thanked the man with the lantern very grate-
</p>
<p>fully and set out on a run for the corner indicated.
</p>
<p>The car was passing just as he arrived, and
</p>
<p>Thomas went with it as it rattled its slow way into
</p>
<p>Boston a slowness that was magnified a hundred
</p>
<p>fold by the reporter's keen impatience. He was
</p>
<p>anxious to examine the weapon of which he had so
</p>
<p>strangely become possessed, but he did not con-
</p>
<p>sider it prudent to do so until he was free from
</p>
<p>observation. The opportunity arrived at last under
</p>
<p>an electric light, in a quiet street in the city.
</p>
<p>"Calibre?." he mentally commented. "Thirty-
</p>
<p>two! I thought as much. The old-fashioned four-
</p>
<p>barrelled pepper-box of a kind in use before the
</p>
<p>war. Ah! Sharp's patent, 1859. Probably a rem-
</p>
<p>iniscence of North's younger days. Breech-loading
</p>
<p>too. There's no aim to the thing at long range ;
</p>
<p>but it's a deadly weapon in a hand-to-hand conflict.
</p>
<p>And it contains at present ? Let's see. How do
</p>
<p>you get the confounded thing open ? Ah ! by this
</p>
<p>little button above the trigger. So, so. Three
</p>
<p>full cartridges and one empty shell. The smut of
</p>
<p>the powder is still upon the muzzle. Recently
</p>
<p>fired, and not yet cleaned ! Why, what fool could
</p>
<p>have taken so little pains to conceal a guilty
</p>
<p>fact?"
</p>
<p>He hastily thrust the pistol from sight and drew
</p>
<p>a long breath. A coincidence was out of the ques-
</p>
<p>tion. He no longer doubted the importance of his
</p>
<p>discovery. Luck or was it fate ? had strangely

<p>13 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas walked toward Scollay Square in
</p>
<p>deep reflection.
</p>
<p>" Servant or some one in hiding," he queried.
</p>
<p>" One or the other, assuredly. If a servant, we
</p>
<p>must look for another motive than any Lamm and
</p>
<p>I have considered. If some one in hiding, pro-
</p>
<p>tected at the house by some other person knowing
</p>
<p>of the crime, then it is all the more necessary that
</p>
<p>Swampscott should be watched. I may have to
</p>
<p>leave town. If so, Lamm must be kept informed."
</p>
<p>By this time Mr. Thomas had reached the bor-
</p>
<p>ders of the district where life is stirring, n;
</p>
<p>well as day.
</p>
<p>It was late, but not so late that the hack
</p>
<p>always inclined to social propinquity, were not _
</p>
<p>to be found in their accustomed haunts.
</p>
<p>By all the groups gathered in smoky " all night "
</p>
<p>restaurants, or talking over the merits and de-
</p>
<p>merits of their respective teams, Thomas was wel-
</p>
<p>comed as a friend of long standing.
</p>
<p>He took their chaffing about the outward and
</p>
<p>visible signs of his wetting with characteristic good-
</p>
<p>humor ; and between repartees that brought a
</p>
<p>broad grin to the faces of his associates, managed
</p>
<p>to introduce certain terse questions as to the matter
</p>
<p>in hand.
</p>
<p>" Eastern depot ? Why, Big Jim had a fare
</p>
<p>from there to-night. Here, Big Jim, leave off your
</p>
<p>palaver with the dames at that table a moment and
</p>
<p>come and see Thomas ! "

<p>Obedient to the summons, with ready good-will,
</p>

</p>
<p>Big Jim nodded to the reporter, and was presently
</p>
<p>seated with him at a conference carried on by both
</p>
<p>parties in an undertone.
</p>
<p>"The fare was a woman, Thomas."
</p>
<p>" A woman is what I'm looking for."
</p>
<p>" Well, this one was so wrapped up I couldn't
</p>
<p>make much of her looks ; but I will say this, she
</p>
<p>wasn't old, and she was scared at something or
</p>
<p>other almost to death."
</p>
<p>" Where did you take her, Jim ? "
</p>
<p>" To the Albany."
</p>
<p>" To the Albany ! " Thomas's face fell.
</p>
<p>" Yes, sir ; just there. She said to me in a quick
</p>
<p>sort of way, like as if frightened at something,
</p>
<p>1 Hackman, wont you please take this money and
</p>
<p>buy me a ticket for Hartford ? ' To be sure I
</p>
<p>would, and did, old man. The woman was all of
</p>
<p>a tremble when I put the ticket and the change in
</p>
<p>her hand. She mumbled out something or other
</p>
<p>thank you, I suppose and ran to the train,
</p>
<p>although she had fifteen minutes to spare : that
</p>
<p>eleven o'clock express, you know. Something
</p>
<p>wrong with her, of course ? "
</p>
<p>" I don't know that, Jim," answered Thomas,
</p>
<p>cautiously. " I guess she can't be the person I
</p>
<p>wanted after all."
</p>
<p>The two parted excellent friends as always. For
</p>
<p>an hour or more the reporter worked at his desk.
</p>
<p>Then he curled up in his chair for a nap, impress-
</p>

</p>
<p>132 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>When the gong clashed at the Albany station at
</p>
<p>five the next morning, among the passengers on that
</p>
<p>early train well-named " accommodation," was
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas. In one hand he held a copy of the
</p>
<p>city edition of the morning Bosto?i Globe. The other
</p>
<p>held a ticket to Hartford.
</p>
<p>It was 10.30 before the Charter Oak city was
</p>
<p>reached. Mr. Thomas's first efforts brought him
</p>
<p>into contact with the Jehus of the Connecticut
</p>
<p>capital.
</p>
<p>It was not at all a difficult matter to find the
</p>
<p>whereabouts of the solitary hack driver who waited
</p>
<p>for a chance passenger on the night trains ; but
</p>
<p>Tom Ludlow was asleep, and the reporter found
</p>
<p>the time on his hands until noon.
</p>
<p>" How are you, sir ? " said Ludlow, stretching
</p>
<p>himself and yawning as he met the inquirer who had
</p>
<p>been waiting for his awakening. Both were at the
</p>
<p>door of the hotel-stable. " A lady fare ? Yes.
</p>
<p>She's safe enough. Friend of yours relative ! "
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas thereupon set forth, with much
</p>
<p>earnestness, that he had missed the young woman
</p>
<p>through an unavoidable accident, that they were
</p>
<p>going to a friend in Hartford, and that he had been
</p>
<p>much disturbed over the fact that she had been
</p>
<p>obliged to make the journey at night alone.
</p>
<p>" Naturally," he said in closing, " I am anxious
</p>
<p>enough about her. She's a timid girl ; too young
</p>
<p>to be out alone like this. But I couldn't help it. I
</p>
<p>hope you bestowed her safely somewhere. At her

<p>friend's, I suppose ? "
</p>
<p>WHO IS SHE? 133
</p>
<p>The coachman flicked a fly off the post near
</p>
<p>which he was standing with great accuracy.
</p>
<p>" You are wrong there. Her friends were out of
</p>
<p>town. The girl did not know what to do ; cried
</p>
<p>and took on. Course I felt sorry for her, and I
</p>
<p>drove her to the hotel. Knowing the night clerk,
</p>
<p>I just said a word in his ear that the lady was all
</p>
<p>right, and he gave her a room. Curious, though,
</p>
<p>why she'd wrap herself up so ! I didn't get a peek
</p>
<p>at her face at all."
</p>
<p>" She's not been well at all recently. Fact is, the
</p>
<p>journey was partly taken on account of her health,"
</p>
<p>answered the reporter. " But I am greatly indebted
</p>
<p>to you for the kindness you have shown her under
</p>
<p>these unfortunate circumstances. Here's a two-
</p>
<p>dollar bill to prove it. Take it, man ; it's all right.
</p>
<p>And now where is the lady ? "
</p>
<p>" In the house, yonder," returned Ludlow, point-
</p>
<p>ing with his whip. " I registered her name as
</p>
<p>' Miss Brown, Boston.' The clerk will find out for
</p>
<p>you whether she is up yet."
</p>
<p>The City Hotel register bore the name, and the
</p>
<p>clerk listened with professional courtesy to Mr.
</p>
<p>Thomas's statement of the case.
</p>
<p>" We've not seen her yet," he said. "Very likely,
</p>
<p>however, she may be up and dressed by this time.
</p>
<p>I will send up your card if you wish. Front ! "
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas, taking a blank card from the pigeon
</p>
<p>hole, wrote hurriedly the following name, which a
</p>
<p>bell boy soon carried to room X. :

<p>MR. WILLIAM C. WATERSTON.
</p>
<p>134 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>" Whoever she may be, she will be frightened, I
</p>
<p>suppose, at reading this elaborate name," Thomas
</p>
<p>thought. " But I must see her at all hazards."
</p>
<p>In a moment the boy had returned, bearing the
</p>
<p>card in his hand.
</p>
<p>" I knocked two or three times, sir, pretty loud,
</p>
<p>but couldn't make any one answer," he said.
</p>
<p>" There wasn't a sound in the room that I could
</p>
<p>hear."
</p>
<p>The sudden look of alarm on Thomas's face was
</p>
<p>not lost upon the clerk. He glanced at the clock,
</p>
<p>and noted that the hands pointed at half-past twelve.
</p>
<p>" Tell the chambermaid of the floor to open the
</p>
<p>room," he said.
</p>
<p>While the order was being carried out, Thomas
</p>
<p>stood motionless at the desk, the prey of a vague
</p>
<p>apprehension.
</p>
<p>It was the chambermaid herself who came to the
</p>
<p>office with the key of room X. in her hand.
</p>
<p>" There's no one in the room," she declared,
</p>
<p>with eagerness. " The bed has not been slept
</p>
<p>in, and the woman must have stolen away during
</p>
<p>the night."
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas looked blankly into the clerk's face.
</p>
<p>A very slight lifting of the shoulders was the only
</p>
<p>comment of that functionary.
</p>
<p>The reporter caught its meaning. " The poor
</p>
<p>girl must be out of her head, and is wandering about
</p>
<p>somewhere," he said. " Permit me to pay the bill
</p>
<p>for her lodging." The clerk bowed. " Should she

<p>chance to return- while I am away," he added, " you
</p>
<p>WHO IS SHE? 135
</p>
<p>will detain her, I am sure courteously, but firmly.
</p>
<p>How unfortunate ! How very unfortunate ! "
</p>
<p>" It is barely possible that the lady may have
</p>
<p>been frightened away, if she was in a state of
</p>
<p>nervous prostration as you intimate," remarked the
</p>
<p>clerk, more cordial in manner now that the little
</p>
<p>account for the night's lodging had been settled.
</p>
<p>" But, upon my word, I cannot understand why.
</p>
<p>There were only five or six other guests on the
</p>
<p>floor, and they were quite people, all of them."
</p>
<p>Once more Mr. Thomas betook himself to the
</p>
<p>neighborhood of the stable and was fortunate
</p>
<p>enough to find Ludlow there, making ready for his
</p>
<p>accustomed call at the railway depot.
</p>
<p>" Who were in the office when you left the young
</p>
<p>lady last night ? " he asked. " Can you recollect ?"
</p>
<p>Ludlow pondered a moment.
</p>
<p>" Let me see. The night clerk. The night
</p>
<p>porter."
</p>
<p>" Of course. Anybody else ? "
</p>
<p>" Why, yes. Stern was there Officer Stern. A
</p>
<p>policeman, you know. Merely having a friendly
</p>
<p>chat with the clerk."
</p>
<p>" Do you think the lady noticed him ? "
</p>
<p>" May be so may be. Anyhow, Stern noticed
</p>
<p>her. We all did. How could we help it ? Muffled
</p>
<p>up, nervous, hurrying off to her room."
</p>
<p>Quite certain that in this unexpected apparition
</p>
<p>of a policeman, he had found the cause of the dis-
</p>
<p>appearance of the fugitive, Thomas set out once

<p>more on his search.

<p>136 WRITTEN IX RtD.
</p>
<p>The first trace of what might perchance prove to
</p>
<p>be the fugitive was found, half an hour later, at a
</p>
<p>little restaurant much frequented by early market-
</p>
<p>men not far from the waterside.
</p>
<p>" Yes, a woman like you describe came here about
</p>
<p>four o'clock this morning," answered, to Thomas's
</p>
<p>inquiries, the old man who kept the place. " She
</p>
<p>took a cup of coffee and a sandwich and asked me
</p>
<p>the road to Windsor Locks. A very pleasant-
</p>
<p>spoken female. She thanked me kindly through
</p>
<p>her veil when I showed her. I told her she had
</p>
<p>better sit down and rest awhile ; that the streets
</p>
<p>and roads were no place for a woman at that
</p>
<p>hour. Then, if you'll believe it, she started up
</p>
<p>and ran away. She took that street yonder to-
</p>
<p>ward East Hartford bridge. I had half a mind
</p>
<p>to call after her that she was going the wrong way
</p>
<p>if she wanted to get to Windsor Locks, but she was
</p>
<p>out of sight before a cat could wink, and I couldn't
</p>
<p>leave the shop. Out of her head, you tell me?
</p>
<p>Poor creetur !"
</p>
<p>The street which the reporter now followed led
</p>
<p>directly to the river and the bridge separating the
</p>
<p>busy capital from the quiet village of East Hartford.
</p>
<p>A sudden thought as he approached the stream
</p>
<p>sent a chill to his heart. He stopped at the boat-
</p>
<p>house to ask if anybody had been seen to pass
</p>
<p>during the night, but no watch had been kept.
</p>
<p>After most perplexing uncertainty for several mo-
</p>
<p>ments, Thomas decided to cross the river and seek

<p>for developments in the little town beyond.
</p>
<p>WHO IS SHE? 137
</p>
<p>A milk wagon was jogging on to the accompani-
</p>
<p>ment of jingling cans, as Thomas turned into the
</p>
<p>broad main street. It halted at a pleasant farm-
</p>
<p>house not far from the river.
</p>
<p>"Just back from the city?" asked Thomas of
</p>
<p>the pleasant-looking man, with sun-tanned, hairy
</p>
<p>face, as he laid the reins over the back of his
</p>
<p>well-fed bay.
</p>
<p>" Yes, sir. It takes a goodish while to make
</p>
<p>my rounds."
</p>
<p>" Pardon my question, but it is one of great
</p>
<p>interest and importance to me. When did you
</p>
<p>set out ?"
</p>
<p>"A little after four."
</p>
<p>"And did you chance to meet a woman, all
</p>
<p>wrapped up in a cloak, on your way over ? "
</p>
<p>" Ah ! " answered the milkman, interested at once.
</p>
<p>" I told Jim there was something queer about her.
</p>
<p>Yes, I did see her, and stopped her, too, just about
</p>
<p>where you are standing now, sir."
</p>
<p>" The poor woman is not responsible for what
</p>
<p>she is doing," said Thomas. " I am searching for
</p>
<p>her now."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! " The milkman smacked his lips in his
</p>
<p>eagerness. " Take her in charge, eh ? "
</p>
<p>Thomas nodded.
</p>
<p>" Well, sir, she is as quick a traveler afoot as I
</p>
<p>ever see, man or woman ; and goodness only knows
</p>
<p>where she has got to by this time. It was so un-
</p>
<p>common to see such a figure that I took a pretty

</p>
<p>and I put myself right in the way all of a sudden
</p>
<p>on purpose. She gave a little frightened scream,
</p>
<p>and put out her hand to me appealing like. It was
</p>
<p>as white a hand as I ever see, sir ; she's never had
</p>
<p>any rough work to do, I'll be bound, poor thing ! "
</p>
<p>" ' I'm not meaning you any harm,' I says to her,
</p>
<p>while Jim, like an idiot, stood staring at her over
</p>
<p>the gate with his mouth open. ' But for a young
</p>
<p>woman like you to be racing along mad-like at this
</p>
<p>hour of the night, it isn't exactly the right thing, is
</p>
<p>it, miss? I put it to you frankly, you know.' She
</p>
<p>clasped her hands despairingly, and said, ' You
</p>
<p>don't know! You can't know ! Do not try to
</p>
<p>stop me, for mercy's sake ! ' But I see the poor
</p>
<p>thing was wellnigh fagged out, and I just took
</p>
<p>her arm and walked her into the kitchen, where
</p>
<p>my good woman stood quite dumfounded. 'Sit
</p>
<p>you down there,' I says, putting her into a chair
</p>
<p>at the table. Breakfast hadn't been cleared away,
</p>
<p>as good luck would have it. ' Wife,' says I, ' give
</p>
<p>the girl as good a warm meal as you've got.
</p>
<p>Now you must eat and drink ; you must make out
</p>
<p>a good breakfast,' I says, shaking my head at the
</p>
<p>girl, 'or I shant let you go. If you don't want us
</p>
<p>to look at you, all right : we'll keep away. But
</p>
<p>whatever your errand, you need strength to carry
</p>
<p>it out.' "
</p>
<p>Thomas was listening with impatient eagerness,
</p>
<p>but he could not forbear a word of sincere thanks.
</p>
<p>" Don't mention it," said the farmer. " Who

<p>We begged her to stay and rest, wife and I, but she
</p>
<p>wouldn't hear of it ; and, after thanking us both
</p>
<p>like a lady, she set out Burnside way, and Jim and
</p>
<p>I went over t' the city. Poor girl ! Out of her
</p>
<p>head ? Well, well, tell you what : better get a team
</p>
<p>somewhere. She's far ahead, you know."
</p>
<p>No better advice could be offered or followed.
</p>
<p>In a few moments Thomas was driving the fastest
</p>
<p>horse the village livery stable afforded ; and clouds
</p>
<p>of reddish dust marked his rapid progress eastward.
</p>
<p>He heard of the fugitive twice.
</p>
<p>Once she had stopped to drink at a wayside well,
</p>
<p>and a group of children had watched her as she
</p>
<p>rested a moment and then went on, closely cloaked
</p>
<p>and veiled, though the morning was sultry.
</p>
<p>Once she had stopped at a farmer's door for a
</p>
<p>glass of milk for a sick traveler in the road above,
</p>
<p>she had said, in hurried explanation bringing the
</p>
<p>glass back after a moment with faintly-spoken ye!
</p>
<p>earnest thanks.
</p>
<p>As his horse slackened his pace just as a diffi-
</p>
<p>cult sandy hill was being surmounted, Thomas's
</p>
<p>glance, taking in the broad expanse of landscape,
</p>
<p>brilliant under the rays of the westering sun, caught
</p>
<p>sight of a solitary woman's figure on a slope to the
</p>
<p>left.

<p>The roads crossed just at the summit of the hill ;

<p>and, urging his horse to the utmost, Thomas soon
</p>
<p>140 WRITTEN' IN RED.
</p>
<p>came within view of the figure again ; this time not
</p>
<p>far away.
</p>
<p>Did the unknown journeyer have some premoni-
</p>
<p>tion that she was pursued ? It would seem so, for
</p>
<p>she started like a hunted creature as the sound of
</p>
<p>rapidly-rolling wheels drew nearer, and ran into
</p>
<p>the thick wood that skirted one side of the road as
</p>
<p>if in desperate search of refuge.
</p>
<p>Thomas leaped from his carriage and was at her
</p>
<p>side in an instant. His touch on her shoulder
</p>
<p>seemed to paralyze all power of motion.
</p>
<p>She gave a stifled cry. The long cloak, already
</p>
<p>tangled in the thicket, fell to her feet. With a last
</p>
<p>vain effort to go on, she staggered and reeled.
</p>
<p>As she fell, fainting and worn, in his arms, the
</p>
<p>veil that had concealed her features for so many a
</p>
<p>weary hour became freed from its fastenings and
</p>
<p>drifted away.
</p>
<p>" Good heavens ! " Thomas almost gave way
</p>
<p>himself in the shock of discovery and the following
</p>
<p>revulsion of feeling.

<p>CHAPTER XI.
</p>
<p>IN DANGER.
</p>
<p>"REPORTER THOMAS had no time to con-
</p>
<p>IX. struct theories to account for what had hap-
</p>
<p>pened. For whatever reason, Stella North was the
</p>
<p>woman he had unwittingly followed, and Stella
</p>
<p>North was the woman who now lay in his arms, as
</p>
<p>devoid of life, to all appearances, as the twigs upon
</p>
<p>which her dainty feet were dragging. He looked
</p>
<p>into her face for the moment with helpless irresolu-
</p>
<p>tion. The dictates of common humanity would
</p>
<p>have impelled him to pity her, but it was no ordin-
</p>
<p>ary pity that filled his soul on this occasion. He
</p>
<p>had been aware ever since the day she flashed upon
</p>
<p>him that appealing glance as her sister was leading
</p>
<p>her from the room at Swampscott, of a peculiar
</p>
<p>interest more romantic and tender, perhaps, than
</p>
<p>he as a matter-of-fact man was free to admit to
</p>
<p>himself.
</p>
<p>But the present emergency demanded prompt
</p>
<p>action. He could see plainly enough that it was
</p>
<p>not merely fright that had caused her to lose con-
</p>
<p>sciousness. Nature had bestowed upon her a face
</p>
<p>charming in its natural roundness of outline and
</p>
<p>ready always to break into dimpled smiles ; but,

</p>
<p>alas ! horror and deprivation of sleep and food had
</p>
<p>wrought a wicked change in a few days.
</p>
<p>As she lay with her head thrown back, her lips
</p>
<p>parted, her eyes closed, her hair strayed recklessly
</p>
<p>about her temples, she looked as if she had just
</p>
<p>died after a painful illness. Thomas hastened with
</p>
<p>her out of the sight of possible curiosity. A few
</p>
<p>steps brought him deep enough into a protecting
</p>
<p>wood that fringed the roadside, and here, in the
</p>
<p>leaves beneath the trees where the birds were sing-
</p>
<p>ing, he laid her gently down. His experience in
</p>
<p>the art of restoring fainting women to conscious-
</p>
<p>ness had been extremely limited, but he believed in
</p>
<p>the efficaciousness of alcohol, and always carried
</p>
<p>when traveling for use in an emergency a flask of
</p>
<p>brandy. A little of this strong remedy poured
</p>
<p>down the throat half-strangled the victim, but it
</p>
<p>awoke her. Her eyes opened and she regarded
</p>
<p>him languidly. He had seen a dying bird look just
</p>
<p>that way.
</p>
<p>" Come, Miss North, you feel better now, don't
</p>
<p>you ? " he said awkwardly, as he supported her
</p>
<p>head upon his arm. And then when a sudden
</p>
<p>betrayal of fear and shame surged into her white
</p>
<p>cheeks he hastened to add " There now, there's
</p>
<p>nothing to be afraid of. Not the least in the
</p>
<p>world."
</p>
<p>She made an effort to disengage herself and to
</p>
<p>arise, but she was very weak, and she only sank
</p>
<p>back again with a pathetic sigh. The tears came

<p>into her eyes at once, and she was unable to con-
</p>
<p>IN DANGER. 143
</p>
<p>ceal her weakness or to check it. Faster and faster
</p>
<p>they chased each other down her cheeks. Her
</p>
<p>face was wet with them.
</p>
<p>Thomas watched her with increasing consterna-
</p>
<p>tion. He who had time and again passed, appar-
</p>
<p>ently unmoved, through the most terrible and
</p>
<p>heartrending of scenes, had now to make a great
</p>
<p>effort to retain control of himself. But as a mat-
</p>
<p>ter of fact it is improbable that the girl detected
</p>
<p>any evidences of agitation in his naturally imper-
</p>
<p>turbable countenance.
</p>
<p>" Come, Miss North," he murmured, " this will
</p>
<p>never do. You must not give way like this. Don't
</p>
<p>despair. If there is anything wrong, you may
</p>
<p>depend upon me to help you all I can."
</p>
<p>" Oh, it's not I who need the help," she moaned,
</p>
<p>quite light-headed by reason of her long sufferings ;
</p>
<p>and grasping his sleeve with her little hand she
</p>
<p>exclaimed with sudden, passionate intensit)% " Oh,
</p>
<p>don't let them arrest her. Don't let them hang
</p>
<p>her. Marion never could have done it in her right
</p>
<p>mind. She was out of her head, you know. You
</p>
<p>are sure she was, are you not ? "
</p>
<p>This unexpected entreaty was a surprise, but it
</p>
<p>was a most welcome one to Thomas. He had not
</p>
<p>had an opportunity for deliberate thought since he
</p>
<p>had recognized who it was that had thrown away
</p>
<p>the compromising weapon with the suspicious
</p>
<p>smudge upon it, and fled from the North villa in
</p>
<p>the most damaging of circumstances ; but in a

</p>
<p>vague, general way, his heart had been conscious
</p>
<p>144 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>of the weight of the accepted theory that she was
</p>
<p>in some way implicated in the dark work of the
</p>
<p>tragedy. And now these wild, hysterical words,
</p>
<p>delivered under the pressure of her overstrung
</p>
<p>emotions, gave him more than a hope that she was
</p>
<p>innocent of any part in the hideous crime.
</p>
<p>Innocent ! How could anybody look upon this
</p>
<p>child and doubt her innocence ? Reporter Thomas
</p>
<p>certainly could not, and he gave up trying to, with
</p>
<p>a feverish alacrity that was not entirely charac-
</p>
<p>teristic of him. Comprehending enough of the
</p>
<p>situation to enable him to act intelligently, he
</p>
<p>began at once a long attempt to soothe her. And
</p>
<p>behold another miracle ! This stern man, whose
</p>
<p>stoicism was the wonder of his associates, had sud-
</p>
<p>denly become as patient, as gentle, and as delicate
</p>
<p>as a woman. He smoothed her hair. He wiped
</p>
<p>away her tears. He induced her to take a little
</p>
<p>more of the brandy. By repeatedly assuring her
</p>
<p>that her sister was in no danger, and afterwards
</p>
<p>by turning her attention to other things, he brought
</p>
<p>her once more into a condition of sanity. She was
</p>
<p>not permitted to test her strength upon her feet,
</p>
<p>but she sat up against a tree, and began to regard
</p>
<p>her companion with great, round, wistful eyes, with
</p>
<p>an air of mingled timidity and impulsive confidence.
</p>
<p>" And now, Miss North," said Thomas at last.
</p>
<p>" It is absolutely necessary that I should leave you
</p>
<p>for a few minutes. Will you promise me not to
</p>
<p>stir until I return ? I will be gone just as short a

</p>
<p>" You are so kind," she said faintly. " If it is
</p>
<p>for me, you are going, I hope, really, you wont
</p>
<p>trouble yourself. In a few minutes I shall be
</p>
<p>stronger and can go on."
</p>
<p>" We'll talk about that after I come back," he
</p>
<p>said cheerfully. "And meantime I have your
</p>
<p>promise not to stir ? "
</p>
<p>" Since you are so good, I can refuse you
</p>
<p>nothing," she returned wearily, and closed her
</p>
<p>eyes.
</p>
<p>Thomas was off at an energetic pace. He first
</p>
<p>tied his horse to a tree, and then ran on to the
</p>
<p>nearest farmhouse. A well-to-do-looking woman,
</p>
<p>with a sunny face, appeared at the door in answer
</p>
<p>to his knock.
</p>
<p>" Madam," said Thomas hastily, " I have to
</p>
<p>apologize for my unexpected call, but the fact is,
</p>
<p>I am in great need of food the best you have and
</p>
<p>plenty of it. I'll pay anything. Only let me
</p>
<p>have it at once."
</p>
<p>" But I can't," said the woman ; " I haven't a
</p>
<p>thing in the house to eat ! "
</p>
<p>" But I must have something," exclaimed
</p>
<p>Thomas ; " if it's nothing but milk and water.
</p>
<p>The case is very urgent. Here, do what you can
</p>
<p>for me."
</p>
<p>He thrust a five-dollar bill into the good woman's
</p>
<p>hand. She thrust it back promptly.
</p>
<p>" Here, I don't want your money," she said
</p>
<p>rather stiffly. " Such as I have you're welcome to.

</p>
<p>She led the astonished Thomas into an ample
</p>
<p>pantry, which was in a condition of neatness that
</p>
<p>was almost painful. But it needed no power of
</p>
<p>divination to determine that it was the pride of the
</p>
<p>good woman's life, and the shelves fairly groaned
</p>
<p>with good things. Thomas was dumb with de-
</p>
<p>lighted amazement.
</p>
<p>" Well," said the housewife, evidently enjoying
</p>
<p>the condition of stupefaction to which she had
</p>
<p>reduced him, " do you see anything you'd like ? If
</p>
<p>so, you are welcome."
</p>
<p>" The the fact is," stammered Thomas, " I wish
</p>
<p>you'd let me pay for it. I I you see I might
</p>
<p>carry away a little more than I'd like to ; for the
</p>
<p>fact is I've got a friend just back here in the woods,
</p>
<p>and she he's starving to death."
</p>
<p>The woman laughed outright. Of course, she
</p>
<p>did not believe that anybody was dying for the
</p>
<p>want of food in this land of plenty. The best
</p>
<p>Thomas could do was to effect a compromise.
</p>
<p>The woman accepted "a dollar for the heathen."
</p>
<p>Thomas took away all he could well carry.
</p>
<p>As the reporter approached the place where he
</p>
<p>had left Stella North, he began to have some fears
</p>
<p>that she had deserted him in spite of her promise ;
</p>
<p>but, no. There she was, still sitting against the
</p>
<p>tree, as he had left her. No, not as he had
</p>
<p>left her. Completely exhausted, she had fallen
</p>
<p>asleep.

<p>softly arranged the repast he had secured from the
</p>
<p>IN DANGER. 147
</p>
<p>farmhouse upon a light robe he had taken from the
</p>
<p>carriage. From the bowl of fresh milk to the
</p>
<p>golden-brown custard pie it was genuine and whole-
</p>
<p>some ; and though he would fain have had Young's
</p>
<p>chief cook at his command for an hour or two, still
</p>
<p>he hoped that she could not fail to find the display
</p>
<p>attractive and appetizing.
</p>
<p>But he hesitated to wake her. The poor child
</p>
<p>slept as only one utterly worn out can sleep. He
</p>
<p>looked at her more attentively, and his heart accel-
</p>
<p>erated its pulsations.
</p>
<p>" What a pity," he thought, " that she should be
</p>
<p>so compromisingly mixed up in such an affair as
</p>
<p>this ! Young and charming as she is, if the police
</p>
<p>knew what I know they would not hesitate a min-
</p>
<p>ute to arrest her."
</p>
<p>The thought clouded his brow. He looked at
</p>
<p>his watch. It was getting late. Unless he pro-
</p>
<p>posed to turn her over to the police, in truth, time
</p>
<p>pressed.
</p>
<p>" Ahem ! " he exclaimed. " Miss North ! "
</p>
<p>But her sleep was too deep to be disturbed by
</p>
<p>such an expedient. He placed his hand gently
</p>
<p>upon her shoulder, and a thrill ran through him at
</p>
<p>the contact. She started up and stared wildly
</p>
<p>about her. Gradually the truth came to her. She
</p>
<p>awoke from a happy oblivion to the horror of the
</p>
<p>past few days. The sudden frightened look in her
</p>
<p>face proclaimed this fact. And then her eyes wan-
</p>
<p>dered from the reporter's face to the collation

</p>
<p>" For me ! " she exclaimed. " Oh ! "
</p>
<p>But nothing but tears bespoke her thanks. She
</p>
<p>was evidently ashamed to betray herself so ; but
</p>
<p>she was too weak to prevent it. She covered her
</p>
<p>face with her hands and sank down at the foot of
</p>
<p>the tree.
</p>
<p>" You think me foolish, I know," she stammered.
</p>
<p>" Not a bit of it," said Thomas. " I think your
</p>
<p>nerves are quite unstrung, because you haven't
</p>
<p>taken nourishment enough. Eat something, Miss
</p>
<p>North, I beg of you ; and, my word for it you'll
</p>
<p>feel better."
</p>
<p>By dint of much persuasion and adroit manage-
</p>
<p>ment he reassured her, so that she actually smiled
</p>
<p>the very ghost of a smile, but it betrayed the pres-
</p>
<p>ence of a merry dimple in her cheek, which Thomas
</p>
<p>thought quite charming.
</p>
<p>" How can I thank you ? " she murmured.
</p>
<p>" By eating all you can," he returned.
</p>
<p>And she did endeavor to show her gratitude in
</p>
<p>that way. From time to time she looked at him
</p>
<p>with a glance of dread and apprehension.
</p>
<p>" You are not afraid of me, Miss North, I hope ? "
</p>
<p>he said at last, pleasantly. He was smiling now,
</p>
<p>as he sat on a rock near by watching her eat, which
</p>
<p>she did with that ravenous appetite that comes of
</p>
<p>absolute starvation.
</p>
<p>" Excuse me," she said, after an evident effort,
</p>
<p>" but you are the same gentleman who called at
</p>
<p>our house who used to know my father ? "

<p>"Miss North," he said, "I don't intend to de-
</p>
<p>ceive you. I am a newspaper reporter."
</p>
<p>She uttered a slight scream and dropped her
</p>
<p>knife and fork into her plate. At another time
</p>
<p>Thomas would most certainly have laughed aloud
</p>
<p>at the unmistakable consternation produced by the
</p>
<p>announcement of his profession. As it was, he re-
</p>
<p>pressed his tendency to smile when he saw her lips
</p>
<p>whiten under the cruel apprehension that had
</p>
<p>sprung to life within her.
</p>
<p>" You mistrust me, Miss North," he said, gravely.
</p>
<p>" Oh, no," she returned, in a voice barely audible.
</p>
<p>And added immediately, " For pity's sake, sir, do
</p>
<p>you intend to print what I told you when I was so
</p>
<p>crazy awhile ago ? "
</p>
<p>" Do I, Miss North ? It depends upon whether
</p>
<p>or not you go on with your dinner."
</p>
<p>" Oh, how can you joke about a thing like this ? "
</p>
<p>" Miss North, I am not joking. I never was more
</p>
<p>serious in my life. It is absolutely imperative that
</p>
<p>you eat."
</p>
<p>The poor girl tried to propitiate him by swallow-
</p>
<p>ing a few hasty mouthfuls, but it was evident that
</p>
<p>he had taken her appetite away. She regarded
</p>
<p>him with a look of pathetic appeal.
</p>
<p>" Oh, sir," she exclaimed suddenly, " I am only
</p>
<p>a poor girl, and chance has placed me completely
</p>
<p>at your mercy. Don't torment me, I beseech you.

</p>
<p>And you on your honor, sir ! wont you keep my

<p>secret?"
</p>
<p>" I will do everything I can for your sister for your
</p>
<p>sake," said Thomas. " But I must ask you one ques-
</p>
<p>tion. What reason had you to believe her guilty ?"
</p>
<p>" I do not believe it. No, I will not acknowl-
</p>
<p>edge that I ever really believed it. But for one
</p>
<p>moment when her strange actions seemed unac-
</p>
<p>countable upon any other supposition, I but it
</p>
<p>was a mistake, sir. I am sure of it. She could
</p>
<p>explain everything if she would."
</p>
<p>" There, there ! " said Thomas, soothingly.
</p>
<p>" Don't get excited. You are as safe with me as
</p>
<p>you could possibly be with any one. I simply
</p>
<p>wanted to have the assurance from your lips that
</p>
<p>you are unaware of the fact of any crime."
</p>
<p>" Oh, believe me, sir."
</p>
<p>" I do, Miss North. I believe you implicitly, and
</p>
<p>I will do everything in my power to help you."
</p>
<p>"You are very noble, sir."
</p>
<p>" You flatter me," said Thomas, averting his
</p>
<p>eyes. " I have sisters of my own and "
</p>
<p>The girl clasped her hands.
</p>
<p>" Arid for their sakes "
</p>
<p>" No, for your sake," said Thomas, turning
</p>
<p>quickly to look toward the road.
</p>
<p>" You spoke of that dreadful pistol, sir ! " she
</p>
<p>cried suddenly. " Tell me how you know ! "
</p>
<p>" I saw you, Miss North."

<p>She stretched out her hands impulsively, while a
</p>
<p>wild light of hope lighted in her face.
</p>
<p>" Give it to me," she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>" Forgive me," said Thomas, " but I must re-
</p>
<p>fuse you that. Believe me, it pains me to be obliged
</p>
<p>to refuse you anything."
</p>
<p>You wont give it to me," she faltered. " And
</p>
<p>what, then, do you propose to do with it ? "
</p>
<p>" I will be frank with you now as ever, Miss
</p>
<p>North," he said, in a low voice. " I intend to give
</p>
<p>it to the police."
</p>
<p>She swayed, but his arm prevented her from
</p>
<p>falling.
</p>
<p>" Come ! come ! " he exclaimed, in a quick whis-
</p>
<p>per, as for the moment he held her close to his
</p>
<p>rapidly-beating heart. " Be a woman ! Do your
</p>
<p>duty as I shall do mine ! I have promised you my
</p>
<p>protection my utmost effort on behalf of yourself
</p>
<p>and your sister. Miss North, will you trust me?"
</p>
<p>Impulsively she brought her face very near to
</p>
<p>his and turned the light of her blue eyes full into
</p>
<p>his dark ones. It was an intense, fearful, searching
</p>
<p>stare ; a look such as one might cast into the future
</p>
<p>at a fork in the road of life between lasting happi-
</p>
<p>ness and despair. His gaze never faltered, but hers
</p>
<p>did. She bhished, and suddenly became self-con-
</p>
<p>scious, and precipitately looked down at the ground.
</p>
<p>" I will," she murmured faintly.
</p>
<p>" You are in imminent danger," he said hastily.
</p>
<p>" There is no time to lose. Follow me."

<p>And as he turned from her she obeyed him with

<p>CHAPTER XII.
</p>
<p>THOMAS DECLINES TO STATE THEORIES.
</p>
<p>A BOUT ten o'clock on Monday morning a tele-
</p>
<p>11 phonic message came over the wires from the
</p>
<p>chief of police at Lynn to the Boston police head-
</p>
<p>quarters which seriously interfered with the habitual
</p>
<p>imperturbability of Inspector Applebee.
</p>
<p>"Whatever does this signify ?" he demanded of
</p>
<p>the chief inspector. " That youngest North girl
</p>
<p>has disappeared."
</p>
<p>" No ! " exclaimed his superior, in a tone of sur-
</p>
<p>prise. " How can that be ? "
</p>
<p>" I don't know how it can be ; it is," Applebee
</p>
<p>declared. " She left the house some time last even-
</p>
<p>ing. They did not discover her absence till this
</p>
<p>morning. A hurried search of the neighborhood
</p>
<p>traces her to the railroad station, where she took
</p>
<p>the last train for Boston."
</p>
<p>" That's a queer family, anyhow," commented the
</p>
<p>chief inspector, with a very puzzled air. " Applebee,
</p>
<p>have you tried to ascertain whether there isn't in-
</p>
<p>sanity in the blood ?"
</p>
<p>" Plague take it ! What was I thinking of not to
</p>
<p>have put a man to watch her last night ? I thought
</p>
<p>of it, but it seemed an absurd precaution ! " fumed

<p>the inspector. " However, her flight the minute
</p>
<p>the funeral is over does away with any lingering
</p>
<p>doubt I may have had of her complicity in the
</p>
<p>crime."
</p>
<p>" Better put White on her track at once. Then
</p>
<p>see me and let us have a word or two."
</p>
<p>Inspector White having been despatched to the
</p>
<p>Eastern depot with instructions to find the fugitive
</p>
<p>at any cost, Inspector Applebee returned to the
</p>
<p>private office of his superior. The chief carefully
</p>
<p>closed the door.
</p>
<p>" Applebee," he said, as he resumed his chair,
</p>
<p>" if I understand you definitely, there is nobody, so
</p>
<p>far as known, who benefits a cent by North's death
</p>
<p>except his daughter Stella?"
</p>
<p>" Exactly, inspector. You are to understand
</p>
<p>just that. There is not the slightest indication of
</p>
<p>robbery or theft. Both the property in the house
</p>
<p>and the personal property on North's person were
</p>
<p>intact. Nobody benefits but this girl. Just two
</p>
<p>months ago he took out a ten thousand dollar pol-
</p>
<p>icy in her favor in the Penn Mutual."
</p>
<p>"And are you sure he has effected no other in-
</p>
<p>surance? "
</p>
<p>" I cannot find that he has, or that he ever did."
</p>
<p>" Isn't it rather peculiar that he waited all these
</p>
<p>years and then made her his sole beneficiary in this
</p>
<p>way ? "
</p>
<p>" I don't know. His other daughter is married,
</p>
<p>and he probably considered her amply provided for,

</p>
<p>warned him that it would be prudent to heave over
</p>
<p>an anchor to the windward. But, whatever his
</p>
<p>reason, the fact is indisputable. There it is, in
</p>
<p>black and white. The woman who used the perfume
</p>
<p>I have been looking for is the sole person to profit
</p>
<p>by Paul North's death. It's a curious coincidence,
</p>
<p>to say the least, that the two clues should implicate
</p>
<p>the same person. And yet a seventeen-year-old
</p>
<p>girl like this oh, I can't believe it ; that's all."
</p>
<p>" Applebee," said the chief, " I begin to realize
</p>
<p>that we are in a very delicate position in this matter.
</p>
<p>It calls for our nicest discrimination and judge-
</p>
<p>ment."
</p>
<p>" I should say as much."
</p>
<p>" Let us see what we know. We have established
</p>
<p>circumstantially beyond a reasonable doubt the
</p>
<p>identity of the woman who was in the Marlboro
</p>
<p>Street house at or after the time of North's death ;
</p>
<p>the woman who, to say the least of it, must be an
</p>
<p>accessory after the fact."
</p>
<p>" So, indeed."
</p>
<p>" Instead of some adventuress, the woman turns
</p>
<p>out to be North's own daughter, a mild-faced, inno-
</p>
<p>cent-looking girl of seventeen."
</p>
<p>"So, indeed."
</p>
<p>"Well, now to my mind, unless the girl is crazy
</p>
<p>(and we have no evidence that she is), she never
</p>
<p>could have shot her father."
</p>
<p>" It's a pretty serious thing to charge her with it."
</p>
<p>" You don't believe it ? "

<p>" And as she never could reconcile her conscience
</p>
<p>to such action unless the guilty party were very
</p>
<p>near or very dear to her "
</p>
<p>" Stackhouse again ! " said Applebee signifi-
</p>
<p>cantly. " There's no way out of it. Unless some-
</p>
<p>thing turns up in his favor, I've got to arrest that
</p>
<p>man."
</p>
<p>" It looks so. But I shouldn't like to make a
</p>
<p>mistake."
</p>
<p>" Nor I. It's not like taking some poor beast
</p>
<p>into custody. A mistake like that only redounds
</p>
<p>to our discredit."
</p>
<p>"Very well. Wait a day or two. Something
</p>
<p>more must come out. Let us find this girl. It
</p>
<p>wont take much to frighten her thoroughly. She

<p>will tell us everything she knows. Meanwhile, you

<p>he behaves himself he can do as he pleases. At
</p>
<p>the first cause for suspicion they will bring

<p>There was a knock at the door.

</p>
<p>Mr. Mendell appeared, bearing under his arm a
</p>
<p>small portfolio.
</p>
<p>" Good-morning, gentlemen," was his greeting.
</p>
<p>" And what do you think of the news ? No surprise
</p>
<p>to you, I suppose."
</p>
<p>"What news?" questioned the chief inspector,
</p>
<p>gruffly.
</p>
<p>" Why, the collapse of North & Stackhouse, to
</p>
<p>be sure. What, hadn't you heard ?"
</p>
<p>The two officials were staring at each other.
</p>
<p>" Where did you hear that, Mendell ?" Applebee
</p>
<p>asked.
</p>
<p>"Where? Everywhere. It's all over town. Of
</p>
<p>course circumstances make everybody talk about
</p>
<p>it. All sorts of rumors are afloat as to the cause
</p>
<p>of it. Some say it wouldn't have occurred but for
</p>
<p>North's death. Others say it had to come anyway
</p>
<p>that it was only a matter of time. But, plague
</p>
<p>take it ! that wasn't what I came for."
</p>
<p>" What do they say is the cause of the firm fail-
</p>
<p>ing ? " asked the chief inspector, with every appear-
</p>
<p>ance of intense interest.
</p>
<p>" Well, as I hear it, they've been doing business
</p>
<p>lately chiefly on wind. Oh, it's an awful smash
</p>
<p>up. They say Fetridge, the young millionaire, was
</p>
<p>a considerable loser. In fact, they say all sorts of
</p>
<p>things, as they always do at such times, but I don't
</p>
<p>know how true they are."
</p>
<p>"Who is this Fetridge?" the chief inspector

</p>
<p>" Why, he's the man who came here to get us to
</p>
<p>search the house in Marlboro Street last Thursday.
</p>
<p>A friend of the family, I believe. At any rate, he
</p>
<p>was at the funeral."
</p>
<p>" And what are the rumors, Mendell ? " pursued
</p>
<p>the chief inspector.
</p>
<p>" About Fetridge ? Well, it's reported that he
</p>
<p>held the firm up by the nape of the neck, as it
</p>
<p>were, until North's death, out of regard for the old
</p>
<p>man ; but that Stackhouse tried to see him since
</p>
<p>and got the cold shoulder. They say that Stack-
</p>
<p>house and Fetridge are anything but friends."
</p>
<p>" Quite so," said Applebee. " But, turning from
</p>
<p>gossip to business, what's your report?"
</p>
<p>" Well, gentlemen," returned Mendell, briskly
</p>
<p>opening his portfolio and extracting therefrom sev-
</p>
<p>eral papers, " I don't know that I can help you a
</p>
<p>great deal, but I'm satisfied of one thing. Out of
</p>
<p>all the specimens of writing which Jobson presented
</p>
<p>for my inspection, there are not five which could
</p>
<p>have been done by the party who prepared the
</p>
<p>anonymous letter."
</p>
<p>" There are four then ? " said Applebee.
</p>
<p>" Just," returned Mendell, spreading the samples
</p>
<p>upon the table ; " and there you have them."
</p>
<p>" And how about your preference ? "
</p>
<p>" I have none. You see, the writing of the orig-
</p>
<p>inal is too shaky to be a good guide. It is evi-
</p>
<p>dently a disguised hand, but at the same time not

</p>
<p>it he thought, because it didn't have the general
</p>
<p>appearance, to his eye, of his own writing, it was
</p>
<p>consequently sufficiently blind to deceive anybody.
</p>
<p>I don't believe the peculiarity of the formation of
</p>
<p>the letters ever occurred to the person."
</p>
<p>" Who are these parties ? "
</p>
<p>" Three of them are business men. The fourth
</p>
<p>was formerly a clerk in the firm's employ, but was
</p>
<p>discharged, I believe, for drunkenness."
</p>
<p>" Pshaw ! " said Applebee. " I know these three
</p>
<p>men. They're none of them in need of money, and
</p>
<p>would not have taken that means to get if if they
</p>
<p>had been."
</p>
<p>" It remains, then, with this other fellow Wil-
</p>
<p>lard Smith eh ? " said the chief inspector. "What
</p>
<p>do you know of this man's history ? "
</p>
<p>" Nothingbut the few words that Jobson accident-
</p>
<p>ally let fall," replied the expert. " -He said that
</p>
<p>the man was young and industrious. That he

<p>invested every cent in Nicaragua Midland, lost his

<p>money, and took to rum as a consolation."

<p>positively. " Applebee, let's get to work on this at

<p>once."

<p>There was no time lost. Inspector Applebee

<p>and his assistants were soon scouring the city for

<p>information concerning Mr. Willard Smith, late

<p>Applebee was scarcely awake on Tuesday morn-
</p>
<p>ing when the following telegram was placed in his
</p>
<p>hands:
</p>
<p>" HARTFORD, CONN., 6 A.M.
</p>
<p>" Important ! Meet me at headquarters at n.
</p>
<p>" WHITE."
</p>
<p>" Does he bring Stella North with him ?" was
</p>
<p>the grave question that persisted in Applebee's
</p>
<p>mind during the intervening time. " If so, I am
</p>
<p>confident that we are nearing the end of this
</p>
<p>perplexing case."
</p>
<p>He communicated his anxiety to the chief in-
</p>
<p>spector, and both men waited with impatience the
</p>
<p>coming of the man who had gone in quest of
</p>
<p>the mysterious fugitive. Alas, for their hopes !
</p>
<p>Inspector White was quite alone.
</p>
<p>The three men were closeted together as soon
</p>
<p>as he arrived.

<p>" Not a trace of her ? " exclaimed Applebee im-
</p>
<p>patiently.

<p>White. " Circumstances very peculiar. Whole
</p>
<p>thing mysterious : more than mysterious sus-
</p>
<p>picious."

<p>" How do you mean ? "

<p>White placed his hand impressively on Applebee's
</p>
<p>shoulder, and though the door was shut, spoke in
</p>
<p>almost a whisper :

</p>
<p>" It's likely enough that she had help to escape,"
</p>
<p>observed the chief. " But I know of no good rea-
</p>
<p>son why she should go outside of the State of
</p>
<p>Massachusetts for the purpose of committing
</p>
<p>suicide."
</p>
<p>" Wait till you have heard me," said White eager-
</p>
<p>ly. " Observe the facts carefully. I traced this
</p>
<p>girl to the Albany depot, and through the hack-
</p>
<p>man, who bought her ticket to Hartford, was able
</p>
<p>to go direct to her stopping-place. There I ex-
</p>
<p>pected trouble. Not a bit of it. Everybody knew
</p>
<p>about her. Why ? Well, I'll tell you why. Some-
</p>
<p>body had got ahead of us ; that's all. A black-
</p>
<p>haired young man about thirty years of age, who
</p>
<p>wrote his name William C. Waterston, had been up
</p>
<p>in the morning making inquiries all over the place,
</p>
<p>representing her as insane."
</p>
<p>" Evidently an assumed name," muttered Apple-
</p>
<p>bee apprehensively. " Couldn't you get a full
</p>
<p>description ?"
</p>
<p>"You may be sure I did, even to the cut of his
</p>
<p>shoes. But wait a bit. I haven't got to the end.
</p>
<p>This young man hired a carriage at East Hartford
</p>
<p>and started out upon the road in chase of the girl.
</p>
<p>That he overtook her I have positive evidence.
</p>
<p>That she thereafter disappeared and that he went
</p>
<p>on alone I'm equally well informed."

<p>outwitted."
</p>
<p>" For the time it would seem so."
</p>
<p>" For the time ! " echoed the chief irascibly.
</p>
<p>" Don't you see what this means ! The girl was a
</p>
<p>greenhorn. The man was an expert. I'll bet you
</p>
<p>a hundred dollars he had that girl all the time in
</p>
<p>the bottom of his carriage. Why didn't he go back
</p>
<p>to Hartford ? Can't you see his purpose ? The
</p>
<p>New York and New England Railroad runs
</p>
<p>through Vernon. By this time both principal
</p>
<p>and accomplice are safe in the city of New
</p>
<p>York."
</p>
<p>The two assistants stared blankly.
</p>
<p>" At any rate," said Applebee, "it plainly demon-
</p>
<p>strates one thing. We're dealing with profes-
</p>
<p>sionals."
</p>
<p>" Professional what ? " asked the chief angrily.
</p>
<p>" What is there in the line of a professional about
</p>
<p>this affair ? Was there any theft, any property
</p>
<p>missing ? This isn't a burglary, my friend ; it's a
</p>
<p>murder."
</p>
<p>" So, indeed," said Applebee. " But profes-

<p>sionals have been hired before now to do a job of
</p>
<p>THOMAS DECLINES TO STATE THEORIES. 163
</p>
<p>that kind. It's no use for you to tell me that this
</p>
<p>chap doesn't know the ropes, inspector."
</p>
<p>The chief seemed struck by his remark, and be-
</p>
<p>came thoughtful.
</p>
<p>" Write out the fullest possible description of the
</p>
<p>man," he said to White. " We'll see what we can
</p>
<p>do ; though I'm afraid we've botched it."
</p>
<p>Inspector White took out his notes, and, seating
</p>
<p>himself at the table, began immediately to comply
</p>
<p>with the request. In the midst of the work a mes-
</p>
<p>senger ventured to bring a card to the door.
</p>
<p>" Humph," said the chief, " Kingman F. Thomas,
</p>
<p>of the Boston Globe, is here, and he says that his
</p>
<p>business is important and immediate."
</p>
<p>" Let him come in, then," advised Applebee. " I
</p>
<p>tell you that man cut his eye-teeth years ago. If
</p>
<p>he says important he means important."
</p>
<p>The chief gave a sign of acquiescence, and
</p>
<p>shortly after the door opened to admit Mr. King-
</p>
<p>man F. Thomas. Quietly dignified, and entirely
</p>
<p>master of himself, as upon all occasions, the re-
</p>
<p>porter cast a quick glance upon the group. With-
</p>
<p>out a word he advanced to the table, inserted his
</p>
<p>hand in his breast, took therefrom something en-
</p>
<p>wrapped in a newspaper, and laid it down before
</p>
<p>the chief inspector.
</p>
<p>" What is it, Thomas ? " queried Applebee curi-
</p>
<p>ously.
</p>
<p>" Look at it," returned the reporter briefly.
</p>
<p>The chief undid the wrapping and took out an

</p>
<p>loading pistol, about eight inches in length, and
</p>
<p>stained with rust in several places.
</p>
<p>Everybody started and looked eagerly from the
</p>
<p>weapon to the serious face of the man who had
</p>
<p>brought it.
</p>
<p>"It is just as I found it," he said quietly,
</p>
<p>" with the exception of the rust. I took it out
</p>
<p>of the water, and I didn't care to wipe it much,
</p>
<p>for fear of destroying the smut on that empty
</p>
<p>barrel."
</p>
<p>" Well," said the chief, with an assumption of
</p>
<p>indifference, " why do you bring it here ? "
</p>
<p>" I considered it my duty to do so, sir."
</p>
<p>" To be sure ; but what makes you think so ?
</p>
<p>In other words, where did you find it ? "
</p>
<p>" I found it in the water on the shore at Swamp-
</p>
<p>scott."
</p>
<p>"Swampscott ! " ejaculated Applebee, who began
</p>
<p>to examine the weapon with avidity. " The deuce
</p>
<p>you did ! When ? "
</p>
<p>" Sunday night, about nine o'clock."
</p>
<p>" Sunday ! " echoed the chief inspector sharply,
</p>
<p>" and it is now Tuesday morning. You were evi-
</p>
<p>dently in no haste."
</p>
<p>" I went out of town by a very early train on
</p>
<p>Monday. This is the first opportunity I have had,
</p>
<p>gentlemen."
</p>
<p>" How came you to be wading in the water at
</p>
<p>Swampscott after dark, Thomas?" questioned
</p>
<p>Applebee.

</p>
<p>u Well, sir, it wont take me long to tell you what
</p>
<p>THOMAS DECLINES TO STATE THEORIES. 165
</p>
<p>little I know about the matter. I stipulate but one
</p>
<p>thing. This must not be given to the press. You
</p>
<p>agree ? Very well. I was passing the North villa
</p>
<p>when I saw a woman enveloped in a long cloak
</p>
<p>stealing out of the garden. I followed her, deem-
</p>
<p>ing her appearance suspicious. She went toward
</p>
<p>the shore, and I thought I saw her throw something
</p>
<p>into the water. Waiting till she had gone, I waded
</p>
<p>out and found this. I ran up the street, hoping to
</p>
<p>catch her, but missed the last train in. She seems
</p>
<p>to have been in better luck."
</p>
<p>The three inspectors exchanged significant
</p>
<p>glances.
</p>
<p>" And you didn't see her face, Thomas ? " Apple-
</p>
<p>bee eagerly inquired.
</p>
<p>" I did not ; no."
</p>
<p>" And you have no idea who she is ? "
</p>
<p>Thomas hesitated a moment before replying.
</p>
<p>" I don't know that I care to state theories. You
</p>
<p>have enough of your own."
</p>
<p>" Well, Mr. Thomas," said the chief at last, " I
</p>
<p>think you are entitled to our most sincere thanks
</p>
<p>for important evidence in the North case. Still, in
</p>
<p>matters of this kind delays are dangerous. It does
</p>
<p>seem as if you might have found some way to get
</p>
<p>this to us before this."
</p>
<p>" I preferred to deliver it in person," said
</p>
<p>Thomas quietly. " I never take any chances in a
</p>
<p>matter of this importance."
</p>
<p>" You prefer to be slow but sure, I suppose,"

</p>
<p>said the chief, smiling. " Well, Applebee, here it
</p>
<p>1 66 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>%
</p>
<p>is. It wont take you long to verify your suspicions
</p>
<p>about it."
</p>
<p>" I rather suspect that Thomas has already done
</p>
<p>that," Applebee said.
</p>
<p>" I took that liberty, yes," agreed the reporter.
</p>
<p>" To whom did you take it ? "
</p>
<p>" To Comfort Harwood, Swampscott."
</p>
<p>" When ? "
</p>
<p>" This morning the only opportunity I have
</p>
<p>had."
</p>
<p>" And what did she say ? "
</p>
<p>" She positively identified it as the property of
</p>
<p>the late Paul North."
</p>
<p>This appeared to be the extent of Thomas's
</p>
<p>information. When he went out, White said with
</p>
<p>a smile :
</p>
<p>" Bless me if that man wouldn't stand as a model
</p>
<p>for this description I am writing."
</p>
<p>" Eh ! " exclaimed the chief inspector, turning
</p>
<p>suddenly in his chair. " Applebee, watch that
</p>
<p>man ! "
</p>
<p>" What ? Thomas ? " cried the subordinate, in
</p>
<p>amused amazement.
</p>
<p>" That same Thomas," said the chief dryly ;
</p>
<p>" unless you want the newspapers to get ahead
</p>
<p>of us in this matter. For I tell you that man knows

<p>more than he has told us."
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIII.
</p>
<p>STILL THE MOISSOT WOMAN.
</p>
<p>EARLY in the morning of the Monday, when
</p>
<p>Thomas was on his way to Hartford, Detective
</p>
<p>Lamm unlocked his office door. Almost the first
</p>
<p>object to catch his eye as he entered the room was
</p>
<p>a folded note lying upon the floor.
</p>
<p>" Am called out of town on an important clue," ran the brief
</p>
<p>lead-pencil message. " Will see you as soon as I get back.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, look out for developments at Swampscott.
</p>
<p>" TH."
</p>
<p>John Lamm was puzzled and curious, but, as he
</p>
<p>had already taken the additional precaution to put
</p>
<p>both Moffett and an intimate friend of the butler,
</p>
<p>the parlor-maid at the North villa, upon his salary
</p>
<p>list, and was reasonably confident that they meant
</p>
<p>to serve him faithfully, he was not particularly
</p>
<p>anxious.
</p>
<p>He opened his desk, ran through the letters that
</p>
<p>had come, and then sat back in his chair to hastily
</p>
<p>peruse the morning Boston Globe.
</p>
<p>" Not a thing new in the case," he mentally com-
</p>
<p>mented. " What a lot of words that man Thomas
</p>
<p>can string together about nothing, and yet leave
</p>
<p>the impression on our minds that we have really

</p>
<p>been reading something important! Evidently he
</p>
<p>didn't think his clue ripe enough to give it to the
</p>
<p>public."
</p>
<p>He turned the paper over carelessly. Suddenly
</p>
<p>he started and clutched the newspaper with a
</p>
<p>nervous grasp.
</p>
<p>" Hullo! Hullo! " he exclaimed aloud. " What
</p>
<p>the deuce does this mean ? "
</p>
<p>For there, staring him in the face, was this:
</p>
<p>" "1TTANTED. Information concerning the whereabouts of
</p>
<p>Marie Moissot, formerly of New Orleans, recently of
</p>
<p>New York ; Creole extraction ; 27 years of age. Large
</p>
<p>reward will be paid for reliable information, if sent immedi-
</p>
<p>ately. Address, D. 196, Boston Globe office."
</p>
<p>" Well, this is a coincidence," Mr. Lamm re-
</p>
<p>flected. " The same day that my advertisement to
</p>
<p>the same effect appears in New York, the advertise-
</p>
<p>ment of some other party appears in Boston. Now,
</p>
<p>who is it? "
</p>
<p>A prolonged reflection, leaning back in his chair
</p>
<p>under the stimulation of a fresh cigar, was unpro-
</p>
<p>ductive of a satisfactory answer to the detective's
</p>
<p>query. But the reverie ended in active measures.
</p>
<p>He suddenly arose, closed his desk, locked the
</p>
<p>office, and went out. Bending his steps in the di-
</p>
<p>rection of the Boston Globe office, he was soon con-
</p>
<p>versing with one of the clerks, but the result was
</p>
<p>not propitious.
</p>
<p>" Oh, we don't pretend to know who puts in any
</p>
<p>of these ' wants,' " the clerk said. " There are too

</p>
<p>many of them. We know these advertisers only
</p>
<p>STILL THE MOISSOT WOMAN. 169
</p>
<p>by the tickets. When a man puts in a want, we
</p>
<p>give him a ticket, dated and numbered with a stamp.
</p>
<p>That ticket is good for mail for ten days from the
</p>
<p>date of it."
</p>
<p>" Did you take this ' ad ' yourself ? "
</p>
<p>" Haven't a doubt of it ; but I took no note of
</p>
<p>the person who presented it. Couldn't even say
</p>
<p>\yhether it was a man or a woman."
</p>
<p>The detective returned to his office and began
</p>
<p>a search for suitable writing material. He was not
</p>
<p>long in finding what he wanted, for his desk was
</p>
<p>amply provided with stationery adapted for all pos-
</p>
<p>sible contingencies. Selecting a modest envelope,
</p>
<p>notepaper of a poor quality, a fine pen, and a bottle
</p>
<p>of pale ink, he took infinite pains to produce the
</p>
<p>following :
</p>
<p>" D. 196, ' BOSTON GLOBE ' OFFICE,
</p>
<p>" In answer to advertisement of this A.M., would say I have
</p>
<p>information that may be useful. If you care to see me, will be
</p>
<p>at corner of Shawmut Avenue and Dwight Street at 7 P.M.
</p>
<p>Look for lady with red cherries on her bonnet.
</p>
<p>" CONFIDENTIAL."
</p>
<p>Examining with a critical eye this effusion, John
</p>
<p>Lamm became convinced that he could not better
</p>
<p>it, sealed it, and hastened to the post office with it.
</p>
<p>On his return he found one of his assistants in the
</p>
<p>office.
</p>
<p>" You know where this lady lives in Shawmut
</p>
<p>Avenue ?" he said, presenting a name on a bit of

<p>paper. " Weil, get down there before she gets
</p>
<p>1 70 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>away, and tell her that I must see her at once on
</p>
<p>important business."
</p>
<p>The man departed, leaving John Lamm in sole
</p>
<p>possession of the office.
</p>
<p>Eleven o'clock brought him news of the failure
</p>
<p>of North and Stackhouse, news which he received
</p>
<p>with admirable imperturbability.
</p>
<p>" And how much do they fail for? " he asked his
</p>
<p>informant.
</p>
<p>"Everything, I hear. Even North's personal
</p>
<p>property is likely to go. His town house and his
</p>
<p>house at Swampscott."
</p>
<p><l And in that case, how much of an inheritance
</p>
<p>does he leave his daughters ? "
</p>
<p>" Ah, poor things ! Nothing ! "
</p>
<p>" So, so," said John Lamm to himself, after his
</p>
<p>informant had departed. " That's how the wind
</p>
<p>blows, does it ! Well, it remains for me to find out
</p>
<p>who profits by North's death, and who by the
</p>
<p>failure. Certainly it is neither Marion Stackhouse
</p>
<p>nor Stella North."
</p>
<p>The detective was not aware of Paul North's
</p>
<p>little transaction in life insurance, and it is not pro-
</p>
<p>bable that it would have made much difference in
</p>
<p>his opinion if he had been.
</p>
<p>But John Lamm's attention was now taken
</p>
<p>by the arrival of his assistant in company with a
</p>
<p>keen-eyed woman about five-and-thirty, modestly
</p>
<p>dressed.
</p>
<p>" Ah, Miss Dallison ! Good-morning," said the

<p>detective cordially. " Are you engaged to-day ? "
</p>
<p>STILL THE MOISSOT WOMAN. I? I
</p>
<p>" Some things on hand," she said, in a brisk,
</p>
<p>business-like way ; " but if it's important "
</p>
<p>Lamm waved his hand toward the door of his
</p>
<p>inner office, and the lady preceded him into the
</p>
<p>small retiring room which the detective preserved
</p>
<p>for his most important conferences.
</p>
<p>" And now, Bill," said Lamm, turning to his
</p>
<p>assistant, and speaking in a low tone, " I want you
</p>
<p>to go to Swampscott. You know where the North
</p>
<p>villa is. You will easily find it without any obtru-
</p>
<p>sive inquiries, you understand. At the upper right-
</p>
<p>hand corner, at the part of the house away from
</p>
<p>the water, is a square tower with green blinds. If
</p>
<p>a small white handkerchief is placed over the sill
</p>
<p>go to the servants' door and deliver an express
</p>
<p>package to Mollie White. Take that receipt along
</p>
<p>v:ith you and have her sign for it. She will leave
</p>
<p>what she has for me in the book. See ? If there
</p>
<p>is no signal by four o'clock, you may come back."
</p>
<p>When Detective Lamm had despatched his as-
</p>
<p>sistant, he locked the door and saluted his female
</p>
<p>caller over again.
</p>
<p>" Allow me to pay my respects to the only female
</p>
<p>detective in America who is worth her bread and
</p>
<p>butter," he said. " How are you ? "
</p>
<p>" Is it because I'm so good or the rest are so
</p>
<p>poor, Mr. Lamm ? " she returned. " Or because
</p>
<p>there isn't much money in your case, and you want
</p>
<p>me to work cheap ? Or what ? "
</p>
<p>" No, Miss Dallison, I don't want you to work

</p>
<p>cheap," replied Lamm, becoming serious and draw-
</p>
<p>1 72 WRITTEN IN RED,
</p>
<p>ing up a chair near to her. " If you can do what
</p>
<p>I want I shall willingly let you put your own price
</p>
<p>on it."
</p>
<p>" Well, what is it ? "
</p>
<p>" I can't say yet just what it will be. I have
</p>
<p>taken the liberty to make an appointment at your
</p>
<p>house with a party unknown at seven this evening.
</p>
<p>If the party puts in an appearance, you will have
</p>
<p>the simple task of finding out all he or she knows,
</p>
<p>while pretending to give him or her some informa-
</p>
<p>tion which you do not possess."
</p>
<p>" Really," said Miss Dallison, sarcastically, " it
</p>
<p>is very simple indeed."
</p>
<p>" Unfortunately," said Lamm, "there is no other
</p>
<p>way that I can see to get the information necessary.
</p>
<p>I will tell you how the case stands." And produc-
</p>
<p>ing the copy of the Boston Globe, the detective pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to explain his plans. " You see," he said,
</p>
<p>in conclusion, " I merely desire to have you per-
</p>
<p>sonate the writer of the letter I wrote this morning,
</p>
<p>and to draw out as much as possible about the
</p>
<p>purpose of publishing that advertisement from the
</p>
<p>person who turns up in answer to my note. There
</p>
<p>are two things I wish to find out the first is, who
</p>
<p>inserted the ' ad,' and the second is, what is wanted
</p>
<p>of Marie Moissot. And, incidentally, if I can find
</p>
<p>out who this Marie Moissot is, why so much the
</p>
<p>better."
</p>
<p>Miss Dallison was exceedingly dubious about the
</p>
<p>result, but as she was willing to try, after arrang-

</p>
<p>ing the matter more in detail, Lamm made an
</p>
<p>STILL THE MOISSOT WOMAN. 173
</p>
<p>appointment at her house for seven o'clock, and
</p>
<p>bade her " good-morning."
</p>
<p>" Good heavens ! " muttered Lamm to himself,
</p>
<p>when he was alone, " this is the first time I ever
</p>
<p>was employed in a case where I was obliged to go
</p>
<p>to such trouble to find out a few facts which the
</p>
<p>man who employed me could give me in five min-
</p>
<p>utes, if he only would. Is it because he doesn't
</p>
<p>care to, or because he doesn't dare to ? I'll find
</p>
<p>out, or my name isn't Lamm. I always like to
</p>
<p>know what sort of a man I'm working for. It's
</p>
<p>convenient sometimes."
</p>
<p>With these reflections, Mr. Lamm betook him-
</p>
<p>self to other matters connected with his puzzling
</p>
<p>and thus far unsatisfactory quest, for he really
</p>
<p>hadn't got far enough along to be able to form a
</p>
<p>theory that positively seemed reasonable to him.
</p>
<p>His assistant returned during the afternoon.
</p>
<p>" The white rag was out when I got there," he
</p>
<p>said. " So I went to the house at once and re-
</p>
<p>turned by the next train."
</p>
<p>He handed Mr. Lamm a message sealed in an
</p>
<p>envelope, which (relieved of the peculiarities of its
</p>
<p>orthography) contained information as follows :
</p>
<p>" Stella North has run away. Her bed was not slept in
</p>
<p>last night. Miss Harwood had to force open the door. When
</p>

<p>Stackhouse attended her. She was very pale, but did not say
</p>
<p>anything. Moffett said she had a ' distracted ' look about the
</p>
<p>eyes, but I couldn't see her different than usual. As soon as
</p>
<p>Miss Harwood came to, Miss Marion (she has forbid any of

<p>us to call her Mrs. ), sent Moffett to Mr. Fetridge's house.
</p>
<p>174 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>He came over right away. They had a long talk, which I did
</p>
<p>not hear. Then Mr. Fetridge took Moffett away with him to
</p>
<p>look for Stella. Since then Miss Marion has been in her room
</p>
<p>walking up and down. I don't believe she has sat down once.
</p>
<p>Just keeps walking all the time. She must have walked six
</p>
<p>miles. Moffett says that Mr. Fetridge sent him to the police
</p>
<p>office, but he didn't go himself. Nobody knew when Miss
</p>
<p>Stella went out. She went up to bed very early, and we
</p>
<p>thought she was locked in her room to cry. I hope this will
</p>
<p>be of service to find her, as nobody could wish her any harm."
</p>
<p>"P. S. She is very different from her sister."
</p>
<p>"Ah! that woman is a rough diamond," mur-
</p>
<p>mured Mr. Lamm, as he conveyed the letter to his
</p>
<p>capacious pocket-book. " A professional couldn't
</p>
<p>have done much better ! "
</p>
<p>" But in the name of wonders," his thought con-
</p>
<p>tinued, " what does it all mean ? If it had been
</p>
<p>Marion I might have understood it but this sev-
</p>
<p>enteen-year-old baby ! There is some salient
</p>
<p>feature in this case that I haven't yet come across.
</p>
<p>Now, what is it ? Where shall I look for the miss-
</p>
<p>ing link ?"
</p>
<p>Profoundly abstracted and reserved, John Lamm
</p>
<p>continued to be throughout the remainder of the
</p>
<p>day. All the way to the house on Shawmut
</p>
<p>Avenue, whither he betook himself rather in ad-
</p>
<p>vance of the appointed time, he was not in a con-
</p>
<p>dition to recognize acquaintances or know of what
</p>
<p>sort the weather was. His mind was wholly ab-
</p>
<p>sorbed with the knotty problem that the North
</p>
<p>case now presented. The latest development in it

</p>
<p>had aroused a new train of suspicions.
</p>
<p>STILL THE MOISSOT WOMAN. 175
</p>
<p>Once inside the modest rooms of the woman de-
</p>
<p>tective, however, Lamm threw off the burden of
</p>
<p>speculation and devoted all his energies to his im-
</p>
<p>mediate purpose. The windows of Miss Dallison's
</p>
<p>front chamber (her suite was on the second floor)
</p>
<p>overlooked the corner to which Lamm's letter of
</p>
<p>the morning was designed to lure the author of the
</p>
<p>mysterious want " ad." The detective reasoned
</p>
<p>that if the advertiser was as importunate as he ap-
</p>
<p>peared to be, he would surely call for answers
</p>
<p>before night, and unless there was some more tan-
</p>
<p>gible reply from another quarter, the decoy was
</p>
<p>sure to bring him. And he was quite right. Miss
</p>
<p>Dallison was already arrayed in the bonnet with
</p>
<p>the red cherries, and stock at his side looking with
</p>
<p>him between the half-closed blinds toward the
</p>
<p>opposite corner when the clocks struck seven.
</p>
<p>" Thornton Stackhouse, as I live ! " exclaimed
</p>
<p>Lamm a moment later, " and prompt to the minute !
</p>
<p>There is your man," he said quickly, pointing him
</p>
<p>out. " Bring him here. I will be in the next room
</p>
<p>as arranged. If he asks you any questions, wait a
</p>
<p>bit before answering. If the feather sways twice,
</p>
<p>it means say ' yes '; if once, it means ' no." If not
</p>
<p>at all, you are left to your own discretion. You
</p>
<p>generally will be."
</p>
<p>John Lamm referred to a large peacock's feather
</p>
<p>ornamentally arranged over a book-case. He had
</p>
<p>connected it with the adjoining room by a bit of
</p>
<p>silk thread.

</p>
<p>A very few minutes thereafter Miss Dallison and
</p>
<p>176 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>Thornton Stackhouse entered the front chamber.
</p>
<p>The man took the seat offered to him, back to the
</p>
<p>book-case. If Miss Dallison had been familiar with
</p>
<p>his personal appearance, she could not have helped
</p>
<p>observing that the lines of care in his face had deep-
</p>
<p>ened heavily since the day of his partner's death.
</p>
<p>He had the sleepiness, worn expression of an anx-
</p>
<p>ious watcher by the bedside of a serious illness.
</p>
<p>" Well, well, woman," he said abruptly, in no
</p>
<p>very conciliatory tones, " I trust after bringing me
</p>
<p>here you don't disappoint me. What do you know
</p>
<p>of this Marie Moissot ? Speak quickly, for my
</p>
<p>engagements are pressing."
</p>
<p>" Well, now, my dear sir," began Miss Dallison
</p>
<p>in a nervous, high-keyed manner, very unlike her
</p>
<p>natural self, "you'd better understand me, to begin
</p>
<p>with. I'm not going to betray any confidences that
</p>
<p>I may have made with any of them as I may be
</p>
<p>pardoned for calling friends without I know the
</p>
<p>why and the wherefores of it."
</p>
<p>" What do you mean ? " asked Stackhouse
</p>
<p>darkly. " Do you expect me to tell you my busi-
</p>
<p>ness with her before I know anything about you ?
</p>
<p>You must think me a fool. I offered a reward for
</p>
<p>information, and came here to get it ; not to give it."
</p>
<p>"Very well, indeed, sir, so you did," returned
</p>
<p>Miss Dallison with a very shrewd air of suspicion.
</p>
<p>"But you have to satisfy me that you don't mean
</p>
<p>no harm to a body, for I'll not speak a word to
</p>
<p>injure any friend of mine. So that's just what you

</p>
<p>and I have got to settle before we go ahead."
</p>
<p>STILL THE MOISSOT WOMAN. 1 77
</p>
<p>" Well, in the first place," said Stackhouse,
</p>
<p>changing his tactics, " suppose we settle whether
</p>
<p>you have any information about the person that I
</p>
<p>want. Describe the woman you refer to ? "
</p>
<p>" Oh, sir ! I'm no good that way. She was
</p>
<p>about twenty-seven, dark, quite dark well, medium
</p>
<p>height, I should say and what I call reasonably
</p>
<p>good-looking."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! and what is she doing for a living ?"
</p>
<p>" Oh, there's where I can't answer, you see, until
</p>
<p>I find out why you want to know."
</p>
<p>Stackhouse made an impatient gesture.
</p>
<p>" Has this woman you speak of been in Boston
</p>
<p>lately ? "
</p>
<p>The feather swayed twice.
</p>
<p>" I see no harm in saying ' Yes ' to that, sir. No
</p>
<p>harm. But more I wont say. You see, sir, cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances are peculiar. She confided me that
</p>
<p>circumstances are peculiar."
</p>
<p>" You mean to say, don't you, that she was here
</p>
<p>for private purposes, and that she wanted her
</p>
<p>presence here kept a secret ? "
</p>
<p>" I shouldn't wonder."
</p>
<p>" Have you known this woman long ? "
</p>
<p>The feather swayed twice.
</p>
<p>" A good many years, sir."
</p>
<p>"And under that name all the time? "
</p>
<p>"I decline to state what names she has gone
</p>
<p>under," said the woman, with considerable asperity.

<p>out of a poor woman as has herself to look after.
</p>
<p>I know fast enough I know the woman you want.
</p>
<p>I knew it the minute I read that in the paper.
</p>
<p>But I aint going to be caught in no trap, nor I aint
</p>
<p>going to get into no trouble. So there's how the
</p>
<p>land lays, and you may as well know it first as last."
</p>
<p>Stackhouse seemed to be sitting on pins and
</p>
<p>needles.
</p>
<p>" Hang it ! " he cried. " Don't be a fool ! I
</p>
<p>have no wish to harm her, nor you either. I only
</p>
<p>wish to see her ; that's all to talk with her."
</p>
<p>"Well?"
</p>
<p>" Is she in Boston ? "
</p>
<p>" That I decline to say, sir."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! " said Stackhouse, coming to his feet. " I
</p>
<p>see she is, or you wouldn't be so cunning about it.
</p>
<p>Now, where is she ? In this house ? Tell the
</p>
<p>truth. Didn't she herself send you to answer that
</p>
<p>advertisement ? As a matter of fact, isn't she lis-
</p>
<p>tening to this very conversation ? "
</p>
<p>He made a sudden movement toward the half-
</p>
<p>open door behind which Lamm stood. But the
</p>
<p>woman was quicker than he was, and she inter-
</p>
<p>cepted him.
</p>
<p>" Don't you dare, sir ! " she cried, standing with
</p>
<p>her back against the door. " She may be and she
</p>
<p>may not be ; but if you attempt to go into that
</p>
<p>room, I'll scream for help."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! " said Stackhouse significantly, " as I
</p>
<p>thought. You are too smart, woman. You have

<p>betrayed yourself."
</p>
<p>STILL THE MOISSOT WOMAN. 1 79
</p>
<p>" Well, then," said the woman doggedly, " you
</p>
<p>can't see her ; that's all."
</p>
<p>" Oh ; that's what she told you to say, is it ?"
</p>
<p>" Never mind. You can't see her. If you've
</p>
<p>got any message for her, write it, and I'll see that
</p>
<p>she gets it, and she will reply by mail. You can't
</p>
<p>see her. You ought to be ashamed to try to, after
</p>
<p>treating her as you have." This sole real bit of
</p>
<p>information which Miss Dallison possessed outside
</p>
<p>of the patent facts of the advertisement, delivered
</p>
<p>at this opportune time, must have dissipated any
</p>
<p>doubts still lingering in Stackhouse's mind.
</p>
<p>" Very well," he said, in an altered tone, " I will
</p>
<p>write to her." He turned toward the outer door,
</p>
<p>and Miss Dallison followed him. He had actually
</p>
<p>opened the door to pass into the entry, and she was
</p>
<p>quite off her guard, when, with a quick spring, he
</p>
<p>leaped back into the room, thrusting her aside, and
</p>
<p>before she could prevent him, had flung wide open
</p>
<p>the door to the adjoining chamber.
</p>
<p>But John Lamm was too old a bird to be caught
</p>
<p>in any such trap. At the first intimation of Stack-
</p>
<p>house's suspicion he had taken his departure.

</p>
<p>MR. LAMM COUGHS BEHIND HIS HAND.
</p>
<p>" CLIPPED through your fingers again, didn't
</p>
<p>O she ?"
</p>
<p>If the mocking face of Miss Dallison could be
</p>
<p>depended upon, that business-like woman seemed
</p>
<p>to enjoy the discomfiture and anger of her victim
</p>
<p>very keenly. She took up her hat, shook the dust
</p>
<p>from the deceiving cherries, poised it a moment in
</p>
<p>her hand, and then said
</p>
<p>" Well ? "
</p>
<p>Mr. Stackhouse acknowledged his defeat with a
</p>
<p>very grim sort of smile.
</p>
<p>" You're a clever pair, you two," he said shortly.
</p>
<p>" Where's paper and ink ? Have you got such
</p>
<p>things in this pantomime-trap of a house ? " look-
</p>
<p>ing with a scowl round the room he had found
</p>
<p>empty.
</p>
<p>" Ah ! I thought you'd turn sensible after
</p>
<p>a while," rejoined Miss Dallison, briskly producing
</p>
<p>writing materials from the caverns of what a casual
</p>
<p>visitor would have pronounced a wardrobe, but
</p>
<p>which was much more a very arsenal of belong-
</p>
<p>ings, some curious for their oddity, some common-
</p>
<p>place enough, but all designed for instant use, when
</p>
<p>wanted by this extremely wide-awake woman.

</p>
<p>MR. LAMM COUGHS BEHIND HIS HAND. iSl
</p>
<p>Mr. Stackhouse did not find the flow of ideas
</p>
<p>quite to his liking. He began and tore up two let-
</p>
<p>ters, carefully bestowing the fragments in his watch
</p>
<p>pocket. Finally he seemed to find an inspiration,
</p>
<p>and his pen went rapidly over the paper, while Miss
</p>
<p>Dallison perused the pages of the morning's 2fafta*
</p>
<p>Globe with every appearance of lively interest.
</p>
<p>" There ! " the visitor said at last, tossing his pen
</p>
<p>aside and sealing up the letter. " Give that to
</p>
<p>Marie Moissot, and mind you tell her before she
</p>
<p>opens it that she will do well to keep it entirely to
</p>
<p>herself."
</p>
<p>" The lady knows what she is about," was Miss
</p>
<p>Dallison's response.
</p>
<p>" I hope she does," was Mr. Stackhouse's re-
</p>
<p>joinder, as he took his hat, and, without any cere-
</p>
<p>monious words of adieu, proceeded down town.
</p>
<p>Wherever he went or whatever " surcease from
</p>
<p>care " he may have sought in any quarter, one
</p>
<p>thing is certain he did not make immediate claim
</p>
<p>upon the attention of Detective Lamm.
</p>
<p>But shortly after his departure, that busy gentle-
</p>
<p>man had the satisfaction of rejoining the triumphant
</p>
<p>Miss Dallison and of reading the following enigma-
</p>
<p>tical epistle :
</p>
<p>" MARIE : Your part in the conspiracy to bring about my
</p>
<p>ruin, which was carried out on the I7th of this present June,
</p>

</p>
<p>with suspicion. My hopes of fortune are destroyed. Let me

</p>
<p>1 82 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>to give a vanquished man : and whatever I can save from the
</p>
<p>wreck of North & Stackhouse shall be yours. I have not
</p>
<p>forgotten the old days at Lake Pontchartrain. I am aware
</p>
<p>that I am not entitled to ask for mercy. But by the same
</p>
<p>means that you have done the mischief you can undo it. Will
</p>
<p>you not ? The reward will be enough to satisfy your con-
</p>
<p>science. I cannot speak more definitely upon paper. I must
</p>
<p>see you in person, and have a talk with you about this. Even
</p>
<p>if you refuse meet me face to face, You do not know how
</p>
<p>much I may say to you.
</p>
<p>"T. S."
</p>
<p>Detective Lamm was still puzzling in a highly-
</p>
<p>excited frame of mind over this letter, when Tues-
</p>
<p>day afternoon came.
</p>
<p>" I wish I had Thomas here to talk it over," was
</p>
<p>his unspoken thought as he gave his office chair a
</p>
<p>twirl. " Where is the man all this while? " he said
</p>
<p>aloud.
</p>
<p>Hardly were the words out of his mouth when a
</p>
<p>well-known knock was heard. Lamm's face bright-
</p>
<p>ened, and brightened still more when he admitted
</p>
<p>to his little room of counsel a moment later Mr.
</p>
<p>Kingman F. Thomas.
</p>
<p>" Why, Kingman, where have you kept yourself
</p>
<p>all this while ? Sit down, sit down, and give an ac-
</p>
<p>count of yourself."
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas parried this impetuous salutation
</p>
<p>and query with a question of his own.
</p>
<p>"An account of myself ? " he said, laughing.
</p>
<p>" Perhaps you think my time's my own. Did you
</p>
<p>never hear of such a thing as a journalist being
</p>
<p>sent out of town to do a given bit of work for his

</p>
<p>MR. LAMM COUGHS BEHIND HIS HAND. 183
</p>
<p>The detective nodded his head and looked at
</p>
<p>Thomas in a quizzical sort of a way.
</p>
<p>" Oh, yes, Kingman. But they don't generally
</p>
<p>take a man off a murder mystery case like this and
</p>
<p>send him out of town on some chance affair ; at
</p>
<p>least they didn't do that when I knew the office
</p>
<p>routine. Got a new editor down at your place ? "
</p>
<p>" Nonsense, Lamm," answered Thomas. ' % Emer-
</p>
<p>gencies may arise at any moment in a newspaper
</p>
<p>office. You know that well enough. 1 was pulled
</p>
<p>off the North case for a little while ; but they put
</p>
<p>me back again with lightning-like celerity, as you
</p>
<p>see, for here I am. Now, what have you got to
</p>
<p>tell me ? "
</p>
<p>" First of all, Kingman," the detective said,
</p>
<p>tipped comfortably back in his chair, " I want to tell
</p>
<p>you that I'm a little surprised, to put it mildly, that
</p>
<p>you should have let that young North girl give you
</p>
<p>the slip that night. How did it happen ? "
</p>
<p>" The fortune of war," rejoined Thomas, for the
</p>
<p>moment quite interested in the row of law books on
</p>
<p>the shelf above Mr. Lamm's desk. " The best of
</p>
<p>us get beaten sometimes even you. Of course,
</p>
<p>you have forgotten "
</p>
<p>"I've forgotten nothing, Kingman," said Mr.
</p>
<p>Lamm. " Let it pass. The matter can't be helped.
</p>
<p>Of course I knew it wasn't your fault. And now
</p>
<p>to another subject."
</p>
<p>The detective consulted his little memorandum
</p>
<p>book, and took from its leaves Stackhouse's letter.

</p>
<p>" Never mind to whom it is written," he said.
</p>
<p>1 84 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>" What do you think of it, taken in connection with
</p>
<p>what we know of this man Stackhouse ? "
</p>
<p>Thomas read the letter twice before answering.
</p>
<p>" Looks as though there might be some conspiracy.
</p>
<p>I should like to know who this Marie really is."
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm silently acquiesced in this wish, but
</p>
<p>he said nothing on that point.
</p>
<p>" We have talked over our friend Stackhouse
</p>
<p>considerably, Kingman, first and last," he observed,
</p>
<p>" and I fancied we agreed pretty well for a while.''
</p>
<p>" For a while ? " queried Kingman. " What do
</p>
<p>you mean ? "
</p>
<p>" People change their minds sometimes, and I
</p>
<p>have modified my first opinions regarding the man,"
</p>
<p>continued Mr. Lamm, following the pattern of the
</p>
<p>wall paper opposite his desk with his eye. " A de-
</p>
<p>cidedly abler man is this Stackhouse than a good
</p>
<p>many people give him the credit of being abler
</p>
<p>than I thought at first. He is a smart man a
</p>
<p>4 slick ' man, as they say up in New Hampshire.
</p>
<p>The way in which he has managed to keep North
</p>
<p>& Stackhouse out of bankruptcy all this while shows
</p>
<p>that he has plenty of nerve and a good deal of skill."
</p>
<p>" Not much use without money," was Mr.
</p>
<p>Thomas's sententious comment. " You know what
</p>
<p>people say about it. Firm would have gone to
</p>
<p>smash long ago if it hadn't been bolstered up. And
</p>
<p>all the financial fellows that I have talked with give
</p>
<p>the credit for keeping the firm out of deep water

</p>
<p>MR. LAMM COUGHS BEHIND HIS HAND. 185
</p>
<p>" He's a curious sort of character, that Fetridge,"
</p>
<p>said the detective contemplatively. My opinion is
</p>
<p>that without his money he would amount to but
</p>
<p>precious little."
</p>
<p>"You wouldn't put him down as the Napoleon of
</p>
<p>State Street, then ? " hinted Thomas.
</p>
<p>" No," replied Mr. Lamm. " Why, the man
</p>
<p>hasn't half the ability of Thornton Stackhouse.
</p>
<p>There is a queer streak in the fellow, and it shows
</p>
<p>itself at every turn. Pig-headed enough, but lacks
</p>
<p>balance. Really weak-minded, for all his obstinacy
</p>
<p>in small things. That's my judgment of the man.
</p>
<p>What do you say about him ? "
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas thought a moment.
</p>
<p>" Don't know him as you do, Lamm, but it seems
</p>
<p>to me he must have some good qualities, some little
</p>
<p>ability, to have got on such a friendly footing with
</p>
<p>the Norths."
</p>
<p>" Do you mean the old man, or the woman ? "
</p>
<p>"Well, the family generally."
</p>
<p>" Oh, pshaw ! Paul North only wanted to ' work'
</p>
<p>him for his money, and I rather think you know
</p>
<p>that the girls may have been in with the old gentle-
</p>
<p>man in his laudable endeavor."
</p>
<p>" Perhaps you've seen and heard more about the
</p>
<p>Norths than I," he said a little uncomfortably. " But
</p>
<p>it didn't seem to me "
</p>
<p>" Oh, the girls ? Well, they may not have had
</p>
<p>much to do but to smile sweetly on Fetridge and
</p>
<p>keep him in the firm's traces," continued the de-

</p>
<p>" and, of course, this Fetridge was no fool to be
</p>
<p>caught by the bare hook. He isn't possessed of
</p>
<p>any great amount of brains, but his experience in
</p>
<p>the business world makes up for some of his natural
</p>
<p>shortcomings. However, perhaps this failure will
</p>
<p>bring out the facts about Stackhouse. I hope so.
</p>
<p>It's a bad break, and a great many people have
</p>
<p>gone down with North & Stackhouse. But I
</p>
<p>think Thornton Stackhouse himself has saved noth-
</p>
<p>ing out of the crash."
</p>
<p>" The Norths have gone under, of course ?"
</p>
<p>" Yes. Not a dollar, so far as I can see, will be
</p>
<p>left to them. There's no telling, though, what those
</p>
<p>girls may have managed to pick up and hide all this
</p>
<p>while. That young creature, now, who went off "
</p>
<p>" You mean Miss Stella ? " There was a danger-
</p>
<p>ous look in Thomas's eyes.
</p>
<p>" Certainly. She's a hardened little baggage, I'll
</p>
<p>be bound. Why, man, she was shrewd enough to
</p>
<p>throw you off the scent, and a girl of eighteen who
</p>
<p>can trick Kingman F. Thomas when he's on the
</p>
<p>watch is an abnormally clever sort of creature."
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas abruptly arose and looked out of
</p>
<p>the little window.
</p>
<p>" How do you imagine she got away from you,
</p>
<p>Kingman ? " pursued Mr. Lamm.
</p>
<p>" A piece of bad luck," the reporter returned
</p>
<p>curtly. " We all have those sort of happenings
</p>
<p>sometimes. I suppose the girl watched her chance
</p>
<p>and stole away. Nothing very calculating about

</p>
<p>that, it seems to me. It was her good fortune "
</p>
<p>MR. LAMM COUGHS BEHIND HIS HAND. 187
</p>
<p>" Just so, just so," assented Mr. Lamm. " It's a
</p>
<p>sore spot with you, old fellow, eh ? Well, never
</p>
<p>mind. We know now, of course, who the guilty
</p>
<p>party is in this affair. Never mind Fetridge now.
</p>
<p>Flight is confession, and you can take ample re-
</p>
<p>venge by helping to bring that large-eyed maiden
</p>
<p>who gave you the slip to justice. You see the
</p>
<p>point, Kingman ?"
</p>
<p>"No, I don't," said Mr. Thomas, turning upon
</p>
<p>the ingenious Mr. Lamm in great heat. " What
</p>
<p>morbid state of mind has come over you ? What's
</p>
<p>the matter with you that you go on maundering
</p>
<p>like this?"
</p>
<p>" Maundering ? " Mr. Lamm's face wore a look
</p>
<p>of cleverly assumed astonishment.
</p>
<p>" Yes. Maundering is what I said, and I meant
</p>
<p>it, too. Come ! You don't mean to look me in
</p>
<p>the face and tell me that you think that a timid,
</p>
<p>shrinking girl like Stella North would ever have the
</p>
<p>courage to murder her father, even if she had the
</p>
<p>heart to do it ? "
</p>
<p>" But she ran away "
</p>
<p>There was a tell-tale twitching at the corners of
</p>
<p>the detective's mouth despite his efforts to the
</p>
<p>contrary, observing which Mr. Thomas gave a little
</p>
<p>start, pulled up his shirt collar, relaxed his features,
</p>
<p>laughed, though rather constrainedly, and clapped
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm on the shoulder.
</p>
<p>" Have done with your ' kidding,' old man," he
</p>
<p>said. " I'm not one of the Central Office crowd."

</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm coughed behind his hand.
</p>
<p>1 88 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>" You can't make me believe any of your foolish-
</p>
<p>ness," continued the reporter. " Now talk straight
</p>
<p>for a moment. Stackhouse or Fetridge whom
</p>
<p>shall I watch, now ? "
</p>
<p>" No use to try to cheat you, Kingman," retorted
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm, with an expansive smile. " Well, in
</p>
<p>the present uncertain state of affairs, both must be
</p>
<p>watched. We ought to be here, both of us, to look
</p>
<p>after matters ; but I am suddenly called away and
</p>
<p>this is why I am so glad you came in."
</p>
<p>" Called away ? "
</p>
<p>" Yes ; old Jobson, the clerk at North & Stack-
</p>
<p>house, has just told me in his innocent way all about
</p>
<p>a certain suspicious character that occasionally
</p>
<p>came to see North, and lives in New York. I am
</p>
<p>going to look the man up there, and for a day or
</p>
<p>two you must watch the Boston end for both of us."
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm, after advising Thomas to still watch
</p>
<p>Swampscott, and promising to bring in a man or two
</p>
<p>to help cover the city points, bade the reporter a
</p>
<p>friendly " good-by," and went from his office directly
</p>
<p>toward the Albany station.
</p>
<p>But the protuberance on his valise, which marked
</p>
<p>the sojourning place of the very rigid hair brush
</p>
<p>which was Mr. North's constant traveling compan-
</p>
<p>ion, soon pointed north instead of south. It was
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas whom the detective followed. Seeing
</p>
<p>him enter the office of his newspaper, Mr. Lamm
</p>
<p>turned back, deposited his valise in his office, and
</p>
<p>betook himself to Court Square.

<p>" Nowak, how are you ? "
</p>
<p>MR. LAMM COUGHS BEHIND HIS HAND. 189
</p>
<p>Thus hailed the detective a tall, well-built, well-
</p>
<p>dressed young man who was crossing the pave-
</p>
<p>ment at a brisk pace.
</p>
<p>" Hallo, Lamm, how goes everything?" the re-
</p>
<p>porter said.
</p>
<p>" Quietly, quietly. How are the boys in the
</p>
<p>Globe office ? I hardly ever see them nowadays,
</p>
<p>not even Kingman, whom I used to run across so
</p>
<p>often."
</p>
<p>" Kingman ? " said Mr. Nowak. " Oh, he's busy
</p>
<p>on the North mystery. Doesn't do anything else.
</p>
<p>Has his own time, and flits in and out of the office
</p>
<p>at all sorts of odd hours. Sometimes he's in a
</p>
<p>dozen times a day. And then, again, the editor
</p>
<p>may not see him for twenty-four hours or more.
</p>
<p>But Kingman is a privileged character, you know.
</p>
<p>He never wastes his time when he is on a job."
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm nodded his head emphatically.
</p>
<p>" You're right, Nowak. The word shirk is not in
</p>
<p>Kingman F. Thomas's vocabulary. You are quite
</p>
<p>positive that he has not had any other work but the
</p>
<p>North case ? "
</p>
<p>" Oh, sure. They wouldn't take him off of it
</p>
<p>under any circumstances, now, when the facts are
</p>
<p>liable to come out any hour."
</p>
<p>" I hope he isn't wasting his time and energy.
</p>
<p>It's a queer case, isn't it ? "
</p>
<p>" Deuced queer."
</p>
<p>With a friendly hand-grasp the two parted. Mr.
</p>
<p>Lamm proceeding to a drug store close at hand,

</p>
<p>consulted the chained directory, and found in a
</p>
<p>19 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>minute a certain address desired. Boarding a car,
</p>
<p>he journeyed southward.
</p>
<p>Where the streets began to show bits of garden
</p>
<p>in front of the houses, and every brick wall was
</p>
<p>not a party wall, Mr. Lamm alighted, and walked
</p>
<p>up a pleasant-looking avenue.
</p>
<p>A new apartment house, not far from the corner,
</p>
<p>appeared to have a particular interest for John
</p>
<p>Lamm. In its neighborhood, indeed, he passed
</p>
<p>the better part of an hour. Without apparent
</p>
<p>effort, Mr. Lamm entered into an easy conversation
</p>
<p>with several people there and thereabouts, and, as
</p>
<p>a result thereof, there was a sudden transfer of
</p>
<p>especial interest from the family hotel to the build-
</p>
<p>ing next door.
</p>
<p>Mr. Melon's modest dwelling was by no means
</p>
<p>equal in height to its neighbor. But its graveled
</p>
<p>roof, nevertheless, offered certain facilities that the
</p>
<p>detective greatly desired. A brief colloquy was all
</p>
<p>that proved necessary to gain the desired permis-
</p>
<p>sion.
</p>
<p>Once upon the roof, Mr. Lamm placed himself
</p>
<p>behind a sheltering chimney, and'cautiously peered
</p>
<p>into the windows of the neighboring building that
</p>
<p>overlooked the place.
</p>
<p>All the curtains were up, and the light, stream-
</p>
<p>ing cheerfully into what was evidently a sitting
</p>
<p>room, brought into relief the face of a motherly-
</p>
<p>looking old lady, busied with her knitting.
</p>
<p>Presently she looked up ; and soon the sight of

</p>
<p>another face rewarded John Lamm's watch. It
</p>
<p>MR. LAMM COUGHS BEHIND HIS HAND. 19*
</p>
<p>was the face of a short, rather thick-set young man,
</p>
<p>whose dark-brown, kindly eyes had looked into his
</p>
<p>own not many hours before.
</p>
<p>The detective noted them carefully as the)" stood
</p>
<p>talking together earnestly. He saw them turn
</p>
<p>quickly, and as the rays of the setting sun shone
</p>
<p>through the glass, another form came into full view.
</p>
<p>It was a woman's figure.
</p>
<p>John Lamm looked with all his eyes. There
</p>
<p>was no mistake ; no room for error. It was as
</p>
<p>he thought and hoped, and a smile of absolute
</p>
<p>satisfaction played about his lips unconsciously.
</p>
<p>Suddenly he drew back. The thick-set young
</p>
<p>man in the room opposite was just turning round.
</p>
<p>Before he could peer out of the window, in his turn,
</p>
<p>the form was out of view. When the sidelong
</p>
<p>glance was next directed outwards the blinds were
</p>
<p>drawn over the tell-tale window. But the precau-
</p>
<p>tion came too late. The next moment Lamm found
</p>
<p>his way down the stairs, thanked Mr. Molon be-
</p>
<p>hind the counter kindly for his courtesy, walked up
</p>
<p>the street, and took a car citywards.
</p>
<p>" Ah, my black-haired friend," he thought, ex-
</p>
<p>ultingly, " a very clever scheme of yours. But
</p>
<p>walls have eyes for John Lamm once in a while,
</p>
<p>Kingman, and though you've kept your secret well
</p>
<p>from the crowd, you couldn't conceal it from your
</p>
<p>partner. What would Applebee say, what would
</p>
<p>Stackhouse say, for that matter, if they knew that

<p>Kingman F. Thomas had a pretty guest, none other

<p>than the strangely missing Stella North ? "
</p>
<p>CHAPTER XV.
</p>
<p>THE THING HAS A DARK LOOK.
</p>
<p>"/"^OME in, Kingman. You are prompt. I'm
</p>
<p>\s obliged to you."
</p>
<p>Wednesday morning, and Detective Lamm at
</p>
<p>the threshold of his office was welcoming his friend
</p>
<p>the reporter.
</p>
<p>" Yes," said Thomas, unaware of the peculiar
</p>
<p>expression with which his associate regarded him.
</p>
<p>" Your note, left at the office, seemed to be urgent."
</p>
<p>" You are right. It was urgent. Sit down."
</p>
<p>John Lamm locked the door and put the key in
</p>
<p>his pocket. And standing with his back against it,
</p>
<p>said, seriously :
</p>
<p>" Thomas, I have always considered you as an
</p>
<p>excellent detective. I have changed my mind."
</p>
<p>" Well, what now ? " asked Thomas uneasily,
</p>
<p>glancing keenly at his friend, and thereafter avoid-
</p>
<p>ing his gaze.
</p>
<p>" This," said Lamm, measuring his words ; " the
</p>
<p>man who allows himself to be side-tracked in an
</p>
<p>important case by a pretty face and a pair of
</p>
<p>blue eyes has a cardinal weakness that sooner or
</p>
<p>later is sure to tell against him in business."
</p>
<p>Thomas started, flushed, but controlled himself.

</p>
<p>" Did you go clear to New York to find that
</p>
<p>out ? "
</p>
<p>" I have not been to New York," said Lamm
</p>
<p>quietly. " I have been here in Boston hard at
</p>
<p>work upon the latest and most curious feature of
</p>
<p>the North case."
</p>
<p>" Come," said Thomas desperately, " say what
</p>
<p>you mean. Don't talk in riddles."
</p>
<p>" I mean that I know all about it, Thomas. I
</p>
<p>know that Kingman F. Thomas, who has done in
</p>
<p>his day as excellent detective work as anybody in
</p>
<p>the State, has at last fallen into the snare of the
</p>
<p>siren, and forgotten his duty. In other words,
</p>
<p>he is in love with one of the principals. Instead
</p>
<p>of arresting her he guards her. While the police
</p>
<p>are searching everywhere for her, he has her
</p>
<p>secretly hidden in his own house right under their
</p>
<p>very noses, and comes to his best friend with a
</p>
<p>coolness that might (if he were a little less wary)
</p>
<p>have ruined his work on the case."
</p>
<p>" John, you presume on your friendship," said
</p>
<p>Thomas hotly. He had been nervously fingering
</p>
<p>his wAtch charm, and alternating between white
</p>
<p>and red, throughout Lamm's quiet speech, but he
</p>
<p>now started up and faced the detective squarely-
</p>
<p>" You have no right to assume that there is any
</p>
<p>sentiment in the matter. You go too far when you
</p>
<p>charge me with letting my personal feelings run
</p>
<p>away with my sense of duty. You don't know what
</p>
<p>my object was is."

</p>
<p>" Ah, but pardon me, Kingman ; I assume that I
</p>
<p>194 WRITTEN IN RED,
</p>
<p>do. If it had been in the ordinary course of your
</p>
<p>professional business, you would have come to me
</p>
<p>with it for advice or assistance, just as you have
</p>
<p>always done when we have associated ourselves
</p>
<p>on a case before. There is only one reason why
</p>
<p>you didn't come : you were more than afraid that I
</p>
<p>would never approve of so rash a proceeding on
</p>
<p>your part, and you were resolved upon taking the
</p>
<p>step at all hazards. In other words, Kingman, you
</p>
<p>were a little ashamed."
</p>
<p>Thomas had regained control of himself. He
</p>
<p>drew himself up.
</p>
<p>" See here, John Lamm, we will leave my motives
</p>
<p>out of the question, if you please. I have protected
</p>
<p>the girl. I propose to continue to do so. She was
</p>
<p>in a hard place a harder one than you know any-
</p>
<p>thing about. I should have been less than a man
</p>
<p>if I had neglected to do what I did. To have
</p>
<p>given her up under the circumstances would have
</p>
<p>been the height of cruelty. You wouldn't have
</p>
<p>done it yourself. Every bit of circumstantial
</p>
<p>evidence was overwhelmingly against her. I de-
</p>
<p>termined to conceal her till I could discover at
</p>
<p>least proofs of her innocence sufficient to prevent
</p>
<p>her from the ignominy of an arrest. Since you
</p>
<p>have discovered the fact there is no help for it.
</p>
<p>You must aid me to keep the secret."
</p>
<p>"Only upon one condition, Kingman. I must
</p>
<p>know all the facts."

</p>
<p>hers ? " asked Thomas, with peculiar emphasis on
</p>
<p>the second pronoun.
</p>
<p>"But isn't that rather broad?" Lamm hesitated.
</p>
<p>Thomas compressed his lips tightly.
</p>
<p>"This girl has confessed everything to ine,
</p>
<p>Lamm ; and in return I have given her my word to
</p>
<p>do everything in my power to protect her family
</p>
<p>from disgrace. There's no way out of it. You
</p>
<p>must promise me."
</p>
<p>" What do you mean ? " demanded Lamm sternly.
</p>
<p>" Do you mean if I find that the murderer of Paul
</p>
<p>North is in her family I am to keep it to myself ? "
</p>
<p>" Decidedly not," said Thomas. "But you must
</p>
<p>have proof, not appearances."
</p>
<p>" Oh, certainly," said Lamm. " I agree to that.
</p>
<p>Hang the appearances in a case. They are seldom
</p>
<p>right. I use appearances only to enable me to get
</p>
<p>at the facts. But once I get at the facts, Thomas,
</p>
<p>understand me, it will make no difference whose
</p>
<p>family it is in."
</p>
<p>"Very well," said Thomas, "we understand each
</p>
<p>other. Give me your hand on it."
</p>
<p>The two men shook hands over the compact,
</p>
<p>and sat down close together beside the detective's
</p>
<p>desk.
</p>
<p>"In the first place," began Thomas, "it was
</p>
<p>Stella North who threw the pistol into the water at
</p>
<p>Swampscott on Sunday night and then fled from
</p>
<p>her home."
</p>
<p>" I had guessed as much when I learned that

</p>
<p>North's shooter had been found."
</p>
<p>I9 6 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>" At that time I hadn't the faintest idea who the
</p>
<p>fugitive was, and when I recognized her on the
</p>
<p>Connecticut roadside I was nearly as much aston-

<p>ished as she was frightened. The first thing I
</p>
<p>thought was that she must be guilty. All her
</p>
<p>actions the headlong, precipitate flight ; her terror
</p>
<p>at my appearance all seemed to wear the look of
</p>
<p>criminality. She had fainted dead away, but she
</p>
<p>soon began to come to herself again. Thereupon
</p>
<p>I tied my horse to a tree, and drew her into the
</p>
<p>woods, out of sight of passers. She was so weak
</p>
<p>and emotional I believed her ripe for a confession.
</p>
<p>Lamm, I fully expected at that moment to be
</p>
<p>rewarded for my efforts by a tremendous discovery.
</p>
<p>But I tell you, as I looked at the poor thing
</p>
<p>hardly a woman yet lying there on the leaves,
</p>
<p>pale, speechless, frightened nearly out of her senses,
</p>
<p>I never felt so sorry for anybody in my life."
</p>
<p>" I know the feeling," said Lamm. "I've had it
</p>
<p>myself. But go on."
</p>
<p>" Well, when she came to, I began to talk to her.
</p>
<p>Of course there was a scene. She broke down
</p>
<p>completely, and at her first words I understood
</p>
<p>what I ought to have had sense enough to have
</p>
<p>known from the first that her terror was not on
</p>
<p>her own account. ' Oh, don't let them arrest her ! '
</p>
<p>she kept saying. ' Don't, I beg of you ! She's
</p>
<p>crazy ! She must be ! She never could have done
</p>
<p>it in her senses ! ' '

<p>" ' Come/ I said, ' tell me the whole story ; it's
</p>
<p>the quickest way out of it. And I give you my
</p>
<p>word of honor I'll do what I can to help you.' Bui
</p>
<p>it was a long time before I was able to bring her to
</p>
<p>the point of trusting me. I don't know how it was
</p>
<p>exactly, but she gradually "
</p>
<p>" Pshaw ! " said Lamm. " Don't embarrass your-
</p>
<p>self. Skip it. I know what happened as well as you
</p>
<p>do. She was in deep distress. You were in earnest.
</p>
<p>She trusted you. Good. What was her story ? "
</p>
<p>" She didn't tell me the whole story at that time,"
</p>
<p>said Thomas. "I stopped her when I knew the
</p>
<p>essential facts, for I realized her danger and in-
</p>
<p>cidentally my own. I impressed upon her the
</p>
<p>necessity of obeying me implicitly. I told her
</p>
<p>there was but one way to save either herself or her
</p>
<p>sister, or both of them, from the ignominy of imme-
</p>
<p>diate arrest, and all the attendant scandal. Fright-
</p>
<p>ened to death almost, and shaking like a leaf, she
</p>
<p>acquiesced. I stowed her as comfortably as I
</p>
<p>could in the bottom of the carriage, and covered
</p>
<p>her with a rug. Overcome with exhaustion, she, I
</p>
<p>believe, actually slept all the way to Vernon.
</p>
<p>Outside the town I awoke her, made her get out,
</p>
<p>and told her to follow me at a distance, and to
</p>
<p>board the train that I took, but by no means to
</p>
<p>speak to me. She was veiled, and had enough
</p>
<p>money to purchase her ticket."

</p>
<p>"Ah! I knew, you see, that the whole police
</p>
<p>force must be on her track by this time. As soon
</p>
<p>as she was missed from Svvampscott, I knew they
</p>
<p>would be in full chase, and she, in her innocence,
</p>
<p>had left a trail as plain as the milky way."
</p>
<p>"Of course," said Detective Lamm, significantly.
</p>
<p>" And so," Thomas continued, " I laid my plans
</p>
<p>accordingly. We rode to Boston separately, and
</p>
<p>she followed me on foot on the other side of the
</p>
<p>street to my house. She was whiter than death
</p>
<p>when she came in ; but if you know my mother
</p>
<p>yon can imagine the reception she got. Five min-
</p>
<p>utes' explanation to my mother was sufficient. She
</p>
<p>opened her arms to the fugitive, and Stella North
</p>
<p>has been under her charge ever since."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! and you, of course, got the whole story
</p>
<p>from the girl ? "
</p>
<p>" That night. There is no question about her

<p>frankness or her honesty. If you could talk with

<p>with her ten minutes you would be assured of that."
</p>
<p>" Undoubtedly. And now for the facts. What
</p>
<p>are they ? "
</p>
<p>" Well, Lamm," said Thomas, " there are two sets
</p>
<p>of facts the immediate and the remote. Whether
</p>
<p>the remote have any relation to the immediate I
</p>
<p>cannot tell. Nevertheless, you shall hear them

</p>
<p>nection with this murder, Lamm. It's a mystery,
</p>
<p>old man, as you will soon see. Stella merely cor-
</p>
<p>roborated the facts that I have told you already
</p>
<p>about Fetridge's connection with the family. It
</p>
<p>was just as I said : he was in love with Marion,
</p>
<p>but how far they went, whether they were actually
</p>
<p>engaged or not, nobody knows ; not even Stella,
</p>
<p>for the fact comes out that Marion is a very peculiar
</p>
<p>woman."
</p>
<p>" Peculiar ? Do you mean eccentric ? "
</p>
<p>" Well, eccentric, perhaps," said Thomas, doubt-
</p>
<p>fully. " What I mean is that she is exceedingly
</p>
<p>self-willed and self-reliant ; that she is naturally
</p>
<p>secretive, dislikes to make confidants, repels inter-
</p>
<p>course on topics near to her, dislikes to be sympa-
</p>
<p>thized with, and is extremely sensitive about little
</p>
<p>things that ordinary people would pass unobserved.
</p>
<p>Exaggerate all these qualities to an unusual degree
</p>
<p>and you have the traits that make Marion Stack-
</p>
<p>house peculiar. If you call such a character eccen-
</p>
<p>tric, she's eccentric. If you mean, however, the
</p>
<p>eccentricity that is allied to monomania or insanity,
</p>
<p>I fail to find that she has ever exhibited any traces
</p>
<p>of it. I questioned Stella very particularly on this
</p>
<p>point as to whether her sister was in the habit of
</p>
<p>taking queer freaks. She says it might seem so to
</p>
<p>anybody who was not familiar with her peculiar
</p>
<p>temperament, but she never knew her to do any-
</p>
<p>t ling without the possibility of a reason therefor."
</p>
<p>" Just my idea cf her exactly," said Lamm.

<p>200 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>of a maniac knows what it is. I have talked with
</p>
<p>Marion Stackhouse face to face. She is no more
</p>
<p>insane than I am."
</p>
<p>" I say this," continued Thomas, " to explain
</p>
<p>why it was that nobody knew whether Marion was
</p>
<p>really engaged to Fetridge. On account of the
</p>
<p>opposition of Mr. North, it would have been a
</p>
<p>secret, anyway, to some extent, but Stella never
</p>
<p>knew. She only knows that they were together a
</p>
<p>great deal, till one night they presumably quar-
</p>
<p>reled, for his visits ceased abruptly. And the next
</p>
<p>thing Stella knew, the engagement to Stackhouse
</p>
<p>was announced."
</p>
<p>" Wasn't this a marriage from pique, then, such
</p>
<p>as we occasionally hear of ? "
</p>
<p>" So I fancy, Lamm. Stella will not express her
</p>
<p>opinion to that effect, but I can see that she thinks
</p>
<p>so. Well, now, as to Fetridge coming back into
</p>
<p>the family again since his return from Australia, it
</p>
<p>was just as we surmised, ostensibly to pay Stella
</p>
<p>some attentions ; but the girl declares that he never
</p>
<p>spoke of love to her, though he had plenty of
</p>
<p>opportunity."
</p>
<p>"Which indicates," said Lamm quietly, "that Fet-
</p>
<p>ridge still came to see Marion, despite her marriage
</p>
<p>to Stackhouse."
</p>
<p>" So it would seem ; and that she regretted her
</p>
<p>hasty step in marrying too soon. Well, but this is
</p>
<p>only speculation. To go on with facts : Fetridge's

<p>than that of a pleasant acquaintance but after his
</p>
<p>departure on his recent business trip, the purpose
</p>
<p>of which we can't determine, it came to her ears
</p>
<p>that there was a great deal of gossip about their
</p>
<p>association. She determined to be more careful in
</p>
<p>the future. The day before the murder, Fetridge
</p>
<p>reappeared at the house. It would seem that the
</p>
<p>instant he got home he came to the North house-
</p>
<p>hold. He began to lay out plans at once to go
</p>
<p>hither and yon with the girl. But the poor thing's
</p>
<p>suspicions were aroused by her long month of reflec-
</p>
<p>tion. She determined not to be made a catspaw of
</p>
<p>for any purpose, and at the first opportunity hav-
</p>
<p>ing summoned up the necessary courage she
</p>
<p>broached the tabooed subject to her sister."
</p>
<p>" What time of day was this ? "
</p>
<p>" It seems to have been about the middle of the
</p>
<p>afternoon. Marion was not feeling very well. She
</p>
<p>was lying down, and Stella was sitting beside her
</p>
<p>with a fan. Marion introduced Fetridge's name
</p>
<p>herself, making some inquiries about his visit of the
</p>
<p>previous evening. Then Stella made so bold as to
</p>
<p>ask her advice, and finally told what her suspicions
</p>
<p>were."
</p>
<p>" But you don't mean "
</p>
<p>" Simply that Fetridge pretended to pay atten-
</p>
<p>tions to her (Stella) for the sake of appearances,
</p>
<p>and that his real object was to be near Marion."
</p>
<p>" Whew ! Knowing the woman, I can imagine

<p>the result."

<p>" Easily. But Stella was innocent enough. She
</p>
<p>202 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>merely intended to give her sister a well-meant
</p>
<p>warning. Marion received it as an insult. ' It is
</p>
<p>a jealous lie,' she cries into the ears of the aston-
</p>
<p>ished Stella. ' Richard Fetridge never meant to
</p>
<p>marry me ; never cared a feather for me. If you
</p>
<p>had asked me I could have told you so. But since
</p>
<p>you thought it better to play the spy on me, why,
</p>
<p>I'll prove it to you." And with a great emphasis
</p>
<p>on the word prove, she dashed out of the room."
</p>
<p>" This woman is curious. No doubt about it.
</p>
<p>But her conscience troubles her, and she's jealous
</p>
<p>of Fetridge. There's no other explanation of this
</p>
<p>line of conduct."
</p>
<p>" Ah, well," said Thomas doubtfully, " if Marion
</p>
<p>had married Stackhouse purely from pique, and
</p>
<p>had been carrying on the hollow mockery for a
</p>
<p>whole year, because she was too proud to betray
</p>
<p>what she suffered to any living soul, it seems that
</p>
<p>there might be enough inflammable material in her
</p>
<p>emotional nature to get up a good blaze at the first
</p>
<p>spark. Don't you think so? "
</p>
<p>" Quite likely. It's logically put, anyhow. But
</p>
<p>about these proofs that Fetridge didn't care for her.
</p>
<p>I am anxious to know the nature of them."
</p>
<p>" So am I ; but unfortunately they disappear from
</p>
<p>my story with this reference to them. Stella natur-
</p>
<p>ally supposed Marion went upstairs to get some-
</p>

<p>see her driving off in a carriage. In a short time

</p>
<p>ceedingly alarmed. What in the world could have
</p>
<p>occasioned this sudden freak she could not imagine.
</p>
<p>That her sister was terribly angry she saw, and the
</p>
<p>insane idea that perhaps she intended to tell Rich-
</p>
<p>ard Fetridge what had been said drove the poor
</p>
<p>girl quite distracted. She followed Marion to the
</p>
<p>city in the next train, and searched everywhere for
</p>
<p>her. It was after six when she arrived, and all the
</p>
<p>places of business were closed. This circumstance
</p>
<p>only increased the girl's alarm. She began to have
</p>
<p>what she calls a presentiment of evil. There were
</p>
<p>three places in town where she thought her sister
</p>
<p>might be the houses of three friends. One of
</p>
<p>them was a way out in Roxbury. She made the
</p>
<p>rounds, exciting everywhere wonder and concern ;
</p>
<p>but she abruptly refused all offers of escort. It was
</p>
<p>getting later and later all the time. Already it was
</p>
<p>dark, and the street lights were burning. Suddenly
</p>
<p>she remembered that Marion had the keys to the
</p>
<p>house in Marlboro Street. There was a bare possi-
</p>
<p>bility that she had gone there in quest of the proofs
</p>
<p>she had so mysteriously mentioned. Stella set her-
</p>
<p>self in that direction. It must have been about
</p>
<p>half-past nine o'clock when she approached the
</p>
<p>place, and saw what do you think ? Marion
</p>
<p>Stackhouse coming down the steps ! "
</p>
<p>The imperturbable John Lamm for once lost his
</p>
<p>professional sang froid. He sprang to his feet,
</p>
<p>and brought his hand down with a crash upon the
</p>
<p>top of his desk.

<p>* TT is significant to you, then ? " Thomas asked,
</p>
<p>1 uneasily, with a faint smile.
</p>
<p>" Oh, certainly not," returned John Lamm, sar-
</p>
<p>castically. " It doesn't mean anything. But don't
</p>
<p>delay. How did Marion act ? What did she have
</p>
<p>to say for herself ? "
</p>
<p>The detective, instead of resuming his seat,
</p>
<p>began to walk about the room with his hands
</p>
<p>behind him.
</p>
<p>" She hadn't anything to say for herself," returned
</p>
<p>Thomas. " That's just the trouble. She acted
</p>
<p>queer queerer than Stella had ever seen her act
</p>
<p>in her life."
</p>
<p>" How queer?"
</p>
<p>" As the girl expresses it, she seemed like a per-
</p>
<p>son walking in her sleep. She spoke to Stella but
</p>
<p>in a mechanical way, as if her mind were quite
</p>
<p>elsewhere all the time. They went back to the
</p>
<p>depot and rode out to Swampscott together."
</p>
<p>" Do you mean to say that Marion expressed no
</p>
<p>surprise when she saw Stella in the street ? "
</p>
<p>" Momentarily she seemed aroused, but as soon
</p>
<p>as Stella began to account for herself she relapsed
</p>
<p>into her ' frozen ' condition again."

</p>
<p>" What a woman she is ! "
</p>
<p>" She was not strong enough to conceal from her
</p>
<p>sister that something terrible had happened. She
</p>
<p>was so dazed and unnatural that the young girl
</p>
<p>was frantic with apprehension."
</p>
<p>" Of course this places it beyond a doubt that
</p>
<p>Marion had either killed her legal father or had
</p>
<p>seen him killed."
</p>
<p>" But, my dear Lamm, I can't entertain the first
</p>
<p>idea for a minute. What possible motive could
</p>
<p>there be for her ? "
</p>
<p>" It is to be determined simply by the fact of
</p>
<p>whether the girl was alone in the house that night."
</p>
<p>" Ah, precisely. That is what I am working to
</p>
<p>find out. Well, Lamm, on the whole journey home,
</p>
<p>Marion Stackhouse had but two sentences to utter
</p>
<p>which seem to have any bearing upon the case.
</p>
<p>The first was when Stella made some mention of
</p>
<p>Stackhouse. ' Never speak to me of that man
</p>
<p>again,' said Marion fiercely. ' He is not my hus-
</p>
<p>band.' And again, just before they got to the
</p>
<p>house, seizing her sister's wrist, ' Stella,' she whis-
</p>
<p>pered, ' do you want to see me in my grave ? Then
</p>
<p>never tell a living soul where I have been.' "
</p>
<p>" Thunder and guns! " ejaculated Lamm. " That
</p>
<p>woman is the princess of mysteries. Doesn't it
</p>
<p>strike you a little peculiar that she should continue
</p>
<p>to assert that Stackhouse is not her husband ?
</p>
<p>Mind you, she always puts it in that way. I have
</p>
<p>heard her say it myself. ' He is not my husband.'

</p>
<p>Now why shouldn't she say, ' I refuse to live with
</p>
<p>206 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>this man any longer,' not for ever, ' He is not my
</p>
<p>husband.' Wasn't the marriage public ? "
</p>
<p>" To be sure it was. The marriage occurred in
</p>
<p>St. Paul's Church, in the presence of hundreds of
</p>
<p>people."
</p>
<p>Lamm came and placed his hand softly on the
</p>
<p>reporter's shoulder.
</p>
<p>" You don't imagine, Thomas," he questioned
</p>
<p>below his breath, " that she has been secretly mar-
</p>
<p>ried to this man Fetridge previous to his departure
</p>
<p>for Australia ? "
</p>
<p>" What an idea! " cried Thomas, amused. " You
</p>
<p>seem anxious to give her a monomania on the mar-
</p>
<p>riage question. If married already to Fetridge
</p>
<p>what earthly reason could induce her to marry
</p>
<p>Stackhouse ? It seems to me that you have got a
</p>
<p>complication there not likely to arise in any well-
</p>
<p>regulated family."
</p>
<p>"Perhaps. But I've gone far enough in this
</p>
<p>'case to know that there is something different be-
</p>
<p>hind it than anything I ever met with in all my life
</p>
<p>before. But to go on. Of course Stella is frightened
</p>
<p>to death by Marion's reference to the grave, and
</p>
<p>refrained from telling anybody where she had seen
</p>
<p>her, until you got it out of her."
</p>
<p>" So you might know by the way things have
</p>
<p>gone on. She was scared enough that night,
</p>
<p>you may be sure, but the next day when the news
</p>
<p>came of the murder you can imagine the effect.

</p>
<p>Justice will overtake the guilty. Let me alone. If

<p>which was scarcely calculated to appease Stella's
</p>
<p>agony of apprehension. It was not, however, till
</p>
<p>the young girl discovered that her sister was sleep-
</p>
<p>ing with her father's pistol under her pillow that
</p>
<p>she quite lost her head, and believed that Marion
</p>
<p>wes really guilty."
</p>
<p>" What ! The weapon that killed Paul North ? "
</p>
<p>asked the detective, almost helpless with amaze-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>" Presumably, since she must have brought it
</p>
<p>with her from the Marlboro Street house the night
</p>
<p>of the murder, and one of its barrels had been re-
</p>
<p>cently discharged."
</p>
<p>" What a nerve that woman has ! " murmured the
</p>
<p>detective. "And how in the world did Stella make
</p>
<p>the discovery ? "
</p>
<p>" I'll tell you, Lamm. It was in the middle of
</p>
<p>the night on Saturday. The body of the murdered
</p>
<p>man had been brought home, and it lay in the hall
</p>
<p>below stairs ready for the funeral. You can
</p>
<p>imagine the effect on this young girl, who is of an

<p>affectionate disposition, and whose life up to this
</p>
<p>208 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>time had been one merry smile. Everything goes
</p>
<p>to show that she was the petted darling of her
</p>
<p>father. Of course, however fond and proud any-
</p>
<p>body might have been of Marion, she was scarcely
</p>
<p>the person to be made a pet of. And with this
</p>
<p>awful cloud of horror and suspicion weighing upon
</p>
<p>her, Stella could not sleep. The ghost of the
</p>
<p>poisoned King of Denmark was no more real to
</p>
<p>Hamlet than was the spirit of her father, threaten-
</p>
<p>ing with awful finger the perpetrators of his wo-
</p>
<p>ful murder, to this young girl. Her fears for Marion
</p>
<p>under the weight of the night became absolutely
</p>
<p>appalling. Though not what is called a religious
</p>
<p>girl, Stella could no longer trust to any earthly
</p>
<p>aid. She resolved to go and pray by Marion's
</p>
<p>bedside."
</p>
<p>" Natural enough in this eighteen-year-old girl,"
</p>
<p>commented the detective.
</p>
<p>" It was the last effort, you understand, to obtain
</p>
<p>contrition from the woman who had been imper-
</p>
<p>vious to the most piteous appeals, the most solemn
</p>
<p>entreaties. The poor girl went and found her sis-
</p>
<p>ter's door unlocked. She approached the bedside.
</p>
<p>It seems that Marion was asleep, but her sleep was
</p>
<p>light ; her dreams perhaps troubled, for she sprang
</p>
<p>up suddenly with an awful cry and grasped Stella
</p>
<p>by the shoulders, demanding in a tone that nearly
</p>
<p>frightened her sister out of her senses, ' What do
</p>
<p>you want ? What do you want ? ' She shook her
</p>
<p>so that Stella made a frantic effort to get away.

</p>
<p>In the struggle the pillow was dragged from the
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY! 209
</p>
<p>bed and something beneath it fell with a crash.
</p>
<p>Marion by this time awoke to a realization of her
</p>
<p>surroundings. She sprang out of bed with a haste
</p>
<p>that could not escape Stella's observation, and picked
</p>
<p>up the something which had fallen. ' What is it ? '
</p>
<p>demands the startled Stella. ' Nothing,' replies
</p>
<p>Marion. ' What is the matter, dear ? ' 'Go back
</p>
<p>to your bed and I will come to you.' But no.
</p>
<p>Affairs had reached a climax now where suspicion
</p>
<p>must either be allayed or confirmed. Marion was
</p>
<p>confused and dismayed by the sudden transforma-
</p>
<p>tion in her sister, and before she could regain con-
</p>
<p>trol of herself the hand of the younger girl came in
</p>
<p>contact with the cold steel. ' It is father's pistol,'
</p>
<p>whispered Stella, in what state of mind you may
</p>
<p>imagine. ' Don't deny it, Marion : you have been
</p>
<p>sleeping with it under your pillow.' 'I wont deny
</p>
<p>it,' said Marion, considerably disturbed. ' But why
</p>
<p>will you insanely insist upon knowing things which
</p>
<p>it would be better for your peace of mind to remain
</p>
<p>ignorant of ? ' "
</p>
<p>" And all this time it was quite dark in the
</p>
<p>room ! " Lamm asked.
</p>
<p>" Absolutely. Stella's conclusion that Marion
</p>
<p>held her father's pistol was one of those intuitive
</p>
<p>leaps at correct conclusions that are peculiar to
</p>
<p>women. And thereupon, almost crazy with terror,
</p>
<p>Stella cries out, 'You killed him, Marion ! It was
</p>
<p>your own hand.' Of course, the moment the words
</p>
<p>were out of her lips she was penitent for having

</p>
<p>uttered them. ' Stella,' says Marion, tremblingly,
</p>
<p>210 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>' your mad suspicions are indiscreet. Do you sup-
</p>
<p>pose I could sleep in this house where the man
</p>
<p>who has given me all that I possess except life is
</p>
<p>lying dead, if the guilt of his death were at my
</p>
<p>door ? And are you the same girl who used to
</p>
<p>cuddle down in my arms in the old days and tell me
</p>
<p>that you loved me better than any one in the world
</p>
<p>except papa ? Tell me, do you remember what I
</p>
<p>owe to this man who was more than a father to me ?
</p>
<p>Have you forgotten who it was that nursed him in
</p>
<p>his last illness because he couldn't bear to have a
</p>
<p>hired nurse profane him with unsympathetic hands?
</p>
<p>Can you recall ever in my life a single expression
</p>
<p>of ingratitude ' "
</p>
<p>" Bosh ! " interrupted the detective, " That is
</p>
<p>all very well for Stella, but for me it is necessary to
</p>
<p>be told how she became possessed of that pistol
</p>
<p>which was supposed to be locked in Paul North's
</p>
<p>desk in Marlboro Street."
</p>
<p>" Unfortunately," returned Thomas uneasily,
</p>
<p>" she neither explained nor apologized for her con-
</p>
<p>duct. You know what women are. Stella's heart,
</p>
<p>which is not located far from the surface, was
</p>
<p>touched. She began to cry and to plead for for-
</p>
<p>giveness. And then Marion forgave her ; but just
</p>
<p>as soon as Stella began to beg for an explanation
</p>
<p>the woman said to her very coldly, ' Go to your
</p>
<p>aunt, dear. What you want is somebody to dry
</p>
<p>your tears and soothe you. I am no comforter in a
</p>
<p>time like this, and I certainly shall not tell you

</p>
<p>things which would only add to your worry and
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY! 211
</p>
<p>distress.' And she did go to her aunt ; not to
</p>
<p>make a confidante of her, but to beg for consola-
</p>
<p>tion and sympathy."
</p>
<p>"And this scene between the girls ended in
</p>
<p>nothing, then ? "
</p>
<p>" It ended just as I have told you. But Stella,
</p>
<p>though she tried her best, could not repress her
</p>
<p>anxiety. She was unable to bear the strain of such
</p>
<p>a position. She constantly saw before her eyes the
</p>
<p>spectacle of the officers entering the house and
</p>
<p>dragging Marion off to prison. In view of all
</p>
<p>these facts, is there anything strange in her event-
</p>
<p>ual action ? The funeral was scarcely over, and
</p>
<p>the family returned to the house, when she hast-
</p>
<p>ened to Marion's room, took the revolver, and fled
</p>
<p>a headlong, terror-stricken flight. Her first idea
</p>
<p>was to put the evidence of Marion's guilt out of
</p>
<p>sight. She threw it into the water, little thinking
</p>
<p>that I was watching her. She says that she had no
</p>
<p>clear idea what she was doing, or where she was
</p>
<p>going ; but she had determined never to go back
</p>
<p>to the house. She felt that she could never face
</p>
<p>her sister again. In the train to Boston she be-
</p>
<p>thought herself of some friends in Hartford, where
</p>
<p>she had often visited, and had always been welcome.
</p>
<p>For that city she therefore set out, only to find that
</p>
<p>the house was closed, and her friends gone to the
</p>
<p>beach for the summer. By this time she was al-
</p>
<p>most crazy from fright, lack of sleep and food, for
</p>
<p>she had been able neither to eat nor rest since the

<p>news of the murder. Heaven knows what would
</p>
<p>212 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>have become of her if accident had not put me
</p>
<p>upon her trail ! Such is the story of Stella North;
</p>
<p>and in view of it, John Lamm, I want to know if
</p>
<p>you blame me for what I have done ? "
</p>
<p>" I blame you for only one thing, Thomas," said
</p>
<p>Lamm earnestly ; " and that was for being afraid
</p>
<p>to trust me with your secret."
</p>
<p>" How did I know in what light you would view
</p>
<p>it ? " returned the reporter, uneasily. " You are
</p>
<p>always so matter-of-fact and business-like. And,
</p>
<p>of course, I am perfectly aware that my present
</p>
<p>position is quite the reverse of business-like."
</p>
<p>" Hang the position ! " exclaimed John Lamm.
</p>
<p>" That's your affai.' It's the inwardness of the
</p>
<p>North case that I'm looking &fter, and your story
</p>
<p>has given me a wonderful pusa Mv^d."
</p>
<p>The detective took out his note-Jook, disfigured
</p>
<p>with his peculiar hieroglyphics, and began at once
</p>
<p>making additions, corrections, and reflections,
</p>
<p>quite as if the problem before him had been one in
</p>
<p>mathematics, and could be approved by applying
</p>
<p>some of the advanced rules of the higher arith-
</p>
<p>metic.
</p>
<p>" Well," said Thomas, after he had watched
</p>
<p>him in silence for some minutes, " what is your
</p>
<p>theory ? "
</p>
<p>" None, Thomas," returned the detective quickly.
</p>
<p>" What is yours ? "
</p>
<p>" That Marion is trying to shield somebody from
</p>
<p>the results of a capital offense."

</p>
<p>" And that somebody is ? "
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY! 213
</p>
<p>" Either Fetridge or Stackhouse."
</p>
<p>" With a leaning toward "
</p>
<p>" Fetridge," said Thomas. " But I should like
</p>
<p>to know which of the men went to the house that
</p>
<p>night, if either before expressing any deep con-
</p>
<p>viction."
</p>
<p>" Ah, quite so. And that I propose to ascertain.
</p>
<p>But go on, Kingman. Your conclusions are always
</p>
<p>logical, and they interest me for that reason. There
</p>
<p>is no crime without a motive. What was the
</p>
<p>motive ? "
</p>
<p>" My dear fellow," said Thomas, " that is just
</p>
<p>the mistake made by criminal theorists. But you
</p>
<p>and I know that the majority of murders are done
</p>
<p>without adequate motives. Few men in these days
</p>
<p>plot to kill. They kill when they are insane with
</p>
<p>rum or jealousy, or to defend themselves."
</p>
<p>" You emphasize that, I see ! "
</p>
<p>" Because I have thought it right along," said
</p>
<p>the reporter. " The fact that the bullet must have
</p>
<p>been fired from a point lower down than an erect
</p>
<p>man naturally carries his hand leads me to believe
</p>
<p>that the murderer of Paul North was on his knees ;
</p>
<p>and it is logical to presume from that that he had
</p>
<p>been knocked down."
</p>
<p>" Clever ! " said John Lamm, with genuine ad-
</p>
<p>miration. " Clever, and just like you, Thomas.
</p>
<p>Of course we can think of hundreds of reasons why
</p>
<p>North might have knocked down his partner, whose
</p>
<p>advice had ruined him for North was steady

</p>
<p>ence or why he should have knocked down an
</p>
<p>importunate gentleman who might have been trying
</p>
<p>to deceive his daughter."
</p>
<p>" Precisely," agreed Thomas.
</p>
<p>" And then," said Lamm slowly, " you throw the
</p>
<p>idea of a most deliberate and cunningly-laid con-
</p>
<p>spiracy of murder for security and revenge out of
</p>
<p>the question."
</p>
<p>" Conspiracy? " echoed Thomas.
</p>
<p>" Conspiracy ! " said John Lamm.
</p>
<p>Thomas looked like a doubtful man who would
</p>
<p>be very glad to become convinced.
</p>
<p><l Yes," said John Lamm in a tone of deep con-
</p>
<p>viction. "I am willing to stake my professional
</p>
<p>reputation at this stage of the case on the predic-
</p>
<p>tion that this murder of North is a conspiracy
</p>
<p>either for ruining Stackhouse or for revenge upon
</p>
<p>Paul North."
</p>
<p>" And the girl is in it ? " murmured Thomas,
</p>
<p>apprehensively.
</p>
<p>" Certainly, the girl is in it. To be sure the girl
</p>
<p>is in it. You can't alter that fact to save your life.
</p>
<p>For good, bad, or indifferent purposes Marion
</p>
<p>Stackhouse planned the game. Whose hand car-
</p>
<p>ried it out I wont say at this time ; but I am con-
</p>
<p>vinced of one thing it originated in her mind."
</p>
<p>" Why, John Lamm? Why ?" demanded Thomas,
</p>
<p>aghast.
</p>
<p>" Because I always look to the character of the
</p>
<p>person to correspond to the nature of the crime.

<p>There is nobody else in this little coterie capable
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY! 215
</p>
<p>of originating a crime, so cunningly conceived, so
</p>
<p>admirably executed."
</p>
<p>" What do you mean ?"
</p>
<p>" What do I mean ! " asked the detective.
</p>
<p>"Good heavens, Thomas, where are your eyes?
</p>
<p>Can't you see that in every step we have taken we
</p>
<p>have been baffled, misled, made fools of ? Do you
</p>
<p>imagine Paul North would have gone to his town
</p>
<p>house, shut up as it was for the summer, unless he
</p>
<p>had been enticed there ? The writing of Stack-
</p>
<p>house's name on the wall proves conclusively to
</p>
<p>my mind that Stackhouse did not do it. Why, how
</p>
<p>absurd it is ! The medical examiner gives 180
</p>
<p>seconds as a limit to North's life after he was shot.
</p>
<p>Do you suppose if Stackhouse had shot him he
</p>
<p>would have run away before assuring himself that
</p>
<p>he was dead ? Would he have let North write his
</p>
<p>name on the wall ? If North had done it, wouldn't
</p>
<p>he have smeared it out again ? W T hy, of course he
</p>
<p>would. And in this name upon the wall is the
</p>
<p>animus of the whole matter. There we see the
</p>
<p>fangs and the teeth of the serpent. The bitter,
</p>
<p>deadly emnity that underlies the whole scheme.
</p>
<p>That the entire object was revenge upon Stack-
</p>
<p>house I do not believe. It is too roundabout and
</p>
<p>too dangerous a method of revenge ; but that the
</p>
<p>perpetrators of the deed hated that man why, the
</p>
<p>fact is as clear as sunlight. Now, who hates Stack-
</p>

<p>crime drove him from her side, from the house,

</p>
<p>216 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>fact in so many words that such an act would only
</p>
<p>deepen the suspicion about him ? Who, with Paul
</p>
<p>North alive, was not free to meet the man she really
</p>
<p>loved ; and who, Paul North dead, and Stackhouse
</p>
<p>out of the way, might reunite herself with her

</p>
<p>under such circumstances we can understand, flies
</p>
<p>into a passion of anger at the remonstrance of an
</p>
<p>innocent girl, and is so excited by the impending
</p>
<p>crime that she cannot keep herself away from the
</p>
<p>scene ? "
</p>
<p>" Stop ! Don't go on ! "
</p>
<p>Thomas had risen and was holding up his hand.
</p>
<p>There was something horrible even to this veteran
</p>
<p>in the merciless arraignment of the sister of the
</p>
<p>woman he had protected. It might be true. John
</p>
<p>Lamm was the shrewdest of shrewd men ; but he
</p>
<p>would not believe it until he had all the proofs
</p>
<p>before him.
</p>
<p>" I tell you, Lamm," he declared, " I will not
</p>
<p>believe that woman planned that murder as long as
</p>
<p>there is a chance in the world for a reasonable
</p>
<p>doubt. And I can show "
</p>
<p>There was a rattle at the door-handle.
</p>
<p>" It's my man, Bill," said the detective, " back
</p>
<p>again from Swampscott."
</p>
<p>He unlocked the door.
</p>
<p>" And what has her ladyship to offer to-day ? "
</p>
<p>" This."

<p>hand. The detective broke the seal and read it
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY! 217
</p>
<p>eagerly. " See," he said, passing it to Thomas,
</p>
<p>" it's from my little parlor maid at Swampscott."
</p>
<p>The reporter perused the missive in his turn.
</p>
<p>With a little editing it would have read as fol-
</p>
<p>lows :
</p>
<p>" She is getting worse and worse. If this goes
</p>
<p>on much longer I can't stay here. Since Stella ran
</p>
<p>away she's acted stranger than ever. It wouldn't
</p>
<p>do to speak to her for your life. Mr. Fetridge
</p>
<p>called last night again. Their talk was short. She
</p>
<p>got a letter from her husband last night. I brought
</p>
<p>it from the post-office, and know his S's. She
</p>
<p>spent all the evening, I think, writing, for her room
</p>
<p>was full of tiny scraps, written on, this morning ;
</p>
<p>but she must have torn them all up, for no letter
</p>
<p>has been posted from this house ; that's certain.
</p>
<p>I'm crazy to know if that poor girl has been heard
</p>
<p>from. Don't keep the news from me, as soon as
</p>
<p>she is found. I think Stella's going has scared
</p>
<p>M. She looks like a ghost, and I'm afraid of her,
</p>
<p>and so are all the rest."
</p>
<p>" It's evident she tried to answer the letter
</p>
<p>Stackhouse wrote her," said Thomas. " Some-
</p>
<p>thing must have thrown her into an unusual state
</p>
<p>of indecision." John Lamm's comments were
</p>
<p>entirely mental. He only remarked that he had
</p>
<p>a deal of work before him. Before setting out,
</p>
<p>however, on his new quests, the detective took a
</p>
<p>decided notion that he wanted to be introduced to
</p>
<p>Stella, with whom he had never been given an

<p>opportunity to talk. Thomas was delighted at the
</p>
<p>2l8 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>chance of converting his friend wholly to the cause
</p>
<p>of the unfortunate girl, as he was sure a visit to
</p>
<p>her would do. So the two men were soon in the
</p>
<p>horse-cars, on their way to the reporter's home.
</p>
<p>Thomas led Lamm to a little room in the second
</p>
<p>story, where his mother a delightful lady with a
</p>
<p>sweet voice and a face a little faded and worn with
</p>
<p>the cares of fifty years, but brimming full of good
</p>
<p>will and sympathy of a heart that the years had
</p>
<p>failed to harden is seated at her knitting. The
</p>
<p>old lady takes off her spectacles, and is delighted to
</p>
<p>meet any friend of her son, whom it is easy to see
</p>
<p>she has placed in a niche far above the ordinary walks
</p>
<p>of mankind. She drops a little courtesy, and when
</p>
<p>her son whispers in her ear, becomes brimful of
</p>
<p>importance and mystery. Going to the door of
</p>
<p>the adjoining chamber her own room she says
</p>
<p>something in a low voice. There is a rustle of a
</p>
<p>woman's dress, and Stella North appears on the
</p>
<p>threshold. Pale and haunted by a cruel fear such
</p>
<p>as never troubled her young life before, she is,
</p>
<p>nevertheless, so much her old self that her eyes
</p>
<p>seem ready to laugh again, and the dimples to in-
</p>
<p>dent themselves in her pretty cheeks, if sufficient
</p>
<p>encouragement is given for her roguish smile.
</p>
<p>Alas, poor child! Her accustomed mirth had
</p>
<p>been a stranger to her for some time ; and the
</p>
<p>laughing face that nature had given her was only a
</p>
<p>cruel mockery. It was useless for John Lamm to
</p>
<p>ask himself whether she were part and parcel of

</p>
<p>the murderous conspiracy which he suspected.
</p>
<p>CONSPIRACY! 219
</p>
<p>The refutation of all doubt was written in her clear
</p>
<p>blue eyes, her timid shrinking from a stranger, her
</p>
<p>honest, roguish face.
</p>
<p>Why, that girl was meant for the open air and
</p>
<p>the sunshine, to sing, to love, to be happy, he
</p>
<p>thought. It is an incongruous hardship that a
</p>
<p>tragedy like this should come into her life. She is
</p>
<p>as out of place as a gay soubrette in the family of
</p>
<p>Lady Macbeth !
</p>
<p>But when she spoke, when, encouraged by the
</p>
<p>ready tact of Thomas, she was led to take part in
</p>
<p>the pleasant conversation that ensued Thomas
</p>
<p>had expressly stipulated that no reference should
</p>
<p>be made to the tragedy why, then John Lamm
</p>
<p>could not restrain his honest admiration and his
</p>
<p>cordial sympathy. A creature at once so frank, so
</p>
<p>free, so shy and so bold, so modest and so reck-
</p>
<p>less, in a breath, was enough to disarm the most
</p>
<p>severe of critics. And the detective pronounced
</p>
<p>her the beau ideal of an innocent, mischievous,
</p>
<p>light-hearted girl, not too shallow to love, but
</p>
<p>altogether too sunny to hate.
</p>
<p>But, more than all, he noted the half-abashed,
</p>
<p>half-reverential air with which she regarded her
</p>
<p>guardian Thomas ; and the peculiar solicitous,
</p>
<p>respectful, and protecting manner which he ex-
</p>
<p>hibited toward her.
</p>
<p>" Well, well," sighed Lamm, as he walked away,
</p>
<p>" there is one outcome to the North case which I
</p>
<p>feel perfectly safe in predicting at the present

<p>match ! To think that Thomas should meet his

<p>fate under such circumstances ! Well, well ! I

</p>
<p>And John Lamm hastened back to resume the
</p>
<p>dropped thread of the case which was intensifying
</p>
<p>in interest with every hour of investigation.
</p>
<p>" If I am right," he muttered, " I shall soon find
</p>
<p>that Richard Fetridge and that curious woman
</p>
<p>were in that house together."

<p>He went direct to his inner office and sat down

</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVII.
</p>
<p>FETRIDGE IS STILL RETICENT.
</p>
<p>R. LAMM had hardly got comfortably settled
</p>
<p>in his chair, and was meditating a look over
</p>
<p>the Public Statues to freshen his memory on a cer-
</p>
<p>tain point, when his familiar announced that Mr.
</p>
<p>Thornton Stackhouse was in waiting.
</p>
<p>The broker showed in his care-furrowed face
</p>
<p>something of the effect of the strain he had been
</p>
<p>under; but until he was alone with the detective he
</p>
<p>maintained much of his accustomed decision of
</p>
<p>manner. Then he made no further effort to con-
</p>
<p>ceal his anxiety.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Lamm," he said, eagerly bending over the
</p>
<p>table and tapping it with nervous fingers, " this
</p>
<p>strain is becoming greater than I can endure, and I
</p>
<p>want your best advice what to do."
</p>
<p>" You may command me," was the response,
</p>
<p>given in by no means an unfriendly tone. "But
</p>
<p>sit down, sit down, and talk about the matter
</p>
<p>calmly."
</p>
<p>" Calmly ! " Stackhouse smiled bitterly. " You
</p>
<p>do not know what I have to suffer, man. The
</p>
<p>failure is bad enough ; the distrust of me I see on
</p>
<p>every hand is hard to endure ; but I could stand

</p>
<p>up against everything if I did not have trouble at
</p>
<p>home."
</p>
<p>There was a break in the man's tone, but
</p>
<p>he controlled himself in a moment, though he
</p>
<p>studiously avoided meeting Mr. Lamm's steadfast
</p>
<p>look.
</p>
<p>" My wife and I have had serious trouble. I
</p>
<p>cannot live here under all these burdens."
</p>
<p>"Women are odd sometimes," said Lamm, " but
</p>
<p>almost all of them have some weak spot through
</p>
<p>acquaintance with which they may be managed. It
</p>
<p>ought to be possible to effect a reconciliation with
</p>
<p>your wife. Excuse me for speaking thus plainly,
</p>
<p>Mr. Stackhouse."
</p>
<p>"You know neither the woman nor the cause of
</p>
<p>the trouble," returned Stackhouse hurriedly.
</p>
<p>" However, this was not the subject I came here to
</p>
<p>discuss."
</p>
<p>" How can I assist you, Mr. Stackhouse ? Com-
</p>
<p>mand me."
</p>
<p>" Mr. Lamm, I have every reason to believe that
</p>
<p>my steps are dogged : that all my actions are spied
</p>
<p>upon. If I go in the streets after dark, there is a
</p>
<p>man always just at my elbow. If I make any sud-
</p>
<p>den movement in the daytime, somebody starts into
</p>
<p>life in an unexpected quarter, and is directly upon
</p>
<p>my heels. This morning I opened a letter. As I
</p>
<p>stood still to read it, I became aware that a face
</p>
<p>was peering over my shoulder. I turned suddenly,
</p>
<p>but the man was quite as quick, and passed on

</p>
<p>without looking at me. But I was well aware that
</p>
<p>FETRIDGE IS STILL RETICENT. 223
</p>
<p>I did not now see him for the first time. All of
</p>
<p>which leads me to believe that I am watched."
</p>
<p>"A logical conclusion, Mr. Stackhouse."
</p>
<p>"Well, then," said Stackhouse nervously, *' what
</p>
<p>I came to ask you was this : Suppose I wanted to do
</p>
<p>so, what do you think of the possibility of my get-
</p>
<p>ting quietly out of town ?"
</p>
<p>The detective's warning finger was uplifted in
</p>
<p>an instant.
</p>
<p>" Don't go," pronounced Mr. Lamm, decisively.
</p>
<p>" By no means try to leave Boston."
</p>
<p>" You mean it would be of no use for me to
</p>
<p>try," rejoined Stackhouse dejectedly. " I know I
</p>
<p>am being dogged constantly, but with your help, I
</p>
<p>thought "
</p>
<p>" There would be no trouble in giving the slip to
</p>
<p>the men who follow you about," said Mr. Lamm.
</p>
<p>" You could get away from Boston easily enough.
</p>
<p>But you would be stopped by telegraph before you
</p>
<p>had gone forty miles. Come, Mr. Stackhouse, give
</p>
<p>up the idea of flight. It isn't like you to think of
</p>
<p>it. Stay here and fight your trouble out, man
</p>
<p>fashion, saying nothing, keeping quietly about your
</p>
<p>business. You must not embarrass me, for one
</p>
<p>thing. I am running down the guilty party, I verily
</p>
<p>believe."
</p>
<p>Stackhouse rose, clutching the table with both
</p>
<p>hands.
</p>
<p>" You mean it ? " he said hoarsely.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamrn nodded with perfect assurance.

</p>
<p>" I do mean it, Mr. Stackhouse. Now you have
</p>

</p>
<p>retained me in this case, don't spoil my work by an
</p>
<p>attempt to run away. It would not only have a
</p>
<p>very bad appearance, but sadly interfere with my
</p>
<p>plans. Stand firm. I know you are having a great
</p>
<p>deal to contend with ; but it will only make matters
</p>
<p>worse to well, suppose we say change your base
</p>
<p>of operations. Come ! Promise me that you'll
</p>
<p>quietly stay here in Boston until, at least, the North
</p>
<p>case ceases to be a mystery."
</p>
<p>The detective's hand was stretched out as he
</p>
<p>spoke, and soon encircled Mr. Stackhouse's palm.
</p>
<p>The warm grip seemed to put new courage into the
</p>
<p>man, and as he thanked Mr. Lamm and went out,
</p>
<p>he seemed more like the junior partner of North &
</p>
<p>Stackhouse, in their most flourishing days, than he
</p>
<p>had been for many a day.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm listened to the retreating footstep,
</p>
<p>and felicited himself in having done at least one
</p>
<p>piece of good work.
</p>
<p>" I can't conscientiously say," he remarked to his
</p>
<p>reflection in the looking-glass, " that I enjoy being
</p>
<p>retained by quite so many people in one case.
</p>
<p>Before this time I expected to be able to resign
</p>
<p>from one or the other ; but I don't seem to be quite
</p>
<p>able to make up my mind. What with Kingman's
</p>
<p>protigtc and this luckless man Stackhouse, I have
</p>
<p>quite enough to occupy my mind and thought.
</p>
<p>But now for that Apollo whom I suspect."
</p>
<p>Mr. Richard Fetridge was found in his quiet
</p>
<p>little office in anything but a reposeful state of mind,

</p>
<p>and his books and papers were in great disorder.
</p>
<p>FETRIDGE IS STILL RETICENT. 225
</p>
<p>" Good afternoon, Mr. Lamm," said Mr. Fet-
</p>
<p>ridge. " Excuse the looks of the room, and find a
</p>
<p>chair for yourself, if you can. I've just been clear-
</p>
<p>ing up my Nicaragua Midland account. A tidy
</p>
<p>sum I've dropped into that swindle. It's not
</p>
<p>the money I care about, but the being taken in
</p>
<p>so shamefully. North & Stackhouse, indeed !
</p>
<p>A nice mess that rascally junior partner has made
</p>
<p>of it."
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm acquiesced in look, but not in words,
</p>
<p>and then began to question his companion about
</p>
<p>the details of the failure and its extent.
</p>
<p>" The creditors wont get ten cents on a dollar,
</p>
<p>sir."
</p>
<p>Richard Fetridge had repeated these words with
</p>
<p>much emphasis, when a little dried-up clerk, who
</p>
<p>had been holding an animated conversation in an
</p>
<p>undertone with some one in the passage, came up
</p>
<p>with an apologetic air.
</p>
<p>" Well, what's the matter, Olsen ? " queried Fet-
</p>
<p>ridge, rather irritably.
</p>
<p>" Man at the door," answered the clerk. " Wont
</p>
<p>go away. Says he must see you. Very important
</p>
<p>business."
</p>
<p>" What sort of looking man ? " asked the em-
</p>
<p>ployer.
</p>
<p>" Rather disreputable, sir. Been drinking, should
</p>
<p>say, but seems really to have business."
</p>
<p>As if by way of emphasizing unmistakably Mr.
</p>
<p>Olsen's half-whispered words, an unkempt head,

</p>
<p>with watery eyes, peered in through the doorway.
</p>
<p>226 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm looked at him with mild curiosity,
</p>
<p>while Mr. Fetridge gave a start of recognition.
</p>
<p>" Good-day, sir," said a shambling figure that
</p>
<p>little by little gained a foothold within the room.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Fetridge, good-day, sir. I hope you are well,
</p>
<p>sir."
</p>
<p>Without awaiting an answer to these salutations,
</p>
<p>delivered in rather a thick voice, Mr. Fetridge mo-
</p>
<p>tioned the clerk aside, and said to the detective
</p>
<p>under his breath
</p>
<p>" Just go into the inside office yonder a moment.
</p>
<p>I suppose I must see this fellow ; but I'll not be
</p>
<p>long."
</p>
<p>Inwardly wondering, Mr. Lamm suffered himself
</p>
<p>to be introduced into a little room with a window
</p>
<p>opening out upon a wall, and furnished with two
</p>
<p>chairs, a deal table, and several rows of shelves
</p>
<p>occupied by dusty books.
</p>
<p>There was a fan-light over the door that gave
</p>
<p>access to the larger office. Thus much the detec-
</p>
<p>tive knew at first glance.
</p>
<p>" I must use that fan-light," he said to himself.
</p>
<p>"This proceeding of Fetridge is very curious. It
</p>
<p>may be only one of his whims he's a notional man,
</p>
<p>I can see. But at any rate, it will do no harm to
</p>
<p>watch the interview. What can a well-to-do man
</p>
<p>like Fetridge have in common with a fellow like
</p>
<p>that ? "
</p>
<p>As Mr. Lamm asked himself the question he
</p>
<p>noiselessly brought a chair to the door, and followed

<p>several books. By the aid of this device the detec-
</p>
<p>tive found himself able to look through the fan-light
</p>
<p>unobserved, and soon realized that he could hear
</p>
<p>as well as see.
</p>
<p>The unkempt head was unpleasantly near Mr.
</p>
<p>Fetridge, as Mr. Lamm looked in, and the expres-
</p>
<p>sion of disgust on Mr. Fetridge's countenance left
</p>
<p>no room to doubt that he fully realized the fact.
</p>
<p>" I wan' ten doll'rs, an' I wan' it now," remarked
</p>
<p>the caller, thickly, but emphatically.
</p>
<p>" What do you mean ? " returned Fetridge, draw-
</p>
<p>ing away his arm. " Didn't you promise, on your
</p>
<p>honor, when I gave you the money last time that
</p>
<p>you wouldn't trouble me again ? "
</p>
<p>There was a cunning look in the bleared, red eyes.
</p>
<p>" I was half full and don* remember what I said,"
</p>
<p>he rejoined. " Don' care, anyway. I wan' that
</p>
<p>ten doll'rs, and I must have it ! "
</p>
<p>The visitor shook his trembling hand at Fetridge
</p>
<p>with an apology for a threat. Mr. Lamm, rather
</p>
<p>surprised, noticed that the business man did not
</p>
<p>openly resent his companion's tone, but stood there,
</p>
<p>evidently in much perplexity of mind.
</p>
<p>"Come," continued the tramp in louder tones.
</p>
<p>" You can't frighten me ! I know where you were
</p>
<p>that night don't forget that ! "
</p>
<p>Mr. Fetridge wheeled his importunate caller
</p>
<p>around and said, in apprehensive warning
</p>
<p>"Hush! Don't speak so loud! There are
</p>
<p>people within hearing ! "

<p>" Hand over, then," answered the man sullenly,
</p>
<p>228 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>" and make no more bones about the matter,
</p>
<p>either ! "
</p>
<p>As if fearful of some interruption, Fetridge put
</p>
<p>some money between the grimy fingers of his credi-
</p>
<p>tor and fairly pushed him out of the room amid
</p>
<p>some mutterings which the watcher at the fan-light
</p>
<p>could not overhear.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm had restored the books to the shelves
</p>
<p>and was sitting down, looking out into the well,
</p>
<p>when Fetridge opened the door of the little office.
</p>
<p>" Come in," he said ; " I've got rid of the fellow ;
</p>
<p>used to be a gardener on my place at Svvampscott,
</p>
<p>and I put up with his visits because he is really a
</p>
<p>capable man when not in liquor."
</p>
<p>John Lamm looked Richard Fetridge full in the
</p>
<p>face.
</p>
<p>" When I am in a gentleman's employ," he began,
</p>
<p>" I do not feel that I have done my full duty as
</p>
<p>confidential detective if I do not warn him when
</p>
<p>he is treading on dangerous ground."
</p>
<p>Richard Fetridge grew a little red in the face.
</p>
<p>" What do you mean ? " he asked, constrainedly.
</p>
<p>" I mean that when a gentleman situated as you
</p>
<p>are pays blackmail to a man who looks like a dirty
</p>
<p>tramp "
</p>
<p>Mr. Fetridge turned upon him hotly.
</p>
<p>" This is going too far, Mr. Lamm ; altogether
</p>
<p>too far. It is none of your business."
</p>
<p>" Pardon me," answered the detective very un-
</p>
<p>perturbably. " Under the circumstances, Mr. Fet-

<p>FETRIDGE IS STILL RETICENT. 229
</p>
<p>cally, that your giving money to this man here, just
</p>
<p>now, was a very ticklish and dangerous proceed-
</p>
<p>ing. You may ask how I know."
</p>
<p>" I do ask how you know," put in Mr. Fetridge,
</p>
<p>with anger and shame contending for the master}'.
</p>
<p>" It was dangerous, Mr. Fetridge, because you
</p>
<p>are one of the parties under surveillance in this
</p>
<p>matter of the murder of Paul North."
</p>
<p>"What?"
</p>
<p>" Don't get excited, sir. I am simply stating
</p>
<p>facts. You were the last person seen with Paul
</p>
<p>North, so far as the evidence in hand indicates.
</p>
<p>Consequently, until more is known about this phase
</p>
<p>of the case, you are under suspicion, to a certain
</p>
<p>extent. Whether you know it or not, sir, you have
</p>
<p>been watched almost constantly."
</p>
<p>" Watched ! " ejaculated Fetridge, now very pale.
</p>
<p>" Watched. By the police," pursued Mr. Lamm.
</p>
<p>" Now I have been frank with you, and you must
</p>
<p>be equally frank with me. How do you imagine
</p>
<p>my services as confidential detective can be of value
</p>
<p>to you, Mr. Fetridge, if you do not give me your
</p>
<p>entire confidence?"
</p>
<p>There was some answer on Mr. Fetridge's lips,
</p>
<p>but he could not seem to give it utterance.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm pursued his advantage steadily.
</p>
<p>" Let me ask you one question. You paid black-
</p>
<p>mail to that man because he knew that you had an
</p>
<p>interview with Paul North at his house the night of
</p>
<p>the murder. Am I not right ?"

</p>
<p>" I beg your pardon," he exclaimed, " but you
</p>
<p>misapprehend the state of the case, Mr. Lamm. I
</p>
<p>did not pay the man because I feared to have the
</p>
<p>truth known on my account. I have kept silent on

<p>the subject simply out of respect for the feelings of

</p>
<p>Somewhat enigmatical and unsatisfactory Mr.

<p>comment, and continued his questioning.
</p>
<p>" If this is not a case of blackmail, Mr. Fetridge,
</p>
<p>why did you pay this man money ? Do you mean
</p>
<p>to say you were not at Paul North's house that
</p>
<p>night ?"
</p>
<p>Mr. Fetridge by this time had regained his com-
</p>
<p>posure.
</p>
<p>" I have no hesitation in saying to you that I
</p>
<p>was at his house that night," he answered.
</p>
<p>The detective's face grew dark.
</p>
<p>" Why did you not tell me this ? Why did you
</p>
<p>not make the fact known to the police ? "
</p>
<p>" For the simple reason that the police have not
</p>
<p>asked me."
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm took an impatient step or two around
</p>
<p>the room.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Fetridge, you are an enigma," he resumed,
</p>
<p>rather sharply. " Perhaps you will be good enough
</p>
<p>to explain why you permitted the public to have
</p>
<p>the impression that you parted with Paul North for
</p>
<p>the last time the afternoon before the murder at
</p>
<p>the Old State House ? "

<p>been put out of the way when I made that state-
</p>
<p>ment at the directors' meeting," Mr. Fetridge ex-
</p>
<p>plained. " Besides, Stackhouse was there. I would
</p>
<p>not have let him know of my private conference
</p>
<p>with Mr. North for a great deal. And since the
</p>
<p>crime came out, I have been living in hope that
</p>
<p>you would discover the facts in season for me to
</p>
<p>keep out of any possible connection with the affair.
</p>
<p>I should have told you about it ; I realize it now.
</p>
<p>But what's past is past."
</p>
<p>Mr. Fetridge sat down resignedly.
</p>
<p>" Why did you go to Mr. North's that evening ? "
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm questioned, now quite unmoved, so far
</p>
<p>as outward appearance was concerned.
</p>
<p>" To discuss a business matter."
</p>
<p>" A queer place ! " Mr. Lamm spoke in a sig-
</p>
<p>nificant tone.
</p>
<p>" You think so ? Yet I had peculiar reasons,
</p>
<p>and I accounted them weighty reasons, for meet-
</p>
<p>ing Mr. North at his house. My business was con-
</p>
<p>fidential, and could not be done at the office or in
</p>
<p>any place so well as at the house in Marlboro
</p>
<p>Street."
</p>
<p>" Mr. North's partner was not a party to the busi-
</p>
<p>ness in hand ?"
</p>
<p>Fetridge's eyes flashed angrily.
</p>
<p>" It would have been well if he had not been a
</p>
<p>party to any of North & Stackhouse's business," he
</p>
<p>said, with some bitterness of tone. " But this was
</p>
<p>a special matter. How important it was you may

<p>judge from this fact that if Stackhouse had found
</p>
<p>232 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>out that North was possessed of the information I
</p>
<p>gave him, and did not know that I knew it also, he
</p>
<p>would have had an ample motive for committing the
</p>
<p>crime of which I believe him guilty."
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm looked at him curiously.
</p>
<p>" And you still wish to keep the subject of your
</p>
<p>last conversation a secret, even from me ? "
</p>
<p>" Even from you," responded Fetridge obsti-
</p>
<p>nately. " I must await developments, and I hope
</p>
<p>those developments will preclude the necessity of
</p>
<p>my speaking about the matter at all."
</p>
<p>" Bear in mind what I said to you just now about
</p>
<p>surveillance." Mr. Lamm spoke gravely. " You
</p>
<p>are liable to arrest at any time."
</p>
<p>Fetridge gave an incredulous laugh.
</p>
<p>" I don't think they'll arrest me," Fetridge an-
</p>
<p>swered lightly. Then, in a more serious tone,
</p>
<p>" One thing I'll tell you, Mr. Lamm. To the best
</p>
<p>of my knowledge and belief Stackhouse was in
</p>
<p>Paul North's house that night."
</p>
<p>" Something more than knowledge and belief
</p>
<p>is requisite evidence," responded Mr. Lamm,
</p>
<p>rather drily. " There's much in this whole busi-
</p>
<p>ness that concerns you closely more closely,
</p>
<p>perhaps, than you think. At what time did you
</p>
<p>leave Paul North's house in Marlboro Street
</p>
<p>that night ? "
</p>
<p>" Between half-past eight and a quarter to nine."
</p>
<p>" Was there any one in the street or near by, so
</p>
<p>far as you know ? "

</p>
<p>" No one. But I had not gone far when this
</p>
<p>FETRIDGE IS STILL RETICENT. 233
</p>
<p>fellow who was here just now touched me on the
</p>
<p>shoulder. I turned round and recognized him."
</p>
<p>" Oho ! You know him, then ? "
</p>
<p>" Why, yes. He used to be head clerk in North
</p>
<p>& Stackhouse's office : got to speculating ; was
</p>
<p>pinched in Nicaragua Midland ; lost his little all ;
</p>
<p>took to drink and so forth. I pitied the fellow,
</p>
<p>knowing how he came to be down in the world, and
</p>
<p>occasionally gave him a little to help him along."
</p>
<p>" He wanted money that night, of course ? "
</p>
<p>" Of course. I didn't fancy his having met me
</p>
<p>at such a time and place, and as I handed him the
</p>
<p>five-dollar note I bade him not mention having
</p>
<p>seen me. He readily agreed, and then started off
</p>
<p>in a hurry. To meet some one round the corner,
</p>
<p>I suppose." And Mr. Fetridge sighed.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm pursed his lips together. "And since
</p>
<p>then the fellow has been hunting you for more
</p>
<p>money."
</p>
<p>"That's about the state of the case," answered
</p>
<p>Fetridge, rather reluctantly. " You understand, I
</p>
<p>thought it was cheaper to buy the man's silence,
</p>
<p>being sure that a few days would clear up the whole
</p>
<p>matter."
</p>
<p>The detective shook his head. " Very risky
</p>
<p>business, sir. But never mind that now. A few
</p>
<p>moments ago you said something about believing
</p>
<p>Stackhouse had been at North's house that night.
</p>
<p>Why ? "
</p>
<p>" Why ? " returned Fetridge. " The outer door

<p>the storm door was unlocked when we came there.
</p>

</p>
<p>Mr. North himself called my attention to the fact.
</p>
<p>' Hullo,' he said, ' Thornton is here probably.' I
</p>
<p>knew it would never do to have that man overhear
</p>
<p>our conversation, and we searched the house high
</p>
<p>and low. Finally I was convinced that, though
</p>
<p>Stackhouse may have been there, he had gone away
</p>
<p>again. The idea that he might come back that
</p>
<p>night never entered my head. But I have no doubt
</p>
<p>whatever now that he did come back, and that
</p>
<p>Thornton Stackhouse was the last person who saw
</p>
<p>Paul North alive."
</p>
<p>" Indeed ! Well then, Mr. Fetridge, I must re-
</p>
<p>quest a reply to a question I asked you once before.
</p>
<p>What connection has this Creole woman, Marie
</p>
<p>Moissot, with the case ? "
</p>
<p>Fetridge started.
</p>
<p>" You told me once, I believe, that the medical
</p>
<p>examiner says that the murder was committed in
</p>
<p>the first part of the evening?"
</p>
<p>"I did, sir."
</p>
<p>" Thank you. I wanted to be sure.'
</p>
<p>" But what has this to do with the Creole ? "
</p>
<p>Lamm asked with some impatience.
</p>
<p>" Oh," returned Fetridge, with an unsuccessful
</p>
<p>assumption of carelessness, " I forgot. Excuse
</p>
<p>me. My mind wandered from the subject. The
</p>
<p>Creole woman ? She has no connection with the
</p>
<p>murder. That is quite impossible."
</p>
<p>" Then once more I ask you, plainly, who is
</p>
<p>she?"

</p>
<p>" Well, then, plainly, sir, I .will answer you. She

<p>FETRIDGE IS STILL RETICENT. 235
</p>
<p>was a foolish girl who believed too readily in Stack-
</p>
<p>house. He parted from her and went on, and she,
</p>
<p>I suppose, had to suffer for her credulity. But this
</p>
<p>was ten years ago, and he has doubtless forgotten
</p>
<p>her."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! Well, this brings me to another question.
</p>
<p>How comes Marion Stackhouse to know of the
</p>
<p>existence of this woman ? "
</p>
<p>" Good heavens ! " exclaimed Fetridge excitedly.
</p>
<p>" She does not, does she ? "
</p>
<p>"I think she does," said Lamm dreamily. " But
</p>
<p>passing that, since you do not know, we come to
</p>
<p>question No. 2. Why does Marion Stackhouse
</p>
<p>refuse to live with her husband since the murder?"
</p>
<p>Fetridge flushed.
</p>
<p>" You will persist, Mr. Lamm, for some strange
</p>
<p>reason, in assuming me to be in Mrs. Stackhouse's
</p>
<p>confidence."
</p>
<p>" I know that you are a friend of the family,"
</p>
<p>said the detective calmly.
</p>
<p>" Very well," said Fetridge, " I give you my word
</p>
<p>of honor that I am not in that lady's confidence.
</p>
<p>I have urged her to tell me her reasons. She
</p>
<p>declines to do it. I can only guess at them. Her
</p>
<p>conduct is significant enough to me that she has by
</p>
<p>some means become possessed of evidence against
</p>
<p>her husband. But what wife would acknowledge
</p>
<p>such a fact ? "
</p>
<p>"Ah ! " was Mr. Lamm's only reply to this inter-

</p>
<p>characteristic grunt, which was even more than
</p>
<p>non-committal.
</p>
<p>" By the way," said Mr. Lamm, as he rose to go,
</p>
<p>" I suppose I ought to tell you that press of other
</p>
<p>business is liable to cause me to drop your work at
</p>
<p>short notice, Mr. Fetridge. I had no idea, when I
</p>
<p>took the case, that it would last so long."
</p>
<p>" I hope not," said Fetridge earnestly.
</p>
<p>" I hope not, too," returned Mr. Lamm ; " but I
</p>
<p>must say the case looks dubious at the present time.
</p>
<p>However, I'll let you know definitely very soon."

<p>he went down the stairs. " It is not at all improb-

</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVIII.
</p>
<p>MADAME RAYMOND.
</p>
<p>JOHN LAMM, confident that a conspiracy was
</p>
<p>I to be found at the bottom of the North case,
</p>
<p>was reasonably sure already of two parties there-
</p>
<p>to Marion Stackhouse and Richard Fetridge.
</p>
<p>Whether there was anybody else concerned he had
</p>
<p>not yet made up his mind. The plain yet puzzling
</p>
<p>charge of Thornton Stackhouse in the letter to the
</p>
<p>Moissot woman, who seemed to the detective to
</p>
<p>have been created for the express purpose of
</p>
<p>tantalizing him with the enigma of her existence,
</p>
<p>indicated that Stackhouse himself had reason to
</p>
<p>believe her the head and front of all offense.
</p>
<p>Again and again John Lamm studied that letter,
</p>
<p>endeavoring to squeeze out of it the last drop of
</p>
<p>possible significance ; but the writer had so well
</p>
<p>chosen his words, with the evident purpose of
</p>
<p>making them unintelligible to a third person, that
</p>
<p>the detective was suspicious of what seemed the
</p>
<p>logical deductions therefrom. One thing was cer-
</p>
<p>tain. Stackhouse charged Marie Moissot (the
</p>
<p>" person unknown " of Mr. Lamm's notes) with
</p>
<p>having carried to successful issue, on the i6th of
</p>
<p>June, a conspiracy to ruin him, and Mr. Lamm be-

</p>
<p>lieved himself fully possessed of the unfortunate
</p>
<p>events which had overwhelmed this man during
</p>
<p>that day. The discovery of this unique charge of
</p>
<p>murder written in red on the wall of North's library,
</p>
<p>he did not forget was not the only misfortune.
</p>
<p>The extraordinary conduct of his wife was quite as
</p>
<p>serious to Stackhouse, not impossibly more so than
</p>
<p>this implied accusation. To be sure, these two
</p>
<p>conspicuous facts seemed to be part and parcel of
</p>
<p>one larger fact, and perhaps appeared to Mr.
</p>
<p>Stackhouse's mind as one thing ; but the detective
</p>
<p>was altogether too cautious not to have seen that
</p>
<p>the letter might refer to either one of these calami-
</p>
<p>ties. The problem in John Lamm's mind, there-
</p>
<p>fore, stood in this wise :
</p>
<p>Q. Does Mr. Stackhouse hold Marie Moissot
</p>
<p>responsible for implicating him in the murder of
</p>
<p>his partner or in embittering his domestic rela-
</p>
<p>tions ?
</p>
<p>Q. If the former were his belief, would he not
</p>
<p>have acquainted me with the fact ?
</p>
<p>And as Mr. Lamm could not help answering the
</p>
<p>latter question in the affirmative, he was still reason-
</p>
<p>ably sure that there was no evidence in his pos-
</p>
<p>session of a third party to the great " conspiracy "
</p>
<p>which was so puzzling him.
</p>
<p>Whence it seemed to be plain that his present
</p>
<p>duty was to center his efforts upon the two people
</p>
<p>whom he suspected to investigate their doings
</p>
<p>thoroughly, to watch both of them with all possible

<p>vigilance.
</p>
<p>MADAME RA YMOND. 239
</p>
<p>To keep Marion Stackhouse under surveillance
</p>
<p>was a comparatively easy task. She had not left
</p>
<p>the confines of the North estate, except on the
</p>
<p>occasion of the funeral, since the discovery of her
</p>
<p>father's death ; and for a full report of her con-
</p>
<p>duct for the immediate present Lamm felt he could
</p>
<p>safely rely on the vigilance of Moffett and Mollie
</p>
<p>White. But the movements of Richard Fetridge
</p>
<p>were not so easily followed. Consequently, John
</p>
<p>Lamm did not dare to trust this apparently most
</p>
<p>important task to anybody but himself and those
</p>
<p>under his active supervision.
</p>
<p>On the Wednesday when he received Thomas's
</p>
<p>confidence in the Stella North affair, Lamm re-
</p>
<p>doubled the safeguards and precautions previously
</p>
<p>taken to assure himself of the integrity of Richard
</p>
<p>Fetridge. Not that he ignored other possibilities
</p>
<p>of investigation. Into the past lives of Stackhouse
</p>
<p>and North and Marion he was already instituting
</p>
<p>the most careful inquiries ; but Fetridge's career
</p>
<p>interested him still more. With that affable good
</p>
<p>fellowship which made it possible for him to make
</p>
<p>friends with all sorts and conditions of men, he
</p>
<p>insinuated himself into the good graces of Fet-
</p>
<p>ridge's clerk, and hearing that Olsen had a prede-
</p>
<p>cessor who had been discharged for taking too
</p>
<p>much interest in his employer's affairs, he hunted
</p>
<p>up that man, with what degree of reward will be
</p>
<p>hereafter recorded.
</p>
<p>He soon discovered that Mr. Fetridge had ceased

</p>
<p>but few clients, and that his chief business now
</p>
<p>seemed to be to look after the investments of his
</p>
<p>large property. John Lamm made arrangements to
</p>
<p>be accurately informed from day to day of a full list
</p>
<p>of the millionaire's office visitors, especially of those
</p>
<p>whom he took into his inner sanctum, and whose
</p>
<p>business with him appeared to be confidential.
</p>
<p>It was in this way that he first became informed
</p>
<p>of the existence of Madame Raymond.
</p>
<p>Here is the report furnished by Richard Fet-
</p>
<p>ridge's clerk, Olsen, late in the afternoon of Thurs-
</p>
<p>day :
</p>
<p>" About three o'clock, a mighty pretty woman,
</p>
<p>whose complexion had evidently been toned up by
</p>
<p>artificial expedients, asked, in a tone of authority, if
</p>
<p>Mr. Fetridge was in. I said ' No' ; but she might
</p>
<p>expect him in a few minutes. Would she sit down
</p>
<p>and wait ? She would. She drew her chair up
</p>
<p>near the window, and looked out all the time. It
</p>
<p>struck me she was careful not to turn round when
</p>
<p>anybody came in. I may be wrong, but it occurred
</p>
<p>to me that she did this so as not to let her face be
</p>
<p>seen by any chance visitor.
</p>
<p>" It was something like thirty minutes before the
</p>
<p>boss appeared. As soon as she heard his voice she
</p>
<p>turned round. The boss gave a start. 'Why,
</p>
<p>Madame Raymond/ he said, and surprised enough
</p>
<p>he was. But he hurried her toward his private
</p>
<p>office, saying something in a low tone, and looking
</p>
<p>over in my direction. But you may believe I was

<p>adding up a column of figures just at that time.
</p>
<p>MADAME RA YMOND. 241
</p>
<p>" Well, the two were closeted an hour together,
</p>
<p>and then the woman came out. Always the
</p>
<p>politest of men is my boss when a good-looking
</p>
<p>face is about. He danced attendance on her,
</p>
<p>and I heard him say, as he took her hand at
</p>
<p>the door :
</p>
<p>" ' Have no anxiety, my dear madam. Every-
</p>
<p>thing is being carefully looked after. Trust me to
</p>
<p>see that all comes out right.'
</p>
<p>" And that was the last I saw of the woman."
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm, with all his eagerness to get at the
</p>
<p>case only intensified by these incomplete and un-
</p>
<p>satisfactory disclosures, requested his informant
</p>
<p>to let him know the instant that unknown woman
</p>
<p>appeared in Fetridge's office again.
</p>
<p>He was prepared for an indefinite period of
</p>
<p>waiting, and the arrival of this brief message the
</p>
<p>morning of the day after he had given these last
</p>
<p>instructions, came as a pleasant surprise :
</p>
<p>" She is here."
</p>
<p>With all speed the detective made his way towards
</p>
<p>the substantial brick building where Richard Fet-
</p>
<p>ridge was usually to be found during business
</p>
<p>hours on any week-day of the year.
</p>
<p>Waiting in the quiet corridor, Mr. Lamm found
</p>
<p>the place almost as deserted, this summer morning,
</p>
<p>as if it were a bank holiday. But the echo of a
</p>
<p>door closing on the flight above, and the sound of
</p>
<p>two voices, one of which was certainly Fetridge's,
</p>
<p>in amicable conversation, soon demanded his close

<p>It was a woman's voice that spoke the only

</p>
<p>the detective ; and a woman's light step heard on
</p>
<p>the stairway gave him assurance that the mysterious
</p>
<p>Madame Raymond was coming his way.
</p>
<p>A slight built, willowly woman, this, thought Mr.
</p>
<p>Lamm, as he watched her pass near at hand, his
</p>
<p>own presence entirely unoticed. Pretty, an olive
</p>
<p>complexion, a little too much " made up " ; large,
</p>
<p>lustrous eyes, black hair (her own undoubtedly), a
</p>
<p>very graceful figure. Altogether, as Mr. Lamm
</p>
<p>summed up the case, an attractive brunette on the
</p>
<p>sunny side of thirty, with something of a foreign
</p>
<p>air about her. Assuredly a visitor to Boston,
</p>
<p>wherever born and bred.
</p>
<p>The graceful figure, well set off by a coquettish
</p>
<p>bonnet, which, like the summer wrap, had a pleasant
</p>
<p>contrast of color in it, flitted through the streets.
</p>
<p>Followed by more than one admiring glance, the
</p>
<p>lady was followed also by Mr. Lamm, though not
</p>
<p>one of the many acquaintances with whom the
</p>
<p>detective exchanged a bow and a pleasant word
</p>
<p>would have suspected the fact.
</p>
<p>Madam Raymond, hailing a South End car and
</p>
<p>taking a seat with dainty supervision of her skirts,
</p>
<p>looked at the shop windows past which her route
</p>
<p>took her, with languid curiosity. Mr. Lamm, two
</p>
<p>seats behind, did not seem to notice her. Madame
</p>
<p>Raymond left the car at a shady crossing; and Mr.
</p>
<p>Lamm, having seen her on to the footpath and well

</p>
<p>and quite casually walked up the street which the
</p>
<p>lady had traversed just before.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm was going by a modest-looking house,
</p>
<p>with a high doorstep, just as Madame Raymond
</p>
<p>was ringing the bell. She was admitted in a
</p>
<p>moment, and Mr. Lamm still walked on, turning
</p>
<p>the corner and taking a meditative promenade
</p>
<p>down a dusty avenue for a little distance.
</p>
<p>But the now invisible magnet still drew him to
</p>
<p>that quiet little street and to the ninth house on the
</p>
<p>right in a distractingly regular row of highly-
</p>
<p>respectable looking dwellings. " A boarding-
</p>
<p>house," commented Mr. Lamm, as he leisurely
</p>
<p>looked at the windows on his way up the steps.
</p>
<p>" No need of a sign to tell that fact."
</p>
<p>In his suave inquiry regarding eligible lodgings,
</p>
<p>the careworn landlady who opened the door took
</p>
<p>an instant interest. She liked the man's face, as
</p>
<p>she confided an hour later to an intimate friend in
</p>
<p>the millinery line, who chanced to call.
</p>
<p>" We have a very good room back, up one flight,
</p>
<p>sir ; quite near the bathroom."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! " The caller seemed to be considering.
</p>
<p>"I'm a quiet man of business, you understand. No
</p>
<p>gay roysterers, no noisy lodgers, no piano thump-
</p>
<p>ing at midnight, I suppose ? "
</p>
<p>" Dear me, no, sir," the landlady assured him-
</p>
<p>" Fact is, we're rather empty now. Only two
</p>
<p>clerks, very nice, steady young men, on the third
</p>
<p>floor, and a transient, a lady, who occupies the

</p>
<p>" She's not musical ? "
</p>
<p>" I think not, sir. She's not sung since she
</p>
<p>came here, to my knowledge, a week ago last
</p>
<p>Wednesday, I think it was yes, I am sure, for
</p>
<p>the man was sent in to whiten the walls that
</p>
<p>day, and that is how I came to remember it."
</p>
<p>" Lady a transient, you say. Stranger, then, of
</p>
<p>course ? "
</p>
<p>" It's her first visit to Boston, she tells me. She
</p>
<p>lives in New York, and is here on a little business.
</p>
<p>Settling up an estate, I think, though she's not said
</p>
<p>so in just so many words."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! Well, in that case, she can't have many
</p>
<p>friends to call on her in the evening, and chatter,
</p>
<p>chatter, giggle, giggle for hours together ? "
</p>
<p>The landlady smiled and shook her head. Lamm
</p>
<p>resumed, in a very friendly, off-hand fashion.
</p>
<p>" You see, ma'am, I should be quite near her
</p>
<p>room if I concluded to come here, and as I'm a
</p>
<p>quiet man and go to bed early, I don't want to be
</p>
<p>kept awake by late and noisy callers or any other
</p>
<p>lodgers. That was the objection at my last place,
</p>
<p>ma'am."
</p>
<p>The landlady smoothed her apron complacently.
</p>
<p>" No such difficulty here, sir," she said with confi-
</p>
<p>dence. " Why, Madame Raymond has only had
</p>
<p>one caller since she's been here, and I don't know
</p>
<p>as you can call it a caller either, for he merely came
</p>
<p>home with her the evening of the day after the lady
</p>
<p>took the room here. Yes, it was Thursday week.

<p>her ring. It was after nine o'clock, and I had got
</p>
<p>worried about her, being a stranger and so on, so
</p>
<p>that I was very glad to see she had company. ' My
</p>
<p>brother,' she said to me, and a nice appearing gen-
</p>
<p>tleman he was. I liked his face. Well, he came in
</p>
<p>and had a quiet talk with the lady a talk that you
</p>
<p>couldn't hear an inch outside the room, and couldn't
</p>
<p>possibly disturb anybody. Madame Raymond has
</p>
<p>been out once or twice, but no one else has called
</p>
<p>on her, and I am sure that nothing she and the
</p>
<p>brother could say, if he should come to see her
</p>
<p>again, could possibly disturb you, sir."
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm was very far indeed from sharing this
</p>
<p>opinion of the lady who so desired his presence as
</p>
<p>a lodger. But his face wore a look of entire, unquali-
</p>
<p>fied assent. He asked to see the much-commended
</p>
<p>apartment " back, up one flight," approved its
</p>
<p>arrangements, and declared the price very reason-
</p>
<p>able.
</p>
<p>But the best guarantee of his satisfaction was
</p>
<p>that he actually decided to take the room at once.
</p>
<p>A week's rent in advance was deposited in the land-
</p>
<p>lady's willing hand. Mr. Lamm took a receipt for
</p>
<p>the money with a latchkey rolled up therewith, and,
</p>
<p>saying that he might come in to occupy the room
</p>
<p>at any time, bade the woman " good-day " and went
</p>
<p>toward his office, with thoughts in plenty to occupy
</p>
<p>his attention.

<p>He had quite made up his mind that it was high

</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIX.
</p>
<p>" SO LONG AS SHE LIVES I AM IN DANGER."
</p>
<p>ON his return to headquarters from some business
</p>
<p>in connection with the North case, Friday
</p>
<p>morning, a week after the discovery of the murder,
</p>
<p>Inspector Applebee found a genuine surprise
</p>
<p>awaiting him.
</p>
<p>" There is a lady in there who has been waiting
</p>
<p>to see you for some time," observed one of his
</p>
<p>assistants, and immediately after the inspector
</p>
<p>found himself closeted with the identical lady
</p>
<p>whose reception of him on a previous occasion had
</p>
<p>led him to denounce her to his superior as an
</p>
<p>idiotic and unavailable personage none other, in
</p>
<p>fact, than Aunt Comfort Hanvood.
</p>
<p>It is not probable that the good old lady recog-
</p>
<p>nized in Mr. Applebee the gentleman whom she
</p>
<p>supposed to have been in the gas or water business
</p>
<p>when he visited her at Swampscott.
</p>
<p>The chaotic condition of her mind at that time
</p>
<p>had been no more pronounced than her agitation
</p>
<p>and excitement on the present occasion.
</p>
<p>" Oh ! my dear Mr. Policeman," said Aunt Com-
</p>
<p>fort, hastening to open a little reticule which she
</p>
<p>carried at her side, as soon as her eyes fell on the

</p>
<p>inspector's portly form. " Oh ! my dear Mr. Po-
</p>
<p>liceman if you are the proper man yes, thank
</p>
<p>you I have found the most awful thing in the
</p>
<p>house, and, though Mrs. Stackhouse said it was all
</p>
<p>nonsense, I could not rest till I had brought it to
</p>
<p>you."
</p>
<p>" You come from Mr. North's, I believe ? " said
</p>
<p>the inspector. " You were his sister-in-law ? "
</p>
<p>" Yes, indeed, sir ; poor man ! And to think
</p>
<p>that he should have such frightful communications
</p>
<p>as this sent to him, and should keep them a secret
</p>
<p>from everybody in the house, when his own wife's
</p>
<p>sister but it is just like him ! He was so thought-
</p>
<p>ful of everybody except himself."
</p>
<p>She had already excitedly thrust in the inspector's
</p>
<p>hand an envelope, of which the seal was broken.
</p>
<p>A glance showed him that it was postmarked
</p>
<p>" Boston, May 10," of ihis same year, and that it
</p>
<p>was without any distinctive mark to betray its
</p>
<p>authorship. It was superscribed in a feminine
</p>
<p>hand," Paul, North, Esq., Marlboro Street, Boston,
</p>
<p>Mass." The envelope contained a sheet of com-
</p>
<p>mon notepaper, on which was written in the same
</p>
<p>chirography as that of the superscription, the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing:
</p>
<p>" MY DEAR SIR. Pardon the freedom of a complete
</p>
<p>stranger, but believe in me you have a well-wisher. It is I who
</p>
<p>should warn you against trusting fortune or character in the
</p>
<p>hands of Mr. Albert Runyon. At least before doing so, per-
</p>
<p>mit that I advise you to investigate the history of his past.

<p>STA CKHO USE 'S DANGERO US ENEM Y. 249
</p>
<p>everybody who in him confided, and will ruin you in the same
</p>
<p>way. I beg you will not treat this warning lightly, for if you
</p>
<p>disregard it you will surely come to grief sooner or later, and
</p>
<p>will remember when it is too late, my good advice. A word to
</p>
<p>the wise is sufficient. "A FRIEND."
</p>
<p>The inspector read this letter through twice very
</p>
<p>carefully before he uttered a word. Who was
</p>
<p>Albert Runyon ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Applebee was sure that he had never heard
</p>
<p>the name before.
</p>
<p>" Well," said the inspector, " you did very right
</p>
<p>to bring this to me. Where did you find it ? "
</p>
<p>Aunt Comfort explained after a deal of circum-
</p>
<p>locution, which it is unnecessary to reproduce, that
</p>
<p>she had accidentally come across it in examining
</p>
<p>some papers of her late brother-in-law, which until
</p>
<p>recently had reposed under lock and key in his
</p>
<p>writing desk at the Marlboro Street house.
</p>
<p>The inspector quieted her agitation by assuring
</p>
<p>her that she had done her full duty in immediately
</p>
<p>referring this matter to the police, and that they
</p>
<p>would take steps to investigate it.
</p>
<p>As soon as Miss Harwood had gone, the inspec-
</p>
<p>tor showed the letter to his chief.
</p>
<p>" This is one of that kind of matters in which the
</p>
<p>newspapers are of the most service," said that
</p>
<p>potentate, aftera brief reflection. " We might keep
</p>
<p>this thing in our possession for a dog's age, and
</p>
<p>never know any more about it than we do now.

</p>
<p>Runyon if the clue amounts to anything at all,
</p>
<p>which is doubtful. By the way, did you ask the
</p>
<p>old lady if she had ever heard of any person of
</p>
<p>that name ?"
</p>
<p>" To be sure I did," said the inspector, " and she
</p>
<p>expresses complete ignorance. I think I'll make
</p>
<p>some inquiries of Stackhouse as to whether there
</p>
<p>was any such man to his knowledge associated with
</p>
<p>North in business, before giving the thing to the
</p>
<p>newspapers."
</p>
<p>" To be sure," said the inspector ; " but it's
</p>
<p>doubtful. Apparently North attached no import-
</p>
<p>ance to the communication, for if he had made any
</p>
<p>talk about it, we should have heard of the thing
</p>
<p>before."
</p>
<p>With the letter in his pocket, Inspector Applebee
</p>
<p>set out at once in quest of the junior partner.
</p>
<p>Inspector Applebee, however, had some diffi-
</p>
<p>culty in finding Thornton Stackhouse.
</p>
<p>The fact was that at this moment he was engaged
</p>
<p>in an earnest conference with Detective John Lamm
</p>
<p>at the latter's office.
</p>
<p>" I have come to you, Mr. Lamm," Mr. Stack-
</p>
<p>house had said, as soon as Mr. Lamm had closed
</p>
<p>the door of the inner office, " for the purpose of
</p>
<p>giving you a little information with reference to
</p>
<p>personal matters, which I ought, perhaps, to have
</p>
<p>mentioned to you before."
</p>
<p>Stackhouse looked rather perturbed, and re-
</p>
<p>frained from meeting the steady gaze of the man

</p>
<p>" I trust," said Lamm, " that it is not too late
</p>
<p>now."
</p>
<p>" No," rejoined Stackhouse nervously ; " no, it
</p>
<p>is not too late for you ; for me it may be."
</p>
<p>There was something despondently apprehensive
</p>
<p>in the tones of the man as he said these words, but
</p>
<p>overcoming with apparent effort his tendency to
</p>
<p>despair, he went on at once in a tone of forced
</p>
<p>briskness.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Lamm, I entrusted you in the first place
</p>
<p>with all that occurred to me to have any special bear-
</p>
<p>ing upon the North case, when I engaged you."
</p>
<p>The detective's raised eyebrows evidently con-
</p>
<p>veyed his surprise at this statement, for Stackhouse
</p>
<p>went on immediately : " Yes ; it is not about that,
</p>
<p>but about things immediately growing out of it that
</p>
<p>I have come to speak to you now, Mr. Lamm ; in
</p>
<p>other words of my serious domestic troubles. And,
</p>
<p>believe me, I could not say to you what I now do
</p>
<p>if I did not know that I am speaking to a trust-
</p>
<p>worthy man in absolute confidence."
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm made an appreciative gesture.
</p>
<p>"The truth is, sir, that I am utterly unable to
</p>
<p>account for the extraordinary conduct of my wife.
</p>
<p>Up to the day of this murder, sir, since the time
</p>
<p>that I married her, Mr. Lamm, we have been on
</p>
<p>the best of terms the best of terms," he repeated,
</p>
<p>reflectively, as if half losing himself in dreamy
</p>
<p>reminiscence.
</p>
<p>" And since ? " the detective insinuated.

</p>
<p>Mr. Stackhouse's reply involved a substantially
</p>
<p>252 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>accurate description of the scene which had fol-
</p>
<p>lowed his arrival at home on the afternoon of the
</p>
<p>iyth of June, a statement which it may naturally
</p>
<p>be conceived caused the detective far less aston-
</p>
<p>ishment than it might have in some circumstances.
</p>
<p>But John Lamm was delighted to have an oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity to discuss this matter with his client.
</p>
<p>" And how do you account for this ? " he queried.
</p>
<p>" I don't account for it," answered Stackhouse.
</p>
<p>" I cannot account for it. It is a great and- fright-
</p>
<p>ful nightmare ; the puzzle of my whole life. Be-
</p>
<p>lieve me, sir, you know absolutely as much about
</p>
<p>it as I do."
</p>
<p>" Still," suggested Mr. Lamm, "you might have
</p>
<p>means of surmising which I do not possess."
</p>
<p>" Ah, indeed," returned Stackhouse, " and if it
</p>
<p>were not for that fact I should not have come here.
</p>
<p>Yes, indeed, I do have means of surmising, Mr.
</p>
<p>Lamm. My wife, as an explanation of her impos-
</p>
<p>sible conduct, simply uttered a name which, I am
</p>
<p>sorry to say, I know altogether too well "
</p>
<p>" The name was ?"
</p>
<p>" Marie Moissot."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! " said the detective. " A curious name ;
</p>
<p>French ? "
</p>
<p>"No, curse her," returned Stackhouse, vindic-
</p>
<p>tively. " She was a Creole, I tell you, Lamm,
</p>
<p>and a jealous, dangerous woman. I knew her

<p>years ago, but certainly had almost forgotten her

<p>existence until this day, when I find her name upon

</p>
<p>STACKHOUSE 'S DANGEROUS ENEMY. 253
</p>
<p>" Plainly," said the detective, as Stackhouse
</p>
<p>hesitated, " what did you know of this woman ? "
</p>
<p>Stackhouse averted his eyes and drummed
</p>
<p>moodily upon the desk with his fingers for a con-
</p>
<p>siderable space without replying.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Lamm," he said at last, " the Moissot epi-
</p>
<p>sode in my experience is one I am not fond of call-
</p>
<p>ing to mind. I met the girl when she was about
</p>
<p>sixteen years old where it matters not I thought
</p>
<p>I was fond of her and was caught in the snares of
</p>
<p>her pretty face. My acquaintance with her did not
</p>
<p>last long. The vindictive temper and insane jeal-
</p>
<p>ousy of the girl, who was more of a woman than
</p>
<p>most of our Northern females of twice her age,
</p>
<p>warned me that I had made a mistake."
</p>
<p>" The parting was not voluntary on her part ? "
</p>
<p>Stackhouse ground his teeth ; his lips were dry
</p>
<p>and feverish; under the table his fists, the detective
</p>
<p>noticed, were clenched.
</p>
<p>" Certainly not," said Stackhouse. " That would
</p>
<p>have been impossible."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! " said the detective. " Unfortunate."
</p>
<p>" Unfortunate ! " echoed Stackhouse. " Good
</p>
<p>heavens, man, it was madness insanity ! "
</p>
<p>" And poor policy," added the detective sig-
</p>
<p>nificantly. " But bygones are irretrievable. And
</p>
<p>so it is this woman whom you suspect to have
</p>

<p>you and me, Mr. Lamm," said Stackhouse. ner-
</p>
<p>vously, wiping the perspiration from his brow,
</p>
<p>" Except this. Eight years ago I accidentally
</p>
<p>heard that Marie Moissot was living in New York
</p>
<p>under another name. A few years later an adven-
</p>
<p>turess blazed into notoriety in the great metropolis,
</p>
<p>under the name of Madame Perle, who tallied well
</p>
<p>with the description of this Marie. That she was
</p>
<p>the same person I am unable definitely to determine.
</p>
<p>I have only seen her photograph. I did not investi-
</p>
<p>gate nearer."
</p>
<p>Detective Lamm was becoming hugely interested.
</p>
<p>" So, so," he exclaimed. " Well, and what have
</p>
<p>you done ? "
</p>
<p>" Done ! " echoed Stackhouse, giving him a
</p>
<p>startled look.
</p>
<p>" Yes, I mean recently, since the trouble with
</p>
<p>your wife with reference to obtaining information
</p>
<p>concerning this woman."
</p>
<p>" I'll be entirely frank with you," said Stack-
</p>
<p>house. " I hesitated about making anybody a con-

<p>fidant in this purely personal matter. I therefore

<p>inserted an advertisement in Monday morning's

<p>woman. That advertisement was answered, and
</p>
<p>it brought me to a house in Shawmut Avenue, where
</p>
<p>I have excellent reasons for believing that this

<p>woman has been ; which shows conclusively that
</p>
<p>my surmises in regard to her having poisoned my

</p>
<p>deputed to meet me. I have written to her, but
</p>
<p>receiving no reply am obliged to place the matter
</p>
<p>in your hands. Mr. Lamm, do you think you can
</p>
<p>help me ?"
</p>
<p>Nothing could conceal the intense anxiety, the
</p>
<p>almost hungry look of supplication in the junior
</p>
<p>partner's face.
</p>
<p>" Ah ! " said the detective to himself, " whatever
</p>
<p>this man's past may have been, one thing of his
</p>
<p>present life is eminently plain. He loves his wife."
</p>
<p>" And you, then, don't suspect," he said aloud,
</p>
<p>" this woman of complicity in the murder of your
</p>
<p>partner ? "
</p>
<p>" I suspect her of nothing that is good and every-
</p>
<p>thing that is bad," said Stackhouse bitterly. " I
</p>
<p>know that this woman hates me with one of those
</p>
<p>hatreds that will never forget nor forgive. Wher-
</p>
<p>ever I am so long as she lives, I am in danger.
</p>
<p>She is revengeful, and, more than all, accomplished
</p>
<p>and unscrupulous."
</p>
<p>" Accomplished ? " repeated Lamm quickly.
</p>
<p>" Do you use that word intentionally, Mr. Stack-
</p>
<p>house ?"
</p>
<p>" I certainly do," replied Thornton Stackhouse.
</p>
<p>" She has all the native ability of a naturally shrewd
</p>
<p>and cunning woman, who has lost less by the
</p>
<p>neglect of her education in letters than she has
</p>
<p>gained through her direct contact with the world."
</p>
<p>"Well, then," said Lamm, drawing a full breath,

</p>
<p>fullest possible description of Marie Moissot at the
</p>
<p>very latest hour known to you."
</p>
<p>" Of course," said Stackhouse quickly, " I knew
</p>
<p>that and came prepared. I have brought you the
</p>
<p>photograph I spoke of. It was obtained for me
</p>
<p>seven years ago by a friend of mine the photo-
</p>
<p>graph of Madame Perle ! All I can say of it is
</p>
<p>that if Madame Perle be not Marie Moissot, the
</p>
<p>resemblance between the two women is strange and
</p>
<p>striking indeed."
</p>
<p>John Lamm had some difficulty to conceal his
</p>
<p>delight, as Thornton Stackhouse placed upon the
</p>
<p>table before his eyes the counterfeit presentiment
</p>
<p>of the object of Thornton Stackhouse's fears.
</p>
<p>There was no question about it. Madame Perle
</p>
<p>was Madame Raymond !
</p>
<p>When Thornton Stackhouse reissued from John
</p>
<p>Lamm's den the efficient custodians who kept him
</p>
<p>constantly under surveillance had already notified
</p>
<p>Inspector Applebee of his whereabouts. Mr. Stack-
</p>
<p>house was therefore surprised to find a hand laid
</p>
<p>lightly upon his shoulder.
</p>
<p>" One thing," said the voice of the inspector in
</p>
<p>his ear; "just one thing, Mr. Stackhouse. I wont
</p>
<p>detain you a moment. Do you know, or have you
</p>
<p>ever known, a person calling himself Albert Run-

<p>yon ? "

<p>Stackhouse staggered and steadied himself against
</p>
<p>the building for support. He fairly gasped for

<p>" What's the matter ? " said the inspector, with
</p>
<p>quick suspicion.
</p>
<p>" It is my heart," said Stackhouse hurriedly. " A
</p>
<p>sudden start you gave me. I have trouble that way.
</p>
<p>The life insurance physicians have warned me."
</p>
<p>" Excuse me," apologized the inspector. " I
</p>
<p>didn't mean to startle you. The object of my in-
</p>
<p>quiry you will find by reading this letter, which
</p>
<p>seems to have been sent anonymously to your
</p>
<p>partner about six weeks ago."
</p>
<p>Stackhouse took the letter and read it, and at the
</p>
<p>end his agitation had almost vanished. He gave it
</p>
<p>back, coolly, to the officer.

</p>
<p>ASTONISHING DISCLOSURES OF WILLARD SMITH.
</p>
<p>MEANTIME the police department had quietly
</p>
<p>made an important arrest, and had succeeded
</p>
<p>in astonishing themselves more than their prisoner.
</p>
<p>The affair had begun in the afternoon of Wednes-
</p>
<p>day at the hour when the inebriated blackmailer
</p>
<p>left the office of Richard Fetridge, and while John
</p>
<p>Lamm was demanding an explanation from the dis-
</p>
<p>comfited millionaire.
</p>
<p>" Your name is Willard Smith," said a muscular
</p>
<p>man in an uncompromising voice, suddenly step-
</p>
<p>ping in front of the man whose breath smelt of
</p>
<p>liquor as he came down the stairs from Richard
</p>
<p>Fetridge's office. There was no interrogatory in-
</p>
<p>flection in the sentence. It was stated as a quiet,
</p>
<p>matter-of-fact announcement.
</p>
<p>"That's my name," returned the unsuspecting
</p>
<p>inebriate, bristling a little with a ludicrous assump-
</p>
<p>tion of offended dignity. " And what of it ? "
</p>
<p>" This of it," said the muscular man in a tone of
</p>
<p>authority. " You're under arrest. You must come
</p>
<p>with me."
</p>
<p>The suddenness of this unexpected announcement
</p>
<p>acted like a dash of cold water in the face. The

</p>
<p>ex-clerk of North <Sc Stackhouse lost a shade of his
</p>
<p>normal color and took a staggering step backward.
</p>
<p>" Me ! Under arrest ! " he exclaimed, nearly
</p>
<p>sobered by the ominous situation. " There must
</p>
<p>be some mistake. I'm not drunk. At least not
</p>
<p>drunk enough to be arrested for it. And besides "
</p>
<p>picking up a little courage as he surveyed his
</p>
<p>unwelcome acquaintance '* you're not an officer."
</p>
<p>The muscular man turned back the lapel of his
</p>
<p>coat and exhibited his badge.
</p>
<p>" You are not arrested for being drunk, my
</p>
<p>man ; and you know that very well. Now come.
</p>
<p>Shall I put on the twisters, or will you walk
</p>
<p>quietly ? "
</p>
<p>The young man cast a hasty, frightened look
</p>
<p>about him. Two other men in citizen's clothes?
</p>
<p>who had been standing in the corridor looking
</p>
<p>quietly on, now approached.
</p>
<p>" And these these fellows are they officers,
</p>
<p>too ? "
</p>
<p>"Shouldn't wonder," returned the muscular man
</p>
<p>with a grim smile. " Now there's no need of
</p>
<p>attracting attention and making a hullabaloo about
</p>
<p>it. I'll trouble you for your arm. Glad you're
</p>
<p>sensible. Now put your best foot forward. March ! "
</p>
<p>The man seemed to obey mechanically. He was
</p>
<p>walking out of the building arm in arm with the
</p>
<p>officer. The two other men fell quietly into step
</p>
<p>behind them. The whole affair had been so brief
</p>
<p>and unobtrusive that it had not even attracted a

<p>glance of inquiry from the people who stood about
</p>
<p>260 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>But just before he came to the street the prisoner
</p>
<p>seemed to awake from his stupefaction and ex-
</p>
<p>claimed, in a voice suppliant and terrified :
</p>
<p>" For heaven's sake tell me what I am arrested
</p>
<p>for ? "
</p>
<p>" It's not my place to tell you that," replied his
</p>
<p>custodian sternly. " I am instructed to take you
</p>
<p>to headquarters. You'll be told soon enough there,
</p>
<p>I reckon."
</p>
<p>" But it's all a mistake, I tell you," whimpered
</p>
<p>the prisoner, who seemed to be woefully lacking in
</p>
<p>fortitude.
</p>
<p>" That's for you to settle with the inspectors. I
</p>
<p>haven't made any mistake," returned the custodian*
</p>
<p>And the little group passed into the street.
</p>
<p>The prisoner made no physical resistance, though
</p>
<p>he continued to remonstrate verbally till he reached
</p>
<p>the grim building in Pemberton Square, where his
</p>
<p>fate was to be settled. By this time the effects of
</p>
<p>his morning's libations seemed to have left him.
</p>
<p>He was haggard and apprehensive, and as he went
</p>
<p>up the steps into the corridor, he trembled like a
</p>
<p>conscience-stricken criminal taken in the act.
</p>
<p>He was led on through a room filled with tables
</p>
<p>and men engaged in writing, and was pushed un-
</p>
<p>ceremoniously through a doorway into a quiet inner
</p>
<p>office, where he found himself face to face with
</p>
<p>Inspector Applebee and his chief. The man who
</p>
<p>had brought him closed the door.
</p>
<p>" So this is the man ? " said Applebee, surveying

<p>him curiously.
</p>
<p>ASTONISHING DISCLOSURES. 261
</p>
<p>" This is the discharged clerk, Willard Smith,"
</p>
<p>said the officer.
</p>
<p>" So indeed it is. I should recognize him by his
</p>
<p>photograph. Sergeant, will you wait outside ?"
</p>
<p>The man who had conducted Mr. Smith thither
</p>
<p>bowed and went out. Inspector Applebee locked
</p>
<p>the door.
</p>
<p>" Sit down, my man," he said, facing the prisoner.
</p>
<p>Mr. Smith sank into a chair.
</p>
<p>" They told me" he faltered, " these fellows
</p>
<p>who brought me here that I was arrested ; but
</p>
<p>they wouldn't say what for. They said you'd tell
</p>
<p>me."
</p>
<p>He looked eagerly and apprehensively from one
</p>
<p>grave face to the other. After regarding him criti-
</p>
<p>cally, Applebee whispered a few words in the ear of
</p>
<p>his superior. The chief nodded. Both regarded
</p>
<p>the prisoner sharply.
</p>
<p>" Come," said Applebee, " make a clean breast of
</p>
<p>it, my man, if you want the law to let you off easy.
</p>
<p>Now is your time. Don't wait till it's too late.
</p>
<p>Out with it ! "
</p>
<p>" But I don't know who what you mean," stam-
</p>
<p>mered the man, turning very pale indeed. " If
</p>
<p>you'll be so kind as to say what I'm arrested for."
</p>
<p>" Oh, certainly," returned the inspector ; " we'll
</p>
<p>oblige you to that extent. You're arrested for
</p>
<p>murder."
</p>
<p>The man started out of his chair, opening his
</p>
<p>eyes very wide, repeated the ominous word, and

<p>sank back airain.
</p>
<p>262 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>" Whose ? " he gasped. " Whose murder ? "
</p>
<p>" Paul North."
</p>
<p>The wretch opened his mouth, but was unable to
</p>
<p>articulate. He sat back in his chair, staring help-
</p>
<p>lessly, and clutching at the clothing about his neck
</p>
<p>as if he found it too tight for him. The charge
</p>
<p>seemed to have produced a complete collapse.
</p>
<p>" It is now or never," whispered the chief as
</p>
<p>Applebee leaned over the desk to obtain possession
</p>
<p>of a document. " He'll confess if he's worked
</p>
<p>right."
</p>
<p>Inspector Applebee having obtained the paper
</p>
<p>he was in search of, unfolds it. It is the anony-
</p>
<p>mous letter demanding $1000 from Paul North and
</p>
<p>threatening his life in case he failed to comply with
</p>
<p>the imposed conditions. He advances toward the
</p>
<p>prisoner, holding this document behind him. See-
</p>
<p>ing him approach, Willard Smith starts into a half-
</p>
<p>erect attitude.
</p>
<p>"For Heaven's sake, explain this!" he exclaims.
</p>
<p>"It is some awful joke or other. I kill Paul
</p>
<p>North! Why, I -couldn't kill anybody. "
</p>
<p>And indeed his appearance at this moment seems
</p>
<p>to corroborate the statement.
</p>
<p>"Look at this," says Inspector Applebee, sud-
</p>
<p>denly putting the letter before his eyes. "Did you
</p>
<p>ever see that before?"
</p>
<p>The man starts, gasps, and seems to be suffering
</p>
<p>under a severe attack of fever and ague.
</p>
<p>"My letter!" he chatters in a voice barely audi-

</p>
<p>ASTONISHING DISCLOSURES. 263
</p>
<p>"Ah," said the inspector to his chief, "he recog-
</p>
<p>nizes it as his letter."
</p>
<p>"But but I don't understand where you got
</p>
<p>got it," stammered the man, with more the appear-
</p>
<p>ance of bewilderment than fear.
</p>
<p>"So?" queried the inspector. "Ah, but we
</p>
<p>have got it. And you have acknowledged the
</p>
<p>authorship of it. That's the main point."
</p>
<p>"But I never mailed that letter," exclaimed the
</p>
<p>prisoner, starting up wildly, with a gleam of hope in
</p>
<p>his eyes. "I see how it is. Somebody has been
</p>
<p>playing tricks on me."
</p>
<p>"You never mailed it!" repeated the inspector,
</p>
<p>incredulously. "Then who did?"
</p>
<p>"I wish I knew; I don't."
</p>
<p>"So? Well, then, what did you write it for?"
</p>
<p>"I wrote it when I was drunk mad crazy!"
</p>
<p>cried the prisoner excitedly. "I never could have
</p>
<p>done it if I had been in my senses. And when
</p>
<p>I came out of it I missed the letter. I looked every-
</p>
<p>where for it. I thought I must have torn it up.
</p>
<p>But as I see it is here you somebody must have
</p>
<p>picked it up and mailed it."
</p>
<p>"Oh, there's no doubt but that somebody mailed
</p>
<p>it," returned Applebee, significantly.
</p>
<p>"Yes, but I didn't. I take my solemn oath to
</p>
<p>it, sir. Unless unless I was too drunk to know it
</p>
<p>when I did it. And besides besides," he con-
</p>

<p>264 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>of Police, that the man who was with him at the
</p>
<p>time of his death "
</p>
<p>He paused abruptly and glanced in mute appeal
</p>
<p>from one face to another.
</p>
<p>"Well?" said the inspector, sharply, "go on. If
</p>
<p>you're speaking the truth you don't have to stop
</p>
<p>and think."
</p>
<p>"No," said the man, evidently nerving himself
</p>
<p>for a disagreeable duty. 'No, sir; I don't have to
</p>
<p>stop and think, but I don't like to accuse a man of
</p>
<p>a thing like this. I don't, and that's the truth."
</p>
<p>"Your only chance is in prompt and full confes-
</p>
<p>sion," said the chief inspector. "Tell us every-
</p>
<p>thing you know."
</p>
<p>"Well, then, I will," said the prisoner with the
</p>
<p>air of having made up his mind. "I'll tell you all
</p>
<p>about it, way from the beginning."
</p>
<p>It would be difficult to say which side was the
</p>
<p>more anxious at this point, the accusers or the
</p>
<p>accused. There was this marked difference the
</p>
<p>prisoner let his anxiety be seen; the trained faces
</p>
<p>of the inspectors masked their emotions completely.
</p>
<p>As the man began evidently with the intention of
</p>
<p>speaking at considerable length, the chief inspector
</p>
<p>nonchalantly drew a block of paper in front of him,
</p>
<p>dipped his pen in the ink, and prepared to take
</p>
<p>notes.

</p>
<p>tion of starting in for myself one day. I and my
</p>
<p>sister had got together some $3000." The man
</p>
<p>paused an instant and seemed to be recovering from
</p>
<p>a slight tendency to choke. Glancing around the
</p>
<p>room and then at his clothes hastily, he said, "I
</p>
<p>wasn't like this always, you know. Well, it's a
</p>
<p>short enough story and common enough. I was
</p>
<p>old enough to have known better, but I didn't.
</p>
<p>Everybody was investing, and I caught the fever,
</p>
<p>and put all my money into Nicaragua Midland
</p>
<p>stock. I had hesitated to do it till the price was
</p>
<p>up. Well, when the thing turned and began to
</p>
<p>go down I held on, hoping for another change,
</p>
<p>until well, there was nothing to hold on to.
</p>
<p>Meantime my sister, who had worked her ringers off
</p>
<p>to lay up that money, got to worrying, fell sick and
</p>
<p>died. When I paid the funeral expenses . But,
</p>
<p>pshaw! you gentlemen are not interested in that.
</p>
<p>It's quickly said. I didn't care what came, and I

<p>took to drinking heavily. One morning I woke up
</p>
<p>to find my place at North & Stackhouse's filled. I
</p>
<p>wont say anything against Mr. North. He treated

<p>me as well as he could. He advised me not to in-
</p>
<p>vest when I did, and several times when I wanted
</p>
<p>money after my discharge I went to him and he
</p>
<p>gave it to me. So that's all there was about it.
</p>
<p>But sometimes when I was drunk, I would get to
</p>
<p>feeling pretty sore against the firm, and it was at
</p>
<p>one of those times that I wrote that letter you have
</p>
<p>there.

<p>"How long ago?"

<p>266 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>"Oh, that must have been three weeks ago.
</p>
<p>And then, as I tell you, when I sobered off again I
</p>
<p>began to be frightened, and looked for the letter to
</p>
<p>destroy it, but I couldn't find it. I thought per-
</p>
<p>haps I had torn it up, though I couldn't remem-
</p>
<p>ber it. Well, then, to come down to the night Mr.
</p>
<p>North was killed. I was coming across the Public
</p>
<p>Garden with a friend of mine."
</p>
<p>"A friend?" asked the inspector, sharply.
</p>
<p>"Name and address, please."
</p>
<p>"The name," said the prisoner, a blush rising
</p>
<p>into his pale face, "is Dick Hunt; his address
</p>
<p>any place where liquor is sold and he admitted ; at
</p>
<p>other times, Deer Island. He's not an acquaint-
</p>
<p>ance to be proud of, I'll admit, but, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>I'm telling the whole truth. We were both of us
</p>
<p>with sufficient taste in our mouths to be crazy for
</p>
<p>more, but we had neither money nor credit. So
</p>
<p>when I saw Paul North and Richard Fetridge ahead
</p>
<p>of us, I dogged their steps."
</p>
<p>"What time was this?" the inspector asked
</p>
<p>quickly.
</p>
<p>"Somewhere after seven o'clock. I can't say
</p>
<p>how much after, but a little after. And I says to
</p>
<p>this fellow with me, 'Dick, you see that old duffer
</p>
<p>there? He was once the head of my place of busi-
</p>
<p>ness. If I can strike him right, I'll get a fiver out
</p>
<p>of him and we'll make a night of it.' Well, of
</p>
<p>course, that was agreeable. But I was sober enough
</p>
<p>to see that if I walked up to the old man when he

</p>
<p>mad. So I waited for him to get rid of Fetridge.
</p>
<p>We followed them then down to Marlboro Street,
</p>
<p>and saw the two men go into North's house. Not
</p>
<p>more than three minutes after this, a stylish dressed
</p>
<p>woman, who had been following down on the other
</p>
<p>sidewalk, crossed over and rang the bell. And she
</p>
<p>went in too."
</p>
<p>The chief inspector dropped his pen with a start.
</p>
<p>"Be careful what you say," said the inspector in
</p>
<p>a warning tone; "if you are lying it will be used
</p>
<p>against you."
</p>
<p>"Good Heavens! I feel as if I was on trial for
</p>
<p>my life now!" exclaimed the prisoner. "It's gos-
</p>
<p>pel truth, gentlemen, every word of it, as I hope for
</p>
<p>mercy hereafter."
</p>
<p>"These three people went into the house, and
</p>
<p>you stood watching in front of it?"
</p>
<p>"Just the truth, sir. And we waited and waited,
</p>
<p>walking up and down, for we wanted the money
</p>
<p>bad, and I was pretty sure I could get it from Mr.
</p>
<p>North. I had tried it before, you see. But I knew
</p>
<p>him too well to disturb him when he was busy; and
</p>
<p>I thought he was busy perhaps selling the house
</p>
<p>to Fetridge. We came pretty near giving it up,
</p>
<p>but at last we saw the woman come out and start
</p>
<p>up street."
</p>
<p>"So indeed!" exclaimed Applebee, greatly per-
</p>
<p>turbed. "What time was that?"
</p>
<p>"It was not quite nine, b:it must have been very
</p>
<p>near it. I remember hearing the bell strike after-
</p>
<p>wards, and not a great many minutes afterwards,

<p>either."
</p>
<p>268 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>"How near did she pass you?"
</p>
<p>"Near enough for me to see her; for at that min-
</p>
<p>ute I stood directly at the foot of the steps."
</p>
<p>"Did you recognize her?"
</p>
<p>"No; for she was a stranger to me."
</p>
<p>"Be particular now. Are you acquainted with
</p>
<p>North's two daughters"
</p>
<p>"I know them by sight, sir."
</p>
<p>"And this woman was not the younger one?"
</p>
<p>"She was not either of them. Nothing like them,
</p>
<p>sir. Not in the least anything about her."
</p>
<p>"Can't you describe her?"
</p>
<p>But Willard Smith's impressions were not suffi-
</p>
<p>ciently vivid to enable him to present a photo-
</p>
<p>graphic likeness.
</p>
<p>"Go on, then," said the inspector. "What hap*
</p>
<p>pened next?"
</p>
<p>"Why, you see, sir, this Mr. Fetridge was directly
</p>
<p>behind her, and when he came down the steps I
</p>
<p>was tired of waiting. So I put a bold face on it
</p>
<p>and touched him on the shoulder."
</p>
<p>"You spoke to him then?"
</p>
<p>"To be sure I did. I pretended to call him
</p>
<p>North by mistake, and then affecting to discover
</p>
<p>my error I told Mr. Fetridge what I was going to
</p>
<p>ask Mr. North. If he couldn't help a poor fellow
</p>
<p>out by lending him five dollars. He stopped short,
</p>
<p>gave me one look that took me all in, and, says he,
</p>
<p>'Good heavens, Smith! Are you reduced to this?
</p>
<p>I I'm sorry for you' just like that, and put the
</p>
<p>money in my hand."

</p>
<p>tioned the chief. "Was it unusual? Did he show
</p>
<p>any sign of excitement?"
</p>
<p>"I thought he was a little excited, sir, when I
</p>
<p>first touched him he jumped so ; but I was in too
</p>
<p>much of a hurry to be off with my money to stop
</p>
<p>long after he gave it to me."
</p>
<p>"Then you didn't stay long enough to see any-
</p>
<p>thing more?"
</p>
<p>"I stayed long enough to see him go up street
</p>
<p>with the woman. Nothing else."
</p>
<p>"And you saw nobody else go out or come in
</p>
<p>while you were there?"
</p>
<p>"I did not."
</p>
<p>"Think now. Wasn't there another woman?"
</p>
<p>"There was not," answered the prisoner, posi-
</p>
<p>tively. "Both of us were watching all the time.
</p>
<p>Nobody else went out or came in during the whole
</p>
<p>time. I can swear to it."
</p>
<p>"Well, then," said the chief sternly, "why didn't
</p>
<p>you come to the police with the story when you first
</p>
<p>heard of the murder?"
</p>
<p>"Because I went to see Mr. Fetridge about it,
</p>
<p>and he told me not to he he gave me money not
</p>
<p>to. At least well, the first time he said 'Don't do
</p>
<p>it,' and then asked, kind of insinuating: 'Aren't
</p>
<p>you in need of money?' Of course I said yes, and
</p>
<p>then he gave me ten dollars."
</p>
<p>The inspectors exchanged glances of astonish-
</p>
<p>ment.

<p>"And and afterwards." resumed the man after
</p>
<p>a brief hesitation, "when I had drunk up this

<p>27 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>"Demanded!" echoed Applebee. "And he "
</p>
<p>"Gave it to me."
</p>
<p>The inspector looked incredulous. The pris-
</p>
<p>oner's trembling fingers wandered to a pocket of his
</p>
<p>vest. He produced a crisp new ten-dollar bill.
</p>
<p>"Here it is," he affirmed. "They arrested me
</p>
<p>just as I was coming away."
</p>
<p>Applebee turned to the chief and began a hurried
</p>
<p>conversation in whispers. The miserable fellow in
</p>
<p>the chair opposite them watched them with eyes of
</p>
<p>awful apprehension.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Applebee turned to him again.
</p>
<p>"One question, my man. Where did you pass
</p>
<p>the remainder of the night?"
</p>
<p>The man mentioned several places and the names
</p>
<p>of several individuals.
</p>
<p>"Well, my man," said the inspector, "you'll have
</p>
<p>to go to jail for a time ; but I hope it may be short.
</p>
<p>We'll do what we can for you if we find you've told
</p>
<p>us the truth. You understand. We meant what
</p>
<p>we said when we advised you to confess."
</p>
<p>For circumstances had suddenly changed this man
</p>
<p>from a prospective defendant in a murder trial to a
</p>
<p>possible government witness of prime importance.
</p>
<p>As Willard Smith, dejected and ashamed, was led
</p>
<p>away between the officers who came to conduct him
</p>
<p>to jail the chief inspector was saying, in an excited
</p>
<p>undertone, to Inspector Applebee
</p>
<p>"Money or no money, it will make no difference.

<p>CHAPTER XXT.
</p>
<p>THE HEAD OF THE SERPENT.
</p>
<p>TT7ITHOUT denying that the press, in these
</p>
<p>VV days of sharp news competition, occasionally
</p>
<p>clogs the wheels of justice in the effort to supply
</p>
<p>the public with the latest news in great criminal
</p>
<p>affairs (in little ones, where the interest is not great,
</p>
<p>there is little fault to be found), it must none the
</p>
<p>less be said that in most cases the extreme publicity
</p>
<p>given to the details becomes in itself a mighty en-
</p>
<p>gine of detection. Possessed of all the facts, the
</p>
<p>entire public is resolved into a detective force. The
</p>
<p>salient points of the case, which in other countries
</p>
<p>are kept profoundly secret among a few men, are
</p>
<p>in everybody's mouth. The people are made famil-
</p>
<p>iar with the appearance, the histories, the peculiar
</p>
<p>facts in the lives of the victim, and of those sus-
</p>
<p>pected of complicity in the crime. The result is
</p>
<p>that a few hours after the publication of the impor-
</p>
<p>tant details of a mysterious crime people begin to
</p>
<p>flock to the offices of the great newspapers, eager to
</p>
<p>contribute the mite of information which they pos-
</p>
<p>sess. As time goes on, and the facts gain a wider
</p>
<p>and wider circulation, even that ever-lessening circle

</p>
<p>the fountain-head of general information, the news-
</p>
<p>paper, is reached, and if there is any suspicious fact
</p>
<p>known to any disinterested person in the community
</p>
<p>it is more than likely to be brought to light through
</p>
<p>the same peculiar channel.
</p>
<p>The North case was certainly not an anomaly in
</p>
<p>this respect. North & Stackhouse were too well
</p>
<p>known through their dealings with the public not to
</p>
<p>have left all sorts of " clues " and suspicious circum-
</p>
<p>stances in the past, which were sure to come out as
</p>
<p>soon as the dreadful crime set everybody talking
</p>
<p>about them. To Thomas were referred daily
</p>
<p>several people who came to the Globe office for the
</p>
<p>purpose of affording, through that journal, some
</p>
<p>assistance in carrying on the important investiga-
</p>
<p>tion, which, though as yet so little successful, had
</p>
<p>set everybody agog with wonder. From these peo-
</p>
<p>ple the reporter learned that North and Stackhouse
</p>
<p>had many enemies, more or less bitter and personal,
</p>
<p>rising from their questionable business transactions:
</p>
<p>but there was nothing which impressed him as suf-
</p>
<p>ficiently promising to be important until the morn-
</p>
<p>ing of Saturday, June 25, a gentleman called who
</p>
<p>related a little circumstance which seemed to him
</p>
<p>pregnant with possible significance. It certainly
</p>
<p>lacked no element of romantic and mysterious
</p>
<p>interest.
</p>
<p>It was an episode in a Boston broker's office in
</p>
<p>which a very pretty woman figured. The man
</p>
<p>could not recall all the details, but he recollected
</p>

</p>
<p>that this woman had preceded him in the occupancy
</p>
<p>THE HEAD OF THE SERPENT. 2 73
</p>
<p>of an inner office, and that while he was waiting for
</p>
<p>her to come out he heard scraps of a very animated
</p>
<p>conversation of which North & Stackhouse were
</p>
<p>the subject. In the partition between the outer and
</p>
<p>inner office were a series of large windows, which
</p>
<p>were generally in various degrees of openness.
</p>
<p>As he stood with his back against the partition, the
</p>
<p>narrator could not well avoid hearing the conversa-
</p>
<p>tion between the broker and his fair client, and
</p>
<p>after the glimpse he had caught of the latter his
</p>
<p>curiosity was considerably aroused. The broker
</p>
<p>seemed to have been defending the reputation of
</p>
<p>North & Stackhouse, on the ground that it was
</p>
<p>necessary to expect just such phenomena in the
</p>
<p>stock market, but the woman, who seemed to have
</p>
<p>been a heavy loser in the Nicaragua Midland, was
</p>
<p>unsparing in her denunciations of the firm, which
</p>
<p>she delivered in not especially choice English with
</p>
<p>a slight foreign accent, but in the bitterest and
</p>
<p>most vindictive tone imaginable.
</p>
<p>" Hush ! " said the broker suddenly ; " there is
</p>
<p>Mr. Stackhouse now." And sure enough the junior
</p>
<p>partner of the aforesaid firm was crossing the office
</p>
<p>at that minute. Immediately there was a suppresed
</p>
<p>scream, followed by a rustle of silk, and the door
</p>
<p>between the inner and outer offices closed with a
</p>
<p>violence that caused the listener to rebound from
</p>
<p>the partition. The clerks looked up from their
</p>
<p>writing. Stackhouse himself appeared slightly
</p>
<p>startled, but he seemed to be in a hurry and trans-

</p>
<p>of time. Meanwhile in the inner office the broker
</p>
<p>was addressing his client in tones of solicitous
</p>
<p>alarm. What was the matter ?
</p>
<p>" And do you mean to tell me that that man was
</p>
<p>this Mr. Stackhouse of North & Stackhouse ? "
</p>
<p>the woman said hurriedly.
</p>
<p>" To be sure he is," answered the broker.
</p>
<p>" And it is to that man that I was entrusting my
</p>
<p>money ?"
</p>
<p>There was such a dangerous inflection in the
</p>
<p>woman's voice that the broker was apparently sur-
</p>
<p>prised into silence, and immediately she broke out
</p>
<p>in the most violent imprecations and epithets which
</p>
<p>the listener had ever heard pass a woman's lips.
</p>
<p>" Why," said the narrator to the reporter, " I
</p>
<p>felt as if I were standing outside a cage watching a
</p>
<p>mad tigress expending her strength on the iron
</p>
<p>bars. I didn't know what she could have against
</p>
<p>Thornton Stackhouse, but I thought I would rather
</p>
<p>be in any position than in that man's shoes with
</p>
<p>such a woman in his wake. But as it was none of
</p>
<p>my business, I ceased to trouble myself about it."
</p>
<p>This was the extent of the informant's observa-
</p>
<p>tion. He was buttonholed by a business acquain-
</p>
<p>tance at that minute, and heard and saw no more
</p>
<p>except that the woman shortly afterward went
</p>
<p>out, and that her passion had left her very pale for
</p>
<p>one of her complexion. That this episode might
</p>
<p>be of value had not occurred to him till he had
</p>
<p>read an article in that morning's Globe suggesting

</p>
<p>a conspiracy against Stackhouse ; but he desired to
</p>
<p>THE HEAD OF THE SERPENT. 275
</p>
<p>give the information in strict confidence, as he did
</p>
<p>not care to be placed in the light of an eavesdrop-
</p>
<p>per before his business associates. Mr. Thomas
</p>
<p>assured him that he might rest easy on that score,
</p>
<p>and hastened to follow up the new clue.
</p>
<p>It was with a glow of genuine excitement that
</p>
<p>after an hour's interview with the broker, in whose
</p>
<p>office this episode had occurred, Mr. Thomas has-
</p>
<p>tened to the office of John Lamm.
</p>
<p>He met the detective at the foot of the stairs,
</p>
<p>and they went up together. The outer office was
</p>
<p>occupied, and Lamm led the way to his den.
</p>
<p>Scarcely a word had been interchanged. Both
</p>
<p>men were eager to speak.
</p>
<p>"I've got something that will surprise you," said
</p>
<p>Thomas, " so prepare to sponge out a few of the
</p>
<p>figures on your slate and begin on a new scent."
</p>
<p>" Yes ? "
</p>
<p>"You have had your say about Marion Stack-
</p>
<p>house. Now, I simply want to show you that there
</p>
<p>are others who have shown themselves to be more
</p>
<p>vindictive enemies of her husband than she has. I
</p>
<p>bring you a new name."
</p>
<p>" Not the Albert Runyon which appears in the
</p>
<p>anonymous letter to North which you published
</p>
<p>yesterday ? "
</p>
<p>" No, sir ; something more tangible than that.
</p>
<p>Madame Raymond."
</p>
<p>Thomas had expected Lamm to present a face
</p>
<p>of deep professional interest, but to his chagrin the

<p>detective actually laughed.

<p>276 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>"You don't mean to say, my friend, that you
</p>
<p>have just heard of her ? Why, I've been working
</p>
<p>on her for days ! "
</p>
<p>Thomas stared.
</p>
<p>" Then you don't care to hear what I have dis-
</p>
<p>covered ? "
</p>
<p>" By all means," said Lamm, regaining his
</p>
<p>seriousness. " It may be just what I need to round
</p>
<p>out the facts already in my possession."
</p>
<p>The reporter began his story. He first told
</p>
<p>what his voluntary informant had told him, and
</p>
<p>then of his visit to the broker. It appeared that
</p>
<p>the latter had a distinct recollection of the episode
</p>
<p>in his office, though he professed to attach no
</p>
<p>importance to it, to see no connection between it
</p>
<p>and subsequent events. To be sure the woman
</p>
<p>had acted unaccountably strange ; but weren't
</p>
<p>women always doing something that no man would
</p>
<p>ever think of ? However, the broker was willing
</p>
<p>to give the reporter every possible aid. The
</p>
<p>woman's name was Mme. Marie Raymond, and she
</p>
<p>had been a customer in stocks for some two years.
</p>
<p>She was a New York woman, and had been re-
</p>
<p>markably lucky in all her experiments except the
</p>
<p>bubble Nicaragua Midland. To the fact of her
</p>
<p>losses the broker wholly atrributed her conduct on
</p>
<p>the occasion in question, which had been about six
</p>
<p>weeks previous. She was not the person to bear
</p>
<p>any defeat with equanimity.
</p>
<p>" And now," said John Lamm, " when does he

<p>say he was last visited by this woman ? "
</p>
<p>THE HEAD OF THE SERPENT. 277
</p>
<p>" Not since that occasion. All her business had
</p>
<p>been done by mail, postmarked New York."
</p>
<p>"Umha! And did he mention that he sent her
</p>
<p>to Richard Fetridge ? "
</p>
<p>" No."
</p>
<p>" Well, he did, Thomas, unwittingly ; and as
</p>
<p>sure as you are sitting in that chair you have just
</p>
<p>related to me the initial scene of the tragedy in
</p>
<p>Paul North's house."
</p>
<p>Thomas stared at his friend, the detective, to
</p>
<p>assure himself that he was in earnest and in his
</p>
<p>right mind. But there could be no doubt on either
</p>
<p>point.
</p>
<p>" And then," said the reporter eagerly, " you
</p>
<p>give up the idea that Marion Stackhouse originated
</p>
<p>the conspiracy ? "
</p>
<p>" Well," returned Lamm, " I give up very little.
</p>
<p>My opinions have been enlarged and modified to
</p>
<p>suit the new facts not changed. However, it's
</p>
<p>not theories you want now, but facts. Let me give
</p>
<p>you an idea of what work I have been doing since
</p>
<p>our last conference."
</p>
<p>The detective took out his notebook, opened it
</p>
<p>upon his knee, and referred to his hieroglyphics.
</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Thomas, your broker quite unwit-
</p>
<p>tingly sent Madame Raymond, alias Madame Perle,
</p>
<p>and as a matter of fact, Marie Moissot, Creole, born
</p>
<p>in New Orleans, twenty-seven years ago, to Rich-
</p>
<p>ard Fetridge. Her conference with the broker was

<p>May 10. Her appearance in Richard Fetridge's

</p>
<p>278 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>have casually mentioned it as reported in the street
</p>
<p>that North & Stackhouse are all right because
</p>
<p>backed by Richard Fetridge."
</p>
<p>Thomas marveled at the apparent accuracy of
</p>
<p>his friend's statements.
</p>
<p>" In the name of wonder, where have you been
</p>
<p>the past forty-eight hours ? " he asked.
</p>
<p>" My sources of information are confidential but
</p>
<p>reliable," said the detective. " The almighty dollar
</p>
<p>will sometimes open the mouth of the confidential
</p>
<p>servant that is, while the confidential servant that
</p>
<p>was, if he is approached properly, is ever ready to
</p>
<p>get his old master into a scrape. And, besides that,
</p>
<p>I have received the confessions of a gentleman who
</p>
<p>shall be nameless, whose means of judgment are
</p>
<p>unexceptional."
</p>
<p>" I understand dimly, but enough. Never mind
</p>
<p>the how ; let's have the what."
</p>
<p>"At once, my boy. The nth of last May,
</p>
<p>Madame Raymond visited Richard Fetridge for
</p>
<p>the first time. When she came in at the door he
</p>
<p>looked upon an entire stranger. She came openly
</p>
<p>to discover the exact standing of North & Stack-
</p>
<p>house as a firm, and of North and Stackhouse as
</p>
<p>individuals. In the midst of their conference about
</p>
<p>Stackhouse, the woman began to talk in a loud
</p>
<p>voice, uttering such sentences as these : 'Thornton
</p>
<p>Stackhouse must go to the wall, my friend, wife or
</p>
<p>no wife ! He shant escape me, now that I know
</p>
<p>him ! The man I have been turning heaven and

</p>
<p>, THE HEAD OF THE SERPENT. 279
</p>
<p>make him feel the same degradation of social scorn
</p>
<p>that he has made others feel.' Thereupon Mr.
</p>
<p>Fetridge, observing that this extraordinary speech
</p>
<p>had attracted the attention of his clerk, who has for-
</p>
<p>gotten himself so far as to stare at the woman with
</p>
<p>his mouth open, hustles his mysterious visitor with
</p>
<p>mysterious haste into his inner office, and not only
</p>
<p>closes the door, but locks it. The conference lasted
</p>
<p>fully two hours. Fetridge came out once or twice
</p>
<p>to dismiss some visitor or other, and the change in
</p>
<p>his color and manner was so marked that the clerk
</p>
<p>was greatly impressed. So much so, in fact, that
</p>
<p>he began to wonder and to watch for madame's
</p>
<p>return."
</p>
<p>" It is plain where you got your information,
</p>
<p>Lamm. But go on. His secret is as safe with
</p>
<p>both of us as with one."
</p>
<p>" Did I not know that, Mr. Kingman F. Thomas,
</p>
<p>this offensive and defensive alliance of ours would
</p>
<p>never have been formed. Well, the clerk waited
</p>
<p>some days in vain for the return of the madame.
</p>
<p>But he avows on his honor that he never met a man
</p>
<p>so systematically irritable, abstracted, and nervous
</p>
<p>as was Richard Fetridge during the interim. Fi-
</p>
<p>nally, on the i4th of last month, Madame Raymond
</p>
<p>visited the office a second time. On this occasion
</p>
<p>our friend Fetridge received her eagerly, and bade
</p>
<p>his clerk inform all callers that he was out. They
</p>
<p>retired to the inner office. The clerk could not
</p>
<p>restrain his curiosity, and he attempted to satisfy it

<p>by applying both eye and ear to the keyhole. The
</p>
<p>28o WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>door was opened upon him suddenly, and his atti-
</p>
<p>tude and confusion were considered by Richard
</p>
<p>Fetridge good grounds for his peremptory dis-
</p>
<p>charge.
</p>
<p>" His unfortunate effort had only put him into
</p>
<p>possession of the following statement from the lips
</p>
<p>of the woman ; and you can easily imagine that it
</p>
<p>meant worse than nothing to him :
</p>
<p>" ' Mr. Fetridge, you and I understand each
</p>
<p>other, then. You will go to New Orleans : thence
</p>
<p>to Montreal. You will then find out that every
</p>
<p>word I have told you is the truth. When you
</p>
<p>return, you will meet me in New York. I will
</p>
<p>come to Boston with you, and we will act together.' "
</p>
<p>" Whew ! " ejaculated Thomas, whose eyes
</p>
<p>gleamed with excitement. "This is most extra-
</p>
<p>ordinary."
</p>
<p>" Then what will you say to the sequel, my boy ?
</p>
<p>Within two days Richard Fetridge had started upon
</p>
<p>that mysterious month's absence about which we
</p>
<p>were curious a while ago. You can easily under-
</p>
<p>stand now why he was so long gone. New Orleans
</p>
<p>and Montreal are a long distance apart, and the
</p>
<p>events which he wished to verify happened more
</p>
<p>than ten years ago."
</p>
<p>" And what events do you suppose them to be ? "
</p>
<p>" There is no moral doubt about the matter. He
</p>
<p>was investigating the history of the junior partner
</p>
<p>of North & Stackhouse, the man whom you your-
</p>
<p>self once said to me had no past."

<p>"The affair grows complicated," said Thomas.

<p>THE HEAD OF THE SERPENT. 281
</p>
<p>" But I can dimly see a light ahead, I fancy. Go
</p>
<p>on."
</p>
<p>"There is little more to be said. But that little
</p>
<p>is much. Richard Fetridge and Mme. Raymond
</p>
<p>reached Boston on the same day, June 14, Tues-
</p>

</p>
<p>The detective hesitated.
</p>
<p>" At what time ? " demanded the reporter,
</p>
<p>eagerly.
</p>
<p>" Well, sir," answered John Lamm impressively,

</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXII.
</p>
<p>THE MEDEA WEEPS!
</p>
<p>A DOUBLE knock at the door interrupted the
</p>
<p>1\ conference at this moment. John Lamm's
</p>
<p>assistant, admitted, whispered a few words in the
</p>
<p>detective's ear.
</p>
<p>" Bring her in," said Lamm aloud. As the man
</p>
<p>passed out, the detective tipped Thomas a wink.
</p>
<p>" It's my little amateur detective at North's," he
</p>
<p>murmured.
</p>
<p>Immediately a spruce and bright-eyed brunette,
</p>
<p>very tastily dressed, crossed the threshold, with a
</p>
<p>bright smile for her employer ; but when she saw
</p>
<p>Thomas she hesitated and drew back.
</p>
<p>" Oh, it's all right. Don't be afraid. It's only
</p>
<p>my partner," said Lamm reassuringly. He intro-
</p>
<p>duced her to Mr. Thomas, closed the door, and
</p>
<p>gave her a chair.
</p>
<p>" Don't be afraid to speak out," he said kindly.
</p>
<p>" You're among friends."
</p>
<p>" I'm afraid all but to death," said the girl, who
</p>
<p>was evidently excited. " If this thing should ever
</p>
<p>come out about me ! Not that I care for my pre-
</p>
<p>sent place. I'd have given notice last week if it
</p>
<p>hadn't been for you, Mr. Lamm."

</p>
<p>" Now, don't go to worrying, my girl. Your ser-
</p>
<p>vices to the cause of justice will not only be re-
</p>
<p>warded here, but hereafter, as I have always told
</p>
<p>you. Now I see you have something to tell me.
</p>
<p>What is it ? "
</p>
<p>" Gracious ! " exclaimed the girl, " I'm all in a
</p>
<p>fluster. Better ask me what it isn't. There's so
</p>
<p>much, I couldn't write it. I didn't dare to. I I'm
</p>
<p>a thief. What do you think I've done ? Stolen a
</p>
<p>letter."
</p>
<p>The girl announced this with a half-triumphant,
</p>
<p>half-frightened air, and looked quickly from face to
</p>
<p>face, to see whether her conduct was considered
</p>
<p>exemplary.
</p>
<p>" Oh, you're getting on," said Lamm, repressing
</p>
<p>a tendency to smile. " You'll be way up in the pro-
</p>
<p>fession in a short time."
</p>
<p>" I wouldn't have done it," said the girl, flashing
</p>
<p>a gratefulglance toward her employer, " if it hadn't
</p>
<p>been for one thing. My brother John wrote me
</p>
<p>yesterday that he had got that nice place you pro-
</p>
<p>mised me to get him. And them as remembers me,
</p>
<p>why, I remembers them."
</p>
<p>And without further ado, the maid searched in
</p>
<p>the bosom of her dress, and produced an envelope.
</p>
<p>" The lady went out last night, and while she was
</p>
<p>gone I went through her writing desk. I didn't
</p>
<p>have time to do all I'd liked to. I was too scared.
</p>
<p>But this was put all by itself in a little drawer, and
</p>
<p>I thought by the way it read it might be useful."

<p>The detective took the letter with an indifferent
</p>
<p>284 WRITTEN IN RED,
</p>
<p>air ; but the moment he began to read it his face
</p>
<p>changed color. Actually, Thomas did not believe
</p>
<p>that John Lamm would betray so much agitation.
</p>
<p>But his own turn was coming. Without a word of
</p>
<p>comment, Mr. Lamm thrust the open letter into his
</p>
<p>friend's hand.
</p>
<p>And this was what Thomas saw :
</p>
<p>" BOSTON, June 16, 1887.
</p>
<p>" MY DEAR MADAM. Mr. Richard Fetridge and Mr. North,
</p>
<p>your father, are to have secretly a conference at the Boston
</p>
<p>House. Marlboro Street, after dinner to-night. The subject
</p>
<p>to be discussed is your husband. They will try to keep from
</p>
<p>you the object. If, now, you are a wise woman, and value
</p>
<p>your reputation and your happiness in the future, you will not
</p>
<p>hesitate to secrete yourself in that house to them unknown,
</p>
<p>before seven o'clock. You may then hear all, and govern your-
</p>
<p>self therewith. Breathe a word of this confidential communi-
</p>
<p>cation to anybody, and all your chances you will destroy of
</p>
<p>knowing that you are deceived, outraged, shamefully victimized,
</p>
<p>by those who should protect you best.
</p>
<p>Believe me a woman, dear madam, who sympathizes with
</p>
<p>you, and your
</p>
<p>" FRIEND AND WELL WISHER."
</p>
<p>Without a word Thomas hastened to open his
</p>
<p>pocket-book, and to produce a second letter, which
</p>
<p>had been loaned him by Inspector Applebee for
</p>
<p>publication in the Globe. It was the anonymous
</p>
<p>missive denouncing Albert Runyon to Paul North.
</p>
<p>Thomas laid the two epistles side by side and
</p>
<p>triumphantly thrust them under Mr. Lamm's eyes
</p>
<p>with a single comment :

</p>
<p>Indisputable fact. The same person had written
</p>
<p>both letters.
</p>
<p>" Well ! well ! well ! " murmured John Lamm
</p>
<p>helplessly.
</p>
<p>" Who's at the bottom of your conspiracy now?"
</p>
<p>Thomas whispered triumphantly. " Ah, my boy,
</p>
<p>you'll have to revise your facts to fit these circum-
</p>
<p>stances."
</p>
<p>The detective checked him with a warning look,
</p>
<p>and immediately addressed the maid :
</p>
<p>" You say Mrs. Stackhouse went out last evening.
</p>
<p>Do you know why ? "
</p>
<p>" Well, you may be sure I do. If not, I can
</p>
<p>guess," returned the maid. " She spent all the
</p>
<p>afternoon trying to write a letter. She must have
</p>
<p>torn up a dozen, for the waste basket was half full
</p>
<p>of scraps. And she went to the post office and put
</p>
<p>it in with her own hand, for Moffett saw her."
</p>
<p>" Indeed ! " said Lamm ; " and we, I suppose,
</p>
<p>have no means of knowing for whom that letter
</p>
<p>was meant ? "
</p>
<p>" Yes, indeed, we have," returned the maid, with
</p>
<p>an air of self-conscious shrewdness. " I happened
</p>
<p>to be in at the time she was going out. It was a
</p>
<p>big, square, cream-white envelope, such as she
</p>
<p>always writes on, and was written to Thornton
</p>
<p>Stackhouse, Adams House, Boston."
</p>
<p>" Umph ! And so she has at last answered him,
</p>
<p>Thomas," he whispered in his friend's ear; "we
</p>
<p>must have that letter or the ones that she didn't

</p>

</p>
<p>Thomas nodded.
</p>
<p>" And this, I suppose, is all ? " asked the detec-
</p>
<p>tive, turning again to the young woman.
</p>
<p>Mollie White shrugged her shoulders and actually
</p>
<p>tittered in her delight.
</p>
<p>"Well, I guess not. Well, I guess not," she
</p>
<p>exclaimed, and enjoyed the huge anticipation and
</p>
<p>wonder to be read in the faces of the two men.
</p>
<p>" Mollie, you're a jewel," said John Lamm, with
</p>
<p>genuine admiration. " If you keep on this way
</p>
<p>I'll get brother John's salary raised. Now, what
</p>
<p>is it ? "
</p>
<p>" Well, you see, sir, to begin with, Miss Har-
</p>
<p>wood went out last evening to visit a friend of
</p>
<p>hers, and while she was gone Mrs. Marion had a
</p>
<p>visitor."
</p>
<p>"Was this before or after the letter was writ-
</p>
<p>ten?"
</p>
<p>" This was after it was written, but before it was
</p>
<p>posted, sir. He only stayed half an hour, and
</p>
<p>afterward she went right and carried the letter."
</p>
<p>" By he, of course you mean ' the friend of the
</p>
<p>family,' Mr. Fetridge ? "
</p>
<p>The girl tossed her head with a contemptuous
</p>
<p>sniff.
</p>
<p>" Friend of the family, indeed ! Well, the family
</p>
<p>with him consists of one person, I can tell you ;
</p>
<p>and that person don't scarcely be in a position to
</p>
<p>return his affections."
</p>
<p>" Eh ? Eh ? What's this ?" said Lamm. " Love-

</p>
<p>" No wonder you're surprised, Mr. Lamm, and
</p>
<p>she a married woman ! Well, you may be sure I
</p>
<p>was ; and if it wasn't for you I'd give my notice at
</p>
<p>once. Never till last night did I really suspect the
</p>
<p>baseness of such a monster ; but then I saw with
</p>
<p>my own eyes and heard with my own ears."
</p>
<p>" So you listened to their conversation, did
</p>
<p>you ?"
</p>
<p>"And what harm? If it was me they suspected
</p>
<p>of thieving they'd have no hesitancy, ladies and
</p>
<p>gentlemen though they consider themselves to be.
</p>
<p>Before this, you see, I haven't a-dared to risk it on
</p>
<p>account of Miss Harwood, but last night, the old
</p>
<p>lady being out and nobody on the floor but myself,
</p>
<p>I just quietly sidled up to the portiere and peeked
</p>
<p>in. You see, it was warm and the light in the hall
</p>
<p>hadn't been turned on, and it was so dark you
</p>
<p>could scarcely see your hand, but the glass doors
</p>
<p>leading from the parlor to the veranda were
</p>
<p>opened, and the missis and her fine gentleman were
</p>
<p>sitting full in the stream of moonlight."
</p>
<p>" Umha ! How interesting you are, Miss White !
</p>
<p>Describe their attitudes as near as you can re-
</p>
<p>member."
</p>
<p>" Well, sir, she was fidgety and drawn away; but
</p>
<p>he was tender and kept coming nearer on the sofa.
</p>
<p>' You know what the obstacles are,' says she. 'And
</p>
<p>if there were no obstacles ? ' says he. ' Oh, Rich-
</p>
<p>ard, I am a very wretched woman ! ' says she, which
</p>
<p>was true enough in all conscience. She kept tap-

</p>
<p>away from him, and he getting nearer and bolder
</p>
<p>all the time, and finally he caught her hand. ' You
</p>
<p>are making yourself miserable, Marion,' says he.
</p>
<p>But she pulled herself away and got up and nearly
</p>
<p>froze him with her look. ' You forget, sir ! ' says
</p>
<p>she. ' Everything but my mad love for you, yes,'
</p>
<p>says he. And as he was getting on his knees she
</p>
<p>put out her hands in front of her as if to ward him
</p>
<p>off, and says, ' Oh, Richard ! Richard ! Am I not
</p>
<p>wretched enough already without your making me
</p>
<p>worse ? ' But I guess he thought not, for he kept
</p>
<p>on making her a great deal worse."
</p>
<p>" And as I understand it," said the detective,
</p>
<p>" she was not so tremendously angry, after all ? "
</p>
<p>" Well, not what I call angry," returned the par-
</p>
<p>lor maid promptly. " If it had been me, and me a
</p>
<p>married woman, I'd have knocked him down ; but
</p>
<p>she only seemed to get on her guard to keep him
</p>

<p>she says she aint married, and I suppose if she's
</p>
<p>got that notion it makes a difference. ' And ah,

<p>" Cry ! " echoed the parlor maid. " And why
</p>
<p>THE MEDEA WEEPS. 289
</p>
<p>not ? I've seen the tears come into her eyes for
</p>
<p>very spite. Oh, I guess you don't know that
</p>
<p>woman. She can cuddle up and be as cunning as
</p>
<p>a kitten if she wants to. Well, she was very melan-
</p>
<p>choly then, and sat down and cried for a long time,
</p>
<p>and he tried to console her, and she kept saying it
</p>
<p>was ' useless,' to ' leave her alone,' to have ' pity on
</p>
<p>her ' and that sort. And says he, ' But what's the
</p>
<p>harm, Marion, after all, since you know the truth
</p>
<p>and I know it, why can't we go a long way from
</p>
<p>here and be happy yet ? ' But she wouldn't hear
</p>
<p>of it. ' No,' she says, ' there's no happiness for me
</p>
<p>anywhere,' and I guess that's true enough too, for
</p>
<p>she's not the kind that would ever be happy if she
</p>
<p>had the run of everything. ' Oh,' she says, 'you
</p>
<p>don't know me, Richard Fetridge, or you'd repulse
</p>
<p>me, instead of sitting beside me.' "
</p>
<p>" Did she say that ? Are you sure ? " broke in
</p>
<p>Thomas.
</p>
<p>" That, or something awfully near it, sir. I'm
</p>
<p>not taking my oath to every word ; but I'll take
</p>
<p>my chances on getting the sense out of a thing
</p>
<p>once I hear it good. ' I know you, Marion,' says
</p>
<p>he, 'very well. You're reckless, and impulsive, and
</p>
<p>proud, but you mean to do right. You have carried
</p>
<p>your pride before this to the brink of ruining your
</p>
<p>own happiness and making a wreck of my life, but
</p>

<p>290 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>stopped and said, ' At times I feel as if I was pos-
</p>
<p>sessed of the devil.' And I thought to myself,
</p>
<p>others in your service have thought so besides you,
</p>
<p>young lady. But the way she said it, I can tell
</p>
<p>you, gentlemen, half beneath her breath, was
</p>
<p>enough to give one the creeps. It even seemed to
</p>
<p>scare him for the minute. And then he tried to
</p>
<p>cheer her up, and she began to go on about her
</p>
<p>sister Stella, and to say she believed she'd been the
</p>
<p>death of that girl. And right in the middle of it
</p>
<p>she had regular hysterics, and she just sat on the
</p>
<p>sofa and wrung her hands and screams out, ' Oh,
</p>
<p>I'm wicked ! wicked ! wicked ! I'd give my life to
</p>
<p>undo what I have done ! Oh, will nothing come to
</p>
<p>my relief ? Oh, I'm dying by inches ! "
</p>
<p>Thomas and Lamm exchanged puzzled and
</p>
<p>startled glances.
</p>
<p>" There is no question," said the detective in a
</p>
<p>low voice, " that Marion accused herself in such
</p>
<p>language ? "
</p>
<p>" Not the faintest," said Miss White positively.
</p>
<p>" That part of it is quite certain. She cried it out
</p>
<p>so loud it's a wonder folk in the street didn't hear
</p>
<p>her. And then he grasps her hand and says,
</p>
<p>' Come Marion ; you must no longer keep me in
</p>
<p>the dark. You must tell me everything even if
</p>
<p>it does criminate he whom the world calls your
</p>
<p>husband.' "
</p>
<p>" No ! " interrupted both men at once. " He
</p>
<p>didn't say that, did he ? "

<p>" He used them words," said Miss White, with a
</p>

</p>
<p>positiveness that set at defiance both doubt and
</p>
<p>syntax. "'And he was very particular about it too.
</p>
<p>I can tell you, I had both my ears wide open about
</p>
<p>that time. And she didn't seem to hear him, but
</p>
<p>kept right on. ' And, oh ! Richard,' she said, ' do
</p>
<p>you suppose anything, any provocation, the worst
</p>
<p>treatment you can imagine a person to have received
</p>
<p>at another person's hands would justify a mean
</p>
<p>and cowardly crime ? ' And with that he starts
</p>
<p>away from her, and she shrieks out, ' Oh, for pity's
</p>
<p>sake, don't cast me off ! I am tortured beyond
</p>
<p>bearing ! ' ' Confess,' he says, and she threw her
</p>
<p>arms right around his neck and whispered in his
</p>
<p>ear. And just at that moment I was nearly fright-
</p>
<p>ened to death by hearing the latch lock. I knew
</p>
<p>if I stayed I'd be caught the next minute, and so
</p>
<p>I ran. It was Miss Harwood, and I was none too
</p>
<p>soon, either, for she lit the hall."
</p>
<p>" Confound Miss Harwood ! " said the detective
</p>
<p>heartily. " She has spoiled everything for us."
</p>
<p>" Yes ; and for them too," said the parlor maid.
</p>
<p>" For Mr. Fetridge did not stay five minutes after
</p>
<p>she came."
</p>
<p>" Did you see him when he went ? How did he
</p>
<p>act ? " Lamm hastened to ask.
</p>
<p>" Just as usual ; only a bit excited. I'm sure of
</p>
<p>one thing, sir. Whatever she whispered to him, it
</p>
<p>didn't set him against her, for if he didn't squeeze
</p>
<p>her hand and look into her eyes the way he had no
</p>
<p>business to when he left her then I'm no judge of

</p>
<p>The rest of that which the parlor maid had to
</p>
<p>tell was merely accumulative and corroboratory of
</p>
<p>what she had already told. Mr. Lamm satisfied
</p>
<p>himself of this fact by a cross-examination, inter-
</p>
<p>spersed with sly compliments, and sent the wide-
</p>
<p>awake Molly White away at last, well pleased with
</p>
<p>herself, to resume, with increased vigilance, her
</p>
<p>watch of Marion Stackhouse.
</p>
<p>" And now," said the detective, hastily turning
</p>
<p>to Thomas as soon as they were alone, " it remains
</p>
<p>for us to find out what Mrs. Marion has written,
</p>
<p>and meant to write, to her husband. I must say it
</p>
<p>is a very unpromising task, but it is so important
</p>
<p>that it must be attempted."
</p>
<p>" Very well," said Thomas, " if you'll attend to
</p>
<p>the letters which she destroyed, I'll turn my atten-
</p>
<p>tion to the one she mailed. It is but eleven o'clock,
</p>
<p>and I doubt whether Stackhouse has received it

<p>yet."
</p>
<p>" You had better be in a hurry, then."
</p>
<p>" I am going," said Thomas ; " but before I go I
</p>
<p>want to know what you think. Is your conviction
</p>
<p>still that a conspiracy existed, and that Marion
</p>
<p>North was the brains of it ? "
</p>
<p>"A hasty judgment is liable to recall," returned
</p>
<p>the detective ; " but I must confess that I still
</p>
<p>believe in the conspiracy. But I bow to the facts

<p>" Because I don't."

<p>John Lamm laughed.
</p>
<p>" I could give a better reason than that for your

<p>reluctance to accept the evidence," he said. " But
</p>
<p>never mind. By the way, I want to tell you some-
</p>
<p>thing that will make you smile. Where I got it

<p>don't matter ; but, as you know, I've got a friend

</p>
<p>" Well, I'll tell you, Thomas. It's a good joke

</p>
<p>" I'm afraid you show your prejudice against the
</p>
<p>department there, Lamm. But never mind the
</p>
<p>details. What was the outcome of it ? "
</p>
<p>" The outcome," said Lamm, with a quiet laugh,
</p>
<p>" was that Applebee found the scent on Stella
</p>
<p>North, and the whole department, without further
</p>
<p>investigation, with their accustomed lightning-like
</p>
<p>celerity jumped to the conclusion that Stella North
</p>
<p>was the guilty party."
</p>
<p>"Humph!" ejaculated the reporter; "they
</p>
<p>couldn't have gone very far if they did not dis-
</p>
<p>cover that the two girls used the same perfume. I
</p>
<p>found that out on my first visit."
</p>
<p>" Umha ! Applebee wasn't so lucky. The hand-
</p>
<p>kerchief was Marion's, of course. But a little mis-
</p>
<p>take like that doesn't count with the department, I
</p>
<p>suppose. All in the family. But, joking aside,
</p>
<p>Thomas, the fact has a most serious side too."
</p>
<p>"You think so."

</p>
<p>woman at Swampscott. Thomas, I'm sorry for her.
</p>
<p>1 really am. I admire her too much not to pity her."

<p>a feverish anxiety to convict her of a crime that is
</p>
<p>THE MEDEA WEEPS. 295
</p>
<p>utterly impossible for a woman of her nature to
</p>
<p>commit."
</p>
<p>" Impossible ? "
</p>
<p>" Impossible ! "
</p>
<p>" Even in a moment of passion ? "
</p>
<p>" She would have been the first to convict herself,
</p>
<p>to give herself up, when the passion was over."
</p>
<p>"Even, we will say, in a struggle to prevent
</p>
<p>suicide even by accident, if you please ? "
</p>
<p>" Do not imagine for a moment that she would
</p>
<p>have concealed her part in the crime, Lamm. I
</p>
<p>tell you the more I study this woman's nature
</p>
<p>through her sister Stella the more I am convinced
</p>
<p>that she worshiped the very ground Paul North
</p>
<p>trod upon. If she were guilty, even in the most
</p>
<p>indirect manner, of bringing about his death, the
</p>
<p>world would have known of the fatality that night."
</p>
<p>Lamm sighed and shook his head.
</p>
<p>" I hate to destroy your confidence in Stella
</p>
<p>North's sister, Thomas, but I should not be doing
</p>
<p>my duty by you as a friend if I kept back what
</p>
<p>little I know of the matter. Let me ask you one
</p>
<p>question. Do you believe in hereditary vices.
</p>
<p>" To some extent. Why ? "
</p>
<p>Without replying immediately in words, the de-
</p>
<p>tective unlocked his desk and afterward a small
</p>
<p>drawer in the upper part of it, whence he extracted
</p>
<p>a folded document of legal aspect.

<p>and key again.

<p>DRAWING THE NET.
</p>
<p>AND now Reporter Thomas was making a deter-
</p>
<p>mined though apparently hopeless effort to
</p>
<p>obtain possession of the letter which Marion Stack-
</p>
<p>house had written to her husband. Not only hope-
</p>
<p>less the quest seemed, but dangerous. In the
</p>
<p>ordinary routine of his duties he would hesitatingly
</p>
<p>have rejected an enterprise of so obnoxious and
</p>
<p>disagreeable a nature. But the case was becoming
</p>
<p>desperate and it was no longer a business, no
</p>
<p>longer even a personal interest. The mournful
</p>
<p>pleading of the big blue eyes of Stella North
</p>
<p>nerved him for the ignoble task. The remem-
</p>
<p>brance of some tears which he had seen that
</p>
<p>morning trembling on the long lashes stimulated
</p>
<p>him to unprecedented effort. He was in that mood
</p>
<p>where to obtain success he would stop at nothing
</p>
<p>short of crime. He hardly knew himself in this
</p>
<p>new rdle ; but he played the spy and the sneak
</p>
<p>that day as he never played it before or since.
</p>
<p>It was easy enough to assure himself of the
</p>
<p>existence of the letter.

<p>Thomas was walking boldly to the desk at the
</p>
<p>Adams House.
</p>
<p>" Good-morning," said the clerk, for it was not
</p>
<p>yet noon of this eventful Saturday.
</p>
<p>' Good-morning," said Thomas. " Can you tell
</p>
<p>me whether Mr. Stackhouse is in the hotel ? "
</p>
<p>" Not in his room," returned the clerk, with a
</p>
<p>queer smile. " His key is here."
</p>
<p>" Curious ! " said Thomas, with an assumption
</p>
<p>of troubled reflection. " I wonder if he's got my
</p>
<p>letter. I wrote him a letter last night and posted
</p>
<p>it at Swampscott," he continued by way of explan-
</p>
<p>ation. " Can you tell me whether he has it yet ? "
</p>
<p>The clerk took a look in the pigeon hole marked
</p>
<p>" S " and Thomas caught a momentary glimpse of a
</p>
<p>square, white envelope in his hand. But the clerk
</p>
<p>cast it back immediately and turned to the rescrter.
</p>
<p>" There is a letter for him here with the Swamp-
</p>
<p>scott postmark," he said. " It may be yours."
</p>
<p>" A square, cream white envelope ? " queried
</p>
<p>Thomas, " that looks like a piece of woman's
</p>
<p>stationery ? "
</p>
<p>" Yes."
</p>
<p>" Ah, that's the one ! He hasn't got it. Thank
</p>
<p>you."
</p>
<p>" Are you going to wait and see him ? " the
</p>
<p>clerk inquired, with another smile.
</p>
<p>" Why ? " asked Thomas, scenting something
</p>
<p>unusual.

</p>
<p>" Indeed ! And where are they all ?"
</p>
<p>" Oh, waiting about here."
</p>
<p>" Business men? "
</p>
<p>" Well, they have that look. Since the failure
</p>
<p>Mr. Stackhouse seems to have been considerably
</p>
<p>in demand."
</p>
<p>" Oh, I see."
</p>
<p>" Consequently, if it's anything important you'd
</p>
<p>do well to hunt him up, as this letter is likely to be
</p>
<p>here some time."
</p>
<p>Thomas thanked his informant. As he turned
</p>
<p>away from the desk a daring subterfuge by which
</p>
<p>he might obtain possession of the letter came into
</p>
<p>his mind, but he dismissed it with impatient horror.
</p>
<p>" What am I thinking of?" he exclaimed men-
</p>
<p>tall}'. " Forgery ! Tampering with the mail ! I
</p>
<p>must season my impetuosity with a little reason."
</p>
<p>He sauntered out as far as the doorway, and
</p>
<p>stood there in a brown study.
</p>
<p>" No, there is nothing for me to do," he thought,
</p>
<p>" but to wait here for the man to claim his letter,
</p>
<p>however long that may be. I must trust to luck
</p>
<p>and a determined effort to get me a glance at it
</p>
<p>after he has read it."
</p>
<p>The warning of the clerk made the outcome look
</p>
<p>dubious. These men waiting about here must be
</p>
<p>creditors or business associates who had pressing
</p>
<p>reasons to see Stackhouse. The clerk's significant

</p>
<p>or these men would not come here to wait for him.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless if his wife had sent the letter thither,
</p>
<p>it must be because he had directed her to do so.
</p>
<p>If he deemed it a matter of so much importance,
</p>
<p>as John Lamm imagined, would he not find some
</p>
<p>way of obtaining his mail without calling ?
</p>
<p>It was at the precise moment when this thought
</p>
<p>was taking form in the reporter's mind that he
</p>
<p>observed a district messenger boy leaving the office.
</p>
<p>The boy was just putting his hat upon his head,
</p>
<p>and Thomas caught a fleeting glimpse of a square,
</p>
<p>white envelope.
</p>
<p>In an instant he comprehended what must have
</p>
<p>taken place since he had left the desk. Thornton
</p>
<p>Stackhouse had sent a requisition to the clerk for
</p>
<p>his mail. A word at the desk confirmed the re-
</p>
<p>porter's suspicions, and in another minute he was
</p>
<p>upon the heels of the messenger. His task at pres-
</p>
<p>ent seemed simplicity itself. To follow this mes-
</p>
<p>senger boy till he was finally led into the presence
</p>
<p>of the man whose commission he executed was a
</p>
<p>task that certainly called for none of the higher ex-
</p>
<p>pedients of Mr. Thomas's genius.
</p>
<p>The boy took a course southward and continued
</p>
<p>straight up Washington Street until he reached
</p>
<p>Union Park Street, when he turned short to the
</p>
<p>right, and a few minutes afterward entered the
</p>
<p>door of a drinking saloon in Shawmut Avenue.
</p>
<p>Thomas had no special associations with the place,
</p>
<p>though he knew of it in a general way. Taking the

</p>
<p>anybody who might be on the watch an idea that
</p>
<p>there was anything other than a coincidence in his
</p>
<p>arrival on the heels of the messenger boy, Thomas
</p>
<p>loitered into the place and passed directly into the
</p>
<p>bar, where he called for a drink. There were two
</p>
<p>or three men standing at the bar, but at the
</p>
<p>moment of his entrance nothing was to be seen
</p>
<p>either of the messenger or of Thornton Stackhouse.
</p>
<p>A number of booths ranged along the side of the
</p>
<p>room opposite the bar, however, attracted his atten-
</p>
<p>tion, and, in accordance with his surmises, Mr.
</p>
<p>Thomas was pleased very shortly to see the mes-
</p>
<p>senger emerge from one of these places. The boy
</p>
<p>had scarcely passed out when the reporter, swal-
</p>
<p>lowing at a gulp the beverage which he had ordered,
</p>
<p>placed the payment therefor upon the counter, and
</p>
<p>lounged down past the compartment from which
</p>
<p>the boy had issued.
</p>
<p>His expectations were entirely correct. There
</p>
<p>sat Thornton Stackhouse reading devouring would
</p>
<p>be a more accurate word the letter which had
</p>
<p>been posted at Swampscott the night before.
</p>
<p>Fearful of attracting attention, Thomas increased
</p>
<p>his pace, but precautions were needless. The man
</p>
<p>was absorbed, completely oblivious to all his sur-
</p>
<p>roundings. Even in the momentary glimpse he
</p>
<p>had of him the reporter was startled into the belief
</p>
<p>that the contents of the letter had utterly over-
</p>
<p>whelmed and dazed the man who had received it.
</p>
<p>The paper was crumpled fiercely between his hands,
</p>
<p>and he was glaring at it with scarcely the look of

</p>
<p>sanity in his eyes.
</p>
<p>32 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>Thomas slipped hastily into the next booth. The
</p>
<p>brief vision which had just been granted him was
</p>
<p>certainly not calculated to lessen his idea of the
</p>
<p>importance of the document of which he was in
</p>
<p>quest, or to shake his determination to become
</p>
<p>possessed of it.
</p>
<p>But how ?
</p>
<p>This was a problem which might well puzzle Mr.
</p>
<p>Thomas. The greater the importance of the letter
</p>
<p>the more carefully would its possessor guard it. If
</p>
<p>he destroyed it, there was little hope that so shrewd
</p>
<p>a man as Stackhouse would be satisfied with leav-
</p>
<p>ing it in a condition which would not preclude its
</p>
<p>restoration. If he carried it away with him, under
</p>
<p>what possible pretence could the reporter get it?
</p>
<p>He certainly could not ask him for it: he was
</p>
<p>scarcely prepared even in his present fever of eager-
</p>
<p>ness to resort to violence. Were he so inclined,
</p>
<p>how could he even hope for the opportunity of steal-
</p>
<p>ing it? Nevertheless, Thomas compressed his lips
</p>
<p>and waited patiently the unpredictable course of
</p>
<p>events.
</p>
<p>He had not long to wait for a change in the situ-
</p>
<p>ation. He heard Stackhouse crushing the paper
</p>
<p>and murmuring undistinguishable words below his
</p>
<p>breath. Then again, he fancied, from the sounds,
</p>
<p>that the man had risen to his feet and was leav-
</p>
<p>ing the booth. A cautious reconnoitring assured
</p>
<p>the reporter that he was correct in this surmise.
</p>
<p>Stackhouse had passed to the bar, and he heard him

</p>
<p>in no very steady voice asking for brandy. Where
</p>
<p>DRAWING THE NET. 33
</p>
<p>was the letter? Actuated by an absurd hope, the
</p>
<p>reporter slipped into the booth which Stackhouse
</p>
<p>had just vacated. A minute's search assured him
</p>
<p>that Stackhouse had not committed the unpardona-
</p>
<p>ble indiscretion of leaving even the remnants of the
</p>
<p>document upon the floor. Undoubtedly he had
</p>
<p>not torn it up, but had replaced it bodily in his
</p>
<p>pocket.
</p>
<p>After drinking the brandy, Stackhouse went out,
</p>
<p>and the reporter followed him from the saloon.
</p>
<p>Thomas was not, however, so absorbed in the
</p>
<p>actions of his intended victim that he was oblivious
</p>
<p>to other things. It was quite obvious to him that
</p>
<p>two of the men who had been lounging at the bar
</p>
<p>suddenly became alert and lost all interest in the
</p>
<p>place as soon as Stackhouse had left it. So eager
</p>
<p>were they to get into the street that they jostled Mr.
</p>
<p>Thomas on their way. They were ordinary-look-
</p>
<p>ing men. Nothing about them was calculated to
</p>
<p>linger in the memory or to attract a second glance.
</p>
<p>One of them sauntered over to the other side of the
</p>
<p>street. The other kept along just in front of
</p>
<p>Thomas.
</p>
<p>The reporter frowned. These details were no
</p>
<p>enigma to him. He recognized at once the precau-
</p>
<p>tionary measures of the police department. These,
</p>
<p>then, were Thomas Stackhouse's constant compan-
</p>
<p>ions, and the reporter realized that their presence
</p>
<p>made his quest, if not more dangerous, at least
</p>
<p>vastly more difficult.

</p>
<p>Still he went on. The detectives followed Stack-

</p>
<p>house. Thomas followed the detectives. Did
</p>
<p>Stackhouse know of his double espionage? There
</p>
<p>were no evidences that he did or that he cared one
</p>
<p>way or the other. He went forward at a good pace,
</p>
<p>his eyes always downward or straight ahead. What
</p>
<p>a walk he was leading them ! Apparently he had
</p>
<p>forgotten that there were any means of conveyance
</p>
<p>about the city. Ignoring alike horse cars and cabs,
</p>
<p>Thorton Stackhouse went from the barroom in
</p>
<p>Shawmut Avenue to the Chelsea Ferry, at the foot
</p>
<p>of Hanover Street. The four men, who were not
</p>
<p>all conscious of their association of interest, passed
</p>
<p>upon the ferry-boat together.
</p>
<p>After the boat was out in the stream, for the
</p>
<p>first time Stackhouse's conduct became suspicious.
</p>
<p>He glanced about him, and wandered from point
</p>
<p>to point, apparently with two objects in view. He
</p>
<p>seemed to be trying to get as far as possible from
</p>
<p>other people, and as near as possible to the rail.
</p>
<p>A dark suspicion entered the reporter's mind.
</p>
<p>Was Thornton Stackhouse contemplating suicide?
</p>
<p>Whether or not, it was not at all necessary for him
</p>
<p>to interfere. Circumstances happily enabled him to
</p>
<p>watch the proceedings from a safe distance, for the
</p>
<p>two detectives, doubtless imbued with the same
</p>
<p>suspicion which had occurred to Thomas, kept close
</p>
<p>upon the heels of the unfortunate man. Evidently
</p>
<p>they had no intention of permitting their prey to
</p>
<p>escape them, even through the medium of violent
</p>
<p>death. Justice inexorably endeavors to close even
</p>
<p>this door of refuge to the victims whom she pro-

</p>
<p>Stackhouse once lost his temper. He turned
</p>
<p>hotly upon one of his tormentors.
</p>
<p>"Come, sir!" he said, in a voice of suppressed
</p>
<p>passion. "End this farce. If my safety is so im-
</p>
<p>portant to you, arrest me and have done with it!"
</p>
<p>The man regarded him with a cold stare.
</p>
<p>"Excuse me, sir," he said gruffly. "I don't
</p>
<p>know you."
</p>
<p>The officer shrugged his shoulders, and turned
</p>
<p>indifferently to a view of the landscape. Stack-
</p>
<p>house bit his lip; his anger vanished; he became
</p>
<p>moody. His eyes were cast down, and he no longer
</p>
<p>looked about him.
</p>
<p>When the ferry-boat reached the other side, the
</p>
<p>ruined banker disembarked, and for a time wandered
</p>
<p>aimlessly about the water front. His hands were
</p>
<p>clasped behind him and his head hung down. He
</p>
<p>walked like an old man.
</p>
<p>With the same outward bearing he took a ferry-
</p>
<p>boat back to the city, and set out once more upon
</p>
<p>one of his interminable walks. There was a new
</p>
<p>feature added to his conduct. At nearly every
</p>
<p>drinking saloon he stopped and ordered liquor.
</p>
<p>His walk became unsteady, but he went on like a
</p>
<p>man who had a definite end in view. The frequent
</p>
<p>visits to the saloons puzzled Thomas at first. Sud-
</p>
<p>denly he had an inspiration.
</p>
<p>"The letter from his wife was a terrible blow to
</p>
<p>him. He seeks oblivion. This is his second effort
</p>
<p>to obtain it. The first was death, and it was denied

</p>
<p>36 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>effective, and will be secured when he has imbibed
</p>
<p>a sufficient quantity of alcohol!"
</p>
<p>Thomas began to have a vague hope. His sus-
</p>
<p>picions became certainty very soon. Thornton
</p>
<p>Stackhouse entered at last a third-class hotel at the _
</p>
<p>North End, and paid for a room. The call boy
</p>
<p>came down after a few minutes for a bottle of
</p>
<p>brandy, and Stackhouse locked himself in the room
</p>
<p>with it.
</p>
<p>Even the experienced Thomas shuddered. That
</p>
<p>a man who had occupied the position in the world
</p>
<p>of the late junior partner of North & Stackhouse
</p>
<p>should be reduced to an extremity of this kind, filled
</p>
<p>him with a feeling akin to pity. But nothing shook
</p>
<p>his resolution. Whether it tended to save this
</p>
<p>miserable exile from respectability or to give him
</p>
<p>the final kick which should destroy his last hold of
</p>
<p>the bushes on the brink of the precipice, the bit of
</p>
<p>evidence now in Stackhouse's possession must be
</p>
<p>secured.
</p>
<p>A private word or two in the ear of the proprie-
</p>
<p>tor secured the reporter a room on the second floor,
</p>
<p>immediately adjoining that occupied by the man in
</p>
<p>whom all his interest centered. There was a com-
</p>
<p>municating door, but it was locked on the other
</p>
<p>side. Against this door the reporter remained lis-
</p>
<p>tening, conjecturing, planning, for quite two hours.
</p>
<p>The audible evidences of Stackhouse's presence
</p>
<p>had for some time ceased. Thomas realized that it
</p>
<p>was time to act.

</p>
<p>He began a great clamor upon the do'or. There
</p>
<p>DRAWING THE NET. 37
</p>
<p>was not a sound in answer. Thomas left his room,
</p>
<p>and sought out the proprietor.
</p>
<p>"You know me, don't you Thomas, of the
</p>
<p>Globe ? Ah! Well, I want to save you trouble.
</p>
<p>There is every reason to believe that that man in the
</p>
<p>room next to mine has made away with himself."
</p>
<p>" No ! " exclaimed the proprietor, aghast.
</p>
<p>" Quite so, sir. I have suspected him for some
</p>
<p>time. I can account for the sounds I have heard
</p>
<p>in no other manner. They suddenly ceased, and for
</p>
<p>some time I have been making noise enough to raise
</p>
<p>the dead. He doesn't respond."
</p>
<p>Within four minutes the door of Mr. Stackhouse's
</p>
<p>room was forced, and half a dozen men rushed into
</p>
<p>the chamber. Stackhouse lay upon the bed, mo-
</p>
<p>tionless. His coat and vest were thrown carelessly

</p>
<p>" He is drunk ! " cried one of the detectives.

<p>r
</p>
<p>" He is dying," said Thomas. " Where are his
</p>
<p>papers ? We must have his name."
</p>
<p>With admirable coolness before them all, Thomas
</p>
<p>took a pocket-book from the coat which lay upon
</p>
<p>the chair, and was proceeding to investigate its
</p>
<p>contents.
</p>
<p>An authoritative hand was suddenly laid upon
</p>
<p>his shoulder, and one of the detectives whispered
</p>
<p>in his ear :
</p>
<p>" Are you crazy, Thomas ? What is the matter
</p>
<p>with you ? You know well enough who the man is.

<p>The reporter had a faint flush in his cheeks, but
</p>
<p>he yielded without protest.
</p>
<p>The square white envelope was already in his

<p>possession.
</p>
<p>An hour later he read the letter. Its contents
</p>
<p>filled him with astonishment and excitement. It
</p>
<p>was certainly not what he expected, but it seemed
</p>
<p>to him pregnant with possibilities. He hastened to
</p>
<p>find John Lamm ; but the office of the detective
</p>
<p>was closed, and he was unable to locate him.

<p>" It's fate ! " cried Thomas. " I shall act alone,

<p>and her sister Marion ! "

<p>CHAPTER XXIV.
</p>
<p>"NAME THE MAN."
</p>
<p>MONDAY morning, eleven days exactly from
</p>
<p>that last and memorable meeting of the direct-
</p>
<p>ors of the Nicaragua Midland, when Paul North's
</p>
<p>coming was awaited in vain, Thornton Stackhouse
</p>
<p>staggered into the office of Detective Lamm.
</p>
<p>A few hours had wrought a great change in the
</p>
<p>man a change for the worst. Careworn before,
</p>
<p>he was now absolutely haggard. But one look
</p>
<p>was needed to assure Mr. Lamm that his visitor
</p>
<p>had passed a sleepless, wretched night.
</p>
<p>Unmistakable signs of debauch, too, were to be
</p>
<p>observed. His lips twitched strangely; the lines of
</p>
<p>his anxious face were more deeply drawn ; an un-
</p>
<p>healthy, blotched redness had taken the place of
</p>
<p>once healthy color, and there was an incessant
</p>
<p>trembling of the hands, unusual and ominous.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm, with a good deal of concern ex-
</p>
<p>pressed in his look, sprang up to greet him, and
</p>
<p>assisted the man to a chair.
</p>
<p>" Why, Mr. Stackhouse," he exclaimed, " you
</p>
<p>are not well. Why did you come down town this
</p>
<p>morning ? You should have sent for me. You
</p>
<p>are in no condition to be out in the street on such

</p>
<p>a warm day. Let me call a carriage. I will go
</p>
<p>down to your room at the Adams House and talk
</p>
<p>with you there, if you like."
</p>
<p>Thornton Stackhouse shook his head and put
</p>
<p>out a trembling hand.
</p>
<p>" No no," he said huskily. " You are very
</p>
<p>good to think of it. Perhaps I should not have
</p>
<p>left my room. But the hotel is a horror to me, sir.
</p>
<p>I cannot set foot in the hall without meeting
</p>
<p>the scowling face of some creditor of North &
</p>
<p>Stackhouse. People point after me as I walk
</p>
<p>along, and talk under their breath about me. Fools!
</p>
<p>They think I do not see these things. I am fol-
</p>
<p>lowed here, there, and everywhere, hounded like an
</p>
<p>escaped convict. Saturday I lay down on a bed,
</p>
<p>and they broke open my room to make sure I had
</p>
<p>not escaped them ! I thank you, Mr. Lamm, for
</p>
<p>all that you have done and meant to do for me.
</p>
<p>But I have made up my mind not to endure this
</p>
<p>life any longer. I am going away."
</p>
<p>" Nonsense ! " returned Mr. Lamm cheerfully,
</p>
<p>with his hand on the man's shoulder, but looking
</p>
<p>anxiously, none the less, into his haggard face.
</p>
<p>" Stick to your colors a little longer. The fight is
</p>
<p>almost over."
</p>
<p>" Almost over ! " Stackhouse echoed the words
</p>
<p>with a curious, dull intonation. " My hopes of
</p>
<p>happiness are wrecked. The future is dark all
</p>
<p>dark. The shadow of crime, once it falls on a
</p>
<p>man's life, can never be lifted. You know how

</p>
<p>terribly true that is, Mr. Lamm. This is no more
</p>
<p>"NAME THE MAN." 31 1
</p>
<p>than my just deserts. No more. Yes, I am going
</p>
<p>away. Whatever the risk I care not. Why should
</p>
<p>I stay in this city of torment ? "
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm gave another friendly touch upon the
</p>
<p>shoulder of the dejected figure, but his own look of
</p>
<p>anxiety was only intensified.
</p>
<p>M Wait ! " said the detective, in tones of sympathy.
</p>
<p>" The truth is coming, and it is coming fast. You
</p>
<p>have trusted me so far. Don't cast my advice to
</p>
<p>the winds now."
</p>
<p>" I do not care the turn of my hand whether the
</p>
<p>truth comes out to-day or to-morrow, or never,"
</p>
<p>gloomily answered Stackhouse, looking at the face
</p>
<p>bent near his own, with hollow, despairing eyes.
</p>
<p>" I have no longer any interest in any possible
</p>
<p>event that may happen to me. But out of this hor-
</p>
<p>rible place and these horrible surroundings I mean
</p>
<p>to go, and without delay. Mr. Lamm, I thank
</p>
<p>you again for the noble way in which you have
</p>
<p>helped me."
</p>
<p>" Don't speak of that," interposed Mr. Lamm.
</p>
<p>" I must speak of it. In all my trouble and
</p>
<p>remorse I have not forgotten it. And now let me
</p>

</p>
<p>check for the amount at once the last check that
</p>
<p>Thornton Stackhouse will ever fill out in Boston."
</p>
<p>" My dear sir," Mr. Lamm remonstrated, " I have
</p>
<p>no bill to present. Why, my work is not done yet.
</p>
<p>When the proper time comes I shall not forget it,
</p>
<p>be sure of that," he added, with assumed lightness

<p>312 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>Stackhouse got up rather unsteadily, but with a
</p>
<p>filled purpose in his look.
</p>
<p>" Let me go into your inner office," he asked,
</p>
<p>" and make out a check if it's only as a matter of
</p>
<p>form. Besides, I want to write a moment on
</p>
<p>another matter, and I should like to be undisturbed
</p>
<p>by any chance caller you might have."
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm was at the door of his little " den "
</p>
<p>in a moment, opened his desk, and placed pen and
</p>
<p>paper at his visitor's disposal. Stackhouse sat
</p>
<p>down, and the detective went out, softly closing the
</p>
<p>door upon the client at his work.
</p>
<p>Roused from certain regretful momentary medi-
</p>
<p>tations by the entrance of his trusted worker,
</p>
<p>" Bill," Mr. Lamm began to talk with him in an
</p>
<p>undertone.
</p>
<p>In the very middle of their hushed conference,
</p>
<p>both men started, and looked wildly around.
</p>
<p>The sound of an explosion came to their ears
</p>
<p>with terrible distinctness.
</p>
<p>It was unmistakably a pistol shot.
</p>
<p>Moved by a common impulse, both rushed
</p>
<p>toward the inner office. When Detective Lamm
</p>
<p>pushed open the door and went in, his subordinate
</p>
<p>was close behind.
</p>
<p>The room was full of smoke. But the cloud
</p>
<p>lifted as the current of fresher air entered, and in
</p>
<p>an instant the two were staring into a face a face
</p>
<p>that did not return their look of horror, the face of
</p>
<p>a dead man.

<p>Dead ! Sitting up in his chair at Mr. Lamm's
</p>
<p>"NAME THE MAN." 313
</p>
<p>desk, with one hand clutching a pen, and in the
</p>
<p>other a revolver, from which a tiny wreath
</p>
<p>of smoke was curling, was the form of Thornton
</p>
<p>Stackhouse.
</p>
<p>So true had been his aim that the transition from
</p>
<p>life to death could have taken scarcely a second
</p>
<p>of time. He had blown out his brains.
</p>
<p>With a stifled cry Mr. Lamm's companion
</p>
<p>started back. His white face met at the outer
</p>
<p>door the frightened look of another man, a convey-
</p>
<p>ancer, who had an office close by.
</p>
<p>" A man has shot himself in there ! " whispered
</p>
<p>Bill. The new comer hurried out of the room.
</p>
<p>Others, alarmed at the report of the pistol, were
</p>
<p>hurrying to the scene ; and in an incredibly short
</p>
<p>space of time every occupant of the building
</p>
<p>seemed to be possessed of the startling news.
</p>
<p>John Lamm quickly regained his accustomed
</p>
<p>composure, and barred the outer door in advance
</p>
<p>of the rush of the excited throng which he knew
</p>
<p>was coming.
</p>
<p>He returned, a moment later, to the little room,
</p>
<p>paying not the slightest heed to the crush without,
</p>
<p>or to the loud and reiterated demands : " Let us
</p>
<p>in ! Let us in ! "
</p>
<p>In the dead man's clenched hand, which Mr.
</p>
<p>Lamm made no attempt to unclasp, was held
</p>
<p>a 32-calibre revolver. The other hand held
</p>
<p>a pen.
</p>
<p>Written on the blotter of the desk was this, the

<p>last message of Thornton Stackhouse :
</p>
<p>314 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>" Send for my wife, Marion Stackhouse.
</p>
<p>" Tell her my death is my reparation.
</p>
<p>" I can forgive her if she can forgive me. But I cannot
</p>
<p>live without her."
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm read the words, and gave a look full
</p>
<p>of pity at the motionless figure sitting there so
</p>
<p>near him, yet in an awful sense so far removed.
</p>
<p>The stentorian demand at the outer door had
</p>
<p>ceased when he re-entered his main office, but there
</p>
<p>was a dull murmuring, which grew to a very babel
</p>
<p>of excited sound when Mr. Lamm's form was seen
</p>
<p>on the threshold.
</p>
<p>Two men were standing close to the door, having
</p>
<p>apparently been given that post of distinction by
</p>
<p>common consent of the crowd, who held back a
</p>
<p>little way.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm knew his men at once.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen," he said gravely, " you are out-
</p>
<p>witted ! "
</p>
<p>They made a pretense of misunderstanding him.
</p>
<p>"What do you mean ?" said the older man.
</p>
<p>" I mean," returned the detective quietly, " that
</p>
<p>you can inform your inspector that your services
</p>
<p>will be no longer necessary. The inner room, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen."
</p>
<p>He waved his hand for them to enter.
</p>
<p>They hurried in. In another minute one of
</p>
<p>them came out, forced his way through the in-
</p>
<p>creasing throng which blocked the entrance, and
</p>
<p>hurried after Inspector Applebee.

</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm turned gravely to his assistant.
</p>
<p>"NAME THE MAN." 3*5
</p>
<p>" Go to Richard Fetridge's office," he said in a
</p>
<p>low tone, " and have him here at once. Don't ex-
</p>
<p>plain. Don't listen to any excuses for delay."
</p>
<p>The man pushed through the crowd and was off
</p>
<p>like a shot.
</p>
<p>Both messengers were signally successful.
</p>
<p>To the immense satisfaction of the breathless
</p>
<p>officer in citizen's clothes, he met Inspector Apple-
</p>
<p>bee coming down the street holding his course
</p>
<p>directly in the line taken by Mr. Lamm's messenger.
</p>
<p>Two words, and the inspector hurried toward the
</p>
<p>scene of death, and found his way through the press.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm, waiting at the door, bowed and ad-
</p>
<p>mitted him at once.
</p>
<p>With Inspector Applebee and his man, a great
</p>
<p>surge of excited humanity rushed into Mr. Lamm's
</p>
<p>office. Only by dint of the most active exertions
</p>
<p>could the police keep back the eager crowd from
</p>
<p>the little room.
</p>
<p>Presently there was a stir at the outer door.
</p>
<p>Attention was diverted for the moment from what
</p>
<p>the little room contained of animate or inanimate
</p>
<p>humanity, as Mr. Fetridge, visibly excited, entered
</p>
<p>the office under the guidance of Mr. Lamm's
</p>
<p>messenger.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm, counting upon his speedy coming,
</p>
<p>was on the watch, and with the co-operation of
</p>
<p>Inspector Applebee, to whom the detective deferred
</p>
<p>as being the representative of authority, Richard
</p>
<p>Fetridge was admitted to the inner room.

</p>
<p>" A horrible sight ! " he murmured, putting his
</p>
<p>31 6 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>hands before his face, and leaning against one of
</p>
<p>the officers. In a few moments he had recovered,
</p>
<p>but avoided, as much as he could, turning any
</p>
<p>glance toward the desk.
</p>
<p>" Do you remember what Daniel Webster said
</p>
<p>once ? " Fetridge spoke to Mr. Lamm under his
</p>
<p>breath, but not so low that the listening ear of In-
</p>
<p>spector Applebee did not catch every word :
</p>
<p>" ' There is no refuge for the murderer but suicide.
</p>
<p>And suicide is confession ! ' '
</p>
<p>Hardly was the sentence uttered, when Inspector
</p>
<p>Applebee, as if aroused by some sudden thought,
</p>
<p>ordered the officers to clear the outer room and to
</p>
<p>prevent further blockade upon the stairway.
</p>
<p>" Not you, of course," said the inspector, address-
</p>
<p>ing generally the little group.
</p>
<p>No word was spoken by them while the orders
</p>
<p>were carried out, not without some difficulty. When
</p>
<p>the room was cleared at last, the inspector motioned
</p>
<p>to one of his men to remain by the body, and led
</p>
<p>the way into the larger room, Mr. Lamm and Mr.
</p>
<p>Fetridge following in turn.
</p>
<p>Taking no note of the detective, Inspector Apple-
</p>
<p>bee wheeled upon his companion and clapped a
</p>
<p>firm hand on his arm.
</p>
<p>" I am sorry to have to say it, Mr. Fetridge,
</p>
<p>but I must take you into custody."
</p>
<p>Richard Fetridge stood aghast, unable to articu-
</p>
<p>late a syllable.
</p>
<p>Self-poised as ever, Mr. Lamm took his cue to

</p>
<p>" Inspector Applebee," he said very coolly, " it is
</p>
<p>not my business, perhaps, but you are sure that in
</p>
<p>arresting Mr. Fetridge you are not making a mis-
</p>
<p>take ? "
</p>
<p>The inspector put on at once his invisible robe
</p>
<p>of official dignity.
</p>
<p>" I think I know what I am about, Mr. Lamm."
</p>
<p>He was very curt.
</p>
<p>" Oh, no doubt, no doubt, Mr. Inspector," re-
</p>
<p>sponded the private detective.
</p>
<p>" Of course, if you are possessed of any infor-
</p>
<p>mation, sir, the authorities will be glad to have you
</p>
<p>disclose it." Thus Inspector Applebee still, with
</p>
<p>his official manner emphasized.
</p>
<p>" I do profess to some knowledge of this case,
</p>
<p>Mr. Inspector," returned Mr. Lamm, " and that is
</p>
<p>the reason why I made that suggestion just now
</p>
<p>about Mr. Fetridge here."
</p>
<p>" Oh, we understand that this is a complicated
</p>
<p>affair," remarked Inspector Applebee. " We know
</p>
<p>very well that Richard Fetridge is not the only
</p>
<p>person in the case. It's not professional, perhaps,
</p>
<p>to tell you, Mr. Lamm, but it is a fact that head-
</p>
<p>quarters have a man at Swampscott now, and
</p>
<p>another important arrest has already taken place.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fetridge, are you ready ? "
</p>
<p>" Another arrest ! " he gasped. " In the name
</p>
<p>of Heaven, who is it ? Who ? Not that unfortu-
</p>
<p>nate sufferer at the North villa ? "
</p>
<p>The inspector replied to this wild, impetuous

</p>
<p>WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm had stepped aside, and Inspector
</p>
<p>Applebee had already hooked his arm firmly in Mr.
</p>
<p>Fetridge's when a great noise at the door attracted
</p>
<p>their attention.
</p>
<p>Angry remonstrance and determined assertion
</p>
<p>were contending for the upper hand, when Mr.
</p>
<p>Lamm recognized, or thought he recognized, one
</p>
<p>of the voices.
</p>
<p>" I must go in ! I must, I say ! "
</p>
<p>It was Kingman F. Thomas who spoke the words,
</p>
<p>and there was no doubt about it. Dismissing all
</p>
<p>formality, Mr. Lamm hastened to the support of
</p>
<p>his ally, tried and true.
</p>
<p>Inspector Applebee, still attached to Richard
</p>
<p>Fetridge in this peculiarly " professional " manner,
</p>
<p>had not made up his mind whether or not to rebuke
</p>
<p>Mr. Lamm for his precipitate action, when Kingman
</p>
<p>F. Thomas entered the room and joined the trio.
</p>
<p>Breathless from his verbal and physical contest
</p>
<p>with the guardian of the portal himself panting
</p>
<p>and angry enough Thomas could not speak for a
</p>
<p>moment.
</p>
<p>"Well, Thomas," said the inspector testily,
</p>
<p>" what is the matter with you ? "
</p>
<p>" Something will be the matter with you in a
</p>
<p>minute when I tell you what I know," gasped the
</p>
<p>reporter.
</p>
<p>His manner was so unusual and excited that
</p>
<p>everybody began to have lively misapprehensions.
</p>
<p>" What do you mean ? " asked the inspector

</p>
<p>"NAME THE MAN." 3*9
</p>
<p>" Most assuredly I do," cried Thomas. " I am
</p>
<p>in possession of all the facts. Lock the doors,
</p>
<p>gentlemen. Everything must stay just as it is till
</p>
<p>I have told my story."
</p>
<p>" There is no time for stories," said Applebee.
</p>
<p>" If you are in possession of all the facts, you know
</p>
<p>who committed the murder. Tell us in a word.
</p>
<p>Who was it ? Name the man."
</p>
<p>There was a profound silence in the room as

<p>Kingman F. Thomas, at last himself again, opened

<p>CHAPTER XXV.
</p>
<p>NOT WHAT THEY EXPECTED, BUT STILL
</p>
<p>" INSPECTOR," returned Thomas, in a voice
</p>
<p>1 that trembled in spite of his efforts to the
</p>
<p>contrary, " I give you the solemn word of a man
</p>
<p>who at least believes that he speaks the truth.
</p>
<p>There has been no murder ! "
</p>
<p>But for the excited breathing of the living in the
</p>
<p>office of John Lamm, detective, there was no more
</p>
<p>sound in the moment following this utterance than
</p>
<p>there would have been if Thomas's auditors had
</p>
<p>suddenly become so many ingenious and lifelike
</p>
<p>pieces of waxwork.
</p>
<p>The inspector was the first to recover sufficient
</p>
<p>command of himself to trust his voice.
</p>
<p>" Do you mean to have us believe that it was a
</p>
<p>suicide ? " he demanded, with a scornful incredu-
</p>
<p>lity.
</p>
<p>" I do not," Thomas returned decisively. " I
</p>
<p>mean to have you believe that Paul North died
</p>
<p>from accident, pure and simple, without the inter-
</p>
<p>vention of any second person in any possible way."
</p>
<p>" And is this man," said the still incredulous in-
</p>
<p>spector, with a toss of his head in Fetridge's direc-
</p>
<p>tion, " supposed to have knowledge of this fact?"

<p>NOT WHAT THEY EXPECTED. 321
</p>
<p>" Me ! " gasped Richard Fetridge. " I assure
</p>
<p>you, sir, that I haven't the faintest idea of what he
</p>
<p>is talking about."
</p>
<p>"Umha! And the conspiracy?" murmured a
</p>
<p>reproachful voice close to the reporter's ear.
</p>
<p>Thomas turned quickly to grasp Lamm's hand.
</p>
<p>" My friend," he said solemnly, " I am sorry to
</p>
<p>say that you were quite right. There was a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. You were shrewdly speculating here one
</p>
<p>day as to which person was at the head of it and
</p>
<p>which person carried it out ; but you fell wide of
</p>
<p>the truth there. Lamm, Paul North himself was
</p>
<p>at the head of that conspiracy, and that pitiable
</p>
<p>woman, his adopted daughter, was the misguided
</p>
<p>instrument of perpetuating his vengeance."
</p>
<p>Among those who stared at Thomas there was
</p>
<p>certainly none whose face expressed more of be-
</p>
<p>wilderment, dumb and hopeless, than Richard
</p>
<p>Fetridge.
</p>
<p>Thomas observed this, but the sight seemed to
</p>
<p>kindle his indignation.
</p>
<p>" And as for the cause of the whole thing," he
</p>
<p>said, " it is easily to be found in the man who
</p>
<p>entered into an intrigue with an adventuress for
</p>
<p>purposes of his own to completely ruin the husband
</p>
<p>of Paul North's daughter."
</p>
<p>" For the cause of truth and justice," interposed
</p>
<p>Fetridge in a faint voice. " For the family honor
</p>
<p>and and my own."

<p>Thomas turned from him with a contemptuous

<p>shrug of the shoulders. And yet was he wholly
</p>
<p>322 WRITTEN IN RED,
</p>
<p>just in condemning this man, whose chief fault had
</p>
<p>been that he loved Marion North-Stackhouse too
</p>
<p>well to give her up so long as a chance remained of
</p>
<p>winning her ? With what feverish eagerness Rich-
</p>
<p>ard Fetridge must have seized upon the straw of
</p>
<p>hope which the revengeful Creole had brought into
</p>
<p>his office that fateful morning in May ; and how he
</p>
<p>must have argued with his own conscience till he
</p>
<p>had justified his course to himself ! But, then,
</p>
<p>allowance must be made for the frame of mind of
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas, who was grievously dissatisfied with
</p>
<p>the outcome of the North case.
</p>
<p>" And Thornton Stackhouse ? " he asked. " To
</p>
<p>speak more plainly, perhaps, Albert Runyon. I
</p>
<p>was told that he was here."
</p>
<p>" Thornton Stackhouse is dead," returned the
</p>
<p>inspector, impatiently. "He committed suicide this
</p>
<p>morning. We are wasting precious time, Mr.
</p>
<p>Thomas. If what you say is true, it is eminently
</p>
<p>important that I should be assured of it at once.
</p>
<p>Tell your story in the fewest possible words. In
</p>
<p>the first place, how did you become possessed of
</p>
<p>this information ? "
</p>
<p>" Dead ! " murmured the reporter. He looked
</p>
<p>about him sharply and the truth seemed to come to
</p>
<p>to him. He pointed toward the inner room. " In
</p>
<p>there ? "
</p>
<p>Lamm nodded.
</p>
<p>" What a coincidence ! "
</p>
<p>Everybody noticed that the reporter's lips had
</p>
<p>turned white. For a short time he seemed vainly

</p>
<p>The inspector, unaware of the cause of his agita-
</p>
<p>tion, again reminded him impatiently of the flight
</p>
<p>of time. Thomas drew himself together with an
</p>
<p>effort.
</p>
<p>" Permit me to sit down," he said ; and dropped
</p>
<p>at once into the nearest chair. He began to search
</p>
<p>in an inner pocket, and drew therefrom a folded
</p>
<p>document.
</p>
<p>" All necessary information is contained here,"
</p>
<p>he said, his voice gaining strength. " I have ob-
</p>
<p>tained it. It is my property, and I stipulate but
</p>
<p>one thing, inspector I am to dictate just how
</p>
<p>much of it is to be given to the press. Just
</p>
<p>enough of it may be presented to satisfy the public.
</p>
<p>No more. There is scandal enough in this affair
</p>
<p>at the best, without heaping the whole truth upon
</p>
<p>the heads of the unfortunate family."
</p>
<p>" You know yourself whether your request is
</p>
<p>reasonable," returned Applebee. " If it is, you
</p>
<p>know very well that I shall only be too glad to com-
</p>
<p>ply with it, if I can do so without placing my de-
</p>
<p>partment in a false light before the public."
</p>
<p>"This," continued Thomas, unfolding the docu-
</p>
<p>ment, " is the sworn statement of Marion North."
</p>
<p>" You mean Mrs. Stackhouse ? " the inspector
</p>
<p>said.
</p>
<p>" I mean Marion North, sir. As to how I ob-

<p>found in a letter written by her to him. I found

<p>her in the last agonies of a determined conflict be-

<p>tween her pride and a sense of justice, which I am
</p>
<p>sure would eventually have ended in the surrender

<p>of pride, even without my intervention. At first
</p>
<p>she fought me off with all her strength, but I was

<p>fortunately possessed of a stronger argument than
</p>
<p>anybody else could have brought to bear upon her
</p>
<p>in the person of her sister."

<p>" I," returned the reporter. " Exactly, my friend.
</p>
<p>The lady is a particular friend of my mother, and

<p>has been stopping with her for the week past. I

</p>
<p>" About noon of the i6th of June last, I received
</p>
<p>an anonymous letter, which has since been stolen
</p>
<p>from my writing-desk, warning me that an affair of
</p>
<p>great importance to my happiness was to be dis-
</p>
<p>cussed at my father's house in Marlboro Street that
</p>
<p>evening, and advising me, if I valued my future

<p>happiness, to be secretly present and overhear the
</p>
<p>conversation.

</p>
<p>thing was not right about the affairs of my father

<p>and the man whom I considered my husband ; and
</p>
<p>NOT WHAT THEY EXPECTED. 3 2 5
</p>
<p>I could see no harm to result from this means of
</p>
<p>obtaining information. I entrusted nobody with
</p>
<p>the contents of that letter, but, resolved to accept
</p>
<p>the advice therein contained, I took my keys to the
</p>
<p>house in Marlboro Street, and late in the afternoon
</p>
<p>of Thursday went to Boston.
</p>
<p>" I reached the house before seven o'clock, and
</p>
<p>let myself in by the front door. A little more than
</p>
<p>half an hour later I heard the noise of the latch
</p>
<p>key. I was then on the stairs, near the floor above,
</p>
<p>and when the door opened I very plainly heard the
</p>
<p>voices of my father and Mr. Richard Fetridge.
</p>
<p>*' ' I am very sure,' said my father, ' that Thorn-
</p>
<p>ton is here. Or else he has been here and forgotten
</p>
<p>to lock the storm door when he went out.'
</p>
<p>" ' We must know before we begin business,' re-
</p>
<p>turned Mr. Fetridge. ' I agreed to this place, you
</p>
<p>know, because there seemed to be absolutely no
</p>
<p>danger of our being overheard or interrupted. And
</p>
<p>Stackhouse is the very man of all others whom I
</p>
<p>wished to avoid. Is there no possibility that he has
</p>
<p>been warned of this conference ?'
</p>
<p>" ' None,' returned my father. ' I give you my
</p>
<p>word of honor, Mr. Fetridge, that I have not men-
</p>
<p>tioned a syllable of this affair to a living soul.'
</p>
<p>" And then I heard them coming upstairs. I
</p>
<p>understood from what they said that they intended
</p>
<p>to search the house. I ran up as lightly as I could
</p>
<p>and locked myself into a clothes-press in my own
</p>
<p>room. They afterward came to the door of my
</p>
<p>room, but evidently had already concluded that
</p>
<p>there was no intruder in the house.
</p>
<p>" When I was sure that they had gone clown
</p>
<p>again, I stole from the room, and took up a posi-

<p>tion on the stairs between the second and third
</p>
<p>floors. I did not dare to go any nearer, but as
</p>
<p>they were in the library, the door of which was
</p>
<p>open, I could hear plainly everything that was said.
</p>
<p>326 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>" I soon distinguished a woman's voice, and real-
</p>
<p>ized that she had been admitted to this mysterious
</p>
<p>' conference ' between Richard Fetridge and my
</p>
<p>father. This was the woman, I did not doubt, who
</p>
<p>had sent me the anonymous letter, for I did not
</p>
<p>see how anybody else could be aware of the
</p>
<p>appointment at this house."
</p>
<p>Richard Fetridge interrupted the reading at this
</p>
<p>point by breaking a paper ruler which he had been
</p>
<p>convulsively twisting in his hands as if he fancied
</p>
<p>his fingers were about the throat of the treacher-
</p>
<p>ous Marie.
</p>
<p>" Curse the woman ! " he cried. " Curse her !
</p>
<p>curse her ! She sacrificed me to gratify her own
</p>
<p>cunning instinct of revenge. She betrayed my con-
</p>
<p>fidence. She was not satisfied with what I prom-
</p>
<p>ised her. If I had known that night that she had
</p>
<p>dared to do it ! "
</p>
<p>" Humph ! " said Thomas. " If a man enters into
</p>
<p>an alliance with such a woman, what can he expect ? "
</p>
<p>Fetridge buried his face in his hands and did not
</p>
<p>reply. The reading continued :
</p>
<p>" I soon learned who she was and why she was
</p>
<p>here, and what Richard Fetridge had to say that
</p>
<p>he was afraid Thornton Stackhouse might overhear.
</p>
<p>The woman's name was stated as Marie Moissot,
</p>
<p>though it was admitted that she was now living
</p>
<p>under an alias. It appeared from the conversation
</p>
<p>that she had accidentally discovered the identity
</p>
<p>of Thornton Stackhouse with the Albert Runyon
</p>
<p>for whom she had long been searching, some weeks
</p>
<p>before, and had only been prevented from creating
</p>
<p>a scandal by the intervention of Richard Fetridge,

</p>
<p>ruin him, if she would consent to forego the malic-
</p>
<p>ious pleasure of involving the family in the disgrace
</p>
<p>of a public scandal.
</p>
<p>" In this paper, which I design to be a simple
</p>
<p>statement of facts, I do not wish to parade my own
</p>
<p>sufferings or emotions. But it is necessary to say
</p>
<p>that I had never loved my husband ; that I had
</p>
<p>married only because I became engaged to him in
</p>
<p>a moment of foolish pique, and my pride was too
</p>
<p>great to admit of my breaking that engagement.
</p>
<p>This imperious passion, which had already wrecked
</p>
<p>my happiness, was the hateful thing that was
</p>
<p>wounded, outraged, stung to fury by the revela-
</p>
<p>tions which I now overheard. I saw that Marie
</p>
<p>Moissot, with the natural suspicions of an unscrup-
</p>
<p>ulous person, mistrusted Mr. Fetridge's intention,
</p>
<p>perhaps his ability, to hasten the complete down-
</p>
<p>fall of Thornton Stackhouse, and had, therefore,
</p>
<p>written to me. It is only of late that I have thor-
</p>
<p>oughly realized how maliciously shrewd she was in
</p>
<p>assuring herself that I should become acquainted
</p>
<p>with the facts.
</p>
<p>" And these are the revelations that made my
</p>
<p>ears tingle, my heart beat like a trip-hammer, and
</p>
<p>my finger-nails to indent themselves into the palms
</p>
<p>of my hands ; that filled me for the time with the
</p>
<p>instincts of the murderess, and made my blood
</p>
<p>boil with indignant hatred. Thornton Stackhouse
</p>
<p>was the assumed name of an adventurer, Albert
</p>
<p>Runyon, whose legal wife and children were still
</p>
<p>living in New Orleans, who had deserted them to
</p>
<p>go with Marie Moissot, a fascinating Creole, at
</p>
<p>that time but sixteen years old, to Montreal, only
</p>
<p>to desert her in turn, and to come at last to ME !

</p>
<p>" This was the man for whom I had wrecked my
</p>
<p>life, broken two hearts, and sealed the warrant of
</p>
<p>my everlasting degradation !
</p>
<p>" There is no room for denial ; no chance for
</p>
<p>328 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>doubts. Everything that was presented to my
</p>
<p>father was in the form of documents, written evi-
</p>
<p>dence, sworn to and duly witnessed. Richard
</p>
<p>Fetrid'ge is a lawyer, and he had spent a month in
</p>
<p>verifying Marie Moissot's story.
</p>
<p>" Neither was there any room to doubt that
</p>
<p>Albert Runyon in marrying me understood fully to
</p>
<p>what position he was reducing me ; for the evidence
</p>
<p>showed that he continued even to this date to send
</p>
<p>his wife a monthly allowance for her support.
</p>
<p>" And the monster's excuse for all this villainy
</p>
<p>was that he did not love his wife, but loved me !
</p>
<p>As if a man who loved a woman could so cruelly,
</p>
<p>heartlessly deceive her !
</p>
<p>" But this is not all. Thornton Stackhouse had
</p>
<p>not been honest in his dealings with my father.
</p>
<p>The documents revealed a course of systematic
</p>
<p>treachery which if carried out would have ruined
</p>
<p>my father and enriched him. To be sure, all these
</p>
<p>transactions were of older date, and since his mock
</p>
<p>marriage with me there was no evidence that he
</p>
<p>had continued them. In other words, he had
</p>
<p>kindly consented to cease cheating Mr. North in
</p>
<p>consideration of having married his daughter,
</p>
<p>these circumstances palliate his offense any in my
</p>
<p>eyes? As well ask a drowning person if he is
</p>
<p>mindful of the subtraction or addition of a drop
</p>
<p>or two of the element that is killing him.
</p>
<p>" There have been times in my life when I have
</p>
<p>been frightened at the intensity of some sudden
</p>
<p>evil passion within me something that is so con-
</p>
<p>trary to my teaching and education, and arises so
</p>
<p>spontaneously that I have been led to regard such
</p>
<p>things as an inheritance from my unknown parents.

</p>
<p>And"this night as I stood on the stairs listening, a
</p>
<p>passion of hatred took possession of me, which I
</p>
<p>can compare to nothing but a great sea of molten
</p>
<p>metal in a smelting furnace, white, hot and hissing
</p>
<p>NOT WHAT THEY EXPECTED. 3-9
</p>
<p>like a serpent if it comes in contact with any cooler
</p>
<p>surface.
</p>
<p>" My father was scarcely less overcome than I
</p>
<p>was. He was violent and wretched by turns. Mr.
</p>
<p>Stackhouse had been a peculiar element in his life.
</p>
<p>The man had had an influence over him such as no
</p>
<p>one else had ever gained. Now, for the first time
</p>
<p>he was shown the real character of the man he had
</p>
<p>trusted.
</p>
<p>" Even through all the turbulence of my own
</p>
<p>emotions I understood the intensity of my father's
</p>
<p>feelings. He was a man of impulsive and quick
</p>
<p>temper. He never preserved a hatred ; but for
</p>
<p>that very reason it lived all the fiercer at the moment
</p>
<p>of its birth. His own rage at this instant was little
</p>
<p>short of mine.
</p>
<p>" ' Villain ! Scoundrel ! Harpy ! ' I heard him
</p>
<p>mutter from time to time, and then he would burst
</p>
<p>out into violent imprecations that would have terri-
</p>
<p>.fied me had I been in a mood to fear anything.
</p>
<p>" When he had submitted his evidence, Mr. Fet-
</p>
<p>ridge suggested the action which he asked my
</p>
<p>father to take. He said that he had done all that
</p>
<p>he had done for the family honor and for my honor.
</p>
<p>That if it had not been for his opportune interven-
</p>
<p>tion Marie Moissot would have made the bigamy
</p>
<p>of Albert Runyon a public scandal. He reminded
</p>
<p>my father that I was no more the wife of this
</p>
<p>scoundrel than as if that sacrilege of a ceremony
</p>
<p>had never been performed. There were, therefore,
</p>
<p>no legal ties to be severed. Mr. North must act
</p>
<p>in the matter as if he had become possessed of his
</p>
<p>information through any source but the real one.
</p>
<p>Richard Fetridge's part in the affair was never to

</p>
<p>be known ; not even to me. But I was to learn the
</p>
<p>truth from my father's lips. So was Albert Runyon.
</p>
<p>My father was to go to him ; give him twenty-four
</p>
<p>hours to leave the country after signing a damaging
</p>
<p>33 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>document which Mr. Fetridge had prepared. In
</p>
<p>course of time it was suggested that I might quietly
</p>
<p>obtain a divorce on the ground of desertion. In
</p>
<p>case this programme was carried out, Mr. Fetridge
</p>
<p>proposed to help my father out of his financial
</p>
<p>difficulties. Otherwise he could withdraw his sup-
</p>
<p>port.
</p>
<p>" When the arrangements had been completed,
</p>
<p>Mr. Fetridge went away with the woman, and my
</p>
<p>father, who proposed to sleep in the house that
</p>
<p>night and to meet Mr. Fetridge early in the morn-
</p>
<p>ing, after seeing them to the door, returned to his
</p>
<p>library.
</p>
<p>" I awoke gradually out of my long trance, and
</p>
<p>went down to the library door. I did not propose
</p>
<p>to conceal the fact of my presence from my father.
</p>
<p>The conference between us was not to be delayed.
</p>
<p>It must take place to-night.
</p>
<p>" He was so engrossed that he did not hear my
</p>
<p>footsteps. I was startled when I saw what his
</p>
<p>occupation was. He was loading his pistol. I was
</p>
<p>not in a condition to measure accurately the flight
</p>
<p>of time, but I must have lingered on the staircase
</p>
<p>some minutes after his return to the library, for, as
</p>
<p>I afterwards discovered, he had quite finished his
</p>
<p>task when I interrupted him. He had taken out
</p>
<p>his box of cartridges from a drawer of his writing-
</p>
<p>desk, which still stood open.
</p>
<p>" ' Father ! ' I called to him. ' Father ! '
</p>
<p>" He uttered an exclamation of horror, repulsed
</p>
<p>the pistol, as if endeavoring to conceal it, and
</p>
<p>turned toward me. He whispered my name, and
</p>
<p>took a step or two hastily toward me.
</p>
<p>" At the same time I uttered a cry of warning,
</p>

</p>
<p>for I saw the pistol topple over by its own weight.
</p>
<p>Slowly at first and then with a quick dash, it slid
</p>
<p>from a mass of papers upon which it had been
</p>
<p>placed, dropped from the edge, turned completely
</p>
<p>NOT WHAT THEY EXPECTED. 33 l
</p>
<p>over, and was caught in the corner of the open
</p>
<p>drawer. My cry was drowned by the simultaneous
</p>
<p>report. Mr. North threw up his hands, rushed
</p>
<p>forward with an awful look in his face, and fell at
</p>
<p>my feet.
</p>
<p>" I vaguely remember hearing him speak my
</p>
<p>name and murmur something about my husband.
</p>
<p>But this sudden, unexpected climax to the unutter-
</p>
<p>able horrors of that night gave me a temporary
</p>
<p>relief to my suffering. I could bear no more. I
</p>
<p>have a dim remembrance of putting out my hands
</p>
<p>to save myself from falling.
</p>
<p>" I have no means of knowing how long I lay
</p>
<p>upon the floor. When I awoke I saw my father
</p>
<p>lying motionless by the door, with that horrible
</p>
<p>dripping scrawl which I knew had been made by
</p>
<p>his own blood upon the wall. I called to him, I
</p>
<p>seized his hand, but I soon saw that he was quite
</p>
<p>dead.
</p>
<p>" The sight of the blood did not terrify me. I
</p>
<p>am ashamed to confess it, and I cannot explain it,
</p>
<p>but it filled me temporarily with a strange, wild,
</p>
<p>savage exultation. I know now that I must have
</p>
<p>been crazy. Emotional insanity, the physicians call
</p>
<p>it. God knows how I honored and loved the man
</p>
<p>who had been a father to me. I am told they sus-
</p>
<p>pected me of having killed him. Heaven knows I
</p>
<p>am wicked enough ; but not that crime no, not
</p>
<p>that !
</p>
<p>" Let me pass over the next fifteen minutes. They
</p>
<p>will be a terror to me as long as memory remains
</p>
<p>to me. When I became calmer, I tried to realize
</p>
<p>what had been done. I had no doubt that my
</p>
<p>father had intended to write a message to me to

</p>
<p>tell me no doubt that this man was not my husband.
</p>
<p>In his dying moments his unfulfilled purpose had
</p>
<p>haunted him.
</p>
<p>" I cannot tell the stifling sensations which fol-
</p>
<p>33 2 WRITTEN IN RED.
</p>
<p>lowed the sudden realization that this writing on
</p>
<p>the wall would be taken as an accusation against
</p>
<p>the man who had done his best to ruin us both.
</p>
<p>" When this awful idea first came to me, I fled
</p>
<p>from the room, as if by so doing I could leave the
</p>
<p>idea behind me. I actually had opened the outer
</p>
<p>door to call help when the full realization of all that
</p>
<p>my false husband had done to me rushed over me
</p>
<p>with renewed force. I stopped still and my heart
</p>
<p>was steeled to every cry of conscience. As fully
</p>
<p>possessed of my faculties as I ever was in my life,
</p>
<p>I stood at the door and thought of everything of
</p>
<p>the chances of the success of this terrible revenge
</p>
<p>for my wrongs ; of my ability to carry out the plan ;
</p>
<p>of the fact even that once embarked in it there could
</p>
<p>be no drawing back ; that I could never survive
</p>
<p>the disgrace of discovery. ' Revenge,' I say, now ;
</p>
<p>but that night the word in my mind was ' justice.'
</p>
<p>Would this act of mine immolate Albert Runyon in
</p>
<p>a greater degree than he had sacrificed me ? No
</p>
<p>and this to my mind that night was ' justice ! '
</p>
<p>" This reflection sealed my fate. I went back
</p>
<p>resolutely. I assured myself that my father was
</p>
<p>dead beyond all recall. I replaced the cartridges
</p>
<p>in the drawer whence he had taken them. The
</p>
<p>fatal pistol still lay upside down firmly wedged in
</p>
<p>its place, with its barrel laid across the corner point-
</p>
<p>ing outward at an upward angle. The hammer had
</p>
<p>caught upon the ornamental scroll work just above
</p>
<p>the drawer as it fell. To such a point were my
</p>
<p>faculties sharpened by the danger and the boldness
</p>
<p>of my designs that I noted every detail of these
</p>
<p>facts. I knew that this pistol was the only testi-
</p>
<p>mony to the real facts of my father's death.

<p>folded the document "all that is written here. I
</p>
<p>hardly need say that I do not subscribe to the lady's
</p>
<p>idea of her father's purpose in writing his partner's
</p>
<p>name on the wall. She takes a view lenient as pos-
</p>
<p>sible to him. But to my mind that he carried a full
</p>
<p>intention of revenging himself upon his recreant
</p>
<p>partner from the moment he set out to load that
</p>
<p>pistol with the intention of shooting him, to the mo-
</p>
<p>ment of his death, is the only logical construction
</p>
<p>to be placed upon his conduct. And I unhesi-
</p>
<p>tatingly put North at the head of the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>His daughter unfortunate woman! let his pur-
</p>
<p>pose be carried out by concealing the evidences of
</p>
<p>the accident. In the sequel we see the mockery of
</p>
<p>fate; for in the end it is not Stackhouse, but Rich-
</p>
<p>ard Fetridge, who is arrested for the crime."
</p>
<p>And, indeed, Thomas's view of the case was the
</p>
<p>theory which came eventually to be accepted by all

</p>
<p>quite possible to determine beyond a doubt the in-
</p>
<p>tent of Paul North in writing upon the wall, still
</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas's conclusion, that a deadly purpose of
</p>
<p>revenge filled the mind of the dying man, must be,
</p>
<p>in lieu of something better, accepted as final.
</p>
<p>The profound silence which immediately fol-
</p>
<p>lowed the reporter's words was broken by Fetridge,
</p>
<p>who had been sitting with his hand shading his eyes
</p>
<p>during the latter portion of the reading.
</p>
<p>"And to think," he murmured, "that it was for
</p>
<p>this end I have been trying to keep this scandal
</p>
<p>from the public ear! Why, it will be worse, a
</p>
<p>thousand times worse," he exclaimed, starting up,
</p>
<p>"than if I had precipitated the facts as I knew
</p>
<p>them. Then it might have been hushed up. Now
</p>
<p>that is impossible."
</p>
<p>"If you had but had a little confidence in me!"
</p>
<p>said John Lamm reproachfully. "Well, Inspector,
</p>
<p>what's to be done?"
</p>
<p>He asked the question a little maliciously.
</p>
<p>"How do we know that this statement is true?"
</p>
<p>exclaimed Applebee, who was but just recovering
</p>
<p>from his breathless amazement. "Fortunately this
</p>
<p>woman is already under arrest, and "
</p>
<p>' 'Ah, pardon me," interrupted Thomas, solemnly.
</p>
<p>"She is not, inspector."
</p>
<p>"Not arrested ! " exclaimed the astonished official.
</p>
<p>"You do not know that woman, " said the repor-
</p>
<p>ter with a sigh, "or you would have guessed the
</p>
<p>truth already. Marion North could not survive

</p>
<p>such a disclosure."
</p>
<p>NOT WHAT THEY EXPECTED. 335
</p>
<p>' ' She is dead ! ' ' cried Fetridge, with bloodless lips.
</p>
<p>"She is dead," repeated the reporter. "Soon
</p>
<p>after the witnessing of this document she com-
</p>
<p>plained of feeling weak, and expressed a desire to
</p>
<p>lie down. A little later her sister came to me,
</p>
<p>greatly alarmed. Marion was breathing strangely,
</p>
<p>she said, and her face had changed color. I sus-
</p>
<p>pected the truth and hastened after a -physician.
</p>
<p>When he commenced his examination he found this
</p>
<p>little bit of paper in her bosom:
</p>
<p>" 'For God's sake, conceal my disgrace! I have
</p>
<p>poisoned myself.' '
</p>
<p>Richard Fetridge uttered a groan, sank into his
</p>
<p>chair, and buried his face in his hands.
</p>
<p>"The physician privately informed the officers
</p>
<p>who came to arrest her," continued the reporter,
</p>
<p>"that she had been summoned before a higher
</p>
<p>tribunal."
</p>
<p>And Richard Fetridge could only murmur
</p>
<p>"Heaven pity her and me! God have mercy on
</p>
<p>us both."
</p>
<p>And so the great case came to an end. Thomas
</p>
<p>succeeded in keeping all but the most meager details
</p>
<p>from the curious gaze of the public. It was not in
</p>
<p>his province to suppress news, but, as John Lamm
</p>
<p>said
</p>
<p>"A man will do a great deal for the sake of the
</p>
<p>woman he thinks enough of to marry."
