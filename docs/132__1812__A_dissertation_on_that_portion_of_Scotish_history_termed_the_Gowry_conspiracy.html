<p>DISSERTATION
</p>
<p>ON
</p>
<p>THAT PORTION OF SCOTTISH HISTORY
</p>
<p>TERMED
</p>
<p>THE GOWRY CONSPIRACY*
</p>
<p>OF the many dark transactions, recorded in Scotish
</p>
<p>History, few have been the subject of greater controversy,
</p>
<p>than that which took place in the end of the 16th Century,
</p>
<p>known by the name of Gowry's Conspiracy. No one is
</p>
<p>more deserving of investigation.
</p>
<p>In these rude and turbulent times, rapine and assassi*
</p>
<p>nation were far from being rare. But a young man, of a-
</p>
<p>miable manners, and a conciliating disposition, the chief of
</p>
<p>an ancient, potent, and opulent family, and the favourite of
</p>
<p>his fellow citizens, slain, in his own house, by his guests ;
</p>
<p>and these guests his sovereign and courtiers ; his next bro-
</p>
<p>ther put to death at the same time with himself; the rest of
</p>
<p>his friends proscribed ; such of his servants as evidenced any
</p>
<p>kind of fidelity towards him, hanged as traitors ; his own
</p>
<p>dead body treated with every kind of ignominy ; his name
</p>
<p>and race annihilated : and his property confiscated ; are no
</p>
<p>common occurrences. Yet, in the opinion of most people,
</p>
<p>this was the fate of John Earl of Gowry. One thing is cer-
</p>
<p>tain, whoever was the conspirator, the consequences to the
</p>
<p>Ruthven Family were such as must affect every contempla-
</p>
<p>tive mind. If the two brothers really made an attempt on
</p>
<p>the king, we may well say " grievous has the expiation
</p>
<p>been." But if the whole was no more than a contrivance
</p>
<p>of James ; words are insufficient to express his villany.
</p>
<p>The account of this affair, published by authority, gave
</p>
<p>satisfaction to only very few, at the time, and ever since,

</p>
<p>A
</p>
<p>there have not been wanting, persons who declared them-
</p>
<p>selves equally sceptical.
</p>
<p>For a long time, the public seemed to be divided into
</p>
<p>only two opinions relative to this matter, viz. those who
</p>
<p>were persuaded, or pretended to be so, that Gowry invited
</p>
<p>the king to his house, with the design of assassinating him,
</p>
<p>because of his cruelty to Earl William, father to John, his
</p>
<p>attachment to worthless favourites, and his encroachments
</p>
<p>on the liberties of the subject : and those who supposed it a
</p>
<p>plot of James, and some of his minions ; the one to get rid
</p>
<p>of the Earl, whom he hated and envied, the others to take
</p>
<p>that person out of the way, who was most likely to with-
</p>
<p>stand their corrupt and oppressive practices, and to obtain
</p>
<p>a division of his extensive domains amongst them. But of
</p>
<p>late, it has become customary, for Scotish Historians to re-
</p>
<p>present sOme of the most important occurrences, in a light
</p>
<p>quite new, and altogether different from that in which we
</p>
<p>have been accustomed to view them. Perhaps each suc-
</p>
<p>ceeding writer considers something of this kind as necessary
</p>
<p>to render his work interesting, well reflecting, that, as many
</p>
<p>relations of the Affairs of Scotland are already before the
</p>
<p>Public, its attention can only be attracted to any recent
</p>
<p>narrative, by novelty. And certainly, when supported by
</p>
<p>authentic documents, the developement of mystery, or cor-
</p>
<p>rection of misrepresentation, is a far more valuable trait in
</p>
<p>the historical character, than a repetition of former ac-
</p>
<p>counts, though in more polished language. Perhaps too,
</p>
<p>in the number of historians who have ventured to differ in
</p>
<p>particular points from their predecessors, there have been
</p>
<p>some, whose situation rendered it inconvenient for them,
</p>
<p>to expose to the public eye, the secret springs of the ac-
</p>
<p>tions of statesmen, even after a lapse of two hundred years.
</p>
<p>Whatever his reason was, Dr Principal Robertson gave
</p>
<p>it as his opinion, that the destruction of the Gowry Family
</p>
<p>was occasioned by an unsuccessful attempt of the two bro-

<p>thers, Earl John and the honourable Alexander Ruth-
</p>
<p>ven, not to murder but to seize the person of King James
</p>
<p>the Sixth* and deliver it up to Queen Elizabeth of England.
</p>
<p>This never proved a satisfactory solution of the mystery,
</p>
<p>(if a mystery there was,) and the public opinion seemed to
</p>
<p>revert to one or other of the original hypotheses, till, with-
</p>
<p>in these few years, that Mr Pinkerton, in an Appendix to
</p>
<p>the first volume of Laing's History, advances another, in
</p>
<p>which, the Earl is supposed entirely innocent and ignorant
</p>
<p>of every kind of conspiracy against his Sovereign: but that,
</p>
<p>his brother Alexander having criminal intercourse with
</p>
<p>James' Queen, Ann of Denmark, they (Alexander and
</p>
<p>Ann) formed the design of dethroning, if not of murdering
</p>
<p>His Majesty; that in endeavouring to accomplish this,
</p>
<p>by some unaccountable fatality, Alexander, on whom the
</p>
<p>executive part of the plot devolved, became insane, and so,
</p>
<p>being incapable of conducting the important enterprize, he
</p>
<p>lost his life in the attempt; and that the Earl was slain
</p>
<p>in mistake by the King's party, they supposing him engaged
</p>
<p>in the conspiracy, when he entered the apartment where
</p>
<p>Alexander made the attact, merely to learn the nature of
</p>
<p>the fray.
</p>
<p>That we may be enabled to form a competent judgment
</p>
<p>of these several theories, it will be proper,
</p>
<p>In the first place, to give the account published by au-
</p>
<p>thority of government, some weeks after the death of the
</p>
<p>two brothers, entitled, " A Discourse of the unnatural and
</p>
<p>vile conspiracy attempted by John, Earl of Gowry, and
</p>
<p>his brother, against His Majesty's person, at St Johnston,
</p>
<p>upon the 5th of August, 1.600 :"
</p>
<p>Secondly, briefly to state such circumstances relative to
</p>
<p>this affair, as are omitted in the " Discourse," or have taken
</p>
<p>place since it was published :
</p>
<p>Thirdly, to transcribe from the Public Records, the
</p>
<p>depositions of the Witnesses, and an account of the other
</p>
<p>proceedings at the Precognitions and Trial :
</p>
<p>Fourthly, to enquire, as far as we have in our power,
</p>
<p>into the characters of the Witnesses, Judges, Parties, and
</p>
<p>other Persons concerned in this Transaction, so as to as>-
</p>
<p>certain, as near as possible, what credibility is due to their
</p>
<p>evidence, or what their motives were, for intermeddling in
</p>
<p>the affair:
</p>
<p>And Lastly, by such inferences as may fairly be deduced

<p>from the whole, endeavour to discover which of the four
</p>
<p>theories that have been proposed, is the most probable.
</p>
<p>I mo. A Discourse of the unnatural and vile Conspiracy, %c t
</p>
<p>His Majestie having his residence at Falkland, and be-
</p>
<p>ing daily at the Buck-hunting (as his use is in jthat season)
</p>
<p>A2
</p>
<p>upon the fifth day of August, being Tuesday, hee raide out
</p>
<p>to the Park, between six and seven o'clock in the morning,
</p>
<p>the weather being wonderful pleasant and seasonable. But
</p>
<p>before His Majestie could leap on horse-back, His High-
</p>
<p>nesse being now come down by the equerie ; all the hunts-
</p>
<p>men with the hounds, attending His Majestie on the green,
</p>
<p>and the Court making to their horses, as His Highnesse
</p>
<p>self was, Master Alexander Ruthven, second brother to
</p>
<p>the late Earl of Gowrie, being then lighted in the town of
</p>
<p>Falkland, hasted him fast down to overtake His Majestie
</p>
<p>before his onleaping, as hee did. Where meeting His
</p>
<p>Highnesse, after a low courtesie, bowing his head under
</p>
<p>His Majestie's knee, (although hee was never wont to make
</p>
<p>so lowe a courtesie) drawing His Majestie aparte, hee be-
</p>
<p>gins to discourse with him, (but with a very dejected coun-
</p>
<p>tenance, his eies ever fixed upon the earth) how that it
</p>
<p>chanced him, in the evening before, to be walking abroad
</p>
<p>about the fields, taking the ayre solitairie alone, without
</p>
<p>the town of St Johnston, where his present dwelling with
</p>
<p>the Lordc his brother was, and there, by accident affirmed
</p>
<p>to have recountered a base-like fellow unknowne to him,
</p>
<p>with a cloke, cast about his mouth; whom, as hee enquired
</p>
<p>his name and what his errand was to be passing in so soli-
</p>
<p>tary a part, being from all waics ; the fellow become on a
</p>
<p>sodaine so amazed, and his tongue so faultered in his mouth,
</p>
<p>that, upon his suspicious behaviour, hee beganne more
</p>
<p>narrowly to look unto him, and examine him : and per-
</p>
<p>ceiving that there appeared something to be hid under his
</p>
<p>cloke, he did cast by the lappet of it, and so finds a great
</p>
<p>wide pot to be under his arme, all full of coined gold in
</p>
<p>great pieces, assuring His Majestie, that it was in very
</p>
<p>great quantity. Upon the sight whereof (as he affirmed)
</p>
<p>hee took back the fellow with his burthen to the towne,
</p>
<p>where hee, privately, without the knowledge of any man,
</p>
<p>took the fellow and bound him in a privy denied house ;

</p>
<p>and after locked many doors upon him, and had hasted
</p>
<p>him out of St Johnston, that day by four hours in the
</p>
<p>morning, to make His Majestie advertised thereof, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to his bound duty, earnestly requesting His Majestie,
</p>
<p>with all diligence and secresie, that His Majestie might
</p>
<p>take order therewith, before any knew thereof, swearing
</p>
<p>and protesting, that hee had yet concealed it from all men,
</p>
<p>yea? from the Earl bis, own (brother. His Majestie's first
</p>
<p>answer was, (after thanking him for his good will) that it
</p>
<p>could not become His Majestie, to meddle any waies in
</p>
<p>that matter, since no man's treasure that is a free and law-
</p>
<p>ful subject, can by the law, appertain unto the king, ex-
</p>
<p>cept it be found hid under the earth, as this was not ; where-
</p>
<p>unto he answered, That the fellow confessed unto him, that
</p>
<p>lie was going to have hid it under the ground, but could
</p>
<p>not take leasure at that time to enquire any further of him.
</p>
<p>Whereunto His Majestie replied, That there was great dif-
</p>
<p>ference betwixt a deed and the intention of a deed ; his in-
</p>
<p>tention to have hid it, not being alike as if it had been hid.
</p>
<p>Maistcr Alexander's answer was, That hee thought His
</p>
<p>Majestie over scrupulous in such a matter, tending so great-
</p>
<p>ly to His Majestie's profit ; and that, if his Majestie defer-
</p>
<p>red to meddle with it, that it might bee that the Lorde his
</p>
<p>brother, and other great men, might meddle with it, and
</p>
<p>make His Majestie the more adoe. Whereupon the king
</p>
<p>beginning to suspect, that it had been some forreigne gold
</p>
<p>brought home by some Jesuits or practising Papists, (there-
</p>
<p>with to stirr up some new sedition, as they have oftentimes
</p>
<p>done before,) inquired of the said Maister Alexander, what
</p>
<p>kind of coin it was ? and what a fellow he was that carried
</p>
<p>it? His answer was, That so farre as he could take leizure
</p>
<p>to see them, that they seemed to be forreigne strokes of
</p>
<p>coyne; and altho' the fellow, both by his language and
</p>
<p>fashions, seemed to be a Scots fellow, yet he could never
</p>
<p>remember that he had seen him before. These speeches
</p>
<p>increased His Majestie's suspicion, that it was foraine coyne
</p>
<p>brought in by some practising Papists, and to be distribut-
</p>
<p>ed into the countrie, as is said before, and that the fellow
</p>
<p>that carried it was some Scots Priest, or Seminarie, so dis-
</p>
<p>guised for the more sure transporting thereof.
</p>
<p>Whereupon His M ajestic resolved, that he would send
</p>
<p>back with the said Maister Alexander a servant of his own,
</p>
<p>with a warrant to the Provost and Bailiiffes of St Johns-

</p>
<p>ton, to receive both the fellow, and the money at Maister
</p>
<p>Alexander's hand, and after they had examined the fellow,
</p>
<p>to retain him and the treasure till His Majestie's further
</p>
<p>pleasure was knowne.
</p>
<p>Whereat the said Maister Alexander stirred marvellous-
</p>
<p>ly : affirming and protesting that if either the Lorde hi*
</p>
<p>brother, or the Bailliffes of the towne, were put on the
</p>
<p>counsail thereof, His IVJajestie would get a very badda
</p>
<p>6m
</p>
<p>count made to him of tliat treasure, swearing, that the
</p>
<p>great love and affection hee bare unto His Majestie, had
</p>
<p>made him to preferre His Majestie in this case, both unto
</p>
<p>himself and his brother : for the which service he humbly
</p>
<p>craved that recompense, that His Majestie would take the
</p>
<p>paynes once to ride thither, that he might be the first seer
</p>
<p>thereof himself; which being done, he would remit to His
</p>
<p>Majestie's owne honourable discretion, how far it would
</p>
<p>please His Majestie to consider upon him for that service.
</p>
<p>His Highness being stricken in great admiration, both
</p>
<p>of the uncou thnesse of the tale, and of the strange and stu-
</p>
<p>pide behaviour of the reporter ; and the Court being al-
</p>
<p>ready horsed, wondering at His Majestie's so long stay
</p>
<p>with the gentleman, the morning being so faire, the game
</p>
<p>already found, and the huntsmen staying so long on the
</p>
<p>fields for His Majestie; hee was forced to break off; only
</p>
<p>with these wordes, that hee could not stay any longer from
</p>
<p>his sport, but that hee would consider of the matter, and,
</p>
<p>at the end of his chace, give him a resolute answer, what
</p>
<p>order he would take therein ; whereupon His Majestie part-
</p>
<p>ed in haste from him towards the place where the game
</p>
<p>was.
</p>
<p>" Maister Alexander parting from His Majestie very mis-
</p>
<p>content, that indelayedly he raide not to Saint Johnstoun,
</p>
<p>as he desired him; protesting that His Majestie would
</p>
<p>not find every day such a choice of hunting as hee had of-
</p>
<p>fered to him ; and that hee feared that His Majestie's long
</p>
<p>delay, and slowness of resolution, would breed leizure to
</p>
<p>the fellow, who was laying bound, to cry, or make suck
</p>
<p>dinne as would disappoint the secrecie of the whole pur-
</p>
<p>pose, and make both the fellow and the treasure to be med-
</p>

<p>haste, hee might have prevented, arriving there in the time
</p>
<p>of his brother's, and the whole town's being at the sermon ;
</p>
<p>whereby His Majestie might have taken such secret order
</p>
<p>with that matter, as hee pleased, before their outcoming from
</p>
<p>the church. But His Majestie, without any further an-
</p>
<p>swering him, leapinge on horseback and riding to tfye dogs,
</p>
<p>where they were beginning to hunt, the said Mr Alexander
</p>
<p>stayed still in that place, where hee had left His Majestie,
</p>
<p>and having two men with him appointed by the Earl his
</p>
<p>brother, to carry backe unto him the certayiie news in ail
</p>
<p>haste of His Majestie's coining, (as hereafter more parti-
</p>
<p>cularly shall in this same discourse be declared.)
</p>
<p>He directed one of them, called Andrew Henderson,
</p>
<p>chamberlaine to the said Earl, to ride in all haste to the
</p>
<p>Earle, commanding him, as he loved his brother's honour,
</p>
<p>that he should not spare for spilling his horse, and that hee
</p>
<p>should advertise the Earle, that hee hoped to move His Ma-
</p>
<p>jestie to come thither, and that hee should not yet look for
</p>
<p>him for the space of three hours thereafter, because of His
</p>
<p>Majestie's hunting, adding these words, " Praye my Lorde,
</p>
<p>my brother to prepare dinner for us." But His Majestic
</p>
<p>was no sooner ridden up a little hill above the little woode,
</p>
<p>where the dogs were layde on in hunting, but that, not-
</p>
<p>withstanding the pleasant beginning of the chace, he could
</p>
<p>not stay from musing and wondering upon the news. Where-
</p>
<p>upon, without making any body acquainted with his pur-
</p>
<p>pose, finding John Nesmith, chirurgian, by chance riding
</p>
<p>beside him, His Majestie directed him back to bring Mais-
</p>
<p>ter Alexander with him; who being brought unto His
</p>
<p>Majestie, and having newly directed, as said is, one of his
</p>
<p>men that was with him backe to my Lorde his brother, His
</p>
<p>Majestie unknowing or suspecting that any man living had
</p>
<p>come witli him ; then told him that hee had been advising
</p>
<p>with himself, and in respect of his last words so earnest
</p>
<p>with him, he resolved to ride thither for that errand in his
</p>
<p>own person, how soon the chace was ended, which was al-
</p>
<p>ready begunne. Like as His Majestie upon the very end-
</p>
<p>ing of these wordes, did ride away in the chace, the said
</p>
<p>Maister Alexander did follow him at his backe; no other
</p>
<p>creature being with His Majestie, but hee, and John Ha-
</p>
<p>milton of Grange, one of His Majestie's master stablers, the
</p>
<p>rest of the court being all before in the chase, His Majestie
</p>
<p>only being cast back upon the staying to speake with Mais-
</p>
<p>ter Alexander, as is before sayde.

</p>
<p>The chase lasted from about seaven of the clock in the
</p>
<p>morning, untill eleven and more, being one of the greatest
</p>
<p>and sorest chases that ever His Majestie was at : all which
</p>
<p>time the said Maister Alexander was, for the most part,
</p>
<p>ever at His Majestie's backe, as is said. But there never
</p>
<p>was any stope in the chase, or so small a delay, that the
</p>
<p>said Maister Alexander ommitted to round His Majestie,
</p>
<p>earnestly requesting him to*hasten the end of the hunting,
</p>
<p>that hee might ride the sooner to St Johnstown, so as, at
</p>
<p>the death of the bucke, His Majestie not staying upon the
</p>
<p>curry of the diere, (as his use is) scarcelie took time to alight,
</p>
<p>awayting the coming of a fresh horse to ride on, the great-
</p>
<p>ness of the chase having wearied his horse.
</p>
<p>But the said Maister Alexander would not suffer the
</p>
<p>King to stay in the park where the bucke was killed, while
</p>
<p>his fresh horse which was already sent for, was brought
</p>
<p>out of the equerie to him, (altho' it was not two flight-
</p>
<p>shot off betwixt the parte where the bucke was killed, and
</p>
<p>His Majestie's equerie :) but with verie importunitie forced
</p>
<p>His Majestie to leape on again upon the same horse, that
</p>
<p>he had hunted all the day upon, his fresh horse being made
</p>
<p>to gallop a mile of the way to overtake him ; His Majestie
</p>
<p>not staying so much as upon his sword, nor while the Duke
</p>
<p>and the Earle of Mar with diverse other gentlemen, in his
</p>
<p>company had changed their horses: only saying unto them,
</p>
<p>that he was to ride to St Johnstoun to speak with the Earle
</p>
<p>of Gowrie, and that he would be presently back again be-
</p>
<p>fore even.
</p>
<p>Whereupon some of the court galloped back to Falk-
</p>
<p>land as fast as they could, to chaunge horse, but could not
</p>
<p>overtake His Majestie untill he came within a few miles of
</p>
<p>St Johnstoun. Others rid forward with their horses, wea-
</p>
<p>ried as they were, whereof some were compelled to alight
</p>
<p>by the way ; and had they not both refreshed their horses,
</p>
<p>fed them, and given them some grasse, by the way, they
</p>
<p>had not carried them to Saint Johnstoun i the cause of
</p>
<p>His Majestie's servants following so fast, undesired by him,
</p>
<p>being only grounded upon a suspition they had conceived,
</p>
<p>that His Majestie's intention of riding was for the appre-
</p>
<p>hension of the Maister of Oliphant, one who had lately
</p>
<p>done a vile and proud oppression in Angus ; for repairing
</p>
<p>of the which, they thought that His Majestie had some
</p>
<p>purpose for his apprehension.

</p>
<p>But the said Maister Alexander seeing the Duke and
</p>
<p>the Earle of Mar, with diverse of the court, getting fresh
</p>
<p>horse for following of His Majestie, earnestlie desired him
</p>
<p>that he would publish to his whole traine, that since he was
</p>
<p>to return the same evening, as is afore sayde, they needed
</p>
<p>net follow him, especiallie that hee thought it meetest His-
</p>
<p>Majestie should stay the Duke and the Earle of Mar to
</p>
<p>follow him, and that he should only take three or four of
</p>
<p>his own servants with him ; affirming that if any nobleman
</p>
<p>followed him, he could not answer for it; but that they
</p>
<p>would marre the whole purpose. Whereuppon His Majes-
</p>
<p>tie, half angry, replyed that hee would not mistrust the
</p>
<p>Duke nor the Earle of Mar in a greater purpose than that,
</p>
<p>and that hee could not understand what hindrance any
</p>
<p>man could make in that errand.
</p>
<p>But these last speeches of Maister Alexander made the
</p>
<p>King begin to suspect what it should meanne: whereuppon,
</p>
<p>many and sundrie thoughts beganne to enter into the
</p>
<p>King's mind: yet His Majestic could never suspect any
</p>
<p>harme to be intended against His Highnesse by the young
</p>
<p>gentleman, with whom His Majestie had been so well ac-
</p>
<p>quainted, as he had not long before been in suite to be one
</p>
<p>of the gentlemen of his chamber : so as, the farthest that
</p>
<p>his suspition could reach to, was, that it might be that the
</p>
<p>Earle his brother had handled him so hardly, that the
</p>
<p>young gentleman being of a hie spirit, had taken such
</p>
<p>displeasure, as he was become somewhat beside himselfj
</p>
<p>which His Majestie conjectured, as well by his raised and
</p>
<p>uncouth staring, and continual pensiveness all the time of
</p>
<p>the hunting, as likewise by such strange sort of unlikely
</p>
<p>discourses, as are already mentioned.
</p>
<p>Whereuppon the King took occasion to make the Duke
</p>
<p>of Lennox acquainted with the whole purpose, enquiring
</p>
<p>of him very earnestlie, what he knew of the young gentle-
</p>
<p>man's nature being his brother-in-law, and if he had per-
</p>
<p>ceived him to be subject to any high apprehensions ? His
</p>
<p>Majestie declaring his suspition plainlie to the said Lorde
</p>
<p>Duke, that he thought him not well settled in his witts ;
</p>
<p>alweis desiring my Lorde Duke not to fail to accompanie
</p>
<p>him into that house where the allegid fellow and treasure
</p>
<p>was.
</p>
<p>The Lorde Duke wondered much at that purpose, and
</p>
<p>thought it very unliklie ; yet he affirmed that he could ne-

</p>
<p>ver perceive any such appearance in that gentleman's in-
</p>
<p>clination. But Maister Alexander perceiving His Majes-
</p>
<p>tie's privy conference with the Duke, and suspecting the
</p>
<p>purpose as it appeared, came to the King requesting His
</p>
<p>Majestie very earnestlie, he should make none living ac-
</p>
<p>quainted with that purpose, nor suffer none to go with His
</p>
<p>Majestie where he should convey him, but himself only,
</p>
<p>until His Majestie had once seen the fellow and his trea-
</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p>sure: whereunto His Majestie, half laughing* gave answere,
</p>
<p>that he was no good teller of money, and behoved there-
</p>
<p>fore to have some to help him in that errand. His reply
</p>
<p>was, that he would suffer none to see it but His Majestie's
</p>
<p>self at the first, but afterwards he might call in whom hee
</p>
<p>pleased.
</p>
<p>These speeches did so increase his suspition, that then
</p>
<p>hee beganne directlie to suspect some treasonable devise,
</p>
<p>yet many suspitions and thoughts overwhelming everie one
</p>
<p>another in his mind, His Majestie could resolve uppon
</p>
<p>no certain thing, but rode further on his journey, betwixt
</p>
<p>trust and distrust, being ashamed to seem to suspect, in
</p>
<p>respect of the cleannesse of His Majestie's own conscience,
</p>
<p>except he had found some greater ground. Maister Al-
</p>
<p>exander still pressing the King to ride faster, tho' his
</p>
<p>own horse was scarcelie able to keep company with the
</p>
<p>King for weariness, having ridden with him all the chase
</p>
<p>before, the King being come two miles from Falkland,
</p>
<p>Maister Alexander stayed a little behind the King in the
</p>
<p>way, and posted away the other servant Andrew Ruthven
</p>
<p>to the Earle his brother ; advertising him how far the King
</p>
<p>was on his way to come thither. Then how soone soever
</p>
<p>the King came within a mile of St. Johnstoun, he said to
</p>
<p>His Majestie, that he would post in before, to advertise
</p>
<p>the Earle his brother of His Majestie's coming : who, at
</p>
<p>his incoming to him was sitting at the midst of his dinner,
</p>
<p>never seeming to take knowledge of the King's coming,
</p>
<p>till his brother told it him, notwithstanding, that two of
</p>
<p>his servants had advertized him thereof before. And im-
</p>
<p>mediately upon his brother's report, rising in haste from
</p>
<p>the board and warning all the servants and friends to ac-
</p>
<p>company him to meet His Majestie; who met him with
</p>
<p>three or fourscore men at the end of the Inche, His Ma-
</p>
<p>jestie's whole traine, not exceeding the number of fifteen

<p>persons, and all without any kind of armour, except
</p>
<p>swordes, no, not so much as daggers or whingers; His
</p>
<p>Majestie stayed an hour after his coming to the said Earl's
</p>
<p>lodging in Saint Johnstoun before his dinner came in. The
</p>
<p>langsomeness of preparing the same, and badness of the
</p>
<p>cheere being excused upon the sodaine coming of His Ma-
</p>
<p>jestie, unlooked for there.
</p>
<p>During which time His Majestie enquired of Maister
</p>
<p>Alexander, when it was time for him to goe to that private
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>house about that matter whereof he had informed him : who
</p>
<p>answered him, that all was sure enough, but that there was
</p>
<p>no haste yet for an hour, till the King had dined at lei-
</p>
<p>zure, praying His Majestie to leave him and not to be
</p>
<p>scene to rounde with him before his brother, who, having
</p>
<p>missed him that morning might thereupon suspect what the
</p>
<p>matter should meane. Therefore His Majestie addressed
</p>
<p>himself to the Earle, and discoursed with him upon sun-
</p>
<p>drie matters, but could get no direct answer of him, but
</p>
<p>half wordes and imperfect sentences.
</p>
<p>His Majestie being set down to his dinner, the said Earle
</p>
<p>stood very pensive, and with a dejected countenance, at
</p>
<p>the end of His Majestie's table, oft rounding over his should-
</p>
<p>er, one while to one of his servants, and another while to
</p>
<p>another, and oftimes went out and in to the chamber.
</p>
<p>Which forme of behaviour, he likewise kept before the
</p>
<p>King's sitting downe to dinner, but without any welcom-
</p>
<p>ing of His Majestie, or any other hearty form of enter-
</p>
<p>tainment. The noblemen and gentlemen of the court that
</p>
<p>were with His Majestie standing about the table, and not
</p>
<p>desired to dine (as the use is when His Majestie is once set
</p>
<p>downe, and his first service brought up,) untill His Majes-
</p>
<p>tie had almost dined. At which time the Earle convoyed
</p>
<p>them forth to their dinner, but sat not downe with them
</p>
<p>himself (as the common manner is,) but came backe, and
</p>
<p>stood silent at the end of the King's table, as he did be-
</p>
<p>fore ; which His Majestie perceiving, beganne to entertaine
</p>
<p>the Earle in a homely manner, wondering he had not
</p>
<p>remained to dine with his guests, and entertayne them
</p>
<p>there.
</p>
<p>His Majestie being readie to rise from table, and all his
</p>
<p>servants in the hall at their dinner, Maister Alexander
</p>
<p>standing behind His Majestie's backe, pulled quietly upon
</p>
<p>him, rounding in His Majestie's care, that it was time to goe,

<p>but that hee would faine have been quit of the Earle his
</p>
<p>brother, wishing the King to send him out into the hall,
</p>
<p>to entertayne his guests, whereupone the King called for
</p>
<p>drinke, and in a merrie and homely manner, sayde to the
</p>
<p>Earle, that altho' the Earle had seen the fashion of enter-
</p>
<p>taynments, in other countries, yet he would teach him the
</p>
<p>Scotish fashion, seeing he was a Scotish man ; and there-
</p>
<p>fore, since he had forgotten to drink to His Majestie, or
</p>
<p>sit with his guests and entertayne them, His Majestie would
</p>
<p>B2
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>drink to him his owne welcome, desiring him to take it
</p>
<p>forth and drink to the rest of the company, and in His
</p>
<p>Majestie's name to make them welcome. Whereuppone,
</p>
<p>as he went forth, His Majestie rose from the table, and de-
</p>
<p>sired Maister Alexander to bring Sir Thomas Erskine with
</p>
<p>him ; who desiring the King to go forward with him, and
</p>
<p>promising that he should make any one or two to follow
</p>
<p>him that he pleased to call for, desiring His Majestie to
</p>
<p>command publickly, that none should follow him. Thus
</p>
<p>the King accompanied only with the sayde Maister Alex-
</p>
<p>ander, comes forth of the chamber, passeth through the
</p>
<p>end of the hall where the Noblemen and His Majestie's
</p>
<p>servants were sitting at their dinner, up a turnpeeck and
</p>
<p>thro' three or four chambers, the sayde Mr Alexander ever
</p>
<p>locking behind him every door as he passed : and then with
</p>
<p>a more smiling countenance than he had all the day be-
</p>
<p>fore, ever saying, he had him sure and safe enough kept, un-
</p>
<p>till at the last, His Majestie passing thro' three or four sund-
</p>
<p>rie houses, and all the doors locked behind him, His Ma-
</p>
<p>jestic entered into a little study, where he saw standing with
</p>
<p>an abased countenance, not a bondman, but a freeman,
</p>
<p>with a dagger at his girdle, but His Majestie had no soon-
</p>
<p>er entered into that little study and Maister Alexander with
</p>
<p>him, but Maister Alexander locked to the study door be-
</p>
<p>hind him, and at that instant changing his countenance,
</p>
<p>putting his hatte on his head, and drawing the dagger from
</p>
<p>that other man's girdle, held the point of it to the King's
</p>
<p>breast, avowing now that the King behoved to be in his
</p>
<p>will, and used as he list ; swearing many bloody oaths, that
</p>
<p>if the King cried one worde, or opened a window to look
</p>
<p>out, that dagger should presently go to his heart : affirm-
</p>
<p>ing that hee was sure that howe the King's conscience was
</p>
<p>burthened for murthering his Father. His Majestie won-
</p>
<p>dering at so sodaine an alteration, and standing naked

<p>without any kind of armour but his hunting horn, which
</p>
<p>he had not gotten leizure to lay from him, betwixt these
</p>
<p>two Traitors who had conspired his life ; the sayde Maisr
</p>
<p>ter Alexander standing (as sayde is) with a dagger in his
</p>
<p>hand, and his sword at his side ; but the other trembling
</p>
<p>and quaking, rather like one condemned, than an execu-
</p>
<p>tioner of such enterprise.
</p>
<p>His Majestie begunne then to dilatte to the sayde Mais-
</p>
<p>ter Alexander, how horrible a thing it was for him, to
</p>
<p>13
</p>
<p>meddle with His Majestie's innocent blood, assuring him
</p>
<p>it would not be left unrevenged, since God had given him
</p>
<p>children and good subjects, and if they neyther, yet God
</p>
<p>would raise uppe stocks and stones to punish so vile a deed.
</p>
<p>Protesting before God, that hee had no burthen in his con-
</p>
<p>science for the execution of his Father, both in respect that
</p>
<p>at the time of his Father's execution, His Majestic was but
</p>
<p>a minor of age, and guided at that time by a faction which
</p>
<p>over-ruled both His Majestie and the rest of the country ;
</p>
<p>as also that whatsoever was done to his Father, it was done
</p>
<p>by the ordinary course of law and justice. Appealing the
</p>
<p>sayde Maister Alexander upon his conscience, how well hee
</p>
<p>at all times since deserved at the hands of all his race, not
</p>
<p>only having restored them to all their lands and dignities,
</p>
<p>but also nourishing and bringing up of two or three of his
</p>
<p>Sisters, as it were in his owne bosome, by a continued at-
</p>
<p>tendance uppone His Majestie's dearest bed-fellow in her
</p>
<p>privy chamber.
</p>
<p>Laying also before him the terrors of his conscience, es-
</p>
<p>peciallie that hee made profession, according to his educa-
</p>
<p>tion, of the same religion that His Majestie had ever pro-
</p>
<p>fessed ; and namely, His Majestie remembered him of that
</p>
<p>holy man, Mr Robert Rollock, whose schollar hee was, as-
</p>
<p>suring him, that one day, the sayde Mr Robert's soule
</p>
<p>would accuse him, that hee never learned of him to practice
</p>
<p>such unnatural cruelty ; His Majestie promising to him, on
</p>
<p>the word of a Prince, that if hee would spare his life, and
</p>
<p>suffer him to go out againe, he never would reveale to any
</p>
<p>flesh living what was betwixt them at that time, nor never
</p>
<p>suffer him to incur any harm or punishment for the same.
</p>
<p>But His Majestie's fear was, that he could hope for no
</p>
<p>sparing at his hands, having such crueltie in his looks, and
</p>
<p>standing so irreverently with his hatte on, which form of
</p>
<p>rigorous behaviour, could prognosticate nothing to His

<p>Majestie but present extremitie. But, at His Majestie's
</p>
<p>pursuasive language, he appeared to be somewhat amazed,
</p>
<p>and uncovering his head, againe swore and protested that
</p>
<p>His Majestie's life should be safe if he would behave hiim-
</p>
<p>self quietly, without making noise or crying ; and that he
</p>
<p>would only bring in the Earle his brother to speake with
</p>
<p>His Majestie. Whereuppon His Majestie enquiring, what
</p>
<p>the Earle would do with him, since (if His Majestie's life
</p>
<p>mis safe according to promise) they could gain little in
</p>
<p>14
</p>
<p>keeping such a prisoner. His answere only was, that hee
</p>
<p>could tell His Majestie no more, but that his life should be
</p>
<p>safe, in case hee behaved himself quietlie, the Earl his bro-
</p>
<p>ther, whome hee was going for, would tell His Majestie at
</p>
<p>his coming. With that, as he was going forth for his bro-
</p>
<p>ther, as hee affirmed, hee turned him about to the other
</p>
<p>man, saying these wordes unto him, I make you here the
</p>
<p>King's keeper, till I come backe againe, and see that you
</p>
<p>keep him upon your own peril : and therewithall sayde to
</p>
<p>His Majestie, you must content yourselfe to have this man
</p>
<p>now for your keeper, till my coming backe.
</p>
<p>With these wordes, he passeth forth, locking the door
</p>
<p>behind him, leaving His Majestie, with that man he found
</p>
<p>there before him, of whom His Majestie then enquired, if
</p>
<p>he were appointed to be the murtherer of him at that time,
</p>
<p>and how farre he was upon the counseil of that conspiracy ?
</p>
<p>whose answer, with a trembling and astonished voice and
</p>
<p>behaviour was, That as the Lord should judge him, he was
</p>
<p>never made acquaynted with that purpose, but that he was
</p>
<p>put in there per force, and the door locked upon him, a
</p>
<p>little space before His Majestie's coming : as indeed all the
</p>
<p>time of the sayde Maister Alexander's menacing His Ma-
</p>
<p>jestie, hee was ever trembling, requesting him for God's
</p>
<p>sake, and with many other attestations, not to meddle with
</p>
<p>His Majestie, nor to do him any harme. But because
</p>
<p>Maister Alexander had, before his going forth, made the
</p>
<p>King swear hee should not cry nor open any window, His
</p>
<p>Majestie commanded the sayde fellow to open the window
</p>
<p>on his right hand, which hee reacliely did : so that altho*
</p>
<p>hee was put in there, to use violence on the King, yet God
</p>
<p>so turned his heart, as hee became a slave to his prisoner.
</p>
<p>While His Majestie was in this dangerous estate, and
</p>
<p>none of his own servants, nor traine knowing where hee
</p>
<p>was, and as His Majestie's traine was arising in the halle from

<p>their dinner, the Earle of Gowrie being present with them,
</p>
<p>one of the Earle of Gowrie's servants comes hastily in, as-
</p>
<p>suring the Earle his Maister, that His Majestie was horsed
</p>
<p>and away thro' the Inche; which the Earle reporting to the
</p>
<p>noblemen and the rest of His Majestie's traine that was there
</p>
<p>present, they all rushed out together at the gate in great
</p>
<p>baste: and some of His Majestie's servants enquiring of the
</p>
<p>Porter, when His Majesty went forth ? The Porter affirm-
</p>
<p>ed that the King was not yet gone forth. Whereuppone
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>the Earle looked very angrilie upon him, and sayde he was
</p>
<p>but a liar, yet turning him to the Duke, and to the Earle
</p>
<p>of Mar sayde, he would presently get them sure word
</p>
<p>where His Majestie was : and w r ith that, ranne through the
</p>
<p>close, and up the staires. But his purpose indeed was to
</p>
<p>speak to his brother, as appeared very well by the circum-
</p>
<p>stance of time, his brother having at that same instant left
</p>
<p>the King in the little study, and ranne down the stairs in
</p>
<p>great haste.
</p>
<p>Immediately after, the Earle cometh back running a-
</p>
<p>gaine to the gate, where the noblemen and the rest were
</p>
<p>standing in amaze, assuring them that the King was gone
</p>
<p>long since out at the back yette, and if they hasted them
</p>
<p>not the sooner, they would not overtake him: and with
</p>
<p>that, called for his horse ; whereat they rushed all together
</p>
<p>out at the gate, and made towards the Inche, crying all for
</p>
<p>their horses; passing all as it was the providence of God un-
</p>
<p>der one of the windows of the study wherein His Majestie
</p>
<p>was. Mr Alexander very speediely returned, and at his.
</p>
<p>incomming to His Majestie, casting his hands abroad in a
</p>
<p>desperate manner, sayde, hee could not mend it ; His Ma-
</p>
<p>jestie behoved to die; and with that, offered a garter to
</p>
<p>bind His Majestie's hands with, swearing he behoved to be
</p>
<p>bound.
</p>
<p>His Majestie at that word of binding, sayde, he was
</p>
<p>born a free King, and should die a free King. Whereup-
</p>
<p>pon hee gripping His Majestie by the wrest of the hand, to
</p>
<p>have bound him, His Majestie sodainly relieved himself of
</p>
<p>his gripps : whereuppon, as he put his right hand to his
</p>
<p>sword, His Majestie with his right hand seized upon both
</p>
<p>his hand and his sworde, and with his left hand clasped
</p>
<p>him by the throat, like as he with his left hand claspt the
</p>
<p>King by the throat, with two or three of his fingers in His
</p>
<p>Majestie's mouth, to have stayed him from crying : in this

</p>
<p>manner of wrestling His Majestie per force drove him to
</p>
<p>the window, which hee had caused the other man to open
</p>
<p>unto him, and under the which was passing by at the same
</p>
<p>time the King's traine, and the Earle of Gowrie with then},
</p>
<p>as is sayde, and holding out the right side of his head and
</p>
<p>right elbow, cried that they were murthering him there in
</p>
<p>that treasonable forme ; w r hose voice being instantly heard
</p>
<p>and knowne by the Duke of Lennox and the Earle of Mar,
</p>
<p>and the rest of His Majestie's train there, the said Earle of
</p>
<p>16
</p>
<p>Gowrie ever asking what it meant ? and never seeming any
</p>
<p>waves to have seene His Majestie, or heard his voice, they
</p>
<p>all rushed in at the gate together, the Duke and the Earle
</p>
<p>of Mar, running about to come by that passage His Majes-
</p>
<p>tie came in at. But the Earle of Gowrie and his servants
</p>
<p>made them for another way up a quiet turnpeek, which
</p>
<p>was ever condemned before, and was only then left open
</p>
<p>(as appeared) for that purpose. And in this meantime His
</p>
<p>Majestie with struggling and wrestling with the sayde
</p>
<p>Maister Alexander, had brought him per force, out of that
</p>
<p>study, the door whereof, for haste, had been left open at
</p>
<p>his last incomming, and His Majesty having gotten (with
</p>
<p>long struggling) the sayde Maister Alexander's head under
</p>
<p>his arme, and himself oh his knee, His Majestie drove him
</p>
<p>backe per force hard to the door of the sayde turnpeek, and
</p>
<p>as His Majestie was throwing his sword out of his hand,
</p>
<p>thinking to have stricken him therewith, and then to have
</p>
<p>shotte him over the staire, the other fellow standing behind
</p>
<p>the King's back and doing nothing but trembling all the
</p>
<p>time, Sir John Ramsay not knowing which way first to en-
</p>
<p>ter, after he had heard the King's cry, by chance finds that
</p>
<p>turnpeek doore open, and following it up to the head, en-
</p>
<p>ters into the chamber, and finds His Majestie and Maister
</p>
<p>Alexander struggling in that forme, as is before sayde, and
</p>
<p>after hee had twice or thrice stricken Maister Alexander
</p>
<p>with his dagger, the other man withdrew himselfe, His
</p>
<p>Majestie still keeping his grippes, and holding him close
</p>
<p>to him : immediately thereafter he tooke the sayde Maister
</p>
<p>Alexander by the shoulders, and shotte him down the stair,
</p>
<p>who was no sooner shotte out at the doore, but hee was
</p>
<p>met by Sir Thomas Erskine and Sir Hew Harris, who
</p>
<p>there, upon the stair, ended him ; the sayde Sir Thomas
</p>
<p>Erskine being cast behind the Duke and the Earle of Mar,
</p>
<p>that ran about the other way by the occasion of his med-

<p>dling with the sayde late Earle in the street after the hear-
</p>
<p>ing of His Majestie's cry. For upon the hearing thereof
</p>
<p>he had clasped the Earle of Gowrye by the gorget, and
</p>
<p>casting him under his feet, and wanting a dagger to have
</p>
<p>strucken him with, the sayde Earle's men rid the Earle
</p>
<p>their Maister out of his hands ; whereby he was cast be-
</p>
<p>hind the rest as is said; and missing the company, and
</p>
<p>hearing the sayde Sir John Ramsay's voice upon the turn-
</p>
<p>peek head, ranne up to the said chamber, and cryed upon
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>the sayde Sir Hew Harris and another servant to follow
</p>
<p>him : where, meeting with the sayde Mr Alexander in the
</p>
<p>turnpeek, he ended him there, as is sayde ; Alexander cry-
</p>
<p>ing for his last wordes, alas ! I had not the wyte of it. But
</p>
<p>no sooner could the said Sir Thomas, Sir Hew, and ano-
</p>
<p>ther servant winne into the chamber where His Majestie
</p>
<p>was, but that the sayde Earle of Gowrye, before they could
</p>
<p>get the doore shut followed them in the back, having cast
</p>
<p>him to come up that privy passage as is before sayde : who,
</p>
<p>at his first entry, having a drawne sworde in everie hand,
</p>
<p>and a steel bonnet on his head, accompanied with seven
</p>
<p>of his servants, everie one of them having in like manner
</p>
<p>a drawn sworde, cried out with a great oath, that they
</p>
<p>should all die as traitors. All which time, His Majestie
</p>
<p>was still in the chamber, who, seeing the Earle of Gowrye
</p>
<p>come in with his swordes in his hands, sought for Maister
</p>
<p>Alexander's sworde which had fallen from him, at his out-
</p>
<p>shutting at the doore, having no sort of weapons of his
</p>
<p>owne, as is sayde ; but then was shut backe by his owne
</p>
<p>servants, that were there, into the little study, and the
</p>
<p>doore shut upon him: who, having put His Majestie in
</p>
<p>safety, rencountred the sayde Earle and his servants, His
</p>
<p>Majestie's servants being only in number four, to wit, Sir
</p>
<p>Thomas Erskine, Sir Hew Harris, Sir John Ramsay, and
</p>
<p>one Wilson, a servant of James Erskine's, brother of the
</p>
<p>sayde Sir Thomas, the sayde Earle having seven of his own
</p>
<p>servants with him : yet it pleased God, after many strokes
</p>
<p>on all hands, to give His Majestie's servants the victorie,
</p>
<p>the said Earle of Gowrye being stricken dead with a stroke
</p>
<p>thro' the heart, which the saide Sir John Ramsay gave
</p>
<p>him, without once crying upon God, and the rest of his ser-
</p>
<p>vants dung over the stairs with many hurts, as in like man-
</p>
<p>ner the said Sir Thomas Erskine, Sir Hew Harris, and
</p>
<p>Sir John Ramsay, were all three very sore hurt and

<p>wounded.
</p>
<p>But all the time of this fight, the Duke of Lennox, the
</p>
<p>Earle of Mar, and the rest of His Majestie's traine, were
</p>
<p>striking with great hammers at the outer doore, whereby
</p>
<p>His Majestie passed up to the chamber with the said Mais-
</p>
<p>ter' Alexander, which also he had locked in his by coming
</p>
<p>with His Majestie to the chamber, but by reason of the
</p>
<p>strength of the sayde double doore, the whole wall being
</p>
<p>likewise of boards, and yielding with the strokes : it did
</p>
<p>18
</p>
<p>bide them the space of half an houre and more before they
</p>
<p>could get it broken, and have entransie, who, having met
</p>
<p>with His Majestic, delivered from so imminent a perill, and
</p>
<p>the said late Earle, the principal conspirator, lying dead
</p>
<p>at His Majestie's feet, immediately thereafter, His Ma-
</p>
<p>jestie kneeling down on his knees, in the midst of his owne
</p>
<p>servants, and they all kneeling round about him, His Ma^
</p>
<p>jestie out of his owne mouth, thanked God for that mira-
</p>
<p>culous deliverance and victory, assuring himself, that God
</p>
<p>had preserved him from so despaird a perill, for the per-
</p>
<p>fecting of some greater work behind, to his glory, and for
</p>
<p>procuring by him the weale of his people, that God had
</p>
<p>committed to his charge. After this, the tumult of the
</p>
<p>town hearing of the slaughter of the sayde Earle of Gowrye,
</p>
<p>the Provost, and not knowing the manner thereof, nor be-
</p>
<p>ing of the counsail of his treasonable attempt, continued
</p>
<p>for the space of two or three hours thereafter, untill His
</p>
<p>Majestie, by speaking oft to them out of the windows, and
</p>
<p>beckoning to them with his own hand, pacified them,
</p>
<p>causing the Bailliflfes and the rest of the honest men of the
</p>
<p>town to be brought into the chamber ; to whome, having
</p>
<p>declared the whole forme of that strange accident, he com-
</p>
<p>mitted the house and bodies of the sayde traitorous brethren
</p>
<p>to their keeping, untill His Majestie's further pleasure were
</p>
<p>known. His Majestie having before his parting out of the
</p>
<p>towne caused searche the sayde Earle of Gowrye's pockets,
</p>
<p>in case any letters that might further the discovery of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy might be found therein. But nothing was found
</p>
<p>in them, but a little close parchment bag full of magical
</p>
<p>charracters and wordes of inchantment, wherein it seemed
</p>
<p>that he had put his confidence, thinking himself never safe
</p>
<p>without them, and therefore ever carried them about with
</p>
<p>him ; being also observed, that while they were uppon him,
</p>
<p>his wound whereof he died bled not, but incontinent after

<p>the taking of them away, the blood gushed out in great a-
</p>
<p>bundance, to the great admiration of all the beholders : an
</p>
<p>infamy which hath followed and spotted the race of this
</p>
<p>house for many descents, as is notoriously known to the
</p>
<p>whole countrie.
</p>
<p>Thus, the night was far spent, being near eight hours
</p>
<p>of the evening before His Majestie could (for the great tu-
</p>
<p>mult that was in the towne,) depart out of the same. But,
</p>
<p>before His Majestie had ridden four myles out of the same
</p>
<p>19
</p>
<p>towards Falkland, although the night was very dark ana
</p>
<p>rainy, the whole way was clad with all sort of people, both
</p>
<p>horse and foot, meeting him with great joy and acclama-
</p>
<p>tion. The frequence and concourse of persons of all de-
</p>
<p>grees to Falkland the rest of the week, and to Edinburgh
</p>
<p>the next, from all the quarters of the countrie, the testimo-
</p>
<p>nie of the subjects hearty affection and joy for His Majes-
</p>
<p>tie's delivery, expressed every where, by ringing of bells,
</p>
<p>bone-fires, shooting off guns of all sortes, both by sea and
</p>
<p>land, &c. with all other things ensuing thereuppon, I have
</p>
<p>of set purpose pretermitted, as well knowne to all men,
</p>
<p>and impertinent to this discourse, contenting myself with
</p>
<p>this plain and simple narration, adding only, for explana-
</p>
<p>tion and confirmation thereof, the depositions of certain
</p>
<p>persons who were either actors, or eye-witnesses, or imme-
</p>
<p>diate hearers of those things that they declare and testifie ;
</p>
<p>wherein, if the reader shall find any thing differing from
</p>
<p>the narration, either in substance or circumstance, he may
</p>
<p>understand the same to be uttered by the deponer, in his
</p>
<p>owne behoof, for obtaining His Majestie's princely grace
</p>
<p>and favour.
</p>
<p>The above is the Narrative published by authority,
</p>
<p>some weeks after the 5th August, 1600. We are in the
</p>
<p>next place, to give the following, more circumstantial, ac-
</p>
<p>count of the matter.
</p>
<p>Early in the morning of Tuesday, the fifth of August,
</p>
<p>1600, the Honourable Alexander Ruthven, brother to
</p>
<p>John Earl of Go wry, went from his brother's house in
</p>
<p>Perth, to Falkland, where the King James the Sixth, then
</p>
<p>resided. He found the King at buck-hunting, and joined
</p>
<p>in the sport. It was near mid-day before the chase was
</p>
<p>ended, when the King, with a number of attendants, and
</p>
<p>amongst the rest Alexander rode to Perth, and alighted
</p>
<p>at the Earl of Gowrys house. The Earl had just sat down

</p>
<p>to dinner with three neighbouring gentlemen, when he was
</p>
<p>informed of the King's approach by his brother Alexander,
</p>
<p>who had for that purpose, come on before the Royal Party
</p>
<p>the last mile of the way. On receiving the information
</p>
<p>the Earl rose from table, in a hurry, and surprise, and with
</p>
<p>his guests and servants hastened out, till he met the ca*
</p>
<p>C2
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>valcade. But the family dinner being over, he was at s
</p>
<p>loss how to entertain His Majesty and such a company,
</p>
<p>most of whom had been on horseback, ever since six
</p>
<p>o'clock in the morning ; and an hour elapsed, after their
</p>
<p>arrival, before dinner could be prepared. After dinner,
</p>
<p>the King and Alexander Ruthven retired by themselves :
</p>
<p>Some of the King's attendants armed followed and
</p>
<p>stabbed Alexander. Whilst this was going on within
</p>
<p>the house, Thomas and James Erskin, nephews to the
</p>
<p>late Regent Earl of Mar, attacked Gowry, who was stand-
</p>
<p>ing on the street before the gate of his own house : but
</p>
<p>Alexander Ruthven of Forgan felled Thomas Erskin to
</p>
<p>the ground with his fist, having no other weapon in rea-
</p>
<p>dieness. This, together with the interference of one or two
</p>
<p>of Gowry's servants, discomfited the Erskin s without doors :
</p>
<p>they then went up stairs and joined the Party which had
</p>
<p>stabbed Alexander Ruthven. According to their own ac-
</p>
<p>count, they met him near the bottom of the stairs, still a-
</p>
<p>live, but desperately wounded, being stabbeq! in several
</p>
<p>parts of his body by swords or daggers. There they dis-
</p>
<p>patched him. The Earl attended by his principal domes-
</p>
<p>tic Thomas Cranston, both armed, now followed up-stairs,
</p>
<p>and entered the apartment where John Ramsay, Thomas
</p>
<p>Erskin, Hugh Harris a Surgeon or Physician, and George
</p>
<p>Wilson a servant of James Erskin's were. Eager, no doubt,
</p>
<p>to learn the nature of the rencontre ; of which he evident-
</p>
<p>ly knew nothing : he tried to defend himself against their
</p>
<p>superior numbers. Rut at last one of them, by saying,
</p>
<p>" You have killed the King our Master, and will you ai-
</p>
<p>so take our lives ?" so astonished him that he rested the
</p>
<p>points of his swords (for he had one in each hand,) on the
</p>
<p>ground, and by so doing laid himself open to the attacks
</p>
<p>of the assassins. Such an opportunity was not to be ne-
</p>
<p>glected. Ramsay, from behind, stabbed him thro' the heart.

<p>- The report of the disturbance was instantly sent thro'
</p>
<p>the town of Perth, and the inhabitants suspecting, that
</p>
<p>James and his train had murdered the two brothers with-
</p>
<p>out provocation, became extremely tumultuous ; surround-
</p>
<p>ed the house, and in the most opprobrious terms, even
</p>
<p>threatened the King and his friends, with instant destruc-
</p>
<p>tion. After this uproar, (in which many of the better sort
</p>
<p>of people were engaged,) had continued several hours,
</p>
<p>some court parasites, as William Murray Son to John
</p>
<p>21
</p>
<p>Murray of Tullibardine, David Murray Son to Andrew*
</p>
<p>Murray of Balvaird, and one or two of the Magistrates,
</p>
<p>partly be soothing, and partly by threats, prevailed on the
</p>
<p>populace to disperse. It was given out that the King caus-
</p>
<p>ed search the pockets of the Earl and his brother after their
</p>
<p>death, for letters, or such other papers, as might throw
</p>
<p>any kind of light on the matter, and by that means dis-
</p>
<p>cover their accomplices : but tho' they discovered nothing
</p>
<p>that could be of any service that way, they pretended to
</p>
<p>make a much more extraordinary discovery. If we can
</p>
<p>credit their assertion, they found out, that the Earl was
</p>
<p>not merely a traitor, he was also a magician or dabbler in
</p>
<p>witchcraft, for they took from his pocket " a bag full of ma-
</p>
<p>gical characters and words of enchantment, wherein it
</p>
<p>seemed he had put his confidence." And according to the
</p>
<p>same account, the necromantic power of these talismans
</p>
<p>was clearly established at that time, for " while they were
</p>
<p>upon him, the wound whereof he died bled not; but in-
</p>
<p>continent after the taking of them away, the blood gushed
</p>
<p>out in great abundance." About eight o'clock in the even-
</p>
<p>ing, James and his party, after directing the remaining
</p>
<p>Magistrates of Perth (Gowry was Provost,) to take charge
</p>
<p>of the dead bodies, made the best of their way to Falkland.
</p>
<p>On the morrow, August the sixth, by ten o'clock fore-
</p>
<p>noon, the Privy Council at Edinburgh received by express,
</p>
<p>the King's account of the transaction, and along with it
</p>
<p>an injunction, to command the Clergy of that city instantly
</p>
<p>to convene the people in the churches, and publicly thank
</p>
<p>God for His Majestie's deliverance. The Clergymen wait-
</p>
<p>ed on the Council and heard the King's narration, but un-
</p>
<p>luckily, John Graham of Balgowan who accompanied the
</p>
<p>King from Falkland to Perth, arrived in the meantime in
</p>
<p>Edinburgh and gave a detail of the affair; and David
</p>

<p>written account of it, which had arrived an hour sooner
</p>
<p>in the city, than the government express. The authors of
</p>
<p>these several accounts having neglected to compare notes,
</p>
<p>the want of that precaution spoiled all ; there being a great
</p>
<p>discrepancy betwixt all the three. This caused the Cler-
</p>
<p>gymen to hesitate, and retire by themselves to consult what
</p>
<p>steps were the most proper for them to take. Whilst em-
</p>
<p>ployed in that, a macer again charged them to appear be-
</p>
<p>fore the Council. But they still persisted in refusing to in-
</p>
<p>22
</p>
<p>suit The Almighty, by making an extraordinary profession
</p>
<p>of thanksgiving for deliverance from danger, which pro-
</p>
<p>bably never existed : desiring a little time, that they might
</p>
<p>enquire into the matter, and declaring, that if they were
</p>
<p>then satisfied of the reality of the conspiracy against the
</p>
<p>King, they would not only cordially join in a general thanks-
</p>
<p>giving, but diligently promulgate the wickedness of the
</p>
<p>Earl of Gowry and his associates.
</p>
<p>But the Lords of Council would admit of no delay.
</p>
<p>However, during the altercation, Mr David Lindsay, Bis-
</p>
<p>hop of Ross and Minister of Leith, arrived from Falkland,
</p>
<p>and as he had heard the history of the plot from the King
</p>
<p>himself, it was thought best to employ him in relating the
</p>
<p>circumstances to the people, publicly, and returning thanks
</p>
<p>to God for the signal deliverance. Accordingly such mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the Privy Council as were then in town accompani-
</p>
<p>ed him to the market place, and he went thro' that exercise
</p>
<p>before four o'clock in the afternoon. The bells were then
</p>
<p>rung, and great guns fired, and in the evening, bone-fires
</p>
<p>were lighted in the streets, and on the hill-tops thro' the
</p>
<p>whole country.
</p>
<p>In the evening too, the Master of Orkney and Sir James-
</p>
<p>Sandilands, having a troop of horse under their command,
</p>
<p>rode out to Dirleton, where the Earl of Gowry's only two
</p>
<p>surviving brothers resided with the Countess Dowager their
</p>
<p>mother, for the purpose of apprehending and bringing the
</p>
<p>youths to Edinburgh. But they got notice of the impend-
</p>
<p>ing danger, and escaped half an hour before the arrival of
</p>
<p>the troopers. ,
</p>
<p>On Saturday the Ninth of August, one James Weemys
</p>
<p>of Bogie, who had occasionally frequented Gowry's house,
</p>
<p>was examined before the crown officers at Falkland. And
</p>
<p>on Monday King James crossed to Leith, and joined in a
</p>
<p>public thanksgiving with Lindsay the minister, and in-

</p>
<p>habitants of that town, and several of the nobility, who
</p>
<p>met in the church. That same afternoon, he went to E-
</p>
<p>dinburgh, and caused convene the people. He, and Gal-
</p>
<p>loway his chaplain, then went up to the top of the cross,
</p>
<p>around which they were assembled, and Galloway har-
</p>
<p>rangued them, choosing for the ground of his discourse the
</p>
<p>124 Psalm, and in course of the oration, related the seve-
</p>
<p>ral circumstances which were said to have taken place at
</p>
<p>Falkland and Perth on the preceding Tuesday. James,
</p>
<p>23
</p>
<p>with his usual dignity, then addressed the mob, confirm-
</p>
<p>ing all that Galloway had said. The Farce was conclud-
</p>
<p>ed by praising God for his extraordinary interposition in
</p>
<p>preserving the King.
</p>
<p>Next day, Tuesday the twelfth of August, the refrac-
</p>
<p>tory Clergy of Edinburgh were taken to task by the King
</p>
<p>and Council, for their want of faith in the conspiracy, On
</p>
<p>this occasion, much altercation took place. At first they
</p>
<p>insisted on a delay that they might have better information.
</p>
<p>James would not agree to this, because in his opinion, they
</p>
<p>already had evidence sufficient. " Ye have heard me,"
</p>
<p>said he, " ye have heard my minister," meaning Galloway,
</p>
<p>" ye have heard my Council, ye have heard the Earl of
</p>
<p>Mar, are ye fully pursuaded or not ?" Bruce, one of the
</p>
<p>Clergymen offered before the Council to believe the story,
</p>
<p>if Henderson should be hanged, and at his execution ad-
</p>
<p>here to his declaration. The Comptroller Murray of Tul-
</p>
<p>libardine said to Bruce, " Will you believe a condemned
</p>
<p>man better than the King?" " If he die penitent," replied
</p>
<p>Bruce, " I will trust him. If God receive his soul, I will
</p>
<p>receive his testimony." The result was, that the Clergy
</p>
<p>were banished the city, and discharged preaching in the
</p>
<p>King's dominions under pain of death. All of them how-
</p>
<p>ever, except Mr Bruce, soon submitted, and were again
</p>
<p>received into favour ; only as an expiation for the crime,
</p>
<p>each of them had several churches in different parts of the
</p>
<p>nation, allotted them, in which they made their recanta-
</p>
<p>tion. Bruce was confined sometime, and then ordered in-
</p>
<p>to banishment ; but was afterwards allowed to return, on
</p>
<p>condition, that he confined himself to Inverness, but ne-
</p>
<p>ver was allowed to preach openly whilst James lived in Scot-
</p>
<p>land.
</p>
<p>James declared that there was a man in the turret, to which
</p>
<p>4he Honourable Alexander Ruthven led him, on the fifth

<p>of August, having a dagger at his girdle, but he ran off
</p>
<p>when Ramsay entered. It was of the very utmost import-
</p>
<p>ance that this person should be discovered. Several were
</p>
<p>fixed on successively who were said to be this man. At
</p>
<p>length, a pardon and offer of a considerable reward being
</p>
<p>held out to whoever should come forward and acknowledge
</p>
<p>himself to have been the unknown person in the study,
</p>
<p>Andrew Henderson, the Earl of Gowry's chamberlain or
</p>
<p>factor, was induced to avow himself to have been this trair
</p>
<p>24
</p>
<p>torous accomplice. He was then imprisoned, and on a
</p>
<p>precognition taken at Falkland on the twentieth of August,
</p>
<p>gave a detail of the whole affair, till the entry of John
</p>
<p>Ramsay into the chamber, where the King and Alexander
</p>
<p>Ruth ven were struggling, when he said that he left it. Hen-
</p>
<p>derson was the principal witness on the trial.
</p>
<p>On the thirteenth of August, a proclamation was is-
</p>
<p>sued, discharging all persons of the surname of Ruthven
</p>
<p>from coming near the King under pain of treason. By
</p>
<p>another, on the ninth of October, they were charged to go
</p>
<p>into banishment. But by a third proclamation, which
</p>
<p>came forth on the eighteenth of November, they were al-
</p>
<p>lowed to remain in the country on changing their names ;
</p>
<p>only they were prohibited from coming within ten miles of
</p>
<p>any place where the King was, under the pain of treason.
</p>
<p>In the precognition taken at Falkland on the 20th of
</p>
<p>August, Mr Rynd, who accompanied Earl Gowry in his
</p>
<p>travels, was examined. It would appear, that at first, his
</p>
<p>evidence had not been such as was wanted. They, there-
</p>
<p>fore, were under the necessity of putting him in the boots,
</p>
<p>and by that mean forcing what they wished for out of him.
</p>
<p>The purport of his declaration, as handed down to us, tends
</p>
<p>to shew that the Earl was a dabbler in witchcraft, and to
</p>
<p>implicate him in the conspiracy, by shewing, that he went
</p>
<p>hand in hand with his brother in both planning and exe-
</p>
<p>cuting it. Henderson's declaration was taken at the same
</p>
<p>time. And on the 22d of August, Rynd was again ques-
</p>
<p>tioned whether or not he had ever heard the Earl give his
</p>
<p>opinion how an important undertaking ought to be con-
</p>
<p>ducted. He answered, that when abroad, he had several
</p>
<p>times heard Gowry say, that he was a fool who on such oc-
</p>
<p>casions, imparted his intention to any one.
</p>
<p>On Saturday the 23d of August, three of Gowry's ser-
</p>
<p>vants were hanged at Perth. One of these was Thomas

<p>Cranston, who accompanied his Master up stairs, armed,
</p>
<p>and was present when he was slain. Another was George
</p>
<p>Craigengelt, who was sick a-bed, but got up, when he heard
</p>
<p>that the two brothers were killed, and repairing to the court
</p>
<p>or street where the rioters were assembled, was observed to
</p>
<p>make use of some words which were considered as disre-
</p>
<p>spectful to the King. The third was the Earl's Baron of-
</p>
<p>ficer of Strathbraan, who was seen in the court with a
</p>
<p>sword drawn in his hand.
</p>
<p>25
</p>
<p>The first of November was the day fixed on for the trial
</p>
<p>of Earl Gowiy, and his brother the Honourable Alexander
</p>
<p>Ruthven. And for that purpose, the Parliament was sum-
</p>
<p>moned to meet at Edinburgh. It was adjourned to the
</p>
<p>fourth of the month, on which day, Sir Thomas Hamilton,
</p>
<p>King's advocate, produced a summons of treason, duly ex-
</p>
<p>ecuted, against William Ruthven, brother and apparent
</p>
<p>heir to John Earl of Gowry, and to Mr Alexander Ruth-
</p>
<p>ven, calling also in the summons, the tutors of the said
</p>
<p>William, and all others having interest in the matter, to
</p>
<p>hear it found, that the said Earl of Gowrie, and Alexan-
</p>
<p>der his brother had committed treason, in attempting the
</p>
<p>murder of the King at Perth, on the fifth of August last
</p>
<p>by-past. The Heralds and Messengers were sworn to the
</p>
<p>veracity of the execution,* both at the private houses of
</p>
<p>the persons summoned ; at the market-cross of the Shire-
</p>
<p>town ; and at the pier of Leith.
</p>
<p>None of the parties appearing on the fourth, except the
</p>
<p>putrid bodies of the Earl and Alexander, which having
</p>
<p>been brought from Perth, were placed at the bar, the matter
</p>
<p>lay over till the ninth, when the above-mentioned summons
</p>
<p>and executions were again read over, and at same time
</p>
<p>other summonses and executions were produced, and sworn
</p>
<p>to against Alexander and Hary Ruthvens sons of Alex-
</p>
<p>ander Ruthven of Freeland; Hugh Moncrieffe, brother of
</p>
<p>William Moncrieffe of that Ilk ; and Patrick Eviot brother
</p>
<p>to Colin Eviot of Balhousie; as being guilty of the same
</p>
<p>crime. The parties, as usual, were thrice called, but none
</p>
<p>of them appeared, only Alexander Henderson was brought
</p>
<p>by the Magistrates of Edinburgh from their prison, where
</p>
<p>he had been confined, and sisted at the bar; he having
</p>
<p>been likewise summoned, as guilty of treason. As no o-
</p>
<p>ther of the accused persons appeared, the Crown Lawyers
</p>
<p>took Instruments, and at same time, produced letters of

<p>relaxation executed in proper form, freeing all the parties
</p>
<p>summoned from arrestment or trouble of any kind, on e-
</p>
<p>very other account, so as they might have freedom to com-
</p>
<p>pear, and plead to this charge of high treason. On which
</p>
<p>production he likewise took Instruments.
</p>
<p>D
</p>
<p>* In Scotch law, an execution is a Certificate, signed by the Messenger who
</p>
<p>gives the Summons and two witnesses, declaring that the Summons has been
</p>
<p>regularly delivered. In the present instance, the Summonses were executed
</p>
<p>en the 28th and 29th of August,
</p>
<p>26
</p>
<p>The Parliament then remitted Henderson to prison>
</p>
<p>and adjourned to the 1 5th.
</p>
<p>Having met on the 15th the public prosecutor went
</p>
<p>thro' the former formalities, of reading the summons and
</p>
<p>executions thereon, and taking the oaths of the Heralds as
</p>
<p>to their having legally served the summons. No one,
</p>
<p>however, the two Corpses excepted, appeared ; only a par-
</p>
<p>don was produced for Henderson, subscribed by the King.
</p>
<p>The trial then went on. The Court, as usual, first pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to try the relevancy of the Libel, of which there
</p>
<p>could be no doubt, and then the evidence was taken by the
</p>
<p>Lords of the Articles. Lennox and Mar were two of these*
</p>
<p>The others were Earls Errol, and Marischel, Lords Sea-
</p>
<p>ton, Livingston, New-battle, and Fivie, two Bishops, four
</p>
<p>Abbots^ seven Barons, and nine Commissioners of Burghs.
</p>
<p>A considerable number of witnesses were examined,
</p>
<p>whose depositions are given at large in the proper place.
</p>
<p>That same day, the Parliament, without a dissenting voice,
</p>
<p>found the two brothers guilty of treason, and passed sen-
</p>
<p>tence of forfeiture against their property, declared their
</p>
<p>posterity infamous, and ordained their dead bodies to be
</p>
<p>hanged, &c. at the cross of Edinburgh.
</p>
<p>The Parliament was not satisfied with passing an act,
</p>
<p>disinheriting, and inhabilitating the brethren of the Earl
</p>
<p>of Gowry, and all his posterity, from enjoying any heritage,
</p>
<p>place, or office, within Scotland ; but it discharged all per-
</p>
<p>sons whatsoever to move or intercede for them, under high
</p>
<p>pains.
</p>
<p>By another act, the surname of Iiuthven was appoint-
</p>
<p>ed to be abolished for ever, and such of them as were in-
</p>
<p>nocent of this treason, were ordained to take other names.
</p>
<p>This Parliament likewise passed sentence of death and
</p>
<p>forfeiture against Alexander and Hary, the two sons of
</p>
<p>Alexander Ruthven of Freeland, Hugh Moncrieffe, bro-

<p>ther to William Moncrieffe of Moncrieffe, and Patrick E-
</p>
<p>viot, brother to Colin Eviot of Balhousie; and declared
</p>
<p>their posterity infamous.
</p>
<p>Agreeable to the sentence, on Monday the nineteenth
</p>
<p>of November*, the putrid bodies of the Earl and his bro-
</p>
<p>* By a remarkable coincidence, the same day on which the extreme sen-
</p>
<p>tence of the law was executed on the bodies of the two brothers, that infa-
</p>
<p>tuated Prince, Charles the first was born. A Prince who afterwards lost his-
</p>
<p>crown and his life for an undue attachment to those principles, opposition to
</p>
<p>which, at this time, occasioned the death of Earl Gowry and his brother.
</p>
<p>27
</p>
<p>#ier Alexander were dragged to the cross of Edinburgh,
</p>
<p>and there hanged, drawn and quartered. Their heads
</p>
<p>were fixed on the top of the prison of that city ; and their
</p>
<p>limbs were exposed on the most conspicuous places in four
</p>
<p>of the principal towns of the kingdom, viz. Edinburgh,
</p>
<p>Perth, Dundee, and Stirling.
</p>
<p>William Ruthven, the next brother, after his escape
</p>
<p>from Dirlton, went to France, where he acquired a know-
</p>
<p>ledge of chemistry. He married a daughter of the famous
</p>
<p>painter, Van Dyke, and died in France.
</p>
<p>Patrick, the fifth brother, fled to England, where, on
</p>
<p>James' accession to the throne, he was seized and confined
</p>
<p>in the tower of London. He attained some celebrity in
</p>
<p>the practice of physick, but as he took no fees, he never
</p>
<p>was rich.
</p>
<p>Such of their sisters as were alive and unmarried, were
</p>
<p>allowed to remain privately in the country unmolested.
</p>
<p>Their uncle, Alexander, was banished by proclama-
</p>
<p>tion, on the ninth of October, and so, being incapable of
</p>
<p>making any defence, he was forfeited at the trial.
</p>
<p>Before breaking up, this Parliament passed an Act, ap-
</p>
<p>pointing the fifth of August ever after to be annually ob-
</p>
<p>served as a day of Public Thanksgiving, for the King's
</p>
<p>deliverance.
</p>
<p>On the fifteenth of November, the very day on which
</p>
<p>the Earl's estates were annexed to the crown, James grant-
</p>
<p>ed a thousand pounds out of the Scone estate, to the poor,
</p>
<p>in annuity.
</p>
<p>The remainder of Gowry's property, and his offices,
</p>
<p>were, with other places and honours, bestowed on those of
</p>
<p>James' friends, who were most zealous in his service, at
</p>
<p>Perth, when the brothers were slain.
</p>
<p>John Ramsay had an annuity of a thousand pounds be-
</p>
<p>stowed on him ; (no inconsiderable grant, at a time when

<p>James himself was glad of a pension of five thousand
</p>
<p>pounds Sterling) Ramsay was afterwards created Viscount
</p>
<p>Haddington, and lastly Earl of Heldernesse.
</p>
<p>Thomas Erskin was rewarded with the estate of Dirl-
</p>
<p>ton; and in 1603 was created Lord Dirlton. On the fall
</p>
<p>of Sir Walter Raleigh, after the King went to England,
</p>
<p>Erskin got his place of Captain of the guard ; and was
</p>
<p>made Viscount Fenton, Earl of Kelly, and K. G.
</p>
<p>Hugh Harris, the surgeon, got a grant of the Barony
</p>
<p>D2
</p>
<p>28
</p>
<p>of Cousland, another of the Earl's estates, and was made
</p>
<p>a Knight, on the day of the trial, November 15.
</p>
<p>George Wilson, James Erskine's servant, " was made
</p>
<p>a Gentleman."
</p>
<p>Leslie, Commendator of Lindores, was created Lord
</p>
<p>Lindores, and appointed a Lord of Justiciary.
</p>
<p>David Murray of Gospetrie, had a donation of the
</p>
<p>Scone estate.
</p>
<p>Murray of Tullibardine got the family castle and barony
</p>
<p>of Ruthven, and the Sheriffship of Perthshire, which was
</p>
<p>heritable in the Ruthven family.
</p>
<p>The Lordship of Strathbraan with its castle of Trochrie,
</p>
<p>was bestowed upon William Stewart, brother of Sir Tho-
</p>
<p>mas Stewart of Grandtully, and Gentleman of the Bed-
</p>
<p>chamber to the King. In a commission, dated November
</p>
<p>16, 1600, the day immediately following the trial and for-
</p>
<p>feiture, Stewart Mas appointed Baillie of Strathbraan, and
</p>
<p>Keeper of King's house of Trochrie, and of the parks and the
</p>
<p>forests of Strathbraan, " for the long, true, and faithfull
</p>
<p>service done to him by the said Sir William, and spending
</p>
<p>his time therein, and for the late service done, being the
</p>
<p>preserving the King's life frae the late conspiracy of um-
</p>
<p>quhile John, Earl of Gowry, upon the fifth of August last."
</p>
<p>In the year 1606, Stewart got a donation of these estates,
</p>
<p>and the above clause is inserted in the Charter.
</p>
<p>Several other parts of Gowry's estate, as Cowgask, Cul-
</p>
<p>trenny, Craigengali, &c. may be recognized in the posses-
</p>
<p>sion of the descendants of some of those who assisted the
</p>
<p>King on this occasion.
</p>
<p>After a lapse of years, the noise excited by the Gowry
</p>
<p>Conspiracy, as usual, gave place, in a good measure, to
</p>
<p>the attention paid more recent occurrences. In particular,
</p>
<p>James' Accession to the Throne of England, which hap-
</p>
<p>pened two or three years afterwards, (1603) being a much

<p>more generally interesting event, had with its concurrent
</p>
<p>circumstances thrown every prior transaction of his life into
</p>
<p>the back-ground, when in 1608 this subject was again very
</p>
<p>unexpectedly brought before the public, and a fresh at-
</p>
<p>tempt made to persuade the world, that Gowry really was
</p>
<p>guilty. An attempt, the remembrance of which, James'
</p>
<p>adherents (for reasons which we can easily divine) would
</p>
<p>willingly consign to oblivion ; but as they made it with the
</p>
<p>view of supporting their cause, they are entitled to every
</p>
<p>29
</p>
<p>advantage which can fairly be drawn from it ; and so are
</p>
<p>their antagonists.
</p>
<p>George Sprott, Notary in Eyemouth, did business for
</p>
<p>Robert Logan of Restalrig, Esq. Logan died in 1602 or
</p>
<p>3. It was given out in the beginning of 1608, that Sprott
</p>
<p>had told an acquaintance, that he knew that Logan was
</p>
<p>confederate with Gowry in the plot against the King, hav-
</p>
<p>ing been so informed by James Bowr, servant to Logan,
</p>
<p>who was employed to carry letters, and negotiate between
</p>
<p>them in that affair, and that in the course of business, hav-
</p>
<p>ing had access to Logan's papers, he (Sprott) found several
</p>
<p>letters among them, which had passed between Logan,
</p>
<p>John Earl of Gowry, Bowr, and a fourth person unknown,
</p>
<p>which letters he had abstracted, and still retained in hifc
</p>
<p>custody. This information was said to have been commu-
</p>
<p>nicated by Sprott's confident, to the Earl of Dunbar, the
</p>
<p>prime-minister or favourite of the day, who laid it before
</p>
<p>the Crown Lawyer: on which Sprott was apprehended,
</p>
<p>and examined before the Privy Council ; but there he de-
</p>
<p>nied all knowledge of any such fact, or that he ever had
</p>
<p>made such a relation to any one. He persisted in this for
</p>
<p>upwards of two months. But at length, being put in the
</p>
<p>boots, his obstinacy or firmness was overcome, and he e-
</p>
<p>mitted a declaration before the Council, in which he con-
</p>
<p>fessed that he was acquainted with Bowr, who told him of
</p>
<p>Gowry's and Logan's treason ; and that he was employed
</p>
<p>in carrying on the correspondence among the conspirators,
</p>
<p>relative to the execution of the plot. He likewise declared,
</p>
<p>that he found the letter to Logan from Gowry, soliciting
</p>
<p>his concurrence in the plot among Logan's papers, and
</p>
<p>Cromarty saj^s, That he actually produced this letter before
</p>
<p>the Privy Council. He told them further, That Logan's
</p>
<p>answer to this letter from the Earl, might be found wrap-
</p>
<p>ped up in a piece of paper in a chest in his (Sprott's) house;

</p>
<p>where the Sheriff found it accordingly, Gowry's letter to
</p>
<p>Logan never was seen, according to all accounts, excepting
</p>
<p>Cromarty's. But the following is a copy of what was said
</p>
<p>to have been found in Sprott's chest as Logan's answer
</p>
<p>to it.
</p>
<p>" My Lord,
</p>
<p>My most humble duty and service hartily
</p>
<p>remembered. At the receit of your Lordship's Letter I
</p>
<p>30
</p>
<p>am so comforted, that I can neither utter my joy nor find
</p>
<p>myself sufficiently able to requite your Lordship with due
</p>
<p>thanks. And pursuade your Lordship in that matter, I
</p>
<p>shall be as forward for your Lordship's honour as if it were
</p>
<p>mine own cause. And I thinke there is no living christian
</p>
<p>that would not be content to revenge the machiavellian
</p>
<p>massacring of our deare friends, yea, howbeit it should be
</p>
<p>to venture and hazzard life, lands, and all other things else.
</p>
<p>My heart can bind me to take part in that matter, as your
</p>
<p>Lordship shall find better proofe thereof. But one thing
</p>
<p>would be done : namely that your Lordship should be cir-
</p>
<p>cumspect and earnest with your Brother, that hee be not
</p>
<p>rash in any speeches touching the purpose of Padua. My
</p>
<p>Lord, you may easily understand that such a purpose as
</p>
<p>your Lordship intendeth cannot be done rashly, but with
</p>
<p>deliberation. And I thinke for myself, that it were most
</p>
<p>meet to have the men your Lordship spoke of ready in a
</p>
<p>boat or bark, and addresse .them as if they were taking pas-
</p>
<p>time on the sea, in such fair summer time. And if your
</p>
<p>Lordship could thinke good either yourself to come to my
</p>
<p>house of Fastcastle by sea, or to send your Brother, I
</p>
<p>should have the place very quiet, and well provided, after
</p>
<p>3 our Lordships advertisement, where we shall have no
</p>
<p>scant of the best venison can be had in England. And no
</p>
<p>others shall have access to haunt the place during your
</p>
<p>Lordship's being here, but all things very quiet. And if
</p>
<p>your Lordship doubt of safe landing, I shall provide all
</p>
<p>such necessaries as may serve for your Lordships arrivall
</p>
<p>within a flight shot of the house. And pursuade your
</p>
<p>Lordship, you shall be as sure and quiet here, while we
</p>
<p>have settled our plot, as if you were in your owne chamber;
</p>
<p>for I trust and am assured, we shall hear word within a few
</p>
<p>days from them your Lordship knoweth off, for I have care
</p>
<p>to see what ships comes home by. Your Lordship know-

</p>
<p>eth I have kept the Lord Bothwell quietly in this house in
</p>
<p>his greatest extremitie, say both king and council what
</p>
<p>they liked ; I hope (if all things come to passe, as I trust
</p>
<p>they shall,) to have both your Lordship and his Lordship
</p>
<p>at one good dinner before I die., Haec jocose, to animate
</p>
<p>your Lordship: I doubt not, My Lord, but all things
</p>
<p>shall be well. And I am resolved whereof your Lordship
</p>
<p>shall not doubt of any thing on my part ; yea, to perill, life,
</p>
<p>land, honour, and goods; yea, the hazzard of hell shall
</p>
<p>31
</p>
<p>not affray me from that, yea, altho* the scaffold were al*
</p>
<p>ready set up : The sooner the matter were done it were the
</p>
<p>better, for the king's buck-hunting' will be shortly; and I
</p>
<p>hope it shall prepare some dantie cheere for us to dine a*
</p>
<p>gainst the next yeare. I remember well, my Lord, and
</p>
<p>will never forget so long as I live, that mirrie sport which
</p>
<p>your Lordship's brother told me of a Nobleman of Padua,
</p>
<p>for I think that a parasceue to this purpose. My Lord
</p>
<p>think nothing that I commit the secrecies hereof, and cre-
</p>
<p>dit to this bearer; for I dare not only venture my life,
</p>
<p>lands, and all other things I have else on his credit, but I
</p>
<p>durst hazzard my soull in his keeping, if it were possible in
</p>
<p>earthly men, for I am so pursuaded of his truth and fidelity ;
</p>
<p>and I trow (as your Lordship may ask him if it be true) he
</p>
<p>would go to hell gates for me ; and hee is not beguiled of
</p>
<p>my part in him. And therefore I doubt not but this will
</p>
<p>pursuade your Lordship to give him trust in this matter as
</p>
<p>to myselfe. But I pray your Lordship direct him home
</p>
<p>with all possable haste, and give him strait command that
</p>
<p>he take not a wincke sleepe while hee see me againe, after
</p>
<p>hee come from your Lordship. And as your Lordship
</p>
<p>desireth in your Letter to me, either rive or burn, or else
</p>
<p>send backe again with the bearer ; for so is the fashion I
</p>
<p>grant."
</p>
<p>Sprott declared further, That James Bowr was sent with
</p>
<p>Logan's letter to Gowry, from whom he returned in five
</p>
<p>days, with " a new letter :" and that he staid all night at
</p>
<p>Guns-green, (a house of Logan's some few miles south from
</p>
<p>Fastcastle) with Logan, who in the morning rode to Lo-
</p>
<p>thain, where he staid five or six days, before he returned
</p>
<p>to Fastcastle. Sprott says further, that he " saw and heard"
</p>
<p>Logan read the Letter, which Bowr brought from Gowry;
</p>
<p>and heard Bowr remonstrate with Logan for taking any
</p>
<p>concern in the conspiracy; but that Logan declared, that

</p>
<p>whatever the consequences might be, he was fixed in his
</p>
<p>determination of hazarding his all with his Lordship.
</p>
<p>Sprott adds that, lie abstracted Logan's Letter to Gowry,
</p>
<p>(which Bowr had brought back from Perth after Gowry
</p>
<p>had perused it) from among a number of other Letters be-
</p>
<p>longing to Logan, but which he had given in keeping to
</p>
<p>Bowr, and which Bowr had given to Sprott to " look over
</p>
<p>and read."
</p>
<p>Sprott being brought to trial, was condemned as an Ac-
</p>
<p>32
</p>
<p>complice in the Treason, because he had not discovered
</p>
<p>it at the proper time, and was sentenced to be hanged at
</p>
<p>Edinburgh on the 12th of August 1608. On the tenth oi
</p>
<p>that month he emitted the following Declaration before the
</p>
<p>Council, which being taken down in writing by the Clerk
</p>
<p>of the Council, it was authenticated by the following wit-
</p>
<p>nesses ; The Earls of Dunbar, and Lothain, the Bishop of
</p>
<p>Ross, the Lords Holyrood-house, Scone, and Blantire,
</p>
<p>Sir William Hart, Lord Justice, Mr John Hall, Mr Pa-
</p>
<p>trick Galloway, and Mr Peter Hewart, Ministers of E-
</p>
<p>dinburgh.
</p>
<p>" George Sprott, Notary in Eyemouth, after divers Ex-
</p>
<p>aminations, being moved with remorse of conscience, for
</p>
<p>the long concealing of the fore-knowledge of this treasona-
</p>
<p>ble conspiracy, confesscth, declareth, and deponeth, with
</p>
<p>the peril of his own life, That he knew perfectly, that Ro -
</p>
<p>bert Logan late of Restalrig, was privy, and upon the fore-
</p>
<p>knowledge of Gowry's treasonable conspiracy. And for
</p>
<p>the greater assurance of his knowledge, deponeth, that he
</p>
<p>knew that there were divers Letters interchanged betwixt
</p>
<p>them, anent the treasonable purpose aforesaid, in the be-
</p>
<p>ginning of the month of July, 1600. Which Letters,
</p>
<p>James Bowr, called Laird Bowr, Servitor to Restalrig
</p>
<p>(who was employed mediator betwixt them, and privy to
</p>
<p>all that errand) had in keeping, and shewed the same to
</p>
<p>Sprott, in the place of Fastcastle.
</p>
<p>" And producing the Earl of Gowry's Letter to Restalrig*."
</p>
<p>The declaration as related by Cromarty continues, " Which
</p>
<p>Letter, written every word with Restalrig's own hand,
</p>
<p>was subscribed by him, after his accustomed manner, Res-
</p>
<p>talrig; and was sent to the Earl of Gowry by the said
</p>
<p>James Bowr. After whose return, within five days, with
</p>
<p>a new letter from Gowrie, he staid all night with Restalrig
</p>
<p>in Gun's Green : And Restalrig rode to Lothain, the morn

</p>
<p>thereafter, where he staid five or six days. Then after his
</p>
<p>returning, past to Fastcastle, where he remained a certain
</p>
<p>short space.
</p>
<p>" And further deponeth, that he saw and heard Restalrig
</p>
<p>read the last letter, which Bowr brought back to him from
</p>
<p>Gowrie, and their conference thereanent. And heard
</p>
<p>Bowr say, " Sir, if you think to make any commodity by
</p>
<p>this dealing, lay your hand to your heart." And Restalrig
</p>
<p>* There seems to be something wanting, or there is some mistake here.
</p>
<p>33
</p>
<p>answered, that he " would doo as he thought best." And
</p>
<p>farther said to Bowr, " Howbeit he should sell all his own
</p>
<p>land that he had in the world, he would pass thro' with
</p>
<p>the Earl of Gowrie; for that matter would give him greater
</p>
<p>contentment, nor if he had the whole kingdom : and rather
</p>
<p>or he should falsify his promise, and recall his vow that he
</p>
<p>had vowed to the Earl of Gowrie, he should spend all that
</p>
<p>he had in the world, and hazard his life with his Lordship."
</p>
<p>To whom Bowr answered, " You may do as you please,
</p>
<p>Sir, but it is not my counsel, that you should be so sudden
</p>
<p>in that matter. But for the condition of Dirlton, I would
</p>
<p>like very well of it." To whom Restalrig answered, " Con-
</p>
<p>tent yourself, I am at my wits end."
</p>
<p>And farther, Sprott deponeth, That he entered himself
</p>
<p>thereafter in conference with Bowr, and demanded what
</p>
<p>was done betwixt the J^aird and the Earl of Gowrie. And
</p>
<p>Bowr answered, " That he believed that the Laird should
</p>
<p>get Dirltoun without either gold or silver, but feared that
</p>
<p>it would be as dear unto him." And Sprott enquiring how
</p>
<p>that could be, Bowr said, " That they had another pye in
</p>
<p>hand nor the selling of land : but prayed Sprott, for God's
</p>
<p>sake, that he would let be, and not trouble himself with
</p>
<p>the Laird's business ; for he feared, within few days, the
</p>
<p>Laird would be landless or lifeless."
</p>
<p>Sprott being reminded, that he had but a short time to
</p>
<p>live ; and questioned if he would go to death with this de-
</p>
<p>position, answered, " That he knew his time to be but short,
</p>
<p>but he had no desire to live, having care of no earthly thing,
</p>
<p>but only for clearing of his conscience in the truth of ail
</p>
<p>these things, to his own shame before the world, and to
</p>
<p>the honour of God, and safety of his own soul : that all the
</p>
<p>former points and circumstances contained in this, his de-
</p>
<p>position, with the deposition made by him on the fifth of
</p>
<p>July last, and the whole remanent depositions made by

</p>
<p>him sen that day are true, which he will take on his con-
</p>
<p>science, and as he hopeth to be saved of God, and that he
</p>
<p>would seal the same with his blood."
</p>
<p>And being questioned, where the letter written by Res-
</p>
<p>talrig to Gowrie, and returned by Bowr now is ; he ans-
</p>
<p>wered, that he abstracted it quietly iroin Bowr, in looking
</p>
<p>over and reading Bowr's letters, which he had in keeping
</p>
<p>of Restal rig's; and that he left the above-written letter in
</p>
<p>his chest among his writings, when he was taken and
</p>
<p>34-
</p>
<p>brought away, and that it is closed and folded in a piece
</p>
<p>pf paper.
</p>
<p>The noblemen and gentlemen, in whose presence this
</p>
<p>was emitted, all signed as witnesses.
</p>
<p>Next day, August the eleventh, he renewed this declara-
</p>
<p>tion before a number of the members of Council, and mi-
</p>
<p>nisters, using a profusion of imprecations on himself if e-
</p>
<p>very particular was not true ; and expressing deep contri^
</p>
<p>tion for the sin of not having divulged the secret sooner.
</p>
<p>On the 12th of August, the day of his execution, he again
</p>
<p>renewed his declaration, drawn up for him by Primrose,
</p>
<p>clerk of the council, from each of the four corners of the
</p>
<p>scaffold. He then prayed, and, at the top of the ladder,
</p>
<p>sung a Psalm, and again ratified his former declaration im-
</p>
<p>mediately before he was turned off.
</p>
<p>And as if all this had not been enough to satisfy every
</p>
<p>reasonable person, Cromarty informs us of another method
</p>
<p>which this suffering penitent took to convince such as Still
</p>
<p>doubted the truth of his dying declaration. His Lordship's
</p>
<p>words are,  " being urged by the Ministers and others of
</p>
<p>good rank upon the scaffold, that now at his end he should
</p>
<p>declare nothing but the truth (touching the matter for which
</p>
<p>he suffered,) on the peril of his salvation, or condemnation
</p>
<p>of his soul : he for the greater assurance of that his constant
</p>
<p>and true deposition, promised (by the assistance of God)
</p>
<p>to give them an open and evident token before the yield-
</p>
<p>ing his spirit. Which he accomplished thereafter. For
</p>
<p>before his last brca tli, when he had hung a pretty space J
</p>
<p>lie lilt up his hands a good height, and clapped them to-
</p>
<p>gether aloud, three several times, to the great wonder and
</p>
<p>admiration of all the beholders, and very soon thereafter,
</p>
<p>he yielded his spirit." The rest of his behaviour, as nar-
</p>
<p>rated above, is attested by a number of respectable witness?
</p>
<p>es, who either were on the scaffold, or in convenient places

<p>near it, amongst whom were three of the Magistrates, and
</p>
<p>several of the Ministers of Edinburgh, the Archbishop of
</p>
<p>Glasgow, the Bishops of Galloway and Brechin, and some
</p>
<p>other gentlemen : but they take no notice of this last men-
</p>
<p>tioned circumstance. Indeed, they may be said to bear tes-
</p>
<p>timony against it, as in their Certificate, they use these
</p>
<p>words. " After the ending thereof," i. e. the Psalm, " he
</p>
<p>repeated and ratified his former deposition. And, with
</p>
<p>35
</p>
<p>that, recommending his soul to God, he was thrown over,-
</p>
<p>and so ended his mortal life."
</p>
<p>Sprott, the only evidence that could have been brought a-
</p>
<p>gainst Logan, being thus taken out of the way, Logan's
</p>
<p>attainder was resolved on, and in February 1609, a sum-
</p>
<p>mons of Treason was raised against all concerned, to sist
</p>
<p>themselves before Parliament, on the 12th of the following
</p>
<p>April. On this occasion the same attention was paid to
</p>
<p>the observance of all the legal forms as at the trial of the
</p>
<p>two brothers. Tho' they knew that Robert Logan of Res-
</p>
<p>talrig had been dead some years, they repeatedly called on
</p>
<p>him to come and sist himself in court. The Messengers
</p>
<p>and their witnesses were sworn, as to their having really
</p>
<p>executed the Summons, and Letters of Relaxation freeing
</p>
<p>Robert Logan, the eldest son of the deceased Restalrig
</p>
<p>from the horn: all which proceedings were engrossed at
</p>
<p>length in the records. The Lord Advocate then produc-
</p>
<p>ed Logan's Letters, which were the only evidence; the de-
</p>
<p>position of the witnesses relative to their authenticity;
</p>
<p>Sprott's declaration, and the record of his trial.
</p>
<p>The following are copies of the Letters said to have
</p>
<p>been written by Logan, and which were the only evidence
</p>
<p>that they ever pretended to possess after Sprott's death, e-
</p>
<p>ven by their own account.
</p>
<p>Right Flonourable Sir, my duty, with service remem-
</p>
<p>bred; please you understand, my Lord of Gowrie and
</p>
<p>some others his Lordship's friends and wel-wishers, who
</p>
<p>tenders his Lordship's preferment, are upon the resolution
</p>
<p>you know, for the revenge of the cause : and his Lordship
</p>
<p>has written to me anent that purpose; whereto I will ac-
</p>
<p>cord in case ye will stand to, and bear a part ; and before
</p>
<p>ye resolve, meet me and Mr Alexander Ruthven in the
</p>
<p>Canongate, on Thursday the next week ; and be as wary
</p>
<p>as ye can : Indeed Mr Alexander Ruthven spoke witli me,

</p>
<p>four or five days since; and I have promised his Lordship
</p>
<p>an answer, within ten days at farthest. As for the purpose,
</p>
<p>how Mr Alexander and I has set down the course, it will
</p>
<p>be a very easy done turn ; and not far by that form, with
</p>
<p>the like stratagem, whereof we had conference in T. S. But
</p>
<p>in case you and Mr Alexander Ruthven forgather, because
</p>
<p>he is somewhat uncautious ; for God's sake bewar with his
</p>
<p>racklessness as to this of Padua ; for he told me one of the
</p>
<p>strangest tales of a nobleman of Padua that ever I heard
</p>
<p>E2
</p>
<p>36
</p>
<p>in my life, resembling the like purpose : I pray you, Sir,
</p>
<p>think nothing, altho' this bearer understand of it ; for he
</p>
<p>is the special secretary of my life ; his name is laird Bowr ;
</p>
<p>and was old Manderston's man, for dead and life, and even
</p>
<p>so now for me. And for my own part, he shall know all,
</p>
<p>that I do in this world, so long as ever we live together ; for
</p>
<p>I make him my household-man : he is well worthy of credit;
</p>
<p>and recommend him to you. Always to the purpose I
</p>
<p>think best, for our plot, that we meet at my house of Fast-
</p>
<p>castle : for, I have concluded with Mr Alexander, who I
</p>
<p>think shall be meetest to be conveyed quietlie in a boat by
</p>
<p>sea; at which time, upon sure advertisement, I shall have
</p>
<p>the place very quiet and well provided ; and as I receive
</p>
<p>your answer, I will post this bearer to my Lord : and I pray
</p>
<p>you, as you love } r our own life, (because it is not a matter of
</p>
<p>mowse,) be circumspect in all things, and take no fear, but
</p>
<p>all shall be well. I have no will that either my brother, or
</p>
<p>yet, M. W. R. my Lord's old pedagogue, know any thing
</p>
<p>of the matter, till all be done, that we would have done ;
</p>
<p>and then I care not who gets wit, that loves us. When ye
</p>
<p>have read, send this my letter back again, with the bearer ;
</p>
<p>that I may see it burnt myself; for so is the fashion, in such
</p>
<p>errands : and if you please, write your answer, on the back
</p>
<p>hereof: in case ye will take my word, for the credit of the
</p>
<p>bearer, and use all expedition ; for the turn would not be
</p>
<p>long delayed. Ye know the King's hunting will be short-
</p>
<p>ly ; and then shall be best time, as Mr Alexander has as-
</p>
<p>sured me, that my Lord has resolved to interprise that mat-
</p>
<p>ter : looking for your answer, commits you to Christ's holy
</p>
<p>protection.

<p>Your's to utter power ready.

</p>
<p>I have received a new letter from my Lord of Gowrie,
</p>
<p>concerning the purpose that Mr Alexander his Lordship's
</p>
<p>brother spoke to me before : and I perceive that I may have
</p>
<p>advantage of Dirltown ; in case his other matter take ef-
</p>
<p>37
</p>
<p>feet ; as we hope it shall. Always I beseech you be at me,
</p>
<p>the morn at even; for I assured his Lordship's servant,
</p>
<p>that I shall send you over the water, within three days with
</p>
<p>a full resolution of all my will, anent all purposes; and I
</p>
<p>shall indeed recommend you and your trustiness to his
</p>
<p>Lordship, as ye shall find an honest recompence, for your
</p>
<p>pains in the end. I care not for all the land I have in this
</p>
<p>kingdom, in case, I can grip of Dirlton ; for I esteem it the
</p>
<p>pleasantest dwelling in Scotland. For God's cause, keep
</p>
<p>all things secret ; that my Lord, my brother, get no know-
</p>
<p>ledge of our purposes ; for I rather be earded quick. And
</p>
<p>so looking for you, I rest till meeting.
</p>
<p>From the Canongate, the 18th day of July.
</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPT.
</p>
<p>I am very ill at ease, therefore, speed you hither :
</p>
<p>Your's to power ready.
</p>
<p>RESTALRIG.
</p>
<p>Right Honourable Sir,
</p>
<p>All my hearty with humble service reniem-
</p>
<p>bred, since I have taken on hand, to interprise with my
</p>
<p>Lord of Gowrie, your special and only best beloved : as
</p>
<p>we have set down the plott already ; I will request you, that
</p>
<p>ye will be very circumspect and wise, that no man get an
</p>
<p>advantage of us. I doubt not, but you know the perill to
</p>
<p>be both life, lands, and honour ; in case the matter be not
</p>
<p>wisely used. And, for my own part, I shall have a special
</p>
<p>respect of my promise, that I made to his Lordship, and
</p>
<p>Mr Alexander, his Lordship's brother ; altho' the scaffold
</p>
<p>were set up. If I cannot come to Falkland the first night,
</p>
<p>I shall be timely in St Johnston on the morn. Indeed I
</p>
<p>lippened for my Lord himself, or else Mr Alexander his
</p>
<p>Lordship's brother, at my house of Fastcastle, as I wrote
</p>
<p>to them both. Always, I repose on your advertisement of
</p>
<p>the precise day, with credit to the bearer : for howbeit, he

<p>be but a sillie glyed old carle, I will answer for him, that
</p>
<p>he shall be very true. I pray you, Sir, read, and either
</p>
<p>burn or send again with the bearer : for, I dare hazard my
</p>
<p>life, and all I have else in the world, on his message, I have
</p>
<p>such proof of his constant truth. So commits you to
</p>
<p>Christ's holy protection.

<p>POSTSCRIPT.
</p>
<p>I use not to write on the back of any of my letters, con-
</p>
<p>cerning this errand.
</p>
<p>Your's to all power, with humble service ready,
</p>
<p>RESTALRIG,
</p>
<p>My Lord,
</p>
<p>My most humble duty with service, in the
</p>
<p>most hearty manner remembred; At the receipt of your
</p>
<p>Lordship's letter, I am so comforted; especially, at your
</p>
<p>Lordship's purpose communicated to me therein; that I
</p>
<p>can neither utter my joy, nor find myself able how to en-
</p>
<p>counter your Lordship with due thanks. Indeed, my
</p>
<p>Lord, at my being last in the town, Mr Alexander, your
</p>
<p>Lordship's brother, imparted somewhat of your Lordship's
</p>
<p>intention, anent that matter, unto me. And, if I had not
</p>
<p>been busied about some turns of my own, I thought to have
</p>
<p>come over to St Johnston and spoke with your Lordship.
</p>
<p>Yet always, my Lord, I beseech your Lordship, both for
</p>
<p>the safety of your honour, credit; and more than that, that
</p>
<p>vour life, my life, and the lives of many others, wh6 may.
</p>
<p>perhaps, innocently smart for that turn afterwards, in case
</p>
<p>it be revealed by any; and likewise the utter wraking of
</p>
<p>our lands and houses, and extirpating of our name; look
</p>
<p>that we be all as sure as your Lordship, and I myself shaii
</p>
<p>be, for my own part. And then, I doubt not, but with
</p>
<p>God's grace, we shall bring our matter to an fine, which
</p>
<p>shall bring the contentment to us all, that ever wished for
</p>
<p>the revenge of Maehivellian massacring of our dearest
</p>
<p>fri cutis. I doubt not, but Mr Alexander, your Lordship's
</p>
<p>brother, has informed your Lordship what course I laid
</p>
<p>down, to bring all our co-associates, to my house of Fast-
</p>
<p>castle by sea ; where, I should have all materials in readi-
</p>
<p>ness, for their sale receiving on land and into my house:'
</p>
<p>making as it were, but a manner of passing time in an boat

</p>
<p>on the sea, in this fair summer-tide; and no other strangers
</p>
<p>to haunt my house, while we had concluded on the laying
</p>
<p>our plot; which is already devised by Mr Alexander and
</p>
<p>me. And I would wish, that your Lordship would either
</p>
<p>come, or send Mr Alexander to me; and thereafter, I
</p>
<p>would meet your Lordship in Leith, or quietly at Restalrig;
</p>
<p>where we shall have prepared an fine hatted kit, with sug-
</p>
<p>gar and comfiits and wine; and thereafter confer on mat-
</p>
<p>39
</p>
<p>tors; and the sooner we brought our purpose to pass, it
</p>
<p>were the better, before harvest. Let not Mr W. R. your
</p>
<p>old pedagogue ken of your coining: but father would I, if
</p>
<p>I durst be so bold to entreat your Lordship, once to come
</p>
<p>and see my own house, where I have keeped my Lord Both-
</p>
<p>well in his greatest extremities; say the King and his Coun-
</p>
<p>cil what they would : and in case God grant us happy suc-
</p>
<p>cess in this errand, I hope both to have your Lordship, and
</p>
<p>his Lordship, with many others of your lovers and his, at
</p>
<p>a good dinner before I die. Always I hope, that the
</p>
<p>King's Buck-hunting at Falkland this year, shall prepare
</p>
<p>some dainty chear for us, against that dinner, the next
</p>
<p>year, jocose hoc to animate your Lordship, at this time :
</p>
<p>but afterwards, we will have better occasion to make merry.
</p>
<p>I protest, my Lord, before God, I wish nothing with a
</p>
<p>better heart nor to atchieve to that which your Lordship
</p>
<p>would fain attain unto; and my continual prayer shall tend
</p>
<p>to that effect; and with the large spending of my lands,
</p>
<p>goods, yea, the hazarding of my life, shall not afray me
</p>
<p>from that, altho' the scaffold were already set up, before I
</p>
<p>should falsify my promise to your Lordship, and pursuade
</p>
<p>your Lordship thereof, I trow, your Lordship has a proof
</p>
<p>of my constancie already or now : but, my Lord, whereas
</p>
<p>your Lordship desires, in your letter, that I crave my Lord,
</p>
<p>my brother's mind anent this matter, I utterly disassent
</p>
<p>from that, that he ever should be an counsellour thereto ;
</p>
<p>for in good faith, he will never help his friend, nor hurt
</p>
<p>his foe. Your Lordship may confide more, in this old man,
</p>
<p>the bearer hereof, my man, Laird Bowr, than in my bro-
</p>
<p>ther ; for I lippen my life and all that I have else in his
</p>
<p>hands: and I trow, he would not spare to ride to hell's gate
</p>
<p>to pleasure me ; and he is not beguiled of my part to him.
</p>
<p>Always, my Lord, when your Lordship has read my letter,
</p>
<p>deliver it to the bearer again, that I may see it burnt with

</p>
<p>mine own eyes: as I have sent your Lordship's letter to your
</p>
<p>Lordship again, for so is the fashion I grant : and I pray
</p>
<p>your Lordship to rest fully pursuaded of me, and all that I
</p>
<p>have promised ; for I am resolved, howbeit, it were to die
</p>
<p>the morn, I must intreat your Lordship to expede Bowr,
</p>
<p>and give him strait directions, upon pain of his life, that
</p>
<p>he take never a wink of sleep, untill he see me again ; or
</p>
<p>else he will utterly undo us. I have already sent another
</p>
<p>letter to the gentleman, your Lordship knows, as the bearer
</p>
<p>40
</p>
<p>will shew your Lordship, of his answer and forwardness
</p>
<p>with your Lordship, and I shall shew your Lordship far-
</p>
<p>ther at meeting, when and where your Lordship shall think
</p>
<p>it meetest. Till which time, and ever, I commit your
</p>
<p>Lordship to the protection of Almighty God.
</p>
<p>From GurCs-Green, the 29th day of July, 1600.
</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPT.
</p>
<p>Prays your Lordship hold me excused for my unseemly
</p>
<p>letter ; which is not so well written, as mister were ; for I
</p>
<p>durst not let any writers ken of it ; but took two sundry
</p>
<p>idle days, to do it myself. I will never forget the good
</p>
<p>sport that Mr Alexander, your Lordship's brother, told me
</p>
<p>of a nobleman of Padua. It comes so oft to my memory ;
</p>
<p>and indeed it is aparastur to this purpose we have in hand.
</p>
<p>Your Lordship's own sworn and bunden man, to
</p>
<p>obey and serve with effold and ever ready service,
</p>
<p>to his utter power, to his life's end.
</p>
<p>RESTALRIG.
</p>
<p>Right Honourable,
</p>
<p>My hearty duty remembred, ye know,
</p>
<p>I told you at our last meeting in the Canongate, that Mr
</p>
<p>Alexander, my Lord of Gowrie's brother, had spoken with
</p>
<p>me anent the matter of our conclusion, and for my own
</p>
<p>part I shall not be hindmost. And sinsyne, I got a letter
</p>
<p>from his Lordship's self, for that same purpose, and upon
</p>
<p>the receipt thereof, understanding his Lordship's frankness
</p>
<p>and forwardness in it; God knows, if my heart was not
</p>
<p>lifted ten stages. I posted this same bearer to his Lordship,
</p>
<p>to whom you may concredit all your heart in that, as well
</p>
<p>as I : for, and it were in my very soul, I durst make him
</p>
<p>messenger thereof, I have such experience of his truth in
</p>
<p>many other things. He is a silly, old, glyed carle, but
</p>
<p>wonder honest; and as he has reported to me, his Lord-
</p>
<p>ship's own answer, I think all matters shall be concluded

</p>
<p>at my house of Fastcastle ; for I, and Mr Alexander Ruth-
</p>
<p>ven, concluded, that ye should come with him and his
</p>
<p>Lordship, and only another man with you, being but only
</p>
<p>four in company intil one of the great fishing boats, be sea
</p>
<p>to my house, where ye shall land als safely, as on Leith
</p>
<p>shore; and the house against your Lordship's coming to be
</p>
<p>quiet ; and when you are about half a mile from shoar, as
</p>
<p>41
</p>
<p>it were passing by the house, to gar set forth a waff. But
</p>
<p>for God's sake, let neither any knowledge come to my Lord,
</p>
<p>my brother's ears, nor yet to Mr W. R. my Lord's old pe-
</p>
<p>dagogue ; for my brother is kittle to shoe behind, and dare
</p>
<p>not enterprise for fear, and the other will disswade us from
</p>
<p>our purpose with reasons of religion, which I can never a-
</p>
<p>bide. I think, there is none of a noble heart, or carries a
</p>
<p>stomach worth a penny, but they would be content, and
</p>
<p>glad, to see any contented revenge of Greysteil's death; and
</p>
<p>the sooner the better his Lordship be quick ; and bid Mr
</p>
<p>Alexander remember on the sport he told me of Padua: for
</p>
<p>I think with myself, that the cogitation on that, should sti-
</p>
<p>mulate your Lordship. And, for God's cause, use all your
</p>
<p>courses cum discretione. Fail not, Sir, to send back this
</p>
<p>letter; for Mr Alexander learned me that fashion, that I
</p>
<p>may see it destroyed myself. So, till your coming, ever
</p>
<p>commits you heartily to Christ's holy protection.
</p>
<p>From Gun's-Gree?i, the last day of July, 1600.
</p>
<p>The Subscription is torn from this last Letter.
</p>
<p>The following is the Deposition of the Witnesses.
</p>
<p>Mr Alexander Watson, Minister at Coldingham, of the
</p>
<p>age of fifty years, married, depones, The five missive let-
</p>
<p>ters subscribed by the Laird of Restalrig, and produced in
</p>
<p>process by the Lord Advocate, for proving of the reasons
</p>
<p>of treason pursued against Robert Logan, son and appa-
</p>
<p>rent heir to Robert Logan of Restalrig, being shewn to this
</p>
<p>deponent ; and he having at length sighted and considered
</p>
<p>the same, depones, That he takes upon his conscience, that
</p>
<p>he verily believes, that the saids five missive letters, and e-
</p>
<p>very one of them, are verily and truly written by the said
</p>
<p>umquhile Robert Logan of Restalrig, with his own hand ;
</p>
<p>and proves this of some of his knowledge, that not only he
</p>
<p>thinks, that the character of every letter resembles perfectly
</p>
<p>the said umquhile Robert's hand-writ every way ; but also

</p>
<p>agrees with his fashion of spelling, which he has particu-
</p>
<p>larly remembrcd in every one of the saids missive letters, in
</p>
<p>their points following. First, that he never used to write
</p>
<p>an z in the beginning of any word, such as, zou, zor's, zeld,
</p>
<p>zea, and sick like ; but ever writ, j/, instead of the said z.
</p>
<p>That he writ all words beginning with w, when single, v ;
</p>
<p>and when that letter w fell to be in the midst or end, he
</p>
<p>[writ] an double iv. That when he writ quhan, quhair, qlk,
</p>
<p>F
</p>
<p>42
</p>
<p>or any such words, whilk uses to be written and spelled by
</p>
<p>others, with which he wrote only qk, qken, qkair. And
</p>
<p>sick like, whenever a word began with con, he never wrote
</p>
<p>con at length, but wrote with an 17. Whenever t fell to be
</p>
<p>in the end of a word, he wrote it without a stroke thro' t,
</p>
<p>and did the like whenever it fell in any other part of a word.
</p>
<p>And for further confirmation of the premisses, he produced
</p>
<p>three letters written every word, and subscribed by the
</p>
<p>said umquhile Robert Logan of Restalrig, and comparing
</p>
<p>them to the five other missives produced by the Advocate,
</p>
<p>shew evidently the direct conformity of the samen, as well
</p>
<p>in the charracter and true resemblance of the hand-writ, as
</p>
<p>in the spelling and writing of diverse writs, syllables, and
</p>
<p>letters, according to the particulars above specified.
</p>
<p>Mr ALEXANDER WATSON.
</p>
<p>Mr Alexander Smith, Minister at Chirneside, of the
</p>
<p>age of thirty years or thereby, married, depones, That he
</p>
<p>was well acquainted with the umquhile Laird of Restalrig,
</p>
<p>by reason he was pedagogue to his bairns, and has seen
</p>
<p>very many of his hand-writs ; and having seen, read, and
</p>
<p>at length considered the five missive letters produced by the
</p>
<p>Advocate ; and inquired, If he knew the same to be the
</p>
<p>Laird of Restalrig' s proper hand-writ? Declared upon his
</p>
<p>great oath, That he certainly believes the saids five letters,
</p>
<p>and every word thereof, to be the Laird of Restalrig's pro-
</p>
<p>per hand-writ; because he finds the character thereof to a-
</p>
<p>gree every way with the shape of his ordinary writting; and
</p>
<p>remarked very particularly the manner of Restalrig's spell-
</p>
<p>ing of many words, otherwise nor other men commonly
</p>
<p>uses to write and spell, according to the hail particulars re-
</p>
<p>marked of before, by Mr Alexander Watson, the witness
</p>
<p>immediately preceding; and, in these points, and in all o~
</p>
<p>thers, conform to the said Mr Alexander's deposition in all
</p>
<p>things. Reddens causam scientice, Because he was perfect-

<p>ly acquainted with the Laird of Restalrig's hand-writ in his
</p>
<p>lifetime : and was pedagogue to his bairns many years, and
</p>
<p>in his companv.
</p>
<p>Mr ALEXANDER SMITH.
</p>
<p>Sir John Arnot, Provost of Edinburgh, of the age of
</p>
<p>three-score ten years, or thereby, married, depones, That
</p>
<p>he was well acquainted with Robert Logan of Restalrig,
</p>
<p>43
</p>
<p>and with his hand-writ, because he had received divers of
</p>
<p>his letters himself, and seen many other letters written by
</p>
<p>him. And the five missive letters produced by the Advo-
</p>
<p>cate, being shewn to him ; and he having seen and consi-
</p>
<p>dered the same, remembred that he had seen, read, and
</p>
<p>perfectly considered the Laird of Restalrig's hand-writ, as
</p>
<p>the letters written by the deponent at any time, or his own
</p>
<p>hand-writ. And so takes on his conscience, That the fore-
</p>
<p>saids five missive bills, produced by the Advocate, are the
</p>
<p>proper hand-writ and subscription of the said umquhile
</p>
<p>Laird of Restalrig, be his judgement. And, for verifica-
</p>
<p>tion thereof, has produced four writs, all written be the
</p>
<p>said umquhile Laird of Restalrig, and sent to this deponent,
</p>
<p>to Archibald Johnstoun, agreeing perfectly in spelling and
</p>
<p>charracter, with the saids missives.
</p>
<p>Sir JOHN ARNOT.
</p>
<p>Alexander Cuik, Sher riff- Clerk of Berwick, of the age
</p>
<p>of fifty years, or thereby, married, depones, That he was
</p>
<p>w r ell acquainted with the umquhile Laird of Restalrig, and
</p>
<p>has seen many and sundry of his writs, and received divers
</p>
<p>of his letters directed to himself; and being desired to see
</p>
<p>the five letters produced by the Advocate, and io declare
</p>
<p>whether he knew and esteemed to be all written by um-
</p>
<p>quhile the Laird of Restalrig, Depones, upon his consci-
</p>
<p>ence, That he believes and esteems the saids hail letters, to
</p>
<p>be all written by the Laird of Restalrig, reddens causam
</p>
<p>scienticC; because, not only the charracter agrees every way
</p>
<p>with the shape of Restalrig's hand-writ ; but also the spell-
</p>
<p>ing in many particulars, wherein Restalrig differed from o-
</p>
<p>ther men's form of writting. And in the particulars there-
</p>
<p>of, depones conform to the two first witnesses, the Ministers
</p>
<p>of Coldingham and Chirneside. Reddens eandem causam

<p>ted the foresaid crime of treason, and lese Majesty ; and

<p>that he was art and part guilty and partaker thereof, against
</p>
<p>our Sovereign Lord, and authority royal; and that the
</p>
<p>fbresaides cruel, wicked, and treasonable crimes, were inr
</p>
<p>terprised, by his causing, persuasion, counsel, and help.
</p>
<p>Likeas, the said umquhil Robert Logan of Redtalrig, trea-

</p>
<p>sonable counselled the foresaid crime of lese Majesty to his
</p>
<p>death, and in his death, in all manner, at length contain-
</p>
<p>ed, in the said summons : and therefore, depones and de-
</p>
<p>clares, the name, memory, and dignity, of the said urn*.
</p>
<p>quhil Robert Logan of Restalrig, to be extinct and abo-
</p>
<p>lished, and his arms cancelled, riven, and delete furth of
</p>
<p>the books of arms, and nobility ; so that his posterity shall
</p>
<p>be excluded, and be unhabile, to possess or enjoy, any of-
</p>
<p>fices, honours, dignities, lands, tenements, rooms, rents,
</p>
<p>46
</p>
<p>possessions, or goods, moveable, or immoveable, rights and
</p>
<p>others whatsomever, within the kingdom, in all times com-

<p>and other goods, moveable and unmoveable, rights and
</p>
<p>others whatsomever partaining to the said umquhil Robert
</p>
<p>Logan of Restalrig ; or which otherways might have par-

<p>tamed to him, at any time, since his conspiring of the said
</p>
<p>treasonable crimes, to be escheat, and fore-faulted to our
</p>
<p>Sovereign Lord ; to appertain and remain perpetually with
</p>
<p>his Majesty in property. And this I give for doom.
</p>
<p>These are the principal circumstances connected with

<p>what is termed Gowry's Conspiracy. There are a number

<p>of others, generally of a minute nature, purposely ommit-

</p>
<p>gainst his royal Majestie, depones, that he neither heard
</p>
<p>nor saw, any appearance of any such intention in the sayde
</p>
<p>Earle.
</p>
<p>Demanded, if he was in any purpose with the sayde
</p>

</p>
<p>their being in Strabran, some of their company found an
</p>
<p>edder, which being killed, and knowledge thereof coming
</p>
<p>to the Earle, the Earle sayde to this deponer, Bogie, if the
</p>
<p>edder had not been slaine, yee should have seen a good
</p>
<p>sport; for I should have caused her stand still, and she
</p>
<p>47
</p>
<p>should have pressed away, by pronouncing of an Hebrew
</p>
<p>word, which in Scotish is called Holiness, but the Hebrew
</p>
<p>word, the deponer remembers not off; and that the Earle
</p>
<p>sayde, he had put the same in practice oft before.
</p>
<p>And this deponer enquiring of the Earle where he got
</p>
<p>the Hebrew word, the Earle answered, in a Cabbalist of
</p>
<p>the Jews, and that it was by tradition : and the deponer en-
</p>
<p>quiring what a Cabbalist meaned ; the Earle answered, it
</p>
<p>was some words which the Jews had by tradition, which
</p>
<p>words were spoken by God to Adam in Paradise, and there-
</p>
<p>fore were of greater efficacy and force than any words which
</p>
<p>were excogitate since by Prophets and Apostles. The de-
</p>
<p>poner enquiring if there were no more requisite but the
</p>
<p>word : the Earle answered, that a firme faith in God was
</p>
<p>requisite and necessary; and that this was no matter of
</p>
<p>marvel among schollers, but that all these things were na-
</p>
<p>tural. And that the Earle shewed to this deponer, that he
</p>
<p>had spoken with a man in Italy, and first bearing by re-
</p>
<p>port, that he was a Nigromancer, and thereafter being in-
</p>
<p>formed that he was a very learned man, and a deep Theo-
</p>
<p>logian, he entered in further dealing with him anent the
</p>
<p>curiositie of nature.
</p>
<p>Depones further, that the sayde Earle reported to him
</p>
<p>that he being at musick, he fell in company with another
</p>
<p>man, who staring in the Earle's face, spake to the rest of
</p>
<p>the company, things of him, which he could never attaine
</p>
<p>unto, nor be worthy off. And therefore that the Earle re-
</p>
<p>proached him, and desired him to forbear these speeches.
</p>
<p>And that he met againe with the same man in the like com-
</p>
<p>pany, who did begin with the same language, that lie had
</p>
<p>spoken before ; and that the Earle sayde to him, my friend,
</p>
<p>in case you will not hold your peace from speaking lies of
</p>
<p>mo, I will make you hold your peace, by speaking truth
</p>
<p>of you ; and said unto him, within such a space, he should

</p>
<p>be hanged for such a crime ; and so it came to passe. This
</p>
<p>deponer enquiring of the Earle, who told him that, he an-
</p>
<p>swered merrilie, that he spake it by guesse, and it fell out
</p>
<p>so. And that the Earle sayde further, that it was nothing
</p>
<p>to make an hcrbe fleshe which would dissolve into flies, and
</p>
<p>likewise it was possable that the seede of man and woman
</p>
<p>might be brought to perfection otherwise than by the ma-
</p>
<p>trix of the woman, and that this deponer counselled the
</p>
<p>Earle to beware with whom he did communicate such
</p>
<p>48
</p>
<p>speeches; who answered, that he would speak them to none",
</p>
<p>but to great schollers, and that he w r ould not have spoken
</p>
<p>them to this deponer, if he had not known him to be a
</p>
<p>favourer of him, and a friend of his house, and would not
</p>
<p>reveale the same againe, seeing he knew they would be evil
</p>
<p>interpreted among the common sorte.

<p>(L. S.) JAMES WEEMYSS of Bogie.
</p>
<p>Apud Falkland 20th August, 1600.
</p>
<p>In presence of the Lordes Chancellour, Treasurer, Ad--
</p>
<p>vocate, Sir George Home of Spot, Sir Robert Mei-
</p>
<p>vil, and Sir James Melvil Knights,.
</p>
<p>Maister William Rynd, sworn and examined, and de-
</p>
<p>manded where he did first see the characters which were
</p>
<p>found upon my Lord : depones, that he having remained a
</p>
<p>space in Venice, at his returning to Padua, did find in
</p>
<p>my Lord's pocket the characters which were found uppon
</p>
<p>him at his death : and the deponer enquiring of my Lord,
</p>
<p>where he had gotten them, my Lord answered, that by
</p>
<p>chance he had copied them himself: and that the deponer
</p>
<p>knows that the characters in Latine, are my Lord's owne
</p>
<p>hand w r riting : but he knows not if the Hebrew characters
</p>
<p>were written by my Lord. Depones further, that when
</p>
<p>my Lord would change his cloaths, the deponer would take
</p>
<p>the characters out of my Lord's pocket, and would say to
</p>
<p>my Lord, Wherefore serve these? and my Lord would
</p>
<p>answer, Can ye not let them be? they do you no evil. And
</p>
<p>further, the deponer declares, that sometimes my Lord
</p>
<p>would forget them, untill he were out of his chamber, and
</p>
<p>would turn backe, as he were in anger, untill he had found
</p>
<p>them, and put them in his own pocket : depones further,
</p>
<p>that he was sundry tymes purposed to have burnt the cha-
</p>
<p>racters, were it not that he feared my Lord's wrath and
</p>
<p>anger; seeing when the deponer would purposely leavo
</p>
<p>them sometimes out of my Lord's pocket, my Lord would

</p>
<p>be in such an anger with the deponer, that for a certayne
</p>
<p>space he would not speake with hym, nor could not finde
</p>
<p>his good countenance. And that (to this deponer's opinion)
</p>
<p>my Lorde would never be content to want the characters off
</p>
<p>himself, from the first time that the deponer sawe them in
</p>
<p>Padua, to the houre of my Lord's death.
</p>
<p>Being demanded for what cause my Lord kept the char-
</p>
<p>racters so well, depones, that, to his opinion it was for no
</p>
<p>49
</p>
<p>good, because lie heard, that in these parts where my Lord
</p>
<p>was, they would give sundry folks breeves.
</p>
<p>Depones further, that Maister Patrick Galloway lett thig
</p>
<p>deponer see the charracters since hee came to the towne of
</p>
<p>Falkland, and that he knowes them to be the very sarae char-
</p>
<p>racters that my Lord had. Depones also, that on Munday
</p>
<p>the fourth of August, the Maister, Andrew Henderson,
</p>
<p>and the deponer remained in my Lord's chamber till about
</p>
<p>ten houres at even, and after a long conference betwixt my
</p>
<p>Lord and the Maister, my Lord called for Andrew Hen-*
</p>
<p>derson, and after some speeches with him, dismissed him.
</p>
<p>Denies that he knew of the Maister's or Andrew Hender-
</p>
<p>son's rideing to Falkland, and about Andrew's return from
</p>
<p>Falkland, uppon the morrow, howbeit he did see him
</p>
<p>booted, yet he knew not that he was come from Falkland*
</p>
<p>Depones, that my Lord being at dinner when the Maister
</p>
<p>came in, the deponer heard my Lord say to the Maister,
</p>
<p>Is the King in the Inche, and with that he did rise and
</p>
<p>sayde, Let us go. But the deponer knows not what the
</p>
<p>Maister sayde to my Lord.
</p>
<p>Being demanded, if he did see any kind of armour or
</p>
<p>weapons, except swords in the King's company; depones,
</p>
<p>that he did see none.
</p>
<p>It being demanded, how the deponer was satisfied with
</p>
<p>my Lord's answer to him, concerning the King's coming to
</p>
<p>Saint Johnstoun, saying, that he " knew not how he came,"
</p>
<p>declares, that he thought that my Lord had dissembled
</p>
<p>with him, and that he behooved to have knowne it, seeing
</p>
<p>his Brother was come with his Majestie before that he de-
</p>
<p>manded of him, and that hee had conferred with my Lord
</p>
<p>privily.
</p>
<p>Depones, that he knew not that the Maister was ridden
</p>
<p>to Falkland, untill after His Majes tie's coming to Saint
</p>
<p>Johnstoun, that Andrew Ruthven told him, because the

</p>
<p>Deponer enquired of Andrew Ruthven where the Maister
</p>
<p>and he had becne, and that Andrew answered, that they
</p>
<p>had been at Falkland : and that the Maister having spoken
</p>
<p>with the King, His Majestie came forward with them : and
</p>
<p>that this conference betwixt the deponer and Andrew Ruth-
</p>
<p>ven was in the yard, when my Lord was there. And An-
</p>
<p>drew Ruthven shewed the deponer, that Andrew Hender-
</p>
<p>son was directed by the Maister to shew my Lord that his
</p>
<p>Majestie was comming.
</p>
<p>G
</p>
<p>50
</p>
<p>Depones also 9 that in his opinion, the Maister coulde
</p>
<p>not have drawne the King to my Lord's house, without my
</p>
<p>Lord's knowledge : and that, when he heard the tumult, he
</p>
<p>was resolved in his heart the Maister had done his Majes-
</p>
<p>tie wrong ; and that no true Christian can think otherwise,
</p>
<p>but that it was an high treason, attempted against his High-
</p>
<p>nesse by the Maister and the Lord,
</p>
<p>Depones also, that to his opinion, the King's whole com-
</p>
<p>pany was within a dozen of men.

<p>(L. S.) M. W. RYND.
</p>
<p>Apud Falkland, 20th August, 1600.
</p>
<p>In presence of the Lordes Chancellor, Treasurer, Ad-
</p>
<p>vocate, Controller, Sir George Home of Spot, and
</p>
<p>Sir James Melvil, Knights.
</p>
<p>Andrew Henderson sworn and examined, and demand-
</p>
<p>ed, what purpose was betwixt him and the Earle of Gow-
</p>
<p>rye, upon Munday at night, the fourth of this instant, in
</p>
<p>the sayde Earle' s chamber: depones, that the Earle inquired
</p>
<p>of him, what hee would be doing upon the morne ? and he
</p>
<p>answered, that he was to ride to Ruthven : The Earle said
</p>
<p>to him, You must ride to Falkland with Maister Alexander
</p>
<p>my Brother, and when hee directs you backe, see that ye
</p>
<p>returne with all diligence, if he send a letter or any other
</p>
<p>advertisement with you.
</p>
<p>Depones, that the Maister directed him to send for An-
</p>
<p>drew Ruthven to be in readinesse to ride with them the
</p>
<p>morrow at four houres in the morning.
</p>
<p>Declares that they coming to Falkland about seven houres
</p>
<p>in the morning, the Maister stayed in a lodging beside the
</p>
<p>palace, and directed the deponer to see what the King was
</p>
<p>doing ; and the deponer finding his Majestie in the close
</p>
<p>coming forth, he past backe, and told the Maister, who
</p>
<p>immediately addressed himselfe to his Highnesse, and spake
</p>
<p>with his Majestie a good space beneth the equirie : and af-

</p>
<p>ter his Majestie was on horse backe, the Maister cometh to
</p>
<p>the deponer, and commands him to fetch their horses, and
</p>
<p>bade him haste him, as he loved my Lord's honour and his,
</p>
<p>and advertise my Lord, that his Majestie and he would be
</p>
<p>there incontinent, and that his Majestie would be quiet :
</p>
<p>And the deponer inquiring of the Maister, if he should goe
</p>
<p>presently, he did bid him leap on and follow him, and not
</p>
<p>goe away untill he spoke with the King: and the Maister
</p>
<p>51
</p>
<p>having spoke with the King at a breache of the park-wall,
</p>
<p>he turned backe, and bade the deponer ride away ; and the
</p>
<p>deponer making his return in all possible haste to Saint
</p>
<p>Johnstoun, he found my Lord in his chamber about ten
</p>
<p>houres, who left the company he was speaking with, and
</p>
<p>came to the deponer, and asked, hath my brother sent a
</p>
<p>letter with you? The deponer answered, No: but they
</p>
<p>will be all here incontinent, and bade the deponer desire
</p>
<p>my Lord to cause prepare the dinner. Immediately there*
</p>
<p>after, my Lord took the deponer to the cabinet, and asked
</p>
<p>him, how His Majestie took with the Maister his brother ?
</p>
<p>The deponer answered, very well, and that His Majestie
</p>
<p>laid his hand over the Maister's shoulder. Thereafter my
</p>
<p>Lord inquired, if there were many at the hunting with the
</p>
<p>King ? The deponer answered, that he took no heede, but
</p>
<p>they who were accustomed to ride with His Majestie, and
</p>
<p>some Englishmen were there, and that my Lord inquired
</p>
<p>what special men were with His Majestie, and that the de-
</p>
<p>poner answered, he did see none, but my Lord Duke.
</p>
<p>And within an houre thereafter, when the deponer came in.
</p>
<p>from his owne house, the Earle bad him put on his secret
</p>
<p>and plaitte-sleeves, for he had an Hylandman to take;
</p>
<p>which the deponer did incontinent: and about twelve
</p>
<p>houres, when the deponer was going out to his own house
</p>
<p>to his dinner, the Stewart came to him and told him, that
</p>
<p>George Craigengelt was not well, and was laine downe, de-
</p>
<p>sired him to tarry and take up my Lord's dinner : and a-
</p>
<p>bout half an hour after twelve, my Lord commanded him
</p>
<p>to take up the first service. And when the deponer was
</p>
<p>commanded to take up the second service, the Maister and
</p>
<p>William Blair came into the hall to my Lord.
</p>
<p>The deponer remembreth himselfe, that Andrew Ruth-
</p>
<p>ven came before the Maister a certain space, and spake
</p>
<p>with my Lord quietlie at the table, but heard not the par-

</p>
<p>ticular purpose that was amongst them. And so soon as
</p>
<p>the Maister came to the hall, my Lord and the whole com-
</p>
<p>pany rose from the table; and the deponer hearing the
</p>
<p>noyse of their forthgoing, supposing they were going to
</p>
<p>make breeks for Maconilduy : and seeing my Lord pass to
</p>
<p>the Inche and not to the Snoegate, the deponent did cast
</p>
<p>the gantlet in the pantry, and caused his boy to take his
</p>
<p>Steele bonnet to his own house : and he followed my Lord
</p>
<p>to the Inche, and returned backe with His Majestie to the
</p>
<p>G2
</p>
<p>52
</p>
<p>lodging, being directed to get drink. And the Maister
</p>
<p>came to the deponer, and did bid him cause Maister Wil-
</p>
<p>liam Rynd to send him up the keye of the gallery chamber;
</p>
<p>who past up and delivered the key to the Maister : and im-
</p>
<p>mediately my Lord followed up, and did speake with the
</p>
<p>Maister, and came downe againe, and directed Mr Thomas
</p>
<p>Cranstone to the deponer, to come to his Lordship in His
</p>
<p>Majestie's chamber. And that my Lord directed him to
</p>
<p>go up to the gallerie to his brother ; and immediately my
</p>
<p>Lorde followed up, and commanded the deponer to bide
</p>
<p>there with his brother, and to do any thing that he bade
</p>
<p>him : the deponer inquired at the Maister, what have ye to
</p>
<p>do, Sir? The Maister answered, Yee must go in here and
</p>
<p>tarry till I come backe, for I will take the key with me.
</p>
<p>So he locked the deponer in the round, within the cham-
</p>
<p>ber, and took the key with him. Shortly thereafter, the
</p>
<p>Maister returned, and the King's Majestic with him, to the
</p>
<p>saide cabinet in the rounde; and the Maister opening the
</p>
<p>doore, entered with the King into the sayde rounde; and
</p>
<p>at his very entrie, covering his head, pulled out the depon-
</p>
<p>er's dagger, and held the same to His Majestie's breast,
</p>
<p>saying, remember ye of my father's murder? Yee shall
</p>
<p>now die for it : and minting to His Highness's heart with
</p>
<p>the dagger, the deponer threw the same out of the Maister's
</p>
<p>hand : and swore that as God shall judge his soul, if the
</p>
<p>JVTaister had retained the dagger in his hand, the space that
</p>
<p>a man may goe six steps, he would have stricken the King
</p>
<p>to the hilts with it: but wanting the dagger, and the King's
</p>
<p>Majestie giving him a gentle answer, he sayde to the King's
</p>
<p>Majestic, with abominable oathes, that, if he would keepe si-
</p>
<p>lence, nothing should aile him, if he would make such pro-
</p>
<p>mise to his brother, as they would crave of him : and the
</p>
<p>King's Majestie inquiring what promise they would crave :
</p>
<p>he answered, that he would bring his brother. So he goes

<p>forth, and lockes the doore of the round uppon His Majestie
</p>
<p>and the deponer ; having first taken oathe of the King that
</p>
<p>he would not crie, nor opene the windowe.
</p>
<p>And His Majestie inquiring of the deponer, What he
</p>
<p>was ? he answered, a servant of my Lorde's, and His Ma-
</p>
<p>jestie asking of the deponer, if my Lord would do any evil
</p>
<p>to him? the deponer answered, As God shall judge my
</p>
<p>soul, I shall die first. And the deponer pressing to have
</p>
<p>opened the window, the Maister entered, and said, Sir,
</p>
<p>53
</p>
<p>there is no remedy, by God you must die : and having a
</p>
<p>loose garter in his hand, pressing to have bound His Ma-
</p>
<p>jestie's hands, and the deponer pulled the garter out of Mr
</p>
<p>Alexander his hands, and then the Maister did put one
</p>
<p>of his hands in His Majestie's mouth, to have stayed him
</p>
<p>to speake, and helde his other arme about His Majestie's
</p>
<p>necke, and that this deponer pulled the Maister's hand from
</p>
<p>His Majestie's mouthe, ,and opened the window; and then
</p>
<p>His Majestie cryed out thereat; whereuppone His High-
</p>
<p>nesse' servants came in at the gate, and this deponer did
</p>
<p>runne and open the doore of the turnpecke head, whereat
</p>
<p>John Ramsay entered: and the deponer stoode in the
</p>
<p>chamber untill he did see John Ramsay give the Maister a
</p>
<p>stroke, and thereafter privily conveyed himself downe the
</p>
<p>turnpecke to his own house: and the deponer's wife inquir-
</p>
<p>ing of him, what the fray meaned ? the deponer answered,
</p>
<p>that the King's Majestie would have been twice sticked had
</p>
<p>not hee relieved him.
</p>
<p>Further, the sayde Andrew Henderson depones, That
</p>
<p>after his returning from Falkland on the fifth of this instant,
</p>
<p>Maister John Moncrieff inquiring of him, where he had
</p>
<p>beene ? he answered, that he had beene beyond the Bridge
</p>
<p>of Earn; and says that he gave that answere to Maister
</p>
<p>John, because my Lord had commanded him to let no man
</p>
<p>know that he was to ride to Falkland : and that my Lord's
</p>
<p>direction to him was, to come backe with his brother Mais-
</p>
<p>ter Alexander's answer : and to leave Andrew Ruthven to
</p>
<p>awaite upon the Maister.
</p>
<p>Further, the sayde Andrew Henderson depones, That,
</p>
<p>when he had taken the Maister's hand out of the King's
</p>
<p>mouth, and was opening the windowe, Maister Alexander
</p>
<p>sayde to him, wilt thou not helpe, woe betide, thou wilt
</p>
<p>makers all die.

</p>
<p>That upon the fifth of August last by-past, this deponent,

<p>jesty, he saw Mr Alexander Ruthven speaking with His
</p>
<p>Grace before the stables, betwixt six and seven in the morn-
</p>
<p>ing; and shortly thereafter, His Majesty passing to the
</p>
<p>hunting of the buck, and having slain one in the park of
</p>
<p>55
</p>
<p>Falkland, His Highness spake to the deponent, disyring
</p>
<p>him to accompany His Majesty to Perth, to speak to the
</p>
<p>Earl of Gowrie. And incontinent thereafter, this depo-
</p>
<p>nent sent his servant for another horse, and for a sword,
</p>
<p>and lap on and followed His Grace : and as this deponent
</p>
<p>overtook His Grace, Mr Alexander Ruthven was speak-
</p>
<p>ing with His Majesty ; and shortly after the deponent's
</p>
<p>coming to the King, His Highness rode apart, and spake
</p>
<p>with this deponent, saying, ye cannot guess, men, what
</p>
<p>errand I am riding for ; I am going to get a pose in Perth :
</p>
<p>and Mr Alexander Ruthven has informed me, that he has
</p>
<p>fund a man, that has a pitchard full of coined gold, of
</p>
<p>great sorts. And in the mean time, His Highness enquir-
</p>
<p>ed of this deponent, of what humour he thought Mr Alex-
</p>
<p>ander to be of? who answered, that he knew nothing of
</p>
<p>him, but as of an honest discreet gentleman, And after that
</p>
<p>His Highness had declared to this deponent, the hail cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances of the man who had the said gold, the place
</p>
<p>where it was found, and where it was kept: this deponent an-
</p>
<p>swered, I like not that, Sir; for it is not likely. And they rid-
</p>
<p>ing beside the bridge of Erne, His Majesty called to the de-
</p>
<p>ponent, that Mr Alexander disyred him to keep that matter
</p>
<p>of the pose secret, and take no body with him; and then His
</p>
<p>Highness both at that time and afterwards at St Johnstoun,
</p>
<p>within the Earl of Gowrie's hall, said to this deponer, Take
</p>
<p>taint where I pass with Mr Alexander Ruthven, and follow me.
</p>
<p>And as His Majesty was within a mile of Pearth, after that
</p>
<p>Mr Alexander had come a certain space with His High-
</p>
<p>ness, he rod away and galloped to Pearth, before the rest
</p>
<p>of the company, towards his brother's lodging; of purpose
</p>
<p>(as the deponent believes,) to advertise the Earl of Gowrie
</p>
<p>of His Majesty's coming there ; and as His Majesty was
</p>
<p>within two pair of butt-iangs to the town of Pearth, the
</p>
<p>Earl of Gowrie, accompanied with diverse persons all on,

</p>
<p>Thomas Erskin, Laird of Urquhil, James Erskin, William
</p>
<p>Stuart, Sir Hugh Haris, Sir John Ramsay, John Murray,
</p>
<p>John Hamilton of the Grange, and John Graham of Ba-

</p>
<p>said Earl of Gowrie, and the said Mr Alexander Ruthven,
</p>
<p>being baith present with them: and after their entry, Hi*
</p>
<p>56
</p>
<p>Majesty cry'd for a drink, which was a long time a con>*
</p>
<p>ing ; and it was an hour after his first coming, before His
</p>
<p>Majesty got his dinner : and in the time that His Majesty
</p>
<p>got his desert, the Earl of Gowrie came to this deponent,
</p>
<p>and to the Earl of Mar, and remanent persons foresaid,
</p>
<p>and desired them to dine, which they did, in the hall ; and
</p>
<p>when they had near hand din'd, the Earl of Gowrie came
</p>
<p>from His Majesty's chamber to the hall, and called for
</p>
<p>wine; and said, that he was directed from his Majesty's
</p>
<p>chamber, to drink his scoll, to My Lord Duke, and the
</p>
<p>rest of the company, which he did. And immediately af-
</p>
<p>ter the scoll had passed about, this deponent raise from the
</p>
<p>table, to have waited upon His Majesty, conform to his
</p>
<p>former direction ; and then the Earl of Gowrie said to this
</p>
<p>deponent, that His Majesty was gone up quietly some quiet
</p>
<p>errand : and then, the said Earl of Gowrie cry'd for the key
</p>
<p>of his garden, and passed in company with this deponent,
</p>
<p>to the garden, accompanied with Lindores, and Sir Hugh
</p>
<p>Herries, and certain others : and shortly after their being
</p>
<p>in the garden, Mr Thomas Cranston came down to the
</p>
<p>garden, crying, The King's Majesty is on horse-back,
</p>
<p>and ridden thro' the Inch: and then the Earl of Gow-
</p>
<p>rie cry'd horse, horse : and the said Mr Thomas Crans-
</p>
<p>ton answered to him, your horse is in town ; to whilk the
</p>
<p>Earl of Gowrie made him no answer, but cry'd ay, horse,
</p>
<p>horse. And this deponent and the Earl of Gowrie came
</p>
<p>first out of the garden, thro' the hall to the closs, and came to
</p>
<p>the oute-gate ; and this deponent speir'd at the porter, if
</p>
<p>the King was furth, who answered, that he was assured
</p>
<p>that His Majesty was not come furth of the place. Then
</p>
<p>the Earl of Gowrie said, I am sure he is first always ; stay,
</p>
<p>My Lord, drink, and I shall gang up, and get the verity and
</p>
<p>certainty thereof: and the said Earl of Gowrie passed up,
</p>
<p>and incontinent came again to the closs, and he affirmed to

</p>
<p>back-gate and away. Whereupon this deponent, the Earl
</p>
<p>of Gowrie and Mar, and hail company, past furth at the
</p>
<p>fore-gate of the lodging ; and staid before the same gate up-
</p>
<p>on the street : and as they were standing there, advising
</p>
<p>where to seek the King, incontinent, and in the meantime,
</p>
<p>this deponent heard a voice, and said to the Earl of Mar,
</p>
<p>This is the King's voice, that crys, be where he will : and
</p>
<p>so they all looked up to the lodging, and saw His Majesty
</p>
<p>5?
</p>
<p>looking furth of the window, wanting his hat : his face be-
</p>
<p>ing red, and an hand gripping his cheek and mouth, and
</p>
<p>the King cryed I am murdered ! treason ! My Lord Mar,
</p>
<p>help, help ! And incontinent, this deponent, the Earl of
</p>
<p>Mar, and their company, ran up the stair of the gallery-
</p>
<p>chamber, where His Majesty was, to have relieved him ;
</p>
<p>and as they passed up, they found the door of the chamber
</p>
<p>fast; and seeing a ladder standing beside, they rasht at
</p>
<p>the door with the ladder and the steps of the ladder brake :
</p>
<p>and syne, they send for hammers; and notwithstanding
</p>
<p>large forcing with hammers, they got not entry at the said
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>given thro' the hole of the door of the chamber, and they
</p>

</p>
<p>first entry, they saw the Earl of Gowrie lying dead in the
</p>
<p>chamber, Mr Alexander Ruthven being slain, and taken
</p>
<p>down the stairs before their entry : and at their first entry
</p>
<p>within that chamber where the King's Majesty was, the de-
</p>
<p>ponent saw sundry halberts and swords stricking under the
</p>
<p>door of the chamber, and sides thereof, by reason the same
</p>

<p>God's sake tell me how my Lord of Gowrie was : to whom

<p>this deponent answered, he is well : and the said deponent
</p>
<p>bad Alexander to gang his way ; and that he was an fool ;
</p>
<p>and that he would get little thanks for that labour : and,

</p>
<p>with ; and when he did his courtesy, the King laid his hand
</p>
<p>upon his shoulder. The Earl speird, What number of
</p>
<p>persons was with the King at the hunting ? Who answered,
</p>
<p>That he knew not well : but that there were sundry of his

<p>but my Lord Duke. And thereafter, this deponent past

<p>Earl saw him in his chamber, he called upon this depor
</p>
<p>nent, and bad him put on his secret* and plate-sleeves :
</p>
<p>the deponent enquired to what effect ? The Earl answered,
</p>
<p>I have an Highlandman to take in the Shoegate ; and then
</p>
<p>the deponent past to his own house, and put on his secret
</p>
<p>and plate-sleeves, came back again to the Earl of Gowrie's
</p>
<p>house : and about half an hour to one, the Earl command-
</p>
<p>ed this deponent, Take up my dinner; and this deponent
</p>
<p>past, and took up the first service, by reason Charles Craig-
</p>
<p>ingelt was sick : and, incontinent, the said Earl passed to
</p>
<p>his dinner, accompanied with Mr John Moncrieff Laird
</p>
<p>of Pitcrief, Mr James Drummono!, Alexander Peebles,
</p>
<p>Baron of Findowne. And shortly after the first service was
</p>
<p>set down, my Lord sitting at the table with the foresaid
</p>
<p>company, Andrew Ruthven came in from the Master, and
</p>
<p>rounded to the Earl, but heard not what he said ; and shorts
</p>
<p>ly after, this deponent passing down to take up the second
</p>
<p>service, Mr Alexander Ruthven and William Blair came
</p>
<p>in to the Earl, my Lord sitting at his dinner ; and how soon
</p>
<p>my Lord saw them, he and his hail company rose from the
</p>
<p>table ; and then, this deponent hearing my Lord on foot,
</p>
<p>bid this deponent send for his steel-bonnet and gantlet, be-
</p>
<p>lieving that my Lord was going to take the said Highland-
</p>
<p>man : and as this deponent perceiv'd my Lord passing to
</p>
<p>the Inch, and not to the Shoegate, he sent home his steel-
</p>
<p>bonnet, and cast his gantlet in the pantry, and thereafter
</p>
<p>followed die Earl to the Inch, where he saw the said Earl

<p>with His Majesty, the Duke, and the Earl of Marr, and

<p>this deponent speak to Mr William Rynd to give him the
</p>
<p>said key. And the Master passing up to the gallery, Mr
</p>
<p>William Rynd followed him, and gave to him the said key :
</p>
<p>and thereafter, immediately after His Majesty's down sit-
</p>
<p>ting to his dinner, Mr Thomas Cranstoun came to this de-
</p>
<p>ponent, and bad him gang to the Earl of Gowrie ; which
</p>
<p>this deponent did. And the Earl of Gowrie, in the outer-
</p>
<p>chamber, where the King din'd, spake to this deponent
</p>
<p>secretly, and bad him pass to the gallery to his brother
</p>
<p>* A Co*t of Mail.
</p>
<p>61
</p>
<p>$o he passed up, and the Earl follows him ; and they being
</p>
<p>all three together in the gallery-chamber, (whereof he had
</p>
<p>the key from Mr William Rynd,) the Earl said to this de-
</p>
<p>ponent, Tarry still with my brother, and do any thing he
</p>
<p>bids you. Then this deponent came to the Master and
</p>
<p>speird, What will you with me, Sir? Then the Mas-
</p>
<p>ter spoke to my Lord, Let Andrew Henryson go into the
</p>
<p>round of the chamber, and I will lock him in, and take,
</p>
<p>the key of the chamber with me : where this deponent a-
</p>
<p>bode half an hour or thereby, locked his allane, having his
</p>
<p>secret, plate-sleeves, sword and whinger with him, and
</p>
<p>wanting his steel bonnet. And all this time, this deponent
</p>
<p>feared some evil to be done : that, upon this, he kneel'd and
</p>
<p>pray'd to God ; and about the end of the half hour, Mr A-
</p>
<p>lexander opens the door of the room, and entered first
</p>
<p>within the same, haying the King's Majesty by the arm,
</p>
<p>and putting on his hat upon his head, draws forth this
</p>
<p>Andrew Henderson deponent's whinger, and says to the
</p>
<p>King, having the drawn whinger in his hand, Sir, you
</p>
<p>must be my prisoner; remember on my Father's death.
</p>
<p>And, as he held the whinger to His Majesty's breast, tins
</p>
<p>deponent threw the samen furth of Mr Alexander's hands.
</p>
<p>And the time that Mr Alexander held the whinger to His
</p>
<p>Majesty's breast, the King was beginning to speak. The
</p>
<p>Master said, Hold your tongue, Sir, or by Christ, ye shall
</p>
<p>die. Then His Majesty answered, Mr Alexander, ye and
</p>
<p>I were very great together : and as touching your Father's
</p>
<p>death, man, I was but a minor. My Council might have
</p>
<p>done any thing they pleased. And farther, man, albeit ye
</p>
<p>bereave me of my life, ye will not be King of Scotland ;
</p>
<p>for, I have both sons and daughters ; and there are men in this
</p>
<p>town and friends that will not leave it unrevenged. Then
</p>
<p>Mr Alexander answered, swearing with a great oath, That
</p>
<p>it was neither his life nor blood that he craved. And the

<p>King said, What traiks albiet ye take off your hat ; and
</p>
<p>then Mr Alexander took off his hat. And the King said,
</p>
<p>What is it ye crave, man, and ye crave not my life ? Who
</p>
<p>answered, Sir, it is but a promise. The King answered,
</p>
<p>What promise ? The said Mr Alexander answered, For,
</p>
<p>my Lord my brother will tell you. The King said, Fetch
</p>
<p>hither your brother. And syne the said Mr Alexander said
</p>
<p>to the King, Sir, you will not cry, nor open the window,
</p>
<p>vhile I come again ? And the King promised so to do.
</p>
<p>62
</p>
<p>Then Mr Alexander passed forth and locked, and passed
</p>
<p>not from the door, as he believes. In the meantime, the
</p>
<p>King entered in discourse with this deponent, How came
</p>
<p>you in here, man ? And this deponent answered, As God
</p>
<p>lives, I am shot in here like a dog. The King answered,
</p>
<p>Will my Lord of Gowrie do me any evil, man? This
</p>
<p>deponent answered, I vow to God, I shall die first. And
</p>
<p>then, the King bad this deponent open the window, and
</p>
<p>he opened the window that looked to the Spey-tower:
</p>
<p>and the King answered, fy, the wrong window, man !
</p>
<p>And thereafter, this deponent passing to the other win-
</p>
<p>dow nearest His Majesty, to open the same; before he
</p>
<p>got to the window, Mr Alexander opened the door, and
</p>
<p>came in again, and said to His Majesty, By God ! there
</p>
<p>is no remedy ; and then he loups to the King, and got him
</p>
<p>by both the hands, having an garter in his hands. Then
</p>
<p>the King answered, I am a free Prince, man ; I will not
</p>
<p>be bound : so His Majesty cast loose his left hand from Mr
</p>
<p>Alexander ; and at the same time, this deponent draws a-
</p>
<p>way the garter from Mr Alexander, and His Majesty loups
</p>
<p>free from the said Mr Alexander, and the said Mr Alex-
</p>
<p>ander follows His Majesty, and with his left hand about
</p>
<p>His Majesty's craig, puts his right neeve in His Majesty's
</p>
<p>mouth. So His Majesty wrestling to be quite of him this
</p>
<p>deponent puts his hand out of His Majesty's mouth. And
</p>
<p>thereafter, this deponent did put his left hand over His
</p>
<p>Majesty's left shoulder, and pulled up the broad of the win-
</p>
<p>dow, whereunto the said Mr Alexander had thrust His
</p>
<p>Majesty's head and shoulders; and with the force of the
</p>
<p>drawing up of the window, presses His Majesty's body a-
</p>
<p>bout, his right side to the window : at which time His Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty cries furth, Treason ! Treason ! So the Master said
</p>
<p>to this deponent. Is there no help with thee ? Wo worth
</p>
<p>thee, thou villain, we all die. So twining his hand on the

</p>
<p>jesty put his hand on the Master's hands and staid him from
</p>
<p>drawing of his sword: and this ways, they both being
</p>
<p>grasped together, comes furth of the cabinet to the cham-
</p>
<p>ber ; and, in the meantime, this deponent threw about the
</p>
<p>key, then standing in the door of the head of the turnpike,
</p>
<p>which entered to the chamber, and opened the door thereof
</p>
<p>to eschew himself, and to let His Majesty's servants in; and
</p>
<p>how soon he opened the door, John Ramsay came in at the
</p>
<p>said door, with an haulk on his hand, and passed to the
</p>
<p>King's Majesty and laid about him, and drew his whinger *
</p>
<p>and as he saw him minting with the whinger, this deponent
</p>
<p>passed furth at the said door, and passed down the turn-
</p>
<p>pike. And as this deponent passed through the close, and
</p>
<p>came to the fore-gate, this deponent saw the Earl of Gowrie
</p>
<p>standing before the gate accompanied by sundry persons,
</p>
<p>of whom he remembers none; but remembers well, that;
</p>
<p>the Earl had this deponent's knapschaw, or head-piece, on
</p>
<p>his head, and two swords drawn in his hands : and incon-
</p>
<p>tinently thereafter, this deponent pass'd to his own lodging,
</p>
<p>where he remained while the King passed furth of the town;
</p>
<p>and then the deponent past to the bridge and walked up
</p>
<p>and down by the space of an hour, and returned not again
</p>
<p>to the Earl's lodging. And the time of his entry to his
</p>
<p>house that night, this deponent's wife inquired at this de-
</p>
<p>ponent, What trouble was within the place? To whom
</p>
<p>he answered, Well is me of one thing, that if I had not
</p>
<p>been there, the King had been twice sticked this night;
</p>
<p>but wo's me for the thing that is fallen out. And this de-
</p>
<p>ponent being demanded by Mr John Moncrief, after his
</p>
<p>returning from Falkland, Where have you been with your
</p>
<p>boots on ? Answered, he had been two or three miles be-
</p>
<p>yond Earn, and durst not tell him the verity, by reason
</p>
<p>the Earl of Gowrie had discharged him to tell the errand,
</p>
<p>he sent him, to any body. And farther, this deponent de-
</p>
<p>clares, That when he saw the Earl of Gowrie standing with
</p>
<p>the drawn swords before the gate, this deponent spoke not
</p>
<p>to the Earl, neither yet the Earl to him at that time, but
</p>
<p>he passed to his own house.

<p>son his own could not be so soon prepar'd. To whom Mr

<p>Alexander answered, He might not tarry, by reason His

<p>Majesty had commanded him to await upon him. And, as
</p>
<p>this deponent passed to Falkland, leaving Mr Alexander

<p>in the Inch, and passed in company with His Majesty, and

<p>said to him, Traitor, this is thy deed. Whilk Earl an-

<p>the deponent heard Sir John Ramsay crying out at the

<p>to the head ! and, as this deponent had passed up five steps
</p>
<p>of the turnpike; he sees and meets with Mr Alexander

<p>Ruthven blooded in two parts of his body, viz, in his face,

<p>by them, and fell; and, as he was fallen, he turned his
</p>
<p>face and cry'd, Alas ! I had not the wyte of it, this depon-
</p>
<p>ent being standing above him in the turnpike. Thereafter,
</p>
<p>this deponent past to the head of the turnpike, and entered
</p>
<p>within the chamber at the head of the gallery, where the
</p>
<p>King and Sir John Ramsay, was there alone present ; and,
</p>
<p>at the first meeting, this deponent said to His Majesty, I
</p>
<p>thought Your Majesty would have concredited more to me,
</p>
<p>nor to have commanded me to await Your Majesty at the
</p>
<p>door, gif ye thought it not meet to have taken men with

<p>you. Whereupon His Majesty answered to this deponent,
</p>
<p>Alas ! the Traitor deceived me in that, as he did in the
</p>
<p>leave ; for I commanded him expressly to bring you to me,
</p>
<p>^vhich he promised to me, to do; and returned back, as I
</p>
<p>thought, to fetch you, but he did nothing, but steiked the

<p>door. Shortly thereafter, Sir Hugh Herries followed the

</p>
<p>believes that an black man, that was there in company within

<p>that the said John might have din'd: and the deponent

<p>missing His Majesty, and forgathering with the Laird of
</p>
<p>Pittencrief, in the Earl of Gowrie's hall ; and demanding
</p>
<p>of Pittencrief, where His Majesty was ? The said Laird first
</p>
<p>convoyed the deponent to the chamber where the King
</p>
<p>din'd; thereafter to the yaird, hoping that His Majesty
</p>
<p>had been there; and missing His Majesty in the yaird, con-
</p>
<p>voyed the deponent up to an fair gallery, where the depo-
</p>
<p>nent was never before ; where having remained a certain
</p>
<p>space beholding the gallery, they came both down to the
</p>
<p>closs, where they met with Mr Thomas Cranstoun in the
</p>
<p>midst of the closs, who said to them, That His Majesty
</p>
<p>was away upon horse-back, at the Inch : whereupon this

<p>deponent and Pittencrieff sindred, and the deponent passed
</p>
<p>furth of the gate, to his stable, to have gotten his horse^
</p>
<p>and being standing at the stable door, he heard His Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty cry, knew His Highness' voice, but understood not
</p>
<p>what he spake ; whereupon he comes immediately within

<p>the closs, and finding an turnpike door open, he enters
</p>
<p>within the samen, and runs up the turnpike, while he comes
</p>
<p>to the door upon the head thereof, and hearing an struggling

<p>end of the gallery ; the deponent having in the meantime

</p>
<p>I, Mr John Moncriet depones as follows, to wit, That
</p>
<p>day I was still present with my Lord of Gowrie, unto the
</p>
<p>time I heard His Majesty cry, Treason ! and saw him put
</p>
<p>his arm furth of the window of the room, and then left
</p>
<p>him ; for I conceived in' my heart it was plain Treason,
</p>
<p>conspir'd against His Majesty, and was induced hereto, in
</p>
<p>respect of these presumptions following: First, I saw the
</p>
<p>King's Majesty and umquhil Mr Alexander Ruthven my
</p>
<p>Lord's brother go furth at the hall door their alanes ; where-
</p>
<p>as His Majesty had no weapons, and Mr Alexander had a
</p>
<p>sword. Next, I saw His Majesty come in a quiet and so-
</p>
<p>ber manner to the town, where through appear'd, he would
</p>
<p>have no evil purpose in his mind. Item, he said, Mr A-
</p>
<p>lexander riding to Falkland in the morning, was obscured
</p>
<p>from me and my brother Hugh where he was : and I hav-
</p>
<p>ing enquired of my brother Hugh where he was riding to,
</p>
<p>he knew nothing thereof; so that neither he nor I could
</p>
<p>get trial of the same. Item, I having enquired at Andrew
</p>
<p>Henderson himself who rode to Falkland, and returned
</p>
<p>two hours before him, saluted me, and answersed, That he
</p>
<p>had been two or three miles above the town ; and says, the
</p>
<p>said Andrew Henderson had another doublet on, more than
</p>
<p>he used commonly, and was more bulksom ; and, as ap-
</p>
<p>pears, might have contain'd a secret. Item, That day be-
</p>
<p>ing the Council day of the town, my Lord excused himself,
</p>
<p>in respect of his advice. Item, I having pressed him to sub-
</p>
<p>scribe an confirmation of a Lady's, first refused, in respect
</p>
<p>foresaid ; always passed it thereafter. Item, my Lord tar-
</p>
<p>ried longer from his dinner nor he used : and albeit And-
</p>
<p>rew Ruthven, who was with the Master, came and round-
</p>
<p>ed to my Lord at the board, he made him to misknow all
</p>
<p>things, unto the time that the said Mr Alexander came
</p>
<p>himself, and then raise from the board, and met His Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty. Item, my Lord obscured altogether, that he knew

</p>
<p>of the coming of any man, while the Master came. Item,
</p>
<p>Mr Thomas Cranston was the first that I heard cry, The
</p>
<p>King's Majesty is away. Item, after my Lord Duke and
</p>
<p>my Lord Mar, and His Majesty's servants were in the close,
</p>
<p>my Lord of Gowrie came back again to the hall, saying,
</p>
<p>the King is away : so that, as I thought, he would have
</p>
<p>each man thinking so. And I thought His Majesty was
</p>
<p>not received with that hearty complement as became. Item,
</p>
<p>.after His Majesty's riding away, my brother Hugh came
</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p>to my house, and I enquiring of him what he thought of
</p>
<p>thir matters ; answered, Before God, so far as I can per-
</p>
<p>ceive, I trow, it shall kyth an plain Treason on my Lord's
</p>
<p>part* And I speiring at him, if he knew any thing there-
</p>
<p>of? Answered, He knew nothing; but he and Henry Ruth-"
</p>
<p>ven, after all things were ended, tell in conference there-
</p>
<p>anent, and he thought things were likely* Lastly, Andrew
</p>
<p>Henderson's letter moves me most of all. And, upon my
</p>
<p>salvation and condemnation, I know no further in this mat-
</p>
<p>ter ; nor yet can remember of any other circumstance or
</p>
<p>presumption, might have induced me to conceive the form-
</p>
<p>er, which I apprehended, in manner forsaid.

<p>I, Andrew Roy, one of the Bailiies of the burgh of
</p>
<p>Perth, be thir presents testifies upon my conscience, and
</p>
<p>in the sight of God, as I shall answer to him in the great
</p>
<p>day ; That upon the fifth day of August, one thousand and
</p>
<p>six hundred years, I being in the umquhile Earl of Gow-
</p>
<p>rie's lodging, when His Majesty was there, saw His Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty, after his dinner, accompanied with the Master of
</p>
<p>Gowrie, rise from the table, and gang forth of the cham-
</p>
<p>ber where he had din'd ; but to what place, I know not ;
</p>
<p>being beholding the said umquhil Earl of Gowrie's enter-
</p>
<p>tainment of the noblemen, in drinking of His Majesty's
</p>
<p>scoll to them ; which, His Majesty, before his rising from
</p>
<p>the table, had commanded him to do. And after this, the
</p>
<p>Lords, viz. my Lord Duke, my Lord of Mar, my Lord
</p>
<p>Lindores, and my Lord of Inchechaffrey, with sundry of
</p>
<p>His Majesty's gentlemen and servants, accompanied with
</p>
<p>the Earl of Gowrie in person ; and short space after din-
</p>
<p>ner, had missed His Majesty, and enquired where he should
</p>
<p>be ; they went to the foregate, and speird at the porter,
</p>
<p>If he saw the King go furth at the foregate ? and heard the
</p>
<p>porter answer, That His Majesty was not gone furth that

<p>way. Also that the Earl of Gowrie said to the porter, Ye
</p>
<p>lie, knave, He is furth ; and the porter replied, That he
</p>
<p>should give his head, in case his Majesty were furth. Yet,
</p>
<p>upon the Earl of Gowrie's assurance, that His Majesty
</p>
<p>was furth to the Inche, the Lords issued out in haste at the
</p>
<p>foregate, and speiring where the King was, I saw ane ding
</p>
<p>up the long-front window in the north side of the turret,
</p>
<p>upon the Highgate ; but who dang it up I know not. And
</p>
<p>71
</p>
<p>farther, saw clearly His Majesty shut furth his head and
</p>
<p>arm, at the foresaid window, and heard His Majesty cry-
</p>
<p>ing loudly, Fy, treason ! treason ! and murder ! help, Earl
</p>
<p>of Mar ! Whereupon, I being very agast, and wonderfully
</p>
<p>astonished, at that cruel and terrible sight, and pitiful and
</p>
<p>woful cry, I not knowing what the matter meant, but per-
</p>
<p>ceiving His Majesty in extreme and great danger, ran with,
</p>
<p>all possable diligence through the streets, crying loudly, Fy,
</p>
<p>treason, treason against the king ! For God's sake, all ho-
</p>
<p>nest men, haste and relieve the King: And commanded to
</p>
<p>ring the common bell, that all men might come in haste to
</p>
<p>His Majesty's relief; and then I returned with all possable
</p>
<p>diligence, with a great number of the people with me, and
</p>
<p>came before the foresaid turret and window, where I saw
</p>
<p>His Majesty first cry out ; and then I cried out, How is the
</p>
<p>King ? But my Lord Duke, and the Lord of Mar answer-
</p>
<p>ed, The King is well, (Praise be to God.) Then I cried
</p>
<p>again up to His Majesty, and shew his Majesty, That the
</p>
<p>bailies and township were then come in all haste, to supply
</p>
<p>and relieve His Majesty : And therefore besought His Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty to command what was His Majesty's will^ and best to
</p>
<p>be done. And then His Majesty beckoned furth his hand
</p>
<p>to me and to the people, commanding me to cause the peo*
</p>
<p>pie retire to their lodgings. Which commandment. I in*
</p>
<p>continent obeyed, and commanded all manner of men, to
</p>
<p>retire themselves to their lodgings ; and likewise past to the
</p>
<p>market cross, and, by open Proclamation, commanded in
</p>
<p>His Highness's name, That all men should retire to their
</p>
<p>lodgings ; under the pain of treason who obeyed not incon-
</p>
<p>tinent after my charge. And this I testify to be of verity,
</p>
<p>by the faith and truth of my bod)', so far as I justly remem-

<p>not? And he answered, In truth, he is not furth. The

<p>and manner contained in the said Summons, and therefore,
</p>
<p>it was given for Doom, by the mouth of David Lindsay,
</p>
<p>Dempster of Parliament, in manner and form as follows.
</p>
<p>This Court of Parliament shows for Law, That the said
</p>
<p>Alexander Ruthven, Plary Ruthven, his brother ; sons
</p>
<p>?9
</p>
<p>lawful to Alexander Ruthven of Freeland ; Hugh Moncrieff
</p>
<p>brother to William Moncrieff of Moncrieff; and Patrick
</p>
<p>Eviot brother to Colin Eviot of Balhousie ; committed the
</p>
<p>crimes of Treason and Lese- Majesty, against our Sovereign

<p>Lord and his authority royal, in manner at length contain-

<p>ed in the said Summons : And therefore, decerns and declares
</p>
<p>their persons to underly the pains of treason and Lese-Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty, and last punishment proscribed by the laws of this
</p>
<p>realm; all their goods moveable and immoveable, as well
</p>
<p>heritages as offices, benefices, and others whatsomever par-
</p>
<p>taining to them, or whilk is, or might any way belong, or
</p>
<p>appertain to them, to be confiscated to his Majesty, and to
</p>
<p>remain with his Highness in property forever; and their
</p>
<p>posterity to be now, and in all time coming, uncapable and
</p>
<p>unhabil to bruick and possess within this realm, any honours,
</p>
<p>dignities, offices, benefices, successions, or other goods, or
</p>
<p>near, moveable or immoveable. And this I give for doom.
</p>
<p>And to conclude all, the parliament passed an act, in
</p>
<p>the following terms. " In all times and ages to come, the
</p>
<p>fifth of August shall be solemnly kept with prayers, preach-
</p>
<p>ings, and thanks-giving for that benefit, discharging all
</p>
<p>work, labour and other occupations on the said day, which
</p>
<p>might distract the people in any sort, from those pious ex-
</p>
<p>ercises."
</p>
<p>The last Tuesday of September, and the Sunday next
</p>
<p>following had already been observed as days of national
</p>
<p>thanksgiving.
</p>
<p>In the fourth place, we shall enquire, as far as we have
</p>
<p>in our power, into the characters of the witnesses, judges.
</p>
<p>parties and other persons concerned in this transaction, so
</p>
<p>as to ascertain, as near as possible, what credibility is due
</p>
<p>to their evidence, or what their motives were, for intermed-
</p>
<p>dling in this affair. '
</p>
<p>1st. Mr William Coupar is the first of these who falls to

</p>
<p>be taken notice of. In his younger years he had been .a
</p>
<p>zealous Presbyterian. He was ordained minister of Both-
</p>
<p>kennar in 1587, and was removed thence to Perth in 1595.
</p>
<p>Although he had not the good fortune to be present at or
</p>
<p>contribute to the Earl's death, the assistance which he gave
</p>
<p>in ruining his character, small as it was, is sufficient to shew
</p>
<p>so
</p>
<p>his obsequious zeal. He, and his colleague Mr Malcolm*
</p>
<p>left Perth the day before, (August 4th.) for Stirling, where
</p>
<p>the Synod of that bounds sat down on the 5th. The news
</p>
<p>of what had happened at Perth, reached them before their
</p>
<p>return, and on Friday following, he posted from Stirling,
</p>
<p>direct to Falkland, and there, through the medium of Spot^
</p>
<p>tiswood, vented the story of his catching the Earl, some
</p>
<p>days before, perusing a treatise on the conspiracies of Prin-
</p>
<p>ces ; the probability of which, we shall have occasion after-
</p>
<p>wards to investigate* . In the mean time, we are to observe,
</p>
<p>that even admitting the truth of it, the divulging it at that
</p>
<p>time shewed Coupar to have had a bad heart, and to have
</p>
<p>been a time-server; two traits of his character which are
</p>
<p>said to have been very prominent. Gowry was his Parishioner,
</p>
<p>and regularly attended his ministry. His theological pro-
</p>
<p>fession was purely orthodox, according to the Geneva con-
</p>
<p>fession, the Standard of the Kirk ; and even although he
</p>
<p>had been a traitor, now when he could do no more harm,
</p>
<p>Coupar, unless called upon, might well have declined tak-
</p>
<p>ing any share in his condemnation, when he had nothing
</p>
<p>to soy more to the purpose than this silly fabrication. The
</p>
<p>truth is, he saw the Presbyterian cause had received a shock,
</p>
<p>which it was not likely long to survive, so he thought it best
</p>
<p>to offer his services in some other way. It was, however a
</p>
<p>long time before they were suitably rewarded. Fourteen
</p>
<p>years did he wait at the pool side : at length in 1614 he was
</p>
<p>made bishop of Galloway, and dean of the chapel-royal.
</p>
<p>He died at Leith, Feb. 15, 1619.
</p>
<p>2d. James Weemys of Bogie is the first witness whose
</p>
<p>deposition is on record. He was examined, in a precogni-
</p>
<p>tion taken at Falkland, on Saturday the 9th, before the
</p>
<p>principal officers of State. It is altogether foreign to any
</p>
<p>plot, real or pretended, against the king's person; ajid
</p>
<p>respects the Earl only, taking no notice of his brother A-

</p>
<p>lexander. It's sole drift evidently is, to represent Gowry
</p>
<p>as a Magician or Necromancer, and for that purpose, gives
</p>
<p>an account of some conversations which the deponent bad
</p>
<p>with him. The story from beginning: to end would at this
</p>
<p>time be considered as below ridicule. If Weemys was serious
</p>
<p>in his declaration, whoever should have burnt him for a witch,
</p>
<p>would certainly have lost their coals. But there is ground
</p>
<p>for suspecting, that he was more knave than fool. He saw
</p>
<p>that the Earl could be of no more service to him as a friend.
</p>
<p>81
</p>
<p>being a Gentleman of the Bedchamber, he, no doubt, found
</p>
<p>it prudent to take part with his master and fellow servants
</p>
<p>Besides these, there was another circumstance, which per-
</p>
<p>haps would weigh something with him. He. had been as-
</p>
<p>sisting to Stewart Earl of Bothwell in some of his treason-
</p>
<p>able exploits, for which he was apprehended and put in
</p>
<p>confinement, A. D. 1592. But being on an intimate foot-
</p>
<p>ing with one of the Queen's maids, she, one night after
</p>
<p>their majesties had retired to rest, applied to the guard
</p>
<p>who had him in custody, and told that the king wished
</p>
<p>to have the prisoner brought to his apartments, for the
</p>
<p>purpose of asking some questions of him. The guard
</p>
<p>conducted him to the chamber door, which he entered, and
</p>
<p>by the help of the girl, was let down from a window, and
</p>
<p>escaped. He afterwards married his deliverer, and at the
</p>
<p>Queen's intercession was pardoned. Thus gratitude and
</p>
<p>interest combined at this time to induce him to assist James
</p>
<p>at a dead pull.
</p>
<p>3d. Mr William Rynd was examined, in a precognition
</p>
<p>taken before the Junto at Falkland on the 20th. and 22d.
</p>
<p>of the month.
</p>
<p>He was the fourth son of Mr William Rynd, minister of
</p>
<p>Kinnoul, in the immediate neighbourhood of Perth : and is
</p>
<p>said to have been Rector of the Grammar School of that
</p>
<p>city. We know that the elder Mr Rynd, along with the
</p>
<p>cure of Kinnoul, was Rector of the Grammar School in
</p>
<p>Perth, and lived till 1610. So that it is probable the young-
</p>
<p>er Mr Rynd was only assistant to his father.
</p>
<p>He accompanied Gowry abroad, as travelling tutor. It
</p>
<p>appears from the forged letters ascribed to Logan, that
</p>
<p>Rynd was looked upon as a pious, cautious man : and from
</p>
<p>the questions which were put to him at Falkland, he seems
</p>
<p>to have lived on terms of considerable intimacy with the
</p>
<p>Earl, and consequently would not willingly say any thing

</p>
<p>to his prejudice; but, as his evidence could not fail to make
</p>
<p>an impression, it was indispensably necessary. There re-
</p>
<p>mained then no alternative, but to force what answers they
</p>
<p>wished for from him by torture ; a method which they re-
</p>
<p>sorted to accordingly. Xicolson the English Resident in
</p>
<p>Scotland, in a letter to Cecil dated the next day (August 21.)
</p>
<p>the original of which is extant in the Paper Office, writes
</p>
<p>' Mr William Rynd the Pedagogue, hath been extremely
</p>
<p>XJ
</p>
<p>booted, but confesseth nothing of that matter against the
</p>
<p>Earl or his brother."
</p>
<p>4th. The same day in which Mr Rynd was questioned,
</p>
<p>another of Gfowry's servants was examined. But he was
</p>
<p>more pliable than the other. He took care to have no oc-
</p>
<p>casion for the boots. This was Andrew Henderson, cham-
</p>
<p>berlain or factor on the Earl's Perthshire estate. He was
</p>
<p>the only one that pretended to know any thing of what pas-
</p>
<p>sed in the closet betwixt the king and Alexander Ruthven.
</p>
<p>His was the only evidence, which directly brought home to
</p>
<p>the two brothers any treasonable attempt upon the king's
</p>
<p>person, consequently was the most material of the whole,
</p>
<p>provided, it could have been depended on ; to ascertain
</p>
<p>which, we have only to inform ourselves what sort of man
</p>
<p>Henderson was.
</p>
<p>Spottiswood, who was his contemporary, a courtier, and
</p>
<p>strenuous advocate for James, speaking of Henderson, says
</p>
<p>" The man was of a servile spirit, and apt enough to do mis-
</p>
<p>chief." i. e. He was a mischievous scoundrel. This is sav-
</p>
<p>ing a great deal, but still it is saying too little. He certainly
</p>
<p>was the most consummate villain, (with perhaps a single ex-
</p>
<p>ception) who at that time existed on Scottish ground. On
</p>
<p>this occasion he literally sold himself to do wickedness,
</p>
<p>When he saw the Earl fall, and had no prospect of being
</p>
<p>further benefited by the house of Ruthven, he came forward,
</p>
<p>by the persuasion of Galloway the King's chaplain, and the
</p>
<p>promise of pardon, and an annuity for life ; and swore to a
</p>
<p>number of inconsistent falshoods, thereby facilitating the
</p>
<p>royal design of annihilating the family, and seizing its pro-
</p>
<p>perty. He, with Weemys, and Christie, were the only ser-
</p>

<p>ther appointed, one of the resident magistrates ; partly, no
</p>
<p>doubt, because he found him a very proper tool to work
</p>
<p>with, when it was inconvenient for himself to be present ;
</p>
<p>and partly, as we may presume, with the view of again pro-
</p>
<p>curing Henderson some respectability. But he was held
</p>
<p>in such detestation by every body, that it was found the man
</p>
<p>might bring the office into contempt ; but the office could
</p>
<p>not raise the man into esteem. Therefore, after a year's tri*
</p>
<p>83
</p>
<p>al the attempt was abandoned. Spottiswood says " he look t
</p>
<p>ever after that time as one half distracted". Which in^
</p>
<p>deed is nothing but what might have been expected ; for
</p>
<p>supposing him to have had nothing about him of what w^
</p>
<p>call conscience, yet he knew, that he was contemned by
</p>
<p>every body. Gowry's friends held him in abhorrence as a
</p>
<p>principal agent in the murder and robbery; and those who
</p>
<p>paid him for his service on that occasion, now that they
</p>
<p>had no more use for him, despised him, as a mercenary ruf-
</p>
<p>fian. So that it is more surprising he did not put an untime-
</p>
<p>ly end to his earthly existence, than that he was ashamed
</p>
<p>to be seer;. The evidence of such a wretch will at all times
</p>
<p>be considered as suspicious, even when consistent with itself
</p>
<p>and corroborated by collateral circumstances; but when
</p>
<p>composed of incoherencies, and improbabilities, no ration-
</p>
<p>al person has it in his power, sincerely to assent to it. De-
</p>
<p>plorable indeed is the state of that country whose judicial
</p>
<p>proceedings can be influenced by such methods. We shall
</p>
<p>afterwards have occasion, when reviewing Henderson's de-
</p>
<p>positions, to point out a number of his perjuries,
</p>
<p>5th. Mr Patrick Galloway the king's chaplain endeavour-
</p>
<p>ed as much as in him lay to infuse a belief of the reality of
</p>
<p>James's story into the public mind. And it was said at the
</p>
<p>time to have been principally at his instigation that Hen-
</p>
<p>derson agreed to acknowledge himself to have been the arm-
</p>
<p>ed man in the closet. Galloway continued to adhere to the
</p>
<p>Presbyterian form of church government all his life, though
</p>
<p>he was a courtier and saw that it was exceeding obnoxious
</p>
<p>to the king. He even presided in several meetings of the
</p>
<p>clergy, and occasionally was their spokesman in claiming
</p>
<p>what they conceived to be their rights. But there is great
</p>
<p>reason for believing, that he was employed by the king, as
</p>
<p>a spy, to watch their conduct, and suffered to go so far
</p>
<p>along with them, that he might share in their councils, and

</p>
<p>lead them into that course, which his Majesty was so an-
</p>
<p>xious for them to follow.
</p>
<p>With all his failings, he seems to have preserved a de-
</p>
<p>gree of consistency in one respect, viz. that whoever had
</p>
<p>the civil power in their hands, he would be minister of the
</p>
<p>gospel at Perth. He was appointed to that charge in 1580,
</p>
<p>and attached himself to William Earl of Gowry, and that
</p>
<p>party which opposed Lennox and Arran. On that account
</p>
<p>he became so obnoxious to James, that when these minion?
</p>
<p>L2
</p>
<p>84
</p>
<p>got again into power, he found it necessary to leave his
</p>
<p>cure and retire into England. Next year, however, he
</p>
<p>found means to make his peace and returned to Perth. In
</p>
<p>1589 he was appointed chaplain to the king, from which
</p>
<p>we may fairly infer, that he had given up all his seditious
</p>
<p>notions. And for the destruction of the house of Ruthven,
</p>
<p>he appears to have been a zealous partisan of James. He
</p>
<p>was at Perch on the fifth of August, and used all his rheto-?
</p>
<p>ric to persuade the townsmen of Gowry's guilt; and on
</p>
<p>James's arrival in Edinburgh on the eleventh, he did the
</p>
<p>same from the cross of that city, in a kind of sermon. It
</p>
<p>is not said, what rewards Galloway received for his ser-
</p>
<p>vices at this time, further than that of being appointed one
</p>
<p>of the ministers of Edinburgh, and having a pension which
</p>
<p>he received out of the estate of Scone doubled. We are
</p>
<p>told that James, his son, was in great favour both with
</p>
<p>King James, and Charles his son. The first of whom
</p>
<p>made him Master of Requests, when very young. The lat-
</p>
<p>ter created him Lord Dunkeld. Rut his grandson, joining
</p>
<p>Viscount Dundee with what forces he could raise at Kilii-
</p>
<p>cr.an.ky, was outlawed.
</p>
<p>6th. Mr David Jjindsay was a son of Lindsay of Edzel
</p>
<p>in Angus. He had been a strenuous abettor of the Duke
</p>
<p>of Lennox, and did every thing in his power to have him
</p>
<p>recalled from exile, after the Raid of Ruthven. His fawn-
</p>
<p>ing disposition, and attachment to Lennox recommended
</p>
<p>him to king James. He accompanied the king to Norway
</p>
<p>to bring home his Queen. He married them, and conti-
</p>
<p>nued all winter with them in that country. He baptized
</p>
<p>some of their children, particularly the unfortunate Charles.
</p>
<p>He was minister of Leith, and on the 5th of August
</p>
<p>was at Falkland, whether accidentally, or designedly that he
</p>
<p>might carry the news to Edinburgh, we pretend not to
</p>
<p>know. But he arrived in that cit} r at ten in the forenoon

<p>cf Wednesday, the sixth, so that he must have been early
</p>
<p>on the road. When he got there, the council and clergy
</p>
<p>were contending about convening the people, and solemnly
</p>
<p>giving God thanks for His Majesty's deliverance. Lindsay
</p>
<p>having received his account of the matter from the king,
</p>
<p>there could no longer be any doubt among Courtiers as to
</p>
<p>its authenticity. So he was desired to officiate on this oc-
</p>
<p>casion, in place of the Edinburgh Clergy. Accordingly,
</p>
<p>from the top of the market cross he addressed the surround-
</p>
<p>85
</p>
<p>ing multitude, endeavouring to persuade it, of the reality of
</p>
<p>the treasonable attempt of the two brothers. And then for-
</p>
<p>mally praised God, for this singular interposition of his pro-
</p>
<p>vidence. And when James crossed the Forth on the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing Monday, Lindsay again harangued the people, in
</p>
<p>Leith Church, in the king's presence, before his Majesty
</p>
<p>went up to Edinburgh. So much obsequiousness required
</p>
<p>some recompence; accordingly he was made Bishop of
</p>
<p>Ross in the following October; which dignity, together
</p>
<p>with the cure of Leith, he enjoyed till his death in 1613.
</p>
<p>He accompanied James to England ; and when an attempt
</p>
<p>was made to unite the two kingdoms ; Lindsay was appoint-
</p>
<p>ed a commissioner for that purpose.
</p>
<p>7th. Archbishop Spottiswood was a son of the parson
</p>
<p>of Calder. He seems to have been a busy, meddling
</p>
<p>churchman; and an insinuating scrambler at Court. At
</p>
<p>the time of Gowry's death, he himself was parson of Cal-
</p>
<p>der; but soon got much into favour. In 1602, he went as
</p>
<p>chaplain to Lennox in his embassy to France. Next year,
</p>
<p>lie set out for London with James, on his accession to the
</p>
<p>English crown ; but the account of Archbishop Beaton's
</p>
<p>death overtaking them on their way, James appointed
</p>
<p>.Spottiswood his successor in the see of Glasgow, and made
</p>
<p>liim a Privy Councillor. He retained Glasgow till 1615,
</p>
<p>when a vacancy happening in the primacy, by the death
</p>
<p>of Archbishop Gladstanes, Spottiswood was translated to
</p>
<p>St Andrews. Soon afterwards, he had interest enough, to
</p>
<p>get the rents of the priory of that city added to those of the
</p>
<p>Archbishopric. He continued in favour even after James's
</p>
<p>death. It was then that he wrote his History of Scotland,
</p>
<p>Laving been employed by James to do so; in which he gives
</p>
<p>some account of the Gowry conspiracy; but as might be
</p>
<p>expected in such a case, it is a very partial and incorrect
</p>
<p>one. Charles the First made him Chancellor in 1635, but

</p>
<p>he was outed in 1638, and died in London the following
</p>
<p>year.
</p>
<p>8th. Colonel William Stewart of Houston was a cadet
</p>
<p>of the Darnly family. In 1567, he was made Commenda-
</p>
<p>tor of Pittenweem; and in 1585 got a grant of the lands
</p>
<p>belonging to that abbey. James made him Gentleman of
</p>
<p>the Bedchamber, and Captain of the Guard. Indeed he
</p>
<p>seems to have stood very high in the king's favour ; as he
</p>
<p>was twice entrusted with a commission to treat for a wife to
</p>
<p>$6
</p>
<p>him; and commanded the fleet which carried James to
</p>
<p>Denmark, and in which he and his Queen came home.
</p>
<p>Besides this, he was employed in some other embassies; and
</p>
<p>was the person commissioned to apprehend William Earl of
</p>
<p>Gowry. Though presumptive heir to his brother Thomas
</p>
<p>Stewart of Grandtully, he was knighted in Sir Thomas'
</p>
<p>lifetime, and at his death succeeded to his honours, and
</p>
<p>the patrimonial estate.
</p>
<p>The most probable reason why he was not brought for-
</p>
<p>ward as a witness at the trial, is having been employed to
</p>
<p>seize the first Earl of Gowry, when it was determined to
</p>
<p>put him to death. Earl John, after returning from his tra-
</p>
<p>vels, expressed so much aversion to him on that account,
</p>
<p>as to induce the king to reprimand him, (Gowry). This
</p>
<p>being the case, it perhaps was judged too bare-faced a step,
</p>
<p>to use Stewart's evidence against the two brothers ; and it
</p>
<p>certainly was unnecessary, as plenty of witnesses could be
</p>
<p>obtained from other quarters.
</p>
<p>He accompanied Lennox, and that band of assassins
</p>
<p>who beset the principal stair ; and from his known charac-
</p>
<p>ter, we may presume, that had not those who went up the
</p>
<p>private stair been before hand with him, this Ruffian would
</p>
<p>have been the Sir John Ramsay of Lennox's division.
</p>
<p>However, though he was not in the room at the death of
</p>
<p>the two brothers, James knew that was no fault of his, and
</p>
<p>therefore bestowed one of the Earl's estates on him, for his
</p>
<p>faithful services done the king, especially this at Perth on
</p>
<p>the fifth of August.
</p>
<p>Besides his cruelty, Colonel Stewart, on some occasions,
</p>
<p>furnished striking instances of his perfidious disposition.
</p>
<p>When but a young man, he contrived to ingratiate him-
</p>
<p>self into the favour of those noblemen who rescued King
</p>
<p>James at Huntingtower from Lennox and Arran. Although
</p>
<p>he was a younger brother of Arran, he was sent by that

<p>party who committed the Raid of Ruthyen, ambassador to
</p>
<p>England in April, 1583, whence he returned the following
</p>
<p>June, and in a few weeks afterwards, we find him a princi-
</p>
<p>pal assistant to James in his elopement from St Andrews*.
</p>
<p>9th. William the eldest son of John Murray of Tulli-
</p>
<p>bardine, was in Perth on the fifth of August 1600. He
</p>
<p>was said to have been eminently serviceable in pacifying the
</p>
<p>* It is remarkable that Margaret Stewart, John Knox's second wife, was
</p>
<p>sister to Arran, and this Colonel Stewart.
</p>
<p>populace, wnose fury seems to have inclined them to go to
</p>
<p>the utmost extremities. In reward he got the Sheriffship
</p>
<p>of Perthshire, which was heritable in the RuthVen family,
</p>
<p>and which continued in his family till the abolition of the
</p>
<p>Heritable Jurisdictions in 1748. Gowry's Family Seat,
</p>
<p>Ruthven Castle and Estate, was also given to Murray. In
</p>
<p>1604 his father John was made Lord Murray; and in 1606
</p>
<p>Earl of Tullibardine. Charles the First created him Earl
</p>
<p>of Athole.
</p>
<p>10th. The Sir David Murray of Gospetrie, whom we
</p>
<p>hear of on this occasion, was, at that time, second son of
</p>
<p>Sir Andrew Murray of Balvaird, to whom he afterwards
</p>
<p>succeeded. He was bred up at the court, and became a.
</p>
<p>very great favourite. James made him Cupbearer, Master
</p>
<p>of the Horse, and Captain of the Guard. He was after-
</p>
<p>wards made a Knight, and Comptroller of the Revenue.
</p>
<p>It was however thought necessary, that something still
</p>
<p>more substantial should be provided for one who stood so
</p>
<p>high in the king's estimation. Accordingly, he was at
</p>
<p>Perth, on the fifth of August, when, besides any share he
</p>
<p>had in the assassination, he, together with his relation,
</p>
<p>Murray younger of Tullibardine, were very active in quiet-
</p>
<p>ing the enraged townsmen, whose threats terrified James
</p>
<p>so much. He attended the king to Falkland in the evening.
</p>
<p>Preserving James's life in such an emergency, was, no
</p>
<p>doubt, a great service ; but it was amply rewarded. The
</p>
<p>Abbacy of Scone, which Gowry held in commendam, was
</p>
<p>erected into a Lordship, and bestowed on him. A grant
</p>
<p>afterwards confirmed by Act of Parliament. He got the
</p>
<p>Rangership of the Lomonds, and Falkland Park, and Cas-
</p>
<p>tlestead, besides several other beneficial grants.
</p>
<p>He was appointed Commissioner to several General As-
</p>
<p>semblies, where he toiled hard to subvert the Presbyterian
</p>
<p>form of Church government*. And on the Five Articles
</p>
<p>of Perth being ratified by parliament, A. D. 1621. His

<p>Majesty's Representative, the Marquis of Hamilton, dis-
</p>
<p>patched him to London with the news; which were so
</p>
<p>grateful to James that he created him Viscount Stormont.
</p>
<p>He married Elisabeth Beaton, grand-daughter of the Cardi-
</p>
<p>* If we can believe Calderwood, he (Sir David) was a man of brutal
</p>
<p>manners and ungovernable passions, after he got into power, as appeared by
</p>
<p>his behaviour in the Synod held at Perth in J 607 ; and his treatment of the
</p>
<p>historian himself, while leading him to prison in St Andrews.
</p>
<p>hal, but had no children by her. At his death, in 1631^
</p>
<p>he was possessed of a very great landed estate. His titles
</p>
<p>fell successively to six or seven different branches of the
</p>
<p>Murray s, and at last settled in an ancestor of the present
</p>
<p>Earl of Mansfield.
</p>
<p>11th. David Moyse was a domestic of the king's. He,
</p>
<p>unintentionally it is presumed, was the cause of much vex-
</p>
<p>ation to his Master, by sending an account of the affair at
</p>
<p>Perth, to Edinburgh early on the next morning, without
</p>
<p>consulting James or those who framed the government nar-
</p>
<p>rative relative to the circumstances of the transaction which
</p>
<p>were to be communicated to the world. The consequence
</p>
<p>was, that the one account differing so much from the other,
</p>
<p>suspicion was aroused, enquiry set a foot, and the truth
</p>
<p>discovered to the public.
</p>
<p>Moyse afterwards wrote an account of some transactions
</p>
<p>of his own time, and amongst others makes mention of the
</p>
<p>Gowry Conspiracy. But as he published scon after the
</p>
<p>date of that event, he dared advance no gross improbabili-
</p>
<p>ties and falsehoods, as some, who lived an hundred years
</p>
<p>afterwards did.
</p>
<p>12th. George, the first Earl of Cromarty, must hot be
</p>
<p>overlooked in this list, he having particularly interested
</p>
<p>himself in behalf of James's account of the affair. He pub-
</p>
<p>lished, An Account of the Gowry Conspiracy ; a perform-
</p>
<p>ance no ways serviceable to the cause it was meant to sup-
</p>
<p>port, so very unfair and even false are many of its state-
</p>
<p>ments. Yet he pretends to great impartiality in his narra-
</p>
<p>tive; and as a kind of collateral security, that he would
</p>
<p>not blacken the character of the Ruthven Family undeser-
</p>
<p>vedly, he tells us, that he had been married to two wives
</p>
<p>descended of that house.  His first wife was daughter to
</p>
<p>Sir John Sinclair of Moy. How she was related to Gowry
</p>
<p>does not appear. After he was on the wrong side of sixty,
</p>
<p>he married Margaret Countess of Weemys in her own

<p>right, the young widow of Lord Weemys of Burntisland.
</p>
<p>Her grandfather's grandmother was Cecilia daughter to
</p>
<p>William, second Lord Ruthven, great-grandfather to
</p>
<p>Earl John ; a very remote connection indeed, and which,
</p>
<p>on the other side, is certainly much more than counterba-
</p>
<p>lanced by his (Cromarty's) mother being niece to the three
</p>
<p>Erskins who acted so conspicuous a part in this affair. A
</p>
<p>circumstance certainly equally deserving of notice with the
</p>
<p>89
</p>
<p>fcther, as being much more likely to influence his opinion i
</p>
<p>But that is not the only particular in which his disingenui-
</p>
<p>ty appears. In the preface to this pamphlet, he tells us,
</p>
<p>that the presbyterian clergy, and among the rest Mr Ro-
</p>
<p>bert Rollock did " invent and clandestinely propagate that
</p>
<p>Gowry and his brother did never conspire against the king.
</p>
<p>But that the King did murder them both." That such re-
</p>
<p>port was propagated is unquestionable. But Rollock died
</p>
<p>in 1598, two years before the death of the Earl and his bro-
</p>
<p>ther. Again, he says that Cranston and Craigengelt, the
</p>
<p>Earl's two servants, who were hanged for being accessories
</p>
<p>to the plot, asserted, That Gowry did not mean to murder
</p>
<p>the King, but only to cause him make some sort of repara-
</p>
<p>tion for the death of Earl William. But Spottiswood, who
</p>
<p>attended at their execution, though a courtier, and professed
</p>
<p>believer in Gowry's guilt, assures us, that they persisted to
</p>
<p>the last in denying all knowledge of any kind of conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Cromarty's partiality is likewise manifested in his inten-
</p>
<p>tionally declining to give the copy of the letter from Logan
</p>
<p>to Gowry as first published in Sprott's confession, seeing it
</p>
<p>differs so much from that, which was afterwards attempted
</p>
<p>to be palmed on the public, as the same letter, on Logan's
</p>
<p>trial.
</p>
<p>Cromarty did not publish his account of the conspiracy
</p>
<p>till 1713, more than a hundred years after it happened*
</p>
<p>By which time, he no doubt thought, that he might use
</p>
<p>some freedoms with truth, as all who witnessed any part of
</p>
<p>the transactions were long since dead. And that he might
</p>
<p>be the more certain of doing this with impunity, he takes
</p>
<p>great credit for the authenticity of his relation, as from his
</p>
<p>situation of Lord Register, he had an opportunity of draw-
</p>
<p>ing his information from the National Records. But we
</p>
<p>have already had occasion to advert to his integrity as an
</p>
<p>Extractor, and we shall by and by have an opportunity of

<p>judging what dependence can be placed in the purity of the*
</p>
<p>National Records of the reign of James the Sixth.
</p>
<p>Cromarty's family was much indebted to the Stewart
</p>
<p>Dynasty. James the Sixth knighted Colin, this Earl's
</p>
<p>grandfather, and bestowed on him a landed estate to sup-
</p>
<p>port the honour. Charles the First created Sir John, his
</p>
<p>father, a baronet. Charles the Second made himself Gene-
</p>
<p>ral of his Forces, a Lord of Session in 1661 ; Justice Ge-
</p>
<p>neral in 1678; and Lord Register in 168L At the Reya-
</p>
<p>M
</p>
<p>90
</p>
<p>lotion he lost the place of Lord Register, but obtained it'
</p>
<p>again in 1692. Queen Ann made him Secretary of State
</p>
<p>in 1702, and Earl of Cromarty in 1703. It was in 1713
</p>
<p>that he dedicated his Account of the Gowry Conspiracy to
</p>
<p>the Queen, and next year he died, aged 84. So many fa-
</p>
<p>vours received required some return.
</p>
<p>His son and grandson were attainted for rebellion.
</p>
<p>Perhaps similar causes have had no very dissimilar ef-
</p>
<p>fects, on more modern historians, by causing them perceive
</p>
<p>difficulties where there were none, and inducing them to
</p>
<p>substitute fanciful theories, for a very plain matter of fact.
</p>
<p>But rather than enlarge on this, we shall pass on to exa-
</p>
<p>mine the character of such of the witnesses, as we are any
</p>
<p>way acquainted with. And the first in order is
</p>
<p>Ludoviek, Duke of Lennox. Fie might have been ex-
</p>
<p>pected to befriend the Ruthvens, as he had married one of
</p>
<p>their sisters. But she had been dead some time, without
</p>
<p>bearing him any children, and he married again. Pos-
</p>
<p>sibly too, Lennox was one of that sort of men, who are
</p>
<p>prudent enough, not to sacrifice their own interest to their
</p>
<p>affection for their wives; their regard for her relations; and
</p>
<p>iar less to her memory after her death. He married for his
</p>
<p>second wife, Margaret, daughter of Sir Mathew Campbel
</p>
<p>of London, High Sheriff of Ayr, widow of GifYen, Master
</p>
<p>of Eglinton. On trial, he did not like her ; so he sent her
</p>
<p>away. Some few years after he accompanied the King to
</p>
<p>London, the poor woman followed him, expecting, no-
</p>
<p>doubt, that he might relent, and receive her again. But
</p>
<p>his Grace was now become greater than ever : so, instead
</p>
<p>of co-habiting with her, he packed her off for Scotland.
</p>
<p>On this she broke her heart, and he married Frances,
</p>
<p>Countess of Hartford. We hope it will not be deemed rash,
</p>
<p>merely to say? that perhaps he might regard Lady Sophia
</p>
<p>Ruthven, as little, as he did the Sheriff of Ayr's daughter.

</p>
<p>But, however that might have been, it appears, that upon
</p>
<p>the dissolution of this connection, his regard for the family,
</p>
<p>(if he ever had any) was extinguished, for he took a very
</p>
<p>active part in effecting its ruin. He did not indeed, like
</p>
<p>Ramsay, run any of them through the body, but he took
</p>
<p>care, when he left Falkland on the fifth of August, for
</p>
<p>Perth, to be provided with arms, in case his services this
</p>
<p>way had been required; and he swore to what we now
</p>
<p>know to have been a string of falsehoods : and* as if decency
</p>
<p>m
</p>
<p>had not been enough outraged, by his being himself both
</p>
<p>the criminal party, and a perjured witness in this cause, he
</p>
<p>sat a judge, and gave his vote, for convicting his former
</p>
<p>brothers-in-law of a crime, which he was conscious never
</p>
<p>was perpetrated.
</p>
<p>To account in some measure for this, we are to observe
</p>
<p>that he was a relation of James's. His father, Esme D' Au-
</p>
<p>bigny, was cousin to Lord Darnly, consequently the King
</p>
<p>and Lndovick were second cousins. Both he, and his fa-
</p>
<p>ther Esme, were great favourites of James's: he brought
</p>
<p>Esme from France; or rather as some supposed, the Guises
</p>
<p>sent him over, as they had now lost the influence, which
</p>
<p>they had formerly possessed in Scotland, under the Cardinal
</p>
<p>and Queen Regent. They therefore had recourse to this
</p>
<p>method of retaining their interest in the country; and their
</p>
<p>missionary proved himself perfectly well qualified for the
</p>
<p>trust reposed in him, being a person of agreeable manners,
</p>
<p>and pliable disposition, very capable of accommodating his,
</p>
<p>to the dissolute course, wmich James about this tkne began
</p>
<p>to follow. D'Aubigny, in conjunction with James Stewart,
</p>
<p>Earl of Arran, gained a complete ascendency over the
</p>
<p>King, who even prevailed on the Earl of Lennox, to resign
</p>
<p>that title into his hands, and it was then bestowed on D'Au-
</p>
<p>bigny, along with the rich abbacy of Arbroath, and the
</p>
<p>government of Dunbarton Castle, the better to enable him
</p>
<p>to support the new dignity. In 1581 he was made Duke o;
</p>
<p>Lennox. When he came first to Scotland, he was a pro-
</p>
<p>fessed papist, and on his being so much caressed by James,
</p>
<p>the Romish priests and Jesuits began again to take heart,
</p>
<p>and teach their doctrines openly. But the prudent part of
</p>
<p>the Catholics saw, that matters were not ripe for that
</p>
<p>change; and heavy complaints being made against the King,
</p>
<p>for his so great familiarity with one of that religion, it was
</p>
<p>thought more prudent for Lennox to join the kirk ; so he

</p>
<p>became a Presbyterian ; but never w T as thought sincere in
</p>
<p>that. At length the dissatisfaction of the country rose so
</p>
<p>high, that a number of the nobles seized James at Ruthven
</p>
<p>Castle, and banished Lennox to France. He survived this
</p>
<p>only a short time, dying at Paris, the following May.
</p>
<p>James no sooner recovered his liberty, than he sent the
</p>
<p>Master of Gray to France, for Lennox's children : but only
</p>
<p>Ludovick the eldest, came over at that time. He was then
</p>
<p>thirteen years of age. He arrived in November 1583.

</p>
<p>James's favour seemed redoubled towards this youth. Of all
</p>
<p>his favourites young Lennox was the greatest. The King
</p>
<p>iirst superintended his education, and we may suppose, did
</p>
<p>not fail to instil into him some of his own immoral princi-
</p>
<p>ples. After he grew up, James bestowed many baronies or
</p>
<p>estates upon him, particularly betwixt A. D. 1590 and 1600.
</p>
<p>He likewise appointed him Heritable Admiral of Scotland,
</p>
<p>The office of Lord- High- Chamberlain, which had lien
</p>
<p>long dormant, was revived, and bestowed on him. So much
</p>
<p>favour certainly deserved some return. Accordingly, the
</p>
<p>part which he acted on this occasion, though enormously
</p>
<p>wicked, was certainly meant to be of great service to the
</p>
<p>royal cause; as not only tending to retrieve James's character
</p>
<p>from the general odium attached to it, by superintending
</p>
<p>the murder of the two brothers, but likewise as affording
</p>
<p>some countenance, in that part of the tragedy, which was
</p>
<p>still to be acted. In 1602, Lennox was sent ambassador to
</p>
<p>Prance. When James succeeded in 1603 to the English
</p>
<p>Crown, he acquired additional means of gratifying favourites.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, he made Lennox Earl of Newcastle, Duke of
</p>
<p>Richmond, Master of the Household, first Gentleman of
</p>
<p>the Bedchamber, and K. G. In 1607, he was appointed
</p>
<p>Commissioner to the Scotch Parliament. He continued to
</p>
<p>enjoy James's favour till his death in 1624.
</p>
<p>2d. John Earl of Mar. He had been educated in Stir-
</p>
<p>ling castle, along with the king. They had grown up to-
</p>
<p>gether, and very probably, formed a mutual attachment.
</p>
<p>Mar was married to a sister of Lennox. In 1601, he was
</p>
<p>sent ambassador to queen Elibabeth, under pretence of
</p>
<p>congratulating her on the suppression of Essex's insurrection,
</p>
<p>but in reality to treat with Sir Robert Cecil for securing and
</p>
<p>facilitating James's accession, for which purpose they accor-
</p>
<p>dingly entered into terms. Mar obtained the heritable of-
</p>
<p>fices of Commander of Stirling Castle, Sheriff of that Shire,

</p>
<p>Chamberlain of Stirling, Monteith, and Brichen, and Bail-
</p>
<p>lie and Admiral of Forth. He got a charter of Novoda-
</p>
<p>mits, erecting his extensive paternal estates, along with ma-
</p>
<p>ny others, which he received from the king, into a free
</p>
<p>Earldom, and a pension of 2000 crowns. He enjoyed at
</p>
<p>the same time, the offices of Lord High Treasurer; Comp-
</p>
<p>troller and Collector of Scotland : and, after the accession,
</p>
<p>James made him a Privy Counsellor, and K. G. at Wind-
</p>
<p>sor, in 1603.
</p>
<p>93
</p>
<p>3d. The three Erskins, Thomas, James, and George,
</p>
<p>were cousins German to Mar; their father, Alexander
</p>
<p>Erskin of Gogar, being brother to Mar the Regent, upon
</p>
<p>whose death he was appointed guardian of the young king
</p>
<p>jointly with the Countess Dowager. It is not said, what
</p>
<p>remuneration James or George received; but as their bro-
</p>
<p>ther Thomas, and even James's servant Wilson, were so
</p>
<p>amply rewarded, we may presume, they were not overlook-
</p>
<p>ed. Thomas, and very probably the other two, was brought
</p>
<p>up like a brother, with king James, who, we are told, was
</p>
<p>very fond of him, and conferred many favours on him. In
</p>
<p>1585 he was made Gentleman of the Bedchamber. But, this
</p>
<p>being an office of small emolument, upon the forfeiture of
</p>
<p>Gowry, Thomas had a donation of the Dirlton estate : and
</p>
<p>in 1603 was created Lord Dirlton. He accompanied James
</p>
<p>to England, and, upon the fall of Sir Walter Raleigh, he
</p>
<p>obtained his place of Captain of the Guard. James still
</p>
<p>continuing to heap favours upon him, he was made Viscount
</p>
<p>Fenton in 1606, Earl of Kelly, and K. G. in 1609. His
</p>
<p>deposition agrees, in almost every particular, with that of
</p>
<p>his brother-in-law, the falsity of which evidence we shall
</p>
<p>afterwards take occasion to demonstrate.
</p>
<p>4th. John Ramsay was second son of the Dalhousie Fa-
</p>
<p>mily, not yet ennobled. He was one of James's Pages, and
</p>
<p>a great favourite. He may be said to have acted a prin-
</p>
<p>cipal part in the tragedy. From what we can now gather
</p>
<p>of his character, he must have been a bloody minded per-
</p>
<p>jured villain. By all accounts, he stabbed Alexander Ruth-
</p>
<p>ven, when kept down by the king, in such a posture, that
</p>
<p>lie neither could hurt another, nor defend himself. And
</p>
<p>the Earl received his death wound, from the same hand, in
</p>
<p>an unguarded moment. 'Tis not unlikely that Ramsay was
</p>
<p>fixed on for this service, as being an unfeeling soul, in a
</p>
<p>robust body. But besides his brutal conduct, in being the

</p>
<p>immediate executioner of so enormously wicked a decree,
</p>
<p>his deposition at the trial evinces him to have been, in every
</p>
<p>respect, a villain of the deepest dye, as will afterwards be
</p>
<p>made to appear.
</p>
<p>This mean, perjured, murderous villain, in reward of
</p>
<p>this piece of service, received an annuity of ^1000 Ster-
</p>
<p>ling, a large sum in those days, and had a gift of Melrose
</p>
<p>Abbey, with its princely revenues, expressly for this service.
</p>
<p>James, likewise, in 1606, created him Viscount Haddington^
</p>
<p>9-i
</p>
<p>smcl afterwards Earl of Holderness. To his paternal Coat
</p>
<p>of Arras, besides such variations as were necessary to dis-
</p>
<p>criminate his, from his brothers, was added a right hand
</p>
<p>holding a sword, peircing a man's heart, the point support-
</p>
<p>ing an Imperial crown; and the privelege of carrying the
</p>
<p>Sword of State before the Royal Family, to church, on the
</p>
<p>thanksgiving appointed to be annually observed on the 5th
</p>
<p>of August, was conferred on him, and his heirs. But his
</p>
<p>children vM died before himself, as did the observance of
</p>
<p>the thanksgiving, and at his own death his honours (if such
</p>
<p>his titles were) became extinct.
</p>
<p>5th. The Commendator of Inchaffray, was James, the
</p>
<p>i ccond son of David Lord Drummond. His mother hav-
</p>
<p>ing been a daughter of William Lord Ruthven, he was a
</p>
<p>near relation of Earl John; but to counterbalance that, he
</p>
<p>li ad been educated along with the king, and was a G entleman of
</p>
<p>his Bedchamber. He had got a grant of the Temporalities
</p>
<p>of the Abbey of Inchaffray, and the king, in gratitude for
</p>
<p>his conduct on the 5th. of August, and especially at the mock
</p>
<p>trial, erected the abbacy into a temporal Lordship, and
</p>
<p>rreated the Commendator Lord Madder ty, and bestowed
</p>
<p>;;ome other lands on him for the support of his dignity.
</p>
<p>It is very probable^ that there might have been some
</p>
<p>grudge between him and the house of Ruthven, as Alexan-
</p>
<p>der Ruthven of Forgan was Commendator of Inchaffray
</p>
<p>some years before this, when James assumed the regal au-
</p>
<p>thority. But be that as it will, his conduct in the forenoon
</p>
<p>t >f the 5th of August was very surprising, He had left Falk-
</p>
<p>land in the morning, to go to Inchaffray, he says, yet at
</p>
<p>half past eleven, the king and his companions found him
</p>
<p>loitering on the road at Strathmiglo on the way to Perth,
</p>
<p>when he instantly mounted, and made one of the par-
</p>
<p>ty at Gowry's, to dinner, and returned to Falkland in the
</p>
<p>evening. And all this without pretending to offer any rea-

</p>
<p>son for doing so.
</p>
<p>6th. The Abbot of Lindores was Patrick Leslie, .second
</p>
<p>?on to the Earl of Rothes. He was much in favour with
</p>
<p>James, who had made him one of the Gentlemen of the Bed-
</p>
<p>ch amber. It need scarcely be added, that James took him
</p>
<p>with him to Perth, on this occasion; and on the trial he
</p>
<p>swore point blank to every thing advanced by Lennox, with
</p>
<p>the addition of some other circumstances. But many a one
</p>
<p>will swear away a man's life, or reputation before a judge 3
</p>
<p>9J
</p>
<p>who lias not sufficient resolution, and abilities to take the
</p>
<p>one by force, or sully the other, when pains is taken to keep
</p>
<p>it bright. 'Tis not unlikely that this was the case with Lin-
</p>
<p>dores. We nowhere hear of him being engaged in the fray,
</p>
<p>but only looking at what was going on. However, even his
</p>
<p>countenance here, and support at the trial, deserved some
</p>
<p>reward ; and on this occasion, he was made Commendator
</p>
<p>of Lindores ; and on the 25th of December following, he
</p>
<p>was created Lord Lindores, the lands of that opulent Abbey
</p>
<p>being erected into a Temporality, in his favour. He was
</p>
<p>likewise appointed a Lord of Justiciary. But his male line
</p>
<p>failed. The honours fell to another branch of the Rothes
</p>
<p>family ; and are now either dormant or extinct. The lands
</p>
<p>are in other hands.
</p>
<p>7th. The evidence of John Graham of Urquhill, or Or-
</p>
<p>chil differs very little from some other of the witnesses.
</p>
<p>The most material point sworn to by him is, that when he,
</p>
<p>and some other of the kind's attendant** were following his
</p>
<p>Majesty and Alexander Ruthven up stairs, according to his
</p>
<p>Majesty's private instructions, in the forenoon on the way
</p>
<p>from Falkland ; Alexander desired them not to follow, and
</p>
<p>they obeyed. In another place, this sagacity of theirs will
</p>
<p>be taken notice of. It does not appear, what reward Or-
</p>
<p>chil got, for this particular service. But we know of no
</p>
<p>reason, why he should be passed by, in the distribution of
</p>
<p>the spoil, rather than some others, who were rewarded for
</p>
<p>services not more meritorious.
</p>
<p>8th. The next witness is John Graham of Balgowan,
</p>
<p>He deponed " conform to the Lord Duke in all things" and
</p>
<p>seems to have been extremely officious ; for that evening,
</p>
<p>before they left Perth, he produced a garter, which he pre-
</p>
<p>tended to have found among the Bent, or Litter, at the
</p>
<p>cheek of the door of the round, which (Bent or Rushes)
</p>
<p>served instead of a carpet in these days. On sight of the

</p>
<p>garter, he says King James declared it to be the identical
</p>
<p>one, with which Alexander Ruthven attempted to bind his
</p>
<p>hands. It was so easy to manage such a matter as this, that
</p>
<p>there seems but little superior merit, in being the agent
</p>
<p>But, if Balgowan's share of "the transaction displayed no
</p>
<p>uncommon mental abilities, he certainly made up for that,
</p>
<p>in some sort, by his diligence or bodily activity ; for he was
</p>
<p>in Edinburgh, before ten o'clock next morning, with an ac-
</p>
<p>count of the affair. But the pains which he took, was no
</p>
<p>96
</p>
<p>doubt meant, in the first place, for his Sovereign's benefit*
</p>
<p>and eventually for his own, yet he spoiled all in confirming
</p>
<p>the people of Edinburgh in their suspicion of James's guilt,
</p>
<p>by the difference they observed betwixt his own account and
</p>
<p>the others which were transmitted that same day. We
</p>
<p>know not what reward Balgowan received. We are not so
</p>
<p>much as informed if he received any. Perhaps, as his ser-
</p>
<p>vices were but trivial, and in one instance prejudicial, he
</p>
<p>might not be thought deserving of any. This we know,
</p>
<p>that several estates, once belonging to the Ruthven family,
</p>
<p>were lately attached to the estate of Balgowan.
</p>
<p>9th. The deposition of Mr John. Moncrieff of Piten-
</p>
<p>crieffi bother to William Moncrieff of that ilk, is the next
</p>
<p>on record. But his declaration consists of arguments not
</p>
<p>evidence. Instead of a witness, he turned advocate for the
</p>
<p>crown. And no wonder, for he was in a sad predicament.
</p>
<p>He was afraid of being reckoned a friend and accomplice
</p>
<p>of Gowrie's, as he dined with him on that very day in which
</p>
<p>it was given out that he made the attempt to murder the
</p>
<p>king ; and his brother Hugh was fugitate for not submit-
</p>
<p>ting to trial as being concerned in the Treason, consequent-
</p>
<p>ly the part which he had to act required great circumspec-
</p>
<p>tion. And when the day of trial came he took his ground
</p>
<p>decisively. He foresaw the folly of endeavouring to pur-
</p>
<p>suade the court of Gowrie's, and of course of his own in-
</p>
<p>nocence. Instead of that, he musters all the arguments
</p>
<p>lie could think of, in support of the charge against the two
</p>
<p>brothers ; and in particular^ relates that, in a conversation
</p>
<p>which he had with his brother Hugh, Hugh declared, that
</p>
<p>he was convinced of the guilt of the Ruthvens. Whether Pit-
</p>
<p>encrieffthen thought this a masterly contrivance or not, can-
</p>
<p>not now be known; but at this time it is easily seen through :
</p>
<p>and indeed it evidently had not all the effect on the court
</p>
<p>which he wished, as Hugh was convicted of treason, and

</p>
<p>only escaped execution by flight.
</p>
<p>10th. A declaration emitted at, and transmitted from
</p>
<p>Perth, by Andrew Roy or Ray, one of the magistrates of
</p>
<p>that town, is next inserted in the record. In our days this
</p>
<p>would be disregarded as extra-judicial, being made forty
</p>
<p>miles from the place of trial, and some weeks before the
</p>
<p>court had existence, but perhaps was regular enough in die
</p>
<p>end of the sixteenth century, when parties were allowed to
</p>
<p>be also witnesses and judges. Mr Roy being a magistrate, was
</p>
<p>97
</p>
<p>qualified to administer an oath. Accordingly, lie makes af-
</p>
<p>fidavit before himself that, inter alia, on the fifth of Au-
</p>
<p>gust, he saw the King put his head and arm forth of the
</p>
<p>window of the turret and cry murder ! treason ! help Earl
</p>
<p>of Mar. On which the deponent was so panick-struck,
</p>
<p>that instead of assisting the King, he ran- through the
</p>
<p>streets calling on the townsmen to go and relieve him ; and
</p>
<p>caused ring the bell, as if the town had been on fire ; and
</p>
<p>that, by these means, he succeeded in collecting a mob at the
</p>
<p>gate of the palace, as Go wry 's house was commonly called:
</p>
<p>and that the deponent, on finding the populace riotous, and
</p>
<p>likely to go to extremities, was commanded by His Majesty,
</p>
<p>to order them to disperse, and that he afterwards went to
</p>
<p>the market place, and by proclamation, commanded them
</p>
<p>to retire, each to his own lodging, under pain of treason.
</p>
<p>Mr Roy took care to authenticate this, as his evidence,
</p>
<p>for he procured the signature of Galloway the Chaplain, of
</p>
<p>the other three present, and one old baillie, of a clerk,
</p>
<p>perhaps a notary public, and of three burgesses, as witnesses,
</p>
<p>that this was his deposition. But, notwithstanding of all
</p>
<p>his punctilious observance of the lesser matters of the law,
</p>
<p>Roy's evidence will be found to affect the two brothers no
</p>
<p>farther than by proving, that the King and Alexander
</p>
<p>went out of the dining parlour together : and that Gowry
</p>
<p>told the lords, that the King had taken horse, and was a-
</p>
<p>way. The real case seems to be this, The assassins thought
</p>
<p>it would be necessary to impress the minds of the people of
</p>
<p>the town, with a belief of Gowry's treason, before they
</p>
<p>could come to the knowledge of the real state of the matter,
</p>
<p>and baillie Roy was the tool pitched on, for this purpose.
</p>
<p>We are not told whether the baillie ever got any recom-
</p>
<p>pense for this service. There were th^n but few places in
</p>

<p>appendage to the royal establishment of those days ; and as
</p>
<p>Andrew, if we may form a judgment of his character, from
</p>
<p>his own account of his behaviour on this occasion, was e-
</p>
<p>minently well qualified for this place, perhaps he might
</p>
<p>obtain it. We are inclined to indulge in this conjecture

<p>98
</p>
<p>11th. The evidence of Robert Christie, the porter, fol-
</p>
<p>lows next. It is principally designed for supporting these
</p>
<p>two parts of the story, viz. that in which Gowry is repre-
</p>
<p>sented as endeavouring to get rid of the courtiers, by de-
</p>
<p>claring, that the King was away home; and the other, where
</p>
<p>it is said that the Earl, accompanied by the two Ruthvens
</p>
<p>of Freeland, Eviot and Moncrieff, brothers to the proprie-
</p>
<p>tors of Balhousie and Moncrieff and his own servant
</p>
<p>Cranston, went altogether, armed, up to the apartment
</p>
<p>where the bustle was. And to both circumstances he swears
</p>
<p>in the most unqualified manner.
</p>
<p>This Witness's deposition is liable to great suspicion:
</p>
<p>therefore, a remarkable artifice is resorted to, in support
</p>
<p>of it. Lennox had sworn, that he saw a joist brought by
</p>
<p>some persons into the court ; Christie, without whose know-
</p>
<p>ledge it could not have been brought in, saw nothing of it.
</p>
<p>As much is meant by this, as if it had been said, " See this
</p>
<p>man's integrity, he'll not swear a falsehood to support any
</p>
<p>man's evidence." If he was instructed what to depone,
</p>
<p>why was he not directed to swear to the joist, as well as to
</p>
<p>other circumstances ? But an answer is at hand to this
</p>
<p>question. The joist's being brought in was a matter of no
</p>
<p>consequence whatever : the rest of his evidence was of the
</p>
<p>utmost importance in the cause.
</p>
<p>Christie had only been a few weeks in Gowry's service,
</p>
<p>and seems not to have been much attached to his interest.
</p>
<p>And as the plot required, that the Earl should try to per-
</p>
<p>suade James's followers that he was off to Falkland, and as
</p>
<p>that part of the tragedy could not properly be performed
</p>
<p>without the porter acting a part in it, it was necessary to
</p>
<p>bribe Christie into compliance. What the extent of his re-
</p>
<p>ward was, we pretend not to know ; but one thing is on re-
</p>
<p>cord, David Murray continued him in his employ : no tri-
</p>
<p>vial consideration in the then state of Society.

</p>
<p>12th. Blair, younger of Balthayock, depones next. He
</p>
<p>does not pretend to have seen Gowry and his armed at-
</p>
<p>tendants pass up the stairs, but he saw the two brothers of
</p>
<p>Forgan and Flugh Moncrieff, all armed, come down, which
</p>
<p>certainly implied, that they had gone up. He likewise saw
</p>
<p>the joist brought into the court, and set up against the wall.
</p>
<p>So that in this deposition, we still have a semblance of im-
</p>
<p>partiality. Balthayock was appointed provost of Perth, on
</p>
<p>the death of Gowry, till the ensuing election at Michael-
</p>
<p>99
</p>
<p>mas) and then, by a fresh order, he was appointed to con*
</p>
<p>tinue, for the following year.
</p>
<p>13th. Prior Hay is next examined. He depones, that
</p>
<p>having occasion to be in the Earl's house, on the 5th of
</p>
<p>August, he saw Henderson arrive from Falkland ; and that
</p>
<p>after the Earl had spoken with Henderson, he (the Earl)
</p>
<p>told Hay, that he had not leisure to transact business with
</p>
<p>him that day. He likewise confirms Lennox's evidence in
</p>
<p>every thing, after their arrival at Perth.
</p>
<p>This witness was George Hay of Netherlief, second son
</p>
<p>of Sir Patrick Hay of Megginch, baillie of Errol, a branch
</p>
<p>of the family of Errol. He was bred at Doway, under his
</p>
<p>uncle Edmund Hay, a Jesuit, and professor of law, a pesti-
</p>
<p>ferous emissary, who was repeatedly sent out of Scotland, on
</p>
<p>account of his endeavours to disseminate what were then per-
</p>
<p>nicious tenents ; he having, besides seducing the Errol fa-
</p>
<p>mily, endeavoured to stir up the English Papists to effect
</p>
<p>a rising, so as to favour the Spanish invasion in 1588, for
</p>
<p>which, he was also imprisoned in the tower of London.
</p>
<p>George returned to Scotland, when about twenty-two years
</p>
<p>of age ; at which time, James began to heap favours upon
</p>
<p>him. He was at first a gentleman pensioner; then gentle-
</p>
<p>man of the Bedchamber. In 1598, the king bestowed on
</p>
<p>him the Carthusian Priory of Perth, the church of Errol,.
</p>
<p>and a vote in parliament, or peerage. But the revenues
</p>
<p>of this once opulent monastery having been much dilapi-
</p>
<p>dated by Prior Foreman at the Reformation, Hay found
</p>
<p>them inadequate to support the dignity of a Lord : and
</p>
<p>therefore he returned that honour to the king.
</p>
<p>We are told that Hay had but a small share of learn-
</p>
<p>ing ; but a great deal of address and duplicity. As he was
</p>
<p>well inclined towards Popery, he had the interest of thai:
</p>
<p>faction at court : which circumstance tended also not a little
</p>
<p>to ingratiate him with James and Charles I. Accordingly

<p>he was made Clerk-register in 1616, Chancellor, in 1622,
</p>
<p>Viscount Dupplin, and Lord Hay of Kinfauns in 1627 ?
</p>
<p>and Earl of Kinnoul in 1633, and had a lease of the duties of
</p>
<p>the Earldom of Orkney for 40,000 marks. All this time,
</p>
<p>he took care not to receive a name et prceteria nihil. He
</p>
<p>had the address to realize a large fortune, considering his
</p>
<p>small beginning. Dupplin, Aberdalgy, Kinnoul, Kinfauns,
</p>
<p>Seggieden, Dunineld, and several other baronies were either
</p>
<p>purchased by him, or granted to him. His heirs male be-

</p>
<p>came extinct in 1709, and his honours and estate fell ttf
</p>
<p>Thomas Hay of Balhoiisie, descended of Patrick, the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing witness, and his elder brother.
</p>
<p>Little credit is due to the testimony of one who was both
</p>
<p>a lawyer, a Jesuit, and a retainer in the court of James VI.
</p>
<p>in this cause, seeing the Ruthven family were the chief of
</p>
<p>the opposite party in Scotland, at that time.
</p>
<p>14th His brother Peter confirmed his deposition "in
</p>
<p>all things."
</p>
<p>1 5th. The next witness is Robert Graham of Thorink.
</p>
<p>He seems not to have been at Falkland, as he simply con-
</p>
<p>firms Lennox's deposition, as far as it relates to what hap-
</p>
<p>pened at Perth.
</p>
<p>1 6th. Oliver Young, one of the magistrates of Perth, h
</p>
<p>next brought forward. This witness was in Gowry's house
</p>
<p>that day, perhaps under the same pretence with baillie Roy,
</p>
<p>namely, to see the king. 'Tis probable they were desired
</p>
<p>to be in the way, in case of any disturbance taking place :
</p>
<p>for it is not likely, that the magistrates of the second city
</p>
<p>in the kingdom, were so idle as to enter Gowry's house,
</p>
<p>merely to stare at the king eating his dinner, especially as
</p>
<p>he had dined in that same house an hundred times before.
</p>
<p>This witness saw the king and Alexander pass up the stairs,
</p>
<p>and afterwards, saw Hugh Moncrieff and Hary Ruthven,
</p>
<p>the one with a bloody face, the other armed, as if they had
</p>
<p>been at the fight.
</p>
<p>This witness was continued oldest baillie, (chief resident
</p>
<p>magistrate) for several successive j-ears, after this : the first
</p>
<p>of which was by direction of the king.
</p>
<p>17th. James Drummond of Pitcairns* is the next wit-
</p>
<p>ness. His evidence is of little consequence.
</p>
<p>18th. William Rynd the butcher, then depones, that
</p>
<p>he saw Eviot and Moncrieff in the court, both bloody, and
</p>
<p>having drawn swords in their hands.

</p>
<p>19th. A burgher of the town is next brought forward,
</p>
<p>to the two foregoing depositions.
</p>
<p>20th. Wilson, servant to James Erskin, then appears*
</p>
<p>He confirms Alexander Erskin's evidence. This was one
</p>
<p>of the four who passed up the back stair, and was present
</p>
<p>at the death of both the brothers. What other reward he
</p>
<p>got, we know not ; but we are told, that the king, on this
</p>
<p>occasion, made him a gentleman ; which, considering the
</p>
<p>quality of the raw material, was certainly a masterly per-
</p>
<p>101
</p>
<p>formance. The metamorphosing of a cut-throat scoundrel
</p>
<p>into a gentleman, is indeed one of the artes jper^ditce.
</p>
<p>The king may make a belted knight
</p>
<p>A marquis, duke and a' that ;
</p>
<p>An honest man's aboon his might ;
</p>
<p>Guid faith he manna fa' that.
</p>
<p>21st. David Rynd, another butcher, saw Alexander
</p>
<p>Ruthven of Forgan in the tumult.
</p>
<p>22d. Gilbert Hutcheson confirms this. Of these twa
</p>
<p>we know nothing.
</p>
<p>23d. John Murray of Arkney, is next. Probably he is
</p>
<p>the John Murray, servant to Tullibardine, who was wound-
</p>
<p>ed. He says, he came to St Johnston after dinner ; but it
</p>
<p>was not long after dinner-time, as he says he heard the king
</p>
<p>call from the window for help ; and saw Earl Gowry in the
</p>
<p>close with a helmet and two swords. This witness was of
</p>
<p>an athletic form of body, and very possibly was sent by
</p>
<p>the Murrays, to assist in case of need, for it does not ap-
</p>
<p>pear that he had any other business in Gowry's court,
</p>
<p>where he was before the disturbance arose.
</p>
<p>24-th. Thomas Birrel's evidence only corroborates that
</p>
<p>of some others, and seems particularly levelled at the For-
</p>
<p>gan family, Hugh MoncriefF, and Thomas Cranston.
</p>
<p>25th. Forrest, a tradesman in Perth, is next examined.
</p>
<p>He only says, that he saw George Craigengelt and another
</p>
<p>servant in the court, with drawn swords.
</p>
<p>26th. Robertson the notary is then examined. He says,
</p>
<p>that on seeing Gowry standing in the court, with his hel-
</p>
<p>met on his head, and a drawn sword in each hand, accom-
</p>
<p>panied by seven or eight other persons, all unknown to
</p>
<p>him, and it appears all unarmed, he was so frightened that
</p>
<p>he run off.
</p>
<p>27th  30th. The four following witnesses are James's
</p>
<p>domestics. One of them porter, another keeper of the ale-

</p>
<p>cellar, none of which would, in all liklihood, have followed
</p>
<p>the king to Perth, on an ordinary occasion ; but very pro-
</p>
<p>bably were desperadoes, selected for this particular pur-
</p>
<p>pose, but whose personal assistance was not needed, as the
</p>
<p>brothers being taken unprepared made but little resistance.
</p>
<p>All the four swear point blank to every thing that Lennox
</p>
<p>had said.
</p>
<p>31st. One Peebles, another inhabitant of Perth, is the
</p>
<p>last witness examined. He relates, that he was in his own
</p>
<p>house opposite to Gowry's, when the bell rang; and that
</p>
<p>his mother then locked him in. He, however, saw Gowry
</p>
<p>enter the court with the two swords, and saw Alexander
</p>
<p>Ruthven, Patrick Eviot, and his servant, and Hugh Mon-
</p>
<p>crieff come from the house.
</p>
<p>Such a set of witnesses was well calculated for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose in hand ; and it is far from improbable, that the ma-
</p>
<p>jority of the judges, (by which is meant the Lords of the
</p>
<p>Articles, as they were in effect the sole judges) would be of
</p>
<p>the like stamp. We know for certain, that Montrose the
</p>
<p>chancellor, (though once married to a sister of Gowry's)
</p>
<p>was considered by the Ruthven family as their enemy : for
</p>
<p>when the Countess was told, that the attempt to seize the
</p>
<p>two younger brothers the next evening, after the death of
</p>
<p>the two elder ones, was with the design of committing them
</p>
<p>to the chancellor's charge, she exclaimed, Ah ! false traitor,
</p>
<p>shall my bairns be put into his clutches ? Lennox and Mar,
</p>
<p>other two of the Lords of the Articles, were parties in the
</p>
<p>cause ; and had Gowry and his brother been brought in,
</p>
<p>not Guilty, these ought to have been hanged, as accom-
</p>
<p>plices in their murder. Several others of the Lords, as
</p>
<p>Errol and Marrischal were professed Papists ; and the six
</p>
<p>church dignitaries could not be supposed friendly to the
</p>
<p>cause of Presbytery, nor to any who took so decided a part
</p>
<p>in supporting it as the Ruthven family, especially Earl
</p>
<p>John, did. #
</p>
<p>But of all the ruffians, who were concerned in this dia-
</p>
<p>bolical transaction, by much the most redoubtable was King
</p>
<p>James the VI. Although it was the fortune of this wretch
</p>
<p>to reign over several millions of his fellow creatures, yet a
</p>
<p>character so shamefully base, and enormously wicked, is
</p>
<p>seldom called to act on the stage of life. His mean grovel-
</p>
<p>ling nature manifested itself on a thousand occasions, but
</p>
<p>on none more strikingly, than in his submitting to be the

<p>pensioner of Queen Elizabeth, rather than assume the re-
</p>
<p>solution of shaking off his childish attachment to favourites,
</p>
<p>whose necessities he accommodated, whose extravagance he
</p>
<p>supported, and whose avarice he gratified, with a profusion
</p>
<p>unparalleled, in so poor a prince. And when the pension,
</p>
<p>and his proper income, were together inadequate to his ex-
</p>
<p>penditure, he scrupled not to murder, to rob and to beg.
</p>

</p>
<p>ty being unrestrained by any proper sense of the dignity of
</p>
<p>his station.

<p>" The needy man,  - 
</p>
<p>Is he, whom tempting fiends would pitch upon,
</p>
<p>To do such deeds, as make the prosperous men
</p>
<p>Lift up their hands, and wonder who could do them.
</p>
<p>And such a man was" James.
</p>
<p>The Gowry estate was divided amongst James's court-
</p>
<p>iers, and although few or none in the kingdom were equal
</p>
<p>to it in value, it was insufficient for their wants, as England
</p>
<p>felt to her cost, upon his accession to that throne, two or
</p>
<p>three years afterwards.
</p>
<p>Dissimulation and hypocrisy are qualifications very re-
</p>
<p>quisite in a villain ; and James possessed both in an eminent
</p>
<p>degree. It is now known, that his domestic character was
</p>
<p>one of the most vicious, and disgraceful, that can possibly
</p>
<p>be conceived ; and yet in public, he occasionally made great
</p>
<p>outward show of religion : for however he shifted from one
</p>
<p>system of polemics to another, just as he thought most suit-
</p>
<p>able for his purpose, his profession of piety shone forth on eve-
</p>
<p>ry proper occasion, and even sometimes on improper ones, e.g.
</p>
<p>His falling down on his knees, and formally thanking God
</p>
<p>for his deliverance, along with his attendants, so soon as he
</p>
<p>had dispatched Gowry and his brother, without taking the
</p>
<p>precaution, of securing themselves from the other conspi-
</p>
<p>rators, who, if Gowry was a traitor, they had reason to
</p>
<p>* It was not uncommon for James to write to some of his own subjects,
</p>
<p>in a stile something betwixt the demand of a robber and the supplication of a
</p>
<p>beggar, requesting such trifles as a pair of fowls, if he meant to make a feast,
</p>
<p>or the loan of a pair of breeches if he wished to appear finer than the state of
</p>
<p>his wardrobe enabled him to be.
</p>
<p>In a letter from Sir Ralph Sadler to Queen Elizabeth, at the time he had
</p>
<p>the custody of Mary Queen of Scots, he says " she (Mary), speaking of James,

<p>folkes about him) as he hath oft sent to her for money to buy himself clothes

</p>
<p>out of hers out of France, when she could evil spare it. And that the

<p>this ignominious soul, the sovereign of three kingdoms, rendered himself

</p>
<p>suppose, were in waiting. James seems to have even piqued
</p>
<p>himself on his being an adept in dissimulation : for it is said
</p>
<p>to have been a maxim of his, That he that knew not how to
</p>
<p>dissemble, knew not how to reign. Theory which he constant-
</p>
<p>ly practised, For whenever he found himself any way gra-
</p>
<p>velled by his incapacity for his office, (which* God knows,
</p>
<p>was often enough), he always had recourse to some base
</p>
<p>trick or other for extricating himself. When detected in a
</p>
<p>correspondence with the Pope, for the purpose of renewing
</p>
<p>the connection of these kingdoms with the see of Rome,
</p>
<p>James pretended ignorance of the transaction, accounting
</p>
<p>for it by asserting that Elphinstone his secretary had sur-
</p>
<p>reptitiously procured his (the king's) signature to the letter.
</p>
<p>He even prevailed on that Sycophant to acknowledge the
</p>
<p>fact, and submit to a trial for the treason. The issue of all
</p>
<p>which was, that he was condemned and forfeited, but, after
</p>
<p>a short imprisonment, was pardoned, and ennobled.
</p>
<p>Again, jealousy of the " Bonny Earl of Moray" induced
</p>
<p>James to have him taken out of the way. That enterprise
</p>
<p>was committed to the Earl of Huntly ; who executed it in
</p>
<p>a very satisfactory manner, by burning Moray's house pf
</p>
<p>Dunnibirslc, and butchering himself and some of his friends
</p>
<p>in their attempt to escape. Huntly then stopped in Inver-
</p>
<p>keithing, and dispatched one of his relations, Gordon of
</p>
<p>Bucky, to James with an account of their success : but to
</p>
<p>:.ave appearances, it was thought proper for him to pass to
</p>
<p>the north country, as if to elude justice : and still the better
</p>
<p>to blind the world, a relation of Huntly's, one captain Gor-
</p>
<p>don, being wounded in the scuffle, and so unable to escape,
</p>
<p>was hanged next day. But all to no purpose. Every bo-
</p>
<p>dy saw through the whole of it. And so great was the pub-
</p>
<p>lic discontent and clamour, that James thought prudent to
</p>
<p>remove his court to Glasgow, till such time as the fer-
</p>
<p>ment should subside ; and directed Huntly to enter into con-

</p>
<p>iincment in Blackness Castle : whence he was liberated in a
</p>
<p>few days on bail. Moray's friends did every thing in their
</p>
<p>power to have Huntly brought to justice, and becoming at
</p>
<p>length exasperated by such bare-faced collusion, they re-
</p>
<p>solved to do what in those days was reckoned justice to
</p>
<p>themselves ; they made inroads into Huntly's estates, burn-
</p>
<p>ing and carrying off the moveables and slaying his vassals.
</p>
<p>He did not fail to retaliate. But the Earl of Angus went
</p>
<p>north and quelled these disturbances. The Kirk excom-
</p>
<p>105
</p>
<p>communicated Huntly for the murder at Dumiibirsle, but
</p>
<p>no account of the matter was ever exacted by the civil power.
</p>
<p>And Huntly boasted that James durst not push him on that
</p>
<p>affair, as he had his warrant, for what he did, in his pocket
</p>
<p>securing him from punishment, which was certainly no way
</p>
<p>improbable, if we consider, that in 1596 his majesty, to bar

<p>accidents, gave him a formal pardon, and in 1598 created
</p>
<p>him Marquis.
</p>
<p>James's hypocrisy, and mean dissimulation appear very
</p>
<p>strikingly, in his religious professions; as he adhered
</p>
<p>sometimes to one opinion, sometimes to another ; and these
</p>
<p>of principles quite different. In the General Assembly of
</p>
<p>the Kirk of Scotland held at Edinburgh, August 4th, 1590,
</p>
<p>he rose, and, with bare head, uplifted hands, and eyes direct-
</p>
<p>ed towards heaven, thanked God that " He was born in
</p>
<p>a time when the light of God's word shone clearly forth, ec-
</p>
<p>lipsed neither with the mists of ignorance nor the false lights
</p>
<p>of superstition ;" and " blessed God that he had honoured
</p>
<p>him to be the king over such a Kirk, the sincerest Kirk in the
</p>
<p>world."  " The service of our neighbouring Kirk of Eng-
</p>
<p>land is but an ill said Mass in English. They want nothing
</p>
<p>of the Mass but the Liftings. I charge you, my good mi-
</p>
<p>nisters, doctors, elders, and nobles, stand to your purity >
</p>
<p>and exhort the people to do the same. And I, forsooth, so
</p>
<p>long as life and crown be left me, shall maintain the same
</p>
<p>against all deadly." And on different occasions he used si-
</p>
<p>milar language.
</p>
<p>But in his advice to his son Henry, and on other occa-
</p>
<p>sions after he ascended the English Throne, when he dared
</p>
<p>avow his thoughts, he used very different, and very unbe-
</p>
<p>coming language towards the Puritans. And in answer to
</p>
<p>Bellarmine, (who, judging from his behaviour whilst only
</p>
<p>King of Scotland) had charged him with being a Puritan,
</p>
<p>he said, " I wonder with what brazen face this Answerer

</p>
<p>(Bellarmine) could say that I was a Puritan. 1 that, in
</p>
<p>my book to my son, speak ten times more bitterly of them
</p>
<p>than of Papists; having affixed to my second edition, a long
</p>
<p>Apologetic Preface, in odium Puritanorum." And no
</p>
<p>sooner was he seated on the English Throne, than he takes
</p>
<p>occasion to inform the people of that country, that his o-
</p>
<p>pinion differed widely from what he once professed. For
</p>
<p>on the first day of his first Parliament in England, in his
</p>
<p>speech from the throne, he told them that the sect of the
</p>
<p>O
</p>
<p>106
</p>
<p>Puritans was not to be suffered in any well-governed Com-
</p>
<p>monwealth: and that the Church of Rome was our Mo-
</p>
<p>ther Church, although defiled with some corruptions : that
</p>
<p>he would be content to meet those of the Roman Church
</p>
<p>mid-way: and wished from his heart, that it would please
</p>
<p>God, to make him one of the Instruments of such a General
</p>
<p>Union of Religion.
</p>
<p>In confirmation of all this, in a few years he introduced
</p>
<p>the doctrine and ceremonies of the English Church into
</p>
<p>Scotland, after a violent struggle, in which numbers of his
</p>
<p>subjects were ruined and forced into exile. But there is
</p>
<p>good ground for supposing that this was only a preparatory
</p>
<p>step to the introduction of the Romish Religion, as we know,
</p>
<p>that he once and again made advances to the Pope for that
</p>
<p>purpose: once through the medium of Secretary Elphinston,
</p>
<p>when he offered to become Catholic, and desired His Holi-
</p>
<p>ness to create some Scotchman a Cardinal, that business
</p>
<p>might be transacted betwixt them with the greater facility :
</p>
<p>again, by Lord Ogilby, making a similar application*.
</p>
<p>Occasionally too, he shifted from Calvinism to Armini-
</p>
<p>anism. On one of these occasions, he declared Arminius
</p>
<p>" a seditious and heretical preacher,  and an enemy to
</p>
<p>God ;" and even prevailed on the States General to perse-
</p>
<p>cute the Arminiatik, Yet he afterwards tells the States, that
</p>
<p>it did not appear to him (James) that Arminius's arguments
</p>
<p>were inconsistent with the Christian faith. And in 1622,
</p>
<p>the Bishops of England were required to see that no preacher
</p>
<p>do henceforth presume to preach of predestination, election,
</p>
<p>reprobation, and like Calvinistical doctrines. And several
</p>
<p>professed Arminians, as Laud, Cobet, and Howson, were
</p>
<p>made bishops by him.
</p>
<p>Cruelty and revenge formed another very prominent fea-
</p>
<p>ture in James's character. Many shocking instances of
</p>
<p>which are handed down to us : one or two of which will be

<p>sufficient for specimens.
</p>
<p>In 1598, an Englishman, of the name of Valentine
</p>
<p>Thomas, had traduced James's character, by alleging that
</p>
<p>he designed to destroy Queen Elizabeth. As Thomas
</p>
<p>was not then his subject, James was under the necessity of
</p>
<p>bearino- the afront unrevenged, till he should become King
</p>
<p>of England. But a month did not elapse after that event
</p>
<p>before he had the man hanged.

</p>
<p>Some years after James ascended the English Throne,
</p>
<p>the people of that nation complained much*, of their coun-
</p>
<p>try being over-run with James's followers ; who were often
</p>
<p>appointed to offices, for the discharge of the duties of which
</p>
<p>they were incapable, and of whose emoluments they were
</p>
<p>Unworthy. In 1618, a Mr Thomas Ross wrote and affixed
</p>
<p>to the door of St Mary's, Oxford, a paper reflecting on the
</p>
<p>Scotch, (although himself a Scotchman) asserting, that they
</p>
<p>should all be sent from court, except the King, his children,
</p>
<p>and a few others. For this, Ross was indicted. He owned
</p>
<p>the fact; but alleged, that he did it in a frolic, for which
</p>
<p>he was sorry ; and, agreeable to a practice of these times,
</p>
<p>put himself in the King's will. James, by a special warrant,
</p>
<p>caused first his hand and then his head to be struck off, and
</p>
<p>the one to be fixed on the Netherbow and the other on the
</p>
<p>West-port of Edinburgh.
</p>
<p>One of the town-officers of Edinburgh having poinded
</p>
<p>(distrained in English law) some furniture, carried it, agree-
</p>
<p>able to law, to the cross to be apprised. The gallows stood
</p>
<p>at the cross, and being in these days much used, was never
</p>
<p>taken down. Among the poinded goods, were two pictures,
</p>
<p>one of James, the other of Queen Ann. The officer, whilst
</p>
<p>going on with the business, happened, for conveniency, to
</p>
<p>hang these on nails which Were in the uprights of the gal-
</p>
<p>lows. James got notice of this indignity done to the Lord's
</p>
<p>Anointed, on which he caused the officer be hanged.
</p>
<p>James gave another strong instance of inhumanity in
</p>
<p>his treatment of William Earl of Gowry. The Earl had
</p>
<p>been pardoned for the share he had in the Raid of Ruthven.
</p>
<p>But James afterwards ordered him into exile in a summary
</p>
<p>manner; and upon Gowry's hesitating to obey, he was seized
</p>
<p>and tried as a traitor* in such a manner, as set all decency
</p>
<p>at defiance. Mr John Graham, a most unconscionable vil-
</p>
<p>lain, acted as Justice-General. James Edmonstone of Dun-

<p>treath was one of his assessors, a wretch, who afterwards
</p>
<p>swore away the lives of two gentlemen, his acquaintances :
</p>
<p>and Sir John Gordon of Lochinvar was another, to whom
</p>
<p>the Earl objected on account of his relation to some of his
</p>
<p>J 02
</p>
<p>* No fewer than four Acts of Parliament were passed in the reign of James?
</p>
<p>VI. for punishing those who " slandered the King" and " his progenitors,"
</p>
<p>with " death and confiscation." Hutchinson's Justice, book ii. chap. i. No
</p>
<p>bad indication of the estimation in which his " Majesty's sanctified person"
</p>
<p>(See Dedication to the Bible) and government was held by his loving subjects
</p>
<p>108
</p>
<p>enemies: but that objection was repelled, and thereby a
</p>
<p>majority of the bench secured, in favour of government.
</p>
<p>No less attention was paid to have a Jury packed. Arran
</p>
<p>himself made one, and is said to have promised his colleagues
</p>
<p>a share of the prey, on their assisting to run down Gowry*.
</p>
<p>Accordingly his pardon was reversed, and he was found
</p>
<p>guilty of treason. He wrote to the King, craving a respite,
</p>
<p>and declaring that he had no intention of injuring his Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty, either in person or government, but only wished to
</p>
<p>secure his own affairs from ruin. The only answer he re-
</p>
<p>ceived was to be carried out to the street of Stirling that
</p>
<p>same afternoon in which he was tried, May 2, 1584, and
</p>
<p>there beheaded. James was then only eighteen years of age,
</p>
<p>a time of life, when the generous feelings are supposed to
</p>
<p>have most influence on the actions.
</p>
<p>In 1584, David Home of Argathy, and Patrick his bro-
</p>
<p>ther, were condemned and hanged for a similar offence, viz,
</p>
<p>corresponding with the banished Lords. Spottiswood says,
</p>
<p>that only one or two letters were exchanged with the Com-
</p>
<p>mendator of Dryburgh, then in Ireland, relative to some
</p>
<p>private accounts, unsettled at the time of the commendator's
</p>
<p>leaving the country. But that proved sufficient.
</p>
<p>The tragical deaths of two respectable gentlemen, Messrs.
</p>
<p>John Cunningham of Drumquhasil, and Malcolm Douglas
</p>
<p>of Mains ; in which James's cunning makes a conspicuous
</p>
<p>figure, being only equalled by his cruelty; is one of the most
</p>
<p>hellish transactions we have on record.
</p>
<p>These two gentlemen were very obnoxious to the King
</p>
<p>and his minions, because of their opposition to the oppres-
</p>
<p>sions and cruelties exercised by the then government. As
</p>
<p>it was found impracticable to bias their resolute and inde-
</p>
<p>pendent minds, it became necessary to get rid of them one
</p>
<p>way or other, especially as they were gentlemen of some
</p>
<p>consideration. To effectuate that, the following method

</p>
<p>was adopted. One Robert Hamilton of Inchmahan was-
</p>
<p>pitched on to accuse them of having conspired to intercept
</p>
<p>the King whilst hunting, and either kill him presently, or
</p>
<p>carry him to the Merse, or some one of the Western Islands,,
</p>
<p>and detain him in some strong-hold there, till those noble-

<p>* The Master of Oliphant was another, between whom and Lord Ruthven,.
</p>
<p>a quarrel had taken place a year before, in which some blood was shed. Both
</p>
<p>Parties were charged to appear before the King and Council. It does not ap-
</p>
<p>pear that matters were made up betwixt them at Gowry's death.
</p>
<p>109
</p>
<p>men in exile for the Raid of Ruthven might come home and
</p>
<p>receive him. A James Edmonstone of Duntreath was like-
</p>
<p>wise prevailed on to take a share of the guilt, and confess
</p>
<p>that he had received letters from Angus and the other re-
</p>
<p>fugees, instigating him to take a principal concern in the
</p>
<p>plot: and that he engaged Douglas and Cunningham in the
</p>
<p>enterprize. This declaration he made in a judicial manner,
</p>
<p>stating the times and places of their meetings, upon privately
</p>
<p>receiving promise of pardon. The other two denied all
</p>
<p>knowledge of any such transaction; Mains in particular
</p>
<p>made a very able defence, dwelling particularly upon the
</p>
<p>improbability that any but madmen would make such an
</p>
<p>attempt, without some other means than they possessed : in-
</p>
<p>somuch that Spottiswood says, all present were satisfied of
</p>
<p>the falsity of the accusation. But it was all to no purpose-
</p>
<p>All the three were condemned, and Mains and Drumquhasil
</p>
<p>hanged next day, Feb. 10, 1584, on the street of Edinburgh*
</p>
<p>Duntreath was pardoned. A favour which he deserved but
</p>
<p>ill, for when Arran's party lost the power, next year, he
</p>
<p>owned that, as far as he knew, there was no foundation for
</p>
<p>any thing that he had sworn against the two gentlemen ; but
</p>
<p>that the whole was a fabrication given him by the King's
</p>
<p>servants, and to which he swore to please His Majesty.
</p>
<p>The least of these instances is more than sufficient to e-
</p>
<p>stablish the treacherous disposition of James. Many more
</p>
<p>might be adduced, among which, his treatment of Sir Wal-
</p>
<p>ter Raleigh is not the least remarkable : but we forbear to
</p>
<p>enlarge farther on this point.
</p>
<p>Another remarkable trait in James's character, and one
</p>
<p>which occasioned himself and his subjects much trouble in
</p>
<p>his lifetime, and which cost his son his life, and at last
</p>
<p>brought the house of Stewart to ruin, was his high notions
</p>
<p>of regal power, and extravagant respect for the office. In
</p>
<p>his advice to Prince Henry, he says, " Kings are account-

</p>
<p>able to God only." And in another performance, The Trew
</p>
<p>Law of Monarchy, he informs us, that " the King is above
</p>
<p>the law, and he is not bound thereto but of his good-will,
</p>
<p>and for good example giving to his subjects." We have
</p>
<p>already shewn that James did not fail to put this doctrine
</p>
<p>into practice.
</p>
<p>Biographers have assured us, and late discoveries have
</p>
<p>demonstrated the truth of it, that his private character was
</p>
<p>even disgraceful to human nature, but as that is a poiFt
</p>
<p>110
</p>
<p>which is rather foreign to our purpose, we forbear to say
</p>
<p>more on that subject, than merely to observe, that if true
</p>
<p>it shews, that religion could have no restraint on his con-
</p>
<p>duct. And indeed any further detail of the abhorrent traits
</p>
<p>of James's character would be superfluous : as every candid
</p>
<p>mind will admit, that the foregoing sufficiently indicate him
</p>
<p>to have been capable of the grossest enormities. The man
</p>
<p>who is destitute of religion, probity, and humanity, wants
</p>
<p>only personal courage to fit him for an assassin. James
</p>
<p>was to be sure deficient in that, but " money answereth all
</p>
<p>things :" and we find that he kept about him needy despe-
</p>
<p>radoes, ready to engage in any, even the most hellish en-
</p>
<p>terprize, for hire.
</p>
<p>We are now, in the fifth and last place, to endeavour
</p>
<p>to discover, which of the four theories that have been pro-
</p>
<p>posed, for solving this difficulty, is the most probable.
</p>
<p>The first to be taken notice of may be said to be Prin-
</p>
<p>cipal Robertson's.
</p>
<p>It supposes a plot concerted betwixt Queen Elizabeth of
</p>
<p>England, and the Earl of Gowry, for seizing King James's:
</p>
<p>person, and delivering him up to her, that he might be
</p>
<p>wholly under her controul; and that Gowry invited the
</p>
<p>King to his house at Perth on the fifth of August, 1600, for
</p>
<p>this purpose.
</p>
<p>In support of this, we are told that, during the Earl's
</p>
<p>residence in Paris, on his way home from Italy, he had
</p>
<p>contracted an intimacy with Sir Henry Neville, Queen E-
</p>
<p>Jizabeth's ambassador at that court. And that, on his return
</p>
<p>to England, she herself paid him great respect. " She"
</p>
<p>continues the same author " had formerly kept him (King
</p>
<p>James) in dependence, sometimes by soothing himself with
</p>
<p>promises, sometimes by bribing his ministers or favourites,
</p>
<p>sometimes by encouraging and assisting the clergy in their
</p>
<p>seditious practices, or the turbulent barons in their ambi-

</p>
<p>tious and factious schemes; but qf late, James had inclined
</p>
<p>to court the good will of the Catholic Princes on the conti-
</p>
<p>nent, and had entered into secret negotiations with some of
</p>
<p>Elizabeth's English subjects, for the purpose of more cer-
</p>
<p>tainly securing his succession to her throne, at her death.
</p>
<p>To guard herself against the ill effects of these intrigues,
</p>
<p>Ill
</p>
<p>she became desirous of having possession of James's person.
</p>
<p>And for this purpose, entered into a combination with Gow-
</p>
<p>ry, on his return home. He, we are told, was the fittest
</p>
<p>of all the Scotch nobles for this purpose, being opulent,
</p>
<p>powerful, and popular; and descended of ancestors attached
</p>
<p>to the English interest. We are further informed that, a-
</p>
<p>bout the same time, a strange vessel was observed hovering
</p>
<p>off the mouth of the Forth, it is presumed, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of receiving James on board, whenever Gowry could appre*
</p>
<p>hend him.
</p>
<p>But this hypothesis is combated by very powerful objec-
</p>
<p>tions. Gowry's opulence, power, or popularity could little
</p>
<p>avail him in the present instance ; as it was proved, as fully
</p>
<p>as a negative proposition can be proved, that, excepting his
</p>
<p>brother, he had not a single accomplice. Neither are we
</p>
<p>told who the person was who saw the cruizer. Besides
</p>
<p>these, Perth is fifteen miles farther off, in a straight line
</p>
<p>from the mouth of the Forth, than Falkland. Gowry's
</p>
<p>house stood in a populous town, which at that time, was
</p>
<p>surrounded by a high wall with gates : and supposing that
</p>
<p>James had by some means been carried prisoner without
</p>
<p>the walls of Perth, with the view of being put aboard a vessel
</p>
<p>in the Forth, there must have been in waiting, either a
</p>
<p>sufficient escort of horsemen, to hurry him to the coast
</p>
<p>merely by speed, or an army of several thousand armed men,
</p>
<p>who were able to resist the country, through which he had
</p>
<p>to pass, (a district at that time by far the most populous of
</p>
<p>any in Scotland), and the distance not less than forty miles.
</p>
<p>But notwithstanding that every endeavour was made to
</p>
<p>procure all possible information of this nature, not a single
</p>
<p>person, either on foot or horseback, was ever heard of a*
</p>
<p>being aDotted to this purpose.
</p>
<p>Indeed, had Gowry designed to ship James aboard a
</p>
<p>vessel, in the mouth of the Forth, a much easier way would

</p>
<p>have been to have seized him in Falkland wood, as he hunt-
</p>
<p>ed with a few attendants. He would then have had fifteen
</p>
<p>miles less flight, consequently a proportionably less danger
</p>
<p>of rescue ; and the risque of being entrapped, together with
</p>
<p>his prisoner, within a walled town, would have been alto-
</p>
<p>gether avoided.
</p>
<p>These are arguments against the feasability of the Earl's
</p>
<p>taking this method of seizing the Royal Person. There are
</p>
<p>112
</p>
<p>others, and these very powerful ones, against the probability
</p>
<p>of Elizabeth taking any share in it.
</p>
<p>Want of discernment formed no part of the character of
</p>
<p>Elziabeth, or her ministers. The most profound policy al-
</p>
<p>ways directed their councils. But her detaining the Scot-
</p>
<p>tish King a prisoner, must have formed an exception to this
</p>
<p>rule. Scotland was by much the weaker kingdom of the two.
</p>
<p>James, although at large, was therefore unable to seize her
</p>
<p>kingdom by force. He was always extremely cautious of
</p>
<p>giving her offence, even suffering her to murder his mother,
</p>
<p>without doing more than expressing his resentment in words.
</p>
<p>As to his connecting himself with the continental powers ;
</p>
<p>his principal object in that, was of a piece with the rest of
</p>
<p>his conduct. He did it with the design of facilitating his
</p>
<p>succession to the throne of England, whenever it should be-
</p>
<p>come vacant. If, however, she had procured him to be
</p>
<p>seized, and had detained him prisoner, circumstances would
</p>
<p>have been much altered. By bribery she might have secur-
</p>
<p>ed the consent of a few of his subjects, but the far greater
</p>
<p>part would have become her enemies ; and perhaps might
</p>
<p>have taken some desperate course to rescue their king.
</p>
<p>James himself, spiritless as he confessedly was, would cer-
</p>
<p>tainly have considered this, both an injury and an indigni-
</p>
<p>ty. As he was neither her open enemy, nor her subject,
</p>
<p>he would have been justifiable in taking every step to procure
</p>
<p>his liberty, even although at the expense of her life. She
</p>
<p>lately had experienced, too, how impossible it is to prevent
</p>
<p>plots and conspiracies in favour of a dethroned Sovereign,
</p>
<p>as for a number of years, she had led a life of anxiety and
</p>
<p>inquietude, on account of the attempts in favour of James's
</p>
<p>mother, whilst in prison, notwithstanding all the vigilance
</p>
<p>of Mary's keepers, and the precaution ofEJjzabeth's minis-
</p>
<p>ters. But above all, what could have been the intention of
</p>
<p>the English ministers, in thus irritating James, at a time

<p>when he was shortly to become their master. They were
</p>
<p>men of first rate abilities, and of unbounded ambition.
</p>
<p>Elizabeth was now in her sixty eighth year. Bodily infir-
</p>
<p>mities, added to mental disquietude, were fast undermining
</p>
<p>her constitution. Supposing they had advised her to con-
</p>
<p>tine James, a year or two would set him at liberty, and then,
</p>
<p>they might well expect, that, like an enraged wikl beast,
</p>
<p>when unchained, Jie would tear those in pieces, who had
</p>
<p>kept him under restraint. But they were too cautious to run
</p>
<p>such risques. In fact, we now know, that long before this*
</p>
<p>they were endeavouring to gain his good will. Although
</p>
<p>they despised the man, they prudently wished to be on good
</p>
<p>terms with the king. Cecil, without whose knowledge Eli-
</p>
<p>zabeth engaged in no momentous enterprise, entered into
</p>
<p>a correspondence with James towards the end of her reign.
</p>
<p>Like a true courtier resolving that whoever should be sove-
</p>
<p>reign, he would be minister. Sir Walter Raleigh, indeed,
</p>
<p>when he saw the Queen drawing towards her end, proposed,
</p>
<p>that whoever should succeed to her throne* should be laid un-
</p>
<p>der some restraint, not unlike the Claim of Plights at the
</p>
<p>Revolution. But Cecil objected to this, well aware how
</p>
<p>disagreeable such a law would be to James ; and Raleigh
</p>
<p>reaped the fruits of his Patriotism, when James mounted
</p>
<p>the throne of England.
</p>
<p>No letters, nor written documents of any kind have ever
</p>
<p>been heard ot) hinting even in the most distant manner at
</p>
<p>any such conspiracy as this, although the Public Reposito-
</p>
<p>ries of England have been again and again explored by men
</p>
<p>of all opinions. And, although the great men about James's
</p>
<p>court were continually worrying one another with the view
</p>
<p>of gaining his favour, yet none of them were ever known
</p>
<p>to accuse another, of having a concern in any such matter.
</p>
<p>These considerations render it extremely improbable,
</p>
<p>that there was any such plot in existence, or contemplation,
</p>
<p>as the seizure of King James, and the conveying him to
</p>
<p>London.
</p>
<p>The next system which we are to discuss was published
</p>
<p>some few years ago by Mr Pinkerton in an appendix to the
</p>
<p>first volume of Laing's History of Scotland, 1st Edit.
</p>
<p>According to this, the Earl of Gowry was entirely inno-
</p>
<p>cent and ignorant of every kind of conspiracy against his
</p>
<p>sovereign. But James's Queen, Ann of Denmark, having
</p>
<p>an intrigue with Alexander Ruthven, and detesting her
</p>
<p>husband's person, the two lovers entered into a conspiracy

</p>
<p>against the king, and Alexander engaged either to murder
</p>
<p>or imprison him. But owing to the agitation of mind oc-
</p>
<p>casioned by having so momentous a concern on hand, he
</p>
<p>became insane at the critical period, mismanaged the busi-
</p>
<p>ness, and lost his life in the attempt. The Earl coming to
</p>
<p>P
</p>
<p>11*
</p>
<p>inquire into the nature of the bustle, was considered by
</p>
<p>James and his adherents, as an accomplice, or rather as
</p>
<p>principal in the treason, and punished accordingly.
</p>
<p>In support of this, we are told that James's person was
</p>
<p>ugly, his constitution feeble, his address aukward, his mind
</p>
<p>Weak and timid, and his attachment to worthless favourites
</p>
<p>disgraceful : in short every way a disagreeable mortal. On
</p>
<p>the other hand, that Ann was of a lusty amorous constitution,
</p>
<p>and a forward intriguing disposition, seldom inclined to render
</p>
<p>that submission, even in public affairs, which James consi-
</p>
<p>dered as due to a husband, and that husband the Lord's
</p>
<p>anointed. Thus circumstanced, it is natural to suppose,
</p>
<p>that not merely an indifference, but a disagreement would
</p>
<p>exist between them, and, in fact, that was the case. James,
</p>
<p>if we may credit some of his biographers, did not even con-
</p>
<p>fine his wandering inclinations to the sex ; but we arc assur-
</p>
<p>ed that Ann, more naturally, placed her affections on the
</p>
<p>handsomest men about court. Peyton, an English writer,
</p>
<p>says, that " besides Dowry's brother, she had a great num-
</p>
<p>ber of gallants, both in Scotland and England." One of
</p>
<p>the former, " the Bonny Earl of Moray" was assassinated
</p>
<p>on this account, at the instigation of James, some years be-
</p>
<p>fore this. Neville, who had lately returned from his em-
</p>
<p>bassy at Paris, writes to Winwood who succeeded him,
</p>
<p>" Many are of opinion, that the discovery of some affection
</p>
<p>between her" (i. e. Ann) " and the Earl of Gowry's brother,
</p>
<p>who was killed with him, was the truest cause and motive
</p>
<p>of all that tragedy." This letter is dated London, Nov*
</p>
<p>15, 1600.
</p>
<p>An anecdote transmitted from father to son, for these
</p>
<p>two hundred years bygone, bearing little internal probabi-
</p>
<p>lity, and originating from unknown authority, is quoted by
</p>
<p>some writers of great discernment, as evidence of this in-
</p>
<p>trigue.

<p>The King, it is said, notwithstanding his indifference to-
</p>
<p>wards the Queen, presented her with no less than a piece
</p>
<p>of Ribbon. Ann transferred the royal gift to her gallant,
</p>
<p>Alexander Ruthven, who wore it about his neck. Hap-
</p>
<p>pening to fall asleep, in the garden at Falkland, one warm
</p>
<p>day, James passing by, observed the ribbon under Alexan-
</p>
<p>der's neckloth. Stung with jealousy " he made quick haste
</p>
<p>to the palace," which indeed was at no great distance, as
</p>
<p>it serves for part of the garden wall. As good fortune
</p>
<p>113
</p>
<p>would have it, one of the Queen's ladies happened to be
</p>
<p>near, and saw the king look at Alexander. Witchcraft
</p>
<p>was then prevalent. She knew James's thoughts, and in-
</p>
<p>tentions ; and loosing the ribbon from under Alexander's
</p>
<p>cravat, with the celerity of a hag, and the delicacy of a
</p>
<p>maid of honour, she instantly presented herself, with the
</p>
<p>ribbon, before the Queen, whom chance, still favourable,
</p>
<p>had placed at her toilette, and desired Her Majesty to put
</p>
<p>the ribbon in a drawer. Scarcely had she disappeared, wh en
</p>
<p>James entered, and requested of the Queen, a sight of the
</p>
<p>redoubtable ribbon. Ann took it from the drawer, and gave
</p>
<p>it him; who, after satisfying himself of its identity with the
</p>
<p>one he had lately given her, returned it, and left the room
</p>
<p>muttering, " De'il tak me but like is an ill mark."
</p>
<p>Another circumstance is related, in confirmation of the
</p>
<p>-criminality of Ann and Alexander. On the death of the
</p>
<p>two brothers at Perth, the remaining brothers and sisters
</p>
<p>left the country, or lived in obscurit} r . A year or two af-
</p>
<p>terwards, the Queen ventured to admit one of them, Bea-
</p>
<p>trix, afterwards married to Sir John Home, into the pa-
</p>
<p>lace, without James's knowledge, where she had some conver-
</p>
<p>sation with Her Majesty, and as Beatrix and another of her
</p>
<p>sisters, had been two of the Ladies attendants, before the
</p>
<p>affair of the fifth of August, 'tis very probable, that she
</p>
<p>supplied them with some necessaries, which in the destitute
</p>
<p>and interdicted state of the family, all of them, certainly,
</p>
<p>were much in want of' Thus it sometimes happens, that
</p>
<p>even the best of our actions, are misrepresented, and when
</p>
<p>a turn is to be served, held up, as proceeding from the
</p>
<p>basest of motives. Even on the supposition, that the two el-
</p>
<p>der brothers were as guilty as the king represented them,
</p>
<p>the two younger brothers, and the sisters, never were charg-
</p>
<p>ed with having any way engaged in the attempt. There-
</p>
<p>fore however susceptible of love Ann may have been, cer-

</p>
<p>tainly excess of compassion would have formed no part of
</p>
<p>her character, had she not endeavoured to rescue from beg-
</p>
<p>gary, unfortunate but innocent servants.
</p>
<p>In taking notice of these testimonies, in favour of the
</p>
<p>reality of an amorous intrigue, between James's Queen, and
</p>
<p>Alexander Ruthven, it is not meant to deny, that any such
</p>
<p>existed. But we will say, that nothing we have heard ad-
</p>
<p>duced in its support, can impart the smallest conviction, to
</p>
<p>even the most credulous mind, that it did exist. The mvs~
</p>
<p>P2
</p>
<p>116
</p>
<p>terious light, in which the death of the Ruthvens at Perth^
</p>
<p>would be viewed in other places, where the Royal Account
</p>
<p>was the only information to be had, would naturally give
</p>
<p>rise to many conjectures, and no wonder, that among the
</p>
<p>rest, it should be affirmed, That, that catastrophe was oc-
</p>
<p>casioned by a criminal intercourse between one of them,
</p>
<p>and the Queen ; in consequence of which, either the King's
</p>
<p>jealousy induced him to cut off his guilty rival, or this lat-
</p>
<p>ter endeavoured to assassinate the King, that he might the
</p>
<p>more freely enjoy the Queen.
</p>
<p>As to the latter of these, namely, the supposition that
</p>
<p>Alexander was the assassin, we may observe in the first
</p>
<p>place, that if he meant to take away the King's life, he e-
</p>
<p>vidently did not mean to do it secretly, in carrying him to
</p>
<p>Perth on the fifth of August. According to James's own
</p>
<p>account of the matter, Alexander led him to Gowry's house,
</p>
<p>accompanied by at least, twenty armed men. Now what
</p>
<p>preposterous conduct was this ! A much better opportunity
</p>
<p>occurred in the morning, when James and he conversed
</p>
<p>together at the gate or breach in the park wall at Falkland.
</p>
<p>His Majesty's fellow sportsmen were then at some distance.
</p>
<p>Or, what would have afforded a still better opportunity
</p>
<p>whilst passing that extended, unfrequented defile, the Glen
</p>
<p>of Abernethy. It is true indeed, that if Alexander had
</p>
<p>killed the King at either of these places, he could have had
</p>
<p>Kttle prospect of escaping, either being secured alive, or in-
</p>
<p>stantly put to death by the attendants: but he had if possi-
</p>
<p>ble, still less, if he perpetrated the deed in Perth ; for be-
</p>
<p>sides being within a walled town, the gates of which might
</p>
<p>have been shut at a moment's notice, the King's attendants
</p>
<p>were either in the house, or about it ; several thousands of
</p>
<p>his subjects were within a minute's call ; and a number of
</p>
<p>the fleetest horses in Scotland stood ready saddled in the
</p>
<p>stables. But, setting aside every other consideration,

</p>
<p>Whither could such a regicide have fled? Where could
</p>
<p>he have found shelter? As those who advance this hypothe-
</p>
<p>sis allege, that Alexander's reason for conspiring against
</p>
<p>the King, was merely w r ith the view of getting possession of
</p>
<p>the Queen's person upon his death, that step would have
</p>
<p>been countenanced by no political party, foreign or domes-
</p>
<p>tic. None of these would either assist or protect such a cri-
</p>
<p>minal. In short, in case of his having thus murdered his
</p>
<p>sovereign, certain destruction -must have stared him in the
</p>
<p>117
</p>
<p>lace, unless master of such an army, as could overawe all
</p>
<p>the rest of Scotland, and very probably England. But not
</p>
<p>ja single man or weapon had he provided for the enterprize.
</p>
<p>Nor is the probability greater that the Queen went a-
</p>
<p>long with Alexander Ruthven in any such diabolical pur-
</p>
<p>pose. For admitting that she lived on very indifferent
</p>
<p>terms with her husband, and likewise that she was a wo-
</p>
<p>man of moral principles so abandoned, as to share in any
</p>
<p>transaction of this kind, still it would have been the depth
</p>
<p>of infatuation, for her to have wished the king's death ; far
</p>
<p>less to have been accessory to it. Whilst James w T as alive,
</p>
<p>there was a chance, that she might retain her external dig-
</p>
<p>nity and yet carry on a secret intrigue with a courtier. But
</p>
<p>if her paramour should openly murder her husband at her
</p>
<p>instigation, it was evident that she would not merely fall
</p>
<p>from her elevated station, but would forfeit her life. The
</p>
<p>whole nation, however disjointed otherwise, would join in
</p>
<p>punishing the regicides.
</p>
<p>Pinkerton finding it impossible to remove all the diffi-
</p>
<p>culties which occur in establishing this system, supposes,
</p>
<p>that the plot was well enough planned, but that Alexan-
</p>
<p>der's mind was incapable of supporting the whole of so
</p>
<p>weighty an affair, and that he became distracted, in at-
</p>
<p>tempting to execute it. Thus cutting the knot when una-
</p>
<p>ble to untie it. Yet it is the only way, in which his sup-
</p>
<p>posed management of some parts of the business, can be
</p>
<p>accounted for. Such as, his bringing the King to be mur-
</p>
<p>dered in another man's house, without so much as acquaint-
</p>
<p>ing the owner with his design, or asking his leave; his
</p>
<p>uncommon hurry at Falkland, and on the road, compared
</p>
<p>with the loss of time after their arrival ; his trusting the
</p>
<p>King to Henderson's keeping in the closet, whilst he (A-
</p>
<p>lexander) went out, pretending to go to Gowry, for the
</p>
<p>King's doom, even after Henderson bad manifested such

</p>
<p>symptoms of fear, as was visible by the King's account, and
</p>
<p>of loyalty, as appears by his own; and Alexander's proposing
</p>
<p>to the King, to suffer his hands to be tied, before his
</p>
<p>throat should be cut, as a butcher would do with the limbs
</p>
<p>of a calf. Every one of these, could only be the action of
</p>
<p>a madman.
</p>
<p>In confirmation of the probability of this system, Pin-
</p>
<p>kerton further tells us, that the palace of Gowry was of
</p>
<p>great extent, and some parts of it uninhabited, and even
</p>
<p>IIS
</p>
<p>rarely visited. If so, we have another instance of Alexan-
</p>
<p>der's insanity. For instead of enticing the King to one of
</p>
<p>these solitary dungeons (numbers of which were indeed in
</p>
<p>the ground floor of the house) and there finishing the tra-
</p>
<p>gedy, as quietly as possible, he conducts him up to the
</p>
<p>third floor, and into an apartment, the window of which
</p>
<p>overlooked the court and gate of this palace, always much
</p>
<p>frequented, but especially at this time, when the King and
</p>
<p>his servants were in the house. The South street of Perth,
</p>
<p>too, extended in a straight line, from within forty yards of
</p>
<p>the windows of this closet, to the other end of the town.
</p>
<p>The Parliament House, and many houses of the nobility
</p>
<p>and dignified clergy, were within call. Yet a front win-
</p>
<p>dow, in this populous neighbourhood, was the place cho-
</p>
<p>sen for either murdering or seizing the King.
</p>
<p>Pinkerton adds, that " the gardens of the palace extend-
</p>
<p>ed to the Tay, by which there was an easy access, to many
</p>
<p>remote castles in the Highlands,  and that perhaps James
</p>
<p>was to be conducted either by land or water, to some dis-
</p>
<p>tant concealment, and there perpetually imprisoned, or
</p>
<p>slain." A stranger, who reads this, will now perceive at
</p>
<p>once, how Alexander meant to dispose of James's person.
</p>
<p>After getting rid of the courtiers and servants, His Majes-
</p>
<p>ty, at nightfall, would have been put aboard a barge, and
</p>
<p>rowed up the river, and, by day break, landed perhaps at
</p>
<p>Killin or Dalwhinie ; for though the Earl had a castle at
</p>
<p>Trochrie, on the Bran, a branch of the Tay, yet it would
</p>
<p>have been obnoxious to suspicion. We say, a stranger to
</p>
<p>the country, would collect this much from Pinkerton. But
</p>
<p>when he is informed, that the Tay above Perth is not na-
</p>
<p>vigable for larger vessels than ferry boats and salmon co-
</p>
<p>bles, and that, there are only some parts of it, where these
</p>
<p>can even pass from one bank to the other ; but that no kind
</p>
<p>of vessel can sail along the stream, as it is a succession of

</p>
<p>rapids and cataracts, to the lakes whence its several branch-
</p>
<p>es issue, he must conclude, that the gentleman when he
</p>
<p>wrote the above passage, was either disingenuous or ill in-
</p>
<p>formed ; and, at any rate, that that part of his system is ill
</p>
<p>founded. The idea of carrying off James by land is possi-
</p>
<p>ble, but far from being probable. Gowry's house in Perth
</p>
<p>was by no means a fit place in which to seize the King,
</p>
<p>it was situated in a large town, the inhabitants of whicji
</p>
<p>might be expected to assist in a rescue; and though the
</p>
<p>is
</p>
<p>lis
</p>
<p>arden extended to the Tay, there was a considerable \iU
</p>
<p>age on the opposite bank, and the surrounding country
</p>
<p>was populous. The family seat, Ruthven Castle, a more
</p>
<p>extensive building, two miles distant, or Trochrie Gastle
</p>
<p>in the Highlands were places much better adapted for en-
</p>
<p>trapping him. The neighbours, all of whom lived at some
</p>
<p>distance, were Gowry's tenants, and neither he, nor his
</p>
<p>guests were in the way, or none of the family resided in ei-
</p>
<p>ther house at the time. These were places to which Alex-
</p>
<p>ander certainly would have decoyed the King, preferably to
</p>
<p>Perth ; and if he could not have been concealed in any of
</p>
<p>them, the recess to any " remote castle in the Highlands"
</p>
<p>was more open from any of them, than from Perth.
</p>
<p>Pinkerton accounts for the Earl's death by supposing,
</p>
<p>that seeing his brother slain, but ignorant of the nature of
</p>
<p>the rencontre in which he fell, he endeavoured to avenge
</p>
<p>his supposed murder, on those who killed him. This iri
</p>
<p>the heat of the moment, made them conclude, that he was
</p>
<p>an accomplice in the plot, and consign him to the same
</p>
<p>fate with Alexander.
</p>
<p>Some such shift as this, is certainly needed to complete
</p>
<p>this system, which supposes the guilt entirely confined to
</p>
<p>Alexander ; but, unluckily, it is flatly contradicted by the
</p>
<p>evidence of the crown witnesses themselves. They depone,
</p>
<p>that they massacred the Earl, whilst conversing with them,
</p>
<p>after they had put him off his guard, by astonishing him,
</p>
<p>with the information of the King's death.
</p>
<p>The other alternative of this system, namely, the sup-
</p>
<p>position that jealousy of Alexander induced James to mur-
</p>
<p>der him, is unsupported by every kind of evidence, unless
</p>
<p>some vague reports may be considered as such. But al-
</p>
<p>though it were established in the most satisfactory manner,
</p>
<p>still it does not account for the Earl's death and forfeiture,

</p>
<p>nor for the proscription of the rest of the family. And if
</p>
<p>that is not done, it must be granted, that James and his
</p>
<p>servants murdered the Earl, and ruined his family without
</p>
<p>any provocation.
</p>
<p>The third system originated with King James and his
</p>
<p>friends ; by it the Earl of Gowry, and his brother Alexan-
</p>
<p>der are supposed to have brought His Majesty to Perth,
</p>
<p>merely for the purpose of murdering him.
</p>
<p>120
</p>
<p>In support of this theory, we, to be sure, have the tes*
</p>
<p>timony of James and his courtiers; but that is the whole of
</p>
<p>the evidence. It is corroborated by no other circumstance.
</p>
<p>Indeed most, if not all of these relating to this affair, which
</p>
<p>have been handed down to us, lead to a very different con-
</p>
<p>clusion.
</p>
<p>The first inquiry that here presents itself is, What
</p>
<p>could be their motive for this ? We may rest assured, that
</p>
<p>had they been known before that day, to harbour any re-
</p>
<p>sentment towards James, it would have been brought for-
</p>
<p>ward in evidence against them. But nothing of this kind
</p>
<p>was ever attempted, even by their most inveterate enemies.
</p>
<p>Indeed by a passage of Calderwood's M. S. history, it ap-
</p>
<p>pears, that the Earl had opposed the imposition of some
</p>
<p>Tax which had been proposed in the convention* He is
</p>
<p>likewise known to have patronised the Presbyterian Party
</p>
<p>in the Church. But though in these particulars he might
</p>
<p>cross James's inclination that is no evidence that he would
</p>
<p>bereave him of his life. We perhaps will be told, that se-
</p>
<p>veral years before, Earl William, John's father, on a similar
</p>
<p>pretext, entered into a confederacy with some other noble-
</p>
<p>men, and seizing James's person, kept him prisoner for a
</p>
<p>Considerable time, and under the sanction of his name, ma-
</p>
<p>naged the affairs of the state according to their own liking.
</p>
<p>But that was a very different case. James was then a mi-
</p>

</p>
<p>two persons of very dissolute characters, and the restraint
</p>
<p>put upon him was the deed, not of Gowry, but of a consi-
</p>
<p>derable number of the principal nobility. But on the pre-
</p>
<p>sent occasion, James was in the prime of life. His court
</p>
<p>was composed of the chief noblemen of his kingdom. And
</p>
<p>on the other hand, it never could be discovered, that Earl
</p>
<p>John had a single accomplice of any description, unless his
</p>
<p>brother was one. Nothing; in short, seems to have been

</p>
<p>farther from their thoughts, than the offering any injury
</p>
<p>to his person. So far from that, that James and John seem
</p>
<p>to have been living on the most friendly terms ; for we are
</p>
<p>informed that the king wrote to the Earl, a few days be-
</p>
<p>fore his death, inviting him to spend some time at Falk-
</p>
<p>land, at the diversion of Buck-hunting, as appeared by the
</p>
<p>card found in his pocket, when he was slain.
</p>
<p>It has been said too, that Gowry had some pretensions
</p>
<p>to the crown, failing James. But this report can merit lit-
</p>
<p>m
</p>
<p>tie attention. James had several children; and many of
</p>
<p>the nobility could trace a nearer relation to the Royal Fa-
</p>
<p>mily than the House of Ruthven i The duke for instance
</p>
<p>was second cousin to the king.
</p>
<p>But supposing that the Earl and his brother had had
</p>
<p>sufficient inducement to endeavour to destroy King James;
</p>
<p>there still are obstacles to this system apparently insupera-
</p>
<p>ble. The time when, the place where, and the manner in
</p>
<p>which the attempt was said to have been made, were every
</p>
<p>one, the very worst that could have been fixed on for the
</p>
<p>purpose.
</p>
<p>The time was particularly ill chosen with regard to as-
</p>
<p>sistance ; for one of the Earl's servants was sick in bed, a-
</p>
<p>nother, as we shall afterwards hear, was twenty miles dis-
</p>
<p>tant, and the remaining number was so small, that he was
</p>
<p>under the necessity of causing his factor serve at table. On
</p>
<p>the other hand, there was, that day, a concourse of the
</p>
<p>Murrays of the Gospetrie and Tullibardine families, in
</p>
<p>Perth, at the marriage of one of the Clan. These were
</p>
<p>known to be staunch Loyalists, and it appeared from the
</p>
<p>event, that on this occasion^ they did not desert their prin-
</p>
<p>ciples.
</p>
<p>Nothing is more improbable, than to suppose^ that Gowry
</p>
<p>would pitch on that time, to make such an attempt.
</p>
<p>The place chosen was no less exceptionable. A front
</p>
<p>apartment, on the third floor, in the most frequented house
</p>
<p>in Perth, overlooking the court and gate-way, in full view,
</p>
<p>from one end to the other, of the then principal street, of
</p>
<p>the second town in the kingdom, and that town inclosed by
</p>
<p>a wall and wet ditch, was more like to be the scene chosen
</p>
<p>for publicly executing some first rate criminal, than for pri-
</p>
<p>vately making away with the Sovereign of the country. In-
</p>
<p>deed the very circumstance of the house being possessed by
</p>
<p>Gowry is, of itself, sufficient to satisfy every one, that he

</p>
<p>Was not the aggressor. A hundred persons saw the King
</p>
<p>enter the house. The last time he was seen, was passing
</p>
<p>from one part of it to another, in company with the Earl's
</p>
<p>brother. Had His Majesty been amissing; what account
</p>
<p>could the Earl have given? The puerile contrivance of send-
</p>
<p>ing away the King's attendants in a hurry to Falkland, in
</p>
<p>the belief that he was off before them, could only be a tem-
</p>
<p>porary shift. On their arrival there they must have missed
</p>
<p>him: &eir suspicions would then have been awakened: and
</p>
<p>Q
</p>
<p>122
</p>
<p>before midnight they would have returned to Perth with a
</p>
<p>force sufficient to overpower the conspirators. How was
</p>
<p>Gowry to extricate himself from this dilemma? It would
</p>
<p>have been much easier to have avoided it. If his brother
</p>
<p>with one servant was to accomplish the purpose, a thousand
</p>
<p>better opportunities could have been got. Even that same
</p>
<p>morning whilst conversing with James at Falkland, there
</p>
<p>was a possibility that he might have been dispatched unob-
</p>
<p>served. And if it was necessary to decoy him to one of
</p>
<p>Gowry's houses, there to assassinate him ; of all these, the
</p>
<p>one in Perth was most unsuitable. The Earl's castle of
</p>
<p>Trochrie in Strathbraan was a far more eligible place. The
</p>
<p>distance is only fifteen miles more than Perth, yet the situ-
</p>
<p>ation is considerably secluded, the environs being heaths,
</p>
<p>mountains, rivers, lakes, and copses. He might have been
</p>
<p>invited to spend some time there at grouse-shooting; by
</p>
<p>which means there would have been no occasion for the
</p>
<p>foolish story of the man and pot of gold.
</p>
<p>Nor was the agent fixed on to perpetrate the deed more'
</p>
<p>happily chosen. A far more feasible method of dispatching
</p>
<p>the King might have been devised, than by having a person
</p>
<p>involuntary to cut his throat. Gowry had a numerous vas-
</p>
<p>salage, extending through several counties; and there is
</p>
<p>not a doubt, but that the two brothers clearly saw, (sup-
</p>
<p>posing the King's system the real one) that their very lives
</p>
<p>and fortunes entirely depended upon the assassins promptly
</p>
<p>destroying their victim, the instant any one of them should
</p>
<p>give the order to do so. It is very strange then, that they
</p>
<p>should, in these circumstances, employ so chicken-hearted
</p>
<p>a fellow as Henderson was to murder the King. A fellow
</p>
<p>whose blood froze at the sight of the naked dagger, as ap-
</p>
<p>peared from his quaking and trembling : and whose fidelity
</p>
<p>could be so little depended on, that in place of sheathing
</p>
<p>the weapon in James's bosom, he wrenched it from Alexan-

<p>der's hand, when aiming a blow at the Royal Person ; and
</p>
<p>who declared, that he would die, rather than any harm
</p>
<p>should come to His Majesty.
</p>
<p>It is surprising that, though the Earl had such a number
</p>
<p>of friends and vassals, from amongst whom, he might have
</p>
<p>drawn as many as could have overpowered the Royal Party;
</p>
<p>though he was rich, and so had it in his power to hire des-
</p>
<p>peradoes for such a purpose; and though there were in the
</p>
<p>kingdom,, many persons disaffected to James, whom he
</p>
<p>123
</p>
<p>might have engaged in the attempt ; yet not a single indi-
</p>
<p>vidual (always excepting Henderson) was ever heard of, as
</p>
<p>being provided for the enterprise. Indeed, there were only
</p>
<p>three persons in the house, besides the menial servants, and
</p>
<p>these were neighbouring gentlemen, who happened to dine
</p>
<p>that day with the Earl : and the whole visitors and domes-
</p>
<p>tics did not equal in number those whom James brought
</p>
<p>with him from Falkland. In the manifesto, 'tis true, we
</p>
<p>are told that Gowry met the King, some short way out of
</p>
<p>town, attended by three or four score men. But as this is
</p>
<p>unsupported by any evidence, it must rest entirely on the
</p>
<p>Royal word. It is, however, by no means improbable,
</p>
<p>that in such a town, sixty or eighty might have the curiosity
</p>
<p>to go a quarter of a mile, for the purpose of seeing their
</p>
<p>King. We verily believe, that were His Majesty to visit
</p>
<p>Perm at this time, three or four thousand would accompany
</p>
<p>their chief magistrate, that length of way, to welcome their
</p>
<p>Sovereign. But if any of these were accomplices to the
</p>
<p>Earl in a plot against the King, why were they not brought
</p>
<p>forward in evidence against the Principal. The direct evi-
</p>
<p>dence of half-a-dozen of these, would have superseded the
</p>
<p>necessity of torturing poor Rynd, or of countenancing such
</p>
<p>inefficient perjuries as those of Henderson, Hay, and Mon-
</p>
<p>crieff*.
</p>
<p>But not only were the Earl's attendants few in number,
</p>
<p>but these few were by no means equipped for such an under-
</p>
<p>Q2
</p>
<p>* However, as the story was very lame in this particular, Parson Coupar
</p>
<p>endeavoured to make it more plausible, by posting from Stirling, across the
</p>
<p>country to Falkland, and relating an anecdote of Gowry. Coupar told, that
</p>
<p>having occasion, some days before, to wait on the Earl in his house, he found
</p>
<p>him reading a book entitled, " De Conjurationibus Adversus Principes ," and on
</p>
<p>being acquainted with the nature of the book, he remonstrated with the Earl
</p>
<p>for perusing any such writing as tending to mislead him.

</p>
<p>In every respect this has the air of a falsehood.
</p>
<p>Tn the first place, it is very improbable that Coupar, impertinent as we
</p>
<p>shall suppose him to have been, seeing he was so much inferior to Gowry ia
</p>
<p>every branch of erudition, would presume to dictate to him, what books he
</p>
<p>should or should not read, excepting perhaps irreligious ones.
</p>
<p>Secondly, If, as Coupar says, Gowry found fault with the contrivance of
</p>
<p>all the plots in that collection, because the conspirators imparted their designs
</p>
<p>to some other person, he certainly would have taken better care than to have
</p>
<p>communicated this much of his to Coupar.
</p>
<p>Thirdly, Coupar might with equal propriety have dissuaded Gowry from
</p>
<p>perusing the Bible on account of the immoralities recorded there ; or impeach-
</p>
<p>ed him for having read the very great number of treasonable and seditious
</p>
<p>histories which it contains.
</p>
<p>And lastly, We know of no Book bearing this Title, which then existed.
</p>
<p>124
</p>
<p>taking. At the beginning of the fray not one of them was
</p>
<p>armed, we shall also except Henderson. Several of the
</p>
<p>witnesses depone, That certain of Gowry's servants armed,
</p>
<p>accompanied him when he entered his house to learn the
</p>
<p>nature of the squabble ; but none are particularized except
</p>
<p>Thomas Cranston. The Earl, when he went in, is said to
</p>
<p>liave had a sword in each hand and a helmet on. It seems
</p>
<p>to have been fashionable for gentlemen to carry their swords
</p>
<p>with them, on every occasion, in that age ; as we find the
</p>
<p>courtiers, notwithstanding of all their hurry to accompany
</p>
<p>the King to Perth, waiting till their swords were procured.
</p>
<p>This will account for his having his sword at this time. But
</p>
<p>it was only when occasion required, that knapschaws or
</p>
<p>helmets were wore; consequently, he had to provide him-
</p>
<p>self with one after the fracas arose. And here we observe
</p>
<p>two parts of the story, to unite which in a satisfactory man-,
</p>
<p>ner, requires more ingenuity than we possess.
</p>
<p>Henderson depones, That after his return from Falk-
</p>
<p>land, he had gone home, and put on his coat of mail and
</p>
<p>helmet, by the direction of his master, Gowry, who pre-
</p>
<p>tended, that his assistance would be necessary in apprehend-
</p>
<p>ing a delinquent, of the name of Maconikiuy. Again the
</p>
<p>Earl, before he could with safety enter his own house, to
</p>
<p>learn the nature of the disturbance, found it necessary to
</p>
<p>arm himself; and as he could not come at his own helmet,
</p>
<p>he went to Henderson's house, and borrowed his. Now it
</p>
<p>is unaccountable how he could think of looking for it there;
</p>
<p>since, if we are to believe Henderson, he (Henderson) had,
</p>
<p>at Gowry's request, put on his armour only a short time be-
</p>
<p>fore, and when they went out to welcome the King, Gowry
</p>
<p>must have seen him actually armed cap-a-pie, and that,
</p>
<p>partly with this identical helmet ; and likewise must have
</p>
<p>known, that he had no opportunity of going home with it,
</p>
<p>having ever since that time, been busily employed, in one

</p>
<p>shape or other, in Gowry's house. Then how could he ex-
</p>
<p>pect to find it any where, but in his own house ? To this
</p>
<p>question it will perhaps be answered, that whatever induce-
</p>
<p>ment he had to seek for the helmet in Henderson's house,
</p>
<p>he was justified by the result, for he found it there, and
</p>
<p>brought it thence, Henderson having sent it home again,
</p>
<p>IJut what reason does Henderson give for this strange con-
</p>
<p>duct ? Wherefore, after having in the first place, obeye4
</p>
<p>his master's orders, in putting it on, docs he now act so di-
</p>
<p>125
</p>
<p>rectly contrary ? Why, he tells us, he just did, what many
</p>
<p>$ better man has done. He fell into a mistake, by suppos-
</p>
<p>ing, when he saw the Earl pass to the Inch to meet the
</p>
<p>King, that the caption of Maconilduy was delayed to ano-
</p>
<p>ther time, and of course that he would have no immediate
</p>
<p>occasion for his armour.
</p>
<p>Now, according to his own deposition, three hours had
</p>
<p>not yet elapsed, since he himself had told Go wry, that he
</p>
<p>might expect a visit from the King, in a few hours after-
</p>
<p>wards. At this instant Gowry ordered him, to join, and
</p>
<p>meet the King on his way to town. Henderson himself
</p>
<p>likewise now saw the royal cavalcade descending the hill, at
</p>
<p>less than a mile's distance. The exact time was now come,
</p>
<p>in which, according to his own information, it behooved the
</p>
<p>King to arrive: yet when the Earl rose from table, and
</p>
<p>went out, Henderson pretends, that it never struck him,
</p>
<p>that it was to welcome the King, but only to apprehend the
</p>
<p>culprit. He therefore sends for his steel bonnet and gaunt-
</p>
<p>let, that he might be equipped, for assisting in securing the
</p>
<p>offender. When, however, he saw his master pass, not to
</p>
<p>the South-Street where Maconilduy was to be found, but
</p>
<p>to the Inch, he sends home his helmet, without suggesting
</p>
<p>any thing like a plausible reason for his doing so. He
</p>
<p>knew of the King's coming, before he went for his armour,
</p>
<p>and of course, his actual arrival could furnish no pretext
</p>
<p>for sending it back: he pretends, that he supposed the Earl
</p>
<p>had given up the design of seizing Maconilduy on the King's
</p>
<p>arrival. But that is a glaring falsehood; as, even by his own
</p>
<p>account, it was only after he had told the Earl that he might
</p>
<p>look for a visit from the King in a few hours, that the Earl
</p>
<p>directed him to put on his armour, as he had a Highland-
</p>
<p>man to take. So that the King's presence could have no
</p>
<p>influence on his conduct towards Maconilduy, seeing, that
</p>
<p>Jie had declared his resolution, after being informed of His

</p>
<p>Majesty's intention, according to Henderson's own account.
</p>
<p>Henderson tells us farther, That he threw his gauntlet
</p>
<p>into the pantry. Indeed, considering how busy the servants
</p>
<p>must have been, on account of the unexpected arrival of the
</p>
<p>company from Falkland, it might well have been expected,
</p>
<p>that the helmet, as well as the gauntlet, would have been
</p>
<p>cast into the pantry? or some such bye place; and especially
</p>
<p>as there was a probability of its being wanted, so soon as the
</p>
<p>Earl was at leisure. Or as he (Henderson) was the prin*
</p>
<p>126
</p>
<p>cipal servant, perhaps he himself might have been entrust-
</p>
<p>ed with the taking of Maconilduy. On the whole, this
</p>
<p>part of the story is very poorly fabricated. But as it was
</p>
<p>necessary for the Earl's implication, that he should give
</p>
<p>Henderson his instructions, and among the rest desire him
</p>
<p>to arm ; and as on the other hand the Earl was seen by the
</p>
<p>populace, to bring the helmet from Henderson's house,
</p>
<p>perhaps this is the best that could be made of the matter.
</p>
<p>This part of the story is highly improbable, but not im-
</p>
<p>possible; which is more than can be said of the account
</p>
<p>given of procuring the helmet, when viewed in another
</p>
<p>light; as we shall have occasion to observe more particularly
</p>
<p>by and by.
</p>
<p>We see that one of the principal hinges of this system
</p>
<p>consists, in the Earl's sending his brother Alexander to
</p>
<p>Falkland, for the purpose of luring the king to Perth, on
</p>
<p>the fifth of August. That Alexander went to Falkland,
</p>
<p>and had an interview with the king, on that day, seems
</p>
<p>indisputable. But that he was sent on that errand by his
</p>
<p>brother is at least improbable, as it appears from the evi-
</p>
<p>dence, that the Earl did not expect a visit from the king at
</p>
<p>that time, otherwise he certainly would have been in wait-
</p>
<p>ing for him. In answer to this observation, it is insinuated,
</p>
<p>that either the Earl's antipathy to the king, or his pertur-
</p>
<p>bation of mind, occasioned by the impending event, pre-
</p>
<p>vented him from' entertaining His Majesty in a suitable
</p>
<p>manner. But if so, his conduct, in this respect, was the
</p>
<p>reverse of his brother's, in the morning, at Falkland, as
</p>
<p>" hee was never wont to make so lowe courtesie" as he did
</p>
<p>on that occasion, " bowing his head under His Majestie's
</p>
<p>knee," whereas the Earl had deliberately sat down to din-
</p>
<p>ner with a few friends, at the very time when, if we are to
</p>
<p>credit this relation, he was expecting His Majesty, and on-
</p>
<p>ly a short time before his arrival.

</p>
<p>But whatever side of the question we espouse, it does
</p>
<p>not at first sight appear, what reason Gowry could have
</p>
<p>for pretending ignorance of the king's coming, if he really
</p>
<p>knew of it. If the Earl had no evil designs on the king,
</p>
<p>one might think that he certainly would have entertained
</p>
<p>him in a suitable manner. And on the other hand, if he
</p>
<p>meant to decoy His Majesty to his house, with the design
</p>
<p>of either killing, or confining him ; instead of employing
</p>
<p>his brother Alexander to bring him there by a trick, and
</p>
<p>127
</p>
<p>when he was brought, neglecting to welcome him, he would
</p>
<p>surely have baited the trap, by preparing a feast and invi J
</p>
<p>ting him to partake of it.
</p>
<p>On second thoughts, however, we will discover, that
</p>
<p>this was the readiest, perhaps the only method of bringing
</p>
<p>home guilt to Go wry. The case seems to have been this,
</p>
<p>That he, in appearance, had no expectation of a visit from
</p>
<p>the king at that time, was a circumstance which could not
</p>
<p>be concealed from the world, there being so many witnes-
</p>
<p>ses, that no preparation was made for his reception*. It
</p>
<p>therefore became necessary to give out, that Gowry did
</p>
<p>know of James's coming, or how could blame attach to him ?
</p>
<p>The only alternative that then remained, was to say, that
</p>
<p>he knew of it, but concealed that knowledge. Thus far all
</p>
<p>is well. But still the difficulty is not removed. The ques-
</p>
<p>tion, What reason could he have for this false pretence ?
</p>
<p>still obtrudes itself. And it seems James with all his wis-
</p>
<p>dom, could not devise a satisfactory answer.
</p>
<p>We are likewise told, that Alexander left the company
</p>
<p>about a mile from Perth, and rode on before, to advise the
</p>
<p>Earl of the king's approach. Now this step was altogether
</p>
<p>unnecessary, if there was the least expectation of the visit ;
</p>
<p>because the Royal Party could have been distinctly seen,
</p>
<p>from Gowry's house, descending the hill, for more than a
</p>
<p>mile from the town, and in that case, certainly would have
</p>
<p>been looked for.
</p>
<p>Henderson, indeed, declares, that Alexander sent him
</p>
<p>in the morning, from Falkland to the Earl, with advice of
</p>
<p>the King's intention of following to dinner. But we know,
</p>
<p>that Henderson was a liar; and it was pretty evident that
</p>
<p>he was not at Falkland on that occasion. No one saw
</p>
<p>him, either going or returning, nor in Falkland ; even the
</p>
<p>landlord of the Inn which he used to frequent did not see
</p>
<p>him, none of the courtiers saw him, nor any of the king's

<p>grooms or menials. Prior Hay and his brother, indeed,
</p>
<p>are made to . tell that being in company with Gowry that
</p>
<p>forenoon, they saw Henderson come in booted from Falk-
</p>
<p>land, and heard the Earl ask him some questions, relative
</p>
<p>to what he observed there. Mr MoncrieiF, too, depones,

<p>that Henderson informed him he had that day been a short

</p>
<p>strained to be sure, but every way of a piece with the other
</p>
<p>proceedings, it was known that he had Been a stage to the
</p>
<p>south of it* Rynd likewise says, that Andrew Ruthven in
</p>
<p>effect told him of Henderson's being with his Master and
</p>
<p>himself at Falkland. But it is evident, that this was forced
</p>
<p>from him by the boots. For a long time, he denied, that
</p>
<p>he knew of * any such thing. Indeed, whoever peruses his
</p>
<p>declaration, must be satisfied that that really was the case ;
</p>
<p>and, that, when he is at length brought to say, that An-
</p>
<p>drew Ruthven told him, that Henderson was sent forward
</p>
<p>to advise the Earl of the King's coming, such declaration
</p>
<p>was merely forced from him by the hangman's mallet ; as
</p>
<p>likewise was the case with that part of his declaration, where
</p>
<p>he says that he believes the Earl told a falsehood, in saying,
</p>
<p>"That he did not understand what brought the king to
</p>
<p>Perth." Which assertion Rynd had mentioned openly
</p>
<p>some days before his examination.
</p>
<p>Henderson in his deposition at the trial, November
</p>
<p>1 5th, says, on his arrival from Falkland, he saw the Hays
</p>
<p>speak with the Earl of Gowry ; but at the precognition at
</p>
<p>Falkland, August 20th, he mentioned no such circumstance,
</p>
<p>he only says that on his arrival from Falkland, the Earl
</p>
<p>left the company he was speaking with. This is easily ac-
</p>
<p>counted for. At that time (August 20th) the plan of the
</p>
<p>plot was not well enough digested, nor were  the necessary
</p>
<p>instruments provided; but in the course of three months, it
</p>
<p>was more matured; better arrangements were made, and
</p>
<p>witnesses prepared to establish the several parts of the sto-
</p>
<p>ry. But the support which it receives from their evidence,
</p>
<p>is but small. They say that they had some business to
</p>
<p>transact with Gowry that day, and that they came to Perth,
</p>
<p>and waited on him in his house for that purpose, but that

</p>
<p>his message, the Earl told them, that they must come some
</p>
<p>other day, as he was so much engaged at that time. Here
</p>
<p>we are to observe, that we are not let into the knowledge
</p>
<p>of the nature of their business with Gowry. It was prudent
</p>
<p>not to attempt to do that, since there is a probability that
</p>
<p>they had none. They (George especially) would have been
</p>
<p>very ungrateful had they not proifered some assistance to
</p>
<p>James in an emergency of this kind. George had for some
</p>
<p>vears been a Gentleman of the Bedchamber, and he had
</p>
<p>129
</p>
<p>lately obtained a grant of the Carthusian monastery in
</p>
<p>Perth. It was besides well known, that James commonly
</p>
<p>followed the prior's advice in ecclesiastical matters, particu-
</p>
<p>larly in the attempt which he made for reconciliation with
</p>
<p>Rome : and, supposing the attention due to his Master and
</p>
<p>Sovereign overlooked, it is difficult to conceive, how he
</p>
<p>could have exculpated himself to his uncle and patron Fa-
</p>
<p>ther Edmund, had he neglected to take part, in such a
</p>
<p>master-stroke, as the assassination of the leader of the Pres-
</p>
<p>byterian interest in Scotland.
</p>
<p>The eagerness with which the reality of Henderson's
</p>
<p>journey to Falkland was attempted to be proven, is a cir-
</p>
<p>cumstance 5 which of itself weakens our belief of it. It
</p>
<p>shows, that his being there at that time, was doubted of by
</p>
<p>some. And, it must be owned, that they were not very in-
</p>
<p>credulous, who were convinced by any thing that is brought
</p>
<p>forward in the proof. Had he been there, there was no
</p>
<p>reason for concealing it. Mr llynd says, that Andrew
</p>
<p>Ruthven told him, that he (Andrew Ruthven) was along
</p>
<p>with Mr Alexander at Falkland ; and this he did in Gow-
</p>
<p>ry's presence. So that their being there was made no se-
</p>
<p>cret o For although it is not at all uncommon for servants
</p>
<p>to divulge their masters' secrets, they usually take care, not
</p>
<p>to do it in their hearing. But if Henderson was there, and
</p>
<p>the court found it of so much importance to establish that
</p>
<p>fact, why have recourse to this suspicious, round about,
</p>
<p>hearsay evidence? Why not bring forward a number of
</p>
<p>credible, because disinterested witnesses, such as Lamb,
</p>
<p>Balfour, or Nasmith, the Innkeepers, and Surgeon, and es-
</p>
<p>tablish the point at once ?
</p>
<p>There is still another question, which here unluckily
</p>
<p>presents itself, and that is, What could be Gowry's design,
</p>
<p>in sending his chamberlain to Falkland ? If he had any
</p>
<p>business, however trivial, to transact with the King, and

</p>
<p>neither himself nor his brother at leisure, there would have
</p>
<p>been no impropriety in sending his factor to negotiate with
</p>
<p>so great a personage. But here, Henderson is sent to
</p>
<p>Falkland, merely, (taking their own account) to return
</p>
<p>with notice, that the king was to follow in a couple of
</p>
<p>hours. A message which might have been carried, either
</p>
<p>in writing, or verbally, by any body, even the most insig-
</p>
<p>nificant stable boy. All that could be meant by it, being
</p>
<p>merely to give Gowry a little previous notice, so as he
</p>
<p>R
</p>
<p>130
</p>
<p>might be in readiness for receiving his royal guest, of what-
</p>
<p>ever kind tliat reception should be.
</p>
<p>Calderwood informs us, that the Earl meant to have
</p>
<p>gone to Lothian, on the 5th of August, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>asking his mother, who lived at Dirlton, to come and live
</p>
<p>with him; and it is added, that he was expected about
</p>
<p>the same time, to have waited on the Lady, who afterwards
</p>
<p>was Countess of Angus, at Seaton, for whom he was known
</p>
<p>to have had a partiality, but delayed the journey, till he
</p>
<p>should learn what his brother was sent for to Falkland.
</p>
<p>Thus, in every point of view, it is evident, that this part
</p>
<p>of the narrative is improbable. But it is absolutely neces-
</p>
<p>sary. Take away Gowry's guilt of instructing Henderson
</p>
<p>to attend Alexander to Falkland, for the purpose of re-
</p>
<p>turning with early intelligence; and of directing him to
</p>
<p>arm, when they knew of the king's coming, and there is
</p>
<p>not a single circumstance which criminates him in the whole
</p>
<p>story ; for his endeavouring to quell a riot in his own house,
</p>
<p>of which he knew not the nature, was highly praiseworthy.
</p>
<p>This being the case, the king's party were under the indis-
</p>
<p>pensable necessity of having recourse to this method of con^
</p>
<p>victing him of treason. Had they not accomplished that,
</p>
<p>though the rapacious ruffians had already got their malice
</p>
<p>in part gratified, by the death of the two brothers, their a-
</p>
<p>varice and necessities must have remained wholly unsatisfi-
</p>
<p>ed, as the estate would have fallen to the heir at law.
</p>
<p>If it is strange that Gowry should send his chamberlain
</p>
<p>on such an errand, it is no less surprising, that when he
</p>
<p>received the information, he should make no manner of
</p>
<p>use of it. For when Alexander came in himself, only a
</p>
<p>short time before the king and his train, in place of finding
</p>
<p>the Cooks and other servants in a bustle, preparing dinner
</p>
<p>for the visitors ; and the Earl disposing of his armed assas-
</p>
<p>sins, in their several lurking places, where they might be

</p>
<p>in readiness to rush out, and strike the blow ; he found e-
</p>
<p>very thing in ordinary stile ; and the Earl quietly eating his
</p>
<p>dinner with three neighbouring gentlemen. And although
</p>
<p>he should have known, that the King and his attendants
</p>
<p>had been on horseback, since seven o'clock in the morning,
</p>
<p>yet not a morsel was prepared for them.
</p>
<p>The inducement said to have been held out by Alexan-
</p>
<p>der, for drawing the king from Falkland to Perth, is child-
</p>
<p>ish and improbable in the extreme; 1st. Alexander gives
</p>
<p>131
</p>
<p>no reason why he intermeddled with a stranger, whom he
</p>
<p>accidentally met, carrying something under his cloak ; nor
</p>
<p>2dly. Why he did not bring the gold to Falkland, or de-
</p>
<p>posit it where it would be safe till his return to Perth, and
</p>
<p>then there would have been no danger that the King, by
</p>
<p>his delay, " would make the treasure be meddled with be-
</p>
<p>fore any word could come from His Majesty." And in o-
</p>
<p>ther points, where any kind of reasons are given, they are
</p>
<p>very little to the purpose. Thus Alexander when urging
</p>
<p>James to leave his diversion and hasten to Perth, tells him,
</p>
<p>that his "long delay, would breed leisure to the fellow, who
</p>
<p>was lying bound to cry or make -dinne," just as if he
</p>
<p>could not in the night, or whilst Alexander was riding
</p>
<p>thirty miles in the morning, cry as well as at any time af-
</p>
<p>terwards. Again, Alexander seems to speak doubtfully of
</p>
<p>the coin in which he found the gold. He had examined
</p>
<p>the quantity, for he informed James that the pot " was all
</p>
<p>full of coined gold of great pieces." Yet, in answer to a
</p>
<p>question from His Majesty, he says, that " as farre as he
</p>
<p>could take leisure to see them, that they seemed to be for-
</p>
<p>reine strokes of Coyne." Now he had all night to inspect
</p>
<p>them. Such improbable inconsistencies could not escape
</p>
<p>the observation of any man of common sense. Nor can it
</p>
<p>be urged in James's cause, that he is not accountable for
</p>
<p>Alexander Ruthven's reveries ; for he pretended to be con-
</p>
<p>vinced of the reality of the story ; but which is supported
</p>
<p>by no kind of evidence whatever, excepting his bare asser-
</p>
<p>tion : and if we consider the known depravity of his cha-
</p>
<p>racter, and the dilemma in which he must have found him-
</p>
<p>self, on perceiving that the world believed he had delibe-
</p>
<p>rately murdered the two brothers, we must allow that the
</p>
<p>probability that he invented and propagated this, is much
</p>
<p>greater, than that Alexander would attempt to palm any
</p>
<p>such nonsense upon him, as that he, (Alexander) though

<p>but a private person, would seize a man whom he by chance
</p>
<p>met with, carry him into the town of Perth, bind, and in
</p>
<p>another man's house, and that man the chief magistrate of
</p>
<p>the place, imprison him, without any assistance, or legal
</p>
<p>authority, or so much as being observed by any one ; and
</p>
<p>all for no other reason, than that of his having a sum of
</p>
<p>money in his custody, and which could be no reason as it
</p>
<p>Mas not known, till he was " meddled with."
</p>
<p>We are told that Alexander gave the king the infprma-
</p>
<p>R2
</p>
<p>132
</p>
<p>don in the morning, before he began hunting ; and that
</p>
<p>James then agreed to go, only he would first follow the chace
</p>
<p>for some time ; and that Alexander never left him, whilst
</p>
<p>thus engaged, but constantly urged him to leave off, and
</p>
<p>go to Perth instantly. And that, when James was at length
</p>
<p>to set out, Alexander would not, for fear of losing time, al-
</p>
<p>low him to wait for a fresh horse ; and on the road, was
</p>
<p>continually entreating him to spur on, for fear that the man
</p>
<p>and gold should be some how discovered. But that on their
</p>
<p>arrival at Perth, though James waited an hour before din-
</p>
<p>ner was ready, during which he seems to have been entire-
</p>
<p>ly unengaged, he sees not the object of his journey ; so com-
</p>
<p>pletely is the former hurry changed to dilatoriness equally
</p>
<p>unaccountable. As might well have been expected, this
</p>
<p>inconsistency is laid at the door of one of the Ruthvens.
</p>
<p>We are assured in the discourse, that James wished to ex-
</p>
<p>amine the stranger whilst dinner was preparing, but was
</p>
<p>dissuaded by Alexander telling him, that there was no haste
</p>
<p>till he should dine at leisure, as all was sure enough for an
</p>
<p>hour. And that when at length Alexander wished to carry
</p>
<p>him up stairs, he prevailed on His Majesty to send the Earl
</p>
<p>(in order to be " quit of him,") into the hall where the
</p>
<p>courtiers were at dinner. By all this it is insinuated that
</p>
<p>the conspirators, Gowry and his brother Alexander, de-
</p>
<p>signed to delay making the attempt, till the king's atten-
</p>
<p>dants were engaged at dinner. A silly contrivance truly,
</p>
<p>as, so soon as that was over, they certainly would enquire
</p>
<p>after their master. But weak as it is, every part of it is done
</p>
<p>away by reflecting, in the first place, that they did not ride
</p>
<p>to Perth at any uncommon pace. Some of them stopped
</p>
<p>and fed their horses ; James stopped and had a conversation
</p>
<p>with Lennox; and first Andrew Ruthven, and then Alex-
</p>
<p>ander Ruthven, though mounted on horses that had come
</p>
<p>from Perth that morning, and had been in the chase along

</p>
<p>with the others, were able to leave them on the way, and
</p>
<p>even distance them so far, that Alexander, though he left
</p>
<p>them only at the last mile, had time to give the Earl advice,
</p>
<p>and he again, after mustering his friends and servants, was
</p>
<p>able to go out a quarter of a mile before they met the king.
</p>
<p>So that they must have rode at a very slow rate. Secondly,
</p>
<p>If it was considered as of such importance for James's atten-
</p>
<p>dants to be diverted from observing him pass up stairs, that
</p>
<p>Gowry himself took that offtce upon him, it is highly im-
</p>
<p>'133
</p>
<p>probable that they should have gone through the apartment
</p>
<p>where these attendants were sitting, and the Earl with them,
</p>
<p>as another course could easily have been taken.
</p>
<p>The plain fact seems to be this : when the king had din-
</p>
<p>ed, the Earl left his presence, and came into the hall to " en-
</p>
<p>tertayn" the noblemen and gentlemen, who had escorted
</p>
<p>him from Falkland, while at dinner. In a short time there-
</p>
<p>after, the king's party thought it proper to proceed to the
</p>
<p>business of the day*, when James and Alexander passed
</p>
<p>through the hall, and up stairs, by themselves. James
</p>
<p>foresaw that this last circumstance might be considered as
</p>
<p>having taken place without the Earl's knowledge, and
</p>
<p>would then be construed into an exculpation of him. And
</p>
<p>as it was done before the whole guests, and servants, and on-
</p>
<p>lookers, it was impossible to conceal it from the world.
</p>
<p>Therefore he gave out, that the two brothers had concerted
</p>
<p>their plot in this way : That the Earl should divert the at-
</p>
<p>tention of the noblemen, while Alexander took His Majes-
</p>
<p>ty away, and cut his throat.
</p>
<p>By the manifesto we are informed that after the King
</p>
<p>came to Perth, and whilst he waited for dinner, he attempt-
</p>
<p>ed to enter into conversation with Gowry, " but could get
</p>
<p>no direct answer of him, but half words, and imperfect sen-
</p>
<p>tences." And during dinner " he stood very pensive, and
</p>
<p>with a dejected countenance without any welcoming
</p>
<p>of His Majesty, or any other hearty form of entertainment."
</p>
<p>And after he had " conveyed" the King's attendants " forth
</p>
<p>to their dinner," he " sat not down with them himself, (as
</p>
<p>the common manner is) but came back, and stood silent at
</p>
<p>the end of the King's table." We can be at no loss to dis-
</p>
<p>cover the reason why these particulars are mentioned here.
</p>
<p>It clearly is with the design of affording collateral evidence
</p>
<p>of Gowry's treason. Indeed if he was now embarked in an
</p>
<p>enterprise, perilous and momentous, as an attempt upon the

</p>
<p>King's life would have been, this abstraction of mind would
</p>
<p>naturally take place. And however well the principle out-
</p>
<p>lines of the plot might have been sketched before hand, in
</p>
<p>the moment of execution, a number of minute circumstances
</p>
<p>would occur, which, not having been foreseen, could not
</p>
<p>be provided against. Hence, we are to suppose that the
</p>
<p>arch-traitor, in frequently going out and in, was employed
</p>
<p>* There is a tradition in Perth that James desired Alexander to lead him
</p>
<p>fo the necessary-house.
</p>
<p>134
</p>
<p>in giving instructions to some of his abettors, and in fre-
</p>
<p>quent visits to the places where others were posted.
</p>
<p>But on the other hand, might not this thoughtful deject-
</p>
<p>ed state of mind under which the Earl laboured on this oc-
</p>
<p>casion, be accounted for on the other hypothesis. He saw
</p>
<p>the king, who, he had reason for supposing, was secret-
</p>
<p>ly no friend of his, attended by a number of servants and
</p>
<p>favourites, all armed, some at least of whom were his (the
</p>
<p>Earl's) avowed enemies, unexpectedly enter his house, with-
</p>
<p>out, so far as he knew, having any business there. It
</p>
<p>would likewise occur to him, that another band of his ene-
</p>
<p>mies were collected in the town, on another pretence. He
</p>
<p>could not comprehend the design of all this, far less foresee
</p>
<p>the consequences. No wonder then, that his mind was agi-
</p>
<p>tated. As to his not sitting down to dine with the king's fol-
</p>
<p>lowers, that may be accounted for to the satisfaction of some
</p>
<p>people, b} r merely reflecting that little more than an hour
</p>
<p>had elapsed since he dined; and though he could not eat
</p>
<p>with them, we find that he waited on them while they dined.
</p>
<p>The next circumstance taken notice of is, if possible,
</p>
<p>still more incredible. James was naturally very timorous.
</p>
<p>On the way from Falkland, his apprehensions of danger
</p>
<p>rose so high, that calling Lennox aside, and imparting the
</p>
<p>seo et to him, he desired his advice ; his grace agreed with
</p>
<p>His Majesty, that the story was " very suspicious and un-
</p>
<p>likely," and the result of their joint deliberation was, that the
</p>
<p>greatest caution was to be observed, on their arrival at
</p>
<p>Perth. The king says lie " always'-' desired the Duke " not
</p>
<p>to fail to accompany him into the house where the alleged
</p>
<p>fellow and treasure was." The Duke depones, that the
</p>
<p>king said to him, both on the road, and in Gowry's house,
</p>
<p>" take tent where I pass with Mr Alexander Ruthven and
</p>
<p>follow me." This is all very well : but mark the issue. After
</p>
<p>dinner James, notwithstanding his grievous apprehensions,

</p>
<p>goes unarmed, along with Alexander, who had a sword,
</p>
<p>and who, as they passed along through several apartments,
</p>
<p>" locked behind him every doore." The Duke too, not-
</p>
<p>withstanding his own suspicions, and his sovereign's injunc-
</p>
<p>tions, sees the king dressed in his green jacket, and having
</p>
<p>only his hunting-horn about him, retire with Alexander
</p>
<p>armed, and whom he shrewdly suspected to be either a mad-
</p>
<p>man or a traitor. Yet he continues at his glass, seemingly
</p>
<p>quite unconcerned. Nay more, when at last he rises from ta-*
</p>
<p>135
</p>
<p>ble, he does not follow his master up stairs, there torescuehim
</p>
<p>from the danger with which he, at that instant, supposed
</p>
<p>him beset, but steps out, and into the garden, with some
</p>
<p>others of the company there, we presume, to solace them-
</p>
<p>selves with the fresh breeze on the bank of the river.
</p>
<p>From a cursory perusal of the Royal narrative, indeed,
</p>
<p>one might be led to conclude, that James, at the instigation
</p>
<p>of Alexander, as they passed the company in the hall, pub-
</p>
<p>licly commanded that none should follow them, whilst at
</p>
<p>the same time Alexander undertook privately to desire
</p>
<p>Thomas Erskin to attend them, which, however, he (Alex-
</p>
<p>ander) did not perform. This is wholly unsupported by
</p>
<p>every kind of evidence. Erskin says, that on his afterwards
</p>
<p>expostulating with the king for not " concrediting more to"
</p>
<p>him, His Majesty answered, " The traitor deceived me
</p>
<p>I commanded him to bring you to me, which he pro-
</p>
<p>mised to me to do, and returned back as I thought to fetch
</p>
<p>you, but he did nothing but steiked the door." This, surely,
</p>
<p>outrages all common sense. James dreaded that Alexander's
</p>
<p>leading him to a distant part of the house, was with no
</p>
<p>friendly design, possibly to take his life. To prevent any
</p>
<p>thing of that kind, he sends him for assistance from among
</p>
<p>the gentlemen of the court. And though Alexander return-
</p>
<p>ed without any, which must have turned James's suspicions
</p>
<p>to almost certainty, His Majesty still goes along, though, as he
</p>
<p>saw door after door locked behind him, his dread of dan-
</p>
<p>ger must have been heightened at every step. James must
</p>
<p>have had a very mean opinion, indeed, of the intellects of his
</p>
<p>contemporaries, when he supposed them incapable of de-
</p>
<p>tecting such absurdities.
</p>
<p>Thus Alexander leads the king into the  Round," or
</p>
<p>small projecting turret, the scene where the tragedy, we are
</p>
<p>to suppose, was to be acted. There can be no doubt, but
</p>
<p>that to secure success in a matter of so much importance,

<p>Gowry would have adopted the most decisive measures, and
</p>
<p>among others, he would have had three or four resolute ac-
</p>
<p>complices in readiness, within this apartment, for it was in-
</p>
<p>capable of containing a larger number, and to bar accidents,
</p>
<p>some thousands of his vassals stationed in other parts of the
</p>
<p>house and offices. But no proof is even attempted, that any
</p>
<p>kind of preparation was made. Instead of a numerous as-
</p>
<p>semblage of Gowry's retainers, we hear of only a single in-
</p>
<p>dividual. Instead of his appearance bespeaking him to be
</p>
<p>136
</p>
<p>ah unconscientious, tried, and determined cut-throat, whd
</p>
<p>had been informed of the plot, and had agreed to become
</p>
<p>the principal instrument in accomplishing it, he turns out
</p>
<p>to be a poor astonished poltroon, " who did nothing but
</p>
<p>tremble all the time," thrust per force " like a dog" into this
</p>
<p>apartment, without receiving the least intimation of what
</p>
<p>was expected of him ; so much attached to the king, that
</p>
<p>lie protested, that before any evil should be done to His Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty, he " should first die ;" and does wrench the dagger
</p>
<p>from Alexander's hand. So truly pious withal, that for
</p>
<p>half an hour he was on his knees praying God to avert
</p>
<p>" some evil" that he " feared to be done." This is all very
</p>
<p>strange; but by and by w T e shall even find this " trembling
</p>
<p>astonished fellow" evanish into a non-entity.
</p>
<p>We are told, that this " said fellow" had a dagger at his
</p>
<p>girdle, which Alexander Ruthven, so soon as he had en-
</p>
<p>tered with the King in his arm, and locked the door of the
</p>
<p>study behind him, drew; and holding the point to His Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty's breast, used some threatening expressions. But what
</p>
<p>the import of these were, is a question not easily solved. In
</p>
<p>the precognition taken at Falkland, Henderson deponed,
</p>
<p>That the words made use of by Alexander were, " Remem-
</p>
<p>ber ye of my father's murder ? Yee shall now die for it." At
</p>
<p>the same instant aiming a blow at His Majesty's heart, which
</p>
<p>had inevitably been fatal, if Henderson had not parried it.
</p>
<p>But at the trial the wretch flatly contradicts himself. He then
</p>
<p>swore, That Alexander " says to the King, having the drawn
</p>
<p>whinger in his hand, Sir, you must be my prisoner; re-
</p>
<p>member on my father's death." And when " the King was
</p>
<p>beginning to speak, the Master said, Hold your tongue,
</p>
<p>Sir, or, by Christ, yee shall die." The precise meaning
</p>
<p>of the words made use of on this occasion, must be of the
</p>
<p>very utmost importance, to those who believe that some
</p>
<p>such words were spoken ; yet we are completely left in the

</p>
<p>dark, respecting them, by this witness ; and he is the only
</p>
<p>one who pretended to be present. We must, therefore, at-
</p>
<p>tend to what the King says, though a party. But we are-
</p>
<p>left just as much in the dark by him, as by Henderson.
</p>
<p>His account neither informs us, whether His Majesty was
</p>
<p>to be instantly butchered or imprisoned, but says, that " A-
</p>
<p>lexander held the point of it," i. e. the dagger " to
</p>
<p>the King's breast, avowing now that the King behooved to
</p>
<p>be in his will, and used as he list." In short, all and every
</p>
<p>is?
</p>
<p>one of these accounts, bear evident marks of falsehood: fotf
</p>
<p>nobody would ever think of secretly confiningpor murdering
</p>
<p>any person, in such a place as this turret, whose dimen-
</p>
<p>sions are so small, as to prevent its being divided into dif-
</p>
<p>ferent apartments ; and from the windows of which, hun-
</p>
<p>dreds of people were within view, and within hearing, at
</p>
<p>all times of the day. The place best adapted for either pur-
</p>
<p>pose, was some one of these recesses which, a late writer
</p>
<p>says, extended from the house, backwards to the Tay. Nor
</p>
<p>is it probable, that Alexander, as he had none but poor
</p>
<p>trembling Henderson to assist him, would, if he meant td
</p>
<p>kill the King, tell him so, in such a deliberate manner; just
</p>
<p>as if he designed to put him on his guard. Had it been
</p>
<p>impossible for His Majesty to resist, Alexander might then
</p>
<p>have safely gratified his resentment, by expatiating on His
</p>
<p>Majesty's cruelty and injustice ; but circumstanced as they
</p>
<p>then were^ we may well presume, that Alexander, if he
</p>
<p>meant to take the king's life, instead of hazarding all by a
</p>
<p>tedious altercation, would have stabbed him instantly. The
</p>
<p>liar Henderson, indeed, says, "that Alexander intended to
</p>
<p>have done so, had it not been, that he " threw the" dagger
</p>
<p><( out of the Master's hand." But James's account says no-
</p>
<p>thing of this : and we learn irom a letter of Nicolson's to
</p>
<p>Cecil, that the king remembered nothing of it. And, con-
</p>
<p>sidering the fright he was in, it certainly is highly improba-
</p>
<p>ble, that he would act any such part at that time. It can-
</p>
<p>not, however, be our business to determine, which of these
</p>
<p>accounts is the true one, since we are satisfied that they are
</p>
<p>both false.
</p>
<p>The account which James gives of this matter, is, That
</p>
<p>it was his own soothing and persuasive language, which dis-
</p>
<p>armed Alexander Ruthven, even, it appears, after he had
</p>
<p>his arm extended to give the fatal blow. We have here a
</p>
<p>fresh instance, of the advantage of having the command of

<p>a smooth tongue. We know, from good authority*, that
</p>
<p>he was endowed with " deep judgment," and blessed " with
</p>
<p>many singular and extraordinary graces." And, indeed, he
</p>
<p>must have been singularly eloquent, if, under the then ex-
</p>
<p>isting circumstances, he could dissuade Alexander from ex-
</p>
<p>ecuting his design of taking his life, after having proceeded
</p>
<p>such a length. But, not to insist on this, we are next told>
</p>
<p>that Alexander actually was prevailed on by the king's rh-
</p>
<p>S
</p>
<p>* The Translators of the Bible. See Preface,
</p>
<p>138
</p>
<p>toric, to grant him a respite till the Earl's pleasure should
</p>
<p>be known ; and that he went out for that purpose. Before
</p>
<p>leaving the apartment, however, he gave the king's person
</p>
<p>ih charge to Henderson. Now, what unaccountable con-
</p>
<p>duct was this ! According to all the three accounts, James
</p>
<p>had all along evinced the most undaunted fortitude. There
</p>
<p>is no evidence of his being afraid, even when the weapon
</p>
<p>was pointed to his breast. Henderson, on the contrary,
</p>
<p>" trembled," " quaked," was " abashed," and " astonished."
</p>
<p>Yet, to this silly half-dead wretch, does Alexander entrust
</p>
<p>the custody of the intrepid James the Sixth, whilst he went
</p>
<p>out to learn, whether the Earl would remit the sentence of
</p>
<p>death which he had passed upon him. It is but fair to state,
</p>
<p>indeed, that he first laid the king under some kind of re-
</p>
<p>straint, not to escape, till his return. But the precise tenor
</p>
<p>of this obligation, never can be ascertained. At the precog-
</p>
<p>nition, Henderson swore* That Alexander took " an oathe
</p>
<p>of the king, that he would not cry, nor open the window."
</p>
<p>At the trial, he says, this was merely a promise. " Alexan-
</p>
<p>der said to the king, Sir, you will not cry, nor open the
</p>
<p>window, while I come again ? And the king promised so
</p>
<p>to do." But, according to the Royal narrative, he did not
</p>
<p>even exact a promise* He only " saide to His Majesty, you
</p>
<p>must content yourself to have this man now your keeper,
</p>
<p>untill my coming backe." But whether it was an oath, or
</p>
<p>a promise, or an injunction, James was too well versed in
</p>
<p>casuistry, to be restrained by a forced obligation; so, though
</p>
<p>he did not open the window himself, he caused Henderson
</p>
<p>do it.
</p>
<p>That part of Henderson's story, in which he says, that
</p>
<p>so soon as Sir John Ramsay entered the closet, he (Hen-
</p>
<p>derson) ran down the back stair, and went home, to his
</p>
<p>own house, where he remained all the rest of the afternoon,
</p>
<p>as if nowise interested in the fate of his master's family, is

</p>
<p>highly improbable. Although he had seen the king's life
</p>
<p>attempted, and had left the place in the middle of the fray,
</p>
<p>whilst the event was still in suspense, he is quite careless of
</p>
<p>the result, and keeps at home till the evening; when he
</p>
<p>takes an airing on the bridge for an hour, as if nothing un-
</p>
<p>common had taken place.
</p>
<p>In passing through the court, too, on his way home, he
</p>
<p>saw his master, Gowry, standing on the South-Street, with-
</p>
<p>out the gate, armed, and seemingly about to interfere in the
</p>
<p>13$
</p>
<p>bustle. Yet although Henderson had just left the place,
</p>
<p>where he had seen the Earl's brother get his death's wound,
</p>
<p>he did not consider that as an affair worth acquainting him
</p>
<p>with, but steps away home. And although the Earl was about
</p>
<p>to enter the house, for the purpose of repressing the tumult,
</p>
<p>he does not request Henderson's assistance, though he
</p>
<p>doubtless considered him as the trustiest of all his servants.
</p>
<p>Whoever reflects on these particulars, together with his
</p>
<p>sitting chatting at home with his wife, w T hen all the rest of
</p>
<p>the town was in a hubbub : and his composedly taking his
</p>
<p>usual walk on the evening of such a day as that must have
</p>
<p>been in Perth, and that in the midst of rain too, are any
</p>
<p>thing but sceptics, if they believe his tale.
</p>
<p>This desertion on the part of Henderson, is far from
</p>
<p>being that unimportant circumstance, which it may appear
</p>
<p>to some. As it w T as a very surprising step, it must have o-
</p>
<p>riginated from some extraordinary cause. And fear, or a
</p>
<p>dread of personal harm, is the only one which readily pre-
</p>
<p>sents itself, as likely to occasion such conduct. But upon
</p>
<p>farther consideration we find, that it could not possibly be
</p>
<p>owing to this. For had that been the case, he certainly
</p>
<p>would have chosen some other place, to have concealed him-
</p>
<p>self in, than his own house, which seems to have been at no
</p>
<p>great distance, because, if wanted, he would naturally be
</p>
<p>sought for there, and there he would soon have been found.
</p>
<p>He says, that there were some persons in company with
</p>
<p>Gowry, when he passed him at the gate, but he did not
</p>
<p>know them. It appears from Christie's evidence, that these
</p>
<p>-were Thomas Cranston, servant to Gowry, Alexander and
</p>
<p>Harry Ruthven of Freeland, Hugh Moncrieff, brother to
</p>
<p>William Moncrieff of Moncrieff, and Patrick Eviot, bro-
</p>
<p>ther to the Laird of Balhousie. The first of these was fel-
</p>
<p>low servant with Henderson, being Gowry's principal do-
</p>
<p>mestic; the second and third were relations of Gowry's, and

<p>lived five miles off; the fourth was brother-in-law to one of
</p>
<p>the Ruthvens of Freeland ; his sister being married to Wil-
</p>
<p>liam Ruthven, and mother to the first Lord Ruthven of
</p>
<p>Freeland; and Moncrieff House is three miles distant from
</p>
<p>Perth ; the fifth was brother, as has been said, to Mr Eviot
</p>
<p>of Balhousie, not half a mile from Perth. Yet the Earl of
</p>
<p>Gowry's factor did not know any one of these ! But had
</p>
<p>Henderson said, that these were the people, whom he saw
</p>
<p>in Gowry's company, when he passed out at the gate, he
</p>
<p>S'2
</p>
<p>140
</p>
<p>might have committed himself, as they might have brought
</p>
<p>evidence to the contrary. He therefore evaded this danger,
</p>
<p>by mentioning no names. These gentlemen, indeed, were
</p>
<p>aJJ afterwards declared rebels, traitors, &c. and all fled, ex-
</p>
<p>cept Cranston, who was executed; so that, though they had
</p>
<p>been named by Henderson, they would have had no oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity of contradicting him. But at the time when he e-
</p>
<p>mitted his declaration, he could not foresee that, excepting
</p>
<p>with respect to Cranston.
</p>
<p>The real state of the matter seems to be, that he acted
</p>
<p>no part in the tragedy. And as in the narrative he was
</p>
<p>said to have been the principal character who survived, it
</p>
<p>of course was necessary to represent his part as being acted
</p>
<p>before the company assembled, and his exit taking place,
</p>
<p>unobserved by any one, excepting indeed Sir John Ramsay,
</p>
<p>who says, that when he entered the chamber, he saw a man,
</p>
<p>along with the king, and Mr Ruthven, but remembers no-
</p>
<p>thing of either his dress or physiognomy.
</p>
<p>That part of the story, which supposes tlie meeting of
</p>
<p>the two brothers, at this time, is extremely aukward. The
</p>
<p>king's death had previously been fully determined, else why
</p>
<p>strike at him with a dagger ? Now, though his eloquence
</p>
<p>might cause Alexander, to whom it was addressed, relent,
</p>
<p>and go down to consult his brother afresh : how came the
</p>
<p>Earl, who was not in the house, to know of this ? And how
</p>
<p>did each know in what precise minute the other was to be
</p>
<p>met with on the stairs ? And how could Alexander assure
</p>
<p>the king that " his life should be safe if he behaved himself
</p>
<p>quietly" ? There seems to be only one way of solving all
</p>
<p>these questions, and that is by supposing, all the difficulties
</p>
<p>were got over by the agency of the " magical characters and
</p>
<p>words of enchantment," in the " little close parchment bag,"
</p>
<p>which we have already heard of.

</p>
<p>a state of mind short of absolute insanity, would entrust the
</p>
<p>executive part of such an enterprise, as the murder of king
</p>
<p>James, to any person, without acquainting him with what
</p>
<p>was expected of him, has already been taken notice of. But
</p>
<p>the giving the king in charge to Henderson, after he had
</p>
<p>taken so decided a part in His Majesty's favour, as to wrench
</p>
<p>the dirk from Alexander when he " minted" to stab him^
</p>
<p>was a step, at least, equally preposterous.
</p>
<p>Ci Alexander very speedily returned," and brought the
</p>
<p>141
</p>
<p>king's final doom; from the Earl, we are to infer, for at
</p>
<p>his entering, he " sayde he could not mend it," consequent-
</p>
<p>ly, as he went out, evidently with the intention of bringing
</p>
<p>in the Earl for the accommodation of matters ; as he had
</p>
<p>seen, and conversed with him, and then returned with the
</p>
<p>death-warrant, instead of a pardon,  we may fairly presume,
</p>
<p>that this confirmation of the former sanguinary sentence,
</p>
<p>proceeded from Gowry. James says, that Alexander, when
</p>
<p>he "left the king in the little study, ranne down the
</p>
<p>stairs in great haste." Henderson, on the contrary, swears,
</p>
<p>That " he past not from the door as he believes." In com-?
</p>
<p>posing the discourse they should, at least, have compared
</p>
<p>notes. According to Henderson's account, unless the Earl
</p>
<p>came up to the door of the closet, the two brothers could
</p>
<p>not meet, and unless they did meet, the bloody order which
</p>
<p>Alexander carried back, could not come from the Earl,
</p>
<p>which evidently is the idea that is meant to be conveyed by
</p>
<p>this part of the story : and as Lennox tells us, that when the
</p>
<p>Earl left him, and the others, who were in the court looking
</p>
<p>for the king, he returned " incontinent." So that it is im-
</p>
<p>probable that he went up to the closet door.
</p>
<p>The mode in which Alexander is said to have proceed-
</p>
<p>ed to put the sentence in execution, sets all credibility at
</p>
<p>defiance. It appears in* the sequel, that James was the
</p>
<p>strongest man, Henderson had decidedly taken the king's
</p>
<p>part. The only chance which Alexander then had, of be-
</p>
<p>ing able to effect his purpose, must have been secured by
</p>
<p>taking His Majesty unawares : yet at his incoming, instead
</p>
<p>of instantly burying the dagger in his breast, he takes care
</p>
<p>to acquaint him with the dismal tidings, by casting " his
</p>
<p>Jiands abroad in a desperate manner," and exclaiming " he
</p>
<p>could not mend it, His Majesty behoved to die," and for
</p>
<p>that purpose proceeded to bind His Majesty's hands. This
</p>
<p>was virtually telling the king, By God, it is not in my pow-

</p>
<p>er, may it please your Majesty, to save your Majesty's life,
</p>
<p>my brother has resolved on taking it, and although I could
</p>
<p>willingly have spared your Majesty, yet he commands me
</p>
<p>to cut your throat. To prevent you, Sire, from making
</p>
<p>any resistance, it will be proper to pinion your Majesty :
</p>
<p>please then turn your arms behind your Majesty's back.
</p>
<p>Here is a garter for binding them ! James objected to this,
</p>
<p>refusing to be bound ; on which Alexander seized him by
</p>
<p>pjiQ or both hands. But here the forward youth found that
</p>
<p>142
</p>
<p>jhe had caught a Tarter ; for Henderson " pulled the gar-
</p>
<p>ter out of -his hands," and " His Majesty suddenly re-
</p>
<p>lieved himself of his gripps." We never heard but once
</p>
<p>of the poinard : Alexander now attempts to draw his sword,
</p>
<p>which was still in its scabbard, but the king seized his hand,
</p>
<p>and prevented that. Each now seized the other by the
</p>
<p>throat, and the king eventually proved the stoutest, for he
</p>
<p>w per force drove him" (Alexander) " to the window, which
</p>
<p>he had caused the other man to open." It may be worth
</p>
<p>while to notice here, that according to James's account, he
</p>
<p>had caused Henderson to open the window, while Alex-
</p>
<p>ander was out conversing with the Earl : but Henderson,
</p>
<p>in both his examinations, depones, that it was not until the
</p>
<p>king and Alexander were wrestling, that he opened the
</p>
<p>window.
</p>
<p>Another discrepancy of the same kind may likewise be
</p>
<p>noticed here. Lennox and Mar swear, that when the king
</p>
<p>thrust his head and shoulders out at the window, the hand
</p>
<p>had hold of his cheek and mouth. Henderson, on the con-
</p>
<p>trary, both at Falkland and Edinburgh, declares, that he
</p>
<p>took Alexander's hand from James's mouth, before he o-
</p>
<p>pened the window. Now these noblemen were standing on
</p>
<p>the street, at a considerable distance from the house ; the
</p>
<p>window is in the fourth story, and- was filled with wood in
</p>
<p>place of glass ; so that they could not be misled by their
</p>
<p>memory suggesting what actually happened before the win-
</p>
<p>dow was opened, as having taken place after. From such
</p>
<p>instances, we may learn what dependence to place on the
</p>
<p>evidence of such witnesses.
</p>
<p>That part of the narrative which represents Gowry as
</p>
<p>endeavouring to have the king left alone in his house, by
</p>
<p>persuading the attendants, that he had taken horse, and
</p>
<p>was away to Falkland, is at best a silly contrivance ; which,
</p>
<p>though it had succeeded, in the first instance, could have

</p>
<p>been of no real service. Indeed by getting rid of them, he
</p>
<p>might, in the mean time, have had leisure to butcher His
</p>
<p>Majesty, but how was that to serve him afterwards ? This
</p>
<p>could only be a very temporary shift. The courtiers could
</p>
<p>not proceed far on their way home, till they learned that the
</p>
<p>king was not on before : and on their arrival at Falkland,
</p>
<p>they would know it to be a certainty. Before midnight
</p>
<p>they would again have ranged themselves before Gowry's
</p>
<p>.gate in Perth, with a force sufficient to overturn every ob-
</p>
<p>143
</p>
<p>stacle, which he could put in their way, and demanded of
</p>
<p>him, how he had disposed on their sovereign. Then
</p>
<p>what purpose would have been served, by sending them
</p>
<p>away without the king ?
</p>
<p>Nor is this the only objection that occurs ft) that part of
</p>
<p>the story* The Earl, if he meant to impose on the king's
</p>
<p>servants, would surely have given his own porter instruc-
</p>
<p>tions how to act, as it must have been foreseen, that if any
</p>
<p>doubt of the king's departure should arise, he would have
</p>
<p>been applied to for intelligence. But so far was that from
</p>
<p>being done, that Christie depones, that he in the most une-
</p>
<p>quivocal terms stated to Lennox, Mar, and Gbwry, the
</p>
<p>impossibility of the king having left the place.
</p>
<p>The account of the manner in which Gowry procured
</p>
<p>the helmet from Henderson's house, as given by James, in
</p>
<p>another part of the discourse, which is pressed with insupe-
</p>
<p>rable difficulties, and consequently must invalidate the evi-
</p>
<p>dence of these witnesses who attest it as a fact. And it like-
</p>
<p>wise affords a remarkable instance of the difficulty there al-
</p>
<p>ways is, in making the several parts of such a fabrication
</p>
<p>as this is, fit one another.
</p>
<p>Thomas Erskin depones, that he and his brother James
</p>
<p>were at some distance without the court, when they heard
</p>
<p>the king cry from the window, and that they then ran to
</p>
<p>afford him assistance, when they met Gowry. Him they
</p>
<p>seized, and throwing him down, had some words with him,'
</p>
<p>when his servants interposed, and rescued him. He then
</p>
<p>went into the town for armour, as he had none at that time*
</p>
<p>All this must have taken up a considerable space of time.
</p>
<p>Ramsay, again, was standing at the stable door, when the
</p>
<p>king called from the window. Immediately he came into
</p>
<p>the court, and ran up the turnpike stair, and into the cham-
</p>
<p>ber, the door of which Henderson had just opened and the
</p>
<p>instant Ramsay entered, Henderson went out, and passed

</p>
<p>precipitately down the stair, and out at the gate, without
</p>
<p>stopping. All this, according to Ramsay's and Hender-
</p>
<p>son's depositions, could not occupy more than two minutes i
</p>
<p>yet in that short period, the Erskins came from a place at
</p>
<p>some distance, after he heard the king's voice, had a scuffle
</p>
<p>with the Earl, and then with his servants, at the gate ; the
</p>
<p>Earl went to Henderson's house in the town, procured the
</p>
<p>steel bonnet, returned with it, and was standing at the gatej
</p>
<p>as Henderson says, that on going furth, he saw Gowry
</p>
<p>standing at the gate, with his helmet on his head* This
</p>
<p>requires but a short comment. It is impossible that it could
</p>
<p>have happened as stated by the witnesses.
</p>
<p>On this occasion too, Thomas Erskin informs us of a
</p>
<p>piece of very istrange conduct in himself and his brother
</p>
<p>James. He heard the king call from the window of an up-
</p>
<p>per apartment, fye, help ! they are murdering me !
</p>
<p>In such an emergency, there Certainly was not a second of
</p>
<p>time to lose. One would have expected, that nothing should
</p>
<p>divert them from giving His Majesty instant relief. They
</p>
<p>accordingly proceeded to do so, by running towards the
</p>
<p>house. But on their way thither, seeing Gowry standing
</p>
<p>before his own door, they deferred assisting the king, and
</p>
<p>set upon the Earl, although unarmed, and noway con-
</p>
<p>cerned in the matter, as far as they could perceive. We
</p>
<p>shall have occasion afterwards to account for this suspicious
</p>
<p>conduct.
</p>
<p>The story of notary Sprott, only, now remains to be in-
</p>
<p>vestigated. It seems never to have been believed by any one
</p>
<p>of either party. Even Spottiswoodj though he officiated at
</p>
<p>Sprctt's trial as a judge, and at his execution as a clergy-
</p>
<p>man, and pretended to believe in Gowry's guilt ; avows his
</p>
<p>incredulity in this matter. He says " the confession
</p>
<p>of Sprctt  i  seemed a very fiction, and to be a mere in-
</p>
<p>veiii/loii of the man's own brain." And Lord Cromarty,
</p>
<p>though a furious party-man, and a professed believer in
</p>
<p>Gowry's and Logan's guilt, could not prevail on himself to
</p>
<p>insert the letter from Logan to Gowry, which forms part
</p>
<p>of Sprott's confession, when copying the rest of that con-
</p>
<p>ission: the tragedy being so evident, when this copy and
</p>
<p>the one produced at Logan's trial are compared. Yet
</p>
<p>Cromarty's pretensions, as a writer, to ingenuousness or
</p>
<p>honesty are truly, very slender, where his iavourite system is
</p>
<p>in question.
</p>
<p>But indeed it is impossible for any one, minutely to ex-

</p>
<p>amine the several circumstances, connected with Sprott's
</p>
<p>narrative, without being convinced, that from beginning to
</p>
<p>end, it is a fabrication.
</p>
<p>It is uncertain, whether James's friends originally brought
</p>
<p>forward Sprott, or if they only seized the opportunity, which
</p>
<p>his folly afforded them, of corroborating their own old story,
</p>
<p>of the guilt of the two brothers. Indeed there is reason for
</p>
<p>supposing, that whichsoever of these two was the case, some
</p>
<p>145
</p>
<p>of the ministers had their own private ends principally ia
</p>
<p>view, in driving on the infatuated wretch to destruction.
</p>
<p>History throws some light on this part of the subject, but
</p>
<p>still the path is so obscure that we must chiefly depend on
</p>
<p>conjecture for our guide ; in which case we must either sup-
</p>
<p>pose that when Sprott first broached the matter, he did it
</p>
<p>merely to court attention, and with the view of obtaining
</p>
<p>a reward for this fresh confirmation, of Gowry's guilt, and
</p>
<p>king James's innocence ; or that he made no such declara-
</p>
<p>tion at all, till this confession was wrung from him, by tor-
</p>
<p>ture. Balmerino again being a minister, and therefore in-
</p>
<p>terested in shielding his master from the infamy of the mur-
</p>
<p>der at Perth, and having purchased the estate of Restalrig
</p>
<p>from Logan, the price of which remained unpaid, he ex-
</p>
<p>pected to save his money, by procuring a grant of the es-
</p>
<p>tate from the crown, should he bring about its forfeiture by
</p>
<p>convicting Logan of treason. However, before he could
</p>
<p>bring this to bear, James was obliged by the intrigues of
</p>
<p>Cecil, Spottiswood, and Dunbar, to discard him. Dun-
</p>
<p>bar then stept into his shoes ; and with the same views,
</p>
<p>pushed on Logan's attainder.
</p>
<p>This account of Sprott's discovery is combated by a
</p>
<p>number of circumstances.
</p>
<p>In the first place, It appears from the letters written by
</p>
<p>Logan, in, answer to one which we are to suppose had he re-
</p>
<p>ceived from Gowry, that Logan, at the request of the Earl,
</p>
<p>had returned his (the Earl's) letter, after perusing it, that
</p>
<p>his Lordship might be satisfied, as to its not falling into im-
</p>
<p>proper hands, and for the same reason, Logan desires his
</p>
<p>answer to be returned. Yet Sprott pretended to have found
</p>
<p>both these letters among Logan's papers. This is a gross
</p>
<p>blunder. However, by the time that Logan's trial took
</p>
<p>place, the mistake had been discovered; Gowry's letter
</p>
<p>therefore disappeared; and even Logan's answer was ma-
</p>

</p>
<p>terially altered, to serye anotjier purpose.
</p>
<p>Secondly, Logan's answer, as recast for his trial, was
</p>
<p>dated July 29, only six days before the attempt on the king.
</p>
<p>Bowr returned from Perth, after delivering the answer to
</p>
<p>Gowry, on the 3d or 4th, only one or two days before the
</p>
<p>5th of August, on which day, he, no doubt, informed Lo-
</p>
<p>gan, that Gowry's attempt was to be made, and consequent-
</p>
<p>ly, that their arrival at Fastcastle might be expected on that,
</p>
<p>or the following day ; yet, instead of waiting their arrival
</p>
<p>T
</p>
<p>146
</p>
<p>there, as he had promised to do, in his letter to the Earl,
</p>
<p>Sprott informs us that he went away next morning, after
</p>
<p>Bowr's return, and remained in Lothian till the ljth.
</p>
<p>Thirdly, In one of Logan's letters to the unknown ac-
</p>
<p>complice, he desires him to accompany the Earl and his
</p>
<p>brother Alexander in the boat to Fastcastle. From which
</p>
<p>circumstance, it appears that he resided in Perth or that
</p>
<p>neighbourhood. Yet, in a letter written from the Canon-
</p>
<p>gate of Edinburgh, dated July 18, 1600, to his servant
</p>
<p>Laird Bowr, he desires him to " hasten west, as he was
</p>
<p>ill at ease," though he had, that same day, written a letter
</p>
<p>at Fastcastle, and dispatched it by Bowr, to the same un-
</p>
<p>known correspondent. Now, there could be no meaning in
</p>
<p>desiring Bowr to " hasten west," unless he was in the cast
</p>
<p>of Edinburgh, which could not be t}ie pase, if at Perth, or
</p>
<p>that neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>Fourthly, He had dispatched Bowr from Fastcastle, on
</p>
<p>the 1 8th of July, with the letter of that date to the unknown
</p>
<p>person, yet we find him the same day, writing from Ca*
</p>
<p>nongate, to this Bowr, as if sjill at Fastcastle.
</p>
<p>Fifthly, The absurdity of sending a letter to Bowr at a
</p>
<p>place, whence he had that same day been dispatched, is if
</p>
<p>possible exceeded by that of sending a letter to him at all ;
</p>
<p>especially when the writer's life was endangered by a disco-*
</p>
<p>very of the contents. For we learn from Logan's indict-
</p>
<p>ment, that Bowr could not read, but was obliged to employ
</p>
<p>another person to read all writings sent, or belonging to him.
</p>
<p>Vet though Logan had numberless opportunities, when liv-
</p>
<p>ing in the house with him, of imparting his secrets verbally
</p>
<p>to this menial, and might have done it that very morning,
</p>
<p>so soon as he gets forty miles distant, he prefers intimating
</p>
<p>to him in writing, his concern in the plot, and his expecta-
</p>
<p>tion of Dirlton estate as Jus reward, though he knew that
</p>
<p>before Bowr could learn their import, the contents behoved

</p>
<p>to be imparted to some third person ; perhaps the first ac-
</p>
<p>quaintance he should meet with. This behaviour is the
</p>
<p>more to be wondered at in Logan, that according to ano-
</p>
<p>ther part of the history, we find him on other occasions,
</p>
<p>extremely cautious. He does not allow Gowry, though the
</p>
<p>principal in the plot, to retain his letter, though only ad-
</p>
<p>vising the Earl of his accession to the Earl's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>And he seems to exhort Gowry to take care, that the other
</p>
<p>persons engaged in the enterprise be deserving of conn*-
</p>
<p>i47
</p>
<p>dence ! and particularly that his brother Alexander beware
</p>
<p>of blabbing any thing relating to it. He likewise forbears
</p>
<p>Erefixing the third conspirator's address to the letters sent
</p>
<p>im, and even studiously avoids mentioning his name, when
</p>
<p>alluding to him in the letter to Gowry.
</p>
<p>But Sixthly, These letters did not make their appear-*
</p>
<p>ance for upwards of two months after Sprott was apprehend"
</p>
<p>ed, and the original of Gowry's he never pretended to shew,
</p>
<p>so that whert the others made their appearance, they were
</p>
<p>looked upon as forgeries by many people. The letters from
</p>
<p>Logan were indeed sworn to be holograph by him, by se-
</p>
<p>veral respectable witnesses; But we are told that Sprott
</p>
<p>was so celebrated for imitating the writing of other people,
</p>
<p>that none could certainly tell whether the letters were real-
</p>
<p>ly written by Logan or not. However, before Sprott's ex-
</p>
<p>ecution he set that matter at rest. First, he confessed, that
</p>
<p>the letters were merely his own fabrications; afterwards
</p>
<p>when Drinbar returned into the country, and had some con-
</p>
<p>versation With him, he half retracted, by declaring that the
</p>
<p>plot did exists but he still owned that the letters were for-
</p>
<p>geries. It is hot at all unlikely, that Sprott did not at first
</p>
<p>pretend to know any thing of the conspiracy, as was given
</p>
<p>out, but that Balmeririo, for reasons which have been al-
</p>
<p>ready stated, contrived the story, and fixed on Sprott as
</p>
<p>a very proper tool* from his having the inspection of Lo-
</p>
<p>gan's papers. Without this supposition it is difficult to ac-
</p>
<p>count for Sprott's continuing in prison two months, undergo-
</p>
<p>ing the excruciating torture of the Boots, and avoiding being
</p>
<p>ensnared by the captious questions of the privy councillors ;
</p>
<p>and yet when afterwards enlarged from jail, and having his
</p>
<p>legs healed* giving his assent to the whole. Historians tell
</p>
<p>us, that this was brought about by the minion Dunbar pro-
</p>
<p>mising to provide for his family after his death, if he father-
</p>
<p>ed the confession, assuring him, at the same time, that he

</p>
<p>would certainly be executed, whatever the nature of his de-
</p>
<p>claration should be, whether he adhered to the truth, or fa-
</p>
<p>voured the king and his friends, by impeaching Logan.
</p>
<p>But other people give a very different account of the matter.
</p>
<p>They tell us that Dunbar prevailed on him to fabricate the
</p>
<p>letters, and cajoled him into submission to a trial, the pre-
</p>
<p>liminaries of a public execution, and an adherence to his
</p>
<p>confession, even with the rope about his neck, under the
</p>
<p>assurance, that in the instant when about to be thrown over,
</p>
<p>T2
</p>
<p>148
</p>
<p>he (Duflbaf) Would take care to tender him the king's par-*
</p>
<p>don ; but that the crafty courtier, recollecting how they
</p>
<p>were bit, some years before, by Edmonston of Duntreath,
</p>
<p>and knowing that dead men tell no tales, thought it just as
</p>
<p>well to be quit of him.
</p>
<p>Seventhly, Before the day of execution came, it was giv-
</p>
<p>en out, that Sprott would testify his adherence to his nar-
</p>
<p>rative by a sign, even after he was thrown from the ladder.
</p>
<p>And it is related that that sign was then found to be three
</p>
<p>claps with his hands. But if any stress is to be laid upon
</p>
<p>the motions of the body in the moment of dissolution, his
</p>
<p>clapping his hands might as well be interpreted into an ex-
</p>
<p>pression of indignation for being tricked out of his life by a
</p>
<p>villain, as into a confirmation of what he knew well to be
</p>
<p>one of the most diabolical of Falsehoods. Cromarty says
</p>
<p>that this " action" was " strange, and in a manner marvel-
</p>
<p>lous." And truly so it was, for his lordship tells us, that
</p>
<p>it was " when he had hung a pretty space" that " he lift up
</p>
<p>his hands a good height, and clapped them together aloud
</p>
<p>three several times, to the great wonder and admiration of
</p>
<p>all the beholders." Now Johnston, a contemporary histo-
</p>
<p>rian, informs us that Sprott's hands were tied behind his
</p>
<p>back, when he was hanged. This story, though a little out
</p>
<p>of the common track, to be sure, is not more " marvellous"
</p>
<p>than that of the man who, after being beheaded, swam a-
</p>
<p>cross a river, with that same head in his teeth.
</p>
<p>Eighthly, In the second edition of the letter to Gow-
</p>
<p>rv, there is no mention made of the ships and venison which
</p>
<p>are hinted at in the first edition, as expected from England.
</p>
<p>This seems to have been inadvertantly inserted in the first
</p>
<p>edition, with the view of impressing the world with the no-
</p>
<p>tion of there having been a secret understanding with the
</p>
<p>English court ; but on reflection, it would soon occur, that
</p>
<p>those who had been statesmen under Elizabeth at the time,

</p>
<p>would take offence at, and deny this : so it was necessary to
</p>
<p>expunge it.
</p>
<p>Ninthly, The very condemnation and execution of Sprott
</p>
<p>is strong presumption of the falsity of the story. What
</p>
<p>judge would so much as have thought of hanging a man for
</p>
<p>forbearing to reveal what was only constructive treason, in
</p>
<p>an accessary, before conviction of the principal ? What
</p>
<p>could be the inducement for inflicting the severest punish-
</p>
<p>ment of the law on an insignificant procurator in a small
</p>
<p>village, merely for not divulging his client's secrets, when
</p>
<p>149
</p>
<p>the discovery would have been his certain ruin, without be-
</p>
<p>ing beneficial to any one ? (For even taking the account of
</p>
<p>the affair, as published in Sprott's confession, it is very im-
</p>
<p>probable, that he was acquainted with the secret, till Gow*.
</p>
<p>ry was slain, and the danger over.) What, we say, could
</p>
<p>be the reason of such procedure, but a wish to blindfold the
</p>
<p>world, and prevent Sprott's versatility from occasioning any
</p>
<p>obstacles in prosecuting Logan's attainder ? Had there beer*
</p>
<p>any wish to have the truth laid before the public^ Sprott'
</p>
<p>would have been reserved as the only living evidence nat
</p>
<p>could be brought on Logan's trial ; and by the fair < n-
</p>
<p>viction of Logan, and consequently of Gowry, the public
</p>
<p>mind would have been set at rest, with respect to the mys-
</p>
<p>terious affair at Perth; and the heavy load of obloquy re-^
</p>
<p>moved from the characters of the king and his assistants. The
</p>
<p>Earl's. three servants were hanged for being his accomplices in
</p>
<p>the treasonable attempt on the king, before he, the princi-
</p>
<p>pal, was convicted ; and when, if nothing unfair was design-
</p>
<p>ed, their testimony must have been invaluable; and though
</p>
<p>much fault was found with that step, yet; here we rind one"
</p>
<p>taken exactly parallel.
</p>
<p>Tenthly, The slight acquaintance that Gowry and Res-
</p>
<p>talrig behoved to have of each other, is another strong pre-
</p>
<p>sumption that Sprott's story is a falsehood. The Earl, when
</p>
<p>he set out on his travels, was but a very young man, and
</p>
<p>till a short time before that, he was only a younger brother,
</p>
<p>and being under the tuition of Mr, afterwards Professor,
</p>
<p>Rollock, and Mr Bruce of Kinnaird, the two most celebra-
</p>
<p>ted clergymen of their day, who were careful to instil the
</p>
<p>principles of sound morality and piety into their pupil, we
</p>
<p>may rest assured, that before he went abroad, no great in-
</p>
<p>timacy could subsist between him and Logan, a man far ad-
</p>
<p>vanced in life, and of the most dissolute manners. After
</p>
<p>his return, [May 20], only six weeks elapsed, before the

</p>
<p>beginning of July, when Sprott says the correspondence
</p>
<p>relative to the plot was carrying on : a short space of time,
</p>
<p>truly, considering how much of it must have been taken up
</p>
<p>by his private affairs, after an absence of six years. Indeed,
</p>
<p>the shortness of the period, only eleven weeks, from the
</p>
<p>20th of May, when he arrived at Ruthven Castle, to the
</p>
<p>5th of August, when the attempt was said to have been made,
</p>
<p>is, of itself, no weak argument against the probability that
</p>
<p>such a conspiracy did exist
</p>
<p>U6
</p>
<p>Eleventhly, The ludicrous attention, which, at the trial
</p>
<p>6f Logan's bones, was paid to the observance of all the mi-
</p>
<p>nute legal forms, was no less strict, than at the trial of the bo-
</p>
<p>dies of the two brothers. The messengers and their witnes-
</p>
<p>ses were brought into court, and made oath, that they really
</p>
<p>executed the summons, and Letters of Relaxation, freeing
</p>
<p>Robert Logan, eldest son to the deceased Restalrig, from the
</p>
<p>Horn ; so that he might freely appear; and make his defence.
</p>
<p>And though they knew that the elder Logan had been dead
</p>
<p>some years, they repeatedly called on him to come and sist
</p>
<p>himself in court. All which proceedings were engrossed
</p>
<p>at length, in the Records. There could be no harm in all
</p>
<p>this. But it appears very absurd, when contrasted with
</p>
<p>their conduct in depriving themselves of the benefit of
</p>
<p>Sprott's evidence.
</p>
<p>So much presumptive evidence as is here brought forward
</p>
<p>in support of the innocence of the two brothers, seldom can
</p>
<p>be produced to establish a fact. On duly weighing it, no
</p>
<p>Unprejudiced mind can entertain a doubt.
</p>
<p>However; for the sake of affording more general satis-
</p>
<p>faction, we shall now consider the fourth system, or that
</p>
<p>which supposes the whole a conspiracy of James and his ad-
</p>
<p>herents, to exterminate and rob the house of Gowry, and
</p>
<p>that without any just provocation;
</p>
<p>In investigating this hypothesis; the question that first
</p>
<p>presents itself is, What inducement could James and his a-
</p>
<p>bettors have, to perpetrate a deed of such enormity ?
</p>
<p>We have already seen, that James's character was of
</p>
<p>that stamp, which befits a man for deeds the most cruel, and
</p>
<p>villanous that possibly can be conceived. So that neither
</p>
<p>feeling for the sufferings of others, nor regard to his own
</p>
<p>reputation, had restraint upon his actions.
</p>
<p>Again, for a number of years, he had been struggling
</p>
<p>to abolish Presbytery, and set up Episcopacy in Scotland.

<p>On this subject there had been much keen Contention betwixt
</p>
<p>him and a part of the clergy* who disdained to court Roy-
</p>
<p>al favour at the expense of what they conceived to be their
</p>
<p>duty. At the time of Gowry's return; His Majesty had
</p>
<p>nearly succeeded in effecting a complete ehange. A num-
</p>
<p>151
</p>
<p>ber of the ministers, indeed, still refused to submit, bu|
</p>
<p>they were without a head among the nobility, none of whom
</p>
<p>dared to disoblige their monarch, more especially as he was
</p>
<p>soon to succeed to the crown of England, when he would
</p>
<p>Jiave it in his power amply to repay the services of his
</p>
<p>friends, and resent the actions of such of his subjects, as he
</p>
<p>had found refractory. Gowry, upon his return from his
</p>
<p>travels, was precisely what the popular party in the Kirk
</p>
<p>wanted for a leader. Being opulent, he had it in his power
</p>
<p>to be independent, at a time when the chief of his compeers
</p>
<p>were pensioners to a man who himself lived on charity*
</p>
<p>His house had long been remarkable for an attachment
</p>
<p>to the Protestant religion ; in particular, his father, Earl
</p>
<p>William, lost his head for his exertions in the cause of
</p>
<p>liberty. John had been educated under his father's eye,
</p>
<p>by Messrs Bruce and Rollock, both staunch Presbyterians,
</p>
<p>who zealously opposed James's darling scheme of church
</p>
<p>government, to the end of their lives. Under such precep-
</p>
<p>tors, there can be no doubt, that the religious principles,
</p>
<p>in which the young Earl was educated, were strictly Puri-
</p>
<p>tanical ; principles which he seems not to have abandoned in
</p>
<p>his riper years, although they had by that time become un-
</p>
<p>courtly, and of course unfashionable. For on his way home
</p>
<p>from Italy, not quite a year before his death, he resided se-<
</p>
<p>veral months at Geneva, in the house of Theodore Beza,
</p>
<p>the chief of the Presbyterians, who, we are told, held him
</p>
<p>in such estimation, that he never mentioned his untimely
</p>
<p>death without shedding tears; and who sent an offer of en-
</p>
<p>tertainment in his house to the two younger brothers, when
</p>
<p>they went into exile,
</p>
<p>If the Earl was unfriendly to James's system of church-
</p>
<p>government, it appears from Calderwood's M. S. History,
</p>
<p>that in civil affairs he was not more complaisant. For at a
</p>
<p>convention of the states, which was held, during the short

</p>
<p>ppace that intervened, from his return to Scotland, till his
</p>
<p>death, we hear of his opposing the court in some of its op-
</p>
<p>pressive modes of levying taxes ; and of the courtiers whis-
</p>
<p>pering among themselves, that his destruction was resolved
</p>
<p>on in consequence.
</p>
<p>Peaceably to submit to opposition from any subject, es-
</p>
<p>pecially in any thing relating to prerogative, was the last
</p>
<p>thing that James could think off; he having no conception
</p>
<p>of a limited monarchy ; but, on the contrary, both in prin-
</p>
<p>152
</p>
<p>ciple and practice, avowed that the king is above all law.
</p>
<p>So that, the line of conduct which he had chalked out for
</p>
<p>himself rendered the destruction of the house of Ruthven,
</p>
<p>not so much a matter of choice as of necessity. But he had
</p>
<p>other motives, besides envy and ambition, for cutting off this
</p>
<p>family. Had these been his only incentives, perhaps he
</p>
<p>might have been contented with the destruction of the Earl
</p>
<p>alone. But being much embarrassed in pecuniary affairs,
</p>
<p>living partly on a pension from the English Queen, and
</p>
<p>having a numerous assemblage of ravenous parasites about
</p>
<p>his court; every one of whom seems to have depended on
</p>
<p>him for subsistence ; and many of whom, seem to have been
</p>
<p>disposed to go any length, in assisting him to provide for
</p>
<p>them ; he was at times, put to pitiful shifts, to hide his po-
</p>
<p>verty. On the other hand, the family of Gowry was very
</p>
<p>rich. Here then, was, a fair opening for those unprincipled
</p>
<p>ruffians, to gratify their malice, ambition, and avarice, at
</p>
<p>one and the same time ; for, by destroying the Ruthven fa-
</p>
<p>mily, they supplied their wants, at the expense of those
</p>
<p>whom they considered as their enemies.
</p>
<p>It may be urged, that, even admitting this, it is very
</p>
<p>probable that James would either have preferred a public
</p>
<p>trial before a packed court on a fabricated charge of some
</p>
<p>crime, as he did in Earl William's case, or private assassi-
</p>
<p>nation, to this method of cutting off Gowry. But the mode
</p>
<p>adopted was preferable to either of these in several respects.
</p>
<p>The universal execration vented against those, whq had any
</p>
<p>hand in Earl William's death, might well deter the majority
</p>
<p>of the nobility from again engaging in a similar undertaking.
</p>
<p>Perhaps too, it was impossible to devise a method of fixing
</p>
<p>a crime of sufficient magnitude upon Gowry. For though
</p>
<p>a kind of sham conviction of treason was made out, partly
</p>
<p>by overstrained inferences, and partly by manifest perjury,
</p>
<p>yet this was not attempted till after his death. Had he been

</p>
<p>allowed any thing like even the shadow of a trial, whilst
</p>
<p>alive, he could have resisted these falsehoods, and have re-
</p>
<p>presented facts in a different light.
</p>
<p>It may be said, that James put many persons to death,
</p>
<p>on a charge of witchcraft, and what, it may be asked, hin-
</p>
<p>dered him from having recourse to that method, if no better
</p>
<p>occurred, of legally taking off Gowry ? But before follow-
</p>
<p>ing any course, it is proper to observe all its bearings ; anc}
</p>
<p>in the present case, besides, there was danger not merely
</p>
<p>153
</p>
<p>of the accused escaping; but of his accusers subjecting therii-
</p>
<p>selves to ridicule. For the defence which John Earl of
</p>
<p>Gowry would have made from an accusation of sorcery,
</p>
<p>would certainly have been of a kind very different, from
</p>
<p>that of the ignorant old women, who were the usual objects
</p>
<p>of James's superstitious cruelty. Nor is this alL Supposing
</p>
<p>Gowry convicted of magic, it would have been difficult and
</p>
<p>dangerous, perhaps impossible, for all the power that James
</p>
<p>possessed to execute the sentence. The Earl was a distin-
</p>
<p>guished favourite of Elizabeth, Queen of England, on which
</p>
<p>account, James would not dare, openly, to lift his hand a-
</p>
<p>gainst him. He was no less the darling of his countrymen,
</p>
<p>and James, though he had long before this, begun, syste-
</p>
<p>matically to encroach on the liberties of the country, still
</p>
<p>wanted the means of promptly executing his arbitrary mea-
</p>
<p>sures, afforded by a standing army : and though the people
</p>
<p>of Scotland, at that period, were far from having the same
</p>
<p>notions of liberty, that now prevail, they were by no means
</p>
<p>insensible to the exertions made in their cause, by the house
</p>
<p>of Ruthven ; and they often testified their gratitude and at-
</p>
<p>tachment. It was only sixteen years before this, indeed,
</p>
<p>that James beheaded William, the first Earl, merely because
</p>
<p>he opposed his unconstitutional government. But then, he
</p>
<p>found it necessary to do this precipitately, and in one of the
</p>
<p>strongholds belonging to the crown ; and notwithstanding
</p>
<p>all this caution an attempt was made, by the country to
</p>
<p>rescue him.
</p>
<p>So far back as A.- D. 1 544, we find, that when Arran,
</p>
<p>at the instigation of cardinal Beaton, directed William Lord
</p>
<p>Ruthven to be turned out of his office of provost of Perth,
</p>
<p>the inhabitants of that city rose, armed themselves, and re-
</p>
<p>pulsed Chartris of Kinfauns, who was appointed to succeed
</p>
<p>him, killing a number of his followers, and by that means,
</p>
<p>retained Ruthven in the mayoralty.

</p>
<p>And, amongst a number of other instances, we find,
</p>
<p>that the town-council annually elected John, provost, dur-
</p>
<p>ing the five years he was abroad. And when the townsmen
</p>
<p>learned that he and his brother were slain, August 5, they
</p>
<p>seem to have resolved to sacrifice the murderers, to their
</p>
<p>own attachment to the family.
</p>
<p>And supposing, still farther, that Gowry had been con-*
</p>
<p>demned and executed for witchcraft; though the malice of
</p>
<p>his enemies might have been gratified, so far, yet by that
</p>
<p>154
</p>
<p>mode of procedure, nothing was afforded to satisfy their a*
</p>
<p>varice. The heritable property was no otherwise affected,
</p>
<p>than by passing to the next in succession of the family;
</p>
<p>The same objection holds against secret assassination.
</p>
<p>Had the Earl been taken out of the way, by that means,
</p>
<p>there were still other three brothers, besides sisters, alive,
</p>
<p>which rendered the extermination of the family, by this
</p>
<p>method, tedious, uncertain, and liable to detection. Long
</p>
<p>before this time, James had tried both these ways of making
</p>
<p>off with his obnoxious subjects. Mains and Drumquhasil
</p>
<p>were murdered, under the semblance of justice, by means
</p>
<p>of suborned witnesses^ The Earl of Murray was privately
</p>
<p>assassinated by Huntly, under the authority of a secret war-
</p>
<p>rant by James* Now, although His Majesty, by these con-
</p>
<p>trivances, got quit of his enemies; yet his villany was com-
</p>
<p>pletely exposed by succeeding occurrences : a consequence
</p>
<p>which it was prudent to avoid, where the object of his re-
</p>
<p>sentment was held in such estimation, by a neighbouring
</p>
<p>powerful sovereign, a numerous vassalage, and a great ma-
</p>
<p>jority of his countrymen.
</p>
<p>Such are the motives which may have actuated James
</p>
<p>and his associates to adopt this mode of exterminating the
</p>
<p>principal branch of the Ruthvens. And the following cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances warrant us in presuming that they certainly
</p>
<p>did so.
</p>
<p>In the first place, It has already been observed, that it
</p>
<p>was reported at that time, that a few days before the affair at
</p>
<p>Perth, the king wrote to the Earl, inviting him to visit
</p>
<p>Falkland, and there spend some time, in the diversion of the
</p>
<p>chace ; and that the card of invitation was found in Gowry's
</p>
<p>pocket after his death. We have no positive proof of this ;
</p>
<p>but the manner of Alexander's appearance there, as related
</p>
<p>by the king himself, seems to corroborate that report. His
</p>
<p>hanging on the king all morning, as related in the discourse,
</p>

</p>
<p>countenances this supposition very much. Had Alexan-
</p>
<p>der's errand merely been to invite the king to come and take
</p>
<p>possession of " a pose," less time than five hours would have
</p>
<p>been sufficient to determine whether he would go or not :
</p>
<p>and after he had taken his resolution, Alexander must have
</p>
<p>been very impertinent, indeed, to continue urging him to
</p>
<p>leave off before the end of the chace; an event which might
</p>
<p>have been expected every moment. The fact seems to be
</p>
<p>this ; The king had sent for Gowry, or his brother Alexan-
</p>
<p>155
</p>
<p>der, to Falkland that morning, for the purpose of covering
</p>
<p>his own design upon them, by representing whichsoever of
</p>
<p>them accepted of the invitation, as having come for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of drawing His Majesty into the snare.
</p>
<p>Secondly, The number of attendants, who went to Perth
</p>
<p>with the king, on this occasion, affords strong presumption
</p>
<p>that something more was in view, than merely to rob one
</p>
<p>man of his money, who was already bound and in confine-
</p>
<p>ment. And the eagerness manifested by the Royal Party,
</p>
<p>to diminish the account of their numbers, is evidence that
</p>
<p>they were aware of this. They had no occasion to bring
</p>
<p>this subject on the carpet at all, far less to strive to conceal
</p>
<p>the truth, (as we know that they certainly did,) if they had
</p>
<p>no sinister views,
</p>
<p>James, in his manifesto, says, that his whole train did not
</p>
<p>exceed fifteen persons in number. Lennox and Mar men-
</p>
<p>tion only twelve attendants who accompanied the king into
</p>
<p>Gowry's hall. Mr Rynd, too, swore, That in "his opinion
</p>
<p>the king's company was within a dozen of men." But per-
</p>
<p>haps another stroke or two of the hangman's maul on the
</p>
<p>wedges of Mr Rynd's boots, would have struck off a few
</p>
<p>more from this number. How many persons accompanied
</p>
<p>His Majesty to Perth on this occasion, we pretend not to
</p>
<p>ascertain : but we know of twenty, viz. Lennox, Mar, Inch-
</p>
<p>affray, Lindores, the three Erskins, Orchil, Balgowan,
</p>
<p>Ramsay, Harris, William Stewart, John Murray, John
</p>
<p>Hamilton, Finlay Tailzies, George Wilson, Robert Cak
</p>
<p>braith, Robert Brown, and the two Bogs. It is very pro-
</p>
<p>bable, that the number was much larger, as several of the
</p>
<p>above only came to our knowledge fortuitously. For in-
</p>
<p>stance, we never would have heard of Finlay Tailzies, who
</p>
<p>perhaps was clerk of the kitchen, had not Inchaffray inad-
</p>
<p>vertently acquainted us that he was one of that division
</p>
<p>which overtook him at Strathmiglo. Again, we should

</p>
<p>have known of no more than two Erskins being in the com-
</p>
<p>pany, viz. Thomas and James, had not Cromarty informed
</p>
<p>us, that he saw an attestation, in the hand-writing of George
</p>
<p>Erskin of Invertile, another brother, stating, that he " then"
</p>
<p>i. e. when the magical characters were abstracted from Gow-
</p>
<p>ry's person, received them from his brother Thomas, who,
</p>
<p>we are told, " did take" them " out of the Earl of Gowry's
</p>
<p>girdle."
</p>
<p>This number, however, was of itself, fully sufficient to
</p>
<p>U2
</p>
<p>156
</p>
<p>overpower Gowry, and his servants, taken, as they were,
</p>
<p>unawares. But in case more assistance should have been
</p>
<p>necessary, the Murrays were at hand. And it does not
</p>
<p>appear, that these were kept as a corps de reserve ; for we
</p>
<p>find a servant of Tullibardine's in the chamber, immediately
</p>
<p>after Gowry was killed : and it is very probable, that he
</p>
<p>assisted in the murder, as he was wounded in attempting
</p>
<p>to prevent Go wry's servants or friends from entering the
</p>
<p>room, at least he gave out so : and in sharing the plunder,
</p>
<p>some of the best articles, as the baronies of Ruthven and
</p>
<p>Scone, and the SherrifFalty of Perth, fell to the Murrays.
</p>
<p>Thirdly, In the number of James's servants who came
</p>
<p>to Perth with him, we find several whom we would sup-?
</p>
<p>pose it was not customary to carry with him on excur-?
</p>
<p>sions of this kind. For instance, the two Bogs, the one
</p>
<p>porter, and the other butler, were the very last of his do-*
</p>
<p>mestics whom we should expect to hear of following, when
</p>
<p>he meant to be absent only a few hours. But butlers and
</p>
<p>porters are usually stout, and often daring fellows ; it was
</p>
<p>therefore prudent for James to have people of that descrip-
</p>
<p>tion in his band, as it was uncertain what occasion there
</p>
<p>might be for their services, in such an enterprise. And in-
</p>
<p>deed it is difficult to conceive what purpose these persons
</p>
<p>were designed for at this time, unless it was to assist in the
</p>
<p>assassination of the Ruthvens, It was not. their business to
</p>
<p>attend the king's person ; and they could not be wanted for
</p>
<p>apprehending, and securing the strange man ; Alexander
</p>
<p>Ruthven having done that by himself, the evening before.
</p>
<p>He was still to make one of the company; and if more as-
</p>
<p>sistance should be wanted the municipality of Perth was at
</p>
<p>command.
</p>
<p>Dr Harris too, the court physician and surgeon was one
</p>
<p>of the party. Being lame, little assistance was to be ex-
</p>
<p>pected from his sword. But in case any of the royalists
</p>

</p>
<p>had been wounded, his tournequests, forceps, and needles,
</p>
<p>behoved to be of inestimable value.
</p>
<p>Fourthly, The attendants took care likewise to be arm-
</p>
<p>ed. We find those who had been > hunting all morning,
</p>
<p>without arms, stop, notwithstanctmg of their haste to. ac-
</p>
<p>company the king, till their swords were brought. James,
</p>
<p>indeed, takes occasion to let us know, as it were by the by,
</p>
<p>that he himself had nothing except his hunting horn about
</p>
<p>him. But that was of no consequence. All the world knew
</p>
<p>157
</p>
<p>him to be a coward, consequently the want of offensive arms
</p>
<p>on his part, could be no loss to his friends: but so general-
</p>
<p>ly armed were they, that Rynd was questioned if he saw any
</p>
<p>other arms than swords in the king's company, as if their
</p>
<p>purpose could not be effected without a regiment of mus-
</p>
<p>keteers or a park of artillery. However, we cannot help
</p>
<p>observing, that from the question being put to Rynd, we
</p>
<p>suspect that there was a report at that time, of some other
</p>
<p>species of armour besides swords, being in the company.
</p>
<p>Fifthly, It is evident, that the conspirators took care not
</p>
<p>to leave Falkland, or travel all in a body. As an instance
</p>
<p>of this, the abbot of Inchaffray tells us of a bare-laced trick
</p>
<p>played by him, that he might join the party unobserved,
</p>
<p>and as it were by chance. He says that he left Falkland in
</p>
<p>the morning, to go M the highway to Inchaffray ;" yet at
</p>
<p>half past eleven o'clock, he was standing on the road to
</p>
<p>Perth, at less than four miles from Falkland, and when the
</p>
<p>king and his friends came up to the abbot, he mounted horse,
</p>
<p>and joined them : but instead of going " the highway to
</p>
<p>Inchaffray," he "accompanied His Majesty to Perth," where,
</p>
<p>though he does not say that he had any business, or knew
</p>
<p>any thing of the man and gold, and though he saw the bus-
</p>
<p>tle into which Gowry's family was put, in providing dinner,
</p>
<p>instead of giving it relief, by taking himself away, he stops,
</p>
<p>dines, assists at murdering his host, and then, instead of
</p>
<p>going to Inchaffray, returns to Falkland. This is the more
</p>
<p>remarkable, that Alexander refused to breakfast with him
</p>
<p>in the morning, of course he was under no obligation to in-
</p>
<p>vite himself to dinner with the Earl. In fact there is little
</p>
<p>ground for doubting, that his falling in with, and accom-
</p>
<p>panying the king to Perth, was a preconcerted scheme. Inch-
</p>
<p>affray tells us too, that there were only five with the king,
</p>
<p>when they came up to him : some indeed, who had been
</p>
<p>hunting, stopped at Falkland, and changed horses, and got

</p>
<p>swords. But it was not that which detained them, for Len-
</p>
<p>nox waited till he got a sword, and a fresh horse, yet he
</p>
<p>was one of those who composed this first division, led on
</p>
<p>by James himself. The simple truth evidently is this, they
</p>
<p>wished not to appear in a body together.
</p>
<p>Sixthly, The precaution taken by the conspirators to
</p>
<p>separate the two brothers, before massacring them, is fur-
</p>
<p>ther evidence of the design. As they, especially the Earl*
</p>
<p>158
</p>
<p>were known to be men of considerable personal prowess,"
</p>
<p>this stratagem seems to have been nothing but what was
</p>
<p>dictated by prudence; for had they been attacked when to-
</p>
<p>gether, there was a possibility of their defending themselves,
</p>
<p>till the townsmen were alarmed, which might have been
</p>
<p>done in a few minutes, by calling from a window. The
</p>
<p>pretence under which James says, Alexander induced him
</p>
<p>to send the Earl out of the apartment where he had dined,
</p>
<p>is too shallow to have duped even a child. It was to drink
</p>
<p>the health of the king's attendants, who were at dinner in
</p>
<p>the hall ; and as he went out to do so, His Majesty went out
</p>
<p>likewise. This could only detain Gowry a very short time,
</p>
<p>and it is highly improbable, that he would remain long with
</p>
<p>the king's followers, while the king himself was in the house.
</p>
<p>When he returned then, into the place, where he had left
</p>
<p>His Majesty, only a few minutes before, and found him gone,
</p>
<p>what would be the consequence ? Could any step have been
</p>
<p>more likely to occasion a stir in the company, than the sur-
</p>
<p>prise arising from such elopement?
</p>
<p>If it be answered, that there could have been no sur-
</p>
<p>prise, nor consequent agitation, as His Majesty passed a-
</p>
<p>way through the hall, in sight of Gowry, where he was em-
</p>
<p>ployed in " entertayning" the company, it must be grant-
</p>
<p>ed, that this is true. But, that being the case, where, was
</p>
<p>the utility of sending out the Earl at all? If he was to wit-
</p>
<p>ness James and Alexander retiring by themselves, might
</p>
<p>he not have done it in the " chamber" as well as in the
</p>
<p>"halle"?
</p>
<p>But further, On the supposition of the two brothers hav-
</p>
<p>ing a design on the king's life, what must have been their
</p>
<p>drift, on thus separating at the very crisis when their u-
</p>
<p>nited efforts were most wanted?
</p>
<p>The only answer to this question, at all plausible, is,
</p>
<p>that it was designed that the Earl should divert the atten-

</p>
<p>tion of the attendants, while Alexander was perpetrating
</p>
<p>the murder. But the futility of this must strike every one,
</p>
<p>who reflects, that the king's party was in possession of the
</p>
<p>house : they saw His Majesty, in Alexander's company,
</p>
<p>pass to another apartment ; of course, it was a duty, which
</p>
<p>they would certainly fulfil, to insist on having his person
</p>
<p>produced in safety.
</p>
<p>But all these difficulties are removed an once, by only
</p>
<p>admitting what evidently was the simple fact, viz. that it
</p>
<p>159
</p>
<p>was part of the plot, first to take off one, then another of
</p>
<p>the brothers ; and that, for this purpose, James led Alex-
</p>
<p>ander away from Gowry, and the greater part of the king's
</p>
<p>followers : a circumstance, which, as it took place before
</p>
<p>servants, could not be concealed, and therefore this story
</p>
<p>of Alexander desiring the king to send away Gowry, was
</p>
<p>given out, to cover it.
</p>
<p>Seventhly, Another strong presumption, that there was
</p>
<p>a regular preconcerted plot to murder the two brothers, is
</p>
<p>afforded by the deposition of Thomas Erskin, who con-
</p>
<p>fesses, that so soon as he heard His Majesty " cry furth
</p>
<p>of the window" for help, he (Erskin) and his brother " grip-
</p>
<p>ed" Gowry " by the neck, and said to him, traitor, this is
</p>
<p>thy deed ;" the certain prelude to his death, we may be
</p>
<p>sure, had not his servants interposed. Discomfited in this
</p>
<p>quarter, the Erskins joined Ramsay, and assisted him in
</p>
<p>destroying his antagonist, or rather victim.
</p>
<p>The villany here is so obvious, that it must be super-
</p>
<p>fluous to enlarge on the matter ; suffice it to ask, If there
</p>
<p>is any probability of such persons as the Erskins were " clasp-
</p>
<p>ing the Earl of Gowry by the garter, casting him under
</p>
<p>their feet, and wanting" L e. wishing for " a dagger to have
</p>
<p>strucken him with" merely because two men were fighting
</p>
<p>in his house ?
</p>
<p>Eighthly, It is an observation which has frequently been
</p>
<p>made, that presumptive evidence is often more satisfactory,
</p>
<p>than that which is positive or direct. This must especially
</p>
<p>be the case, where a number of circumstances, each of which,
</p>
<p>is in some measure insulated from the others, concur in es-
</p>
<p>tablishing the same fact. Such is more convincing than
</p>
<p>evidence arising from the declaration of witnesses, because
</p>
<p>they may be in a mistake, they may be prejudiced, or they
</p>
<p>may be interested.
</p>
<p>But if a case shall occur, where these two species of e-

</p>
<p>vidence are conjoined ; where a considerable body of cir-
</p>
<p>cumstantial proof supports the direct testimony of witness-
</p>
<p>es, without a single circumstance of a countervailing na-
</p>
<p>ture, sceptical indeed must he be who doubts the fact.
</p>
<p>And further, if these circumstances are pointed and nume-
</p>
<p>rous ; and if the declaration of the witnesses is direct ; and
</p>
<p>they themselves interested in concealing what they disco-
</p>
<p>ver ; the evidence then ranks in the highest degree of hu-
</p>
<p>man probability.
</p>
<p>160
</p>
<p>This is precisely the case in the Gowry Conspiracy/
</p>
<p>We have seen that such a number of circumstances have comer
</p>
<p>to light, as must satisfy every reasonable unbiassed man,
</p>
<p>that king James and his followers murdered the two bro-
</p>
<p>thers ; and we are now to hear this corroborated by the di-
</p>
<p>rect, unequivocal, and unqualified testimony of James him-
</p>
<p>self and a number of his accessaries. To those who have
</p>
<p>been accustomed to hear of the Gowry Conspiracy as a mys-
</p>
<p>terious transaction which never has been, and very probably
</p>
<p>never will be understood, we are aware that this will appear
</p>
<p>a rash assertion. But the matter is too explicit to leave
</p>
<p>ground for altercation.
</p>
<p>In the " discourse," or narrative Of that affair, written,
</p>
<p>it is said, by James, and published by authority, we are
</p>
<p>told, that upon his coming to close quarters with Alexan-
</p>
<p>der Ruthven in the study, he was the stronger man, for
</p>
<p>" His Majesty per force drove him" Alexander " to the
</p>
<p>window." Next " His Majesty  brought him per force
</p>
<p>out of that study." Lastly, we are told that " His Majesty
</p>
<p>having gotten the said Alexander's head under his arm*
</p>
<p>and himself on his knee, His Majesty drove him back per
</p>
<p>force hard to the door of the said turnpike." Thus James
</p>
<p>tells us, that in the struggle, he was able first to drag Alex-
</p>
<p>ander to the window of the study, then out of the studyj
</p>
<p>and lastly, to push him back to the door at the top of the
</p>
<p>stairs.
</p>
<p>Ramsay again depones, that when he entered the cham-
</p>
<p>ber, H he sees His Majesty and Mr Alexander Ruthven in
</p>
<p>others arms, striving and wrestling together, His Majesty
</p>
<p>having Alexander's head under his arm, and Mr Alexan-
</p>
<p>der being almost on his knees."
</p>
<p>Alexander, thus completely mastered, had it not in his
</p>
<p>power to hurt either king or courtier. He was under the
</p>
<p>king, on his knees ; Henderson, who had declared his reso-

</p>
<p>lution to befriend the king, was standing by with a drawn
</p>
<p>dagger in his hand; Ramsay had entered the apartment
</p>
<p>with his sword drawn ; Mr Alexander's sword was still in
</p>
<p>its sheath. Under these circumstances, what had they to
</p>
<p>apprehend from him : They ran no risk by preserving him
</p>
<p>alive. He could neither hurt them, nor escape. Nor is that
</p>
<p>all. According to the king's declaration, and Henderson's
</p>
<p>deposition, Alexander, only a few minutes before, had told
</p>
<p>them that he was not a principal in the plot, but that he had
</p>
<p>16i
</p>
<p>his instructions from his brother the Earl. If he told this,
</p>
<p>why kill him ? Why not reserve him alive for a public tri-
</p>
<p>al, and by means of his evidence, discover the extent of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, so that the principal traitors might be brought
</p>
<p>to justice ? Calderwood tells us, that when Mr Robert
</p>
<p>Bruce, some months afterwards, pressed the king for the
</p>
<p>reason of his putting Mr Ruthven to death, when he might
</p>
<p>have saved him, James at first alleged that it was done in
</p>
<p>his own defence. Bruce asked, " Why brought yee him
</p>
<p>not to justice, seeing yee should have had God before your
</p>
<p>eyes ?" " I had neither God nor the Devil, man, before my
</p>
<p>eyes," said His Majesty, " but my own defence." But re-
</p>
<p>collecting, no doubt, that this was in direct contradiction
</p>
<p>to his former declaration, he instantly got into ill humour
</p>
<p>with the impertinent parson, swearing that he " was once
</p>
<p>minded to have spared Mr Alexander, but the motion of
</p>
<p>killing him prevailed."
</p>
<p>Thus, if we are to credit the testimony of the three indi-
</p>
<p>viduals who survived, (and we have no other,) self defence
</p>
<p>was altogether out of the question. Indeed it is clear to a de-
</p>
<p>monstration, even taking the murderer's account of the mat-
</p>
<p>ter, that Alexander's death was resolved on before this ;
</p>
<p>and that all those who had an immediate hand in it were in
</p>
<p>the secret. Henderson says that the instant Ramsay enter-
</p>
<p>ed the chamber, without enquiring into the nature of the
</p>
<p>fray, he stabbed Mr Ruthven, although he saw that he had
</p>
<p>the worst of it, being down on his knees in the struggle.
</p>
<p>James, again, does not desire Ramsay to assist him in se-
</p>
<p>curing Mr Alexander. So far from that, that he gives in-
</p>
<p>structions how to dispatch him quickly, by cutting his throat,
</p>
<p>or neck, as his trunk was secured by defensive armour.*
</p>
<p>" Strike him high," said His Majesty, " for he has an payne
</p>
<p>doublet on." Accordingly Ramsay gave him several wounds,
</p>
<p>and in that state he was pushed over, or " down the stairs."

</p>
<p>But still further, Thomas Erskine, Dr Herries, and Wil-
</p>
<p>son the servant, were only " five steps" from the bottom of
</p>
<p>the stairs, when Mr Alexander, in this deplorable state,
</p>
<p>wounded and bleeding, fell in with them. They were ig-
</p>
<p>norant of the nature of the fracas which had taken place in
</p>
<p>the upper part of the house. They had no opportunity of
</p>
<p>knowing that Mr Ruthven was so much as engaged in it.
</p>
<p>X.
</p>
<p>* Which, however, seems not to have been the case, as we hear no
</p>
<p>more of it,
</p>
<p>162
</p>
<p>Ramsay, indeed, had called from the window, for Erskin
</p>
<p>to come up to the head of the turnpike, but he did not ac-
</p>
<p>quaint him with the reason of this request, far less did he
</p>
<p>direct him to murder every one he should meet with in his
</p>
<p>way. They had no other communication with James, or
</p>
<p>those above. Alexander gave them no provocation. He
</p>
<p>did not so much as speak to them. His sword was in its
</p>
<p>sheath ; of course, they could not even suspect, that he had
</p>
<p>.been the aggressor, in any squabble. Nay, for ought that
</p>
<p>they could learn at this time, he might have been on the
</p>
<p>King's side, if they knew that the King was engaged in the
</p>
<p>affair. At any rate, if innocent, he was an object of pity ;
</p>
<p>if guilty, they could easily have secured the half dead body.
</p>
<p>But instead of that, the moment these bloodhounds set eyes
</p>
<p>on him, without asking him a single question, without wait-
</p>
<p>ing to hear him speak, and without any deliberation, they
</p>
<p>encourage one another to murder him, dart on him, wound-
</p>
<p>ed and unarmed as he was, and quickly " ended him."
</p>
<p>Thus we see that none of them, the King, Ramsay,
</p>
<p>Erskin, Harris, nor Wilson, hesitated a moment, how they
</p>
<p>were to act. They all agreed in taking his life, the moment
</p>
<p>he was within reach of them, and this without any manner
</p>
<p>of consultation among themselves. So that it is evident
</p>
<p>to a demonstration that their resolution was formed before.
</p>
<p>Nearly similar were the circumstances attending the
</p>
<p>Earl's death. After an attempt was made on his life in the
</p>
<p>court, hearing an unusual uproar in the house, Gowry
</p>
<p>thought it prudent not to go in, and investigate the affair,
</p>
<p>unarmed, he therefore borrowed his Steward's helmet, and
</p>
<p>having two swords, went up stairs, accompanied by one ser-
</p>
<p>vant only. Being thus on his guard, the assassins saw that
</p>
<p>it would be a serious matter to take his life, as he seemed
</p>
<p>determined not to fall unrevenged ; they therefore had re-
</p>
<p>course to cunning for effecting their design. It was thus.

</p>
<p>King James VI. all his life had an uncommon predilection
</p>
<p>for sleeping in a whole skin. To ensure which at this time,
</p>
<p>he slipped, or (to take his own word for it) his servants shut
</p>
<p>him back into the closet, till the affair with Gowry should
</p>
<p>be terminated. James's friends seeing the Earl stand on
</p>
<p>the defensive, one of them with the design of putting him
</p>
<p>off his guard said, " You have occasioned the king's death,
</p>
<p>will you also murder us ?" The report of the king being
</p>
<p>dead so astonished the Earl, that he dropped the points of
</p>
<p>163
</p>
<p>his swords on the floor. This was precisely what was want-
</p>
<p>ed. The opportunity was not to be neglected. The ruffian
</p>
<p>Ramsay, came behind, and stabbed him through the heart.
</p>
<p>In this, no less than in the case of Alexander, we obvi-
</p>
<p>ously see deliberate, preconcerted murder. When the Earl
</p>
<p>suffered Ramsay to come behind him, with the naked bloody
</p>
<p>dagger in his hand, he must have had his attention engross-
</p>
<p>ed by some others of the party : for, after they had taken a-
</p>
<p>way his brother's life, Gowry certainly never Would willingly
</p>
<p>put his own in their power. This being the case, Ramsay,
</p>
<p>when he came behind, and stabbed him, might with equal
</p>
<p>facility, have seized and pinioned him. In that he would
</p>
<p>have been assisted by two or three of his accomplices; whilst
</p>
<p>one or two of the others would have parried off Cranston.
</p>
<p>The securing the two brothers at this time, and bringing
</p>
<p>them to trial alive, would have afforded some sort of satis-
</p>
<p>faction to the world. Indeed, the king was called upon by
</p>
<p>every earthly consideration to do this. It was a duty which
</p>
<p>he owed to himself, to his dependants, but especially to the
</p>
<p>house of Ruthven, as the lives and reputation of all these,
</p>
<p>were so much implicated in the charge. And there can be
</p>
<p>no doubt, that had he wished to have the matter fairly and
</p>
<p>openly investigated, he would have preferred this method,
</p>
<p>to that of first taking away the lives of the two noblemen,
</p>
<p>hanging, torturing, and banishing such of their adherents
</p>
<p>as shewed any disposition to manifest their innocence, and
</p>
<p>then bestowing bounties upon perjury and murder in their
</p>
<p>enemies.
</p>
<p>But this, though enough, is not all. The Earl's mur-
</p>
<p>derers give no reason why they put him to death. Even by
</p>
<p>their own account, they did not know, at this time, that he
</p>
<p>had any design upon either the life or liberty of the king.
</p>
<p>An attempt had been made upon his own person, in the
</p>
<p>very court of his own house. He overheard an unaccount-

</p>
<p>able disturbance within doors, and to learn the occasion of
</p>
<p>that, he arms himself, and goes in. At the bottom of the
</p>
<p>stairs he sees the dead body of his brother, evidently mur-
</p>
<p>dered; as his sword was still undrawn. Aware that, under
</p>
<p>such circumstances, the squabble could be of no trivial na-
</p>
<p>ture, he ascends the stair attended by a servant. But so
</p>
<p>unconscious was he of having done any thing deserving
</p>
<p>death, that on his entering the apartment, he lavs himself
</p>
<p>X2
</p>
<p>164
</p>
<p>open to an attack, whilst the king's servants proceeded ttf
</p>
<p>give an account of the matter.
</p>
<p>Now in all this, so far are we from perceiving any thing
</p>
<p>treasonable, or in the least culpable, that we see no part of
</p>
<p>his conduct, but such as was the duty of every good sub-
</p>
<p>ject. Such considerations, as his being principal in the plot;
</p>
<p>sending his brother and servants to Falkland to decoy the
</p>
<p>king to Perth; his ordering Henderson to arm, take his
</p>
<p>station in the closet, and obey Alexander's directions; and
</p>
<p>the whole et ccBtera of the storjr, even supposing them true,
</p>
<p>cannot have even the smallest weight here; as James and
</p>
<p>his followers inform us, that it was not till afterwards, that
</p>
<p>they became acquainted with all these.
</p>
<p>Thus, it is evident from the account of this transaction,
</p>
<p>voluntarily given by James and his band, that their reason
</p>
<p>lor taking the lives of the Earl and his brother, was neither
</p>
<p>as a punishment of their crimes, nor in preservation of their
</p>
<p>own lives ; but preconcerted murder* in the most unlimited
</p>
<p>sense of the term.
</p>
<p>After such an inference, it may perhaps be thought su*
</p>
<p>perfluous, to take notice of any after circumstances con-
</p>
<p>nected with this transaction. Yet the relation of some inci-
</p>
<p>dents, said to have taken place after the murder was perpe-
</p>
<p>trated, cannot be unentcrtaining, though its utility may
</p>
<p>not be very apparent.
</p>
<p>The first we si all mention, is one which exemplifies the
</p>
<p>depravity of James's character in a religious and moral point
</p>
<p>of view. He tells us, in the discourse, that immediately
</p>
<p>after that division of the assassins which beset the principal
</p>
<p>stair, broke into the chamber where the other, that had
</p>
<p>murdered the two noblemen, was, " His Majesty kneeling
</p>
<p>down on his knees, in the midst of his own servants, and
</p>
<p>they all kneeling found about him, His Majesty out of his
</p>
<p>own mouth, thanked God for that miraculous deliverance

</p>
<p>and victory : assuring himself, that God had preserved him
</p>
<p>from so despaired a perill, for the perfecting of some greater
</p>
<p>work behind, to his glory, and for procuring by him the
</p>
<p>wealeof his people, that God had committed to his charge" ! ! !
</p>
<p>Very pious truly and withal very modest. It is not at all
</p>
<p>incredible, that every individual of James's company should
</p>
<p>seriously join in this ejaculation, for it is observable, that the
</p>
<p>court usually assimilates its character to that of the prince;
</p>
<p>and we all have heard, that King James the Sixth was very
</p>
<p>165
</p>
<p>devout, as well as very learned. But if we were to believe
</p>
<p>all that he wished us to believe, on the present occasion, we
</p>
<p>would certainly be of opinion, that his piety outran his pru-
</p>
<p>dence, for undoubtedly, it would have shewn no disrespect
</p>
<p>to the Deity, though James and his people had, in the first
</p>
<p>place, searched the house in quest of Gowry's accomplices,
</p>
<p>great numbers of whom, must, if we credit his story, have
</p>
<p>been secreted in it, and in readiness to complete the scheme,
</p>
<p>whether it was to kill, or confine the king. But we are not
</p>
<p>told that James took any steps for this purpose. An omis-<
</p>
<p>sion, which it is difficult to account for any other way, than by
</p>
<p>placing it to the score of the religious notion, which was pre-
</p>
<p>dominant in him at the time. Most people are contented
</p>
<p>with adhering to one religious persuasion, and many even
</p>
<p>to none at all; but James's belief, we have already seen, ex-
</p>
<p>tended to four or five different systems : and, perhaps, at
</p>
<p>that particular period he was in a Calvinistical fit, and, be-
</p>
<p>lieving in predestination, he considered as useless all pre-
</p>
<p>caution for avoiding danger. But to be serious. In what
</p>
<p>estimation can we hold the wretch, who, having perpetrated
</p>
<p>a crime the most atrocious within the reach of man, in-
</p>
<p>stantly goes, as it were, before his Maker and Judge, and
</p>
<p>declares himself perfectly innocent? If James fabricated
</p>
<p>this anecdote, and gave it to the world without any founda-
</p>
<p>tion in truth, in what light must he have appeared, to his
</p>
<p>attendants and servants ? And if he really did address God
</p>
<p>Almighty in this manner, how contemptible must his cha-
</p>
<p>racter have appeared, to those of his accomplices who were
</p>
<p>in the secret ? But, in either case, what a daring action was
</p>
<p>it, thus to insult an Omniscient God ! Indeed, the best
</p>
<p>apology that can be offered for him is, that he did not believe
</p>
<p>in the existence of that Being : as this is less offensive, than
</p>
<p>to acknowledge a Deity, yet treat him with mockery and
</p>

</p>
<p>But though the " despaired perill," for escaping which,.
</p>
<p>James pretended to be thus grateful, was only fictitious ; a
</p>
<p>real one, and that of no trivial nature, was impending-
</p>
<p>The occasion and nature of which was this.
</p>
<p>Although in general the plot was contrived in only a
</p>
<p>bungling manner, yet in one part, it was managed artfully
</p>
<p>enough. James was aware, that the world was well ac-
</p>
<p>quainted with his duplicity and cruelty. In particular, his
</p>
<p>antipathy to every man of an independent mind, was well
</p>
<p>166
</p>
<p>known. Consequently, he foresaw the difficulty, of imposing
</p>
<p>on the public this atrocious murder, as self-defence. But
</p>
<p>knowing, that much would depend on the nature of the im-
</p>
<p>pression that should be first made on men's minds, he, in
</p>
<p>order that that might be as favourable as possible, contrived
</p>
<p>to secure one of the magistrates of Perth in his interest
</p>
<p>for that purpose. This was baillie Roy. We can learn
</p>
<p>from his declaration, that he was either an arrant villain, or
</p>
<p>a poor hare-brained idiot, very willing to serve a great man,
</p>
<p>in any shape, as far as his capacity enabled him. By his
</p>
<p>own account, he had sauntered] into Earl Gowry's hall to
</p>
<p>see the great folk eat their dinner. A step fully as befitting
</p>
<p>an idle boy, as the principal resident magistrate of such a
</p>
<p>town as Perth. But the truth seems to be, that he was con-
</p>
<p>sidered as the fittest person to acquaint the townsmen with
</p>
<p>the fate of their chief magistrate, and in doing that, to pre-
</p>
<p>possess them with the notion of Gowry's treason ; and an
</p>
<p>idle curiosity was the only reason that could be given, for
</p>
<p>his (Roy's) being in Gowry's house at that time. Accord-
</p>
<p>ingly, upon the perpetration of the murder, he ran through
</p>
<p>the streets, yelling like one distracted, and calling on the
</p>
<p>people to rescue the king; and caused ring the bell. By
</p>
<p>these means, he succeeded in creating an alarm, and as-
</p>
<p>sembling a large body of the inhabitants before Gowry's
</p>
<p>house. But he failed in duping them so far, as to convince
</p>
<p>them that the Earl and his brother were slain in any attempt
</p>
<p>upon the king's person. For, on coming to the place, the
</p>
<p>circumstsnces that occurred soon satisfied them that this
</p>
<p>was only a fresh instance of James's villany* And so strong
</p>
<p>was their resentment, that they besieged him in the house,
</p>
<p>two or three hours; insulting him with the most opprobrious
</p>
<p>language, and threatening him with instant death*. Nor
</p>
<p>was it without the utmost exertions on the part of James
</p>
<p>and his attendants, that the people (several of whom were

</p>
<p>persons of distinction) were prevented from putting their
</p>
<p>threats into execution. Some of the courtiers were employ-
</p>
<p>ed in defending the gate ; whilst others, such as Lennox,
</p>
<p>and some of the Murrays, endeavoured to sooth the popu-
</p>
<p>lace by fair words. The surviving magistrates too, were
</p>
<p>called on to use their influence in prevailing on the people
</p>
<p>* " Gi'e us out our Provost, or the king's green coat shall pay for it," said
</p>
<p>one. " Come down thou son of Signor Davie, you have slain an .honester
</p>
<p>man than yourself," said another.
</p>
<p>167
</p>
<p>to desist, and when that course was found to be ineffectual,
</p>
<p>the baillies were directed to command them by proclamation
</p>
<p>in His Majesty's name to retire, under the pain of treason.
</p>
<p>Although the people had no high opinion of James's vera-
</p>
<p>city, in ordinary cases, they knew his character too well,
</p>
<p>to suppose that he would not keep his word on the present
</p>
<p>occasion. They therefore dispersed. In short, this story
</p>
<p>of bail] ie Roy's is the most foolish of the whole. Had he des-
</p>
<p>cried a hostile army at some distance, advancing against the
</p>
<p>town, he might very properly have gone or sent through
</p>
<p>the streets, and rung the alarm bell, to raise the inhabitants,
</p>
<p>because there was time for doing so ; but can any person be-
</p>
<p>lieve, that, when the danger was so imminent as it must
</p>
<p>have been, when the king cryed treason ! murder ! help !
</p>
<p>any one who was at hand, and wished to give him assist-
</p>
<p>ance, would run away, bellowing like one demented, through
</p>
<p>the streets for help ? Would he not have hastened without
</p>
<p>losing a second of time to the place where the danger was,
</p>
<p>and where assistance must have been given instantly, or it
</p>
<p>would have come too late ?
</p>
<p>Secondly, James informs us, that before leaving Perth,
</p>
<p>he caused search the Earl's pockets for any letters or papers,
</p>
<p>that he might have upon him, which might be of use to
</p>
<p>throw light on the mystery ; and that they found nothing
</p>
<p>of that kind. They however found that he was a necro-
</p>
<p>mancer, magician, or wizard, as Sir Thomas Erskin ab-
</p>
<p>stracted, (Cromarty says from his girdle, James says from
</p>
<p>his pockets*) " certain magical characters." It would be
</p>
<p>presumption to enter into any controversy with James, re-
</p>
<p>lating to the reality and nature of witchcraft, as he was so
</p>
<p>for master of the subject, that he wrote a book on it. A
</p>
<p>very learned tract, no doubt. But as we are more scepti-
</p>
<p>cal, or less knowing, we shall, on this occasion, encounter
</p>
<p>him on other ground.

</p>
<p>And in the first place, even granting all that he has ad-
</p>
<p>vanced on this head, either by assertions or inuendos, to be
</p>
<p>true, what does it avail his cause ? He owns, that it was
</p>
<p>not till after they had slain both the brothers, that they
</p>
<p>made this discovery, consequently it cannot, in the least,
</p>
<p>justify them for slaying them.
</p>
<p>Secondly, These characters might be something else
</p>
<p>* These may easily be made to agree. Perhaps his pockets were in his
</p>
<p>girdle or attached to it.
</p>
<p>16$
</p>
<p>than, words of enchantment," as we learn from Cromarty,-
</p>
<p>that they were unintelligible to all who did not " exercise
</p>
<p>that art," L e. necromancy. James and his party, we may
</p>
<p>well suppose, made the most of the matter that possibly
</p>
<p>could be made. Accordingly Nicolson, Elizabeth's resident
</p>
<p>in Scotland, who doubtless would get his information at
</p>
<p>court, writes to Cecil, a few days after this, " Upon the
</p>
<p>Earl, they say, were found characters, some for love, blood,
</p>
<p>&c. and one against the power of the Divine Majestic" On
</p>
<p>the other hand, the author of the book entitled, " The con-
</p>
<p>spiracy of the Ruthvens," published next year, informs us
</p>
<p>that to attract good, and repulse bad spirits, was one quali-
</p>
<p>ty in Gowry's charms. James, again, very gravely assures
</p>
<p>us that their efficacy appeared in another shape, for " while
</p>
<p>they were upon him (Go wry), his wound, whereof he died,
</p>
<p>bled not; but incontinent, after taking them away, the
</p>
<p>blood gushed out in great abundance, to the admiration of
</p>
<p>all the beholders*."
</p>
<p>The characters seem to have assumed different shapes at
</p>
<p>different periods. By Rynd's account, they were partly in
</p>
<p>Greek, partly in Latin, when he first saw them at Padua :
</p>
<p>yet Cromarty says, none but dabblers in the black art could
</p>
<p>understand them. Again, James says, they found only " a
</p>
<p>little close parchment bag full of magical characters, and
</p>
<p>words of inchantment" written, it would appear on separate
</p>
<p>bits or slips of paper. But by the time of the first Earl of
</p>
<p>Cromarty, who says he had them several years in his cus-
</p>
<p>tody, they had assumed a very different form. They then
</p>
<p>appeared in the likeness " of sheets of paper, stitched in the
</p>
<p>form of a book, near five inches long, and three broad, full
</p>
<p>of magical spells and characters."
</p>
<p>This Proteus-like quality of the characters, however,
</p>
<p>is no proof of their not being " magical spells." So far
</p>
<p>from it, that that is generally recognised as a characteristic

</p>
<p>of necromantic agents and instruments ; and it evinces a
</p>
<p>singular kind of sagacity in my Lord, which at length rais-
</p>
<p>* In order to save James's character from the ridicule naturally attached
</p>
<p>to such a story, his friends endeavour to account for this admirable bleeding,
</p>
<p>en natural principles. Perhaps, say they, it was occasioned by altering the
</p>
<p>posture of the body, when searching his pockets. But this is far from satis-
</p>
<p>factory. Gowry was killed between three and four o'clock. It was eight
</p>
<p>"before James left Perth. It was only a short time before his departure that
</p>
<p>he caused search the Earl's body ; and we know, that after a human body
</p>
<p>has been dead three or four hours, blood will not gush from it " in great a-
</p>
<p>bu'.idance."
</p>
<p>169
</p>
<p>ed him to great rank and opulence, that he knew these were
</p>
<p>magical characters, when he owns that he did not under-
</p>
<p>stand them.
</p>
<p>In the last place, we may observe, that there is not even
</p>
<p>the slightest legal evidence that any such characters were
</p>
<p>usually carried about Gowry's body, in his lifetime, or
</p>
<p>found on it after his death.
</p>
<p>At a precognition taken, August 20th, in Falkland,
</p>
<p>Rynd, indeed, is made to say, that he frequently saw these
</p>
<p>identical characters in My lord's possession, when they
</p>
<p>were in Italy. But we have already seen that whatever Rynd
</p>
<p>deponed, was extorted from him by torture. There is, be-
</p>
<p>sides, great probability that the whole of the account, said to
</p>
<p>be his deposition, is a forgery. We learn that James made no
</p>
<p>scruple to erase from the public records, whatever he con-
</p>
<p>sidered as derogatory to his own, or his family's reputation,
</p>
<p>and that he held out bribes to the historians of that period,
</p>
<p>who were willing to prostitute their works for that purpose*.
</p>
<p>It surely then will not be considered as an unfair infe-
</p>
<p>rence to suppose, that when he, or his creatures, had the
</p>
<p>uncontrolled fabrication of these records in their own hands,
</p>
<p>they would be careful to compose them of such materials,
</p>
<p>and after such a fashion, as suited their own views ; and never
</p>
<p>could a more convenient occasion, than the present, occur
</p>
<p>for doing so. On the one side was all the power and influ-
</p>
<p>ence of the kingdom; on the other, the parties were alrea-
</p>
<p>dy put to death, no advocate appeared for them, and their
</p>
<p>witnesses were either writhing under the torture, or deter-
</p>
<p>red by the fear of death from declaring the truth. But on
</p>
<p>this point we are not left to mere conjecture ; Nicolson, in
</p>
<p>a letter to Cecil, dated the very day after the precognition,
</p>
<p>writesf, " Master William Rynd the Pedagogue hath been
</p>
<p>extremely booted, but eonfesseth nothing of that matter a-
</p>
<p>gainst the Earl or his brother." Now, in opposition to

</p>
<p>the account published by the court, we here have the unso-
</p>
<p>licited testimony of a man, whose interest led him rather to
</p>
<p>flatter James. The world will decide to which credit is due.
</p>
<p>But further, no person is brought forward who witness-
</p>
<p>ed the abstraction of these characters from Gowry's body.
</p>
<p>James, in his " discourse," only tells us, that they were
</p>
<p>found in his pockets; but does not say where they then
</p>
<p>^erej ; nor what measures were taken, at that time, to iden-

<p>* Laing's History of Scotland, Vols. 1st and 2d, passim. f The origi-

<p>nal still exist* in the paper office, J At the time of his writing,
</p>
<p>170
</p>
<p>tify them, so that they might be certainly recognised after-
</p>
<p>wards. They were not entrusted to the keeping of the ma-
</p>
<p>gistrates of Perth, along with the three servants, and the
</p>
<p>two dead bodies of the Ruthvens, till the trial. Instead of
</p>
<p>that, Cromarty tells us, that they were delivered by Sir
</p>
<p>Thomas Erskine, who took them from Gowry's body, to
</p>
<p>his brother Sir George Erskine of Invertiel, who must have
</p>
<p>handed them about court, as we find Galloway had them
</p>
<p>in possession some few days afterwards, but Sir George seems
</p>
<p>to have again got them in keeping, for Cromarty adds,
</p>
<p>" These papers I found in Sir George Erskine of Invertile's
</p>
<p>Cabinet wrapt in paper, whereon was writ with Sir George's
</p>
<p>own hand, * These are the papers which Sir Thomas Ers-
</p>
<p>kine, my brother, did take out of the Earl of Gowry's gir-
</p>
<p>dle, after he was killed at Perth, and which papers were then
</p>
<p>delivered by my brother Sir Thomas to me to keep." This
</p>
<p>is the account which Cromarty gives of their coming into
</p>
<p>his custody; but how long they remained there, is not known.
</p>
<p>For when in 1713 he had sent the M. S. of his Conspiracies
</p>
<p>of the family of pQwry to the press, it occurred to him that
</p>
<p>a copy, or Fac Simile of these characters might be of use to
</p>
<p>some, and a matter of curiosity to others, he therefore stop-
</p>
<p>ped the press for some time, till he should endeavour to find,
</p>
<p>and transmit them to the printer ; but strange to tell, though
</p>
<p>about 120 years old, 1 13 of which they luid lien in a torpid
</p>
<p>ntatc, they had not lost their virtue, for when the Earl went
</p>
<p>in search of them, they had evanished, and have not been
</p>
<p>heard of since*.
</p>
<p>Perhaps some apology may be thought necessary for
</p>
<p>having dwelt so long on a subject so ridiculous as that of
</p>
<p>witchcraft now is. But it will be observed, that no serious
</p>
<p>defence is offered against the reality of the charge. It is
</p>
<p>only the unfair methods which were adopted in endeavour-
</p>
<p>ing to substantiate it, to which we have adverted. And we

<p>shall take leave of this head, after having stated that witch-
</p>
<p>craft and sorcery was, or were, the Hobby-horse of James
</p>
<p>VI. and even of the age in which he lived. All those whose
</p>
<p>abilities or attainments exceeded, in any great degree, the
</p>
<p>* Possibly the assertion that these characters had lien all this time in a tor-
</p>
<p>pid state is not quite correct. They may have been of service to Cromarty.
</p>
<p>This we are assured of, that with very slender natural abilities, and only a
</p>
<p>small portion of erudition, he attained great honours and the highest offices ir*
</p>
<p>the btate. And after passing his grand climacteric, he prevailed on a noble
</p>
<p>woman, rich, beautiful, and healthy, and under twenty years pf age, ti
</p>
<p>give him her hand in marriage.
</p>
<p>171
</p>
<p>Ordinary standard, were seriously considered as necroman-
</p>
<p>cers by the commonalty. Those, again, who had hones-
</p>
<p>ty and courage enough to withstand the gross corruptions
</p>
<p>which then prevailed in the church, were sure to be tra-
</p>
<p>duced by the knavish priesthood, as emissaries of Satan.
</p>
<p>Gowry, then, who united both these qualities in his charac-
</p>
<p>ter, could not fail to be stigmatised as an adept in witchcraft ;
</p>
<p>and a more effectual method of extinguishing his popularity
</p>
<p>could not have been devised, than that of convicting him of
</p>
<p>witchcraft. . Every body believed in the existence of witches,
</p>
<p>and every body held them in abhorrence. Had the people
</p>
<p>been fully convinced that Gowry was a sorcerer, they would
</p>
<p>have considered him as more deserving of death, than though
</p>
<p>lie had cut the king's throat.
</p>
<p>Thirdly, The opinion which was generally entertained,
</p>
<p>at the time, concerning the reality of Gowry's conspiracy,
</p>
<p>together with the uncommon eagerness of James and his
</p>
<p>friends to impress on the mind of the world ah opinion of
</p>
<p>its reality, are no contemptible arguments in support of this
</p>
<p>system. We see that the people of Perth did not mince
</p>
<p>the matter ; they openly declared their sentiments, and that
</p>
<p>in no very courtly stile. , And such lengths did they go,
</p>
<p>tliat the Magistrates and Town Council, as representing the
</p>
<p>community, were summoned to appear before the king at
</p>
<p>Linlithgow, on the sixteenth of September, and answer for
</p>
<p>the contempt and indignity done His Majesty. Among o-
</p>
<p>thcr particulars are enumerated, " Certain irreverent and
</p>
<p>iindutiful speeches against His Majesty."
</p>
<p>The anxiety, too, which he evinced to have the clergy
</p>
<p>preach up the reality of a treasonable attempt, on the
</p>
<p>part of the two brothers against him, and the eagerness with
</p>
<p>which he persecuted the recusants, is no less observable.
</p>
<p>He was sensible that the guilt of the action was very glar-
</p>
<p>ing, and therefore endeavoured to be before hand with peo-

</p>
<p>ple's suspicion every where. He was likewise sensible, that
</p>
<p>a very powerful method of gaining partizans in a bffld causes
</p>
<p>is to make people commit themselves, before they are ac-
</p>
<p>quainted with the extent of its depravity. It was for this rea-
</p>
<p>son that, when he sent his account of the affair to the coun-
</p>
<p>cil, an order accompanied it for the ministers of the city
</p>
<p>of Edinburgh to convene their people on the morrow, and
</p>
<p>make an extraordinary profession of thanjdulness to the A)-
</p>
<p>Y2
</p>
<p>m
</p>
<p>mighty for his deliverance, for he well knew that 
</p>
<p>Quoti'cs vis fallere Plebem
</p>
<p>Finge Deum
</p>
<p>That this was his motive, appears from the vehemence with
</p>
<p>which he pressed an instant compliance, and the resentment
</p>
<p>which he shewed against those who wished to delay, for on-
</p>
<p>ly a day or two, merely for the purpose of gaining more sa-
</p>
<p>tisfactory information concerning the matter. Nay, they
</p>
<p>were not so much as allowed to consult among themselves,
</p>
<p>what steps should be taken. It is indeed fashionable, now-
</p>
<p>a-days, to allege, that no stress ought to be laid upon the
</p>
<p>opinion of these men, as they were a set of seditious fana-
</p>
<p>tics, aspiring at supremacy in both church and state. It
</p>
<p>would rather be foreign to our present purpose, to enter in-
</p>
<p>to a defence of the conduct of the leaders among the Pres-
</p>
<p>byterian clergy, in the end of the sixteenth century. It
</p>
<p>certainly was not irreproachable. But if we consider the
</p>
<p>period of time, and the circumstances in which they lived,
</p>
<p>we must be satisfied that many of these traits in their cha-
</p>
<p>racters, which we ridicule as foibles, and execrate as faults,
</p>
<p>were necessary for combating their opponents* and accom-
</p>
<p>plishing the great design which they had in view. It is by
</p>
<p>no means fair to charge them with fanaticism, sedition, in-
</p>
<p>humanity, and indifference to the arts and sciences, &c.
</p>
<p>without at the same time stating the superstition, immora-
</p>
<p>lity, and tyranny, which sell' preservation required them to
</p>
<p>resist ; nor with rudeness and ferocity of manners, without
</p>
<p>considering, whether, had they been what we of the pre-
</p>
<p>sent day term moderate and courteous* they could have freed
</p>
<p>the nation from the absurdities of the oppressions both civil
</p>
<p>and ecclesiastical, under which it then groaned. And if
</p>
<p>the Reformation clergy were either fanatics, or enthusiasts,
</p>
<p>they, at least, must have credit for the sincerity of their pro-
</p>
<p>fessions. In the present instance, especially, the Edinburgh

<p>ministers evidently were actuated by a conscientious regard
</p>
<p>to their duty. Before the king's account of the matter was
</p>
<p>imparted to them, they were informed through another
</p>
<p>channel, that it was a fabrication of falsehoods, and that the
</p>
<p>real state of the matter was, that a number of ruffians had
</p>
<p>murdered the two brothers. What then could the ministers
</p>
<p>do? Were they to insult heaven, and debase their own
</p>
<p>characters to please any man ? They had no alternative,
</p>
<p>but to do this, or delav the observance of a solemn thanks-
</p>
<p>173
</p>
<p>giving. Those who disobeyed, did it at the expense of their
</p>
<p>stipends, and situations in life. There can be little doubt
</p>
<p>that it was with the design of hood-winking the public, that
</p>
<p>Bishop Lindsay was sent over to act the farce of calling the
</p>
<p>people together, addressing them in the market place, and
</p>
<p>pretending to thank God for the signal preservation of the

<p>king from the two traitors. The case was urgent : a single
</p>
<p>day's delay would have afforded time for the real state of the
</p>
<p>affair to spread abroad, and for the people to reflect on the
</p>
<p>incongruity of the several circumstances set forth in the roy-
</p>
<p>al account, which, we may suppose, was not so well digest-
</p>
<p>ed at first, as when given to the public four weeks after-
</p>
<p>wards, even incoherent as it still is.
</p>
<p>So very keen was James to have his story universally
</p>
<p>credited, that when he went over from Fife on Monday,
</p>
<p>notwithstanding of his aversion to religious exercises, he
</p>
<p>that day* attended twice in meetings of the people, called
</p>
<p>for expressing their thankfulness to the Almighty for his
</p>
<p>late extraordinary interposition in favour of the King.
</p>
<p>First at Leith in the forenoon, where several of the nobili-
</p>
<p>ty met him, and went to church : and in the afternoon at
</p>
<p>Edinburgh, where Galloway, who officiated from the top of
</p>
<p>the Cross instead of a Pulpit, chose for a text the 124th
</p>
<p>Psalm, that his harangue might have some resemblance to
</p>
<p>a sermon, and so make the impression on the minds of the
</p>
<p>audience the deeper. But many parts of his narrative were
</p>
<p>but ill calculated for convincing the incredulous. After
</p>
<p>Galloway had finished, James addressed the populace, from
</p>
<p>the same rostrum, assuring them, that the story which
</p>
<p>they had heard his chaplain relate, was true as gospel.
</p>
<p>But James, finding that the severe steps which he had
</p>
<p>taken, against those who avowed their unbelief in his nar-
</p>
<p>rative, though they certainly did hinder other people from
</p>
<p>declaring their sentiments, were so far from altering them,

</p>
<p>that they rather tended to confirm those, who doubted, at
</p>
<p>length thought proper to try the opposite course. He re-
</p>
<p>laxed a good deal in his rigorous measures against the scep-
</p>
<p>tical clergy, and endeavoured by different methods, to con--
</p>
<p>ciliate the good-will of all who had taken any kind of lead
</p>
<p>in the matter, or were more immediately interested in it.
</p>
<p>For instance, the same day in which Gowry was forfeited,
</p>
<p>James dated a thousand pounds annually to the poor, out
</p>
<p>of the rents of Gowry's estate. That same day too, with
</p>
<p>27*
</p>
<p>the view no doubt, of ingratiating himself with the inhabit
</p>
<p>tants .of Perth, he granted them a charter of confirmation,
</p>
<p>of all their ancient privileges. And besides these, he ap-
</p>
<p>pointed Perth to take precedence of Dundee, in the roll of
</p>
<p>royal boroughs ; a point which had been long keenly litiga-
</p>
<p>ted. And so very forward was he, at this time, to serve
</p>
<p>Perth, that he granted the townsmen certain privileges be-
</p>
<p>longing to Dundee, relative to a monopoly of trade, in cer-
</p>
<p>tain parts of the Tay ; which the Privy Council found ne-
</p>
<p>cessary to retract, within little more than a year after, at
</p>
<p>the complaint of the Dundeesmen. And still the better to
</p>
<p>cajole the people of Perth, within a few months afterwards,
</p>
<p>lie went to that town, and was made a burgess, enrolling
</p>
<p>himself with his own hand.
</p>
<p>But all this coaxing and condescension was thrown a-
</p>
<p>way. For neither at that time, nor at this, nor at any in-
</p>
<p>tervening period, did those who gave themselves the trou-
</p>
<p>ble of thoroughly investigating the matter, and had forti-
</p>
<p>tude to avow their opinions, consider him in any other
</p>
<p>light, than as an unprincipled villain. Indeed Sir Francis
</p>
<p>Osburn tells us, that even at that iiine, no Scotchmen yon
</p>
<p>could meet with beyond sea, but did laugh at the king's ac-
</p>
<p>count of the matter.
</p>
<p>On the other hand however, James assures us, that on
</p>
<p>his way home, in the evening, though the weather was very
</p>
<p>bad, " the whole way was clad with all sort of people," for
</p>
<p>the purpose of congratulating him on his escape. He does
</p>
<p>not condescend on a single person, nor advise us of any
</p>
<p>particulars, further than that some of them were a-foot, and
</p>
<p>others on horseback. Indeed, of the vast number which
</p>
<p>he says waited on him, on his way to Falkland, report has'
</p>
<p>only handed down the name of a solitary individual. This
</p>
<p>is William Moncrieff of Moncrieff. The road from Perth
</p>
<p>to Falkland lay through this Gentleman's property, and

</p>
<p>being of no small consideration, in Lower Strathearn, His
</p>
<p>Highness it seems stopped, and gave him such an account of
</p>
<p>the transactions of the day as he thought proper. Mr
</p>
<p>Moncrieff heard him to Amen : but having in his younger
</p>
<p>days been one of James's body guard, he had become ac-
</p>
<p>quainted with Flis Majesty's character. Therefore, though
</p>
<p>bred a courtier, he replied, " It is a strange story, please
</p>
<p>Your Majesty, if it be true."
</p>
<p>James adds, that a great number of his subjects waited
</p>
<p>175
</p>
<p>on him at Falkland, and Edinburgh, during the following
</p>
<p>ten days, for the like purpose : and that every where, the
</p>
<p>bells were rung, guns fired, and bonfires lighted, as a tes-
</p>
<p>timony of universal joy.
</p>
<p>This is by no means incredible. By a very little ma-
</p>
<p>nagement, such as dispatching emissaries through the coun-
</p>
<p>try, on the same errand, as that on which Baiilie Roy ran
</p>
<p>along the streets of Perth, a little latent loyalty 7 , and a great
</p>
<p>deal of pretended regard would be excited towards James.
</p>
<p>And as the people dispersed through the country could not
</p>
<p>have the same opportunities of coming at the truth, whate-
</p>
<p>ver their suspicions might be, it is not to be wondered at,
</p>
<p>that they did not break out into similar outrages.
</p>
<p>Fourthly, The Royal account of the transaction bore,
</p>
<p>that there was a man in the closet or turret, when the king
</p>
<p>and Alexander entered ; and that he was stationed there,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of assisting in murdering His Majesty.
</p>
<p>As this was the only one present, when Alexander was
</p>
<p>said to have made the attempt on the Royal person, his
</p>
<p>appearance, and avowal of the share which he had in the
</p>
<p>affair, was matter of the utmost importance. But being a
</p>
<p>mere man of straw, it was not without the greatest difficulty,
</p>
<p>that any body could be found, who would take the crime
</p>
<p>upon him, as every one was well acquainted with James's
</p>
<p>cruelty and perfidy, none was willing to trust to his cle-
</p>
<p>mency: especially in a case like this, where it might become
</p>
<p>expedient, for the preservation of His Majesty's honour,
</p>
<p>that they should " seal their testimony with their blood."
</p>
<p>And so completely were the king and his friends baffled for
</p>
<p>a time in their attempts to find one who would personate
</p>
<p>this non-entity, that there is not a circumstance of the whole,
</p>
<p>which more clearly evinces the futility of the Royal nar-
</p>
<p>rative.
</p>
<p>For some days after the fifth of August, James gave out

</p>
<p>that the person, who was in the closet, was named Leslie.
</p>
<p>But it was soon discovered that he would not submit to the
</p>
<p>risque : so another called Gray was pitched on ; but he was
</p>
<p>equally distrustful. One Robert Oliphant, said by some,
</p>
<p>to have been a servant to Gowry, was then given out for
</p>
<p>the man. But he absolutely refusing to take it on him,
</p>
<p>and it appearing, that he could establish an alibi, it was
</p>
<p>laid upon Henry Younger, another servant of the Earl's.
</p>
<p>But, like the rest, he was afraid of the consequences, and
</p>
<p>176
</p>
<p>therefore determined to take no concern in the matter. The
</p>
<p>court, perceiving no end of this, resolved to bring it to a
</p>
<p>conclusion at all events. So when Younger attempted to
</p>
<p>go to Falkland, to expurgate himself, he was met by a party,
</p>
<p>sent from the king, commanded by one Colonel Bruce.
</p>
<p>Younger, aware of his danger, as being a servant of Gow-
</p>
<p>ry's, attempted to secrete himself in a field of corn. But
</p>
<p>Bruce discovered and slew him ; and then carried his corpse
</p>
<p>to Falkland, where it was exposed to public view, as the
</p>
<p>body of a traitor: His Majesty giving out, that it was- the
</p>
<p>identical person whom they found armed in the turret.
</p>
<p>They now plumed themselves not a little, as having at
</p>
<p>length settled this point, in so satisfactory a manner, since,
</p>
<p>by the man's death, there was no danger of his contradicting
</p>
<p>their account. But a sad fatality attended their endeavours
</p>
<p>to establish this part of the story, for they afterwards came
</p>
<p>to learn, that it was publicly known, that Younger was in
</p>
<p>Dundee, at the time of his master's death. It does not,
</p>
<p>however, appear, that James was anywise abashed, from
</p>
<p>being convicted of so many falsehoods. And, indeed, we
</p>
<p>know that his feelings, in such a case, were by no means
</p>
<p>troublesome. He, however, must have felt the disappoint-
</p>
<p>ment, and therefore he resolved to go to work, in quite a
</p>
<p>different way. Instead of fixing the guilt on any one, con-
</p>
<p>trary to that person's inclination, he determined to try what
</p>
<p>effect a bribe would have, in bringing forward somebody to
</p>
<p>assume the character of the armed man in the turret. On
</p>
<p>this, Andrew Henderson, the Earl's factor, partly," no
</p>
<p>doubt, by the consideration, that as one of Gowry's retain-
</p>
<p>ers, he already stood in a hazardous situation ; and partly,
</p>
<p>it is said, at the instigation of Galloway, the court chaplain,
</p>
<p>appeared, and declared himself to have been the man, whom
</p>
<p>James and Alexander found in the turret when they enter-
</p>
<p>ed : and his perjuries on this occasion were eminently ser-
</p>

</p>
<p>viceable. But he was the most unlucky person who could
</p>
<p>have taken up the business, for the king gave out, that the
</p>
<p>person whom he found armed in the closet, was a black,
</p>
<p>grim man, whereas Henderson was a little ruddy-faced, red-
</p>
<p>bearded man. And a day or two afterwards, when James
</p>
<p>related the story to " the Gudeman of Pitmenie," who pro-
</p>
<p>bably had waited on His Majesty, to congratulate him on
</p>
<p>the occasion, the goodman suggested, that probably the man
</p>
<p>in the turret was Henderson, the king replied, " Na, it
</p>
<p>17?
</p>
<p>was not he, I ken that smack well enough*." Yet whett
</p>
<p>none else cduld be found, they were glad to father that cha*
</p>
<p>racter on him.
</p>
<p>Fifthly, So soon after Henderson assumed this charac-
</p>
<p>ter, as they could arrange the several parts of the tale, the
</p>
<p>discourse was published by authority. In a short time a
</p>
<p>terwards, a reply, or counter manifesto, setting forth the
</p>
<p>matter in its true light, written by some friend of the
</p>
<p>Ruthven family, made its appearance. The discovery of a
</p>
<p>copy of this performance would now be a valuable acquisi-
</p>
<p>tion ; but there is no probability that any such exists, as
</p>
<p>the government instantly ordered the publication to be sup-
</p>
<p>pressed, an order which, we fear, has been successfully
</p>
<p>executed.
</p>
<p>Here, again, is another evidence of James's guilt. If
</p>
<p>he was innocent, why prevent the matter from being Can-
</p>
<p>vassed ? Truth never suffers by investigation ; and in every
</p>
<p>case, an accused person, if conscious of his innocence, will
</p>
<p>court an enquiry into his conduct, but more especially when
</p>
<p>sensible that the public opinion runs so much against him,
</p>
<p>as James found that it did against himself, on this occasion.
</p>
<p>He was extremely anxious to have the world believe him
</p>
<p>innocent; so much so, indeed, that notwithstanding the
</p>
<p>known cruelty of his disposition, and the imbecility of his
</p>
<p>intellects, on few occasions did his ferocious temper break
</p>
<p>forth with such virulence, as it did on this, against every one
</p>
<p>who dared express a doubt of his account of the massacre
</p>
<p>of the two brothers. Yet he employed the power which he
</p>
<p>possessed, as sovereign, to quash this attempt to clear up
</p>
<p>the pretended mystery, the only one of the kind, as far as
</p>
<p>we know, which was made at that time, well aware that
</p>
<p>the best way to prevent the indication of his guilt, with
</p>
<p>which the neighbourhood was then well acquainted, from
</p>
<p>spreading, and being perpetuated, was to stifle all enquiry

</p>
<p>into the matter.
</p>
<p>Sixthly, Another contrivance to escape detection, was
</p>
<p>the taking away the lives of Cranston, Craigingelt, and the
</p>
<p>officer on the Strathearn estate, before the trial of the two
</p>
<p>brothers. Even on the supposition of all that James al-
</p>
<p>leges being true, there evidently is a great deficiency in the
</p>
<p>proof. It is only on circumstantial evidence, that the Earl
</p>
<p>of Gowry was convicted. The three persons above men-
</p>
<p>* Calderwood-
</p>
<p>178
</p>
<p>tioned were only accused of being accessaries. No other*
</p>
<p>of the servants were ever discovered to have been engaged
</p>
<p>in the plot, excepting Henderson, and he was said to de-
</p>
<p>clare, all along, that he knew nothing of the matter, being
</p>
<p>put into the turret, merely, it would appear, as a post to hang
</p>
<p>the dagger on, that it might be at hand, when wanted to
</p>
<p>butcher the king. The Ruthvens of Freeland, Moncriefi^
</p>
<p>and Eviot, all had thought it prudent to abscond, so that
</p>
<p>there was not a single witness who could say that the Earl
</p>
<p>was engaged in the conspiracy, unless it shoukl be the three
</p>
<p>servants who were in custody. In such circumstances, we
</p>
<p>presume, it is not in the power of any rational person to
</p>
<p>believe that the crown would have deprived itself of the be-
</p>
<p>nefit of the accomplices, in the conviction of the principals,
</p>
<p>if it had not been aware that their declarations would have
</p>
<p>been hostile to its designs. But so intent was the govern-
</p>
<p>ment to make sure work of the taking away their lives, that
</p>
<p>several of the king's domestics, and those who were con-
</p>
<p>cerned in the murder at Perth, were appointed their jud-
</p>
<p>ges. Although the pannels might have foreseen that their
</p>
<p>case was helpless, they nevertheless objected to this; an ob-
</p>
<p>jection which would have been sustained, had the smallest
</p>
<p>regard been paid to decency, not to say justice. There
</p>
<p>was, however, little probability in disinterested and dispas-
</p>
<p>sionate judges taking these men's lives, therefore, it being
</p>
<p>thought necessary that the king's dependants, and associates
</p>
<p>in the murder shoukl be retained for this purpose, the ob-
</p>
<p>jection was repelled. And not a doubt can remain of the
</p>
<p>innocence of the three servants ; 'even Spottiswood informs
</p>
<p>us that they declared, in their last moments, that they were
</p>
<p>perfectly innocent of every kind of design on the king, and
</p>
<p>that they were ignorant of the Earl of Gowry, or his bro-
</p>
<p>ther, being engaged in any such enterprise : and Spottis-
</p>
<p>wood was a staunch friend of James's.

</p>
<p>Seventhly, A circumstance no less ludicrous, is the punc-
</p>
<p>tuality with which the letter of the law was followed out at
</p>
<p>the trial, in some matters which were absolutely of no im-
</p>
<p>portance, whilst equity, or the spirit of justice, was outrag-
</p>
<p>ed in a most shameful manner.
</p>
<p>The 4th of November was the day appointed for the tri-
</p>
<p>al, and, as none of the parties summoned appeared, except
</p>
<p>the dead bodies of the Earl and the Honourable Alexander
</p>
<p>Jluthven, the court was not satisfied with the production
</p>
<p>m
</p>
<p>of the execution of the summons in the ordinary way, %
</p>
<p>for the greater certification, took the oaths of the officers 1 ,
</p>
<p>stating, that they had duly served the summons, and ad-
</p>
<p>journed to the 9th, under pretence e>f affording the accused
</p>
<p>a few days more, for appearing. This vas done although
</p>
<p>they well knew, that they had already proscribed those per-
</p>
<p>sons, and had endeavoured to apprehend ther* as traitors,
</p>
<p>deserving the fate of the two brothers ; and had di^harged
</p>
<p>all of the name of Ruthven from coming near the place
</p>
<p>where the king was, under the pain of treason ; and only a
</p>
<p>month before, had, by royal proclamation, ordered all of
</p>
<p>them out of the kingdom. On the 9th this was repeated,
</p>
<p>with the addition of letters of Relaxation, produced by the
</p>
<p>crown lawyer, freeing the parties from trouble on every o-
</p>
<p>ther account, excepting the charge of treason, and then ad-
</p>
<p>journed to the 15th. On that day the farce was a third
</p>
<p>time repeated, before proceeding to the trial.
</p>
<p>Perhaps lawyers consider these formalities as necessary,
</p>
<p>and for ought we know, they are so ; but in the present case,
</p>
<p>we are certain that nothing was further from the desire of
</p>
<p>those who so strictly enforced the observance of them, than
</p>
<p>the rigorous dispensation of justice ; otherwise they would
</p>
<p>not have suffered Lennox, Mar, Ramsay, Erskin, and Wil-
</p>
<p>son, who were implicated in the charge of murdering the
</p>
<p>two brothers, to be witnesses ; nor Lennox and Mar to sit
</p>
<p>judges in the trial, and even to be of the number of the lords
</p>
<p>of the articles, to whom the examination of the witnesses
</p>
<p>was exclusively committed.
</p>
<p>This was straining at a gnat, yet swallowing a camel.
</p>
<p>In our own country, we do not recollect ever to have heard
</p>
<p>of so gross a mockery of justice.
</p>
<p>Eighthly, The extirpation of the whole males of the house
</p>
<p>of Gowry, evidently formed part of the plot. The two
</p>
<p>youngest brothers, William and Patrick, resided at Dirl-
</p>

</p>
<p>ton, with their mother. There was much danger in allow-
</p>
<p>ing them to survive. Instances, not a few, occur in histo-
</p>
<p>ry, where a single shoot, being overlooked in rooting out
</p>
<p>a family, has not only continued the family tree, but
</p>
<p>sometimes encreased so as to overwhelm its oppressors.
</p>
<p>James doubtless considered, that if the two youths were pre-
</p>
<p>served, and should remain in the country unmolested, the
</p>
<p>time might come when they would have interest sufficient
</p>
<p>to procure a revisal of the proceedings against their fami*
</p>
<p>186
</p>
<p>iy, which certainly would have issued in a reversal. Or
</p>
<p>they might have formed a party strong enough to do them-
</p>
<p>selves justice, without having recourse to law. Therefore,
</p>
<p>some days before the death of the two brothers, James wrote
</p>
<p>to the Hon. Wilk'am Ruthven, the next eldest brother,
</p>
<p>who then resided at Dirlton with his mother, to meet him
</p>
<p>at Perth on the 5th of August; and when this mode of
</p>
<p>ensnaring them proved unsuccessful, an attempt was made
</p>
<p>on the succeeding evening [August 6th,] to apprehend
</p>
<p>both the younger brothers, but getting notice of the design,
</p>
<p>they escaped into England. We know that rarely do the
</p>
<p>politically unfortunate experience friendship at the hands of
</p>
<p>a courtier ; however, as Kennedy, who sent the young gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen the notice, is said to have once been a servant to
</p>
<p>their father, perhaps he was an exception to this. But a-
</p>
<p>wake as our suspicions are, we confess that it seems not at
</p>
<p>all unlikely, that he was an agent of the royal party. Be-
</p>
<p>cause, had the young men stood their ground, and dared
</p>
<p>the court to convict them of being concerned in any trai-
</p>
<p>torous design, they might have proved a rallying point for
</p>
<p>the adherents of their family, and embarrassed James and
</p>
<p>his party not a little. They might not only have defended
</p>
<p>themselves, but evinced the innocence of their elder bro-
</p>
<p>thers. No alternative then remained for the court, but ei-
</p>
<p>ther to seize or cut them off by some means or other ; or to
</p>
<p>intimidate them so as to make them quit the country. And
</p>
<p>it is not impossible that Kennedy was employed for the lat-
</p>
<p>ter purpose.
</p>
<p>Such are the arguments on which the several theories,
</p>
<p>that have been advanced for elucidating this controverted
</p>
<p>portion of history, rest* It is not here meant to make any
</p>
<p>recapitulation, or additional observations. Every one will
</p>
<p>judge for himself; and no one, whose mind is unbiassed by
</p>
<p>prejudice or interest, can be at a loss how to decide.
