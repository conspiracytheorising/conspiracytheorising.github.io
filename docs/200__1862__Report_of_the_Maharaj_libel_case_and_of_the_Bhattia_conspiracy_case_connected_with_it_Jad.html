<p>PEEFACE.
</p>
<p>The following sheets have been compiled and put in this form
</p>
<p>with a view to give an extended circulation to the proceedings of
</p>
<p>a trial which has created an unparalleled sensation on this side of
</p>
<p>India. They contain a full report of the Maharaj Libel case,*
</p>
<p>together with a copious account of the origin, trial and conclusion
</p>
<p>of the Bhattia Conspiracy, which arose out of the pleas put in by
</p>
<p>the defendants. The argument in the demurrer first hied by the
</p>
<p>Defendants is also given in full.
</p>
<p>The Maharaj Libel case is in all respects a most extraordinary
</p>
<p>one. The plaintiff belonged to a fraternity, the members of which
</p>
<p>pretended individually and collectively, to be incarnations of God and
</p>
<p>according to the spirit of their theological works, even superior to
</p>
<p>God himself. Their inequitous pretensions are tacitly acknowledged
</p>
<p>and openly avowed by all their followers. Human nature rises in
</p>
<p>rebellion against the morality of a theology wdiich sanctions and
</p>
<p>imperatively enjoins adultery and fornication with its teachers as the
</p>
<p>only means of salvation !
</p>
<p>If it be said that the Maharajas exercise absolute control over
</p>
<p>the minds and bodies of their votaries, it would be a statement
</p>
<p>that falls short of the truth. Adultery with them is not only en-
</p>
<p>joined but an absolute necessity without which no man can expect
</p>
<p>happiness in this world or bliss in the next. A course of bestial
</p>
<p>licentiousness is their beatitude of heaven. The consequences of this
</p>
<p>horrid and revolting superstition, were unfolded for the first time
</p>
<p>before a judicial tribunal in the case of Jadunathjee Brizrattanjee
</p>
<p>Maharaj vs. Karsandass Mooljee. The cause of morality, it was
</p>
<p>expected, could not but gain by the trial and the defendant with
</p>
<p>honest confidence in the justiness of his cause accepted the challenge
</p>
<p>and in turn dared the challenger. The eyes of India were rivetted
</p>
<p>* The varioiis extracts and translations produced during the trial arc also published in this report.

</p>
<p>on the proceedings. The disclosures in court startled the outside
</p>
<p>world. They were revelations of a theology the most hateful, a
</p>
<p>morality the most outrageous and filthy, a body of religious guides
</p>
<p>who may be described as living incarnations of Satan. Nor was the
</p>
<p>extraordinary sensation produced by these revelations confined to the
</p>
<p>native community. It was a subject of almost daily comment in the
</p>
<p>English society and newspapers. Some watched the proceedings with
</p>
<p>anxiety, many with mingled hope and fear lest by some mischance
</p>
<p>the work of reform may be indefinitely postponed, and all with interest.
</p>
<p>The fierce zeal with which the plaintiif sought to crush the defen-
</p>
<p>dant, by all the means in his power, will not be a matter of sur-
</p>
<p>prise, when we reflect that to him it was a life-and-death struggle.
</p>
<p>He must either confound his assailant, or submit to the just criti-
</p>
<p>cisms of the press, which cannot in the long run fail to undermine
</p>
<p>his power to corrupt and defile the homes and beds of hundreds of
</p>
<p>families. The defendant and his friends did what the law expected
</p>
<p>them to do. To them it was a labour of love. Fresh from the
</p>
<p>perusal of works, imbued with a healthy tone of morality, they could
</p>
<p>not tolerate relig-ious vice or relia-ioi^s debauchees. Some idea of the
</p>
<p>firm hold which this loathsome system ot religion has on the minds
</p>
<p>of its followers, may be formed from the fact that nine of the most
</p>
<p>respectable leading members of the Phattia caste, who in their com-
</p>
<p>mercial dealings daily come in contact with civilized influences, from
</p>
<p>sincere religious convictions, oi'ganized a conspiracy to defeat the ends
</p>
<p>of justice, Ijy threatening to put in motion, that most terrible engine
</p>
<p>of punishment in India  social excommunication.
</p>
<p>The trial of the libel case occupied full twenty-four days. In this
</p>
<p>respect it is quite unprecedented in the annals of judicial administration
</p>
<p>in India. The ordinary reader cannot but rise from the perusal of the
</p>
<p>report with a sjjontaneous conviction that it has afforded him a more
</p>
<p>accurate glimpse into the interior of a section of native society, than
</p>
<p>that which could be had from works professedly treating of native
</p>
<p>manners and customs. The report cannot also fail to be of material
</p>
<p>value and impoi-tance to professional men embodying as it does the

<p>THE MAHARAJ LIBEL CASE,
</p>
<p>THE ALLEGED LIBEL.
</p>
<p>(Official Translation of an Editorial Article in the " Snfi/a Prakash" Gujrati Newspaper,
</p>
<p>of the 2\st October, 1860.)
</p>
<p>THE PRIMITIVE RELIGION OF THE HINDUS AND THE PRESENT
</p>
<p>HETJiROlJOX OPINIONS.
</p>
<p>In the Purans and other Shasiras of the Hindus it is stated that in the
</p>
<p>Kaliyitg there will arise false religions and heresies, and impostors and heretics will
</p>
<p>cause adverse pers'iasions and adverse religious systems to be established. According
</p>
<p>to the Hindu Shasiras five thousand years have now passed away since t\ie commence-
</p>
<p>ment of the Kaliyug. From the Hindu S'/astras themselves it is demonstrated that
</p>
<p>during this period of five thousand years as many new persuasions and religious systems
</p>
<p>as have arisen among the Hindus, should all be considered spurious hensies. Now, four
</p>
<p>hundred years have not as yet elapsed since the birth of VakiM, the projenitor of the
</p>
<p>Maharajas. In the books of tlie Vaishnava persuasion it is written that the birth of
</p>
<p>Valabhacliarya took place on the 11th of Waisakh Tad of Samvant 1535, the day
</p>
<p>of the week Sunday ; since this event 381 years have elapsed to this day, and since
</p>
<p>the beginning of the KaViyxg five thousand years have passed. The sect of ValabJiacharya
</p>
<p>then originated wiihin the Kal'niwj itself. In the same way as the followers of Dada,
</p>
<p>the followers of Sad/ni, the R msneld, the Ramanandi, the SIteJanandi and other sects
</p>
<p>arose ; so the sect of Va'abhacharya arose ; all these sects have arisen in the KaVyug,
</p>
<p>therefore according to the declarations of the Hindu Shasiras they must be heterodox.
</p>
<p>Jadunathjee Maharaj snys that in the same way as sonr.e one goes from the gates
</p>
<p>of the fort to proceed to Walkeshwar and some one to Bjculla, so exa^ tly the original
</p>
<p>courses of the Veds and the Purans having gone forward, have diverged into different
</p>
<p>ways. What a deceitful proposition this is. Out of one religious system ten or fifteen
</p>
<p>by-ways must not branch off. The course of religion and of morals must be one cnly.
</p>
<p>What necessity is there to quit the straight road by which to go to Walkeshwar, and
</p>
<p>take the circuitous route of Bycalla ? Each sectary has made every other sectary a
</p>
<p>heretic, and one has scattered dust upon tb.e other ; what then is the necessity for
</p>
<p>acting thus ? But we have already made known that as regards the weapons with
</p>
<p>which the Maharaj has come forth to defend himself, those very weapons will oppose
</p>
<p>the Maharaj, and annoy him. The JNIaharaj considers the Hindu Shustras as the work
</p>
<p>of GoJ ; he cannot then assert any patticular statement of the Hindu Shastras is
</p>
<p>false. The said Maharaj cannot allege that the statement that in the Kaliyug here-
</p>

</p>
<p>tical opinions will ariae, is false. Then like several other sects, the sect of the Maha-
</p>
<p>rajas has arisen in the Kaliyug, consequently it is established by the Hindu Shastras
</p>
<p>that it is a false and heretical one.
</p>
<p>The sect of the Maharajas is heretical and one delusive to simple people ; that
</p>
<p>is proved by the genuine books of the Veds, the Piirans, &c., according to what is
</p>
<p>intimated above. Not only this, but also from the works composed by the Maharajas,
</p>
<p>it is proved that the Maharajas have raised up nothing but a new heresy and dis-
</p>
<p>order. Behold y/ith regard to the subject of Bramh how Gokulnathji has amplified
</p>
<p>the original stanza, what a commentary he has made : 
</p>
<p>^tWTlfi- ^?[T H[7T[?q;l^^ ^f^^JT^^ HI^rj^lCRR
</p>
<p>Fr^[R ^R[R^^^^[^?^^'-f : II 3 II
</p>
<p>" Consequently before he himself has enjoyed her, he should make over his own
</p>
<p>married wife (to the Maharaj), and he should also make over (to him) his sons and
</p>
<p>daughters. After having got married, he should before having himself enjoyed his wife
</p>
<p>make an offering of her (to the Maharaj) ; after which he should apply her to his
</p>
<p>own use."
</p>
<p>Alas ! what a heresy this is, what a sham this is, and what a delusion this is ! We
</p>
<p>ask Jadunathjee Maharaj in what Ved, in what Paran., in what Shastra, and in
</p>
<p>what law-book it is written that one's married wife should be made over to a Maharaj
</p>
<p>or to a religious preceptor before being enjoyed. Not only one's wife, but one's daughter
</p>
<p>also is to be made over ! Alas ! in writing this, our pen will not move on. We are
</p>
<p>seized with utter disgust and agitation. To render blind people who see with their eyes
</p>
<p>and to throw dust in their eyes, and in the name of religion and under the pretence
</p>
<p>of religion to enjoy their tender maidens, wives and daughters, than this what greater
</p>
<p>heresy and what greater deceit ? In the Kaliyug many other heresies and many sects
</p>
<p>have arisen besides .hat of Valabhacharya, but no other sectaries have ever perpetrat-
</p>
<p>ed, such shamelessness, subtilty, immodesty, rascality, and deceit as have the sect of the
</p>
<p>Maharajas. When we use such severe terms as these, our simple Hindu friends are
</p>
<p>wroth with us, and in consequence of that wrath of theirs, we have had and have
</p>
<p>much to endure. But when throwing dust in the eyes of simple people, the Maharajas
</p>
<p>write in their books about enjoying the tender maidens,  the peoples' wives and daughters,
</p>
<p>and they enjoy them accordingly, great flames spring up within our inside, our pen at
</p>
<p>once becomes heated on fire, and we have to grieve over our Hindu friends and over
</p>
<p>their weak powers of reflection.
</p>
<p>Jadunathjee Maharaj has commenced issuing a small work styled " The Propagator
</p>
<p>of our own Religion' ; we ask him in what way do you wish to effect the propagation

</p>
<p>of religion ? Your ancestors having scattered dust in the eyes of simple people, made
</p>
<p>them blind ? Do you wish to make them see, or taking a false pride in the upholding
</p>
<p>of your religion, do you wish to delude simple people still more ? Jadunathjee Maharaj,
</p>
<p>should you wish to propogate or to spread abroad religion, then do you personally adopt
</p>
<p>a. virtuous course of conduct and admonish your other Maharajas. As long as the pre-
</p>
<p>ceptors of religion shall themselves appear to be immersed in the sea of licentiousness
</p>
<p>for so long they shall not be competent to convey religious exhortation. Gokulnathji
</p>
<p>having com[)Osed the commentary abovementioned, has attached to your Vaishnam persuasion
</p>
<p>a great blot of ink. Let that be first removed. Scorn the writer of the commentary.
</p>
<p>[Oh, you] Maharajas, acting up to that commentary, defile the wives and daughters of
</p>
<p>your devotees. Desist from that and destroy at once immorality such as that of the
</p>
<p>company at the Ras ffsticcd. As long as you shall not do so, for so long you cannot
</p>
<p>give religious admonition, and propogate your own religious faith ; do you be pleased
</p>
<p>to be assured of that.

</p>
<p>traordinary respect and pre-eminence have been and still are awarded, by all good and

<p>accordingly to the belief and opinion of all good and worthy Hindus, the said persons

<p>ing to injure the plaintiff, his good character, of a Braha.nin and in his said character

<p>and concerning such other circumstances as aforesaid, a certain false, scandalous, malicious,
</p>
<p>infamous and defamatiry libel, which said false, scandalous, malicious, infamous, and
</p>
<p>defamatory libel was by the defendant printed and published and caused to be printed
</p>
<p>and published in the same newspaper on the day and year aforesaid at Bombay aforesaid,
</p>
<p>in the Gujratee language, and character, and was and is accordingly to the tenor and

<p>SUPREME COURT.-Plea Side.
</p>
<p>(Before the Hon'ble Sir M Sausse, Kt., Chief Justice.)
</p>
<p>First Day, Tuesday, 2nd July 1861.
</p>
<p>Jad'inatlijee Brisraltonjee Maharaj vs. Karsandass Mooljee and another.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley, with Mr. Scohle, instructed by Messrs. Collier and Leathes, appeared
</p>
<p>for the plaintiff".
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey, with Mr. Dunbar, instiucted by Messrs. Acland and Prentis, for the
</p>
<p>defendants.
</p>
<p>This case was set down for argument on a demurrer filed by the defendants. The
</p>
<p>demurrer was on vai'ious grounds to show that the plaintiff had no hcics standi in the

</p>
<p>Court in that form of plaint.
</p>
<p>6
</p>
<p>Mr. Baijlet/ took a preliminary objection that the defendants could not be heard
</p>
<p>on the ground that they had not complied with the Rule of the Court No. 19 of
</p>
<p>1825, which required that on the margin of the demurrer and paper books, some at least
</p>
<p>of the grounds of demurrer shouldjfir be specified.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ans'ey submitted that the rule had been complied with and that sufficient
</p>
<p>cause had been set forth to  entitle the demurrer to be entertained. He adduced
</p>
<p>English authorities in support.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice said there was no rule in this Court which prohibited a special
</p>
<p>demurrer. But the Court has, since he had the honor of presiding here, discoui-aged
</p>
<p>such demurrers. There was no rule prohibiting a special demurrer, and therefore a
</p>
<p>party cannot be said to have no right to file one. He thought that under the authorities,
</p>
<p>the reference given in the margin to the grounds in the body was sufficient, and he
</p>
<p>could not refuse to proceed with the hearing.
</p>
<p>The objection having been overruled,
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey opened his argument by stating that a certain Jadunathjee Brizruttonjee
</p>
<p>Maharaj was the plaintiff, and two persons, Karsandass Mooljee, a Hindoo, and
</p>
<p>Kanabhoy Eustamjee Raneena, a Parsi, were the defendants.
</p>
<p>He stated that the plaint set forth was clearly open on the face of it to a general
</p>
<p>demurrer, not included in the special grounds. That general ground was public policy.
</p>
<p>The grounds of demurrer set forth specially are as follows :  First that in the plaint, it
</p>
<p>was not stated, alleged, or specified that the alleged improper and heterodox opinions
</p>
<p>surmised to have been imputed to the plaintiff, are or in what manner and to
</p>
<p>what extent they are improper and heterodox according to the Hindu religion or
</p>
<p>that of the Valabhacharya, or what were or are the doctrines of the said religion
</p>
<p>or sect. Secondly, it was not stated, ic. what the alleged offences and improper
</p>
<p>conduct are, and to what extent, if they are to any extent, contrary to the said
</p>
<p>religion or the doctrines of the said sect on the alleged custom or practice in force
</p>
<p>in Bombay and other parts of India. Thirdly, it was not stated, &c. what is the alleged
</p>
<p>custom, usage, &c., and by what persons and sects the same is followed and observed
</p>
<p>and in particular whether the same is a Hindu or a Christian usage, &c. Fourthly,
</p>
<p>it is nowhere stated that it is contrary to the doctrine or discipline or custom, &c. of
</p>
<p>the Hindus, kc. for the Maharajs under pretence of religion, to enjoy the tender maidens,
</p>
<p>wives, and daughters of the people. Fifthly, for that there is no specific offence charged
</p>
<p>against the defendants or either of them. Sixthly, it is not stated, &c. in what sense
</p>

</p>
<p>the expressions " heterodox opinion" and " offence and improper conduct" are understood
</p>
<p>or applied by the plaintiff or the Maharajs, or the Hindus generally. Seventhly, that
</p>
<p>the said expressions are insensible and ambiguous, and have no meaning in law. Eighthly,
</p>
<p>that the several inuendoes, alleging that the plaintiff and other Maharajs are guilty ot
</p>
<p>rascality and shameful conduct, and defile the wives and daughters of their devotees
</p>
<p>and other Hindus by criminal intercourse with them, &c., are not warranted by the
</p>
<p>words of the supposed libel, nor supported by any inducement or introductory averment
</p>
<p>to which the inuendoes refer. Ninthly, that alleged translation is altogether incorrect,
</p>
<p>and the sense of it repugnant, and at variance with the alleged libel. Tenthly, that
</p>
<p>there are divers clerical errors in setting forth the libel, whereby the translation and
</p>
<p>libel are unintelligible and insensible. And, eleventhly, that there are omissions of
</p>
<p>/
</p>
<p>material statements and averments, especially as to the alleged commentary and book
</p>
<p>published by one Gokalnathjee and by the plaintiff himself, and to which the alleged
</p>
<p>libel purports to be a reply.
</p>
<p>31): Anstey would tirst contend that on the grounds of public policy, the Court
</p>
<p>should not entertain such an action. He had made many researches and enquiries, and
</p>
<p>not an instance could be discovered of an attempt like this, wherein a Maharaj or
</p>
<p>Hindu High Priest, sought, by the machinery of Her Majesty's Courts, or by that of
</p>
<p>the late East India Company's Courts, to enforce the discipline of his sect. It behoved
</p>
<p>the Court to decline to lend its jurisdiction to such uses : else it might be that the
</p>
<p>Court would find itself helping some impure sect for the propagation of most immoral,
</p>
<p>irreligious, and beastly doctrines. Now what is the origin asserted by the Maharaj ? If
</p>
<p>one can discover any meaning of the plaint, the plaintiff is a priest of a sect which
</p>
<p>came into biith in the sixteenth century, at the same time when our gracious King
</p>
<p>Henry VIII. purified his own Church by much the same means. He is regarded with
</p>
<p>singular respect amongst the Brahmins, who in their turn are similarly revered by the
</p>
<p>Hindus :  and disregarding his duty as a Hindu to venerate the Maharaj, the
</p>
<p>defendant employed his leisure time to set at nought the authority of the Maharaj and
</p>
<p>expose the immoral doctrines of the sect. It was declared that the Maharaj was
</p>
<p>entitled to a different treatment, but that not having been so treated by the defendant
</p>
<p>he was disparaged and lowered in the eyes of his devotees, and therefore he claimed
</p>
<p>these damages. Mr. Anstey said that on the face of the plaint it was clearly a spiritual
</p>
<p>offence for which the plaintiff sued, for the plaint s.4s forth his spiritual ascendancy
</p>
<p>over the Hindus. It was contrary to public policy that he should be allowed to come into
</p>
<p>this Court, for it was not a libel cencerning his private character, but against his
</p>
<p>office as Maharaj. He (Mr. Anstey) could find no authority for such a suit, where
</p>
<p>a heathen priest attempted to establish his spiritual ascendancy by means of an action
</p>
<p>for libel. The rule of non-interference in religion has been laid down in the Acts of
</p>
<p>Parliament, and applied by Charter to India, and the learned counsel urged, that
</p>
<p>this Court would not allow that good rule to be violated in a matter where it was
</p>
<p>impossible to know before-hand the enormity of the mischief likely to result from such
</p>
<p>interference. Suppose, for illustration, that the defendants are religious reformers, whose
</p>
<p>sole view is to promote the truths of natural religion and to get rid of all superstitions
</p>
<p>and religious abuses, which are but of very modern growth, and not to be traced to
</p>
<p>the mysterious past, will not the Court take it to be against public policy to entertain

</p>
<p>a suit to stop them ? a suit by which it is endeavoured to support the ill-gotten
</p>
<p>authority and presumed ascendancy of the plaintiff? and will not public policy refuse to
</p>
<p>allow such authority to extinguish the progress of reformation in a smooth and
</p>
<p>unobstructed course ? He (Mr. Anstey) found his own view to be always entertained by
</p>
<p>the Charter Courts. In the Asiatic Journal for May 1832 was the report of a Hindu
</p>
<p>case of breach of promise of marriage, in which the Chief Justice who decided
</p>
<p>it, observed that all Hindu religious matters and usages should be kept out of the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court. In the case of the Khojas and Memons, reported in Sir Erskine
</p>
<p>Peiry's Oriental Cases, p. 122, his Lordship laid down the doctrines, which Mr.
</p>
<p>Anstey conceived to be that of this Court (reads the passage). With reference to
</p>
<p>the same question in the case of Ardaseer Cursetjee vs. Perozebye, 10 Moore's Privy
</p>
<p>Council Cases, p. 414-19, the Lords of Council are found expressing themselves thus
</p>
<p>(reads the passage). On the authority of this case, which is so strong in point, will
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>the Court lend itself to support this ecclesiastic, this Maharaj to enforce his spiritual
</p>
<p>authority ? If the scene were changed from India to England, where the Judges take
</p>
<p>cognisance of spiritual suits, even there this Court would not lend its jurisdiction to
</p>
<p>the Church Kstabiished, inasmuch as although the Ecclesiastical or Courts Christian
</p>
<p>exist there, a Court of Common Law never intervenes, and declines to entertain such
</p>
<p>matters, and refers parties to those Courts. This is carried so far that, where the
</p>
<p>Ecclesiastical Court has power to entertain an action of defamation, the Court of Common
</p>
<p>Law never assumes a concurrent jurisdiction to ent ain such a suit, as partaking of
</p>
<p>an ecclesiastical nature in illustration of his arguments. Mr. Anstey contended that
</p>
<p>either this action was im[)roperly brought, because his lordship had not the judicial
</p>
<p>knowledge of the Hindu doctrines, usages, &c , and especially of the modern sect of
</p>
<p>Yalabliacharya, upon which plaintiff based his authority, and consequently his lordship
</p>
<p>must disallow the suit from going on ; or that this Court being not congnisant of
</p>
<p>those matters, the plaint was faulty in not setting forth what those doctrines, &c. are.
</p>
<p>To test this he would assume the first of the alternatives just named to be true. He
</p>
<p>would therefore read from authorised works on Maharaj doctrine and practice, what are
</p>
<p>the enormous and horrid canons of faith and morals, of which his Lordship was by
</p>
<p>the plaint assumed to be judicially cognisant.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley.  We are to argue the demurrer ; the facts are admitted. As to
</p>
<p>what the Valabhacharya sect is, we have nothing to do.
</p>
<p>jJ/r. Anstey.  I say you have, unless your assumption is wrong, that his Lordsip
</p>
<p>has judicial cognisance of those sects and doctrines.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice.  I say I have no such knowledga nor am I called upon to
</p>
<p>have it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey said that the second alternative therefore was now the only one open to the
</p>
<p>plaintiff, namely that the Court was confined to so much of his doctrine and discipline as was
</p>
<p>properly averred in his plaint That averment was demurrable tor its insufficiency. The first
</p>
<p>point in the demurrer was that it was not stated or specified in the plaint what the alleged
</p>
<p>heterodox opinions or the sect of Valabhacharya were, 'i'lie learned counsel contended that it
</p>
<p>ought to have been so stated, and the plaint was therefore bad, and the reason for that was
</p>
<p>that in every action the defendant has right to an answer, to have the alleged libel set
</p>
<p>forth fully, and that the statement on the face of the plaint must be such as to enable
</p>
<p>the Court to give judgment as opinion on law, in support of which argument he referred
</p>
<p>to two cases, Solomon vs. Lawson, 8 Q B. 823 and Cartwright vs. Anderson, 5 B. and A.

</p>
<p>In the first of these the omission of a letter in the count for libel, and in the second
</p>
<p>that of a word in a document were held material to the plaint. Again when libel is
</p>
<p>set out, there must be by way of inducement or inuendo, or both, sufficient averments,
</p>
<p>to explain the libel, and if there are not such avern ents, then it is no libel. For
</p>
<p>want of such necessary averments to connect the libel with the introductory matter, the
</p>
<p>plaint is held insufRcient, Grey vs. Cooper 9 L. J. 9 Exchequer, and Robinson vs. Clarke.
</p>
<p>To call a person a " damned fool," and a clergyman a " dunce," were not held libel
</p>
<p>[cases cited.] It has been well settled as a duty incumbent on the non-conformists to set
</p>
<p>forth the doctrines and practices of their body to enable the Court to judge of inuendoes
</p>
<p>connecting them with libel, Ilartley vs. Ilerrick, 8 Ttrm Reports. In the present casft
</p>
<p>it should have been shown by positive averment that the plaintiff wjw a lawful priest.
</p>
<p>9
</p>
<p>for he sued as priest, and that his sect was a sect capable of being protected at law
</p>
<p>and that he was liable, and how, to be damaged by the slander. In another case it
</p>
<p>has been held not a libel to publish of a Catholic j)riest that he imposed a degrading
</p>
<p>penance upon a man, in the absence ot the averment that such would expose him to.
</p>
<p>the censure of his superiors. The same doctrine pervaded our law, and Mr. Anstey
</p>
<p>remembered the Lord Justice Knight Bruce, when Vice Chancellor, refusing to grant
</p>
<p>injunction for ejecting a clergyman from the pulpit, on ground that the affidavit was
</p>
<p>insufficient to show that the sect, to which he belonged, had the same view of the
</p>
<p>decencies of spiritual hfe and morals as the rest of the English world. In Burn's
</p>
<p>Ecclesiastical Law, he found it clearly laid down that a man cannot be proceeded against
</p>
<p>in a temporal court for mere heresy, except where the Statute made such offence
</p>
<p>punishable by law. The learned counsel here pointed out the distinction between a written
</p>
<p>and an unwritten slander, and said that in order to constitute a libel of an imputation
</p>
<p>on your conduct in profession, it must be such an imputation as to make it probable
</p>
<p>that you would be injured in your circumstances. Suppose that the plaintiff had professed
</p>
<p>to be a priest of the goddess Bhowanee, but not being recognised as an authority, he
</p>
<p>deserves no protection of law, and no amount of imputation on his illegal profession could
</p>
<p>be construed into libel. In Morrison vs. Langdori, 2 Fuller 724, the Court refused to
</p>
<p>entertain the action for libel brought by a jobber for being called a " lame duck." In
</p>
<p>other cases it has been laid down that where the imputation was cast upon one appearing
</p>
<p>on the face of the count to be unworthy of the protection of law, in libel he could not recover. The
</p>
<p>learned counsel then went on to remark upon the law of libel as regards an alien. It had been
</p>
<p>at one time held that an alien cannot sue on ground that he had no local allegiance, and
</p>
<p>was a resident abroad ; but now it has been held that he can but that he ought to show
</p>
<p>that he has some ground to invoke the protection of law. These cases, said Mr. Anstey, would
</p>
<p>apply strongly to the present case in one of H. M.'s Chartered Courts, because it has
</p>
<p>been so decided by the highest authority, viz., Lord Brougham's judgment in the case
</p>
<p>of Mayor of Lyons vs. The E. I. Co. We have possessed India, and especially Bombay,
</p>
<p>for a period of 201 years by right of conquest and free gift, and during that period
</p>
<p>no action of this sort has ever come before the Court, which furnishes a cogent argument
</p>
<p>that no law existed to warrant the bringing of it, and this law of defamation of a
</p>
<p>spiritual man was never communicated to the Natives by the Crown. Mr. Anstey now
</p>
<p>came to the objection that the words " improper conduct," &c., were insensible and
</p>
<p>ambiguous, which therefore constituted a good ground of demurrer. In Evans vs. Hutton,

</p>
<p>6 vol. Jurist 1052, the words " Her Majesty's Government" were held ambiguous,
</p>
<p>&c. Who was to define the words ? the plaintiff talked of a custom and usage, but
</p>
<p>he did not define whose custom or usage, what was improper, what was heterodox,
</p>
<p>and according to what doctrine, for there were a thousand sects of Hindus, each hating
</p>
<p>the other. A Reverend friend (Dr. Wilson) had very properly asked, how can we
</p>
<p>define what is " heterodoxy,"  that is " the other opinion," until we know what " the
</p>
<p>opinion" (or " doxy") is ? How could his Lordship, prevented by common law from
</p>
<p>enquiring into heresy as respects the Scotch, the Irish, the Protestant, &c., determine
</p>
<p>the imputation " heterodox" in this case ? He (Mr. Anstey) submitted that on the face of the
</p>
<p>plaint, it seemed that it was a mere matter of discipline that there was no malice on part
</p>
<p>of the defendants, who were merely actuated by a motive to perform a public duty.
</p>
<p>Those inuendoes were not justified by the language of the libel. In support of this
</p>
<p>statement the learned counsel cited at length the cases of Ilem vs. , Solomon vs.
</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p>Laicson, Goldstein vs. Hurst, and Clement vs. Fisher. The only libel tangible can be
</p>
<p>divided into two heads, the one imputing the orthodoxy of the doctrines of the sect of
</p>
<p>Maharajas, and the other denouncing their immoral practices. The plaintiff' alleges that
</p>
<p>these imputations have brought him into contempt, but he does not say in what manner.
</p>
<p>These inuendoes have no meaning at all. Mr, Anstey urged that the utmost indulgence
</p>
<p>and license should be accorded to a fair criticism, and that the alleged libel was a fair
</p>
<p>and a liberal criticism of a book written some years ago by one Goculnathjee Maharaj,
</p>
<p>and of a commentary written thereon by the plaintiff" himself. There was not a single
</p>
<p>Protestant or a Eoman Catholic journal which would not be made the subject of an
</p>
<p>action at the instance of the other for imputing heresy to each other, if it be allowed
</p>
<p>that the so-called heresy is a libel. The alleged libel was a legitimate denunciation of
</p>
<p>a faith not partaken of by the writer for the purpose of protecting the innocent from
</p>
<p>being led into a path of immorality and wickedness. Every Protestant writes a polemic
</p>
<p>against the Catholic, and every Catholic against the Protestant, and they will do so
</p>
<p>until the end of time, and yet neither of them shall be lawfully chargeable with libel.
</p>
<p>That book of Judanathjee called the " Propagator" ought to have been mentioned in the
</p>
<p>plaint. When preceptors of religion neglect their duty they become unfit for their post,
</p>
<p>and hable to criticism, which could not be construed into a libel. If these inuendoes
</p>
<p>be construed as libel, then St. John must be held liable for that offence when he said,
</p>
<p>" Come ye out of her, &c." There was one ground of demurrer which Mr. Anstey
</p>
<p>insisted upon, which was that the translation of the article contained in the plaint was
</p>
<p>improper, and not an official translation. In conclusion Mr. Anstey urged that the Court
</p>
<p>ought not, on ground of pubUc policy, to interfere in religious matters of the Hindus,
</p>
<p>and submitted that the demurrer ought to be allowed.

</p>
<p>of the same meeting-house.
</p>
<p>" The information and bill were filed at the relation of George Lawson, who was
</p>
<p>one of three surviving trustees ;  (of whom the two defendants, Wilkinson and Monk,
</p>
<p>were the others), alleging various acts of misconduct on the part of the three defendants,
</p>
<p>particularly in making use of the meeting-house as a debating room for political pur-
</p>
<p>poses, allowing their adherents to express their opinions of the preacher, by applause,
</p>
<p>during the serivice, conversing loudly, and even smoking, during the same time, and,
</p>
<p>particularly (with regard to McPhail) that he had of late preached Chartist doctrines,
</p>
<p>and had denied one of the most material religious doctrines held by the congregation,
</p>
<p>namely, the eternity of future punishment for sin.
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>" Mr. Roll read several affidavits, in which it was sworn, that McPhail, had on one
</p>
<p>occasion, called on such members of the congregation present, as were of Chartist opinions,
</p>
<p>to hold up their hands, for the excommunication of such members, as were not Chartists ; 
</p>
<p>that he had admitted to the deponents that he did not believe in eternal future
</p>
<p>punishment ; that McPhail had been in the meeting-house, in the pulpit, smoking,
</p>
<p>while there were, in the body of the building, large numbers of colliers, wearing their
</p>
<p>hats or caps, and smoking short black pipes, and all this on a Suuday, when Divine
</p>
<p>service ought to have been performed ; and that McPhail had read extracts, (and
</p>
<p>commented on them,) from the Morning Star, and from Eichardson's Black Book, during
</p>
<p>his sermons, and advocated therein Chartist doctrines.
</p>
<p>" His Honor observed the deed of trust required that the minister of the meeting-
</p>
<p>house should believe in the doctrine of eternal punishment in a future state for sin
</p>
<p>committed in this. He said he did not see, as matters stood, and on an interlocutory
</p>
<p>proceeding, and as the information did not pray anything in the nature of a receiver
</p>
<p>or manager, that he could make the order as to "Wilkinson and Monk. He had no
</p>
<p>means of judging, what, according to the peculiar doctrines and habits of their sect,
</p>
<p>amounted to indecency or scandal, whether smoking, or reading a newspaper, in the
</p>
<p>pulpit or meeting-house was so. What might be indecent, or scandalous in the Catholic
</p>
<p>Church, might be viewed in a very different light, by many sects ; and this His Honor
</p>
<p>said, with all respect to the congregation now in question. On the point of doctrine,
</p>
<p>as regarded McPhail, the case seemed tolerably clear ; without saying what he might
</p>
<p>do, on another application, and an amended record, he thought, it would not be safe,
</p>
<p>under present circumstances, to act against the two gentlemen, Wilkinson and Monk.
</p>
<p>His Honor was not satisfied that there was a case, in which, looking at the whole
</p>
<p>evidence, it would be right to act against McPhail, except on the point of doctrine.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Russell, having addressed the Court on that point, asserted that, if Mr. McPhail
</p>
<p>did not believe in the doctrine of eternal future punishment, he had forsworn himself. . . .
</p>
<p>He swore, " that it is not true that he does not believe," and that was equivalent,
</p>
<p>for all purposes, (and particularly when uttered by a man, under, in fact, a charge
</p>
<p>of perjury,) to his saying " he does believe " so and so . . .
</p>
<p>" His Honor said, that he expressed neither approbation nor disapprobation, in a
</p>
<p>religious or moral point of view, of what had been said on either side. The case on
</p>
<p>the bill, answer and affidavit, as to the trustees, was not, with sufficient plainness,
</p>
<p>established to warrant the Court in making an order as to them. It was, however,

</p>
<p>otherwise as to the minister. If there were an officiating minister, holding doctrines,
</p>
<p>not in conformity with the provisions of the deed, it would be a plain and manifest
</p>
<p>breach of trust. . . Comparing the general with the particular charges, coming from
</p>
<p>such a quarter as they did. His Honor, upon the evidence before him, felt bound to
</p>
<p>come to the conclusion, that, on the point he had last adverted to, the minister did
</p>
<p>not hold the doctrine that the deed of trust required. His Honor felt, that, so far
</p>
<p>as the minister was concerned, he was bound to grant the injunction."

<p>Second Bay, Thnrsday, ^ih Jul// 1861.
</p>
<p>Mr. Baijieij, with whom was Mr. Scoble, stated that he appeared to argue the
</p>
<p>case on behalf of the plaintiff, and that he was taken by surprise at the great
</p>
<p>quantity of irrelevant argument addressed to the Court by his learned friend, Mr.
</p>
<p>Anstey, and in answer to a sentence to which he gave utterance, he would merely
</p>
<p>say that as this was a demurrer not on any matters of substance, but purely of form,
</p>
<p>the rule has been violated, and the Court could not allow any of those eleven points
</p>
<p>without overturning the rule which has been in vogue for centuries in England and
</p>
<p>here for many years. The learned Couusel would address a few observations to shew
</p>
<p>his learned friend had no locus standi and no right to go into general demurrer and
</p>
<p>the cases cited thereon. Where a party files a special demurrer he is bound to it, and
</p>
<p>therefore could not, and has no right whatever to argue poinsts on general demurrer.
</p>
<p>As to this point he referred to what is invariably relied on by lawyers,  Comyn's
</p>
<p>Digest and Stephen's Pleading, in which it is laid down that in special demurrer a
</p>
<p>party waives all points, and adheres to the particular points specified. The cases cited
</p>
<p>by his learned friend under the title of inuendo were not applicable here by the laws
</p>
<p>of pleading, and every point taken by him in that respect was frivolous. The EngUsh
</p>
<p>Common Law Procedure Act, vvhich was passed in 1852, and had not been introduced
</p>
<p>here, merely restored the simpHcity of old pleadings, brushed away the superfluous
</p>
<p>growth of technicalities and abolished special demurrers. He would refer to the language
</p>
<p>of the clause by which the modes of procedure in Common Law are pointed in the
</p>
<p>Charters of the Supreme Courts in India, and from that he would be justified in
</p>
<p>saying that special demurrers are not allowed.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice.  Mr. Bayley, you need not trouble yourself about that. It has
</p>
<p>been the practice here for a long time to take special demurrers, but the Court
</p>
<p>discountenances them by not allowing costs. It will be useless your arguing the point,
</p>
<p>for I am not going to change that rule of the Court.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley, however, would still say that the English technical points are not
</p>
<p>incorporated here by the Charter. In the case of the Queen vs. Alloo Paroo, reported
</p>
<p>in Sir Erskine Perry's Oriental Cases, p. 551, the Chief Justice decided that
</p>
<p>the technicalities ot English law and pleading are not to be applied to India ; and the
</p>
<p>point to be decided here was not merely what the law here was,  but what would
</p>
<p>ultimately be decided in the Privy Council. Mr. Bayley 's contention, of course, was
</p>
<p>that the plaint was sufficient, for there was no such thing as a declaration in the

</p>
<p>procedure here, and the learned counsel called the attention of the Court to what was
</p>
<p>a plaint (reading the definition of " Plaint," from Comyn's Digest, and Wharton's Law
</p>
<p>Lexicon, Edition of 1860). The mode of procedure at common law adopted here was
</p>
<p>analogous to that in the English County Courts, but in the latter the technical system of
</p>
<p>special demurrers does not exist. The matter to be discussed was whether the plaint
</p>
<p>contained the cause of action, and he ventured to assert that it was sufficient. His
</p>
<p>learned friend was tied down to the points mentioned in the special demurrer, and he
</p>
<p>could not therefore digress from them, and attack the plaint in substance. His argu-
</p>
<p>ment had branched out into a point whether certain parts of the plaint were or were
</p>
<p>not contrary to public policy. If a man demurs specially, be waives all points and is
</p>
<p>tied down to the special ones, and Mr. Bayley had shown by authorities that his
</p>
<p>13
</p>
<p>learned friend had no rlglit to argue general points, they not having been set down
</p>
<p>on the margin. In Parker vs. Reilb/, 3 M. & W., the Court expressed an opinion
</p>
<p>that a party could not go beyond the points mentioned in the margin, and in Arbowin
</p>
<p>vs. Anderson, 1 Q. B. Reports, it was decided that the paper books must state the
</p>
<p>points intended to be made on each side, and that counsel could not go out of them.
</p>
<p>That had not been done so in this case. Therefore on both these grounds, the
</p>
<p>defendant was not entitled to go into the question of public policy, and he could not
</p>
<p>be heard. This Court cannot, nor can any Court travel one inch beyond what has been
</p>
<p>laid down in the demurrer book. Turning to another part of the argument, he (Mr.
</p>
<p>Bayley) said that having admitted all the facts of the plaint, his learned friend could
</p>
<p>not argue that the translation of the article was incorrect.
</p>
<p>Cliipf Justice.  But suppose there is a repugnancy between the translation and the
</p>
<p>original document, how is the Court to come at that f One of the rules of the Court is
</p>
<p>to recognise only the official translation. Suppose the original Guzeratee document differs
</p>
<p>from the translation of it, and if one of the grounds of the demurrer is that there is
</p>
<p>that difference, then the defendant cannot admit such translation.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley said it was not necessary to set out the translation or copy of a
</p>
<p>document, although the original must be set out {Zenobio vs. Aktell 6 T. R.), (Craft
</p>
<p>vs. Boyd, 1 Wi7is. Saunders.) The rule of this Court as regards official translations
</p>
<p>alluded to by his learned friend was a fallacy ; as the rule only said that no document
</p>
<p>shall be given in evidence without a translation signed by the Chief Translator, which
</p>
<p>had been done here, as the translation in the plaint was made and signed by Mr.
</p>
<p>Flynn, the Chief Translator, and the language of the plaint was " which being
</p>
<p>correctly translated," and the demurrer admitted that.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice.  That may be good law in England, but it would not apply here,
</p>
<p>where the practice has been to have documents translated. Surely that document must
</p>
<p>be read in Court, which cannot be done without its being translated.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley observed that it was not open to his learned friend to take that objection
</p>
<p>at that stage, it was quite premature ; he now sought to traverse the point, and
</p>
<p>therefore he could not demur at the same time. The rule of pleadings in force in
</p>
<p>Bombay did not justify his learned friend to traverse and demur at the same time.
</p>
<p>The learned counsel next called the attention of the Court to what the action was
</p>
<p>for, viz., that it was for libel. The demurrer admitted the whole of the plaint, the
</p>
<p>introductory averments respecting the plaintiff and the peculiar sanctity in which as a

</p>
<p>Maharaj he was held by Brahmins and others,  the publication of the libel, that the
</p>
<p>publication was a false, scandalous, defamatory and infamous libel, the special damage,
</p>
<p>&c. His learned friend, however, argued that it was not a libel, but Mr. Bayley
</p>
<p>contended that it was, to determine which he read the definition of Libel in Wrongs
</p>
<p>and Remedies by Addison, p. 576. One of the eleven points of the demurrer was
</p>
<p>that the plaint did not impute any specific offence, but that was a frivolous objection,
</p>
<p>for an action of libel can lie, and the libeller is punishable for slandering another m
</p>
<p>his protession. After admitting on the face of the demurrer that the libel was
</p>
<p>published, and that it was false, scandalous &c., it was idle and frivolous for the
</p>
<p>defendant to rebut it, and say that it contained no offence. Mr. Bayley then said he
</p>
<p>had no desire to shrink from answering the objections raised on the ground of public
</p>
<p>policy, if the Court deemed it was necessary for him to do so.
</p>
<p>14
</p>
<p>Chief Justice.  I have simply the plaint in libel and the demurrer that the
</p>
<p>plaint is informally treated. I do not know how the question of public policy comes
</p>
<p>before me in this demurrer.
</p>
<p>3fr. Bayley.  I understand your Lordship does not ask me to answer the points
</p>
<p>raised on ground of public policy.
</p>
<p>Cliief Justice.  So far as the grounds of special demurrer embrace those points, I
</p>
<p>am bound to give consideration to them, but I am not bound to entertain the question
</p>
<p>of public policy in a separate form. If Mr. Anstey had shewn any authority 1 would
</p>
<p>have been bound to hear it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Baijley then being relieved of so much argument, proceeded to remark in
</p>
<p>answer to an ojection, that however obscene and disagreeable might be the character
</p>
<p>of tlie evidence which would be brought forward at the trial, there was nothing ta
</p>
<p>prevent the Court from hearing the action. He referred to the case of Sudasundseii
</p>
<p>vs. hoknath Mulh/, Morton's Cases, decided in the Supreme Court at Calcutta, which was
</p>
<p>an action of crim. con. between two Hindoo parties, and the Court held that the
</p>
<p>action was sustainable ; and in the case of Queen vs. Dr. l^ewman, 1 Vol. Dearsly's
</p>
<p>Crown Cases, there were twenty-two charges of libel brought against Dr. AchilH by
</p>
<p>Dr. Newman ; one of the pleas was justification of every fact stated in the libel and though
</p>
<p>the circumstances of the case were of a most indecent character, it did not prevent the
</p>
<p>criminal information from being brought to trial, and the defendant was fined 100.
</p>
<p>Now what was the libel here ? The chief part of it charged the plaintiff and his
</p>
<p>brother Maharajas with being in the habit of defiling the wives and daughters of their
</p>
<p>devotees. Looking at the improper character of the evidence which will come out,
</p>
<p>said Mr. Bayley, Dr. Newman's case is a precedent that such obscene cases can be
</p>
<p>heard. Keferring to the first ground of objection in the demurrer, Mr. Bayley said, it
</p>
<p>was unnecessary to state more than this, that the plaintiff has a cause of action. It
</p>
<p>was said that the doctrines of the Hindu Keligion should have been set out. In actions
</p>
<p>professedly grounded on custom it is not usual to set out what the custom is. (Wentworth
</p>
<p>on Pleading, Edition of 1797, 1 Vol., p. 230). Bill of Exchange and Marine Policies
</p>
<p>derive their origin from the custom of merchants, and no custom used ever to be set
</p>
<p>out in declarations in such actions. In an action founded upon a custom of bankers,
</p>
<p>it has been held not necessary to set out the custom. Bellamy m. Marjoribanks, 6 Exc.
</p>
<p>Supposing we were setting out a libel by setting out the doctrines of Christianity, how could
</p>
<p>that be done ? No two persons can agree as to what those doctrines are ; it is impossible

</p>
<p>to state them ; who is say what the doctrines of Christian religion are ? They are
</p>
<p>different in Rome, Geneva, England and Scotland. With the Hindoo religion the
</p>
<p>difficulty increases a hundredfold. Supposing that the doctrines ought to be set out, how
</p>
<p>was that to be done with a religion which is so mysterious, which is older by centuries
</p>
<p>than the Christian Eeligion, and has so many ramifications ; and how could an
</p>
<p>unfortunate barrister, whether an old practitioner here or a new arrival, set out what the
</p>
<p>Hindu religion is. None but Brahmins study it, and some thirty years are required
</p>
<p>for that purpose. The learned counsel would show that, according to the strict rules
</p>
<p>of law, it was not necessary to set out such matters in the plaint. He cited cases
</p>
<p>from Stephens on Pleadim/ and passages from Comyn's Digest, shewing that it is not
</p>
<p>necessary to state what the law presumes. Irrespective of this, the learned counsel
</p>
<p>contended that the libel can be understood without the setting out of the doctrines, inasmuch
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>as it charged the phiiiitiff with breaches of the moral law. The numerous cases cited by his
</p>
<p>learned friend to impeach the plaint of introductory averments, gave the Court but little
</p>
<p>assistance, and did not support the argument to the desired extent. The arguments
</p>
<p>founded upon by the other side upon the case of Solomon vs. Wright, are cut away
</p>
<p>by the case of" Lofann vs. Malcolmson, in the House of Lords two years afterwards,
</p>
<p>wherein it is decided that though defamatory matter apply to a class, if the inuendo
</p>
<p>point to a particular person, that person can bring an action for libel. In the pre-
</p>
<p>sent case the libel unquestionably points to the class of Maharajas, and if the plaintiff
</p>
<p>satisfactorily shews that he was one of them, and that it applied to him, he can
</p>
<p>bring an action. The case of Goldstein vs. Fox and other cases cited by Mr. Anstey,
</p>
<p>are those of oral defamation or slander, and did not apply to a case of libel. The
</p>
<p>argument that the plaintiff and his sect have no locus standi, and that they are not
</p>
<p>entitled to the protection at law, seemed to Mr. Bayley to be a strange conception of
</p>
<p>the law administered in this country.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice.  The 3 and 4 William IV. puts that to rest, for there is a clause
</p>
<p>there which bestows upon the people here equal rights.
</p>
<p>3fr. Bajjleij then went on to argue the objection that the plaintiff must be
</p>
<p>treated as an alien. He said that if any persons were to be treated as aliens, it
</p>
<p>must be he himself and his learned friend as foreigners in this land, and not the
</p>
<p>plaintiff, descended from the original inhabitants of India, who describes himself to be
</p>
<p>a liege subject of Her Majesty the Queen, and a resident in Bombay for a number
</p>
<p>of years. To shew how Her Majesty's Courts lend their assistance to foreigners, he
</p>
<p>cited the well known case of the Emperor of Austria vs. Louis Kossuth, decided in
</p>
<p>May last, reported 7 Jurist N. S. by V. C. Stuart and also K. vs. Peltier, where
</p>
<p>the libel was on Napoleon Buonaparte when First Consul, and E. vs. Lord George
</p>
<p>Gordon for a libel on the Queen of Spain. It had been urged that the denunciation
</p>
<p>of the conduct of the Maharajas, who under the cloak of religion, defiled the wives
</p>
<p>and daughters of their devotees, was not a libel. In answer to this, he (Mr.
</p>
<p>Bayley) need only say that the plaint spoke for itself, and that the argument was too
</p>
<p>premature, and not worthy the consideration of the Court at this stage of the proceed-
</p>
<p>ings, and he cited the case of Thorley vs. The Earl of Kerri/, 4 Taunton, where the
</p>
<p>introductory averments were similar to the present case, and where the Earl had been
</p>
<p>charged with practising hypocrisy under the cloak of religion and that was held by the
</p>
<p>Courts of Queen's Bench and Common Pleas to be a libel. Again it had been

</p>
<p>argued that there was no allegation in the plaint,  that abstinence from women was
</p>
<p>the profession of the Maharaj ; but the learned counsel deemed it unnecessary to notice
</p>
<p>such a monstrous argument, which bore absurdity on the face of it, for abstinence
</p>
<p>from women is no man's profession, and much less in a climate like this, where the
</p>
<p>passions are warm, where children arrive at puberty at a much earlier age than in
</p>
<p>the cold countries, and are by Hindu law of age at IG. Again it was said that it
</p>
<p>was free to all people to cast imputation upon people in illegal profession and obnoxi-
</p>
<p>ous to law ; but he contended that the plaintiff has been in enjoyment of a legal
</p>
<p>profession, and the argument therefore bears contradiction on the face of it. There
</p>
<p>was no authority for Mr. Anstey saying that during the period the English have
</p>
<p>been in possession of Bombay there has been no case of this sort on record, for
</p>
<p>Morley's Digest bears evidence of many cases of actions of libel brought in the Zilia
</p>
<p>16
</p>
<p>vSudder Courts. Even supposing that there are no precedents, that does not preclude
</p>
<p>plaintiff seeking redress for a grievance on the established principle of law, that where
</p>
<p>there is a wrong there is a remedy. AsJdet/ vs. White ; Embrey vs. Owen 7 Exe.
</p>
<p>Another argument was that the law of defamation in spiritual cases has not been
</p>
<p>granted to the Natives here, but (Mr. Bayley contended) this was a libel against the
</p>
<p>plaintiff, not in his spiritual capacity, but in his private character, and the mere fact
</p>
<p>of his being a Brahmin, a Maharaj, or a member of the sect of Wallabcharya, did not
</p>
<p>disentitle him to seek protection at law. If such a doctrine were allowed, no Brahmin
</p>
<p>in the land would be safe ; he could be slandered and libelled with impunity, and
</p>
<p>redress denied to him because he happened to be a spiritual person. The Institutes
</p>
<p>of Menu and other sacred books of the Hindus shew that a Brahmin was considered
</p>
<p>as a powerful Divinity. Another objection was that the words " improper conduct" are
</p>
<p>unknown to the English law ; but the learned counsel denied that to be so, for if a
</p>
<p>libel is libellous without an inuendo, it can be rejected (cited several authorities).
</p>
<p>Taking the whole article from beginning to end it 'was a libel upon the character
</p>
<p>of the plaintiff, and all that the Court had to do, was to determine whether the
</p>
<p>special points were allowable. It had been complained that no specific offence was
</p>
<p>attributed to the defendants, but Mr. Bayley urged that it was not necessary to lay a
</p>
<p>specific charge. The case of the Quakers, alluded to by his learned friend with regard
</p>
<p>to the discipline of the sect, was not applicable to this. The other complaint was
</p>
<p>that there was no allegation of malice, but he answered that that was unnecessary as
</p>
<p>malice is implied in the libel. It was said that the latter part of the article was only-
</p>
<p>tangible as libel, but he would say that the whole of the article from beginning to
</p>
<p>end was so. It was not necessary to state how the plaintiff was disgraced by the
</p>
<p>libel. This was an article in a newspaper, and it was only necessary to set out the
</p>
<p>whole of the article, if as in this case the article was complete in itself. As to the-
</p>
<p>translation being not official, he said it was quite correct, and bore the signature of
</p>
<p>the head translator of the Court. As to the clerical errors, the learned counsel was-
</p>
<p>not satisfied that there were any such errors in the copy of the plaint, although:
</p>
<p>there might be some slight errors which inevitably occur in copies written by native
</p>
<p>clerks imperfectly acquainted with the English language, and not a single certified copy
</p>
<p>that issued from the offices of the Master and Prothonotary that he had seen, had been
</p>
<p>free from them. If the argument were allowed, the omission of a dot to an"i"or a
</p>
<p>cross to a single " t " would be fatal. On the whole he submitffed that the demurrer was

</p>
<p>frivolous, and should be dismissed with costs.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anste'j, in reply, said he bowed to the decision of his Lordship overruling his
</p>
<p>objection raised on the ground of public policy, and therefore confined his observations
</p>
<p>to the points of special demurrer. Before entering upon the arguments of his learned
</p>
<p>friend, he read the clause of the 3 and 4 William IV., to show that his Lordship was
</p>
<p>right in principle, though the modus operandi was different. He then proceeded to say
</p>
<p>on authority, that without a good inducement the inuendo is nothing, and that his
</p>
<p>arguments had turned not upon the formal passages in the plaint, but upon material
</p>
<p>passages. Erom the plaint it did not' appear in what way the defendants were guilty
</p>
<p>of the alleged offence, and which of the two defendants, on record. It was material to
</p>
<p>know which of them committed the alleged grievance, because one was a Parsee and
</p>
<p>the other a Hindu, and the former might claim more freedom of criticism than the
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>latter would, and sice -versa. It was not stated in what their offence consisted, and
</p>
<p>here was nothing specifically charged. He illustrated his argument by the suppositious
</p>
<p>case of a Christian bringing an action against another Christian, in wliich case the
</p>
<p>Court would take it as matters affecting the Christian religion. The morality of the
</p>
<p>West is known to the law, while that of the East is left very vague, and therefore it
</p>
<p>is necessary that the imputations on the moral character of the people of the latter
</p>
<p>must be specified. If the doctrine that no such specification was required was adopted,
</p>
<p>there would be no end to the inconvenience and difficulty in which the Court would
</p>
<p>be thereby involved, for in the eyes of the Maharaj the defendants might be guilty of
</p>
<p>blasphemy in taking his godly name in vain in such a manner. It has been urged
</p>
<p>that it is not necessary to allege a custom in pleading, but Mr. Anstey contended that
</p>
<p>where parties sue on a case involving custom, that custom must be alleged, though it
</p>
<p>might not be set out at length. The plaintiff ought to have stated that chastity is a
</p>
<p>virture according to the tenets of his sect. The argument that it would be difficult
</p>
<p>and not safe for a pleader to set out the doctrine in case of a Christian clergyman,
</p>
<p>or ground that no Christians agree on it, applied, said Mr. Anstey, with reversed force
</p>
<p>to the case of Hindus, where from their religion, or rather many religions, it was
</p>
<p>necessary that there should be averments of the doctrine. The Court is not the proper
</p>
<p>tribunal to determine a suit where a self-styled god or Maharaj seeks to enforce the
</p>
<p>discipline of his sect. He never denied the difference between a written and an oral
</p>
<p>slander as to the liability of the slanderer, but what he said was that both written
</p>
<p>and unwritten defamation agree in this  if it has been uttered or published concerning
</p>
<p>a man in his profession, then it becomes necessary for him by clear averment to connect
</p>
<p>that slander not only with the special damages, but with the conduct of his profession.
</p>
<p>The Maharaj had chosen to declare that he had been slandered in his profession, but
</p>
<p>he ought to have shewn the connection between the imputation and the profession, and
</p>
<p>that he was liable to a censure from his superiors. Suppose the Court was sitting in
</p>
<p>Madras to try an action of crim. con. among the Nairs, a sect on the Malabar Coast,
</p>
<p>where the custom prevails of two or three brothers having one wife in common, would
</p>
<p>it not be necessary for the Court then to enquire what religion the parties belonged
</p>
<p>to, and, under an Act of Parliament, to respect their usages. This Court could not
</p>
<p>entertain an action for crim. con. where the parties are Hindus, because by the Hindu law the
</p>
<p>offence is made subject to a criminal jurisdiction. The very book  Morley's Digest  alluded to
</p>
<p>on the other side, is full of cases in which the Zilla Courts have refused to entertain

</p>
<p>questions of caste and those partaking of a spiritual character. It was urged that the
</p>
<p>malice must be presumed, but he (Mr. Anstey) said there was nothing in the alleged
</p>
<p>libel to warrant the Court in presuming malice. The alleged hbel amounted merely to
</p>
<p>this. A book has been published since many years by one Goculnathjee Maharaj
</p>
<p>promulgating a doctrine, the plaintiff followed suit, and, in commenting on the doctrine,
</p>
<p>the defendants used terms of reproach within the bounds of legitimate criticism. In
</p>
<p>reviewing these books, the defendants denounced their doctrines, that is the true con-
</p>
<p>struction of the alleged libel, and Mr. Anstey said this was no libel. The whole of
</p>
<p>the matter in the hbel is speculative, with the exception of a tangible point which
</p>
<p>might be observed from looking to the inuendo. It may be divided into two parts,
</p>
<p>one impugning the orthodoxy of the doctrines of the sect, and the other impugning their
</p>
<p>offensive and immoral practices, and the learned counsel contended that it was a fair
</p>
<p>and legitimate criticism of the sect. The criticism referred to a historical fact, viz., the history
</p>
<p>18
</p>
<p>of the Hindu religion from the 1 6th century, and to the philosophy of the doctrines of a sect, and
</p>
<p>on the authority of opinions expressed by Lord EUinborough and Lord Campbell, the
</p>
<p>learned counsel maintained that such criticism could not be held a libel. He believed
</p>
<p>that his case was not in the least affected by the arguments of his learned friend, and
</p>
<p>he fully relied on the eleven grounds of the demurrer.
</p>
<p>Thursdai/, \Wi July 1861.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice this day delivered his judgment to the following effect :  -It
</p>
<p>was open to the defendant under the Statute to raise any question of general demurrer
</p>
<p>besides those specified, but by the Court's rule No. 90 he is confined to such special
</p>
<p>grounds as are stated. The defendant was limited to the eleven grounds of special
</p>
<p>demurrer exhibited by him, and it was with these alone the Court had now to deal.
</p>
<p>By the rules of pleading irrelevant matter might be rejected and cannot be made
</p>
<p>ground of special demurrer. The principle Utile per inutile non vitiatur was applicable
</p>
<p>to all those grounds of demurrer.
</p>
<p>Now as to the first ground of the special demurrer, which is that there was no
</p>
<p>allegation that improper conduct is contrary to the doctrines of Vallabhacharya, &c., his
</p>
<p>Lordship said that this portion of the plaint containing the averment of character was
</p>
<p>clearly to he held mere surplusage by Chitty (Vol. 2.) from whom the precedent is
</p>
<p>evidently taken (Styles 11 Precedent 1. M.S.), so the words "By means whereof," &c.
</p>
<p>were shewn to be not traversable according to the authorities in the same book. No special
</p>
<p>demurrer could therefore lie on this ground, and consequently in His Lordship's opinion
</p>
<p>the first ground failed. His Lordship would not hold it necessary for plaintiff to make
</p>
<p>the averments which the special demurrer insisted he ought to have made, for what is
</p>
<p>meant by " heterodoxy" appears from the libel itself where that word occurs and where
</p>
<p>it also, in His Lordship's opinion, sufficiently indicates what it relates to. It is clearly
</p>
<p>stated there that certain sects are heterodox by the Hindu Shastras or sacred books,
</p>
<p>and it is admitted that plaintiff is one of that sect. On that ground alone Hia
</p>
<p>Lordship would not allow this point of the special demurrer. This was made abun-
</p>
<p>dantly clear by the libel which goes on very much to identify the " heterodoxy" with
</p>
<p>" heresy."
</p>
<p>The second ground of the demurrer that there was no allegation that improper
</p>
<p>conduct was contrary to the religion of the sect, &c., must be overruled on the same
</p>
<p>principle. A great deal was said and it was very much insisted on that this was a
</p>
<p>libel against the Maharaj as a high priest alone. Now that was a mistake. Looking

</p>
<p>to the libel itself it is charged against the plaintiff, as a Maharaj, as a Brahmin and
</p>
<p>s a member of the said sect of Vallabhacharya. The case of May vs. Brown, 3 B.
</p>
<p>19
</p>
<p>&nd C. 138, is a 'direct authority to shew that when a libel is of and concerning
</p>
<p>the plaintiff in various characters, it is a libel against him individually, so that it
</p>
<p>appeared to the Court, this was a libel against the plaintiff in his individual capacitj'-,
</p>
<p>segregated from his character of priest. (Levsis vs. Walter 3 B. and C. in notes to
</p>
<p>May vs. Brown?) If the Court were to hold the plaintiff bound to make such an
</p>
<p>averment as was here demanded, that would be to hold him prima facie guilty of the
</p>
<p>conduct imputed to him. A Hindu is not more bound to do so than an European.
</p>
<p>This Court is bound to treat both upon an equality and to administer the same law
</p>
<p>to every one. This Court has no judicial cognisance of any peculiarities of moral
</p>
<p>conduct if there are such, but must leave the defendant to come in and allege them
</p>
<p>in his ovm defence by way of plea. The plaintiff is not bound to anticipate what is
</p>
<p>merely matter of defence.
</p>
<p>As to the third cause of the demurrer the same rule applied which his Lordship
</p>
<p>had applied to the first two. Also this usage was sufficiently pleaded for the purpose
</p>
<p>of the inducement where the same strictness is not required as in the rest of the plaint.
</p>
<p>For the same reasons his Lordship overruled the fourth cause of the demurrer which
</p>
<p>stated that there was no allegation that it was contrary to the practice of the Maharajas
</p>
<p>to enjoy the tender maidens, wives, and daughters of their devotees. His Lordship did
</p>
<p>not think that the plaintiff was bound to exculpate himself from these imputations.
</p>
<p>The fifth ground, which alleged that no specific offence was charged, arose in this
</p>
<p>way. There are two defendants named in the plaint ; yet throughout, the word " defendant"
</p>
<p>in the singular number was used. There was a rule no doubt that accuracy must be
</p>
<p>observed, and a case in point (Walford vs. Anthony, 8 Bingh.) was adduced by Mr.
</p>
<p>Anstey. His Lordship was reluctantly obliged to allow that cause of demurrer ; it was,
</p>
<p>however a small point.
</p>
<p>As to the sixth cause of the demurrer, the observations his Lordship had already made,
</p>
<p>applied to it and it must be overruled. The " heterodox opinions" are sufficiently defined
</p>
<p>by the libel and so also the words " offences and improper conduct," because these are
</p>
<p>levelled at certain specific acts charged to have been done by the plaintiff.
</p>
<p>The seventh cause which complained of certain expressions being insensible and
</p>
<p>ambiguous, was also overruled, as the expressions clearly appeared in the libel.
</p>
<p>The eighth cause stated that the several inuendoes alleging that the plaint/ff and
</p>
<p>other Maharajas are guilty of rascality and shameful conduct, and defile the wives and
</p>
<p>daughters of their devotees and other Hindus by criminal intercourse with them, &c.,

</p>
<p>are not warranted by the words of the libel, nor supported by any inducement or
</p>
<p>introductory averment to which the inuendoes refer. This cause, his Lordship said,
</p>
<p>forced on the Court the consideration of what the libel itsel was. His Lordship was
</p>
<p>of opinion that the learned Counsel (Mr. Anstey) for the defendants had very
</p>
<p>properly divided the libel into opinions and facts. Now, if on looking to this part of
</p>
<p>the libel the Court found any one of the inuendoes not supported by the Hbel, it would
</p>
<p>be the duty of the Court to allow the demurrer as to that. His Lordship had
</p>
<p>atttentively gone through them all and must say that it did appear to him that the
</p>
<p>first part of the article was an attempt to argue upon historical facts brought to
</p>
<p>bear upon the opinions of a particular class of people at the present day. It is law-
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>ful for any person to take up the history or the historical opinions of any sect or
</p>
<p>class, and to reason upon them, and if he fairly and honestly produces opinions not
</p>
<p>in unison with what others would form, yet if there be no malice he would not be
</p>
<p>guilty of libel. Now thus far it appeared to his Lordship that the libel was levelled
</p>
<p>against this sect,  its opinions,  and the writings of its members. The reasoning and
</p>
<p>logic might not be perfect, but so far there was nothing to shew personal mahce
</p>
<p>against the plaintiff. (Reading a portion of the article) His Lordship remarked that
</p>
<p>that was arguing in a historical point of view,  a comparison of the ancient Hindu
</p>
<p>religion with the new. The words were coarse and vulgar, but his Lordship was not
</p>
<p>prepared to say that they were libellous as against the plaintiff. His Lordship after
</p>
<p>alluding to the case of Lefanu vs. Malcolmso7i cited by the plaintiff's counsel, said he
</p>
<p>knew of no authority for holding that any one sect of hundreds, thousands, or millions
</p>
<p>of people accused (because of their members) of subtlety, immorality, rascality, immodesty,
</p>
<p>&c., has a right to bring his action on that ground as for a libel on himself. The rest of the
</p>
<p>libel, his Lordship observed, was of a diflterent character. In it the plaintiff was singled
</p>
<p>out and apostrophised, and was charged with acts alleged to be committed by himself.
</p>
<p>(Reading the last portion of the article). That, it appeared to his Lordship, was a
</p>
<p>direct charge against the existing body of Maharajas, it points out the plaintiff as
</p>
<p>one of them, and it tells him to desist. The two grounds charged here as hbellous
</p>
<p>come within the case of Tabail vs. Tepper before Lord Ellenborough, which was cited
</p>
<p>in argument. Again in Carr vs. Mood that Chief Justice held the same doctrine.
</p>
<p>This after part of the libel, however. His Lordship said, would come before the Court
</p>
<p>on future occasion, and he would therefore express no further opinion on it now.
</p>
<p>Then there was another inuendo which relates to "as long as the preceptors of religion
</p>
<p>&c." but the Maharajas are not stated in the inducement to be " preceptors of religion."
</p>
<p>Therefore according to the rules of pleading, the plaintiff had no right to sustain this
</p>
<p>inuendo, and this cause of the demurrer. His Lordship said, must be allowed.
</p>
<p>As to the ninth ground of demurrer, it had been abandoned by Mr. Anstey,
</p>
<p>and His Lordship merely stated therefore that the learned counsel for the . plaintiff
</p>
<p>was wrong in saying that in England a translation is unnecessary (Zenobio vs. Axtill 6
</p>
<p>T. R.) It is a rule of common sense and of law.
</p>
<p>As to the tenth ground of the demurrer, if the clerical errors were considerable, the
</p>
<p>Court would not yield to them. But they did not appear considerable, and as some
</p>
<p>must occur in this country, the point taken must be overruled.

</p>
<p>^ As to the eleventh and last ground referring to omissions of books &c.. His Lordship
</p>
<p>thought it must be overruled. The office of a special demurrer is to point out to the
</p>
<p>plaintiff what amendment he should make in his pleading. Now this the defendant
</p>
<p>had not done, but his Lordship did not think that either of those books was at all
</p>
<p>necessary to be further set forth.
</p>
<p>The special demurrer was on the fifth and eight points allowed.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley.  As we have virtually succeeded we ought to have the costs.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice. 1 cannot allow that. There is no authority in favour of giving
</p>
<p>costs to a plaintiff of a demurrer allowed.
</p>
<p>21
</p>
<p>3f)\ Bayky asked leave to amend the plaint on the fifth and eighth points.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice.  The plaintiff will have liberty to amend, on amending defendant's
</p>
<p>copy.

<p>The Defendants to have a fortnight to plead.
</p>
<p>THE PLEAS SET FORTH BY THE DEFENDANTS.
</p>
<p>The defendants, by Samuel Lavvford Acland, their A.ttorney, say that they are not
</p>
<p>nor is either of them guilty of the said supposed grievances above laid to their charge
</p>
<p>or any or either of the same or any part thereof in manner and form as by the
</p>
<p>plaintiff above in that behalf alleged, and of this the defendants put themselves upon
</p>
<p>the Court, &c.
</p>
<p>And for a second plea in this behalf the defendants say that the persons in the
</p>
<p>said plaint alleged to be called Maharajas were not nor are the preceptors of the Hindu
</p>
<p>religion therein mentioned in manner and form as by the plaintiff above in that behalf
</p>
<p>alleged and of this the defendants put themselves upon the Court, &c.
</p>
<p>And for a third plea in this behalf the defendants say that the said persons were
</p>
<p>not nor are the chiefs or heads of the class of Hindus in the said plaint alleged to be
</p>
<p>called Brahmins in mannner and form as by the plaintiff above in that behalf alleged
</p>
<p>and of this the defendants put themselves upon the Court, &c.
</p>
<p>And for a fourth plea in this behalf to the said plaint the defendants say that
</p>
<p>the plaintiff hath noc always been nor is a Hindu High Priest of high caste or a
</p>
<p>preceptor of the Hindu religion in manner and form as by the plaintiff above in that
</p>
<p>behalf alleged and of this the defendants put themselves upon the Court, &c.
</p>
<p>And for a fifth plea in this behalf the defendants say that the supposed religious
</p>
<p>sect by the said plaint alleged to be called the sect of Vallabacharya or the sect of the
</p>
<p>Maharajas, and of which sect the plaintiff is by the same plaint alleged to be a member
</p>
<p>is a sect of persons holding professing and observing religious opinions and practices of
</p>
<p>a very modern date to wit of the date of the 15th century of the Christian Era, and
</p>
<p>altogether repugnant to and at variance with the religious doctrines and practices of the
</p>
<p>ancient Hindu religion in the introductory part of the said plaint mentioned, and the
</p>
<p>usage custom and practice therein also mentioned, without this that the plaintiff is a
</p>
<p>member of an ancient Hindu religious sect in manner and form as by him the plaintiff
</p>
<p>above in that behalf alleged and of this the defendants put themselves upon the
</p>
<p>Court, &c.
</p>
<p>And for a sixth plea in this behalf the defendants say that so much of the

<p>alleged libel as is next hereinafter set forth in the Gujerati language and character

</p>
<p>that is to say ^ [^A >i^>il^ >ll^Rl^l ^\i{\^ ^Idl'll mhr{[ H^ ^i;^^l'^

<p>being literally and accurately translated into the English language was and is to the
</p>
<p>tenor and effect following that is to say " (Oh) Maharaja's acting up to that commen-

<p>tary, defiling the wives and daughters of your devotees desist from that and destroy
</p>
<p>at once immorality such as that of the company at the Rns festivar without this
</p>
<p>that the said alleged libel being duly or correctly translated by James Flynn, Esquire,
</p>
<p>the sworn Chief Translator of this Honorable Court, into the English language was
</p>
<p>or is according to the tenor in the said plaint alleged in manner and form as thereby
</p>
<p>alleged, and of this the defendants put themselves upon the Court, &c.
</p>
<p>And for a seventh plea to the said plaint as to the printing and publishing and
</p>
<p>causing to be printed and published the following part of the said supposed libel
</p>
<p>that is to say [here follows a great portion of the libel in the Gujrati language].

<p>Which words are by the said plaint alleged and surmised to be therein duly and
</p>
<p>correctly translated into the English language, and to be according to the tenor following
</p>
<p>that is to say [here follows English translation of the above portion of the libel].
</p>
<p>The defendants say that before and at the time of the committing the said supposed
</p>
<p>grievances there was .at Bombay and at divers other places in India a certain sect
</p>
<p>of Hindus called the sect of Vallahacharr/a and also called Yaishnavas and in the said
</p>
<p>supposed libel, and also in the said plaint and hereinbefore named and holding professing
</p>
<p>and practising certain opinions as to religions and morals opposed to the ancient religious
</p>
<p>and moral laws of the Hindus, and more particularly to such of the said religious and
</p>
<p>moral laws as prescribe to the Hindus, the observance of piety towards their Gods, and
</p>
<p>of chastity, sobriety and virtue towards and amongst themselves for that, whereas by
</p>
<p>the said last mentioned laws all good and true Hindus are bound to believe and to
</p>
<p>hold that the Gods and their laws are eternal and unchangeable and that the Godhead
</p>
<p>is not capable ot being procreated or begotten by man, and that it is a wicked and
</p>
<p>impious thing for a mere man to pretend to be a God or to be capable of begetting
</p>
<p>a God or to practise impostures in that behalf on any people, and that it is altogether
</p>
<p>against religion and morality for maidens before marriage to have carnal intercourse with any
</p>
<p>man, or for wives to have such intercourse with any man but their own husbands, yet
</p>
<p>nevertheless before and at the time aforesaid, the said sect then did hold, profess, and
</p>
<p>practise, amongst other impious, wicked, and anti-social opinions, the opinions following, that
</p>
<p>is to say  that the leaders of the said sect and the naturally begotten and adopted sons of such
</p>

</p>
<p>and ought to be worshipped implicitly obeyed and served as Gods by the members of the said
</p>
<p>sect with all the minds, bodies, and properties of such sectaries, and that the neglect of
</p>
<p>any such to perform the said worship implicit obedience and service, is a sin of the
</p>
<p>gravest character and that it is the duty of the female members in particular of
</p>
<p>the said sect to love the said leaders with adulterine love and sensual lust and
</p>
<p>perform the said worship, implicit obedience and service with their bodies by submitting
</p>
<p>to have carnal intercourse [with any of the said leaders] whensoever called upon or
</p>
<p>required by any of the latter so to do, albeit such female members are or may be
</p>
<p>unmarried maidens or wives of other men and in no wise married or betrothed in
</p>
<p>marriage to the said leaders ; and the defendants aver that before and at the time of
</p>
<p>the committing of the said grievances, the said leaders of the said sect pretenend to be
</p>
<p>such Incarnations and Gods as aforesaid and to have such capacity as aforesaid, and
</p>
<p>23
</p>
<p>entitled to be so vrorshiped, implicitly obeyed, and served as aforesaid, and permitted
</p>
<p>or sanctioned the performance in manner aforesaid of such worship implicit obedience and
</p>
<p>service, thereby practising great impostures on their said sectaries and on the Hindu
</p>
<p>people in that behalf. And the defendants aver that before and at the time of the
</p>
<p>committing of the said supposed grievances the leaders of the said sect were dispersed
</p>
<p>over the Presidency of Bombay and other parts of India and were in number about
</p>
<p>70 in all and were called indiscriminately Gurus, Achari/as, Gossains, Vandravun
</p>
<p>Gomais and also Maharajas and in fact were the said Maharajas in the said supposed
</p>
<p>libel and plaint and hereinbefore mentioned, and that the plaintiff was one of the
</p>
<p>said Maharajas, and the defendants aver that in and by the religious books of and
</p>
<p>received as of authority by and among the said sect and in particular in and by a
</p>
<p>certain book called " Vitha lesha Katna Yivema," and the commentary thereon, every such
</p>
<p>leader is described as the husband of many women (to wit his devotees) even although
</p>
<p>himself may have no wife or only one wife and as the ocean of wanton amorous
</p>
<p>sport with many women (which is the sea of licentiousness in the said supposed libel,
</p>
<p>and in the plaint hereinbefore mentioned) and also as one whose sole aim is wanton
</p>
<p>amorous sport with many women ; And the defendants aver that before and at the
</p>
<p>time of the committing of the said supposed grievances the said religious books of and
</p>
<p>then received by the said sect contained many passages of the like indecent and immoral
</p>
<p>character, and whereby in direct terms adultery and fornication are encouraged and com-
</p>
<p>mended, and also whereby the said sectaries were then taught and instructed to gratify
</p>
<p>their passions in this life, and they do so gratify them, and especially at Ras festival
</p>
<p>in the said supposed libel and plaint mentioned as the surest way of pleasing the
</p>
<p>Gods, and procuring eternal happiness in a future life and other false and heretical
</p>
<p>and immoral opinions were then inculcated without any opposition from the said leaders
</p>
<p>and with their connivance and acquiescence, And in particular in and by one of the
</p>
<p>said books to wit the said commentary of the said Gokulnathjee in the said supposed
</p>
<p>libel and plaint, and hereinbefore respectively mentioned and also in and by another
</p>
<p>of the said books to wit called " Sidkant Rakasya' and also in and by another
</p>
<p>of the said books, to wit called " Kavi Charitra," and in and by others of the said
</p>
<p>books it is mentioned and professed to the effect that among the principal laws,
</p>
<p>doctrines and commandments of the said sect of Valabhacharya were the following, that
</p>
<p>is to say  to secure the firm support of some one of the said leaders and to worship
</p>
<p>the God in^ him incarnate are the only principal means of the deliverance of the soul

<p>from the body and the salvation thereof, and the re-absorptlon thereof into the Divine
</p>
<p>essence, and that it is the duty of every member of the said sect to forsake the sense
</p>
<p>of shame with reference to public opinion and the commandments of the said sacred
</p>
<p>books and laws of the Hindus and to be suppliants to some of such leaders for salvation,
</p>
<p>and to be humble before him and to believe that he tlie said member is not a
</p>
<p>man, but a woman servant of such leader, and to praise always his  the said leader's
</p>
<p>virtues and the greatness of his name, and to obey his commands and to put faith
</p>
<p>in all his acts and words and to be ever associate unto his service and to consider
</p>
<p>himself the said sectary and his wife and children and all that is his as the property
</p>
<p>of his said leader and to offer them and present every thing and even the said sectary's
</p>
<p>wives and children to the said leader for his enjoyment and use and for the trans-
</p>
<p>formation thereof into the nature of the great God Brahma before he the said sectary
</p>
<p>shall himself presume to use or enjoy the same, and that by acting otherwise the said
</p>
<p>24
</p>
<p>eectary shall and will become guilty of sin, and incur the Divine punishments appointed
</p>
<p>to the same, And the defendants aver that before and at the time aforesaid in and by
</p>
<p>others of the said books of and received by the said sect as aforesaid to wit one book
</p>
<p>called " Chorasi Vaishnava-Ki-Barta" and also to wit another book called Rus Eus,
</p>
<p>and also to wit another book called " Chaturshloki Bhagvat," and to wit " another book
</p>
<p>called Pushti Parvha Maryada Tika," and to wit another book called " Svadharma Vardhak
</p>
<p>Annay Samshay chedak," (and which last mentioned book was and is printed, published, and
</p>
<p>circulated in Bombay aforesaid by and under the authority of the plaintiff himself, and by
</p>
<p>and under the authority of a certain society of the said sect for the propagation
</p>
<p>of the doctrines of the same sect to wit a society then and now called to wit the
</p>
<p>Vaishnav Dharma Prasarak of which Society the plaintiff was and is a member and also
</p>
<p>founder, and president,) and also in and by other books it was professed, stated, and
</p>
<p>maintained to the effect that it is the creed of the said sect that God of whom the
</p>
<p>said leaders so pretend as aforesaid to be the Incarnations doth abide in the houses of
</p>
<p>and in union with the members thereof by or with adulterine love like unto that in the
</p>
<p>excessive affection whereof an adulteresss makes abandonment of body, mind, and wealth,
</p>
<p>to her adulterer. And that when God is displeased with any sectary his or her said
</p>
<p>leader saves him from that displeasure of God but that when the said leader is
</p>
<p>displeased with the said sectary none can save him or her from that displeasure of the
</p>
<p>leader, and that therefore the said sectary ought to serve the said leader with
</p>
<p>his or her body and wealth and please tlie leader aforesaid, and also ought
</p>
<p>necessarily to worship in an equal manner the said leader and God only and that
</p>
<p>he or she can only by worshipping such leader go to the heaven appointed as a
</p>
<p>reward for the worship of God and that the said leaders are manifestly God, the
</p>
<p>excellent Being himself. And that the punishment of him or her who holds his or
</p>
<p>her leader and God himself to be different or distinct beings shall be that of being
</p>
<p>born again in the condition of a bird called Sichana, and the punishment of him or
</p>
<p>her who sits with legs folded in front before his or her leader shall be that of being
</p>
<p>born again in the condition of a serpent, and the punishment of him or her who
</p>
<p>displays his or her learning before his or her leader shall be that of being thrice again
</p>
<p>born dumb and thrice again born in the condition of a dog or ass, and that the
</p>
<p>punishment of him or her who displays activity before his or her leader shall be that
</p>
<p>of being born again in the condition of a bird called Jarakh and the punishment of him
</p>
<p>or her who shows the soles of his or her feet to his or her leader shall be that of

</p>
<p>being born again and for ten years remaining in the condition of a serpent and the
</p>
<p>punishment of him or her who disobeys the order of such leader shall be the going
</p>
<p>to Asepatra and other dreadful hells, and the forfeiture of all merit before God and
</p>
<p>that the punishment of him or her who performs worship without seeing and paying
</p>
<p>his or her respects to his or her leader shall be the sterility of such worship, and
</p>
<p>that the punishment of him or her who divulges the secrets of his or her leader or of
</p>
<p>God shall be that of being thrice again born in the condition of dog, and that in the
</p>
<p>Kalliyug in the said supposed libel and plaint and hereinbefore mentioned there is no
</p>
<p>means of salvation similar to worship to wit the worship of one of the said leaders
</p>
<p>and therefore that the said sectaries should regard each his or her leader as God nay
</p>
<p>and as a being greater than God and that all people and all things are God's own
</p>
<p>and that consequently the sin of adultery and dishonesty does not affect him (to
</p>
<p>wit incarnate as aforesaid) but is ordained only for the world to wit the followers of
</p>
<p>the said sect, and that if any persons shall say that it is sinful to entertain adulterine
</p>
<p>love towards God, such persons are ignorant fools ; for in God all relations abide, and
</p>
<p>the two species of man and woman do not exist, but that both are the spirit of
</p>
<p>God, and that C' nsequently when he (to wit incarnate as aforesaid) commits adultery, he
</p>
<p>is at play with his own spirit and in that no sin is incurred either by God to wit
</p>
<p>incarnate in the said leaders or any of them or by this world to wit the female
</p>
<p>members aforesaid and that God himself had granted to the Veds to wit religious
</p>
<p>preceptors of the Hindus at their request permission to entertain adulterine love for the
</p>
<p>God Krishna to wit the God of whom the said leaders pretend to be Incarnations as
</p>
<p>aforesaid, and in the form of sheperdesses to be adulterously and carnally known and
</p>
<p>enjoyed by the said God and that in like manner at the request of 16,000 sages
</p>
<p>who were enamoured of another God, the same became and were in the forms
</p>
<p>of shepherdesses carnally known and enjoyed by the said God to wit incarnate
</p>
<p>as aforesaid, and all the shepherdesses aforesaid loved God as their adulterer
</p>
<p>and he became an adulterer and made them happy, and that God to wit incarnate as
</p>
<p>aforesaid is all form and that he is in the form of father and of husband and of son
</p>
<p>and of 'adulterer and sustaining the life of devotees by adulterine love, and that they
</p>
<p>who say that this is sin are iynorant and not devotees, but wishing for the love of
</p>
<p>hell, and as it were asses feeding on the dunghill but knowing not the pleasures of
</p>
<p>the garden and to whom to eat sugar is death and to feed on the rubbish of dunghills
</p>
<p>is life ; And that bj experience it is clearly known that there is no love in any thing
</p>
<p>like adulterine love for that by day and night and amid the engagements of the
</p>
<p>adulteress in her household work, her mind is directed to the object of meeting her
</p>
<p>adulterer and for that during her separation from him and by reason thereof, she loaths
</p>
<p>her food and precious attire and dies of excessive grief, And that they are fools who
</p>
<p>say that such love is loathsome to wit before God. And these, the defendants aver
</p>
<p>that the several matters aforesaid, are more fully and at large set forth in the said
</p>
<p>several books of and received by the said sect and that they crave leave to refer to
</p>
<p>the same books respectively when produced and shewn unto this Honorable Court. And
</p>
<p>the defendants aver that the said sect is in the premises according to the said
</p>
<p>ancient Hindu laws and religion a new heresy and disorder and altogether a false
</p>
<p>and heretical sect and withal a sect delusive to_ simple people and that in par-
</p>
<p>ticular it is a heresy, a sham and a delusion and a doctrine not written in any
</p>
<p>ved or puran or shasira or sacred books of the said Hindus or law book as
</p>
<p>aforesaid that one's married wife should be made over to a Maharaj or to a religious

<p>preceptor before being enjoyed or that one's daughter should be so made over. But the
</p>
<p>defendants further say that nevertheless it is a necessary consequence of the aforesaid
</p>
<p>commentary of the said Goculnathjee, so received by the said sect as aforesaid that
</p>
<p>before a member thereof has enjoyed his own married wife, he should make her over
</p>
<p>to his leader to wit to the Maharaj and that he the said member should also make
</p>
<p>over to him his said member's sons and daughters and that after having got married
</p>
<p>and before having himself enjoyed his wife, he the said member should make an offering
</p>
<p>of her to the said leader to wit the Maharaj aforesaid ; after which he the said member
</p>
<p>should apply her to his the said member's own use ; and the defendants aver that by
</p>
<p>reason of the said heresy, sham and delusion they were as orthodox believers in religion
</p>
<p>and morality seized with disgust and indignation and that they were and are of opinion
</p>
<p>that there can be no greater heresy or deceitt han thus, to blind people and throw dust
</p>
<p>4
</p>
<p>26
</p>
<p>into their eyes and in the name and under the pretence of religion to assert the right
</p>
<p>of the said leaders to enjoy the tender maidens and wives and daughters of the people
</p>
<p>30 blinded as aforesaid, and the defendants aver that not only the said Goculnathjee by
</p>
<p>his heavy composed commentary abovementioned, but also the composers and compilers
</p>
<p>of all the said other books had before the committing of the said supposed grievances
</p>
<p>thereby attached to the said Vaishnava pursuasion to wit the said sect a great blot of
</p>
<p>ink and reproach, and that in acting according or up to the said commentary the
</p>
<p>Maharajas who did so act were necessarily guilty of defiling the wives and daughters
</p>
<p>of their devotees, and themselves appear to be immersed in the sea of licentiousness,
</p>
<p>and by so appearing and so long as they do so appear and do not desist from so
</p>
<p>acting up to that commentary for so long they necessarily shall not be competent to
</p>
<p>convey religious exhortation nor can give religious admonition and propagate their own
</p>
<p>religious faith. And the defendants aver that before and at the time of the committing
</p>
<p>of the said grievances, the said Maharajas were commonly worshipped and obeyed and
</p>
<p>served as Gods and Incarnations of the great God Brahma by their male and female
</p>
<p>devotees in the said supposed libel and plaint and hereinbefore mentioned with such
</p>
<p>adulterine love and in mann-er and form as in and by the said books of and received
</p>
<p>by the said sect as taught and inculcated and as hereinbefore in that behalf is set forth,
</p>
<p>and that thereby and in consequence thereof great crimes and scandals were committed
</p>
<p>and occasioned, and great discredit and dissertion brought upon and into the said sect.
</p>
<p>And in particular the defendants aver that it was then the common practice and then
</p>
<p>commonly and as well in the said sect as without the same, reputed and believed to
</p>
<p>be the general practice of, by and for the most part of, the said Maharajs to act according
</p>
<p>to the aforesaid teachings and instructions of the said commentary and such other books
</p>
<p>as aforesaid, and to obtain and have in right of their said pretended incarnations
</p>
<p>and godships and in the name of the said religion carnal intercourse with and
</p>
<p>to defile their said female devotees being such wives or daughters as aforesaid.
</p>
<p>And the defendants further aver that according to the Hindu Laws and religion aforesaid
</p>
<p>before and at the time of the committing of the said supposed grievances it was and
</p>
<p>still is unlawful and criminal for any person to handle the breasts of any woman not
</p>
<p>being his wife or lawful concubine or to throw goolal upon the same or to take indecent
</p>
<p>liberties with her person, and that such offences then were and still are by the said
</p>
<p>law and religion accounted and deemed to amount to adultery, and that nevertheless it
</p>
<p>was before and at the time of the committing of the said supposed grievances and still

</p>
<p>is the practice of the said Maharajas publicly as well as privately to lay their hands
</p>
<p>upon and hold and handle the breasts of the female devotees of their said sect albeit
</p>
<p>neither wives nor lawful concubines of them the said Maharajas and to cast and throw
</p>
<p>goolal upon the breasts of the said devotees And the defendants aver that before the
</p>
<p>time of the committing of the said supposed grievances, the plaintiff himself then being such
</p>
<p>Maharaja as aforesaid confessed and declared to two merchants of the said sect as the
</p>
<p>fact was that adultery was then and theretofore practised among the said Maharajas
</p>
<p>thereof, and he then further alleged that they had been corrupted thereunto and to other
</p>
<p>evil manners through or by reason of their having come into contact and intimacy
</p>
<p>with the pilgrims who eschew marriage and are called Varkats. And the defendants
</p>
<p>aver that shortly before the committing of the said supposed grievances it had been
</p>
<p>also recently stated and declared by a Maharaj of high station in the said sect to wit one
</p>
<p>Jevanjee Maharaj to drivers respectable members of the said sect, that he the said Maharaj was
</p>
<p>27
</p>
<p>unaole to prevent his said brothers from committing adultery or fornication with the
</p>
<p>said female devotees of the said sect. And the defendants aver that both before and
</p>
<p>at the time of the committing of the said supposed grievances the licentiousness of many
</p>
<p>of the said Maharajas was a matter of notoriety in the said sect and generally among
</p>
<p>the said followers and had frequently been denounced by some of the latter in
</p>
<p>Guzerathee pamphlets, newpapers, handbills and placards and by other means of
</p>
<p>publication amongst the natives of this presidency, and that in particular at the end
</p>
<p>of the Christian year 1855 the Bhatias, who then were members of the said sect
</p>
<p>incensed at the number of instances of the defilement of women of the said sect by
</p>
<p>Maharajas at the temples where and on the occasions when the said women were
</p>
<p>assembled for the purpose of worshipping the Gods and Maharajas aforesaid in conformity
</p>
<p>with the teachings aforesaid, convened and met together in a public meeting and there-
</p>
<p>at came to a resolution and did resolve to the effect that for the future none of
</p>
<p>their wives or daughters should be ever allowed to resort to the said temples or to
</p>
<p>the said Maharajas for worship except at and during certain stated hours in the
</p>
<p>morning at end during which hours they the said Maharajas would to the knowledge
</p>
<p>of the said Bhattias be entirely occupied with certain daily exercises of their religious
</p>
<p>retical, insomuch that they would be then wholly unable to have any intercourse with
</p>
<p>any of the women last aforesaid, and the defendants aver that the plaintiff himself
</p>
<p>as such Maharajas aforesaid some months before the time of the committing of the
</p>
<p>said supposed grievances did, in the course of a conversation with a Bhattia of the
</p>
<p>said sect, assert and undertake the defence of the adulterous debauched conduct
</p>
<p>of the said Maharajas or to excuse the same, and did then and to that end
</p>
<p>profess and maintain to the said last mentioned Bhattia in effect ihat there was no
</p>
<p>crime or sin in the practice of adultery, and that on the contrary the same was whole-
</p>
<p>some in itself and effectual to sustain and increase the vigor and strength of man, and
</p>
<p>that he the plaintiff had so found and known the said practice in fact to be from his
</p>
<p>own experience thereof as well as from that of the athletics of the Court of the Guicowar
</p>
<p>each of whom as the plaintiff then asserted was in the habit of keeping four or five
</p>
<p>women as concubines and of preparing themselves for a wrestling or other athletic
</p>
<p>exercise by a preliminary coition with one or more of the women last aforesaid. And
</p>
<p>the plaintiff then also defended and extolled promiscuous coition and professed that by
</p>
<p>the enjoyment of divers females the blood of the man enjoying the same becomes and
</p>
<p>is greatly heightened and improved. And these defendants further aver that before and

</p>
<p>at the time of the committing of the said grievances the plaintiff was commonly
</p>
<p>reputed and known in Bombay and in Surat and elsewhere in India to be addicted
</p>
<p>to the society of women of loose and light life and to be himself a man of debauched
</p>
<p>morals and to be in the habit of receiving women and amongst others female devotees
</p>
<p>of the said sect into his private apartment and to chambering and wantonness and to
</p>
<p>taking indecent liberties with women of his said sect but not being his wives or
</p>
<p>lawful concubines, and in particular that about 8 or 10 years before the committing
</p>
<p>of the said supposed grievances to wit in a certain room at Beyt in the Presidency
</p>
<p>of Bombay aforesaid in which room certain of the said women then were, the plain-
</p>
<p>tiff scattered, threw and cast upon their persons cfoolal until the said room was
</p>
<p>filled and darkened with the same, and that he the plaintiff then in the said room
</p>
<p>60 thereby darkened as aforesaid took indecent liberties with a yung person there being
</p>
<p>one of the said women of his sect but not being his wife or lawful concubine to
</p>
<p>28
</p>
<p>an extent which by Hindu Law is deemed to be and in fact is highly criminal
</p>
<p>and in fact equivalent and tantamount to the crime of adultery to wit the indecent liberty
</p>
<p>of laying hold with his hands her breasts and handling the same, and further in the
</p>
<p>course of the Christian year 1860 the plaintiff did in a certain conversation to wit at
</p>
<p>Bombay aforesaid with a certain member of his said sect confess and admit the pre-
</p>
<p>mises in this averment set forth, and further that in the course of the same year
</p>
<p>last aforesaid the plaintiff did retire into and for the space of one hour or thereabouts
</p>
<p>remain in his private apartment to wit at Bombay aforesaid alone with a certain
</p>
<p>female of his said sect but not being his wife or lawful concubine and then and there
</p>
<p>have carnal intercourse with her. And that on another occasion in the course of the
</p>
<p>Christian year 1860 before the committing of the said alleged grievances the pkintiff
</p>
<p>in his private apartment to wit at Bombay aforesaid had carnal intercourse with a
</p>
<p>female of his said sect and not being a wife or lawful concubine of him the plaintiff.
</p>
<p>And lastly that within th.. course of the last year and before the committing of the
</p>
<p>said supposed grievances the plaintiff became and was by reason of his debauched
</p>
<p>conduct affected with a certain disease called the Great or French Pox otherwise the
</p>
<p>venereal disease. And the defendants aver that the defendant Karsandass Mooljee was
</p>
<p>before and at the time of the committing of said supposed grievances a member of the
</p>
<p>said sect and that being such member thereof and being greatly zealous for the honor and
</p>
<p>well being thereof and much affected and grieved by reason of the crimes and scandals
</p>
<p>aforesaid and anxious to promote a reform of the said sect and of its said leaders
</p>
<p>in the premises, he then being the editor of the newspaper mentioned in the said plaint,
</p>
<p>and in which the said supposed libel is by the said plaint alleged to have been pub-
</p>
<p>lished did cause and procure to be printed and published by the defendant Nanabhoy
</p>
<p>E,ustomjee Eanneenah therein certain articles and writings which were by him the
</p>
<p>first-named defendant designed to promote and which did in fact promote a reformation
</p>
<p>of the said sect in the premises amongst other matters. And the defendants further
</p>
<p>aver that before and at the time of the committing of the said supposed grievances the
</p>
<p>plaintiff had commenced the composing, printing, publishing, and issuing among the
</p>

<p>small Guzerati book or work the plaintiff by an article or essay therein by him inserted

<p>the effect that any person who was or might become or be desirous of entering into

</p>
<p>Hindu religion aforesaid. And that the plaintiff before the time of the committing of

<p>the said supposed grievances had also in his said book or work caused to be printed
</p>
<p>and published a profession and declaration on his part to the effect that it was the

<p>doctrine of the said sect and of the plaintiff as such Maharaj thereof as aforesaid, that

<p>r.he said sect ought to lay aside and act in c':^ntravention of the uaid Yeds being sacred

<p>to wit on the 29th day of September in the Christian year 1860 the plaintiff in and
</p>
<p>by the said newspaper called the Chabook caused to be printed and published a statement

</p>
<p>one goes from the gates of the Fort (to wit of Bombay aforesaid) to proceed to
</p>
<p>Walkeshwur and some one from the same Fort to Byculla so exactly the original
</p>
<p>courses of the said Ved and the said Purans in the said supposed Libel and plaint
</p>
<p>and hereinbefore mentioned and wherein the said ancient religious laws of the said
</p>
<p>Hindus are contained having gone forward had diverged into different ways to wit ways
</p>
<p>of a different religion and of a different morality from the ancient Hindu religion and
</p>
<p>morality. And the defendants aver that the said last mentioned, publications or any or either
</p>
<p>of them in no wise exculpated the plaintiff in th6 premises but on the contrary confirmed the
</p>
<p>said repute and notoriety of his immorality and proved him and the said other Maha-
</p>
<p>rajas to be heretics from the said ancient religion and morality. And the defendants
</p>
<p>say that it is true as stated in the said supposed libel that no other Hindu sectaries
</p>
<p>have ever perpetrated such shamlessness, subtlety, immodesty, rascality, and deceit as have
</p>
<p>the said Maharajas, and that they by their practices aforesaid thrown dust into the
</p>
<p>eyes of simple people and that the said Maharajas have written in their books about
</p>
<p>enjoying the tender maidens, the people's wives and daughters and have enjoyed them
</p>
<p>accordingly, and that great flames of zeal have sprung up within the hearts of the
</p>
<p>defendants thereat, and that the defendants have had to grieve over their Hindu friends
</p>
<p>and the weak powers of reflection of those friends, and that the plaintiff's ancestors
</p>
<p>have scattered the dust of falsehood in the eyes of simple people and thereby made
</p>
<p>them blind, and that if the plaintiff wishes to propagate or spread abroad religion he
</p>
<p>ought personally to adopt a virtuous course of conduct to admonish the said other
</p>
<p>Maharajs to do the same. Wherefore they the defendants published and caused and
</p>
<p>procured to be published the said supposed libellous matter in the introductory part of

</p>
<p>THE CONSPIRACY CASE ARISING OUT OF THE PLEAS
</p>
<p>PUT IN BY THE DEFANDANTS.
</p>
<p>(Soon after the above pleas were put in by the defendants, Parbhoodass, the
</p>
<p>manager of the Maharaja's case, obtained a copy of them, and visited several Bhattias,
</p>
<p>and informed them that if the pleas put in by the defendants were proved, Jadunath-
</p>
<p>jee Maharaja would lose the case. In consequence of this, several Bhattias held three
</p>
<p>or four private meetings, in the last of which it was resolved that the whole Bhattia
</p>
<p>caste should be invited to subscribe their signatures to a document intended to frustrate
</p>
<p>the inteniions of the defendants. In pursuance of this resolution, a general meeting of
</p>
<p>the Bhattia community was held in the Mahjan oart, close to the Elphinstone Institution
</p>
<p>on 6th September 1861. In this meeting it was resolved that whoever gave evidence
</p>
<p>against the Maharaj, should be called to account according to the rules of the caste.
</p>
<p>As this resolution was illegal, the Editor of the Satya Prakash charged nine Bhattias,
</p>
<p>who took a leading part in effecting the above resolution, with conspiracy. The pre-
</p>
<p>liminary examination of this charge, commenced on the 11th of September 1861, in
</p>
<p>the Fort Police Court, before W. Crawford, Esquire, Senior Magistrate, and terminated
</p>
<p>on the 16th November 1861, after being heard for nine days. The Magistrate com-
</p>
<p>mitted the case to the Sessions. On the 3rd of December when the Sessions opened,
</p>
<p>the Hon'ble Justice Arnould in charging the Grand Jury spoke as follows with regard
</p>
<p>to this conspiracy case :  )
</p>
<p>" There were two cases of conspiracy. One of them was a charge of misdemeanour
</p>
<p>only, in which Goculdass Lilladhur and eighc others were indicted for conspiring to
</p>
<p>obstruct and defeat the course of justice, by dissuading and preventing certain witnesses
</p>
<p>from giving evidence in a case pending before this Court. His Lordship said he had
</p>
<p>not looked over the authorities bearing upon the indictment, but from the analogy of
</p>
<p>law and decisions in somewhat similar cases, he had no doubt that the charge would
</p>
<p>well lie against the parties concerned. The facts were these. The Editor of the Rast
</p>
<p>Go/tar  Karsandass Mooljee was the name of the gentleman, His Lordship supposed 
</p>
<p>published an article containing certain charges and imputations against the Maharajs,
</p>
<p>one of whom has brought an action of libel against the Editor and publisher. The
</p>
<p>Editor has, in that case, put upon record certain pleas of justification, to the effect
</p>
<p>that the charges were perfectly true, and in order to substantiate those pleas, it was
</p>
<p>necessary for him to summon a number of witnesses at the trial of the cause, on the
</p>
<p>Civil side of this court. It appeared then that, with the view of preventing those

</p>
<p>witnesses from giving evidence in favor of the Editor, Goculdass Lilladhur and others
</p>
<p>met in a body to concert measures to secure their object, in other words, to obstruct
</p>
<p>and impede the course of public justice. There was no doubt that the alleged object
</p>
<p>of the meeting amounted, in effect, to the charge preferred against these parties, and
</p>
<p>they were properly brought up to stand the trial. His Lordship might mention that
</p>
<p>the case was in no way against the Maharaj ; it was one in which the Maharaj
</p>
<p>himself had set the Supreme Court in motion, for obtaining redress from those who,
</p>
<p>he considered, had published false imputations against him. However, if any parties,
</p>
<p>acting on his behalf, attempted to dissuade and prevent others from giving evidence in
</p>
<p>this court, they would be guilty of obstructing and defeating justice. The question
</p>
<p>would be, was there evidence to sustain the indictment ? The evidence recorded, His
</p>
<p>Lordship would confess, was conflicting and not, upon the whole, clear in some points.
</p>
<p>But having read the depositions, he thought the jury would be justified in returning a
</p>
<p>true bill against the parlies charged with the conspiracy. His Lordship was of opinion
</p>
<p>that, on the face of the depositions, a sufficient case was made out, and the Grand
</p>
<p>Jury might safely return a true bill, leaving the Petit Jury to deal with the evidence
</p>
<p>such as it was."

</p>
<p>THE TRIAL OF THE BHATTIA CONSPIRACY CASE.
</p>
<p>SUPREME COURT.-Crown Side.
</p>
<p>FOURTH CRIMINAL SESSIONS OF 1861.
</p>
<p>(Before Sir Joseph Arnould Kt.,)
</p>
<p>Thursday, \2f.h Deaunber 1861.
</p>
<p>His LoRDsbiP took his seat on the bench precisely at ten o'clock when the

</p>
<p>Messrs. Bayley and Barton applied to the Court to allow their clients to sit outside
</p>
<p>the dock. The request was complied v/ith.
</p>
<p>The names of nine defendants, Goculdass Lilladhur, Luckmidass Darajee, Adut

<p>Kirpall, Canjee Shamjee, Mooljee Moorarjee, Damodhur Hurjee alias Damjee Heera,
</p>
<p>Ragoo Shamjee, Dyal Jairaz, and Bhugwanjee Dwarkadass, were then called, and the

<p>prisoners answered. The indictment was read over containing five counts. The prisoners

<p>pleaded not guilty.

</p>
<p>indictment which charged the defendants with conspiracy and that conspiracy was not less
</p>
<p>conspiracy for being directed against the public. There was a certain action which was yet
</p>
<p>to be tried on the plea side of this Court, and that it was for preventing persons from
</p>
<p>giving evidence for the prosecutor in this action, and preventing them likewise from appearing.
</p>
<p>Every one of the counts in the present indictment will be supported by evidence. The
</p>
<p>first witness that will be called in this case is the prosecutor, who is the editor of a
</p>
<p>.32
</p>
<p>Native newspaper, and is likewise the defendant in the libel case, and the printer of
</p>
<p>that paper is also a party in that action. There were certain articles which appeared
</p>
<p>in the newspaper in question, advocating the views of the Reform party, that term being
</p>
<p>applied to Eeligion and not to Politics. The prosecutor in the performance of his literary
</p>
<p>labours considered it to be his duty to point to the truism, which is admitted by
</p>
<p>learned men and scholars of all countries, that all that is good in religion is ancient,
</p>
<p>and that that which tends to break up those time-honored institutions are of modern
</p>
<p>innovation, all these impediments are of recent date  such as " Suttee" and " Infanticide."
</p>
<p>There is nothing sacred in these practices. The prosecutor belongs to the Reform party,
</p>
<p>because his family have belonged to that party. He believes that if he was to violate
</p>
<p>his principles, he would lose all social privileges. What he desired was to restore
</p>
<p>that which was traditionary in all its pristine purity, and to expose the rest. In respect
</p>
<p>to the action pending against the prosecutor, he was prepared to abide by the conse-
</p>
<p>quences, and pleaded the justification of the publication of the alleged libel, he would
</p>
<p>retract nothing. In that action it was most material for him to secure the Bhattia witnesses.
</p>
<p>As soon as it became known that he required their evidence, every means of intimidation
</p>
<p>had been employed, so much so that it became necessary for him to seek the protection
</p>
<p>of the law. On the first day that the conspiracy broke forth, there was neither more
</p>
<p>nor less than a rout or riot, which would be proved by witnesses. There would be
</p>
<p>witnesses ca%d to speak fiom the commencement of the conspiracy. There were caste
</p>
<p>meetings held at which hand bills had been distributed, and an influential member of
</p>
<p>the caste had been tampered with to prevent him from assisting the prosecutor in his
</p>
<p>case. It would be proved that the defendants took an active part in those meetings.
</p>
<p>(1.) Karsandass Mooljee, examined by Mr. Anstey  lam the Editor of a newspaper
</p>
<p>called the Rast Goftar and Satya Prakash. The name of the sect to which I
</p>
<p>belong is Vallabhacharia, and the Maharajas are at the head of that sect. There are
</p>
<p>about sixty or seventy Maharajas in India. I am the defendant of a libel action on
</p>
<p>the plea side of this Court. The action was brought for an article which appeared in
</p>
<p>my newspaper. I have put in a plea of justification. In that article I stated the
</p>
<p>doctrine and discipline of the sect, and the conduct of the Maharajas. I am prepared
</p>
<p>to call witnesses at the trial on my plea of justification. The evidence of those wit-
</p>
<p>nesses will be oral and documentary evidence. One of those documents used in
</p>
<p>this trial is used in the plea of justification  a document regarding the interpretation
</p>
<p>of a Guzerati verse by Goculnathjee Maharaj. I have subpoenaed many witnesses,

</p>
<p>Bhattias, and have invited many. If the names of some of those witnesses should
</p>
<p>transpire before the trial, it would do harm. I have no right to attend the caste
</p>
<p>meetings of the Bhattias. In consequence of information I received from Bhattias, I
</p>
<p>took out summonses for the prisoners on the 9th of September, and on the 11th
</p>
<p>of September I made a statement in prisoners' presence before Mr. Crawford. There
</p>
<p>were many Bhattias present in Court  about 2,000 or 3,000. As I was going away
</p>
<p>I was assaulted. I left without n:aking any disturbance. [Mr. Bay ley objected to
</p>
<p>witness saying by whom he was assaulted, as this was after the conspiracy had taken
</p>
<p>place. Mr. Anstey said, there was no evidence yet as to the date of the conspiracy ;
</p>
<p>but if so, then this question was permissible. This indictment was " of conspiracy with
</p>
<p>others unknown"  and the witness had said he was assaulted by other Bhattias. The
</p>
<p>indictment did not say that the conspiracy had ended yet, but found that the action
</p>
<p>was still pending. He had a perfect right to give this new overt act which had occurred
</p>
<p>33
</p>
<p>before the finding et' this indictment, and would cite authority for the right. Mr.
</p>
<p>Bayley objected on the ground that the defendants were not present. Justice Arnould
</p>
<p>said that made no difference. Mr. Bayley begged the Court to take a note of that objec-
</p>
<p>tion. Mr. Anstey said the witness had already sworn that the defendants were
</p>
<p>present.] I was assaulted by Bhattias. Nothing was said by myself or by the defendants.
</p>
<p>I returned to the Court, and obtained the protection of the Magistrate. I never assaulted
</p>
<p>any of the defendants.
</p>
<p>Gross-examined hij Mr. Barton.  " I am 28 years of age. I belong to the
</p>
<p>Keform party. I do not consider myself under the influence of the Maharajas. This
</p>
<p>alleged libel I did not consider filth. It was in no way filth. I did not consider it filth
</p>
<p>to let it be known throughout the world that the Maharajas had connection with our
</p>
<p>wives and daughters. (His Lordship threw out as a hint to Mr. Barton that there was
</p>
<p>a book which we all respected, where very foul things were spoken of in the very
</p>
<p>plainest language. Mr. Barton said it was not a newspaper. He thought the matter
</p>
<p>entirely different.)
</p>
<p>Witness continued :  " I consider that publication would conduce to public mor:i!ity.
</p>
<p>The defendants do not belong to the Eeform party. There is a split in the caste  a
</p>
<p>difference of opinion. It is not a caste row. I am a full member of my caste.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Cross-eramined by Mr. Bayley.  " It was in the Satya Frakash, this libel was pub-
</p>
<p>lished. My co-defendant in that action was the printer of it. I have been connected
</p>
<p>with the press for five or six years. I was editor of the Satya Prakash in June 1858.
</p>
<p>I had on several occasions previous to this, published and written against the Maharajas.
</p>
<p>I have not abused them right and left. I have for some years shown up their practices.
</p>
<p>I have not become more abusive as time rolled on. I remember that a meeting was held in
</p>
<p>the year 1858 on account of my attacks. I don't know that persons were then appointed
</p>
<p>to take proceedings for libel. I don't recollect if there was a report of the proceedings of
</p>
<p>that meeting published in the Satya Prakash on the 28th of June 1858. There are about
</p>
<p>10,000 Bhattias in Bombay, and all look upon the Maharajas as their spiritual guides. I
</p>
<p>look upon the Maharajas as spiritual guides, not as God. The Bhattias have looked upon
</p>
<p>the!h as more than God for 150 years. The Banyas have always done so, so far as I
</p>
<p>know. I decline to say if I am worth Es. 1,000, or any less sum. 1 pay the expenses
</p>
<p>of this prosecution. I am the sole member of my family who has taken this independent
</p>
<p>line of conduct. Not more than fifty Banyans have taken the same view as myself. I

</p>
<p>have subpoe-naed about thirty-five witnesses in the libel action. About four or five Bhattias
</p>
<p>have told me that they were intimidated. Two of those men were called before the
</p>
<p>Police to give evidence. A third, Khatao Muccoondjee, was called but did not answer to
</p>
<p>his name. Goculdass Tezpall is not paying the expenses of this prosecution. I don't
</p>
<p>know that Goculdass Tezpall has set apart a fund for that purpose. I have already
</p>
<p>received Es. 600 in two anonymous letters. I don't know who sent it. The defendants
</p>
<p>were in the police court when I was assaulted. No other assault ever took place, though I
</p>
<p>attended the police court on several occasions.
</p>
<p>Re-examined.  " The Magistrate took proper precautious lo prevent a repetition of
</p>
<p>5
</p>
<p>34
</p>
<p>the assault. Mr. Crawford addressed the Bhattias on the following day. Mr. Forjett was
</p>
<p>subsequently present in person, and only a certain number of Bhattias were allowed to
</p>
<p>enter the court. I decline to answer whether I am worth Ks. 1,000, or any less sum,
</p>
<p>because it is an irrelevant matter and nothing to do whatever with the case. There
</p>
<p>are not more than fifty of those who worship the Maharaj that take the same view as
</p>
<p>I do. I make a distinction between worshipping the Maharaj as God, and worshiping
</p>
<p>him as a spiritual guide. I presented the facts of those practices of the Maharaj in the
</p>
<p>least filthy manner possible consistent with my duty as a journalist."
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey said that the first plea is of denial that the Maharajs were the preceptors of
</p>
<p>the Hindu religion ; the seventh plea, is a plea of justification ; the eighth plea, a plea that
</p>
<p>the publication was true in fact and effect. Issue had been joined on the seventh and
</p>
<p>eighth plea.
</p>
<p>(2.) Luckmidms Kkimjee, examined hij Mr. Dunbar.  " I am one of the leaders or
</p>
<p>head men of the Bhattia caste. It is necessary to take my consent before a meeting of
</p>
<p>the caste is called. No application was made to me to convene the meeting of the 6th of
</p>
<p>September. I first heard that a meeting was to be convened two or three days before. I
</p>
<p>had a communication with Luckinidass Damjee about the meeting before it took place. He
</p>
<p>sent for me. He said to me, ' Come let's go to Mahajun's Oart where the meeting will
</p>
<p>assemble.' I said ' Why is the meeting Jo assemble there ?' He said ' A commentary
</p>
<p>that has been published in the Satf/a Prakash about Goculnatlijee is incorrect, and on
</p>
<p>account of that the caste are going to assemble ' I asked him if he had shown that com-
</p>
<p>mentary to any Shastri, and he said ' No !' I said ' Let us assemble fifteen or twenty
</p>
<p>Shastris, and take their opinion upon the commentary published in the Satya Prakash on
</p>
<p>the verse of Goculnathjee.' Gocu'nathjee was a writer, a Maharaj, who lived some 200
</p>
<p>years ago, and his books are looked on as authority in the sect. I said, ' We should take
</p>
<p>the opinion of the Shastris in writing, take their signatures to the writing, and affix ours.'
</p>
<p>Luckmidass said, ' No, let us go there, they are all assembled there.' I said, ' How can we
</p>
<p>g,ffix our signatures till we know the meaning of the writing.' Luckmidass had informed
</p>
<p>me that the meeting was to sign a document ; it was then that I proposed we should
</p>
<p>send it to the Shastris. Luckmidass said, ' They will ail sign  we shall sign.' I said,
</p>
<p>I have received a summons from the Supreme Court to give evidence on behalf o^the
</p>
<p>defence, and if I go to the meeting I will raise this objection I have just mentioned.
</p>
<p>He then said ' You must not give evidence in the Supreme Court against the Maharaj.
</p>
<p>You are a man of family, and your children will have to be married.' I repeated

</p>
<p>that if I went to the meeting I should raise that objection, and he repeated what he
</p>
<p>had said. I then declined to accompany him. He said to me further that our arrange-
</p>
<p>ments would be made in the Mahajun Oart by which any per'^ons who might give
</p>
<p>evidence against the Maharaj would be punished by the caste [Mr. Barton objected to
</p>
<p>witness stating what he interpreted from Lukmidass' remark. Mr. Ans'ey argued that
</p>
<p>the question was a fair one. Question allowed.] I understood by that, that if I gave
</p>
<p>evidence I wou+d be expelled from the caste. The consequences to my children would
</p>
<p>be that I could not then get them married. On the following day I saw Dyal Jaira?
</p>
<p>and Goculdass Tezpal. The conversation with Luckmidass Damjee was on the day of
</p>
<p>the meeting. The conversation with Dyal Jairaz was at Goculdass' office, opposite the
</p>
<p>Secretariate I asked Dyal Jairaz what took place at the meeting of the caste in the
</p>
<p>35
</p>
<p>Oart, and if any arrangement had been made to furnish tivjde persons who m'ght give
</p>
<p>evidence in the Supreme Court on the side of the Safya Prasask and against the
</p>
<p>Mnharaj. I said, before this arrangement was made they ought to have made an
</p>
<p>arrangement to prevent the Maharaj committing adultery. Dyal said, ' I am aware
</p>
<p>what the Maharaj does, but if any arrangement to prevent his doing so were made
</p>
<p>now, the Maharaj would lose his cause.' Dyal then informed me that two or three
</p>
<p>private meetings had taken place before the 6th ; he said that one meeting had taken
</p>
<p>place at Byculla, and another at Gumma Ramjee's place, and that a writing had been
</p>
<p>drawn up to the effect that no one should give evidence in favor of the printer or
</p>
<p>publisher of the Satj/a Prakash. He said that a third meeting had taken place at
</p>
<p>Chimun Lalljee's temple. Dyal said he was present at those meetings, and he men-
</p>
<p>tioned the names of other persons who he said were there. He mentioned as being
</p>
<p>present at the meeting at Byculla the names of Goculdass Lilladhur, Adut Kirpal,
</p>
<p>Bhugvvanjee Dw^rkadass, and others. He did not mention the names of the persons
</p>
<p>present at Chimun Lalljee's but said they were all there. By that I understood there
</p>
<p>were many persons, 75 or 100. Goculdass Tezpal was present all this time while Dyal
</p>
<p>was speaking, and Goculdass said that some arrangement ought to be made to prevent the
</p>
<p>immoral practices of the j\Iaharaj. I said to Dyal, if you had received a summons, you
</p>
<p>should speak the truth. He said, ' I will tell an untruth for the sake of religion, and the
</p>
<p>other 10,000 persons who have signed will do the same.' I said, ' If you had received
</p>
<p>a summons as I have received it in the libel case of Judoonathjee Maharaj vs. Karsandass
</p>
<p>Mooljee ?' Muthooradass Lowjee's name was mentioned. Dyal said that Mathooradass was
</p>
<p>assisting Karsandass Mooljee. Dyal said that those who gave evidence against the Mahraraj
</p>
<p>would be turned out of caste. I am on good terms with the defendants  particularly with
</p>
<p>Luckmidass Damjee.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Barton.  " Goculdass was present when the witness had the
</p>
<p>conversation with Dyal Jairaz. I wrote to Mr. Forjett about the meeting."
</p>
<p>(3.) William Henry Crawford examined.  " I am a Solicitor of this Court. I saw
</p>
<p>the prosecutor one day at the police court, and I believe the Magistrate saw him also.
</p>
<p>When I went to the window, the street was as full as it could be. I saw the prosecutor
</p>
<p>hustled about in the crowd, and saw him take refuge in a house on the opposite side of
</p>
<p>the street.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined : "I saw some of the defendants in Court. I can't say I saw any of
</p>
<p>them touch him."

<p>(4.) Hurjeecun Jivraz, examined.  " I am a Bhattia, and a mehta in the service of
</p>
<p>Lukmidass Goculdass & Co. I remember a meeting of our caste on the 6th of September
</p>
<p>last. I attended that meeting. I arrived there at about five o'clock. I saw all the defen-
</p>
<p>dants there  they were all there when I arrived. I went away about eight o'clock, or a
</p>
<p>quarter to eight. Proceedings commenced at about a quarter before six, or six o'clock.
</p>
<p>Goculdass and others called a Brahamin, Jetta, thanaye. Goculdass said, ' Jetta, come here !*
</p>
<p>Goculdass was sitting in a shed. Jetta stood up. Goculdass said to Jetta. ' Tell these
</p>
<p>people that no one slioiild make any objection here. Xo one shall make speeches. Those
</p>
<p>who want to sign, sign ! Those who do not, need not sign !' That was all. Jetta told
</p>
<p>that to the people. Where the Setts were sitting carpets were spread. The defendants and
</p>
<p>about twenty-five or fifty others were sitting on the carpets. About 2,000 or 3 000 persons
</p>
<p>were present. Of those sitting on the carpet, twelve or fifteen besides the defendants were
</p>
<p>Setts. The floor was an even floor all round, and a way in the middle to go on
</p>
<p>to the raised floor. About 1,500 or 1,700 persons were sitting on the oatla.
</p>
<p>About 500 or 700 were sitting below. Mooljee and Damjee were going about
</p>
<p>arranging for the audience. Mooljee and Damjee are not Setts. A book was read out by
</p>
<p>Adut Kirpall. Goculdass said to him, " Adut, read out of this book," and Adut read. I
</p>
<p>heard some part of what was read, and some I did not hear [Mr. Bayley objected to the
</p>
<p>admission of this hearsay evidence. The Court said it was admissible. It did not matter
</p>
<p>whether the matter was written or spoken.] I heard that those who were of opinion that
</p>
<p>the commentary on Goculnathjee's verse was correct should not sign ; and that those who were
</p>
<p>of opinion that it was not correct should sign ; and that those who did not sign should be punished
</p>
<p>by the caste. Canjee Shamjee also was reading from a paper, and I heard him say, ' If
</p>
<p>any one gives evidence in favour of the printer, he will be punished by the caste.' Can-
</p>
<p>jee said, ' If any one does not sign this he will be excommunicated.' Cries outside
</p>
<p>' Sign ; sign ! affix your signatures,' I heard. After the reading was finished the book
</p>
<p>was handed to sign. People were told to sign then. It was said that no one should leave
</p>
<p>the meeting without signing. Every one who loved his religion would sign, was also said.
</p>
<p>Mooljee and Damjee said, " Brothers, affix your signatures." Then people began to put their
</p>
<p>signatures. I saw nobody leave after signing, I left without signing. I don't know who signed
</p>
<p>the book first. I saw Goculdass sign, Lukmidass, Adut, Ragoo and others took the signatures.
</p>
<p>All the defendants assisted in it, some were standing with ink, and some with pen. People were
</p>
<p>coming into and going out of the oart. When I went near the gate I found a bench
</p>
<p>placed across in front, and Ragoo was sitting on it  Damjee and Mooljee were also there.
</p>
<p>Ragoo and Damjee said, ' Do not go away, brothers, without putting your signatures.'
</p>
<p>I attempted to go out, and Ragoo asked me if I had put my signature : I said, no.
</p>
<p>Then he asked me if I would sign to-morrow, and I said yes. I have never signed it.
</p>
<p>I told him I would sign it, because I wanted to go out ! After I got out of the gate I
</p>
<p>lingered for a short time outside, when I heard a person say, ' Shut the gates. Do not
</p>
<p>let any one go out !' and I saw the gates shut. Ragoo was distributing handbills. I was
</p>
<p>going to take one from Ragoo, when a man present gave me one. I read a portion of
</p>
<p>that, and then put it by. Afterwards I gave the handbill to Luckmidass. [Mr. Barton

<p>said the handbill could not be put in as evidence against the defendants unless the hand-
</p>
<p>bill was signed by, or contained the names of some one of them. Mr. Barton cited authority
</p>
<p>for that argument. Mr. Dunbar said that when the case was before the Magistrate he
</p>
<p>(Mr. Dunbar) had offered one in evidence, and the Magistrate had refused to admit it
</p>
<p>notwithstanding he (Mr. Dunbar) quoted the Queen vs. O'Connell. The Magistrate held
</p>
<p>its identity must be proved before it could be read. His Lordship said he could not
</p>
<p>admit the justness of such a ruling. It would be well to have the handbill put in. Mr.
</p>
<p>Anstey said there were tsvo notices. He read them to the Court and they were put in
</p>
<p>as evidence.]

<p>PUBLIC NOTICE.
</p>
<p>All the Bhatia Setts and all the Chief men among the Vaishnavs are informed
</p>
<p>as follows : At present iShri Judunathjee Maharai has brought an action of libel
</p>
<p>against Karsandass ]\Iooljee. This man has written in his Satiia Prakash as follows : 
</p>
<p>" Eefore one has himself enjoyed her, he should make over even his wedded wife to
</p>
<p>the Gusaijee Maharaj, and he should also make over to him his sons and daughters.
</p>
<p>One is to use (one's wife) after having offered her to the Gusaijee Maharaj subsequently
</p>
<p>to marriage and even before enjoying her himself. In this manner Shri Goculnathjee
</p>
<p>has made a comment on the work treating of the connection with Brahma.* And
</p>
<p>accordingly the Maharajas enjoy the tender maidens, wives and daughters of their
</p>
<p>followers." In this manner it is written and published in the Satija Prrtkask. And
</p>
<p>in his plea to the action this man has also stated as follows : " In the year 1855
</p>
<p>the Bhatia community assembled together to make an arrangement about this matter :
</p>
<p>so that at the time of the trial, the evidence of those Chief m.en will be adduced."
</p>
<p>This is what we have heardf Therefore we make known to jiU our brethren that the
</p>
<p>community did not assemble on any day whatever to make any such arrangement as that
</p>
<p>mentioned above. Nor were any person's signatures affixed to any writing or paper
</p>
<p>to the effect of what is mentioned above. For different purposes other than what is
</p>
<p>mentioned above, the Chief men's signatures have been made on several occasions. The
</p>
<p>documents bearing these signatures are deposited with the leading seiias of the com-
</p>
<p>nmnity on behalf of the community. Therefore those who have made their signatures
</p>
<p>inform the setias here that some of the reformers with a view to support the above-
</p>
<p>mentioned statement are endeavouring to obtain from the leading setias the deposited
</p>
<p>documents bearing those signatures in order to produce them in Court in evidence in
</p>
<p>this cause. This is what we have heard. Therefore if this thing should come to pass,
</p>
<p>and if the persons with whom those documents are deposited should give them up,
</p>
<p>then the risk appertaining to that, shall be on the heads of those who shall give them
</p>
<p>up. This is the sole representation. The 4th September 1861.

</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT.
</p>
<p>Be it known to all the VaishnavsJ Mahajans of Cutch and Abharsa and Halar
</p>
<p>inclusive of all the Bhatyas, that the community of reformers that are opposed to
</p>
<p>(our) rehgion have made and are still making several sorts of incorrect, false, and
</p>
<p>immoral attacks in the newspapers against the persons of the shri Gosayis*| in Bombay.
</p>
<p>Therefore Goswami shri Jadunathji Brizruttonjee Maharaj^ has brought an action of
</p>
<p>libel in the Court against an editor of a newspaper and shri Eunchorji Maharaj also
</p>
<p>has sent a notice for bringing an action of libel, in consequence whereof the reformers
</p>
<p>have been thrown into great anxiety here, it being impossible to prove this case
</p>
<p>therefore the reformers with the view of compromising the case cf shri Kunshorji
</p>
<p>Maharaj have, it is rumoured here; sent a Bhatya from this place to [Mandavi that
</p>
<p>* [i. f. the Supreme. Being.) + {Meaning ihix is what we ham heard that he ha^ allege'^.
</p>
<p>X (Won^hippm oj Ynnlirm.) I (Great Men) \ (Wgh VrieH.)
</p>
<p>38
</p>
<p>he might by making some kind of request to the Vahooji* Maharaj of shri Chotaji
</p>
<p>Maharaj and by making false representations (to her) obtain in writing a document
</p>
<p>from the Vahooji Maharaj and produce that document as evidence in the Court and
</p>
<p>that he might by making a request to Runshorji Maharaj and hy making false
</p>
<p>representations to him obtain some way or other a document (from liini) to comprnmise
</p>
<p>the case. Such is the intention cf tlie reformers. We have heard that they have for this
</p>
<p>purpose sent a man from this place; therefore the Yaishnavs comnmnity of this filace
</p>
<p>recommend all to and tliis representation paper made to the effert, that if this
</p>
<p>account be true, no documents of any kind whatsoever should he pissed to the man
</p>
<p>belonging to the reformers, any one who may hear this information should request shri
</p>
<p>Runshorji Maharaj and the Vahooji Maharaj of shri Chotaji not to pass any
</p>
<p>document through mistake or forgetfulness. It is essentially necessary for the Bhatya
</p>
<p>Mahajans of Cutch, Halar, and Abhrasa to make arrangements (or adopt measures)
</p>
<p>in respect of this matter. This is the prayer.
</p>
<p>Written by the Vaishnavs of Bombay whose compliments be pleased to read.

</p>
<p>W^itness cross-examined by Mr. Barton  " I have read through the handbill. I believe
</p>
<p>the handbill correctly contained the object of the meeting.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Bayley :  " I would not know the book again if I was to see it. It was bound
</p>
<p>up like this one now shown me (a foolscap -sized day book is produced in Court.) I heard
</p>
<p>Adut Kirpal read from the book."
</p>
<p>(5.) Khuttaoo Liidha, examined by Mr. Dunbar :  I am a Bhattia. I deal in cotton.
</p>
<p>I attended the meeting. In the morning of the day when the meeting was held the than-
</p>
<p>naye went round and warned the people. I had heard at Jewunjee's temple that the meeting
</p>
<p>was to be held. It was a matter of notoriety among the caste members that the meeting
</p>
<p>of the 6th of September was to have been held, and the object of the meeting was also a
</p>
<p>matter of notoriety. Some members of the caste knew that some secret meetings had been
</p>
<p>previously held. The object of the meeting was a matter of notoriety throughout the caste.
</p>
<p>The object, which was a matter of notoriety, was to make an arrangement respecting the
</p>
<p>Ubel case, and to prevent persons from giving evidence against the Maharaj. I met two of
</p>
<p>the defendants  Dyal Jairaz and Bhugwanjee Dwarkadass  before the meeting in the oart
</p>
<p>took place. It was about one or two o'clock in the afternoon. I met them at Jewraz
</p>
<p>Balloo's place of business  in Bazar Gate Street, within the Fort. Eight or ten persons

</p>
<p>were silting there  Goculdass Tezpal, Khuttaoo Muccoondjee, my two brothers, and others.
</p>
<p>Dyal Jairaz spoke to others about the meeting. Khuttaoo Muccoondjee asked Dyal Jairaz
</p>
<p>why the people were going to assemble to-day. Dyal and Bhugwanjee both spoke, and said
</p>
<p>it was to make up an arrangement. Khuttaoo Muccoondjee asked Dyal Jairaz if any arrange-
</p>
<p>ment was to be made about the Maharaj committing adultery, and Dyal said it was true
</p>
<p>the Maharaj committed adultery, but if we made any noise about it now, the
</p>
<p>Maharaj would lose his cause in Court : he said we would speak to the Maharaj about
</p>
<p>* {Wife of Maharaj)
</p>
<p>39
</p>
<p>that afterwards. Cyal said, ' if we are called to give evidence, and all put upon our oaths,
</p>
<p>we will state that the Maharaj does not commit adultery.' I went to the meeting at
</p>
<p>five o'clock in the evening. (His Lordship said as the case would likely last sometime
</p>
<p>it was not advisable to sit longer. The Jury were allowed to retire to their homes for
</p>
<p>the night.)
</p>
<p>Friday, \dtk December.
</p>
<p>Witness continued  " When I went there, there were 200 or 300 persons present.
</p>
<p>Several persons came afterwards. The defendants were all there when I arrivt^d. Damjee
</p>
<p>Heera and Mooljee Morarjee made people sit. Before the proceedings commenced,
</p>
<p>Gociildass Liiladhiir, Dyal Jairaz, and Bhugwanjee Dwarkadass went aside and consulted
</p>
<p>together. Proceedings commenced at about half-past six o'clock. After they went aside and
</p>
<p>consulted together I saw a book with Bagoo Shamjee. It was about half an hour after.
</p>
<p>He took the book from a cloth in which it was wrapped up. Goculdass said, ' Read
</p>
<p>this to the meeting.' Adut read it. I was as far as from the witness-box to Mr. Barton
</p>
<p>(about five paces). I could hear what was read. I know the purport of it. [Mr. Bayley
</p>
<p>objected to witness stating the purport of what was in the book. The book itself could he
</p>
<p>produced. Mr Anstey said he must reply to the objection with the same statement he had
</p>
<p>made use of yesterday. They had no means of knowing whether the bock produced in Court
</p>
<p>was the book or not. Mr. Anstey believed it to be a forgery. The book was not produced
</p>
<p>in the Police Court. Mr. Bayley said he only took the objection, and wished to continue the
</p>
<p>objection. His learned friend had no right to let the jury know in an indirect manner that the
</p>
<p>book was not produced at the Police Court. Mr. Anstey said, Mr. Bayley had himself yesterday
</p>
<p>mooted that question, and had given unsworn evidence on behalf of his clients. Objection recorded
</p>
<p>and overruled.] So far as I remember, it said the commentary on the verse of Goculnathjee
</p>
<p>by the printer or publisher was incorrect ; and those who may not consider it incorrect
</p>
<p>will not sign this book, while those who may consider it incorrect will sign this book : and
</p>
<p>those wlio consider their religion is the true religion should sign this book. And those who
</p>
<p>may consider that the present Maharajahs do not commit adultery should sign the book.
</p>
<p>And, as for the printers and publishers, and their abettors and aiders, they will be called
</p>
<p>to account according to law. They did not say what law, but I understood it to mean the
</p>
<p>law of the caste. The members of the caste were to call them to account, as I understood.
</p>
<p>That is all I remember, as it was a long time ago. After that had been read Canjee
</p>
<p>Shamjee made a speech. Canjee was standing behind Adut Kirpal when he spoke, and
</p>
<p>about five paces distant from me. When Canjee was speaking he had a paper in his

</p>
<p>hand. Canjee said, ' Our religion is the true one. and our religion inculcates bathing, the
</p>
<p>worship of the gods, and pilgrimages to holy places. These are unholy comments upon
</p>
<p>our religion ; and whoever may assist those printers will be punished by the caste.' Then
</p>
<p>Can ee sat down. After that Adut Kirpal called the crier, Jetta, and said to him, * Do
</p>
<p>you ask the members of the caste whether they approve this speech, or not ! And whether
</p>
<p>they would sign the book after the Setts had signed- it ?' The majority said ' yes, we
</p>
<p>will sign.' Then the crier put another question to the meeting. TTc said ' it will be
</p>
<p>40
</p>
<p>necessary to write letters abroad, and will you assemble again if desired by the Setts ?"
</p>
<p>That was by the direction of Adut Kirpal. Then the meeting approved, and said they
</p>
<p>would attend. Luckmidass Damjee or Goculdass Lilladliur signed first, then all the defen-
</p>
<p>dants signed ; other leading Setts then signed. Then Kagoo Shamjee took the book and
</p>
<p>went to the gateway  Damjee Heera and Mooljee Morarjee went with him. I think the
</p>
<p>gate was open then  it was shut afterwards. The gate was not entirely shut  a wicket was
</p>
<p>left open. They were taking signatures. Kagoo Shamjee was sitting on a bench placed opposite
</p>
<p>the gateway. The bench was not before the gate when I went in. I did not see who
</p>
<p>placed it there. It was quite close to the gate. Those who signed the book, went out.
</p>
<p>Only one person at a time could go through the wicket. Ragoo and the two defendants,
</p>
<p>who were sitting close to him said, those who consider their religion the true religion should
</p>
<p>not leave without signing. For three or four days, till the 10th of the month, signatures
</p>
<p>were taken on the verandah at Goculdass Lilladhur's. Members of my caste signed the
</p>
<p>book there ; some men, and some boys. A loy who lives in the house where I live, ten
</p>
<p>years of age, said he signed it. After the tkannaye put the question at the meeting, no
</p>
<p>one raised any objection. All remained silent. I was present at Walkeshwur at a con-
</p>
<p>versation between Goculdass Tezpal and Dyal Jairaz. I was not near enough to hear well.
</p>
<p>Euttonsee Callianjee was there. Corjee Ludha, Callianjee Ludha and Khuttaoo Muccoondjee
</p>
<p>were also present. Euttonsee Callianjee and I v/ere sitting apart. We were conversing
</p>
<p>together and looking at some object.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Barton.  " That object was a Bhattia going into the house
</p>
<p>of a courtezan near by. I am a Cutchee, and not a Halaee. I did say before the police
</p>
<p>that the Halaies had excommunicated me. There was no leather on the bench near the
</p>
<p>door. It was made of wood, and those who sat upon it must know whether it was soft or hard.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Bayley.  "I did not sign the book. I saw the book well when it was open.
</p>
<p>Lights were lighted at the time the book was read. The book was a. book bound like this
</p>
<p>now shown me (same as described by a former witness). I heard all that was read. (Mr,
</p>
<p>Bayley examined the witness upon a paper held by himself).
</p>
<p>Ee-examined.  " I worship the Maharaj as a spiritual guide. [Mr. Anstey asked that
</p>
<p>the document which Mr. Bayley had examined upon should be put in for the purpose
</p>
<p>of re-examination upon. Mr. Anstey cited a case to the point. Mr. Bayley objected
</p>
<p>to it. He submitted that IMr. Anstey had no right to it. The case cited by Mr.
</p>
<p>Anstey was not to the point. Mr. Anstey said that if the learned gentleman
</p>
<p>chose to cross-examine from his brief, lie (Mr. Anstey) was entitled to see the

<p>brief. Mr. Anstey cited Taylor in support of his argument. His Lordship was under the
</p>
<p>impression that the prosecution were entitled to see the document. He would look into the
</p>
<p>authorities, and in the meantime examination should be resumed.] Adut, when he read the
</p>
<p>paper, said that religion, religious preceptors, and reputation, were to be protected ; but I
</p>
<p>don't remember if he said how. As Adut read I understood him to say that the printers
</p>
<p>accused the Maharaj ahs of adultery with our wives and daughters, and that there was
</p>
<p>nothing of that kind in our religion. The meaning of the printers was said to be this :
</p>
<p>that the wives of the members of the caste, should be offered up to the Maharaj before
</p>
<p>being enjoyed by us. Our caste proceed against persons offending by the law of the caste :
</p>
<p>the chief law is expulsion from the caste. T can't say that book shown me by Mr.
</p>
<p>Bayley was the book I saw at the oart.
</p>
<p>41
</p>
<p>By the Court.  " The Sett is an hereditary title. Among the Bhattias Jewraz Balloo
</p>
<p>is considered the principal Sett, as his forefathers were chief Setts."
</p>
<p>(6.) Cliarhs Forjctt, examined.  " In my official capacity (Deputy Commissioner of
</p>
<p>Police) I received a letter. I produce it. I acted upon it. In consequence of something
</p>
<p>in the letter I issued au order to a constable to be in attendance with a small party of
</p>
<p>policemen to see that no disturbance took place. I think the prosecutor was present when the
</p>
<p>letter was delivered. The letter was signed by Luckmidass Khimjee, Muthooradass Lowjee
</p>
<p>and two others. I was not applied to, to the best of my recollection, to take the chair at
</p>
<p>that meeting. I passed by the place in the evening, ascertained that everything was quiet
</p>
<p>and went away."
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Barton  "I did not hear that any threat or intimidation was
</p>
<p>offered there."
</p>
<p>By Mr. Bay ley.  " I saw Goculdass Lilladhur with reference to the meeting, and told
</p>
<p>him that he had better be careful and not let his party create any disturbance. Goculdass
</p>
<p>said that there was no intention on the part of his men to create a breach of the peace.
</p>
<p>He said the object of the meeting was to ascertain who were the Maharajah's friends, and
</p>
<p>who were not It was at five, half-past five, or a quarter to six, when I rode past.
</p>
<p>I don't think I have any Bhattia sepoys. The gate was open when I went by."
</p>
<p>(7.) George Gahac/an, examined  " I am a constable of Tolice, and do duty at the
</p>
<p>Picquet. In consequence of instructions from Mr. Forjett I went to the meeting on the
</p>
<p>6th of September, at about half-past six o'clock. I took two sepoys inside with me, and
</p>
<p>lefl a sepoy and a trooper outside. The two sepoys I took inside, were put outside by
</p>
<p>the request of Dam.ee Heera. He said there was no tear of a row. I recognize eight of
</p>
<p>the defendants as being present. Six of the defendants were sitting on a bench. Damjee
</p>
<p>Heera and Eagoo Shamjee were walking about. Goculdass Lilladhur appeared to be at
</p>
<p>the head of the meeting. Proceedings commenced immediately a'ter I went in. Jetta
</p>
<p>called the meeting to order  told them to keep silence. After that a book was read by
</p>
<p>Adut Kirpall ; the book was handed from a bench where they were all seated. I don't
</p>
<p>know which of the defendants handed the book. After the defendants signed the book,
</p>
<p>people standing about came and signed. Then it appeared to me an objection was taken
</p>
<p>to signatures being taken there at the bench, and the book was taken outside the gate.
</p>
<p>I went out about eight o'clock. The gate was then shut  the wicket was open.
</p>
<p>Signatures were then being taken by Ragoo Shamjee and Damjee Heera outside the gate.
</p>
<p>The people who had the book were standing at the corner of the gateway. People, I

<p>think, might have passed out behind them without being seen. I had a conversation with
</p>
<p>Eagoo Shamjee and Damjee Heera. Eagoo said the meeting was to ascertain who was
</p>
<p>for and who was against the Maharaj, Eagoo said those who liked might sign, and those
</p>
<p>who did not like, need not sign. This conversation was before the meeting commenced.
</p>
<p>I was intimate with Eagoo before that. Damjee said the same as Eagoo, and added that
</p>
<p>there was an action of lihel in Court on account of some of the caste. Also he said that
</p>
<p>there were missionaries mixed up in their caste the same as there were in ours. Then
</p>
<p>Eagoo asked me to show him the paper I had got from Mr. Forjett, as he wanted to see
</p>
<p>the signatures attached to it. I had the letter with me, but did not show it to him.
</p>
<p>Handbills were distributed in the street by Eagoo Shamjee. The wicket is about two feet
</p>
<p>and a half wide. I ara not sufficiently acquainted with the language to tell what was
</p>
<p>6
</p>
<p>42
</p>
<p>read or spoken. They spoke in Cutchee, while they read from the paper in Guzerati. I am
</p>
<p>of opinion that the object of the meeting was disclosed both in the paper and book, more in the
</p>
<p>paper than in the book as, after the former was read, they all shouted. There was no
</p>
<p>shouting after the reading from the book. I do not think all the persons present could hear
</p>
<p>what was read, only those immediately round the spot, from the low tone of voice in which
</p>
<p>it was read. I heard the words "contrary to caste" and that "the Maharaja has been
</p>
<p>served with a summons" read from the paper, which made me think that the, most important
</p>
<p>of the two. The paper was a slip about six inches wide about eighteen inches long, and
</p>
<p>light yellow paper. The book was half-bound.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined  " I should think there were 2000 people present. I ventured there
</p>
<p>without any fear. So far as I could see there was no intimidation. I judged the people
</p>
<p>were anxious to sign it, from their action. I saw no force used, or pressure of any kind."
</p>
<p>(8) Goculdass Tespal, examined by Mr. Anstey  "I am a merchant, a justice of
</p>
<p>the peace, and a chief Sett of the Bhattia caste, and reside near the Bazaar Gate in the
</p>
<p>Fort. I am one of the founders of a school at which Bhattia children are educated. On
</p>
<p>the 5th of September, I heard from Dyal Jairaz that a meeting was to take place. I was
</p>
<p>at a fair at Walkeshwur when I heard that. I asked Dyal what all the noise was about,
</p>
<p>and he said, ' Let's go aside and speak together.' Then we went to the dkurrumsalla,
</p>
<p>where Khuttao Muccundjee and others were. Dyal then said, ' Bhugwanjee has received
</p>
<p>a note from Goculdass Lilladhur.' Dyal said that the letter called for a meeting at once.
</p>
<p>I asked what was the subject, and Dyal said, it refers to the commentary of Goculnathjee
</p>
<p>and to the action between Judoonathjee Maharaj vs. Karsandass Mooljee. I asked Dyal
</p>
<p>if he had referred to any Shastree, and he said he had not. He said fifteen or twenty
</p>
<p>persons had assembled at Gumma Ramjee's and mentioned the names of three or four of
</p>
<p>them. He said that Canjee Shamjee read a paper and after that said some arrangement
</p>
<p>should be made to prevent our religion from being upset. He said that a meeting took
</p>
<p>place that day at Chimun Laljee's temple, and that he with others went there. Bhug-
</p>
<p>wanjee sent for Goculdass Lilladhur, inviting him to come there with his other friends.
</p>
<p>Dyal mentioned the names of Goculdass, Lukmidass, Adut, Ragoo, Canjee, Bhugwanjee,
</p>
<p>and others as being present. Dyal said a discussion took place there regarding the comment-
</p>
<p>ary on Goculnathjee 's verse, and that it was resolved a full meeting should be held.
</p>
<p>" The following morning about 7 o'clock I was sitting at the shop of Jewraz Balloo
</p>
<p>with Khuttao Muccoondjee, when Jetta, the crier, came there, and said Luckmidass,
</p>
<p>Petamber and two others had desired him to ask my permission for a caste meeting.

</p>
<p>He came two or three times that morning. I did not give my consent. I am in a
</p>
<p>position that my consent should be obtained. Bhugwanjee and Dyal came to my house at
</p>
<p>half past twelve o'clock, and we three went to the house of Jewraj Balloo. Khuttao
</p>
<p>Muccoondjee came there. We went upstairs ; I asked Bhugwanjee what the object of the
</p>
<p>meeting was, and he said it was about the commentary of Goculnathjee, and a paper was
</p>
<p>to be drawn out, and the commentary refuted (or falsified). The writing was to be
</p>
<p>prepared in the Mahjun oart. Djral asked me what my opinion was. He said, ' you
</p>
<p>have received a summons on the part of Karsandass Mooljee. What evidence will you
</p>
<p>give ?' I said I would say nothing that was false. Dyal then said, ' It is true that the
</p>
<p>Maharaj commits adultery, but as this question is connected with religion it would be as
</p>
<p>well to say nothing about it.' Bhugwanjee also said that. Dyal said, ' Those who as-
</p>
<p>BiBt KarsandasB will be punished by the caste.* I did not attend the meeeting. On the
</p>
<p>4S
</p>
<p>following day I saw Dyal again in my office. He came of his own accord. I asked him
</p>
<p>what resolutions were passed at the meeting of the 6th. He said a writing had been
</p>
<p>prepared, and it was written there that if any one should give evidence for the publisher
</p>
<p>he should be punished by the caste. I said ' Pid you assemble in Goculdass Lilladhur's
</p>
<p>oart, at Matoonga ?' He said, ' No in Goculdass Lilladhur's oart at BycuUa.' Dyal said
</p>
<p>there were fifteen or twenty persons at that meeting. He mentioned the names of some
</p>
<p>of the defendants as being present. He said that Purbhoodass brought the plea put in by
</p>
<p>Karsandass in the libel action and explained it ; and said that our religion was about to
</p>
<p>be destroyed, and that no one must go and give evidence on behalf of Karsandass. Dyal
</p>
<p>did not say on what day that meeting took place. It was on the 7th that I heard of it.
</p>
<p>I saw Luckmidass Khimjee at my office on the 7th He came there while Dyal and I
</p>
<p>were speaking together. At the meeting at Walkeshwur Khuttao Ludha was present.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Barton  " I was fined seven or eight years ago by the
</p>
<p>Magistrate for making a false return of carriages. The prosecutor of this case was a school-
</p>
<p>master employed by me. When at Walkeshwur, and we were conversing, Khuttao went
</p>
<p>to look at a holy woman ! That " holy woman" lived in a house opposite. I never went
</p>
<p>to look at that " holy woman" myself. I don't know the character of that woman. Khuttao
</p>
<p>went to see who that Bhattia was that went into the house where the woman was. I have
</p>
<p>known the Maharajas committed adultery for seventeen or eighteen years past ; and yet I
</p>
<p>worship them. No man can be expelled from caste unless a majority of the caste decides
</p>
<p>he shall be. The nine defendants have not the power of expelling me from the caste.
</p>
<p>There are only two Setts among the defendants.
</p>
<p>Re-examined  " My 7nehta appeared for me when I was fined."
</p>
<p>(9) Hemraj Khetsey, examined  " I am a broker, and live in the Fort. I attended a
</p>
<p>meeting of the caste on the 6th of September. I arrived there about seven o'clock. The
</p>
<p>nine defendants were there. Adut Kirpall read from a book. I did not hear well. I do
</p>
<p>not remember what it was Canjee Shamjee read from a paper, and after he had finished
</p>
<p>reading, he said, " Brethren will question persons who give evidence for the publisher."
</p>
<p>After that the crier was called. I have not been subpoenaed as a witness in the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court. I have not been threatened in case I give evidence in the Supreme Court. All
</p>
<p>that was stated was, that he who assists the printer or publisher will be questioned by the
</p>
<p>brethren.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bayley  " I did not sign the book. I was not asked to sign
</p>
<p>it. I was at the meeting the whole time. I remember a part of what was read.  A

</p>
<p>than to express an opinion upon the commentary. I heard no threat.
</p>
<p>Re-examined  " I was about thirty paces distant from the spot when the paper was
</p>
<p>read "
</p>
<p>("10 ) Nanjee Morarjee examined by Mr. Anstey  " I am a Muccadum residing in
</p>
<p>Hunnooman Lane. I was present at the meeting of the 6th of September. I was aware
</p>
<p>that meeting was to be held one or two days before. I was aware that handbills had
</p>
<p>been issued on the 4th of September, I saw one of them ; I should recognize them. One
</p>
<p>of those handbills (one produced) is not the one distributed on the 6th of September.
</p>
<p>(Witness here recognized a second handbill shown him as one of those disti-ibuted on the
</p>
<p>6th September. It was read to him by the Interpreter, and witness said it was the same)
</p>
<p>44
</p>
<p>Kagoo distributed ten or twenty, and said the rest were to go to Cutch." (The official
</p>
<p>translation of this handbill was read, to the effect that all people in Cutch should take
</p>
<p>care and communicate no intelligence to the reformers' emissaries who had been sent to
</p>
<p>Cutch to obtain information.)
</p>
<p>(11.) Purshoturn EemraJ called by the prosecuting counsel, and examined by Mr.
</p>
<p>Bayley.  " I am a poor man and I cannot give any evidence. I was greatly alarmed, and
</p>
<p>could not give evidtnce. I don't want to name anybody. I am very much afraid. I
</p>
<p>don't want to name anybody.
</p>
<p>By the Court  " I am a Bhattia; The whole world abuse me.
</p>
<p>By Mr. Anstey  " I do know some, but I am afraid to tell what I know."
</p>
<p>(12.) Bhanjee Bhurriinisey, called by prosecuting counsel for cross-examination.
</p>
<p>This witness was not cross-examined.
</p>
<p>[On account of the very great confusion in Court, which the Court crier found it
</p>
<p>impossible to repress, his Lordship was compelled to call upon the Deputy Sheriff, consta-
</p>
<p>bles, and others, to shew increased activity. Quiet was very soon restored. The Court
</p>
<p>was densely crowded, and made the duty of keeping order consequently not a light one.]
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey, when quiet had been restored, read the defendant's answer in the libel
</p>
<p>action, which revealed the most abominable doctrines ever heard of as guiding the Bhattia
</p>
<p>caste, or that sect of it to which the conspirators belonged. Mr. Anstey read for more
</p>
<p>than half an hour, when he was stopped by the Court. Sufficient was read to inform the
</p>
<p>jury of the materiality of the pleas.
</p>
<p>(13.) John Doming Rozarto, a clerk in the Prothonotory's Office was called, and
</p>
<p>swore to the answer.
</p>
<p>(14.) Pestonjee Bazonjee, examined  " I am a clerk in the office of Messrs. Acland
</p>
<p>and Prentis. I delivered the pleas put in by defendants in the libel action on the 15th
</p>
<p>of August."
</p>
<p>(15.) Hurrychund Bhanjee, examined  " I am a clerk of Messrs. Acland and Prentis.
</p>
<p>I served a summons upon Jivanjee Maharaj before the 6 th of September."
</p>
<p>(16.) Kessow Bhowo, a clerk in the Supreme Court, examined  " The cause of Jud-
</p>
<p>oonathjee Maharaj vs. Karsandass ]\Iooljee is set down for trial."

<p>Mr. Anstey said that was the case for the prosecution.
</p>

</p>
<p>jury ? His Lordship said there was.
</p>
<p>45
</p>
<p>Saturday, I'it/i December.
</p>
<p>(The Court-room was more carefully guarded than on previous days, and but few
</p>
<p>natives wrere admitted. The considerable number of European gentlemen in Court manifested
</p>
<p>the great interest which has been felt in this case )
</p>
<p>Mr. R. B. Barton, on behalf of two of the defendants, addressed the jury in a most
</p>
<p>able and eloquent speech. They had heard this great Bhattia case to the end, so far, as
</p>
<p>the prosecution was concerned, and it now became his duty as counsel for some of the
</p>
<p>prisoners to address them upon this most unheard of and perplexing prosecution perplexing
</p>
<p>as to what defence could be made to charges in support of which little if any evidence had
</p>
<p>been adduced and that little so forced and perverted as to create a difficulty even by its
</p>
<p>own obscurity. The jury must be aware of the extraordinary interest the case had excited,
</p>
<p>and still continued to excite amongst the native community of this vast and densely populated
</p>
<p>town ; and that for reasons that must be obvious to every one  first, on account of the
</p>
<p>novelty of the accusation, this being the first case of the kind ever presented before a
</p>
<p>Bombay jury ; secondly, from the known and well established respectability of the accused ;
</p>
<p>and, thirdly, from the nature of the charges trumped against his clients, and laid out in
</p>
<p>that cloudy and overgrown indictment they had all seen in the hands of the Clerk of the
</p>
<p>Crown, when the defendants were arraigned. Mr. Barton did not consider that there would
</p>
<p>be any difficulty in upsetting all those charges, or that there was any thing in them worthy
</p>
<p>of remark, conspicuous and remarkable as they were in nothing but their vagueness, and
</p>
<p>peculiarly in their want of precision, unworthy of comment, were it not for the dangerous
</p>
<p>precedent sought to be established by the prosecution should a conviction be obtained. The
</p>
<p>opening address of the learned counsel for the prosecution in itself betrayed a knowledge of
</p>
<p>the weakness of the case ; for instead of giving some insight into the case he intended to
</p>
<p>present, he (Mr. Anstey) rolled about like a dismasted ship in a heavy sea reaching at one
</p>
<p>point ancient Rome, then modern Italy, back to England in the time of our Harry the
</p>
<p>Eighth as he called him, fit man to name in a case connected with so much blasphemy
</p>
<p>and filth ; and then with a peculiar and eccentric roll we were taken, said Mr. Barton, to
</p>
<p>Strange's Hindu Law, and the horrors of excommunication, seasoning his weak and tottering
</p>
<p>statements with grains of Attic salt and classic pepper, utterly forgetful of the charge of
</p>
<p>conspiracy, most carefully kept in the background ; and when they were at the end of that
</p>
<p>opening address as far as proof was concerned there they were now. The men for whom
</p>
<p>he (Mr. Barton) appeared were charged with an infamous and wicked crime, if it were
</p>
<p>legally crime at all, and he trusted the jury would, as men who had a solemn duty to

</p>
<p>discharge, look carefully into the case with all its bearings, motives, and peculiarities, ere
</p>
<p>they ventured to return a verdict of guilty against all or any of the prisoners, now for the
</p>
<p>first time in their lives arraigned at the bar of a criminal court. The case he would
</p>
<p>endeavour to make on behalf of his clients would be a simple one because it would be a true
</p>
<p>one. The learned counsel said this prosecution was not got up for the purpose of advancing
</p>
<p>public morality, but for the purpose of creating an unfair and dishonest prejudice against
</p>
<p>the plaintiffs in the action now pending on the plea side of the Court, and to create a
</p>
<p>money interest on behalf of the defendant in that action and the prosecutor in this most
</p>
<p>miserable and oppressive " prosecution." Before entering on the demerits of this extraordinary
</p>
<p>case, Mr. Barton said he could not help animadverting upon the course pursued by the
</p>
<p>prosecution from first to last, and he considered that means had been used and intimidation
</p>
<p>shadowed forth by application to the Court to set aside a few seats for members of the
</p>
<p>46
</p>
<p>caste to which prisoner belonged, and application for a force of European police to keep
</p>
<p>order. The effect of this application, although apparently made in good faith, had had its
</p>
<p>effect, and the Court had never been half filled upon any day of this trial. He (Mr.
</p>
<p>Barton) protested against this Court being any but an open one to all Her Majesty's Indian
</p>
<p>subjects without distinction of creed or caste.
</p>
<p>His Lordship here interrupted the speaking, observing that the request preferred to
</p>
<p>the Deputy Con^.missioner of Police was simply to have a body of men to prevent the
</p>
<p>overcrowding of the Court. The request did not go beyond that.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barton continued  He said as long as he had life and power he would protest
</p>
<p>against a hole and corner conviction being obtained, and undue means of any kind being
</p>
<p>used to turn the machinery of this honorable Court into an instrument of torture. After
</p>
<p>some further comments on the conduct of the prosecution, and the nature of the evidence,
</p>
<p>Mr. Barton entered very fully into his own case, which was a statement of the meetings
</p>
<p>held since June 1858 to take into consideration the disgraceful publications in a Guzerati
</p>
<p>newspaper, the SiUia Prakash, against the Bhattia religion and community, and to adopt
</p>
<p>measures to prosecute the pubHshers and to have them punished by the laws of the land.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barton told the jury they were brought to give a verdict on the libel action pending on
</p>
<p>the plea side of this Court. The defendants had only done what they had a perfect right
</p>
<p>to do. Mr. Barton concluded his address with a very able appeal on behalf of his clients.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley, on behalf of six of the defendants, followed in a very able speech, holding
</p>
<p>the attention of the jury for nearly three hours. He stated what it was that constituted a
</p>
<p>conspiracy, and how the present trial was constituted. He argued that this trial could not
</p>
<p>be supported, and cited several passages from Smith's speech in the trial of O'Connell and
</p>
<p>seven others, in Dublin, in 1843, in support of the argument, passages which were laid
</p>
<p>down as good law. Such an indictment as this, Mr. Bayley said, was never before framed
</p>
<p> it was an old law indictment, {Russel on Crime). There was not a modern case like
</p>
<p>it. The defendants were indicted on a common law ofFence, and the learned counsel (Mr.
</p>
<p>Anstey) had asked the jury to look at the case through English spectacles. He (Mr.
</p>
<p>Bayley) said the case was without a parallel, and could not be so viewed. The people were
</p>
<p>a peculiar people, and the English would always be profoundly ignorant of their habits and
</p>
<p>modes of thought. The defendants, the learned gentleman would have the jury to bear in
</p>
<p>mind, were not the scum of the streets. The jury were trying the highest men in the
</p>
<p>Bhattia community  two of them the highest Setts of the caste ; and his learned friend's
</p>
<p>(Mr. Anstey 's) language, calling them " most ignorant and degraded," ought not to

</p>
<p>have been used. These men were living almost the same as they did centuries ago, so far
</p>
<p>as we knew ; and the English would never know more of them. This matter was wholly
</p>
<p>a caste matter, said the learned gentleman : the East India Company had always made it
</p>
<p>a point not to interfere with the natives in their religion and matters connected with it ;
</p>
<p>and the same freedom was held out to the natives by our present good and wise govern-
</p>
<p>ment. The learned counsel here entered into the history of the Indian Press from the
</p>
<p>time of the publication of the first newspaper in Bengal in 1780, when it was so closely
</p>
<p>guarded as to be but a mere receptacle of advertisements, fetes, balls, etc., down to a
</p>
<p>recent date when it first enjoyed and continued to enjoy the greatest freedom. But
</p>
<p>that freedom was not to use the press as a vehicle of private malice and unlimited abuse
</p>
<p>of the religion of a large and respectable community.
</p>
<p>The learned gentlemen called no witnesses on behalf of the defendants.
</p>
<p>47
</p>
<p>His Lordship", in summing up the case, made a few general observations upon
</p>
<p>the charge preferred against the defendants. The essence of conspiracy was a combination
</p>
<p>for an unlawful purpose, and it was immaterial whether or not the measures taken by the
</p>
<p>persons entering into such combination ensured, or were the best adapted to ensure, the
</p>
<p>object aimed at. The evident object in the present indictment was stated to be to obstruct
</p>
<p>the course of public justice, by preventing witnesses in a case pending in this Court from
</p>
<p>coming forward to give their evidence. The defendants were thus charged with unlawfully
</p>
<p>combining to defeat the administration of justice in this Court  in fact, to turn it into an
</p>
<p>instrument of injustice. In had been remarked by one of the brightest of English intellects
</p>
<p>that secr^sy was a necessary ingredient in a charge of conspiracy, and that where the
</p>
<p>proceedings were conducted openly they would not come under this office. Though this
</p>
<p>might be correct according to poetic justice. His Lordship, as an administrator of criminal
</p>
<p>law in this Court, felt bound to say that such a doctrine was not correct in criminal justice.
</p>
<p>The essence of conspiracy was combination, no matter if the object was pursued openly or
</p>
<p>secretly. Secrecy is not an essence of the charge. Much stress. His Lordship went on to
</p>
<p>say, had been laid upon the argument of counsel that the principles of English criminal
</p>
<p>justice could not rigidly be applied to the present case. In this opinion His Lordship could
</p>
<p>not agree : this was not a case in which the Maharaj of the Bhattias sought redress for any
</p>
<p>imputations cast upon his private character or upon his high office of spiritual guide and
</p>
<p>preceptor. This was an attempt in a combination, to turn into an instrument of in-justice the very
</p>
<p>tribunal for the adjudication of justice, to which the Maharaj himself had applied for redress,
</p>
<p>for imputations cast upon his honor and authority. And if the evidence satisfied the jury
</p>
<p>that these persons entered into the combination, as the agents of the Maharaj, they were
</p>
<p>amenable to the charge of conspiring to defeat public justice ; therefore the principles of
</p>
<p>English criminal law were as applicable to this as to any other case. There was this
</p>
<p>remark to be made, which did not apply to other criminal cases, viz., that the law held as
</p>
<p>liable to punishment all parties privy to the combination and its objects, though they might
</p>
<p>be present or absent at any particular meetings of the conspirators. In a case of this kind
</p>
<p>secondary evidence was admissible as to the object of the conspirators : the general effect
</p>
<p>produced upon the mind of a hearer by any speeches made or by extracts read from a
</p>
<p>book at the meeting, would be evidence as to the objects of the combination. With these
</p>
<p>and other general observations upon the nature of the charge. His Lordship proceeded to
</p>
<p>read the evidence in extenso, during which he observed that the language of the plea was
</p>
<p>perfectly unobjectionable when taking into consideration the occasion calling it forth. It was

</p>
<p>a false delicacy introduced only into modern society which named such articles in a bad
</p>
<p>b'ght. The truth is, said his Lordship, nothing less than hard terms will answer in des-
</p>
<p>cribing hard practices ; and in answer to a serious charge in a court of justice it is better
</p>
<p>to speak plain.
</p>
<p>The jury retired for deliberation at a quarter to 4 o'clock, and returned into Court at
</p>
<p>precisely half-past 4 o'clock with a verdict of GuiLTT.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey, as soon as the verdict was pronounced, appealed to the Court not to be
</p>
<p>too severe in the sentence. Justice has been vindicated, Mr. Anstey said, and the puny
</p>
<p>efforts of the defendants had failed. He (Mr. Anstey) would appeal to his Lordship, if he
</p>
<p>could consistently, not to go beyond the infliction of a fine on the defendants.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bay ley asked the Court to suspend judgment. He would move the full Court on
</p>
<p>some legal points.
</p>
<p>48
</p>
<p>The Sessions was accordingly adjourned till Tuesday next. Defendants were admitted
</p>
<p>to bail in their own recognizances.
</p>
<p>His Lordship, in dismissing the jury, said that it might be satisfactory to them, as
</p>
<p>there was great interest excited in this case, to have his opinion. He could sa}'^ that he
</p>
<p>entirely concurred in the verdict at which they had arrived.
</p>
<p>Tuesdaij, 11 th December 1861.
</p>
<p>Before a Full Court.
</p>
<p>(Their Lordships having taken their seats on the bench shortly after eleven o'clock,
</p>
<p>the nine Bhattias, convicted on Saturday last of conspiracy to obstruct the course of public
</p>
<p>justice, were arraigned. The Court room was early crowded with people of all classes, so
</p>
<p>great was the interest to know the result of this peculiar case.)
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley moved the Court that judgment should be arrested, or that a new trial
</p>
<p>should be had. Addressing himself first to the cause of arrest of judgment he said no
</p>
<p>criminal offence was set forth in any count of the indictment. If set forth at all, it was
</p>
<p>in the first four counts. The charges contained in those several counts were charges which
</p>
<p>were perfectly unknown to the law of England and of India, and in point of fact no legal
</p>
<p>offence was stated : it could not be said that such an offence was ever before stated in any
</p>
<p>indictment in this Court, or in any Court in Great Britain. The indictment was for con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, and in the first four counts several overt acts were set out, and in the description
</p>
<p>of the offence the word used, " intimidated," had no legal signification. The first count,
</p>
<p>after certain introductory remarks, states that " the defendants on the 6th September did
</p>
<p>among themselves conspire to intimidate persons from giving evidence." Then the indictment
</p>
<p>set out six overt acts, one of which was that the defendants would punish all persons who
</p>
<p>should come foward to give evidence ; another, that they called a meeting on the 4th of
</p>
<p>September for conspiring to prevent persons from giving evidence ; another, that they next
</p>
<p>Dalled a meeting on the 5th of September for intimidating persons ; another, that they
</p>
<p>called a meeting on the 6th of September for providing for the expulsion of all persons
</p>
<p>from caste who should appear and give evidence against the Maharaj ; and another overt
</p>
<p>act was, that the defendants compelled all persons to sign a book. It was a count framed
</p>
<p>on some supposed common law offence. In the first four counts the word " intimidate"
</p>
<p>was used. Now, there was no authority for such an indictment. The learned counsel
</p>
<p>referred their Lordships to a case 2 Strange's Reports, p. 904, and others, all of which
</p>
<p>sustained the argument. The learned counsel cited a case decided in the 4th year of the
</p>
<p>reign of George the 2nd, where the indictment was for persuading a witness not to give

</p>
<p>evidence in a case of forgery, and said it was no doubt highly criminal to persuade persons
</p>
<p>from giving evidence where the Queen was prosecuting ; but the case before this Court was
</p>
<p>for intimidation in a ci\il suit, and no case whatever could be found where an indictment
</p>
<p>had been drav,'n under such circumstances. The cases were entirely different ; one was a
</p>
<p>case where the King or Queen was prosecutor, and in the other it was a case of civil
</p>
<p>49
</p>
<p>right. In this case there was no ground of criminal proceeding. Mr. Bayley cited (13
</p>
<p>East) the case of The Khvj vs. Tamer and others ; and The Queen vs. Rowlands and
</p>
<p>others, which was a recent ca;e in the Queen's Bench, in which it was held that the
</p>
<p>defendants conspired unlawfully to intimidate, and the Court held that the indictment was
</p>
<p>bad. The workmen conspired unlawfully to intimidate their master, and that was a more
</p>
<p>active case than the present one. He (.Mr. Bayley) submitted that it lay upon his learned
</p>
<p>friends for the prosecution to show that the indictment would lie. In Kussel on Crime,
</p>
<p>page 557, it is stated in the third paragraph on conspiracy, to be a misdemeanour to per-
</p>
<p>suade a witness not to give evidence, and the note appended to that referred to 2 Strange,
</p>
<p>which he had already cited. The learned gentleman said it was only a case for damages
</p>
<p>on the civil side, and cited Commyn's Pigest Action on the case for conspiracy, A.
</p>
<p>Justice Arnould threw out as a suggestion, that although the conspiracy was to intimidate
</p>
<p>witnesses in a civil suit, and there might be a remedy at the suit, the law as relating to
</p>
<p>conspiracy should be administered equally strong.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley submitted that this Court would be guided by the law as laid down, and
</p>
<p>that it would not now be making a case by its decision. He submitted with due deference
</p>
<p>that were their Lordships to hold the indictment good, they would be making law instead
</p>
<p>of administering the law as it exists, for the only one legal authority referring to anything
</p>
<p>like the present case favoured his (Mr. Ba, ley's) argument. Assuming that the Court was
</p>
<p>against him he submitted that tiie first four counts were incorrect, the words ' intimidate"
</p>
<p>and " prevent" being used in all, and unless those two words described a legal offence, the
</p>
<p>indictment would not lie. Now as to the word " intimidate" two counts in the indictment
</p>
<p>in O'Connell's case were held bad ; Chief Justice Tindal's judgment on that point delivering
</p>
<p>the unanimous judgment of nine English judges was, that the word " intimidate" was not
</p>
<p>a technical word. O'Connell's Case, 11 Ch. Fin. 125. The context in the present indict-
</p>
<p>ment did not state what was an offence against the law.
</p>
<p>Justice Arnould.  " Maliciously to intimidate and prevent" are the words.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley.  Well, that states no offence whatever. If your Lordships declare that
</p>
<p>to be an offence in the statute, you declare that to be law which no judge in England or
</p>
<p>here ever before has declared law. If your Lordships will admit the validity of the
</p>
<p>argument against the indictment, I will move for a new trial on the following grounds.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ans ey said, that up to this moment the parties had not pursued the course they
</p>
<p>ought to have done to move the court for a new trial. In such a Court as ihis, an ad-
</p>
<p>journed Court of Oyer and Terminer and Gaol Delivery, no motion for a new trial could be made,

</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey said that a new trial could only be granted on a certiorari. The case cited by
</p>
<p>his learned friend, Mr. Bayley  The Queen vs. Rowlands  was such a case ; the 11 and
</p>
<p>12 Vict. ch. 78, stated how a question of law might be stated, and the case of The Queen
</p>
<p>vs. Miller, cited, in the last edition of Archibald, illustrated it. Now what he (Mr.
</p>
<p>Anstey) submitted, was this : we are now before the Court of General Sessions of the
</p>
<p>Peace for the Town and Island of Bombay, and not before a Ci'urt of Queen' Bench, and
</p>
<p>therefore this Court could not hear a motion for a new trial. The Chief Justice sat not as
</p>
<p>one of the Court, but as an Assessor or Adviser.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley said that his learned friend's argument did not apply here. If their
</p>
<p>Lordships were to refuse the motion, they would take away from the defendants convicted
</p>
<p>of rnisdemeanour, a right which belonged to them to have a new trial, In. all cases of
</p>
<p>7
</p>
<p>50
</p>
<p>misdemeanour, after conviction the Courts may grant a new trial. And as to the present
</p>
<p>not being a Full Court, he (Mr. Bayley) referred to a case which came on before Justice
</p>
<p>Arnould some months ago, in which he (iMr, Bayley) appeared for the prosecution, and in
</p>
<p>that case his Lordship, the Chief Justice, gave judgment, and the prisoner was now
</p>
<p>suffering the imprisonment.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice Sausse said he generally expressed his opinion. He was sitting as an
</p>
<p>Assessor merely, and where he coincided with Justice Arnould, it did not much matter who
</p>
<p>expressed the opinion of the Court.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley.  This is really a branch of the Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>Justice Arnould thought the difficulty seemed to rest in this way, the means of get-
</p>
<p>ting the case from the Court of Sessions to the Court of Queen's Bench in order for the
</p>
<p>motion for a new trial. The only consequence of deciding in favour of Mr. Anstey's
</p>
<p>argument would be that the Court would suspend the Court of Sessions, and would constitute
</p>
<p>a Court of Queen's Bench for the time being for the purpose of the motion.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley called for their Lordships to adjourn the Court of Sessions, and to proclaim
</p>
<p>the sitting of the Supreme Court through the Court crier.
</p>
<p>Justice Arnould said supposing the Court to be sitting as a Full Court of Queen's
</p>
<p>Bench, could it at this time take notice of the motion for a new trial without a certiorari ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley argued that the difficulty lay in the variety of jurisdictions pertaining to
</p>
<p>this Court. By the charter the Supreme Court held Criminal Sessions, but it was still the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court. The very indictment before them was held in the Supreme Court of
</p>
<p>Judicature at Bombay. But if the objection taken by the learned counsel on behalf of
</p>
<p>the prosecution be allowed, it might have the effect of depriving the defendants of that
</p>
<p>right which unquestionably they have to a new trial. This case was not a case in an
</p>
<p>inferior Court, but in a branch of the Supreme Court. AVould a certiorari have the
</p>
<p>effect of bringing into Court that which was already in the Supreme Court ?
</p>
<p>Justice Arnould referred to the constitution of the Supreme Court. There was no
</p>
<p>special commission given the Judges for the Court of Oyer and Terminer.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley thanked his Lordship. He was aware that the constitution of the
</p>
<p>Courts here was different from those in England. In England there were five special
</p>
<p>commissions for the Circuit Courts. Mr. Bayley referred to K. vs. Gompertz, vol. 9
</p>
<p>Queen's Bench Reports, p. 824, where in a trial for conspiracy before Lord Denman
</p>
<p>a rule was made absolute for a new trial ; and to K. vs. Whitehouse 1 Dean C. C.
</p>
<p>1 wliere a new trial in a case of conspiracy was granted on the ground of surprise,

</p>
<p>and the Court would see that none of these motions for a new trial were made before
</p>
<p>the judge who tried the case.
</p>
<p>Justice Arnould  In the case of King vs. Mawhey the question of new trials was
</p>
<p>very fully argued.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley  Yes, and sustains my argument that every man convicted of misde-
</p>
<p>meanour is entitled to a new trial.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice Sausse  You lay it down as an abstract proposition that every mis-
</p>
<p>demeanant is entitled to move for a new trial.
</p>
<p>51
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley laid It down as a general rule, when the case was either originally
</p>
<p>in the Court of Queen's Bench, or removed there by writ of certiorari.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice Sausse said he only sat here at present as an Assessor. He knew
</p>
<p>nothing of the case except as he heard it from counsel. The matter must be brought
</p>
<p>before the Court in some way if the Judges sat as a Court of Queen's Bench.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley thought it neeil not be by a writ of errtiorari. In England the
</p>
<p>proceedings could only be brought to the superior from the inferior Court by a writ
</p>
<p>of certiorari.
</p>
<p>Justice Arnould said the question was, is the Court sitting as a Court of Oyer
</p>
<p>and Terminer an inferior Court ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley  Certainly not. There was no more difference between this Court and
</p>
<p>the Supreme Court, than there w^as between the Supreme Court on the plea side and
</p>
<p>equity side. This Court was a Supreme Court on the criminal side, and is expressly
</p>
<p>so stated in the charter," and their Lordships had the full power which the Court of
</p>
<p>Queen's Bench in England had.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey, with regard to the remarks of the learned counsel moving for a new
</p>
<p>trial said, that their Lordships' attention had been directed solely to the charter. Now
</p>
<p>the charter had nothing to do with it. Their Lordships had five special jurisdictions, and
</p>
<p>when they were exercising the jurisdiction of the Court of Oyer and Terminer they
</p>
<p>were not exercising the jurisdiction of a Court of Queen's Bench. The motion for a
</p>
<p>certiorari ought to have been made before, and as it was not made, and as it was
</p>
<p>now too late for a writ to issue, motion for a new trial could not be made. If
</p>
<p>the trial had taken place before their Lordships sitting as a Court of Queen's Bench,
</p>
<p>then motion for a new trial might have been made in Queen's Bench. His learned
</p>
<p>friend (Mr. Bayley) had moved the Court in arrest of judgment, as he had a perfect
</p>
<p>right to do, but he was not competent to go beyond that. In the case of The King
</p>
<p>vs. Maicbey in vol. 6, Law Reports, it will be seen there must have been a writ of
</p>
<p>certiorari. The case of The King vs. Oxford was similar. If the writ were now granted
</p>
<p>in this case, he (Mr. Anstey) could foretell no end of litigation at future criminal
</p>
<p>sessions when every prisoner, either personally or through counsel would apply for
</p>
<p>a new trial.
</p>
<p>Justice Arnould.  A certiorari was issued according to practice only the other day
</p>
<p>by a single judge sitting as a Pull Court. It was simply a writ from a superior to
</p>
<p>an inferior Court.

</p>
<p>Chief Justice Sausse was of opinion that every person who was convicted of
</p>
<p>misdemeanour at the Assizes at home, here at Oyer and Terminer, was entitled to a
</p>
<p>new trial on good grounds.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley had stated several grounds. He had been told that a certiorari was
</p>
<p>never applied for here.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice Sausse.  The other day a writ was applied for in case of a corporation.
</p>
<p>The law compels defendants to appear in person, and as a corporation cannot be personally
</p>
<p>present, it was therefore thought necessary to bring the case where the defendant might
</p>
<p>appear by attorney or counsel.
</p>
<p>52
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley said there was a clause in the cliarter which gave the defendants the
</p>
<p>privilege of appealing to the Privy Council ; and certan objections taken by him had
</p>
<p>not been decided by the Judge, and had not been argued so fully as they would have
</p>
<p>been if the points had not been reserved by the learned Judge for further consideration 
</p>
<p>in case of a conviction, The defendants were greatly prejudiced, and it was little else
</p>
<p>than a fraud upon them to reserve certain points of law and afteawards refuse to have
</p>
<p>them argued ; and he and his learned friends were convinced that evidence had been
</p>
<p>most improperly received at the trial and that the conviction could not be sustained.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice Sausse.  The Judge who hears the trial has the right of ruling
</p>
<p>different parts of evidence as it appears before him.
</p>
<p>Justice Arnould said he took a note of the objection, and at the end of the Court
</p>
<p>gave leave to counsel to apply for a new trial in general terms. There was a
</p>
<p>concession given which ought not to have been given  that was all. The motion for ft
</p>
<p>new trial must be disallowed.
</p>
<p>Motion in arrest of judgmeyit resumed.
</p>
<p>Mr. Green, who appeared with Mr. Bayley, offered a few arguments in addition.
</p>
<p>The only case of obstruction of justice was such that from the nature of the case
</p>
<p>justice might be obstructed by the conspiracy. The learned gentleman s -id that the
</p>
<p>conspiracy to prevent, if sound at all, ought to be to prevent persons from giving evidence
</p>
<p>who had been lawfully summoned to appear and give evidence ; he cited Queen vs.
</p>
<p>Turner, 13 East ; Queen vs. Epworth, and other cases. !Now in this case there was
</p>
<p>no lawful summons  only a personal request to persons to appear and give evidence. It was not
</p>
<p>stated that those persons were liable to appear and give evidence in this Court ; and
</p>
<p>it must be made to appear that such was ihe case. There was high authority in
</p>
<p>support of this point. (The learned gentleman cited King vs. Pywell, Kivg vs. Bellinger,
</p>
<p>and other cases.) Keally there was no case parallel to the present to be found in
</p>
<p>the law regarding persons conspiring to prevent a person from giving evidence. There
</p>
<p>might be an action as every one Knows against the witness himself for damages, should
</p>
<p>he refuse to appear and give evidence. In vol. 7, Law Journal, New series, p. 1028,
</p>
<p>there was a case of conspiracy to abuse a process of the Court by putting it in
</p>
<p>motion ; and in that case there was no summons, and therefore no damages. On those
</p>
<p>two points the use of the word " unlawful," and the second, the absence of a summons,
</p>
<p>the learned gentleman left the case to their Lordships' consideration.
</p>
<p>Mr. Connon followed and said that he had a substantial ground for moving for

</p>
<p>an arrest of judgment. He was of opinion that the evidence did not disclose a criminal
</p>
<p>offence ; he cited the case of O'Connel, when judgment was arrested, and he gathered
</p>
<p>from what Lord Campbell said on the occassion, that when the parties indicted had done
</p>
<p>what they had been conspiring to do, they could be charged with obstructing the course
</p>
<p>of public justice. It was the first time in his Hfe, continued Mr. Connon, that the
</p>
<p>editor of a native paper sought to be dignified by the publication of a libel, a suit for
</p>
<p>which is pending on the plea side of this Court. These parties, the present defendants,
</p>
<p>could have no direct interest in the settlement of a dispute between those two individuals.
</p>
<p>53
</p>
<p>The only case which he remembered and which he thought bore a somewhat resem-
</p>
<p>blance to this, was a conspiracy to hiss in a public assembly : but as that partook of
</p>
<p>a civil character it was only a civil injury. It had also bt-en suggested, observed Mr.
</p>
<p>Connon, that if the parties subpoenaed to attend did not attend, then there would be an
</p>
<p>injury, and an action may be maintained. He submitted to their Lordships that it
</p>
<p>did not appear by the indictment that the parties charged, were within the jurisdiction
</p>
<p>of this Court, and he hoped that the Court would take judicial notice of this obiection.
</p>
<p>The Bhattias were a class of people numbering large, and the Court could only have
</p>
<p>jurisdiction over such of them as were within the town and island of Bombay, and
</p>
<p>therefore the indictment was faulty in this respect. He submitted that the Maharaj,
</p>
<p>the prosecutor in the plea suit, had just as much a chance in being bribed as any
</p>
<p>witness, and concluded his remarks by stating, that the evidence adduced for the
</p>
<p>prosecution did not bring home to the defendants a criminal offence.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice Sausse.  The present is a motion to arrest judgment, and you cannot
</p>
<p>travel out of it. You are treating with the evidence brought before the Court at the
</p>
<p>trial, but which is not before the Court now.
</p>
<p>Mr. Connon.  I may ask your Lordships, what would be the consequence of finding
</p>
<p>these men guilty ? It would only tolerate abundant prosecutions of this character, arising
</p>
<p>out of civil suits. There is not a case pending in this or any Court in which parties
</p>
<p>are not asked to give evidence one side or the other. It were better if each washed
</p>
<p>his dirty linen at home than come here to do so.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anst(y.  I shall confine myself, my Lord, to the motion for arrest of judg-
</p>
<p>ment. Before I enter upon it, I must ask your Lordship's leave to point out the
</p>
<p>fallacy of Mr. Bayley's and the other learned gentlemen's arguments. The indictment
</p>
<p>would have been perfectly good had it omitted the overt acts altogether. It was only
</p>
<p>out of grace and favour that I did not press them to be made out stronger. The
</p>
<p>cases of Queen vs. Brown and others, and Queen vs. Sap'eton and others, reported in
</p>
<p>6 Weekly Reporter 1861, are in point. The Court on the occasion makes remark,
</p>
<p>that although it is not necessary to mention overt acts in the indictment, it may,
</p>
<p>however, be done. The defendants are not charged with tampering with witnesses in
</p>
<p>giving evidence, but they are charged with intimidating witnesses to give evidence. Away
</p>
<p>goes the objection just raised upon this subject. An offence to obstruct justice is not
</p>
<p>an offence in law ! a witness cannot be a witness unless he is subpoenaed ! he cannot
</p>
<p>volunteer to be a witness ! why cannot the witness be voluntary ? why is not the

</p>
<p>prosecutor prohibited in giving his evidence ? I'he absence of a subpoena cannot affect
</p>
<p>the quality of the crime charged ! My Lord, I think I have said sufficient against
</p>
<p>this frivolous objection. I now proceed to the other objection  a specious one. I find
</p>
<p>in that book, that conspiracy is a harmless word, but may be taken by the commentary
</p>
<p>in an ill sense. Objection has been taken by Mr. Bayley to the word " intimidate"
</p>
<p>in the indictment. What are words ? They specify the meaning  they specily the
</p>
<p>purport, and they specify what is laid down. The introduction of the word " intimidate"
</p>
<p>does not affect the meaning of the word " prevent." (Here Mr. Anstey read the
</p>
<p>indictment.) The defendants attempted by certain overt acts mentioned in the indictment,
</p>
<p>to punish those members of their caste by excommunication on their giving evidence in
</p>
<p>the plea action. Your Lordship is bound to take judicial notice of this fact. Now
</p>
<p>comes an answer to another objection which is entirely frivolous. It is not for conspiring
</p>
<p>54
</p>
<p>amongst themselves, but for deterring others from giving evidence, especially of persons
</p>
<p>who are invited to give evidence. They are threatened with expulsion from the caste,
</p>
<p>also with the loss of certain privileges. The indictment says, " then and there witnesses."
</p>
<p>Another count of the indictment says, that the parties were to be prevented from giving
</p>
<p>evidence by a caste meeting. The overt act was, they did call a caste meeting, and
</p>
<p>the next overt act was, that at the meeting they proposed to take measures to expel
</p>
<p>from the caste any person who should give evidence on behalf of Karsandass Mooljee,
</p>
<p>the defendant in the libel action. The next overt act was, that they induced divers
</p>
<p>Hindu persons to sign a certain book by which they bound themselves to suffer ex-
</p>
<p>communication in the event of their giving evidence against the Maharaj. This is a
</p>
<p>motion for arrest of judgment which cannot be entertained by the Court. As the verdict
</p>
<p>was a general one, and which I must ask your Lordships to infer from the very fact
</p>
<p>that the jury appeared satisfied on their returning their verdict. Strange's Hindu Law
</p>
<p>states the consequences of excommunication, and which is very severe ; they are not
</p>
<p>only expelled from their caste, but they are prohibited from contracting the marriage
</p>
<p>of their sons and daughters. In the case of O'Connel the charge of conspiracy was to
</p>
<p>alter the law by intimidation and physical force : in this case the law was different and
</p>
<p>the charge was framed upon it. Now look at the word " prevent" ; it has been
</p>
<p>used by pleaders since the earliest time The objection that applies to intimidate, does
</p>
<p>not apply to prevent. Intimidate, it is argued, has no content, the counts all say
</p>
<p>" prevent from giving evidence." (Here Mr. Anstey read from the 2nd vol. of Russel
</p>
<p>on Crime and cited a case.) Where a person is charged with conspiring to prevent
</p>
<p>a tailor by indirect means from carrying on his trade, the presiding Judge held
</p>
<p>that the indictment was good.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice Sausse.  I do not think, Mr. Anstey, that it was suggested that the
</p>
<p>word " prevent" in the 5th indictment was not good.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey here read the 5th indictment and said.  Every overt act charged m
</p>
<p>the indictment was proved in the evidence at the time of trial ; the jury found guilty
</p>
<p>on the word " prevent." There is no ground for criticism in the way the jury found
</p>
<p>the verdict, or in the way the Clerk of the Crown framed the indictment. We are
</p>
<p>not living in an age when a trifling error of law can destroy an indictment. Assuming
</p>
<p>all, however, to be true, there is no defence whatever to the four corners of the in-
</p>
<p>dictment. (The Judges were consulting and Mr. Anstey stopped his address.)
</p>
<p>Justice Arnould.  I was drawing his Lordship's attention to Lord Campbell's Act

</p>
<p>which empowers the Judge to couple hard labour with the sentence if convicted of preventing,
</p>
<p>perverting and defeating the ends of justice.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey.  Open conspiracy ' by means of force and threats of a barbarous, aye,
</p>
<p>and uncultivated race are crimes of an uncivilized epoch. In former days the star
</p>
<p>chamber was resorted to to effect intimidation of witnesses, but in the present day, a
</p>
<p>constable is sufficient to put to flight a number of intimidators. Since the star chamber
</p>
<p>has been done away with, we have had charges of perjury, subornation of perjury. In
</p>
<p>the present case we have had, as your Lordships know, rich men as the defendants :
</p>
<p>the prosecution has been costly to the prosecutor and laborious to ourselves, and it will
</p>
<p>be dangerous to Government to let such go unpunished. In the case of King vs. Mawbey
</p>
<p>there was no distinction of a penal character, and it was the only way in which the
</p>
<p>55
</p>
<p>jury understood it ;" the case was a trial for a conspiracy to obtain a false certificate.
</p>
<p>In the case of King vs. Mawhey these parties did conspire together to obtain a false
</p>
<p>certificate : the second count was with intent to deceive the Court by producing a false
</p>
<p>certificate, and the third count was somewhat similar. Lord Kennyon says that the
</p>
<p>offence may be an indictable one [Mr. Anstey referred to the following
</p>
<p>cases,' Queen vs. Roebuck, Qveen vs Roberts, p. 129, Queen vs. Eagkion, p. 80, and
</p>
<p>others] ......
</p>
<p>Assuming that a man can commit a fraud which could be tried only on the civil side, still there
</p>
<p>are cases (the present is one) which are indictable and punishable. Defamation, libel, conspi-
</p>
<p>racy may be made the subject of an action at law, and they may consistently be put on the
</p>
<p>criminal side of the law. What do we know but that the prosecutor is gaining by this act of the
</p>
<p>conspirators ? In a criminal action, the injury done is done to the Queen. She has no right
</p>
<p>of action in a case of tort. 1 page of the state trial. In the case of Haines it was contended
</p>
<p>that a defaulter to the Queen could be actionable at criminal law, but of a private person or
</p>
<p>company he cannot be Assuming the indictment to be true, there has been an
</p>
<p>attempt to impoverish him  an attempt to dissuade others from giving evidence, and an
</p>
<p>attempt to get witnesses to swear to what is false. The very case cited by my learned
</p>
<p>friend in Strange's Hindu law is against him absence of all precedent
</p>
<p>in dealing with men at the bar ; prisoners are called upon to answer.
</p>
<p>Mr. Dunbar  My argument is in reference to the argument of Mr. Bayley. In
</p>
<p>O'Connel's case the jury tound a verdict upon some of the counts, and as it was a
</p>
<p>special verdict a new trial was allowed ; but in this case the verdict was general, and
</p>
<p>therefore no new trial can be had.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley then replied and said, there was no authority to support these various
</p>
<p>counts. The counts in the indictment in O'Connel's case all relied on the same matter :
</p>
<p>the same words were used in all by means of " intimidation" ; and all were upheld
</p>
<p>by the judges, though they found fault with the jury. (The learned gentleman cited
</p>
<p>cases). The Court's attention had been called to the word " intimidate" and " conspire."
</p>
<p>Now the word " intimidate" only meant an improper action. The word " conspire"
</p>
<p>no doubt meant an illegal action. The nine judges were unanimously of opinion that
</p>
<p>there was no techincally bad meaning to the word " intimidate." ]Mr. Anstey had
</p>
<p>said that the purport of the word was the essence of the word. That was mere
</p>
<p>quibbling. The opinion of the judges was that " intimidation" was not an illegal word.
</p>
<p>Justice Arnould.  The defendants are here charged with intimidating by means

</p>
<p>which are set out following ; there is a great difference.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley said one count in the present indictment was a conspiracy to intimidate
</p>
<p>the whole world  to prevent all members of the Bhattia cast from giving evidence ;
</p>
<p>it was too general. The indictment did not even state that these persons were in
</p>
<p>existence  no averment of that : it says, " certain" persons. Now it assumes that
</p>
<p>there are " certain" persons. The arguments taken by his learned friend, Mr. Green,
</p>
<p>were good, and had not been answered. These persons had not been summoned : then
</p>
<p>the indictment did not state that those witnesses were alive or were within the jurisdiction
</p>
<p>of the Court, or were willing to come forward and give evidence. The indictment
</p>
<p>raised up a certain class of people as existing in order to charge them with being
</p>
<p>intimidated by the defendants. Now the persons may be at Poona or in England,
</p>
<p>56
</p>
<p>There was no averment that any other supposed witnesses were within the jurisdiction,
</p>
<p>or that they were summoned or able to attend, and it was consistent with the averments
</p>
<p>thait not a single witness could or ought to attend. He cited K. vs. Stevenson, 2
</p>
<p>Hast. 362, where the witness intimidated had been duly summoned according to law.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice Sausse.  The conspiracy, as the counts allege, occurred within the
</p>
<p>jurisdiction ; and it don't matter where the persons are.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley said it did with his argument. Supposing there were 10,000 people
</p>
<p>in Cutch, and there was merely a meeting in Bombay to try to persuade those people
</p>
<p>from coming here, surely the calling of that meeting would not be an illegal act. The
</p>
<p>count did not state that that evidence was material. And there had not been a single
</p>
<p>text-book or decision shewn to make the act an illegal act. Then much had been
</p>
<p>said of the word " prevent," which he (Mr. Bayley) contended in some cases meant
</p>
<p>" assist !" We have a collect, said Mr. Bayley, beginning with " Prevent us, Lord"
</p>
<p>&c. &c., which plainly had this meaning, and surely those good men who composed it
</p>
<p>had as good a knowledge of English as we ourselves have.
</p>
<p>Justice Arnould  Do you mean to say that " intimidate" and prevent" in that
</p>
<p>collocation the word" prevent" means assist ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley did not argue that. He thought some other word ought to have
</p>
<p>been used. The word had not that comprehertsive meaning that " murder," and such
</p>
<p>other words, had. As " conspiracy," as his learned friend had said always had a bad
</p>
<p>meaning. Now, in this charge, there were four words used  combine, conspire, confe-
</p>
<p>derate, and agree together, that the case should not, if possible, slip through. Now
</p>
<p>the indictment should have gone on and stated the overt acts and damages done. For
</p>
<p>argument, he would assume that an action in the nature of a conspiracy would lie if
</p>
<p>damages had accrued : it followed that a person would have a remedy for years before
</p>
<p>the time when he might have a right of action, which right of action might be
</p>
<p>successfully defended. It is perfectly consistent to say that no injury has been done
</p>
<p>to the prosecutor, public justice, or any thing else. It was not shown that what the
</p>
<p>defendants did in any degree affected the case, or that a single witness had been
</p>
<p>intimidated. No harm had been done  it was an abstract proposition laid in the
</p>
<p>indictment, and not supported by any authority. There was a verdict, and their
</p>
<p>Lordships could not alter that verdict. He thought judgment had not been received here.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice Sausse said he understood the present motion was in arrest of
</p>
<p>judgment.

</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley said the verdict was general, and therefore the Court could not alter
</p>
<p>the finding. The jury had been discharged without being asked on which count they
</p>
<p>convicted. Judgment was bad, and should be arrested.
</p>
<p>Justice Arnould said the Court did not consider that sufficient grounds had been
</p>
<p>shown for an arrest of judgment. After enumerating the counts, and the overt acts
</p>
<p>which were to carry them out, the learned judge said this appeared to him to be an
</p>
<p>offence at common law. There was an action brought before Her Majesty's Supreme
</p>
<p>Court for redress of a wrong, it was necessary that the Court should proceed in a certain
</p>
<p>way, among other things have the evidence of witnesses, to do justice ; and any
</p>
<p>attempt to change that course was an attempt to prevent that Court from doing what it
</p>
<p>57
</p>
<p>was appointed to do, justice. ICow an action was brought hy the Afaharaj for the rei^ress of
</p>
<p>what he felt a wrong, and then intimidation is offered to those witnesses by his devotees to
</p>
<p>prevent them from appearing in Court and giving evidfnce. Kow, it would be a very great
</p>
<p>injustice, to hold that a m n who has to defend himself against a serious charge in the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court has not the right to defend himself. It clearly did not make any difference
</p>
<p>wt ether the defendants carried out their filnn or not. or whether the present prosecutor
</p>
<p>had a remedy at civil law. 'I'he parties suffering had a right to call upon the aggressors
</p>
<p>to account for their misconduct. With regard to the mere technical oljectioiis which
</p>
<p>had been taken, the learned judge said there was nothing in them. The whole gist
</p>
<p>of the case was in the word ' combination.' In a case cited it was not clearly shown
</p>
<p>what the meaning of the word was, but the case here was totally different  it was to
</p>
<p>intimidate and prevent by means which were set out, so that there was no possibility
</p>
<p>of vagueness. It also appeared to the learned judge that it did not matter though
</p>
<p>the witnesses were not summoned. The essence was the combination for a common
</p>
<p>object. The quality, kind, and nature of the offence was the same, though the degree
</p>
<p>might be mitigated. 'I he verdict was general. In his Lordship's opinion each count
</p>
<p>was good. Judgment had not yet been entered up.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey asked that judgment might be entered up on each count,
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley requested as a matter of right a new trial for the six defendants
</p>
<p>whom he represented, and he also moved on the ground that the points had been
</p>
<p>expressly reserved for argument by Justice Arnould.
</p>
<p>Justice Arnould said that question had been decided.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley asked the Court merely as a matter of form preliminary to further
</p>
<p>proceedings. He had understood that the question of a new trial was not fully decided,
</p>
<p>Mr, Anstey pleaded for judgment on the defendants,
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley said he wished to call a few witnesses as to character.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey took some objection, when
</p>
<p>Justice Arnould asked if he (Mr, Anstey) had not asked for mercy for the
</p>
<p>defendants on Saturday when they were convicted ?
</p>
<p>Mr, Anstey said he !iad, and although he would not retract, yet the prosecutor
</p>
<p>and all concerned in the prosecution had received nothing but sneers from the defendants
</p>
<p>in consequence of the appeal.
</p>
<p>Messrs. J. Cassels, M, II. Seott, T. F. Gray, J. Bevis, K, Hannay, merchants
</p>
<p>of high standing, were called on behalf of the defendants. Most of them spoke to an

<p>acquaintance with the defendants for terms of ten, fifteen or twenty years, and to the
</p>
<p>high character they bore in the mercantile community.
</p>
<p>W. Crawford, Esq. Senior Magistrate of Police, was also called, and said that ho
</p>
<p>had known Hagoo Shamje<j he believed for twenty-two years. Defendant was one of
</p>
<p>the mildest mannered men, and one of the gentlest men, he ever dealt with.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley made a few remarks in mitigation of punishment, on the position of
</p>
<p>the defttudants, the novelty of Uie offence, the absence of any proofs that the defvudaati
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>58
</p>
<p>most of whom only spoke their native tongue, knew they were doing wrong ; and with
</p>
<p>all deference submitted that a very light sentence would meet the ends of justice.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey said that after this he would retract every word he had said on Saturday
</p>
<p>in favor of the prisoners (Sensation and strong expressions of dissatisfaction.)
</p>
<p>Justice Arnould in sentenciny the prisoners, said : Gentlemen of very high
</p>
<p>respectability in this community have just been heard to give you a high character,
</p>
<p>and of the perfect truth of their evidence I have no manner of doubt. From the
</p>
<p>beginning to the end of this trial there has been no imputation upon your character
</p>
<p>as peaceably disposed and orderly persons. The charge against you is this : that a
</p>
<p>person whom you hold in the highest regard has brought an action in this Court for
</p>
<p>damages on account of the publication of an article charging him with adultery and
</p>
<p>other immoral practices. The editor of that journal, when the action was brought
</p>
<p>against him, as one of Her Majesty's subjects, he had a clear right to do, put on the
</p>
<p>records of this Court a plea to defend himself at this trial. I have no doubt but that
</p>
<p>you have been put up to do what you did do, by Paroo (das) who was managing
</p>
<p>this case. That plea has been represented as an attack  it is not an attack, but a
</p>
<p>defence, as you were perfectly well aware of. And you, being men of respectability
</p>
<p>as you are, could not have been so perfectly ignorant as not to know that bribing a
</p>
<p>witness was an offence ; it was then endeavoured to prevent truth and justice from
</p>
<p>being done by another course. But although in Courts the allegation of belief cannot
</p>
<p>exclude or mitigate punishment, I am not going to exclude human nature in the
</p>
<p>sentence I shall now pass upon you. In passing sentence I have two extremes to
</p>
<p>guard against : on the one had I am not going to pass a sentence which will seem
</p>
<p>vindictive, while on the other hand I must avoid the appearance of overlooking the
</p>
<p>facts as it would seem to exclude the whole truth of the prosecution. It is fitting that
</p>
<p>you should know the law of England on this offence as applicable here, and I will
</p>
<p>read it by way of a warning against any future crime. (His Lordship read from Lord
</p>
<p>Campbell's Act, the law empowering judges to couple hard labor with imprisonment for
</p>
<p>the whole term of sentence). That is the law. I don't intend on this occasion to
</p>
<p>avail myself of the power given. The sentence of the Court upon the two leading
</p>
<p>men, you Goculdass Lilladhur, and you Lukmidass Damjee, is, that each pay a fine
</p>
<p>of Ks. 1000 ; and the seven other defendants each a fine of Rs. 500. [The fines
</p>
<p>were immediately paid and the defendants left the Court with their friends.]

<p>defendants.
</p>
<p>First Day, Saturday, 2Dth January 1862.
</p>
<p>Mr. Scoble opened the case by reading a portion of the pleas.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley  " In this case I have the honor to appear with my learned friend
</p>
<p>Mr. Scoble to ask your Lordships for damages for a most wanton and unprovoked
</p>
<p>libel published on the 21st October 18G0 in a native Guzerathi newspaper, the Satya
</p>
<p>Prakash. The plaintiff, your Lordships will see from the plaint, bears a high character
</p>
<p>amongst a certain class of people, and as the case presents some circumstances of a
</p>
<p>peculiar character, and as this is the first time that any one of the Maharajs have
</p>
<p>sought redress in a court of justice, the plaintiff is subject to all advantages and dis-
</p>
<p>advantages attendant upon it : also amongst others of being examined and cross-examined
</p>
<p>on the part of the defendants. I^ow your Lordships will see that a person situated "
</p>
<p>as he is, respected and revered among numerous followers in Bombay and other places,
</p>
<p>it* becomes a matter of importance that the practice set forth in the pleas should be
</p>
<p>proved. He, of course, would have abstained from bringing such an action, so confident
</p>
<p>is he of the falsity of the allegations that he is disposed to risk every thing, but it
</p>
<p>is important for him to vindicate his character. Your Lordships will see that he could
</p>
<p>not well remain  silent. The case before the Court on the part of the plaintiff is a
</p>
<p>simple one ; but before I proceed to the question of libel I may inform your Lordships
</p>
<p>that the plaintiff is a person of thirty-four or tliirty-five years of age, and that he
</p>
<p>resides for the most part in Suiat, occasionally coming to Bombay. Though not
</p>
<p>educated in the European sense of the term, he is conversant with several native
</p>
<p>languages ; he has always taken an interest in the cause of native female education,
</p>
<p>which alone gives him respect and honor in this country, and speaks volumes in his
</p>
<p>favor. He seeks redress through a proper channel, to which he is justly entitled.
</p>
<p>With these few introductory remarks, let me call your Lordships' attention to the libel
</p>
<p>itself. I shall not at first enter at all into the rebutting proof of the evidence which

<p>may be brought forward, the burden will lie upon the defendants, as they are going,
</p>
<p>I believe, to justify the libel. It is unnecessary to trouble your Lordships with the
</p>
<p>case, as one of your Lordships is already cognisant of the particular facts and circum-
</p>
<p>stances in the demurrer case. The authorized translations shewn in the plaint itself is
</p>
<p>in these terms : 
</p>
<p>60
</p>
<p>[Mr Bayley here read before the Court the alleged libel.]
</p>
<p> Now your Lordships will see that tlie article divides itself into tvro parts. The
</p>
<p>first part is to a certain extent liistorical ; in the fecond, the writer singles out the
</p>
<p>plaintiff, and in conpiiny with other .Maharajs charfr.'s them with the most filthy and
</p>
<p>obscene conduct ; now that that is a libel, I apprehend your Lordships will liave no
</p>
<p>doubt. I will read AlJisoo. o>f Wrongs, p. 578, 579, fro n the chapter on libel and
</p>
<p>slander. It is there shewn that every publication making a person's society shunned
</p>
<p>and avoided is a libel. To pul)lish and say a man has insulted two females and
</p>
<p>thereby to make his society shunned, is a libel. Tho=!e cases cited by me are merely
</p>
<p>foot-notes, to show what constit tes libel in the opinion of learned judges in England.
</p>
<p>The defendants have filed justification. I atn prepared with a certificate to prove that
</p>
<p>Karsandas, one of the defendants, is the publisher of the libel. Hearing his admission
</p>
<p>in a recent case that he was the publisher, and the other defendant the printer, I
</p>
<p>need not put myself to the trouble of proving the printer and publisher.
</p>
<p>" The sixth plea is as to so much of the alleged libel. I think a special traverse
</p>
<p>as to its being properly translated will have no effect, as I am of opinion that it is
</p>
<p>correctly translated by Mr. Hyim, the official translator. The seventh plea goes into
</p>
<p>minute circumstances, and details a horrible character of the plaintiff. 1'hat disposes of
</p>
<p>all the other pleas. I submit that unless my learned friend is [prepared with substan-
</p>
<p>tive justification, this is clearly a case for damug<'S. 'J he burden of [^roving every
</p>
<p>substantive jtlea of the allegations rests with iny learned friends on behalf of the
</p>
<p>defendants. 'J'he plaintiff is not actuated by any viridictive feelings ; he dues not require
</p>
<p>substantial damages ; nominal damages and an apology would satisfy liim, and save
</p>
<p>trouble to the Court, and much annoyance to the feelin;;s by the recital if horrible
</p>
<p>details. If the defendants do not choose to retract, I am prefiared to prove my client's
</p>
<p>case, and to rebut at the proper time the allegations set up for the defence. I will
</p>
<p>ask my learned friend if he admits the publication and printing of the libel, and also
</p>
<p>that the publisher and printer are the defendants."
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey.  " I admit all No doubt there was a publication. I deny all
</p>
<p>inuendoes ; I deny that it is a libel, and assert that it is a privileged, justifiable
</p>
<p>communication."

</p>

</p>
<p>according to the best of my ability.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " T see the equivalent of a passage bracketted
</p>
<p>in the original ' Mahanijs acting up to the commentary desist from the defilement of
</p>
<p>the wives and d iight rs of your devotees, &c.' (Witness was examined as to the
</p>
<p>graramalind construction of the above piss;ige in t!ie vorua-ular language.) The word
</p>
<p>Maharaj is used in the voiaiive case. The " Brig Bhasha" language is not court

<p>is not a spoken language now. but a written one.
</p>
<p>Re-examined by Mr. Scoble.  " The article which I have translated is in the
</p>
<p>Gujarathi language, and not in the Brig Bhasha language.
</p>
<p>To the Court  " The character of the Brig Bhasha is somewhat similar to the Sanscrit.
</p>
<p>To Mr Scoble.  " The original seat of the Brig Bhaslia language is round A<Tra
</p>
<p>in the North -West. In the native newspapers punctuation is  ot carefully marked.
</p>
<p>Looking at tlie passage translated in the sixth plea, I think it forms two sentences ;

<p>and I hold that view notwithstanding the omission of the f II -stop."
</p>
<p>(2.) Gopallilas Mahadevsclasn, examined by Mr. Bayley.  I am the head of the
</p>
<p>Mahajun or Banian caste of all denominations. They are numerous in Bombay. Ma-
</p>
<p>hajuns are Banians assembled in a meeting. It is necessary to obtain my permission
</p>
<p>to hold meetings of the caste. I know the plaintiff Judoonath Brizruttoiijee Maharaj,
</p>
<p>who is about 40 or 42 years of age. lie occasionally resides in Bombay at intervals
</p>
<p>of 10 or 20 years. He is a resident of Surat. The Banians and Bhattias consider
</p>
<p>the Maharaj in very good liglit, and respect him. ^Mr. Anstey objected to the last
</p>
<p>statement of the witness, and read the S55;h Section of Taylor on Evidence to show
</p>
<p>that the plaintiff cannot give evidence of good character or conduct unless the contrary
</p>
<p>has been offered or alleged against him. Tbe learned counsel alluded to some cases in
</p>
<p>point, and remarked they were not to be got over by any explanation of his learned
</p>
<p>friend. Mr. Bayley said the question was not as to character. He would call atten-
</p>
<p>tion to the 4th plea, which stated " the plaintiff is not a high priest of high Caste"
</p>
<p>Ac. Sir Joseph Arnold.  Taylor has laid down the rule in reference to aggravation of
</p>
<p>damages. I understood the question in a spiritual light. I thought there was a mis-
</p>
<p>und rstanding on the part of the witness, aud that's the reason I asked him if he
</p>
<p>spoke of Maharajs in general. Mr. Anstey.  I have no objection as to his posit on
</p>
<p>among the Maharajs. I object to his personal character being referred to.) 'J'he plain-
</p>
<p>tiff is a Mahtraj : he is our gooroo or S[>iritual guide, who worships our iijols and
</p>
<p>performs divine service. The .Maharaj is a Brahmin, and is above the ordinary run
</p>
<p>of Brahmins. Some Brahuiins who receive a particular religious character from him
</p>
<p>regard him as a gooroo. The Bhattias are worshipiiers of the Maharaj The Bhattia
</p>

</p>
<p>gooroos. A gooroo performs divine service and worshijis the images. The .Maharaj miaht

</p>
<p>the year. The Brahmins read the Purans and other religious books to the people.
</p>
<p>The Mahrajs occasionally read the Purans, but are generally engaged in worshipping the
</p>
<p>images. The Maharajs have temples in Bombay : there are sometimes two, sometimes
</p>
<p>five, and some times ten, and perhaps more Maharajs in B nibay. Some permanently
</p>
<p>reside here, as, for instance. Jeevunjee Maharaj. In India, I believe, there are now
</p>
<p>about 60 or 70 Maharajs. The Maharaj at Sreejee is considered the chief ; he has
</p>
<p>a temple at >'athdoovvar, near Oodeypore, in Northern India. 'J'he Maharajs are spread
</p>
<p>over the cities of Ilindoostan. The rajahs and native princes respect the .Maharajs in
</p>
<p>the same manner as the devotees do. I have resided all my life in Bombay. I am
</p>
<p>a subscriber to the Sa't/a Prakash newspaper. I may have read the article upon
</p>
<p>which tliis action is brought. The ^ati/a Prakash is now amalgamated with the East Go/tar.
</p>
<p>62
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  I have never been to the principal seats in India,
</p>
<p>nor have I seen the Maharajs vi^orshipped by the rajahs, and v?hat I have said about
</p>
<p>the Maharajs is what I have heard about them. I have recollection of an unpleasant
</p>
<p>controversy which was going on in 1911-12 (1855) between the Maharajs and the
</p>
<p>Brahmins. The controversy related to our religion ; I was engaged in it against the
</p>
<p>Maharajs. I don't remember Lalmaneejee Maharaj issuing an order eight years ago, calling
</p>
<p>upon members of his caste to repair to his house and to give him presents ; neither
</p>
<p>did Lallmunjee Maharaj give such an order ten years ago. I do not recollect incurring
</p>
<p>the displeasure of Lallmunjee for denying his right to ask for presents. I have not
</p>
<p>heard of the complaints among the VuUabhacharyas of the adulterous practices of the
</p>
<p>Maharajs with their wives and daughters, but I have read some complaints in the Satya
</p>
<p>Prakash and Parsee Punch, which I first began to read about five or six years ago.
</p>
<p>I have not signed a paper prepared by the Maharajs binding me, to implicit obedience,
</p>
<p>especially with reference to these accusations ; but many persons have signed such a paper,
</p>
<p>which I have heard was prepared by the Maharaj. I have heard from the Banians,
</p>
<p>members of the sect, that an engagement has been entered into by Banians, Bhattias,
</p>
<p>and all the sects to do their utmost to prevent the Maharajs from being called as
</p>
<p>witnesses in a court of justice. This engagement has been designated the ' slavery bond'
</p>
<p>by those printers and newspaper writers. I can't say whether others call it so. I have
</p>
<p>not signed this bond. It is true that to get the bond signed, the Maharajs kept the
</p>
<p>temple closed eight days. This was about four years ago. I do not know of any attempt
</p>
<p>being made by the Maharajs to get Karsandass excommunicated from the caste of
</p>
<p>Banians for writing articles against them. Such an attempt was made. Two persons
</p>
<p>came -to me and said that as the Bhattias had made an arrangement we should make
</p>
<p>it also : this was but a day or two after the signatures were obtained, to intimidate
</p>
<p>witnesses to give evidence in this case against the Maharaj. One was Purboodass, and
</p>
<p>the other Jaykissondass. They are both Banians, so am I, and so is the defendant.
</p>
<p>Purboodass is the person who is managing the case for the plaintiff in this present
</p>
<p>action, and is sitting down in Court behind the professional advisers on the part of the
</p>
<p>plaintiff. He came to me once only about the business of excommunication. I said
</p>
<p>that if what Karsandass had published is false, the Court will punish him, I refused
</p>
<p>to interfere, as the Maharaj had brought an action against him : they went away. I
</p>
<p>can't say that they knew whether I was going to give evidence for the defendant in
</p>
<p>this action. The Maharajs are not the preceptors or spiritual guides of all the Hindus,

</p>
<p>but only of the Bhattias and Banians and Brahmins. The majority of the Banians believe ia
</p>
<p>the Maharajs. Some of the Banians are Jains. Jain Banians don't believe in the Maharajs.
</p>
<p>I have not heard of any Banians regarding the Maharaj as Almighty God incarnate
</p>
<p>in the flesh. I cannot say whether Bhattias regard the Maharaj as the incarnation of
</p>
<p>the Deity, but some may believe in the Maharaj as the incarnation of God, while
</p>
<p>others do not. [Mr. Anstey.  Do the whole sect of Vullubhacharya regard the Maharajs
</p>
<p>as Gods f] I cannot say what they think. Some people do say that they are gods,
</p>
<p>whi'e some deny that they are. (Mr. Anstey here read a portion of so much of the
</p>
<p>first averment of a plea to the witness in which the doctrine of the sect was laid down.)
</p>
<p>It is the opinion of the Vullubhacharyas, that the Maharajs and their descendants are
</p>
<p>incarnations of Bramah and Vishnu, and deserve to be worshipped with the mind,
</p>
<p>property and body of their followers. I believe it to be a sin ot the gravest character
</p>
<p>to neglect this worship. I cannot say if it is the duty of female devotees (as stated
</p>
<p>63
</p>
<p>in the plea) to lore the Maharajs and to be connected in adultery and lust with them.
</p>
<p>If such doctrine or passage was shown me in any of the books I call Shastras, I
</p>
<p>would take it as good and true. Referring to the " bundobust" (arrangement) I meant
</p>
<p>to refer to the Conspiracy Case of the Queen vs. Goculdass Leladhur and others. I
</p>
<p>heard the arrangement was to prevent any person from giving evidence here on behalf
</p>
<p>of Karsandass : and the " bundobust" I was asked to sign was to the same effect.
</p>
<p>The Maharajs decide caste disputes, and also themselves fall into caste disputes. I do
</p>
<p>not know if some castes have had to complain of the Maharajs seizing the property of
</p>
<p>widows and orphans ; I have never heard such a thing. The Maharajs have
</p>
<p>temples in Bombay : sometimes when there are marriages and such occasions, dancing
</p>
<p>and singing go on in the temples ; but not in the part where the idols are kept.
</p>
<p>Prostitutes are invited on such occasions to dance in the temple. Prostitutes are
</p>
<p>also invited to the party. In those temples the jNIaharajs worship the idols, and
</p>
<p>men and women worship, sometimes, the Maharajs. They prostrate themselves at the
</p>
<p>Maharaj's feet. By worshipping the Maharaj, I understand applying to him scent and stuff,
</p>
<p>and offering him fruits and flowers, in the same way as the idols are worshipped.
</p>
<p>When we fall down before the Maharaj, he blesses us. One mode of worshipping the
</p>
<p>idol is by swinging it, and our women worship the Maharaj by swinging him in a
</p>
<p>swing. On certain occasions the Maharaj throws golal (red powder used during the
</p>
<p>Holee holidays) on the person of men and women. It is thrown from a distance, and
</p>
<p>it may fall upon the necks and breasts of women. It is not considered among our
</p>
<p>people equivalent to adultery to throw golal on the breast of a woman. If any person
</p>
<p>throw golal on the breast of a woman, our people don't consider it indecent or shameful.
</p>
<p>I do not know if other people consider so. I have not heard of any Maharaj touching
</p>
<p>the breast of any of my relatives or of any other female. The pan soparree thrown off by
</p>
<p>the Maharaj is taken in hand and eaten by his devotees. The water rinsed and wrung
</p>
<p>from the Mahara s dkotia (trovvser) is drunk by his devotees and is known as char-
</p>
<p>namrut, ^. e., ambroisa or the nectar of the feet. Some portion of the remnants of
</p>
<p>the food eaten by the Maharaj is eaten by the followers. The water with which the
</p>
<p>Maharaj bathes is not drunk. I have been only three or four times in the year to visit
</p>
<p>the Maharaj.' The Maharaj sees men and women in the same open space. I don't
</p>
<p>know if there are rooms of the jNIaharaj to which females only have access. If the
</p>
<p>Maharaj has a family, he keeps a separate " zenana" in the temple. I do not recollect
</p>
<p>whether two or three years ago a meeting of the Bhattias was held with the view to

<p>prevent females from going to the Maharaj in his private rooms.
</p>
<p>Ee-examined by Mr. Bayley.  " Plaintiff was not in Bombay four years ago.
</p>
<p>People of our caste follow the customs and usages of our ancestors ; while some others
</p>
<p>follow the Shastres and religious instructors. They take their opinions from the gooroos
</p>
<p>or Brahmins. I have never been to a dance at the Maharaj's temple. The Maharajs
</p>
<p>usually reside in the Temple on one side, or in a separate dwelling-house, sometimes
</p>
<p>in a place within the compound, and sometimes in a house opposite to the temple.
</p>
<p>There are doors and entrances between the house and the temples. The dances take
</p>
<p>place in the house on one side, and sometimes in the compound of the temple. All
</p>
<p>nautch 'dancers in Bombay are prostitutes. Nautch- dances are frequently given by res-
</p>
<p>pectable persons on occasions of the celebration of marriages and other events. The
</p>
<p>plaintiff is married and has children. The Maharajs object to come and give evidence
</p>
<p>in courts. They would not incur anybody's displeasure if they came here ; but as
</p>
<p>64
</p>
<p>they might be detained two or three days, they would be prevented from the usual
</p>
<p>ceremonies and practices in the temple. When I say " worship the Maharaj," I mean
</p>
<p>that when we wish to invite the Maharaj to our house, we fetch him to our house,
</p>
<p>we offer him flowers, wave a light round him, present him money, and prostrate
</p>
<p>ourselves at his feet. We do not worship the God ; the Maharnjs do that. They bathe
</p>
<p>the image in several ways : they wash it in saffron, flowers, &c., dress it, wave a
</p>
<p>light round it, and then men and women go to worship before it. Kone touch the
</p>
<p>image except tlie Maharaj and particular servants of his, who are appointed to the
</p>
<p>office. The gnlal is thrown about during the Hoolee festival : it is a kind of powder
</p>
<p>prepared from wood called " Patanghoe." It is usual among the Hindus to throw it :
</p>
<p>it is an ancient custom, and I cannot explain it. Now 1 am an old man, and I
</p>
<p>don't throw it : when I was young I used to do so.
</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  "AVhen I said two people of the caste come to me and
</p>
<p>said ' the Bhattias have mnde bimdobust, and that we ought to make bundobust also,"
</p>
<p>I indended " we" to mean the Bania caste.
</p>
<p>To Sir M. R. Sausse  " When I say " worship the Maharaj," I don't mean to say
</p>
<p>it is the same thing to worship the Maharaj just as he worships the image : there is
</p>
<p>a slight difference between the two The image is bathed and dressed, and food is
</p>
<p>presented to it ; but the same is not done to the Maharaj. The Maharaj eats of the
</p>
<p>food presented to the in.age, and also distributes it among the Vyshnavs.
</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  " When the Maharaj worships the image, I consider him
</p>
<p>to worship God. When I wave the light round the Maharaj and prostrate belore him,
</p>
<p>I don't consider him as an incarnation of the Deity.
</p>
<p>To Sir M. R. Sausse.  " I have said there are some of the Bhattias and Baniat
</p>
<p>who consider the Maharaj as an incarnation of God. I cannot say if the majority or
</p>
<p>minority of the Bania caste hold that cr ed. I cannot say if the number of persons
</p>
<p>holding such belief has increased or diminished within the last few years."
</p>
<p>(The Couri rose at 5 p. M.  Throughout the day the hall of justice was excessively

<p>crowded by followers of the Maharajs, and peace was maintained by a select band of

<p>Sa/ya Prakash containing the libel for which this action is brought. I was a subscriber
</p>
<p>to the Salya Prakash. This is a copy of the 8atya Prakash of the 21st October
</p>
<p>1860, in which I see an article about the primitive religion of the Hindus. I observe
</p>
<p>in it the name of Jadoonathjee Maharaj introduced, the plaintiff in this case. I have
</p>
<p>not heard of any other Jadoonathjee Maharaj.
</p>
<p>65
</p>
<p>Cross-examined- by Mr. Anstey.  " I give as much respect to this Maharaj as to any
</p>
<p>other ; but the love of the people towards him, since the pubUcation of this article,
</p>
<p>has somewhat diminished. I remember his arrival from Surat about two years ago.
</p>
<p>I have not heard of any complaint from Jadoonathjee, since his arrival that people
</p>
<p>did not respect him and the other Maharajs as they ought to do. (Mr. Anstey
</p>
<p>hands a paper to the witness, and repeats the question.) I don't remember to have
</p>
<p>ever read this paper before. I have not heard of Jadoonathjee complaining of the
</p>
<p>neglect of his followers towards himself and other Maharajs, previously to the year
</p>
<p>1860, and before the arrival of plaintiff, I did not hear the Vyshnavs complain that
</p>
<p>the Maharajs did not give them proper instruction and advice in matters of religion. We
</p>
<p>used to go before the Maharajs, to prostrate ourselves before them, to go to the idol
</p>
<p>and to return. They did not give any other instructions except those connected with
</p>
<p>Brahma. Ihose instructions are given only once in a life time. Plaintiff used to say
</p>
<p>that if the Vyshnavs came to him and asked him any thing, he would answer them.
</p>
<p>Plaintiff did not, to my knowledge, complain that they did not come to him. I have
</p>
<p>not heard him say so. I did not hear the plaintiff say that he would give instruction
</p>
<p>to those only who came to ask him. I have not heard the Maharaj say that, according
</p>
<p>to the Shastras, the gooroo should not give instruction without being asked by the
</p>
<p>pupil, nor that, giving instruction without being asked is to give food to one who is
</p>
<p>not hungry. The company or society of Vyshnavs, not the Maharaj, published a reli-
</p>
<p>gious magazine. The Society is known as " the propagator of the Vyshnav religion."
</p>
<p>Thev inserted my name and sent me message to the effect that I was made a member
</p>
<p>of the Society. Plaintiff is at the head of the Society. I have not heard that
</p>
<p>Jadoonathjee has called upon all the Vyshnavs to come forward and support the magazine,
</p>
<p>nor have I read a handbill to that effect. I do not remember the name of the

<p>magazine. I believe the name of the magazine is " Svadhurma Varkhak" (propagator of
</p>
<p>our religion.) The Vyshnav families in Bombay are numerous. I cannot say if they
</p>
<p>are ten thousand. The Marjadees (strict observers of ceremonies) are the Bhattias. I
</p>
<p>have not heard of Jadoonathjee complaining that, out of so many Marjadees, only one
</p>
<p>hundred have subscribed to the magazine, and that, out of so many Banias, only 120
</p>
<p>have subscribed thereto. I have not heard him complain so. The Maharaj does not
</p>
<p>practise any tyranny, what tyranny is it ? By connection with Brahma I mean the chanting
</p>
<p>of mystic verse relating to the worship of Brahma. I don't read Sanscrit. By God
</p>
<p>I mean Krishna. The verse was not explained to me in Gujeratee. I believe the

</p>
<p>meaning of the verse was once explained to me by some Brahmin. In my opinion,
</p>
<p>the Maharaj is a representative of Krishna (This answer was extracted from witness
</p>
<p>on the threat of a fine of Ks. 100 from the Bench.) It is not that I hesitate to
</p>
<p>answer these questions against the Maharaj, for the fear that I may be born again in
</p>
<p>the condition of a bird or dog. [Mr, Bayley objected to the Court being taken into
</p>
<p>such excursive details. Sir M. Sausse remarked that the libel was of such an extemsive
</p>
<p>nature, that the Court must go into the details. The objection was overruled. Mr. Bayley
</p>
<p>again objected that this line of examination was not pertinent to the matter at issue. Sir
</p>
<p>M. Sausse.  What is the question ? Mr. Anstey.  That Krishna is your protector, that
</p>
<p>therefore you surrender to him your mind, body, wealth, wife, sons, children, and every
</p>
<p>thing else ? The objection is overruled.] Yes, the sense of this Sanscrit passage is,
</p>
<p>that Krishna is my protector, and that I, who am destroyed by internal misery and
</p>
<p>pain, do surrender to Krishna my mind, body, my breath, my heart, my feelings, as
</p>
<p>9
</p>
<p>66
</p>
<p>also my wife, my house, my children, my relations, my wealth, and other worldly things,
</p>
<p>together with my soul. Some five or seven thousand Banias assemble at a caste feast.
</p>
<p>Besides these there may be five or ten thousand Jains. It is true that about half the
</p>
<p>Bania caste (the Jains) don't believe in the Maharaj. There are two sects of Banias
</p>
<p> believers and unbelievers.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey.  Do some Banias believe the Maharaj to be a God ?
</p>
<p>Witness.  " We consider him to be our gooroo.
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse.  Tell witness if he does not answer the question, he will be
</p>
<p>sent to jail.
</p>
<p>Witness.  ""WTiat is the precise question ? (Interpreter explains) Some consider the
</p>
<p>Maharaj a god in the shape of gooroo.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey,  Is Gooroo a God ?
</p>
<p>Witness.  " Gooroo is gooroo.
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse.  Tell him if he does not answer the question, most indubitably
</p>
<p>will he go to jail.
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould.  Tell him he is asked what others believe, not as to his
</p>
<p>own belief.
</p>
<p>Witness.:  " I don't know if others believe him as God ; I consider him as simply
</p>
<p>a gooroo. I don't know under what name others worship him. There is no " bundo-
</p>
<p>bust" in my caste, to prevent witnesses from giving evidence in this case in behalf of
</p>
<p>Karsandass. I was not asked to join in such " bundobust." I have not been to the
</p>
<p>plaintiff's attorney to give instructions,  I went to him for my own case which is
</p>
<p>pending. I am not a Marjadee. I don't know of my caste people going to the " Kas
</p>
<p>mandalee." I don't know what sort of thing it is. There is no festival among the
</p>
<p>Vallabhacharyas in which married men and women mix promiscuously in a room. I
</p>
<p>may have read in the libel article a reference to the Kas festival ; but there is
</p>
<p>nothing of the sort in my caste. I do not know anything of the history of the
</p>
<p>Vallabhacharya sect. My only reason for believing the Maharajs to be of high
</p>
<p>caste, is that even Brahmins believe them. I don't know if those Brahmins are
</p>
<p>few or many. The Maharajs are originally Telinga Brahmins. I don't know if the
</p>
<p>Maharajs, on account of their practices, were outcasted by the Telinga Brahmins for
</p>
<p>Bome hundred years. I don't know if they are so outcasted at present by the Telinga
</p>
<p>Brahmins. I have never heard of a Maharaj intermarr^^ing in a Brahmin family.
</p>
<p>Males and females of my family visit the Maharaj. We worship him when he

</p>
<p>comes to our house : we don't go to his house to worship him. I have not at any
</p>
<p>time swallowed the spittle and leavings of pan soparee thrown out by the Maharaj ;
</p>
<p>but I have sometimes partaken of the remnants of his food. My family may have
</p>
<p>eaten the leavings of his food but not the pan soparee thrown out. In the month
</p>
<p>of Sliraican, the image is swung in a swing ; if the Maharaj also sits therein,
</p>
<p>we swing him. The females of my and other families have swung him. The Ma-
</p>
<p>haraj has thrown golcd on thousands of females, not the females of my family alone,
</p>
<p>By Thackorjee I mean Krishna. I don't think that throwing the golal makes women
</p>
<p>67
</p>
<p>pregnant. It is not the fact that young men throw golal and not the old. Throwing
</p>
<p>the goJal has no relation to sexual intercourse. I would consider it a great insult
</p>
<p>for any other person, but the Muharaj, to throw golal upon my wife. Throwing
</p>
<p>golal IVom a distance I don't consider as an outrage upon chastity. (Witness is fined
</p>
<p>fifty rupees for not gi^'ing a direct answer.) 1 cannot explain why it is an insult
</p>
<p>to throw golal on a female at any other time but the llolee holiday. I have not
</p>
<p>heard any complaint of the Maharajs handling the breasts or necks of females in
</p>
<p>playfulness. Complaints similar to this have been published in :he Safya Prakask.
</p>
<p>I have not read the Parsee Punch, the Summachar, or the Summachar Durpun.
</p>
<p>I subscribe to the Jami- Jamah ed, but don't recollect reading therein any thing of the
</p>
<p>kind, (Mr. Anstey reads a list of all the vernacular papers.) I have not read any of
</p>
<p>these papers. I subscribed only to the Satya Prakash and the Jami-Jamshed. (Mr.
</p>
<p>Anstey hands witness an article published in the last-mentioned paper six or seven
</p>
<p>years ago, containing an expose " which must put to shame the followers of the
</p>
<p>Maharaj.") I don't recollect having read this article.
</p>
<p>Re-examined by Mr. Scoble.  " T have been asked as to swinging the image and
</p>
<p>the Mahara'. It is a ceremony performed on certain religious and festival days. It
</p>
<p>is performed publicly, in the presence of men and women belonging to the Vyshnav
</p>
<p>persuasion. Throwing the golal is also part of our religious ceremonies during the
</p>
<p>Holee holidays. The golal which remains after throwing over the idol, is thrown over
</p>
<p>the worshippers. [Mr. Scoble.  You are fined fifty rupees for not understanding why it is an
</p>
<p>insult for a stranger to throw ^^rofo' upon your wife Sir M. Sausse.  Mr. Sci ble has misun-
</p>
<p>derstood why the witness was fined fifty rupees. It was for evasion, prevarication, and delay.
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould.  The Court would not fine a witness for not understanding a question,
</p>
<p>and your assuming that it did so fine him, is assuming what you have no right to
</p>
<p>assume. Mr. Scoble offered an explanation, and the examination continued.]  " If the
</p>
<p>Maharaj or Gosaei handled the breast or neck of a female, it would be considered
</p>
<p>adultery  not so his throwing golal on females from a short distance. I have been
</p>
<p>present at the marriages of Maharajs. It is not lawful for a Brahmin to marry out
</p>
<p>of his caste.
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  "As we cannot touch and swing the image of the Deity, we
</p>
<p>swing the Maharaj. Wlien we do so, we regard him as our gooroo. The Maharaj is
</p>
<p>the only gooroo of those of the sect who wear " Kantees" (necklaces of beads,) and
</p>
<p>who are known as Vyshnavs."

<p>(4) Vurjeevundass Mahdoicdass, examined by Mr. Bayley.  " I am a justice of
</p>
<p>the peace of Bombay. I belong to the Bania caste. I know the plaintiff. I have
</p>
<p>known the plaintiff these last two years since his arrival in Bombay. I am a shet of
</p>
<p>my caste, and one of the members of the Mahajan. The Maharaj is a priest of the
</p>
<p>Bhattias, Lohanas and lianias. The plaintiff is a gooroo or spiritual guide and Brahmin
</p>
<p>by caste. He is in a higher position than the ordinary Brahmins. 'J he Maharajs are
</p>
<p>looked upon as descendants of the Vallabacharyas. The plaintiff has no temple in
</p>
<p>Bombay. Maharajs are looked up to with respect by the Hindus, particularly by
</p>
<p>our sect.
</p>
<p>Cross examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I deny that I was ever called upon to give
</p>
<p>68
</p>
<p>evidence in a court of justice against a man charged with double murder. My name
</p>
<p>was not mentioned in a native paper in regard to that matter. I have seen a paper
</p>
<p>containing that charge signed by Mr. Forjett. That was about five years ago. I am
</p>
<p>brother of the witness Gopalldass Madowdass. I do not know whether my brother wa
</p>
<p>in opposition to any of the Maharajs, except to Jeevunjee Maharaj, in respect to a
</p>
<p>dispute between some Brahmins. I do not know the history of the sect of the
</p>
<p>Vallabhacharyas, nor whether he was the son of one Luxmon Bhut. Maharajs were
</p>
<p>originally Telinga Brahmins, but have not heard that they are outcastes. I have not
</p>
<p>heard that Brahmins eat with them One-half of my caste are Jains ; they do not
</p>
<p>worship the Maharaj ; they are Bhuddists. Some worship the Maharaj as well aa Shiva,
</p>
<p>and those who worship Vishnu, have a reserved worship for Shiva. Some persons
</p>
<p>when they abandon the worship of Shiva, worship the Maharaj. I do not know whether
</p>
<p>the Kaja of Porebunder was disgusted with the worship of a Maharaj on account of hia
</p>
<p>immoralities. I do not know why a Maharaj was flogged by the Portuguese autho-
</p>
<p>rities at Damaun. An application was made for the release of a Maharaj who had
</p>
<p>been imprisoned at Jaluapatan. The Maharajs adopt sons from their own sects, and they
</p>
<p>become priests by adoption. It may be criminal in the eyes of the Hindu religion to expose
</p>
<p>the vices of their parents, but I do not consider it so. The Maharajs wash their
</p>
<p>own bodies on their birthdays or rehgious days, and we - throw saffron and other
</p>
<p>Bcent on their persons. The image, too, is washed with saffron water on these sacred
</p>
<p>days. The females also sprinkle saffron on the Maharaj's person and they consider
</p>
<p>the touching of his feet as sacred. I do not know if the dust on which he walks is
</p>
<p>regarded as sacred. If a Maharaj dies we do not say he is dead, but that he has
</p>
<p>joined play or amorous love in heaven between men and women. I am not able to
</p>
<p>state whether it is a part of our sect that Krishna had intercourse with 16,000 women,
</p>
<p>and that they had salvation thereby. I do not know that the Maharajs are called
</p>
<p>the Avtar of the Maha Prabhoo. The Maharajs have imposed a tax on the gains of
</p>
<p>the Bhattia and grain merchants that fall on the community. There was a meeting
</p>
<p>held at the plaintiff's house for considering the re-marriage question and opposing it.
</p>
<p>I do not know when the Vishnu Punch was started. I have not drunk the water
</p>
<p>wrung out of the Maharaj's lungotees after bathing, nor that with which his right
</p>
<p>toes are washed. Some people drink such water. I have not sighed the bundobust to
</p>
<p>help Karsandass in this action, nor do I know if my brother has signed it. I know
</p>
<p>only from the newspapers that my brother was asked to sign it. I signed a document

</p>
<p>by which we agreed that no members of the caste should call upon a Maharaj to give
</p>
<p>evidence in a court of justice ; if they did so they would be expelled. We intended
</p>
<p>also to memoriahze the Judges of the Supreme Court, and if this Court did not grant
</p>
<p>us exemption we would appeal to the Privy Council to be relieved. The temples
</p>
<p>were closed for 8 days in order that the followers should sign the document. Maharajs
</p>
<p>visit the steamers, shops, and nautch parties, but do not like to come to this Court
</p>
<p>as they have not done so from time immemorial. (Mr. Anstey.  How do you say
</p>
<p>time immemorial, when your sect has been in existence only 400 years.) Our
</p>
<p>sect has been in existence only 400 years. Goverdhunathjee Maharaj was a large
</p>
<p>trader ; he received visits from and paid visits to Parsee and Mahomedan traders. I
</p>
<p>know nothing of the Mahomedan mistress of Vachallaljee Maharaj. I do not know
</p>
<p>if there is such a book containing verses written by the plaintiff. I have not read it.
</p>
<p>There is a sepai-ate zenana where all the ladies go to visit the Maharaj's wives. The
</p>
<p>69
</p>
<p>devotes are allowed to see the image eight times a day. I have sometimes heard that
</p>
<p>women's dresses are handled indecently in the crowd, and their persons disgraced. In
</p>
<p>the winter the men and women attend at so early an hour as 4 o'clock. I did drive
</p>
<p>the Maharaj's carriage as coachman ; I do not consider it disgraceful to do so. I did
</p>
<p>not slight the late Governor Lord Elphinstone while driving in public in order to pay
</p>
<p>respect to our Maharaj. Before the publication of the libel I have read in some of
</p>
<p>the papers that the Maharajs were in the habit of committing adultery. This was
</p>
<p>about 4 years ago. There was a talk amongst members of the Vallabhacharya caste.
</p>
<p>I do not know if any replies were made to this. There was a talk, I believe, among
</p>
<p>the Bhattias that their females should go at proper hours to the temples of the
</p>
<p>Maharajas The women were to go only in the morning and evening. This was about
</p>
<p>ten months ago. I am not on bad terms with the defendant, I have been attacked
</p>
<p>by him in his newspaper. The attack was made on account of some caste disputes.
</p>
<p>I took no notice of the article. I do not read the doctrines of my sect ; I learn them
</p>
<p>by hearsay from the Gujerati Brahmins.
</p>
<p>Ee-examined by Mr. Bayley.  " I am still a justice of the peace, and do not think
</p>
<p>my character injured in any way by what is called the double murder by Government
</p>
<p>or any other body. The charges were without foundation. I have merely heard
</p>
<p>that the Maharaj was found dead ; I know nothing further about it. The plaintiff
</p>
<p>said if the Shastras allowed him to support the re-marriage of widows he would allow it,
</p>
<p>but if they did not allow, he would not allow it. There was some discussion, but I
</p>
<p>have not heard how it was settled. Visknoo Punch means Vishnoo assembly and not
</p>
<p>a caricature. These articles that I saw had no effect on my mind as to the character
</p>
<p>of the Maharaj. I frequent the Maharaj's temple. Several people are kept at the
</p>
<p>temple to keep order. They regulate the admission of people into the temple.
</p>
<p>They enter into one passage and go out of the other. The defendant attacked me
</p>
<p>three or four times in his paper, but I thought the attack too contemptible to notice it."
</p>
<p>Third Day, Tuesday, 28th January 1862.
</p>
<p>(5.) Runchor Munjee examined by Mr. Bayley.  " I am a merchant, and have
</p>
<p>visited many parts of India on pilgrimages. I have been to the great cities on the
</p>
<p>banks of the Ganges and the Jumna. I have not been further than Porebunder
</p>
<p>towards the West. There were Maharajs in many of the places I visited, in others
</p>
<p>there were not. I believe there are in India some 40 or 50 Maharajs. There were
</p>
<p>two Maharajs at Benares. In a religious point of view, the Hindus, as well as the

</p>
<p>native princes, regard the Maharajs as gooroos. The Maharajs are Brahmins, and are
</p>
<p>looked up to and respected by other Brahmins.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr- Anstey.  " The whole world say that the Maharajs are Brahmins.
</p>
<p>I don't know if they are outcasted Brahmins. I have not heard so, I have not been to Telinga
</p>
<p>country : it is said the Maharajs belong to the Telinga country. I have had no conversation
</p>
<p>70
</p>
<p>with any Brahmins about the Maharajs. I used to see many Brahmins sitting at th
</p>
<p>Maharaj's when I used to visit him, sometimes five, sometimes ten, sometime twenty-five.
</p>
<p>I can't say if they were there for asking alms, they often come to me for alms. I
</p>
<p>never saw a Krahmin eating with a Maharaj. I am a Bania and a Vyshnav. I
</p>
<p>have dim eyes and am not now able to read. I have read the story of " the 84
</p>
<p>Vyshnovs," also " the story of the 252," (witness does not say 252 what !) I have
</p>
<p>read another book called the " Instruction Paper." I have not read any of the lite-
</p>
<p>rary publications of Judunathjee, the plaintiff. I have read, either in the 84 book or
</p>
<p>the 252 story book, the story of Krishnadass carrying his wife on his shoulders for
</p>
<p>the purpose of her fulfilling an adulterous engagement which she had made with another
</p>
<p>Bania. [Mr. Anstey.  Is the conduct of the husband approved or censured in the
</p>
<p>book ? Mr. Bayley objects to the question being put ; his learned friend might aa
</p>
<p>well examine the witness on the contents of the Bible. Mr. Anstey read a few sen-
</p>
<p>tences from the plaint, showing that the question was necessary to disprove an allegation
</p>
<p>in the plaint. The objection was overruled.] The conduct of the husband, the wife,
</p>
<p>and the third party in the story is praised. The good faith of the wife to her pro-
</p>
<p>mise is particularly praised. I don't know the story of the Bheel who killed his wife
</p>
<p>for adultery with a Thackorjee, who re-animated the wife and stamped her as a virtuous
</p>
<p>woman. I am ignorant of a story in which a Maharaj declined to commit adultery
</p>
<p>with one Gunga in a privy, but afterwards made her pregnant in a dream. Not being
</p>
<p>acquainted with the Shastrns, I cannot say whether or not these stories are repugnant
</p>
<p>to religion or morality in one sense. I ought to act according to what is enjoined in
</p>
<p>our Shastras, but I think one ought to be mindful of his belly before he learns the
</p>
<p>Shastras. I do not know the ten principles of the Vallabhacharyas. [Sir M. Sausse
</p>
<p>suggested if Mr. Anstey would think it necessary, to swell the depositions with the
</p>
<p>negative answers of the witness. Mr. Anstey.  This witness is called by the plaintiff
</p>
<p>to show the morality of tlie life which the Maharajs lead, and the high respect in
</p>
<p>which they are held, and I am bound to show the contrary. The witness seenw to
</p>
<p>know nothing, and yet he is called to give opinions on the virtuous life of his spiritual
</p>
<p>preceptors. My client being poor, it is unfortunate for him that the trial should be
</p>
<p>lengthened over as many days as the plaintiff's advisers could possibly do so. The
</p>
<p>objection was overruled.] I do not consider my gooroo to be an incarnation of the Deity.
</p>
<p>I cannot say if other men believe so. I am not a " Varkat," or a beggar who goes
</p>
<p>on pilgrimages. He begs only when necessary. Varkats are of the Lohana, Bhattia,

<p>and other castes. Some of them marry, others do not. A man can marry after having
</p>
<p>turned a Varkat. I have not heard if the Varkats act as procurers of women for the
</p>
<p>Maharajs. I have been present when the Maharaj has attended the sick bed of a
</p>
<p>dying person. I have heard that the Maharaj puts his foot on the breast of the dying
</p>
<p>person. I have not seen him do so. For putting his foot in this manner, the Maharaj
</p>
<p>gets from five to twenty-five rupees or any other amount, according to circumstances.
</p>
<p>He gets the money as gooroo. I know the festival called the Has festival, which is
</p>
<p>held at uncertain periods. Married and unmarried people of both sexes go as spectators
</p>
<p>to the festival. I am talking of the drama. I don't know what is called the " Ras
</p>
<p>mandali."
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  " The story to which I alluded is a sacred story and is so
</p>
<p>considered among my sect. The man had come to the wife's house, she gave him
</p>
<p>food, made an engagement with him to go to his place and fulfilled it. It was, I
</p>
<p>71
</p>
<p>presume, an adulterous engagement. The wife's conduct is praised in the story for
</p>
<p>keeping her engagement with the man, who was a hermit holy man.
</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  " It would not be considered in my sect a good thing
</p>
<p>if a woman visited a Maharaj for a similar purpose. The woman in the story did
</p>
<p>what she thought proper.
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  " The husband on hearing of the wife's engagement, said to
</p>
<p>her " I consider you now as my daughter ;" and the hermit, on hearing what had
</p>
<p>occurred, said to her, " You having fulfilled your engagement, I regard you as my
</p>
<p>daughter."
</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  " The moral of the story is that all the three parties
</p>
<p>were true to their faith as regarded the engagement.
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  " I believe, from the hermit having called the woman his
</p>
<p>daughter, that no sexual intercourse took place.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey.  Was it the Bania or the hermit who said to the woman, " I consider
</p>
<p>you as my daughter" ?
</p>
<p>Witness.  " It was the person from whom she brought food for the holy man.
</p>
<p>Mr. Scoble.  Your Lordship will find when the story is produced, that this man
</p>
<p>has told it all wrong !
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould.  I don't think it is worth following it up. It is a story without
</p>
<p>a moral after all !
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  " The holy man asked the woman for food ; she had no food
</p>
<p>in the house ; it must be provided somehow ; she went to a Bania for it, and it
</p>
<p>was to the Bania she made the engagement. The hermit ate the food ; and when
</p>

<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I cannot say how many of my sect there are
</p>
<p>in Bombay, perhaps ten, twenty, or fifty. I don't know the number of the Maharaj's

<p>what the consciences of others are."
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley.  That is the case for the plaintiff.
</p>
<p>DEFENCE.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey submitted to their Lordships as a jury, not as the Court, that there
</p>
<p>was no case made out by the plaintiff, and that, therefore, the defendants were entitled
</p>
<p>to a nonsuit. He trusted their Lordships would not hold that there was some evidence
</p>
<p>td go before a jury ; and even if tJietj did, that they would dismiss from their minds
</p>
<p>the seventh and eighth pleas and the issuess raised upon them, and would return a
</p>
<p>verdict upon the facts as regarded the first issue. To support this proposition he would
</p>
<p>cite the case of Robertson vs. McDougall (4th Bingham,) the doctrine laid down in
</p>
<p>which has been followed ever since. And it is so laid down by Mr. Wingrove Cooke
</p>
<p>in his work on Libel, viz., that it is not for the Court to give any opinion, at an
</p>
<p>early stage of the proceedings, upon the justification. Mr. Anstey would ask for a
</p>
<p>nonsuit on the first issue, that of not guilty, on three grounds. First, he would say
</p>
<p>this document (the article) was not a libel, and per se, secondly, that the plaintiff has
</p>
<p>not proved his inuendoes, not a single inuendo, whereby the libel is pointed ; and
</p>
<p>thirdly, tliat the document, as appeared from the evidence of the plaintiffs own witnesses,
</p>
<p>was published upon justifiable grounds and upon a justifiable occasion. If their Lordships
</p>
<p>should think that there was some evidence, however infinitesimally small, to go before
</p>
<p>the Court, then he must say he would take the benefit of these observations. He
</p>
<p>urged, however, that he was entitled to the Court's verdict on the first issue. On the
</p>
<p>second issue, though the plaintiff produced no proof, or rather the proof produced by
</p>
<p>him disproved his plaint, Mr. Anstey would say it resulted upon the evidence that
</p>
<p>these persons called Maharajs, most improperly so called, are not the preceptors of
</p>
<p>religion, and none of them has any right to sue in that character There is no evidence
</p>
<p>offered at the Bar to prove, there was some apparently to disprove, that they are high
</p>
<p>priests. The sect of the Vallabhacharyas is a contemptible sect of 400 years old, and

</p>
<p>not an ancient ruling sect, as the plaintiff has averred. Mr. Anstey said the first five
</p>
<p>issues were proved by plaintiffs witnesses for defendants ; and he did not prove some
</p>
<p>issues at all. The learned counsel's two objections were that the libel is not a libel,
</p>
<p>and therefore, per se, the Court ought to regard the libel as it is, without any regard
</p>
<p>whatever to the inuendoes. The plaintiff has not proved the characters he ascribes to
</p>
<p>himself in the plaint ; his witnesses have proved that he has them not, and, therefore,
</p>
<p>he has no right in any of those assumed characters to sue. Before proceeding to read
</p>
<p>the material portions of the libel, Mr. Anstey wished to have the libel entered as
</p>
<p>read along with the documents to which it refers ; otherwise he should object to its
</p>
<p>being entered as read.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley.  The learned counsel may put what construction he pleases ; the libel
</p>
<p>has been entered as read.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey.  Then the documents to which it refers must be taken as also read.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley objects to the proposal.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey.  Then I insist upon the libel being read, and I will make my objections.
</p>
<p>The Prothonotary reads the article containing the libel.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey applied to have read the documents in which Jadoonathjee says that
</p>
<p>" in the same way as some one goes from the gates of the Fort to proceed to Wal-
</p>
<p>keshwur, and some one to Byculla," &c., and also the commentary of Goculnathjee
</p>
<p>referred to in the libel. The learned counsel applied on the ground that the plaintiff
</p>
<p>is bound to produce all references in the article of which he complains His not having
</p>
<p>produced them had deprived the defendants' counsel of hi.s right of referring to and
</p>
<p>commenting upon them. In support of his argument the learned gentlemen cited Solomon
</p>
<p>vs. LaicsoH (15th vol. Law Journal) in which the Court held that there was variance,
</p>
<p>owing to one of the letters only being produced, and no mention made of a second
</p>
<p>letter in the count, which was referred to in the first. Lord Kenyon held that the
</p>
<p>other letter ought to have been also set out.
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse.  They both togetlier made a libel, and, therefore, it was argued
</p>
<p>that one ought to have been incorporated in the other.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey.  I rely much more on the second case, Cart>rrigJtt vs. Bri(jh', in
</p>
<p>which it was laid down as a maxim. What I am arguing for is this, that, according
</p>
<p>to these cases, references in this document ought to have been set out. 'Jhe libel is
</p>
<p>said to be against the sect, against every member of it, and jigahist the plaintiff!
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse.  The libel does not say that Jadoonathjee wrote the reference. The
</p>
<p>words are " Jadoonathjee says" ; it does not show he wrote anything.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey.  Very well, my Lord, then I proceed to the other reference to Go-
</p>
<p>culnathjee's Commentary. The first thing to be proved is the libel, and then it must
</p>
<p>be shown with what intent it was wrilten. " Holding improper and heterodox opinions"
</p>
<p> that is what plaintiff is charged with in the first part of the article.
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould.  Defendants are debarred from asking for the referen<^e,
</p>
<p>from all the works of Goculnathjee, they select a passage in point to explain their
</p>
<p>meaning.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey proceeded to comment upon the different inuendoes, remarking that
</p>

</p>
<p>none of them was proved, and therefore the Court had no evidence before them of the
</p>
<p>sensHs verborum. Ihe Court has no judicial knowledge of what the religious opinions
</p>
<p>of the sect are ; there is no evidence to show what the doctrines of their religion are,
</p>
<p>and, therefore, as regards the sensus verborum, the case fails What is left to juries
</p>
<p>at home in such cases is  Given the sense, the plaintiffs meaning of tiie inuendo, was
</p>
<p>it in that sense that the words were written or spoken by the defendant of and con-
</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p>74
</p>
<p>cerning the plaintiff ? and, tlien, whether the construction put by the plaintiff is borne
</p>
<p>out bv the evidence. In Staple vs. Jones, it is laid down that if the meaning of
</p>
<p>the defamatory matter be obscure and cannot be made out, the alleged libel is non-
</p>
<p>actionable. In England, the rule is to take the words in their ordinary, popular sense.
</p>
<p>Now, what is the sense of heresy, heterodoxy, &c. ? In this country, interpreting such
</p>
<p>terms, the Court must take the surrounding circumstances into view.
</p>
<p>Sir Josepli Arnould.  We don't know what heterodoxy is, and we don't know what
</p>
<p>heresy is ; for we don't know what the Shastras themselves are.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey said it appeared from Brooke's Eeports that one of the courts in
</p>
<p>England refused to enter on its record an action in which a clergyman of a certain
</p>
<p>persuasion wanted to sue, and referred him to the court having proper cognizance of the
</p>
<p>matters concerned. What, then, is the course to be adopted ? The popular meaning
</p>
<p>is taken, the witness is asked if there is anything to give another meaning to the
</p>
<p>words, and, then, what did he himself understand by them ? Their Lordships could
</p>
<p>not read the Purans, or read the doctrines of modern times, to be then able to say
</p>
<p>what the heresy referred to in the libel is. There was no evidence to show what the
</p>
<p>heresy consisted in. There was evidence the other way. It was the evidence of witnesses
</p>
<p>that plaintifTs religion is of a modern date, and consequently he has established no
</p>
<p>standard.
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse.  There is, Mr. Anstey, great difficulty in the question. The stan-
</p>
<p>dard is not proved, nor is it proved when the Kali Yug set in.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey.  T say, my Lord, the libel is not alleged and proved.
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse.  As at present advised, we should read the clause leaving out the
</p>
<p>words " Shastras" and " Kali Yug," There is no evidence to show what they are.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey.  Tb.e onus of proving every inuendo lies upon the plaintiff" where
</p>
<p>the inuendo is material. I have already cited two cases to show that, and there are
</p>
<p>two other cases to which I will now refer, Grijfiths vs. Lewis (8 2. B. R.) and
</p>
<p>Golway vs. Marshall (9 Excheq. 94.) This brings me to a proposition to which I
</p>
<p>would call the serious attention of your Lordships, and to which I did not do justice
</p>
<p>in the recent Demurrer case. It is that, although it is competent to a person in his
</p>
<p>private character to recover damages, if the libel refers to his professional character, he
</p>
<p>cannot recover any, unless he prove  by first laying the foundation of proof by show-
</p>
<p>ing his professional character  what damages in his private character he has sustained
</p>
<p>by the libel. (Cites Mo,y vs. Brown and comments upon the points raised therein.)

</p>
<p>Kg evidence is given here to show that the Maharajs would be subjected to any
</p>
<p>punishment by the publication of the alleged libel. In the case I have cited, evidence
</p>
<p>was given of practices inconsistent with the doctrines of the Roman Catholic religion,
</p>
<p>and it was urged that the plaintiff" would incur the displeasure of his superiors, and
</p>
<p>yet the court granted a new trial for the important defect on the record. Nothing
</p>
<p>could compensate for such a defect on the record. The court held,  How could the
</p>
<p>words be actionable, for the manner in which the plaintiff could be injured was not
</p>
<p>shown, either in his private or professional character. Here there has been no averment
</p>
<p>of the manner and form in which the libel would have damnified the plaintiff, but positively
</p>
<p>he has given evidence to show that the witnesses treat the libel with great contempt.
</p>
<p>75
</p>
<p>One of them says -that although, since the publication of the libel, love towards the
</p>
<p>Maharaj has diminished, yet that respect has not. But there is no evidence of the manner
</p>
<p>in which the love has been lost, nor to show lehose love is meant. There is an
</p>
<p>utter absence of the averment both of manner and of form.
</p>
<p>Mr, Anstey had not done with his able speech ; and the Court rose at hall-
</p>
<p>past 5 P. M.
</p>
<p>Fourth Day, Thursday, ^Oth January, 1882.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey, resuming the thread of his observations of the previous day, alluded
</p>
<p>again to the case of May vs. Brown and cited two other cases, Lewis vs. Walton
</p>
<p>and Heine vs. Stovell, enlarging at some length upon the principal points mooted in
</p>
<p>each. A much more stronger case than Jifai/ vs. Brown, a case long subsequent to it,
</p>
<p>was that of the Queen vs. Burdett, in which Lord Teignmouth remarked that all the
</p>
<p>facts descriptive of the offence should be set out on the record, as also ali the refer-
</p>
<p>ences if they contained new matter. The learned counsel repeated, with fresh illustrations,
</p>
<p>what he said on a former occasion, pointing out the only difference between an action
</p>
<p>of libel and an action of slander.
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould.  Is your view somewhat this ?  When a libel is alleged
</p>
<p>against a person both in his private and official character, it is no libel unless it is
</p>
<p>Ktated on the record how he is injured in both capacities.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey stated this was shortly the substance of his argument. It was no
</p>
<p>libel to say of a clergyman that he was a " stupid fool," though it would be libel-
</p>
<p>lous to impute to him practical adultery. It is not actionable to say of a man in his
</p>
<p>clerical capacity that he is a robber and a cheat, though the same words applied to
</p>
<p>a tradesman would be indubitably libellous. According to the principles of the cases
</p>
<p>cited by Mr. Cooke in his book on libel, it is libellous to publish of a gunsmith that
</p>
<p>he slioots out of a leathern gun ; to say of a Eoman Catholic priest that he tries to
</p>
<p>convert Protestants by promises of money ; to say of a newspaper that it is low in
</p>
<p>circulation, although it is no libel to call it vulgar and scurrilous ; or to publish a
</p>
<p>story which may make a man ridiculous although he may have told it himself. An-
</p>
<p>other objection closely connected with the last one is this : Supposing all that the learned
</p>
<p>counsel had said, went to nothing and that it was necessary to proceed with the case
</p>
<p>in spite of the want of proper averment, the objection was that the plaintiff could not
</p>
<p>carry the libel further than the class to which it belongs. No doubt it is true that
</p>
<p>a libel on an individual may be a libel on a class ; but the averments being made,
</p>

</p>
<p>they are to be proved as such. That is the very point decided in Palmer vs. Malcolmson,
</p>
<p>the principle maintained being that, where the class is referred to, it must be proved
</p>
<p>that it is a libel on an individual. In all these ca^es, the surrounding circumstances
</p>
<p>must be looked to ; and this argument the learned counsel applied to the whole of
</p>
<p>the plaint. He said this was not a case in which, without looking to the surrounding
</p>
<p>circumstances, the Court could give its opinion that it was not a libel. This was
</p>
<p>properly a question for a jury. The plaintiff is bound to show how he is damnified
</p>
<p>76
</p>
<p>in his private and his official capacities ; and no introductory matter or inuendo can
</p>
<p>change the burden oF proof. The parts of the libel where the plaintiff is referred to, are
</p>
<p>parts where, the learned gentleman submitted, no libel certainly could be found. His
</p>
<p>name first occurs in an abstruse alhision to the doctrines of the Shastras and the latter
</p>
<p>days of the Kali Yug, which may be summed up thus : " the sect of the Maharajas
</p>
<p>has arisen in the Kali Yug, therefore, according to the doctrines of the Shastras, it
</p>
<p>must be false. Jadoonatlijee says that the original courses of the Veds and Purans
</p>
<p>having gone forward, have diverged into different ways. What a deceitful proposition
</p>
<p>this is." 'J'hfrc is nothing libellous in all this. Sir Kobert Philmore was a maintainer
</p>
<p>of all the filthiest abuses which disgraced English literature, and Mr. Locke did a public
</p>
<p>service in exposing and censuring such writings. Would any Englishman think Mr.
</p>
<p>Locke ought to have been prosecuted in an au-tion of libel ? The critic does great
</p>
<p>service to the public when he exposes a stupid book, and if the writer of it suffers
</p>
<p>any loss, it is a loss of fame and of profits to which he was not entitled.
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse  In the Demurrer case I expressed an opinion that the first part
</p>
<p>of the article is a common and historical comment ; and brother Arnould coincides in
</p>
<p>that opinion.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey therefore proceeded to the latter part of the libel in which the plaintiff
</p>
<p>is directly referred to : " Jadoonatlijee Maharaj ! should you wish to propagate or to
</p>
<p>spread abroad religion, then do you personally adopt a virtuous course of conduct, and
</p>
<p>admonish your other INIaharajas," &c. This passage and others are hypothetical state-
</p>
<p>ments and not a libel upon the class at large or upon any one individually. If the
</p>
<p>plaintiff makes the cap fit him 
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould.  There is no inuendo that the exhortation to adopt virtues per-
</p>
<p>sonally, implies the absence of them in plaintiff.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey remarked the defendant's object in writing down the doctrines of the sect
</p>
<p>was two -fold : first, because they are heretical, and secondly, because they were such as
</p>
<p>must lead to greater and more serious immorality hereafter. Some of the allusions were
</p>
<p>introduced merely for the illustration of his argument. It is a great amplification of the
</p>
<p>original stanza, says the libel, to say that the meaning of it is, Give your wives to adul-
</p>
<p>tery and your daughters to whoredom. What evidence the plaintiff has given is in favour
</p>
<p>of the libel, and the learned counsel would submit that if the doctrines mentioned in the
</p>
<p>criticism were contained in the sacred books of the sect, there was nothing adduced against
</p>
<p>the libel itself. ' In the Kali Yug many other heresies and many sects have arisen

</p>
<p>besides that of Val'abhachar^a, but no other sectaries have ever perpetrated such shame-
</p>
<p>le 8 less, subliiity," itc. The words in the passage are the sect of the Maharajas, not the
</p>
<p>class. The entire sect is hinted at, the sect of Vallabhacharyas or the Maharajas. The
</p>
<p>plaintiff sought to narrow and extend ihe meaning of " Maharajas" in the plaint and in
</p>
<p>the libel respectively. This inuendo, Mr. Anstey hoped, the Court would not allow. He
</p>
<p>would say the true meaning of the above passage is :  Of the many sects which have
</p>
<p>polluted India, none have exceeded the Vallabhacharyas as appears from their sacred
</p>
<p>books, and particularly the passage in the Commentary of Goculnathjee, to which reference
</p>
<p>has been made. He goes on to say :  " When we use such severe terms as these, our
</p>
<p>simple Hindu friends are wroth with us." What friends, the Maharajas ? no, but the
</p>
<p>entire sect  " we have to grieve over our Hindu friends and over their weak powers of
</p>
<p>77
</p>
<p>reflection." Connecting the whole of the passage with what follows, it is nothing more
</p>
<p>th'n a hypothesis  " Should you wish to propagate," &c., " then do you personally
</p>
<p>adopt," &c. " But when throwing dust in the eyes of simple people, the Maharajas write
</p>
<p>about enjoying tlie tender maidens," &c., " great flames spring within our inside, our pen
</p>
<p>becomes heated and on fire." Is this libellous ? The learned counsel could not think it
</p>
<p>was. If the Court decided otherwise, he thought that the whole body of missionaries from
</p>
<p>the East to the West, who preach against the immorality of heathenism or the debau-
</p>
<p>cheries of these monstrous religious preceptors, would be brought up for libel every day !
</p>
<p>The defendant, being a member of the Yallabhacharya sect, has a distinct, a direct
</p>
<p>interest in the debasing practices of his brethren, as well as a general interest which any
</p>
<p>rightminded person must feel in the cause of morality and virtue. The above passages,
</p>
<p>the learned counsel contended, were based upon hypotheses or suppositions. The libel pro-
</p>
<p>ceeds. " Your ancestors having scattered dust in the eyes of simple people, made them
</p>
<p>blind." Do you wish to make them see, or taking a false pride in the upholding of your
</p>
<p>religion, do you, (Judoonathjee Maharaj) wish to delude simple people still more ? A
</p>
<p>natural question to one who set himself up to propagate his religion ! " If you wish,
</p>
<p>then, do you personally adopt a virtuous course of conduct ?" Is that libellous ? Why
</p>
<p>the Times newspaper for several days admonished the Prince of Wales to persue the paths
</p>
<p>of virtue and morality, and has he sued Mr. Walter for a libel ? This part of the article
</p>
<p>is but an advice, a recommendation, to the Maharaj to adopt a line of conduct which shall
</p>
<p>distinguish him fmm the rest of his brethren and from the upholders of the doctrines of
</p>
<p>these pestilential books. Why, here is the plainest language as language can be, " Do
</p>
<p>you adopt a virtuous course of conduct, and admonish your other Maharajas." The mean-
</p>
<p>ing of this exhortation cannot be mistaken. There was another inuendo, to which
</p>
<p>great weight was attached in the Demurrer case, and to which Mr. Anstey now
</p>
<p>called the Court's attention, kiz., as to the character of the Maharajas as religious
</p>
<p>preceptors. Tliat inuendo was not proved ; on the contrary, it was disproved by
</p>
<p>plaintitTs own witnesses. There must be a proof of the averment tendered ; but no
</p>
<p>experts had been called, no witnesses had been called to prove the Maharajas to be the
</p>
<p>preceptors of religion. Those who had been called, said they did not know what the doc-
</p>
<p>trines of the Shastras are. One said he had no time for enquiry ; he did not know what
</p>
<p>the Shastras said, and followed the customs and usages of his ancestors. Another said the
</p>
<p>Maharajas gave no instruction ; it is the Gujeratee Brahmins who read and explain the
</p>
<p>Shastras. Another said the Maharajas never taught any thing, nor did they ever preach.

<p>the Maharajas at all. To prove that they are the preceptors of such Hindu religion, it
</p>
<p>ought to be proved that they preach any religion at all. Ko averment was tendered by
</p>
<p>the plaintiff on any one of these material points ; and a nonsuit must be allowed for want
</p>
<p>of a proof to sustain it. Returning from this digression to the libel itself, the learned
</p>
<p>counsel said the next passage must be read as follows :  " You Maharas ! who, acting
</p>
<p>up to that commentary of Goculnathjee, defile the wives and daughters of your devotees, dt-sist
</p>
<p>from that, and destroy at once inmiorality such as that of the company at the Has festival. As
</p>
<p>long as you shall not do so, for so long you cannot give religious admonition and propagate your
</p>
<p>own religious faith. Do you be pleased to be assured of that." Now, what is in this
</p>
<p>passage to connect the plaintiff with it ? There must be something laid by the plaintiff
</p>
<p>before the )ury to shov^r that it is meant as a general aspersion upon his own character
</p>
<p>and that of the other Maharajas. Considering the context, asked Mr. Anstey, is that
</p>
<p>even a libel upon the class ? The meaning of the passage is this, " You (Maharajas)
</p>
<p>have put forward certain books in which adulterers and adultery are praised, and you
</p>
<p>allow your followers to read and believe in those books. Unless, therefore, you
</p>
<p>repudiate these doctrines, the cause of religion will not advance. Do you be assured
</p>
<p>of that !" That's the meaning of the passage, that is what the writer meant to ex-
</p>
<p>press. If the sacred books of the sect are of that kind ; if the defendant, from an early
</p>
<p>period of his life, knew that the books of the sect contained more than permission 
</p>
<p>an injunction  to the crime of adultery, where the adulterers are the Maharajas, then,
</p>
<p>said the learned counsel, it fell within the bounds of legitimate criticism for the de-
</p>
<p>fendant (a member of the sect) to say that these were the doctrines inculcated to the
</p>
<p>followers of his sect. The official translations of the libel, Mr. Anstey proceeded to
</p>
<p>observe differed ; and the meaning of the passage was so given in the plaint as to
</p>
<p>fix the inuendo upon the plaintiff and the other Maharajas. The construction which
</p>
<p>Mr. Flynn, when in the witness-box, put upon the passage was inconsistent with itself
</p>
<p>and with the context
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould,  Mr. Flynn was positive that there was a full-stop before
</p>
<p>the word " Desist."
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey said the passage must be read as he had given it above ; the other
</p>
<p>constructions of it was inconsistent. In no part of the plaint was it averred that the
</p>
<p>plaintiff was charged with adultery. According to the principles of the cases already
</p>
<p>cited, the sensus verb'irum must be, first, clearly ascertained ; the libel must be proved in
</p>
<p>the sense in which plaintiff understood it ; and there must be a distinct averment. Unless
</p>
<p>these objections could be answered, the case was already made out for a nonsuit. All that
</p>
<p>the defendant had said, came within the legitimate range of criticism. Following up hia
</p>
<p>argument, jMr. Anstey asked, who ever heard of an action of a priest against a parson or
</p>
<p>a parson against a priest ? and he submitted there was nothing more in this. It is in
</p>
<p>evidence that the defendant is a member  a protesting member  of the sect ; he wishes to
</p>
<p>remain amicably with its members, but has no desire to remain unreformed and unpurged
</p>
<p>of those abominations, in which some of the members notoriously engage. If there have
</p>
<p>been publications on one side, there have been publications by the other also. These ques-
</p>
<p>tions of adultery, of blasphemous adultery, and sacrilegious pleasure have for some months
</p>
<p>filled the columns of native newspapers, tracts, and magazines, and the plaintifi himself was
</p>
<p>the originator of some of them, and took part in the discussion. Such is the complexion
</p>
<p>of the times, which have come groaning for reform, and the defendant finds himself in the
</p>
<p>capacity of an instructor and a teacher to his less fortunate castemen. He has denounced

</p>
<p>gross abuses. In the deplorable state of things by which he was surrounded, he felt
</p>
<p>himself called upon to write, under the inspiration of his better nature, which has been
</p>
<p>cultivated more or less by the precepts of our own moral philosophy and probably our own
</p>
<p>better faith. The counsel said, the occasion was justifiable, and such as would justify much
</p>
<p>more stronger language than had been used for the reformation of public abuses. To sup-
</p>
<p>port his argument that publications for the exposure of public abuses and for the public
</p>
<p>good, are justifiable, Mr. Anstey cited from Mr. Starkie's book several cases in point, Hugo
</p>
<p>vs. Spanier, Somerville vs. Haipkins, Harris vs Thomson, and others. The same doctrine
</p>
<p>is laid down by Mr. Cooke, and also in the general work on Torts by Mr. Anderson. In
</p>
<p>one of these cases, Baron Parke held that honest communications for the common welfare
</p>
<p>of society must be protected. If 2^rima facie, it is so, it is incumbent on the plaintiff to
</p>
<p>79
</p>
<p>give evidence of malice, in which case the defendant would have to prove the innocence of
</p>
<p>the words used by him. But a mere excess of words is no evidence of malice, as appears
</p>
<p>from the cases of Cooke vs. Wyldes, Taylor vs. Hawkins, &c. Mr. Anstey had now gone
</p>
<p>through all the leading authorities, and had only to remind the Court that the allegations
</p>
<p>of the plaint entirely disproved were the following :-the all -important allegation pointed to
</p>
<p>by the inuendo as the Kali Yug ; the characters of the Maharajas as preceptors of the
</p>
<p>Hindu religion : that the plaintiff is a high priest of a high caste. The learned counsel
</p>
<p>had every reason to rely upon a nonsuit being entered.
</p>
<p>Mr. Dunbar, arguing on the same side as Mr. Anstey, addressed to the Court a few
</p>
<p>arguments on the question whether there was any libel. The passage alluding to the plain-
</p>
<p>tiff was not directed to himself personally, but to the sect of which he is a m.ember, and
</p>
<p>referred to him as one who had come forward to propagate his religion. It calls upon
</p>
<p>plaintiff, and says that if he wishes to propagate and spread religion then he must adopt
</p>
<p>such conduct. It appeared, upon plaintiffs own showing, that this passage was addressed
</p>
<p>not to him, but through him to the whole sect. If it reflected upon him, it did so only
</p>
<p>upon his character as a preceptor of religion, but on this latter point the Court had no
</p>
<p>evidence at all. Unless there was sufficient evidence to show that the libel pointed to
</p>
<p>plaintiff as a preceptor of religion, the Court would be justified in entering a nonsuit. The
</p>
<p>learned counsel referred to the case of Solomon vs. Lawson, remarking that it applied to
</p>
<p>this case. If the plaintiff said the inuendo was pointed to him alone, the whole case falls,
</p>
<p>because there is no personal imputation upon plaintiff in the libel, (Cites and comments
</p>
<p>upon Smith vs. Kelly, 3rd Campbell, 460.) The only case against the arguments for a
</p>
<p>nonsuit was May vs. Brown, which, however, was not generally cited, and did not affect
</p>
<p>this case in reality. The plaintiff could not recover any damages unless he showed how
</p>
<p>the libel affected him personally, and how as a preceptor of religion. There was no evidence
</p>
<p>whatsoever to support any of the averments, while the statement of and concerning the
</p>
<p>plaintiff must be taken as affecting his professional character. On these grounds, and others
</p>
<p>which Mr. Anstey had so ably and fully argued, the Court must nonsuit the plaintiff
</p>
<p>REPLY.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley, in reply, stated he would notice one or two points, and if the Court
</p>
<p>decided in favour of either of them, there would be no necessity for him to go further. It
</p>
<p>had been said by both the learned counsel on the other side that I\[ay vs. Broicn was not
</p>
<p>recognised as an authority, but he would say his researches had been more fortunate, and
</p>
<p>it appeared that the case was often cited by Baron Parke and others. Several of the cases

</p>
<p>which were cited by the learned counsel were decided previous to the modern system of
</p>
<p>pleading, and this system was adopted here by the 166th Common Law rule of 1844.
</p>
<p>That rule is applicable to this country and the members of the Bombay Bar were under
</p>
<p>no necessity to resort to the pleadings of ancient times. (Calls attention to a para, in the
</p>
<p>pleadings of the time of William IV. as to actions on the case.) The plaintift' was only
</p>
<p>here to prove the issue between the parties and what was not expressly traversed. The
</p>
<p>learned counsel cited Drummond vs. Pigot (2 Bingham,) in which the action was brought
</p>
<p>for an unfounded and malicious claim of debt. Now, the learned counsel's proposition
</p>
<p>according to the decision in this case was, that all introductory averments, not traversed,
</p>
<p>are admitted on the record. It had been held by the learned Chief Justice in this very
</p>
<p>ease, that the introductory avermonts are not material and are admitted generally. They
</p>
<p>80
</p>
<p>are necessarily admitted in the plea of not guilty put in by the defendants in this case ;
</p>
<p>and in this view Mr. Bayley said he was fortified by the judgment given by the Chief
</p>
<p>Justice in the Demurrer case on the ISth July last. (The learned counsel cited Wafkins
</p>
<p>vs. Lea and another case from Meason and Wellesley's reports.) Let us ask the question,
</p>
<p>said Mr. Bavley, who are the Judges or what is a libel and what is not ? The Court,
</p>
<p>as jurors, were constitutional Judges of facts. The sum and substance of all the arguments
</p>
<p>addressed to the Court for a nonsuit was, Is there a case to go to the jury ? Their Lord-
</p>
<p>ships had to define the libel, and say whether it was a case to go to a jury or not. The
</p>
<p>Court must not be asked to say what must come out at the close, and these lengthy
</p>
<p>arguments of the learned counsel might well have been reserved for a motion in arrest of
</p>
<p>judgment. Coming to the inuendoes, Mr. Bayley said an inuendo is only explanatory of
</p>
<p>some matter ; Tt cannot add to, or enlarge upon, what has been stated ; it cannot extend
</p>
<p>the sense, and is an explanation of what is said before. There was no inconsistency in
</p>
<p>any one of the inuendoes in this case ; in the first part of the libel, the plaintiff and his
</p>
<p>sect are distinctly pointed at, and the inuendo applies to him as well as to his sectaries.
</p>
<p>The closing part of the article distinctly points to the plaintiff and other Maharajas : 
</p>
<p>" Then do you personally adopt a virtuous course of conduct, and admonish your other
</p>
<p>Maharajas." Jt was said the other day that this was the only inuendo that was correct ;
</p>
<p>and now, to-day, it is argued that it does not apply to plaintiff ! The witness Jumnadass
</p>
<p>stated he took the latter part of the libel to refer to Judunathjee only, and that there was
</p>
<p>no other person of that name. This witness was not contradicted nor cross-examined upon
</p>
<p>the point ; and Mr. Bayley had every right to suppose it was taken for granted by the
</p>
<p>defendant's counsel. The Court, Mr. Bayley believed, had no doubt whatever that in this
</p>
<p>inuendo the plaintiff was referred to. The only witness who knew English, Vurjeevundass
</p>
<p>Madhowdas, said the plaintiff was a high priest and was respected by the Brahmins. The
</p>
<p>learned counsel might, therefore, take it as admitted that the plaintiff is a Maharaj at all
</p>
<p>events. There were very few inuei does in this plaint and the first occurred in the very
</p>
<p>first line of the libel  " In the Purans and other Shastras of the Hindus." Was it
</p>
<p>necessary, Mr. Bayley asked, to set out everything, even the facts settled and admitted ?
</p>
<p>An inuendo cannot be used without previous averment ; and the subsequent allusion to the
</p>
<p>Purans and Shastras, being preceded by the very same words in the introductory averment
</p>
<p>(where they are taken as admitted,) it was not at all necessary to explain it a second
</p>
<p>time. The learned counsel would repeat that the introductory averments were immaterial
</p>
<p>and could not be traversed, and that there was not a single inuendo which was not more

</p>
<p>than explained in the averment. After referring again to the judgment of Sir M. E.
</p>
<p>Sausse in the Demurrer case, Mr. Bayley said, the plaintiff had given proof by the
</p>
<p>evidence of his followers and others who have been on pilgrimages to different cities of India,
</p>
<p>that the Maharajs are respected in Bombay and elsewhere by the Bhattias, Lohanas,
</p>
<p>and Banias as their high priests. The second plea is that the plaintiff is not a preceptor
</p>
<p>of religion, while it h d been sworn that he and other Maharajs are the preceptors of
</p>
<p>religion. There was satisfactory evidence on both these issues ; and the simple question
</p>
<p>now was  Is there evidence to send the case to a jury ? The first four pleas, Mr.
</p>
<p>Bayley went on to say, as to which the burden of proof lay upon the plaintiff, were
</p>
<p>all proved. The learned counsel was quite ready to proceed to a consideration ot the
</p>
<p>authorities cited and the arguments addressed to the Court ujion the other [ileas, but
</p>
<p>the question was now extremely narrowed, and it only remained for the learned Judges
</p>
<p>to say, if there was a sufficient evidence to submit the case to a jury as a libel.
</p>
<p>81
</p>
<p>M. Bayley.  It' it is no libel in youi* Lordship's opinion, I shan't proceed.
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould.  As lar I am concerned, I should like to hear your further
</p>
<p>observations.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley now proceeded to a consideration of the authorities cited by the learned
</p>
<p>counsel on the other side. (Heads Addison on Slander, under the head Wrongs ) The
</p>
<p>learned counsel said the libel had been dissected word by word ; but this was not the
</p>
<p>right way of judging of it : it must be taken in its entirety, and then the reader is
</p>
<p>to say what is the impression produced upon his mind by a perusal of the whole article.
</p>
<p>In ninety-nine out of every hundred cases of murder, the decision is arrived at by
</p>
<p>circumstantial evidence, when the minutest parts are gathered up and meet in a whole,
</p>
<p>and it is then that the offence is established. Now as to the article in this suit, the
</p>
<p>first portion was a historical summary, which is introduced by way of prelude to the
</p>
<p>charges. It shortly ceases to be historical, and comes to the doctrines, of the sect,
</p>
<p>where it is gradually becoming offensive ! " Bo you personally adopt a virtuous course
</p>
<p>of conduct, '^' implying that plaintiff is following any thing but a virtuous course.
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould.  There is no inuendo that he is not.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley.  After the argument and explanations submitted to the Court, arc
</p>
<p>your Lordships prepared to say it is not a libel ? When the plaintiff is singled out,
</p>
<p>and told to adopt a virtuous course ot life and to exhort the other Maharajs who are
</p>
<p>said to be immersed in a sea of licentiousness ;  when these circumstances are taken in
</p>
<p>connection with the general aspersions and imputations upon the whole sect of the Val-
</p>
<p>labhacharyas ; and then winding up with the personal attack upon the plaintiff, I very
</p>
<p>much doubt if your Lordships will say it is not a libel. " You Maharajs defile the
</p>
<p>wives and daughters of your devotees ;" Is not this libellous ?
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould thought that the words ot Goculnathjee's Commentary were
</p>
<p>necessary in considering the doctrines of a sacred book.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley said their was no proof that such a person existed, or ever wrote the
</p>
<p>Commentary ! The question was what impression the article would produce upon the.
</p>
<p>minds of Hindu readers, and not the mind of a European.
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould.  We are not to import European notions into the consideration
</p>
<p>of a question of this kind. But how are we to arrive at " libel or no libel,"  that's
</p>
<p>the difficulty which at present presses upon my mind.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley.  The way is to consider ourselves out of Court, and then judge what
</p>
<p>impression must have been produced upon the minds of the readers of the original article

<p>in 1860.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley said he had not finished, and the Court therefore rose at a quarter-past 5 P. sr..
</p>
<p>Sir M. R. Sausse.  Since yesterday Brother Arnould has looked into the pleadings,
</p>
<p>and is of opiiiion tliat there is a case to go to a jury as to libel or no libel. I have already
</p>
<p>expressed my opinion that the first part of the article is historical but it is a very different
</p>
<p>matter indeed when wc come to the latter port alluding to Judunathjee personally.

<p>Mr. Bayley llierefore proceeded witli his reply to the apphcatlon for a nonsuit, and
</p>
<p>concluded at half-past 2 r. M. Mr. Scoble followed on t!ie same side and linished his
</p>
<p>address at a quarter before 4 P. M. Mr. Anstey then made his reply till 6 r. iM. when
</p>
<p>the Court closed.
</p>
<p>F]fih I)a>i, Frldaij, Zlst January, 1862.
</p>
<p>REPLY CONTINUED.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bay ley resumed his reply this morning ; he said that much stress had been
</p>
<p>placed by the learned counsel for the defence on the question of libel or no libel, and the
</p>
<p>case of Hern m. Stowel had been constantly referred to. The Court there held that it was
</p>
<p>not actionable ; inasmuch as it was not a libel upon the plaintiff in his individual character.
</p>
<p>In this case it is said that this is not a libel upon the plaintiff in his individual character,
</p>
<p>but in that of Maharaj and Brahmin. (The learned counsel here cited several cases.) The
</p>
<p>Court was bound to regard the plea of justification, and even if the Court thought that
</p>
<p>this was not a libel, it could not from the averments come to any other conclusion, even
</p>
<p>if the whole of the other arguments were disposed of, this was clearly a libel upon the
</p>
<p>plaintiff in his character. The defendant charges the plaintiff with defiling the wives and
</p>
<p>daughters of his followers. (Here the learned counsel commented at great length on the
</p>
<p>authorities cited by Mr. Anstey, and remarked.) On looking at the libel which we must
</p>
<p>now prove by evidence, your Lordships will see that the commentary stands in bold relief
</p>
<p> it has not been stated that Goculnathjee made it, or that he wrote it. It may be quite
</p>
<p>consistent that the commentary was not written. We must not look at the libel itself, but
</p>
<p>at the plaint. Amongst the introductory averments are those relating to the plaintiff, and
</p>
<p>he would call the attention of the Court to the translation of the article and to the other
</p>
<p>pleadings. The libel is upon him in his double capacity as man and as Maharaj. The
</p>
<p>case of Hern vs. Stoicell does not apply  the case of Roberts vs. MacDougall (4th Bingham)
</p>
<p>to which he alluded shows that the action of libel can be maintained ; the p'aintiff could
</p>
<p>abandon one of the capacities, and sue upon the other. It is stated that the alleged
</p>
<p>inuendoes are not proved with reference to what the Shastras are, and what the Kali Yug
</p>
<p>is : he would say that it was not necessary : also that the Court has not been invited to
</p>
<p>look into the Pooranas. The Court has been told that this sect is not 400 years old : this
</p>
<p>he would submit had nothing to do with the libel. Protestantism is not so old : and the
</p>
<p>doctrine of the Immaculate Conception in which the Roman Catholics believed is of a very
</p>
<p>recent date. It is also alleged that the plaintiff must show special damage, this is not
</p>
<p>necessary (here the learned counsel cited cases to bear out his view.) The next allegation

</p>
<p>is, the letters were written as a privileged communication ; that he is not damnified in his
</p>
<p>sacerdotal character ; he had said that the plaintiff is injured in his private character, and
</p>
<p>this was quite sufficient to constitute a libel. If your Lordships are of opinion that
</p>
<p>it is a libel, then malice is implied. It is stated that it was a reflection upon the class
</p>
<p>and not upon the plaintiff. Great deal of argument has been brought forward to show
</p>
<p>that the plaintiff is not singled out personally : but what would the learned counsel for the
</p>
<p>defence say to the passage, " Do you personally practise a virtuous life and admonish,
</p>
<p>83
</p>
<p>&c." It has also been attempted to be shown that the Maharajs were not the preceptors
</p>
<p>of religion  the Court has had no evidence to show that they were not, whereas one of the
</p>
<p>witnesses distinctly told the Court that they did instruct the sect : the Court has had no
</p>
<p>evidence to show that there were any other preceptoi's. If the Court, was, however, not of
</p>
<p>this opinion, he would submit that there was an issue, and a case to go to a jury. It has
</p>
<p>also been contended that there is a variance between the translation and the oral evidence
</p>
<p>of Mr. Flynn : this was immaterial : he would submit that in the Gujarati cha-
</p>
<p>racter the libel stands. The Court has full power under the rules to correct any
</p>
<p>translation, and he trusted that language so ambiguous would not prevent the Court
</p>
<p>from letting the case proceed. The next is, this is a privileged communication, (Mr.
</p>
<p>Bay ley here read from Star tie on Slander and cited cases.) He said that not a
</p>
<p>case had been cited by the learned counsel on the part of the defence to show that-
</p>
<p>every publication in a newspaper is a privileged communication. Justifiable occasion
</p>
<p>would give a writing the character of a privileged communication : as in the instance
</p>
<p>of a master giving a certificate to his servant. He contended that the privileges ap-
</p>
<p>plied to certain cases only, and that any abuse of a people, of a class, or of any
</p>
<p>member of a class would not prevent the party abused from being entitled to protec-
</p>
<p>tion. Your Lordships could not, Mr. Bayley said, think for a moment that this is a
</p>
<p>privileged communication, but if your Lordships are of opinion that it is, then he
</p>
<p>would submit that there was malice in the publication to rebut the evidence. He
</p>
<p>would submit for the reasons stated, that the application for nonsuit must fail ; a
</p>
<p>prima facie had been made out and that the case should go to a jury.
</p>
<p>Mr. Scoble said that he appeared with his learned friend, Mr. Bayley, for the
</p>
<p>plaintiff. He would endeavour to make his observations as brief as possible, regretting
</p>
<p>that he would have to do so. .Thirst then, he would remark that the ground upon
</p>
<p>which the application for a nonsuit has been made is not one which can be deter-
</p>
<p>mined by the Court : his learned friend asks the Court to nonsuit the plaintiff, to-
</p>
<p>tally disregarding the plea of justification. He would venture to say that this was an
</p>
<p>unprecedented application. Had their Lordships been sitting as jurors, he should have
</p>
<p>asked them to take into their consideration two of the eight pleas, but his learned
</p>
<p>friend had unfairly taken advantage of the double position. The seventh and eighth pleas are
</p>
<p>pleas of justification, and his learned friend cannot now ' be allowed after having put
</p>
<p>the pleas on record to ask the Court to leave them out of all consideration. (Referred
</p>
<p>to text books, and said 'it was clearly supported Ly Chitty) Nearly all the evidence

</p>
<p>cross-examination. The plaintiff's case had been framed on the pleas drawn up by
</p>
<p>the defendants, and he would say it was not proper that he should be now turned
</p>
<p>round upon. Much had been said on the introductory averments, as to the plaintiff being
</p>
<p>Maharaj. (He referred to the case of Jones vs. Stephen, an action in a case for libel,
</p>
<p>in which rules for pleading in an action of slander are laid down.) If the defendant
</p>
<p>wanted, Mr. Scoble went on to say, to reply on the defence now raised, proving the
</p>
<p>general issue, he ought to have struck on the two pleas of justification. Mr. Scoble referred
</p>
<p>to one or two cases on privileged communication, and said that those cases establish that
</p>
<p>communication published in a newspaper must be proved to be true. The case had been
</p>
<p>put forward unfairly. The defendant is represented as a Reformer, a Martin Luther of
</p>
<p>the Banian taste. This he would say was not a religious question at all ; the question is.
</p>
<p>84
</p>
<p>kas the plaintiff been libelled ? Here we have a man, who up to the publication of th
</p>
<p>libel, was held in respect and esteem, and has borne an unblemished character up to the
</p>
<p>time of bringing this action. He has brought an action on the Plea side of this Court, he
</p>
<p>might have done it on the Crown side, but his object is to show to the world that he has
</p>
<p>given the defendant an opportunity of proving the statements made by him, reflecting on
</p>
<p>his (the plaintiff's) character. His learned friend, Mr. Anstey, had said that no evidence
</p>
<p>was brought forward to show what the Shastras and the Kali Yug are, he would say that
</p>
<p>their Lordships were supposed to know the religious laws and customs of the natives, and
</p>
<p>that by the charter their Lordships were bound to make such rules as would not inter-
</p>
<p>fere with the customs, religion, laws, and usages of the natives : and he had a right to
</p>
<p>assume that their Lordships knew something of the facts and religion of the natives ; he
</p>
<p>should say that it was unnecessary for the plaintiff to call experts to show what the religion
</p>
<p>of the Shastras is. Here Mr. Scoble went on to say, we have a clergyman of the sect of
</p>
<p>Vallabacharyas, a sect in existence since 400 years ago. The defendant is a person who
</p>
<p>dissents. The Maharaj is in the position of a clergyman of the established church of Eng-
</p>
<p>land or of the Romish church ; in fact, more, he is a r/ooroo or spiritual guide of the Hindu
</p>
<p>religion, which the Court is bound to regard according to the charter. Public life is sub-
</p>
<p>ject to criticism, but when one comes to a private home and draws up the curtain and
</p>
<p>exposes private life, so that it is detrimental and injurious to the interests, surely, he would
</p>
<p>say, there could not be any thing to make the act a justifiable one. Here their Lordships
</p>
<p>are told, the Maharaj is a public man, and that he under the guise of religion defiles the
</p>
<p>tender wives and daughters of his followers : he could say that public comment on any
</p>
<p>characters cannot justify it, unless it can be proved to be true. In the case of Levt/
</p>
<p>va. (4th Bingham) the plaintiff was charged with publishing a facetious poem of
</p>
<p>eight verses, whereby the defendant was held up to scorn and ridicule. The bailiff
</p>
<p>(defendant) was called a bum, no doubt it was amusing ; but C. J. Best, who decided
</p>
<p>the case, was of opinion that it was a" libel, inasmuch as the publication was hurtful to
</p>
<p>the feelings and calculated to make him appear mean in the eyes of the people. There is
</p>
<p>no doubt, Mr. Scoble contended, that the plaintiff is charged with a high and grave ofience
</p>
<p>in the Hindu religion : if that offence is allowed to be imputed to him it must make
</p>
<p>him little in the yes of the European community ; then the damage appears on the face
</p>
<p>of the record and is a libel. Now as to the question of malice as to the presumption of
</p>
<p>malice, he would refer their Lordships to the case of Simpson vs. Wallace, 12 Q. B.
</p>
<p>He would contend that there was no occasion to justify the libel : it was not within the

</p>
<p>range of a privileged communication. As the case stands the plaintiff bears an unblemished
</p>
<p>character, and is held in respect by the Hindus : and as to the point raised by his
</p>
<p>learned friend, Mr. Anstey, that the libel was incomprehensible, he would maintain that
</p>
<p>it was not so. The Court had before it only one version  the translation by Mr. Flynn,
</p>
<p>the chief official translator : for aught he knew another translation may be in his learned
</p>
<p>friend's pocket. Two points had resulted strongly from Mr. Flynn 's examination. The
</p>
<p>word " defile" was not in the past tense  the sentence was not in two parts but one,
</p>
<p>and there was no full stop. A great deal had also been said that the word " Maharaj"
</p>
<p>in that sentence was in the vocative case : and that since his learned friend had been allowed
</p>
<p>to make a suggestion he would make one also. No grammar would justify the word Maharaj
</p>
<p>being used in the vocative case. It was nothing more than an apostrophe. He would
</p>
<p>with these remarks submit that the application of his learned friend be refused, and the
</p>
<p>defendant called upon to answer.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey rose and commented at great length on the cases cited by Mr. Bayley
</p>
<p>and Scoble ; he said that the case of Roberts vs. McDouf/all referred to by Mr. IBayley
</p>
<p>was no authority for the plaintiff ; he produced other cases and read passages from the
</p>
<p>Weeklt/ Reporter and text-books, and submitted that there was no case made out to go
</p>
<p>to a jury, that their Lordships were not then to consider whether there was a libel or no
</p>
<p>libel, but as to whether the plaintiff had made out such a case as should go to a jury.
</p>
<p>Averments the Court had, but proof it had none. The learned counsel commented on the
</p>
<p>different points of Mr. Bayley 's arguments ; he laid before their Lordships the law on the
</p>
<p>question of libel, and privileged communication, and said that it would spare their Lord-
</p>
<p>ships much time and trouble and the parties expense, if instead of entering upon the
</p>
<p>defence which must occupy at least twelve weeks (I), they would declare that the defendants
</p>
<p>were entitled to a nonsuit.
</p>
<p>The Court rose at C o'clock and said that the decision would be delivered the next
</p>
<p>dav.
</p>
<p>Sixth Bail, Saturdaij, \1 Februari/, 18G2.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice this day pronounced the Court's decision on the application for &
</p>
<p>nonsuit, which was refused, and the defence was ordered to be proceeded with. The
</p>
<p>power of the Court to entertain the motion, said his Lordship, has been contested, but the
</p>
<p>Court was of opinion that it had that power. It would be an unseemly thing to stop the
</p>
<p>proceedings however, except in the presence of a very clear case for it. It appeared that
</p>
<p>this application was made upon a two-fold ground, viz. that the plaintiff" has sued in a
</p>
<p>particular character, and the character must be proved ; and it was argued that as lie has
</p>
<p>tailed to prove the character, the case must fall ; and that even if the proof of character
</p>
<p>were sustained, and the Court came to that opinion, yet that the publication was not
</p>
<p>libellous. His Lordship was of opinion that the averments in the plaint, which were
</p>
<p>not traversed, must be taken to be admitted. Having looked at the evidence adduced
</p>
<p>for the plaintiff, the Court thought there was some evidence of a libel. The case of
</p>
<p>May vs. Broicn and Lewis vs. Walter are not expressly overruled, and the Court
</p>
<p>would act upon them as good law, while, according to the principles of these cases,
</p>
<p>the plaintiff' had established the characters in which he alleged he was libelled. Then
</p>
<p>came the legal question, there is a case to send to a jury on the question of a libel.
</p>
<p>His Lordship considered, after the very able and erudite discussion of counsel on either
</p>
<p>side, that, as to the libel, there was a prima facie case disclosed on the face of the
</p>
<p>publication : and it was his opinion that the tendency of the latter part of the article
</p>
<p>is to bring the plaintiff into hatred, and to injure his character. That being the opi-

</p>
<p>nion of the Court, it remained with the defendants to proceed with the case, and to discharge
</p>
<p>themselves, by proving the libel to be justifiable, or by disproving any of the allega-
</p>
<p>tions which were traversed by their pleadings. His Lordship thought the mere cross-
</p>
<p>examination of the plaintiff^s witnesses made out nothing to show that the libel was
</p>
<p>entirely justifiable. It was said the evidence for the defendant was very considerable
</p>
<p>SG
</p>
<p>and possibly it was very lengthy, but every endeavour, said his Lordship, will, he
</p>
<p>was sure, be made on all occasions to economize public time. Having expressed hia
</p>
<p>opinion that the gist of the libel consisted in the personal charge against the plantiff, hia
</p>
<p>Lordship would hope that the evidence which might be brought forward would have its
</p>
<p>bearing upon that particular issue, whether as to the fact of a justifiable occasion or as
</p>
<p>to a justification of the libel itself. The Court thought that the strictures on Gocalnathji'a
</p>
<p>commentary in the earlier part of the libel, although they contained strong expressions,
</p>
<p>did not appear to go beyond the range of legitimate criticism.
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould entirely concurred in the views of the learned Chief Justice.
</p>
<p>He would confine his remarks only to two points,  whether the oft-cited case of Home
</p>
<p>vs. Sloicell conflicted with May vs. Brown, that is, whether the libel must be shown to
</p>
<p>have affected the plaintiff in both characters. His Lordship considered that the decisions
</p>
<p>in those cases did not conflict with each other in any respect. With regard to the
</p>
<p>other important question, whether it was a justifiable occasion for the publication of
</p>
<p>the libel, his Lordship said he threw out observations during the hearing to guard
</p>
<p>against any thing being surmised against the free, open, and unreserved discussion of
</p>
<p>public questions by a public writer. An article is not libellous because it is free, open,
</p>
<p>and bold in the exposure of measures and men, nor because it transcends the bounds
</p>
<p>of polite journalism. The strictures on the commentary of Gocalnathji, it appeared to
</p>
<p>his Lordship, were not libellous, because the defendant in his capacity of a public
</p>
<p>writer, gives vent to a strong, honest, and virtuous indignation against the upholders of
</p>
<p>what he considers to be the atrocious doctrines of the commentary. All this was no
</p>
<p>libel, but honest, bold, and justifiable comments. But then comes the quesion,  is he
</p>
<p>justified in singling out the plaintiff and attacking his personal character ? As very
</p>
<p>properly observed in the able address of Mr. Scoble, the obvious tendency of the
</p>
<p>expressions used must be kept in view, in deciding a question like this. The enquiry
</p>
<p>naturally occurs to the mind, what must have been the impression produced by a
</p>
<p>perusal of the article upon the minds, not of a certain class, but of readers who are
</p>
<p>by no means remarkable for acumen or judgment ?  " You INIaharajs ! acting up
</p>
<p>to that commentary, defile the wives and daughters of your devotees." Here is that
</p>
<p>which constitutes the libel ; and the question arises. Did or did not the defendant
</p>
<p>intend to say that the plaintiff, and other Maharajs, defile the wives and daughters
</p>
<p>of their devotees ? To his Lordship there appeared to be some proof necessary of a
</p>
<p>justifiable occasion for this direct, personal imputation upon the plaintiff". Sir Joseph

<p>concurred with the Chief Justice in thinking, that the justification ought to be addressed
</p>
<p>to this point only, and it would be a waste of public time to justify any remarks
</p>
<p>which preceded those just referred to.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey here asked that leave may be reserved to the defendant to show cause
</p>
<p>against the decision on the application for a nonsuit.
</p>
<p>After some discussion, the Court reserved liberty to the defendant to move, after
</p>
<p>verdict, to enter a judgment on the nonsuit, but no fresh arguments were to be
</p>
<p>addressed to the Court by the defendant in that respect, unless called, upon to do so,
</p>
<p>by the Court,
</p>
<p>87
</p>
<p>SPEECH FOR THE DEFENCE.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey, on the sitting of the Court after tiiTin, commenced a very able speech
</p>
<p>for the defence. It became now his duty (said the learned counsel) to address to the
</p>
<p>Court such observations upon the facts of the case as might prepare their Lordships
</p>
<p>for the evidence which would be adduced on behalf of the defendants. If for the
</p>
<p>purpose of proof the inuendo, whereby the alleged libel has been interpreted into a direct
</p>
<p>attack upon the plaintiff, had failed ; or if it could be proved that it was nothing
</p>
<p>more than the bare enunciation of true criticisms on the doctrines of the commentary ;
</p>
<p>or if it couid be shown to have been used merely for the purpose of giving support
</p>
<p>to the view taken by defendant of the commentary, then Mr. Anstey hoped that any
</p>
<p>one of these circumstances would exonerate, in the opinion of the Court, the defendants
</p>
<p>of all misconduct, more especially with regard to the concluding words of the paragraph.
</p>
<p>The history of this case is a history of the justifying occasion on which the defendant
</p>
<p>relies. It is proved that the defendant is a member of the Bania caste ; that the
</p>
<p>caste as a body is divided as nearly as possible between the worshippers of the
</p>
<p>IMaharaj and the worshippers of Shiva ; and that the latter are naturally antagonistic
</p>
<p>to the former. That in addition to the Bania caste, another caste called the Bhattias,
</p>
<p>the most ignorant and the most inveterate in superstition, are to a man worshippers of
</p>
<p>the Maharaj, and believe in him as the incarnation of the deity, sent on a mission of
</p>
<p>impurity from the other world. Some of them believe that, in virtue of his divine
</p>
<p>authority, his power over the doctrines and all subjects pertaining to religion, is omni-
</p>
<p>potent ; in short, to use the language of one of the plaintiff"s witneses, the people's credence
</p>
<p>in a doctrine, however atrocious, depends upon its being contained in a sacred book.
</p>
<p>It then overrules the authority of all previous cases, and the Bhattias believe in it
</p>
<p>with a blind zeal. The Bhattia is the only community in which the Maharaj can
</p>
<p>boast of commanding an unanimous following. In any other caste, the number of his
</p>
<p>devotees is comparatively very much smaller. And yet he is forsooth addressed by all
</p>
<p>as the " Maha Prabhu" (great God) or " Maharaj," great king, is worshipped with
</p>
<p>divine honours, is swung in the swing in the same manner as the sacred idol, is
</p>
<p>bathed with saflfron water as the image is, and is honoured with prostrations as the
</p>
<p>image is honoured ! Less indifferent to public opinion than the Bhattias are, the Bauias
</p>
<p>are less blind in their zeal. To these are to be added a wretchedly small sect of
</p>
<p>i\Iarwarris, a few Bhansalees, and a handful of outcaste Brahmins, to make up the
</p>
<p>catalogue of the IMaharajs' worshippers.

</p>
<p>This is the sort of evidence, Mr. Anstey said, offered in support of the plaintiffs
</p>
<p>case. In a country swarming with a numerous population, some two hundred millions
</p>
<p>of persons professing the ancient religion of the land, the Maharajs, the Court is
</p>
<p>seriously asked to believe, are the preceptors of the ancient Hindu religion and the spiritual
</p>
<p>guides of the people ! Mr. Anstey laid some stress on this point, because, even if the
</p>
<p>question of damage sustained by plaintiff from the^publication of the libel be taken into
</p>
<p>consideration, he would most strongly urge that the prefatory averments are not proved.
</p>
<p>Neither the presence of malice nor any inuendo whatsoever, can compensate for the
</p>
<p>want of proof of those averments. The learned counsel here cited several cases to show
</p>
<p>that this has been ruled over and over again. Even if the plaintiff were damaged by
</p>
<p>the libel, there is no evidence of it, while there is no averment of a special or
</p>
<p>88
</p>
<p>ordinary damage. The witnesses for the defence will tell the Court that plaintiff is in
</p>
<p>no way damaged by the supposed libel, that he is not a Brahmin, that he is an
</p>
<p>outcaste, that his ancestors were outcasted by the Telinga Brahmins for heresy and
</p>
<p>schism, and that he is execrated generally in his character of a Maharaj. It will be
</p>
<p>in evidence that these ]\Iaharajs cannot intermarry out of their body without procuring
</p>
<p>the ex-communication of the wife and her family ; and as the outcasted of the Telinga Brahmins,
</p>
<p>they cannot get a wife without making large promises of money, proportionate to the loss
</p>
<p>of caste and other advantages incurred by some indigent family. Long before the
</p>
<p>libel was written, the plaintiff had but a bad reputation among his own people ; and
</p>
<p>the circumstances under which he suffered in that reputation, will be brought to the
</p>
<p>notice of the Court. Previously, also, to the period of the publication, he refused to
</p>
<p>give instruction except to those who went in search of it to his house. As to the
</p>
<p>female devotees, they were enticed to his rooms under the pretence of religious
</p>
<p>instruction ; and the opportunities thus afforded him were misused for the purpose of
</p>
<p>seduction and adultery.
</p>
<p>The evidence will show that, at this juncture, the plaintiff became acquainted with
</p>
<p>defendant, himself a Vallabacharya, and that the acquaintance was kept up for some
</p>
<p>time. The secretary of the Maharaj communicated with defendant on the subject of
</p>
<p>reform, and other subjects in which the plaintiff pretended to take an interest, though
</p>
<p>his professions were miserably belied by his subsequent conduct. The plaintiff made
</p>
<p>an outward show of taking great interest in the promotion of female education and in
</p>
<p>the reformation of religion ; often exppressed a sanctimonious horror at the adulterous
</p>
<p>practices of his brother Maharajs, and said that he was aware of their adulteries,
</p>
<p>but that the crime was so widely prevalent that it could not be prevented. Their
</p>
<p>seducers were the '* Yarkats," the hereditary procurers of women for the Maharajs.
</p>
<p>It would be shown, said the learned counsel, that as far as the immoral practices of
</p>
<p>the Maharajs are concerned, the plaintiff was the first to deplore their condition. It
</p>
<p>would be shown that, in connection with this libel, a meeting of the Maharaj s followers
</p>
<p>was held under the superintendence of his agents and secretaries to effect a " bundo-
</p>
<p>bust ;" and that those who put their signatures thereto, agreed to do one of two things,
</p>
<p>either not to appear in the Court as witnesses, or to swear falsely that the Maharaj
</p>
<p>never committed adultery. And although the Maharaj's agent, who was also conducting
</p>
<p>this case, should deny the making of any such " bundobust" as that imputed by a
</p>
<p>witness for the plaintiff who swore that it was the same as had been enquired into

</p>
<p>in the case of the Queen vs. Gocukkiss Leiadhur, the learned counsel would prefer to
</p>
<p>believe the other. He would show what that bundobust was, and that it had been punished
</p>
<p>as an attempt to defeat the administration of justice in Her Majesty's Supreme Court. The
</p>
<p>veil of hypocrisy under which plaintiff affected to feel a great interest in female education and the
</p>
<p>re-marriage of Hindu widows, was rather prematurely torn asunder. A more zealous, but bss
</p>
<p>discreet friend of the defendant invited the Maharaj, through the columns of a newspaper, to come
</p>
<p>forvvaid as the advocate of these very desirable innovations. The defendant thought that the
</p>
<p>Maharaj would not so soon declare himself in his true colors ; but he (plaintiff)
</p>
<p>instantly renounced his doctrines concerning the subjects in question, and repudiated
</p>
<p>the opnions imputed to him. He at once quarrelled with the defendant and threw out
</p>
<p>in print reflections of a provocatory character against him. The learned counsel alluded
</p>
<p>to these circumstances to show the position in which the parties stood at the time. This
</p>
<p>89
</p>
<p>was in the month of July 1860. Plaintiff threw out those provocatory reflections in a
</p>
<p>paper over which he has direct or indirect influence. (The learned counsel here cited
</p>
<p>Watts vs. Fraser, and other cases in respect to reflections of a provocatory character.)
</p>
<p>It would be shown that the plaintiff went further ; and in a pamphlet, a serial book
</p>
<p>in fact, publicly challenged the defendant to a controversy on the subject of religion,
</p>
<p>and also ridiculed the defendant's views and opinions therein. A letter signed by
</p>
<p>plaintiff's secretary, and purporting to be written under the plaintiff's authority, was
</p>
<p>inserted in the Chahook newspaper of the 29th September 1860, whereby, also, defendant
</p>
<p>was invited to the controversy. It would be shown, the learned counsel went on to
</p>
<p>observe, that the plaintiff communicated with defendant's paper through his secretary,
</p>
<p>and with other papers through other secretaries and agents. Mr. Anstey here adverted
</p>
<p>to a handbill, published and circulated by plaintiff on his arrival from Surat, in which
</p>
<p>he complained of the Vyshnovs not visiting him as they ought to have done. It would
</p>
<p>be shown that about the end of August 1860, the plaintiff convened a public meeting
</p>
<p>to discuss the subject of widow re-marriage with a Guzeratee poet of the name of Nar-
</p>
<p>madashunker. This was after the challenge published by the indiscreet champion of
</p>
<p>re-marriage. The defendant agitated the subject, and the plaintiff joined in the discussion,
</p>
<p>but was unable to answer his arguments or resist the logical conclusions to which they
</p>
<p>led. Baffled thus in a controversy in which he voluntarily took a share, and apparently
</p>
<p>chagrined by his bad success in the matter, plaintiff started a pamphlet called the
</p>
<p>" Propagator of our own Religion," alluded to in the libel, and with the view of
</p>
<p>securing subscribers, issued hand-bills to be distributed among the Vyshnovs. At the
</p>
<p>end of the first month after the periodical was started, a lecture by the plaintiff was
</p>
<p>pubhshed therein, and a distinct allusion is made to the defendant in the same : 
</p>
<p>" Whoever may wish to write upon this lecture should do so (a direct challenge to
</p>
<p>defendant) by quoting the Shastras, but he who would not do so, should be unworthy
</p>
<p>of belief by his own people." Here, therefore, Mr. Anstey remarked, the defendant is
</p>
<p>denounced in the very first number of plaintiffs periodical, as being unworthy of belief
</p>
<p>by his own people, his castemen. Accepting this direct challenge, and from a conscious-
</p>
<p>ness of his responsibilities, the defendant reviewed in his paper the lecture in question.
</p>
<p>Upon this the plaintiff resorted to aggressive measures, prohibited the Vyshnovs from
</p>
<p>subscribing to defendant's newspaper, and gave expression to his cordial wish that the
</p>
<p>defendant should be punished by excommunication from his caste for writing those reviews
</p>
<p>of the lecture. The article containing the alleged libel, Mr. Anstey therefore maintained,

</p>
<p>was written in answer to the challenge to which the learned counsel had alluded before.
</p>
<p>The defendant wrote another article in vindication of himself, and in reply to the charges
</p>
<p>levelled against him by plaintiff. The controversy was continued for sometime afterwards.
</p>
<p>Amongst others the plaintiff published articles distinctly referring to the defendant as tha
</p>
<p>editor of the Satya Prakash, and accusing him of assigning false meaning to the
</p>
<p>doctrines of the Maharajs. One of these articles says :  " The (defendant) ' walks on
</p>
<p>the support of opium, and will fall to the ground, and will never be able to get up.
</p>
<p>He is the firefly, while we (plaintiff) are the Sun." The controversy was a bona Me
</p>
<p>one on the defendant's part, long before and afler the libel. It is not, however until
</p>
<p>six months after the publication of it, that the plaintiff thinks of commencing the action
</p>
<p>for reasons best known to himself But why this long delay ? Subsequently to the
</p>
<p>publication of the alleged libel, and in the second number of his pamphlet, the plaintiff
</p>
<p>made another attack upon the defendant, accusing him of falsehood for having statad
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>90
</p>
<p>that the books of the Vallabacharya sect were kept concealed in tiie temples, lest the
</p>
<p>Brahmins should read and repudiate their doctrines. The plaintiff in one place describes
</p>
<p>the Brahmins as persons of another religion, and " not worshippers of the Supreme
</p>
<p>Being." He again attacks the defendant shortly afterwards and applies to him (the defen-
</p>
<p>dant) the very words of the libel :  " What hypocrisy I Oh, you Vyshnovs, you see
</p>
<p>whose is the rascality and whose the hypocrisy !" So unconscious was the defendant of
</p>
<p>any impropriety or offence against the plaintiff that, in the month of November 1860,
</p>
<p>afler the publication of the alleged libel, he wrote in his paper a calm survey of the
</p>
<p>public career of Juduiiathji Maharaj, this unworthy champion of monstrous doctrines, on
</p>
<p>his departure for Surat. In this survey of plaintiffs career, defendant writes to the
</p>
<p>following effect in his issue of the 18th November 18G1 : 
</p>
<p>" We have thus made a note of the career of Jadunathji Maharaj during his short
</p>
<p>stay in Bombay. In concluding this note we beg permission to give our impartial opinion
</p>
<p>about Shri Jadunathji Maharaj. The praises of this Maharaj formerly published in the
</p>
<p>Satm P)-akash paper are not lessened by the subsequent controversy. Of all the Maharajs
</p>
<p>who are known to us, Shri Jadunathji ISIaharaj has been found to be the most courageous and
</p>
<p>the most discriminating. Without regard to the unjust means the said Maharaj has latterly
</p>
<p>adopted to injure us, we must say that by a public approval of female education the Maharaj
</p>
<p>has rendered himself worthy of no little respect. Had not the poet Narmadashankar
</p>
<p>erred, and had he not plunged him into the remarriage controversy, we should this day
</p>
<p>have seen the Maharaj advancing instead of retiring from the field of reform. But often
</p>
<p>times some slight incidents prove unfavorable. The same is the case now, and we are
</p>
<p>really sorry for it. * * * '^' ? -;t * * * ^- *
</p>
<p>" O religious preceptors I You are not our enemies. You have not in any way
</p>
<p>injured us. We entertain no malice against you. We wish that you may receive all
</p>
<p>due respect as religious preceptors. And we have not had any business or dealings with
</p>
<p>you. Then, religious preceptors, why should w^e entertain any malice against you
</p>
<p>and annoy you without cause ? If, in telling you the truth, any hard words have ever been
</p>
<p>used, do you forgive us. Remember that those who become flatterers and do not en-
</p>
<p>deavour to lead you from a crooked path, are your enemies in the shape of friends.
</p>
<p>And those are your true friends who warn you that if you do not leave the crooked
</p>
<p>path your persuasion and dignity will be prejudiced. O ! we heartily wish that you
</p>
<p>would quit the evil path and come up on the good path that we may never be under
</p>
<p>the necessity of writing anything acrimonious."

<p>Jadunathji, then addressed the ignorant Vyshnovs as follows :  " The editor of the
</p>
<p>^atya Prakash defiles our religion ]  are you not going to punish him ?" The defendant
</p>
<p>most emphatically denied that charge in his paper.
</p>
<p>On the 18th November 1860, so far as the defendant was concerned, the con-
</p>
<p>troversy with the plaintiff was abandoned. The action was commenced in May 1861,
</p>
<p>and the notice which called upon the defendant to retract his statements in his very
</p>
<p>next issue, was written in the last week of April. That was indeed a very long interval
</p>
<p>after the publication of the libel, and this was but a very short notice to consider and
</p>
<p>retract. The defendant accordingly, in the next issue of his journal, said he saw nothing
</p>
<p>to alter or retract in what he had written, and nothing to apologize for, as required
</p>
<p>by the plaintiff. Now, whatever may have dictated the spirit of the libel it was evident in the
</p>
<p>opinion of the learned counsel, that the plaintiff, in filing the action, acted so from a desire to
</p>
<p>injure the defendant, against whom he cherished ill will, and by no means from a sense of public
</p>
<p>justice, for the extracts cited above had shown the absence of malice on the part of the
</p>
<p>defendant, k strange circumstance it appeared to be that the plaintiff should have taken full
</p>
<p>91
</p>
<p>six months to deliberate on the tendency of the article. By the statute of limitations, ac-
</p>
<p>cording to the new Indian Act, a period of one year only is allowed for instituting
</p>
<p>libel actions, whereas the plaintiff allowed half the time to elapse in coming to an opinion
</p>
<p>whether it was a libel or no libel. Coupled with the above was the singular fact that
</p>
<p>even after the libel, the plaintiff prosecuted and continued the controversy with the
</p>
<p>defendant ! ! It was a precious long time, certainly, for the plaintiff to find out the
</p>
<p>grievances he had suffered I The real solution of the problem lay in the fact, that the
</p>
<p>Vaishnavs showed themselves determined not to be subject to the plaintiff or any other
</p>
<p>Maharaj in matters of education ; and the plaintiff sought to revenge himself upon the
</p>
<p>defendant for this beneficial change in public opinion.
</p>
<p>The circumstances to which he had alluded at such length, would, the learned
</p>
<p>counsel trusted, throw some light on the history of the case. Now, as the action was
</p>
<p>commenced, it became necessary for the defendant to protect himself by such means as
</p>
<p>he might be advised to adopt, and he was aware that the libel could be justified in
</p>
<p>every particular. The new enquiries which he instituted, further satisfied him of
</p>
<p>the correctness of his views ; and learned men, who knew nothing of the history of
</p>
<p>the case, would tell their Lordships that the passage alleged to contain the libel, though
</p>
<p>it was obscure, was capable of the meaning which the defendant gave it. It bears onlv
</p>
<p>a hyphothetical meaning, and is but the enunciation of doctrines given to the world by
</p>
<p>the plaintiffs ancestors. It is this, " If you will act according to your precept,
</p>
<p>the precept of your ancestors, why then must you defile the wives and daughters of your
</p>
<p>devotees !" And what is the character of their " sacred books" so reverenced by Mr.
</p>
<p>Bayley ? Why, they contain nothing but the most obscene and beastly adventures. If
</p>
<p>the Maharaj s are to pursue amorous sport, putting their arms round the necks of their
</p>
<p>female devotees ; if such are the doctrines of their sacred books ! the defendant is
</p>
<p>justified in calling upon the plaintiff, who had set himself up as a monitor and a propagator
</p>
<p>of his religion, to begin by desisting from such practices and so to admonish the other Maharajs.
</p>
<p>They claim to be considered, as Krishna was considered in former days, each the husband of
</p>
<p>many women and the " ocean of Kas Lila." It has been (for the plaintiff) shown that
</p>
<p>they received the public in one room, at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, where the
</p>
<p>darkness of the hour favoured the designs of some evil minded men ; and that a portion
</p>
<p>of the public which consists of women of certain attractions, are received into another
</p>
<p>room, towards which the Maharaj first bends his steps and is followed into it by the
</p>
<p>women. It would be shown by evidence such as any of the Ecclesiastical Courts at

</p>
<p>home would deem sufficient, that adultery is committed in that room. It would be shown
</p>
<p>that the plaintiff had been bred and brought up in the adulterous doctrines of the sect,
</p>
<p>and that he at one time maintained that adulterine inteixourse with the devotees of the
</p>
<p>Maharajs leads to the strengthening and development of the body, and is akin to the
</p>
<p>physical education of athletes. And this is the leader of high caste Brahmins, the
</p>
<p>incarnation of God on earth, the gentleman, in short, as one of the learned counsel
</p>
<p>called him ; and these are the professions and practices of a man who says he has
</p>
<p>sustained demage by the libel ! (The learned counsel then made some remarks upon
</p>
<p>the absence of the Maharaj from the Court, though he had been served with a summons,
</p>
<p>and upon the fact that not a single Bhattia witness had been called for the plaintiffs
</p>
<p>case.) It would be shown, Mr. Anstey went on to say, that the language made use of
</p>
<p>by the defendant is not at all excessive, and that it is only expressive of an honest
</p>
<p>indignation against the doctrines of sacred books, which are full of blasphemies and tales
</p>
<p>92
</p>
<p>of adulterous practices, and in which adultery itself is held up as commendable. (Alludes to
</p>
<p>the story mentioned by one of plaintiffs witnesses, according to which the husband anointed
</p>
<p>and dressed his wife, and upon his shoulders carried her to the house of the intended
</p>
<p>adulterer.) The Court would learn from the mouths of the witnesses that the doctrines of
</p>
<p>the sacred books enforce the culture of adulterine love and sensual lust towards the leaders
</p>
<p>(the Maharajs,) and it is said that these are the only means of " the deliverance of the
</p>
<p>soul and its re-absorption into the Divine essence,"  as if God meant Jadoonathjee Maharaj
</p>
<p>(suffering under a loathsome disease) to propitiate Him, by engaging in hot love with his
</p>
<p>devotees ! But, say these preceptors of religion, " This principle which we teach is not a
</p>
<p>barren principle ; it must bear fruit. To each of us, (himself a Krishna,) you will offer
</p>
<p>your body, your soul, your wives, your sons, your daughters, your ' tun mun, and dhun'
</p>
<p> (your body, mind and property). If you wish to serve God, and we are God to you,
</p>
<p>do it in this three-fold manner." The sense of this application of body in reference to
</p>
<p>woman, the learned counsel would leave to the Court to infer. A true Vaishnav is en-
</p>
<p>joined to feel no shame and no regard to public opinion ; and that is service with the
</p>
<p>"mun," mind "dhun" property of every kind. And say the Maharajs, " Before you enjoy
</p>
<p>any portion of your ' dhun,' you must offer it, him, or her to your God, personified in us ;
</p>
<p>you have no right to enjoy it before us." These practices were commonly known and com-
</p>
<p>monly spoken of in the sect, but until the time of Goculuathjee, no Maharaj had the audacity
</p>
<p>to illustrate the three grand principles. " That doctrine," says defendant to the plaintiff, " I
</p>
<p>call upon you to denounce ; and I call upon you especially, Jadoonathjee Maharaj, because
</p>
<p>the others are sinking deeper and deeper still, while you alone of their number once came
</p>
<p>forward to propagate your religion ! and if your words are not so many impostures, do you
</p>
<p>admonish your other Maharajs, do you scorn the writer of the commentary (repudiate the
</p>
<p>doctrines of it, according to one translation,) and such of you as defile the wives and
</p>
<p>daughters of your devotees, according to the doctrines of that commentary, desist from that,
</p>
<p>if you wish to propagate your own religious faith, and to be heard." The defendant is
</p>
<p>thus addressing himself to those who have set themselves up as teachers ; and says to them,
</p>
<p>" unless you do so and so, you cannot expect to be heard." If the Court, Mr. Anstey
</p>
<p>remarked, had once any doubt as to the meaning of that passage in the libel, it must
</p>
<p>now vanish.
</p>
<p>As to the nature of the evidence, Mr. Anstey remarked that the plaintifTs secretary,
</p>
<p>ever since the Bhattia Conspiracy Case, had been trying to dissuade defendants' witnesses
</p>
<p>from appearing in Court, threatening them with excommunication. The difficulties of

</p>
<p>obtaining evidence in cases like this are great every where, but here they were
</p>
<p>magnified by the Maharaj's attempt to withdraw from the ken of the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>all of his sect who are likely to give evidence in behalf of the defendants. For these
</p>
<p>reasons, Mr. Ansty said, the defendants were entitled to the utmost indulgence which
</p>
<p>the Law of England, as administered by their Lordships, would allow. There was
</p>
<p>evidence that the Maharaj's tyranny was not only spiritual, but was also temporal, worked
</p>
<p>by spiritual means. And such it was that a Justice of the Peace  Mr. Anstey regretted
</p>
<p>to say, the man was still a Justice of the Peace  admitted having subscribed his name
</p>
<p>to the " slavery bond," a document whereby he bound himself to excommunicate all
</p>
<p>persons in his caste who should write against these doctrines or attempt to procure the
</p>
<p>Maharaj's presence in the Supreme Court. The signatures to that document were not
</p>
<p>fully obtained until an interdict was issued and the temples were closed, and the de-
</p>
<p>Totees were denied for some days the beatific vision of the image ! ! Allusion was next
</p>
<p>93
</p>
<p>made to the visits of the Maharajs to the sick beds of dying persons, and their putting
</p>
<p>(for fees received) their holy feet on the breasts of those apparently in the last throes
</p>
<p>of their agony and struggle with death. When all the evidence was given, the Court
</p>
<p>would, Mr. Anstey had no doubt, be of opinion that the plea of justification as to the
</p>
<p>language was fully sustained. He hoped their Lordships had been now enabled to understand
</p>
<p>much that was at first unintelligible. There was no evidence of any Iqss to entitle
</p>
<p>the plaintiff to damages ; on the contrary, it was stated that he was respected as much
</p>
<p>as ever before, though not so much loved : and no doubt there were averments in the
</p>
<p>plea to make intelligible that sectarian distinction.
</p>
<p>Seveyith day, Tuesday, 4:tk February 1862.
</p>
<p>(1.)  Karsandass Mooljee, examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I am one of the defendants in
</p>
<p>this case, and a Bania, about 28 years of age. I was born in the Yallabhacharya sect.
</p>
<p>I am one of those who believe in the Maharaj as a guru ; I never believed him
</p>
<p>to be a god. I was the Editor of the Satya Prakash at the time the libel appeared :
</p>
<p>the paper is since amalgamated with the Rast Goftar, and is now known as the Rast Goftar
</p>
<p>and Satya Prakash. The other defendant was merely the printer. I edited the " Stri
</p>
<p>Bodh" (a magazine for the instruction of females.) I have also written several pamphlets
</p>
<p>and books. I am somewhat familiar with the doctrines of the ancient Hindu religion.
</p>
<p>It is broken up into about a hundred sects, in some respects differing widely from each
</p>
<p>other. I am familiar with the distinction between the worshippers of Vishnu and those
</p>
<p>of Shiva : those distinctions are strongly marked. The Yallabhacharya sect are the
</p>
<p>followers of Vishnu. Both differ in morality, the creed of the Yallabhacharya does
</p>
<p>not inculcate self-denial ; I think that of Shiva does. The ancient religion is one of
</p>
<p>self-denial, mortification, and penance. The Yallabhacharya religion commenced about 375
</p>
<p>years ago. Yallabh was the founder of the creed, and a Telinga Brahmin. Luxmon
</p>
<p>Bhutt, the father of Yallabh, and Yallabh himself, were excommunicated by the Telinga
</p>
<p>Brahmins, for founding a new sect. According to the doctrines of the sect, as mentioned
</p>
<p>in the " Nij Yarta" (written in the " Brig Bhasha" language,) Yallabh, on his
</p>
<p>death, ascended to heaven in a mass of flames. The Maharajs marry among themselves :
</p>
<p>those, out of their body, who intermarry with them are outcasted. They intermarry
</p>
<p>by holding out large promises of money and other rewards. Those who intermarry with
</p>
<p>the Maharajs are poor Telinga Brahmins. In one instance of such marriage tchich
</p>
<p>came under my notice, I think the Telinga Brahmin was poor. I am prepared to state
</p>
<p>that the Maharajas are not Brahmins of high caste, and that the creed of Yallubh is

</p>
<p>of a modern date. They are not the preceptors of the ancient Hindu religion to any
</p>
<p>body. As a general rule, the Yaishunavs receive religious instruction in their own peculiar
</p>
<p>doctrines from the Maharajas. In respect to other opinions they receive instruction from
</p>
<p>the Brahmins. The learned Brahmins openly teach the doctrines of the ancient religion.
</p>
<p>The Maharajas conceal their doctrines : there is a prohibition against revealing them. [A
</p>
<p>good deal of discussion took place here as to the unfitness of the witness to speak with
</p>
<p>authority on matters of which he could have no personal knowledge. Mr. Bayley objected
</p>
<p>that the witness's statements, being founded upon hearsay evidence, could not be admitted.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey replied to the objection by citing one or two leading cases, in which he
</p>
<p>had the honour to appear, and in which it was solemnly decided by learned Judges,
</p>
<p>in England that a witness, a litterateur and a scholar, is competent to speak on subjects
</p>
<p>which come within the line of his studies]. Witness to Court  I have given considerable
</p>
<p>94
</p>
<p>attention to the religion of the Vallubhacharya sect, and am acquainted with the " Bri^
</p>
<p>Bhasha' language. I am not acquainted with Sanscrit. [Sir Joseph Arnould said the
</p>
<p>difficulty was how to consider the witness, although a litterateur, as a professional" or
</p>
<p>official witness. Mr. Anstey remarked he did not bring forward the witness as a pro-
</p>
<p>fessional man, but as one who, from his studies as an author and a controversiahst,
</p>
<p>was competent to speak with some authority upon the questions asked him. (Cites the
</p>
<p>case in Nisi Prius of BanFs vs. Buckingham. The learned counsel said the objection,
</p>
<p>if not overruled, would be fatal to the entire ease for the justification. It was very
</p>
<p>hard to believe that the witness should not be considered competent to give evidence on
</p>
<p>matters involved in the libel itself, and in respect to which he had been conducting
</p>
<p>discussions for several months past, and with which, therefore, he had an every day
</p>
<p>familiarity. Mr. Bayley replied that the point was very simple. The witness is
</p>
<p>asked as to the contents of a book which, for aught he knew, might be in the
</p>
<p>witness's pocket at the moment ; and therefore the very best evidence ought to be
</p>
<p>produced. Sir Joseph Anould.  But it is not so in respect to books of science. Mr.
</p>
<p>Bayley spoke further in support of his argument. The question was not as to cases of
</p>
<p>foreign law, but as to the contents of a book which was in existence. The witness
</p>
<p>could not be asked to give the contents of a book which is available. Sir M. Sausse
</p>
<p>said, the question was put to the witness whether there was any prohibition against
</p>
<p>revealing the tenets of the Vallabacharyas ? to which he replied that there was a prohibition
</p>
<p>or penalty mentioned in a book. Mr. Bayley raised an objection to the writness
</p>
<p>being questioned upon the contents of the book. The Court thought those tenets
</p>
<p>could be proved by the evidence either of the teacher, or the sectary who has
</p>
<p>received instruction. The first mode would be reliable, and the second v/ould be
</p>
<p>an admissible mode of giving evidence. If a witness be asked to state what is
</p>
<p>contained in a particular book, and if he said he had read the book for some
</p>
<p>years of his life, the sectary so interrogated must produce the book and read from
</p>
<p>it, Sir Joseph Arnould concurred with the Chief Justice. The evidence of the
</p>
<p>" taught" is admissible evidence, but any evidence of the contents of any particular
</p>
<p>book is inadmissible unless the book itself be produced.]
</p>
<p>Witness continued.  " Whoever divulges the secrets of his spiritual guide, or of
</p>
<p>the " Shree Thackoorjee," or the image, or the God, shall be born again in the condi-
</p>
<p>tion of a dog. The number of doctrines taught by the Maharajas are of such a
</p>
<p>nature that learned Brahmins are not in a position to teach them. The doctrines which

<p>(rt) When Hari (God) is displeased [with any one] the Guru* eaves him [from the
</p>
<p>effects of Hari's displeasure]. But when the Guru is displeased [with any one], no one
</p>
<p>can save him [from the effects of Guriis displeasure]. Therefore a Vaishnav should serve
</p>
<p>the Guru with his body and money and please the Guru.
</p>
<p>(i^) But the principal Gurus are Shri Acharyaji and Shri Gusainji and their whole
</p>
<p>family (called) the Valabha family. They are all Gurus as is mentioned in the Sarvottamji.
</p>
<p>(c) Therefore God and the Guru are necessarily to be worshipped. If a man worships
</p>
<p>God, he goes to Vyapi Vaikunth.f But by the worship of God he goes to Vyapi Vaikunth
</p>
<p>only, when he worships the Guru. The worship of the Guru is to be performed in the
</p>
<p>same way as the worship of God.

<p>are to reflect thus :  " In this world there are many kinds of creatures. Of them all, we
</p>
<p>are most fortunate that we have sought the protection of the illustrious Vallabhacharyaji,

<p>is his own ; consequently the sin of adultery does not affect Him.
</p>
<p>The sin of enjoying other people's things, affects this world. With God nothing whatever

<p>his wife, what sin and immorality are contained therein ! How sinful therefore are
</p>
<p>those who entertain towards God the adulterine love." Thus have they argued. Now
</p>
<p>the intelligent should consider this matter as follows : The GopisJ made the
</p>
<p>adulterine love with Shri Krishna (is it to be maintained that) therefore they
</p>
<p>committed sin ? Further, Mahadevji and Ramchandarji married women of this
</p>
<p>world, namely, Parvatiji (and) Sitaji ; and Shri Krishna married sixteen thousand prin-
</p>
<p>cesses :  (now) it would follow from the argument of these fools, that they too, acted
</p>
<p>improperly. If as between God and this world there had existed only the relation of father
</p>
<p>and children (as maintained by them) then Shri Krishna would not have married these
</p>
<p>maidens. But in God all relations abide. Both man and woman have sprung from God.
</p>
<p>Wherefore with God the two species of man and woman do not exist. Both these are the
</p>
<p>spirit of God. Consequently he is at play with his own spirit. In that no sin is incurred

</p>
<p>either by Ged: or by (this) world. If any sin be* cpmmittcd (by such conduct) Shri
</p>
<p>iKiislinawoull not have married the daughters of the kings. (Thus you) see how much
</p>
<p>contrary to the SU'istras have they represented the snliject and confounded the igroiant.
</p>
<p>If there bef any sin connniited in entertaining the ad^ilterine love towards God, Ihen llie
</p>
<p>most excellent Being would never have gran ed to the Veds (liieir) requ 'St, to entertain
</p>
<p>the adulterine love. I'hat Story is related liy Biahmaji to Bhrigu Ri&hi in Brahad \ aaian

<p>
</p>
<p>, (Sanscrit text quoted.)
</p>
<p>Meaning  Having heard the long offered prayers of the Veds, the Lord spoke in a
</p>
<p>heavenly voice :  " Oh ! you Traditions I am pleased with you wherefore ask such favors
</p>
<p>as you may desire." When Shri Krishna so spoke, the Traditions said : 
</p>
<p>(Sanscrit text quoted.)
</p>
<p>Meaning  " Oh Lord we regard all thy forms such as Narayan and others as, Brahma
</p>
<p>invested with attribu es in regard to which our belief is not full. And as to that which
</p>
<p>we call (usi;ally) by the term Brahma, the form of which is without attributes, and which
</p>
<p>is different from the indestiuclible Brahma  that form is beyond the reach of our mind
</p>
<p>and our speech, therefore beyond o^r knowledge  we request thee therefore, to cause us to
</p>
<p>see that f..rm" Thus spoke the Traditions of the Veds. 'i'hereupon Shri Kri lina, the
</p>
<p>most excellent Being showed (them) his all occupying heaven, and allowed himself to be
</p>
<p>seen. Tiie kind of sight which the Traditions had on that occasion is thus described.
</p>
<p>(Sanscrit text quoted.)
</p>
<p>Meaning  On that occasion the Traditions having seen the form of Shri Krishna, com-
</p>
<p>menced to praise him thus : " Oh Shri Krishna, thy form is more beautiful than even a
</p>
<p>crore of Kiimdevs,| at the sight whereof, desire is produced in us. Please therefore satisfy
</p>
<p>our heart's desire, so that we may enjoy with thee in the form of women. If thou wishest
</p>
<p>to grant our request, this is what we require." When the Traditions of the Veds sjjqjie
</p>
<p>thus, the most excellent Being said : 
</p>
<p>(Sanscrit ten quoted.)
</p>
<p>Meaning  " Oh Traditions this your heart's desire is vrry difficult to be satisfied and
</p>
<p>very difficult to carry out ; however as I consent thereto, your heart's desire shall be satis-
</p>
<p>fied ; but it wiJ. not be satislied just now." He (further) said :

<p>your adulterine love for me will exceed all (otlier love.) By means of such a love,
</p>
<p>you will giiin n)e and your object will be thus ficcompli.hed." In this manner Shri
</p>
<p>Krishna toM the Traditions to gain (him) by adulterine love. These Traditions of the
</p>
<p>Vtds who became the Gopikas are called the Traditional persons.

</p>
<p>In the enme way, it is related in the Eamaya'n as follows : ("When) Phri T?am-
</p>
<p>chanrlraji pmcee 'ed to the forest of Dandaka (lie found) tliere sixteen thousand IJisliis
</p>
<p>(sages) called Agnikumar peifornung prnanee. 'I'liese ]{isliis on seeing tlie person of Stiii
</p>
<p>lliiMicliaixiraji, became enamoured. 'I'liereupnn, folding lluir hands, they made a request
</p>
<p>to Slni Ramchandniji thus  " Oh Lord, a desire is produced in us to enjoy vvilh Uiee
</p>
<p>in the firm of women. Wherefore be pleased to gratily ibis our liearl's desire."
</p>
<p>Kamchandraji thereupon having been pleased, granted their request (by saying") " tliis
</p>
<p>your hearts's desire will be gratified during the incarnation of Krishna." llence tliese
</p>
<p>Agni Kumar liishis became Gopis in Vrij, wliose name is Agiiikumar  Gopikas. 'J he
</p>
<p>tale thereof is recounted in the Kurnia (Tortoise) Puran and also in Alharva
</p>
<p>Ved thus :  
</p>
<p>(Sanscrit verse quoted.)
</p>
<p>Meaning  These jAgnikuniar TJishis having been born as women in Yrij, also
</p>
<p>attained the most excellent Being with the Traditions.
</p>
<p>Thus it is related in the Veds and Puraiis, at various places, that by whatsoever
</p>
<p>faith, this soul may serve , God, Hari gratifies her desires accordingly, if there be
</p>
<p>any sin committed in the adulterine love, why did bhri Krishna and ISl.ri Kamchimdraji
</p>
<p>grant them their wish to be wotnen. They would have been displeased tliere and
</p>
<p>then and punished (them). But God is all form. He is in the form of father and
</p>
<p>he is in the form of husband, he is in the iorm of brother (and) he is in the
</p>
<p>form of son. In whatsoever shape one may (wish to) love God, his wishes are
</p>
<p>complied with accordingly. Kandrayji and VaFudevji asked the boon of tiie son-form
</p>
<p>and their wishes of having ((iod ior) their son, were granted. The Gopis loved (God)
</p>
<p>as their paramour, and he became a {laramour and niadw them happy. And this the
</p>
<p>ignorant say is sin. How contrary is what they say to the Veds and Burans. On
</p>
<p>tliis subject a devotee has said 'n the 8aki (verse) thus ; '' what can the ass wlio
</p>
<p>feeds on the dunghill know the pleasures of the Garden ? Sugar is his death, the world's
</p>
<p>refuse, his life." Meaning  the Asses who feed on dur.ghills, what do they know of
</p>
<p>the pleasures of gardens ? that such and such pleasures are to be had in gardens !
</p>
<p>By eating sugar the ass dies ; aiid by eating the rubbish that lies on dunghills he
</p>
<p>lives. Siir.ilarly,* those devotees who long for the Para-brahma, (Bivine Sfiirit), their
</p>
<p>life is sustained by this very adulterine love. What could the non-devotcts know of
</p>
<p>this love : they wish for the love of hell. (To them) to get (go"d) bodies, women
</p>
<p>and property, is to meet with God. Even, by exjierience, it is clearly known that

</p>
<p>there is no love in any thing like adulterine love. We are therefore enjoined in the
</p>
<p>Shastras to feel in Hari a love like the adulterine love. For, see ! although the
</p>
<p>adulteress may he engaged in the household work, yet d.iv and night, her mind is
</p>
<p>directed to the object of meeting her paramour, and if ' t.^ r) paramour goes to a
</p>
<p>foreign country, in consequence of (her) separation I'rom hiu , she does not relish (her)
</p>
<p>food, does not like to wear good ornaments, and by the excessive grief consequent on
</p>
<p>the separation, she even gi es up her liie. To feel such love towards God is described
</p>
<p>in the Shastras as the most exfcHent thing. Of suih lov<-', these fools say tliat this
</p>
<p>love is loathsome. But it is no-where irsentioned that by the adulterine love (we should)
</p>
<p>carry on a c iminal intercourse with Gi d ; because our souls are not qua ified like the
</p>
<p>Gopis ; nor could our souls have immediate connection with God. We will illustrate
</p>
<p>this by an anecdote. A certain woman was one evening going to her paramour. At the
</p>
<p>same time a Fukeer was sitting in (her) way praying to God. But as it was dark she
</p>
<p>did not observe the Fukeer and (accideiitly) struck him with her foot in passing, of which
</p>
<p>she was unconscious. Just then the Fukeer did not say any thing. liut when that
</p>
<p>woman returned, that Fukeer addressed her thus., ' Oh hussy, you struck me w th your
</p>
<p>loot and passed on but then my attention being fixed on God, 1 did not speak." Thereufion
</p>
<p>the woman replied thus " Had your attention been so fixed tn God, you w- uld not have
</p>
<p>* If iMs sentence should mal<e out an nnalopy brtvreen the filth loving ass and the aspirer
</p>
<p>after the divjue spirit, the fault should not be atlribuud to the translator but to his text,
</p>
<p>been conscious of my having struck you with my foot. See, owing to my contemptible
</p>
<p>love in my paraniour, 1 did n'>t ol)3erve you and was not even conscious of h.iving struck
</p>
<p>3'ou with my loot. (;h man ! had your l(tve re.illy b<'on in (Jud and your attention fixed
</p>
<p>upon him, how could you have known of my foot having struck you." No soouf^r liad the
</p>
<p>Fukeer heard this tlum he seized iiis own ear* and prostrated himself at Iter feet (and
</p>
<p>said)  '' Oh mother what you have now observed is true. From this day I have adopted you
</p>
<p>as my spiritual guide. In this anecdote also a lesson is drawn from loye. As Dattatraya
</p>
<p>JKushi derived instruction from twenty-four things, so should we draw the moral frum the
</p>
<p>adulterine love. Thus (we see that our religion) does not tell us to commit adultery.
</p>
<p>1'he devotees of Hari know the intrinsic vidue of tiiis principle as pointed out in a verse.
</p>
<p>She who is in labour can alone know the pain (of birth.)
</p>
<p>She who is not in labour pulls her by the cheeks (to silence her.)
</p>
<p>The woman separa ed from her lover (can alone) know her grief.
</p>
<p>Such is also the cas'^ with devotion alone.
</p>
<p>Moreover in the same chapter in which the compliance with Tradition's rec^uest (ia
</p>
<p>related) it is (further) stated.
</p>
<p>(Sariscrit text quoted.)
</p>
<p>Meaning  If either man or woman serves Hari with real devotion, he or she will
</p>
<p>gain their wishes in the same way as the Traditions gained (theirs.) It is also stated in
</p>
<p>the Shastras that whatever may be the object with which one serves the L'>rd, such his
</p>
<p>object the Lord will fuifil. This is what is staled. Wlierefore those who have good sight,
</p>
<p>shculd not walk by [mtting their hands on the shoulders of the blind,  as is said in the
</p>
<p>Verse : 
</p>
<p>" Whoever shall walk by placing his hand '^n the shoulder of the blind, will full into a
</p>
<p>hole, though a good man, and remain behind."
</p>
<p>Those, who do not know the Sliastras, are in the Shastras called blind. The people
</p>
<p>with eyes should not believe their stories, and shutiing their eyes, walk by p'acing their
</p>
<p>hands on their shoulders ; for, the intention of those who keep bad company, i; to pollute
</p>
<p>the Hindus. They thereiure by every way find fault witii and misrepresent the Sliastras,
</p>
<p>wishnig to pollute the people. To this end is inijiroven'ent (or civihzaiion) going on in
</p>
<p>Bombay ; and it spreads to other countries also. This 2nd chapter on the adulterine love

<p>is now concluded.

<p>There are maidens in the house of Jasodaji (mother of Krishna) they regard Krishna

<p>him to a Jungle, and there was a temple of God in a certain Sjint in that Jungle.
</p>
<p>The two persons, having gone there, used to sweep and clear the temple and tlien
</p>
<p>rest themselves there. They did so for several days, when  being overpowered with
</p>
<p>love, they took to singing. They then both got up from that place, and went to their
</p>
<p>respective houses. Afterwards, some one came and told the husband of the woman,
</p>
<p>that his wife lived (or was in love) with such and such man. and that those two persons were

<p>in the habit of going *o such and such place in such and such dungle. Afterwards, one diiy, the

<p>The 75th Vaishnav. A narrative of Krishnadas Brahmin, a devotee of Shri
</p>
<p>Acharyaji,* the great lord. Krishnadas was living in a village. He was a worshipper
</p>
<p>of Bluigvat (God.) There were five or ten Va;slmavs, who, on one occasion, were
</p>
<p>going to Adelf for the pur|)ose of paying their homage to Shri Acharyaji, the great
</p>
<p>Lord. 'J liey came to the house of Krishnadas. At liiat time, Krishnadas was not at
</p>
<p>home. He had gone out on some business, and the wife of Krishnadas was (at home.)
</p>
<p>AViien the Vaishnavs came to the village, Shri Krishnadas had gone out to some
</p>
<p>(other) village. Alter that, she went inside the house, and began to consider as to
</p>
<p>what she should do now. She tlien recollected, that the Banian iJainiaro ? always said
</p>
<p>to her, that she should meet him, (and that) he would give her what she might ask
</p>
<p>for. So she said to lit^rself/ " I will fetch [irovisions and other articles from his shop
</p>
<p>today, and will tell Irm, I will meet you today"  "Give me the provisions and other
</p>
<p>articles, that 1 require." Having made this determination, she set out went to bis
</p>
<p>shop, and having given a promise to hun, the woman brought all the provisions,
</p>
<p>and other articles ; and having come home, prepared the dinner, and presented an
</p>
<p>offering, of it to Shri 'Ihakurji ((lod) ; and havii;g removed the offering, at due time,
</p>
<p>she caused the Vaishnavs to feast on the blessed food, of which the Vaishnavs
</p>
<p>partook in good style. Afier that, Krishnadas came (home) in the evening, met all the
</p>
<p>Vaishnavs, and after saluting them he entered his house, and asked his wife, what the
</p>
<p>news was, and whtiher she had given fond to the Vaishnavs. She replied that she iiad
</p>
<p>given them fiod ; wlien Krishnadas inquired, whence she had got the provisions, and otlier
</p>
<p>articles ; wlien the v.oman related (to him) all that had taken place. Krishnadas was
</p>
<p>thereupon much pleased with diis) wife. Afterwards, the husband and wife both jointly

</p>
<p>paitook of the blessed fuod, and Krishnadas then went to the Vaishnavs, and passed the
</p>
<p>whole night in talking on the (iraise of God. When it was morning, Krishnadas having
</p>
<p>despatched all the Vaishnavs, they walked away, and Krishnadas went with them, to a
</p>
<p>short distance, to see them off. Afterwards, he came home, presented the food offering to
</p>
<p>S'n-i Thakurji (God>, and then having removed thein as usual, he covered them up, and
</p>
<p>p'lC'd them aside. When Krishnadas returned !iome in the evening, both the h sband and
</p>
<p>wife j'lintly partook of the blessed food. Krishnadas then said to his wife :  " You gave a
</p>
<p>p omise yesterday to the Banian, and the Ixmiaii must be expecting (youl, and that there-
</p>
<p>fore the promise given to him must be fulfilled." The wife thereupon hav'ng rubbed her body
</p>
<p>with an ointment, and bathed herself, and having ornaments, as are usual a-i ong the
</p>
<p>: women, she set out. It was rainy season, and it had rained (that day), and there was
</p>
<p>liuid on the road, in consequence whereof Krishnadas said, " if you place yourself on my
</p>
<p>shoulder, I will convey you ih re, and return ; otherwise your feet will be soiled with mud,
</p>
<p>as tliere is a grtat dial of mud on the road; and if your feet should get soiled, the
</p>
<p>Banian would treat you with disrespect."  Krishnadas, tlureu|ion placed his wife on his shoulder,
</p>
<p>and placed her down near the shop of the Jianian ; whin tlie woman called out to the
</p>
<p>Banian, and asked liim to open the door. The Banian then opened the door, and took

<p>is a great deal of nuid on tlie rojid, and how is it that your feet are free [from iti."
</p>
<p>When the woman said to the Banian "you had belter pro'eed with your bu iness," when

<p>the Banian said, " you must till (me) the eircumstanfes"  The woman then said to the
</p>
<p>Banian :  " My husband placed me on his shoulder, brought ;ne here and went away."
</p>
<p>On hearing this account the Banian was struck with wonder and he questioned her on the
</p>
<p>whole subject, and asked the cause of it, and requested her t  tell him all ; when the
</p>
<p>woman related to him all that had occurred. On hearing it, the Ba ian thought of himself
</p>
<p>with contempt, and said, " Happy is your life whose mind is so pure" and having put

<p>his hands together in a suppliant manner, saluted (her), and said ' I'ardon me my offence"

</p>
<p>At midnight on Ekadashi in the month of Shrawan Shood, God visibly uttered the
</p>
<p>[following] words which are here repeated word for word.
</p>
<p>By entering into relation with IBrahma, all persons' sins of body and mind are washed
</p>
<p>away. These sins are said to be of five kinds, viz. those which are congenitals ; those
</p>
<p>which owe their origin to time and place ; those described in the Vedas ; those which are
</p>
<p>results of intimate association ; and such as are produced by contact. These sins are not
</p>
<p>and never to be believed in (after the above relation has been established). Otherwise
</p>
<p>(that is, when such a relation has not been contracted) expiation of sins never takes place.
</p>
<p>That which has not been, in the first instance, dedicated should not be accepted.
</p>
<p>Offerers, after making their offerings, should do with them what they like, such
</p>
<p>is the rule. That oft'ering which has (in the first instance) been engaged by its lord is
</p>
<p>not acceptable to the God of Gods. Therefore in the first instance in all doings all things
</p>
<p>should be dedicated. That which is given should not be taken because the
</p>
<p>whole comes to belong to Ilari, is the doctrine of other sects. . ("With us) the relation

<p>wliich subsists in the world between [a master and his] servants, holds good. And every

<p>thing should be done accordingly, ,that is, after dedicating it should be enjoyed, and

</p>
<p>(incarations,) God (Krishna) came to this eaith in the shape ot man ; and 16,000 " Gopees"
</p>
<p>" female cow-herds obtained salvation by falling in love with Krishna, " Ras Lila'"
</p>
<p>nieans amorous and wanton sport with women. (Witness reads the ditTerent meanings
</p>
<p>of the word ' Lila' from the late Horace Hayman "Wilson's Sanscrit and English
</p>
<p>dictionary.) There is no sport imputed to Krishna, which is not amorous sport. When
</p>
<p>a Maharaja dies, he is said to extend his journey to the other world in amorous
</p>
<p>sport. The Maharajas have neglected the instruction of the sect in their peculiar
</p>
<p>doctrines. In the strict sense of the word, they are not the preceptors of religion.
</p>
<p>The vow (or " kanthee") is applied to males and females at the age of eight or ten.
</p>
<p>Both in the songs and in the vow, reference is made to tioi, viun, and dhuu, (body,
</p>
<p>mind and property.) A person who makes a vow to give all his " dhun," binds
</p>
<p>himself to give his property, his wife, his son, and his daughter to the Maharaj or
</p>
<p>Thackooriee. I have heard of in&tances in which these offerings have been practically
</p>
<p>made by the most devoted followers of the Maharajas. It is a matter of general
</p>
<p>reputation in the sect that all the Maharajas have carnal intercourse with the wives
</p>
<p>and daughters of their more zealous devotees, Girls are sent to the Maharajas before
</p>
<p>being touched by their husbands. I know of such instances. The knowledge of these
</p>
<p>practices, among the sect does not in any way diminish the influence and respect of
</p>
<p>the Maharajas. Within the period of my recollection, the Bhattia caste, composed
</p>
<p>* [A name of Krishna.']
</p>
<p>t [Names of the river Jamna.]
</p>
<p>:!: A tide applied to the deity Balihadra the elder brother of Krkhia.
</p>
<p>109
</p>
<p>entirely of Yaishnavs, liave taken stops to put a stop to these practices of the j\Iaharajas.
</p>
<p>In 1855 the Bhattias convened a meeting of the caste, at which it was resolved that
</p>
<p>females should not be allowed to visit the Maharajas unless at certain fixed hours,
</p>
<p>when they may not have any opportunities for carnal intercourse with the Maharajas.
</p>
<p>According to the Hindoo religion, the laws of God are unalterable, as regards morality,
</p>
<p>piety, &c. It is considered a sin to act contrary to them. Adultery is a great sin.
</p>
<p>Handling the breasts of females and throwing " gulal" on their persons is considered
</p>
<p>as a sin equal to adultery, according to the Shastras. " Red powder" (gulal) is a
</p>
<p>sign of a bad design, of an adulterous character. During the Holee holidays, the
</p>
<p>Maharaj throws [ndal on the breasts of female and male devotees, and directs the current
</p>
<p>of some water of a yellow colour from a syringe upon the breasts of females. During the
</p>
<p>" Eas'" festival, wives and husbands collect promiscuously in a room, and have carnal
</p>
<p>intercourse promiscuously among them. The " Ras" festival is held unto three or four
</p>
<p>times in a month. The Maharaj has actual sexual intercourse with many women, and
</p>
<p>is called the husband of many women. I used the passage in the libel, " You
</p>
<p>Maharajas, acting up to the doctrines of that commentary," kc, in a hypothetical
</p>
<p>sense, and with no other meaning. I am not ashamed to say there was a time when
</p>
<p>I followed the doctrines of the Vallabhacharya religion more strictly than I do now. I
</p>
<p>and others have prosecuted enquiries on the subject of the religion of our sect. The
</p>
<p>views of our small party were directed towards the doctrines as well as towards the
</p>
<p>history of the religion. In my sect, particularly, our larbours have been rewarded with
</p>
<p>abuses. I was an author and a journalist before I became a reformer. The tyranny
</p>
<p>and evil practices of the Maharaj's induced me to write against them. Besides my
</p>
<p>own works, there were pamphlets, books, placards, &c., published in different languages
</p>
<p>to expose the practices of the Maharajas. They were published long before my time,
</p>
<p>and one of them was a drama written 250 years ago. There was no prosecution for
</p>
<p>libel by a Maharaj except this. My object in writing was to get the Maharajas
</p>
<p>reformed. The plaintiff had organs to oppose us. One of them was the Vishnoo Punch
</p>
<p>newspaper, patronized by plaintiff ; another was the religious pamphlet edited by plaintiff
</p>
<p>himself. Plaintiff wrote several times letters to the Chabook and Sati/a Prakash and
</p>
<p>other newspapers. The communications were made to me through Goverdhundas, plain-
</p>
<p>tiff's secretary. Plaintiff has been in Bombay for some years past ; he returned to
</p>
<p>Surat last year. He showed great interest on the subjects of female education and
</p>
<p>widow re-marriage. Subsequently, at a public meeting, plaintiff declared himself ao-ainst

<p>re-marriage. From that time, he became unfriendly to me, and discussed with me,
</p>
<p>through the publications, the questions of re-marriage and the creed of Vallubh. These
</p>
<p>are the pamphlets in which the discussion was conducted by plaintiff.

</p>
<p>The " Satya Prakash" newspaper in the issue of the first (day) of the first Aso
</p>
<p>Vad Samvut 1916 (30th September 1860) the Editor of the ' " Satya Prakash" has
</p>
<p>published and made known to all the people as follows :  In the first number of the
</p>
<p>book (periodical) entitled, " The Propagator of Religion and Annihilator of Doubt, Shri
</p>
<p>Jadunathjee Maharaj has quoted a stanza from the sacred Gita and has informed all
</p>
<p>the people, that whoever behaves contrary to the precepts of the Shastras, does not
</p>
<p>acquire happiness in the next world. But in the Ten principles his own ancestor Shri
</p>
<p>Dwarkeshjee Maharaj has inculcated that (we) should act laying aside the precepts of
</p>
<p>the Veds. Thus he has represented to the people. But in no one of the Ten principles
</p>
<p>is it stated that (we) should abandon the precepts of the Veds. Nevertheless this person
</p>
<p>(the editor) says so. But as to the meaning of the Ten principles which he has given
</p>
<p>in his paper he has extracted the same from a book called Kavi Charitra composed in
</p>
<p>Bambay by Janardhan Ramchundra and published in the Marathi language. But who
</p>
<p>knows for what reason he has assigned a contrary (i. e. wrong) meaning to these
</p>
<p>principles. Of that the Editor of the " Satya Prakash" is quite unaware ; as is described
</p>
<p>in a Shaki (couplet.)
</p>
<p>He who may walk oa the support of opium -will fall to the ground.
</p>
<p>Although he may struggle with his legs, he will never get up.
</p>
<p>Of this description is what the Editor of the " Asatya Prakash"* says. But as the
</p>
<p>light of the fire fly is rendered nought before that of the sun, so in regard to Brahm
</p>
<p>(i. e. the universal soul) will his false meaning be nullified before the true meanincr.
</p>
<p>Of that he has no conception at all. In these Ten principles of the way of strengthening
</p>
<p>(Devotion, &c.) Shri Harirayji has benefited all by giving (them) the essence of the
</p>
<p>Veds and Shastras. On these same Ten Principles Shri Dwarkeshji Maharaj has
</p>
<p>composed a short st'^nza. Therefore O Vaishnavs do you behold what is stated in this
</p>
<p>(stanza.) The musical mode of (chanting) the Ten Principles is (termed) Prabhati

</p>
<p>Propagator of our religion and the Annihilator of Doubt" No. 2 vol. 2.
</p>
<p>In (his issues of the 23rd September 1860 and 30th September) the Editor of
</p>
<p>the " Satya Prakash" has asked Shri Jadunathjee Maharaj questions as follows : 
</p>
<p>1. First question, you write that the Shastras, have been made by God. Then
</p>
<p>of the four Veds you believe in one the Yajurved. That Yajurved consists of 101
</p>
<p>Shachas (branches) of them you believe in one, the Apastambh Shaka. The others
</p>
<p>you have rejected. If the Shastras be the work of God, then all the passages should
</p>
<p>be regarded as Gods. Having put such a question it is represented to the people that
</p>
<p>he (the Maharaj) does not believe in all the Shastras, whereas he represents to the
</p>
<p>people that he believes in all the Shastras. And this statement is such as the people
</p>
<p>are likely to regard as true because among the Hindu community there prevail many
</p>
<p>ways (i. e. religious persuasions) wherefore there exists a doubt in the minds of the
</p>
<p>people as to which doctrine is true and which doctrine is false, in consequence of which
</p>
<p>people's minds are alienated from their religious persuasions.

</p>
<p>And the Editor of the "Satya Prakash" says that the works treating of Vallabh's
</p>
<p>religion are kept concealed in the mansions, lest the Brahmans should refute them.
</p>
<p>But this statement which he has made is entirt-ly incorrect. For these works written
</p>
<p>in the (Brij) language are in the houses of all the Vaishnavs. But those Vaishnavs
</p>
<p>do not give them to persons following other religious persuasions because they are not

</p>
<p>an attack upon the " reformers," that is, I and my friends. I was challenged to
</p>
<p>review the plaintiffs lecture published in his pamphlet. That was after the article,

<p>Your statement is simply that of ignorance, for I shall give a short illustration

</p>
<p>and the other has to go to Byculla. Now, he who wishes to go to Byculla goes by the
</p>
<p>way leading to Byculla, and he who wishes to go to Walkashwar goes by the way leading
</p>
<p>to Walkeshwar. Now, in the opinion (of each) of these two persons is the road followed
</p>
<p>by one anl the other (of them) a wrong (road) ? No, it is not. But why will he who
</p>
<p>does not wish to go to Byculla, go by tliat way ? Now, the established conclusion (from
</p>
<p>this is that) for souls to go to different places there are various different means mentioned
</p>
<p>in the Shastras ; consequently to whatever place a man may wish to go, the way to that
</p>
<p>place he follows.

<p>On the part of Shri Jadunatliji Maharaj a warning to the Vaishnavs.^

<p>By order of Shri Jadunathji Maharaj may it be known to all the Vaiahnavs as fol-

</p>
<p>four hundreds of thousands of wombs,"]" and dying, and it enables us to attain to (union
</p>
<p>with) the Lord. ^\n invaluable body such as this, you employ day and night in occupation
</p>
<p>tending merely to obtain a livelihood. Not only this, but you keep much bad company ; and

<p>in this life is exempted alter death from future birth throughout all the various orders of arimial
</p>
<p>existence.
</p>
<p>113
</p>
<p>for two hours even, Avith a mmd free fi-om solicitude you do not worship (the deity) Hari,
</p>
<p>or call to remembrance (his) name. Observing this I feel exceedingly concerned on your
</p>
<p>behalf, for after (the dissolution of) the body, what will be your condition ? And after (the
</p>
<p>dissolution of) the body you have to deal with (the deity) Shri Thakurji. How is it you
</p>
<p>do not meditate a little upon that ?
</p>
<p>For some time (back) the people of Bombay blamed the spiritual guides (saying)
</p>
<p>thus : The instructors of the sacred great Lord's (religious) course do not impart (spiritual)
</p>
<p>knowledge to the Vaishnavs. " But after my arrival here, the reading of (religious) books
</p>
<p>was carried on and the discussion of questions was carried on, in order that all the Vaish-
</p>
<p>navs might acquire a knowledge of their own religious course. But no Vaishnavs came to
</p>
<p>listen to that. Now what can the spiritual guides do ? In the Shastras it is said, when a
</p>
<p>pupil being anxious himself asks his instructor, then only is the instructor to give
</p>
<p>instruction to that pupil. But should he give instruction without being asked, the
</p>
<p>instruction would have no effect on the pupil's mind. Such instruction is like giving
</p>
<p>food to one who is not hungry to whom it is tasteless. Such is the mode of giving
</p>
<p>instruction prescribed in the Shastras. Still I continued to hold discussions. However
</p>
<p>when no one attended them, I caused to be printed monthly a magazine, in order to
</p>
<p>enable the Vaishnavs to acquire a knowledge of their (religious) course and intimated
</p>
<p>(that they were) to purchase that magazine. They were told to subscribe their names
</p>
<p>as purchasers of that magazine, but in the list of subscribing Vaishnavs, names have
</p>
<p>been written (the particulars of) which are written (below) for general information.
</p>
<p>In Bombay there are about 12,000 twelve thousand houses of Bhatias Vaishnavs,
</p>
<p>of whom 5,000 five thousand are Marjadis.* And the Bhatias assume the name of
</p>
<p>" worshippers of Vaishnu alone," and are considered the chief of all the followers (of
</p>
<p>Vallabh) of all these Bhatias only 100, one hundred individuals have written their
</p>
<p>names and of the Banias 120, one hundred and twenty names have been written.
</p>
<p>There are four Brahmans, eight Marwadis, and two Mooltani Vaishnavs. Out of the whole city
</p>
<p>of Bombay so many names have been written. As to most of the names they have
</p>
<p>been written by poor people.
</p>
<p>From this it will be immediately perceived by all persons what sort of under-
</p>
<p>standing the people of Bombay have. No one cares to understand his own (religious)
</p>
<p>course. Not only this, but no one cares even to obtain (the favor of) Shri Thakurji.
</p>
<p>It clearly appears that the only thing they care about is blaming their spiritual guides.
</p>
<p>Now in this matter I am helpless.

<p>Alas ! O Vaishnavs, you have come and sought the protection of the sacred great
</p>
<p>Lord. Therefore I find it necessary for me to advise you to understand your (religious)
</p>
<p>course. If you do not understand it, what will be your condition in the end ? Reflect
</p>
<p>on that consi'lering you as my (disciples) I thought of imparting to you a knowledge of
</p>
<p>your (religious) course through the magazine, for which, however, you could not subscribe.
</p>
<p>Consequently it appears that you do not care to read even books relating to your own
</p>
<p>'(religious) course. You will have indeed to spend R. | ^'^^ ^h^ magazine, but by
</p>
<p>reading it you will be exceedingly benefited. In the first place you will understand
</p>
<p>your (religious) course, as it is contained in the Shastras, by (understanding) which
</p>
<p>you cannot be corrupted by evil company. Not only this, but you will be able to
</p>
<p>answer the objections urged against your excellent (religious) course by several people
</p>
<p>without understanding it. Secondly you will acquire a love for devotion directed to (the
</p>
<p>deity) Hari. In consequence of that love you will obtain (the favor of) Shri Thakurji,
</p>
<p>and you will be exempt from the pains of (successive) birth and death, and from the
</p>
<p>pains of hell. Do you therefore open your eyes and reflect a little. You will not
</p>
<p>again obtain such an opportunity of understanding your (religious) course.
</p>
<p>Copies of the Magazine for this month of Bhadarva (August, September) having been
</p>
<p>printed have arrived. Therefore every Vaishnav who cares to understand his (religious)
</p>
<p>course, and who may care to obtain (the favor of the deity) Hari should come to my place,
</p>
<p>and he is to take (a copy of) the Magazine, and write his name for a copy monthly in

<p> ' Attempts were made to injure me, and to put me out of my caste, but without
</p>
<p>success, as the castemen were affaid lest I should institute an action of damages. The
</p>
<p>plaintiff and his agents asked the Vaishnavs not to subscribe to my periodical. One
</p>
<p>Kanjee told me so. These attempts were made before this action was filed. I received
</p>
<p>a notice of this action about the end of April 1861. I repHed to that notice in the
</p>
<p>Rast Goftar and Satt/a Prakash of 5th May. It is the tyranny of the Maharajas
</p>
<p>which makes the Vaishanvs obedient : they don't allow a man who has incurred their
</p>
<p>displeasure, to visit the temple. Visiting the temple once in a day is indispensable.
</p>
<p>115
</p>
<p>I have seen Maharajs put their feet on the breasts of dying men, with the view of puri-
</p>
<p>fying them of sin. Eewards are paid for this, Es. 5 to Rs. 1,000. A penalty is attached to
</p>
<p>the breach of the " Kanthee" vow. The general character of the Maharajs in my sect
</p>
<p>is " adulterous" and licentious. The plaintiff is known to be debaucherous. " The conse-
</p>
<p>quence of the Maharaja's practices has been general debauchery in the sect ; and great
</p>
<p>scandal and shamelessness prevail. The dedication or bowing of maidens to the Maharajs
</p>
<p>before marriage, has given occasion to these practices. The Maharaj is called, also,
</p>
<p>" one whose sole aim is amorous sport with women," Certain portions of the sect, the
</p>
<p>Marjadees, consider these practices as meritorious, and in no light worthy of blame.
</p>
<p>In addition to Marjadees, there are the " Varkuts," who are considered the most
</p>
<p>zealous of the Maharaja's followers. They generally act as procurers of women for
</p>
<p>the Maharajs. Every Varkut is necessarily a pilgrim : they form a distinct caste.
</p>
<p>The first thing in my studies, which arrested my attention, was the commentary of
</p>
<p>Goculnathjee. The ten principles are explained in a Marathee book called " Kavee
</p>
<p>Charitra."
</p>
<p>(23.)  (Translation of an extract marked from a Marathi prjpated Book, page 96, entitled
</p>
<p>" Kavee Charitra" by Janardan Eamchandarji.)
</p>
<p>Afterwards, Vallabhacharya having invited his tenets with those of that System* of
</p>
<p>religious persuasion, set up a system of religious doctrines, called the Pushti-Marga. The
</p>
<p>ten articles of the principal rules thereof are as follows : 
</p>
<p>1 To secure the firm support of the Acharya (spiritual guide.)
</p>
<p>2 To worship Shri Krishna, is the only principal means of Muktif (salvation.)
</p>
<p>3 To forsake the sense of shaiue, with reference to the public opinion and the commandments of
</p>
<p>the Veds and Shastras, and to he supplicant to the Acharya for protection (or salvation.)
</p>
<p>4 Humility towards God, and the Guru. J
</p>
<p>.5 To believe, that I am not a Purush (man) hut a Gopi (female cowherd) of the Vrandavan.
</p>
<p>6 To sing (or praise) always the virtues of the Goswami.J
</p>
<p>7 To praise the greatness of the Goswami.
</p>
<p>8 To obey the commands of the Guru.
</p>
<p>9 To put faith on what GomaiJ may do or say.
</p>
<p>10 The association with and the service of the Vaishnavas.^
</p>
<p>These are the principal doctrines of the system of Vallabha. He only, who con-
</p>
<p>ducts himself agreeably to these ten commandments, is the chief worshipper (or devotee) ;
</p>
<p>and he who conducts himself according to the shastras is the treader in the regulated

<p>path. Vallabhacharya established these principles. According to those (principles) the
</p>
<p>followers of the Pushti-marga are the only principal Vaishnavas (followers of Vishnu).
</p>
<p>Besides this, there are strict words of command written in a work called the
</p>
<p>Sidhant Eahasya, to the effect that all things should be offered and presented to the
</p>
<p>Acharya, and that afterwards these things should be enjoyed.
</p>
<p>(^Sanskrit verse quoted.)
</p>
<p>The substance of this verse  By those things being offered respectively, they are
</p>
<p>transformed into the nature of Brahmajl and (thereby) five kinds of sins do not attach
</p>
<p>themselves (to persons) by the enjoyment of them.

<p>(Sansh-it verse quoted.)
</p>
<p>Goculnathji has given explicit exposition of the sin arising from not doing as des-
</p>
<p>cribed in this verse. It is as follows.
</p>
<p>(Sanskrit verse quoted.)
</p>
<p>To offer every thing means, that even our wives, sons, &c. should not be brought
</p>
<p>into our use without oftering (or presenting) them. Regarding this, there are written
</p>
<p>down other dicta and their exposition.
</p>
<p>(Sanskrit verse quoted.)
</p>
<p>The substance of this verse is, that liberty is also given to the effect that lastly
</p>
<p>those, that may be incapable of performing this difficult act, should live (in the world)
</p>
<p>by considering themselves as (the property) of the Acharya. We have thus briefly
</p>
<p>described the constitution of the S} stem of doctrines of Vallabh, and on his having gained
</p>
<p>a great number of disciples conducting themselves agreeably to his tenets, Krashnadev,
</p>
<p>Raja of Vidya Nuggar made a present to him of an image of seven maunds of gold
</p>
<p>equalling in weight his own body. With that wealth Vallabhacharya made ornaments
</p>
<p>for fthe image of Vithalnathji (and) paid off his father's debt and retained (the
</p>
<p>remainder) for (his) house* expense. He disposed of it in this way.

</p>
<p>" The Maharajs also promulgated a new set of doctrines called ' Pushti Marg.' (Mr.
</p>
<p>Anstey reads the principal doctrines of Vallubh, as illustrated by Goculnathjee) The
</p>
<p>Seedhant Rahsia is written by Vallubh, and his grandson Goculnathjee, has written a
</p>
<p>commentary on it. I had my doubts excited as to portions of the Commentary, which
</p>
<p>led me to studies and enquiries, the result of which was, that I believe that these were
</p>
<p>the real doctrines of the sect. I announced in my paper the result of my studies as soon
</p>
<p>as I had satisfied my curiosity. I was aware that the females of my sect believed the
</p>
<p>Maharajs to be incarnations of Krishna, and as the " gopees" obtained salvation by
</p>
<p>falling in love with Krishna, that our females were bent upon adulterous love towards
</p>
<p>the Maharajs. But I did not know that such doctrines were contained in any of the
</p>
<p>sacred books of the sect, until I learned the fact from personal enquiries and research.
</p>
<p>The Maharaj is known by different names, such as Agni Svaroop, Acharya, Gosaiji, Vallabhcool
</p>
<p>&c. The Maharaj pretends to be, and is believed to be the personification of God. In
</p>
<p>respect to salvation of souls the Mahai aj is superior to God, for it is said that when the

<p>Maharaj gets angry with any one, God cannot save him from the Maharaj's displea-
</p>
<p>sure ; but the Maharaj can save one from God's displeasure. To believe the Maharaj
</p>
<p>to be merely a gooroo, is to be born again in the condition of an animal or bird called
</p>
<p>' slchana.' The love enjoined to be cherished towards the Maharaj means adulterous love.
</p>
<p>These horrid opinions are held wherever members of the sect reside : they are not
</p>
<p>confined to Western India. They prevail at Benares. I caused a copy of this book to
</p>
<p>be procured from a press at Benares. I produce these papers as specimens of the attacks
</p>
<p>made upon the Maharajs previously to the publication of the alleged libel."
</p>
<p>(These specimens of attacks, which were never noticed by the Maharajs, were
</p>
<p>tendered as exhibits. Mr. Bayley objected on the ground that newspapers could not
</p>
<p>be admitted in evidence, and that, for aught he knew, those newspapers might have
</p>
<p>been printed and pubhshed by these very defendants. Objection overruled.)

</p>
<p>Witness to Court.  " These are hand-bills, newspapers, and pamphlets published from
</p>
<p>1855-59. The purport of the attacks is similar to the purport of the libel, that is,
</p>
<p>that the Maharajs are adulterers. I saw and read these different publications as they
</p>
<p>came out. I am able to say that these publications were generally circulated and
</p>
<p>read. I read and believed them to be true. To a certain extent they influenced my
</p>
<p>mind, but I was already convinced.

<p>(24.) The Bombay Times, 23rd August 1859.
</p>
<p>" The deeds of the Maharajas are evil and so they love the darkness and not
</p>
<p>the light, and have resolved to resist to the death, the inevitable exposure of the
</p>
<p>witness box, which is sure to bring on them the detestation ot the maority of the
</p>
<p>public, and must at last over-throw their influence even with their most benighted
</p>
<p>and bigoted devotees. It is not our purpose to describe their lives, their insatiable
</p>
<p>avarice, their greed of power, their insufferable pride, their grinding tyranny, and utter
</p>
<p>contempt of their people, and their abandoned profligacy ; it suffices to tell the reader
</p>
<p>that they claim to be gods and we leave them to conceive how abhorrent and infamous
</p>
<p>must be their yoke."

<p>We have (felt) much pleasure in learning and feel joy in announcing that several
</p>
<p>persons of the Hindu Community have resolved to be freed fri m the bondage of
</p>
<p>their religious preceptors, and in order to adopt a proper course for the purpose of
</p>
<p>preventing the injuries occasioned to their characters and various interests by such bondage
</p>
<p>they have come to an agreement. It is as follows :  Many of the reputable and
</p>
<p>sensible people of the Bhatia caste held a special meeting among themselves, and after having
</p>
<p>consulted together agreed as follows :  " The authority which their Maharajas exercise
</p>
<p>over them is often improper and injurious and thereby their money is unnecessarily wasted
</p>
<p>and injury is occasioned to their (reputation for) intelligence, and a blemish is attached
</p>
<p>to the honorable  so of their families." These people have consequently determined that
</p>
<p>Hindus should as far as practicable, avoid taking the opinions of the Maharajas
</p>
<p>in any matter, and should not allow females after they come of age to go to the
</p>
<p>Maharajs mansions to perform their devotions.

<p>authority of their Maharajs they will afterwards repent, even more with regard to what
</p>
<p>they now greatly suffer in respect of money, manners, and the honour of their
</p>
<p>families.

<p>(26.)  (Translation of a portion of an editorial article in the Jam-e-Jamshed ; a
</p>
<p>Gujarati Newspaper of the 25th December 1855.)
</p>
<p>" In this manner sensible and right thinking Hindus have seen their error
</p>
<p>though late, and have made fit and proper arrangements with respect to it. They
</p>
<p>have called a meeting of their own caste men and have arrived at this resolution :
</p>
<p>that in no case unconnected with matters of religion they should ask the opinion of
</p>
<p>their religious preceptors, as they on many occasions exercise over them improper
</p>
<p>authority and cause them to commit acts which reflect shame on the reputation of
</p>
<p>their families, and that after a certain hour of the day, they should not permit their
</p>
<p>faraeles to pay Darshana, (divine honors) to their religious preceptors in their temples.
</p>
<p>118
</p>
<p>Thus very often they gave to their religious preceptors with great wiUingness
</p>
<p>permission to destroy the reputation of their families, and thought it an act of holiness
</p>
<p>sufficient to carry their progeny to the seventh generation in heaven. But all this
</p>
<p>folly has spontaneously now been made public The meaning of our words is
</p>
<p>simply this : that they should be backward in respecting the notoriously immoral, the
</p>
<p>honor destroying and the unrighteous as well as improper commands of their preceptors
</p>
<p>of religion."
</p>
<p>(27.)  (Translation of a portion of an editorial article in the Samachar Durpun,
</p>
<p>a Gujrati newspaper of the 29th November 1855.)
</p>
<p>A very great discussion is going on now about the irregular conduct of the
</p>
<p>Maharajas of the Hindus, and many complaints of them are made to us. And we
</p>
<p>have received many communications too, and in them there is written something more
</p>
<p>than (what relates to) the irregular conduct of the Maharajas. Should a Maharaj not
</p>
<p>entertain the fear of God and walk in a crooked path and should he commit evil
</p>
<p>actions then it is certainly necessary to punish him ,
</p>
<p>And according as the people shall improve the acts of the Maharajs will appear to
</p>
<p>them to be oppressive. And the Hindus will not regard the Maharajs oppressive acts as
</p>
<p>God's commands in the same way as they did before. Now their knowledge holds before
</p>
<p>them a torch by the light of which they emerge from darkness into light. Therefore they
</p>
<p>will not now approve the actions ot the Maharajs and they will not behold their families
</p>
<p>corrupted. The Maharaj is not god thdt they will fear him. The Maharaj also has been
</p>
<p>made by God and they also have been made by God. They will not therefore submit any
</p>
<p>longer to the Maharajas evil actions.

<p>According as education advances in India, according as we begin to reflect upon
</p>
<p>the savage conditions (of man) our minds begin to be exceedingly expanded. The
</p>
<p>cause of (our) saying this is as follows :  With regard to the Gosawjee Maharajs of
</p>
<p>the Vaishnavs here instead of their giving instructions as spiritual preceptors, these
</p>
<p>lords practise very licentious courses towards their devotees. This when viewed by a
</p>
<p>savage does not strike him at all, but when rightly regarded it appears to be very
</p>
<p>iniquitous behavior. These Maharajas seem to these Hindus to be pure incarnations
</p>
<p>of the Deity but their actions are very base ; and their intentions are full of sin and
</p>
<p>their conduct greatly transgresses all the rules of the world, and their religious practice

<p>shortcomings.
</p>

</p>
<p>dependent) a Gujrati newspaper of the 22nd June 1859.)
</p>
<p>In regard to the various deeds done by the Hindu Maharajs and how far they
</p>
<p>act contrary to the character of religious preceptors, there were carried many general
</p>
<p>discussions which the young men have now begun to publish by means of books from
</p>
<p>which good consequences are expected to result.
</p>
<p>It is proper to know the opinion which every one has been constrained to form
</p>
<p>with regard to the Maharajas of the Vaishnavs from (perusing) the small books which
</p>
<p>have appeared such as those entitled " spiritual preceptors and families." " The
</p>
<p>authority of spiritual preceptors and licentious preceptors." The mansion of the Hindu
</p>
<p>Maharaj is a brothel, his hall is the abode of procuress (women) fallen (from virtue)
</p>
<p>without reputation, the aspect of his eyes is that of gay lasciviousness, the members
</p>
<p>119
</p>
<p>of his body are the tenements of evil passions, every particle of his person is replete
</p>
<p>with unholiness, uncleanliness, impurity, and in short instead of being as they are held
</p>
<p>to be incarnations of God, the Maharajs, have been found to be incarnations of
</p>
<p>fiends possessed of the quaUties and dispositions of demons and (of) satan.
</p>
<p>(30.)  (Translation of an extract from an Article in a Marathi newspaper called the
</p>
<p>Vritsar of the 15th August 1859.)
</p>
<p>Should a katha,* or instructions in religion, be given in the Mandirf of a Maharaj,
</p>
<p>or should a nautchj of a courtesan take place (there) ? Is it worthy of a Maharaj to give
</p>
<p>encouragement to courtesans ? Because one Maharaj has performed such an unworthy act
</p>
<p>in his own Mandir should not another Maharaj  question jj (him) ? We recommend the
</p>
<p>Vaishnav community to consider those questions. It is necessary for them to direct their
</p>
<p>attention to those questions. They should direct (their) attention to the present state of the
</p>
<p>Maharajas. They should make their Maharajas act in a proper way. The Maharajas act
</p>
<p>just as they think (proper). This should be put a stop to at once. If the Gujrati com-
</p>
<p>munity direct (their) attention in a proper manner, towards the conduct of their Maharajas
</p>
<p>their spiritual guides will conduct themselves according to their religion. Should any Maharaj
</p>
<p>not conduct himself properly, he should be turned out of his Office.
</p>
<p>(31.)  (Translation of a passage at page 13 of a printed Gujrati book entitled
</p>
<p>" A Treatise concerning Licentious Spiritual Preceptors.")
</p>
<p>In the mansions of the Maharajas there are several attendants and whippers, Sachara
</p>
<p>(Brahmans) female servants, and other people who are employed by the Maharajas to pro-
</p>
<p>cure other people's wives. Although the wives of the Maharajas are not for the most part
</p>
<p>very beautiful, yet they keep them in privacy.^ In the service of those wives there are
</p>
<p>several widows and married women. By means of such men or women appointed for those
</p>
<p>iniquitious deeds, the Maharajas send for and have brought, at the same time or later,
</p>
<p>(the females) who may have been selected from amongst those who come to perform their
</p>
<p>devotions. As for the various wanton women who are acquainted with the blandishments
</p>
<p>of love, they are called by the Maharajas winking at them. When called by a Maharaj
</p>
<p>they consider themselves called by Shri Kristna and as having attained the highest rank,
</p>
<p>and they quickly go and filled with joy, and all confused, view the Maharajs private parts
</p>
<p>and receive favors. Sometimes the sturdy fact Brahmin domestics  the attendants and the
</p>
<p>whippers dine first and cause the Maharajs to eat their leavings. And in committing these
</p>
<p><ieeds they** (the Maharajs) do not have intercourse with women suitable to their age, but
</p>
<p>bulls exert their strength upon poor tender innocent girls not of age.

<p>females go into the zenana, and the Maharajas go after them. I have seen the managers

<p>Karsandas Mooljee, cross-examined by Mr. Bay ley. "I first became acquainted with
</p>
<p>the plaintiff in the year 1860, but have never been in his company, nor even spolcen
</p>
<p>to him in my life. He has no temple in Bombay. Maharajas having no temples of
</p>
<p>their own, go to the temples belonging to other Maharajas. I have no ocular knowledge
</p>
<p>of any improprieties committed by plaintiff, but have had in respect to others, when
</p>
<p>I used to visit the temples about ten or eleven years ago. I have observed the impro-
</p>
<p>prieties of Jeewunjee, the head Maharaj. I have not been to the temples, I believe,
</p>
<p>since 1848, because I knew that the Maharaja's conduct was blame- worthy. I mean
</p>
<p>improprieties to the extent of pressing the toes of females by Jeewunjee Maharaj. I
</p>
<p>went once a week every Sunday, to Jeewunjee's temple. The temple consists of two
</p>
<p>parts, and I have seen both, I saw the toes of the females pressed three or four
</p>
<p>times when I myself went to touch the Maharaj's toes. I did not mark this
</p>
<p>when I was young, that is, under fifteen. This circumstance, combined with their
</p>
<p>general reputation as regards adultery, made me secede from the Maharajas. Jeewunjee
</p>
<p>is still my gooroo, but I have stopped visiting him. I have a daughter round whose
</p>
<p>neck I put a " kanthee" myself according to the ceremonial forms of my sect. Many
</p>
<p>Vaishnas have put " kanthees" with their own hands round the necks of their
</p>
<p>children. There may be two hundred reformers among the Vaishnas at the utmost.
</p>
<p>When I say all the Maharajas have carnal intercourse with the daughters and wives
</p>
<p>of their devotees, and that maidens are first sent to the Maharajas after their mar-
</p>
<p>riage, I say so from general reputation. Besides pi-essing the toes, I have seen the
</p>
<p>Maharajs throwing golal on the breasts of females during the Holee festival in different
</p>
<p>years, when all the men and women were in the temple. It was golal which had
</p>
<p>been offered to the idol, and is considered holy by the people. The golal was some-
</p>
<p>times thrown in balls, which where pointedly thrown at the breasts of females. I
</p>
<p>received spiritual instruction from the Maharaj once in my life when the " kanthee"
</p>
<p>was put round my neck. These sacred books are the property of two of my friends
</p>
<p>and of Eamlall Thackorseydas. I found out the particular passages with the assistance
</p>
<p>of one Mathooradassdas. I was acquainted with these passages before the time of the
</p>
<p>alleged libel. I said there are about a hundred sects in India, but I don't think the
</p>
<p>old religion is represented by any one sect at present. Some of the sects follow the
</p>
<p>old religion more or less. The Vallabhacharya sect professes to follow the old reli-
</p>
<p>gion, but I am not certain whether it does. It differs widely in its doctrines from
</p>
<p>those of the old religion, and conceives itself to be far superior to all other sects.

</p>
<p>The number of the Vallabhacharyas in Bombay may be thirty or forty thousand ; they
</p>
<p>extend from here to the Ganges and to Agra, but not uninterruptedly. I heard six or
</p>
<p>seven years ago that the Maharajs were excommunicated by the Telinga Brahmins.
</p>
<p>I think it is the general belief in the sect that Vallabh was a Telinga Brahmin and
</p>
<p>was outcasted. Telinga is a province in the Madras Presidency. The Telinga Brah-
</p>
<p>mins form a large body in Telinga as in other parts of India, and are the worshippers
</p>
<p>of Shiva. They are like any other Brahmins in any other part of India. The
</p>
<p>Vaishanavs and the Shivas are " at daggers drawn." Luxmon Bhatt, the father of
</p>
<p>Vallabh, was excommunicated by his own castemen for founding a new creed. Menu
</p>
<p>and other books are considered to be of divine origin. The story of the " gopees"
</p>
<p>and the incarnations of Vishnoo are believed in by several sects, but are opposed to
</p>
<p>the ancient religion. The Shaivites believe in the incarnations of Vishnoo equally with
</p>
<p>IG
</p>
<p>122
</p>
<p>the Vaishanavs. As far as I have read, all the sacred books do not contain amorous
</p>
<p>passages. I am not aware whe'^^r Sir William Jones has said that " Krishna is to
</p>
<p>this day the darling god of Hindu women." I have heard the story of Brahma coming
</p>
<p>out of an egg after remaining three millions and millions of years. I do not believe in the
</p>
<p>modern stories in books vvrhich are vsrritten after the Veds, which I have not read. The stories
</p>
<p>are considered by most Vaishanavs as literally true. I was not present at any of the " Ras festi-
</p>
<p>vals ;" it is a matter of general reputation, and is described by Captain McMurdo of Kutch,
</p>
<p>in his work, on that province. Adultery is considered a crime whether committed by a " Go-
</p>
<p>sai," or any other person. The instruction which Vaishnavs receive from the Maharaj is
</p>
<p>only once in their life-time when the " kanthee" is put round the neck. In certain res-
</p>
<p>pects the Maharajs are regarded as religious preceptors, but they don't teach more than
</p>
<p>once in a person's life-time. Each family has its priest, who gives instruction in religion.
</p>
<p>The plaii.affis not a Brahmin of high caste ; he is an outcasted Brahmin, and no high-caste
</p>
<p>Brahmin would dine with him or the other Maharajs under the penalty of being ex-communicated.
</p>
<p>I collected and printed the licentious songs sung by females when the Maharajs are invited to their
</p>
<p>houses. I have heard the songs sung within the last year or two. I heard them sung.
</p>
<p>They are sung generally among the sect. What I printed are not the exact words, but
</p>
<p>the substance of the songs, which I got printed for the purposes of this trial. There are
</p>
<p>many other songs of similar tendency ; these are mere specimens. The Brahmins are
</p>
<p>highly respected ; they are not divine. The " amorous Kann" plainly means the jMaharaj ;
</p>
<p>he is generally regarded as God, the Supreme Being himself It is not possible that I can
</p>
<p>be mistaken as to the construction of the words " tun, mun, and dkun." " Dhun" means
</p>
<p>property, but the Vaishnavs have extended the sense. I differ with the Chief Ti-anslator
</p>
<p>as to the translation of the latter portion of the libel. The word " bigado cho" simply
</p>
<p>means " defile," but from the context it is a participle and not an active verb. I had
</p>
<p>nothing to do with the article which appeared in the Summackar : its editor was a Parsee. I
</p>
<p>had nothing to do with any of the articles which appeared in other journals against the
</p>
<p>Maharajs. I don't know who wrote the article against the Maharajs in the Bombay
</p>
<p>Times. I have seen Maharajs follow females into their private rooms,  not the females of
</p>
<p>their own family, who are not allowed to be seen by strangers. Plaintiff pretended for
</p>
<p>some time to be a reformer. I have not read Goculnathjee's commentary in the original,
</p>
<p>i. e. the Sanskrit. I did not intend to convey any reflections against the plaintiff, but
</p>
<p>against the body of Maharajs. I have had no personal knowledge of the adulteries of
</p>
<p>plaintiff : it was a matter of notoriety that he committed a rape at Surat. I heard from

<p>a friend that plaintiff suffered last year from the venereal disease.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley.  Who is your friend ?
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey applied that the witness might not be compelled to give up the name, as,
</p>
<p>from the fact of so many " bundobusts" having been made against the defendant by order
</p>
<p>of the Maharaj, it was to be presumed that if the name were revealed, the witness would
</p>
<p>be exposed to importunities and menaces, and thus justice would be defeated.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley objected on the ground that he had a very good reason for asking the
</p>
<p>name, and that the Court cannot extend the rules of evidence in defendant's favour.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey repeated that justice would be defeated if the name were given up, and
</p>
<p>ibegged the Court, in the exercise of its discretion, to obviate the mischief by a special
</p>
<p>.123
</p>
<p>order in this case, which, he maintained, had no parallel in the constitutional history of
</p>
<p>England ; and the special order might well be made.
</p>
<p>The Court decided that to obviate inconvenience to the defendant, the name of the
</p>
<p>party who had a personal knowledge of the fact, must iiot be exposed ; but that the
</p>
<p>name of the friend who conveyed the information to defendant, might be given without
</p>
<p>much inconvenience.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley.  Who is your friend that informed you ?
</p>
<p>Witness to Court.  " Am I bound to answer that question, my Lords '<
</p>
<p>Sir Mr. Sausse.  Yes, answer it.
</p>
<p>Witness continued.  " Lukmidas Khimjee is the name of the friend. I know nothing
</p>
<p>of this, of my personal knowledge.
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  The females go to the zenana, the place for the Maharaj's
</p>
<p>family. They go to th zenana, and then into the Maharaj's bedroom. The zenana has
</p>
<p>more than one rooni ; but I don't know of my persor.al knowledge. At the time I wrote
</p>
<p>the article, I believed that the Maharajs did defile their female devotees.
</p>
<p>Ee-exammed by Mr. Anstcj.  " None of the sects does in itself represent the ancient
</p>
<p>Hindu religion. The adulteries of the Maharajs are a matter of notoriety. Captain
</p>
<p>McMurdo has written on their adulteries and on the " Eas festival," in the volume 2nd
</p>
<p>of the " Transactions of the Literary Society of Bombay," published in the year 1820,
</p>
<p>He says : 
</p>
<p>" The Bhattias are of Sindh origin. They are the most numerous end wealthy
</p>
<p>' merchants in the country, and worship the Gossengjee Maharaj, of whom there are many.
</p>
<p>' The Maharaj is master of their property and disposes of it as h pieases ; and sucli is
</p>
<p>' the veneration in which he is held, that the most respectable families consider themselves
</p>
<p>* honoured by his cohabiting with their wives or daughters. The principal Maharaj at pre-
</p>
<p>' sent on this side of India is named Gopinathjee, a man worn to a skelton and shaking
</p>
<p>' like a leaf from debauchery of every kind, excepting spirituous liquors. He is constantly
</p>
<p>' in a staic of intoxication from opium, and various other stimulants which the ingenuity of
</p>
<p>' the sensual has discovered. He is originally a Brahmin. . . . The well-known Eus
</p>
<p>' MundUees are very frequent among them (the Bhattias) as among other followers of
</p>
<p>' Vishnoo. At these, persons of both sexes and all descriptions, high and low, meet together,
</p>
<p>' and, under the name and sanction .f religion, practise every kind of licentiousness.'
</p>
<p>(Witness here '^ofmes the grammatical construction of the passage containing the libel, 
</p>
<p>* You Maharajs !' &c.) I am sure that the songs I ' e printed give exactly the

<p>(2.)  Dr. John Wilson, examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I am an ordained minister of the Free
</p>
<p>Church of Scotland, and a graduate of the University of Edinburgh. I came out to this
</p>
<p>country in 1829. My professional duties as a missionary led me to the study of some
</p>
<p>of the eastern languages : I know the Sanskrit, the Zend, and to a certain extent the
</p>
<p>P ehlvi. I have some acquaintaince with the Prakrit languages and the Brig Bhasha, in
</p>
<p>b3 th its forms, I have presided at the examinations in languages of gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>Services. I was offered the office of Translator to Government, but declined it. I am a
</p>
<p>m ember of the Koyal Society of Great Britain and Ireland, and a member of the Bombay
</p>
<p>Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. For seven years I was its president, and since 1842
</p>
<p>have been its honorary president. I am a corresponding member of several Societies in
</p>
<p>Europe. I am the author of certain works of the ancient Hindu religious systems, and
</p>
<p>have prosecij^ted studies in the literature of the East. I commenced such of my studies in
</p>
<p>the University of Edinburgh, and prosecuted them on my arrival in this country. I have
</p>
<p>heard the evidence of the witnesses in this case up to yesterday ; but I was absent
</p>
<p>yesterday. There is one sacred book of the Hindus called the Vishnoo Puran, a philoso-
</p>
<p>phical and legendary treatise dedicated to the exposition of views respecting Vishnoo. I
</p>
<p>have read it in the original Sanscrit as well as translations of it. The most ancient books
</p>
<p>of the Hindus are the Veds. They are what is called " Srootee," i. <'., what is heard. They
</p>
<p>are believed to be the works of divine revelation in the highest sense of the word. The
</p>
<p>Vishnoo Puran belongs to a later period and is considered as authoritative revelation by a
</p>
<p>large body of the Hindus. The Institutes of Menu are believed to have been written two
</p>
<p>centuries before the Christian era ; the Veds about three thousand years before the
</p>
<p>Christian era. The law books belong to the " Smriti," /. e., what is recollected. The
</p>
<p>literature of the Hindus shows great changes of religious belief and practice. It is an
</p>
<p>historical fact, that the more modern religions are less moral and less pure. Very great
</p>
<p>changes have occurred in India with reference to the gods, positively for the worse, as
</p>
<p>admitted by the Hindus themselves. Vallabhacharya flourished from the end of the 15th
</p>
<p>to the beginning of the 16th century. I have read that Vallabh visited the King of
</p>
<p>Vizianuggur about the year 1500 or 1504, and I found from the genealogies of the kings
</p>
<p>of that place, that the King was Krishna Deva ; and that Vallabh received a large pre-
</p>
<p>sent of gold from him. (Witness refers to an ancient Sanscrit drama he held in his hand.)
</p>
<p>The dramatist distinctly alludes to the existence of the sect of Vallabhacharyas. (Witness
</p>
<p>was about to refer to the contents of the drama, to which Mr. Bayley objected.)

<p>Witness to Sir M. Sausse.  " I have not found any reference to the drama in the
</p>
<p>s acred books of the sect. I don't now if it has ever been acted ; but it is the custom of
</p>
<p>the Brahmins to compose dramas and circulate them among their friends.
</p>
<p>The Court upheld the objection, on the ground that the drama was not a professional
</p>
<p>treatise, and could not be recognised as an historical authority as to the tenets of the sect.
</p>
<p>Witness continued.  " My object in referring to the drama was to show the existence
</p>
<p>of the sect and its aspects to certain classes of India.
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse.  The aspects of the sect to other classes are not pertinent to the
</p>
<p>matter at issue.
</p>
<p>125
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey asked the Court to take a note of his argument, that the witness could
</p>
<p>not be prevented from referring to the document. (Note taken accordingly.)
</p>
<p>Witness proceeded to say.  " I have seen notices of the sect by Captain McMurdo^
</p>
<p>Kesident at Kutch, in papers communicated to the Asiatic Society of Bombay ; and in the
</p>
<p>16th volume of the Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, in which the origin and
</p>
<p>doctrines of the sect are set forth by Dr. Horace Hayraan Wilson, for some time the
</p>
<p>ecretary of the Society.
</p>
<p> Amongst other articles of the new creed, Vallabha introduced one, which is rather
</p>
<p>singular for a Hindu religious innovator or reformer : he taught, that privation formed no
</p>
<p>part ot sanctity, and that it was the duty of the teachers and his disciples to worship
</p>
<p>their deity, not in nudity and hunger, but in costly apparel and choice food, not in soli-
</p>
<p>tude and mortification, but in the pleasures of society and the enjoyment of the world.
</p>
<p>The Gosains or teachers, are almost always family men, as was the founder Vallabha, for
</p>
<p>after he had taken off the restrictions of the monastic order to which he originally belong-
</p>
<p>ed, he married, by the particular order, it is said, of his new god. The Gosains are
</p>
<p>always clothed with the best raiment, and fed with the daintiest viands by their followers,
</p>
<p>over whom they have unlimited influence : part of the connection between the Guru and
</p>
<p>teacher, being the three-fold Samarpan or consignment of Tan, Man and Dhan, body,
</p>
<p>mind and wealth, to the spiritual guide.
</p>
<p>**** -X- *
</p>
<p>' The most celebrated of all the Gosain establishments is at Shri Nath Dwar in
</p>
<p>Ajmer. The image at this shrine is said to have transported itself thither from .Mathura
</p>
<p>when Aurangzeb ordered the temple it was there placed in to be destroyed. The present
</p>
<p>shrine is modern, but richly endowed, and the high priest a descent of Gokulnath, is a
</p>
<p>man of great wealth and importance. It is a matter of obligation with the members of
</p>
<p>this seet to visit Shri Naih Dicar, at least once in their lives ; they receive there a
</p>
<p>certificate to that effect, issued by the head Gosain and in return, contribute accord-
</p>
<p>ing to their means to the enriching of the establishment.
</p>
<p>' It is not an uncurious feature in the notions of this sect, that all the veneration paid
</p>
<p>to their Gosains is paid solely to their descent, and unconnected with any idea of their
</p>
<p>sanctity or learning ; they are not unfrequently destitute of all pretensions to individual
</p>
<p>respectability, bnt they iiot the- less enjoy the homage of their followers.'
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  " From my study of the doctrines of the sect I am of opinion with
</p>
<p>with Dr. Hayman Wilson that the sect is impure. I agree with what Dr. Hayman

</p>
<p>Wilson states. (Witness reads the parts in which he agrees with Dr. H. H. Wilson.)
</p>
<p>Vallabh taught that the Deity should be worshipped in choice food and costly apparel, not
</p>
<p>in solitude but in the enjoyment of society. The Gossavis have unlimited influence over
</p>
<p>their followers, who consign to them their " tun, mun, and dhun." (An account is next
</p>
<p>given of the services of the image, in which witness agreed with Dr. H. H. Wilson.) The
</p>
<p>homage paid to the Gossavis is paid to their descent, not their sanctity or individual accom-
</p>
<p>plishments. The most ignorant Gossai is reverenced by his followers.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Anstey.  '"The drama I have referred to, is a faithful mirror of the doctrines
</p>
<p>and practices of the sect as they prevail at the present day. I could not give a more
</p>
<p>faithful picture, than by reading one of the passages which I have translated into English.
</p>
<p>The conductor of the play says to one of the actors : 
</p>
<p>" The Veds have fled ; lovely damsels now look to the gratification of sense with the
</p>
<p>' descendants of Vallabh ; the descendant of Vallabh is the kisser of females ; he feels
</p>
<p>' lust at every step for his large-eyed damsels. Offering one's-sclf and one's wives and
</p>
<p>126
</p>
<p>' daughters to the gooroos is in this world the only course of salvation. Carnal intercourse
</p>
<p> with females, dining and playing with them, is one of the principal offices of Krishna. The
</p>
<p>' nectarine pleasure of Shree Gocul (Krishna) is better than a thousand other expedients.
</p>
<p>' If copulation does not take place with Krishna, the existence of the paramour of man is
</p>
<p>* worse than that of a worm.' (The passage, of which the above is the substance, is put
</p>
<p>* on the record.)
</p>
<p>The sect of the Vallabhacharyas is a new sect, inasmuch as it has selected Krishna
</p>
<p>in the aspect of his adolescence and praised him to supremacy in that aspect. The sect
</p>
<p>is new in its objects and new in its method. The god Krishna is worshipped in the
</p>
<p>shape of images and the Maharajs ; both are believed to be personifications of Krishna.
</p>
<p>The Maharaj is considered as an incarnation of God ; he is God incarnate according to
</p>
<p>Hindu notions, which are peculiar in this respect. There have occurred nine incarnations
</p>
<p>of Vishnoo, the last of which was that of Boodh The Hindus do not believe in any
</p>
<p>incarnations which have taken place between the time of Boodh and the present day ;
</p>
<p>the Vallabhacharyas, on the contrary, hold that Vallabh and his descendants are incarna-
</p>
<p>tions of Krishna. They view the Maharajs as intermediate between themselves and the
</p>
<p>God Krishna ; in the sense of receiving his dicta as equal to Krishna himself. As
</p>
<p>between the angry God and the sectary, the Maharaj is the mediator ; as bet
</p>
<p>ween the Maharaj and the sectary there is no mediator. There are multitudes who
</p>
<p>believe the Maharajs not only as gooroos, but also in the light above represented.
</p>
<p>The Maharajs are certainly not the preceptors of what is technically denominated the
</p>
<p>Hindu religion. They are not chiefs or heads of any single sect of Brahmins. The
</p>
<p>descendants of Vallabh are considerered as outcasted Telinga Brahmins. To my
</p>
<p>knowledge there is no intercourse between the Maharjs and the Telinga Brahmins.
</p>
<p>According to the belief and practices of the Hindu religion, it is not possible for Brahmins
</p>
<p>to hold such intercourse with the Maharajs as members of one caste hold with each other.
</p>
<p> Tun, mun, and dhun' are used in an all-comprehensive sense : ' tun' embracing body in
</p>
<p>all its relations ; and ' mun' referring to mind in all its mental faculties and qualities which
</p>
<p>are to be placed at the disposal of the Maharaj according to the doctrines of the sect.
</p>
<p>With reference to the third word ' dhun,' I have seen passages published by the authority
</p>
<p>of the Maharajs, in which it is stated that the sectaries should make over to the Maharaj
</p>
<p>their sons, wives, daughters, and every thing else before applying these things to their own
</p>
<p>use. (Witness reads the translation of a passage from the commentary of Goculnathjee).
</p>
<p>In regard to the Brahmin, it is said in the Bhugwut Gita that his qualities are quiescence,

</p>
<p>self-control, patience, rectitude, the resignation of spiritual existence, &c. The sense of
</p>
<p>shame and public opinion are outraged by the doctrines of the Vallabhacharyas. There is
</p>
<p>no sense of shame in the doctrines of the sect. I have heard that the translation of the
</p>
<p>passage containing the alleged libel has been disputed. I consider that the passage
</p>
<p>should be read as :  ' Ye Maharajas ! when you act according to that commentary, or
</p>
<p>upon your acting according to your commentary, you corrupt the wives and daughters of
</p>
<p>your devotees, lift your hand' (desist.) The passage is capable of the interpretation
</p>
<p>given by the defendant. The meaning to my mind, is that it is a mild expostulation
</p>
<p>on the principle. I do not think that, in the passage, the plaintiff and other Maharajs
</p>
<p>are necessarily meant ; it is probably a general and inferential proposition. (Witness
</p>
<p>reads the translation by himself of a Sanscrit paper, in which a sectary says to
</p>
<p>Krishna :  " I consecrate to thee, my life, my soul, my organs, my property, myself,
</p>
<p>&c. I am thy slave, Oh Kiishna !")
</p>
<p>127
</p>
<p>Translation of the original Sanscrit Text.
</p>
<p>Shri Krishna is my protector I
</p>
<p>Om,* I, who am eternally destroyed by misery and pain produced by (my) separation
</p>
<p>from Krishna, during a time measured by thousands of years, do surrender to the allf

</p>
<p>its feelings, as also (my) wife, house, children, relatives, weath, and other wordly things,
</p>
<p>together with (my) soul. Oh you Krishna, I am your servant.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bayley.  " The passage containing the alleged libel is
</p>
<p>ambiguous, and the composition is losse. I think the Bhattias, who read it, would see
</p>
<p>the connection between it and the commentary. I am not prepared to state that Mr.
</p>
<p>Flynn's translation is incorrect, but it might be improved. I have taken no active part
</p>
<p>in the getting up of the case, except that I take an interest in it, I did not know the
</p>
<p>defendant personally before the action was brought. I have not been in any of the
</p>
<p>Maharaj's temples. I have no personal knowledge of the improper practices of the
</p>
<p>Maharajs, but have heard a good deal from his followers. From the books I conclude
</p>
<p>that the Maharaj and the idol are worshipped as gods. I do not think that the Hindus
</p>
<p>worship cows and bulls ; they believe that the Deity is present every where and in every-
</p>
<p>thing, and, philosophically, they believe every thing to emanate from the Godhead. The
</p>
<p>books of Vallabhacharya are read by portions of the sect. Sir William Jones thought that
</p>
<p>the time of Menu was about the date of Christ.
</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  " I would not call the Mormonites a sect of Christians. The
</p>
<p>Vallabhacharya sect forms only a portion of the Hindu religion.
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  "I cannot say that any sect at present strictly follows the ancient
</p>
<p>Hindu rehgion.
</p>
<p>Witness proceeded to say.  "I know of a sect that holds doctrines similar to those of
</p>
<p>the Vallabhacharya sect. This book (one of the exhibits) appears to me to have been
</p>
<p>published by order of one of the Maharajs. There is no date to it ; I have come across
</p>
<p>it in my researches. It appears to have been printed and circulated in Bombay, but I
</p>
<p>cannot say to what extent. The word ' vishai' is not equivalent to the word adultery.
</p>
<p>The caste to which the Maharajs should belong is the Telinga Brahmin. The third or
</p>
<p>fourth in descent of the Vallabhacharya sect, I believe, is still alive in Ahmedahad, but I
</p>
<p>have not seen him personally. There are a number of sects in various parts of India of
</p>
<p>as recent origin as the Vallabhacharya sect. The words ' tun, mun, and dhun' have
</p>
<p>nothing peculiar in their original meaning, which has been extended by the Maharajs.

<p>The intelligent portion of. the Hindu community are making great researches in their old
</p>
<p>writings. 'I have read some of the works of the plaintiff and formed a very low estimate
</p>
<p>of them.
</p>
<p>Re-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I have seen some very obscene conduct on the part
</p>
<p>of the Maharajs, and have turned away -from it in disgust. I should have been pleased
</p>
<p>to have seen a better state of things in this country. The passages in question were
</p>
<p>* Om is a mystic term used at the beginning of all religious formulas as -well as invocations, prayers, Ac.

<p>t All refers to powers, gualilies and things : fdl-furnithed is an epithet commonly given to the deity.

<p>128
</p>
<p>brought to my notice by parties engaged in the defence, but I was acquainted with them
</p>
<p>before.
</p>
<p>To the Court.  " The meaning of the words " ras lila" is amorous sport ; the meaning
</p>
<p>of " ras" alone might be rendered as the " juices of fruit or of the body." The Maharajs
</p>
<p>in a general point of view might be looked upon as preceptors, but not as preceptors of
</p>
<p>the Hindu religion."
</p>
<p>Eleventh Day, Monday, Wth February, 1862.
</p>
<p>(3.)  Balajee Pandoorang, examined by Mr. Dunbar.  " I am one of the Translators
</p>
<p>ajid Interpreters of this Court. I have rendered into English this passage (in exhibit) in
</p>
<p>the Brig Bhasha. (Witness deposes to having translated into English several other passages
</p>
<p>referred to and put in as exhibits.)
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Scoble.  " There is a dictionary of the Brig Bhasha language,
</p>
<p>printed at the Calcutta School-book Society's Press, for the use of schools, to which I
</p>
<p>referred for the meaning of some words. The Brig Bhasha is a composite language
</p>
<p>containing some Sanscrit and some Hindu words, and some no doubt other dialects. In
</p>
<p>making the translations, I looked more to the meaning of the analogous than to the mean-
</p>
<p>ing of the words themselves. I have never scientifically studied the Brig Bhasha language
</p>
<p>as a language. I have read some songs in Brig Bhasha. In the translations I confined
</p>
<p>myself to the passages I had to translate. ' Russic She'romanee' literally means * the
</p>
<p>head jewel of humour :' the words mean either intellectual, aesthetic, or sensual pleasure.
</p>
<p>" Vehvichar bhav" means adulterine, not adoptive, love ; the first word literally means
</p>
<p>admixture, confusion. The words are always used in a bad sense ; they cannot be
</p>
<p>translated as ' exceptional or deviating love.' ' Soorut Aranya' means a forest where
</p>
<p>sport is carried on between men and women ; the first word does not mean beauty.
</p>
<p>Re-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I have carefully studied the passages I have translated,
</p>
<p>and have no doubt as to the meanings I have given. ' Vehvichar,' in its primary sense,
</p>
<p>means admixture ; and in its secondary sense, adultery."
</p>
<p>(4.)  Venayeck Laxman Shastree, examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I am a Brahmin,
</p>
<p>and Government Shastree at the Sudder Adawlut, I come from the Concun. The report
</p>
<p>is that the Maharajs are Brahmins, and I consider them as Brahmins. I might sit with
</p>
<p>them, but would not dine with them. I cannot give the reason, but that has been the
</p>
<p>practice for several years, probably from their having connectioxi with the Gujeratee people.
</p>
<p>They have a good number of followers, but they are not the chiefs or heads of any persons
</p>
<p>but the Vallabhacharyas. I know the Sanskrit language, and have seen and read some of

</p>
<p>the sacred books. All religious sects of the Hindus are derived from the ancient religion,
</p>
<p>and profess to be guided by its principles and cannot therefore be said to differ from the
</p>
<p>ancient religion. Each sect says that it follows the ancient religion. I don't think that the
</p>
<p>Vallabhacharya sect deviates from the ancient religion ; but there may be some slight
</p>
<p>difference. It is a sin almost equal to adultery for a person to handle the breast of
</p>
<p>another's wife :"
</p>
<p>129
</p>
<p>The witness was not cross-examined for the plaintiff.
</p>
<p>(o.)  Vishvanath Narayan, examined by Mr. Dunl.ar.  " I am Superintendent of
</p>
<p>the Special Income Tax Commissioner's Office and a member of the Bombay Branch of
</p>
<p>the Koyal Asiatic Society. I hold the substantive appointment of Curator of the
</p>
<p>Government Central Book Depot and Deputy Inspector of Marathee Schools. I have
</p>
<p>translated Elphinstone's History of India into Marathee. I am one of the Konkanee Brahmins,
</p>
<p>and am acquainted with b'anscrit. I have read some of the ancient books of the
</p>
<p>Hindus. We have no intercourse with the Maharajas as Brahmins ; we don't intermarry
</p>
<p>or dine with them ; because, as Brahmins, we have duties to perform, and to my
</p>
<p>knowledge the Maharajas don't perform those duties. They are not preceptors of religion
</p>
<p>to all Hindus. I am not acquainted with their caste as Brahmins. Every Brahmin,
</p>
<p>according to our laws as laid down in Menu, has to perform six duties :  sacrificing
</p>
<p>and assisting at sacrifices ; teaching the Veds, which the Maharajas don't teach to my
</p>
<p>knowledge, &c. These are two out of the principal six which are neglected by the
</p>
<p>Maharajas. I have looked at some of the books ot the Vallabhacharya sect. (Witness
</p>
<p>refers to passages in some of the exhibits.) The Maharaj is in this passage described
</p>
<p>as the lord, the husband of many women ; as one whose only object is wanton sport
</p>
<p>with many women and the ocean of wanton sport with many women. One of the
</p>
<p>books contains 108 names for the Maharaj, and he is described, there as equal
</p>
<p>to the Supreme Being. I don't think that the Vallabhacharya sect follows the religion
</p>
<p>of Menu, the most ancient religion of the Hindus. My caste, are bound to follow
</p>
<p>that religion, and they follow it. I don't think the Brahmins regard the Maharajas
</p>
<p>as models of morality at all. They have no authority in the Brahmin caste at all, so
</p>
<p>far as my caste is concerned. The morality of the Maharajas was made the subject of
</p>
<p>comment in some of the Marathee newspapers of Bombay. To my knowledge the chastity
</p>
<p>and morality of the Maharajas are very low. Others have also a low opinion of them.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bay ley.  " I have seen the plaintiff once at his house in
</p>
<p>Bombay. I may have seen other Maharajas on the roads. Once in Bombay, in the year
</p>
<p>1858-59, I saw a Maharaj do an improper act, unworthy of his assumed character of a
</p>
<p>spiritual preceptor. There were two persons sitting in a moveable swing among a crowd
</p>
<p>of males and females, and the Maharajas (I think both of them were Maharajas) threw
</p>
<p>golal indiscriminately upon all. The golal is not thrown only during the Holee holidays.
</p>
<p>I do not recognise the Bombay Almanac as a book of religious authority. I considered it
</p>
<p>an act of immorality for men and women to mix together purposely, and for the Maharajas

</p>
<p>to throw golal upon the females. It was not an accidental crowd : the men and women
</p>
<p>met purposely on the occasion. I consider the book of Menu as binding so far as it is
</p>
<p>consonant with the Veds. I have been in Sind, out of the Bombay Presidency, and in
</p>
<p>Kattiawar and Gujerat. Gossaijee and Maharaj are considered as convertible terms.
</p>
<p>Gossai commonly means a man clad in reddish-coloured clothes. A preceptor of religion
</p>
<p>must be a Brahmin ; and I cannot say if the Maharajas are preceptors of religion. I have
</p>
<p>not heard that the Koncanee Brahmins are looked down upon by the Gujeratee Brahmins.
</p>
<p>The fact is the other way. We dine with the Telinga Brahmins, but not with the Maharajas,
</p>
<p>I have read the whole of Goculnathjee's commentary in the Sanscrit. I don't recollect
</p>
<p>any particular passage ; I recollect the general impression it left upon my mind. The
</p>
<p>translation of the passage in the alleged libel from the commentary, is not so exact
</p>
<p>as mine, but I cannot say that it is a garbled translation. There is no mention of
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>the Maharaja's name in the original : The original passage is in the passive voice, but
</p>
<p>the agent is understood. The word " Soorut" in Sanscrit implies carnal intercourse. I
</p>
<p>know Gujeratee. The word " Soorut" means a face, countenance, in the Hindoostanee.
</p>
<p>It would have the same meaning in Gujeratee according to the context. I know the
</p>
<p>defendant for the last two or three years and have taken an interest in the case as
</p>
<p>one of the public only.
</p>
<p>Re-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " The proper meaning of the word " reform" is
</p>
<p>bettering, and in that sense I am a reformer, and wish to see the religion restored
</p>
<p>to its pristine purity. I have heard the Maharaj called " Purshotum," i. e., best of
</p>
<p>beings. This word in the commentary applies to the Maharaj. Goculnathjee's com-
</p>
<p>mentary is considered a book of religion. (The Marathee translation of the commentary
</p>
<p>is put into witness's hand.) I find a passage in the book referring to " Acharya,"
</p>
<p>commanding that all things should be in the first instance offered to him before being
</p>
<p>tasted or enjoyed by any other person. From what I have seen and heard, I don't
</p>
<p>think the plaintiff and other Maharajas specially qualified to be spiritual preceptors.
</p>
<p>From the conversation I had with the plaintiff, I did not think he was a man of
</p>
<p>learning, and as such, qualified to be a preceptor. I take no interest in this ease
</p>
<p>beyond what is felt in it by hundreds of the public. (Eefers again to a passage in
</p>
<p>the commentary.). The subject of my conversation with the plaintiff, was the female
</p>
<p>schools and the meaning of one or two verses from the " Bhagwut Gita."
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  " Every Brahmin is bound to be a preceptor ; if he is not
</p>
<p>80 qualified, he is obliged to undergo a certain penance. Among the general class of
</p>
<p>Hindus, every Brahmin is looked upon as a preceptor, whether he gives precepts or not."
</p>

<p>dates. In this instance I have collated two manuscripts and the dates each bore were
</p>
<p>different. These books are read by Banias who read the Balbodh character. I have
</p>
<p>read portions of them. I am a " Kyast," a word derived from Kya," the body. The
</p>
<p>Kyasts are followers of the Maharajas. They are respected by their followers and such
</p>
<p>Brahmins as receive alms from the Maharajas.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Anstey.  I find one of the books composed by Vallabhacharya. The
</p>
<p>Maharajas are reputed to be outcaste Telinga Brahmins. A Brahmin out of caste
</p>
<p>would not be reputed to be a preceptor of religion among learned Brahmins. I don't
</p>
<p>131
</p>
<p>know what common Brahmins might think. There are some Brahmin followers of the

<p>Maharajas."
</p>
<p>(8.)  Narayeii Dinanathjee, examined by Mr. Dumbar.  " I am one of the
</p>
<p>Translators and Interpreters of this Court, and remember to have translated some of
</p>
<p>the documents in this case, (specifies them.)
</p>
<p>Witness to Mr. Bayley.  I did not read the books before they were put into my
</p>
<p>hand for translation. I visit one Maharaj Jeevunjpe, as a friend ; he is considered the
</p>
<p>head man. I have visted his temple perhaps two or three times a year, during the last
</p>
<p>ten or twelve years, I have not seen any improprieties in his temple. I have not
</p>
<p>been there during the Holee, and have not seen any golal thrown. There are certain
</p>
<p>occasions on which golal is thrown ; the Holee is one of them. There is no impropriety
</p>
<p>in the act itself. I have not seen Jeevunjee throw any golal at dl at any time. I
</p>
<p>never went there to see the idol or the worshippers. Gooroos are worsliipped by all
</p>
<p>sects throughout India ; and all sects have gooioos. The form of worship is always the
</p>
<p>same : they are not worshipped as gods. There are in my caste both Vaishnavs and
</p>
<p>Shivites ; but none of them are followers of the Maharajas. I have read the commentary
</p>
<p>of Goculnathjee since this action was filed. My attention was particularly called to the
</p>
<p>word " Purshotum" therein, and I remarked that it applied to Purshotum (God) alone.
</p>
<p>The word Acharya (gooroo) occurs in one place. And it is stated that the dedication
</p>
<p>ought to be made to Purshotum through the Acharya. It is very difficult to say
</p>
<p>what the word " Soorut" means : it means  " soo," good ; and " rut," attached. I am
</p>
<p>not positive, I guess merely. I am not prepared to say whether or not it means
</p>
<p>carnal intercourse. As to the name of the town, Surat, it means " Surat," good
</p>
<p>town. According to my views there is nothing improper in the dedication of " tun,
</p>
<p>mun, and dhun" (to God). It is enjoined in all sects. As to the ' Eas lila' I would
</p>
<p>derive the word from " ras," an assemblage ; not " rus," juice. The word
</p>
<p>" Kas," however, is capable of the interpretation of juice. I never heard of the " Eaa
</p>
<p>festival." The popular meaning of " Vyabhichar" is adultery ; the primary meaning is a
</p>
<p>deviation. " Achar" means practice, and is a component part of Acharya (spiritual guide)
</p>
<p>which latter means a practiser, " Shankaracharya" is the gooroo of the Shivites. I have
</p>
<p>not looked carefully at the passage containing the alleged libel. (Looks at it now.) I
</p>
<p>would read it thus :  " Acting according to that commentary, or having acted according to
</p>
<p>it, you (Maharajas) defile the wives and daughters of your devotees " There is not the
</p>
<p>slightest doubt that the passage says ; " You are defiling" that is the literal translation.

</p>
<p>The following words are " take off your hands from it," that is, from the defiling, &c. I
</p>
<p>have not the slightest doubt that this is the meaning which a person reading newspapers
</p>
<p>would attach to the passage. The " Bhagwut Gita" is a book of very high authority, on
</p>
<p>which witnesses are sworn, and is an extract from the Mahabharut, 1 have heard the
</p>
<p>story of Krishna and his 16,000 wives, Vaishnavs of all sects regard him as a Hindoo
</p>
<p>god ; his incarnations are believed in by all Hindoos.

<p>Mr. Bayley.  I have several My Lord.

<p>Tioelfth Dcui, ThnrRdoij, iZlh Fehruary, 1862.
</p>
<p>Narayan Dinnanathjee, re-examined by Mr. Anstey.  1 am not a follower of the
</p>
<p>Maharaj nor a Vaishnav. I am the only member of my family who is acquainted with
</p>
<p>Jeevunjee Maharaj. My nephew Shamrao is assisting the plaintiff's case by desire of Mr.
</p>
<p>Kelly, to whom he is an " articled clerk." I don't know if he is so assisting at the request
</p>
<p>of Vurjeevandas Madhaodas. All the parties connected with the defendant knew very well
</p>
<p>that I was acquainted with Jeevunjee. It was Mathooradass that applied to me first for
</p>
<p>the translations, and he knew very well that I was a friend of Jeevunjee Maharaj. I be-
</p>
<p>lieve in the Bhugwut Gita on which witnesses are sworn. I know Sanscrit to a certain
</p>
<p>extent, but am not a very learned Sanscrit scholar. I have no doubt of the accuracy of my
</p>
<p>translations from the Brij Bhasha. I have read four or five of the old Sanscrit dramas
</p>
<p>which are extant at the present day. I cannot read them with great facility. I believe
</p>
<p>the Sanscrit and Persian are entirely different languages ; I would not refer to a Per-
</p>
<p>sian dictionary for the meaning of a Sanscrit word. I gave the meaning to the word
</p>
<p>"Surut" according to the best of my ability ; since then I have referred to Molesworth's
</p>
<p>Dictionary. (Reads the meanings of the word.) I meant to say in my cross-examination
</p>
<p>that I had not, before the libel, heard of the " Eus mundlee" festival. I have heard of
</p>
<p>16,000 married wives of Krishna, but I said I never heard of 16,000 " gopees :" he
</p>
<p>might have had them besides. I translated extracts from Goculnathjee's Commentary,
</p>
<p>which I had not read before the libel. I have seen pictures of " Ras lila." (Mr. Anstey
</p>
<p>hands a picture to witness.) This is not a picture of " Eas lila :" I don't know what it
</p>
<p>is. I cannot say if this is a picture of " Eas lila" understood in the sense in which
</p>
<p>defendant understands it. I did go in once when worship was going on in Jeevunjee's temple ;
</p>
<p>there is no prohibition. I never went to the part of the temple where women are admitted.
</p>
<p>I saw the ceremony of waving the lights and the image also. I never heard of an accusation of
</p>
<p>improprieties against the Maharajas. When there is no occasion for it, I would consider
</p>
<p>the throwing of " golal" an improper, not indecent act. Throwing it on females I consider
</p>
<p>it improper, rude, uncivil, and almost indecent act. It has no connection with the sense of
</p>
<p>adultery. " Bhooka" means powder of every kind. I don't know what powder the Maharajas
</p>
<p>mix with golal which they throw on females. Eeads from a sacred book, but is not able
</p>
<p>to say if throwing certain powders on females is equivalent to seducing, (seduction). I
</p>
<p>don't know of any sect, except the Vallabahcharya, in which there are hereditary gooroos by
</p>
<p>blood or adoption. I think among the Shivites the head disciple succeeds a gooroo. The
</p>
<p>Maharaja I am acquainted with is a very learned nian, but I am told he is an exception.

</p>
<p>The other Maharajas are not to be respected for any learning. All Hindu gooroos allow
</p>
<p>females to approach them for being respected by touching their feet. Some gooroos don't
</p>
<p>allow their feet to be touched. I have not seen any gooroos throw golal upon females. I
</p>
<p>have seen some females touch the feet of gooroos. I am speaking generally. In no sect
</p>
<p>that I know of is the gooroo swung in a swing, or has his body rubbed with saffron-
</p>
<p>water by males or females ; I don't know of the leavings of any gooroos' meals being eaten
</p>
<p>by their followers, or the water falling from their " langotees" drunk. I have seen the
</p>
<p>wooden shoes of some gooroos respected. The person who puts the sacred thread upon a
</p>
<p>Hindu child, whether the father, or the elder of the family, or the family priest, is con-
</p>
<p>sidered to be the child's gooroo. I cannot say when the custom of having gooroos originated.
</p>
<p>I don't know if the dedication of " tun, mun, and dhun" is made by females to any
</p>
<p>133
</p>
<p>gooroos but the Maharajas. I have seen the Marathee version of Goculnathjee's Commen-
</p>
<p>tary- I think it enjoins the dedication of " tun, mun and dhun" to the Acharaya. I
</p>
<p>understood the v^'ord " Purshotum" to apply to God only ; I don't know in what sense the
</p>
<p>Valshnavs take it. Referring to the passage containing the libel, I do not agree with Dr.
</p>
<p>Wilson that it is in the suspensive mood. I never heard of a suspensive participle. I
</p>
<p>have not the slightest doubt that the passage is not conditional : I don't agree with Dr.
</p>
<p>Wilson's version of it."
</p>
<p>(9.) Mathooradass Lowjee, examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I am a Bhattia merchant,
</p>
<p>find am a member ot the Vallabhacharya sect. I know the Brij Bhasha, the Gujeratee,
</p>
<p>and the Marathee languages. I am acquainted with the sacred books of my sect. (Xames
</p>
<p>some of the books which he has read.) I am not able to read Sanscrit or Persian. I
</p>
<p>have given these books to Karsandass for the purpose ot be ing produced in Court. 1 con-
</p>
<p>sider myself skilled in the doctrines of my sect and the ancient religion of the Hindoos. T
</p>
<p>heard the ancient religion expounded from the Bhagwut and other two works. Our religion
</p>
<p>differs from the ancient religion. Idolatry is not enjoined by the Veds. It is mentioned
</p>
<p>in a book called " Balbodh" that none would be able to read the Yeds in the Kali-Yug
</p>
<p>(present time), and that the acts mentioned in the Yeds would not lead to salvation. In
</p>
<p>a work by Goculnathjee it is stated that the Shastras are not to be followed which are
</p>
<p>opposed to the doctrines of the " Pooshtee Marg" (the doctrines of the Yallabhacharya sect).
</p>
<p>In our sect, " Poorn Purshotum," and his incarnations Yallabhacharya and Wittulnathjee,
</p>
<p>are considered as God. The Maharajas are considered as those incarnations, and
</p>
<p>are known as the children of Yallabh. Poorn Purshotum, Acharya, &c. There
</p>
<p>are 108 names given to Yallabhacharya and his descendants, which names are
</p>
<p>similar to the 108 names of the Supreme Being. Maharajas are called " Maha Prubhoo'
</p>
<p>(great God) by several devotees at the time of worship. The major part of the Bhattia
</p>
<p>caste worship the Maharajas as God, and also worship their portraits. Each Maharaj is
</p>
<p>also worshipped by his individual name, and is regarded as God from his birth, without
</p>
<p>reference to his subsequent character or qualifications. Yallabh is regarded as the incarnation
</p>
<p>of the head of the Supreme Being. In reality, he was the son of Luxmon Bhutt, a
</p>
<p>Telinga Brahmin. The Telinga Brahmins would not dine or associate with his descen-
</p>
<p>dants. The Maharajas have about two lacs of followers out of some twelve crores of
</p>
<p>Hindoos. Except when putting the " kanthee" round the neck of a child, the Maharaj
</p>
<p>never gives religious instruction. The Maharaj, at the performance of the " kanthee"
</p>
<p>ceremony, makes a person repeat a " muntra" (incantation) to this effect :  " I have been

</p>
<p>separated from Krishna for a long time. I dedicate my body, mind, wealth, organs, wife,
</p>
<p>children, house, and all to Krishna." The Maharaj desires the person to repeat it to him
</p>
<p>(the Maharaj). Children are made to repeat this " muntra," as also young girls and lads
</p>
<p>on the occasions of their marriage. The Maharaj is Krishna ; and a Yaishanav dedicates
</p>
<p>to him " his tun, mun, and dhun." In practice all a person's wealth is not given to the
</p>
<p>Maharaj ! but as to women, he commits adultery. " Eas lila" means amorous sport, carnal
</p>
<p>intercourse. This picture (an indecent one) is a correct representation of the sport Krishna
</p>
<p>had with women. There are many such pictures in the Maharajas' temples. This book is
</p>
<p>believed in by the sect ; it contains this picture, in which there are represented naked
</p>
<p>women and Krishna at the top of a tree. One of the pictures represents the women,
</p>
<p>shepherdesses, as coming out after bathing ; the other represents them as playing with
</p>
<p>golal and the colour of Kessoora flowers (yellow) with Krishna. " Bhooka" is a sacred
</p>
<p>powder called " abir," and is used with golal. The followers of the Maharajas, males and
</p>
<p>ir34
</p>
<p>females, will, after death, become " gopees," for the purpose of having amorous sport " Kas
</p>
<p>lila," with God, in which the Maharajs will take part and enjoy both as gods and as
</p>
<p>gopees. The Maharajas, when they worship the image, wear long hair because they regard
</p>
<p>themselves as gopees in this world. I had conversation with the plaintiff to the effect that
</p>
<p>I should arrange with Jeevanlalljee Maharaj to write and edit the " Propagator of our own
</p>
<p>Eeligion" during the time he (plaintiff) would be away from Bombay. It was started by
</p>
<p>plaintiff in the name of a society, of which he is the president. I received this hand-bill
</p>
<p>at the entrance of plaintiffs dwelling-house. I have read it. I am known In my sect bj
</p>
<p>the name of " Mathoora Punth," because my opinions are opposed to the immoralities and
</p>
<p>adultery of the Maharajas, and as if I was the founder of a new sect. This is not the
</p>
<p>case. From my infancy I was instructed by my father not to believe in the practices of
</p>
<p>the Maharajas, which, he said, are immoral and adulterous. Many persons in my sect
</p>
<p>know the fact, but refrain from avowing it for several reasons. Since the last eight or nine
</p>
<p>years I have explained to my friends these immoralities. I respected the Maharajas out-
</p>
<p>wardly ; my friends did the same. In the year 1912 (1855) a writing was prepared by
</p>
<p>Bhattias to prevent females from going to the Maharajas unless at certain hours, and with
</p>
<p>the view of preventing the adulteries. It was resolved that the writing should come into
</p>
<p>force after a year. There was a dispute at the time between the Maharajs and the Bhoo-
</p>
<p>leshwar Brahmins, and it was apprehended that, if the document was made public, the
</p>
<p>Brahmins might obtain a triumph. The year elapsed, but the agreement was not brought
</p>
<p>into force. Since this action commenced, a hand-bill was issued from the press of plaintifiTs
</p>
<p>manager Purbhoodas, with the object of suppressing the agreement and preventing its being
</p>
<p>produced in this Court. The Maharajas' adulteries were a matter of notoriety in the sect,
</p>
<p>and there has been no improvement since 1855. I remember having been often to the
</p>
<p>garden of Goculdass Tejpall with Khuttao Mukunjee. About eight years ago I went there
</p>
<p>with him, when at the entrance we were informed by the malice that a Maharaj was in-
</p>
<p>side with four women. Seeing us go in, Lukhmidass Khlmjee followed us. Goculdass was
</p>
<p>in the garden opposite, knowing the Maharaj was in his own garden with the women.
</p>
<p>We went in. Khuttao stopped in the dining-room. I entered by another door, and saw
</p>
<p>two widows sitting outside. They told me something, but notwithstanding that, I pushed forward.
</p>
<p>1 found the door of a room fastened from inside, and removed the latch with a knife. I
</p>
<p>saw there Maharaj Yachalalljee in the act of connection with a woman. The other woman
</p>
<p>was sitting in the room. The Maharaj was ashamed on seeing me, and put on his
</p>
<p>" dhotia" (waist cloth). [Mr. Bay ley objected to this sort of evidence being gone into, as

</p>
<p>the alleged act did not concern the plaintiff. Mr. Anstey contended that this part of the
</p>
<p>evidence was necessary to disprove one of the allegations of the plaint. The learned coun-
</p>
<p>sel would rely on the 7th plea, which embraced the practices of all the Maharajas. The
</p>
<p>defendants' witnesses were challenged if they could name a single instance of adultery from
</p>
<p>personal observation, and now that there was an instance, the plaintiff's counsel wanted to
</p>
<p>stop the witness. The Court overruled the objection. Witness continued.] " The woman
</p>
<p>was of the Bhattia caste and a member of the sect. She was about 25 or 30 years of
</p>
<p>age, and was a married woman. I paid my respects to the Maharaj on seeing him com-
</p>
<p>mit the act ! ! Goculiass was sent for ; the Maharaj gave him some sweatmeat and
</p>
<p>pan soparee. The women went away, and a companion of Goculdass struck one of them in
</p>
<p>the head. I refused to conceal the act ; I said I never would conceal such an act. There
</p>
<p>is a club among the Bhattias of my sect called " Bus mundlee," of which the members
</p>
<p>are very much respected, as they pay greater homage to the Maharajas and commit moi
</p>
<p>135
</p>
<p>adultery. The members would not admit a stranger. They go to the meeting with their
</p>
<p>wives. I was never a member.
</p>
<p>The Court rose at 6 P. M. The Court-house was more excessively crowded than on
</p>
<p>any previous day.
</p>
<p>Thirleentfi Bay, Friday, 14/// February, 18G2.
</p>
<p>Mathooradas Lowjee continued.  " I have frequently seen females approaching the
</p>
<p>person of Maharajas. I have seen ten or twenty Maharajas worshipped by females. The
</p>
<p>females touch the soles of the Maharajas' feet with their hands, and then apply them to
</p>
<p>their own eyes. I have seen females perform this kind of worship to plaintiff Several
</p>
<p>Maharajas press the toes of their female devotees. I have not seen the plaintiff do this.
</p>
<p>J'ressing the toes is a sign of a desire for adultery. When the females look at the Maha-
</p>
<p>rajas, the latter make signs with their eyes. Accordingly, the females take this hint and
</p>
<p>retire into a room. I speak this from my personal knowledge. (A packet containing golal
</p>
<p>was shown to the Court and put in as an exhibit.) This powder is thrown on the occasion
</p>
<p>of the Vussunt Punchmee (which falls shortly before the Holee holidays). The golal is
</p>
<p>thrown by the Maharaj on the persons of such females as he wishes to gratify his desire
</p>
<p>with. Golal water is also thrown by means of syringes, and the Maharaj takes precise aim
</p>
<p>at the females. This is done with the same object and purpose. Females sing " gurbees"
</p>
<p>(songs) of an amorous character in the presence of the Maharajas ;  such as " I was
</p>
<p>asleep and you awoke me," " you will ease my mind if you will take me," " you are
</p>
<p>my husband," and so on. The purport of such songs is evident as sung in the presence of
</p>
<p>the Maharajas It is notorious that the Maharajas are adulterers. The plaintiffs reputation is
</p>
<p>no way better than that of the other Maharajas. According to our Shastras, conduct such as this
</p>
<p>(throwing powders on females) is considered equivalent to adultery ; and in fact, under the
</p>
<p>head of adultery in a religious book, it is so described. " Choowa," a sort of fluid, is thrown
</p>
<p>by females on the persons of the Maharajas. Such conduct is witnessed quietly by the hus-
</p>
<p>bands of females who sing the " gurbees" before the Maharajas. I first became acquainted
</p>
<p>with Judoonathjee about sixteen months ago, when he paid a visit to the house of Jewraz
</p>
<p>Balloo and sent for me. I am acquainted with about seven or eight Maharajas in Bombay.
</p>
<p>They are Jeevunjee, the head Maharaj, Goculeshjee, Dhishjee, Goculadhishjee, Chimunjee,
</p>
<p>Muggunjee, Dwarkanathjee, and Jadoonathjee. I have been out of Bombay, and have seen
</p>
<p>Maharajas at Kutch Mandavie,' Beyt, &c. The Maharaj at Mandavie is Kunchorjee, and I
</p>
<p>was also acquainted there with Majee Maharaj ; the widow of a Maharaj.
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse remarked that since the Court rose yesterday, he had read over the

</p>
<p>pleas of justification, and came to the opinion that the evidence, as to the individual acts
</p>
<p>of other Maharajas ought not to be admitted, and that the evidence to that effect already on
</p>
<p>record should be struck out. It would be struck out accordingly. It would be an injustice
</p>
<p>to absent individuals to admit evidence of their guilt. Any evidence as to general reputa-
</p>
<p>tion, would not of course be objected to.
</p>
<p>Witness continued.  " Eventually ihe Maharajas refused to accede to my request not to
</p>
<p>admit females into the temple unless at certain hours. The refusal was made after some
</p>
<p> 136
</p>
<p>discussion. I am unwilling to reveal what private conversation I had with Jeevunjee,
</p>
<p>unless forced to give it out. Jeevunjee said all persons are masters of iheir own houses,
</p>
<p>and adultery has increased very much, and it is difficult to stop it. He could not, he
</p>
<p>said, remonstrate with his elders or with those who were superior to him. If he attempted
</p>
<p>to remonstrate, he was afraid the other INIaharajas would not mind him ; and he, therefore,
</p>
<p>suggested that I should secure the aid of Shreenathjee and Muttressjee-walla Maharajas.
</p>
<p>Without their co-operation, he said, nothing could be effected. As the females were the
</p>
<p>source of great income to the Maharajas, it was rather a very serious matter, he said to
</p>
<p>stop that source of income, and thus deprive them cf the means of defraying their
</p>
<p>expenses. He added that, like an opium-eater, a man could not give up the practice of
</p>
<p>lust, and therefore it was not possible to put a stop at once to the practices of the Maha-
</p>
<p>rajas. He advised me to have patience in the matter of this desired reform. I had
</p>
<p>similar conversation with Jeevunjee on another occasion. I stayed for about four hours
</p>
<p>with plaintiff at the house of Jewraz Balloo. He also sent for me on other occasions. On
</p>
<p>the first occasion I had some discussion with him on the subject of female education, in
</p>
<p>the course of which he desired me to do as he or the Maharajas directed. I said we
</p>
<p>are not bound to do so, unless what you say is good. He said you are bound to act
</p>
<p>according to what we say. I said I can show you precedents from the Shastras, upon
</p>
<p>which he desired me to see him at his house. I said the Maharajas do not study the
</p>
<p>Shastras and instruct their followers, as it is their duty to do. He said that was not
</p>
<p>necessary, and that the followers must do what the Maharajas directed them to do. I
</p>
<p>spoke of the desirability of establishing a library, when plaintiff said he had prepared a list
</p>
<p>for the purpose, and ask me to procure subscriptions. I said I would procure the subscrip-
</p>
<p>tions, but that the money could not be entrusted to him. He then said I and my friends
</p>
<p>might keep the money. This was subsequently to the publication of the libel. The
</p>
<p>Shankaracharyas do not allow women to approach them. I have read of the ten principles
</p>
<p>in the Brij Bhasha and the Marathee languages. The doctrines mentioned in these corres-
</p>
<p>pond in substance with those of the sacred books. The doctrines propounded in plaintiff's
</p>
<p>works and Goculnathjee's commentary, are to my mind productive of adultery in the sect, and
</p>
<p>lend encouragement to it. It is said in the " Propagator of Our Own lleligion" that we
</p>
<p>ought to be in adulterine love with God ; in another place it is said such love cannot be
</p>
<p>cherished in the Kali Yug. Of this two contradictory injunctions, the former, to my mind,
</p>
<p>would have effect over a person's mind much more readily than the latter. The adulterine
</p>
<p>love with God means something as the adulterine love between the Maharajas and the

<p>Vaishnavs. The meaning of the dedication of the " tun" is that the wives and daughters
</p>
<p>of the devotees are dedicated to the Maharajas. The seat or " baituck" of the Maharajas,
</p>
<p>even, in his absence, is w^orshipped and respected by the devotees. I was myself present
</p>
<p>at the meeting of the Bhattias in 1855, and took a part in the proceedings.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bayley.  " I am not called Mathoora Punth because I have
</p>
<p>founded, or am about to found, a new sect ; it is only because I have opposed the
</p>
<p>adulterous practices of the Maharajas. I frequent at present the temple of Jeevunjee
</p>
<p>Maharaj. I don't send my wife to that or any other temple, though it is the custom
</p>
<p>among the Vaishnavs to send their wives. The wives of very few Vaishnavs do not go
</p>
<p>to the temples. I do not worship Jeevunjee as God. The other Vaishnavs touch the
</p>
<p>Maharaja's feet, swing him in a swing, a sacred necklace is put round the neck of the
</p>
<p>Maharaj in the same way as it is put round the neck of the image ; they take up the
</p>
<p>dust of the feet of the Maharaj and eat it or put it into their mouth. When worshipping.
</p>
<p>137
</p>
<p>they call him Maha Prabhoojee. Purshotum, Vullubh Dev, &c. I can swear that the Maharaj
</p>
<p>is addressed to in these names of the vSupreme Being, and not the image, which is in an
</p>
<p>inner room. The Maharajas take their seat outside. At that time, the doors of the room
</p>
<p>containing the image are shut. I have been to the temples belonging to the other Maha-
</p>
<p>rajas ; the form of worship is the same in all. I went to worship the image only. I
</p>
<p>joined my hands to the Maharaj, but did not worship him in any way. It is stated in
</p>
<p>the sacred books that the worship of the Maharaj should be performed in the same way as
</p>
<p>that of God. The Maharajas are Brahmins, and are regarded as gooroos. As Brahmins
</p>
<p>they are not the preceptors of rehgion. A few of the Vaishnavs do not consider the
</p>
<p>Maharajas as gods. I do not, but my brother does consider them as such. The dedication
</p>
<p>of " tun, mun, and dhun" is not at present made by all Hindus. That after the dedica-
</p>
<p>tion, the Maharaj can do what he pleases with females, is a matter of notoriety. I have
</p>
<p>not seen any act of impropriety by the plaintiff ; I have heard. About four years ago,
</p>
<p>on the occasion of the marriage of my daughter, a Maharaja was invited by the father-
</p>
<p>in-law of the girl. A Maharaja then demanded a fine from me of Ks. 5-4 which I
</p>
<p>refused to pay ; it was for my appearing in mourning. " Krishna Lila" means amorous
</p>
<p>sport with Krishna, which commenced when he was six or seven years old, and lasted till
</p>
<p>he reached his eleventh year. Some four or five years ago, I saw dramas of this story of
</p>
<p>Krishna, which were performed in Maharaja's temples before males and females. Pictures
</p>
<p>of this story are sometimes observed on the walls of some buildings, not on the walls of
</p>
<p>temples. The women, however, are not painted naked. This book containing one indecent
</p>
<p>and some other pictures was published at Ahmedabad five years ago : it is an abridgement
</p>
<p>of the Bhagwut. It is recognised among the Vaishnavs ; there are some parts of it which
</p>
<p>are recognised by others. It is certainly indecent to observe naked men or women on the
</p>
<p>top of a tree. I have never appeared in that manner on a tree. I have not seen any pictures
</p>
<p>in the Veds. The Maharajas wear long hair and consider themselves as " gopees"
</p>
<p>(covvherdesses) in this world. It is so stated in one of the sacred books. The hair on the
</p>
<p>head is worn by the Hindus not with the object that angles may hold us by it and pull
</p>
<p>us up to heaven : it is to be tied up at the time of worship. The plaintiff is a mere
</p>
<p>humbug when he pretends to encourage female education. I have heard that he opened a
</p>
<p>female school in Surat ; and he collected subscriptions in Bombay for defraying its
</p>
<p>expenses. At the meeting of the Bhattias held in 1855, several resolutions were passed,
</p>
<p>one of which was to prevent females from going to the temples at night during the cold
</p>
<p>season. The object was to prevent them being defiled by the Maharajas. I have seen

</p>
<p>Goculadhishjee make signs to females two or three times about five or six years ago. From
</p>
<p>their dress I knew the women belonged to our caste. The place in which the Maharaj 's
</p>
<p>females reside is separate from the place where these acts are committed. I have been to
</p>
<p>his bed-room, and have seen females going into and coming out of his bed- room. I have
</p>
<p>been there only once, five or six years ago. He had sent for me, as there was a subscription
</p>
<p>list to be prepared. Widows are constantly near the Maharajas' bed-rooms : it is their
</p>
<p>business. I have seen Dwarkanathjee Maharaj giving a signal to a female to go into his
</p>
<p>bed-room. On seeing me, he held back his hand with which he was making the signal.
</p>
<p>She was asking something of the Maharaj, and the latter said " take this"  (Witness
</p>
<p>explains the very incedent attitude and signal made.) The female was a married woman,
</p>
<p>about twenty years of age. I once threw golal on the mother-in-law of my daughter, on
</p>
<p>the occasion of her marriage. This sprinkling of golal was done with respect, not in the
</p>
<p>way in which Maharajas throw it. On throwing the golal, T made her a present of
</p>
<p>18
</p>
<p>138
</p>
<p>money. 1 remember one Matoojee Maharaj held a meeting some years ago at Mahaluxmee,
</p>
<p>on which occasion golal was thrown. In the island of Beyt, when the Maharajas throw
</p>
<p>golal, they touch the females. Licentious songs are sung by females on occasions of
</p>
<p>marriage ; but when they are addressed to the Maharajas, the females singing them wish
</p>
<p>for carnal intercourse with them (the Maharajas). In some songs, on occasions of marriage,
</p>
<p>the women on one side wish those on other side to exchange husbands, for the time being
</p>
<p>of course. Such a thing is never done ; it is carried into practice only with the Maharaj.
</p>
<p>I have seen the seats of Maharajas at Bombay, Beyt, and Mandavie worshipped by
</p>
<p>Vaishnavs. If the Bhattias of Bombay were educated at all, such adulteries would not
</p>
<p>prevail amongst them. The report in the Sati/a Prakash is not a full report of the
</p>
<p>Bhattia meeting held in 1855 : the resolution about the females and the Maharajas is
</p>
<p>omitted.
</p>
<p>Ke-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " At the time of the Bhattia meeting in 1855, I read
</p>
<p>the Smnmacliar in which the substance of the resolution about the females is given. It
</p>
<p>is also correctly given in the Jam-i-Jamshed. (These papers are put in as exhibits.) The
</p>
<p>resolution was not embodied in the report published in the Satya Prakash, because it was
</p>
<p>not come into force until a year afterwards. I think the singing of licentious songs on
</p>
<p>occasions of marriage is going out of fashion through the primary exertions ot the Satya
</p>
<p>Prakash. The Maharajas sitting in conclave threatened to fine me once, because I had a
</p>
<p>controversy with them. They have committed many such extortions. The plaintiff said
</p>
<p>he had opened a female school at Surat : I had no further knowledge of its being a fact.
</p>
<p>There is a principal temple of a Maharajah at Beyt."

<p>(10.)  Dr. Bhawuo Dajee, examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I am a Graduate of the
</p>
<p>Grant Medical College, and a private practitioner. I am a prizeman of the Elphinstone
</p>
<p>College. I won a prize on the best essay on Female Infanticide in Kattiawar. I was
</p>
<p>a member ot the ' late Board of Education, and am a Fellow of the Bombay Univer-

<p>twice professionally.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey.  What was the nature of the disease ?
</p>
<p>Er. Bhawoo.  " Am I bound, my Lord, to name the disease which I came to
</p>
<p>know confidentially in the course of my profession ?
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse.  It is a proper objection on the part ot this gentleman.
</p>
<p>139
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey cited authorities to show that the objection cannot be upheld. One of the
</p>
<p>pleas asserts distinctly that the plaintiff suffered from a certain disease, and the defendants
</p>
<p>were bound to prove it.
</p>
<p>The objection was overruled.
</p>
<p>^'itness continued.  " The disease was syphilis, which is commonly known as the
</p>
<p>venerial disease. I did not treat him for it, he mentioned to me that he was suffering
</p>
<p>from " chandee," and would send a man to me the following day. " Chandee" literally
</p>
<p>means chancre, an ulcer. There were two friends present. Mr. Lukhmidass Khimjee and
</p>
<p>Eao Saheb Vishwanath Narayen, who retired as soon as the plaintiff began to describe to
</p>
<p>me the disease. So far as I remember I did not visit him again. He said the story of
</p>
<p>the case would be explained to me the next day. It was communicated to me by Gover-
</p>
<p>dhundass, plaintiff's secretary and disciple.
</p>
<p>(Mr. Bayley again objected to the witness entering into the particulars. Mr. Anstey
</p>
<p>argued and cited authorities as to the objection. Witness to Sir M. Sausse.  Plaintiff said
</p>
<p>to me that he would send Goverdhundass. The objection was overruled). Witness conti-
</p>
<p>nued.  Goverdhundass came to me the next day, and said Maharaj Jadunathjee was suffer-
</p>
<p>ing from chancre. I insisted upon an ocular inspection, and in the meantime prescribed
</p>
<p>simple ointment. He did not send for me again. I have attended three other similar
</p>
<p>cases connected with Maharajas. I saw Jadunathjee's father at Surat in December 1849.
</p>
<p>I went to his house. He lived on the second story of his house. There was a private
</p>
<p>staircase pointed out to me, by which a person could pass out without the knowledge of
</p>
<p>those in the rooms on the first story. The plaintiff does not bear a good reputation ; I
</p>
<p>have a very unfavorable opinion as to his character for chastity and morality. I have
</p>
<p>known only one learned Maharaj : the rest are not above the average of ordinary Brahmins.
</p>
<p>The Maharajas are respected for their descent, not for their learning. They are worshipped
</p>
<p>as incarnations of Krishna. I have seen them worshipped. After the visitors have paid
</p>
<p>their respect to the idol, they go to pay it to the Maharaj who sits outside. There is no order
</p>
<p>among visitors ; there is great hustling and elbowing of men and women together. At the
</p>
<p>entrance to the inner room, there is a railing on which two persons stand with large cords
</p>
<p>in their hands. Accidents have occurred from the striking of the cords. I have known an
</p>
<p>instance in which ornaments were lost in the crowd. I have seen the Maharaja's bath,
</p>
<p>and hundreds rushing to drink the water dripping from his " lungotee." The women apply
</p>
<p>their hands to the soles of his feet and eat the dust. In the compound of this (the Bho-
</p>
<p>leshwur) temple, there is a one storied house, to which the Maharaj repairs after he has

</p>
<p>done with the personal worship of the image. The devotees pay more attention to the
</p>
<p>Maharaj than to the idol. There are two rooms in the house and two staircases, one lead-
</p>
<p>ing to the temple and one to the outer gate. There is an entrance from the zenana into
</p>
<p>the Maharaj 's bed-room. The inmates of the zenana have their faces always covered, but
</p>
<p>the faces of the female devotees are uncovered. In this temple I have seen several pictures
</p>
<p>representing the sport of Krishna with the gopees ; I don't think they were indecent.
</p>
<p>About twenty years ago, I saw a Maharaj exhibiting indecent pictures to men and women.
</p>
<p>His conversation was all about women : it was somewhat indecent. On one or two occa-
</p>
<p>sions, a Maharaj applied to me for medicines which would prevent a woman from being
</p>
<p>pregnant. I had conversation with Jeevunjee Maharaj al)Out the immorality of the other
</p>
<p>Maharajas, once publicly. I remonstrated with him, but he said he had no control over the
</p>
<p>adulterous acts of the Maharajas. This was about three years ago The Maharajas are sectaries,
</p>
<p>140
</p>
<p>and are not good Brahmins. A Brahmin has six duties to perform :  Sacrificing and assisting
</p>
<p>at sacrifices, taking charity and giving charity, &c. The Maharajas only take charity. The
</p>
<p>great majority of them are not fit to be gooroos. Their acts are inconsistent with the an-
</p>
<p>cient doctrines of the Hindoos. A gooroo is a person who initiates a child : it may be his
</p>
<p>father, his relative or the family priest. There is no mention of " tun, mun and dhun,"
</p>
<p>in our " gayetri," or verse of initiation, which is to be recited only mentally. It is not
</p>
<p>innocent sport to throw " golal" on a female : it is considered one of the three forms of
</p>
<p>adultery. (Reads the translation of a passage from one of the Hindu law books called Miiax)-a.)
</p>
<p>The Law about Adultery is now told. [Adultery means the mutual connection of a
</p>
<p>man with another's wife, (or the means of bringing about the connection.)]
</p>
<p>V^asa describes three varieties of adultery, in order that the adulterer may receive
</p>
<p>the punishment for crime of the first degree or for crime of the middle degree, or for crime
</p>
<p>of the highest degree.
</p>
<p>Fi)-st Adallery.  In uninhabited spots, on untimely occasions with (slang) language
</p>
<p>other than the current language of the country, casting lewd glances towards another's wife
</p>
<p>" or smiling" [(sporting) addition in the Marathi translation] this is called first adultery.
</p>
<p>Middle Adultery.  Enticing [a woman] by good perfumes [(such as sandle, Buka,
</p>
<p>Argaja, &c.) addition in the Marathi translation] flowers, incense, ornaments, clothes, food,
</p>
<p>and drink, is called middle adultery.
</p>
<p>Highest Adultery.  Sitting in retirement and on one seat, and embracing each other,
</p>
<p>placing hands on [one another's] shoulders, and holding [each other's] hands and playing
</p>
<p>by taking hold of each other's hair is called highest adultery.
</p>
<p>Note.  The above is a translation of the Vyavaharadhyaya of the Mitakshara from the
</p>
<p>Marathi translation of the Sanskrit original, published in Bombay by order of Government
</p>
<p>in 1844. I have compared this English translation with the original Sanskrit text publish-
</p>
<p>ed under the authority of the committee of Public Instruction in 1829 at Calcutta. The

<p>Professor H. H. Wilson's dictionary and in the Bhagwut. I can best describe the way in
</p>
<p>which the Maharajas wear their hair by showing a photograph taken by my brother (Dr.
</p>
<p>Narayan Dajee). (The photograph is put in as an exhibit.) Except in one respect, the
</p>
<p>way in which they wear their hair is peculiar. There have long been public discussions
</p>
<p>and notices of the conduct and character of the Maharajas. The earliest bitter notice that
</p>
<p>I saw was in the Dhoomketoo five or six years ago. I believe all the Maharaj as wear silver
</p>
<p>toe-rings. This passage at the end of the alleged libel I would read thus, according to my
</p>
<p>judgment :  " Oh, ye Maharajs, acting on that commentary, you spoil the daughters, &c, of
</p>
<p>your disciples, raise your hands from that, and destroy at once immoralities like the ' Rus
</p>
<p>raundlee.' " I think that upon the whole " acting on that commentary" is quite positive.
</p>
<p>I think " desist from acting" is the most emphatic part of the passage. The passage is
</p>
<p>addressed to the Maharajas generally. The plaintiff, before he was a Maharaj, had a very
</p>
<p>bad reputation as to his chastity at Surat ; but he was then equally revered as a Maharaj.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bay ley.  " In the course of my private practice, I have at-
</p>
<p>tended upon hundreds of different castes of natives, both high and low. I am sure the
</p>
<p>141
</p>
<p>plamtiflf used the word " chandee." It is possible patients may be mistaken in describing
</p>
<p>the symptoms of a disease. " Chandee" originally means silver ; it is used as a slang term
</p>
<p>for chancre.
</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  " I was told the plaintiff employed another practitioner ; he
</p>
<p>did not like to expose himself.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Bayley.  " I think the plaintiff was not of a sanguine, but of a phlegmatic
</p>
<p>temperament. I know nothing of plaintiff's disease personally except what I was told by
</p>
<p>him and his secretary. I wish decidedly for a better state of things among the Hindus
</p>
<p>generally. I heard from plaintiff that he had established a female school in Surat : he
</p>
<p>wanted to train up the girls in the doctrines of his sect. I have never been present at
</p>
<p>" Rus mundilees," they are described in books, and are known to exist as secret societies.
</p>
<p>I think Krishna had no improper connection with the gopees : they were in love with him.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley asked witness some questions about the Veds and Purans, when
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould said.  This is all very interesting, but we must really save time
</p>
<p>in this enquiry. If we were sitting here to listtn to lectures on the Purans, surely we
</p>
<p>could have no better authority than Dr. Bhawoo Dajee.
</p>
<p>Re-examined by Mr. Anstey.  The story of the gopees and Krishna is not confined
</p>
<p>to the Vallabhacharya sect. Uneducated persons take it literally, but not so enlightened
</p>
<p>persons.
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  " Some of the Maharajas, as I have heard, are men of unspot-
</p>
<p>ted character, men of piety, and good men ; and therefore I said the passage refers to the
</p>
<p>Maharajas generally.
</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  " I think the passage in question is directed as an exhorta-
</p>
<p>tion to the whole class of Maharajas, not to the plaintiff personally.
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  " From the context, I say the remark is not necessarily directed
</p>
<p>to the plaintiff, or necessarily implied against him. It is possible a reader may understand
</p>
<p>that it applies to the plaintiff.
</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  " I myself understand it as a general exhortation, and any
</p>
<p>intelligent reader would so understand it ;  I mean a reader of fair ordinary intelligence.
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  " The expression " adopt a virtuous course of conduct" does not
</p>
<p>imply any imputation against the plaintiff ; it is an exhortation to set a good example.
</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  " The exhortation 1 think is carried on from the commence-
</p>
<p>ment of the paragraph to the words " desist from that." Nothing is imputed to the
</p>
<p>plaintiff distinctly. I think decidedly that the plaintiff is not singled out. Any imputation

</p>
<p>upon him would be inferential, not direct.
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  " I am of opinion that it is not intended against the plaintiff in
</p>
<p>a direct manner. The article in the original does not allude specially to the plaintiff. The
</p>
<p>English translation, now in my hands, tends that way. Reading the Gujerattee article, I
</p>
<p>don't think the plaintiff is intended to be included among the licentious Maharajas. From
</p>
<p>my knowledge of his antecedents, T would include him.
</p>
<p>142
</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  As a reader not acquainted with his antecedents, I would be

<p>doubtful whether I must include him or not."
</p>
<p>(11.) Dr. Dhh-ajram Dulputram, examined by Mr. Anstey.  "I am a Graduate of
</p>
<p>the Grant Medical College and a private practitioner. I know the plaintiff, whom I first
</p>
<p>met in July 1860, at the girl school of Munguldass Nathoobhoy. In consequence of some-
</p>
<p>thing said to me, I called upon him at his house. In December 1860, I attended upon him
</p>
<p>professionally at his house. He was suffering from venerial affection ; I made an ocular
</p>
<p>examination- of it, and found it to be an ulcer. He gave me the history of the case ; he
</p>
<p>said he had suffered from it three or four months previously and had caught it from an
</p>
<p>impure intercourse with a woman. I prescribed the blackwash externally, and mercury
</p>
<p>internally. Plaintiff said he suffered some years ago from the same affection, and had
</p>
<p>taken a preparation of mercury, prepared by himself. Plaintiff asked me if I had read in
</p>
<p>medical works that the disease would go by having intercourse with a temale free from it.
</p>
<p>I said I had not. He then said he had twice tried the experiment at Surat. He suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded once in it, but not the second time, because he was then much reduced.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bayley.  " The plaintiff, when I saw him in December 1860,
</p>
<p>appeared to have been suffering for three months previously. My opii^ion as to the ulcer
</p>
<p>being syphilitic was confirmed by plaintiffs histor}^ of his case. I did make a personal
</p>
<p>examination. I treated the plaintiff for more than a month. I had seen him in Surat a
</p>
<p>good many years ago. There is a difference of opinion among doctors as to whether
</p>
<p>mercury is necessary in Syphilis. The blackwash I applied externally was mercurial. I
</p>
<p>have treated a good many persons in high rank for this complaint. The plaintiff was alone
</p>
<p>in the backroom when I saw him : the room had more than two windows. In the com-
</p>
<p>mencement of the treatment, I told plaintiff not to go out. I saw him sometime before I
</p>
<p>treated him. I have known the defendant for the last seven or eight years ; but never
</p>
<p>communicated to him the plaintiflPs complaint, nor even to Lukhmidass Khimjee, nor to
</p>
<p>anybody else. I never mentioned anything about this to anybody before appearing in the
</p>
<p>witness-box. I was born a Yallabhacharya, and am a Kyast. I do not at present go to
</p>
<p>any of the Maharaja's temples. I have been practising for the last three years. The
</p>
<p>plaintiff did not tell me he had prickly-heat."
</p>
<p>(12.) Lukhmidass Khimjee, examined by Mr. Dunbar.  " I deal in piece goods and
</p>
<p>am a member of the Bhattia caste. I am one of the twelve shetts of the Mahajuns. I have
</p>
<p>known the plaintiff for the last ten or eleven years. I first became acquainted at Beyt,
</p>
<p>whither I had been on a pilgrimage. Our acquaintance ripened into friendship. At Beyt,

</p>
<p>I made presents to him when I invited him to my residence. I also made presents to
</p>
<p>him on another occasion. There is a temple dedicated to Luxmijee at Beyt, where I once
</p>
<p>saw Jadunathjee Maharaj. There were females present in the temple. After throwing
</p>
<p>golal on the image, he threw it upon a number of persons, and in doing so, he pressed the
</p>
<p>breasts of a Bhattia girl about fourteen years of age. As he squeezed her breast, she
</p>
<p>smiled. He threw the golal upon the crowd, so that they might not see through it what
</p>
<p>he was doing. I used to visit him at the place where he had put up. My maternal
</p>
<p>uncle, Damodhur Dewjee, accompanied me. I went to plaintiff about one o'clock in the
</p>
<p>day, when he was in his bed. My uncle went up and shampoed one of his legs. I went
</p>
<p>up and followed his example. It is a great mark of respect to shampoo the Maharaj 's
</p>
<p>legs. The Bhattia girl above alluded to, came there with a widow, about a quarter of an
</p>
<p>hour after our arrival there. The widow whispered something into plaintiff's ears, upon
</p>
<p>143
</p>
<p>which he desired us to go out. We obeyed the order. Tlie widow came out with us and
</p>
<p>went in again. The girl was left in the bed-room. Wlien I went outside, my uncle in-
</p>
<p>formed me of the visit of the females. Afterwards, the widow came out, shut tlie door,
</p>
<p>put up the chain and held it with her hand. The girl was inside all the time. In
</p>
<p>consequence of certain conversation I had with my uncle, we both went in again to see
</p>
<p>" Kas lila" i. e., the plaintiffs conversation with the girl. We were allowed to go in the
</p>
<p>moment we expressed a wish. I saw the plaintiff having carnal connection with the girl.
</p>
<p>Several people are often anxious to see such " Eas lila." Plaintiff asked my uncle what
</p>
<p>I would pay for seeing the " Ras lila." My uncle said that I would serve him (plaintiff).
</p>
<p>I had to pay some money before I was allowed to see the " Ras lila." I was then
</p>
<p>eighteen or nineteen years old. The followers who are allowed to see the " lila," as well
</p>
<p>as the female who is defiled have to pay money for the indulgence. It is considered a pious
</p>
<p>act, and sure to lead to the paradise known as " Gowlok." I left the room shortly after-
</p>
<p>wards from shame ; my uncle remained inside. Two or three days subsequently, I saw
</p>
<p>another married Bhattia female enter the plaintiff's bed-room. When I went on a pil-
</p>
<p>grimage to Gocul Muttra at Benares about eighteen years ago, I first heard of a " Eus
</p>
<p>mundlee." I was present at " Eus mundlee" at Beyt about the time I spoke of. There
</p>
<p>were twelve or thirteen men and thirteen or fifteen females. It was held daily for some
</p>
<p>days at the appointed place. On these occasions, after the persons had taken their seats,
</p>
<p>the stories of the 84 and tlie 252 were read from a book. Some offering is then made
</p>
<p>to the book, and sweetmeat, fruit, or parched rice is placed upon the book. The sweet-
</p>
<p>meat or fruit is then distributed among the meeting The persons who are not members,
</p>
<p>and who came merely to listen to the stories, then left the room. I was a stranger at the
</p>
<p>meeting, and when I retired the men and women were in the room. I saw beds spread
</p>
<p>near each other on the floor before the lights were put out There was a heap of
</p>
<p>mattrasses which were put separately on the floor after the strangers had withdrawn. My
</p>
<p>uncle was a member, and was desired by the other members to ask me to go out. The
</p>
<p>*' Eus mundlees" are a matter of notoriety ; even a child of five years knows of its exis-
</p>
<p>tence. Their existence is notorious this way :  they read ths stories there, misinterpret
</p>
<p>them, and have connection with the v/omen. Each member must go to the meeting with
</p>
<p>his wife, except the " Varkats," who are admitted without their wives. Those followers of
</p>
<p>the Maharajas who are members of the society are reputed to be pious and staunch
</p>
<p>devotees. The Varkats are procurers of women for the Maharajas. On one occasion^
</p>
<p>plaintiff told me " the Varkats are the persons who have corrupted us, Maharajas." On

</p>
<p>another occasion at Beyt, I was sitting near the plaintiff, when a female came there. On
</p>
<p>seeing me, she was ashamed and drew her cloth partially over her face. My uncle there-
</p>
<p>fore said we would go away. I went and stood at some distance, and saw the female and
</p>
<p>the plaintiff retire into his bed-room. I saw plaintiff on three or four occasions press with
</p>
<p>his toes the hands of females who worshipped him by touching the soles of his feet.
</p>
<p>Pressing the toes is the signal for adultery. I saw plaintiff at Byculla where he had put
</p>
<p>up, the second or third day after his arrival in Bombay.
</p>
<p>144
</p>
<p>Fifteenth Day, Thursday, 20th February, 1862.
</p>
<p>Lukhmidass Khimjee, examined by Mr. Dunbar.  " On account of my having given
</p>
<p>evidence here the other day, I was abused and ill-treated by a number of Banias.
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse  'If you give the names of those persons on affidavit, the Court
</p>
<p>will take notice of the matter.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey corroborated the witness having been an eye-witness of the assault.
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse ordered it to be explained to all in Court, that it was informed of
</p>
<p>the threats and intimidation used against the witness, and that such conduct would be
</p>
<p>severely punished by fine or imprisonment, or both.
</p>
<p>Witness continued.  " I am aware of plaintiffs arrival in Bombay in 1860. I saw
</p>
<p>him two or three days after his arrival. I was in the habit of seeing him frequently,
</p>
<p>two or three times a day. I was a friend of his. I invited him to my house,
</p>
<p>introduced him to my friends, and induced them to invite him. I made him presents of
</p>
<p>furniture, lamps, chairs, sofas, &c. I know plaintiff was the editor of two pamphlets.
</p>
<p>I had a hand in getting them published. I made an arrangement with a printer
</p>
<p>named Gunput Crushnajee, for the publication of plaintiff's two pamphlets. I did so
</p>
<p>at his request. The pamphlets were edited by plaintiff : the Maharaj dictated, and
</p>
<p>Goverdhundas, his secretary, acted as his amanuensis. 1 have seen the handbill issued
</p>
<p>by plaintiff", asking the Vaishnavs to become subscribers to the pamphlet. I recom-
</p>
<p>mended him to issue a handbill to gain more subscribers ; the Maharaj dictated the
</p>
<p>contents of the handbill. Plaintiff" caused a letter to be published in the Chabook
</p>
<p>newspaper, in which there is mention made of the Walkeshwur and Byculla roads,
</p>
<p>alluded to in the libel. Plaintiff", before the action, said to me :  " All the Maharajas
</p>
<p>are running away from Bombay in consequence of publications in the newspapers, and
</p>
<p>I have therefore come down to Bombay for the purpose of discussing and debating with
</p>
<p>the editors." Pie asked me if an action would proceed during his absence from Bom-
</p>
<p>bay. I said I did not know. Kursondas Nensey, who was present on the occasion,
</p>
<p>said the action would proceed even in his absence. Plaintiff" then asked me if his evidence
</p>
<p>could be taken at his own house if he remained in Bombay. I said that that was
</p>
<p>impossible ; that Jeevunlalljee Maharaj was summoned to Court some six years ago,
</p>
<p>but that all efforts failed to obtain for him an exemption from attendance. Plaintiff*
</p>
<p>then asked whether, if he were to go to Court, he would get an elevated seat near
</p>
<p>the judge ! I subsequently came to the conclusion that the plaintiff had not left off
</p>
<p>the practices he pursued at Beyt. For a few months I was misled by his professions

</p>
<p>for the promotion of female education, widow remarriage, &c. One day whilst I was
</p>
<p>sitting at the plaintiff's temple, two females, one a married woman about 25 years of
</p>
<p>age, and the other a widow, came up. The former, when she approached the staircase,^
</p>
<p>produced a silver goblet which she had concealed under her clothes. The Maharaj, on
</p>
<p>seeing her, made her a signal, to go into his bed-room. She did not understand the
</p>
<p>signal, whereupon a female servant of the Maharaj, about 24 years of age, beckoned
</p>
<p>to her and said " come hither, Vaishnav !" Both the females then entered the
</p>
<p>bed-room. Plaintiff asked me to go and make immediate arrangements for the pub-
</p>
<p>lication of the pamphlet. I went downstairs to the veranda, but having had a suspicion
</p>
<p>145
</p>
<p>in my mind, I wont up again into the same room where I had been before. I found
</p>
<p>the widow sitting outside the door. I remained there about half an hour, when first
</p>
<p>the Maharaj came out and turned pale on observing me. I also saw the young female
</p>
<p>come out : she was smiling and laughing. I thereupon thought that plaintiff had
</p>
<p>carnal intercourse with her. She had , not the silver goblet in her hand : it must
</p>
<p>have been given to plaintiff. The widow and the young woman then left. I told
</p>
<p>plaintiff I had some business and he had better send his own man to the printer. I
</p>
<p>also left and visited plaintiff again in the evening, when he took me into an inner
</p>
<p>room for the purpose of private conversation. He opened the conversation by asking
</p>
<p>me what I had done with regard to opening female schools here. I said to him
</p>
<p>' Maharaj, this is all a sham ! you profess to be a reformer, while inwardly you
</p>
<p>commit such acts !' He denied the charge. He said he had been inside for the
</p>
<p>purpose of accepting sweetmeat or fruit. Plaintiff then adroitly changed the subject of
</p>
<p>convez'sation. On another occasion, I had conversation on the same subject with plaintiff.
</p>
<p>I said you told me that you accepted sweetmeats from female devotees openly and
</p>
<p>how it was that you went inside the other day with the young woman. Plaintiff said
</p>
<p>he did so at the desire of the woman. I then said why he kept the widow cut ;
</p>
<p>to which plaintiff made no reply. I have seen male and female devotees touching the
</p>
<p>soles of the Maharaj 's feet, and I have seen him press with his toes the hands of
</p>
<p>females, young and beautilul. About a week subsequently to what I have said above,
</p>
<p>I saw plaintiff taking some medicine. I had another conversation in the bed-room
</p>
<p>with plaintiff the same evening. He directed me not to fathom him and said ' What
</p>
<p>income do we derive from you, males ; if you make arrangements for large profits to
</p>
<p>us, I"ll undertake to root out adultery from the practices of the Maharajas.' Plaintiffs
</p>
<p>lather or grandfather having committed a theft in Oodeypore or the neighbourhood,
</p>
<p>he would not at any time be allowed to enter those territories without a pass.
</p>
<p>Plaintiff said he suffered from syphilis. I said, ' Maharaj ! I am now perfectly
</p>
<p>convinced you have not reformed your conduct as yet.' Plaintiff said do not fathom.
</p>
<p>Our income is chiefly derived from females ; if you make other arrangements for it, I
</p>
<p>will undertake to root out the practice of adultery from among the Maharajas. He
</p>
<p>said it was impossible to give up at once such practices ; but I have made some reform
</p>
<p>in my conduct. Plaintiff asked me to bring in Dr. IBhav/oo Dajee. I took Dr. Bhawoo
</p>
<p>Dajee to the plaintiffs residence. Eao Saheb Tishwanath was with us at the time. (Wit-
</p>
<p>ness describes what occurred then and in the evening.) Some days afterwards plaintiff

</p>
<p>informed me that he was under the treatment of Dr. Dhirajram. Pie became pale and
</p>
<p>sickly. I took Dr. Bhawoo Dajee to plaintiff about the middle of September I860- The
</p>
<p>general reputation of the Maharajas as regards adultery is very bad. I have personal
</p>
<p>knowledge of the Ucentious conduct of ten, twelve, or fifteen of them. After the meeting
</p>
<p>of the Bhattias in 1855, I had conversation with Jeevunjee Maharaj on the subject of the
</p>
<p>conduct of the other Maharajas. I as well as others were sent for by him. We said the
</p>
<p>printers were discussing, and he had been served with a summons. Dr. Bhawoo, Yenayek-
</p>
<p>row Wasudew, and if I mistake not ISTarayen Dinanathjee, were there. Dr. Bhawoo, said
</p>
<p>to the Maharaj* " reform your conduct, be pious, establish schools, preach to your followers,
</p>
<p>&c., and none dare publish any thing against you." It was a long lecture that Dr. Bhawoo
</p>
<p>gave : I merely give the substance. Jeevunjee said he would not be able to control the
</p>
<p>acts of the other Maharajas ; as their principal income was derived from females. Cursetjee
</p>
<p>Cama, who was present on the occasion, said a great deal to Jeevunjee Maharaj. The
</p>
<p>39
</p>
<p>146
</p>
<p>Maharaj said, " As regards myself, I am ready to give my signature to any arrangements ;
</p>
<p>I will now leave off such practices." He offered to give, but did not give his signature.
</p>
<p>Jeevunjee, on finding me on one side, accused me of, and reproved me for, divulging
</p>
<p>secret matters. No arrangement took place. I was invited to the general meeting of
</p>
<p>Yaishnavs held last year ; my consent was not taken, as it ought to have been. I discon-
</p>
<p>tinued my visits to plaintiff afterwards.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bayley.  " The plaintiff was about 28 years old when I saw
</p>
<p>him at Beyt ; he is now about 40 years of age. At that time, I considered such acts as
</p>
<p>plaintiff was guilty of, as religious. My views have changed since the " slavery bond," to
</p>
<p>which I put my signature as did several Justices of the Peace put theirs. I knew from
</p>
<p>her dress that the young female I saw at Beyt was a married woman. Plaintiff presided
</p>
<p>in the year 1860 at an exhibition for the distribution of prizes to the female schools, of
</p>
<p>Munguldass Nathoobhoy. Plaintiff expressed an opinion against the system of education,
</p>
<p>saying the girls should have been taught religious doctrines only. Venayeck Wasudewjee
</p>
<p>remonstrated against this. The subject of remarriage was talked about everywhere at the
</p>
<p>time. A meeting was convened by plaintiff to discuss the question of remarriage. It was
</p>
<p>largely attended. I discontinued going to the plaintiff on account of his bad conduct. I
</p>
<p>am not acquainted with the two females who visited the plaintiff at his residence in Bom-
</p>
<p>bay. Plaintiff is said to be a gooroo of religion, but he does not act so ; he never gives
</p>
<p>instruction. It is true he ought to do so. I signed the " slavery bond" unwillingly. By
</p>
<p>my coming here to give evidence, I have forfeited that bond. To the Court.  " I have
</p>
<p>spoken five or six years ago to my friend Mr. Dhunjeebhoy Framjee, partner in the house
</p>
<p>of Wallace & Co., about the immoral practices of plaintiff, I saw at Beyt. I had also
</p>
<p>about a year ago conversation on the same with Ivhataoo Muckunjee, Mathooradass Lowjee,
</p>
<p>and Nursey Jetta. The conversation took place in the garden house of Gokuldass Tejpal
</p>
<p>when my maternal uncle Damoder Dewjee was there. He is now at Zanzebar, I have
</p>
<p>also spoken to Mr. Munguldass Nuthoobhoy at Matheran last year."
</p>
<p>(13.) Kalabhai Lulloohhai, examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I am a Kyast, and a
</p>
<p>student of the Elphinstone Institution. I know the plaintiff whom I saw in Surat about
</p>
<p>three years ago. He was a friend of my father. I had a conversation with him on the
</p>
<p>subject of widow remarriage, I visited him frequently and saw him in different rooms in
</p>
<p>his house. I used to receive from plaintiff folded jxiwn soparee when I went to him. I
</p>
<p>was sitting one day with him on the first story when a Banya girl came in company
</p>
<p>with a female servant of the Maharaj. She was about fourteen or fifteen years. She

</p>
<p>passed across the hall into a side room, and a Banya who was sitting near us got up and
</p>
<p>went away. Plaintiff left the hall and went into the side room. The female servant sat
</p>
<p>in the hall. Pour or five females came into the hall afterwards. I went to have my
</p>
<p>usual paren soparee from plaintiff towards the side room, and on opening the door of it,
</p>
<p>saw plaintiff seated on a couch opposite the door, kissing and embracing the young woman.
</p>
<p>Plaintiff on seeing me left the female and came to the door and said ' Oh I forgot to
</p>
<p>give you the usual pawn soparee ;' so saying he came out with me and d^ired his atten-
</p>
<p>dant to get me the pawn soparee which I received and went away. Plaintiff went back
</p>
<p>to the inner room. I used to visit the plaintiff in Bombay. On one occasion, I saw two
</p>
<p>or three " chachias" sitting near plaintiff who advocated in their presence the adulterous
</p>
<p>doctrines of the sect. Plaintiff said there was no sin in adultery ; but it was wholesome
</p>
<p>and purified the blood. PTe gave an instance of the athletes of the Oaekvvar Court, who he
</p>
<p>147
</p>
<p>said kept maay concubines, and used to engage themselves in cohabiting with them before
</p>
<p>they come out for a wrestle. On another occasion when I was standing in the house yard
</p>
<p>of plaintiff's residence, two or three Vaishnavs who were speaking among themselves said,
</p>
<p>(pointing to a female) that Jadunathjee Maharaj was in love with h-r. Some days after
</p>
<p>when I did not attend the school on account of a holiday, I saw the same female passing
</p>
<p>by the Kalbadevi road. I was going on some business ; but on seeing her I followed her
</p>
<p>to plaintiffs. She went into the private room of the Maharaj and I went to the visiting
</p>
<p>room where plaintiff" was sitting. After a few minutes plaintilT followed the young woman-
</p>
<p>and I remained sitting in the visiting room. About half an hour after, he came out and
</p>
<p>I smiled at him when he asked me why I smiled. I told him you are effecting a great
</p>
<p>reform. He smiled at this and made no remark. The young woman came out after a
</p>
<p>time and went away smiling. Her dress was rufliled when she came out. From the dress
</p>
<p>and the jewels she had on, I presume she was a respectable woman. I had some conver-
</p>
<p>sation with plahitiff about the " Propagator of our own Keligion ' ; he said it was published
</p>
<p>on his behalf. One day at Surat, I saw plaintiff" refuse to i\'!ow some females to touch
</p>
<p>the soles of his feet ; and he told them to touch the feet of his wife in the zenana. He
</p>
<p>explained to me afterwards, that allowing females to touch his feet might give rise to
</p>
<p>suspicions as to his chastity. After this, while at Eombay, I saw him allowing females to
</p>
<p>touch his feet. To my knowledge, the plaintiff tells lies. His general reputation in Surat,
</p>
<p>was that he was immersed in adultery. My father is Sheristedar in the Sudder Adawlufc>
</p>
<p>at Bombay. The respect paid to the plaintiff has not diminished since the publication of
</p>
<p>the libel.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Scoble.:  " I am 16 years old, and am the nephew of Dr.
</p>
<p>Dhirajram. I am acquainted with the defendant. Plaintiff was a married man when 1
</p>
<p>saw him at Surat. I told Narmadashunker of the plaintiff's acts which I had seen.
</p>
<p>Ee-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I am sure that the female whom I followed was
</p>
<p>not the plaintiff's daughter."
</p>
<p>(14.) Curseljee Muncher/ee, examined by Mr. Dunbar.  " I am the manager of the
</p>
<p>Chabook newspaper, and know Purbhoodass, the plaintiff's secretary, who manages this case.
</p>
<p>He brought to me this hand-bill (produced in court) and a small pamphlet of " gurbees."
</p>
<p>I took the printed copies to plaintiff's residence, where I was told by a servant of tha
</p>
<p>Maharaj that the money would be paid us by Purbhoodass."

<p>n;anuscript which was brought to me by Jadunathjee's men. The proof-sheets were sent
</p>
<p>to the Maharaj's house, to one Goverdhundass. This is the written order I received for
</p>
<p>sending proofs to Goverdhundass, at the house of Jadunathjee Maharaj."
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey offered to put in the evidence and judge's notes in the " Bhattia Conspi-
</p>
<p>racy Case."
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley objected, on the ground that those proceedings did not concern the plaintifP.
</p>
<p>Islr. Anstey argued at some length that the proceedings were closely connected with
</p>
<p>this case ; there being this difference that, in the former, the plaintiff acted through his
</p>
<p>agent, and appeared now m his Tiame to seek redress. The two cases are inseparably connected.
</p>
<p>148
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice suggested the better course would be to cross-examine each witness
</p>
<p>as to whether or not he signed the " bundobust" in question. It did nor appear quite
</p>
<p>necessary to put in the record and the judge's note in that case.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey stated in reply to an enquiry made by the Court, that there were several
</p>
<p>more witnesses to be examined for the defendants.
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice remarked that, in justice to the other suitors of the Court, and with
</p>
<p>the view to save pubUc time, no more evidence which was merely corroborative of what
</p>
<p>has been already adduced, should be formally recorded, but that such ' witnesses should be
</p>
<p>only submitted to cross-examination. Witnesses as to new facts would of course be allowed
</p>
<p>to be examined.
</p>
<p>Sivtecrdh Dcvj, FridoJi, 2\st Fehniary 1862.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey gave the gist of the evidence each witness was expected to give, before
</p>
<p>calling him into Court.
</p>
<p>(16.) ChuUoorhhooj WaJjee, examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I am a Bhattia of Val-
</p>
<p>labhacharya sect. I know the plaintiff, whom I visited at his residence in Bombay.
</p>
<p>One day, a female having gone into the hall, entered an inner room. A female servant
</p>
<p>told plaintiff something in his ear, whereupon he left the hall on pretence of going to take
</p>
<p>his dinner, and entered the inner room. Plaintiff went inside, saying, I am going to dine.
</p>
<p>About half an hour after he came out. The female came out soon after him and went
</p>
<p>away. I saw no change in her dress. After a kv; minutes the Maharaj again went to dine.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bayley.  " I used to visit the plaintiff almost dally. I never
</p>
<p>saw the zenana. I had once been into the inner room, to which there is o'lly one door.
</p>
<p>I was asked to go in by the Maharaj, who wished to tell me a secret story. I
</p>
<p>presented him two or four books which he asked from me. I observed nothing in
</p>
<p>the hands of the female above alluded to. I studied for a year and a half in a school
</p>
<p>under the defendant Karsandass. I did not tell him anything about the female. I visit
</p>
<p>the great temple of Jeevunlalljee Maharaj. I had conversation with plaintiff about
</p>
<p>adultery. Kalabhai Laloobhai was present at the time. I asked plaintiff" how was it
</p>
<p>that great men committed adultery of which there is prohibition in the Shastras. To
</p>
<p>this plaintiff replied ' there is no sin in adultery ; on the contrary it gives strength
</p>
<p>to and purifies the blood of man. And I say this from my own experience.' Then
</p>
<p>he gave an instance of the athletes of the Gaekwar Court.
</p>
<p>He-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " When I went into the inner room above alluded
</p>
<p>to, I saw a bed there. The books I presented to the plaintiff' related to the Maha-

<p>rajas. They were written against the Maharajas, and I gave them to plaintiff" within the
</p>
<p>month after his arrival in Bombay."
</p>
<p>(17.)  Cursctjec Naasermavjce Cania, cross-examined by Mr. Bayley.  " I was
</p>
<p>present with some other persons at the residence of Jeevunlalljee Maharitj, when a
</p>
<p>140
</p>
<p>conversation took place. There was an understanding with me that nothing of the
</p>
<p>conversation was ever to be divulged to any one or in a court of justice. Afterwards
</p>
<p>there was a similar understandmg with Lukhmidass Gocuklass and others. I am unwilling
</p>
<p>to divulge the conversation which was confidential. I had two conversations with
</p>
<p>Jeevunjee Maharaj, on the second of which Lukhmidass was present."
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey did not wish to press the witness to divulge the conversation or the
</p>
<p>subject of it.
</p>
<p>(18.)  Damodhur Jetta, cross-examined by Mr. Bayley.  " I am a Bhattia Shrofl',
</p>
<p>and know the plaintiff, with whom I had a conversation once at the house of Kur-
</p>
<p>sondass Nensey about a year and a quarter ago. The Maharaj was sitting on a sofa,
</p>
<p>and we were sitting on the ground. The Maharaj spoke of the " Varkats." The
</p>
<p>owner asked him what was the explanation of the adultery committed by the offspring
</p>
<p>of Gosavis. He said whatever evil is committed, it is through the Varkats. He did
</p>
<p>not say he was corrupted by them. The Varkats are at present in the habit of living
</p>
<p>in other persons' houses as a matter of charity ; they commit bad acts, and go con-
</p>
<p>stantly to the Maharajas.
</p>
<p>Re-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " Kursondass Nensey is absent from Bombay : he
</p>
<p>was summoned as a witness in this case."
</p>
<p>(19.)  Munguhlass Naihoohkoy, examined by Mr Anstey.  " I am a member of the
</p>
<p>Bania caste of the Vallabacharya sect. I am a shett of my caste, a Justice of the Peace,
</p>
<p>and a grand juror. I have founded the female school. I was present on one occasion
</p>
<p>with others at the house of Jeewunjee Maharaj. Dr. Bhawoo opened the conversation on
</p>
<p>the subject of the adulteries of the Maharajas. Jeewunjee said he was unable to control
</p>
<p>the conduct and practices of all the other Maharajas. He expressed a wish to do all he
</p>
<p>could. Dr. Bhawoo remarked that, if they adopted a virtuous course of conduct, none dare /
</p>
<p>lish anything against them. At a private conversation with Jeevunjee (which witness
</p>
<p>divulged on being ordered to do so by the Court) he was informed that it was impossible
</p>
<p>to put a stop at once to the practices of the Maharajas ; their chief income was derived
</p>
<p>from females, and they could not be prevented from visiting the Maharajas, &c.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bayley.  " I invited plaintiff once to preside at an exhibition
</p>
<p>of the girl's schools at my house."
</p>
<p>(20)K}aiUano Muckunjer, examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I am a member of the
</p>
<p>Vallabhacharya sect. I am a member of the firm of Jewraz Balloo, and decide with him
</p>
<p>any disputes in the Bhattia caste. . I was present in the garden of Goculdass Tejpall about

<p>six or seven years ago. I was present at the Bhattia meeting in 1855. I remember
</p>
<p>having been present at a meeting convened by a Maharaj for the purpose of raising funds
</p>
<p>for himself. Several Maharajas ask for money when they want it, and I cannot give the
</p>
<p>particulars of any one of my visits unless the Maharaj's name is mentioned. I remon-
</p>
<p>strated with a Maharaj about the size of the gate to his temple, which could not admit
</p>
<p>men and females separately. There is at the temples a promiscuous crowd of men and
</p>
<p>women, which I consider improper. I have not observed an instance of indecency in the
</p>
<p>crowd. I have heard some immoral and indecent songs addressed by females to the
</p>
<p>MuhaiLijus, when Ihc latter are invited to their h.ouses."

</p>
<p>(^21.)  Nui\^('// Jetha, cross-examined by Mr. Biiyley.  What have you come here to
</p>
<p>prove ?
</p>
<p>Witness.  I don't know what I am to be asked.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley^Then, I wont ask you any thing.
</p>
<p>(22.)  Tliackarsey Narronjee to Mr. Anstey.  " The plaintiff has a very bad reputa-
</p>
<p>tion for his morahty and chastity in Kutch Mandavie since the last seven or eight years.
</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  " I heard that he had a bad reputation tor his adultery."
</p>
<p>(23.)  Roicjee Sitnderjee to Mr. Anstey.  " I knew the plaintiff in Kutch Manda-
</p>
<p>vie. He bore a bad character as to his morality.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Bayley.  " It is well known that all the Maharajas are bad. In Kutch I
</p>
<p>heard that the plaintiff's character was worse than that of other Maharajas. I also heard
</p>
<p>that gambling was going on in his house."
</p>
<p>(24.)  Kandass Munckarain to Mr. Anstey.  " I am Assistant Engineer in the
</p>
<p>Garrison Engineer's Department, am a native of Surat, and know the plaintiff. He bore-
</p>
<p>a bad character in Surat as to his chastity and morality.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Bayley.  " I don't think any but the over-devoted could have had a good
</p>
<p>opinion as to the plaintiff. Plaintiff was of a frolicsome character, given to play and love."
</p>
<p>To Mr. Anstey.  " I heard from those who visited the temple that plaintiff used to
</p>
<p>laugh and smile and joke and appear gay in the presence of females who went to the
</p>
<p>temple."
</p>
<p>(24.)  Janai-dan Rmnchundra to Mr. Anstey.  " I am employed in the Post Master
</p>
<p>General's Office, and am the author of a Marathee book called " Kavi Charitra," on the
</p>
<p>subject of the Vallabhacharya religion."
</p>
<p>(26.)  Narmadashunker Lalshunker to Mr. Anstey.  " I am a Naggur Brahmin,,
</p>
<p>and have taken an interest in the question of widow remarriage. I am the man who had
</p>
<p>a discussion with the plaintiff at a public meeting. lie declared himself against widow
</p>
<p>remarriage. I furnished the manuscript to the last witness for the book on the Vallabha-
</p>
<p>charya sect ; it was in reality my production. I have studied the books of the Vallabha-
</p>
<p>charya sect, and have no doubt as to the meaning of tuti, mun, and dhun ; the dedication
</p>
<p>thereof includes wives, daughters, sons, property, body, soul, &c. The plaintiff bears a bad
</p>
<p>reputation everywhere, in Surat, Mandavie, Kutch, and Bombay. I know the witness
</p>
<p>Kallabhai, who has communicated to me many things about the plaintiff.

</p>
<p>and to make them shun the society of such nasty persons as the Maharajas. I do not
</p>
<p>except Jeevunjee as being virtuous. I wrote my essay against the Vallabhacharya religion
</p>
<p>from materials furnished me by Shastrees, from books, and by the devotees themselves.
</p>
<p>The dedication of tun, mun, and dhun is addressed to the Maharajas ; I am quite sure
</p>
<p>of this from my study of several works. My version of the doctrines was a; proved
</p>
<p>of as cerrect by several Shastrees. I informed the defendant of the plaintifllis bad ciiai'acter
</p>
<p>in Surat before the publication of libel.
</p>
<p>151
</p>
<p>To Mr. Anstoy.  My compiling a dictionary 'detained me last year from going to
</p>
<p>Surat. The Shastrees who approved of my version would not like their names to be
</p>
<p>known publicly in connection with the book. There is no morality of any kind
</p>
<p>whatever in the doctrines of Yallabhacharya. The Maharajas are not preceptors of
</p>
<p>religion, much less of the ancient religion of the Hindoos."
</p>
<p>(27.)  Ramdass Bkanjee, to Mr. Anstey.  " I am a Bhattia and a member of
</p>
<p>the Yallabhacharya sect. I have previous to the publication of the alleged libel written
</p>
<p>articles in the Guzeratee newspapers against the Maharajas. I also wrote letters to the
</p>
<p>Bombay Times on the same subject. I tried to expose the adulteries and the godly
</p>
<p>pretentions of the Maharajas.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Bayley.  " I a member of the sect, though I hate some of its immoralities.
</p>
<p>The defendant never assisted me in writing those articles. I have not abused any of
</p>
<p>the Mahrrajas ; I have exposed their immoralities. I am the editor of the Khojah Dost,
</p>
<p>v/hich is the organ of the reformers in the Khojah community."
</p>
<p>(28.)  Trtbhoovandass Dicarkadass to Mr. Bayley.  " I am the first assistant teacher
</p>
<p>in the " Goculdass Tejpall Anglo-Vernacular School." The Parsee defendant came tome
</p>
<p>this morning to say that my evidence would be required in the Supreme Court :
</p>
<p>I was served with a subpoena within the last half hour. I have written articles in
</p>
<p>the Guzeratee newspapers on the conduct and character of the Maharajas. I have not
</p>
<p>visited any of the temples for the last five years, though I am a member of the
</p>
<p>Yallabhacharya sect."
</p>
<p>(29.)  Nanahkoij Pestonjee, to Mr. Anstey.  " I am the editor of the Chabook
</p>
<p>newspaper. I remember these papers (exhibits) having been brought to me by a man
</p>
<p>whose name I believe is Purbhoodass."
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley admitted the papers were taken to the Chabook newspaper by Purbhoodass,
</p>
<p>the plaintiffs alleged secretary.
</p>
<p>(30.)  Kanabhai Rustomjee to Mr. Anstey.  " I am one of the defendants in this case
</p>
<p>and managing proprietor of the TJtdon Press. I was the printer of the SaU/a
</p>
<p>Prakash newspaper, and the co-defendant was the editor. The paper was not started
</p>
<p>for profit to the proprietors, but in the cause of reform in the native community.
</p>
<p>The receipts fell far short of the expenditure. I printed some numbers of the " Pro-
</p>
<p>pagator of our own Religion" for the plaintiff. The manuscript was brought to me by
</p>
<p>his secretary Purbhoodass, who manages this case. I sent the bills to Dr. Dhirajram,
</p>
<p>who paid them on behalf of the Maharaj."

</p>
<p>The dffendants case concluded here.
</p>
<p>At Mr. Bayley's request, which was, he said, made with the view to save time,
</p>
<p>the Court allowed the case to stop for a few minutes, to enable the plaintiff's counsel
</p>
<p>to ascertain from his client whether it was desirable to call more witnesses on
</p>
<p>his behalf.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey protested against such delay as being unprecedented to his knowledge,
</p>
<p>and as it might cause an unfounded impression among the natives.
</p>
<p>152
</p>
<p>The Chief Justice said that the request was entertained wiUi a view to savfi
</p>
<p>public time ; and the Court could not stop to enquire what impression might be produced
</p>
<p>thereby.
</p>
<p>The Court adjourned, therefore, for ten minutes. On the Juilges taking their seats
</p>
<p>again, Mr. Bayley said he would proceed to examine witnesses for the plaintiff.
</p>
<p>One LalloomuU Mohtoomull was called as the first witness, when Mr. Anstey stated
</p>
<p>the witness was sitting in Court during the trial. The man denied having been
</p>
<p>present in Court. Three witnesses swore that he was present in Court during the trial,
</p>
<p>and was seen handing notes to Purbhoodass, the plaintiffs secretary.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley cited authorities to show that the power of the Court was limited to
</p>
<p>fining the witness who could not be prevented from being examined, for disobedience
</p>
<p>of an order of the Court.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey argued that the old established practice in England was the general
</p>
<p>practice of this Court, and the Judge is left no discretion to dej)art from it. The
</p>
<p>plaintiff had every opportunity to bring this evidence before ; and when it was borne
</p>
<p>in mind that the men swore falsely as to not being present in Court, when several
</p>
<p>persons were ready to swear that he was, the Court, the learned counsel trusted,
</p>
<p>would not admit the man's evidence.
</p>
<p>The Court was of opinion it had no power to object to the witness being examined.
</p>
<p>The current of judicial decisions in England has been for some years one way, that is,
</p>
<p>against rejecting the evidence of a witness. The Court had no power to exclude a
</p>
<p>witness, though he might be made subject to observations for his conduct and disobe-
</p>
<p>dience of the Court's order.
</p>
<p>" As the witness was likely to take some time in examination, the Court rose at
</p>
<p>half-past 5 p. m.
</p>
<p>At the close of the proceedings, the Chief Justice ordered the man, Lalloomull
</p>
<p>Mohtoomull, to be taken into custody by the Sheriff until next (Saturday) morning, for
</p>
<p>contempt of Court and for wilful disobedience of the Court's order."
</p>
<p>Scdenteenth Day^ Satiirdaij, 22nd February, 1862,
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey asked the Court to take a note of his objection to the reception of the
</p>
<p>evidence of witnesses who, in disobedience of the order of the Court, were in Court during
</p>
<p>the trial of the case. The learned counsel cited several cases in support of his argument,
</p>
<p>that the evidence was inadmissible.

<p>(1.) Lalloomull Mohtoomull, examined by Mr. Scoble.  " I am a Mooltanee, and a
</p>
<p>niember of the Vallabhacharya sect. I know the plaintiff, during the whole time of whose
</p>
<p>153
</p>
<p>visit at Beyt, in 19' 7, I was there. I went to visit liiin every day : he was then about
</p>
<p>23 or 24 years of age. His married wife was dead at the time. I know Lukhmidass
</p>
<p>Khimjee now ; I never saw him visit the plaintiff at Beyt. Plaintiff bore a very good reputa-
</p>
<p>tion at Beyt during that period : there were no stories current against his chastity or
</p>
<p>morality. He resided at the mansion of Jugonnathjee Maharaj. Vaishnavs used to visit the
</p>
<p>Maharaj at all times of the day when he happened to be in the house. He had a retinue
</p>
<p>of ten or twelve servants, but had no Varkats with him. He had with him a Bhattia of
</p>
<p>Mandavie. There are several temples at Beyt, one of which is that of Luxmijee. The
</p>
<p>room in which the image is placed is about ten or twelve feet square. There is an outer
</p>
<p>court to this shrine. A tax of one coree and two cents is levied by the officers of the
</p>
<p>Graekwar Sirkar on all persons who visit the temple of Luxmijee. Jadoonathjee arrived at
</p>
<p>Beyt in the month of February, and the festival of Vussunt Punchmee occurred three or
</p>
<p>four days afterwards. During this festival golal is thrown on the image. It is not usual
</p>
<p>at the temple of Luxmijee to throw golal on the Vaishnavs. In three of the thirteen tem-
</p>
<p>ples at Beyt it is customary daily to throw golal on the persons of the Vaishnavs. In the
</p>
<p>other temples, with the exception of Fagan-wud the 1st, no golal is thrown on the
</p>
<p>worshippers. I deal in golal, piece goods, &c., at Beyt. On occasions when the Maharaj
</p>
<p>throws golal on the image at the temple of Luxmijee, he is surrounded by the priests of
</p>
<p>four other temples := women and men accommodated separately inside the temple. In the
</p>
<p>court-yard there is a promiscuous crowd of males and females. The thirteen temples are
</p>
<p>under the guidance of persons belonging to four " gaddees" or seats. The Gaekwar's men
</p>
<p>keep order at the temples at the time of worship. There is one officiating priest at the
</p>
<p>temple of Luxmijee, and four sepoys maintain order there during worship. AH the temples
</p>
<p>at Beyt belong to the Vallabhacharyas. The images are worshipped from outside the
</p>
<p>temple unless the tax is paid. The Maharaj makes a circuit of all the temples twice a
</p>
<p>day, in less than half an hour. I never heard of a " Rus mundlee" at Be^t : I read of
</p>
<p>it here in the newspapers."
</p>
<p>In the cross-examination by Mr. Anstey, the witness, after shuffling a good deal
</p>
<p>admitted that the witnesses who swore on Friday to having seen him in court, swore to
</p>
<p>the truth.
</p>
<p>Re-examined by Mr. Scoble.  " I believe conscientiously that I did not come into Court."
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould.  Now, what reliance can you expect to be placed on the state-
</p>
<p>ments of this man ? As far as I am concerned, I cannot attach any weight lo what he says.

</p>
<p>tiff, whom I saw at Dwarka, and invited him to my house on the occasion of my daughter's
</p>
<p>marriage. For chastity and morality, the plaintiff bore a good character. I heard no
</p>
<p>stories against him. He remained my guest for four or five days : I kept him in a
</p>
<p>separate house, a dhurmsalla, which was not distant from my house so much as half a
</p>
<p>mile. I saw or heard nothing against him. Of the thirteen shrines at Beyt, seven,
</p>
<p>including the temple of Luxmijee, are in charge of the Gaekwar, and to each is attached a
</p>
<p>choubdar. I have never seen golal thrown on the worshippers at the temple of Luxmee ;
</p>
<p>never heard at Beyt of the existence of the " Rus mundlee :" if I did, I should have
</p>
<p>punished the members of it. I came to understand its nature through the Gujeratee
</p>
<p>inewflpapers of Bombay. I know nothing at all about " Rus mundlees."

</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I was ordered into custody by the Gaekwar for
</p>
<p>three years, for having apprehended robbers in a foreign territory. Major Shortt reported
</p>
<p>against me, after having tried me. He did not fine me five thousand rupees. "During the
</p>
<p>three years of my custody, I was not able to go to the temples. I subscribed to the
</p>
<p>Parses Reformer, which contained articles abusive of the Maharajas. All I mean to say
</p>
<p>is that I have  not seen golal thrown at the temple of Luxmee ; I do not know if it is
</p>
<p>thrown there. There are only six temples at Beyt under the control of the Gaekowar. Five
</p>
<p>of them are covered over with a roof The court-yard of Luxmijee's temple is also covered
</p>
<p>over with a roof ; it looks like a house.

<p>To Mr. Scoble.  " I was not tried by Major Shortt, the Resident.
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  I did not appear personally before Major Shortt ; my man used

<p>to go to him during the enquiry."
</p>
<p>(3.)  Meetaram Pursotum, examined by Mr. Scoble.  " I know the plaintiff, whom
</p>
<p>I saw at Beyt in 1907. I was a clerk of the Coomavisdar's mehta, and was sent to the
</p>
<p>Maharajas who came to Beyt. I was sent to plaintiff, and used to accompany him when
</p>
<p>he visited the temples. He had put up at the house of Dwarkanathjee, and bore a good
</p>
<p>character as to chastity during his residence there. I used to attend him with four sepoys
</p>
<p>whenever he visited the temples. I never noticed any thing improper in his conduct,
</p>
<p>though I stood close by him on such occasions. I have not heard of the existence of
</p>
<p>' Kus mundlees.'
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I first heard the name of " Eus mundlee" when
</p>
<p>the counsel mentioned it just now. The mansion of Dwarkanathjee is the same as that of
</p>
<p>Jugoonathjee. Jadoonathjee was the only officiating Maharaj at Beyt during the seven months
</p>
<p>I was with him. Vallubhjee Maharaj was not ut Beyt at that time ; I never heard anything
</p>
<p>up to this day against the plaintiff's character. I did not know him at any other place
</p>
<p>except Beyt. I came to Bombay fifteen days ago : I heard today in Court that the
</p>
<p>plaintiff had been charged with adultery. I saw the last witness in Court this day : he
</p>
<p>was not Coomavisdar at Beyt during the time I was there. I would have disobeyed the
</p>
<p>Maharaj if he asked me to leave him alone at the temples even for a few minutes.
</p>
<p>There were the Sircar's sepoys at his house ; they would not have left him by his order.
</p>
<p>Re-examined by Mr. Scoble.  " It is since my arrival from Eajcote that I heard of
</p>
<p>the plaintiff's adultery, as alleged in the newspapers. While at the temples, the Maharaj
</p>
<p>never asked me to go out. The sepoys followed the Maharaj from room to room, and
</p>
<p>wherever he went. He slept in the store-room : he was attended by sepoys even in his

</p>
<p>not leave him even though he desired them to do so.
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  " The plaintiff was at Beyt in the month of February, and
</p>
<p>remained there ten or twelve days. I saw golal thrown in the temple of Dwarkanathjee
</p>
<p>during the time the plaintiff was at Beyt. In no other temple is golal thrown about.
</p>
<p>The Maharaj and the Brahmacharyas throw about golal on the persons of the Vaishnavs.
</p>
<p>Females and males, who pay a tax of nearly half a rupee are allowed to touch the feet
</p>
<p>of the idol.

<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  " If the Maharaj be present, the devotees pay him the
</p>
<p>" durshun" after the image."
</p>
<p>(4.)  Raghowjee Natlia, examined by ]Mr. Scoble.  " I am a Bhattia of tlie Vallabh-
</p>
<p>charya sect. I have a Maharaj for my gooroo. I saw the plaintiff at Beyt in the
</p>
<p>month of February 1851. On the day I arrived in Beyt, the Maharaj left for Dvvarka.
</p>
<p>While I was at Beyt, the Maharaj returned from Dwarka, and remained ten or twelve
</p>
<p>days. I visited the plaintiff frequently to make " durshun." I heard or saw nothing
</p>
<p>prejudicial to his morality either during his residence in or absence from Beyt.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I was at Beyt on a pilgrimage. I am quite sure
</p>
<p>I was not in Bombay at the time doing my business as a Broker. It is a sin to
</p>
<p>come and give evidence in this Court against the Maharaj or to divulge his secrets.
</p>
<p>I did not sign the " bundobust" against giving evidence here, whilst in Kutch.
</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  " If Mathooradas l^owjee gave evidence against the
</p>
<p>Maharaj, he committed a sin. The whole world would say so ; even the Mahomedans !
</p>
<p>Witness is fined twenty rupees for not giving a direct answer to Sir M. Sausse.
</p>
<p>To Sir ^I. Sause.  " I heard that there was a meeting of the Mahajuns held in
</p>
<p>Bombay.
</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  " If there be anything bad against the Maharaj, I
</p>
<p>would tell it in Court.
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sause.  " I think the Maharaj would never do anything bad. lie is
</p>
<p>our gooroo, and all the women are like his daughters."
</p>
<p>(5.)  Preinjee Poonja, examined by Mr. Scoble.  " I am a Pocurna Brahmin,
</p>
<p>and have served in the temple of Radhajee at Beyt for fifteen or twenty years. I
</p>
<p>have known the plaintiff since he visited Beyt ten or twelve years ago, about the
</p>
<p>month of February or March. He visited the temple of Radhajee twice a day, always
</p>
<p>accompanied by his attendants. I observed no improper or indecent conduct on the
</p>
<p>part of the plaintiff or the female worshippers in the temple. I heard no reports
</p>
<p>against him. It is not usual in our temple to throw golal on the followers upon any
</p>
<p>occasion ; in our temple, as well as in the temple of Luxmijee, golal is thrown only
</p>
<p>upon the image. In the temple of Dvvarkanathjee, golal is thrown upon the musicians
</p>
<p>after the priests have throvm it upon the image. So far as my information extended,
</p>
<p>the plaintiff bore a very good reputation as to chastity.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anesty.  " I have not heard any report against Jadunath-
</p>
<p>jee's chastity up to this day. I am a follower of Runchorjee Maharaj of Mandavie ;

<p>his chastity or morality whilst I was in Surat, nor since I have come to Bombay.
</p>
<p>I visited him in Bombay but saw nothing improper in his conduct.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I have never up to this day heard anything
</p>
<p>against the plaintiff's moral character, except that I was told three or four months ago
</p>
<p>that he was charged with immoral conduct in a newspaper. I heard that a meeting of

</p>
<p>member of the Vallabhacharya sect. " I have been a resident of Surat for many
</p>
<p>years, and know the plaintiff. In Surat I have heard he bore a good character as
</p>
<p>regards cliastity. I heard that tlie newspapers here charged him with a great crime
</p>
<p>which he committed in Surat.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I never heard anything against plaintiff" either
</p>
<p>here or in Surat. I came here four or five months ago, when I heard that the
</p>
<p>newspapers charged the plaintiff' with immorality. I don't know if it is right or wrong
</p>
<p>that one should offer his wife to the Maharaj. I consider the Maharaj as my God,
</p>
<p>and It would be a sin to give any evidence against him.
</p>
<p>Re-examined by Mr. Bayley.  " My respect for the Maharaj would not induce me
</p>
<p>to tell lies in Court. If I knew anything against him I would tell it.
</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  " I do not know if the Maharaj can do anything wrong.
</p>
<p>It would be improper in him to do an immoral act."

<p>and am the mooneeta of the firm of Kamdass Purshotumdass. I know the plaintiff, who
</p>
<p>bore a good character for chastity and morality. I have not heard any bad reports
</p>
<p>against him.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I get no letters from Surat except those con-
</p>
<p>nected with the business of our firm. I have been in Bombay for twenty-five or
</p>
<p>thirty years. I used to visit the plaintiff in Bombay. I did not hear before this
</p>
<p>action was brought that he was charged with immorality. Since the last two or three
</p>
<p>years I have heard rumours of the immorality of the Maharajas. I have never heard
</p>
<p>till this moment of the existence of the " Eus mundlees." I have drunk the water
</p>
<p>which is distributed to the devotees in the temples. A gooroo would not commit a
</p>
<p>sinful act.

<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  " If a trustworthy person told me that the Maharaj committed

<p>a bad act, I would believe it."

<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ajistey.  " Jadoonathjee told me that he had opened the

<p>(10.)  Morarbhoy Vijbhookhundass, examined by Mr. Scoble.  " I am a Bania shroff"

<p>carrying on business between Bombay and Surat. I was the man who, on the day of
</p>
<p>the Royal Proclamation of 1858, released all the debtors in the Surat jail, by paying their
</p>
<p>debts. I know the plaintiff", who bore a good character for chastity and morality. I have
</p>
<p>heard no report against his morality, either in Surat or in Bombay. I have seen nothing
</p>
<p>157
</p>
<p>to diminish my respect towards the pLaintiff. On my last visit to Surat, I did not hear
</p>
<p>that he had established a school there.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I have not heard any thing against plaintiff or any
</p>
<p>of the other Maharajas as to their chastity. I never stated in the shop of Eduljee Framjee

<p>(11.)  Munshookhratn Khooskaldass, examined by Mr. Bayley.  " I am a moomeyn of

</p>
<p>resided in Surat for four years, and knew the plaintiff in that city. I am a member of
</p>
<p>the Vallabhacharya sect. I went to the plaintiff almost daily for " durshun." He bore a
</p>
<p>good reputation for chastity and morality. I heard no gup or rumours against him ; I
</p>
<p>should have heard of it if any existed. I have seen him in Bombay.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I do not remember Jadoonathjee going to Beyt
</p>
<p>whilst 1 was at Surat. I never heard a rumour against this or any other Maharaj until
</p>
<p>a few days since this trial began."
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould. Will you call the Maharaj, Mr. Bayley ?

<p>]Mr. Bayley.  I should call him if I think necessary. I am not called upon to pledge

<p>year. I knew the plaintiff" at Surat. I am a member of the Vallabhacharya sect. I

<p>his character.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I went once a year to Surat. I do not consider

<p>it a sin to tell the truth against a gooroo. To-day is the first time I hear anything

</p>
<p>whose father I went once a day to make " durshun." To my knowledge, the plaintiffs

<p>character for morality was good. I did not hear any reports against him. I know he
</p>
<p>has established a school in Surat ; and I have heard that he pays its expenses. It

<p>He left Surat about November last to come to Bombay. I heard about a year ago

<p>that some newspapers in Bombay and Surat published certain charges against his character.
</p>
<p>Never before that had 1 heard any rumour against any of the Afaharajas.

<p>158
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  " One may spread a rumour against the character of a Maharaj,
</p>
<p>but I should not be satisfied with it. The Maharaj would not commit a bad act, by
</p>
<p>which I mean anything contrary to rehgion. The religion is contained in the books ot
</p>
<p>the Vallabhacharya sect. I would consider it a bad act if one offered his wife to the
</p>
<p>Maharaj, &c., even though it may be enjoined by the religious books."

<p>(14.) Bhookhniidass Kishordass, examined by Mr. Bayley.  " I am in the service of

<p>Nusserwanjee Bomanjee Bhownugria of Surat, and came to Bombay about a year ago.
</p>
<p>I am a member of the Vallabhacharya sect, and know the plaintiff, whom I saw very
</p>
<p>frequently at Surat. He is my gooroo. He bore a very good character for chastity and
</p>
<p>morality. I heard no bad report against him.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I cannot say whether or not the plaintiff had
</p>
<p>to leave Surat for some years by reason of the ill-will of the inhabitants towards him,
</p>
<p>in consequence of a bad act committed by him. I am bound to him by the " muntra"
</p>
<p>(incantation) administered to me by his fathers. I do not consider it a sin to tell
</p>
<p>the truth against a Maharaj. I never told a lie in my life. I do not regard my gooroo
</p>
<p>as god. It is not possible that the Maharaj would do a bad act. Until a month or
</p>
<p>two ago, I never heaid a report against any one of the ^laharajas"

<p>of Manockjee Bomonjee, Oursetjee Cama and Co. I know the plaintiff, who is my gooroo.
</p>
<p>I knew him for several years at Surat, where he bore a good character for chastity

<p>and morality I never saw any impropriety on his part at the temple.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I do not know the age of the plaintiff. We swing
</p>
<p>the image ; I cannot say if the Maharaj is ever swung in a swing. I do not regard
</p>
<p>my gooroo as an incarnation of God. I have seen golal sprinkled on the image in the
</p>
<p>temple. The plaintiff left Surat in 1851, but I do not exactly remember whether he
</p>
<p>stayed away five or seven years. I heard no report in Surat against any one of the
</p>
<p>Maharajas. I heard rumours in Bombay about two or three months ago, as alleged in
</p>
<p>the newspapers.
</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  " I never heard that any Bhattia shetts were punished
</p>
<p>coming to a resolution not to give evidence against the Maharaj. I simply heard that
</p>
<p>some Bhattias were litigating and were punished.
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  " The Maharajas being gooroos, their conduct would never be bad.
</p>
<p>I would not believe a bad report against a Maharaj, for he would not commit a bad

</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse suggested, with a view to economize time, that any further witnesses,
</p>
<p>whose evidence was in effect similar to that already given had better be simply submited
</p>
<p>to cross-examination, as was done in some instances with the witnesses for the defendants.
</p>
<p>(16.) Ka7idass Doolubhdass, cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I heard no bad report
</p>
<p>whatever against the plaintiff" in Surat. He is my gooroo. According to my religion,
</p>
<p>liis good conduct must be told, but nothing must be said of his bad conduct as a

<p>1848 or 1849 : he resided there five or six months, during which time I went to him
</p>
<p>every second or third day to make " durshun." He bore a good character for chastity
</p>
<p>and morality. I heard no report against him.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  "I never heard in Ahmedabad of the elopement of
</p>
<p>a Maharaj with a young Brahmin female to Baroda. The first time I heard anything
</p>
<p>against a Maharaj was three or four months ago, through the newspapers. I have been

<p>(18.) Bhoijchund Kaivul, examined by Mr. Bayley.  " I come from Ahmedabad, and

<p>have been frequenting Bombay for the last three or four years. I saw the plaintiff at
</p>
<p>Ahmedabad in 1848 or 1849, and went to him once or twice a day to make " durshun."
</p>
<p>He bore a very good character for chastity and morality. I did not hear any report
</p>
<p>against him.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Anstey.  " I heard only two months ago bad reports against the plaintiff
</p>
<p>through the newspapers. I never heard before this a bad report against any one of
</p>
<p>the Maharajas. My Maharaj has not carried off any Brahmin lady ; I do not know
</p>
<p>anything else. I belong to the Vallabhacharya sect. I heard that the temples were
</p>
<p>closed for eight or nine days in 1859. I did not sign the " bundobust" on account
</p>
<p>of which they were closed. I heard of the Bhattia Conspiracy Case on my return from
</p>
<p>Ahmedabad. We regard ths Maharaj in the place of God, but he is my gooroo. I
</p>
<p>regard him as an incarnation of God : and if he chooses, he can commit a sin. If
</p>
<p>he commits a sin, God will punish him. I would tell the truth even of a gooroo.
</p>
<p>Five or six years ago, the Maharaj told me to make " durshun" and to take the name
</p>
<p>of God. ]\Iy .Maharaj is Kanyalaljee who is at present in Kotah.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Bayley.  I regard the Maharaj the same as the image, but less than Thakorjee.
</p>
<p>I regard Thackorji as God."

<p>member of the Vallabhacharya sect. I am a Mehta to a shroff, in Bombay. Until the
</p>
<p>last two months I was in Baroda, where I saw the plaintiff for about three months.

</p>
<p>elephants, &c., to welcome him. The plaintiff bore a good reputation in Baroda as regards
</p>
<p>his chastity and morality.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Anstey.  " The Gackwar is a Mahratta ; I don't know of what caste
</p>
<p>he is. The Gaekwar is a follower of all rehgions, and respects everybody. It is true
</p>
<p>that he built a mosque some days ago, and, to please a Mahomedan fakeer caused all
</p>
<p>the hogs in Baroda to be killed at once. I never heard of the touching loves of Val-
</p>
<p>lubhjee Maharaj and Tara, a Mahomedan female."

<p>(20.) Mansookhram Nurrotum, examined by Mr. Bayley.  " I came to Bombay
</p>
<p>from Baroda seventeen years ago, and have frequently gone to the latter place on business.
</p>
<p>I saw the plaintiff at Baroda in 1904, and so far as I heard, he bore a good character
</p>
<p>for chastity and morality. I heard no bad report against him. I am a Bhattia by
</p>
<p>caste. The Bhattias of Baroda do not wear the same sort of dress as those of Bombay.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Anstey.  " I heard people talk of the Bhattia Conspiracy trial ; I don't
</p>
<p>know what the charge was in that case. Being a resident of Guzerat, I would not
</p>
<p>understand the language and manners of the Bombay Bhattias, and therefore would not
</p>
<p>have attended the Bhattia meeting, of 1855. There is no harm in telling lies for a
</p>
<p>good object. To save a Brahmin charged with murder, I would not tell a lie. I would
</p>
<p>not tell an untruth for even a good object. I consider my gooroo as an incarnation of
</p>
<p>God, and accordingly bow to him. The Maharaj would not commit sin.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Bayley.  " I had never my attention pointed to such questions as the
</p>
<p>incarnation of God, &c. I consider the Maharaj inferior to the Thackorjee : he is so
</p>
<p>regarded by all Vaishnavs."
</p>
<p>(21.) Purshotum Permanund, examined by Mr. Scoble.  " I am a Bania merchant
</p>
<p>of Baroda, and at present ship goods from Bombay. I saw the plaintiff" in Baroda in
</p>
<p>1904 : he bore a good character for morality. I observed no impropriety of conduct
</p>
<p>on the part of the plaintiff" in the temple at Baroda during the time of worship.
</p>
<p>To Mr. An3tey.  " We were very glad when the Maharaj came to our city and
</p>
<p>aff"orded us an opportunity of making " durshun." Our females and we all were very
</p>
<p>glad when he came and resided amongst us. I heard nothing against any one of the

<p>Maharajas before this action was brought. ^

<p>To Mr. Scoble.  " How can I say whether or not it is a calumny on my sect, to
</p>
<p>say that any of its members off"er their wives to the Maharajas. Nobody off"ers his
</p>
<p>wife to the Maharaj ; it is false."
</p>
<p>(22.) Nanahhoy Dayabhoy, examined by Mr. Bailey.  " I am a resident of Surat
</p>
<p>I know the plaintiff" from his infancy. I was at Shree Gocul Muthra when he came
</p>
<p>there on a pilgrimage in 1903. I arrived there when he was there : we remained
</p>
<p>there for about a month. I accompanied him to Buldewjee, and travelled with him
</p>
<p>for about a month. I used to be in his company when he visitd the temples. He
</p>
<p>bore a good character for chastity and morality at those places. There were some
</p>
<p>forty or fifty people who formed his retinue, and whose expenses were defrayed by
</p>
<p>him. I heard no stories against his morality.

<p>To Mr. Anstey.  " I was not with the plaintiff" at Oodeypore. I don't know if he
</p>
<p>was prevented from touching the image in the temple there. On the pilgrimage, fe-
</p>
<p>males used to visit him for " durshun" and touched his feet. He never presses with
</p>
<p>his toes the hands of females. It is the custom to touch the teet, not from below,
</p>
<p>but at the top. I did not laugh when you asked me of the cause which led plain-
</p>
<p>tiff" to leave Surat.
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph A mould,  O yes, you did.
</p>
<p>161
</p>
<p>Witness to Mr. Anstey.  ' I simply heard that some Bhattias were fined in this
</p>
<p>Court for holding a caste meeting ; not for making a " bundobust" against giving evi-
</p>
<p>dence in this case."
</p>
<p>(23.) Lalljee Natha was called as the next witness, when Mr. Anstey stated he
</p>
<p>was observed sitting in Court during the trial.
</p>
<p>Lalljee admitted he was sitting in Court one day.
</p>
<p>Examined by Mr. Scoble. " I met the plaintiff on a pilgrimage at Gocul Muthra a-
</p>
<p>bout four or five years ago, and was with him for about a month and a half He
</p>
<p>had a hundred or a hundred and fifty servants with him. His tent was pitched at
</p>
<p>some distance from that of his servants. The Vaishnavs, about a thousand in num-
</p>
<p>ber, followed him in a procession from place to place. He bore a good character for
</p>
<p>morality, and I heard no report against him.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I was in Court during the examination of Drs.
</p>
<p>Bhawoo Dajee and Dhirajram. I did not sit in Court on any other day.
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould.  If I mistake not, I saw this man in Court certainly for more
</p>
<p>than one day.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey.  There are several persons who observed him.
</p>
<p>Witness to Mr. ^instey.  " I have signed the " bundobust" made at the Bhattia
</p>
<p>meeting. I know eight persons were punished for making that " bundobust" which I
</p>
<p>signed because the whole of my caste signed it. I did not sign the " slavery bond"
</p>
<p>three years ago. I know the temples were closed for eight or nine days. I do not
</p>
<p>know if I was caricatured in the Bagai Naskeat newspaper as a member of the
</p>
<p>" Rus mundlee." I don't know of a society of which Dayalbhoy is the chief : I
</p>
<p>know Dayalbhoy. By " Rus mundlee" I mean a dramatic representation of Thackorjee.
</p>
<p>My partner's name is Muckonjee ; I don't know of what society he is the principal
</p>
<p>member.
</p>
<p>Witness to Mr. Scoble.  " I did not understand anything of the evidence given by
</p>
<p>the doctors in English, whilst I was in Court. I did not hear the Crier give the
</p>
<p>order that day for witnesses to retire. I think it was this book (produced in Court)
</p>
<p>in which I signed my name. [It refers to the celebrated " bundobust" made at the
</p>
<p>Bhattia meeting.]
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey objected to the book being tendered in evidence, on the ground that it
</p>
<p>was not though demanded, produced at the trial of the Bhattia Conspiracy Case, that
</p>
<p>the learned Puisne Judge's notes in that case would show that the " bundobust" was

</p>
<p>not wholly reduced to writing ; and that the judge's notes were not admitted.
</p>
<p>Mr. Scoble argued that he had a right to put in the book through the first wit-
</p>
<p>ness, who admitted having signed it, and particularly because the device was resorted
</p>
<p>to, to prejudice the mind of the Court against every Bhattia witness in this case by
</p>
<p>constant referrence to an unlawful " bundobust," which never existed, as the book would
</p>
<p>show.
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse remarked that the book might be referred to as containing the " bundo-
</p>
<p>21
</p>
<p>162
</p>
<p>bust which the witness signed ; and Mr. Anstey would be allowed to cross-examine
</p>
<p>lum.
</p>
<p>Witness to Mr, Scoble.  " The " bundobust" in this book was read to the meeting
</p>
<p>before it was signed by myself and others. There was no supplementary " bundobust,"
</p>
<p>nor have I signed any.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey was addressing the Court at some length against the admission of the
</p>
<p>book, complaining that there was no official translation to enable him to cross-examine
</p>
<p>the witness, when
</p>
<p>Mr. Bayley said it was not tendered or put In, as the official translation was miss-
</p>
<p>ing and another copy was being prepared in the Translator's office.
</p>
<p>Witness to Mr. Anstey.  " I saw Arrut Kirpal, one of the conspirators, reading from
</p>
<p>the book and giving explanations. I did not notice that the sense of the meeting was
</p>
<p>taken with referrence to certain resolutions. I did not hear persons shout out " We
</p>
<p>will do it, we will do it." Canjee Samjee also addressed the meeting holding a pa-
</p>
<p>per in his hand, the contents of which I did not read or hear.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Bayley.  " I did not sign any other " bundobust" but this, nor was I ask-
</p>
<p>ed to sign any.
</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  " My object in signing this book was not to assist any
</p>
<p>body ; it was because the editors of the newspapers had published something about per-
</p>
<p>sons offering their wives to the Maharajas. Those did not offer their wives were ask-
</p>
<p>ed to sign the book ; those who did offer, were told not to sign.
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  " I was not aware that witnesses in this case were ordered not
</p>
<p>to sit in Court. Before the day on which I came into Court, I had been sitting
</p>
<p>outside four or five days. I have received a subpoena in this case."
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse.  The Court has no doubt that the witness was perfectly aware of
</p>
<p>the order, and sat there in contempt of the Court's order. The Court therefore fines
</p>
<p>him twenty-five rupees.
</p>
<p>(24.) Nandoo Jadhowjee, examined by Mr. Bayley.  " I am a Bhattia, and serve
</p>
<p>as a muccadum. In the year 1903, when I left Muthra on a tour, I was in plain-
</p>
<p>tiflTo company for about a month and a half I use to go about in the jungles : it
</p>
<p>is our religion to visit rivers, tanks, &c. I did so with plaintiff and with about eight
</p>
<p>hundred other persons. He had a separate suite of tents. He bore a good character
</p>
<p>for chastity and morality, I have not heard anything against him.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I was present at the Bhattia meeting held on

</p>
<p>the 6th September last. I am not aware of any resolutions being passed thereat. I
</p>
<p>cannot say that the witness (for the prosecution) at the Bhattia Conspiracy Case swore
</p>
<p>to anything but the truth. At the meeting, I signed In a book. Arrut Kirpal
</p>
<p>read from a book and gave explanations, of which I heard one word. On the day
</p>
<p>of the meeting, I went with one Madhowjee to the house of Jewraz Balloo, where
</p>
<p>Goculdass Tejpall said to us that the adulteries of the Maharajas ought to be put a
</p>
<p>stop to. I said it was a matter for the Shettlas to settle or make arrangements
</p>
<p>about it. I heard about four years ago of charges against the Maharajas through the
</p>
<p>163
</p>
<p>newspapers. I never in my life saw an instance of impropriety on the part of any
</p>
<p>one of the Maharajas.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Bayley.  " I heard a person crying out at the meeting, " If you send
</p>
<p>your wives and daughters to the Maharajas, then do not sign ; but if you do not send
</p>
<p>them sign." Thereupon I signed."
</p>
<p>Nineteenth Day, Tuesday 25tk February, 1862.
</p>
<p>(25.) Bhimjee Purshotam, examined by Mr. Bayley.  " I was present at the
</p>
<p>Bhattia meeting held in 1855. I remember that a portion of the resolutions, was that
</p>
<p>Bhattia women should not go about in their Garries without " purdas" or screens. It
</p>
<p>was also resolved that the women should not sit in the roads on the occasion of any
</p>
<p>deaths in the caste ; also that they should attend early at the general caste dinner, &c.
</p>
<p>It was also proposed to prevent women from going astray on the pretence of visiting
</p>
<p>the Maharaja's temples ; but that proposition was not acted upon. I am one of the
</p>
<p>twelve Shetts of the Halayee caste of Bhattias. I have seen a " Ras mundlee," a dramatic
</p>
<p>performance by the inhabitants of a village near Gocul Muthra. The performers are
</p>
<p>Brahmins ; some of them are at present in Bombay. I don't know what is meant by
</p>
<p>" Rus mundlee."
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " I was present in Court during part of the exami-
</p>
<p>nation of Mathooradass Lowjee. I was summoned last Saturday (the summons is dated
</p>
<p>23rd January last). I signed the " bundobust" in September last. It was not to the
</p>
<p>effect that it was better to give false evidence to the Court rather than that the Maharaj
</p>
<p>should lose the action. I did not agree to any such arrangement. I went to the Hon'ble
</p>
<p>Mr. Westropp to ask him to take in hand the Maharaj 's case ; but he said he had the
</p>
<p>Governor's business in hand and had no time. I went to the Bhattia meeting of Septem-
</p>
<p>ber last about three hours after the business commenced. I am a resident of Porebunder,
</p>
<p>and believe a copy of the " bundobust" was sent for signatures there. I regard the
</p>
<p>Maharaj simply as a gooroo.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Bayley.  " A false charge was brought against me by some Subedars, but
</p>
<p>the prosecution was abandoned."
</p>
<p>Mr. Scoble put in the book of " bundobust," with the official translation, in connection
</p>
<p>with the evidence of Lalljee Natha.
</p>
<p>Shri Nathjee is true.
</p>
<p>"We the undersigned, all the Vaishnavs wearing the Kanthe* have jomtly made this
</p>
<p>writing. The reason is as follows :  For some time past, most unmoral calumnies have

</p>
<p>been published in the newspapers, against our religion, and our Guru, and our reputation.
</p>
<p>Our Maharaj Shri Vallabhacharyajee has composed a work (called) Sidhant Eahasya, and
</p>
<p>Bramhsamund, Shri Gocalnathji has made commentaries on this work, to enable us
</p>
<p>* A sacred uecklace worn by the Vaishnavs.
</p>
<p>164
</p>
<p>to understand it. Most of the Vaishnavs have most Hkely 'read these commentaries.
</p>
<p>But the meaning of those commentaries has now been reversed, and published to the
</p>
<p>effect, that one should make over even one's lawful wife to the Gosaiji Maharaj
</p>
<p>befose one has enjoyed (her) that one's sons and daughters also should be made over
</p>
<p>to them, that after one has married (a wife), and before he has enjoyed (her)
</p>
<p>one should make her over to Gosaiji Maharaj, after which, one should take (her)
</p>
<p>for one's own use, that to this effect Shri Goculnathji has made the commentaries, and that
</p>
<p>in the same manner, the Maharajas enjoy at present, the virgin and maiden daughters and
</p>
<p>daughters-in-law of their devotees. In this way a false rendering has been published.
</p>
<p>Therefor^-, any person, who may have been convinced ia his mind, that this published
</p>
<p>account is true, should not put his signature to this writing. But it is resolved, that such
</p>
<p>persons only should put their signatures to this writing, as have been convinced in their
</p>
<p>minds, upon their true faith, that the publishers have falsely published these accounts.
</p>
<p>Because, these acco'mts of our religion have been published in a very improper way, and
</p>
<p>a very great slur has been cast on the character of all the Vaishnavs, the publishers thereof
</p>
<p>and his abettors will be asked (about them,) according to the rules (or law). Therefore
</p>
<p>this writing has been made, in order to make arrangements (or to adopt measures) respect-
</p>
<p>ing the same, in some way or other, and to protect our religion and our religious pieceptors
</p>
<p>and our preceptors' reputation. Therefore such persons, as may believe their religion to be
</p>
<p>true, should put their signatures to this writing. This writing, which has been made by
</p>
<p>us with our free will and pleasure, and in our sound sense and understanding has truly
</p>
<p>been agreed to by us the undersigned, in our true faith. S. 1917 Bhadarva Sud the 2nd
</p>
<p>the day of the Friday. The 6th day of September 1861.
</p>
<p>(26) Damodhur Madhowjee, examined by Mr. Scoble.  " 1 am one of the Shettiasof
</p>
<p>the Bhattia caste, and carry on no business at present. I was present at the Bhattia
</p>
<p>meeting of last year, at which something was read out from a book. I don't recollect
</p>
<p>whether I was present at the Bhattia meeting of 1855.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Anstey.  " I am related to Lukhmidass Damjee, one of the conspirators. I
</p>
<p>signed letters sent to Porebunder and other places, calling upon all true Vallabhacharyas to
</p>
<p>join the Bhattia meeting in supporting the religion of the sect against the libels published in the
</p>
<p>newspapers. Those who did not sign we would not have considered as members of our sect. I
</p>
<p>remember an action on the Plea side of this Court brought against a Maharaj by
</p>
<p>one Maneckbaee. She paid Rs. 1600 to the Maharaj, and the case was compromised.

<p>been purchased by Jeevunjee Maharaj. I sent a man to Goculdass Tejpall and
</p>
<p>Lukmidass Khimjee to ask their permission to hold the meeting in September last.
</p>
<p>They replied that they would not join any meeting of the caste unless some arrange-
</p>
<p>ment was made to prevent the immoralities of the Maharajas. We rejoined that the
</p>
<p>object of the meeting to be held then was quite different. I was present at the
</p>
<p>meeting held at the house of Chimunlaljee Maharaj to arrange the preliminaries of
</p>
<p>the Bhattia meeting. Purbhoodass, who manages this case, was standing at some
</p>
<p>distance from the meeting.
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  " I heard that the Slaya Prakash was supported by some
</p>
<p>of the leaders of the Vallabhacharya sect. If any member of the sect held opinions
</p>
<p>at variance with those of the majority, he must remain isolated in his own house,
</p>
<p>and the sect would have no communication with him. I would not invite him to any
</p>
<p>caste dinners.
</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  " I would regard as practically outcasted any persons
</p>
<p>v/ho said that the Maharajas were guilty of wicked practices."
</p>
<p>165
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  " I would regard as an outcaste any person who charged the
</p>
<p>Maharajas with immorahties. I would not speak to Goculdass, Lukhmidass, Muthooradass,
</p>
<p>and others. I am a Murjadee (staunch devotee)."
</p>
<p>(27.)  Devidass Asurdass, examined by Mr. Bayley.  " I am a member of the
</p>
<p>Vallabhacharya sect, and a native of Shikarpore. I saw the plaintiff when he was at
</p>
<p>Shikarpore about eight years ago. He remained there about two months and a half.
</p>
<p>I used to visit him for " durshun." Any Maharaj I would regard as a gooroo, being
</p>
<p>a follower of Vallabhacharya. He bore a good character for chastity and morality. I
</p>
<p>heard no rumour against him. I have been in Bombay five years."
</p>
<p>'; (28.)  TuUopchund Tejban, examined by Mr. Scoble.  " I am a resident of Mooltan,
</p>
<p>where I saw the plaintiff about eight years ago. I regard all Maharajas as gooroos.
</p>
<p>I used to visit plaintiff once a day for " durshun" He bore a very good reputation
</p>
<p>as to chastity and morality ; every body went to him to make " durshun." I am a
</p>
<p>mooneem in Bombay to Amirdas Chimunlal."
</p>
<p>(29.)  Kuttonmull Mookhund, examined by Mr. Bayley.  " I am a resident of
</p>
<p>Hyderabad in Sind, and am a jeweller. I saw the plaintiff in Hyderabad five or six
</p>
<p>years ago ; he resided four months there. There are many Vallabhacharyas in Hyderabad.
</p>
<p>I visited the plaintiff daily for three months in the house which he occupied. He bore a
</p>
<p>good reputation, and I heard nothing to his discredit.
</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  " I went to make " durshun" to the plaintiff; there were
</p>
<p>no images there "
</p>
<p>(30.)  Permanund Heinraj, examined by Mr. Scoble  " I resided lately at Umritsur
</p>
<p>and am a native of Shikarpore. I know the plaintiff whom I saw at Umritsur ten or
</p>
<p>eleven years ago. He remained there ten or fourteen days. I use to visit him for
</p>
<p>" durshun." He bore a good reputation, and I heard no report against him. The plain-
</p>
<p>tiflf next proceeded to Mooltan and Lahore."
</p>
<p>(31.)  Ramdass Dhitnoomull, examined by Mr. Bayley.  "I am a native of Shikar-
</p>
<p>pore. I saw the plaintiff in Mandavie in Cutch, where he stayed four or five months.
</p>
<p>I visited him for " durshun." He bore a good character, and I heard no report to his
</p>
<p>discredit."
</p>
<p>(32.)  Nundram S/iastree, examined by Mr. Scoble.  " I am a JN'aggur Brahmin
</p>
<p>and a Pooranee. I know the books of the Vallabhacharya religion, and have read Goculnath-
</p>
<p>jee's commentary. This manuscript (produced in Court) contains the commentary ; it was

</p>
<p>charya sect. I got the ancient manuscript of the commentary from the plaintiff'.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " There are six sections of Naggur Brahmins, which
</p>
<p>are separate from each other since the origin of the Vallabhachai'ya sect. These sections
</p>
<p>hold no communication with my section and with each other. There are about two hun-
</p>
<p>dred houses of my sect. It is not considered m the Shastras, particularly in the Bhagwut
</p>
<p>which contains the doctrines of my sect, an offence or impropriety to tell lies to save the
</p>
<p>life of a Brahmin or a cow, for the sake of marriage, &c., &c.
</p>
<p>166
</p>
<p>(33.)  James Flynn, Chiet Translator and Interpreter, deposed to having translated
</p>
<p>the commentary alluded to by the last witness. The translation was made from the copy,
</p>
<p>and not from the original."
</p>
<p>(34.)  Veljee Muckunjee, examined by Mr. Scoble. " I am a Brahmin of the Sachora
</p>
<p>caste, and have been in the service of the plaintiff for the last fifteen years. I went with
</p>
<p>him on his travels, and was every moment with him. I accompanied him on his visits
</p>
<p>to the temples, when four of the Sircar's sepoys and a Karbharee attended him, as also
</p>
<p>his own sepoys and a number of Vaishnavs. At noon, the females went to him for
</p>
<p>" durshun," No " durshun" was allowed after six o'clock in the evening. During the
</p>
<p>plaintiff's residence at Beyt, women came for " durshun" up to the Maharaj's dinner
</p>
<p>time. They were always accompanied by some males. Males accompany females when
</p>
<p>the latter go to the temples at all places. Plaintiff had two rooms, one a bed-room and
</p>
<p>the other a cook-room, and he took his meals in the latter. There was a separate room
</p>
<p>to which only the fellowers were admitted. I never saw a female enter the bed-room. I
</p>
<p>did not see the plaintiff throw golal upon any one at the temple of Luxmee.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr, Anstey.  " It is usual at the Maharaja's house to pay three
</p>
<p>rupees a month to servants of my class. I put in order the Maharaja's clothes after he
</p>
<p>has taken them off. I do not leave him for five minutes. It is my custom to sleep outside
</p>
<p>the door when the Maharaj sleeps in his bed-room. I will suppress stooling is necessary ; but
</p>
<p>will not leave the Maharaj alone. Even if he told me, I would not go ; not that we suspect him,
</p>
<p>but because some one must be constantly within call. I and the other servants are not
</p>
<p>procurers to the MBharajas. He is standing downstairs, and is watched by one Choberjee.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Scoble.  " At Beyt, the Maharaj's wife was not with him ; she was at her
</p>
<p>father's. He has two children who, with his wife, reside in Bombay at present.
</p>
<p>He has a son of seven years and a daughter of four. If the Maharaj did anything wrong
</p>
<p>I would tell him that, and also inform the people of it. I never observed any impropriety
</p>
<p>in his conduct. I get three rupees a month besides board and lodging."
</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  " The Maharaj travelled continuously for five or six years
</p>
<p>dui-ing the whole of which time his wife was not with him."
</p>
<p>The name of Jadunathjee Brizruttonjee Maharaj, the plaintiff in this action, was here
</p>
<p>called out by the Crier, and all eyes were strained in every direction of the hall of justice
</p>
<p>to see His Holiness coming in. There was a rush of persons in one part, but from
</p>
<p>the midst of them the hero did not come forth. The large mass of his followers
</p>
<p>in Court stood up in reverence to the Maharaj's shadow, and whispers of " he is

<p>coming" went round the lines of the spectators. The legal adviser rose up in medi-
</p>
<p>tation from his chair, and perhaps satisfied with an answer from the Crier, sat down
</p>
<p>again. A few minutes of intense curiosity and wistful glances elapsed, when two tall in-
</p>
<p>dividuals entered the Court followed by the Maharaj and his attendants and admirers.
</p>
<p>His Holiness, supported on either side by Mr. Vurjeevundass Madhowdass, J. P., and
</p>
<p>others, was conducted into the witness-box, in which he showed a wonderfully bold front
</p>
<p>considering the weight of the charges levelled against him. Judunathjee is a young man
</p>
<p>of about thirty-five, of a well-knit and robust constitution, of a dark colour, and of a
</p>
<p>middle stature. He seems to have taken particular care of his whiskers, which were
</p>
<p>rather exuberant and shown to advantage. The swearing priest of the Court asked him to
</p>
<p>take the required oath on a sacred book, which was held out before him. Mr. Anstey
</p>
<p>167
</p>
<p>wished him to take off his shoes, which he did. The Maharaj seemed unwilling to take
</p>
<p>oath on the book.
</p>
<p>Maharaj to priest.  What is the necessity of making me swear on this book ? I
</p>
<p>cannot speak anything but the truth.
</p>
<p>Priest.  Do take the oath according to the Sircar's regulations.
</p>
<p>Interpreter to Court.  The Maharaj says he need not be sworn.
</p>
<p>Maharaj.  I will make solemn affirmation.
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse.  If he wishes his evidence to be taken, tell him he must take an
</p>
<p>oath on the book.
</p>
<p>Maharaj.  I speak the truth all my life, but if the Court wishes, I will take the oath.
</p>
<p>He then took the required oath. At Mr. Bayley's request the Court allowed him a
</p>
<p>chair to sit in while giving his evidence.
</p>
<p>(35.)  Jadunathjee Brizruttovjee Maharaj, examined by Mr. Bayley.  " I am the plaintiff
</p>
<p>in this action, and am above thirty-five years of age. I have never been in a Court of
</p>
<p>Justice in my life before. To my knowledge no other Maharaj has attended in a Court of
</p>
<p>Justice. Besides Gujeratee, I know the Punjabee, Marwaree, and Hindoostanee languages,
</p>
<p>Oordoo more or less, Sanscrit for the most part, and the Brij Bhasha. I have seen those
</p>
<p>of the books of the Vallabhacharya sect which are necessary. I have opened a Sanscrit
</p>
<p>and Gujeratee school at Surat, the expenses of which are defrayed by me. One Shastree
</p>
<p>gives instruction in Sanscrit, and five or six teachers teach Gujeratee. Since I first came
</p>
<p>to Bombay I have taken an interest in female education. I first paid a visit about nine-
</p>
<p>teen months ago to the ' Munguldass Girl School.' It is the duty of all Hindus to go on
</p>
<p>pilgrimages, the length of which varies with the kind of pilgrimage and the place. I set out
</p>
<p>on a pilgrimage, and arrived in Beyt in 1907. I visited twice a day the temple of Luxmee.
</p>
<p>Golal is thrown on the image in this temple. In the temple of Dwarkanathjee it is also thrown
</p>
<p>on the followers. I never threw golal on the persons of the devotees at the temple of Luxmee.
</p>
<p>How can I touch the breast of any female, when I regard all female devotees as my children ?
</p>
<p>I never did so. I know Lukhmidass Khimjee, with whom I first became acquainted about two
</p>
<p>years or two years and a half ago. I did not see him at Beyt in 1907. Any story he may
</p>
<p>have told against me is false. The last witness Veljee is my personal attendant, and was so on
</p>
<p>my pilgrimage. He is daily in my presence. It is the custom amongst all of my class
</p>
<p>to have at least three or four personal attendants constantly near them. I have visited
</p>
<p>Baroda, Gocul, Muthra, Umritsur, two Mandavies, Mooltan, and other places. I saw
</p>
<p>Goculdass Tejpall and Lukmidass Khimjee at Byculla where they came to me. I was

</p>
<p>married in 1905 or 1906 before I went to Shikarpore. I did not leave Surat because of
</p>
<p>a charge of rape against me. My wife was not with me on my pilgrimage to Beyt. I
</p>
<p>have been subpoenaed by the defendants to give evidence here ; I was served by a Parsee.
</p>
<p>I saw Goculdass Tejpall on my first visit to Bombay ; he introduced me to Lukhmidass.
</p>
<p>I first put up at Byculla when I came to Bombay two years ago. Lukhmidass invited
</p>
<p>me on one occasion when his brother was sick, and on another at the reading of the
</p>
<p>Bhagwut. I have some faint recollection of having authorized the publication of some
</p>
<p>articles in the Chabook newspaper. I did not tell Lukhmidass that the Maharajas were
</p>
<p>running away trom Bombay in consequence of the articles in the newspapers, or that I
</p>
<p>168
</p>
<p>had came to conduct a debate with them. I asked him if this action would proceed ia
</p>
<p>my absence from Bombay. I have done nothing improper in respect to any female devotee
</p>
<p>in Bombay. I know Kallabhoy Lalloobhoy, and remember having seen him in Surat and
</p>
<p>in Bombay. (Denies another allegation of immorality.) As to making " durshun,"
</p>
<p>thousands of males and females used to visit me. Adultery is most distinctly prohibited
</p>
<p>in our religion. It never formed the topic of conversation between me and Karrabhoy.
</p>
<p>He discussed with me about the authenticity and genuineness of the religious books.
</p>
<p>(Denies an allegation of immorality.) I don't remember having conversed with a doctor
</p>
<p>on the subject of adultery ; I have never been guilty of it in my life. No female ever
</p>
<p>entered my bedroom whilst I was talking to Kallabhoy. Many females daily visit my
</p>
<p>wife and children. I had no conversation at Surat with Kallabhoy about touching the
</p>
<p>toes. He came and used to read with other boys a book for children which I caused to
</p>
<p>be written and printed at my expense. I assisted in its compilation. It is the universal
</p>
<p>custom for my followers to touch my feet ; when I am sitting on a raised seat, the feet
</p>
<p>are touched from above and below, but when the foot is on the ground, it is touched at
</p>
<p>the top. Generally it is touched at the top. Kallabhoy said to me that all the Hindoo
</p>
<p>Shastras are false, and that he had become a perfect disciple of JSTarmadashanker. As I
</p>
<p>maintain and am convinced that the Shastras are true, he perhaps thinks I am therefore
</p>
<p>guilty of telling falsehood. Narmadashanker is a Naggur Brahmin of Surat ; he holds
</p>
<p>opinions contrary to mine. I had no conversation with Lukhmidass or any one else about
</p>
<p>the Vurkuts, nor did I ever say to any body that they had corrupted me. I don't know
</p>
<p>what is the meaning of " Euss mundlee ;" I know " Has mundlee" and have seen it
</p>
<p>too. The latter is a dramatic representation, and there is nothing indecent in it. When
</p>
<p>the deity is represented, we (Maharajas) get up for the time ; other spectators continue
</p>
<p>sitting. The Vaishnavs worship me and other Maharajas as gooroos, those who cause
</p>
<p>happiness through God and are guides to him. I have not heard any one say that we
</p>
<p>are worshipped as gods. We are swung in a swing because we are gooroos. When any
</p>
<p>money or present is given to us in the name of God, we take it. The devotees regard us
</p>
<p>as gooroos, as guides to God : the Thackorjee is God. We spend from 3 to 8 or 10
</p>
<p>o'clock in the morning, and from 4 to 6 o'clock in the evening, in the worship of Thac-
</p>
<p>korjee. The idol in the temple is regarded as the image of God. In no book written by
</p>
<p>Vallabhacharya is it inculcated that the Maliarajas are to be worshipped as Gods. I am
</p>
<p>acquainted with Goculnathjee's commentary ; I allowed Nundram Shastree to copy it. It
</p>
<p>is considered a book of great authority by us and by all the Vaishnavs. The first

</p>
<p>Vallabhacharya is regarded as the incarnation of the head of God ; he lived about 350 or
</p>
<p>375 years ago. He was the disseminator of the opinions of Vishnoo Swamee. Our faith
</p>
<p>is not opposed to the doctrines of the Veds and the Shastras. In my school at Surat,
</p>
<p>Sanscrit grammar is now being taught The manuscript of the commentary referred to,
</p>
<p>was found in my house and was the property of my father, who died in 1908. It is
</p>
<p>more than a hundred years old. I have read it. The Purshotum referred to therein is
</p>
<p>the God of all gods, the Supreme Being. What is therein stated to be offered to God, is
</p>
<p>stated in the defendant's article to be offered to me and the Maharajas. The sense of the
</p>
<p>original is perverted by the defendant. " Tun, mun, and dhun" are directed to be offered
</p>
<p>to God. It is not inculcated in that commentary or in any other book of the sect, that
</p>
<p>one should offer his wife and daughter to the Maharaj. I have not heard that any of my
</p>
<p>followers believes in a book containing such doctrines.

<p>Ticentieth Bay, Thursday, 21th February, 18G2.
</p>
<p>Jadoimathjee Brizrutlonjee Mahavaj, further examined by Mr. Eayley.  " I know
</p>
<p>Dr. Bhawoo Dajee. Since my arrival in Bombay he did not attend ma professionally. He
</p>
<p>came to visit me once, in company writh Lukhmidass Khimjee. I saw him on one occasion
</p>
<p>when I visited a girk' school. I was suffering from itches when Dr. Bhawoo visited me,
</p>
<p>because I had taken heating medicines when I was sick. I have suffered from eruptions
</p>
<p>occasionally. Some of the heating medicines v?-ere prepared by myself, and others by a
</p>
<p>native doctor. When Dr. Bhawoo came to me, I told him I was subject to itches and
</p>
<p>described my case to him, and told him I had taken heating medicines. The word
</p>
<p>" chandee" was not used at all by either of us. I asked him to prescribe some medicine
</p>
<p>for rie. I never suffered from the venerial affection. The next day I sent Goverdhundass
</p>
<p>to Dr. Bhawoo to get back a manuscript book for girls' school, which I had prepared and
</p>
<p>given him for an inspection. I asked Goverdhundass at the same time to bring any
</p>
<p>medicine which Dr. Bhawoo might give. I did not tell him (Dr. Bhawoo) that the story
</p>
<p>of the disease would be communicated to him the next day, and applied my ov;n medicines.
</p>
<p>I know Dr. Dhirajram Dulputram, whom T saw at the exhibition of, I believe, Munguldass
</p>
<p>Nathoobhoy's school. I consulted him and took the medicines he gave. I described my
</p>
<p>case to him in the same manner as I had described it to Dr. Bhawoo. He prescribed
</p>
<p>some pills and a powder for me. The colour of the powder turned black when it was
</p>
<p>mixed with water. He came for six or seven days for treating me ; and also on other
</p>
<p>occasions. He is a Yallabhacharya. Since my acquaintance with him, he visited me often.
</p>
<p>I convened a meeting to discuss the question of widow remarriage ; in consequence of a
</p>
<p>note addressed to me by Xarmadashunker, I attended the meeting, but expressed no
</p>
<p>opinion on remarriage, because othei' and irrelevant subjects were mooted for
</p>
<p>discussion and were discussed. The subject of remarriage was not disciissed. I said
</p>
<p>some Shastra must be fixed upon as an authority upon the subject of remarriage.
</p>
<p>N'armadashunker said the Shastras may be followed when advisable, or not. I said we
</p>
<p>must acknowledge all the Shastras ; and my opinion was that, if the Shastras allowed,
</p>
<p>remarriages might take place, but not otherwise. I have seen no authority in the Shastras
</p>
<p>for remarriages. But I have no objection personally thereto. In my sect remarriages take
</p>
<p>place, and I don't prohibit them. Lukhmidass was present when Dr. Bhawoo visited me ;
</p>
<p>he was sitting by and heard what I said. I had no further conversation with him on the
</p>
<p>gubject of the disease. I did not confess to him anything prejudicial to my chastity or
</p>
<p>morality. On the same occasion. I did not speak to him about the practices of other

</p>
<p>Maharajas. I have seen no instance of improprieties on the part of any Maharaj. I did
</p>
<p>not tell Lukhmidass that I did not commit such enormities as I did before. I did not tell
</p>
<p>him that any improvement in the practices of the Maharajas must be gradual, and cannot
</p>
<p>be made at once ; nor that our income is chiefly derived from females. I told him I
</p>
<p>intended to go to Shrijee Dwar, but not that I had fears of my life there. I have caused
</p>
<p>a plan of my premises to be prepared. Tliousands of females go to the zenana, passing
</p>
<p>on their way througk the " deevankhana." There are two doors to the " deevankhana,"
</p>
<p>one leading to the zenana and the other to the staircase. On the left side of the " dee-
</p>
<p>vankhana" is a room in which my clothes and water are kept. There is another room at
</p>
<p>a few cubits' distance, in which the other Maharaja's furniture and goods are kept, and
</p>
<p>v^hich is
</p>
<p>Crosg-examined by Mr. Amslcy.  The room last mentioned is in charge of Chimunjee
</p>
<p>90
</p>
<p>170
</p>
<p>Maharafs servants. One of the two staircases is closed, and is also in the charge of
</p>
<p>Chimunjee Mahara''s servants. I am a man, and not a God. I am a man and a gooroo
</p>
<p>to my followers. I am not an incarnation of the Deity and I am not aware that hitherto
</p>
<p>any of my followers has ever regarded me as a God or an incarnation of God. Our
</p>
<p>Acharjee is regarded as an incarnation of God, and we are regarded as his descendants
</p>
<p>and gooroos. I do not remember whether Kursondass ISTensey once addressed me as
</p>
<p>" Ishwur," God. I and other Maharajas are not addressed to as Maha Prabhoo, or
</p>
<p>Purshotum, or Dev ; we are called the children of Maha Prabhoo. Vallabhachai ya and
</p>
<p>his son Gosaijee are regarded as incarnations of God but not so the sons of Gosaiiee. The
</p>
<p>Maharajas are styled Vallubh Dev (Vallubh the God). The words Agnee-swuroop (form
</p>
<p>of fire) is not applied to us. The title of Poorn Purshotum (perfect God) is applied to the
</p>
<p>Maharajas. I held no meeting at 10 o'clock on Tuesday night to consider what answers I
</p>
<p>should make. Purbhoodass did not tell me I should say " I don't recollect." The words
</p>
<p>referred to above are applied as titles to the Maharajas in books inaccessible to sucli
</p>
<p>followers as understand Sanscrit. I have taught my devotees that they should regard us
</p>
<p>as gooroos, not as Gods. This book contains the names and pictures of Vallabhacharya
</p>
<p>and two of his immediate descendants. Vaishnavs worship these pictures. No Maharaj
</p>
<p>of the nam.e of Dowjee is worshipped ; he was the proprietor of one of the principal
</p>
<p>" gaddees" (seats). These pictures are sold in the bazar for purposesof worship by the Vaish-
</p>
<p>navs. In the garden in which I put up there is a seat to which people resort for
</p>
<p>" durshun." I don't know if it is the seat of Dowjee. I have seen a seat of Dowjee in
</p>
<p>Surat. The name of Krishna occurs in a portion of the Veds. (Witness is examined as
</p>
<p>to the extent of his knowledge of the Veds and Purans.) There is sin in telling lies, even
</p>
<p>for a good purpose. (Witness is handed a copy of the Bhagwut and interprets a passage
</p>
<p>therein.) Untruth may be told to women in sport, on occasion of marriages, when life is
</p>
<p>in danger, when a cow is to be killed, &c. ; any one who tells lies on such occasions is
</p>
<p>not to be despised, but he commits a sin nevertheless. Since the rising of the Court I
</p>
<p>had no consultation with Verjeevundas and others. I believe everything mentioned in the
</p>
<p>Bhagwut. The Shastras of the Vaishnavs are in accordance with the Veds. I have not
</p>
<p>published any pamphlet : no periodicals were published by the Vaishnav Dhurma Sabha,
</p>
<p>which were written by Goverdhundass. I was the originator of the society. Haryraijee
</p>
<p>was a Maharaj ; I cannot say if he wrote any books in the Brij Bhasha. I cannot say
</p>
<p>whether a few Maharajas only can read Sanscrit. The wives and daughters of the
</p>
<p>Maharajas read books in the Brij Bhasha. I am unable to say whether this book (the

<p>Vachan-amrut in Brig Bhasha) is considered a religious book. I have not read up to this
</p>
<p>time any work in the Brij Bhasha relating to the Vallabhacharya religion, with the
</p>
<p>exception of songs in praise of the Creator. I mean to say that I have never in my life
</p>
<p>read a theological or philosophical work in the Brig Bhasha on the Vallabhacharya religion.
</p>
<p>I now remember I have read in Brij Bhasha one of Goculnathjee's commentaries. I do
</p>
<p>not read books of my sect in the Marathi language. I know Goverdhundass wrote an
</p>
<p>essay in the " Propagator of our own religion" on adulterine love, in the opinions expressed
</p>
<p>in which I agree in the main. I did not tell him to write that essay. It was written in
</p>
<p>reply to an article in a Marathee magazine, but I cannot say if it was in reply to the
</p>
<p>libel in the Satya Prakash. I cannot say whether it is the belief of my sect or not that
</p>
<p>the ffopees loved God as their paramour, and that God loved them and made them happy.
</p>
<p>(Witness was asked as to several of the doctrines of the sect, mentioned at length in the
</p>
<p>pleas, whether or not they were believed in by himsel ^iby his sect. Several of the
</p>
<p>171
</p>
<p>questions ho said he was unable to answer vvitliout reading a great portion of the
</p>
<p>context in the books in which the doctrines were mentioned.) The writer of the essay
</p>
<p>understands his subject, and I think it contains upon the whole, a fair exposition of
</p>
<p>the doctrines cf the sect. Whatever is stated in the Shastras is accepta'-'le to
</p>
<p>me. Besides the sacred bool<s of my sect, there are other Shastras, viz., the
</p>
<p>Bhagwut, the Purans, &c. The young maidens of my sect swing Krishna in a swing,
</p>
<p>(rod Krishna is their father, husband, lord, &c. They swing me and the other Maharajas
</p>
<p>as a gooroo. We are swung by our fathers, mothers, sisters, and all devotees : but I do
</p>
<p>not recollect whether we are addressed to as the amorous Kann (Cupid). These amorous
</p>
<p>songs are addressed to the Maharajas. (Heads and interprets passages in Sanscrit in Gocul-
</p>
<p>nathjee's commentary.) Since the last two or thrte days, I have been subjected to surgical
</p>
<p>examination by two or three medical gentlemen. My face was not covered when one of
</p>
<p>them saw me. I don't know if one of them refuses to give evidence that there is no trace
</p>
<p>in me of the venereal affection. They examined me from a short distance. I don't know
</p>
<p>their names, and I have not been told that only two of them are coming to give evidence.
</p>
<p>Vurjeevundass Madhavdass, J. P., and Calliandass Mohundass, his nephew who conducts this
</p>
<p>case, might have brought the doctors ; I don't know. The examination took place in the
</p>
<p>shop of Kagoo Shauijce, one of the conspirators.

</p>
<p>JadooiicUkjee Brizrultonjee MaharaJ, cross-examined by Mr. Anstey.  " Since my
</p>
<p>cross-examination yesterday, I have not been again inspected by a doctor. I did not ask
</p>
<p>Dr. Dhirajram to send me calomel from time to time whenever I wanted it. Once I put
</p>
<p>calomel into chunam water and made a blackwash of it, and applied it. Dr. Dhirajram
</p>
<p>told me to take a pill twice in the day, and I took five or six pills. I have purchased
</p>
<p>now a glass scale for use in taking photographs ; I had none for measuring medicines.
</p>
<p>When my throat became sore a preparation of borax was given me as a gargle. I had
</p>
<p>sent for some iodide of potash and sarsaparilla. I tried the former ; the latter I adminis-
</p>
<p>tered medically to another person. I have heard the name of Brahma-vivarta Puran ; I
</p>
<p>have not read it ; it is believed in by the Vaishnavs. (Witness is shown a passage in the
</p>
<p>book.) It runs thus : " Upon having seen the " Eas," the mistresses of the God were
</p>
<p>tormented with the arrows of love ; upon having performed the " rutee-rus" Krishna, the
</p>
<p>perfect and perpetual along with Radha, went to the waters of Yamoona ; with the gopees
</p>
<p>went the magical forms of the exalted Krishna, which, tormented with the arrows of love,
</p>
<p>and prevaded with joy, performed sport with the gopees in the water." The ti'anslation is

</p>
<p>correct, but I am not quite certain of the meaning. I must collate the passage with
</p>
<p>other books. (Witness is shown another passage.) It appears to be addressed to Kadha,
</p>
<p>Krishna's principal Mistress as follows : 
</p>
<p>" Why does thou weep, O Radha ! remember the lotus feet of Krishna ; during the
</p>
<p>Ras mundlee night will fall thou will perform with Krishna the desired uninterrupted
</p>
<p>ruttoe." I know the Vishnoo Puran ; I may have seen a passage in it here and there.
</p>
<p>172
</p>
<p>I don't remember having read the following passage ;  " Whilst frolicking thus with tlie
</p>
<p>(iopees, they considered every instant without him a myriad of years, and without the fear
</p>
<p>of their husbands, fathers and brothers, they went forth there to perform sport at night with
</p>
<p>Krishna." The Vaishnavs read the- Vishnoo Puran, not because they contain descrip-
</p>
<p>tions of the sports of Krishna with the gopees, but because they contain Vaishnav
</p>
<p>doctrines. We worship images of Krishna with the faith we are actually worshipping
</p>
<p>Krishna. He is brought into the images partly by ceremonies, partly by faitli. The
</p>
<p>images of Krishna are represented as if he were in the infantile state. I have never
</p>
<p>seen him in the young or old state. (Witness is handed a picture of Krishna, at the
</p>
<p>top of a tree with the naked gopees at the foot of it.) He is here represented between
</p>
<p>the ages of 5 and 11 years. When the Maharaj dies, persons say he is gone to
</p>
<p>his abode, or to the world of gods. Krishna, when he died, went to the Gowlowk ;
</p>
<p>religious and pious Vaishnavs go there also= He (Krishna) remains all day in joy ;
</p>
<p>the Vaishnavs are present there in his service. I have not observed in any book if
</p>
<p>it is the doctrine of my sect, that true Vaishnavs, after death, become gopees and
</p>
<p>have amorous and improper intercourse with God. I do not believe in this doctrine,
</p>
<p>nor am I aware if any of my followers does or do believe in it. By " lila" I
</p>
<p>understand sport, play. I believe it is impossible that Krishna should renew, in
</p>
<p>paradise, his amorous dalliance with the gopees ; he may engage in " ras lila" with
</p>
<p>them. The gopees are there in human form, but are not subject to early decay.
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse.  I hope, Jlr. Anstey, you are done with the theological part of
</p>
<p>the examination.
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould remarked that the subject might well be taken up for a
</p>
<p>theological discussion between Dr. Wilson and the Maharaj outside the Court ; but as
</p>
<p>it was, the Court could not be made the arena for] such theological discussion. The
</p>
<p>question now was as to the libel.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey.  I am near the end of this part of the examination, my Lord.
</p>
<p>Witness continued to say.  I " am forbidden to repeat here the " muntra" pronounced
</p>
<p>at the " kanthee" ceremony. The translation you give of it is correct. The dedication
</p>
<p>referred to in this " muntra" is caused to be made at the feet of Krishna not to the
</p>
<p>Maharaj. The gooroo at the ceremony is only the guide to Krishna. (Witness is
</p>
<p>examined as to the meaning of another passage.) I asked Lukhmidass if an action
</p>
<p>might go on in the absence of one of the parties. When I first arrived from Surat,
</p>
<p>I had no intention of bringing an action against those who published anything against

</p>
<p>the Maharajas. The reason for the delay of six months, in bringing the present action
</p>
<p>was that I am not acquainted with such matters in this island, and found it necessary
</p>
<p>to consult and take advice. (Witness is shown a passage of an article published in the
</p>
<p>Satya Prakash on the 9Lh September, against all the Maharajas.) When all the
</p>
<p>Maharajas are libelled, how could I alone bring an action. I do not remem.ber if I
</p>
<p>consulted Mr. I;eathes about this article. I do not remember if I read it ; I heard
</p>
<p>that all the Maharajas were libelled, I cannot say if it was in consequence of this
</p>
<p>article or not; that a handbill was published with my name to it, what is stated in
</p>
<p>the handbill as to the lessening authority of the Maharajas accords with my view.
</p>
<p>The words " Asatya Prakash" in one of the numbers of the " Propagator of our own
</p>
<p>Religion" icfers to the defendant's paper; I think it is an error of the printer, or
</p>
<p>173
</p>
<p>the letter " a" (not) may have fallen in by mistake near the word " Satya." I don't
</p>
<p>know if this article in the magazine was written in answer to the libel ; I cannot say
</p>
<p>without reading over the whole ot it.
</p>
<p>Sir 'M. Sausse.  Xow tell this witness the manner in which he has been giving
</p>
<p>his evidence latterly, is such as to impress the Court with an unfavorable view re-
</p>
<p>garding it. He must be able to answer without reading over everything about which
</p>
<p>he is questioned.
</p>
<p>Witness.  " I cannot answer v.'ithout reading it over 1
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse.  The man has too much intelligence and collected manner not to
</p>
<p>recollect or to know what he says he 'cannot answer.
</p>
<p>"Witness continued.  " Then the article may be in answer to the libel. I have read
</p>
<p>part of the book called the " Debauched Gooroo." It refers to " rus mundlee." I
</p>
<p>have read the article containing the libel ; it reflects upon me. The article says, " You
</p>
<p>^Maharajas, acting up to that commentary, defile the wives and daughters," &c. This
</p>
<p>is libellous, though not directed against me individually. Being charged with the
</p>
<p>immoralities of the " Eus mundlee." I do not consider it libellous, because I do not
</p>
<p>understand what " Rus mundlee" means.
</p>
<p>Witness proceeded to say.  " The book of Ilaryriajee is in Sanscrit. I have never
</p>
<p>ueen it in Brij Bhasha. I have heard of a work in ilarathee by Janardhun Ram-
</p>
<p>chunderjee, entitled " Biographies of Eminent Men."' The story of the 252 and of the
</p>
<p>84 is not considered a book of authority in our sect. This book of songs was not
</p>
<p>published by me, nor do I know if it was published by Goverhundass.
</p>
<p>" I don't know if it is a libel upon the defendant. The representation of a Maharaj
</p>
<p>drawing a triumphant chariot over the prostrate bodies of the reformers does not refer
</p>
<p>to me ; the printer must know who the Maharaj is.
</p>
<p>Maharaj.  Ko one should touch me.
</p>
<p>Sir. M. Sausse.  " I saw no one attempt to touch you.
</p>
<p>Maharaj.  " I am afraid some of the persons going from behind might touch me.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey.  Why should you not be touched? I am not going to touch you.
</p>
<p>You are not a God. As for me I won't touch you with a pair of tongs. Mr.
</p>
<p>Hastings has already touched you the first day.
</p>
<p>Witness proceeded.  " The chief temple of our sect is that of Shreenathjee at Cancrowlee.
</p>
<p>An image thence was not stolen by my father or grandfather ; my grandfather sat on the
</p>
<p>" gaddee" at Surat. There was a suit about the gaddee which was litigated in England.

</p>
<p>I have never gone on a pilgrimage to that temple, although I was seven years abroad.
</p>
<p>The Maharaj receives presents and contributions from the Vaishnavs. Fines are also
</p>
<p>levied, the money received by way of fine being eventually applied to the use of the
</p>
<p>Thackorjee. I am not a Brahmacharya ; I was one before my marriage. I am not
</p>
<p>a Sanyasee. I believe in Poorn Purshotum, who is one. Poorn Purshotum (perfect God)
</p>
<p>is applied as a title to the Maharajas, as " My Lord" is applied to the judges. I
</p>
<p>don't know if the gooroos of other sects are swung in a swing like the Maharajas.
</p>
<p>I have never seen the water from a Maharaj's lanjotee rinsed and drunk by the
</p>
<p>174
</p>
<p>Valshnavs. The "joolhun" (remnants of food) left by tlie Maharajas is eaten like that
</p>
<p>of all other gooroos. It is the custom in all sects of Hindoos. It is written that the
</p>
<p>Brahmins should partake of the leavings of gooroo's food. I don't know if there is a pro-
</p>
<p>hibition in Menu. We give for the purpose of being thrown away the leavings of our
</p>
<p>" pan soparee." They may be eaten by some persons. The Maharaj applies his foot to
</p>
<p>the eyes of a dying person to relieve him from sin ; no fee is paid for this. I don't know
</p>
<p>if the gooroos of any other sect do this. Males, females, and children apply and wash
</p>
<p>with saffron water and scented oils the bodies of the Maharajas. I don't allow my
</p>
<p>followers to eat the dust of my feet : I don't know if other Maharajas allow it. Lights
</p>
<p>are waved round the Maharajas heads. All this is enjoined in the Shastras ; I don't
</p>
<p>know what Shastra. The wooden shoes of my . ancestors are worshipped as also of
</p>
<p>other Maharajas. My shoes are not worshipped. I do not go into private rooms to
</p>
<p>receive presents of fruit and sweetmeat from female devotees. I don't know if others
</p>
<p>do it. Vaishnavs bring them and present them to the Thackorjee and we then receive
</p>
<p>them. I don't know if other Maharajas go into private rooms for this purpose. Female
</p>
<p>devotees do not sing songs of a licentious character in the presence of the Maharajas ;
</p>
<p>songs of various kinds are sung. Golal is thrown by Maharajas on the persons of all
</p>
<p>devotees, not expressly on the persons of females. The gooroo is to be worshipped in
</p>
<p>the same way as the image of Thackorjee, which represents God. I have not read
</p>
<p>in " Gooroo Seva" that all the Vallabhacharya Gosaijees are to be considered as in-
</p>
<p>carnations of God. Ever since I arrived at a proper age I have told my followers not
</p>
<p>to believe in this doctrine. Before my admonition, the doctrine was believed in. It
</p>
<p>was believed in by some persons in Bombay, not the majority. I cannot remember
</p>
<p>the names of any one person whom I instructed not to believe in the doctrine. Did
</p>
<p>I say yesterday that I did not know whether any one regarded the Maharajas to be
</p>
<p>incarnations of God ? Perhaps I did. I do not know if I swore to that effect.
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse.  Tell him the Court has taken down clearly what he said.
</p>
<p>Witness.  "I don't recollect it.
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse.  0, his memory is very short ; but the Court has taken down
</p>
<p>exactly what he said.
</p>
<p>Witness proceeded.  " The Vaishnavs believe their obligations to their gooroos to be
</p>
<p>greater than their obligation to God. The Vaishnavs are not allowed to touch the
</p>
<p>image ; and they can make offerings through the Maharajas or the Brahmins who bathe
</p>
<p>or wash their bodies inside the temple. I believe that by Brahma-sabandk the sins

</p>
<p>of the eleven organs (including those of generation) are washed away. I don't know
</p>
<p>if it is the doctrine of my sect that Vaishnavs should not divulge the secrets of the
</p>
<p>gooroo. It is good among other things, not to see the faults of others. I am a Brahmin ;
</p>
<p>you may think I have not the physical appearatice of one. My ancestors were Tellinga
</p>
<p>Brahmin's ; they were not excommunicated. We take their daughters in marriage, but
</p>
<p>d^n't give any. With reference to Telinga Brahmins in this country, we interman-y with
</p>
<p>them. I don't know if they are very poor ; they are called Bhutjees. They are not
</p>
<p>excommunicated for giving their daughters to the Maharajas. Sometimes we find it necessary
</p>
<p>to give sums of money when the parents of the bride are poor. Menu prohibits the selling
</p>
<p>of daughters ; I don't know of any prohibition against selling marriages. I believe the
</p>
<p>Maharajas to be innocent of adultery ; if they are guilty thereof, they don't deserve the
</p>
<p>rank of gooroos. Kursuna-raiajee, my cousin, has married the daughter of a Tellinga
</p>
<p>175
</p>
<p>Brahmin. I don't know of any scandals about him and a widow devotee. I don't
</p>
<p>know if his son Goculoochewjee was expelled by a Eajah from his territory. Wallubhjee
</p>
<p>Maharaj was expelled by the other Maharajas, for interfering in a dispute between a father
</p>
<p>and his son. I don't know of any scandals connected with him. I was the first Maharaj
</p>
<p>to go to Damaun, I went there through ignorance. There is a prohibition made by Maha-
</p>
<p>rajas against going there. I don't know if the reason of the prohibition was, that a Maha-
</p>
<p>raj was killed under the lash for larceny by order of the Portuguese government. Vitti-
</p>
<p>eshjee Maharaj was under surveillance at Patna ; he was accused of sorcery ; I don't know if
</p>
<p>he was accused of poisoning the Raja ; I don't know of Vrijpaljee Maharaj looting the houses of
</p>
<p>his devotees at Lakput Bunder. I left Surat on a pilgrimmage for seven years. There was no
</p>
<p>charge of rape ever made against me. I hear it this moment. I don't remember if I was asked
</p>
<p>about it the day before yesterday. I have heard of the daughter of Petamber Popa. There was
</p>
<p>no charge against me of having defiled her. I was not taken before the Surat magistrate on
</p>
<p>that charge, twelve or fourteen years ago. I have no knowledge of such a charge having
</p>
<p>been compromised for me by the then Sheristadar of Surat. I have not summoned any
</p>
<p>brother Maharajas to give evidence on my behalf. None of the Maharajas intimated to me
</p>
<p>that he cannot deny the adulteries of the Maharajas in this Court because the fact is too
</p>
<p>notorious. The son of one Maharaj is at present in Bombay except myself; all other
</p>
<p>Maharajas have left Bombay. I don't know of a disturbance near Jeevunjee's temple three
</p>
<p>months afler my arrival in Bombay. I don't know Luckmeebaee, the daughter of Thawor
</p>
<p>Mooljee. I did not know her fifteen years ago. Up to the time of the discussion on the
</p>
<p>subject of remarriage, I was on good terms with the defendant, who praised me in his
</p>
<p>newspaper.  I did not prohibit the Vaishnavs from subscribing to defendant's paper. I
</p>
<p>don't know of having published any handbills against the Sati/a Prakash being subscribed
</p>
<p>to. I have heard of the Bhattia conspiracy case. I have not arranged with the other
</p>
<p>Maharajas to shut the temples against those Vaishnavs who might give evidence against
</p>
<p>me in this case. I don't remember if Purbhoodass told me that he managed the Bhattia
</p>
<p>case. I either heard or read somewhere that Purbhoodass took some message to one Gopal -
</p>
<p>dass, and that the latter gave evidence of the visit and the message. I heard also a
</p>
<p>rumour to that effect. I first spoke to Purbhoodass on the subject during the trial ot
</p>
<p>the Bhattia conspiracy case. Purbhoodass came to me to Surat to call me here. I
</p>
<p>spoke to him then. He told me of the " bundobust" which was made here. I said
</p>
<p>" what is the necessity or object of making this bundobust" ? He said they must
</p>
<p>know. I did not authorise him to conduct or assist in the management of the case.

</p>
<p>There were no consultations between the nine conspirators at my house. One or two
</p>
<p>of them came to my house. The bundobust was in reference to the offering of virgin
</p>
<p>daughters, but I don't know for what case it was. I heard of the Bania bundobust
</p>
<p>from a number of persons who came to me and said what they had heard in this Court.
</p>
<p>I never reproved Purbhoodass for his part in the making of the bundobusts : he did
</p>
<p>neither right nor wrong. I believe what Lukhmidass has stated against me must be
</p>
<p>false ; because if he saw me commit any immoral act, he would not have continued
</p>
<p>visiting me. I have never been guilty of adultery or immoralities. I took the heating
</p>
<p>medicines at Hyderabad where I was sick. I took dry ginger, black pepper, chillies,
</p>
<p>&c., and these produced internal heat. With tha exception of six or seven months,
</p>
<p>my wife was with me on my pilgrimage. About four or five years before 1!)09, I
</p>
<p>travelled without the society of my wife, who had then died.

</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  I once travelled five years, la the course of which I went to
</p>
<p>Jeypore to call my wife. I was away from Surat for two years in the course of
</p>
<p>which I proceeded to Beyt. I have married two wives. I married before I set out
</p>
<p>for Beyt, and was away for two years from my second wife, who was then of the
</p>
<p>acre of nme or nine and a half years. She came to live with me at the age of thirteen.

</p>
<p>Jadunathjee Brizruttonjee 3IakaraJ, re-examined by Mr Scbble.^" There 'was no
</p>
<p>meeting held at my house on Tuesday evening for the purpose of a consultation. It is a
</p>
<p>common form of salutation among Hindoos to apply to each other, at a meeting, the names
</p>
<p>of Earn and Purshotum, although they may not be the real names of the persons ad-
</p>
<p>dressed to. (Mr. Scoble said he was addressed to by the names Purshotum when in
</p>
<p>Guzerat !) There are two seats of Dovvjee, who established them and also worshipped
</p>
<p>them in common with others. All the sacred books of my sect are in Sanscrit ; they
</p>
<p>are regarded as authorities even in Brij Bhasha, if they correspond with the Sanscrit
</p>
<p>originals. All the Maharajas are ex-officio Presidents of the Valshnav Dhurm-parsaruck
</p>
<p>Society, or the Society for the Propagation of the Vaishnav religion. Since my arrival
</p>
<p>from Surat, I have made exertions to propagate the Vaishnav religion. I was asked
</p>
<p>in reference to the specific offence of several Maharajas ; I heard them for the first time
</p>
<p>in Court yesterday. I have heard of those offences through several prints also ; not of my
</p>
<p>relatives in particular, but of the Maharajas generally. I heard of the charges, for the
</p>
<p>first time yesterday, brought against the Maharajas by name. The " Debauched Gooroo"
</p>
<p>is not a book of authority in my sect ; it is a lampoon. It is believed in by persons who
</p>
<p>are our enemies. The Maharajas have authority to outcaste any one from the sect, with
</p>
<p>the approval of the members of the sect. Without such approval, no one can be excom-
</p>
<p>municated. Thd Maharaj has power to prevent a person from coming to the temple over
</p>
<p>which he has jurisdiction. All the Maharajas can combine to prevent a person from coming
</p>
<p>to any of the temples. Such a combination, however, has not taken place within my
</p>
<p>knowledge.
</p>
<p>To Sir M. Sausse.  " I have said that adultery is a great sin according to the Shastras
</p>
<p>of my sect. The recommendation in the essay, already referred to, which I approved of,
</p>
<p>is not to commit adultery, but to love God with love akin to what is called adulterine love.
</p>
<p>Adulterine passion is intense love, and the same intensity of love should be shown towards
</p>
<p>God. Such love towards God is very good ; towards a strange woman, it is bad. Such
</p>
<p>an illustration is given in the Bhagwut.

<p>Sir M. Sausse.  Tell him that we are under the impression that, when asked before,
</p>
<p>he could not name any Shastra which contained such an illustration.
</p>
<p>"Witness.  " I do not remember.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey.  I asked him several times, and he could not name any.
</p>
<p>Witness to Sir M. Sausse.  I believe it is stated in the Bhagwut that love should be
</p>
<p>entertained towards God akin to the love of the qojwes.

</p>
<p>To Sir Joseph Arnould.  "1 said that God is tu be gained by worshipping him in any
</p>
<p>form or manner.
</p>
<p>Maharaj (on retiring),  " I bless your Lordships"' ! !
</p>
<p>The examination of witnesses closed here.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey addressed the Court on behalf of the defendants. The learned counsel
</p>
<p>stated that his clients had been placed in a difficult position, as by far the great part of
</p>
<p>the evidence which had been given for the plaintiff had been kept back until every one of
</p>
<p>the defendants witnesses was called and every document was put in. The defendant had
</p>
<p>not, therefore, the opportunity and the advantage which the plaintift' had, to call witnesses
</p>
<p>on their behalf to contradict the enormous mass of falsehood which it would be the duty
</p>
<p>of the learned counsel, in the course of his observations, to unravel and lay bare. The
</p>
<p>circumstance, however, would not escape the Court's observation, that the witnesses whom
</p>
<p>the defendants had called were men of position and respectability, and who would therefore
</p>
<p>claim, in the decision to which their Lordships might eventually come, a much greater
</p>
<p>weight for credibility than the unfortunate devotees of the Mahara as who had been drawn
</p>
<p>from the lower classes of society. This was the third time the learned gentleman had the
</p>
<p>honor to address the Court on the principal features of this case. On the first occasion, in
</p>
<p>the demurrer case, when one of their Lordships was present, he (Mr. Anstey) showed
</p>
<p>that the very libel itself being considered, it was impossible for the plaintiff to support his
</p>
<p>plaint upon a general demurrer. The result was, that though, with respect to nineteen-
</p>
<p>twentieths of the alleged libel, the Court thought there was no cause for calling upon the
</p>
<p>defendants for a justification, yet that there was a sufficient case in the eight or ten lines
</p>
<p>in the concluding part of the article. Mr. Anstey would not revert to all the arguments he
</p>
<p>addressed to the Court upon that occasion. It must be remarked that this action was
</p>
<p>brought by a person professing a different morality and different doctrines from Christian
</p>
<p>morality and Christian doctrines, and what the learned counsel urged was that the precedents
</p>
<p>of Erglish law which it was sought to apply to this case, can have no universal
</p>
<p>application.
</p>
<p>Mr. Scoble contended that the learned counsel must confine himself to the rebutting
</p>
<p>evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey said this was impossible from- the very nature of the case, and it was
</p>
<p>impossible to draw a line of distinction between the portions of the evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Scoble insisted upon his learned friend confining himself to the evidence offered
</p>
<p>in rebuttal. He had shown no case or cited no authority for going over the whole of the

</p>
<p>evidence.
</p>
<p>The Court decided that Mr. Anstey ought to confine his observations to the rebutting
</p>
<p>evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey submitted that the principal points and doctrines in the case were so
</p>
<p>involved one within the other, that it would be really impossible to draw the distinction.
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould suggested that the distinction might be drawn this way. Mr.
</p>
<p>Anstey would address the Court upon the evidence for the defence and the rebutting evi-
</p>
<p>dence, but not upon what he might have spoken about in the speech for the defence.
</p>
<p>23
</p>
<p>ITS
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey said this was just the course he intended to take. In commenting upon
</p>
<p>the rebutting evidence, he would alUide to, and remark upon, the evidence which it was
</p>
<p>supposed to rebut. And first, he must refer to the points which were affected by the
</p>
<p>evidence. He thought one of these point?? was, to use the words of one of their Lordships
</p>
<p>in the course of the trial, that there is no standard by which we may judge of the
</p>
<p>plaintiff. In the rebutting evidence, he had tried to set up one, which, however, it was
</p>
<p>impossible for the courts of the English law to act upon. The learned counsel's first pro-
</p>
<p>position was, that the plaintiff has no right to sue ; and second, that, if he has a right,
</p>
<p>there is no libel upon him in what the defendants have pubhshed.
</p>
<p>Mr. Scoble again applied to the Court to confine Mr. Anstey to the rebutting
</p>
<p>evidence.
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Amould remarked that the question of a justifiable occasion was still open
</p>
<p>to the defendants ; and Mr. Anstey had thought it proper to address himself to two pro-
</p>
<p>positions : 1st, that the doctrines of the sect being such and such, the plaintiff had no
</p>
<p>right to sue for redress for the enunciation and publication of those doctrines by the
</p>
<p>defendants ; and 2nd, that even if he has the right, there is no libel.
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse observed that the Court had already directed the counsel to restrict
</p>
<p>himself to the rebutting evidence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey said he had every intention to attend to the direction of the Court ; and
</p>
<p>that much time would be saved if the officious and useless interruption by the counsel for
</p>
<p>the plaintiff was not repeated.
</p>
<p>Mr. Scoble said he never heard such expressions used by one member of the Bar
</p>
<p>towards another at the Courts where he practised before coming to Bombay ; and he would
</p>
<p>take the opinion of the Court whether his objection was such as to be called officious and
</p>
<p>useless and by other similar epithets. He had equally with the counsel for the defendants
</p>
<p>a duty to perform to his client, and he would ask the Court whether a legal argument was
</p>
<p>admissible in a rebutting case. He had to learn from their Lordships, whether general
</p>
<p>observations on law were to be allowed in answer to a rebutting case.
</p>
<p>Sir M. Sausse observed that the learned counsel for the defendants had given an
</p>
<p>assurance that he could, Imva fide, support the observations he would make by the evidence
</p>
<p>and the Court gave him credit for that assurance, taking it for granted that he would
</p>
<p>sustain his propositions by referring to the rebutting evidence. With reference to the
</p>
<p>objection made by the plaintiffs counsel, his Lordship certainly did not think that he de-
</p>
<p>served to be censured with the words which had been made use of. It was proper -and

</p>
<p>becoming in him (Mr. Scoble) calmly to raise such objections as he thought were necessary
</p>
<p>for the benefit of his client.
</p>
<p>Mr Anstey then proceeded to say that the position in which the plaintiff sued is a
</p>
<p>position offensive to the laws of nature and of natural morality. The doctrines he professed
</p>
<p>and taught were horrible *to think of ; he preyed upon the blind ignorance and credulity of
</p>
<p>his followers, and in the prosecution of his unholy ends brought his peculiar Shastras to
</p>
<p>his aid. The practices of this and other Maharajas became a matter of notoriety, and
</p>
<p>were considered unendurable even by members of the sect. The defendant had, therefore
</p>
<p>done nothing more than attempt to abate a common nuisance. The circumstances, the
</p>
<p>179
</p>
<p>learned counsel said, were somewhat similar to the great Suttee case which George IV.
</p>
<p>referred for the ophiion of the Privy Council of his time. fMr. Anstey here cited an
</p>
<p>authority and alluded to the decision in the Suttee case.) Having thus adverted to the points
</p>
<p>to which he would direct the attention of the Court and to those which were supposed to
</p>
<p>have been touched by the rebutting evidence, the learned gentleman would turn to the
</p>
<p>case which the plaintiif had to rebut. Their Lordships having expressed an opinion that
</p>
<p>the plea of " not guilty" and justification is open to the defendants, he would ask the Court
</p>
<p>to bear in mind the evidence offered on that point. The counsel for the plaintiff had put
</p>
<p>questions as to the morality and status of the Maharajas, which, at the time, struck Mr.
</p>
<p>Anstey as irregular, and he would now take advantage of that irregularity. Then as to
</p>
<p>the last two pleas, if the averments are proved, the plaintiff has certainly put himself out
</p>
<p>of Court. It must have been seen whether the defendant has failed to prove the justifiable
</p>
<p>occasion, warranted by the occasion, whether the Maharajas are preceptors of the Hindu
</p>
<p>rehgion, whether they hold a high position as Brahmins, &c. It certainly could not be that
</p>
<p>this pretended teacher is one whose principles, both religious and moral, are to be tried by
</p>
<p>a different standard from that applied to all other suitors of the Court  principles which
</p>
<p>make good evil and evil good, adultery lawful, and vice to be pursued with the desire of
</p>
<p>one who seeks eternal salvation ! 1 The learned counsel argued that this person is one who,
</p>
<p>committed to such practices of immorality, as came into light during the course of the trial,
</p>
<p>was disentitled to any redress for the alleged libel. The defendant is a member of the
</p>
<p>sect to which the plaintiff belongs ; its immoralities and the licentiousness of those who
</p>
<p>pretended to be religious teachers, attracted his attention from an early age ; he set himself
</p>
<p>to the study of the sacred books, and instituted enquiries and researches into the past his-
</p>
<p>tory of the Maharajas, the result of which forced upon him the necessity, as it would
</p>
<p>have forced itself upon any other reflecting mind, ot exposing this rotten and monstrous
</p>
<p>system, and of laying bare its enormities and the excesses of its professors, to those who
</p>
<p>were aware of its existence as \ve\i as to those who haJ recently withdrawn from its
</p>
<p>influence. Keferring to the plea of justification Mr. Anstey urged that, if it appears from the
</p>
<p>plaintiffs own evidence, offered in rebuttal, that the enormities and practices alleged
</p>
<p>against him do exist, and if he has attempted to grapple with what the defendant says,
</p>
<p>and has failed to disprove it, he certainly has no right to be in court.
</p>
<p>Now, said the learned counsel, let us look to the evidence. It is proved by some of
</p>
<p>plaintiffs own witnesses, and by none even attempted to be disproved, that the passages
</p>
<p>put in as exhibits contain substantially the doctrines of the sect. Some witnesses were

</p>
<p>more positive than others, but there was not one who dared call into question the authen-
</p>
<p>ticity of the books or the correctness of the translations. For present purposes, therefore,
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey would take it for granted that these two points were not at all disputed.
</p>
<p>Now, as to the Maharajas' pretensions to Gudhead, the plaintiff, though he at first, denied
</p>
<p>to be a God himself admitted that the doctrine of the Maharajas being incarnations of the
</p>
<p>Diety was taught in the sacred books used by the sect. Amorous songs, he also admitted
</p>
<p>are addressed to the Maharajas by their female devotees. But, says he, "I deny that
</p>
<p>they sing obscene songs." Probably, to his perverted sense, or rather want of the sense
</p>
<p>of decency or shame, being provoked to unlawful love and those passages containing licen-
</p>
<p>tious sentiments appeared to be lessons of piety and morality ! It was in evidence that
</p>
<p>every Vaishnav is bound to hold the Shree Thackoorjee (the image of God) and^ooroo to be the
</p>
<p>same ; not only to hold, but to cherish the notion with all the religious fervour ot which
</p>
<p>ignorance is capable. That i.s the doctrine ol Huryriajee Maharaj. To make things stilt
</p>
<p>180
</p>
<p>clearer, we have the " Chutoor Slockee," a sacred book of the sect, which inculcates
</p>
<p>that they must regard the gooroo as God, nay, as greater than God ; because, if God
</p>
<p>is displeased, the gooroo interferes and obtains pardon for the sinner ; but if the gooroo
</p>
<p>be displeased, there is no mediator and therefore no pardon ! It is the opinion of
</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson that this man (the Maharaj) is regarded as a mock Christian mediator ! !
</p>
<p>The plaintiff, moreover, in answer to the Chief Justice, stated distinctly that the favors
</p>
<p>from the gooroo are greater than those from God ; and in another place, admitted
</p>
<p>that the obligations to the gooroo are greater than the obligations to God ; because the
</p>
<p>former is the only guide to the Divinity. The witness for the plaintiff, Bhoychund
</p>
<p>Eylall, said that the Shree Thackorjee is equal to the image, and it is admitted by
</p>
<p>the plaintiff himself that the God Krishna can, by faith and by ceremonies, be brought
</p>
<p>into the image, which is an animated Divinity. One v/itness said that the Thackorjee
</p>
<p>is to be worshipped, but that the gooroo is his representative. Jumnadass Sevuklall
</p>
<p>says " we swing the Maharaj, as we cannot touch the image and swing it." Two
</p>
<p>other witnesses go further and say, it is not possible for the Maharaj to commit sin.
</p>
<p>The court was not investigating the doctrines of the ancient religion of the Hindus
</p>
<p>contained in the Veds, which coiuprehends books of philosophy and morality, and which
</p>
<p>is far different from the doctrines of this wretched, miserable, and pestilential sect of
</p>
<p>the Vallabhacharyas. The religion of this sect is a new system set up at a modern
</p>
<p>date ; and it is a distinctly established fact that, in the proportion that these new and
</p>
<p>monstrous doctrines have gone forward, the ancient doctrines of morality have gone
</p>
<p>back and have been superseded. Returning to the evidence adduced for the plaintiff,
</p>
<p>it appears that he at first says, the Maharaj is not regarded as a god, and then,
</p>
<p>subsequently, admits that a minority of the Vaishnavs do regard him as a god.
</p>
<p>But, with the artifice of a perjured witness, he adds that he instructed his followers
</p>
<p>not to worship or consider him as a god. When questioned, however, by the learned
</p>
<p>counsel, if he could name a single person whom he enlightened in the manner alleged
</p>
<p>by him, he (plaintiff) took time and said he could not recollect any person to whom
</p>
<p>he conveyed the valuable instruction. On the other hand, he admits that Goverdhun-
</p>
<p>dass was employed by him to publish books and pamphlets in the name of the
</p>
<p>Vaishnav Dhurmprasaruk Society, of which he (plaintiff) is the founder, patron, and
</p>
<p>presiding genius. In one of the publications of this Society, a passage occurs to the
</p>
<p>following effect : " The whole Universe is pervaded by God's spirit, when God plays
</p>
<p>with his creatures he is simply at play with his own spirit, and consequently the sin

</p>
<p>of adultery does not affect him. The sin of adultery is ordained for the world." If
</p>
<p>every Maharaj is considered an impeccable being, absorbed into the Divine essence by
</p>
<p>the ceremony of Brahma-sambandh, by which the sins of the eleven organs are washed
</p>
<p>away, and the agent is absolved, then it follows that these abandoned and licentious
</p>
<p>men (the Maharajas) may do what they like, however immoral and abominable the
</p>
<p>thing may be. Adultery with the Maharaj is, accordingly, " ras lila" and " rua
</p>
<p>ruttee :" the god  this atrocious hypocrite, the Maharaj  is simply at amorous dalliance
</p>
<p>with his own spirit ! (The learned counsel here commented upon another passage in
</p>
<p>the pamphlet alluded to, and proceeded to say.) The meaning of this is clear, that
</p>
<p>adultery between creature and creature is one thing, but that adultery between God
</p>
<p>and the creature is sinful neither to God nor to the creature ! ! When with these
</p>
<p>abominable, blasphemous doctrines is coupled the belief of the sect that Krishna is an
</p>
<p>incarnation of God, that the Shree Thackorjee is the living image of Krishna, that the
</p>
<p>181
</p>
<p>"Maharaj himself is an incarnation of God, and when these articles of creed are pro-
</p>
<p>pagated through the sacred books, what can the people think but that eternal salvation
</p>
<p>is to be gained by direct carnal intercourse with the God Incarnate's representative on
</p>
<p>earth  the Maharaj ! ! The people are told distinctly : " If you want salvation, get
</p>
<p>impregnated, as the gopees were, through the representative of God, for, in your
</p>
<p>present state, you cannot approach or be acceptable to God." The same doctrine is
</p>
<p>inculcated in the book of Haryriajee Maharaj, " God abides in the houses of the
</p>
<p>Vaishnavs," &c. &c. But, says the plaintiff, Krishna was a child between five and
</p>
<p>eleven years of age when engaged in amorous sport with the gopees. The learned
</p>
<p>counsel was not here to explain all the absurdities of the Hindu pantheon ; but there
</p>
<p>was one passage to place the point beyond dispute, " Thereupon the maidens laid
</p>
<p>Krishna on the bed and enjoyed him." Proceeding with his observations, the learned
</p>
<p>counsel said that, according to the doctrines of the sect, no sense of shame should
</p>
<p>intervene between the Maharaj and his devotees ; and as to public opinion, such an
</p>
<p>absurdity in Bombay was an abomination to him ! According to one of the sacred
</p>
<p>books, the Maharaj is a bemg whose chief object is amorous sport.
</p>
<p>The learned gentleman now came to another branch of the doctrines of the sect
</p>
<p> the practices of the Maharajas  with regard to which it became a matter of difficulty,
</p>
<p>for very obvious reasons, for the defendant to prove all to which the truth entitled
</p>
<p>him. The principal doctrine inculcated is, that the Vaishnav must not see any fault
</p>
<p>in the gooroos ; he must not divulge any of the gooroo's secrets ; and if he saw any-
</p>
<p>thing bad, he must regard it. as " myaia, a delusion." Acting up to this doctrine,
</p>
<p>we had one of the plaintiff's witnesses, jSTurrotumdass, telling the Court, " I would
</p>
<p>not believe anything against the Maharaj ;" another witness, Moonsookh Khoosal, who
</p>
<p>said " I have the same respect for the Maharaj as ever before ;" another who says,
</p>
<p>" I consider the gooroo equal to God, and he cannot commit sin ; Kaghojee Nathoojee,
</p>
<p>who says, " It is a sin to give evidence against the Maharaj. Mathooradass Lovvjee
</p>
<p>committed a sin when he gave evidence against the Maharaj. The Maharaj can do
</p>
<p>nothing wrong." Damodhar Madhowjee swore to the following effect. " If any member
</p>
<p>of the Vallabhacharya sect is found to entertain opinions contrary to the doctrines of
</p>
<p>the sect, we would not believe him ; I would not associate with him. It a person gave
</p>
<p>evidence of adultery against the Maharaj I would not speak to him." The evidence of
</p>
<p>this witness, who is a Marjadee, Mr. Anstey considered to be very material. He also
</p>
<p>admitted that there were persons who believed the Maharajas to be guilty of adultery,
</p>

</p>
<p>that there was a " bundobust" to be made to prevent evidence of such adultery being
</p>
<p>given, and that his reply was, there was no time for it. It is proved by the plaintiff,
</p>
<p>Mr. Anstey went on to say, that the one hundred names of God and the Maharaj
</p>
<p>are the same ; that the devotees eat the dust of the Maharaj 's feet ; that they show
</p>
<p>greater reverence to him than to the image ; that in some of the rites the same
</p>
<p>homage is paid to him as to God ; that the Maharaj is worshipped in other ways
</p>
<p>peculiar to the sect, &c.
</p>
<p>Eeferring, again, to the dedication of " tun, mun, and dhun," the learned counsel
</p>
<p>said no attempt had been made to rebut the statement of Dr. Bhavvoo Dajee that in no
</p>
<p>other sect is such a dedication enjoined. The " muntra," or " gaetri," is in other sects
</p>
<p>recited mentally and laid up in the heart, whereas the Vallabhacharya people are made to
</p>
<p>repeat to the gooroo a " muntra" appropriate to the monstrous doctrines of the sect. The
</p>
<p>182
</p>
<p>meaning of this dedication is indeed very large, and is made clearer by the doctrine that
</p>
<p>Krishna can be approached through the Maharaj or the image. The dedication to Krishna,
</p>
<p>therefore, is made acceptable through the Maharaj, his representative. While in other
</p>
<p>sects, the office of gooroo is attained to by learning and other accomplishments, in the
</p>
<p>Vallabhacharya sect it is hereditary and inalienable, though the gooroo may be the greatest
</p>
<p>idiot in creation. The members of the sect believe it to be criminal to give evidence
</p>
<p>against the Maharaj, and, on the other hand, meritorious to give false evidence in his
</p>
<p>behalf. The belief is a distinct conclusion from the same common premise, vi^., that the
</p>
<p>Maharaj is incapable of committing sin and that he is above the sin of adultery. Some of
</p>
<p>the witnesses have clearly stated that the old Shastras have been jjro tanto superseded by
</p>
<p>the doctrines of stories such as those of the 252 and 84. Whether they are allegorical
</p>
<p>or not, is a matter of little moment : the plaintiff" himself did not dare call them allegori-
</p>
<p>cal, but said they were given as examples. According to him, adulterine love is the most
</p>
<p>appropriate where with to approach the Almighty. Dr. Bhawoo Dajee, whose evidence the
</p>
<p>plaintiff" was called to rebut, states distinctly that he knows the stories are understood liter-
</p>
<p>ally. Now, so blind is the faith of the followers in the doctrines of these stories and the
</p>
<p>sacred books that Gopaldass Madhowdass, the brother of the ever-to-be-sufficiently-com-
</p>
<p>memorated Justice of the Peace, Vurjeevundass, stated that " If the Shastras enjoined the
</p>
<p>off'cring of women, I would believe in the doctrine !" The plaintiff, probably from a
</p>
<p>sense of terror in the presence of Englishmen and men of intelligence, said he was not a
</p>
<p>god and was not worsliipped as such by his followers, a statement which he contradicted
</p>
<p>in the cross-examination, and to which, therefore, the Counsel trusted, the Court would
</p>
<p>attach no weight whatever.
</p>
<p>Turning to the question whether the Maharajas are preceptors of religion, the learned
</p>
<p>gentleman remarked the fact was too well established to require any comnient, that they
</p>
<p>never instructed their followers in anything and that all their preaching was confined to the
</p>
<p>" muntra" of a few words pronounced at the performance of the " kanthee" ceremony.
</p>
<p>Then as to their learing the witness most friendly to the plaintiff sold that Jeevunjee Maha-
</p>
<p>raj is the only exception, and that the rest are ignorant persons. There was not even an-
</p>
<p>attempt to prove the allegation in the plaint that they are the preceptors of religion and hold
</p>
<p>a high position as Brahmins. And this is the preceptor of religion who has been damnified
</p>
<p>in his faith and his character as preceptor, who says " I know more of Sanscrit than
</p>
<p>I did before the libel !" There Lordships had, moreover, a test of his learning ; he could
</p>
<p>not give the names of the different Veds, and as to the number of the Brahmanas he had
</p>

</p>
<p>no idea whatever. The plaintiff' called a number of witnesses as to his character, but
</p>
<p>before proceeding to a consideration of this part of the evidence, the learned counsel must
</p>
<p>say it was no part of the defendants case that these licentious and immoral practices were
</p>
<p>indulged in secretly. The plaintiff attempted to prove that he was never alone, but whe-
</p>
<p>ther he be always alone or surrounded by a crowd of attendants, it is proved that the
</p>
<p>Maharajas are guilty of adultery and immoral practices. Veljee, one of his disciples, was
</p>
<p>every moment with him, and, he said the Maharaj had no povvor to send him out of his
</p>
<p>presence even for an instant. If the Maharaj ordered his personal attendants to leave him
</p>
<p>alone for a few moments, his order would not be obeyed by his own servants. The ,
</p>
<p>question arises here that, either this man's evidence is altogether true or altogether
</p>
<p>false ; there is no medium ; and it must be admitted or rejected in its en-
</p>
<p>tirety. It argues a common purpose and a combination throughout the rest of the case to
</p>
<p>secure that purpose ; it shows common fraud and is unworthy of belief The plaintiff
</p>
<p>183
</p>
<p>contradicts Veljee in an important point, and says there were two females only in the
</p>
<p>zenana and there was no male servant. The sepoy at the door of the zenana is a mere
</p>
<p>fiction of the sepoy's brain. The plaintiff's two wives were each of the age of nine or nine
</p>
<p>and a half years at the time of his marriage ; he denied the virtues of a Sanyasee ; and it was
</p>
<p>for the Court to judge whether, not being a Sanyasee, he would abstain from unlawful
</p>
<p>intercourse until his wives became of age. The plaintiff as well as every one of his
</p>
<p>witnesses had not up to this moment heard of the existence of Rus mundlees ;
</p>
<p>some of them had not even so much as heard the name ; and then, as to the
</p>
<p>adultery of the Maharajas, there was the same tenour of evidence. Again Mr. Anstey
</p>
<p>would say it was impossible to refine that evidence or to accept between the two courses ;
</p>
<p>the Court must either receive it altogether or reject it altogether.
</p>
<p>All the witnesses for the rebuttal of the defendants' case broke down signally. Isearly
</p>
<p>all of them were cautioned ; two were fined ; one was sent to gaol ; one was under three
</p>
<p>years' surveillance of the police at Baroda ; and another formed the subject of a report to
</p>
<p>Government for being concerned in a double murder I ! Th s was the really unexception-
</p>
<p>able character of the plaintiff's witnesses, many of whom had suddenly transported themselves
</p>
<p>to Bombay within the last month or two, for purposes, apparently, of this trial. As to
</p>
<p>the defendants' witnesses, on the contrary, not a single aspersion was attempted to be cast
</p>
<p>upon any of them and not a single question was put as to their character. Considered,
</p>
<p>again, from another point of view the evidence for the plaintiff was wholly partial and
</p>
<p>interested evidence ; for every one of his witnesses was a member of the sect and a
</p>
<p>devotee of the Maharaj. The plaintfF and all his witnesses had great interests at stake.
</p>
<p>If the Court's verdict goes against him, were is he ? asked the learned counsel. Gone,
</p>
<p>swept from the face of the earth. There is not a single female in the sect whose honor
</p>
<p>is not under a shade unless it could be shown that she has fortunately been free of an
</p>
<p>improper intercourse with her religious instructors. These were the motives for the
</p>
<p>members of the sect to put forth their best effects in favor of the Maharaj, while those
</p>
<p>who came forward now, and who were not indicated in the Bhattia case, had every thing
</p>
<p>to fear from a verdict adverse to the plaintiff. And though the Court would not allow
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould's notes in that case to be put in, it was the fact that not one of the
</p>
<p>plaintiffs witnesses dared utter a word either against the justice of the sentence passed
</p>
<p>upon the nine conspirators or against the truthfulness of the witnesses for the prosecution.
</p>
<p>Here we had a lot of perjured witnesses and a body of suborned evidence for the reasons
</p>
<p>already explained ; and every exertion was made to mislead the mind of the Court. These

</p>
<p>lot of witnesses, drawn from so many different places within the last three or four months,
</p>
<p>had heard nothing bad against the Maharaj. The absence of bad character, however, the
</p>
<p>learned counsel observed, is not a test of good character. Dr. Bhawoo Dajee stated that
</p>
<p>the plaintiff had a bad character. Dr. Bhawoo had nothing to gain, but certainly much
</p>
<p>4o lose in coming forward to give his evidence, for he has an extensive practice among the
</p>
<p>Hindus and among members of the sect ; whereas the plaintiffs witnesses had every thing
</p>
<p>to lose in the adverse issue of the trial, and therefore it was that they made every possible
</p>
<p>effort to injure the defendant's case. There was a singular combination among the plaintiflTs
</p>
<p>witnesses, and according to the doctrine of the " myaia,"' delusion, they could not believe
</p>
<p>what their eyes made them acquainted with. Really, said the learned counsel, the plaintiffs
</p>
<p>witnesses were men who, according to the proverb, ought to have long memories. (The
</p>
<p>learned counsel here commented upon the rebutting evidence of some of the witnesses for
</p>
<p>the plaintiff.) Nov;, as to the pas.'^age containing the alleged libel, the Court had the
</p>
<p>184
</p>
<p>opinions of the three persons that it was no libel ;  the defendant who knows the sense of
</p>
<p>what he wrote, Dr. Wilson, and Dr. Bhawoo Dajee. There seldom was an occasion when
</p>
<p>a witness was subjected to a closer and more searching examination than Dr. Bhawoo Dajee
</p>
<p>was by the Court, and there seldom was an occasion when views, expressed at first, were
</p>
<p>more consistently adhered to than by this gentleman. With regard to the meaning of
</p>
<p>words in some of the translations, Mr. Anstey regretted to mention that an officer of the
</p>
<p>Court (Mr. Narayen Dinanathjee) should have dreamed of referring to a Persian dictionary
</p>
<p>for the meaning of a Sanscrit word, and giving a meaning to the word " vehvichar"
</p>
<p>(adultery) which it was not capable of. After all, the result was to establish the accuracy
</p>
<p>of Mr. Balajee's translation.
</p>
<p>Now, as to the immoralities of the plaintiff, the learned gentleman would draw a
</p>
<p>distinction between the specific acts mentioned in the pleas, which were abundantly proved,
</p>
<p>and the facts which came out in the course of the examination. Making a few remarks
</p>
<p>upon the distinction thus drawn, the learned counsel proceeded to observe that if the
</p>
<p>plaintiff's witnesses were men ot credit, if they had not disgraced themselves, and even if
</p>
<p>they obtained credit for their statements, the simple effect of their evidence would be, that
</p>
<p>they did not hear anything against the plaintiff. But notwithstanding all that, it would
</p>
<p>be no answer to the positive and reliable evidence on the other side. The evidence on one
</p>
<p>side did not exclude the evidence adduced on the other. Besides, there was no doubt
</p>
<p>whatever as to the particular disease from which the plaintiff suffered, after the confession
</p>
<p>he made to Lukhmidass Khimjee and Dr. Dhirajaram. The plaintiff, in his cross examination,
</p>
<p>admitted having been examined by three medical gentlemen, one of whom refused to come
</p>
<p>and give evidence in court that he (the Maharaj) was free from any traces of the disease.
</p>
<p>Where are those medical gentlemen ? the learned counsel would ask. In the absence of
</p>
<p>their evidence, Mr. Anstey would say it were no hypocriticism if the defendant, through
</p>
<p>him suggested that the traces of the disease were probably found in the plaintiff. The
</p>
<p>probabilities were against the supposition of the existence of any malice in the two gentlemen
</p>
<p>who swore to the plaintiff's being afflicted with the disease. What had they to gain by
</p>
<p>a false disclosure ? Both had an extensive practice among the Vaishnavs, which they
</p>
<p>would not willingly forsake. Moreover, the delay of nine months in the examination to
</p>
<p>which the plaintiff thought proper, at the eleventh hour, to submit himself to, was
</p>
<p>inexplicable. If the whole case, Mr. Anstey argued, depended upon the venereal
</p>
<p>affection, and upon the plaintiff''s self accusations, there was more than enough to oust
</p>
<p>him from the Court.

</p>
<p>Now, look at the position of the defendant. He is a member of the Vallabhacharya
</p>
<p>sect, he sees the error of his ways in earlier life, and withdrav.'s from the blighting
</p>
<p>influence of the doctrines of his sect. He contrasts in the course of time a friendship
</p>
<p>with the plaintiff, and engages with him in the discussion of the several public,
</p>
<p>questions. Discussing upon the question of the practices of the Maharajas and the
</p>
<p>doctrines of the sect, he addresses a separate expostulation to the plaintiff, who had
</p>
<p>set himself up as an earnest propagator of their religion, to separate himself from the
</p>
<p>abominations of the sect, and to warn and admonish his brother Maharajas. The
</p>
<p>learned gentleman begged the Court to consider the difference in the position of the
</p>
<p>parties ; and above all, to consider the serious difficulties which might overtake the
</p>
<p>defendant in the event of an adverse verdict. Let him suffer by all means if his
</p>
<p>case was futile, but the learned Counsel submitted that it was fully made out in every
</p>
<p>185
</p>
<p>important particular. In conclusion, Mr. Anstey trusted confidently that their Lordships
</p>
<p>would, by their verdict, place the liberty of the press upon an inaccessible height,
</p>
<p>safe from the attack of the enemies of morality, of the well-being of society, and of
</p>
<p>the progress of enlightenment.
</p>
<p>Ticenty -third Dai/, Tuesday, 'ith March 1862.
</p>
<p>Mr, Bayley this day rose to make a general reply to the defendants' case. The learned
</p>
<p>Counsel considered it his duty to relieve the plaintiff from the filthy charges trumpeted forth against
</p>
<p>him in the world. This was a case, so far as he could discover, unparalled in the history of
</p>
<p>jurisprudence, and he would shew that this was only an infamous and trumped up charge, but
</p>
<p>that the aspersions that had been uttered against the plaintiff were totally unfounded, and that
</p>
<p>no other verdict for the plaintiff must be the result. No fewer than sixty-three witnes-
</p>
<p>ses had been examined in this case  thirty-two for the plaintiff and thirty-one for the
</p>
<p>defendant ; of the thirty-one witnesses which defendant had called, only four spoke as
</p>
<p>to the impropriety of conduct of the plaintiff ; they were Kallabhoy Lalloobhoy, Dr.
</p>
<p>Dhirajram, Luckmidass Khimjee, and Chuttoorbhooj. The learned Counsel asked the
</p>
<p>Court to recollect the place where this trial was going on, for, if there be any country
</p>
<p>there was no country like India where witnesses could be so easily procured to sup-
</p>
<p>port trumped up charges. It was said that the plaintiff had no locus standi, but
</p>
<p>this argument had been addressed to the Court months ago, and it could not be
</p>
<p>listened to now. The learned Counsel said that his client was here suing in his
</p>
<p>capacity of a British subject, and he referred to the 37th clause of the charter of
</p>
<p>this Court. The mere suggestion of such an objection must have shewn what little
</p>
<p>further the Counsel for the defence had in his case. To take a comprehensive view of
</p>
<p>the whole case, take the respective position of the plaintiff and the defendant at
</p>
<p>the time the plea was put upon record. Defendant must have believed that plaintiff
</p>
<p>would not break through the rules of his caste to appear in Court to give evidence.
</p>
<p>No Maharaj had sense and courage enough as Mr. Bayley 's client to face the Counsel
</p>
<p>who opposed him. Plaintiff had been subpoened by the defendant and why was he
</p>
<p>not called by him. These charges were trumped up against the plaintiff by Kalloo-
</p>
<p>bhoy. Dr. Dhirajram, Luckmidass, and Chuttoorbhooj. The simple question which the
</p>
<p>Court had to determine was libel or no libel, or whether the special pleas of justifica-
</p>
<p>tion were proved or not. It was perfectly immaterial whether plaintiff had the disease
</p>
<p>or not, but the question was whether the special plea was proved or not. In the
</p>
<p>case of Queen vs. Neicham, there were five and twenty charges in the plea against

</p>
<p>Dr. Kolly ; the jury found a few of the charges proved, and verdict was asked for
</p>
<p>the defendant ; Lord Campbell, however, held that the whole plea should have been
</p>
<p>proved, and that there could be no partial finding for defendant. Mr. Bayley therefore
</p>
<p>contended that unless every little allegation was proved, the defendant could not be
</p>
<p>said to have established his pleas. The Court had already expressed an opinion that
</p>
<p>there was libel and the learned Coun-el hoped that it would not change that opinion.
</p>
<p>\^Mr. Justice Arnould remarked that the Court held that opinion on the facts then
</p>
<p>before it, but since then more facts had transpired, and it was for the Court to see
</p>
<p>24
</p>
<p>186
</p>
<p>wliether there was justifying occasion or not.] Mr. Bayley said that so far as the
</p>
<p>evidence had gone there was nothing to shew a justifying occasion. It was no
</p>
<p>justification of a libel to say that it had been previously published as a libel. As to
</p>
<p>the question of justifiable occasion, what was the relative position of the two
</p>
<p>parties ? Defendant had no acquaintance with the plaintiff, nor was he himself aware
</p>
<p>of the alleged immoralities of any of the Maharajas, with the exception that when a
</p>
<p>boy he observed some improper conduct on the part of Jeevunjee Maharaj. Defendant
</p>
<p>said in the witness-box that he did not believe in the Bhagwut Gita, but it was
</p>
<p>upon that very book that he was sworn in the box. So he came here in a different
</p>
<p>position from that of a man who sincerely believed in the sacred books. So we have
</p>
<p>defendant who does not believe in his religion, and we have plaintiff" who is a sincere
</p>
<p>follower of his religion and who is in a position only inferior to Native Princes. The
</p>
<p>evidence of character called by the learned Counsel infinitely outweighed the allegations
</p>
<p>made by the witnesses for defendant. If the evidence of bad character be anything 
</p>
<p>for it is nothing  it was fully and doubly met by the evidence of good character. No
</p>
<p>man's character would be safe, if the evidence of the boys Kallabhoy, Chuttoorbhooj,
</p>
<p>and Dhirajram, were to be believed, especially in this country where witnesses are prone
</p>
<p>to invent charges of infamous character. The evidence of these witnesses and that of
</p>
<p>the dealer in piece goods, Lukmidass Khimjee, was not entitled to credence against the
</p>
<p>evidence of a man in the position of the plaintiff and his witnesses. Previous to the
</p>
<p>publication of the libel, an acrimonious and bitter discussion was raging on the subject
</p>
<p>of religion, and attacks were made on the ancient faith by editors and young reformers.
</p>
<p>In the course of this trial, questions had been put to witnesses on religious points, and
</p>
<p>they had been asked whether they believed in plaintiff" as a gooroo or an incarnation
</p>
<p>of God ; and fault was found with their answers. But the learned Counsel observed,
</p>
<p>that it was all very well for us habituated to European modes of thinking to give a
</p>
<p>categorical answer to a question, but the universal mode for a native witness was to
</p>
<p>answer a question, in the form of a question. Plaintiff who is held in high respect by
</p>
<p>his followers has enjoyed good character ; he never committed any of the acts imputed
</p>
<p>to him ; and all the charges levelled against him had no real foundation, but were
</p>
<p>mere rumours suggested by native ingenuity. The marvellous critical powers of that
</p>
<p>Calvinistic divine. Dr. Wilson, whom the learned Counsel did not give much credit,
</p>
<p>found fault with the translation of the libel and described a word to be in suspensive
</p>
<p>participle a participle which Mr. Bayley never heard of before. From the interest

</p>
<p>which Dr. Wilson took in this case, the learned Counsel believed that he must have
</p>
<p>supplied defendant with the raw materials out of which the sixth plea was constructed.
</p>
<p>Plaintiff" denied the several ridiculous acts imputed to him. Did he distribute water wrung
</p>
<p>out of his dhotee to his followers ? No, he said. Did he press the breast of a dying
</p>
<p>person with his foot ? He said No, and he denied several such acts which were attempted
</p>
<p>to be fastened on him. Defendant himself never saw the filth and mass of obscenity
</p>
<p>which his witnesses said they heard the Maharajas to have committed. The learned
</p>
<p>Counsel said that credence should be accorded to plaintiff who is a moral and religious man,
</p>
<p>while defendant was a man of no religion and consequently not worthy of belief. It was
</p>
<p>evident that the evidence of bad character would not be true, because a person leading
</p>
<p>an open life like the plaintiff could not have committed such enormities without being
</p>
<p>known. Plaintiff held the highest rank among his sect and was treated with honors which
</p>
<p>defendan t was never likely to obtain in his life. It was in evidence that "he was received
</p>
<p>187
</p>
<p>with much pomp and high honors by the Gaekwar when he went on a visit to Baroda.
</p>
<p>The relative position in life of the plaintiff and the defendant shewed that there was
</p>
<p>rancour existing on the part of the latter who seceded from his religion. The learned
</p>
<p>Counsel therefore said that whether the publication be justify able or not, the defendant must
</p>
<p>have believed at the time he wrote it that it was a libel and that it was not justifyable.
</p>
<p>Defendant confessed that it was true that it was a libel and that every fact in it was
</p>
<p>true. If he believed it was a libel against plaintiff only, why did he not say so in
</p>
<p>his letter in reply to the notice served upon him by plaintiff ? The learned Counsel
</p>
<p>was of opinion that defendant did believe that the libel was levelled against the
</p>
<p>plaintiff and his object was to bring him into disrepute. Defendant had ample
</p>
<p>opportunities of retracting it, but he did not avail himself of them ; on the contrary
</p>
<p>the manner in which he carried on his case shewed that he aimed at depriving
</p>
<p>plaintiff of the sympathy of the court and his followers. Plaintiff might have, if he wished,
</p>
<p>prosecuted defendant criminally for libel, but he did not do so and gave defendant every
</p>
<p>opportunity to prove his case. Under all these circumstances plaintiff was entitled to ask
</p>
<p>for heavy damages. Mr. Bayley then proceeded to address the Court in the considera-
</p>
<p>tion of the evidence. He said that two considerations presented themselves on the
</p>
<p>whole of the evidence, namely, that nine-tenths of the whole evidence was merely composed
</p>
<p>of hearsay, and that the small portion of it which related to the acts of plaintiff with regard
</p>
<p>to the libel comprised the testimony of four persons only. In like manner the evidence
</p>
<p>miorht be divided into two branches, one forming an enquiry into doctrines of the Val-
</p>
<p>labhacharya sect, and the other relating to the practices of the Maharaj. Now in con-
</p>
<p>sidering this case, the Court would recollect the marked difference between one class of
</p>
<p>evidence and the other. As to hearsay evidence, the whole of it related to the prac-
</p>
<p>tices of the sect and the belief of the sect as to those practices. With the exception
</p>
<p>of the plaintiff and one or two of his witnesses, there was not a single member of the
</p>
<p>Vallabhacharya sect examined by the other side to give a satisfactory account of the opi-
</p>
<p>nions of the sect. Let us look at the class of witnesses who had been called to give
</p>
<p>evidence as to the doctrines and practices of the sect. We have Dr. Wilson, for com-
</p>
<p>menting upon whom the learned Counsel was found fault with in public prints for using
</p>
<p>language which he had purposely used. Coming as a Missionary to draw people from
</p>
<p>their religion and holding a very low opinion of the Hindoo religion in general. Dr.
</p>
<p>Wilson would naturally take an unfair view of the opinions and practices of the Val-
</p>
<p>labhacharya sect. Would a Roman Catholic go to a member of the Scotch Church  a

</p>
<p>Church peculiai'ly narrow-minded  for the purpose of gaining knowledge of the doctrines
</p>
<p>of the Church of Rome ? So, is it fair to go to a person who comes to convert people
</p>
<p>to his own religion, and expect from him a candid opinion as to the practices of the
</p>
<p>Vallabhacharya sect. Dr. Wilson said that the Maharajas bore a low character and given
</p>
<p>to obscene practices. The learned Counsel referred to the chapter 292 of the Penal Code
</p>
<p>which expressly provides an exception for the peculiar customs and usages of this coun-
</p>
<p>try ; by it all obscene books and publications are made punishable by fine or impri-
</p>
<p>sonment, but an exception is made for pictures and representations on the walls of
</p>
<p>temples and in religious books. Here then, said the learned Counsel, was a recogni-
</p>
<p>tion of such pictures by the law. Defendant and Dr. Wilson were both antagonistic
</p>
<p>to the Vallabhacharya belief, and consequently their evidence was not entitled to credit.
</p>
<p>The learned Counsel then said that the libel might be divided into parts ; the first
</p>
<p>part containing an hic^torical comment on the sect, and the second, a personal attack
</p>
<p>188
</p>
<p>on the Maharaj. To prove the pleas of justification, the defendant must prove first the
</p>
<p>general practices of the sect as stated in the plea, and having done that, he must
</p>
<p>prove that plaintiff was guilty of the specific acts imputed to him. The Court had to
</p>
<p>consider whether the pleas of justification were proved, and if there was any doubt as
</p>
<p>to any one of the allegations, then both the pleas must be found in favour of the
</p>
<p>plaintiff. A great part of the examination of witnesses, and arguments were directed
</p>
<p>to the point that plaintiff came here not as a man but as something more, but the
</p>
<p>learned Counsel asserted that plaintiff was a man and entitled to respect, and entitled
</p>
<p>to more respect than was shewn to him in the course of the trial. Plaintiff very truly
</p>
<p>described his peculiar character and stated that he was regarded as a Gooroo by his
</p>
<p>followers. It was perfectly admitted that the old Hindu religion does not exist in its
</p>
<p>original pure state, and therefore the modern state of society did justify Dr. Wilson
</p>
<p>in calling the Vallabhacharya sect a new sect. There were mere rumours of persons
</p>
<p>who had separated from that persuasion, and there were no witnesses of extensive
</p>
<p>learning in Sanscrit, except Dr. Wilson, called to prove the alleged recent foundation
</p>
<p>of the sect. Defendant Karsandass Mooljee himself was totally ignorant of the Sanscrit
</p>
<p>language, nor was his witness Luckmidass Khimjee learned enough to pronounce an opi-
</p>
<p>nion on the point. Now, the learned Counsel said, this was not a sect which had
</p>
<p>sprung up within the last few years as Mormonism had done ; it was older than Pro-
</p>
<p>testantism, and therefore it was unfair to look from a European point of view upon
</p>
<p>those practices which even the legislature had sanctioned. There was nothing shewn in
</p>
<p>the trial that these practices had any foundation, there was only hearsay evidence upon
</p>
<p>that point, and mere rumours is not evidence. It was somewhat peculiar that Dr.
</p>
<p>Wilson with all his learning, and with all his knowledge and languages dead and alive
</p>
<p>did not draw distinction between works in Sanscrit and their version in Brij Bhasha.
</p>
<p>Plaintiff, however very properly pointed out that Brij Bhasha works were not regarded as
</p>
<p>religious authorities, unless they corresponded with the Sanscrit originals. Considerable
</p>
<p>attempt had been made to blacken the character of the plaintiff in every particular.
</p>
<p>When we have a man thus abused and villified, we must look to that passage in his
</p>
<p>life with reference to the establishment of a Sanscrit school at Surat. It was esta-
</p>
<p>blished and proved beyond a doubt that he established the school and defrayed its ex-
</p>
<p>penses. It was no part of his religion to establish a school  a school not for teaching the obscene
</p>
<p>books, but for teaching the Sanscrit language. We have thus plaintiff in a position
</p>
<p>not inculcathig immoral principles, but promoting the cause of education by establish-
</p>

</p>
<p>ing and assisting schools. Would the Court believe him, or believe the parcel of re-
</p>
<p>formers who attack through plaintiff the religion which they have renounced. It was
</p>
<p>a remarkable circumstance that not one of the witnesses who spoke as to the personal
</p>
<p>character of the plaintiff, in any way corroborate each other. In dealing with this class
</p>
<p>of evidence we have isolated transaction spoken to by isolated witnesses, and there is
</p>
<p>no confirmation of the testimony of one witness by that of the other. No evidence was
</p>
<p>adduced, nor an endeavour made to obtain the evidence of persons in whose presence
</p>
<p>these three witnesses saw indecent transactions take place. Plaintiff negatived these trans-
</p>
<p>actions, and it therefore rested with the defendant to have produced the witnesses pre-
</p>
<p>sent. The evidence of the boy Kallabhoy Lullabhoy, who was said to be a witness
</p>
<p>to an immoral act of the Maharaj entirely broke down ; this boy does not relate the
</p>
<p>circumstance to his father or any other person, but he tells it only to the poet Ner-
</p>
<p>muddashunker who is antagonistic to the plaintiff. The learned Counsel then adverting
</p>
<p>189
</p>
<p>to the subject of Mnntra or dedication vow, wliich formed a good deal of the plea,
</p>
<p>said that that had been entirely disproved ; the only marvel was that a great many
</p>
<p>more witnesses were not called to prove the charges against the plaintiff. Plaintiff ne-
</p>
<p>gatived these allegations, and considering his high position, he was entitled to the con-
</p>
<p>sideration of the Court. With regard to Goculnathjee's commentary, the learned Counsel
</p>
<p>remarked that the poet Nermuddashunker pronounced an opinion upon one part of it when
</p>
<p>he had not read the whole of the commentary. His opinion was worth little or
</p>
<p>nothing, for he was still a boy and had yet much to learn ; he was a poet in hj^
</p>
<p>own little sphere, and therefore incompetent to take a common sense view of a religi-
</p>
<p>ous doctrine. The witness Narayen Dinanathjee had read what the poet had not read,
</p>
<p>he had read the whole of tie commentary, and he expressly swore that he had not
</p>
<p>the slightest doubt that the word " Purshotum" mentioned therein, did not mean Maharaj
</p>
<p>but God, and that the dedication vow was addressed to God and not to the Maharaj..
</p>
<p>The poet ventured his reputation as a poet and said that Purshotum was the Maha-
</p>
<p>raj. The Muntra did not bear the construction put upon it by defendant's witnesses,
</p>
<p>and therefore it was perfectly reconcileable with the doctrines of the sect, shewing that
</p>
<p>plaintiff^s religion was not a hypocrisy. The primary object of the dedication is not the
</p>
<p>Maharaj but God, and therefore the monstrous doctrine of dedication and the offering of
</p>
<p>wives and daughters to the Maharaj, falls to the ground. This infamous attempt to
</p>
<p>prejudice the learned Counsel's client among his people and expose his religion had en-
</p>
<p>tirely failed. It was unfair to have put a single isolated passage in a book into the
</p>
<p>hands of a witness and try him by that selected passage, without allowing him to read
</p>
<p>the context. This was a monstrous attempt to mislead the Court upon a most mate-
</p>
<p>rial point, and shewed that the defendant and his witnesses were capable of resorting
</p>
<p>to extreme measures for the purpose of gaining this suit. Now what was the evidence
</p>
<p>as to " Rus Mundli." Most of the witnesses never heard of such a thing, and even
</p>
<p>plaintiff never heard of it. There was not a single witness on this point, except Luk-
</p>
<p>midass Khimjee who said that he was an eye-witness of the transaction of this Mundli,
</p>
<p>Lukmidass goes to the 3]u77dli with his debauched old uncle, he sees the beds let
</p>
<p>down, the light put out, and strangers ordered to withdraw from the room. Now, what
</p>
<p>occurs in the room, no body knows, that is left to the imagination of the witness.
</p>
<p>Are we to believe the uncorroborated testimony of this witness that such monstrous
</p>
<p>acts of immorality are daily perpetrated among the Vallabhacharya sect? It is very
</p>
<p>easy to change the word " Ras" into " Rus" and give a different version of the ex-

</p>
<p>hibition of the " Ras Mundli" which is nothing more than a dramatic representation
</p>
<p>and in which there is nothing improper. A paper had been put into plaintiffs hand,
</p>
<p>and he was asked whether the word " Rus ' appeared there ; he said it did not, it
</p>
<p>was the word " Ras" and his statement was corroborated by the Interpreter of the
</p>
<p>Court. Referring to the evidence of Dr. Wilson, the learned Counsel said that there
</p>
<p>was much verbiage in his answers. Plaintiff gave direct and simple answers to ques-
</p>
<p>tions put to him, while Dr. Wilson gave his evidence in a roundabout way, and the
</p>
<p>Court was often obliged to ask him to give direct answers. Dr. Wilson said a good
</p>
<p>deal about Krishna and the wonderful powers he exhibited when he was of premature
</p>
<p>age, but the learned Counsel remarked that Krishna was not only an object of worship
</p>
<p>among the Vallabhacharyas, but among all the sects throughout India. There was
</p>
<p>nothing definite in the description of the doctrines of the Vallabhacharya sect given by
</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson ; he had no clear perception of it himself. Therefore judging from his point of
</p>
<p>190
</p>
<p>view, nothing was proved by that Doctor inconsistent with the common principles of
</p>
<p>moraUty, and there appeared nothing monstrous in the doctrines of the Vallabhacharaya
</p>
<p>sect. A good deal was expected from Dr. Wilson from the manner in which he
</p>
<p>trumpeted forth in the witness-box his various designations and connections with learned socie-
</p>
<p>ties ; but so far from damaging the plaintiffs case, he had given only a confused and
</p>
<p>hazy account of the Vallabhacharya sect. Then it was said with doctrinal matters, that
</p>
<p>the essay on adulterine love in the " Swadhrama Vurdhuk Magazine" expressly sanc-
</p>
<p>tioned adultery. This article, the learned Counsel said, by no means inculcated the
</p>
<p>practice of adultery. The early part of the essay contained translations of stanzas from
</p>
<p>Sanscrit works and adulterine love was mentioned to illustrate the intensity of
</p>
<p>love. (Reads the translation of the essayj. The learned Counsel asked if there was
</p>
<p>any thing in this article which inculcated the practice of adultery ? The only conclusion
</p>
<p>to be drawn from it was that in the same way as a woman loved her paramour, sa
</p>
<p>we must with such an intensity of love, worship God. The Court would see that the
</p>
<p>justification was not, as it might have been, pointed to a particular part of the libel,
</p>
<p>but it was a justification of the whole of the libel, and that as defendant had entirely
</p>
<p>failed to make out the immoral doctrines which were alleged to have been preached by
</p>
<p>plaintiff, the justification fell to the ground. Plaintiff had shewn that the passages in-
</p>
<p>culcating immoral practices were not translations from Sanscirt works and therefore not
</p>
<p>regarded as religious authorities ; consequently the defence in that point had entirely
</p>
<p>failed. Referring to the book of ten principles, the learned Counsel said that is was a
</p>
<p>mere lecture and not a word of authority. Dr. Wilson with all his learning did not
</p>
<p>give an account of this book, nor was the plaintiff aware of its existence. The learned
</p>
<p>Counsel believed that from beginning to end, the sole object of the defendant was tO'
</p>
<p>gain popularity by exposing the practices of the Maharajas, but in this attempt he had
</p>
<p>failed. He said that no competent person of a standing as high as that of the plain-
</p>
<p>tiff, had been called by the other side to speak to the doctrines and practices of the
</p>
<p>Vallabhacharya sect. Plaintiff had clearly sworn that he never allowed his followers to
</p>
<p>resort to the practices which were imputed to them in refei'ence to him. The learned
</p>
<p>Counsel asked the Court not to judge of the case by a standard of European notions
</p>
<p>of morality and religion. Defendant had not done anything equal to what plaintiff had
</p>
<p>done, defendant was a meie publisher of a newspaper, while plaintiff" had established a
</p>
<p>school and took much interest in the cause of native education. The learned Counsel said
</p>
<p>that the libel was not justified, and if one- fourth of the plea were not proved, the

</p>
<p>Court must find in favour of the plaintiff. A great many things had been introduced
</p>
<p>for the purpose prejudicing the plaintiff in the eyes of the people ; for example, the
</p>
<p>Bhattia " bundobust" with which he had no connection whatever, nor was he pulling
</p>
<p>the strings from behind. There was no attempt or suggestion made in that " bundo-
</p>
<p>bust" to prevent witnesses from giving evidence in this Court. The learned Counsel
</p>
<p>observed that all the evidence with regard to the doctrines and practices of the sect
</p>
<p>was entirely hearsay, and given by persons whose object was to mislead the Court and
</p>
<p>the people. He next contended that all the points in justification of the latter portion
</p>
<p>of the libel were not proved, and that the probabilities were in favour of the inno-
</p>
<p>cence of the party attacked. There was no proof that defendant at the time he wrote
</p>
<p>the article was himself aware that the facts he had put into ihe plea were true.
</p>
<p>Defendant learnt some of these facts from Lukmidass Khimjee which he subsequently
</p>
<p>put into the plea and Lukmidass himself admitted that he did not communicate these
</p>
<p>191
</p>
<p>facts to him until after the action had been filed. Mere supposition of the immoral
</p>
<p>character of a man would not justify the publication of a libel, and subsequent know-
</p>
<p>ledge of such character could not be pleaded in justification. Defendant had sworn that
</p>
<p>he had no ocular proofs of the Maharajas. The testimony of the personal immoralities
</p>
<p>of the plaintiff was confined to the three witnesses already mentioned, and that Dr.
</p>
<p>Bhawoo Dajee's evidence in no way proved what  was asserted by these witnesses. Dr.
</p>
<p>Bhawoo Dajee said a good deal, but what he did not say was far more important ; he
</p>
<p>saw a little, but what he did not see was of far more important. Hecause other
</p>
<p>Maharajas were of loose character, it by no means followed that plaintiff was so too.
</p>
<p>It was a remarkable ci!-cumstance that Dr. Bhawoo Dajee spoke of a conversation
</p>
<p>with plaintiff about a disease and the impression left upon his mind was that it was
</p>
<p>a venereal disease, but he did not treat it so. Now, what was plaintiffs account of
</p>
<p>the disease. He said that he had been subject for years to eruptions or ulcers since
</p>
<p>he had been on a visit to Sind which is a very warm place. Supposing that plaintiff
</p>
<p>had been suffering from the bad disease, was it likely that he would have employed
</p>
<p>Lukmidass Khimjee to call Dr. Bhawoo Dajee, especially when Lukmidass held opinions
</p>
<p>at variance with his. If he did have that disease, where did he get it. It could not
</p>
<p>have been communicated to him by any other than a public woman ; but it would
</p>
<p>be a most improbable thing for a man having such a range of female worshippers at
</p>
<p>his command to have had intercourse with a public woman. Plaintiff was by no
</p>
<p>means an ignoramus, and the examination and cross-examination he stood, must have,
</p>
<p>in Mr. Bayley's opinion created a favourable impression in the mind of the Court. The
</p>
<p>learned Counsel made severe comments on the evidence of Dr. Dhirajram with reference
</p>
<p>to the disease : he denounced it as a simple tissue of falsehoods and unworthy of
</p>
<p>belief. He then said that the evidence of acts imputed to the plaintiff had been so studiously
</p>
<p>connected as to require a thorough sifting. Some of the witnesses as well as the plaintiff
</p>
<p>had sworn positively that golall powder was not thrown in the temple of Luxmee at
</p>
<p>Beyt and they gave reasons for that. The Court had been asked to believe that hor-
</p>
<p>rible and disgusting scene of Bus Mundli depicted by the witness Lukmidass Khimjee.
</p>
<p>It was an isolated fact and highly improbable one, and had received no corroboration from
</p>
<p>any of the witnesses. The learned Council believed the account of the scene to have been
</p>
<p>concocted by Lukmidass, and as it was so filthy and loathsome he thought it necessary to
</p>
<p>pass over it. Witness Lukmidass Khimjee was contradicted in all the specific acts of im-
</p>
<p>morality on part of the plaintiff mentioned by him, and his evidence was nothing more

</p>
<p>than a tissue of falsehoods. The boy Kallabhoy Lulloobhoy gave evidence of a similar
</p>
<p>character. He was a boy only sixteen years of age and he spoke of having had conversa-
</p>
<p>tion with plaintiff three years ago on the subject of adultery, and remarriage of widows.
</p>
<p>Was it to be believed, asked the learned Counsel, that a boy of the age of thirteen should
</p>
<p>hold such a conversation with his Gooroo ? It was also highly improbable that he should
</p>
<p>have been allowed access into a room where plaintiff was said 'to have had improper inter-
</p>
<p>course with a woman. It was an isolated circumstance, and which could not be contra-
</p>
<p>dicted, except by the evidence of plaintiff himself. This boy Kallabhoy appeared to be
</p>
<p>an athiest and on the same footing with the defendant. [3/r. Anstey interrupting.  Defen-
</p>
<p>dant swore that he was not an antheist]. Mr. Bay ley said that for all that he would
</p>
<p>venture to call him an athiest. He said that all the three witnesses who spoke of the im-
</p>
<p>moral acts of the plaintiff were in league with the defendant. Dr. Dhirajram was an in-
</p>
<p>timate friend of the defendant, witness Kullabhoy was Dr. Dhirajram's nephew, and the
</p>
<p>192
</p>
<p>witness Chuttoorbhooj was once a pupil of the defendant. They had concocted the charge
</p>
<p>against the plaintiff, they were not persons of a free and independent character, nor of a
</p>
<p>high class of life. These witnesses spoke of isolated facts, each telling almost the same
</p>
<p>story, and they were not corroborated by each other or by other evidence. Upon them
</p>
<p>alone rested the evidence of the charge against plaintiff. Then came, said the learned
</p>
<p>Counsel a good deal of evidence on the other side as to plaintiff being a man of bad cha-
</p>
<p>racter, but which carried refutation on the face of it. He ventured to say that of the
</p>
<p>thirty-one witnesses examined by the defendant, the evidence resolved into that of only
</p>
<p>three witnesses already alluded to. The learned Counsel next called the attention of the
</p>
<p>Court to the evidence on behalf of the plaintiff and said that all the witnesses gave a
</p>
<p>good character to him and most of them directly contradicted Lukmidass that golall
</p>
<p>was not thrown in the temple of Luxmee. Plaintiff being a man of high character
</p>
<p>and leading an open life, any improper act on his part would have been known to
</p>
<p>these witnesses. He entirely disclaimed the superhuman character ascribed to him. He
</p>
<p>gave a distinct account of the sect, and shewed that he did not believe in the Brij
</p>
<p>Bhasha works unless they corresponded with Sanscrit originals. He denied that he was
</p>
<p>swung as a God, but said that he was swung as a Gooroo. He was asked as to having
</p>
<p>been examined by three doctors during the progress of the trial, and comments were
</p>
<p>made upon the fact of the medical men not having been called for examination. The
</p>
<p>learned Counsel said that in the case of Queen vs. Palmer for poisoning Cook, experi-
</p>
<p>ments had been made with poison on dogs and other animals ; but Lord Campbell and
</p>
<p>the other judges refused to take that evidence. Mr. Bayley said that evidence could
</p>
<p>not be given and it is not fair to draw unfavourable inferences for having withheld
</p>
<p>it. It was ne\er suggested by defendant or his witnesses that plaintiff was a Gooroo
</p>
<p>or preceptor of the old religion. The learned Counsel asked the Court to see whether
</p>
<p>defendant had not characterised plaintiff as a Gooroo in the libel, which he afterward*
</p>
<p>denied in the pleas. Defendant himself stated that Maharajas are in one sense precep-
</p>
<p>tors of religion, and Dr. Wilson said the same thing. There was one witness on the
</p>
<p>other side on whom only the learned Counsel relied  Vinaek Luxmon Shastree of the
</p>
<p>Sudder Adawlut  so favourable was he to the plaintifTs case. This witness said that
</p>
<p>the Vallabhacharya sect did not differ generally with other Hindoo sects, except in
</p>
<p>some minor points. The natural construction put upon the article of the libel by the
</p>
<p>Interpreters of the Court, Messrs. Flynn and Narayen Dinanathjee, was that it con-
</p>
<p>taired a personal imputation upon plaintiff, and the learned Counsel therefore asked the

</p>
<p>Court to support the evidence of its own sworn interpreters, in preference to the
</p>
<p>amateur interpreters, such as Dr. Wilson, who merely believed that it had reference
</p>
<p>to the commentary. The statement of the defendant that he did not make a personal
</p>
<p>attack upon plaintiff, falls to the ground, for, if that was not the intent, why did he not
</p>
<p>withdraw the article and tender an apology when asked to do so As to the libel
</p>
<p>being published on a justifiable occasion, ^to justify it there must be circumstances in
</p>
<p>the mind of the writer, and he must have reasons to know that what he writes was
</p>
<p>true. The simple question was, was this a libel or no libel, on the plaintiff so as to
</p>
<p>lower him in the estimation of the public. If there be no justification, the law im-
</p>
<p>plies malice, and defendant must therefore be subjected to heavy damages for having
</p>
<p>endeavoured to blacken the character of not plaintiff only, but the whole Vallabhacharya
</p>
<p>sect. The learned Counsel said that the Court was bound to assess heavy damages,
</p>
<p>considering the mass of filth and obscenity with which it had been polluted, and the
</p>
<p>193
</p>
<p>endeavours made to bolster up a weak case. The Court was bound to support its
</p>
<p>translation and hold it a libel, and Mr. Bayley maintained that it was a libel without
</p>
<p>a justifiable occasion, for, defendant at the time he wrote it, had no personal know-
</p>
<p>ledge ot the alleged impropriety of conduct on part of the plaintiff, and he could not
</p>
<p>be justified therefore in singling out the plaintiff. On looking at the libel it would
</p>
<p>appear that there was malice on part of the defendant, for he singled out the plain-
</p>
<p>tiff's name, although there was nothing to justify his doing so, not having a personal
</p>
<p>knowledge of the alleged immoral acts. Mr. Bayley repeated that every single material
</p>
<p>fact in the plea of justification must be proved to find in favour of the defendant,
</p>
<p>but he said that that had not been done, and therefore plaintiff was entitled to a
</p>
<p>verdict. The whole of the issues must be found in favour of the plaintiff, if even
</p>
<p>a portion of the plea was not proved. Plaintiff had done everything in his power to
</p>
<p>meet the charge, and he had successfully met the imputation to his character which was
</p>
<p>attempted to be blasted. His antecedents, and his honesty and integrity were not to
</p>
<p>be lost sight of. The learned Counsel in conclusion asked the Court to assess heavy
</p>
<p>damages considering the malicious character of the libel, and the foul attacks made upon
</p>
<p>plaintiff in public prints during the progress of the suit.
</p>
<p>The Court reserved its judgment sine die.

</p>
<p>JUDGMENT.
</p>
<p>Twenty-fourth Day, Tuesday, 22nd April 1862.
</p>
<p>Sir Matthew Sausse, in giving judgment, said : 
</p>
<p>This was an action on the case for the publication of a false and malicious libel
</p>
<p>in the form of an editorial article that appeared on the 21st October 1860 in a
</p>
<p>Guzerattee newspaper published in Bombay called the Salya Prakdsh or the " Light
</p>
<p>of Truih."
</p>
<p>The publication is as follows :  [Reads the article.]
</p>
<p>This publication may be divided under four heads : 
</p>
<p>Istly. So far as it characterizes the sect of Vallabhacharya, as heretical in respect
</p>
<p>of the Ancient Hindoo Religion.
</p>
<p>2ndly. As it attributes to the Maharajs as the Spiritual heads of the sect, the
</p>
<p>inculcation of heretical and immoral doctrines.
</p>
<p>3rdly. As it charges the Maharajs as a body with immoral practices under the
</p>
<p>pretence of Religion.
</p>
<p>4thly. So far as it charges the plaintiff individually with the practice of immora-
</p>
<p>lity with the females of his sect.  
</p>
<p>The plaintiff complains that these several charges are false and malicious and that
</p>
<p>they have been published of, and injuriously affect him, in his individual character as
</p>
<p>a member of society at large, in his religious character and conduct as a Brahamin, as a
</p>
<p>Maharaj, as a Hindoo high Priest and as a member of the sect of Vallabhacharya.
</p>
<p>He claims damages for the injury done to him in these several characters which
</p>
<p>he claims to fill.
</p>
<p>The defendants have pleaded several pleas.
</p>
<p>Firstly.  Not guilty.
</p>
<p>Secondly.  That the Maharajs were not preceptors of the Hindoo Religion.
</p>
<p>Thirdly.  That they are not the heads or chiefs of the Bramins.
</p>
<p>Fourthly. Th2A the Plaintiff was not a Hindu Priest of high Caste or a preceptor
</p>
<p>of the Hindoo Rehgion.
</p>
<p>Fifthly.  That the sect of Vallabhacharya is not an ancient sect and that it holds
</p>
<p>doctrines repugnant to the doctrines and practices of the ancient Hindu Rehgion.
</p>
<p>Sixthly. 1\iB.\, the translation of the latter portion of the Ubel as rendered in the
</p>
<p>plaint, was not correct.
</p>
<p>Seventhly.  That the charges made by the defendants in the publication were

</p>
<p>all true.
</p>
<p>Eighthly. '^Hhs) same plea in a general form.
</p>
<p>195
</p>
<p>The Plaintiff joined issue on the first six pleas and replied " De injuria," to the*
</p>
<p>seventh and eighth.
</p>
<p>The seventh plea was of very great length, it set out various points of doctrine
</p>
<p>from books alleged to be of religious authority in the sect of Vallabhacharya and relied
</p>
<p>upon those passages as justifying the publication in charging heresy and immorality of
</p>
<p>doctrine against the INIaharajs and the sect. It also put in issue various facts and
</p>
<p>circumstances as proof of the evil reputation of the Alaharajs as a body for immorality,
</p>
<p>and it finally charged specific acts of personal immorality to have been committed by
</p>
<p>the plaintiff.
</p>
<p>The Court has been thus compelled to receive evidence at great length upon
</p>
<p>controverted points of doctrine amongst the members of that sect, and to receive it in
</p>
<p>great part through the unsatisfactory medium of translations of isolated passages from
</p>
<p>wrorks in Sanscrit or Brij-Basha, which are practically dead languages and not provided
</p>
<p>for in the translator's department.
</p>
<p>For the plaintiff there were examined thirty-one witnesses and for the defendants
</p>
<p>thirty-three. The case was contested with all the obstinacy and acrimony which gener-
</p>
<p>ally characterise caste and religious disputes, when they unfortunately force themselves
</p>
<p>into a Court of law. The trial was thus prolonged to a most unusual length.
</p>
<p>Publication by the defendants has been admitted. Upon the evidence, I entertain
</p>
<p>no doubt that the alleged libel has been correctly translated into English as it appears
</p>
<p>upon the plaint and think as so translated that the latter portion contains matter highly
</p>
<p>defamatory of the plaintiff. It substantially singles him out by name and thus directly
</p>
<p>charges him with leading a licentious and immoral life, and with defiling the wives
</p>
<p>and daughters of his devotees. It then calls upon the Plaintiff to desist from those
</p>
<p>practices and ends by assuring him that unless he does so, he cannot give religious
</p>
<p>admonition or propagate his own religion. The applicability of that portion of the pub-
</p>
<p>lication to the plaintiff has been controverted to some extent.
</p>
<p>A very intelligent witness, Dr. Bhawoo Da;ee, stated after some consideration that
</p>
<p>he understood the latter part as a " general expostulation" with the Maharajs as a
</p>
<p>class and " that any intelligent reader would so understand it" and afterwards that " he
</p>
<p>did not think it alluded to the Plaintiff." However he qualified that evidence in the
</p>
<p>end by stating to the Court " that he could not say that the plaintiff was excluded,"
</p>
<p>that with his knowledge of the plaintiffs antecedents " he did include him amongst those
</p>
<p>who were charged with defiling the wives and daughters of devotees," and his last

</p>
<p>answer was " that as a reader not knowing the plaintiff's antecedents he would consider
</p>
<p>it donhtful whether he was included or not." Now, if a writer expresses himself either
</p>
<p>through design or negligence in such a manner as to render it doubtful in the minds
</p>
<p>of one class of readers whether the defamatory matter applies to a person named ; but
</p>
<p>leave no doubt whatever on the minds of others, that it does so apply, the writer must
</p>
<p>abide by the consequences, and if otherwise liable he must answer in damages for the
</p>
<p>injury he has done to the person so defamed. Libels are to be construed according
</p>
<p>to the plain and ordinary sense of the language in which they are written, and the
</p>
<p>suggestion of a possible construction by which the party complaining might not be in-
</p>
<p>cluded is not to relieve the libeller from responsibility.
</p>
<p>196
</p>
<p>The defence made at the bar, that the Ubellous matter was not intended to apply
</p>
<p>to the plaintiff individually is scarcely consistent with the reply which the defendants
</p>
<p>made to the complaint by the plaintiff in April 18G1, when the latter called for a
</p>
<p>contradiction of and apology for, the statements " so far as they relate to the alleged
</p>
<p>improper conduct ascribed to himself the reply of the defendants was through the
</p>
<p>columns of their newspaper that they saw nothing to require " explanation, alteration,
</p>
<p>or apology."
</p>
<p>' Then holding the publication to be libellous and consequently malicious, I have
</p>
<p>next to consider the defence relied upon under the plea of not guilty, viz., That the
</p>
<p>defamatory matter was published under circumstances which formed a justifying
</p>
<p>occasion.
</p>
<p>" A Justifying occasion" has been defined in very clear terms by Baron Parke
</p>
<p>in Toogood v. Sparing I, Compton, Meeson, and Eoscoe. He states to be " the publica-
</p>
<p>tion of defamatory matter, honestly made by a person in the discharge of some public
</p>
<p>or private dutg, whether legal or moral, or in the conduct of his own affairs in
</p>
<p>matters where his interest is concerned. In such cases the occasion prevents the infer-
</p>
<p>ence of malice" and he goes on to say " that if fairly warranted by any reasonable
</p>
<p>occasion or exigency, and honestly made, such communications are protected for the
</p>
<p>common convenience and welfare of society, and the law has not restricted the right
</p>
<p>to make them within any narrow limits."
</p>
<p>The effect of the existence of a " justifying occasion" is to negative malice both in
</p>
<p>fact as well as in law, either of which is necessary to maintain an action of libel.
</p>
<p>The difference between malice'' in fact and malice in law is laid down in Bromage
</p>
<p>V. Prosser, where the former is defined to be " ill will against a person," and mahce
</p>
<p>in law " a wrongful act done, intentionally, without legal justification or excuse." And
</p>
<p>in Duncan vs. Thwaites 3 Barnwell and Cresswell, Chief Justice Abbot further defines,
</p>
<p>the meaning of the word " malice" when he says the use of the word "* malicious"
</p>
<p>in declaration of libel is " rather to exclude a supposition that the publication had
</p>
<p>been made in some innocent occasion, than for any other purpose."
</p>
<p>In cases of this kind when tried before a Jury it is their province to find,
</p>
<p>whether the communication was made bona fide or not and if in the affirmative, it
</p>
<p>becomes the duty of the judge, as a matter of law, to decide whether the occasion
</p>
<p>of the publication was such as to rebut the inference of malice or in accordance with
</p>
<p>the definition in Bromage v. Prosser whether there was any " legal justification or

</p>
<p>excuse' for the wrongful act." *
</p>
<p>I have thus to investigate and decide first, whether the publication was made
</p>
<p>bond fide by the defendants, and next, if it were, whether then a legal justification or
</p>
<p>excuse, is to be found in the surrounding circumstances proved in this case for the
</p>
<p>libel upon private character which the publication contains. In the present case I see
</p>
<p>no reason to doubt that the defendant entered into this controversy with the honest
</p>
<p>purpose of exposing to public reprobation doctrines which he conscientiously believed to
</p>
<p>be subversive of social morality, and so far as he has commented upon those doctrines,
</p>
<p>I see no ground for complaint. I consider his strictures not to have in any degree
</p>
<p>exceeded the " licentious comment" as it has been termed which is allowable upon
</p>
<p>matters more immediately affecting public interests, and I have no doubt that matters
</p>
<p>197
</p>
<p>affecting the morality of a considerable portion of the public are undoubtedly matters of
</p>
<p>that description. But the question remains whether under all the circumstances the
</p>
<p>defendants were justified in leaving the region for commentary altogether and in mak-
</p>
<p>ing a direct charge upon the plaintiffs private character, by accusing him of having
</p>
<p>been engaged in the practice of defiling the wives and daughters of his devotees under
</p>
<p>the pretence of religion. I thought the law on this subject was very clear, but in de-
</p>
<p>ference to some difficulty, which my brother Arnould feels I shall examine it at
</p>
<p>greater length than I would otherwise have considered necessary.
</p>
<p>Now, so far as the plaintiff is concerned, the case stands thus. The plaintiff was
</p>
<p>practically a stranger to Bombay prior to July 1860, when he arrived. At first he
</p>
<p>united in some reformatory views of the defendants or others with reference to female
</p>
<p>education and re-marriage of widows, but was supposed to have in part seceded from
</p>
<p>them after. He set on foot a pamphlet or periodical called " the Propagator of our
</p>
<p>own Eehgion" and invited extraneous or it may be hostile criticism, and discussion
</p>
<p>upon the views it placed before the public. On the 21st October 1860 the libel ap-
</p>
<p>pears and the plaintiff is charged in it with conduct which if true, ought to
</p>
<p>deprive him of the respect and indeed communion with the members of any civilized
</p>
<p>community.
</p>
<p>The defendant, Karsandass Mooljee, was not personally acquainted with the plaintiff,
</p>
<p>nor was he,according to his own admission, personally acquainted, with any act of immor-
</p>
<p>ality committed by the plaintiff or any other Maharaj, but prior to the libel, one Lalshunkar,
</p>
<p>an intimate friend of his, volunteered the information that the plaintiff bore a bad character
</p>
<p>for morality in Bombay, in Surat and in other places in the Mofussil, where Lalshunkar
</p>
<p>had been. Lalshunkar was a native of and an annual visitor to Surat, where the plaintiff
</p>
<p>had a temple. So far as the plaintiff was individually concerned that was all the informa-
</p>
<p>tion respecting his alleged immoral practices, that the defendants possessed at the time of
</p>
<p>the libel. It does not appear that the defendants took any pains to make inquiries into the
</p>
<p>truth of these general charges, but rested satisfied with the statements of Lalshunkar.
</p>
<p>The defendant Karsandass states that it was after the commencement of the action he began
</p>
<p>to make inquiries into the plaintiffs private life. In addition, the defendant, who was ori-
</p>
<p>ginally a member of the Vallabhacharya Sect, appears to have entertained for ten or twelve
</p>
<p>years the belief that the Maharajs as a body were guilty of adulterous practices amongst
</p>
<p>their female devotees. That belief appears to have been founded upon general rumours
</p>
<p>in the sect and upon a resolution passed by the Bhattia Caste in 1855, to put a stop

</p>
<p>to such alleged practices by preventing their females from going to the temple of the
</p>
<p>Maharajs ; and also upon reiterated charges of immoral and licentious conduct made
</p>
<p>against the Maharajs as a body, by newspapers, pamphlets and periodicals from 1855
</p>
<p>until some months prior to the publication of the libel. The defendant's conviction appears
</p>
<p>to have been also influenced by the discovery in 1860 of a commentary by Goculnathjee
</p>
<p>which appeared to the defendant to give doctrinal sanction to the immoral practices which
</p>
<p>he had previously believed to be existing amongst the body of the Maharajs. It appears,
</p>
<p>however, from Dr. Bhawoo Dajee's evidence that he has personally knovm some few
</p>
<p>Maharajs whom he described, as men of unspotted character, and of piety, and good men.
</p>
<p>Applying then the test of Baron Parke in Toogood vs. Spyring to these circumstances,
</p>
<p> were the defendants in making this defamatory charge on the private character
</p>
<p>of plaintiff through the columns of a newspaper, discharging any legal or moral public
</p>
<p>198
</p>
<p>duty or any kqal or moral private duty, or was the pulilication made in conduct of his
</p>
<p>own affairs in matters where his interest was concerned ? There was clearly no lejal
</p>
<p>duty either public or private cast upon the defendants to do so. Nor was there any moral
</p>
<p>duty, public or private, cast upon them to make that communication to the public beyond
</p>
<p>what might press upon any other individual who had heard a bad character of the plaintiff
</p>
<p>for morality and believed that report to be true. It would be a novel and a dangerous
</p>
<p>doctrine to lay down that every editor of a newspaper, or any one who had the command
</p>
<p>of its columns, should be held justified even without inquiry in making specific charges of a
</p>
<p>most defamatory character against the private life of individuals, simply because he had
</p>
<p>heard them and honestly believed them to be true, and that from their character it would be
</p>
<p>conducive to public morality to publish them. Were such a doctrine to prevail, it should be
</p>
<p>maintained independently of the actual truth of the charges, and property in private charac-
</p>
<p>ter which the law protects so jealously, might be ruthlessly swept away without redress.
</p>
<p>In my opinion there is but one plea which can serve as a defence to a libel published as the
</p>
<p>present has been, viz : That the charges contained in the libel are true. This principle is
</p>
<p>supported by the view takenby Chamber J. in Rogers vs. Clifton 3 Bosanquet and Puller
</p>
<p>587, and is cited with approbation by Mr. Justice Cresswell in Coxhead vs. Richards 2 C.
</p>
<p>B. and I think it is further sustained by the decision and dicta of the Judges in Paris vs.
</p>
<p>Levi 9 Weekly Keporter, which was cited to show that the doctrine of " justifiable occasion"
</p>
<p>has been extended to publications in newspapers as well as to those which come under
</p>
<p>the ordinary term of " confidential or privileged communications." But that case upon
</p>
<p>examination will be found to range itself under the class of cases which from Tabart v.
</p>
<p>Tipper 1 Campbell, down to the present time, have upheld the right of public comment and
</p>
<p>criticism, upon documents submitted to the public consideration. The plaintiff in Paris v. Levi
</p>
<p>published an advertisement calling the attention of servants to the fact that he was offering
</p>
<p>unprecedentedly high prices for articles that servants were in the habit of selling out of their
</p>
<p>master's establishment, this advertisement was commented upon by a heading of " Liducement
</p>
<p>to servants torob their masters." There was no charge against the plaintiff of robbing anyone
</p>
<p>but simply that the tendency of his advertisement to the public was to lead dishonest servants
</p>
<p>to pilfer for the purpose of taking advantage of these unusually high prices. If made bona
</p>
<p>fide, the comment does not appear to exceed what might reasonably be allowed, and it was
</p>
<p>so held at the trial. It afterwards came before the full Court principally on the ground of
</p>
<p>misdirection. With the direction of Chief Justice Erie, as reported in that case, I fully concur.
</p>
<p>Treating the case as one of comment: he said that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover unless
</p>

</p>
<p>he established that the defendant was actuated by malice ; that the law however did not
</p>
<p>require that the plaintiff should shew personal malice or ill will in the sense of private hatred ;
</p>
<p>but that the defamatory publication was published without any of those causes which the law
</p>
<p>considers will justify them. " Such causes excuse the publication because they shew the
</p>
<p>party was not actuated by any corrupt or malicious motives in saying that which tends to
</p>
<p>defame the character of another." But in criticism on matters which have been pub-
</p>
<p>lished by the complaining party. Lord EUenborough laid down in a case where a journal
</p>
<p>had criticised books which had been published dangerous to morality ; " that liberty of
</p>
<p>critcism must be allowed, or we, should neither have purity of taste or of morality ; that
</p>
<p>publication, I shall never consider as a libel, which has for its object, not to injure the
</p>
<p>reputation of any one, but to correct misrepresentation of fact, or to censure what is
</p>
<p>hostile to morality." " That if the jury found their verdict for the defendant, it must
</p>
<p>be on the principle so laid down. That had the defendant said one word against the
</p>
<p>199
</p>
<p>plaintiff with reference to the plaintiff's private character, he would have felt himself bound
</p>
<p>to say, ' there was no excuse of the publication.' "
</p>
<p>So Byles J. says : the real question was, " does the comment go beyond what is sanction-
</p>
<p>ed by law, was there a reflection on the plaintiff's private character." And Keating
</p>
<p>J. states :  " Now it is conceded that whilst a newspaper is justified, nay it is rather
</p>
<p>incumbent on them to comment freely on any publication. I see no distinction between
</p>
<p>this handbill and any other publication for comment. Yet that is not to degenerate
</p>
<p>into imputations of a personal character. What was said at the trial was " That
</p>
<p>though a fair comment could be privileged, yet if of a personal character it would not."
</p>
<p>The direction was perfectly right. In Carr v. Hood, 1 Campbell, Lord Ellenborough said :
</p>
<p>" Shew 7ne an attack on the moral character of the plaintiff, or any attack upon his character
</p>
<p>unco7inected with his authorship, and I shall be as ready as any Judge that ever sat here
</p>
<p>to protect him.; but I cannot hear of malice on account of turning writers into ridicule."
</p>
<p>Thus from Tabart v. Tipper and Carr v. Hood, from 1808 down to 1860 when Paris v. Levi
</p>
<p>was decided, defamation of private character in public journals, has been treated as ordinarily
</p>
<p>beyond the pale of " justifying occasion ;" and I see nothing in the present case to take
</p>
<p>it out of that principle. The selection of a public newspaper as the medium for matter
</p>
<p>defamatory of private character is one of the strongest proofs of such malice and will
</p>
<p>withdraw the protection of a "justifying occasion."
</p>
<p>It was also contended that the defendant Kursandass Mooljee was justified in pub-
</p>
<p>lishing the libel by reason of the private interest which he had as a member of the
</p>
<p>sect of Vallabhacharya in protecting it from the corruption of such immorality as was
</p>
<p>charged against the plaintiff, but I much doubt on the defendant's evidence whether he
</p>
<p>can be considered to be a member of that sect, whatever force there might be in such
</p>
<p>an argument, is taken away by the mode of publication having quite exceeded the
</p>
<p>bounds suited to the occasion. Had he taken means to have convened a meeting of the
</p>
<p>sect and so published to the members interested the defamatory matter concerning one
</p>
<p>of their spiritual heads with a view to investigation, perhaps he might have had some
</p>
<p>colour for the defence, but the defendant selected a public newspaper, and without any
</p>
<p>previous enquiry published the defamatory matter, not to the parties interested only, but
</p>
<p>to the whole world. For the above reasons I think the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict
</p>
<p>upon the plea of the general issue.
</p>
<p>I now proceed to consider the plea of justification. In commenting upon the evi-
</p>
<p>dence I will avoid as far as practicable any reiteration of its disgusting details and deal

</p>
<p>with the credibiUty of the witnesses on general principles and in general terms. We
</p>
<p>are not now called upon to express any opinion as to whether the plea of justification
</p>
<p>covers the charge in the libel. That plea if proved, is on the record admitted to
</p>
<p>contain a sufficient answer, and it is with it alone we have now to deal.
</p>
<p>The text upon which this libel was founded is a commentary by Goculnathjee Ma-
</p>
<p>haraj, upon a work composed by his grandfather Vallabhacharya, the founder of this sect.
</p>
<p>In the Sanscrit original, the name of the person to whom an offering of wives and
</p>
<p>daughters, &c. is to be made is not mentioned, and upon the evidence there can be no
</p>
<p>reasonable doubt that the offering was to be made to " Purshotum" which is a name
</p>
<p>for the Supreme Being. The compiler of a small work in Guzeratee entitled " Bio-
</p>
<p>graphical sketches of ancient Hindu Authors" (and in wliich he gives an account of
</p>
<p>200
</p>
<p>the various religious sects in India) acting upon his own knowledge of the Sanskrit
</p>
<p>language and upon his own construction of this passage, introduced the word " Acharya"
</p>
<p>to represent the name ot the person to whom this offering was to be made. That
</p>
<p>word appears to be one of very general and undefined application in various Hindu
</p>
<p>sects, but in the Vallabacharya sect it is synonymous with Guru or Spiritual Guide,
</p>
<p>and is one of the hundred and more names applied to the Maharajs. The term " Pur-
</p>
<p>shotum," i. e. Supreme Being or Lord, is also one of the names by which they are
</p>
<p>addressed. The defendant took his text as it appeared in a Marathi translation of the
</p>
<p>Goozeratee work, changing " Acharya" into " Maharaj." He had no means of con-
</p>
<p>sulting the original as he was not acquainted with Sanskrit, and there is no apparent
</p>
<p>reason to doubt that he relied on the accuracy of the compiler in introducing the word
</p>
<p>" Acharya" into the text. It is not necessary to enquire and it would perhaps be
</p>
<p>hazardous to offer an opinion, upon what the intention of Goculnathjee was, in making
</p>
<p>use of those words, but it appears abundantly from works of recognised authority,
</p>
<p>written by other Maharajs and from existing popular belief in the Vallabhacharya sect
</p>
<p>that Vallabhacharya is believed to have been an mcarnation of the God Krishna, and
</p>
<p>that, the Maharajs as descendents of Vallabacharya have claimed and received from their
</p>
<p>followers the like character of incarnation of that God, by hereditary succession. The
</p>
<p>Maharajs have been sedulous in identifying themselves with the God Krishna by means
</p>
<p>of their own writings and teachings and by the similarity of ceremonies of worship and
</p>
<p>addresses which they require to be offered to themselves by their followers. All songs
</p>
<p>connected with the God Krishna, which were brought before us were of an amorous
</p>
<p>character, and it appeared that songs of a corrupting and licentious tendency, both in
</p>
<p>idea and expression, are sung by young females to the Maharajs, upon festive occasions,
</p>
<p>in which they are identified with the God in his most licentious aspect. In these
</p>
<p>songs, as well as in stories, both written and traditional, which latter are treated as
</p>
<p>of a religions character in the sect, the subject of sexual intercourse is most prominent.
</p>
<p>Adultery is made familiar to the minds of all ; it is no where discouraged or denounced,
</p>
<p>but on the contrary, in some of the stories, those persons who have committed that
</p>
<p>great moral and social offence are commended, and in one ot them, the actors are
</p>
<p>awarded the highest position in the heaven of the Vaishnavas, although nominally, for
</p>
<p>some attention paid on one occasion to the clearing of a temple of the God. The love
</p>
<p>and subserviancy inculcated by the Hindu religion to be due in a spiritual sense to the
</p>
<p>Supreme Being has been by those corrupt teachings materialised, and to a large extent,

</p>
<p>transferred to those who claim to be his living incarnations. It is said to be cere-
</p>
<p>monially effected by a mystic rite or dedication of " mind" " property" and " body"
</p>
<p>(or mun, dhun, and tun) which is made in childhood by males, but by females at
</p>
<p>the ceremony of marriage, and a popular belief appears to exist to a considerable ex-
</p>
<p>tent that this dedication confers upon the Maharajs absolute rights over the " minds,"
</p>
<p>" properties," and " bodies" of their followers. The Maharajs, however, appear upon
</p>
<p>the evidence to have undoubtedly availed themselves of the existence of those impressions
</p>
<p>to gratify licentious propensities and a love of gain. These doctrines and practices are
</p>
<p>opposed to what we know of the original principles of the ancient Hindu religion which
</p>
<p>are said to be found in the Veds. They recognise no incarnations, but the well knewn
</p>
<p>avatar and the Hindu code of law and morals equally inculcute chastity in females
</p>
<p>before marriage, and fidelity m the married state. Therefore, so far as we may be
</p>
<p>called upon to express an opinion upon this part of the plea, the defendant has sue-
</p>
<p>201
</p>
<p>cessfully shewn, that the doctrines of the Vallabhacharya sect are in those respects
</p>
<p>contrary to those of the ancient Hindu rehgion. He has proved that the Maharajaha
</p>
<p>claimed to be and are considered and worshipped by a considerable portion of the sect
</p>
<p>as Gods or incarnations of God ; and he has, we think, established that, this supersti-
</p>
<p>tion has led to a lamentable want of moral feeling in the Vallabhacharyan sect, and to
</p>
<p>the practice of gross immoralities. It is to the credit of the plaintiff, that in his evidence
</p>
<p>he has disavowed for himself any claim to be considered as an incarnation of God.
</p>
<p>He stated that he had so informed his followers, but was unable to remember when,
</p>
<p>or to whom he addressed such advice. There was no other evidence offered of his
</p>
<p>having done so, but it appeared to establish the generality or strength of such a belief
</p>
<p>amongst the followers of the Maharajahs, when it became necessary for him to thus
</p>
<p>disavow that character. The next branch of this plea of justification is that in which
</p>
<p>it is alleged, that the immoral or licentious practices of the Maharajahs as stated in
</p>
<p>the libel, were matters of notoriety in the Vallabhacharya sect as well as outside of it,
</p>
<p>that they had been denounced by their own followers, and by others in pamphlets,
</p>
<p>newspapers, and hand-bills published in all languages in Bombay. Several credible wit-
</p>
<p>nesses of the Vallabhacharya sect were examined, who deposed to the existence of that
</p>
<p>opinion in the sect, and in addition as evidence of the strength of that feeling, the
</p>
<p>defendants put in issue a resolution passed at a meeting of the Bhattia caste in 1855
</p>
<p>for the purpose of preventing the females going to worship at the temples, except at
</p>
<p>period when the Maharajahs were personally occupied in the performance of the wor-
</p>
<p>ship of their God. That resolution was proved to have been come to, in consequence
</p>
<p>of its being believed that immoral practices were taking place between the Maharajah
</p>
<p>and their female Bhattia devotees, under color of the latter going at night to perform
</p>
<p>worship at the Vallabhacharya temples. Since that period, newspapers, pamphlets, and
</p>
<p>handbills in various languages in Bombay have very frequently denounced the preten-
</p>
<p>sions of tire Maharajahs to divinity, have charged them with the grossest immorality,
</p>
<p>have held them up as objects for public reprobation, and latterly in 1859 have made
</p>
<p>use of the strongest and sometimes the coarsest terms, in describing their alleged profligacy
</p>
<p>of conduct and licentious vice. It also appeared in evidence that some Maharajahs had
</p>
<p>committed acts of immorality and licentiousness to the knowledge of witnesses who
</p>
<p>deposed to them, and whose testimony I do not see any reason to doubt. The plaintiff
</p>
<p>and Jeevunjee Maharaj in Bombay were stated in the plea to have admitted in the
</p>
<p>presence of some of the members of the sect the prevalence of the crime of adultery

</p>
<p>amongst their body, and also to have said, that great difficulty would be experienced in
</p>
<p>checking it, as the Maharajahs derived the greater portion of their incomes from female
</p>
<p>devotees, and that no other sufficient means were provided for their support. Jeevunjee
</p>
<p>Maharaj was not produced to contradict or explain these statements, although his name
</p>
<p>is mentioned in the plea in connection with that fact, and the plea had been filed for
</p>
<p>nine months before the trial. The plaintiff denied the admission, but we feel no difficulty
</p>
<p>in discrediting that denial, and in believing that the conversation took place. The
</p>
<p>credibility of the witnesses who deposed to it was not impeached, and the character, of
</p>
<p>some of them was such, that we do not feel at liberty to doubt their truth. We have
</p>
<p>therefore no hesitation in arriving at the conclusion that this portion, also, of the plea
</p>
<p>has been satisfactorily proved.
</p>
<p>We now approach the last division of this plea, which so vitally affects the
</p>
<p>character of the plaintiff, not only for immorality of conduct, but for truth on his
</p>
<p>26
</p>
<p>202
</p>
<p>oath in a court of justice. Any one who was present at his examination, and
</p>
<p>the lengthened cross-examination which he underwent for the greater part of three
</p>
<p>days, must feel that, he is a man of great intelligence, and of considerable native
</p>
<p>attainments. Any contradiction to the testimony of other witnesses cannot have arisen
</p>
<p>from confusion or mistake ; it must have been wilful and deliberate. He has contradicted
</p>
<p>in the most direct terms every charge of personal immorality made against himself,
</p>
<p>every conversation approaching to an admission of immoral practices upon his own part
</p>
<p>or of licentious conduct of other Maharajahs. In a conflict of evidence where there must
</p>
<p>be a wilful false swearing at one side or the other, it is desirable to select some one
</p>
<p>material fact upon which there is a clear and direct collision, and through it, to test
</p>
<p>the credibility of the witnesses at one side or the other. The plea charged as evidence
</p>
<p>of the licentious character of the plaintiff, that in the year 1860, he was suffering
</p>
<p>from a malady contracted from immoral intercourse with females. The defendants pro-
</p>
<p>duced two medical men who were consulted by the plaintiff. Doctors Bhawoo Dajee and
</p>
<p>Dhirajram Dulputram. Both are Graduates of the Grant Medical College, and the first at
</p>
<p>least long distinguished for his scientific, literary and medical attainments. It is but
</p>
<p>justice to those gentlemen to say, that they only gave medical evidence, upon the legal
</p>
<p>compulsion, which it was the duty of the Court to apply. Dr. Dajee states that the
</p>
<p>plaintiff sent for him professionally, and in giving a description of his ailment, made
</p>
<p>use of a term of familiar and unmistakeable medical meaning, which coupled with the
</p>
<p>history of its origin, left no doubt in Dr. Dajee's mind of the character of the disease.
</p>
<p>The plaintiff having then declined to submit to an ocular examination, informed Dr.
</p>
<p>Dajee that he would the next morning send Goverdundass to give more accurate details.
</p>
<p>Goverdundass was the confidential agent and manager for the plaintiff, and he next
</p>
<p>morning gave a description and history fuller but in substance and terms identical with
</p>
<p>that already given by the plaintiff. This agent and manager was in Bombay during
</p>
<p>the trial, and although several days elapsed between the evidence of Dr. Dajee and the
</p>
<p>close of the plaintiff's rebutting case, Goverdhundass was not called to contradict or explain
</p>
<p>that evidence. Dr. Dulputram who had been one of the Vallabhacharyan sect was
</p>
<p>consulted professionally by the plaintiff in about three months afterwards, and was in
</p>
<p>attendance upon him for more than a month. He treated the plaintiff for a similar
</p>
<p>disease, which was described by the latter as having been contracted by him from
</p>
<p>immoral intercourse with a female about the period when Dr. Dajee had been sent for.
</p>
<p>The plaintiff was cured by the treatment of Dr. Dulputram after salivation, and upon

<p>Bombay, was at that time in the habit of daily intercourse with the plaintiff, and had
</p>
<p>been requested by the latter to bring Dr. Dajee (who is a Brahamin) to visit him pro-
</p>
<p>fessionally. He fully corroborates these two medical witnesses. Through the medium
</p>
<p>of conversations with the plaintiff, the latter described his malady by name, and the
</p>
<p>mode in which it was contracted, together with other details which it is not necessary
</p>
<p>to mention. It was further elicited in cross-examination that the plaintiff had undergone
</p>
<p>a medical examination on the preceding evening by three Doctors, with a view of
</p>
<p>sustaining his own denial of the existence of the disease and of the truth of the state-
</p>
<p>ments made by Drs. Dajee and Dulputram and by Lukmidass Khimjee. None of
</p>
<p>203
</p>
<p>these Doctors were produced for the plaintiff to give an account of that recent examination.
</p>
<p>Upon this conflict of evidence between the plaintiff alone, and the three witnesses Dr.
</p>
<p>Dajee, Dulputram, and Lukmeedass, coupled with the non-produciion of Goverdhundass,
</p>
<p>or any of the three medical men who made the last examination, I feel myself com-
</p>
<p>pelled to come to the conclusion, that the plaintiff has allowed his personal interests to
</p>
<p>overcome his respect for truth, while on his oath in this Court. And having reluctantly
</p>
<p>but confidently arrived at the conviction that he has in this instance wilfully foreswore
</p>
<p>himself, I can place no trust or reliance upon any denials he has given to the personal
</p>
<p>acts of immorality with which he has been charged. The character of the principal
</p>
<p>witnesses for the defendants have not been impeached. Many of them are members
</p>
<p>of the Yallabhacharyan sect, and still frequent the temples of the ]\Iaharajs. It has not
</p>
<p>been suggested that they entertain any personal hostility to the plainiiff. They have
</p>
<p>apparently no personal interest to serve, but much caste or sect obloquy to undergo for
</p>
<p>the part they have taken, and the evidence they have given against a Maharaj. The
</p>
<p>account of Lukmidass Khimjee in support of the charge of the plaintiffs immorality
</p>
<p>at Beyt is a strange and almost incredible story, but I cannot believe it to have been
</p>
<p>invented for this trial. In answer to the Court, he stated the names of four persons,
</p>
<p>members of the sect, in whose presence several years before he had detailed the
</p>
<p>circumstances he narrated in the witness-box. None of those persons were produced to
</p>
<p>contradict him, and when all of those who were in Bombay, were produced by the
</p>
<p>defendants for cross-examination, the plaintiff shrunk from impeaching, through their
</p>
<p>testimony, the truth of the statement of Lukmidass Khimjee. The plaintiff produced
</p>
<p>evidence to his good character for morality at Surat, Beyt, and several other places in
</p>
<p>which it had been impeached. He also sought to establish the falsehood of the testimony
</p>
<p>of Lukmidass Khimjee respecting the act of immorality at Beyt, by calling witnesses
</p>
<p>to shew that by night and by day, plaintiff had personal attendants waiting upon him,
</p>
<p>who never left him alone for an instant, and which rendered it improbable in the
</p>
<p>highest degree that he could have been guilty of the immoral act deposed to. That
</p>
<p>evidence is in itself contrary to all probability and is contradicted incidentally by the
</p>
<p>statement of Dr. Dulputram, who in his professional treatment always saw the plaintiff
</p>
<p>alone. On examination of those witnesses, it appeared that the greater number were
</p>
<p>followers of the sect of the Maharajs. Some of them avowed that they believed the
</p>
<p>Maharajs to be incarnations of the Deity. Others, that they would not believe anything
</p>
<p>against the character of a Maharaj, that a Maharaj could not do anything wrong, that

<p>he could not be a bad man, and that it was a sin to give evidence against a
</p>
<p>Maharaj in a court of justice, and that any one who did, should not be spoken to
</p>
<p>and should be outcasted.
</p>
<p>Bearing in mind the efforts that were proved to have been made to prevent evidence
</p>
<p>being given by his co-sectaries against the plaintiff in this case, and looking upon the
</p>
<p>description of that given for him, we cannot allow the negative character of the latter to
</p>
<p>outweigh the clear, strong, and direct evidence given for the defendant, under those difficulties.
</p>
<p>We think that the essential points in the libel, as the record stands, have been
</p>
<p>sufficiently covered by the proof adduced in support of the plea of justification, and that
</p>
<p>there must be a verdict for the defendant upon that issue.
</p>
<p>As to the minor pleas, a verdict for the plaintiff will be entered on the 2nd, 4th,
</p>
<p>and 6th ; and for the defendants on the 3rd and 5th pleas, in addition to the 7th atid 8th.
</p>
<p>204
</p>
<p>After having found a verdict for the defendants upon the issues raised by the Plea
</p>
<p>of Justication, the plaintiff can only recover a verdict for nominal damages on the plea
</p>
<p>of Not Guilty. As we have felt obliged to disbelieve the plaintiff on his oath and also
</p>
<p>the greater number of the witnesses produced to corroborate him, our verdict will be
</p>
<p>ntered without costs.
</p>
<p>The defendant to be entitled to the costs of the issues found in his favour.
</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Arnould, in giving judgment, said : 
</p>
<p>In this case I shall make no apology for stating at some length, the reasons for my
</p>
<p>judgment. In a matter of such general interest and importance the public have a right
</p>
<p>to be satisfied that the minds of both members of the Court have been actively engaged
</p>
<p>in sifting the evidence and arriving at a pains-taking and conscientious decision. I have,
</p>
<p>besides, on one point not been able to come .to the same conclusion as the Chief
</p>
<p>Justice ; and though that point does not materially affect the vital question in the case,
</p>
<p>and relates not so much to the law itself as to the application of the law, it is yet
</p>
<p>too important to be passed over in silence.
</p>
<p>1, On the first issue the question that arises is this : Is the article complained of
</p>
<p>a libel ; or is it so far justified by the occasion, i. e. by the whole of the circumstances
</p>
<p>preceding and accompanying its publication, as to be, though defamatory, not libellous.
</p>
<p>The doctrine of justifying occasion as deduced from the authorities is this : The
</p>
<p>essence of libel is malice. Prima facie every publication containing matter tending to
</p>
<p>defame or criminate another is held to be libellous ;  that is  malice, the essence of
</p>
<p>libel, is legally inferred from the mere fact of publishing of another that which tends to
</p>
<p>criminate or defame him. But this prima facie inference may be repelled : it may be
</p>
<p>shown that the circumstances under which the publication took place were such as to
</p>
<p>preclude the legal inference of malice arising from the mere fact of publication and to
</p>
<p>constitute a justififing occasion for publishing that which tends to defame and criminate
</p>
<p>another.
</p>
<p>If such a justifying occasion be made out, the only enquiry remaining, in order to
</p>
<p>ascertain whether a given publication be or be not libellous, is the enquiry whether the
</p>
<p>publication, on the face of it, shows what is legally called express malice ; in other
</p>
<p>words, whether the virulence and bitterness of the language employed by the writer so
</p>
<p>far exceeds what the occasion warrants as to show that he was actuated by personal
</p>
<p>rancour, by a malignant and vindictive desire to criminate and defame. Unless this
</p>
<p>appears the publication though defamatory or criminatory is not libellous (see the whole

<p>current of authorities from Rex. vs. Baillie, 21 Howell's State Trials 10 (in A. D. ,
</p>
<p>1778) down to Harrison vs. Bush 5 Ell and Blackb. and IG L. J. Q. B. 25 (A. D.
</p>
<p>1855.)
</p>
<p>As to what will constitute a justifying occasion the points principally to be attended
</p>
<p>to are these : First. The publication must be bona fide, i. e., at the time of publication
</p>
<p>the writer must honestly and upon fair reasonable grounds believe that which he publishes
</p>
<p>to be substantially true. Secondly/, the publication must be with regard to a subject
</p>
<p>matter in which the party publishing has an interest, or in reference to which he has
</p>
<p>a duty. Thirdly, those to whom the publication is addressed must have an interest
</p>
<p>and a duty in some degree corresponding to his own.
</p>
<p>205
</p>
<p>The word duty here employed (as the late Chief Justice of England declared the
</p>
<p>law in Harrison vs. Bush) is " not to be confined to legal duties which may be
</p>
<p>enforced by indictment, action or mandamus, hut must include moral and social duties
</p>
<p>cf imperfect obligation:'' (See the well-considered judgment of the Court of Queens Bench
</p>
<p>^is delivered by Lord Campbell in the case of Harrison vs. Bush. 16 L. J. Q. B. p. 29.)
</p>
<p>As to the extent of the privilege or the j'usif cation  that varies necessarily with
</p>
<p>the nature of the subject matter of the alleged libel ; if it be a matter like the
</p>
<p>character of a servant, &c.  in regard to which only one person or only a few persons
</p>
<p>have an interest or duty corresponding to that of the writer, then he is only privileged
</p>
<p>or justified in communicating to that one or to those few ; if, on the other hand, it
</p>
<p>be a matter in regard to which the general public has an interest and a duty  if it
</p>
<p>be a great social scandal and a great public wrong  if it be a matter in the exposure
</p>
<p>of which all society has an interest and in the endeavour to discharge and put down
</p>
<p>which all society has a duty  finally, if it be a matter beyond the cognizance of any-
</p>
<p>other tribunal except the condemnatory judgment of public opinion  in such cases, the
</p>
<p>writer, if writing bon<i fide, is privileged or justified in making the communication as
</p>
<p>public as he can.
</p>
<p>Such in my judgment are the principles of law applicable to the present case. In
</p>
<p>applying them I propose to consider the following questions :  "What was the defendant's
</p>
<p>professional and social position at the time the alleged Hbel was published ? What was
</p>
<p>his consequent interest and social duty in reference to the subject matter of the alleged
</p>
<p>libel ? What was his then state of knowledge and belief in respect to such subject matter ?
</p>
<p>What or whom does he attack in the alleged libel ? To whom does he address
</p>
<p>himself in publishing it ? What was the immediate occasion of publishing it ? Is the
</p>
<p>language in which the alleged libel is couched in excess of what the occasion warranted ?
</p>
<p>rirst then ; %cho or tchat was the defendant at the time of the publication of the
</p>
<p>alleged libel 1 By birth and early initiation he was a member of the Vallabhacharyan
</p>
<p>sect, but for some years before the libel was published, in consequence mainly of his
</p>
<p>disgust at the practices which in the libel he denounces, he had ceased to worship in
</p>
<p>the temples of the Maharajs. For some time before the publication of the alleged
</p>
<p>libel he had been editor of the Satya Prakash, a native newspaper published in the
</p>
<p>Guzerattee language, and principally read and circulated among the two wealthy and
</p>
<p>extensive castes of the Bhattias and the Banyans. Both these castes are devout followers
</p>
<p>of the Maharaj : of the Banyan caste the defendant was himself a member.

</p>
<p>Such was the defendant's position, what was his conseqttent interest and duty ?
</p>
<p>As a Vallabhacharyan addressing his co-sectaries, as a Banyan addressing his caste
</p>
<p>fellows  above all as a journalist addressing his readers composed principally of followers
</p>
<p>of the Maharajs, had he no interest, had he no duty in denouncing the malpractices
</p>
<p>which it is the principal object ' of this alleged libel to expose ? It appears to me that
</p>
<p>he had both an interest and a duty.
</p>
<p>A public journalist is a public teacher : the true function of the press, that by virtue
</p>
<p>of which it has rightly grown to be one of the great powers of the modern world  is
</p>
<p>the function of teaching, elevating and enlightening those who fall within the range of
</p>
<p>its influence.
</p>
<p>206
</p>
<p>To expose and denounce evil and barbarous practices ; to attack usages and customs
</p>
<p>inconsistent with moral purity and social progress, is one of its highest, its most im-
</p>
<p>perative duties. When those evils and errors are consecrated by time, fenced round by
</p>
<p>custom, countenanced and supported by the highest and most influential class in society,
</p>
<p>when they are wholly beyond the control and supervision of any other tribunal, then
</p>
<p>it is the function and the duty of the press to intervene ; honestly endeavouring by
</p>
<p>all the powers of argument, denunciation and ridicule, to change and purify the public
</p>
<p>opinion which is the real basis on which these evils are built and the real power by
</p>
<p>which they are perpetuated.
</p>
<p>As editor of the Satt/a Prakash, the defendant was, in my opinion, acting within
</p>
<p>the clear limits of his duty (as defined in the case of Harrison vs. Bush) in denouncing
</p>
<p>to a public principally composed of Bhattias and Banyans, the moral delinquencies of
</p>
<p>the Maharajs.
</p>
<p>When the defendant published his alleged libel what was his state of knowledge and
</p>
<p>belief as to the matters of which it treats ? To the defendant himself, a member of
</p>
<p>the Vallabhacharyan sect, and of the Banyan caste, the profligacy of the Maharajs had
</p>
<p>been known as matter of general reputation and universal notoriety, from his earliest years.
</p>
<p>" It is" says he " the general reputation of our sect that when girls are married
</p>
<p>they are sent to the Maharaj to be enjoyed, before they are touched by their husbands.
</p>
<p>This has been the reputation as long as I can remember, and" he adds " I have
</p>
<p>known instances."
</p>
<p>When as a youth he had attended the temples he had seen Maharajs pressing with
</p>
<p>their feet the hands of their more favoured female devotees and, though young, he
</p>
<p>knew perfectly well what this meant.
</p>
<p>He was cognizant of the fact that in 1855, those devout followers of the Maharajs,
</p>
<p>the members of the Bhattia caste, had held a caste meeting, at which a resolution was
</p>
<p>passed " to fix hours at which their females should visit the temples ; that they might
</p>
<p>not ham carnal intercourse with the Maharaj.'"
</p>
<p>With regard to the plaintiff himself the defendant was informed before the publication
</p>
<p>of the libel, on what he had every reason to consider good authority, that his conduct
</p>
<p>formed no exception to the general conduct of his class.
</p>
<p>" The general character of the Maharajs is that of debauchees ; the plaintiff has
</p>
<p>also the reputation of a debauchee :" he was told this, before the publication of the
</p>
<p>alleged libel by Nurmda Lallshunker, his intimate friend, and who, as being in common

</p>
<p>Vfith the plaintiff a native of Surat and for some time a resident there, had the
</p>
<p>amplest means of information as to the plaintiff's character.
</p>
<p>The result of all this as to his state of belief when the libel was published is
</p>
<p>thus stated in his evidence. " At the time I wrote the alleged libel, I believed the
</p>
<p>Maharajs individually and as a class, to be guilty of what I call defiling the wives and
</p>
<p>daughters of their devotees."
</p>
<p>Although thus fully informed of, and on good grounds, firmly believing in the
</p>
<p>immoralities of the Maharajs it was not until a short time (some four or five months)
</p>
<p>207
</p>
<p>before the publication of the libel, that he saw reason to believe that these imnioraUties
</p>
<p>were sanctioned by the sacred books of the Vallabhacharyans.
</p>
<p>It was about that time that he fell in with a popular compilation in the Mahratta
</p>
<p>language, professing to give an account of the tenets of various sects, including those of
</p>
<p>the Vallabhacharyans.
</p>
<p>The portions of this Mahratta work relating to the Vallabhacharyans were supplied
</p>
<p>by defendant's intimate friend, the young Nagar Brahmin, Nurmda Lallshunker, who
</p>
<p>had shown the MSS, to the defendant before it was published.
</p>
<p>In this Mahratta compilation the verse of Goculnathjee to which so much prominence
</p>
<p>is given in the allged Ubel, is introduced thus :
</p>
<p>" Besides this there are strict words of comment written in a book called the
</p>
<p>Sidhant Rasi/a [this is the book which forms the text of Goculnathjee' s commentary] to
</p>
<p>the effect that " all things should be offered and presented to the Ac/mp-ia" (i. e.
</p>
<p>the MaharaJ) " and then enjoyed." It is then added, " To offer every thing means
</p>
<p>that even our wives, sons, &c., .should not be brought into use without offering them."
</p>
<p>From this publication the defendant would naturally infer that the commentary
</p>
<p>of Goculnathjee enjoined the offering up of wives and daughters (for " daughters" are
</p>
<p>without dispute included in the expression " sons, &c.") to the Maharaj by way of carnal
</p>
<p>intercourse.
</p>
<p>The defendant did not understand Sanscrit, but he could read Brij-Basha ; he
</p>
<p>forthwith began to study several Vallabhacharyan works in Brij-Basha from these he
</p>
<p>derived the conclusion that the statement of doctrine in the Mahratta compilation was
</p>
<p>borne out by the authoritative works of the sect.
</p>
<p>As to the Sanscrit verse of Goculnathjee, he satisfied himself, he says, from enquiry
</p>
<p>among those who understood Sanscrit, that its meaning is as set forth in the hbel.
</p>
<p>That meaning is set forth thus :
</p>
<p>" Consequently before he himself has enjoyed her, he should make over his lawful
</p>
<p>wife to the 31aharaj and he should also make over his sons and daughters ; after having
</p>
<p>got marri-:'d he should before having himself enjoyed his wife, make an offering of her
</p>
<p>to the Maharaj, after which he should apply her to his own use."
</p>
<p>The friend to whom he applied for this translation would seem to have been N'urmda
</p>
<p>Lallshunker, the young Brahmin who showed him the MSS. from which this part of
</p>
<p>the Mahratta work was printed ; who represented himself as having a thorough knowledge
</p>
<p>of Sanscrit, and who strenuously maintained in the witness box, that the meaning given

</p>
<p>in the alleged libel to Goculnathjee" s commentary was correct,  that the dedication there
</p>
<p>spoken of was a dedication not to the Supreme Being for spiritual purposes, but to his
</p>
<p>personification, the Maharaj, for carnal purposes.
</p>
<p>It has been elaborately and learnedly contended that this interpretation is incorrect :
</p>
<p> that Goculnathjee never intended, nor do his words, in their literal sense, import, the
</p>
<p>meaning thus put upon them. It may or may not be so : the question as to the
</p>
<p>precise grammatical meaning of the text, or the probable intention of the writer, does
</p>
<p>20S
</p>
<p>not go to the root of the present enquiry. It is not a charge of libel on Goculnathjee
</p>
<p>that we are trying, but a charge of libel on the Plaintiff. The question is not what
</p>
<p>Goculnathjee originally wrote or intended, but what in practice, his text or other similar
</p>
<p>texts have been construed to mean and perverted to sanction. It is abundantly clear on
</p>
<p>the evidence, as it will presently be necessary to show more at large, that the INIaharaja
</p>
<p>have for a lengthened period been so far identified by their followers with Krishna 
</p>
<p>have been to such an extent regarded as Gods and worshipped as Gods, that it would
</p>
<p>be exceedingly difficult, if not absolutely impossible, to pronounce with any certainty,.
</p>
<p>how far a text apparently contemplating a dedication to God, might or might not be
</p>
<p>regarded in the Vallabhacharyan sect as authorizing a dedication to the Maharaj.
</p>
<p>This, however, is not a question we are called upon to decide. The question for us^
</p>
<p>on this part of the case, is whether the defendant when he printed this alleged libel in
</p>
<p>his paper, had or had not justifying occasion for publishing that the class to which the
</p>
<p>plaintiff belonged, and the plaintiff himself, as a member of such class, acting on the
</p>
<p>supposed sanction and authority of certain texts, whether rightly or wrongly understood,
</p>
<p>whether wrested from their true meaning or not, defiled the wives and daughters of
</p>
<p>their devotees.
</p>
<p>That the defendant when he printed his interpretation of the text in the alleged libel
</p>
<p>honestly and bona fide believed it to be the correct one is perfectly plain on the face of
</p>
<p>the evidence, and was not indeed seriously questioned by the learned counsel for the-
</p>
<p>plaintiff. Ignorant himself of Sanscrit (the language in which Goculnathjee's commentary
</p>
<p>is written) he applied for assistance to those whom he honestly believed to be competent
</p>
<p>authorities, and the interpretation with which they supplied him he made use of in
</p>
<p>sincere and undoubting reliance on its accuracy.
</p>
<p>Such having been the defendant's position, consequent duty and state of knowledge
</p>
<p>and belief at the time he published this alleged libel, the next question is, what and
</p>
<p>whom did he attack ?
</p>
<p>Primarily he attacks a flagrant social enormity and scandal. Per generations the-
</p>
<p>hereditary high priests of his sect, had as he believed, committed whoredom with the
</p>
<p>daughters of his people. Like the sons of Eli they had done this openly at the gates
</p>
<p>of the temple  like the sons of Eli they had done this under the pretended sanction,
</p>
<p>and in the abused name of religion. This is the thing he denounces. It would be a
</p>
<p>waste of words to point out that in denouncing it, vehemently, bitterly, indignantly  he
</p>
<p>was within the strict limits of his duty as a public writer. The interests of Society

</p>
<p>require that wickedness such as this, should be sternly exposed and unrelentingly hunted
</p>
<p>down. If to write vehemently  bitterly  indignantly on such a subject as this be
</p>
<p>libellous, then were the prophets of old libellers  then were the early fathers of the
</p>
<p>church libellers  then have all earnest men in all time been libellers, who have published
</p>
<p>to the world in the fit language of generous indignation, their scorn of hypocrisy and
</p>
<p>their hatred of vice.
</p>
<p>Such is the thing the defendant attacks in this libel. Who are the persons he
</p>
<p>attacks ? The class who do this wickedness and the plaintiff as a member of this class ;
</p>
<p> the Maharajs, and the plaintiff as a Maharaj. This is throughout the language of
</p>
<p>the alleged libel; "In the Kali yug (or iron age) many other heresies, and many sects
</p>
<p>have arisen, besides that of Vallabhacharya, but no other sectaries have ever perpetrated
</p>
<p>209
</p>
<p>such shamelessness, subtlity, immodesty, rascality and deceit as have the sect of ths
</p>
<p>Maharajs"  " You Maharajs, acting up to the commentary, defile the wives and daughters
</p>
<p>of your devotees."
</p>
<p>He attacks the class as perpetrators of this great wickedness, he attacks the plaintiff
</p>
<p>as one of the class. It is said that in so doing he inferentially also defames him as
</p>
<p>an individual : I admit it, but I say the occasion justified it. A case had arisen in
</p>
<p>which the possible injury to the individual was not to be weighed in the balance against
</p>
<p>the great countervailing benefit, derivable to Society from exposing and denouncing the
</p>
<p>evil deeds of tlie class : and the acts denounced were immoralities, not of the plaintiff
</p>
<p>as an individual in his private life, but of the plaintiff as a Maharaj in his public life.
</p>
<p>Then to lehom does the defendant addre.'^s hhnself in makhnj the attack ? To
</p>
<p>the public at large :  the only power, the only authority, the only tribunal to whom in
</p>
<p>such a case as this the communication could be made, or the complaint directed. The
</p>
<p>Maharajs, the hereditary high priests of the "N'allabhacharyan sect are, in respect of the
</p>
<p>practices denounced in the libel, virtually amenable to no jurisdiction, spiritual or temporal,
</p>
<p>criminal or civil. As far as the evidence before us goes, they appear to constitute a
</p>
<p>co-equal brotherhood of 65 or 70 members, owning a vague and shadowy sort of
</p>
<p>allegiance to a nominal superior at Shree Nathjee  a remote shrine among the deserts
</p>
<p>of Marvvar. This nominal superior appears to be a careless and Epicurean sort of God :
</p>
<p>no instance of his interference was adduced before us : practically each Maharaj does as
</p>
<p>seems good in his own eyes, especially as relates to the abomination which it is the
</p>
<p>peculiar object of this alleged libel to expose.
</p>
<p>From the tenor ot the evidence I thought, at one stage of the enquiry, that
</p>
<p>Jeicanjee Maharaj (a high priest who appears honourably distinguished among his
</p>
<p>brethren for learning, piety and comparative purity of conduct) I was led to think that
</p>
<p>Jetcanjee acted in Bombay as a kind of superior or principal over the other Maharajs,
</p>
<p>who from time to time came down here to officiate. But I was wrong : Jeicanjee was
</p>
<p>merely an equal among equals, when appealed to by some of the most respectable
</p>
<p>Vallabhacharyans in Bombay to interpose and put a stop to these practices, his answer
</p>
<p>was that he could do nothing. He admitted the alleged immorality ; he deplored it ;
</p>
<p>but he could not interfere with his brother Maharajs to prevent it : " Every man," he
</p>
<p>said " is master in his own house : all my fellow Maharajs here are my equals in
</p>
<p>rank, some of them my superiors in age, what can I do ?"
</p>
<p>As there was no available spirUual tribunal, so neither was there any criminal or

</p>
<p>civil tribunal which could take cognizance of these immoralities of the Maharajs. It was
</p>
<p>profligacy, it was vice, but it was not crime, it was not ciml wrong, of which they
</p>
<p>were accused. There was no violence ; there was no seduction. The wives and
</p>
<p>daughters of these sectaries, (with their connivance in many cases if not with their
</p>
<p>approval), went willingly went with offerings in their hands, eager to pay a high price
</p>
<p>for the privilege of being made one with Brahm by carnal copulation with the Maharaj,
</p>
<p>the living personification of Krishna.
</p>
<p>To what quarter then was a Vallabacharyan in Bombay to look for redress or
</p>
<p>reform if he felt aggrieved at these misdeeds of the Maharajs ? He had one resource
</p>
<p>and one only : to appeal to Public Opinion thmiigh the Press. This the defendant did ;
</p>
<p>as a Vallabhacharyan it was his ricfht, as the editor of a native journal it was bis
</p>
<p>27
</p>
<p>210
</p>
<p>duty to do so ; for if evils such as these were, (in the language of Lord EUenborough)
</p>
<p>' to exist for ever without public animadversion, one of the great uses of a free press
</p>
<p>is at an end." (I Campb. 117.)
</p>
<p>And the pubHc which thus constitutes the only tribunal to which the defendant
</p>
<p>could appeal had an interest and a duty in relation to the subject matter of the alleged
</p>
<p>libel, corresponding to his own. No public can be conceived to exist which has not an
</p>
<p>interest in the discouragement and suppression of such wickedness  upon which there is
</p>
<p>not imposed a moral and social duty of taking all legitimate means for its discour-
</p>
<p>agement and suppression. The offence attacked in the alleged libel is an offence against
</p>
<p>the first principles of morality on which all society is based, and in the suppression of
</p>
<p>which the highest interests and the highest dutie% of all Society, as such, are most in-
</p>
<p>timately concerned.
</p>
<p>If while writing with a single purpose to discourage and suppress this evil, the
</p>
<p>defendant, in the course of reflecting on the class to which the plaintiff belonged and
</p>
<p>on the plaintiff as a member of that class, published that which by inference, was defa-
</p>
<p>matory of the plaintiff as an individual, the occasion, in my opinion, justified him in
</p>
<p>so doing, and the defamatory matter, so published, is no libel, unless it can be shown
</p>
<p>either that he wantonly singled out the plaintiff for attack, or, unless his language was
</p>
<p>an excess of nshat the occasion warranted.
</p>
<p>Now did the defendant single out the plantif for attack^ On the contrary it is
</p>
<p>clear that the inunediate occasion of the attack, {if attack it can be fairly called') on
</p>
<p>the plantiff, arose out of the plaintiff's own act in having himself had recourse to the press
</p>
<p>for the purposes of controversy. This is plain on the face of the libel itself, and is put
</p>
<p>beyond all doubt by the evidence. The plaintiff had for some time been publishing a
</p>
<p>series of articles of a controversial character in the Bombay press, in some of which
</p>
<p>the defendant as a writer on the opposite side, was or fancied he was reflected upon :
</p>
<p>Some of those articles the plahitiff through his secretary Goverdhundass, had sent and
</p>
<p>caused to be inserted in the defendant's own paper the Satya Prakash; others had ap-
</p>
<p>peared in the Chabook, and other native newspapers ; others again were published in
</p>
<p>the Swa-dharmavardhuk (" The Propagator of Religion") a monthly periodical of which
</p>
<p>the plaintiff was the originator and principal manager.
</p>
<p>There can be no doubt on the evidence that the prominence given to the plaintiff
</p>
<p>among all the other Maharajs in the alleged libel, is owing to two articles of the
</p>
<p>plaintiffs (or which the defendant supposed to be the plaintiffs) and which appeared,

</p>
<p>the one in the Chabook, the other in the Susa-dharmavardhuk on the 16th and 29th of
</p>
<p>Sept. 1860.
</p>
<p>In these articles, says the defendant, " the Mahai-aj had spoken disparagingly of
</p>
<p>those reformers who write without quoting the Shastras." " I therefore," he goes on
</p>
<p>" proceeded on that hint to write according to the Shastras and produced the article which is
</p>
<p>the subject of the present action on the primitive religion of the Hindus."'
</p>
<p>The alleged libel was published on the 2\st October 1860.
</p>
<p>The title is " On the Primitive Eeligion of the Hindus."
</p>
<p>It commences by citing the Shastras (" the Veds and Purans") to show that in
</p>
<p>211
</p>
<p>the Kali Yug (or iron age) many heresies and false rehgions will arise, but the Kali
</p>
<p>Yug began 5,000 years ago and the Vallabhacharyan sect sprang up less than 400
</p>
<p>years ago : it is therefore (the logic is somewhat at fault here), a heresy.
</p>
<p>He then cites from one of the plaintiffs September articles a passage in which the
</p>
<p>plaintiff represents the different modern sects as so many extensions, not divergencies
</p>
<p>from the old religion, " just as some leave the Fort to proceed to Byculla, others to
</p>
<p>Walkeshwar."
</p>
<p>The defendant critises this illustration and then returns to his former point that
</p>
<p>the recent date of the Vallabhacharyan sect proves it, on the authority of the Hindu
</p>
<p>Shastras, to be heresy.
</p>
<p>Then he adds, " Thus as regards the weapons with which the Maharaj has come
</p>
<p>forth to defend himself, those very weapons will oppose the Maharaj and annoy him."
</p>
<p>Then follows Goculnathjee's verse and the indignant comments on it ; and then
</p>
<p>comes the conclusion of the article, ichich iijion the evidence as presented hy the
</p>
<p>plaintiff' and apart from the fresh light which has been thrown vpon the case hy the
</p>
<p>evidence for the defendant, the Court, on the application to nonsuit, considered to be
</p>
<p>prima facie libellous.
</p>
<p>" Jadoonathjee Maharaj (the Plaintiff) has commenced issiiivg a small work styled,
</p>
<p>The Propagator of our own Eeligion.' We ask him. In what way do you wish to
</p>
<p>effect the propagation of Religion ? Your ancestors, having scattered dust in the eyes
</p>
<p>of simple people, made them blind : Do you wish to make them see ; or, taking a
</p>
<p>false pride in the upholding of your religion, do you wish to delude simple people still
</p>
<p>more ?
</p>
<p>" Jadoonathjee Maharaj ! should you wish to propagate or to sp-ead abroad religion,
</p>
<p>then do you personally adopt a virtuous course of conduct, and admonish your other
</p>
<p>Maharajs, that as long as the preceptors of religion shall themselves appear to be im-
</p>
<p>mersed in the Sea of Licentiousness, for so long they shall not be competent to convey
</p>
<p>religious exhortation. Goculnathjee, having composed the commentary above mentioned,
</p>
<p>has attached to your Vaishnava persuasion a great blot of ink. Let that be first
</p>
<p>removed : scorn the writer of the commentary. Y^ou Maharajs, acting up to that
</p>
<p>commentary, defile the wives and daughters of your devotees. Desist from that and
</p>
<p>destroy at once immorality such as that of the company as the Eus festival. ^4^ long
</p>
<p>as you shall not do so, for so long you cannot give religious admonition and propagate
</p>
<p>your religious faith. Do you he assured of that."

</p>
<p>Is it not plain that the whole of this portion of the alleged libel is addressed
</p>
<p>prominently and pointedly to the plaintiff, simply because the plaintiff had put himself
</p>
<p>prominently forward as the originator and editor of the periodical called the " Pro-
</p>
<p>jpagator of the Faith ?" Is it not clear that the plaintiff's voluntary appearance
</p>
<p>before the world in that capacity is the key-note to the whole of this part of the
</p>
<p>article ?
</p>
<p>From the whole frame work of the alleged libel as explained by the evidence, the
</p>
<p>unavoidable conclusion is that the prominence given to the plaintiff throughout the article
</p>
<p>is not forced, groundless and malicious, but is the natural result of his having himself
</p>
<p>212
</p>
<p>entered into the lists of controversy as a champion of Vallabhacharyan orthodoxy, and a
</p>
<p>Propagator of the Vallabhacharyan faith.
</p>
<p>Then, lastly, is there on the face of the libel any evidence of erpress malice  is
</p>
<p>there personal rancour  is there an excess of bitterness  is there an unfair singling out
</p>
<p>of the plaintiff with a hostile desire to defame, to criminate, to malign ? I can see
</p>
<p>nothing of the kind.
</p>
<p>The plaintiff is not singled out ; he had voluntarily put himself forward as the
</p>
<p>champion and defender of the Maharaj cause.
</p>
<p>The attack is primarily on the class to which the plaintiff belongs ; incidentally the
</p>
<p>plaintiff bears the main brunt of the battle as being the one amongst that class who had
</p>
<p>invited attack by making himself its representative.
</p>
<p>The attack is on acts hostile to public morality done by the plaintiff not in his
</p>
<p>private capacity, but as Maharaj. The main object is not to attack at all, but exhorta-
</p>
<p>tion, earnest entreaties to lead a purer life and desist from licentious practices, and that
</p>
<p>tcith a view to the more successful propagation of relic/ion.
</p>
<p>The paramount motive, as deducible from the writing itself, is not personal rancour
</p>
<p>against the plaintiff ; but an ardent desire to put an end to a flagrant and shameful
</p>
<p>licentiousness, in the suppression of which the defendant and his co-religionists were
</p>
<p>vitally interested, and in the practice of which he had honest and bona fide reason to
</p>
<p>believe that the plaintiff, like all the other members of his class, was implicated.
</p>
<p>I agree with Dr. "Wilson in thinking that " all things considered, the alleged libel
</p>
<p>is a very mild expostulation," involving " an appeal to the principle that the preceptors
</p>
<p>of religion, unless they purify their lives, cannot expect success to attend their labours."
</p>
<p>I agree with Dr. Bhawoo Dajee that any reader of fair " average intelligence
</p>
<p>would understand the main object of the writer to be, not to make a personal charge
</p>
<p>of mal-practices against the plaintiff, but to address a general exhortation to the class
</p>
<p>to which the plaintiff belongs, to desist from such malpi'actices."
</p>
<p>On these grounds I think there is no proof of " express malice ;" on the grounds
</p>
<p>previously stated I think there was a " jii-stifijinf/ occasion."
</p>
<p>I think the defendant, from his position and status, not only had an interest and
</p>
<p>acted on a right, but also fulfilled a moral and social daltj, in denouncing a great
</p>
<p>iniquity ;  I think he took reasonably sufficient care to inform himself of the facts
</p>
<p>before he published, and that what he published he, at the time, bona fide believed to
</p>
<p>be the truth ;  I think that, in addressing himself to the public he appealed to the
</p>

</p>
<p>right, and under the circumstances, to the only available tribunal ;  he appealed to
</p>
<p>those who, in relation to the subject-matter of the alleged libel had an interest and a
</p>
<p>duty corresponding to his own ;  I think that in- giving the plaintiff the prominence
</p>
<p>he has done in his article he was actuated by no malice, ' but simply dealt with the
</p>
<p>plaintiff as he found him, the representative and champion of his class ;  I think that
</p>
<p>in the language of the article itself there is no evidence of personal malice or malignity,
</p>
<p>but strong evidence of a public spirited desire to denounce and put down a crying
</p>
<p>scandal and wickedness which was a stain upon the credit of the writer's caste  on
</p>
<p>the name of his nation  on the dignity and honour of human nature itself.
</p>
<p>213
</p>
<p>For all these reasons I am of opinion that the article complained of is no libel, and
</p>
<p>tierefore that on the first issue the verdict ought to be for the defendant.
</p>
<p>II. The other great issue  (for on the minor points, on which I entirely agree
</p>
<p>,vith the Chief Justice, I shall add nothing to the reasons he has adduced in
</p>
<p>disposing of them)  the other great issue in this case is on the plea of justification.
</p>
<p>On this issue I am of opinion that every material averment  every averment which in
</p>
<p>any way relates to the nature of the Vallabhacharyan sect ; the character and position of
</p>
<p>the Maharajs in general, and of the plaintiff" in particular, is substantially proved.
</p>
<p>I shall distribute the remarks I feel called upon to make on this issue under
</p>
<p>four heads.
</p>
<p>First :  The evidence adduced as to the nature and tenets of the Vallabhacharyan
</p>
<p>religion.
</p>
<p>Secondly:  The evidence as to the light in which the Maharajs are regarded by
</p>
<p>the sect of which they are the spiritual chiefs.
</p>
<p>Thirdly :  The evidence as to the general character of the Maharajs for licentious-
</p>
<p>ness.
</p>
<p>Fourthly :  The evidence as to the personal immoralities of the plaintiff.
</p>
<p>I. As to the nature and tenets of the Vallabhacharyan religion. On this tonic it is
</p>
<p>not my purpose to make any lengthened remarks : the passages cited in the plea of
</p>
<p>justification have been proved and verified : that is, they have been shown to be genuine
</p>
<p>extracts correctly translated from works received as authorities to a geater or less ex-
</p>
<p>tent in the Vallabhacharyan sect. But it is obviously impossible to form any thing like
</p>
<p>an adequate judgment of any religious system on any mere series of extracts, especially
</p>
<p>when selected with an avowedly hostile object. It is only certain broad and general
</p>
<p>conclusions at which, aided by the very learned evidence adduced on this point, we
</p>
<p>can with any safety or satisfaction arrive.
</p>
<p>Dr. Wiison, who has studied this subject with that comprehensive range of thought,
</p>
<p>:he result of varied erudition) v\hich has made his name a foremost one among the
</p>
<p>-ving Orientalists of Europe, Dr. Wilson says,
</p>
<p>" The sect of Vallabhacharya is a new sect, inasmuch as it has selected the God
</p>
<p>Krishna in one of his aspects, that of his adolescence  and raised him to supremacy hi
</p>
<p>tl^t aspect."
</p>
<p>"It is a new sect in as far as it has established the Puhshti marg, or way
</p>
<p>of enjoyment in a natural and carnal sense."

</p>
<p>This succinct statement seems to contain the essence of the whole matter. It is
</p>
<p>Krishna, the darling of the 16,000 Gopees (or shepherdesses) ; Krishna the love-hero 
</p>
<p>the husband of the 16,000 princesses, who is the paramount object of Vallabhacharya's
</p>
<p>worship. This tinges the whole system with the stain of carnal sensualism, of strange,
</p>
<p>transcendental lewdness. See, for instance, how the sublime Brahminical doctrine of uni-
</p>
<p>tion with " Brahn" is- tainted and degraded by this sensuous mode of regarding the
</p>
<p>Deity. According to the old Brahminical tenet, " Brahm," the All-containing and In-
</p>
<p>destructible, the Soul of which the Universe is the Body, abides from eternity to
</p>
<p>214 ^
</p>
<p>eternity as the fontal source of all Spiritual existence : reunion with Brahm, absorption
</p>
<p>into Brahm, is the beatitude for which every separated spirit yearns, and which after
</p>
<p>animating its appointed cycle of individuated living organisms, it is ultimately destined to
</p>
<p>attain. The teachers of the Vallabhacharyan sect do not absolutely discard this great
</p>
<p>tenet, but they degrade it. I have no wish to wade through all the theosophic nonsense and
</p>
<p>Hastiness of the plauitiff's own chapter on "Adulterine Love ;" but one of the myths he
</p>
<p>thus cites on the authority of the Brahad Vciman Ptirdn, perfectly illustrates what I mean.
</p>
<p>For many ages the incarnations of the Veds prayed Shri Krishna, the most Excellent
</p>
<p>Being, for a sight of his form : the wish being granted, desire was produced in them
</p>
<p>and they prayed to Krishna to satisfy their hearts' desire, so that they might enjoy
</p>
<p>with him in the fo)-m of women : this desire also was granted, and the traditions, under
</p>
<p>the form of women enjoyed Krishna as Gopees with adulterine love in the mythical
</p>
<p>forest of " Vrij."
</p>
<p>The comment of the plaintiff (for he is without question the writer or dictator of
</p>
<p>this article) upon this is, that if there were any sin in adulterine love Krishna would
</p>
<p>not have turned these Veds into Gopees for the purpose of enjoying them ;  but there
</p>
<p>is no sin in such love when its object is God ; for " God is all form. He is in the form
</p>
<p>of father, and he is in the form of husband ; he is in the form of brother ; and he
</p>
<p>is in the form of son. In whatever shape one may wish to love God, his wishes are
</p>
<p>complied with accordingly."
</p>
<p>Thus then is the pure and sublime notion of the reunion of all spirits that animate
</p>
<p>living but perishable forms, with the Eternal Spirit, not limited by form debased into a
</p>
<p>sexual and carnal coition with the most sensuous of the manifestations or " avatars" of
</p>
<p>God.
</p>
<p>But it goes further than this : unition with Brahm in the Kali- Yu(/ (or Iron age)
</p>
<p>being no longer possible through the medium of mystical intercourse with Krishna; it
</p>
<p>must be obtained in some other way.
</p>
<p>The witness Mathuradass Lowjee explains in what way : this to what he says : 
</p>
<p>" The connexion with Brahm (necessary to the soul's " becoming one with Brahm)
</p>
<p>in the Kali Yug is only possible through the Maharaj. The connexion is to be had
</p>
<p>by carnal intercourse between the Maharaj and the Vaishnavas  the female devotees
</p>
<p>of the Vaishnava persuasion."
</p>
<p>This then is the order of descent : spiritual unition with Brahm : mystical coition
</p>
<p>with Krishna: carnal copulation with the Maharaj. For, as Dr.V/ilson says, and as we
</p>

</p>
<p>shall see more at large under the next head of evidence. "The Maharaj is considered
</p>
<p>by a great many of his followers as an Incarnation of God, as God incarnate according
</p>
<p>to Hindu notions, which are peculiar on that subject. The Vallabacharyans hold that
</p>
<p>Vallabhacharya and his official descendants are incarnations of the God Krishna, without
</p>
<p>holding that there is a complete embodiment of him in any one of* them."
</p>
<p>The religion which thus degrades the pure idea of spiritual re-union with God, into
</p>
<p>the gross reality of carnal copulation with its hereditary high priesthood, appears from
</p>
<p>the evidence to be sensuous in all its manifestations. Ras-lUa, or " amorous dalliance"
</p>
<p>is held forth as the highest bliss here. Ras-Ula is the principal employment of Paradise
</p>
<p>hereafter; one of the many amatory names of the Maharaj is "Ocean of Ras-llla ; ^
</p>
<p>215
</p>
<p>and when a Maharaj expires he is not said to die, but to extend himself to an im-
</p>
<p>mortality of Ras-Ula.
</p>
<p>The hymns or sacred songs of a sect are generally the most fervid exposition of their
</p>
<p>religious feelings. The hymns sung by the women of the Vallabhacharya sect in honor of
</p>
<p>the Maharajs and in their presence are certainly no exception to this general rule. They
</p>
<p>are passionate with all the passion of the East  Erotic pantings for fruition of a lover
</p>
<p>who is also a God : as it is said of the Gopees in the Vaishnu Pur an, " every instant
</p>
<p>without Krishna they count a myriad of years, and forbidden by fathers, husbands,
</p>
<p>brothers, they go forth at night to sport with Krishna the object of their love." So
</p>
<p>these hymns, sung at this day, as the plaintiff admitted, by the wives and daughters
</p>
<p>of the Vallabhacharyans to their Maharajs express the most unbridled desire, the most
</p>
<p>impatient longing for the enjoyments of adulterine love.
</p>
<p>" I have often," says Mathuradass Lowjee, " heard songs of an adulterous character
</p>
<p>sung by females before the Maharaj"  " Improper songs in favor of adultery," says
</p>
<p>Khuttow Mucconjee, " very shameful and indecent"  " your followers," such is the
</p>
<p>purport of the songs, " say that they are our husbands, but in fact you are our
</p>
<p>husband."
</p>
<p>Several translations of these songs v/ere before us, and they quite bear out the
</p>
<p>character thus given : I give a few extracts 
</p>
<p>" An excitement extrenae and great in my body is created."
</p>
<p>" The azure-coloured beauteous husband with me is sitting."
</p>
<p>" Without seeing his beauteous face even water will I not drink."
</p>
<p>"The amorous and beauteous husband by seeing oft I will live."
</p>
<p>" Restniin me not, oh my mother,"
</p>
<p>" To pay my homage to him daily I will go"
</p>
<p>" As to connectionshi|\ that of Krishna appears the only true one."
</p>
<p>" And all others seem to be imperfect."
</p>
<p>" He who tellfe may tell, we will permit him to do so,"
</p>

<p>"The sense of public shame no longer will I fear."

<p>" The sound of the jingliug of his toe-rings has deprived me of mj' heart."
</p>
<p>" The very personification of God you are."
</p>
<p>" Having married the Valabh husband with extreme love,"
</p>
<p>"By our submitting to the Valabh husband happy we shall be."
</p>
<p>" By his association the Vaikunt (Paradise) we shall gain."
</p>
<p>There is only one point left for consideration under this head, and that is, how far
</p>
<p>works regarded in the Sect as authoritative claim for the Maharajs the attributes and
</p>
<p>the worship of Gods.
</p>
<p>As 5,to this there can be no doubt that the extracts proved at the trial fully bear
</p>
<p>out the correctness of those set out in the plea of justification.
</p>
<p>"Whoever holds his spiritual guide and Shri Thakurji (or God) to be different
</p>
<p>and distinct shall be born a Sirhana" (a kind of bird).
</p>
<p>" We should regard our Guru as God, nay, as greater than God. For if God
</p>
<p>gets angry the Gurudev is able to save us from the effect of God's anger, whereas
</p>
<p>216
</p>
<p>if the Guru is displeased nobody is able to save him from the effect of the Guru's
</p>
<p>displeasure." " Therefore God and the Guru are necessarily to be worshipped. The
</p>
<p>" worship of the Guru is to be performed in the same way as the worship of God."
</p>
<p>" In this world are many kinds of creatures. Of them all the most fortunate are we who
</p>
<p>have sought the protection of the illustrious Vallabhacharyans, Shri Gosainji and their
</p>
<p>descendants, who are manifestly incarnations of God, the .Excellent Being himself."
</p>
<p>It is not necessary to go further : these passages claim for the Maharajs the same
</p>
<p>worship as is paid to God ; they claim for them also the character of incarnations of God.
</p>
<p>If these things are sanctioned by the authoritative works of religious sect,  if
</p>
<p>union with God is figured under the emblem of sexual intercourse ; if love for God is
</p>
<p>illustrated by the lustful longing of an adulteress for her paramour ; if paradise is
</p>
<p>spoken of as a garden of amorous dalliance ;  finally, if the hereditary high priests of
</p>
<p>the sect are directed to be worshipped as Gods and reverenced as the Incarnations of
</p>
<p>God  it is not a matter of surprise that the ordinary devotees should make little
</p>
<p>practical distinction between Krishna and the Maharaj  that they should worship the
</p>
<p>Maharaj with blind devotion ; and that their wives and daughters should freely give
</p>
<p>themselves up to his embraces in the belief that they are thereby commingling with
</p>
<p>a God.
</p>
<p>II. It remains to be seen upon the evidence adduced at the trial how far these
</p>
<p>teachings are carried out in practice ; and this brings me to the second head of enquiry,
</p>
<p>viz. in ichat light are the Mahamjs actualhj regarded hy their sectaries'^i
</p>
<p>On this point the evidence is ample : there is the evidence of the witnesses called
</p>
<p>in the first instance to launch the plaintiff's case ; there is the evidence of the de-
</p>
<p>fendant's witnesses ; the evidence of the witnesses called by the plaintiff in rebuttal of
</p>
<p>the plea of justification ; and the evidence of the plaintiff himself.
</p>
<p>The witnesses called in the first instance for the plaintiff were nmch more candid
</p>
<p>and explicit in their disclosures on this point than those who were called in rebuttal
</p>
<p>of the defendant's case. The latter from the stereotyped uniformity of their answers
</p>
<p>on certain points, and from the cautious restraint with which they spoke on others,
</p>
<p>had evidently been warned and tutored against being surprised into admissions that
</p>
<p>might be damaging to the plaintiff's cause. There was none of that caution about the
</p>
<p>earlier witnesses. What says Gopaldass Madhowdass, one of the most respectable of
</p>
<p>these witnesses ?
</p>
<p>" We fall prostrate before the Maharaj, and offer incense and flowers and money

</p>
<p>to him. Light is waved before him" (as it is to the image): "the female devo-
</p>
<p>tees worship him by swinging him in a swing :" " Some people in the sect say the
</p>
<p>Maharajs are Gods ; others deny it : some Bhattias and some Banyans believe the Maharajs
</p>
<p>to be Gods. Then follows an admission of certain disgusting and degrading observances :
</p>
<p>" The devotees take pan-sooparee after it has been chewed by the Maharaj and
</p>
<p>swallow it :" " They drink the water in which his dirty dlioti has been washed :" 
</p>
<p>" They call the water in which the Maharaj has put his toe the 'Nectar of the feet.' "
</p>
<p>Verjeevundass Madoicdass (the brother of the last witness and a Justice of the
</p>
<p>Peace), says  " Some Banyans believe the Maharaj to be God as well as Guru :" " When
</p>
<p>217
</p>
<p>Maharaj dies it is said of him lie is gone to Bas Lila Bistarya, an extension of
</p>
<p>amorous sport : When the Maharaj bathes himself I put saffron scent on his body :
</p>
<p>This is on festivals :" " The image is bathed on holidays with the same ablution :"
</p>
<p>" People in our sect perform menial offices for the Maharaj :" " I, though a Justice
</p>
<p>of the Peace, once sat on the coach-box and drove the Maharaj among the shoutings
</p>
<p>of the people."
</p>
<p>So much for the witnesses called in the first instance for the plaintiff; those called
</p>
<p>for the defendant brought forward a mass of evidence on the same point from which
</p>
<p>I will extract the more important passages.
</p>
<p>The defendant himself sa3'S, "The Maharajs are considered by their followers as
</p>
<p>incarnations of Krishna, as the very personification of the excellent Being:" " I have
</p>
<p>seen the devotees worship the Maharaj as God by waiving light, swinging, prostration,
</p>
<p>&c. I have seen the managers of the Maharajs giving water to the Vaishnavs to drink
</p>
<p>in which the Maharaj had bathed: it is from these things and from what they gene-
</p>
<p>rally speak among themselves that I infer they regard the Maharajs as Gods."
</p>
<p>Mr. Narrayen Dinnanathjee, one of the principal Interpreters of this Court, (but
</p>
<p>who in the interpretation which he permitted himself to give of the words " Bebhichar"
</p>
<p>and " Soorut," was, for the moment, more mindful, I fear, of his admitted friendship
</p>
<p>with the respectable High priest Jeeounjee, than of the strict line of his professional
</p>
<p>duty)  Mr. Narrayen Dinnanathjee was eager to establish that the jMaharajs in the
</p>
<p>Vallabacharya sect were merely regarded as Gurus, and that " like the Gurus of all
</p>
<p>other sects, they are worshipped with the same forms and ceremonies as the image,
</p>
<p>but not as Gods." But in cross-examination this gentleman was compelled to allow
</p>
<p>that " no other sects besides the Vallabacharyas have hereditary Gurus by natural descent
</p>
<p>or adoption;" "that in other sects Gurus are sexually ascetic;" that "eating chewed
</p>
<p>paiz-sonparee ; drinking the nectar of the feet ; swinging, rubbing and bathing the body
</p>
<p>with oils ; eating the dust on which they have walked, are not practiced towards the
</p>
<p>Gurus of other sects."
</p>
<p>I shall only add the evidence of two more witnesses for the defence : that of
</p>
<p>Malhuradass Loiejee and that of Dr. Bhaicoo Dajee.
</p>
<p>Mathuradass Loicjee, a grave and reputable person, earnest, of considerable
</p>
<p>reading, and unimpeached honesty ; a Vallabhacharyan by sect and a Bhattia by caste 
</p>
<p>gave the following evidence as to the point now under consideration : 
</p>
<p>" Puran-Purshotum is worshipped as God who is in Paradise; his incarnations

</p>
<p>are Vallabli, Vitalnathjee and tlieir descendants : Vallabh was the incarnation of the
</p>
<p>head of God." [ In this apparently extraordinary statement of doctrine this witness is
</p>
<p>borne out to the letter by the plaintiff.] " The Maharajs are regarded as the incarnation
</p>
<p>of God:" " the terms P uraii- P urshntiim and Maha-Prabhoo (Supreme God  Mighty
</p>
<p>God) are applied to the present Maharajs, especially in the act of worship: The
</p>
<p>major part of the Bhattia caste do worship the Maharaj as God and worship the pic-
</p>
<p>tures of each of the Maharajs and repeat thjir names as ' Jewanjee,' ' Juddanathjee!')
</p>
<p>in the act of worship, and worship them in a variety of ways. It is such worship
</p>
<p>as is enjoined in our books, for the most part it is the same worship as that of God
</p>
<p>in Paradise ; there is no such worship in any other sect ; they touch his feet ; they
</p>
<p>28
</p>
<p>218
</p>
<p>swing him in a swing ; there is a necklace put round his neck as there is round the
</p>
<p>neck of the idol ; they take up the dust on which lie hns trcd and put it into thtir
</p>
<p>mouths: When they worsliip they cry " j\Iaha I'raLlioo," " Shree PraMioo," &c.
</p>
<p>"In doing all this 1 will swear they worship the Maharnj, because the image is inside.
</p>
<p>Some members of my own family, my brother for instance  believe the Maliarajs to be
</p>
<p>Gods. The Maharajs obtain their Godship from birth, without reference to equalities of
</p>
<p>body or mind, or whether they may afterwards turn out to be ignorant, dtbauchcd,
</p>
<p>or otherwise."
</p>
<p>The last evidence for the defence I shall cite on this point is that of Dr. Bha-
</p>
<p>woo Dajee  a gentleman wlio in learning, freedom from prejudice, and general superi-
</p>
<p>ority of mind is among the foremost, if not the formost of the native citizens of Bombaj.
</p>
<p>This gentleman, by caste a Brahmin, is not a Yallalhacharyan by creed, but he has a
</p>
<p>very extensive medical practice among the more wealthy members of the sect, and
</p>
<p>has attended all the Maharajs who for the last ten or twelve years have visited
</p>
<p>Bombay.
</p>
<p>Dr. Bhawoo Dnjee says:  " The majority of their followers regard the Maharajs as
</p>
<p>incarnations of Krishna: they are worshipped as such, I have seen them wursiiipped."
</p>
<p>After the Maharaj has worshipped the image his followers worship him : more time
</p>
<p>is devoted to the IMahar j than to the image. I have seen women puc their hands to
</p>
<p>the soles of the Miharaj's feet and then apply them to their eyes; 1 have seen the
</p>
<p>water of the bath of the Maharaj distributed to his followers ; and I have seen them
</p>
<p>crowding in hu.idreds to drink it."
</p>
<p>Such are a few of the passages from the evidence of the witnesses or'ginally , called*
</p>
<p>for the plaintiff, and of the witnesses for the defendant as to the light in v.iiith the
</p>
<p>Maharajs are regarded by the devout majority ot their followers. 'io oppose this we
</p>
<p>have the evidence of the witnesses called by the plaintiff to rebut the plea ot justifi-
</p>
<p>cation, and the evidence of the plaintiff himself.
</p>
<p>As to the evidence of these witnesses, I may say generally that, except when it
</p>
<p>consisted of admissions in iiscreetly made, it produced very little cftect on my mind.
</p>
<p>Tiiese witnesses all knew perfectly well that they had to deny certain spcitic allega-
</p>
<p>tions, amongst which was the allegation that the Maharajs were regarded by their
</p>
<p>followers as Gods, or as Incarnations of God. 'J"he mode in wiiich they gave their
</p>
<p>testimony as to this point  the uniform and set styles of their answers to certain evi-
</p>
<p>dently expected questions, necessarily led to the inference in any n.ind, accustomed

</p>
<p>careiully to scrutinise testimony, that they had been tutored and trained as to the evi-
</p>
<p>dence whleh on this point was expected from them. That evidence was to the effect that
</p>
<p>they regarded the Maharaj as Guru, nut as God. In their examination in ciiief they
</p>
<p>kept pretty steadily to the mark ; but on cross-examination they were more than once
</p>
<p>incautiously betrayed into the expression of their real feelings and their geiuiine belief,
</p>
<p>I say real feelings and genuine belief, because it was impossible not to draw this infer-
</p>
<p>ence from the spontaneous earnestness of the one set of lepiies when contrasted with
</p>
<p>the forced, parrot-like manner of the other set of replies. " I love my Guru said one
</p>
<p>of these witnesses  Pursotumilass D(v/ram  " I worship him as I should God." " It
</p>
<p>is not possible" said another  Gocalduss Kessowdass  " It is not possible for a Maharaj
</p>
<p>to commit sin." " I regard the Maharaj as my Guru" said Bhoychand Cacelchund 
</p>
<p>219
</p>
<p>"we re<*ard him in the plaoe of God; I regard him as an Incarnation of God."  "I
</p>
<p>regard the Guru" said Mulncl^rnj/ Narrotum " as an incarnation of God ; The Guru
</p>
<p>would not commit sin ; I caunut s:iy wliether what would be sinful in other men would
</p>
<p>he lawful in the Guru." If we turn from the evidence of his witnesses to the evidence
</p>
<p>of the ' plaintiff himself on this point, what do we find ? a series of categorical nega-
</p>
<p>tions absolutely neutializtd by an important admission. " I am not" he says " an
</p>
<p>incarnation of Cod. 1 do not know that any of my followers regard me as an in-
</p>
<p>carnation of God : I know they ought to regard me as a Guru : 'J hey worship me as
</p>
<p>Guru ; as those wlio cause happiness through God ;  as guides to God : I have heard no
</p>
<p>one snv we are worsliipped as Gods ! but because we give religious instruction they
</p>
<p>worship us as Gurus."
</p>
<p>Such are among the principal of the plaintiffs positive denials of the imputation that
</p>
<p>any of the sectaries worshipped the Maharajs as Gods, or as incarnations of God. But
</p>
<p>he too, with all his craft and caution, was compt-lled, under the pressure of cross-exami-
</p>
<p>nation, to make an admission entirely fatal to the position thus taken up : the admission,
</p>
<p>viz. that till he taught them better some of the sectaries even in Bombr.y did believe ia
</p>
<p>the doctrine which he had previously denied that any of the sectaries ever believjd in
</p>
<p>any where, or at any time.
</p>
<p>" I have instructed my disciples" he says " that except two of the IMaharajs Vallabh
</p>
<p>and Gosaniji  whom I regard as incarnations of I.-ihvar (God) they should regard us as
</p>
<p>Gurus and not as Gods." As to Vallabh, the founder, the plaintiff agrees verbatim with
</p>
<p>Ma'haradass Lmcjee in the apparently extraordinary statement of doctrine, that " he is
</p>
<p>regarded  the incarnation of lhe head of God;" but as to all his other descendants,
</p>
<p>except Gosainji " I have taught the people" says the plaintiff that " they should
</p>
<p>regard us as Gurus only. I prevented all persons from heliering such a doctrine (as that
</p>
<p>all the descendants of Vallabh were incarnations of God) xmtil I presented them they
</p>
<p>did believe it: when I came hers some persons belieced it and some did not; the
</p>
<p>majority did not, the minority did." !
</p>
<p>"What then on this point is the result of the whole evidence ? In my opinion it b
</p>
<p>this :
</p>
<p>First : That many passages in the religious works ot these sectaries authorize the
</p>
<p>doctrine that the Maiiarajs are incarnations of God and ought to be so regarded and wor-
</p>
<p>shipped by their followers.
</p>
<p>2ndly. That in practice they are regarded and treated, at all events by the less

<p>reflecting portion of the Valiabhacliaryan sect as a sort of God-like, powerful, and
</p>
<p>mysterious beings who cannot couunit sin, who are to be worshipped with divine honours,
</p>
<p>and whose persons are so sacred that observances which with reference to mere mortals,
</p>
<p>would be infinitely disgusting, become pious and meritorious acts when done towards the
</p>
<p>Maharaj.
</p>
<p>The two next heads under which I propose to examine the evidence in support of
</p>
<p>the plea of justllicalion, are,
</p>
<p>3rdly. The eci lance as it rela'es to the c/eneral imm'yraUtics of the Maharajs.
</p>
<p>4lhly. The coidcn:e as il relales to the parlicular immoralities of the ylainliff.
</p>
<p>220
</p>
<p>Before going into this, a few general observations must be made on the comparative
</p>
<p>value and credibility of the three principal classes of teBtimony with which we have to
</p>
<p>deal, viz., 1, the testimony of the witnesses for the defendant. 2. That of the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses for the plaintiff. 3. That of the plaintiff himself.
</p>
<p>First, as to the witnesses for the defendant, it is impossible to have presided at
</p>
<p>this Ifngtlient'd trial witlioiit becoming aware, not only by the positive evidence tendered,
</p>
<p>but by the deaieanoiir and bearing of the crowds by which from day to day the
</p>
<p>Court was thronged, that the defendant and his witnesses gave their evidence on the
</p>
<p>unpopular side. The religious animosities of the sect, the social prejudices of 'the caste,
</p>
<p>the personal hatred and alienation of former friends, were all arrayed against them.
</p>
<p>They had to face sectarian obloquy and caste exclusion. They were not free even from
</p>
<p>the risk of personal assault. I will take two passages from the evidence given by the
</p>
<p>witnesses for the plaintiff to show the nature of the feeling that was arrayed against
</p>
<p>them. " Two persons came to me," says Gopaldass Madhotodass, " on the subject of
</p>
<p>outcasting the defendant for writing about the Alaharajs in the newspapers. They said ' as
</p>
<p>the Bhaltias have made a bundobust, we (Bunyans) should make one also." This was
</p>
<p>one or two days after the Bhattias had put their signatures to a paper got up to inti-
</p>
<p>midate people from giving evidence in this case the bundobust I mean which was made
</p>
<p>a subject of prosecution for conspiracy in the Court last Criminal Sessions. The two
</p>
<p>persons who came to me were Purbhoodass and Jeykissondass : they, I, and the defendant are
</p>
<p>all Banyans."
</p>
<p>Damodhur Madhoirjee said :  " If any member of the Yallabhacharyan sect is found
</p>
<p>to entertain opinions adverse to the rest of the sect, we should not believe him : we
</p>
<p>should have no intercourse with him ; he would be isolated in his own house ; we should
</p>
<p>remain aloof from him. I would regard persons who think the Maharajs guilty of
</p>
<p>wicked practices as outcastes : / icould not speak to Luckmklass KJnmjee and Mathu-
</p>
<p>radass Loicjee, because tltey have given evidence here against the Maharaj."
</p>
<p>To those who consider how little the Hindoo is accustomed to independent thought
</p>
<p>and independent action  how his whole life is circumscribed within the sphere of the
</p>
<p>family or the caste  how entirely the v^rhole social happiness not only of himself but
</p>
<p>of those nearest and dearest to him is blighted by that terrible penalty of outcasting
</p>
<p> (equivalent to the excommunication of the middle ages)  those who think of these
</p>
<p>things will probably be of opinion that nothing but a strong belief in the truth of what
</p>
<p>they have stated, and a firm conviction of the duty of stating it, could have impelled

</p>
<p>the witnesses for the defendant to come forward as they have done on his behalf.
</p>
<p>For the majority of these witnesses are not students, or editors, or non-believers, they
</p>
<p>are grave, reputable middle aged, family men, having a firm belief in the teachings of
</p>
<p>their ancient religion and a profound reverence for the authority of their ancient scrip-
</p>
<p>tures.
</p>
<p>Luckmidass Khimjee, one of the twelve leading Setts of the Bhattia caste  Mun-
</p>
<p>guldass Nathoohhoy ; the Banyan Justice of the Peace, the well known founder of
</p>
<p>Hindu Girls schools  Khuttow Mucconjee, Mathuradass Loicjee, and other witnesses of
</p>
<p>that stamp, are hardly likely to have come forward to give evidence they did not
</p>
<p>believe, in order to encounter general odium in the sect and determined dislike in their
</p>
<p>caste. Dr. Bhow Dajee is no* indeed a member of the sect or caste, but he hua
</p>
<p>221
</p>
<p>enjoyed an extensive and lucrative practice among the wealthy Vallabacharyans, and
</p>
<p>for the last ten or twelve years has attended every Maharaj who, during that period,
</p>
<p>has visited Bombay. It is scarcely probable, on the ordinary principles of human
</p>
<p>nature, that Dr. Bbovv Dajee, by the evidence he has given, should risk the loss of
</p>
<p>such a practice, except from a firm conviction that what he had to say was true, and
</p>
<p>that, being true, he ought to make it public. On the whole the fair inference as to
</p>
<p>the evidence for the defendants is, that being given at considerable risk and at consi-
</p>
<p>derable sacrifice, it would only be given under a sense of duty founded on a firm
</p>
<p>conviction of its truth and of its public importance.
</p>
<p>The evidence of the witnesses for the plaintiff stands on a totally different footing.
</p>
<p>It is true these witnesses, with the same care with which they denied all knowledge
</p>
<p>of the fact that the Maharajs were ever regarded in any way except as Gurus, were
</p>
<p>sedulous to declare their conviction that if they ever saw or heard of any misdoings of a
</p>
<p>JVlaharaj, it tcould be their duty to tell the truth openly and not scruple to reveal the
</p>
<p>secrets of their Guru. But the value of these declarations was considerably impaired by
</p>
<p>the circumstance that several of these witnesses swore that till they came into Court
</p>
<p>they had never heard the morality of the Maharajs called in question, and that others
</p>
<p>declared that even if they had heard such reports they would not have believed them.
</p>
<p>" It is not possible for a Maharaj to commit sin" says Goculdass Kessowdass.
</p>
<p>" Every Maharaj is a good manj'' says Hiirgnmndass Moolchund, " a Maharaj can-
</p>
<p>not be a bad man : if I heard any report against the moral character of a Maharaj
</p>
<p>I would not believe it, nor could a Maharaj be guilty of bad conduct." " If' says
</p>
<p>Narrotumdass Ilurribhai " I heard a report of the licentiousness of a Maharaj, I should
</p>
<p>not believe it. A Maharaj would not do bad acts"
</p>
<p>It is important to bear these expressions in mind when we consider the nature of
</p>
<p>the evidence given by the plaintiffs witnesses as to the part of the case now under con-
</p>
<p>sideration. It is all purely negative evidence. It amounts to this : you the witnesses for
</p>
<p>the defendant say the Maharajs generally bore a bad character ; we the witnesses
</p>
<p>for the plaintiff say we never heard of it. Again ; you the witnesses for the defendant
</p>
<p>say the plaintiff himself bore a bad character at Surat, at Beyt, at Dwarka : well we
</p>
<p>are witnesses for the plaintiff  some of us came from Surat, some from Beyt, some
</p>
<p>from Dwarka, one or more of us from every place in which you have proved affir-
</p>
<p>matively that the plaintiff bears a bad character, and we say that we never heard of
</p>

<p>obviously quite possible that the negative and affirmative evidence may both be true. It
</p>
<p>is obviously no contradiction of a man who says of another that he bore a bad character
</p>
<p>at such a place to bring lorward a third man, or, (if the place be a large one) half a
</p>
<p>dozen other men to say they never heard of such bad character. But when amongst
</p>
<p>those called to give this species of evidence you find a variety of persons who admit they
</p>
<p>would pay no attention to, nay, would disbelieve, the bad character if they even heard
</p>
<p>it, then this species of evidence, at the best singularly inconclusive, becomes for all
</p>
<p>practical purposes of absolutely no value whatsoever.
</p>
<p>There Is another consideration, if another were wanting, to show how little weight
</p>
<p>IS to be attached to the evidence on this part of the case, of the witnesses for the plain-
</p>
<p>tiff. They came forward at the call of what they and the great majority of their
</p>
<p>222
</p>
<p>co-sectaries regaHed as a sabred duty of religion, to give evidence in fivour of their
</p>
<p>Guru. Tliey asserted iiak-ed tliat it would be llit'ir duty to givo evid/nre aL'ainst their
</p>
<p>Guru, if lie ums in t!ie wrong, but it was never alleged or pretended that it v.ns
</p>
<p>not a duty to give evideiu'e in favour of the Guru, if he was in the right. And this
</p>
<p>was a duty, tiiy neglect of which wouKl expose them to the rep''oach,  the due perform-
</p>
<p>ance of which would entitle them to the applause of their sect and of their caste.
</p>
<p>Accordingly there was an obvious eagerness and alacrity on the part of the phiintifT'a
</p>
<p>witnesses to come forward and give their evidence on behalf of the Maharnjs  their
</p>
<p>Gurus if not their Gods  whom their opponents the reformers have had the prolane
</p>
<p>liardihood to attack. It is not to be denied that this feeling is an intelligible one-^
</p>
<p>lliat it is even in some degree a creditable one  but it is too obvious to need
</p>
<p>remark that it materially detracts from the value and reliability of the testimony that
</p>
<p>is mainly given under its i. fluence.
</p>
<p>If we now turn to the evidence of the plaintiff himself, it is too clear to admit of
</p>
<p>a doubt that the peculiar position in which he stands most materially affects the value
</p>
<p>of the evidence he gives, especially in repelling the peronal charges that have been
</p>
<p>made against himself. It has been urged, and with substantial truth liy the counsel for
</p>
<p>the plaintiff, that, in repelling the charges male on this plea of justification, the plain-
</p>
<p>tiff is in the same position as if he were a defendant endeavouring to clear himself
</p>
<p>from a criminal accusation. He is so except in one res[)ect ; he can be ex-imined on
</p>
<p>his onth in his own defence which the defendant in a criminal trial cannot. The law
</p>
<p>of England, which allows no evidence to be given except on oath, recognises the exis-
</p>
<p>tence of cases in which the sanction of an oath ceases to be any effectual guarantee lor
</p>
<p>truth. Where a m m's life and liberty are at stake, it considers, and ri,.^htly, that his
</p>
<p>mere oath, as a sanction for truth, would be utterly valueless, and therefore, as it ad-
</p>
<p>mits tio evidence except on oath, it prohibi s the defendant in a criminal case from
</p>
<p>giving any testimony at all as a witness on his own behalf It is not so in cases which
</p>
<p>involve a man's reputation, though it is obvious that in all cases where the imputa-
</p>
<p>tions on character are grave and serious  and in precise proportion as they are grave
</p>
<p>and serious  ike value of the "plaintiff's oath as a sa>iction for the truth of his lesti-
</p>
<p>mont/ becomes almost infinitesimally small. The plaintiff, as the old phrase runs, " gives
</p>
<p>liis evidence with a rope about his neck :" lie has an interest in denying the charges
</p>
<p>made against hitn, which becomes stronger in the exact proportion in which those charges
</p>
<p>become graver  until, in ca-res of very serious imputation, it may well be doubted

</p>
<p>whether, even in the most truth loving of countries, the sanction of an oath, as such, is
</p>
<p>practically of any value at all as a guarantee for truth. The truth, in such cases,
</p>
<p>nmst be tested by other means than those of mere oath against oath.
</p>
<p>With these general observations I pass on to consider the evidence umlei' the third
</p>
<p>of the proponed heads if inquinj, vi;:., as it affects the general character of the Mctha-
</p>
<p>rojs for licentiousness and deb-mchery.
</p>
<p>The evidence on this head is exceedingly voluminous, and I shall only select some
</p>
<p>of the more prominent passages. I will pass by the evidence of the defendant, to which
</p>
<p>reference has already been made, in considering the question of libel or no libel, and
</p>
<p>jro on at once to that of Mathuradass Lowjee, a well-informed and highly respectable
</p>
<p>witness, Vullabhachuryau by sect aaid Jihattia by caste. *' frum childhood," says Matliura-
</p>
<p>22S
</p>
<p>dass Lowjee, "when my father used to tell me that the practice of adultery by the
</p>
<p>j\!:ili;ir;ijs was not in accordance with the old religion, I liave had ii y attention turn-
</p>
<p>ed to tliijse practices. Many persons know of those practices, but they don't avow
</p>
<p>lliem fur many reasons. I began to explain to my friends about eight or ten years
</p>
<p>ago that the Maliarajs practising adultery is wrong. In 'he year 1855 my caste took
</p>
<p>measures to prevent the adultery of the Maharajs, and I joined them : they made a
</p>
<p>writing and gave it. They proposed to put a stop lo it by preventing the women from
</p>
<p>going at night to the Maharajs' temples. The Maharajs issued a handbill lately to pre-
</p>
<p>vent that writing from being brought forward in evidence in this Court. It was resolved
</p>
<p>at the time that the writing should not be brought into force till after the lapse of a
</p>
<p>year. I'iiat was, lest the Bliooleshwur Brahmins should say something against the Ma-
</p>
<p>harajs if the writing were published."
</p>
<p>In oross-e.-^aniination he says, " I was present at this meeting. I will swear a
</p>
<p>resolution was passed about adultery, a resolution prohibiting females from making d ir-
</p>
<p>sliun at nii^lit tlirough the cold season. That was not owing to the danger of their
</p>
<p>being in the streets at night : the reason teas to preumt their beimj defiled by tht Ma-
</p>
<p>harajs.''
</p>
<p>The witnpss then goes on to describe the particular acts which he has himself wit-
</p>
<p>nessed. "Several Maharajs p-ess the hands of their female devotees with their feet:
</p>
<p>this is a sign for the purpose of connnitting adultery. When the woman looks towards
</p>
<p>the Maharaj, he makes signs with his eyes and smiles, and minding these suiiles, the
</p>
<p>woman goes accordingly into an inner room if the signs indicate tliat she should. I
</p>
<p>know this of my own knowledge." 'J'he witness then mentioned the names of two Ma-
</p>
<p>harajs whom he had often seen making signs to women, and, in one case, a grossly
</p>
<p>indecent gesture capable of only one meaning : he swore that he had frequently seen
</p>
<p>women going into anl co.ning out of the bed-roons of the Maharajs, and related with
</p>
<p>minute de ail a scene of actual sexual intercourse between a .Maharaj and a liliattia fe-
</p>
<p>male wliicii, he in common with several respectable witnesses whom he named, had
</p>
<p>seen going on in the garden-house of Goculdass Tej[iall.
</p>
<p>With regard to the dedication of " t't,7?, mnn, a'lil dJ/n/?," he said " This dedica-
</p>
<p>tion does not lake place with females till they are goin.i to he mairied: it is made to
</p>
<p>Krishn-1. The Maharaj represents Krishna as seated in the Sidhant Kahasya ; there is
</p>
<p>no d. [Terence as far as the dedication is concerned, between Krishna and the Maharaj.
</p>
<p>As to the women, after the dedication the Maharaj does as he likcs : lie commits

</p>
<p>adultery with them ; there are names of the Maharaj indicating this ; one is ' Kas-
</p>
<p>Lila  Mahodadhi,' ' the ocean of amorous sport,' meaning that he can have intercourse
</p>
<p>with many women like Krishna. It is notorious among our peojile that, alter dedica-
</p>
<p>tion, the Maharas do what they like with our wives and daughters. It is notorious
</p>
<p>througii the whole world that the Maharajs are guilty of adulterous practices. Though
</p>
<p>this is so notorious, they retain their intlueiice in the sect."
</p>
<p>The witness then goes on to relate the result of an appeal to Jewanjee Maharaj,
</p>
<p>to put a stop to these scandals  " Jewanjee said ' All persons are masters in tiieir own
</p>
<p>houses ; adultery has increased very much ; it is difficult to put a stop to it. I can-
</p>
<p>not say anything to my elders nor to my equals. If I were to attempt to say any-
</p>
<p>tliing to any one. he would not mind me. All the Muharujs derive a great part of
</p>
<p>224
</p>
<p>iJieir income from women : how can they keep up their expenses if their incomes rudilerdy
</p>
<p>cease ? Like an opium eater, a man cannot suddenly give up the practice of lust to
</p>
<p>which he is addicted : it is difficult to abolish such a practice at once ; have patience,
</p>
<p>and I will endeavour to have it abolished gradually.' "
</p>
<p>This evidence, entirely uncontradicted and unshaken, corroborated as we shall see
</p>
<p>directly by other unimpeachable testimony, is to my mind conclusive as ' to the generally
</p>
<p>known existence of such practices. Jevvanjee does not attempt to deny the evil ; he admits
</p>
<p>and deplores his own powerlessness to suppress it.
</p>
<p>Dr. Bhawoo Dajee says,  " My opinion of the character of the IMaharajs for mora-
</p>
<p>lity with women is very unfavorable. I have attended three Maharajs (besides the
</p>
<p>plaintiff; for venereal disease. I personally, once almost publicly, remonstrated with Je-
</p>
<p>wanjee on the subject of these immoralities. He said he had no control over the others
</p>
<p>to prevent them from committing acts of adultery."
</p>
<p>Luckhmidas Khimjee says  "The general reputation of the Maharajs is very bad
</p>
<p>as regards adultery ; to my knowledge that bad reputation is well deserved. / know to
</p>
<p>my own knowledge of adulterous acts and general licentiousness on the part of the Ma-
</p>
<p>hartijs, of ten, twelve, or fifteen of them. IVie plaintiff himself described to me the
</p>
<p>acts and conduct of other Maharajs; naming eight or ten of them. He said they com-
</p>
<p>viittcd adultery ; that he had spoken to several to dissuade them ; and that ivith the ex-
</p>
<p>ception of one Maharoj whom he named, the others promised to desist from such practices.
</p>
<p>He said 'Do n t press me now, what income do I derive from you males? Most of my in-
</p>
<p>come is derived from females. If you make arrangements by which we may receive
</p>
<p>large dues we will give up these things.' After the Bhattia caste meeting of 1855, I had
</p>
<p>a conversation with Jeewanjee on the subject of adultery. Dr. Bhawoo Dajee was there,
</p>
<p>he said  ' Beform yourselves ; establish schools ; make arrangements to prevent the Maha-
</p>
<p>raj's from committing adultery to which they are addicted.' Jevvanjee said  ' The other
</p>
<p>Maharajs will not obey me ; the arrangement is difficult, the income of the Maharajs being
</p>
<p>prhicipally derived from women.' "
</p>
<p>Mr. Munguldass Nathoobhoy, referring to the same occasion, says  " Jewanjee ex-
</p>
<p>pressed regret at the existing state of things, but said some of the Maharajs get all their
</p>
<p>maintenance from women, and it would be very difficult for them to give it up."
</p>
<p>Such are some passages from the evidence given on this point by witnesses of the
</p>
<p>highest character and credit ; it was evidence not in any way shaken on cross-examination.
</p>
<p>How was it met on the other side ? What is there in the case of the plaivitiff to set against

</p>
<p>this mass of positive, varied, and yet concordant testimony ? Kothing but blank
</p>
<p>denial; the assertion of absolute ignorance or total incredulity.
</p>
<p>Take the plaintiffs own evidence ; he positively denies the conversation with Luck-
</p>
<p>midass Khimjee. As to the general subject, he says :  " I don't know whether any
</p>
<p>Maharajs have committed adultery. I have never seen them acting immorally with
</p>
<p>women. According to the prints, they are immoral ; I believe them to be innocent ;
</p>
<p>if guilty, it is contrary to the Shastras."
</p>
<p>The witnesses called by the plaintiff to rebut the plea of justification went much
</p>
<p>further ; they had never heard a word against the moral purity of any of the Maharaja
</p>
<p>225
</p>
<p>till a few months ago ; till they saw the imputations in the Bombay papers, till this
</p>
<p>trial commenced; nay, till thei/ came into court and heard those imputations for the first
</p>
<p>time suggested by the questions of counsel.
</p>
<p>This proves too much ; it is absolutely incredible except on the supposition that
</p>
<p>these people obstinately refused to see, or hear or believe anything unfavourable to the
</p>
<p>character of their Gurus ; that, like Goculdass Kissordass, Hurgovindass Moolchund,
</p>
<p>Nurrotumdass Hurribhoy, and others of their number, they believed it impossible for
</p>
<p>a Maharaj to be a bad man, or to commit sin ; that, therefore, if they heard any
</p>
<p>reports against the conduct of a Maharaj, they would steadily refuse all credence to them.
</p>
<p>Applying, then, to this part of the ease the most familiar rules established in the
</p>
<p>science of jurisprudence for the sifting and weighing of testimony, I find it wholly
</p>
<p>impossible to come to any other conclusion than this, that the Maharajs as a class were,
</p>
<p>and for years notoriously had been, guilty of the immoralities imputed to them by the
</p>
<p>defendant in the alleged libel and in the plea of justification.
</p>
<p>The fourth and last head under which I propose to review the evidence was that
</p>
<p>of the personal acts of immoralii)/ charged against the plaintiff in the plea of justification.
</p>
<p>Under this head the testimony mainly relied on, in rebuttal of the charges, is
</p>
<p>naturally and necessarily that of the plaintiff himself. It is obviously therefore, very
</p>
<p>desirable to obtain, if possible, some test or measure of the value and credibility of the
</p>
<p>plaintifTs evidence when relied on in contradiction of the evidence adduced by the de-
</p>
<p>fendant. Such a test of credibility presents itself  clear, decisive, not to be explained
</p>
<p>away. It is unfortunately connected with one of the most repulsive parts of the case.
</p>
<p>It is alleged by the defendant's witnesses  it is denied by the plaintiff  that, on two
</p>
<p>occasions in the year 1860, one shortly before and one shortly after the alleged libel,
</p>
<p>he was affected with siphylis. It is, moreover, alleged on one side and denied on the
</p>
<p>other, that he admitted having had similar attacks on previous occasions, when he hud
</p>
<p>resorted to a supposed mode of cure, not unheard of by those who have practised in the
</p>
<p>Criminal Courts of Europe.
</p>
<p>Now what is the evidence on this point? Luckmidass Khimjee states that the
</p>
<p>plaintiff requested him to bring Dr. Bhawoo Dajee to see him, as he was suffering from
</p>
<p>chancre (chandi) and had been so for seven or eight days ; that the plaintiff said that
</p>
<p>he had caught it from an abandoned woman in Bombay ; that he had once tried to
</p>
<p>cure himself of a similar attack by connection with an untainted woman, but that,
</p>
<p>though allowed by the Shastras, he did not like to try that mode of cure again, as the

</p>
<p>woman had caught the disease from him. So far Luckmidass Khimjee.
</p>
<p>The plaintiff, in his rebutting evidence, admits that Dr. Bhawoo Dajee was called
</p>
<p>in at the suggestion of Luckmidass Khimjee, but that it was with reference to the
</p>
<p>management of some girls' schools. He denies categorically that he ever told Lukmi-
</p>
<p>dass Khimjee that he had " chandi," or that he had any conversation with him in refer-
</p>
<p>ence to his complaint ; or that he ever admitted having had connection with impure
</p>
<p>women in Bombay, or that he ever said a word as to having formerly tried to cure
</p>
<p>himself by connection with a second woman to whom he communicated the complaint.
</p>
<p>Then comes the evidence of Dr. Bhawoo Dajee, who has medically attended all the
</p>
<p>29
</p>
<p>226
</p>
<p>Maharaja who, for the last ten or twelve years, have visited Bom))ay, and wlio, before
</p>
<p>Ills visit to the plaintiff, had attended three of the number for the venereal disease.
</p>
<p>Dr. Bhawoo Dajee says that, about the 20th of September 1860, he went to the plaintifTs
</p>
<p>house with Lukmidass Khimjee and Wishvanath Narayan Mundlick. On the retirement
</p>
<p>of these two witnesses, the plaintiff said he had " chandi :" he ascribed it to heat; he
</p>
<p>said  " The full particulars of the case would be communicated to me afterwards.
</p>
<p>Next morning,, the full particulars were conveyed to me by Goverdhundass, his Secre-
</p>
<p>tary ; Goverdhundass told me plaintiff was suffering from " chandi." I told him I
</p>
<p>must examine before I could prescribe. He wanted me to prescribe. I prescribed a
</p>
<p>simple ointment." In cross-examination. Dr. Bhawoo Dajee says  " I understood the
</p>
<p>plaintiff to say he had a discharge from the ulcer. I can say positively he used the word
</p>
<p>' chandi.' ' Chandi' has other meanings besides syphilitic ulcer : it is the slang term for
</p>
<p>chancre. A common ulcer would not be described as ' chandi.' ''
</p>
<p>In answer to this evidence the plaintiff says that when he consulted Dr. Bhawoo
</p>
<p>Dajee, he said he was subject to itches caused by heat (this agrees with Dr. Bhawoo
</p>
<p>Dajee's statement.) He admits that at the time he had sores on the private parts; he
</p>
<p>denies that they were venereal ; he denies that he ever used the word " chandi,'' the word
</p>
<p>he used was ' chatha' (a Guzeratee word for sore or eruption.) He declares that he
</p>
<p>never told Dr. Bhawoo Dajee that he would send a person the next day to describe
</p>
<p>his symptoms ; he admits that he sent Goverdhundass the next day to Dr. Bhawoo
</p>
<p>Dajee, but that he so sent him in order to bring back a manuscript. " I said to
</p>
<p>Goverdhundass, ' bring any medicine he may give you, and bring back the work.'
</p>
<p>Goverdhundass brought back the prescription."
</p>
<p>Now, apart from the use of the word " chandi," which Dr. Bhawoo Dajee posi-
</p>
<p>tively affirms and the plaintiff positively denies  the important contradiction here is the
</p>
<p>denial that the plaintiff ever promised to send, or did in fact send, Goverdhundass to
</p>
<p>communicate to Dr. Bhawoo Dajee the history of his case. There was one person who
</p>
<p>could set this point at rest, and that was Goverdhundas himself. "Was he called as a
</p>
<p>witness ? No. Was any excuse offered for not calling him ? None. What is the legiti-
</p>
<p>mate inference ? Why, that if called, he would have been compelled, under pressure of
</p>
<p>cross-examination, to admit that he was sent by the plaintiff to relate the history of his
</p>
<p>symptoms and that those symptoms were what Dr. Bhawoo Dajee stated them to be.
</p>
<p>This was on or about the 20th of September :  about three months later, in De-
</p>
<p>cember 1860, Dr. Dhirajram Dulpatram is called in : " The plaintiff," says this witness,

</p>
<p>*' told me the nature of his complaint ; I ocularly inspected the part ; it was a siphylitic
</p>
<p>ulcer on the ghns jjenis. The history of the case given by my patient quite confirmed
</p>
<p>my opinion as to the ulcer being siphylitic. I personally inspected the parts six or
</p>
<p>seven times. I attended him for a month. Externally black wash was appUed, internally
</p>
<p>mercury : he continued the mercury treatment till he was salivated. The sore disap-
</p>
<p>peared within a month. He told me he had suffered in the same way about three
</p>
<p>months before, in consequence of impure connection with a woman. I am sure he did
</p>
<p>not tell me he had eaten a great many chillies, nor that he had prickly heat. In the
</p>
<p>course of my visits, I remember his asking me whether the disease could be removed
</p>
<p>by intercourse with a fresh female ? I said  no.' He said he had tried it twice with
</p>
<p>227
</p>
<p>fresh Banyan females, it had succeeded the first time, not the second, because he
</p>
<p>was then somewhat out of condition. He said he had tried these experiments at Surat."
</p>
<p>Such is the positive evidence of Dr. Dhirajram. What does the plaintiff say in
</p>
<p>reply ?
</p>
<p>"I consulted Dr, Dhirajram, and took the medicines he prescribed: I described my
</p>
<p>case to him : it was of the same character as when Dr. Bhawoo Dajee came ; it had
</p>
<p>recurred. I described it as I did to Dr. Bhawoo Dajee : 1 said it was caused by heating
</p>
<p>medicines and scratching : I did not describe it as siphylitic ' chandt : he did not inspect
</p>
<p>the parts. I had had no impure connection with a woman. Eow could I, it is contrary
</p>
<p>to our religion to have such intercourse. I did not tell him I had such intercourse. I
</p>
<p>did not tell him * chandi,' would be removed by intercourse with a clean woman; I did
</p>
<p>not ask whether it could. I did not tell him I had tried the experiment twice, and
</p>
<p>that the second time it had not succeeded."
</p>
<p>"With regard to the medicines prescribed and the effect of them, the plaintiff says
</p>
<p> " He gave me some powders which were mixed with water : the liquid was dark. I
</p>
<p>used this black wash ; the lime water for it was prepared in my own place. I put the
</p>
<p>powder into it and so made black wash, which was applied. I took five or six pills.
</p>
<p>Jfter I took the medicine for Jour or f.ve days, I suffered pain in the throat and left off.
</p>
<p>After the pain in the throat came on, I did not go on taking a pill a day; he gave
</p>
<p>me a jireparation of borax and water to be used when the throat became sore. My gums
</p>
<p>pained me slightly. When this took place the sore had been cured.''
</p>
<p>Now what is the result of this evidence? Why that plaintiff admits he was
</p>
<p>mercurially treated, both internally and externally till salivation was produced ; that when
</p>
<p>salivation was produced, or shortly after the sore was cured, that that sore was an
</p>
<p>ulcer on the glans penis  and yet that that ulcer was not siphylitic. An ulcer on the
</p>
<p>glans penis, mercurial treatment, a doctor who, after six or seven inspections, declares
</p>
<p>the ulcer to be siphylitic  this is the evidence on the one side. The mere denial of
</p>
<p>the plaintiff, who has a life-and-death interest in making that denial, is the sole
</p>
<p>evidence on the other. If the matter rested here, could any person accustomed to weigh
</p>
<p>evidence, have the shadow of a reasonable doubt left on his mind as to where the
</p>
<p>truth lay ? But it does not rest here : it was elicited from the plaintiff that the part
</p>
<p>affected had been subjected to minute and microscopic observation by three medical
</p>
<p>gentlemen in the course of the trial ; and yet not one of those medical gentlemen did
</p>
<p>the plaintff venture to put into the ivitness-box. It would be idle to comment on such

</p>
<p>a circumstance as this : even in a doubtful case it would have turned the balance against
</p>
<p>the plaintiff; in a case like this, free without this circumstance from all reasonable doubt,
</p>
<p>it renders it absolutely impossible to come to any other conclusion than that the
</p>
<p>plaintiff was affected with siphylis, both in September and December of the year 1860.
</p>
<p>And this conclusion is all important in its bearing on the value and credibility
</p>
<p>of the plaintiff's evidence : it is not only that having deliberately perjured himself on
</p>
<p>this one occasion, his oath where he stands alone in contradiction to credible testimony,
</p>
<p>is utterly valueless for all purposes and on all occasions  it goes further than this : the
</p>
<p>fact, as to which doubt is impossible, that the plaintiff had siphylis on two occasions in
</p>
<p>228
</p>
<p>the year 1860, shakes to pieces the whole frame-work of his evidence and shows it all
</p>
<p>to be conceived in a spirit of hypocrisy and falsehood.
</p>
<p>With great tact and plausibility, the plaintifiF assumed, throughout the whole of his
</p>
<p>very lengthened evidence, a tone of parental piety, an outraged purity. When asked
</p>
<p>whether he had toyed with the bosom of the young lady in the temple at Beyt, his
</p>
<p>answer was " How can I commit such an act as touch the breast of a woman, wJieti
</p>
<p>I regard all women as my children." Again, when questioned as to his still closer in-
</p>
<p>timacy with a young married lady in Bombay, he repeats the expression " I regard all
</p>
<p>women as my children." Again he says " would I have told Kallabhoy Lallubhoy that
</p>
<p>there is no harm in adultery when adultery is strictly prohibited in our religion? How
</p>
<p>could I invent such a new thing" (as to say that illicit intercourse is good for the
</p>
<p>health) " when I had no experience, never having committed adultery in all my life ; it
</p>
<p>is a thing I hate. Amongst us these things are strictly prohibited ; it is laid down
</p>
<p>that intercourse with one's own wife is lawful, but that intercourse with any other
</p>
<p>woman is unlawful. That includes intercourse with cusbans"  he said in answer to a
</p>
<p>question of mine, and we have just seen how in denying that he ever had intercourse
</p>
<p>with an impure woman, he exclaimed " How could I, it is contrary to our religion to
</p>
<p>have such intercourse."
</p>
<p>Convinced as I am on evidence the most clear and conclusive that this man labored
</p>
<p>under an attack of siphylis, the result of impure connection, about the very time this alleged
</p>
<p>libel was published, I am constrained to regard these expressions of simulated purity as.
</p>
<p>the offensive language of hardened hypocrisy.
</p>
<p>There is another respect in which a material, but to me always a most incredible, part
</p>
<p>of his evidence is utterly shattered by the conclusion at which I have been compelled to
</p>
<p>come, as to his having been under treatment for venereal disease in 1860. The plaintiff
</p>
<p>himself most positively swore, and his personal attendant swore quite as positively, that
</p>
<p>while a young man in the prime of life, for the space of four years, all of which were
</p>
<p>spent without a wife, and two of which were spent on pilgrimage  the plaintiff, never on
</p>
<p>any one occasion, had carnal intercourse with any woman of any rank or class whatsoever.
</p>
<p>The statement upon the face of it, seemed in the higliest degree improbable : here was a
</p>
<p>young Hindu  a Maharaj  no ascetic  the hereditary high priest of a religion of enjoyment
</p>
<p>with the amorous Krishna for its god, and an ocean of Bas Lila for its paradise  in the vigour
</p>
<p>of early manhood, without a wife, on pilgriirage, never once in the space of four years
</p>
<p>having sexual intercourse of any kind with a woman. A less probable story was hardly ever

<p>sworn to in a Court of justice : but what shred, what rag of probability is left to cover
</p>
<p>the nakedness of this transparent He, when we find this alleged purist in matured life, in
</p>
<p>the city of his enemies, with a wife and family in his dwelling-place, so little capable of
</p>
<p>controlling his sexual passions as to purchase pleasure at the price of disease. It has been
</p>
<p>said that if the plaintiff had an unlimited command of pure women, he would not have re-
</p>
<p>sorted to those who were impure : there is no force in the remark : polygamy and court-
</p>
<p>ezanship are always found to flourish side by side, and it requires but a very moderate
</p>
<p>knowledge of the world and of history to be aware, that the women who make plea-
</p>
<p>sure a profession are not least patronized by those for whom immoderate indulgence has
</p>
<p>tendered the sexual act at once a necessity and a weariness.
</p>
<p>Tor the reasons indicated, I find it utterly impossible to treat the plaintiffs mere oath
</p>
<p>229
</p>
<p>as of" any value at all when it stands alone in opposition to the evidence of credible
</p>
<p>witnesses.
</p>
<p>Then, are the witnesses who depose to the particular acts of immorality with which
</p>
<p>the plaintiff is charged in the plea of justification credible witnesses? In my opinion,
</p>
<p>they are thoroughly so. These witnesses are Lukhmidass Khimjee, and the two young
</p>
<p>men Kallabhoy Lalloobhoy and Chutterbhooj Waljee. As to Lukhmidass Khimjee, his
</p>
<p>credibility is beyond suspicion : a grave, respectable, intelligent man, of the highest
</p>
<p>position in his caste, animated by an earnest desire to purify the practices of his sect,
</p>
<p>he gave his evidence in a quiet, calm, straightforward manner, eminently calculated to
</p>
<p>conciliate belief; nor was he betrayed into a single inconsistency or self-contradication in the
</p>
<p>course of a very long and searching cross-examination. The young Kyast, Kallabhoy
</p>
<p>Lalloobhoy  a son of the Sheristedar of the Sudder Adawlut, gave his testimony with ex-
</p>
<p>treme intellgence and in a frank, artless, natural manner, which unavoidably created the
</p>
<p>impression that he was honestly sj^eaking the truth. The young Bhattia, Chutterbhooj,
</p>
<p>was a less intelligent person, but he too gave his evidence calmly and clearly, nor
</p>
<p>was he shaken in a single paiticular.
</p>
<p>It was said that the testimony of these two young men was open to suspicion,
</p>
<p>because both were great friends of the defendant ; because one had also been his pupil for
</p>
<p>some time at the Elphinstone Institution, and the other was the nephew of Dr. Dhirajram.
</p>
<p>If they had told a less plain and unvarnished tale, if they had been shaken in cross-examination,
</p>
<p>if they had become confused, or hesitating, if they had shown any eagerness of par-
</p>
<p>tizansliip, I might have felt there was something in the suggestion ; though even then,
</p>
<p>it might fairly have been said that, in a case like this, no motive but one of friendship for
</p>
<p>the defendant, or earnest eal for the reform of the sect, could induce people to brave
</p>
<p>relate in open court what they knew of the mal- practises of the Maharaj. But consi-
</p>
<p>odium (and, if members of the sector caste  worse than odium) by coming forward to
</p>
<p>dering the mode in which these young men gave their evidence, the fact that one is a relation
</p>
<p>of Dr. Dhirajram and that both are friends of the defendant, though it may have s ipplied
</p>
<p>a reason for watching their testimony more closely, affords none for discrediting in any
</p>
<p>way the testimony which in fact they gave. And that testimony was wholly uncontradicted
</p>
<p>except by the mere denial of the plaintiff  a denial, which for the reasons already more
</p>
<p>than sufficiently indicated, may be regarded for all purposes of evidence as practically
</p>
<p>worthless.
</p>
<p>Kallabhoy Lalloobhoy, who seems to have been on very intimate terms with the plaintiff,

<p>speaks to two instances, one in Surat and one in Bombay, in which he witnessed facts that
</p>
<p>can leave no reasonable doubt of illicit intercourse between the plaintiff and two ladles of
</p>
<p>the Banyan caste. The first took place at Surat about three years ago : " I was sitting,"
</p>
<p>says the witness, " with the plaintiff and a male Banyan in his ' dewankhana.' A Banyan
</p>
<p>girl, about 14 or 15, came in with a female servant of the Maharaj. She passed through the
</p>
<p>' dewankhana' where we were sitting and went into the side room : the Banyan man immediately
</p>
<p>got up and went away ; the plaintiff left the room and went into that into which the
</p>
<p>female had gone. I was a boy at that time" (he would have been about 13) " I attempted
</p>
<p>after some time to go into the room which the Maharaj had entered : I expected folded pan-
</p>
<p>soparee, and I went to get it. I entered the room. I saw the Maharaj sitting with the girl
</p>
<p>on a couch embracing and kissing. I did Durshun (reverence) to him: he got up, took
</p>
<p>230
</p>
<p>me by the arm, and took me out ; he then gave me some pan-soparee ; I then left and he-
</p>
<p>went into the inner room again."
</p>
<p>That is the first case ; the second took place in Bombay, where the youth had renewed
</p>
<p>his intimacy with the plaintiff, and was well aware from conversation that had passed between
</p>
<p>them that his friend was acting in public the part of a reformer. Kallabhoy had his suspicions
</p>
<p>as to the genuineness of these professions. "In consequence," he says, " of what I heard
</p>
<p>about the plaintiff, I once watched a lady to his house. I heard people say, pointing to her,
</p>
<p>' that is a lady with whom the Maharaj has fallen in love.' I followed her to the
</p>
<p>plaintiff's house ; she entered a doorway inside the ' dewankhana.' I went into the
</p>
<p>' dewankhana' and sat there ; the plaintiff was there ; the plaintiff went inside into the
</p>
<p>room the lady liad entered. I did not go away. I remained sitting there about half an
</p>
<p>hour. The plaintiff came out ; he had only his waist-cloth on. I began to smile ; he asked
</p>
<p>me ' why are you laughing' (he was laughing too) I said ' you are certainly effecting a
</p>
<p>very great reform.' He laughed and said nothing. Presently, the lady came out; her
</p>
<p>dress was disordered. I looked at her and laughed. She laughed and went away.
</p>
<p>From her dress I can say she was a Banyan : from her dress and jewels, I concluded
</p>
<p>she was a respectable woman."
</p>
<p>That is the testimony of Kallabhoy,  testimony given with a simplicity of manner
</p>
<p>and naturalness of detail ;  v.'hich it would be difficult to surpass : testimony which,
</p>
<p>unshaken as it was by cross-examination and uncontradicted except by the bare denial
</p>
<p>of the plaintiff, I have no difficulty in believing to be substantially the truth.
</p>
<p>Chutterbhooj, who also appears to have been a good deal about the plain tiflTs
</p>
<p>house, deposes to having seen a third young lady introduced into the plaintiffs bed-room,
</p>
<p>and both he and Kallabhoy concur as to the fact of those conversations between them-
</p>
<p>selves and the plaintiff in which he maintained the doctrine, and confirmed it by the
</p>
<p>results of his own experience, that illicit intercourse with women is favorable to the
</p>
<p>health and vigour of the human system. These conversations are of course denied by
</p>
<p>the plaintiff, but it is also urged that they are intrinsically improbable. I do not think
</p>
<p>so. In this country, youths of 16 or 17 are often husbands and fathers ; in no
</p>
<p>country do we find that lads of that age are indisposed to enter into such discussions.
</p>
<p>As to the improbability of the plaintiffs taking part in them, would there, it may be
</p>
<p>asked, be any thing strange in a Mormon elder taking up such a topic in defence oi
</p>
<p>polygamy, if pressed hard in argument by a couple of young unbelievers in the merits
</p>
<p>of that patriarchal institution?

</p>
<p>And now as to the evidence of Lukhmidas Khimjee. I shall consider first that
</p>
<p>part of his testimony which relates to the plaintiffs conduct in Bombay, reserving to the
</p>
<p>last, the consideration of that which relates to his earlier immoralities at Beyt. Lukh-
</p>
<p>midass Khimjee, like many others, believed in the professions of reform with which the
</p>
<p>plaintiff introduced himself to the Vallabhacharyan public of Bombay. He was come to
</p>
<p>promote female education ; he was open to argument on the question of widows' remar-
</p>
<p>riages. It was known  and this is a fact which should be borne in mind to the plain-
</p>
<p>tiffs credit  that he had opened, and that he contributed to support, a flourishing
</p>
<p>boys' school at Surat, where instruction was given, amongst other things, in Sanscrit.
</p>
<p>These things more than countervailed with Lukhmidass Khimjee the scandals of the
</p>
<p>231
</p>
<p>plaintlfTs youth ; and ho appears, from the moment of his arrival in Bombay, to
</p>
<p>have entered into warm and friendly relations with the new Maharaj. " I called on the
</p>
<p>plaintiff," he says " the second or third day after his arrival. I was on friendly terms
</p>
<p>with him, saw him twice or thrice a day, invited him to my house, asked friends to
</p>
<p>meet him. I did this because he was making promises of effecting reform, abolishing
</p>
<p>these bad practices, and getting girls to be permitted to learn. I formed an opinion
</p>
<p>subsequently that plaintiff continued his former bad practices, and for three or four
</p>
<p>months I had been misled. One day I went to his house and was sitting conversing,
</p>
<p>when two females arrived : one of them had a silver goblet in her hand : she was
</p>
<p>about 20 ; the other was a widow about 40 ; the young woman was a Cutchee Bhat-
</p>
<p>tian, a married woman."
</p>
<p>The witness then goes on to state that the young lady having been conducted by
</p>
<p>a female servant into the bed room, the plaintiff sent him off to the printer's to make
</p>
<p>immediate arrangements for the publication of some article. " I went downstairs," says
</p>
<p>the witness, " but some suspicion crossed my mind, and after a short time I went up-
</p>
<p>stairs again into the same room : no one was there except the widow who was standing
</p>
<p>beside the door ; I continued sitting there till they came out. First the Maharaj came
</p>
<p>out : on observing me, he grew pale. Then the young lady came out : she was smiling
</p>
<p>and laughing ; her rose-coloured sarree was in a confused, rumpled state ; it had been all
</p>
<p>right when she went in. She had not the silver goblet. I presume she had given it to
</p>
<p>the Maharaj. Both the ladies shortly left, I remained. ' Nothing was said on the subject
</p>
<p>at that time, but " in the evening,'" " says the witness, " I went again : the Maharaj
</p>
<p>took me into an inner room to have some private conversation with me. He began :
</p>
<p>he said ' what have you done with regard to the opening of female and other schools ;
</p>
<p>speak to Munguldass, and others ; request their aid ; get up a subscription list.' I
</p>
<p>said * Maharaj, this is all sham ; you profess to be a reformer and to wish to open
</p>
<p>female schools ; and in private, you commit such bad acts, such adulteries.' His
</p>
<p>answer was ' yes, you might have suspected me, but I have not committed any bad
</p>
<p>acts ; I only went in to accept food from the female.' To this I replied ' you told me
</p>
<p>that when females came for that purpose you did not take them inside; if you went in
</p>
<p>to accept food, why did you leave the widow outside.' He did not answer that and
</p>
<p>changed the conversation."
</p>
<p>Such is the evidence of the defendants witnesses as to the immoralities of the
</p>
<p>plaintiff during his recent residence in Bombay. I have reserved for the last the con-

</p>
<p>sideration of the scene which Lukmidass Khimjee deposes to having witnessed fifteen
</p>
<p>years ago at Beyt. Here again, I shall let the witness speak for himself: 
</p>
<p>" There is a temple at Beyt dedicated to Luxmee : the plaintiff threw goolal there.
</p>
<p>There were females present : he threw the goolal on the females, then on a number
</p>
<p>of persons near the gate. When the goolal was thrown in two or three handfuls,
</p>
<p>persons outside the inclosure could not see what was going inside. Immediately after
</p>
<p>throwing the goolal, he squeezed the breasts of a young girl, a Bhattian, who was
</p>
<p>near the gate. She smiled. A few days after this, I and my uncle (Damodur
</p>
<p>Dewjee) went to the plaintiff^s house at Beyt : it was about one or half-past one o 'clock
</p>
<p>in the day ; he was lying in his bed. I and my uncle went up and began shampooing
</p>
<p>232
</p>
<p>his legs. It is usual to do so when the Maharaj is lying down : regarding him as
</p>
<p>a God, shampooing his legs is considered a pious act. While so employed, the girl,
</p>
<p>whose breasts the Maharaj had squeezed, came accompanied by a widow. The widow
</p>
<p>come up and whispered to the Maharaj. He said to us 'go out' I and my uncle then
</p>
<p>left the bedroom and went outside. The girl was left there; afterwards the widow
</p>
<p>came out and shut the door, and held the chain. The widow smiled and asked my
</p>
<p>uncle if I would like to see Ras-Lila. We went in. The plaintiff was in the act
</p>
<p>of having carnal intercourse with the girl inside. The plaintiff said to my uncle,
</p>
<p>' What will he (meaning me) give for seeing this.' My uncle said, ' He will do you
</p>
<p>service.' Before I went in I had agreed to give 100 Cutch cowries (about 30 rupees)
</p>
<p>for seeing the sight. I made my respects (durshun) and came out. I was then about
</p>
<p>18 or 19 year of age.'' " It is considered," continues the witness, " a pious act by
</p>
<p>Vaishnovs to witness the Ras-Lila of the Maharaj ; it is a custom in the sect to pay
</p>
<p>for witnessing this act ; both the sectary who sees, and the woman who is enjoyed,
</p>
<p>pay ; to have connection with the Maharaj is considered to lead to ' Gowloke' (the
</p>
<p>paradise of the 16,000 gopees.")
</p>
<p>Such is the sworn testimony of this very respectable witness, given with the most
</p>
<p>perfect simplicity and candour, given as though he was relating nothing extraordinary
</p>
<p> absolutely unshaken in cross-examination. The plaintiff, in answer to questions put
</p>
<p>by his counsel, contradicts absolutely and categorically the whole story. As to the value
</p>
<p>of that contradiction standing alone, nothing further need be said ; but on this part of
</p>
<p>the case, the plaintiff attempted to go beyond mere contradiction and called three
</p>
<p>witnesses to throw doubt on the statement of Lukhmidas Khimjee.by showing that in
</p>
<p>the temple he specifies at Beyt, the temple of Luxmee, goolal is never thrown on the
</p>
<p>worshippers, but only on the image, it being the temple of a female divinity The first
</p>
<p>of these witnesses Davidas Hunsraj, formerly superintendent, for the Guicowar, of the
</p>
<p>temples at Beyt, proves very little as to the point for which he is principally called,
</p>
<p>" Goolal," he says, " is thrown on the images in all the temples : but not on the
</p>
<p>worshippers when the image is female." But having thus laid down the rule, he
</p>
<p>admits there may be exceptions, for he adds " a witness may have seen it thrown on
</p>
<p>the worshippers at Luxmee temple ; I have not, that is all I mean."
</p>
<p>INIitharam Purshotum, a Bhattia from Kajkote, whose duty it was nine or ten years
</p>
<p>ago to follow the Maharajs round the temples of Beyt and collect the tax due to the
</p>
<p>Guicowar from the devotees, gives the following evidence :  " Goolal was only thrown

</p>
<p>on the worshippers in the temple of Dwarkanathjee at Beyt : it is thrown by the
</p>
<p>JUaharajs and the Brahmacharias.
</p>
<p>Premjee Pooja, the third witness, a Pokarna Brahman, who has come down to
</p>
<p>Bombay to act as cook, but who previously for twenty years had been a servant in
</p>
<p>the temple of Radajee, another female divinity at Beyt, contradicts witness No. 2 in
</p>
<p>two important particulars. Agreeing with him that Goo'al in Luxmee temple is only
</p>
<p>sprinkled on the image, he swears that even in the temple of Dwarkanathjee, it is only
</p>
<p>thrown on the musicians, not on the worshippers, thrown not by the Maharajs at all,
</p>
<p>only by the Brahmacharias.
</p>
<p>Even if the point were a material one, it is clear that this evidence of contradiction
</p>
<p>233
</p>
<p>wholly fails : but the point is not a material one ; the evidence of these yery three
</p>
<p>witnesses shows this temple of Luxmee at Beyt to be one of five small shrines
</p>
<p>dedicated to different gods and goddesses, all of which are in close proximity.
</p>
<p>Lukhmidass Khimjee, without any serious impeachment of his accuracy, may easily
</p>
<p>have mistaken one of these small shrines for another ; or the plaintiff to serve a particular
</p>
<p>object, may have done an act which was not strictly regular.
</p>
<p>There is another objection to this whole story founded on the proposition that it
</p>
<p>is incredible in itself, as involving a violation not only of the most universally observed
</p>
<p>laws of decency, but of the very principles on which our common human nature is
</p>
<p>built up. This is a very inconclusive objection : it is not an objection likely to have
</p>
<p>any weight with those whom reading and experience have carried beyond the circle
</p>
<p>of home manners and home opinions. It is difficult for an Englishman of the 19th
</p>
<p>century to believe in the existence of such a state of manners as is depicted by Petronius
</p>
<p>or Martial, and yet we know that these two writers were the most fashionable and
</p>
<p>favorite authors among their Eoman contemporaries ; the very essence of their popularity
</p>
<p>consisting in the general truthfulness of their social portraitures. So in order to put
</p>
<p>ourselves in a position for judging adequately of the probable truth of such a story as
</p>
<p>this, we must endeavour to realise as best we can the state of feeling habitual among those
</p>
<p>whose corruptions it exposes. We must suppose the case of a weak and blinded people ; a
</p>
<p>rapacious and libidinous priesthood : a god whose most popular attributes are his feats of
</p>
<p>sexual prowess ; a paradise whose most attractive title is that of " a boundless ocean
</p>
<p>of amorous enjoyment." But there is one plain fact which on this matter is worth a
</p>
<p>world of speculation. So little did Lukmidass Khimjee suppose that there was any
</p>
<p>thing incredible in the story, that at a large party at Goculdass Tezpall's, he made it
</p>
<p>the subject of an attack half-jocose, half-earnest against his uncle, who has now for
</p>
<p>some years been absent in Zanzibar. He mentioned the names of several highly respect
</p>
<p>able members of his caste and sect in whose presence the alleged attack was
</p>
<p>made ; those witnesses were put into the box and tendered for cross-examination, but
</p>
<p>no question was put to them tending in any way to impugn the statement of Lukmi-
</p>
<p>dass Khimjee.
</p>
<p>Such is the evidence in support of the charges made against the moral character of
</p>
<p>the plaintiff in the plea of justification ; on my mind that evidence leaves not a
</p>
<p>shadow of doubt ; the charges made are, in my opinion, fully substantiated. Jaddunathjee
</p>
<p>Maharaj is conclusively shown to have been in no degree superior in morality to the

<p>average of his brethren, and principally to have differed from them in the tact and
</p>
<p>cunning with which he employed public professions of zeal for reform as a convenient
</p>
<p>cloak for uncleanliness.
</p>
<p>Having thus gone through all the observations I proposed to make on the evidence,
</p>
<p>there is only one other point on which I wish to say a few words.
</p>
<p>This trial has been spoken of as having involved a great waste of the public time
</p>
<p>[ cannot quite agree with that opinion. No doubt much time hae been spent in
</p>
<p>hearing this cause, but I would fain hope it has not been all time wasted. It seems
</p>
<p>impossible that this matter should have been discussed thus openly before a population

</p>
<p>BO intelligent as that of the natives of Western India, without producing its resuith.
</p>
<p>]t has probably taught some to think ; it must have led many to enquire. It is
</p>
<p>not a question of theology that has been before us ! it is a question of morality.
</p>
<p>The principle for which the defendant and his witnesses have been contending
</p>
<p>is simply this  that what is morally wrong cannot be theologically right  that
</p>
<p>when practices which sap the very foundations of morality, which involve
</p>
<p>a violation of the eternal and immutable laws of Eight,  are established in the name
</p>
<p>and imder the sanction of Religion, they ought, for the common welfare of Society, and
</p>
<p>in the interest of Humanity itself, to be publicly denounced and exposed. They have
</p>
<p>denounced  they have exposed them. At a risk and to a cost which we cannot adequate-
</p>
<p>ly measure, these men have done determined battle against a foul and powerful delu-
</p>
<p>sion. They have dared to look Custom and Error boldly in the face, and proclaim before
</p>
<p>the world of their votaries, that their Evil is not Good, that their Lie is not the Truth. In
</p>
<p>thus doing they have done bravely and well. It may be allowable to express a hope thai
</p>
<p>what they have done will not have been in vain  that the seed they have sown will bear
</p>
<p>its fruit  that their courage and consistency will be rewarded ^y a steady increase in
</p>
<p>the number of those, whom their words and their examples have quickened into thought
</p>
<p>and animated to resistance, whose homes they have helped to cleanse fiom loathsome
</p>
<p>lewdness, and whose souls they have set free from a debasing bondage.
