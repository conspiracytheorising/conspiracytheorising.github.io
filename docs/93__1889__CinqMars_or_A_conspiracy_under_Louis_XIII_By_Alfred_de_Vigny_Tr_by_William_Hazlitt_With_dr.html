<p>. . . behold,
</p>
<p>2 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>With this poetic movement he traverses time and
</p>
<p>space, and transports at will the attentive assembly to
</p>
<p>the theatre of his sublime scenes.
</p>
<p>We shall avail ourselves of the same privilege, though
</p>
<p>without the same genius. No more than he will we seat
</p>
<p>ourselves upon the tripod of the unities, but merely cast-
</p>
<p>ing our eyes upon Paris and the old dark palace of the
</p>
<p>Louvre, we will at once pass over the space of two hun-
</p>
<p>dred leagues and the period of two years.
</p>
<p>Two years ! what changes may they not have upon
</p>
<p>men, upon their families, and above all in that great
</p>
<p>and so troublous family of nations, whose long alliances
</p>
<p>a single day suffices to destroy, whose wars are ended
</p>
<p>by a birth, whose peace is broken by a death ! We
</p>
<p>ourselves have beheld kings returning to their dwell-
</p>
<p>ing on a spring day ; that same day a vessel sailed
</p>
<p>for a voyage of two years. The navigator returned.
</p>
<p>The kings were seated upon their thrones ; nothing
</p>
<p>seemed to have taken place in his absence, and yet
</p>
<p>God had deprived those kings of a hundred days of
</p>
<p>their reign.
</p>
<p>But nothing was changed for France in 1642, the
</p>
<p>epoch to which we turn, except her fears and her hopes.
</p>
<p>The future alone had changed its aspect. Before again
</p>
<p>beholding our personages, we must contemplate at large
</p>
<p>the state of the kingdom.
</p>
<p>The powerful unity of the monarchy was rendered
</p>
<p>still more imposing by the misfortunes of the neighbor-
</p>
<p>ing .States. The revolutions in England and those in
</p>
<p>Spain and Portugal rendered the calm which France

</p>
<p>overthrown or defeated, aggrandized the immovable
</p>
<p>Richelieu.
</p>
<p>Six formidable armies, reposing upon their triumph-
</p>
<p>ant weapons, served as a rampart to the kingdom.
</p>
<p>Those of the north, in league with Sweden, had put the
</p>
<p>Imperialists to flight, still pursued by the spirit of
</p>
<p>Gustavus Adolphus ; those on the frontiers of Italy had
</p>
<p>in Piedmont received the keys of the towns which had
</p>
<p>been defended by Prince Thomas ; and those which
</p>
<p>strengthened the chain of the Pyrenees held in check
</p>
<p>revolted Catalonia, and chafed before Perpignan, which
</p>
<p>they were not allowed to take. The interior was not
</p>
<p>happy, but tranquil. An invisible genius seemed to
</p>
<p>have maintained this calm, for the king, mortally sick,
</p>
<p>languished at St. Germain with a young favorite ; and
</p>
<p>the cardinal was, they said, dying at Narbonne. Some
</p>
<p>deaths, however, betrayed that he yet lived ; and at in-
</p>
<p>tervals, men falling as if struck by a poisonous blast
</p>
<p>recalled to mind the invisible power.
</p>
<p>Saint-Preuil, one of Richelieu's enemies, had just laid
</p>
<p>his iron head upon the scaffold without shame or fear,
</p>
<p>as he himself said on mounting it.
</p>
<p>Meantime France seemed to govern herself, for the
</p>
<p>prince and the minister had been separated a long time ;
</p>
<p>and of these two sick men, who mutually hated each
</p>
<p>other, one had never held the reins of the State, the
</p>
<p>other no longer showed his power, he was no longer
</p>
<p>named in the public acts ; he appeared no longer in the
</p>
<p>government, and seemed effaced everywhere; he slept,
</p>
<p>like the spider surrounded by his nets.

<p>If some events and some revolutions had taken place
</p>
<p>4 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>during these two years, it must have been in hearts ; it
</p>
<p>must have been some of those occult changes from
</p>
<p>which, in monarchies without firm foundation, terrible
</p>
<p>overthrows and long and bloody dissensions arise.
</p>
<p>To enlighten ourselves, let us glance at the old black
</p>
<p>building of the unfinished Louvre, and listen to the
</p>
<p>conversation of those who inhabited it and those who
</p>
<p>surrounded it.
</p>
<p>It was the month of December ; a rigorous winter had
</p>
<p>afflicted Paris, where the misery and inquietude of the
</p>
<p>people were extreme. However, curiosity was still alive,
</p>
<p>and they were eager for the spectacles given by the
</p>
<p>court. Their poverty weighed less heavily upon them
</p>
<p>while they contemplated the agitations of the rich.
</p>
<p>Their tears were less bitter on beholding the struggles
</p>
<p>of power ; and the blood of the nobles which flowed in
</p>
<p>their streets, and seemed the only blood worthy of being
</p>
<p>shed, made them bless their obscurity. Already had tu-
</p>
<p>multuous scenes and conspicuous assassinations proved
</p>
<p>the monarch's weakness, the absence and approaching
</p>
<p>end of the minister, and as a kind of prologue to the
</p>
<p>bloody comedy of the Fronde, sharpened the malice and
</p>
<p>even fired the passions of the Parisians. This confusion
</p>
<p>was not displeasing to them. Indifferent to the causes
</p>
<p>of the quarrels which were abstruse for them, they were
</p>
<p>not so with regard to individuals, and already began to
</p>
<p>regard the party chiefs with affection or hatred, not on
</p>
<p>account of the interest which they supposed them to
</p>
<p>take in the welfare of their class, but simply because
</p>
<p>as actors they pleased or displeased.

</p>
<p>One night especially, pistol and gun shots had been
</p>
<p>THE EMEUTE. 5
</p>
<p>heard frequently in the city ; the numerous patrols of
</p>
<p>the Swiss and the body-guards had even been attacked,
</p>
<p>and had met with some barricades in the tortuous
</p>
<p>streets of the Isle Notre-Dame ; carts chained to the
</p>
<p>posts, and laden with barrels, prevented the cavaliers
</p>
<p>from advancing, and some musket-shots had wounded
</p>
<p>several men and horses. However, the town still slept,
</p>
<p>except the quarter which surrounded the Louvre, which
</p>
<p>was at this time inhabited by the queen and M. le Due
</p>
<p>d'Orleans. There everything announced a nocturnal
</p>
<p>expedition of a very serious nature.
</p>
<p>It was two o'clock in the morning- It was freezing,
</p>
<p>and the darkness was intense, when a numerous as-
</p>
<p>semblage stopped upon the quay, which was then hardly
</p>
<p>paved, and slowly and by degrees occupied the sandy
</p>
<p>ground which sloped down to the Seine. This troop
</p>
<p>was composed of about two hundred men ; they were
</p>
<p>wrapped in large cloaks, raised by the long Spanish
</p>
<p>swords which they wore. Walking, without preserving
</p>
<p>any order, backwards and forwards, they seemed to wait
</p>
<p>for events rather than to seek them. Many of them
</p>
<p>seated themselves, with their arms folded, upon the
</p>
<p>loose stones of the newly commenced parapet ; they
</p>
<p>preserved entire silence. However, after a few minutes
</p>
<p>passed in this manner, a man, who appeared to come
</p>
<p>out at one of the vaulted doors of the Louvre, ap-
</p>
<p>proached slowly, holding a dark lantern, the light from
</p>
<p>which he turned upon the features of each individual,
</p>
<p>and which he blew out after having found the man he
</p>
<p>sought among them. He spoke to him in a whisper,

</p>
<p>taking him by the hand,
</p>
<p>6 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" Well, Olivier, what did M. le Grand say to you ? l
</p>
<p>Does all go on well ? "
</p>
<p>" Yes, yes, I saw him yesterday at St. Germain. The
</p>
<p>old cat is very ill at Narbonne ; he is going ad patres.
</p>
<p>But we must manage our affairs roundly, for it is not
</p>
<p>the first time that he has played the torpid. Have you
</p>
<p>people enough for this evening, my dear Fontrailles ? "
</p>
<p>" Be easy ; Montre'sor is coining with an hundred of
</p>
<p>Monsieur's gentlemen. You will recognize him ; he will
</p>
<p>be disguised as a master-mason, with a rule in his hand.
</p>
<p>But above all, do not forget the passwords. Do you
</p>
<p>know them all well, you and your friends?"
</p>
<p>" Yes, all except the Abb6 de Gondi, who has not yet
</p>
<p>arrived ; but Dieu me pardonne, I think he is there him-
</p>
<p>self ! Who the devil would have known him ? "
</p>
<p>And here a little man without a cassock, dressed as
</p>
<p>a soldier of the French guards, and wearing very black
</p>
<p>false mustaches, slipped between them. He danced
</p>
<p>about with a joyous air, and rubbed his hands.
</p>
<p>" Vive Dieu ! all goes on well, my friend. Fiesco could
</p>
<p>not do better ; " and rising upon his toes to tap Olivier
</p>
<p>upon the shoulder, he continued,
</p>
<p>" Do you know that for a man who has just quitted
</p>
<p>the rank of pages, you don't manage badly, Sire Olivier
</p>
<p>d'Entraigues ; and you will be among our illustrious
</p>
<p>men if we find a Plutarch. All is well organized ; you
</p>
<p>arrive at the very moment, neither too soon nor too late,
</p>
<p>like a true party chief. Fontrailles, this young man will
</p>
<p>get on, I prophesy. But we must make haste ; in two
</p>

<p>THE EMEUTE. 1
</p>
<p>hours we shall have some of the archbishops of Paris,
</p>
<p>my uncle's parishioners. I have lessoned them well ;
</p>
<p>and they will cry, ' Vive Monsieur ! vive la Regente ! et
</p>
<p>plus de Cardinal ! ' like madmen. They are good devo-
</p>
<p>tees, thanks to me, who have stirred them up. The king
</p>
<p>is very bad. Oh, all goes well, very well ! I come from
</p>
<p>St. Germain. I have seen our friend Cinq-Mars ; he is
</p>
<p>good, very good, still firm as a rock. Ah, that is what
</p>
<p>I call a man ! How he has played with them with his
</p>
<p>melancholy and careless air ! He is the master of the
</p>
<p>court at present. The king, they say, is going to make
</p>
<p>him due and peer. It is much talked of ; but he still
</p>
<p>hesitates. We must decide that by our movement this
</p>
<p>evening. The will of the people ! He must do the will
</p>
<p>of the people ; we will make him hear it. It will be the
</p>
<p>death of Richelieu, you '11 see. It is, above all, hatred to
</p>
<p>him which is to predominate in the cries, for that is the
</p>
<p>essential thing. That will at last decide our Gaston,
</p>
<p>who is still uncertain, is he not ? "
</p>
<p>" And how can he be anything else ? " said Fon-
</p>
<p>trailles. " If he were to take a resolution to-day in
</p>
<p>our favor, it would be unfortunate."
</p>
<p>"Why so?"
</p>
<p>" Because we should be sure that to-morrow morning-
</p>
<p>he would be against us."
</p>
<p>" Never mind," replied the abbe ; " the queen is firm."
</p>
<p>" And she has heart also," said Olivier ; " that gives
</p>
<p>me some hope for Cinq-Mars, who, it seems to me, has
</p>
<p>sometimes dared to frown when he looked at her."
</p>

</p>
<p>her heart beats, it is for the past and not for the future.
</p>
<p>But these trifles are not to the purpose. Tell me, mon
</p>
<p>cher, are you sure of your young advocate whom I see
</p>
<p>roaming about there ? Is he all right ? "
</p>
<p>" Perfectly ; he is an excellent Royalist. He would
</p>
<p>throw the cardinal into the river in an instant. Besides,
</p>
<p>it is Fournier of Loudun ; that is saying everything."
</p>
<p>" Well, well, these are the men we like. But take
</p>
<p>care of yourselves, Messieurs ; some one comes from the
</p>
<p>Rue St. Honore."
</p>
<p>" Who goes there ? " cried the foremost of the troop
</p>
<p>to some men who were advancing. " Royalists or
</p>
<p>Cardinalists ? "
</p>
<p>" Gaston and Le Grand," replied the new-comers, in a
</p>
<p>low voice.
</p>
<p>" It is Montresor and Monsieur's people," said Fon-
</p>
<p>trailles. " We may soon commence."
</p>
<p>"Yes, par la corbleu!" said the new-comer, "for the
</p>
<p>Cardinalists will pass at three o'clock. We were told
</p>
<p>so just now."
</p>
<p>"Where are they going?" said Fontrailles.
</p>
<p>" There are more than two hundred of them to escort
</p>
<p>M. de Chavigny, who is going to see the old cat at
</p>
<p>Narbonne, they say. They thought it safer to pass by
</p>
<p>the Louvre."
</p>
<p>" Well, we will give him a velvet paw ! " said the
</p>
<p>abbe".
</p>
<p>As he finished saying this, a noise of carriages and
</p>
<p>horses was heard. Several men in cloaks rolled an

<p>enormous stone into the middle of the street. The fore-

<p>THE EMEUTE. 9
</p>
<p>most cavaliers passed rapidly through the crowd, pistol
</p>
<p>in hand, suspecting that something was going on ; but
</p>
<p>the postilion, who drove the horses of the first carriage,
</p>
<p>ran upon the stone and fell.
</p>
<p>" Whose carriage is this which thus crushes foot-
</p>
<p>passengers ? " cried the cloakmen, all at once. " It is
</p>
<p>tyrannical. It can be no other but a friend of the Car-
</p>
<p>dinal de la Roclielle." l
</p>
<p>" It is one who does not fear the friends of the little
</p>
<p>Le Grand," exclaimed a voice from the open door, from
</p>
<p>which a man threw himself upon a horse.
</p>
<p>" Drive these Cardinalists into the river ! " cried a
</p>
<p>shrill, piercing voice.
</p>
<p>This was a signal for the pistol-shots which were
</p>
<p>furiously exchanged on every side, and which lighted
</p>
<p>up this tumultuous and sombre scene. The clashing of
</p>
<p>swords and trampling of horses did not prevent the
</p>
<p>cries from being heard on one side : " Down with the
</p>
<p>minister ! Long live the king ! Long live Monsieur and
</p>
<p>M. le Grand ! Down with the red-stockings ! " on the
</p>
<p>other : " Long live his Eminence ! Long live the great
</p>
<p>cardinal ! Death to the factious ! Long live the king ! "
</p>
<p>For the name of the king presided over every hatred, as
</p>
<p>over every affection, at this strange time.
</p>
<p>The men on foot had however succeeded in placing
</p>
<p>the two carriages across the quay so as to make a ram-
</p>
<p>part against Chavigny's horses, and from this, between
</p>
<p>the wheels, through the doors and springs, overwhelmed

</p>
<p>them with pistol-shots, and dismounted many. The
</p>
<p>tumult was frightful, when the gates of the Louvre were
</p>
<p>all at once thrown open, and two squadrons of the body-
</p>
<p>guard came out at a trot. Most of them carried torches
</p>
<p>in their hands to light themselves and those they were
</p>
<p>to attack. The scene changed. As the guards reached
</p>
<p>each of the men on foot, the latter was seen to stop,
</p>
<p>remove his hat, make himself known, and name himself;
</p>
<p>and the guards withdrew, sometimes saluting him, and
</p>
<p>sometimes shaking him by the hand. This succor to
</p>
<p>Chavigny's carriages was then nearly useless, and only
</p>
<p>served to augment the confusion. The body-guards, as
</p>
<p>if *to satisfy their consciences, rushed through the crowd
</p>
<p>of duellists, saying,
</p>
<p>" Now, Messieurs, be moderate."
</p>
<p>But when two gentlemen had decidedly crossed
</p>
<p>swords, and were warmly engaged with each other,
</p>
<p>the guard who beheld them stopped to judge the fight,
</p>
<p>and sometimes even to favor the one who he thought
</p>
<p>O
</p>
<p>was of his opinion, for this body, like all France, had
</p>
<p>their Royalists and their Cardinalists.
</p>
<p>The windows of the Louvre were one by one lighted
</p>
<p>up, and many women's heads were seen behind the little
</p>
<p>lozenge-shaped panes, attentively watching the combat.
</p>
<p>Numerous Swiss patrols came out with flambeaux.
</p>
<p>These soldiers were easily distinguished by their singu-
</p>
<p>lar uniform. Their right sleeve was striped blue and
</p>
<p>red, and the silk stocking of their right leg was red ;
</p>
<p>the left side striped with blue, red, and white, and
</p>
<p>the stocking white and red. It had no doubt been

</p>
<p>hoped in the royal chateau that this foreign troop would
</p>
<p>THE EMEUTE. 11
</p>
<p>disperse the assembly, but they were mistaken. These
</p>
<p>impassible soldiers coldly and exactly executed, without
</p>
<p>going beyond, the orders they had received, circulating
</p>
<p>symmetrically between the armed groups, which they
</p>
<p>divided for a moment, returning before the gate with
</p>
<p>perfect precision, and resuming their ranks as on pa-
</p>
<p>rade, without informing themselves whether the enemies
</p>
<p>between whom they had passed had rejoined or not.
</p>
<p>But the noise, for a moment appeased, became general
</p>
<p>by dint of personal disputes. In every direction chal-
</p>
<p>lenges, insults, and imprecations were heard. It seemed
</p>
<p>as if nothing but the destruction of one of the two
</p>
<p>parties could put an end to the combat, when loud
</p>
<p>cries, or rather frightful howls, raised the tumult to
</p>
<p>its highest pitch. The Abbe de Gondi, then employed
</p>
<p>in dragging a cavalier by his cloak to pull him down,
</p>
<p>exclaimed,
</p>
<p>" Here are my people ! Fontrailles, now you will
</p>
<p>have something worth seeing ! Look ! look already how
</p>
<p>they come on ! It is really charming."
</p>
<p>And he left his hold, and mounted upon a stone to
</p>
<p>contemplate the manoeuvres of his troops, crossing his
</p>
<p>arms with the importance of a general of an army. The
</p>
<p>day was beginning to break, and from the end of the
</p>
<p>Isle St. Louis a crowd of men, women, and children
</p>
<p>of the lowest dregs of the people were seen rapidly
</p>
<p>advancing, casting towards heaven and the Louvre
</p>
<p>strange vociferations. Girls carried long swords ; chil-
</p>
<p>dren dragged immense halberds and pikes of the time of
</p>
<p>the League ; old women in rags dragged after them by

<p>cords carts full of rusty and broken arms ; workmen of

</p>
<p>every trade, the most of them drunk, followed, armed
</p>
<p>with clubs, forks, lances, shovels, torches, stakes, crooks,
</p>
<p>levers, sabres, and spits. They sang and howled by
</p>
<p>turns, counterfeiting with atrocious yells the cries of a
</p>
<p>cat, and carrying for a flag one of these animals sus-
</p>
<p>pended from a pole and wrapped in a red rag, thus
</p>
<p>representing the cardinal, whose taste for cats was
</p>
<p>generally known. Public criers rushed about, all red
</p>
<p>and breathless, throwing on the pavement and sticking
</p>
<p>on the parapets, the posts, the walls of the houses, and
</p>
<p>even on the palace, long satires in short verse, made upon
</p>
<p>the personages of the time. Butcher boys and scullions,
</p>
<p>carrying large cutlasses, beat the charge upon sauce-
</p>
<p>pans, and dragged in the mud a newly slaughtered pig,
</p>
<p>witli the red cap of a chorister on its head. Young
</p>
<p>and vigorous men, dressed as women, and painted with
</p>
<p>a coarse vermilion, were yelling at the pitch of their
</p>
<p>voices, " We are mothers of families ruined by Riche-
</p>
<p>lieu ! Death to the cardinal ! " They carried in their
</p>
<p>arms straw children, which they threw into the river.
</p>
<p>When this disgusting mob had overrun the quays with
</p>
<p>its thousands of imps, it produced a strange effect upon
</p>
<p>the combatants, and entirely contrary to that expected
</p>
<p>by their patron. The enemies on both sides lowered
</p>
<p>their arms and separated. Those of Monsieur and of
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars were revolted at seeing themselves succored
</p>
<p>by such auxiliaries, and themselves aiding the cardi-
</p>
<p>nal's gentlemen to remount their horses and to gain
</p>
<p>their carriages, and their valets to convey the wounded
</p>
<p>to them, gave their adversaries personal rendezvous to

</p>
<p>more worthy of them. Reddening at the superiority of
</p>
<p>numbers and the ignoble troops which they seemed to
</p>
<p>command, foreseeing, perhaps, for the first time the
</p>
<p>fearful consequences of their political machinations, and
</p>
<p>what was the scum they were stirring up, they withdrew,
</p>
<p>slouching their large hats over their eyes, throwing their
</p>
<p>cloaks over their shoulders, and dreading the daylight.
</p>
<p>"You have spoiled all, my dear abbe", with this mob,"
</p>
<p>said Fontrailles, stamping his foot, to Gondi, who was
</p>
<p>already sufficiently confounded ; " your good man of an
</p>
<p>uncle has fine parishioners."
</p>
<p>" It is not my fault," replied Gondi, in a sullen tone ;
</p>
<p>" these idiots came an hour too late. If they had arrived
</p>
<p>in the night, they would not have been seen, which spoils
</p>
<p>the effect somewhat, to speak the truth (for I admit that
</p>
<p>the daylight is detrimental to them), and we should
</p>
<p>only have heard the voice of the people : Vox populi, vox
</p>
<p>Dei. Nevertheless, there is not so much harm done.
</p>
<p>They will by their multitude give us the means of escap-
</p>
<p>ing without being known, and, after all, our task is
</p>
<p>ended ; we did not wish the death of the sinner. Cha-
</p>
<p>vigny and his men are worthy fellows, whom I love ; if
</p>
<p>he is only slightly wounded, so much the better. Adieu ;
</p>
<p>I am going to see M. de Bouillon, who has arrived from
</p>
<p>Italy."
</p>
<p>" Olivier," said Fontrailles, " proceed to St. Germain
</p>
<p>with Fournier and Ambrosio ; I will go and give an ac-
</p>
<p>count to Monsieur, with Montre*sor."
</p>
<p>All separated, and disgust did, with these high-born
</p>
<p>men, what force could not do.

</p>
<p>great misfortunes. No one was killed in it. The cava-
</p>
<p>liers, having gained a few scratches and lost a few
</p>
<p>purses, resumed their route by the side of the carriages
</p>
<p>along the by-streets ; the others escaped, one by one,
</p>
<p>through the populace they had raised up. The miser-
</p>
<p>able wretches who composed it, deprived of the chief of
</p>
<p>the troops, still remained two hours, yelling and scream-
</p>
<p>ing until the effects of their wine was gone, and the cold
</p>
<p>had extinguished at once the fire of their blood and that
</p>
<p>of their enthusiasm. At the windows of the houses, on
</p>
<p>the quay of the city, and along the walls, the wise and
</p>
<p>genuine people of Paris watched with a sorrowful air
</p>
<p>and in mournful silence these preludes of disorder ;
</p>
<p>while the various bodies of merchants, dressed in black
</p>
<p>and preceded by their provosts, walked slowly and cour-
</p>
<p>ageously through the populace towards the Palais de
</p>
<p>Justice, where the parliament was to assemble, to com-
</p>
<p>plain to it of these terrible nocturnal scenes.
</p>
<p>The apartments of Gaston d'Orle'ans were in a great
</p>
<p>confusion. This prince then occupied the wing of the
</p>
<p>Louvre parallel with the Tuileries ; and his windows
</p>
<p>looked into the court on one side, and on the other, over
</p>
<p>a mass of little houses and narrow streets which almost
</p>
<p>entirely covered the place. He had risen precipitately,
</p>
<p>awakened suddenly by the report of the fire-arms, had
</p>
<p>thrust his feet into large square-toed slippers with high
</p>
<p>heels, and, wrapped in a large silk dressing-gown,
</p>
<p>covered with golden ornaments embroidered in relief,
</p>
<p>walked backwards and forwards in his bedroom, send-
</p>
<p>ing every minute a fresh lackey to see what was going

<p>on, and ordering them immediately to go for the Abbe*
</p>
<p>THE EMEUTE. 15
</p>
<p>de la Riviere, his general counsellor ; but he was un-
</p>
<p>fortunately out of Paris. At every pistol-shot this timid
</p>
<p>prince rushed to the windows, without seeing anything
</p>
<p>but some flambeaux, which were carried quickly along.
</p>
<p>It was in vain that he was told that the cries he heard
</p>
<p>were in his favor ; he did not cease to walk up and
</p>
<p>down the apartments, in the greatest disorder, his long
</p>
<p>black hair dishevelled, and his blue eyes open and en-
</p>
<p>larged by disquiet and terror. He was still thus when
</p>
<p>Montre"sor and Fontrailles at length arrived and found
</p>
<p>him beating his breast, and repeating a thousand times,
</p>
<p>" Me& culpa, meft culpa ! "
</p>
<p>" Come ! come ! " he exclaimed from a distance, run-
</p>
<p>ning to meet them. " Come ! quick ! What is going on ?
</p>
<p>What are they doing there ? Who are these assassins ?
</p>
<p>What are these cries ? "
</p>
<p>" They cry, ' Long live Monsieur ! ' "
</p>
<p>Gaston, without appearing to hear, and holding the
</p>
<p>door of his chamber open for an instant, that his voice
</p>
<p>might reach the galleries in which were the people of his
</p>
<p>household, continued to cry with all his strength, and
</p>
<p>gesticulating violently,
</p>
<p>" I know nothing of all this, and I have authorized
</p>
<p>nothing. I will not hear anything ! I will not know
</p>
<p>anything ! I will never enter into any project ! These
</p>
<p>are rioters who make all this noise ; do not speak to
</p>
<p>me of them, if you wish to be well received here. I am
</p>
<p>the enemy of no man ; I detest such scenes ! ".
</p>
<p>Fontrailles, who knew the man with whom he had to
</p>
<p>deal, said nothing, but entered with his friend, that

<p>Monsieur might have time to discharge his first fury ;
</p>
<p>16 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>and when all was said, and the door carefully shut, he
</p>
<p>began to speak,
</p>
<p>" Monseigneur," said he, " we come to ask you a thou-
</p>
<p>sand pardons for the impertinence of these people, who
</p>
<p>will persist in crying out that they desire the death of
</p>
<p>your enemy, and that they would even wish to make you
</p>
<p>regent if we had the misfortune to lose his Majesty.
</p>
<p>Yes, the people are always frank in their discourse ; but
</p>
<p>they were so numerous that all our efforts could not
</p>
<p>restrain them. It was truly a cry from the heart, an
</p>
<p>explosion of love, which reason could not restrain, and
</p>
<p>which escaped all bounds."
</p>
<p>" But what has passed, then ? " interrupted Gaston,
</p>
<p>somewhat calmed. " What have they been doing these
</p>
<p>four hours that I have heard them?"
</p>
<p>" That love," said Montre'sor, coldly, " as M. de Fon-
</p>
<p>trailles had the honor of telling you, so escaped all rule
</p>
<p>and bounds, that we ourselves were carried away by
</p>
<p>it, and felt seized with that enthusiasm which always
</p>
<p>transports us at the mere name of Monsieur, and which
</p>
<p>leads us on to things which we had not premeditated."
</p>
<p>" But what, then, have you done ? " said the prince.
</p>
<p>" Those things," replied Fontrailles, " of which M. de
</p>
<p>Montre'sor had the honor to speak to Monsieur are pre-
</p>
<p>cisely those which I foresaw here yesterday evening,
</p>
<p>when I had the honor of conversing with you."
</p>
<p>"That is not the question," interrupted Gaston.
</p>
<p>" You cannot say that I have ordered or authorized any-
</p>
<p>thing. I meddle with nothing; I know nothing of
</p>
<p>government."

</p>
<p>" I admit," continued Fontrailles, " that your Highness
</p>
<p>THE EMEUTE. 17
</p>
<p>commanded nothing, but you permitted me to tell you
</p>
<p>that I foresaw that this night would be a troubled one
</p>
<p>about two o'clock, and I hoped that your astonishment
</p>
<p>would not have been so great."
</p>
<p>The prince, recovering himself little by little, and
</p>
<p>seeing that he did not alarm the two champions, having
</p>
<p>also upon his conscience and reading in their eyes the
</p>
<p>recollection of the consent which he had given them the
</p>
<p>evening before, sat down upon the side of his bed,
</p>
<p>crossed his arms, and looking at them with the air of a
</p>
<p>judge, again said in a commanding tone,
</p>
<p>" But what, then, have you done ? "
</p>
<p>" Why, scarce anything, Monseigneur," said Fon-
</p>
<p>trailles. " Chance led us to meet in the crowd some of
</p>
<p>our friends who had a quarrel with M. de Chavigny's
</p>
<p>coachman, who was driving over them. A few ani-
</p>
<p>mated words ensued and rough gestures, and a few
</p>
<p>scratches, which kept M. de Chavigny waiting, and
</p>
<p>that's all."
</p>
<p>" Absolutely all," repeated Montr^sor.
</p>
<p>" How, all ? " exclaimed Gaston, much moved, and
</p>
<p>stamping about the chamber. " And is it, then, nothing
</p>
<p>to stop the carriage of a friend of the cardinal-due ? I
</p>
<p>do not like such scenes. I have already told you so. I
</p>
<p>do not hate the cardinal ; he is certainly a great politi-
</p>
<p>cian, a very great politician. You have compromised
</p>
<p>me horribly ; it is known that Montresor is with me.
</p>
<p>If he has been recognized, they will say that I sent
</p>
<p>him."
</p>

<p>cloak, and which, for that reason, I preferred to any
</p>
<p>other."
</p>
<p>Gaston breathed again.
</p>
<p>" You are sure, then, that you have not been recog-
</p>
<p>nized. You understand, my dear friend, how painful it
</p>
<p>would be to me. You must admit yourself
</p>
<p>" Sure of it ! " exclaimed the prince's gentleman. " I
</p>
<p>would stake my head and my share in paradise that no
</p>
<p>one has seen my features or called me by my name."
</p>
<p>" Well," continued Gaston, again seating himself on
</p>
<p>his bed, and assuming a calmer air, in which even a
</p>
<p>slight satisfaction was visible, " tell me, then, what has
</p>
<p>passed."
</p>
<p>Fontrailles took upon himself the recital, in which,
</p>
<p>as we may suppose, the populace played a great part
</p>
<p>and Monsieur's people none, and in his peroration he
</p>
<p>said,
</p>
<p>" From our windows even, Monseigneur, respectable
</p>
<p>mothers of families might have been seen, driven by
</p>
<p>despair, throwing their children into the Seine, cursing
</p>
<p>Richelieu."
</p>
<p>" Ah, 't is dreadful ! " exclaimed the prince, indignant,
</p>
<p>or feigning to be so, and to believe in these excesses.
</p>
<p>" Is it, then, true that he is so generally detested ? But
</p>
<p>we must allow that he deserves it. What ! his ambition
</p>
<p>and avarice have, then, reduced to this extremity the
</p>
<p>good inhabitants of Paris, whom I love so much."
</p>
<p>" Yes, Monseigneur," replied the orator. " And here
</p>
<p>it is not Paris alone, it is entire France, which, with us,
</p>
<p>entreats you to decide upon delivering her from this

</p>
<p>from your august head to annihilate this pygmy, who
</p>
<p>has attempted to assault the royal house itself."
</p>
<p>" Alas ! Heaven is my witness that I myself forgive
</p>
<p>him ! " answered Gaston, raising up his eyes. " But I
</p>
<p>can no longer bear the cries of the people. Yes, I will
</p>
<p>go to their help; that is to say," continued the prince,
</p>
<p>" so that my dignity is not compromised, and that my
</p>
<p>name is not seen at all in the matter."
</p>
<p>" Well, but it is precisely that we want," exclaimed
</p>
<p>Fontrailles, a little more at his ease.
</p>
<p>" See, Monseigneur, there are already some names to r
</p>
<p>put after yours, who will not fear to sign. I will tell
</p>
<p>you them immediately, if you wish it."
</p>
<p>" But but," said the Due d'Orle'ans, fearfully, " do
</p>
<p>you know that it is a conspiracy that you propose to me
</p>
<p>so simply ? "
</p>
<p>" Fie, Monseigneur, men of honor like us ! a conspir-
</p>
<p>acy ! Oh ! not at all ; a league at the utmost, a slight
</p>
<p>combination to give a direction to the unanimous wish
</p>
<p>of the nation and the court, that 's all."
</p>
<p>" But that is not so clear, for after all this affair will
</p>
<p>be neither general nor public ; therefore it is a conspir-
</p>
<p>acy. You will not avow that you are concerned in it."
</p>
<p>" I, Monseigneur ! Excuse me to all the world, since
</p>
<p>the kingdom is already in it, and I am of the kingdom.
</p>
<p>And who would not sign his name after that of MM. de
</p>
<p>Bouillon and Cinq-Mars ? "
</p>
<p>" After, perhaps, not before," said Gaston, fixing
</p>
<p>his eyes upon Fontrailles more keenly than he had
</p>
<p>expected.

<p>The latter hesitated a moment.

</p>
<p>" Well, then, what would Monseigneur do if I told
</p>
<p>him the names after which he could sign his ? "
</p>
<p>" Ah, ah ! this is amusing," answered the prince,
</p>
<p>laughing ; " know you not that above mine there are not
</p>
<p>many ? I see but one."
</p>
<p>"And if there be one, will Monseigneur promise to
</p>
<p>sign that of Gaston beneath it ? "
</p>
<p>"Ah, parbleu! with all my heart. I risk nothing
</p>
<p>there, for I see none but the king, who surely is not of
</p>
<p>the party."
</p>
<p>" Well, from this moment permit us," said Montre'sor,
</p>
<p>" to take you at your word, and deign at present to con-
</p>
<p>sent to two things only, to see M. de Bouillon in the
</p>
<p>queen's apartments, and Monsieur the master of the
</p>
<p>horse at the king's palace."
</p>
<p>" Agreed ! " said Monsieur, gayly tapping Montre'sor
</p>
<p>on the shoulder. " I will to-day wait on my sister-in-law
</p>
<p>at her toilet, and I will invite my brother to hunt the
</p>
<p>stag with me at Chambord."
</p>
<p>The two friends asked nothing further, and were
</p>
<p>themselves surprised at their work. They had never
</p>
<p>seen so much resolution in their chief. Accordingly,
</p>
<p>fearing to lead him to a topic which might divert him
</p>
<p>from the path he had adopted, they hastened to turn

<p>the conversation upon other subjects, and retired in

<p>delight, leaving as their last words in his ear that they

</p>
<p>WHILE a prince was thus reassured with difficulty by
</p>
<p>those who surrounded him, and manifested to them a
</p>
<p>terror which might have proved contagious, a princess
</p>
<p>more exposed to accidents, more isolated by the indif-
</p>
<p>ference of her husband, weakened by nature and by the
</p>
<p>timidity which is the result of the absence of happiness,
</p>
<p>on her side set the example of the calmest courage
</p>
<p>and the most pious resignation, and tranquillized her
</p>
<p>terrified suite ; it was the queen. Having hardly slept
</p>
<p>an hour, she heard shrill cries behind the doors and the
</p>
<p>thick tapestries of her chamber. She ordered her
</p>
<p>women to open the door, and the Duchesse de Chevreuse,
</p>
<p>en chemise, and wrapped in a great cloak, fell, nearly
</p>
<p>fainting, at the foot of her bed, followed by four of her

<p>ladies-in-waiting, and three of the women of the bed-

</p>
<p>chamber. Her delicate feet were bare, and bleeding
</p>
<p>from a wound she had received in running. She cried,
</p>
<p>weeping like a child, that a pistol-shot had broken her
</p>
<p>shutters and her window-panes, and had wounded her ;
</p>
<p>that she entreated the queen to send her into exile,
</p>
<p>where she would be more tranquil than in a country
</p>
<p>where they wanted to assassinate her because she was
</p>
<p>the friend of her Majesty.
</p>
<p>Her hair was in great disorder, and fell to her feet.
</p>
<p>It was her principal beauty ; and the young queen
</p>
<p>thought that this toilet was less the result of chance
</p>
<p>than might have been imagined.
</p>
<p>" Well, ma chere ! what has happened ? " she said to
</p>
<p>her with sang-froid. " You look like a Magdalen, but
</p>
<p>in her youth, and before she repented. It is probable
</p>
<p>that if they wish to harm any one here it is me ; tran-
</p>
<p>quillize yourself."
</p>
<p>" No, Madame ! save me, protect me ! it is this Riche-
</p>
<p>lieu who pursues me, I am sure ! "
</p>
<p>The sound of pistols, which was then heard more dis-
</p>
<p>tinctly, convinced the queen that the terrors of Madame
</p>
<p>de Chevreuse were not vain.
</p>
<p>" Come and dress me, Madame de Motteville ! " cried
</p>
<p>she. But this lady had completely lost her self-posses-
</p>
<p>sion, and opening one of those immense ebony coffers
</p>
<p>which then answered the purpose of wardrobes, took
</p>
<p>from it a casket of the princess's diamonds to save it,
</p>
<p>and did not listen to her. The other women had seen
</p>
<p>on a window the reflection of the torches, and imagining
</p>
<p>that the palace was on fire, threw jewels, laces, golden

<p>vases, and even the china, into sheets which they in-
</p>

</p>
<p>tended to lower into the street. At this moment Ma-
</p>
<p>dame de Gue'mene arrived, a little more dressed than the
</p>
<p>Duchesse de Ohevreuse, but taking the thing still more
</p>
<p>tragically. Her terror inspired the queen with a slight
</p>
<p>degree of fear, because of the ceremonious and tranquil
</p>
<p>character she was known to possess. She entered
</p>
<p>without courtesying, pale as a spectre, and said with
</p>
<p>volubility,
</p>
<p>" Madame, it is time to make our confession. The
</p>
<p>Louvre is attacked, and all the populace are arriving
</p>
<p>from the city, I have been told."
</p>
<p>Terror silenced and rendered motionless all the per-
</p>
<p>sons present.
</p>
<p>" We shall die ! " exclaimed the Duchesse de Chev-
</p>
<p>reuse, still on her knees. " Ah, mon Dieu ! why did I
</p>
<p>leave England ? Yes, let us confess. I confess aloud.
</p>
<p>I have loved I have been loved by "
</p>
<p>" Well, well," said the queen, " I do not undertake to
</p>
<p>hear it to the end. That would not perhaps be the
</p>
<p>least of my dangers, of which, however, you think
</p>
<p>little."
</p>
<p>The sang-froid of Anne of Austria, and this last se-
</p>
<p>vere observation, however, restored a little calm to this
</p>
<p>beautiful personage, who rose in confusion, and perceiv-
</p>
<p>ing the disordered state of her toilet, went to repair it
</p>
<p>as she best could in a contiguous closet.
</p>
<p>" Dona Stefania," said the queen to one of her women,
</p>
<p>the only Spaniard whom she had retained with her, " go
</p>
<p>seek the captain of the guards. It is time that I should
</p>
<p>see men at last, and hear something reasonable."

<p>She said this in Spanish, and the mystery of this
</p>

</p>
<p>order given in a language which the ladies did not
</p>
<p>understand, restored those in the chamber to their
</p>
<p>senses.
</p>
<p>The waiting-woman was telling her beads, but she
</p>
<p>rose from the corner of the alcove in which she had
</p>
<p>sought refuge, and hastened to obey her mistress.
</p>
<p>The signs of the revolt and the symptoms of terror
</p>
<p>became meantime more distinct. In the great court of
</p>
<p>the Louvre was heard the trampling of the horses of
</p>
<p>the guards, the orders of the chiefs, the rolling of the
</p>
<p>queen's carriages, which were being prepared, should it
</p>
<p>be necessary to fly. The rattling of the iron chains
</p>
<p>dragged along the pavement to form barricades in case
</p>
<p>of an attack, hurried steps in the corridor, the clashing
</p>
<p>of arms, the confused cries of the people, which rose
</p>
<p>and fell, went and came again, like the noise of the
</p>
<p>waves and the winds. The door once more opened, and
</p>
<p>this time it was to admit a very charming personage.
</p>
<p>" I expected you, dear Marie," said the queen, extend-
</p>
<p>ing her arms to the Duchesse de Mantua. " You have
</p>
<p>been more courageous than any of us ; you are attired
</p>
<p>fit to be seen by all the court."
</p>
<p>" I was not in bed, fortunately," replied the young
</p>
<p>Princesse Gonzaga, casting down her eyes. " I saw all
</p>
<p>these people from the windows. Oh, Madame, Ma-
</p>
<p>dame, fly ! I beseech you to escape by the secret stairs,
</p>
<p>and to let us remain in your place. They might take
</p>
<p>one of us for the queen." And she added, with tears,
</p>
<p>" I have heard cries of death. Ply, Madame ! I have
</p>
<p>no throne to lose. You are the daughter, the wife, and

<p>mother of kings. Save yourself, and leave us here ! "
</p>
<p>THE ALCOVE. 25
</p>
<p>" You have more to lose than I have, mon amie, in
</p>
<p>beauty, youth, and, I hope, in happiness," said the queen,
</p>
<p>with a gracious smile, giving her her beautiful hands to
</p>
<p>kiss. " Remain in my alcove and welcome ; but we will
</p>
<p>both remain there. The only service I accept from
</p>
<p>you, belle enfant, is to bring me here to my bed that
</p>
<p>little golden casket which my poor Motteville has left on
</p>
<p>the ground, and which contains all that I have most
</p>
<p>precious."
</p>
<p>Then, in taking it, she added in Marie's ear,
</p>
<p>" If any misfortune should happen to me, swear that
</p>
<p>you will throw it into the Seine."
</p>
<p>" I will obey you, Madame, as my benefactress and
</p>
<p>my second mother," she answered, weeping.
</p>
<p>The noise of the combat redoubled on the quays, and
</p>
<p>the chamber windows often reflected the flashes of the
</p>
<p>fire-arms, of which they heard the explosion. The cap-
</p>
<p>tain of the guards and the captain of the Swiss sent for
</p>
<p>orders through Dona Stefania.
</p>
<p>" I permit them to enter," said the princess. " Stand
</p>
<p>aside, ladies. I am a man in a moment like this ; and I
</p>
<p>ought to be so." Then raising the bed-curtains, she
</p>
<p>continued, addressing the two officers,
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, first remember that you answer with
</p>
<p>your heads for the life of the princes, my children. You
</p>
<p>know that, M. de Guitaut ? "
</p>
<p>"I sleep across their doorway, Madame; but this move-'
</p>
<p>ment does not threaten either them or your Majesty."
</p>
<p>'Tis well; do not think of me until after them,"
</p>
<p>interrupted the queen, " and protect indiscriminately all

</p>
<p>Bassompierre ; you are a gentleman. Forget that your
</p>
<p>uncle is yet in the Bastille, and do your duty by the
</p>
<p>grandsons of the dead king, his friend."
</p>
<p>He was a young man, with a frank open countenance.
</p>
<p>" Your Majesty," said he, with a slight German ac-
</p>
<p>cent, " may see that I have forgotten my family, and
</p>
<p>not yours." And he displayed his left hand despoiled
</p>
<p>of two fingers, which had just been cut off. " I have
</p>
<p>still another hand," said he, bowing, .and withdrawing
</p>
<p>with Guitaut.
</p>
<p>The queen, much moved, rose immediately, and de-
</p>
<p>spite the prayers of the Princesse de Gue'mene', the
</p>
<p>tears of Marie de Gonzaga, and the cries of Madame de
</p>
<p>Chevreuse, insisted upon placing herself at the window,
</p>
<p>and half opened it, leaning upon the shoulder of the
</p>
<p>Duchesse de Mantua.
</p>
<p>" What do I hear ? " she said. " They are crying
</p>
<p>* Long live the king ! Long live the queen ! ' :
</p>
<p>The people, imagining they recognized her, redoubled
</p>
<p>their cries at this moment, and shouted louder than ever,
</p>
<p>" Down with the cardinal ! Long live M. le Grand ! "
</p>
<p>Marie shuddered.
</p>
<p>" What is the matter with you ? " said the queen,
</p>
<p>observing her. But as she did not answer, and trembled
</p>
<p>in every limb, this good and gentle princess appeared
</p>
<p>not to perceive it ; and paying the greatest attention
</p>
<p>to the cries and movements of the populace, she even
</p>
<p>exaggerated an inquietude which she had not felt since
</p>
<p>the first name had reached her ear. An hour after,

</p>
<p>ciously, and with an air of satisfaction. But this joy was
</p>
<p>far from being complete, for her heart was still troubled
</p>
<p>by many things, and, above all, by the presentiment of
</p>
<p>the regency. The more she leaned forward to show her-
</p>
<p>self, the more she beheld the revolting scenes which
</p>
<p>the increasing light exhibited. Terror took possession
</p>
<p>of her soul as it became necessary to appear calm and
</p>
<p>confiding; and her heart was saddened at the very
</p>
<p>gayety of her words and countenance. Exposed to
</p>
<p>all eyes, she felt herself a woman, and shuddered in
</p>
<p>looking at that people whom she would soon perhaps
</p>
<p>have to govern, and who already took upon themselves
</p>
<p>to demand the death of ministers, and to call upon
</p>
<p>their queen to appear before them.
</p>
<p>She saluted them.
</p>
<p>A hundred and fifty years after, that salute was re-
</p>
<p>peated by another princess, like herself of Austrian
</p>
<p>blood, and Queen of France. The monarchy without
</p>
<p>basis, such as Richelieu made it, was born and died
</p>
<p>between these two salutes.
</p>
<p>The princess at last closed her windows, and hastened
</p>
<p>to dismiss her timid suite. The thick curtains fell
</p>
<p>again over the barred windows ; and the chamber was
</p>
<p>no longer lighted by a day which was odious to her.
</p>
<p>Large white wax flambeaux burned in candelabra, in
</p>
<p>the form of golden arms, which stood out from the
</p>
<p>framed .and flowered tapestries with which the walls
</p>
<p>were covered. She remained alone with Marie de
</p>
<p>Mantua ; and re-entering with her the enclosure which
</p>
<p>was formed by the royal balustrade, she fell in a reclin-

<p>ing posture upon her bed, fatigued by her courage and
</p>
<p>28 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>her smiles, and burst into tears, her head supported by
</p>
<p>her pillow. Marie, on her knees upon a velvet footstool,
</p>
<p>held one of her hands in both hers, and without daring
</p>
<p>to speak first, leaned her head tremblingly upon it ; for
</p>
<p>until that moment, a tear had never been seen in the
</p>
<p>queen's eyes.
</p>
<p>They remained thus for some minutes. The princess,
</p>
<p>then raising herself up by a painful effort, spoke,
</p>
<p>" Do not afflict yourself, my child ; let me weep. 'T is
</p>
<p>such a relief to one who reigns! If you pray to God
</p>
<p>for me, ask him to grant me sufficient strength riot to
</p>
<p>hate the enemy who pursues me everywhere, and who
</p>
<p>will destroy the royal family of France and the mon-
</p>
<p>archy by his measureless ambition. I recognize him in
</p>
<p>all that has just taken place ; I see him in this tumult-
</p>
<p>uous revolt."
</p>
<p>" What, Madame ! is he not at Narbonne ? for it is
</p>
<p>the cardinal of whom you speak, no doubt; and have
</p>
<p>you not heard that these cries were for you, and against
</p>
<p>him?"
</p>
<p>" Yes, mon amie, he is three hundred leagues away
</p>
<p>from us, but his fatal genius watches at the door. If
</p>
<p>these cries have been heard, it is because he has allowed
</p>
<p>them ; if these men were assembled, it is because they
</p>
<p>have not yet reached the hour which he has destined for
</p>
<p>their destruction. Believe me, I know him ; and I have
</p>
<p>dearly paid for the knowledge of that dark soul. It has
</p>
<p>cost me all the power of my rank, the pleasures of my
</p>
<p>age, the affections of my family, and even the heart

<p>of my husband. He has isolated me from the whole

<p>and respect ; and formerly he dared, to the scandal of
</p>
<p>all France, to bring an accusation against myself. They
</p>
<p>examined my papers, they interrogated me, they made
</p>
<p>me sign myself guilty, and ask the king's pardon for a

<p>now does. Be sure, my dear child, that this man is
</p>
<p>everywhere, and that he knows even our thoughts."
</p>
<p>" What, Madame ! does he know all that these men
</p>
<p>have cried under your windows, and the names of those
</p>
<p>who sent them ? "
</p>
<p>" Yes ; no doubt he knows it, or has foreseen it. He
</p>
<p>permits it; he authorizes it to compromise me in the
</p>
<p>king's eyes, and keep him eternally separated from me.
</p>
<p>He would complete my humiliation."
</p>
<p>" But the king has not loved him for two years ; he
</p>
<p>loves another."
</p>
<p>The queen smiled ; she gazed some time in silence
</p>
<p>upon the pure and open features of the beautiful Marie,
</p>
<p>and her look, full of candor, which was languidly raised
</p>
<p>towards her. She smoothed back the black ringlets
</p>
<p>which shaded her noble forehead, and seemed to rest
</p>
<p>her eyes and her soul in looking at that charming inno-
</p>
<p>cence displayed upon so lovely a face. She kissed her
</p>
<p>cheek, and resumed,

<p>of the cardinal's gold could draw from him one word of the queen's

</p>
<p>" You do not suspect, my poor girl, a sad truth. It is
</p>
<p>that the king loves no one, and that those who appear
</p>
<p>the most in favor will be the soonest abandoned by him,
</p>
<p>and thrown to him who engulfs and devours all."
</p>
<p>" Ah, mon Dieu ! what is this you tell me ? "
</p>
<p>" Know you how many he has destroyed ? " continued
</p>
<p>the queen, in a low voice, and looking into her eyes as if
</p>
<p>to read in them all her thoughts, and to make her own
</p>
<p>penetrate there. " Know you the end of his favorites ?
</p>
<p>Have you been told of the exile of Baradas ; of that
</p>
<p>of Saint-Simon; of the convent of Mademoiselle de la
</p>
<p>Fayette, the shame of Madame d'Hautfort, the death of
</p>
<p>Chalais ? All have fallen before an order from Riche-
</p>
<p>lieu to his master. Without this favor, which you mis-
</p>
<p>take for friendship, their life would have been peaceful.
</p>
<p>But this favor is mortal ; it is a poison. Look at this
</p>
<p>tapestry which represents Se'me'le'. The favorites of
</p>
<p>Louis XIII. resemble that woman ; his attachment de-
</p>
<p>vours like this fire, which dazzles and consumes her."
</p>
<p>But the young duchesse was no longer in a condition
</p>
<p>to listen to the queen. She continued to fix her large
</p>
<p>dark eyes upon her, dimmed by a veil of tears ; her
</p>
<p>hands trembled in those of Anne of Austria, and her
</p>
<p>lips quivered with convulsive agitation.
</p>
<p>" I am very cruel, am I not, Marie ? " continued the
</p>
<p>queen, in an extremely sweet voice, and caressing her
</p>
<p>like a child from whom one would draw an avowal.
</p>
<p>" Oh, yes ; no doubt I am very wicked ! Your heart is
</p>
<p>full ; you cannot bear it, my child. Come, tell me ; how
</p>
<p>stands it with you and M. de Cinq-Mars ? "

<p>At this word grief found a passage, and still on her
</p>
<p>THE ALCOVE. 31
</p>
<p>knees at the queen's feet, Marie in her turn shed upon
</p>
<p>the bosom of the good princess a deluge of tears, with
</p>
<p>childish sobs and so violent an agitation of her head and
</p>
<p>her fine shoulders that it seemed as though her heart
</p>
<p>would break. The queen waited a long time for the
</p>
<p>end of this first movement, rocking her in her arms as
</p>
<p>if to appease her grief, frequently repeating, " My child,
</p>
<p>my child, do not afflict yourself thus ! "
</p>
<p>" Ah, Madame ! " she exclaimed, " I have been guilty
</p>
<p>towards you ; but I did not reckon upon that heart.
</p>
<p>I have done wrong, and I shall perhaps be punished
</p>
<p>severely for it. But, alas ! how shall I venture to speak
</p>
<p>to you, Madame ? It was not so much to open my heart
</p>
<p>to you that was difficult ; it was to avow to you that I
</p>
<p>had need to read there myself."
</p>
<p>The queen considered a moment as if to reflect ;
</p>
<p>placing her finger upon her lips, " You are right,"
</p>
<p>she then replied ; " you are quite right. Marie, it is
</p>
<p>always the first word which is the most difficult to
</p>
<p>say ; and that difficulty often destroys us. But it must
</p>
<p>be so ; and without this tenacity one would be often
</p>
<p>wanting in dignity. Ah, how difficult it is to reign !
</p>
<p>Here I would descend into your heart, but I come
</p>
<p>too late to do you good."
</p>
<p>Marie de Mantua hung her head without making any
</p>
<p>answer.
</p>
<p>" Must I encourage you to speak ? " said the queen.
</p>
<p>" Must I remind you that I have almost adopted you for
</p>
<p>my eldest daughter ; that after having sought to unite
</p>
<p>you with the king's brother, I prepared for you the

</p>
<p>32 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>must, I will. If afterwards you do not bare your whole
</p>
<p>heart to me, I have misjudged you. Open this golden
</p>
<p>casket ; here is the key. Open it fearlessly ; do not
</p>
<p>tremble as I do."
</p>
<p>The Duchesse de Mantua obeyed with hesitation, and
</p>
<p>beheld in this little chased coffer a knife of rude form,
</p>
<p>the handle of which was of iron, and the blade very
</p>
<p>rusty. It lay upon some letters carefully folded, upon
</p>
<p>which was the name of Buckingham. She would have
</p>
<p>lifted them up; Anne of Austria stopped her.
</p>
<p>" Seek nothing further," she said ; " that is all the
</p>
<p>treasure of the queen. And it is one; for it is the
</p>
<p>blood of a man who lives no longer, but who lived for
</p>
<p>me. He was the most beautiful, the bravest, the most
</p>
<p>illustrious of the nobles of Europe. He covered himself
</p>
<p>with the diamonds of the English crown to please me.
</p>
<p>He raised up a fierce war and armed fleets, which he
</p>
<p>himself commanded, that he might have the happiness
</p>
<p>of once fighting him who was my husband. He trav-
</p>
<p>ersed the seas to gather a flower upon which I had trod,
</p>
<p>and ran the risk of death to kiss and bathe with his
</p>
<p>tears the foot of this bed in the presence of two of
</p>
<p>my ladies-in-waiting. Shall I say more ? Yes, I will
</p>
<p>say it to you, I loved him. I love him still in the
</p>
<p>past more than I could love him in the present. He
</p>
<p>never knew it, never divined it. This face, these eyes
</p>
<p>were marble towards him, while my heart burned and
</p>
<p>was breaking with grief ; but I was the Queen of
</p>
<p>France ! " Here Anne of Austria forcibly grasped
</p>
<p>Marie's arm. " Dare now to complain," she continued,

<p>" if you have not yet ventured to speak to me of your
</p>
<p>THE ALCOVE. 33
</p>
<p>love, and dare now to be silent when I have told you
</p>
<p>these things ! "
</p>
<p>" Ah, yes, Madame, I shall dare to confide my grief to
</p>
<p>you, since you are to me "
</p>
<p>" A friend, a woman ! " interrupted the queen. " I
</p>
<p>was a woman in my terror, which put you in possession
</p>
<p>of a secret unknown to the whole world. I am a woman
</p>
<p>by a love which survives the man I loved. Speak ; tell
</p>
<p>me ! It is now time."
</p>
<p>" It is too late, on the contrary," replied Marie, with a
</p>
<p>forced smile. " M. de Cinq-Mars and myself are united
</p>
<p>forever."
</p>
<p>" Forever ! " exclaimed the queen. " Can you mean
</p>
<p>it? And your rank, your name, your future, is all
</p>
<p>lost ? Do you reserve this despair for your brother,
</p>
<p>the Due de Bethel, and all the Gonzagas ? "
</p>
<p>" For more than four years I have thought of it. I
</p>
<p>am resolved ; and for ten days we have been affianced."
</p>
<p>" Affianced ! " exclaimed the queen, clasping her
</p>
<p>hands. " You have been deceived, Marie. Who would
</p>
<p>have dared this without the king's order ? It is an
</p>
<p>intrigue which I will know. I am sure that you have
</p>
<p>been misled and deceived."
</p>
<p>Marie hesitated a moment, and then said,
</p>
<p>" Nothing was more simple, Madame, than our attach-
</p>
<p>ment. I inhabited, you know, the old chateau of Chau-
</p>
<p>mont, with the Mardchale d'Effiat, the mother of M. de
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars. I had retired there to weep for the death of
</p>
<p>my father ; and it soon happened that he had to deplore
</p>
<p>the loss of his. In this numerous afflicted family, I saw
</p>
<p>his grief only, which was as profound as mine. All that

</p>
<p>he said, I had already thought, and when we spoke of
</p>
<p>our afflictions we found them wholly alike. As I had
</p>
<p>been the first to suffer, I was better acquainted with
</p>
<p>sorrow than he; and I endeavored to console him by
</p>
<p>telling him all that I had suffered, so that in pitying
</p>
<p>me he forgot himself. This was the commencement of
</p>
<p>our love, which, as you see, took its birth, as it were,
</p>
<p>between two tombs."
</p>
<p>" God grant, ma chere, that it may have a happy ter-
</p>
<p>mination ! " said the queen.
</p>
<p>" I hope so, Madame, since you pray for me," contin-
</p>
<p>ued Marie. " Besides, everything now smiles upon me ;
</p>
<p>but at that time I was very miserable. The news ar-
</p>
<p>rived one day at the chateau that the cardinal had called
</p>
<p>M. de Cinq-Mars to the army. It seemed to me that I was
</p>
<p>again deprived of one of my relatives ; and yet we were
</p>
<p>strangers. But M. de Bassompierre spoke without ceas-
</p>
<p>ing of battles and death. I retired every evening in
</p>
<p>grief, and I wept during the night. I at first thought
</p>
<p>that my tears flowed for the past, but I soon perceived
</p>
<p>that it was for the future ; and I felt that they could not
</p>
<p>be the same tears, since I wished to conceal them.
</p>
<p>Some time passed in the expectation of his departure.
</p>
<p>I saw him every day ; and I pitied him for having to de-
</p>
<p>part, because he repeated to me every instant that he
</p>
<p>would have wished to live eternally as he then did, in
</p>
<p>his country and with us. He was thus without ambi-
</p>
<p>tion until the day of his departure, because he knew not
</p>
<p>whether he was whether he was "

<p>Marie blushed, cast down her humid eyes, and

</p>
<p>" Well ! " said the queen, " whether he was beloved,
</p>
<p>is it not so ? "
</p>
<p>" And in the evening, Madame, he left, ambitious."
</p>
<p>" That is evident, certainly. He left," said Anne of
</p>
<p>Austria, somewhat relieved ; " but he has been back two
</p>
<p>years, and you have seen him ? "
</p>
<p>" Seldom, Madame," said the young duchesse, proudly ;
</p>
<p>" and always in the presence of the priest, before whom
</p>
<p>I have promised to be the wife of no other than Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars."
</p>
<p>" Is it really, then, a marriage ? Have they dared to
</p>
<p>do it ? I shall inquire. But, Heaven, what faults ! how
</p>
<p>many faults in the few words I have heard ! Let me
</p>
<p>reflect upon them."
</p>
<p>And speaking aloud to herself, the queen continued,
</p>
<p>her eyes and head bent down in the attitude of reflection :
</p>
<p>" Reproaches are useless and cruel if the evil is done.
</p>
<p>The past is no longer ours ; let us think of the future.
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars is brave, able, and even profound in his ideas.
</p>
<p>I have observed that he has made a great way in two
</p>
<p>years, and I now see that it was for Marie. He com-
</p>
<p>ports himself well ; he is worthy of her in my eyes, but
</p>
<p>not so in the eyes of Europe. He must rise yet higher.
</p>
<p>The Princesse de Mantua cannot, may not marry less
</p>
<p>than a prince. He must become one. Of myself I can
</p>
<p>do nothing ; I am not the queen, I am the neglected
</p>
<p>wife of the king. There is only the cardinal, the eter-
</p>
<p>nal cardinal, and he is his enemy ; and perhaps this
</p>
<p>disturbance "

</p>
<p>" He is then lost ! " exclaimed the queen, embracing
</p>
<p>Marie. " Pardon, my child, for thus afflicting you ; but
</p>
<p>in times like these we must see all and say all. Yes,
</p>
<p>he is lost if he does not himself overthrow this wicked
</p>
<p>man, for the king will not renounce him ; force
</p>
<p>alone "
</p>
<p>"He will overthrow him, Madame. He will do it, if
</p>
<p>you assist him. You are the divinity of France. Oh,
</p>
<p>I conjure you, protect the angel against the demon ! It
</p>
<p>is your cause, that of your royal family, that of all your
</p>
<p>nation."
</p>
<p>The queen smiled.
</p>
<p>" It is, above all, your cause, my child ; and it is as
</p>
<p>such that I will embrace it to the utmost extent of my
</p>
<p>power. It is not great, I have told you ; but such as it
</p>
<p>is, I lend it to you entirely, provided, however, that this
</p>
<p>angel does not stoop to commit mortal sins," added she,
</p>
<p>with a meaning look. " I heard his name pronounced
</p>
<p>this night by voices most unworthy of him."
</p>
<p>" Oh, Madame, I would swear that he knows nothing
</p>
<p>of it ! "
</p>
<p>" Ah, my child, do not speak of State affairs. You
</p>
<p>are not yet learned enough in them. Let me sleep, if 1
</p>
<p>can, before the hour of my toilet. My eyes are burning,
</p>
<p>and yours also, perhaps."
</p>
<p>Saying these words, the amiable queen reclined her
</p>
<p>head upon the pillow which covered the casket, and soon
</p>
<p>Marie saw her fall asleep through utter fatigue. She
</p>
<p>then rose, and seating herself in a great tapestried
</p>
<p>square armchair, joined her hands upon her knees, and

</p>
<p>began to reflect upon her painful situation. Consoled
</p>
<p>THE ALCOVE. 37
</p>
<p>by the aspect of her gentle protectress, she often raised
</p>
<p>her eyes to watch her slumber, and sent her in secret
</p>
<p>all the blessings which love ever showers upon those
</p>
<p>who protect it. sometimes kissing the tresses of her
</p>
<p>blond hair, as if by this kiss she could convey to her
</p>
<p>soul all the ideas favorable to the thought ever present
</p>
<p>to her mind.
</p>
<p>The queen's slumber was prolonged, while Marie
</p>
<p>thought and wept. However, she remembered that at
</p>
<p>ten o'clock she must appear at the royal toilet before all
</p>
<p>the court. She resolved to cast aside reflection, to dry
</p>
<p>her tears, and took a thick folio volume placed upon a table
</p>
<p>inlaid with enamel and medallions ; it was the " Astrde "
</p>
<p>of M. d'Urfe", a work de belle galanterie adored
</p>
<p>by the fair prudes of the court. The unsophisticated
</p>
<p>and straightforward mind of Marie could not enter into
</p>
<p>these pastoral loves. She was too simple to understand
</p>
<p>the " bergers du Lignon," too clever to be pleased at their
</p>
<p>discourse, and too impassioned to feel their tenderness.
</p>
<p>However, the great vogue of the romance so far influ-
</p>
<p>enced her that she sought to compel herself to take an
</p>
<p>interest in it ; and accusing herself internally every time
</p>
<p>that she felt the ennui which exhaled from the pages of
</p>
<p>the book, she ran through it with impatience to find
</p>
<p>something to please and transport her. An engraving
</p>
<p>arrested her attention. It represented the shepherdess
</p>
<p>Astre"e with high-heeled shoes, a corset, and an immense
</p>
<p>vertugadin, raising herself upon her toe to watch float-
</p>
<p>ing down the river the tender Celadon, drowning him-
</p>
<p>self in despair at having been somewhat coldly received

<p>in the morning. Without explaining to herself the
</p>
<p>38 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>reason of the taste and accumulated fallacies of this
</p>
<p>picture, she sought, in turning over the pages, a word
</p>
<p>which could fix her attention ; she saw that of " Druid."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! here is a great character," said she. " I shall
</p>
<p>no doubt see one of those mysterious sacrificers of
</p>
<p>whom Britain, I am told, still preserves the raised
</p>
<p>monuments ; but I shall see him sacrificing men. That
</p>
<p>would be a spectacle of horror ; however, let us read it."
</p>
<p>Saying this, Marie read with repugnance, knitting her
</p>
<p>brows, and nearly trembling, the following :
</p>
<p>" The Druid Adamas delicately called the shepherds
</p>
<p>Firaandre, Ligdamont, and Clidamant, newly arrived from
</p>
<p>Calais. ' This adventure cannot terminate,' said he, ' but
</p>
<p>by the extremity of love. The soul, when it loves, trans-
</p>
<p>forms itself into the object beloved ; it is to represent this that
</p>
<p>my agreeable enchantments will show you in this fountain
</p>
<p>the nymph Sylvia, whom you all three love. The high-
</p>
<p>priest Amasis is about to come from Montbrison, and will
</p>
<p>explain to you the delicacy of this idea. Go, then, gentle
</p>
<p>shepherds ! If your desires are well regulated, they will not
</p>
<p>cause you any torments ; and if they are not so, you will be
</p>
<p>punished by faintings similar to those of Celadon, and the
</p>
<p>shepherdess Galatea, whom the inconstant Hercules aban-
</p>
<p>doned in the mountains of Auvergne, and who gave her
</p>
<p>name to the tender countiy of the Gauls ; or you will be
</p>
<p>stoned by the shepherdesses of Lignon, as was the fero-
</p>
<p>cious Amiclor. The great nymph of this cave has made an
</p>
<p>enchantment.' "
</p>
<p>The enchantment of the great nymph was complete
</p>
<p>on the princess, who had scarcely sufficient strength to
</p>
<p>find out with a trembling hand, towards the end of the

</p>
<p>of these was placed the foot of the studious De Thou,
</p>
<p>who, already risen, examined with attention the new
</p>
<p>works of Descartes and Grotius. He was writing upon
</p>
<p>his knee his notes upon these books of philosophy and
</p>
<p>politics, which were then the general subjects of conver-
</p>
<p>sation ; but at this moment, the " Meditations Meta-
</p>
<p>physiques " absorbed all his attention. The philosopher
</p>
<p>of Touraine enchanted the young counsellor. Often,
</p>
<p>in his enthusiasm, he struck upon the book, uttering
</p>
<p>exclamations of admiration ; sometimes he took a sphere
</p>
<p>placed near him, and turning it some time with his fin-
</p>
<p>gers, abandoned himself to the most profound reveries of
</p>
<p>science ; then led by them to a still greater elevation of
</p>
<p>mind, he would suddenly throw himself upon his knees
</p>
<p>before a crucifix, placed upon the chimney-piece, because
</p>
<p>at the limits of the human mind he had found God. At
</p>
<p>other times he buried himself in his great armchair, so
</p>
<p>as to be nearly sitting upon his shoulders, and placing
</p>
<p>his two hands upon his eyes, followed in his head the
</p>
<p>trace of the reasoning of Rene Descartes, from this idea
</p>
<p>of the first meditation
</p>
<p>" Suppose that we are asleep, and that all these particu-
</p>
<p>larities namely, that we open our eyes, move our heads,
</p>
<p>spread our arms are nothing but false illusions "
</p>
<p>to this sublime conclusion of the third :
</p>
<p>" There remains only one thing to be said ; it is that like
</p>
<p>the idea of myself, that of God is born and produced with
</p>
<p>me from the time I was created. And certainly it should
</p>
<p>not be thought strange that God, in creating me, should
</p>
<p>have placed in me this idea, to be, as it were, the mark of the

</p>
<p>42 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>These thoughts entirely occupied the mind of the
</p>
<p>young counsellor, when a loud noise was heard under
</p>
<p>the windows. He thought that some house on fire
</p>
<p>excited these prolonged cries, and hastened to look to-
</p>
<p>wards the wing of the building occupied by his mother
</p>
<p>and sisters ; but all appeared to sleep there, and the
</p>
<p>chimneys did not even send forth any smoke, to attest
</p>
<p>i
</p>
<p>that its inhabitants were even awake. He blessed
</p>
<p>Heaven for it ; and running to another window, he saw
</p>
<p>the people, whose exploits we have witnessed, hasten-
</p>
<p>ing towards the narrow streets which led to the quay.
</p>
<p>After having examined this rabble rout of women and
</p>
<p>children, the ridiculous flag which led them, and the
</p>
<p>rude disguises of the men, " It is some popular fete
</p>
<p>or some carnival comedy," said he ; and again return-
</p>
<p>ing to the corner of the fire, he placed a large almanac
</p>
<p>upon the table, and carefully sought in it what saint
</p>
<p>was feted that day. He looked in the column of the
</p>
<p>month of December ; and finding at the fourth day of
</p>
<p>this month the name of Saint Barbe, he remembered
</p>
<p>that he had seen several small cannons and barrels pass,
</p>
<p>and perfectly satisfied with the explanation which he
</p>
<p>had given himself, hastened to drive away the inter-
</p>
<p>ruption which had called off his attention, and resumed
</p>
<p>his gentle studies, rising only sometimes to take a book
</p>
<p>from the shelves of his library, and, after having read
</p>
<p>in it a phrase, a line, or only a word, threw it from him
</p>
<p>upon his table or on the floor, covered in this way with
</p>
<p>books or papers which lie would not occupy himself in
</p>
<p>returning to their places, lest he should break the

</p>
<p>THE CONFUSION. 43
</p>
<p>All at once the door was hastily opened, and a name
</p>
<p>was announced which he had distinguished among those
</p>
<p>at the bar, a man whom his connections with the
</p>
<p>magistracy had made personally known to him.
</p>
<p>"And by what chance, at five o'clock in the morning,
</p>
<p>do I see M. Fournier ? " he cried. " Are there some
</p>
<p>unfortunates to defend, some families to be supported
</p>
<p>by the fruits of his talent, some error to dissipate in us,
</p>
<p>some virtue to awaken in our hearts ? for these are of
</p>
<p>his accustomed works. You come, perhaps, to inform
</p>
<p>me of some fresh humiliation of our parliament. Alas !
</p>
<p>the secret chambers of the Arsenal are more powerful
</p>
<p>than the ancient magistracy of Clovis. The parliament
</p>
<p>is on its knees ; all is lost, unless it is directly filled with
</p>
<p>men like yourself."
</p>
<p>" Monsieur, I do not merit your praise," said the
</p>
<p>advocate, entering, accompanied by a grave and aged
</p>
<p>man, enveloped like himself in a large cloak. " I
</p>
<p>deserve, on the contrary, your censure ; and I am
</p>
<p>almost a penitent, as is M. le Comte du Lude whom
</p>
<p>you see here. We come to ask an asylum for the
</p>
<p>day."
</p>
<p>" An asylum ! and against whom ? " said De Thou,
</p>
<p>making them sit down.
</p>
<p>"Against the lowest people in Paris, who will have
</p>
<p>us for chiefs, and from whom we fly. 'T is odious ; the
</p>
<p>sight, the smell, the ear, and the touch, above all, are
</p>
<p>too severely wounded by it," said M. du Lude, with a
</p>
<p>comical gravity. " It is too much ! "
</p>
<p>" Ah ! too much, you say ? " said De Thou, very much

<p>astonished, but not willing to show it
</p>
<p>44 CINQ- MARS.
</p>
<p>" Yes," answered the advocate ; " really, between our-
</p>
<p>selves, M. le Grand goes too far."
</p>
<p>" Yes, he advances things too fast. He will render
</p>
<p>all our projects abortive," added his companion.
</p>
<p>" Ah ! and you say he goes too far ? " replied M. de
</p>
<p>Thou, rubbing his chin, more and more surprised.
</p>
<p>It was three months since his friend Cinq-Mars had
</p>
<p>been to see him ; and he, without feeling much dis-
</p>
<p>quieted about it, knowing that he was at St. Germain
</p>
<p>in high favor, and never quitting the king, was far re-
</p>
<p>moved from the news of the court. Given up to his
</p>
<p>grave studies, he never heard of public events till they
</p>
<p>were forced upon his attention. He knew nothing of
</p>
<p>current life until the last moment, and often amused his
</p>
<p>intimate friends by his naive astonishment, the more
</p>
<p>so that from a little worldly vanity he desired to have
</p>
<p>it appear as though he were fully acquainted with the
</p>
<p>course of events, and tried to conceal the surprise he
</p>
<p>experienced at every fresh intelligence. He was now
</p>
<p>in this situation, and to this vanity was added the feel-
</p>
<p>ing of friendship; he would not have it supposed that
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars had been negligent towards him, and, for
</p>
<p>his friend's honor even, would appear to be informed
</p>
<p>of his projects.
</p>
<p>" You know very well how far we have proceeded,"
</p>
<p>continued the advocate.
</p>
<p>"Yes, of course. Well?"
</p>
<p>" Intimate as you are with him, you cannot be igno-
</p>
<p>rant that all has been organizing for a year past."
</p>
<p>" Certainly, all has been organizing ; but proceed."

<p>"You will admit with us that M. le Grand is wrong; ?"
</p>
<p>THE CONFUSION. 45
</p>
<p>" Ah, ah, that is as it may be ; but explain yourself.
</p>
<p>I shall see."
</p>
<p>" Well, you know upon what we had agreed at the
</p>
<p>last conference of which he informed you ? "
</p>
<p>" Ah ! that is to say pardon me, I perceive it
</p>
<p>nearly ; but set me a little upon the track."
</p>
<p>" 'T is useless ; you no doubt remember what he him-
</p>
<p>self recommended us to do at Marion de Lorme's ? "
</p>
<p>" To add no one to our list," said M. du Lude.
</p>
<p>" Ah, yes, yes ! I understand," said De Thou ; " that
</p>
<p>appears reasonable, very reasonable, truly."
</p>
<p>" Well," continued Fournier, " he himself has in-
</p>
<p>fringed this agreement ; for this morning, besides the
</p>
<p>ragamuffins whom that ferret the Abb6 de Gondi brought
</p>
<p>to us, there was some vagabond captain, who during the
</p>
<p>night struck with sword and poniard gentlemen of both
</p>
<p>parties, crying out at the top of his voice, ' A moi,
</p>
<p>D'Aubijoux ! You gained three thousand ducats from
</p>
<p>me ; here are three sword-thrusts for you. A moi. La
</p>
<p>Chapelle ! I will have ten drops of your blood in ex-
</p>
<p>change for my ten pistoles ! ' and I myself saw him
</p>
<p>attack these gentlemen and many more of both sides,
</p>
<p>loyally enough, it is true, for he only struck them in
</p>
<p>front and on their guard, but with great success, and
</p>
<p>with a most revolting impartiality."
</p>
<p>" Yes, Monsieur, and I was going to tell him my opin-
</p>
<p>ion," interposed Du Lude, " when I saw him escape
</p>
<p>through the crowd like a squirrel, laughing greatly with
</p>
<p>some ill-looking men with dark swarthy faces ; I do not
</p>
<p>doubt, however, that M. de Cinq-Mars sent him, for he

<p>gave orders to that Ambrosio whom you must know,
</p>
<p>46 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>that Spanish prisoner, that rascal whom he has taken
</p>
<p>for a servant. In faith, I am disgusted with all this ;
</p>
<p>and I was not born to be mixed up with this canaille."
</p>
<p>" This, sir," replied Fournier, " is very different from
</p>
<p>the affair at Loudun. There the people only rose, with-
</p>
<p>out actually revolting ; it was the sensible and estimable
</p>
<p>part of the populace, indignant at an assassination, and
</p>
<p>not heated by wine and money. It was a cry raised
</p>
<p>against an executioner, a cry of which one could be the
</p>
<p>honorable organ, and. not these howlings of factious
</p>
<p>hypocrisy, of a mass of unknown people, the dregs of
</p>
<p>the mud and sewers of Paris. I confess that I am very
</p>
<p>tired of what I see ; and I have come to entreat you to
</p>
<p>speak about it to M. le Grand."
</p>
<p>De Thou was very much embarrassed during this con-
</p>
<p>versation, and sought in vain to understand what Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars could have to do with the people, who appeared to
</p>
<p>him merely merry-making ; on the other hand, he per-
</p>
<p>sisted in not owning his ignorance. It was, however,
</p>
<p>entire ; for the last time he had seen his friend, he had
</p>
<p>spoken only of the king's horses and stables, of hawking,
</p>
<p>and of the importance of the king's huntsmen in the
</p>
<p>affairs of the State, which did not seem to announce vast
</p>
<p>projects in which the people could take a part. He at
</p>
<p>last timidly ventured to say,
</p>
<p>" Messieurs, I promise to do your commission ; mean-
</p>
<p>while, I offer you my table and beds as long as you
</p>
<p>please. But to give my advice in this matter is very
</p>
<p>difficult. By the way, it was not the fete of Saint Barbe
</p>
<p>I saw this morning ? "

<p>" The Saint Barbe ! " said Fournier.
</p>
<p>THE CONFUSION. 47
</p>
<p>" The Saint Barbe ! " echoed Du Lude. " They burned
</p>
<p>powder."
</p>
<p>" Oh, yes, yes ! that is what M. de Thou means," said
</p>
<p>Fournier, laughing ; " very good, very good indeed !
</p>
<p>Yes, I think to-day is Saint Barbe."
</p>
<p>De Thou was now altogether confused and reduced to
</p>
<p>silence ; as for the others, seeing that they did not under-
</p>
<p>stand him, nor he them, they had recourse to silence.
</p>
<p>They were sitting thus mute, when the door opened to
</p>
<p>admit the old tutor of Cinq-Mars, the Abbe" Quillet, who
</p>
<p>entered, limping somewhat. He looked very gloomy,
</p>
<p>retaining none of his former gayety in his air or lan-
</p>
<p>guage ; but his look was still animated, and his speech
</p>
<p>energetic.
</p>
<p>" Pardon me, my dear De Thou, that I so early de-
</p>
<p>range you in your occupations ; it is strange, is it not,
</p>
<p>in a gouty invalid ? Ah, time advances ; two years ago
</p>
<p>I did not limp. I was, on the contrary, nimble enough
</p>
<p>at the time of my journey to Italy ; but then fear gives
</p>
<p>legs as well as wings."
</p>
<p>Then going into the recess of a window, he signed De
</p>
<p>Thou to come to him.
</p>
<p>" I need hardly remind you, my friend, who are in
</p>
<p>their secrets, that I affianced them a fortnight ago, as
</p>
<p>they have told you."
</p>
<p>"Ah, indeed! whom?" exclaimed poor De Thou,
</p>
<p>fallen from the Charybdis into the Scylla of
</p>
<p>astonishment. ,
</p>
<p>" Come, come, don't affect surprise ; you know very
</p>
<p>well whom," continued the abbe*. " But, faith, I fear I

</p>
<p>children are really interesting in their love. I fear for
</p>
<p>him more than for her ; I doubt not he is acting very
</p>
<p>foolishly, judging from the disturbance this morning.
</p>
<p>We must consult together about it."
</p>
<p>" But," said De Thou, very gravely, " upon my honor,
</p>
<p>I do not know what you mean. Who is acting
</p>
<p>foolishly ? "
</p>
<p>" Now, my dear sir, will you still play the mysterious
</p>
<p>with me ? It is really insulting," said the worthy man,
</p>
<p>beginning to be angry.
</p>
<p>" No, indeed, I mean it not ; whom have you
</p>
<p>affianced?"
</p>
<p>" Again ! fie, sir ! "
</p>
<p>" And what was the disturbance this morning ? "
</p>
<p>" You are mocking me ! I take my leave," said the
</p>
<p>abbe", rising.
</p>
<p>" I vow that I understand not a word of all that has
</p>
<p>been told me to-day. Do you mean M. de Cinq-Mars ? "
</p>
<p>" Very well, sir, very well ! you treat me as a Cardi-
</p>
<p>nalist ; very well, we part," said the Abbe" Quillet, now
</p>
<p>altogether furious. And he snatched up his crutch and
</p>
<p>quitted the room hastily, without listening to De Thou,
</p>
<p>who followed him to his carriage, seeking to pacify him,
</p>
<p>but without effect, because he did not wish to name his
</p>
<p>friend upon the stairs in the hearing of his servants, and
</p>
<p>could not explain the matter otherwise. He had the
</p>
<p>annoyance of seeing the old abb depart, still in a pas-
</p>
<p>sion ; he called out to him amicably, " To-morrow," as
</p>
<p>the coachman drove off, but got no answer.
</p>
<p>It was, however, not uselessly that he had descended

<p>of the mob returning from the Louvre, and was thus
</p>
<p>better able to judge of the importance of their move-
</p>
<p>ments in the morning ; he heard rude voices exclaiming,
</p>
<p>as in triumph,
</p>
<p>" She showed herself, however, the little queen ! "
</p>
<p>" Long live the good Due de Bouillon, who is coming to
</p>
<p>us ! He 's got a hundred thousand men with him, all on
</p>
<p>rafts on the Seine. The old Cardinal de la Rochelle is
</p>
<p>dead ! Long live the king ! Long live M. le Grand ! "
</p>
<p>The cries redoubled at the arrival of a carriage and
</p>
<p>four, with the royal livery, which stopped at the counsel-
</p>
<p>lor's door, and in which De Thou recognized the equi-
</p>
<p>page of Cinq-Mars ; Ambrosio alighted to open the ample
</p>
<p>curtains, which the carriages of that period had for doors.
</p>
<p>The people threw themselves between the carriage-steps
</p>
<p>and the door of the house, so that Cinq-Mars had an
</p>
<p>absolute struggle ere he could get out and disengage
</p>
<p>himself from the market-women, who sought to embrace
</p>
<p>him, vociferating,
</p>
<p>" Here you are, then, my duck, my dear ! Here you
</p>
<p>are, my pet ! Ah, how handsome he is, the love, with
</p>
<p>his big collar ! Is n't he worth half a dozen of the other
</p>
<p>fellow with the white mustache ? Come, my son, bring
</p>
<p>us out some good wine this morning."
</p>
<p>Henri d'Effiat pressed, blushing deeply the while, his
</p>
<p>friend's hand, who hastened to have his doors closed.
</p>
<p>" This popular favor is a cup one must drink," said
</p>
<p>he, as they ascended the stairs.
</p>
<p>" It appears to me," replied De Thou, gravely, " that
</p>
<p>you drink it even to the very dregs."

<p>will shake my resolution, I warn you. I have just said
</p>
<p>so to the gentlemen at your house."
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars had in his accent nothing of the rudeness
</p>
<p>which might be implied from his words. His voice was
</p>
<p>conciliatory, his look gentle, amiable, affectionate, his
</p>
<p>air as tranquil as it was determined. There was no in-
</p>
<p>dication of the slightest effort over himself. De Thou
</p>
<p>remarked it, and sighed.
</p>
<p>As he descended from the carriage with him, he fol-
</p>
<p>lowed him up the great staircase of the Louvre. When
</p>
<p>they entered the queen's apartment, announced by two
</p>
<p>ushers dressed in black and bearing ebony rods, she was
</p>
<p>seated at her toilet. This was a sort of table of black
</p>
<p>wood, inlaid with tortoise-shell, mother-of-pearl, and
</p>
<p>brass, in an infinity of designs of very bad taste, but
</p>
<p>which give to all this sort of furniture an air of gran-
</p>
<p>deur which we still admire in it. A mirror, rounded at
</p>
<p>the top, which the ladies of our time would consider
</p>
<p>small and insignificant, stood in the middle of the table,
</p>
<p>with scattered jewels and necklaces. Anne of Austria,
</p>
<p>seated before it in a large armchair of crimson velvet,
</p>
<p>with long gold fringe, was as motionless and grave as
</p>
<p>on her throne, while Dona Stefania and Madame de
</p>
<p>Motteville, on either side, lightly touched her beautiful
</p>
<p>blond hair with a comb, as if finishing the queen's coif-
</p>
<p>fure, which, however, was already perfectly arranged
</p>
<p>and decorated with pearls. Her long tresses, though
</p>
<p>light, were exquisitely glossy, manifesting that to the
</p>
<p>touch they must be fine and soft as silk. The daylight
</p>
<p>fell without a shade upon her forehead, which had no

<p>reason to dread the test, itself reflecting an almost equal

</p>
<p>light from its surpassing fairness, which the queen was
</p>
<p>pleased thus to display. Her blue eyes, blended with
</p>
<p>green, were large and regular, and her vermilion mouth
</p>
<p>had that under-lip of the princesses of Austria, some-
</p>
<p>what prominent and slightly cleft, in the form of a
</p>
<p>cherry, which may .still be marked in all the female
</p>
<p>portraits of this time, whose painters seemed to have
</p>
<p>aimed at imitating the queen's mouth, in order to please
</p>
<p>the women of her suite, whose desire was, no doubt, to
</p>
<p>resemble her. The black dress then adopted by the
</p>
<p>court, and of which the form was even fixed by an edict,
</p>
<p>set off the ivory of her arms, bare to the elbow, and
</p>
<p>ornamented with a profusion of lace, which flowed from
</p>
<p>her loose sleeves. Large pearls hung in her ears and
</p>
<p>from her girdle. Such was the appearance of the queen
</p>
<p>at this moment. At her feet, upon two velvet cushions,
</p>
<p>a boy of four years old was playing with a little cannon,
</p>
<p>which he was assiduously breaking in pieces. This was
</p>
<p>the dauphin, afterwards Louis XIV. The Duchesse
</p>
<p>Marie de Gonzaga was seated on her right hand upon a
</p>
<p>stool. The Princesse de Gueme'ne', the Duchesse de
</p>
<p>Chevreuse, and Mademoiselle de Montbazon, Mesdemoi-
</p>
<p>selles de Guise, de Rohan, and de Vendome, all beauti-
</p>
<p>ful and brilliant in youth, were behind her, standing.
</p>
<p>In the recess of a window, Monsieur, his hat under his
</p>
<p>arm, was talking in a low voice with a man, stout, witli
</p>
<p>a red face and a steady and daring eye. This was the
</p>
<p>Due de Bouillon. An officer of about twenty-five years
</p>
<p>old, well-formed, and of agreeable features, had just
</p>
<p>given several papers to the prince, which the Due de

</p>
<p>Bouillon appeared to be explaining to him.
</p>
<p>54 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>De Thou, after having saluted the queen, who said a
</p>
<p>few words to him, approached the Princesse de Guemene*,
</p>
<p>and conversed with her in an undertone, with an air of
</p>
<p>affectionate intimacy, but all the while intent upon his
</p>
<p>friend's interest ; and secretly trembling lest he should
</p>
<p>have confided his destiny to a being less worthy of him
</p>
<p>than he wished, he examined the Princesse Marie with
</p>
<p>the scrupulous attention, the scrutinizing eye of a mother
</p>
<p>examining the woman whom her son has selected for
</p>
<p>his bride, for he thought that Marie could not be al-
</p>
<p>together a stranger to the enterprise of Cinq-Mars. He
</p>
<p>saw with dissatisfaction that her dress, which was ex-
</p>
<p>tremely elegant, appeared to inspire her' with more
</p>
<p>vanity than became her on such an occasion. She was
</p>
<p>incessantly rearranging upon her forehead and her hair
</p>
<p>the rubies which ornamented her head, and which
</p>
<p>scarcely equalled the brilliancy and animated color of
</p>
<p>her complexion. She looked frequently at Cinq-Mars ;
</p>
<p>but it was rather the look of coquetry than that of love,
</p>
<p>and her eyes often glanced towards the mirror on the
</p>
<p>toilet, in which she watched the symmetry of her beauty.
</p>
<p>These observations of the counsellor began to persuade
</p>
<p>him that he was mistaken in imagining her to be the bride
</p>
<p>of Cinq-Mars, especially when he saw that she seemed
</p>
<p>to have a pleasure in sitting at the queen's side, while
</p>
<p>the duchesses stood behind her, and that she often looked
</p>
<p>haughtily at them.
</p>
<p>" In that heart of nineteen," said he, " love, were
</p>
<p>there love, would reign alone and above all to-day. It
</p>
<p>is not she ! "

</p>
<p>The queen made an almost imperceptible movement
</p>
<p>THE TOILET. 55
</p>
<p>of the head to Madame de Gueme'ne'. After the two
</p>
<p>friends had spoken a moment with each person present,
</p>
<p>and at this sign, all the ladies except Marie de Gonzaga,
</p>
<p>making profound courtesies, quitted the apartment with-
</p>
<p>out speaking, as if by previous arrangement. The queen,
</p>
<p>then herself turning her chair, said to Monsieur,
</p>
<p>" My brother, I beg you will come and sit down by me.
</p>
<p>We will consult upon what I have already told you.
</p>
<p>The Princesse Marie will not be in the way. I begged
</p>
<p>her to remain. We have no interruption to apprehend."
</p>
<p>The queen seemed more at ease in her manner and
</p>
<p>language ; and no longer preserving her severe and
</p>
<p>ceremonious immobility, she signed to the other persons
</p>
<p>present to approach her.
</p>
<p>Gaston d'Orleans, somewhat alarmed at this solemn
</p>
<p>opening, came carelessly, sat down on her right hand,
</p>
<p>and said with a half-smile and a negligent air, playing
</p>
<p>with his ruff and the chain of the Saint Esprit which
</p>
<p>hung from his neck,
</p>
<p>" I think, Madame, that we shall fatigue the ears of
</p>
<p>so young a personage by a long conference. She would
</p>
<p>rather hear us speak of dances, and of marriage, of an
</p>
<p>elector, or of the King of Poland, for example."
</p>
<p>Marie assumed a disdainful air ; Cinq-Mars frowned.
</p>
<p>" Pardon me," replied the queen, looking at her ; " I
</p>
<p>assure you the politics of the present time interest her
</p>
<p>much. Do not seek to escape us, my brother," added
</p>
<p>she, smiling. " I have you to-day ! It is the least we
</p>
<p>can do to listen to M. de Bouillon."
</p>
<p>The latter approached, holding by the hand the young

<p>officer of whom we have spoken.
</p>
<p>56 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>"I must first," said he, "present to your Majesty
</p>
<p>the Baron de Beauvau, who has just arrived from
</p>
<p>Spain."
</p>
<p>" From Spain ? " said the queen, with emotion.
</p>
<p>" There is courage in that ; you have seen my
</p>
<p>family?"
</p>
<p>" He will speak to you of them, and of the Count-Duke
</p>
<p>of Olivares. As to courage, it is not the first time he
</p>
<p>has shown it. He commanded the cuirassiers of the
</p>
<p>Comte de Soissons."
</p>
<p>" How ? so young, sir ! You must be fond of political
</p>
<p>wars."
</p>
<p>"On the contrary, your Majesty will pardon me,"
</p>
<p>replied he, "for I served with the princes of the
</p>
<p>peace."
</p>
<p>Anne of Austria smiled at this jeu-de-mot. The Due
</p>
<p>de Bouillon, seizing the moment to bring forward the
</p>
<p>grand question he had in view, quitted Cinq-Mars, to
</p>
<p>whom he had just given his hand with an air of the
</p>
<p>most zealous friendship, and approaching the queen with
</p>
<p>him, " It is miraculous, Madame," said he, " that this
</p>
<p>period still contains in its bosom some noble characters,
</p>
<p>such as these ; " and he pointed to the master of the
</p>
<p>horse, to young Beauvau, and to De Thou. " It is only
</p>
<p>in them that we can place our hope for the future.
</p>
<p>Such men are indeed very rare now, for the great
</p>
<p>leveller has passed a long scythe over France."
</p>
<p>" Is it of Time you speak," said the queen, " or of a
</p>
<p>real personage ? "
</p>
<p>" Too real, too living, too long living, Madame ! " re-

</p>
<p>plied the due, becoming more animated ; " but his meas-
</p>
<p>THE TOILET. 57
</p>
<p>ureless ambition, his colossal selfishness can no longer
</p>
<p>be endured. All those who have noble hearts are in-
</p>
<p>dignant at this yoke ; and at this moment, more than
</p>
<p>ever, we see misfortunes threatening us in the future.
</p>
<p>It must be said, Madame, yes, it is no longer time
</p>
<p>to blind ourselves to the truth, or to conceal it, the
</p>
<p>king's illness is serious. The moment for thinking and
</p>
<p>resolving has arrived, for the time to act is not far
</p>
<p>distant."
</p>
<p>The severe and abrupt tone of M. de Bouillon did not
</p>
<p>surprise Anne of Austria ; but she had always seen him
</p>
<p>more calm, and was therefore somewhat alarmed by the
</p>
<p>disquietude he betrayed. Quitting accordingly the tone
</p>
<p>of pleasantry which she had at first adopted, she said,
</p>
<p>" How ! what fear you, and what would you do ? "
</p>
<p>" I fear nothing for myself, Madame, for the army of
</p>
<p>Italy or Sedan will always secure my safety ; but I fear
</p>
<p>for you, and perhaps for the princes, your sons."
</p>
<p>" For my children, M. le Due, for the sons of France ?
</p>
<p>Do you hear him, my brother, and do you not appear
</p>
<p>astonished ? "
</p>
<p>The queen was deeply agitated.
</p>
<p>" No, Madame," said Gaston d'0rle"ans, calmly ; " you
</p>
<p>know that I am accustomed to persecution. I am pre-
</p>
<p>pared to expect anything from that man. He is master;
</p>
<p>we must be resigned."
</p>
<p>" He master ! " exclaimed the queen. " And from
</p>
<p>whom does he hold his powers, if not from the king ?
</p>
<p>And after the king, what hand will sustain him, so
</p>
<p>please you ? Who will prevent him from again return-

<p>ing to nothing ? Will it be you or I ? "
</p>
<p>58 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>"It will be himself," interrupted M. de Bouillon, "for
</p>
<p>he seeks to be named regent; and I know that at this
</p>
<p>moment he contemplates taking your children from you,
</p>
<p>and requiring the king to confide them to his care."
</p>
<p>" Take them from me ! " cried the mother, involuntarily
</p>
<p>seizing the dauphin, and taking him in her arms.
</p>
<p>The child, standing between the queen's knees, looked
</p>
<p>at the men who surrounded him with a gravity very
</p>
<p>singular for his age, and seeing his mother in tears,
</p>
<p>placed his hand upon the little sword he wore.
</p>
<p>" All, Monseigneur," said the Due de Bouillon, bend-
</p>
<p>ing half down to address to him what he intended for
</p>
<p>the princess, " it is not against us that you must draw
</p>
<p>your sword, but against him who is undermining your
</p>
<p>throne. He prepares a mighty power for you, no doubt.
</p>
<p>You will have an absolute sceptre ; but he has broken
</p>
<p>the armed fasces which sustained it. That fasces was
</p>
<p>your ancient nobility, whom he has decimated. When
</p>
<p>you are king, you will be a great king. I foresee it; but
</p>
<p>you will only have subjects, and no friends, for friend-
</p>
<p>ship exists only in independence and a kind of equality
</p>
<p>which takes its rise in force. Your ancestors had their
</p>
<p>peers ; you will not have yours. May God aid you then,
</p>
<p>Monseigneur, for man may not do it without institu-
</p>
<p>tions ! Be great ; but above all, around you, a great
</p>
<p>man, let there be others as strong, so that if the one
</p>
<p>stumbles, the whole monarchy may not fall."
</p>
<p>The Due de Bouillon had <i warmth of expression
</p>
<p>and a confidence of manner which captivated those who
</p>
<p>heard him. His valor, his keen perception in the field,

</p>
<p>the profundity of his political views, his knowledge of
</p>
<p>THE TOILET. 59
</p>
<p>the affairs of Europe, his reflective and decided character,
</p>
<p>all rendered him one of the most capable and imposing
</p>
<p>men of his time, the only one, indeed, whom the car-
</p>
<p>dinal-due really feared. The queen always listened to
</p>
<p>him with confidence, and allowed him to acquire a sort
</p>
<p>of empire over her. She was now more deeply moved
</p>
<p>than ever.
</p>
<p>" Ah, would to God," she exclaimed, " that my son's
</p>
<p>mind was ripe for your counsels, and his arm strong
</p>
<p>enough to profit by them ! Until that time, however, I
</p>
<p>will listen, I will act for him. It is I who should be,
</p>
<p>and it is I who shall be, regent. I will not resign this
</p>
<p>right but with my life. If we must make war, we will
</p>
<p>make it ; for I will do everything but submit to the
</p>
<p>shame and terror of yielding up the future Louis XIV.
</p>
<p>to this crowned subject. Yes," she went on, coloring
</p>
<p>and closely pressing the young dauphin's arm, " yes, my
</p>
<p>brother, and you gentlemen, counsel me ! Speak ! how
</p>
<p>do we stand ? Must I depart ? Speak openly. As a
</p>
<p>woman, as a wife, I could have wept my so mournful po-
</p>
<p>sition ; but now see, as a mother, I do not weep. I am
</p>
<p>ready to give you orders if it be necessary."
</p>
<p>Never had Anne of Austria looked so beautiful as
</p>
<p>at this moment ; and the enthusiasm she manifested
</p>
<p>electrified all those present, who needed but a word
</p>
<p>from her mouth to speak. The Due de Bouillon cast
</p>
<p>a glance upon Monsieur, which decided him.
</p>
<p>" Ma foi!" said he, with deliberation, "if you give
</p>
<p>orders, my sister, I will be your captain of the guards,
</p>
<p>on my honor, for I too am weary of the vexations occa-

<p>sioned me by this knave, who still dares to persecute
</p>
<p>60 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>me and seeks to break off my marriage and still keeps
</p>
<p>my friends in the Bastille, or has them assassinated
</p>
<p>from time to time ; and besides, I am indignant," said
</p>
<p>he, recollecting himself and assuming a more solemn
</p>
<p>air, "I am indignant at the misery of the people."
</p>
<p>" My brother," returned the princess, energetically, " I
</p>
<p>take you at your word, for with you, one must do so ;
</p>
<p>and I hope that together we shall be strong enough for
</p>
<p>the purpose. Do only as M. le Comte de Soissons did,
</p>
<p>but survive your victory. Side with me, as you did with
</p>
<p>M. de Montmorency, but leap the ditch."
</p>
<p>Gaston felt the point of this. He called to mind
</p>
<p>the well-known incident when the unfortunate rebel of
</p>
<p>Castelnaudary leaped almost alone a large ditch, and
</p>
<p>found on the other side seventeen wounds, a prison, and
</p>
<p>death in the sight of Monsieur, who remained motion-
</p>
<p>less with his army. In the rapidity of the queen's enun-
</p>
<p>ciation he had not time to examine whether she had
</p>
<p>employed this expression proverbially or with a direct
</p>
<p>reference ; but at all events, he decided not to notice it,
</p>
<p>and was indeed prevented from doing so by the queen,
</p>
<p>who continued, looking at Cinq-Mars,
</p>
<p>" But, above all, no panic-terror ! Let us know exactly
</p>
<p>where we are, M. le Grand. You have just left the
</p>
<p>king. Is there fear with you?"
</p>
<p>D'Effiat had not ceased to observe Marie de Gonzaga,
</p>
<p>whose expressive countenance exhibited to him all her
</p>
<p>ideas far more rapidly and more surely than words. He
</p>
<p>read there the desire that he should speak, the desire
</p>
<p>that he should confirm the prince and the queen. An

</p>
<p>will that the thing should be accomplished, the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy arranged. His face became pale and more pen-
</p>
<p>sive ; he collected his thoughts for a moment, for he
</p>
<p>felt that his destiny was in that hour. De Thou looked
</p>
<p>at him and trembled, for he knew him well. He would
</p>
<p>fain have said one word to him, only one word ; but
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars had already raised his head. He spoke,
</p>
<p>" I do not think, Madame, that the king is so ill as
</p>
<p>you suppose. God will long preserve to us this prince.
</p>
<p>I hope so ; I am even sure of it. He suffers, it is true,
</p>
<p>suffers much ; but it is his soul more peculiarly that is
</p>
<p>sick, and of an evil which nothing can cure, of an evil
</p>
<p>which one would not wish to one's greatest enemy, and
</p>
<p>which would gain him the pity of the whole world if it
</p>
<p>were known. The end of his misery that is to say of
</p>
<p>his life will not be granted him for a long time. His
</p>
<p>languor is entirely moral. There is in his heart a great
</p>
<p>revolution going on ; he would accomplish it, and cannot.
</p>
<p>He has felt for many long years growing within him the
</p>
<p>seeds of a just hatred against a man to whom he thinks
</p>
<p>he owes gratitude, and it is this internal combat between
</p>
<p>his natural goodness and his anger that devours him.
</p>
<p>Every year that has passed has deposited at his feet, on
</p>
<p>one side, the great works of this man, and on the other,
</p>
<p>his crimes. It is the last which now weigh down the
</p>
<p>balance. The king sees them and is indignant ; he
</p>
<p>would punish, but all at once he stops and weeps. If
</p>
<p>you could witness him thus, Madame, you would pity
</p>
<p>him. I have seen him seize the pen which was to sign
</p>
<p>his exile, dip it into the ink with a bold hand, and use

<p>it for what? to congratulate him on some recent
</p>
<p>62 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>success. He at once applauds himself for his goodness
</p>
<p>as a Christian, curses himself for his weakness as a
</p>
<p>sovereign judge, despises himself as a king. He seeks
</p>
<p>a refuge in prayer, and plunges into meditation on the
</p>
<p>future ; then he rises terrified because he has seen in his
</p>
<p>thought the flames which this man merits, and which no
</p>
<p>one knows better than he how deeply he merits. You
</p>
<p>should hear him in these moments accuse himself of
</p>
<p>a guilty weakness, and exclaim that he shall himself
</p>
<p>be punished for not having known how to punish.
</p>
<p>.One would say that there are spirits which order
</p>
<p>him to strike, for his arms are raised as he sleeps.
</p>
<p>In a word, Madame, the storm murmurs in his heart,
</p>
<p>but burns none but himself. The lightning cannot
</p>
<p>escape."
</p>
<p>"Well, then, let us fire it!" exclaimed the Due de
</p>

</p>
<p>" He who touches it may die of the contact," said
</p>
<p>Monsieur.
</p>
<p>" But what a noble devotion ! " cried the queen.
</p>
<p>" How I should admire the hero ! " said Marie, in a
</p>
<p>half-whisper.
</p>
<p>" I will do it," answered Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>" We will do it," said M. de Thou, in his ear.
</p>
<p>Young Beauvau had approached the Due de Bouillon.
</p>
<p>" Monsieur," said he, " do you forget what follows ?"
</p>
<p>" No, pardieu ! I do not forget it," replied the latter,
</p>
<p>in a low voice ; then addressing the queen, " Madame,"
</p>
<p>said he, " accept the offer of M. le Grand. He is more

<p>but hold yourself prepared, for the cardinal is too wary

</p>
<p>to be caught sleeping. I do not believe in his illness.
</p>
<p>I have no faith in the silence and immobility of which
</p>
<p>he has sought to persuade us these two years past. I
</p>
<p>would not believe in his death even, unless I had myself
</p>
<p>thrown his head into the sea, like that of the giant in
</p>
<p>Ariosto. Hold yourself ready to meet all contingencies,
</p>
<p>and let us, meanwhile, hasten our operations. I have
</p>
<p>shown my plans to Monsieur just now ; I will give you
</p>
<p>a summary of them. I offer you Sedan, Madame, for
</p>
<p>yourself, and for Messeigneurs, your sons. The army of
</p>
<p>Italy is mine ; I will recall it if necessary. M. le Grand
</p>
<p>is master of half the camp of Perpignan. All the old
</p>
<p>Huguenots of La Rochelle and the South are ready to
</p>
<p>come to him at the first nod. All has been organized
</p>
<p>for a year past, by my care, to meet events."
</p>
<p>" I should not hesitate," said the queen, " to place
</p>
<p>myself in your hands, to save my children, if any mis-
</p>
<p>fortune should happen to the king. But in this general
</p>
<p>plan you forget Paris."
</p>
<p>" It is ours on every side ; the people by the arch-
</p>
<p>bishop, without his suspecting it, and by M. de Beaufort,
</p>
<p>who is its king ; the troops by your guards and those
</p>
<p>of Monsieur, who shall be chief in command, if he
</p>
<p>please."
</p>
<p>" Me ! me ! oh, that positively cannot be ! I have not
</p>
<p>enough people, and I must have a retreat stronger than
</p>
<p>Sedan," said Gaston.
</p>
<p>" It suffices for the queen," replied M. de Bouillon.
</p>
<p>" Ah, that may be ! but my sister does not risk so
</p>
<p>much as a man who draws the sword. Do you know

<p>these are bold measures you propose?"

<p>64 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" What, even if we have the king on our side ? "
</p>
<p>asked Anne of Austria.
</p>
<p>" Yes, Madame, yes ; we do not know how long that
</p>
<p>may last. We must make ourselves sure; and I do
</p>
<p>nothing without the treaty with Spain."
</p>
<p>" Do nothing, then," said the queen, coloring deeply ;
</p>
<p>" for certainly I will never hear that spoken of."
</p>
<p>" And, yet, Madame, it were more prudent, and Mon-
</p>
<p>sieur is right," said the Due de Bouillon ; " for the
</p>
<p>Count-Duke of San Lucra offers us seventeen thousand
</p>
<p>men, tried troops, and five hundred thousand crowns in
</p>
<p>ready money."
</p>
<p>" What ! " exclaimed the queen, with astonishment,
</p>
<p>" have you dared to proceed so far without my consent ?
</p>
<p>already treaties with foreigners ! "
</p>
<p>" Foreigners, my sister ! could we imagine that a
</p>
<p>princess of Spain would use that word ? " said Gaston.
</p>
<p>Anne of Austria rose, taking the dauphin by the
</p>
<p>hand ; and leaning upon Marie, " Yes, sir," she said,
</p>
<p>" I am a Spaniard ; but I am the granddaughter of
</p>
<p>Charles V., and I know that a queen's country is where
</p>
<p>her throne is. I leave you, gentlemen ; proceed without
</p>
<p>me. I know nothing of the matter for the future."
</p>
<p>She advanced some steps, but seeing Marie pale and
</p>
<p>bathed in tears, she returned.
</p>
<p>" I will, however, solemnly promise you inviolable
</p>
<p>secrecy ; but nothing more."
</p>
<p>All were mentally disconcerted, except the Due de
</p>
<p>Bouillon, who, not willing to lose the advantages he
</p>
<p>had gained, said to her, bowing respectfully,

<p>" We are grateful for this promise, Madame, and we
</p>
<p>THE TOILET. 65
</p>
<p>ask no more, persuaded that after the first success you
</p>
<p>will be entirely with us."
</p>
<p>Not wishing to engage in a war of words, the queen
</p>
<p>courtesied somewhat less coldly, and quitted the apart-
</p>
<p>ment with Marie, who cast upon Cinq-Mars one of those
</p>
<p>looks which comprehend at once all the emotions of the
</p>
<p>soul. He seemed to read in her beautiful eyes the
</p>
<p>eternal and mournful devotion of a woman who has
</p>
<p>given herself up forever; and he felt that if he had
</p>
<p>once thought of withdrawing from his enterprise, he
</p>
<p>should now have considered himself the basest of
</p>
<p>men.
</p>
<p>As soon as the two princesses had disappeared,
</p>
<p>" There, there ! I told you so, Bouillon, you offend the
</p>
<p>queen," said Monsieur ; "you went too far. You cannot
</p>
<p>certainly accuse me of having been hesitating this
</p>
<p>morning. I have, on the contrary, shown more resolu-
</p>
<p>tion than I ought to have done."
</p>
<p>" I am full of joy and gratitude towards her Majesty,"
</p>
<p>said M. de Bouillon, with a triumphant air ; " we are
</p>
<p>sure of the future. What will you do now, M. de Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars ? "
</p>
<p>" I have told you, sir ; I draw not back, whatever the
</p>
<p>consequences. I will see the king ; I will run every
</p>
<p>risk to obtain his assent."
</p>
<p>"And the treaty with Spain?"
</p>
<p>" Yes, I "
</p>
<p>De Thou seized Cinq-Mars by the arm, and advancing
</p>
<p>suddenly, said with a solemn air,
</p>
<p>" "We have decided that it shall be only signed after
</p>
<p>the interview with the king; for should his Majesty's

</p>
<p>just seventy towards the cardinal dispense with it, we
</p>
<p>have thought it better not to expose ourselves to the
</p>
<p>discovery of so dangerous a treaty."
</p>
<p>M. de Bouillon frowned.
</p>
<p>" If I did not know M. de Thou," said he, " I should
</p>
<p>have regarded this as a defection ; but from him "
</p>
<p>" Sir," replied the counsellor, " I think I may engage
</p>
<p>myself, on my honor, to do all that M. le Grand does ;
</p>
<p>we are inseparable."
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars looked at his friend, and was astonished to
</p>
<p>see upon his mild countenance the expression of sombre
</p>
<p>despair ; he was so struck with it that he had not the
</p>
<p>courage to gainsay him.
</p>
<p>"He is right, gentlemen," he said with a cold but
</p>
<p>kindly smile ; " the king will perhaps spare us much
</p>
<p>trouble. We may do good things with him. For the
</p>
<p>rest, Monseigneur, and you, M. le Due," he added with
</p>
<p>immovable firmness, "fear not that I shall ever draw
</p>
<p>back. I have burned all the bridges behind rne. I must
</p>
<p>advance ; the cardinal's power shall fall, or my head."
</p>
<p>" It is strange, very strange ! " said Monsieur ; " I see
</p>
<p>that every one here is farther advanced in the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy than I imagined."
</p>
<p>" Not so, sir," said the Due de Bouillon ; " we pre-
</p>
<p>pared only that which you might please to accept.
</p>
<p>Observe that there is nothing in writing. You have but
</p>
<p>to speak, and nothing exists or ever has existed ; ac-
</p>
<p>cording to your order, the whole thing shall be a dream
</p>
<p>or a volcano."
</p>
<p>" Well, well, I am content, if it must be so," said

<p>Gaston ; " let us occupy ourselves with more agreeable
</p>
<p>THE TOILET. 67
</p>
<p>topics. Thank God we have a little time before us!
</p>
<p>I confess I wish that it were all over. I am not fitted
</p>
<p>for violent emotions ; they affect my health," he added,
</p>
<p>taking M. de Beauvau's arm. " Tell us if the Spanish
</p>
<p>women are still pretty, young man. It is said you are
</p>
<p>a great gallant among them. Tudieu! I 'm sure you 've
</p>
<p>got yourself talked of there. They tell me the women
</p>
<p>wear enormous petticoats. Well, I am not at all against
</p>
<p>that ; they make the foot look smaller and prettier.
</p>
<p>I 'm sure the wife of Don Louis de Haro is not hand-
</p>
<p>somer than Madame de Gueme'n^ ; is she ? Come, be
</p>
<p>frank ; I 'm told she looks like a nun. Ah ! you do not
</p>
<p>answer; you are embarrassed. She has then taken your
</p>
<p>fancy ; or you fear to offend our friend M. de Thou
</p>
<p>in comparing her with the beautiful Gueme'ne'. Well,
</p>
<p>let's talk of the customs; the king has a charming
</p>
<p>dwarf I'm told, and they put him in a pie. He is a
</p>
<p>fortunate man, that King of Spain ! I don't know
</p>
<p>another equally so. And the queen, she is still served
</p>
<p>on bended knee, is she not ? Ah ! that is a good
</p>
<p>custom ; we have lost it. It is very unfortunate, more
</p>
<p>unfortunate than may be supposed."
</p>
<p>And Gaston d'Orle'ans had the confidence to speak in
</p>
<p>this tone nearly half an hour, with a young man whose
</p>
<p>serious character was not at all adapted to such conver-
</p>
<p>sation, and who, still occupied with the importance of
</p>
<p>the scenp he had just witnessed and the great interests
</p>
<p>which had been discussed, made no answer to this
</p>
<p>torrent of idle words. He looked at the Due de Bouillon
</p>
<p>with an astonished air, as if to ask him whether this

</p>
<p>appearing to perceive that he remained unanswered,
</p>
<p>replied to himself, speaking with volubility, as he drew
</p>
<p>him gradually out of the room. He feared that one of
</p>
<p>the gentlemen present might recommence the terrible
</p>
<p>conversation about the treaty ; but none desired to do
</p>
<p>so, unless it were the Due de Bouillon, who, however,
</p>
<p>preserved an angry silence. As for Cinq-Mars, he had

<p>been led away by De Thou, under cover of the chatter-

</p>
<p>DE THOU had reached home with his friend ; his doors
</p>
<p>were carefully shut, and orders given to admit no one,
</p>
<p>and to excuse him to the refugees for allowing them to
</p>
<p>depart without seeing them again ; and as yet the two
</p>
<p>friends had not spoken to each other.
</p>
<p>The counsellor had thrown himself into his armchair
</p>
<p>in deep meditation. Cinq-Mars, seated in the tall chim-
</p>
<p>ney-place, awaited with a serious and sorrowful air the
</p>
<p>termination of this silence. At length De Thou, looking
</p>
<p>fixedly at him and crossing his arms, said in a hollow
</p>
<p>and melancholy voice,
</p>
<p>" This, then, is what you have come to ! these, then,
</p>
<p>are the results of your ambition ! You are about to
</p>
<p>banish, perhaps to slay a man, and to bring a foreign
</p>
<p>army into France ; I am, then, to see you an assassin

</p>
<p>and a traitor to your country ! By what paths have you
</p>
<p>70 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>arrived thus far ? By what degrees have you descended
</p>
<p>so low ?"
</p>
<p>" Any other than yourself would not speak thus to me
</p>
<p>twice," said Cinq-Mars, coldly ; " but I know you, and
</p>
<p>I like this explanation. I desired it, and sought it. You
</p>
<p>shall see my entire soul. I had at first another thought,
</p>
<p>a better one perhaps, more worthy of our friendship,
</p>
<p>more worthy of friendship, friendship, the second thing
</p>
<p>upon earth."
</p>
<p>He raised his eyes to heaven as he spoke, as if he
</p>
<p>there sought this divinity.
</p>
<p>" Yes, it would have been better. I intended to have
</p>
<p>said nothing to you on this subject. It was a painful
</p>
<p>task to keep that silence ; but hitherto I have succeeded.
</p>
<p>I wished to have conducted the whole enterprise without
</p>
<p>you ; to show you only the finished work. I wished to
</p>
<p>keep you out of the circle of my danger ; but shall I con-
</p>
<p>fess my weakness ? I feared to die, if I have to die,
</p>
<p>misjudged by you. I can well endure the idea of the
</p>
<p>world's malediction, but not of yours ; but this has de-
</p>
<p>cided me upon avowing all to you."
</p>
<p>" What ! and but for this thought, you would have
</p>
<p>had the courage to conceal yourself forever from me ?
</p>
<p>Ah, dear Henri, what had I done that you should take
</p>
<p>this care of my life ? By what fault have I merited to
</p>
<p>survive you, if you die ? You have had the strength of
</p>
<p>mind to deceive me during two whole years ; you have
</p>
<p>never presented to me aught of your life but its flowers ;
</p>
<p>you have never entered my solitude but with a joyous
</p>
<p>countenance, and each time with a fresh favor. Ah, you

</p>
<p>must be very guilty or very virtuous!"
</p>
<p>THE SECRET. 71
</p>
<p>" Do not seek in my soul more than it contains. Yes,
</p>
<p>I have deceived you ; and therein was the only tranquil
</p>
<p>joy I had in the world. Forgive me for having stolen
</p>
<p>these moments from my destiny, so brilliant, alas ! I
</p>
<p>was happy in the happiness you supposed me to enjoy ;
</p>
<p>I made you happy in that dream, and I am only guilty
</p>
<p>now that I am about to destroy it, and to show myself
</p>
<p>as I was. Listen : I shall not detain you long ; the story
</p>
<p>of an impassioned heart is ever simple. Once before, I
</p>
<p>remember, in my tent when I was wounded, my secret
</p>
<p>had nearly escaped me ; it would have been happy, per-
</p>
<p>haps, had it done so. Yet what would counsel have
</p>
<p>availed me ? I should not have adopted it. In a word,
</p>
<p>'tis Marie de Gonzaga whom I love."
</p>
<p>" How ! she who is to be Queen of Poland ? "
</p>
<p>" If she is queen, it can only be after my death. But
</p>
<p>listen : for her I became a courtier ; for her I have al-
</p>
<p>most reigned in France ; and for her I am about to fall
</p>
<p>perhaps to die."
</p>
<p>" Die ! fall ! when I have been reproaching your tri-
</p>
<p>umph ! when I have wept over the sadness of your
</p>
<p>victory ! "
</p>
<p>" Ah ! you but ill know me if you suppose that I
</p>
<p>should be the dupe of Fortune, when she smiles upon
</p>
<p>me ; if you suppose that I have not seen to the bottom
</p>
<p>of my destiny ! I struggle against it, but 't is the
</p>
<p>stronger I feel it. I have undertaken a task beyond
</p>
<p>human power; and I shall fail in it."
</p>
<p>" Why, then, not stop ? What is the use of intellect
</p>
<p>in the business of the world ? "

<p>" None ; unless indeed it be to tell us the cause of our
</p>
<p>72 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>fall, and to enable us to foresee the day on which we
</p>
<p>shall fall. I cannot now recede. When a man is con-
</p>
<p>fronted with such an enemy as Richelieu, he must over-
</p>
<p>come him or be crushed by him. To-morrow I shall
</p>
<p>strike the last blow ; did I not just now, in your pres-
</p>
<p>ence, engage to do so ? "
</p>
<p>" And it is that very engagement that I would oppose.
</p>
<p>What confidence have you in those to whom you thus
</p>
<p>abandon your life ? Have you not read their secret
</p>
<p>thoughts ? "
</p>
<p>" I know them all ; I have read their hopes through
</p>
<p>their feigned rage ; I know that they tremble while they
</p>
<p>threaten. I know that even now they are ready to make
</p>
<p>their peace by giving me up ; but it is my part to sus-
</p>
<p>tain them and to decide the king. I must do it, for
</p>
<p>Marie is my betrothed, and my death is written at Nar-
</p>
<p>bonne. It is voluntarily, it is with a full knowledge of
</p>
<p>my fate, that I have thus placed myself between the
</p>
<p>scaffold and supreme happiness. That happiness I must
</p>
<p>tear from the hands of Fortune, or die on that scaffold.
</p>
<p>At this instant I experience the joy of having broken
</p>
<p>through all doubt. What ! blush you not at having
</p>
<p>thought me ambitious from a base egoism, like this car-
</p>
<p>dinal, ambitious from a puerile desire for a power which
</p>
<p>is never satisfied ? I am ambitious, but it is because I
</p>
<p>love. Yes, I love ; and in that word all is comprised.
</p>
<p>But I accuse you unjustly. You have embellished my
</p>
<p>secret intentions ; you have imparted to me noble de-
</p>
<p>signs (I remember them), high political conceptions.
</p>
<p>They are brilliant, they are grand, doubtless ; but shall

<p>I say it to you ? those vague projects for the perfection-
</p>
<p>THE SECRET. 73
</p>
<p>ating of corrupt societies seem to me to crawl far below
</p>
<p>the devotion of love. When the whole soul vibrates full
</p>
<p>of that one thought, it has no room for the nice calcula-
</p>
<p>tion of general interests ; the topmost heights of the
</p>
<p>earth are far beneath heaven."
</p>
<p>De Thou shook his head.
</p>
<p>" What can I answer ? " he said. " I do not under-
</p>
<p>stand you ; your reasoning unreasons you. You hunt a
</p>
<p>shadow."
</p>
<p>" Ay," continued Cinq- Mars ; " far from destroying
</p>
<p>my strength, this inward fire has developed it. I have
</p>
<p>calculated everything. A slow course has led me to
</p>
<p>the end which I am about to attain. Marie held me by
</p>
<p>the hand ; could I retreat ? I would not have done it
</p>
<p>though a world faced me. Hitherto, all has gone well ;
</p>
<p>but an invisible barrier arrests me. This barrier must
</p>
<p>be broken ; it is Richelieu. I but now in your presence
</p>
<p>undertook to do this ; but perhaps I was too hasty. I
</p>
<p>now think I was so. Let him rejoice ; he expected me.
</p>
<p>Doubtless he foresaw that it would be the youngest
</p>
<p>whose patience would first fail. If he played on this
</p>
<p>calculation, he played well. Yet, but for the love that
</p>
<p>has precipitated me on, I should have been stronger
</p>
<p>than he, and by just means."
</p>
<p>Then a sudden change came over the face of Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars. He turned pale and red twice ; and the veins
</p>
<p>of his forehead rose like blue lines drawn by an invis-
</p>
<p>ible hand.
</p>
<p>"Yes," he added, rising, and clasping together his
</p>

<p>can tear its victims I have in my breast. This timid

<p>girl, for whom I would shake empires, for whom I have
</p>
<p>suffered all, even the favor of a prince, who perhaps
</p>
<p>has not felt all I have done for her, cannot yet be mine.
</p>
<p>She is mine before God, yet I am estranged from her ;
</p>
<p>nay, I must hear daily discussed before me which of the
</p>
<p>thrones of Europe will best suit her, in conversations
</p>
<p>wherein I may not even raise my voice to give an opin-
</p>
<p>ion, and in which they scorn for her princes of the blood
</p>
<p>royal, who yet have precedence far before me. I must
</p>
<p>conceal myself like a culprit to hear through a grating
</p>
<p>the voice of her who is my wife ; in public I must bow
</p>
<p>before her, her husband, yet her servant ! 'T is too
</p>
<p>much ; I cannot live thus. I must take the last step,
</p>
<p>whether it raise me or hurl me down."
</p>
<p>" And for your personal happiness you would overthrow
</p>
<p>a State?"
</p>
<p>"The happiness of the State concurs with mine. I
</p>
<p>secure that undoubtedly in destroying the tyrant of the
</p>
<p>king. The horror with which this man inspires me has
</p>
<p>passed into my very blood. When I was first on my way
</p>
<p>to him, I encountered in my journey his greatest crime.
</p>
<p>He is the genius of evil for the unhappy king ! I will ex-
</p>
<p>orcise him. I might have become the genius of good
</p>
<p>for Louis XIII. It was one of the thoughts of Marie,
</p>
<p>her most cherished thought. But I do not think I shall
</p>
<p>triumph in the uneasy soul of the prince."
</p>
<p>" Upon what do you rely, then ? " said De Thou.
</p>
<p>" Upon the cast of a die. If his will can this once
</p>
<p>last for a few hours, I have gained. 'T is a last calcu-

</p>
<p>" And that of your Marie ! "
</p>
<p>" Could you suppose it ? " said Cinq-Mars, impetu-
</p>
<p>ously. " No, no ! If he abandons me, I sign the treaty
</p>
<p>of Spain, and then war ! "
</p>
<p>" Ah, horror ! " exclaimed the counsellor. " What, a
</p>
<p>war ! 'a civil war, and a foreign alliance ! "
</p>
<p>" Ay, 't is a crime," said Cinq-Mars, coldly ; " but have
</p>
<p>I asked you to participate in it ? "
</p>
<p>" Cruel, ungrateful man ! " replied his friend ; " can
</p>
<p>you speak to me thus ? Know you not, have I not
</p>
<p>proved to you, that friendship holds the place of every
</p>
<p>passion in my heart ? Can I survive the least of your
</p>
<p>misfortunes, far less your death ? Still, let me influence
</p>
<p>you not to strike France. Oh, my friend ! my only
</p>
<p>friend ! I implore you on my knees, let us not thus be
</p>
<p>parricides; let us not assassinate our country \ I say

</p>
<p>labored so long; sully not my life and my death, which
</p>
<p>I have devoted to you."
</p>
<p>De Thou had fallen at the feet of his friend, who,
</p>
<p>unable to preserve his affected coldness, threw himself
</p>
<p>into his arms, as he raised him, and pressing him to his
</p>
<p>heart, said in a stifled voice,
</p>
<p>" Why love me thus ? What have you done, friend ?
</p>
<p>Why love me ? You who are wise, pure, and virtuous ;
</p>
<p>you who are not led away by an insensate passion and
</p>
<p>the desire for vengeance ; you whose soul is nourished
</p>
<p>only by religion and science, why love me ? What has

</p>
<p>me ; we are no longer of the same nature. You see
</p>
<p>courts have corrupted me. I have no longer openness,
</p>
<p>no longer goodness. I meditate the ruin of a man ; I
</p>
<p>can deceive a friend. Forget me, scorn me. I am not
</p>
<p>worthy of one of your thoughts ; how should I be worthy
</p>
<p>of your perils ? "
</p>
<p>"By swearing to me not to betray the king and
</p>
<p>France," answered De Thou. " Know you that the pres-
</p>
<p>ervation of your country is at stake ; that if you yield
</p>
<p>to Spain our fortifications, she will never return them to
</p>
<p>you ; that your name will be a horror to posterity ; that
</p>
<p>French mothers will curse it when they shall be forced
</p>
<p>to teach their children a foreign language, know you
</p>
<p>all this? Come."
</p>
<p>And he drew him towards the bust of Louis XIII.
</p>
<p>" Swear before him (he is your friend also), swear
</p>
<p>never to sign this infamous treaty."
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars lowered his eyes, but with inflexible tena-
</p>
<p>city answered, although he blushed as he did so,
</p>
<p>" I have said it ; if they force me to it, I will
</p>
<p>sign."
</p>
<p>De Thou turned pale, and let fall his hand. He took
</p>
<p>two turns in his room, his arms crossed, in inexpressible
</p>
<p>anguish. At last he advanced solemnly towards the
</p>
<p>bust of his father, and opened a large book standing at
</p>
<p>its foot ; he turned to a page already marked, and read
</p>
<p>aloud :
</p>

</p>
<p>Then keeping the book respectfully opened in his
</p>
<p>hand, and contemplating the image of the President de
</p>
<p>Thou, whose "Memoirs" he held, he continued,
</p>
<p>"Yes, my father, you thought well. I shall be a
</p>
<p>criminal, I shall merit death ; but can I do otherwise ?
</p>
<p>I will not denounce this traitor, because that also would
</p>
<p>be treason ; and he is my friend, and he is unhappy."
</p>
<p>Then advancing towards Cinq-Mars, and again taking
</p>
<p>his hand, he said,
</p>
<p>" I do much for you in acting thus ; but expect
</p>
<p>nothing further from me, sir, if you sign this treaty."
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars was moved to the heart's core by this
</p>
<p>scene, for he felt all that his friend must suffer in cast-
</p>
<p>ing him off. Checking, however, the tears which were
</p>
<p>rising to his smarting lids, and embracing De Thou
</p>
<p>tenderly, he exclaimed,
</p>
<p>" Ah, De Thou, I find you still perfect. Yes, you do

<p>THE HUNTING PARTY.

<p>On a bien de graces a rendre & son etoile quand on peut quitter
</p>
<p>les hommes sans etre oblige de leur faire du mal et de se declarer
</p>
<p>leur ennemi. CH. NODIER, Jean Sbogar.
</p>
<p>MEANWHILE the illness of the king threw France into
</p>
<p>a consternation which unsettled States ever feel on the
</p>
<p>approach of the death of princes. Although Richelieu
</p>
<p>was the centre of the monarchy, he only reigned in the
</p>
<p>name of Louis XIII., and as enveloped with the splendor
</p>
<p>of that name which he had aggrandized. Absolute as
</p>
<p>he was over his master, he still feared him ; and this
</p>
<p>fear reassured the nation against his ambitious desires,
</p>
<p>of which the king himself was the fixed barrier. But
</p>
<p>this prince dead, what would the imperious minister do ?
</p>
<p>Where would that man stop who had already dared so
</p>
<p>much ? Accustomed to wield the sceptre, who would
</p>
<p>prevent him from still bearing it, and from inscribing
</p>
<p>his name alone at the foot of the laws which he alone

</p>
<p>should dictate ? These terrors agitated all minds. The
</p>
<p>THE HUNTING PARTY. 79
</p>
<p>people in vain looked throughout the kingdom for those
</p>
<p>colossuses of the nobility, at the feet of whom it had
</p>
<p>been wont to find shelter in political storms. It now
</p>
<p>only saw their recent tombs. The parliaments were
</p>
<p>dumb ; and men felt that nothing could be opposed to
</p>
<p>the monstrous growth of this usurping power. No one
</p>
<p>was entirely deceived by the affected sufferings of the
</p>
<p>minister. None were touched with that feigned agony
</p>
<p>which had too often deceived the public hope ; and dis-
</p>
<p>tance nowhere prevented the weight of the finger of the
</p>
<p>dreaded parvenu from being felt.
</p>
<p>The love of the people soon revived towards the son
</p>
<p>of Henri IV. They hastened to the churches ; they
</p>
<p>prayed, and often even wept. Unfortunate princes are
</p>
<p>always loved. The melancholy of Louis, and his myste-
</p>
<p>rious sorrow, interested all France ; and still living, they
</p>
<p>already regretted him. as if each man had wished to
</p>
<p>have been the depositary of his troubles ere he carried
</p>
<p>away with him the grand secret of what is suffered by
</p>
<p>the men placed so high that they can see nothing before
</p>
<p>them but their tomb.
</p>
<p>The king, wishing to reassure the whole nation, an-
</p>
<p>nounced the temporary re-establishment of his health,
</p>
<p>and ordered the court to prepare for a grand hunting
</p>
<p>party to be given at Chambord, a royal domain,
</p>
<p>whither his brother, the Due d'Orleans, prayed him to
</p>
<p>return.
</p>
<p>This beautiful abode was the favorite retreat of the
</p>
<p>king, doubtless because, in harmony with his feelings,
</p>
<p>it combined grandeur with sadness. He often passed

<p>whole months there, without seeing any one whatsoever,
</p>
<p>80 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>incessantly reading and re-reading mysterious papers,
</p>
<p>writing unknown matters, which he locked up in an iron
</p>
<p>coffer, of which he alone had the key. He sometimes
</p>
<p>delighted in being served by a single domestic, and thus
</p>
<p>so forget himself by the absence of his suite as to live
</p>
<p>for many days together like a poor man or an exiled
</p>
<p>citizen, loving to figure to himself misery or persecution,
</p>
<p>in order the better to enjoy royalty afterwards. Another
</p>
<p>time he would be in a more entire solitude ; and having
</p>
<p>forbidden any human creature to approach him, clothed
</p>
<p>in the habit of a monk, he would shut himself up in the
</p>
<p>vaulted chapel. There, reading the life of Charles V.,
</p>
<p>he would imagine himself at St. Just, and chant over
</p>
<p>himself that Mass for the dead which brought death
</p>
<p>upon the head of the Spanish monarch. But in the
</p>
<p>midst of these very chants and meditations, his feeble
</p>
<p>mind was pursued and distracted by contrary images.
</p>
<p>Never did life and the world appear to him more fair
</p>
<p>than in solitude among the tombs. Between his eyes
</p>
<p>and the page which he endeavored to read passed bril-
</p>
<p>liant processions, victorious armies, or nations trans-
</p>
<p>ported with love. He saw himself powerful, combating,
</p>
<p>triumphant, adored ; and if a ray of the sun through the
</p>
<p>large windows fell upon him, suddenly rising from the
</p>
<p>foot of the altar, he felt himself carried away by a thirst
</p>
<p>for daylight and the open air, which led him from his
</p>
<p>gloomy retreat. But returned to real life, he found
</p>
<p>there once more disgust and ennui, for the first men
</p>
<p>he met recalled his power to his recollection by their
</p>
<p>homage. It was then that he believed in friendship,

</p>
<p>and called it to his side ; but scarcely was he certain of
</p>
<p>THE HUNTING PARTY. 81
</p>
<p>its possession than an unconquerable scruple suddenly
</p>
<p>seized upon his soul. It was that of a too powerful at-
</p>
<p>tachment to the creature, turning him from the Creator,
</p>
<p>or more frequently an inward reproach for removing
</p>
<p>himself too much from the affairs of the State. The
</p>
<p>object of his momentary affection then seemed to him
</p>
<p>a despotic being, whose power drew him from his
</p>
<p>duties ; but unfortunately for his favorites, he had not
</p>
<p>the strength of mind outwardly to manifest towards
</p>
<p>them the resentment he felt, and thus to warn them of
</p>
<p>their danger, but continuing to caress them, added by
</p>
<p>this constraint fuel to the secret fire of his heart, and
</p>
<p>was impelled to absolute hatred of them. There w T ere
</p>
<p>moments when he was capable of going to any lengths
</p>
<p>against them.
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars perfectly knew the weakness of that mind,
</p>
<p>which could not keep firmly in any path, and the weak-
</p>
<p>ness of that heart, which could neither wholly love nor
</p>
<p>wholly hate. Thus the position of favorite, the envy
</p>
<p>of all France, the object of jealousy even on the part
</p>
<p>of the great minister, was so precarious and so painful
</p>
<p>that but for his love, he would have burst his golden
</p>
<p>chains with greater joy than a galley-slave feels when
</p>
<p>he sees the last ring that for two long years he has been
</p>
<p>filing with a steel spring concealed in his mouth, fall to
</p>
<p>the earth. This impatience to meet the fate he saw so
</p>
<p>near, hastened the explosion of that patiently excavated
</p>
<p>mine, as he had declared to his friend ; but his situation
</p>
<p>was then that of a man who, placed by the side of the
</p>
<p>book of life, should see passing over it the hand which
</p>
<p>is to trace out his damnation or his salvation. He set

</p>
<p>out with Louis to Chambord, resolved to take the first
</p>
<p>opportunity favorable to his design. It soon presented
</p>
<p>itself.
</p>
<p>The very morning of the day appointed for the chase,
</p>
<p>the king sent word to him that he was waiting for him
</p>
<p>on the Escalier du Lys. It may not, perhaps, be profit-
</p>
<p>less to speak of this astonishing construction.
</p>
<p>Four leagues from Blois, and one league from the
</p>
<p>Loire, in a small and very deep valley, between marshy
</p>
<p>swamps and a wood of large oaks, far from any high-
</p>
<p>road, the traveller suddenly comes upon a royal, or
</p>
<p>rather magic castle. It might be said that compelled by
</p>
<p>some wonderful lamp, a genie of the East had carried it
</p>
<p>off during one of the " thousand and one nights," and
</p>
<p>had brought it from the country of the sun to conceal
</p>
<p>it in the land of fogs and mist, as the abode of the mis-
</p>
<p>tress of a handsome prince. This palace is hidden like
</p>
<p>a treasure ; but with its blue domes, its elegant minarets
</p>
<p>rising from thick walls or shooting into the air, its long
</p>
<p>terraces overlooking the wood, its light spires waving
</p>
<p>with the wind, its crescents everywhere rising over its
</p>
<p>colonnades, one might imagine one's self in the kingdom
</p>
<p>of Bagdad or of Cachmire, did not their blackened walls,
</p>
<p>with their covering of moss and ivy, and the pallid and
</p>
<p>melancholy hue of the sky, denote a rainy climate. It
</p>
<p>was indeed a genius who raised this building ; but he
</p>
<p>came from Italy, and his name was Primaticcio. It was
</p>
<p>indeed a handsome prince whose amours were concealed
</p>
<p>in it ; but he was a king, and he was named FranQois I.
</p>
<p>His Salamander still spouts fire everywhere about it.

<p>It sparkles in a thousand places on the arched roofs,
</p>
<p>THE HUNTING PARTY, 83
</p>
<p>and multiplies the flames there like the stars of heaven ;
</p>
<p>it supports the capitals with its burning crown ; it colors
</p>
<p>the windows with its fires; it meanders up and down
</p>
<p>the secret staircases, and everywhere seems to devour
</p>
<p>with its flaming glances the triple crescent of a mysteri-
</p>
<p>ous Diane, that Diane de Poitiers, twice a goddess and
</p>
<p>twice adored in these voluptuous woods.
</p>
<p>The base of this strange monument is like the monu-
</p>
<p>ment itself, full of elegance and mystery ; there is a
</p>
<p>double staircase, which rises in two interwoven spirals
</p>
<p>from the most remote foundations of the edifice up to
</p>
<p>the highest points, and ends in a lantern or small lattice-
</p>
<p>work cabinet, surmounted by a colossal fleur-de-lis, visi-
</p>
<p>ble from a great distance. Two men may ascend it at
</p>
<p>the same moment, without seeing each other.
</p>
<p>This staircase alone seems like a little isolated temple.
</p>
<p>Like our churches, it is sustained and protected by the
</p>
<p>arcades of its thin, light, transparent, open-work wings.
</p>
<p>One would think the docile stone had given itself to the
</p>
<p>finger of the architect ; it seems, so to speak, kneaded
</p>
<p>according to the slightest caprice of his imagination.
</p>
<p>One can hardly conceive how the plans were traced, in
</p>
<p>what terms the orders were explained to the workmen.
</p>
<p>The whole thing appears a transient thought, a brilliant
</p>
<p>revery that at once assumed a durable form, the reali-
</p>
<p>zation of a dream.
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars was slowly ascending the broad stairs
</p>
<p>whicli led him to the king's presence, and stopping
</p>
<p>longer at each step, in proportion as he approached him,

<p>whose daily complaints he had to listen to, or thinking
</p>
<p>84 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>of what he was about to do. when the sound of a guitar
</p>
<p>struck his ear. He recognized the beloved instrument
</p>
<p>of Louis and his sad, feeble, and trembling voice faintly
</p>
<p>re-echoing from the vaulted ceiling. Louis seemed trying
</p>
<p>one of those romances which he was wont to com-
</p>
<p>pose, and several times repeated an incomplete strain
</p>
<p>with a trembling hand. The words could scarcely be
</p>
<p>distinguished ; all that Cinq-Mars heard were a few such
</p>
<p>as Abandon, ennui du monde, et belle flamme.
</p>
<p>The young favorite shrugged his shoulders as he
</p>
<p>listened.
</p>
<p>" What new chagrin moves thee ? " he said. " Come,
</p>
<p>let me again attempt to read that chilled heart which
</p>
<p>thinks it needs something."
</p>
<p>He entered the narrow cabinet.
</p>
<p>Clothed in black, half reclining on a couch, his elbows
</p>
<p>resting upon pillows, the prince was languidly touching
</p>
<p>the chords of his guitar; he ceased this when he saw
</p>
<p>the grand e*cuyer enter, and raising his large eyes to him
</p>
<p>with an air of reproach, swayed his head to and fro for
</p>
<p>a long time without speaking. Then in a plaintive but
</p>
<p>emphatic tone he said,
</p>
<p>" What do I hear, Cinq-Mars ? What do I hear of your
</p>
<p>conduct ? How much do you pain me by forgetting all
</p>
<p>my counsels ! You have formed a guilty intrigue ; was
</p>
<p>it from you I was to expect such things, you whom I so
</p>

</p>
<p>Full of his political projects, Cinq-Mars thought him-

<p>self discovered, and could not help a momentary anxiety ;

<p>but, perfectly master of himself, he answered without

<p>THE HUNTING PARTY. 85
</p>
<p>" Yes, Sire ; and I was about to declare it to you, for I
</p>
<p>am accustomed to open my soul to you."
</p>
<p>" Declare it to me ! " exclaimed the king, turning red
</p>
<p>and white, as under the shivering of a fever ; " and you
</p>
<p>dare to contaminate my ears with these horrible avowals,
</p>
<p>sir, and to speak so calmly of your disorder ! Go ! you
</p>
<p>deserve to be condemned to the galley, like Rondin ; it
</p>
<p>is a crime of high treason you have committed in your
</p>
<p>want of faith towards me. I had rather you were a
</p>
<p>coiner, like the Marquis de Coucy, or at the head of the
</p>
<p>Croquants, than do as you have done; you dishonor
</p>
<p>your family, and the memory of the marechal your
</p>
<p>father."
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars, deeming himself wholly lost, put the best
</p>
<p>face he could upon the matter, and said with an air of
</p>
<p>resignation,
</p>
<p>"Well, then, Sire, send me to be judged and put to
</p>
<p>death ; but spare me your reproaches."
</p>
<p>" Do you insult me, you petty country-squire ? " an-
</p>
<p>swered Louis. " I know very well that you have not
</p>
<p>incurred the penalty of death in the eyes of men ; but it
</p>
<p>is at the tribunal of God, sir, that you will be judged."
</p>
<p>" Heavens, Sire ! " replied the impetuous young man,
</p>
<p>whom the insulting phrase of the king had offended,
</p>
<p>" why do you not allow me to return to the province you
</p>
<p>so much despise, as I have sought to do a hundred times ?
</p>
<p>I will go there. I cannot support the life I lead with
</p>
<p>you ; an angel could not bear it. Once more, let me be
</p>
<p>judged if I am guilty, or allow me to return to Touraine.
</p>
<p>It is you who have ruined me in attaching me to your

<p>person. If you have caused me to conceive lofty hopes,
</p>
<p>86 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>which you afterwards overthrew, is that my fault ?
</p>
<p>Wherefore have you made me grand e"cuyer, if I was
</p>
<p>not to rise higher ? In a word, am I your friend or not ?
</p>
<p>and, if I am, why may I not be due, peer, or even eon-
</p>
<p>stable, as well as M. de Luynes, whom you loved so much
</p>
<p>because he trained falcons for you ? Why am I not ad-
</p>
<p>mitted to the council ? I could speak as well as any of
</p>
<p>the old ruffs there ; I have new ideas, and a better arm
</p>
<p>to serve you. It is your cardinal who has prevented
</p>
<p>you from summoning me there. And it is because he
</p>
<p>keeps you from me that I detest him," continued Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars, clinching his fist, as if Richelieu stood before
</p>
<p>him ; " yes, I would kill him with my own hand, if need
</p>
<p>were."
</p>
<p>D'Effiat's eyes were inflamed with anger ; he stamped
</p>
<p>his foot as he spoke, and turned his back to the king,
</p>
<p>like a sulky child, leaning against one of the columns
</p>
<p>of the cupola.
</p>
<p>Louis, who recoiled before all resolution, and who was
</p>
<p>always terrified by the irreparable, took his hand.
</p>
<p>weakness of power ! caprices of the human
</p>
<p>heart! it was by this childish impetuosity, these very
</p>
<p>defects of his age, that this young man governed the
</p>
<p>King of France as effectually as did the first politician
</p>
<p>of the time. This prince believed, and with some show
</p>
<p>of reason, that a character so hasty must be sincere ;
</p>
<p>and even his fiery rage did not anger him. It did not
</p>
<p>apply to the real subject of his reproaches, and he could
</p>
<p>well pardon him for hating the cardinal. The very idea
</p>
<p>of his favorite's jealousy of the minister pleased him,

<p>because it indicated attachment; and all he dreaded was

</p>
<p>his indifference. Cinq-Mars knew this, and had desired
</p>
<p>to make it a means of escape, preparing the king to re-
</p>
<p>gard all that he had done as child's play, as the conse-
</p>
<p>quence of his friendship for him; but the danger was
</p>
<p>not so great, and he breathed freely when the prince
</p>
<p>said to him,
</p>
<p>" The cardinal is not in question here. I love him no
</p>
<p>more than you do ; but it is with your scandalous con-
</p>
<p>duct I reproach you, and which I shall have much diffi-
</p>
<p>culty to pardon in you. What, sir ! I learn that instead
</p>
<p>of devoting yourself to the pious exercises to which I
</p>
<p>have accustomed you, when I fancy you are at your
</p>
<p>Salut or your Angelus, you are off from St. Germain,
</p>
<p>and go to pass a portion of the night with whom ?
</p>
<p>Dare I speak of it without sin ? With a woman lost in
</p>
<p>reputation, who can have no relations with you but such
</p>
<p>as are pernicious to the safety of your soul, and who
</p>
<p>receives free-thinkers at her house, in a word, Marion
</p>
<p>de Lorme. What have you to say ? Speak."
</p>
<p>Leaving his hand in that of the king, but still leaning
</p>
<p>against the column, Cinq-Mars answered,
</p>
<p>" Is it then so culpable to leave grave occupations for
</p>
<p>others more serious still ? If I go to the house of Marion
</p>
<p>de Lorme, it is to hear the conversation of the learned
</p>
<p>men who assemble there. Nothing is more harmless
</p>
<p>than these meetings. Readings are given there which,
</p>
<p>it is true, sometimes extend far into the night, but
</p>
<p>which commonly tend to exalt the soul, so far from
</p>
<p>corrupting it. Besides, you have never commanded me
</p>
<p>to account to you for all that I do ; I should have in-

</p>
<p>88 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" Ah, Cinq-Mars, Cinq-Mars ! where is your confi-
</p>
<p>dence ? Do you feel no need of it ? It is the first con-
</p>
<p>dition of a perfect friendship, such as ours ought to be,
</p>
<p>such as my heart requires."
</p>
<p>The voice of Louis became more affectionate, and the
</p>
<p>favorite, looking at him over his shoulder, assumed an
</p>
<p>air less angry, but still simply ennuyg, and resigned to
</p>
<p>listening to him.
</p>
<p>" How often have you deceived me ! " continued the
</p>
<p>king ; " can I trust myself to you ? Are they not fops
</p>
<p>and gallants whom you meet at the house of this
</p>
<p>woman ? Do not courtesans go there ? "
</p>
<p>" Heavens ! no, Sire ; I often go there with one of
</p>
<p>my friends, a gentleman of Touraine, named Rene
</p>
<p>Descartes."
</p>
<p>" Descartes ! I know that name ! Yes, he is an officer
</p>
<p>who distinguished himself at the siege of Rochelle, and
</p>
<p>who dabbles in writing ; he has a good reputation for
</p>
<p>piety, but he is connected with Desbarreaux, who is a
</p>
<p>free-thinker. I am sure that you must mix with many
</p>
<p>persons who are not fit company for you, many young
</p>
<p>men without family, without birth. Come, tell me
</p>
<p>whom saw you last there ? "
</p>
<p>" Truly, I can scarcely remember their names," said
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars, looking at the ceiling ; " sometimes I do not
</p>
<p>even ask them. There was, in the first place, a certain
</p>
<p>M. M. Groot, or Grotius, a Hollander."
</p>
<p>" I know him, a friend of Barnevelt ; I pay him a pen-
</p>
<p>sion. I liked him well enough ; but the card but I
</p>
<p>was told that he was a high Calvinist."

</p>
<p>" I also saw an Englishman, named John Milton ; he
</p>
<p>THE HUNTING PARTY. 89
</p>
<p>is a young man just come from Italy, and is returning
</p>
<p>to London. He scarcely speaks at all."
</p>
<p>" I don't know him, not at all ; but I'm sure he 's
</p>
<p>some other Calvinist. And the Frenchmen, who were
</p>
<p>they?"
</p>
<p>" The young man who wrote ' China,' and who has
</p>
<p>been thrice rejected at the Academic fiminente ; he was
</p>
<p>angry that Du Ryer occupied his place there. He is
</p>
<p>called Corneille."
</p>
<p>" Well," said the king, folding his arms, and looking
</p>
<p>at him with an air of triumph and reproach, " I ask you
</p>
<p>who are these people ? Is it in such a circle that you
</p>
<p>ought to be seen ? "
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars was confounded at this observation, which
</p>
<p>hurt his self-pride, and approaching the king, he said,
</p>
<p>" You are right, Sire ; but there can be no harm in
</p>
<p>passing an hour or two in listening to good conversa-
</p>
<p>tion. Besides, many courtiers go there, such as the Due
</p>
<p>de Bouillon, M. d'Aubijoux, the Comte de Brion, the
</p>
<p>Cardinal de la Vallette, MM. de Montre'sor, Fontrailles ;
</p>
<p>men illustrious in the sciences, as Mairet, Colletet, Des-
</p>
<p>marets, author of ' Araine ; ' Faret, Doujat, Charpentier,
</p>
<p>who wrote the ' Cyrope"die ; ' Giry, Besons, and Baro,
</p>
<p>the continuer of ' Astre'e,' all academicians."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! now, indeed, here are men of real merit," said
</p>
<p>Louis ; " there is nothing to be said against them. One
</p>
<p>cannot but gain from their society. Theirs are settled
</p>
<p>reputations ; they 're men of weight. Come, let us make
</p>
<p>up ; shake hands, child. I permit you to go there
</p>
<p>sometimes, but do not deceive me any more ; you see I

<p>know all. Look at this."
</p>
<p>90 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>So saying, the king took from a great iron chest set
</p>
<p>against the wall enormous packets of paper scribbled
</p>
<p>over with very fine writing. Upon one was written,
</p>
<p>Baradas, upon another, D'Hautefort, upon a third, La
</p>
<p>Fayette, and finally, Cinq-Mars. He stopped at the
</p>
<p>latter, and continued,
</p>
<p>" See how many times you have deceived me ! These
</p>
<p>are the continual faults of which I have myself kept a
</p>
<p>register during the two years I have known you ; I have
</p>
<p>written out our conversations day by day. Sit down."
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars obeyed with a sigh, and had the patience for
</p>
<p>two long hours to listen to a summary of what his mas-
</p>
<p>ter had had the patience to write in the course of two
</p>
<p>years. He yawned many times during the reading, as
</p>
<p>no doubt we should all do, were it needful to report this
</p>
<p>dialogue, which was found in perfect order, with his will,
</p>
<p>at the death of the king. We shall only say that he
</p>
<p>finished thus,
</p>
<p>" In fine, hear what you did on the 7th of December,
</p>
<p>three days ago. I was speaking to you of the flight of
</p>
<p>the hawk, and of the knowledge of hunting, in which
</p>
<p>you are deficient. I said to you on the authority of
</p>
<p>' La Chasse Royale,' a work of King Charles IX., that
</p>
<p>after the hunter has accustomed his dog to follow a
</p>
<p>beast, he must consider him as of himself desirous of
</p>
<p>returning to the wood, and the dog must not be rebuked
</p>
<p>or struck in order to make him follow the track well ;
</p>
<p>and that in order to teach a dog to set well, creatures
</p>
<p>that are not game must not be allowed to pass or run,
</p>
<p>nor must any scents be missed, without putting his nose

<p>THE HUNTING PARTY. 91
</p>
<p>" Hear what you replied to me (and in a tone of ill-
</p>
<p>humor mind that !), ' Ma foi ! Sire, give me rather
</p>
<p>regiments to conduct than birds and dogs. I am sure
</p>
<p>that people would laugh at you and me if they knew
</p>
<p>how we occupy ourselves.' And on the 8th wait, yes,
</p>
<p>on the 8th while we were singing vespers together in
</p>
<p>my chambers, you threw your book angrily into the fire,
</p>
<p>which was an impiety ; and afterwards you told me that
</p>
<p>you had let it drop, a sin, a mortal sin. See, I have
</p>
<p>written below, lie, underlined. People never deceive me,
</p>
<p>I assure you."
</p>
<p>" But, Sire "
</p>
<p>" Wait a moment ! wait a moment ! In the evening
</p>
<p>you told me the cardinal had burned a man unjustly,
</p>
<p>and out of personal hatred."
</p>
<p>" And I repeat it, and maintain it, and will prove it,
</p>
<p>Sire. It is the greatest crime of all of that man whom
</p>
<p>you hesitate to disgrace, and who renders you unhappy.
</p>
<p>I myself saw all, heard all, at Loudun. Urbain Gran-
</p>
<p>dier was assassinated rather than tried. Hold, Sire,
</p>
<p>since you have there all those memoranda in your own
</p>
<p>hand, merely reperuse the proofs which I then gave
</p>
<p>you of it."
</p>
<p>Louis, seeking the page indicated, and going back
</p>
<p>to the journey from Perpignan to Paris, read the whole
</p>
<p>narrative with attention, exclaiming,
</p>
<p>" What horrors ! How is it that I have forgotten all
</p>
<p>this? This man fascinates me ; that 's certain. You are
</p>
<p>my true friend, Cinq-Mars. What horrors ! My reign
</p>
<p>will be stained by them. What ! he prevented the let-

</p>
<p>reaching me ! Burn, burn alive ! without proofs ! for
</p>
<p>revenge ! A man, a people have invoked my name in
</p>
<p>vain ; a family curses me ! Oh, how unhappy are
</p>
<p>kings ! "
</p>
<p>And the prince, as he concluded, threw aside his
</p>
<p>papers and wept.
</p>
<p>" Ah, Sire, those are blessed tears that you weep ! "
</p>
<p>exclaimed Cinq-Mars, with sincere admiration. " Would
</p>
<p>that all France were here with me ! She would be
</p>
<p>astonished at this spectacle, and would scarcely be-
</p>
<p>lieve it."
</p>
<p>" Astonished ! France, then, does not know me ?"
</p>
<p>" No, sir," said D'Effiat, frankly ; " no one knows you.
</p>
<p>And I myself, with the rest of the world, at times
</p>
<p>accuse you of coldness and indifference."
</p>
<p>" Of coldness, when I am dying with sorrow ! Of
</p>
<p>coldness, when I have immolated myself to their inter-
</p>
<p>ests ! Ungrateful nation ! I have sacrificed all to it,
</p>
<p>even pride, even the happiness of guiding it myself, be-
</p>
<p>cause I feared on its account for my fluctuating life.
</p>
<p>I have given my sceptre to be borne by a man I hate,
</p>
<p>because I believed his hand to be stronger than my own.
</p>
<p>I have endured the ill he has done to myself, thinking
</p>
<p>that he did good to my people. I have hidden my own
</p>
<p>tears to dry theirs ; and I see that my sacrifice has been
</p>
<p>even greater than I thought it, for they have not per-
</p>
<p>ceived it. They have believed me incapable because I
</p>
<p>was kind, and without power because I mistrusted my
</p>
<p>own. But no matter ! God sees and knows me ! "
</p>
<p>" Ah, Sire, show yourself to France such as you are ;

</p>
<p>love what she would never do from fear. Return to
</p>
<p>life, and reascend the throne."
</p>
<p>" No, no ; my life is well-nigh finished, my dear
</p>
<p>friend. I am no longer capable of the labor of supreme
</p>
<p>command."
</p>
<p>" Ah, Sire, this persuasion alone destroys your vigor.
</p>
<p>It is time that men should cease to confound power with
</p>
<p>crime, and to call this union genius. Let your voice be
</p>
<p>heard proclaiming to the world that the reign of virtue
</p>
<p>is about to begin with your own ; and henceforth those
</p>
<p>enemies whom vice has so much difficulty in suppress-
</p>
<p>ing will fall before a word uttered from your heart.
</p>
<p>No one has as yet calculated all that the good faith of a
</p>
<p>king of France may do for his people, that people who
</p>
<p>are drawn so instantaneously towards all that is good
</p>
<p>and beautiful, by their imagination and warmth of soul,
</p>
<p>and who are always ready with every kind of devotion.
</p>
<p>The king your father led us by a smile. What would
</p>
<p>not one of your tears do?"
</p>
<p>During this address the king, very much surprised,
</p>
<p>frequently reddened, hemmed, and gave signs of great
</p>
<p>embarrassment, as always happened when any attempt
</p>
<p>was made to bring him to a decision. He also felt the
</p>
<p>approach of a conversation of too high an order, which
</p>
<p>the timidity of his soul forbade him to venture upon ;
</p>
<p>and repeatedly putting his hand to his chest, knitting
</p>
<p>his brows as if suffering violent pain, he endeavored to
</p>
<p>relieve himself by the apparent attack of illness from
</p>
<p>the embarrassment of answering. But either from pas-
</p>
<p>sion, or from a resolution to strike the crowning blow,

</p>
<p>awed Louis, who, forced into his last intrenchments, at
</p>
<p>length said,
</p>
<p>" But, Cinq-Mars, how can I rid myself of a minister
</p>
<p>who for eighteen years past has surrounded me with
</p>
<p>his creatures ? "
</p>
<p>" He is not so very powerful," replied the grand
</p>
<p>e*cuyer ; " and his friends will be his most sure enemies
</p>
<p>if you but make a sign of your head. The ancient
</p>
<p>league of the princes of peace still exists, Sire, and it is
</p>
<p>only the respect due to the choice of your Majesty that
</p>
<p>prevents it from manifesting itself."
</p>
<p>" Ah, man Dieu ! thou mayst tell them not to stop
</p>
<p>on my account. I would not restrain them ; they surely
</p>
<p>do not accuse me of being a Cardinalist. If my brother
</p>
<p>will give me the means of replacing Richelieu, I will
</p>
<p>adopt them with all my heart."
</p>
<p>" I believe, Sire, that he will to-day speak to you of
</p>
<p>M. le Due de Bouillon. All the Royalists demand
</p>
<p>him."
</p>
<p>" I don't dislike him," said the king, arranging his
</p>
<p>pillows ; " I don't dislike him at all, although he is
</p>
<p>somewhat factious. We are relatives. Knowest thou,
</p>
<p>cher ami" and he placed on this favorite expression
</p>
<p>more emphasis than usual, " knowest thou that he
</p>
<p>is descended in direct line from Saint Louis, by Char-
</p>
<p>lotte de Bourbon, daughter of the Due de Montpensier ?
</p>
<p>Knowest thou that seven princes of the blood royal have

</p>
<p>" "Well, Sire," said Cinq-Mars, with confidence, " Mon-
</p>
<p>sieur and he will explain to you during the hunt how
</p>
<p>all is prepared, who are the men that may be put in
</p>
<p>the place of his creatures, who the field-marshals and

<p>the colonels who may be depended upon against Fabert

<p>and the Cardinalists of Perpignan. You will see that

<p>" The queen, Monsieur, the nobility, and the parlia-
</p>
<p>ments are on our side ; and the thing is done from the
</p>
<p>moment that your Majesty is not opposed to it. It
</p>
<p>has been proposed to get rid of the cardinal as the
</p>
<p>Marechal d'Ancre was got rid of, who deserved it less
</p>
<p>than he."
</p>
<p>" As Concini ? " said the king. " Oh, no, it must not
</p>
<p>be. I positively cannot consent to it. He is a priest
</p>
<p>and a cardinal. We shall be excommunicated. But if
</p>
<p>there be any other means, I am very willing. Thou
</p>
<p>inayst speak of it to thy friends ; and I on my side
</p>
<p>will think of the matter."
</p>
<p>The word once spoken, the king gave himself up to
</p>
<p>his resentment, as if he had satisfied it, as if the blow
</p>
<p>were already struck. Cinq-Mars was vexed to see this,
</p>
<p>for he feared that his anger thus vented might not be
</p>
<p>of long duration. However, he put faith in his last
</p>
<p>words, especially when after numberless complaints
</p>
<p>Louis added,
</p>
<p>" And would you believe that though now for two
</p>
<p>years I have mourned my mother, ever since that day
</p>
<p>when he so cruelly mocked me before my whole court
</p>
<p>by asking for her recall when he knew she was dead,

<p>ever since that day I have been trying in vain to get
</p>
<p>96 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>them to bury her in France with my fathers ? He has
</p>
<p>exiled even her ashes."
</p>
<p>At this moment Cinq-Mars thought he heard a sound
</p>
<p>on the staircase ; the king reddened.
</p>
<p>" Go," he said ; " go ! Make haste and prepare for
</p>
<p>the hunt ! Thou wilt ride next to my carriage. Go
</p>
<p>quickly ! I desire it ; go ! "
</p>
<p>And he himself pushed Cinq-Mars towards the en-
</p>
<p>trance by which he had come.
</p>
<p>The favorite went out ; but his master's anxiety had
</p>
<p>not escaped him.
</p>
<p>He slowly descended, and tried to divine the cause
</p>
<p>of it in his mind, when he thought he heard the sound
</p>
<p>of feet ascending the other staircase. He stopped ; they
</p>
<p>stopped. He re-ascended ; they seemed to him to descend.
</p>
<p>He knew that nothing could be seen between the inter-
</p>
<p>stices of the architecture ; and he quitted the place, im-
</p>
<p>patient and very uneasy, and determined to remain at
</p>
<p>the door of the entrance to see who should come out.
</p>
<p>But he had scarcely raised the tapestry which veiled the
</p>
<p>entrance to the guard-room than he was surrounded by
</p>
<p>a crowd of courtiers who had been awaiting him, and
</p>
<p>was fain to proceed to the work of issuing the orders
</p>
<p>connected with his post, or to receive respects, commu-
</p>
<p>nications, solicitations, presentations, recommendations,
</p>
<p>embraces, to observe that infinitude of relations which
</p>
<p>surround a favorite, and which require constant and sus-
</p>
<p>tained attention, for any absence of mind might cause
</p>
<p>great misfortunes. He thus almost forgot the trifling
</p>
<p>circumstance which had made him uneasy, and which

<p>he thought might after all have only been a freak of the
</p>
<p>THE HUNTING PARTY. 97
</p>
<p>imagination. Giving himself up to the sweets of a
</p>
<p>kind of continual apotheosis, he mounted his horse in
</p>
<p>the great courtyard, attended by noble pages, and sur-
</p>
<p>rounded by brilliant gentlemen.
</p>
<p>Monsieur soon arrived, followed by his people ; and in
</p>
<p>an hour the king appeared, pale, languishing, and sup-
</p>
<p>ported by four men. Cinq-Mars, dismounting, assisted
</p>
<p>him into a kind of small and very low carriage, called
</p>
<p>a brouette, and the horses of which, very docile and
</p>
<p>quiet ones, the king himself drove. The prickers on
</p>
<p>foot at the doors held the dogs in leash ; and at the
</p>
<p>sound of the horn scores of young nobles mounted, and
</p>
<p>all set out to the place of meeting.
</p>
<p>It was a farm called L'Ormage that the king had
</p>
<p>fixed upon ; and all the court, accustomed to his ways,
</p>
<p>diffused themselves through the roads of the park, while
</p>
<p>the king slowly followed an isolated path, having at his
</p>
<p>side the grand e'cuyer and four persons whom he had
</p>
<p>signed to approach him.
</p>
<p>The aspect of this pleasure party was sinister. The
</p>
<p>approach of winter had stripped well-nigh all the leaves
</p>
<p>from the great oaks in the park, whose dark branches
</p>
<p>now stood up against a gray sky, like branches of
</p>
<p>funereal candelabra. A light fog seemed to indicate
</p>
<p>rain ; through the melancholy boughs of the thinned
</p>
<p>wood the heavy carriages of the court were seen slowly
</p>
<p>passing on, filled with women uniformly dressed in
</p>
<p>black, and obliged to await the result of a chase
</p>
<p>which they did not witness. The distant hounds gave
</p>
<p>tongue, and the horn was sometimes faintly heard like a
</p>
<p>sigh. A cold, cutting wind obliged every man to cover ;

</p>
<p>and some of the women, putting over their faces a veil
</p>
<p>or mask of black velvet to keep themselves from the
</p>
<p>air which the curtains of their carriages did not in-
</p>
<p>tercept (for there were no glasses at that time), seemed
</p>
<p>to wear what is called a domino. All was languish-
</p>
<p>ing and sad. The only relief was that ever and anon,
</p>
<p>groups of young men in the excitement of the chase
</p>
<p>flew past the avenue like the wind, cheering on the dogs
</p>
<p>or sounding their horns; then all again became silent,
</p>
<p>as after the discharge of fire-works the sky appears
</p>
<p>darker than before.
</p>
<p>In a path, parallel with that followed by the king,
</p>
<p>were several courtiers enveloped in their cloaks. Ap-
</p>
<p>pearing little intent upon the stag, they rode even with
</p>
<p>the king's brouette, and never lost sight of him. They
</p>
<p>conversed in low tones.
</p>
<p>" Excellent ! Fontrailles, excellent ! victory ! The
</p>
<p>king takes his arm every moment. See how he smiles
</p>
<p>upon him ! See ! M. le Grand dismounts and gets into
</p>
<p>the brouette by his side. Come, come, the old fox is
</p>
<p>done at last ! "
</p>
<p>"Ah, that's nothing! Did not you see how the king
</p>
<p>shook hands with Monsieur ? He 's made a sign to you,
</p>
<p>Montre'sor. Look, Gondi ! "
</p>
<p>" Look, indeed ! That 's very easy to say ; but I don't
</p>
<p>see with my own eyes. I have only those of faith, and
</p>
<p>yours. Well, what are they doing now ? I wish to
</p>
<p>Heaven I were not so near-sighted ! Tell me, what are
</p>
<p>they doing ? "
</p>
<p>Montre'sor answered, " The king bends his ear towards

</p>
<p>again ! he gesticulates ! he does not cease ! Oh, he '11
</p>
<p>be minister!"
</p>
<p>" He will be minister ! '* said Fontrailles.
</p>
<p>"He will be minister!" echoed the Comte du Lude.
</p>
<p>" Oh, no doubt of it ! " said Montre'sor.
</p>
<p>" I hope he '11 give me a regiment, and I '11 marry my
</p>
<p>cousin," cried Olivier d'Entraigues, with boyish vivacity.
</p>
<p>The Abbd de Gondi sneered, and looking up at the
</p>
<p>sky, began to sing to a hunting tune,
</p>
<p>" Les etourneaux ont le vent bon,
</p>
<p>Ton ton, ton ton, ton taine, ton ton
</p>
<p>" I think, gentlemen, you are more short-sighted than
</p>
<p>I, or else miracles will come to pass in the year of grace
</p>
<p>1642 ; for M. de Bouillon is no nearer being prime min-
</p>
<p>ister, though the king do embrace him, than I. He has
</p>
<p>good qualities, but he will not do ; his qualities are not
</p>
<p>various enough. However, I have much respect for his
</p>
<p>great and singularly foolish town of Sedan, which is a
</p>
<p>fine shelter in case of need."
</p>
<p>Montre'sor and the rest were too attentive to every
</p>
<p>gesture of the prince to answer him ; and they con-
</p>
<p>tinued,
</p>
<p>" See, M. le Grand takes the reins, and is driving."
</p>
<p>The abbe* replied with the same air,
</p>
<p>" Si vous conduisez ma brouette,
</p>
<p>Nc versez pas, beau postilion,
</p>
<p>Ton ton, ton ton, ton taine, ton ton."

</p>
<p>100 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" I will also find you events which shall go to all the
</p>
<p>airs," answered Gondi.
</p>
<p>" Faith, the air of these pleases me ! " said Fontrailles,
</p>
<p>in an under voice. " I shall not be obliged by Monsieur
</p>
<p>to carry his confounded treaty to Madrid, and I am not
</p>
<p>sorry for it ; it is a somewhat touchy commission. The
</p>
<p>Pyrenees are not so easily passed as may be supposed ;
</p>
<p>the cardinal is on the road."
</p>
<p>" Ah, ah ! " cried Montresor.
</p>
<p>" Ah, ah ! " said Olivier.
</p>
<p>" Well, what is 't with you ? ah, ah ! " asked Gondi.
</p>
<p>"What have you discovered so fine?"
</p>
<p>" Why, the king has again shaken hands with Mon-
</p>
<p>sieur. Thank Heaven, gentlemen, we're rid of the
</p>
<p>cardinal ! The old boar is hunted down. Who will
</p>
<p>stick the knife into him ? He must be thrown into the
</p>
<p>sea."
</p>
<p>" That 's too good for him," said Olivier ; " he must
</p>
<p>be tried."
</p>
<p>" Certainly," said the abb ; " and we sha'n't want
</p>
<p>charges against an insolent fellow who has dared to
</p>
<p>discharge a page, shall we?" Then, curbing his horse,
</p>
<p>and letting Olivier and Montre"sor pass on, he leaned
</p>
<p>towards M. du Lude, who was talking to two other
</p>
<p>serious personages, and said,
</p>
<p>" In truth, I am tempted to let my valet-de-chambre
</p>
<p>into the secret ; never was a conspiracy treated so
</p>
<p>lightly. Great enterprises require mystery. This would
</p>
<p>be an admirable one if some trouble were taken with it.

<p>history. There is stuff enough in it to upset three
</p>
<p>THE HUNTING PARTY. 101
</p>
<p>kingdoms, if necessary, and the blockheads will spoil
</p>
<p>all. It is really a pity. I should be very sorry. I 've a
</p>
<p>taste for affairs of this kind ; and in this one in par-
</p>
<p>ticular I feel a special interest. There is grandeur
</p>
<p>about it, as cannot be denied. Do you not think so,
</p>
<p>D'Aubijoux, Montmort?"
</p>
<p>White he was speaking, several large and heavy car-
</p>
<p>riages, with six and four horses, followed the same path
</p>
<p>at two hundred paces behind these gentlemen ; the cur-
</p>
<p>tains were open on the left side through which to see the
</p>
<p>king. In the first was the queen ; she was alone at the
</p>
<p>back, clothed in black and veiled. On the front was
</p>
<p>the Mare'chale d'Effiat ; and at the feet of the queen was
</p>
<p>the Princesse Marie. Seated on one side on a stool, her
</p>
<p>robe and her feet hung out of the carriage, and were
</p>
<p>supported by a gilt step, for, as we have already ob-
</p>
<p>served, there were then no doors to the coaches. She
</p>
<p>also tried to see through the trees the movements of
</p>
<p>the king, and often leaned back, annoyed by the pass-
</p>
<p>ing of the prince palatine and his suite.
</p>
<p>This northern prince was sent by the King of Poland,
</p>
<p>apparently on a political negotiation, but in reality, to
</p>
<p>induce the Duchesse de Mantua to espouse the old King
</p>
<p>Uladislas VI. ; and he displayed at the court of France
</p>
<p>all the luxury of his own, then called at Paris " barba-
</p>
<p>rian and Scythian," and so far justified these names by
</p>
<p>strange eastern costumes. The palatine of Posnania was
</p>
<p>very handsome, and wore, in common with the people of
</p>
<p>his suite, a long thick beard. His head, shaved like that
</p>
<p>of a Turk, was covered with a furred cap. He had a

</p>
<p>short vest, enriched with diamonds and rubies ; his horse
</p>
<p>102 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>was painted red, and amply plumed. He was attended
</p>
<p>by a company of Polish guards in red and yellow uni-
</p>
<p>forms, wearing large cloaks with long sleeves, which
</p>
<p>hung negligently from the shoulder. The Polish lords
</p>
<p>who escorted him were dressed in gold and silver bro-
</p>
<p>cade ; and behind their shaved heads floated a single
</p>
<p>lock of hair, which gave them an Asiatic and Tartar
</p>
<p>aspect, as unknown at the court of Louis XIII. as
</p>
<p>that of the Moscovites. The women thought all this
</p>
<p>rather savage and alarming.
</p>
<p>Marie de Gonzaga was importuned with the profound
</p>
<p>salutations and Oriental elegancies of this foreigner and
</p>
<p>his suite. Whenever he passed before her, he thought
</p>
<p>himself called upon to address a compliment to her in
</p>
<p>broken French, awkwardly made up of a few words
</p>
<p>about hope and royalty. She found no other means
</p>
<p>to rid herself of him than by repeatedly putting her
</p>
<p>handkerchief to her nose, and saying aloud to the
</p>
<p>queen,
</p>
<p>"In truth, Madame, these gentlemen have an odor
</p>
<p>about them that makes one quite ill."
</p>
<p>" It will be desirable to strengthen your nerves and
</p>
<p>accustom yourself to it," answered Anne of Austria,
</p>
<p>somewhat dryly.
</p>
<p>Then, fearing she had hurt her feelings, she con-
</p>
<p>tinued gayly,
</p>
<p>" You will become used to them, as we have done ;
</p>
<p>and you know that in respect to odors I am rather
</p>
<p>fastidious. M. Mazarin told me, the other day, that my
</p>
<p>punishment in purgatory will consist in breathing ill

<p>scents, and sleeping in Russian cloth."
</p>
<p>THE HUNTING PARTY. 103
</p>
<p>Yet the queen was very grave, and soon subsided into
</p>
<p>silence. Burying herself in her carriage, enveloped in
</p>
<p>her mantle, and apparently taking no interest in what
</p>
<p>was passing around her, she yielded to the motion of
</p>
<p>the carriage. Marie, still occupied with the king,
</p>
<p>talked in a low voice with the Marechale d'Effiat ; each
</p>
<p>sought to give the other hopes which neither felt, and
</p>
<p>sought to deceive each other out of love.
</p>
<p>" Madame, I congratulate you ; M. le Grand is seated
</p>
<p>with the king. Never has he been so highly distin-
</p>
<p>guished," said Marie.
</p>
<p>Then she was silent for a long time, and the carriage
</p>
<p>rolled mournfully over the dead, dry leaves.
</p>
<p>" Yes, I see it with joy : the king is so good ! "
</p>
<p>answered the marechale.
</p>
<p>And she sighed deeply.
</p>
<p>A long and sad silence again followed; each looked
</p>
<p>at the other and mutually found their eyes full of tears.
</p>
<p>They dared not speak again ; and Marie, drooping her
</p>
<p>head, saw nothing but the brown, damp earth scattered
</p>
<p>by the wheels. A melancholy revery occupied her
</p>
<p>mind ; and although she had before her the spectacle
</p>
<p>of the first court of Europe at the feet of him she loved,
</p>
<p>everything inspired her with fear, and dark presenti-
</p>
<p>ments involuntarily agitated her.
</p>
<p>Suddenly a horse passed by her like the wind , she
</p>
<p>raised her eyes, and had just time to see the features of
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars. He did not look at her; he was pale as a
</p>
<p>corpse, and his eyes were hidden under his knitted
</p>
<p>brows and the shadow of his lowered hat. She followed

</p>
<p>him with trembling eyes ; she saw him stop in the midst
</p>
<p>104 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>of the group of cavaliers who preceded the carriages,
</p>
<p>and who received him with their hats off. A moment
</p>
<p>after he went into the wood with one of them, looking
</p>
<p>at her from the distance, and following her with his
</p>
<p>eyes until the carriage had passed ; then he seemed to
</p>
<p>give the man a roll of papers, and disappeared. The
</p>
<p>mist which was falling prevented her from seeing him
</p>
<p>any more. It was, indeed, one of those fogs so frequent
</p>
<p>on the banks of the Loire. The sun looked at first like
</p>
<p>a small blood-red moon, enveloped in a tattered shroud,
</p>
<p>and within half an hour was concealed under so thick
</p>
<p>a cloud that Marie could scarcely distinguish the fore-
</p>
<p>most horses of the carriage, while the men who passed
</p>
<p>at the distance of a few paces looked like grizzly
</p>
<p>shadows. This icy vapor turned to a penetrating rain
</p>
<p>and at the same time a cloud oi fetid odor. The queen
</p>
<p>made the beautiful princess sit beside her; and they
</p>
<p>turned towards Chambord quickly and in silence.
</p>
<p>They soon heard the horns recalling the scattered
</p>
<p>hounds ; the huntsmen passed rapidly by the carriage,
</p>
<p>seeking their way through the fog, and calling to each
</p>
<p>other. Marie saw only now and then the head of a
</p>
<p>horse, or a dark body half issuing from the gloomy
</p>
<p>vapor of the woods, and tried in vain to distinguish any
</p>
<p>words. At length her heart beat ; there was a call for
</p>
<p>M. de Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>" The king asks for M. le Grand," was repeated
</p>
<p>about ; " where can M. le Grand cuyer be gone to ? "
</p>
<p>A voice, passing near, said, " He has just lost
</p>
<p>himself."

</p>
<p>These simple words made her shudder, for her
</p>
<p>THE HUNTING PARTY. 105
</p>
<p>afflicted spirit gave them the most sinister meaning.
</p>
<p>The terrible thought pursued her to the chateau and
</p>
<p>into her apartments, wherein she hastened to shut her-
</p>
<p>self. She soon heard the noise of the entry of the king
</p>
<p>and of Monsieur, then, in the forest, some shots whose
</p>
<p>flash was unseen. She in vain looked at the narrow
</p>
<p>windows; they seemed covered on the outside with a
</p>
<p>white cloth that shut out the light.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the extremity of the forest, towards
</p>
<p>Montfrault, there had lost themselves two cavaliers,
</p>
<p>wearied with seeking the way to the chateau in the
</p>
<p>monotonous similarity of the trees and paths; they
</p>
<p>were about to stop near a pond, when eight or nine
</p>
<p>men, springing from the thickets, rushed upon them,
</p>
<p>and before they had time to draw, hung to their legs
</p>
<p>and arms and to the bridles of their horses in such a
</p>
<p>manner as to hold them fixed. At the same time a
</p>
<p>hoarse voice cried in the fog,
</p>
<p>" Are you Royalists or Cardinalists ? Cry, ' Vive le
</p>
<p>Grand ! ' or you are dead men ! "
</p>
<p>" Scoundrels," answered the first cavalier, trying to
</p>
<p>open the holsters of his pistols, " I will have you
</p>
<p>hanged for abusing my name."
</p>
<p>" Dios es le Senor ! " cried the same voice.
</p>
<p>All the men immediately released their hold, and
</p>
<p>ran into the wood ; a burst of savage laughter was
</p>
<p>heard, and a man approached Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>" Amigo, do you not recognize me ? 'T is but a joke
</p>
<p>of Jacques, the Spanish captain."
</p>

<p>the grand e*cuyer,
</p>
<p>106 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" Sir, this is an enterprising fellow ; I would advise
</p>
<p>you to employ him. We must neglect no chance."
</p>
<p>" Listen to me," said Jacques de Laubardemont, " and
</p>
<p>answer at once. I am not a phrase-maker, like my
</p>
<p>father. I bear in mind that you have done me some
</p>
<p>good offices ; and lately again, you have been useful to
</p>
<p>me, as you always are, without knowing it, for I have
</p>
<p>somewhat repaired my fortune in your little insurrec-
</p>
<p>tions. If you will, I can render you an important
</p>
<p>service ; I command a few brave men."
</p>
<p>" What service ? " asked Cinq-Mars. " We will
</p>
<p>see."
</p>
<p>" I commence by a piece of information. This morn-
</p>
<p>ing while you descended the king's staircase on one
</p>
<p>side, Father Joseph ascended the other."
</p>
<p>" Ha ! this, then, is the secret of his sudden and in-
</p>
<p>explicable change ! Can it be ? A king of France ! and
</p>
<p>to allow us to confide all our secrets to him."
</p>
<p>" Well ! is that all ? Do you say nothing ? You know
</p>
<p>I have an old account to settle with the Capuchin."
</p>
<p>" What 's that to me ? " and he hung down his head,
</p>
<p>absorbed in a profound revery.
</p>
<p>" It matters a great deal to you, since you have only
</p>
<p>to speak the word, and I will rid you of him before
</p>
<p>thirty-six hours from this time, though he is now very
</p>
<p>near Paris. We might even add the cardinal, if you
</p>
<p>wish."
</p>
<p>" Leave me ; I will use no poniards," said Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>" Ah ! I understand you," replied Jacques. " You are
</p>
<p>right ; you would prefer our despatching him with the

</p>
<p>due to him. It were undoubtedly more suitable for
</p>
<p>great lords to take charge of the cardinal ; and that he
</p>
<p>who despatches his Eminence should be in a fair way
</p>
<p>to be a marechal. For myself, I am not proud ; one
</p>
<p>must not be proud, whatever one's merit in one's pro-
</p>
<p>fession. I must not touch the cardinal ; he 's a morsel
</p>
<p>for a king ! "
</p>
<p>" Nor any others," said the grand e*cuyer.
</p>
<p>" Oh, let us have the Capuchin ! " said Captain
</p>
<p>Jacques, urgently.
</p>
<p>" You* are wrong if you refuse this office," said Fon-
</p>
<p>trailles ; " such things occur every day. Vitry began
</p>
<p>with Concini ; and he was made a mare'chal. You see
</p>
<p>men extremely well at court, who have killed their
</p>
<p>enemies with their own hand in the streets of Paris,
</p>
<p>and you hesitate to rid yourself of a villain ! Richelieu
</p>
<p>has his agents ; you must have yours. I cannot under-
</p>
<p>stand your scruples."
</p>
<p>" Do not torment him," said Jacques, abruptly ; " I
</p>
<p>understand it. I thought as he does when I was a boy,
</p>
<p>before reason came. I would not have killed even a
</p>
<p>monk ; but let me speak to him." Then turning to-
</p>
<p>wards Cinq-Mars, " Listen : when men conspire, they
</p>
<p>seek the death or at least the downfall of some one,
</p>
<p>eh?"
</p>
<p>And he paused.
</p>
<p>" Now in that case, we are out with God, and in with
</p>
<p>the Devil, eh ? "
</p>
<p>" Secundo, as they say at the Sorbonne ; it 's no
</p>
<p>worse when one is damned, to be so for much than for

<p>little, eh ? "
</p>
<p>108 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>"Ergo, it is indifferent whether a thousand or one be
</p>
<p>killed. I defy you to answer that."
</p>
<p>" Nothing could be better argued, Doctor-dagger," said
</p>
<p>Fontrailles, half-laughing, " I see you will be a good trav-
</p>
<p>elling-companion. You shall go with me to Spain if you
</p>
<p>like."
</p>
<p>" I know you are going to take the treaty there," an-
</p>
<p>swered Jacques ; " and I will guide you through the Pyre-
</p>
<p>nees by roads unknown to man. But I shall be horribly
</p>
<p>vexed to go away without having wrung the neck of that
</p>
<p>old he-goat, whom we leave behind, like a knight in the
</p>
<p>midst of a game of chess. Once more, sir," he con-
</p>
<p>tinued with an air of pious earnestness, " if you have
</p>
<p>any religion in you, refuse no longer ; recollect the
</p>
<p>words of our theological fathers, Hurtado de Mendoza
</p>
<p>and Sanchez, who have proved that a man may secretly
</p>
<p>kill his enemies, since by this means he avoids two sins,
</p>
<p>that of exposing his life, and that of fighting a duel.
</p>
<p>It is in accordance with this grand consolatory principle
</p>
<p>that I have always acted."
</p>
<p>" Go, go ! " said Cinq-Mars, in a voice thick with rage ;
</p>
<p>" I have other things to think of."
</p>
<p>"Of what more important ?" said Fontrailles ; "this
</p>
<p>might be a great weight in the balance of our destinies."
</p>
<p>" I am thinking how much the heart of a king weighs
</p>
<p>in it," said Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>" You terrify me," replied the gentleman ; " we can-
</p>
<p>not go so far as that ! "
</p>
<p>" Nor do I think what you suppose, sir," continued
</p>
<p>D'Effiat, in a severe tone. " I was merely reflecting how

</p>
<p>war ! war ! civil war, foreign war, let your fires be kin-
</p>
<p>dled ! since I hold the match, I will apply it to the mine.
</p>
<p>Perish the State ! perish twenty kingdoms, if necessary !
</p>
<p>No ordinary calamities suffice when the king betrays
</p>
<p>the subject. Listen to me."
</p>
<p>And he took Fontrailles a few steps aside.
</p>
<p>" I only charged you to prepare our retreat and suc-
</p>
<p>cors, in case of abandonment on the part of the king.
</p>
<p>Just now I foresaw this abandonment in his forced mani-
</p>
<p>festation of friendship ; and I decided upon your setting-
</p>
<p>out when he finished his conversation by announcing
</p>
<p>his departure for Perpignan. I feared Narbonne ; I now
</p>
<p>see that he is going there to deliver himself up a prisoner
</p>
<p>to the cardinal. Go at once. I add to the letters I have
</p>
<p>given you the treaty here ; it is in fictitious names, but
</p>
<p>here is the counterpart, signed by Monsieur, by the Due
</p>
<p>de Bouillon, and by me. The Count-Duke of Olivares
</p>
<p>desires nothing further. There are blanks for the Due
</p>
<p>d'Orldans, which you will fill up as you please. Go ; in
</p>
<p>a month I shall expect you at Perpignan. I will have
</p>
<p>Sedan opened to the seventeen thousand Spaniards from
</p>
<p>Flanders."
</p>
<p>Then advancing towards the adventurer, who awaited
</p>
<p>him, he said,
</p>
<p>" For you, brave fellow, since you desire to aid me, I
</p>
<p>charge you with escorting this gentleman to Madrid;
</p>
<p>you will be largely recompensed."
</p>
<p>Jacques, twisting his mustache, replied,

</p>
<p>hibit your judgment and taste. Do you know that the

</p>
<p>wished to have me with her as her confidential man ?
</p>
<p>She was brought up to the sound of the cannon by the
</p>
<p>' Lion of the North,' Gustavus Adolphus, her father. She
</p>
<p>loves the smell of powder and brave men ; but I would
</p>
<p>not serve her, because she is a Huguenot, and I have
</p>
<p>fixed principles, from which I never swerve. Par ex-
</p>
<p>emple, I swear to you by Saint Jacques to guide Monsieur

<p>and disappeared in the wood, on his return to the chateau

<p>P. DE LAMENNAIS.
</p>
<p>SHORTLY after the events just narrated, at the corner of
</p>
<p>the Palais-Royal, at a small and pretty house, numerous
</p>
<p>carriages were seen to draw up, and a door, reached by
</p>
<p>three stone steps, frequently to open. The neighbors
</p>
<p>often came to their windows to complain of the noise
</p>
<p>made at so late an hour of the night, despite the fear of
</p>
<p>robbers ; and the patrol often stopped in surprise, and
</p>
<p>only passed on when they saw at each carriage ten or
</p>
<p>twelve footmen, armed with staves and carrying torches.
</p>
<p>A young gentleman, followed by three lackeys, entered
</p>
<p>and asked for Mademoiselle de Lorme. He wore a long

</p>
<p>of the same color on his high-heeled shoes almost en-
</p>
<p>tirely concealed his feet, which after the fashion of the
</p>
<p>day he turned very much out. He frequently twisted a
</p>
<p>small curling mustache, and before entering combed his
</p>
<p>small pointed beard. There was but one exclamation
</p>
<p>when he was announced.
</p>
<p>" Here he is at last ! " cried a young and rich voice.
</p>
<p>" He has made us wait long enough for him, the dear
</p>
<p>Desbarreaux. Come, take a seat ! place yourself at this
</p>
<p>table and read."
</p>
<p>The speaker was a woman of about four-and-twenty,
</p>
<p>tall and handsome, notwithstanding her somewhat
</p>
<p>woolly black hair and her dark olive complexion.
</p>
<p>There was something masculine in her manner, which
</p>
<p>she seemed to derive from her circle, composed entirely
</p>
<p>of men. She took their arm unceremoniously, as she
</p>
<p>spoke to them, with a freedom which she communicated
</p>
<p>to them. Her conversation was animated rather than
</p>
<p>joyous. It often excited laughter around her ; but it
</p>
<p>was by dint of intellect that she created gayety (if we
</p>
<p>may so express it), for her countenance, impassioned
</p>
<p>as it was, seemed incapable of bending into a smile, and
</p>
<p>her large blue eyes, under her jet-black hair, gave her
</p>
<p>at first rather a strange appearance.
</p>
<p>Desbarreaux kissed her hand with a gallant and
</p>
<p>chivalrous air. He then, talking to her all the time,
</p>
<p>walked round the large room, where were assembled
</p>
<p>nearly thirty persons, some seated in the large arm-
</p>
<p>chairs, others standing in the vast chimney-place, others
</p>
<p>conversing in the embrasures of the windows under the

<p>illustrious ; others illustrious men, now obscure for us

<p>posterity. Thus, among the latter, he profoundly sa-
</p>
<p>luted MM. d'Aubijoux, de Brion, de Montmort, and
</p>
<p>other very brilliant gentlemen, who were there as
</p>
<p>judges ; tenderly, and with an air of esteem, pressed the
</p>
<p>hands of MM. Monteruel, de Sirmond, de Malleville,
</p>
<p>Baro, Gombauld, and other learned men, almost all
</p>
<p>called great men in the annals of the academy of which
</p>
<p>they were the founders, itself called sometimes the
</p>
<p>Acade*mie des Beaux Esprits, sometimes the Academic
</p>
<p>^minente. But M. Desbarreaux gave but a mere patron-
</p>
<p>izing nod to young Corneille, who was talking in a cor-
</p>
<p>ner with a foreigner, and with a young man whom he
</p>
<p>presented to the mistress of the house by the name of
</p>
<p>M. Poquelin, son of the valet^de-cliambre tapissier du roi.
</p>
<p>The foreigner was Milton ; the young man was Molire.
</p>
<p>Before the reading expected from the young Sybarite,
</p>
<p>a great contest arose between him and other poets and
</p>
<p>prose writers of the time. They spoke to each other
</p>
<p>with great volubility and animation a language incom-
</p>
<p>prehensible to any one who should suddenly have come
</p>
<p>among them without being initiated, eagerly pressing
</p>
<p>each other's hands with affectionate compliments and
</p>
<p>infinite allusions to their works.
</p>
<p>" Ah, here you are, illustrious Baro ! " cried the new-
</p>
<p>comer. " I have read your last sixain. Ah, what a
</p>
<p>sixain! how full of the gallant and the tendre!"
</p>
<p>" What is that you say of the Tendre ? " interrupted
</p>
<p>Marion de Lorme ; " have you ever seen that country ?
</p>
<p>You stopped at the village of Grand-Esprit, and at that
</p>
<p>of Jolis-Vers, but you have been no farther. If M. le

</p>
<p>Gouverneur de Notre Dame de la Garde will please to
</p>
<p>show us his new chart, I will tell you where you are."
</p>
<p>Scudery arose with a vain-glorious and pedantic air ;
</p>
<p>and unrolling upon the table a sort of geographical chart,
</p>
<p>tied with blue ribbons, he himself showed the lines of
</p>
<p>red ink which he had traced upon it.
</p>
<p>" This is the finest piece of ' Clelie,' " he said. " This
</p>
<p>chart is generally found very gallant ; but 't is merely a
</p>
<p>slight ebullition of playful wit, to please our little literary
</p>
<p>cabale. However, as there are strange people in the
</p>
<p>world, it is possible that all who see it may not have
</p>
<p>minds sufficiently well turned to understand it. This is
</p>
<p>the road which must be followed to go from Nouvelle-
</p>
<p>Amiti^ to Tendre ; and observe, gentlemen, that as we
</p>
<p>say Cumae-on-the-Ionian-Sea, Cumae-on-the-Tyrrhean-Sea,
</p>
<p>we shall say Tendre-sur-Inclination, Tendre-sur-Estime,
</p>
<p>and Tendre-sur-Reconnaissance. We must begin by
</p>
<p>inhabiting the village of Grand-Cosur, Ge'ne'rosite', Ex-
</p>
<p>actitude, and Petits-Soins."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! how very pretty ! " interposed Desbarreaux.
</p>
<p>" See the villages marked out ; here is Petits-Soins,
</p>
<p>Billet-Galant, then Billet-Doux ! "
</p>
<p>"Oh! 'tis ingenious in the highest degree !" cried
</p>
<p>Vaugelas, Colletet, and the rest.
</p>
<p>" And observe," continued the author, inflated with
</p>
<p>this success, " that it is necessary to pass through Com-
</p>
<p>plaisance and Sensibility ; and that if we do not take
</p>
<p>this road, we run the risk of losing our way to Tiedeur,
</p>
<p>Oubli, and of falling into the lake of Indifference."

</p>
<p>" Well, Madame," resumed Scude*ry, " I now declare
</p>
<p>it in your house : this work, printed under my name, is
</p>
<p>by my sister, she who translated ' Sappho ' so agree-
</p>
<p>ably." And without being asked, he recited in a de-
</p>
<p>clamatory tone verses ending thus :
</p>
<p>" L'amour est un mal agreable 1
</p>
<p>Dont mon coeur ne saurait guerir ;
</p>
<p>Mais quand il serait guerissable,
</p>
<p>II est bien plus doux d'en mourir."
</p>
<p>" How ! had that Greek so much wit ? I cannot be-
</p>
<p>lieve it," exclaimed Marion de Lorme ; " how superior
</p>
<p>Mademoiselle de Scude'ry is to her ! That idea is wholly
</p>
<p>hers ; she must unquestionably put these charming
</p>
<p>verses into ' Cl^lie.' They will figure well in that Roman
</p>
<p>history."
</p>
<p>" Admirable, perfect ! " cried all the savans ; " Hora-'
</p>
<p>tius, Aruns, and the amiable Porsenna are such gallant
</p>
<p>lovers."
</p>
<p>They were all bending over the " carte de Tendre,"
</p>
<p>and their fingers crossed in following the windings of
</p>
<p>the amorous rivers. The young Poquelin ventured to
</p>
<p>raise a timid voice and his melancholy but acute glance,
</p>
<p>and said,
</p>
<p>" What purpose does this serve ? Is it to give happi-
</p>
<p>ness or pleasure ? Monsieur seems to me not singularly
</p>
<p>happy, and I do not feel very gay."
</p>
<p>The only reply he got was a general look of contempt ;
</p>
<p>he consoled himself by meditating, " Les Pre*cieuses
</p>
<p>Ridicules."

</p>
<p>he was penitent for having composed in an illness ; he
</p>
<p>seemed to be ashamed of having thought for a moment
</p>
<p>upon God at the sight of his lightning, and blushed at
</p>
<p>the weakness. The mistress of the house stopped him.
</p>
<p>" It is not yet time to read your beautiful verses ; you
</p>
<p>would be interrupted. We expect M. le Grand Ecuyer
</p>
<p>and other gentlemen ; it would be actual murder to allow
</p>
<p>a great mind to speak during this noise and confusion.
</p>
<p>But here is a young Englishman who has just come from
</p>
<p>Italy, and is on his return to London. They tell me he
</p>
<p>has composed a poem I don't know what ; but he '11
</p>
<p>repeat some verses of it. Many of you gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>eminent company know English ; and for the rest he has
</p>
<p>had the passages he is going to read translated by an ex-
</p>
<p>secretary of the Duke of Buckingham, and here are copies
</p>
<p>in French on this table."
</p>
<p>So saying, she took them and distributed them among
</p>
<p>her erudite visitors. The company seated themselves,
</p>
<p>and were silent. It took some time to persuade the
</p>
<p>young foreigner to speak or to quit the recess of the
</p>
<p>window, where he seemed to have come to a very good
</p>
<p>understanding with Corneille. He at last advanced to
</p>
<p>an armchair placed near the table ; he seemed of feeble
</p>
<p>health, and fell into, rather than seated himself, in the
</p>
<p>chair. He rested his elbow on the table, and with his
</p>
<p>hand covered his large and beautiful eyes, which were
</p>
<p>half closed, and reddened with night-watches or tears.
</p>
<p>He repeated his fragments from memory. His doubting
</p>
<p>auditors looked at him haughtily, or at least patroniz-
</p>

<p>his verses.

<p>THE READING. 117
</p>
<p>His voice, at first suppressed, grew clearer by the very
</p>
<p>flow of his harmonious recital ; the breath of poetic in-
</p>
<p>spiration soon elevated him to himself; and his look,
</p>
<p>raised to heaven, became sublime as that of the young
</p>
<p>evangelist, conceived by Raffaello, for the light still
</p>
<p>shone on it. He narrated in his verses the first disobe-
</p>
<p>dience of man, and invoked the Holy Spirit, who prefers
</p>
<p>before all other temples a pure and simple heart, who
</p>
<p>knows all, and who was present at the birth of time.
</p>
<p>This opening was received with a profound silence ;
</p>
<p>and a slight murmur arose after the enunciation of
</p>
<p>the last idea. He heard not ; he saw only through a
</p>
<p>cloud ; he was in the world of his own creation. He
</p>
<p>continued.
</p>
<p>He spoke of the infernal spirit, bound in avenging fire
</p>
<p>by adamantine chains, lying vanquished nine times the
</p>
<p>space that measures night and day to mortal men; of
</p>
<p>the darkness visible of the eternal prisons and the burn-
</p>
<p>ing ocean where the fallen angels float. Then, his voice,
</p>
<p>now powerful, began the address of the fallen angel.
</p>
<p>" Art thou," he said, " he who in the happy realms of
</p>
<p>light, clothed with transcendent brightness, didst out-
</p>
<p>shine myriads ? From what height fallen ? What though
</p>
<p>the field be lost, all is not lost ! Unconquerable will and
</p>
<p>study of revenge, immortal hate and courage never to
</p>
<p>submit nor yield what is else not to be overcome."
</p>
<p>Here a lackey in a loud voice announced MM. de
</p>
<p>Montrdsor and d'Entraigues. They saluted, exchanged
</p>
<p>a few words, deranged the chairs, and then settled down.
</p>
<p>The auditors availed themselves of the interruption to

</p>
<p>thing was heard but expressions of censure, and imputa-
</p>
<p>tions of bad taste. Even some men of merit, dulled by
</p>
<p>a particular habit of thinking, cried out that they did
</p>
<p>not understand it ; that it was above their comprehen-
</p>
<p>sion (not thinking how truly they spoke) ; and from
</p>
<p>this feigned humility gained themselves a compliment,
</p>
<p>and for the poet an impertinent remark, a double
</p>
<p>advantage. Some voices even pronounced the word
</p>
<p>" profanation."
</p>
<p>The poet, interrupted, put his head between his hands
</p>
<p>and his elbows on the table, that he might not hear the
</p>
<p>noise either of praise or censure. Three men only ap-
</p>
<p>proached him, an officer, Poquelin, and Corneille ; the
</p>
<p>latter whispered to Milton,
</p>
<p>" I would advise you to change the picture ; your
</p>
<p>hearers are not on a level with this."
</p>
<p>The officer pressed the hand of the English poet and
</p>
<p>said to him,
</p>
<p>" I admire you with all my soul."
</p>
<p>The astonished Englishman looked at him, and saw an
</p>
<p>intellectual, impassioned, and sickly countenance.
</p>
<p>He bowed, and collected himself, in order to proceed.
</p>
<p>His voice took a gentle tone and a soft accent ; he spoke
</p>
<p>of the chaste happiness of the two first of human beings.
</p>
<p>He described their majestic nakedness, the ingenuous
</p>
<p>command of their looks, their walk among lions and
</p>
<p>tigers, which gambolled at their feet ; he spoke of the
</p>
<p>purity of their morning prayer, of their enchanting
</p>
<p>smile, the playful tenderness of their youth, and their
</p>
<p>enamoured conversation, so painful to the Prince of

<p>Darkness.
</p>
<p>THE READING. 119
</p>
<p>Gentle tears quite involuntarily made humid the eyes
</p>
<p>of the beautiful Marion de Lorme. Nature had taken
</p>
<p>possession of her heart, despite her head ; poetry filled it
</p>
<p>with grave and religious thoughts, from which the in-
</p>
<p>toxication of pleasure had ever diverted her. The idea
</p>
<p>of virtuous love appeared to her for the first time in all
</p>
<p>its beauty ; and she seemed as if struck with a magic
</p>
<p>wand, and changed into a pale and beautiful statue.
</p>
<p>Corneille, his young friend, and the officer, were full
</p>
<p>of a silent admiration which they dared not express,
</p>
<p>for raised voices drowned that of the surprised poet.
</p>
<p>" I can't stand this ! " cried Desbarreaux. " It 's of
</p>
<p>an insipidity to make one sick."
</p>
<p>" And what absence of grace, gallantry, and the belle
</p>
<p>flamme ! " said Scudery, coldly.
</p>
<p>" Ah, how different from our immortal D'Urfe ! " said
</p>
<p>Baro, the continuator.
</p>
<p>" Where is the ' Ariane,' where the ' Astrea ? ' " cried,
</p>
<p>with a groan, Godeau, the annotator.
</p>
<p>The whole assembly well-nigh voiced these obliging re-
</p>
<p>marks, though uttered so as only to be heard by the poet
</p>
<p>as a murmur of uncertain import. He understood how-
</p>
<p>ever that he produced no enthusiasm, and collected
</p>
<p>himself to touch another chord of his lyre.
</p>
<p>At this moment the Counsellor de Thou was an-
</p>
<p>nounced, who, modestly saluting the company, glided
</p>
<p>silently behind the author near Corneille, Poquelin, and
</p>
<p>the young officer. Milton resumed his strain.
</p>
<p>He recounted the arrival of a celestial guest in the
</p>
<p>garden of Eden, like a second Aurora in midday, shak-

<p>ing the plumes of his divine wings, that filled the air

</p>
<p>with heavenly fragrance, who recounted to man the his-
</p>
<p>tory of heaven, the revolt of Lucifer, clothed in an ar-
</p>
<p>mor of diamonds, raised on a car brilliant as the sun,
</p>
<p>guarded by glittering cherubim, and marching against
</p>
<p>the Eternal. But Emmanuel appears on the living char-
</p>
<p>iot of the Lord ; and his two thousand thunderbolts
</p>
<p>hurled down to hell, with awful noise, the accursed army
</p>
<p>confounded.
</p>
<p>At this the company arose ; and all was interrupted,
</p>
<p>for religious scruples became leagued with false taste.
</p>
<p>Nothing was heard but exclamations which obliged the
</p>
<p>mistress of the house to rise also, and endeavor to con-
</p>
<p>ceal them from the author. This was not difficult, for
</p>
<p>he was entirely absorbed in the elevation of his thoughts.
</p>
<p>His genius at this moment had nothing in common with
</p>
<p>the earth ; and when he once more opened his eyes on
</p>
<p>those who surrounded him, he saw near him four admir-
</p>
<p>ers, whose voices were better heard than those of the
</p>
<p>assembly.
</p>
<p>Corneille said to him,
</p>
<p>" Listen. If you aim at present glory, do not expect
</p>
<p>it from so fine a work. Pure poetry is appreciated by
</p>
<p>but few souls. For the common run of men, it must be
</p>
<p>closely allied with the almost physical interest of the
</p>
<p>drama. I had been tempted to make a poem of ' Poly-
</p>
<p>euctes ; ' but I shall cut down this subject, abridge it of
</p>
<p>the heavens, and it shall be only a tragedy."
</p>
<p>" What matters to me the glory of the moment ? " an-
</p>
<p>swered Milton. " I think not of success. I sing be-
</p>
<p>cause I feel myself a poet. I go whither inspiration

<p>THE READING. 121
</p>
<p>verses were not to be read till a century after my death,
</p>
<p>I should write them just the same."
</p>
<p>"I admire them before they are written," said the
</p>
<p>young officer. " I see in them the God whose innate
</p>
<p>image I have found in my heart."
</p>
<p>" Who is it speaks thus kindly to me ? " asked the
</p>
<p>poet.
</p>
<p>" 1 am Rene* Descartes," replied the soldier, gently.
</p>
<p>" How, sir ! " cried De Thou. " Are you so happy as
</p>
<p>to be related to the author of the ' Princeps ' ? "
</p>
<p>" I am the author of that work," replied Rene'.
</p>
<p>" You, sir ! but still pardon me but are
</p>
<p>you not a military man ? " stammered out the counsellor,
</p>
<p>in amazement.
</p>
<p>" Well, what has the habit of the body to do with the
</p>
<p>thought ? Yes, I wear the sword. I was at the siege
</p>
<p>of Rochelle. I love the profession of arms because it
</p>
<p>keeps the soul in a region of noble ideas by the contin-
</p>
<p>ual feeling of the sacrifice of life ; yet it does not occupy
</p>
<p>the whole man. He cannot always apply his thoughts
</p>
<p>to it. Peace lulls them. Moreover, one has also to fear
</p>
<p>seeing them suddenly interrupted by an obscure blow
</p>
<p>or an absurd and untimely accident. And if a man be
</p>
<p>killed in the execution of his plan, posterity preserves
</p>
<p>an idea of the plan which he himself had not, and which
</p>
<p>may be wholly preposterous ; and this is the evil side of
</p>
<p>the profession for a man of letters."
</p>
<p>De Thou smiled with pleasure at the simple language
</p>
<p>of this superior man, this man whom he so admired,
</p>
<p>and in his admiration loved. He pressed the hand of

<p>the young sage of Touraine, and drew him into an ad-

</p>
<p>joining cabinet with Corneille, Milton, and Molidre, and
</p>
<p>with them enjoyed one of those conversations which
</p>
<p>make us regard as lost the time which precedes them
</p>
<p>and the time which is to follow them.
</p>
<p>For two hours they had enchanted one another with
</p>
<p>their discourse, when the sound of music, of guitars and
</p>
<p>flutes playing minuets, sarabands, allemandes, and the
</p>
<p>Spanish dances which the young queen had brought into
</p>
<p>fashion, the continual passing of groups of young ladies
</p>
<p>and their joyous laughter, all announced that the ball
</p>
<p>had commenced. A very young and beautiful person,
</p>
<p>holding a large fan as it were a sceptre, and surrounded
</p>
<p>by ten young men, entered their retired chamber with
</p>
<p>her brilliant court, which she ruled like a queen, and
</p>
<p>entirely put to the rout the studious conversers.
</p>
<p>" Adieu, gentlemen ! " said De Thou. " I make way
</p>
<p>for Mademoiselle de Lenclos and her musketeers."
</p>
<p>" Really, gentlemen," said the youthful Ninon, " we
</p>
<p>seem to frighten you. Have I disturbed you ? You
</p>
<p>have all the air of conspirators."
</p>
<p>" We are perhaps more so than these gentlemen, al-
</p>
<p>though we dance," said Olivier d'Entraigues, who led her.
</p>
<p>" Ah ! your conspiracy is against me, M. le Page I "
</p>
<p>said Ninon, looking the while a.t another light-horseman,
</p>
<p>and abandoning her remaining arm to a third, the other
</p>
<p>gallants seeking to place themselves in the way of her
</p>
<p>flying ceillades, for she distributed her glances brilliant
</p>
<p>as the rays of the sun dancing over the moving waters.
</p>
<p>De Thou stole away without any one thinking of stop-
</p>
<p>ping him, and was descending the great staircase, when

<p>breath, who stopped him with an animated and joy-
</p>
<p>ous air.
</p>
<p>" How now ! whither go you ? Let the foreigners and
</p>
<p>savans go. You are one of us. I am somewhat late ;
</p>
<p>but our beautiful Aspasia will pardon me. Why are
</p>
<p>you going ? Is it all over ? "
</p>
<p>" Why, it seems so. When the dancing begins, the
</p>
<p>reading is done."
</p>
<p>" The reading, yes ; but the oaths ? " said the abbe",
</p>
<p>in a low voice.
</p>
<p>" What oaths ? " asked De Thou.
</p>
<p>" Is not M. le Grand come ? "
</p>
<p>" I expected to see him ; but I suppose he has not
</p>
<p>come, or else he has gone."
</p>
<p>" No, no ! come with me," said the hare-brained abbe".
</p>
<p>" You are one of us. Parbleu ! it is impossible to do
</p>
<p>without you ; come ! "
</p>
<p>De Thou, unwilling to refuse, and thus appear to dis-
</p>
<p>own his friends, even for parties of pleasure which an-
</p>
<p>noyed him, followed De Gondi, who passed through two
</p>
<p>cabinets, and descended a small private staircase. At
</p>
<p>each step he took, he heard more distinctly the voices
</p>
<p>of an assemblage of men. Gondi opened the door. An
</p>
<p>unexpected spectacle met his view.
</p>
<p>The chamber he was entering, lighted by a mysterious
</p>
<p>glimmer, seemed the asylum of the most voluptuous
</p>
<p>rendezvous. On one side was a gilt bed. with a canopy
</p>
<p>of tapestry ornamented with feathers, and covered with
</p>
<p>lace and ornaments. The furniture, shining with gold,
</p>
<p>was of grayish silk, richly embroidered. Velvet cush-

</p>
<p>ions were at the foot of each armchair, upon a thick
</p>
<p>124 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>carpet. Small mirrors, connected with one another by
</p>
<p>ornaments of silver, seemed an entire glass, itself a
</p>
<p>perfection then unknown, and everywhere multiplied
</p>
<p>their glittering faces. No sound from without could
</p>
<p>penetrate this throne of delight ; but the persons assem-
</p>
<p>bled there seemed far remote from the thoughts which
</p>
<p>it was calculated to give rise to. A number of men,
</p>
<p>whom he recognized as courtiers, or soldiers of rank,
</p>
<p>crowded the entrance of this chamber and an adjoining
</p>
<p>apartment of larger dimensions. All were intent upon
</p>
<p>that which was passing in the centre of the first room.
</p>
<p>Here, ten young men, standing, and holding in their
</p>
<p>hands their drawn swords, the points of which were low-
</p>
<p>ered towards the ground, were ranged round a table.
</p>
<p>Their faces, turned to Cinq-Mars, announced that they
</p>
<p>had just taken an oath to him. The grand e"cuyer stood
</p>
<p>by himself before the fireplace, his arms folded with
</p>
<p>an air of all-absorbing reflection. Standing near him,
</p>
<p>Marion de Lorme, grave and collected, seemed to have
</p>
<p>presented these gentlemen to him.
</p>
<p>When Cinq-Mars perceived his friend, he rushed
</p>
<p>towards the door, casting a terrible glance at Gondi,
</p>
<p>and seizing De Thou by both arms, stopped him on the
</p>
<p>last step.
</p>
<p>" What do you here ? " he said in a stifled voice.
</p>
<p>" Who brought you here ? What would you with me ?
</p>
<p>You are lost if you enter."
</p>
<p>" What do you yourself here ? What do I see in this
</p>
<p>house ? "

<p>" The consequences of that you wot of. Go ; this air

</p>
<p>" It is too late ; they have seen me. What would they
</p>
<p>say if I were to withdraw ? I should discourage them ;
</p>
<p>you would be lost."
</p>
<p>This dialogue had passed in low and hurried tones ;
</p>
<p>at the last word, De Thou, pushing aside his friend,
</p>
<p>entered, and with a firm step crossed the apartment to
</p>
<p>the fireplace.
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars, trembling with rage, resumed his place,
</p>
<p>hung his head, collected himself, and soon raising a
</p>
<p>more calm countenance, continued a discourse which
</p>
<p>the entrance of his friend had interrupted,
</p>
<p>" Be then with us, gentlemen ; there is no longer any
</p>
<p>need for so much mystery. Remember that when a
</p>
<p>strong mind embraces an idea, it must follow it to all
</p>
<p>its consequences. Your courage will have a wider field
</p>
<p>than that of a court intrigue. Thank me ; instead of a
</p>
<p>conspiracy, I give you a war. M. de Bouillon has de-
</p>
<p>parted to place himself at the head of his army of Italy ;
</p>
<p>in two days, and before the king, I quit Paris for Per-
</p>
<p>pignan. Come all of you thither ; the Royalists of the
</p>
<p>army await us."
</p>
<p>Here he threw around him calm and confident looks ;
</p>
<p>he saw gleams of joy and enthusiasm in the eyes of all
</p>
<p>who surrounded him. Before allowing his own heart
</p>
<p>to be possessed by the contagious emotion which pre-
</p>
<p>cedes great enterprises, he desired still more firmly to
</p>
<p>assure himself of them, and said with a grave air,
</p>
<p>" Yes, war, gentlemen ; think of it, open war. Rochelle
</p>
<p>and Navarre are arousing their Protestants ; the army
</p>
<p>of Italy will enter on one side ; the king's brother will

<p>join us on the other. The man we combat will be sur-

</p>
<p>rounded, vanquished, crushed. The parliaments will
</p>
<p>march in our rear, bearing their petitions to the king,
</p>
<p>a weapon as powerful as our swords ; and after the
</p>
<p>victory we will throw ourselves at the feet of Louis
</p>
<p>XIIL, our master, that he may pardon us for having
</p>
<p>delivered him from a cruel and ambitious man, and
</p>
<p>hastened his own resolution."
</p>
<p>Here, again glancing around him, he saw increas-
</p>
<p>ing confidence in the looks and attitudes of his
</p>
<p>accomplices.
</p>
<p>" How ! " he continued, crossing his arms, and yet
</p>
<p>restraining with an effort his own emotion ; " you do
</p>
<p>not recoil before this resolution, which would appear a
</p>
<p>revolt to any other men ! Do you not think that I have
</p>
<p>abused the powers you have vested in me ? I have car-
</p>
<p>ried matters very far ; but there are times when kings
</p>
<p>would be served, as it were in spite of themselves. All
</p>
<p>is arranged, as you know. Sedan will open its gates to
</p>
<p>us; and we are sure of Spain. Twelve thousand veteran
</p>
<p>troops will enter Paris with us. No place, however,
</p>
<p>will be given up to the foreigner; they will all have
</p>
<p>a French garrison, and be taken in the name of the
</p>
<p>king."
</p>
<p>" Long live the king ! long live the Union ! the new
</p>
<p>Union, the Holy League ! " cried the assembly.
</p>
<p>" It has come, then ! " cried Cinq-Mars, with enthu-
</p>
<p>siasm ; "it has come, the most glorious day of my
</p>
<p>life. Oh, youth, youth, from century to century called

</p>
<p>most vast, the most just, the most beneficial of enter-
</p>
<p>prises ? My friends, what is a great life but a thought
</p>
<p>of youth executed by mature age ? Youth looks fixedly
</p>
<p>into the future with its eagle glance, traces there a broad
</p>
<p>plan, lays the foundation stone ; and all that our entire
</p>
<p>existence afterwards can do is to approximate to that
</p>
<p>first design. Oh, when can great projects arise, if not
</p>
<p>when the heart beats vigorously in the breast ? The
</p>
<p>mind is not sufficient; it is but an instrument."
</p>
<p>A fresh outburst of joy had followed these words,
</p>
<p>when an old man with a white beard stood forward
</p>
<p>from the throng.
</p>
<p>" Bah ! " said Gondi, in a low voice, " here 's the old
</p>
<p>Chevalier de Guise going to dote and damp us."
</p>
<p>And truly enough, the old man, pressing the hand of
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars, said slowly and with difficulty, having placed
</p>
<p>himself near him,
</p>
<p>" Yes, my son, and you, my children, I see with joy
</p>
<p>that my old friend Bassompierre is about to be delivered
</p>

</p>
<p>Soissons and the young Montmorency. But it is expe-
</p>
<p>dient for youth, all ardent as it is, to listen to those who
</p>
<p>have seen much. I have witnessed the League, my chil-
</p>
<p>dren, and I tell you that you cannot now, as then, take
</p>
<p>the title of the Holy League, the Holy Union, the Pro-
</p>
<p>tectors of Saint Peter, or Pillars of the Church, because
</p>
<p>I see that you reckon on the support of the Huguenots ;
</p>
<p>nor can you put upon your great seal of green wax an
</p>
<p>empty throne, since it is occupied by a king."
</p>
<p>" You may say by two," interrupted Gondi, laughing.

</p>
<p>" Well, the War of the King," said Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>" Ay, the War of the King ! " cried Gondi and all
</p>
<p>the young men.
</p>
<p>" Moreover," continued the old seigneur, " it is essen-
</p>
<p>tial to gain the approval of the theological faculty of the
</p>
<p>Sorbonne, which heretofore sanctioned even the haut-
</p>
<p>yourdiers and the sorgueurs, 1 and to put in force its
</p>
<p>second proposition, that it is permitted to the people
</p>
<p>to disobey the magistrates, and to hang them."
</p>
<p>" Eh, Chevalier ! " exclaimed Gondi ; " this is not the
</p>
<p>question. Let M. le Grand speak ; we are thinking no
</p>
<p>more of the Sorbonne at present than of your Saint
</p>
<p>Jacques Clement."
</p>
<p>There was a laugh, and Cinq-Mars went on,
</p>
<p>" I wished, gentlemen, to conceal nothing from you as
</p>
<p>to the projects of Monsieur, tHose of the Due de Bouillon,
</p>
<p>or my own, for it is just that a man who stakes his life
</p>
<p>should know at what game ; but I have placed before
</p>
<p>you the least fortunate chances, and I have not detailed
</p>
<p>our strength, for there is not one of you but knows the

<p>secret of it. Is it to you, MM. de Montre"sor and de

</p>
<p>and in Auvergne, where lay the lands of the House of
</p>
<p>D'Effiat, and whence will march two thousand seigneurs,
</p>
<p>with their vassals ? Baron de Beauvau, shall I repeat
</p>
<p>to you the zeal and valor of the cuirassiers whom you
</p>
<p>brought to the unhappy Comte de Soissons, whose cause
</p>
<p>was ours, and whom you saw assassinated in the midst
</p>
<p>of his triumph by him whom with you he had defeated ?
</p>
<p>Shall I tell these gentlemen of the joy of the Count-
</p>
<p>Duke of Olivares at the news of our intentions, and the
</p>
<p>letters of the cardinal-infanta to the Due de Bouillon ?
</p>
<p>Shall I speak of Paris to the Abbs' de Gondi, to D'En-
</p>
<p>traigues, and to you, gentlemen, who are daily witnesses
</p>
<p>of her misery, of her indignation, and her desire to
</p>
<p>break forth ? While all foreign nations demand peace,
</p>
<p>which the Cardinal de Richelieu still destroys by his
</p>
<p>want of faith (as he has done in violating the treaty of
</p>
<p>Ratisbon), all orders of the State groan under his
</p>
<p>violence, and dread that colossal ambition which aspires
</p>
<p>to no less than the temporal and even spiritual throne
</p>
<p>of France."
</p>
<p>A murmur of approbation interrupted Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>There was then silence for a moment ; and they heard
</p>
<p>the sound of wind instruments, and the measured tread
</p>
<p>of the dancers.
</p>
<p>This noise caused a momentary diversion and a smile
</p>
<p>in the younger portion of the assembly.
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars profited by this ; and raising his eyes,
</p>
<p>" Pleasures of youth," he cried, " love, music, joyous
</p>
<p>dances, why do you not alone occupy our leisure hours?

<p>Why are not you our sole ambition ? What resentment

</p>
<p>may we not justly feel that we have to make our cries
</p>
<p>of indignation heard above our bursts of joy, our for-
</p>
<p>midable secrets in the asylum of love, and our oaths of
</p>
<p>war and death amid the intoxication of fetes and of
</p>
<p>life!
</p>
<p>" Curses on him who saddens the youth of a people !
</p>
<p>When wrinkles furrow the brow of the young men, we
</p>
<p>may confidently say that the finger of a tyrant has
</p>
<p>hollowed them out. The other troubles of youth give
</p>
<p>it despair and not consternation. Watch those sad and
</p>
<p>mournful students pass day after day with pale fore-
</p>
<p>heads, slow steps, and half-suppressed voices. One would
</p>
<p>think they fear to live or to advance a step towards
</p>
<p>the future. What is there then in France ? A man
</p>
<p>too many.
</p>
<p>" Yes," he continued ; " for two years I have watched
</p>
<p>the insidious and profound progress of his ambition.
</p>
<p>His strange practices, his secret commissions, his ju-
</p>
<p>dicial assassinations are known to you. Princes, peers,
</p>
<p>mare'chals, all have been crushed by him. There is
</p>
<p>not a family in France but can show some sad trace of
</p>
<p>his passage. If he regards us all as enemies to his au-
</p>
<p>thority, it is because he would have in France none
</p>
<p>but his own house, which twenty years ago held only
</p>
<p>one of the smallest fiefs of Poitou.

<p>unheard of, because they have raised their voices for

</p>
<p>" The highest offices of justice, who fill them ? Infa-
</p>
<p>mous and corrupt men, who suck the blood and gold of
</p>
<p>the country. Paris and the maritime towns taxed ; the
</p>
<p>rural districts ruined and laid waste by the soldiers and
</p>
<p>other agents of the cardinal ; the peasants reduced to
</p>
<p>feed on animals killed by the plague or famine, or sav-
</p>
<p>ing themselves by self-banishment, such is the work
</p>
<p>of this new justice. His worthy agents have even coined
</p>
<p>money with the effigy of the cardinal-due. Here are
</p>
<p>some of his royal pieces."
</p>
<p>The grand e*cuyer threw upon the table a score of
</p>
<p>gold doubloons whereon Richelieu was represented. A
</p>
<p>fresh murmur of hatred towards the cardinal arose in
</p>
<p>the apartment.
</p>
<p>" And think you the clergy are less trampled on and
</p>
<p>less discontented ? No. Bishops have been tried against
</p>
<p>the laws of the State and in contempt of the respect due
</p>
<p>to their sacred persons. We have seen, in consequence,
</p>
<p>Algerine corsairs commanded by an archbishop. Men
</p>
<p>of the lowest condition have been elevated to the cardi-
</p>
<p>nalate. The minister himself, devouring the most sacred
</p>
<p>things, has had himself elected general of the orders of
</p>
<p>Citeaux, Cluny, and Premontre', throwing into prison the
</p>
<p>monks who refused him their votes. Jesuits, Carmelites,
</p>
<p>Cordeliers, Augustins, Dominicans, have been forced to
</p>
<p>elect general vicars in France, in order no longer to
</p>
<p>communicate at Rome with their true superiors, be-
</p>
<p>cause he would be patriarch in France, and head of

</p>
<p>" He 's a schismatic ! a monster ! " cried several voices.
</p>
<p>" His progress, then, is apparent, gentlemen. He is
</p>
<p>ready to seize both temporal and spiritual power. He
</p>
<p>has little by little fortified himself against the king in
</p>
<p>the strongest towns of France, seized the mouths of
</p>
<p>the principal rivers, the best ports of the ocean, the salt-
</p>
<p>pits, and all the securities of the kingdom. It is the
</p>
<p>king, then, whom we must deliver from this oppression.
</p>
<p>' Lc roi et la paix ! ' shall be our cry. The rest must
</p>
<p>be left to Providence."
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars greatly astonished the assembly, and De
</p>
<p>Thou himself, by this address. No one had ever before
</p>
<p>heard him speak so long together, not even in fireside
</p>
<p>conversation ; and he had never by a single word shown
</p>
<p>the least aptitude for understanding public affairs. He
</p>
<p>had, on the contrary, affected the greatest indifference
</p>
<p>on the subject, even in the eyes of those whom he was
</p>
<p>moulding to his projects, merely manifesting a virtuous
</p>
<p>indignation at the violence of the minister, but affecting
</p>
<p>not to put forward any of his own ideas, in order not
</p>
<p>to suggest personal ambition as the aim of his labors.
</p>
<p>The confidence given to him rested on his favor with
</p>
<p>the king and his personal bravery. The surprise of all
</p>
<p>present was therefore such as to cause a momentary
</p>
<p>silence. It was soon broken by all the transports of
</p>
<p>Frenchmen, young or old, when fighting of whatever
</p>
<p>kind is held out to them.
</p>
<p>Among those who came forward to press the hand
</p>
<p>of the young party leader, the Abb6 de Gondi jumped
</p>
<p>about like a kid.

<p>"I have already enrolled my regiment ! " he cried. " I
</p>
<p>THE READING. 133
</p>
<p>have some superb fellows ! " Then, addressing Marion
</p>
<p>de Lorme, "Parbleu! Mademoiselle, I will wear your
</p>
<p>colors, your gray ribbon, and your order of the
</p>
<p>Allumette. The device is charming,
</p>
<p>' Nous ne brulons que pour bruler les autres.'
</p>
<p>And I wish you could see all the fine things we shall do
</p>
<p>if we are fortunate enough to come to blows."
</p>
<p>The fair Marion, who did not like him, began to talk
</p>
<p>over his head to M. de Thou, a mortification which
</p>
<p>always exasperated the little abbe, who accordingly ab-
</p>
<p>ruptly left her, walking as tall as he could, and scorn-
</p>
<p>fully twisting his mustache.
</p>
<p>All at once a sudden silence took possession of the
</p>
<p>assembly. A rolled paper had struck the ceiling and
</p>
<p>fallen at the feet of Cinq-Mars. He picked it up and
</p>
<p>unrolled it, after having looked eagerly around him. He
</p>
<p>sought in vain to divine whence it came ; all those who
</p>
<p>advanced had only astonishment and intense curiosity
</p>
<p>depicted in their faces.
</p>
<p>" Here is my name wrongly written," he said coldly.

</p>
<p>"There is a traitor among us, gentlemen," he said,
</p>
<p>throwing away the paper. " But no matter. We are
</p>
<p>not men to be frightened by his sanguinary jests."

</p>
<p>" We must find the traitor out, and throw him
</p>
<p>through the window," said the young men.
</p>
<p>Still, a disagreeable sensation had come over the
</p>
<p>assembly. They now only spoke in whispers, and each
</p>
<p>regarded his neighbor with distrust. Some withdrew ;
</p>
<p>the meeting grew thinner. Marion de Lorme repeated
</p>
<p>to every one that she would dismiss her servants, who
</p>
<p>alone could be suspected. Despite her efforts a coldness
</p>
<p>reigned throughout the apartment. The first sentences
</p>
<p>of Cinq-Mars's address, too, had left some uncertainty
</p>
<p>as to the intentions of the king ; and this untimely
</p>
<p>candor had somewhat shaken a few of the less deter-
</p>
<p>mined conspirators.
</p>
<p>Gondi pointed this out to Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>" Hark ye ! " he said in a low voice. " Believe me,
</p>
<p>I have carefully studied conspiracies and assemblages ;
</p>
<p>there are certain purely mechanical means which it is
</p>
<p>necessary to adopt. Follow my advice here ; I know a
</p>
<p>good deal of this sort of thing. They want something
</p>
<p>more. Give them a little contradiction ; that always
</p>
<p>succeeds in France. You will quite make them alive
</p>
<p>again. Seem not to want to retain them against their
</p>
<p>will, and they will remain."
</p>
<p>The grand e"cuyer approved of the suggestion, and
</p>
<p>advancing towards those whom he knew to be most
</p>
<p>deeply compromised, said,
</p>
<p>" For the rest, gentlemen, I do not wish to force any
</p>
<p>one to follow me. Plenty of brave men await us at
</p>
<p>Perpignan, and all France is with us. If any one desires
</p>
<p>to secure himself a retreat, let him speak. We will give

</p>
<p>Not one would hear of this proposition ; and the
</p>
<p>movement it occasioned produced a renewal of the
</p>
<p>oaths of hatred against the minister.
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars, however, proceeded to put the question in-
</p>
<p>dividually to some of the persons present, in the election
</p>
<p>of whom he showed much judgment; for he ended with
</p>
<p>Montre*sor, who cried that he would pass his sword
</p>
<p>through his body if he had for a moment entertained
</p>
<p>such an idea, and with Gondi, who, rising fiercely on
</p>
<p>his heels, exclaimed,
</p>
<p>" M. le Grand Ecuyer, my retreat is the archbishop-
</p>
<p>ric of Paris and L'lle Notre-Dame. I '11 make it a place
</p>
<p>strong enough to keep me from being taken."
</p>
<p>" And yours ? " he said to De Thou.
</p>
<p>" At your side," murmured De Thou, lowering his
</p>
<p>eyes, unwilling even to give importance to his resolution
</p>
<p>by the proneness of his look.
</p>
<p>" You will have it so ? Well ! I accept," said Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars ; " and my sacrifice herein, dear friend, is greater
</p>
<p>than yours." Then turning towards the assembly,
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, I see in you the last men of France, for
</p>
<p>after the Montmorencys and the Soissons, you alone
</p>
<p>dare lift a head free and worthy of our old liberty. If
</p>
<p>Richelieu triumph, the ancient bases of the monarchy
</p>
<p>will crumble with us. The court will reign alone, in
</p>
<p>the place of the parliaments, the old barriers, and at
</p>
<p>the same time the powerful supports of the royal au-
</p>
<p>thority. Let us be conquerors, and France will owe
</p>
<p>to us the preservation of her ancient manners and

<p>her time-honored guarantees. And now, gentlemen,

</p>
<p>IT was the day following the assembly that had taken
</p>
<p>place in the house of Marion de Lorme. A thick snow
</p>
<p>covered the roofs of Paris and settled in its large gutters
</p>
<p>and streets, where it arose in gray heaps, furrowed by
</p>
<p>the wheels of carriages.
</p>
<p>It was eight o'clock, and the night was dark. The
</p>
<p>tumult of the city was silent on account of the thick
</p>
<p>carpet the winter had spread for it, and which deadened
</p>
<p>the sound of the wheels over the stones, and of the feet
</p>
<p>of men and horses. In a narrow street that winds
</p>
<p>round the old church of St. Eustache, a man, enveloped
</p>
<p>in his cloak, slowly walked up and down, constantly
</p>
<p>watching for the appearance of some one. He often
</p>
<p>seated himself upon one of the posts of the church,
</p>
<p>sheltering himself from the falling snow under one of

</p>
<p>the building, stretching over the narrow path like birds
</p>
<p>of prey, which, about to make a stoop, have folded their
</p>
<p>wings. Often, too, the old man, opening his cloak, beat
</p>
<p>his arms against his breast to warm himself, or blew
</p>
<p>upon his fingers, ill protected from the cold by a pair
</p>
<p>of buff gloves reaching nearly to the elbow. At last he
</p>
<p>saw a slight shadow gliding along the wall.
</p>
<p>" Ah, Santa Maria ! what villanous countries are these
</p>
<p>of the North ! " said a woman's voice, trembling. " Ah,
</p>
<p>the duchy of Mantua ! would I were back there again,
</p>
<p>Grandchamp ! "
</p>
<p>" Pshaw ! don't speak so loud," said the old domestic,
</p>
<p>abruptly. " The walls of Paris have Cardinalist ears,
</p>
<p>and more especially the walls of the churches. Has
</p>
<p>your mistress entered ? My master awaits her at the
</p>
<p>door."
</p>
<p>" Yes, yes ; she has gone in."
</p>
<p>" Be silent," said Grandchamp. " The sound of the
</p>
<p>clock is cracked. That 's a bad sign."
</p>
<p>" That clock has sounded the hour of a rendezvous."
</p>
<p>" For me, it sounds like a passing-bell. But be silent,
</p>
<p>Laure ; here are three cloaks passing."
</p>
<p>They allowed three men to pass. Grandchamp fol-
</p>
<p>lowed them, made sure of the road they took, and re-
</p>
<p>turned to his seat, sighing deeply.
</p>
<p>" The snow is cold, Laure, and I am old. M. le Grand
</p>
<p>might have chosen another of his men to keep watch for
</p>
<p>him while he 's making love. It 's all very well for you

<p>" Has your master arrived long, caro amico ? "

<p>" Eh, cara, caro ! leave me in peace. We had both

<p>been freezing for an hour when you came. I should

<p>have had time to smoke three Turkish pipes. Attend

</p>
<p>beat about well."
</p>
<p>" Ah, what a thing it is to have no one to whom to
</p>
<p>say a friendly word when it is so cold ! and my poor
</p>
<p>mistress ! to come on foot all the way from the Hotel
</p>
<p>de Nevers. Ah, amore ! qui regna amore ! "
</p>
<p>" Come, Italian, wheel about, I tell thee. Let me hear
</p>
<p>no more of thy musical tongue."
</p>
<p>" Ah, Santa Maria ! What a harsh voice, dear Grand-
</p>
<p>champ ! You were much more amiable at Chaumont,
</p>
<p>in Turena, when you talked to me of miei occhi neri"
</p>
<p>" Hold thy tongue, prattler ! Once more, thy Italian
</p>
<p>is only good for buffoons and rope-dancers, or to accom-
</p>
<p>pany the learned dogs."
</p>
<p>" Ah, Italia mia ! Grandchamp, listen to me, and
</p>
<p>you shall hear the language of the gods. If you were
</p>
<p>a gallant man, like him who wrote this for a Laure
</p>
<p>like me ! "
</p>
<p>And she began to hum,

<p>140 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>The old soldier was but little used to the voice of a
</p>
<p>young girl ; and in general when a woman spoke to
</p>
<p>him, the tone he assumed in answering always fluctu-
</p>
<p>ated between an awkward compliment and an ebullition
</p>
<p>of temper. But on this occasion he appeared moved by
</p>
<p>the Italian song, and twisted his mustache, which was
</p>
<p>always with him a sign of embarrassment and distress.
</p>
<p>He even emitted a rough sound something like a laugh,
</p>
<p>and said,
</p>
<p>" Pretty enough, mordieu ! that recalls to my mind
</p>
<p>the siege of Casal ; but be silent, little one. I have not
</p>
<p>yet heard the Abbe* Quillet come. This troubles me.
</p>
<p>He ought to have been here before our two young
</p>
<p>people ; and for some time past "
</p>
<p>Laure, who was afraid of being sent alone to the
</p>
<p>Place St. Eustache, answered that she was quite sure
</p>
<p>he had gone in, and continued,
</p>
<p>" Ombrose selve, ove percote il sole
</p>
<p>Che vi fa co' suoi raggi alte e superbe."
</p>
<p>" Hum ! " said the worthy old soldier, grumbling. " I
</p>
<p>have my feet in the snow, and a gutter runs down on
</p>
<p>my head, and there 's death at my heart ; and you sing to
</p>
<p>me of violets, of the sun, and of grass, and of love. Be
</p>
<p>silent ! "
</p>
<p>And retiring farther in the recess of the church, he
</p>
<p>leaned his gray head upon his hands, pensive and mo-
</p>
<p>tionless. Laure dared not again speak to him.
</p>
<p>While her waiting-woman had gone to find Grand-
</p>
<p>champ, the young and trembling Marie with a timid

<p>hand had pushed open the folding-door of the church.
</p>
<p>THE CONFESSIONAL. 141
</p>
<p>She there found Cinq-Mars standing, disguised, and anx-
</p>
<p>iously awaiting her. As soon as she recognized him,
</p>
<p>she advanced with rapid steps into the church, holding
</p>
<p>her velvet mask over her face, and hastened to take
</p>
<p>refuge in a confessional, while Henri carefully closed
</p>
<p>the door of the church by which she had entered. He
</p>
<p>made sure that it could not be opened on the outside,
</p>
<p>and then followed his betrothed to kneel within the place
</p>
<p>of penitence. Arrived an hour before her, with his old
</p>
<p>valet, he had found this open, - a certain and understood
</p>
<p>sign that the Abbd Quillet, his tutor, awaited him at the
</p>
<p>accustomed place. His care to prevent any surprise
</p>
<p>had made him remain himself to guard the entrance
</p>
<p>until the arrival of Marie. Delighted as he was at the
</p>
<p>punctuality of the good abbe", he would still scarcely
</p>
<p>leave his post to thank him. He was a second father to
</p>
<p>him in all but authority ; and he acted towards the good
</p>
<p>priest without much ceremony.
</p>
<p>The old parish church of St. Eustache was dark. Be-
</p>
<p>sides the perpetual lamp, there were only f our flambeaux
</p>
<p>of yellow wax, which, attached above the fonts against
</p>
<p>the principal pillars, cast a red glimmer upon the blue
</p>
<p>and black marble of the empty church. The light
</p>
<p>scarcely penetrated the deep niches of the aisles of the
</p>
<p>sacred building. In one of the chapels the darkest of
</p>
<p>them was the confessional, of which we have before
</p>
<p>spoken, whose high iron grating and thick double planks
</p>
<p>left visible only the small dome and the wooden cross.
</p>
<p>Here on either side, knelt Cinq-Mars and Marie de
</p>
<p>Mantua. They could scarcely see each other, but found

</p>
<p>that the Abb Quillet, seated between them, was there
</p>
<p>142 CINQ-MARS,
</p>
<p>awaiting them. They could see through the little grat-
</p>
<p>ing the shadow of his hood. Henri d'Effiat approached
</p>
<p>slowly ; he was regulating, as it were, the remainder
</p>
<p>of his destiny. It was not before his king that he was
</p>
<p>about to appear, but before a more powerful sovereign,
</p>
<p>before her for whom he had undertaken his immense
</p>
<p>work. He was about to test her faith ; and he trembled.
</p>
<p>He trembled still more when his young betrothed
</p>
<p>knelt opposite to him ; he trembled, because at the
</p>
<p>sight of this angel he could not help feeling all the hap-
</p>
<p>piness he might lose. He dared not speak first, and
</p>
<p>remained for an instant contemplating her head in the
</p>
<p>shade, that young head upon which rested all his hopes.
</p>
<p>Despite his love, whenever he looked upon her he could
</p>
<p>not refrain from a kind of dread at having undertaken
</p>
<p>so much for a girl, whose passion was but a feeble re-
</p>
<p>flection of his own, and who perhaps would not appre-
</p>
<p>ciate all the sacrifices he had made for her, bending
</p>
<p>the firm character of his mind to the compliances of a
</p>
<p>courtier, condemning it to the intrigues and sufferings
</p>
<p>of ambition, abandoning it to profound combinations, to
</p>
<p>criminal meditations, to the gloomy labors of a con-
</p>
<p>spirator. Hitherto, in their chaste and secret inter-
</p>
<p>views,' she had always received each fresh intelligence
</p>
<p>of his progress with the transports of pleasure of a
</p>
<p>child, but without appreciating the labors of each of
</p>
<p>these so arduous steps that lead to honors, and always
</p>
<p>asking him with naivet6 when he would be constable,
</p>
<p>and when they should marry, as if she were asking him
</p>
<p>when he would come to the Carousel, or whether the

<p>weather was fine. Hitherto, he had smiled at these
</p>
<p>THE CONFESSIONAL. 143
</p>
<p>questions and this ignorance, pardonable at eighteen, in
</p>
<p>a girl born to a throne and accustomed to a grandeur,
</p>
<p>natural to her, which she found around her on her en-
</p>
<p>trance into life ; but now he made more serious reflec-
</p>
<p>tions upon this character. And when, but just quitting
</p>
<p>the imposing assembly of conspirators, representatives
</p>
<p>of all the orders of the kingdom, his ear, wherein still
</p>
<p>resounded the masculine voices that had sworn to under-
</p>
<p>take a vast war, was struck with the first words of her
</p>
<p>for whom that war was commenced, he feared for the
</p>
<p>first time lest this naivetd should be in reality simple
</p>
<p>levity, not coming from the heart. He resolved to
</p>
<p>sound it.
</p>
<p>" Oh, heavens ! how I tremble, Henri ! " she said as
</p>
<p>she entered the confessional ; " you make me come
</p>
<p>without guards, without a coach. I always tremble lest
</p>
<p>I should be seen by my people coming out of the H6tel de
</p>
<p>Nevers. How much longer must I yet conceal myself
</p>
<p>like a criminal ? The queen was very angry when I
</p>
<p>avowed the matter to her ; and whenever she speaks to
</p>
<p>me of it, 'tis with her severe air that you know, and
</p>
<p>which always makes me weep. Oh, I am terribly
</p>
<p>afraid ! "
</p>
<p>She was silent ; Cinq-Mars replied only with a deep
</p>
<p>sigh.
</p>
<p>" How ! you do not speak to me ! " she said.
</p>
<p>" Are these, then, all your terrors ? " asked Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars, bitterly.
</p>
<p>" Can I have greater ? Oh, man ami, in what a tone,
</p>
<p>with what a voice do you address me ! Are .you angry

<p>because I came too late ? "
</p>
<p>144 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" Too soon, Madame, much too soon, for the things
</p>
<p>you are to hear, for I see you are far from prepared
</p>
<p>for them."
</p>
<p>Marie, affected at the gloomy and bitter tone of his
</p>
<p>voice, began to weep.
</p>
<p>"Alas, what have I done," she said, "that you should
</p>
<p>call me Madame, and treat me thus harshly ? "
</p>
<p>" Be tranquil," replied Cinq-Mars, but with irony in
</p>
<p>his tone. " 'T is not, indeed, you who are guilty ; but I,
</p>
<p>I alone; not towards you, but for you."
</p>
<p>" Have you done wrong, then ? Have you ordered the
</p>
<p>death of any one ? Oh, no, I am sure you have not, you
</p>
<p>are so good ! "
</p>
<p>" What ! " said Cinq-Mars, " are you as nothing in
</p>
<p>my designs ? Did I misconstrue your thoughts when you
</p>
<p>looked at me in the queen's boudoir ? Can I no longer
</p>
<p>read in your eyes ? Was the fire which animated them
</p>
<p>that of a love for Richelieu ? That admiration which you
</p>
<p>promised to him who should dare to say all to the king,
</p>
<p>where is it ? Is it all a falsehood ? "
</p>
<p>Marie .burst into tears.
</p>
<p>" You still speak to me with bitterness," she said ; " I
</p>
<p>have not deserved it. Do you suppose, because I speak
</p>
<p>not of this fearful conspiracy, that I have forgotten it ?
</p>
<p>Do you not see me miserable at the thought ? Must you
</p>
<p>see my tears ? Behold them ; I shed enough in secret.
</p>
<p>Henri, believe that if I have avoided this terrible subject
</p>
<p>in our last interviews, it is from the fear of learning too
</p>
<p>much. Have I any other thought than that of your

<p>danger ? Do I not know that it is for me you incur

<p>them ? Alas ! if you fight for me, have I not also to
</p>
<p>THE CONFESSIONAL. 145
</p>
<p>sustain attacks no less cruel ? Happier than I, you have
</p>
<p>only to combat hatred, while I struggle against friend-
</p>
<p>ship. The cardinal will oppose to you men and weapons ;
</p>
<p>but the queen, the gentle Anne of Austria, employs only
</p>
<p>tender advice, caresses, sometimes tears."
</p>
<p>"Touching and invincible constraint to make you
</p>
<p>accept a throne," said Cinq-Mars, bitterly. " I well con-
</p>
<p>ceive you must need some efforts to resist such seduc-
</p>
<p>tions ; but first, Madame, I must release you from your
</p>
<p>vows."
</p>
<p>" Alas, Great Heaven ! what is there, then, against
</p>
<p>us?"
</p>
<p>" There is God above us, and against us," replied
</p>
<p>Henri, in a severe tone ; " the king has deceived
</p>
<p>me."
</p>
<p>There was an agitated movement on the part of the
</p>
<p>abbe\
</p>
<p>Marie exclaimed, " I foresaw it ; this is the mis-
</p>
<p>fortune I dreamed and dreamed of ! Is it I who caused
</p>
<p>it?"
</p>
<p>" He deceived me, as he pressed my hand," continued
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars ; " he betrayed me by the villain Joseph,
</p>
<p>whom an offer has been made to me to poniard."
</p>
<p>The abb gave a start of horror which half opened
</p>
<p>the door of the confessional.
</p>
<p>" Oh, Father, fear nothing," said Henri d'Effiat; "your
</p>
<p>pupil will never strike such blows. Those I prepare
</p>
<p>will be heard from afar, and the broad day will light
</p>
<p>them up ; but there remains a duty a sacred duty
</p>
<p>for me to fulfil. Behold your son sacrifice himself be-

</p>
<p>happiness, and I am about, perhaps, to destroy it by
</p>
<p>your hand, that consecrated it."
</p>
<p>As he spoke, he opened the light grating which sepa-
</p>
<p>rated him from his old tutor ; the latter, still observ-
</p>
<p>ing an extraordinary silence, passed his hood over
</p>
<p>his forehead.
</p>
<p>" Restore this nuptial ring to the Duchesse de Man-
</p>
<p>tua," said Cinq-Mars, in a tone less firm ; " I cannot
</p>
<p>keep it unless she give it me a second time, for I am
</p>
<p>not the same whom she promised to espouse."
</p>
<p>The priest hastily seized the ring, and passed it
</p>
<p>through the opposite grating ; this mark of indiffer-
</p>
<p>ence astonished Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>"What! Father," he said, "are you also changed?"
</p>
<p>Marie wept no longer ; but raising her angelic voice,
</p>
<p>which awakened a faint echo along the aisles of the
</p>
<p>church, as the softest sigh of the organ, she said, re-
</p>
<p>turning the ring to Cinq-Mars,
</p>
<p>" Oh, dearest, be not angry ! I comprehend you not.
</p>
<p>Can we break asunder what God has just united, and
</p>
<p>can I leave you, when I know you are unhappy ? If the
</p>
<p>king no longer loves you, at least you may be assured
</p>
<p>he will not harm you, since he has not harmed the car-
</p>
<p>dinal, whom he never loved. Do you think yourself
</p>
<p>undone, because he is perhaps unwilling to separate
</p>
<p>from his old servant ? Well, let us await the return
</p>
<p>of his friendship ; forget these conspirators, who affright
</p>
<p>me. If they give up hope, I shall thank Heaven, for

<p>then I shall no longer tremble for you. Why needlessly

<p>afflict ourselves ? The queen loves us, and we are both

</p>
<p>since we are united, and sure of ourselves. Tell me
</p>
<p>what the king said to you at Chambord. I followed
</p>
<p>you long w r ith my eyes. Heavens ! how sad to me was
</p>
<p>that hunting party ! "
</p>
<p>" He has betrayed me, I tell you," answered Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars. " Yet who could have believed it, that saw him
</p>
<p>press our hands, turning from his brother to me, and to
</p>
<p>the Due de Bouillon, making himself acquainted with
</p>
<p>the minutest details of the conspiracy, of the very day
</p>
<p>on which Richelieu was to be arrested at Lyons, fixing
</p>
<p>himself the place of his exile (our party desired his
</p>
<p>death, but the recollection of my father made me ask
</p>
<p>his life). The king said that he himself would direct
</p>
<p>the whole affair at Perpignan ; yet just before, Joseph,
</p>
<p>that foul spy, had issued from out of the cabinet du Lys.
</p>
<p>Oh, Marie ! shall I own it? at the moment I heard this,
</p>
<p>my very soul was tossed. I doubted everything ; it
</p>
<p>seemed to me that the centre of the world was unhinged
</p>
<p>w r hen I found truth quit the heart of the king. I saw
</p>
<p>our whole edifice crumble to the ground ; another hour,
</p>
<p>and the conspiracy would vanish away, and I should lose
</p>
<p>you forever. One means remained ; I employed it."
</p>
<p>" What means ? " said Marie.
</p>
<p>" The treaty with Spain was in my hand ; I signed
</p>
<p>it."
</p>
<p>" Ah, heavens ! destroy it."
</p>
<p>" It is gone."

</p>
<p>said Cinq-Mars, rising up. " All is ready at Madrid, all
</p>
<p>at Sedan. Armies await me, Marie, armies ! Riche-
</p>
<p>lieu is in the midst of them. He totters ; it needs but
</p>
<p>one blow to overthrow him, and you are mine forever.
</p>
<p>forever the wife of the triumphant Cinq-Mars."
</p>
<p>" Of Cinq-Mars the rebel," she said, sighing.
</p>
<p>" Well, have it so, the rebel ; but no longer the favor-
</p>
<p>ite. Rebel, criminal, worthy of the scaffold, I know it,"
</p>
<p>cried the impassioned youth, falling on his knees ; " but
</p>
<p>a rebel for love, a rebel for you, whom my sword will at
</p>
<p>last achieve for me."
</p>
<p>" Alas, a sword imbrued in the blood of his country !
</p>
<p>Is it not a poniard ? "
</p>
<p>" Pause ! for pity, pause, Marie ! Let kings abandon
</p>
<p>me. let warriors forsake me, I shall only be the more
</p>
<p>firm ; but a word from you will vanquish me, and once
</p>
<p>again the time for reflection will be passed from me.
</p>
<p>Yes, I am a criminal ; and that is why I still hesitate to
</p>
<p>think myself worthy of you. Abandon me, Marie ; take
</p>
<p>back the ring."
</p>
<p>" I cannot," she said ; " for I am your wife, whatever
</p>
<p>you be."
</p>
<p>" You hear her, Father ! " exclaimed Cinq-Mars, trans-
</p>
<p>ported with happiness ; " bless this second union, the
</p>
<p>work of devotion, even more beautiful than that of love.
</p>
<p>Let her be mine while I live."
</p>
<p>Without answering, the abb6 opened the door of the
</p>
<p>confessional and had quitted the church ere Cinq- Mars
</p>
<p>had time to rise and follow him.

</p>
<p>But no one answered.
</p>
<p>" Do not call out, in the name of Heaven ! " said Marie,
</p>
<p>" or I am lost ; he has doubtless heard some one in the
</p>
<p>church."
</p>
<p>But D'Effiat, agitated, and without answering her,
</p>
<p>rushed forth, and sought his late tutor through the
</p>
<p>church, but in vain. Drawing his sword, he proceeded
</p>
<p>to the entrance which Grandchamp had to guard; he
</p>
<p>called him and listened.
</p>
<p>" Now let him go," said a voice at the corner of the
</p>
<p>street ; and at the same moment was heard the galloping
</p>
<p>of horses.
</p>
<p>" Grandchamp, wilt thou answer ? " cried Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>" Help, Henri, my dear boy ! " exclaimed the voice of
</p>
<p>the Abbe Quillet.
</p>
<p>" Whence come you ? You endanger me," said the
</p>
<p>grand e*cuyer, approaching him.
</p>
<p>But he saw that his poor tutor, without a hat in the
</p>
<p>falling snow, was in a most deplorable condition.
</p>
<p>" They stopped me, and they robbed me," he cried.
</p>
<p>" The villains, the assassins ! they prevented me from call-
</p>
<p>ing out ; they stopped my mouth with a handkerchief."
</p>
<p>At this noise, Grandchamp at length came rubbing
</p>
<p>his eyes, like one just awakened. Laure, terrified, ran
</p>

</p>
<p>these windings; man himself can with difficulty stand
</p>
<p>upright there, even with the hempen boots, which can-
</p>
<p>not slip, and the hook of the pike-staff to force into
</p>
<p>the crevices of the rocks.
</p>
<p>In the fine summer months the pastour, in his brown
</p>
<p>cape, and his black long-bearded ram lead hither flocks,
</p>
<p>whose flowing wool sweeps the turf. Nothing is heard
</p>
<p>in these rugged places but the sound of the large bells
</p>
<p>which the sheep carry, and whose irregular tinklings
</p>
<p>produce unexpected harmonies, casual gamuts, which
</p>
<p>astonish the traveller and delight the savage and silent
</p>
<p>shepherd. But when the long month of September
</p>
<p>comes, a shroud of snow spreads itself from the peak of
</p>
<p>the mountains down to their base, respecting only this
</p>
<p>deeply excavated path, a few gorges opened by torrents,
</p>
<p>and some rocks of granite, which stretch out their fan-
</p>
<p>tastical forms, like the bones of a buried world.
</p>
<p>It is then that light troops of chamois make their
</p>
<p>appearance, with their twisted horns extending over
</p>
<p>their backs, spring from rock to rock as if driven before
</p>
<p>the wind, and take possession of their aerial desert.
</p>
<p>Flights of ravens and crows incessantly wheel round and
</p>
<p>round in the gulfs and natural wells which they trans-
</p>
<p>form into dark dovecots, while the brown bear, followed
</p>
<p>by her shaggy family, who sport and tumble around her
</p>
<p>in the snow, slowly descends from their retreat invaded
</p>
<p>by the frost. But these are neither the most savage nor
</p>
<p>the most cruel inhabitants that winter brings into these
</p>
<p>mountains ; the daring smuggler raises for himself a
</p>

</p>
<p>are made between the two Navarres, amid fogs and
</p>
<p>winds.
</p>
<p>It was in this narrow path on the frontiers of France
</p>
<p>that, about two months after the scenes we have wit-
</p>
<p>nessed in Paris, two travellers, coming from Spain,
</p>
<p>stopped at midnight, fatigued and dismayed. They
</p>
<p>heard musket-shots in the mountain.
</p>
<p>" The scoundrels ! how they have pursued us ! " said
</p>
<p>one of them. " I can go no farther ; but for you I should
</p>
<p>have been taken."
</p>
<p>" And you will be taken still, as well as that infernal
</p>
<p>paper, if you lose your time in words ; there is another
</p>
<p>volley on the rock of St. Pierre-de-1'Aigle. Up there,
</p>
<p>they suppose we have gone in the direction of the Lirna-
</p>
<p>c,on ; but, below, they will see the contrary. Descend ;
</p>
<p>it is doubtless a patrol hunting smugglers. Descend."
</p>
<p>" But how ? I cannot see."
</p>
<p>" Never mind, descend. Take my arm."
</p>
<p>"Hold me ; my boots slip," said the first traveller,
</p>
<p>stamping on the edge of the rock to make sure of the
</p>
<p>solidity of the ground before trusting himself upon it.
</p>
<p>" Go on ; go on ! " said the other, pushing him.
</p>
<p>" There 's one of the rascals passing over our heads."
</p>
<p>And, in fact, the shadow of a man, armed with a long
</p>
<p>gun, was reflected on the snow. The two adventurers
</p>
<p>stood motionless. The man passed on. They contin-
</p>
<p>ued their descent.
</p>
<p>" They will take us," said the one who was support-
</p>
<p>ing the other. " They have turned us. Give me your

<p>gler, and I can pass for one seeking an asylum among
</p>
<p>154 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>them ; but you would have no resource with your laced
</p>
<p>dress."
</p>
<p>" You are right," said his companion ; and resting his
</p>
<p>foot against the edge of the rock, and reclining on the
</p>
<p>slope, he gave him a roll of hollow wood.
</p>
<p>A gun was fired ; and a ball buried itself, hissing, in
</p>
<p>the snow at their feet.
</p>
<p>" Marked ! " said the first. " Roll down. If you are
</p>
<p>not dead when you get to the bottom, take the road you
</p>
<p>see before you. On the left of the hollow is Santa
</p>
<p>Maria. But turn to the right ; cross Oleron ; and you
</p>
<p>are on the road to Pau and are saved. Go ; roll down."
</p>
<p>As he spoke, he pushed his comrade, and without
</p>
<p>condescending to look after him, and himself neither
</p>
<p>ascending nor descending, followed the flank of the
</p>
<p>mountain horizontally, hanging on by rocks, branches,
</p>
<p>and even by plants, with the strength and energy of a
</p>
<p>wild-cat, and soon found himself on firm ground before
</p>
<p>a small wooden hut, through which a light was visible.
</p>
<p>The adventurer went all round it, like a hungry wolf
</p>
<p>round a sheep-fold, and applying his eye to one of the
</p>
<p>openings, apparently saw what determined him, for
</p>
<p>without further hesitation he pushed the tottering door,
</p>
<p>which was not even fastened by a latch. The whole hut
</p>
<p>shook with the blow he had given it. He then saw that
</p>
<p>it was divided into two cabins by a partition. A large
</p>
<p>flambeau of yellow wax lighted the first. There, a
</p>
<p>young girl, pale and fearfully thin, was crouched in a
</p>
<p>corner on the damp floor, just where the melted snow
</p>
<p>ran under the planks of the cottage. Very long black

<p>over her coarse brown dress ; the red hood of the
</p>
<p>Pyrenees covered her head and shoulders. Her eyes
</p>
<p>were cast down ; and she was spinning with a small
</p>
<p>distaff attached to her waist. The entry of a man did
</p>
<p>not appear to move her in the least.
</p>
<p>" Ha ! la moza, 1 get up and give me something to
</p>
<p>.drink. I am tired and thirsty."
</p>
<p>The young girl did not answer, and without raising
</p>
<p>her eyes, continued to spin assiduously.
</p>
<p>" Dost hear ? " said the stranger, thrusting her with
</p>
<p>his foot. " Go and tell thy master that a friend wishes
</p>
<p>to see him ; but first give me some drink. I shall sleep
</p>
<p>here."
</p>
<p>She answered in a hoarse voice, still spinning,
</p>
<p>" I drink the snow that melts on the rock, or the
</p>
<p>green scum that floats on the water of the swamp. But
</p>
<p>when I have spun well, they give me water from the
</p>
<p>iron spring. When I sleep, the cold lizard crawls over
</p>
<p>my face; but when I have well cleaned a mule, they
</p>
<p>throw me hay. The hay is warm ; the hay is good
</p>
<p>and warm. I put it under my marble feet."
</p>
<p>" What tale art telling me ? " said Jacques. " I spoke
</p>
<p>not of thee."
</p>
<p>She continued,
</p>
<p>" They make me hold a man while they kill him. Oh,
</p>
<p>what blood I have had on my hands ! God forgive
</p>
<p>them ! if that be possible. They make me hold his
</p>
<p>head, and the bucket filled with crimson water. Oh,

<p>Heaven ! I, who was the bride of God ! They throw

<p>finds them ; he lines his nest with their hair. I now see
</p>
<p>thee full of life ; I shall see thee bloody, pale, and dead."
</p>
<p>The adventurer, shrugging his shoulders, began to
</p>
<p>whistle as he passed the second door. Within he found
</p>
<p>the man he had seen through the chinks of the cabin.
</p>
<p>He wore the blue berret cap of the Basques on one side,
</p>
<p>and, enveloped in an ample cloak, seated on the pack-
</p>
<p>saddle of a mule, and bending over a large brazier,
</p>
<p>smoked a cigar, and from time to time drank from a
</p>
<p>leather bottle at his side. The light of the brazier
</p>
<p>showed his full yellow face, as well as the chamber,
</p>
<p>in which mule-saddles were ranged round the brasero as
</p>
<p>seats. He raised his head without altering his position.
</p>
<p>" Oh, oh ! is it thou, Jacques ? " he said. " Is it
</p>
<p>thou ? Although 't is four years since I saw thee, I rec-
</p>
<p>ognize thee. Thou art not changed, brigand ! There
</p>
<p>'t is still, thy great knave's face. Sit down there, and
</p>
<p>take a drink."
</p>
<p>" Yes, here I am. But how the devil earnest thou
</p>
<p>here ? I thought thou wert a judge, Houmain ! "
</p>
<p>" And I thought thou wert a Spanish captain,
</p>
<p>Jacques ! "
</p>
<p>" Ah ! I was so for a time, and then a prisoner. But
</p>
<p>I got out of the thing very snugly, and have taken again
</p>
<p>to the old trade, the free life, the good smuggling
</p>
<p>work."
</p>
<p>" Viva ! viva ! Jaleo ! " l cried Houmain. " We brave
</p>
<p>fellows can turn our hands to everything. Thou earnest
</p>
<p>by the other passes, I suppose, for I have not seen thee
</p>
<p>since I returned to the trade."

</p>
<p>" Yes, yes ; I have passed where thou wilt never pass,"
</p>
<p>said Jacques.
</p>
<p>" And what hast got ? "
</p>
<p>" A new merchandise. My mules will come to-
</p>
<p>morrow."
</p>
<p>" Silk sashes, cigars, or linen ? "
</p>
<p>" Thou wilt know in time, amigo" said the ruffian.
</p>
<p>" Give me the skin. I 'm thirsty."
</p>
<p>" Here, drink. It 's true Valdepenas ! We 're so
</p>
<p>jolly here, we bandoleros ! Ay ! jaleo ! jaleo ! come,
</p>
<p>drink ; our friends are coming."
</p>
<p>" What friends ? " said Jacques, dropping the horn.
</p>
<p>" Don't be uneasy, but drink. I '11 tell thee all about
</p>
<p>it presently, and then we '11 sing the Andalusian
</p>
<p>Tirana." 1
</p>
<p>The adventurer took the horn, and assumed an ap-
</p>
<p>pearance of ease.
</p>
<p>" And who 's that great she-devil I saw out there ? "
</p>
<p>he said. " She seems half dead."
</p>
<p>" Oh, no ! she 's only mad. Drink ; I '11 tell thee all
</p>
<p>about her."
</p>
<p>And taking from his red sash a long poniard denticu-
</p>
<p>lated on each side like a saw, Houmain used it to stir up
</p>
<p>the fire, and said with vast gravity,
</p>
<p>" Thou must know first, if thou dost not know it
</p>
<p>already, that down below there [he pointed towards
</p>
<p>France] , the old wolf Richelieu carries all before him."

</p>
<p>strong as he, and whom they call M. le Grand. This
</p>
<p>young fellow commands almost the whole army of Per-
</p>
<p>pignan at this moment. He arrived there a month ago ;
</p>
<p>but the old fox is still at Narbonne, a very cunning
</p>
<p>fox indeed. As to the king, he is sometimes this, some-
</p>
<p>times that [as he spoke, Houmain turned his hand out-
</p>
<p>wards and inwards], between zist and zest; but while
</p>
<p>he is determining, I am for zist, that is to say, I 'm
</p>
<p>Cardinalist. I 've been regularly doing business for my
</p>
<p>Lord since the first job he gave me, three years ago.
</p>
<p>I '11 tell thee about it. He wanted some men of firm-
</p>
<p>ness and spirit for a little expedition, and sent for me
</p>
<p>to be judge-advocate."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! a very pretty post, I 've heard."
</p>
<p>" Yes, 't is a trade like ours, where they sell cord in-
</p>
<p>stead of thread ; but it is less honest, for they kill men
</p>
<p>oftener. But 't is also more profitable ; everything has
</p>
<p>its price."
</p>
<p>" Very properly so," said Jacques.
</p>
<p>" Behold me, then, in a red robe. I helped to give a
</p>
<p>yellow one and brimstone to a fine fellow, who was cure
</p>
<p>at Loudun, and who had got into a convent of nuns, like
</p>
<p>a wolf in a fold ; and a fine thing he made of it."
</p>
<p>" Ha, ha, ha ! that 's very droll ! " laughed Jacques.
</p>
<p>" Drink," said Houmain. " Yes, Jago, I saw him
</p>
<p>after the affair, reduced to a little black heap like this
</p>
<p>charcoal. See, this charcoal at the end of my poniard.
</p>
<p>What things we are ! That 's just what we shall all
</p>
<p>come to when we go to the Devil."

</p>

</p>
<p>" Well, I don't say no ; it may be so," said Houmain,
</p>
<p>in the same tone. " There 's Richelieu a cardinal ! But
</p>
<p>no matter. Thou must know, then, as I was advocate-
</p>
<p>general, I advocated "
</p>
<p>" Ah, thou art quite a wit ! "
</p>
<p>" Yes, a little. But as I was saying, I advocated
</p>
<p>into my own pocket five hundred piastres, for Armand
</p>
<p>Duplessis pays his people well, and there's nothing to
</p>
<p>be said against that, except that the money's not his
</p>
<p>own ; but that 's the way with us all. I determined to
</p>
<p>invest this money in our old trade ; and I returned here.
</p>
<p>Business goes on well. There is sentence of death out
</p>
<p>against us ; and our goods, of course, sell for half as
</p>
<p>much again as before."
</p>
<p>" What 's that ? " exclaimed Jacques ; " lightning at
</p>
<p>this time of year ? "
</p>
<p>" Yes, the storms are beginning ; we 've had two
</p>
<p>already. We are in the clouds. Dost hear the roll of
</p>
<p>the thunder ? But this is nothing ; come, drink. 'T is
</p>
<p>almost one in the morning ; we '11 finish the skin and
</p>
<p>the night together. As I was telling thee, I made ac-
</p>
<p>quaintance with our president, a great scoundrel called
</p>
<p>Laubardemont. Dost know him ? "
</p>
<p>" Yes, a little," said Jacques ; " he 's a regular miser.
</p>
<p>But never mind that ; go on."
</p>
<p>" Well, as we had nothing to conceal from one an-
</p>
<p>other, I told him of my little commercial plans, and
</p>
<p>asked him, when any good jobs presented themselves, to
</p>
<p>think of his judicial comrade ; and I 've had no cause to
</p>
<p>complain of him."

<p>" Ah ! " said Jacques, " and what has he done ? "
</p>
<p>160 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" Why, first, two years ago, he himself brought me,
</p>
<p>on horseback behind him, his niece that thou'st seen
</p>
<p>out there."
</p>
<p>" His niece ! " cried Jacques, rising ; " and thou
</p>
<p>treat' st her like a slave ! Demonio ! "
</p>
<p>"Drink," said Houmain, quietly stirring the brazier
</p>
<p>with his poniard ; " he himself desired it should be so.
</p>
<p>Sit down."
</p>
<p>Jacques did so.
</p>
<p>" I don't think," continued the smuggler, " that he 'd
</p>
<p>even be sorry to know she was dost understand ?
</p>
<p>to hear she was under the snow rather than above it ;
</p>
<p>but he would not put her there himself, because he 's a
</p>
<p>good relative, as he himself said."
</p>
<p>" And as I know," said Jacques ; " but go on."
</p>
<p>"Thou mayst suppose that a man like him, who lives
</p>
<p>at court, does not like to have a mad niece in his house.
</p>
<p>The thing is self-evident ; if I 'd continued to play my
</p>
<p>part of man of the robe, I should have done the same in
</p>
<p>a similar case. But here, as you perceive, we don't care
</p>
<p>much for appearances ; and I 've taken her for a servant.
</p>
<p>She has shown more good sense than I expected, al-
</p>
<p>though she has rarely ever spoken more than a single
</p>
<p>word, and at first came the delicate over us. Now she
</p>
<p>rubs down a mule like a groom. She has had a slight
</p>
<p>fever for the last few days ; but 't will pass off one way
</p>
<p>or the other. But I say, don't tell Laubardemont that
</p>
<p>she still lives; he 'd think 'twas for the sake of economy
</p>
<p>I 've kept her for a servant."

<p>second transaction I 've had with this Laubardemont,
</p>
<p>or demon, or whatever the name is; but 'tis a good
</p>
<p>devil of a demon, at all events. I love him as I do my
</p>
<p>eyes ; and I will drink his health out of this bottle of
</p>
<p>JuranQon here. 'T is the wine of a jolly fellow, the late
</p>
<p>King Henri. How happy we are here ! Spain on the
</p>
<p>right hand, France on the left ; the wine-skin on one
</p>
<p>side, the bottle on the other ! The bottle ! I 've left all
</p>
<p>for the bottle ! "
</p>
<p>As he spoke, he knocked off the neck of a bottle of
</p>
<p>white wine. After taking a long draught, he continued,
</p>
<p>while the stranger closely watched him,
</p>
<p>" Yes, he 's here ; and his feet must be rather
</p>
<p>cold, for he 's been waiting about the mountains ever
</p>
<p>since sunset, with his guards and our comrades. Thou
</p>
<p>knowest our bandoleros, the true contrabandistas ? "
</p>
<p>" Ah ! and what do they hunt ? " said Jacques.
</p>
<p>" Ah, that 's the joke ! " answered the drunkard.
</p>
<p>" 'T is to arrest two rascals, who want to bring here
</p>
<p>sixty thousand Spanish soldiers in paper in their pocket.
</p>
<p>You don't, perhaps, quite understand me, croquant.
</p>
<p>Well, 'tis as I tell thee, in their own pockets."
</p>
<p>" Ay, ay ! I understand," said Jacques, loosening his
</p>
<p>poniard in his sash, and looking at the door.
</p>
<p>"Very well, devil's-skin, let's sing the Tirana. Take
</p>
<p>the bottle, throw away the cigar, and sing."
</p>
<p>With these words the drunken host began to sing in
</p>
<p>Spanish, interrupting his song with bumpers, which he
</p>
<p>threw down his throat, leaning back for the greater

<p>ease, while Jacques, still seated, looked at him gloom-
</p>
<p>ily by the light of the brazier, and meditated what he
</p>
<p>should do.
</p>
<p>" Yo que soi contrabandista
</p>
<p>I campo por mi respeto,
</p>
<p>A todos los desafio,
</p>
<p>Puis a nadie tengo miedo.
</p>
<p>" Ay ! jaleo ! Muchachas
</p>
<p>Quien me merca un hilo negro ? " 1
</p>
<p>A flash of lightning entered .the small window, and
</p>
<p>filled the room with a sulphurous odor. A fearful clap
</p>
<p>immediately followed ; the cabin shook ; and a beam fell
</p>
<p>outside.
</p>
<p>" Hallo, the house ! " cried the drunken man ; " the
</p>
<p>Devil 's among us ; and our friends are not come ! "
</p>
<p>" Sing ! " said Jacques, drawing the pack upon which
</p>
<p>he was close to that of Houmain.
</p>
<p>The latter drank to encourage himself, and then
</p>
<p>continued,
</p>
<p>" Mi caballo esta cansado,
</p>
<p>Y yo me marcho corriendo.
</p>
<p>" Ay ! ay ! que viene la ronda,

<p>THE STORM. 163
</p>
<p>As he ended, he felt his seat totter, and fell back-
</p>
<p>wards ; Jacques, thus freed from him, sprang towards
</p>
<p>the door, when it opened, and his head struck against
</p>
<p>the cold, pale face of the mad-woman. He recoiled.
</p>
<p>" The judge ! " she said, as she entered ; and she fell
</p>
<p>prostrate on the cold ground.
</p>
<p>Jacques had already passed one foot over her ; but
</p>
<p>another face appeared, livid and surprised, that of a
</p>
<p>very tall man, enveloped in a cloak covered with snow..
</p>
<p>He again recoiled, and laughed a laugh of terror and
</p>
<p>rage. It was Laubardemont, followed by armed men ;
</p>
<p>they looked at one another.
</p>
<p>" Ah, com-r-a-d-e, yo-u raa-scal ! " hiccuped Houmain,
</p>
<p>rising with difficulty ; " thou 'rt a Royalist."
</p>
<p>But when he saw these two men, who seemed petri-
</p>
<p>fied by each other, he became silent, as conscious of his
</p>
<p>intoxication ; and he reeled forward to raise up the mad-
</p>
<p>woman, who was still lying between the judge and the
</p>
<p>captain. The former spoke first.
</p>
<p>" Are you not he we have been pursuing?"
</p>
<p>" It is he ! " said the armed men, with one voice ; " the
</p>
<p>other has escaped."
</p>
<p>Jacques receded to the split planks that formed the
</p>
<p>tottering wall of the hut ; enveloping himself in his
</p>
<p>cloak, like a bear forced against a tree by the hounds,
</p>
<p>and wishing to gain a moment's respite for reflection,
</p>
<p>lie said firmly,
</p>
<p>" The first who passes that brazier and the body of
</p>
<p>that girl is a dead man."
</p>
<p>And he drew a long poniard from his cloak. At this

</p>
<p>moment Houmain, kneeling, turned the head of the girl.
</p>
<p>164 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>Her eyes were closed ; he drew her towards the brazier,
</p>
<p>which lighted up her face.
</p>
<p>"Ah, heavens ! " cried Laubardemont, forgetting him-
</p>
<p>self in his fright ; " Jeanne again ! "
</p>
<p>" Be calm, my lo-lord," said Houmain, trying to open
</p>
<p>the eyelids, which closed again, and to raise her head,
</p>
<p>which fell back again like wet linen ; " be, be-calm !
</p>
<p>Do-n't ex-cite yourself; she's dead, de-ci-dedly."
</p>
<p>Jacques put his foot on the body as on a barrier,
</p>
<p>and looking with a ferocious laugh in the face of Lau-
</p>
<p>bardemont, said to him in a low voice,
</p>
<p>" Let me pass, and I will not compromise thee, cour-
</p>
<p>tier ; I will not tell that she was thy niece, and that I
</p>
<p>am thy son."
</p>
<p>Laubardemont collected himself, looked at his men,
</p>
<p>who pressed around him with advanced carabines ; and
</p>
<p>signing them to retire a few steps, he answered in a
</p>
<p>very low voice,
</p>
<p>" Give me the treaty, and thou shalt pass."
</p>
<p>" Here it is, in my girdle ; touch it, and I will call you
</p>
<p>my father aloud. What will thy master say ? "
</p>
<p>" Give it me, and I will pardon thy life."
</p>
<p>" Let me pass, and I will pardon thy having given me
</p>
<p>that life."
</p>
<p>" Still the same, brigand ? "
</p>
<p>" Ay, assassin."
</p>
<p>" What matters to thee that boy conspirator ? " asked
</p>
<p>the judge.
</p>
<p>" What matters to thee that old man who reigns ? "
</p>
<p>answered the other.

<p>" Give me that paper ; I 've sworn to have it."
</p>
<p>THE STORM. 165
</p>
<p>" Leave it with me ; I 've sworn to carry it back."
</p>
<p>" What can be thy oath and thy God ? " demanded
</p>
<p>Laubardemont.
</p>
<p>" And thine ? " replied Jacques. " Is 't the crucifix of
</p>
<p>red-hot iron ? "
</p>
<p>Here Houmain, rising between them, laughing and
</p>
<p>staggering, said to the judge, slapping him on the
</p>
<p>shoulder,
</p>
<p>" You are a long time coming to an understanding,
</p>
<p>friend ; do-on't you know him of old ? He 's a very good
</p>
<p>fellow."
</p>
<p>" I ? no ! " cried Laubardemont, aloud ; " I never saw
</p>
<p>him before."
</p>
<p>At this moment, Jacques, who was protected by the
</p>
<p>drunkard and the smallness of the crowded chamber,
</p>
<p>sprang violently against the weak planks that formed
</p>
<p>the wall, and by a blow of his heel knocked two of them
</p>
<p>out, and passed through the space thus created. The
</p>
<p>whole side of the cabin was broken ; it tottered, and the
</p>
<p>wind rushed in.
</p>
<p>" Hallo ! Demonio .' Santo Demonio ! where art
</p>
<p>going?" cried the smuggler; " thou art breaking my
</p>
<p>house down, and on the side of the ravine too."
</p>
<p>All cautiously approached, tore away the planks that
</p>
<p>remained, and leaned over the abyss. They contem-
</p>
<p>plated a strange spectacle. The storm raged in all its
</p>
<p>fury ; and it was a storm of the Pyrenees. Enormous
</p>
<p>flashes of lightning came all at once from all parts of
</p>
<p>the horizon, and their fires succeeded so quickly that
</p>
<p>there seemed no interval ; they appeared to be a contin-

<p>uous flash. 'T was but rarelv the flaming; vault would

</p>
<p>suddenly become obscure ; and it then instantly resumed
</p>
<p>its glare. It was not the light that seemed strange on
</p>
<p>this night, but the darkness. The tall thin peaks and
</p>
<p>whitened rocks stood out from the red background like
</p>
<p>blocks of marble on a cupola of burning brass, and re-
</p>
<p>sembled, amid the snows, the wonders of a volcano ; the
</p>
<p>waters gushed from them like flames ; the snow poured
</p>
<p>down like dazzling lava.
</p>
<p>In this moving mass a man was seen struggling,
</p>
<p>whose efforts only involved him deeper and deeper in
</p>
<p>the whirling and liquid gulf ; his knees were already
</p>
<p>buried. In vain he clasped his arms round an enormous
</p>
<p>pyramidal and transparent icicle, which reflected the
</p>
<p>lightning like a rock of crystal ; the icicle itself was
</p>
<p>melting at its base, and slowly bending over the de-
</p>
<p>clivity of the rock. Under the covering of snow, masses
</p>
<p>of granite were heard striking against each other, as
</p>
<p>they descended into the vast depths below. Yet they
</p>
<p>could still save him ; a space of scarcely four feet sepa-
</p>
<p>rated him from Laubardemont.
</p>
<p>" I sink ! " he cried ; " hold out to me something, and
</p>
<p>thou shalt have the treaty."
</p>
<p>" Give it me, and I will reach thee this musket," said
</p>
<p>the judge.
</p>
<p>" There it is," replied the ruffian, " since the Devil is
</p>
<p>for Richelieu ! " and taking one hand from the hold of
</p>
<p>his slippery support, he threw a roll of wood into the
</p>
<p>cabin. Laubardemont rushed back upon the treaty like
</p>
<p>a wolf on his prey. Jacques in vain held out his arm;
</p>
<p>he slowly glided away with the enormous thawing block

<p>turned upon him, and was silently buried in the snow.
</p>
<p>THE STORM. 167
</p>
<p>" Ah, villain," were his last words, " thou hast de-
</p>
<p>ceived me ! but thou didst not take the treaty from me.
</p>
<p>I gave it thee, Father I " and he disappeared wholly
</p>
<p>under the thick white bed of snow. Nothing was seen in
</p>
<p>his place but the glittering flakes which the lightning
</p>
<p>had ploughed up, as it became extinguished in them ;
</p>
<p>nothing was heard but the rolling of the thunder and the
</p>
<p>dash of the waters against the rocks, for the men in the
</p>
<p>half-ruined cabin, grouped round a corpse and a villain,
</p>
<p>were silent, tongue-tied with horror, and fearing lest
</p>
<p>God himself should send a thunderbolt upon them. 1
</p>
<p>1 He lived and died with brigands. Was there not a divine punishment
</p>
<p>on the family of this judge, to expiate, in some measure, the cruel and
</p>
<p>pitiless death of poor Grandier, whose blood cries aloud for vengeance ?

</p>
<p>ABSENCE.
</p>
<p>L'absence est le plus grand des maux,
</p>
<p>Non pas pour vous, cruelle !
</p>
<p>LA FONTAINE.
</p>
<p>WHO has not found a charm in watching the clouds of
</p>
<p>heaven as they pass on ? Who has not envied them the
</p>
<p>freedom of their journeyings through the air, whether
</p>
<p>rolled in great masses by the wind, and colored by the
</p>
<p>sun, they advance peacefully, like fleets of dark ships
</p>
<p>with gilt prows, or sprinkled in light groups, they glide
</p>
<p>quickly on, airy and elongated, like birds of passage,
</p>
<p>transparent as vast opals detached from the treasury of
</p>
<p>the heavens, or glittering with whiteness, like snows
</p>
<p>from the mountains carried on the wings of the winds ?
</p>
<p>Man is a slow traveller who envies those rapid journey-
</p>
<p>ers ; though less rapid than his imagination, they have
</p>
<p>yet seen in a single day all the places he loves, in re-
</p>
<p>membrance or in hope, those that have witnessed his
</p>
<p>happiness or his misery, and those so beautiful countries

<p>unknown to us, where we expect to find everything at
</p>
<p>ABSENCE. 169
</p>
<p>once. Doubtless there is not a spot on the whole earth,
</p>
<p>a wild rock, an arid plain, over which we pass with in-
</p>
<p>difference, that has not been consecrated in the life of
</p>
<p>some man, and is not painted in his remembrance ; for
</p>
<p>like battered vessels, before meeting inevitable wreck, we
</p>
<p>leave some fragment of ourselves on every rock.
</p>
<p>Whither go the dark-blue clouds of that storm of the
</p>
<p>Pyrenees ? ' T is the wind of Africa which drives them
</p>
<p>before it with a fiery breath. They fly ; they roll over
</p>
<p>one another, growlingly throwing out lightning before
</p>
<p>them, as their torches, and leaving suspended behind
</p>
<p>them a long train of rain, like a vaporous robe. Freed
</p>
<p>by an effort from the rocky defiles that for a moment
</p>
<p>had arrested their course, they irrigate, in Be"aru, the
</p>
<p>picturesque patrimony of Henri IV. ; in Guyenne, the
</p>
<p>conquests of Charles VII. ; in Saintonge, Poitou, and
</p>
<p>Touraine, those of Charles V. and of Philip Augustus ;
</p>
<p>and at last, slackening their pace above the old domain
</p>
<p>of Hugh Capet, stop murmuring on the towers of St.
</p>
<p>Germain.
</p>
<p>" Oli, Madame ! " exclaimed Marie de Mantua to the
</p>
<p>queen, " do you see this storm coming up from the
</p>
<p>south ? "
</p>
<p>" You often look in that direction, ma chere" answered
</p>
<p>Anne of Austria, leaning on the balcony.
</p>
<p>" It is the direction of the sun, Madame."
</p>
<p>" And of tempests, you see," said the queen. " Trust
</p>
<p>in my friendship, my child ; these clouds can bring no
</p>
<p>happiness to you. 1 would rather see you turn your
</p>
<p>eyes towards Poland. See the fine people you might

<p>command."
</p>
<p>170 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>At this moment, to avoid the rain, which began to fall,
</p>
<p>the prince palatine passed rapidly under the windows of
</p>
<p>the queen, with a numerous suite of young Poles on
</p>
<p>horseback. Their Turkish vests, with buttons of dia-
</p>
<p>monds, emeralds, and rubies ; their green and gray
</p>
<p>cloaks ; the lofty plumes of their horses, and their ad-
</p>
<p>venturous air, gave them a singular eclat to which the
</p>
<p>court had easily become accustomed. They paused for
</p>
<p>a moment, and the prince made two salutes, while the
</p>
<p>light animal he rode passed gracefully sideways, keeping
</p>
<p>his front towards the princesses ; prancing and snorting,
</p>
<p>he shook his mane, and seemed to salute by putting his
</p>
<p>head between his legs. The whole suite repeated the
</p>
<p>evolution as they passed. The Princesse Marie had at
</p>
<p>first shrunk back lest they should see her tears ; but the
</p>
<p>brilliant and "flattering spectacle made her return to the
</p>
<p>balcony, and she could not help exclaiming,
</p>
<p>" How gracefully the palatine rides that beautiful
</p>
<p>horse ! he seems scarce conscious of it."
</p>
<p>The queen smiled and said,
</p>
<p>" He is conscious about her who might be his queen
</p>
<p>to-morrow, if she would but make a sign of the head, and
</p>
<p>let but one glance from her great black almond-shaped
</p>
<p>eyes be turned on that throne, instead of always receiv-
</p>
<p>ing these poor foreigners with poutings as now."
</p>
<p>And Anne of Austria kissed the cheek of Marie, who
</p>
<p>could not refrain from smiling also ; but she instantly
</p>
<p>sunk her head, reproaching herself, and resumed her
</p>
<p>sadness, which seemed gliding from her. She even
</p>
<p>needed once more to contemplate the great clouds that

<p>hung over the chateau.
</p>
<p>ABSENCE. 171
</p>
<p>" Poor child," continued the queen, " thou dost all
</p>
<p>thou canst to be very faithful, and to keep thyself in the
</p>
<p>melancholy of thy romance. Thou art making thyself
</p>
<p>ill with weeping when thou shouldst be asleep, and with
</p>
<p>not eating. Thou passest the night in revery and in
</p>
<p>writing ; but I warn thee, thou wilt get nothing by it,
</p>
<p>except making thyself thin and less beautiful, and the
</p>
<p>not being a queen. Thy Cinq-Mars is an ambitious
</p>
<p>youth, who has lost himself."
</p>
<p>Seeing Marie conceal her head in her handkerchief to
</p>
<p>weep, Anne of Austria for a moment re-entered her
</p>
<p>chamber, leaving Marie in the balcony, and feigned to be
</p>
<p>looking for some jewels at her toilet-table ; she soon
</p>
<p>returned, slowly and gravely, to the window. Marie was
</p>
<p>more calm, and was gazing sorrowfully at the landscape
</p>
<p>before her, the hills in the distance, and the storm
</p>
<p>gradually spreading itself.
</p>
<p>The queen resumed in a more serious tone,
</p>
<p>" God has been more good to you than your impru-
</p>
<p>dence perhaps deserved, Marie. He has saved you from
</p>
<p>great danger. You were willing to make great sacrifices,
</p>
<p>but fortunately they have not been accomplished as you
</p>
<p>expected. Innocence has saved you from love. You
</p>
<p>are as one who, thinking she was swallowing a deadly
</p>
<p>poison, has in reality drunk only pure and harmless
</p>
<p>water."
</p>
<p>" Ah, Madame, what mean you ? Am I not unhappy
</p>
<p>enough already ? "
</p>
<p>" Do not interrupt me," said the queen ; " you will, ere
</p>
<p>long, see your present position with different eyes. I

</p>
<p>I have too many reasons for not liking him. I myself
</p>
<p>witnessed the rise of the conspiracy. Still you should
</p>
<p>remember, ma chere, that he was the only person in
</p>
<p>France who, against the opinion of the queen-mother
</p>
<p>and of the court, insisted upon war with the duchy of
</p>
<p>Mantua, which he recovered from the empire and from
</p>
<p>Spain, and returned to the Due de Nevers, your father.
</p>
<p>Here, in this very chateau of St. Germain, was signed
</p>
<p>the treaty which deposed the Duke of Guastalla. 1 You
</p>
<p>were then very young ; they must, however, have told
</p>
<p>you of it. Yet here, through love alone (I am willing
</p>
<p>to believe, with yourself, that it is so) a young man of
</p>
<p>two-and-twenty is ready to get him assassinated."

<p>" Oh, Madame, he is incapable of such a deed. I swear

<p>to you that he has refused to adopt it."
</p>
<p>" I have begged you, Marie, to let me speak. I know
</p>
<p>that he is generous and loyal. I am willing to believe
</p>
<p>that contrary to the custom of our times, he would not
</p>
<p>go so far as to kill an old man, as did the Chevalier de
</p>
<p>Guise. But can he prevent his assassination, if his
</p>
<p>troops make him prisoner ? This we cannot say, any
</p>
<p>more than he. God alone knows the future. It is, at
</p>
<p>all events, certain that it is for you he attacks him,
</p>
<p>and, to overthrow him, is preparing civil war, which
</p>
<p>perhaps is bursting forth at the very moment that we
</p>
<p>speak, a war without success. Whichever way it turns,
</p>
<p>it can only effect evil, for Monsieur is going to abandon
</p>
<p>the conspiracy."
</p>
<p>" How, Madame ? "

<p>not explain myself farther. What will the grand e*cuyer
</p>
<p>do ? The king, as he rightly anticipated, has gone to
</p>
<p>consult the cardinal. To consult him is to yield to him ;
</p>
<p>but the treaty of Spain is signed. If it be discovered,
</p>
<p>what can M. de Cinq-Mars do ? Do not tremble thus.
</p>
<p>"We will save him ; we will save his life, I promise you.
</p>
<p>There is yet time, I hope."
</p>
<p>" Ah, Madame, you hope ! I am lost ! " cried Marie,
</p>
<p>half fainting.
</p>
<p>" Let us sit down," said the queen ; and placing her-
</p>
<p>self near Marie, at the entrance to the chamber, she
</p>
<p>continued,
</p>
<p>" Doubtless Monsieur will treat for all the con-
</p>
<p>spirators in treating for himself ; but exile will be the
</p>
<p>least punishment, perpetual exile. Behold, then, the
</p>
<p>Duchesse de Nevers and Mantua, the Princesse Marie
</p>
<p>de Gonzaga, the wife of M. Henri d'Effiat, Marquis de
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars, exiled ! "
</p>
<p>" Well, Madame, I will follow him into exile. It is
</p>
<p>my duty ; I am his wife ! " exclaimed Marie, sobbing.
</p>
<p>" I would I knew he were already banished and in
</p>
<p>safety."
</p>
<p>" Dreams of eighteen ! " said the queen, supporting
</p>
<p>Marie. " Awake, child, awake ! you must. I deny not
</p>
<p>the good qualities of M. de Cinq-Mars. He has a lofty
</p>
<p>character, a vast mind, and great courage ; but he may
</p>
<p>no longer be aught for you, and fortunately you are not
</p>
<p>his wife, or even his betrothed."
</p>
<p>" I am his, Madame, his alone."
</p>
<p>" But without the benediction," replied Anne of Aus-

</p>
<p>174 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>have dared, not even your own ; he told me so. Be
</p>
<p>silent ! " she added, putting her two beautiful hands on
</p>
<p>Marie's lips. " Be silent ! You would say that God
</p>
<p>heard your vow ; that you cannot live without him ;
</p>
<p>that your destinies are inseparable from his ; that death
</p>
<p>alone can break your union ? The phrases of your age,
</p>
<p>delicious chimeras of a moment, at which one day you
</p>
<p>will smile, happy at not having to lament them all your
</p>
<p>life. Of the many and brilliant women you see around
</p>
<p>me at court, there is not one but at your age had some
</p>
<p>beautiful dream of love, like this of yours, who did not
</p>
<p>form those ties, which they believed indissoluble, and
</p>
<p>who did not in secret take eternal oaths. Well, these
</p>
<p>dreams are vanished, these knots broken, these oaths
</p>
<p>forgotten ; and yet you see them happy women and
</p>
<p>mothers. Surrounded by the-honors of their rank, they
</p>
<p>laugh and dance every night. I again divine what you
</p>
<p>would say ; they loved not as you love, eh ? You de-
</p>
<p>ceive yourself, my dear child ; they loved as much, and
</p>
<p>wept no less. And here I must make you acquainted
</p>
<p>with that great mystery which constitutes your despair,
</p>
<p>because you are ignorant of the malady that devours
</p>
<p>you. We have a twofold existence, mon amie : our
</p>
<p>internal life, that of our feelings, powerfully works
</p>
<p>within us, while the external life dominates despite
</p>
<p>ourselves. We are never independent of men, more
</p>
<p>especially in an elevated condition. Alone, we think
</p>
<p>ourselves mistresses of our destiny; but the entrance
</p>
<p>of two or three people fastens on all our chains, by
</p>
<p>recalling our rank and our retinue. Nay ; shut yourself

</p>
<p>nary resolutions that the passions may raise up in you,
</p>
<p>to the marvellous sacrifices they may suggest to you. A
</p>
<p>lackey coming and asking your orders will at once
</p>
<p>break the charm and bring you back to your real life.
</p>
<p>It is this contest between your projects and your posi-
</p>
<p>tion which destroys you. You are invariably angry with
</p>
<p>yourself ; you bitterly reproach yourself."
</p>
<p>Marie turned away her head.
</p>
<p>" Yes, you believe yourself criminal. Pardon your-
</p>
<p>self, Marie ; all men are beings so relative and so de-
</p>
<p>pendent one upon another that I know not whether the
</p>
<p>great retreats of the world that we sometimes see are
</p>
<p>not made for the world itself. Despair has its pursuits,
</p>
<p>and solitude its coquetry. It is said that the gloomiest
</p>
<p>hermits cannot refrain from inquiring what men say of
</p>
<p>them. This need of public opinion is beneficial, in that
</p>
<p>it combats, almost always victoriously, that which is
</p>
<p>irregular in our imagination, and comes to the aid of
</p>
<p>duties which we too easily forget. One experiences
</p>
<p>(you will feel it, I hope) in returning to one's proper
</p>
<p>lot, after the sacrifice of that which had diverted the
</p>
<p>reason, the satisfaction of an exile returning to his
</p>
<p>family, of a sick person at sight of the sun after a night
</p>
<p>afflicted with frightful dreams. It is this feeling of a
</p>
<p>being returned, as it were, to its natural state that
</p>
<p>creates the calm which you see in many eyes that have
</p>
<p>also had their tears, for there are few women who
</p>
<p>have not known tears such as yours. You would think
</p>
<p>yourself perjured if you renounced Cinq-Mars ! But

</p>
<p>years past the royal hands offered you. And after all,
</p>
<p>what has he done, this impassioned lover ? He has
</p>
<p>elevated himself to reach you ; but may not the ambi-
</p>
<p>tion which here seems to you to have aided love have
</p>
<p>made use of that love ? This young man seems to me
</p>
<p>too profound, too calm in his political stratagems, too
</p>
<p>independent in his vast resolutions, in his colossal en-
</p>
<p>terprises, for me to believe him solely occupied by his
</p>
<p>tenderness. If you have been but a means instead of
</p>
<p>an end, what would you say ? "
</p>
<p>" I would still love him," answered Marie. " While
</p>
<p>he lives, I am his."
</p>
<p>" And while I live," said the queen, with firmness, " I
</p>
<p>will oppose the alliance."
</p>
<p>At these last words the rain and hail fell violently on
</p>
<p>the balcony. The queen took advantage of the circum-
</p>
<p>stance abruptly to leave the room and pass into that
</p>
<p>where the Duchesse de Chevreuse, Mazarin, Madame de
</p>
<p>Gueme'ne', and the prince palatine had been awaiting her
</p>
<p>for a short time. The queen walked up to them. Marie
</p>
<p>placed herself in the shade of a curtain, in order to con-
</p>
<p>ceal the redness of her eyes. She was at first unwill-
</p>
<p>ing to take part in the sprightly conversation ; but some
</p>
<p>words of it attracted her attention. The queen was
</p>
<p>showing to the Princes.se de Gueme'ne' diamonds she
</p>
<p>had just received from Paris.
</p>
<p>" As for this crown, it does not belong to me. The
</p>
<p>king had it prepared for the future Queen of Poland.
</p>
<p>Who that is to be, we know not." Then turning to-
</p>
<p>wards the prince palatine, " We saw you pass, Prince.

</p>
<p>ABSENCE. 177
</p>
<p>" Mademoiselle la Duchesse de Rohan," answered the
</p>
<p>Pole.
</p>
<p>The insinuating Mazarin, who availed himself of every
</p>
<p>opportunity to worm out secrets, and to make himself
</p>
<p>necessary by forced confidences, said, approaching the
</p>
<p>queen,
</p>
<p>" That comes very d propos, just as we were speaking
</p>
<p>of the crown of Poland."
</p>
<p>Marie, who was listening, could not hear this, and
</p>
<p>said to Madame de Gueme'ne', who was at her side,
</p>
<p>" Is M. de Chabot, then, King of Poland ? "
</p>
<p>The queen heard that, and was delighted at this touch
</p>
<p>of pride. In order to develop its germ, she affected an
</p>
<p>Approving attention to the conversation that ensued.
</p>
<p>The Princesse de Gueme'ne' exclaimed,
</p>
<p>" Can you conceive such a marriage ? We really
</p>
<p>can't get it out of our heads. This same Mademoiselle
</p>
<p>de Rohan, whom we have seen so haughty, after having
</p>
<p>refused the Comte de Soissons, the Due de Weimar, and
</p>
<p>the Due de Nemours, to marry M. de Chabot, a simple
</p>
<p>gentleman ! 'T is really a sad pity ! What are we
</p>
<p>coming to ? 'T is impossible to say what it will all
</p>
<p>end in."
</p>
<p>Mazarin added, slyly,
</p>
<p>" What ! can it be true ? Love at court ! a real love !
</p>
<p>deep ! Can it be believed ? "
</p>
<p>All this time the queen continued opening and shut-
</p>
<p>ting and playing with the new crown.
</p>
<p>" Diamonds only suit black hair," she said. "Let's
</p>
<p>see. Let me put it on you, Marie. Why, it suits her
</p>
<p>to admiration ! "

</p>
<p>" I would give the last drop of my blood for it to re-

</p>
<p>Marie, through the tears that were still on her cheek,

</p>
<p>THE WORK.

<p>Peu d'esperance doivent avoir les pauvres et menues gens au fait
</p>
<p>de ce monde, puisque si grand roy y a tant souffert et tant travaille.
</p>
<p>PHILIPPE DE COMINES.
</p>
<p>ONE night, before Perpignan, a very unusual event took
</p>
<p>place. It was ten o'clock ; and all were asleep. The
</p>
<p>slow and almost suspended operations of the siege had
</p>
<p>rendered the camp and the town inactive. The Span-
</p>
<p>iards troubled themselves little about the French, all
</p>
<p>communication towards Catalonia being open as in time
</p>
<p>of peace ; and in the French army men's minds were
</p>
<p>agitated with that secret anxiety which precedes great
</p>
<p>events. Yet all was apparently calm ; no sound was
</p>
<p>heard but that of the measured tread of the sentinels.
</p>
<p>Nothing was seen in the dark night but the red light of
</p>
<p>the matches of their guns, always smoking, when sud-
</p>
<p>denly the trumpets of the musketeers, of the light-horse,
</p>
<p>and of the men-at-arms, sounded almost simultaneously,

<p>" boot and saddle," and " to horse." All the sentinels
</p>

</p>
<p>cried to arms ; and the sergeants, with flambeaux, went
</p>
<p>from tent to tent, a long pike in their hands, to waken
</p>
<p>the soldiers, range them in lines, and count them.
</p>
<p>Some files marched in gloomy silence along the streets
</p>
<p>of the camp, and took their position in battle array.
</p>
<p>The sound of the mounted squadrons announced that
</p>
<p>the heavy cavalry were making the same dispositions.
</p>
<p>After half an hour of movement the noise ceased, the
</p>
<p>torches were extinguished, and all again became calm,
</p>
<p>but the army was on foot.
</p>
<p>One of the last tents of the camp shone within as a
</p>
<p>star with flambeaux. On approaching this little white
</p>
<p>and transparent pyramid, we might have distinguished
</p>
<p>the shadows of two men reflected on the canvas as
</p>
<p>they walked to and fro within. Outside several men on
</p>
<p>horseback were in attendance ; inside were De Thou and
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>To see the pious and wise De Thou thus up and
</p>
<p>armed at this hour, you might have taken him for one
</p>
<p>of the chiefs of the revolt. But a clpser examination
</p>
<p>of his serious countenance and mournful expression
</p>
<p>immediately showed that he blamed it, and allowed
</p>
<p>himself to be led into it and endangered by it from an
</p>
<p>extraordinary resolution which aided him to surmount
</p>
<p>the horror he had of the enterprise itself. From the
</p>
<p>day when Henri d'Effiat had opened his heart and con-
</p>
<p>fided to him its whole secret, he had seen clearly that
</p>
<p>all remonstrance was vain with a young man so pow-
</p>
<p>erfully resolved. He had even understood what M. de
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars had not told him, and had seen in the secret

<p>union of his friend with the Princesse Marie one of
</p>
<p>THE WORK. 181
</p>
<p>those ties of love whose mysterious and frequent faults,
</p>
<p>voluptuous and involuntary derelictions, could not be
</p>
<p>too soon purified by public benediction. He had com-
</p>
<p>prehended that punishment, impossible to be supported
</p>
<p>long by a lover, the adored master of that young girl,
</p>
<p>and who was condemned daily to appear before her as
</p>
<p>a stranger, to receive political disclosures of marriages
</p>
<p>they were preparing for her. The day when he received
</p>
<p>his entire confession, he had done all in his power to
</p>
<p>prevent Cinq-Mars going so far in his projects as the
</p>
<p>foreign alliance. He had evoked the gravest recollec-
</p>
<p>tions and the best feelings, without any other result
</p>
<p>than rendering the invincible resolution of his friend
</p>
<p>more rude towards him. Cinq-Mars, it will be recol-
</p>
<p>lected, had said to him harshly, " Well, did I ask you
</p>
<p>to take part in this conspiracy ? " And he had desired
</p>
<p>only to promise not to denounce it ; and he had col-
</p>
<p>lected all his power against friendship to say, " Expect
</p>
<p>nothing further from me if you sign this treaty." Yet
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars had signed the treaty ; and De Thou was still
</p>
<p>there with him.
</p>
<p>The habit of familiarly discussing the projects of his
</p>
<p>friend had perhaps rendered them less odious to him.
</p>
<p>His contempt for the vices of the prime minister ; his
</p>
<p>indignation at the servitude of the parliaments to which
</p>
<p>his family belonged, and at the corruption of justice ;
</p>
<p>the powerful names, and more especially the noble
</p>
<p>characters of the men who directed the enterprise, all
</p>
<p>had contributed to soften down his first painful impres-
</p>
<p>sion. Having once promised secrecy to M. de Cinq-Mars,

</p>
<p>he considered himself as in a position to accept in detail
</p>
<p>182 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>all the secondary disclosures ; and since the fortuitous
</p>
<p>event which had compromised him with the conspirators
</p>
<p>at the house of Marion de Lorme, he considered himself
</p>
<p>united to them by honor, and engaged to an inviolable
</p>
<p>secrecy. Since that time he had seen Monsieur, the
</p>
<p>Due de Bouillon, and Fontrailles ; they had become ac-
</p>
<p>customed to speak before him without constraint, and
</p>
<p>he to hear them.
</p>
<p>The dangers which threatened his friend now drew
</p>
<p>him into their vortex like an invincible magnet. His
</p>
<p>conscience accused him ; but he followed Cinq-Mars
</p>
<p>wherever he went without even, from excess of delicacy,
</p>
<p>hazarding a single expression which might resemble a
</p>
<p>personal fear. He had tacitly given up his life, and
</p>
<p>would have deemed it unworthy of both to manifest a
</p>
<p>desire to regain it.
</p>
<p>The master of the horse was in his cuirass ; he was
</p>
<p>armed, and wore large boots. An enormous pistol, with
</p>
<p>a lighted match, was placed upon his table between two
</p>
<p>flambeaux. A heavy watch in a brass case lay near the
</p>
<p>pistol. De Thou, wrapped in a black cloak, sat motion-
</p>
<p>less with folded arms. Cinq-Mars paced backwards and
</p>
<p>forwards, his arms crossed behind his back, from time to
</p>
<p>time looking at the hand of the watch, too sluggish in
</p>
<p>his eyes. He opened the tent, looked up to the heavens,
</p>
<p>and returned.
</p>
<p>" I do not see my star there," said he ; " but no
</p>
<p>matter. She is here in my heart."
</p>
<p>" The night is dark," said De Thou.
</p>
<p>" Say rather that the time draws nigh. It advances,

</p>
<p>THE WORK. 183
</p>
<p>will be accomplished. The army only waits the report
</p>
<p>of this pistol to commence."
</p>
<p>De Thou held in his hand an ivory crucifix, and
</p>
<p>looking first at the cross, and then towards heaven,
</p>
<p>" Now," said he, " is the hour to complete the sacrifice.
</p>
<p>I repent not ; but oh, how bitter is the cup of sin to my
</p>
<p>lips ! I had vowed my days to innocence and to the
</p>
<p>works of the soul, and here I am about to commit a
</p>
<p>crime, and to draw the sword."
</p>
<p>But forcibly seizing the hand of Cinq-Mars, " It is
</p>
<p>for you, for you ! " he added with the enthusiasm of a
</p>
<p>blindly devoted heart. " I rejoice in my errors if they
</p>
<p>turn to your glory. I see but your happiness in my
</p>
<p>fault. Forgive me if I have returned for a moment to
</p>
<p>the habitual thought of my whole life."
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars looked steadfastly at him ; and a tear stole
</p>
<p>slowly down his cheek.
</p>
<p>" Virtuous friend," said he, " may your fault fall only
</p>
<p>on my head ! But let us hope that God, who pardons
</p>
<p>those who love, will be for us ; for we are criminal,
</p>
<p>I through love, you through friendship."
</p>
<p>Then suddenly looking at the watch, he took the long
</p>
<p>pistol in his hand, and gazed at the smoking match with
</p>
<p>a fierce air. His long hair fell over his face like the
</p>
<p>mane of a young lion.
</p>
<p>" Do not consume," said he ; " burn slowly. Thou
</p>
<p>art about to light a flame which the waves of ocean
</p>
<p>cannot extinguish. The flame will soon light half Eu-
</p>
<p>rope ; it may perhaps reach the wood of thrones. Burn

<p>thyself ! Thy explosion will be heard afar, and will
</p>
<p>find echoes in the peasant's hut and the king's palace.
</p>
<p>Burn, burn, poor flame ! Thou art to me a sceptre and
</p>
<p>a thunderbolt ! "
</p>
<p>De Thou, still holding his ivory crucifix in his hand,
</p>
<p>said in a low voice,
</p>
<p>" Lord, pardon us the blood that will be shed ! We
</p>
<p>combat the wicked and the impious." Then, raising his
</p>
<p>voice, " My friend, the cause of virtue will triumph," he
</p>
<p>said; "it alone will triumph. God has ordained that
</p>
<p>the guilty treaty should not reach us ; that which con-
</p>
<p>stituted the crime is no doubt destroyed. We shall
</p>
<p>light without the foreigners, and perhaps we shall
</p>
<p>not fight at all. God will change the heart of the
</p>
<p>king."
</p>
<p>" 'T is the hour ! 't is the hour ! " exclaimed Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars, his eyes fixed upon the watch with a kind of
</p>
<p>savage joy ; " four minutes more, and the Cardinalists
</p>
<p>in the camp will be crushed ! We shall march upon
</p>
<p>Narbonne ! He is there ! Give me the pistol ! "
</p>
<p>At these words he hastily opened the tent, and took
</p>
<p>up the match.
</p>
<p>" A courier from Paris ! an express from court ! "
</p>
<p>cried a voice outside, as a man, heated with hard rid-
</p>
<p>ing and overcome with fatigue, threw himself from his
</p>
<p>horse, entered, and presented a letter to Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>" From the queen, Monseigneur," he said. Cinq-Mars
</p>
<p>turned pale, and read as follows :
</p>
<p>M. DE CINQ-MARS, I write this letter to entreat and

</p>
<p>your affection alone turns from the throne of Poland, which
</p>
<p>has been offered to her. 1 have sounded her heart. She is
</p>
<p>very young, and I have good reason to believe that she
</p>
<p>would accept the crown with less effort and less grief than
</p>
<p>you may perhaps imagine.
</p>
<p>It is for her you have undertaken a war which will put
</p>
<p>to fire and sword my beautiful and beloved France. I sup-
</p>
<p>plicate and implore you to act as a gentleman, and nobly to
</p>
<p>release the Duchesse de Mantua from the promises she may
</p>
<p>have made you. Thus restore repose to her soul, and peace
</p>
<p>to our beloved country.
</p>
<p>The queen, who will throw herself at your feet if need be,
</p>
<p>ANNE.
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars calmly replaced the pistol upon the table ;
</p>
<p>his first impulse had been to turn its muzzle upon
</p>
<p>himself. However, he laid it down, and snatching a
</p>
<p>pencil, wrote on the back of the letter:
</p>
<p>MADAME, Marie de Gonzaga, being my wife, cannot be
</p>
<p>Queen of Poland until after my death ; I die.
</p>
<p>CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>Then, as if he would not allow himself time for a
</p>
<p>moment's reflection, he forced the letter into the hands
</p>
<p>of the courier.
</p>
<p>" To horse ! to horse ! " cried he, in a furious tone.
</p>
<p>"If you remain another instant, you are a dead
</p>
<p>man ! "
</p>
<p>He saw him gallop off, and re-entered the tent.
</p>
<p>Alone with his friend, he remained an instant stand-
</p>
<p>ing, but pale, his eyes fixed, and looking on the ground
</p>
<p>like a madman. He felt himself totter.

<p>" De Thou ! " he cried.
</p>
<p>186 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" What would you, my friend, my dear friend ? I
</p>
<p>am with you. You have acted grandly, most grandly,
</p>
<p>sublimely ! "
</p>
<p>" De Thou ! " he cried again in a hollow voice, and
</p>
<p>fell with his face to the ground like an uprooted tree.
</p>
<p>Violent tempests assume different aspects, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to the climates in which they take place. Those
</p>
<p>which have spread over a terrible space in northern
</p>
<p>countries assemble into one single cloud under the
</p>
<p>torrid zone, the more formidable, that they leave the
</p>
<p>horizon in all its purity, and that the furious waves still
</p>
<p>reflect the azure of heaven while tinged with the blood
</p>
<p>of man. It is the same with great passions. They
</p>
<p>assume strange aspects according to our characters;
</p>
<p>but how terrible are they in vigorous hearts, which have
</p>
<p>preserved their force under the veil of social forms ?
</p>
<p>When youth and despair embrace, we know not to what
</p>
<p>fury they may rise, or what may be their sudden resig-
</p>
<p>nation ; we know not whether the volcano will burst
</p>
<p>the mountain or become suddenly extinguished within
</p>
<p>its entrails.
</p>
<p>De Thou, in alarm, raised his friend. The blood
</p>
<p>gushed from his nostrils and ears ; he would have
</p>
<p>thought him dead, but for the torrents o'f tears which
</p>
<p>flowed from his eyes. They were the only sign of life.
</p>
<p>Suddenly he opened his lids, looked around him, and
</p>
<p>by an extraordinary energy resumed his senses and the
</p>
<p>power of his will.
</p>
<p>" I am in the presence of men," said he ; "I must
</p>
<p>finish with them. My friend, it is half-past eleven ; the

<p>hour for the signal has passed. Give, in my name, the
</p>
<p>THE WORK. 187
</p>
<p>order to return to quarters. It was a false alarm, which
</p>
<p>1 will myself explain this evening."
</p>
<p>De Thou had already perceived the importance of
</p>
<p>this order ; he went out and returned immediately.
</p>
<p>He found Cinq-Mars seated, calm, and endeavoring to
</p>
<p>cleanse the blood from his face.
</p>
<p>" De Thou," said he, looking fixedly at him, " retire ;
</p>
<p>you disturb me."
</p>
<p>" I leave you not," answered the latter.
</p>
<p>" Fly, I tell you ! the Pyrenees are not far distant. I
</p>
<p>cannot speak much longer, even to you ; but if you
</p>
<p>remain with me, you will die. I give you warning."
</p>
<p>" I remain," repeated De Thou.
</p>
<p>" May God preserve you, then ! " answered Cinq-Mars,
</p>
<p>"for I can do nothing more; the moment has passed.
</p>
<p>I leave you here. Call Fontrailles and all the con-
</p>
<p>federates ; distribute these passports among them. Let
</p>
<p>them fly immediately ; tell them all has failed, but that
</p>
<p>I thank them. For you, once again I say, fly with them,
</p>
<p>I entreat you ; but whatever you do, follow me not,
</p>
<p>follow me not, for your life ! I swear to you not to
</p>
<p>do violence to myself ! "
</p>
<p>With these words, shaking his friend's hand without
</p>
<p>looking at him, he rushed from the tent.
</p>
<p>Meantime, some leagues thence another conversation
</p>
<p>was taking place. At Narbonne, in the same cabinet in
</p>
<p>which we formerly beheld Richelieu regulating with
</p>
<p>Joseph the interests of the State, were still seated the
</p>
<p>same men, nearly as we have described them. The
</p>
<p>minister, however, had grown much older in three

<p>years of suffering ; and the Capuchin was as much
</p>
<p>188 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>terrified with the result of his expedition as his mas-
</p>
<p>ter appeared tranquil.
</p>
<p>The cardinal, seated in his armchair, his legs bound
</p>
<p>and encased with furs and warm clothing, had upon his
</p>
<p>knees three kittens, which gambolled upon his scarlet
</p>
<p>robe. Every now and then he took one of them and
</p>
<p>placed it upon the others, to continue their sport. He
</p>
<p>smiled as he watched them. On his feet lay their
</p>
<p>mother, looking like an enormous animated muff.
</p>
<p>Joseph, seated near him, was going over the account
</p>
<p>of all he had heard in the confessional. Pale even
</p>
<p>now, at the danger he had run of being discovered, or
</p>
<p>of being murdered by Jacques, he concluded thus,
</p>
<p>" In short, your Eminence, I cannot help feeling agi-
</p>
<p>tated to my heart's core when I reflect upon the dan-
</p>
<p>gers which have, and still do, threaten you. Assassins
</p>
<p>offer themselves to poniard you. I behold in France
</p>
<p>the whole court against you, one half of the army, and
</p>
<p>two provinces. Abroad, Spain and Portugal are ready
</p>
<p>to furnish troops. Everywhere there are snares or bat-
</p>
<p>tles, poniards or cannon."
</p>
<p>The cardinal yawned three times, without discontinu-
</p>
<p>ing his amusement, and then said,
</p>
<p>" A cat is a very fine animal. It is a drawing-room
</p>
<p>tiger. What suppleness, what extraordinary finesse !
</p>
<p>Here is this little yellow one pretending to sleep, in
</p>
<p>order that the tortoise-shell one may not notice it, but
</p>
<p>fall upon its brother ; and this one, how it tears the
</p>
<p>other ! See how it sticks its claws into its side ! It
</p>
<p>would kill and eat it, I fully believe, if it were the

</p>

</p>
<p>He coughed and sneezed for some time ; then he
</p>
<p>continued,
</p>
<p>" Messire Joseph, I sent word to you not to speak to
</p>
<p>me of business until after my supper. I have an appe-
</p>
<p>tite now, and it is not yet my hour. Chicot, my doctor,
</p>
<p>recommends regularity, and I feel my usual pain in my
</p>
<p>side. This is how I shall spend the evening," he added,
</p>
<p>looking at the clock. " At nine, we will settle the af-
</p>
<p>fairs of M. le Grand. At ten, I shall be carried round
</p>
<p>the garden to take the air by moonlight. Then I shall
</p>
<p>sleep for an hour or two. At midnight the king will be
</p>
<p>here ; and at four o'clock you may return to receive the
</p>
<p>various orders for arrests, condemnations, or any others
</p>
<p>I may have to give you, for the provinces, Paris, or the
</p>
<p>armies of his Majesty."
</p>
<p>Richelieu said all this in the same tone of voice, with
</p>
<p>a uniform enunciation, affected only by the weakness of
</p>
<p>his chest, and the loss of several teeth.
</p>
<p>It was seven in the evening. The Capuchin with-
</p>
<p>drew. The cardinal supped with the greatest tranquil-
</p>
<p>lity ; and when the clock struck half-past eight, he sent
</p>
<p>for Joseph, and said to him, when he was seated,
</p>
<p>" This, then, is all they have been able to do against
</p>
<p>me during more than two years. They are poor crea-
</p>
<p>tures, truly ! The Due de Bouillon, whom I thought
</p>
<p>possessed some ability, has forfeited all claim to my
</p>
<p>opinion. I have watched him closely ; and I ask you,
</p>
<p>has he taken one step worthy of a true statesman ?
</p>
<p>The king, Monsieur, and the rest, have only shown their
</p>
<p>teeth against me, and without depriving me of one sin-

</p>
<p>them who has any consecutiveness of ideas. All that
</p>
<p>he has done has been done surprisingly well. I must
</p>
<p>do him justice ; he had good qualities. I should have
</p>
<p>made him my pupil, had it not been for his obstinate
</p>
<p>character. But he has here charged me a Voutrance^
</p>
<p>and must take the consequences. I am sorry for him.
</p>
<p>I have left them to float about in open water for the
</p>
<p>last two years. I shall now draw the net."
</p>
<p>"It is time, Monseigneur," said Joseph, who often
</p>
<p>trembled involuntarily as he spoke. " Do you bear in
</p>
<p>mind that from Perpignan to Narbonne the way is
</p>
<p>short ? Do you know that if your army here is power-
</p>
<p>ful, your own troops are weak and uncertain ; that
</p>
<p>the young nobles are furious ; and that the king is not
</p>
<p>sure ? "
</p>
<p>The cardinal looked at the clock.
</p>
<p>" It is only half-past eight, Joseph. I have already
</p>
<p>told you that I will not talk about this affair until nine.
</p>
<p>Meantime, as justice must be done, you will write what
</p>
<p>I shall dictate, for my memory serves me well. There
</p>
<p>are still some objectionable persons left, I see by my
</p>
<p>notes, four of the judges of Urbain Grandier. He
</p>
<p>was a rare genius, that Urbain Grandier," he added,
</p>
<p>with a malicious expression. Joseph bit his lips. " All
</p>
<p>the other judges have died miserably. As to Houmain,
</p>
<p>he shall be hanged as a smuggler by-and-by. We may
</p>
<p>leave him alone for the present. But there is that horri-
</p>
<p>ble Lactantius, who lives peacefully, Barre", and Mignon.

</p>
<p>with the shortest possible delay to the town of Lyons, with
</p>
<p>Father Lactantius, Capuchin, to be tried before a special
</p>
<p>tribunal, charged with criminal intentions against the
</p>
<p>State."
</p>
<p>Joseph wrote as coolly as a Turk strikes off a head at
</p>
<p>a sign from his master. The cardinal said to him, while
</p>
<p>signing the letter,
</p>
<p>" I will let you know how I wish them to disappear,
</p>
<p>for it is important to efface all traces of that affair.
</p>
<p>Providence has served me well. In removing these
</p>
<p>men, I complete its work. That is all that posterity
</p>
<p>shall know of the affair."
</p>
<p>And he read to the Capuchin that page of his memoirs
</p>
<p>in which he recounts the possession and sorceries of the
</p>
<p>magician. 1 During this slow process, Joseph could not
</p>
<p>help looking at the clock.
</p>
<p>" You are anxious to come to M. le Grand," said the
</p>
<p>cardinal at last. " Well, then, to please you, let us
</p>
<p>begin.
</p>
<p>" Do you think I have not my reasons for being tran-
</p>
<p>quil ? You think that I have allowed these poor con-
</p>
<p>spirators to go too far. No, no ! Here are some little
</p>
<p>papers that would reassure you, did you know their
</p>
<p>contents. First, in this hollow stick is the treaty with
</p>
<p>Spain, seized at Oleron. I am well satisfied with Lau-
</p>
<p>bardemont ; he is an able man."
</p>
<p>The fire of ferocious jealousy sparkled under the thick
</p>
<p>eyebrows of the monk.
</p>
<p>" Ah, Monseigneur," said he, " you know not from
</p>
<p>whom he seized it. He certainly suffered him to die,

</p>
<p>and in that respect we cannot complain, for he was the
</p>
<p>agent of the conspiracy ; but it was his son."
</p>
<p>" Say you the truth ? " cried the cardinal, in a severe
</p>
<p>tone. " Yes, for you dare not lie to me. How knew
</p>
<p>you this ? "
</p>
<p>" From his attendants, Monseigneur. Here are their
</p>
<p>reports. They will testify to them."
</p>
<p>The cardinal having examined these papers, said,
</p>
<p>" We will employ him once more to try our conspira-
</p>
<p>tors, and then you shall do as you like with him. I
</p>
<p>give him to you."
</p>
<p>Joseph joyfully pocketed his precious denunciations,
</p>
<p>and continued,
</p>
<p>" Your Eminence speaks of trying men who are still
</p>
<p>armed and on horseback."
</p>
<p>" They are not all so. Read this letter from Monsieur
</p>
<p>to. Chavigny. He asks for pardon. He dared not ad-

<p>him ; he could not keep it down. But I am not so
</p>
<p>easily satisfied. I must have a free and full confession,
</p>
<p>or I will expel him from the kingdom. I have written
</p>
<p>to him this morning. 1 As to the magnificent and power-
</p>
<p>ful Due de Bouillon, sovereign lord of Sedan and general-
</p>
<p>in-chief of the armies in Italy, he has just been arrested
</p>
<p>by his officers in the midst of his soldiers, concealed in
</p>
<p>a truss of straw. There remain, therefore, only our two
</p>
<p>young neighbors. They imagine they have the camp
</p>
<p>wholly at their orders, while they really have only the
</p>
<p>red, troops. All the rest, being Monsieur's men, will not
</p>
<p>act, and my troops will arrest them. However, I have
</p>
<p>permitted them to appear to obey. If they give the
</p>
<p>signal at half-past eleven, they will be arrested at the
</p>
<p>first step. If not, the king will give them up to me this
</p>
<p>evening. Do not open your eyes so wide. He will give
</p>
<p>them up to me, I repeat, this night, between midnight
</p>
<p>and one o'clock. You see that all has been done
</p>
<p>without you, Joseph. We can dispense with you very
</p>
<p>well ; and truly, all this time, I do not see that we
</p>
<p>Majesty have always made me doubtful of him and his artifices. For
</p>
<p>you, my cousin, I retain my whole esteem. I am truly repentant at hav-
</p>
<p>ing again been wanting in the fidelity I owe to my Lord the King, and I
</p>
<p>call God to witness the sincerity with which I shall be for the rest of my
</p>
<p>life your most faithful friend, with the same devotion that I am, my

<p>cousin, your affectionate cousin, GASTON.

</p>
<p>MONSIEUR, Since God wills that men should have recourse to a frank
</p>
<p>and entire confession to be absolved of their faults in this world, I indi-
</p>
<p>cate to you the steps you must take to be delivered from this danger.
</p>
<p>Your Highness has commenced well ; you must continue. This is all

<p>I can say to you.

<p>The cardinal laughed contemptuously, leaning back in
</p>
<p>his chair.

<p>like the language, Father Joseph ? . Tell me, dost thou
</p>
<p>clearly understand it ? I doubt whether thou hast formed
</p>
<p>a very refined idea of it."
</p>
<p>Richelieu, his arms crossed, looked at his discomfited
</p>
<p>Capuchin with infinite delight, and continued in the
</p>
<p>scornfully familiar tone of a grand seigneur, which he
</p>
<p>sometimes assumed, pleasing himself with putting
</p>
<p>forth the noblest expressions through the most im-
</p>
<p>pure lips :
</p>
<p>" Come, now, Joseph, give me a definition of love ac-
</p>
<p>cording to thy idea. What can it be ? for thou seest it
</p>
<p>exists out of romances ; this worthy youngster undertook
</p>
<p>these little conspiracies through love. Thou heardst it
</p>
<p>thyself with thine unworthy ears. Come, what is love ?
</p>
<p>for my part, I know nothing about it."
</p>
<p>The monk was astounded, and looked upon the ground
</p>
<p>with the stupid eye of some base animal. After long
</p>
<p>consideration, he replied in a drawling and nasal voice :
</p>
<p>" It must be a kind of malignant fever which leads

</p>
<p>never reflected on it until this moment. I have always
</p>
<p>been embarrassed in speaking to a woman. I wish
</p>
<p>women could be omitted from society altogether ; for I
</p>
<p>do not see what use they are, unless it be to disclose
</p>
<p>secrets, like the little duchesse or Marion de Lorme,
</p>
<p>whom I cannot too strongly recommend to your Emi-
</p>
<p>nence. She thought of everything, and herself threw
</p>
<p>our little prophecy among the conspirators with great
</p>
<p>address. We have not been without the marvellous this
</p>
<p>time. As in the siege of Hesdin, all we have to do is to
</p>
<p>find a window through which you may pass on the day of
</p>
<p>the execution" 1
</p>
<p>" This is another of your absurdities, sir," said the
</p>
<p>cardinal ; " you will make me as ridiculous as yourself,
</p>
<p>if you go on so ; I am too powerful to need the assistance
</p>
<p>of Heaven. Do not let that happen again. Occupy your-
</p>
<p>self only with the people I consign to you. I traced your
</p>
<p>part before. When the master of the horse is taken,
</p>
<p>you will see him tried and executed at Lyons. I will
</p>
<p>not be known in this. This affair is beneath me ; it is
</p>
<p>a stone under my feet, upon which I ought not to have
</p>
<p>bestowed so much attention."
</p>
<p>Joseph was silent ; he could not understand this man,
</p>
<p>who, surrounded on every side by armed enemies, spoke
</p>
<p>of the future as of a present over which he had the en-
</p>
<p>tire control, and of the present as a past which he no
</p>
<p>longer feared. He knew not whether to look upon him

<p>as a madman or a prophet, above or below the standard
</p>
<p>of human nature.
</p>
<p>His astonishment was redoubled when Chavigny hastily
</p>
<p>entered, and nearly falling, in his heavy boots, over the
</p>
<p>cardinal's footstool, exclaimed in great agitation,
</p>
<p>" Sir, one of your servants has just arrived from Per-
</p>
<p>pignan ; and he has beheld the camp in an uproar, and
</p>
<p>your enemies in the saddle."
</p>
<p>" They will soon dismount, sir," replied Richelieu,
</p>
<p>replacing his footstool. " You appear to have lost your
</p>
<p>equanimity."
</p>
<p>" But but, Monseigneur, must we not warn M. de
</p>
<p>Fabert ? "
</p>
<p>" Let him sleep, and go to bed yourself ; and you
</p>
<p>also, Joseph."
</p>
<p>" Monseigneur, another strange event has occurred,
</p>
<p>the king has arrived."
</p>
<p>" Indeed ! that is extraordinary," said the minister,
</p>
<p>looking at his watch. " I did not expect him these two
</p>
<p>hours. Retire, both of you."
</p>
<p>A heavy trampling and the clattering of arms an-
</p>
<p>nounced the arrival of the prince ; the folding-doors
</p>
<p>were thrown open ; the guards in the cardinal's ser-
</p>
<p>vice struck the ground thrice with their pikes ; and the
</p>
<p>king appeared.
</p>
<p>He entered, supporting himself with a cane on one
</p>
<p>side, and on the other leaning upon the shoulder of his
</p>
<p>confessor, Father Sirmond, who withdrew, and left him
</p>
<p>with the cardinal ; the latter rose with difficulty, but
</p>
<p>could not advance a step to meet the king, because his

</p>
<p>that they should assist the king to a seat near the fire,
</p>
<p>facing himself. Louis XIII. fell into an armchair fur-
</p>
<p>nished with pillows, asked for and drank a glass of
</p>
<p>cordial, prepared to strengthen him against the frequent
</p>
<p>fainting-fits caused by his malady of languor, signed to
</p>
<p>all to leave the room, and, alone with Richelieu, he said
</p>
<p>in a languid voice,
</p>
<p>" I am departing, my dear cardinal ; I feel that I shall
</p>
<p>soon return to God. I become weaker from day to day ;
</p>
<p>neither the summer nor the southern air has restored
</p>
<p>my strength."
</p>
<p>" I shall precede your Majesty," replied the minister.
</p>
<p>" You see that death has already conquered my limbs ;
</p>
<p>but while I have a head to think and a hand to write, I
</p>
<p>shall be at the service of your Majesty."
</p>
<p>" And I am sure it was your intention to add, ' a heart
</p>
<p>to love me.' "
</p>
<p>" Can your Majesty doubt it ? " answered the cardinal,
</p>
<p>frowning, and biting his lips impatiently at this speech.
</p>
<p>" Sometimes I doubt it," replied the prince. " Listen :
</p>
<p>I wish to speak openly to you, and to complain of you to
</p>
<p>yourself. There are two things which have been upon
</p>
<p>my conscience these three years. I have never men-
</p>
<p>tioned them to you ; but I reproached you secretly, and
</p>
<p>could anything have induced me to consent to any
</p>
<p>proposals contrary to your interest, it would be this
</p>
<p>recollection."
</p>
<p>There was in this speech that frankness natural to
</p>
<p>weak minds, who seek by thus making their ruler un-
</p>
<p>easy, to compensate for the harm they dare not do him,

<p>and revenge their subjection by a childish controversy.

</p>
<p>Richelieu perceived by these words that he had run a
</p>
<p>great risk ; but he saw at the same time the necessity of
</p>
<p>venting all his spleen, and to facilitate the explosion of
</p>
<p>these important avowals, he accumulated all the profes-
</p>
<p>sions he thought most calculated to provoke the king.
</p>
<p>" No, no ! " his Majesty at length exclaimed, " I shall
</p>
<p>believe nothing until you have explained those two things,
</p>
<p>which are always in my thoughts, which were lately men-
</p>
<p>tioned to me, and which I can justify by no reasoning.
</p>
<p>I mean the trial of Urbain Grandier, of which I was
</p>
<p>never well informed, and the reason for the hatred you
</p>
<p>bore to my unfortunate mother, even to her very ashes."
</p>
<p>"Is this all, Sire?" said Richelieu. " Are these my
</p>
<p>only faults ? They are easily explained. The first it
</p>
<p>was necessary to conceal from your Majesty because of
</p>
<p>its horrible and disgusting details of scandal. There was
</p>
<p>certainly an art employed which cannot be looked upon
</p>
<p>as guilty, in concealing under the title of ' magic ' crimes,
</p>
<p>the very names of which are revolting to modesty, the
</p>
<p>recital of which would have revealed dangerous myste-
</p>
<p>ries to the innocent ; this was a holy deceit practised to
</p>
<p>hide these impurities from the eyes of the people."
</p>
<p>" Enough, enough, Cardinal," said Louis XIII., turn-
</p>
<p>ing away his head, and looking downwards, while a
</p>
<p>blush covered his face ; " I cannot hear more. I under-
</p>
<p>stand you ; these explanations would disgust me. I
</p>
<p>approve your motives ; 't is well. I had not been told
</p>
<p>that ; they had concealed these dreadful vices from me.
</p>
<p>Are you assured of the proofs of these crimes ? "
</p>

<p>the glorious queen, Marie de M^diois, T am surprised that
</p>
<p>THE WORK. 199
</p>
<p>your Majesty can forget how much I was attached to
</p>
<p>her. Yes, I do not fear to acknowledge it ; it is to her
</p>
<p>I owe my elevation. She was the first who deigned to
</p>
<p>notice the Bishop of Lu9on, then only twenty-two years
</p>
<p>of age, to place me near her. What have I not suffered
</p>
<p>when she compelled me to oppose her in your Majesty's
</p>
<p>interest ! But this sacrifice was made for you. I never
</p>
<p>have, and never shall, regret it."
</p>
<p>" 'T is well for you, but for me ! " said the prince,
</p>
<p>bitterly.
</p>
<p>" Ah, Sire," exclaimed the cardinal, " did not the
</p>
<p>Son of God himself set you an example ? It is by the
</p>
<p>model of every perfection that we regulate our counsels ;
</p>
<p>and if the monument due to the precious remains of
</p>
<p>your mother is not yet raised, Heaven is my witness
</p>
<p>that the works were retarded through the fear of
</p>
<p>afflicting your heart by bringing back the recollection
</p>
<p>of her death. But blessed be the day in which I have
</p>
<p>been permitted to speak to you on the subject ! I my-
</p>
<p>self shall say the first Mass at St. Denis, when we shall
</p>
<p>see her deposited there, if Providence allows me the
</p>
<p>strength."
</p>
<p>The countenance of the king assumed a more affable
</p>
<p>yet still cold expression ; and the cardinal, thinking that
</p>
<p>he could go no farther that evening in persuasion, sud-
</p>
<p>denly resolved to make a more powerful move, and to
</p>
<p>attack the enemy in front. Still keeping his eyes firmly
</p>
<p>fixed upon the king, he said coldly,
</p>
<p>" And was it for this you consented to my death ? "
</p>
<p>" Me ! " said the king. " You have been deceived ; I

<p>have indeed heard of a conspiracy, and I wished to
</p>
<p>200 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>speak to you about it ; but I have commanded nothing
</p>
<p>against you."
</p>
<p>" The conspirators do not say so, Sire ; but I am
</p>
<p>bound to believe your Majesty, and I am glad for your
</p>
<p>sake that men were deceived. But what -advice were
</p>
<p>you about to condescend to give me?"
</p>
<p>"I I wished to tell you frankly, and between our-
</p>
<p>selves, that you will do well to beware of Monsieur "
</p>
<p>" Ah, Sire, I cannot now heed it ; for here is a letter
</p>
<p>which he has just sent to me for you. He seems to have
</p>
<p>been guilty even towards your Majesty."
</p>
<p>The king read in astonishment :
</p>
<p>MONSEIGNEUR, I am much grieved at having once more
</p>
<p>failed in the fidelity which I owe to your Majest}'. I humbly
</p>
<p>entreat you to allow me to ask a thousand pardons, with the
</p>
<p>assurances of my submission and repentance.
</p>
<p>Your very humble servant,
</p>
<p>GASTON.
</p>
<p>" What does this mean ? " cried Louis ; " dare they
</p>
<p>arm against me also ? "
</p>
<p>" Also ! " muttered the cardinal, biting his lips ;
</p>
<p>" yes, Sire, also ; and this makes me believe, to a
</p>
<p>certain degree, this little packet of papers."
</p>
<p>While speaking, he drew a roll of parchment from a
</p>
<p>piece of hollowed elder, and opened it before the eyes of
</p>
<p>the king.
</p>
<p>" This is simply a treaty with Spain, which I think
</p>
<p>does not bear the signature of your Majesty. You may
</p>
<p>see the twenty articles all in due form. Everything is
</p>
<p>here arranged, the place of safety, the number of

</p>
<p>" The traitors ! " cried the king, in great agitation ;
</p>
<p>" they must be seized. My brother renounces them and
</p>
<p>repents ; but do not fail to arrest the Due de Bouillon."
</p>
<p>" It shall be done, Sire."
</p>
<p>" That will be difficult, in the middle of the army in
</p>
<p>Italy."
</p>
<p>" I will answer with my head for his arrest, Sire ; but
</p>
<p>is there not another name to be added ? "
</p>
<p>" Who what Cinq-Mars ? " inquired the king,
</p>
<p>hesitating.
</p>
<p>" Exactly so, Sire," answered the cardinal.
</p>
<p>" I see but I think we might "
</p>
<p>" Hear me ! " exclaimed Richelieu, in a voice of thun-
</p>
<p>der ; " all must be settled to-day. Your favorite is
</p>
<p>mounted at the head of his party ; choose between him
</p>
<p>and me. Yield up the boy to the man, or the man to
</p>
<p>the boy ; there is no alternative."
</p>
<p>" And what will you do if I consent ? " said the king.
</p>
<p>" I will have his head and that of his friend."
</p>
<p>" Never ! it is impossible ! " replied the king, with
</p>
<p>horror, as he relapsed into the same state of irresolution
</p>
<p>he evinced when with Cinq-Mars against Richelieu.
</p>
<p>" He is my friend as well as you ; my heart bleeds at
</p>
<p>the idea of his death. Why can you not both agree ?
</p>
<p>Why this division ? It is that which has led him to
</p>
<p>this. You have between you brought me to the brink
</p>
<p>of despair ; you have made me the most miserable
</p>
<p>of men."
</p>
<p>Louis hid his head in his hands while speaking, and
</p>
<p>perhaps he shed tears ; but the inflexible minister kept

</p>
<p>remorse, without giving the king time for reflection,
</p>
<p>on the contrary, profiting by this emotion to speak yet
</p>
<p>longer.
</p>
<p>"And is it thus," he continued in a harsh and cold
</p>
<p>voice, " that you remember the commandments of God
</p>
<p>communicated to you by the mouth of your confessor ?
</p>
<p>You told me one day that the Church expressly com-
</p>
<p>manded you to reveal to your prime minister all that
</p>
<p>you might hear against him ; yet I have never heard
</p>
<p>from you of my intended death ! It was necessary that
</p>
<p>more faithful friends should apprise me of this con-
</p>
<p>spiracy ; that the guilty themselves through the mercy
</p>
<p>of Providence should themselves make the avowal of
</p>
<p>their fault. One only, the most guilty, yet the least of
</p>
<p>all, still resists, and it is he who has conducted the
</p>
<p>whole ; it is he who would deliver France into the
</p>
<p>power of the foreigner, who would overthrow in one
</p>
<p>single day my labors of twenty years. He would call up
</p>
<p>the Huguenots of the south, invite to arms all orders
</p>
<p>of the State, revive crushed pretensions, and, in fact,
</p>
<p>renew the League which was put down by your father.
</p>
<p>It is that, do not deceive yourself, it is that which
</p>
<p>raises so many heads against you. Are you prepared
</p>
<p>for the combat ? If so, where are your arms ? "
</p>
<p>The king, quite overwhelmed, made no reply ; he still
</p>
<p>covered his face with his hands. The stony-hearted
</p>
<p>cardinal crossed his arms and continued,
</p>
<p>" I fear that you imagine it is for myself I speak.
</p>
<p>Do you really think that I do not know my own
</p>
<p>powers, and that I fear such an adversary ? Really, I

<p>THE WORK. 203
</p>
<p>yourself, from transferring the immense burden of
</p>
<p>State affairs to the shoulders of this youth. You may
</p>
<p>imagine that since the twenty years I have been ac-
</p>
<p>quainted with your court, I have not forgotten to assure
</p>
<p>myself a retreat where, in spite of you, I could now go to
</p>
<p>live the six months which perhaps remain to me of life.
</p>
<p>It would be a curious employment for me to watch the
</p>
<p>progress of such a reign. What answer would you re-
</p>
<p>turn, for instance, when all the inferior potentates, re-
</p>
<p>gaining their station, no longer kept in subjection by
</p>
<p>me, shall come in your brother's name to say to you,
</p>
<p>as they dared to say to Henri IY. on his throne :
</p>
<p>' Divide with us all the hereditary governments and
</p>
<p>sovereignties, and we shall be content.' l You will
</p>
<p>doubtless accede to their request ; and it is the least
</p>
<p>you can do for those who will have delivered you from
</p>
<p>Richelieu. It will, perhaps, be fortunate, for to govern
</p>
<p>the He de France, which they will no doubt allow you as
</p>
<p>the original domain, your new minister will not require
</p>
<p>many secretaries."
</p>
<p>While speaking thus, he furiously pushed the huge
</p>
<p>table, which nearly filled the room, and was laden with
</p>
<p>papers and numerous portfolios.
</p>
<p>Louis was aroused from his apathetic meditation by
</p>
<p>the excessive audacity of this discourse. He raised his
</p>
<p>head, and seemed to have instantly formed one resolu-
</p>
<p>tion for fear he should adopt another.
</p>
<p>" Well, sir," said he, " my answer is that I will reign
</p>
<p>alone."
</p>
<p>" Be it so ! " replied Richelieu. " But I ought to give

</p>
<p>you notice that affairs are at present somewhat com-
</p>
<p>plicated. This is the hour when I generally commence
</p>
<p>my ordinary avocations."
</p>
<p>" I will act in your place," said Louis. " I will open
</p>
<p>the portfolios and issue my commands."
</p>
<p>" Try, then," said Richelieu. " I shall retire ; and
</p>
<p>if anything causes you to hesitate, you can send for
</p>
<p>me."
</p>
<p>He rang a bell. In the same instant, and as if they
</p>
<p>had awaited the signal, four vigorous footmen entered,
</p>
<p>and carried him and his chair into another apartment,
</p>
<p>for we have before remarked that he was unable to
</p>
<p>walk. While passing through the chambers where the
</p>
<p>secretaries were at work, he called out in a loud
</p>
<p>voice,
</p>
<p>" You will receive his Majesty's commands."
</p>
<p>The king remained alone, strong in his new resolu-
</p>
<p>tion, and proud in having once resisted, he became anx-
</p>
<p>ious immediately to plunge into political business. He
</p>
<p>walked round the immense table, and beheld as many
</p>
<p>portfolios as they then counted empires, kingdoms, and
</p>
<p>States in Europe. He opened one and found it divided
</p>
<p>into sections equalling in number the subdivisions of
</p>
<p>the country to which it related. All was in order, but
</p>
<p>in alarming order for him, because each note only re-
</p>
<p>ferred to the very essence of the business it alluded to,
</p>
<p>and related only to the exact point of its then relations
</p>
<p>with France. These laconic notes proved as enigmas
</p>
<p>to Louis, as did the letters in cipher which covered the

<p>table. Here all was confusion. An edict of banish-

<p>General Bannier and Wallenstein, the Due de Weimar,
</p>
<p>and Jean de Witt, were pell-mell with extracts of letters
</p>
<p>taken from the casket of the queen, the list of the neck-
</p>
<p>laces and jewels they contained, and the double inter-
</p>
<p>pretation which might be put upon every phrase of her
</p>
<p>notes. Upon the margin of one of these letters was
</p>
<p>written : " For four lines in a man's handwriting he
</p>
<p>might be criminally tried." Farther on were scattered
</p>
<p>denunciations against the Huguenots ; the republican
</p>
<p>plans they had drawn up ; the division of France into
</p>
<p>departments under the annual dictatorship of a chief.
</p>
<p>The seal of this projected State was affixed to it, repre-
</p>
<p>senting an angel leaning upon a cross, and holding in
</p>
<p>his hand a Bible, which he raised to his forehead. By
</p>
<p>the side was a document which contained a list of those
</p>
<p>cardinals the pope had selected the same day as the
</p>
<p>Bishop of Lugon (Richelieu). Among them was to be
</p>
<p>found the Marquis de Be*demar, ambassador and con-
</p>
<p>spirator at Venice.
</p>
<p>Louis XIII. exhausted his powers in vain over the
</p>
<p>details of another period, seeking unsuccessfully for any
</p>
<p>documents which might allude to the present conspiracy,
</p>
<p>to enable him to perceive its true knot, and all that had
</p>
<p>been attempted against him, when a diminutive man, of
</p>
<p>an olive complexion, who stooped much, entered the
</p>
<p>cabinet with a measured step. This was a secretary of
</p>
<p>State named Desnoyers. He advanced, bowing.

</p>
<p>206 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" And consequently of Spain? "said Louis. "Portu-
</p>
<p>gal is a province of Spain."
</p>
<p>" Of Portugal," reiterated Desnoyers. " Here is the
</p>
<p>manifesto we have this moment received." And he
</p>
<p>read, " Don John, by the grace of God, King of Por-
</p>
<p>tugal and of Algarves, kingdoms on this side of Africa,
</p>
<p>lord over Guinea, by conquest, navigation, and trade
</p>
<p>with Arabia, Persia, and the Indies "
</p>
<p>" What is all that ? " said the king. " Who talks in
</p>
<p>this manner?"
</p>
<p>" The Duke of Braganza, King of Portugal, crowned
</p>
<p>already some time by a man whom they call Pinto.
</p>
<p>Scarcely has he ascended the throne than he offers as-
</p>
<p>sistance to the revolted Catalonians."
</p>
<p>" Has Catalonia also revolted ? The king, Philip IV.,
</p>
<p>no longer has the count-duke for his prime minister ? "
</p>
<p>" Just the contrary, Sire. It is on this very account.
</p>
<p>Here is the declaration of the states-general of Cata-
</p>
<p>lonia to his Catholic Majesty, signifying that the whole
</p>
<p>country will take up arms against his sacrilegious and
</p>
<p>excommunicated troops. The King of Portugal "
</p>
<p>" Say the Duke of Braganza ! " replied Louis. " I
</p>
<p>recognize no rebels."
</p>
<p>" The Duke of Braganza, then," coldly repeated the
</p>
<p>secretary of State, " sends his nephew, Don Igna^io de
</p>
<p>Mascarenas, to the principality of Catalonia, to seize
</p>
<p>the protection (and it may be the sovereignty) of
</p>
<p>that country, which he would add to that he has

</p>
<p>" Well, and what of that ?" said Louis.
</p>
<p>THE WORK.
</p>
<p>" The Catalonians are more disposed towards France
</p>
<p>than towards Portugal, and there i-s still time to deprive
</p>
<p>the King of the Duke of Portugal, I should say, of
</p>
<p>this protectorship."
</p>
<p>" What ! I assist rebels ! You dare "
</p>
<p>" Such was the intention of his Eminence," continued
</p>
<p>the secretary of State. " Spain and France are nearly
</p>
<p>at open war, and M. d'01ivars has not hesitated to
</p>
<p>offer the assistance of his Catholic Majesty to the
</p>
<p>Huguenots."
</p>
<p>" Very good. I will consider it," said the king.
</p>
<p>" Leave me."
</p>
<p>" Sire, the states-general of Catalonia are in a di-
</p>
<p>lemma. The troops from Aragon march against them."
</p>
<p>" We shall see. I will come to a decision in a quarter
</p>
<p>of an hour," answered Louis XIII.
</p>
<p>The little secretary of State left the apartment dis-
</p>
<p>contented and discouraged. In his place Chavigny im-
</p>
<p>mediately appeared, holding a portfolio, on which were
</p>
<p>emblazoned the arms of England. " Sire," said he, " I
</p>
<p>have to request your Majesty's commands upon the af-
</p>
<p>fairs of England. The Parliamentarians, commanded by
</p>
<p>the Earl of Essex, have raised the siege of Gloucester.
</p>
<p>Prince Rupert has at Newbury fought a disastrous bat-
</p>
<p>tle, and of little profit to his Britannic Majesty. The
</p>
<p>Parliament is prolonged. All the principal cities take
</p>
<p>part with it, together with all the seaports and the
</p>
<p>Presbyterian population. King Charles I. implores as-
</p>
<p>sistance, which the queen can no longer obtain from
</p>
<p>Holland."

<p>" Troops must be sent to my brother of England,"
</p>
<p>208 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>said Louis ; but he wanted to look over the preceding
</p>
<p>papers, and casting his eyes over the notes of the car-
</p>
<p>dinal, he found that under a former request of the King
</p>
<p>of England he had written with his own hand,
</p>
<p>" We must consider some time and wait. The commons
</p>
<p>are strong. King Charles reckons upon the Scots ; they
</p>
<p>will sell him.
</p>
<p>" We must be cautious. A warlike man has been over
</p>
<p>to see Vincennes, and he has said that ' princes ought never
</p>
<p>to be struck, except on the head.' "
</p>
<p>The cardinal had added " remarkable," but he had
</p>
<p>erased this word and substituted " formidable." Again,
</p>
<p>beneath,
</p>
<p>" This man rules Fairfax. He plays an inspired part.
</p>
<p>He will be a great man assistance refused money lost."
</p>
<p>The king then said, " No, no ! do nothing hastily. I
</p>
<p>shall wait."
</p>
<p>" But, Sire," said Chavigny, " events pass rapidly. If
</p>
<p>the courier be delayed, the king's destruction may hap-
</p>
<p>pen a year sooner."
</p>
<p>" Have they advanced so far ? " asked Louis.
</p>
<p>" In the camp of the Independents they preach up
</p>
<p>the republic with the Bible in their hands. In that of
</p>
<p>the Royalists, they dispute for precedency, and amuse
</p>
<p>themselves."
</p>
<p>" But one turn of good fortune may save everything ? "
</p>
<p>" The Stuarts are not fortunate, Sire," answered
</p>
<p>Chavigny, respectfully, but in a tone which left ample
</p>
<p>room for consideration.
</p>
<p>" Leave me," said the king, with some displeasure.

<p>THE WORK. 209
</p>
<p>It was then that Louis XIII. beheld himself as he
</p>
<p>really was, and was terrified at the nothingness he found
</p>
<p>in himself. He at first stared at the mass of papers
</p>
<p>which surrounded him, passing from one to the other,
</p>
<p>finding dangers on every side, and finding them still
</p>
<p>greater with the remedies he invented. He rose ; arid
</p>
<p>changing his place, he bent over, or rather threw him-
</p>
<p>self upon, a geographical map of Europe. There he
</p>
<p>found all his fears concentrated. In the north, the
</p>
<p>south, the very centre of the kingdom, revolutions ap-
</p>
<p>peared to him like so many Eume'nides. In every
</p>
<p>country he thought he saw a volcano ready to burst
</p>
<p>forth. He imagined he heard cries of distress from
</p>
<p>kings, who appealed to him for help, and the furious
</p>
<p>shouts of the populace. He fancied he felt the territory
</p>
<p>of France trembling and crumbling beneath his feet.
</p>
<p>His feeble and fatigued sight failed him. His weak
</p>
<p>head was attacked by vertigo, which threw all his blood
</p>
<p>back upon his heart.
</p>
<p>" Richelieu ! " he cried in a stifled voice, while he
</p>
<p>rang a bell ; " summon the cardinal immediately."
</p>
<p>And he swooned in an armchair.
</p>
<p>When the king opened his eyes, revived by salts and
</p>
<p>potent essences which had been applied to his lips and
</p>
<p>temples, he for one instant beheld himself surrounded
</p>
<p>by pages, who withdrew as soon as he opened his eyes,
</p>
<p>and he was once more left alone with the cardinal. The
</p>
<p>impassible minister had had his chair placed by that of
</p>
<p>the king, as a physician would seat himself by the bed-
</p>
<p>side of his patient, and fixed his sparkling and scrutiniz-
</p>
<p>ing eyes upon the pale countenance of Louis. As soon

<p>as his victim could hear him, he renewed his fearful dis-
</p>
<p>course in a hollow voice,
</p>
<p>" You have recalled me. What would you with me ? "
</p>
<p>Louis, who was reclining on the pillow, half opened
</p>
<p>his eyes, fixed them upon Richelieu, and hastily closed
</p>
<p>them again. That bony head, armed with two flaming
</p>
<p>eyes, and terminating in a pointed and grizzly beard,
</p>
<p>the cap and vestments of the color of blood and flames,
</p>
<p>all appeared to him like an infernal spirit.
</p>
<p>" You must reign," he said in a languid voice.
</p>
<p>" But will you give me up Cinq-Mars and De Thou ? "
</p>
<p>again urged the implacable minister, bending forward to
</p>
<p>read in the dull eyes of the prince, as an avaricious heir
</p>
<p>follows up, even to the tomb, the last glimpses of the
</p>
<p>will of a dying relative.
</p>
<p>"You must reign," repeated the king, turning away
</p>
<p>his head.
</p>
<p>" Sign then," said Richelieu ; " the contents of this are,
</p>
<p>4 This is my command, to take them, dead or alive.' "
</p>
<p>Louis, whose head still reclined on the raised back of
</p>
<p>the chair, suffered his hand to fall upon the fatal paper,
</p>
<p>and signed it. " For pity's sake, leave me ; I am dying ! "
</p>
<p>he said.
</p>
<p>" That is not yet all," continued he whom men call
</p>
<p>the great politician. " I place no reliance on you ; I
</p>
<p>must first have some guarantee and assurance. Sign
</p>
<p>this paper, and I will leave you :
</p>

</p>
<p>of the latter shall remain under arms ; and when the cardinal

</p>
<p>" Again :
</p>
<p>"His Majest}* undertakes to place the two princes, his
</p>
<p>sons, in the cardinal's hands, as hostages of the good faith
</p>
<p>of his attachment." *
</p>
<p>" My children ! " exclaimed Louis, raising his head,
</p>
<p>" dare you ? "
</p>
<p>" Would you rather that I should retire ? " said
</p>
<p>Richelieu.
</p>
<p>The king again signed.
</p>
<p>" Is all finished now ? " he inquired with a deep sigh.
</p>
<p>All was not finished ; one other grief was still in re-
</p>
<p>serve for him. The door was suddenly opened, and Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars entered. It was the cardinal who trembled now.
</p>
<p>"What would you here, sir?" said he, seizing the
</p>
<p>bell to ring for assistance.
</p>
<p>The master of the horse was as pale as the king, and
</p>
<p>without condescending to answer Richelieu, he advanced
</p>
<p>steadily towards Louis XIII., who looked at him with the
</p>
<p>air of a man who has just received a sentence of death.
</p>
<p>" You would, Sire, find it difficult to have me arrested,
</p>
<p>for I have twenty thousand men under my command,"
</p>
<p>said Henri d'Effiat, in a sweet and subdued voice.
</p>
<p>" Alas, Cinq-Mars ! " replied the king, sadly ; " is it
</p>
<p>thou who hast been guilty of these crimes ? "
</p>
<p>" Yes, Sire ; and I also bring you my sword, for no
</p>
<p>doubt you came here to surrender me," said he, unbuck-
</p>
<p>ling his sword, and laying it at the feet of the king, who
</p>
<p>fixed his eyes upon the floor without making any reply.
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars smiled sadly, but not bitterly, for he no
</p>
<p>longer belonged to this earth. Then looking contemptu-

</p>
<p>ously at Richelieu, " I surrender because I wish to die,
</p>
<p>but I am not conquered."
</p>
<p>The cardinal clinched his fist with passion ; but he re-
</p>
<p>strained his fury. " Who are your accomplices ? " he
</p>
<p>demanded. Cinq-Mars looked steadfastly at Louis, and
</p>
<p>half opened his lips to speak. The king bent down his
</p>
<p>head, and felt at that moment a torture unknown to all
</p>
<p>other men.
</p>
<p>" I have none," said Cinq-Mars, pitying the king ; and
</p>
<p>he slowly left the apartment. He stopped in the first
</p>
<p>gallery. Pabert and all the gentlemen rose on seeing
</p>
<p>him. He walked up to the commander, and said,
</p>
<p>" Sir, order these gentlemen to arrest me ! "
</p>
<p>They looked at each other, without daring to approach
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>" Yes, sir, I am your prisoner ; yes, gentlemen, I am
</p>
<p>without my sword, and I repeat to you that I am the
</p>
<p>king's prisoner."
</p>
<p>" I do not understand what I see," said the general ;
</p>
<p>" there are two of you who surrender, and I have no in-
</p>
<p>struction to arrest any one."

</p>
<p>AMONG those old chateaux of which France is every year
</p>
<p>deprived regretfully, as of flowers from her crown, there
</p>
<p>was one of a grim and savage appearance upon the left
</p>
<p>bank of the Sa<5ne. It looked like a formidable sentinel
</p>
<p>placed at one of the gates of Lyons, and derived its name
</p>
<p>from an enormous rock, known as Pierre-Encise, which
</p>
<p>terminates in a peak, a sort of natural pyramid, the
</p>
<p>summit of which overhanging the river in former times,
</p>
<p>they say, joined the rocks which may still be seen on
</p>
<p>the opposite bank, forming the natural arch of a bridge ;
</p>
<p>but time, the waters, and the hand of man, have left
</p>
<p>nothing standing but the ancient mass of granite which

</p>
<p>formed the pedestal of the now destroyed fortress.
</p>
<p>214 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>The archbishops of Lyons, as the temporal lords of
</p>
<p>the city, had built and formerly resided in this castle.
</p>
<p>It afterwards became a fortress, and during the reign of
</p>
<p>Louis XIII. a State prison. One colossal tower, where
</p>
<p>the daylight could only penetrate through three long
</p>
<p>loopholes, commanded the edifice, and some irregular
</p>
<p>buildings surrounded it with their massive walls, whose
</p>
<p>lines and angles followed the form of the immense and
</p>
<p>perpendicular rock.
</p>
<p>It was here that the cardinal, jealous of his prey, de-
</p>
<p>termined to imprison his young enemies, and to conduct
</p>
<p>them himself.
</p>
<p>Allowing Louis to precede him to Paris, he removed
</p>
<p>his captives from Narbonne, dragging them in his train
</p>
<p>to ornament his last triumph, and embarking on the
</p>
<p>Rhone at Tarascon, nearly at the mouth of the river, as
</p>
<p>if to prolong the pleasure of revenge which men have
</p>
<p>dared to call that of the gods, displayed to the eyes of
</p>
<p>the spectators on both sides of the river the luxury of
</p>
<p>his hatred ; he slowly proceeded on his course up the
</p>
<p>river in barges with gilded oars, and emblazoned with
</p>
<p>his armorial bearings, reclining in the first, and followed
</p>
<p>by his two victims in the second, which was fastened to
</p>
<p>his own by a long chain.
</p>
<p>Often in the evening, when the heat of the day was
</p>
<p>passed, the awnings of the two boats were removed, and
</p>
<p>in the one Richelieu might be seen, pale, and seated in
</p>
<p>the stern ; in that which followed, the two young prison-
</p>
<p>ers, calm and collected, supported each other, watching
</p>
<p>the passage of the rapid stream. Formerly the soldiers

<p>of Caesar, who encamped on the same shores, would

</p>
<p>have thought they beheld the inflexible boatman of the
</p>
<p>infernal regions conducting the friendly shades of Castor
</p>
<p>and Pollux. Christians dared not even reflect, or see a
</p>
<p>priest leading his two enemies to the scaffold ; it was
</p>
<p>the first minister who passed.
</p>
<p>Thus he went on his way until he left his victims
</p>
<p>under guard at the identical city in which the late con-
</p>
<p>spirators had doomed him to perish. Thus loved he to
</p>
<p>defy Fate herself, and to plant a trophy on the very spot
</p>
<p>which had been selected for his tomb.
</p>
<p>" He was borne," says an ancient manuscript journal of
</p>
<p>this 3*ear, "along the river Rhone in a boat in which a
</p>
<p>wooden chamber had been constructed, lined with crimson
</p>
<p>fluted velvet, the flooring of which was of gold. The same
</p>
<p>boat contained an antechamber decorated in the same man-
</p>
<p>ner. The prow and stern of the boat were occupied by
</p>
<p>soldiers and guai'ds, wearing scarlet coats embroidered with
</p>
<p>gold, silver, and silk ; and many lords of note. His Eminence
</p>
<p>occupied a bed hung with purple taffetas. Monseigneur the
</p>
<p>Cardinal Bigni, and Messeigneurs the Bishops of Nantes and
</p>
<p>Chartres, were there, with many abbes and gentlemen in other
</p>
<p>boats. Preceding his vessel, a boat sounded the passages,
</p>
<p>and another boat followed, filled with arquebusiers and
</p>
<p>officers to command them. When they approached any isle,
</p>
<p>the}' sent soldiers to inspect it, to discover whether it was
</p>
<p>occupied by any suspicious persons ; and not meeting any,
</p>
<p>they guarded the shore until two boats which followed had
</p>
<p>passed. They were filled with the nobility and well-armed
</p>
<p>soldiers.
</p>
<p>" Afterwards came the boat of his Eminence, to the stern
</p>
<p>of which was attached a little boat, which conveyed MM.

<p>which, played in Dauphine, were answered by those in Viva-
</p>
<p>rais, and repeated by the echoes of our rocks. It seemed as
</p>
<p>if all were trying which could play best." 1
</p>
<p>In the middle of a night of the month of September,
</p>
<p>while everything appeared to slumber in the impregna-
</p>
<p>ble tower which contained the prisoners, the door of
</p>
<p>their outer chamber turned noiselessly on its hinges,
</p>
<p>and a man appeared on the threshold, clad in a brown
</p>
<p>robe confined round his waist by a cord. His feet were
</p>
<p>encased in sandals, and his hand grasped a large bunch
</p>
<p>of keys ; it was Joseph. He looked cautiously round
</p>
<p>without advancing, and contemplated in silence the
</p>
<p>apartment occupied by the master of the horse. Thick
</p>
<p>carpets covered the floor, and large and splendid hang-
</p>
<p>ings concealed the walls of the prison ; a bed hung
</p>
<p>with red damask was prepared, but it was unoccupied.
</p>
<p>Seated near a high chimney in a large armchair, attired
</p>
<p>in a long gray robe similar in form to that of a priest,
</p>
<p>his head bent down, and his eyes fixed upon a little
</p>
<p>cross of gold by the flickering light of a lamp, he was
</p>
<p>absorbed in so deep a meditation that the Capuchin
</p>
<p>had leisure to approach him closely, and confront the
</p>
<p>prisoner before he perceived him. Suddenly, however,

<p>THE PRISONERS. 217
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars raised his head and exclaimed, " Wretch,
</p>
<p>what do you here ? "
</p>
<p>" Young man, you are violent," answered the myste-
</p>
<p>rious intruder, in a low voice. " Two months' imprison-
</p>
<p>ment ought to have been enough to calm you. I come
</p>
<p>to tell you things of great importance. Listen to me !
</p>
<p>I have thought much of you ; and I do not hate you so
</p>
<p>much as you imagine. The moments are precious. I
</p>
<p>will tell you all in a few words : in two hours you will
</p>
<p>be interrogated, tried, and condemned to death with
</p>
<p>your friend. It cannot be otherwise, for all will be
</p>
<p>finished the same day."
</p>
<p>" I know it," answered Cinq-Mars ; " and I am
</p>
<p>prepared."
</p>
<p>" Well, then, I can still release you from this affair.
</p>
<p>I have reflected deeply, as I told you; and I am here
</p>
<p>to make a proposal which can but give you satisfaction.
</p>
<p>The cardinal has but six months to live. Let us not be
</p>
<p>mysterious ; we must speak openly. You see where I
</p>
<p>have brought you to serve him ; and you can judge by
</p>
<p>that the point to which I would conduct him to serve
</p>
<p>you. If you wish it, we can cut short the six months of
</p>
<p>his life which still remain. The king loves you, and will
</p>
<p>recall you with joy when he finds you still live. You
</p>
<p>are, you may long live, powerful and happy ; you will
</p>
<p>protect me, and make me cardinal."
</p>
<p>Astonishment deprived the young prisoner of speech.
</p>
<p>He could not understand such language, and seemed to
</p>
<p>be unable to descend to it from his higher meditations.
</p>
<p>All that he could say was,

<p>" Your benefactor, Richelieu ? "
</p>
<p>218 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>The Capuchin smiled, and drawing nearer, continued
</p>
<p>in an undertone,
</p>
<p>"Policy admits of no benefits; it contains nothing but
</p>
<p>interest. A man employed by a minister is no more
</p>
<p>bound to be grateful than a horse whose rider prefers
</p>
<p>him to others. My pace has been convenient to him ;
</p>
<p>so much the better. Now it is my interest to throw him
</p>
<p>from the saddle. Yes, this man loves none but him-
</p>
<p>self. I now see that he has deceived me by continually
</p>
<p>retarding my elevation ; but once again, I possess the
</p>
<p>sure means for your escape in silence. I am the master
</p>
<p>here. I will remove the men in whom he trusts, and
</p>
<p>replace them by others whom he has condemned to die,
</p>
<p>and who are near at hand confined in the northern
</p>
<p>tower, the Tour des Oubliettes, which overhangs the
</p>
<p>river. His creatures shall occupy their places. I will
</p>
<p>recommend a physician an empyric who is devoted
</p>
<p>to me to the illustrious cardinal, who has been given
</p>
<p>over by the most scientific in Paris. If you will unite
</p>
<p>with me, he shall convey to him a universal and eternal
</p>
<p>remedy."
</p>
<p>" Away ! " exclaimed Cinq-Mars. " Leave me, thou
</p>
<p>infernal monk ! No, thou art like no other man !
</p>
<p>Thou glidest with a noiseless and furtive step through
</p>
<p>the darkness ; thou traversest the walls to preside
</p>
<p>at secret crimes ; thou placest thyself between the
</p>
<p>hearts of lovers to separate them eternally. Who art
</p>
<p>thou? Thou resemblest a tormented spirit of the
</p>
<p>damned ! "
</p>
<p>"Romantic boy! " answered Joseph ; "you would have

</p>
<p>false notions. There is perhaps neither damnation nor
</p>
<p>soul. If the dead returned to complain of their fate,
</p>
<p>I should have a thousand around me ; and I have never
</p>
<p>seen any even in my dreams."
</p>
<p>" Monster ! " muttered Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>" Words again ! " said Joseph ; " there is neither mon-
</p>
<p>ster nor virtuous man. You and De Thou, who pride
</p>
<p>yourselves on what you call virtue, you have failed in
</p>
<p>causing the death of perhaps a hundred thousand men
</p>
<p>at once and in the broad daylight for no end, while
</p>
<p>Richelieu and I have caused the death of far fewer, one
</p>
<p>by one, and by night, to found a great power. Would
</p>
<p>you remain pure and virtuous, you must not interfere
</p>
<p>with other men ; or rather, it is more reasonable to see
</p>
<p>that which is, and to say with me, it is possible that
</p>
<p>there is no such thing as a soul. We are the sons
</p>
<p>of chance ; but relative to other men, we have passions
</p>
<p>which we must satisfy."
</p>
<p>" I breathe again ! " exclaimed Cinq-Mars ; " he be-
</p>
<p>lieves not in God ! "
</p>
<p>Joseph continued,
</p>
<p>" Richelieu, you, and I were born ambitious ; it fol-
</p>
<p>lowed, then, that everything must be sacrificed to this
</p>
<p>idea."
</p>
<p>" Wretched man, do not compare me to thyself ! "
</p>
<p>" It is the plain truth, nevertheless," replied the
</p>
<p>Capuchin ; " only you now see that our system was
</p>
<p>better than yours."
</p>
<p>" Miserable wretch, it was for love "
</p>
<p>" No, no ! it was not that ; here are mere words

<p>again. You have perhaps imagined it was so ; but it
</p>
<p>220 CINQ-MARS,
</p>
<p>was for your own advancement. I have heard you
</p>
<p>speak to the young girl. You thought but of yourselves ;
</p>
<p>you do not love each other. She thought but of her
</p>
<p>rank, and you of your ambition. One loves in order to
</p>
<p>hear one's self called perfect, and to be adored ; it is still
</p>
<p>the same egoism."
</p>
<p>" Cruel serpent ! " cried Cinq-Mars ; " is it not enough
</p>
<p>that thou hast caused our deaths ? Why dost thou come
</p>
<p>here to cast thy venom upon the life thou hast taken
</p>
<p>from us ? What demon has suggested to thee thy
</p>
<p>horrible analysis of hearts ? "
</p>
<p>" Hatred of everything which is superior to myself,"
</p>
<p>replied Joseph, with a low and hollow laugh, " and the
</p>
<p>desire to crush those I hate under my feet, have made
</p>
<p>me ambitious and ingenious in finding the weakness of
</p>
<p>your dreams."
</p>
<p>" Just Heaven, dost thou hear him ? " exclaimed Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars, rising and extending his arms upwards.
</p>
<p>The solitude of his prison ; the pious conversations of
</p>
<p>his friend ; and, above all, the presence of death, which,
</p>
<p>like the light of an unknown star, paints in other colors
</p>
<p>the objects we are accustomed to see ; meditations on
</p>
<p>eternity ; and (shall we say it ?) the great efforts he had
</p>
<p>made to change his heart-rending regrets into immortal
</p>
<p>hopes, and to direct to God all that power of love which
</p>
<p>had led him astray upon earth, all this combined had
</p>
<p>worked a strange revolution in him ; and like those ears
</p>
<p>of corn which ripen suddenly on receiving one ray from
</p>
<p>the sun, his soul had acquired light, exalted by the
</p>
<p>mysterious influence of death.

<p>" Just Heaven ! " he repeated, " if this wretch and
</p>
<p>THE PRISONERS. 221
</p>
<p>his master are human, can I also be a man ? Behold,
</p>
<p>God, behold two distinct ambitions, the one egoisti-
</p>
<p>cal and bloody, the other devoted and unstained ; theirs
</p>
<p>roused by hatred, and ours inspired by love. Look
</p>
<p>down, Lord, judge, and pardon ! Pardon, for we have
</p>
<p>greatly erred in walking but for a single day in the
</p>
<p>same paths which, on earth, possess but one name to
</p>
<p>whatever end it may tend ! "
</p>
<p>Joseph interrupted him harshly, stamping his foot on
</p>
<p>the ground,
</p>
<p>" When you have finished your prayer," said he, " you
</p>
<p>will perhaps inform me whether you will assist me ; and
</p>
<p>1 will instantly -
</p>
<p>" Never, impure wretch, never ! " said Henri d'Effiat.
</p>
<p>"I will never unite with you in an assassination. I
</p>
<p>refused to do so when powerful, and upon yourself."
</p>
<p>" You were wrong ; you would have been master
</p>
<p>now."
</p>
<p>" And what happiness should I find in my power
</p>
<p>when shared as it must be by a woman who does not
</p>
<p>understand me ; who loved me feebly, and prefers a
</p>
<p>crown ? "
</p>
<p>" Inconceivable folly ! " said the Capuchin, laughing.
</p>
<p>" All with her ; nothing without her, that was my
</p>
<p>desire."
</p>
<p>" It is from obstinacy and vanity that you persist ;
</p>
<p>it is impossible," replied Joseph. " It is not in
</p>
<p>nature."
</p>
<p>" Thou who wouldst deny the spirit of self-sacrifice,"
</p>
<p>answered Cinq-Mars, " dost thou understand that of

</p>
<p>222 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" It does not exist ; he follows you because "
</p>
<p>Here the Capuchin, slightly embarrassed, reflected an
</p>
<p>instant.
</p>
<p>" Because because he has formed you ; you are
</p>
<p>his work ; he is attached to you by the self-love of an
</p>
<p>author. He was accustomed to lecture you ; and he felt
</p>
<p>that he should not find another pupil so docile to listen
</p>
<p>to and applaud him. Constant habit has persuaded him
</p>
<p>that his life was bound to yours ; it is something of
</p>
<p>that kind. He will accompany you mechanically. Be-
</p>
<p>sides, all is not yet finished ; we shall see the end and
</p>
<p>the examination. He will certainly deny all knowledge
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy."
</p>
<p>" He will not deny it ! " exclaimed Cinq-Mars, im-
</p>
<p>petuously.
</p>
<p>" He knew it, then ? You confess it," said Joseph,
</p>
<p>triumphantly ; " you have not said as much before."
</p>
<p>" Oh, heavens, what have I done ! " gasped Cinq-Mars,
</p>
<p>hiding his face.
</p>
<p>" Calm yourself ; he is saved, notwithstanding this
</p>
<p>avowal, if you accept my offer."
</p>
<p>D'Effiat remained silent for a short time.
</p>
<p>The Capuchin continued,
</p>
<p>" Save your friend. The king's favor awaits you, and
</p>
<p>perhaps the love which has erred for a moment."
</p>
<p>" Man, or whatever else thou art ! if thou hast in
</p>
<p>thee anything resembling a heart," answered the
</p>
<p>prisoner, " save him ! He is the purest of created
</p>
<p>beings ; but convey him far away while yet he

<p>sleeps, for should he awake, thy endeavors would be

</p>
<p>"What good would that do me?" said the Capuchin,
</p>
<p>laughing. " It is you and your favor that I want."
</p>
<p>The impetuous Cinq-Mars rose, and seizing Joseph by
</p>
<p>the arm, eying him with a terrible look, said,
</p>
<p>" I degraded him in interceding with thee for him."
</p>
<p>He continued, raising the tapestry which separated his
</p>
<p>apartment from that of his friend, " Come, and doubt,
</p>
<p>if thou canst, devotion and the immortality of the soul.
</p>
<p>Compare the uneasiness and misery of thy triumph with
</p>
<p>the calmness of our defeat, the meanness of thy reign
</p>
<p>with the grandeur of our captivity, thy sanguinary vigils
</p>
<p>to the slumbers of the just."
</p>
<p>A solitary lamp threw its light on De Thou. The
</p>
<p>young man was kneeling on a cushion, surmounted by a
</p>
<p>large ebony crucifix. He seemed to have fallen asleep
</p>
<p>while praying. His head, inclining backwards, was still
</p>
<p>raised towards the cross. His pale lips wore a calm
</p>
<p>and divine smile.
</p>
<p>" Holy Father, how he sleeps ! " exclaimed the aston-
</p>
<p>ished Capuchin, thoughtlessly uniting to his frightful
</p>
<p>discourse the sacred name he every day pronounced.
</p>
<p>He suddenly retired some paces, as if dazzled by a
</p>
<p>heavenly vision.
</p>
<p>" Nonsense, nonsense ! " he said, shaking his head,
</p>
<p>and passing his hand rapidly over his face. " All this
</p>
<p>is childishness. It would overcome me if I reflected
</p>
<p>on it. These ideas may serve as opium to produce
</p>
<p>a calm. But that is not the question ; say yes or
</p>
<p>no."

<p>gret having compromised De Thou, for he would not
</p>
<p>have bought his life at the price of an assassination.
</p>
<p>And when he yielded at Narbonne, it was not that he
</p>
<p>might escape at Lyons."
</p>
<p>" Then wake him, for here come the judges," said the
</p>
<p>furious Capuchin, in a sharp, piercing voice.
</p>
<p>Lighted by flambeaux, and preceded by a detachment
</p>
<p>of the Scotch guards, fourteen judges entered, wrapped
</p>
<p>in long robes, and whose features were not easily dis-
</p>
<p>tinguished. They seated themselves in silence on the
</p>
<p>right and left of the huge chamber. They were the
</p>
<p>judges delegated by the cardinal to judge this sad and
</p>
<p>solemn affair. All true men to the Cardinal Richelieu,
</p>
<p>and in his confidence, who from Tarascon had chosen
</p>
<p>and instructed them. He had the Chancellor Seguier
</p>
<p>brought to Lyons, to avoid, as he stated in the instruc-
</p>
<p>tions he sent by Chavigny to the King Louis XIIL,
</p>
<p>" to avoid all the delays which would take place if he were
</p>
<p>not present. M. de Marillac" he adds, " was at Nantes
</p>
<p>for the trial of Chalais, M. de Chateau-Neuf at Tou-
</p>
<p>louse, superintending the death of M. de Montmorency,
</p>
<p>and M. de Bellievre at Paris, conducting the trial of
</p>
<p>M. de Biron. The authority and intelligence of these
</p>
<p>gentlemen in forms of justice are indispensable."
</p>
<p>The chancellor arrived with all speed. But at this
</p>
<p>moment he was informed that he was not to appear, for
</p>
<p>fear that he might be influenced by the memory of his
</p>
<p>ancient friendship for the prisoner, whom he only saw
</p>
<p>tete-d-tSte. The commissioners and himself had pre-
</p>

</p>
<p>then at Vivey, 1 two miles from Lyons, where this
</p>
<p>wretched prince had received orders to go, begging for-
</p>
<p>giveness, and trembling, although surrounded by his
</p>
<p>followers, whom from very pity he had been allowed to
</p>
<p>retain, carefully watched, however, by the French and
</p>
<p>Swiss guards. The cardinal had dictated to him his
</p>
<p>part and answers word for word ; and in consideration
</p>
<p>of this docility, they had exempted him in form from
</p>
<p>the painful task of confronting MM. de Cinq-Mars and
</p>
<p>de Thou. 2 The chancellor and commissioners had also
</p>
<p>prepared M. de Bouillon, and strong with their prelimi-
</p>
<p>nary work, they visited in all their strength the two
</p>
<p>young criminals whom they had determined not to
</p>
<p>save.
</p>
<p>History has only handed down to us the names of the
</p>
<p>State counsellors who accompanied Pierre Seguier, but
</p>
<p>not those of the other commissioners, of whom it is only
</p>
<p>mentioned that there were six from the parliament of
</p>
<p>Grenoble, and two presidents. The counsellor, or re-
</p>
<p>porter of the State, Laubardemont, who had directed
</p>
<p>them in all, was at their head. Joseph often whispered
</p>
<p>to them with the most studied politeness, glancing at
</p>
<p>Laubardemont with a ferocious sneer.
</p>
<p>It was arranged that an armchair should serve as a
</p>
<p>bar ; and all were silent in expectation of the prisoner's
</p>
<p>answer.
</p>
<p>He spoke in a soft and clear voice,
</p>
<p>" Say to M. le Chancelier that I have the right of
</p>
<p>1 House which belonged to an Abbe' d'Esnay, brother of M. de Ville-
</p>
<p>roy, called Montresor.

<p>VOL. II. 15
</p>
<p>226 CINQ- MARS,
</p>
<p>appeal to the parliament of Paris, and to object to my
</p>
<p>judges, because two of them are my declared enemies,
</p>
<p>and at their head one of my friends, M. de Seguier him-
</p>
<p>self, whom I maintained in his charge.
</p>
<p>" But I will spare you much trouble, gentlemen, by
</p>
<p>pleading guilty to the whole charge of conspiracy, ar-
</p>
<p>ranged and conducted by myself alone. It is my wish
</p>
<p>to die. I have nothing to add for myself; but if you
</p>
<p>would be just, you will not harm the life of him whom
</p>
<p>the king has pronounced to be the most honest man in
</p>
<p>France, and who dies for my sake alone."
</p>
<p>" Summon him," said Laubardemont.
</p>
<p>Two guards entered the apartment of De Thou,
</p>
<p>and led him forth. He advanced, and bowed gravely,
</p>
<p>while an angelical smile played upon his lips. Embrac-
</p>
<p>ing Cinq-Mars, " Here at last is our day of glory,"
</p>
<p>said he. " We are about to gain heaven and eternal
</p>
<p>happiness."
</p>
<p>" We understand," said Laubardemont, " we have been
</p>
<p>given to understand by M. de Cinq-Mars himself that
</p>
<p>you were acquainted with this conspiracy ? "
</p>
<p>De Thou answered instantly, and without hesitation.
</p>
<p>A half-smile was still on his lips, and his eyes cast
</p>
<p>down.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, I have passed my life in studying human
</p>
<p>laws, and I know that the testimony of one accused per-
</p>

<p>myself. I have, however, well weighed the one and the
</p>
<p>THE PRISONERS. 227
</p>
<p>other. I have clearly foreseen that whatever life I may
</p>
<p>hereafter lead, it could not but be most unhappy after
</p>
<p>the loss of M. de Cinq-Mars. I therefore acknowledge
</p>
<p>and confess that I was aware of his conspiracy. I did
</p>
<p>my utmost to prevent it, to deter him from it. He be-
</p>
<p>lieved me to be his only and faithful friend, and I would
</p>
<p>not betray him. Therefore I condemn myself by the
</p>
<p>very laws which were set forth by my father, who, I
</p>
<p>hope, forgives me."
</p>
<p>At these words, the two friends precipitated them-
</p>
<p>selves into each other's arms.
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars exclaimed,
</p>
<p>" My friend, my friend, how bitterly I regret that I
</p>
<p>have caused your death ! Twice I have betrayed you ;
</p>
<p>but you shall know in what manner."
</p>
<p>But De Thou, embracing and consoling his friend, an-
</p>
<p>swered, raising his eyes from the ground,
</p>
<p>" Ah, happy are we to end our days in this manner !
</p>
<p>Humanly speaking, I might complain of you j but God
</p>
<p>knows how much I love you. What have we done to
</p>
<p>merit the grace of martyrdom, and the happiness of
</p>
<p>dying together?"
</p>
<p>The judges were not prepared for this mildness, and
</p>
<p>looked at each other with surprise.
</p>
<p>" If they would only give me a good partisan," mut-
</p>
<p>tered a hoarse voice (it was Grandchamp, who had crept
</p>
<p>into the room, and whose eyes were red with fury), " I
</p>
<p>would soon rid Monseigneur of all these black-looking
</p>
<p>fellows." Two men with halberds immediately placed
</p>
<p>themselves silently at his side. He said no more, and

<p>to compose himself retired to a window which over-
</p>
<p>228 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>looked the river, whose tranquil waters the sun had not
</p>
<p>yet lighted with its beams, and appeared to pay no at-
</p>
<p>tention to what was passing in the room.
</p>
<p>However, Laubardemont, fearing that the judges might
</p>
<p>be touched with compassion, said in a loud voice,
</p>
<p>" In pursuance of the order of Monseigneur the Car-
</p>
<p>dinal, these two men will be put to the rack ; that is to
</p>
<p>say, to the ordinary and extraordinaiy question."
</p>
<p>Indignation forced Cinq-Mars again to assume his
</p>
<p>natural character ; crossing his arms, he made two steps
</p>
<p>towards Laubardemont and Joseph, which alarmed
</p>
<p>them. The former involuntarily placed his hand to his
</p>
<p>forehead.
</p>
<p>" Are we at Loudun ? " exclaimed the prisoner ; but
</p>
<p>De Thou, advancing, took his hand and held it. Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars was silent, then continued in a calm voice, looking
</p>
<p>steadfastly at the judges,
</p>
<p>" Messieurs, this measure appears to me rather harsh ;
</p>
<p>a man of my age and rank ought not to be subjected to
</p>
<p>these formalities. I have confessed all, and I will con-
</p>
<p>fess it all again. I willingly and gladly accept death ;
</p>
<p>it is not from souls like ours that secrets can be wrung
</p>
<p>by bodily suffering. We are prisoners by our own free
</p>
<p>will, and at the time chosen by us. We have confessed
</p>
<p>enough for you to condemn us to death ; you shall know
</p>
<p>nothing more. We have obtained what we wanted."
</p>
<p>" What are you doing, my friend ? " interrupted De
</p>
<p>Thou. " He is mistaken, gentlemen, we do not refuse
</p>
<p>this martyrdom which God offers us ; we demand it."
</p>
<p>" But," said Cinq-Mars, " do you need such infamous

<p>tortures to obtain salvation, you who are already a
</p>
<p>THE PRISONERS. 229
</p>
<p>martyr, a voluntary martyr to friendship ? Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>it is I alone who possess important secrets ; it is the
</p>
<p>chief of a conspiracy who knows all. Put me alone to
</p>
<p>the torture if we must be treated like the worst of
</p>
<p>malefactors."
</p>
<p>" For the sake of charity," added De Thou, " deprive
</p>
<p>me not of equal suffering with my friend ; I have not
</p>
<p>followed him so far, to abandon him at this dreadful
</p>
<p>moment, and not to use every effort to accompany him
</p>
<p>to heaven."
</p>
<p>During this debate, another was going forward be-
</p>
<p>tween Laubardemont and Joseph. The latter, fearing
</p>
<p>that torments would induce him to disclose the secret
</p>
<p>of his recent proposition, advised that they should not
</p>
<p>be resorted to ; the other, not thinking his triumph com-
</p>
<p>plete by death alone, absolutely insisted on their being
</p>
<p>applied. The judges surrounded and listened to these
</p>
<p>secret agents of the prime minister; however, many
</p>
<p>circumstances having caused them to suspect that the
</p>
<p>influence of the Capuchin was more powerful than that
</p>
<p>of the judge, they took part with him, and decided for
</p>
<p>mercy, when he finished by these words uttered in a low
</p>
<p>voice,
</p>
<p>" I know their secrets. There is no necessity to force
</p>
<p>them from their lips, because they are useless, and relate
</p>
<p>to too high circumstances. M. le Grand has no one to
</p>
<p>denounce but the king, and the other the queen. It is
</p>
<p>better that we should remain ignorant. Besides, they
</p>
<p>will not confess. I know them; they will be silent,
</p>
<p>the one from pride, the other through piety. Let them

</p>
<p>ured and unable to walk. That will spoil the whole
</p>
<p>ceremony ; they must be kept to appear."
</p>
<p>This last observation prevailed. The judges retired to
</p>
<p>deliberate with the chancellor. While departing, Joseph
</p>
<p>whispered to Laubardemont,
</p>
<p>" I have provided you with enough pleasure here ;
</p>
<p>you will still have that of deliberating, and then you
</p>
<p>shall go and examine three men who are confined in
</p>
<p>the northern tower."
</p>
<p>These were the three judges who had condemned
</p>
<p>Urbain Grandier.
</p>
<p>As he spoke, he laughed heartily, and was the last to
</p>
<p>leave the room, pushing the astonished master of requests
</p>
<p>before him.
</p>
<p>The sombre tribunal had scarcely disappeared when
</p>
<p>Grandchamp, relieved from his two guards, hastened
</p>
<p>towards his master, and seizing his hand, said,
</p>
<p>" In the name of Heaven, come to the terrace, Mon-
</p>
<p>seigneur ! I have something to show you ; in the name
</p>
<p>of your mother, come ! "
</p>
<p>But at that moment the chamber door was opened,
</p>
<p>and the old Abb Quillet appeared.
</p>
<p>" My children ! my dear children ! " exclaimed the old
</p>
<p>man, weeping bitterly. " Alas ! why was I only per-
</p>
<p>mitted to enter to-day ? Dear Henri, your mother, your
</p>
<p>brother, your sister, are concealed here."
</p>
<p>" Be quiet, M. 1' Abbe* ! " said Grandchamp ; " do come
</p>
<p>to the terrace, Monseigneur."
</p>
<p>But the old priest still detained and embraced his
</p>
<p>pupil.

</p>
<p>" I shall refuse it," said Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>" We hope for nothing but the mercy of God," added
</p>
<p>De Thou.
</p>
<p>" Silence ! " said Grandchamp, " the judges are
</p>
<p>returning."
</p>
<p>And the door opened again to admit the dismal pro-
</p>
<p>cession, from which Joseph and Laubardemont were
</p>
<p>missing.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen," exclaimed the good abbe, addressing
</p>
<p>the commissioners, " I am happy to tell you that I have
</p>
<p>just arrived from Paris, and that no one doubts but that
</p>
<p>all the conspirators will be pardoned. I have had an
</p>
<p>interview at her Majesty's apartments with Monsieur
</p>
<p>himself ; and as to the Due de Bouillon, his examination
</p>
<p>is not unfav
</p>
<p>" Silence ! " cried M. de Seyton, the lieutenant of the
</p>
<p>Scotch guards ; and the commissioners entered and
</p>
<p>again arranged themselves in the apartment.
</p>
<p>M. de Thou, hearing them summon the criminal
</p>
<p>recorder of the presidial of Lyons to pronounce the
</p>
<p>sentence, involuntarily launched out in one of those
</p>
<p>transports of religious joy which are never displayed
</p>
<p>but by the martyrs and saints at the approach of death ;
</p>
<p>and advancing towards this man, he exclaimed,
</p>
<p>" Quam speciosi pedes evangelizantium pacem, evan-
</p>
<p>gelizantium bona ! "
</p>
<p>Then, taking the hand of Cinq-Mars, he knelt down
</p>
<p>bareheaded to receive the sentence, as was the custom.
</p>
<p>D'Effiat remained standing ; and they dared not compel
</p>
<p>him to kneel. The sentence was pronounced in these

</p>

<p>informations, interrogations, confessions, denegations, and

<p>confrontations, and authenticated copies of the treaty with
</p>
<p>Spain, it is considered in the delegated chamber:
</p>
<p>" (1) That he who conspires against the person of the
</p>
<p>ministers of princes is considered by the ancient laws and
</p>
<p>constitutions of the emperors to be guilt}' of high treason ;
</p>
<p>(2) That the third ordinance of the King Louis XI. renders
</p>
<p>any one liable to the punishment of death who does not
</p>
<p>reveal a conspiracy against the State.
</p>
<p>" The commissioners deputed by his Majest}' have de-
</p>
<p>clared the said D'Effiat and De Thou guilty and convicted

<p>of the crime of high treason :

<p>" The said D'Effiat, for the conspiracies and enterprises,

<p>league, and treaties, formed by him with the foreigner

<p>against the State ;

<p>of this conspiracy.

<p>" In reparation of which crimes, they have deprived them

<p>of all honors and dignities, and condemned them to be de-

<p>erected in the Place des Terreaux, in this city.

<p>to it again, of the aforesaid goods, sixty thousand livres

<p>being devoted to pious uses."
</p>
<p>THE PRISONERS. 233
</p>
<p>After the sentence was pronounced, M. de Thou ex-
</p>
<p>claimed in a loud voice,
</p>
<p>" God be blessed ! God be praised ! "
</p>
<p>" I have never feared death," said Cinq-Mars, coldly.
</p>
<p>Then, according to the forms prescribed, M. Seyton,
</p>
<p>the lieutenant of the Scotch guards, an old man up-
</p>
<p>wards of sixty years of age, declared with emotion
</p>
<p>that he placed the prisoners in the hands of the Sieur
</p>
<p>Thome*, provost of the merchants of Lyons; he then
</p>
<p>took leave of them, followed by the whole of the
</p>
<p>body-guard, silently, and in tears.
</p>
<p>" Weep not," said Cinq-Mars ; " tears are useless.
</p>
<p>Rather pray for us ; and be assured that I do not fear
</p>
<p>death."
</p>
<p>He shook them by the hand, and De Thou embraced
</p>
<p>them ; after which, they left the apartment, their
</p>
<p>eyes filled with tears, and hiding their faces in their
</p>
<p>cloaks.
</p>
<p>" Barbarians ! " exclaimed the Abbe* Quillet ; " to
</p>
<p>find arms against them, one must search the whole
</p>
<p>arsenal of tyrants. Why did they admit me at this
</p>
<p>moment ? "
</p>
<p>"As a confessor, sir," whispered one of the commis-
</p>
<p>sioners ; " for no stranger has entered this place these
</p>
<p>two months."
</p>
<p>As soon as the huge gates of the prison were closed,
</p>
<p>and the outside gratings lowered, " To the terrace, in
</p>
<p>the name of Heaven ! " again exclaimed Grandchamp.

</p>
<p>And he drew his master and De Thou thither.
</p>
<p>234 CINQ-MARS,
</p>
<p>The old preceptor followed them, weeping.
</p>
<p>" What do you want with us in a moment like this ? "
</p>
<p>said Cinq-Mars, with an indulgent gravity.
</p>
<p>" Look at the chains of the town," said the faithful
</p>
<p>servant.
</p>
<p>The rising sun had hardly tinged the sky. In the
</p>
<p>horizon a line of vivid yellow was visible, upon which
</p>
<p>the mountain's rough blue outlines were boldly traced ;
</p>
<p>the waves of the Saone, and the chains of the town,
</p>
<p>hanging from one bank to the other, were still veiled by
</p>
<p>a light vapor, which also rose from Lyons and concealed
</p>
<p>the roofs of the houses from the eye of the spectator.
</p>
<p>The first tints of the morning light had as yet colored
</p>
<p>only the most elevated points of the magnificent land-
</p>
<p>scape. In the city the steeples of the H6tel de Ville
</p>
<p>and St. Nizier, and on the surrounding hills, the monas-
</p>
<p>teries of the Carmelites and Ste. Marie, and the entire
</p>
<p>fortress of Pierre-Encise, were gilded with the fires of
</p>
<p>the coming day. The joyful peals from the churches
</p>
<p>were heard, the peaceful matins from the convent and
</p>
<p>village bells. The walls of the prison were alone
</p>
<p>silent.
</p>
<p>" Well," said Cinq-Mars, " what are we to see, the
</p>
<p>beauty of the plains, the richness of the city, or the
</p>
<p>calm peacefulness of these villages ? Ah, my friend, in
</p>
<p>every place there are to be found passions and griefs,
</p>
<p>like those which have brought us here."
</p>
<p>The old abbe" and Grandchamp leaned over the para-
</p>
<p>pet, watching the bank of the river.
</p>
<p>"The fog is so thick, we can see nothing yet," said

<p>the abbe".
</p>
<p>THE PRISONERS. 235
</p>
<p>" How slowly our last sun appears ! " said De Thou.
</p>
<p>" Do you not see low down there, at the foot of the
</p>
<p>rocks on the opposite bank, a small white house,
</p>
<p>between the Halincourt gate and the Boulevard St.
</p>
<p>Jean?" asked the abbe*.
</p>
<p>" I see nothing," answered Cinq-Mars, " but a mass
</p>
<p>of dreary wall."
</p>
<p>" Hark ! " said the abbe* ; " some one speaks near
</p>
<p>us!"
</p>
<p>In fact, a confused, low, and inexplicable murmur
</p>
<p>was heard in a little turret, the back of which rested
</p>
<p>upon the platform of the terrace. As it was scarcely
</p>
<p>larger than a pigeon-house, the prisoners had not until
</p>
<p>now observed it.
</p>
<p>" Are they already coming to fetch us ? " said Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars.
</p>
<p>" Bah ! bah ! " answered Grandchamp, " do not make
</p>
<p>yourself uneasy ; it is the Tour des Oubliettes. I have
</p>
<p>prowled round the fort for two months, and I have seen
</p>
<p>men fall from there into the water at least once a week.
</p>
<p>Let us think of our affair. I see a light down there."
</p>
<p>An invincible curiosity, however, led the two prisoners
</p>
<p>to look at the turret, in spite of the horror of their own
</p>
<p>situation. It advanced to the extremity of the rock,
</p>
<p>over a gulf of foaming green water of great depth. A
</p>
<p>wheel of a mill long deserted was seen turning with
</p>
<p>great rapidity. Three distinct sounds were now heard,
</p>
<p>like those of a drawbridge suddenly lowered and raised
</p>
<p>to its former position by a recoil or spring striking
</p>
<p>against the stone walls ; and three times a black sub-

<p>stance was seen to fall into the water with a splash.
</p>
<p>236 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>" Mercy ! can these be men ? " exclaimed the abbe",
</p>
<p>crossing himself.
</p>
<p>" I thought I saw brown robes turning in the air,"
</p>
<p>said Grandchamp ; " they are the cardinal's friends."
</p>
<p>A horrible cry was heard from the tower, accom-
</p>
<p>panied by an impious oath. The heavy trap groaned
</p>
<p>for the fourth time. The green water received with a
</p>
<p>loud noise a burden which cracked the enormous wheel
</p>
<p>of the mill ; one of its large spokes was torn away, and
</p>
<p>a man entangled in its beams appeared above the foam
</p>
<p>which he colored with his blood. He rose twice, and
</p>
<p>sank beneath the waters, shrieking violently ; it was
</p>
<p>Laubardemont.
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars drew back in horror.
</p>
<p>" There is a Providence," said Grandchamp ; " Urbain
</p>
<p>Grandier summoned him in three years. But come,
</p>
<p>come ! the time is precious ! Do not remain motionless.
</p>
<p>Be it he, I am not surprised, for those wretches devour
</p>
<p>each other. But let us endeavor to deprive them of
</p>
<p>their choicest morsel. Vive Dieu! I see the signal ! We
</p>
<p>are saved ! All is ready ; run to this side, M. 1'Abbd !
</p>
<p>See the white handkerchief at the window ! our friends
</p>
<p>are prepared."
</p>
<p>The abbe* seized the hands of both his friends, and
</p>
<p>drew them to that side of the terrace towards which
</p>
<p>they had at first looked. " Listen to me, both of you,"
</p>
<p>said he. "You must know that none of the conspira-
</p>
<p>tors have profited by the retreat you secured for them.
</p>
<p>They have all hastened to Lyons, disguised and in great
</p>
<p>number ; they have distributed sufficient gold in the city

<p>to secure them from being betraved ; thev are resolved

</p>
<p>to make an attempt to deliver you. The time chosen is
</p>
<p>that when they are conducting you to the scaffold ; the
</p>
<p>signal is your hat, which you will place on your head
</p>
<p>when they are to commence."
</p>
<p>The worthy abbe*, half weeping, half smiling hopefully,
</p>
<p>related that upon the arrest of his pupil, he had has-
</p>
<p>tened to Paris ; that such secrepy enveloped all the car-
</p>
<p>dinal's actions that none there knew the place in which
</p>
<p>the master of the horse was detained. Many said that
</p>
<p>he was banished ; and when the reconciliation between
</p>
<p>Monsieur and the Due de Bouillon and the king was
</p>
<p>known, men no longer doubted that the life of the other
</p>
<p>was assured, and ceased to speak of this affair, which,
</p>
<p>not having been executed, compromised few persons.
</p>
<p>They had even in some measure rejoiced in Paris to
</p>
<p>see the town of Sedan and its territory added to the
</p>
<p>kingdom in exchange for the letters of abolition granted
</p>
<p>to the due, acknowledged innocent in common with
</p>
<p>Monsieur ; so that the result of all the arrangements
</p>
<p>had been to excite admiration of the cardinal's ability,
</p>
<p>and of his clemency towards the conspirators, who, it
</p>
<p>was said, had contemplated his death. They even
</p>
<p>spread the report that he had facilitated the escape of
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars and De Thou, occupying himself generously
</p>
<p>with their retreat to a foreign land, after having bravely
</p>
<p>caused them to be arrested in the midst of the camp
</p>
<p>of Perpignan.
</p>
<p>At this part of the narrative, Cinq-Mars could not
</p>
<p>avoid forgetting his resignation, and clasping his
</p>
<p>friend's hand, "Arrested!" he exclaimed. "Must we

</p>
<p>dered ourselves ? Must we sacrifice all, even the opinion
</p>
<p>of posterity ? "
</p>
<p>"There is vanity again," replied De Thou, placing his
</p>
<p>fingers on his lips. " But hush ! let us hear the abbe
</p>
<p>to the end."
</p>
<p>The tutor, not doubting that the calmness which these
</p>
<p>two young men exhibited arose from the joy they felt
</p>
<p>in finding their escape assured, and seeing that the sun
</p>
<p>had hardly yet dispersed the morning mists, yielded
</p>
<p>himself without restraint to the involuntary pleasure
</p>
<p>which old men always feel in recounting new events,
</p>
<p>even though they afflict the hearers. He related all
</p>
<p>his fruitless endeavors to discover his pupil's retreat,
</p>
<p>unknown to the court and the town, where none, indeed,
</p>
<p>dared to pronounce the name of Cinq-Mars in the most
</p>
<p>secret asylums. He had only heard of the imprison-
</p>
<p>ment at Pierre-Encise from the queen herself, who had
</p>
<p>deigned to send for him, and charge him to inform
</p>
<p>the Marechale d'Effiat and all the conspirators that they
</p>
<p>might make a desperate effort to deliver their young
</p>
<p>chief. Anne of Austria had even ventured to send
</p>
<p>many of the gentlemen of Auvergne and Touraine to
</p>
<p>Lyons to assist in their last attempt.
</p>
<p>" The good queen ! " said he ; " she wept greatly when
</p>
<p>I saw her, and said that she would give all she pos-
</p>
<p>sessed to save you. She reproached herself deeply for
</p>
<p>some letter, I know not what. She spoke of the welfare
</p>
<p>of France, but did not explain herself. She said that
</p>
<p>she admired you, and conjured you to save yourself,
</p>
<p>if it were only through pity for her, whom you would

</p>
<p>"Said she nothing else?" interrupted De Thou, sup-
</p>
<p>porting Cinq-Mars, who grew visibly paler.
</p>
<p>" Nothing more," said the old man.
</p>
<p>" And no one else spoke of me ? " inquired the master
</p>
<p>of the horse.
</p>
<p>" No one," said the abbe*.
</p>
<p>" If she had but written to me ! " murmured Henri.
</p>
<p>" Remember, my father, that you were sent here us
</p>
<p>a confessor," said De Thou.
</p>
<p>Here old Grandchamp, who had been kneeling before
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars, and dragging him by his clothes to the other
</p>
<p>side of the terrace, exclaimed in a broken voice,
</p>
<p>" Monseigneur my master my good master do
</p>
<p>you see them ? Look there 't is they ! 't is they
</p>
<p>all of them ! "
</p>
<p>" Who, my old friend ?" asked his master.
</p>
<p>" Who ? Great Heaven ! look at that window ! Do
</p>
<p>you not recognize them ? Your mother, your sisters,
</p>
<p>and your brother."
</p>
<p>And the day, now fairly broken, showed him in the
</p>
<p>distance several women waving their handkerchiefs ; and
</p>
<p>there, dressed all in black, stretching out her arms
</p>
<p>towards the prison, sustained by those about her, Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars recognized his mother, with his family, and his
</p>
<p>strength failed him for a moment. He leaned his head
</p>
<p>upon his friend's breast and wept.
</p>
<p>" How many times must I, then, die ? " he murmured ;
</p>
<p>then, with a gesture, returning from the top of the
</p>
<p>tower the salutations of his family, " Let us descend
</p>
<p>quickly, my father!" he said to the old abbe". "You

<p>will tell me at the tribunal of penitence, and before
</p>
<p>240 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>God, whether the remainder of my life is worth my
</p>
<p>shedding more blood to preserve it."
</p>
<p>It was there that Cinq-Mars confessed to God what
</p>
<p>he alone and Marie de Mantua knew of their secret and
</p>
<p>unfortunate love. " He gave to his confessor," says
</p>
<p>Father Daniel, " a portrait of a noble lady set in dia-
</p>
<p>monds, which were to be sold, and the money employed
</p>
<p>in pious works."
</p>
<p>M. de Thou, after having confessed, wrote a letter ; 1
</p>
<p>after which (according to the account given by his
</p>
<p>confessor) he said, " This is the last thought I will
</p>
<p>bestow upon this world ; let us depart for heaven ! "
</p>
<p>and walking up and down the room with long strides,
</p>
<p>he recited aloud the psalm, Miserere mei Deus, with an
</p>
<p>incredible ardor of spirit, his whole frame trembling so
</p>
<p>violently it seemed as if he did not touch the earth, and
</p>
<p>that the soul was about to make its exit from his body.
</p>
<p>The guards were mute at this spectacle, which made
</p>
<p>them all shudder with respect and horror.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile all was calm in the city of Lyons, when
</p>
<p>to the great astonishment of its inhabitants, they beheld
</p>
<p>the entrance through all its gates of troops of infantry
</p>
<p>and cavalry, which they knew were encamped at a great
</p>
<p>distance. The French and the Swiss guards, the regi-
</p>
<p>ment of Pompadours, the men-at-arms of Maurevert,
</p>
<p>and the carabineers of La Roque, all defiled in silence.

<p>saddle, silently drew up round the cMteau of Pierre-
</p>
<p>Encise ; the infantry formed a line upon the banks of
</p>
<p>the Saone from the gate of the fortress to the Place
</p>
<p>des Terreaux. It was the usual spot for execution.
</p>
<p>" Four companies of the bourgeois of Lyons, called pen-
</p>
<p>nonage, of about eleven or twelve hundred men, were ranged
</p>
<p>[sa3 r s the journal of Montresor] in the midst of the Place
</p>
<p>des Terreaux, so as to enclose a space of about eighty paces
</p>
<p>each wa}', into which they admitted no one but those who
</p>
<p>were absolutely necessary.
</p>
<p>' ' In the centre of this space was raised a scaffold about
</p>
<p>seven feet high and nine feet square, in the midst of which,
</p>
<p>somewhat forward, was placed a stake three feet in height,
</p>
<p>in front of which was a block half a foot high, so that the
</p>
<p>principal face of the scaffold looked towards the shambles of
</p>
<p>the Terreaux, by the side of the Saone. Against the scaffold
</p>
<p>was placed a short ladder of eight rounds, in the direction of
</p>
<p>the Dames de St. Pierre."
</p>
<p>Nothing had transpired in the town as to the name of
</p>
<p>the prisoners. The inaccessible walls of the fortress let
</p>
<p>none enter or leave but at night, and the deep dungeons
</p>
<p>had sometimes confined father and son for years to-
</p>
<p>gether, four feet apart from each other, without their
</p>
<p>even being aware of the vicinity. The surprise was
</p>
<p>extreme at these striking preparations, and the crowd
</p>
<p>collected, not knowing whether for a fete or for an
</p>
<p>execution.
</p>
<p>This same secrecy which the agents of the minister
</p>
<p>had strictly preserved was also carefully adhered to by
</p>
<p>the conspirators, for their heads depended on it.

<p>242 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>vocate Fournier, disguised as soldiers, workmen, and
</p>
<p>morris-dancers, armed with poniards under their clothes,
</p>
<p>had dispersed amid the crowd more than five hundred
</p>
<p>gentlemen and domestics, disguised like themselves.
</p>
<p>Horses were ready on the road to Italy, and boats upon
</p>
<p>the Rhone had been previously engaged. The young
</p>
<p>Marquis d'Effiat, elder brother of Cinq-Mars, dressed as
</p>
<p>a Carthusian, traversed the crowd without ceasing be-
</p>
<p>tween the Place des Terreaux and the little house in
</p>
<p>which his mother and sister were concealed with the
</p>
<p>Presidente de Pontac, the sister of the unfortunate De
</p>
<p>Thou. He reassured them, gave them from time to
</p>
<p>time a ray of hope, and returned to the conspirators to
</p>
<p>satisfy himself that each was prepared for action.
</p>
<p>Each soldier forming the line had at his side a man
</p>
<p>ready to poniard him.
</p>
<p>The vast crowd, heaped together behind the line of
</p>
<p>guards, pushed them forward, passed their lines, and
</p>
<p>made them lose ground. Ambrosio, the Spanish ser-
</p>
<p>vant whom Cinq-Mars had saved, had taken charge of
</p>
<p>the captain of the pikemen, and, disguised as a Catalo-
</p>
<p>nian musician, had commenced a dispute with him, pre-
</p>
<p>tending to be determined not to cease playing the hurdy-
</p>
<p>gurdy.
</p>
<p>Every one was at his post.
</p>
<p>The Abbe* de Gondi, Olivier d'Entraigues, and the
</p>
<p>Marquis d'Effiat, were in the midst of a group of fish-
</p>
<p>women and oyster-wenches, who were disputing and
</p>
<p>bawling, abusing one of their number younger and more
</p>
<p>timid than her masculine companions. The brother of

<p>Cinq-Mars approached to listen to their quarrel.

</p>
<p>"And why," said she to the others, "would you
</p>
<p>have Jean le Roux, who is an honest man, cut off
</p>
<p>the heads of two Christians, because he is a butcher
</p>
<p>by trade ? So long as I am his wife, I '11 not allow it.
</p>
<p>I'd rather"
</p>
<p>" Well, you are wrong ! " replied her companions.
</p>
<p>" What is 't to thee whether the meat he* cuts is eaten
</p>
<p>or not eaten ? Why, thou 'It have a hundred crowns to
</p>
<p>dress thy three children all in new clothes. Thou'rt
</p>
<p>lucky to be the wife of a butcher. Profit, then, ma
</p>
<p>mignonne, by what God sends thee by the favor of his
</p>
<p>Eminence."
</p>
<p>" Let me alone ! " answered the first speaker. " I '11
</p>
<p>not accept it. I 've seen these fine young gentlemen at
</p>
<p>the windows. They look as mild as lambs."
</p>
<p>" Well ! and are not thy lambs and calves killed ? "
</p>
<p>said Femme le Bon. " What fortune falls to this little
</p>
<p>woman ! What a pity ! especially when it is from the
</p>
<p>reverend Capuchin ! "
</p>
<p>" How horrible is the gayety of the people ! " said
</p>
<p>Olivier d'Entraigues, unguardedly. All the women
</p>
<p>heard him, and began to murmur against him.
</p>
<p>" Of the people ! " said they ; " and whence comes this
</p>
<p>little bricklayer with his plastered clothes ? "
</p>
<p>" Ah ! " interrupted another, " dost not see that 't is
</p>
<p>some gentleman in disguise ? Look at his white hands !
</p>
<p>He never worked a square ; 't is some little dandy con-
</p>
<p>spirator. I 've a great mind to go and fetch the captain
</p>
<p>of the watch to arrest him."

</p>
<p>244 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>Olivier, and assuming the manners of a joiner, whose
</p>
<p>costume and apron he had adopted, he exclaimed, seiz-
</p>
<p>ing him by the collar,
</p>
<p>" You 're just right. 'T is a little rascal that never
</p>
<p>works ! These two years that my father 's apprenticed
</p>
<p>him, he has done nothing hut comb his hair to please
</p>
<p>the girls. Come, get home with you ! "
</p>
<p>And striking him with his rule, he drove him through
</p>
<p>the crowd, and returned to place himself on another
</p>
<p>part of the line. After having well reprimanded the
</p>
<p>thoughtless page, he asked him for the letter which he
</p>
<p>said he had to give to M. de Cinq-Mars when he should
</p>
<p>have escaped. Olivier had carried it in his pocket for two
</p>
<p>months. He gave it him. " It is from one prisoner to
</p>
<p>another," said he, " for the Chevalier de Jars, on leav-
</p>
<p>ing the Bastille, sent it me from one of his companions
</p>
<p>in captivity."
</p>
<p>" Mafoi!" said Gondi, "there may be some impor-
</p>
<p>tant secret in it for our friends. I'll open it. You
</p>
<p>ought to have thought of it before. Ah, bah ! it is from
</p>
<p>old Bassompierre. Let us read it.
</p>
<p>" MY DEAR CHILD, I learn from the depths of the Bas-
</p>
<p>tille, where I still remain, that you are conspiring against the
</p>
<p>tyrant Richelieu, who does not cease to humiliate our good
</p>
<p>old nobility and the parliaments, and to sap the foundations
</p>
<p>of the edifice upon which the State reposes. I hear that the
</p>
<p>nobles are taxed and condemned by petty judges, contrary
</p>
<p>to the privileges of their condition, forced to the arriere-ban,
</p>
<p>despite the ancient customs."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! the old dotard ! " interrupted the page, laugh-

</p>
<p>" Not so foolish as you imagine, only he is a little be-
</p>
<p>hindhand for our affair.
</p>
<p>" I cannot but approve this generous project, and I pray
</p>
<p>you give me to wot all your proceedings "
</p>
<p>" Ah ! the old language of the last reign ! " said
</p>
<p>Olivier. " He can't say, ' Make me acquainted with
</p>
<p>your proceedings,' as we now say."
</p>
<p>" Let me read, for Heaven's sake ! " said the abbe* ; " a
</p>
<p>hundred years hence they '11 laugh at our phrases." He
</p>
<p>continued,
</p>
<p>" I can counsel you, notwithstanding my great age, in re-
</p>
<p>lating to you what happened to me in 1560.
</p>
<p>" Ah, faith ! I 've not time to waste in reading it all.
</p>
<p>Let us see the end.
</p>
<p>" When I remember my dining at the house of Madame
</p>
<p>la Marechale d'Effiat, your mother, and ask mj'self what has
</p>
<p>become of all the guests, I am really afflicted. My poor Pu}--
</p>
<p>Laurens has died at Vincennes, of grief at being forgotten
</p>
<p>by Monsieur in his prison ; De Launay killed in a duel, and
</p>
<p>I am grieved at it, for although I was little satisfied with my
</p>
<p>arrest, he did it with courtesy, and I have alwa} r s thought
</p>
<p>him a gentleman. As for me, I am under lock and key until
</p>
<p>the death of M. le Cardinal. Ah, my child ! we were thir-
</p>
<p>teen at table. We must not laugh at old superstitions.
</p>
<p>Thank God that you are the only one to whom evil has not
</p>
<p>arrived ! "
</p>
<p>" There again ! " said Olivier, laughing heartily ; and
</p>
<p>this time the Abbe* de Gondi could not maintain his
</p>
<p>gravity, despite all his efforts.

<p>They tore the useless letter to pieces, that it might

</p>
<p>not prolong the detention of the old mare'chal, should it
</p>
<p>be found, and drew near the Place des Terreaux and
</p>
<p>the line of guards, whom they were to attack when
</p>
<p>the signal of the hat should be given by the young
</p>
<p>prisoner.
</p>
<p>They beheld with satisfaction all their friends at their
</p>
<p>post, and ready to " play with their knives," to use their
</p>
<p>own expression. The people, pressing around them,
</p>
<p>favored them without being aware of it. There came
</p>
<p>near the abbe* a troop of young ladies, dressed in white
</p>
<p>and veiled. They were going to church to communi-
</p>
<p>cate ; and the nuns who conducted them, thinking, like
</p>
<p>most of the people, that the preparations were intended
</p>
<p>to do honor to some great personage, allowed them to
</p>
<p>mount upon some large hewn stones, collected behind
</p>
<p>the soldiers. There they grouped themselves with the
</p>
<p>grace natural to their age, like twenty beautiful statues
</p>
<p>upon a single pedestal. One would have taken them
</p>
<p>for those vestals whom antiquity invited to the san-
</p>
<p>guinary shows of the gladiators. They whispered to each
</p>
<p>other, looking around them, laughing and blushing to-
</p>
<p>gether like children.
</p>
<p>The Abb6 de Gondi saw with impatience that Olivier
</p>
<p>was again forgetting his character of conspirator and his
</p>
<p>costume of a bricklayer, in ogling these girls, and assum-
</p>
<p>ing a mien too elegant, an attitude too refined, for the
</p>
<p>position in life he was supposed to occupy. He already
</p>
<p>began to approach them, turning his hair with his fingers,
</p>
<p>when Fontrailles and Montre'sor fortunately arrived in
</p>
<p>the dress of Swiss soldiers. A group of gentlemen, dis-

</p>
<p>their hands. There was a paleness on their faces which
</p>
<p>announced no good.
</p>
<p>" Stop here ! " said one of them to his suite ; " this is
</p>
<p>the place."
</p>
<p>The sombre air and the silence of these spectators
</p>
<p>contrasted with the gay and anxious looks of the girls,
</p>
<p>and their childish exclamations.
</p>
<p>" Ah, the fine procession ! " they cried ; " there are
</p>
<p>at least five hundred men with cuirasses and red uni-
</p>
<p>forms, upon fine horses. They 've got yellow feathers in
</p>
<p>their large hats."
</p>
<p>" They are strangers, Catalonians," said a French
</p>
<p>guard.
</p>
<p>" Whom are they conducting here ? Ah, here is a
</p>
<p>fine gilt coach ! but there 's no one in it."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! I see three men on foot ; where are they
</p>
<p>going?"
</p>
<p>" To death ! " said Fontrailles, in a deep, stern voice
</p>
<p>which silenced all around. Nothing was heard but the
</p>
<p>slow tramp of the horses, which suddenly stopped, from
</p>
<p>one of those delays that happen in all processions.
</p>
<p>They then beheld a painful and singular spectacle. An
</p>
<p>old man with a tonsured head walked with difficulty,
</p>
<p>sobbing violently, supported by two young men of inter-
</p>
<p>esting and engaging appearance, who held one of each
</p>
<p>other's hands behind his bent shoulders, while with
</p>
<p>the other hand each held one of his arms. The one on
</p>
<p>the left was dressed in black ; he was grave, and his
</p>
<p>eyes were cast down. The other, much younger, was
</p>
<p>attired in a striking dress. 1 A pourpoint of Holland

<p>cloth, adorned with broad gold lace, and with large
</p>
<p>embroidered sleeves, covered him from the neck to the
</p>
<p>waist, somewhat in the fashion of a woman's corset;
</p>
<p>the rest of his vestments were in black velvet, embroid-
</p>
<p>ered with silver palms. Gray boots with red heels, to
</p>
<p>which were attached golden spurs ; a scarlet cloak with
</p>
<p>gold buttons, all set off to advantage his elegant and
</p>
<p>graceful figure. He bowed right and left with a melan-
</p>
<p>choly smile.
</p>
<p>An old servant, with white mustaches and beard, fol-
</p>
<p>lowed with his head bent down, leading two chargers,
</p>
<p>richly caparisoned. The young ladies were silent ; but
</p>
<p>they could not restrain their sobs.
</p>
<p>" It is, then, that poor old man whom they are lead-
</p>
<p>ing to the scaffold," they exclaimed ; " and his children
</p>
<p>are supporting him."
</p>
<p>" Upon your knees, ladies," said a man, " and pray
</p>
<p>for him!"
</p>
<p>" On your knees," cried Gondi, " and let us pray that
</p>
<p>God will deliver him ! "
</p>
<p>All the conspirators repeated, " On your knees ! on
</p>
<p>your knees ! " and set the example to the people, who
</p>
<p>imitated them in silence.
</p>
<p>" We can see his movements better now," said Gondi,
</p>
<p>in a whisper to Montr^sor. " Stand up ; what is he
</p>
<p>doing?"
</p>
<p>" He has stopped, and is speaking on our side, salut-
</p>
<p>ing us ; I think he has recognized us."
</p>
<p>Every house, window, wall, roof, and raised platform
</p>
<p>that looked upon the place, was filled with persons of

<p>THE PRISONERS. 249
</p>
<p>The most profound silence prevailed throughout the
</p>
<p>immense multitude. One might have heard the wings of
</p>
<p>a gnat, the breath of the slightest wind, the passage of
</p>
<p>the grains of dust which it raised ; yet the air was calm,
</p>
<p>the sun brilliant, the sky blue. The people listened
</p>
<p>attentively. They were close to the Place des Terreaux ;
</p>
<p>they heard the blows of the hammer upon the planks,
</p>
<p>then the voice of Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>A young Carthusian thrust his pale face between two
</p>
<p>guards. All the conspirators rose above the kneeling
</p>
<p>people. Every one put his hand to his belt or in his
</p>
<p>bosom, approaching close to the soldier whom he was
</p>
<p>to poniard.
</p>
<p>" What is he doing ? " asked the Carthusian. " Has
</p>
<p>he his hat upon his head ? "
</p>
<p>" He throws his hat upon the ground far from him,"

<p>" Mon Dieu ! qu'est-ce que ce monde ! "
</p>
<p>Dernieres paroles de M. Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>THE same day that the melancholy procession took place
</p>
<p>at Lyons, and during the scenes we have just witnessed,
</p>
<p>a magnificent fete was given at Paris with all the luxury
</p>
<p>and bad taste of the time. The powerful cardinal had
</p>
<p>determined to fill the first two towns in France with his
</p>
<p>pomp.
</p>
<p>The cardinal's return was the occasion on which this
</p>
<p>f6te was announced, as given to the king and all his
</p>
<p>court. Master of the empire by force, the cardinal de-
</p>
<p>sired to be master of opinion by seduction ; and weary
</p>
<p>of dominating, he hoped to please. The tragedy of
</p>
<p>" Mirame " was to be represented in a hall constructed
</p>
<p>expressly for this great day, which raised the expenses
</p>
<p>of this entertainment, says Pelisson, to three hundred

<p>thousand crowns.
</p>
<p>THE FETE. 251
</p>
<p>The entire guard of the prime minister J were under
</p>
<p>arms ; his four companies of musketeers and gems
</p>
<p>d'armes were ranged in a line upon the vast staircases,
</p>
<p>and at the entrance of the long galleries of the Palais-
</p>
<p>Cardinal. This brilliant Pandemonium, where the mor-
</p>
<p>tal sins have a temple on each floor, belonged that day
</p>
<p>to pride alone, which occupied it from top to bottom.
</p>
<p>Upon each step was placed one of the arquebusiers of
</p>
<p>the cardinal's guard, holding a torch in one hand and a
</p>
<p>long carabine in the other. The crowd of his gentlemen
</p>
<p>circulated between these living candelabra, while in the
</p>
<p>large garden, surrounded by huge chestnut-trees, now
</p>
<p>replaced by a range of arches, two companies of mounted
</p>
<p>light-horse, their muskets in their hands, were ready to
</p>
<p>obey the first order or the first fear of their master.
</p>
<p>The cardinal, carried and followed by his thirty-eight
</p>
<p>pages, took his seat in his box hung with purple, facing
</p>
<p>that in which the king was half reclining behind the
</p>
<p>green curtains which preserved him from the glare of
</p>
<p>the flambeaux. The whole court filled the boxes, and
</p>
<p>rose when the king appeared. The orchestra commenced
</p>
<p>a brilliant overture, and the pit was thrown open to all
</p>
<p>the men of the town and the army who presented them-
</p>
<p>selves. Three impetuous waves of spectators rushed in
</p>
<p>and filled it in an instant. They were standing, and so
</p>
<p>thickly pressed together that the movement of a single
</p>
<p>arm sufficed to cause in the crowd a movement similar
</p>
<p>to the waving of a field of corn. There was one man

</p>
<p>siers ; in 1632, four hundred foot musketry; in 1638, two companies

<p>of gens d'armes and light-horse were raised by the cardinal himself.
</p>
<p>252 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>whose head thus described a large circle, as that of a
</p>
<p>compass, without his feet quitting the spot to which they
</p>
<p>were fixed ; and some young men were carried out faint-
</p>
<p>ing. The minister, contrary to his usual custom, ad-
</p>
<p>vanced his skeleton head out of his box, and saluted the
</p>
<p>assembly with an air which was meant to be gracious.
</p>
<p>This grimace obtained an acknowledgment only from
</p>
<p>the boxes ; the pit was silent. Richelieu had wished to
</p>
<p>show that he did not fear the public judgment upon his
</p>
<p>work, and had given orders to admit without -distinction
</p>
<p>all who should present themselves. He began to repent
</p>
<p>of this, but too late. The impartial assembly was as
</p>
<p>cold as the tragtdie-pastorale itself. In vain did the
</p>
<p>theatrical bergeres, covered with jewels, raised upon red
</p>
<p>heels, with crooks ornamented with ribbons, and gar-
</p>
<p>lands of flowers upon their robes, which were stuck out
</p>
<p>with vertugadins, die of love in tirades of two hundred
</p>
<p>verses; in vain did the amants parfaits starve them-
</p>
<p>selves in solitary caves, deploring their death in emphatic
</p>
<p>tones, and fastening to their hair ribbons of the favorite
</p>
<p>color of their mistress ; in vain did the ladies of the
</p>
<p>court exhibit signs of perfect ecstasy, leaning over the
</p>
<p>edge of their boxes, and even attempt a few fainting-fits,
</p>
<p>the silent pit gave no other sign of life than the per-
</p>
<p>petual shaking of black heads with long hair.
</p>
<p>The cardinal bit his lips and played the abstracted
</p>
<p>during the first and second acts ; the silence in which
</p>
<p>the third and fourth passed off so wounded his paternal
</p>
<p>heart that he had himself raised half out of the balcony,
</p>
<p>and in this uncomfortable and ridiculous position signed

</p>
<p>to the court to remark the finest passages, and himself
</p>
<p>THE FETE. 253
</p>
<p>gave the signal for applause. It was acted upon from
</p>
<p>some of the boxes, but the impassible pit was more si-
</p>
<p>lent than ever ; leaving the affair entirely between the
</p>
<p>stage and the upper regions, they obstinately remained
</p>
<p>neuter. The master of Europe and France then cast a
</p>
<p>furious look at this handful of men who dared not to
</p>
<p>admire his work, feeling in his heart the wish of Nero,
</p>
<p>and thought for a moment how happy he should be if all
</p>
<p>those men had but one head.
</p>
<p>Suddenly this black and before silent mass became
</p>
<p>animated, and endless rounds of applause burst forth, to
</p>
<p>the great astonishment of the boxes, and above all, of
</p>
<p>the minister. He bent forward and bowed gratefully,
</p>
<p>but drew back on perceiving that the clapping of hands
</p>
<p>interrupted the actors every time they wished to proceed.
</p>
<p>The king had the curtains of his box, until then closed,
</p>
<p>opened, to see what excited so much enthusiasm. The
</p>
<p>whole court leaned forward from their boxes, and per-
</p>
<p>ceived among the spectators on the stage, a young man,
</p>
<p>humbly dressed, who had just seated himself there with
</p>
<p>difficulty. Every look was fixed upon him. He appeared
</p>
<p>utterly embarrassed by this, and sought to cover himself
</p>
<p>with his little black cloak, far too short for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose. " Le Cid ! le Cid ! " cried the pit, incessantly
</p>
<p>applauding. The terrified Corneille escaped behind the
</p>
<p>scenes, and all was again silent. The cardinal, beside
</p>
<p>himself with fury, had his curtain closed, and was car-
</p>
<p>ried into his galleries, where was performed another
</p>
<p>scene, prepared long before by the care of Joseph, who
</p>
<p>had tutored the attendants upon the point before quit-

<p>ting Paris. Cardinal Mazarin exclaimed that it would
</p>
<p>254 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>be quicker to pass his Eminence through a long glazed
</p>
<p>window, which was only two feet from the ground, and
</p>
<p>led from his box to the apartments ; and it opened, and
</p>
<p>the page passed his armchair through it. Hereupon a
</p>
<p>hundred voices rose to proclaim the accomplishment of
</p>
<p>the grand prophecy of Nostradamus. They said,
</p>
<p>" The bonnet rouge ! that 's Monseigneur ; quarante
</p>
<p>onces ! that 's Cinq-Mars ; tout finira ! that 's De
</p>
<p>Thou. What a providential incident ! His Eminence
</p>
<p>reigns over the future as over the present."
</p>
<p>He advanced thus upon his ambulatory throne through
</p>
<p>the long and splendid galleries, listening to this delicious
</p>
<p>murmur of a new flattery ; but insensible to the hum of
</p>
<p>voices which deified his genius, he would have given all
</p>
<p>their praises for one word, one single gesture of that
</p>
<p>immovable and inflexible public, even had that word
</p>
<p>been a cry of hatred ; for clamor can be stifled, but how
</p>
<p>avenge one's self on silence ? The people can be pre-
</p>
<p>vented from striking, but who can prevent their waiting ?
</p>
<p>Pursued by the troublesome phantom of public opinion,
</p>
<p>the gloomy minister only thought himself in safety when
</p>
<p>he reached the interior of his palace amid his flattering
</p>
<p>courtiers, whose adorations soon made him forget that a
</p>
<p>miserable pit had dared not to admire him. He had
</p>
<p>himself placed like a king in the midst of his vast apart-
</p>
<p>ments, and looking around him, attentively counted the
</p>
<p>powerful and submissive men who surrounded him. He
</p>
<p>counted them, and admired himself. The chiefs of all
</p>
<p>the great families, the princes of the Church, the presi-
</p>
<p>dents of all the parliaments, the governors of the pro-

<p>vinces, the marshals and general-in-chief of the armies,

</p>
<p>the nuncio, the ambassadors of all the kingdoms, the
</p>
<p>deputies and senates of the republics, were motionless,
</p>
<p>submissive, and ranged around him, as if awaiting his
</p>
<p>orders. There was no longer a look to brave his look,
</p>
<p>no longer a word to raise itself against his will, not a
</p>
<p>project that men dared to form in the most secret re-
</p>
<p>cesses of the heart, not a thought which did not proceed
</p>
<p>from his. Mute Europe listened to him by its repre-
</p>
<p>sentatives. From time to time he raised an imperious
</p>
<p>voice, and threw a self-satisfied word to this pompous
</p>
<p>circle, as a man who throws a copper coin among a
</p>
<p>crowd of beggars. Then might be distinguished, by the
</p>
<p>pride which lit up his looks and the joy visible in his
</p>
<p>countenance, the prince who had received such a favor.
</p>
<p>He found himself all at once transformed into another
</p>
<p>man, and seemed to have made a step in the hierarchy
</p>
<p>of power, so surrounded with unlooked-for adorations
</p>
<p>and sudden caresses was the fortunate courtier, whose
</p>
<p>obscure happiness the cardinal did not even perceive.
</p>
<p>The king's brother and the Due de Bouillon stood in the
</p>
<p>crowd, whence the minister did not deign to withdraw
</p>
<p>them. Only he ostentatiously said that it would be well
</p>
<p>to dismantle a few fortresses, spoke at length of the
</p>
<p>necessity of pavements and quays at Paris, and said in
</p>
<p>two words to Turenne that he might perhaps be sent to
</p>
<p>the army in Italy, to seek his baton as marechal from
</p>
<p>Prince Thomas.
</p>
<p>While Richelieu thus played with the great and small
</p>
<p>things of Europe, amid his noisy fete, the queen was
</p>
<p>informed at the Louvre that .the time was come for her

</p>
<p>to proceed to the cardinal's palace, where the king
</p>
<p>256 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>awaited her after the tragedy. The serious Anne of
</p>
<p>Austria did not witness any play ; but she could not
</p>
<p>refuse her presence at the fete of the prime minister.
</p>
<p>She was in her oratory, ready to depart, and covered
</p>
<p>with pearls, her favorite ornament ; standing opposite
</p>
<p>a large glass with Marie de Mantua, she was arranging
</p>
<p>more to her satisfaction one or two details of the young
</p>
<p>duchesse's toilet, who, dressed in a long pink robe, was
</p>
<p>herself contemplating with attention, though with some-
</p>
<p>what of ennui, and a little sullenness, the ensemble, of
</p>
<p>her appearance. The queen saw her own work in Marie,
</p>
<p>and more troubled than she, thought with apprehension
</p>
<p>of the moment when this transient calm would cease,
</p>
<p>despite the profound knowledge she had of the feeling
</p>
<p>but frivolous character of Marie. Since the conversa-
</p>
<p>tion at St. Germain, since the fatal letter, she had not
</p>
<p>quitted the young princess, and had bestowed all her
</p>
<p>care to lead her mind to the path which she had traced
</p>
<p>out for her ; for the most decided feature in the char-
</p>
<p>acter of Anne of Austria was an invincible obstinacy
</p>
<p>in her calculations, to which she would fain have sub-
</p>
<p>jected all events and all passions with a geometrical
</p>
<p>exactitude. There is no doubt that to this positive and
</p>
<p>immovable mind we must attribute all the misfor-
</p>
<p>tunes of her regency. The sombre reply of Cinq-Mars ;
</p>
<p>his arrest; his trial, all had been concealed from the
</p>
<p>Princesse Marie, whose first fault, it is true, had been
</p>
<p>a movement of self-love and a momentary forgetful-
</p>
<p>ness. However, the queen was good-hearted, and had
</p>
<p>bitterly repented her precipitation in writing words so

<p>decisive, and whose consequences had been so serious ;
</p>
<p>THE FETE. 257
</p>
<p>and all her endeavors had been applied to mitigate the
</p>
<p>results. In reflecting upon her conduct in reference to
</p>
<p>the happiness of France, she applauded herself for hav-
</p>
<p>ing thus, at one stroke, stifled the germ of a civil war
</p>
<p>which would have shaken the State to its very founda-
</p>
<p>tions. But when she approached her young friend and
</p>
<p>gazed on that charming being whose happiness she was
</p>
<p>thus destroying in its bloom, and reflected that an old
</p>
<p>man upon a throne, even, would not recompense her
</p>
<p>for the eternal loss she was about to sustain ; when
</p>
<p>she thought of the entire devotion, the total abnegation
</p>
<p>of himself, she had witnessed in a young man of twenty-
</p>
<p>two, of so lofty a character, and almost master of the
</p>
<p>kingdom, she pitied Marie, and admired from her very
</p>
<p>soul the man whom she had judged so ill.
</p>
<p>She would at least have desired to explain his worth
</p>
<p>to her whom he had loved so deeply, and who as yet
</p>
<p>knew him not ; but she still hoped that the conspirators
</p>
<p>assembled at Lyons would be able to save him, and
</p>
<p>once knowing him to be in a foreign land, she could
</p>
<p>tell all to her dear Marie.
</p>
<p>As to the latter, she had at first feared war. But
</p>
<p>surrounded by the queen's people, who had let nothing
</p>
<p>reach her ear but news dictated by this princess, she
</p>
<p>knew, or thought she knew, that the conspiracy had
</p>
<p>not taken place ; that the king and the cardinal had
</p>
<p>returned to Paris nearly at the same time ; that Mon-
</p>
<p>sieur, relapsed for a while, had reappeared at court ;
</p>
<p>that the Due de Bouillon, on ceding Sedan, had also
</p>
<p>been restored to favor; and that if the grand 6cuyer

<p>had not yet appeared, the reason was the more decided

</p>
<p>animosity of the cardinal towards him, and the greater
</p>
<p>part he had taken in the conspiracy. But common
</p>
<p>sense and natural justice clearly said that having acted
</p>
<p>under the orders of the king's brother, his pardon ought
</p>
<p>to follow that of this prince. Everything, then, had
</p>
<p>calmed the first uneasiness of her heart, while nothing
</p>
<p>had softened the kind of proud resentment she felt
</p>
<p>against Cinq-Mars, so indifferent as not to inform her
</p>
<p>of the place of his retreat, known to the queen and
</p>
<p>the whole court, while, she said to herself, she had
</p>
<p>thought but of him. Besides, for two months the balls
</p>
<p>and fetes had so rapidly succeeded each other, and so
</p>
<p>many mysterious duties had commanded her presence,
</p>
<p>that she had for reflection and regret scarce more
</p>
<p>than the time of her toilet, at which she was generally
</p>
<p>almost alone. Every evening she regularly commenced
</p>
<p>the general reflection upon the ingratitude and incon-
</p>
<p>stancy of men, a profound and novel thought, which
</p>
<p>never fails to occupy the head of a young person in the
</p>
<p>time of first love, but sleep never permitted her to
</p>
<p>finish the reflection ; and the fatigue of dancing closed
</p>
<p>her large black eyes ere her ideas had found time to
</p>
<p>classify themselves in her memory, or to present her
</p>
<p>with any very distinct images of the past. In the
</p>
<p>morning she was surrounded by the young princesses
</p>
<p>of the court, and ere she had well time to dress had
</p>
<p>to present herself in the queen's apartment, where

<p>awaited her the eternal, but now less disagreeable,

<p>homage of the prince palatine ; the Poles had had time

<p>because it enhances the importance of things always

<p>to preclude the idea of exhibiting suffering in their

<p>of Poland occupied by another queen would have ap-
</p>
<p>peared to her a monstrous thing. She did not look
</p>
<p>forward with pleasure to the period of ascending it,
</p>
<p>but had, however, taken possession of the homage which
</p>
<p>was rendered her beforehand. Thus, without avowing
</p>
<p>it even to herself, she greatly exaggerated the supposed
</p>
<p>offences of Cinq-Mars, which the queen had expounded
</p>
<p>to her at St. Germain.
</p>
<p>" You are fresh as the roses in this bouquet," said
</p>
<p>the queen. " Come, ma chere, are you ready ? What
</p>
<p>means this pouting air? Come, let me fasten this
</p>
<p>ear-ring. Do you not like these toys, eh ? Will you
</p>
<p>have another set of ornaments?"
</p>
<p>" Oh, no, Madame. I think that I ought not to
</p>
<p>decorate myself at all, for no one knows better than
</p>
<p>yourself how unhappy I am. Men are very cruel
</p>
<p>towards us !
</p>
<p>" I have since reflected on what you said to me, and
</p>
<p>all is now clear to me. Yes, it is quite true that he
</p>
<p>did not love me, for had he loved me, he would have
</p>
<p>renounced an enterprise that gave me so much uneasi-
</p>
<p>ness. I told him, I remember, indeed; which was very
</p>
<p>decided," she added, with an important and even solemn
</p>
<p>air, " that he would be a rebel, yes, Madame, a rebel.

<p>I told him so at St. Eustache. But I see that your
</p>
<p>260 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>Majesty was right. I am very unfortunate ! He had
</p>
<p>more ambition than love." Here a tear of pique
</p>
<p>escaped from her eyes, and rolled quickly down her
</p>
<p>cheek, as a pearl upon a rose.
</p>
<p>" Yes, it is certain," she continued, fastening her
</p>
<p>bracelets ; " and the greatest proof is that in the two
</p>
<p>months he has renounced his enterprise you told me
</p>
<p>that you had saved him he has not let me know the
</p>
<p>place of his retreat, while I during that time have been
</p>
<p>weeping, have been imploring all your power in his
</p>
<p>favor; have sought but a word that might inform me
</p>
<p>of his proceedings. I have thought but of him ; and
</p>
<p>even now I refuse every day the throne of Poland,
</p>
<p>because I wish to prove to the end that I am constant,
</p>
<p>that you yourself cannot make me disloyal to my at-
</p>
<p>tachment, far more serious than his, and that we are
</p>
<p>of higher worth than the men. But, however, I think I
</p>
<p>may attend this fete, since it is not a ball."
</p>
<p>" Yes, yes, my dear child ! come, come ! " said the
</p>
<p>queen, desirous of putting an end to this childish talk,
</p>
<p>which afflicted her all the more that it was herself who
</p>
<p>had encouraged it. " Come, you will see the union that
</p>
<p>prevails between the princes and the cardinal, and we
</p>
<p>shall perhaps hear some good news." They departed.
</p>
<p>When the two princesses entered the long galleries
</p>
<p>of the Palais-Cardinal, they were received and coldly
</p>
<p>saluted by the king and the minister, who, closely sur-
</p>
<p>rounded by silent courtiers, were playing at chess upon
</p>
<p>a small low table. All the ladies who entered with
</p>
<p>the queen or followed her, spread through the apart-

<p>ments ; and soon soft music sounded in one of the
</p>
<p>THE FETE. 261
</p>
<p>saloons, a gentle accompaniment to the thousand pri-
</p>
<p>vate conversations carried on round the play tables.
</p>
<p>Near the queen passed, saluting her, a young newly
</p>
<p>married couple, the happy Chabot and the beautiful
</p>
<p>Duchesse de Rohan. They seemed to shun the crowd,
</p>
<p>and to seek apart a moment to speak to each other of
</p>
<p>themselves. Every one received them with a smile and
</p>
<p>looked after them with envy. Their happiness was ex-
</p>
<p>pressed as strongly in the countenances of others as in
</p>
<p>their own.
</p>
<p>Marie followed them with her eyes. " Still they are
</p>
<p>happy," she whispered to the queen, remembering the
</p>
<p>censure which in her hearing had been thrown upon the
</p>
<p>match.
</p>
<p>But without answering, Anne of Austria, fearful that
</p>
<p>in the crowd some inconsiderate expression might in-
</p>
<p>form her young friend of the mournful event so inter-
</p>
<p>esting to her, placed herself with Marie behind the king.
</p>
<p>Monsieur, the prince palatine, and the Due de Bouillon,
</p>
<p>came to speak to her with a gay and lively air. The
</p>
<p>second, however, casting upon Marie a severe and scru-
</p>
<p>tinizing glance, said to her,
</p>
<p>" Madame la Princesse, you are most surprisingly
</p>
<p>beautiful and gay this evening."
</p>
<p>She was confused at these words, and at seeing the
</p>
<p>speaker walk away with a sombre air. She .addressed
</p>
<p>herself to the Due d'Orle'ans, who did not answer, and
</p>
<p>seemed not to hear her. Marie looked at the queen,
</p>
<p>and thought she remarked paleness and disquiet on her
</p>
<p>features. Meantime no one ventured to approach the

<p>minister, who was deliberately meditating his moves.
</p>
<p>262 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>Mazarin alone, leaning over his chair, followed all the
</p>
<p>strokes with a servile attention, giving gestures of admi-
</p>
<p>ration every time that the cardinal played. Application
</p>
<p>to the game seemed to have dissipated for a moment the
</p>
<p>cloud that usually shaded the minister's brow. He had
</p>
<p>just advanced a tower, which placed Louis's king in that
</p>
<p>false position which is called " stale mate," a situa-
</p>
<p>tion in which the ebony king, without being personally
</p>
<p>attacked, can neither advance nor retire in any direc-
</p>
<p>tion. The cardinal, raising his eyes, looked at his ad-
</p>
<p>versary and smiled with one corner of his mouth, not
</p>
<p>being able to avoid a secret mental analogy. Then ob-
</p>
<p>serving the dim eyes and dying countenance of the
</p>
<p>prince, he whispered to Mazarin,
</p>
<p>" Faith, I think he '11 go before me. He is greatly
</p>
<p>changed."
</p>
<p>At the same time he himself was seized with a long
</p>
<p>and violent cough, accompanied internally with the
</p>
<p>sharp, deep pain he so often felt in the side. At the
</p>
<p>sinister warning he put a handkerchief to his mouth,
</p>
<p>which he withdrew covered with blood. To hide it, he
</p>
<p>threw it under the table, and looked around him with a
</p>
<p>stern smile, as if to forbid observation. Louis XIII.,
</p>
<p>perfectly insensible, did not make the least movement
</p>
<p>beyond arranging his men for another game with a
</p>
<p>skeleton and trembling hand. These two dying men
</p>
<p>seemed to be throwing lots which should depart first.
</p>
<p>At this moment a clock struck the hour of midnight.
</p>
<p>The king raised his head.
</p>
<p>" Ah, ah ! " he said ; " this morning at twelve M. le

<p>Grand had a disagreeable time of it."
</p>
<p>THE FETE. 263
</p>
<p>A piercing shriek was uttered behind him. He shud-
</p>
<p>dered, and threw himself forward, upsetting the table.
</p>
<p>Marie de Mantua lay senseless in the arms of the queen,
</p>
<p>who, weeping bitterly, said in the king's ear,
</p>
<p>" Ah, Sire, your axe has a double edge."
</p>
<p>She then bestowed all her cares and maternal kisses
</p>
<p>upon the young princess, who, surrounded by all the
</p>
<p>ladies of the court, only came to herself to burst into a
</p>
<p>torrent of tears. As soon as she opened her eyes,
</p>
<p>" Alas ! yes, my child," said Anne of Austria. " My
</p>
<p>poor girl, you are Queen of Poland."
</p>
<p>It has often happened that the same event which
</p>
<p>causes tears to flow in the palace of kings has spread
</p>
<p>joy without, for the people ever suppose that happiness
</p>
<p>reigns at festivals. There were five days' rejoicings for
</p>
<p>the return of the minister, and every evening under the
</p>
<p>windows of the Palais-Cardinal and those of the Louvre
</p>
<p>pressed the people of Paris. The late disturbances had
</p>
<p>given them a taste for public movements. They rushed
</p>
<p>from one street to another with a curiosity at times in-
</p>
<p>sulting and hostile, sometimes walking in silent proces-
</p>
<p>sion, sometimes sending forth loud peals of laughter or
</p>
<p>prolonged yells, of which no one understood the mean-
</p>
<p>ing. Bands of young men fought in the streets and
</p>
<p>danced in rounds in the squares, as if manifesting some
</p>
<p>secret hope of pleasure and some insensate joy, grievous
</p>
<p>to the upright heart. It was remarkable that the most
</p>
<p>profound silence prevailed exactly in those places where

<p>the minister had ordered rejoicings, and that the people
</p>
<p>264 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>passed disdainfully before the illuminated faade of his
</p>
<p>palace. If some voices were raised, it was to read aloud
</p>
<p>in a sneering tone the legends and inscriptions with
</p>
<p>which the idiot flattery of some obscure writers had sur-
</p>
<p>rounded the portraits of the minister. One of these
</p>
<p>pictures was guarded by arquebusiers, who, however,
</p>
<p>could not preserve it from the stones which were thrown
</p>
<p>at it from a distance by unseen hands. It represented
</p>
<p>the cardinal-generalissimo wearing a casque surrounded
</p>
<p>by laurels. Above it was inscribed,
</p>
<p>" Grand due ! c'est justement que la France t'honore ;
</p>
<p>Ainsi que le dieu Mars dans Paris on t'adore."
</p>
<p>These fine phrases did not persuade the people that
</p>
<p>they were happy. They no more adored the cardinal
</p>
<p>than they did the god Mars, but they accepted his fetes
</p>
<p>because they served as a covering for disorder. All
</p>
<p>Paris was in an uproar. Men with long beards, carry-
</p>
<p>ing torches, measures of wine, and two drinking-cups,
</p>
<p>which they knocked together with a great noise, went
</p>
<p>along, arm in arm, shouting in chorus with rude voices

<p>an old round of the League,

<p>The frightful bands who howled forth these words
</p>
<p>traversed the Quais and the Pont-Neuf, squeezing against
</p>
<p>the high houses, which then covered the latter, the
</p>
<p>peaceful citizens who were led there by simple curiosity.
</p>
<p>Two young men, wrapped in cloaks, thus thrown one
</p>
<p>against the other, recognized each other by the light of
</p>
<p>a torch placed at the foot of the statue of Henri IV.,
</p>
<p>which had been lately raised.
</p>
<p>"What! still at Paris?" said Corneille to Milton.
</p>
<p>" I thought you were in London."
</p>
<p>" Hear you the people, sir ? Do you hear them ?
</p>
<p>What is this ominous chorus,
</p>
<p>' Les rois sont passes ' ? "
</p>
<p>" That is nothing, sir. Listen to their conversation."
</p>
<p>" The parliament is dead," said one of the men ; " the
</p>
<p>nobles are dead. Let us dance ; we are the masters.
</p>
<p>The old cardinal is dying. There is no longer any but
</p>
<p>the king and ourselves."

<p>" What ! is this the work of the minister who is

<p>called great among you, and even by other nations ? I

<p>do not understand him."

</p>
<p>swered Corneille. " But first, listen to the concluding

</p>
<p>266 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>we were not able to save MM. de Cinq-Mars and de Thou.
</p>
<p>We might have foreseen that prepared for death by long
</p>
<p>meditation, they would themselves refuse our aid ; but this
</p>
<p>idea did not occur to any of us. In the precipitation of our
</p>
<p>measures, we also committed the fault of dispersing our-
</p>
<p>selves too much in the crowd, so that we could not take a
</p>
<p>sudden resolution. I was unfortunately stationed near the
</p>
<p>scaffold ; and I saw our unfortunate friends advance to the
</p>
<p>foot of it, supporting the poor Abbe Quillet, who was des-
</p>
<p>tined to behold the death of the pupil whose birth he had
</p>
<p>witnessed. He sobbed aloud, and had strength enough only
</p>
<p>to kiss the hands of the two friends. We all advanced, ready
</p>
<p>to throw ourselves upon the guards at the announced signal ;
</p>
<p>but I saw with grief M. de Cinq-Mars cast his hat from him
</p>
<p>with an air of disdain. Our movement had been observed,
</p>
<p>and the Catalonian guard was doubled round the scaffold. I
</p>
<p>could see no more ; but I heard much weeping around me.
</p>
<p>After the three usual blasts of the trumpet, the recorder of
</p>
<p>Lyons, on horseback at a little distance from the scaffold,
</p>
<p>read the sentence of death, to which neither of the prisoners
</p>
<p>listened. M. de Thou said to M. de Cinq-Mars,
</p>
<p>"'Well, dear friend, which shall die first? Do you
</p>
<p>remember Saint Gervais and Saint Protais?'
</p>
<p>" ' Which j'ou think best,' answered Cinq-Mars.
</p>
<p>"The second confessor, addressing M. de Thou, said,
</p>
<p>' You are the elder.'
</p>
<p>" ' True,' said M. de Thou ; and turning to M. le Grand,
</p>
<p>* You are the most generous ; you will show me the way to
</p>
<p>the glory of heaven.'
</p>
<p>" ' Alas ! ' said Cinq-Mars ; ' I have opened to you that
</p>
<p>of the precipice ; but let us meet death nobl}-, and we shall
</p>
<p>revel in the glory and happiness of heaven ! '
</p>
<p>"Hereupon he embraced him, and ascended the scaffold

<p>with surprising address and agility. He walked round the
</p>
<p>scaffold, and contemplated the whole of the great assembly
</p>
<p>with a calm countenance which betrayed no sign of fear, and
</p>
<p>THE FETE. 267
</p>
<p>a serious and graceful manner. He then went round once
</p>
<p>more, saluting the people on every side, without appearing
</p>
<p>to recognize any of us, with a majestic and charming expres-
</p>
<p>sion of face ; he then knelt down, raising his eyes to heaven,
</p>
<p>adoring God, and recommending himself to him. As he em-
</p>
<p>braced the crucifix, the father confessor called to the people
</p>
<p>to pray for him ; and M. le Grand, opening his arms, still
</p>
<p>holding his crucifix, made the same request to the people.
</p>
<p>Then he readily knelt before the block, holding the stake,
</p>
<p>placed his neck upon it, and asked the confessor, ' Father, is
</p>
<p>this right?' Then, while they were cutting off his hair, he
</p>
<p>raised his eyes to heaven, and said, sighing,
</p>
<p>" ' My God, what is this world? My God, I offer thee my
</p>
<p>death as a satisfaction for my sins ! '
</p>
<p>"'What are you waiting for? What are you doing
</p>
<p>there ? ' he said to the executioner, who had not yet taken
</p>
<p>his axe from an old bag he had brought with him. His con-
</p>
<p>fessor, approaching, gave him a medallion ; and he, with an
</p>
<p>incredible tranquillity of mind, begged the father to hold the
</p>
<p>crucifix before his eyes, which he would not allow to be
</p>
<p>bound. I saw the two trembling hands of the Abbe Quillet,
</p>
<p>who raised the crucifix. At this moment a voice, as clear and
</p>
<p>pure as that of an angel, commenced the Ave maris Stella.
</p>
<p>In the universal silence I recognized the voice of M. de Thou,
</p>
<p>who was at the foot of the scaffold ; the people repeated the
</p>
<p>sacred strain. M. de Cinq-Mars clung more tightly to the
</p>
<p>stake ; and I saw a raised axe, made like the English axes.
</p>
<p>A terrible cry of the people from the Place, the windows,
</p>
<p>and the towers told me that it had fallen, and that the head
</p>
<p>had rolled to the ground. I had happily strength enough left
</p>
<p>to think of his soul, and to commence a prayer for him ; I
</p>
<p>mingled it with that which I heard pronounced aloud by our
</p>
<p>unfortunate and pious friend De Thou. I rose and saw him

</p>
<p>spring upon the scaffold with such promptitude that he might
</p>
<p>almost have been said to fly. The father and he recited a
</p>
<p>psalm ; he uttered it with the ardor of a seraphim, as if his
</p>
<p>268 CINQ-MARS.
</p>
<p>soul had borne his body to heaven. Then, kneeling down,
</p>
<p>he kissed the blood of Cinq-Mars as that of a martyr, and
</p>
<p>became himself a greater martyr. I do not know whether
</p>
<p>God was pleased to grant him this last favor ; but I saw with
</p>
<p>horror that the executioner, terrified no doubt at the first
</p>
<p>blow he had given, struck him upon the top of his head,
</p>
<p>whither the unfortunate 3"oung man raised his hand ; the
</p>
<p>people sent forth a long groan, and advanced against the
</p>
<p>executioner. The poor wretch, terrified still more, struck
</p>
<p>him another blow, which only cut the skin and threw him
</p>
<p>upon the scaffold, where the executioner rolled upon him to
</p>
<p>despatch him. A strange event terrified the people as much
</p>
<p>as the horrible spectacle. M. de Cinq-Mars' s old servant held
</p>
<p>his horse as at a military funeral ; he had stopped at the foot
</p>
<p>of the scaffold, and like a man paralyzed, watched his master
</p>
<p>to the end, then suddenty, as if struck by the same axe, fell
</p>
<p>dead under the blow which had taken off his master's head.
</p>
<p>"I write these sad details in haste, on board a Genoese
</p>
<p>galley, into which Fontrailles, Gondi, Entraigues, Beauvau,

</p>
<p>these two young men whom you lately saw so powerful.

<p>Their last sigh was that of the ancient monarchy.

<p>then, create republics for future ages, since he destroys
</p>
<p>the basis of your monarchy ? "
</p>
<p>" Look not so far," answered Corneille ; " he only
</p>
<p>seeks to reign until the end of his life. He has worked
</p>
<p>for the present and not for the future ; he has continued
</p>
<p>the work of Louis XI. ; and neither one nor the other
</p>
<p>knew what they were doing."
</p>
<p>The Englishman smiled.
</p>
<p>" I thought," he said, " that true genius followed
</p>
<p>another path. This man has shaken all that he ought
</p>
<p>to have supported, and they admire him ! I pity your
</p>
<p>nation."
</p>
<p>" Pity it not ! " exclaimed Corneille, warmly ; " a man
</p>
<p>passes away, but a people is renewed. This people, sir,
</p>

<p>" These are the secrets of the future," said Milton.
</p>
<p>" I, like yourself, admire your impassioned nation ; but
</p>
<p>I fear them for themselves. I do not well understand
</p>
<p>them ; and I do not recognize their wisdom when I see
</p>
<p>them lavishing their admiration upon men such as he
</p>
<p>who now rules you. The love of power is very puerile ;
</p>
<p>and this man is devoured by it, without having force
</p>
<p>enough to seize it wholly. By an utter absurdity he is
</p>
<p>a tyrant under a master. Thus has this colossus, never
</p>
<p>firmly balanced, been all but overthrown by the finger
</p>
<p>of a boy. Does that indicate genius ? No, no ! when
</p>
<p>genius condescends to quit the lofty regions of its true
</p>
<p>home for a human passion, at least it should grasp that
</p>
<p>passion in its entirety. Since Richelieu only aimed at
</p>
<p>power, why did he not, if he was a genius, make him-
</p>
<p>self absolute master of power ? I am going to see a

<p>man who is not yet known, and whom I see swayed

<p>by this miserable ambition ; but I think that he will go

</p>
<p>where many of the nobility awaited him, among others, M. le Comte
</p>
<p>de Suze, Monseigneur de Viviers, saluted him as he left his boat ; but
</p>
<p>he was obliged to delay speaking to him until he had reached the lodg-
</p>
<p>ing which had been prepared for him in the town. When his boat
</p>
<p>came to the shore, a wooden bridge was placed from the boat to the
</p>
<p>land. After it had been ascertained to be safe, they brought out the
</p>
<p>bed in which the said lord was reclining, for he was ill with an ulcer in
</p>
<p>his arm. Six powerful men carried the litter upon two poles, and the
</p>
<p>holders in which the men placed their hands were covered with buff
</p>
<p>leather. They wore on the shoulders and around the neck certain
</p>
<p>straps lined with cotton, with buff leather handles, which sustained the
</p>
<p>bars passed through them. In this manner these men carried the bed
</p>
<p>and the said lord through the towns to the houses where he was to
</p>
<p>lodge. But that which astonished every one was that he entered the
</p>
<p>houses by the windows ; for before he arrived, the masons whom he
</p>
<p>brought with him took out the windows of the houses, or made open-
</p>
<p>ings in the walls of the chambers in which he was to lodge, and then
</p>
<p>made a wooden bridge which ascended from the street to the window
</p>
<p>or openings of his lodging. Thus, in his portable bed, he passed
</p>
<p>through the streets, and along the bridge into another bed prepared for

</p>
<p>Montargny, of the university of our church. They took out the win-
</p>
<p>dow of the chamber which looks over the square; and the wooden
</p>
<p>bridge to ascend to it reached from the shop of Noel de Vielh, in the
</p>
<p>house of Ales on the north side, to the window into which the lord car-
</p>
<p>dinal was carried in the manner aforesaid. His chamber was guarded
</p>
<p>on every side, under the window, and at the sides, and on the roof.
</p>
<p>" His court or suite was composed of people of importance. Civil-
</p>
<p>ity, affability, and courtesy, went with them. The devotion with them
</p>
<p>was very great. The soldiers, who are generally indevout and impious,
</p>
<p>practised great devotions. The day after his arrival, Sunday, several
</p>
<p>of them confessed and communicated with demonstration of great piety.
</p>
<p>They committed no insolences in the town, living quite like young
</p>
<p>girls. The nobility, too, practised great devotion. When they were
</p>
<p>ou the Rhone, although there were many boatmen, as well with the
</p>
<p>boats as with the horses, no one dared to blaspheme. It was quite
</p>
<p>miraculous how such men could exhibit such control over themselves.
</p>
<p>They were never heard to utter any words but those which were neces-
</p>
<p>sary for the management of their barks, and these so modestly that
</p>
<p>every one was enchanted.

<p>Talleinant des Reaux says, in his Memoirs, vol. i. p.

<p>418, etc.,-
</p>
<p>" M. le Grand was firm ; and the internal combat he suffered did not
</p>
<p>appear oil his countenance. He died with an astonishing grandeur of
</p>
<p>courage, and did not condescend to harangue the people. He would
</p>
<p>not have his eyes blindfolded. His eyes were open when he was
</p>
<p>struck, and he held the stake so firmly that it was with great difficulty
</p>
<p>they removed his arms. He was full of courage, and died like a gentle-
</p>
<p>man. Although they had resolved not to subject him to the question,
</p>
<p>as the sentence purported, they however showed him the rack. This
</p>
<p>touched him, but did not induce him to forget his courageous mien ;
</p>
<p>and he was already taking off his pourpoint, for, as he supposed, the
</p>
<p>torture, when they merely made him raise his hand to affirm the
</p>
<p>truth."
</p>
<p>Several accounts add that when conducted to the tor-
</p>
<p>ture chamber, he exclaimed, " Whither are you leading me ?
</p>
<p>How disagreeable the scent is here ! " raising his handker-
</p>
<p>chief to his nose. This disdain appears to me to be one of
</p>
<p>those touches of bravoure moqueuse in which our history
</p>
<p>abounds.
</p>
<p>It recalls to me the jest of a young man, who, conducted
</p>
<p>to the scaffold of 1795, said to the driver of the tumbril,
</p>
<p>"Postilion, drive us well. You shall have something to

<p>drink." The French revenge themselves on death by jest-
</p>
<p>ing at it.

<p>Fragment of a letter from M. de Marca, councillor of State, to M. de
</p>
<p>Brienne, secretary of State, describing what passed at the trial of
</p>
<p>MM. de Cinq-Mars and de Thou.
</p>
<p>SIB, I thought you might be pleased to be informed of the princi-
</p>
<p>pal things which passed at the sentence which has been pronounced
</p>
<p>against MM. le Grand and de Thou. I have therefore taken the
</p>
<p>liberty to narrate it to you in the present letter. M. le Chaucelier
</p>
<p>commenced with the deposition of M. le Due d'Orleans, which he re-
</p>
<p>ceived in judicial form at Ville Tranche in Beau-Jolois, where Mon-
</p>
<p>sieur then was, and which was read to Monsieur in the presence of
</p>
<p>seven commissioners, who assisted M. le Chaucelier. In this he de-
</p>
<p>clared that M. le Grand had solicited him to unite with him, and with
</p>
<p>M. de Bouillon, and to treat with Spain, which they all three resolved
</p>
<p>upon in the Hotel de Venise, in the faubourg St. Germain, about
</p>
<p>last New Year's day.
</p>
<p>Font rallies was selected to proceed to Madrid, where he drew up the
</p>
<p>treaty with the count-duke, by which the King of Spain promised to
</p>
<p>furnish twelve thousand foot and five thousand horse, tried troops,
</p>
<p>forty thousand crowns to Monsieur to raise new levies, etc. . . .
</p>
<p>The knowledge of the treaty, without having revealed it, added to the
</p>
<p>proofs which are in the process, of interventions for the union of the
</p>
<p>accomplices, and the space of six weeks or more which M. de Thou
</p>
<p>passed with M. le Grand, lodging in his house near Perpignan, coun-
</p>
<p>selling him in his affairs, after the knowledge that the said Sieur le
</p>
<p>Grand had treated with Spain, and therefore that he was guilty of the
</p>
<p>crime of high treason. All this combined to make the judges condemn
</p>
<p>De Thou, according to the laws of the ordinance expressly made and
</p>
<p>provided against those who have been acquainted with conspiracy
</p>
<p>against the State, and have not revealed it, even though their silence
</p>
<p>had not been accompanied by the many other circumstances observable
</p>
<p>in the case of the said Sire de Thou. He died in a truly Christian
</p>
<p>manner, and as a man of courage, meriting a special description. M. le
</p>
<p>Grand also displayed a firmness always equal, and firmly reconciled to

<p>LYONS, this 16th September, 1642.
</p>
<p>NOTES AND HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS. 275
</p>
<p>After the letter of M. de Marca, there was printed, in
</p>
<p>1645, a journal, which has lately been attributed on no very
</p>
<p>clear grounds to a recorder of the city of Lyons. This re-
</p>
<p>port was greatly diffused at the time, and published, as we
</p>
<p>see, one hundred and seventy-two years ago. A portion of
</p>
<p>these details was reproduced in 1826 by the author of this
</p>
<p>work, who cited it ; and its principal features are scattered
</p>
<p>in the course of the composition. However, some of these
</p>
<p>facts, for which there was no room, were designedly left out,
</p>
<p>and have been omitted in the reprints which have been made
</p>
<p>of this report. It will not be profitless to reproduce them
</p>
<p>here. They complete the portraits of the characters of this
</p>
<p>work, and show that the author has been religiously faithful
</p>
<p>to history, and has not allowed his imagination to go beyond
</p>
<p>the circle traced by truth.
</p>
<p>" We have seen the favorite of the greatest and most just of kings
</p>
<p>lay his head upon the scaffold at the age of twenty-two, but with a
</p>
<p>firmness which can hardly be paralleled in our history. We have seen a
</p>
<p>councillor of State die like a saint for a crime which men cannot justly
</p>
<p>pardon. There is no one in the world, who, knowing their conspiracy
</p>
<p>against the State, would not consider them deserving of death ; and
</p>
<p>there are few people, who, knowing their condition and their noble
</p>
<p>natural qualities, would not pity their misfortune.
</p>
<p>"M. de Cinq-Mars arrived at Lyons, September the 4th of this
</p>
<p>present year, 1642, at two o'clock in the afternoon, in a coach drawn
</p>
<p>by four horses, in which were gardes du corps, with their muskets in
</p>
<p>their hands, and surrounded by foot-guards to the number of a hundred,
</p>
<p>belonging to M. le Cardinal-Due ; before them marched two hundred
</p>
<p>cavalry, most of them Catalonians, and following them were three
</p>
<p>hundred others, well mounted.
</p>
<p>" M. le Grand was dressed in dark-colored Holland cloth, covered
</p>
<p>with gold lace, and a scarlet mantle with large silver buttons ; he being
</p>
<p>upon the Pont du Rosne, before entering the town, asked M. Seyton,

<p>the lieutenant of the Scottish guards, if he would allow the door of the
</p>
<p>coach to be shut, which was refused him, and he was conducted over
</p>
<p>the Pont St. Jean, and thence to the Change, and thence, by the Rue
</p>
<p>de Flandre, to the foot of the chateau of Pierre-Encise, showing him-
</p>

</p>
<p>self while passing through the streets continually at one or the other
</p>
<p>door, saluting the people with a cheerful countenance, leaning half out
</p>
<p>of the carriage, and even recognizing many persons, whom he saluted
</p>
<p>by their names.
</p>
<p>"Arrived at Pierre-Encise, he was surprised when they told him
</p>
<p>he must alight, and get on horseback outside the town, to reach the
</p>
<p>castle.
</p>
<p>" ' This is, then, the last ride I shall take,' said he ; for he had im-
</p>
<p>agined that he was to go to the wood of Viiicenues, and he had often
</p>
<p>asked the guards whether they would allow him to hunt when he
</p>
<p>should be there.
</p>
<p>" His prison was at the foot of the great tower of the castle, which
</p>
<p>had no other view than two little windows, which looked into a small
</p>
<p>garden, at the foot of which were guards. M. Seyton slept with
</p>
<p>four guards in the antechamber, and there were guards at all the
</p>
<p>doors.
</p>
<p>"M. le Cardinal Bichy went to visit him the next day, and asked
</p>
<p>whether he should like them to send some one with whom he might
</p>
<p>amuse himself in his prison. He replied that he should be very glad,
</p>
<p>but that he did not deserve any one should take the trouble.
</p>
<p>" Consequently, M. le Cardinal de Lyons sent for the Pere Mak-
</p>
<p>valette, Jesuit, whom he commissioned to visit him, since he desired it ;
</p>
<p>which he did on the 6th, at five in the morning, remaining with him
</p>
<p>until eight o'clock. He found him in a red damask bed, very uncom-
</p>
<p>fortable, which made him pale and weak. The good father knew so
</p>
<p>well how to please him that he asked for him again in the evening ;
</p>
<p>and so he continued to visit him, morning and evening, the whole time
</p>
<p>of his imprisonment. And he afterwards made a report to MM. le
</p>
<p>Cardinal-Due and le Cardinal de Lyons, and to M. le Chancelier, of all
</p>
<p>that he had said ; and this same father had a long conference with his
</p>
<p>ducal Eminence, although the latter gave audience to no one at the
</p>
<p>time.
</p>
<p>" On the 7th, M. le Chancelier went to visit M. de Cinq-Mars, and

</p>
<p>treated him very civilly, telling him that he had no reason to fear, but
</p>
<p>on the contrary, to hope everything that was to his advantage ; that he
</p>
<p>well knew he had to deal with a good judge, who would assuredly not
</p>
<p>forget the favors he had received from his benefactor ; that he well knew
</p>
<p>that it was through his goodness and power that the king had not de-
</p>
<p>prived him of his charge; that this favor was so great that it not
</p>

</p>
<p>only merited an enduring remembrance, but also eternal gratitude ; aud
</p>
<p>that this was one of the occasions on which to show his gratitude.
</p>
<p>The apparent reason for these professions was that M. le Grand
</p>
<p>had once softened the king, who was greatly enraged against M. le
</p>
<p>Chancelier ; but the true reason was the fear that M. de Cinq-Mars
</p>
<p>might refuse to have him for judge, and appeal to the parliament of
</p>
<p>Paris, in order that he might be delivered by the people, who loved him
</p>
<p>passionately.
</p>
<p>" M. le Grand replied that this courtesy filled him with shame and
</p>
<p>confusion. ' But, however,' said he, ' I see clearly, by the manner in
</p>
<p>which they are proceeding in this affair, that they are determined to have
</p>
<p>my life. // is all over Kith me ; the king has abandoned me. I look upon
</p>
<p>myself as a victim whom they are about to sacrifice to the passions of my
</p>
<p>enemies and the king's weakness.' To which M. le Chancelier replied
</p>
<p>that these sentiments were not just, and that his experience was quite
</p>
<p>to the contrary. ' May God grant it be so ! ' said M. le Grand; ' but I
</p>
<p>cannot believe it.'
</p>
<p>" On the 8th, M. le Chancelier went to hear him, accompanied by
</p>
<p>six masters of requests, two presidents, and six counsellors of Grenoble,
</p>
<p>who, having questioned him from six in the morning to two in the after-
</p>
<p>noon, could get nothing from him to make out the case."
</p>
<p>This report, which, as I have said, was printed at the
</p>
<p>end of the letter of M. de Marca, has also this curious
</p>
<p>anecdote, which attests the incredible firmness of mind of
</p>
<p>M. de Thou,
</p>
<p>" After his confession, he was visited by Father Jean Terrasse, of the
</p>
<p>convent of the Observance de Saint Francois at Tarascon, who had
</p>
<p>visited and consoled him during his imprisonment at Tarascon. He
</p>
<p>was glad to see him, and walked with him some time, holding a spiritual
</p>
<p>conversation. This father came in connection with a vow which M. de
</p>
<p>Thou had made at Tarascon, which was, should he be delivered, to
</p>
<p>found a chapel of three hundred livres annual rent in the church of the
</p>
<p>Peres Cordeliers of this town of Tarascon. He gave orders for this

<p>foundation, desiring to acquit himself of his vow, since God, he said,
</p>
<p>was about to deliver him, not only from a prison of stone, but also
</p>
<p>from the prison of his body. He asked for ink and paper, and
</p>
<p>wrote this beautiful inscription, which he directed to be placed in this
</p>
<p>chapel :
</p>
<p>278 NOTES AND HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS.

<p>confitebor tibi, Domine, quoniam

</p>
<p>in salutem.
</p>
<p>" In this inscription we must admire the readiness and clearness of
</p>
<p>his mind ; and it will make those who consider it acknowledge that the
</p>
<p>fear of death had not the power to cause him any agitation of mind.
</p>
<p>He begged M. Thome to give his compliments to the Cardinal de Lyons,
</p>
<p>and to inform him that had it pleased God to deliver him from this
</p>
<p>peril, he had designed to quit the world, and to give himself up entirely
</p>
<p>to the service of God.
</p>
<p>" He wrote two letters, which were taken open to M. le Chaucelier,
</p>
<p>and then placed in the hands of his confessor to read them; these letters
</p>
<p>being sealed, he said, ' There are my last thoughts for the world ; let us
</p>
<p>depart for Paradise.' And from that time he continued without inter-
</p>
<p>ruption his spiritual discourses, and confessed a second time. He asked
</p>
<p>at intervals whether the time for the execution approached, when they
</p>
<p>were to be bound, and begged that they would inform him when the
</p>
<p>executor of justice was there, that he might embrace him ; but he only
</p>
<p>saw him on the scaffold."

<p>" M. de Cinq-Mars, without having his eyes bandaged, laid his neck

<p>upon the block very properly, holding his face straight out towards the

<p>front of the scaffold ; and tightly embracing the stake with his arms, he
</p>
<p>closed his eyes and mouth, awaiting the blow which the executioner gave
</p>
<p>him, deliberately and heavily, standing on his left, and holding his axe in
</p>
<p>both hands. Upon receiving the blow, he sent forth a loud cry, ' Ah ! '
</p>
<p>which was stifled in his blood. He raised his knees above the block,

<p>as if about to rise, and then subsided into the position in which he was
</p>
<p>before. The head not being entirely separated from the body by the
</p>
<p>blow, the executioner passed behind to the right ; and taking the head
</p>
<p>by the hair with his right hand, with the left he sawed off part of the
</p>
<p>tracheal artery, and the skin of the neck which was not cut through,

</p>
<p>and then threw the head on the scaffold, whence it bounded to the
</p>
<p>ground, where it was remarked that it still made half a turn more and
</p>
<p>palpitated for some time. The face was turned towards the nuns of
</p>
<p>St. Pierre, and the crown of the head towards the scaffold, with the
</p>
<p>eyes open. His body remained firm against the block, which he still
</p>
<p>embraced, until the executioner dragged it away to strip it, which he
</p>
<p>did, and then covered it with a cloth, and threw his cloak over it. The
</p>
<p>head, having been placed upon the scaffold, was laid with the body
</p>
<p>under the same cloth."
</p>
<p>The execution of. M. de Thou, like that of M. de Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars, resembles an assassination. I give the account of it
</p>
<p>from the same journal, more horribly minute than in the
</p>
<p>letter from Montresor,
</p>
<p>" The executioner came to cover his eyes with the handkerchief ; but
</p>
<p>he did it badly, placing the corners of the handkerchief so that they
</p>
<p>covered his mouth. He raised it, and arranged it better. He adored
</p>
<p>the crucifix before setting his neck upon the block. He kissed the
</p>
<p>blood of Cinq-Mars, which had remained there. Then he laid his neck
</p>
<p>firmly upon the block, which a Jesuit brother had wiped with his hand-
</p>
<p>kerchief, because it was wet with blood, and asked this brother whether
</p>
<p>he was well placed, who told him to advance his head somewhat far-
</p>
<p>ther, which he did. At the same time, the executioner, perceiving that
</p>
<p>the strings of his shirt were not untied, and that they tightened his
</p>
<p>throat, put his hand to the collar to unfasten them. Feeling this, he
</p>
<p>asked, ' What is it ? Must I take off my shirt ? ' and already began to
</p>
<p>do so. They answered, ' No, you must merely untie the strings,'
</p>
<p>which having done, he turned down his shirt-collar, and laid bare his
</p>
<p>neck and shoulders ; and having again placed his neck upon the block,
</p>
<p>he pronounced his last words, which were, ' Maria mater gratise, mater
</p>
<p>misericordia, in manus tuas ! ' And then his arms began to tremble,
</p>
<p>awaiting the blow, which was struck high in the neck too near the
</p>
<p>head, by which blow his neck was cut only half through. The body
</p>
<p>fell on the left side of the block on its back, the face turned towards

<p>tioner wanted to turn him over, to finish as he had begun ; but terrified
</p>
<p>by the cries which were raised against him, he struck him two or three

<p>blows upon the throat, and thus severed his head, which remained on

<p>the scaffold.

<p>" The executioner, having stripped him, carried his body, covered
</p>
<p>with a cloth, to the carriage which had brought them, where he also
</p>
<p>placed that of M. de Cinq-Mars, and their heads, which both had the
</p>
<p>eyes still open, especially that of M. de Thou, which appeared alive.
</p>
<p>Thence they were taken to the Feuillants, where M. de Cinq-Mars was
</p>
<p>interred before the high altar under the balustrade of the said church,
</p>
<p>through the goodness and authority of M. du Gay, the treasurer of
</p>
<p>France in the district of Lyons. M. de Thou was embalmed by the

<p>care of his sister, and placed in a leaden coffin to be carried to the

</p>
<p>pointing out that it is a great lesson for us of the inconstancy of the
</p>
<p>things of this world and the frailty of our nature."
</p>
<p>The last wills of these two noble young men have come
</p>
<p>down to us in the letters which they wrote after their sen-
</p>
<p>tence was pronounced. That of M. de Cinq-Mars to the
</p>
<p>Marechale d'Effiat, his mother, may appear cold to some
</p>
<p>persons, from the difficulty they may experience in trans-
</p>
<p>porting themselves to that epoch, when in the most serious
</p>
<p>circumstances people sought rather to repress their emo-
</p>
<p>tions than to express them with warmth, and in which
</p>
<p>great people, in their writings and conversation, avoided

<p>the pathetic as much as we cultivate it.

<p>MADAME, MY DEAREST AND HIGHLY HONORED MOTHER, I write

</p>
<p>other, that you obtain from the king the money I expended in my office

<p>you will have the generosity to pay my creditors. All matters of this

<p>request, which I make for the repose of my soul. Believe me, Madame,

<p>in this, should your own sentiment be opposed to my wish, since I,
</p>
<p>whose every step conducts me to a near death, am more capable
</p>
<p>than yourself of judging the value of the things of this world. Adieu,
</p>
<p>Madame ; forgive me if I have ever failed in my respect towards you

<p>The original manuscript is in the Royal Library at Paris, 1
</p>
<p>written in a firm and calm hand.
</p>
<p>The last letter of Frangois Augusts de Thou.
</p>
<p>We have seen that left alone in his prison, M. de Thou
</p>
<p>wrote a letter which was given to his confessor. " Here,"
</p>
<p>said he, " is the last thought I shall have for this world."
</p>
<p>We have seen the efforts he made to detach himself from
</p>
<p>this last thought, and the fervent prayers he repeated.
</p>
<p>Striking his breast, he prays God to have mercy upon him ;
</p>
<p>he rejects the world; he already envelops himself in his
</p>
<p>shroud. This last thought was the most cruel that can
</p>
<p>tear the heart of man. It was a last look towards a beloved
</p>
<p>woman; it was an adieu to his mistress, the Princesse de
</p>
<p>Guemene. Its tone is grave, and the respect for rank is
</p>
<p>not neglected any more than that of his own personal
</p>
<p>dignity, and the solemn moment which approaches. I
</p>
<p>have recently found this precious letter. 2 It runs thus :
</p>
<p>MADAME, I have never felt under an obligation to you during my
</p>
<p>whole life until this moment, when about to leave it; I lose it with the
</p>
<p>less regret that you have rendered it unhappy to me. I hope that the
</p>
<p>life of the other world will be very different for me from this, and that
</p>
<p>I shall find there happiness as much above the imagination of man as
</p>
<p>it should be above his hope ; mine, Madame, is founded only on the
</p>
<p>goodness of God and the merits of the passion of his Son, alone capable
</p>
<p>of effacing my sins, for which I am answerable to his justice, and which

<p>are of such excess that nothing but his mercy can exceed them. I en-
</p>
<p>treat your pardon, Madame, with my whole heart for all I may have
</p>
<p>done which may have displeased you, and I make the same prayer to
</p>
<p>all the persons whom I have hated for your sake, protesting to you,
</p>
<p>Madame, that as far as the fidelity I owe to my God will allow it,

<p>I die, Madame, too assuredly, your very humble and very obedient

</p>
<p>LYONS, this 12 September, 1642.
</p>
<p>How bitter a reproach ! how melancholy a recurrence to
</p>
<p>life! If this woman were worthy of him, how could she
</p>
<p>have received such a letter and live! Could she ever be
</p>
<p>consoled for having deserved such a farewell?
</p>
<p>The life of Madame la Princesse de Guemene scarcely
</p>
<p>permits us to think that it was her severity that caused
</p>
<p>such sorrow, such profound grief. Tallemant des Reaux
</p>
<p>says in several places that M. de Thou was her lover.
</p>
<p>" They say" he adds (torn, i., p. 418), "that he wrote to her
</p>
<p>after his condemnation ! " It 'is this letter which we have
</p>
<p>just read. It appears to me to be written by a man like
</p>
<p>the misanthrope of Moliere, but with more piety; "all
</p>
<p>the persons whom, I have hated for your sake," painfully
</p>
<p>resembles :
</p>
<p>" C'est que tout 1'univers est bien reu de vous."

</p>
<p>so long as the religion of honor shall exist among us; it
</p>
<p>NOTES AND HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS. 285
</p>
<p>is the impossibility of denunciation from the lips of the man
</p>
<p>of honor.
</p>
<p>Statesmen of every age who have endeavored to introduce
</p>
<p>denunciation have hitherto completely failed, to the glory
</p>
<p>of our country. The fact that it was Louis XI., whose
</p>
<p>character was baseness itself, and his genius treachery,
</p>
<p>who first attempted this enterprise, is in itself a stain upon
</p>
<p>it; but this tree of evil, which he planted at Plessis-les-
</p>
<p>Tours, did not bring forth its poisonous fruit, and no one
</p>
<p>was found to denounce a citizen,
</p>
<p>" Et, sa tete a la main, demander son salaire."
</p>
<p>The reward was, however, set forth in the edict of
</p>
<p>Louis XI., dated the twenty-second day of December, one
</p>
<p>thousand four hundred and seventy-seven : an edict easy
</p>
<p>to comprehend in such a monarch at the moment when
</p>
<p>the Comte de la Marche, Jacques d'Armagnac, had just
</p>
<p>had his head cut off for high treason, and his lands, an im-
</p>
<p>mense property, impudently distributed among his judges,
</p>
<p>a monstrous inheritance, unheard of since the days of
</p>
<p>Tiberius and Nero, and which was accomplishing, while
</p>
<p>they forced the children of the condemned to receive,
</p>
<p>drop by drop, upon their foreheads the blood of their
</p>
<p>father from the scaffold above. After this fine stroke,
</p>
<p>he might go on, and imagine he had a right so to despise
</p>
<p>France as to cast at her such an edict, and to propose to
</p>
<p>her new infamies. Accustomed as he was to make a
</p>
<p>perpetual traffic in consciences for ready money, never
</p>
<p>making a step without a purse in one hand and an axe
</p>
<p>in the other, he followed the old maxim, which is no
</p>
<p>great effort of genius, and which Machiavel has so highly
</p>
<p>praised, to place men between hope and fear. Louis XI.
</p>
<p>played his game subtly; but at last France arose and
</p>
<p>nobly played hers, showing him that she had other men
</p>
<p>than his barber. Despite the word of his invention, for

<p>translation of denunciation into revelation, no one person
</p>
<p>deliberately left his own house to go and repeat a secret
</p>
<p>which in the openness of friendship had escaped another
</p>
<p>at the table or fireside. The vile ordinance was forgotten
</p>
<p>until the time when the Cardinal de Richelieu ordered its
</p>
<p>resurrection. M. de Thou had no stronghold to give in
</p>
<p>exchange for his pardon, like M. de Bouillon, and his
</p>
<p>death would add to the terror inspired by that of Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars. If he had been pardoned, he would have been a
</p>
<p>young and virtuous censor ; destined to survive the old
</p>
<p>minister, he would perhaps, like his father, be an historian,
</p>
<p>and write the life of the cardinal ; and would be a judge in
</p>
<p>his turn, an inflexible judge, indignant at the death of
</p>
<p>his friend, M. le Grand. M. de Richelieu thought of all
</p>
<p>this ; and these reasons, which do not escape me, would
</p>
<p>not escape him. For the sake of mere impartiality, let us
</p>
<p>forget his angry quip about the President de Thou : " He
</p>
<p>put my name in his history, I '11 place his in mine." Ac-
</p>
<p>quit him of vengeance, there still remains an inflexible
</p>
<p>hardness of heart, profound bad faith, and the most im-
</p>
<p>moral egoism. 1 The virtuous life of M. de Thou, which
</p>
<p>might become useful to a State where everything was be-
</p>
<p>coming corrupt, was disagreeable and dangerous to the
</p>
<p>minister. He did not hesitate ; let us not hesitate, then, to
</p>
<p>judge this justice. We must by all means ascertain the
</p>
<p>grounds of these celebrated State reasons, which have been
</p>
<p>converted by some into a kind of holy ark not to be touched.
</p>
<p>Bad actions leave us the germ of bad laws, and there is no
</p>
<p>passing minister who does not seek to plant them, to pre-
</p>
<p>serve the source of his borrowed power, through love for
</p>
<p>this doubtful eclat. One thing may, however, reassure
</p>
<p>1 Dupuy has it in his Memoirs that when the exempt brought him the
</p>
<p>letter from the chancellor which announced the sentence,
</p>
<p>" And M. de Thou also ! " said the cardinal, with an air of satisfaction.

<p>I do not think there is in history a fact more adapted
</p>
<p>than the trial of Auguste de Thou to testify against this
</p>
<p>fatal idea, should the evil genius of France ever will that
</p>
<p>the proposition of a law of non-revelation be renewed.
</p>
<p>As nothing more inspires sound replies, or presents them
</p>
<p>in clearer expressions than imminent danger to a superior
</p>
<p>man, I see that from the first M. de Thou went to the bot-
</p>
<p>tom of the question of right and possibility with his reason,
</p>
<p>and to the bottom of the question of sentiment and honor
</p>
<p>with his noble heart. Let us listen to him,
</p>
<p>" The day of his confrontation with M. de Cinq-Mars, he said 1 that
</p>
<p>after having deeply communed with himself whether he ought to de-
</p>
<p>clare to the king [seeing him every day at the camp of Perpiguan] the
</p>
<p>knowledge he had of this treaty, he resolved for several reasons not to
</p>
<p>mention it :
</p>
<p>"1. He must have accused Monsieur, the king's brother, of a State
</p>
<p>crime, and M. de Bouillon and M. le Grand, who were all much more
</p>
<p>powerful and more accredited than he, and that it was certain he would
</p>
<p>succumb in this action, of which he had no verifying proof. ' I could
</p>
<p>not have cited,' says he, ' the testimony of Fontrailles, who was ab-
</p>
<p>sent ; and M. le Grand would perhaps have denied then that he had
</p>
<p>spoken to me of it. I should have then passed for a calumniator, and
</p>
<p>my honor, which will ever be dearer to me than my life, would have
</p>
<p>been irreparably lost.'
</p>
<p>" 2. 'As to M. le Grand,' he adds those words which have been
</p>
<p>already quoted, and which possess an incomparable beauty in their
</p>
<p>antique, I might almost say evangelic, simplicity, ' he held me to be
</p>
<p>his only and faithful friend, and I would not betray him.' "
</p>
<p>Whatever may be the secret enterprise assumed,
</p>
<p>whether against a crowned head or against the constitution

</p>
<p>of a democratic State, or against the bodies which represent a
</p>
<p>nation ; whatever may be the nature of the execution or the
</p>
<p>plot, whether assassination, or expulsion by armed force,
</p>
<p>or insurrection of the people, or corruption and revolt of
</p>
<p>the paid soldiery, the situation will be the same between
</p>
<p>the conspirator and him who has received his confidence.
</p>
<p>His first thought will be the irreparable and eternal loss of
</p>
<p>his honor and his name, either as calumniator, if he fur-
</p>
<p>nishes no proofs, or as a base informer if he gives them,
</p>
<p>punished in the first case by ignominious penalties, pun-
</p>
<p>ished in the second by the public detestation, which points
</p>
<p>him out with the finger as stained with the blood of his
</p>
<p>friends.
</p>
<p>When M. de Thou deigned to explain this first cause of
</p>
<p>silence, I believe that it was in order to place himself on a
</p>
<p>level with the minds which judged him, and in order to
</p>
<p>enter into the general tone of the trial, and the precise
</p>
<p>terms of the laws, that ever assume themselves made only
</p>
<p>for the basest souls, which they circumscribe and press
</p>
<p>upon by gross barriers, and an inexorable and uniform
</p>
<p>necessity. He demonstrated that he could not have been
</p>
<p>an informer, even had he wished it. He implies, "If I
</p>
<p>had been infamous, I could not have accomplished my in-
</p>
<p>famy ; no one would have believed me." But after these
</p>
<p>few words upon the physical impossibility, he adds the
</p>
<p>motive of the moral impossibility, a genuine motive, and
</p>
<p>one of an immutable, eternal verity, which all religions
</p>
<p>have recognized and sanctified, which all nations have held
</p>
<p>in honor, " He held me to be his friend."
</p>
<p>Not only did he not betray him, but it will be observed
</p>
<p>that in all his interrogatories and confrontations with
</p>
<p>M. de Bouillon and M. de Cinq-Mars, he names and com-
</p>
<p>promises no one. 1

<p>NOTES AND HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS. 289
</p>
<p>" Immediately I was alone with M. de Thou," says Fontrailles, in
</p>
<p>his Memoirs, " he told me of the journey I had just made into Spain,
</p>
<p>which much surprised me, for I believed that it had been concealed
</p>
<p>from him, in conformity with the deliberation which had been taken on
</p>
<p>the subject. When I asked him how he had learned it, he declared to
</p>
<p>me very frankly in confidence that he knew it from the queen, and that
</p>
<p>she had it from Monsieur.
</p>
<p>" I was not ignorant that her Majesty had greatly desired a cabal
</p>
<p>to be got up, and had contributed to it with all her power." 1
</p>
<p>M. de Thou might, then, have supported himself upon
</p>
<p>this authority; but he knows that he shall thus cause
</p>
<p>Queen Anne of Austria to be persecuted, and he is silent.
</p>
<p>He is also silent concerning the king himself, and does not
</p>
<p>deign to repeat what he said to the cardinal in his private
</p>
<p>interview. He will not receive his life at this price.
</p>
<p>As to M. de Cinq-Mars, he has but one reason to give,
</p>
<p>" he held me to be his friend." Even had he, instead of being
</p>
<p>a proved friend, been merely a man connected with M. de
</p>
<p>Cinq-Mars by transient relations, he held him to be his
</p>
<p>friend, he had faith in him, and he would not betray him.
</p>
<p>Everything is in that.
</p>
<p>When the Christian religion instituted confession, it, as
</p>
<p>I have elsewhere said, deified confidence. As people might
</p>
<p>have distrusted their confidant, it hastened to declare the
</p>
<p>priest who should reveal the avowal made to his ear crimi-
</p>
<p>nal and worthy of eternal death. Nothing less than this
</p>
<p>could suddenly transform a stranger into a friend, a brother,
</p>
<p>and cause a Christian to open his soul to the first coiner,
</p>
<p>to the unknown person whom he may never see again, and
</p>
<p>sleep at night in peace, as sure of his secret as if he had
</p>
<p>told it to God alone.
</p>
<p>Thus, all that the confessor could do, with the assistance
</p>
<p>of his faith and the authority of the Church, has been to
</p>
<p>attain the being considered by the penitent as a friend, to

<p>effect those salutary overflowings, those sacred tears, those

</p>
<p>VOL. II. 19
</p>
<p>290 NOTES AND HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS.
</p>
<p>complete narratives, those reserveless confidences which
</p>
<p>grave and true friendship, before the institution of confes-
</p>
<p>sion, had alone the right to receive, friendship, the holy
</p>
<p>friendship which returns in virtuous counsel what it re-
</p>
<p>ceives in guilty avowals.
</p>
<p>If, then, the confessor pretends to the tenderness of heart,
</p>
<p>to the supreme goodness of the friend, what friend ought
</p>
<p>not to regard as his first duty the entire security of
</p>
<p>the secret deposited in him, as in the tabernacle of the
</p>
<p>confessor ?
</p>
<p>And it is not merely of the old and tried friend that we
</p>
<p>speak, but of every man who by another man has been
</p>
<p>treated as a friend, of the first comer who, hand linked in
</p>
<p>hand, has received a serious confidence. The right of hos-
</p>
<p>pitality is as old as the institution of the family, old as
</p>
<p>the human race itself. No tribe, no horde, however savage
</p>
<p>it may be, conceives the possibility of delivering up its
</p>
<p>guest. A secret is a guest, seeking refuge in the heart of
</p>
<p>an honest man, as in an inviolable asylum. Whosoever
</p>
<p>delivers up that secret and sells it, is out of the law of
</p>
<p>nations.
</p>
<p>It were a deep shame indeed for the government that
</p>
<p>could only maintain its brief existence at the price of such
</p>
<p>barbarian laws, or stand erect except by the aid of such
</p>
<p>dark supports. But even though it wished to make use of
</p>
<p>them, it could not. For it to be practicable, civilization
</p>
<p>must have progressed with the wrong foot foremost. But
</p>
<p>the world has attained a general delicacy of sentiment
</p>
<p>which renders it out of the question even to suggest such
</p>
<p>public actions. It is quite extraordinary, indeed, how
</p>
<p>things perfectly permissible and understood only a few
</p>
<p>centuries back are now not done or said or even seriously
</p>
<p>named, and this without any of them having been formally
</p>
<p>abolished. But this is one of those genuine changes of

</p>
<p>manners which bring forth genuine and enduring laws.
</p>
<p>What country is there now, however remote, where the
</p>
<p>NOTES AND HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS. 291
</p>
<p>man judging would venture to outrage public opinion by
</p>
<p>arrogating to himself the spoils of the man judged ? All
</p>
<p>laws are not the work of human hands. The law which
</p>
<p>prohibits this monstrous inheritance is not a written law ;
</p>
<p>it has tacitly set up its pillar among us. By its side is
</p>
<p>that which says that man should not be a denouncer / and
</p>
<p>the humblest journalist in our day would not venture to sit
</p>
<p>down at the table of him who had failed in obedience to
</p>
<p>this law.
</p>
<p>If the politicians of our time must need revive some old
</p>
<p>engine of barbarian ages, I should, for my part, prefer the
</p>
<p>bringing out and cleaning and polishing and applying the
</p>
<p>thumb-screw and the rack, for these and the other instru-
</p>
<p>ments of torture would at all events defile only the body
</p>
<p>and not the soul of God's creatures. They might perhaps
</p>
<p>extort a shriek from the agonized flesh ; but the cry of the
</p>
<p>nerves and the bones under the red-hot pincers were less
</p>
<p>dishonorable to a government than the frigid buying and
</p>
<p>selling of a man's head, as it were, over a counter. In the
</p>
<p>annals of the vile, no name stands lower than that of
</p>
<p>JUDAS.
</p>
<p>Yes, better the peril of the prince than the demoraliza-
</p>
<p>tion of the whole human species. Better the downfall of a
</p>
<p>dynasty, or of a particular form of government, better that
</p>
<p>even of a nation, for all these things may be replaced,
</p>
<p>may be formed again, than the death of virtue in man.
</p>
<p>THE END.
