<p>EDITOR'S PREFACE.
</p>
<p>In putting forth a publication like the present,
</p>
<p>the authenticity of which will undoubtedly be
</p>
<p>strongly contested by those who are interested in so
</p>
<p>doing  one, moreover, which does not belong to the
</p>
<p>class of writings emanating from the Societary School,
</p>
<p>and which I edit in my own individual capacity, I am
</p>
<p>bound to accompany it with a testimonial, and with
</p>
<p>some personal explanations. I.
</p>
<p>I had long been aware of the existence of the
</p>
<p>Secret Plan, of which I had received accounts from
</p>
<p>many of my friends in Geneva. Their esteem and
</p>
<p>affection for M. Leone were of a very warm nature.
</p>
<p>They spoke of him in terms that excluded all suspicion
</p>
<p>of fraud. The objects too of his constant studies, the
</p>
<p>elevation of his ideas, and his religious labours in the
</p>
<p>Edificateur, indicated a man of serious character, loving
</p>
<p>goodness, and pursuing truth with natural and sincere
</p>
<p>ardour. Notwithstanding all these grounds for a favour
</p>
<p>able prejudice, I confess that I could not bring myself
</p>
<p>to believe what had been told me of the Jesuit

<p>Conference. b
</p>
<p>EDITORS PKEFACB.
</p>
<p>Visiting Geneva in September, 1846, I heard the
</p>
<p>Secret Plan much talked of, and on all hands I received
</p>
<p>the most positive assurances of M. Leone's good faith.
</p>
<p>Among those to whom he had made complete disclo
</p>
<p>sures  and there were a great number of such persons 
</p>
<p>I did not meet with one who was not convinced of the
</p>
<p>authenticity of the Conference, and of the narrator's
</p>
<p>veracity. Nevertheless it was not until I had had
</p>
<p>some very serious conversations with men whose
</p>
<p>perspicacity and good sense it would have been absurd
</p>
<p>in me to disregard  men who had long held intercourse
</p>
<p>with M. Leone, and frequently heard his manuscript
</p>
<p>read  that my incredulity was shaken.
</p>
<p>I felt, indeed, that after all I was infinitely less
</p>
<p>competent to decide in the matter than those whose
</p>
<p>judgment upon it was opposed to mine, and that not
</p>
<p>having seen the documents or conversed with the
</p>
<p>witness, it would have been presumptuous and irra
</p>
<p>tional in me to settle dogmatically that they were
</p>
<p>wrong and that I was right. I therefore suspended
</p>
<p>my judgment, and abstained from forming any positive
</p>
<p>opinion on the subject.
</p>
<p>It was in Paris, towards the close of 1846, that I
</p>
<p>first saw M. Leone. I scarcely spoke to him about his
</p>
<p>manuscript, for which I was informed he had found a
</p>
<p>publisher. I awaited the appearance of the work tp
</p>
<p>become acquainted with its contents.
</p>
<p>I must confess that at that time I did not believe

</p>
<p>much in the Jesuits, and therefore I was disposed to
</p>
<p>EDIT0B S PEEFACE. ill
</p>
<p>attach but little importance to the publication of the-
</p>
<p>Conference. It had always struck me that the public
</p>
<p>did the Jesuits too much honour in giving themselves
</p>
<p>so much concern about them. I believed indeed that
</p>
<p>the order was deeply committed to very retrograde
</p>
<p>ideas, but I did not give it credit for the activity,
</p>
<p>profundity, or Machiavellian ubiquity generally im
</p>
<p>puted to it. In a word, to use a phrase that accurately
</p>
<p>expresses what I then thought, I calculated that at least
</p>
<p>a discount of from sixty to eighty per cent should be
</p>
<p>struck offfrom the current estimate respecting the Jesuits.
</p>
<p>As for their obscurantist and retrograde conspiracy,
</p>
<p>I thought it of no more account against the develop
</p>
<p>ment of human progress and liberty, than the barriers
</p>
<p>of sand raised by children against the tides of the
</p>
<p>ocean. And even now, though enlightened as to the
</p>
<p>character and intrinsic power of the celebrated Com
</p>
<p>pany, I still persist in that opinion ; for, however strong
</p>
<p>the arms that raise it, the anti-democratic barrier is still
</p>
<p>but a rampart of shifting sand, incapable of stopping
</p>
<p>the rising tide : at most it can but trouble the clear
</p>
<p>ness of the foremost waves. II.
</p>
<p>By-and-bye M. Leone was a more frequent atten
</p>
<p>dant at our weekly conversations on Wednesday at the
</p>
<p>office of the Democratie Pacijique. He spoke to me
</p>
<p>of a work on which he was engaged, and appointed a

</p>
<p>day on which to read me a copious exposition of the
</p>
<p>IV EDITOE S PEEFACE.
</p>
<p>argument. I listened to it with the liveliest interest,
</p>
<p>and was deeply impressed by its contents. They re
</p>
<p>lated to the publication of extremely important docu
</p>
<p>ments, stamped with the highest ecclesiastical sanction,
</p>
<p>absolutely authentic beyond all cavil, and formed to
</p>
<p>shatter the coarse and oppressive carapace of the
</p>
<p>Catholic Theocracy,* and place in the most shining
</p>
<p>light the democratic and humanitary Christianity of
</p>
<p>the gospel, and the fathers of the first three centuries.
</p>
<p>It is the lamp that sets fire to the bushel.
</p>
<p>The publication of this work, resting on the most
</p>
<p>solid bases, and of a theoretic value altogether superior,
</p>
<p>appeared to me most important. The Introduction
</p>
<p>* Theocracy. Excepting the rigorously defined terms used in
</p>
<p>mathematics, almost all words in the language have very diverse
</p>
<p>meanings ; yet with good faith and some intelligence a mutual under
</p>
<p>standing is always possible.
</p>
<p>But to avoid every false interpretation of the word Theocracy, which
</p>
<p>occurs frequently in the preface, I declare that both therein, and in the
</p>
<p>rest of the work, it is employed in its historical signification, and not
</p>
<p>at all in its grand and beautiful etymological sense.
</p>
<p>Theocracy, in its historical import, is the usurpation of the tem
</p>
<p>poral government by a caste or sacerdotal body, separated from the
</p>
<p>people, and exercising political, social, and religious despotism. For
</p>
<p>this Theocracy religion is but a means, domination is the end.
</p>
<p>The etymological meaning of the same word is, on the contrary, the
</p>
<p>government of God, the coming of that reign of God, which Jesus com
</p>
<p>mands us to pray for to our heavenly Father, and to establish amongst
</p>
<p>us ; that is to say, the ideal of government here below  democracy, evan
</p>
<p>gelically, harmoniously, and religiously organised. In this sense, far
</p>
<p>from repudiating Theocracy, no one would desire it more ardently

</p>
<p>was complete, and was about to be published separately
</p>
<p>in one volume, for which I was making the necessary
</p>
<p>corrections, when Leone received from one of our
</p>
<p>common friends in Geneva intelligence of a breach of
</p>
<p>confidence committed by his copyist, and the advertise
</p>
<p>ment of the approaching publication of the Secret
</p>
<p>Plan in Berne.
</p>
<p>On receiving this news, the details of which are
</p>
<p>given in the subsequent introduction, Leone changed
</p>
<p>his plans. He begged me to lay aside the first work,
</p>
<p>and immediately publish the Secret Plan in Paris, so
</p>
<p>as if possible to anticipate the necessarily faulty, trun
</p>
<p>cated, and wholly unsubstantiated edition that was about
</p>
<p>to appear in Switzerland. But the notice he had
</p>
<p>received was too late, and ere long he had in his hands
</p>
<p>a copy of a bad edition, containing a part only of his
</p>
<p>MS., printed at Berne, without name or testimonial,
</p>
<p>and which in its anonymous garb  the livery of shame
</p>
<p> did not and could not obtain any general notice.
</p>
<p>Thenceforth Leone's solicitude was not so much to
</p>
<p>hasten as to perfect the publication which was already
</p>
<p>in the press, and to make the third part (corroborative
</p>
<p>proofs), which is entirely wanting in the Berne edition,
</p>
<p>as complete as circumstances could require or allow.
</p>
<p>III.
</p>
<p>At that period there no longer remained any doubt
</p>
<p>in my mind as to the authenticity of the Secret
</p>
<p>Conference and Leone's sincerity.

</p>
<p>To suppose that his story was a romance, the Con
</p>
<p>ference a lying fabrication, and that Leone made me at
</p>
<p>once the dupe and the accomplice of a calumnious hoax,
</p>
<p>it would be necessary to esteem him the vilest and most
</p>
<p>despicable of men, considering the mutual relations
</p>
<p>that had grown up between us. But those relations
</p>
<p>had fully justified in my eyes the high estimate which
</p>
<p>our common friends in Geneva, who had known him
</p>
<p>long and intimately, had formed of his integrity, high-
</p>
<p>mindedness, and goodness of soul. I therefore declare,
</p>
<p>that if the circumstances detailed in the following
</p>
<p>narrative present to the reader's eyes an extraordinary
</p>
<p>character and a romantic appearance, calculated to
</p>
<p>stagger his belief, I for my part would regard as a still
</p>
<p>more inexplicable mystery, the quantum of baseness,
</p>
<p>and the power of fraud, which Leone must have been
</p>
<p>endowed with, in order so long to beguile the attached
</p>
<p>friends he had found in Geneva and Paris. Leone
</p>
<p>has given us such strong positive proofs of disinterested
</p>
<p>ness, single-minded sincerity, and incapacity to play
</p>
<p>an assumed part, that far from ascribing to him the
</p>
<p>faculty of mystifying and duping others, those who
</p>
<p>know him see in him, along with an unswerving
</p>
<p>devotedness to principle and truth, one of those natures
</p>
<p>which, while they preserve in mature age the confi
</p>
<p>ding simplicity and sensibility of early youth, are
</p>
<p>much rather themselves exposed to be deceived

</p>
<p>But the guarantees afforded by the character of the
</p>
<p>witness are not the only motives that have convinced
</p>
<p>me of the authenticity of his testimony. Thousands
</p>
<p>of proofs, incidents of conversation, questions put at
</p>
<p>long intervals on delicate points, and imperceptible
</p>
<p>circumstances of the drama, have always resulted in an
</p>
<p>agreement so exact, positive, and formal, that truth
</p>
<p>alone could produce such perfect coaptation. One
</p>
<p>example will be sufficient to explain the nature of the
</p>
<p>proofs I am now alluding to.
</p>
<p>Among other points in the narrative, it had struck
</p>
<p>me as an extraordinary and quite romantic circumstance,
</p>
<p>that, when the young neophyte entered the rector's
</p>
<p>apartment in the convent of Chieri, and took for
</p>
<p>his amusement a book from one of the library shelves,
</p>
<p>he should have found in the very first instance, behind
</p>
<p>the very first book he laid his hand on, the registry of
</p>
<p>the Confessions of the Novices, and again, immediately
</p>
<p>behind it, that of the Confessions of Strangers, and
</p>
<p>the rest. I had often reflected on the singularly sur
</p>
<p>prising nature of this chance, and I had intended to
</p>
<p>mention my perplexity on this subject to Leone. Now
</p>
<p>it happened one morning while I was writing, and
</p>
<p>while he was conversing near me with other persons
</p>
<p>to whom he was relating his adventure, I heard him
</p>
<p>say, in the course of a narrative delivered with all the

</p>
<p>precision of a very lively recollection, "I laid my
</p>
<p>EDITOE S PEEFACE.
</p>
<p>hand on the first book on the library shelf." This
</p>
<p>trivial detail, which was not in the first manuscript,
</p>
<p>and which Leone thus gave, unasked for, in the course
</p>
<p>of a recital the animation of which vividly recalled the
</p>
<p>scene to his memory and made him describe all its
</p>
<p>circumstances, explained to me in the most natural
</p>
<p>and satisfactory manner a thing which had previously
</p>
<p>appeared to me in the light, not indeed of an impossi
</p>
<p>bility, but of a serious improbability.
</p>
<p>This example is enough to show the nature of the
</p>
<p>countefproofs I have mentioned ; and so great a num
</p>
<p>ber of similar ones have occurred to me, in the infinite
</p>
<p>turns and changes of conversation, during the four or
</p>
<p>five months I have been led to apply myself, often for
</p>
<p>several hours daily, to the correction of Leone's manu
</p>
<p>script and proofs, that for my own part, independently
</p>
<p>of the arguments drawn from the character of the
</p>
<p>man, they are enough to erase from my mind all
</p>
<p>doubt as to the veracity of his tale. The utmost skill
</p>
<p>in lying could not produce a tissue always perfectly
</p>
<p>smooth in its most delicate interruptions. Imagination
</p>
<p>may, no doubt, very ingeniously arrange the plot and
</p>
<p>details of a fiction ; but if at long intervals, in the
</p>
<p>thousand turns of conversation, and without letting
</p>
<p>the author perceive your drift, you make him talk at
</p>
<p>random of all the details which the story suggests,
</p>
<p>then certainly if the web is spurious you will discover
</p>
<p>many a broken thread. Now, this web of Leone's I

</p>
<p>have examined with a microscope for months together
</p>
<p>EDITOE S PEEFACE. ix
</p>
<p>in every part, and I have not been able to detect in it
</p>
<p>one broken thread or one knot. I have no doubt,
</p>
<p>therefore, if the authenticity of the narrative become
</p>
<p>the subject of serious discussion, that the narrator will
</p>
<p>rise victorious over every difficulty that can be raised
</p>
<p>up against him ; for I do not think that he can encoun
</p>
<p>ter any stronger or more numerous than I myself and
</p>
<p>some of my friends have directly or indirectly set
</p>
<p>before him. V.
</p>
<p>I will now examine considerations of a third kind,
</p>
<p>which have this advantage over the preceding ones,
</p>
<p>that they can be directly appreciated by everybody 
</p>
<p>for they are derived from internal evidence.
</p>
<p>I say, without hesitation, that to me it is not
</p>
<p>matter of doubt that every cool impartial person, who
</p>
<p>has some experience of the affairs of life and of litera
</p>
<p>ture, and who shall have read very attentively the
</p>
<p>speeches in the Secret Conference, will recognise in
</p>
<p>them the distinct stamp of reality.
</p>
<p>It seems evident to me that these speeches cannot
</p>
<p>be the produce of a literary artist's imagination : the
</p>
<p>imitation of nature is not to be carried to such a pitch.
</p>
<p>Certainly, it is not a young man, a young Piedmontese
</p>
<p>priest, though endowed with talent, sensibility, ima
</p>
<p>gination, and good sense, who could have produced
</p>
<p>such a work. To this day, though his intellect is

<p>much more mature and his acquirements considerably
</p>
<p>EDITOE S PEEFACE.
</p>
<p>enlarged, I do not hesitate to declare Leone quite
</p>
<p>incapable of composing such a piece. I go further
</p>
<p>and assert, that there is not one among all the living
</p>

</p>
<p>VII.
</p>
<p>I am not the only person who has remarked a
</p>
<p>strange form that frequently recurs in the speeches of
</p>
<p>the reverend fathers of the Secret Conference, namely
</p>
<p>those harangues to imaginary auditors, of which they
</p>
<p>almost all present specimens, or fragments, in their
</p>
<p>addresses to their colleagues. There are some to
</p>
<p>whom this form seems extraordinary and unnatural-
</p>
<p>Extraordinary I own it is, but as to its being unnatural,
</p>
<p>the circumstances and the men considered, I am quite
</p>
<p>of the opposite opinion.
</p>
<p>Men who for fifteen, twenty, or thirty years, more
</p>
<p>or less, have been in the daily practice of public
</p>
<p>speaking, whose incessant task is proselytism, the
</p>
<p>seduction of consciences, the propagation of their
</p>
<p>policy, the conquest of souls, and who when met
</p>
<p>together to concert and mutually make known their
</p>
<p>means of action and their modes of proceeding, are
</p>
<p>glad to display each his own individual skill, such
</p>
<p>men would naturally have recourse to the form of
</p>
<p>communication in question. On reflection, then, it is
</p>
<p>evident that this singularity is perfectly natural in the

<p>special case in which it occurs. The more improbable

<p>EDITOE S PEEFACE.
</p>
<p>it seems in an abstract point of view, the more strongly
</p>
<p>does it argue in favour of the authenticity of the
</p>
<p>Conference; for most assuredly the idea of putting all
</p>
<p>those numerous harangues into the mouths of the
</p>
<p>reverend fathers would never have occurred spon
</p>
<p>taneously to one who should have sat down to
</p>
<p>compose a fiction. The thing is one of those which
</p>
<p>we can account for when they are done, but which
</p>
<p>we can hardly imagine beforehand. Leone himself has
</p>
<p>never, so far as I am aware, given the explanation of
</p>
<p>the matter which to me appears so simple. The answer
</p>
<p>I have heard him return to objections of this kind has
</p>
<p>always been, " I can only say that the thing was so."
</p>
<p>VIII.
</p>
<p>It certainly cannot be said that there are not, in
</p>
<p>the preliminary narrative, or in the Conference itself,
</p>
<p>points as to which Leone has clearly perceived the
</p>
<p>difficulty of overcoming public incredulity. He has
</p>
<p>even debated with himself whether he should not
</p>
<p>suppress certain passages of the conference, knowing
</p>
<p>very well that they would prove stumbling-blocks,
</p>
<p>and that many persons refusing to believe them, might
</p>
<p>very probably reject all the rest along with them.
</p>
<p>Finally he resolved to set down everything he had
</p>
<p>heard with the most scrupulous fidelity, and in my
</p>
<p>opinion the has herein done wisely, notwithstanding the
</p>
<p>inconveniences resulting from such a course. Sound

<p>critics will see in the fact an additional evidence of
</p>
<p>EDITOE S PEEFACE. Xvii
</p>
<p>truth. They will say to themselves that were Leone
</p>
<p>an author instead of a narrator, he would have taken
</p>
<p>good care not to leave in a work, not hastily put forth,
</p>
<p>matters which he must have been well aware would
</p>
<p>appear incredible.
</p>
<p>In like manner, if his story of the circumstances
</p>
<p>by which the Secret Conference was disclosed to him
</p>
<p>were a fiction, would it not have been very easy to
</p>
<p>make that fiction more probable ? Tale for tale, there
</p>
<p>might have been devised a score that on the whole
</p>
<p>would have been much simpler and would have pre
</p>
<p>sented much fewer of those apparent difficulties on
</p>
<p>which common objectors tenaciously fasten. No ; and
</p>
<p>as Leone is far from being a fool, I say (and for proof
</p>
<p>I might appeal to circumstances, such as the daring
</p>
<p>resolution he adopted at the very moment when he
</p>
<p>had been panic-stricken by a danger that still hung
</p>
<p>over him, and which he himself describes to satiety;
</p>
<p>the almost literally exact stenography of the conference ;
</p>
<p>the accumulation in so brief a space of time of the
</p>
<p>two revelations, that of the secret books in the library,
</p>
<p>and that of the speeches of the reverend fathers,
</p>
<p>&c, &c), I say for my part, instead of the veracity
</p>
<p>of the story being impugned by its improbability, that
</p>
<p>very improbability is a pledge of veracity:

</p>
<p>periods which have reference to the event of which
</p>
<p>he speaks. It is incontestible that he entered the
</p>
<p>monastery of Chieri with an extremely ardent, fixed,
</p>
<p>and profound determination ; that he desired nothing
</p>
<p>so much as to become a Jesuit ; that hopes had already
</p>
<p>been held out to him which could not but have whetted
</p>
<p>his desires ; and that all at once, without any ascertained
</p>
<p>motive, he was seen, to the great amazement of every
</p>
<p>body, flying from that monastery into which he had
</p>
<p>so eagerly desired admittance two months before, and
</p>
<p>where he had met with nothing but kindness, favour,
</p>
<p>and all sorts of winning treatment. It is certain, then,
</p>
<p>that he received some terrible shock in the monastery.
</p>
<p>The fact is attested by his flight, his subsequent illness,
</p>
<p>and his sudden abandonment of that Jesuit career
</p>
<p>which had been so much the object of his ambition,
</p>
<p>while at the same time he did not quit the clerical pro
</p>
<p>fession. This mysterious revolution, the meaning of
</p>
<p>which he could not then explain to any one of his
</p>
<p>friends or relations, and of which his old mother, who
</p>
<p>now lives in Paris, did not know the cause until the

<p>death of the head of the family allowed Leone to quit
</p>
<p>Piedmont  this revolution was certainly the effect
</p>
<p>of some extraordinary and formidable adventure, some
</p>
<p>sudden revelation, some appalling burst of light ; for
</p>
<p>him, whom it had befallen, it was decisive of the whole
</p>
<p>bent of his life, and made the study of all that per

<p>tains to Jesuitism thenceforth his principal occupation.

</p>
<p>which form in the narrative the envelope, as it were,
</p>
<p>to the Secret Conference, are of public notoriety
</p>
<p>in Leone's native land, and he narrates them
</p>
<p>publicly, mentioning names, places, dates, facts, and
</p>
<p>persons. Something most extraordinary, unknown to
</p>
<p>the Jesuits themselves, who were unable to account
</p>
<p>for his flight, must have perturbed his being, altered
</p>
<p>his health, and effected a total change in the bent of
</p>
<p>his mind and his ideas ; and for my part I doubt not
</p>
<p>that the publication now made by Leone, is the true
</p>
<p>and sincere explanation of that mysterious point.
</p>
<p>X.
</p>
<p>I will now say a word as to my co-operation in
</p>
<p>Leone's publication, because, independently of what I
</p>
<p>have already made known, there was in this matter
</p>
<p>a circumstance which has strongly corroborated my
</p>
<p>conviction. Leone as yet writes French but very imperfectly,
</p>
<p>so that I have been obliged to revise his whole manu
</p>
<p>script, pen in hand, before sending it to press. Now
</p>
<p>I found an enormous difference as to style between
</p>
<p>the second part and the others. In the Secret Con
</p>
<p>ference Leone was supported by the text, and often by
</p>
<p>the solidity of the speeches, which he had only to
</p>
<p>translate, and here he left me hardly anything to
</p>
<p>correct ; whenever there was any awkwardness or
</p>
<p>ambiguity of expression, I had only to turn to the

</p>
<p>Italian text and find a more exact translation for the
</p>
<p>EDITOE S PEEFACE.
</p>
<p>passage. In this part of the work his French manu
</p>
<p>script has only undergone slight modifications in a
</p>
<p>few passages.
</p>
<p>In the other two parts (the first especially, for the
</p>
<p>third consists chiefly of extracts), I have had much
</p>
<p>more to do than I could have wished, and frequently
</p>
<p>whole pages to rewrite completely. The difference
</p>
<p>was so marked that it was impossible for me to retain
</p>
<p>the least doubt as to the duality of the sources whence
</p>
<p>it arose ; and notwithstanding our conjoint labour,
</p>
<p>there still remains such a discrepancy between Leone's
</p>
<p>style and that of the Secret Conference, that the least
</p>
<p>observant reader will easily recognise a diversity of
</p>
<p>origin. As an example, I will particularly invite atten
</p>
<p>tion to the reflection with which Leone closes the con
</p>
<p>ference, and which begins thus (see end of the second
</p>
<p>part), " By these words, the echo and confirmation
</p>
<p>of others not less presumptous." When we came to
</p>
<p>this passage in the course of our revision, Leone said
</p>
<p>to me, "Is it worth while, think you, to let that
</p>
<p>reflection stand?" "By all means, my dear friend,"
</p>
<p>I replied with a smile, "let it stand. We must not
</p>
<p>think of suppressing this precious naif reflection with
</p>
<p>which you, as a narrator, have quite naturally closed
</p>
<p>your report of the conference. There is, if you will
</p>
<p>allow me to say so, between your summing up and
</p>
<p>that of the president, paragraphs xix. and xxi., which
</p>
<p>precedes it, so enormous, so colossal a difference, that

<p>I know no more glaring proof of the authenticity of
</p>
<p>EDITOE S PEEFACE.
</p>
<p>the conference, and of the impossibility of your being
</p>
<p>its author. How pale and weak is what you say in
</p>
<p>comparison with the language of the general of the
</p>
<p>the Order ! How much does the expression of your
</p>
<p>sentiments on Jesuit ambition sink below the Word of
</p>
<p>the Company, the living incarnation of that ambition ?
</p>
<p>The contrast seems to me so important, that far from
</p>
<p>suppressing your lines, you must forthwith grant me
</p>
<p>permission to repeat to the reader what I have just
</p>
<p>been saying to you."
</p>
<p>And indeed whoever compares the grandiloquent
</p>
<p>language of paragraph xix. and the concluding words
</p>
<p>of paragraph xxi., with Leone's final reflection, will, I
</p>
<p>think, admit with me that the latter is merely a nar
</p>
<p>rator, and will own how far external passion, if I may
</p>
<p>be allowed the expression, falls short of internal
</p>
<p>passion in the expression of a sentiment. To body
</p>
<p>forth the theocratic will and purpose with those traits
</p>
<p>of fire that flash every moment from the pen of De
</p>
<p>Maistre, and often from the lips of the fathers of the
</p>
<p>Secret Conference, the writer must himself have raised
</p>
<p>an altar to theocracy in his soul, and have long
</p>
<p>kept up, upon that inward altar, the sombre fire its
</p>
<p>worship demands. Although it does not always show

<p>with equal brilliancy throughout the conference, every

</p>
<p>the circumstances of his story, and my study of the
</p>
<p>subject in itself, have left no doubt upon my mind as
</p>
<p>to the authenticity of the revelation, and I declare,
</p>
<p>on my soul and conscience, that I believe Leone
</p>
<p>TO BE PERFECTLY FAITHFUL AND SINCERE.
</p>
<p>Now, whereas I should deem it odious to make use,
</p>
<p>even against Jesuitism, of fraud and calumny, I have
</p>
<p>held it no less obligatory upon me, in the actual state of
</p>
<p>tilings, convinced as I am of the reality of the Jesuit
</p>
<p>plan, to assist Leone, who had been unable to find a
</p>
<p>publisher, in laying it before the public. This seemed
</p>
<p>to me a personal and conscientious duty.
</p>
<p>When I came to the determination to edit the
</p>
<p>manuscript, the Jesuits were exhibiting in Switzerland
</p>
<p>what they were capable of. They tried every means
</p>
<p>to bring about there an intervention of the anti-liberal
</p>
<p>powers  a coalition into which the French government
</p>
<p>monstrously entered. Instead of conjuring civil war by
</p>
<p>a voluntary retreat, those pretended disciples of Jesus
</p>
<p>were seen artfully kindling the fanaticism and rancour
</p>
<p>of the abused populations of the Sonderbund, and doing
</p>
<p>all in their power to provoke a bloody conflict. Their

<p>aim was to recover, by means of an intervention, the
</p>
<p>EDITOE S PEEFACE. XXlli
</p>
<p>ground taken from them in the cantons and the diet
</p>
<p>by the progress of free ideas. They spared no effort
</p>
<p>to produce that odious result, which happily they
</p>
<p>failed to accomplish.
</p>
<p>Moreover, it is well known what has been and
</p>
<p>what is still the part played by them in Rome, and
</p>
<p>what a weighty obstacle they are to the liberal inten
</p>
<p>tions of the great Pontiff, who at every step in advance
</p>
<p>encounters their occult and potent influence. The
</p>
<p>publication of the Secret Plan will serve to unmask
</p>
<p>them. Their whole strength consists in the mystery
</p>
<p>in which they shroud themselves ; let their projects be
</p>
<p>exposed to daylight, and the charm will be broken.
</p>
<p>These darksome and malignant associations are like
</p>
<p>the phantoms of the night that vanish the moment they
</p>
<p>are touched by one ray of sunshine.
</p>
<p>I have said wherefore, and how, I came to take upon
</p>
<p>me the editing of this book, although certain of Leone's
</p>
<p>tendencies are not always perfectly in accordance with
</p>
<p>mine. The main thing for me in this matter has been
</p>
<p>to aid in unveiling that odious conspiracy (in which
</p>
<p>many still hesitate to believe, and I own that I was
</p>
<p>for a long time among the number) which has for its
</p>
<p>defined and specific end the re -establishment of dark
</p>
<p>ness and despotism, and for its means the deliberate
</p>
<p>and conscious employment of the most abominable of

<p>ference as anything but a romance, cannot at least deny
</p>
<p>EDITOE S PEEFACE.
</p>
<p>that the romance is perfectly historical. The third part
</p>
<p>contains an assemblage of proofs putting this point
</p>
<p>beyond all cavil. The gospel is the code of human
</p>
<p>freedom and dignity ; some would make it a code of
</p>
<p>brutification and slavery, or rather they would stifle
</p>
<p>the rays of light and love that beam from it, and
</p>
<p>substitute a despicable fanaticism for the spiritual and
</p>
<p>democratic religion of Jesus. They will not succeed
</p>
<p>in their design ; but to insure the defeat of the theo
</p>
<p>cratic conspiracy, the friends of progress and freedom
</p>
<p>must bestir themselves.
</p>
<p>Catholicism is a great religious institution. It is
</p>
<p>necessary to the development of that living institu
</p>
<p>tion that the hierarchy which governs it be renovated
</p>
<p>and retempered in the living sources of the gospel.
</p>
<p>The first steps which the pontiff, who now wears the
</p>
<p>tiara, has made in the way of progress and liberty, are
</p>
<p>a capital revelation for Catholicism. To be or not to be.
</p>
<p>Christianity is immortal. A religion which is
</p>
<p>summed up in these words, " Love one another, and
</p>
<p>love God above all things," cannot die out from man
</p>
<p>kind ; for every progress of humanity is but a new
</p>
<p>and fuller unfolding within it of Christianity, that is to
</p>
<p>say of love and liberty. But the future destiny of
</p>
<p>the catholic institution, which is a government, now
</p>
<p>depends, like that of all other governments, on its
</p>
<p>reconciliation with the spirit of the gospel, which is the
</p>
<p>spirit of humanity.

<p>P.S. Paris, May 28th, 1848. Since I wrote the

<p>above Preface to Leone's narrative in London, and
</p>
<p>at the moment when the work was about to appear
</p>
<p>simultaneously in England, France, Belgium, and

<p>Germany, the Revolution of February changed the
</p>
<p>face of things. The party of oppression, favoured by
</p>
<p>the impious alliance of the French government with
</p>
<p>the absolute courts, has been miraculously overthrown ;
</p>
<p>the Jesuits themselves have been expelled from Rome.

<p>Peace, liberty, complete reciprocity ( solidarity J,
</p>
<p>and universal brotherhood, will only be realised by the
</p>
<p>definitive incarnation of the spirit of the Gospel in
</p>
<p>humanity. The work now before us is to make a
</p>
<p>democratic and christian Europe, instead of the aris
</p>
<p>tocratic -and, socially speaking, heathen Europe, which
</p>
<p>was yesterday official and legal. The question is far
</p>
<p>more religious and social than political. It is the era
</p>
<p>of practical Christianity which we are called on to
</p>
<p>inaugurate. Hence, though Leone's publication now no longer
</p>
<p>possesses the character it would have had in the very
</p>
<p>heat of the strife, before the Revolution, it nevertheless
</p>
<p>retains its value. It will serve the good cause by
</p>
<p>exposing the designs of the bad cause ; it will help
</p>
<p>the development of the true Christianity, democratic
</p>
<p>Christianity, by exhibiting in its odious nakedness
</p>
<p>the pseudo Christianity, the Christianity of the profit-
</p>
<p>seekers, of Theocracy, of Despotism.
</p>
<p>The two parties must be accurately segregated : on
</p>
<p>the one side daylight, on the other darkness.

<p>The subordinate clergy, whose condition in France
</p>
<p>is an actual civil, political, and religious thraldom, has
</p>
<p>respired the air of freedom with hope and love. Let
</p>
<p>the Republic give it a democratic constitution  let it
</p>
<p>restore to it the rights and guarantees of which it
</p>
<p>cannot be much longer despoiled  and it will soon

<p>have made its conquest. The subordinate clergy begs

</p>
<p>emancipate the sacerdotal people ; set it free, and the
</p>
<p>oppressive and shameful doctrines of Jesuitism will
</p>
<p>find in it their most formidable antagonist.
</p>
<p>It is time that this be done. It is time that the
</p>
<p>ecclesiastical people communicate with the lay people
</p>
<p>in the sentiments of modern life and modern ideas.
</p>
<p>It is idle now to think of conserving dead interpreta
</p>
<p>tions. Society is athirst for liberty, equality, and
</p>
<p>fraternity : it is time to return to the holy source, and
</p>
<p>recover the liberating import of Christianity.
</p>
<p>Providence had committed an august mission to
</p>
<p>the Church : to perpetuate Christ's teaching, to render
</p>
<p>him for ever living on earth, preciously to preserve
</p>
<p>and to realise daily more and more the gospel principles
</p>
<p>of unity, charity, and universal brotherhood. Instead
</p>
<p>of accomplishing this task, the theocratic spirit has
</p>
<p>striven to efface from the Church the traces of Him
</p>
<p>who had founded it  to filch away the liberal meaning
</p>
<p>of his instructions  to paralyse the intellectual life 
</p>
<p>and, in a word, to make mankind a flock of brutes, to
</p>
<p>be shorn by the Princes of the Church and the Princes
</p>
<p>of the World.
</p>
<p>Disowned, let us hope, by the mass of the clergy,

<p>this theocratic spirit will soon be constrained, finally

<p>and for ever, to give up Europe to the genius of the

<p>repudiate all fellowship with a sect which has led it

<p>ing all truly christian works  that is to say, all works

<p>of social and intellectual amelioration.
</p>
<p>The Revolution of February has opened a magni

<p>ficent field for the Church ; the problem now to be

<p>solved is the Constitution of a Christian

<p>anity been preached to men ;  how to incarnate it in
</p>
<p>society is now the problem. PoHtical society itself

<p>invokes the Gospel formula, taking for its motto those
</p>
<p>three christian words, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity!
</p>
<p>Let the subordinate clergy and the liberal bishops,
</p>
<p>casting off the anti-christian and anti-catholic traditions
</p>
<p>of Jesuitism, press forward, full of faith, hope, and

<p>love, in the path which is opened to them. The'

<p>French citizens, who were republicans of the morrow,
</p>
<p>were about to be governed as conquered populations
</p>
<p>by the republicans of the eve ; all those violences of
</p>
<p>speech and demeanour, which had not even the logic
</p>
<p>of the strong hand in their favour, produced serious
</p>
<p>reactionary ferments in the country. The huge folly
</p>
<p>of postponing the elections considerably diminished the
</p>
<p>democratic element in the National Assembly, which
</p>
<p>instead of feeling itself united, confident, and strong,
</p>
<p>was from the very outset uncertain, distrustful of
</p>
<p>itself, irresolute, and divided.
</p>
<p>Hence the critical situation in which we now behold
</p>
<p>the republic and society.
</p>
<p>A deliberately reactionary party, which would not

<p>have existed, had not its creation and development

<p>been provoked as if on purpose, is rapidly organising.
</p>
<p>It is turning to its own account material interests,

<p>intriguing, of the various dynastic factions and of the

<p>theocratic faction.
</p>
<p>All these elements constitute a formidable coali

<p>tion, in which intrigue is organising the resistance
</p>
<p>of those interests which it can so easily mislead and

<p>Under the monarchy of July it had indeed enlisted

<p>among its allies the official and satisfied bourgeoisie,
</p>
<p>which entered into covenant with it in its retrograde

<p>To-day, a new stratum of French society has passed

<p>INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>I.
</p>
<p>There is no one but has devoted some attention to
</p>
<p>the reappearance of the too famous Company of Jesus
</p>
<p>on the European stage- Many have rejoiced at the
</p>
<p>event ; a greater number have beheld it with deep
</p>
<p>sorrow or irritation.
</p>
<p>To say the truth, there were various reasons why a
</p>
<p>fact of this nature should interest governments and
</p>
<p>nations ; for if ever the aim of that audacious Order
</p>
<p>could be achieved, every right and every liberty would
</p>
<p>be at an end. I do not think I exaggerate in expres
</p>
<p>sing myself thus ; on the contrary, I am strongly
</p>
<p>persuaded that those who read the disclosures made in
</p>
<p>this work will share my opinion.
</p>
<p>Let me be permitted, in the first place, to enter
</p>
<p>into certain personal details, before I proceed to initiate
</p>
<p>the public into the secret I am about to divulge. I
</p>
<p>will be as brief as possible.
</p>
<p>In 1838, I voluntarily quitted Piedmont, my

</p>
<p>native country, went to Switzerland, and settled in
</p>
<p>TNTBODDCTION.
</p>
<p>Geneva. At that period nothing yet presaged the
</p>
<p>ascendancy which the Jesuits were soon to obtain in
</p>
<p>the affairs of that republic, and the troubles in which
</p>
<p>their intrigues were to involve various other parts of
</p>
<p>Europe. Yet I did not hesitate to say openly to a
</p>
<p>great number of persons what there was to be appre
</p>
<p>hended in that way. I was not believed. My
</p>
<p>predictions were universally regarded as dreams. In
</p>
<p>vain I repeated to them that I possessed proofs of the
</p>
<p>invisible snares and most secret projects of the Com
</p>
<p>pany. A contemptuous smile was the answer to my
</p>
<p>words. Gradually the face of events was changed, and the
</p>
<p>first symptoms of the Jesuit influence began to show
</p>
<p>themselves in Prussia.
</p>
<p>Every one knows the commotion caused by the
</p>
<p>question of mixed marriages raised by the Archbishop
</p>
<p>of Cologne, and his ultramontane pretensions. A
</p>
<p>powerful party, and celebrated writers, Gorres among
</p>
<p>the rest, declared themselves the prelate's supporters,
</p>
<p>and undertook the defence of doctrines which had
</p>
<p>long been considered dead. At the same period,
</p>
<p>pompous announcements were made of the conversion
</p>

<p>Mr. Hare, an Anglican clergyman, when a number
</p>
<p>IKTEODUCTION. XXXV
</p>
<p>of distinguished foreigners were present. The con
</p>
<p>versation ran exclusively upon the subject of these
</p>
<p>brilliant conquests, and everybody strove to invent
</p>
<p>some hypothesis on which to explain them. From
</p>
<p>what was stated of several of the converts by those
</p>
<p>who knew them personally, it was inferred that the
</p>
<p>real motive of their change was not precisely of a
</p>
<p>religious nature. I declared that the conjecture was
</p>
<p>not erroneous ; and I was thus led to lay before the
</p>
<p>company present the course of circumstances through
</p>
<p>which I had become in a manner an initiated
</p>
<p>Jesuit. A person who took part in the conversation, and
</p>
<p>who was travelling under the title of count, expressed
</p>
<p>a strong desire to see some portion of the Secret
</p>
<p>Plan, which had been mentioned. At his request, I
</p>
<p>called on him next day, and read him certain pages of
</p>
<p>the manuscript. He listened with great attention,
</p>
<p>seemed very much struck by some passages, and
</p>
<p>owned to me that at last he could explain to himself
</p>
<p>many enigmas. He asked me to let him keep the
</p>
<p>manuscript for a day, in order that he might study it
</p>
<p>more at leisure. This I declined ; and then he made
</p>
<p>known his name. He was a prince nearly related to
</p>
<p>the royal house of Prussia. I persisted, nevertheless,
</p>
<p>in my refusal, though he offered me his support, and
</p>
<p>even made me some tempting promises.

<p>The prince, somewhat to my surprise, requested
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>me to give him a French version of the Secret Plan,
</p>
<p>that he might, as he said, have it translated into
</p>
<p>German. He recommended me to observe the greatest
</p>
<p>discretion, and insisted that I should not compromise
</p>
<p>his name. I was to deal only with his son's tutor on
</p>
<p>the subject. Furthermore, it was arranged that I
</p>
<p>should subjoin an essay on the question pending
</p>
<p>between the cabinet of Prussia and the Holy See,
</p>
<p>wherein I was to demonstrate that the attempts made
</p>
<p>by various prelates, especially their attacks upon the
</p>
<p>university system of education, and their growing
</p>
<p>audacity in enforcing the old maxims of Rome, were
</p>
<p>not a purely local and fortuitous manifestation, but a
</p>
<p>fact closely connected with a vast conspiracy, pregnant
</p>
<p>with danger to all the powers.
</p>
<p>I set to work, and wrote an account of all the
</p>
<p>strange incidents through which I had become an
</p>
<p>invisible witness of the occult committee in which the
</p>
<p>Jesuit plot was concocted. As soon as I had finished
</p>
<p>the translation of the plan itself, which I sent off by
</p>
<p>instalments, and just as I was about to enter on the
</p>
<p>conclusion, I was desired to stop short  the pretext
</p>
<p>alleged being the death of the King of Prussia, which
</p>
<p>had just occurred. I had even a good deal of trouble
</p>
<p>to recover the copy I had sent.
</p>
<p>I was soon surrounded with people who obtruded
</p>
<p>their advice upon me ; telling me, that if aid was not

</p>
<p>afforded me towards publishing, it was for my own
</p>
<p>INTEODUCTION. XXXvii
</p>
<p>sake it was withheld ; that I ought to beware how I
</p>
<p>braved a society known to be implacable  a society
</p>
<p>that had smitten kings. " Who are you," they said to
</p>
<p>me, " to cope with such a power, and not fear its
</p>
<p>numerous satellites?" Then, gliding into another
</p>
<p>order of considerations, they would say, " Nothing
</p>
<p>can be more dangerous than to initiate the people into
</p>
<p>such mysteries. It is enough that they should be
</p>
<p>known to those whose position authorises and enjoins
</p>
<p>them to frustrate an ambition, which is the more
</p>
<p>enterprising and mischievous inasmuch as religion and
</p>
<p>blind multitudes serve it as auxiliaries."
</p>
<p>These observations would have had less influence
</p>
<p>over me, had they not derived weight from the
</p>
<p>increasing anxieties of an aged and timid mother.
</p>
<p>Besides, my existence then depended on families who
</p>
<p>would have been deeply offended , by a publication of
</p>
<p>such a nature. All this embarrassed my projects; and
</p>
<p>eager as I had been on my arrival to send the Secret
</p>
<p>Plan of the Jesuits to press, my many disappointments
</p>
<p>led me to postpone its publication indefinitely, though
</p>
<p>I could not conceal my disgust and despondency.
</p>
<p>During all this time the influence of the Jesuits
</p>
<p>had augmented, and the liberals were beginning to
</p>
<p>regard it with apprehension. People came to me with
</p>
<p>all sorts of solicitations ; and so, notwithstanding my
</p>
<p>many disappointments, I was constrained, in a manner,
</p>
<p>by events and entreaties, again to make ready for the
</p>

</p>
<p>INTEODDOTION.
</p>
<p>But other obstacles again delayed it, for everything
</p>
<p>seemed to conspire against an enterprise for which, in
</p>
<p>a great measure, I had voluntarily expatriated myself.
</p>
<p>The persons with whom I had come in contact for this
</p>
<p>business sought only their own interest, and wished to
</p>
<p>place me in such a position as would have entailed on
</p>
<p>me all the annoyances and dangers of the publication
</p>
<p>without any of its advantages.
</p>
<p>The Genevese government increased my perplexities
</p>
<p>by its persecutions. That government of doctrinaires,
</p>
<p>or Protestant Jesuits, so deservedly overthrown last
</p>
<p>year, conducted itself on narrow, egotistical principles,
</p>
<p>and was particularly captious towards strangers. I
</p>
<p>was several times summoned before its police on the
</p>
<p>most futile pretexts. Unable to prove anything against
</p>
<p>me, they took upon them to judge my intentions ;
</p>
<p>interpreted my religious and democratic ideas as a
</p>
<p>crime, and strove to intimidate me with threats of dire
</p>
<p>calamities. On my part I ventured to predict for that
</p>
<p>intolerable government a speedy and ignominious fall.
</p>
<p>At last I was ordered to quit the country within the
</p>
<p>briefest space of time, without any cause being assigned
</p>
<p>to justify that arbitrary measure. Thus a final stop
</p>
<p>was put in Switzerland to the publication of my work,
</p>
<p>which had already been rendered so difficult by all the

</p>
<p>obstacles I have mentioned.
</p>
<p>INTEODUCTION.
</p>
<p>II.
</p>
<p>When I came to Paris in 1846 I had no thought
</p>
<p>of making fresh attempts, more especially as I was told
</p>
<p>I should have great difficulty in finding a publisher.
</p>
<p>I applied myself to the composition of a work, now
</p>
<p>in a great measure completed, founded on documents
</p>
<p>of unquestionable authenticity, and which I should
</p>
<p>even have wished to print before the Secret Plan, as
</p>
<p>fitted in every respect, by its important revelations, to
</p>
<p>secure to the latter the most solid basis in oublic
</p>
<p>opinion. But when I was about to publish it, I
</p>
<p>received from Geneva a letter informing me of a
</p>
<p>monstrous abuse of confidence. The person I had
</p>
<p>employed to transcribe my manuscript of the Secret
</p>
<p>Plan had copied it in duplicate. He had put the
</p>
<p>second copy into the hands of a society, which, strange
</p>
<p>to say, had been formed for the express purpose of
</p>
<p>trafficking in this robbery. The excuse they offered
</p>
<p>was, that since I had during so many years divulged
</p>
<p>the secret plan of the Jesuits, the thing had become
</p>
<p>the property of the public. Moreover, as I had
</p>
<p>transcribed it surreptitiously, it did not belong to me,
</p>
<p>but was free to be used by anybody. It will scarcely
</p>
<p>be believed that the spoiler even went so far as to
</p>
<p>dictate the terms of a bargain to the despoiled, and to
</p>
<p>add irony to impudence, since the work had been

</p>
<p>to be known.*
</p>
<p>What ! the very persons who profess themselves
</p>
<p>such uncompromising enemies of the Jesuits, do not
</p>
<p>themselves refuse to act on the maxim that " the end
</p>
<p>justifies the means." But what has been the result of
</p>
<p>their spohation ? That it has been of no manner of
</p>
<p>advantage to them. What confidence, indeed, would
</p>
<p>there be in a paltry pamphlet, without name or
</p>
<p>warrant for its authenticity? The work, too, they
</p>
<p>published was but a shapeless abortion, a rough draft
</p>
<p>of a translation, very imperfectly collated with the
</p>
<p>* Here it is :  "Geneva, Sept. 7, 1847.
</p>
<p>"Sir, " After having so long played with us, it is extremely
</p>
<p>surprising that you now protest against the publication of a work
</p>
<p>containing essentially the disclosure of speeches captured without
</p>
<p>permission by your ears, or rather by your eyes, in 1824.
</p>
<p>" This protest is the more astonishing after your having yourself
</p>
<p>communicated those speeches to hundreds of persons, so as to make
</p>
<p>them be regarded as common property.
</p>
<p>" Though I consider your protest as insignificant, and as a thing
</p>
<p>which at most can only result in giving you trouble and making you
</p>
<p>spend money uselessly, yet on the other hand, since my object has
</p>
<p>been attained, and since it is from public motives and not for any
</p>
<p>private interest that I have done so, I now offer to treat with you on the
</p>
<p>following terms :  In case you desire to become the proprietor of this

<p>publication, I consent thereto, on condition that you immediately

<p>furnish the necessary securities for the complete payment of the printer

</p>
<p>correct, and swarming with mistakes. The edition I
</p>
<p>put forth is rigorously exact and scrupulous ; I have
</p>
<p>long and minutely scrutinized it, and it has been re-
</p>
<p>corrected under the eye of guides who have helped me
</p>
<p>to convey in French the full force of the original,
</p>
<p>which is often hard to translate. I have subjoined to
</p>
<p>the Secret Plan elucidations of great importance, and
</p>
<p>I have related the circumstances through which it has
</p>
<p>come into my possession. Finally, I have brought
</p>
<p>forward counterproofs of various kinds, all drawn from
</p>
<p>authentic sources, in support of the essential views and
</p>
<p>ideas developed in the plan.
</p>
<p>The publication put forth by my spoliators is the
</p>
<p>more blamable, inasmuch as the manner of its execu

<p>tion has been such as to compromise the fundamental

<p>document. For, I repeat, what authority can it have
</p>
<p>without my co-operation, without my name, and the
</p>
<p>corroborative proofs that accompany it in the present
</p>
<p>volume ? Is it not a culpable and shameful act to
</p>
<p>put in jeopardy a matter of such moment? If they
</p>
<p>were actuated by no sordid motives, why did they not
</p>
<p>apply to me, and offer me the means of giving publicity
</p>
<p>to my manuscript in the way necessary to secure its
</p>
<p>full effect ? In acting with such bad faith, did they not
</p>
<p>expose themselves to see the blow they designed for
</p>
<p>Jesuitism turned back upon them to their confusion ?
</p>
<p>What was to prevent me from annihilating the result of

<p>their manoeuvre ? Was it not in my power utterly to

<p>discredit the story, by attributing it to a freak of my
</p>
<p>youth? I will say more. What they have done has put
</p>
<p>me in a position, from which it rested only with
</p>
<p>myself to derive profit, by proving by letters, ante-dated
</p>
<p>a few years, that my design had been to play off a
</p>
<p>hoax. III.
</p>
<p>Those who have at all reflected on the Order of the
</p>
<p>Jesuits, who have studied its history, and have had a
</p>
<p>near view of its workings, will by no means be surprised
</p>
<p>at its profound artifices and superb hopes. Do we not
</p>
<p>see it at this moment in France become the guide of
</p>
<p>the bishops, and giving law to the inferior clergy.
</p>
<p>M. Henri Martin thus expresses himself in a remarkable
</p>
<p>work recently published :
</p>
<p>" The clergy, in its collective action, is little more
</p>
<p>than a machine of forty thousand arms, impelled by
</p>
<p>its leaders against whomsoever they please, and those
</p>
<p>leaders themselves are pushed forward by the Jesuit
</p>
<p>and neo-catholic congregations."*
</p>
<p>Well-informed clergymen have assured me that the
</p>
<p>Jesuits were never so well seconded and supported as
</p>
<p>they now are. The establishments dependent on them
</p>
<p>are very numerous, and increase daily. Their resources
</p>
<p>are prodigious. A letter addressed to the Siecle thus
</p>
<p>speaks of their progress. Such a letter serves well to

<p>corroborate what is contained in the Secret Plan. I
</p>
<p>will quote the greater part of it :  *
</p>
<p>" The hill of Fourvieres, which commands Lyons,
</p>
<p>on the right bank of the Saone, is a sort of entrenched
</p>
<p>camp, wherein all the bodies of the clerical militia are
</p>
<p>echelonned, one above the other, in the strongest
</p>
<p>positions ; thence they hold the town in check, like
</p>
<p>those formidable fortresses which have been built to
</p>
<p>intimidate rather than to defend it. The long avenues
</p>
<p>that lead to Fourvieres and the chapel that surmounts
</p>
<p>it, are thronged with images of saints and ex voto ; and
</p>
<p>but for that industrious city which unfolds its moving
</p>
<p>panorama below your feet, you might fancy yourself
</p>
<p>in the midst of the middle ages, and take its factory
</p>
<p>chimneys for convent spires.
</p>
<p>" The exact statistics of the religious establishments
</p>
<p>of Lyons, with the number of their inhabitants and
</p>
<p>the revenues they command, would form a very curious
</p>
<p>book ; but the archbishopric, which possesses all the
</p>
<p>elements of those statistics, is by no means disposed to
</p>
<p>publish them. The clergy, since the severe lessons
</p>
<p>given it by the July event, likes better to be than to
</p>
<p>appear ; its force, disseminated all over France, - and
</p>
<p>not the less real because they do not show themselves ;
</p>
<p>and it can at any moment, as occasion may arise, set
</p>
<p>in motion that huge lever, the extremity of which is
</p>
<p>everywhere, and the fulcrum at Rome.

<p>INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>vital principle that animates it, is the Jesuits. Every
</p>
<p>one knows the well-grounded dislike with which this
</p>
<p>able and dangerous order is regarded from one end of
</p>
<p>Europe to the other. Yet it must be owned that in
</p>
<p>it alone resides all the life of Catholicism at this day ;
</p>
<p>and the clergy would be very ungrateful if they did
</p>
<p>not accept these useful auxiliaries even while they
</p>
<p>fear them.
</p>
<p>" All France knows that famous house in the Rue
</p>
<p>Sala in Lyons, one of the most important centres of
</p>
<p>Jesuitism. At the period of the pretended dispersion
</p>
<p>of the order, that great diplomatic victory in which
</p>
<p>M. le Comte Rossi won his ambassador's spurs, the
</p>
<p>house in the Rue Sala, as well as that in the Rue
</p>
<p>des Postes in Paris, dispersed its inmates for a while,
</p>
<p>either into the neighbouring dioceses, as aide-de-camps
</p>
<p>to the bishops, or as tutors in some noble houses of
</p>
<p>the Place Bellecour ; but when once the farce was
</p>
<p>played out, things returned very quietly to their old
</p>
<p>course, and the Rue Sala, at the moment I write, is
</p>
<p>still with the archbishopric the most active centre of
</p>
<p>politico-religious direction.
</p>
<p>'^That activity is principally directed upon two
</p>
<p>points ; by means of the brotherhoods ( confreries ) it
</p>
<p>reaches the lower classes,- whom the clergy drills and
</p>
<p>holds obedient to it ; by education it gets hold of the
</p>
<p>middle classes, and thus secures to itself the future by
</p>
<p>casting almost a whole generation in the clerical

</p>
<p>mould. Let us begin with the brotherhoods. We
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION. xiv
</p>
<p>will say nothing of those that are not essentially
</p>
<p>Lyonnese, and whose centre is elsewhere, though they
</p>
<p>possess hosts of affiliated dependents here. We will
</p>
<p>merely mention by name the Society for the Propagation
</p>
<p>of the Faith, whose centre, next after Rome, is Lyons,
</p>
<p>and which alone possesses a revenue of four millions
</p>
<p>and a half of francs. But the most important, the
</p>
<p>one which draws its recruits most directly from this
</p>
<p>industrious population, is the Society of St. Francis
</p>
<p>Xavier. Its name sufficiently indicates to what order
</p>
<p>it belongs ; it is Jesuitism put within the reach of the
</p>
<p>labouring classes, and you may recognise it by the
</p>
<p>cleverness of its arrangements. The workmen, of which
</p>
<p>it consists almost exclusively, are disposed in sections
</p>
<p>of tens, hundreds, and thousands, with leaders to each
</p>
<p>section. The avowed purpose of the society is to
</p>
<p>succour invalid workmen, who, for a subscription of
</p>
<p>five sous a-month, or three francs a-year, are insured
</p>
<p>medical aid and twenty-five sous a-day in sickness.
</p>
<p>Such are the outward rules of the society; but in
</p>
<p>reality its design is clerical and legitimist : the two
</p>
<p>influences are here blended together in one common aim.
</p>
<p>" Another and perhaps more dangerous means of
</p>
<p>action is the vast boarding-school which the brethren
</p>
<p>of the Christian schools, under the supreme controul
</p>
<p>of the Rue Sala, have established at Fouvrieres. This
</p>
<p>gigantic establishment,which can accommodate upwards
</p>
<p>of four hundred interns, was founded about eight years

<p>xlvi INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>which is distinct from that of the small seminaries, is
</p>
<p>to give young men of the middle and inferior trading
</p>
<p>classes a sort of professional education, comprising,
</p>
<p>with the exception of the dead languages, all the
</p>
<p>branches taught in colleges. The complete course of
</p>
<p>study embraces no less than eight years. In this
</p>
<p>institution, as in all others of its kind, the domestic

<p>arrangements are excellent, and the instruction in

</p>
<p>fit only to teach little children their catechism, instruct
</p>
<p>adults in the highest branches of rhetoric, philosophy,
</p>
<p>and the physical and mathematical sciences. In con
</p>
<p>sequence, too, of the continual removes of each of the
</p>
<p>brethren of the doctrine to and from all parts of
</p>
<p>France, any able professors who may have been
</p>
<p>formed in Lyons are soon appointed directors in some
</p>
<p>other town ; and the system of teaching in the institu

<p>tion, however high in appearance, does not in reality
</p>
<p>rise above a very humble level.

<p>at Lyons, there was requisite a noviciate house ; and

<p>the order has just procured one, by purchasing for
</p>
<p>250,000 francs a magnificent property at Calvire, within
</p>
<p>a league of Lyons. The vendor allowed ten years for
</p>
<p>the discharge of the purchase money ; but the whole
</p>
<p>was paid within eighteen months ; and a vast edifice,
</p>
<p>capable, when complete, of accommodating more than
</p>
<p>four hundred resident pupils, has risen out of the
</p>
<p>earth as if by enchantment. The estimate made
</p>
<p>by the engineer who directed the works, and who is a

<p>member of the society, amounted, it is said, to a million

<p>and a half of francs, and it has been exceeded.

</p>
<p>we may form an approximate idea of the immense

<p>action on education exercised in these parts by the

<p>the Jesuit schools are supposed to afford their pupils

<p>instruction in all those branches of knowledge, Greek

<p>and Latin included, which are taught in those gulphs

<p>whether for the education of both sexes, or for the
</p>
<p>relief of the distressed. All the suburbs of Lyons
</p>
<p>have their nunneries ; and monastic garbs of every
</p>
<p>form and colour swarm in the streets. The Capuchins,
</p>
<p>however, who were formerly found there, have migrated
</p>
<p>to Yilleurbonne ; and the Jesuits, jealous of any rivals
</p>
<p>of their supremacy here, are said to have purchased
</p>
<p>their retirement at the cost of 900,000 francs.
</p>
<p>" If you are astonished at the immense sums which
</p>
<p>the clergy here dispose of, recollect that one individual,
</p>
<p>Mademoiselle de Labalmondiere, the last scion of a
</p>
<p>noble family, has left the church a sum of ten millions,
</p>
<p>of which the archbishop has been named supreme
</p>
<p>dispenser. Through the confession, by means of the
</p>
<p>women, and by all kinds of influence direct and
</p>
<p>indirect, the clergy keeps the whole male population
</p>
<p>in a state of obsession and blockade. A trader who
</p>
<p>should revolt against this influence would instantly
</p>
<p>provoke against him the whole clerical host, and would
</p>
<p>be stripped of his credit and put under a sort of moral
</p>
<p>interdiction that would end in his ruin. The univer

<p>a brilliant faculty, and an excellent royal college, is put

<p>IV.
</p>
<p>The Jesuits have shown themselves in their true
</p>
<p>colours in Switzerland, where, merciless as ever, they
</p>
<p>chose rather to provoke the horrors of civil war than
</p>
<p>to yield, as the christian spirit enjoined them. They
</p>
<p>have thereby augmented the hatred and contempt '
</p>
<p>with which they are regarded on all sides. So sure
</p>
<p>were they of victory, that in their infatuation they
</p>
<p>disdained to take the most ordinary precautions.
</p>
<p>" Apropos of the Jesuits," said the Swiss correspon
</p>
<p>dent of the National at that period, " it will be well
</p>
<p>to give you some account of the documents which most
</p>
<p>deeply compromised the reverend fathers and their
</p>
<p>allies both in Switzerland and in other countries.
</p>
<p>It will be seen whether or not the presence of the order
</p>
<p>is extremely dangerous to the countries that afford
</p>
<p>them an asylum.
</p>
<p>" In the first place, there has been discovered at
</p>
<p>Fribourg a catalogue in Latin of all the establishments
</p>
<p>which the Jesuits possess in a portion of France and
</p>
<p>Switzerland, with a list and the addresses of all the
</p>
<p>persons connected with them. I have sent you two
</p>
<p>numbers of a Swiss journal in which there is an
</p>
<p>abstract of this catalogue, drawn up with the greatest
</p>
<p>care. You will perceive from it that the Jesuits' houses
</p>
<p>have greatly augmented in number in France, since
</p>
<p>the pope made a show of promising M. Rossi and
</p>
<p>M. Guizot that they should have no more establish-

<p>ments in your country. The chambers will see how
</p>
<p>their demands have been derided. France will learn
</p>
<p>how she is duped, and what is the occult power that
</p>
<p>rules the government. For proof of all this, I refer to
</p>
<p>the analysis of the famous catalogue, which you will
</p>
<p>not fail to publish.
</p>
<p>" There are two other documents, which you can
</p>
<p>see in the Helvetic of Dec. 18. The first is an address
</p>
<p>of two Fribourg magistrates, the president of the old
</p>
<p>great council, and a councillor of state, who humbly
</p>
<p>prostrating themselves at the feet of the Holy Father,
</p>
<p>recommend M. Marilley for bishop of the diocese, care
</p>
<p>fully insisting on the fact that he is most favourable to
</p>
<p>the order of the Jesuits. Now that prelate, a consum
</p>
<p>mate hypocrite, had been at war with the society, and
</p>
<p>gave himself out for a liberal.
</p>
<p>"The other document is still more curious and
</p>
<p>instructive. It is an address from the deaconry of
</p>
<p>Romont (Canton of Fribourg) to the apostolic nuncio
</p>
<p>at Lucerne, dated Dec. 20, 1845, and recommending
</p>
<p>the same Marilley, a parish priest expelled from
</p>
<p>Geneva, to the pope's choice as bishop. The clergy of
</p>
<p>the deaconry, labouring hard to refute one by one the
</p>
<p>calumnious accusations directed against their protegC,
</p>
<p>prove that M. Marilley by no means deserves the
</p>
<p>epithet of liberal ; that he is not even a little liberal;
</p>
<p>and that far from being hostile to the reverend Jesuit
</p>
<p>fathers, he has given them authentic testimonies of his

</p>
<p>special veneration and esteem. The most remarkable
</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>passages of the address from the deaconry of Romont
</p>
<p>are those relating to pohtics. Speaking of the CathoHc
</p>
<p>association, of which, like almost all the clergy of the
</p>
<p>diocese, M. Marilley was a member, his protectors say,
</p>
<p>' In 1837 this association wrested by its influence the
</p>
<p>majority in the grand council from the radicals, who
</p>
<p>were threatening among other things to dismiss the
</p>
<p>reverend Jesuit fathers from the canton. So the con
</p>
<p>servatives owe to this calumniated association their
</p>
<p>majority and their places, and the reverend Jesuit
</p>
<p>fathers owe to it their actual existence in Fribourg.'
</p>
<p>" Further on, with respect to the old doctrinaire
</p>
<p>conservative government of Geneva, the address says,
</p>
<p>' Geneva does not choose to be either frankly conserva
</p>
<p>tive, because it is Protestant, or openly radical, because
</p>
<p>its votes are swayed by its material interests, and by the
</p>
<p>potent suggestions of Sardinia and France.' Other
</p>
<p>passages manifest the close alliance of the Jesuits and
</p>
<p>of the conservatives, both protestant and catholic.
</p>
<p>" A fourth document is the report of an inquiry
</p>
<p>made in Fribourg by order of the provincial govern
</p>
<p>ment as to the reality of an alleged miracle attributed
</p>
<p>to the Virgin Mary. A priest and other witnesses
</p>
<p>had deposed that a soldier of the landsturm, who wore
</p>
<p>one of those medals of the Immaculate Virgin of
</p>
<p>which I have told you, had been preserved, on the night
</p>
<p>of Dec. 7, from the effect of a ball which had struck

<p>him on the spot coVered by the medal. The

<p>whole is attested by Bishop Etienne Marilley. Now
</p>
<p>Hi INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>the inquiry has rendered the imposture clear and
</p>
<p>palpable ; the knavery of the bishop, the priests, and
</p>
<p>the Jesuits is laid bare. The matter of this inquiry
</p>
<p>will assuredly acquire great publicity.
</p>
<p>" The Valais is not less rich in revelations than
</p>
<p>Fribourg and Lucerne. The federal representatives
</p>
<p>have in their hands all the official documents and the
</p>
<p>correspondences respecting the Sonderbund and the
</p>
<p>late military events, among others an authentic deed
</p>
<p>proving that Austria made the League the present of
</p>
<p>three thousand muskets which you know of. These
</p>
<p>documents contain proof that the League was a
</p>
<p>European affair, and that the purpose was to establish
</p>
<p>in Switzerland the forces of ultramontanism and the
</p>
<p>centre of re-action ; that what was designed was not
</p>
<p>an accidental association, and a defence merely against
</p>
<p>the attacks of the free corps, but a permanent League,
</p>
<p>and a dissolution of the Confederation in order to the
</p>
<p>reconstruction of another which should be recognised,
</p>
<p>supported, and ruled by foreign diplomacy.
</p>

</p>
<p>Fresh ones are discovered every day."

</p>
<p>Enough so far to raise a corner of the veil. The
</p>
<p>plot is seen in action just as it is laid down in the
</p>
<p>Secret Plan, with which the reader is about to be
</p>
<p>acquainted. Its scope, we perceive, is formidable.

<p>Every means is welcome to its concocters that can

</p>
<p>forward their success. Their journals, especially the
</p>
<p>Univers, strangely mistaking the age, have promul
</p>
<p>gated plenty of miracles to sanctify the cause of the
</p>
<p>Jesuits in July. Their abominable fraud has not been
</p>
<p>able to remain concealed; the press holds up its perpe
</p>
<p>trators to contempt. Here then we have it proved
</p>
<p>for the thousandth time, that this order, continually
</p>
<p>urged by infernal ambition, meditates the ruin of all
</p>
<p>liberty, and by its counsels is hurrying princes, nobles,
</p>
<p>and states to their ruin. It is its suggestions that
</p>
<p>petrify the heart of the King of Naples, in whose
</p>
<p>dominions one of the members of the Company has
</p>
<p>been heard preaching the most hideous absolutism and
</p>
<p>bhnd obedience, as the most sacred and inviolable duty
</p>
<p>of the multitude. This is their very doctrine ; and
</p>
<p>when they preach a different one, it is but a trick, and
</p>
<p>is practised there only where they lack the support of
</p>
<p>despotism. Lastly, let us hear the captive of St. Helena
</p>
<p>expressing his whole opinion of this order. But be it
</p>
<p>remembered in the first place, that it is not for the sake
</p>
<p>of right and reason Napoleon declares himself an enemy
</p>
<p>to Jesuitism. He feared reason ; right he deemed a
</p>
<p>thing not to be realised ; and as for liberty, he could
</p>
<p>never comprehend it. " Louis XIV.," he exclaimed,
</p>
<p>" the greatest sovereign France has had ! He and I

<p>that is all."* He even thought that the people should

<p>not be allowed the Bible* " In China," said he, "the
</p>
<p>people worship their sovereign as a god, and so it
</p>
<p>should be."\ Now, he felt strong enough, as he says,
</p>
<p>to make the pope his tool, and Catholicism a means of
</p>
<p>his power. He liked the latter, because it enjoins men
</p>
<p>to distrust their reason and believe blindly. " The
</p>
<p>CathoHc religion is the best of all, because it speaks to
</p>
<p>the eyes of the multitude, and aids the constituted
</p>
<p>authority." % In another place he says he prefers it
</p>
<p>because "it is an all-potent auxiliary of royalty." 
</p>
<p>He admitted all sorts of monks, and thought he could
</p>
<p>make something of them, except the Jesuits. On his
</p>
<p>rock he speaks of them with nothing but abhorrence,
</p>
<p>and is convinced that he could not resist them with
</p>
<p>more profound or more decisive means than their own ;
</p>
<p>and that wherever they exist, such is the force of their
</p>
<p>stratagems and manoeuvres, that they rule and master
</p>
<p>everything in a manner unknown to everybody.
</p>
<p>" But," says he, " a very dangerous society, and one
</p>
<p>which would never have been admitted on the soil of
</p>
<p>the Empire, is that of the Jesuits. Its doctrines are
</p>
<p>subversive of all monarchical principles. The general
</p>
<p>of the Jesuits insists on being sovereign master,
</p>
<p>sovereign over the sovereign. Wherever the Jesuits
</p>
<p>are admitted, they will be masters, cost what it may.
</p>
<p>Their society is by nature dictatorial, and therefore it
</p>
<p>is the irreconcilable enemy of all constituted authority.

<p>SECRET PLAN OE THE JESUITS.
</p>
<p>PAET I.
</p>
<p>NOVITIATE AND ECCLESIASTIC CAREER.
</p>
<p>I.
</p>
<p>At the age of nineteen I had formed the resolution of enter
</p>
<p>ing the church, and was finishing my studies at the Seminary
</p>
<p>of Vercelli. I usually passed my vacations in the company
</p>
<p>of Luigi Quarelli, arch-priest and cure of Langosco, my
</p>
<p>native place. Incited by an eager thirst for knowledge, I
</p>
<p>had, in the course of a few years, completely exhausted his
</p>
<p>library ; and often did this worthy man repeat to me, that
</p>
<p>so far from learning being of any use to me, it would more
</p>
<p>probably be an obstacle to my advancement in the church.
</p>
<p>He now began to speak to me of the Jesuits. The power
</p>
<p>of this order, its reverses, its recent restoration, the im
</p>
<p>penetrable mystery in which it has been enveloped since its
</p>
<p>origin, all contributed to exalt it in his eyes. According
</p>
<p>to his account, none were admitted into it but such as
</p>
<p>were distinguished for intellect, wealth, or station. He
</p>
<p>spoke of it as the only order which, so far from repressing
</p>
<p>the native energies of the mind, or the tendencies of genius,
</p>
<p>did actually favour them in every way. This assertion he
</p>
<p>substantiated by many striking examples.

<p>B
</p>
<p>a SECBET PLAN
</p>
<p>The impression made on me by these conversations was
</p>
<p>exceedingly strong. Young, inexperienced, and dazzled by
</p>
<p>statements which taught me to regard Jesuitism as the only
</p>
<p>resource of a noble ambition, I longed for nothing so much
</p>
<p>as to be received into the order. Neither the thought of
</p>
<p>abandoning my parents, nor that of the severe trials to
</p>
<p>which I must subject myself, could, in any way, divert me
</p>
<p>from my purpose.
</p>
<p>The cure scrupulously examined my resolution, and
</p>
<p>the result being satisfactory, he wrote to Turin, to Father
</p>
<p>Roothaan, then rector of a college of the society in that
</p>
<p>town, and now general of the Jesuits. The rector, after
</p>
<p>having made the customary inquiries respecting me, inti
</p>
<p>mated that I might repair to the capital, and undergo the
</p>
<p>preliminary examinations.
</p>
<p>I therefore took my departure. When I presented
</p>
<p>myself to him, he conversed with me for some time, and with
</p>
<p>great openness and affability. At first, his object appeared
</p>
<p>to be merely to acquaint himself with the extent of my
</p>
<p>acquirements, but by degrees he led me on insensibly to
</p>
<p>make a general confession, as it were, of my whole life.
</p>
<p>I will not here attempt to retrace the details of this con
</p>
<p>versation. It would be difficult for me to convey an idea
</p>
<p>of the consummate art employed to sound a conscience,
</p>
<p>to descend into the very depths of the inmost heart, and
</p>
<p>to make all its chords resound, the individual remaining, all
</p>
<p>the while, unconscious of the analysis which is going on,
</p>
<p>so occupied is he by the pleasant flow of the conversation,
</p>
<p>so beguiled by the air of frank good-nature with which the
</p>
<p>artful process is conducted.

</p>
<p>I have retained but vague and disjointed recollections of
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS.
</p>
<p>all these subtle artifices. One portion of the conversation
</p>
<p>however, imprinted itself so deeply in my memory that I will
</p>
<p>repeat it, in order to show under what point of view the
</p>
<p>present chief of the Jesuits had already begun to regard the
</p>
<p>mission and aim of his order.
</p>
<p>" And now," said he, after having examined me, " what
</p>
<p>I have to communicate to you is calculated to fill you with
</p>
<p>hope and joy. You enter our society at a time when its
</p>
<p>adherents are far from numerous, and when there is, conse
</p>
<p>quently, every encouragement to aspire to a rapid elevation.
</p>
<p>But think not that on entering it you are to fold your arms
</p>
<p>and dream. You are aware that our society, at one time,
</p>
<p>flourished vigorously, that it marched with giant steps in
</p>
<p>the conquest of souls, and that the cause of Christ and of
</p>
<p>the Holy See achieved signal victories by our means. But
</p>
<p>the very greatness of the work we were fulfilling, excited
</p>
<p>envy without bounds. The spirit of our order was attacked,
</p>
<p>all our views were misrepresented and calumniated, and as

<p>just judgment of Heaven, gave rise to a last calumny against
</p>
<p>us, which crowned all the others. Our last struggle was
</p>
<p>ended ; we died  but though dead, the powerful still trembled
</p>
<p>at our name. They made haste to seal up our tomb, and
</p>
<p>they set over it a vigilant guard, so that there might not be
</p>
<p>the faintest sign of life beneath the stone which covered us.
</p>
<p>" But behold what became of the potentates themselves,
</p>
<p>during our sleep of death ! Day by day they were visited
</p>
<p>by chastisements more and more severe. The world became
</p>
<p>the theatre of direful troubles and terrible catastrophes.
</p>
<p>A giant threaded (infilzava) crowns upon his resistless
</p>
<p>sword, and monarchs were cast down in the dust at his feet.
</p>
<p>But the moment of terror soon arrived, in which Almighty
</p>
<p>God broke the sword of the man of fate, and called us from
</p>
<p>the sepulchre. Our resurrection struck the nations with
</p>
<p>astonishment ; and now we shall be no more the sport and
</p>
<p>the prey of the wicked, for our society is destined to become
</p>
<p>the right arm of the Eternal !
</p>
<p>" Thus, a new era is opening for us. All that the church
</p>
<p>has lost she will regain through us. Our order, by its acti
</p>
<p>vity, its efforts, and its devotedness, will vivify ail ihe other
</p>
<p>orders, now well nigh extinct. It will bear to all parts the
</p>
<p>torch of truth, for the dispersion of falsehood ; it will bring
</p>
<p>back to the faith those whom incredulity has led astray ; it
</p>
<p>will, in a word, realise the promise contained in the gospel,
</p>
<p>that all men shall be one fold under one Shepherd.
</p>
<p>" Henceforward, then, no more disasters ; the future is
</p>
<p>wholly ours. Our march will be victorious, our conquests
</p>
<p>incessant, our triumph decisive.

</p>
<p>it is right that I should warn you of this. The mission
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 5
</p>
<p>which our society imposes on itself is a stern one. We do
</p>
<p>not (it is important that you should know this), we do not
</p>
<p>aim only at restoring their ancient empire to some fragments
</p>
<p>of truth, but at restoring it to the whole Catholic truth.
</p>
<p>Thus, there is no pride or pretension that our order does
</p>
<p>not ruffle and wound : whence result all sorts of accusations,
</p>
<p>which we must support with courage. Bear in mind, when
</p>
<p>once the hand is laid to the plough, the only thought must be
</p>
<p>how to run the furrow straight. Made animo, then, look
</p>
<p>not backwards. You can do much. Besides, I think that
</p>
<p>the more you become penetrated with the spirit of the order
</p>
<p> if God, as I trust, grants you the grace to become one
</p>
<p>of its members  the more energy you will feel in yourself
</p>
<p>for the task which the superiors, and not human caprice,
</p>
<p>will assign you. Your superiors alone must be judges of
</p>
<p>this, for God always especially directs them, in order that
</p>
<p>each one, remaining at the post which is suitable to him,
</p>
<p>may most usefully co-operate in the great work, namely,
</p>
<p>the raising up of the church, the salvation of the world,
</p>
<p>and the union of all sects and parties under the authority
</p>
<p>of him who, as the representative of God himself on earth,
</p>
<p>cannot but act in the interest of all, on condition, howeveb,
</p>
<p>THAT ALL CONSENT TO OBEY HIM."

<p>II.
</p>
<p>This discourse, which I have considerably abridged,
</p>
<p>excited my imagination, filled me with new thoughts,
</p>
<p>and awakened in my heart an ardent faith. My visit to

</p>
<p>phrases that flowed abundantly from his lips, the singular
</p>
<p>address he displayed in rendering his conversation always
</p>
<p>full of interest all this had soon subjugated me most com
</p>
<p>pletely to the Jesuits.
</p>
<p>The reader may imagine what I felt on the occasion
</p>
<p>of this memorable interview. I was at the age of enthu
</p>
<p>siasm, the age in which all our faculties spring with
</p>
<p>undivided purpose towards their aim, whatever it may
</p>
<p>be. My mind had remained till then absorbed in a
</p>
<p>sort of half slumber. Transported  inflamed for a cause
</p>
<p>which I believed to be that of God himself, my sole aspi
</p>
<p>ration was to pronounce the vows which were to bind me to
</p>
<p>i t for ever.
</p>
<p>On learning my decision my father was struck with the
</p>
<p>deepest sorrow : nor can I describe the distress of my poor
</p>
<p>mother ; but though the strong affection I felt for her had
</p>
<p>always given her a great influence over me, this time her
</p>
<p>prayers could not change my determination. Luigi di Ber-
</p>
<p>nardi, a man of uncommon worth, a priest, anti-monastic on
</p>
<p>principle, by whom I had been early initiated into all that is
</p>
<p>manly, austere, and sublime in the annals of Greece and
</p>
<p>Rome, exerted all his energy and all his knowledge to
</p>
<p>change the bent of my mind. All his efforts failed to
</p>
<p>shake my resolution, though my gratitude and my respect
</p>
<p>for him were boundless. Many friends also beset me, and
</p>
<p>added additional gloom in the appalling pictures which
</p>
<p>several persons had already traced to me of the order of
</p>
<p>the Jesuits. But in all this I saw nothing but pure male
</p>
<p>volence, or stratagems devised to change my resolution.
</p>
<p>At length my father declared that I should never have

</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 7
</p>
<p>The arch-priest Quarelli, grieved at our approaching
</p>
<p>separation, was obliged, almost in spite of himself, to make
</p>
<p>use of an argument which he knew would be decisive with
</p>
<p>my father and mother, both overcome with anguish at the
</p>
<p>thought of losing their only child.
</p>
<p>He told them that everything proved the irresistible
</p>
<p>force of my vocation, and that my internal struggles were no
</p>
<p>less cruel than theirs ; that it was absolutely necessary to
</p>
<p>obey the voice which called me, under pain of warring
</p>
<p>against God himelf. He reminded them of Abraham, and
</p>
<p>of his willingness to sacrifice his only son. " Besides," con
</p>
<p>tinued he, " perhaps he will not be entirely lost to you :
</p>
<p>perhaps God will permit that you shall embrace him some
</p>
<p>times before your death. You cannot live in peace with
</p>
<p>your conscience unless you consent, and, be well assured,
</p>
<p>the reward that awaits you at your last home will be equal
</p>
<p>to the greatness of your sacrifice ; while, on the other hand,
</p>
<p>how deep would be your remorse if you persisted in re
</p>
<p>fusing to God that which he asks of you !"
</p>
<p>To talk thus to my parents was to attack them on their
</p>
<p>vulnerable side. Though they were most deeply afflicted,
</p>
<p>they consented at last to bid me farewell. My father was
</p>
<p>unable to pronounce a single word ; my mother was almost
</p>
<p>overwhelmed by grief.
</p>
<p>Just at this time Father Roothaan wrote thus to me : 
</p>
<p>" Dearly beloved son, I trust that you will follow up
</p>
<p>your holy vocation in such a manner that we may never
</p>
<p>have to repent  you, of the resolution you have taken ; I,
</p>
<p>of having proposed you ; the superiors, of having accepted
</p>
<p>you. Your eternal salvation, your solid religious perfection

<p>and principal motive for which you desire to enter into
</p>
<p>the company. You will need all your courage, as I
</p>
<p>told you, when you come to me for examination. In
</p>
<p>order to be a good and a true Jesuit it is indispensa
</p>
<p>ble to possess a strong heart, and to be ready not only
</p>
<p>to labour much, but to suffer much  aye, even unto
</p>
<p>death!  to be persevering in humility, in obedience,
</p>
<p>in patience, seeking only God, who will himself be merces

<p>vestra magna nimis. Therefore, confortare et esto robustus.
</p>
<p>In giving yourself up to the order you place yourself in the

<p>Him, and He will conduct you safely to port ! Under His

<p>diately to Chieri, that you may there lay, in the novitiate,
</p>
<p>the solid foundations of a truly religious and Jesuitical hfe."
</p>
<p>A few days afterwards I received from him another
</p>
<p>letter, in the following terms : 
</p>
<p>" Now, then, you may at once enter the novitiate. Such
</p>
<p>is the purport of a letter of yesterday's date, sent me by

<p>the father rector of Chieri. Call at St. Franijois-de-Paule, in

</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS.
</p>
<p>III.
</p>
<p>I set out accordingly. On my arrival, they placed
</p>
<p>in my hands the rules which related to this first phasis
</p>
<p>of my new existence. I was immediately initiated into
</p>
<p>the exercises of Saint Ignatius, and of other saints 
</p>
<p>all Jesuits. It is by this sudden and complete immer
</p>
<p>sion of the soul that they acquire their unlimited power
</p>
<p>over so many young men, unarmed by experience, and
</p>
<p>totally without defence, from the unreflecting enthusiasm
</p>
<p>which belongs to their age.
</p>
<p>The most profound silence, rarely interrupted even by
</p>
<p>whispers, reigned in this abode, which was however not
</p>
<p>destitute of material comforts. The guardian angel (for this
</p>
<p>is the name given to the father attached to each novice)
</p>
<p>was accustomed to close the shutters of my windows, in
</p>
<p>order that I might remain as much as possible in obscurity.
</p>
<p>Thus seated, in partial darkness, he reasoned aloud on the
</p>
<p>world, on sin, and on eternal punishment. Conformably
</p>
<p>to one of the rules of the founder of the society, he desig
</p>
<p>nated those who do not submit in all things to the decisions
</p>
<p>of the church, as an army of rebels, angels of darkness,
</p>
<p>whom Satan inspires and governs, and against whom battle
</p>
<p>must be waged, until the day of final victory by the army
</p>
<p>of the faithful, led on by those angels of light and chiefs
</p>
<p>of the sacred militia, the Jesuits. As for the enemy's
</p>
<p>camp, he spoke of nothing in it but its reeking pestilence
</p>
<p>and corruption.

</p>
<p>The indispensable complement of these private and daily
</p>
<p>10 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>discourses is weekly confession, comprising an avowal of
</p>
<p>every affection of the heart, every sentiment of the mind,
</p>
<p>and even of one's dreams. This is the plummet-line always
</p>
<p>kept in hand by the superiors, and by means of which they
</p>
<p>ascertain what is passing in the very depth of their pupils'
</p>
<p>consciences. The miracles of all sorts with which the heads
</p>
<p>of the latter are filled are all invented in order to rear upon
</p>
<p>supernatural bases a structure of absolute and blind obedi
</p>
<p>ence. Under such a system, wherein there is neither con
</p>
<p>versation, nor reading, nor devotional exercise which has
</p>
<p>not been elaborately adjusted by a mysterious power, in
</p>
<p>such a manner as to take possession of both the under
</p>
<p>standing and the heart, each individual who has been
</p>
<p>wrought upon during a sufficient time, comes at last to
</p>
<p>consider himself religiously bound to the total surrender of
</p>
<p>his own will.
</p>
<p>For myself, I felt my own personality daily diminish
</p>
<p>ing, and I blessed this progressive self-annihilation, and
</p>
<p>recognised in it the sign of my salvation.
</p>
<p>The subject most peculiarly dwelt upon, during my
</p>
<p>confessions, was the affection which still bound me to the
</p>
<p>remembrance of my friends and relations. I was con
</p>
<p>stantly told that it was my imperative duty to tear asunder
</p>
<p>these bonds of affection, and stifle these remembrances :
</p>
<p>their complete immolation was represented to me as the
</p>
<p>most sacred of triumphs. To devote myself entirely to the
</p>
<p>order, was the sole object prescribed to me. As long as
</p>
<p>there existed within me the smallest trace of self-will, or
</p>
<p>of earthly affection, there would be something remaining
</p>
<p>of the " old man" which was finally to be absorbed in the

<p>Jesuit. I was by no means astonished that they should
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 11
</p>
<p>thus seek to convert me into a new being, for I truly be
</p>
<p>lieved that the more I should identify myself with the society
</p>
<p>the more I should belong to God ; and in this deadening of
</p>
<p>every feeling which might stand in the way of my entire
</p>
<p>dedication to the order, I perceived nothing but a just and
</p>
<p>reasonable consequence of its directing principle : " that
</p>
<p>the fewer ties we have with all that might distract us from
</p>
<p>our purpose, the more will be our power to persuade
</p>
<p>others to acknowledge that authority which it is the mission
</p>
<p>of the Jesuits to proclaim, as the only one upon earth which
</p>
<p>is not subject to error."
</p>
<p>IV.
</p>
<p>Thus far, all went on well. However laborious it might
</p>
<p>be, I subjected myself resolutely to the probatoria (the pro
</p>
<p>bation which precedes the novitiate). Not that I was
</p>
<p>exempt from anxiety and sorrow. Far from it. In hours
</p>
<p>of deep depression and anguish, my thoughts recurring to
</p>
<p>many a beloved object I had just forsaken, and feeling that
</p>
<p>my heart was empty, my mind perturbed, my soul sinking
</p>
<p>within me, and even my imagination, hitherto so free,
</p>
<p>enchained, I confess that I shrank back with terror and
</p>
<p>repented. Never, however, even in those gloomy moments,
</p>
<p>did the idea of renouncing the society seriously take pos
</p>
<p>session of me. The fact is, there was not a particle of all I
</p>
<p>had heard from Father Roothaan, but what I believed to
</p>
<p>be true, noble, holy, and more worthy to be followed than
</p>
<p>anything else on earth. Moreover, when these mental

</p>
<p>struggles beset me, I was told that those very persons who
</p>
<p>12 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>had sustained the like, had afterwards made themselves the
</p>
<p>most distinguished in the order for their zeal ; and that
</p>
<p>far from regarding such things as proofs of a want of voca
</p>
<p>tion, I ought rather to behold in them a mark of Divine
</p>
<p>election. " By and by,'' they told me, " when your studies
</p>
<p>shall have been completed, the immolation of the ' old
</p>
<p>man ' accomplished, and your special vocation determined,
</p>
<p>you will only have to unfold your wings without fear of
</p>
<p>any impediment to your soaring flight."
</p>
<p>This sort of language cheered me, and it is probable that
</p>
<p>I should have grown more and more attached to the society,
</p>
<p>that I should even have become one of its most devoted
</p>
<p>members, but for the incidents which I am about to relate.
</p>
<p>My too intense application to the subjects of a gloomy
</p>
<p>devotion, and the utter solitude of the probatoria, had
</p>
<p>broken down my spirits and my health. The first com
</p>
<p>plaint I made, immediately procured me the indulgence of
</p>
<p>meat on a fast-day ; and, when I would have refused this
</p>
<p>favour, it was in vain that I alleged the trifling nature of
</p>
<p>my indisposition. My guardian angel, Father Saetti, of
</p>
<p>Modena, solemnly replied to me that I ought to take
</p>
<p>especial care of my health, that I was called to be a labourer
</p>
<p>in the Lord's field, and that it was by no means the inten
</p>
<p>tion of the church to exact too much of those who, having
</p>
<p>torn asunder all the bonds of the flesh and of the world,
</p>
<p>delivered themselves up to her with devotedness.

</p>
<p>my extreme repugnance, to drink a sort of mulled wine,
</p>
<p>rather thick, and of a singular flavour, which had the effect of
</p>
<p>producing, during the whole of the day, a species of torpor
</p>
<p>which I had never before experienced. In vain I refused
</p>
<p>this potion; all I could obtain was the permission to begin
</p>
<p>with small doses, until I should become accustomed to it.
</p>
<p>At length, fatigued by long poring over ascetic books,
</p>
<p>and by the meditations which I was required to make
</p>
<p>again and again for hours on my knees, without any sup
</p>
<p>port, and being tempted by the fine autumn weather to
</p>
<p>breathe the fresh air and enjoy the sunshine, I begged my
</p>
<p>guardian angel to ask permission for me of the rector to
</p>
<p>walk for a few moments alone in the garden. " You have
</p>
<p>only," he replied, " to go to him and ask this permission
</p>
<p>for yourself; you may be certain he will grant you what
</p>
<p>ever favour is in his power."
</p>
<p>It was not, however, until two days afterwards that, ex
</p>
<p>cited by the splendour of a day more than usually beautiful,
</p>
<p>I resolved to make my request.
</p>
<p>It was in the afternoon. I quitted my chamber, and
</p>
<p>went to the rector's apartment, the door of which I found
</p>
<p>open, although the rector was absent. This circumstance
</p>
<p>surprised me not a little, as among the Jesuits everything
</p>
<p>is conducted with the most exact regularity.
</p>
<p>As the novices never address the superior, who has
</p>
<p>the direction of the novitiate, otherwise than by his title
</p>
<p>of rector, I am unable here to designate him by his name ;
</p>
<p>but nothing would be easier than to know it by ascer
</p>
<p>taining who was the Jesuit father occupying the direction of
</p>
<p>the novitiate house at Chieri in the month of September, 1 824.

<p>had every reason to be gratified by his kindness to me,
</p>
<p>and separated as I was from all those whom I had loved,
</p>
<p>I began to feel some attachment for him. From my first
</p>
<p>entrance into the house, he had even admitted me to a
</p>
<p>considerable degree of familiarity, with a view, no doubt,
</p>
<p>to insinuate himself into my confidence, all of which,

<p>to go from one room to another, and to allow myself to do

<p>what I am about to relate.

</p>
<p>I entered, then, the opened door, and perceiving no
</p>
<p>thing unusual in the room, except a small table, covered
</p>
<p>with bottles and glasses, in the right-hand corner, I sup
</p>
<p>posed that the rector's absence was momentary, and that
</p>
<p>he would presently return. For want of something to do,
</p>
<p>I sauntered with a sort of lazy curiosity into an adjacent
</p>
<p>chamber, where a small library immediately attracted my
</p>
<p>attention. Impressed as I was by the holy maxims which
</p>
<p>were daily repeated to me, and above all by those solemn
</p>
<p>words which began and closed every conversation  AA

<p>imagine anything more touching than the generosity with
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. ]5
</p>
<p>which the fathers attribute to each other the rarest virtues
</p>
<p>and the most astonishingly miraculous of powers. I was
</p>
<p>not far, indeed, from believing implicitly that I was an
</p>
<p>inmate of a place peculiarly favoured by a constant com
</p>
<p>munion with Heaven.
</p>
<p>It was impossible, then, that I should for a moment
</p>
<p>conceive the thought that the rooms of the rector of a
</p>
<p>novitiate, who, as my confessor, was ever exciting me to a
</p>
<p>life of purity and elevation, should contain any books but
</p>
<p>those of piety and holiness. Weary as I had grown for
</p>
<p>some time of incessantly reading the exercises of Saint
</p>
<p>Ignatius, and incited by an irresistible desire to turn over
</p>
<p>some other leaves than those, I raised my hand to a shelf
</p>
<p>of the library, and joyfully seized a volume. To my sur
</p>
<p>prise, I perceived a second row of books behind the first.
</p>
<p>Curiosity impelled me to take down the volume which
</p>
<p>had been concealed by the first I laid hold on. The name
</p>
<p>of the author has escaped my recollection, but it was, I
</p>
<p>think, a philosopher of the last century. I should have
</p>
<p>looked at it more deliberately, had not a third row of books,
</p>
<p>behind the second, struck me by the peculiar style of
</p>
<p>the binding. What was my astonishment when this title
</p>
<p>met my gaze, " Confessions of the Novices ! " The
</p>
<p>side edges of the book were marked with the letters of the
</p>
<p>alphabet. Could I do less than seek for the initial of my
</p>
<p>own name 1
</p>
<p>The first pages, written, probably, a few days after my
</p>
<p>arrival, contained a rough sketch of my character. I was
</p>
<p>utterly confounded. I recognised my successive confes
</p>
<p>sions, each condensed into a few lines. So clear and accu

</p>
<p>rate was the appreciation given of my temperament, my
</p>
<p>lb SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>faculties, my affections, my weakness and my strength, that
</p>
<p>I saw before my eyes a complete revelation of my own
</p>
<p>nature. What surprised me above all was the concise
</p>
<p>ness and energy of the expressions employed to sum up the
</p>
<p>characteristics of my whole being. The favourite images
</p>
<p>I found in this depository of outpourings of all sorts from
</p>
<p>the heart of ingenuous youth, were borrowed from the
</p>
<p>materials used in building  hard, fragile, malleable, coarse,
</p>
<p>precious, necessary, accessory ; a sort of figurative language
</p>
<p>which has kept fast hold on my memory. I only regret that
</p>
<p>I could but glance with the rapidity of lightning over the
</p>
<p>pages that concerned myself; yet this glance sufficed to
</p>
<p>reveal to me .the object of such a work. An idea may be
</p>
<p>formed of it from the passage I am about to cite, and of
</p>
<p>which I have retained an indelible remembrance.
</p>
<p>" The amount of enthusiasm and imagination with which
</p>
<p>he is endowed," said the text, " might in time be made very
</p>
<p>useful in varnishing our work. His want of taste for the
</p>
<p>grotesque (sic) in religion* will do no harm, but it proves
</p>
<p>that his talent must be employed in recommending and
</p>
<p>exalting, to the more delicate consciences, all that is pure
</p>
<p>and ennobling in religion. He would spoil all if we
</p>
<p>were to let him set to work on the clumsier parts of the

<p>edifice ; whilst he will greatly aid its advancement if he is

<p>* Father Saetti, knocking at my door one morning, according to
</p>
<p>his custom, I did not immediately open it. " Why this delay ?" he
</p>
<p>asked me. I replied that I could not open the door sooner. He then
</p>
<p>reminded jne that, in all things, the most prompt obedience was the
</p>
<p>most perfect ; that in obeying God we must make every sacrifice, even
</p>
<p>that of a moment of time. " One of the brethren," he continued,

</p>
<p>be kept, therefore, in the upper regions of thought, and let
</p>
<p>him not even be aware of the springs which set in movement
</p>
<p>the vulgar part of the religious world.
</p>
<p>" It is important that he should always have near him,
</p>
<p>in his moments of depression, some one to cheer him
</p>
<p>with brilliant anticipations. But should his ardour, on the
</p>
<p>contrary, lead him too far, some discouragement or dis
</p>
<p>appointment must be prepared for him, in order to mortify
</p>
<p>him and keep him in subjection."
</p>
<p>Not an atom of what I had, as a matter of conscience,
</p>
<p>revealed to my guardian angel, or confessor, was omitted
</p>
<p>in this register. When I recollect what sweeping induc
</p>
<p>tions were drawn from the trifles which I had considered
</p>
<p>myself bound to communicate, I cannot wonder that such a
</p>
<p>system, so based on profound study of character, pursued
</p>
<p>with so much assiduity and constancy, and applied on
</p>
<p>so vast a scale to individuals of every age and every con
</p>
<p>dition, should place in the hands of the Jesuits an almost
</p>
<p>infallible means for attaining the end which they have pro
</p>
<p>posed to themselves, with such extraordinary determi
</p>
<p>nation. It may be imagined what were the reflections aroused
</p>
<p>within me on the discovery I had made. In an instant I

<p>the door, and on returning to his seat, he found the o completed, and
</p>
<p>all in gold! Thus you see how God rewards him who is obedient."
</p>
<p>I received this story with a burst of laughter, at which he appeared
</p>
<p>much scandalised. " What !" he exclaimed, with an alarmed face, "do
</p>
<p>you not believe in'miracles ? " " Most certainly I do," replied I j " but
</p>
<p>this one is only fit to tell to old women."
</p>
<p>This was, no doubt, repeated to the superior, and gave rise, I
</p>
<p>imagine, to the secret remarks quoted above.

<p>18 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>recalled all the sinister statements which had been made to
</p>
<p>me respecting this celebrated society. But none of these
</p>
<p>thoughts had time to fix themselves in my mind, so eagerly
</p>
<p>was I incited by the desire to know more. Agitated, car
</p>
<p>ried away, by a dizzy curiosity and an increasing anxiety, I
</p>
<p>seized a volume entitled, Confessions of Strangers. I
</p>
<p>hastily glanced over a few lines, here and there, and the
</p>
<p>small portions that I read induced me afterwards to believe,
</p>
<p>that everything in this order is done conformably to the
</p>
<p>rules of the little code, known by the name of Monita
</p>
<p>Secreta, or Secret Instructions. It was, in fact, a collec
</p>
<p>tion of notes upon persons of every class, of every age,
</p>
<p>rich men, bachelors, &c. Here again were circumstantial
</p>
<p>details  propensities, fortune, family, relations, vices and
</p>
<p>virtues, together with such anecdotes as were calculated to
</p>
<p>characterize the personages. It is only in cases of excep
</p>
<p>tion, as I have since learnt, that a Jesuit remains long in
</p>
<p>the same place. If he be allowed to continue his sojourn
</p>
<p>there, it is only when the superiors are convinced of the
</p>
<p>incontestable utility of the influence which he exercises.
</p>
<p>Whenever a Jesuit, particularly' one of moderate abilities,
</p>
<p>has used up the resources of his mind in any particular
</p>
<p>place, and when he seems to have nothing new to produce,
</p>
<p>the regulations of the order require that he shall be re
</p>
<p>placed by another who may, in his turn, be remarked and
</p>
<p>admired for a longer or a shorter time. In these frequent
</p>
<p>changes there is another advantage : the new-comer, enter
</p>
<p>ing upon the sacred office of his predecessor, as soon as he
</p>
<p>has learnt the names of the persons who choose him for the
</p>
<p>director of their conscience, can, by means of the Register

</p>
<p>experience acquired by his colleagues. This artifice en
</p>
<p>dows him with the infallible power of surprising, confound
</p>
<p>ing, and subjugating the penitents who kneel beside him ;
</p>
<p>he penetrates them most unexpectedly, and, in a manner
</p>
<p>unprecedented, introduces himself into the most hidden
</p>
<p>folds of their hearts. It cannot be told with how much art
</p>
<p>the Jesuits profit by the astonishment they thus excite, and
</p>
<p>how adroitly they turn it to the advancement of their work-
</p>
<p>Thus, I have met with rich bigots, old men, and often with
</p>
<p>young persons of the weaker sex, who boldly maintain that
</p>
<p>the greater number of these reverend fathers are actually
</p>
<p>endowed with the spirit of prophecy.
</p>
<p>VII.
</p>
<p>I was, meanwhile, disposed to make further and bolder
</p>
<p>researches. The book which I next opened was a register
</p>
<p>of Revenues, Acquisitions, and Expenses. In my feverish
</p>
<p>impatience I soon quitted it for another, entitled, Enemies
</p>
<p>of the Society. At this moment I was interrupted by a
</p>
<p>noise which I heard, and scarcely had I time to replace the
</p>
<p>volumes T had disturbed, when I distinguished the sound
</p>
<p>of numerous approaching footsteps, as if several persons
</p>
<p>were about to enter the apartment. Then only I began
</p>
<p>to feel the danger of my presence in the closet.
</p>
<p>Until then I had been wholly absorbed, and hurried
</p>
<p>along, as it were, by a whirlwind. But the discoveries I
</p>
<p>have related proved to be but the prologue to a drama
</p>
<p>infinitely more serious, and which I am about to retrace.

</p>
<p>As soon as I was aware that the rector was returning,
</p>
<p>20 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>along with several other persons, I held a rapid debate
</p>
<p>within myself whether I should leave the inner room, and
</p>
<p>cross the other in their presence, or remain hidden as
</p>
<p>I was. But, in order to render my narrative more clear,
</p>
<p>I ought here, perhaps, to relate a fact which can alone ex
</p>
<p>plain why I had found the door of the apartment open.
</p>
<p>I learnt afterwards that a rich nobleman and courtier* had
</p>
<p>come to pay a visit to the Jesuit fathers at Chieri. I had
</p>
<p>myself a few days previously heard a rumour of the ex
</p>
<p>pected arrival of some fathers from a distance. At this
</p>
<p>period, the Jesuits were beginning to plant some roots in
</p>
<p>Piedmont, of which they meditated the conquest; and I
</p>
<p>doubt not that the superiors of the society resident at
</p>
<p>Chieri wished to offer a flattering reception to this high
</p>
<p>personage. Their conversation had, probably, run upon
</p>
<p>the work which they proposed to undertake in that country.
</p>
<p>I understood, at least, from some of their expressions, that
</p>
<p>they congratulated themselves on having interested their
</p>
<p>noble visitor, and trusted that they had acquired in him
</p>
<p>a powerful supporter. There seems every reason to sup
</p>
<p>pose that the fathers, desirous of pleasing him, had, in their
</p>
<p>excess of politeness, accompanied him to his carriage, where
</p>
<p>the conversation and the parting compliments had been
</p>
<p>prolonged more than a quarter of an hour, whilst it had
</p>
<p>occurred to no one amongst them that the door of the
</p>
<p>rector's apartment was left open.

</p>
<p>exactly report. To judge from the noise of voices, there
</p>
<p>might be at least eight or ten of them.
</p>
<p>As to myself, my perplexity may be better conceived
</p>
<p>than described. I was bewildered. What was I to do ?
</p>
<p>Remain ? But every moment I might expect to be dis
</p>
<p>covered, and then! Should I open the door, and break
</p>
<p>in upon their eager conversation ? But I was too much
</p>
<p>agitated, too much oppressed, by what I had just read ;
</p>
<p>besides, what I had already overheard of their projects,
</p>
<p>their eager animation, and the freedom of their speech, all
</p>
<p>terrified me. I trembled at the bare idea of encountering
</p>
<p>their inquisitorial gaze. A fearful reaction had instan
</p>
<p>taneously taken place within me. The Society of Jesus
</p>
<p>was suddenly revealed to me in darker and more repulsive
</p>
<p>colours than those under which it had formerly been depicted
</p>
<p>to me. Confounded, paralyzed, and utterly unable to come
</p>
<p>to any determination, I remained motionless. . . . Far
</p>
<p>from being fatal to me, this loss of time was the circum
</p>
<p>stance which saved me.
</p>
<p>VIII.
</p>
<p>Whilst they were thus conversing together with con
</p>
<p>siderable vehemence, all on a sudden, as if they had dis
</p>
<p>appeared, the noise of their voices ceased, and a dead
</p>
<p>silence ensued. An electric shock could not have produced
</p>
<p>a greater revulsion of feeling than that I experienced ; and
</p>
<p>the door of the room, in which I was, being a little open,
</p>
<p>as it had been from the first, my very pulses seemed to

</p>
<p>stand still during this pause.
</p>
<p>22 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>Yet were I again to be submitted to such a trial, I
</p>
<p>know not whether I should again be capable of the resolu
</p>
<p>tion which then rose within me. I was composed, as it
</p>
<p>were, of two beings. I felt, at the same time, all the
</p>
<p>timidity and all the rash boldness of a child. A sort of
</p>
<p>fascination inspired me with a daring thought, leaving me
</p>
<p>at the same time perfectly aware of the danger of my
</p>
<p>situation. Others may be able to explain this mystery ;
</p>
<p>for myself, I only state what occurred to me. I tell what
</p>
<p>I dared to attempt, and what I effected, without seeking
</p>
<p>to conceal the terror by which I was shaken during its
</p>
<p>execution, and which left an impression upon me that
</p>
<p>lasted more than a twelvemonth. Certain it is that I soon
</p>
<p>experienced, in the midst of my trembling fears, a sort of
</p>
<p>boyish exultation, a feeling of joy and triumph at the idea
</p>
<p>of being initiated into secrets, the mysterious and awful
</p>
<p>nature of which I was led to infer from the revelations of
</p>
<p>the library, the words which struck my ears, the opinion I
</p>
<p>had conceived of the power of the Jesuits, and the remem
</p>
<p>brance, which these circumstances so vividly recalled, of
</p>
<p>all that I had heard in their disfavour. But let me not
</p>
<p>anticipate. Up to this time, I had been endeavouring to collect all
</p>
<p>my courage, in order to present myself before the assembly,
</p>
<p>and attempt to go forth, excusing myself to the rector, if,
</p>
<p>as was most likely, he should interrogate me ; and, pro
</p>
<p>bably, I should have finished by taking this step, had the
</p>
<p>confused conversation continued much longer. The sudden
</p>
<p>silence, the idea that I was discovered, put an end to the
</p>
<p>resolution I was about to take. At the very moment when

</p>
<p>I expected to see the door opened, the incident which
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 23
</p>
<p>took place changed my situation, and rendered it critical
</p>
<p>in the last extreme. At the first words I heard, and which
</p>
<p>I am about to relate, I felt with terror that I was, in fact,
</p>
<p>witness of a council which held up before me the two
</p>
<p>grand perils between which I had to choose. But the
</p>
<p>danger, if I presented myself, was immediate though un
</p>
<p>known, whilst it seemed to me that in temporizing there
</p>
<p>was some chance of safety. This latter plan, too, was the
</p>
<p>easier from its inaction ; it left me a ray of hope that I
</p>
<p>might yet escape undetected, and I remained therefore
</p>
<p>motionless, awaiting my fate. I will now relate the words
</p>
<p>which almost immediately broke the awful silence.
</p>
<p>I do not profess to give with literal accuracy, in each
</p>
<p>expression, the allocution of the Jesuit who filled the office
</p>
<p>of president on this occasion ; but I pledge myself that the
</p>
<p>sense is faithfully and accurately reported : the words,
</p>
<p>which in a moment so grave, and in the midst of such
</p>
<p>profound attention, fell slowly and emphatically on my ear,
</p>
<p>remain indelibly imprinted on my memory.
</p>
<p>" You will excuse me, dear brethren ''  (an imperative
</p>
<p>gesture of the president himself had doubtless produced the
</p>
<p>silence which had been so startling to me)  "you will excuse
</p>
<p>me if I thus interrupt you. You are aware that we have
</p>
<p>no time to lose. To-day, as already resolved, we will enter

<p>into a general view of the interests and the plan of action
</p>
<p>by which our society is at present to be guided. Hitherto
</p>
<p>our discussions have related only to local affairs. We must

<p>present as well as future obstacles. And shall not we," he
</p>
<p>added, with a tone of concentrated haughtiness, " with our
</p>
<p>united efforts, be able to do as much as  nay, more than
</p>
<p>was done by one single man, in a few years, to the astonish
</p>
<p>ment of the whole world 1 Hold yourselves ready then,
</p>
<p>you who have sufficient understanding to throw light upon
</p>
<p>the important questions which we have to resolve.
</p>
<p>" You have, before your eyes, the list of those points
</p>
<p>which form our chief object.
</p>
<p>" What is most important for us is, that our materials
</p>
<p>should augment, and that a book be ultimately made from
</p>
<p>them  I will not say a large book, but such a book, as
</p>
<p>may become, though small in volume, a vast fund, wherein
</p>
<p>shall be concentrated the experience of thousands, for the
</p>
<p>benefit of all those whom we shall initiate into our work. For
</p>
<p>you all know that since quiet is restored, and the genius of
</p>
<p>war is fettered, the mind of every nation is at the disposal
</p>
<p>of him who shall most adroitly take possession of it.
</p>
<p>" But let us not deceive ourselves. However good our
</p>
<p>old swords may be, yet seeing the struggle which awaits us,
</p>
<p>it is not enough to sharpen them ; we must above all things
</p>
<p>modernize them.

</p>
<p>with the multitude who have been bewildered and fascinated
</p>
<p>by such fine-sounding words as 'right,' 'liberty,' 'human
</p>
<p>dignity,' and so forth. It is not by straightforward oppo
</p>
<p>sition, and by depreciating their idols, that we shall prevail.

</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 25
</p>
<p>" Let our first care, therefore, be to change, altogether,
</p>
<p>the nature of our tactics, and to give a new varnish to
</p>
<p>religion, by appearing to make large concessions. This is
</p>
<p>the only means to assure our influence over these moderns,
</p>
<p>half men, half children.
</p>
<p>" We will first, then, take a review of the arsenal of our
</p>
<p>forces. The present meeting shall be the pregnant mother
</p>
<p>of our future proceedings (seance mere), wherein we will
</p>
<p>concentrate all the ideas we have formed upon the epoch,
</p>
<p>so as to turn them to the aggrandisement of the church.
</p>
<p>Here are the minutes of the three preceding meetings,
</p>
<p>which you may all consult at your leisure. Broad margins
</p>
<p>have been left in order that you may note down your reflec
</p>
<p>tions, your rectifications, and even your objections, should
</p>
<p>such present themselves to your minds ; and above all, your
</p>
<p>new views on the difficulties we shall encounter, and on the
</p>
<p>best means of vanquishing them. In this manner we shall
</p>
<p>become more and more enlightened on the grand design of
</p>
<p>our order, and on the course which will most promptly and
</p>
<p>most surely accomplish it.
</p>
<p>" Bear ever in mind that our great object, in the first
</p>
<p>place, is to study deeply and bring to perfection the art of
</p>
<p>rendering ourselves both necessary and formidable to the
</p>
<p>powers that be."

</p>
<p>It almost took away my breath to find the worst that
</p>
<p>had been told me of the Jesuits thus suddenly and un

<p>expectedly confirmed by what I had just read and heard.
</p>
<p>26 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>To open the door now, and to present myself before them,
</p>
<p>would have been the act of a madman. All that remained
</p>
<p>for me was to decide what I should do if I were discovered;
</p>
<p>and I thought my only possible resource, if I heard them
</p>
<p>approach the door, would be to stretch myself on the
</p>
<p>ground as if I were in a fit. I felt, in fact, as if I were on
</p>
<p>the point of being precipitated headlong down a precipice.
</p>
<p>A salutary diversion drew me out of this state of ex
</p>
<p>treme anxiety ; there was a movement and a sound of
</p>
<p>chairs ; they were evidently taking their seats at the table.
</p>
<p>Here was a respite ! I breathed again. The person who
</p>
<p>had already spoken now uttered, in a simple and familiar
</p>
<p>tone, the following words, which suddenly inspired me with
</p>
<p>the feelings and the resolution of which I have spoken
</p>
<p>above. " I should wish," said he, " that nothing should be lost
</p>
<p>of what we are about to say. I desire exceedingly that
</p>
<p>all our ideas may be committed to writing, so that others
</p>
<p>may have opportunity to criticise, develop, or improve
</p>
<p>them. Let us, therefore, deliver them clearly and delibe
</p>
<p>rately, in order that our friend the secretary (Vamico nostro,
</p>
<p>il secretario) may lose nothing of what is said."
</p>
<p>To hear this, to observe near me a small table furnished
</p>
<p>with writing materials, and to resolve to play myself the
</p>
<p>part of secretary, was the work of an instant.
</p>
<p>From the commencement of my studies, first from
</p>
<p>caprice, and afterwards with a special motive, I had in- 
</p>
<p>vented for my own use a system of abbreviations in writing.
</p>
<p>I had only thought, at first, of procuring myself a little
</p>
<p>leisure during the dictation of the lessons, and thus being

</p>
<p>able to amuse myself, with all the vain-glory of a schoolboy,*
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 27
</p>
<p>in watching my fellow-students painfully writing down
</p>
<p>what I had long since finished. The indulgence of this
</p>
<p>diversion sometimes, indeed, induced the professor to
</p>
<p>require me to prove, by reading the dictation, that I had
</p>
<p>really written it. But I afterwards turned this species of
</p>
<p>stenography to more account, because it enabled me to
</p>
<p>enjoy furtive reading during the lessons. And the effect of
</p>
<p>it remains to this day ; for, although I no longer make use
</p>
<p>of this system, I find it difficult to write without many
</p>
<p>abbreviations, so that my handwriting is, unfortunately for
</p>
<p>my correspondents, singularly illegible. Besides, those
</p>
<p>amongst the Jesuits whose native tongue was not Italian
</p>
<p>naturally spoke with slowness. Hence I had no difficulty
</p>
<p>in writing down all that was said. I was thus occupied
</p>
<p>until the close of the day ; a quarter of an hour more, and
</p>
<p>daylight would have totally failed me.
</p>
<p>I will not attempt to describe my sens-ations whilst thus
</p>
<p>occupied. I felt as if I had taken a prodigious leap. Still
</p>
<p>very young (I was only nineteen), simple and confiding, I
</p>
<p>was confronted, wholly unprepared, with the most daring
</p>
<p>and profound machinations which men, such as the chiefs
</p>
<p>of the Jesuits, were capable of devising. The veil with
</p>
<p>drawn, I beheld myself face to face with one of the
</p>
<p>most mysterious powers which has ever been known to
</p>
<p>reduce to system, on a vast scale, the art of subjugating
</p>
<p>all sorts of passions  the passions of the mass, and the
</p>
<p>passions of sovereigns  to the obtaining of a fixed and
</p>
<p>immutable purpose.
</p>
<p>Thus, scarcely daring to make the slightest movement,
</p>
<p>I was able, through the partly-opened door, to hear dis

</p>
<p>tinctly every word. I listened to the discourses of eight or
</p>
<p>28 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>ten of the most energetic chiefs of the society, who, having
</p>
<p>laid aside, on this occasion, their unctuous language, and
</p>
<p>honied phrases of holiness, boldly reasoned upon sects,
</p>
<p>parties, opinions, and interests, weighed both obstacles and
</p>
<p>resources, and built up a colossal edifice of delusion, before
</p>
<p>which Machiavel would have bowed his head.
</p>
<p>This was a rude trial for an understanding so youthful
</p>
<p>and unprepared as mine. Besides this, the singularity of
</p>
<p>my situation  listening to and writing down the words of
</p>
<p>invisible personages, whilst I knew that the sword was
</p>
<p>suspended over me by a single thread  occasioned emotions
</p>
<p>so violent, that I cannot, to this day, recal them without a
</p>
<p>nervous shudder.
</p>
<p>My readers' own feelings, as they peruse what follows,
</p>
<p>will enable them to judge what I must have suffered.
</p>
<p>X.
</p>
<p>A certain impression, which I welcomed as a hope of
</p>
<p>safety and of Divine protection, seemed to come upon me,
</p>
<p>that this singular situation, which I had neither sought
</p>
<p>nor foreseen, was not the effect of chance. Besides, my
</p>
<p>occupation absorbed me so deeply, that I had sunk into a
</p>
<p>sort of calm  a calm inwardly troubled, it is true, and, as
</p>
<p>it were, convulsive. But when I perceived that the sitting
</p>
<p>was about to draw to a close, all my agitation was renewed.
</p>
<p>A deep terror took possession of all my senses ; after what I
</p>
<p>had heard and what I had done, I could not look for any

</p>
<p>mercy. At the noise which followed, when all the assembly
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 29
</p>
<p>rose from their seats, my knees knocked together, and
</p>
<p>drops of cold perspiration fell from my forehead.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, however much I resembled a condemned
</p>
<p>criminal whose hour of execution has arrived, I was not
</p>
<p>so wholly mastered by terror but that I had some lucid
</p>
<p>moments. I took advantage of the noise produced by
</p>
<p>their mutual congratulations to thrust my manuscripts into
</p>
<p>my stockings, and felt somewhat relieved when they were
</p>
<p>thus concealed. Afterwards, when the bottles were un
</p>
<p>corked, and the glasses were jingled, I exerted all the little
</p>
<p>force I had left to ease my torpid limbs ; for the posture I
</p>
<p>had been obliged so long to maintain had cramped my
</p>
<p>whole frame, especially my neck and my legs. Happily, the
</p>
<p>noise was now sufficient to allow me to stretch my limbs,
</p>
<p>and let my blood return to its natural circulation.
</p>
<p>This relief obtained, and the noise in the adjoining
</p>
<p>room having again subsided, the chief who had already
</p>
<p>spoken, addressed the following observations to his col
</p>
<p>leagues, who listened. with the renewed attention which his
</p>
<p>words seemed always to command.
</p>
<p>" Where is the revolutionist who, as soon as he becomes
</p>
<p>engaged in any plot, is not obliged to risk his fortune and
</p>
<p>his life? As for us, we have nothing of the kind to fear.
</p>
<p>On the contrary, those who load us with favours, to whom
</p>
<p>we owe these spacious mansions where we hold our meet
</p>
<p>ings in perfect safety, not only confide to us their sub
</p>
<p>ordinates and their families, but put themselves into our
</p>
<p>hands." These last words, uttered in a slightly ironical tone,
</p>
<p>excited an approving murmur, which induced the speaker
</p>
<p>to add :

<p>30 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>" But let us not trust too much to the singular advan
</p>
<p>tages of our admirable position. Let us rather take
</p>
<p>extreme care to avoid the least false step, so as to arrive
</p>
<p>safely at the result of our efforts."
</p>
<p>After these words there was an explosion of enthusiasm
</p>
<p> toast followed toast ; but nothing of the precise meaning
</p>
<p>of their noisy conversation reached me. The only words
</p>
<p>I heard distinctly were these which one of them, evidently
</p>
<p>English or Irish by his accent, pronounced in a grave
</p>
<p>sonorous voice, accenting each syllable impressively : " Et
</p>
<p>erit unum ovile, et unus pastor."
</p>
<p>Continually in fear of being discovered, I expected
</p>
<p>every instant to see the joyous scene of which I was the
</p>
<p>unknown witness, change into a scene of death. I looked
</p>
<p>anxiously around me  not a corner where I could conceal
</p>
<p>myself. I heard the rapid beating of my heart ; my fate
</p>
<p>seemed darker than the night whose approach rendered my
</p>
<p>thoughts still more gloomy. What a position ! I at once
</p>
<p>desired and feared a change, whatever it might be. I
</p>
<p>desired it, that I might be released from such cruel con
</p>
<p>straint ; I feared it, for what might befal me ! All at once
</p>
<p>a fortunate accident roused me from my stupor  the house
</p>
<p>bell rang. I heard these words, "Come, let us to supper;''
</p>
<p>followed by these others, " We have earned one, and a
</p>
<p>good one too."

</p>
<p>the door and were really going, I was seized with an agita-
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 31
</p>
<p>tion of quite a different nature from that which I had
</p>
<p>endured before. I cannot possibly express what I felt
</p>
<p>at this moment, when, listening attentively, I acquired the
</p>
<p>certainty that the room was becoming empty. It seemed
</p>
<p>to me that an overwhelming weight, which had oppressed
</p>
<p>me during half the day with a mysterious terror, was
</p>
<p>instantaneously taken away, as it were, by an invisible
</p>
<p>hand. Thenceforward, full of courage, I did not doubt that God
</p>
<p>had assisted me till then, and that he would continue to
</p>
<p>assist me.
</p>
<p>As soon as the sound of retreating steps had completely
</p>
<p>died away in the corridors, I crept softly into the apartment.
</p>
<p>- Even there I could not help casting a look on the table round
</p>
<p>which the assembly had been seated. The temptation was
</p>
<p>too strong for my curiosity not to overcome my fears. The
</p>
<p>first thing that struck me was some great books in the
</p>
<p>form of registers, with alphabeted edges. The sight of them
</p>
<p>explained to me a noise I had heard at the moment when
</p>
<p>the Jesuits entered. However, no use had been made of
</p>
<p>these books during the conference.
</p>
<p>Although at that hour I could scarcely see to read,
</p>
<p>yet I would not lose the opportunity of casting a rapid
</p>
<p>glance into these volumes. I found that they contained
</p>
<p>numerous observations relative to the character of distin
</p>
<p>guished individuals, arranged by towns or families. Each
</p>
<p>page was evidently written by several different hands.
</p>
<p>Beside these enormous volumes, I saw three unbound
</p>
<p>manuscript books, two in Italian, and one in French, all
</p>
<p>thickly set with marginal notes. If I had not been tor

</p>
<p>mented with strong apprehensions, I could have employed
</p>
<p>32 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>some precious time in looking through this mass of writings.
</p>
<p>But I had incurred peril enough, and however great the
</p>
<p>attraction, it was necessary to resist it, and depart without
</p>
<p>more delay.
</p>
<p>XII.
</p>
<p>What activity in this order !  what power of combina
</p>
<p>tion !  what boldness of views !  what fecundity of means !
</p>
<p>But also, what pride to imagine it possible, even with all
</p>
<p>these appliances, to delude, ensnare, mystify, and quell
</p>
<p>this rebellious age, which becomes each day more clear
</p>
<p>sighted to comprehend these plans, and perceive the defini
</p>
<p>tive object of these manoeuvres.
</p>
<p>Jesuitism, indeed, has long lain under the most terrible
</p>
<p>suspicions. Fra Paolo Sarpi, a man of great capacity, of con
</p>
<p>summate experience, a monk himself, and who, during a
</p>
<p>long life, had studied this amphibious sort of corporation
</p>
<p>(for it does not declare itself decidedly either ecclesiastic or
</p>
<p>monkish), calls it in his usual laconic language, " The
</p>
<p>secret of the court of Rome, and of all secrets the greatest."
</p>
<p>" Of all the religious orders," said likewise the formid
</p>
<p>able Philip II. , "that of the Jesuits is the only one which
</p>
<p>I cannot in the least comprehend."
</p>
<p>At the present day this society continues to be an
</p>
<p>enigma, but its meaning is on the point of being found
</p>
<p>out. One day during the last few years I opened the

<p>Revue des Deux-Mondes, and great was my surprise on
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 33
</p>
<p>finding there details very similar to those which I have
</p>
<p>just recounted, and of which, as I have already said, I made
</p>
<p>no mystery on my arrival in Switzerland. It is, neverthe
</p>
<p>less, possible, that the information contained in the following
</p>
<p>lines proceeded from another source: 
</p>
<p>" The provincial houses correspond with those of Paris ;
</p>
<p>they are also in direct communication with the general,
</p>
<p>who resides at Rome. The correspondence of the Jesuits,
</p>
<p>so active, so varied, and organized in so wonderful a man
</p>
<p>ner, has for object to furnish the chiefs with every infor
</p>
<p>mation of which they may stand in need. Every day the
</p>
<p>general receives a number of reports which severally check
</p>
<p>each other. There are in the central house, at Rome, huge
</p>
<p>registers, wherein are inscribed the names of all the Jesuits
</p>
<p>and of all the important persons, friends, or enemies, with
</p>
<p>whom they have any connexion. In those registers are
</p>
<p>recorded, without alteration, hate, or passion, facts relating
</p>
<p>to the lives of each individual. It is the most gigantic
</p>
<p>biographical collection that has ever been formed. The
</p>
<p>conduct of a light woman, the hidden failings of a statesman,
</p>
<p>are recounted in these books with cold impartiality ; written
</p>
<p>with an aim to usefulness, these biographies are necessarily
</p>
<p>genuine. When it is required to act in any way upon an
</p>
<p>individual, they open the book and become immediately
</p>
<p>acquainted with his life, his character, his qualities, his
</p>
<p>defects, his projects, his family, his friends, his most secret
</p>
<p>acquaintances. Can you not conceive, sir, what paramount
</p>
<p>practical advantages a society must enjoy that possesses this
</p>
<p>immense police register which embraces the whole world 1
</p>
<p>It is not on light grounds I speak of these registers, it is

<p>from one who has seen this collection, and who is perfectly
</p>
<p>34 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>acquainted with the Jesuits, that I derive my knowledge of
</p>
<p>this fact. It suggests matter for reflection for those
</p>
<p>families who give free access to the members of a com
</p>
<p>munity in which the study of biography is so adroitly
</p>
<p>cultivated and applied."
</p>
<p>I was forced, though with regret, to quit the table ;
</p>
<p>besides, the darkness prevented my reading profitably.
</p>
<p>I was under no difficulty about leaving the room ; I knew
</p>
<p>that the door opened on the inside, and that I should only
</p>
<p>have to shut it gently to reach the corridor. I thought it
</p>
<p>best not to go to my room, as it must have been shut up
</p>
<p>during my absence. What I most dreaded at that moment
</p>
<p>was to meet any one, for I was convinced that during this
</p>
<p>absence of half a day I had been anxiously sought for.
</p>
<p>The best expedient I could think of was to go and place
</p>
<p>myself in a latticed pew in the church, in which I
</p>
<p>attended mass every day accompanied by my guardian
</p>
<p>angel.
</p>
<p>XIII.
</p>
<p>Alone there, and in some degree safe, I had leisure to
</p>
<p>feel the full effects of the fatigue of body and mind I had
</p>
<p>endured. All my ideas had in fact undergone a complete
</p>
<p>revolution, which, had it been effected slowly, would not have
</p>
<p>had the serious consequences of which I am about to speak ;
</p>
<p>but it had taken place with extraordinary violence ; the tree
</p>
<p>had been torn up suddenly by the roots and cast upon the
</p>
<p>furious waters of a torrent. I will not attempt to describe

</p>
<p>such a situation ; at times I appreciated the event in all its
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 35
</p>
<p>reality ; at others the burning of my brain was such that I
</p>
<p>did not doubt I had been the sport of some Satanic vision ;
</p>
<p>I was present once more at the scene which I had
</p>
<p>witnessed, but it was now so exaggerated that I fancied I
</p>
<p>heard spectres or demons conversing together.
</p>
<p>Under a load of such different impressions of fear, of
</p>
<p>astonishment, my intellectual and moral strength broken
</p>
<p>by toil and constraint, after having yielded myself up to
</p>
<p>a maze of gloomy and agonizing thoughts, it was a good
</p>
<p>thing for me that I ^sank into a deep sleep. It must
</p>
<p>have been about nine or ten in the evening, when I was
</p>
<p>suddenly awakened by some one shouting out my name.
</p>
<p>Mechanically I came out of my pew, and was still rubbing
</p>
<p>my eyes when I know not how many fathers came round
</p>
<p>me. I was instantly overwhelmed with questions. I was
</p>
<p>obliged to pause some moments to collect my ideas ; and
</p>
<p>then I could find nothing better to say than that I had felt
</p>
<p>unwell  that everything fatigued me  that the slightest
</p>
<p>noise tortured me  and that I had retired there to be
</p>
<p>alone. But all this was far from satisfying them. Father
</p>
<p>Saetti remarked, that not only he had been where we then
</p>
<p>were, but that he had knocked at every door, even at that
</p>
<p>of the rector, without being able to find me.
</p>
<p>In fact, during the meeting I had heard the door open ;
</p>
<p>and so long as the whisperings lasted, and until it was
</p>
<p>shut again, I had felt a cold shudder run through my
</p>
<p>frame. I replied, therefore, that it was true I had not been

</p>
<p>constantly there ; that I had been absent for a quarter of
</p>
<p>36 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>an hour or so, and I mentioned a place to which I had
</p>
<p>been obliged to go.
</p>
<p>The embarrassment manifested in every word I spoke
</p>
<p>increased their suspicions. The fathers, irritated rather
</p>
<p>than appeased by my replies, continued, under different
</p>
<p>forms, to repeat the same interrogations.
</p>
<p>The guardian angel took; the trouble to inform me, in
</p>
<p>an ill-hurr.oured tone, that at first he had believed I
</p>
<p>had gone to make my request to the rector, but that my
</p>
<p>absence proving so long, he had changed his opinion. And
</p>
<p>as though he feared being accused of negligence, he justified
</p>
<p>himself in an eager and serious tone.
</p>
<p>" It was impossible for me to suppose," said he to the
</p>
<p>rector, " that even if you had received him you would
</p>
<p>have kept him so long  above all to-day, when, on account
</p>
<p>of the meeting, you had told me there would be no recep
</p>
<p>tion. It was only after having been more than once to
</p>
<p>inquire of the porter and of the lay brothers, after having
</p>
<p>importuned everybody, that I began to suspect he might
</p>
<p>have run away. It was then at the risk of disturbing your
</p>
<p>meeting, not knowing what to do, I came and knocked at
</p>
<p>your door. Before supper, I hastened to inform you of his
</p>
<p>disappearance, and, had it not been to obey you, I should,
</p>
<p>for my own part, have judged it perfectly useless to go
</p>
<p>calling him through the corridors as I have just done. I
</p>
<p>can scarcely believe my eyes at seeing him there now."
</p>
<p>There would have been no end to all this, if, wearied
</p>
<p>with so many questions, and making a bold effort, I had
</p>
<p>not begun to complain bitterly, groaning out that they
</p>
<p>tortured me, that I was exhausted , with suffering, that I

</p>
<p>An aged father, whom I recognised by his voice as
</p>
<p>one of those who had spoken during the meeting, suddenly
</p>
<p>cut short these puzzling interrogatories. " Let me see,"
</p>
<p>said he, taking hold of my hand and feeling my pulse,
</p>
<p>whilst the rest stood keenly watching me in silence ; then,
</p>
<p>after a few moments of serious thought, " Poor lad !"
</p>
<p>said he, " he is in a burning fever. To bed with him
</p>
<p>immediately ! let the physician see him at once ; I never
</p>
<p>in my life saw any one in such violent agitation ; he is in
</p>
<p>a tremendous fever." This was sufficient to put an end to
</p>
<p>their suspicions.
</p>
<p>XIV.
</p>
<p>My first care, on being conducted to my room, was to
</p>
<p>endeavour to undress without assistance. I contrived, not
</p>
<p>without difficulty, to lay my stockings aside without any
</p>
<p>other person touching them. The physician, who soon
</p>
<p>arrived, confirmed the opinion already pronounced on the
</p>
<p>serious nature of my attack.
</p>
<p>Wholly engrossed by the secret in my possession, as
</p>
<p>soon as I was left alone, notwithstanding the darkness and
</p>
<p>the deplorable state I was in, I opened the edge of one of
</p>
<p>my waistcoats with a penknife ; I then took my manu
</p>
<p>scripts, reduced them into small squares, and placed them
</p>
<p>carefully within the lining, so as to make no show that
</p>
<p>could betray their existence. I was obliged, however,
</p>
<p>to defer till the morrow the task of stitching up the waist
</p>
<p>coat. When my health was in some degree restored, and I

<p>38 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>had recovered my composure, I communicated to the rector
</p>
<p>my determination to discontinue my studies for the novi
</p>
<p>tiate. In this I was guilty of signal imprudence, and
</p>
<p>from that moment my intention of quitting the establish
</p>
<p>ment was represented to me as an inspiration of the devil.
</p>
<p>The pertinacity with which they strove to detain me,
</p>
<p>against my will, was so much the more odious to me, as
</p>
<p>they protested that all they sought was the welfare of my
</p>
<p>immortal soul. I found myself compelled some time longer
</p>
<p>to champ the bit in silence.
</p>
<p>The day of confession arrived. I had hitherto obeyed
</p>
<p>a rule which prescribed that the penitent should reply
</p>
<p>aloud to the questions of his confessor  a more efficacious
</p>
<p>means, it was said, of advancing in humility and of render
</p>
<p>ing the act of confession meritorious. This time I paid no
</p>
<p>attention to it. The rector remarked this, and severely
</p>
<p>reprimanded me. The fact is, that he never failed on the
</p>
<p>Saturday evening to place his chair against that very door
</p>
<p>which, on the day when I took my notes of the sitting,
</p>
<p>had remained partly open, and he seated himself in
</p>
<p>such a manner that my voice was necessarily directed
</p>
<p>towards the door. I was, meanwhile, kneeling on a sort
</p>
<p>of footstool, and my face nearly touched his. The know
</p>
<p>ledge I had acquired had rendered me suspicious. The
</p>
<p>care which he took to exhort me to speak louder, whilst
</p>
<p>the usual custom in confession is to whisper, called my
</p>
<p>attention to the door which was in front of me, and
</p>
<p>I examined it as carefully as my situation would permit.
</p>
<p>I perceived that it was slight, and composed of a
</p>
<p>number of narrow battens, with many small interstices

<p>between them. Of course, in my new frame of mind I
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 39
</p>
<p>could not help supposing that some mystery was hidden
</p>
<p>behind that door  that, perhaps, on the same spot where
</p>
<p>I had written down the proceedings of the meeting, on that
</p>
<p>very table, so well furnished with writing materials, a
</p>
<p>secretary took notes of all that was weekly elicited, by
</p>
<p>questions cunningly contrived so as to search out the
</p>
<p>inmost hearts of young men who would have scrupled to
</p>
<p>dissemble, in the solemn act of confession, even their most
</p>
<p>fugitive thoughts.
</p>
<p>XV.
</p>
<p>Let me now give an account of the contrary effect
</p>
<p>which was produced on me, in my present state, by those
</p>
<p>very things which had previously wrought upon me, as it
</p>
<p>were, by fascination.
</p>
<p>The devotional books I was made to read, the sighs
</p>
<p>and lamentations I heard uttered for the multitude of souls
</p>
<p>whom the world beguiles and corrupts, and, above all,
</p>
<p>these maxims, " That it is only by sacrificing our inclina
</p>
<p>tions that we can advance towards perfection; that inferiors
</p>
<p>ought to listen to their superiors as if God spoke by their
</p>
<p>lips ; that when we have become as a wand, or as a lifeless
</p>
<p>body in their hands, then only we have attained the height
</p>
<p>of obedience; and that this short life cannot be better
</p>
<p>employed than for the triumph of the church, and in
</p>
<p>seeking to bring all to her." These books, these sighs,
</p>
<p>these maxims appeared to me as nothing else than the
</p>
<p>means of an abominable deception.

</p>
<p>Nothing annoyed me so much as the pains they took
</p>
<p>40 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>to embue my gait, my gestures, and even my looks with a
</p>
<p>certain air of austerity, and to prune my habitual language
</p>
<p>of certain free and artless expressions, with a view to im
</p>
<p>pose others upon me, of a honied, specious, and sanctimo
</p>
<p>nious nature. To meditate for ever, in such a place as this,
</p>
<p>on the eternity of punishment, everlasting felicity, and
</p>
<p>the duty of putting off the old man and putting on the
</p>
<p>new, and to pass the beads of a chaplet daily through my
</p>
<p>fingers, were exercises incompatible thenceforward with the
</p>
<p>new life which I had received in that very place. But
</p>
<p>what consummated my disgust was to be compelled to par
</p>
<p>ticipate in conventional groanings, and in a pious loquacity
</p>
<p>of which it is impossible to form an idea. How, indeed,
</p>
<p>could I have continued to be at all deceived as to the
</p>
<p>nature of these practices ? I was now aware of their
</p>
<p>purpose. They hoped, by means of all their trash of
</p>
<p>hollow and heartless prayers, their fictitious ecstacies, and
</p>
<p>chimerical communion with God, to galvanize my imagi
</p>
<p>nation, to suppress a portion of my being, and by marring
</p>
<p>my reason to obscure and mutilate my understanding, so
</p>
<p>that they might at length become its absolute masters.
</p>
<p>The traces of the crisis through which I passed have
</p>
<p>been so profound, that no religious phraseology, however
</p>
<p>grand, has ever since been able to impose upon me. So
</p>
<p>far from being, in my estimation, a warrant of solid piety,
</p>
<p>a profusion of set phrases induces me rather to inquire
</p>
<p>whether it is not employed as an instrument of political
</p>
<p>views, or of self-interested speculation. I have become
</p>
<p>more and more averse from that heavy formality which
</p>
<p>almost everywhere stifles the fruitful principles of the

<p>gospel ; and I have good right to disapprove of and detest

</p>
<p>it, since I early encountered the most venomous of reptiles
</p>
<p>under its thick foliage. I know, indeed, of no better rule
</p>
<p>for judging of men and things than that given by Jesus :
</p>
<p>" A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, nor an evil
</p>
<p>tree good fruit. By their fruits ye shall know them."
</p>
<p>Convinced that the rector would never cease to oppose
</p>
<p>my departure, I matured a project of flight, and I chose
</p>
<p>for its execution what I thought the most favourable hour
</p>
<p>of the afternoon. I went immediately to the very hotel at
</p>
<p>which, a short time before, I had dined with the arch-priest,
</p>
<p>the day of my entrance into the novitiate. From thence I
</p>
<p>sent to the establishment for whatever belonged to me.
</p>
<p>One of the fathers immediately came to me, and exerted all
</p>
<p>his eloquence to convince me that I had committed a
</p>
<p>heinous fault ; but it was in vain he protested that salvation
</p>
<p>is scarcely to be attained by those who mingle in the
</p>
<p>world's ways, whereas if we die in the society it is assured
</p>
<p>to us, according to the promise of St. Ignatius  I was no
</p>
<p>longer the man to give heed to such fables. Abstaining
</p>
<p>from all imprudent disclosures, and avoiding every symptom
</p>
<p>of rancour, I at length dismissed my persevering visitor,
</p>
<p>and now I thought only of returning to my parents. A
</p>
<p>physician, whom I found it necessary to consult, advised
</p>
<p>me to avoid the motion of a carriage, and to travel rather
</p>
<p>by boat upon the Po. It is astonishing how the eager
</p>
<p>desire to quit this place, and the joy of breathing the
</p>
<p>free air, took away all feeling of the indisposition under
</p>
<p>which I was still labouring. But scarcely had I proceeded
</p>
<p>six or seven leagues by water ere my illness increased so
</p>
<p>much, that when I was landed at Casala I was considered
</p>
<p>to be in danger. I was therefore compelled to remain at

<p>that place until I was able to be removed to Langosco,
</p>
<p>my native town.
</p>
<p>Amidst so many trials it was, however, a consolation
</p>
<p>to me that throughout this perilous affair I had avoided
</p>
<p>the worst of all evils, that of betraying myself. In the
</p>
<p>height of the fever, brought on by all I had gone through,
</p>
<p>every word I uttered had some confused reference to the
</p>
<p>meeting of which I had made a minute. I had to strive
</p>
<p>against this tendency of my disorder, and so great was the
</p>
<p>struggle, that I suffered from the effects of it for more
</p>
<p>than a year. The strangeness of the event, and the fear

<p>of betraying my own share in it, had deranged my whole

<p>being.

<p>experienced anything but good treatment  all these things

<p>were to him totally inexplicable. Those who compared my

</p>
<p>contributed not a little to make it appear that I was in the

</p>
<p>wrong. But the greatest grief I felt on this occasion
</p>
<p>was that he who had hitherto loved me as his son, so that
</p>
<p>we could not pass a day without seeking each other's
</p>
<p>society, now shut his door against me, declaring, with
</p>
<p>indignant severity, that for the future he would have
</p>
<p>nothing to do with me. This was my old friend the cure.
</p>
<p>And in fact he had witnessed in me so much resistance
</p>
<p>overcome, so many sacrifices made, so many ties, and those
</p>
<p>the dearest, broken, that he could not but consider my
</p>
<p>vocation as a strong and decided one. It appeared unpar
</p>
<p>donable in his eyes that I should have no reason to allege
</p>
<p>for the suddenness of the change, none to justify my flight ;
</p>
<p>and nothing could exasperate him more than the utter apathy
</p>
<p>I showed with regard to the Jesuits, after having been one
</p>
<p>of their most ardent admirers ; an apathy which I could
</p>
<p>not disguise, although it rendered my conduct still more
</p>
<p>enigmatical. All this kept us asunder during several
</p>
<p>years, and even when our reconciliation at last took
</p>
<p>place, he could not refrain from treating me as inconstant,
</p>
<p>unreasonable, flighty, and paradoxical. In fact he only
</p>
<p>consented to receive me again on condition that not a word
</p>
<p>should be said on all this affair.

</p>
<p>I will now give an idea of the conduct which I was

<p>obliged to adopt, in order to make my way in the clerical

<p>rally the pages I possessed were the frequent subject of my

</p>
<p>meditations. Instead of being influenced by official
</p>
<p>44 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>instruction, I soon became sensible that, in my case, it
</p>
<p>only served as an antidote against itself. I thus preserved
</p>
<p>my thoughts from pursuing the common track. But a
</p>
<p>crowd of reflections were awakened within me on all that I
</p>
<p>saw, and these I was absolutely forced to suppress. To
</p>
<p>form an idea of what all this cost me, it would be necessary
</p>
<p>to make a close acquaintance with life in a seminary.
</p>
<p>Reciprocal mistrust is the first lesson taught there;
</p>
<p>servility is recommended as the height of virtue ; espionage
</p>
<p>is noble, everything is pardoned to him who practises it,
</p>
<p>whilst the greatest implacability is shown towards him who
</p>
<p>dares to call it a base occupation. The doctrine of pride
</p>
<p>is also carried to its greatest height in the opinion which
</p>
<p>the priest is taught to form of his own dignity. He is told
</p>
<p>to consider himself as no less superior to the laity than man
</p>
<p>is to the brute. He is told that he must not be familiar
</p>
<p>with the people ; that he must maintain a certain distancein
</p>
<p>order to be the more imposing, and the better to inculcate the
</p>
<p>superiority of the church, or (which comes to the same
</p>
<p>thing) of the clergy. The students in these ecclesiastical
</p>
<p>establishments, almost all of the poorer classes, shiink from
</p>
<p>no sacrifice, because they are sustained by the hope of
</p>
<p>improving their condition. Yes, all that is sought, with
</p>
<p>such concentrated eagerness, under the semblance of this
</p>
<p>plausible mechanism of worship, is, in plain truth, a position
</p>
<p>more or less brilliant  a trade, in fact, by which to live.
</p>
<p>Such is the mainspring of this machinery, and it does not
</p>
<p>fail to keep all in movement. And to say the truth, who
</p>
<p>ever has eyes to see and ears to hear, can feel no doubt
</p>
<p>that this is the means employed to influence, modify,

<p>transform, render subservient, or stifle, if need be, opinions,
</p>

</p>
<p>ideas, and systems. So that the greater number of young
</p>
<p>men, who are brought by instruction to admit these ready-
</p>
<p>made convictions, and who are incapable of a free and
</p>
<p>magnanimous resolution, easily lend themselves to certain
</p>
<p>functions in the Catholic hierarchy, and each works at his
</p>
<p>appointed hour, and in his appointed place, with surprising
</p>
<p>readiness and regularity.
</p>
<p>When my eyes had once begun to penetrate all these
</p>
<p>combinations, and their unavoidable results, I perceived
</p>
<p>within myself symptoms of another revolution. Every
</p>
<p>amusement was insipid to me ; and my soul, early awakened,
</p>
<p>and yet imprisoned in a little world, an epitome of all that
</p>
<p>is stirring in the great world, set itself to work secretly to
</p>
<p>discuss a multitude of questions, delicate in their nature,
</p>
<p>and difficult to solve. I was in a situation every way
</p>
<p>exceptional. I was like a person who is placed behind the
</p>
<p>curtain during a scenic representation, and who witnesses
</p>
<p>the play of the wires. Thus, the pomp and show of
</p>
<p>religion, its fetes, liturgies, solemnities, and devotional
</p>
<p>practices, inspired me with nothing short of repugnance.
</p>
<p>But forced to submit to circumstances, with my eye fixed
</p>
<p>upon a multitude of figures, and on the concealed springs
</p>
<p>which put them in movement, I shrank, pensively, within
</p>
<p>myself. This, however, I will say, that notwithstanding all
</p>
<p>the obligations which I felt were imposed upon me by my
</p>
<p>situation, neither the sermons at chapel, nor the weekly
</p>
<p>gymnastics to which I was forced to resign myself, in order
</p>
<p>to be one of the actors in the insipid exhibition of high
</p>
<p>mass, nor the act of confession and its monthly certifi
</p>
<p>cates, nor all the constraint imposed by constant espionage,

</p>
<p>operated in the same manner upon me that it did upon
</p>
<p>46 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>others. It roused within me a rebellious feeling, instead of
</p>
<p>rendering me docile to receive the common stamp.
</p>
<p>Alone, as it were, amongst a great number of fellow-
</p>
<p>students, almost unconnected with them, on account of my
</p>
<p>eccentricity and isolation, I was compelled to have recourse
</p>
<p>to whatever change or occupation I could procure, in order
</p>
<p>to render my situation supportable. I ransacked all the
</p>
<p>works that came within the limits of the prescribed rules,
</p>
<p>in the hope of appeasing my thirst of knowledge, and for
</p>
<p>want of larger resources, my mind was absorbed in reason
</p>
<p>ing and reflection. I deeply studied (and this was the
</p>
<p>source of much reproach to me) a Latin Bible, divided into
</p>
<p>small volumes, one of which I always had about me.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the orchestra poured forth its anthems, the
</p>
<p>altar shone resplendent with gold, the bishop enthroned
</p>
<p>himself with his scenic adornments ; they knelt, they
</p>
<p>bowed, they waved the censers, they chanted, they stunned
</p>
<p>the ears, and dazzled the eyes; whilst I, in order to detach
</p>
<p>myself, as much as possible, from all this mechanical mum
</p>
<p>mery, gladly abandoned my seat at the feast, always fur
</p>
<p>nished on days of extraordinary ceremony, to those who
</p>
<p>were well contented to take my place ; that is to say, to
</p>
<p>any of those beings as fond of these ceremonies as they
</p>
<p>were stupid and greedy.
</p>
<p>My antipathy for these material forms of worship be
</p>
<p>came generally perceived, and produced considerable scan
</p>
<p>dal. I felt, meanwhile, an increasing ardour in the study
</p>
<p>of the Prophets and of the New Testament, in order to
</p>
<p>acquaint myself perfectly with the type of doctrine and
</p>
<p>the plan of redemption which they contain. If I con

<p>evident repugnance, that my fellow -actors were both
</p>
<p>amused and angry ; so extremely susceptible are priests in
</p>
<p>all that relates to their ceremonies.
</p>
<p>Such was the effect upon me of the event which I have
</p>
<p>related ; and I was compelled to maintain a daily and
</p>
<p>hourly struggle with the desire I felt to communicate it.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all my reserve, however, involuntary
</p>
<p>glimpses of revelation from time to time escaped me, like
</p>
<p>flashes of lightning, and excited surprise and alarm in
</p>
<p>some for whom I had the greatest respect and love ; so
</p>
<p>that they began to look upon me as an inexplicable anomaly,
</p>
<p>and I became conviriced that my only hope of safety was
</p>
<p>to preserve the most rigorous silence.

</p>
<p>My studies being terminated, I applied for ordination.
</p>
<p>And now I was made sensible of the obstacles I had to
</p>
<p>expect. I observed in all those who directed the semi
</p>
<p>nary, not excepting the rector himself, a determination to
</p>
<p>stop my progress. I begged of them to inform me what
</p>
<p>were the motives of their refusal, and to say in what my
</p>
<p>conduct had given them offence ? They replied, that I
</p>
<p>had no taste for religious ceremonies, and that, consequently,
</p>
<p>I had no vocation for the church ; that I read too much,
</p>
<p>and that they could not understand me. As they persisted
</p>
<p>in their refusal, a canon, highly placed, who had long been

<p>my confessor, a man of a singular and complex character,
</p>
<p>48 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>procured me an introduction to Grimaldi, archbishop of
</p>
<p>Vercelli. When I represented to him the deplorable
</p>
<p>ignorance and the scandalous immorality of many of the
</p>
<p>pupils of the seminary, who had been received into holy
</p>
<p>orders by the influence of certain personages, and even by
</p>
<p>that of certain ladies, whilst those who were questioned as
</p>
<p>to my conduct had not a word of reproach to bring for
</p>
<p>ward, he was obliged to intrench himself behind a custom
</p>
<p>which exists of never accepting a candidate who is
</p>
<p>opposed by his superiors.
</p>
<p>I recount these details in order to show that the
</p>
<p>superiors with whom I had to do were unable to compre
</p>
<p>hend my character. They were anxious to interdict me
</p>
<p>from ever entering into the Catholic sanctuary ; but they
</p>
<p>were unable to find an effectual pretext. The archbishop
</p>
<p>owned himself, at length, dissatisfied with mere suspicions,
</p>
<p>vague accusations, and gratuitous assertions of the difficulty
</p>
<p>of ascertaining my tendencies.
</p>
<p>One of the many proofs I could furnish, that the sin
</p>
<p>gular secret of which I was possessor influenced all my
</p>
<p>views and directed all my proceedings, is, that as soon as 1
</p>
<p>had succeeded in obtaining ordination, I took my departure
</p>
<p>for Turin. In one of the intervals of the secret conference, during
</p>
<p>which the Jesuits relaxed themselves by a little familiar
</p>
<p>conversation, I had heard the theologian Guala spoken of
</p>
<p>as an ecclesiastic very serviceable to their plans. No
</p>
<p>sooner, then, was I at liberty to pursue my own projects,
</p>
<p>than I endeavoured to procure an introduction to him.

<p>and he conforms, in all things, to the views of the Jesuits,
</p>
<p>whom he considers as models of perfection. His morality
</p>
<p>is theirs.
</p>
<p>XIX.
</p>
<p>What most struck me, on my entrance into this con
</p>
<p>gregation, was the chief himself. Small of stature, of great
</p>
<p>activity, with a most penetrating eye, inflexible with the
</p>
<p>little, and supple with the great, I beheld him every morning
</p>
<p>besieged, both at his own residence and at the confessional,
</p>
<p>by the most influential and the most distinguished persons
</p>
<p>of both sexes whom the city possesses.
</p>
<p>Every week, at an appointed time, priests, young and
</p>
<p>old, crowded into a vast hall, and a conference took place,
</p>
<p>in which this theologian and his colleagues, all spiritual
</p>
<p>directors of the highest families, conducted the discussion
</p>
<p>of cases of conscience. For myself, all my attention was
</p>
<p>applied to study the tactics employed to furnish young con
</p>
<p>fessors with rules not only different, but absolutely opposed
</p>
<p>to each other, and to teach them how to use them. I
</p>
<p>acquired also the clearest conviction that the supreme art
</p>
<p>of the confessional is, to utilize for the church, that is, for
</p>
<p>the clerical hierarchy, sins and crimes of every species.
</p>
<p>Casuistry, like a Proteus, for ever displayed itself to my
</p>
<p>eyes under varying colours. The waving willow branch
</p>
<p>is not more flexible than are these doctors in their princi
</p>
<p>ples of morality.
</p>
<p>Every young priest is at liberty to play, by turns, the
</p>
<p>part of confessor and that of penitent. In the latter case,

<p>part of statesman, marquis, countess, or man or woman of
</p>
<p>the lower classes, he simulates the passions and adven
</p>
<p>tures of all ages, sexes, and conditions. I listened with
</p>
<p>particular attention to the mentors, aged men of great
</p>
<p>experience, when they corrected the apprentice-confessors ;
</p>
<p>not a word did I suffer to escape me of the many which

</p>
<p>the nature of the language which they were to employ with
</p>
<p>the several classes of society.
</p>
<p>But it is from a number of anecdotes, from conversa
</p>
<p>tions, from words let fall in public, or confidentially, from
</p>
<p>manuscripts which were only confided to trustworthy per

<p>sons, that I acquired the certainty that the hidden designs
</p>
<p>of the Jesuits are executed by the aid of a multitude of
</p>
<p>adherents, who are entirely ignorant of the power that acts
</p>
<p>upon them, but are governed by others, who appear to
</p>
<p>know something of it, but in different degrees.
</p>
<p>This same theologian, who had at his disposal benefices

<p>small and great, from the humblest offices up to mitred
</p>
<p>ones, succeeded, with great skill, in presenting himself to
</p>
<p>my selection when he learned that I was engaged in the
</p>
<p>choice of a confessor. My confession, genuine at first, was
</p>
<p>soon changed into a sort of conversation that had no rela
</p>
<p>tion to it, as a religious act. He, nevertheless, required
</p>
<p>that, every Sunday, the priests whose director he was
</p>
<p>should not fail to kneel before him at the hours when the
</p>
<p>church was most crowded : it is not difficult to guess the
</p>
<p>motive for such an exhibition.

<p>He little suspected, however, that instead of studying
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 51
</p>
<p>me, as he proposed, he was giving me ample and continual
</p>
<p>subject for the study of himself.
</p>
<p>Everything had, indeed, concurred to enable me gradu
</p>
<p>ally to penetrate the system which was carried on. I was
</p>
<p>not imposed upon by the numerous equipages which crowded
</p>
<p>round his door, and by the assemblage of persons of conse
</p>
<p>quence, and ladies of rank, who waited upon him.
</p>
<p>In this place, where the Jesuits, thanks to their devoted
</p>
<p>auxiliary, train up the clergy according to their views, I
</p>
<p>was more successful in my researches than I could have
</p>
<p>hoped. I was even so fortunate as to surprise miracles
</p>
<p>in their very germs  to learn how they are wrought up
</p>
<p>and brought to perfection  how they are introduced on
</p>
<p>the scene, and used as a lever for the accomplishment of

<p>ulterior projects.
</p>
<p>I might have established myself in this congregation,

<p>and have counted, if I had chosen to make my court to

<p>him, on the credit of so powerful a protector. He did all
</p>
<p>in his power to inoculate me with his own ideas ; but
</p>
<p>quackery, which in general deserves only contempt, ought
</p>
<p>to be more than despised in the church. An attendance
</p>
<p>of one year on this able and wealthy casuist, was enough
</p>
<p>to enable me to appreciate not only himself but his troops
</p>
<p>of adorers. I now determined to quit this place, in order to
</p>
<p>pursue my investigations on a larger scale. I therefore

</p>
<p>XX.
</p>
<p>I will not conceal a strong temptation, which, for a
</p>
<p>while, diverted me from the path I had laid down for
</p>
<p>myself. Seeing the rapid elevation of certain individuals of
</p>
<p>wretched abilities, who seemed to defy me as incapable of
</p>
<p>rivalling them, I was more than once on the point of making
</p>
<p>use of the secret of the Jesuits, as a sort of itinerary, in
</p>
<p>order to arrive, by a shorter way, at a respectable position
</p>
<p>in the ecclesiastical career.
</p>
<p>This temptation did not last long, though I was often
</p>
<p>taken hardly to task by my father and his friends, sometimes
</p>
<p>because I devoted myself to the study of the bible and of the
</p>
<p>fathers of the church (a study which, I was assured, would be
</p>
<p>without any utility either immediate or remote); sometimes
</p>
<p>because I had declared my fixed determination never to
</p>
<p>aspire to any appointment or any honour whatsoever.
</p>
<p>Thus circumstanced, I felt that I must renounce my design
</p>
<p>of future expatriation, or make up my mind not to shrink
</p>
<p>from any kind of mortification. Happily for me, as my
</p>
<p>ardour increased to explore the foundations upon which
</p>
<p>Catholicism is built, my eyes became gradually opened, and
</p>
<p>I discerned more distinctly in what a mass of dogmatical,
</p>
<p>moral, and historical errors I had been brought up. This
</p>
<p>led me to conclude that it was not only a small portion of
</p>
<p>the Catholic hierarchy, as I had previously supposed, whose
</p>
<p>infection was dangerous, but the whole hierarchy itself,
</p>
<p>which, by its doctrines and by its aim, perverted the pre

</p>
<p>cepts of Christ, and pursued a course entirely repugnant to
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 53
</p>
<p>His teachings. And, in good truth, although the Catholic
</p>
<p>church, inscribing in its calendar, and in the breviary of its
</p>
<p>priests, the names of the doctors of the first six centuries,
</p>
<p>constitutes them  (strange fiction!)  the columns of the
</p>
<p>church, declares them its organs, and worships them as its
</p>
<p>saints, we may, nevertheless, boldly affirm, when we know
</p>
<p>these fathers more intimately than by their names, and
</p>
<p>when we have weighed their writings, that they all, one
</p>
<p>after another, bring their portion of gunpowder and place it
</p>
<p>under the edifice of degenerated Catholicism ; and in such
</p>
<p>abundant quantity, that there is a thousand times more than
</p>
<p>enough to blow up the whole and reduce it to dust.
</p>
<p>XXI.
</p>
<p>The examination which I thus made naturally inspired
</p>
<p>me with the desire to make another, equally useful and
</p>
<p>important. I desired to know all that passed in other seminaries, in
</p>
<p>the different brotherhoods, in the cloisters, in tbe houses of
</p>
<p>the cures, but above all, in the dwellings of the superior
</p>
<p>clergy. Thus, there is no labour which I was not willing
</p>
<p>to undertake in order to penetrate all the springs and all the
</p>
<p>combinations by which, even in our times, though it be not
</p>
<p>in the same manner as formerly, the Catholic organization
</p>
<p>can boast of being endowed both with a boundless elasticity,
</p>
<p>and an inflexible rigidity that no other has ever possessed,
</p>
<p>or perhaps ever will.
</p>
<p>On this account, I do not, therefore, regret the pains I

</p>
<p>I could not, however, fail to perceive that, in conse
</p>
<p>quence of the social condition of my country, I should at
</p>
<p>last become exposed to unpleasant consequences, should the
</p>
<p>least suspicion be entertained as to the twofold direction of
</p>
<p>my inquiries. I thought it necessary, on this account, to
</p>
<p>carry on, under a literary veil, my dogmatical and historical
</p>
<p>researches, and above all, those which I carried into the
</p>
<p>the domain of contemporary religion. I have always had
</p>
<p>an inclination for poetry and the fine arts. Availing myself
</p>
<p>therefore of this tendency, I let it be generally understood
</p>
<p>that the cultivation of letters was my ruling passion. This
</p>
<p>expedient, far from being an obstacle to the exploratory work
</p>
<p>which I had undertaken, furnished me, on the contrary, by
</p>
<p>the intercourse it procured me with persons of all classes, with
</p>
<p>numberless opportunities of appreciating the progress of the
</p>
<p>occult ideas of the Jesuits, whilst I seemed to be amusing
</p>
<p>myself with matters of trivial import.
</p>
<p>Monks of every hue came frequently and eagerly to visit
</p>
<p>me, for sake of the sermons which I dictated to them.
</p>
<p>Assiduous reading of every kind had rendered this sort of
</p>
<p>improvisation easy to me. These men were open-mouthed
</p>
<p>beyond all conception, and they made me the depository of
</p>
<p>all they knew. Good easy men they were for the most
</p>
<p>part, but never having passed the bounds of monkish
</p>
<p>instruction, they were profoundly ignorant of the true nature
</p>
<p>of the system by which they were passively swayed. Each
</p>
<p>of them, in fact, might be regarded, in his degree, as a
</p>
<p>compendium of what passes within the cloister, and of the
</p>
<p>doctrines which are there taught.
</p>
<p>I strove to make myself acquainted with the methods

</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 55
</p>
<p>Some of the oldest, and the most noted for strictness in the
</p>
<p>confessional, told me what strange concessions are made by
</p>
<p>the Jesuits to certain consciences ; and their anger was
</p>
<p>sometimes aroused when they related to me the efforts, too
</p>
<p>often useless, which they were forced to make against such
</p>
<p>a powerful means of seduction.
</p>
<p>In this manner I gradually acquired clearer views, not
</p>
<p>only as to the Christian scheme, but also as to that no less
</p>
<p>mysterious enigma, the purpose of modern Catholicism. I
</p>
<p>saw it unfold itself by degrees, and I became convinced that
</p>
<p>both in the secular and regular clergy, and in the higher
</p>
<p>and lower classes of society, a metamorphosis was taking
</p>
<p>place in accordance with the views of the Jesuits.
</p>
<p>How many phrases of the secret conference, which had
</p>
<p>appeared to me as mere momentary ebullitions, and flights
</p>
<p>of Utopian hyperbole wholly out of place in times like ours,
</p>
<p>recurred forcibly to my memory when facts themselves
</p>
<p>came forth as commentaries upon them ! As yet unlearned
</p>
<p>in the complication of human affairs, I had long regarded
</p>
<p>as impracticable the mode of action which the Jesuits had
</p>
<p>proposed to themselves in their secret meeting, in order to
</p>
<p>get the mastery over both people and aristocracy, by
</p>
<p>bringing them under the influence of the most opposite
</p>
<p>doctrines. But experience, acquired in the world of
</p>
<p>the great and in the world of the little, convinced me
</p>
<p>that I had been mistaken in classing this method amongst

</p>
<p>I frequently had occasion to appreciate the incomparable
</p>
<p>talent displayed by the Jesuits in making tools of young
</p>
<p>girls, silly women, domestics, devout ladies, and old men,
</p>
<p>towards the accomplishment of unlooked for results. How
</p>
<p>ever small may be each success they obtain, they use it to
</p>
<p>obtain greater still. How often have they, by means of
</p>
<p>such instruments, overthrown their surprised and astounded
</p>
<p>adversaries. How many individuals, left stationary notwithstanding
</p>
<p>their capacity, and witnessing with irritation and disgust
</p>
<p>the rapid and unmerited elevation of others to honourable
</p>
<p>and lucrative appointments, have 1 seen at last enrol them
</p>
<p>selves among the adherents of the Jesuits ! This miracle
</p>
<p>is followed by another. As no one likes to keep up an
</p>
<p>incessant struggle with an obstinate and vigorous enemy,
</p>
<p>the rage by which they were tortured up to the very
</p>
<p>moment when they yielded, becomes appeased ; their secret
</p>
<p>feelings of scorn and hatred die away, and at last they grow
</p>
<p>zealous for a cause which formerly inspired them with in
</p>
<p>dignation. Thus, the secret of this society consists in
</p>
<p>subduing, either by caresses or by the weariness of useless
</p>
<p>resistance when caresses have failed, the more enlightened
</p>
<p>of the middle classes, and in threatening them in their
</p>
<p>means of existence.

<p>The influential classes, under the persuasion that their
</p>
<p>interests can nowhere be safer than in the hands of the
</p>
<p>Jesuits, place them there, little suspecting the marvellous

<p>bestowed upon them into so many springs to advance a

<p>cause whose success would be followed by the ruin of those
</p>
<p>classes themselves.
</p>
<p>The following are the conditions  few, indeed, but
</p>
<p>peremptory  which they take care to enforce in every
</p>
<p>country where they are favoured by the government.
</p>
<p>They insist that people shall confess to them, and par
</p>
<p>ticipate as frequently as possible in the festivals of their
</p>
<p>churches ; that they shall augment the number of their
</p>
<p>adherents, become children of Mary, praise the order
</p>
<p>always and everywhere, and stick at nothing in order to
</p>
<p>be useful to it. It is only on these terms that their pro
</p>
<p>tection can be obtained.
</p>
<p>All who know the mask it was necessary to assume, in
</p>
<p>France, under the fallen dynasty, in order to assure success
</p>
<p>in any career, have no need to be told these things. Be^
</p>
<p>sides, do not the apologists themselves of the Jesuits avow
</p>
<p>that the latter have always possessed, in an inconceivable
</p>
<p>degree, " the art of spreading and accrediting the ideas

<p>which are subservient to their views, and that of compelling

<p>creasing triumph of dissimulation and hypocrisy. Had not
</p>
<p>my presence been necessary to my father, whom it would
</p>
<p>have been criminal to forsake in his almost continual state
</p>
<p>of infirmity, I should have gladly made every sacrifice in
</p>
<p>order to escape the spectacle of the abject servitude to
</p>
<p>which the clergy was already reduced, and which the laity
</p>
<p>was beginning to partake. I waited with a feeling like
</p>
<p>suffocation until I should be free. No sooner, then,
</p>
<p>had the death of my father taken place, than I made
</p>
<p>the necessary preparations to expatriate myself, taking
</p>
<p>care, meanwhile, that no one should suspect my real in
</p>
<p>tentions. I determined, however, to take a last farewell of my
</p>
<p>friend the cure, and of the instructor of my early years.
</p>
<p>Each of them, the more tenacious as he was entirely igno

<p>rant of my views, blamed my aversion for an advancement

<p>in the church, which was the object of so much eager

<p>ambition to others. When I announced to them that they

<p>would, in all probability, see me no more, they deplored

<p>what they were accustomed to call my inexplicable ob

<p>stinacy. The singular determination which I took drew upon

<p>upon he gave me, of his own accord, a letter of recom-
</p>

</p>
<p>mendation to the police, so that there might be no difficulty
</p>
<p>as to their granting me a passport.
</p>
<p>I must here remark, before I take leave of this epoch
</p>
<p>of my life, that belonging as I did to that portion of the
</p>
<p>clergy which was reputed liberal, I should have paid dearly
</p>
<p>for my principles had I committed any one tangible indiscre
</p>
<p>tion ; for there is nothing in that unhappy country which
</p>
<p>is attacked so mercilessly as new ideas, whether religious
</p>
<p>or political, more particularly when they are professed by
</p>
<p>ecclesiastics. I was, however, sufficiently fortunate to quit
</p>
<p>Piedmont without having become the object of any perse
</p>
<p>cution, or even disapprobation.
</p>
<p>XXIV.
</p>
<p>No sooner did I find myself in the beautiful land of
</p>
<p>Helvetia, than the recollections which belong to it crowded
</p>
<p>on my mind. I thought, in my simplicity, that I should
</p>
<p>now find but one standard, and all hearts universally de
</p>
<p>voted to liberty  to that liberty which the gospel proclaims
</p>
<p>and consecrates, and of which it is the great charter to the
</p>
<p>human race.
</p>
<p>But, as I have already hinted, a number of facts con
</p>
<p>curred to open my eyes speedily to a state of things which
</p>
<p>I had been far from anticipating. The explanations given
</p>
<p>in the introduction render it unnecessary that I should
</p>
<p>enter here upon the details of my sojourn at Geneva, upon
</p>
<p>the disappointments which there awaited me, and upon the

</p>
<p>lectures on the Secret Plan of the Jesuits which I had
</p>
<p>60 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>occasion to deliver to a number of persons there. Amongst
</p>
<p>the reflections suggested by these lectures, there is one
</p>
<p>which I consider worthy to be noted.
</p>
<p>It was observed to me, that the father of whom I have
</p>
<p>already spoken, he who opened the conference by an
</p>
<p>address to his colleagues, expressed himself like one having
</p>
<p>authority. He evidently took the lead, and all the others
</p>
<p>showed much deference for him. His expressions and his
</p>
<p>deportment would seem to indicate that he was himself the
</p>
<p>restorer of the occult society, and that he directed it as
</p>
<p>chief mover ; for neither did his language nor that of the
</p>
<p>others give the slightest indication that he was in any way
</p>
<p>dependent on any superiors.
</p>
<p>It thus appears probable that the president of the
</p>
<p>meeting at Chieri was the general of the Jesuits.
</p>
<p>Now, at this period, the general of the order was no
</p>
<p>other than Father Fortis, the same who, when Pius VII. con
</p>
<p>ceived the project of introducing some innovations into the
</p>
<p>articles of the Jesuitical constitutions, repeated these memo
</p>
<p>rable words, " Sint ut sunt, aut non sint."
</p>
<p>It is to this reply, first addressed to Clement XIV. by
</p>
<p>Father Ricci, general of the company, that Archbishop de
</p>
<p>Pradt alludes, when, recapitulating his ideas on this invinci
</p>
<p>ble society, he thus expresses himself: 
</p>
<p>"Heavens! what an institution is this! Was there
</p>
<p>ever one so powerful amongst men ! How, in fact, has
</p>
<p>Jesuitism lived ? How has it fallen ? Like the Titans, it
</p>
<p>yielded only to the combined thunderbolts of all the gods
</p>
<p>of the earthly Olympus. Did the aspect of death damp its
</p>
<p>courage ? Did it yield one step ? Let us be what we are,

<p>it said, or let us be no longer. This was truly to die
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 61
</p>
<p>standing, like the emperors, and according to the precept
</p>
<p>of one of the masters of the world."*
</p>
<p>Before I close this portion of my history, I ought,
</p>
<p>perhaps, to reply to certain scruples.
</p>
<p>The double case of conscience to which I am about to
</p>
<p>refer, has been discussed in those ecclesiastical conferences
</p>
<p>of which I have already had occasion to speak, as means of
</p>
<p>forming the apprentices to the confessional.
</p>
<p>Supposing that some one knows, either by private
</p>
<p>intelligence or as an accomplice, that there is a plot to set a
</p>
<p>town on fire, may he, notwithstanding his oath of secrecy,
</p>
<p>give information to the authorities, in order that they may
</p>
<p>take the necessary measures of prevention ? Would it be
</p>
<p>lawful for the confessor, who might be informed of the fact,
</p>
<p>to take, notwithstanding the sacramental seal upon his lips,
</p>
<p>the needful steps to prevent so great a catastrophe ?
</p>
<p>Supposing that a conspiracy existed, the success of
</p>
<p>which would bring ruin on a kingdom, might it, in spite of
</p>
<p>all imaginable oaths to secrecy, be revealed by a conspirator,
</p>
<p>or by the confessor himself ? Yes. I have heard it laid
</p>
<p>down by the most profound casuists, that where the general
</p>
<p>good is in question oaths are in no way binding in such
</p>
<p>cases as these.
</p>
<p>Now, besides that I am bound by no promise, I may
</p>
<p>boldly affirm that it is not an individual that is here at
</p>
<p>stake, or a town, or a kingdom, but the far more important
</p>
<p>interests of civilization and of the gospel itself, which is
</p>
<p>alone able, by the force of truth, to transform this
</p>
<p>vicious civilization, and to substitute for it that Kingdom

<p>of God whose coming we daily invoke in our Christian
</p>
<p>prayers. I may, I think, safely add that there is not a single
</p>
<p>person placed in like circumstances with me, who would not
</p>
<p>have been, like me, impelled by the force of a multitude of
</p>
<p>incidents, whose rapid succession left me not a moment for
</p>
<p>reflection. Embarrassment, agitation, indecision, terror, by
</p>
<p>turns incited and restrained me, and compelled me to act
</p>
<p>like a man whose eyes are blindfolded, and who knows not
</p>
<p>whither he is going. In fact it was impossible for me to act
</p>
<p>otherwise than as I did ; and I will add, in order to conceal
</p>
<p>nothing, that it would have been equally impossible for me
</p>
<p>afterwards to resist the yearning I constantly felt to search
</p>
<p>into everything that had the slightest connection with those
</p>
<p>Jesuitical revelations which were ever present to my mind.
</p>
<p>What I am, intellectually and morally, all my researches and

<p>all my ulterior labours, all the materials which I possess 
</p>
<p>my whole life, in short, resolves itself into the sudden and
</p>
<p>terrible enlightenment which so early flashed upon me, and
</p>
<p>which communicated to all my energies an irresistible impulse.
</p>
<p>It might be objected that it would be more prudent, on
</p>
<p>my part, not to provoke, by the publication of this secret,
</p>
<p>irreconcilable hatred, and perhaps, even revenge. But
</p>
<p>have I not undergone the most painful sacrifices in order
</p>
<p>to keep myself free and independent? When the
</p>
<p>Almighty had released me from the only tie which bound
</p>
<p>me to my country, did I not quit it solely with a view to
</p>
<p>render public that which I had rigorously abstained from
</p>
<p>communicating even to my most intimate friends, from
</p>
<p>motives of prudence, and from well-founded fears ? And

</p>
<p>when I arrived in Switzerland, did I not pass for a vision-
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 63
</p>
<p>ary when I began to announce the plots which the Jesuits
</p>
<p>were ripening, and the dangers which were about to arise ?
</p>
<p>And now, perceiving, to my great surprise, that on one
</p>
<p>side a reaction is already taking place, and that, on the
</p>
<p>other, a certain class of interests, either from blindness or
</p>
<p>irreflection, is inclined to mix itself up with the interests of
</p>
<p>the Jesuits, little aware of the nature of the allies it seeks,
</p>
<p>or of the fate which attends all who make common cause
</p>
<p>with them, I feel more urgently than ever that this pub
</p>
<p>lication is incumbent on me.
</p>
<p>XXV.
</p>
<p>A phenomenon to which I am bound to call attention,
</p>
<p>because its immense importance is not sufficiently appre
</p>
<p>ciated, is the alliance, which is now more firm than ever,
</p>
<p>between the high clergy and Jesuitism. I say, that
</p>
<p>neither its extent, nor its consequences, are sufficiently
</p>
<p>apprehended. And yet, who will deny that it has been
</p>
<p>the character of Jesuitism from its origin to its suppres
</p>
<p>sion, as Clement XIV. attests, continually to foment in
</p>
<p>the bosom of universities, parliaments, clerical bodies, and
</p>
<p>religious corporations, a succession of discontents, divisions,
</p>
<p>quarrels, and discords ?
</p>
<p>The remarks contained in the following extracts from
</p>
<p>an anonymous pamphlet, published at Geneva, seem to me
</p>
<p>to have been called forth by the knowledge of a Secret
</p>
<p>Plan, already divulged in that place.
</p>
<p>"All around us," says the author of the pamphlet,

<p>" far and near, in Switzerland, in Germany, in England,
</p>
<p>64 SECRET PLAN
</p>
<p>and more particularly in France, Catholicism, which had
</p>
<p>for some time bowed its head beneath political storms and
</p>
<p>warlike operations, now rises up, more hostile, more
</p>
<p>threatening than ever, and boldly proclaims its design to
</p>
<p>extirpate from the bosom of Christianity what it calls the
</p>
<p>heresy of the Reformation.
</p>
<p>" In particular, an association founded by a cure of
</p>
<p>Paris, for the conversion of heretics, under the title of
</p>
<p>Congregation du Sacre Cosur de Marie, has obtained the
</p>
<p>sanction and concurrence of all the Romish clergy. Hum
</p>
<p>ble and obscure in its origin, it has risen, in an incredibly
</p>
<p>short space of time, to colossal proportions, its adherents
</p>
<p>now amounting to 2,000,000. These are disseminated
</p>
<p>through all the countries of the globe, and have taken a
</p>
<p>vow to co-operate in person and in purse in the propaga
</p>
<p>tion of Catholicism. They spare neither publications, nor '
</p>
<p>intrigues, nor money, nor even miracles, in order to gain
</p>
<p>their end. The gazette of the Simplon informs us, that
</p>
<p>the contributions of the two cantons of Valais and Soleure
</p>
<p>alone, have amounted this year (1842) to nearly 900,000
</p>
<p>French francs. It is easy to imagine what might be done
</p>
<p>with such resources, could money create faith.
</p>
<p>" Geneva could not fail to be one of the most attractive
</p>
<p>points to the Congregation, and in this place, in fact, it
</p>
<p>numbers many active associates. The rapidity with which
</p>
<p>the Catholic population daily increases within our walls,
</p>
<p>is, without any doubt, the fruit of this association, and
</p>
<p>already the foreign press proclaims this triumph.
</p>
<p>"A wind," continues the same pamphlet, "has blown
</p>
<p>from Rome, even over those writers who have hitherto

<p>remained most indifferent to religious interests ; it is impos-'

</p>
<p>sible not to recognise, in the malevolent absurdity of those
</p>
<p>attacks, which are renewed again and again, and almost
</p>
<p>word for word, the result of a vast concert, in which
</p>
<p>the hired performers obey, without perhaps being
</p>
<p>aware of it, the powerful and concealed instrument
</p>
<p>which gives them the key, from behind the curtain of
</p>
<p>the Alps."
</p>
<p>It is, then, an acknowledged fact that there exists a vast
</p>
<p>concert, in which the paid performers obey, almost un
</p>
<p>consciously, the powerful and hidden instrument which
</p>
<p>gives them the key, from behind the curtain of the Alps ;
</p>
<p>and it is even admitted that the many attacks we witness,
</p>
<p>far from being the effect of chance, are, on the contrary,
</p>
<p>evidently made with a view to certain remote projects.
</p>
<p>But who is there that cares to investigate the nature of
</p>
<p>these remote projects, and the means which may be em
</p>
<p>ployed to realize them ?
</p>
<p>All however agree in attributing to the Jesuits an
</p>
<p>extraordinary political influence. It is generally admitted
</p>
<p>that boundless power, absolute supremacy, is the object of
</p>
<p>their ambition. Their rule of action, that " the end jus
</p>
<p>tifies the means," is become proverbial. And who doubts
</p>
<p>that the end so sought is evermore this same boundless
</p>
<p>power and supremacy ?
</p>
<p>The progress of this order being known and acknow
</p>
<p>ledged, it would be folly not to suppose that it has abun
</p>
<p>dantly provided itself with baits of every description, in
</p>
<p>order to secure such an immense number of co-operators
</p>
<p>of all classes and parties, even those the most opposite by
</p>
<p>nature. And yet, no one has ever come forward with a view to

<p>investigate the means which the Jesuits are so industriously
</p>
<p>employing for the accomplishment of their ends. It is
</p>
<p>however easy to understand that the vast and formidable
</p>
<p>association, described in the above extract, is destined to
</p>
<p>be employed as a powerful lever, and to be directed, as
</p>
<p>time shall serve, to different points.
</p>
<p>If this Congregation du Sacre Cosur did not ultimately
</p>
<p>connect itself with the plan about to be exposed, we
</p>
<p>might have refrained from here quoting a fragment of
</p>
<p>its regulations, published in several journals. But the
</p>
<p>Siecle, after having examined not only the bases upon
</p>
<p>which it stands, but also its tendencies, thus accurately
</p>
<p>defines it : 
</p>
<p>" An occult government, organized in a hierarchical
</p>
<p>manner, to the furtherance of a political and religious
</p>
<p>reaction." It was impossible that the regulations of this new
</p>
<p>corporation should long remain a secret ; once discovered,
</p>
<p>they were soon published. The following are among the
</p>
<p>articles :

</p>
<p>whatsoever, the existence, the means, or the rules of the

<p>association." *
</p>
<p>" As the association has absolute need of pecuniary
</p>
<p>resources, in order to pursue its end, and fulfil its object,
</p>
<p>one of its fundamental rules is the existence of an annual

<p>See how the editor of the Univers, a paper known to

</p>
<p>he addresses to the Minister of Public Instruction :

<p>" This year, sir, you shall have no vacation ; nor shall

<p>OF THE JESUITS. 69
</p>
<p>Jesuits have inundated us. Such a course of reading
</p>
<p>could not fail to convince every candid mind that there
</p>
<p>really exists a secret understanding to propagate, in a
</p>
<p>devout and pathetic tone, the most unworthy falsehoods.
</p>
<p>In fact, the religious orders would have us believe that,
</p>
<p>setting aside a few weaknesses incidental to human nature,
</p>
<p>their mission has ever been one of pure beneficence. All
</p>
<p>the calumnies which have been directed against them
</p>
<p>have sprung from heresy and impiety, actuated by jealousy
</p>
<p>and rancour. Consequently, if nations would seek to emerge
</p>
<p>from the factions and troubles which agitate them, they
</p>
<p>must repent of their ingratitude and return to their ancient
</p>
<p>saviours; "for," say they, "as long as the disastrous
</p>
<p>principle of free inquiry was unknown, and men suffered
</p>
<p>themselves to be guided by the principle of authority,
</p>
<p>all was harmony and peace ; but once the principle of
</p>
<p>infallible authority was assailed, the whole world became
</p>
<p>the theatre of all sorts of evils and disorders.'' What
</p>
<p>incredible efforts have they not made to prop up this
</p>
<p>gigantic falsehood !
</p>
<p>Even a cursory inquiry into these manoeuvres and
</p>
<p>artifices, can hardly fail to manifest that the prime mover
</p>
<p>of all this wonderfully assiduous labour is a power which
</p>
<p>works in secret, which combines all the subordinate move
</p>
<p>ments, which chooses and applies its means according
</p>
<p>to circumstances; and which spares neither flattery nor
</p>
<p>bribes in order to enrol in its service those individuals,
</p>
<p>whether writers or men of action, who may be able to aid
</p>
<p>the work.
</p>

<p>thus rending the veil which has been so carefully drawn to
</p>
<p>70 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>conceal projects, the extent of which, I verily believe, is un
</p>
<p>known to the mass of the Jesuits, as well as to the bishops,
</p>
<p>the cardinals, and the pope himself. But, God is my wit
</p>
<p>ness that the motive which animates and sustains me is
</p>
<p>the desire to prevent a mistake fostered and propagated
</p>
<p>by the most Machiavelian policy, and which would entail
</p>
<p>the direst calamities on human society.
</p>
<p>I submit to men of cultivated understanding, who can
</p>
<p>reason and judge impartially, the secret conversations I am
</p>
<p>about to relate. Especially do I refer the matter to those
</p>
<p>who have studied not only the art by which the Roman
</p>
<p>theocracy has raised itself to so high a degree of power, but
</p>
<p>also the writings, the tactics, the acts and achievements of
</p>
<p>that order, which has, since its establishment, been the
</p>
<p>most subservient to its despotism. If my readers keep
</p>
<p>themselves free from the influence of a preconceived system,
</p>
<p>and from the prejudices of their position, whatever it
</p>
<p>may be, I doubt not that they will discern, on a cool
</p>
<p>examination of the whole plan, that it is redolent
</p>
<p>throughout of the most subtle and profound spirit of
</p>
<p>Jesuitism. I can, indeed, have no dearth of materials to dissipate
</p>
<p>all uncertainty, and these I owe to the ardour of investiga
</p>
<p>tion of which I have already spoken, and which was con
</p>
<p>stantly inciting me to investigate every incident which had
</p>
<p>the slightest bearing upon Jesuitism. But what has most
</p>
<p>astonished me has been this : to find in books and journals,
</p>
<p>the organs of conflicting opinions, not only isolated ideas,
</p>
<p>but series of ideas, closely identified, both as to style and
</p>
<p>subject, with those of the meeting, as it is about to be

<p>described ; and this identity is so striking, that I ask myself :
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 71
</p>
<p>Must not these books and articles be the work of individuals
</p>
<p>belonging to the knot of the initiated, or, at least, to the
</p>
<p>league ? If it has not been in my power to collect a suffi
</p>
<p>cient number of facts to give to the Secret Plan which I am
</p>
<p>publishing an irresistible character of authenticity  for,
</p>
<p>after all, every one knows that conspiracies of this nature,
</p>
<p>being destined to remain a mystery, never transpire but by
</p>
<p>some remarkable chance ;  yet, in the impossibility of ful
</p>
<p>filling conditions which are, in fact, inadmissible, I cannot
</p>
<p>suffer to escape me the only kind of proofs which, in such a
</p>
<p>case, it is reasonably permitted to require.
</p>
<p>These proofs will, then, be brought forward in the latter
</p>
<p>part of this work, and those readers who will take the pains
</p>
<p>to examine them will know how to place a just value on the
</p>
<p>language which the Jesuits and their official apologists have
</p>
<p>borrowed from the true advocates of progress  a language
</p>
<p>which they are now employing with singular audacity. It
</p>
<p>will be proved by irrefutable arguments that civil and
</p>
<p>political equality, freedom of worship, of education, and of
</p>
<p>association, are in their hands weapons of war, and nothing
</p>
<p>more.
</p>
<p>XXVII.
</p>
<p>It was at the time of restorations of all sorts that
</p>
<p>Jesuitism also was restored. At the period when the Holy
</p>
<p>Alliance was formed, the pope determined that he also would
</p>
<p>create a rampart for himself, against the encroachment of
</p>
<p>new ideas ; he therefore evoked, from the depths of its

<p>mysterious retreats, the most skilful and enterprising of
</p>
<p>72 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>orders, that he might by its aid unite and consolidate not
</p>
<p>only all the orders, but the clergy of different countries,
</p>
<p>and the episcopacy, in a Theocratical Holy Alliance, of
</p>
<p>which the object would be not less fatal to the people than
</p>
<p>to the governing powers themselves.
</p>
<p>" Pius VII.," as M. Henrion remarks, " at length
</p>
<p>recovering his liberty in 1814, recalled the religious orders
</p>
<p>to more active life. They have, subsequently, sent out new
</p>
<p>ramifications into many countries, and the venerable tree,
</p>
<p>which had been cut down nearly to the ground, shoots forth
</p>
<p>new branches, and is already adorned with abundance of
</p>
<p>foliage, which gladdens the eyes of Christians. In France,
</p>
<p>the change which took place in our political system in the
</p>
<p>month of August, 1 830, having consecrated, in an especial
</p>
<p>manner, the liberty of association, there is no doubt that the
</p>
<p>monastic state will speedily rise up from its ruins."*
</p>
<p>There will be no stability, according to the same writer,
</p>
<p>there will be no repose for society, if it refuses anew to be
</p>
<p>directed by monastic institutions. These would naturally
</p>
<p>range themselves under the leadership of Jesuitism. How
</p>
<p>should it be otherwise ? Does not this order hold in its
</p>
<p>hands the plan of battle ? Does it not train the combatants ?
</p>
<p>Does it not direct them to the point to be attained ? Why,
</p>
<p>otherwise, has the education of your youth been confided to
</p>
<p>the Jesuits ? Why have they alone been judged worthy to
</p>
<p>initiate the clergy in the art of confession ?
</p>
<p>"It is impossible," continues their apologist, "that the
</p>
<p>Company should not know how to take its stand, and to
</p>
<p>adapt itself to the exigencies of the present state of things,

</p>
<p>that it should not know how, as formerly, to become popular
</p>
<p>by answering to the true wants of the period."
</p>
<p>The Jesuits make one promise which is very singular,
</p>
<p>that of " acting only in the face of day, lest suspicious and
</p>
<p>impious men should mistake for intrigue the pious subterfuges
</p>
<p>and the sublime secrets of humility." What, indeed, could
</p>
<p>be more excellent than the work which they propose to
</p>
<p>accomplish 1 To extirpate the genius of evil ! to lay the
</p>
<p>foundations of Christian civilization ! But this is only to
</p>
<p>be done on condition that the people deliver themselves,
</p>
<p>bound hand and foot, to the Company of Jesus.
</p>
<p>We find in the same author the following reflec
</p>
<p>tions : 
</p>
<p>" In the moral world evil never walks abroad without its
</p>
<p>attendant good ; and it is very favourable for the Jesuits
</p>
<p>that they should have been restored in 1814, at a period
</p>
<p>when the people, delivered from a long-standing European
</p>
<p>war, remained a prey to principles equally false in religion
</p>
<p>and politics. The crisis came ; and it could be nothing
</p>
<p>short of divine inspiration which suggested to Pius VII.
</p>
<p>the thought of rallying around the apostolic throne a
</p>
<p>society so formed to trample down error.
</p>
<p>" It was not, however, until 1823" (a date to which I call
</p>
<p>particular attention) " that the Roman College, which had
</p>
<p>passed into other hands since the fall of the Jesuits, was
</p>
<p>restored to them by Pope Leo XII. Several towns in Italy,
</p>
<p>the Duke of Modena, the King of Sardinia, and Freiburg
</p>
<p>in Switzerland, also welcomed the members of this reviving
</p>
<p>company. The King of Spain restored to them all their
</p>
<p>property, houses, and colleges, which had not been sold.

<p>In France they opened establishments for public instruction

<p>74 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>at St. Acheul, Dole, Bordeaux, &c, &c. Francis II.
</p>
<p>received them in Gallicia, where they devoted themselves
</p>
<p>to instruction in the colleges of Tarnopol, Starzawiz, and
</p>
<p>Janow, and to active missions elsewhere. The company
</p>
<p>possesses colleges in England also, and in the United
</p>
<p>States of America."
</p>
<p>M. Henrion, the friend and confidant of the Jesuits,
</p>
<p>doubtless knows, as well as any one, what is the end which
</p>
<p>they propose to themselves ; and in one single line he thus
</p>
<p>betrays it :  " It is," says he, " the annihilation of a double
</p>
<p>class of principles to which the people are a prey  principles
</p>
<p>equally false in religion and in politics."
</p>
<p>They would then destroy all the ideas which the French
</p>
<p>revolution has bequeathed to the world ; in other words,
</p>
<p>they would abolish free inquiry, in order to bind every
</p>
<p>conscience with the chains of Catholic authority ; they
</p>
<p>would strike down the principle of liberty, the source of
</p>
<p>all justice, in order to build up again the tyranny of times
</p>
<p>gone by.

<p>XXVIII.
</p>
<p>I deem it important here to bring forward a fragment
</p>
<p>of the text, too little known, of the bull by which Pius VII.
</p>
<p>restored the Jesuits in 1814. This pope, whose spirit,
</p>
<p>happily for humanity, the accession of Pius IX. has
</p>
<p>banished from the Vatican, declared that the Jesuits were
</p>
<p>indispensable to the safety of the world and to the well-

<p>being of the nations, and that he considered he should be
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 75
</p>
<p>neglecting one of his most urgent duties if he suffered the
</p>
<p>church to be longer deprived of their aid. He goes even
</p>
<p>further, and declares that they alone are competent to
</p>
<p>direct the faithful, the inferior clergy, and the bishops
</p>
<p>themselves. In short, he constitutes and consecrates them
</p>
<p>as the indispensable rowers of the mysterious Bark, the
</p>
<p>title by which the popes are accustomed to designate the
</p>
<p>Catholic church.
</p>
<p>And lastly, in order that nothing may be wanting to
</p>
<p>an apotheosis so extraordinary, Pius VII. proclaims, in the
</p>
<p>face of nations, that under their guidance the bark of
</p>
<p>Catholicism will assuredly be saved, whilst without their
</p>
<p>care and protection it must inevitably founder.
</p>
<p>Had we not then abundant reason to affirm that every
</p>
<p>thing contained in these avowals is of immense importance,
</p>
<p>and calls for the closest attention ?
</p>
<p>And yet, so far from having allowed myself to exagge
</p>
<p>rate, I have closely paraphrased the following words,
</p>
<p>extracted from the bull of Pius VII., Sollicitudo omnium
</p>
<p>ecclesiarum: 
</p>
<p>" We should believe ourselves guilty," it is there stated,
</p>
<p>" of a very heavy offence before God, if, amidst the many
</p>
<p>pressing wants under which the public weal is suffering, we
</p>
<p>neglected to bring forward for its use the salutary help
</p>
<p>which God, by a singular providence, has placed in our
</p>
<p>hands." And whom has he selected to bring to the public weal
</p>
<p>this salutary help ?
</p>
<p>The Jesuits !

<p>"On account," adds this same pope, "of the waves

</p>
<p>himself as highly culpable, if he rejected the robust and
</p>
<p>experienced rowers who offer themselves to him to quell
</p>
<p>the force of these ever-threatening waves."
</p>
<p>And the simple and significant reason which he gives

<p>is this : 
</p>
<p>"That it may not be swallowed up in inevitable

<p>END OF PART I.
</p>
<p>PAET II.
</p>
<p>THE SECRET CONFERENCE.
</p>
<p>It will be as well, before giving the account of the Secret
</p>
<p>Conference, to make some observations which may tend, as
</p>
<p>far as possible, to compensate to the reader for the want of
</p>
<p>what the tone and manner of the living voices have left for
</p>
<p>ever present to my memory.
</p>
<p>I will first remark, that the list mentioned by the chief,
</p>
<p>and in which were set down the special points to be dis
</p>
<p>cussed, proves that everything in these meetings was
</p>
<p>arranged in the most precise manner.
</p>
<p>If the reader carefully considers each discourse, he will
</p>
<p>perceive that each person has his own peculiar and dis
</p>
<p>tinctive style. The voices of the several speakers served
</p>
<p>me, instead of their faces, to know them one from the
</p>
<p>other ; each one had peculiarities which I have not forgotten.
</p>
<p>One of the fathers, the second who spoke, and whom I
</p>
<p>heard no more afterwards, surprised me by a most singular
</p>
<p>pronunciation. I had never heard a voice so slow and
</p>
<p>smooth, and oily. At the same time, no other speaker
</p>
<p>was more prolix and diffuse, yet he was listened to with
</p>
<p>the greatest attention. He was almost the only one who
</p>
<p>occupied himself exclusively with the people, showing by

</p>
<p>what baits it may be taken. Between this phlegmatic
</p>
<p>orator and all the others the contrast was striking ; it was
</p>
<p>only at rare intervals that he became a little excited. At
</p>
<p>last, however, when he communicated a dialogue of one of
</p>
<p>his penitents with a companion, entirely to the honour of
</p>
<p>the Jesuits, he expressed himself with such unexpected
</p>
<p>animation as elicited a burst of merriment and great
</p>
<p>applause. Another, whom I call the Irishman, is remarkable
</p>
<p>for a caustic and impetuous wit; he seemed possessed
</p>
<p>with fever. The Roman Jesuit is less vehement, but blunt
</p>
<p>and plain spoken ; sometimes in a degree amounting to
</p>
<p>coarseness. The two Frenchmen exhibit a quite different
</p>
<p>character ; one of them makes himself especially known by
</p>
<p>the ideas which he attacks with most eagerness, by the
</p>
<p>reminiscences his allusions awaken, and by his inva
</p>
<p>riably clear and precise manner of expressing himself.
</p>
<p>The rector of the novitiate distinguished himself by a
</p>
<p>certain factitious pomp and gravity pervading all he said.
</p>
<p>He seemed made on purpose to ape wisdom, and make
</p>
<p>an exhibition of it. Father Roothaan had no occasion to be
</p>
<p>curbed from time to time, as happened, I thought, now
</p>
<p>and then to the Irishman ; there was no fire, no acrimony,
</p>
<p>in the terms he employed ; he expressed himself with
</p>
<p>gentleness, though occasionally with warmth ; it must be
</p>
<p>confessed, however, that under his unctuous accents he
</p>
<p>conceals a propensity to violence and persecution.
</p>
<p>There was one anomaly which I know not how to
</p>
<p>account for. The individual, whom I suppose to have
</p>
<p>been the general at that time (the same of whom I have

<p>OF THE JESUITS. 79
</p>
<p>sation), opened the meeting with an address in very pure
</p>
<p>and eloquent terms, which my memory is far from having
</p>
<p>faithfully rendered ;* yet when all were seated and silently
</p>
<p>attentive round him, all his expressions seemed heavy,
</p>
<p>turgid, and inflated. There was something false and
</p>
<p>embarrassed in his voice. Subsequently, however, he re
</p>
<p>sumed all the promptitude and facility which he had at
</p>
<p>first displayed.
</p>
<p>Though the persons present at the conference were
</p>
<p>few, they are about to appear before the reader presenting
</p>
<p>temperaments and characters essentially different ; some
</p>
<p>impetuous, some calm, others constantly grave. And yet
</p>
<p>the kind of work which was to be common to them all,
</p>
<p>far from tending to place these different characters in pro
</p>
<p>minent relief, was rather calculated to merge all their
</p>
<p>individual characteristics, and reduce them to one standard
</p>
<p>type. In fact, it is only in assemblies, where there exists
</p>
<p>an opposition of principles and interests, which gives rise
</p>
<p>to free and contradictory debates, that each one, drawn
</p>
<p>out by circumstances, shows himself under his own pecu
</p>
<p>liar features. Here, nevertheless, notwithstanding the
</p>
<p>unanimity of the meeting, the genius of each appears
</p>
<p>sufficiently striking to be easily distinguished.
</p>
<p>None but those who have seriously studied Jesuitism,
</p>
<p>in the past as well as the present, and who know its spirit
</p>
<p>and audacity, will be able fully to understand all the mean
</p>
<p>ing conveyed in the least of their words, without being
</p>
<p>astonished at the pride which devours them, or at the

<p>schemes which they meditate. Yet I believe it would

<p>require more than that to be able to apprehend the whole
</p>
<p>scope of their desires. It would be necessary not only to
</p>
<p>be acquainted with all their rules and their secret statutes,
</p>
<p>but with all the former discussions which led them to
</p>
<p>resume the weaving of that web of which I am about to
</p>
<p>show a few threads, and which, at the present day, must
</p>
<p>have extended immensely. It would be necessary likewise
</p>
<p>to consider the education these fathers had received, the
</p>
<p>preparatory influence to which they had been submitted,
</p>
<p>as well as the degrees through which they must have past
</p>
<p>before they could be judged worthy of becoming members
</p>
<p>of this committee which may be regarded as the last term
</p>
<p>of initiation. In fine, they were all under the empire of
</p>
<p>principles and ideas which had been discussed in the three
</p>
<p>preceding sittings, or in confidential conversations. All they
</p>
<p>did was necessarily connected with these antecedents ; con
</p>
<p>sequently, being ignorant of the latter, it is very possible we
</p>
<p>may mistake certain passages, or comprehend them but
</p>
<p>superficially. Let us enter at last upon the conference. When all
</p>
<p>were seated, and silence established, the president began to
</p>
<p>speak as follows : 
</p>
<p>I.
</p>
<p>" Dear brethren, our weapons are of a quite different
</p>
<p>temper from those of the Caesars of all ages ; and it will

<p>not be difficult for us so to manoeuvre as to render our

<p>selves masters of all the powers already so much weakened.

<p>We need fear no lack of soldiers, only let us apply ourselves
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 81
</p>
<p>to recruiting them from all ranks, and from all nations, and
</p>
<p>drilling them into punctual service. But let us, at the same
</p>
<p>time, be vigilant, that no one suspect our designs. Let
</p>
<p>every one be persuaded, whilst consecrating to us his
</p>
<p>labour, his gold, or his talents, that he is employing them
</p>
<p>in his own interest.
</p>
<p>Ours be the knowledge of this great mystery: as to
</p>
<p>others, let them hear us speak in parables, so that, having
</p>
<p>eyes, they may not see, and having ears, they may not hear.
</p>
<p>Let us labour more diligently than all who have un
</p>
<p>dertaken to raise great hierarchical edifices, and let our
</p>
<p>labour be in earnest !
</p>
<p>You well know that what we aim at is the empire of
</p>
<p>the world ; but how are we to succeed, unless we have,
</p>
<p>everywhere, adepts who understand our language, which
</p>
<p>must yet remain unknown to others.
</p>
<p>Doubtless, you have not forgotten our ancient Para
</p>
<p>guay. It was but a very limited trial of our system, in a
</p>
<p>small corner of the globe. In these latter days, we need a
</p>
<p>new code, we who have undertaken to work so mighty a
</p>
<p>change  to make everything bend beneath the irresistible
</p>
<p>hammer of our doctrines, so that all shall become as stone,
</p>
<p>iron, gold, and adamant, for the gigantic building into
</p>
<p>which we will force all men to enter.
</p>
<p>Let every individual, therefore, yield up an entire
</p>
<p>obedience. Let him plight inviolable vows in one sole
</p>
<p>convent ; and let the pope  but a pope of our own forming
</p>
<p> be its perpetual abbot !
</p>

<p>II.
</p>
<p>The president having ceased, the father with the soft and drawling
</p>
<p>voice began to speak:  *
</p>
<p>Yes ; let us incessantly and unweariedly propagate our

<p>doctrines amongst the people; warmed by the fire of these
</p>
<p>doctrines, they will become changed for us into thunderbolts
</p>
<p>to strike down these haughty kings, who, instead of in
</p>
<p>clining their heads before the church as submissive sons, do
</p>
<p>her the favour to accept her as a satellite, who is good for
</p>
<p>nothing but to save them from almost inevitable ruin.
</p>
<p>To this people, discontented and born to suffer, let
</p>
<p>us incessantly repeat : 
</p>
<p> Here follows in the original the obscure and embarrassed com

<p>mencement of this father's discourse. " Sopra le populazioni, sopra,

</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 83
</p>
<p>" You are wretched, deeply wretched, we know it but
</p>
<p>too well ; and who can deplore your lot more sincerely than
</p>
<p>we do? Do we not know that you earn your bread by the
</p>
<p>sweat of your brows ; but the greatest of all your evils is
</p>
<p>that you are ignorant of their true source. Oh, did you
</p>
<p>but know this, a great step would be already made towards
</p>
<p>delivering you from the only enemy who has plunged you
</p>
<p>into this vast abyss of misery. Know then, that all your
</p>
<p>wretchedness dates from the execrable day on which a
</p>
<p>renegade monk, in order to indulge his vile passions, dared
</p>
<p> oh, horror!  to unite himself with a nun whom he
</p>
<p>snatched from her convent.
</p>
<p>" Ever since that time, the Almighty has not ceased to
</p>
<p>roll the waves of his vengeance over the earth ; peace has
</p>
<p>taken flight ; the Holy Father has, with grief and indigna
</p>
<p>tion, beheld his children desert the sacred portals, and
</p>
<p>heard them insolently exclaim, ' We break thy bonds, we
</p>
<p>contemn thy precepts; thou art no longer our master.'
</p>
<p>Cursed and excommunicated, they have since wandered in
</p>
<p>barren and dark places^ In vain the vicar of Jesus Christ
</p>
<p>has striven to recal these miserable prodigals ; delivered
</p>
<p>up to their errors and their wilfulness, they have despised
</p>
<p>his offers of pardon.
</p>
<p>" Behold the portrait of these rebels who have rejected
</p>
<p>him whom God put into his own place to govern all things.
</p>
<p>Listen to this psalm : God asks, ' Why do the heathen rage,
</p>
<p>and the people imagine a vain thing?' And thus God
</p>
<p>answers himself: ' The kings of the earth set themselves, and
</p>
<p>the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and
</p>
<p>against His anointed, saying, Let us break their bonds

</p>
<p>84 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>in the heavens shall laugh : the Lord shall have them in
</p>
<p>derision.' " If then the justice of God visits the earth with so
</p>
<p>many chastisements, it is that he may punish its ancient
</p>
<p>revolt. Wonder not, if to avenge himself on these apostates,
</p>
<p>and on the kings who have sustained them, he excites
</p>
<p>against them all the rage of their subjects : for you are not
</p>
<p>ignorant that during the space of three hundred years a
</p>
<p>frightful monster, the revolutionary hydra, has been un
</p>
<p>chained, and ceases not to threaten to devour them.
</p>
<p>" O golden age of the church ! O surprising miracle !
</p>
<p>who would believe it, were it not as true as it is sublime 1
</p>
<p>When nothing could tame the pride of those sovereigns
</p>
<p>who crushed the poor and the weak, so strongly recom
</p>
<p>mended by Jesus Christ to his vicar, he, a simple old man,
</p>
<p>extinguished with a word all this pride, as a light may be
</p>
<p>extinguished with one impulse of the breath. In those
</p>
<p>days the spouse of Jesus Christ was without spot or
</p>
<p>wrinkle. She shone as the springtide sun, which warms and
</p>
<p>makes the earth fruitful. It was not until after the days
</p>
<p>of the pretended Reformation that our holy mother beheld
</p>
<p>her children suffering from indigence and from hunger, and
</p>
<p>that she deplored her inability to help them. Alas ! it is
</p>
<p>but too true that this plague was no sooner spread over
</p>
<p>the earth, than all justice, all charity, and every good
</p>
<p>thing grew less and less, in proportion as the respect for
</p>
<p>the vicar of Jesus Christ diminished. It was not thus in
</p>
<p>the days of the church's prosperity, when her fathers, her
</p>
<p>learned doctors (compared with whom the most distin
</p>
<p>guished men of the present day are but as worms), were

<p>always careful to recommend an obedience without bounds
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 85
</p>
<p>towards the common father of the faithful, the successor of
</p>
<p>Saint Peter ; and never did they pronounce his name with
</p>
<p>out bending the knee. Saint Bernard, although the pope
</p>
<p>had been his disciple, never wrote to him without having
</p>
<p>first prostrated himself on the earth.
</p>
<p>" Do you, let me ask you, show this respect each time
</p>
<p>that you speak of the vicar of Jesus Christ ? No ; it is
</p>
<p>but too plain, it is but too true, that the best amongst you
</p>
<p>have lost your reverence for holy things. Ah ! if God
</p>
<p>granted you the grace to comprehend what it is to occupy,
</p>
<p>on the earth, the place of God himself, with what fire
</p>
<p>would you not feel yourselves inflamed ; what would you
</p>
<p>not attempt and brave, in order to free your sole benefactor
</p>
<p>from the yoke of the impious ! Without doubt, the Al
</p>
<p>mighty could immediately effect this himself ; but it is his
</p>
<p>will that your own right arms should deliver you from
</p>
<p>your enemies by a heroic victory ; since the glorious good
</p>
<p>which will result from it will form the recompense of the
</p>
<p>poor and the oppressed, and of all those who groan in
</p>
<p>subjection. Do you not remember with what constancy
</p>
<p>the faithful Israelites resisted the perfidious Canaanites ?
</p>
<p>Courage, my children ! for you also have to take possession of
</p>
<p>a promised land, which will pour forth for you every species
</p>
<p>of delights to refresh your wearied souls ! Awake !
</p>
<p>arise ! unite yourselves in a fraternal bond, which will
</p>
<p>strengthen you against every obstacle, if you wish, indeed,
</p>
<p>that the future should be yours. Have you ever reflected
</p>
<p>that if the heavens are become bronze, as it were, above
</p>
<p>your heads, God has permitted it, to punish your guilty
</p>
<p>negligence. Madmen and fools that ye are ! you allow

<p>that His Holiness, he who represents God upon earth, should

<p>86 SECRET PLAN
</p>
<p>be held in slavery ! But the finger of your heavenly Father
</p>
<p>has written the decree, that your own degraded lot shall be
</p>
<p>lengthened out as long as the degradation of your terrestrial
</p>
<p>father shall endure, he at whose feet every one who
</p>
<p>hopes for salvation ought to cast himself. In vain, be
</p>
<p>assured, does the pope seek to bless you  in vain does he
</p>
<p>raise his voice to do you justice ; he is surrounded, like
</p>
<p>Christ himself, by scoffers and hardened sinners, who reject
</p>
<p>his word. " Nevertheless, all these erring sinners are your breth
</p>
<p>ren ; you are not to hate them in your hearts  by no
</p>
<p>means ; but it is the will of God that you should employ
</p>
<p>every means to induce them to accept of pardon, to recall
</p>
<p>them to the fold, where, when they have once entered it,
</p>
<p>the very wolves are transformed into sheep.
</p>
<p>" Listen, listen ! we will give you spiritual eyes.
</p>
<p>" Where are the princes, even amongst those of our
</p>
<p>religion, who have dared, and who still dare, to concern
</p>
<p>themselves with the things of God ?
</p>
<p>" Behold wherefore the impious one has invaded the
</p>
<p>church ; behold wherefore she, chained and enslaved, can
</p>
<p>neither speak nor claim obedience. The Anointed of the
</p>
<p>Lord, and the other anointed ones, his ministers, are every

<p>where treated without respect, and denied all authority.
</p>
<p>Their privileges are suppressed, their rightful property is
</p>
<p>torn from them, their honour is eclipsed, their character
</p>
<p>calumniated, and they are almost virtually annihilated.
</p>
<p>" The prophecy is thus nearly accomplished. We have

<p>already long beheld the man of sin, the son of perdition

<p>Antichrist, in a word  set up above him whom every one

</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 87
</p>
<p>desires, by his pride, by his persecution of the clergy, and
</p>
<p>by his insatiable ambition, robbing that which belongs to
</p>
<p>God, and trampling under foot all that is sacred and divine 
</p>
<p>he clearly shows that he sits in the temple of God, and that
</p>
<p>he would even be regarded as God himself.
</p>
<p>" Happy the time when this crowned dragon was
</p>
<p>muzzled by the church, when strength was wanting for
</p>
<p>him to accomplish his sacrilegious ravages ; but at length,
</p>
<p>alas ! he has succeeded in possessing all the earth, by the
</p>
<p>aid of a troop of apostates, and by the prodigies of his
</p>
<p>infamous seductions. Behold the source of all your ills.
</p>
<p>It is from this revolt against the church that so many
</p>
<p>amongst you are unable to contract a marriage without
</p>
<p>exposing himself to a thousand vexations. Thus is verified,
</p>
<p>not only that text which foretells that Antichrist would
</p>
<p>forbid to marry, but that other which says that the faithful
</p>
<p>would be compelled to abstain from a variety of delicate
</p>
<p>meats, which God has created for all, and not for the enjoy
</p>
<p>ment of an exclusive few.
</p>
<p>" O sublime institution of Jesus Christ ! O confession!
</p>
<p>source of such infinite good ! It is by thee that our ears
</p>
<p>become acquainted with the miseries of those whose lot
</p>
<p>is ceaseless toil, and of their many unnatural and unjust
</p>
<p>privations. Hence it is that confession, which lightens
</p>
<p>for you the weight of so many griefs, becomes hateful
</p>
<p>to your oppressors. They would deprive you of it, because
</p>
<p>it is your solace and your refuge. By means of con

<p>88 SECRET PLAN
</p>
<p>which you could not elsewhere reveal without a thousand

<p>dangers !
</p>
<p>" Poor friends ! if you would only abide by our instruc

<p>tions, ifyou would consent to place yourselves, with one accord,
</p>
<p>as instruments in our hands, you would no longer have to

<p>toil for the productions of the earth, in order that others may

<p>enjoy them to your exclusion.

<p>" But do you truly desire to erect your heads towards
</p>
<p>heaven ? If you do indeed desire it, begin by enforcing
</p>
<p>respect for him without whom the poor will never be
</p>
<p>respected." This is the language I employ with them ; and after
</p>
<p>having thus indoctrinated my conscripts, I give them a
</p>
<p>history of the Crusades, rousing them by the picture of
</p>
<p>this great movement of many nations ; and in order to
</p>
<p>bind them to our league, I say to them : 
</p>
<p>" What an impulse, my brethren ! What sacrifices !
</p>
<p>what martyrdoms ! And yet there was not one of these

<p>soldiers of Christ who looked for any temporal advantage to

<p>himself. They had but one desire  to redeem from Turkish

<p>hands a simple stone, an empty sepulchre, and to breathe

<p>their last sigh on holy ground.

<p>ceive that there is now something worse than Turkish

<p>OF THE JESUITS. 89
</p>
<p>"A psalm which you often sing thus speaks to the
</p>
<p>blessed who fight for the Eternal, and destroy his enemies,
</p>
<p>root and branch: 'Be of good cheer, and singing holy
</p>
<p>songs, arm yourself with the two-edged sword, to exercise
</p>
<p>vengeance upon the heretic nations, to chastise the un
</p>
<p>believers, to fetter their kings and their nobles, to execute
</p>
<p>against them the judgment which is written ; for such is the
</p>
<p>glory reserved for all the saints,' that is to say, for all good
</p>
<p>Catholics. " O may these sacred sparks kindle at the bottom of
</p>
<p>your hearts ! Cherish them for the great day which is,
</p>
<p>perhaps, near at hand; propagate them in the minds of
</p>
<p>your children, of your husbands, of your wives ; and, finally,
</p>
<p>be assured that the day of triumph for the holy cause of
</p>
<p>God' will be that in which, all your tears wiped away, you
</p>
<p>will make the very heavens resound with your shouts of joy !"
</p>
<p>Such language as this never failed of its effect : aroused
</p>
<p>and excited by such words, the hearers almost always go
</p>
<p>forth burning with rage.
</p>
<p>I will repeat to you a conversation which I had once
</p>
<p>the satisfaction to overhear. A penitent of ours said to his
</p>
<p>comrade 
</p>
<p>" John, it is only the Jesuit fathers who are men ; all the
</p>
<p>others are stupid fools." "How so?" "Because it is
</p>
<p>only they who can see to the bottom of things." " What !
</p>
<p>do they understand our hardships, and can they find a cure
</p>
<p>for them ? " " Have I not often told you so ! Go and open
</p>
<p>your heart to them, tell them everything, listen to them,
</p>
<p>and you will learn certain things. I swear to you, you will
</p>
<p>soon know more than all these philosophers who make such

<p>an uproar." " What is it they tell you, then 1" " Go and

<p>will know why the world goes on so badly, and what we

<p>must do to set it to rights."
</p>
<p>III.
</p>
<p>It was this anecdote, related in a tone of pleasantry, contrasting
</p>
<p>strongly with that maintained during the other part of the discourse,
</p>
<p>which excited the hilarity and the applauses already mentioned. The
</p>
<p>next speaker I recognised by his voice as the rector.
</p>
<p>Still, it is upon the great that we ought particularly to
</p>
<p>exert our influence. We ought to bring them to believe
</p>
<p>that in a period stormy as this is there is no safety for them
</p>
<p>but through us. Let us never relax in our efforts to penetrate
</p>
<p>them with the idea that they can only hope to obtain any
</p>
<p>great results by subjecting to us the consciences of their sub
</p>
<p>ordinates, and those of the common people, so that we, or
</p>
<p>those, at least, who follow our counsels, may wholly direct
</p>
<p>them. If they are satisfied with the service it is in our
</p>
<p>power to render them, by the discovery of secrets which
</p>
<p>our peculiar position enables us alone to penetrate, then
</p>
<p>in return (for their own sakes be it clearly understood, and
</p>
<p>if they desire a time to arrive when there shall be no more
</p>
<p>revolts and revolutions to trouble them), let them not be
</p>
<p>sparing in such praises of us as are likely to make an impres
</p>
<p>sion on powerful members of the Protestant body, and to lead
</p>
<p>them to conclude that we alone possess the art of con
</p>
<p>solidating governments, since it is our mission to correct

<p>whatever remained imperfect and unfinished in the middle
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 91
</p>
<p>ages, in consequence of the fatal disputes between church
</p>
<p>and state.
</p>
<p>But since they may object certain acts of ours which are
</p>
<p>not free from a seditious appearance, we must do all in our
</p>
<p>power to colour and disguise these acts, so that they may not
</p>
<p>be too glaring. We must give them to understand that if we
</p>
<p>act thus it is because we are intimately persuaded that the
</p>
<p>cause of evil, the bad leaven, will remain in the world as
</p>
<p>long as Protestantism shall exist ; that Protestantism must
</p>
<p>therefore be utterly abolished, since inquiry in religious
</p>
<p>matters creates and propagates inquiry in other matters.
</p>
<p>The admirable order of things which (we must tell them)
</p>
<p>it is our object to establish, can only exist on condition that
</p>
<p>the people shall be forced to move round these two axes,
</p>
<p>monarchy and the church. We must prove to them that
</p>
<p>we alone, with the other orders, and the clergy (the clergy,
</p>
<p>be it understood, under certain conditions), are capable of
</p>
<p>being more effectually useful to them than all their armed
</p>
<p>forces. And why ? Because compression, far from chang
</p>
<p>ing the heart, only inflames it the more ; whereas the most
</p>
<p>violent and obstinate finish by yielding to religion, when
</p>
<p>she acts upon them with confession for her auxiliary, and
</p>
<p>ecclesiastical pomp for a bait.
</p>
<p>Let us moreover take all possible pains to convince them
</p>
<p>that they ought not to grudge the wealth possessed by the
</p>
<p>religious bodies, or that which we are constantly accumulat
</p>
<p>ing, for these riches are necessary to us; without them we
</p>
<p>could execute no great enterprise.

</p>
<p>each of your favours will in the end be restored to you a
</p>
<p>hundredfold." But what we must, above all things, endeavour to make
</p>
<p>apparent to them is this, that the ancient struggles between
</p>
<p>the church and the state are no longer possible, these two
</p>
<p>powers having learnt that there is nothing to be gained by
</p>
<p>transgressing their respective limits. From whence it
</p>
<p>follows that governments, protected by the wonderful pro
</p>
<p>gress of diplomacy, will be for ever secure from all abuse
</p>
<p>of anathema, and all attempts at usurpation, and may, with
</p>
<p>all confidence, leave to the priesthood the entire direction of
</p>
<p>the faithful. Besides, let governments learn that all our
</p>
<p>sacraments, confraternities, ceremonies, little books,
</p>
<p>&c, &c, are infinitely less to be feared than these
</p>
<p>pestilent journals of all sorts, which are good for nothing
</p>
<p>but to excite the worst passions ; that it is infinitely more
</p>
<p>safe for the multitude to sink back into the legends of the
</p>
<p>middle ages, which will chain down their imaginations to the
</p>
<p>worship of past times ; whilst, on the contrary, if we once
</p>

<p>The style of thought and imagery, and the accent of the next speaker,
</p>
<p>evidently denoted that he was from Great Britain. I shall call him
</p>
<p>the Irishman. In my opinion (he began) we ought not always to
</p>
<p>repress certain bold tongues which mock at legends ; on the
</p>
<p>contrary, it is well that there should be men who cast some
</p>
<p>ridicule on that immense apotheosis of Papacy which we
</p>
<p>are accustomed to make in Oriental language. This sort
</p>
<p>of license does us no harm, so long as it is confined to the
</p>
<p>higher classes, and remains unknown to the people : a cer
</p>
<p>tain tolerance on this point makes the world more inclined
</p>
<p>to trust us, and serves to lull suspicion in the minds of your
</p>
<p>gilded phantoms (larve dorate) as to our ultimate projects.
</p>
<p>But if this mockery went forth into open day, so as to
</p>
<p>unseal the eyes of the vulgar ; or if some keen and pene
</p>
<p>trating spirit, drawing aside the corner of the veil, should
</p>
<p>point out the corrosive side of our doctrines, we must then
</p>
<p>make every effort to cover this audacious wretch with
</p>
<p>infamy, or denounce him as a dangerous conspirator,
</p>
<p>deserving of exemplary chastisement. Setting aside such
</p>
<p>extreme cases, it is rather to our advantage than otherwise
</p>
<p>that there should be here and there some cavillers at our
</p>
<p>vast dogmatic system ; for whilst free course is allowed to

</p>
<p>our conquests day by day.
</p>
<p>In order to render Catholicism attractive, let us strive
</p>
<p>to enlist in her cause the foremost statesmen and historical
</p>
<p>writers of our own times. Let us employ them to deck the
</p>
<p>past in golden hues ; to sweeten, for us, the bitter waters of
</p>
<p>the middle ages ; and help us to captivate mankind by the
</p>
<p>most alluring promises. Who knows but the day may come
</p>
<p>when the vaunting songs of the antagonists of Catholicism
</p>
<p>shall prove to have been swan music ? Let us suffer all
</p>
<p>these various labourers to go on working for us ; when the
</p>
<p>evening comes we will pay them, unlike the master in the
</p>
<p>parable, in good money of the middle ages (in buona moneta
</p>
<p>del medio evo)  of those middle ages which, in their fervent
</p>
<p>admiration of antiquity, they now so eagerly extol.
</p>
<p>In good truth, our times are become strangely delicate !
</p>
<p>Do they flatter themselves, then, that no spark still smoulders
</p>
<p>in the ashes round the stake to kindle another torch?
</p>
<p>Fools ! all they can do is to hate us ! They are far from
</p>
<p>dreaming (d'aver sentore, literally to scent) that we alone
</p>
<p>know how to prepare a revolution, compared with which
</p>
<p>all theirs have been, are, and will be but pigmy insurrections.
</p>
<p>In calling us Jesuits they think that they cover us with
</p>
<p>opprobrium ! They little think that these Jesuits have in
</p>
<p>store for them the consorship, gags, and flames, and will
</p>
<p>one day be the masters of their masters !
</p>
<p>Excuse this warmth, my dear colleagues ; at another

<p>time I will enlarge upon the immediate causes which fill me
</p>
<p>with indignation, and arouse all my energies against this

<p>envious and fractious race. I will now return to the point

</p>
<p>It is highly important to us that we should seem to
</p>
<p>offer large guarantees to every class of society. To the
</p>
<p>aristocracy of Protestant lands we should thus address
</p>
<p>ourselves : 
</p>
<p>" The Roman hierarchy alone is able to gain you the
</p>
<p>victory ; but this is on condition that she finds an echo in
</p>
<p>your own souls. It is by your efforts that the people must
</p>
<p>be collected into their former fold ; when safely there, the
</p>
<p>impetuous torrent will no longer ravage your domains, you
</p>
<p>will see that submission will be restored, and the bad spirit
</p>
<p>which threatens to root up and destroy all things, shall
</p>
<p>itself be rooted up and destroyed. Your fathers turned
</p>
<p>everything upside down, the remedy must be not less
</p>
<p>energetic than the evil. Call upon all those over whom
</p>
<p>you have influence to listen, and address them boldly in
</p>
<p>some such words as these: 
</p>
<p>" ' Protestantism is an aberration. It has engendered
</p>
<p>nothing but miseries and innumerable catastrophes.
</p>
<p>" ' It is a religion lopped of its members, it is not even
</p>
<p>a skeleton. " ' Catholicism alone presents a harmonious whole.
</p>
<p>Where there is no confession, no pope, no attractive form
</p>
<p>of worship to address itself to the senses, no rallying point,
</p>
<p>no all-powerful and ever acting controul, all must needs be
</p>
<p>scattered like sand. We offer ourselves to your example,
</p>
<p>as the first to prostrate ourselves before the guides of our
</p>
<p>conscience, the first to reject the apostacy of our fathers !
</p>
<p>Let it be our common task to join together what has been
</p>
<p>rent. To the great work then ! Aid us ! follow us ! '

<p>within them, their habits will be gradually changed, and at
</p>
<p>last with one impulse they will fall on their knees before
</p>
<p>our common mother."
</p>
<p>Furthermore, dear friends, we must foresee all things,
</p>
<p>especially objections, that we may be ready to answer them
</p>
<p>off-hand, and without hesitation ; for we can never succeed
</p>
<p>unless we have first, individually and collectively, made
</p>
<p>ourselves thoroughly conversant with our subject in all its
</p>
<p>bearings. Let each of us, therefore, hold himself bound to
</p>
<p>note with scrupulous fidelity, not only the arguments which
</p>
<p>are brought against us, but also the nature of the interests,
</p>
<p>fears, desires, and even the mixture of ideas, serious, extra
</p>
<p>vagant, or mystic, which are arrayed on the other side ; so
</p>
<p>that our answers, and our manner of considering their ideas,
</p>
<p>may astonish and bewilder them, and thus lead them captive
</p>
<p>to our cause.
</p>
<p>" Reflect," let us say, closely following them up,
</p>
<p>" you are not surely so blind as not to see what is passing
</p>
<p>around you. Lay hold on the anchor of safety which
</p>
<p>Rome offers you, if you indeed believe it strong enough to
</p>
<p>resist so many impetuous waves. The torrent is constantly
</p>
<p>widening and gaining force. The loss of even a single
</p>
<p>moment may afterwards be to you the source of vain
</p>
<p>regret. Call upon those who alone are powerful to save
</p>
<p>you, by raising against these raging waters an insurmount
</p>
<p>able and eternal barrier. Alone (non contando che su di
</p>
<p>voi), what could you do against the impending catastrophes ?

<p>people in the gigantic work of their own metamorphosis 
</p>
<p>a work which could never be executed but by the aid of
</p>
<p>expedients such as ours."
</p>
<p>I know, by experience, that this sort of language is of
</p>
<p>certain efficacy. No sooner shall a few of these person
</p>
<p>ages be converted, than others will imitate them ; and
</p>
<p>when there shall be, by these means, a few breaches made
</p>
<p>in Protestantism  whether these conversions proceed from
</p>
<p>genuine motives, or whether they be determined by advan
</p>
<p>tageous offers, which shall not be spared if the person be
</p>
<p>worth the trouble (ne vol la pena)  we may certainly
</p>
<p>reckon that the people, allured by these conversions, will
</p>
<p>not long resist the yoke of pure authority, and then we
</p>
<p>shall know how to make them pull steadily. For, I would
</p>
<p>not have it lost sight of that our chief concern must be to
</p>
<p>mould the people to our purposes. Doubtless, the first
</p>
<p>generation will not be wholly ours ; but the second will
</p>
<p>nearly belong to us, and the third entirely. Yes, the
</p>
<p>people are the vast domain we have to conquer ; and when
</p>
<p>we are free to cultivate it after our own way, we will
</p>
<p>make it fructify to the profit of the impoverished granary*
</p>
<p>* Here two words escaped me. I thought I heard the two
</p>
<p>syllables rito, and I imagine that the words pronounced must have
</p>
<p>been granario impoverito. It was a movement of hilarity, mingled, as it
</p>
<p>struck me, with some murmurs, which rendered these words unin
</p>
<p>telligible. But the Irishman, it is evident, took little pains to veil his
</p>
<p>thoughts. He had just compared the people to a vast plain, destined
</p>
<p>to be conquered and ploughed. It is become almost proverbial in
</p>
<p>Italy, and I heard it said by several aged priests, " that the granary of
</p>
<p>the holy city is impoverished." This is an allusion to the enormous

<p>loss on indulgences, dispensations, fyc, which Protestantism and modern

</p>
<p>ground. If I may tell you, openly, what I think of this
</p>
<p>book, it is not at all for us ; it is against us. I do not at
</p>
<p>all wonder at the invincible obstinacy it engenders in all
</p>
<p>those who regard its verses as inspired.
</p>
<p>You are aware that, when once entered upon theolo
</p>
<p>gical studies, we must of necessity make some acquaintance
</p>
<p>with the Bible. For myself, although in company with
</p>
<p>numerous fellow-students, mere machines accustomed to
</p>
<p>confound the text and the commentary, as if they were
</p>
<p>one and the same thing (an illusion which, to confess the
</p>
<p>truth, is extremely useful to us), it was yet impossible for
</p>
<p>me, endowed as I was with some capacity for reflection
</p>
<p>(as proved by my presence here, amongst the small number
</p>
<p>of the elect)  it was impossible for me, I repeat, to be so
</p>
<p>absurdly credulous as not to distinguish the text from the
</p>
<p>commentary, by which its sense is almost always distorted.
</p>
<p>In the simplicity of youth I fully expected, on opening the
</p>
<p>New Testament, to find there laid down, totidem Uteris
</p>
<p>(in lettere cubitali), the authority of a superior chief in the
</p>
<p>church, and the worship of the Virgin, the source of all
</p>
<p>grace for mankind. I sought with the same eagerness for
</p>
<p>the mass, for purgatory, for relics, &c. But in every page
</p>
<p>I found my expectations disappointed ; from every reflec
</p>
<p>tion that I made resulted doubt. At last, after having
</p>
<p>read, at least six times over, that little book which set all
</p>
<p>my calculations at nought, I was forced to acknowledge
</p>
<p>to myself that it actually sets forth a system of religion
</p>
<p>altogether different from that taught in the schools, and
</p>
<p>thus all my ideas were thrown into confusion (ne rimasi al
</p>
<p>sommo seompaginato).

</p>
<p>The penetrating eye of my confessor perceived the
</p>
<p>100 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>agitation of my mind, and I was consequently obliged to
</p>
<p>disclose to him my distress and difficulty. " Ah, reverend
</p>
<p>father!" I said to him, " I expected to find in the New
</p>
<p>Testament each of our different dogmas fully developed and
</p>
<p>dwelt upon in accordance with the value and importance
</p>
<p>which we are accustomed to attribute to them. What is
</p>
<p>my surprise to find there nothing at all like what we deem
</p>
<p>the most essential in our doctrines."
</p>
<p>Without allowing me to proceed any further, he in
</p>
<p>quired, " Have you communicated your thoughts to any of
</p>
<p>your fellow-students ?" " No," replied I, " I have suffered
</p>
<p>much  -but alone." "That is well," he said.
</p>
<p>From that moment he kept me apart from all the other
</p>
<p>students, and having repeatedly sounded my conscience to
</p>
<p>its very depths, he one day addressed this question to me,
</p>
<p>" My child" (I was at that time about twenty-three years
</p>
<p>of age), " if I were to place in your hands the Geography
</p>
<p>of Ptolemy, or that of Strabo, who lived about two thousand
</p>
<p>years ago, and if I were to say to you, Point out to me in
</p>
<p>these books the name of a single city of all those which
</p>
<p>have been since built, what would be your answer ?" " I
</p>
<p>should say that it was impossible, since those cities did not
</p>
<p>then exist." "Exactly so; and the case is absolutely the
</p>
<p>same with the New Testament  the book of primitive
</p>
<p>Christianity  as with the Geography of Ptolemy or Strabo.
</p>
<p>All you seek there had its rise at a far later period."
</p>
<p>At these words of my superior I looked upon him with
</p>
<p>stupefaction. He pressed me affectionately to his bosom,
</p>
<p>and said, " Do not distress yourself; you shall be a young
</p>
<p>man set apart. You are worthy to penetrate further than

<p>others. Jesus Christ himself, as you must have remarked,
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 10]
</p>
<p>spoke to the multitude only in parables ; but, in private,
</p>
<p>he interpreted these parables to the apostles, saying to
</p>
<p>them : ' To you it is given to know the mysteries of the
</p>
<p>kingdom,' that is to say, to possess the key of these secrets ;
</p>
<p>but he carefully avoided using this language to the vulgar.
</p>
<p>Do you think a child in the cradle is equally advanced
</p>
<p>with a grown man ? No. In like manner this book is but
</p>
<p>the embryo of the church. Forms,- new doctrines, the
</p>
<p>hierarchy, the power of the popedom, all these great things
</p>
<p>which have transformed the church into an ocean, as it
</p>
<p>were, have been the effect of gradual progress, a progress
</p>
<p>which has often, indeed, been impeded, often interrupted,
</p>
<p>but which we are destined to bring to its consummation."
</p>
<p>Afterwards, in order to neutralize my impressions, he
</p>
<p>placed in my hands Dupuis, Boulanger, Volney, Voltaire,
</p>
<p>and some other writers. By this means, and by degrees,
</p>
<p>a new order of ideas was established in my mind, and I
</p>
<p>became in the end capable of rising to the loftiest views of
</p>
<p>our order.
</p>
<p>I have related this anecdote, which is entirely personal,
</p>
<p>merely to put you on your guard against too much confi
</p>
<p>dence in reckoning, like the heretics, upon a book which
</p>
<p>unfortunately abounds in arms against us, not for us.
</p>
<p>Consequently, let us lay down this principle : in public
</p>
<p>to act as if we had nothing to fear from such a book, but
</p>
<p>rather as if it were favourable for us ; in private, to describe
</p>
<p>it as dangerous and hurtful, or, where this would not be
</p>
<p>prudent, to declare that it is the germ, of which Catholicism
</p>
<p>is the complete and majestic development. We shall thus

<p>provide ourselves with an arsenal a thousand times better
</p>
<p>stored than the biblical arsenal of Protestantism. We shall

<p>they conclude that if there had really been anything in the

<p>of our initiated members, our edifice will rise on founda

</p>
<p>As to our texts, let us select them from the old

<p>legends of the Bollandists. Should certain of our practices

<p>as to throw a glittering veil over the pope, the Virgin,

<p>He ceased. The speaker who succeeded him appeared younger.
</p>
<p>I cannot say whether he was an Italian or not. Our language is
</p>
<p>pronounced in so many different ways, that it is difficult to judge of
</p>
<p>a speaker's native country by his accent, more especially when we
</p>
<p>cannot observe his features. This speaker began by unfolding some
</p>
<p>perfidious theories, and his style was at first feeble and careless. I
</p>
<p>was astonished at his incoherence, hut by and by he was put on his
</p>
<p>mettle by an interruption, and his style suddenly became terse and
</p>
<p>compact. I know that we are accused of fearing the Scriptures ;
</p>
<p>wherefore I am, at this very time, occupied in composing
</p>
<p>a little book, in which I point out a very easy method of

<p>enriching our oral instructions and our writings by Scrip

<p>" If the church is a visible body, the simplest common

</p>
<p>" The Catholic people is successor to the people of
</p>
<p>God ; consequently heretics and philosophers are the
</p>
<p>enemies we are bound to exterminate, and the powers
</p>
<p>which do not yield obedience to the Holy See are so many
</p>
<p>Pharaohs." " As, under the Old Testament, the voice of the
</p>
<p>tabernacle was the voice of God, so, in like manner, the
</p>
<p>voice of the pope is the voice of God, under the New
</p>
<p>Covenant." I might quote to you a thousand other examples, with
</p>
<p>their application ; but the specimen I have just offered
</p>
<p>you will prove that we also, as well as the heretics, can
</p>
<p>present ourselves with a phraseology altogether Biblical.
</p>
<p>As to our manner of proceeding with Protestants of all
</p>
<p>sorts, it must necessarily be very varied. My advice is
</p>
<p>this, that we should keep a register of the most obstinate

</p>
<p>This register, in which their individual characters should

<p>be noted, would serve to warn our missionaries of the rocks

<p>and quicksands in their course ; they would know before
</p>
<p>hand with whom they had to do, whom to avoid, and whom
</p>
<p>to venture upon, according to the measure or the particular

<p>nature of their respective talents ; this would be of

<p>admirable use in sparing us many defeats and unfortunate

<p>hostile and more manageable, I argue thus :  " Is it not

</p>
<p>apparent that we alone combine all the advantages that
</p>
<p>your sects possess separately. You can, therefore, lose
</p>
<p>nothing by your conversion ; you gain, on the contrary,
</p>
<p>the advantages of becoming spectators of such imposing
</p>
<p>solemnities as must needs, sooner or later, captivate your
</p>
<p>very hearts.
</p>
<p>" Our church styles itself catholic, or universal ; this is
</p>
<p>why it employs sensuous vehicles proportioned to the
</p>
<p>intellectual faculties of each individual. Look upon
</p>
<p>Catholicism, then, as opening to mankind the most splendid
</p>
<p>feast. You know in what consists the merit of a table 
</p>
<p>in being laden with dishes adapted to every taste, and in
</p>
<p>displaying all the most delicious productions of the earth.
</p>
<p>Now, all men are not constituted alike. One man sees
</p>
<p>God through the medium of the fine arts and poetry ;
</p>
<p>another can only discern him under a gloomy and austere
</p>
<p>aspect ; a third beholds him in a sweet and radiant
</p>
<p>atmosphere ; and others see him through the cloud of
</p>
<p>dim and mystic reveries. For all, however, there is one
</p>
<p>centre of unity, namely, Jesus Christ ; and on this point
</p>
<p>we have not a shadow of disagreement with you. What,
</p>
<p>then, should hinder you from entering into the most perfect
</p>
<p>communion with us ? Would it not be folly to require that
</p>
<p>all men should arrive at the same point by one single
</p>
<p>road, when it is the property of a divine religion to lead
</p>
<p>them thither by a multitude of different ways ? Perhaps
</p>
<p>it may be repugnant to you to see God in the man to
</p>
<p>whom you confess yourself, in order to obtain absolution ?

</p>
<p>or, on the other hand, would become desperate, no longer
</p>
<p>hearing a voice which says, ' I am God who absolve
</p>
<p>thee.' " You would prefer, would you not, that a friend
</p>
<p>should be your priest? Enlightened minds seek the
</p>
<p>commerce of enlightened minds ; well, doubt not that
</p>
<p>Catholicism offers you a multitude of priests, who, knowing
</p>
<p>with whom they had to do, would never dream of imposing
</p>
<p>acts of humiliation upon you. As to our devotional
</p>
<p>practises, it is not necessary to take a part in them, further
</p>
<p>than for the edification of the simple (per V edificazione dei
</p>
<p>simplici). The church has too much perspicuity not to
</p>
<p>know how to make a discreet use of many of her different
</p>
<p>rules, so as to adapt them to all shades of intelligence, from
</p>
<p>the depths of ignorance to the heights of genius. Since
</p>
<p>her table is so richly provided, would it not be absurd that
</p>
<p>this very abundance should be the source of dissensions ?
</p>
<p>No ; restraint of this kind has never entered into the spirit
</p>
<p>of our system. Unity, that good thing beyond all price, is
</p>
<p>dear to us, but we know that sacrifices must be made in
</p>
<p>order to preserve it ; we know that reciprocal tolerance is
</p>
<p>necessary in the different guests seated at the same religious
</p>
<p>banquet, where the choice of meats is free, without any one
</p>
<p>having the right to constrain his neighbour ; and, by this
</p>
<p>touching and amiable forbearance, all are equally nourished
</p>
<p>and satisfied.
</p>
<p>"Remember St. Paul, who forbids us to despise the
</p>
<p>weak ; who will not that he who believes himself permitted
</p>
<p>to eat meat should trouble another who believes that by
</p>
<p>eating herbs only he renders himself agreeable to God.

<p>It is to you, Protestants, that St. Paul addresses himself
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 107
</p>
<p>when he says, ' Destroy not him with thy meat for whom
</p>
<p>Christ died.' Would that he had added, ' Destroy him

<p>not in exacting proudly that he should conform to your
</p>
<p>individual taste.'*

<p>" There are to be found in the kingdom of God different
</p>
<p>lights  from the pale light of the smallest star to the

<p>brilliant glory of the sun.
</p>
<p>" Apply this same spirit to different doctrines ; to that,
</p>
<p>for example, which gives you so much offence by placing
</p>
<p>all power in the hands of the pope. Doubtless this doc
</p>
<p>trine may be so explained to educated minds as to
</p>
<p>place it in a more elevated point of view, and even to
</p>
<p>give it the appearance of something rational and just ;
</p>
<p>but, for many reasons, it must be preached to the common
</p>
<p>people in all its downright crudity (in tuttala sua crudita
</p>
<p>materiale). " By degrees, as you are capable of comprehending the
</p>
<p>extended and noble views of our church, you will also
</p>
<p>perceive why she canonizes such totally dissimilar indi

<p>viduals  the being absorbed in an eccentric mysticism ;

<p>sprinkled with his blood ; and him who has revelled in

<p>* There would be no end if we were to point out the continual

<p>efforts of the reverend fathers to wrest the meaning of the texts they

<p>quote. St. Paul, having to do with weak consciences, accustomed to
</p>
<p>ascetic maxims, and wishing still to respect them, without prejudice to
</p>
<p>the new principle he was labouring to establish, thus speaks :  " For
</p>
<p>one believeth that he may eat all things ; another, who is weak, eateth
</p>
<p>herbs. Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not, and let

<p>attainable and legitimate. The reason is simply this, that
</p>
<p>human nature is multiform.
</p>
<p>" All things are good, all things are holy, when they
</p>
<p>are in their right place, and when men do not seek to
</p>
<p>intrude upon every one their own exclusive principles. Is
</p>
<p>it difficult to perceive that this mode of conduct is both
</p>
<p>generous and sublime ?"
</p>
<p>After having thus argued, but at greater length, I
</p>
<p>change my tactics ; I analyze Protestantism even to its
</p>
<p>most trifling details. I show from whence it came forth ; I
</p>
<p>display its shameful variations, the pernicious example it
</p>
<p>has given, the consequences of its freedom of inquiry, and
</p>
<p>its miserable outward dryness, betokening its inward sterility.
</p>
<p>Then I exclaim, " See one of our grand processions ! every
</p>
<p>one occupies his peculiar rank ; for our church, even in
</p>
<p>her grand solemnities, loves not to eclipse the honour due
</p>
<p>to any state or condition.
</p>
<p>" You are astonished, perhaps, to see us adore the
</p>
<p>Host, surrounded with glittering magnificence. We, too,
</p>
<p>are not ignorant that God is everywhere ; and that He
</p>
<p>demands the heart alone, is not a discovery of your pre
</p>
<p>tended reformers. But tell me, I pray you, when have the
</p>
<p>people been able to comprehend all these chimerical
</p>
<p>abstractions ? Has there not at all times been need of
</p>
<p>certain signs to serve as steps, as it were, by which men
</p>
<p>might ascend to the ideal of religion ?
</p>
<p>" Thus the church, perceivingthat the Lord's Supper, in
</p>
<p>its primitive and vulgar simplicity, was ill adapted to excite
</p>
<p>devotion in the people, decided at last to concentrate upon
</p>
<p>the Host, by the mass, as upon a palpable and perceptible

<p>point, all the splendour they could give it. The church
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 109
</p>
<p>has signally succeeded, by means of frequent exhibitions
</p>
<p>of the august sacrament, and by the pomp of her cere
</p>
<p>monies. The multitude, carried away by what is visible, is
</p>
<p>moved and softened, and adoration succeeds to admiration.
</p>
<p>" Without these Catholic means, is it not to be justly
</p>
<p>feared that the number of those who never raise their hearts
</p>
<p>towards God would increase to an alarming extent ?
</p>
<p>" On the other hand, the enlightened man, the true
</p>
<p>philosopher, who has really no need of these material forms,
</p>
<p>would not, surely, attempt to impose his own spiritualism on
</p>
<p>beings whose destiny it is to remain material and gross.
</p>
<p>He will be content with admiring the ingenious resources of
</p>
<p>Catholicism, and he will thank God for having enabled the
</p>
<p>church to find means so adapted to awaken the piety of the
</p>
<p>stupid and ignorant mass.
</p>
<p>" Thus, under the roofs of our temples, children and
</p>
<p>men* tend to the same point, thanks to the divine and
</p>
<p>inexhaustible fecundity of the true church, which, as St.
</p>
<p>Paul says, makes itself all things to all men, in order to
</p>
<p>gain, if it be possible, the whole world, without, however,
</p>
<p>sacrificing the truth, by thus temporising."
</p>
<p>* Under the name of children the father no doubt designates the
</p>
<p>lower orders, whom they design to keep under the yoke of superstitious
</p>
<p>practices ; whilst by men he means those who disdain these practices,
</p>
<p>but who, adroitly veiling this, deserve the name of true philosophers.
</p>
<p>I have known priests, and even Protestant ministers, who reject many
</p>
<p>doctrines which they publicly preach ; amongst others, everlasting
</p>
<p>punishment; and these, they say, Scripture authorises them to reject,

</p>
<p>1 LO SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>VII.
</p>
<p>From the first words of the discourse which follows, I had no diffi
</p>
<p>culty in recognising the unctuous voice which had put so many
</p>
<p>insidious questions to me, during my examination. This was the
</p>
<p>present general of the company, Father Boothaan. I felt at first
</p>
<p>considerable agitation, so that I lost two or three phrases, which were
</p>
<p>however unimportant, and which I have supplied in order to complete
</p>
<p>the sense. The most fatal thing that could befal us at the present
</p>
<p>moment, would be the change from a gay, glittering, scenic
</p>
<p>religion, to an argumentative Christianity, opposed to pomp
</p>
<p>and show, an iconoclastic spirituality ; I mean by this term,
</p>
<p>a faith destructive of Catholic forms. You all know that
</p>
<p>these are the powerful shield which covers our plans. But
</p>
<p>if the poetic charm should ever be broken, if people
</p>
<p>should begin to seek inspiration in the apostles, or in the
</p>
<p>primitive apologists, then our bark, beaten by impetuous
</p>
<p>winds, would run great risk of sinking, with all the immen
</p>
<p>sity of its treasures. Revolt would become general. The
</p>
<p>glorious edifice, the work of so many ages, would be assailed
</p>
<p>and torn to pieces by thousands of profane hands. It would
</p>
<p>become the order of the day to trample under foot all that
</p>
<p>might fall under the reproach of being borrowed from idol-
</p>
<p>atory. This time, there would be no mercy shown, nothing
</p>
<p>would be spared. Discouragement and terror would then
</p>
<p>stalk through our ranks, for we could not rely for the
</p>
<p>suppression of these movements on the strong hands of
</p>
<p>certain powers, which we had not yet sufficiently engaged in
</p>
<p>our interests. As soon as the fatal word should have

</p>
<p>gone forth, that nothing had any value in religion but
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. Ill
</p>
<p>what is spiritual and biblical, the hierarchy would instantly
</p>
<p>fall to the ground. All hope would be over for the priest
</p>
<p>hood, when the people should acknowledge no other guide
</p>
<p>than a little book. To whom should we then turn, on
</p>
<p>whom should we found our expectations, in a desertion so
</p>
<p>general ; what remedy should we seek to cure so horrible
</p>
<p>a malady in the blood ? (per guarir nel sagnue un si oribile
</p>
<p>male.) Not that there is the least symptom of the approach
</p>
<p>of such a danger. On the contrary, Protestantism is
</p>
<p>becoming decomposed ; it is falling to pieces ; we are
</p>
<p>beginning to gain from it some men of note, and there
</p>
<p>are even some high personages whom we have succeeded in
</p>
<p>convincing that, if they continue to uphold Protestantism,
</p>
<p>they are lost.
</p>
<p>But it is not enough for us to be aware of a great
</p>
<p>apathy amongst our ancient enemies ; we must do all in our
</p>
<p>power to augment it.
</p>
<p>The proof that faith in an abstract being is powerless
</p>
<p>to constitute a solid and durable union  that it cannot form
</p>
<p>a vast body which shall be animated, as it were, by one
</p>
<p>mind, is, that scarcely three hundred years have passed
</p>
<p>since the first effervescence, and Protestantism is already
</p>
<p>wearing out and sinking into decay. Yes, we are destined
</p>
<p>to insult its last agfbnies, to march over its broken skeleton
</p>
<p>and its scattered bones ! Oh ! let us hasten this dissolution
</p>
<p>by our strong and united efforts ! Let us preach to the
</p>
<p>timorous Protestants that deism and incredulity are corrup-
</p>
<p>ing their various sects, that God is, at length, weary of
</p>
<p>heresies, and that he is now, in our days, about to exercise

<p>upon them his terrible and final judgment.
</p>
<p>112 SECRET PLAN
</p>
<p>Let us, meanwhile, carefully avoid entering into an
</p>
<p>open and serious strife with the Protestants. We could not
</p>
<p>but lose ground by it ; and it would call too much attention
</p>
<p>to the subject. People who are greedy of novelty would
</p>
<p>be enchanted to see such a combat opened. Let us prefer
</p>
<p>a secret war, which though less brilliant, is more sure to
</p>
<p>bring us the advantage. Let us shun too much light. Let us
</p>
<p>content ourselves with pulling down the stones of the Protes
</p>
<p>tant citadel, one by one, instead of venturing to carry it by
</p>
<p>storm. This would be neither prudent nor useful. Let us
</p>
<p>pour contempt upon this inglorious, naked, cadaverous
</p>
<p>religion ; and let us exalt the antiquity, the harmonies,
</p>
<p>and the wonderful perfectibility of our own.
</p>
<p>But we must, above all things, be provided with a store
</p>
<p>of arguments to parry the objections which the Protestants
</p>
<p>are so prone to bring forward, and which are founded on
</p>
<p>the vices and crimes of the ancient clergy and the popes.
</p>
<p>A difficult theme, I admit, and one which merits a special
</p>
<p>theory ; for after all, what have we to allege sufficiently
</p>
<p>adroit, subtle, and cogent, to enable us to retire with
</p>
<p>honour from these discussions with which we are so often
</p>
<p>pestered ? If we could but meet them armed with some
</p>
<p>good replies, the question might, at least, be maintained in
</p>
<p>suspense. You well know that the ground upon which thei
</p>
<p>Protestants are most harassing, is the middle ages, which
</p>
<p>they are pleased to call the dark ages. Unfortunately, on
</p>
<p>this subject our best writers do but too often furnish our
</p>
<p>adversaries with arms against us !
</p>
<p>O Rome ! how many anxious toils, how many pangs of
</p>
<p>mortification, dost thou cost us ! What an overwhelming

<p>ble to give an idea of the contrast between this sudden burst, and the

<p>usually calm and smooth manner of Father Boothaan.)

<p>" We have, however, one source of rejoicing . we cherish
</p>
<p>at the bottom of our hearts this principle, that whatever
</p>
<p>does not unite with us, must be annihilated ; and we hold
</p>
<p>ourselves ready to make, as soon as we shall have the
</p>
<p>means, an energetic application of this principle. Protes
</p>
<p>tantism, on the contrary, completely disarmed itself when
</p>
<p>first it preached the doctrine of toleration, and declared that
</p>
<p>to persecute for the sake of religion, is a violation of the
</p>
<p>gospel. O yes ! this is well for those who are satisfied with
</p>
<p>small things, but not for us who aim at greatness which
</p>
<p>shall eclipse and annul all other greatness.

<p>VIII.
</p>
<p>The Irishman here took up the discourse so promptly that he
</p>
<p>seemed to have been waiting impatiently for an opportunity to break
</p>
<p>in. There was no speaker whom I found it so difficult to follow.
</p>
<p>I will tell you, brethren, by what means we can mould
</p>
<p>and train up the true Roman Catholic in the midst of the

<p>heretic sects. With devoted bishops, and with a clergy
</p>
<p>whose tactics have been perfected by a serious course of

<p>study, we may prepare for the people such instructors as

<p>carefully preserving towards them, at the same time, a
</p>
<p>polite and gracious manner. In other words, he must make
</p>
<p>a show of much sociability towards the Protestants, hut he
</p>
<p>must avoid all intellectual contact or communion with
</p>
<p>them. This is what we must inculcate as the only
</p>
<p>condition of success in every exercise of our ministry,
</p>
<p>whether by catechism, confession, or conversation. This
</p>
<p>is our only chance for reuniting what is broken, strengthen
</p>
<p>ing what is weak, and magnifying what is small.
</p>
<p>Every bishop must rigorously act upon this principle 
</p>
<p>be gentle, but inflexible. Let him know how to assume
</p>
<p>the demeanour of a lamb, if he would spread around him a
</p>
<p>perfume of sanctity which shall win all hearts ; but let
</p>
<p>him also know how to act with the fierceness of a raging
</p>
<p>lion when he is called upon to protect the rights of the
</p>
<p>church, or to reclaim those of which it has already been
</p>
<p>despoiled by the tyranny of governments. If the bishops
</p>
<p>and the clergy, however, know how to do their duty, these
</p>
<p>rights shall all resume their paramount supremacy.
</p>
<p>One of the dangers upon which our system may strike
</p>
<p>is the policy of Protestant governments. They have
</p>
<p>assumed the art of affecting a desire to do us justice, and
</p>
<p>profess even much condescendence towards those whom they
</p>
<p>disdainfully denominate Papists. It is their design to break
</p>
<p>down an isolation which it deeply imports us to maintain ;
</p>
<p>were they to awaken sympathy and efface the limits of
</p>
<p>separation, our plan would be ruined to its very base.

<p>My brethren, let us defeat such manoeuvres, cost what

</p>
<p>it may, by manoeuvres more skilful and more active. I
</p>
<p>will name one which I have sometimes known to succeed,
</p>
<p>and which I consider efficacious. The confessional must
</p>
<p>be our field of action, wherein we must undeceive all who
</p>
<p>are in danger of being taken by so perfidious a bait. Let
</p>
<p>us convince the faithful that silence towards us is a crime ;
</p>
<p>that it is fear and not good-will that actuates their tyrants ;
</p>
<p>that he who has penetration enough to see through these
</p>
<p>wiles, so far from believing that there is affection and
</p>
<p>kindness in them, perceives nothing but a deep design to
</p>
<p>weaken our force and to loosen our bond of religion.
</p>
<p>These governments are well aware that an alliance with
</p>
<p>Catholics would, sooner or later, enable them to dispute
</p>
<p>the right of Catholic princes to govern populations which
</p>
<p>have nothing in common with them. We must, therefore,
</p>
<p>repeat to the faithful at the confessional, and this under the
</p>
<p>seal of the most scrupulous secrecy :  " Refrain sedulously
</p>
<p>from sacrificing all your future hopes to a vile temporary
</p>
<p>interest, or you will prepare for your children a worse
</p>
<p>slavery than your own ! Heresy is on the watch, to see
</p>
<p>you bow your heads under the yoke of her execrable doc

</p>
<p>to cover with flowers the victim which was led to the altar.

<p>is to enlighten you on your true interests, on your rights,

<p>to escape their snares."
</p>
<p>We know but too well, dear brethren, how many stones

<p>are scattered over those mixed and bastard countries.
</p>
<p>Let us take the trouble to search for these stones and

<p>which shall daily become more ponderous, more rugged,

<p>more irresistible, until its whole crushing mass shall fall
</p>
<p>upon the head of heresy !
</p>
<p>Let us also send abroad our mysterious words,* which

<p>shall cast forth vivid flashes of our doctrine, to dazzle,

<p>will merit altars and statues. Worthy will he be that we
</p>
<p>should ascribe miracles to him, and that we should declare
</p>
<p>him the celestial patron of the people, the man who shall
</p>
<p>solve this arduous problem. What must we do to recruit

<p>such an army, organize and discipline it so as to make it
</p>
<p>exclusively subservient to the triumph of our ideas ?
</p>
<p>To isolate those whom we may have gained over, to
</p>
<p>allow them no other aliment than the bread and wine of
</p>
<p>our table, and by degrees transform them into raging lions
</p>
<p> this must be our main pursuit.
</p>
<p>We have, however, an immense variety of motives
</p>
<p>and interests with which we may work. To certain men,
</p>
<p>we must offer bribes of earthly good ; to others, we must
</p>
<p>promise crowns of eternal life ; some may be incited by the

<p>progress of the general welfare ; others are capable of

<p>if you were to imitate us, your governments would be more
</p>
<p>stable. Only lend us a helping hand, and we will show
</p>
<p>you how to come at the statistics of each individual head.
</p>
<p>In this respect, at least, we are your masters. In your

<p>religion you leave people's minds to themselves, which pro
</p>
<p>duces, as you well know, all kinds of revolutions and many
</p>
<p>catastrophes. Adopt confessors. Let your youths submit
</p>
<p>their thoughts, from their earliest years, to a director of
</p>
<p>their conscience. Think of the immense influence of prin

<p>ciples which men of the sanctuary deposit in a youthful
</p>
<p>breast ! Show yourselves favourable to that clergy which,
</p>
<p>bending over a soul thus subjected, reads it as if it were an

<p>unsealed letter. The clergy would be grateful to you.
</p>
<p>Let it have an interest in serving you, so that it may warn
</p>
<p>you opportunely when the tide is rising or falling in each
</p>
<p>country, and enable you to turn public events to your own

<p>profit. Doubt not that if this alliance of religion with politics

<p>could be brought to bear on the whole human race, the
</p>
<p>latter would universally become as wax in your hands, to

<p>mould it as you pleased, and stamp it with your own seal."
</p>
<p>It is needless to say that language like this is not to be

<p>proclaimed from the house-tops ; it is to be adroitly insinu

<p>ated into the ears of such as might be of vast utility to us,

<p>when struck by such glimmerings of light. Let them once

<p>OF THE JESUITS. 121
</p>
<p>The Jesuit who spoke next expressed himself in the purest Italian.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the construction of his phrases, and the lucid precision
</p>
<p>of his method, induced me to think that he also was French. The
</p>
<p>cast of his phrases was so much after the French manner, that I had
</p>
<p>scarcely an effort in translating his speech.
</p>
<p>Tbe stiff-necked heretics of whom he speaks are the Protestants of
</p>
<p>the higher classes, not the vulgar.
</p>
<p>It is chiefly as to the anarchic tendencies of free inquiry
</p>
<p>that we should attack those stiff-necked heretics, and I have
</p>
<p>often spoken to them thus : 
</p>
<p>"If there is anything utterly inexplicable to reason
</p>
<p>able people, it is your conduct. You allow free inquiry
</p>
<p>in religion ; is not this equivalent to permitting, legitimiz
</p>
<p>ing, nay, even provoking it, on all political questions also ?
</p>
<p>If you admit of so great a licence in a matter altogether
</p>
<p>divine and immutable  a matter so profound and abstruse
</p>
<p>as religion is, even for the learned few  is it not the height
</p>
<p>of inconsistency to hope to enslave the minds of men by
</p>
<p>forbidding them all inquiry into a subject so thoroughly
</p>
<p>human and variable as politics ? On the one hand, you
</p>
<p>expect to exercise sovereign and unquestioned authority,
</p>
<p>whilst, on the other, where God and the church are at
</p>
<p>stake, you assist in shaking off the yoke of an authority a
</p>
<p>thousand times more sacred and more necessary ! Surely
</p>
<p>it would be impossible to conceive a contradiction more
</p>
<p>palpable and absurd.
</p>
<p>" Its consequences are obvious. When, for mere tem

</p>
<p>against the church, the same disaster soon fell upon them
</p>
<p>selves. They had to endure, in their turn, an examination
</p>
<p>still more severe than that to which Rome had been sub
</p>
<p>jected  an examination of their dynastic rights, their codes,
</p>
<p>their actions  an examination which took place by the
</p>
<p>glare of a fearful conflagration, and which sent them to
</p>
<p>perish ignominiously on the scaffold like highway rob
</p>
<p>bers. " Such are the fruits of free inquiry. If it multiplies,
</p>
<p>everywhere its pestilential pulpits, the usual effects will
</p>
<p>inevitably follow. Hence I draw the following conclu
</p>
<p>sions : 
</p>
<p>" If ever the aristocracy of our church shall be laid low,
</p>
<p>all other aristocracies will perish likewise.
</p>
<p>" If ever the Catholic church be decapitated, all other
</p>
<p>monarchies will share the same fate.
</p>
<p>" If ever the purple of our cardinals be profaned and
</p>
<p>torn into rags, all other purples will be rent in like
</p>
<p>manner. " If ever our worship be despoiled of its pomp and
</p>
<p>grandeur, there will be an end of every other pomp and
</p>
<p>grandeur on earth.
</p>
<p>"We will not flatter you as courtiers do ; we will tell
</p>
<p>you the whole truth, in the hope that, for our mutual
</p>
<p>benefit, you may arrive at these simple and sure conclusions :
</p>
<p>if the Roman church lives we shall all live with her ; if she
</p>
<p>perishes, none of the grandeurs which have hitherto, in
</p>
<p>fact, been supported by Catholicism will survive the down

<p>fall of that infinite grandeur, the foremost of all, and before

<p>which the universe has so long prostrated itself. But if,

</p>
<p>your arms, whilst they yet may, drive them back to their

<p>forsaken ways ; then, in the place of infinite disorders, we
</p>
<p>shall have the union of the two powers, which shall go
</p>
<p>on daily increasing until it become perfectly consolidated.
</p>
<p>" Give us, then, your sympathies ; turn your faces
</p>
<p>towards us ; throw discredit on Protestantism ; and let
</p>
<p>Catholicism, enthroned by your aid in the opinions of our
</p>
<p>times, lift up her head, spread her dominion over the whole
</p>
<p>world, and completely subdue it. And this will inevitably
</p>
<p>take place, if men of high station will fearlessly declare
</p>
<p>themselves converted ; provided (and this is very important)
</p>
<p>that their change can in no way be attributed to motives of
</p>
<p>interest. "Can you, indeed, deny that the present rage for inno

<p>vation has arisen from the movement occasioned by
</p>
<p>Protestantism in throwing the Bible before the senseless
</p>
<p>multitude ? The first thing, therefore, to be done is to
</p>
<p>bring them back from the Bible to Catholic authority, which
</p>
<p>retrenches from this book only what is hurtful, allowing
</p>
<p>free circulation to those portions of it alone which ensure
</p>
<p>good order.
</p>
<p>" How conies it to pass that so many shallow minds make
</p>
<p>bold to fashion their own set of opinions ? Is it not because
</p>
<p>you have abolished all subjection to the tribunal of con
</p>
<p>sciences, which alone watched over the thoughts, and put
</p>
<p>a bridle on the lips ? Consequently, this tribunal must be
</p>
<p>restored, and in order that every one may respect it, the

<p>part a rich one ? You can little imagine what the church
</p>
<p>has in store to reward services of such importance."
</p>
<p>Here a slight murmur of derision caused a moment's interruption.
</p>
<p>" For, when once our renovated cult shall have regained
</p>
<p>all that heresy has snatched from it, Catholicism, which
</p>
<p>disdains the paltry spirit of Protestantism, will open wide
</p>
<p>the gates of her temples, that each rank, each estate, may
</p>
<p>there shine in its respective place. Being herself great,
</p>
<p>she naturally sympathizes with all that may add to her
</p>
<p>splendour. Those are madmen or fools, who, by their
</p>
<p>scheme for despoiling the churches of whatever could give
</p>
<p>them an imposing aspect, have made the nakedness of
</p>
<p>poverty conducive to that other mania of universal equality.
</p>
<p>" Lend us then, we implore you, your aid to put down

<p>every obstacle to the mutual understanding of the two
</p>
<p>authorities  the church and the throne. It is only when
</p>
<p>these two authorities shall be regarded as divine dogmas,
</p>
<p>and when they mutually sustain each other, that they will
</p>
<p>have sufficient power to sweep away all this chaos of
</p>
<p>dangerous questions which converts society into a tumult
</p>
<p>uous sea. What glorious results will follow, on the other
</p>
<p>hand, from this happy union, this fraternal alliance ! The

<p>There was a pause of some moments. A conversation took place,
</p>
<p>so general and unconnected that it was impossible for me to seize its
</p>
<p>meaning. But Father Boothaan soon resumed the discourse, and his
</p>
<p>first words, no doubt, related to this short conversation.
</p>
<p>To this effect I would remark that we shall establish
</p>
<p>nothing firmly unless we begin with those who are to direct
</p>
<p>others. It therefore appears to me essential to regulate
</p>
<p>the initiation, by forming various grades in it (stadii). I
</p>
<p>say regulate, because we must never risk our light but
</p>
<p>upon sure grounds, and after a rigid scrutiny of the dis
</p>
<p>positions of the person to be initiated. A ray too much,
</p>
<p>sometimes, instead of enlightening (imbaldanzire) him to
</p>
<p>whom it is communicated, serves only to dazzle him and
</p>
<p>lead him astray. We thus lose some excellent and active
</p>
<p>instruments, from having imprudently attempted to enlarge
</p>
<p>their mission. Let us know well beforehand with whom
</p>
<p>we have to do.
</p>
<p>We must not, however, suffer a reasonable cautiousness
</p>
<p>to degenerate into excessive distrust. Let frequent essays
</p>
<p>be made in order to acquire extreme delicacy of tact, and
</p>
<p>that discernment of the inner man by which we may assure
</p>
<p>ourselves of a person's secret thoughts. It is well to begin
</p>
<p>by complaining of the evils with which the church is
</p>
<p>oppressed, and then to insist on the necessity of strongly
</p>
<p>attaching the inferior clergy to their bishops, in order that
</p>
<p>they may aid each other in seeking a remedy. The con
</p>
<p>versation being thus opened, it seldom fails, if adroitly
</p>
<p>followed up, to bring out the true character of the indi-

<p>vidual under examination. After having thus sounded
</p>
<p>him, a word may be hazarded on the urgency of uniting
</p>
<p>men distinguished by rank or talent (always supposing
</p>
<p>that he is himself of this class), in order to raise up a dam
</p>
<p>against the torrent, and ultimately put the church in
</p>
<p>possession of her ancient sceptre. And if his replies denote
</p>
<p>that he is capable of understanding us, the means to be
</p>
<p>employed in attaining this great end may next be hinted
</p>
<p>to him. He may afterwards be wrought upon by letters,
</p>
<p>and if he shows himself apt, some sparks may be imparted
</p>
<p>to him of the vast idea which animates us.
</p>
<p>Yes, there are doubtless many on whom these words,
</p>
<p>prayer, religion, church, glory of God, conversion of sinners,
</p>
<p>exercise a magic power. There are others for whom there
</p>
<p>is a divine meaning in the words abolition of slavery,
</p>
<p>reformation of abuses, love of humanity, instruction of the
</p>
<p>people, universal charity. Well, let us sing in all these
</p>
<p>keys (cantiamo su questi tuoni medesimi), and let us
</p>
<p>not be sparing of the characteristic terms of their lan
</p>
<p>guage. Let us say that Catholicism alone knows how
</p>
<p>to inspire philanthropy and heroism, and proofs of this will
</p>
<p>not fail us. But, under cover of all these forms, we must
</p>
<p>never lose sight of our final project.
</p>
<p>Assuredly it is for our highest interest that a pope
</p>
<p>should be elected who is fundamentally Catholic ; but if the
</p>
<p>greater number insist on a rational pope, be it so, on con
</p>

<p>hands.* And we will not be sparing of our eulogiums on

</p>
<p>order that we may, in time, convert them into instruments
</p>
<p>for our own use.
</p>
<p>But this is not enough. To ensure success to our
</p>
<p>efforts, we require instruments well proved, and of a nature
</p>
<p>to resist all seduction. We must, on recruiting them, gain
</p>
<p>them over to our doctrines by whatever is most flattering
</p>
<p>to their desires. This is the surest way of making zealous
</p>
<p>and prudent propagators. Let all courts, and particularly
</p>
<p>those of heretic princes, be provided with some of our most
</p>
<p>vigilant sentinels, who must be wholly ours, although
</p>
<p>belonging, in appearance, to the Protestant sect ; in order
</p>
<p>that nothing may escape us, whether to our profit or our
</p>
<p>disadvantage, of all that passes in the cabinet and the con
</p>
<p>sistory. We must hesitate at no cost when it imports us to
</p>
<p>gain possession of a secret.
</p>
<p>I, too, earnestly desire a solution of this most difficult
</p>
<p>point  how to isolate the Catholics without their appearing
</p>
<p>in any way to be isolated. I confess that this appears to
</p>
<p>me almost impossible to be attained amongst the common
</p>
<p>people, because they have not been, like us, from their early
</p>
<p>years subjected to a fixed and inflexible discipline. Never
</p>
<p>theless, we can fashion men to what form we will, when
</p>
<p>powerful interests do violence, as it were, to their minds.
</p>
<p>The bishops, as well as the clergy, must learn the necessity
</p>
<p>of realizing this plan. But since a knowledge of the means
</p>
<p>of execution is indispensable, it must be our task to select
</p>
<p>them and inculcate them. Our business is to contrive : 
</p>
<p>1st, That the Catholics be imbued with hatred for the
</p>
<p>heretics, whoever they may be ; and that this hatred shall
</p>
<p>constantly increase, and bind them closely to each other.

</p>
<p>transpire until the day when it shall be appointed to break
</p>
<p>forth. 3rd, That this secret hate be combined with great
</p>
<p>activity in endeavouring to detach the faithful from every
</p>
<p>government inimical to us, and employ them, when they
</p>
<p>shall form a detached body, to strike deadly blows at heresy.
</p>
<p>Let us bring all our skill to bear upon the development
</p>
<p>of this part of our plan. For myself, it is my intention to
</p>
<p>devote myself especially to it.
</p>
<p>When we shall once have become familiar with these
</p>
<p>schemes, and when our store of expedients shall have been
</p>
<p>sufficiently augmented, I doubt not that the system which
</p>
<p>now seems crude and confused, will assume a very different
</p>
<p>aspect. We shall have brought it to a degree of perfection,
</p>
<p>such as our present vague and obscure notions can scarcely
</p>
<p>foreshadow. It is fortunate for us that the catechism of each diocese
</p>
<p>contains the precious element upon which our dogma is
</p>
<p>founded  that God is to be obeyed rather than men.
</p>
<p>These simple words contain all that we require for the
</p>
<p>papacy. If we teach (and who shall prevent us from doing
</p>
<p>so ?) that the pope is the vicar of God, it follows that the
</p>
<p>pope speaks absolutely in the place of God. It is the pope,
</p>
<p>then, who is to be obeyed rather than men.
</p>
<p>This is the bond of which every confessor must make
</p>
<p>use, in order to bind the faithful indissolubly to the chariot
</p>
<p>of Rome. Even in the Catholic States doth not the pulpit
</p>
<p>bear this inscripion of servitude : " Usque hue venies, neque
</p>
<p>ultra ? " But happily this is not the case with the confes
</p>
<p>sional. That place is not profaned by any such insulting

<p>restrictions. There God reigns supreme, and, from the
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 129
</p>
<p>great dogma, the clergy (as long as it shows itself the
</p>
<p>worthy and legitimate organ of the pope) derives the
</p>
<p>privilege of being obeyed as God himself.
</p>
<p>The catechism thus explained, so as to support the chief
</p>
<p>developments of our doctrines, we must from time to time
</p>
<p>hint that the rights of the Holy See may be momentarily
</p>
<p>forgotten, God so permitting, in order to punish the blind
</p>
<p>ness of the people ; but that these rights can never be
</p>
<p>annulled, since it is foretold that they shall one day revive
</p>
<p>in greater lustre than ever.
</p>
<p>Now, one of the means which I judge proper to promote
</p>
<p>this spirit of isolation and proud self-reliance which is so
</p>
<p>important to us, is the transmission by declared participa
</p>
<p>tion of the all-powerfulness of the papacy, not only to the
</p>
<p>hierarchical body, but to the faithful, in their relations with
</p>
<p>those obstinate heretics ; on condition, however, that they
</p>
<p>never lose sight of its indivisible unity. What a flattering
</p>
<p>attribute ! what a fertile sjjtource of religious exaltation !
</p>
<p>Could anything be conceived more adapted to knit our
</p>
<p>forces together and render them invincible ?
</p>
<p>One thing we cannot be too earnest and indefatigable
</p>
<p>in proclaiming, namely, that the Catholic religion alone
</p>
<p>possesses the truth and the life ; that he who holds it is at
</p>
<p>peace with his conscience ; that its orthodoxy does not
</p>
<p>depend upon its chiefs or its priests ; that, were they
</p>
<p>monsters of wickedness, their shame and punishment must
</p>
<p>be upon their own heads ; that their crimes could only be
</p>
<p>looked upon as those clouds which sometimes obscure the
</p>
<p>brightness of the sun ; that the stability of the church, its
</p>
<p>holiness, and its virtue do not depend upon the characters of

</p>

</p>
<p>of being the centre of unity ; that it presents the sign of
</p>
<p>salvation, on which we must fix our eyes, as did the Israelites
</p>
<p>upon the serpent in the desert, and not upon the failings of
</p>
<p>the clergy ! If a divine liquor is poured from vessels of clay,
</p>
<p>instead of vessels of gold, is it on that account the less
</p>
<p>precious ?
</p>
<p>Only let such arguments as these be seasoned with
</p>
<p>vivid eloquence, and take my word for it that even those
</p>
<p>who pass for enlightened people will not fail to be taken
</p>
<p>(tolti) by them just like the rest.
</p>
<p>Let us also persist in declaring that if Catholicism gains
</p>
<p>the victory, and becomes free to act according to the spirit
</p>
<p>of God, it will work out the happiness of mankind ; that,
</p>
<p>consequently, to labour in order to break the chains in
</p>
<p>which the world and the powers of the world have bound it,
</p>
<p>to devote ourselves, soul and body, to its emancipation, is to
</p>
<p>make so many sacrifices for the propagation of the holiest
</p>
<p>doctrines, and for the noblest progress of humanity. Can
</p>
<p>the triumph of the cause of God lead to any other end than
</p>
<p>the final triumph of the most generous principles that have
</p>
<p>ever warmed and stirred the heart of man ?
</p>
<p>I, too, am of opinion that it is advisable to make
</p>
<p>frequent use of the Bible. Does not a prism reflect all
</p>
<p>existing colours ? and can our system fail to reflect one
</p>
<p>single idea of all those which pass through men's imagina
</p>
<p>tions? No ; to set aside the Bible would be to tarnish our
</p>
<p>beautiful prism. I will suggest a few instances of the
</p>
<p>mode in which it may be used.

<p>OF THE JESUITS. 131
</p>
<p>remind our hearers incessantly of the captivity of Babylon,
</p>
<p>the bondage in Egypt, the conquest of the land of Canaan,
</p>
<p>of the ark, the splendours of Solomon's temple, the authority
</p>
<p>of the high-priest, his superb vestments, the tithes, &c, &c.
</p>
<p>Even these few examples, you see, furnish us with
</p>
<p>texts innumerable, wherewith to foster the spirit of antipathy
</p>
<p>and separation, and to hallow all the sensuous and gorgeous
</p>
<p>parade of the church.
</p>
<p>The Christian allegories may be turned to good account.
</p>
<p>We may say that God designs for extermination, like the
</p>
<p>Canaanites, all the nations that obstinately refuse to enter
</p>
<p>into the unity of the church ; and that the vicar of Jesus
</p>
<p>Christ is appointed to execute these judgments in due time.
</p>
<p>Let the Catholics commit themselves with implicit trust
</p>
<p>into the hands of the s'overeign pontiff, who is tlieir only
</p>
<p>guide ; God will hasten the day, when, not to speak of the
</p>
<p>happiness which awaits them in another life, he will make
</p>
<p>them the sole arbiters of all things here below.
</p>
<p>Let us, on all occasions, impress upon the people, that
</p>
<p>if they will only be united and obedient, they will become
</p>
<p>strong, and will receive the glorious mission of striking
</p>
<p>down the power of the impious, and scourging with a rod of
</p>
<p>iron the nations inimical to the church, until they be brought
</p>
<p>at length to implore remission of their sins, and pardon for
</p>
<p>their revolt, through the intercession of him whom they
</p>
<p>hear so often blasphemously designated as Antichrist.

<p>Towards the end of this discourse, Father Boothaan seemed to me
</p>
<p>to be deficient in his usual lucidity. There was a want of his accus

<p>XII.
</p>
<p>There is no reason why we should take too desponding
</p>
<p>a view of our position with respect to the Protestant States.
</p>
<p>Trust me, the age will have to pay dear for its much-loved
</p>
<p>liberty. Let us, however, claim our just share in it. That
</p>
<p>many-headed monster named Civil and Political Equality,
</p>
<p>Liberty of the Press, Liberty of Conscience,-  who can
</p>
<p>doubt that its aim, its ultimate aim at least, is the destruc
</p>
<p>tion of the church ? But never shall this proud divinity
</p>
<p>fulfil the vows of its enthusiastic adorers ! Never shall it
</p>
<p>be able to arrest our march ! Firstly, We will strive to
</p>
<p>obtain the same rights as those enjoyed by the Protestants :
</p>
<p>an easy conquest ! We have only to awaken the good
</p>
<p>sense of the Catholics on this point, and to repeat to them
</p>
<p>without intermission : " What tyranny ! Are you not as
</p>
<p>slaves ? Attack their privileges ; overthrow them ! It is
</p>
<p>the will of God !" Secondly, When this equilibrium shall
</p>
<p>have been obtained  since not to go forward is to go
</p>
<p>backward  let us push up the faithful higher and higher,
</p>
<p>over the shoulders, over the heads, of these heretic dogs
</p>
<p>(di questi cani d'eretici). Let us aim at preponderance,
</p>
<p>and in such a manner as to be ever gaining ground in the
</p>
<p>contest. Thirdly, By new efforts, by an irresistible energy,
</p>
<p>the faithful shall at length come forth conquerors, and
</p>
<p>place in their mother's crown that brightest and richest
</p>
<p>gem, Theocracy.
</p>
<p>But what strikes me as most urgent, at the present
</p>
<p>time, is to create a language whose phrases, borrowed from
</p>
<p>Scripture, or from the Bulls, shall convey to the uninitiated

</p>
<p>nothing beyond their ordinary meaning, but which shall
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 133
</p>
<p>contain, for those who are initiated, the principal elements
</p>
<p>of our doctrine. This device is so much the more specious
</p>
<p>as, by its means, we might officially propagate our ideas,
</p>
<p>under the very noses of governments (a la barba de'
</p>
<p>governi), unknown to them, and without the least hindrance.
</p>
<p>Those who are furnished with a key will be able to explain
</p>
<p>this language, on all proper occasions, so as to make known
</p>
<p>the will of Rome. It will generally suffice, for this purpose,
</p>
<p>to lift up a part of the veil with which the church is forced
</p>
<p>to cover herself, to escape much inconvenience in her present
</p>
<p>state of slavery. In this way, each word may be made the
</p>
<p>envelope of a vast political idea.
</p>
<p>It will also be very profitable to our cause if we augment
</p>
<p>the number of those who comprehend us, and if we can
</p>
<p>succeed in enrolling in our ranks the compilers of the briefs
</p>
<p>and decrees which issue from Rome.
</p>
<p>At this moment the father abruptly recurred to his favourite
</p>
<p>thesis. Strike, strike upon this rock : Independence of the
</p>
<p>Catholics in every heretical government ! There is a
</p>
<p>burning thirst for this independence ! and you will see
</p>
<p>what splendid fountains will spring forth from it.
</p>
<p>All Catholic serfs must take those of Ireland for their
</p>
<p>models ; and the manner in which Ireland behaves towards
</p>
<p>her cruel step-mother, England, will teach them what
</p>
<p>conduct to pursue with the Protestant sects and states that
</p>
<p>encompass and overbear them. But I positively declare,
</p>
<p>that we have no chance of success, except by means of
</p>
<p>associations, powerfully combined, which shall have their

<p>organized correspondence, and all sorts of stirring writings.
</p>
<p>For these purposes, it is not enough to have at our disposal
</p>
<p>men of talent and men of action  we must have gold to
</p>
<p>keep them fast to their work. Aye, give me gold  plenty
</p>
<p>of gold ; and then, with such able heads and such resources
</p>
<p>as the church commands, I will undertake not only to
</p>
<p>master the whole world, but to reconstruct it entirely.
</p>
<p>The triumphant tone of his voice was here suddenly checked, and he
</p>
<p>resumed, as if correcting himself.
</p>
<p>When we aim at results so magnificent, a little boldness
</p>
<p>may be allowed us ; but we must not be madly bold.
</p>
<p>Yes, it is just, it is necessary to keep in view that,
</p>
<p>although there be men ready to give their wealth and their
</p>
<p>lives for the deliverance of the church (this word, the
</p>
<p>church, has such a magic influence over their minds!)
</p>
<p>yet nothing would be more dangerous than to explain too
</p>
<p>clearly what the church is, and what it would have. Their
</p>
<p>feeble vision could not bear the full blaze of the mighty
</p>
<p>reality which is hidden under so many folds of the religious
</p>
<p>veil. The moment they discovered the political element
</p>
<p>their arms would sink powerless, their eager zeal would
</p>
<p>vanish, and these athletic combatants, so prompt to serve
</p>
<p>us, would suddenly turn their weapons against us. It is
</p>
<p>by no means rare to witness these sudden changes, when
</p>
<p>persons full of zeal, but at the same time simple and of
</p>
<p>limited views, have been in communication with one of our
</p>
<p>brotherhood, who may have overstepped the bounds of
</p>
<p>prudence. Let us all then carefully fathom the characters

</p>
<p>The experience of some years has also taught me that
</p>
<p>sounding words go much further with vulgar minds than
</p>
<p>the best supported arguments. With well informed and
</p>
<p>cultivated persons we may venture upon abstractions of a
</p>
<p>seductive character, but it will save us trouble to remember
</p>
<p>that the common people may be wrought upon by talk
</p>
<p>which would appear contemptible to men of cultivated
</p>
<p>minds. And now, learn what is the baptism of fire, which,
</p>
<p>at each confession, I used to pour on the heads of my
</p>
<p>penitents in Ireland.
</p>
<p>"Poor people!" I said to them, "how have they
</p>
<p>degraded you ! they esteem you less than brutes. Look at
</p>
<p>these great landlords ! They revel in wealth, they devour
</p>
<p>the land, they laugh at you, and in return for the wealth they
</p>
<p>draw from you they load you with contempt. And yet, if
</p>
<p>you knew how to count up your strength, you are stronger
</p>
<p>than they. Measure yourselves with them, man to man,
</p>
<p>and you will soon see what there is in them. It is nothing
</p>
<p>but your own stupidity that makes them so powerful."
</p>
<p>Such was pretty nearly the substance of all my discourses
</p>
<p>to them. And when their confession was ended, I added,
</p>
<p>" Go your ways and do not be downhearted ; you are
</p>
<p>white doves in comparison with those black and filthy
</p>
<p>crows. Take them out of their luxurious dwellings ; strip
</p>
<p>them of their fine clothes, and you will find that their flesh
</p>

<p>136 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>centuries !  are there to testify for you. But they !  who
</p>
<p>is their father ? One Luther, or Calvin, or a brutal
</p>
<p>Henry VIII. They reckon, at most, three centuries ;
</p>
<p>and these they have dishonoured by numberless crimes, and
</p>
<p>by the blackest of vices ! The Catholics alone are worthy
</p>
<p>to be free ; whilst the heretics, slaves every one of them, of
</p>
<p>Satan, have no rights of any kind. Impious as they are !
</p>
<p>did they not stigmatize as false the religion of their fathers ?
</p>
<p>a religion which counted more than fifteen centuries. In
</p>
<p>other words, they declare all their ancestors damned, and
</p>
<p>believe that they alone are saved."
</p>
<p>Permit me, reverend fathers, to give you a summary of
</p>
<p>the maxims which I have laid down for my own guidance.
</p>
<p>I say to the Catholics who live in mixed countries : 
</p>
<p>" Nothing can be more monstrous than the injustice you
</p>
<p>endure ; you are not heretics, you therefore suffer not only
</p>
<p>your persons but your faith to be enslaved, in being subject
</p>
<p>to the rule of heretic princes. Not only have they no right
</p>
<p>to compel you to this subjection, but God wills that you
</p>
<p>should employ all your efforts to shake off the yoke.
</p>
<p>" To despise the vicar of Jesus Christ is to despise
</p>
<p>your Saviour ; for if Jesus Christ said of the apostles,
</p>
<p>' He who despises them, despises me,' how much greater is
</p>
<p>the crime to despise him for whom Christ especially prayed,
</p>
<p>and whom he himself commissioned to confirm the other
</p>
<p>apostles in the faith.
</p>
<p>" Does it not follow from these declarations, that whilst
</p>
<p>the whole human race is involved in error, the pope alone
</p>
<p>is divinely preserved from all error ?
</p>
<p>" It is from pride alone that heresy persists in main

<p>taining its place beyond the limits of the church. It is
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 137
</p>
<p>not proofs it wants to convince it of its errors ; there are
</p>
<p>proofs more than sufficient to overwhelm it with shame and
</p>
<p>disgrace. " Do you know why it is that Catholicism has not yet
</p>
<p>succeeded in rendering the whole world happy? It is
</p>
<p>because human passions wage perpetual war against it ; it
</p>
<p>is because Catholic kings themselves love their crown better
</p>
<p>than their faith. Be this as it may, it is the pope, and the
</p>
<p>pope only, who, by the will of God, possesses the secret of
</p>
<p>pacifying and uniting all men."
</p>
<p>As regards the Bible, I am quite prepared to maintain
</p>
<p>the happy idea of representing it only as a primitive and
</p>
<p>unfinished sketch ; whence we may justly say that it would
</p>
<p>be folly to expect the church to be now what it was
</p>
<p>originally ; as well might we expect a man to retrograde to
</p>
<p>his cradle. Let us, also, do our utmost to weaken and destroy in
</p>
<p>the minds of the people certain dangerous impressions
</p>
<p>which are apt to be made upon them by the virtues and the
</p>
<p>integrity of the heretics. Let us say to them : 
</p>
<p>" However honest they may appear to you, it is next to
</p>
<p>impossible that their intentions should be pure ; and as to
</p>
<p>their sins, they remain with them, and accumulate fearfully
</p>
<p>on their heads, deprived as they are of those means of
</p>
<p>salvation which the church alone provides, and by which
</p>
<p>alone we can be rendered pure in the sight of God ; whereas
</p>
<p>the Catholics, if unhappily they go on from fault to fault,
</p>
<p>and even become black as coal, will most assuredly be saved.
</p>
<p>Surrounded in their dying hour by every aid and encourage
</p>
<p>ment, they will revive as a flame, provided they do not
</p>
<p>persist to the end (which is scarcely possible) in rejecting

<p>confession, indulgences, and masses, for the redemption of
</p>
<p>their souls ; these are means of grace of which the church,
</p>
<p>our good mother, is liberal towards those who, by their
</p>
<p>devotion and zeal, are worthy to be numbered amongst her
</p>
<p>children." You will easily perceive that, if it is good to exalt, in
</p>
<p>the estimation of Catholics, these precious prerogatives, it
</p>
<p>is well also to draw from them all possible advantage for
</p>
<p>our cause. Thus let us tell them that, if they desire to be
</p>
<p>absolved by the church when on their death-beds, they
</p>
<p>must love her, and do much for her, in order that she
</p>
<p>may do the same for them. Tell them that the only way to
</p>
<p>please her is to hate whom she hates, to be united with
</p>
<p>her, to combat for her, and to raise her from the state of
</p>
<p>humiliation in which the last three centuries have held her.
</p>
<p>Initiated fathers ! Great are the hopes 1 build on the

<p>Let us only be careful to anoint her effectually with our

</p>
<p>slip from his grasp. In how many folds may she not
</p>
<p>entangle the British she-wolf, if she will but listen to our
</p>
<p>counsels ! Rising slowly from the tomb, under the breath
</p>
<p>of resurrection which is already upon her, she will strangle
</p>
<p>in her strong gripe the mysterious vampire which has
</p>
<p>sucked her blood for many a year. What may we not
</p>
<p>make of an idiot, savage, and famishing people ? (d'un

<p>which I am now finishing, in order to present it to our
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 139
</p>
<p>chosen vessel,* that it may serve him daily for a breviary.
</p>
<p>All difficulties are there smoothed, all advantages calcu

<p>lated  the spirit of the nation, its wants, its resources, its
</p>
<p>strength, what excites it, and what encourages it, are there
</p>
<p>laid down and fully reasoned upon.
</p>
<p>The father seemed to have finished, for here he made a pause ; but
</p>
<p>suddenly, with a voice totally changed, in a manner unusually
</p>
<p>deliberate, and with a remarkable stress on each word, he made this
</p>
<p>singular profession of faith : 
</p>
<p>I believe that God looks down with derision upon
</p>
<p>humanity after having abandoned it to all the absurdities
</p>
<p>of its own caprice.
</p>
<p>I believe that morality, principles of conduct, all our
</p>
<p>theories and all our systems, are merely effects of times
</p>
<p>and places, which alone make men what they are.
</p>
<p>Let a nation, or a caste, feel the attraction that lies in
</p>
<p>the prospect of a great and magnificent advantage, let it
</p>
<p>not want the means to ensure itself the possession of this
</p>
<p>advantage, and immediately, in the eyes of this nation or
</p>
<p>caste, justice ceases to wear the same countenance, or to
</p>
<p>prescribe the same code as before in any one phase of its
</p>
<p>existence. Were justice really as unchangeable as books

<p>assure us, she would urge her dictates in vain  she would

<p>not be listened to ; all her remonstrances would be
</p>
<p>despised ; each party, each body, each sect would stick to
</p>
<p>the justice of its own making (alia giustizia di sua inven-
</p>
<p>zione). Such ever has been, and such ever will be man.
</p>
<p>The weak will never cease to be slaves of the strong. Let

<p>us try, therefore, to belong to the latter class ; strong in

<p>Another father then spoke, and though his Italian was correct and
</p>
<p>his accent faultless, it is most probable that he was a German. It is
</p>
<p>well known that in their colleges the Jesuits exercise their pupils in
</p>
<p>making speeches in different languages, so that they often acquire
</p>
<p>great perfection in speech and accent.
</p>
<p>We require to have certain centres from whence our

<p>devoted servants may diverge, both in England and in
</p>
<p>Germany. Bavaria and Ireland naturally present them
</p>
<p>selves as our two strongholds. Who can deprive us of
</p>
<p>them? As to Germany, we must make up our minds to regard
</p>
<p>it as possessing a character altogether peculiar, seeing that
</p>
<p>the Reformation has imbued it with prejudices which seem
</p>
<p>almost insurmountable. We can have no hope that a pure

<p>us go into such and such parts of the country, and endeavour
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 141
</p>
<p>to introduce there our religious practices, beginning by
</p>
<p>such as are least obtrusive, if we see an opening for them ;
</p>
<p>but at the same time, taking care not to expose them to too
</p>
<p>great a number of adversaries.
</p>
<p>There is one argument which I have found singularly
</p>
<p>efficacious in obtaining the concurrence of men in power.
</p>
<p>I have observed to them that Protestantism is a reaction
</p>
<p>of matter against spirit ; for with what did Protestanism
</p>
<p>begin ? With expunging voluntary torture from the
</p>
<p>catalogue of the most heroic and exalted virtues ; whilst,
</p>
<p>without foreseeing the dreadful consequences, it has
</p>
<p>dignified the enjoyment of the most seductive pleasures of
</p>
<p>this life, and thereby produced boundless misehief. " For
</p>
<p>our part (I have thus continued), what we show forth is,
</p>
<p>Christ naked and crucified ; we declare that hunger, thirst,
</p>
<p>privations, scourging, contempt, abandonment, debasement
</p>
<p>even, are so many merits for which Heaven is prodigal of
</p>
<p>rewards. ' Happy those who suffer ! happy those who
</p>
<p>are without consolation here below !' we continually repeat
</p>
<p>to the poor and the wretched ; and if, at confession, they
</p>
<p>complain of the bitterness of their lot, we picture to them
</p>
<p>the Son of God himself without a place wherein to rest
</p>
<p>his head, bearing his cross, crowned with thorns, bleeding
</p>
<p>from the scourge, led to death like a lamb to the slaughter,
</p>
<p>and still forbidding to hate and to curse.
</p>
<p>" Such is the model we place before the common people
</p>
<p>in our sermons and at the confessional, and thus do we
</p>
<p>change them from raging lions into resigned and timid
</p>
<p>sheep. Besides all this we dazzle them by the prodigious
</p>
<p>quantity of Lives of Saints which we set before their

</p>
<p>142 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>resplendent with celestial glory, who have fasted and
</p>
<p>mortified themselves, voluntarily undergoing the most
</p>
<p>severe sufferings, in order to gain a glorious seat in
</p>
<p>heaven. " Weigh all this well, and you will be prepared to ac
</p>
<p>knowledge that the Roman church alone is able to
</p>
<p>guarantee you against the principles of revolt, that by
</p>
<p>such teachings as these it can stifle and destroy them in
</p>
<p>their very germs."
</p>
<p>The speaker here made a slight pause; and then, as if an idea
</p>
<p>suddenly occurred to him, he resumed in a calmer tone.
</p>
<p>What if we organized a special committee to watch
</p>
<p>over the tendencies of the history and literature of the age?
</p>
<p>Encouragement might be adroitly given to any writer who
</p>
<p>would place a few flowers on the bust of one or other of
</p>
<p>our popes, or who might be disposed to defend certain
</p>
<p>parts of our institutions, or our calumniated religious
</p>
<p>practices. In time, we should see a great increase in the
</p>
<p>number of these apologies ; and there is no doubt that if
</p>
<p>a few writers of note were to open the way in this direction,
</p>
<p>others would soon follow in their track, without requiring
</p>
<p>either pay or prompting from us.
</p>
<p>If we could but operate a change in public opinion
</p>
<p>with respect to the history of the church, its dogmas and
</p>
<p>ceremonies, so as to bring the people to regard these things
</p>
<p>with less repugnance, how many obstacles would be thereby
</p>
<p>removed ! We suffer rich benefices to be devoured by a
</p>
<p>host of Sybarites who do us more harm than good why

<p>should we regret a few sums expended for a purpose so

</p>
<p>In the short pauses which took place between the speeches, I
</p>
<p>hastily made a few marks by which I might distinguish the speakers.
</p>
<p>In this place, however, in turning over a leaf, I blotted a line  so that
</p>
<p>I have nothing to say as to the Jesuit who broached the extraordinary
</p>
<p>doctrines which follow.
</p>
<p>As long as the human heart shall remain what it is,

<p>One of my friends had the good fortune to see, at his
</p>
<p>knees, a lady, still young and beautiful. Her husband, an

<p>aged and very rich man, doted on her, and made it his sole
</p>
<p>study to please her. She, on the other hand, was a perfect

<p>specimen of that class of women who love religion  but
</p>
<p>love pleasure no less. Roaming from confessor to con

<p>fessor, she had always had the ill fortune to fall into the

<p>hands of confounded Jansenists. All these had enjoined

<p>her to detach herself from her dear painter ! Our brother,

<p>how to deal with her case. The lady expressed herself

</p>
<p>remain for whole years without receiving the sacraments ;
</p>
<p>my heart would continually tell me that I was a heathen
</p>
<p>and a child of perdition. Was it my fault if they gave me
</p>
<p>in marriage at an age when I was incapable of reflection ?
</p>
<p>He whom I love is the most irreproachable of men ; and
</p>
<p>for myself, this attachment is my only fault. What use to
</p>
<p>me are the good things of life if I must be wretched as
</p>
<p>long as I live ? For the love of the Holy Virgin, reverend
</p>
<p>father ! do not be so hard as my former confessors have
</p>
<p>been ! His pictures* are almost all on religious subjects ;
</p>
<p>there is not a great ceremony in the church at which he is
</p>
<p>not present, as well as myself  too happy, both of us, to
</p>
<p>take a part in these ravishing "solemnities ! Alas ! you
</p>
<p>know not, perhaps, reverend father, what it is to feel such
</p>
<p>love as this!"
</p>
<p>Our friend, after having given free course to this
</p>
<p>torrent of amorous eloquence, gradually soothed his peni
</p>
<p>tent by assuring her that religion is no tyrant over the
</p>
<p>affections  that it demands no sacrifices but such as are
</p>
<p>reasonable and possible. " If you are of opinion," said he,
</p>
<p>" that your health is suffering from the effect of melancholy,
</p>
<p>I can point out to you a way by which you may relieve your

<p>conscience. All those priests who have thus distressed

<p>you understand nothing whatever of matters of faith ; they

</p>
<p>other mild and indulgent. The former positively forbade
</p>
<p>his son the enjoyment of his favourite pursuit ; the latter,
</p>
<p>calling his son to him, thus addressed him :  ' I see, my
</p>
<p>son, that it would cost you much to renounce your favourite
</p>
<p>sport ; meanwhile there is only one condition on which I
</p>
<p>can allow you to indulge it ; namely, that I may have the
</p>
<p>satisfaction of seeing that your affection and zeal for me
</p>
<p>increase in proportion to my indulgence.' What followed ?
</p>
<p>The young man to whom the chase had been forbidden
</p>
<p>followed it in secret, and at the same time became more
</p>
<p>and more estranged from his father, until all intercourse
</p>
<p>was broken off between them ; whilst the other redoubled
</p>
<p>his attentions to his father, and showed him every mark of
</p>
<p>duty and affection."
</p>
<p>You will, no doubt, admire both the parable and the
</p>
<p>tactics of our friend. He thus concluded his address to his
</p>
<p>fair penitent :  " It is for you, madam," said he, " to take
</p>
<p>the latter of these two youths for your model. Be always
</p>
<p>amongst the first at your devotions ; let the house of the
</p>
<p>Lord witness your presence on all holy occasions ; and since
</p>
<p>you are rich, let it be your pleasure to adorn it richly, like
</p>
<p>your own dwelling. The Magdalen, to whom the Lord
</p>
<p>forgave much because she had loved much, proved her love
</p>
<p>by her actions ; she broke the most precious of her vases to
</p>
<p>bedew him with perfumes. In like manner, do you take as
</p>
<p>much interest in the holy spot where Jesus Christ every day
</p>
<p>dwells bodily, as you do in adorning your own person."
</p>
<p>The delight with which the lady heard these words was
</p>
<p>boundless. " Oh, yes, indeed, indeed," cried she, " all
</p>
<p>that you say is clearer than the light of day. I vow that I
</p>
<p>will never again have any other confessor than you."

</p>
<p>It is almost incredible what this lady afterwards lavished
</p>
<p>on the church in ornaments, censers, crowns, and robes
</p>
<p>for the Virgin. She placed herself at the head of different
</p>
<p>confraternities ; and several other ladies, in circumstances
</p>
<p>similar to hers, were easily induced to follow her example.
</p>
<p>Let this serve as a lesson to us. Too much rigour
</p>
<p>dries up the tree ; but indulgence is like the rain which
</p>
<p>nourishes it and makes it bring forth fruit a hundredfold
</p>
<p>(e glifa produrre de' frutti al centuplo).
</p>
<p>Here followed a noisy interruption of some minutes, and it was
</p>
<p>evident that the remarks which were made were rather highly-seasoned.
</p>
<p>I was astonished, and I am still astonished, that men who affect so
</p>
<p>much gravity in public can allow themselves thus to make a jest of
</p>
<p>conscience. The president, however, soon put a stop to these ebul
</p>
<p>litions of gaiety, remarking that he was led by what he had just heard
</p>
<p>to communicate a perfectly novel idea. This idea, which he was about
</p>

<p>the subject of celibacy, and the calamities which its renouncement

<p>I have to remark, that Father Fortis, if it were indeed he who

<p>presided at this conference, and Father Boothaan, his actual successor

<p>in the generalship of the Company, seemed to take a livelier interest than

</p>
<p>well know that if ever a breach is opened on this side, if ever
</p>
<p>a considerable portion of the clergy (urged on by the secular
</p>
<p>power which might be interested in such a change) should
</p>
<p>demand the right to marry, the whole hierarchical edifice
</p>
<p>would crumble away stone by stone, until nothing remained
</p>
<p>of the church. If once this question came to be generally
</p>
<p>entertained, the dispute would grow hot, and everybody
</p>
<p>would be asking, "When did ecclesiastical celibacy begin?"
</p>
<p>Its history would be investigated ; and the marble covering
</p>
<p>which has been lying for ages over its mysteries, would be
</p>
<p>wholly removed. Scruples, remorse, and reaction, would
</p>
<p>spring up and spread like an epidemic. Rome would
</p>
<p>resist most certainly, for the very foundations of Catholicism
</p>
<p>would be in danger ; but a growing irritation would every
</p>
<p>where find some object to fasten upon  inquiry would
</p>
<p>proceed to other matters besides celibacy  and in all
</p>
<p>probability a formidable league would be formed which
</p>
<p>would address this question to the pope : " Where are your
</p>
<p>titles to command the church and the clergy ?" Thus there
</p>
<p>would be revolt upon revolt, and the' Holy See, beset on all
</p>
<p>sides, would have to sustain the sorest fight it had ever
</p>
<p>waged. It is therefore highly expedient that we should connect
</p>
<p>with the celibacy of the clergy as many interests as possible,
</p>
<p>like so many spokes of a wheel round its axis. For I
</p>
<p>repeat to you, brethren, if this institution should come to
</p>
<p>be overthrown, where is the dogma that will long survive
</p>
<p>it ? As, in a house of cards, the fall of one single card is
</p>
<p>followed by that of the whole construction, so, should

<p>celibacy fall to the ground, down will fall confession, mass,

</p>
<p>glory will depart from our priesthood; and the mines
</p>
<p>from which we have drawn such rich supplies, will be
</p>
<p>henceforth closed to us. Maintain celibacy, and our course
</p>
<p>will be one uninterrupted triumph ; suffer it to fall, and
</p>
<p>what a destiny will be ours ! We shall be, as it were, trans
</p>
<p>fixed with wounds, shamefully mutilated, our every project
</p>
<p>torn to pieces in our hands ! Quod absit ! we must, how
</p>
<p>ever, expect all this, if, by some powerful measure, we
</p>
<p>do not prevent so great a calamity.*
</p>
<p>Since we are occupied in forging so many revelations
</p>
<p>and miracles, would it not be possible (great things proceed
</p>
<p>sometimes from small beginnings) to compose a little work
</p>
<p>which should breathe the purest perfume of sanctity, and
</p>
<p>which should at first be cautiously and secretly circulated ?
</p>
<p>It might be conceived in some such terms as these : 
</p>
<p>" The Church is entering upon dangerous times. Upon
</p>
<p>its fall, or its consolidation, hinges the end or the continuance
</p>
<p>of the world. An era of glory yet unheard of will open for
</p>
<p>the clergy, if it will lend an ear to what God reveals to it by
</p>
<p>Saint  " (this revelation must be made in the name of
</p>
<p>some saint of recent date). " The strength which the
</p>
<p>clergy will derive from it is immense. It will teach them
</p>
<p>supernatural secrets, to throw down heresy, and to build
</p>
<p>up the degraded priesthood on the ruins of the profane,
</p>
<p>bestowing on it, at last, its imprescriptible title of royal.
</p>
<p>It is Jesus Christ himself who establishes this new compact
</p>
<p>* Others have thus expressed the same fears. " The duration of
</p>
<p>the Catholic confession," says Archbishop de Pradt, " depends upon
</p>
<p>the celibacy of its priests ; let the one fall, and the other perishes with
</p>
<p>it. It would be an act of suicide in the Church of Bome to give up

</p>
<p>with the shepherds of his flock, in order to prepare them,
</p>
<p>as valiant and invincible soldiers, for the struggle which
</p>
<p>is near. In former times, the Almighty sanctified
</p>
<p>simultaneous and visible polygamy. This was in order to
</p>
<p>people the earth ; it was meet that all other considerations
</p>
<p>should yield to this. In later times, God condescended to
</p>
<p>permit this state of things to continue, even when the earth
</p>
<p>was covered with multitudes of people. Now, that the time
</p>
<p>seems to have arrived to render the church the universal
</p>
<p>sovereign, and to give it a glorious triumph over all its
</p>
<p>enemies  now, the Almighty, who does what he wills, in
</p>
<p>heaven and on earth, without control or question, from any
</p>
<p>power human or divine, abolishes for the clergy, for all
</p>
<p>monks, and all nuns, of whatsoever denomination, real and
</p>
<p>true celibacy, and for this reason, that it cannot but be
</p>
<p>hurtful to those who, called to destroy the armies of Satan,
</p>
<p>require for the success of this work to be as closely and as
</p>
<p>intimately united as if they were but one soul and one
</p>
<p>body. Wherefore God establishes, henceforward, instead
</p>
<p>of the ancient continence, a successive and invisible poly
</p>
<p>gamy (una poligamia successiva e invisibile), and he requires
</p>
<p>only an interior and spiritual celibacy. But so precious a
</p>
<p>concession is only made in favour of those who resolutely
</p>
<p>undertake the task of labouring for the re-estabhshment of
</p>
<p>the church, and who spare no sacrifice in order that she
</p>
<p>may be adorned and glorified as becomes the spouse of
</p>
<p>God, and that she may finally take up her stand above all
</p>
<p>principalities, dignities, and powers, so that, all things
</p>
<p>may be put under her feet : seeing that there is nothing,

<p>belonging to Jesus Christ, which is not equally due to the

<p>" It hence follows that the right to have a sister* after
</p>
<p>the manner of Saint Paul (for the title of wife belongs only
</p>
<p>to those who are externally and indissolubly married)  it
</p>
<p>follows, I say, that this right can only be granted to those
</p>
<p>labourers whose zeal in the holy cause is constant and
</p>
<p>heroic. It would be, in fact, a monstrous injustice, if these
</p>
<p>men might not enjoy so dear a privilege with an untroubled
</p>
<p>conscience. But it is, at the same time, highly important
</p>
<p>that all those against whom the church has any cause of
</p>
<p>complaint, should be impressed with the conviction that
</p>
<p>they could not usurp this privilege without committing
</p>
<p>deadly sin.

<p>given to those who are actively engaged in the Lord's

</p>
<p>sun, was a prophecy of the mysterious contract which God
</p>
<p>has reserved for our times."
</p>
<p>I have been for some months absorbed in this new and
</p>
<p>important theme ; I am therefore prepared to enter upon
</p>
<p>its development with all the seriousness it merits.
</p>
<p>To open such a view as this to the church hierarchy,
</p>
<p>would fortify, as by a triple wall of brass, a point of
</p>
<p>Catholicism so really weak, and so frequently attacked. I
</p>
<p>have not the least doubt that our idea will gain ground if
</p>
<p>* The text is here perverted; here it is verbatim: "Have we not
</p>
<p>power to take about with us a sister-wife, as do the other apostles, the
</p>
<p>brethren of our Lord, and Cephas?" (1 Cor. ix., 5.) Brother and
</p>
<p>sister were synonymous with Christian ; as to the word wife, Pope
</p>
<p>Leo IX. himself acknowledges that it here signifies a married woman.

</p>
<p>we can manage to form a sect, at first very secret and select,
</p>
<p>which should adroitly insinuate this good news into convents
</p>
<p>and nunneries, and into the heads of certain churchmen.
</p>
<p>Some resistance there will be of course, but finally all will
</p>
<p>agree upon the propriety of what is at once so agreeable
</p>
<p>and so advantageous in many ways. You well know, besides,
</p>
<p>that we have nothing to invent in this matter, since numer
</p>
<p>ous connections of the nature we would advocate are already
</p>
<p>in existence. But as they exist at present, they bring no
</p>
<p>profit to the church ; on the contrary, they are hurtful,
</p>
<p>inasmuch as they bring many a conscience into trouble ;
</p>
<p>whereas the authorization that I would give them, would
</p>
<p>take away all remorse, and would provoke an increase of
</p>
<p>zeal and industry. By virtue of this plan, men and women
</p>
<p>would co-operate to one end, each at his or her post,
</p>
<p>according to the established rules ; whilst, thanks to this
</p>
<p>metamorphosis, the only scruple which could disturb them
</p>
<p>would be the fear of not rendering themselves worthy of
</p>
<p>such a privilege by a sufficiently entire devotion to the church.
</p>
<p>If you will now consider the certain results of this
</p>
<p>secret dogma, you will find them of immense importance.
</p>
<p>But the most consummate prudence will be required in
</p>
<p>guiding and propagating the plan in question. The hospi
</p>
<p>tals a la Saint-Roch* must be multiplied, and monks and
</p>
<p>nuns of all kinds must learn to combine three indispensable
</p>
<p>qualities,  first, outward austerity ; second, moderation
</p>
<p>in their pleasures, and the most intimate mutual agree
</p>
<p>ment ; third, an indefatigable zeal for the conquest of

<p>souls  a zeal which never says, " It is enough."

<p>You know the proverb, Varietas delectat. This presents
</p>
<p>a further guarantee of the immense fruitfulness and of the
</p>
<p>solidity of such a theory ; especially if, having vanquished
</p>
<p>all opposition, it should one day obtain an altar in the

<p>hierarchical sanctuary. Let it once obtain one, and no
</p>
<p>power on earth can ever remove it from that seat.*

<p>The Jesuit, whose revelations on the most delicate of subjects the
</p>
<p>reader is about to peruse, and who, further on, gives others not less
</p>
<p>curious, touching the dignitaries of Bome, had, in all probability,
</p>
<p>long resided in that city, with which he appears to be intimately
</p>
<p>acquainted. All that I have just heard is perfectly true. And, in
</p>
<p>order to convince yourselves that, even in this respect, we
</p>
<p>have abundant materials ; that, in point of fact, we have
</p>
<p>nothing to do but to legalize, or, more properly speaking,
</p>
<p>to consecrate what already exists pretty nearly everywhere,
</p>
<p>I beg of you to fix your attention on what I have to suggest
</p>
<p>to you. * Cardinal Bellarmin, a Jesuit, was the first to promulgate the
</p>
<p>germ of this audacious idea respecting celibacy. He says : " For
</p>
<p>those who have made a vow of continence, it is a greater crime to
</p>
<p>marry than to give themselves up to incontinence." (Bellarmin, De
</p>
<p>Monachis, lib. ii., cap. 30.) Innocent III. (Extra, de Bigamia,
</p>
<p>cap. 34) says the same thing. Saint Paul says, on the contrary,
</p>
<p>" Honorabile connubium in omnibus ; Marriage is honourable in all."
</p>
<p>(Heb. xiii. 4.) "Melius est nubere quam uri : It is better to marry
</p>
<p>than to burn." (1 Cor. vii.) The apostle excepts no one, and admits

<p>of no prescription.
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 153
</p>
<p>No doubt you are all more or less acquainted with the
</p>
<p>things of which I am about to speak, but perhaps some of
</p>
<p>you are ignorant of certain particulars.
</p>
<p>I refer to the Sisters of Charity; charming women, who
</p>
<p>owe it to us not to forget that " well-ordered charity begins
</p>
<p>at home." I have visited and been intimate with many of
</p>
<p>them in different countries. They are very accessible and
</p>
<p>very confiding ; almost all whom I have known have
</p>
<p>spoken to me of their secret sorrows. I have listened to
</p>
<p>their complaints against priests and_ monks,  as if they
</p>
<p>expected our hearts to be as tender and as ardent as their
</p>
<p>own ! It is my opinion that these are the sort of nuns
</p>
<p>adapted to our own times. I wish, indeed, it were possible
</p>
<p>to lighten the yoke of all the rest (allegerire il giogo dell'
</p>
<p>altre), who are condemned unnecessarily and uselessly to
</p>
<p>see nothing all their lives but one little patch of sky and
</p>
<p>one little patch of earth ; and what is still worse, to remain
</p>
<p>always shut up together, seeing the same eternal faces,
</p>
<p>without any possibility of removing to another convent,
</p>
<p>even when such a change appears reasonable. I would
</p>
<p>have the cloister abolished altogether, so that there might
</p>
<p>be less difficulty, less ceremony in approaching them.
</p>
<p>What a spring of cheerfulness for the poor hearts of these
</p>
<p>maidens ! What an opportunity for them to vary, if not
</p>
<p>their pleasures, at least their griefs !* The Sisters of
</p>
<p>Charity have this advantage.
</p>
<p>* There was more prudence in the fifth century. Pope Leo the
</p>
<p>Great made a decree, cited in the Boman Breviary, a decree with
</p>
<p>which few persons are acquainted, and which will surprise many : 
</p>
<p>" He decreed," says the Breviary, " that no nun should take the veil
</p>
<p>until she had given proof of her chastity during forty years. Sanxit

</p>
<p>You know that good professors, skilful in this kind of
</p>
<p>chase, capture these poor little creatures when they are in
</p>
<p>the depths of terror and anguish. It is when they find
</p>
<p>themselves betrayed and forsaken, when the ground seems
</p>
<p>to fail from beneath their feet, and shame and remorse
</p>
<p>overwhelm them, that they eagerly accept the proposal to
</p>
<p>become Sisters of Charity. Young, for the most part, and
</p>
<p>having long deluded themselves with dreams of blissful
</p>
<p>love, they fall. at last into despair. But their eyes are
</p>
<p>soon opened to the nature of the new state upon which they
</p>
<p>have entered ; beset by priests of every age they soon
</p>
<p>forget their fine resolutions. They are as yet but at the
</p>
<p>very entrance of their spiritual career, and already their
</p>
<p>fortitude is shaken by the temptations of the flesh. As
</p>
<p>they find a sort of pleasure in dwelling upon the misfortunes
</p>
<p>which have decided them to become nuns, they have
</p>
<p>scarcely finished pouring their romantic tale into the curious
</p>
<p>ears of priests or monks ere they have already laid the
</p>
<p>groundwork of another. This time, however, they feel
</p>
<p>certain, the character of their new friends considered, that
</p>
<p>the web they are weaving will be of golden tissue.* If the
</p>
<p>clergy were discreet they would not make a capital object
</p>
<p>of a pleasure which they ought to take lightly as a passing
</p>
<p>indulgence. Always joining the utile with the dulce they
</p>
<p>should, however, profit by these critical moments to incite
</p>
<p>the woman to acts from which the church may indirectly
</p>
<p>derive advantage ; for women can far outdo us when love
</p>
<p>and religion have warmed their imaginations. It is our

<p>business to know how to feed this double flame. Our best

</p>
<p>plan would be to impress upon our sisters that, where
</p>
<p>there is a want of constancy on our part, it is a chastisement
</p>
<p>for their want of zeal. Mountains alone are unchangeable.
</p>
<p>We should, moreover, never form anew connection without
</p>
<p>an express condition, on the part of the newly elected one,
</p>
<p>that she shall perform prodigies. But it happens, alas ! too
</p>
<p>often, that men to whose lot they fall show no consideration
</p>
<p>for these frail vessels, and unexpected consequences expose
</p>
<p>them to inconveniences of the same nature as those which
</p>
<p>induced them to take refuge under the religious garb.
</p>
<p>But wise precautions may keep all scandal at bay ; a sum
</p>
<p>of money, a temporary abandonment of the dress of their
</p>
<p>order, and a prompt obedience in removing to some other
</p>
<p>place, will always prevent affairs of this sort from transpiring.
</p>
<p>In their new residence they will be sure to find some new
</p>
<p>sister who will aid and console them ; for where is there one
</p>
<p>who has not been, or who may not be exposed to the same
</p>
<p>difficulties ?
</p>
<p>Here an interruption took place. I heard the voice of the president,
</p>
<p>and then a confusion of voices. There seemed to be a sort of calling
</p>
<p>to the question. The orator continued in these terms : 
</p>
<p>The essential point to which I would draw your
</p>
<p>attention is this. We must labour to multiply in all places
</p>
<p>initiated confessors, who may be able not only to augment
</p>
<p>the number of these sisters by persuasion and argument,
</p>
<p>but who may adroitly take advantage of their critical
</p>
<p>position, in cases such as those which I had first to mention
</p>
<p>to you. In fact, when they return to their religious duties,

<p>experienced priests, who, in proving to them the vanity of
</p>
<p>all human things, may totally change their ideas, and urge
</p>
<p>them, by the aid of severe penitence and heroic labours, to
</p>
<p>acquire unheard-of merits. At this period, also, the perusal
</p>
<p>of the life of some female saint, who has been a model of
</p>
<p>holy enthusiasm, who has been eager to incur suffering,
</p>
<p>and loss, and ruin, in order to serve her fellow-creatures,
</p>
<p>will have a wonderful effect.
</p>
<p>There are in our strangely complicated existence moments
</p>
<p>which pass fruitlessly away, for want of being seized oppor
</p>
<p>tunely. I remember with what cheerfulness and ardour I
</p>
<p>devoted myself, whilst yet a novice, to the most disgusting
</p>
<p>functions of the hospitals. I confess that I should now be
</p>
<p>utterly incapable of these acts of self-denial ; but it is not
</p>
<p>less true that, such as I then was, I rendered myself useful
</p>
<p>to the Company. I contributed my part to thicken the
</p>
<p>layer of good which can never be too deep to cover * 
</p>
<p>that which a blinded world  incapable of appreciating the
</p>
<p>grandeur of our work  always stigmatize as  bad !
</p>
<p>I have beheld these our sisters in their field of action,
</p>
<p>devoting themselves with assiduous care to the relief of the
</p>
<p>most infamous galley slaves, and this in places and scenes
</p>
<p>so repugnant as to astonish the proudest heretics and the
</p>
<p>coldest infidels. And I, who knew so deeply and so well
</p>
<p>the subtle springs which move these delicate creatures, I
</p>
<p>have felt something stirring in the bottom of my heart at
</p>
<p>the sight of their constancy and their courage.
</p>
<p>* To cover  much evil. This is the word which naturally suggests
</p>
<p>itself. In order to avoid it, and yet feeling himself, bound to finish
</p>
<p>the sentence, the Jesuit lengthened out word after word, andhis circum

<p>OF THE JESUITS. 157
</p>
<p>The secret of all these things is this :
</p>
<p>In order to induce them to prolong such sacrifices, to
</p>
<p>persuade others to imitate them, and to determine them if
</p>
<p>they waver, we must take the opportunity, when no strange
</p>
<p>ears are within hearing, and particularly at confession, to
</p>
<p>dwell upon such ideas as these :  " It is true that you
</p>
<p>have a hard struggle to overcome all that is most repugnant
</p>
<p>to your nature ; but the angels, who behold you, envy you
</p>
<p>your future crowns in heaven. Persevere, for if even
</p>
<p>weakness, or even crime, has stained your consciences, from
</p>
<p>the day that you entered here, your charity, like fire, has
</p>
<p>wholly purified you. Henceforward you are white as
</p>
<p>snow ; Jesus Christ looks upon you as his well-beloved
</p>
<p>spouses ; he calls you his doves, his perfected ones ; and
</p>
<p>the oil which you daily burn in your lamps is so abundant
</p>
<p>that it can never fail you. If we judge of you by your
</p>
<p>exterior, what so feeble as your frames ! if we look within,
</p>
<p>what is there to be compared with the strength of your
</p>
<p>spirit ! If it were not for your sakes, avenging thunderbolts
</p>
<p>would fall upon the earth ! But God takes pleasure in you ;
</p>
<p>you are the dearest objects of his love ; he looks upon you
</p>
<p>and he becomes disarmed. Oh ! beware how you cut short
</p>
<p>a time so precious ; remain at your post of honour, where
</p>
<p>the heretics look upon you with stupefaction, avowing that
</p>
<p>they have never beheld such devotedness in their own
</p>
<p>impious sect. Pursue, then, your heroic career ; for when
</p>
<p>you shall have accomplished your generous martyrdom, you
</p>
<p>will find yourselves in possession of such a treasure of merits,
</p>
<p>that you will be for ever lifted above the frailties and the
</p>
<p>faults which are, in this life, but too inevitable."

<p>It is easy to imagine what power this species of eloquence

<p>158 SECRET PLAN
</p>
<p>gives us over the better part of that sex which is not less
</p>
<p>complex in character, nor less enigmatical than ourselves,
</p>
<p>but generally more credulous. When they have once tasted
</p>
<p>the nectar of these flattering eulogiums, some of the most
</p>
<p>ardent and impressionable amongst these women may be
</p>
<p>brought to plunge into the intoxication of mysticism, and
</p>
<p>by a strange miracle to transform the vague mobility of
</p>
<p>their minds into something fixed and constant ; we may
</p>
<p>convert them into beings destined to remain altogether
</p>
<p>inexplicable to those who are ignorant of our secrets ; beings
</p>
<p>who are, in fact, medals of honour which Catholicism can
</p>
<p>place, with pride and exultation, before the eyes of its
</p>
<p>silenced and confused enemies.
</p>
<p>If we can extract fire from two bits of wood, rubbed
</p>
<p>together, what may we not obtain from these women,
</p>
<p>assembled together, and placed entirely and exclusively in
</p>
<p>our hands ? Why should we not furnish ourselves with
</p>
<p>such a chosen band, worthy to be sent on missions of
</p>
<p>importance, and to become, by the very charm and illusion
</p>
<p>of their presence, a centre of attraction and a means of
</p>
<p>conquest ?
</p>
<p>This subject would admit of amplification ; but, not to
</p>
<p>lose time in digression, I will return to considerations more
</p>
<p>immediately involved in the subject. Every one will admit
</p>
<p>that the example we owe to the public, our common
</p>
<p>interest, our complicity, and the fear of laical observation,
</p>
<p>must necessarily force us to cover these connections with
</p>
<p>the most impenetrable mystery. But whence comes it
</p>
<p>that there have always been relations of this sort ever since
</p>
<p>priests, monks, and nuns have existed ? It is that, in the

</p>
<p>even these are desirous of providing themselves in these
</p>
<p>female nursery-grounds with- some adjutorium simile sibi,
</p>
<p>being well satisfied, all the while, to live apart from the
</p>
<p>world. Now, it is a fact that the arms which they
</p>
<p>employ to vanquish these interesting creatures are precisely
</p>
<p>the same as those which we would ourselves consecrate to
</p>
<p>the purpose. Their only means in fact of making them
</p>
<p>yield is to say to them : " Provided that your fall is com
</p>
<p>pensated by charity, by devotion and prayers, by an active
</p>
<p>observance of all religious rites,  in a word, provided that
</p>
<p>the good counterbalances the evil, especially when this evil,
</p>
<p>which does harm to no one, is caused by an unavoidable
</p>
<p>necessity ; then, thanks to the quantity of indulgences
</p>
<p>amassed, and to the intermediation of saints, whose favour
</p>
<p>may be propitiated ; thanks, also, to many other merits,
</p>
<p>daily augmented by scrupulous care and pious practices,
</p>
<p>the part of sin becomes deadened, or as it were annulled,
</p>
<p>whilst the part of good works remains entire and abundant."
</p>
<p>It is then clear as the day that our system, at least in
</p>
<p>its rudimentary form, has long been at work in the habits
</p>
<p>and in the hearts even of the clergy, of monks and of nuns ;
</p>
<p>all we have to do is to make it complete by gradually con
</p>
<p>secrating it ; just as when an artist has completed a statue,
</p>
<p>it is brought forth from his profane studio, and solemnly
</p>
<p>inaugurated. XVII.

<p>but we must not flatter ourselves that we shall easily bring

<p>160 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>our short-sighted clergy to accept ideas so bold. I know
</p>
<p>thousands who would be delighted to put our theory
</p>
<p>into practice as far as they themselves are concerned, but
</p>
<p>who would reject the principle as impious. I admit that
</p>
<p>if we could induce them to enter intrepidly into this
</p>
<p>course (as to the women, they are easily managed  they
</p>
<p>never have any other will than that of their spiritual
</p>
<p>directors), we cannot calculate the immense benefit which
</p>
<p>would follow for the church. Meanwhile, let me warn you
</p>
<p>that we should be utterly lost if so grave a secret should
</p>
<p>ever, by any chance, publicly transpire. Let us, then, act
</p>
<p>invariably in this matter with the most consummate pru
</p>
<p>dence. If we can but continue to hold together our
</p>
<p>religious bodies by those strong bonds, the pleasing cogency
</p>
<p>of which experience has fully demonstrated, what have we
</p>
<p>to fear for celibacy ? It cannot perish ; and as long as it
</p>
<p>keeps its ground, what Catholic institution or dogma can
</p>
<p>incur any danger ?
</p>
<p>That naturally leads me to speak, according to the
</p>
<p>indication of the programme. (Velenco), of the radical reform
</p>
<p>of the episcopacy, the cardinalship, and the papacy, as the
</p>
<p>last term of our efforts ; a reform without which it will be
</p>
<p>impossible to maintain many others which ought to extend
</p>
<p>to the heart of all communities and all convents.
</p>
<p>Since there ought to be but one model for the whole
</p>
<p>church, should' not the superior clergy feel themselves
</p>
<p>peculiarly bound to give us their aid in engraving it on
</p>
<p>every heart? But is it probable that we shall inspire
</p>
<p>this body with any magnanimous resolutions ? Can it

<p>comprehend us ? Verily, verily, the columns of the

</p>
<p>them, and you will perceive their want of massiveness.
</p>
<p>They are hollow, and at the first shock  it would need no
</p>
<p>very strong one  the whole edifice would give way. What
</p>
<p>shall we then do to prop them up until we shall have
</p>
<p>gradually substituted for them a stronger range of sup
</p>
<p>porters ? In other words, how shall we organize a totally
</p>
<p>new plan for the election of such as are fit to sustain us ?
</p>
<p>How shall we introduce into the whole church a rule and
</p>
<p>a set of maxims better conceived, more rational ; so that
</p>
<p>dignities, riches, and honours, all, in a word, that is worthy
</p>
<p>of man's ambition, shall become so many recompenses for
</p>
<p>eminent services rendered to our cause all over the world ?
</p>
<p>If we could realize a species of alliance between talent,
</p>
<p>ambition, and the most exciting interests on the one hand,
</p>
<p>and the interests of our system on the other, then, indeed,
</p>
<p>our progress would become triumphant ! We must conse
</p>
<p>quently choose for our purpose, not men of a narrow and
</p>
<p>pedantic morality, which is always at war with our great
</p>
<p>projects, but the most advanced of our own initiated
</p>
<p>members, who shall have furnished, by their admission
</p>
<p>into our mysterious laboratory, some new links to the
</p>
<p>chain of our creative conceptions.
</p>
<p>It is, therefore, expedient that a great number of the
</p>
<p>superior clergy, and some of the cardinals, should begin to
</p>
<p>be acquainted with our ideas, in order that they may feed
</p>
<p>upon them. This would be a means of preparing materials
</p>
<p>for the desired change. It is certain that if we could
</p>
<p>henceforward reckon upon men worthy of the name, whose
</p>
<p>number should be daily augmenting, whether by reciprocal

<p>contact, or by the promotion of such as are able to compre

</p>
<p>when I find it so utterly incapable of anything great,
</p>
<p>the rage that I feel is not so much against it, as against
</p>
<p>that college of cardinals, from which nothing issues but
</p>
<p>what is totally unworthy both of the purple it wears,
</p>
<p>and of the lofty station it occupies. In fact, I see
</p>
<p>amongst them all, high and low, nothing but a collection
</p>
<p>of blockheads, who sit there and grow fat (che imbecilli,
</p>
<p>che s'impiguano). It is true that their tongues now and
</p>
<p>then curse the age which sometimes disturbs their volup
</p>
<p>tuous slumbers ; but who amongst them ever takes the
</p>
<p>trouble to think for a moment, or to consult those who do
</p>
<p>think, on the means of extinguishing the conflagration that
</p>
<p>is devouring all around ?
</p>
<p>We alone, my brethren, we alone bear the burden of
</p>
<p>the summer heat ; we alone, diving deep into the annals of
</p>
<p>the world, study the secret springs which have decided the

<p>fate of empires ; and our hope and courage gain strength

<p>from this study.
</p>
<p>Permit me now to offer you a wholesome advice. Let

<p>our individuality become effaced. Let us be, as much as
</p>
<p>possible, not men but ideas. It is these which sooner or

<p>later get possession of crowns. Let these b^ assiduously

<p>said, there are a few honourable exceptions. When we

<p>shall once have gained even a few of those who are the
</p>
<p>most hostile to our views, there will ere long be beheld

</p>
<p>1 64 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>I am sure we shall all admit the necessity of involving
</p>
<p>the people in the thickest and most inextricable network of
</p>
<p>devotional practices, so that they may become docile in pro
</p>
<p>portion to their stupidity. But all this, though not without its
</p>
<p>value, is not yet enough ; what is of all things indispensable
</p>
<p>is, an active, indefatigable, perpetual concurrence, like this
</p>
<p>which now animates us collectively ; men of large and bold
</p>
<p>intellects, intent on Continually advancing the progress of
</p>
<p>our work. Unless the church have the aid of a vast brain
</p>
<p>to elaborate for it a truly Catholic scheme, can it expect
</p>
<p>ever to see mankind universally subject to one sole chief ?
</p>
<p>This is the way in which the name of Rome, at present
</p>
<p>so light, will recover all its preponderance.
</p>
<p>As for persons of high birth, I would show them no
</p>
<p>favour, except in cases where their position or influence might
</p>
<p>contribute to the more rapid advancement of our conquests.
</p>
<p>From the moment I beheld heretical governments stretch
</p>
<p>forth a hand to aid in the re-establishment of the Holy
</p>
<p>See, I believed the time was coming when they would at
</p>
<p>last swallow the bait, and begin to Catholicize their states ;
</p>
<p>but it is only too evident that I was deceived. Nevertheless,
</p>
<p>a few years ago some Roman princes having accompanied
</p>
<p>a prince of Germany on a visit to our most celebrated
</p>
<p>monuments, upon his asking for some explanations on a
</p>
<p>historical subject, there was something said about certain
</p>
<p>ferocious beasts being tamed by their masters to such a
</p>
<p>degree that the said masters did not fear to place their
</p>
<p>heads within the animals' mouths. I observed to these
</p>
<p>personages that a narcotic powder, frequently employed,
</p>
<p>would probably produce these marvellous effects. As this

</p>
<p>remark was accompanied with a somewhat subtle smile,
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 165
</p>
<p>the heretic prince understood me, and replied, "Reverend
</p>
<p>father, have you not some narcotic powder for all those
</p>
<p>wild beasts?"  pointing to the passing crowds  "for they
</p>
<p>seem to me very far from being tame." Emboldened by
</p>
<p>this observation I answered, " From the moment your
</p>
<p>populations were delivered from the Catholic soporifics, and
</p>
<p>you yourselves broke so many salutary checks upon them,
</p>
<p>from that moment they have been as turbulent as madmen.
</p>
<p>It is just as if the narcotics given to those animals were to
</p>
<p>be discontinued for a while ; their astonishing tameness,
</p>
<p>which attracts such crowds of curious observers, would then
</p>
<p>be at an end, and they would resume all their habitual
</p>
<p>ferocity." This led us on to further discussion, and I have
</p>
<p>reason to believe that the prince went away convinced of
</p>
<p>the efficacy of our remedies to cure this very inconvenient
</p>
<p>popular malady.
</p>
<p>But in order that hints of this kind may have more
</p>
<p>considerable results, we require a greater number of
</p>
<p>instruments. I return, then, to the necessity of having
</p>
<p>some of ours initiated in the cloisters, and of getting rid
</p>
<p>of some of these cardinals without thought, these popes
</p>
<p>without capacity, and of a host of bishops without nerve or
</p>
<p>energy, and who are totally ignorant of the spirit of the
</p>
<p>age. For our plan will be nothing but a dream until
</p>
<p>we can actually bring about these changes. Before the
</p>
<p>hierarchy can exercise any imposing influence, it must have
</p>
<p>in its upper ranks men of power to conceive, and of energy
</p>
<p>to bring their conceptions into action ; men who are capable
</p>
<p>of reducing other men under the power of a vast and
</p>
<p>unfathomable political wisdom. Who would then dare to

</p>
<p>166 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>I ask you  is there anything approaching to this in the
</p>
<p>men whose office it is to guide us ? Fools that they are !
</p>
<p>They would have us look upon them as giants ! Man's whole
</p>
<p>strength is in his intellect ; but these pillars of the church
</p>
<p>have nothing strong about them but their animal tempera
</p>
<p>ment. What would be the fate of these rotten voluptuaries,
</p>
<p>these ignoramuses, buried in purple and in ennui (di questi
</p>
<p>voluttuosi putridi, di questi ignari sepolti nella porpora e nella
</p>
<p>noia), but for our unconquerable energy and intrepidity ?
</p>
<p>We have, then, a herculean task to accomplish : to
</p>
<p>renovate a triple sphere, as well as the chief who governs it ;
</p>
<p>and when a considerable mass shall have undergone a
</p>
<p>complete transformation, it is then that a pope who shall
</p>
<p>bear within him our idea, already ripened and developed,
</p>
<p>may employ the means and resources which shall have
</p>
<p>been accumulated by our strenuous exertions during a
</p>
<p>century, perhaps, or more. Again he may launch forth his
</p>
<p>anathemas, his interdictions, and his omnipotent decrees, to
</p>
<p>shake thrones, and to humble for ever the pride and
</p>
<p>insolence of monarchs.
</p>
<p>After these last words there was a sort of pause ; and during this
</p>
<p>interval several remarked upon what they had heard as presenting
</p>
<p>insurmountable difficulties. I even remarked a general tone of doubt
</p>
<p>and discouragement. Some, however, asserted that in time all this

<p>might be effected. In order to animate them after this short colloquy,

</p>
<p>I would not have any one despair of the great future
</p>
<p>success of our enterprise because our beginnings are small.
</p>
<p>What could be more inconsiderable in appearance than was
</p>
<p>our Company at its commencement ? Yet but a few years
</p>
<p>had, elapsed ere it proved to be full of vigour, and was
</p>
<p>already become rich and powerful. And, in later times,
</p>
<p>what throne but owned the mysterious ascendency of our
</p>
<p>This short reflection was made in a familiar tone ; it 'was a brief
</p>
<p>reply to those who had expressed some doubt as to the final triumph
</p>
<p>which was promised. Then, as though prompted by the picture just
</p>
<p>given of the vices of the Boman hierarchy, or, perhaps, previously
</p>
<p>prepared for this subject, he resumed after a short pause, in a voice
</p>
<p>alternately impassioned, proud, or exalted, but always marked by self-
</p>
<p>possession. In his manner of dealing with this subject he displayed
</p>
<p>surprising tact, profundity, and boldness.
</p>
<p>From the review which has been taken of the matter,
</p>
<p>you must perceive that the church, notwithstanding the
</p>
<p>immense aggregate and the value of its materials, is far
</p>
<p>from being in the condition of an edifice solidly raised upon
</p>

<p>escaped an overthrow on the first shock, let us look to the

<p>causes of its weakness. It wanted a skilful and rigorous

</p>
<p>to strengthen the most exposed parts ; and would have seen
</p>
<p>that the whole was united together by the strongest and
</p>
<p>most tenacious cement. The greatest amongst the popes
</p>
<p>themselves have never possessed a clear and living light,
</p>
<p>they have only groped in the dark ; and this explains to us
</p>
<p>wherefore a work, which is in itself gigantic, presents so
</p>
<p>little homogeneousness and harmony.
</p>
<p>If, when the barbarian hordes overran our country
</p>
<p>and took possession of it ; when the Roman empire fell to
</p>
<p>pieces, and Christianity was driven to change its abstract
</p>
<p>form for one better adapted to fascinate the imaginations
</p>
<p>and the senses of the new comers ; if, at the moment when
</p>
<p>the papacy arose out of the universal degradation, it had
</p>
<p>fallen into the hands of men of large and enterprising views,
</p>
<p>it would have been able in times so propitious to efface,
</p>
<p>secretly and by degrees, all records of the ancient state of
</p>
<p>things, and to blot out every trace of the transformation of
</p>
<p>the episcopal aristocracy into a papal monarchy. It might
</p>
<p>have effected this by retrenchments from and additions to
</p>
<p>the writings of councils and of fathers, employing on this
</p>
<p>task minds capable of accomplishing it ; and then, what
</p>
<p>a glorious position for us ! The great strife between
</p>
<p>Catholicism and Protestantism would never have arisen, or
</p>
<p>at least it would wholly have confined itself to the authen
</p>
<p>ticity of the primitive writings.
</p>
<p>This work of retrenchment and addition ought to have
</p>
<p>been confided to a Roman school, well trained to the pur
</p>

</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 169
</p>
<p>Here a few taps at the outer door, which I distinctly heard,
</p>
<p>stopped my pen. The thought that some one was perhaps seeking me
</p>
<p>froze me with terror, and drove every other thought out of my head.
</p>
<p>I did not recover from my alarm until I was aware that the person who
</p>
<p>had gone to the door to reply had quietly returned to his seat. There
</p>
<p>was probably too a momentary suspension of the proceedings ; for not
</p>
<p>withstanding the mist in which I was wrapped for a while, it does not
</p>
<p>strike me that there is any sensible lacuna in my report of the speech.
</p>
<p>What was wanting in the ninth century was a pope
</p>
<p>who should have eclipsed the glory of Charlemagne.
</p>
<p>Gregory VII. with his gigantic, but too vague ideas;
</p>
<p>Innocent III. with his marvellous institutions, confession,
</p>
<p>inquisition, and monks, came too late. Five centuries
</p>
<p>earlier, some genius equal to his, and ourselves to aid with
</p>
<p>the vast idea that now engrosses us, would have rendered
</p>
<p>the Romish church the sovereign arbiter of the whole
</p>
<p>world. Instead of this, the two centuries which preceded
</p>
<p>Hildebrand supplied popes madder than Caligula, and
</p>
<p>more monstrous than Nero, so that it is impossible for us
</p>
<p>to give a colour to their history which may be deemed  1
</p>
<p>will not say excusable, but even tolerable. Neither the
</p>
<p>fourteenth rior tbe fifteenth century offers a single example
</p>
<p>of talent and intelligence capable of foreseeing, and con
</p>
<p>sequently of preventing by the abolition of the most flagrant
</p>
<p>abuses in the church, the horrible outbreak of the sixteenth
</p>
<p>century. What, in fact, do we see in the two centuries
</p>
<p>which precede Protestantism ? The Roman see occupied
</p>
<p>either by men of less than ordinary abilities, or by haughty
</p>
<p>voluptuaries. Such beings ruin a construction rather than
</p>
<p>help to build it up. They have no prudence to guide them ;
</p>
<p>they exhibit to the people in their own persons a spectacle

</p>
<p>of turpitude, as if the people were brutes, absolutely
</p>
<p>170 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>incapable of reflection. Under such popes, with a clergy,
</p>
<p>bishops, and monastic orders of the same stamp, was it to
</p>
<p>be hoped that the church should wax great and strong so
</p>
<p>as to hold nations and monarchs compressed in its great
</p>
<p>embrace ? Can we be surprised that it still remains in a
</p>
<p>state of abortion in spite of its immense resources ?
</p>
<p>Dropping his voice to a confidential whisper, he continued :
</p>
<p>It is my desire that among ourselves everything be
</p>
<p>spoken out, and that the whole naked truth be uttered ;
</p>
<p>for it is in the highest degree useful and necessary to us to
</p>
<p>know and to study it, as it is.
</p>
<p>Besuming then his former manner, and even with added emphasis,
</p>
<p>he continued :
</p>
<p>Are we so blind as not to perceive clearly that whatever
</p>
<p>was done then was done entirely with greedy and interested
</p>
<p>views, and that the same observation applies also to the
</p>
<p>present times ? Nothing has ever been contrived as subordi
</p>
<p>nate to the execution of a vast plan. You are acquainted
</p>
<p>with the infamous abuses of nepotism, and its frightful
</p>
<p>consequences : what a degradation of the papacy ! That
</p>
<p>high and inestimable dignity was no longer coveted but as
</p>
<p>a means of glutting the mad ambition and insatiable avarice
</p>
<p>of a few families. Meanwhile, a vast catastrophe was
</p>
<p>impending, and the veil of the temple was about to be rent
</p>
<p>in twain. Alas ! when those selfish dreamers suddenly
</p>
<p>awoke and everywhere lighted exterminating fires for
</p>
<p>heretics, it was too late. Men's eyes were opened, they
</p>
<p>had learnt to think, their indignation was aroused, the fire
</p>
<p>of it was in their hearts. The death of a great number

</p>
<p>of heretics only bestowed on a party already strong and
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 171
</p>
<p>filled with the most perverse ideas, the dangerous prestige
</p>
<p>of possessing its martyrs. Thus, by an excess of impru
</p>
<p>dence on our part, heresy took its stand as a power, to
</p>
<p>which novelty and persecution gave attraction and strength.
</p>
<p>How much time was thus lost ; and what conflicts was the
</p>
<p>church compelled to sustain, no longer for the purpose of
</p>
<p>extending her sway, but simply to save herself from imminent
</p>
<p>and utter ruin.
</p>
<p>Leo X.  that Sardanapalus enervated by Asiatic
</p>
<p>luxury  did nothing but blunder. Those who succeeded
</p>
<p>him followed but too closely in his footsteps. At length,
</p>
<p>the hurricane had almost dispersed the riven planks of the
</p>
<p>Bark, and no one could suggest any practical expedient for
</p>
<p>keeping them together. All grew pale at the demand for
</p>
<p>an oecumenical council, and it is certain that that of Trent
</p>
<p>would have been the grave of Rome but for the ability of
</p>
<p>our Company. We, resolute and unswerving, succeeded in
</p>
<p>baffling the multitude of heretics who were eager to attack
</p>
<p>the very foundations of Catholicism. With History in their
</p>
<p>hand, they were prepared to question the Bible, the Fathers,
</p>
<p>the Councils, to trace them from age to age, and explore
</p>
<p>the origin of each institution, dogma, and practice. What
</p>
<p>secrets would then have come to light ! The symbol of
</p>
<p>the ancient faith, the primitive mode of solving questions,
</p>
<p>the progress of the papal power, the precise date of every
</p>
<p>innovation and change, the immense chaos of past ages, so
</p>
<p>well covered until then, would all have been exposed to the
</p>
<p>eye of day. Sifted after this fashion, nothing would have
</p>
<p>been preserved but what is expressly supported by some
</p>
<p>text of Scripture ; the rest would have been remorselessly

</p>
<p>burnt as stubble. Nor could the pope have flattered
</p>
<p>172 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>himself with the hope of remaining an honoured patriarch ;
</p>
<p>this very title of patriarch, they would have told him, was
</p>
<p>but of recent invention. There was a general conspiracy
</p>
<p>against it, bent on reducing it to the measure of what it
</p>
<p>was when many bishops of the east and even of the west
</p>
<p>despised it so openly, and when Cyprian, Ireneus, and
</p>
<p>Polycarp held it in so little esteem.
</p>
<p>How many bishops, indeed, flocked to Trent with hostile
</p>
<p>intentions ! How far might not their boldness have pro
</p>
<p>ceeded, had heresy been permitted to spread freely before
</p>
<p>them its pernicious erudition ? But we intrepidly defended
</p>
<p>the breach, and the young hydra strove in vain to break
</p>
<p>into the place.
</p>
<p>Thus, after three centuries of indefatigable labour, after
</p>
<p>we had been as a cuirass on the breast of Rome, her
</p>
<p>enemies determined to tear us thence, and almost succeeded,
</p>
<p>convinced that as long as we remained, Rome was invulner
</p>
<p>able. But if Rome, in her weakness, bent for a time like
</p>
<p>a palm-tree beneath the raging winds, she soon raised her
</p>
<p>head again ; and now, let us trust, she has gained an
</p>
<p>accession of strength that will enable her for the future to
</p>
<p>defy storm and thunder. Kings call upon us  they feel
</p>
<p>the need of our narcotic cup for their people ; but they
</p>
<p>shall drink of it themselves also, and deeply ! We will not,
</p>
<p>however, forget to bedew its rim with honey.
</p>
<p>The cadence of these last words made me imagine that the confer
</p>
<p>ence was closed, when I heard the same chief resume, but with the
</p>
<p>coolness of a man who recapitulates. His repetition of ideas already
</p>
<p>propounded, was doubtless intended to give more prominence to certain
</p>
<p>favourite views which, as the reader has seen, predominated during

</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 173
</p>
<p>Two principles  amongst the many we possess  two
</p>
<p>principles of. inexhaustible power and attractiveness ought
</p>
<p>to hold the first place in our consideration ; and this we
</p>
<p>must continually call to mind.
</p>
<p>We must thus argue with men in power, and especially
</p>
<p>those at court :  Heresy having been the cause of all the
</p>
<p>complications which arose precisely when church and state
</p>
<p>were on the point of entering into a happy alliance, the
</p>
<p>results of which could not but have been solid and most
</p>
<p>satisfactory, it is of the highest importance that we should
</p>
<p>at length realize what three centuries of anarchy have
</p>
<p>postponed. As soon, then, as positive conclusions shall
</p>
<p>have been laid down, the following should be the two
</p>
<p>leading principles of a new code, devised for the regulation
</p>
<p>and conservation of the vast interests of the two powers at
</p>
<p>length united : 
</p>
<p>Whenever heresy shall dare to disturb the
</p>
<p>sacred tranftuillity of the church, whatever may
</p>
<p>be the nature of its assaults, be they slight or
</p>
<p>serious, the duty of the state shall be to punish
</p>
<p>them with the utmost rigour, as political crimes.
</p>
<p>Reciprocally, Whenever revolt shall dare to
</p>
<p>disturb the sacred tranquillity of the state, what
</p>
<p>ever may be the nature of its attacks, be they
</p>
<p>slight or serious, the duty of the church shall
</p>
<p>be to stigmatize them in the face of the nations,
</p>
<p>and to treat them with the same rigour as heresy
</p>
<p>itself, which is to be crushed by terrible and
</p>
<p>solemn chastisements.
</p>
<p>After this, we have only to be logically consistent, and
</p>
<p>since it is a maxim of the schools that qui potest majus

</p>
<p>potest minus, it will not be difficult to contrive that the
</p>
<p>spiritual power, the omnipotent divinity of the Holy See,
</p>
<p>shall entirely absorb the temporal power. Only let them
</p>
<p>give up to us the souls of the people, let kings second us
</p>
<p>with their encouragement and their wealth, and our hierarchy,
</p>
<p>at present winding about like a river, shall soon spread wide
</p>
<p>as the sea, and cover hills and mountains.
</p>
<p>But it is mainly important that we should know how to
</p>
<p>extinguish, one by one, the multitude of phosphoric flames
</p>
<p>that glitter in every direction. We must have the art to
</p>
<p>accustom the mass of the people to look up to none but our
</p>
<p>men (sic); and thus we shall train them for the day when,
</p>
<p>excited by some crying injustice, an increase of taxes, or
</p>
<p>some such cause of discontent, they shall furnish us with an
</p>
<p>opportunity to hurl forth a thundering manifesto from Rome,
</p>
<p>a signal of its rupture with all governments, and conse
</p>
<p>quently of a decisive and final struggle, in which we shall
</p>
<p>be bravely supported by the innumerable and ardent host
</p>
<p>which we or our successors shall have so well disciplined.
</p>
<p>Would that we might be certain  but at least we can
</p>
<p>hope  that when that crisis comes, a considerable portion
</p>
<p>of the hierachy will have undergone a radical and complete
</p>
<p>change ; that the loftiest thrones of the sanctuary will be
</p>
<p>inaccessible to men incapable of understanding us ; that
</p>
<p>bishops and cardinals well know how to follow up their
</p>
<p>brave words with braver deeds ; and finally, that, after
</p>
<p>so many sacrifices, we may have to glory in a man
</p>
<p>embodying, in his own person, the most enterprising
</p>
<p>popes of past times, a man wearing one of those heads, in

</p>
<p>The artisan, when plying his ordinary labour, is never
</p>
<p>discouraged by the hardness of the wood or the metal on
</p>
<p>which he works, because he has at hand such implements
</p>
<p>as will reduce these materials into whatever forms he pleases.
</p>
<p>Let us so take care to be well provided with implements.
</p>
<p>When the ebullition which we are secretly fomenting shall
</p>
<p>have reached a sufficient point, the cover shall be suddenly
</p>
<p>removed, and we will pour our liquid fire upon those politi
</p>
<p>cal meddlers, who are ignorant and unreflecting enough to
</p>
<p>serve as tools in our hands, and our efforts will result in a
</p>
<p>revolution, worthy of the name, which shall combine in one
</p>
<p>universal conquest all the conquests that have yet been made.
</p>
<p>For this purpose, let our unceasing exertions be directed
</p>
<p>to the conversion of souls, and let us so preach that death
</p>
<p>beds may be the fruitful source of donations, riches, jewels,
</p>
<p>and all sorts of legacies. Means of action are indispensable
</p>
<p>to us, and these means must be as vast as our projects.
</p>
<p>Let nothing resist us ; whilst, enveloped in mystery from
</p>
<p>head to foot, we ourselves remain impenetrable.
</p>
<p>Friends, we must conquer or die ! The higher classes are
</p>
<p>always very inaccessible to the lower ones ; let us nourish
</p>
<p>their mutual antipathy. Let us accustom the mob, which
</p>
<p>is, in fact, an implement of power, to look upon us as its
</p>
<p>warmest advocates ; favouring its desires, let us feed the
</p>
<p>fire of its wrath, and open to its view a golden age ; and let
</p>
<p>the pope, Rome, Catholicism, or the Church, let each of
</p>
<p>these words become for the people the expression of all its
</p>
<p>rights, the point on which its eye is fixed, the object of its

<p>devotion, the moving spring of its thoughts and intentions.

</p>
<p>to marvellous effects, and that those who believed themselves

<p>wise, were fools.
</p>
<p>Yes, brethren ! we also are kings ! our arsenal is perhaps
</p>
<p>as rich as theirs, and even, if I mistake not, more efficient.
</p>
<p>Our chaplets, our medals, our miracles, our saints, our holy-
</p>
<p>days, in fine, all that immense battery which we have this
</p>
<p>day passed in review, (*) will be worth as much, I imagine,
</p>
<p>as their powder, their soldiers, their cannon, and their
</p>
<p>moving forests of bayonets. All depends upon the skill
</p>
<p>with which we combine this infinity of means, discipline our
</p>
<p>troops, and by exciting their zeal and their courage, pre
</p>
<p>pare them for the day which must bring to nothing, or
</p>
<p>crown with triumph, the long series of our labours. Let
</p>
<p>them make a jest of our processions round the profane
</p>
<p>Jericho, let them mock us and the sound of our trumpets,
</p>
<p>provided that at the seventh circuit, and assuredly it will be
</p>
<p>made, the walls of the city fall down, and those who inhabit
</p>
<p>it fall a prey to us.
</p>
<p>What we have to do, then, is to erect again upon its
</p>
<p>pedestal the prostrate papal colossus. We engineers, here
</p>
<p>assembled, have to concert a special plan for this pur
</p>
<p>pose, to point out the machines to be used or to invent new
</p>
<p>ones, to form workmen and place in their hands levers and
</p>
<p>cables, and then, provided the whole be directed by superior
</p>
<p>intelligence, success will be infallible.
</p>
<p>Such is our task.

<p>* Ch'oggi abbiamo si bene analixxato ; this expression induces me
</p>
<p>to suppose that the analysis of all these things had been made, the

</p>
<p>But the day is closing, and I desire that we may not quit
</p>
<p>this place before some one, who may have considered the
</p>
<p>subject more deeply than myself, shall have said a few words
</p>
<p>on the possibly sinister issue of events, which, seeing the
</p>
<p>dangers around us, it is indispensable that we should coolly
</p>
<p>consider, while as yet our minds are undisturbed by any
</p>
<p>immediate apprehensions of such a result.

<p>XX.
</p>
<p>There ensued a brief silence, which the Irishman was the first to
</p>
<p>break, though in a tone less confident than before. He soon warmed,
</p>
<p>however, and became quite himself again.
</p>
<p>If I venture to respond to this appeal, it is because I
</p>
<p>was lately present at a meeting of our fathers, in which the
</p>
<p>subject now in question was amply discussed. The con
</p>
<p>ference closed with the following resolution.
</p>
<p>Should we ever (it was unanimously agreed) be aban
</p>
<p>doned by kings, or should any fatal discovery utterly ruin
</p>
<p>our projects ; should we in vain attempt to recover, if not
</p>
<p>confidence, at least some standing compatible with the
</p>
<p>execution of our plan ; should we even be forced to crawl
</p>
<p>along (trascinarci) for a lengthened period, in order to
</p>
<p>reunite our many lost or broken threads  even in this
</p>
<p>extremity, happen what may, we must resign ourselves to
</p>
<p>these shackles, and submit to this wearisome delay. But if
</p>
<p>nothing can reconcile us with the offended Catholic govern

<p>safety in a mean and narrow sphere, consent to immolate us

<p>kings and Rome that, even under circumstances so adverse,

<p>strength, we will take vengeance on them in a manner
</p>
<p>equally sudden and terrible. In six months Rome would

<p>Assuredly Catholicism and its ceremonies would be for

<p>later evaporate, and we should but have hastened the

<p>labouring to introduce. What matters it ! let our last cry

<p>of despair, let our death be worthy of us ! We must not be

<p>content to disappear like a dried-up river ; let us rather
</p>
<p>resemble a torrent which breaks every mound and bears
</p>
<p>down every obstacle ; like the elements of nature, which

<p>cannot be compressed without bursting out into universal

<p>they would vanish from the earth along with us. Such

<p>would be the vengeance of Samson when shorn, blinded,

</p>
<p>the analysis of each separate question or problem should
</p>
<p>present a character as deliberate and cool as that of the
</p>
<p>synthesis ought to be warm and enthusiastic. I admire
</p>
<p>these two different kinds of talent, but I have rarely seen
</p>
<p>them united in the same individual. I have almost always
</p>
<p>found that those who were eloquent in the one way were
</p>
<p>mute in the other, and vice versa. Let us strive to combine
</p>
<p>the calmness of reason with the fire of enthusiasm. Christ,
</p>
<p>who saw the germ of so many splendid truths, teaches us
</p>
<p>that in order " to make ourselves master of the strong man,
</p>
<p>his house and his goods, we must first bind him." Let us,
</p>
<p>therefore, become perfect in the art of loading the proud
</p>
<p>and the powerful with chains. Let us lay to heart this
</p>
<p>maxim as the rule of all our efforts :  one sole authority 
</p>
<p>that of Rome ; one sole order  that of the Jesuits. And
</p>
<p>since our age does not boast a single mind capable of
</p>
<p>aspiring to universal empire, for kings have enough to do
</p>
<p>to retain a hold upon their petty kingdoms which are slipping
</p>
<p>from their grasp, let it be ours to aim thus high, whilst
</p>
<p>empty heads are dreaming. Nulla dies sine lined. Let
</p>
<p>not any opportunity escape us of observing what are men's
</p>
<p>tendencies ; the better we know them the more useful they
</p>
<p>will be as instruments in our hands. Let us, at all events,
</p>
<p>so conduct ourselves that our future glory may compensate
</p>
<p>for our present abasement ; for whether our name be
</p>
<p>destined to perish, or finally to prevail over kings and
</p>
<p>nations, let it, at least, be synonymous with the loftiest

<p>reach of greatness and daring which the world has ever

</p>
<p>PAET III.
</p>
<p>PROOFS AND CONCLUSION.
</p>
<p>I.
</p>
<p>The Jesuits have always spoken of themselves in terms of
</p>
<p>the most unmeasured pride.
</p>
<p>When their society had reached the hundredth year of its
</p>
<p>existence, they composed a book in its honour. The
</p>
<p>symbols which decorate the frontispiece of this work
</p>
<p>sufficiently prove that they esteem the humblest member
</p>
<p>of their order as infinitely above the rest of mankind.
</p>
<p>They call themselves "The Company of the Perfect."*
</p>
<p>The contents of the volume accord with the arrogance of
</p>
<p>its emblems. The Jewish high-priest wore on his breast the jewel
</p>
<p>called the oracle. The order of the Jesuits considers itself,
</p>
<p>under the New Alliance, as the oracle from whence the
</p>
<p>pope draws his inspiration.
</p>
<p>They proclaim themselves "the masters of the world,
</p>
<p>the most learned of mortal men, the doctors of the nations,
</p>
<p>the Apollos, the Alexanders of theology, prophets descended
</p>
<p>from heaven, who deliver the oracles in the cecumenic

</p>
<p>184 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>The epitaph which they composed for Loyola strikingly
</p>
<p>exhibits their love of grandiloquence, and their overween
</p>
<p>ing pride. It runs thus : 
</p>
<p>" Whoever thou art who conceivest in thy mind the
</p>
<p>image of Pompey the Great, of Caesar, and of Alexander,
</p>
<p>open thine eyes to the truth, and thou wilt learn from this
</p>
<p>marble that Ignatius was the greatest of conquerors."
</p>
<p>The epitaph of Saint Francis Xavier is in the same
</p>
<p>strain. But how striking the contrast between their conduct
</p>
<p>and the apotheosis they award themselves ! We could say
</p>
<p>nothing on this subject which has not been proved by
</p>
<p>numberless publications.
</p>
<p>Some of their own generals, even, have made no secret
</p>
<p>of their dismay at the perverse tendencies of the order.
</p>
<p>Mucio Vitelleschi, the sixth general, in one of his letters,
</p>
<p>dated the 15th of November, 1639, cannot refrain from
</p>
<p>pointing out the loathsome malady that had fastened upon
</p>
<p>the Company. "There exists," he says, "amongst the
</p>
<p>superiors of our society an excessive cupidity which spreads
</p>
<p>from them through the whole body. From this source
</p>
<p>comes the indulgence which they manifest for those who
</p>
<p>bring them riches."
</p>
<p>Saint Francis Borgia, one of the earliest generals of the
</p>
<p>order, had before this acknowledged that poison was in its
</p>
<p>veins. I will not here repeat the numerous testimonies
</p>
<p>which prove that their casuistry justified crime in all its
</p>
<p>forms. It is impossible to deny that the doctrines, every
</p>
<p>where to be found in their writings, authorize theft, rape,
</p>
<p>perjury, debauchery, and even murder ; that, when they

</p>
<p>have judged it expedient to get rid of a king, they have
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 185
</p>
<p>not shrunk from making the apology of regicide. But
</p>
<p>what we should be most repugnant to believe, did not their
</p>
<p>books, approved by the generals of the order, attest it, is
</p>
<p>the cynical nature of their science on a matter which ought
</p>
<p>to remain unknown to religious men, vowed to perpetual
</p>
<p>chastity, and making pretensions to perfect purity.
</p>
<p>I shall not enlarge upon this subject, but confine
</p>
<p>myself to quoting a judgment which conveys the impression
</p>
<p>made on grave doctors of the church by the perusal of some
</p>
<p>of the books of the Holy Company. The university of
</p>
<p>Paris, in 1643, in its Verites Academiques (Academical
</p>
<p>Truths), thus expresses itself:
</p>
<p>"All that the malice of hell can conceive of most
</p>
<p>horrible ; things unknown even to the most depraved of
</p>
<p>pagans, all the abominations which could call up a blush
</p>
<p>on the face of effrontery itself, are epitomised in the book of
</p>
<p>a Jesuit. The different casuists of this society teach secrets
</p>
<p>of impurity unknown even to the most dissolute."
</p>
<p>What must be the shamelessness in their secret
</p>
<p>assemblies, if they suffer it to become thus apparent in
</p>
<p>their printed works ? There is the less likelihood of their
</p>
<p>amendment, inasmuch as whilst others are led astray by
</p>
<p>passion and temptation, their immorality is a system,
</p>
<p>founded on an utter contempt of what is right and just.
</p>
<p>It is painful and revolting to make these assertions,
</p>
<p>but the truth must be told. A pope supports it with his
</p>
<p>authority. In 1692, Clement VIII. presided at a general
</p>
<p>chapter of the Jesuits ; what is the reproach which he casts
</p>
<p>upon them ? His words reveal the spirit, the tactics, and
</p>
<p>the whole plan of the Jesuits, ancient and modern.*

</p>
<p>" Curiosity," said this pope, "induces them to intrude
</p>
<p>everywhere, and principally into the confessionals, that
</p>
<p>they may learn, from their penitent, all that passes in his
</p>
<p>home, among the children, the domestics, and the other
</p>
<p>inmates or frequenters of the house, and even all that is
</p>
<p>going on in the neighbourhood. If they confess a
</p>
<p>prince, they contrive to govern his whole family ; they
</p>
<p>seek even to govern his states, by inspiring him with the
</p>
<p>belief that nothing will go well without their oversight and
</p>
<p>care." The assertion of Clement VIII. , made in terms so precise,
</p>
<p>would be sufficient to command belief; but there are
</p>
<p>numerous and striking historical facts, which prove
</p>
<p>that, under pretence of religion, this Company has
</p>
<p>constantly carried on a plot against nations and their
</p>
<p>governments. I will mention one only of all these facts, but it was so
</p>
<p>notorious in its time, and is one of such weight, that it is as
</p>
<p>good as a thousand. It is related as follows by President
</p>
<p>de Thou, an historian of acknowledged probity :  *
</p>
<p>" The Jesuits were accused, before the senate of Venice,
</p>
<p>of having pried into family secrets, by means of confession ;
</p>
<p>and of having come, by the same means, to know intimately
</p>
<p>all sorts of particulars relating to individuals, and, con
</p>
<p>sequently, the designs and resources of the state ; and of
</p>
<p>having kept registers of these things, which they forwarded,
</p>
<p>every six months, to their general, by the hands of their
</p>
<p>visitors. Proofs of these charges were found in many

</p>
<p>This fact is not denied by Sachin himself, one of the
</p>
<p>most devoted historians of the Company.*
</p>
<p>II.
</p>
<p>This is surely enough to make those writers pause who
</p>
<p>have undertaken the defence of the Jesuits, and have
</p>
<p>carried it so far as to assert that they do not concern
</p>
<p>themselves about temporal things, and that the whole
</p>
<p>world is in a conspiracy to calumniate them. As if the
</p>
<p>universities, parHaments, and bishops who have accused
</p>
<p>them of corrupting morals, and leading the people astray,
</p>
<p>could have leagued themselves together, from age to age,
</p>
<p>for a purpose so iniquitous. Strange it is, however, we
</p>
<p>repeat, that, in our times, they have again succeeded in
</p>
<p>gaining over the bishops, that the more the world shudders
</p>
<p>at their name, and abhors them, the more warmly the
</p>
<p>superior clergy espouses their cause, and identifies itself
</p>
<p>with them. There is now a concert of apologies in their
</p>
<p>behalf. The new Catholic school is strenuous for them,
</p>
<p>alleging even that it is the very excess of their virtue which
</p>
<p>has called down so much hatred upon them, and that this
</p>
<p>hatred can only proceed from the envious rage of the
</p>
<p>impious. M. Laurent, bishop of Luxembourg, says in
</p>
<p>a pastoral letter of 1845 : 
</p>
<p>" God has sent to the aid of his church militant a well

<p>name is Ignatius de Loyola. Anathema against all the
</p>
<p>sovereigns of Europe, who, guided by an infernal instinct,
</p>
<p>and by the instigation of some self-styled philosophers,
</p>
<p>constrained the court of Rome to suspend for a time this
</p>
<p>holy order of Ignatius the Great."
</p>
<p>In France, of late years, the superior clregy has
</p>
<p>disseminated many books on the subject of free teaching.
</p>
<p>Its organs are full of fine-sounding orations in favour of
</p>
<p>the common right. Nothing can be more curious than
</p>
<p>their expressions on this subject. They are constantly
</p>
<p>borrowing the language which they used formerly to
</p>
<p>stigmatize as subversive of the throne and of the altar.
</p>
<p>It is true that they were then in the insolence of pros
</p>
<p>perity, and that their position is since changed. Become
</p>
<p>feeble themselves, they are compelled to have recourse to
</p>
<p>the arms of the feeble.
</p>
<p>But are they hearty and sincere in all that they proclaim
</p>
<p>so loudly about right and truth ? They have put on the
</p>
<p>new man too hastily for us to suppose that they have
</p>
<p>entirely put off the old. Thus, the Bishop of Luxembourg
</p>
<p>would have all instruction superintended by the clergy, and
</p>
<p>dependent upon it. The Univers, the organ of the French
</p>
<p>bishops, holds the same views.*
</p>
<p>" Since the university has been at work it has only
</p>
<p>produced incapable and corrupt schoolmasters, and irre
</p>
<p>ligious and impious doctors. The Bishop of Perpignan,
</p>
<p>following the example of M. de Bonald, demands free
</p>
<p>teaching. ' My wishes,' he says, ' are in favour of free
</p>
<p>competition in the instruction of youth ; but I believe that

</p>
<p>this precious instruction has indispensable need of super
</p>
<p>intendence. Laws, and imperative laws, are necessary to
</p>
<p>protect society against the dangers of bad doctrines. This
</p>
<p>superintendence ought to combine all the elements capable
</p>
<p>of rendering it complete and enlightened ; and consequently
</p>
<p>the episcopacy must not remain a stranger to it. In fact,
</p>
<p>religion has a large share in the inculcation of the sciences,
</p>
<p>of which it is the foundation, and the episcopacy
</p>
<p>alone is a competent judge in this matter, since it alone has
</p>
<p>been established guardian of the sacred deposit of the
</p>
<p>faith. Now, has not its bearing on this point been turned
</p>
<p>aside ?"
</p>
<p>All the art which the defenders of the clergy employ
</p>
<p>in their writings, is compressed into these few lines ; the
</p>
<p>writer first proclaims right and justice, and declares
</p>
<p>himself the champion of free competition ; then he asks for
</p>
<p>imperative laws against the dangers of bad doctrines. And
</p>
<p>who are to judge of these dangers ? The bishops. They
</p>
<p>alone are competent judges of every range of ideas ; the
</p>
<p>sciences are not to advance beyond the limits they shall
</p>
<p>prescribe. It appears, then, that in their estimation free
</p>
<p>instruction and common right signify subjection of thought
</p>
<p>and conscience to episcopal censure and domination.

<p>" Wherefore," cries the Bishop of Chalons,* " should

<p>there be two sorts of instruction in one house ? If it
</p>
<p>is yours which ought to have the precedence, why not

<p>tell us so ? Wherefore compel us to play a part in your

<p>that these persons profess the same religion as the pope.

<p>It is true that the catechism says the contrary, but the
</p>
<p>catechism makes a mistake ; the bishops say the contrary,
</p>
<p>but the bishops know nothing of the matter. Oh but 
</p>
<p>Make no objections : the king having heard the council of
</p>
<p>state, orders you to be convinced."
</p>
<p>Are we to believe, then, only what the pope decrees,
</p>
<p>after having heard the council of cardinals ? If it be so,
</p>
<p>the following is to be our creed :  " The doctrines of civil
</p>
<p>and political equality are seditious ; we cannot hold in too
</p>
<p>much horror liberty of opinion and of the press, and
</p>
<p>particularly this maxim, that every man ought to enjoy
</p>
<p>liberty of conscience ;" for such are the very words of
</p>
<p>Gregory XVI., in his circular of the 15th of August,
</p>
<p>1832. A French bishop has made himself the interpreter of
</p>
<p>the spirit of the Vatican under the preceding pope.
</p>
<p>Different religious journals in Italy have applauded his
</p>
<p>attacks against those innovators who follow up " the mad
</p>
<p>and impious project of a restoration or regeneration of
</p>
<p>humanity." The Bishop of Carcassonne declared, in a
</p>
<p>mandate which followed close upon the circular of which
</p>
<p>we have just spoken:  "If it (the Romish church) so
</p>
<p>requires, let us sacrifice to it our opinions, our knowledge,
</p>
<p>our intelligence, the splendid dreams of our imaginations,
</p>
<p>and the most sublime attainments of the human
</p>
<p>understanding. Far from us be all that bears ihe stamp
</p>
<p>of novelty." In the primitive ages, the Christian doctors held
</p>
<p>another language. Tertullian, speaking in the name of
</p>
<p>the church, thus expresses himself :  *

<p>The superior clergy has begun to boast of being alone
</p>
<p>able to realize liberty and right. We have just seen what

<p>it understands by free teaching. There is, after all, no
</p>
<p>secret to discover. The Bishop of Liege declares openly :

<p>" We desire the monopoly of religious and moral instruc

<p>tion, because to us belongs the divine mission of bestowing
</p>
<p>it." *
</p>
<p>Is it not grievous and scandalous to find so many
</p>
<p>artifices amongst those on whom Jesus especially enjoined
</p>
<p>simplicity and truth ? Their minds have unhappily become
</p>
<p>perverted by the habit they have contracted of anatomizing
</p>
<p>vices and crimes ; a mass of perfidious subtleties has at
</p>
<p>length stifled the voice of conscience within them. From
</p>
<p>hence proceeds their willingness to temporize when interest

<p>prompts them ; from hence their inconceivable versatility,
</p>
<p>and their tactics ever changing according to times and
</p>
<p>places, alternately cursing or blessing, the doctrines of
</p>
<p>liberty one day, and those of absolutism on the morrow.
</p>
<p>But it is important to remark that whilst their means are
</p>
<p>perpetually changing, their end is always the same. When
</p>
<p>power is adverse to them, or does not favour them as they

<p>could wish, they do not shrink from the revolutionary

<p>so odious. Thus, whilst they declare it to be the rigorous
</p>
<p>duty of those who suffer, to submit to their lot without a

</p>
<p>by propounding ideas which they will afterwards reprobate,
</p>
<p>when they have no longer an interest in sustaining them.
</p>
<p>I will give one example of this, one example amongst
</p>
<p>thousands which prove that what I advance is well founded.
</p>
<p>On the 21st of May, 1845, at Paris, in the aristocratic
</p>
<p>church of St. Roch, the Abbe le Dreuille thus exclaimed : 
</p>
<p>" I am the priest of the people. Labourers do not
</p>
<p>enjoy the rights to which they have a claim ; it is time for
</p>
<p>the rich and the powerful to render them an account. Is it
</p>
<p>necessary to tell them that the working-man has a torch in
</p>
<p>his hand which a single spark will suffice to light, and that
</p>
<p>he will presently carry it flaming into chateaux and palaces
</p>
<p>with cries of distress and of vengeance ? Has not experience
</p>
<p>taught us, that privileges authorized by the law are liable to
</p>
<p>fall before the justice of the people?"
</p>
<p>The same abbe, whom we believe to be sincerely liberal
</p>
<p>and a friend to the people, once again preached the same
</p>
<p>doctrine in the same church. He had been authorized to
</p>
<p>do so. And since there has never been any repetition of the
</p>
<p>same thing, is it not reasonable to suppose that the desired
</p>
<p>effect had been produced ?

</p>
<p>more cherished friends than the Jesuits, to whom Alexander
</p>
<p>had given refuge, when they were driven out of all other

<p>states. Their modern panegyrist, M. Cretineau-Joly, by no
</p>
<p>means denies that there was a close and intimate connection
</p>
<p>between M. de Maistre and the Jesuits. " He supported
</p>
<p>them," says he, "as one of the key-stones of the social
</p>
<p>arch." *
</p>
<p>Alexander, who was addicted to mysticism, and strongly
</p>
<p>attached to the Holy Scriptures, warmly encouraged the

<p>Bible societies. " The emperor," says the writer whom we
</p>
<p>have just quoted, " had suffered himself to be deceived.

<p>Prince Galitzin, the minister of worship, the highest

<p>Stanislas Siestrzencewiez, became avowed patrons of an
</p>
<p>institution, which was in ihe long run to strike a mortal blow
</p>
<p>at ihe Greek religion and at Catholicism. There rose up in

<p>Russia, in favour of the Bible Society, one of those enthu

<p>who live remote from the scene of action. Anglicanism
</p>
<p>was securing a footing from the shores of the Black Sea to

<p>those of the Frozen Ocean, and was spreading eastwards
</p>
<p>towards the frontiers of China. Prompted by Galitzin, the
</p>
<p>Catholic prelates served as blind instruments in its propa

<p>gation, and encouraged their flocks to favour this work, of
</p>
<p>the tendencies of which they were, themselves, wholly
</p>
<p>ignorant." The Jesuits knew the danger of placing the Scriptures

<p>them, Reflect and judge ! Such of the innovators as were
</p>
<p>Catholics were denounced to Pius VII., who severely
</p>
<p>reprimanded them. Is it not, in fact, an unpardonable
</p>
<p>audacity, to follow this precept of Jesus : " Search the
</p>
<p>Scriptures ; it is they which testify of me " ? The Scriptures,
</p>
<p>then, speak, and even testify ; this, however, M. de Maistre
</p>
<p>denies ; and, doubtless, his judgment has more weight than
</p>
<p>that of Christ !
</p>
<p>"Let others," he exclaims, "invoke, as much as you
</p>
<p>please, ihe mute word ; we live in peace with this false God,
</p>
<p>(the Bible !) awaiting evermore with fond impatience the
</p>
<p>moment when its partizans shall be undeceived, and shall
</p>
<p>throw themselves into our arms, which have been open to

<p>receive them during the last three centuries." * So then
</p>
<p>the Bible, submitted to the right of private judgment, is
</p>
<p>but a false God, a mute word; it only becomes intelligible
</p>
<p>in one single mouth  that of the pope. Moreover, this
</p>
<p>book is incomplete ; the little that is found there is only a
</p>
<p>germ. " Never was there a shallower notion," says De
</p>
<p>Maistre, " than that of seeking in the Bible the whole sum
</p>
<p>of the Christian dogmas."
</p>
<p>The same writer is shocked at the idea of seeking to
</p>
<p>verify whether laws or creeds are conformable to equity, or
</p>
<p>to the doctrines of the apostles.
</p>
<p>"What man of sense," cries he, "would not shudder to

<p>put his hand to such a work ? ' We must revert,' we are

<p>are very ready to lend an ear to such exhortations.' This is
</p>
<p>well said ; nothing can be better. But behold what is

<p>man ! The author of this observation (Pascal) and his

<p>hideous sect (the Jansenists) have never ceased to play this

<p>infallibly ruinous game ; and in fact ihe game has perfectly

<p>succeeded." *
</p>
<p>This is what irritates him ; this is what he cannot bear ;
</p>
<p>he sees no hope of safety but in compression; he insists
</p>
<p>that the altar and the throne should be sacred, and quite
</p>
<p>above all question. Has he not then, erudite as he is, read
</p>
<p>how Lactantius, the celebrated apologist, upbraided the
</p>
<p>Pagan priests? "They make themselves slaves to the
</p>
<p>creed of their forefathers ; they aver that it is to be adopted

<p>on trust ; they divest themselves of their reason ; but those

<p>who have enveloped religion in mystery, in order that the

<p>people may be ignorant of what they adore, are but knaves

<p>and deceivers." -j-
</p>
<p>M. de Maistre himself has said : " Never can error be

<p>useful, or truth hurtful." This does not prevent him from
</p>
<p>maintaining elsewhere, that error is necessary  that it has
</p>
<p>its advantages  and that truth ought often to be held

<p>captive. " The world," he says, " always contains an innumera

</p>
<p>certain things, they could also increase immensely the

<p>emblem. But the Jesuits, applauded by M. de Maistre and
</p>
<p>by Pius VII. , have done their utmost to put the light
</p>
<p>under a bushel. They have raised every possible obstacle
</p>
<p>to the propagation of the Bible. " They opposed it,"
</p>
<p>remarks M. Cretineau-Joly, " with a firmness which the
</p>
<p>prayers and menaces of Galitzin, up to that time their
</p>
<p>protector and friend, could never overcome. The partizans
</p>
<p>of the Bible societies became leagued against the Com
</p>
<p>pany." * Now, the Jesuits have taken good care not to
</p>
<p>oppose version to version. They have uniformly opposed
</p>
<p>every version, and their intrigues on this subject were one
</p>
<p>of the causes of their expulsion from Russia, on the 13th of
</p>
<p>March, 1820. Does not this explain, in some sort, the
</p>
<p>explosion of rage against the Bible itself, which the reader
</p>
<p>has remarked in the secret conference ?
</p>
<p>Previously to this period, the Jesuits, as their apologist

<p>admits, were at open and bitter feud with the Russian

<p>universities. On that occasion they found, says the same

<p>the follies and crimes which the revolutionary spirit has

<p>children of all ages, and the patience of sovereigns ; it
</p>
<p>reserves its noisier manifestations for a future time.' After
</p>
<p>uttering these words, the truth of which becomes more and
</p>
<p>more apparent as the circle of revolution enlarges, and
</p>
<p>monarchs sink deeper into the fatal slumber of indifference,
</p>
<p>Joseph de Maistre adds : ' In the midst of dangers so pressing,
</p>
<p>nothing can be of greater utility to his Imperial Majesty
</p>
<p>than a society of men essentially inimical to that from which
</p>
<p>Russia has everything to dread, especially in the education
</p>
<p>of youth. I do not even believe that it would be possible to
</p>
<p>substitute with advantage any other preservative. This society
</p>
<p>is the watch-dog, which you should beware of sending away.
</p>
<p>If you do not choose that he should bite the robbers, that
</p>
<p>is your affair ; but let him, at least, roam round the house,
</p>
<p>and awake you when necessary, before your doors are
</p>
<p>broken open, or the thieves get in by the windows.'"
</p>
<p>This language is intelligible ; the imagery is striking :
</p>
<p>the Jesuits are, truly, the vigilant watch-dogs of absolute
</p>
<p>governments, who rouse them from their sleep when neces
</p>
<p>sary, and are always ready to bite those who would invade
</p>
<p>their repose. Do they not boast of possessing the statistics
</p>
<p>of everybody's thoughts, and of being alone able to predict
</p>
<p>the periods of the political tides ? Thus M. Cretineau
</p>
<p>quotes these words of John Miiller as profoundly judicious : 
</p>
<p>" Wise men did not hesitate to conclude, that with the
</p>
<p>Jesuits fell a common and necessary barrier of defence for
</p>
<p>all powers." The rampart of the old order of things being thus over

<p>thrown, M. de Maistre gives vent to his wrath in these

<p>terms :

<p>place." Emboldened by these prognostics, he adds: 
</p>
<p>" Catholicism is taking its measures to assure itself anew of
</p>
<p>the sword of France."
</p>
<p>It is impossible, however, to be more daring than was De
</p>
<p>Maistre; he propounds the most formidable views, so that
</p>
<p>you would say he wrote with a portion of the secret plan before
</p>
<p>him. He lived in a time when the defeats of freedom were
</p>
<p>too recent to make him at all cautious in measuring his words.
</p>
<p>His successors are, in general, more anxious to disguise
</p>
<p>their odious projects. Often blunt and offensive, but always
</p>
<p>frank, M. de Maistre was too well acquainted with the
</p>
<p>falsity of the double system he so vigorously defended, to
</p>
<p>suppose, for a moment, that it could maintain itself under
</p>
<p>the rule of liberty. He deems, therefore, that the inquisition
</p>
<p>and the executioner ought to form its corner-stone.
</p>
<p>"There must," he says, "be some authority against
</p>
<p>which no one has the right to argue. To reason, said Saint
</p>
<p>Thomas, is to seek, and to be always seeking is to be never

<p>desired to the end that " the crushed party may have time

</p>
<p>But why should not each party enjoy the same rights,

<p>ing to his notion, liberty is a privilege which belongs only

<p>to nobles and prelates. What, he indignantly demands,
</p>
<p>is the source of this flood of detestable doctrines ? " It
</p>
<p>proceeds," he answers, "from that numerous phalanx of

<p>what are called learned men, whom we have not persisted

<p>in keeping in their proper place, which is the second."*
</p>
<p>This champion of the faith, who has God and religion
</p>
<p>perpetually on his lips, covers with these sounding words a
</p>
<p>system of barbarous oppression for all that is most sacred in
</p>
<p>man : he would have two castes, as masters, holding all the
</p>
<p>rest in slavery.
</p>
<p>" It is not to science that it belongs to guide mankind :
</p>
<p>it has none of the necessary powers for this purpose. It
</p>
<p>belongs to prelates, to nobles, to the great officers of the
</p>
<p>state, to be the depositaries and guardians of the truth ;
</p>
<p>to teach the nations what is evil and what is good, what
</p>
<p>is true and what false in moral and spiritual things : none
</p>
<p>others have any right to reason upon matters of this nature.
</p>
<p>They have the natural sciences to amuse themselves with 
</p>
<p>of what do they complain ? As to the man who speaks or
</p>
<p>writes so as to take away a national dogma from the people,
</p>
<p>he ought to be hung as a common thief. Why has so great
</p>
<p>an imprudence been committed as to grant liberty of speech
</p>
<p>to every one ? It is this that has undone us. Philoso
</p>
<p>phers (those at least who assume the name) are all possessed

<p>with a sort of fierce and rebellious pride which takes

<p>nothing for granted ; they detest all distinctions of which

</p>
<p>Leave them alone, and they will attack everything, even
</p>
<p>God himself, because he is their master. Is it not these
</p>
<p>very men who have written against kings and against him
</p>
<p>who has established them ! Oh ! if, when ihe earth shall
</p>
<p>be settled ."*
</p>
<p>M. de Maistre here suddenly checks himself. He has,
</p>
<p>however, said enough to betray his gigantic hopes that
</p>
<p>the old system shall be re-established, that free inquiry
</p>
<p>shall be abolished, that all independence shall be impossible
</p>
<p>for the people, and that priests and nobles alone shall reign.
</p>
<p>He quotes this saying of Cardinal de Retz : " He who
</p>
<p>assembles the people stirs them up to insurrection." The
</p>
<p>commentary which he makes upon it is worthy of himself.
</p>
<p>" A maxim," he says, " the spirit of which is unimpeach
</p>
<p>able. The laws of fermentation are the same in morals as
</p>
<p>in physics. It arises from contact, and augments in
</p>
<p>proportion to the mass of the fermenting matters. Collect a
</p>
<p>number of men rendered spirituous by any passion whatever :
</p>
<p>you will shortly have heat, then excitement, and presently
</p>
<p>delirium will ensue, precisely as in the material process, where
</p>
<p>the turbulent fermentation leads rapidly to the acid, and
</p>
<p>this is speedily followed by the putrid. Every assembly is
</p>
<p>liable to the action of this general law, if the process is not
</p>
<p>arrested by the cold of authority, which glides into the
</p>
<p>interstices and stops the movement of the particles."f
</p>
<p>Consequently, meetings of the people must be interdicted.
</p>
<p>But, at least, the people may have the right to represent
</p>
<p>themselves by deputies ? See what one of the boldest
</p>
<p>defenders of the Jesuits says on this question.

<p>" In the courts of law," he says, " it happens every day
</p>
<p>that infants, the insane, and the absent are represented by
</p>
<p>men who are deputed only by the law ; now the people is
</p>
<p>eminently characterized by these three qualities  it is
</p>
<p>always infant, always insane, and always absent. Why
</p>
<p>therefore cannot its guardians be appointed without its
</p>
<p>own sanction ?
</p>
<p>" There is no king by the grace of the people. Nobility
</p>
<p>being but a prolongation of the sovereignty, magnum jovis
</p>
<p>incrementum, it repeats, on a smaller scale, all the
</p>
<p>characteristics of its parent. The true nobility is the
</p>
<p>natural guardian of religion, it is the parent of the priest
</p>
<p>hood, and its constant and natural protector. Appius
</p>
<p>Clodius exclaimed, in the Roman senate, ' Religion
</p>
<p>belongs to the patricians, auspicia sunt patrum.' Wo to
</p>
<p>the people whose nobles abandon the national dogmas !
</p>
<p>France, which furnishes the most striking examples both in
</p>
<p>good and in evil, has proved this to the whole world : for
</p>
<p>that Bacchante, called the French Revolution, and who has,
</p>
<p>as yet, only changed her dress, is the daughter of the
</p>
<p>impious commerce of the French nobility with the philosophy
</p>
<p>of the eighteenth century. The disciples of the Alcoran
</p>
<p>say : ' One of the signs of the end of tne world will
</p>
<p>be the advance of persons of low condition to eminent
</p>
<p>dignities.'" "If the nobility," he goes on to say, "renounce the
</p>
<p>conservative religion, what right have they to expect to be
</p>
<p>themselves conserved ? Why should they be better treated
</p>
<p>than their masters, whose reign has been shortened ?

<p>OF THE JESUITS. 203
</p>
<p>constituted, and can only be preserved by one sole religion,
</p>
<p>and that if this alliance fails them, they must inevitably fall.
</p>
<p>" In order to establish one religion and one morality in
</p>
<p>Europe ; to give to the truth the strength which her
</p>
<p>meditated conquests will require ; to confirm the thrones of
</p>
<p>sovereigns, and allay this general fermentation in the minds of
</p>
<p>the people, which threatens us with so many misfortunes, one
</p>
<p>preliminary measure is indispensable, and that is, to efface
</p>
<p>from the European dictionary the fatal word protestantism."
</p>
<p>" In the sixteenth century, the rebels attributed the
</p>
<p>sovereignty to the church, that is to say, to the people.
</p>
<p>The eighteenth century only transfers these maxims to
</p>
<p>politics ; it is the same system, the same theory, up to its
</p>
<p>remotest consequences. What difference is there between
</p>
<p>the church of God, ruled solely by his word, and the
</p>
<p>republic, one and indivisible, governed solely by the laws
</p>
<p>and by the deputies of the sovereign people ? It is the
</p>
<p>same folly, having only changed its name with its epoch.
</p>
<p>" Yes, it was the Reformers, who, sounding the tocsin
</p>
<p>against the pope and Rome, struck the first blow at the
</p>
<p>ancient and venerable colossus of the Roman hierarchy ;
</p>
<p>and by directing the minds of men towards the investigation
</p>
<p>of religious dogmas, prepared them to discuss also the
</p>
<p>principles of sovereignty, and thus sapped the foundations
</p>
<p>both of throne and altar.
</p>

<p>which is only accepted by reason, and discusses points of

</p>
<p>therefore does M. de Maistre desire that this error, the
</p>
<p>fruitful root of many others, should be extinguished by
</p>
<p>kings themselves.
</p>
<p>"Help me," he says, "with all speed to make it
</p>
<p>disappear the more quickly. It is impossible that con
</p>
<p>siderations so important should not at length make their
</p>
<p>way into Protestant council chambers, and be stored up

<p>there, to descend after a time like fertilizing water into
</p>
<p>the valleys. There is every inducement for the Pro
</p>
<p>testants to unite with us. Their science, which is now
</p>
<p>a horrid corrosive, will lose its deleterious qualities in allying
</p>
<p>itself with our submission, which will not refuse in its turn
</p>
<p>to derive light from their science. This great change must,

<p>however, begin with the sovereigns."*
</p>
<p>None are so much interested as the great in the

<p>adhere to error is always a great evil ; but to teach it by

</p>
<p>the extreme of evil, and absolute blindness is its inevitable

<p>consequence." We have, then, a right to distrust doctrines which are

</p>
<p>is to be justly suspected.  Du Pape, p. 476.
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 205
</p>
<p>VI.
</p>
<p>In 1804, at the very moment when kings were struggling
</p>
<p>under the grasp of their conqueror, and plotting useless
</p>
<p>coalitions, Pius VII., so far from surrendering a jot of the
</p>
<p>ancient Roman supremacy, wrote thus to his nuncio, at
</p>
<p>Vienna : 
</p>
<p>" THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CANON LAW IS THIS :
</p>
<p>That the subjects of a heretic prince are liberated from
</p>
<p>all duty, all fealty and homage towards him." " Those
</p>
<p>who are at all versed in history," he remarks, " cannot but
</p>
<p>be acquainted with ihe sentences and depositions pronounced
</p>
<p>by pontiffs and councils against princes who persisted in
</p>
<p>heresy." "In good truth," concludes Pius VII., "we are fallen
</p>
<p>upon times of great calamity, and of such deep humiliation
</p>
<p>for the spouse of Jesus Christ, that it is not possible for her
</p>
<p>to practise many of her holy maxims, nor even expedient
</p>
<p>for her to bring them forward ; and she is, at the same
</p>
<p>time, forced to interrupt the course of her just severity
</p>
<p>against the enemies of ihe faith."
</p>
<p>Thus we are warned. Rome (unless Pius IX.
</p>
<p>accomplish a complete revolution in its traditions) is not
</p>
<p>less tenacious of its canonical rights than are kings and
</p>
<p>nobles of their prerogatives. They protest that God is the
</p>
<p>author of these. Absolution is holy, the theocratic system
</p>
<p>is sacrosanct. It has never been destroyed, it is only
</p>
<p>suspended until the passing away of these times, so
</p>
<p>calamitous and humiliating to the church, for days of glory

<p>are promised to her. Then, every sovereign who shall be
</p>
<p>206 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>heretical, or even of suspected faith, shall either be con
</p>
<p>verted or deprived of his throne; the holy maxims of
</p>
<p>ancient times shall revive, and a just severity against the
</p>
<p>enemies of the faith shall renew its course.
</p>
<p>VII.
</p>
<p>It is not without reason that M. de Montalembert,
</p>
<p>while defending the Jesuits against those who reproach
</p>
<p>them with their vow of absolute obedience to the popes, is
</p>
<p>astounded at this accusation, and remarks that the bishops
</p>
<p>still make oath of absolute submission to the pope, in
</p>
<p>clauses and terms the most precise, strong, and compre
</p>
<p>hensive ; and yet this important oath has never, till now,
</p>
<p>been a subject of accusation. Let us attach to each word
</p>
<p>its proper value, and we shall perceive that everything in
</p>
<p>this formula combines to render the pope the absolute chief
</p>
<p>of the world, as well temporal as spiritual, and that we
</p>
<p>must not therefore be surprised that the bishops spare no
</p>
<p>efforts to make the ecclesiastical jurisdiction predominate
</p>
<p>over every civil jurisdiction. Before he receives the mitre
</p>
<p>each bishop swears thus : 
</p>
<p>" I will do all that in me lies to pursue, defend, increase,
</p>
<p>and strengthen the rights, honours, privileges, and the
</p>
<p>authority of the holy Roman church of our lord the pope
</p>
<p>and his successors.
</p>
<p>" I will humbly receive the apostolic commands (the
</p>
<p>orders of the pope), and I will apply myself to their execu
</p>
<p>tion with the greatest zeal and the strictest punctuality.

<p>" I promise and swear that I will with all my might
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 207
</p>
<p>persecute and combat all heretics, schismatics, and rebels
</p>
<p>to our lord the pope." *
</p>
<p>As for the priests, every one knows that they are bound to
</p>
<p>swear implicit obedience to their bishops. It is exactly the
</p>
<p>same with the different orders and religious congregations.
</p>
<p>The Jesuits are, therefore, not the only ones bound by vow
</p>
<p>to labour for the restoration of Rome's sovereign power,
</p>
<p>and for the subjection of temporal rulers. What distin
</p>
<p>guishes them from other orders is their perfect accordance
</p>
<p>with theocratic principles, and the unremitting energy with
</p>
<p>which they follow them up to all their consequences. They
</p>
<p>it is who sustain the burden of the strife, and spur on the
</p>
<p>combatants. Just now, indeed, the superior clergy, though never
</p>
<p>ceasing to extol the Jesuits, find themselves compelled to
</p>
<p>use language somewhat more liberal than formerly. But who
</p>
<p>will believe that these manifestations are genuine ? Has not
</p>
<p>Father Roothaan himself but lately declared that his order
</p>
<p>applauded the tendencies and the acts of the new pope ?
</p>
<p>Does he not loudly protest against those who have written
</p>
<p>that in Piedmont and Sicily, as well as in the Roman
</p>
<p>States, the Jesuits are striving to turn away princes from
</p>
<p>encouraging progress ? Is he not indignant that they should
</p>
<p>be styled retrograde, and they should be accused of favouring
</p>
<p>the system of Metternich ?

<p>Ex pontificali Romano, capite de consacratione episcoporum.

<p>208 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>"Our Company," he says, "is a religious order, solemnly
</p>
<p>approved by the church. Its sole object is the glory of
</p>
<p>God and the salvation of souls ; its means are the practice
</p>
<p>of the evangelical counsels, and the zeal of which the
</p>
<p>apostles and apostolic men of all ages have set it the
</p>
<p>example. It knows no other means. It is a stranger to
</p>
<p>politics ; and has never allied itself with any party what
</p>
<p>soever. Calumny may be pleased to spread perfidious
</p>
<p>insinuations, and to represent the Jesuits as mixed up with
</p>
<p>political intrigues ; but I defy any one to point out to me a
</p>
<p>single priest, amongst those who are subordinate to me,
</p>
<p>who has departed on this point from the spirit and the
</p>
<p>formal prescriptions of our institution.
</p>
<p>" Will any one pretend to insinuate that the Jesuits of
</p>
<p>the Roman States have made an alliance with Austria ?
</p>
<p>Surely this would be attributing a singular importance to
</p>
<p>these men of religion ! But this supposition is so contrary
</p>
<p>to common sense, reason, and evidence, that it does not
</p>
<p>even require to be refuted.
</p>
<p>" The Company of Jesus, like the church, has neither
</p>
<p>antipathy nor predilection for the political constitutions of
</p>
<p>the several states. Its members accept with sincerity the
</p>
<p>form of government under which Providence has marked
</p>
<p>their place, whether a friendly power encourages them, or
</p>
<p>whether it merely respects in them the rights which they
</p>
<p>enjoy in common with other citizens.
</p>
<p>"If the political institutions of the country they inhabit
</p>
<p>are defective, they quietly endure their defects ; if they are
</p>
<p>in course of improvement, they applaud every amelioration;
</p>
<p>if those institutions grant new privileges to the people,

</p>
<p>they claim their just share of this advantage ; if they
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS 209
</p>
<p>become open to more extended and liberal views, the
</p>
<p>Jesuits profit by this to give more extension to works of
</p>
<p>beneficence and zeal. Everywhere they bow before the
</p>
<p>laws ; they respect public authorities ; they are endowed
</p>
<p>with all the feelings of good and loyal citizens ; they
</p>
<p>partake with these their obligations, their burdens, and
</p>
<p>their rejoicings.
</p>
<p>" It is as contrary to truth as to public notoriety that the
</p>
<p>Jesuits are in a state of permanent conspiracy against the
</p>
<p>august pontiff whom the whole universe salutes with its
</p>
<p>acclamations. To love, venerate, bless, and defend Pope
</p>
<p>Pius IX., to obey him in all things, to applaud the wise
</p>
<p>reforms and ameliorations which he shall be pleased to
</p>
<p>introduce, is for every Jesuit a duty of conscience and of
</p>
<p>justice, which it will ever be grateful to him to fulfil." *
</p>
<p>Up to this day, then, history has been nothing else,
</p>
<p>with regard to the Jesuits, than a perpetual calumny  a
</p>
<p>diabolical conspiracy. Thus, we are not to accept any
</p>
<p>historians but such as are sanctioned by them. What has
</p>
<p>been seen in past times, what is seen at present, is not to
</p>
<p>be believed ; the most authentic witnesses are to be sacri
</p>
<p>ficed to the immaculate purity of this innocent order. At
</p>
<p>Lucerne, at Freiburg, in the Valais, in all places where
</p>
<p>they have succeeded in establishing their influence, however
</p>
<p>heavy may be the chains with which they have laden the
</p>
<p>people, however intolerable the compression which they
</p>
<p>have established, we are to call it all the reign of social
</p>
<p>rights and of true liberty ! Well ; let us say nothing more

<p>decrees the Grand Council of the Valais, acting under their

<p>direction, has pronounced against illicit assemblies, blameable

<p>reports and speeches, &c. Here follows the first article :

<p>" A fine of from twenty to two hundred francs, and

</p>
<p>years, or one of these punishments only, shall be inflicted

<p>on those who shall utter scandalous words against ihe holy

<p>punished according to ihe criminal laws; likewise on those who

<p>ingly, or without authorization, writings or infamous books, or

<p>caricatures, which attack ihe holy religion of the state or its

</p>
<p>" A citizen of the Valais happens to give it as his

<p>perhaps, further ; he disputes the title of the Virgin Mary
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 211
</p>
<p>to the adoration of the faithful, and maintains that the
</p>
<p>Roman church is at variance on this point with the New
</p>
<p>Testament :  this is more than scandal, it is a blasphemy,
</p>
<p>and blasphemy is a crime in this exceedingly well-governed
</p>
<p>canton. Our citizen of the Valais, with rash temerity,
</p>
<p>affirms that the morality of the Jesuits is sometimes very
</p>
<p>immoral : blasphemy in the highest degree, and an igno
</p>
<p>minious punishment must be awarded for so heinous a
</p>
<p>crime !
</p>
<p>" Is it conceivable that a law of this nature should be
</p>
<p>promulgated in 1845, on the frontiers of France and of Italy,
</p>
<p>in the very face of a press which takes note of all these
</p>
<p>atrocities ; whilst the Jesuits wish to make it appear that
</p>
<p>they are prepared to admit a certain liberty ? Is it
</p>
<p>comprehensible that they should offer to all Europe the
</p>
<p>spectacle of this ignoble thirst for despotism, this base and
</p>
<p>odious impudence, for which no name is strong enough in
</p>
<p>any known human tongue ? Our country (France) was
</p>
<p>justly and deeply enraged against the law of sacrilege, which
</p>
<p>was abolished in obedience to the unanimous voice of the
</p>
<p>nation, after the days of July. But what was this law of
</p>
<p>sacrilege compared with the law promulgated in the Valais
</p>
<p>on the subject of scandalous words against the Catholic
</p>
<p>religion or its ministers ? It was mildness, gentleness, and
</p>
<p>tolerance itself. It was only called into operation on the

<p>VIII.
</p>
<p>Just as I had finished these lines there was discovered
</p>
<p>in the Bibliotheque Royale a manuscript, containing on the
</p>
<p>subject of the Jesuits some pages which were not intended
</p>
<p>for publication, and which possess a curious interest at the
</p>
<p>distance of two hundred years from the date when they
</p>
<p>were written. They are by Thomas Campanella, well
</p>
<p>known by his book on the City of ihe Sun and other works,
</p>
<p>but still more celebrated for afflictions which would have
</p>
<p>subdued any other soul than his. His testimony comes
</p>
<p>forth opportunely after having remained buried nearly two
</p>
<p>centuries. Campanella's pages may be considered the
</p>
<p>complement of the Secret Plan ; we learn from them once
</p>
<p>more by what occult mechanism some thousands of men
</p>
<p>dispersed over the face of the globe succeed in exercising
</p>
<p>an almost incredible power. I pass over pages of the celer
</p>
<p>brated Dominican, which contain only what would seem a
</p>
<p>tedious repetition of facts and artifices already divulged in
</p>
<p>books that have obtained great notoriety ; and will only
</p>
<p>remark with Campanella, who adduces historical facts in
</p>
<p>proof of his assertion, that the Jesuits only exhibit great
</p>
<p>zeal for the pope's infallibility when it serves their own plans,
</p>
<p>but that they make not the least account of it when it speaks
</p>
<p>in a tone of authority to impose restraints and rules upon
</p>
<p>them. Let us hear the author.*

<p>some fathers who are called assistants because they con
</p>
<p>tinually aid him. There is at least one of these for each
</p>
<p>nation, by whose name he is called, one being styled the
</p>
<p>Assistant of France, another of Spain, a third of Italy, a
</p>
<p>fourth of England, a fifth of Austria, and so on for all the
</p>
<p>other provinces and kingdoms. Each of them has for
</p>
<p>office to acquaint the father-general as to all events of state
</p>
<p>which take place in the province or kingdom, for which he is
</p>
<p>assistant ; and this he does by means of his correspondents
</p>
<p>who reside in the provincial towns of the said kingdom.
</p>
<p>Now these correspondents inform themselves with scrupu
</p>
<p>lous care as to the character, inclinations, and intentions of
</p>
<p>the sovereigns, and by each courier they acquaint the
</p>
<p>assistant with whatever facts have recently occurred or
</p>
<p>been brought to light. These are immediately communica
</p>
<p>ted by the assistant to the father-general, who thereupon
</p>
<p>assembling his council, they proceed together to perform an
</p>
<p>anatomy of the world, and scrutinize the interests or the
</p>
<p>projects of all christian princes. After having weighed all
</p>
<p>the documents, they agree among themselves to favour the
</p>
<p>interests of one prince and thwart those of another, making
</p>
<p>everything turn to their own advantage. Now as the
</p>
<p>lookers-on more easily detect the sleigh ts-of-hand committed
</p>
<p>than those who are playing the game, so these fathers
</p>
<p>having under their eyes the interests of all princes, can very
</p>
<p>accurately appreciate the exigencies of times and places,
</p>
<p>and put in operation the most decisive means in order to
</p>
<p>favour a prince whom they are sure they can make use of
</p>
<p>for the realisation of their own interested views.

</p>
<p>whereby they are enabled to penetrate every design and
</p>
<p>resolution, to know the dispositions of princes and subjects,
</p>
<p>and to lay them before the father-general or an assistant.
</p>
<p>" Anybody of the least penetration may easily convince
</p>
<p>himself how many perplexities they can cause to those
</p>
<p>princes whom their own interests, the sole and exclusive
</p>
<p>motive of their actions, point out to them as adversaries.
</p>
<p>" Secrecy is necessary in state affairs : a state is undone
</p>
<p>when its secrets are divulged. But the Jesuit fathers, that
</p>
<p>is to say the father-general and his assistants, whether by
</p>
<p>means of the confessional or of the mutual consultations
</p>
<p>held by the correspondents who reside in all the chief
</p>
<p>towns of Christendom, or through other adherents, of whom
</p>
<p>we shall speak presently, are exactly and minutely informed
</p>
<p>of all the decisions come to in the most private councils ;
</p>
<p>and they know the forces, revenues, and expenditure of
</p>
<p>sovereigns, better in a manner than the sovereigns them
</p>
<p>selves. All this costs them only so much postage. At
</p>
<p>Rome alone, as the post-masters attest, their postages for
</p>
<p>each courier amount to 60 or 70, and often to 100 gold
</p>
<p>crowns. Being thus profoundly acquainted with the
</p>
<p>interests of all sovereigns, is it not in their power to
</p>
<p>weaken the credit of any one of them with the rest, to ruin
</p>
<p>any sovereign they please in the estimation of his people,
</p>
<p>to make the latter his enemies, and to instil the leaven of
</p>
<p>revolt into the state  and all this the more easily, since by
</p>
<p>means of confessions and consultations they penetrate into
</p>
<p>the most secret thoughts of the subjects ? "

<p>occult functions. " They have them," says Campanella,
</p>
<p>216 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>" in every kingdom, province, and court." Their choice
</p>
<p>falls on shrewd and adroit men, whom they recompense
</p>
<p>with pensions, benefices, or high offices.
</p>
<p>" The fourth kind," he says, "is that of the political
</p>
<p>Jesuits, in whose hands is the government of the whole
</p>
<p>order. They are of those whom the devil has tempted
</p>
<p>with that temptation which Christ endured in the wilder
</p>
<p>ness, hcec omnia tibi dabo ; and they have not shrunk from
</p>
<p>the offer. They have made it their task to constitute their
</p>
<p>company a perfect monarchy ; and they establish it in
</p>
<p>Rome, the centre of confluence for almost all the affairs of
</p>
<p>Christendom. There resides the chief of these politicians 
</p>
<p>that is to say, their general  with many others who profess
</p>
<p>the same maxims. Being informed beforehand, through
</p>
<p>their spies and numerous correspondents, of all the affairs
</p>
<p>of the greatest importance which are pending at the court
</p>
<p>of Rome, and having their minds fixed upon those issues
</p>
<p>which accord with their own interests, each of them is
</p>
<p>assiduous in attendance on the cardinals, ambassadors, and
</p>
<p>prelates, with whom they adroitly ingratiate themselves.
</p>
<p>They talk to them of the affair in question or about to be
</p>
<p>brought forward  represent it under such colours as suit
</p>
<p>themselves  and do this so cleverly, that they make their
</p>
<p>hearers believe black is white. And forasmuch as first
</p>
<p>impressions, especially when they are derived from clerical
</p>
<p>persons, usually leave deep traces on the mind, it follows
</p>
<p>that extremely important negociations, conducted by ambas
</p>
<p>sadors, princes, and other eminent personages of the Roman
</p>
<p>court, have often not succeeded as princes would have

<p>desired, the Jesuits having forestalled the influence of the

</p>
<p>" The same artfulness which they use with the Roman
</p>
<p>prelates, they exhibit also in their dealings with sovereigns,
</p>
<p>either directly or through the medium of the Jesuits of the
</p>
<p>second class who are away from Rome. Thus does the
</p>
<p>greater part of the affairs of Christendom pass through the
</p>
<p>hands of the Jesuits ; and those affairs alone succeed to
</p>
<p>which they offer no resistance.
</p>
<p>"They formerly supplicated His Holiness Gregory XIII.
</p>
<p>(on the colourable plea of the good of the Church) to enjoin
</p>
<p>all legates and apostolic nuncios to take, for companions and
</p>
<p>confidants, Jesuits whose councils should guide them in all
</p>
<p>their actions.
</p>
<p>" By such manoeuvres, and by that knowledge they
</p>
<p>have of affairs of state, the principal Jesuits have acquired
</p>
<p>the friendship of several temporal and spiritual princes,
</p>
<p>whom they have prevailed on to do and say many things
</p>
<p>for their advantage. Hence have resulted two great evils.
</p>
<p>" The first is, that, abusing the friendship and kindness
</p>
<p>of princes, they have not scrupled to ruin many rich and
</p>
<p>noble families, by usurping their patrimonies. They have
</p>
<p>enticed into their order such of the pupils in their schools
</p>
<p>as were most remarkable for their talents ; and very often,
</p>
<p>when the latter have become useless to them through
</p>
<p>infirmities or other causes, the Jesuits have turned them
</p>
<p>off under some pretext or another, but without restoring
</p>
<p>their property, of which, during the period of profession,
</p>
<p>the order had taken care to become possessor.
</p>
<p>" The second evil is, that these fathers are sedulous to
</p>
<p>make known the friendship and intimacy they enjoy with
</p>
<p>princes, and give it out for still greater than it really is, in

</p>
<p>order to engage the sympathies of all the ministers, and
</p>
<p>218 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>thus excite everybody to have recourse to them for obtain
</p>
<p>ing favours. They have publicly boasted of their ability to
</p>
<p>create cardinals, nuncios, lieutenants, governors, and other
</p>
<p>functionaries. There are some among them who have even
</p>
<p>made bold to affirm that their general can do much more
</p>
<p>than the pope ; and others have alleged that it is better to
</p>
<p>belong to their order than to be a cardinal. All these
</p>
<p>things have been said publicly ; and there is scarcely any
</p>
<p>one who, in conversing familiarly with them, has not heard
</p>
<p>them give utterance to the like sentiments.
</p>
<p>" Amply provided with resources of this kind, they
</p>
<p>affirm that they can favour or disgrace whomsoever they
</p>
<p>please ; and covering themselves with the cloak of religion,
</p>
<p>the better to secure belief, they often succeed in their
</p>
<p>designs. " It is not long since one of the leading Jesuits, speaking
</p>
<p>in public to one of the leading sovereigns in the name of
</p>
<p>his Company, began with these audacious words, founded
</p>
<p>on the notion that they are a Power:  'Our Company
</p>
<p>has always maintained a good understanding with your
</p>
<p>Serenity,' &c.
</p>
<p>" These reverend fathers make it their business to have
</p>
<p>it believed that all those whom the prince favours in any
</p>
<p>manner whatever have been their favourites ; and, by this
</p>
<p>means, they acquire more mastery over subjects than their
</p>
<p>monarch himself. This is highly prejudicial to the latter,
</p>
<p>both because it is inconsistent with every interest of state
</p>
<p>that ecclesiastics so ambitious and politic should have so
</p>
<p>much power over the will of ministers as to be able, if they
</p>
<p>please, to produce treason or riots ; and because, through

<p>their influence over the ministers, their adherents, they
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 219
</p>
<p>introduce sworn Jesuits into the prince's service as coun
</p>
<p>cillors or secretaries ; these, again, intrigue until they induce
</p>
<p>the prince to employ some Jesuits as confessors or preachers,
</p>
<p>and then all together ply their task as spies and informers,
</p>
<p>rendering a minute account to the general of all that passes
</p>
<p>in the secret councils. Thence it happens that certain
</p>
<p>projects get wind immediately, secrets of great importance
</p>
<p>are discovered, yet no one can tell who is the traitor, and
</p>
<p>sometimes suspicion falls on those who are not guilty."
</p>
<p>" As from different plants the alembic extracts an
</p>
<p>unguent capable of curing many sores ; as the bees suck
</p>
<p>honey from many flowers, so the Jesuit fathers draw profit
</p>
<p>from the infallible knowledge they have of all the interests
</p>
<p>of princes, and of the facts which occur in all parts, being
</p>
<p>skilled to the use of speech, so as to obtain their profit
</p>
<p>through the good or evil fortune of others, but more fre
</p>
<p>quently through the latter than the former. Often, too,
</p>
<p>they prevail with princes, whose dispositions they have
</p>
<p>already sounded, by hinting at the possession of great
</p>
<p>means to enable the latter to accomplish their designs and
</p>
<p>crown all their desires. But when by the help of princes
</p>
<p>they have succeeded in their views, judging that if they
</p>
<p>aided those princes to rise too high, the latter might one
</p>
<p>day do them a mischief, they begin, as lawyers do with
</p>
<p>their causes, to protract and delay everything, and, with
</p>
<p>surprising artifice and cunning, they turn the cards, and
</p>
<p>finally ruin the designs they had themselves suggested.
</p>
<p>" From all that has been said, it follows that the Jesuits
</p>
<p>never act with the least honesty towards any princes what
</p>
<p>ever, lay or ecclesiastic, and that they aid them only as far
</p>

</p>
<p>as their own interests require. It also follows that their
</p>
<p>220 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>aid should never be accepted by princes, and still less by
</p>
<p>prelates, because they are equally ready to bestow their
</p>
<p>attachment on everybody, and make themselves Frenchmen
</p>
<p>with the French, Spaniards with Spaniards, and so forth,
</p>
<p>according to circumstances ; and since, provided they
</p>
<p>compass their own ends, they care not though it be to the
</p>
<p>detriment of this one or that, the enterprises in which the
</p>
<p>Jesuit fathers have meddled have rarely had a good result.
</p>
<p>Moreover, knowing the interests of all princes, and
</p>
<p>being exactly informed of all that is daily transacted in the
</p>
<p>most secret councils, those who profess themselves partisans
</p>
<p>of France propose to the king, and his principal ministers,
</p>
<p>certain conditions of importance, which the political fathers
</p>
<p>transmit to them from Rome. Now, as they do the same
</p>
<p>with regard to Spain and other countries, there ensues such
</p>
<p>a jealous distrust in the hearts of princes that the one no
</p>
<p>longer puts any faith in the other, which is immensely
</p>
<p>prejudicial to the public tranquillity and the general welfare
</p>
<p>of the Christian world, such distrust rendering very difficult
</p>
<p>the formation of a league against the common enemy, for
</p>
<p>peace between the princes themselves is insecure.
</p>
<p>" Sometimes we see a person afflicted with a dangerous
</p>
<p>disease ; he shrieks out piteously ; every one thinks him in
</p>
<p>great danger, but no one can guess the nature and origin
</p>
<p>of the disease. Thus every one complains of the Jesuits :
</p>
<p>one, because he is persecuted by them ; another, because
</p>
<p>they have dealt dishonestly by him ; but still the evil goes
</p>
<p>on, and it is not easy to apprehend its cause. Now, that
</p>
<p>cause consists in their huge desire to aggrandise themselves
</p>
<p>evermore. To accomplish this, they will stop at nothing,

</p>
<p>or to oppress the poor, or to extort widows' fortunes, or to
</p>
<p>ruin the most noble families ; and they very often sow the
</p>
<p>seeds of suspicion among Christian princes, in order to have
</p>
<p>opportunities of mixing in their most important affairs.
</p>
<p>" To demonstrate how excessive is their passion for
</p>
<p>aggrandisement, I might adduce numberless proofs from
</p>
<p>experience. In the time of Gregory XIII. had not the
</p>
<p>Jesuits the audacity to solicit of the pope the investiture of
</p>
<p>all the parochial churches of Rome, in order to lay the
</p>
<p>foundations of their monarchy ? But what they could not
</p>
<p>obtain in Rome they have at last recently obtained in
</p>
<p>England, where they have procured the election of an
</p>
<p>arch-priest, bound by oath toi their Company. This man,
</p>
<p>far from protecting the clergy, is like a ravening wolf to
</p>
<p>all the priests who wish to be independent of the Jesuits,
</p>
<p>and drives them to despair, forbidding them to converse
</p>
<p>together under severe penalties. Almost all the English
</p>
<p>clergy have become sworn Jesuits, and none are now received
</p>
<p>in the colleges but those who pledge their words to become
</p>
<p>Jesuits ; so that should that kingdom return to Catholicism,
</p>
<p>England would give birth to an effective Jesuit monarchy,
</p>
<p>since the ecclesiastical revenues, all the abbeys, benefices,
</p>
<p>and bishoprics, the arch-priestships, and the other dignities,
</p>
<p>would be conferred on none but Jesuits.
</p>
<p>" If now, when they have no temporal jurisdiction,
</p>
<p>they exhibit to the world such great and scandalous dis
</p>
<p>orders, what would they do if unhappily one of them were
</p>
<p>elected pope ? In the first place, he would fill the sacred
</p>
<p>college with Jesuits, and by that means the pontificate
</p>
<p>would remain for ever in the hands of the Company.

<p>interests, and possessing the papal power, might they not

<p>endanger the states of several princes, especially those

<p>most contiguous to Rome ? The Jesuit pontiff would
</p>
<p>bestow on his order the investiture of some towns or of
</p>
<p>some temporal jurisdiction, in which it would adroitly
</p>
<p>maintain itself, to the great injury of other princes. When

<p>the sacred college was filled with Jesuits, the latter would

<p>be the arbiters of Christ's whole patrimony ; and like the

<p>dropsical patient, whose thirst increases as he drinks, the
</p>
<p>more greatness they acquired the more they would covet,
</p>
<p>and they would cause a thousand troubles. And as there

<p>is nothing so susceptible of changes as states, these fathers

<p>would put in operation all their artifices and resources, and

<p>would strive to disorganize everything in order to realize

<p>the startling project of dispensing priests, monks, or nuns,
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 223
</p>
<p>from real celibacy ? If it were so, it would still be very
</p>
<p>difficult to obtain tangible evidence of the promulgation of
</p>
<p>such a doctrine. Though I am of opinion that in its most
</p>
<p>audacious extreme it must have remained unrealized, I still
</p>
<p>believe that something of the kind has gone abroad ; and if
</p>
<p>I am not mistaken, I have met with some tokens of
</p>
<p>its existence. Nothing is more common than the licentiousness of the
</p>
<p>clergy, at least in Italy, where little pains are taken to
</p>
<p>conceal it ; for the heads of the church are the less disposed
</p>
<p>to visit it with punishment, since the impunity they extend
</p>
<p>to it seems a sort of compensation for the total sacrifice of
</p>
<p>freedom to which the clergy are still doomed.
</p>
<p>I knew a lady, a widow with one child, who was fre
</p>
<p>quently visited by a clergyman of staid habits and irre
</p>
<p>proachable character. No one in the world would have
</p>
<p>presumed to entertain the least suspicion as to the nature
</p>
<p>of their intercourse, so extremely respectful was their
</p>
<p>behaviour towards each other.
</p>
<p>One day, just as he had left the house, I paid a visit to
</p>
<p>the lady  a charming person, whose beauty was of the
</p>
<p>kind peculiar to that period of life at which youth is past,
</p>
<p>but decline has not begun. The moment I set eyes on her
</p>
<p>I was greatly surprised to see patches of white powder
</p>
<p>scattered over her bosom and shoulders. The venerable
</p>
<p>clergyman wore hair-powder.
</p>
<p>Unwilling to hurt her feelings, but regardful of her
</p>
<p>interest, I led her to a looking-glass, where she blushed in
</p>
<p>great confusion. I entreated her to pardon my boldness,
</p>
<p>assured her of my discretion, and at last put her at her

</p>
<p>ease. She then confessed to me that she tenderly loved
</p>
<p>224 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>that grave and austere man, whom any one, to look at him,
</p>
<p>would have supposed insensible to such a passion ; but she
</p>
<p>assured me that under a rough bark he concealed a warm
</p>
<p>and loving heart.
</p>
<p>Of course I did not allow so good an opportunity of
</p>
<p>putting questions to escape me. I asked her, in the first place,
</p>
<p>how her reverend friend reconciled his vow of chastity with
</p>
<p>his conduct." It is true," she said, " the church must have priests
</p>
<p>who are not married, for otherwise the clergy would lack
</p>
<p>authority and prestige ; and besides, confession is perhaps
</p>
<p>still more necessary than preaching (astonishing remark!);
</p>
<p>but If celibacy were abolished, there could be no more
</p>
<p>confession. On the other hand, how can men help loving?
</p>
<p>A man does not put off human nature when he becomes a
</p>
<p>priest. Now, there is but one way of reconciling these
</p>
<p>seeming contrarieties : and that is to love, and even with all
</p>
<p>the ardour of the senses, but without compromising the
</p>
<p>clergyman, making, if necessary, the greatest sacrifices 
</p>
<p>except, she added with a smile, that of not loving  in
</p>
<p>order not to expose the priesthood to the contempt or
</p>
<p>derision of the multitude.
</p>
<p>"As for our affection, it is no obstacle, we are very sure,
</p>
<p>to sacred duties : far from being so, it excites us to fulfil
</p>
<p>them with more devotedness. Perhaps you will be surprised
</p>
<p>if I tell you that he whom I love regards, as a recompense
</p>
<p>from God for his zeal, the possession of a mistress who so
</p>
<p>well understands her position, and conducts herself with
</p>
<p>such prudence."

</p>
<p>the vehement indignation with which the individual in
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 225
</p>
<p>question professed to regard such faults, and that this
</p>
<p>appeared to me an instance of bad faith and hypocrisy, she
</p>
<p>made answer that he acted in perfect sincerity ; for he
</p>
<p>believed firmly that the clergy ought to take care never to
</p>
<p>afford the laity grounds for scandal ; what incensed him was
</p>
<p>not the fact itself (since he knew well that every man, priest
</p>
<p>or lay, was irresistibly impelled to an attachment for some
</p>
<p>woman), but the levity and indifference to the interests of the
</p>
<p>church shown in the neglect of precautions against discovery,
</p>
<p>which are less difficult to take than is commonly supposed.
</p>
<p>Some years afterwards the lady's lover reaped the reward
</p>
<p>of his piety, decorum, and prudence, being appointed a
</p>
<p>bishop. His mistress accompanied him to his diocese,
</p>
<p>where he had no sooner arrived than he took measures
</p>
<p>which to many priests seemed intolerable. It was seriously
</p>
<p>believed that he was an enemy to the sex, and one of those
</p>
<p>whom nature has created incomplete. One of my friends,
</p>
<p>who was among the victims of these inexorable reforms,
</p>
<p>wrote and told me that he was living on bread and water
</p>
<p>in a convent, as a punishment for a liaison of which he had
</p>
<p>made no secret, and that he could not tell when his penance
</p>
<p>would end. He was not aware that I could deliver him
</p>
<p>forthwith. A sharp note addressed to the lady, in which I
</p>
<p>strongly reprobated the rigour displayed in the case, pro
</p>
<p>duced the desired effect. I saw her some time afterwards.
</p>
<p>She defended the prelate's conduct, and thought he was
</p>
<p>right in not tolerating those thoughtless and awkward
</p>
<p>persons who exposed the church to such serious disadvan
</p>
<p>tages. You know well, she said, that his lordship is not
</p>
<p>so unjust as to desire that his priests should surpass human

</p>
<p>and circumspection for the honour of the church. And
</p>
<p>then, as she had picked up a smattering of Latin, she
</p>
<p>quoted to me (from St. Paul !) these words, which the
</p>
<p>bishops are constantly repeating to the clergy : Si non

</p>
<p>Let us now refer to Section XV. of the Secret Sitting,
</p>
<p>in which mention is made of the hospitals a, la Saint Roch.
</p>
<p>This passage would have remained for me a dead letter,
</p>
<p>but for a fact which cast a strong light upon it.
</p>
<p>When very young, I had been placed as a boarder with
</p>
<p>an ex-Capuchin, Father Evasio Fantini, who was every
</p>
<p>moment beset by crowds of penitents of every rank and
</p>
<p>condition. What I saw and heard early excited in me
</p>
<p>reflections which were not without influence on the bent of
</p>
<p>my mind. At a later period I passed some time with the
</p>
<p>old man during my vacations, and used to accompany him
</p>
<p>in all his walks, delighting to hear him call up his recollec
</p>
<p>tions of the cloisters, of which he was a living echo. He
</p>
<p>took pleasure in making me acquainted with everything
</p>
<p>that passed in them to the minutest details, with a frankness
</p>
<p>and kindly simplicity worthy of his age. What I learned
</p>
<p>from him was more useful to me, towards judging of
</p>
<p>monks and the monastic system, than all the books I
</p>
<p>have since read.
</p>
<p>One evening at Casal Monferrat, as we were returning
</p>
<p>home from a walk, we observed an extraordinary bustle

</p>
<p>and excitement, and soon learned that faint cries had been
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 227
</p>
<p>heard issuing from underground in a girl's boarding-school ;
</p>
<p>masons had been employed to search the spot, and a new
</p>
<p>born infant had been found in a disgustingly filthy state in
</p>
<p>the privy of the house occupied by D. Bossola, a parish
</p>
<p>priest of the town. D. Bossola and his servant-woman
</p>
<p>were proved guilty. I will not repeat all the observations
</p>
<p>uttered among the crowd ; it was not safe for priests to be
</p>
<p>seen there at such a moment, and we hastily came away.
</p>
<p>The priest was sent to a convent, and his accomplice was
</p>
<p>incarcerated. And, by-the-bye, there was much talk some
</p>
<p>time afterwards of the interest shown for her by the clergy ;
</p>
<p>she received visits, was comforted, aided, protected, and
</p>
<p>treated with the most assiduous kindness.
</p>
<p>Just as Father Fantini and I were quitting the spot, we
</p>
<p>were accosted by a reverend Jesuit father, who had just
</p>
<p>stepped out of a carriage, and learned the whole story.
</p>
<p>He was angry, but for reasons we were far from suspecting.
</p>
<p>" Never would such things happen," he said to us, " if
</p>
<p>the clergy, and especially the bishops, had an ounce of
</p>
<p>brains" (un' oncia di sale in zacca). " Those who wielded
</p>
<p>power, religious or political, were all a pack of asses. It
</p>
<p>ought to be impossible for such dangerous scandals ever to
</p>
<p>be made public."
</p>
<p>"What would you do to prevent it?" said the old
</p>
<p>ex-Capuchin. " You Jesuits are men with grand secrets ;
</p>
<p>but amongst them all you have not yet found a remedy for
</p>
<p>a great evil. You have not a secret for effecting that a
</p>
<p>man shall not be human. I have been confessing both
</p>
<p>sexes for fifty years ; the confessional is my main business.
</p>
<p>Now, up to this time my penitents have always been in the

<p>same tale ; one most obstinate sin holds the sceptre and
</p>
<p>228 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>sways all the rest ; and if God will not pass the sponge
</p>
<p>over it, hell will be paved with nothing but tonsures, and
</p>
<p>peopled only with celibataries."
</p>
<p>The Jesuit smiled, shook his head, and said he did not
</p>
<p>understand. " Leave human nature as it is," he said ; " men will not
</p>
<p>reform what has been made by an artificer who will suffer
</p>
<p>none to correct him. As for me, I think nature very good,
</p>
<p>especially on that point on which people so foolishly affect
</p>
<p>to consider her bad. One thing alone is important in the
</p>
<p>matter  namely, to know clearly whether it is intended
</p>
<p>that the church shall subsist, or shall share the fate of
</p>
<p>many another buried cult. Confession is the prime
</p>
<p>mover of the church ; and without celibacy there is no
</p>
<p>confession." I replied to him that it is not an easy thing to make
</p>
<p>celibacy and the confessional go together ;' that it is not
</p>
<p>easy to contrive that the candle shall not take fire when the
</p>
<p>match is applied to it.
</p>
<p>" Too true, alas !" said the old man immediately ; " the
</p>
<p>lamb will remain safe and sound under the wolf's tooth,
</p>
<p>before the young priest, with his passions glowing, can
</p>
<p>remain long without burning in the furnace of the
</p>
<p>confessional." " The evil," said the Jesuit, "is not where you see it.
</p>
<p>No one is afraid of burning in the furnace ; and the
</p>
<p>candle," he added slily, " likes to be lighted and relighted
</p>
<p>as long as it lasts."
</p>
<p>" I begin to understand you," said the old man. " Thou
</p>
<p>becomest thy name : Jesuit ! " (For venerated as he was

<p>the peasant to personages of the highest birth.*) " What
</p>
<p>you complain of is solely that the priest's honour suffers,
</p>
<p>that confession is jeopardised, and even in danger of total
</p>
<p>wreck." " I say, by all means pluck the rose," said the Jesuit ;
</p>
<p>" but no pricking of the fingers ! And to explain myself
</p>
<p>precisely, I will ask why means should not be taken to
</p>
<p>make it impossible that a priest should ever meet with
</p>
<p>mischances and be exposed to obloquy ? Might there not
</p>
<p>be provided in every province establishments, in which the
</p>
<p>sex which suffers most from the results of human weakness
</p>
<p>might find a refuge free from care or fear, or any of those
</p>
<p>consequences which make it so often repent of having
</p>
<p>yielded ? "
</p>
<p>" Why, you don't mean to say," exclaimed the old man,
</p>
<p>" that you would have a seraglio established in every dis
</p>
<p>trict, to which none should have access but monks and
</p>
<p>priests, and where they should find accomplices com
</p>
<p>fortably boarded, lodged, and clothed at the expense of
</p>
<p>the church ? "
</p>
<p>" Not exactly that, but something like it," was the
</p>
<p>reply ; and then the speaker looked on us with a scrutinizing
</p>
<p>glance, as if he hesitated to proceed. As for me, the reader
</p>
<p>may imagine my curiosity to know what he was driving at.
</p>
<p>All I did to lead him on was to let him understand that,
</p>
<p>although the octogenarian stood out against him, he would
</p>
<p>not find me invincibly opposed to his notions.
</p>

</p>
<p>a passion which, even when it encounters obstacles or conse
</p>
<p>quences apparently the most likely to check it, still rushes
</p>
<p>forward with undiminished audacity and blindness. What
</p>
<p>would become of it if every obstacle was removed and
</p>
<p>every untoward consequence was rendered impossible ? "
</p>
<p>" Had not David at least twenty wives ?" he replied.
</p>
<p>" Whenever he was smitten with the beauty of a daughter of
</p>
<p>Eve, did he not make her his concubine ? Would not any
</p>
<p>one who should now imitate him be regarded as the most
</p>
<p>abominable of libertines ? And yet is it not written that
</p>
<p>David was a man after God's own heart ? Other holy men
</p>
<p>had a greater number of women. Solomon is not blamed
</p>
<p>for having had a thousand, but only for having taken them
</p>
<p>from among the heathen, and for having been beguiled by
</p>
<p>them to worship their gods. Why, then, should it be a
</p>
<p>crime to know one woman, when in former times, notwith
</p>
<p>standing the oppression thence resulting for the woman,
</p>
<p>God was not offended with those who indulged so copiously
</p>
<p>in that respect ? "
</p>
<p>I will not repeat all he said on this subject, for it would
</p>
<p>be necessary to enter into a labyrinth of theological ques
</p>
<p>tions. But what strongly excited my attention was his
</p>
<p>mention of a Hospital of St. Roch, existing, he said, at
</p>
<p>Rome. The rules of the institution, which he explained to
</p>
<p>us in detail, are such as to secure any woman from the
</p>
<p>usual unpleasant consequences of female frailty. These
</p>
<p>regulations seemed fabulous to Father Fantini ; but the
</p>
<p>Jesuit insisted so strongly on the reality of what he had
</p>
<p>been telling us, that for my part I did not hesitate to believe
</p>
<p>him. He met all our objections without flinching.

<p>I myself was afterwards assailed with the same objec-
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 231
</p>
<p>tions in Switzerland, when I offered an explanation of the
</p>
<p>passage in my text wherein mention is made of a Hospital
</p>
<p>of St. Roch. Fortunately I was able to put them entirely
</p>
<p>aside by means of a testimony that leaves no grounds for
</p>
<p>suspicion. In the following passage, written by M. Poujoulat, that
</p>
<p>writer has unwittingly done me a great service :  *
</p>
<p>" One very admirable abode of charity is the arch-hospital
</p>
<p>of St. Roch, intended for pregnant women who wish to be
</p>
<p>delivered in secret. They are not asked either their names
</p>
<p>or their condition, and they may even keep their faces
</p>
<p>veiled during the whole time they are within the walls.
</p>
<p>Should one of them die, her name would not be inserted
</p>
<p>in any register, numbers being invariably used in the
</p>
<p>establishment instead of names. Young women, whose
</p>
<p>pregnancy, if known, would bring dishonour on themselves
</p>
<p>or their families, are received at St. Roch several months
</p>
<p>before their time, so as to prevent the shame and despair
</p>
<p>that might drive them to infanticide. The chaplains,
</p>
<p>physicians, midwives, and all who are employed in the
</p>
<p>establishment, are bound to strict secrecy, which is enjoined
</p>
<p>under the severest penalties ; whoevee should violate
</p>
<p>this law would be aeeaigned befoee the teibunal of
</p>
<p>the holy office. Every provision is made that nothing
</p>
<p>which occurs within St. Roch shall transpire out of doors.
</p>
<p>The arch-hospital is managed by pious widows. All
</p>
<p>strangers, be they who they may, are absolutely excluded ;
</p>
<p>none but those who are employed in the hospital are
</p>
<p>allowed to cross the threshold. After their confinement,

<p>the patients can leave the house at any hour of the night
</p>

<p>" What can be more generous, noble, and christian,
</p>
<p>than these pious cares to spread the cloak of pity over the
</p>
<p>errors of frailty ! "
</p>
<p>The suppression of foundling hospitals certainly cannot
</p>
<p>take place under existing circumstances without serious
</p>
<p>inconveniences ; before they could be dispensed with,
</p>
<p>nothing less would be requisite than a fundamental change
</p>
<p>in the system of society. As for the institution of St. Roch,
</p>
<p>there is, after all, nothing in it very generous or very
</p>
<p>christian. In what interest has it been founded? Who
</p>
<p>are the authors of its regulations ? They are an immense
</p>
<p>number of celibataries, who have but too strong an interest
</p>
<p>in concealing by any and every means the vast evils of a
</p>
<p>false celibacy. What is really surprising is, that those who
</p>
<p>profess themselves the guardians of the public morals, and
</p>
<p>who inveigh against vice and debauchery as a consequence
</p>
<p>of the incredulity of the age, should be the very persons
</p>
<p>who display such ingenuity in inventing the most efficacious
</p>
<p>means for screening the licentious from public observation.
</p>
<p>What a sublime effort of piety it is to rid oneself of every
</p>
<p>thorn, and to enjoy the perfume of the rose without fear, as
</p>
<p>the Jesuit expressed himself! That same cloak of pity,
</p>
<p>spread with pious care over the errors of frailty, would have
</p>
<p>been called an abominable invention, had it been woven by
</p>
<p>other hands.

<p>alluding to a great number of monks and priests whom he

<p>had long confessed, replied  " As for what you call the

<p>found it all rotten and worm-eaten : the worm was always

<p>" It is one," said the Jesuit, looking particularly at me,
</p>
<p>" that can be made to shine like the purest gold."
</p>
<p>When he was about to quit us, I asked his name. " Is
</p>
<p>it his Dame you ask?" said the old Capuchin; "but do
</p>
<p>you not know that a Jesuit of the superior grades, who is
</p>
<p>on a mission, must have at least as many different names as
</p>
<p>there are hours in the day ? What a child you are ! He
</p>
<p>has come to feel our pulses, and that is a reason the more
</p>
<p>why he should invent a name on the spot." Upon this,
</p>
<p>the Jesuit opened the door and left us, with a sardonic smile
</p>
<p>exclaiming, " It is no lying proverb that says, ' There is
</p>
<p>nothing simpler and slier than a Capuchin.' "
</p>
<p>" I know a truer one," retorted the old man, " and that
</p>
<p>is, 'It takes seven Capuchins to make a Jesuit.'" We
</p>
<p>parted with a hearty laugh on both sides.
</p>
<p>But to come to the fact I alluded to just now. The
</p>
<p>Rev. Mr. Hartley, an Anglican minister, to whom I had
</p>
<p>imparted the Secret Plan in Geneva, after having come to
</p>
<p>me three or four times to read it, told me he did not doubt
</p>
<p>its authenticity ; that to suppose it my own work would
</p>
<p>infer my possession of qualities and conditions of which I
</p>
<p>was entirely destitute ; but that he thought I had let

<p>myself be tempted to add to it the pages concerning

<p>celibacy, by way of a climax to all the rest. "This part
</p>
<p>of the work," he said, " does not appear to me to be
</p>
<p>credible." " So strongly," replied I, " do I share in your opinion
</p>
<p>as to its improbability, that I have been a hundred times
</p>
<p>tempted to suppress it. Had I invented the Secret Plan,
</p>
<p>I should never have ventured to go so far."
</p>
<p>I then narrated to him everything concerning the
</p>
<p>Hopital St. Roch. I could not enumerate all the objec
</p>
<p>tions with which he assailed me, and with such force as to
</p>
<p>silence me completely. There were moments, even, when
</p>
<p>I fancied I had been made the dupe of a forged tale ; and
</p>
<p>I was quite appalled when I contemplated the picture which
</p>
<p>my reverend friend drew of the consequences flowing from
</p>
<p>those regulations of the Hospital of St. Roch, which the
</p>
<p>Jesuit so much admired.
</p>
<p>The Anglican minister was not favourable to the publi
</p>
<p>cation of the Secret Plan. Though he believed that the
</p>
<p>tactics described in it were real, and was convinced that to
</p>
<p>them Jesuitism owes its most brilliant conquests, yet he too,
</p>
<p>like many others, thought it imprudent and dangerous to
</p>
<p>initiate the multitude into all these stratagems. He again
</p>
<p>attacked me keenly on the pages which he averred were

<p>my work.

</p>
<p>any man of sense believe that it could have remained

</p>
<p>explore and anatomise it more closely than the Romans
</p>
<p>themselves. Consider how much ridicule and opprobrium is
</p>
<p>cast on our clergy for having rejected celibacy ; what finer
</p>
<p>opportunity could they have had to lay bare, to the
</p>
<p>disgrace of the Romish clergy, the expedients by which
</p>
<p>they secure themselves against all scandal ? Yet not a
</p>
<p>word has ever been written to that effect. Had I no other
</p>
<p>argument than this, I should deem it invincible ; but there
</p>
<p>are others besides of a higher order. I know how institu
</p>
<p>tions, evidently bad, come to be submitted to through the
</p>
<p>force of centuries, heedlessness, the tyranny of habit, or
</p>
<p>potent interests. But most of them sprang up in barbarous
</p>
<p>times, and were formed little by little. Now, as for the
</p>
<p>regulations in question, if they existed, we should have to
</p>
<p>admit that they were the work of our own times, and that
</p>
<p>they had been planned, not piecemeal and gradually, but in
</p>
<p>one bulk, for the sole purpose of giving free course to the
</p>
<p>vices of the clergy ! And who are those who should have
</p>
<p>proposed to themselves such an aim ? Not one, or many
</p>
<p>priests, but the whole body of the prelates, with the pope
</p>
<p>at their head. I cannot bring myself to attribute to them
</p>
<p>such consummate depravity as this would infer. However
</p>
<p>I dislike Rome, I cannot possibly believe that a numerous
</p>
<p>body of men who respect themselves, who are watched by
</p>
<p>the public, and have formidable enemies, could conspire
</p>
<p>together to systematize the impunity of debauchery, and
</p>
<p>even take extraordinary pains to put it at its ease ! Why,

</p>
<p>The crimes of Rome are weighty enough without inventing
</p>
<p>others to charge her with. These objections stand like a

<p>wall of brass, which nothing can shake."
</p>
<p>Any one who had seen me would have been sure that
</p>
<p>my cause was lost. I really knew not what to say, so
</p>
<p>exceedingly strong did his arguments appear even in my
</p>
<p>own eyes. As for the pages of the Secret Plan that relate
</p>
<p>to celibacy, had the world argued against me, of course it
</p>
<p>could not have made me believe that a thing belonged to
</p>
<p>me which did not.
</p>
<p>Some months afterwards, when turning over several
</p>
<p>new works in a bookseller's, I lighted on M. Poujoulat's,
</p>
<p>and found in it the passage I have quoted. How great
</p>
<p>was my delight ! I hurried off instantly with the volume
</p>
<p>in my hand to Mr. Hartley, who was just returned from a
</p>
<p>journey to Nice. Before conquering him in my turn, I
</p>
<p>wished to resuscitate the question. He appeared vexed at
</p>
<p>my audacity, and pressed me with objections still more
</p>
<p>pointed than those I have already reported. I let him
</p>
<p>enjoy his triumph, and my defeat appeared consummated.
</p>
<p>Logic, common-sense, and rules, were all for him. Mean
</p>
<p>while, in order to make him fully persuaded of the credit
</p>
<p>due to the authority on which I was about to base my proof,
</p>
<p>I made him read certain passages in which M. Poujoulat
</p>
<p>speaks of his relations with Gregory XVI., his docility with
</p>
<p>regard to the censorship, and his unbounded zeal for the
</p>
<p>triumph of Catholicism ; after this, I laid before him the
</p>
<p>passage quoted above.
</p>
<p>He was stupified. He read it two or three times, and
</p>
<p>at last confessed that he was forced to yield to evidence,

</p>
<p>on me with great distrust. He frankly acknowledged his
</p>
<p>injustice, and exclaimed, " This Rome ! this Rome ! it
</p>
<p>bewilders the reason. We cannot apply to it any of the
</p>
<p>known and ordinary rules of judgment : it tramples on
</p>
<p>them all ; it makes real what seems impossible ; and we
</p>
<p>may well say of it that truth is stranger than fiction."
</p>
<p>One is fortunate when he can refute his antagonist's

<p>arguments in this manner. One plain fact suddenly

<p>demolished an immense fabric : the wall of brass fell to

<p>the ground.
</p>
<p>But do we not at this moment witness events, for good
</p>
<p>and for ill, which, if they had been predicted yesterday,

<p>would have been rejected as incredible ? A pope is intent

</p>
<p>seen and read the documents proving all this turpitude.
</p>
<p>Yet we are constrained to admit no less, now that
</p>
<p>M. Cretineau Joly comes forward with his proofs to
</p>
<p>establish this strange fact.
</p>
<p>" When I had finished," he says, " I stood aghast at my
</p>
<p>own work ; for above the throng of names that jostle
</p>
<p>together for mutual dishonour, there is one which the
</p>
<p>Apostolic See appeared to cover with its inviolability.
</p>
<p>Princes of the church, for whom I have long cherished a
</p>
<p>respectful affection, entreated me not to rend the veil that
</p>
<p>concealed such a pontificate from the world's eyes. The
</p>
<p>General of the Company of Jesus, who had so many strong
</p>
<p>motives for being interested in the discoveries I have made,
</p>
<p>added his entreaties to those of some cardinals. In the
</p>
<p>name of his order, and for the honour of the Holy See, he
</p>
<p>besought me, almost with tears in his eyes, to give up the
</p>
<p>publication of this history. Even the wish and authority
</p>
<p>of the sovereign pontiff, Pius IX., were invoked in the
</p>
<p>counsels and representations of which my work was tbe
</p>
<p>object. " To a Catholic, how painful it is to detect princes of
</p>
<p>the church in flagrant acts of lying and venality ; still more
</p>
<p>painful to see a sovereign pontiff timidly resisting the
</p>
<p>iniquity he encouraged by his ambition, and annihilating
</p>
<p>himself on the throne, when he had done so much to ascend
</p>
<p>it. But does not such a spectacle, which no doubt will
</p>
<p>never be repeated, does it not inspire a sentiment of sorrow
</p>
<p>which history cannot help recording ? Is not the crime of
</p>
<p>the supreme priest equal to the crimes of the whole people?
</p>
<p>Does it not surpass them in the eyes of the Eternal Judge?

<p>The moment is come to speak it to all. It will be sad

<p>and for the whole Catholic world." *
</p>
<p>We are free to admit everything except the tears and
</p>
<p>supplications of the General of the Jesuits. It was rather
</p>
<p>he, we think, who believed that the time was come for
</p>
<p>drawing from their concealment documents long collected,
</p>
<p>and that it was he who " excited the writer to unveil the
</p>
<p>mystery of iniquity," and to make known that when the
</p>
<p>Company was abolished, " then was seen the abomination in
</p>
<p>ihe temple.'' Vainly would M. Cretineau Joly put the
</p>
<p>order of Jesuits out of question in this matter ; it is a
</p>
<p>stratagem which we see through. It is to no purpose he
</p>
<p>exclaims, " I must boldly declare that there is not only
</p>
<p>want of agreement, but complete disagreement between
</p>
<p>the author and the Fathers of the Company of Jesus." f
</p>
<p>This is going too far, and pointing out the battery by dint of
</p>
<p>too much pains to mask it. His efforts to maintain that the
</p>
<p>original manuscripts did not come to him from the Jesuits,
</p>
<p>are equally unfortunate. Who more than the Jesuits could
</p>
<p>possess the art of insinuating themselves everywhere, in
</p>
<p>veigling, and employing thousands of agents all over Europe
</p>
<p>to get hold of secret papers carefully put away and kept in
</p>
<p>all the chanceries, and the most mysterious diplomatic
</p>
<p>correspondences ? For it is in these terms M. Cretineau
</p>
<p>himself characterizes the documents he has in his hands,

<p>and the almost insurmountable difficulties of getting

<p>possession of them. It is amazing and inexplicable that

<p>those who were the most implicated by these documents
</p>
<p>did not make haste to destroy them immediately after the
</p>
<p>conclave ; for whilst they existed, personages of the highest
</p>
<p>rank, including even a pope, were exposed to the danger of
</p>
<p>being rendered infamous in history. Here are two enigmas
</p>
<p>which shock the reason, and which it would be exceedingly
</p>
<p>difficult to admit if the fact were not indisputable.
</p>
<p>One is tempted to believe, from the manner in which
</p>
<p>M. Cretineau Joly defends himself, that far from its being
</p>
<p>his intention to prove that he does not derive all these
</p>
<p>original manuscripts from the Jesuits, it is, on the contrary,
</p>
<p>his aim to let that fact be understood ; for the argument he
</p>
<p>uses to put the Jesuits out of question, implicates them
</p>
<p>more than ever.
</p>
<p>"At what period, or by what mysterious ramifications,"
</p>
<p>he says, " could they have deceived or suborned all the
</p>
<p>ambassadors, all the conservators of the archives 1
</p>
<p>" No doubt," he says, speaking hypothetically of the
</p>
<p>Jesuits, " tbey have possessed these documents since an
</p>
<p>unascertained period ; why did they never make use of
</p>
<p>them during their suppression ?
</p>
<p>" The Jesuits, then, have not furnished me with any of
</p>
<p>these documents, for the very simple reason that such
</p>
<p>pieces could never have been in their archives. They
</p>
<p>have done all in their power to stop the work ; but they
</p>
<p>have failed, because I have thought that in conscience I

</p>
<p>Having given these proofs that he is not the " liege
</p>
<p>man of the Company," he is more happy in his replies to
</p>
<p>those who have attacked his book as a romance.
</p>
<p>"If," says he, "the letters of Bernis (one of the
</p>
<p>cardinals in the conclave) stood alone, without any other
</p>
<p>warrant than his word, we hold that doubt would be allow
</p>
<p>able, and we should doubt ; but it is not he alone who, for
</p>
<p>the amusement of his idle hours, invents all these events,
</p>
<p>histories, and simoniacal projects, of which he makes
</p>
<p>himself the echo, the accomplice, or the censor. Outside
</p>
<p>the conclave intrigue marches with head erect, backed by
</p>
<p>ministers and ambassadors whose correspondence strikingly
</p>
<p>coincides with the romance which some would fain attribute
</p>
<p>to the cardinal. But these diplomatic correspondences
</p>
<p>show as much as possible a common bond and centre ; they
</p>
<p>dovetail, in the cabinets of Versailles, Vienna, Madrid,
</p>
<p>Naples, and Lisbon, with other dispatches which contain

<p>the same plans and avowals.

<p>" The simoniacal conspiracy is manieest. Bernis

<p>and Cardinal Orsini repudiate it at first, but afterwards
</p>
<p>they join in it ; and if this immense process were tried

<p>before a jury of bishops, or merely of upright men, do you
</p>
<p>suppose that after examination of the documents cited in

</p>
<p>notwithstanding all he has been saying, "it never entered
</p>
<p>his thoughts to invalidate the election of Ganganelli." His
</p>
<p>defence is nothing but a series of legerdemain, of subtilties
</p>
<p>and sophisms, denying on the one hand what he affirms
</p>
<p>on the other. But indeed the cause he defends makes all
</p>
<p>these contradictions inevitable.
</p>
<p>" In my eyes," he says, " and by the documents I have
</p>
<p>published, Pope Clement XIV. (Ganganelli) has never been
</p>
<p>sullied with the crime of simony, properly so called. Ambition
</p>
<p>led him astray. A victim to the position in which he placed
</p>
<p>himself, he has incurred the eulogy of the enemies of unity
</p>
<p> a eulogy which for a priest, a bishop, above all for a
</p>
<p>pope, acting in the plenitude of his apostolic authority, is
</p>
<p>the most disgraceful of condemnations. This pope, whose
</p>
<p>name becomes popular only at moments when the enemy's

</p>
<p>the pity due to his private virtues and his misfortunes.
</p>
<p>There is a wide difference between this sentiment and
</p>
<p>desertion of the cause of justice. The memory of
</p>
<p>Clement XIV. had always been attacked and extolled
</p>
<p>without convincing proofs. Now, public opinion may, in
</p>
<p>safety of conscience, hear and determine this great suit.
</p>
<p>When the time shall have come, I will speak out the rest.

</p>
<p>clave. Ganganelli was lured away by ambition beyond his
</p>
<p>duties and his most secret wishes : he desired the papacy,
</p>
<p>thinking perhaps that his heart was set on a work beneficial
</p>
<p>to Christendom ; he entered into a sort of an engagement.
</p>
<p>If this does not constitute simony  and we are firmly
</p>
<p>persuaded that it does not  let us add, nevertheless, that
</p>
<p>such a manner of acting in a prince of the church borders
</p>
<p>very closely on scandal and corruption. Furthermore let
</p>
<p>us add, that the words of the cordelier to Cardinal
</p>
<p>Castelli are an evidence of knavery which everybody will
</p>
<p>condemn."* The last lines of this fragment are glaringly inconsistent
</p>
<p>with the first ; concession follows concession, until at last
</p>
<p>we have it admitted that Ganganelli's conduct borders very
</p>
<p>closely on scandal and corruption, and that he displays
</p>
<p>knavery. Would the reader have more ? The same writer
</p>
<p>beholds in him only "a pope who made cunning his ladder."
</p>
<p>And this he calls a sort of an engagement. There is not
</p>
<p>even a trace of simony, he says. Wherefore, then, such
</p>
<p>bitter reproaches, as though he had been the worst of
</p>
<p>popes ? If he was under no formal and explicit engagement,
</p>
<p>then his brief was his free act and deed ; and in suppressing
</p>
<p>the Jesuits, he was really actuated by the grave and impera
</p>
<p>tive motives he alleges. The abolition was, therefore, the
</p>
<p>work of five years' reflection, and of the conviction arrived
</p>
<p>at by this pope, that the order was dangerous to the church,
</p>
<p>and would finally hurry it to destruction. Ganganelli
</p>
<p>would thus be the most innocent of all concerned, and
</p>

<p>infamous manoeuvres. The venal compact is, nevertheless,
</p>
<p>proved in the most irrefragable manner: it is the very basis
</p>
<p>of the book, and that book is nugatory if Clement XIV.
</p>
<p>was not a party to the compact. Now, the words of the
</p>
<p>same writer, on which he rests all the importance of
</p>
<p>his book, are clear and precise, and they do implicate
</p>
<p>Ganganelli. " The bargain," he says, " which gave him to the
</p>
<p>church, has hitherto been always denied by the Jesuits and
</p>
<p>by several annalists. We have cast an unexpected light on
</p>
<p>this point ; with the documents before us, which we have
</p>
<p>exhumed, doubt is no longer possible." *
</p>
<p>These discoveries have appeared so strange and incredi
</p>
<p>ble, that some have even ventured to contest their validity ;
</p>
<p>others on all hands demand the complete publication of the
</p>
<p>original manuscripts.
</p>
<p>I will now mention a curious specimen of the disputes
</p>
<p>between the cardinals in this conclave into which we have
</p>
<p>been enabled to peep. The prelate attacked was one of
</p>
<p>Voltaire's friends.
</p>
<p>" Overwhelmed with reproaches, Bernis tried to recover
</p>
<p>his position by starting personal considerations, and he said,
</p>
<p>' Equality ought to prevail among us ; we are all here by
</p>
<p>the same right and title.' Whereupon old Alexander
</p>
<p>Albani, raising his red cardinal's hat, forcibly exclaimed,
</p>
<p>' No, Eminence, we are not all here by the same right and
</p>
<p>title ; for it was not a courtesan that placed this hat on
</p>
<p>my head.'

<p>Bernis. The allusion told." *
</p>
<p>Such a cardinal knew too well with whom he had to do
</p>
<p>not to be able to retort with the same force. But what is
</p>
<p>really astonishing is, that although it be confessed that the
</p>
<p>conclave was a downright mart, wherein the movement of
</p>
<p>the market from hour to hour, and the price current of
</p>
<p>consciences were noted and recorded  and although, in
</p>
<p>spite of all efforts to disguise the truth, it is evident that
</p>
<p>such of the cardinals as sided with the Jesuits were also the
</p>
<p>subjects of similar temptations  notwithstanding all this,
</p>
<p>M. Cretineau Joly has yet written such words as these':
</p>
<p>" We may assert, that at no time did the Sacred College
</p>
<p>consist of more pious and edifying members. The excep
</p>
<p>tions in this respect are few." f
</p>
<p>The author is deliberately resolved on heaping infamy
</p>
<p>upon this conclave, and at the very same time proving its
</p>
<p>almost spotless innocence.
</p>
<p>If still stronger proofs are required that Ganganelli
</p>
<p>must have consented, must have owned accomplices, and
</p>
<p>bound himself by promises, here, according to the same
</p>
<p>writer, is what happened immediately upon the pope's
</p>
<p>accession. " The distribution of the high functions of the Roman
</p>
<p>court is made by the diplomatic body. Pagliarini, the
</p>
<p>bookseller, who, under the protection of Pombal, inundated
</p>
<p>Europe und Rome itself with his pamphlets against the

</p>
<p>Thus Pombal ennobled him whom Clement XIII. had con
</p>
<p>demned to the galleys, and he asked for a cardinal's hat for
</p>
<p>his brother. Every one strove to secure an equivalent for
</p>
<p>the part he had taken in Ganganelli's nomination ; every
</p>
<p>one insisted on high office, and trafficked on his suffrage to
</p>
<p>secure a hold on the helm of the church. One would have
</p>
<p>imagined that the constitutional system had invaded the
</p>
<p>conclave, such was the throng of craving intriguers and
</p>
<p>proteges. It was the day of self-seeking, the day of
</p>
<p>wages." *
</p>
<p>The elevation of popes by corrupt influences, and even
</p>
<p>by crime, is no new thing. Although in times of censorship
</p>
<p>and inquisition, history could not know or relate everything,
</p>
<p>yet it has recorded scandals, trafficking and bargains,
</p>
<p>enough to hinder our being surprised at anything. Still
</p>
<p>they would have us believe that the Holy Spirit always
</p>
<p>presides at the elections of the Roman pontiffs ; only, those
</p>
<p>who thus speak are forced to own that, whereas it formerly
</p>
<p>spoke by the lips of the clergy and the people, some cardi
</p>
<p>nals have since succeeded in monopolizing it.
</p>
<p>In fine, never could one have believed, never could one
</p>
<p>have dared to suspect, that so many ambassadors, ministers,
</p>
<p>princes, and cardinals, could have concerted together, with
</p>
<p>out the least shame, to commit the greatest of sacrileges.
</p>
<p>The conclave in which this took place would still to this
</p>
<p>hour be regarded as one of the most edifying, were it not
</p>
<p>that from it issued the pope who abolished the order of the

</p>
<p>tion should be brought in play. Nothing less was requisite
</p>
<p>than the interest of such a corporation as that of the
</p>
<p>Jesuits, in order that the most profound secrets should be
</p>
<p>plucked from the archives of all the courts of Europe, no
</p>
<p>one knows how. I repeat, that if all had been said without
</p>
<p>that mass of proofs which are ready to be produced, the
</p>
<p>objections would have appeared insurmountable.
</p>
<p>One word more, while we are on the subject, as to the
</p>
<p>strange work of an advocate of the Company of Jesus.
</p>
<p>" Full of reverence for the pontifical authority," says
</p>
<p>M. Cretineau Joly, "we do not pronounce judgment on an
</p>
<p>act that emanated from the apostolic chair." *
</p>
<p>What, you do not pronounce judgment? Your humility
</p>
<p>and reverence are but contempt. You have declared null
</p>
<p>and void the suppressing brief, and you abstain from
</p>
<p>judging ? Can any condemnation be stronger ? But let
</p>
<p>that pass.
</p>
<p>If there be any fact beyond question, it is that Gan
</p>
<p>ganelli's death was most horrible, that the poison infiltrated
</p>
<p>into his very bones had dissolved every part of his body,
</p>
<p>so that all who saw him were terror-stricken. It is
</p>
<p>known, through the testimony of others beside Cardinal
</p>
<p>Bernis, " that from the day of his elevation he was afraid
</p>
<p>of dying by poison." Now the apologist of the Jesuits,
</p>
<p>taking upon himself to be the biographer of Clement
</p>
<p>XIV., makes haste to pass over this perilous subject. He
</p>
<p>makes scarcely any account of the most ascertained facts,
</p>
<p>but takes pleasure in exhibiting the pontiff as a prey to the

<p>most poignant agonies of remorse, shrieking out the words,
</p>
<p>" O God, I am damned ! Hell will be my portion. There
</p>
<p>is no remedy left !" He adds, that the pope soon after his
</p>
<p>elevation became insane. " His insanity began," says he,
</p>
<p>"on the day he ratified the suppression of the Jesuits!"*
</p>
<p>So the pope who gave audience to a great number of per
</p>
<p>sons, whose language excited admiration, and who for
</p>
<p>five years studied the question of the Jesuits, was only a
</p>
<p>madman ! " In the history of the sovereign pontiffs,"
</p>
<p>concludes the avenger of the Jesuits, " he is the first and
</p>
<p>only one who suffered this degradation of humanity."
</p>
<p>Nothing less would have been an adequate punishment for
</p>
<p>the greatest of crimes.
</p>
<p>But now it is the denouement, which, above all things,
</p>
<p>is worth knowing. It was requisite to renovate the good
</p>
<p>name of Ganganelli, and it belonged to the Jesuits to do
</p>
<p>this for their own greater glory. The expedient employed
</p>
<p>for this purpose is not new ; recourse is had to miracle, and
</p>
<p>a legend is invented.
</p>
<p>Saint Alfonso Signori has been canonised in these latter
</p>
<p>days. I have been able closely to observe how this sort of
</p>
<p>affairs is managed. The theologian Guala, of whom I
</p>
<p>have already spoken, was among the most active on the
</p>
<p>occasion, and spared no intrigues or efforts towards bringing
</p>
<p>about the canonisation. Could this great supporter of the
</p>
<p>Jesuits abstain from taking part with many others in rear
</p>
<p>ing an altar to one of the greatest friends of the Company ?
</p>
<p>The new saint was bishop in one of the cities of Sicily

<p>when Ganganelli died. His name was used, and the story

</p>
<p>A third of a century before the French Revolution, a
</p>
<p>vast change was taking place, as in our day, in the minds
</p>
<p>of men. Everything was preparing for a decisive crisis.
</p>
<p>Then, as now, the Jesuits, in their system of teaching,
</p>
<p>represented the most obstinate immobility, and the most
</p>
<p>retrograde doctrines. Men craved for more air, light, and
</p>
<p>life ; and the Jesuits and their adherents everywhere strove
</p>
<p>to stifle these aspirations.
</p>
<p>" They held in their hands," the panegyrist himself
</p>
<p>avows it, " the future generations, and they acted as a clog

<p>most formidable rampart of Catholic principles. It was

<p>over the bodies of the grenadiers of the church."*
</p>
<p>Great, however, is the difference between those times
</p>
<p>and ours. Then the upper classes, intoxicated with
</p>
<p>philosophy, and knowing by experience what were the
</p>
<p>designs of the Jesuits, spared no efforts for the abolition of
</p>
<p>the order. But a pope alone could accomplish their
</p>
<p>wishes. Now the Company was so identified with Rome,
</p>
<p>and so indispensable to it, that nothing short of the combined
</p>
<p>strength of the greatest powers could sever the connection.
</p>
<p>Even this was not enough ; they had already demanded this
</p>
<p>abolition without success. Two preceding popes had begun
</p>
<p>by refusing, and when at last they had declared their
</p>
<p>design to suppress the Jesuits, death had soon cut short
</p>
<p>their projects. Success was, therefore, believed to be
</p>
<p>impossible, except by means of a pope created by the princes
</p>
<p>themselves, and thereby seriously compromised. Now to
</p>
<p>obtain such a pope it was necessary to manoeuvre and use
</p>
<p>intrigues as potent as those employed by the Jesuits. The
</p>
<p>cells of the Vatican were conquered by a hostile spirit  by
</p>
<p>the very spirit of the encyclopedists which had become
</p>
<p>the possessor of thrones. It was a duel to the death, but
</p>
<p>the younger combatant was at last the victor. There
</p>
<p>issued from the conclave a chief of the church better
</p>
<p>adapted to the spirit of the age, and acquainted with its
</p>
<p>requirements. And yet he took good care not to abolish
</p>
<p>the Company forthwith ; he waited, and postponed the
</p>
<p>matter even for several years. He wished, before he struck

<p>the blow, to collect proofs of extreme weight, and formid-

<p>able by their numbers ; but it turned out, as he had
</p>
<p>predicted, that in signing the brief which suppressed the
</p>
<p>Jesuits, he signed his own death-warrant.
</p>
<p>As for all those monarchs, ministers, and diplomatists,
</p>
<p>who knew no rest until the abolition took place, fortunately
</p>
<p>they did not perceive what would be its remote consequences.
</p>
<p>They rejoiced to see that Rome was about to lose her most
</p>
<p>valiant and able soldiers. Remembering how their ances
</p>
<p>tors had humbled themselves, in the dust before her, and let
</p>
<p>themselves be beaten with rods, they believed that they
</p>
<p>were at last sole masters, that the tables would be turned,
</p>
<p>that the clergy would become their tools, and receive their
</p>
<p>orders. On either side there was no question of the
</p>
<p>people ; it was regarded as nothing. But unconsciously they
</p>
<p>worked for its advantage, and prepared the way for its
</p>
<p>advancement, whether by the new philosophic ideas with
</p>
<p>which they inundated Europe, or by overthrowing the
</p>
<p>strongest bulwark that restrained it. They could not
</p>
<p>fail themselves to be swept away by the bursting flood.
</p>
<p>Such blindness was providential.
</p>
<p>" Rome discharged her best soldiery," observes M.
</p>
<p>Cretineau, " on the very eve of the day on which the Holy

<p>See was about to be attacked on all points simultaneously.
</p>
<p>The Jesuits, while they obeyed the pontifical brief, thought
</p>
<p>it was their duty not to desert the post entrusted to their
</p>
<p>guard."* Here was a model of perfect submission ! The Jesuits

<p>An immense revolution had convulsed the world;

<p>Napoleon had in vain endeavoured to turn it to his own

<p>profit ; but the same ideas which had raised him so high
</p>
<p>had ceased to support him when they had been betrayed

<p>and put in peril, and so he was plunged living into the
</p>
<p>abyss. This terrible lesson, like many others, taught
</p>
<p>nothing to those who came from exile to resume the sceptre.
</p>
<p>The volcano of the new ideas did but smoulder ; the
</p>
<p>Jesuits persuaded the powers that they had the means and
</p>
<p>the strength to extinguish it. All that was requisite was
</p>
<p>that they should have the young generation in their hands.
</p>
<p>They imagined that, as in past times, they should succeed
</p>
<p>in making God's name a means of propping up the most
</p>
<p>intolerable abuses and the most iniquitous privileges. But
</p>
<p>this insensate project was met by a proportionate reaction ;
</p>
<p>the ideas of progression and freedom would not submit to be
</p>
<p>stifled, and they resumed the conflict  a conflict which

<p>M. Cretineau calls an impious rebellion, a work of perfidy

<p>and imposture.

</p>
<p>Although the thing is known, it is not amiss to recollect
</p>
<p>what he means by the truth, and by conspiring against it.
</p>
<p>It is important to institute a comparison between the epoch
</p>
<p>of which we are speaking and our own ; between the undis
</p>
<p>guised language then held by the upholders of the old
</p>
<p>system of society, and that which their successors now hold.
</p>
<p>At the very time when the Jesuits were occupied with the
</p>
<p>Secret Plan, M. de Remusat thus expressed himself: 
</p>
<p>" The new year, or 1824. Questions of a ponderer.
</p>
<p>" A grand project occupies the minds of the mighty of

<p>the Old World. They would fain bring back the New
</p>
<p>World to its infant state, and strangle it in its cradle in
</p>
<p>the swaddling-clothes in which it has been so long kept.
</p>
<p>The age has been accused, condemned, and anathematised
</p>
<p>by them. Crowned Europe has conceived the design of
</p>
<p>proving to the human race that it is wrong to be what it is ;
</p>
<p>to time that it ought not to destroy ; to the present that it

<p>ought to be the past. And one would almost say that this
</p>
<p>strange enterprise is beginning to succeed ; one would say
</p>
<p>so, were one to judge from the stifled wail of the oppressed.

<p>faces pale beneath the diadems, and anxious eyes incessantly

<p>The same writer thus describes the system with which
</p>
<p>it was sought to innoculate France in those days : 
</p>
<p>" Passive obedience, unlimited submission, in one word,
</p>
<p>despotism, were pleaded with the best faith in the world.
</p>
<p>Fear and flattery did not neglect so fair an opportunity to
</p>
<p>speak like good faith. Never was it more easy to bend
</p>
<p>without degradation, to be frail without shame ; the slave of
</p>
<p>arbitrary power became the friend of order ; the absence of
</p>
<p>every original, or, merely independent idea, was preached up
</p>
<p>under the name of good sense ; we were taught to respect
</p>
<p>even error, and to regard enlightenment as an abuse of
</p>
<p>thought. Thus served at once by faith and hypocrisy,
</p>
<p>leading in its train all the most heterogeneous prejudices,
</p>
<p>subduing the minds of men by admiration, their hearts by
</p>
<p>lassitude, their characters by fear, the genius of absolute
</p>
<p>power set about re-erecting its throne by heaping up 'the

<p>ruins of the old regime on the foundations laid by the

</p>
<p>as though enough had not already been done to render it
</p>
<p>odious by all the oppressions attempted in its sacred name.
</p>
<p>A committee was organised. The Jesuits, who had no
</p>
<p>doubt suggested it, were its managing advisers. The Holy

<p>Alliance supported it. Its affiliations ramified through all
</p>
<p>countries of Europe. M. Capefigue, as quoted by M.

</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 255
</p>
<p>Rochefoucault Doudeauville there was formed in Paris a
</p>
<p>central congregation, the statutes of which were simple at
</p>
<p>first, and had for their object the propagation of religious
</p>
<p>and monarchial ideas. The congregation received every
</p>
<p>Catholic who was presented by two of its members ; it was
</p>
<p>to extend to the schools and educational institutions, and,
</p>
<p>above all things, it was to lay hold on youth. When a
</p>
<p>young man wished to enter the association, his proposers
</p>
<p>were asked what influence he would exercise. If he was
</p>
<p>professor or member of a college, it was made a condition
</p>
<p>that he should propagate the good principles among the
</p>
<p>pupils. If he had fortune or high station, he engaged in
</p>
<p>like manner to employ them for the defence of religion and
</p>
<p>monarchy. Meetings were held twice a-week for prayer,
</p>
<p>innocent games, particularly billiards, and to report progress.
</p>
<p>Every Sunday the Abbe Freyssinous preached before
</p>
<p>a numerous audience, and waged war upon philosophy and
</p>
<p>the age in his elegantly composed sermons. It was against
</p>
<p>Gibbon and Voltaire that M. Freyssinous strove with much
</p>
<p>more pomp than point ; and he never failed to exhibit in
</p>
<p>favourable contrast the then present times, and to commend
</p>
<p>the beneficent influence of the clergy and of religion, and
</p>
<p>the necessity of strengthening the altar and the throne.
</p>
<p>These sermons were well attended. The politicians of the
</p>
<p>royalist party, some of them epicureans and unbelievers,
</p>
<p>were assiduous hearers of the abbe. It was a way of
</p>
<p>putting one's self in a good light. The congregation had
</p>
<p>branches in the provinces. In those days there was a
</p>
<p>rage for obtaining admission into the congregation,

</p>
<p>and the reason of this was simple :  there was no having
</p>
<p>256 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>powerful patronage or lucrative places unless one was a
</p>
<p>member."* " Such," says the advocate of Jesuitism, disdainfully
</p>
<p>resuming the discourse after this quotation, " such is the
</p>
<p>origin of the occult power so gratuitously attributed to the
</p>
<p>congregation. That power has existed, it has been
</p>
<p>exercised, but absolutely apart from, and independently of
</p>
<p>the congregation. The royalist coteries concealed their
</p>
<p>political manoeuvres under its name ; the liberal party
</p>
<p>seized upon that name to frighten France with the noise it
</p>
<p>wanted to make. The enemies of the church and the
</p>
<p>monarchy admirably calculated their blows ; they depopu-
</p>
<p>larised the royalists, and hung a cloak of hypocrisy on the
</p>
<p>shoulders of Christians. Yet all this was but a part of
</p>
<p>what was to be done. They annihilated the present gener
</p>
<p>ation, but the grand thing was to kill the future. "f As for
</p>
<p>the Jesuits, it is a great mistake to suppose that at that
</p>
<p>period they concerned themselves about anything else than
</p>
<p>the interests of religion. They reorganised their houses,
</p>
<p>and founded new ones with purely pious views, that
</p>
<p>was all.
</p>
<p>The Bourbons, however, who had put themselves in
</p>
<p>the hands of the Jesuits, paid dearly for their excessive
</p>
<p>complaisance. The sun of July forced their evil counsellors
</p>
<p>to keep themselves concealed for a while ; but by degrees,
</p>
<p>as the bright luminary grew dim, they came forth again,
</p>
<p>and renewed the struggle, but in a reversed manner. For

<p>OF THE JESUITS. 257
</p>
<p>now the clergy, finding themselves compelled to fight against
</p>
<p>authority, yet unwilling frankly to embrace liberty, adopted
</p>
<p>that Machiavellic attitude which it is partly the object of
</p>
<p>the second portion of this work to make known. Thus we
</p>
<p>can account for the embarrassments and the contradictions
</p>
<p>of their apologists.
</p>
<p>Many persons have inveighed against Eugene Sue for
</p>
<p>having dared to personify the Jesuitic genius in Rodin.
</p>
<p>They could not bring themselves to believe that a consider
</p>
<p>able number of men, and those, too, men invested with a
</p>
<p>religious character, could have concerted together to wear
</p>
<p>all sorts of masks and play all sorts of parts, in order to
</p>
<p>secure the services of all sorts of individuals for a work
</p>
<p>which every one would abhor if he knew its aim and
</p>
<p>scope. This system of graduated fraud, which it has been
</p>
<p>thought unjust to attribute to the majority of the Jesuits,
</p>
<p>have I not proved that it is fair to impute it to numerous
</p>
<p>writers, to preachers, and to a large portion of the upper
</p>
<p>clergy ? Can there be a doubt that there exists among
</p>
<p>them a close compact, and a well understood mot d'ordre,
</p>
<p>to mystify not only Europe but the whole world ?
</p>
<p>XIV.
</p>
<p>We have sought to open the eyes of persons who may in
</p>
<p>good faith be or become accomplices, beguiled by artifices
</p>
<p>which often impose on the most adroit. We believe we
</p>
<p>have cast a flood of light into the theocratic sanctuary, and
</p>
<p>convinced the most obstinate that the dogma of suffocation

</p>
<p>receive there divine honours, and that at this day the spirit
</p>
<p>of fraud, deprived of its old weapons, desperately defends its
</p>
<p>threatened empire by base sophisms and stratagems. Is it
</p>
<p>not time to purge the church from such foul impurities ?
</p>
<p>But if this radical and divine reform proceeds not from
</p>
<p>Pius IX., if he lends an ear to those whose interest it is to
</p>
<p>turn him aside from the sublime task to which Providence
</p>
<p>invites him, and urge him upon the same erroneous courses
</p>
<p>as his predecessors, still the first steps he has taken will
</p>
<p>have immense results in spite of him and against him.
</p>
<p>The Jesuits, as we have seen, have commissioned one
</p>
<p>of their liegemen to write the life of Ganganelli, in order to
</p>
<p>dismay and stop Pius IX. The dedication of the work is
</p>
<p>implied in this epigraph, A bon entendeur demimot, "A hint
</p>
<p>for one who can take it."
</p>
<p>After all, if, as some begin to fear, the reforms of
</p>
<p>Pius IX. are to be nothing but administrative ameliora
</p>
<p>tions, and if Rome refuse to institute a religious renovation
</p>
<p>which is imperatively demanded by our epoch, we possess
</p>
<p>the means of forcing the Vatican to break silence, and
</p>
<p>acknowledge, as evangelical, doctrines adequate to the reach
</p>
<p>and dignity of modern thought. The documents sent
</p>
<p>forth by the Roman presses, to which we here allude, have
</p>
<p>been stamped by Catholic authority with all possible marks
</p>
<p>of approbation. The following is an epitome of the principles thus
</p>
<p>solemnly recognised as having been primitively admitted by
</p>
<p>the church :  The people is sovereign ; it is the sole source
</p>
<p>of all authority; every government which does not submit
</p>
<p>its deliberations and its acts to the controul of the people is

</p>
<p>anti-christian. It follows thence that theocracy is convicted
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 259
</p>
<p>of rebellion. In fact, it is depicted in colours as severe as
</p>
<p>those which its most implacable enemies have employed to
</p>
<p>hold it up to execration. It would be impossible to prefer
</p>
<p>against it a more terrible bill of indictment, backed by a
</p>
<p>more overwhelming mass of decisive proofs. Its own
</p>
<p>organs confidentially predict to it that the impatient peoples
</p>
<p>will be driven to shake off an intolerable tyranny, if they
</p>
<p>despair of seeing it reformed ; and they remind it of the
</p>
<p>mission it ought to have accomplished, and which consisted
</p>
<p>in reconciling and uniting men by love and justice, prevent
</p>
<p>ing their sufferings by an equal partition of burthens,
</p>
<p>bestowing its just remuneration on labour, and guaranteeing
</p>
<p>a real independence to each individual. Instead of this,
</p>
<p>the most formal avowal is made that this hierarchy, devoured
</p>
<p>with pride, drunk with pomp, enslaved to its own exclusive
</p>
<p>interests, has given itself out for infallible, not being so ;
</p>
<p>that it has renounced the spirit of Christ, and would neither
</p>
<p>itself penetrate it, nor suffer others to do so. Therefore
</p>
<p>it is, that by the same hands is delivered to us the key of
</p>
<p>initiation into every evangelical work ; the true sense of
</p>
<p>dogmas is unveiled ; we now know what we are to think
</p>
<p>of miracles ; reason and faith are astonished that a mis
</p>
<p>understanding should so long have sundered them. It is
</p>
<p>said again and again in the documents we are speaking of
</p>
<p>that the reign of the dead letter must be abolished, for, as
</p>
<p>St. Paul says, " the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life;"
</p>
<p>and the same apostle tells us that the worship which is not
</p>
<p>rational is not christian.
</p>
<p>We venture to affirm, that the instructions, of which I
</p>
<p>merely state the heads, are more than sufficient to justify

<p>and call forth the largest and most radical reforms in the
</p>
<p>260 SECEET PLAN
</p>
<p>religious and the political world, and in the whole organisa
</p>
<p>tion of society. They emancipate the spirit of the Gospel
</p>
<p>from the prison of a fosilised religion.
</p>
<p>Did I not possess these weapons of proof, I should
</p>
<p>perhaps have been forced to abstain from publishing the
</p>
<p>Secret Plan. Those who may remain incredulous as regards
</p>
<p>it, will be compelled, by irrefutable proofs, to admit a far
</p>
<p>more extraordinary fact, authenticated by documents that
</p>
<p>will silence all the cavillings of self-interest.
</p>
<p>The fact, which I will make known in a special publica
</p>
<p>tion, concerns the seventeenth century and a part of the
</p>
<p>eighteenth. I will demonstrate that Voltairianism prevailed
</p>
<p>in Italy during a whole century before Voltaire ; that those
</p>
<p>who attacked mysteries and dogmas with language and
</p>
<p>sarcasms like his, were not libertines repudiated and con
</p>
<p>demned by the religious authority, or a handful of savans
</p>
<p>whose incredulity was confined to the circle of the cultivated
</p>
<p>class ; but that the attack on the foundations of religion
</p>
<p>and morality was made in the very churches, from the
</p>
<p>pulpit, and by numerous preachers ; that the numbers who
</p>
<p>flocked to hear them were immense, and that they enjoyed
</p>
<p>the countenance of the bishops and prelates. This horrible
</p>
<p>disorder was practised in the most celebrated churches of
</p>
<p>Rome ; it resisted the few feeble efforts made to put it
</p>
<p>down, and was still in existence when Voltaire appeared.
</p>
<p>The sacred buildings rang with loud shouts of laughter in
</p>
<p>approval of the most shameless commentaries. The acts
</p>
<p>of the patriarchs were held up to ridicule ; the Song of
</p>
<p>Songs afforded an ample theme for obscene jesting ; the
</p>
<p>visions of the prophets were turned into derision, and

<p>themselves treated as addle-headed and delirious. The
</p>
<p>OF THE JESUITS. 261
</p>
<p>Apostles were not spared, and it was taught that every
</p>
<p>thing concerning them was mere fable. Finally, Christ
</p>
<p>himself was outraged worse than he had ever been by
</p>
<p>his most rancorous enemies, and was accused of criminal
</p>
<p>intercourse with the Magdalen, the woman taken in adul
</p>
<p>tery, and the woman of Samaria. Thus was absolute
</p>
<p>irreligion preached, and for so long a time did this poison
</p>
<p>flow from the pulpits. The Bible was scoffed at, and
</p>
<p>Christianity likened to a mythology
</p>
<p>My greatest strength has been derived from the docu
</p>
<p>ments I have briefly alluded to ; and but for them I should
</p>
<p>have succumbed beneath the force of Dante's apothegm,
</p>
<p>which many a time recurs to my mind :  " A man should
</p>
<p>always beware of uttering a truth which has all the aspect
</p>
<p>of a lie." But as I could count on such a revelation, a
</p>
<p>thousand times stranger than the one I myself have just
</p>
<p>made, I hesitated no longer, being convinced that in our
</p>
<p>days, more than ever, these words of Jesus must be fulfilled,
</p>
<p>" There is nothing hidden that shall not be brought
</p>
<p>to light."
</p>
