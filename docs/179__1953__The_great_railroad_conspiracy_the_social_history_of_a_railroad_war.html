<p>AND CRAWFORDSVILLE, INDIANA
</p>
<p>/^/, 73
</p>
<p>'^' 'y PREFACE
</p>
<p>This is a tale of war, a railroad war, such as flared up in the United
</p>
<p>States in many places during the nineteenth century, when rail-
</p>
<p>roads were new and fearsome things. The field of battle was the
</p>
<p>young state of Michigan about one hundred years ago, and the
</p>
<p>combatants were farmers and the biggest railroad in the state.
</p>
<p>Violence, arson, intrigue, money, and public opinion were the
</p>
<p>weapons; life, liberty, and property were the goals that drove men
</p>
<p>on in this dramatic conflict that stirred the state from lake to lake.
</p>
<p>The great railroad conspiracy, as this war came to be known
</p>
<p>locally, has never been truly celebrated in story. The extant ac-
</p>
<p>counts are partial in every sense of the word and, with few excep-
</p>
<p>tions, give only the official version. The story is worth retelling, if
</p>
<p>only the more firmly to establish the facts and present a more rea-
</p>
<p>sonable approximation of the truth.
</p>
<p>The purpose of this book, however, goes beyond historical ac-
</p>
<p>curacy and dramatic interest. If only these had been the aims, they
</p>
<p>could have been realized in much fewer words. The story has been
</p>
<p>told, rather, in a large way in order to give a picture of an im-
</p>
<p>portant phase of American life, of a young and rapidly growing
</p>
<p>community of the West of the 1850's, but one remove from the
</p>
<p>frontier. The bare outlines have been filled in, the thread of the
</p>
<p>conflict has been followed into its social, political, and economic
</p>
<p>ramifications. The narrative of events has been used as a vehicle
</p>
<p>for presenting something of the social history of a community
</p>
<p>Tj which was certainly not unique in the development of this country.
</p>
<p>7^ The result, it is hoped, is a broad and vivid account of what
</p>
<p>^ Americans were like in the long process of becoming what they are.
</p>
<p>On one level, this is a study of the behavior and feelings of Amer-
</p>
<p>"^ icans, at home, in business, at the crossroads tavern, in court, and
</p>
<p>^ in politics. It is a case history of democracy, illustrating the strains
</p>
<p>of our political development at the grass roots. Its themes are
</p>
<p>^j-^merican frontier individualism exploding into violence and

</p>
<p>agrarian enterprise clashing with an expanding business dynamic.
</p>
<p>The flavor of the era is sustained by using as far as possible the
</p>
<p>spoken language of the time and place, from the salty vernacular
</p>
<p>to polished prose. Here, in short, is a snapshot of mid-nineteenth
</p>
<p>century America when it was not posing for a textbook illustration
</p>
<p>against a backdrop of quaint propriety.
</p>
<p>More particularly, the book spells out in one state the conflict of
</p>
<p>the farmers and the railroads years before the Granger agitation
</p>
<p>roiled the Midwest scene. It is a good example of a pre-Civil War
</p>
<p>antirailroad movement, a phenomenon often neglected by Amer-
</p>
<p>ican historians. These early struggles may have been only the
</p>
<p>inchoate stirrings of agrarian sentiment against the new public
</p>
<p>carriers, but they formed the tradition out of which the agitation
</p>
<p>of the 'seventies grew. Also involved were all the complications of
</p>
<p>intrastate and sectional rivalries, with Michigan businessmen and
</p>
<p>eastern capitalists lining up on both sides of the local conflict.
</p>
<p>As a study in railroad and business history, the book also deals
</p>
<p>with the problems of construction and operation in the salad days
</p>
<p>of railroading. It throws light on the career of John W. Brooks, an
</p>
<p>outstanding American railroad builder and enterpreneur who was
</p>
<p>foremost in the making of the Michigan Central Railroad and
</p>
<p>other lines further west.
</p>
<p>Seen thus in proper focus, the great railroad conspiracy emerges
</p>
<p>as more than a ruckus at Michigan Centre in Jackson County,
</p>
<p>Michigan. Its story rises above the level of melodramatic insig-
</p>
<p>nificance and becomes, I believe, an addition to our understanding
</p>
<p>of the American past.
</p>
<p>Specific acknowledgements of help in the preparation of this
</p>
<p>work are listed in the first footnote, which, like all the others, may
</p>
<p>be found at the end of the text.* Here, I wish to take the oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity of thanking Dr. Lewis Beeson, editor of Michigan History,
</p>
<p>for permission to use material which first appeared in that peri-
</p>
<p>odical; and lastly, Amanda, for whom, after all, this book was
</p>
<p>written.

</p>
<p>Th
</p>
<p>.HE STORY of the great railroad conspiraq^ goes back to 1846 when
</p>
<p>the state of Michigan sold its railroads to private chartered cor-
</p>
<p>porations. The state had built and operated two railroads since
</p>
<p>1837 as part of a broad program of internal improvements designed
</p>
<p>at once to build up the interior of Michigan and advance the com-
</p>
<p>mercial interests of its cities, particularly Detroit. By 1845 the rail-
</p>
<p>roads had not reached Lake Michigan from their eastern terminals
</p>
<p>as required by law, and further public construction and operation
</p>
<p>seemed to run into an impasse of financial difficulties and not al-
</p>
<p>together disinterested prejudice. The Central Railroad, which had
</p>
<p>reached Kalamazoo from Detroit, was the farther advanced in con-
</p>
<p>struction and the more profitable of the two roads. It was this road
</p>
<p>that attracted the attention of John W. Brooks, a civil engineer
</p>
<p>who had helped build and operate railroads in New York and New
</p>
<p>England, and James F. Joy, a transplanted Yankee who had won a
</p>
<p>position for himself at the Detroit bar. These two young men, am-
</p>
<p>bitious and shrewd, saw the immense moneymaking possibilities
</p>
<p>in a completed transpeninsular railroad that would tap the ex-
</p>
<p>panding western hinterland and link it with the eastern seaboard.
</p>
<p>Brooks used his eastern connections to interest a group of New
</p>
<p>York and Boston capitalists, and Joy worked on the Michigan leg-
</p>
<p>islature; and in 1846, the Michigan Central Railroad Company
</p>
<p>received a charter and possession of the railroad from Detroit to
</p>
<p>Kalamazoo for the sum of two million dollars. At the same time,
</p>
<p>the other railroad, running through the southern counties from
</p>
<p>Monroe to Hillsdale, ^vas knocked down to the newly chartered
</p>
<p>Michigan Southern Railroad Company.^
</p>
<p>Taking over the Central road in the fall of 1846, Brooks, as su-
</p>
<p>perintendent of the new company, and Joy, as legal counsel, started
</p>
<p>immediately to improve their investment and realize their golden
</p>
<p>vision. Money and men were poured into a concerted drive to reach
</p>
<p>the lake at New Buffalo. Tracks were laid with sixty-pound T-rails

</p>
<p>and the latest model engines and rolling stock put into operation.
</p>
<p>The old line of the road east of Kalamazoo was improved with new
</p>
<p>grades and bridges and the old worn strap rails were replaced with
</p>
<p>the heavier T-rails, By April, 1849, the Michigan Central spanned
</p>
<p>the peninsula, was paying eight and nine percent dividends on
</p>
<p>net earnings of almost $200,000 a year, and the trains were running
</p>
<p>at thirty miles an hour.^
</p>
<p>The drive for efficiency and profits soon brought the company
</p>
<p>into conflict with the farmers along the line of the road. The right
</p>
<p>of way was largely unfenced, and the cattle of the farmers through
</p>
<p>whose land the tracks ran were easy marks for the heavier and
</p>
<p>speedier trains. What incensed the farmers was not only the killing
</p>
<p>of great numbers of cows, sheep, and hogs, but the fact that the
</p>
<p>company refused to pay what they considered fair damages. Much
</p>
<p>livestock had, indeed, been destroyed when the railroad had been
</p>
<p>owned by the state, but the Board of Internal Improvements, the
</p>
<p>state's operating agency, had not dared to antagonize the electors
</p>
<p>by paying less than their claims. One official of the board had com-
</p>
<p>plained in 1845 'h^t the damages paid for cattle maimed and killed
</p>
<p>had reached extravagant proportions and suggested that in cases
</p>
<p>where no negligence on the part of the engineers could be proven,
</p>
<p>the farmers should be made to bear half the loss.^ This impolitic
</p>
<p>suggestion had, of course, never been adopted. Superintendent
</p>
<p>Brooks, however, with no concern for the electorate and respon-
</p>
<p>sible only to the directors and stockholders, was determined to pay
</p>
<p>as little as he could and make the farmers share the risks. He
</p>
<p>claimed that the cattle were trespassers; that the negligence and
</p>
<p>cupidity of the owners were contributory factors; and hinted
</p>
<p>strongly that the farmers were seeking a ready market at each cross-
</p>
<p>ing. Brooks denied any legal liability for damages at all, but of-
</p>
<p>fered, as a measure of expedience, to pay half of the appraised
</p>
<p>value. The aggrieved farmers took this offer as an admission of
</p>
<p>liability and demanded full damages.
</p>
<p>When these were not forthcoming, the issue was fully joined.
</p>
<p>Excitement flared up all along the line of the road from Ann Arbor
</p>
<p>to Niles in the spring of 1849. Near Niles, where the state had

</p>
<p>never operated the railroad and where it was reported that one
</p>
<p>hundred sixty pieces of livestock had been killed in the twelve-mile
</p>
<p>stretch between Niles and Dowagiac, the farmers retaliated for the
</p>
<p>half-pay offer by committing serious depredations, going so far as
</p>
<p>[4]
</p>
<p>to derail an engine by opening a switch. One infuriated citizen
</p>
<p>threatened publicly to tie up traffic entirely. West of Kalamazoo,
</p>
<p>the farmers, under cover of darkness, greased the tracks on the up-
</p>
<p>grades with lard and tallow salvaged by their wives from the car-
</p>
<p>casses, to the great annoyance of the train crews who had to get out
</p>
<p>and sand the tracks before they could proceed. Further east, near
</p>
<p>Ann Arbor, the tracks were actually torn up, presumably by those
</p>
<p>who had had cattle killed.^
</p>
<p>At Marshall, few evening trains passed without being delayed by
</p>
<p>turned switches or shot at. The violent outbursts there were broad-
</p>
<p>cast and justified by one of the village's leading citizens, John D.
</p>
<p>Pierce, in a series of letters to the local Democratic newspaper.
</p>
<p>Pierce, Michigan's first state superintendent of public instruction,
</p>
<p>a member of the legislatures of 1847 ^^^ 1848, and a clergyman by
</p>
<p>training, had recently had some sheep of his own killed on the
</p>
<p>tracks and now took up the cudgels for the farmers in the area. He
</p>
<p>denounced the destruction of livestock and the company's dis-
</p>
<p>claimer of liability and refusal of fair damages. "The road," he de-
</p>
<p>clared in June, 1849, "has been for a long time one gore of blood.
</p>
<p>No heathen altar ever smoked more continually with the blood
</p>
<p>of its victims." And the company dared to charge that the owners
</p>
<p>of cattle were the trespassers. Resort to legal action cost more than
</p>
<p>the cattle were worth. The railroad's "reckless policy" had created
</p>
<p>"an embittered state of feeling along the whole line" and was re-
</p>
<p>sponsible for the fact that the injured persons resorted to violence
</p>
<p>"because they know no other way." Pierce warned the company of
</p>
<p>the consequences of its policy, even though he had "little hope that
</p>
<p>any reason or argument which was not addressed to its cupidity
</p>
<p>would induce a moneyed corporation to change its course." Accord-
</p>
<p>ing to one account, the choleric preacher proved his point. When
</p>
<p>he championed the cause of a poor widow who had a yoke of oxen
</p>
<p>killed, and Superintendent Brooks contemptuously sent word back
</p>
<p>to Marshall to "Tell that parson out there he'd better stick to
</p>
<p>preaching," Pierce replied that if the company did not pay the
</p>
<p>woman, he himself would see to it that every mile of track in Cal-
</p>

</p>
<p>houn County was torn up. The parson's triumph was complete and
</p>
<p>biblical, if momentary, when Brooks paid up in that one case.
</p>
<p>Pierce concluded as follows:
</p>
<p>Something must be done, the honor of the state, its good name . . .
</p>
<p>[5]
</p>
<p>demand it. The road must be fenced in the meantime something near
</p>
<p>the value of the property destroyed must be paid. It is an outrage, and
</p>
<p>evidences utter recklessness of life and limb of both man and beast that
</p>
<p>the company should run trains over an unfenced road, where all cattle
</p>
<p>are by law free commoners, at the rate of thirty miles per hour.
</p>
<p>Neither at Niles nor Marshall nor anywhere else in the state was
</p>
<p>the opposition to the Michigan Central Railroad so intensive and
</p>
<p>so sustained as in the few miles along the line of the road between
</p>
<p>Grass Lake and Michigan Centre in the eastern part of Jackson
</p>
<p>County. It was here that collective protest first brought the offer of
</p>
<p>half pay from Superintendent Brooks, and here that destructive
</p>
<p>reprisals continued for almost two years to disrupt the railroad's
</p>
<p>operations. Precisely why it was so seems difficult to ascertain at
</p>
<p>this distance in time. Perhaps more cattle were killed in Leoni and
</p>
<p>Grass Lake townships than elsewhere, although the evidence is
</p>
<p>not conclusive on this point. Perhaps it was that here the farmers
</p>
<p>found leaders, veritable tribunes of the people, in two men with a
</p>
<p>stubborn determination to see that justice was done, Abel F. Fitch
</p>
<p>of Michigan Centre and Benjamin F. Burnett of Grass Lake. Per-
</p>
<p>haps it was the deliberate choice by Superintendent Brooks of these
</p>
<p>two townships as the arena in which to break the back of the op-
</p>
<p>position to the railroad that brought the most violent reaction in
</p>
<p>the state.^
</p>
<p>The losses between Grass Lake and Michigan Centre, while sub-
</p>
<p>stantial, do not seem to have been unusually heavy. One estimate
</p>
<p>was that forty head of cattle had been killed near the village of
</p>
<p>Leoni. According to a later estimate, damages to the amount of
</p>
<p>|8oo had been inflicted on the farmers of the vicinity.''' The editor
</p>
<p>of a Jackson paper offered the following explanation of the im-
</p>
<p>broglio some fifty years after the events: East of Michigan Centre,
</p>
<p>the railroad track crossed a muskeg or sunken lake, "The Dry
</p>
<p>Marsh" as it was known in the locality, and the cattle in the area,
</p>
<p>which had previously skirted the marsh, began to use the tracks as
</p>
<p>a convenient bridge, with disastrous results to themselves. The rail-
</p>
<p>road, moreover, then brought its own appraisers out from Detroit,

</p>
<p>and the amount of the damages fixed by a company appraiser who
</p>
<p>saw the animals after they had been dead for several days was not
</p>
<p>such as to satisfy the owners.^
</p>
<p>In any case, by the spring of 1 849, the increasing destruction of
</p>
<p>[6]
</p>
<p>livestock and the company's refusal to pay the damages claimed
</p>
<p>aroused the farmers in the vicinity to action. At a number of public
</p>
<p>meetings railroad meetings, they were called they collectively
</p>
<p>requested Superintendent Brooks to modify his policy, to direct the
</p>
<p>engineers to run their trains more carefully, and, until the right
</p>
<p>of way was fenced, to pay full damages. At one of the meetings,
</p>
<p>Abel F. Fitch, Benjamin F. Burnett, and one James Courier were
</p>
<p>chosen as a committee to represent the group's views to the rail-
</p>
<p>road's superintendent in Detroit. The three accordingly wrote
</p>
<p>Brooks a letter informing him of the great excitement among the
</p>
<p>farmers of the region and suggesting the consequences of further
</p>
<p>inflammation of the popular mind by a policy that was not "more
</p>
<p>humane." Brooks, in reply, completely denied the validity of the
</p>
<p>committee's representations. The company, he countered, was not
</p>
<p>legally liable at all for damages to property along the right of way;
</p>
<p>he would, however, pay one half of the appraised value of all cattle
</p>
<p>killed. Meanwhile, he suggested, the company and one of the in-
</p>
<p>jured parties could take a test case to the Supreme Court of the
</p>
<p>state to decide the question of liability, with all costs and fees up
</p>
<p>to $50 to be borne by the company. If the court decided that the
</p>
<p>company were liable, he would thereafter pay in full the damages
</p>
<p>incurred by the farmers. Brooks, at the same time, professed to see
</p>
<p>an implied threat in the committee's letter and went on to add
</p>
<p>that he would hold Fitch, Burnett, and Courier morally if not
</p>
<p>criminally responsible for any injury done the railroad in any at-
</p>
<p>tempts to coerce it.^
</p>
<p>Brooks' proposal, which was published in the Jackson news-
</p>
<p>papers, was never seriously entertained. Abel F. Fitch dismissed it
</p>
<p>on the steps of the American Hotel in Jackson as a "perfect hum-
</p>
<p>bug." The farmers followed his lead and ignored it and then struck
</p>
<p>back in the readiest way at hand by placing obstructions on the
</p>
<p>tracks, stoning the trains, and even shooting at the engines as they
</p>
<p>passed in the night. As Fitch, now become their spokesman, argued,
</p>
<p>the people had had their cattle killed and could not get redress any
</p>
<p>other way. When someone suggested going to court, Fitch denied

</p>
<p>that the people could get their rights that way, and went on to
</p>
<p>attack the whole judicial system in a cynical diatribe of a man who
</p>
<p>knew the political game. He stated bluntly that every man had his
</p>
<p>price and that a judge could be bought as well as any other man;
</p>
<p>[7]
</p>
<p>that he had no more confidence in the judges o the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>than in those of the lower courts they knew enough law but could
</p>
<p>be bought as well as others, though in ordinary cases they were well
</p>
<p>enough; and that he based his opinions on a certain county judge
</p>
<p>whom he named. He denounced the railroad company as an aris-
</p>
<p>tocracy whose influence and money would prevent justice from
</p>
<p>being obtained in any court. When it was argued that endangering
</p>
<p>the lives of innocent passengers was not the way to attain the object
</p>
<p>in view, Fitch heatedly countered that persons who would support
</p>
<p>such a company ought to be injured.
</p>
<p>Fitch's stand was echoed by William Corwin, a teamster at Mich-
</p>
<p>igan Centre, who was a young and irresponsible fellow. One morn-
</p>
<p>ing at the end of May, Corwin was approached by a neighbor,
</p>
<p>Abram Henry, who mentioned that he had heard some shots fired
</p>
<p>as the train passed the night before. He asked Corwin if they were
</p>
<p>firing at the train last night. Corwin casually replied, "Yes, I sup-
</p>
<p>pose so." Henry asked if anyone was killed. Corwin said, "No."
</p>
<p>When Henry then pointed out that by and by they would kill
</p>
<p>somebody, Corwin burst out: "Damn 'em, if they don't want to be
</p>
<p>shot let 'em pay for the cattle they have killed." Henry told him
</p>
<p>that it was a bad idea, for they would kill innocent people who
</p>
<p>paid theit money for riding over the road. Corwin closed the con-
</p>
<p>versation angrily: "Damn 'em, they need not ride over the road
</p>
<p>if they don't want to be killed."
</p>
<p>Not long after, the violent agitation brought the attorney gen-
</p>
<p>eral of Michigan, George V. N. Lothrop, to the scene. He came to
</p>
<p>Jackson from Detroit to investigate the trouble and try to allay the
</p>
<p>unrest. On his arrival, he was met by the committee of three who
</p>
<p>presented the aggrieved farmers' case substantially as they had
</p>
<p>done to Brooks. When Lothrop suggested a remedy at law, they re-
</p>
<p>plied that a poor man would have no chance in a law suit with the
</p>
<p>company. Fitch and Burnett argued with some warmth that the
</p>
<p>railroad was to blame for the excitement and lawlessness; that as
</p>
<p>long as it would not pay fair value for cattle killed, it might expect
</p>
<p>trouble on the road; and that the people were justified in taking

</p>
<p>matters into their own hands, for it was the only means they had
</p>
<p>of bringing the company to terms. Fitch even threatened to send
</p>
<p>handbills to New York, Buffalo, and Chicago, warning the public
</p>
<p>that it was dangerous to pass over the Michigan Central. Lothrop
</p>
<p>[8]
</p>
<p>returned to Detroit and presented the committee's views to Super-
</p>
<p>intendent Brooks. He then wrote the committee that Brooks in-
</p>
<p>sisted that his proposal was a just and hberal one and an earnest
</p>
<p>of the company's solicitude. Brooks gave them every assurance that
</p>
<p>any engineer found wantonly destroying cattle would be dis-
</p>
<p>charged. Furthermore, it had always been the practice of the com-
</p>
<p>pany to pay full value for cattle killed when the owner was too poor
</p>
<p>to bear the loss. For himself, Lothrop condemned the outrages and
</p>
<p>promised that the offenders, who were no better than "pirates and
</p>
<p>wholesale murderers," would be severely punished. Fie then
</p>
<p>warned the three spokesmen that unless they themselves exerted
</p>
<p>an active influence to prevent such conduct, they "must expect to
</p>
<p>be held, in no slight degree, responsible . . ." And like a good poli-
</p>
<p>tician, Lothrop closed on the note of the necessity of compromise.
</p>
<p>Matters remained, however, at an impasse. The verbal exchanges
</p>
<p>proved to be only preludes to a violent and embittered battle. As
</p>
<p>the summer of 1849 advanced and as mutual suspicion and hatred
</p>
<p>mounted, more cattle were killed and further depredations were
</p>
<p>committed against the railroad. When Orlando D. Williams, a
</p>
<p>mason at Leoni, had his cow killed, the company offered him half
</p>
<p>price for it three or four times. He refused the offers and demanded
</p>
<p>$25 or nothing. He told his neighbor it would be a dear cow for
</p>
<p>them. Andrew J. (Jack) Freeland, a successful farmer at Michigan
</p>
<p>Centre, complained he had a number of sheep killed, five or seven,
</p>
<p>and the company offered him half price for them, but if they did
</p>
<p>not pay him full price they would be dear sheep. He slyly said that
</p>
<p>the cars were getting rather skittish about running through Leoni
</p>
<p>Township, and "damn 'em, they'd better pay up for cattle if they
</p>
<p>did not want trouble."
</p>
<p>The railroad did not pay up and it got the trouble. That summer
</p>
<p>and fall passenger and freight trains were frequently stoned, shot
</p>
<p>at, obstructed, and derailed in the ten-mile stretch between Grass
</p>
<p>Lake and Jackson. The assailants would hide in the undergrowth
</p>
<p>along the right of way during the night and throw stones, bricks,
</p>
<p>and bottles and discharge pistols at the passing trains. Sometimes

</p>
<p>they would sally forth to lay rails and logs across the track or throw
</p>
<p>switches. Once the passenger train was stoned a little east of Leoni
</p>
<p>village and the conductor heard a woman scream and went back
</p>
<p>into the cars and a lady handed him a stone which had lodged in
</p>
<p>[9]
</p>
<p>her lap. A man in the next car was badly hurt by a stone which
</p>
<p>hit him in the breast. The conductor went on to find stones in every
</p>
<p>car and many windows broken. One night, an engineer later re-
</p>
<p>called, his passenger train was stoned three times, twice near Fitch's
</p>
<p>house, which stood beside the tracks at Michigan Centre, and once
</p>
<p>west of Leoni. On investigation, he found the mark of a brick five
</p>
<p>inches long on the tank and a big dent on his boiler. Another night
</p>
<p>that summer, the same engineer was shot at as he approached Mich-
</p>
<p>igan Centre. He saw a flash of guns, some four or five of them, from
</p>
<p>about thirty or forty feet from the tracks and later found the marks
</p>
<p>of a ball on one of the engine's feed pipes. This engineer had no
</p>
<p>taste for these extra hazards of railroading and soon left his job
</p>
<p>with the Michigan Central for one in another state. Another engi-
</p>
<p>neer later admitted that he sometimes cowered behind the driving
</p>
<p>wheel guards as he rode through the badlands at Michigan
</p>
<p>Centre.io
</p>
<p>The attacks were varied by placing rails, old ties, and the dis-
</p>
<p>carded strap iron rails across the tracks or jamming them in be-
</p>
<p>tween the joints of the rails and in the switches. The company
</p>
<p>had to run a hand car ahead of the trains between Grass Lake and
</p>
<p>Jackson, but the determined assailants would simply hide along-
</p>
<p>side the track and then, after the hand car had passed, run out and
</p>
<p>do their mischief. Traffic was greatly slowed up and the train
</p>
<p>schedules were knocked awry, for each obstruction meant stopping
</p>
<p>the train and getting out and clearing the tracks. The run from
</p>
<p>Grass Lake to Jackson, which normally took forty-five minutes,
</p>
<p>sometimes took as long as an hour and twenty-five minutes. The
</p>
<p>crawling pace through the disaffected areas was indeed a necessity
</p>
<p>if the trains were not to be run off with great loss of life and
</p>
<p>property.
</p>
<p>Once that summer, the locomotive Dexter was drawing a rack
</p>
<p>train loaded with timber going west in the late afternoon. The con-
</p>
<p>ductor, Harmon Spaulding, was in the cab with the engineer and
</p>
<p>the fireman. The train slowed down after reaching Leoni but then
</p>
<p>speeded up in order to make way for the eastbound passenger train

</p>
<p>expected at that time. About a half mile east of Michigan Centre,
</p>
<p>as the engine rounded a curve running along the Dry Marsh,
</p>
<p>Spaulding sighted a stick of timber lying across the track. The
</p>
<p>engineer reversed the engine and then both he and the fireman
</p>
<p>[ lO]
</p>
<p>jumped for their lives. Spaulding stayed on as the wheels hit the
</p>
<p>log, cut it in two, and ground to a stop near the crossing at Mich-
</p>
<p>igan Centre. A group of men came up to the stalled engine, among
</p>
<p>whom Spaulding recognized Abel Fitch and Ammi Filley, pro-
</p>
<p>prietor of the tavern at the Centre. Fitch asked, "Spaulding, what's
</p>
<p>the trouble?" Spaulding pointedly told him that "some damned
</p>
<p>hyenas" had put a timber on the track and tried to run the train
</p>
<p>off. Someone in the crowd shouted they wished they had run it
</p>
<p>off. To this, Spaulding replied, "I don't see what you have against
</p>
<p>me, as I have not been running on the road for some time." Filley
</p>
<p>here chimed in with the remark that they did not care who they
</p>
<p>killed and would as lief kill him as any one else. Spaulding then
</p>
<p>asked Fitch what their object was and the latter replied that there
</p>
<p>had been cattle killed that had not been paid for. Fitch continued,
</p>
<p>shouting, "Spaulding, by God, the company can never run this
</p>
<p>road in safety until they come out and pay us our price for killing
</p>
<p>cattle and damages done to other property." Spaulding then
</p>
<p>argued that he couldn't see why the obstruction was put on at
</p>
<p>that time, unless it was intended to catch the passenger train, as
</p>
<p>they did not know this timber train was coming along. Somebody
</p>
<p>ans^vered to the effect that the men who put it there knew their
</p>
<p>business. Spaulding, his temper rising, warned the men that if it
</p>
<p>had got to that pass that the company could not do business on
</p>
<p>the road, he for one Avas ready to come out and defend the road
</p>
<p>with arms if necessary. Fitch threw the threat right back and said
</p>
<p>they might come on if that was the game he had two double-
</p>
<p>barreled guns and some loaded pistols ready for business and men
</p>
<p>enough to use them. At this point, Spaulding judiciously decided
</p>
<p>that matters had gone far enough for the moment; the temper of the
</p>
<p>crowd seemed to be ugly and a strategic withdrawal was in order.
</p>
<p>The train moved on only to find more obstructions ahead, several
</p>
<p>bars of strap rail and the skin of a dead cow, and it was Spaulding
</p>
<p>who went ahead on foot to remove them.
</p>
<p>Yet another form of vicious bedevilment was to set fire to the
</p>
<p>piles of company lumber stacked along the right of way for the use

<p>of the locomotives. Late one night in the fall of 1849, three of the
</p>
<p>more law-abiding citizens of Leoni were returning from Jackson on
</p>
<p>foot along the tracks. They came upon two woodpiles burning
</p>
<p>about a mile west of Michigan Centre, and went to work to put
</p>
<p>[ 11 ]
</p>
<p>the fires out. As the train passed, they stopped it and asked for help,
</p>
<p>but got only an unceremonious damning from the jittery, distrust-
</p>
<p>ful train crew. As day broke, the little group, still hard at work
</p>
<p>putting out the fires, was accosted by three friends somewhat less
</p>
<p>concerned with the preservation of the property of the railroad.
</p>
<p>They were Fitch, Filley, and Erastus Champlin, a farmer at the
</p>
<p>Centre, who explained that they had been hailed by the train crew
</p>
<p>back at the Centre and told that the woodpiles were on fire. The
</p>
<p>newcomers were content to stand there, taunting and reviling the
</p>
<p>fire fighters. Champlin sneered that the train crew was perfectly
</p>
<p>right in damning them, they ought to be damned, and damn those
</p>
<p>who didn't damn them. Fitch, with wry humor, told them that they
</p>
<p>ought to be burnt up with the wood, then the company would pay
</p>
<p>their wives half price for the ashes. When one of the conscientious
</p>
<p>ones remonstrated that he thought it was his duty to try and save
</p>
<p>property when it was being destroyed. Fitch answered that he had
</p>
<p>never put anything on the track and would not take anything off
</p>
<p>if he saw the cars coming with Brooks and the whole company in
</p>
<p>them and "it knocked them all to hell." The fires presumably were
</p>
<p>put out, but certainly without the help of the vindictive Michigan
</p>
<p>Centreites. At another time. Fitch refused a request for help in
</p>
<p>putting out a blazing culvert, saying, "You will have to go out of
</p>
<p>this town to get help to put it out."
</p>
<p>Not all the mishaps that afflicted the railroad in the summer and
</p>
<p>fall of 1849 could be attributed, directly or circumstantially, to the
</p>
<p>lawless citizens of Michigan Centre, Leoni, and Grass Lake. Some
</p>
<p>were simply accidents due to the rather primitive railroading oper-
</p>
<p>ations. Several engines and trains were derailed after running into
</p>
<p>cattle grazing on the track, which must have seemed like divine
</p>
<p>retribution to Fitch and his friends. The negligence of track crews
</p>
<p>doubtless accounted for a number of accidents. Nor had attacks on
</p>
<p>the trains disappeared elsewhere along the line of the road. East
</p>
<p>and west of Niles and between Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor, occasional
</p>
<p>depredations continued to make travel on the Michigan Central a
</p>
<p>hazardous venture.^^

</p>
<p>Superintendent Brooks was soon convinced of the need for
</p>
<p>strong measures to eliminate the threat to the road's operations.
</p>
<p>Business during 1849 was none too good in any case, what with the
</p>
<p>poor crop, an outbreak of cholera in the state, and the continued
</p>
<p>[ 12]
</p>
<p>strong competition of the lake boats that took passengers to Chi-
</p>
<p>cago around Michigan via the lakes. The attacks by those whom
</p>
<p>Brooks could only recognize as marauding felons were driving
</p>
<p>passengers to travel around the lakes rather than risk life and limb
</p>
<p>on the Michigan Central. ^^
</p>
<p>Brooks' first step was to station company police or watchmen
</p>
<p>along the track in the troubled area. He then offered a reward of
</p>
<p>$500 for the detection and conviction of the criminals who had ob-
</p>
<p>structed or would obstruct the railroad, and circulated printed
</p>
<p>handbills to that effect along the line. The reward circulars singled
</p>
<p>out for special consideration those "sundry evil minded persons,
</p>
<p>in and about the village of Leoni," but also extended its terms to
</p>
<p>"similar offenders on any part of the road."
</p>
<p>These measvires did not prove effective. Not a single offender
</p>
<p>was caught nor a single attack discovered in time. If anything, the
</p>
<p>presence of the police only put the "sundry evil minded persons"
</p>
<p>on their guard and led them to resort to devious maneuver; they
</p>
<p>were easily able to spot and outwit the special watch. Once in
</p>
<p>August, Brooks and Joy, who directed the legal action, thought
</p>
<p>they had cornered their game and were ready to make an example
</p>
<p>that would forestall further attacks, but found they had only
</p>
<p>caught a tartar. One of the special police, Elwood Cook, went to
</p>
<p>the grand jury of Jackson County and made out an information
</p>
<p>against one James A. Lester, charging him with obstructing the
</p>
<p>railroad. Attorney General Lothrop came out to Jackson from De-
</p>
<p>troit and prodded the grand jury into issuing an indictment
</p>
<p>against Lester.i^ It seemed as though the law were at last ready to
</p>
<p>step in and strike down the enemies of the railroad.
</p>
<p>The law, however, reckoned without the determination of Fitch
</p>
<p>and Burnett. As soon as Lester was arrested, these two came to his
</p>
<p>defense. They unearthed evidence and brought witnesses to show
</p>
<p>that it was Cook who had obstructed the railroad and then laid the
</p>
<p>crime to Lester in the hope of gaining the $500 reward. Fitch and
</p>
<p>Burnett presented these findings to the not wholly unsympathetic
</p>
<p>citizens of the Jackson County Grand Jury, which then found a

</p>
<p>true bill against Cook for perjury four days after it had indicted
</p>
<p>Lester. With the tables thus turned, Joy had to come to Cook's
</p>
<p>defense. Neither case, however, came to trial; both were eventually
</p>
<p>nolle prossed.i^
</p>
<p>[ 13]
</p>
<p>This legal defeat convinced Brooks and Joy that they were using
</p>
<p>the wrong tactics. They realized that they were not facing a num-
</p>
<p>ber of lawless individuals but a body of citizens united in hatred of
</p>
<p>the railroad and belief in the justice of their cause. Public senti-
</p>
<p>ment in Jackson County was largely ranged against the Michigan
</p>
<p>Central and convictions by local juries would be difficult if not
</p>
<p>impossible to obtain. Detection of the guilty by ordinary police
</p>
<p>methods had proven ineffective. Action against relatively unim-
</p>
<p>portant individuals, moreover, would not halt the attacks. The
</p>
<p>company faced the necessity of resorting to extraordinary methods
</p>
<p>to gain evidence against its enemies and then, of striking at the
</p>
<p>head and heart of the opposition, at its leaders, at Fitch, Burnett,
</p>
<p>and the more active of their followers. Brooks and Joy set their
</p>
<p>sights accordingly.
</p>
<p>Fitch had without doubt emerged as the leader of the road's op-
</p>
<p>ponents. His position in the community and his opinions had led to
</p>
<p>his choice on the committee of three that acted for the citizens as-
</p>
<p>sembled in public protest; he had probably been active in organiz-
</p>
<p>ing the meetings in the first place. Subsequently, his leadership
</p>
<p>was reinforced by the promptings of his conscience, by a self-
</p>
<p>imposed trust as advocate of the cause of his friends and neighbors.
</p>
<p>It was expressed in his activities on behalf of Lester and his public
</p>
<p>defense of the attacks on the railroad and denunciation of the com-
</p>
<p>pany's policies. And Superintendent Brooks could only have con-
</p>
<p>cluded that Fitch was his nemesis, the gadfly of the opposition,
</p>
<p>when in the fall of 1849 he received a letter from him complaining
</p>
<p>of the fact that the trains were not stopping at Michigan Centre
</p>
<p>to pick up passengers who were giving the usual signal. "Now if
</p>
<p>this policy," Fitch warned in closing, "comes from you or your
</p>
<p>legal advisers, as did the insulting half pay proposition for killing
</p>
<p>cattle, if serious accidents do occur on the road, on your head, and
</p>
<p>yours alone, must rest the responsibility." Brooks promptly an-
</p>
<p>swered the letter with maddening politeness, if none too helpfully,
</p>
<p>by enclosing a handbill with a schedule of train stops. "If any
</p>
<p>train has passed your station, which according to it, should stop

</p>
<p>there," he explained, "I would be quite obliged for any informa-
</p>
<p>tion that will point to a specific train, when I can correct it." With
</p>
<p>that reply, the incident was closed; it was in itself not of great
</p>
<p>moment, but served to aggravate ill feeling and convince Brooks
</p>
<p>[ H]
</p>
<p>that Fitch was the instigator of all the company's many troubles.
</p>
<p>Abel F. Fitch was an amalgam of shrewdness and idealism that
</p>
<p>in most other men happily serves or is made to serve their own ag-
</p>
<p>grandizement. In his case, the two ingredients clashed and eventu-
</p>
<p>ally led to his downfall. He had come to Michigan with his wife
</p>
<p>from his native Connecticut in 1832 and located on the Clinton
</p>
<p>Road near Jackson where he opened a tavern which was soon
</p>
<p>widely known as the old "Fitch stand." Turning from whiskey to
</p>
<p>real estate, he took a profitable part in the speculative orgy of the
</p>
<p>middle 1830's. He invested some of his gains in the stock of the
</p>
<p>Jackson County Bank and was implicated in the collapse of that
</p>
<p>wildcat institution and made the target of several indictments for
</p>
<p>conspiracy in 1838. Like most of the businessmen in that frontier
</p>
<p>community, he emerged unscathed and unmoved and went on to
</p>
<p>become a leading public figure. When Michigan was admitted as a
</p>
<p>state in 1837, Fitch, now living in Michigan Centre, a community
</p>
<p>he had helped develop to his own profit, was a delegate to the
</p>
<p>convention which met to organize the Democratic Party in Jackson
</p>
<p>County. He enlarged his public services by organizing a squadron
</p>
<p>of cavalry, the Barry Horse Guards, in the state militia in 1843 and
</p>
<p>was commissioned its captain. Tenders of political trust by his
</p>
<p>neighbors made him Inspector of Elections in Leoni Township and
</p>
<p>local representative on the Board of County Canvassers in 1850
</p>
<p>and 1851. On April 7, 1851, he was elected Supervisor of Leoni
</p>
<p>Township on the Democratic ticket. He lived in style at Michigan
</p>
<p>Centre, in a spacious home complete with verandahs and shade
</p>
<p>trees, on an estate valued at $8,000 with more than five hundred
</p>
<p>acres of orchards, pastures, gardens, a lake, and a deer park, as well
</p>
<p>as productive fields. Gifted with a happy family of wife and two
</p>
<p>adopted children, numerous friends, and a sense of humor, enjoy-
</p>
<p>ing his books, pictures and music he played the clarionet this
</p>
<p>prosperous country squire, the richest man in the township, could
</p>
<p>have proudly and thankfully rested on his laurels as he looked
</p>
<p>back at his full forty-three years. ^^

<p>law-abiding citizens, members of respectable churches, and vocal
</p>
<p>but realistic exponents of the ideals of justice and right. But Fitch
</p>
<p>possessed something of the Yankee conscience that held him to
</p>
<p>strict account and would take no tittle of compromise, that made
</p>
<p>[ 15]
</p>
<p>him a come-outer when silence would have been safer and deeds
</p>
<p>could have been dismissed as unnecessary and ineffective. In re-
</p>
<p>ligion, he was, according to Burnett who knew him well, a Uni-
</p>
<p>versalist, that rather broad humane American sect that was out-
</p>
<p>side the pale of organized churchdom and orthodox doctrine. His
</p>
<p>belief in God was strong and real as was his faith in His goodness,
</p>
<p>though he spoke lightly of His conventional representatives on
</p>
<p>earth. Once, defending the men of Leoni, Fitch jokingly laid the
</p>
<p>shootings to a local Baptist clergyman, and to a Congregational di-
</p>
<p>vine in Jackson whom he called "Priest" Foster, and told how he
</p>
<p>had remonstrated with them to no avail, such hardened evil-doers
</p>
<p>were they. On the greatest moral question of the day, slavery. Fitch
</p>
<p>was on the side of freedom. According to one promoter of the Un-
</p>
<p>derground Railroad in Michigan, Fitch was its agent in Michigan
</p>
<p>Centre. When he was elected county supervisor, he was sneeringly
</p>
<p>classified as a free soil loco by the opposition Whig sheet. And
</p>
<p>when "Priest" Foster, the Reverend Gustavus L. Foster of the Con-
</p>
<p>gregational Church in Jackson, delivered a sermon denouncing
</p>
<p>the Fugitive Slave Law and counselling disobedience, he must have
</p>
<p>risen greatly in Fitch's esteem. For when Fitch was arrested and his
</p>
<p>person was searched, the only incriminating evidence found on
</p>
<p>him was a reprint of the Reverend Foster's "higher law" sermon.
</p>
<p>And his subsequent notoriety brought him the dubious acclaim of
</p>
<p>eastern newspapers as one of Michigan's most prominent aboli-
</p>
<p>tionists.i^
</p>
<p>Such was the man who had come forward as the advocate of the
</p>
<p>people's rights in the eastern part of Jackson County a pillar of
</p>
<p>society, a shrewd but amiable country squire, and withal, a man of
</p>
<p>unorthodox bent, with principles, who did not fear to express and
</p>
<p>act on them. And when he spoke out against Brooks' policies, he
</p>
<p>was also moved by disinterested principle. "They done wrong," he
</p>
<p>later explained, "when they took the poor man's last cow without
</p>
<p>remuneration." His only crime was that he had the "indipendance
</p>
<p>to tell them [that] to their faces." There is no evidence that Fitch's
</p>
<p>own interests were at stake or in any way affected or that he stood

</p>
<p>to gain anything personally by his actions. "If money making was
</p>
<p>my object," (and Fitch knew well how to achieve that mercenary
</p>
<p>end), he wrote his wife, "I could sell myself to them for a great
</p>
<p>price, they have already made advances, but they have waked up
</p>
<p>[16]
</p>
<p>the wrong passenger." Nor is there any evidence, as was later al-
</p>
<p>leged by the press, that Fitch was satisfying an old grudge against
</p>
<p>the railroad arising from a dispute over payment for a parcel of
</p>
<p>his land.^'^
</p>
<p>Fitch did not, however, abandon all caution. Defending and
</p>
<p>abetting his followers, he never himself took part in any of the at-
</p>
<p>tacks. Publicly and before outsiders, he did not even approve,
</p>
<p>though he might extenuate the acts of violence that endangered
</p>
<p>the lives of innocent people. He preferred himself to fight the
</p>
<p>railroad where his influence could be most effective: in the courts,
</p>
<p>in the legislature, among his friends in the East whom he asked
</p>
<p>to discourage travel on the Michigan Central. And when Lothrop,
</p>
<p>now in the service of the railroad, saw Fitch helping in the legisla-
</p>
<p>tive fight against the road in Lansing in 1851, the latter was sure
</p>
<p>that the former attorney general "had rather see the evel (sic) one
</p>
<p>than to have seen me . . . here." ^^
</p>
<p>Fitch's adjutant in the campaign against the Michigan Central
</p>
<p>was Benjamin F. Burnett, the vocal lawyer from Grass Lake, hon-
</p>
<p>orifically known as Judge Burnett. The "Judge" was no more than
</p>
<p>a village lawyer, probably self-trained, a litigant as often as he was
</p>
<p>counsel, who had garnered neither laurels nor lucre in his profes-
</p>
<p>sion. A man of some education and ability, he had also tried his
</p>
<p>hand at surveying, but by 1850, his total assets did not exceed
</p>
<p>|8oo. His motives in working and clamoring for those who came to
</p>
<p>be known as the "railroad conspirators" are not clear. He may
</p>
<p>have been something of a maverick, having unsuccessfully run for
</p>
<p>county surveyor in 1848 as a Free Soiler. Ambitious, contentious,
</p>
<p>and not always scrupulous of legal and conventional niceties, he
</p>
<p>may have been fishing in troubled waters when he adopted the
</p>
<p>cause of the people. Once having made his choice, however, he
</p>
<p>stuck to it through abuse and imprisonment. His later journalistic
</p>
<p>crusade on behalf of the "conspirators," in and out of jail, helped
</p>
<p>keep the issue "before the people" until a measure of justice was
</p>
<p>realized.i^

<p>in-law of Fitch and owner of the tavern at Michigan Centre, next
</p>
<p>to the tracks, across the road from Fitch's house. His relation to
</p>
<p>Fitch, his comparative wealth, and above all, his control of seem-
</p>
<p>ingly unlimited supplies of whiskey gave him some standing among
</p>
<p>[ 17 ]
</p>
<p>the farmers of the locality, if it tarnished his name in the county at
</p>
<p>large. He had come to Michigan from Connecticut in 1833, and
</p>
<p>after unsuccessful business ventures in and around Jackson and
</p>
<p>some notoriety as the father of "The Lost Boy," William Filley,
</p>
<p>who disappeared among the Indians, had established himself as
</p>
<p>the tavern keeper of Michigan Centre. He was not poor: his prop-
</p>
<p>erty was valued at $4,200 and he employed as many as twelve men
</p>
<p>on his lands, from which he sent fish and game to the Detroit
</p>
<p>market. Angered by the railroad's policy in some altercation over
</p>
<p>the building of fences, he nursed his hurt into vindictiveness and
</p>
<p>unrestrainedly denounced the road, prodded his friends and em-
</p>
<p>ployees to violent attacks, and even personally put his hand to
</p>
<p>stoning the trains and obstructing the tracks.^o
</p>
<p>It was Filley's tavern that served as the natural headquarters
</p>
<p>where discontent was expressed, allayed, and fortified over the bar
</p>
<p>or at the card table or the nine-pin alley outside. Here grievances
</p>
<p>were loudly aired and anger fanned and the escapades hatched,
</p>
<p>more often than not under the influence of the liquor which Filley
</p>
<p>had ordered his bartenders to dispense so freely. "They generally
</p>
<p>drank by platoons," one observer reported of the almost nightly
</p>
<p>gatherings at Filley's. And if this popular rendezvous by the tracks
</p>
<p>was later denominated a "low country tavern," it certainly was the
</p>
<p>poor man's club in Leoni Township.21
</p>
<p>Here Orlando Williams, the stone mason, bibulously boasted of
</p>
<p>his feats, imaginary and real, in getting back at the railroad. Here
</p>
<p>Bill Corwin, the shiftless teamster and occasional barkeep, who
</p>
<p>took his pay in liquid kind, got up his bravado for destructive
</p>
<p>sorties. Here the Price boys, Eben and Richard, blacksmiths by
</p>
<p>trade, joined in the roistering that sometimes led to drunken
</p>
<p>brawls and sometimes to alcoholic feats of derring-do. Here Eras-
</p>
<p>tus Champlin, farmer, and his two sons, Lyman and Willard,
</p>
<p>damned the railroad and swore vengeance. And here, too, came
</p>
<p>the railroad agents to gather their evidence of crimes committed
</p>
<p>and planned. Sometimes, too, the boys would journey to the tavern
</p>
<p>at Leoni village for a "ball" or to some "grocery" or hotel at Jack-

<p>son where the usual round of quaffing, boasts, threats, and forays
</p>
<p>would be repeated.
</p>
<p>During the long winter of 1849-1850 or, in railroad parlance,
</p>
<p>after the close of the season, activity and talk abated with the cold
</p>
<p>[ 18]
</p>
<p>weather. Once the lakes were frozen, through traffic fell off greatly
</p>
<p>if not completely, and the occasions and targets for depredations
</p>
<p>did not present themselves. But once the thaws came and the trains
</p>
<p>began to run again, the battle was renewed by both sides with in-
</p>
<p>creased vigor.22
</p>
<p>During the spring, summer, and fall of 1850, resentment over
</p>
<p>more cattle killed and Superintendent Brooks' half-pay policy
</p>
<p>seemed to grow and intensify. Resentment was soon translated into
</p>
<p>threats and threats into violence. The burden of complaint was
</p>
<p>the old one: the company would never run over the road in safety
</p>
<p>until it paid up for property destroyed; if they could not get their
</p>
<p>revenge in one way, they would get it in another; they would let
</p>
<p>the company know there was "a. God in Israel; the company would
</p>
<p>be glad bye and bye to pay up for cattle or if they did not they
</p>
<p>would catch hell." Lyman Champlin angrily threatened that if
</p>
<p>they did not pay for the old gray mare they killed, he would keep
</p>
<p>the railroad wood and fences on fire. In June, Burnett had a cow
</p>
<p>killed at Grass Lake and when a neighbor joked him for not com-
</p>
<p>mencing suit and getting pay for it, he declared he would have
</p>
<p>full pay or full satisfaction before he receipted for the critter. Bill
</p>
<p>Corwin, in the course of a conversation with a neighbor, pulled out
</p>
<p>of his pocket a printed pamphlet called "The Railroad Dream"
</p>
<p>and read aloud of a poor man's cow being killed and how he had
</p>
<p>sued the company and got nothing. "By Jesus," Corwin exclaimed,
</p>
<p>"is the people going to stand this? No, by Jesus, they'll catch it
</p>
<p>before long."
</p>
<p>Sometimes, tongues loosened by alcohol talked in a kind of des-
</p>
<p>perate confidence of a great coup or some ingenious plan to destroy
</p>
<p>the road at one blow. Jack Freeland once freely and openly de-
</p>
<p>scribed a plan for placing powder on the rails with a fuse running
</p>
<p>from it, so timed as to explode when the trains passed. Another
</p>
<p>time, Ebenezer Farnham, a dentist in Jackson who was as much
</p>
<p>given to drink as to the practice of his profession and who sympa-
</p>
<p>thized with the plight of the Leonians, emerged from a "grocery"
</p>
<p>in that town, collared a passing friend, pulled him into an alley,

</p>
<p>and said, "I want to tell you something for I believe you to be a
</p>
<p>pretty damned good fellow." The friend thought the doctor was
</p>
<p>pretty well corned as he went on: "The railroad hell and damna-
</p>
<p>tion, the railroad will all be blown up in less than a month. . ."
</p>
<p>[ 19]
</p>
<p>The happy dentist gloated in drunken glee, "5 10,000 all gone to
</p>
<p>hell in one minute and I've got the tools to do it," and hung on to
</p>
<p>his listener for dear life. Orlando Williams promised the assem-
</p>
<p>bled company at Morrison's grocery in Jackson that he would tear
</p>
<p>up the track from Michigan Centre to Leoni to make the com-
</p>
<p>pany pay for cattle killed. At Hadden's grocery in Jackson, ^Vil-
</p>
<p>liams confidentially offered a fellow barfly a chance to make $500
</p>
<p>by burning the railroad company's steamers, the Mayflower and
</p>
<p>the Atlantic, and bringing them to the water's edge. At Filley's
</p>
<p>one day, between drinks, Williams boasted that the company
</p>
<p>would be glad to eat salt out of their hands in a few days and that
</p>
<p>it should be made to pay double value for cattle killed. Bill Cor-
</p>
<p>win almost matched Williams' big talk about what he was going
</p>
<p>to do to the company. Once in Jackson, he had swapped horses
</p>
<p>with Caleb Loud, dealer in "Loud's Celebrated Ointment" for
</p>
<p>horses, and the two were riding around the sheds by the railroad
</p>
<p>depot. Loud remarked that a fire there would sweep the whole
</p>
<p>lower town. Corwin put his hand on Loud's arm and said, "Just
</p>
<p>remember my word, there will be one here before long." Corwin
</p>
<p>also felt impelled to seek new recruits in back of Morrison's gro-
</p>
<p>cery to tear up the track and burn the depot at Jackson, promising
</p>
<p>large sums of money.
</p>
<p>None of these grandiose plans for destroying the railroad ever
</p>
<p>materialized. But attacks similar to those of the season of 1849 con-
</p>
<p>tinued to harass the operation of trains between Grass Lake and
</p>
<p>Jackson. The summer and fall of 1850 were punctuated with the
</p>
<p>familiar shootings, stonings, obstructions, and burnings.
</p>
<p>More than one evening, as a bunch of the boys were gathered at
</p>
<p>Filley's, someone would suggest that they go and give them a few
</p>
<p>stones or "give them hell again tonight," and a group would sally
</p>
<p>out to stone the trains amidst the startled cries of the passengers.
</p>
<p>One dark night in August, Filley, Jacob Wolliver, his devil or
</p>
<p>handyman, and the two Price boys got an ax and went out to
</p>
<p>throw the cars off. About three-quarters of a mile west of Leoni,
</p>
<p>where the tracks crossed a culvert over a six-foot bank, they broke

</p>
<p>the chairs that held the rails in place and moved them to one side.
</p>
<p>They then went off forty or sixty rods and lay down and waited.
</p>
<p>An eastbound train, pulled by the locomotive Gazelle came along
</p>
<p>and ran into the open track. The Gazelle ran off and capsized and
</p>
<p>[20]
</p>
<p>the train crews worked many hours getting her back on. Filley later
</p>
<p>described the incident as good clean sport: how when they went
</p>
<p>out cooning, the road was the best ground to go on; the Gazelle
</p>
<p>was a big coon they caught the other night but they had lost its
</p>
<p>tail, "but damn 'em," they will have that soon; it had taken a good
</p>
<p>many men to get the coon on the track again, and he did not want
</p>
<p>anything better than an ax and a crow bar to shoot a coon with.
</p>
<p>Fitch, too, indulged in his characteristic humor when he told how
</p>
<p>the Gazelle had got dry and, having no pump aboard, was forced
</p>
<p>to go down into the marsh for water.
</p>
<p>During the state fair at Ann Arbor in September, 1850, a conduc-
</p>
<p>tor later recalled, it seemed almost impossible to get through Leoni
</p>
<p>and Michigan Centre at night without some trouble. This was de-
</p>
<p>spite the fact that all train crews had been warned to proceed
</p>
<p>slowly and with great caution through these places. One night dur-
</p>
<p>ing the fair, this conductor was running a train west and at Grass
</p>
<p>Lake told the engineer he could run to Michigan Centre at normal
</p>
<p>speed. Soon a passenger asked him why they were running faster
</p>
<p>than usual and the conductor explained: "There is no danger; we
</p>
<p>have the head devils on board, and the gang will not hurt them."
</p>
<p>And he pointed down the car to where Fitch and Filley were
</p>
<p>sitting, on their way back from a visit to the fair. 23
</p>
<p>That same month, a group from the Centre had gone to Leoni
</p>
<p>village to help Ephraim Barrett in his law suit against the railroad
</p>
<p>company for damages for a cow that had been killed. Barrett had
</p>
<p>been offered $15 and would have liked to accept that sum, but his
</p>
<p>neighbors urged him not to. The suit at Leoni was fruitless, and
</p>
<p>the men returned to Michigan Centre embittered. After their re-
</p>
<p>turn, Filley and Wolliver went out and stuck a tie into the culvert
</p>
<p>west of Fitch's house so that it would strike the lamp on the next
</p>
<p>engine that came along. They also put a mudsill across the track
</p>
<p>nearby, and then retired from the scene. The freight train was duly
</p>
<p>halted and Fitch and Filley came up and innocently inquired what
</p>
<p>the matter was. Receiving no enlightenment from one member of
</p>
<p>the train crew, which was busy removing the obstructions, they re-

</p>
<p>peated their question to another, and got only abuse in reply. "You
</p>
<p>damned hounds," the train hand cursed, "every one of you should
</p>
<p>be hung up." Now riled. Fitch and Filley went around to the rear
</p>
<p>of the train and put on the brakes. The two then went up the track
</p>
<p>[21 ]
</p>
<p>a way and hugely enjoyed watching the sparks fly from the wheels
</p>
<p>as the train struggled up a grade.
</p>
<p>In October, the engine Rocket ran off at Michigan Centre after
</p>
<p>it had hit an open switch. Although the engine tore up the side
</p>
<p>track it was not upset, but it took about seven hours to get it back
</p>
<p>on the tracks. With each successful attack on the road, Filley took
</p>
<p>great delight in giving the company credit in some imaginary
</p>
<p>ledger against the unpaid balance for cattle killed $i for each
</p>
<p>stoning and proportionately greater amounts for more substantial
</p>
<p>losses. Fitch, too, made estimates of losses the company had suffered
</p>
<p>and reckoned that the cattle killed between Grass Lake and Jack-
</p>
<p>son had already cost the company about I400 per head. These
</p>
<p>vengeful calculations also included mishaps on the Michigan Cen-
</p>
<p>tral with which the boys from the Centre had nothing to do, al-
</p>
<p>though they were later charged with them. Two such accidents
</p>
<p>must be laid entirely to chance or negligence. In June, 1850, a bag-
</p>
<p>gage car carrying United States mail took fire and was destroyed a
</p>
<p>little east of Jackson. Again, a train was thrown off the track at
</p>
<p>Leoni because a track crew had removed some of the rail at that
</p>
<p>point and the engineer had not seen their signal in time to stop.^^
</p>
<p>Fitch, except for the time when he had reversed the brakes on
</p>
<p>the stalled train, continued to confine his activities to those of
</p>
<p>public advocate. In Michigan Centre and in Jackson, he made no
</p>
<p>secret of his unyielding opposition to the railroad's policy and of
</p>
<p>his opinion that the trouble the road was having was fully de-
</p>
<p>served; that it was the only means of bringing the company to
</p>
<p>terms; that the depredations would divert travel from the road and
</p>
<p>"bring them to their milk." He justified the actions of his friends
</p>
<p>with an illustration: suppose a man owned a large tract of land
</p>
<p>near the town and the village cattle troubled him, he could dig
</p>
<p>pits and get the cattle into them the land being his own, they
</p>
<p>could not help themselves the owners of the cattle, however, had
</p>
<p>a right to take the law into their own hands and that would be
</p>
<p>their only remedy. Fitch's analogy is pertinent only if one remem-
</p>
<p>bers that cattle in that sparsely settled and unfenced country were

</p>
<p>regarded at law as free commoners and allowed to run at large.^s
</p>
<p>At times. Fitch not altogether jokingly laid the violence to the
</p>
<p>railroad police, adding that he would like to catch the spies on his
</p>
<p>land and "fix 'em out." In the same breath, he admitted that ston-
</p>
<p>[22]
</p>
<p>ing was "mild means" his friends were using and boasted that "the
</p>
<p>company was nearly used up now and had gone down with only
</p>
<p>fifteen passengers on one train." When someone accused Fitch him-
</p>
<p>self of stoning the cars as they passed his house, he replied with
</p>
<p>brazen humor that it was "a damned lie" as he was upstairs looking
</p>
<p>out of the window at the attack.
</p>
<p>To his respectable friends. Fitch talked with more caution and
</p>
<p>some hypocrisy. That fall, Alonzo Bennett, a merchant of Jackson,
</p>
<p>warned Fitch that the boys had already gone far enough and that
</p>
<p>a few words from him or a little labor would stop the depredations.
</p>
<p>Fitch replied that he knew that what the boys w^ere doing was
</p>
<p>wrong and that they must look out. But, he went on, he had also
</p>
<p>told them to get pay for their cattle if they could, and if they could
</p>
<p>not, they must lay their plans so as not to get caught at it. He con-
</p>
<p>cluded piously that if the company would only pay full value,
</p>
<p>"they would have God almighty on their side and be prosperous."
</p>
<p>About the same time, when the Jackson American Citizen edi-
</p>
<p>torially condemned both the company for not paying full value
</p>
<p>and the residents of Leoni for taking the law into their own hands,
</p>
<p>Fitch personally assured the editor, Charles V. De Land, of his
</p>
<p>"perfect sympathy" with those sentiments.-^
</p>
<p>Fitch's advocacy of their cause and the failure of the company
</p>
<p>to catch any of the offenders gave the Leonians a feeling of con-
</p>
<p>fidence. Bound together by their grievances and sense of wrong,
</p>
<p>they were further united in a community of interest by the un-
</p>
<p>hampered successes of their campaign of retaliation and by the
</p>
<p>conviction that in Fitch they had a protector and influential inter-
</p>
<p>cessor with the powers that be. They knew that Fitch was on their
</p>
<p>side, that he had friends in high political place, that he had a
</p>
<p>"long head." They were certain "he would stick by them as long
</p>
<p>as he had any blood left in his body." Too, they were sure that they
</p>
<p>themselves would stick by one another and find shelter from the
</p>
<p>law in their common fraternity. They bragged of standing by one
</p>
<p>another "to swear any hostile witnesses to hell." As Bill Corwin
</p>
<p>put it: "They could prove that [a] horse was a blacksmith shop

</p>
<p>and every hair on him a candle if necessary." They counted on
</p>
<p>their ability to get witnesses of their own to clear them of any
</p>
<p>criminal complicity. They felt certain that no jury in Jackson
</p>
<p>County would ever convict them for any act against the railroad.
</p>
<p>[23]
</p>
<p>All these acts and declarations did not, however, add up to a
</p>
<p>conspiracy within the legal meaning of the term, as was later
</p>
<p>charged by the state. There was no organized gang with consti-
</p>
<p>tuted leadership that deliberately planned attacks on the railroad
</p>
<p>for a clearly conceived common end. The opposition to the Michi-
</p>
<p>gan Central in Jackson County was rather a loose and informal
</p>
<p>affair, with an open and reckless impulsiveness, entirely lacking in
</p>
<p>secrecy, compounded of common resentment, illegal intent, alco-
</p>
<p>holic spontaneity, and criminal acts. It verged on conspiracy but
</p>
<p>never quite jelled into the necessary consistency of purpose,
</p>
<p>method, and execution.
</p>
<p>This communal hostility to the railroad also had its roots in com-
</p>
<p>plaints other than those over the destruction of livestock. The ad-
</p>
<p>ditional sources of friction did not loom so large in the minds of
</p>
<p>those who frequented Filley's tavern or went out to stone the trains
</p>
<p>from Fitch's peach orchard. But elsewhere in Jackson County and
</p>
<p>in the state at large, they created strong resentment against the
</p>
<p>railroad, which together with the ill will engendered by the killing
</p>
<p>of cattle, was the basis of a broad antirailroad movement that
</p>
<p>sought publicly and legally to regulate and curb the powers of the
</p>
<p>offending corporation.
</p>
<p>Inevitable sources of friction were the condemnation proceed-
</p>
<p>ings for lands taken over for the right of way, stations, warehouses
</p>
<p>and shops, as well as the contract jobs for the construction of fences
</p>
<p>along the line of the road. Farmers invariably found the company's
</p>
<p>offers too low and the resultant court proceedings only served as
</p>
<p>irritants. Fences remained unbuilt or in some cases were even torn
</p>
<p>down. Even the man of God at Marshall, John D. Pierce, refused to
</p>
<p>build fence at the company's price of 5i-75 per one hundred rails.
</p>
<p>In the mind of one young farm laborer, the chief subject of dis-
</p>
<p>cussion at Michigan Centre during the many months he worked
</p>
<p>there was the company's wage policies. He remembered that there
</p>
<p>was something said about the railroad being a monopoly, and that
</p>
<p>a feeling was getting up against them because they hired help very
</p>
<p>cheap, did not pay wages enough, and had a tendency to render

</p>
<p>wages low. Once Fitch, elaborating on the complaints against the
</p>
<p>company, catalogued the whole list of its sins. He reiterated his
</p>
<p>charge that it was "a damned monopoly." He said he thought "the
</p>
<p>road was damned poorly managed and that a boy ten years old
</p>
<p>[24]
</p>
<p>would manage it better than Superintendent Brooks." He thought
</p>
<p>the chief engineer in charge of construction would be a better
</p>
<p>superintendent than Brooks, for he thought the company ought to
</p>
<p>pay for cattle killed. Fitch said the road carried produce from Niles
</p>
<p>as cheap as it did from Jackson, and that it had fixed the price
</p>
<p>of men at I500, referring to the amount paid to the widow of a
</p>
<p>man who had been killed by a train the year before at Galesburg.^^
</p>
<p>It was the charges of unfair freight rates and monopoly practices
</p>
<p>that were taken up most widely in the state. Jackson County ship-
</p>
<p>pers had complained of high rates back in 1846 when the state had
</p>
<p>owned the railroad. Then, in 1848, some shippers in Kalamazoo
</p>
<p>had protested to Superintendent Brooks against what they thought
</p>
<p>was unfair discrimination in the rates for carrying their produce to
</p>
<p>Detroit: the rates from Niles to Detroit were less than those from
</p>
<p>Kalamazoo to Detroit, a shorter haul by some fifty miles. Brooks, in
</p>
<p>a published pamphlet, justified the cheaper long-haul rate by the
</p>
<p>necessity of meeting water-shipping competition at Niles, which
</p>
<p>had access to Lake Michigan via the St. Joseph River. The cheaper
</p>
<p>rates and hence the greater volume of business from Niles, he
</p>
<p>argued, actually enabled the company to charge lower rates from
</p>
<p>Kalamazoo than would otherwise have been possible. In 1849, after
</p>
<p>the railroad had been finished to New Buffalo on the lake, the
</p>
<p>Whig American Citizen of Jackson, with no desire to ignore a pop-
</p>
<p>ular issue, took up the hue and cry. Its editor fulminated against
</p>
<p>the "dastardly course" the railroad had pursued in charging the
</p>
<p>citizens of the interior of the state nearly double the price charged
</p>
<p>those of other states for half the distance. Brooks evidently was
</p>
<p>fighting the lake shipping companies for the Chicago and Mil-
</p>
<p>waukee trade with the weapon of cheaper long hauls. But the
</p>
<p>Jackson editor could only see the "enormous charges" of the "Cen-
</p>
<p>tral railroad monopoly" which in his mind were responsible for
</p>
<p>the lower prices that local products brought and the bad state of
</p>
<p>business in general in Jackson County. He denounced the road as
</p>
<p>a "shameful monopoly" and a "humbug concern," and repeatedly
</p>
<p>urged the necessity of a connecting line from Jackson to the Mich-

<p>igan Southern Railroad at Adrian to give Jackson shippers another
</p>
<p>outlet to the east, at Monroe on Lake Erie, and thus break the
</p>
<p>monopoly of the Michigan Central.^s
</p>
<p>The accumulated grievances snowballed into a strong anti-
</p>
<p>[ 25 ]
</p>
<p>monopoly sentiment. Again and again, in the press, in the legis-
</p>
<p>lature, at meetings of citizens, and in Filley's tavern, the railroad
</p>
<p>was attacked as a corporate monopoly whose greed would not be
</p>
<p>satisfied until it had gobbled up the wealth of the state and the
</p>
<p>freedom of the people. Fitch and his friends, as we have seen, did
</p>
<p>not hide their feelings about the absolute corruption of this abso-
</p>
<p>lute economic power; one of the company's spies, in order to gain
</p>
<p>their confidence, found it advisable to talk "against the Road" and
</p>
<p>call it a monopoly. An angr)' citizen wTote a letter to the American
</p>
<p>Citizen, which, echoing the editorial opinion of the paper, rang
</p>
<p>the changes on the theme and demanded to know how long the
</p>
<p>people would suffer the railroad to dominate them. At Coldwater
</p>
<p>and at Napoleon, the citizens met to protest against the monopoly
</p>
<p>of the Michigan Central Railroad. In the legislature at Lansing,
</p>
<p>the drift of public opinion was crystallized in the warning that
</p>
<p>"the Michigan Central Railroad Company may possibly, sooner
</p>
<p>or later, discover that they did not make the State of Michigan,
</p>
<p>but that the State of Michigan made the company." -^
</p>
<p>Opposition to the Michigan Central's privileged position must
</p>
<p>have been strengthened by a decision of the Supreme Court of
</p>
<p>Michigan in July, 1851. A farmer in Wayne County had brought
</p>
<p>suit for damages against the company for horses that had been
</p>
<p>killed by a train. The county court sent the case up to the Supreme
</p>
<p>Court for adjudication, possibly as part of the same plan Super-
</p>
<p>intendent Brooks had offered to the citizens of Jackson County.
</p>
<p>The court decided. Judge Abner Pratt of Marshall writing the
</p>
<p>opinion, that the railroad was not bound by its charter or the
</p>
<p>common law to fence the right of way for the protection of other
</p>
<p>persons' domestic animals, and that inasmuch as the operation of
</p>
<p>trains was entirely lawful, it could not be held liable for accidental
</p>
<p>damage to property where no negligence on its part was proven.
</p>
<p>On the face of it, this decision seemed to bear out all of Fitch's
</p>
<p>accusations against the company and the courts. As one citizen ex-
</p>
<p>pressed it in a letter to the newspaper: "Railroad gold bought
</p>
<p>[the] decision." And even the Democratic paper in Jackson,

</p>
<p>though accepting the court's decision, felt moved to criticize the
</p>
<p>company for not going beyond the law and paying fair value for
</p>
<p>cattle killed in a newly settled state where the farmers could not
</p>
<p>possibly have enclosed pasturages for their livestock.^^
</p>
<p>[26 ]
</p>
<p>Judge Pratt, in denying the validity of one contention of the
</p>
<p>plaintiffs, suggested a method of redress. He held that the broader
</p>
<p>argument that the Michigan Central's charter "contains powers
</p>
<p>and privileges which were improvidently granted by the legisla-
</p>
<p>ture . . ." had no bearing on the case at hand. In thus limiting the
</p>
<p>competence of the court, he was suggesting that what the law-
</p>
<p>makers had given, only the lawmakers could take away. This con-
</p>
<p>clusion, which the opponents of the road had more than sensed
</p>
<p>heretofore, was now driven convincingly home. Their future
</p>
<p>course of action was ineluctably fixed a campaign to amend or
</p>
<p>even annul the railroad's charter, and in the name of justice, free-
</p>
<p>dom, and competition open the way for the general incorporation
</p>
<p>of all railroads under a system of public regulation. ^^
</p>
<p>The charter that the legislature had granted, or more precisely
</p>
<p>sold, to the Michigan Central Railroad in 1846 had indeed con-
</p>
<p>ferred monopoly power in perpetuity on the corporation. Though
</p>
<p>not without protest on democratic grounds against the lordly
</p>
<p>grant, on the one hand, and powerful financial pressures for it,
</p>
<p>on the other, the legislature had to a degree acted under the influ-
</p>
<p>ence of an older conception in creating a corporation with
</p>
<p>monopoly privileges. It had enfranchised a body politic to act for
</p>
<p>a desirable public end where the state had been unable to achieve
</p>
<p>that end. The corporation was, in theory certainly, an arm of the
</p>
<p>state, not yet wholly a mere business form, and as such entitled
</p>
<p>to the fullest measure of power and protection to enable it to
</p>
<p>realize its specific corporate aims. The rapid development of eco-
</p>
<p>nomic forces, the American conception of equality of opportunity
</p>
<p>for all, and the instinct that the state had no interests aside from
</p>
<p>those of the people soon brought this mercantilistic conception of
</p>
<p>the corporation under attack. Monopoly was reviled as oppres-
</p>
<p>sive and destructive of the rights of freeborn citizens; it stifled the
</p>
<p>development of a new country; only regulation by the people and
</p>
<p>competition through the multiplication of corporations were con-
</p>
<p>sonant with the ideals of this new-found land of liberty.^-
</p>
<p>John D. Pierce was voicing this point of view in 1849 when he

</p>
<p>coupled his attack on the railroad's policies with the contention
</p>
<p>that the legislature had no authority to confer on a corporation
</p>
<p>"rights, the exercise of which would bring them into daily collision
</p>
<p>and conflict with [the] citizens." In other words, he was arguing
</p>
<p>[27]
</p>
<p>that the actions of the company since its incorporation had been
</p>
<p>such as to invalidate its franchise. The next year, Pierce carried his
</p>
<p>fight from the newspapers to the constitutional convention where
</p>
<p>he served as a delegate from Calhoun County. He introduced the
</p>
<p>resolution which was later written into the article on corporations
</p>
<p>of the revised constitution, making possible the formation of cor-
</p>
<p>porations under general laws and forbidding the legislature to pass
</p>
<p>any individual acts of incorporation except municipal. This pro-
</p>
<p>vision, while not affecting those special charters already granted,
</p>
<p>was designed to prevent the issuance of corporate charters with
</p>
<p>special or monopoly privileges usually wrung from the legislature
</p>
<p>by political and financial pressures. It was also prompted by dis-
</p>
<p>gust with the dogfights of opjDOsing lobbies which besieged the
</p>
<p>legislature at each session, requesting new or protecting old char-
</p>
<p>ters, amidst loud charges of corruption. Thus, by constitutional
</p>
<p>action, the status of the corporation in Michigan was transformed
</p>
<p>from that of a privileged arm of the state to an ordinary business
</p>
<p>form accessible to all qualified applicants. While the state thereby
</p>
<p>lost its power of directing economic enterprise to desirable ends,
</p>
<p>it retained, in principle, its power to regulate business in the
</p>
<p>name of the public welfare.^^
</p>
<p>The new constitution as adopted also forbade the renewal or
</p>
<p>extension of corporate charters previously granted and removed
</p>
<p>the thirty year period of grace within which these charters could
</p>
<p>not be amended. With no success, Delegate Pierce tried to make a
</p>
<p>general incorporation law for all business enterprise part of the
</p>
<p>constitution in order to give positive effect to the mandatory pro-
</p>
<p>vision. And he fought generally, though in vain, to curb the powers
</p>
<p>of the corporate monopolies. He insisted on holding up the public
</p>
<p>interest as the supreme criterion of the right to a corporate exist-
</p>
<p>ence. "When a charter becomes detrimental to the public interest,"
</p>
<p>he asserted in the constitutional debates, "it ceases to answer the
</p>
<p>professed end of its creator, and may and ought to be repealed. . .
</p>
<p>Those vested rights, created by charters, must yield, when they
</p>
<p>come in conflict with the supreme law the public good." Re-

<p>membering his own and others' losses of cattle. Pierce also intro-
</p>
<p>duced a resolution providing that "In all cases where damage is
</p>
<p>done by any corporation to private property, the corporation shall
</p>
<p>pay to the full amount of such damage." When this resolution was
</p>
<p>[28]
</p>
<p>buried in committee, Pierce later offered an amendment to the
</p>
<p>article on corporations to the same effect, but that too failed of
</p>
<p>adoption.^-i
</p>
<p>The railroad interests were also able to fend off regulatory at-
</p>
<p>tacks in the legislatures of 1850 and 1851. These attacks were led
</p>
<p>by Michael Shoemaker, who owned a flour mill in Michigan Centre
</p>
<p>and represented Jackson County in the state senate. As chairman
</p>
<p>pro tem of the senate and chairman of its committee on incorpora-
</p>
<p>tions, he was a figure of some importance in Democratic councils.
</p>
<p>Twice, in 1850 and in 1851, he introduced a bill to provide for
</p>
<p>police regulations along the line of the railroads, requiring the
</p>
<p>companies to fence their roads, build cattle guards at crossings
</p>
<p>and maintain warning signs there, and put bells on the locomo-
</p>
<p>tives. Shoemaker stated that the object of his bill was to "protect
</p>
<p>our farmers from the loss of their cattle by being run over by
</p>
<p>trains of cars." The opponents of the bill necessarily approved of
</p>
<p>this worthy aim but insisted that it infringed on vested rights, de-
</p>
<p>spite the opinion of the attorney general to the contrary. The bill
</p>
<p>passed the senate twice but was twice defeated in the lower house
</p>
<p>by the influence of the railroad lobbyists.^^
</p>
<p>Fitch, too, spent two or three weeks in Lansing in 1851 as self-
</p>
<p>appointed lobbyist for the people, using whatever influence he had
</p>
<p>to support any measures that would put pressure on the Michigan
</p>
<p>Central. He undoubtedly worked hard to get Shoemaker's bill
</p>
<p>passed. He joined forces with those who were trying to get a rail-
</p>
<p>road built from Jackson to Adrian to give Jackson an alternate
</p>
<p>outlet for its products. The completion of this railroad, which had
</p>
<p>been chartered in 1836 as the Palmyra and Jacksonburg and had
</p>
<p>been built only to Tecumseh, had been required of the Michigan
</p>
<p>Southern by the terms of its original charter. The Southern, how-
</p>
<p>ever, had done nothing, and the Jackson interests, led by Amos
</p>
<p>Root, merchant, now in 1851 exerted themselves to get it to carry
</p>
<p>out this part of its charter. For its part, the Southern had no par-
</p>
<p>ticular interest in the Jackson Branch, as the projected road was
</p>
<p>known. But it was now engaged in a race with the Michigan Cen-

</p>
<p>tral to push through to Chicago, and the two rival roads were
</p>
<p>fighting each other in the legislatures of Michigan, Indiana, and
</p>
<p>Illinois. John Stryker, chief of the Southern Railroad lobby, ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly held out the bait of the Jackson Branch to the Jackson
</p>
<p>[29]
</p>
<p>County people to get their support for his own bill to allow the
</p>
<p>Southern to leave the state of Michigan on the road to Chicago.
</p>
<p>Root, Fitch, and the others were not loath to give Stryker this sup-
</p>
<p>port and use the Southern Railroad as a cudgel in their own fight
</p>
<p>with the Michigan Central. ^s
</p>
<p>Stryker was not able to muster the necessary two-thirds majority
</p>
<p>for his amendment to the Southern's charter. He then shifted his
</p>
<p>strategy and backed a general railroad incorporation law requiring
</p>
<p>only an ordinary majority vote, planning to get the connection
</p>
<p>with Indiana under such a law. The Jackson foes of the Michigan
</p>
<p>Central wholeheartedly supported this move, it being entirely in
</p>
<p>accord with their own plans too. Shoemaker of Jackson reported
</p>
<p>out such a bill from his committee, but here too, the Central forces
</p>
<p>under the leadership of James F. Joy were able to defeat it.^^
</p>
<p>The Michigan Central Railroad, it seems, had much greater suc-
</p>
<p>cess in coping with its opponents in Lansing than with those in
</p>
<p>Jackson County who were determined to bring it to terms by vio-
</p>
<p>lence. The summer of 1850 had come and almost gone and Super-
</p>
<p>intendent Brooks had not as yet been able to apprehend any of the
</p>
<p>criminals. The situation became, if not desperate, measurably ag-
</p>
<p>gravated as the railroad's troubles were bruited about in the East
</p>
<p>and began to drive travel to the lake steamers. The whole task of
</p>
<p>ferreting out the depredators and collecting enough evidence to
</p>
<p>convict them required more attention than Brooks could spare
</p>
<p>from his large duties. Different and more thorough methods would
</p>
<p>be necessary to breach the protective community-consciousness of
</p>
<p>the men of Michigan Centre, Leoni, and Grass Lake.
</p>
<p>Brooks' first step was to hire, some time in the summer of 1850,
</p>
<p>Darius Clark of Marshall to undertake the job of catching the
</p>
<p>felons. Clark was an experienced business man, a member of the
</p>
<p>firm of Nash and Clark of Marshall, contractors who had done
</p>
<p>construction work for the railroad in western Michigan. He was a
</p>
<p>quiet, likable man, not hitherto mixed up in the controversy, and
</p>
<p>unknown to the "conspirators." He got to work in August and
</p>
<p>hired a number of agents who were to operate secretly at Michigan

</p>
<p>Centre. Some were friends or employees of his from Marshall who
</p>
<p>went to the Centre and worked there in one fictitious capacity or
</p>
<p>another. Others were men from Jackson and vicinity who were put
</p>
<p>to watching the tracks at two dollars a night in the troubled area.
</p>
<p>[30]
</p>
<p>Still others went to the Centre on a full-time basis and lived and
</p>
<p>worked there, watching, talking, listening, drinking, and making
</p>
<p>reports. Clark also used the railroad's money, men, and facilities
</p>
<p>to seek out persons who had lived in or near Michigan Centre
</p>
<p>during the trouble and had since moved away, in order to get them
</p>
<p>to tell what they knew.^^
</p>
<p>In a short time, Clark was directing a small organization of secret
</p>
<p>agents or spies, or "colonists," as John Murray Forbes, president of
</p>
<p>the railroad, liked to call them, who met their chief at intervals in
</p>
<p>Jackson, Marshall, or Detroit and made reports and affidavits as to
</p>
<p>their findings. Clark reported on his progress directly to Brooks in
</p>
<p>Detroit, sometimes in person and sometimes by messenger. His
</p>
<p>written reports show that he worked slowly and cautiously but
</p>
<p>determinedly. "Time and deliberation will surely do it," he ad-
</p>
<p>vised Brooks. "There is nothing gained in pushing this thing fast,"
</p>
<p>he assured his anxious superior, and kept stressing the need for
</p>
<p>absolute secrecy on the part of all concerned.^^
</p>
<p>Not being a lawyer, Clark got the judge of the Circuit Court of
</p>
<p>Jackson County and ipso facto a member of the Supreme Court of
</p>
<p>Michigan, Abner Pratt, of Marshall, to help him to evaluate the
</p>
<p>evidence. Pratt, who was to write the Supreme Court decision ab-
</p>
<p>solving the railroad of liability for property damage little more
</p>
<p>than a year hence, took hold of the matter "with his usual energy."
</p>
<p>By the middle of August, he was assuring Clark that he had enough
</p>
<p>evidence for a strong case, with the latter insisting cautiously that
</p>
<p>it was not enough. Soon Pratt was saying with what degree of
</p>
<p>judicial impartiality is difficult to surmise that "if it is all right he
</p>
<p>will guarantee a conviction." Clark still demurred: "I am not so
</p>
<p>confident yet." By the end of August, as the evidence kept coming
</p>
<p>in, the judge told Clark that conspiracy charges were the best
</p>
<p>method of attack and actually drew up the form of an indictment
</p>
<p>for conspiracy against Fitch and the others, and sent it to the
</p>
<p>prosecuting attorney of Jackson County to be used before the
</p>
<p>grand jury at the proper time. By November, Clark was "in hopes"
</p>
<p>that he had sufficient evidence to spring the trap, and halt the in-

</p>
<p>creasing number of accidents that now plagued the trains in the
</p>
<p>vicinity of Michigan Centre. First, however, he wrote Brooks that
</p>
<p>he would like to show him what evidence he had so far, as though
</p>
<p>to have Brooks dispel whatever doubts he, Clark, might have,
</p>
<p>[31 ]
</p>
<p>adding that he expected more "would be brought out on a trial." ^^
</p>
<p>Clark's instinctive caution got the upper hand and no arrests
</p>
<p>were made at the time. A new and unlocked for contingency, the
</p>
<p>destruction by fire of the freight depot in Detroit, changed the
</p>
<p>whole aspect of the case and demanded further and more thorough
</p>
<p>investigation. In any case, a large part of the evidence thus far ob-
</p>
<p>tained was indirect, consisting of admissions by Fitch and his
</p>
<p>friends to the agents, and hence highly vulnerable in court. The
</p>
<p>amount of direct proof was understandably small, in view of the
</p>
<p>secrecy in which the road's enemies cloaked their operations. The
</p>
<p>entire investigation, moreover, was greatly hampered when one of
</p>
<p>Clark's chief agents was early discovered and exposed as a spy.
</p>
<p>All the other agents were then sooner or later compromised as the
</p>
<p>Centreites came to suspect anybody and everybody who had not for
</p>
<p>years been a resident of the community. And the doubled caution
</p>
<p>of Fitch and his fellows made the procurement of further direct
</p>
<p>evidence by other spies commensurately difficult. Fitch, undoubt-
</p>
<p>edly the brains of the group, became exceedingly cautious, "know-
</p>
<p>ing as [he] did that large rewards had been ofEered for [his] convic-
</p>
<p>tion and that secret spyes were laying in wait for [him]."^i
</p>
<p>It was at this point that William D. Wescott, the exposed spy,
</p>
<p>greatly aided Clark by making available new sources of informa-
</p>
<p>tion. Wescott was one of the first agents that Clark hired and at
</p>
<p>the time, in August, 1850, was a clerk in a hotel in Jackson, about
</p>
<p>to take a job as a guard in the state prison there. He had behind
</p>
<p>him a nondescript career as barkeep and unsuccessful business man
</p>
<p>in Nankin, Wayne County, and up north at Mackinac, where he
</p>
<p>had been under indictment for forgery. Of shrewd though limited
</p>
<p>intelligence, he had probably been referred to Clark by the rail-
</p>
<p>road officials in Jackson because he had lived in Michigan Centre
</p>
<p>in the spring of the year and still went there on Sundays to see his
</p>
<p>wife who boarded with her father.
</p>
<p>Clark first had to get Wescott temporarily released from his
</p>
<p>prison job. Brooks wrote Justus Goodwin, superintendent of the
</p>
<p>prison, asking for Wescott's services for the railroad "for a couple

</p>
<p>of weeks or so" without revealing the purpose beyond the assur-
</p>
<p>ance that "he would be of most essential service to us, and prob-
</p>
<p>ably to the public, in the furtherance of some matters of public
</p>
<p>interest as well as of the interest of the company." Goodwin oblig-
</p>
<p>[32 ]
</p>
<p>ingly released Wescott, pointedly informing Brooks that the
</p>
<p>"scoundrels" in Leoni Township had aroused nothing but indig-
</p>
<p>nation in Jackson. Clark thereupon put Wescott on the payroll
</p>
<p>as a secret agent at S40 a month, even though he could not alto-
</p>
<p>gether overcome his distrust of the man. He had not been too well
</p>
<p>impressed in talking to him and doubted his integrity. He sus-
</p>
<p>pected him of "playing a double game" and did not like the fact
</p>
<p>that Wescott "call[ed] for money the first thing." ^2
</p>
<p>Wescott went to Michigan Centre on August 19 to live with his
</p>
<p>father-in-law. He spent his days talking and drinking with the boys
</p>
<p>and "laying out at nights" in Fitch's and Filley's yards, along the
</p>
<p>track, or eavesdropping under Fitch's windows. He let it be known
</p>
<p>that he was taking a long rest at Michigan Centre because he was
</p>
<p>tired of tending bar and "it was too hard for him to be up so much
</p>
<p>nights." At the tavern, he talked against the railroad, called it a
</p>
<p>monopoly, and advertised his hard feelings in order to gain his
</p>
<p>listeners' confidence. Fitch called him "one of the boys" and the
</p>
<p>accolade was confirmed by a drink on the part of all present. Wes-
</p>
<p>cott was soon on quite intimate terms with Fitch; the latter invited
</p>
<p>him to his parlor to eat fruit and drink cherry whiskey and brandy
</p>
<p>and confided all that had been done and all that was planned
</p>
<p>against the railroad. He had so far advanced in the good graces of
</p>
<p>Fitch that the latter actually proposed to him to take over and run
</p>
<p>Filley's tavern. Fitch assured him he would make money and said
</p>
<p>it would accommodate him and his friends to have it kept up bet-
</p>
<p>ter than Filley kept it.
</p>
<p>Wescott was thus in a position to gather much information for
</p>
<p>his employer on the sentiments expressed, the crimes committed,
</p>
<p>and those planned at the Centre. He must have greatly endeared
</p>
<p>himself to Clark and Brooks when he warned of a projected "grand
</p>
<p>smash" at the time of the state fair in Ann Arbor in September,
</p>
<p>1850. He reported to Clark that Fitch had told him that he and the
</p>
<p>boys were determined to bring the company to terms before the
</p>
<p>state fair was over; that he. Fitch, meant to show the people of
</p>
<p>Michigan that the feeling against the company did not exist alone

<p>in Leoni by throwing off the cars all the way from west of Jackson
</p>
<p>to east of Grass Lake; that they hoped to kill 100 to 150 passengers
</p>
<p>during the fair and if that failed, to burn the railroad depots at
</p>
<p>Detroit, Ann Arbor, Jackson, and Niles. He further revealed that
</p>
<p>[33 ]
</p>
<p>Filley planned to throw off a train at the Dry Marsh where the
</p>
<p>dead passengers would be buried so deep in the mud that there
</p>
<p>would be no need of coffins or sexton. The whole murderous plan,
</p>
<p>according to Wescott, was to be climaxed by a demand of $100,000
</p>
<p>blackmail from the company to call off the attack. Wescott's hor-
</p>
<p>rendous report led to immediate action. A special train was sent
</p>
<p>out before the fair began and nearly a hundred special watchmen
</p>
<p>were stationed along the track at the threatened points. Clark and
</p>
<p>Brooks were certain that this timely action forced the conspirators
</p>
<p>to give up their evil design and credited Wescott with saving the
</p>
<p>railroad from destruction.
</p>
<p>It was not long before Wescott's real purpose at the Centre was
</p>
<p>discovered. Once or twice he had narrowly escaped being caught
</p>
<p>on his nightly prowls, but his luck ran out after he had been at the
</p>
<p>Centre not more than a few weeks. One evening early in Septem-
</p>
<p>ber, Benjamin Gleason, who was a friend of Fitch and who worked
</p>
<p>at the state prison, came down to the Centre to see him. Fitch,
</p>
<p>Filley, Wescott, and a fourth were playing euchre in the parlor.
</p>
<p>Gleason called Fitch out of the room and told him that he had
</p>
<p>seen a letter at the prison in which Brooks asked for Wescott's
</p>
<p>services and that he was probably a railroad spy. Fitch went back
</p>
<p>and called Filley into consulation. Wescott sensed that something
</p>
<p>was up. When Fitch and Filley returned the game was resumed, but
</p>
<p>there was a coolness in the air and they did not play euchre much
</p>
<p>longer that night.
</p>
<p>A few days later, Gleason came down once more and this time
</p>
<p>produced Brooks' letter to Goodwin. It was not certain proof of
</p>
<p>Wescott's treachery but showed that he was working for the rail-
</p>
<p>road in some capacity. Gleason summarily accused Wescott of
</p>
<p>being "a damned railroad spy" who ought to have his throat cut.
</p>
<p>Filley confronted the suspect the next day with Gleason's evidence
</p>
<p>but he coolly denied he was a spy. Fitch called Wescott to his house
</p>
<p>and asked him if Brooks had employed him as a spy. When he
</p>
<p>denied the accusation. Fitch asked him to explain away the letter.
</p>
<p>Wescott, thinking fast, answered that Brooks had hired him to

</p>
<p>trace a trunk that one of the railroad's patrons claimed had been
</p>
<p>lost. Fitch was incredulous and said the company had bigger busi-
</p>
<p>ness to look after and that the letter was proof enough for him
</p>
<p>that he, Wescott, was a spy. The latter then suggested, with more
</p>
<p>[34]
</p>
<p>audacity than cunning, that Fitch go to Detroit and check the
</p>
<p>matter with Brooks.
</p>
<p>Knowledge of Brooks' letter sufficed to convince most of the
</p>
<p>patrons of Filley's that Wescott was a spy. They avoided him but
</p>
<p>did not fail to let him know in one way or another what they would
</p>
<p>do to spies in general and him in particular if he were ever to
</p>
<p>testify against them. Fitch threatened to shoot him on the stand
</p>
<p>and if he couldn't do it himself, "by God, he had friends enough
</p>
<p>that would do it." The boys added their own threats to Fitch's
</p>
<p>and declared that they would shoot a spy as quick as they would a
</p>
<p>dog. Later, they discussed a plan to bludgeon Wescott to death and
</p>
<p>made sure that Joshua Wells, Wescott's brother-in-law, overheard
</p>
<p>them. Wells, as expected, carried the news to Wescott and the lat-
</p>
<p>ter immediately informed his employers that his life was in danger.
</p>
<p>He even told Clark that he himself had crawled under the floor of
</p>
<p>Filley's tavern and heard his life auctioned off for $100. Clark,
</p>
<p>realizing that the man's usefulness was at an end, gave him a job
</p>
<p>in the depot at Detroit. This did not prevent Wescott from carry-
</p>
<p>ing on officiously as a self-styled detective, but by March, 1851,
</p>
<p>even Clark had had enough of him. He asked that Wescott be
</p>
<p>given something to do that would "keep him off the railroad en-
</p>
<p>tirely," giving as his reasons that the fellow just could not get
</p>
<p>along with the other men working on the case. A little later, Clark
</p>
<p>kept the irrespressible Wescott from making a trip east in search
</p>
<p>of information because he felt that his lack of discretion might
</p>
<p>harm the whole investigation.^^
</p>
<p>Before Wescott had left the Centre, he had been able to do a
</p>
<p>great service for his employers. He persuaded two young men of the
</p>
<p>place to come out and tell all they knew on the promise of good
</p>
<p>jobs with the company. In September, he got Horace Caswell, a
</p>
<p>young laborer who had never had more than odd jobs at the Centre,
</p>
<p>to go to work at the railroad depot in Detroit. Two months later,
</p>
<p>Caswell was making out affidavits to help build up the company's
</p>
<p>case against the conspirators. In November, Wescott told his young
</p>
<p>brother-in-law, Joshua Wells, of his own work with the railroad

</p>
<p>and promised him he should have a good situation if he would
</p>
<p>come out and be a man. Wells accepted the offer and was also
</p>
<p>placed in the Detroit depot, and soon thereafter began to provide
</p>
<p>Clark with valuable evidence. Both he and Caswell were able to
</p>
<p>[35]
</p>
<p>incriminate Fitch himself by telling how he had given them his
</p>
<p>pistols to use in shooting at a train, although they never had ac-
</p>
<p>tually discharged them.
</p>
<p>One other young resident of the Centre, however, proved not so
</p>
<p>pliable as Wells and Caswell and was to suffer for his obduracy.
</p>
<p>Miner Lay cock, scarcely twenty-one years old, also jumped at the
</p>
<p>opportunity to go to work for the railroad in Detroit, but when he
</p>
<p>found out it meant betraying his friends at Michigan Centre, re-
</p>
<p>fused to talk and was summarily dismissed. He later was arrested
</p>
<p>with the other "railroad conspirators" and spent six months in jail.
</p>
<p>Of all those to turn state's evidence, Jacob Wolliver delivered
</p>
<p>the most damaging blows to Fitch and company. Wolliver had
</p>
<p>lived at Leoni during the summer of 1850 and worked for Filley
</p>
<p>most of the time, tending bar, trapping pigeons, fishing for pickerel,
</p>
<p>and doing odd jobs. Filley called him his "devil" and had always
</p>
<p>found him ready to go out and tear up a piece of track or stone
</p>
<p>the trains, especially after he had been fortified by some of Filley's
</p>
<p>whiskey, to which he had free access with no questions asked. Along
</p>
<p>about the fall of the year, Wolliver succumbed to the blandish-
</p>
<p>ments of the railroad and accepted a job at Albion. As he was about
</p>
<p>to leave, he found himself at odds with his employer, Filley, over
</p>
<p>the amount of his wages, claiming that he was not being paid
</p>
<p>enough and that he was being charged for more whiskey than he
</p>
<p>had consumed. The two finally compromised on a deduction of
</p>
<p>six to eight dollars for a barrel of whiskey, but Wolliver left dis-
</p>
<p>satisfied, even after Fitch himself had called him in and tried to
</p>
<p>mollify him, realizing that Wolliver knew too much to leave the
</p>
<p>Centre with any ill will. From Albion, word soon came to Filley
</p>
<p>that Wolliver was going to testify against his former employer and
</p>
<p>friends. Filley was not too concerned over the prospect of Wolliver's
</p>
<p>betrayal for he was sure that they "could swear him to hell." He
</p>
<p>went to Albion, nevertheless, to caution him not to talk, for he
</p>
<p>felt that a little caution "went a damned ways" sometimes. Filley
</p>
<p>reinforced his warning vnth a threat, but Wolliver had made up
</p>
<p>his mind to reveal all and was able to give Clark some direct first-

</p>
<p>hand evidence of attacks on the road by himself in company with
</p>
<p>the boys.
</p>
<p>The defection of their own kind and the exposure of Wescott
</p>
<p>embittered the boys to the point of overweening suspicion. They
</p>
<p>[36 ]
</p>
<p>reiterated with vigor their threats against spies and ranted of the
</p>
<p>murderous means they would use to stop the mouths of informers.
</p>
<p>At times, the more volatile of them, in the heat of argument or in
</p>
<p>their cups, even let their hatred and suspicion explode into brutal
</p>
<p>violence against someone they distrusted or merely disliked.
</p>
<p>One of the strangers in their midst they soon figured to be a spy,
</p>
<p>and correctly so, was Harvey Dixon, who came from Marshall and
</p>
<p>posed as a wheat buyer for a Detroit firm. Dixon stupidly gave
</p>
<p>himself away by paying too much for his purchases and had to leave
</p>
<p>after a brief and unfruitful stay at the Centre. The morning he
</p>
<p>left. Jack Freeland sent him off with a bitter tirade.
</p>
<p>There's that damned wheat buyer you didn't buy my wheat did you?
</p>
<p>God damn you I didn't mean you should. I thought you was feeding soft
</p>
<p>soap, and I eat a good deal of that before I came to this country. I didn't
</p>
<p>speak to you did I? I didn't mean to, for I didn't like your looks.
</p>
<p>Even an innocent like Hiram Dexter, who came to the Centre to
</p>
<p>build the ball alley outside Filley's tavern, was suspected of spying
</p>
<p>for the railroad and was warned that he had better be careful and
</p>
<p>not offend any of the boys lest they knock him over. And when old
</p>
<p>Alonzo Holmes, who boarded the track hands at his house, of-
</p>
<p>fended Orlando Williams, that hothead brutally assaulted the help-
</p>
<p>less old man. There had been some talk of Holmes and his wife
</p>
<p>being spies and it was proposed to tar and feather the couple. Su-
</p>
<p>spicion had somewhat abated, when, one day in August, 1850,
</p>
<p>Williams accused Holmes once more. Holmes was sitting on the
</p>
<p>steps at Filley's chatting, when Williams came up, pulled the old
</p>
<p>man off the steps and shouted, "They do say you are a railroad
</p>
<p>spy." Holmes coolly replied, "It's nobody's business if I am." Sub-
</p>
<p>sequently, inside the tavern, at the bar, Williams picked up a bottle
</p>
<p>and yelled at Holmes, "You are a damned pusillanimous." (This
</p>
<p>can only be the court reporter's substitution for profanity, a la
</p>
<p>Hemingway.) When Holmes replied, "You are a ditto," Williams
</p>
<p>threw the bottle at his head and broke the old man's jaw, knocking
</p>
<p>him unconscious. Williams later boasted in Morrison's grocery at
</p>
<p>Jackson that he had "nearly laid out one damned spy and wished

</p>
<p>to God he had killed him." He added he would kill a railroad spy
</p>
<p>quicker that he would a "massasauger." Another time, Williams'
</p>
<p>nasty temper brought him to blows with William Dobbs, whom he
</p>
<p>did not like because he had refused to join the boys in an attempt
</p>
<p>[37 ]
</p>
<p>to nail a plank on the track. Even Fitch had afterward sneeringly
</p>
<p>asked Dobbs if he were going to engage with the company the
</p>
<p>next season. It was at Warner's grocery in Jackson that Williams
</p>
<p>and Dobbs got into an argument over the comparative sizes of a
</p>
<p>gold dollar and a five-cent piece. Williams flared up and dared
</p>
<p>Dobbs into the back room to fight, calling him a "damned scoun-
</p>
<p>drel" and telling him he would whip any man engaged with the
</p>
<p>railroad company. This time, Williams himself was "whaled
</p>
<p>slightly" and may thereby have had his suspicions of Dobbs dis-
</p>
<p>pelled.
</p>
<p>One of the spies, Hiram Sherman, was with great cunning able
</p>
<p>to parry the distrust of the Centreites and neatly turn the tables
</p>
<p>on them, trapping two of them in a criminal act. Sherman was a
</p>
<p>longtime resident of Leoni village and was hired by Clark early
</p>
<p>in October at a wage of I25 a month. He went to the village to
</p>
<p>work for one of the farmers there and was duly suspected of being
</p>
<p>a spy. One day, at Filley's, he spoke of quitting his job on the farm
</p>
<p>and Bill Corwin taunted him, "I suppose you think you can make
</p>
<p>more by laying out at nights." Sherman's chance to return to grace
</p>
<p>came not long afterward. He was present at the ball alley outside
</p>
<p>the tavern when Corwin got into an argument with John Palmer.
</p>
<p>The two began twitting each other and finally had a clinch, with
</p>
<p>Palmer backing Corwin against the wall. Sherman stepped in be-
</p>
<p>tween the two and held Palmer off. After the fight had been broken
</p>
<p>up, Sherman and his new friend, Corwin, went out to an old rail-
</p>
<p>road car standing on the track nearby and made up in a burst of
</p>
<p>mutual confidence. As Sherman later described their conversation:
</p>
<p>I told him I knew he thought I was watching for the railroad, told him I
</p>
<p>was watching for the road, but that whatever he said to me, he need not
</p>
<p>fear me going to the road with it, that he knew me well enough for that . . .
</p>
<p>that I could watch on his side as well as for Mr. Clark and the road, and
</p>
<p>could tell him what the company was doing . . . told him I watched for
</p>
<p>money and did not care anything for the road more than to get their
</p>
<p>money . . . told him I would do anything I could for them.
</p>
<p>Corwin was completely won over by this frank confession. He said

</p>
<p>all he wanted was that Sherman should let them know what the
</p>
<p>company was doing and be on their side and didn't care how much
</p>
<p>money he got out of the company. Sherman then cleverly warned
</p>
<p>Corwin not to give his game away to Clark for then he would be
</p>
<p>[38]
</p>
<p>discharged and would not be paid for what he had already done.
</p>
<p>Corwin assured him he would tell no one but Fitch.
</p>
<p>Early that November, Sherman's new loyalties were put to the
</p>
<p>test. As he later told the story, Corwin approached him in Jackson
</p>
<p>and asked him to help steal some barrels of flour that night from
</p>
<p>the freight cars sidetracked at the Centre. The plan was to set fire
</p>
<p>to a pile of lumber as a diversion, and, while the railroad police
</p>
<p>were busy with the fire, steal the flour. Corwin added that if
</p>
<p>Sherman did not join him, he must keep still, but that he and Eben
</p>
<p>Price were going ahead with the plan anyway. Sherman agreed to
</p>
<p>join the two. Before he returned to Michigan Centre, however, he
</p>
<p>revealed the plan to the railroad officials in Jackson.
</p>
<p>According to Sherman's account, the three met that night in the
</p>
<p>tavern at the Centre and imbibed some liquid courage. Filley asked
</p>
<p>them if they were going fishing and Corwin in reply merely asked
</p>
<p>him if he had an old ax and then went and got it. Price then com-
</p>
<p>plained that he hadn't "the first damned thing to fight with" in
</p>
<p>case of trouble so Filley gave him a knife. As the three left, Filley
</p>
<p>wished them good luck and told them if they wanted anything after
</p>
<p>they got back, there was the bottle. On the way to the lumber pile,
</p>
<p>Corwin suggested turning the switch but realized they had no tools
</p>
<p>for that task and Price cautioned, "One thing at a time; we will burn
</p>
<p>the wood tonight." When the little group arrived at the woodpile,
</p>
<p>they reconnoitered the area a bit. Price nervously suggested, "If
</p>
<p>any one comes we will run to the woods." Corwin replied he would
</p>
<p>"be damned if he'd run" and told Price he'd better stick by him
</p>
<p>and fight it out. As they set the fire, Sherman kept looking around
</p>
<p>nervously for the police he expected to be on hand. He soon saw
</p>
<p>what he was looking for several men crawling along the ground
</p>
<p>nearby. Relieved, he rejoined Price and Corwin, and a moment
</p>
<p>later, the three were arrested and taken to the jail in Jackson.
</p>
<p>At long last, it seemed that Clark had the best kind of evidence
</p>
<p>against at least two of the road's enemies and would be able to send
</p>
<p>them to jail. The grand jury, after some "higgling," brought an
</p>
<p>indictment against the three. Corwin and Price pleaded not guilty.

</p>
<p>Bail was fixed at $1,000 each and loyal Ammi Filley promptly gave
</p>
<p>bond for his two friends. Sherman, too, was released on bail offered
</p>
<p>by a railroad official. The trial was set for the March term of
</p>
<p>court.^*
</p>
<p>[39]
</p>
<p>Pending the trial, Sherman returned to the Centre but did not
</p>
<p>stay long for his treachery was known. Fitch pointed him out one
</p>
<p>day to a group at the tavern and said, "There is one of the damned
</p>
<p>railroad spies, just such men as they get to watch the road and bum
</p>
<p>the company's wood." Turning to Corwin and Price, Fitch sardon-
</p>
<p>ically continued:
</p>
<p>Boys, I should think you would remember Sherman in your prayers, if
</p>
<p>you don't go to bed till late. I should, if he had been in company with
</p>
<p>me and had turned traitor. If he had turned traitor to me, I should like
</p>
<p>to finger my knife around his ribs.
</p>
<p>Sherman left soon after for the safety of a job in the railroad
</p>
<p>warehouse at Marshall at one dollar a day. At the Centre, mean-
</p>
<p>while, alibis were being prepared and public opinion was being
</p>
<p>educated. Sherman was described as a tool of the railroad who
</p>
<p>under orders had entrapped innocent men and instigated the
</p>
<p>whole venture; he had gotten Corwin so drunk that he had had to
</p>
<p>lead him to the lumber pile and then set fire to it himself. Corwin
</p>
<p>told Caleb Loud, the dealer in horse medicine, that they never
</p>
<p>would bring him to trial for burning the wood; if they did, they
</p>
<p>could not convict him, as they had witnesses enough to swear him
</p>
<p>clear. He asked Loud to use his influence for him by talking among
</p>
<p>the farmers south of Jackson before the trial.
</p>
<p>As the day of the trial approached, Clark became convinced that
</p>
<p>it had better be postponed. He preferred not to "stir up the ire of
</p>
<p>Michigan Centre" just yet. He had come to share the belief of his
</p>
<p>new legal adviser whom he had hired in December, John Van
</p>
<p>Arman, the astute criminal lawyer from Marshall, that these men
</p>
<p>could never be convicted in Jackson County. James F. Joy, the
</p>
<p>company's chief counsel, did not share Clark's hesitation and
</p>
<p>wished to bring the men to trial as scheduled, hoping to draw out
</p>
<p>information in the course of the trial of the two that could be
</p>
<p>effectively used against the rest of the group. Clark insisted that
</p>
<p>nothing new could thus be uncovered that he could not get from
</p>
<p>his secret agents. He did join Joy, nevertheless, in a bold plan to
</p>
<p>get the case removed from the jurisdiction of the judge of the

</p>
<p>Jackson County court. Legislation to effect this change of venue
</p>
<p>was necessary, and Clark and Joy went to work to get it, the former
</p>
<p>in his new capacity as member of the house of representatives from
</p>
<p>Calhoun County. With the aid of the state attorney general and the
</p>
<p>[40]
</p>
<p>prosecuting attorney for Jackson County, they pushed through a
</p>
<p>bill in the 1851 session of the legislature which provided for the
</p>
<p>removal of criminal cases from the county courts to the circuit
</p>
<p>courts at the option of the prosecuting attorney as well as that of
</p>
<p>the defendants.^^
</p>
<p>Despite this legislative victory, the case of Corwin and Price
</p>
<p>never was brought to trial. Clark really had bigger fish to fry. His
</p>
<p>comparative indifEerence to the case of the two who had set fire
</p>
<p>to some railroad lumber was prompted by his greater interest in a
</p>
<p>bigger charge of arson which he hoped to pin on the whole cabal
</p>
<p>at Michigan Centre. As he explained to Brooks in March, 1851,
</p>
<p>"I think these [two] fellows had better be kept along and come in
</p>
<p>with the others, it will be less trouble and expense and in making
</p>
<p>the main thing more sure." ^^
</p>
<p>The "main thing" referred to the destruction of the freight
</p>
<p>depot in Detroit less than two weeks after Corwin and Price were
</p>
<p>arrested. Early on the morning of November 19, 1850, the Mich-
</p>
<p>igan Central freight house in Detroit, built less than a year before,
</p>
<p>burned to the ground with all its stores of flour, wheat, and corn.
</p>
<p>The loss to the company was estimated at $40,000 which was not
</p>
<p>covered by insurance, and the value of the stored freight was more
</p>
<p>than $100,000. One Detroit newspaper said the next day that, gen-
</p>
<p>erally, the cause of the fire remained a matter of conjecture. The
</p>
<p>report added, however, that
</p>
<p>the more generally prevalent opinion of those employed about the build-
</p>
<p>ing-s seemed to be that it took from the friction of the elevators, which
</p>
<p>theory is somewhat strengthened by the locaHty at which the fire burst
</p>
<p>out. Suggestions have been made that the fire was the work of incen-
</p>
<p>diaries, but that opinion is not general nor is it materially substantiated
</p>
<p>by the facts.
</p>
<p>Van Arman later contended for the company that this report to
</p>
<p>the press had been deliberately falsified and that the depot hands
</p>
<p>knew full well that the fire was incendiary in origin, the contrary
</p>
<p>opinion having been circulated in order to allay the suspicion of
</p>
<p>the criminals. This stratagem may explain, too, the failure of Su-

<p>perintendent Brooks publicly to offer a reward for the apprehen-
</p>
<p>sion of those who burned the depot. The feeling will not down,
</p>
<p>nevertheless, that the fire may have been an accident and was con-
</p>
<p>sidered such by the railroad officials until some months later when
</p>
<p>[41 ]
</p>
<p>a new recruit to the staff of spies produced evidence to the con-
</p>
<p>trary.*'^
</p>
<p>At any rate, Clark's investigations for several months after the
</p>
<p>fire do not seem to have yielded any information on the origins of
</p>
<p>the holocaust. Then, in January, 1851, he was put in touch with
</p>
<p>Henry Phelps, hired him as a secret agent for the railroad, and in
</p>
<p>the next two months was supplied with enough evidence to link
</p>
<p>Fitch and his friends with the burning of the depot in Detroit.
</p>
<p>Phelps was a man of high intelligence, clever to the point of
</p>
<p>cunning, who was reduced to living by his wits. He had come to
</p>
<p>Michigan from New York in 1836 at the age of twenty-two with his
</p>
<p>family. He worked on the family farm in Oakland County near
</p>
<p>Detroit and then in his brother's distillery. He struck out on his
</p>
<p>own in 1840 when he went to Michigan Centre and rented a dis-
</p>
<p>tillery. This venture failed after six months when a draft he had
</p>
<p>offered to cover the rent proved to be worthless. A second attempt
</p>
<p>to go into business nearer home also failed. He then moved to
</p>
<p>Sharon, west of Ann Arbor, took up farming, and to supplement
</p>
<p>his income, pettifogged in the local justice courts. He also dabbled
</p>
<p>in politics, served as town clerk, and won a commission as captain
</p>
<p>of dragoons in the state militia. This budding career was nipped in
</p>
<p>1844 when he was tried for horse-stealing and sentenced to five
</p>
<p>years in the state prison in Jackson. Pardoned in April, 1849, six
</p>
<p>months before his term expired, he returned to his farm, and after
</p>
<p>a profitless year or more, went to work in December, 1850 as a stool
</p>
<p>pigeon for the United States District Attorney for Michigan,
</p>
<p>George C. Bates. Phelps' task, at $1.25 per day plus expenses, was
</p>
<p>to bring to book the numerous counterfeiters who plagued this
</p>
<p>wild west of the 1850's with their bogus coin. His good working
</p>
<p>knowledge of the law from both sides of the fence, combined with
</p>
<p>an unscrupulous boldness in digging up evidence, soon won him
</p>
<p>the confidence of his employer.
</p>
<p>Not long after he had begun to work for Bates, Phelps reported
</p>
<p>that he had established contact with the leader of a big counter-
</p>
<p>feiting ring in Jackson County, Abel F. Fitch of Michigan Centre.

</p>
<p>He further revealed that in the course of his association with Fitch,
</p>
<p>he had learned of the latter's connection with the burning of the
</p>
<p>freight depot in Detroit. Bates undoubtedly relayed this infor-
</p>
<p>mation to the railroad officials, and Phelps' promotion to Clark's
</p>
<p>[42]
</p>
<p>corps of secret agents with a salary of forty dollars a month fol-
</p>
<p>lowed almost immediately.
</p>
<p>In his new capacity, Phelps went to the Centre to follow up the
</p>
<p>lead he had uncovered as a federal informer. He spent as much
</p>
<p>time as he could at Filley's tavern renewing acquaintances and
</p>
<p>worming his way into the confidence of its patrons. He made a
</p>
<p>special effort to be with Fitch and talk to him, pretending that he
</p>
<p>wished to buy his prize twin oxen, and dogging his footsteps at
</p>
<p>Michigan Centre as well as in Lansing and Detroit. In a short time,
</p>
<p>Phelps was able to report to Clark that he knew who had burned
</p>
<p>the freight depot. It was an old friend of his, George Washington
</p>
<p>Gay, of Detroit, once known as the "Whig Bully of City Hall,"
</p>
<p>possessor of a long police record, and now the proprietor of a
</p>
<p>brothel in the lower city. Gay had admitted to him, Phelps, that
</p>
<p>he had set fire to the depot and that he had been hired by Fitch and
</p>
<p>his friends to do it. The latter had also furnished Gay with the
</p>
<p>"match" that ignited the building. This match was an ingenious
</p>
<p>machine, a cylindrical block of wood with holes bored lengthwise
</p>
<p>and transversely and filled with cotton and camphene (a turpen-
</p>
<p>tine derivative then used as an illuminant), which would bum
</p>
<p>slowly for several hours and then flare up into a blaze. Gay had ad-
</p>
<p>mitted that he had received the match from someone at Michigan
</p>
<p>Centre, ignited it and secretly placed it in the cupola of the freight
</p>
<p>house about eight o'clock on the evening of November 18. The
</p>
<p>match had flared up about two o'clock the morning of the nine-
</p>
<p>teenth and the resulting fire had destroyed the building and its
</p>
<p>contents. For his work. Gay said he had received $150, which sum
</p>
<p>had been made up by Fitch, Filley, Corwin, Williams, and others
</p>
<p>at the Centre. The latter, according to Phelps, had also admitted
</p>
<p>to him their participation in the crime substantially as related by
</p>
<p>Gay and had even boasted of how much each had contributed to
</p>
<p>the purse of arson.
</p>
<p>If Clark and his legal adviser. Van Arman, were amazed at these
</p>
<p>revelations, Phelps was prepared to prove them fully. He invited
</p>
<p>his employers to visit Gay's brothel and see and hear for them-

</p>
<p>selves. Accordingly, early in April, 1851, the two visited Gay several
</p>
<p>times in Phelps' company, disguising themselves in rough dress and
</p>
<p>posing as fellow criminals. To win Gay's confidence, they boasted
</p>
<p>of their past exploits, flashed counterfeit bills, and said diey were
</p>
<p>[43]
</p>
<p>interested in working out a scheme to free Old Sile Doty, the
</p>
<p>famous criminal, who was then serving a long sentence in the Hills-
</p>
<p>dale jail. In the course of the conversation, Gay freely admitted
</p>
<p>that he had burned the depot in November and told just how much
</p>
<p>he had been paid and who had paid him. Gay also allowed his two
</p>
<p>new friends to see the match he had in an upstairs room, similar
</p>
<p>to the one he had used in the old depot and which he was going to
</p>
<p>use to burn the new one which had been built on the same site. He
</p>
<p>assured them that he could make more money by burning depots
</p>
<p>on the railroad than any other way and could get $50 more from
</p>
<p>Fitch and his friends for burning the new depot than he had re-
</p>
<p>ceived for the old one. After agreeing upon some future criminal
</p>
<p>ventures, Clark and Van Arman left with Phelps, fully satisfied
</p>
<p>that their agent was telling the truth and had given them the
</p>
<p>means to break up the conspiracy at the Centre.
</p>
<p>Phelps clinched the case against Fitch and company when he
</p>
<p>informed Clark that they planned to burn the depot at Niles and
</p>
<p>had asked him, Phelps, to do it. They had offered to supply him
</p>
<p>with a match and pay him $200 for the job. When he had balked
</p>
<p>at the risks involved, they had assured him that the match had
</p>
<p>worked perfectly in Detroit, and that if he were caught, they could
</p>
<p>easily swear him clear. Phelps then, with the full knowledge of his
</p>
<p>railroad superiors, agreed after some delay to carry out the task,
</p>
<p>and set the time. Clark arranged for another agent to be at Filley's
</p>
<p>tavern on the appointed night when Phelps was to be "fixed out"
</p>
<p>for the trip to Niles.
</p>
<p>The night of April 11, 1851, Phelps went to the tavern at the
</p>
<p>Centre. He had with him Heman Lake, a contemporary inmate
</p>
<p>of the state prison, whom he had persuaded Clark to hire as his
</p>
<p>assistant and who had fully corroborated all of his reports. After
</p>
<p>some general talk. Bill Corwin went to a small room in the tavern,
</p>
<p>unlocked it, and brought out a box with the match in it, and then
</p>
<p>carried it outside to Phelps' waiting buggy. Falkner, the railroad
</p>
<p>agent who was present all the time, and had been told to watch
</p>
<p>for the delivery of a box to Phelps, confirmed all that the latter

</p>
<p>reported. He had heard only snatches of the conversation between
</p>
<p>Phelps and Fitch and the others, but had seen Corwin take the box
</p>
<p>out and put it in the buggy.
</p>
<p>Leaving the tavern, Phelps and Lake drove to Grass Lake where
</p>
<p>[44]
</p>
<p>they showed the box and the match to Clark and then started off
</p>
<p>for Niles. There, Phelps placed the ignited match in the depot,
</p>
<p>and the railroad men, fully aware of the plot, hastened to extin-
</p>
<p>guish it before any harm was done.
</p>
<p>Clark was now ready to act. Phelps had proved to his satisfaction
</p>
<p>that Gay had burned the Detroit depot, that Fitch and others had
</p>
<p>hired Gay to burn the depot, and that he, Phelps himself, had
</p>
<p>been hired to burn the Niles depot in a similar manner. Back in
</p>
<p>February, Clark had reported to Brooks that "the burning of the
</p>
<p>building [would] be proven beyond a doubt." He was now more
</p>
<p>than ever certain of his ground. And when he had seen Fitch in
</p>
<p>March lobbying in Lansing, he could not help gloating: "I think
</p>
<p>[Fitch] had better save his strength as he has a good deal of labor
</p>
<p>to do for the state within the next five or ten years without going
</p>
<p>so far from home. If this does not prove so I am no prophet." Once
</p>
<p>the Niles trap had been sprung and all the accumulated evidence
</p>
<p>carefully prepared, Clark was ready to move and make the arrests.^^

<p>JDY APRIL 19, 1851, four months to the day after the depot fire,
</p>
<p>all the arrangements for the roundup of the railroad's enemies were
</p>
<p>completed. A warrant was issued on the complaint of Phelps for
</p>
<p>the arrest of forty-four men, charging them with the burning of the
</p>
<p>depot as part of a general conspiracy to destroy the property of
</p>
<p>the Michigan Central Railroad and with a number of other crimes.
</p>
<p>The list of accused included Fitch, Burnett, Filley, and almost
</p>
<p>two score of their friends, anybody in Michigan Centre or Jackson,
</p>
<p>apparently, who had ever expressed any hostility to the railroad.
</p>
<p>Also named in the warrant were George W. Gay and his Detroit
</p>
<p>accomplice, Erastus Smith, as well as a number of known counter-
</p>
<p>feiters whose inclusion lent substance to the allegations of general
</p>
<p>villainy. On the afternoon of April 19, one special train started
</p>
<p>from Niles for Jackson with the sheriff of Berrien County and his
</p>
<p>deputies aboard, while another left from Detroit and headed west-
</p>
<p>ward carrying the sheriff of Wayne County and about a hundred
</p>
<p>deputized railroad hands. As the trains passed through the dis-
</p>
<p>affected areas a little after midnight, squads of three or four officers
</p>
<p>were dispatched at intervals, each to get its man. The two trains
</p>
<p>met near Jackson and waited for the haul. The Wayne County
</p>
<p>sheriff accompanied by Clark and Van Arman brought in the prize
</p>
<p>prisoner. Fitch himself. In three hours more than thirty others
</p>
<p>were routed out of bed and brought aboard. Day had already
</p>
<p>broken when the trains started on the slow journey back to Detroit
</p>
<p>with the triumphant posse and its bewildered prey.^^
</p>
<p>Late Saturday afternoon, the prisoners were marched from the
</p>
<p>cars through the city streets to the jail in a long column of twos,
</p>
<p>each man guarded by a deputy. Fitch, at the head of the column,
</p>
<p>was struck by the wry humor of the scene.
</p>
<p>I being a captain [in the militia] they placed me in front, of course,
</p>
<p>and we made quite an imposing appearance giving the Detroit folks a
</p>
<p>good opportunity to take a fair view of us. It looks like a Connecticut
</p>
<p>general training and must have been great satisfaction to the RR folks.
</p>
<p>In jail, the small mob joined Gay and Smith, who had been ar-

<p>[49]
</p>
<p>rested in the city that morning. Burnett, who had not been at home
</p>
<p>when the posse called, hearing that there was a warrant out for
</p>
<p>his arrest, took a train to Detroit and gave himself up to join his
</p>
<p>friends in jail. In the course of the next week, additional prisoners
</p>
<p>were brought in from Jackson, Niles, and elsewhere.^*^
</p>
<p>The law began to move with illegal haste. None of the prisoners
</p>
<p>was brought for examination before the police justice who had
</p>
<p>issued the warrant, as required by law. After they were in jail, the
</p>
<p>grand jury was hurriedly convened, without the required six days
</p>
<p>notice, and returned five joint bills of indictment against the ac-
</p>
<p>cused. The first indictment, under which they were later tried,
</p>
<p>charged them all with burning the depot and specified that Gay
</p>
<p>had actually set the fire and had been hired by the others to com-
</p>
<p>mit the crime. The railroad's officials, at the same time, brought
</p>
<p>civil suit against the prisoners for $150,000 damages and had them
</p>
<p>held in $50,000 bail each. In time, they were also indicted in
</p>
<p>Berrien and Calhoun counties for conspiring to burn the depots
</p>
<p>in Niles and Marshall, and finally, by a Federal grand jury for
</p>
<p>counterfeiting and for burning the United States mails.^^
</p>
<p>Staggering under this massed legal assault, the prisoners were
</p>
<p>arraigned before Judge Benjamin F. H. Witherell in Wayne
</p>
<p>County Court on April 29. They pleaded not guilty to all the in-
</p>
<p>dictments. The prosecution announced that it was ready to go to
</p>
<p>trial on the first indictment and wished to do so quickly. Counsel
</p>
<p>for the defense, after vain attempts to have the indictments quashed
</p>
<p>and a mistrial called on technical grounds, held out for a month's
</p>
<p>delay. When the court refused to grant this motion, the defendants
</p>
<p>took advantage of their legal option and elected to be tried in the
</p>
<p>circuit court, which would not sit for two weeks.^2
</p>
<p>Primarily, the defendants desperately sought delay to slow down
</p>
<p>the judicial mills which were surely grinding them to their doom
</p>
<p>in jail. Their counsel, neither able nor distinguished, needed time
</p>
<p>to prepare the case, seek out witnesses, study the evidence, and
</p>
<p>work out the defense. Representing the accused in court that day
</p>
<p>were Nehemiah H. Joy of Jackson, and Henry Frink, but lately

<p>removed to Chicago from Jackson, two village lawyers who had
</p>
<p>come forward to help their friends in need. They were aided by
</p>
<p>Henry H. Wells and William A. Cook, two Detroit lawyers of no
</p>
<p>great reputation at the bar. Another obscure Detroit lawyer, L. H.
</p>
<p>[50]
</p>
<p>Hewitt, appeared for Gay and Smith. Opposing them was a battery
</p>
<p>of the city's legal lights who had been retained by the Michigan
</p>
<p>Central to assist David Stuart, the county prosecuting attorney.
</p>
<p>On behalf of the people, Stuart was joined by James F. Joy and
</p>
<p>John Van Arman and such outstanding members of the Detroit
</p>
<p>bar as James A. Van Dyke, Jacob M. Howard, Alexander D. Frazer,
</p>
<p>Daniel Goodwin, and William Gray. Other law)'ers of reputation
</p>
<p>were, moreover, interdicted by the hostility of public opinion from
</p>
<p>taking the case of the "conspirators"; only one of them, William
</p>
<p>A. Howard, showed his independence and volunteered his services
</p>
<p>to the defendants, justifying his action by explaining that "there
</p>
<p>was more real danger to the community from allowing a heartless
</p>
<p>monied corporation to crush at their will any number of men in
</p>
<p>the manner pursued than by any depredations of the prisoners."
</p>
<p>For his act, Howard was charged with treason to law and order and
</p>
<p>the welfare of the people among whom he lived. His gesture was
</p>
<p>more spirited than effective, for he was noted as a good business
</p>
<p>counsellor rather than as a trial lawyer.^^
</p>
<p>The case was called up for trial on May 14 before Judge Warner
</p>
<p>Wing in the Wayne County Circuit Court. The defense continued
</p>
<p>to spar desperately for time, fearful of the massed power of the
</p>
<p>state and its wealthiest corporation. Fitch, undoubtedly the main-
</p>
<p>spring of defense strategy, vowed he would not be forced to trial
</p>
<p>until he was fully prepared. First, his lawyers filed a motion for
</p>
<p>separate trials for him and four other defendants, a stratagem of
</p>
<p>delay and obstruction. Then, on behalf of Fitch alone, a motion
</p>
<p>was made for a change of venue to a neighboring county on the
</p>
<p>ground that the public had been so prejudiced against the defend-
</p>
<p>ants that a fair trial in Detroit was impossible. In support, counsel
</p>
<p>submitted affidavits containing extracts from the three Detroit
</p>
<p>daily newspapers. Judge Wing denied this motion on the technical
</p>
<p>giound that if Fitch were tried in another county under this indict-
</p>
<p>ment, the rest of the defendants could never be tried, as there was
</p>
<p>no provision for the return of the indictment to Wayne County.
</p>
<p>The next day, the defense filed a new motion for a continuance to

<p>the November term of court so that three absent witnesses could
</p>
<p>be procured. When the prosecution showed that this request was
</p>
<p>unreasonable and factitious, the judge denied it, but relented
</p>
<p>enough to grant an adjournment until May 28.^^

<p>Meanwhile, the case was being tried in the court of public opin-
</p>
<p>ion, to the great detriment of the accused. From the moment of
</p>
<p>the triumphal procession through the streets and the first press re-
</p>
<p>ports of the mass arrests, great excitement gripped the city. One of
</p>
<p>Fitch's close friends barely escaped a drubbing in a public bar
</p>
<p>when he defended the prisoners against vicious abuse. The news-
</p>
<p>papers played on the fears of the people. They accepted the charges
</p>
<p>as true and proven and added a few of their own. In reporting the
</p>
<p>arrests, they alluded to the "gang of desperadoes" and hinted
</p>
<p>darkly at the existence of a diabolical criminal organization op-
</p>
<p>erating in several states and possessed of an infernal machine for
</p>
<p>blowing up trains. The Advertiser added blackmail to the official
</p>
<p>charges and referred to Jackson County as the home of drunks,
</p>
<p>counterfeiters, and other criminals. The Free Press maintained a
</p>
<p>correct attitude for more than a month, but then attacked the de-
</p>
<p>fendants as an "organized band of desperadoes congregated
</p>
<p>around a drunken rum-hole in Jackson County." When the in-
</p>
<p>dictments were issued, the Tribune called for suspended judgment
</p>
<p>and went on to print a story, probably supplied by one of the rail-
</p>
<p>road's spies, of a secret meeting of the "gang of ruffians" to auction
</p>
<p>off Wescott's life to the highest bidder all of which proved "the
</p>
<p>depths to which [the accused] were ready to sink themselves in
</p>
<p>crime and depravity." Assuring its readers that the prisoners could
</p>
<p>expect full justice in Wayne County and that it would not even
</p>
<p>publish the indictment lest it create prejudice, the Daily Tribune
</p>
<p>pilloried the defendants as "a lawless gang of monsters in human
</p>
<p>shape" and called on Mayor Zachariah Chandler to provide the
</p>
<p>city with additional police protection against the dangers threat-
</p>
<p>ened by those of the criminals still at large. It gave prominence to
</p>
<p>reports of fires in different parts of the city and cautioned the police
</p>
<p>to be on the alert against the incendiaries. Finally, it revealed for
</p>
<p>the benefit of the public, which it counseled to withhold judg-
</p>
<p>ment, that the accused had a long history of criminal activity and
</p>
<p>that Fitch in particular had long meditated lawless vengeance
</p>
<p>against the railroad."^

<p>Other newspapers in the state and elsewhere, took up the hue
</p>
<p>and cry and descanted with horror on what they regarded "as
</p>
<p>evidence of the universal demoralization in Michigan; and de-
</p>
<p>manded immediate punishment of the accused" as well as the
</p>
<p>[52 ]
</p>
<p>restoration of capital punishment in the state. The press alarm
</p>
<p>moved one terror-stricken Presbyterian clergyman in New York
</p>
<p>City to claim that he and other passengers had had their drinking
</p>
<p>water poisoned while traveling through the state on the Michigan
</p>
<p>Central Railroad.^^
</p>
<p>Fitch protested this campaign of calumny to one of the Free Press
</p>
<p>reporters who visited him in jail but apparently to no effect. "Such
</p>
<p>false and wicked statements," he wrote his wife, "as was published
</p>
<p>in the newspapers is enough to craze anyone." Burnett struck back
</p>
<p>in a long letter to the Ypsilanti Sentinel, which the editor printed
</p>
<p>with the explanation that "as a portion of the press has been very
</p>
<p>free, to say the least, in pronouncing judgment in the case," com-
</p>
<p>mon justice dictated that the other side be given a hearing. Writing
</p>
<p>from jail, Burnett gave his story of the highhanded proceedings
</p>
<p>and protested against the "unwarrantable statements [that] have
</p>
<p>been made . . . concerning us, contrary to the just rights of free-
</p>
<p>men." The Jackson American Citizen reprinted Burnett's letter
</p>
<p>and editorially commented on the extravagant tone of the Detroit
</p>
<p>and eastern neAvspapers, whose published disclosures it felt, "have
</p>
<p>proved too much for the gullibility of any acquainted with the
</p>
<p>matter." ^^
</p>
<p>In time, the excitement died down as the press showed proper
</p>
<p>restraint in reporting the trial. But irreparable harm had been
</p>
<p>done the cause of the defendants. They had been branded as
</p>
<p>criminals who had wished to destroy "our young and beauteous
</p>
<p>city" and the presumption of their guilt had been fixed in the
</p>
<p>minds of the citizens. The effects of the public hysteria had been
</p>
<p>compounded when the city fathers, responding to the fearful agita-
</p>
<p>tion, had called out a large night watch to protect the city from
</p>
<p>destruction by fire and assigned additional guards to each business
</p>
<p>block. Echoes of the civic "great fear" had resounded in Federal
</p>
<p>Judge Ross Wilkins' charge to the grand jury of the United States
</p>
<p>District Court: the judge, in presenting the case against the alleged
</p>
<p>counterfeiters including Fitch, Filley, and six of their friends,
</p>
<p>pointedly referred to that "malignant spirit" and "depravity of

<p>heart" of these enemies of society. The officials of the Michigan
</p>
<p>Central, taking advantage of the excitement and adding to it in
</p>
<p>their own way, put a twenty-four hour guard in and around the
</p>
<p>county jail at their own expense. Fitch thought they did this merely
</p>
<p>[53]
</p>
<p>"to make a great display." This action seemed to him, besides, a
</p>
<p>vicious and unfair form of harassment. He protested.
</p>
<p>And now how in the name of common sense can we ever prepare for
</p>
<p>trial that is a fair and impartial one when all such we say or do is carried
</p>
<p>to our enimies and they allowed to use it as they please, besides it seems
</p>
<p>to me an unheard of procedure that a party complainant should have
</p>
<p>persons arrested at their instigation and then treat them in such an in-
</p>
<p>solent manner as they do us.
</p>
<p>When court convened again on May 28, William A. Howard
</p>
<p>announced that he had been east and had retained Senator
</p>
<p>William H. Seward of New York for the defense. He himself and
</p>
<p>Cook, Howard explained, had been ill and unable to take hold of
</p>
<p>the case properly. Howard did not, however, touch on the decisive
</p>
<p>reason for procuring more eminent counsel. Undoubtedly, it was
</p>
<p>Fitch's determination to get the very best lawyers to defend himself
</p>
<p>and his friends and oppose the legal array of the prosecution. He
</p>
<p>had been depressed by the way things had been going for the
</p>
<p>defendants, reviled everywhere, stymied in court again and again,
</p>
<p>and confined in jail without bail. And while he believed Frink and
</p>
<p>the others were doing the best they could, he strongly felt, as he
</p>
<p>wrote his wife, that 'Sve have a hard enimy to fight" and need "to
</p>
<p>get good counsel." It was not strange that in his plight he should
</p>
<p>turn to Seward for succor. The senator had but recently uttered
</p>
<p>his "higher law" sentiments and become the idol of the antislavery
</p>
<p>people everywhere. The repute of his efforts as a criminal lawyer
</p>
<p>on behalf of the lowly could not have been lost on the astute Fitch,
</p>
<p>Seward, appealed to in the name of the common man against a
</p>
<p>powerful corporation which had bought up the best legal talent in
</p>
<p>the state, and offered on Fitch's behalf a fee of $2,000, agreed to
</p>
<p>come west and take the case. Attempts by influential eastern friends
</p>
<p>of the railroad to dissuade him failed, for he believed that as an
</p>
<p>American lawyer, he had to assist those who most needed assistance.
</p>
<p>When word came to Fitch that Sew^ard had agreed to come to
</p>
<p>Detroit and take the case, his spirits rose greatly. He assured his
</p>
<p>wife, and himself, "He is a big gun no mistake." ^^

</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Sew^ard could not arrange his affairs to arrive in
</p>
<p>Detroit until June 5. Would the court, pleaded Howard, postpone
</p>
<p>the case until then, particularly since the defendants now withdrew
</p>
<p>their requests for separate trials. Judge Wing refused to grant the
</p>
<p>[54]
</p>
<p>postponement without good legal reason. Opposing counsel, how-
</p>
<p>ever, finally did agree to a compromise, whereby the defendants
</p>
<p>would be tried jointly, a jury would be empaneled, two or three
</p>
<p>witnesses examined on a specific point, and then the case allowed
</p>
<p>to rest until Seward's arrival.
</p>
<p>The trial got under way the next day, May 29. The number of
</p>
<p>defendants had been reduced to thirty-seven; some had been dis-
</p>
<p>charged for lack of evidence, some not arrested for the same reason,
</p>
<p>and one had died in jail. The deceased was none other than Gay,
</p>
<p>who was charged with burning the depot at the behest of the
</p>
<p>others. He had died on May 8 of what Fitch described as a "loath-
</p>
<p>some and disgusting" disease. When the ofl&cials accused one of the
</p>
<p>prisoners, who was a doctor by profession, of poisoning Gay, a
</p>
<p>charge soon dispelled by a post-mortem. Fitch winced as though
</p>
<p>lashed.60
</p>
<p>First, a jury was chosen in short order. The twelve men, selected
</p>
<p>from a panel of names taken from the tax assessment rolls of the
</p>
<p>city, were representative of the substantial and respectable portion
</p>
<p>of the community. They included such outstanding political and
</p>
<p>business figures as Levi Cook, Horace Hallock, Alexander C. Mc-
</p>
<p>Graw, Buckminster Wight, and Silas A. Bagg. The others on the
</p>
<p>jury were relatively unknown, but most had served as minor mu-
</p>
<p>nicipal functionaries. Fitch thought it was a "good jury" and did
</p>
<p>not consider the possibility that it might be swayed by the civic
</p>
<p>interests so closely bound up with those of the city's great com-
</p>
<p>mercial outlet, the Michigan Central Railroad.^i
</p>
<p>Van Arman then opened the case for the prosecution. He said
</p>
<p>the state would prove that Gay had burned the depot and that the
</p>
<p>defendants had paid him $150 to do it and furnished the "match."
</p>
<p>Henry Phelps was the first witness called and told how Gay had
</p>
<p>confessed his crime to him and incriminated the men from Mich-
</p>
<p>igan Centre. Darius Clark and Van Arman then took the stand in
</p>
<p>turn and told of their visits to Gay's house, where the latter had
</p>
<p>repeated his confessions, thus substantiating Phelps' testimony in
</p>
<p>this respect. After hearing these witnesses, the court adjourned, as

</p>
<p>agreed, for one week until June 5.
</p>
<p>All this while, the defendants were languishing in the crowded
</p>
<p>Wayne County jail, spied on by the railroad guards, prevented
</p>
<p>from taking any effective action in their own defense, fearful and
</p>
<p>[55]
</p>
<p>hopeful by turns of the outcome. Fitch, in particular, was subject
</p>
<p>to these emotional fluctuations, as may be clearly seen in a series
</p>
<p>of letters he wrote his wife, Amanda, from jail. His first reaction
</p>
<p>to arrest and imprisonment was one of incredulity and indignation
</p>
<p>buoyed by hope. The day after his arrival in jail, he wrote, almost
</p>
<p>lightly, "This is the first time I ever addressed you from such a
</p>
<p>place and I hope to God it will be the last." The next day, he was
</p>
<p>somewhat chagrined at having to write from the same place, but
</p>
<p>repeatedly asserted his innocence and assured his wife: "We know
</p>
<p>that the truth is mighty and believe will prevale, RR influence
</p>
<p>and money to the contrary notwithstanding . . . We shall all of us
</p>
<p>be delivered in due time unharmed from the hands of our enimies,
</p>
<p>false swearing bribery and corruption to the contrary notwith-
</p>
<p>standing." He and his fellow prisoners felt "injured and abused,
</p>
<p>insulted and wronged" but were quite sure that all would end well.
</p>
<p>"I feel to (sic) indignant to feel meloncholly," he concluded his
</p>
<p>second letter from jail, "I shall be home before long." All the same,
</p>
<p>he was bewildered by the vindictiveness of the railroad officials,
</p>
<p>though he was inclined to think that they were deceived by
</p>
<p>Phelps, Wescott, and the other spies, "who gather round them for
</p>
<p>the purpose of getting their money and they care not how." He
</p>
<p>vented his spleen against these spies, accusing them of concocting
</p>
<p>a monstrous plot. "When they found they could not draw me by
</p>
<p>any pretext what ever in to any of their scheems," he explained,
</p>
<p>"they finally pitched upon this depot scheem made by themselves
</p>
<p>so far as I am concerned out of whole clothe and now seek to con-
</p>
<p>vict me and others." But, he was sure, they "will be worse con-
</p>
<p>founded than those who undertook to build the tower of babel,"
</p>
<p>and called "Divine vengeance" down upon them.^^
</p>
<p>After two weeks of uninterrupted confinement, of writhing un-
</p>
<p>der the lash of public condemnation, the note of defiant hope be-
</p>
<p>gan to fade. Fitch now found his quarters "very uncomfortable"
</p>
<p>and began to worry about his health and what would happen to
</p>
<p>him if he came down with his old stomach ailment. He was soon
</p>
<p>writing, "It does not seem as though I could stand it here much

</p>
<p>longer." Gloomily expecting the worst, he told Amanda that he
</p>
<p>would send for her if he had an attack, as he did not think he could
</p>
<p>live through one without her "kind attention." He had been so
</p>
<p>much troubled with "Dispepshi," he was afraid he could not sur-
</p>
<p>[56]
</p>
<p>vive long with the best of care, and after a month in jail, concluded
</p>
<p>hopelessly that "no man can long enjoy health in this uncomfi table
</p>
<p>place." ^3
</p>
<p>Gloom deepened into despair as he felt the full force of legal
</p>
<p>pressure and hatred. Only occasional flashes of desperate hope lit-
</p>
<p>up the murk of his cell and then were followed by a sense of
</p>
<p>martyrdom. On May ii, he reflected sadly, "I have always been
</p>
<p>taught that money is power but I never felt it so sensibly as I do
</p>
<p>now." Three days later, he cried out to Amanda,
</p>
<p>I am still in jail and how long I am to be kept here I know not, but if
</p>
<p>nothing but the pound of flesh nearest my heart will satisfy my enimies
</p>
<p>and they seem to be determined not to be satisfied with anything less,
</p>
<p>I dont know but with their power and influence they will compell me
</p>
<p>to yeald it to them ... I fear that many of us will be obliged to sacrifice
</p>
<p>our lives to appease the wrath of this soulless corporation.
</p>
<p>In another two weeks. Fitch was prepared for martyrdom. He could
</p>
<p>not understand how innocence could be so wronged, but "if they
</p>
<p>can with all their cunning devise such damnable scheems and carry
</p>
<p>them through and convict us, why it is time that their power was
</p>
<p>known and guarded against, for no mans liberty is safe." And then,
</p>
<p>in a sentimental vision, he returned to his dear Amanda, his com-
</p>
<p>panion of twenty years.
</p>
<p>This is a fine May morning and although my boddy is surrounded by
</p>
<p>bars and bolts yet my spirit, thank God, is left free to roam and hold
</p>
<p>sweet communion with those I hold near and dear here on earth, and
</p>
<p>were I permitted to be with you and sis in person as heretofore to take
</p>
<p>strawberry walks and roam over fields and landscape, as we were wont
</p>
<p>to do at this delightful season, what untold pleasures might we not injoy.
</p>
<p>But this may be ordered for some wise purpose, for God in his providence
</p>
<p>does all things well, we should not know how to appreciate and injoy
</p>
<p>happiness did we not occasionally taste of misery.**
</p>
<p>Above all. Fitch fumed because he and his friends could not get
</p>
<p>free on bail. Efforts to do so ran up against the negligence of court
</p>
<p>officials and the huge sums set at the behest of railroad counsel.
</p>
<p>The good citizens of Detroit and perhaps even the railroad officials

</p>
<p>really feared to let the criminals described by their newspapers
</p>
<p>loose in their midst. Fitch raged helplessly as week passed week in
</p>
<p>crippling confinement. He wanted to go home and organize his
</p>
<p>defense. He knew he could raise any reasonable amount of bail.
</p>
<p>Indignant and bewildered, he could not understand why the rail-
</p>
<p>[57 ]
</p>
<p>road showed such a "fiendish disposition" toward him and accused
</p>
<p>the authorities of lacking one spark of humanity and trampHng
</p>
<p>"on all laws, constitutions and justice." He was soon convinced
</p>
<p>that they fully intended to keep him from preparing adequately
</p>
<p>for the trial, "that our enimies would be glad to keep us here untill
</p>
<p>our enigies were all impaired or weakened so that we would fall
</p>
<p>an easy prey." Finally, as June 5 and Seward's arrival neared, and
</p>
<p>Judge Wing announced he would set bail for the criminal pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings. Fitch took heart. He asked Amanda to tell his friends to
</p>
<p>come to Detroit to stand bail for him. He explained somewhat
</p>
<p>optimistically that "they feel ashamed to think that they have acted
</p>
<p>so heretofore" and openly expressed his fears, now happily dis-
</p>
<p>sipated, that if he had had to be in court days and in jail nights,
</p>
<p>it would have killed him. He was sure his bail would not be set
</p>
<p>very high because public opinion had changed in his favor. He
</p>
<p>noted that King Strang's Mormons had been arrested for treason
</p>
<p>and that their bail had been set at only $2,000 each. His own bail
</p>
<p>would, of course, be higher, "so you see that treason against the
</p>
<p>RR is a much greater crime than treason against the government."
</p>
<p>But, he was certain, "the day of retributive justice is at hand. This
</p>
<p>company will yet learn that they cannot trample upon the dearest
</p>
<p>rights of Freemen without bringing down on their heads retribu-
</p>
<p>tive justice." ^^
</p>
<p>Fitch was wrong. On the resumption of the trial on June 5,
</p>
<p>with Seward leading the defense, he soon found out how wrong
</p>
<p>he was. Without delay, Frink requested that bail be set for Fitch
</p>
<p>and Burnett. Prosecuting Attorney Stuart demanded that the
</p>
<p>amount of bail be fixed at $15,000 for the indictment being tried
</p>
<p>and half as much in each of the four other indictments, a total of
</p>
<p>$45,000 for each defendant. Frink's objections that these amounts
</p>
<p>were excessive were brushed aside. The presecution dwelt on the
</p>
<p>enormity of the offenses charged and threw up to the defendants
</p>
<p>their boasts that they could give bail in the sum of $100,000, if
</p>
<p>necessary. Here, Seward, speaking for the first time, said that al-
</p>
<p>though he knew little of the merits of the case, he considered the

</p>
<p>amounts requested excessive, and vehemently declared that if he
</p>
<p>were the defendants, "he would rot in jail . . . before he would
</p>
<p>submit to such persecution and oppression." Counsel for the state
</p>
<p>then explained with amazing frankness that bail was deliberately
</p>
<p>[58]
</p>
<p>set high to prevent the prisoners from being bailed at all, for if
</p>
<p>one of them absconded, the whole trial would be halted and all
</p>
<p>proceedings would be voided. The railroad officials, it seems, had
</p>
<p>at last got their hands on their enemies and were not going to re-
</p>
<p>lease them even for a moment on a legal nicety until they had all
</p>
<p>been duly disposed of. As Stuart declared, "There were insuperable
</p>
<p>objections to allowing bail" at all, for the prisoners were liable
</p>
<p>to be arrested under the other indictments and taken to another
</p>
<p>county to be tried. Seward in turn insisted on the constitutional
</p>
<p>rights of his clients: "This was a court of justice and . . . these de-
</p>
<p>fendants were prisoners at the bar and . . . the constitution of the
</p>
<p>country was not a fiction ..." The prisoners were entitled to rea-
</p>
<p>sonable bail and $45,000 for each of thirty-seven defendants, or a
</p>
<p>total of nearly two million dollars, was plainly exorbitant. After
</p>
<p>further argument, during which Seward called the attention of the
</p>
<p>court to the higher law, "a proper sense of its obligations to God
</p>
<p>and humanity, and love of liberty for the oppressed under all cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances," Judge Wing announced his compromise figure
</p>
<p>$20,000 for Fitch and $10,000 for Burnett. The sureties for each,
</p>
<p>friends and neighbors from Jackson County, then stepped forward
</p>
<p>and answered as to their ability to stand bail.
</p>
<p>The prisoners were not however to be released. Stuart reminded
</p>
<p>the court that they were also being held in $50,000 bail in the civil
</p>
<p>suit of the company against them for damages. The defense tried
</p>
<p>to have the capias by which they were held in the civil suit quashed
</p>
<p>in open court, but to no avail. And except for brief interludes for
</p>
<p>selected defendants, the prisoners were to remain in jail during the
</p>
<p>whole length of the trial, "held fast," as Seward later put it, "as
</p>
<p>in a cage of iron." ^e
</p>
<p>With the matter of bail disposed of, the trial really got under
</p>
<p>way. For three months, through the blazing heat of a midwest sum-
</p>
<p>mer, the court heard the testimony of nearly five hundred wit-
</p>
<p>nesses. Judge Wing's minutes of the evidence covered five hundred
</p>
<p>ten closely written pages of legal foolscap and the printed report
</p>
<p>of the testimony fills more than five hundred fifty octavo pages in

</p>
<p>small type. It had been expected that the trial would be over in a
</p>
<p>few days, but by the end of June, all were resigned to a long-drawn
</p>
<p>battle. When one of the witnesses was asked if he knew when the
</p>
<p>case had begun. Judge Wing sardonically interjected, "Can you
</p>
<p>[59]
</p>
<p>tell when it will end?" and laughter greeted the sally. By the mid-
</p>
<p>dle of July, there were demands for longer sessions. The prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion suggested evening sessions and the jury asked that proceedings
</p>
<p>begin an hour earlier in the morning. The judge did nothing, but
</p>
<p>declared the matter was a serious one and impressed counsel with
</p>
<p>the necessity "of urging this trial through to an ending."
</p>
<p>It was not until September 2 that the parade of witnesses came
</p>
<p>to a halt. Each side had taken more than a month to present its
</p>
<p>case, and the prosecution then had called additional witnesses in
</p>
<p>rebuttal. Of the elapsed time, however, only some forty-seven days
</p>
<p>had been used in the actual taking of testimony. At least one month
</p>
<p>had been wasted when one or another of the defendants and
</p>
<p>jurors was stricken by disease in that stifling summer heat and
</p>
<p>could not make an appearance in court. At first, opposing counsel
</p>
<p>had agreed to let the proceedings continue without prejudice to
</p>
<p>either side. But by the end of July, the defense lawyers, stung by
</p>
<p>repeated adverse decisions of the court, stubbornly refused to enter
</p>
<p>into any further stipulations to waive their clients' rights. Court
</p>
<p>had therefore to adjourn from day to day until the absent defend-
</p>
<p>ant or juror was able to return. Almost two weeks were thus lost
</p>
<p>at the end of July when two of the prisoners came down with
</p>
<p>diarrhea, and two more in August when two others succumbed to
</p>
<p>the heat and filth of the crowded jail and died of dysentery. The
</p>
<p>long delays wearied the survivors and frayed the professional court-
</p>
<p>room courtesy of the lawyers, who began snapping at each other
</p>
<p>in their heated legal wrangles. Not until September 4 did counsel
</p>
<p>begin their closing arguments to the jury and then for three weeks
</p>
<p>matched the heat of Indian summer with their perfervid oratory.
</p>
<p>These addresses were concluded on September 25 when the case
</p>
<p>went to the jury an issue welcomed by the judge on behalf of all
</p>
<p>with joyous relief.
</p>
<p>The prosecution in presenting its case first established the corpus
</p>
<p>delicti, namely, that a crime had been committed, that the depot
</p>
<p>fire had not been an accident but had been deliberately set. Several
</p>
<p>witnesses, most of them employees of the railroad company, stated
</p>

</p>
<p>that the fire could not have resulted from the overheating of the
</p>
<p>machinery used to elevate wheat and other freight to storage bins
</p>
<p>on the second story. They also declared that they had first seen the
</p>
<p>flames in the cupola of the building, high above the stored freight,
</p>
<p>[60]
</p>
<p>where Gay was alleged to have secreted the ignited "match." The
</p>
<p>cross-examination of these witnesses by the defense brought out the
</p>
<p>possible accidental causes of the fire, particularly the fact that work
</p>
<p>in the depot continued until midnight and that ordinary tallow
</p>
<p>candles in sconces fixed to posts throughout the building and over
</p>
<p>the wooden storage bins had been used for illumination. Seward
</p>
<p>and Frink insisted that the corpus delicti had not been proven by
</p>
<p>any means.
</p>
<p>The prosecution then brought its secret agents and informers to
</p>
<p>the stand to describe the hostility of the defendants to the com-
</p>
<p>pany, their secret meetings in Filley's tavern, and their criminal
</p>
<p>attacks on railroad property in Jackson County. The defense im-
</p>
<p>mediately offered strong objections to the admission of such evi-
</p>
<p>dence. Frink argued that the indictment was for a single offense and
</p>
<p>that the state could not seek to prove other offenses or go beyond
</p>
<p>proof of the agreement to hire Gay to burn the depot. Van Dyke,
</p>
<p>in reply, admitted that the indictment before the court was for
</p>
<p>the single offense of burning the depot in Detroit, but asserted that
</p>
<p>it was proper to introduce evidence tending to show the existence
</p>
<p>of a conspiracy generally to destroy the property of the railroad
</p>
<p>and embracing within it the design to burn the depot as charged.
</p>
<p>The crimes in Jackson County, he explained, were part of a grand
</p>
<p>scheme culminating in arson in Detroit. Seward countered by in-
</p>
<p>sisting that the defendants were being tried for one crime and one
</p>
<p>crime only, not for conspiracy, or treason, or larceny, but for arson;
</p>
<p>because they may have committed other crimes elsewhere and at
</p>
<p>other times did not prove that they burned the depot. After hear-
</p>
<p>ing both sides argue at length. Judge Wing decided in favor of the
</p>
<p>prosecution, ruling as admissible the testimony to prove all acts
</p>
<p>done under the general combination against the railroad. He did
</p>
<p>not think the introduction of such evidence would prejudice the
</p>
<p>defendants' case. As he later explained to the jury, the evidence
</p>
<p>thus received was not for the purpose of showing the defendants
</p>
<p>capable of committing the crime as charged; as such, it was in-
</p>
<p>admissible and irrelevant. "It was admitted," he made clear, "to

</p>
<p>show the original combination between the defendants, having
</p>
<p>in view the ultimate, though contingent, burning of the depot at
</p>
<p>Detroit; to show that as defendants were still working out their
</p>
<p>original plan, they had not abandoned it up to the period when the
</p>
<p>[61]
</p>
<p>depot was burned, and thus show or raise a presumption that
</p>
<p>their scheme was in full force when the depot was burned." That
</p>
<p>the jury of laymen could always appreciate the legal distinction
</p>
<p>and not allow themselves to be impressed by the guilt of the de-
</p>
<p>fendants in committing crimes in another jurisdiction for which
</p>
<p>they were not being tried was open to question. And the lawyers
</p>
<p>for the defense continued to take exception to the ruling of the
</p>
<p>court admitting such and similar evidence.
</p>
<p>The prosecution had, without doubt, won an important victory:
</p>
<p>all the evidence so carefully gathered by Clark and his agents for
</p>
<p>many months in Jackson County could now be used against the
</p>
<p>defendants. Witnesses were paraded before the court who detailed
</p>
<p>every expression of hostility, pointed or implicit, uttered by the
</p>
<p>defendants, drunk or sober, against the railroad and its policies.
</p>
<p>Every mishap along the line of the road between Grass Lake and
</p>
<p>Jackson was minutely recounted and by imputation fastened on
</p>
<p>the "conspirators." The meetings at Filley's tavern were blown up
</p>
<p>into "secret conclaves" of a deep conspiratorial nature. The wit-
</p>
<p>nesses emphasized the strong mutual loyalty of the defendants,
</p>
<p>their repeated boasts of how they would stand by each other and
</p>
<p>swear each other clear if any fell afoul of the law. And guiding
</p>
<p>them all, encouraging all, the state contended, was Fitch, shrewd
</p>
<p>and unscrupulous, hating the railroad and Brooks, and using his
</p>
<p>friends in his own personal war with the monster corporation,
</p>
<p>while he kept his own hands clean.
</p>
<p>On cross-examination, the defense pointedly brought out the
</p>
<p>casual and public nature of the meetings in a tavern open to all.
</p>
<p>It tried to discredit those witnesses who were in the pay of the
</p>
<p>company by suggesting that their motives were mercenary and that
</p>
<p>their wages were dependent on their providing the desired infor-
</p>
<p>mation. Some of the witnesses were also brought to admit that they
</p>
<p>had sometimes been accomplices and participants in attacks on
</p>
<p>railroad property.
</p>
<p>Wescott was one of the key witnesses for the prosecution. Under
</p>
<p>the skillful guidance of Van Arman, he related what he had heard

</p>
<p>and seen during the four months he had been at Michigan Centre
</p>
<p>as a spy. He underlined the testimony of previous witnesses about
</p>
<p>the determination and cohesion of the defendants in their hostility
</p>
<p>to the railroad. They had said many times in his presence, "Yes, we
</p>
<p>[62]
</p>
<p>are banded together and will stick together," and, "So long as we
</p>
<p>stick together all hell can't convict us." He told of his intimacy
</p>
<p>with Fitch and how the latter had confided in him and told him
</p>
<p>of the exploits of the boys at the Centre. He clearly pictured Fitch
</p>
<p>as the mastermind of the conspiracy, who with Filley had actually
</p>
<p>paid off the boys for each criminal task assigned. Wescott carried
</p>
<p>the state's case a great step fonvard by telling how Fitch had re-
</p>
<p>vealed to him his plan to climax the attacks on the railroad by
</p>
<p>burning the depots at Detroit, Ann Arbor, Jackson, and Niles,
</p>
<p>off ering $ 1 ,000 to anyone who would bum all four, or $250 for any
</p>
<p>one of them. Fitch, he said, had actually tried to get him to burn
</p>
<p>the Detroit depot. Conspiracy, motives, methods, intent Wescott
</p>
<p>happily supplied all the ingredients necessary for a conviction. He
</p>
<p>also for the first time linked Fitch with Gay and told how in dis-
</p>
<p>guise, he had trailed Fitch and Joe Dows, a notorious criminal,
</p>
<p>to Gay's house in Detroit in February, 1851.
</p>
<p>Frink and Seward could not shake Wescott's testimony on cross-
</p>
<p>examination. All they could do was to try and impeach his credi-
</p>
<p>bility by bringing out that he had once been indicted for forgery
</p>
<p>and again by suggesting that he had a direct financial stake in the
</p>
<p>case, that he expected a 1 1,000 reward if the defendants were con-
</p>
<p>victed by his testimony.
</p>
<p>The star witness for the prosecution was, of course, Henry
</p>
<p>Phelps. For a day and a half, under Van Arman's questioning,
</p>
<p>he cleverly and coolly wove a net of guilt around the defendants.
</p>
<p>He brought home the crime of arson to them. He revealed how
</p>
<p>they had hired him to burn the depot in Niles and "fixed him out"
</p>
<p>for the expedition in arson on the night of April 11, 1851, at
</p>
<p>Filley's tavern. They had supplied him that night with a "match"
</p>
<p>similar to the one they had given Gay to burn the depot in Detroit.
</p>
<p>Fitch, Filley, Price, Corwin, Williams, and Freeland had severally
</p>
<p>admitted to him that they had contributed to the purse raised for
</p>
<p>Gay. Gay on his part had confessed to him, Phelps, that he had been
</p>
<p>furnished the match by the men from the Centre and that on the
</p>
<p>night of the fire he had placed the ignited match in the cupola of

</p>
<p>the depot and that the boys had paid him for the job. Phelps
</p>
<p>further confirmed by personal knowledge that Fitch had been ac-
</p>
<p>quainted with Gay.
</p>
<p>Phelps was subjected to a severe probing cross-examination by
</p>
<p>[63]
</p>
<p>Frink and Seward for another day and a half. They tried in vain
</p>
<p>to get him to contradict himself, for he stuck to his story and
</p>
<p>parried all thrusts with great finesse. Defense counsel had to resort
</p>
<p>again to bringing out the details of his unsavory past, his business
</p>
<p>defaults, and his five year term in the state prison for horse-stealing.
</p>
<p>They impugned Phelps' motives by trying to show that he hated
</p>
<p>Fitch and wished to take revenge on him, but the witness denied
</p>
<p>any such feelings and insisted that Fitch had been one of his best
</p>
<p>friends. Phelps denied any and all villainies that the defense im-
</p>
<p>puted to him.
</p>
<p>Following Phelps on the stand, Heman Lake confirmed substan-
</p>
<p>tially all the testimony of his mentor. When counsel tried to im-
</p>
<p>peach his character, they incidentally revealed the main lines of
</p>
<p>the defense and offered too an amusing little byplay. Frink asked
</p>
<p>Lake where he had been lodging during the trial. Lake answered
</p>
<p>that he had boarded with Wescott most of the time he had been in
</p>
<p>Detroit but had also spent some time at the home of Gay's widow.
</p>
<p>When Frink followed this up by asking whether he had slept at the
</p>
<p>brothel, Stuart objected for the prosecution that the question was
</p>
<p>immaterial. Seward contended that the question was very much to
</p>
<p>the point, inasmuch as Lake was one of the state's chief witnesses
</p>
<p>and the defense was entitled to investigate him thoroughly. He
</p>
<p>added that his clients were charged with conspiracy, but he in-
</p>
<p>tended to prove that they were themselves the victims of a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy hatched by Phelps, Lake, and others in Gay's house; it was
</p>
<p>highly important, therefore, to show the conduct of one of the
</p>
<p>principals in such an atrocious plot. Van Dyke then pointed out
</p>
<p>that Lake had the privilege of refusing to answer the question if
</p>
<p>his reply tended to incriminate or degrade him. The judge upheld
</p>
<p>the point and Lake accordingly refused to answer. He was then
</p>
<p>asked: "Have you not since the death of Gay been in the constant
</p>
<p>practice of sleeping with the widow Gay?" Again the question was
</p>
<p>objected to on the ground that it involved a crime and could not
</p>
<p>be asked any more than a witness could be asked if he had com-
</p>
<p>mitted a murder. The court again upheld the objection and Lake

</p>
<p>did not answer.
</p>
<p>He did admit under further questioning, however, that he had
</p>
<p>taken Mrs. Gay to Marshall and then to Royal Oak to keep her
</p>
<p>from being called as a witness for the defense. Prosecuting Attorney
</p>
<p>[64]
</p>
<p>Stuart later admitted that Lake had done so at his suggestion. He
</p>
<p>explained that some of the lawyers for the defense had been "in the
</p>
<p>nightly practice of visiting and making improper approaches to this
</p>
<p>woman" and hoped to get her to testify for them, and that the
</p>
<p>prosecution therefore had taken measures to protect her from de-
</p>
<p>fense counsel so that "she might not be induced to become a witness
</p>
<p>in this case for the purpose of defeating the ends of public justice."
</p>
<p>Lake accordingly had been instructed to escort Mrs. Gay out of
</p>
<p>town.
</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the defense did not then rise to object to the
</p>
<p>ethics of the prosecution in spiriting away such a material witness.
</p>
<p>Seward resented, rather, the implication that he, as one of the law-
</p>
<p>yers for the defendants, had been the one who had frequently
</p>
<p>visited Mrs. Gay at the bawdy house. Van Dyke said he would
</p>
<p>freely exonerate Mr. Seward from the charge. William A. Howard
</p>
<p>also proclaimed his innocence. Hewitt finally came out and ad-
</p>
<p>mitted that he was the lawyer referred to, but assured the court
</p>
<p>that he had visited the widow purely in a professional capacity,
</p>
<p>believing that she knew something about the case. He had good
</p>
<p>reason, he explained, to believe from what Gay, his client, had told
</p>
<p>him before his death in jail, that Phelps and Lake had schemed
</p>
<p>with Gay to charge the defendants with the crime of arson and
</p>
<p>divide a $1,000 reward between them, and that Mrs. Gay was aware
</p>
<p>of the plot. He had therefore visited her several times to elicit this
</p>
<p>information from her but had been balked in his efforts by the
</p>
<p>presence of railroad agents.
</p>
<p>The prosecution completed its case on July 8 and rested. Frink
</p>
<p>immediately announced that he would present a motion, under the
</p>
<p>common law as well as the statute, to discharge twenty-four defend-
</p>
<p>ants against whom no criminal evidence had been adduced. On
</p>
<p>the advice of the court, however, he waited almost two weeks, and
</p>
<p>then after the defense had begun to present its case, asked the
</p>
<p>court to discharge or direct the jury to render a verdict in favor of
</p>
<p>six minor defendants against whom there was slight or no evidence.
</p>
<p>After lengthy arguments, the judge instructed the jury to find a

</p>
<p>verdict of "not guilty" for three, but decided to hold the rest for
</p>
<p>continued trial. The purpose of the defense, in making this move,
</p>
<p>was, no doubt, to gain a point with the jury by forcing it to realize
</p>
<p>the weakness of the prosecution's case. More important, they hoped
</p>
<p>[65]
</p>
<p>to get many of the defendants discharged at this stage so that they
</p>
<p>could serve as witnesses for the defense: while they were defendants
</p>
<p>they could not be called to the stand to testify, according to Mich-
</p>
<p>igan law. The purpose of the common law ruling allowing de-
</p>
<p>fendants to be freed before a trial was over was to prevent the
</p>
<p>prosecution from including in the indictment important witnesses
</p>
<p>against whom there was no real evidence in order to deprive the
</p>
<p>defense of their testimony. Fitch suspected that this was precisely
</p>
<p>so in the present case. "They have taken," he wrote his wife, "many
</p>
<p>these folks prisoners to exclude their testimony in my trial so I
</p>
<p>could not prove where I was so that their lying devils would not
</p>
<p>be detected in their false swearing ..." And though Van Dyke
</p>
<p>now argued that there was sufficient evidence against these defend-
</p>
<p>ants to hold them and the court agreed, it is noteworthy that at
</p>
<p>the end of the trial, he did not even ask for the conviction of twenty
</p>
<p>of the defendants originally named in the indictment.^'^
</p>
<p>With most of Fitch's and Filley's neighbors and friends thus dis-
</p>
<p>qualified from testifying, the defense found it almost impossible to
</p>
<p>dispute the incriminating evidence of Wescott, Phelps, and Lake.
</p>
<p>It had to try to catch up the hostile witnesses on circumstantial con-
</p>
<p>tradictions in their own testimony. Above all, as Fitch put it, "our
</p>
<p>whole effort must be made to impeach Phelps." But even this plan
</p>
<p>of defense was beset with unusual difficulties. Counsel felt ham-
</p>
<p>pered in their conduct of the defense by the difficulty of private
</p>
<p>access to their imprisoned clients. The latter, confined to jail and
</p>
<p>laid low by disease, could do almost nothing in their own behalf.
</p>
<p>Fitch, the target and the leader, could only call on his wife and his
</p>
<p>free friends to come to his aid. Money was needed to pay the
</p>
<p>lawyers and round up witnesses, and it was Fitch who raised the
</p>
<p>necessary sums, borrowing on mortgages, selling equipment, call-
</p>
<p>ing in a note, even giving a mortgage on his land, and eventually
</p>
<p>bankrupting his estate. At the very beginning of the defense's case,
</p>
<p>Frink and Howard had to write Superintendent Brooks asking for
</p>
<p>passes on the railroad for witnesses they wished to bring to Detroit,
</p>
<p>in the same manner as the prosecution witnesses had been "passed"

<p>over the road. "The defendants," they explained, "with one or two
</p>
<p>exceptions are too poor to pay for procuring the witnesses necessary
</p>
<p>to their defense." ^
</p>
<p>Despite all these difficulties, the defense was able to produce a
</p>
<p>[66]
</p>
<p>great number of witnesses and present a strong case. Some witnesses
</p>
<p>from Jackson and Washtenaw counties, having read about the case
</p>
<p>in the newspapers or heard it discussed, recalled pertinent informa-
</p>
<p>tion and came forward voluntarily, out of sympathy for the de-
</p>
<p>fendants or dislike for Phelps and the railroad. Most of them,
</p>
<p>however, were rounded up by Fitch's devoted friends: Anson Dela-
</p>
<p>mater, Henry S. Holcomb, Edward Higby, and Isaac D. Toll, farm-
</p>
<p>ers and merchants of Jackson, Michigan Centre, and vicinity.
</p>
<p>These men did the field work, tracking down leads, interviewing
</p>
<p>prospective witnesses, taking down their depositions, and bring-
</p>
<p>ing them to Detroit to court.
</p>
<p>In opening the case for the defense, William A. Howard tried
</p>
<p>to surmount another great handicap with which the prosecution
</p>
<p>had hobbled its opponents. He referred to the "ingenious at-
</p>
<p>tempts" to prejudice the jury by the introduction of evidence
</p>
<p>that the defendants had boasted that no jury would ever convict
</p>
<p>them, that they could bring any number of witnesses to swear
</p>
<p>them clear. The prosecution, Howard charged, wished the jury
</p>
<p>to look "with a jealous eye" on all defense witnesses. He said that
</p>
<p>"the prosecution reminded him of the invention of a pair of yellow
</p>
<p>glass spectacles which caused lard to look like butter. They viewed
</p>
<p>everything through colored glass and the acts of all the prisoners
</p>
<p>looked bilious in their visions."
</p>
<p>Howard's counterattack may have helped the defense in over-
</p>
<p>coming the stigma of premeditated perjury, but it eventually
</p>
<p>proved futile when one of the defense witnesses broke down and
</p>
<p>confessed to that very crime. John Hawley of Indiana testified on
</p>
<p>July 15 that Phelps had in the previous September come to see him
</p>
<p>and offered him $50 to burn the Detroit depot and swear it on to
</p>
<p>some men who lived on the railroad and thus share the reward that
</p>
<p>the company would offer. If true, Hawley's testimony would have
</p>
<p>gone a long way toward destroying Phelps' credibility and raised
</p>
<p>the presumption that it was he who was guilty of conspiracy. Un-
</p>
<p>fortunately for the defense, Hawley was arrested the next day and
</p>
<p>charged with perjury. Stuart announced in court that Hawley had

</p>
<p>admitted that his testimony had been entirely fabricated and that
</p>
<p>he had never seen Phelps until he had come into the courtroom.
</p>
<p>After the defense had closed, Stuart cleverly produced Hawley in
</p>
<p>court and there the latter made a complete confession of how he
</p>
<p>[67 ]
</p>
<p>had been bribed by Elder Billings, the minister at Jackson prison
</p>
<p>who had been active on behalf of the defense, to commit perjury.
</p>
<p>He now declared that his conscience had bothered him and he
</p>
<p>wished to make a clean breast. At one blow, the statements of every
</p>
<p>defense witness was placed under a dark cloud. True, Seward in
</p>
<p>his closing argument to the jury, disclaimed responsibility for
</p>
<p>Hawley and stated that he had been maliciously imposed on the
</p>
<p>defense by enemies of Phelps. He disowned Hawley as a "silly
</p>
<p>fool" and declared that others with like testimony had been re-
</p>
<p>jected by the defense itself. On the whole, however, the Hawley
</p>
<p>incident must have greatly harmed the defense, and the prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion, in its final pleas to the jury, hammered away strongly at the
</p>
<p>point.
</p>
<p>The case for the defense or at least its impact on the jury was
</p>
<p>further weakened by the relentless and highly eflEective cross-
</p>
<p>examination to which its witnesses were subjected by the prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion lawyers, Van Arman and Van Dyke. With the canny Phelps
</p>
<p>at their elbows, advising and giving them leads, the two were able
</p>
<p>to trip up the country bumpkins who appeared for the defense.
</p>
<p>Some of these farmers spoke of the two lawyers as being "rather like
</p>
<p>badgers" and complained of being browbeaten. Van Arman, in
</p>
<p>particular, savagely and skilfully plied the witnesses with a barrage
</p>
<p>of questions on circumstantial details that confused and exasper-
</p>
<p>ated them and must have raised some doubts in the jury's minds
</p>
<p>about their general credibility. Van Arman here laid the basis for
</p>
<p>his reputation as a highly skilled cross-examiner. Thickset and
</p>
<p>swarthy as an Indian, with a magnificent head and a strong lower
</p>
<p>jaw, he overawed the witnesses he faced. But one witness amusingly
</p>
<p>turned the tables on his tormentor. Asked by Van Arman what he
</p>
<p>and a friend had been talking about, he replied, "He said . . . that
</p>
<p>there was one dark-skinned, ugly-looking specimen that was a
</p>
<p>pretty saucy fellow for whom a man had better keep his eye
</p>
<p>skinned, that he was rather a scabby fellow . . . and told me to
</p>
<p>look out for him." The witness then coyly added, "He didn't tell
</p>
<p>his name, but he was one of the lawyers." Laughter in the court-

</p>
<p>room greeted the exchange as Van Arman asked again, "Didn't
</p>
<p>he say that Van Arman was the man?" Came the reply, "He didn't
</p>
<p>say who he was only he was a scabby man and told me to look out
</p>
<p>for him as he would browbeat me pretty well." A moment later,
</p>
<p>[68]
</p>
<p>this witness tried to prove he would not be browbeaten when, in
</p>
<p>answer to Van Arman's insistent questioning on some point, he
</p>
<p>said, "I might or might not; don't remember as I did; I won't want
</p>
<p>to be humbugged any longer; I told you all about it." Directed by
</p>
<p>the court to answer, he replied non-committally and then parried
</p>
<p>the next question, "If he did say anything, he may have said so;
</p>
<p>if he said so why he said so." And the court again had to order
</p>
<p>him to answer properly. Other witnesses were badgered and con-
</p>
<p>fused on cross-examination to the point of helplessness. As one
</p>
<p>said to Van Dyke: "You keep rattling around so that I can't find
</p>
<p>what you are at . . . You mix it up so I can't tell when the day
</p>
<p>was I saw [him]." ^^
</p>
<p>The defense lawyers by comparison were not nearly so effective.
</p>
<p>Seward and Frink, who did most of the courtroom work for the
</p>
<p>defense, were overshadowed by their opposites in this respect.
</p>
<p>Frink's sympathy for his clients was no substitute for ability. And
</p>
<p>Seward, for all his astuteness and driving logic, which sometimes
</p>
<p>verged on sophistry, just did not shine in cross-examination. Slight
</p>
<p>and wiry, with his long narrow head and big nose, thick grizzled
</p>
<p>hair, and careless dress, the Senator impressed those who agreed
</p>
<p>with him with his rugged honesty and ability, his calm dignity. As
</p>
<p>Henry Adams once remarked: "There's no shake in him. He talks
</p>
<p>square up to the mark and something beyond it." To a less sympa-
</p>
<p>thetic observer in that courtroom, he seemed like "a pet fox made
</p>
<p>vain by adulation. . ." "He sits," this acidulous reporter continued,
</p>
<p>"pursing his mouth like a toothless old lady, his twinkling grey
</p>
<p>eyes see all in the room. When speaking to a witness, he rubs his
</p>
<p>hands in exultation; then gives his head a toss. . ." Nor did the
</p>
<p>prosecution lawyers hesitate to taunt the Senator from New York,
</p>
<p>whose public office and peculiar political views laid him open to
</p>
<p>attack. They made slighting references to the "higher law" and to
</p>
<p>the morals of men in public life. Van Arman, a Democrat, brazenly
</p>
<p>accused Seward of vanity inflated by "the fulsome adulation of
</p>
<p>partizan editors and the interested flattery of partizan friends. , ."
</p>
<p>Even Judge Wing could not resist joining in such hardly proper

<p>depreciation. One Saturday afternoon, while court was met on the
</p>
<p>second floor of the city hall, Seward requested an early adjourn-

</p>
<p>loons
</p>
<p>April 1 1, the day they said they had come to the Centre to get the
</p>
<p>match and be "fixed out" for the trip to Niles to burn the depot
</p>
<p>there. According to the story now brought out in court, Phelps
</p>
<p>and Lake had brought the match encased in a box to Michigan
</p>
<p>Centre themselves, deposited it with Filley for safekeeping, had
</p>
<p>then inveigled the boys to the tavern at the Centre on the pretext
</p>
<p>of free drinks and a game of bowls, and finally that evening asked
</p>
<p>for and received the box from Filley. The railroad agent who had
</p>
<p>been sent there by Clark for the purpose of witnessing the "fixing
</p>
<p>out" had seen only a box being delivered to Phelps. The whole
</p>
<p>series of events related by Phelps and Lake had been nothing but
</p>
<p>a clever fabrication of circumstances to make it seem as if Filley,
</p>
<p>Fitch, and the rest had provided the two informers with a match
</p>
<p>to burn the Niles depot. On the stand a second time, Phelps and
</p>
<p>Lake denied everything and stuck to their original story.
</p>
<p>The defense also brought evidence into court to contradict Wes-
</p>
<p>cott. The picket fence around Fitch's house, through which Wes-
</p>
<p>cott had said he had crawled to eavesdrop, was produced in order
</p>
<p>to show that no pickets had been removed and that nobody could
</p>
<p>have crawled through or under it. The Fitches' adopted daughter,
</p>
<p>Amanda, and their hired girl further showed that W'escott could
</p>
<p>not have overheard Fitch and his wife discussing the campaign
</p>
<p>against the railroad, as he said he did, in bed in their first-floor
</p>
<p>bedroom, for they had slept upstairs on the second floor that sum-
</p>
<p>mer. Little Abel Fitch, the adopted son, further testified that the
</p>
<p>hole under Filley 's barroom was too small for him to crawl into,
</p>
<p>let alone the adult Wescott.
</p>
<p>The whole case against Fitch and company, the defense now con-
</p>
<p>tended, was nothing but a conspiracy on the part of Phelps, Lake,
</p>
<p>and Wescott. The three had cleverly contrived a chain of circum-
</p>
<p>stance that pointed to the guilt of the men from Michigan Centre
</p>
<p>in burning the depot and then strengthened it with their own testi-
</p>
<p>mony of criminal admissions. But there was evidence, "dead, cold
</p>
<p>mute, inanimate matter" that they had overlooked, that spoke in
</p>
<p>"thunder tones" of the innocence of the defendants. The defense

</p>
<p>then exhibited a log of whitewood which had been found buried
</p>
<p>under the hay in an old shack on the farm that Phelps had lived
</p>
<p>on till shortly before the arrests. The log was of the same kind of
</p>
<p>wood and of the same dimensions as the match which Phelps said
</p>
<p>[71 ]
</p>
<p>the defendants had given him. The inference that Phelps had made
</p>
<p>the match himself and used it to incriminate the innocent, the
</p>
<p>prosecution waved airily aside on cross-examination, by suggesting
</p>
<p>that the defense itself had placed the log on Phelps' land. But other
</p>
<p>witnesses then testified that two or three weeks before the match
</p>
<p>had first been seen by Clark and Van Arman, Phelps and Lake had
</p>
<p>borrowed augers the identical size of the holes drilled in the match
</p>
<p>from one of their neighbors and that Lake had been seen at work
</p>
<p>with the augers on a log of whitewood, with the shavings lying on
</p>
<p>the floor about him.
</p>
<p>And why had Phelps and Wescott conspired against Fitch? Be-
</p>
<p>cause they hated him. Phelps, while still serving his term in Jack-
</p>
<p>son, had told the foreman of the prison machine shop that "he was
</p>
<p>in prison through the influence of Fitch and others, and that, if he
</p>
<p>lived to get out, he would make them sweat for it, and give them
</p>
<p>the same feed they had given him." Another prison official told,
</p>
<p>on the stand, how once when Fitch had been visiting the jail,
</p>
<p>Phelps had pointed to him and said: "If you knew him as well as
</p>
<p>I do, you would not think much of him; he was the means of my
</p>
<p>being here and I'll have revenge or satisfaction."
</p>
<p>Phelps, recalled to the stand, said he did not remember having
</p>
<p>said any such thing and insisted that Fitch was a good friend of his.
</p>
<p>Another witness, however, brought out that the previous January,
</p>
<p>when Phelps and his wife had spent the night in his home, he had
</p>
<p>overheard the couple whispering in another bed in the same bed-
</p>
<p>room. Mrs. Phelps had asked her husband if he was going to see
</p>
<p>Fitch the next day and if he thought he could do as he calculated to
</p>
<p>do. Phelps had replied that if Wescott would do as he had agreed
</p>
<p>to do and stick by, he thought he would "come a good drive." It
</p>
<p>certainly seemed as if Phelps and Wescott were working in concert
</p>
<p>to make money from the railroad by swearing a crime against their
</p>
<p>common enemy. For Wescott, too, according to one witness, had
</p>
<p>once openly declared that Fitch was a notorious scoundrel who
</p>
<p>would appear as a friend to your face, and the moment you turned
</p>
<p>your back would run a dagger through your heart and that he

</p>
<p>(Wescott) would see him "peeping through the grates yet."
</p>
<p>Having proved to its satisfaction that Phelps, Lake, and Wescott
</p>
<p>had fashioned a broad net of lies to entrap Fitch and his friends,
</p>
<p>the defense then delivered what it felt to be the coup de grace to
</p>
<p>[72]
</p>
<p>the prosecution's case. It produced witnesses to show that the cele-
</p>
<p>brated match simply would not burn when ignited. The witnesses
</p>
<p>told of experiments conducted by Seward, Howard, Frink, and
</p>
<p>others on a match made according to the specifications Phelps had
</p>
<p>given in court: the cotton soaked in camphene had been placed in
</p>
<p>the holes in the log and ignited, but the log had never caught fire,
</p>
<p>even after four or five attempts. The whole case of the prosecution,
</p>
<p>the defense suggested, was not only false; it could not have possibly
</p>
<p>been true. It had not been convincingly proven, moreover, that the
</p>
<p>fire in the depot had been deliberately set. Several witnesses testi-
</p>
<p>fied for the defense that they had first seen the flames elsewhere
</p>
<p>than in the cupola, where they should have been if Gay had really
</p>
<p>put the match there. Gay, besides, had been disabled at the time
</p>
<p>and had to use crutches and could not have carried the match all
</p>
<p>the way up to the cupola. His unwonted prosperity in the month
</p>
<p>of the fire had not been due to his payment by the "conspirators,"
</p>
<p>but, as his own son now swore, to the payment of several notes that
</p>
<p>he had held.
</p>
<p>In rebuttal, the prosecution brought 118 witnesses who testified
</p>
<p>that they had never heard Phelps' reputation for truth questioned
</p>
<p>and that they would believe him under oath. A county judge, mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the legislature, lawyers, doctors, ministers, merchants, and
</p>
<p>farmers, as well as other prison officials, appeared in behalf of the
</p>
<p>state's star witness, asserting that from 1840 to the time of his sen-
</p>
<p>tence for horse stealing they had generally found Phelps trust-
</p>
<p>worthy and had not been aware of any reflections on his truthful-
</p>
<p>ness in the communities in which he had lived. Many of them ad-
</p>
<p>mitted, however, on cross-examination, that they had not known
</p>
<p>Phelps too well and most of them revealed that since the trial
</p>
<p>had begun, they had heard some people speak "very hard" of
</p>
<p>Phelps, that "enough [had been] said of him to hang the devil,"
</p>
<p>that they had "heard a general bark about him lately."
</p>
<p>Mrs. Phelps herself denied on the stand that she and her husband
</p>
<p>had ever whispered in bed about a scheme with Wescott to "come
</p>
<p>a good drive" over Fitch. Indeed, Henry had always looked on

</p>
<p>Fitch as his friend. She explained, moreover, that Lake had bor-
</p>
<p>rowed the augers solely for the purpose of mending the springs on
</p>
<p>their buggy and had returned them the same day. Additional wit-
</p>
<p>nesses then contradicted important points established by the de-
</p>
<p>[73]
</p>
<p>fense: the flames had been first seen issuing from the cupola of the
</p>
<p>depot; Fitch had been abed in the downstairs room when a tenant
</p>
<p>of his had come to see him one morning in the summer of 1850.
</p>
<p>As for the log of whitewood found on Phelps' premises, it had been
</p>
<p>unearthed at the suggestion of the crafty Burnett and, by implica-
</p>
<p>tion, had probably been planted there. Furthermore, the prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion now brought out. Elder Billings, who had bribed one witness
</p>
<p>to perjure himself, had tried to get a match made in order to
</p>
<p>secrete it in Phelps' house. While this plan had not been carried
</p>
<p>out, was it not likely that the whitewood log had been the next best
</p>
<p>substitute? The state then put Dr. Edmund G. Desnoyers, a Detroit
</p>
<p>chemist, on the stand to prove that the match if ignited would
</p>
<p>burst into flame. The experiment took a long time and much effort,
</p>
<p>and a substitute for camphene, which would not work as specified,
</p>
<p>had to be used, but there was no doubt that the match was the
</p>
<p>incendiary instrument used to burn the depot.
</p>
<p>At this point, Van Arman launched a sharp attack on the cred-
</p>
<p>ibility of all the defense witnesses. One farmer and his son had
</p>
<p>testified for the defense that on April 1 1 they had seen Phelps and
</p>
<p>Lake part company on the way to Michigan Centre and that the
</p>
<p>latter had carried a bundle the size of the match wrapped in red.
</p>
<p>The prosecution had sent men out to the farm in question, and
</p>
<p>they reported that from where the farmer and his son had stood,
</p>
<p>no one could see passers-by on the road much less a bundle carried
</p>
<p>under the arm. Van Arman suggested that the jury go out to the
</p>
<p>farm and see for itself. He urged haste, for as the place was so near
</p>
<p>Leoni, "the defense will bring twenty or thirty to swear away every
</p>
<p>fence and tree about the place. . ." Seward objected strongly to
</p>
<p>these personal aspersions and countered with some slighting re-
</p>
<p>marks about Van Arman's dual role as counsel for the people and
</p>
<p>agent of the railroad, who had "descended to the haunts of vice"
</p>
<p>to secure evidence. With regard to a visit to the field near Leoni,
</p>
<p>Seward charged that the prosecution lawyers had already inspected
</p>
<p>the place in the company of one of the jurors, and sarcastically
</p>
<p>added that, this time, he hoped defense counsel would be per-

</p>
<p>mitted to go along. Van Arman, standing on his dignity, said he
</p>
<p>would not reply "to the tirade of the counsel, which he presumes
</p>
<p>is meant merely for the public." Being thick-skinned, he was not
</p>
<p>at all wounded by the pointed remarks. True, he had visited a
</p>
<p>[74]
</p>
<p>"haunt of vice," but he had "testified to truth he knew, while the
</p>
<p>other counsel was here for months seeking to screen guilt. . ."
</p>
<p>At this point, the court interrupted with the remark that the
</p>
<p>matter had gone far enough. Prosecuting Attorney Stuart inter-
</p>
<p>jected that he thought Van Arman had not gone "near so far" as
</p>
<p>the defense counsel in rude and indecent personal attacks. Judge
</p>
<p>Wing replied that he had no wish to prevent counsel from reply-
</p>
<p>ing to any attack on his integrity but merely desired to prevent
</p>
<p>excitement. Van Arman would not, however, remain silent. He
</p>
<p>defended his own actions by citing his high motives, to prevent the
</p>
<p>destruction of life and property on the railroad. He insinuated
</p>
<p>that Seward's motives in endlessly delaying the trial had not been
</p>
<p>so pure, that he hoped to break up the trial by the death or illness
</p>
<p>of a juror or give the defendants time to concoct perjury. Such
</p>
<p>conduct, he sneered, could not be distinguished "in point of
</p>
<p>morality from helping the defendants out of prison by handing
</p>
<p>them a file."
</p>
<p>After this bitter contretemps the prosecution recalled Phelps and
</p>
<p>Lake to the stand to deny that they had made any matches, or knew
</p>
<p>anything about the log of whitewood found in the hay, or had sep-
</p>
<p>arated on April n, or brought any box to Michigan Centre that
</p>
<p>day. With this, the state completed its rebuttal and rested.
</p>
<p>In many respects, the climax of the trial had already been passed.
</p>
<p>On August 24, Abel F. Fitch had died in the Sisters of Charity Hos-
</p>
<p>pital to which he had been removed from his cell in moribund con-
</p>
<p>dition. He had been taken sick with dysentery on August 12 and
</p>
<p>by August 15 could no longer appear in court, which then ad-
</p>
<p>journed from day to day for almost two weeks. After his death, the
</p>
<p>trial continued to its appointed end, but the proceedings were
</p>
<p>something of an anticlimax. The chief defendant was no longer on
</p>
<p>trial; he had gone, as the piety of the time would have it, to appear
</p>
<p>before a higher tribunal. The prosecution persisted in its efforts of
</p>
<p>getting a conviction and setting an example to other opponents of
</p>
<p>the railroad, but the defense lost its spark with the death of a sick
</p>
<p>and lonely man.

</p>
<p>All during the long hot days in court and the miserable hot
</p>
<p>nights in jail. Fitch's hope and health had wasted away. In his now
</p>
<p>sporadic letters home, disease and despair were the keynotes. He
</p>
<p>continued to proclaim his innocence to Amanda and took some
</p>
<p>[75]
</p>
<p>comfort from the fact that Seward, "the old guv," as he fondly
</p>
<p>called him, was convinced of it too. He felt sure that the railroad
</p>
<p>lawyers knew he was not guilty and was all the more appalled at
</p>
<p>their determined efforts to secure a conviction. It all seemed so
</p>
<p>unreal to him, so like a dream. "It does not seem possible," he told
</p>
<p>his wife, "that we can be sworn to States Prison by such devils,
</p>
<p>[but] they say I shall never breath one half hour of free air while I
</p>
<p>live." Resigning himself to a martyr's fate, he cried:
</p>
<p>If this RR company must rule this State why the sooner we know
</p>
<p>it the better and perhaps I may as well be the first victim as the last. . .
</p>
<p>If this is all due and in accordance with the principals of our government
</p>
<p>and the people of Michigan are wilhng to submit to it why I must of
</p>
<p>course suffer but God only knows whos turn will come next.
</p>
<p>Again in that dark hour, his mind turned to his dearest Amanda.
</p>
<p>On August 12, his yearning burst forth: "How much I want to see
</p>
<p>you and be again at my peaceable home with my quiet little family,
</p>
<p>language cannot express." It was his last letter home.'^^
</p>
<p>Two days later, on August 14, Fitch took to his bed, never to
</p>
<p>leave it. A week later the dying man was removed from his cell to
</p>
<p>the hospital. Amanda came from Michigan Centre to be with him
</p>
<p>in his last moments. An eyewitness wrote the following account
</p>
<p>of the end:
</p>
<p>At 3 o'clock P.M. yesterday, Mr. Fitch became conscious that he could
</p>
<p>not live, and talked calmly and firmly of his approaching death. He
</p>
<p>desired that Mr. Frink might be sent for, to consult about his worldly
</p>
<p>matters. Prosecuting Attorney Stuart and Doctors Rice and Pitcher
</p>
<p>arrived about 10 o'clock. An examination and consultation was had, and
</p>
<p>the opinion expressed that he could not survive the night. Mr. Stuart
</p>
<p>went to the bedside of the dying man when he (Fitch) inquired, "What
</p>
<p>is to be done now?" and said, "I shall die a martyr to liberty." Soon
</p>
<p>after, he remarked that he put his trust in God, and desired that he might
</p>
<p>be baptised. He received the solemn rite at the hand of one of the Sisters
</p>
<p>of Charity; and whilst in the midst of the ceremony, while committing
</p>
<p>his soul to God, he declared his entire innocence of the crimes with
</p>
<p>which he was charged said he had never violated the laws of his country

</p>
<p>that he had simply expressed his opinions, as he supposed he had a
</p>
<p>right to do, and thought it not just that he should be punished.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitch then called his wife to him, bid her good bye, saying,
</p>
<p>"Farewelll it is hard to part with the only being I ever loved"; and then
</p>
<p>bidding adieu to other friends around him, closed his eyes for a moment.
</p>
<p>Recovering again, he exclaimed, "There is poor, dear little Amanda I
</p>
<p>had nearly forgotten her remember me to her. I dread to die with this
</p>
<p>[76]
</p>
<p>charge resting upon me. Will not the truth come out and my character
</p>
<p>be vindicated?" Being assured by Mr. Frink that his character should be
</p>
<p>vindicated, he expressed himself prepared to die; and taking the hand of
</p>
<p>his wife, and pressing it to his lips, he said, "Amanda, it is hard to part
</p>
<p>I die of a broken heartl" and fell back, asleep in death.''^
</p>
<p>That night the body was brought to Michigan Centre, and to
</p>
<p>Jackson the next morning for the funeral. A procession of carriages
</p>
<p>and teams nearly a half mile long accompanied the coffin from the
</p>
<p>Centre. The Congregational Church of Jackson, where the last
</p>
<p>services were held, was filled to overflowing, with people crowding
</p>
<p>around the doors and windows. The Reverend Gustavus L. Foster
</p>
<p>preached the funeral sermon, taking his text from Job lo: 22,
</p>
<p>"Without any order." Death and affliction often seemed to men as
</p>
<p>without any order, the preacher pointed out; and Fitch's death
</p>
<p>seemed to his many friends who believed in his innocence to be so.
</p>
<p>In God's wisdom and knowledge, however, nothing was without
</p>
<p>order. Mr. Foster, with characteristic boldness, then proceeded to
</p>
<p>attack the authorities and the railroad company as being largely
</p>
<p>responsible for Fitch's death. He condemned "in the name of hu-
</p>
<p>manity" the refusal of the courts to grant Fitch bail and character-
</p>
<p>ized the treatment he had received in prison as "an arbitrary rigid-
</p>
<p>ity, amounting well-nigh to the infliction of cruelty. . ." Nor could
</p>
<p>one expect more from "heavy monied corporations" that existed
</p>
<p>only for gain and violated the Sabbath by running trains on Sun-
</p>
<p>days. "Many of the men composing the company owning this Rail
</p>
<p>Road may be good men, spending much of their time in Psalm
</p>
<p>singing in eastern churches," but their minions in Michigan reck-
</p>
<p>lessly trampled on civil and divine law every Sabbath day. Such a
</p>
<p>corporation was bound to act as it did to defend its rights, but indi-
</p>
<p>viduals too had rights, especially when "arraigned before a civil
</p>
<p>tribunal which should never feel the bias of a moneyed anxiety."
</p>
<p>The preacher did not shower the deceased with immoderate praise.
</p>
<p>Fitch, he said, had been neither a saint nor a vile creature, but a
</p>
<p>worthy man, who had never turned the poor away from his door
</p>
<p>and whose generosity had won him more friends than any other

</p>
<p>man in the region.^^
</p>
<p>The death of Fitch, though it shook the defense, brought it fresh
</p>
<p>accessions of public support and sympathy. As the astute James F.
</p>
<p>Joy discerned, it was bound to have repercussions that might affect
</p>
<p>[77]
</p>
<p>the outcome of the trial. The day of the funeral, Joy was writing
</p>
<p>to Superintendent Brooks that Fitch's death would "undoubtedly
</p>
<p>have a great effect on the public mind" and cautioned against al-
</p>
<p>lowing anybody connected with the railroad to make "injudicious
</p>
<p>remarks." He added cannily,
</p>
<p>if anything be said, it should be to express regret at the course taken
</p>
<p>by the defendants' counsel which has protracted the trial through the hot
</p>
<p>season and sympathy for the family of Fitch. Better however say nothing
</p>
<p>and give no occasion for any invidious remark."
</p>
<p>Sympathy needed, however, no new occasion for invidious re-
</p>
<p>marks. As the wife of one of the other prisoners informed her hus-
</p>
<p>band with almost hysterical unbelief: "News has just reached us of
</p>
<p>Mr. Fitch's death and my God can it be true. . . This company I
</p>
<p>believe means to keep you there till they kill you all." The Jack-
</p>
<p>son American Citizen spoke of the "universal sadness thrown over
</p>
<p>our community" by the death of "one of the victims of the jealousy
</p>
<p>and malice of the Central Railroad monopoly. . ." For the editor
</p>
<p>of this Whig antirailroad paper, the death of Fitch only under-
</p>
<p>lined his opinion, expressed earlier, that the trial and the charges
</p>
<p>were a mesh of lies; though other newspapers on the line and north
</p>
<p>of the road had been constantly manufacturing opinion in favor of
</p>
<p>the corporation, he would not be deterred from honest criticism
</p>
<p>by fear of a monopoly of a few foreign capitalists and their local
</p>
<p>political hucksters. Now, he reprinted in full the eyewitness ac-
</p>
<p>count of Fitch's death which the Detroit Daily Tribune had
</p>
<p>printed and added the charge that Fitch had not been treated
</p>
<p>fairly in his last illness. William Gunn, another prisoner who had
</p>
<p>died of the same disease a day or so later, had been removed to the
</p>
<p>hospital at the first sign of illness, while Fitch had not been taken
</p>
<p>there until he had been pronounced incurable. The editor then
</p>
<p>followed this charge up by publishing the whole of the Reverend
</p>
<p>Foster's funeral sermon on the front page and preparing copies
</p>
<p>of it for distribution in pamphlet form. A little later, sentiment
</p>
<p>bubbled over into bad verse when there appeared in the columns
</p>
<p>of the American Citizen the following anonymous "Lines Written

</p>
<p>Upon the Occasion of the Death of Abel F. Fitch:"
</p>
<p>Malice, hate, envy, all combined.
</p>
<p>His peace they would destroy,
</p>
<p>[78]
</p>
<p>They tore him from the sacred arms
</p>
<p>Of home and all its joys.
</p>
<p>They dragged him to a felon's cell-
</p>
<p>There in that evil hour.
</p>
<p>His heart was crushed, the strong man fell
</p>
<p>Beneath oppression's power.
</p>
<p>Worn out at last with dire disease
</p>
<p>And anguish's keener smart.
</p>
<p>Faintly in death's cold arms he said
</p>
<p>I die of a broken heart.
</p>
<p>Ye men of monied power and might,
</p>
<p>Hear ye those dying words.
</p>
<p>Look at the lonely widow's form.
</p>
<p>And see the wreck that ye have made.'^
</p>
<p>Sympathy for the deceased and doubts of his guilt were not con-
</p>
<p>fined to Jackson County. The official organ of the Baptists of Mich-
</p>
<p>igan, published in Detroit, did not hesitate to celebrate Fitch's vir-
</p>
<p>tues and, while withholding comment on the trial, declared that
</p>
<p>the public mind was divided on the question of his guilt. The De-
</p>
<p>troit Daily Tribune itself, which four months previously had led
</p>
<p>the pack in the outcry against the desperados from Jackson County,
</p>
<p>now called Fitch a man who had been known in his community as
</p>
<p>kind, conscientious, and charitable, and printed the dramatic
</p>
<p>deathbed account. This newspaper's reversal was neither as sudden
</p>
<p>nor as capricious as it seemed. Voicing the views of Free-Soil Whigs,
</p>
<p>it could no longer escape the conclusion that the interests of the
</p>
<p>railroad and the political fortunes of the Democratic administra-
</p>
<p>tion were closely bound together in the prosecution. Early in
</p>
<p>August, after the defense had already presented most of its case,
</p>
<p>the Tribune had begun to express editorial doubts about the guilt
</p>
<p>of the defendants. A week later, it affirmed "that there is a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy on one side or the other" and warned that if other news-
</p>
<p>papers "enlisted" on the side of the railroad, the Tribune would
</p>
<p>not "be awed by wealth no matter how great into silence." It
</p>
<p>cautioned the prosecution that monied power must be used pru-

</p>
<p>dently and "never to control public opinion. Courts, Juries, the
</p>
<p>Press, or oppress the weak and the poor." Journalistic attacks on
</p>
<p>the defendants and their counsel would not help the railroad's
</p>
<p>cause, for there was too much respect for law and justice in the city
</p>
<p>[79]
</p>
<p>of Detroit, "too much hatred of oppression and tyranny whether
</p>
<p>manifested by governments or corporations." "^^
</p>
<p>Sympathy for the defendants strengthened the feeling of the
</p>
<p>righteousness of their original cause opposition to the Michigan
</p>
<p>Central Railroad. Antirailroad sentiment, set back by the sudden
</p>
<p>strike of the arrests and held at bay by the judicial proceedings,
</p>
<p>now flared up once more, fueled by the passions arising out of the
</p>
<p>trial. The focus of this opposition was naturally in Jackson County.
</p>
<p>Four days after Fitch's death, an "indignation meeting" was held
</p>
<p>at the courthouse in Jackson to allow the citizens to vent their
</p>
<p>feelings about the trial and "to ask," as one sympathizer expressed
</p>
<p>it in a letter to the editor, "if our hardy yeomanry stand ready to
</p>
<p>be humbled at the beck or nod of the agents of a great monied
</p>
<p>monopoly." The speakers at the crowded gathering were careful
</p>
<p>to blame both parties, the men of Leoni as well as the Michigan
</p>
<p>Central. The company had precipitated the trouble by not paying
</p>
<p>enough for cattle killed, but this was no excuse for damaging rail-
</p>
<p>road property, and those who did so should be punished. Resolu-
</p>
<p>tions were passed protesting the company's use of spies, the manner
</p>
<p>of the arrests, the excessive bail, the filthy conditions of the jail,
</p>
<p>and the treatment of the prisoners in a way "as would have dis-
</p>
<p>graced an Austrian Bastille." It was charged, too, that many in-
</p>
<p>nocent persons had been arrested to keep them from appearing as
</p>
<p>witnesses for the defense. Finally, the hope was expressed that the
</p>
<p>opposition to the railroad in the future would stay within legal
</p>
<p>limits and would not descend to criminal violence, but would up-
</p>
<p>hold the right and further all means to encourage competition
</p>
<p>with the Michigan Central. At the close of the meeting, a com-
</p>
<p>mittee was selected to prepare for a larger mass meeting on Sep-
</p>
<p>tember 13 which would give in resounding tones "the verdict of the
</p>
<p>People as to Right in the unholy war." '^'^
</p>
<p>The judicious tenor of the indignation meeting, culminating in
</p>
<p>the proposal to restore competition, suggests an inspiration far
</p>
<p>removed from the violent anger of farmers whose only piece of live-
</p>
<p>stock had been killed on the tracks. This first gathering obviously

</p>
<p>laid the ground for the well-organized and well-publicized mass
</p>
<p>meeting of September 13, which was dominated by outstanding
</p>
<p>merchants and politicos of the community who were not averse to
</p>
<p>using the resentments aroused by the trial to further their own
</p>
<p>[80]
</p>
<p>ends. The second meeting, heralded by the American Citizen as
</p>
<p>"5000 Freemen in Council," condemned the authorities for their
</p>
<p>conduct of the trial in the same terms as its predecessor. It too re-
</p>
<p>gretted the criminal attacks on the railroad on the one hand, and
</p>
<p>the policies of the company on the other. It heard William T.
</p>
<p>Howell, an old antimonopoly man who had voted against the sale
</p>
<p>of the railroad by the state back in 1846, call the Michigan Central
</p>
<p>"the curse of an insolent and overgrown monopoly on the people."
</p>
<p>It agreed unanimously that "the Central Rail Road [had] been
</p>
<p>using our laws and Government as a means of outrage, oppression
</p>
<p>and injustice." A course of action was advised for the future to
</p>
<p>keep an eye on the railroad, elect honest men to office, and work
</p>
<p>to build a branch road from Jackson to the Michigan Southern
</p>
<p>Railroad at Adrian in order to create competition. Another reso-
</p>
<p>lution called on the Southern Railroad to carry out its pledges to
</p>
<p>build this branch road and pledged the assembled citizens to "meet
</p>
<p>it frankly and half-way." Here was the voice of the men who were
</p>
<p>eager for a connection between Jackson and Adrian and hoped
</p>
<p>then to carry the line through to Grand Rapids as part of the
</p>
<p>Grand River Valley Railroad. These were the potential investors in
</p>
<p>new railroads in the interior of the state who found their efforts
</p>
<p>blocked by the monopoly sections of the special charter granted
</p>
<p>the Michigan Central Railroad. In closing, the meeting inscribed
</p>
<p>the name of the deceased leader on its banner and resolved that it
</p>
<p>would "ever cherish the memory of the virtues of our lamented
</p>
<p>friend and fellow-citizen, Abel F. Fitch, the victim of a foul con-
</p>
<p>spiracy of unjust oppression and cruel wrong." "^^
</p>
<p>The same issue of the Whig American Citizen which printed the
</p>
<p>detailed story of the mass meeting also contained a two-column
</p>
<p>discussion of the whole conflict of the farmers and the railroad,
</p>
<p>defending the prisoners and attacking the policies of the company
</p>
<p>and its local supporter, Wilbur F. Storey, publisher of the Demo-
</p>
<p>cratic Jackson Patriot. Editor De Land carefully explained his
</p>
<p>own position: he wished "to preserve the sovereignty of the State
</p>
<p>in the hands of the people and keep it from the grasp of foreign

</p>
<p>capitalists and their lickspittles"; he did not wage war against the
</p>
<p>company and its rights it had in fact greatly benefited the county
</p>
<p>and the state "but a war as lasting as life is waged against its
</p>
<p>despotism, as displayed by its agents." Broadening his attack, De
</p>
<p>[81 ]
</p>
<p>Land called the railroad monopoly a "locofoco bantling" which
</p>
<p>received its special charter from a Democratic legislature and which
</p>
<p>subsequent Democratic legislatures had "tinkered up ... to suit
</p>
<p>Boston capitalists and remove them from the reach of the people."
</p>
<p>The corporation in return had given the Democrats funds and
</p>
<p>votes which enabled them to continue in office. ^^
</p>
<p>The shift in opinion even brought defection in the ranks of the
</p>
<p>prosecution. Jacob M. Howard, the Whig politician who had been
</p>
<p>hired by the company to assist in the prosecution, became con-
</p>
<p>vinced that he had made a mistake in taking the case and withdrew
</p>
<p>from all active participation in the trial, explaining that he no
</p>
<p>longer believed Henry Phelps was telling the truth.^o
</p>
<p>The railroad and its supporters began to fight back. The Demo-
</p>
<p>cratic organ, the Free Press, and the old-line Whig Advertiser, in a
</p>
<p>nonpartisan spirit, continued their attacks on the defendants and
</p>
<p>their counsel in defense of the Michigan Central and the interests
</p>
<p>of the city of Detroit. The company itself tried to curry whatever
</p>
<p>favor it might by placing a special train at the disposal of the court
</p>
<p>for a visit to the scenes of the alleged crimes. The train carried the
</p>
<p>party of judge, jury, and lawyers all the way to Marshall where
</p>
<p>they were dined and lodged overnight at the company's expense.
</p>
<p>Largesse was extended to the point of cajolery by offering free rides
</p>
<p>on the cars to anyone who lived between Jackson and Detroit to
</p>
<p>come and hear the closing arguments of counsel. One of the eastern
</p>
<p>directors of the company resorted to threats while on a visit to
</p>
<p>Detroit. He reportedly said: "These prisoners must be convicted
</p>
<p>and unless they are, there is over ^7,000,000 of property rendered
</p>
<p>worthless. If they are not convicted, I will sell my stock for what
</p>
<p>I can get, for it will not be worth a cent in two years." This in-
</p>
<p>judicious outburst, if true, was calculated to coerce the public into
</p>
<p>demanding a conviction, and certainly did not reflect the realities
</p>
<p>of the railroad's situation.^i
</p>
<p>This battle for public opinion was carried over into the lawyers'
</p>
<p>final arguments to the jury. For two full weeks, the big oratorical
</p>
<p>guns boomed away at the judge, jury, and each other, and at the

<p>public within and without the courtroom. To accommodate the
</p>
<p>large audiences of nearly a thousand who came to revel in the fes-
</p>
<p>tival of oratory, the sessions of court were held in the great hall on
</p>
<p>the third floor of the new Fireman's Hall. Here, Stuart, Van
</p>
<p>[82 ]
</p>
<p>Arman, and Van Dyke summed up the case for the state and refuted
</p>
<p>the arguments of the defense, while Frink, Hewitt, William A.
</p>
<p>Howard, and Seward sought to destroy that case and establish the
</p>
<p>innocence of their clients by pinning the crime of conspiracy on
</p>
<p>the prosecution's chief witnesses, Phelps, Lake, and Wescott. Van
</p>
<p>Arman spoke for two-and-a-half days, hammering and slashing
</p>
<p>away at the defendants with vicious invective and pulling all the
</p>
<p>stops in his maudlin appeals to the jury. Seward replied for three
</p>
<p>days in a masterful harangue compounded of logic, learning, melo-
</p>
<p>drama, and cutting sarcasm, which even the hostile Free Press
</p>
<p>found uncommon, though it sneered at the speech as a mixture of
</p>
<p>"appropriate quantities of the dough, the sugar and the spices."
</p>
<p>Van Dyke met the challenge admirably and more than matched
</p>
<p>Seward's forensics. Tall, dignified, elegant, this "Chesterfield of the
</p>
<p>Michigan Bar," made the final plea for the state, suavely and skill-
</p>
<p>fully demanding a conviction on the highest moral and patriotic
</p>
<p>grounds. The other lawyers delivered addresses of lesser length and
</p>
<p>force, and by September 25 the case was ready to go to the jury.82
</p>
<p>Almost as much as on the merits of their respective cases, counsel
</p>
<p>dwelt on those issues and charges which were agitating the public.
</p>
<p>Echoes of the excitement of the early days of the trial, of anti-
</p>
<p>corporation sentiment, of the death of Fitch, and of the resurgence
</p>
<p>of sympathy for the defendants bounded around the walls of the
</p>
<p>crowded courtroom. Now it was the defense which conjured up the
</p>
<p>ogre of an omnipotent monopoly, which had whipped the public
</p>
<p>into a lather of vengeful delirium and was intent on crushing
</p>
<p>valiant, humble citizens fighting only for their rights under the law.
</p>
<p>And it was the prosecution that counseled the members of the jury
</p>
<p>to mistrust and ignore that fickle guide, public opinion, and follow
</p>
<p>only their consciences. Van Dyke admitted innocently that right
</p>
<p>after the arrests for an atrocious crime that almost burnt the whole
</p>
<p>city to the ground, "it was natural that for a time, the public pulse
</p>
<p>should beat the quicker," and then rhetorically flung the charge of
</p>
<p>arousing the public back at the defense:
</p>
<p>Have the prosecuting counsel run through the streets pledging their

</p>
<p>honors to the innocence or guilt of the prisoners? Have they sought, day
</p>
<p>after day, to raise an influence that might be brought to bear on your
</p>
<p>deliberations? Have they sown distrust broadcast in the community, or
</p>
<p>gathered public meetings for the purpose of denouncing these judicial
</p>
<p>[83]
</p>
<p>proceedings? Have they got up deathbed scenes . . .? Have they pub-
</p>
<p>lished sermons of doubtful morality and perverted taste, for distribu-
</p>
<p>tion . . . ? Have they passed through the streets, stating that they knew,
</p>
<p>and could v^^ager, that certain of the jury they might name, would never
</p>
<p>agree to convict?
</p>
<p>The lawyers for the defense accused the state of hasty circumven-
</p>
<p>tions of the law and of virtually depriving their clients of the right
</p>
<p>to bail, of using spies with criminal records to collect evidence. To
</p>
<p>these charges, Van Arman and Van Dyke replied that the trial had
</p>
<p>been a free and fair one, according to law, such as the defendants
</p>
<p>could not have had anywhere else in the world. As for bail, it was
</p>
<p>the court that had fixed the amount, not the prosecution. It was,
</p>
<p>furthermore, by no means excessive, considering the enormity of
</p>
<p>the crime. If the bail had been any less, these dangerous criminals
</p>
<p>would have been set free to continue their attacks on life and prop-
</p>
<p>erty. "Would you have sent your wife and family upon that [rail-]
</p>
<p>road," Van Arman asked the jury, "with these men at large?" And
</p>
<p>in using spies of shady backgrounds, the company had only fought
</p>
<p>fire with fire; their work had been necessary and useful and hence
</p>
<p>honorable. Besides, who were these men who now appealed for
</p>
<p>their rights at law? "Have not these men for two years been in open
</p>
<p>and avowed rebellion against all law . . ., trampled upon all legal,
</p>
<p>social and moral obligations and become and proclaimed them-
</p>
<p>selves most openly, mere pirates, outlaws, robbers and murderers?"
</p>
<p>By their crimes, have they not forfeited "all protection and con-
</p>
<p>sideration from their fellow citizens?"
</p>
<p>Counsel for the people went on in this vein, thoroughly to black-
</p>
<p>guard the prisoners in the dock. Seward had pictured his clients
</p>
<p>as simple, honest farmers and mechanics, "pioneers of the State,"
</p>
<p>poor struggling settlers in a new land, in the rural hamlet of Leoni,
</p>
<p>who were seeking justice at the hands of powerful wealth. The
</p>
<p>prosecution lawyers dismissed this idyllic portrait as ridiculous.
</p>
<p>These men were an organized group of reckless and depraved
</p>
<p>felons who would stop at nothing to gain their ill-conceived ends.
</p>
<p>"Rural hamlet, indeed," Van Dyke sneered. Leoni was a benighted

</p>
<p>sink of iniquity which had steadily been declining in population.
</p>
<p>It was not strange that its people were ready to burn and kill. Van
</p>
<p>Dyke explained:
</p>
<p>There is no accounting for the actions of men who begin by believing
</p>
<p>[84]
</p>
<p>in the utter corruption of all who surround them, even of those whose
</p>
<p>virtue and wisdom have placed them to preside over the most sacred
</p>
<p>institutions; and who end by adopting vengeance as their guiding star,
</p>
<p>and hugging that hideous passion to their heart. They become blind to
</p>
<p>reason, justice and humanity. Every feeling turns to morbid hatred;
</p>
<p>every pulse throbs with bitter passion, and innocent and guilty are alike
</p>
<p>sacrificed to minister to an insatiate appetite for revenge.
</p>
<p>Some of the defendants had died, but, ah, sighed Van Dyke, he
</p>
<p>could not but wish "that while yet in their childhood they had
</p>
<p>sank sweetly into their last repose, long before vice and crime
</p>
<p>stained their youth and subjected their manhood to this ordeal
</p>
<p>at the bar of their offended country." Nothing was sacred to them,
</p>
<p>shouted Van Arman, "not even the holy Sabbath. Look at their
</p>
<p>moral character, playing cards, gambling, drinking and carousing
</p>
<p>Sabbath after Sabbath. Listen to their horrid oaths their blas-
</p>
<p>phemies. . . Is not crime the natural and appropriate sequel of such
</p>
<p>a history?" Not merely the actual crimes of the defendants, but all
</p>
<p>the possible horrors of their actions were spelled out for the jury
</p>
<p>in fascinating detail verging on bathos. The Leoni villains had
</p>
<p>once obstructed the tracks, meaning to throw off a scheduled pas-
</p>
<p>senger train into the Dry Marsh, but by chance a freight train
</p>
<p>had been stopped. Van Arman would not, however, let the occasion
</p>
<p>slip by; he wrung every drop of sentiment from it.
</p>
<p>Little did the thoughtless and merry company who left your city on
</p>
<p>that bright summer day . . . dream of the deadly perils which beset their
</p>
<p>path. Little did the admiring traveler deem, as he gazed upon the smiling
</p>
<p>landscapes . . . that such a land could harbor the bloody assassin that
</p>
<p>beneath the shade of those sunny groves crept, with stealthy tread, the
</p>
<p>murderer, against whose wiles and snares the arm of the law was power-
</p>
<p>less to protect his life. Little deemed the mother, as she fondly played
</p>
<p>with infant slumbering upon her breast, that its winding sheet, and hers,
</p>
<p>was prepared in the cold bosom of that sunless and dismal lake! And
</p>
<p>yet it was for them for that fated train, thus heavily laden with human
</p>
<p>beings, that the fatal toils were set. In the silent depths of those stag-
</p>
<p>nant waters, where the blessed light of heaven could never smile upon

</p>
<p>them, their grave was dug.
</p>
<p>Van Dyke was not to be outdone by his colleague. He too dwelt
</p>
<p>tearfully on the catastrophe that had been averted. "Fancy," he
</p>
<p>begged the jury,
</p>
<p>fancy that doomed train approaching, with its precious freight fami-
</p>
<p>lies returning from long and painful absence visions of home and hap-
</p>
<p>[85]
</p>
<p>piness flashing before them; on they rush unconscious of the fate
</p>
<p>prepared for them; there is a sudden stop one mighty bound of the
</p>
<p>engine one shrill whistle, one wild scream, and all is over. They are
</p>
<p>sunk, entombed not in the beautiful cemeteries where mourning friends
</p>
<p>may weep over their ashes not even in the bright clear waters of our
</p>
<p>lake; but amid the slime and mud that ages have accumulated in that
</p>
<p>dismal spot.
</p>
<p>The defense lawyers could not match these fanciful previsions of
</p>
<p>doom, but were not altogether inept at similar pathetic excursions.
</p>
<p>They did not hesitate to play up the death of Fitch for all it was
</p>
<p>worth, presenting him as a martyred hero, a victim of greed and
</p>
<p>cruelty. Frink perorated on the theme: "His life has been sacrificed
</p>
<p>in the midst of his days. God in his providence has permitted him
</p>
<p>to fall upon the altar of freedom a victim of injustice and oppres-
</p>
<p>sion." Fitch was a fine man, a gentleman, whose innocence counsel
</p>
<p>never doubted. And, Frink concluded, soberly prodding the jury,
</p>
<p>"a higher and holier tribunal has ere this judged him in mercy."
</p>
<p>Seward chimed in, in turn, "Death. . . has invested the transaction
</p>
<p>with the dignity of tragedy." In a voice husky with emotion and
</p>
<p>constant snuff-taking, and without showy oratorical grace, he de-
</p>
<p>livered his own peroration, which must have left the jury floun-
</p>
<p>dering in its own tears. "Fitch," he exclaimed,
</p>
<p>who was feared, hated and loved most of all, has fallen in the vigor of life
</p>
<p>"hacked down
</p>
<p>His thick summer leaves all faded!"
</p>
<p>When such an one falls, amid the din and smoke of the battlefield, our
</p>
<p>emotions are overpowered suppressed lost in the excitement of public
</p>
<p>passion. But when he perishes a victim of domestic or social strife when
</p>
<p>we see the iron enter his soul, and see it day by day, sinking deeper and
</p>
<p>deeper, until nature gives way and he lies lifeless at our feet then there
</p>
<p>is nothing to check the flow of forgiveness, compassion and sympathy.
</p>
<p>If in the moment when he is closing his eyes on earth, he declares, "I
</p>
<p>have committed no crime against my country, I die a martyr for the
</p>
<p>liberty of speech, and perish of a broken heart" then, indeed do we feel,
</p>
<p>that the tongues of dying men enforce attention, like deep harmony.

<p>Who would willingly consent to decide on the guilt or innocence of one
</p>
<p>who has thus been withdrawn from our erring judgment, to the tribunal
</p>
<p>of eternal justice? Yet it cannot be avoided. If Abel F. Fitch was guilty
</p>
<p>of the crime charged in this indictment, every man here may nevertheless
</p>
<p>be innocent; but if he was innocent, then there is not one of these, his
</p>
<p>associates in life, who can be guilty. Try him, then, since you must-
</p>
<p>condemn him, if you must and with him condemn them. But remember
</p>
<p>that you are mortal and he is now immortal; and that before that tribunal
</p>
<p>[86]
</p>
<p>where he stands, you must stand and confront, and vindicate your judg-
</p>
<p>ment. Remember, too, that he is now free. He has not only left behind
</p>
<p>him the dungeon, the cell and the chain; but he exults in a freedom,
</p>
<p>compared to which, the liberty we enjoy is slavery and bondage. You
</p>
<p>stand, then, between the dead and the living. . . You will, I am sure, be
</p>
<p>just to the living, and true to your country; because, under circumstances
</p>
<p>so solemn so full of awe you cannot be unjust to the dead, nor false to
</p>
<p>your country, nor to your God.^
</p>
<p>Van Dyke, immediately following Seward, could not let the ap-
</p>
<p>peal go unchallenged. He opened his address with ironic modesty:
</p>
<p>While I feel pleased in beholding the laurels which this trial has en-
</p>
<p>twined around other brows, I will seek to gather none for my own. I
</p>
<p>will neither wander into the paths of fancy, nor address myself to those
</p>
<p>who sit without the jury box. . . I shall not seek or hope to leave the
</p>
<p>impress of oratorical power upon your imagination. . . You must expect
</p>
<p>from me, gentlemen, no eloquent declamations. . . I will not weave a
</p>
<p>single wreath of fancy. . . I [shall] refrain from pursuing the meteoric
</p>
<p>fancies, eloquent philippics and sublime apostrophes. . .
</p>
<p>He then struck back at the defense's dramatic evocation of death
</p>
<p>and innocence. What had the deaths of some of the defendants to
</p>
<p>do with the case? Because two of them had died, was that any rea-
</p>
<p>son to infer the innocence of the remainder? "Permit me to ask you
</p>
<p>gentlemen what have you to do with death bed scenes false in
</p>
<p>fact, morbid in taste and wholly irrelevant to this issue." The death-
</p>
<p>bed drama was fiction. Fitch was without doubt delirious in his last
</p>
<p>moments. His dying words, "dressed up as they now are . . ., would
</p>
<p>meet from the deceased, could he hear them, no sign of recog-
</p>
<p>nition. . . They might serve to adorn a page of some yellow covered
</p>
<p>novel they have served to grace two elegant perorations," but
</p>
<p>were out of place here in a court of law.
</p>
<p>Even more reprehensible. Van Dyke thought, were the strictures
</p>
<p>on the railroad corporation delivered by his opponents. They had
</p>
<p>described the railroad company as a grasping monopoly that would
</p>
<p>brook no criticism or interference in its relentless pursuit of gain,
</p>
<p>that sought to dominate the state and the people with its power and

</p>
<p>crush all who opposed it. The trial, according to the defense, was
</p>
<p>no longer an issue between the state and the defendants, but as
</p>
<p>Frink put it, between Fitch and "the monetary power" of a corpora-
</p>
<p>tion with seven million dollars capital, "a power behind and above
</p>
<p>the government a power that is seldom regulated by humane and
</p>
<p>[87 ]
</p>
<p>just sentiments; that always seeks to crush those it cannot cajole. . ."
</p>
<p>Seward, though he had disclaimed hostility to corporations and
</p>
<p>support for illegal methods to fight them, had also dwelt on the
</p>
<p>abuse of the people by the Michigan Central. "Corporate wealth,"
</p>
<p>he had warned the jury,
</p>
<p>cannot long oppress the citizen in such a country and under such a gov-
</p>
<p>ernment as this. Your verdict against these defendants, if it shall appear
</p>
<p>to be well grounded upon the evidence, will abate a rapidly rising popu-
</p>
<p>lar commotion; but, if it shall not be so sustained by the evidence, a
</p>
<p>people which make the wrongs of each one the common cause of all, will
</p>
<p>pick strong matter of wrath out of the bloody finger ends of a successful
</p>
<p>conspiracy.
</p>
<p>At this. Van Dyke was shocked. He assailed such demagogic
</p>
<p>appeals to bend justice to popular clamor. He defended and lauded
</p>
<p>the corporation as a harbinger of endless prosperity and universal
</p>
<p>bliss. It was not true that strife had come into Michigan when the
</p>
<p>state sold the railroad to a corporation. It was, on the contrary, a
</p>
<p>"fortunate hour," for
</p>
<p>where heaven's light was once shut out by dense forests, it [now] shines
</p>
<p>over fertile fields and rich luxuriant harvests . . . ; hope and energy
</p>
<p>sprung from their lethargic sleep, labor clapped her glad hands and
</p>
<p>shouted for joy; and Michigan, bent for the moment like a sapling by
</p>
<p>the fierceness of a passing tempest, relieved from the debts and burthens,
</p>
<p>rose erect, and in her youthful strength, stood proudly up among her
</p>
<p>sister states. . . A detestable monopoly! These railroads built by united
</p>
<p>energies and capital are the great instruments in the hand of God to
</p>
<p>hasten onward the glorious mission of Religion and Civilization.
</p>
<p>Van Dyke sorely regretted that "the eminent counsel" had per-
</p>
<p>mitted his "energetic bile" to gush forth for "sinister purposes"
</p>
<p>and had talked about sacrificing citizens at the behest of dangerous
</p>
<p>monopolies. Worst of all, Seward had intimated that if the verdict
</p>
<p>were not satisfactory, the people would take things into their own
</p>
<p>hands. These were "poisoned and dangerous sentiments" ap-
</p>
<p>propriate not for a court of law in the state of Michigan but for
</p>
<p>some bloody Paris tribunal. "Ah, gentlemen," Van Dyke warned

<p>the jury, "there is a worse evil abroad through this land, than the
</p>
<p>overshadowing power of corporations. These are isms of dreadful
</p>
<p>and fearful import around us. They menace our public institutions
</p>
<p>and private rights. There is a spirit of disloyalty to law and coun-
</p>
<p>try." There are attacks on the revered traditions of our land in the
</p>
<p>[88]
</p>
<p>name of a "higher law," in which public clamor is placed above
</p>
<p>the law and the people are aroused to sit in judgment over courts
</p>
<p>and juries. This evil can lead only to the destruction of civili-
</p>
<p>zation. Beautiful, prosperous, peaceful Michigan it has come into
</p>
<p>being and flourished mightily under the aegis of the law. Disregard
</p>
<p>the law and you destroy all this. But enough! What he said surely
</p>
<p>did not apply to the law-loving citizens of Michigan, but rather
</p>
<p>to "some foreign district, some land where anti-rent and anti-law
</p>
<p>make part of her history," like Mr. Seward's state of New York.
</p>
<p>Finally, Van Dyke, like Van Arman, called for a conviction not
</p>
<p>merely on the intrinsic merits of the case but equally on its all-
</p>
<p>embracing importance. "This cause," he pointed out,
</p>
<p>has spread through the confines of our State and beyond its limits, and
</p>
<p>a world is looking on to see if there is here strength, and virtue sufficient
</p>
<p>to assert the integrity of the law. . . The dignity, the honor, and the
</p>
<p>character of Michigan are in your keeping. . . We are called upon by
</p>
<p>every high consideration to do our duty in this case . . . Gratitude for the
</p>
<p>lovely heritage God has given us; patriotism, love for the beautiful pen-
</p>
<p>insula, in which is fixed our destiny and centered our all of earthly good
</p>
<p>and hope ... all unite in one voice, and ask that you be firm, free and
</p>
<p>steadfast on this occasion. For if these dangerous doctrines which pro-
</p>
<p>duced the outrages we are considering, are to spread from the hamlet of
</p>
<p>Leoni, throughout the breadth of the land, and even to the jury box of
</p>
<p>our courts; if men animated by deep hate against a corporation, feel and
</p>
<p>think that they are justified in redressing their own real or fancied
</p>
<p>wrongs, in their own way; if courts are to be scouted at, laws to be
</p>
<p>trampled on, order rushed into wild confusion, and crime sympathized
</p>
<p>with and left to stalk unpunished; then indeed have evil days come upon
</p>
<p>us. Capital, virtue, peace and property will be trodden over, and crushed
</p>
<p>by mob violence and all the dire evils which will follow in its train. . .
</p>
<p>The first jury which renders a verdict, tainted by the unhallowed spirit
</p>
<p>of fear, or public opinion, or prejudiced by loud clamors against monopo-
</p>
<p>lies and tyrannical corporations, will have stricken a death blow at this
</p>
<p>country's honor and welfare.
</p>
<p>Van Dyke was confident, however, that Michigan would be "loyal

</p>
<p>to the Union and to the law."
</p>
<p>These solemn appeals for loyalty to God and country over-
</p>
<p>shadowed in large measure the summing up of the evidence. In
</p>
<p>elaborating the legal case against the defendants, the lawyers for
</p>
<p>the prosecution stressed the fact that they had been engaged in a
</p>
<p>conspiracy. The men of Leoni, it was clearly pointed out, hated the
</p>
<p>railroad, swore to get redress, obstructed the tracks and attacked
</p>
<p>[89]
</p>
<p>the trains, threatened to burn depots, met and discussed their
</p>
<p>plans, and took oaths of mutual loyalty: all of which was evidence
</p>
<p>enough that they were conspiring to destroy railroad property
</p>
<p>until their demands were met. It all raised more than a pre-
</p>
<p>sumption that they also burnt the depot in Detroit. The later at-
</p>
<p>tempt to burn the Niles depot was equally part of the over-all plan.
</p>
<p>True, each of the criminal acts against railroad property at or
</p>
<p>near Michigan Centre had not been brought home to a particular
</p>
<p>defendant. But it was not necessary to prove who committed each
</p>
<p>and every crime. If one act was proved against one man, the pre-
</p>
<p>sumption was that all were guilty of all the acts, unless proven
</p>
<p>innocent. All the defendants, moreover, need not have aided and
</p>
<p>abetted in each outrage nor even have been present. It was suf-
</p>
<p>ficient that they had been cognizant of the offense and consented
</p>
<p>to and approved of it. That was the essence of conspiracy or com-
</p>
<p>bination: the necessary elements of "unity of motive, purpose and
</p>
<p>design" were all present.
</p>
<p>As to the crime charged in the indictment, the burning of the
</p>
<p>depot, there was no doubt that the building had been destroyed by
</p>
<p>an incendiary. The place where the flames had first been seen by
</p>
<p>reliable witnesses, in the cupola, high above the elevating machin-
</p>
<p>ery and the storage bins, proved that the fire had not been an ac-
</p>
<p>cidental one. Too, the depot had been shut down at midnight and
</p>
<p>all the candles extinguished. In any case, Gay had admitted to
</p>
<p>Phelps that he had set the fire with a match. Experiments con-
</p>
<p>ducted by the chemist, Dr. Desnoyers, proved that the match would
</p>
<p>burn for several hours, as Gay said it had done. Van Arman had,
</p>
<p>nevertheless, to admit that it had not been proven beyond a shadow
</p>
<p>of a doubt that the depot fire had not been an accident, for, as
</p>
<p>he explained, "There never was a case of burning where the proof
</p>
<p>was certain that it did not take place by accident."
</p>
<p>Van Dyke and Van Arman then stoutly defended the veracity
</p>
<p>of Phelps and Wescott, their star witnesses. Of Phelps, Van Arman

<p>ern times, either the vilest and most abandoned wretch that Providence
</p>
<p>has ever permitted to pollute the earth ... or he is the most deeply
</p>
<p>wronged man on the face of the earth. If he has deceived us, there is no
</p>
<p>penalty too heavy for his crime.
</p>
<p>[90]
</p>
<p>But he could not have possibly deceived all the counsel for the
</p>
<p>state as well as Superintendent Brooks and Mr. Clark. "You must
</p>
<p>see," Van Arman argued, "that we all have fully believed [him] or
</p>
<p>we had not dared to commence these proceedings." The prose-
</p>
<p>cution had not, moreover, accepted Phelps' testimony, crucial as
</p>
<p>it was, without corroboration. Clark and Van Arman had con-
</p>
<p>firmed Gay's confessions, and an independent witness had been
</p>
<p>present when Phelps had been "fixed out" for burning the Niles
</p>
<p>Depot at Michigan Centre the night of April ii, 1851. Nor had
</p>
<p>Phelps' testimony, or Wescott's, been shaken on cross-examination.
</p>
<p>Both of their stories were so long and so complicated, they could
</p>
<p>not have possibly been fabricated, and the defense's attempts to
</p>
<p>contradict them had utterly failed. On the contrary, it was the de-
</p>
<p>fense witnesses who were tainted with perjury. Van Arman pointed
</p>
<p>out that Hawley himself had confessed to that crime, and added,
</p>
<p>"It would be rashness after the experience we have had of the skill
</p>
<p>and resources of these defendants to doubt for a moment that they
</p>
<p>could prove anything they wish." The charge that Phelps, Lake,
</p>
<p>and Wescott had themselves conspired to pin the crime on Fitch
</p>
<p>and company was equally baseless. They had no cause to injure
</p>
<p>Fitch; they were indeed his friends and accepted as such until
</p>
<p>exposed as railroad agents. Phelps and Wescott could not have
</p>
<p>schemed together, for they had not been acquainted until after they
</p>
<p>had made their separate reports to Clark, who had not let one see
</p>
<p>the other's reports. Phelps and Lake could not have made the
</p>
<p>matches: they had not seen one until Fitch had shown them one.
</p>
<p>The log of whitewood had probably been planted on Phelps' va-
</p>
<p>cated premises, for whatever he was, Phelps was no fool who would
</p>
<p>have left it there to be found and used as evidence against him.
</p>
<p>It was the defendants who had conspired, prosecution counsel
</p>
<p>contended, to destroy the property of the railroad and who had
</p>
<p>hired Gay to burn the depot in Detroit. There was no doubt that
</p>
<p>Fitch knew Gay and had negotiated with him in the summer of
</p>
<p>1849. Had not Gay mentioned his name and that of others at the
</p>
<p>Centre? Aaron Mount, one of the defendants, had, according to

<p>Lake, admitted being associated with Gay in crime and had brought
</p>
<p>Fitch and Gay together. Too, Wescott had testified that he had
</p>
<p>followed Fitch to Gay's house in Detroit and seen him enter it.
</p>
<p>On this point, the prosecution made much of the testimony of
</p>
<p>[91 ]
</p>
<p>Dr. James A. Hahn, mayor of Marshall, who had been on the train
</p>
<p>that had brought the prisoners to Detroit. According to Dr. Hahn,
</p>
<p>Fitch had asked to see the warrant for his arrest. As he read it, he
</p>
<p>said that he had a slight acquaintance with Phelps some years be-
</p>
<p>fore the latter had gone to prison but since then had had little to do
</p>
<p>with him. Fitch had then added that he saw that he was charged
</p>
<p>with being an accomplice of a certain Mr. Gay, but that he did
</p>
<p>not know Gay and had never heard of him. And then, after a pause,
</p>
<p>he said, "I believe that old Gay has turned state's evidence." This
</p>
<p>last remark. Van Dyke insisted, unquestionably proved that the
</p>
<p>squire of Michigan Centre knew the bawdy-house keeper of
</p>
<p>Detroit; otherwise, why should Fitch call him "old Gay," and
</p>
<p>what state's evidence was there to turn.
</p>
<p>In concluding his argument. Van Dyke briefly reviewed the evi-
</p>
<p>dence against each of the thirty-two defendants. Against seventeen
</p>
<p>of them, he admitted that, thoua:h there was evidence to show that
</p>
<p>they were involved in the general conspiracy to destroy railroad
</p>
<p>property, there was none implicating them in the crime of burning
</p>
<p>the depot. He said he would be satisfied if the jury acquitted these
</p>
<p>and told them "to go and sin no more." Against three of the de-
</p>
<p>fendants, the evidence was doubtful, and the jury would have to
</p>
<p>consider their cases carefully and then decide as it saw fit. Against
</p>
<p>twelve of them, whom he named, he had no doubt that the evi-
</p>
<p>dence was strong and true that they were clearly guilty of being
</p>
<p>accomplices before the fact. For these, he demanded a conviction,
</p>
<p>so that history might record the fact that "a firm and able judge,
</p>
<p>an intelligent and honest jury, unawed by fear and prejudice, and
</p>
<p>unawed by threats, vindicated the violated law."
</p>
<p>In their closing arguments, Frink and Seward denied completely
</p>
<p>the guilt of their clients and tried to prove that there was no basis
</p>
<p>in fact or in law for the case against them. The charge of con-
</p>
<p>spiracy was false and even ludicrous. The criminal acts against
</p>
<p>railroad property in Jackson County had indeed and unfortunately
</p>
<p>been committed, but they were "individual, casual, unpremed-
</p>
<p>itated crimes," in which it was proven that only three or four of

</p>
<p>the defendants had been involved and only those present had been
</p>
<p>implicated. The expressions of hostility had been legitimate indivi-
</p>
<p>dual opinions, and the threats uttered, "individual, impulsive,
</p>
<p>passionate, but idle." All the meetings cited as evidence of a con-
</p>
<p>[92 ]
</p>
<p>spiracy had been accidental, not preconcerted, irregularly and
</p>
<p>openly held in the public barroom, "open to all comers, whether
</p>
<p>village gossips or travelers." All the criminal acts and gatherings
</p>
<p>had, moreover, taken place in Jackson County, in another juris-
</p>
<p>diction, and were no concern of the jury in Wayne County. In vain
</p>
<p>the defense had opposed the admission of such testimony on the
</p>
<p>ground that those crimes, even if committed by the defendants,
</p>
<p>could not be proven under the present indictment; that if the de-
</p>
<p>fendants did or did not burn the depot, it mattered not whether
</p>
<p>they conspired to do so. The prosecution had offered this mass of
</p>
<p>evidence, promising to prove a conspiracy to destroy all the prop-
</p>
<p>erty of the railroad, including the depot. This they had not done.
</p>
<p>They had succeeded, however, Frink charged, in their design "to
</p>
<p>subserve the same unholy purpose of the declarations, made not
</p>
<p>only in the streets, and in public journals, but in the presence of
</p>
<p>this court, denouncing in advance, as outlaws, and as their per-
</p>
<p>jured abettors, every man who should be a witness for, the de-
</p>
<p>fendants."
</p>
<p>Seward then attacked Wescott and his testimony, on which the
</p>
<p>charge of conspiracy was largely based. Wescott, Seward charged,
</p>
<p>who had told of the alleged declarations made to him by the de-
</p>
<p>fendants and to him alone, in the presence of no one else, was noth-
</p>
<p>ing but a "hireling informer," of dubious repute, a coward, with a
</p>
<p>grudge against Fitch. He had been contradicted in many parts of
</p>
<p>his story. Most of the remarks he attributed to the defendants
</p>
<p>showed nothing more than hostility to the railroad. Wescott tried
</p>
<p>to supply this deficiency by adding that Fitch, Filley, and Corwin
</p>
<p>had called themselves "The Leoni Band"; that Filley had angrily
</p>
<p>declared, "Leoni against the world"; that other Leonians had said
</p>
<p>to him that they were banded together for the destruction of the
</p>
<p>road unless they were paid for their cattle. Seward pointedly asked:
</p>
<p>Do you not see how admirably this testimony is adapted to the exigen-
</p>
<p>cies of the prosecution? I imagine I hear the counsel. Van Arman, say,
</p>
<p>wanted proof of a conspiracy. Wescott: They called themselves the
</p>
<p>Leoni Band. . . Van Arman: Wanted proof that the band was banded

<p>together. Wescott: Fitch said we are banded and conspired together
</p>
<p>against the railroad company. Van Arman: Wanted proof that the ob-
</p>
<p>ject of the conspiracy was the destruction of the railroad. Wescott: Fitch
</p>
<p>said, we are banded and conspired together for the entire destruction of
</p>
<p>the railroad. . . .
</p>
<p>[93 ]
</p>
<p>Seward then reduced to absurdity the whole notion of a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy:
</p>
<p>What a solemn and fearful scene that must have been when these
</p>
<p>conspirators threw off the mask "Leoni against the world." Where and
</p>
<p>what was this Leoni? It was a hamlet among the oak openings of Mich-
</p>
<p>igan. What was its magnitude? It consisted of a country tavern, a store
</p>
<p>house, a school-house, a church, a dozen humble tenements. Who were
</p>
<p>the members of this band? One country gentleman, one keeper of a
</p>
<p>tavern and ball-alley, one drinking teamster, one backwoodsman, and one
</p>
<p>village mason; and they acted their parts with as much boldness, and
</p>
<p>even more, than the clowns in the interlude in Midsummer Night's
</p>
<p>Dream. For when Bottom proposed to act the part of Lion, he was over-
</p>
<p>ruled lest he might roar too loudly, and so "frighten the duchesses and
</p>
<p>the ladies." No such timidity distinguished the clowns of Leoni. They
</p>
<p>proclaimed themselves the unterrified "Leoni against the world."
</p>
<p>With this, he mockingly dismissed the witness: "Adieu, Mr.
</p>
<p>William D. Wescott."
</p>
<p>Coming closer to the heart of the case, Seward blasted the evi-
</p>
<p>dence purporting to connect the defendants with Gay in the burn-
</p>
<p>ing of the depot. In the first place, at least nineteen of the defend-
</p>
<p>ants had not been shown to have had any connection with Gay.
</p>
<p>Against the rest, there were only the reported admissions by Gay
</p>
<p>and the defendants themselves, "the most uncertain and unsat-
</p>
<p>isfactory of all testimony," because it consisted of mere repetition
</p>
<p>of oral statements of others, liable to be misunderstood or in-
</p>
<p>correctly heard or reported. All the alleged declarations and admis-
</p>
<p>sions, Seward insinuated, bore the mark of falsehood, for they were
</p>
<p>all couched in the language of the witnesses who reported them.
</p>
<p>It reminded one of the "Grecian oracles" or the "Rochester rap-
</p>
<p>pings," where the ghosts "were learned in the languages of the
</p>
<p>conjurors."
</p>
<p>Such admissions, moreover, meant nothing in the face of the
</p>
<p>fact that the crime could not have been committed in the manner
</p>
<p>supposedly confessed. The match as described by Phelps would
</p>
<p>not burn. It could not have burst into flame several hours after it

</p>
<p>had been lighted in Gay's house and then carried through the
</p>
<p>streets in a covered box. Even if it had, Gay could not have de-
</p>
<p>posited it unseen in the cupola at 7 or 8 p.m., as he reportedly
</p>
<p>said he did, with the guards and employees busy all about the
</p>
<p>depot. Why had no one seen Gay? Why had the prosecution not
</p>
<p>[94]
</p>
<p>brought Gay's wife to testify that he had left his home with the
</p>
<p>match that evening? Why had they spirited her away? Nor had
</p>
<p>it been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the fire had been
</p>
<p>incendiary and not accidental. Even if it had first been seen in the
</p>
<p>cupola, as the prosecution contended, that still did not prove it
</p>
<p>had not been accidental.
</p>
<p>More important, Seward continued, it had not been incontro-
</p>
<p>vertibly established that any of the defendants actually knew Gay.
</p>
<p>Fitch had not been in Detroit in the summer of 1849. Wescott's
</p>
<p>testimony that he had followed Fitch to Gay's house early in 1851
</p>
<p>had been contradicted by witnesses who had been in Fitch's com-
</p>
<p>pany all the time he was in the city. The meeting Wescott referred
</p>
<p>to had, in any case, taken place after the fire. As for Dr. Hahn's
</p>
<p>testimony about Fitch's remarks on the train after the arrests. Fitch
</p>
<p>certainly was truthful in denying all knowledge of Gay before the
</p>
<p>arrests. After the arrests and after he had read the warrant, "old
</p>
<p>Gay's" name must have become as "familiar as household words."
</p>
<p>No evidence had been brought to show that Fitch had ever nego-
</p>
<p>tiated with Gay to undertake the crime. When and where had this
</p>
<p>been done? Fitch was dogged by spies and certainly any meeting be-
</p>
<p>t\veen him and Gay would not have remained unknown. Ab-
</p>
<p>solutely no proof had been offered that any of the defendants had
</p>
<p>made the match and then delivered it to Gay, or that any payment
</p>
<p>had ever been made for the crime. Had all this been done by mes-
</p>
<p>senger or correspondence? Why had not Phelps testified to any
</p>
<p>of these crucial transactions? Why had not the defendants revealed
</p>
<p>these important matters to Phelps and the other spies as they had
</p>
<p>the other details of their crime?
</p>
<p>The charge that the defendants had hired Gay to burn the depot
</p>
<p>rested entirely on admissions, that is, on what Phelps and Lake said
</p>
<p>Gay and Fitch and others had told them. And Phelps and Lake
</p>
<p>and Gay were utterly unworthy of credit. Gay, Seward specified, was
</p>
<p>a man . . . who had been convicted of more than twenty crimes, ranging
</p>
<p>from petit larceny to murder . . ., a man who lived in daily association
</p>
<p>with culprits, and who at the time kept a house of ill-fame, and thus

</p>
<p>subsisted by the debasement of one sex, while he harbored the most
</p>
<p>depraved of the other.
</p>
<p>His purported admissions as to the complicity of the defendants in
</p>
<p>the crime, moreover, were not admissible as evidence. Gay was
</p>
<p>[95 ]
</p>
<p>dead and no longer on trial. As a principal, his admissions could
</p>
<p>not be evidence against his accessories until he himself had first
</p>
<p>been convicted. Hence, Frink argued, the whole trial had been
</p>
<p>invalidated on the technical ground that Gay had not been found
</p>
<p>guilty and the indictment of accessories alone must charge the
</p>
<p>ofEense in substantive language and not in a dependent manner.
</p>
<p>Seward did not go along with his colleague in charging a mistrial.
</p>
<p>He merely contended that the testimony of Gay's declarations had
</p>
<p>been allowed to come in unadvisedly, on a promise by the prose-
</p>
<p>cution that had not been kept, and should therefore now be
</p>
<p>stricken from the record.
</p>
<p>As for Phelps and Lake, both were convicted criminals. Phelps
</p>
<p>had, in addition, been impeached by over a hundred witnesses.
</p>
<p>The witnesses brought by the prosecution to uphold his reputation
</p>
<p>had not destroyed that impeachment. Some of them knew nothing
</p>
<p>of Phelps' character after 1842, and all of them without exception,
</p>
<p>when testifying favorably as to his reputation, had declared "not
</p>
<p>that they [had] heard it discussed and then pronounced good, but
</p>
<p>simply that they [had] not heard it discussed at all . . ." And by the
</p>
<p>very neighbors who had come into court and said that his character
</p>
<p>and reputation were bad!
</p>
<p>"I ask you now to consider," Seward reminded the jury,
</p>
<p>the circumstances under which [Phelps] appears. He testifies under the
</p>
<p>impulse of an overpowering necessity. A stipend of $40 a month as an
</p>
<p>informer is his only resource for support. . . His fortune involves two
</p>
<p>alternatives; one that he carry the prosecution through and cause these
</p>
<p>defendants to be sent to the State Prison and thus establish a claim to
</p>
<p>be restored to that social confidence which he so early lost; the other that
</p>
<p>he shall be convicted of wilful and malicious conspiracy against these
</p>
<p>defendants with perjury and subornation of perjury, and return, after a
</p>
<p>guilty respite of two years and six months to the State Prison whence he
</p>
<p>came.
</p>
<p>Phelps was motivated, besides, by an "impulse of a studiously con-
</p>
<p>cealed but malevolent and persevering revenge against Abel F.
</p>
<p>Fitch, who was originally the chief mark of this fearful prosecu-

</p>
<p>tion . . ." Vehemently, Seward dismissed the state's star witness:
</p>
<p>"Enough then for Henry Phelps. 'Room for the leper! Room!' "
</p>
<p>Phelps' testimony, Seward also pointed out, had been contra-
</p>
<p>dicted again and again in its circumstantial details by many wit-
</p>
<p>nesses. He had testified to appointed meetings with Fitch in Mich-
</p>
<p>[96 ]
</p>
<p>igan Centre and in Detroit, in which the latter had allegedly talked
</p>
<p>of his great success in burning the depot, and asked Phelps to burn
</p>
<p>the Niles depot and engage in counterfeiting. Witnesses, however,
</p>
<p>had merely heard Phelps and Fitch converse about such common-
</p>
<p>place subjects, as Fitch's twin oxen or where fish and provisions
</p>
<p>could be bought in Detroit. The imputation was clear that Phelps
</p>
<p>had simulated a close acquaintance with Fitch under various
</p>
<p>pretexts, reporting the while a farrago of incriminating admissions,
</p>
<p>of which the witnesses had heard nothing. There was, too, a sus-
</p>
<p>picious identity in the language of the admissions reported by
</p>
<p>Phelps and Lake, an identity "as harmonious as in the ritual of a
</p>
<p>Free Mason's Lodge or in the liturgy of the Episcopal Church," and
</p>
<p>which smacked of their sinister purpose and falsity.
</p>
<p>The whole case, the defense reiterated in conclusion, was a false
</p>
<p>and diabolical conspiracy by Phelps and his accomplices. The
</p>
<p>motives of the conspirators were hatred of Fitch and the hope of
</p>
<p>sharing the large reward offered by the railroad company. To this
</p>
<p>end, the three testified falsely that Fitch and the others from Leoni
</p>
<p>had admitted hiring Gay to burn the depot. Phelps and Lake had
</p>
<p>made the matches themselves and pretended to have received them
</p>
<p>from Fitch. They had brought a match themselves to Michigan
</p>
<p>Centre the day they left to burn the Niles depot. They had given
</p>
<p>a match to Gay so that Clark and Van Arman could see it in his
</p>
<p>possession. Phelps had induced Gay to admit that he had burned
</p>
<p>the depot, and the latter was precisely the kind to confess to a crime
</p>
<p>on the promise of immunity and a share of the reward. Or Gay had
</p>
<p>perhaps been duped by Phelps and had been arrested to keep him
</p>
<p>from testifying. The conversations between Gay and Phelps, re-
</p>
<p>ported on the witness stand by the latter, showed that some such
</p>
<p>conspiracy had been in the minds of the two. Phelps had testified
</p>
<p>that he had met Gay in Detroit in the Palo Alto saloon shortly after
</p>
<p>the depot fire. The two had discussed a scheme to free a mutual
</p>
<p>friend who was in jail for counterfeiting. They were to burn the
</p>
<p>railroad depot, get witnesses to swear the crime on some third per-
</p>
<p>son they disliked, and then have their friend in jail inform against

</p>
<p>the hapless victim. Their friend would as a result be freed and
</p>
<p>all three would share the reward received from the railroad com-
</p>
<p>pany. Phelps had then suggested that the plot to free their friend
</p>
<p>be based on the fire that had already taken place rather than on
</p>
<p>[97 ]
</p>
<p>some future one. These conversations, Phelps had revealed in
</p>
<p>court, had gone on over a period of weeks, and it was in the course
</p>
<p>of them that Gay had admitted that he burnt the old depot.
</p>
<p>"What," Seward asked after repeating Phelps' story, "what are all
</p>
<p>the pretended admissions of Gay and Fitch now produced here but
</p>
<p>the fabrications thus early foreshadowed?"
</p>
<p>Seward then referred to Prosecuting Attorney Stuart's plea that
</p>
<p>Erastus Smith be acquitted, as further proof of the existence of a
</p>
<p>conspiracy. Smith was one of the defendants, a Detroit friend of
</p>
<p>Gay's, who, according to Phelps, had admitted knowing of the plan
</p>
<p>to burn the depot and receiving part of the $150 Fitch had paid
</p>
<p>for the crime. Now, Stuart in his closing argument had asked for
</p>
<p>the acquittal of Smith on the grounds that he had been seduced by
</p>
<p>Phelps into falsely admitting his complicity in a crime of which
</p>
<p>he had no knowledge. "When I heard [Stuart] submit this extra-
</p>
<p>ordinary proposition," Seward triumphantly declared,
</p>
<p>I thanked God and took courage. It revealed the secret of this entire
</p>
<p>prosecution. It showed that Smith had been fraudulently made a defend-
</p>
<p>ant that he might utter without oath, false allegations to convict the
</p>
<p>defendants at Michigan Centre, under an assurance that he should be
</p>
<p>acquitted himself. And now, gentlemen, since Smith's allegations are
</p>
<p>admitted to be false, are Gay's averments, made under the same circum-
</p>
<p>stances, true? ... If Smith was seduced so easily by Phelps, Gay had
</p>
<p>even less virtue to resist his seduction. I declare, gentlemen, my profound
</p>
<p>conviction that the whole prosecution was conceived in fraud; that George
</p>
<p>W. Gay never burned the depot; that he and Smith falsely accused them-
</p>
<p>selves of that crime under a promise from Phelps to share in the reward
</p>
<p>of a conviction of the defendants . . . ; and that Gay, if he had lived to
</p>

<p>Smith's conviction along with the rest.
</p>
<p>After the counsel had concluded their arguments. Judge Wing
</p>
<p>delivered his charge to the jury. He reviewed the history of the
</p>
<p>case, but forebore to summarize the evidence, referring the jury
</p>
<p>to the printed transcript that was made available to them. He
</p>
<p>[98 ]
</p>
<p>lectured them with all the usual admonitions to impartiality and
</p>
<p>spelled out the usual legal precepts that were to guide them. On
</p>
<p>the technical questions raised by counsel in the course of the trial,
</p>
<p>he ruled against the defense. He admitted that, in law, Gay's de-
</p>
<p>clarations were evidence neither of his guilt or that of his ac-
</p>
<p>complices. The defense had erred, however, in waiting too long to
</p>
<p>object to them and it was now too late to strike them out. Pre-
</p>
<p>sumably, the defense should have objected when the declarations
</p>
<p>had been first introduced in evidence after Gay's death. The testi-
</p>
<p>mony of \Volliver and other railroad spies who were clearly ac-
</p>
<p>complices in some of the crimes committed in Jackson County was
</p>
<p>valid, because they had dissociated themselves from the defendants
</p>
<p>some time before the arrests. As to the impeachment of Phelps,
</p>
<p>Judge Wing told the jury that any evidence of his reputation for
</p>
<p>truth based on what was said of his testimony at the trial was not
</p>
<p>admissible. Further, if some witnesses said they had not heard
</p>
<p>Phelps' reputation discussed at all, nothing could more clearly
</p>
<p>uphold and establish it. Finally, the judge warned the jury to
</p>
<p>ignore the counsel's appeals to their emotions. If the Michigan
</p>
<p>Central Railroad were indeed a monopoly buying up judges and
</p>
<p>juries, that fact ought to have nothing to do with the decision in
</p>
<p>this case. "Large interests are dependent on your verdict," Wing
</p>
<p>reminded the jury, only to ask them to dimiss that consideration
</p>
<p>from their minds. He emphasized that no thought of the conse-
</p>
<p>quences must be allowed to influence their verdict, which must be
</p>
<p>one they could reasonably arrive at on the basis of the evidence
</p>
<p>and not one of whose truth they would have to swear.
</p>
<p>On September 25, at 11:30 a.m., the case went to the jury. The
</p>
<p>jurors, according to one report, started their deliberations with
</p>
<p>prayer, at the suggestion of one of their number who found himself
</p>
<p>bewildered by the impenetrable jungle of conflicting evidence
</p>
<p>and dismayed by the importance of the case. That evening, more
</p>
<p>than nine hours later, the jury returned with a verdict. It found
</p>
<p>twelve of the defendants guilty as charged and exonerated the re-
</p>
<p>maining twenty, recommending two of the guilty ones, Erastus

<p>Smith and Dr. Ebenezer Farnham, to the mercy of the court. The
</p>
<p>next morning, the prisoners, surrounded by their families, were
</p>
<p>brought into court to be sentenced. Their lawyers, in a last-ditch
</p>
<p>maneuver, moved for a new trial and for suspension of sentence
</p>
<p>[99]
</p>
<p>for a short time, but both motions were overruled. Judge Wing
</p>
<p>then asked the guilty defendants why sentence should not be passed
</p>
<p>on them. Some arose and protested their innocence. The judge in
</p>
<p>turn lectured them severely on their crime and pronounced sen-
</p>
<p>tence. Ammi Filley and Orlando Williams received ten years at
</p>
<p>hard labor in the state's prison at Jackson. William Corwin, Eben
</p>
<p>and Richard Price, Andrew J. Freeland, Dr. Ebenezer Farnham,
</p>
<p>and Aaron Mount were sentenced to eight years each, and the three
</p>
<p>Champlin brothers, Lyman, Erastus, and Willard, and Erastus
</p>
<p>Smith, to five years each. All twelve were then taken to Jackson
</p>
<p>prison by a special train provided by the Michigan Central Rail-
</p>
<p>road.8*
</p>
<p>The verdict was received by the Detroit press with gratitude
</p>
<p>that the city's reputation as a "Christian community" had been
</p>
<p>upheld against the attacks of base criminals. In Jackson, Editor
</p>
<p>De Land, in the Citizen, expressed his surprise and, he believed,
</p>
<p>that of the entire community. He felt that truth and justice had
</p>
<p>been "cheated of their prey," that the wrong men had been con-
</p>
<p>victed. In explanation, he could only conclude that not even
</p>
<p>"great legal talent could prevail against adverse public opinion
</p>
<p>backed by the almost . . . almighty power of a monied corporation."
</p>
<p>And he later cited the Ypsilanti Sentinel, the Jonesville T.elegraph,
</p>
<p>and the Battle Creek Journal as sharing his opinion.^^
</p>
<p>At this distance in time, it matters little whether the defendants
</p>
<p>were guilty or not. It is more important to view the trial as an
</p>
<p>example of the way in which the railroad company moved to de-
</p>
<p>fend itself against its enemies. The company officials urgently
</p>
<p>needed and were determined at all costs to secure a conviction
</p>
<p>in order to halt the attacks on the trains in Leoni and Grass Lake
</p>
<p>townships. That conviction, they were certain, could not have been
</p>
<p>gotten in Jackson County in the face of a hostile public opinion.
</p>
<p>After the depot burned and Phelps presented them with evidence
</p>
<p>that the Leonians were responsible for the fire. Brooks, Joy, and
</p>
<p>Clark eagerly seized the opportunity to try the road's enemies in
</p>
<p>another, more friendly jurisdiction. With a largely favorable press

</p>
<p>and public opinion, they pushed their advantage to the limit. The
</p>
<p>prosecution lawyers successfully appealed to the patriotism and
</p>
<p>sense of social order of the jury of Detroit businessmen and poli-
</p>
<p>ticians and convinced them that the defendants, who were clearly
</p>
<p>[ 100 ]
</p>
<p>guilty o criminal offenses in Jackson County, could reasonably be
</p>
<p>presumed to have burnt the depot in Detroit. The whole trial thus
</p>
<p>seems to have been part of a larger conflict of force between the
</p>
<p>Michigan Central and the farmers of Jackson County rather than
</p>
<p>a legal action of the people of the state of Michigan against some
</p>
<p>criminals who had burnt down a building. And the triumph of
</p>
<p>the company was signalized when Joy, after having paid Van Dyke
</p>
<p>and Van Arman $2,000 each for their services, and lesser sums to the
</p>
<p>other lawyers, rewarded Prosecuting Attorney Stuart with the sum
</p>
<p>of $500 for his services to the state.^^
</p>
<p>The feelinsf will not down, nevertheless, that the defendants
</p>
<p>had not burnt the depot. To a layman unversed in the law, it
</p>
<p>seems that the voluminous and conflicting evidence does not prove
</p>
<p>beyond a reasonable doubt that Fitch and company were guilty
</p>
<p>of the crime with which they were charged. And subsequent events,
</p>
<p>too, raise some doubts about the justice of the jury's decision.
</p>
<p>Four months after the trial, in January, 1852, the Michigan
</p>
<p>Central shops in Detroit were destroyed by fire, and two years after
</p>
<p>that, the passenger offices also burnt down. These later fires were
</p>
<p>undoubtedly accidents, contingent hazards of the early days of
</p>
<p>railroad operations. Was it not likely that the earlier fire in the
</p>
<p>freight depot was of similar origin and that no crime had been
</p>
<p>committed at all? ^'^
</p>
<p>Almost two years after the trial, Erastus Smith, one of the con-
</p>
<p>victed defendants, was pardoned and after his release, made out
</p>
<p>an affidavit, which was published in Burnett's Grass Lake news-
</p>
<p>paper, in which he revealed in great detail his relations with Phelps
</p>
<p>before the aiTests. Smith affirmed that he had been duped by Phelps
</p>
<p>and had had no connection with the burning of the depot. He
</p>
<p>declared that Phelps had approached him many times to swear
</p>
<p>falsely and involve Fitch and the others in the crime. Phelps had
</p>
<p>also suggested that the two of them go to Michigan Centre and talk
</p>
<p>to the boys at Filley's tavern "about something, no matter what,"
</p>
<p>while he, Phelps, would take notes. Thus, the arch-plotter craftily
</p>
<p>argued, "one of us could talk and the others could swear that they
</p>

</p>
<p>saw it, and in this way, we can back one another up." When Smith
</p>
<p>refused to go along, insisting that he was "not smart enough to go
</p>
<p>into such an operation as that," Phelps retorted, "God damn it,
</p>
<p>you are smart enough to tell a story and stick to it," adding that
</p>
<p>[ 101 ]
</p>
<p>that was all Smith had to do. He, Phelps, would make the state-
</p>
<p>ments and write them down and Smith would swear to them.
</p>
<p>Smith still refused, but was present at a meeting with Gay when
</p>
<p>when the latter agreed to go into the scheme with Phelps. Later,
</p>
<p>he received other propositions from Phelps, such as to pass counter-
</p>
<p>feit money, but declined these too. The next thing he knew he was
</p>
<p>arrested with Gay. The clear implication of Smith's whole story
</p>
<p>was that Phelps had turned on him when he had refused to join the
</p>
<p>conspiracy and had had him arrested so that he could not reveal
</p>
<p>the sordid details of the plot on the witness stand. It is, of course,
</p>
<p>possible that Smith concocted this version of his relations with
</p>
<p>Phelps to put his own role in the best possible light, and present
</p>
<p>himself as a victim rather than an accomplice of Phelps, as Seward
</p>
<p>had suggested in his closing address. Whatever Smith's role, it is
</p>
<p>not unreasonable to suspect that Phelps had been guilty of perjury
</p>
<p>and subornation of prejury as part of his plot to swear the Leoni
</p>
<p>people to jail. ^8
</p>
<p>In a broader sense, all the actions of the railroad company in this
</p>
<p>savage conflict may perhaps be understood more clearly in the
</p>
<p>light of contemporary business policy. Superintendent Brooks con-
</p>
<p>ceived the role of the company as one of pioneer development
</p>
<p>in a new land involving risks for which the investors were to be
</p>
<p>duly paid. He and his advisors accepted no broad social responsi-
</p>
<p>bility other than the efficient and profitable transportation of peo-
</p>
<p>ple and goods. The public as consumer or shipper or as voter en-
</p>
<p>tered little into any considerations of policy. The result was a
</p>
<p>shortsighted ruthlessness that accorded ill with the populist Amer-
</p>
<p>ican ethos and inevitably brought heated protest, which Super-
</p>
<p>intendent Brooks felt justified in ignoring. Not until the company
</p>
<p>felt that its strategic position in the state legislature as against
</p>
<p>rival pressure groups was threatened, did it act to turn aside and
</p>
<p>blunt the edge of protest. It thus received its first limited lesson in
</p>
<p>the conduct of public relations, a subject in which American in-
</p>
<p>dustry was to undergo a long and expensive process of education.
</p>
<p>The Michigan Central in the 1850's faced only its worried political

</p>
<p>henchmen who advised it to mollify public sentiment if continued
</p>
<p>favorable legislative action was expected. Later American corpora-
</p>
<p>tions were to face continuous bureaucratic regulation by self-acting
</p>
<p>defenders of the public interest brought into being by the clamor
</p>
<p>[ 102 ]
</p>
<p>of a mass electorate. American industry today has, in response,
</p>
<p>evolved in its publicity a rationale of social utility designed to
</p>
<p>minimize postive regulation. The Michigan Central, attacked by
</p>
<p>a combination of antimonopoly opinion and rival railroads, had
</p>
<p>to backtrack on its intransigeance and resort to conciliation in
</p>
<p>order to protect its favored economic and political position in the
</p>
<p>state.
</p>
<p>In Jackson County, outraged feelings and political strategy
</p>
<p>combined to keep alive the animus against the Michigan Central.
</p>
<p>The Whig American Citizen kept sniping at Brooks and the rail-
</p>
<p>road and their political allies. Whatever the specific occasion,
</p>
<p>whether attacking the company's political influence or bringing
</p>
<p>charges of monopoly, it lost no chance to drag in the fate of the
</p>
<p>convicted twelve and the martyred Fitch. Once, it concluded a re-
</p>
<p>port of a train crash in which many westbound immigrants had
</p>
<p>been killed with the reminder that other victims of the company's
</p>
<p>greed and overweening lust for power were also languishing in
</p>
<p>state's prison. Local excitement and hatred flared up to a new in-
</p>
<p>tensity late in 1852 around the person of Henry Phelps, who made
</p>
<p>the mistake of showing his face in Jackson County. While visiting
</p>
<p>friends in Grass Lake, he was arrested on a warrant sworn out by
</p>
<p>the indefatigable Burnett and charged with conspiracy to convict
</p>
<p>the men of Leoni. In the face of a loud clamor to jail the traitor
</p>
<p>and informer, the railroad station agent at Jackson hired a lawyer
</p>
<p>to defend him, reporting to Detroit that "all Leoni and Michigan
</p>
<p>Centre is after [Phelps]," and asking if the company wished to
</p>
<p>undertake the defense. The company evidently did, for it supplied
</p>
<p>the heavy bail of $5,000 fixed by the local justice, "a hot anti Rail
</p>
<p>Road man," according to the agent. The Jackson County grand
</p>
<p>jury indicted Phelps for conspiracy and the trial was set for March,
</p>
<p>1853. When the case came up, the company exerted itself to get
</p>
<p>its employee off. Phelps' lawyer asked for a change of venue to an-
</p>
<p>other county. The judge, after some hesitation based on his fear
</p>
<p>of the public reaction, was prevailed upon to grant the motion
</p>
<p>and the case was transformed to Washtenaw County. Then, the

<p>prosecuting attorney for Jackson County, Austin Blair, was per-
</p>
<p>suaded "to slide the whole thing by quietly" by Moses A. Mc-
</p>
<p>Naughton, a Free Soil state senator from Jackson, acting on behalf
</p>
<p>of the railroad. McNaughton, in reporting on the negotiations to
</p>
<p>[ 103 ]
</p>
<p>Joy in Detroit, explained that Blair was honest and could not be
</p>
<p>bribed, but since "his ambition far exceeded his avarice . . .," he
</p>
<p>could be appealed to on that basis. Blair obligingly dropped the
</p>
<p>case against Phelps on the ground that the indictment was tech-
</p>
<p>nically deficient, and the latter was for the moment safe from the
</p>
<p>toils of his enemies. A year later. Van Dyke advised Joy that Phelps
</p>
<p>had better disappear from the Michigan scene altogether, at least
</p>
<p>long enough for the statute of limitations to operate, because
</p>
<p>otherwise, the "Jackson County patriots" would continue to hound
</p>
<p>him and the company would be put to great expense to protect
</p>
<p>him.89
</p>
<p>"Has anyone sounded Burnett as to whether he can be induced
</p>
<p>to haul off?" McNaughton had asked Joy in exasperation while
</p>
<p>arranging for Phelps' rescue. For it was the irrepressible lawyer
</p>
<p>from Grass Lake who had emerged as Fitch's successor as the gadfly
</p>
<p>of the opposition to the railroad in Jackson County. After his
</p>
<p>acquittal in the trial, Burnett had seemingly taken a vow of
</p>
<p>eternal hostility to the Michigan Central and its officials for what
</p>
<p>he felt was their baseless persecution of innocent men and devoted
</p>
<p>himself to proving that justice had miscarried. It was he who had
</p>
<p>hounded Phelps with arrest. And in January, 1853, he changed his
</p>
<p>vocation and embarked on a career as publisher and editor of a
</p>
<p>fortnightly newspaper, Public Sentiment, dedicated to the cause
</p>
<p>of his comrades who were still in jail. "Five months imprisonment,"
</p>
<p>he declared, "has given us a keen and fiery disposition," and every
</p>
<p>issue of the paper, which appeared for more than a year, was filled
</p>
<p>with slashing attacks on the railroad company and everybody con-
</p>
<p>nected with the trial. As the self-proclaimed defender of justice,
</p>
<p>Burnett charged that the great railroad conspiracy was in fact a
</p>
<p>conspiracy against the men of Leoni for a crime which was never
</p>
<p>committed; that the company's agents and spies had been guilty
</p>
<p>of kidnapping, arson, and perjury as well as conspiracy; that Sup-
</p>
<p>erintendent Brooks knew that Phelps' testimony about the burning
</p>
<p>of the depot was false and paid for in "railroad gold"; and that
</p>
<p>Fitch had been murdered under color of law at the instigation

</p>
<p>and by the agency of the Michigan Central. To support his charges,
</p>
<p>Burnett reviewed and analyzed the evidence brought out at the
</p>
<p>trial with his sharp lawyer's mind and published new damaging
</p>
<p>evidence and displayed altogether, as one contemporary later re-
</p>
<p>[ 104 ]
</p>
<p>membered, "an acumen, audacity, and mendacity that astonished
</p>
<p>the bench and bar of the whole state." Fearless and even reckless
</p>
<p>in his exposures of the alleged machinations of Brooks and Stuart,
</p>
<p>he was threatened wath a libel suit but managed to stay clear of
</p>
<p>the law. In addition, Burnett struck out at the railroad as a mo-
</p>
<p>nopoly whose persecution of its opponents was only part of a
</p>
<p>general policy of ruthless exploitation of the people of Michigan.
</p>
<p>Any action against the company, any expression of hostility any-
</p>
<p>where in the state, found a place in Public Sentiment alongside of
</p>
<p>his own highly vituperative excoriations. To some, like the editor
</p>
<p>of the American Citizen, it seemed that Burnett had gone too far.
</p>
<p>De Land, for all his sympathy for the cause, editorially rebuked
</p>
<p>his colleague from Grass Lake for reflecting unjustly on the reputa-
</p>
<p>tion of individuals, even hinting that he was close to blackmail,
</p>
<p>and in August, 1854, obligingly reported that Public Sentiment
</p>
<p>had ceased publication.^^
</p>
<p>One of Burnett's chief aims in his foray into journalism had
</p>
<p>been to win a pardon for the convicted "conspirators" who were
</p>
<p>serving their terms in Jackson prison. And despite or even because
</p>
<p>of his dogmatic one-tracked sensationalism, he did perhaps as
</p>
<p>much as anyone to bring about this end. There had been some
</p>
<p>sentiment for a pardon right after the trial, but nothing came of it.
</p>
<p>Superintendent Brooks was reported as saying that "it had cost
</p>
<p>$50,000 to convict these men and that he would not consent that
</p>
<p>the governor should pardon a single man." As the issue was thrown
</p>
<p>into the political pond and spread wide circles of antirailroad
</p>
<p>sentiment, the company's officials became more seriously concerned
</p>
<p>with the matter. In the gubernatorial election campaign of 1851,
</p>
<p>the Whigs and the Democrats charged each other's candidates with
</p>
<p>promising, if elected, to pardon the "conspirators," and with
</p>
<p>posing as railroad men in Detroit and antirailroad men in Jackson
</p>
<p>County. The incumbent Democrat won the election, but Town-
</p>
<p>send E. Gidley, the Whig candidate who lived in Jackson County,
</p>
<p>won his home county, solely because the voters in Leoni and Grass
</p>
<p>Lake townships, who had the year before given the Democrats

</p>
<p>small majorities, now turned on the railroad-dominated admini-
</p>
<p>stration and gave large majorities to the Whigs.^i
</p>
<p>The next year, in the First Congressional District, which in-
</p>
<p>cluded Wayne, Livingston, Washtenaw, and Jackson counties,
</p>
<p>[ 105 ]
</p>
<p>David Stuart, Democrat, opposed William A. Howard, Whig. As
</p>
<p>far as Jackson County was concerned, the contest was one between
</p>
<p>the prosecuting attorney who had sent the innocent "conspirators"
</p>
<p>to jail and the man who had courageously defended them. Ac-
</p>
<p>cording to the American Citizen, it had been necessary to offer
</p>
<p>large sums of money "to conciliate the opposition of certain prom-
</p>
<p>inent democrats in this county to Stuart." Stuart realized his handi-
</p>
<p>cap and worked hard to overcome it. He signed, in company with
</p>
<p>prominent local citizens, a petition to the governor for the pardon
</p>
<p>of the prisoners. He personally tried to mollify the antirailroad
</p>
<p>men. He visited Benjamin F. Gleason, one of the defendants who
</p>
<p>had been acquitted, and who was a Democrat, and asked him to
</p>
<p>vote for him and tell others to do so. Stuart argued that it was he
</p>
<p>(Stuart) that had secured the acquittal of some of the "conspir-
</p>
<p>ators" and now sought a pardon for the rest. He promised Gleason
</p>
<p>a job with the state. The visit backfired when Gleason wrote a letter
</p>
<p>to the American Citizen revealing Stuart's machinations and bit-
</p>
<p>terly attacking him. He declared:
</p>
<p>Now he is fooled, for I cant lie for him, after being rode and made a
</p>
<p>cripple of by his lies, I cant vote for him. I defy him and the Michigan
</p>
<p>Central Railroad Company to fetch an illegal act of mine, done to him
</p>
<p>or that company.
</p>
<p>Gleason went on to proclaim the innocence of all the defendants
</p>
<p>and the falsity of the charges against them. "And you (Stuart)
</p>
<p>know it . . . ," he concluded, "and if you are an honest man, you
</p>
<p>will come out and tell the truth. That we ask at your hands before
</p>
<p>we can vote for you." Stuart's supporters were more successful in
</p>
<p>getting a letter from Orlando Williams, still serving his ten-year
</p>
<p>sentence, urging his friends to work for the Democrat, because if
</p>
<p>elected he would get a pardon for the prisoners. Stuart won the
</p>

<p>also voted for Howard because he freely expressed such views. In

<p>the next congressional election, in 1854, Stuart was soundly beaten

</p>
<p>The campaign for a pardon for at least three of the prisoners
</p>
<p>against whom there had been little or no incriminating evidence
</p>
<p>came to a climax when the legislature met in January, 1853.
</p>
<p>Governor Robert McLelland had been favorably considering the
</p>
<p>petition presented the previous fall and was awaiting the session
</p>
<p>to issue a pardon. Additional petitions from almost one thousand
</p>
<p>legal voters of Oakland and Jackson counties were presented to
</p>
<p>the House and Senate requesting a pardon for the "Central Rail-
</p>
<p>road prisoners." Joy himself, faced with mounting attacks in the
</p>
<p>legislature on the company's monopolistic privileges, finally saw
</p>
<p>the wisdom of pardoning some of the "conspirators." He and
</p>
<p>Superintendent Brooks had talked to three of them in jail and
</p>
<p>gotten assurances from them that, if pardoned, they would not re-
</p>
<p>new their attacks on the railroad. Joy realized, too, how tenuously
</p>
<p>implicated in the crime these men had been and, above all, that a
</p>
<p>pardon "would have a tendency to obliterate those feelings which
</p>
<p>unhappily seem to prevail to a considerable extent in that portion
</p>
<p>of the state against the company." At this point, progress bogged
</p>
<p>down in the political jockeying connected with the fight in the
</p>
<p>legislature between the Michigan Central and Michigan Southern
</p>
<p>forces. A special committee of the House had been appointed to
</p>
<p>consider the numerous petitions and report on them. The com-
</p>
<p>mittee, in a move to embarrass the governor and the Michigan
</p>
<p>Central, issued a report attacking the entire prosecution of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy case and presented a resolution recommending a pardon
</p>
<p>for all the "conspirators." A motion to adopt the report and the
</p>
<p>resolution and print five hundred copies was passed 39 to 23. On
</p>
<p>reconsideration, however, the house reversed itself and laid the
</p>
<p>matter on the table by a vote of 46 to 20. There the matter rested,
</p>
<p>until March 4, when Governor McLelland, just before resigning
</p>
<p>to take up his post as Secretary of the Interior in Pierce's cabinet,
</p>
<p>issued a pardon for Farnham, Erastus Champlin, and Smith. In
</p>
<p>support of his actions the governor cited the following: the favor-
</p>
<p>able application of the Michigan Central Railroad and its attorney,
</p>
<p>James F. Joy; the recommendation of David Stuart and prominent

</p>
<p>citizens of Jackson County; the petitions of more than 2,500 cit-
</p>
<p>izens; and finally, the good behavior of the prisoners.^^
</p>
<p>After the prison gates had swung open for the first three "con-
</p>
<p>spirators," the pardon of the rest soon followed. Governor Andrew
</p>
<p>[ 107 ]
</p>
<p>Parsons, McLelland's successor, pardoned one prisoner in October,
</p>
<p>1853, and five more in December, 1854. The reasons he gave were
</p>
<p>essentially the same as McLelland's: the petition of thousands of
</p>
<p>people, the request of prominent citizens of Jackson County as well
</p>
<p>as David Stuart and the attorney of the Michigan Central, plus
</p>
<p>the recommendation of the jury that had convicted them. The
</p>
<p>governor also cited "the deep interest which reliable men of all
</p>
<p>parties and interests have taken in these cases, and the general pre-
</p>
<p>vailing opinion that the ends of justice have been fully met." Ammi
</p>
<p>Filley and Orlando Williams, who had received the longest sen-
</p>
<p>tences, had to wait for their freedom until the victorious Repub-
</p>
<p>lican governor, Kinsley S. Bingham, came into office.^^
</p>
<p>The policy of conciliation, thus begun in 1853, also included
</p>
<p>the payment of indemnities to some of the defendants who had
</p>
<p>been acquitted at the trial. Before authorizing this step, Joy had
</p>
<p>a thorough investigation made to be sure that none of them had
</p>
<p>been guilty of any offenses against the railroad property or had any
</p>
<p>guilty knowledge of such. And when Wilbur F. Storey, editor
</p>
<p>of the Democratic Jackson Patriot.who had made the investigation,
</p>
<p>further assured him that "the effect on the public mind would be
</p>
<p>salutary," Joy made some financial restitution to them "for the
</p>
<p>lost time and other sacrifices arising from their arrest and de-
</p>
<p>tention." He was careful to insist, however, that this action was
</p>
<p>entirely gratuitous and that, as of right, these men were not en-
</p>
<p>titled to any compensation.^^
</p>
<p>It was at this time, too, that Joy entered into the arrangement
</p>
<p>with Senator Moses A. McNaughton of Jackson to act as his secret
</p>
<p>representative and adviser in matters involving the railroad in
</p>
<p>Jackson County. McNaughton, it is important to note, was not an
</p>
<p>administration Democrat but a Free Soiler who joined the fusion
</p>
<p>Republican Party the following year, and his employment reflected
</p>
<p>the company's growing concern with the political revolution then
</p>
<p>going on in Michigan. McNaughton, it will be recalled, arranged
</p>
<p>for the dropping of the case against Phelps. He had also urged on
</p>
<p>Joy the wisdom of procuring a pardon for the "conspirators" solely

</p>
<p>as a matter of policy, to mollify public feeling. After the first par-
</p>
<p>dons had been issued, the senator also furthered the railroad's new
</p>
<p>policy of conciliating the opposition by arranging with De Land,
</p>
<p>the antirailroad Whig editor of the Jackson American Citizen, to
</p>
<p>[ 108 ]
</p>
<p>publish a favorable article or two in his newspaper in return for
</p>
<p>a payment of fifty dollars. "With the ready" McNaughton assured
</p>
<p>his employer, "I can do anything I please." ^'^
</p>
<p>The pardon of the conspirators and the payment of indemnities,
</p>
<p>if meant to assuage outraged sentiments of neighborly loyalty and
</p>
<p>blunt the charges of injustice, were something less than effective.
</p>
<p>The old hurt continued to rankle, and a lively hatred of the Mich-
</p>
<p>igan Central still flourished in Leoni in 1854.^"^ The policy of
</p>
<p>conciliation also failed because the feeling against the railroad
</p>
<p>had become something more than local resentment over the per-
</p>
<p>secution of the innocents. It had burgeoned once more into a
</p>
<p>widespread opposition to the company as a monopoly which still
</p>
<p>refused to pay fairly for the cattle its trains killed, which fixed
</p>
<p>higher rates for short hauls than for long, and which prevented
</p>
<p>new and necessary railroads from being built in the state. Tangled
</p>
<p>in this skein of the antimonopoly movement was the feud between
</p>
<p>the Michigan Central and its rival, the Michigan Southern Rail-
</p>
<p>road, itself a giant corporation using every political and economic
</p>
<p>weapon to attack and gain an advantage over its competitor. Out of
</p>
<p>this juncture of interests and ideals emerged the movement for
</p>
<p>the enactment of a general railroad incorporation law to break
</p>
<p>the power of the Michigan Central Railroad.
</p>
<p>The demand that the railroad be made to pay for damages to
</p>
<p>property was heard again when the legislature met in 1853. As a
</p>
<p>public meeting in Birmingham stated in a resolution: "It is the
</p>
<p>duty of the law-making powers of the state to provide a code of
</p>
<p>laws, which will enable the most humble citizen to obtain his just
</p>
<p>right of property against incorporated wealth." Shoemaker's old
</p>
<p>bill, defeated in 1851, providing for a minimum of protection of
</p>
<p>property along the line of the railroads, was introduced again.
</p>
<p>This time, it was the House that passed the bill, with only one dis-
</p>
<p>senting vote, while the Senate turned it down. Not until 1855,
</p>
<p>when the legislature was under the control of the Republicans,
</p>
<p>were laws passed requiring the Michigan Central and the Michigan
</p>
<p>Southern railroads to take safety measures at all crossings and fence

<p>the right of way and making the companies liable for all cattle
</p>
<p>killed until the fences were erected.^s
</p>
<p>Criticism of the high freight rates that the Michigan Central
</p>
<p>charged farmers along its line also continued to be heard and led
</p>
<p>[ 109 ]
</p>
<p>to a renewed demand for the construction of a branch line between
</p>
<p>Jackson and Adrian as the only way of bringing down the rates.
</p>
<p>Businessmen and investors of Jackson who were financially inter-
</p>
<p>ested in the Grand River Valley Railroad, which they hoped would
</p>
<p>open up the interior of the state north of the Central Railroad
</p>
<p>and make Jackson a commercial center, also advocated the con-
</p>
<p>struction of the Jackson branch in order to connect their proposed
</p>
<p>line from Grand Rapids to Jackson with Adrian, Toledo, and the
</p>
<p>East. And all efforts were now concentrated on getting the Mich-
</p>
<p>igan Southern to build the Jackson-Adrian link, as it was legally
</p>
<p>required to do by its charter, but to no avail. The American Citizen
</p>
<p>faithfully supported the campaign through 1852 and warned that
</p>
<p>if the line were not built, "the Central Company [could] still filch
</p>
<p>the life blood from the business veins of the community and op-
</p>
<p>press and imprison and martyr our citizens at will." Not until
</p>
<p>the spring of 1853 did the directors of the Southern Railroad agree
</p>
<p>to undertake the construction of the Jackson branch, but, as will
</p>
<p>presently appear, entirely for their own reasons. Amos Root, a
</p>
<p>Jackson merchant and big investor in the Grand River Valley Rail-
</p>
<p>road, who was now a member of the lower house of the legislature,
</p>
<p>was the leading spirit behind the negotiations and finally got
</p>
<p>Elisha Litchfield, one of the Southern directors, to give his word
</p>
<p>that the line would be built in three years. Litchfield insisted,
</p>
<p>however, that his company be given without cost the right of way
</p>
<p>extending ten miles south of Jackson. The eager promoters agreed
</p>
<p>and three of them immediately gave personal bonds in the amount
</p>
<p>of $15,000 to secure the right of way. They started to buy up the
</p>
<p>necessary land, opened books for the sale of additional Southern
</p>
<p>Railroad capital stock to finance the project, and advertised for
</p>
<p>bids on construction material. At this point, the venture ran head-
</p>
<p>on into the opposition of the Michigan Central, whose agents
</p>
<p>bought up strategic parcels of land along the proposed right of way.
</p>
<p>This obstacle, too, was finally overcome and the land was secured,
</p>
<p>though at a cost of about $5,000 greater than planned, and several
</p>
<p>hundred men were put to work grading the right of way. To rally

</p>
<p>public support to the venture and raise additional funds, plans
</p>
<p>were made to hold a large mass meeting in Jackson on August 20,
</p>
<p>1853.99
</p>
<p>On the appointed day, two thousand citizens met at the court-
</p>
<p>[110]
</p>
<p>house in Jackson, with delegates attending from Lenawee, Hills-
</p>
<p>dale, Ingham, Eaton, Barry, Ionia, and Jackson counties. Speeches
</p>
<p>and resolutions all strongly demanded the construction of the Jack-
</p>
<p>son branch and the Grand River Valley Railroad. The courthouse
</p>
<p>rang with attacks on the monopoly maintained by the Michigan
</p>
<p>Central for its own benefit and that of the city of Detroit at the
</p>
<p>expense of the farmers of central Michigan. Singled out for attack
</p>
<p>were the measures taken by the Central Railroad to prevent the
</p>
<p>construction of the Jackson branch, which, it was declared, were
</p>
<p>cause enough for the forfeiture of the company's charter. It was
</p>
<p>resolved, too, that if the two proposed lines could not be built
</p>
<p>under the existing special charters, the people should seek passage
</p>
<p>of a general railroad law by the terms of which any group of in-
</p>
<p>vestors could build any lines they wished and could finance. The
</p>
<p>meeting closed with the appointment of a committee on permanent
</p>
<p>organization to carry on the good fight, another to raise additional
</p>
<p>funds, and a third to see the governor about the forfeiture of the
</p>
<p>Michigan Central's charter.^oo
</p>
<p>The company did not wait long to take countermeasures. Within
</p>
<p>the week, Superintendent Brooks and Joy filed a bill of chancery in
</p>
<p>the Wayne County Circuit Court in Detroit, complaining that
</p>
<p>the construction of the Jackson branch without their consent
</p>
<p>violated the terms of the company's charter and would tap its
</p>
<p>business and destroy its profits, and asking for an injunction to
</p>
<p>halt the work on the proposed line. In support of the plea, the bill
</p>
<p>cited section 5 of the company's charter, which provided that no
</p>
<p>railroad could be built from the eastern or southern boundary of
</p>
<p>the state, any part of which came within five miles of the line of
</p>
<p>the Michigan Central. The defense, representing the Michigan
</p>
<p>Southern and the backers of the Jackson branch, argued a pre-
</p>
<p>liminary motion that the suit should not have been brought in
</p>
<p>Wayne County but in Jackson County, where the alleged violation
</p>
<p>had taken place. After this motion was denied, the defense went on
</p>
<p>to argue that the Michigan Southern was only doing what it was re-
</p>
<p>quired by its charter to do, that is, complete the line from Adrian

<p>to Jackson. Judge Samuel Douglass maintained, however, that the
</p>
<p>actions of the defendants were clearly in conflict with the charter
</p>
<p>of the Michigan Central and in his decision ruled in favor of the
</p>
<p>complainants and granted the injunction. The work on the Jack-

</p>
<p>son branch was thus effectively stopped and its promoters could
</p>
<p>now look forward only to a general railroad law for relief.^"^
</p>
<p>The directors of the Michigan Southern had come perforce to
</p>
<p>the same conclusion. The two rival railroads had entered Chicago
</p>
<p>in the spring of 1852 and were engaged in a running fight to
</p>
<p>capture the through east-west traffic. Joy and Brooks labored
</p>
<p>mightily to gain an overland connection through Canada with
</p>
<p>Buffalo and the East to match the Southern's lake shore line. Late
</p>
<p>in 1852, the Southern carried the fight to the enemy by seeking an
</p>
<p>amendment to its charter allowing it to extend its line from Mon-
</p>
<p>roe to Detroit. Such a line would tap the Central's business and
</p>
<p>feed it, through the already-built Monroe-Toledo spur, into the
</p>
<p>Southern's through route from Chicago to Buffalo. When the
</p>
<p>Southern presented its petition to the legislature in 1853, J<^y ^'^'
</p>
<p>mediately wheeled his minions into line against it. The Detroit
</p>
<p>Free Press attacked the proposal as a blow to the commercial inter-
</p>
<p>ests of Detroit and a boon only to the through shippers of other
</p>
<p>states. The lawmakers took no action and gave Joy time to counter-
</p>
<p>attack with a petition for an amendment to the Michigan Central's
</p>
<p>charter to build its own line from Detroit to Toledo via Monroe.
</p>
<p>Faced with a deadlock in its efforts to get into Detroit from Toledo
</p>
<p>by an amendment to its charter, the Southern Railroad shifted its
</p>
<p>tactics and once again swung behind the movement for the passage
</p>
<p>of a general railroad incorporation law.^02
</p>
<p>Sentiment for such a law was steadily growing. Its popularity
</p>
<p>was reflected in Governor McLelland's annual message to the
</p>
<p>legislature in 1853. The Democratic governor recommended the
</p>
<p>passage of the law because "the growing necessities and increasing
</p>
<p>business of the state require the construction of new lines of rail-
</p>
<p>roads." The problem of amending the special charters to extend
</p>
<p>and change the lines of the existing roads, he added, could also
</p>
<p>be met by a general law. And even the correspondent of the Free
</p>
<p>Press reported from Lansing that most of the members of the legis-
</p>
<p>lature were in favor of the law in order "to open the way for the
</p>
<p>full competition of capital" and thus bring cheaper rates and

</p>
<p>other benefits.1^3
</p>
<p>When Joy heard from his agents in Lansing that the Southern
</p>
<p>Railroad was pushing the general railroad law, he marshaled all
</p>
<p>his forces once again to oppose it. In January, 1853, the Southern's
</p>
<p>[ 114]
</p>
<p>agents organized a large public meeting in Detroit to support the
</p>
<p>law, as the only way to give Detroit a connection with Toledo. Joy
</p>
<p>himself and his colleagues appeared in person to counteract the
</p>
<p>move, but the Southern supporters gained the day and a favorable
</p>
<p>resolution was passed. The second day, however, Joy and Van Dyke
</p>
<p>were successful in getting the meeting to reverse itself and approve
</p>
<p>a resolution opposing a general railroad law and endorsing an
</p>
<p>independent line to Toledo. Subsequently, the two rivals arranged
</p>
<p>meetings in other parts of the state to support their respective
</p>
<p>positions. The Free Press ran a series of long articles which argued
</p>
<p>that the law was detrimental to the interests of Detroit and would
</p>
<p>encourage unhealthy speculative ventures. The upshot of all these
</p>
<p>moves and countermoves as well as legislative intrigues was a vic-
</p>
<p>tory for the Michigan Central forces. The House passed the law but
</p>
<p>it was lost in the shuffle of unfinished business in the Senate. It was
</p>
<p>at this point that the Southern Railroad agreed to build the Jack-
</p>
<p>son branch in a flanking attack on their rivals, only to see this
</p>
<p>effort too stopped by the courts.^o^
</p>
<p>The victory of the Michigan Central, however, was only tem-
</p>
<p>porary, for the tide was running strongly against it. The supporters
</p>
<p>of the general railroad law greeted the setback in the legislature
</p>
<p>with charges that it had fallen victim to the rapacity of the Central
</p>
<p>Railroad and that Detroit and the railroad had defeated the wishes
</p>
<p>of the rest of the people of the state. They resumed the agitation
</p>
<p>at the end of 1853 with a series of public meetings in Detroit and
</p>
<p>Adrian culminating in another great mass meeting in Jackson on
</p>
<p>December 28. At these meetings. Governor Andrew Parsons was
</p>
<p>requested to call a special session of the legislature to act on the
</p>
<p>general railroad law in accordance with the wishes of the people.
</p>
<p>The governor managed to resist the pressure, explaining that there
</p>
<p>was no urgency in having the law passed, since the state of the
</p>
<p>money market was such that no new railroads could be built at
</p>
<p>this time anyway.i^^
</p>
<p>By 1854, even the Free Press was admitting editorially that most

</p>
<p>of the people wanted a general railroad law. And the issue became
</p>
<p>one of the ingredients in the bubbling political cauldron in the
</p>
<p>state. The Free Soil Democrats, meeting in convention in Jackson
</p>
<p>on February 22, 1854, wrote into their platform a plank on state
</p>
<p>affairs which called for a prohibition law, free schools, and a "gen-
</p>
<p>[ 115]
</p>
<p>eral law under which capital may be associated and combined for
</p>
<p>the prosecution of works of public improvement and of various
</p>
<p>industrial pursuits." The Detroit Daily Democrat, the Free Soil
</p>
<p>organ, later spelled this out to mean that the party favored a
</p>
<p>general railroad law. When the merger between the Free Soil Dem-
</p>
<p>ocrats and the antislavery Whigs took place the following July
</p>
<p>under the oaks in Jackson, the platform of the new Republican
</p>
<p>Party also demanded the passage of such a law. This plank was
</p>
<p>not, however, adopted without opposition. Jacob M. Howard, of
</p>
<p>Detroit, chairman of the resolutions committee, presented the
</p>
<p>majority report of the committee to the convention which said
</p>
<p>nothing of a general railroad law. It was Austin Blair of Jackson,
</p>
<p>also a member of the committee, who presented a minority report
</p>
<p>embodying planks on state affairs calling for reform in the ad-
</p>
<p>ministration of the state's finances and a general railroad law. This
</p>
<p>last resolution stated: "that in our opinion the commercial wants
</p>
<p>of the State require the enactment of a general railroad law, which,
</p>
<p>while it shall secure the investment, and encourage the enterprise,
</p>
<p>shall also guard and protect the rights of the public and of in-
</p>
<p>dividuals . . ." Blair's resolutions were considered too radical by
</p>
<p>the sixteen members of the committee and had not been accepted.
</p>
<p>When Blair presented his minority report to the convention at
</p>
<p>large, the chairman, David S. Walbridge of Kalamazoo, considered
</p>
<p>by some a tool of the Michigan Central, refused to put the question
</p>
<p>to a vote. Trying to bury the resolutions, he unceremoniously left
</p>
<p>the chair and started for his hotel before the convention had ad-
</p>
<p>journed. Angry delegates pursued him, brought him back and
</p>

<p>ever, the American Citizen repeatedly urged the election of Austin
</p>
<p>Blair, who was running for the Senate on the Republican ticket,
</p>
<p>as a true supporter of such a law. It declared that the election
</p>
<p>would decide whether Michigan would have the law or not and
</p>
<p>accused the Democrats of giving it only sham support.^or
</p>
<p>[ 116]
</p>
<p>When the Republicans swept the state in November, the way
</p>
<p>was cleared for the passage of the law in the new legislature. Even
</p>
<p>Governor Parsons, in his last message before going out of office,
</p>
<p>now recommended the law. The new governor, Kinsley S. Bingham,
</p>
<p>claimed in his inaugural address that the law was demanded by
</p>
<p>nearly unanimous public sentiment and was necessary for the rapid
</p>
<p>development of the state's economic resources. Austin Blair, now
</p>
<p>the majority leader in the Senate, introduced the bill and managed
</p>
<p>its progress through the upper house. In a last ditch stand, James
</p>
<p>A. Van Dyke, now counsel for the Michigan Central, presented a
</p>
<p>memorial to the Senate, opposing the law and claiming that it
</p>
<p>violated the terms of the company's charter by allowing competing
</p>
<p>railroads to be built. He argued that the company had paid two
</p>
<p>million dollars to the state, not for the mere physical property and
</p>
<p>tangible assets, but for the valuable but intangible monopoly
</p>
<p>privileges. If the state was weary of the contract into which it had
</p>
<p>entered, he queried, why did it not repurchase the railroad at the
</p>
<p>terms provided in the charter? The Senate ignored Van Dyke's
</p>
<p>appeal and passed the bill unanimously. Before the month was out,
</p>
<p>it had passed the lower house too and become law.^^^^
</p>
<p>The new law was certainly no panacea for Michigan's railroad
</p>
<p>problems. It did, however, register adequately contemporary
</p>
<p>thought on this important economic issue. Under its terms, any
</p>
<p>group of investors who met the minimum conditions could secure
</p>
<p>a charter and organize a corporation to build and operate a rail-
</p>
<p>road. Railroad companies thus received the same privileges that
</p>
<p>had been extended to plank road, telegraph, and mining com-
</p>
<p>panies in 1851 and to all manufacturing enterprises in 1853. Al-
</p>
<p>though the state thereby relinquished in large part the right to
</p>
<p>direct economic enterprise, it did not abandon its right to regulate
</p>
<p>such activities. It is significant that the opposition to the general
</p>
<p>railroad law had not been based on the principle of laissez faire
</p>
<p>but on the practical arguments that it favored the Michigan South-
</p>
<p>ern Railroad and thus harmed the interests of Detroit. Only Van

<p>Dyke had, when it was already too late, brought up the issue of
</p>
<p>breach of contract. And the regulations written into the new law,
</p>
<p>though relatively ineffective because little or no means of enforce-
</p>
<p>ment were provided, were positive enough. All new railroads
</p>
<p>organized under the act were required to install such safety meas-
</p>
<p>[ 117 ]
</p>
<p>ures as bells on locomotives, a steam whistle to be sounded before
</p>
<p>all grade crossings, "stop, look, and listen" signs at the crossings,
</p>
<p>fences along the right of way, and special farm crossings with cattle
</p>
<p>guards where necessary. Maximum passenger fares were fixed,
</p>
<p>though at the high rate of three cents a mile. The legislature was
</p>
<p>also given the right to reduce all rates but not to an extent that
</p>
<p>would produce less than a 15 per cent annual return on capital
</p>
<p>stock paid in.^^
</p>
<p>The passage of the law in 1855 was followed in short order by
</p>
<p>the construction of the new lines previously proposed. The Jackson
</p>
<p>branch was completed to Manchester within the year and to Jack-
</p>
<p>son in 1857 under the auspices of the Southern Railroad, by then
</p>
<p>known as the Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana. The
</p>
<p>Grand River Valley Railroad was completed in 1870. Stockholders
</p>
<p>of the Southern Railroad also organized the Detroit, Monroe and
</p>
<p>Toledo Railroad which connected its two termini in 1857. But
</p>
<p>the much hoped for competition between the two major rival lines
</p>
<p>did not materialize. In 1857, the Michigan Central and the Mich-
</p>
<p>igan Southern and Northern Indiana entered into an agreement
</p>
<p>to pool all through passenger and freight traffic on a percentage
</p>
<p>basis.^i^^
</p>
<p>After the passage of the general railroad law, public agitation
</p>
<p>and antagonism faded temporarily in the sequel of war and boom,
</p>
<p>to revive again in the crisis of the 1870's. And time and circum-
</p>
<p>stance removed the chief actors in the great railroad conspiracy
</p>
<p>from the scene. Some of the key witnesses at the trial met sorry ends.
</p>
<p>Phelps, who had been given a job on the railroad, went to Texas
</p>
<p>and was killed in a brawl, while Wescott died in Dearborn of
</p>
<p>delirium tremens. Wolliver succumbed in an Illinois jail where he
</p>
<p>was serving time for highway robbery. Lake saw the inside of Jack-
</p>
<p>son prison again before he passed on.m
</p>
<p>Quite different fates befell the railroad officials and lawyers.
</p>
<p>Superintendent Brooks relinquished control of the operations of
</p>
<p>the Michigan Central and moved upstairs to the presidency, and

<p>he and Joy turned their organizing efforts further west. Darius
</p>
<p>Clark was rewarded with an appointment as general ticket agent
</p>
<p>of the Michigan Central Railroad in New York City. He returned
</p>
<p>to the state once but was quite reticent about the part he had played
</p>
<p>in convicting the "conspirators." Van Dyke became one of the
</p>
<p>[ "8]
</p>
<p>lawyers for the Michigan Central in 1852, while Van Arman left
</p>
<p>for Chicago in 1858 and was there appointed to the legal staflE of
</p>
<p>the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, which Joy and
</p>
<p>Brooks had such a large part in organizing and promoting.1^2
</p>
<p>Most of the defendants returned to their homes to spin out their
</p>
<p>lives in welcome obscurity. But Ammi Filley, embittered and
</p>
<p>restless, shook the dust of Leoni from his heels and moved to
</p>
<p>Illinois and then to Nebraska, where he died in the i88o's.ii3
</p>
<p>In Jackson County, however, the great railroad conspiracy re-
</p>
<p>mained a focus of resentment that was elaborated in the course of
</p>
<p>time into a legend of injustice and heroism. A directory of the
</p>
<p>city of Jackson, published in 1869, recorded that the people had
</p>
<p>outlived the unhappy effects of the railroad troubles, "though the
</p>
<p>convictions in the minds of the surviving parties as to who was
</p>
<p>right and who wrong, remain now about the same as then." When
</p>
<p>a Jackson newspaper in later years retold the story of the arrests
</p>
<p>and trial, it concluded the account with a touch becoming an an-
</p>
<p>cient epic: "And thus were the ends of justice defeated and money
</p>
<p>and power and villainous craft triumphed over innocence and
</p>
<p>helplessness." By that time, the Michigan Central had become "a
</p>
<p>growing and thriving corporation" which had made mistakes
</p>
<p>"which wiser members in sober moments have acknowledged and
</p>
<p>deplored ..." The spies, Phelps, Gay, Wescott, and Lake, were the
</p>
<p>villains in this morality play and on them the writer poured his
</p>
<p>wrath. As for Fitch, he wrote:
</p>
<p>Abel F. Fitch died a crushed and heart-broken but guileless man, and
</p>
<p>an honest Christian gentleman. The fact that the prisoners were all
</p>
<p>pardoned at the suggestion of the railroad company and their lawyers,
</p>
<p>that a tender of damages was made to them after being released, and that
</p>
<p>the witnesses, to this day, all stand convicted for perjury, is, of itself,
</p>
<p>vindication enough for all.^*
</p>
<p>By 1881, the gray of truth had darkened into the black myth
</p>
<p>of villainy. A history of the county published in that year told the
</p>
<p>story of how the spies, "disreputable scoundrels . . . cowards and

</p>
<p>villains . . . reptiles," had failed to discover any of the culprits who
</p>
<p>had been obstructing the tracks and had resolved to swear to any-
</p>
<p>thing to collect the reward offered by the railroad company. They
</p>
<p>had set fire to the depot in Detroit and then had sworn that inno-
</p>
<p>cent citizens living sixty miles away had hired one of them to do it.
</p>
<p>[ "9]
</p>
<p>At the trial, these scoundrels had been "willing instruments in the
</p>
<p>hands of the railroad company" and one unprincipled lawyer,
</p>
<p>Van Arman, who coached them in the art of perjury.^^^
</p>
<p>Colonel De Land, onetime editor of the Jackson American
</p>
<p>Citizen, in his history of Jackson County compiled in 1903, re-
</p>
<p>peated the same story. He inveighed against the villainy of the
</p>
<p>railroad's agents and spies and assured the world "that their victims
</p>
<p>were in prison for a crime they never committed," And concluded
</p>
<p>his tale thus: "A beautiful marble monument stands over the grave
</p>
<p>of Captain Fitch and the story is still told of the wickedness of
</p>
<p>his taking off." ^^^
