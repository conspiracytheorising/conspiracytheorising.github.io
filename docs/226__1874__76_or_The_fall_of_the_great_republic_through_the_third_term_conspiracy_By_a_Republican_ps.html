<p>PREFACE.
</p>
<p>The author's heart owes an apology to his head
</p>
<p>and the public, for publishing this hastily written
</p>
<p>brochure, in place of a long- conceived work, to be
</p>
<p>carefully prepared, and extended to embrace the
</p>
<p>history of the causes and influences which produced
</p>
<p>the rise of our Republic, to the time of the civil war,
</p>
<p>and, by contrasting them with those which have
</p>
<p>obtained since then, demonstrate the danger of its
</p>
<p>Fall. The downward march of events, however, has
</p>
<p>outstripped my time and pen, until, in unfeigned
</p>
<p>alarm at the immediate approach of this danger, I
</p>
<p>have been, perhaps, unduly persuaded by my feel
</p>
<p>ings and friends to publish the second part of my
</p>
<p>work first, and in outline only, in the humble and
</p>
<p>sincere hope that its logic and purpose may atone, to
</p>
<p>the public, for its want of literary style and merit,
</p>
<p>and that that purpose may not miscarry. The design
</p>
<p>is to show that, by gradual steps of departure from
</p>
<p>constitutional landmarks and by centralization of

</p>
<p>" claimant," a portion of the once " Sovereign " States
</p>
<p>of the Union has been ruthlessly and utterly over-
</p>
<p>thrown. That, not only is the tendency to the com-
</p>
<p>plete overthrow of the whole, in time, inevitable, but
</p>
<p>that there is a conspiracy in existence for their
</p>
<p>gradual usurpation, and the establishment of a mili-
</p>
<p>tary despotism upon the ruins of the Republic.
</p>
<p>That the Third Term is the key to the plot, and to
</p>
<p>the power by which it is to be consummated ; and
</p>
<p>that the usurpation will not stop with the State, but
</p>
<p>that free suffrage and individual rights are also to be
</p>
<p>overthrown.
</p>
<p>That we are drifting on the nood-tide of corruption,
</p>
<p>bred of the supremacy of the money power, from one
</p>
<p>war inevitably into another, against  not the Union,
</p>
<p>as before, but against the Republic itself, unless
</p>
<p>the moral strength of this Third Term conspiracy is
</p>
<p>stamped out at once by popular indignation and
</p>
<p>alarm, and its support made odious and dangerous.
</p>
<p>That the military element is, by nature, hostile to
</p>
<p>and dangerous in the civil service of a Republic,
</p>
<p>and must be removed by making military men
</p>
<p>ineligible to the office of President at least, their
</p>
<p>right to which they must resign when they accept
</p>
<p>military honors from the Republic, in lieu of its civil
</p>
<p>honors. That what is and has been transpiring since

<p>the last Presidential election is and was part of this
</p>
<p>PREFACE. 7
</p>
<p>scheme, and that it had its origin in Presidential as-
</p>
<p>pirations, prior to that time.
</p>
<p>That what has followed was the legitimate effects
</p>
<p>of causes then existing ; that the sequence has been
</p>
<p>in natural order, and, unless those causes are removed,
</p>
<p>these effects must continue to their complete logical
</p>
<p>termination.
</p>
<p>In order that these premises may be established
</p>
<p>beyond argument or cavil, the conclusions admitted,
</p>
<p>and the people aroused to the imminence of their
</p>
<p>danger, the plot of the book, which represents the
</p>
<p>plot or conspiracy itself  step by step, in the order
</p>
<p>of occurrence or execution  is introduced in the
</p>
<p>Dream of Ulysses, written by the author immediately
</p>
<p>after the Philadelphia Convention of 1872. To the
</p>
<p>remarkable and alarming exactness and rapidity of
</p>
<p>the fulfilment of this dream especial attention is
</p>
<p>asked, as to its general outlines, if not to all its minor
</p>
<p>details.
</p>
<p>From such fulfilment of the author's predictions,
</p>
<p>or rather inductions, of two years ago, contained, not
</p>
<p>only in the dream, but also in the sequel, written im-
</p>
<p>mediately after that election, he now claims credence
</p>
<p>for his demonstration of the methods by which the
</p>
<p>plot is to be developed and pushed, and for the essen-
</p>
<p>tial fulfilment of his present, as well as his former

</p>
<p>perative duty of every man will appear, and the peo-
</p>
<p>ple rise as one man in patriotic and untiring effort,
</p>
<p>forgetting all parties, to overthrow the present
</p>
<p>"claimant" at the next election, if he cannot be
</p>
<p>driven by popular indignation to withdraw from the
</p>
<p>Presidential contest.
</p>
<p>That, to make this secure beyond chance, the peo-
</p>
<p>ple must be aroused to the danger at once, before
</p>
<p>public opinion is influenced on the Third Term ques-
</p>
<p>tion, by the making up of party issues, and the draw-
</p>
<p>ing of party lines ; while the people are free to think
</p>
<p>and act ; before party fealty is required, and the
</p>
<p>nominations are made. That the work must be done
</p>
<p>"before this, if at all, and the time is none too long.
</p>
<p>That if it is not done, ./foe elections may never be seen
</p>
<p>again, in this country, until a people's war shall re-
</p>
<p>store them.
</p>
<p>That, in the coming struggle between Liberty and
</p>
<p>Despotism, he that is not for the Republic and its
</p>
<p>principles is against it; and that there can be but two
</p>
<p>parties to the real and vital issue  the '"anti-Third
</p>
<p>Term," or the people's party of Liberty, and the anti-
</p>
<p>Republic, or office-holder's party of Despotism, de-
</p>
<p>bauched by plunder, and reeking with corruption
</p>
<p>and fraud. That this is the issue, big with fate to
</p>
<p>us, to the world, and to posterity ; and that it must

</p>
<p>Republican governments will have proved a failure,
</p>
<p>in the judgment of mankind.
</p>
<p>That, as to the present struggles going on between
</p>
<p>these same principles and powers in the South, the
</p>
<p>North must speak out, in tones that shall be heard
</p>
<p>and respected at Washington, or we shall wake up
</p>
<p>too late, with our hands bound by the same infamous
</p>
<p>chains, our ballot-boxes overturned by the same con-
</p>
<p>spirators, upheld by the same bayonets, commanded
</p>
<p>by this same " Third Term ' or Life " Claimant."
</p>
<p>Trust him not, North nor South ; nor Black nor
</p>
<p>White; a friend to none, betraying all, a common
</p>
<p>enemy.
</p>
<p>And when election day is o'er,
</p>
<p>When he is driven from the door,
</p>
<p>The White House to disgrace no more,
</p>
<p>Let laws be passed, to stand between
</p>
<p>Our homes and these disgraceful scenes.

<p>the dream.

<p>Cajoled, and nattered by the hour,

<p>He smokes, and dreams of kingly power.
</p>
<p>I, Ulysses, once was told
</p>
<p>A hackneyed legend, quaint and old,
</p>
<p>Which makes a century near complete,
</p>
<p>Since Freedom won this proud retreat;
</p>
<p>Where human wisdom, ripe and pure,
</p>
<p>Framed model laws, that should endure,
</p>
<p>When thrones and crowns should melt away,
</p>
<p>And tyrants cease to spoil and prey ;
</p>
<p>When feudal lords should shrink in dread,
</p>
<p>Before this grand Republic's tread.
</p>
<p>Thus, dreamed its founders, years ago,
</p>
<p>And vainly men believed it so,

<p>When thrice, in blood, the compact sealed,

</p>
<p>A mighty war its strength revealed ;
</p>
<p>14 '76 : OK, THE FALL OF THE GREAT REPUBLIC.
</p>
<p>When Vict'rj led its conq'ring hosts,
</p>
<p>Till treason ceased, and rebel boasts
</p>
<p>Were heard no more throughout the land ;
</p>
<p>When Peace and Union, hand in hand,
</p>
<p>Had hovered o'er the North and South,
</p>
<p>With words of pardon in their mouth.
</p>
<p>To honor arms that saved the state,
</p>
<p>And stayed the tide of blood and hate,
</p>
<p>In gratitude, for conquered peace,
</p>
<p>This gen'rous people gave me lease
</p>
<p>Of power  because their soldiers' chief 
</p>
<p>Then turned from war, in glad relief,
</p>
<p>To win a prosperous, happy peace,
</p>
<p>And pay the war debt's vast increase.
</p>
<p>They left me at the helm of state,
</p>
<p>To close the ghastly wounds of hate ;
</p>
<p>Assigned the nation's power, in trust,
</p>
<p>To check corruption, fraud, and lust,
</p>
<p>Until a stipulated hour,
</p>
<p>I should return their lease of power,
</p>
<p>With full accounts of how 'twere used,
</p>
<p>So they might judge if 'twere abused.
</p>
<p>Before the lease could be renewed,
</p>
<p>My stewardship should be reviewed.
</p>
<p>But now  I have betrayed that trust ;
</p>
<p>Have fostered hatred, fraud, and lust ;
</p>
<p>Assumed my right to place and power
</p>
<p>Beyond that stipulated hour;

</p>
<p>Withheld the record of its use,
</p>
<p>? 76 : OR, THE FALL OF THE GREAT REPUBLIC. 15
</p>
<p>And then denied there is abuse ;
</p>
<p>Denied the right to be reviewed,
</p>
<p>And now demand that lease renewed,
</p>
<p>In name of party, at whose head
</p>
<p>I cling to power on issues dead ;
</p>
<p>Whose only plank  it is my last 
</p>
<p>Is but the record of the past.
</p>
<p>So long have I betrayed this trust,
</p>
<p>To gratify my greed and lust
</p>
<p>For gain, and name, and sov'reign power,
</p>
<p>That now 1 dread the parting hour,
</p>
<p>When to my shades I must return,
</p>
<p>For fortune ne'er again will earn
</p>
<p>Such place, and power, and wealth, and fame
</p>
<p>As chance has poured upon my name.
</p>
<p>If I permit the people's voice,
</p>
<p>They will reject my second choice.
</p>
<p>I am resolved, by Cabinet backed,
</p>
<p>To lobby through th' Enforcement act,
</p>
<p>The Civil Service  damn Reform !
</p>
<p>If loyal members don't perform,
</p>
<p>I'll bring with fearful weight to bear
</p>
<p>My patronage, on those who dare
</p>
<p>Oppose the mandates of my will,
</p>
<p>And vote against the Ku Klux bill.

<p>TIIE SEQUEL.
</p>
<p>And now this fierce campaign is past ;
</p>
<p>The ship of State is grounding fast ;
</p>
<p>Although not wrecked, she may be sunk
</p>
<p>By crew debauched  with victory drunk,
</p>
<p>The smoke of battle clears away
</p>
<p>To leave this dreamer still in sway.
</p>
<p>Before  few stopped to think  reflect 
</p>
<p>But blindly fought to re-elect ;
</p>
<p>Spurred on by party whip and pen,
</p>
<p>And led by office-holding men.
</p>
<p>Forgot the safety of the State,
</p>
<p>Incited by misguided hate

<p>Of men, while principles were lost,
</p>
<p>Or simply worth the sums they cost.
</p>
<p>But action, now, gives place to thought,
</p>
<p>Which should have led the men who wrought
</p>
<p>The work their cooler judgments doubt.
</p>
<p>For, since they put their foes to route,
</p>
<p>They dread far less proposed amends,
</p>
<p>Than evils breeding with their friends.

<p>Shall turn to ashes on their lips,
</p>
<p>And Freedom reel, in wine that drips
</p>
<p>From wounds, to which they closed their eyes,
</p>
<p>Before it was too late to rise,
</p>
<p>And since, corruption planned the scheme
</p>
<p>Foretold so truly, in his dream,
</p>
<p>Writ months ago before the vote
</p>
<p>Had proved the truth of what was wrote.
</p>
<p>His dream, thus far, has been fulfilled ;
</p>
<p>The scheme has carried as he willed.
</p>
<p>He has secured the people's voice,
</p>
<p>Although against that people's choice ;
</p>
<p>And claims this is a final bar
</p>
<p>To all complaints that were, or are.
</p>
<p>With vict'ry flushed, his stubborn will
</p>
<p>Shall brook less opposition still ;

<p>By slow approaches, to control

<p>What law would stay his ruthless hand,
</p>
<p>Should he another war provoke,

<p>To raise an army  and invoke

<p>Its aid  corrupted first, by gold ?

<p>France thus was twice betrayed and sold
</p>
<p>By tyrants, worse than those who, born
</p>
<p>To power and honor, would but scorn
</p>
<p>To plunder those they would oppress
</p>
<p>And plunge a nation in distress.

</p>
<p>'Tis useless to dispute my sway ;
</p>
<p>I euchred you  you made it black,
</p>
<p>I hold your Joker, Left, and Jack.

</p>
<p>On which your homes, your lives and flag
</p>
<p>Shall burn to ashes  worthless rag !
</p>
<p>For I will kindle war again,
</p>
<p>And rear a throne with arms and men,
</p>
<p>Where this Republic stood before.
</p>
<p>The people are supreme no more.
</p>
<p>With all disguise I soon shall cease ;
</p>
<p>It served me well  6 Let us have peace.'
</p>
<p>To horse, my knights, the times grow kind;
</p>
<p>My organs shall keep guard behind.
</p>
<p>Election day approaches fast,
</p>
<p>Halt not, but ride till it is past.
</p>
<p>No foreign war could I invoke,
</p>
<p>Nor petty nation thus provoke,

<p>Tims am I left this last resort,
</p>
<p>With fiends and black men to consort ;
</p>
<p>Precipitate, with deep disgrace,
</p>
<p>A cruel war, a war of race,
</p>
<p>Upon our brethren of the South,
</p>
<p>Left powerless in the demon's mouth,
</p>
<p>Which party fastened on its neck ;
</p>
<p>Which has devoured all left by wreck
</p>
<p>Of dreadful war. This scourge of peace
</p>
<p>The South has borne without release ;
</p>
<p>These nine long years, in patience borne,
</p>
<p>Such tyrannies as would have torn
</p>
<p>A Northern State long since with war.
</p>
<p>This patience now we scourge them for.

</p>
<p>With galling laws, to tempt to wrong ;
</p>
<p>Yet all, they bore in silent pain ;
</p>
<p>We watched for some excuse in vain ;

<p>And fix on them some gross offence,
</p>
<p>That, in the name of law's defence,
</p>
<p>The army hence I may command,
</p>
<p>To hold the polls within my hand.
</p>
<p>When Congress shall assemble next,
</p>
<p>I first will make these ills the text
</p>
<p>For opening up the war again,
</p>
<p>To raise a standing army then,
</p>
<p>And garrison both South and West ;

<p>Which Custer's raid was to invoke,

<p>A frontier army guard the West,
</p>
<p>And on the Mississippi rest,

<p>Whose entrance now is in control ;
</p>
<p>The base and key to hold the whole.
</p>
<p>With this reserve, to wait or do,
</p>
<p>The South, I then will hot pursue.
</p>
<p>I have already there the tools ;
</p>
<p>The Knaves to guide my willing fools 
</p>
<p>The Blacks  both spoiling for a fight,
</p>
<p>That they may plunder left and right.

<p>This is the people's last appeal
</p>
<p>To ballots free  next comes the steel,
</p>
<p>And wreck of war, all that is left
</p>
<p>When once of Liberties bereft.
</p>
<p>Our enginery of war and peace
</p>
<p>He holds intact, nor would release
</p>
<p>Until we stopped his cannon's mouth,
</p>
<p>And then  what then ! we, like the South,
</p>
<p>In ruin left, could not emerge
</p>
<p>For scores of years from war's fierce scourge.
</p>
<p>Oh, Freemen, listen ! Cease your strife
</p>
<p>For party spoils ; for death or life
</p>
<p>To this Republic now impend,
</p>
<p>Which Freedom calls us to defend.
</p>
<p>Arise, before another flood
</p>
<p>Shall bear away our bravest blood.

<p>'76 : OR, THE FALL OF THE GREAT REPUBLIC.
</p>
<p>Alas ! One hundred years this all
</p>
<p>Of Liberty before the Fall \
</p>
<p>What dreadful portents, then, are these ?
</p>
<p>Whence evil omens we appease %
</p>
<p>Why seek our fears to cover o'er 
</p>
<p>These strange coincidents ignore \
</p>
<p>Why strive to banish from our mind
</p>
<p>This horrid spectre of mankind ?
</p>
<p>Is this the land of Washington %
</p>
<p>Are these the liberties he won
</p>
<p>The " Father of his country's " praise?
</p>
<p>This, his successor, who betrays %
</p>
<p>This, Charon grim the Eiver Styx
</p>
<p>He drives us o'er in " Seventy-six?"
</p>
<p>It guarded long, Columbia's shore ;
</p>
<p>No Charon dared it cross before,
</p>
<p>Nor leave the tyrant's loathsome shades.
</p>
<p>Before him now our watch-fire fades,
</p>
<p>And Freedom's light dies on our shore;
</p>
<p>While, waiting at Inferno's door,
</p>
<p>His ministers conduct us led
</p>
<p>To torments which our Fathers fled.
</p>
<p>From whence come all this ugly brood %
</p>
<p>War's evil genii, sharp for food,
</p>
<p>Have bred this curse this side the Styx
</p>
<p>To overthrow our " Seventy-Six."
</p>
<p>E'en on that sacred year's return,
</p>
<p>Its " Declaration" they would spurn ;
</p>
<p>And desecrate its holy name,
</p>
<p>By tyrant's rule, and freeman's shame ;
</p>
<p>And make a byword of our name,

<p>44 '76 : ok, the fall of the geeat republic.
</p>
<p>Once honored for its virtue's fame.
</p>
<p>Thus, all our sacred names are used ;
</p>
<p>The people's confidence abused,
</p>
<p>And e'en our once great party's name
</p>
<p>Is used to consummate our shame.
</p>
<p>The power it won in Freedom's cause
</p>
<p>Is now subverting all our laws.
</p>
<p>It crushed the " rebel," freed the slave,
</p>
<p>And now is used to dig the grave,
</p>
<p>And forge the chains, for Black and White.
</p>
<p>And North and South, with ev'ry right.
</p>
<p>Our Commerce languishes, and lies
</p>
<p>With sailless masts against the skies.
</p>
<p>Our Industries, with doubtful strife,
</p>
<p>Yet cling to feeble hopes of life.
</p>
<p>Our Labor waits to be employed,
</p>
<p>And all the wheels of Trade are cloyed.
</p>
<p>Our Agriculture groans and cries
</p>
<p>Until indignant Grangers rise.
</p>
<p>Our willing hands, to delve or carve,
</p>
<p>Are idle left, to steal, or starve.
</p>
<p>E'en Capital, with silent dread,
</p>
<p>Shrinks back, and hides from storms ahead.
</p>
<p>>'<> grand projections now are laid,
</p>
<p>And progress through our land is stayed.
</p>
<p>Whose faithless hands control such power ?
