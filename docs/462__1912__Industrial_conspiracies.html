<p>and the occasion makes it one of the greatest speeches of our time.
</p>
<p>It is the hope of the publishers that this message of Mr. Darrow's
</p>
<p>may reach the millions of men, women and youth of our country, that
</p>
<p>they may see the labor problem plainer and that they may receive
</p>
<p>hope and inspiration in their efforts to make a better and juster world.

<p>Industrial Conspiracies
</p>
<p>By CLARENCE S. DARROW
</p>
<p>Mr. Darrow said :
</p>
<p>I feel very grateful to you for the warmth and earnestness
</p>
<p>of your reception. It makes me feel sure that I am amongst
</p>
<p>friends. If I had to be tried again, I would not mind taking a
</p>
<p>change of venue to Portland (applause) ; although I think I
</p>
<p>can get along where I am without much difficulty.
</p>
<p>The subject for tonight's talk was not chosen by me but
</p>
<p>was chosen for me. I don't know who chose it, nor just what
</p>
<p>they expected me to say, but there is not much in a name, and
</p>
<p>I suppose what I say tonight would be just about the same
</p>
<p>under any title that anybody saw fit to give.
</p>
<p>I am told that I am going to talk about "Industrial Con-
</p>
<p>spiracies." I ought to know something about them. And I
</p>
<p>wont tell you all I know tonight, but I will tell you some things
</p>
<p>that I know tonight.
</p>
<p>The conspiracy laws, you know, are very old. As one promi-
</p>
<p>nent laboring man said on the witness stand down in Los
</p>
<p>Angeles a few weeks ago when they asked him if he was not
</p>
<p>under indictment and what for, he said he was under indict-
</p>
<p>ment for the charge they always made against working men
</p>
<p>when they hadn't done anything conspiracy And that is the

</p>
<p>charge they alays make. It is the one they have always made
</p>
<p>against everybody when they wanted them, and particularly
</p>
<p>against working men, because they want them oftener than
</p>
<p>they do anybody else. (Applause).
</p>
<p>When they want a working man for anything excepting
</p>
<p>work they want him for conspiracy. (Laughter). And the
</p>
<p>greatest conspiracy that is possible for a working man to be
</p>
<p>guilty of is not to work a conspiracy the other fellows are
</p>
<p>always guilty of. (Applause). The conspiracy laws are very
</p>
<p>old. They were very much in favor in the Star Chamber days
</p>
<p>in England. If any king or ruler wanted to get rid of someone,
</p>
<p>and that someone had not done anything, they indicted him
</p>
<p>for what he was thinking about; that is, for conspiracy; and
</p>
<p>under it they could prove anything that he ever said or did,
</p>
<p>and anything that anybody else ever said or did to prove what
</p>
<p>he was thinking about; and therefore that he was guilty. And,
</p>
<p>of course, if anybody was thinking, it was a conspiracy against
</p>
<p>the king; for you can't think without thinking against a king.
</p>
<p>(Applause). The trouble is most people don't think. (Lanki-
</p>
<p>er and appause). And therefore they are not guity of con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. (Laughter and appause).
</p>
<p>The conspiracy laws in England were especialy used
</p>
<p>against working men, and in the early days, not much more
</p>
<p>than a hundred years ago, for one working man to go to an-
</p>
<p>other and suggest that he ask for higher wages was a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, punishable by imprisonment. For a few men to come
</p>
<p>together and form a labor organization in England was a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. It is not here. Even the employer is willing to let you
</p>
<p>form labor organizations, if you don't do anything but pass
</p>
<p>resolutions. (Laughter and applause).
</p>
<p>But the formation of unions in the early days in England
</p>
<p>was a conspiracy, and so they used to meet in the forests and
</p>
<p>in the rocks and in the caves and waste places and hide their
</p>
<p>records in the earth where the informers and detectives and
</p>

</p>
<p>Burnes' men of those days could not get hold of them. CAp-
</p>
<p>plause). It used to be a crime for a working man to leave the
</p>
<p>county without the consent of the employer; and they never
</p>
<p>gave their consent. They were bought and sold with the land.
</p>
<p>Some of them are now. It reached that pass in England after
</p>
<p>labor unions were formed, that anything they did was a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, and to belong to one was practically a criminal offense.
</p>
<p>These laws were not made by Parliament ; of course they were
</p>
<p>not made by the people. No law was ever made by the people ;
</p>
<p>they are made for the people (applause) ; and it does not mat-
</p>
<p>ter whether the people have a right to vote or not, they never
</p>
<p>make the laws. (Applause).
</p>
<p>These laws, however, were made by judges, the same of-
</p>
<p>ficials who make the laws in the United States today. (Ap-
</p>
<p>plause).
</p>
<p>We send men to the Legislature to make law, but they
</p>
<p>don't make them.
</p>
<p>I don't care who makes a law, if you will let me interpret it.
</p>
<p>(Laughter). I would be willing to let the Steel Trust make a
</p>
<p>law if they would let me tell what it meant after they got it
</p>
<p>made. (Laughter). That has been the job of the judges, and
</p>
<p>that is the reason the powerful interests of the world always
</p>
<p>want the courts. They let you have the members of the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature, and the Aldermen and the Constable, if hey can have
</p>
<p>the judges.
</p>
<p>And so in England the judges by their decisions tied the
</p>
<p>working man hand and foot until he was a criminal if he did
</p>
<p>anything but work, as many people think he is today. He
</p>
<p>actually was at that time, until finally Parliament, through the
</p>
<p>revolution of the people, repealed all these laws that judges had
</p>
<p>made, wiped them all out of existence, and did, for a time at
</p>
<p>least, leave the working man free; and then they began to
</p>
<p>organize, and it has gone on to that extent in England today,
</p>
<p>that labor organizations are as firmly established as Parliament

</p>
<p>itself. Much better established there than here.
</p>
<p>We in this country got our early laws from England. We
</p>
<p>took pretty much everything that was bad from England and
</p>
<p>left most that was good. (Applause). At first, when labor
</p>
<p>organizations were started they had a fair chance; they were
</p>
<p>loft comparatively free; but when they began to grow the
</p>
<p>American judges got busy. They got busy with injunctions,
</p>
<p>with conspiracy laws, and there was scarcely anything that a
</p>
<p>labor organization could do that was not an industrial con-
</p>
<p>spiracy.
</p>
<p>Congress took a hand, not against labor; but to illustrate
</p>
<p>what I said about the difference between making a law and
</p>
<p>telling what the law means, we might refer to the act which
</p>
<p>was considered a great law at the time of its passage, a law
</p>
<p>defining conspiracy and combinations in reference to trade, the
</p>
<p>Sherman anti-trust law. In the meantime, the combinations of
</p>
<p>capital had grown so large that even respectable people began
</p>
<p>to be afraid of them, farmers and other who never learn any-
</p>
<p>thing until everybody else has forgotten it (laughter) ; they be-
</p>
<p>gan to be afraid of them. They found the great industrial organi-
</p>
<p>zations of the country controlling everything they used. One
</p>
<p>powerful organization owned all the oil there was in the United
</p>
<p>States; another handful of men owned all the anthracite coal
</p>
<p>there was in the United States; a few men owned all the iron
</p>
<p>mines in the United States ; and the people began to be alarmed
</p>
<p>about it. And so they passed a law punishing conspiracies
</p>
<p>against trade. The father of the law was Senator Sherman of
</p>
<p>Ohio. The law was debated long in Congress and the Senate.
</p>
<p>Every man spoke of it as a law against the trusts and monop-
</p>
<p>olies, conspiracies in restraint of trade and commerce. Every
</p>
<p>newspaper in the country discussed it as that; every labor
</p>
<p>organization so considered it.
</p>
<p>Congress passed it and the President signed it, and then an
</p>
<p>indictment was found against a corporation, and it went to the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of the United States for the Supreme Court to

</p>
<p>say what the law meant. Of course Congress can't pass a law
</p>
<p>that you and I can understand. (Laughter). They may use
</p>
<p>words that are only found in the primer, but we don't know
</p>
<p>what they mean. Nobody but the Supreme Court can tell what
</p>
<p>they mean.
</p>
<p>Everybody supposed this law was plain and simple and
</p>
<p>easily understood, but when they indicted a combination of
</p>
<p>capital for a conspiracy in restraint of trade, the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>said this law did not apply to them at all; that it was never
</p>
<p>meant to fit that particular case. So they tried another one,
</p>
<p>and they indicted another combination engaged in the business
</p>
<p>of cornering markets, engaged in the business of trade, rich
</p>
<p>people, good people. It means the same thing. (Laughter).
</p>
<p>And the Supreme Court decided that this law did not fit their
</p>
<p>case, and every one began to wonder what the law did mean
</p>
<p>anyhow. And after awhile there came along the strike of a
</p>
<p>body of laboring men, the American Railway Union. They
</p>
<p>didn't have a dollar in the world altogether, because they
</p>
<p>were laboring men and they were not engaged in trade; they
</p>
<p>were working; but they hadn't found anything else that the
</p>
<p>Sherman anti-trust act applied to, so they indicted Debs and
</p>
<p>his followers for a conspiracy in restraint of trade; and they
</p>
<p>carried this case to the Supreme Court. I was one of the attor-
</p>
<p>neys who carried it to the Supreme Court, Most lawyers only
</p>
<p>tell you about the cases they win. I can tell you about some I
</p>
<p>lose. (Applause). A lawyer who wins all his cases does not
</p>
<p>have many. (Laughter).
</p>
<p>Debs was indicted for a conspiracy in restraint of trade.
</p>
<p>It is not quite fair to say that I lost that case, because he was
</p>
<p>indicted and fearing he might get out on the indictment the
</p>
<p>judge issued an injunction against him. (Laughter). The facts
</p>
<p>were the same as if a man were suspected of killing somebody
</p>
<p>and a judge would issue an injunction against him for shoot-
</p>

</p>
<p>ing his neighbor and he would kill his neighbor with a pistol
</p>
<p>shot and then they would send him to jail for injuring his
</p>
<p>clothes for violating an injunction. (Laughter). Well, they
</p>
<p>indicted him and they issued an injunction against him for the
</p>
<p>same thing. Of course, we tried the indictment before a jury,
</p>
<p>and that we won. You can generally trust a part of a jury any-
</p>
<p>how, and very often all of them. But the court passed on the
</p>
<p>injunction case, and while the facts were just the same and the
</p>
<p>law was just the same, the jury found him innocent, but the
</p>
<p>court found him guilty. (Laughter). And Judge Wood said
</p>
<p>that he had violated the injunction. Then we carried it to the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court on the ground that the Sherman anti-trust
</p>
<p>law, which was a law to punish conspiracies in restraint of
</p>
<p>trade, was not meant for labor unions but it was meant for
</p>
<p>people who are trading, just as an ordinary common man would
</p>
<p>understand the meaning of language, but the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>said we didn't know anything about the meaning of language
</p>
<p>and that they had at last found what the Sherman anti-trust
</p>
<p>law meant and that it was to break up labor unions; and they
</p>
<p>sent Mr. Debs to jail under that law (laughter and applause),
</p>
<p>and nobody, excepting someone connected with the union had
</p>
<p>ever been sent to jail under that law, and probably never
</p>
<p>will be.
</p>
<p>So of course, even the employer, the Merchants' and Manu-
</p>
<p>facturers' Association and the Steel Trust, even they would
</p>
<p>be willing to let the Socialists go to the Legislature and make
</p>
<p>the laws, as long as they can get the judges to tell what the
</p>
<p>law means. (Loud applause). For the courts are the bulwarks
</p>
<p>of property, property rights and property interests, and they
</p>
<p>always have been. I don't know whether they always will
</p>
<p>be. I suppose they will always be, because before a man can
</p>
<p>be elected a judge he must be a lawyer.
</p>
<p>They did patch up the laws against combinations in re-
</p>
<p>straint of trade. Even the fellows who interpreted it, were
</p>
<p>ashamed of it and they fixed it up so they might catch some-

</p>
<p>body else, and they brought a case against the Tobacco Trust,
</p>
<p>and after long argument and years of delay the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>decided on the Tobacco Trust and they decided that this was a
</p>
<p>combination in restraint of trade, but they didn't send anybody
</p>
<p>to jail. They didn't even fine them. They gave them six
</p>
<p>months not in jail, but six months in which to remodel their
</p>
<p>business so it would conform to the law, which they did. (Ap-
</p>
<p>plause and laughter). But plug tobacco is selling just as high
</p>
<p>as it ever was, and higher.
</p>
<p>They brought an action against the Standard Oil Trust-
</p>
<p>Mr. Koosevelt's enemy. (Laughter and applause). That is
</p>
<p>what he says. (Laughter and applause). They brought an
</p>
<p>action against the Standard Oil Trust to dissolve the Trust
</p>
<p>and they listened patiently for a few years the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>is made up of old men, and they have got lots of time (laugh-
</p>
<p>ter) and after a few years they found out what the people
</p>
<p>had known for twenty -five years, that it was a trust, and they
</p>
<p>so decided that this great corporation had been a conspiracy
</p>
<p>in restraint of trade for years, had been fleecing the American
</p>
<p>people. I don't suppose anybody would have brought an action
</p>
<p>against them, excepting that they had a corner on gasoline
</p>
<p>and the rich people didn't like to pay so much for gasoline to
</p>
<p>run their automobiles. (Laughter and applause). They found
</p>
<p>out that the Standard Oil Company was guilty of a conspiracy
</p>
<p>under the Sherman anti-trust law, and they gave them six
</p>
<p>months in which to change the form of their business, and
</p>
<p>Standard Oil stock today is worth more than it ever was be-
</p>
<p>fore in the history of the world, and gasoline has not been re-
</p>
<p>duced in price, nor anything else that they have to sell. There
</p>
<p>never has been an instance since that law was passed where it
</p>
<p>has ever had the slightest effect upon any combination of
</p>
<p>capital, but under it working men are promptly sent to jail;
</p>
<p>and it was passed to protect the working man and the consumer

</p>
<p>against the trusts of the United States. So, you see, it does not
</p>
<p>make much difference what kind of a law we make as long as
</p>
<p>the judges tell us what it means.
</p>
<p>The Steel Trust has not been hurt. They are allowed to go
</p>
<p>their way, and they have taken property, which at the most,
</p>
<p>is worth three hundred million dollars and have capitalized it
</p>
<p>and bonded it for a billion and a half, or five dolars for every
</p>
<p>one that it represents, and the interests and dividends which
</p>
<p>have been promptly paid year by year have come from the
</p>
<p>toil and the sweat and the life of the American workingman.
</p>
<p>(Applause). And nobody interferes with the Steel Trust; at
</p>
<p>least, nobody but the direct action men. (Laughter and ap-
</p>
<p>plause). The courts are silent, the states' attorneys are silent;
</p>
<p>the governors are silent; all the officers of the law are silent,
</p>
<p>while a great monster combination of crooks and criminals
</p>
<p>are riding rough-shod over the American people. (Ap-
</p>
<p>plause). But it is the working man who is guilty of the indus-
</p>
<p>trial conspiracy. They and their friends are the ones who are
</p>
<p>sent to jail. It is the powerful and the strong who have the
</p>
<p>keys to the jails and the penitentiaries, and there is not much
</p>
<p>danger of their locking themselves in jails and penitentaries.
</p>
<p>The working man never did have the keys. Their business has
</p>
<p>been to build them and to fill them.
</p>
<p>There have been other industrial conspiracies, however,
</p>
<p>which are the ones that interest me most, and it is about these
</p>
<p>and what you can do about them and what you can't do about
</p>
<p>them that I wish to talk tonight.
</p>
<p>The real industrial conspiracies are by the other fellow. It
</p>
<p>is strange that the people who have no property have been
</p>
<p>guilty of all of the industrial conspiracies, and the people who
</p>
<p>own all the earth have not been guilty of any industrial con-
</p>
<p>spiracy. It is like our criminal law. Nearly all the laws are
</p>
<p>made to protect property; nearly all the crimes are crimes
</p>
<p>against property, and yet only the poor go to jail. That is, all
</p>
<p>the people in our jail have committed crimes against property,

<p>and yet they have not got a cent. The people outside have so
</p>
<p>much property they don't know what to do with it, and they
</p>
<p>have committed no crime against property. So with the in-
</p>
<p>dustrial conspiracies, those who are not in trade or commerce
</p>
<p>are the ones who have been guilty of a conspiracy to restrict
</p>
<p>trade and commerce, and those who are in trade and commerce
</p>
<p>that have all the money have not been guilty of anything.
</p>
<p>Their business is prosecuting other people so they can keep
</p>
<p>what they have got and get what little there is left.
</p>
<p>But there are real industrial conspiracies. They began long
</p>
<p>ages ago, and they began by direct action, when the first capi-
</p>
<p>talist took his club and knocked the brains out of somebody
</p>
<p>who wanted a part of it for himself. That is direct action.
</p>
<p>They got the land by direct action. They went out and took
</p>
<p>it. If anybody was there, they drove them off or killed them,
</p>
<p>as the case might be. It is only the other fellow that can't
</p>
<p>have direct action. They got all their title to the earth by
</p>
<p>direct action. Of course, they have swapped it more or less,
</p>
<p>since, but the origin is there. They just went out and took
</p>
<p>possession of it, and it is theirs. And the strong have always
</p>
<p>done it ; they have reached out and taken possession of the
</p>
<p>earth.
</p>
<p>A few men. today can control all the industry and do control
</p>
<p>all of the industry of this country. A dozen men sitting around
</p>
<p>the table in a big city can bring famine if they wish ; they can
</p>
<p>paralyze the wheels of industry from one end of the United
</p>
<p>States to the other, and the prosperity of villages, cities and
</p>
<p>towns, and the wages of its people depends almost entirely
</p>
<p>upon the wills of a dozen men.
</p>
<p>They have taken the mines ; and all the coal there is in the
</p>
<p>United States, or practically all, is controlled today by a few
</p>
<p>rairoad companies who can tell us just what we must pay, and
</p>
<p>if we are not willing to pay it, we can freeze ; and we respect
</p>
<p>private property so much that we will stand around and freeze

<p>rather than take the coal that nature placed in the earth for
</p>
<p>all mankind. (Applause).
</p>
<p>All the iron ore in the United States that is worth taking is
</p>
<p>owned and controlled by the Steel Trust, one combination with
</p>
<p>a very few men managing the business ; not more than a half a
</p>
<p>dozen absolutely controlling it have their will ; and nobody can
</p>
<p>have any iron ore, or mold it or use it, excepting at the will of
</p>
<p>a few men who have taken possession of what nature placed
</p>
<p>there for all of us, if we were wise enough to use it and under-
</p>
<p>stand it. And the great forests of the United States, what is
</p>
<p>left of them and there is not so very much left. We are a
</p>
<p>wise people. We pass laws now for the protection of timber in
</p>
<p>the United States, so it won't be destroyed too fast, and at
</p>
<p>the same time, we put a tariff duty of two dollars a thousand
</p>
<p>on lumber that comes from somewhere else so that it will be
</p>
<p>destroyed at a high price. (Laughter and applause). We are
</p>
<p>the wisest set of people of any land that the sun ever shone
</p>
<p>upon. And if you don't believe it, ask Koosevelt when he
</p>
<p>comes here. (Laughter and applause).
</p>
<p>A few men control what is left of the forests, a few men
</p>
<p>and a few great corporations have taken the earth, what is
</p>
<p>good of it. They have left the arid lands, the desert and the
</p>
<p>mountains which nobody can use, the desert for sand heaps
</p>
<p>and the mountains for scenery. They are now taxing the
</p>
<p>people to build reservoirs so that the desert will blossom; and
</p>
<p>after it begins to blossom, they will take that. (Applause).
</p>
<p>And even if they didn't own the land, they own all the ways
</p>
<p>there are of getting to it, and they are able to take from the
</p>
<p>farmer just so much of his grain as they see fit to take, and so
</p>
<p>far as the farmer is concerned, I wish they would take it all
</p>
<p>(laughter and applause), because he always has been against
</p>
<p>the interests of every man that toils, including himself. (Ap-
</p>
<p>plause). And they are able to say to the working man engaged
</p>
<p>in industry just how much of his product they will take, and

<p>from him they take just enough to leave him alive. They have
</p>
<p>got to leave him alive, or he can't work, and they have got to
</p>
<p>leave him enough strength and ambition to propagate his
</p>
<p>species or the rich people can't get their work done in the next
</p>
<p>generation. And that is all that they are bound to leave him.
</p>
<p>They own the railroads, the mills, the factories, and all the
</p>
<p>tools and implements of trade and commerce, and the work-
</p>
<p>ingman has ony one thing to sell. That is his labor, his life ;
</p>
<p>and he has to sell that to the highest bidder.
</p>
<p>There are only a few of these men who own the earth and
</p>
<p>all of its fullness. There are millions and millions of the people
</p>
<p>who do the work, and if you can keep these millions and mil-
</p>
<p>lions disorganized and competing with each other, they will
</p>
<p>keep wages down themselves without any help from the bosses.
</p>
<p>(Laud applause). On the other hand, there are so few men
</p>
<p>who own the earth and the tools that they find it perfectly easy
</p>
<p>to combine with each other and regulate the price of their
</p>
<p>products, and they have learned better than to compete, and
</p>
<p>there is no way for the wit of man to make and interpret any
</p>
<p>law which will ever set them to competing again. They have
</p>
<p>managed to control the price of their products, and charge
</p>
<p>what they see fit and all they need is to buy their raw material
</p>
<p>in the open markets of the world as cheaply as they can, and
</p>
<p>labor is the principal raw material that they use. So of course
</p>
<p>they want free trade in labor, and protection in commodities;
</p>
<p>and they have always had it, and our wise Americans that are
</p>
<p>the marvel of the day, including the working people, have
</p>
<p>cheerfully given them protection in the commodities that they
</p>
<p>sell and free trade in the labor which they buy. (Applause).
</p>
<p>And they thought by protecting the Steel ^Trust, so there can't
</p>
<p>be any foreign competition that it will make the Steel Trust
</p>
<p>so rich that they can afford to pay high prices to their work-

</p>
<p>ing men. It is one thing to make a man rich enough so he can
</p>
<p>afford to pay high wages ; it is another thing to make him pay.
</p>
<p>(Laughter).
</p>
<p>So the employer and the capitalist have combined in all in-
</p>
<p>dustry, and they fix the price to suit themselves and insist
</p>
<p>that the workingman shall come to them individually and
</p>
<p>unorganized and compete with each other for a day's labor,
</p>
<p>so they can buy labor at the smallest cost and if, perchance,
</p>
<p>there are not working men enough here, they want the ports
</p>
<p>of the world opened so they can draw on China or Japan or
</p>
<p>any other country on the face of the earth, and get working
</p>
<p>men there to work for them at the smallest price.
</p>
<p>The game is simple and easy. It seems as if it were simple
</p>
<p>enough for an American farmer to understand; but he doesn't.
</p>
<p>(Laughter).
</p>
<p>Now, the original conspiracy, industrial conspiracy, has
</p>
<p>been on the part of the strong to take the earth, and they have
</p>
<p>got it. They own it, and all they need now is to get enough
</p>
<p>working men and women at a low enough price to make them
</p>
<p>as much wealth as they want. It is pretty hard to fill that
</p>
<p>market, they want so much ; but that is all they need. And the
</p>
<p>conspiracy on the other side of the workingman of the United
</p>
<p>States is the same conspiracy as the conspiracy of the work-
</p>
<p>ingman of the world, and it has only one object. "We may
</p>
<p>temporize; we may be content with a little; we may stop at
</p>
<p>half measures, but in the end it only has one object, and that is
</p>
<p>for the workers of the world to take back the earth that has
</p>
<p>been taken from us. (Cries of hurrah and loud cheering).
</p>
<p>Take it back, and have all the products of their toil, not
</p>
<p>part of it, but all of it. Now, it is a long road. It is a univer-
</p>
<p>sal, world-wide conspiracy by the intelligent working people
</p>
<p>and by their friends the world over to get back the earth that
</p>
<p>has been stolen by direct action. (Applause).
</p>
<p>Now, no one who understands this question wants anything
</p>
<p>less and the employer is right when he says if workingmen are
</p>

<p>permitted to organize they won't stop with that; and they
</p>
<p>won't. (Applause). You may place every lawyer on the bench
</p>
<p>and you may place a jail in every block and a penitentiary in
</p>
<p>every ward, and the workingmen won't stop. (Applause).
</p>
<p>If they will, they deserve to be workingmen forever. Applause).
</p>
<p>The employer understands that if workingmen organize
</p>
<p>something will be doing ; and so he does not believe in organi-
</p>
<p>zation. Sometimes he says he does, but he does not. If work-
</p>
<p>ingmen must organize, then the thing is to keep them as quiet
</p>
<p>as they can, to turn their labor meetings into prayer meetings.
</p>
<p>(Laughter and applause). They are entirely harmless. They
</p>
<p>don't help the people who pray, and the Lord has always been
</p>
<p>so far away from the workingman that it doesn't bother Him
</p>
<p>either. (Laughter). They are willing even, as I have said,
</p>
<p>to let them pass resolutions, but that is about the limit.
</p>
<p>(Laughter). They understand that one thing leads to another,
</p>
<p>and if they concede higher wages today, next year they will
</p>
<p>want another raise and so they will. There is no danger of
</p>
<p>raising it too high for a long while to come. And if they con-
</p>
<p>cede shorter hours today, next year they may want them
</p>
<p>shorter still. Everybody is working for shorter hours, especial-
</p>
<p>ly the people who don't work. And they are all working for
</p>
<p>bigger pay; even those who get all there is, they want more.
</p>
<p>And of course, there will be no stopping, there will be no end
</p>
<p>to the demand, until we get it all, and that is a long way off.
</p>
<p>And the question is how? And that is not so easy. It is
</p>
<p>easier to tell how you can't get it than to tell how you can
</p>
<p>get it. It is easier to tell how you haven't got it than how you
</p>
<p>are going to get it.
</p>
<p>There is another thing that they are fairly well satisfied
</p>
<p>with: They don't worry much about voting. They have
</p>
<p>been satisfied to let all the men vote, and they have still kept
</p>
<p>their property. (Laughter). They will be satisfied to let all
</p>
<p>the women vote, and they will still keep their property. Voting

</p>
<p>more than a hundred years, and it is a nice little toy to keep
</p>
<p>people satisfied, but that is all it has done so far. (Applause).
</p>
<p>Of course, here and there we have been able to pass a few
</p>
<p>laws. For instance, we have statutes which forbid women
</p>
<p>from working in a factory more than ten hours a day. (Laugh-
</p>
<p>ter). Now, we have done something. (Laughter and applause).
</p>
<p>We have statutes forbidding men to labor more than a certain
</p>
<p>number of hours a day. That is, people like to work; they love
</p>
<p>it so dearly that you have to pass a law to keep a working man
</p>
<p>from working. (Laughter).
</p>
<p>When we pass laws to keep men and women from work i ML:
</p>
<p>it ought to show the stupidest mind that there is something
</p>
<p>terribly wrong with the industrial conditions under which we
</p>
<p>live. If men had a chance to work and get all the proceeds
</p>
<p>of their work, you would not have to pass laws to keep them
</p>
<p>from working. They would stop soon enough. And if every
</p>
<p>man could employ his own labor and receive the full product
</p>
<p>of his toil it would make no difference how hard you neighbor
</p>
<p>worked, it would not hurt you in the least, and you could let
</p>
<p>him work himself to death if he wanted to.
</p>
<p>The only difficulty is under the patch work industrial sys-
</p>
<p>tem of today where a few men own all the earth, and all the
</p>
<p>factories and mills and are compelled to sell their product to
</p>
<p>the workingman, they give him such a small share of that
</p>
<p>product that the workingmen haven't anything to buy it with.
</p>
<p>They can't buy it back, and so there is not work enough to go
</p>
<p>around. And for that reason we are tinkering up this old
</p>
<p>system of laws to keep people from working, and we pass a
</p>
<p>law to limit the number of hours that a man can work and to
</p>
<p>limit the number of hours that a woman can work, and to limit
</p>
<p>the age at which a little child can be fed into a factory or a
</p>
<p>mill.
</p>
<p>Do you suppose that the fatherhood and the motherhood of

</p>
<p>the people of the United States is not of a high enough grade
</p>
<p>so they would not send their children to a factory or a mill if
</p>
<p>there was any way to avoid it? And do you think under
</p>
<p>any fair system of industry and life we would ever need a law
</p>
<p>to keep a child out of a factory or a mill? (Applause).
</p>
<p>We have managed to pass some laws to require safety ap-
</p>
<p>pliances in factories and in mills and upon railroads. For in-
</p>
<p>stance, to put a guard on a buzz saw so that a workingman won 't
</p>
<p>saw his hand instead of sawing the wood. (Laughter). But
</p>
<p>if a workingman had any chance to employ his labor and get
</p>
<p>Avhat he produced he would not be fooling with a buzz saw and
</p>
<p>there would be no need of it and he would look out for the
</p>
<p>safety of the machines himself and do it a great deal better
</p>
<p>than the Government ever did it or can ever possibly do it.
</p>
<p>(Applause). So we have done everything and tried everything,
</p>
<p>excepting to strike at the root of any evil and accomplish
</p>
<p>something of real value. We have even passed laws excluding
</p>
<p>the Chinaman and the Jap from the United States. That is,
</p>
<p>we love our own people so dearly that we won't let the China-
</p>
<p>man or the Jap do the work for them. (Laughter). We want
</p>
<p>our people to have all the work, and if they come here and
</p>
<p>volunteer to do it we won't let them; for work is a blessing
</p>
<p>under the present industrial system. We have to work. If
</p>
<p>we stop we starve.
</p>
<p>Now, I could imagine a system, and it seems to me that
</p>
<p>most all of you could imagine a system that was so fair and so
</p>
<p>just and so equal that if any body df philanthropic heathens
</p>
<p>would agree to come over here and do our work for us, we
</p>
<p>would go and play golf or run automobiles whilst they were
</p>
<p>doing it ; but with a condition of life where a few men have it
</p>
<p>all and the rest can only live if they have the work to do, why
</p>
<p>no one can do it for us; we have got to do it ourselves. We
</p>
<p>can't even allow a machine to do it, for every time we get the
</p>
<p>machine to do the work it takes the place of a man or two, or

<p>more, and they go out to beg or tramp or starve, as the case
</p>
<p>may be.
</p>
<p>"We have got a wonderful system of industry, and industrial
</p>
<p>life. If anybody ever invented it, which they didn't, he must
</p>
<p>have been standing on his head and drunken at the time he did
</p>
<p>it. (Laughter and applause).
</p>
<p>And now what are we going to do about it? We have the
</p>
<p>great mass of men living upon the will of a few and taking
</p>
<p>what they can get, and we have got to get back the earth. A
</p>
<p>small job. Some people would say, "Well, if you have got to
</p>
<p>get it back why don't you go and take it?" Well, we don't.
</p>
<p>Some people say we have got to vote it back, and some say we
</p>
<p>have got to get it back through labor organizations, and some
</p>
<p>say we have got to have a good deal more than that.
</p>
<p>I don't know. But I want to say some things about political
</p>
<p>action. If we are going to get at it in that way we first had
</p>
<p>better understand the size of the contract, and there are a
</p>
<p>great many people who don't. (Applause).
</p>
<p>We have been voting a long time, and we have a democracy.
</p>
<p>Everybody can vote every man past twenty-one. If we are
</p>
<p>not doing well enough we are going to let the women vote;
</p>
<p>then if we don't do any better we will let the children vote,
</p>
<p>and then we will get somewhere. (Applause). If we are going
</p>
<p>to get out of this muss by voting, why, let's have a little of it.
</p>
<p>We had better have an election every day, because' if we can
</p>
<p>do it that way it is about the simplest there is. But we have
</p>
<p>been working at it a long while and we are getting in worse
</p>
<p>all the time.
</p>
<p>In the first place, how many of us understand our system
</p>
<p>of government? We hear people talk about it on the Fourth
</p>
<p>day of July, and they run for an office in the fall. The most
</p>
<p>glorious system ever invented by the wit of man !
</p>
<p>I want to say th.it it is about the craziest system that was
</p>
<p>ever conceived in the brain of man. (Applause).

</p>
<p>Our system of government never was conceived in the brain
</p>
<p>of man, because no man or combination of men were ever
</p>
<p>foolish enough and weak enough to conceive them. It is a
</p>
<p>system of blunders. If you would elect for the next hundred
</p>
<p>years a president as wise as Roosevelt (laughter and applause)
</p>
<p>you could not move a peg.
</p>
<p>Let me just tell yon why. Suppose we want to pass a law.
</p>
<p>As I have said, we pass little fool laws and nobody pays much
</p>
<p>attention to them. They don't hurt anybody and they let them
</p>
<p>go. But suppose we want to pass a law of substance, if there
</p>
<p>is any such thing as a law of substance; suppose we want to
</p>
<p>do it, something affecting fundamental rights, now how are we
</p>
<p>going to get at it ?
</p>
<p>One hundred and twenty-five years ago and more a body
</p>
<p>of men, very wise for their day and generation, met to form
</p>
<p>the constitution. They had just been indulging in a little
</p>
<p>direct action against England. (Laughter). They could have
</p>
<p>sent members to Parliament up to now and we would have still
</p>
<p>been British subjects. I don't know as we would have been
</p>
<p>any worse off if we had been. But they got at it simply and
</p>
<p>directly, and so they won our American independence. I don't
</p>
<p>know just when it was lost, but they won it. (Applause). And
</p>
<p>the first thing they did was to have a constitution.
</p>
<p>You can' do anything without a constitution. You have got
</p>
<p>to have a good constitution to get anywhere.
</p>
<p>And so they got together a body of men, John Hancock and
</p>
<p>some more penmen, and they wrote a constitution.
</p>
<p>Now, what is a constitution ? Why, it is just the same as if
</p>
<p>a boy, twenty-one years of age, would say, "Well, now, I have
</p>
<p>become of age, and I am wise, and I am going to write out a
</p>
<p>constitution to cover the rest of my life, and when I am forty
</p>
<p>I can't do anything that is unconstitutional."
</p>
<p>There wasn't a railroad one hundred and twenty-five years
</p>
<p>ago; there wasn't a steam engine; there wasn't a flying ma-

</p>
<p>chine, of course, nor an automobile. Nobody knew anything
</p>
<p>about electricity, except what came down from the clouds and
</p>
<p>they were busy dodging it. There were few machines; there
</p>
<p>was just a body of farmers that's all. (Laughter and ap-
</p>
<p>plause). And they wrote the constitution, and there it is. It
</p>
<p>didn't apply to the industrial conditions of today, for they
</p>
<p>didn't know anything about the industrial conditions of today,
</p>
<p>but they imagined that they were so wise that lest people one
</p>
<p>hundred and twenty-five years later should think they knew
</p>
<p>more they would tie things up so that we could not make a fool
</p>
<p>of ourselves, to the third or fourth generation after they were
</p>
<p>dead. (Laughter). And so they wrote down a constitution
</p>
<p>which meant that whatever the American people wanted to do
</p>
<p>a hundred, or two hundred, or five hundred years afterward,
</p>
<p>they could not do it unless it agreed with the constitution that
</p>
<p>had already been written down or unless they changed it.
</p>
<p>Well now, that was a wise piece of business so far, wasn't
</p>
<p>it? But that is only the beginning of it.
</p>
<p>Then they organized this government into separate states.
</p>
<p>I don't know how many there are now, they are hatching some
</p>
<p>new ones all the while. But every state was independent in a
</p>
<p>way. and in a way it was united with all the rest. Nobody
</p>
<p>knows just how much independence there is and how much
</p>
<p>union there is. Nobody knows but the judges, and they only
</p>
<p>know in the particular case. They can say this goes or this
</p>
<p>does not go; nobody can tell until they get there. (Laughter).
</p>
<p>What comes within the state province and what comes within
</p>
<p>the national province nobody knows, nor ever did know. The
</p>
<p>states are individual and separate to make laws for them-
</p>
<p>selves. Each one of them has a law factory of their own, and
</p>
<p>they are all busy; and the United States Government has an-
</p>
<p>other big law factory, and they have all been grinding out laws
</p>
<p>for a hundred years and not only that but the courts have

</p>
<p>been telling us what they mean and what they don't mean; so
</p>
<p>it has been pretty busy for the lawyer.
</p>
<p>Then they decided that they should have a congress, which
</p>
<p>consisted of the senate, where men were selected for six years,
</p>
<p>not by the people but by state legislatures, and a congress
</p>
<p>where men were elected for two years by the people. But these
</p>
<p>congressmen elected for two yaers didn't take their seat for a
</p>
<p>year after they were elected, and time to forget all about the
</p>
<p>issue on which they were elected. (Laughter). And not
</p>
<p>satisfied with that, they had to have a Supreme Court to tell
</p>
<p>us what congress or the senate meant, and the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>was appointed for life and not beholden to anybody; and they
</p>
<p>are generally about a hundred years old apiece. (Laughter).
</p>
<p>And then they had a president, who was elected for four years,
</p>
<p>and who had a right to veto anything that congress and the
</p>
<p>senate saw fit to pass, and if he voted it you could not pass it
</p>
<p>except by a two-thirds majority of both houses. And there you
</p>
<p>have got it, so far as the United States Government is con-
</p>
<p>cerned. But that is not nearly all.
</p>
<p>So if you want to pass some important law, let's see what
</p>
<p>you have to do. Of course, little laws don't count, for you
</p>
<p>can't keep up a factory unless you do something, pass laws
</p>
<p>one year and repeal them the next, or some little thing like
</p>
<p>that, to save the job. But take an important thing, an issue com-
</p>
<p>ing up from the people, one ultimately meaning the taking of
</p>
<p>the earth. Nothing else is important. It may be in one form
</p>
<p>or another, but it must have that purpose, or it won't be im-
</p>
<p>portant, because you can't regulate things that belong to other
</p>
<p>people very successfully; you have got to get it yourselves.
</p>
<p>(Applause). Now, let's see what you have got to do.
</p>
<p>In the first place, you must elect a congress, and the con-
</p>
<p>gress does not take its seat for a year after they are elected ;
</p>
<p>and then they run up against the United States senate, holding
</p>
<p>six year terms, and one-third of them passing away each two

</p>
<p>years, none of them elected upon the issue upon which congress
</p>
<p>were elected, mostly old men and generally rich men rich
</p>
<p>enough to get the job. (Laughter). Now you have got to get
</p>
<p>the law through congress and through the senate both, which
</p>
<p>is well nigh impossible, if it is a law of any consequence. And
</p>
<p>then here comes a president, who is elected by the people for
</p>
<p>four years, and he must sign it, and if congress and the senate
</p>
<p>or the president refuses, then you can't do it. Excepting if
</p>
<p>the president refuses then you have got to get two-thirds of
</p>
<p>both the houses, which is impossible if the law amounts to any-
</p>
<p>thing, and then you have only begun. If you should happen
</p>
<p>to get all these three at once, which we never did and never
</p>
<p>will on anything very important because the claws are all cut
</p>
<p>out of any bill before it ever gets very far, then you have only
</p>
<p>begun. Then here is this document, this sacred document
</p>
<p>which came down from Mount Sinai one hundred and twenty-
</p>
<p>five years ago, The Constitution, and you lay down the law
</p>
<p>beside the Constitution and see whether it is unconstitutional
</p>
<p>or not and of course you could not tell. You would not know
</p>
<p>anything about it. Congress could not tell; the senate could
</p>
<p>not tell ; the president coud not tell. There is only one tribunal
</p>
<p>that could tell, and that is the Supreme Court. And whlie the
</p>
<p>Constitution fills about ten pages, the interpretation of the
</p>
<p>Constitution will fill a hundred volumes or more. (Laughter).
</p>
<p>And the Constitution is not what is written in ten pages
</p>
<p>but it is what is written in the decisions of the judges covering
</p>
<p>over a hundred years; and they don't always agree, at that,
</p>
<p>which makes some of them right. If they all agreed probably
</p>
<p>none of them would be right. (Laughter).
</p>
<p>So if you should ever succeed in getting a law past congress
</p>
<p>with its two year term, and the senate with its six, and the
</p>
<p>president with his four,, anyone of whom may block it, and
</p>
<p>will, if it is important, then you have got to pass it to these
</p>
<p>wise judges who are not elected at all and who have no in-

<p>terests with the people because they are holding their office for
</p>
<p>life and they have been there so long and got so old that they
</p>
<p>don't understand any of the new qoestions anyhow, and could
</p>
<p>not, and who have the conservatism of age anyway, and they
</p>
<p>have got to decide whether that law is constitutional or not,
</p>
<p>and before they have decided it and before it has run the
</p>
<p>gauntlet of all of them, even if they decided it right you would
</p>
<p>not need the law. The law would be dead. (Laughter). But
</p>
<p>you must combine on all these four things before you can ac-
</p>
<p>complish anything.
</p>
<p>And that is not all. Then you must decide whether the law
</p>
<p>is within the province of the state or the nation ; whether it is
</p>
<p>state business or whether it is national business ; and most of
</p>
<p>our laws are state laws and when we get back to the state we
</p>
<p>find the same old story. Wonderful wisdom ! Here is first a
</p>
<p>constitution, which is nothing except as I illustrated, a boy
</p>
<p>twenty-one years old swears he won't know any more when he
</p>
<p>is fifty, and that kind of a boy generally does not. (Laughter).
</p>
<p>And we have a legislative body to make laws, composed of a
</p>
<p>house and a senate, two bodies, one not being wise enough to
</p>
<p>make them themselves ; and we have a governor with a veto,
</p>
<p>and a Supreme Court to say whether the law is constitutional
</p>
<p>or not. The same thing in the state and the same thing in the
</p>
<p>nation. Then we have got to see whether it is in the province
</p>
<p>of the nation or the state, and you see it is next to impossible
</p>
<p>to ever get a constitutional law that amounts to anything, and
</p>
<p>we have never done it.
</p>
<p>But, they say, this is a country where people vote, and if
</p>
<p>you don't like the law, why change it. If you didn't vote there
</p>
<p>would be some excuse for direct action, but as long as you vote
</p>
<p>you can change the law. (Applause). The trouble is you can't
</p>
<p>change it. You haven't got a chance. How can you change
</p>
<p>one of these laws that are important ? How can you appeal to
</p>
<p>the people, first of all, and change it with the people? And

<p>next, how could you possibly elect a congress and a senate and
</p>
<p>a president and a Supreme Court all at once, that ever would
</p>
<p>make any substantial change, or ever did?
</p>
<p>"Well," they say, "if the Constitution fetters you too
</p>
<p>much, why, change the Constitution. The Constitution provides
</p>
<p>that it can be changed." And so it does; but how?
</p>
<p>You can change the Constitution of the United States. You
</p>
<p>could change Mt. Hood, but it would take a pile of shovels.
</p>
<p>(Laughter). You could change Mt. Hood a good deal easier.
</p>
<p>It could be done. The law provides that if you pass a law
</p>
<p>through congress and the senate and it is signed by the presi-
</p>
<p>dent, to change the Constitution, you may submit it to the
</p>
<p>people and if three-fourths of all the states in the Union con-
</p>
<p>sent to it, why you can change it. What do you think of that ?
</p>
<p>Do you suppose there is any power on earth that ever could
</p>
<p>get a law through congress and the senate, approved by the
</p>
<p>senate, and then get three-fourths of the individual states in the
</p>
<p>Union to approve it? You and your children and your chil-
</p>
<p>dren's children would die while you are doing it.
</p>
<p>The best proof of that is the fact that we have had a con-
</p>
<p>stitution for one hundred and twenty-five years, and the Lord
</p>
<p>knows it needs patching. It needs something worse : It needs
</p>
<p>abolishing worse than anything else. (Applause).
</p>
<p>If anybody does want to tinker with voting the first thing
</p>
<p>necessary is to get rid of the constitution. We have had one
</p>
<p>for a hundred and twenty-five years with a provision for
</p>
<p>changing it. It has needed change. It needs it all the while,
</p>
<p>and yet it has never been changed but once. They passed
</p>
<p>several amendments all in a heap. What were those? Those
</p>
<p>were amendments growing out of the Civil War, and they
</p>
<p>didn't permit any of the Southern States to vote. They just
</p>
<p>ran them over their heads, and they were all amendments pro-
</p>
<p>tecting the negroes after enfranchisement. And those are the
</p>
<p>only amendments we have had in one hundred and twenty-five

<p>years, and it took a war to get those considerable direct
</p>
<p>action.
</p>
<p>"Why, if a body of ingenious men had gotten together to
</p>
<p>make the frame work of a government to absolutely take from
</p>
<p>the people all the power they possibly could, they could not
</p>
<p>have contrived anything more mischievous and complete than
</p>
<p>our American form of government. (Applause).
</p>
<p>Russia is easy and simple compared with this. If you did
</p>
<p>happen to get a progressive, kindly, sympathetic, humane
</p>
<p>Czar, which you probably won't, but if you did you could
</p>
<p>change all the laws of Russia and you could change them right
</p>
<p>away and get something. But if you got the wisest and kindest
</p>
<p>and most sympathetic man on earth at the head of our govern-
</p>
<p>ment he could not do anything; or if you filled congress with
</p>
<p>them they could not do anything, or the senate they could not,
</p>
<p>and the Supreme Court could not. You would have to fill them
</p>
<p>all at once, and then they would have to override all the pre-
</p>
<p>cedents of a hundred and twenty-five years to accomplish it.
</p>
<p>The English Government is simplicity itself compared to it.
</p>
<p>As compared with ours it is as direct as a convention of the
</p>
<p>I. W. W. (Applause). The English people elect a Parliament
</p>
<p>and when some demand comes up from the country for dif-
</p>
<p>ferent legislation which reaches Parliament and is strong
</p>
<p>enough to demand a division in Parliament and the old majority
</p>
<p>fails, Parliament is dissolved at once, and you go right straight
</p>
<p>back to the people and elect a new Parliament upon that issue
</p>
<p>and they go at once to Parliament and pass a law, and there is
</p>
<p>no power on earth that can stop them. The king hasn't any
</p>
<p>more to say about the laws of England, nor any more power
</p>
<p>than a floor manager of a charity ball would have to say about
</p>
<p>it. He is just an ornament, and not much of an ornament at
</p>
<p>that. (Applause). The House of Lords is comparatively help-
</p>
<p>less, and they never had any constitution ; there never was any
</p>
<p>power in England to set aside any law that the people made.

</p>
<p>It was the law, plain and direct and simple, and you might get
</p>
<p>somewhere with it. But we have built up a machine that
</p>
<p>destroys every person who undertakes to touch it. I don't
</p>
<p>know how you are ever going to remedy it. Nothing short of
</p>
<p>a political revolution, which would be about as complete as the
</p>
<p>Deluge, could ever change our laws under our present system
</p>
<p>(applause) in any important particular.
</p>
<p>But while anybody is voting they had better vote the right
</p>
<p>way if they can find it out. If they can't it is just as well not to
</p>
<p>vote. They had better vote for some workingman's candidate
</p>
<p>and be counted as long as you are doing it. (Applause). Still
</p>
<p>any benefit that must come anywhere in the near future must
</p>
<p>come some other way. Workingmen have not raised their wages
</p>
<p>by it; they haven't shortened their hours of toil by it; they
</p>
<p>haven't improved the conditions of life by it; it has all been
</p>
<p>done in some other way. All of this has been accomplished by
</p>
<p>trades-unionism, by organization. If you can organize work-
</p>
<p>ingmen sufficiently so that they may make their demands
</p>
<p>strong strong enough you can accomplish something in all of
</p>
<p>these directions. (Applause). But our political institutions
</p>
<p>are such that before you could get anything like a political
</p>
<p>revolution you need an industrial revolution. (Applause).
</p>
<p>And then we come to face some of the problems of today,
</p>
<p>and I want to speak a little bit about that. I have talked to
</p>
<p>you about as long as I ought to tonight, but I want to say
</p>
<p>something about some matters that perhaps are closer home
</p>
<p>than those.
</p>
<p>We find the American workingman bound by the law, as
</p>
<p>I have said, everything taken from him. He can't do any-
</p>
<p>thing by voting. The courts are almost always against him,
</p>
<p>for the simple reason that courts are made from lawyers, gen-
</p>
<p>erally prominent lawyers and well known lawyers. In almost
</p>
<p>every instance these lawyers have been corporation lawyers.
</p>
<p>Their instincts are that way. Their beliefs are that w r ay, and

<p>their training and heredity are that way; and they are not
</p>
<p>with the poor.
</p>
<p>In order" to be a lawyer you must spend considerable time,
</p>
<p>if not studying, at least you must spend it not working. You
</p>
<p>can't work while you are becoming a lawyer, and you won't
</p>
<p>work afterwards. (Laughter). It takes eight or ten years'
</p>
<p>schooling at least. That is one reason why a lawyer says he
</p>
<p>should have big fees, it takes him so long to learn the trade.
</p>
<p>That is, the poor people support a lawyer so long while he is
</p>
<p>preparing that they ought to support him better while he is
</p>
<p>practicing (laughter) ; because a fellow studying to! be a
</p>
<p>lawyer, or a doctor, or a minister I don't know what they
</p>
<p>study to be a minister, but I suppose they do (laughter) has
</p>
<p>got to be living while he is studying and somebody must take
</p>
<p>care of him ; to take care of him while he is learning after
</p>
<p>he gets it learned he takes care of himself.
</p>
<p>So the judges are not on your side. They don't look at
</p>
<p>things the way you do. They are trained differently. If they
</p>
<p>were picked out of your trade councils they would look at
</p>
<p>them differently and they could decide cases differently.
</p>
<p>Everything is in habit, and the environment and the training,
</p>
<p>and they are all the time fashioning the law against you.
</p>
<p>Then what? Workingmen find themselves hedged about
</p>
<p>wherever they turn. They can't employ themselves. Some-
</p>
<p>body has got the earth. They can't mine ore; somebody owns
</p>
<p>it. They can't get the steel to do the work with themselves;
</p>
<p>they have got to buy it of somebody. They can't do the work
</p>
<p>except for wages; the employer does it and the employer in-
</p>
<p>sists upon open competition in labor and workingmen are con-
</p>
<p>stantly fighting each other.
</p>
<p>Everybody admits that the systems must change, that the
</p>
<p>laws must change. They can't change them by political action,
</p>
<p>and the injustice goes on, and on, and on.

<p>and mills; their children, not the children of. the rich but the
</p>
<p>children of the poor. The rich love their children so much
</p>
<p>that they don't put them in factories and mills.' Only the
</p>
<p>children of the poor are put in factories and mills, which shows
</p>
<p>that mother love is not the same with poor people as it is with
</p>
<p>rich people. Still the poor people have all the children any-
</p>
<p>way, so there are enough. (Laughter). They are good to the
</p>
<p>rich and they have the chidren for them.
</p>
<p>They find that the life of a poor man is only about two-
</p>
<p>thirds as long as that of a rich man. A man dies because he
</p>
<p>is poor. A lawyer, or preacher or a doctor can take care of
</p>
<p>himself; but the workingman dies because he is poor. Lots
</p>
<p>of gray-headed lawyers and preachers and bankers and doc-
</p>
<p>tors, but there are not so very many gray-haired working-
</p>
<p>men. That is lucky for them, too, because they would have to
</p>
<p>go to the poor house. (Laughter). Maybe they will get old
</p>
<p>age pensions sometimes. (Applause). It is always safe and
</p>
<p>economical to give workingmen old age pensions, because they
</p>
<p>never reach old age. They find themselves ground up by all
</p>
<p>kinds of machinery, ground to death under car wheels, sawed
</p>
<p>to pieces in factories and mills, falling from ten and twelve
</p>
<p>story buildings, picked up oe the ground just one big spatter
</p>
<p>of blood and bones. They know these conditions are wrong
</p>
<p>and they can't change them, and the people who have control
</p>
<p>of it are squeezing them tighter and and tighter all the time
</p>
<p>and they don't know which way to turn. And which way do
</p>
<p>they turn? They try voting. They don't accomplish it. They
</p>
<p>try organization, and that is hard. They try direct action, and
</p>
<p>that is hard, too. You wonder that they try it.
</p>
<p>Now, a great many people condemned the McNamaras. A
</p>
<p>great many working people condemned them. I don't say
</p>
<p>that the working people ever need to resort to force, or ever
</p>
<p>should resort to force, but it is not for me to condemn anybody

<p>who believes they should. (Applause).
</p>
<p>I know that the progress of the human race is one long
</p>
<p>bloody story of force and violence (applause) ; and from the
</p>
<p>time man got up on his hind legs and looked the world in the
</p>
<p>face he has been fighting, and fighting, and fighting for all
</p>
<p>the liberty and the opportunity that he has had. I think the
</p>
<p>time will come when he can stop. Perhaps it has come. And
</p>
<p>no one hates cruelty and force and violence more than I hate
</p>
<p>it. But don't let them ever tell you that all the force has
</p>
<p>been on our side. (Loud applause). It never has been; most
</p>
<p>all of it has been with them. (Applause). They are the ones
</p>
<p>who have the force, who have the power.
</p>
<p>Why are these standing armies and navies; and, more than
</p>
<p>that, the militia building their armories in every great city in
</p>
<p>the United States? Are they there for a foreign foe or are they
</p>
<p>there to shoot strikers and workingmen when the time shall
</p>
<p>come? (Loud applause). Are they there to protect the people
</p>
<p>from China and Japan and England, or are they there to
</p>
<p>protect property against the poor? (Loud and prolonged ap-
</p>
<p>plause).
</p>
<p>What is a lockout in a factory or mill when they call it
</p>
<p>famine and want and hunger and cold, to do their work? Is
</p>
<p>that force, or is it peace and quietness and gentleness, and the
</p>
<p>Golden Rule?
</p>
<p>What are the policemen, what are the officers of the law,
</p>
<p>what is the machinery of government directed against the
</p>
<p>workingmen, holding all the resources of the earth in the
</p>
<p>power of a few and compelling the money to go to those few
</p>
<p>for the means of life? Isn't this force?
</p>
<p>What is the blacklist? Is it anything but force that drives
</p>
<p>children into the factories, that drives women into factories,
</p>
<p>and compels men to work with defective machinery for long
</p>
<p>hours and poor wages? Is it anything but the force of strva-
</p>
<p>tion and want that has always been used by the owners of the
</p>
<p>earth to make the poor do their bidding and their will?

<p>The force is there. It is not with the weak. The weak
</p>
<p>have never had the strength or the opportunity to use the
</p>
<p>force. And when here and there some man like the McNamaras
</p>
<p>and others I don 't need to mention them alone, excepting that
</p>
<p>I want to live to see the day that justice will be done to them
</p>
<p>(loud applause) here and there when they reach out blindly
</p>
<p>to meet force with force, call it blind if you will, call it wrong
</p>
<p>if you will; I have never counseled it or advised it, perhaps
</p>
<p>because I am not brave enough ; it is not for me to say ; but
</p>
<p>call it blind, call it mistaken, call it what you will ; but the fact
</p>
<p>will ever remain that men who do it never do it for their own
</p>
<p>mean personal ends but because they love their fellowmen.
</p>
<p>(Loud applause). And long ago it was written down that
</p>
<p>"Greater love hath no man than this, that he who would give
</p>
<p>his life for his friend." Some day, I say, it will be understood,
</p>
<p>and some day the world will understand that they and Wood
</p>
<p>who was indicted from the other side for an attempt to charge
</p>
<p>something to labor that labor was not guilty of, and all of
</p>
<p>these other indictments growing out of the same acts, that all
</p>
<p>of these acts were not individual acts at all, but they were a
</p>
<p>part of a great industrial tragedy of a great evolution of society ;
</p>
<p>that they are what are called social crimes or social acts for
</p>
<p>which these men were responsible in no degree. They were a
</p>
<p>part of a machine; they were risking their lives; a part of
</p>
<p>a system; and, do what you will, others will be ground out of
</p>
<p>it forever and forever, until the system shall change and until
</p>
<p>there will be some equity and justice in the world. (Loud
</p>
<p>applause).
</p>
<p>The world is changing, and every person is doing his part
</p>
<p>in his own way. It is not for you to criticize me or for me to
</p>
<p>criticize you, but to judge men by their motives and to judge
</p>
<p>them by the side they are on. Labor must stand for its own
</p>
<p>men. (Loud applause). It must stand even for its own mis-
</p>
<p>takes, and its own crimes if it is guilty of them. (Applause).

<p>There is one question, and only one, to ask concerning a man
</p>
<p>or concerning an act: f 'Was he on my side?" (Applause).
</p>
<p>You may counsel him to do differently; yes. You may teach
</p>
<p>him moderation, and believe in it; and all of us want to see
</p>
<p>peace and justice and harmony come out of all of these con-
</p>
<p>tending forces, as it one day will come; you may teach it and
</p>
<p>you may believe it, but the man who lets a thought loose in the
</p>
<p>universe can never tell what the results of that thought may be.
</p>
<p>It may bear fruit in a thousand ways of which we never dream ;
</p>
<p>but even though it does and it must the thought must go
</p>
<p>forth to do its work and to change the face of the earth. The
</p>
<p>highest and the holiest and the best thought may bring on strife
</p>
<p>and war. And John Brown, a devoted man who believed in the
</p>
<p>liberty of the slaves, took his gun in his hand and went to
</p>
<p>Virginia and raised his hand in rebellion against the country.
</p>
<p>He was tried and convicted and hanged for murder, and he was
</p>
<p>guilty of murder under the laws of man, but under the laws
</p>
<p>of God he was a hero. The laws of justice and righteousness
</p>
<p>look not to the act but they look at the motive that moved the
</p>
<p>brain. Were they fighting on our side? Were they fighting
</p>
<p>for justice and humanity and the weak and the poor and the
</p>
<p>oppressed, as they saw it? If so, whoever they are and what-
</p>
<p>ever, they demand our sympathy and our support. (Applause).
</p>
<p>John Brown by his act of heroism plunged the United States
</p>
<p>into a civil war costing hundreds of thousands of lives, and
</p>
<p>billions of property. But he was not responsible for the
</p>
<p>thought. It came in the evolution of time. And so don't think
</p>
<p>that any one man is responsible for any one great event in this
</p>
<p>world. The earth is moving, the universe is working, all the
</p>
<p>laws of creation are working toward justice, toward a better
</p>
<p>humanity, toward a higher ideal, toward a time when
</p>
<p>men will be brothers the world over. (Applause). The evolu-
</p>
<p>tion will not all be peaceful. It can't be. There will be con-
</p>
<p>flict and blood shed; there will be prisons, there will be jails,

<p>but through it all this same humanity that has come onward
</p>
<p>and upward from the brute below us, onward and upward 1
</p>
<p>where we are today, this same humanity will be growing in
</p>
<p>wisdom and strength and righteousness, and the good and
</p>
<p>the evil, the peace and the charity, the violence and all, will
</p>
<p>be combined to make "man better and make the world jusit-r
</p>
<p>and fairer than it has ever been before. (Loud applaune).
