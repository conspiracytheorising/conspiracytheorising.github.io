<p>INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>The Committee on Public Information
</p>
<p>publishes herewith a series of communica-
</p>
<p>tions between the German Imperial Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment and the Russian Bolshevik Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, and between the Bolsheviks
</p>
<p>themselves, and also the report thereon
</p>
<p>made to George Creel by Edgar Sisson, the
</p>
<p>committee's special representative in Rus-
</p>
<p>sia during the winter of 1917-18. There is
</p>
<p>also included, in Part II, a report by a
</p>
<p>committee appointed by the National
</p>
<p>Board for Historical Service to examine
</p>
<p>into the genuineness of these docimients.
</p>
<p>The documents show that the present
</p>
<p>heads of the Bolshevik Government 
</p>
<p>Lenin and Trotsky and their associates 
</p>
<p>are German agents.
</p>
<p>They show that the Bolshevik revolu-
</p>
<p>tion was arranged for by the German
</p>
<p>Great General Staff, and financed by the
</p>
<p>German Imperial Bank and other Ger-
</p>
<p>man financial institutions.
</p>
<p>They show that the treaty of Brest-
</p>
<p>Litovtk was a betrayal of the Rusiiian
</p>
<p>people by the German agents, Lenin and
</p>
<p>Trotsky; that a German-picked com-
</p>
<p>mander was chosen to "defend" Petrograd
</p>
<p>against the Germans; that German officers
</p>
<p>have been secretly received by the Bol-
</p>
<p>shevik Government as military advisers,
</p>
<p>as spies upon the embassies of Russia's

</p>
<p>allies, as officers in the Russian army, and
</p>
<p>as directors of the Bolshevik military, for-
</p>
<p>eign, and domestic policy. They show, in
</p>
<p>short, that the present Bolshevik Govern-
</p>
<p>ment is not a Russian government at all,
</p>
<p>but a German government acting solely
</p>
<p>in the interests of Germany and betraying
</p>
<p>the Russian people, as it betrays Russia's
</p>
<p>natural allies, for the benefit of the Im-
</p>
<p>perial German Government alone.
</p>
<p>Russian Workmen Betrayed
</p>
<p>And they show also that the Bolshevik
</p>
<p>leaders, for the same German Imperial
</p>
<p>ends, have equally betrayed the working
</p>
<p>classes of Russia whom they pretend to
</p>
<p>represent.
</p>
<p>The documents are some 70 in number.
</p>
<p>Many are originals, annotated by Bolshe-
</p>
<p>vik officials. The balance of the others
</p>
<p>are photograplis of originals, showing an-
</p>
<p>notations. And they corroborate a third
</p>
<p>set of typewritten circulars (see Appendix
</p>
<p>later) of which only two originals are
</p>
<p>possessed in any form, but all of which fit
</p>
<p>into the whole pattern of German in-
</p>
<p>trigue and German guilt.
</p>
<p>The first document is a photograph of a
</p>
<p>report made to the Bolshevik leaders by
</p>
<p>two of their assistants, informing them
</p>
<p>that, in accordance with their instructions.
</p>
<p>there had been removed from the archives
</p>
<p>of the Russian Ministry of Justice, the
</p>
<p>order of the German Imperial Bank "al-
</p>
<p>lowing money to Comrades Lenin,
</p>
<p>Trotsky, 'and others' for the propaganda
</p>
<p>The GERMAN-BOLSHEVIK CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>that'"50,O0O,OOO roubles of gold has been
</p>
<p>transferred to be put at the disposal of the
</p>
<p>People's Commissars," which is the title
</p>
<p>of the Bolshevik leaders. "This credit,"
</p>
<p>the letter continues, "has been supplied
</p>
<p>to the Russian Government in order to
</p>
<p>cover the cost of the keep of the Red
</p>
<p>Guards [the Bolshevik revolutionary'
</p>
<p>troops] and agitators in the country. The
</p>
<p>Imperial Government considers it appro-
</p>
<p>priate to remind the Council of People's
</p>
<p>Commissars of the necessity of increasing
</p>
<p>their propaganda in the country, as the an-
</p>
<p>tagonistic attitude of the south of Russia
</p>
<p>and Siberia to the existing Government in
</p>
<p>Russia is troubling the German Govern-
</p>
<p>ment."

<p>War Materials at Vladivostok
</p>
<p>Four days later the same representative
</p>
<p>of the German Imperial Bank sent another
</p>
<p>5,000,000 roubles to the same address to
</p>
<p>provide for the sending of a Russian revo-
</p>
<p>lutionary leader to Vladivostok, to get
</p>
<p>possession of the "Japanese and Ameri-
</p>
<p>can war materials" at that port, and if
</p>
<p>necessary to destroy them. A photograph
</p>
<p>of his letter is given as Document No. 9.
</p>
<p>There were earlier payments, but
</p>
<p>probably none later than these. None
</p>
<p>was necessary. By this time the loot
</p>
<p>of an empire lay open to the Bolshe-
</p>
<p>ks  and to the Germans.

</p>
<p>Documents Nos. 10 and 11. One is a
</p>
<p>letter addressed to the Chairman of the
</p>
<p>Council of People's Commissars, and the
</p>
<p>other is the "resolution of a conference of
</p>
<p>representatives of the German commer-

<p>cial banks" rcceivetl by the Chairman of
</p>
<p>the Bolshevik Central Executive Commit-
</p>
<p>tee and indorsed by his secretary. To-
</p>
<p>gether they give a complete .synopsis of

<p>the terms on which Germany intends to
</p>
<p>have control of all Russian industries.
</p>
<p>For five years from the signing of peace,
</p>
<p>English, French, and American capital
</p>
<p>in Russia is to be "banished" and "not
</p>
<p>to be allowed in the following industries:
</p>
<p>coal, metallurgical, machine building, oil,
</p>
<p>chemical, and pharmaceutical." These in-
</p>
<p>dustrie.s are to be developed under the
</p>
<p>control of a "supreme advisory organ con-
</p>
<p>sisting of 10 Russian specialists, 10 from
</p>
<p>the German industrial organizations ami
</p>
<p>the German and Austrian banks." Germany
</p>
<p>and Au.stria are to "enjoy the unlimited
</p>
<p>privilege of .sending into Russia mechanics
</p>
<p>and qualified workmen." "Other foreign
</p>
<p>mechanics and workmen . . . are not
</p>
<p>to be allowed to enter at all" for five year.f
</p>
<p>after the conclusion of peace between
</p>
<p>Russia and Germany. "Private Vjanks in

<p>CHAPTER I.
</p>
<p>THE BASIC CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>Three groups of documents are sub-
</p>
<p>jected to internal analysis in the material
</p>
<p>that follows. One group consists of origi-
</p>
<p>nals, one group consists of photographs of
</p>
<p>documents believed still to be in the file
</p>
<p>rooms of the Russian Bolsheviki, and the
</p>
<p>third (Appendix I) of typewritten circulars
</p>
<p>that have not been traced to their origi-
</p>
<p>nals except perhaps in the case of two
</p>
<p>of the number. The chief importance of
</p>
<p>the third group is that its appearance in-
</p>
<p>spired the efforts that led to the uncover-
</p>
<p>ing of the other groups. And they fit into
</p>
<p>the fabric of the whole.
</p>
<p>The first set of these appendix circulars
</p>
<p>came into my hands on February 2, in
</p>
<p>Petrograd. An additional set appeared
</p>
<p>the following day at an office where I fre-
</p>
<p>quently called. A third appeared in an-
</p>
<p>other quarter a day afterwards. One set
</p>
<p>was in Russian and two in English. On
</p>
<p>February 5 I held all three sets. A pos-
</p>
<p>sible explanation for their appearance at
</p>
<p>this time and their intent is given in Ap-
</p>
<p>pendix I.
</p>
<p>By themselves they were plausible but
</p>
<p>not substantiated. Having first performed
</p>
<p>the obvious duty of analyzing them for

</p>
<p>surface values and transmitting them and
</p>
<p>the analyses to Washington, I turned,
</p>
<p>therefore, to the task of further investi-
</p>
<p>gations.
</p>
<p>It isf not yet possible to name those
</p>
<p>who helped, but in three weeks' time the
</p>
<p>judgment of facts became apparent.
</p>
<p>The text of the documents discloses both
</p>
<p>the methods and the effects of the Ger-
</p>
<p>man conspiracy not alone against Russia,
</p>
<p>but the world. With each document is
</p>
<p>the indication of whether it is an original
</p>
<p>or photograph. With each document is an
</p>
<p>interpretati\e note.

<p>To THE Chairman of the Cottncil of

<p>People's Commissars:
</p>
<p>In accordance with the resolution

<p>of the business relations of the party-

<p>in the said communications a danger

<p>The following documents show in de-
</p>
<p>tail how the German Government financed
</p>
<p>the Russian Bolshevik revolution through
</p>
<p>the German Imperial Bank.
</p>
<p>They show what rewards the German

<p>financial and industrial interests demanded
</p>
<p>in return for the German support of the

<p>Bolsheviki. And they show how the Bol-
</p>
<p>shevik leaders betrayed their own fol-
</p>
<p>lowers and abandoned the preaching of
</p>
<p>their social revolution wherever the Ger-
</p>
<p>mans ordered that it should be abandoned.

<p>soldiers were paid hardly that number of

<p>came from.. The Bolshenk Government also
</p>
<p>required factory owners to pay regular wages
</p>
<p>to their workers lohile the latter served in the

<p>was the German, von Toll. Menshinski

<p>To THE Chairman of the Council

<p>OF People's Commissars:
</p>
<p>According to reports of our secret
</p>
<p>agency in the detachments operating
</p>
<p>against the German troops and
</p>
<p>against the Austrian Ukrainian corps,
</p>
<p>there has been observed propaganda
</p>
<p>for a national rising and a struggle
</p>
<p>with the Germans and their alhes,
</p>
<p>the Ukrainians. I ask you to inform
</p>
<p>me what has been done by the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment to stop this harmful agita-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>For the head of the Bureau:

<p>R. Bauer.
</p>
<p>Adjutant: Henbich.
</p>
<p>Note.-  Across the top is written: "Ur-
</p>
<p>gent. To the Cojnmissars of War and
</p>
<p>Special Staff. M. Skripnik." The last
</p>
<p>sentence is underscored, and in the inargin
</p>
<p>appears a question mark, initialed "L. T."
</p>
<p>The first is Lenin's order through the sec-
</p>
<p>retary, and the second may possibly be
</p>
<p>taken as Trotsky's opposition to any ac-
</p>
<p>tion. The loss of the Ukraine by counter
</p>
<p>German intrigue was a sore point in pres-
</p>
<p>tige with him.  But his essential obedience
</p>
<p>to Germany was not lessened.

<p>minister of the Soviet Government of

<p>Workmen, Soldiers, and Sailors of the

<p>Russian Republic, delivered not by an
</p>
<p>equal in official rank, but by the deputy
</p>
<p>of a German major at the head of an in-
</p>
<p>telligence department of the German
</p>
<p>Government. Did Trotsky resent or deny
</p>
<p>the imputation? Instead he wrote with
</p>
<p>his own hand in the margin: "I ask to
</p>
<p>discuss it. L. T." Thus he admits that
</p>
<p>he did give the promise at Brest-Litovsk.

<p>robbery of the Italian ambassador took place

<p>late in the evening on a lighted frequented

<p>central street and was a day's sensation.

<p>The observation point on the American

<p>Embassy was a yellow apartment house al-
</p>
<p>most opposite the entrance. After I got this

<p>information I tested the ^vatch and always

<p>when I left, Monday, March 4, the day
</p>
<p>that Petrograd received notification that
</p>
<p>peace had been signed at Brest-Lit ovsk
</p>
<p>by the Russian and German delegations.
</p>
<p>Trotsky, therefore, rests rightly under
</p>
<p>the accusation of having staged his the-
</p>
<p>atrical scene as a climax to the Russian
</p>
<p>disorganization desired by Germany. The
</p>
<p>actual order he gave was for the immedi-
</p>
<p>ate demobilization of the Russian army,
</p>
<p>leaving the German army unopposed.
</p>
<p>The actual effect of the work of the
</p>
<p>Bolshevik leaders, moreover, was to en-
</p>
<p>able Germany to combine its former army
</p>
<p>of the Russian front with its western
</p>
<p>army, for the launching of its March of-
</p>
<p>fensive in France. Such has been the
</p>
<p>fruition of Russia's German-directed Bol-
</p>
<p>shevikism.

<p>seems to be that of the mouthpiece of Germany,

<p>has written in the 7nnrgin, "According to

<p>The Commissar on Combating the

<p>gram, No. 235, demanded the sending
</p>
<p>of special agents to Kiefl and Novocher-

</p>
<p>There have been sent Conu-ades

<p>who have more than once very suc-
</p>
<p>cessfully performed information ser-

<p>on an intensive agitation in favor of a

<p>The GERMAN-BOLSHEVIK CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>(western calendar) Trotsky, at the request of
</p>
<p>Gen. Hoffman, ordered the arrest in Petro-
</p>
<p>grad of the Roumanian minister Diamandi.
</p>
<p>(See Document 37 A .)
</p>
<p>At about the same thrie the Roumanian
</p>
<p>public gold reserves in custody mthin the
</p>
<p>Kremlin walls at Moscow were seized by the
</p>
<p>Russian Goi'ernmenl. Diamandi was re-
</p>
<p>leased from arrest at the demand of the
</p>
<p>united diplomatic delegations at Pelrograd,
</p>
<p>but his humiliations continued, and on
</p>
<p>January 28 he was ordered from Pelrograd,
</p>
<p>being given less than 10 hours to prepare for
</p>
<p>the departure of a party that contained many
</p>
<p>women and children. Ambassador Francis
</p>
<p>sought in vain of Zalkind, who was acting as
</p>
<p>Foreign Minister in the absence of Trotsky
</p>
<p>again at Brest, for an extension of the time
</p>
<p>of departures. The Roumanian parly was
</p>
<p>thrown pell-mell on a train at midnight.
</p>
<p>It was delayed in Finland on one excuse and
</p>
<p>another, not immediately apparent, but in
</p>
<p>three weeks the minister, leaving behind a
</p>
<p>large part of his people, was allowed to pro-
</p>
<p>ceed to Torneo. By good luck he reached
</p>
<p>there the day after the Red Guard lost Torneo
</p>
<p>to the While Guard. Tliat day saved his
</p>
<p>life, for on the person of Svetlitzsky, a Russian
</p>
<p>commissar who joined him in mid-Finland
</p>
<p>and accompanied him to Torneo, was found
</p>
<p>an order to Timofcyeff, the commissar at
</p>
<p>Torneo, to shoot him. Svellilzsky ivas shot

<p>instead. When I passed through Torneo
</p>
<p>the control officer talked frankly about the
</p>
<p>details, expressing the opinion that the shoot-
</p>
<p>ing might have been a mistake, as it was not
</p>
<p>shoum that Svetlilzsky was aware of the con-
</p>
<p>tents of the letter. Svetlitzsky, however, was
</p>
<p>an important person in Pelrograd, close to
</p>
<p>Trotsky. Our American party brought Gtir-
</p>
<p>anesco, the first secretary of Ihe Roumanian
</p>
<p>delegation, oid of Finland through the lines
</p>
<p>with IIS. He had been in Red Finland seven
</p>
<p>v.w'. Behind us at Bjerrteburg we left
</p>
<p>several families of Roumanians who had de-
</p>
<p>parted from Pelrograd with the minister. We
</p>
<p>would have liked to hove In-oughl them through
</p>
<p>the lines of the two armies, but our venture
</p>
<p>was loo desperate to permit unauthorized addi-
</p>

<p>APPENDIXES TO THE REPORT

<p>APPENDIX I
</p>
<p>DOCUMENTS CIRCULATED BY ANTI-
</p>
<p>BOLSHEVIKI IN RUSSIA
</p>
<p>This appendix is of circulars of which
</p>
<p>(except in two cases noted) I have neither
</p>
<p>originals nor authenticated copies. A
</p>
<p>number of sets of them were put out in
</p>
<p>Russian text in Petrograd and in other
</p>
<p>parts of Russia in the winter (1917-18) by
</p>
<p>the opponents of the Bolsheviki. The cir-
</p>
<p>culars were declared to be copies of docu-
</p>
<p>ments taken from the Counter Espionage
</p>
<p>Bureau of the Kerensky Government, sup-
</p>
<p>plemented by some earher material from
</p>
<p>the same bureau when it was under the
</p>
<p>Imperial Government. The opportunity
</p>
<p>for securing them could easily have been
</p>
<p>afforded to the agents and employees of
</p>
<p>the Bureau, for most of the employees
</p>
<p>walked out when the Bolsheviki grasped
</p>
<p>the Government, and could have taken
</p>
<p>freely of the contents of their departments.
</p>
<p>Some of the documents were included
</p>
<p>in the publication made in Paris, hitherto
</p>
<p>referred to.
</p>
<p>I have not relied on them as proof,
</p>
<p>but they fit to other fabrics of proof, and
</p>
<p>in the light of it are more valuable for
</p>
<p>themselves than they were when they
</p>
<p>stood alone.

</p>
<p>TIONAL BOARD FOR HISTORI-
</p>
<p>CAL SERVICE
</p>
<p>Committee on Public Information,
</p>
<p>Washington, D. C.
</p>
<p>October 18, 1918.
</p>
<p>Professor Joseph Schaefer, Vice Chair-
</p>
<p>man National Board for Historical
</p>
<p>Service, 1133 Woodward Building,
</p>
<p>Washington, D. C.
</p>
<p>Dear Sir: Professor Ford tells me that
</p>
<p>the Directors of the National Board for
</p>
<p>Historical Service are meeting this after-
</p>
<p>noon at four o'clock, and I have asked him
</p>
<p>to take up with you the matter of consider-
</p>
<p>ing the documents recently released for
</p>
<p>publication by the Committee on Public
</p>
<p>Information for the purpose of showing the
</p>
<p>intimate and continued connection of
</p>
<p>Lenin and Trotsky and their immediate
</p>
<p>associates with the German Government.
</p>
<p>When only the opening installments of
</p>
<p>the series of seven had been published, the
</p>
<p>question of authenticity was raised by the
</p>
<p>New York Evening Post. The rest of the
</p>
<p>press of America, virtually without excep-
</p>
<p>tion, accepted the fact of publication as^
</p>
<p>evidence of the genuineness of the docu-
</p>
<p>ments; and even the continued attempts of
</p>
<p>the New York Evening Post to rally the
</p>
<p>forces of doubt failed absolutely, only two
</p>
<p>men with any pretension of historical knowl-
</p>
<p>edge joining in any degree with the Post.

<p>As a matter of course, the Conunittee on
</p>
<p>Public Information was committed from the
</p>
<p>first to a policy of absolute openness with
</p>
<p>regard to these documents. While never
</p>
<p>submitted to any unofficial body for pur-
</p>
<p>poses of investigation, it is nevertheless the
</p>
<p>fact that they have been gone over time and
</p>
<p>again by various agencies of the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and were not released for publication
</p>
<p>by this Committee until express sanction
</p>
<p>had been received from the highest author-
</p>
<p>ities of the Government.
</p>
<p>It was our idea from the first, and it is
</p>
<p>our idea now, to make pamphlet presenta-
</p>
<p>tion of the documents, together with fac-
</p>
<p>simile reproductions of all the more im-
</p>
<p>portant originals. This task, attended by
</p>
<p>many mechanical difficulties, has just been
</p>
<p>completed.
</p>
<p>The situation that now faces us is this:
</p>
<p>The documents were given to the press with
</p>
<p>the good faith of the G9vernment behind
</p>
<p>them, and our promise is out to present
</p>
<p>them in pamphlet form with tlie photo-
</p>
<p>graphic reproductions of originals. We can-
</p>
<p>not, in any manner, afford to appear dila-
</p>
<p>tory or evasive, nor do we desire to publish
</p>
<p>the pamphlet without taking cognizance of
</p>
<p>the charges that have been made.
</p>
<p>What I would like to do is to present the
</p>
<p>documents to a Committee, to be ap-
</p>
<p>pointed by you, together with the charges
</p>
<p>that have been made, and to have these
</p>
<p>charges considered carefully with a view to
</p>
<p>determining their truth or falsity. If you
</p>
<p>will undertake this task, I would not desire

<p>The GERMAN-BOLSHEVIK CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>General Staff ot the German Army to dis-
</p>
<p>trict commandants, enjoining them to cause
</p>
<p>German industrial establishments to open
</p>
<p>their instructions respecting industrial mob-
</p>
<p>ilization; the other, dated November 28,
</p>
<p>1914, addressed bv the General Staff of the
</p>
<p>High Sea Fleet to maritime agencies and
</p>
<p>naval societies, and caUin on them to
</p>
<p>mobilize destructive agents in foreign har-
</p>
<p>bors, with a ^^ew to thwarting shipments of
</p>
<p>munitions to "England, France, Canada,
</p>
<p>the United States, and Russia." The prob-
</p>
<p>lem of their genuineness must be considered
</p>
<p>in connection with Documents Kos. 56 and
</p>
<p>58 in the Appendix, which are nearly iden-
</p>
<p>tical with them, differing in sense only as
</p>
<p>Russian translations might easily differ from
</p>
<p>German originals.
</p>
<p>The errors of tvpography, of spellmg, and
</p>
<p>even of grammar, in these German circu-
</p>
<p>lare, make it impossible to accept them as
</p>
<p>original prints of the General Staffs named.
</p>
<p>Certain peculiarities of expression tend in
</p>
<p>the same direction. In the naval circular
</p>
<p>the explanation, in parenthesis, of the Ger-
</p>
<p>man word Vereinigungen by the Russicism
</p>
<p>Arlelen (Russian word with German plural
</p>
<p>ending) makes it impossible to think of the
</p>
<p>document as one printed by the German
</p>
<p>Naval Staff for use indifferently in all the
</p>
<p>various countries in which there were Ger-
</p>
<p>man maritime agencies and naval societies.

<p>Furthermore, the reference to the United
</p>
<p>States is puzzling. On the other hand,
</p>
<p>Document No. 3, a protocol which presents
</p>
<p>e.xceptional evidences of genumeness, re-
</p>
<p>cords the transfer from Russian archives,
</p>
<p>into the hands of German military officials
</p>
<p>in Petrogi-ad, of two documents which it
</p>
<p>not only designates by date and number but
</p>
<p>describes; and date, number, and descrip-
</p>
<p>tida-eefresposd-^ tfeoseel-the^t^o paiJers
</p>
<p>in question. There is other evidence in
</p>
<p>Washington of the existence of two such
</p>
<p>circulars, said to be of the dates named, in
</p>
<p>Fctrograd archives in 1915. Attention
</p>
<p>should also be called to the manuscript an-
</p>
<p>notations on the circulars, plainly visible in
</p>
<p>the facsimiles. On both appears, in blue
</p>
<p>pencil, a note which, properly translated,
</p>
<p>reads: "One copy given to the Naclinchten-
</p>
<p>Bureau..\i- chive." That is to say, one
</p>
<p>printed copy has been handed over, in ac-
</p>
<p>cordance with the formal record made in
</p>
<p>Document No. 3, to the Military Intelli-
</p>
<p>gence Bureau of the German General Staff
</p>
<p>(a bureau which then or soon after was
</p>
<p>housed under the same roof with the Bol-
</p>
<p>shevist Government , in the Smolny Insti-
</p>
<p>tute), while this present printed copy is to
</p>
<p>be put in the Russian archives. The circu-
</p>
<p>lar dated June 9 bears also the annotation
</p>
<p>in red ink, "To the protocol [of] Nov. 2,
</p>
<p>1917," confirming the connection asserted.
</p>
<p>We do not think these two printed circu-
</p>

<p>think them to b(" in their present shape,
