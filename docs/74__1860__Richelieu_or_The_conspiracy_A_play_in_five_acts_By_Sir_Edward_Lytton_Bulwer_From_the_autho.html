<p>AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO RICHELIEF.
</p>
<p>Tlie administration of Cardinal Richelieu, whom (despite
</p>
<p>all liis darker qualities,) Voltaire and History justly consi-
</p>
<p>der the true architect of the French monarchy, and tha
</p>
<p>great parent of French civilization, is characterized by fea-
</p>
<p>tures alike tragic and comic. A weak king  an ambitioua
</p>
<p>favourite ; a despicable conspu'acy against the minister,
</p>
<p>nearly always associated with a dangerous treason against
</p>
<p>the State  these, with little variety of names and dates,
</p>
<p>constitute the eventful cycle through which, with a dazzling
</p>
<p>ease, and an arrogant confidence, the great luminary fulfilled
</p>
<p>its destinies. Blent together, in startling contrast, we see
</p>
<p>the grandest achievements and the pettiest agents ;  the
</p>
<p>spy  the mistress  the capuchin ;  the destruction of feu-
</p>
<p>dalism ; the humiliation of Austria ;  the dismemberment
</p>
<p>of Spain.
</p>
<p>Richelieu himself is still what he was in his own day  a
</p>
<p>man of two characters. If, on the one hand, he is justly
</p>
<p>represented as inflexible and vindictive, crafty and unscrupu-
</p>
<p>lous ; so, on the other, it cannot be denied that he was
</p>
<p>placed in times in which the long impunity of every license
</p>
<p>required stern examples:  that he was beset by perils and in-
</p>
<p>trigues, which gave a certain excuse to the subtlest inven-
</p>
<p>tions of self-defence  that his ambition was inseparably coii'
</p>
<p>nected with a passionate love for the glory of his country 
</p>
<p>and that, if he was her dictator, he was not less her bene-
</p>
<p>factor. It has been fairly remarked by the most impartial
</p>
<p>historians, that he was no less generous to merit than sever
</p>
<p>to crime  that, in the various departments of the State, the
</p>
<p>Army, and the Church, he selected and distinguished the
</p>
<p>ablest aspirants  that the wars which he conducted were,
</p>
<p>for the most part, essential to the preservation of Franco,

</p>
<p>and Europe itself, from the formidable encroachments of tin
</p>
<p>Austrian Ilouse  tlial, m spite of tliose wars, the people
</p>
<p>were not oppressed with exhorbitant imposts  and that be
</p>
<p>left the kingdom he had governed in a more flourishing and
</p>
<p>vigorous state than at any former period of the French his-
</p>
<p>tory, or at the decease of Louis XIY,
</p>
<p>The cabels formed against the great statesman were not
</p>
<p>carried on by the patriotism of public virtue, nor the emula-
</p>
<p>tion of equal talent ; they were but court struggles, in
</p>
<p>which the most worthless agents had recourse to the most
</p>
<p>desperate means.  In each, as I have before observed, we
</p>
<p>see combined the twofold attempt to murder the minister,
</p>
<p>and to betray the country. Such, then, are the agents, and
</p>
<p>such the designs, with which truth, in the Drama, as in His-
</p>
<p>tory, requires us to contrast the celebrated Cardinal ; not
</p>
<p>disguising his foibles or his vices, but not unjust to the
</p>
<p>grander qualities (especially the love of country,) by which
</p>
<p>they were often dignified, and, at times, redeemed.
</p>
<p>The historical drama is the concentration of historical
</p>
<p>events. In the attempt to place upon the stage the picture
</p>
<p>of an era, that license with dates and details, which Poetry
</p>
<p>permits, and which the highest authorities in the Drama of
</p>
<p>France herself, have sanctioned, has been, though not un-
</p>
<p>sparingly, indulged. The conspiracy of the Due de Bouillon
</p>
<p>is, for instance, amalgamated with the denouncement of the
</p>
<p>Day of Dupes ; and circumstances connected with the trea-
</p>
<p>son of Cinq-Mars (whose DrilUant youth and gloomy catas-
</p>
<p>trophe tend to subvert poetic and historic justice, by seduc-
</p>
<p>ing us to forget his base ingratitude and his perfidious apos-
</p>
<p>tacy,) are identified with the fate of the earlier favourite
</p>
<p>Baradas, whose sudden rise and as sudden fall passed into a
</p>
<p>proverb. I ought to add, that the noble romance of Cinq-
</p>
<p>Mars suggested one of the scenes in the fifth act ; and that
</p>
<p>for the conception of some portion of the intrigue connected
</p>
<p>with De Mauprat and Julie, I am with great alterations of
</p>
<p>incident, and considerable if not entire reconstruction cf

<p>author of Picdola.

<p>Lyndon, March, 1839
</p>
<p>EDITORIAL INTKODUCTIOX.
</p>
<p>1\ i play of Richelieu is far the most elaborate of Mr
</p>
<p>Bulv, ir's draraatic productions. It was originally per^
</p>
<p>formed, March Tth, 1839, at the Co vent Garden Theatre,
</p>
<p>to an overflowing house  Macready appearing as the Cardi-
</p>
<p>nal aid Miss Helen Fancit as Julie. It was put on the
</p>
<p>stage with every possible advantage of scenery and costume,
</p>
<p>and efficiently sustained throughout, in all its characters, by
</p>
<p>an excelle'-t company. Its success was remarkably brilhant ;
</p>
<p>and, for a series of nights, it drew crouded and delighted
</p>
<p>audiences.
</p>
<p>Ths autho" seems to have been partially indebtet for h\
</p>
<p>mateiials, to the historical novels of Alfred de Vigny, from
</p>
<p>whose admirable picture of the character of Richelieu, id
</p>
<p>" Cinq-Mars," he has borrowed some leading traits. He
</p>
<p>acknov/ledges his obligations to these and other sources in
</p>
<p>his preface. The original merits of the play, however, are
</p>
<p>obvious and great ; and it may be regarded as one of the
</p>
<p>most unexceptionable modern contributions to the English
</p>
<p>Standard Drama, It abounds in passages of great beauty,
</p>
<p>md of a high order of poetry.
</p>
<p>Simultaneously with its appearance in England, the play
</p>
<p>was received in this country by Mr. Forrest, to whom it
</p>
<p>nad been consigned by Mr. Bulwer, to be introduced upon
</p>
<p>the American Stage. It is unnecessary for us to say, with
</p>
<p>what ability the task was performed by our great tragedian.
</p>
<p>tlis personation of the old, high-spirited Cardinal, is alone
</p>
<p>BRfficient to vindicate his claims to a lasting histrionic repu-
</p>
<p>vfttion. It has never been surpassed  and to our mind,
</p>
<p>Qcver bpcn equalled  by the most eminent of his cotemp*

<p>the passages thus cojitted are those inserted with inverted commas. Many

<p>of the passages thus left out, however immaterial to the. audience, must

<p>obviously be such as the reader would be least inclined to dispense with

<p>viz : those which, without being absolutely essential to the business of the
</p>
<p>Stage, contain either the subtler strokes of character, or the more poetica-
</p>
<p>embellishments of description. A more important consequence of these
</p>
<p>suppressions is, that Richelieu himself is left too often, and too imre-
</p>
<p>lievedly, to positions which place him in an amiable light, without that
</p>
<p>shadowing forth of his more sinister motives and his fiercer qualities
</p>

</p>
<p>Orleans, Baradas, De Beringhen, Courtiers, SfC,
</p>
<p>Orleans. How does my brother bear tlie Cardinal'^
</p>
<p>death?
</p>
<p>Bar. With grief when thinking of the toils of State ;
</p>
<p>With joy, when thinking on the eyes of Julie : 
</p>
<p>At times he sighs, " Who now shall govern France ?"
</p>
<p>Anon exclaims  " Who now shall baffle Louis V
</p>
<p>Enter Louis and other Courtiers. They uncovet.
</p>
<p>Orleans. Now, my liege, now, I can embrace a brother
</p>
<p>Louis. Dear Gaston, yes. I do believe you love me ; 
</p>
<p>Richelieu denied it  sever'd us too long.
</p>
<p>A great man, Gaston 1 Who shall govern Trance ?
</p>
<p>Bar. Yourself, my liege. That swart and potent ataj
</p>
<p>Eclipsed your royal orb. He served the country.
</p>
<p>But did he serve, or seek to sway the King ?
</p>
<p>Louis. You're right  he was an able politician (I)
</p>
<p>That's all :  ^between ourselves, Count, I suspect
</p>
<p>The largeness of his learning  specially
</p>
<p>In falcons (2)  ^poor huntsman, too 1
</p>
<p>Bar. Ha  ha 1

</p>
<p>Am I not to be pitied ?  ^what a day
</p>
<p>For 
</p>
<p>Bar Sorrow ?  No, sire !
</p>
<p>Louis. Bah 1 for hunting, man,
</p>
<p>And Richelieu's dead ; 'twould be an indecorum
</p>
<p>Till he is buried  (yawns)  life is very tedious.
</p>
<p>I made a madrigal on life last week ;
</p>
<p>You do not sing, (3) Count ? Pity ; you should learn.
</p>
<p>Poor Richelieu had no ear  ^yet a great man.
</p>
<p>Ah 1 what a weary weight devolves upon me I
</p>
<p>These endless wars  these thankless Parliaments 
</p>
<p>The snares in which he tangled States and Kings,
</p>
<p>Like the old fisher of the fable, Proteus,
</p>
<p>Netting great Neptune's wariest tribes and changing
</p>
<p>Into all shapes when Craft pursued himself ;
</p>
<p>Oh, a great man 1
</p>
<p>JBar. Your royal mother said so.
</p>
<p>And died in exile,
</p>
<p>Louis, (sadly). True : I loved my mother 1 (4)
</p>
<p>Bar. The Cardinal dies. Yet day revives the earth
</p>
<p>The rivers run not back. In truth, my liege.
</p>
<p>Did your high orb on others shine as on him,
</p>
<p>Why, things as dull in their own selves as I am
</p>
<p>Would glow as brightly with the borrowed beam, (5)
</p>
<p>Louis. Ahem 1 He was too stern,
</p>
<p>Orleans. A very Nero.
</p>
<p>Bar. His power was like the Capitol of old 
</p>
<p>Built on a human skull,
</p>
<p>Louis. And, had he lived,
</p>
<p>I know another head, my Baradas,
</p>
<p>That would have propp'd the pile : I've seen him eye thesf
</p>
<p>With a most hungry fancy.

</p>
<p>Louis. Did you so ? of course 1
</p>
<p>A.nd yet he had a way with him  a something
</p>
<p>That always But no matter, he is dead.
</p>
<p>And, after all, men called his King " The Just," (6)
</p>
<p>And so I am. Dear Count, this silliest Julie,
</p>
<p>I know not why, sho takes my fancy. Many
</p>
<p>Scene I.j richeuec. 65
</p>
<p>As fair, and certainly more kind ; liut yet
</p>
<p>It is so. Count, I am no lustful Tarquin,
</p>
<p>And do abhor the bold and frontless vices
</p>
<p>Which the Church justly censures ; yet, 'tis sad
</p>
<p>On rainy days to drag out weary hours  (T)
</p>
<p>Deaf to the music of a woman's voice 
</p>
<p>Blmd to the sunshine of a woman's eyes.
</p>
<p>It is no sin in Kings to seek amusement ;
</p>
<p>And that ^ all I seek. I miss her much :
</p>
<p>She has a silver laugh  a rare perfection.
</p>
<p>Ba^. Richelieu was most disloyal in that marriage.
</p>
<p>Louis (querulously). He knew that Julie pleased me :
</p>
<p>a clear proof
</p>
<p>He never loved me !
</p>
<p>Bar. Oh, most clear ! But now

<p>I'll summon Julie back. A word with you.

<p>NOTi:S TO RICHKI.:Hir.
</p>
<p>NOTES TO ACT {.
</p>
<p>(1) Olivares, Minister of Spain.
</p>
<p>(2) There are many anecdotes of the irony, often so teriible, in wblcll
</p>
<p>Richelieu indulged. But he had a love for humour in its more hearty and
</p>
<p>genial shape. He would send for Boisrobert " to make him laugh," and
</p>
<p>grave ministers and magnates waited in the ante-room, while the great
</p>
<p>Cardinal listened and responded to the sallies of the lively wit.
</p>
<p>(3) The Abta6 Arnaud tells us that the queen was a little avenged on the
</p>
<p>Cardinal by the ill-success of the tragic comedy of Mirame  more than
</p>
<p>suspected to be his own though presented to the world under the foster
</p>
<p>name of Desmarets. Its representation (says Pelisson) cost him 300,000
</p>
<p>crowns. He was so transported out of himself by the performance, that at
</p>
<p>one time, he thrust his person half out of his box to show himself to the
</p>
<p>assembly ; at another time he imposed silence on the audience that they
</p>
<p>might not lose " des endroits encore plus beaux." He said afterwards to
</p>
<p>Desmarets ; " Eh bien, les Francais n'auront done jamais de goiit. Ha
</p>
<p>n'ont pas 6td charm^s de Mirame !" Arnaud says pithily, " On ne pouvoit
</p>
<p>alo^s avoir d'antre satisfaction des offenses d'un nomme qui ^toit maiti-e de
</p>
<p>tout, et rcdoutable a tout le monde. " Nevertheless his style in prose,
</p>
<p>though not devoid of the pedantic affectations of the time, often rises into
</p>
<p>very noble eloquence.
</p>
<p>(4) " Vialart remarque nnc chose qui pent expliquer la conduite de Ei-
</p>

<p>and influence with Richelieu, grossly exaggerated in his own day, are now
</p>
<p>rightfully estimated.

<p>NOTES TO ACT H.
</p>
<p>(1) Ricl-slieu not only employed the lowest, but would often consult men
</p>
<p>commonly esteemed the dullest. " II disoit que dans des choses de trei
</p>

<p>92 RICHSLIED
</p>
<p>(2) Both Eict elivju and Joseph were originahy inte aded for tie profea
</p>
<p>rion of arms. Joseph had served before he obeyed the spiritual iaspir*
</p>
<p>tion to become a Capuchin. The death of his brother opened to Richoliea
</p>
<p>the Bishopric of Lucon ; but his military propensities were as strong aa
</p>
<p>bis priestly ambition. I need scarcely add that the Cardina', dming his
</p>
<p>brilliant campaign in Italy, marched at the head of his troops in complete
</p>
<p>amiour. It was under his administration that occurs the last example of pro-
</p>
<p>claiming war by the chivaMc defiance of herald and cartel. Eichelieu
</p>
<p>valued himself much on his personal activity,  for his vanity was as uni-
</p>
<p>versal as his ambition. A nobleman at the house of Grammont one day
</p>
<p>found him jmployed in jumping, and, with all the savoir vivre of a French- ~
</p>
<p>man aftd a courtier, ofiered to jump against him. He suffered the Cardinal
</p>
<p>to jump higher, and soon after found himself rewarded by an appoint-
</p>
<p>ment. Yet, strangely enough, this vanity did not lead to a patronage in-
</p>
<p>jurious to the state ; for never before in France was ability made so es-
</p>
<p>sential a requisite in promotion. He was lucky in finding the cleverest
</p>
<p>fellows among his adroitest flatterers.
</p>
<p>(3) Voltaire openly charges Richelieu with being the lover of Marion de
</p>
<p>Lorme, whom the great poet of France, Victor Hugo, has sacrificed His-
</p>
<p>tory to adorn with qualities which were certainly not added to her personal
</p>
<p>channs.  She was rfot less perfidious than beautiful.  Le Clerc, properly,
</p>
<p>refutes the accusation of Voltaire, against the discretion of Richelieu ;
</p>
<p>and says, very justly, that if the great mhuster had the frailties of human
</p>
<p>nature, he learnt how to veil them, at least when he obtained the scarlet.
</p>
<p>In earlier life he had been prone to gallantries which a little prepossessed
</p>
<p>the King (who was formal and decorous, and threw a singular coldness
</p>
<p>into the few attachments he permitted to himself) against the aspiring in-
</p>
<p>triguer. But these gayer occupations died away in the engagement of
</p>
<p>higher pursuits or of darker passions.
</p>
<p>(4) Richelieu did in fact so thoroughly associate himself with the State,
</p>
<p>that, in cases where the extreme penalty of the law had been incurred, Le
</p>
<p>Clerc justly observes that he was more inexorable to thosie he had favoured
</p>
<p>even to his own connections than to other and more indifferent oflfend-
</p>
<p>ers. It must be remembered as some excuse for his unrelenting sternness,

</p>
<p>that, before his time, the great had been accustomed to commit any dis-
</p>
<p>order with impunity  even the crime of treason, " auparavant on ne fais-
</p>
<p>oit poser les armes aux rebelles qu'en leur accordant quelque recompense."
</p>
<p>On entering into the administration, he therefore laid it down as a maxim
</p>
<p>neoessary to the existence of the State, that " n crime should be com-
</p>
<p>mitted with impunity." To carry out this maxim, the long established li-
</p>
<p>cense to crime made even justice seem cruel. But the victims most com-
</p>
<p>miserated from their birth or accomplishments, as Montmorenci, or Cinq
</p>
<p>Mars were traitors in actual conspiracy against their country, and would
</p>
<p>have forfeited life in any land where the punishment of death existed,
</p>
<p>and the lawgiver was strong enough to vindicate the law. Richelieu was
</p>
<p>in fact a patriot nnsoftened by philantrophy. As in Venice (where the
</p>
<p>favom-ite aphorism was, Venice first, Christianity next,) so, with Richelieu
</p>
<p>the primary consideration was, " what will be the best for the Country ?"
</p>
<p>He had no abstract principle, whether as a politician or a priest, when
</p>
<p>applied to the world that lay beyond the boundaries of France. Thus he,
</p>
<p>whose object was to found in France a splendid and imperious despotism
</p>
<p>assisted the Parliamentary party in England, and signed a treaty of al-
</p>
<p>liance and subsides with the Catalan rebels for the establishment of a
</p>
<p>Bepublic in Barcelona ;  ^to convulse other Moaarchies was to consolidata
</p>
<p>(he growing Monarchy of France. So he, who completely cmshed th^
</p>
<p>Protestant party at home, braved all the wrath of the Vatican, and even
</p>
<p>RICHELIKU. WO
</p>
<p>the resentment of the Kit g, in giving tlie most essEn'viAl aid to the Pro.
</p>
<p>teatants abroad. There was, indeed, a largeness of view in his hostility
</p>
<p>to the French Huguenots, which must be carefully distinguished from the
</p>
<p>intolerance of the mere priest. He opposed them, not as a Catholic, hut as
</p>
<p>u Statesman. The Huguenots were strong republicans, and had formed
</p>
<p>plans for dividing France into provincial commonwealths ; and the exist-
</p>
<p>ence of Rochelle was absolutely incompatible with the integrity of the
</p>
<p>French Monarchy. It was a second capital held by the Huguenots, claim-
</p>
<p>ing independent authority, and the right to treat with Foreign Po\Yer3i
</p>
<p>Eichelieu's final conquest was marked by a humanity, that had nothing cf
</p>
<p>the bigot. The Huguenots obtained a complete amnesty, and had only ts
</p>
<p>regret the loss of privileges and fortifications which could not have existoi
</p>
<p>with any security to the rest of France.
</p>
<p>(5) The guard attached to Eichelieu's person was, in the first instance,
</p>
<p>fifty arquebussiers, afterwards increased to two companies of cavalry and
</p>
<p>two hundred musqueteers. Huguet is, therefore, to be considered merely
</p>
<p>as the lieutenant of a small detachment of this little aimy. In jjoint of
</p>
<p>fact the subdivisions of the guard took it in turns to serve.
</p>
<p>(6) This tract, on the " Unity of the Minister," contains all the doc-
</p>
<p>trines, and many more to the same effect, referred to in the text, and had a
</p>
<p>prodigious influence on the conscience of the poor king. At the onset of
</p>
<p>nis career, Eichelieu, as deputy of the clergy of Poitou, complained in hia
</p>
<p>harangue to the king that ecclesiastics were too rarely summoned to the
</p>
<p>royal councils, and invoked the example of the Druids !
</p>
<p>(7) Joseph's ambition was not, however, so moderate ; he refused a
</p>
<p>bishopric, and desired the Cardinal's Hat, for which favour Eicheliea
</p>
<p>openly supplicated the Holy See, but contrived, somehow or other, never
</p>
<p>to efliect it, although two ambassadors applied for it at Rome.
</p>
<p>(8) The peculiar religion of Fere Joseph may be illustrated by the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing anecdote :  An oflicer, whom he had dismissed upon an expedition
</p>
<p>into Gennany, moved by conscience at the orders he' had received, returned
</p>
<p>for farther explanations, and found the Capuchin disant sa masse. He ap-
</p>
<p>proached and whispered " But, my father, if these people defend theoft-
</p>
<p>pelves  " " Kill all," (Qu'oq tue tout,) answered the good father, conU

<p>NOTES TO ACT III.
</p>
<p>(1) 1 need not say that the great length of this soliloqi y adapts it onW

</p>
<p>the reader however, the passages omitted in represe tation will not, cer-
</p>

<p>go subtly the place of words in the closet. The self-assured sophisrhf^
</p>
<p>irhich, m the text, mingle with Eichelieu's better-fou ded arguments in
</p>
<p>apologv for the darker traits (,f his character, are to be found scattered
</p>
<p>urunguout the writings ascribed te him. The reader wiU observe that is
</p>
<p>84 RlCnELISTT.
</p>
<p>this self-confession lies the jatent poetical justice, which sepiiratts  ti^
</p>
<p>piness from success.
</p>
<p>[2] It is well linown that Tvhen, on Ms death-bed, Richelieu was a-iked
</p>
<p>f he forgave his enemies, he replied, " I never had any, but those or the
</p>
<p>itate." And this was true enough, for Eichelieu and the state ^er
</p>
<p>me.
</p>
<p>[3] Eichelieu's vindication of himself from cruelty will be found ia
</p>
<p>various parts of Petitot's Collection, vols. xxi. xsx.
</p>
<p>[4] Voltaire has a striking passage on the singular fate of Richelieu,
</p>
<p>recalled every hour from his gigantic schemes to frustrate some miserable
</p>
<p>cabal of the ante-room. Richelieu would often excl:a, that " Six pieda
</p>
<p>de terre [as he called the king's cabinet] lui donnaient plus de peine qTia
</p>
<p>tout le reste de I'Europe." The death of Wallenstein, sacrificed by the
</p>
<p>Emperor Ferdinand, produced a most lively impression upon Richelieu.
</p>
<p>He found many traits of comparison between Ferdinand and Louis  Wal-
</p>
<p>lenstein and himself. In the Memoirs now regarded by the best authori-
</p>
<p>ties as written by his sanction, and in great part by himself  the great
</p>
<p>Frenchman bursts [when alluding to Wallenstein's mui-der j into a touch-
</p>
<p>ing and pathetic anathema on the misere de cette vie of deper.dence on jea-
</p>
<p>.ous and timid royalty, which he himself, while he wrote, sustained. It ia
</p>
<p>.vorthy of remark, that it was precisely at the period of Wallenstein'a
</p>
<p>death that Richelieu obtained from the king an augmentation of bis
</p>
<p>guard.
</p>
<p>[51 Richelieu was commonly supposed, though I cannot say I find much
</p>
<p>evidence for it, to have been too presuming in an interview with Anne of
</p>
<p>Austria [the Queen,] and to have bitterly resented the contempt she ex-
</p>
<p>pressed for him. The Duke of Buckingham's frantic and Quixotic passion
</p>
<p>tor the Queen is well known.
</p>
<p>[6] The fear and the hatred which Richelieu generally inspired were not
</p>
<p>shared by his dependants and those about his person, who are said " to
</p>
<p>Dave adored him."  Ses domestiques le regardaient comme le meilleur dea
</p>
<p>mailres. Le Clerc. In fact although iletaic orgucilleux ct cokre,  he was
</p>
<p>en nmne lemps, affable et 2'lein de douceur dans Vabord ; and he was no less
</p>
<p>giHierous to those who served than severe to those who opposed him.

<p>NOTES TO ACT 1?.
</p>
<p>[IJ Omitted in representation from line 13 to 6G.
</p>
<p>[2] Louis XIII. is said to have possessed some natural talents, and ia
</p>
<p>eai'Iier youth to have exhibited the germs of nobler qualities ; but a
</p>
<p>lilight seems to have passed over his maturer life. Personally brave,
</p>
<p>'lut ran ally timid,  always governed, whether by his mother or his minis-
</p>
<p>ler, arxi always repining at the yoke. The only affection amounting to a
</p>
<p>[lassica that he betrayed was for the sports of the field ; yet it was his
</p>
<p>i;ra\iug wealvjiess, and this throws a kind of false interest over his char-
</p>
<p>actey, to wish to be loved. He himself loved no one. He suffered the only
</p>
<p>worn in who seems to have been attached to him to wither in a convent--
</p>
<p>he g ,iv up favo-irite after favourite to exile or the block. When Richeliea
</p>

<p>thi: k at this mument that le cher ami fait une vilainc mine." Ntverthe-
</p>
<p>less his conscience at times [for he was devout and superstitious] made
</p>
<p>Mm gentle ; and hi'; pride and his honour would often, when least expect-
</p>
<p>ed, rouse him into haughty but brief resistance to the despotism under
</p>
<p>which he hved.
</p>
<p>[;. 1 Louis had some musical taste and accomplishment, wherewith ho
</p>
<p>often communicated to his favourites some of that wearisome ennui under
</p>
<p>trhich he himself almost unceasingly languished.
</p>
<p>[4] One of Louis's most bitter complaints against Richelieu was thp
</p>
<p>continued banishment of the Queen Mother. It is impossible, however, noi
</p>
<p>to be convinced that the return of that worthless intriguante was whollv
</p>
<p>Incompatible with the tranquility of the kingdom. Yet, on the other hand,
</p>
<p>the poverty and privation which she endured in exile are discreditable to
</p>
<p>the generosity and the gratitude of Eichelieu  she was his first patron,
</p>
<p>-though afterwards his most powerful persecutor.
</p>
<p>[5] In his Memoirs Richelieu gives an amusing account of the insolence
</p>
<p>and arts of Baradas, and observes with indignant astonishment, that the
</p>
<p>'avourite was never weai-y of repeating to the King that he [Baradas]
</p>
<p>would have made just as great a minister as Richelieu. It is on the at-
</p>
<p>tachment of Baradas to La Cressias, a maid of honour to the Queen Mothci
</p>
<p>of whom, according to Baradas, the King was enamoured also, that hia
</p>
<p>love for the Julie de Mortemar of the play has been founded. The secret of
</p>
<p>Baradas's sudden and extraordinary influence with the King seems to rest
</p>
<p>in the personal adoration which he professed for Louis, with whom ha
</p>
<p>affected all the jealousy of a lover, but whom he flattered with the ardeat
</p>
<p>chivalry of a knight. Even after his disgrace he placed upcn his banne*',
</p>
<p>" Fiat voluntas tua."
</p>
<p>[6] Louis was called The Just, but for no other reason than that he was
</p>
<p>born under the Libra.
</p>
<p>[7] Louis XIII, did not resemble either his father or his son in the ar
</p>
<p>lour of his attachments ; if not wholly platonic, they were whoEy unim
</p>
<p>passioned ; yet no man was more jealous, or more unscrupulously tyranni-

</p>
<p>cal when the jealousy was aroused.
</p>
<p>[8] One of Richelieu's severest and least politic laws was that whieb
</p>
<p>made duelling a capital crime. Never was the punishment against the
</p>
<p>offence more relentlessly enforced ; and never were duels so desperate and
</p>
<p>so numerous. The punishment of death must be evidently ineffectual so
</p>
<p>long as to refuse a duel is to be dishonoured, and so long as men hold the
</p>
<p>doctrine, however wrong, that it is better to part with the life that Heaven
</p>
<p>gave than the honour man makes. In fact, the greater the danger lie in-
</p>
<p>cm-red, the greater was the punctilio of the cavalier of the time in brar-
</p>
<p>Ingit.
</p>
<p>[9] For the haughty and rebuking tone which Richelieu assumed in his
</p>
<p>postulations with the King, see his Memoirs [passim] in [Petitot's coUee-
</p>
<p>tion, vols. 22  30 [6w.] Montesquieu, in one of bis brilliant antitheses says
</p>
<p>well of Richelieu, II avila leroi, mais il illustrata le r^giae."
</p>
<p>[10] However " orgueiUeux and colere" in his disputes with Louis, the
</p>
<p>Cardinal did not always disdain recourse to the arts of the courtier ;  onc
</p>
<p>after an angry discussion with the king, in which, as usual, Richelieu gel
</p>
<p>ihe better, Louis, as they quilted the palace together, said rudely, " Soi'te?,
</p>
<p>le premier ; vous etes bien le roi da France." " Si je passe le premier/'
</p>
<p>replied the minister, after a moment's hesitation, and with great adroitaesa
</p>
<p>" ce ne peut etre que comme le plus huotble de^ vos serviteurs ;" and b
</p>
<p>took a flambeau from one rf fee pages, to light the king as he walbad b
</p>

<p>[12] Like Cromwell and Rienzi, Richelieu appears to have been easilj
</p>
<p>moved to tears. The Queen Mother, who put the hardest intei-pretation on
</p>
<p>that humane weakness, which is natural with very excitable temperamenta
</p>
<p>eaid that " II pleurait quand il voulait." I may add to those who may be
</p>
<p>inclined to imagine that Richelieu appears in parts of this scene too de-
</p>
<p>jected for consistency wi h so imperious a character, that it is recorded of
</p>
<p>Dim that " quand ses affaires ne eruississoient pas, il se trouvoit abattu el
</p>
<p>pouvant6, ct quand il obtenoit ce qu'il souhaitoit, 11 etoit fier et insultant.'

<p>NOTES TO ACT V.
</p>
<p>JI] See in " Cinq Mars," vol. v. the striking and brilliant chapter fi-mt.
</p>
<p>which the interlude of the Secretaries is bon-owed.
</p>
<p>[2] The passion of the drama requires this catastrophe for Baradas. He
</p>
<p>however, survived his disgrace, though stripped of all his rapidly-acquired
</p>
<p>fortunes  and the daring that belonged to his character won him distinc-
</p>
<p>tion in foreign service. He returned to France after Richelieu's death, but
</p>
<p>never regained the same court influence. He had taken the vows of a
</p>
<p>knight of Malta, and Louis made him a Prior.
</p>
<p>[3] The sudden resuscitation of RicheUeu [not to strain too much on the
</p>
<p>real passion which supports him in this scene] is in conformance with the
</p>
<p>more dissimulating part of his character. The extraordinary mobility of
</p>
<p>his countenance [latterly so deathlike, save when the mind spoke in the
</p>
<p>features] always lent itself to stage eflect of this nature. The queen
</p>
<p>mother said of him, that she had seen him one moment so feeble, cast
</p>
<p>down, and " semi-mort," that he seemed on the point of giving up the
</p>
<p>ghost and the next moment he would start up full of animKtioa, energjf
</p>
<p>and life.
