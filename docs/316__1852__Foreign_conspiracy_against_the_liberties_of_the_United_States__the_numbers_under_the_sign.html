<p>RECOMMENDATIONS.
</p>
<p>New York, Jan. 1, 1S35.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, Learning that you are about to publish in a small vol-
</p>
<p>ume, the articles signed Brutus, (which recently appeared in the
</p>
<p>New York Observer, showin;i that a conspiracy is formed agauist the
</p>
<p>United States by the Pai>al powers of Europe,) the undersigned, who
</p>
<p>road those articles with" interest, have great satisfaction in express-
</p>
<p>in" their approbation of your undertaking. These articles are writ-
</p>
<p>ten by a gentleman of intelligence and candor, who has resided in
</p>
<p>the south of Europe, and enjoyed the best opportunities for acquaint-
</p>
<p>ance with the topics on which he writes. . , t>
</p>
<p>While we disapprove of harsh, denun.-.iatory language toward Ro-
</p>
<p>man Catholics, their past history, and the fact that they everywhere
</p>
<p>act toceiher, as if guided bv one mind, admonish us to be jealous of
</p>
<p>their mllupnce, and to waich with unremitted care all their move-
</p>
<p>ments in relation to our free institutions. As this work is now to be
</p>
<p>published in a portable form, and with additional notes by the author,
</p>
<p>we hope it may obtain an exten.sive circulation and a careful perusal.
</p>
<p>Yours, with friendly regard,
</p>
<p>James Milnor, N. Bangs,
</p>
<p>Thomas De Witt, Jonathan Going.
</p>
<p>  The gentlemen who have signed the above letter, represent
</p>
<p>four Protestant denominations, viz., the Episcopal, Presbyterian,
</p>
<p>Methodist, and Baptist.

<p>"Foreign Conspiracy. We commence to-day publishing this in-
</p>
<p>terestin'T series. The author is an American, who has resided tor a
</p>
<p>long tiure in Italy and Austria. The same day that we had decided to
</p>
<p>publish them, we received a note, signed by Rev. Messrs. Lindsey,
</p>
<p>Fillmore, Kent, and Stevens, recommending and requesting that they
</p>
<p>should appear in the Herald."

</p>
<p>'Forei<fn Conspiracy against the Liberties of the United States," is

</p>
<p>a gentleman personally known to us, and universally esteemed. We
</p>
<p>conimend this volume to the serious attention of all Americans
</p>
<p>who love liberty, and mean to maintain it. The author undertakes
</p>
<p>to show that a conspiracy against the liberties of this Republic is
</p>
<p>now in full action, imder the direction of the wily Prince MetternicU
</p>
<p>of Austria, who, knowing the impossibility of obliterating th.s trou-
</p>
<p>blesome example of a great and free nation by force of arms, is at-
</p>
<p>temptincT to accomplish his object througli the agency of an army of
</p>
<p>Jesuits ' The array of farts and arguments going to prove the exist-
</p>
<p>ence of such a conspiracy, will astoni.sh any man who opens the
</p>
<p>book with the same incredulity as we did. The author has travelled
</p>
<p>extensively in Europe has resided many months, if not many years,
</p>
<p>in Italy and understands fidl well the kind of inachinerv which the
</p>
<p>politico-religious despots of the Old World would be likely tp put in
</p>
<p>motion for the subversion of our liberties. He has taken hold of the
</p>
<p>subject with a strong hand, and if he has not proved the existence of
</p>
<p>a conspiracy, he has certainly proved an immense accumulation o(
</p>
<p>foreign despotic influence among us, particularly in the VVest, by
</p>
<p>means of priests and money sent here from foreign despotic coun-
</p>

</p>
<p>tries. And he has further proved, that the personal iiifliience am)
</p>
<p>pecuniary aid of the Emperor of Au-slria and ins ])riri(:iiuil .Miiii.-sicr,
</p>
<p>as well as many of his sultjects, is directed wiili uuceusiui; assiiiuity
</p>
<p>to maintain the fooUiold Ihey have oained, and to s[ireait the couia-
</p>
<p>pion of their doctrines througliout this fair Republic. We ask afiain,
</p>
<p>that if any are disposed to regard this subject as of little inipijrlauce,
</p>
<p>they will give to the "Foreign Conspiracy" a serious and attentive
</p>
<p>perusal.  A'. Y. Journal of Commerce.
</p>
<p>" The author, well and alike known to us as an accomplished
</p>
<p>scholar and artist, has recently returned from an European residence
</p>
<p>of several years, during which period he became in various ways
</p>
<p>possessed of facts and circumstances inducing him to believe in the
</p>
<p>real and substantial existence of a conspiracy, which he has attempt-
</p>
<p>ed to expose. When he commenced his labors, we frankly told him,
</p>
<p>in repea'ed conversations, that we were incredulous of the fact he
</p>
<p>was maintaining ; but we are free to confess tliat, in the course of his
</p>
<p>labors he has brought forward a mass of direct and circumstantial
</p>
<p>testimony, documentary and otherwise, which has left a strong im-
</p>
<p>pression upon our minds, that after all, the alarm may not have been
</p>
<p>Bounded without cause. Events have also transpired in our own
</p>
<p>ctuntry, which, in connexion with the suspicious movements of ex-
</p>
<p>otic prelates, have imparted still greater importance to the writings
</p>
<p>of Brutus."  N. Y. Commercial Advertiser.
</p>
<p>One excellence of the publication before us, almost peculiar to this
</p>
<p>writer, when compared to others who have written upon this subject
</p>
<p>in our country, is, that it handles the matter of discussion with calm-
</p>
<p>ness, the writer not suffering himself to indite his letters under the
</p>
<p>influence of exacerbated feelings, but wisely avoids those harsh and
</p>
<p>blackening epithets which do more to irritate the passions than to
</p>
<p>convince and enlighten the judgment. On this account the book may
</p>
<p>be read with profit by all iV. Y. Christian Advocate. (Methodist.)
</p>
<p>" We would briefly observe that the work, as it is now revised and
</p>
<p>corrected by the author, and illustrated by him with an Appendix of

</p>
<p>valuable notes, seems to be something almost altogether new, if not
</p>
<p>as to the substance, at least as it respects its adventitious embellish-
</p>
<p>mcnt.s and illustrations. The notes of the Appendix may be truly
</p>
<p>considered as so many rich pearls, which set off a figure already and
</p>
<p>altogether prepossessing, to the best advantage.
</p>
<p>' The author manifests the spirit of a Christian on every page ; and
</p>
<p>although he develops a conspiracy the most formidable agairist our
</p>
<p>liberties, both civil and religious, not a vindictive breath ruffles the
</p>
<p>fercnity of his mind. He steps forward, conscious of the rectitude
</p>
<p>ol his motives, not to excite a false alarm, but coolly and deliberately
</p>
<p>to present facts to our view. This work, in regard to its classical
</p>
<p>merits, is an honor to American genius. The style is smooth, flow-
</p>
<p>ing, and mellifluous. It is like a garden whose walks are lined with
</p>
<p>flowers, where those who would imitate the industry of the bee, may
</p>
<p>find a rich profusion of varied sweets.
</p>
<p>" On reading the last chapter of this valuable work, wc are struck
</p>

</p>

</p>

<p>"From what I have seen and know, the fears entertained by the
</p>
<p>writer in the New York Observer, under the caption of 'Foreign

</p>
<p>RECOMMENDATIONS. 5
</p>
<p>The author maintains, that what is called the Roman Catholic Reli-
</p>
<p>gion is in reality a political despotism, disguised under a religious
</p>
<p>name. We ihinlc lie proves it ; and also that the leading enemies of
</p>
<p>free institutions in Europe are encaged in organized efforts to give
</p>
<p>that despotism prevalence in the United States. The author has not
</p>
<p>given his name ; but it may not be amiss to state that he has been in-
</p>
<p>timately acquainted with Popery in Europe.
</p>
<p>We do not believe that the progress of Popery in this country can
</p>
<p>be checked effectually in any way but by tlie conversion of its vota-
</p>
<p>ries. The Gospel must be prcaciied to the Catholic emigrant, and by
</p>
<p>its influence he must be brought to repent and believe. And it
</p>
<p>Beems evident to U5, that the political argument is, from its very na-
</p>
<p>ture, incapable of exciting men to the effort by which this can be ac-
</p>
<p>complished. Preaching the Gospel from political considerations will
</p>
<p>not convert men. We think that writers on Popery have been too
</p>
<p>unmindful of this truth. Yet the political argument, like all truth,
</p>
<p>has its value, and ought not to be neglected. In this work it is ad-
</p>
<p>mirably presented. We hope it will be widely circulated and atten-
</p>
<p>tively read.  Massachusetts, Boston Recorder. (Congregational.)
</p>
<p>"Brutus has published his 'Conspiracy,' &c., in a small volume,
</p>
<p>accoinpanied with notes. They are elaborate and eloquent articles.
</p>
<p>I hope it will be scattered over the whole country. He is a dis-
</p>
<p>tinguished scholar and artist of this city, and has his information
</p>
<p>from personal observation, while in Europe a few years since." 
</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor of tlie Mass. Zion's Herald. (Methodist.)
</p>
<p>The numbers of Brutus.  " Our readers are already acquainted
</p>
<p>with their contents. The object is to awaken the attention of the
</p>
<p>American public to a design, supposed to be entertained by the des-
</p>
<p>potic governments of Europe, particularly of Austria, in conjunc-
</p>
<p>tion with his Holiness the Pope, to undermine gradually our free in-
</p>
<p>stitutions by the promotion oi the Catholic religion in America.

<p>United States, who should guard with vigilance the sacred trust

</p>
<p>" Bruttts.  The able pieces over this signature, relative to the de-
</p>
<p>signs of Catholicity in our highly favored land, originally published
</p>
<p>in the New York Observer, it is now ascertained were written, not
</p>
<p>by an in<iividnal who was barely indulging in conjectures, but by one
</p>
<p>who has witnessed the Papacy in all its deformity. One who has, not
</p>
<p>long since, travelled extensively in the Romish countries, and has
</p>
<p>spent much time in the Italian States, where the seat of the Beast is.
</p>
<p>Rome is familiar to him, and he has watched the movements there
</p>
<p>with great particularity. We may, therefore, yield a good degree of
</p>
<p>credence to what Brutus has told us. His numbers are now pub-
</p>
<p>Ushed in a Pamphlet, and the fact which has just come out in regard
</p>
<p>to his peculiar qualification to write on this great suoject, will give
</p>
<p>them extensive circulation."  Utica Baptist Register.
</p>
<p>The work imbodies a mass of facts, collected from authentic
</p>
<p>sources, of the deepest intere.st to every friend of civil liberty and
</p>
<p>Protestant Christianity. The efforts of despotic European sovereigns,
</p>
<p>to inoculate our country with the religion of Roirie, are fully proved.
</p>
<p>Could they succeed in these efforts, and annihilate the spirit of lib-
</p>
<p>erty on our shores, the march of free principles in our own domin-
</p>
<p>ions would cease. They could then sit s^'curely on their thrones,
</p>
<p>and rule with a rod of iron over their abject vassals.  Ohio, Cincin-

<p>FOREIGN CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>AGAINST THE
</p>
<p>LIBERTIES OF THE UNITED STATES.
</p>
<p>BY BRUTUS.
</p>
<p>Preface to tlie Second Edition.
</p>
<p>The great and increasing attention to the subject
</p>
<p>of which these chapters treat, has given them an ex-
</p>
<p>tensive circulation. A large edition with notes has
</p>
<p>been rapidly sold, and two editions of the numbers,
</p>
<p>as they originally appeared in the New-York Obser-
</p>
<p>ver, have been printed in the Valley of the Missis-
</p>
<p>sippi, at the expense of patriotic Associations, and
</p>
<p>distributed throughout the western country. A larger
</p>
<p>and cheaper edition is now demanded, for general
</p>
<p>distribution, by numerous citizens belonging to vari-
</p>
<p>ous religious and opposite political sects.
</p>
<p>The author has w^atched with more than ordinary-
</p>
<p>solicitude, the movements throughout the country, in
</p>
<p>relation to this exciting subject, and has anxiously
</p>
<p>hoped that facts would transpire, which would prove
</p>
<p>that the charge of Conspiracy against the Liberties
</p>
<p>of the United States, conducted by the agents and
</p>
<p>funds of foreign powers, was groundless. Gladly
</p>
<p>would he make any personal sacrifice of feeling, and
</p>
<p>endure the stigma of being accounted a visionary or
</p>
<p>an alarmist, if satisfactory counter-testimony could
</p>
<p>be adduced that might safely allay the fears that
</p>
<p>have been generally excited, and which every one
</p>
<p>must allow are at least plausibly grounded. On the
</p>
<p>contrary, he is compelled to say, that the course of
</p>
<p>events,' and further investigation, have brought full
</p>
<p>confirmation to the truth of the charge.
</p>
<p>No one who has turned his attention to the subject
</p>
<p>can fail to have observed that the Roman Catholic

</p>
<p>journals preserve a rigid silence on thesubject of the
</p>
<p>Austrian St. Leopold Foundation, and the alleged
</p>
<p>conspiracy against our civil institutions, through the
</p>
<p>12 PRKI'ACE.
</p>
<p>instrumentality of the Catholic religion. Would an
</p>
<p>accusation that was groundless, so seriously implica-
</p>
<p>ting any Protestant sect with foreign political move-
</p>
<p>ments, be suffered to agitate the whole country for
</p>
<p>live or six moi tr.s, without producing from the sect
</p>
<p>thus accused a prompt and satisfactory explanation?
</p>
<p>No publication of the Roman Catholics attempting
</p>
<p>to refute the charge has, to the author's knowledge,
</p>
<p>been put forth, nor has there been, (with a single ex-
</p>
<p>ception, which he will presently examine,) any dis-
</p>
<p>claimer of principles hostile to our free institutions.
</p>
<p>Silence, it Vvoald seem, has been the word of com-
</p>
<p>mand on this subject, from head-quarters ; and from
</p>
<p>Maine to Louisiana, throughout the Roman Catholic
</p>
<p>ranks, with that perfectness of discipline for Avhicl
</p>
<p>this despotic sect is famous, the Avord of command is
</p>
<p>strictly obeyed. Neither in the daily political jour-
</p>
<p>Dais under their inlluence (and there are many that
</p>
<p>tire evidently in their interest) has there appeared
</p>
<p>any thing in the way of refutation of the charge of
</p>
<p>conspiracy, except a sneer at its improbabilitv, or a
</p>
<p>gratuitous imputation of bigotry and intolerance,
</p>
<p>against the writer.
</p>
<p>Many who think, with the author, that there Is im-
</p>
<p>minent danger to our free institutions from the in-
</p>
<p>crease of foreign Catholics, and from their despotic
</p>
<p>organization throughout these States, are yet unwil-
</p>
<p>ling to believe that Austria and other foreign despotic
</p>
<p>powers can have any settled design to subvert,
</p>
<p>through the instrumentality of the Catholic religion,
</p>
<p>(he Democratic institutions of the country. Had any
</p>
<p>thing more than mere dissent on this charge been
</p>
<p>hazarded, the author could better strengthen any as-

<p>sailed point. He is not aware of any w^eak spot in
</p>
<p>the chain of argument, or in the evidence by which
</p>
<p>he sustains his owm belief, and he therefore must
</p>
<p>have recourse to conjecture for possible objections to
</p>
<p>its general credence.
</p>
<p>What c(3ncurrence of circumstances, aside from
</p>
<p>confession oftheplot. is sufficient to prove conspiracy?
</p>
<p>Is not the case proved if it can be shown,
</p>
<p>PREFACE. 13
</p>
<p>1st. That there exists an adequate motive to con-
</p>
<p>spire ?
</p>
<p>2d. That there exists ample means wherewith to
</p>
<p>conspire ?
</p>
<p>And 3d. That means capable of accomplishing
</p>
<p>the object of conspiracy are actually employed by
</p>
<p>those whose interest it is to conspire ?
</p>
<p>No one in the case before us can expect a confes-
</p>
<p>sion from the conspirators ; let us have recourse
</p>
<p>then to the test proposed.
</p>
<p>1. Have Austria and the Holy Alliance an ade-
</p>
<p>quate motive for conspiring against the liberties of
</p>
<p>the United States ? Can there be a stronger motive
</p>
<p>than that of self-preservation? So certain as this
</p>
<p>country exists in prosperity under its present demo-
</p>
<p>cratic form of government, just so certain will its
</p>
<p>example operate on the people of Europe, as it has
</p>
<p>for two centuries operated, and is now in an acceler-
</p>
<p>ated degree operating, to subvert the ancient oppres-
</p>
<p>sive systems of government of the old world. The
</p>
<p>strongest motive, therefore, that can influence gov-
</p>
<p>ernments as well as individuals, that of self-preser-
</p>
<p>vation^ impels Austria and the other despots of Eu-
</p>
<p>rope to seek, by any means in their potoer, the sub-
</p>
<p>version of this government.
</p>
<p>2. Have they the means to conspire? No one can
</p>
<p>doubt that the usual means of conspiracy, money ^ and
</p>
<p>intriguing agents^ are perfectly at the command of
</p>
<p>those governments who can lavish their millions for
</p>
<p>the sole purpose of protecting their thrones, who keep
</p>
<p>in their pay for this vital object, standing armies, and
</p>
<p>a police of lens of thousands of spies.
</p>
<p>3. Have they then employed, or are they actually

</p>
<p>employing means capable of accomplishing their ob-
</p>
<p>ject in this country ? Austria, in a combination with
</p>
<p>other powers, called the St. Leopold Foundation, has
</p>
<p>sent, and is still sending both money and agents to
</p>
<p>this country ; the former comes in the shape of reli-
</p>
<p>gious contributions to this St. Leopold Foundation, the
</p>
<p>Society in Vienna, established with express refer-
</p>
<p>ence to operations in the United States ; the latter
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>14 PREFACK.
</p>
<p>come from the same quarter, in the shape of hun-
</p>
<p>dreds of Jesuits and priests; a class of men notori-
</p>
<p>ous for their intrigue and political arts, and who have
</p>
<p>a complete military organization through the United
</p>
<p>States. The Catholic religion is the cloak which
</p>
<p>covers the design.
</p>
<p>All the circumstances, therefore, necessary lo prove
</p>
<p>conspiracy, concur in fixing this charge upon Austria,
</p>
<p>and her associates in that Union of Christian Prin-
</p>
<p>ces, combined in the St, Leopold Foundation. Is
</p>
<p>there any defect in the test I have applied, or in its
</p>
<p>application ? Will it be said, that by this rule the
</p>
<p>United Slates can be proved to have politically con-
</p>
<p>spired against India; because Protestant American
</p>
<p>Missionaries have been sent to India, to convert the
</p>
<p>people to Christianity ? Let us apply the test, and see
</p>
<p>if conspiracy can be proved. Aside from the fact
</p>
<p>that the United States as a government cannot, as do
</p>
<p>other governments, engage in a religious enterprise,
</p>
<p>the peculiarity in its principles of the separation of
</p>
<p>Church and State, making it unconstitutional, and
</p>
<p>therefore impossible, I ask what adequate motive ex-
</p>
<p>ists here for such a crusade ? what have the United
</p>
<p>States to fear politically from India ? It is scarcely
</p>
<p>necessary to answer, nothing. The proof fails, there-
</p>
<p>fore, in the first rule, in regard to conspiracy by the
</p>
<p>United States.
</p>
<p>But some may say, although we can easily per-
</p>
<p>ceive that the Austrian system and our own are di-
</p>
<p>ametrically opposed, and that it may be, therefore, in
</p>
<p>a general sense, for the interest of Austria to extin-
</p>
<p>guish the liberties of this country, yet where is your
</p>
<p>proof that she has ever so far interested herself in the

</p>
<p>political character of this country, or considered the
</p>
<p>example of this government in so alarming a light,
</p>
<p>as to make it a serious object to destroy its influence
</p>
<p>on Europe? Can you prove that she has ever con-
</p>
<p>sidered American institutions so dangerous to the ex-
</p>
<p>istence of her own, as to authorize you to use so
</p>
<p>strong terms as self-preservation, in relation to the
</p>
<p>degree of interest she has in the event expected, and

</p>
<p>conspiracy in relation to measures she is using, m
</p>
<p>this country ? These are important points, and I will
</p>
<p>examine them. As to the use of the term se//-/)re-
</p>
<p>servalion, it might be a sufficient justification to re-
</p>
<p>fer generally to the Austrian policy, in regard to a!'.-
</p>
<p>countries, over, and in which she can exercise an'^
</p>
<p>control. Her interference in Saxony, (see page 48,)
</p>
<p>to control the press, on the principle of self-preserva-
</p>
<p>tion, is a case in point ; but her interference at this
</p>
<p>moment to resist the progress of democratic opinions
</p>
<p>in Switzerland on the same principle, fully proves
</p>
<p>that she is sensibly alive to every movement in the
</p>
<p>political world which tends in the slightest degree to
</p>
<p>weaken the structure of her arbitrary system.
</p>
<p>As to the other term, conspiracy, if any still
</p>
<p>think it too strong in relation to the operations of
</p>
<p>Austria in this country, I trust their opinion will be
</p>
<p>changed by considering the following facts: 
</p>
<p>In the year 1828, the celebrated Frederick Schlegel,
</p>
<p>one of the most distinguished literary men of Europe,^
</p>
<p>delivered lectures at Vienna, on the Philosophy of
</p>
<p>History, (which have not been translated into Eng-
</p>
<p>lish,) a sreat object of which is to show the mutual
</p>
<p>support ichich Popery and Monarchy derive from
</p>
<p>each other. He commends the two systems in con-
</p>
<p>nexion, as deserving of universal reception. Ha
</p>
<p>attempts to prove that sciences, and arts, and all the
</p>
<p>pursuits of man as an intellectual being, are best
</p>
<p>promoted under this perfect system of church and
</p>
<p>state ; a Pope at the head of the former ; an Em-
</p>
<p>peror at the head of the latter. He contrasts \vhh

<p>this, the system of Protestantism ; represents Pro-

<p>testantism as the enemy of good government, as the
</p>
<p>ally of Republicanism, as the parent of the distresses
</p>
<p>of Europe, as the cause of all the disorders with
</p>
<p>which legitimate governments are afflicted. In the
</p>
<p>close of lecture ITth, vol. ii. p. 286, he thus speaks
</p>
<p>of this country :  " The true nursery of all these 
</p>
<p>destructive principles, the revolutionary school -^
</p>
<p>for France and the rest of Europe, has been
</p>
<p>North America. Thence the evil has spread over"
</p>
<p>16 PREFACE,
</p>
<p>' many other lands, either by natural contagion, or
</p>
<p>by arbitrary communication.^^
</p>
<p>Let it be remembered that it was in Vienna, in
</p>
<p>182S, where opinions so flattering to the pride of
</p>
<p>legitimacy Avere publicly preached by one of the
</p>
<p>first scholars of the age, where the United States
</p>
<p>was held up to the execration of his Austrian audi-
</p>
<p>tors as the ' nursery of destructive 'principlesy as
</p>
<p>ihe " revolutionary school for Europe,^'' as, in truth,
</p>
<p>the great central fire which threatened the rest of the
</p>
<p>world, and which must be put out, ere European
</p>
<p>governments could rest in safety. Let it then also
</p>
<p>"^ be borne in mind that it was in Vienna, in 1829,
</p>
<p>^ immediately after these opinions were promulgated,
</p>
<p>^while the influence of Schlegel's eloquent appeals
</p>
<p>"^^was still fresh, that the St. Leopold Foundation
</p>
<p>was set on foot for the purpose [to use the language
</p>
<p>\ of its own reports] ^''of promoting the greater activ-
</p>
<p>itij of Catholic missions in the United States."
</p>
<p>Here, then, we have doctrines advanced in Aus-
</p>
<p>tria, that Monarchy and Popery mutually sustain
</p>
<p>each other, that Republicanism and Protestaiitism
</p>
<p>also mutually sustain each other, and that the great
</p>
<p>niftsery of this hated Republicanism is these United
</p>
<p>States; and immediately consequent on the promul-
</p>
<p>gation of these opinions, a great Society is formed,
</p>
<p>with the Emperor of Austria for its patron, the
</p>
<p>counsellor of State, Prince Metternich, its grand
</p>
<p>^manager, and all the officers of State the zealous
</p>
<p>promoters of the design, and engaged in the instant
</p>
<p>vigorous diffusion of Popery in this country. Now
</p>
<p>what is the intention of Austria in spreading in this

<p>country Popery, the natural ally of Monarchical

<p>government? With the facts of the case before
</p>
<p>them, the people will not be slow in forming their
</p>
<p>judgment of the nature of this ostensibly religious
</p>
<p>enterprise, and whether the term conspiracy is too
</p>
<p>strong to apply to this insidious attempt.
</p>
<p>But who, after all, is Frederick Schlegel? He
</p>
<p>may be a great scholar, but what is his situation
</p>
<p>that so much weight is to be attached to his opin-
</p>
<p>PREFACE. 17
</p>
<p>ions ? I will give my readers a brief account
</p>
<p>of him, abridged from the Encyclopedia America-
</p>
<p>na, (edited by a German.) sufficient to enable them
</p>
<p>to judge if too much stress is laid upon his opin-
</p>
<p>ions. "Frederick Schlegel, (one of the great lite-
</p>
<p>rary stars of Germany,) went over to the Catholic
</p>
<p>faith, at Cologne, and in the year ISOO repaired
</p>
<p>to Vienna. In 1809, he received an appointment at
</p>
<p>the head-quarters of the Archduke Charles, where
</p>
<p>he drew up several powerful proclamations. When
</p>
<p>peace was concluded, he again delivered lectures in
</p>
<p>Vienna on modern history and the literature of all
</p>
<p>nations. In 1812, he published the German Museum,
</p>
<p>and gained the conjidence of Prince Metternich by
</p>
<p>various diplomatic papers, in consequence of which
</p>
<p>he was appointed Austrian counsellor of legation at
</p>
<p>the Diet in Frankfort. In 1818, he returned to
</p>
<p>Vienna, where he lived as Secretary of the Court,
</p>
<p>and Counsellor of Legation, and published a view
</p>
<p>of the Present Political .Re/a?/o5 [of Austria,] and
</p>
<p>his complete works." In 1828, he delivered his lec-

<p>considered as implicated in this Conspiiacy ? This
</p>
<p>is indeed a grave question, and one which demands
</p>
<p>serious attention, lest ^ve should be, on the one hand,
</p>
<p>too regardless of danger from them, and on the other,
</p>
<p>unjust to those who are innocent. We are told that

<p>they disclaim hostility to our free government, that
</p>
<p>they profess the warmest friendship to our demoH

<p>been, and are now, many true patriots among^ this
</p>
<p>sect, many estimable men of sound political views,,
</p>
<p>sincere in supporting ihe democratic institutions oi
</p>
<p>the country ; but making the most ample allowance,
</p>
<p>they are but exceptions to the rule. The sect, as a
</p>
<p>sect, is still justly chargeable with the tendency of
</p>
<p>its acknowledged principles. If a Roman Catholic
</p>
<p>in the United States is a Democratic Republican^
</p>
<p>he is so in spite of and in opposition to^ the system
</p>
<p>of his churchy and not in accordance with if. To
</p>
<p>the truth of this fact, the arguments of Schlegel, a
</p>
<p>Catholic, and the profoundest investigator of the sub
</p>
<p>ject in the present age, are unanswerably conclusive
</p>
<p>From their principles of passive obedience, and the
</p>
<p>denial of the right of private judgment alone, Ro
</p>
<p>man Catholics, as' a sect, must be ignorant and will
</p>
<p>ing slaves to the schen)es of any despotic ecclesi
</p>
<p>astic that ^ foreign power may see fit to send to this
</p>
<p>country to rule over thern. The secret plans, the
</p>
<p>real designs of the Jesuits may be confined to feAV
</p>
<p>bosoms, it is by no means necessary that the mass
</p>
<p>of the sect should have any knowledge of the plot ,
</p>
<p>for from the nature of their system they may be blind
</p>
<p>instruments of the few.
</p>
<p>Popery and despotism are notoriously united m the
</p>
<p>Austrian government, and Protestantism and Re-
</p>
<p>publicanism in that of the United States. At the
</p>
<p>ti'.r.e I adduced arguments to prove the truth of these
</p>
<p>two categories, I y/as wholly unapprized that so dis
</p>
<p>tinguished a political writer as Schlegei had taken
</p>
<p>the same view^s of these opposite systems, to rouse
</p>
<p>Austrians to the defence of their own category. A
</p>
<p>powerful argument is derived from this corroboration

<p>of an important political truth, by Schlegel, who
</p>
<p>writes in the interest of absolutism, to urge all true
</p>
<p>friends of liberty on this side of the water, to the
</p>
<p>vigorous maintenance of the American category. It
</p>
<p>is a truth now no longer to be questioned, that Po-
</p>
<p>pery is so naturally the ally of Absolute government,
</p>
<p>that the diffusion of the former will result in produ-
</p>
<p>cing the latter j and it is equally true, that the dif-
</p>
<p>PREFACE. 19
</p>
<p>fusion of Protestantism will result in the producfion
</p>
<p>of liberal institutions. What, then, is the duty of
</p>
<p>Americans, all who really love their own free system
</p>
<p>of government ? There can be but one answer.
</p>
<p>They must unite in giving every facility to the spread
</p>
<p>of Protestant principles. Patriotism demands that
</p>
<p>every Protestant religious sect be encouraged to pro-
</p>
<p>mote its own views, each according to the dictates
</p>
<p>of conscience ; and patriotism equally demands the
</p>
<p>discouragement^ in every lawful way, of the further
</p>
<p>introduction of Popery and Popish influence into the
</p>
<p>country. Popery is the antagonist to o\xr free sys-
</p>
<p>tem. No one can doubt that the unusual efforts of
</p>
<p>despotic foreign governments to spread Popery in
</p>
<p>the United States, has for its principal design the
</p>
<p>subversion of our republican institutions. Ought a
</p>
<p>vaunted but spurious charity to be allowed tJ blind
</p>
<p>the eyes of Americans to the evidence of the attack
</p>
<p>made upon them ? ought they to aid these foreign
</p>
<p>conspirators, by adding their own contributions to
</p>
<p>the means of spreading Popery ? ought they to en-
</p>
<p>courage the schools of Jesuit agents; their immoral
</p>
<p>nunnery systems; their slave-making seminaries, by
</p>
<p>placing American children within the pale of their
</p>
<p>discipline? ought they to court Jesuit influence in
</p>
<p>our politics, and screen their political principles from
</p>
<p>examination, on the plea that this is merely a reli-
</p>
<p>gious controversy ? Let patriotism answer these
</p>
<p>questions.
</p>
<p>I will now examine the disclaimer of hostility to
</p>
<p>our republican institutions, (to which I have alluded,)
</p>
<p>made in behalf of the Catholics in this countrv, by

<p>CATHOLIC DISCLAIMER.

<p>"We have no doubt that the Roman Catholics
</p>
<p>have their due share of proselyting spirit. Some of
</p>
<p>our good people, clergy and laity, would have a
</p>

<p>of that spirit. But the cry is  ' Corispiracy against

</p>
<p>lowing confession of political faith pass for what it
</p>
<p>is worth. There is nothing in it which sounds like
</p>
<p>what we call by the odious epithet Jesuitical ; and
</p>
<p>we do not ourselves question the sincerity of the
</p>
<p>avowal with which it closes; an avowal similar to
</p>
<p>one which Catholics in England have made on like
</p>
<p>occasions."  Christian Register.

</p>
<p>which he held, the Catholics of this country now

<p>hold. They ileem the constitution as sacred, and

</p>
<p>This is the disclaimer, the only one I have yet
</p>
<p>seen, and which seems so far satisfactory to the
</p>
<p>Editor of the Register, that he sees nothing in it
</p>
<p>which " sounds Jesuitical." To me, Jesuitism wag
</p>
<p>never more evident. It is permitted to scrutinize
</p>
<p>with more than common care, a Jesuit document ;
</p>
<p>but in the present case there needs no scrutiny.

<p>the blindness of any one who professes not to see it.

<p>distinction to justice and the pjiblic interest; but it
</p>
<p>is not of a nature to invite the refecting part of

<p>the world, and shoios, at least, that it has evils ?"
</p>
<p>It wjs politic, be it remarked, bat yesterday, (before
</p>
<p>this subject had created so much excitement,) for
</p>
<p>this same Catholic Telegraph to hold this identical
</p>
<p>anti-republican, anti-American language, with the
</p>
<p>addition of his opinion, that ''the system of Ameri-
</p>
<p>can Institvtions was condemned by numerous other
</p>
<p>proofs." To-day, however, the Catholic leaders find
</p>
<p>it politic to play republican ; because the people are
</p>
<p>wakinij to a sense of danger to their liberties, and
</p>
<p>the artifices of the Jesuits through the land are no
</p>
<p>longer regarded with inditTerence.
</p>
<p>A disclaimer on the part of the Roman Cath.olics,
</p>
<p>of hostility to republican institutions, is a matter of
</p>
<p>loo serious importance, just now, to be left to be in-
</p>
<p>ferred from ambiguous expressions ; it must come in
</p>
<p>a more formal and responsible shape, than that of a
</p>
<p>paragraph in a journal, of such contradictory views.
</p>
<p>A disclaimer of anti-republican principles, of prin-
</p>
<p>ciples in direct and dangerous opposition to those of
</p>
<p>this government, with v.'hich the Papal system is
</p>
<p>directly and distinctly charged, must be a frank, un-
</p>
<p>ambiguous manifesto, that will bear scrutiny, issuing
</p>
<p>from an authority unquestioned. It must embrace
</p>
<p>a disclaimer o^ foreign allegiance, of hostility to
</p>
<p>freedom of the press, io liberty of opinion, to liberty
</p>
<p>of conscience. It must contain satisfactory evidence
</p>
<p>that these anti-American principles are expunged,
</p>
<p>and expunged for ever, from the Roman Catholic
</p>
<p>system. These are some of the essential points to

<p>be met, and they must be met without evasion. And
</p>
<p>until this is done, the people of this country are fairly
</p>
<p>borne out in regarding Roman Catholics essentially
</p>
<p>and necessarily, enemies to her free government^
</p>
<p>and most especially to the democratic republican in-
</p>
<p>stitutions of this country ; nor will they be blinded
</p>
<p>to this truth by the representation industriously
</p>
<p>pressed upon them, that the Catholic population of
</p>
<p>22 PREFACE.
</p>
<p>this country, are 7iow, (whether trui^ or feignedly.
</p>
<p>It matters not,) in favor of repuhlican institutions, or
</p>
<p>that the foreigners among them, are now heard more
</p>
<p>vociferous than native citizens, in their huzzas, on
</p>
<p>all patriotic occasions, and in praises of civil and re-
</p>
<p>ligious liberty.
</p>
<p>The course of many of our daily journals, on this
</p>
<p>subject, is one demanding severe reprehension from
</p>
<p>the American people. They are conspicuously busy
</p>
<p>in making the impression, that the excitement now
</p>
<p>general through the country respecting Popery, is
</p>
<p>the result of a sudden disposition to persecute the
</p>
<p>Catholics ; that it is a sectarian and proscriptive war
</p>
<p>upon them, the fruits of an intolerant, bigoted, fa-
</p>
<p>natical spirit, and the revival of ancient prejudices.
</p>
<p>These are accusations daily reiterated. We have
</p>
<p>fallen on strange times, indeed, when subjects of the
</p>
<p>deepest political importance to the country may not
</p>
<p>be mooted in the political journals of the day with-
</p>
<p>out meeting the indiscriminating hostility and de-
</p>
<p>nunciations of such journals; without hints and even
</p>
<p>threats of popular vengeance, unless we abstain from
</p>
<p>discussing exciting subjects ; as if all great questions
</p>
<p>touching our liberties could be otherwise than ex-
</p>
<p>citing. "Oue, would have all debating societies sup-
</p>
<p>pressed, even by mobs. Others liberally charge
</p>
<p>illiberality, bigotry, and intolerance on all who ven-
</p>
<p>ture publicly to \yVite against Popery, and little con-
</p>
<p>scious of their own sins of the same character, are
</p>
<p>bigoted against bigotry, and intolerant againt intoler-

<p>made against any and all Protestant sects, while^

</p>
<p>from peaceably assembling to discuss the political
</p>
<p>question of Popery, by threats of outrage, as at Phil-
</p>
<p>adelphia ; and in these cases, where are the sympa-
</p>
<p>thies of the press ? Does it raise the cry of illiber-
</p>
<p>aliiy, and intolerance, and persecution, and bigotry
</p>
<p>against the Roman Catholic aggressors ; does it de-
</p>
<p>fend the sacred right of freedom of discussion thus
</p>
<p>alarmingly invacjj^. No ! its terms of reproach are
</p>
<p>exclusively reserved for those who venture to pub-
</p>
<p>lish these acts. These are epithets suited only to
</p>
<p>those Protestants who have the hardihood to main-
</p>
<p>tain that American necks are not yet prepared to
</p>
<p>wear the Popish yoke, the despotic chain offered by
</p>
<p>Austria, and commended to them by the royal de-
</p>
<p>votees of " the blessed St. Leopold." ' But, say some, .
</p>
<p>this is a religious controversy, and it is wrong to
</p>
<p>discuss it in the daily journals.' Is Popery a religious
</p>
<p>controversy 1 Let us see. The St. Leopold Foun-
</p>
<p>dation is asserted to be a political combination of
</p>
<p>foreign powers, founded with a view to the over-
</p>
<p>throw of our republican government. If despotism
</p>
<p>approaches us in the garb of religion, is it the less to
</p>
<p>be resisted ? Have we no political interest in the truth
</p>
<p>or falsity of this fact ? Is this a religious or a polit-
</p>
<p>ical question ? The agents of this society are as-
</p>
<p>serted to be political agents sent to this country in
</p>
<p>the disguise of religious missionaries. Is this a re-
</p>
<p>ligious or a 'political question ? The present Pope

<p>they not owe him an allegiance superior to any due

<p>together different from our own school system. What
</p>
<p>is the nature of this foreign system? Is it favorable
</p>
<p>or adverse to liberty ? And are these religious or
</p>
<p>political questions ? Foreign emigrants are flocking
</p>
<p>to our shores in increased numbers, two thirds at
</p>
<p>least are Roman Catholics, and of the most ignorant
</p>
<p>classes, and thus pauperism and crime are alarmingly
</p>
<p>increased. The Irish Catholics in an especial man-
</p>
<p>ner clan tosrether, keep themselves distinct from the
</p>
<p>American family, exercise the political privileges
</p>
<p>granted to them by our hospitality,^ot as Americans,
</p>
<p>but as Irishmen, keep alive their foreign feelings,
</p>
<p>their foreign associations, habits, and manners. Is
</p>
<p>this mixture and these doings favorable or unfavor-
</p>
<p>able to American character, and national independ-
</p>
<p>ence ? and is ihis a religious or a political question 1
</p>
<p>It would be easy to add to this list of questions pure-

<p>ly political^ which are involved in the mixed system
</p>
<p>of Popery ; and are editors who cry out against the
</p>
<p>Popish controversy so ill-informed of the character
</p>
<p>of this Church and State sect, that they are unable
</p>
<p>to distinguish the political from the religious ques-
</p>
<p>tions ? Has Popery so cloaked itself in sacredness,
</p>
<p>has this political engine of foreign despotism so
</p>
<p>sanctified its very name, that our press is awe-struck
</p>
<p>at its movements, and cries sacrilege if its political
</p>
<p>claims to our reception be in the slightest degree
</p>
<p>disputed ? Whence come all the sorrows and regrets
</p>
<p>about controversy, and lamentations and whinings
</p>
<p>about intolerance, because freemen are jealous of the

<p>enterprise, and to question the pureiy benevolent na-
</p>
<p>ture of their imperial majesties' love for our souls 7
</p>
<p>It is a subject of deep interest indeed, to the coni-
</p>
<p>munity, to know how far our press is inoculated with
</p>
<p>this no-controversy spirit; this truly papal spirit;
</p>
<p>this emphatically anti-American spirit. How is it
</p>
<p>that our free principles of government have been
</p>
<p>brought out, and set before the world, but by free,
</p>
<p>unembarrassed discussion ; by controversy, by sharp
</p>
<p>controversy, by the collision of intellect with intel-
</p>
<p>lect. It is in the skilful conflict of mind with mind,
</p>
<p>that truth is elicited ; it is by the friction of keen de-
</p>
<p>bate, that the rust of error is kept from gathering over,
</p>
<p>and corroding away vital truths. Better, far better,
</p>
<p>occasionally to endure even the excesses of the storm,
</p>
<p>so necessary to scatter the noxious vapors of the at-
</p>
<p>mosphere, than to purchase a fatal repose by dwelling
</p>
<p>in the quiet but pestilential atmosphere of a tomb.
</p>
<p>Is it the spirit of liberty or of despotism, that now
</p>
<p>frowns upon free inquiry, that would shut cut debate
</p>
<p>from the secular press, by the deceptive cry of reli-
</p>
<p>gious controversy ? Who are they that are dreading
</p>
<p>and shrinking from examination? Who that caution all
</p>
<p>those over whom they have power, " against attend-
</p>
<p>ing upon, or taking part in, or noticing meetings,"
</p>
<p>for the discussion of the political question of Pope-
</p>
<p>ry? Ah ! is this the tender point? Is it when the
</p>
<p>political question is proposed for public debate, that
</p>
<p>Popish Bishops, _^r5^ take the alarm, and the spirit-
</p>
<p>ual jurisdiction is pa.'-aded forth, and the spiritual
</p>
<p>power exercised, to prevent their subjects from exer-
</p>
<p>cising their political privileges ?* May the religious

<p>under their jurisdiction !. to refrain from attending on the discussions

<p>Started, with which as Bishops they have nothing
</p>
<p>to do, that they fuhninate their spiritual thunders
</p>
<p>against those who agitate the subject ? And is it in
</p>
<p>such intermeddling with politics, that they are up-
</p>
<p>held by the Protestant press? Is our press indeed in
</p>
<p>awe of Popish bishops ? Does it fear to touch the
</p>
<p>civil character of Popery, for fear of giving offence to
</p>
<p>Popish bishops ? Truth has nothing to fear from the
</p>
<p>severest scrutiny. It is error that loves- mystery ; that
</p>
<p>seeks concealment ; that shrouds itself in secrecy,
</p>
<p>and cries out persecution ! Yes, persecution, for-
</p>
<p>sooth, if any one attempts to drag it into the light.
</p>
<p>It was error that the poet aptly describes as
</p>
<p>seeing one in mail,
</p>
<p>Armed to point, sought back to turn again ;
</p>
<p>For light she hated as the deadly bale,
</p>
<p>Aye, wont in desert darkness to remain,
</p>
<p>Where plain, none might her see, nor she see any plain.
</p>
<p>This is a matter not to be covered up by silence.
</p>
<p>The political press has a fearful responsibility now
</p>
<p>resting upon it ; it has a sacred duty to the country to
</p>
<p>perform, from which it cannot, must not shrink. It
</p>
<p>should be known, that there is a wider desire for
</p>
<p>knowledge on Popery, in its multifarious bearings
</p>
<p>upon society, than some seem to be aAvare of, and es-
</p>
<p>pecially in its effect upon our civil institutions ; a de-
</p>
<p>sire, which, having been created by the necessity of
</p>
<p>the times, (by the fact of unusual efforts made by
</p>
<p>foreign governments, hostile to our institutions, to
</p>
<p>spread throughout the country, Popery)m\ist be sat-
</p>
<p>isfied.
</p>
<p>The political character of Popery is a legitimate
</p>
<p>subject of discussion in the secular press, and we be-

<p>lieve that when the intelligent conductors of our jour-
</p>
<p>nals shall have justly apprehended that part of the
</p>
<p>mixed system of Popery which belongs to it as a po-

<p>litical system, they will no longer be deterred by the
</p>
<p>senseless cry of religious controversy, from lending

<p>their columns and their pens for its fearless discus-

<p>PREFATORY REMARKS.
</p>
<p>The following Numbers, written for the New-
</p>
<p>Vork Observer in the beginning of the year 1834,
</p>
<p>and duriog several weeks of confinement by indispo-
</p>
<p>sition, have been, perhaps, more extensively copied
</p>
<p>into the religious journals of the different Christian
</p>
<p>denominations, than any communications, (with,
</p>
<p>perhaps, a single exception,) of the same extent,
</p>
<p>since the establishment of religious newspapers;
</p>
<p>and although the subject matter is almost altogether
</p>
<p>political, giving proofs of a serious foreign con-
</p>
<p>spiracy against the government, yet the writer is not
</p>
<p>aware that a single secular journal in the United
</p>
<p>States has taken the pains to investigate the matter,
</p>
<p>or even to ask if indeed there may not be good
</p>
<p>grounds for believing it true. The silence of the
</p>
<p>secular press on a subjecT which has roused the
</p>
<p>attention of so large a body of the Protestant com-
</p>
<p>munity, may indeed be accounted for in part, perhaps
</p>
<p>altogether, from the all-engrossing election contests
</p>
<p>which have agitated the country from one extremity
</p>
<p>of the land to the other ; for the writer would cer-
</p>
<p>tainly be very reluctant to adopt the belief which
</p>
<p>has repeatedly been urged upon him by many, that
</p>
<p>the secular journals dare not attack Popery ; he
</p>
<p>will not believe that dare not ever stood in the way
</p>
<p>of the duty of any patriotic, independent conductor of
</p>
<p>the American press.*
</p>
<p>At the solicitation of many citizens, without dis-
</p>
<p>tinction of religious denomination or of political
</p>
<p> A friend, to whom this part was read, smiled, and said, " You are
</p>
<p>sufficiently guarded in your language, but how many patriotic^ inde-
</p>
<p>pendent conductora of the American press are there] Can you

<p>30 PREFATOnY REMARKS.
</p>
<p>party, tlie writer has consented to collect the num-
</p>
<p>bers into a pamphlet, adding notes illustrative of
</p>
<p>many matters which could not so well have been
</p>
<p>introduced into the columns of a newspaper.
</p>
<p>That a vigorous and unexampled effort is making
</p>
<p>by the despotic governments of Europe to cause
</p>
<p>Popery to overspread this country, is a fact too pal-
</p>
<p>pable to be contradicted. Did not official documents
</p>
<p>lately published put this fact beyond dispute, yet the
</p>
<p>writer had personal evidence sufficient to convince
</p>
<p>him of the fact, and of the political object of the
</p>
<p>enterprise, while residing in Italy in the years
</p>
<p>1S30-31, from conversations with nobles and gentle-
</p>
<p>men of different countries, with the officers of vari-
</p>
<p>ous foreign governments, visiting and resident in the
</p>
<p>Roman and Austrian states, and with priests and
</p>
<p>other ecclesiastics of the Roman faith. Sometimes
</p>
<p>it was hinted to him as a check to too sanguine anti-
</p>
<p>cipations of the triumph of the experiment of our
</p>
<p>democratic republican government ; sometimes it
</p>
<p>was told him by the former class, in a tone of ex-
</p>
<p>ultation, that a cause was in operation which would
</p>
<p>surely overthrow our institutions and gradually bring
</p>
<p>us under a form of government less obnoxious to the
</p>
<p>pride, and less dangerous to the existence of the
</p>
<p>antiquated despotic systems of Europe. In addition to
</p>
<p>these hints to the writer concerning the efforts making
</p>
<p>by the governments of Europe to carry Popery through
</p>
<p>all our borders, other American travellers will tes-
</p>
<p>tify to similar hints made to them. By one, I am
</p>
<p>permitted to say, that the celebrated naturalist,
</p>
<p>the late Baron Cuvier, known also as a zealous
</p>
<p>Protestant, inquired of him with marks of concern, ii

</p>
<p>it were indeed true that Popery had made such pro-
</p>
<p>gress in the United States as to cause the exultation
</p>
<p>(which, it seems, was no secret,) among the legiti-
</p>
<p>mates of Europe. And again, that a distinguished
</p>
<p>member of one of the Protestant German embassies
</p>
<p>in Rome also made similar inquiries of him, havirig
</p>
<p>heard much boasting of the progress of Popery in
</p>
<p>the United States, adding this pertinent remark,

<p>" thny will be hammer or nails, sir ; they will per-
</p>
<p>secute or be persecuted.''' These facts may be of
</p>
<p>so much importance in aid of the other proofs of a
</p>
<p>conspiracy Avhich these numbers unfold, as to show
</p>
<p>that among the various higher classes of Europe the
</p>
<p>enterprise of a Popish crusade in this country is not
</p>
<p>only a subject of notoriety, but is viewed with great
</p>
<p>interest, and is considered as having a most import-
</p>
<p>ant political bearing.
</p>
<p>In the following numbers, the writer has chosen to
</p>
<p>rest the evidence of conspiracy mainly on official
</p>
<p>documents published in Vienna, because they have
</p>
<p>been translated and published,* and are within the
</p>
<p>reach of any citizen of the country who chooses more
</p>
<p>closely to examine them. He has also availed him-
</p>
<p>self of facts in the operations of Popish agents in this
</p>
<p>country, so far as their workings have been occasion-
</p>
<p>ally revealed.
</p>
<p>The writer will add in conclusion, that he writes
</p>
<p>not in the interest of a sect or a party, for the ques-
</p>
<p>tion of Popery is not identified with either political
</p>
<p>party. He has lived too long in foreign countries to
</p>
<p>be able to identify himself with the local interests of
</p>
<p>mere party at home, whether in religion or politics.
</p>
<p>The great cZewocra^/c features of his country's insti-
</p>
<p>tutions, as contradistinguished from the despotic,
</p>
<p>monarchical, and aristocratic systems of Europe,
</p>
<p>were admired by him as they appeared more boldly
</p>
<p>relieved, viewed from abroad in such striking con-
</p>
<p>trast to all around him ; and he is thoroughly per-
</p>
<p>suaded that these democratic institutions, if suffered
</p>
<p>to have their unobstructed course, unobstructed ex-
</p>
<p>cept by the natural checks of education and religion,

</p>
<p>more favorable to civil liberty and to the final tri-

<p>the country, and to conjure them, as they value their
</p>
<p>civil and religious institutions, to watch the Protean
</p>
<p>shapes of Popery, to suspect and fear it most when
</p>
<p>it allies itself to our interests in the guise of a friend.
</p>
<p>Mistrust of all that Popery does, or affects to doy
</p>
<p>whether as a friend or foe, in any part of the coun-
</p>
<p>try^ is the only feeling that true charity^ universal
</p>
<p>charity, allows us to indulge.

<p>of personal ambition, from thirst for national
</p>
<p>glory, from desire of territorial increase, or from
</p>
<p>other local causes, we might safely be igno-
</p>
<p>rant both of cause and result. No armed bands
</p>
<p>of a conqueror flushed with victory could give
</p>
<p>us a moment's alarm. But in a war of opin-
</p>
<p>ions, in a war of principles, in which the very
</p>
<p>foundations of government are subverted, and
</p>
<p>the whole social fabric upturned, we cannot, if
</p>
<p>we would, be uninterested in the result. Prin-
</p>
<p>ciples are not bounded by geographical limits.

<p>Oceans present to them no barriers. All of

<p>diplomacy, the contradictory measures, tht
</p>
<p>faithless promises of the despotic cabinets, all
</p>
<p>show that the war of principles has indeea
</p>
<p>commenced, and that Europe is agitated to iti
</p>
<p>very centre with the anxieties of the contest.
</p>
<p>No open annual message reveals franlily to
</p>
<p>all the world the true internal condition of the
</p>
<p>oppressed nations of Europe. From the well
</p>
<p>guarded walls of the secret council-chamber of
</p>
<p>the imperial power, documents seldom escape
</p>
<p>to shovv^ us the strength of the opposing prin-
</p>
<p>ciple. Despotism glosses over all its oppres-
</p>
<p>sions. The people are always happy under
</p>
<p>the paternal sway. They that plead for liberty
</p>
<p>are always enemies of public order. ' Order
</p>
<p>rei2:ns in Warsaw," was the proclamation that
</p>
<p>told the world that despotism had triumphed
</p>
<p>over Poland, and none now may know the
</p>
<p>number of her sons of freedom still at large,
</p>
<p>still unexiled to the mines of Siberia: yet it is
</p>
<p>great ; for Russia, and Prussia, and Austria
</p>
<p>have leagued anew against unconquerable Po-
</p>
<p>land ; and the agony of determination, the des-
</p>
<p>perate resolution which the Russian Autocrat
</p>
<p>has just uttered, tells the secret of the yet un-
</p>
<p>vanquished spirit of Polish patriots, and at the
</p>
<p>same time discloses the plot of mighty efforts^
</p>
<p>of united efforts^ of persevering efforts^ utterly
</p>
<p>to extinguish liberty.

<p>" As long as I live," says the Emperor, " I

<p>may require a hundred years ; I am not un-
</p>
<p>reasonable, I give you a whole age, but you
</p>
<p>must work without relaxation."
</p>
<p>This is language without ambiguity, bold,
</p>
<p>undisguised ; it is the clear and official disclo-
</p>
<p>sure of the determination of the Holy Alli-
</p>
<p>ance against liberty. It proclaims unextin-
</p>
<p>guishable hatred, a loill of iron. There is
</p>
<p>no compromise with hberty ; a hundred years
</p>
<p>of efforts unrelaxed, if necessary, shall be put
</p>
<p>forth to crush it for ever. Its very name must
</p>
<p>be blotted from the earth. What ! and is there
</p>
<p>a Holy Alliance, a " union of Christian prin-
</p>
<p>ces,'^ leagued to extinguish the kindling sparks
</p>
<p>of liberty in Europe ? and will they make no
</p>
<p>effort to quench the great altar-fires that blaze
</p>
<p>m their strength in the temples of this land of
</p>
<p>liberty? An oversight like this would seem
</p>
<p>to be too palpable for the wisdom of the despotic
</p>
<p>cabinets to commit. This conquest must be
</p>
<p>achieved, or liberty will never die in Europe.
</p>
<p>With declarations before us, thus officially
</p>
<p>put forth by despotism, of such exterminating
</p>
<p>hostility to liberty, is it not possible that an
</p>

<p>we have " entano;]ing alliances^ with none."
</p>
<p>Where, then, shall we look '? "What shape
</p>
<p>would attack be hkely to assume ? Let the
</p>
<p>nature of the contest aid us in the inquiry. It
</p>
<p>is the war of opinion ; the war of anta<i-onist
</p>
<p>principles ; the war of despotism asrainst lib

<p>erty. But how can this contest be carried on
</p>
<p>in this country? We have not the V\^arrinii
</p>
<p>opinions to set in array against each other
</p>
<p>One principle is certainly absent. We have no
</p>
<p>party in favor of despotism. This party is to

<p>be created. If then a scheme can be devised
</p>
<p>for sowing the seeds and rearing the plants of
</p>
<p>despotism, that is the scheme which would

<p>its designs against American hbert^^
</p>
<p>It isasked. Why should the Holy Alliance

<p>feel interested in the destruction of transatlan-

</p>
<p>and increasing influence of our institutions on
</p>
<p>Europe, is reason enough. The example alone
</p>
<p>of prosperity, which we exhibit in such strong
</p>
<p>contrast to the enslaved, priest ridden, tax-bur-
</p>
<p>dened despotisms of the old world, is sufficient
</p>
<p>to keep those countries in perpetual agitation.
</p>
<p>How can it be otherwise ? Will a sick man,
</p>
<p>long despairing of cure, learn that there is a
</p>
<p>rernedy for him, and not desire to procure it ?
</p>
<p>Will one born to think a dungeon his natural

<p>home, learn through his grated bars that man

<p>may be free, and not struggle to obtain his

<p>to counteract the evil.
</p>
<p>Let us look around us. Is despotism doing
</p>
<p>any thing in this country ? It becomes us to
</p>
<p>be jealous. We have cause to expect an at-

<p>character of the contest, the war of opinion.
</p>
<p>Yes ! despotism is doing somethino;. Avstria

</p>
<p>^ vised a grand scheme. She has organized a
</p>
<p>great plan for doing something here, wdiich

<p>she^ at least, deenis important. She has her
</p>
<p>Jesuit missionaries travelling through the land ;
</p>
<p>she has supplied them with money, and has
</p>
<p>furnished a fountain for a regular supply. She
</p>
<p>had expended a year ago more than seventy-
</p>
<p>four thousand dollars in furtherance of her
</p>
<p>design !* These are not surmises. They are

<p>facts. Some official documents, giving the

<p>constitution and doings of this Foreign So-

<p>New York Observer, and have been copied ex-

<p>This society having ostensibly a religions ob-

</p>
<p>is these United States. It meets and forms its

</p>
<p>to find great care to avoid any unnecessary
</p>
<p>exposure of covert political designs. The evi-
</p>
<p>dence therefore of. a concerted political attack
</p>
<p>upon our institutions, which I conceive to lurk
</p>
<p>under the sudden and extraordinary zeal of
</p>
<p>Austria for the religions welfare of the United
</p>
<p>States, will not depend altogether on the infor-
</p>
<p>mation derived from these documents. Such
</p>
<p>an attack is what might be expected from the
</p>
<p>present political attitude of the European na-
</p>
<p>tions, in regard to the principles of despotism
</p>
<p>and liberty, from the powerful and unavoida-
</p>
<p>ble effect which our institutions exert in favour
</p>
<p>of the popular principle ; and also from the

<p>known political character of Austria.
</p>
<p>Who, and what is Austria, the government
</p>
<p>that is so benevolently concerned for our reli-
</p>
<p>gious welfare ? Austria is one of that Holy
</p>
<p>Alliance of despotic governments, one of the
</p>
<p>'union of Christian princes," leagued against
</p>
<p>the liberties of the people of Europe. Austria
</p>
<p>is one of the partitioners of Poland; the en-
</p>
<p>slaver and despot of Italy. Her government
</p>
<p>is the most thorough military despotism in the
</p>
<p>world. She is the declared and consistent en-
</p>
<p>emy of civil and religious liberty, of the free-
</p>
<p>dom of the press ; in short, of every great

<p>principle in those free institutions which it is

</p>
<p>bitter enemy of Protestantism. The famous
</p>
<p>thirty years' war, marked by every kind of
</p>
<p>brutal excess, was waged to extirpate tliose
</p>
<p>very principles of civil and relictions liberty
</p>
<p>which lie at the foundation of our government;
</p>
<p>and had Austria then triumphed, this republic
</p>
<p>wonld never have been founded.
</p>
<p>And what are the people of Austria ? They
</p>
<p>are slaves, slaves iii body and mind, vv^hipped
</p>
<p>and disciplined by priests to have no opinions
</p>
<p>of their own, and taught to consider their Em-
</p>
<p>peror their God. They are the jest and by-
</p>
<p>word of the Northern Germans, who never

<p>slaves unworthy the name of Germans ; as

<p>plans for stifling liberty in Europe and through-

<p>his Travels in Germany, "by his wonderful

<p>talent in exciting fear, has thus far controlled
</p>
<p>the cabinets of Europe, and has exerted an in-

<p>fluence over the destinies of nations, little, if

<p>any inferior to that of Napoleon." He persuaded
</p>
<p>the Emperor of Austria and King of Prussia
</p>
<p>?iot to fulfil the promise they so solemnly made
</p>
<p>to their German subjects, of giving them free

</p>
<p>against his wishes, to send 100,000 men thither

<p>under the Diike dMngouleme to restore 'public
</p>
<p>order ! When Sicily. Naples, and Genoa, in
</p>
<p>1820-1, threw off the galling yoke of slavery,
</p>
<p>Metternich sent his 30,000 Austrian bayonets
</p>
<p>into Italy, and re-established despotism. And
</p>
<p>when in 1831, (as the writer can testify from
</p>
<p>personal observation.) goaded to desperation by
</p>
<p>the extortion, and tyranny, and bad faith of
</p>
<p>the Papal government, the Italian patriots made
</p>
<p>a noble and successful effort to remedy their
</p>
<p>political evils by a revolution firm, yet tempe-
</p>
<p>rate, founded in the most tolerant principles,
</p>
<p>marl^ed by no excess, and hailed by the lega-
</p>
<p>tions with universal joy, asfain did this arch-
</p>
<p>enemy of human happiness let loose his myrmi-
</p>
<p>dons, overwhelming the cities, dragging the pa-
</p>
<p>triots, Italy's first citizens, to the scaffold, or incar-
</p>
<p>cerating them in the dungeons of Venice, filling
</p>
<p>whole provinces with mourning, and bringing
</p>
<p>back upon the wretchedly oppressed populatioa
</p>
<p>the midnight darkness which the dawn of liber-
</p>
<p>ty had begun to dispel. "Prince Metternich," v"

<p>48 CATHOLIC MISSIONS THE INSTRUMENT.
</p>
<p>Every intelligent man who has resided even
</p>
<p>for a short time in the Austrian dominions,
</p>
<p>mnst have seen enough of the craft, both of the
</p>
<p>government and the priests, to make him sus-
</p>
<p>picious of ail their doings, and most so, when
</p>
<p>they are most lavish of their professions of
</p>
<p>kindness and benevolence. " Timco Danaos
</p>
<p>et dona ferentes."
</p>
<p>But let us see what Austria avows as her de-
</p>
<p>sign in the formation of the Leopold Founda-
</p>
<p>tion.* The first great object is " to promote the
</p>
<p>greater activity of Catholic missions in Amer-
</p>
<p>ica." She may be, and doubtless is, perfectly
</p>
<p>* Some may be inclined to ask, is not this society a pri-
</p>
<p>vate associaiion, merely chartered by the government, not
</p>
<p>difiering materially from the religious societies in our own
</p>
<p>country 7 I answer that, were the Leopold Foundation an
</p>
<p>association of private individuals, (which it is not,j yet
</p>
<p>got up in the Austrian dominions, it would still be a gov-
</p>
<p>ernment ajfair. For we must not confound the practices
</p>
<p>of two governments, so totally opposite in the administra-
</p>
<p>tion of all their affairs as the Austrian and our own.
</p>
<p>From the happy separation of church and state in our own
</p>
<p>country, religious societies, of whatever character, have
</p>
<p>no coniiexion with the government. They move in a sep-
</p>
<p>arate sphere of action, yet in pefect harmony with it. But
</p>
<p>in Austria, no plan, no society of any kind is private ; the
</p>
<p>government interferes in every thing, is all in all. Even
</p>
<p>the persecuted Maroncelli, confined in the dungeons of
</p>
<p>Spielberg for the crime of loving the'political principles of
</p>
<p>this country, must wait a week, at the risk of his life, for
</p>
<p>a gracious permission from the Paternal government to
</p>
<p>have his leg amputated. Yes, a private matter like this is

<p>They are not in discussion. If any wish to

<p>resolve their doubts in the religious contro-

<p>versy, the acute pens of^ the polemic writers of
</p>
<p>the day \|^ill furnish them abundant means of

</p>
<p>which wnll be found to as^ree or disac-ree with
</p>
<p>the principles of any given form of civil gov-

</p>
<p>consider some of the antagonist principles of

<p>the government of Austria and of the United

<p>States, and compare them with the principles

<p>of government of the Catholic and Protestant

<p>sects. By this method we shall be able to

<p>judge of their bearing on the pernianency of

<p>principle of government, Xhdii principle which,

<p>according to its agreement with one or the

<p>sovereign pmver  ' We, the People, do or-
</p>
<p>dain, establish, grant,^^ &c. In one principle
</p>
<p>is recognised the necessity of the servitude of
</p>
<p>the people, the absokite dependance of the sub-
</p>
<p>ject, unqiiahfied submission to the commands
</p>
<p>of the rulers without question or examination.
</p>
<p>The Rider is Master, the People are Slaves.
</p>
<p>in the other is recognised the supremacy of
</p>
<p>the jjeople, the equality of rights and powers of
</p>
<p>the citizen, submission alone to laws emanating
</p>
<p>from themselves ; the Ruler is a public serv-

<p>ant, receiving wages from the people to perform
</p>
<p>services agreeable to their pleasure ; amenable
</p>
<p>in all things to thsm, and holding office at their

<p>will. The Rider is Servant, the People are

<p>the difference in these antagonist doctrines,

<p>leading, as is perceived, to diametrically oppo-

<p>order to proceed at once to the inquiry, Which

<p>position does tlie Cathohc sect and the Protest-

<p>the Vatican, scarce four months old, a docu-
</p>
<p>ment in which the Pope interferes directly in
</p>
<p>the political affairs of Portugal against Don
</p>
<p>Pedro. "How can there be unity in the
</p>
<p>body," says the Pope, " when the members are
</p>
<p>not united to the head, and do not obey it?
</p>
<p>And how can this union and obedience be
</p>
<p>maintained in a country where they drive from
</p>
<p>their sees the bishops, legitimately instituted by
</p>
<p>Hi?ii to whom it appertains to assign pastors

<p>to all the vacant churches, because the divine

<p>Catholic doctrine. The following questions

<p>and answers are propounded :

<p>of Christianity? Ans. As proceeding imme-

</p>
<p>parts called nations ; the government of which
</p>
<p>is intrusted to a Prince, King, or Emperor, or
</p>
<p>in other words, to a supreme ruler ; we see,
</p>
<p>then, that as man exists in conformity to the
</p>
<p>will of God, society emanates from the same
</p>
<p>divine will, and more especially the supreme
</p>
<p>power and authority of our lord and master,
</p>
<p>the Czar.

<p>" Q,uest. 3. What duties does religion teach
</p>
<p>us, the humble subjects f his Majesty the Em-
</p>
<p>ueror of Russia, to practise towards him ? Ans.

<p>sist, and how should it be manifested ? Ans.

<p>By the most unqualified reverence in words,

<p>gestures, demeanor, thoughts, and actions.

<p>owe him? Ans. An entire, passive, and un-

<p>bounded obedience in every point of view.

<p>owe to the Emperor ? Ans. In executing his

<p>commands most rigorously, without examina-

<p>tion, in performing the duties he requires from
</p>
<p>us, and in dohig every thing willingly without
</p>
<p>murmuring.

<p>Emperor obligatory on us? Ans. Absolutely

</p>
<p>to execute the divine commands ; and conse-
</p>
<p>quently, disobedience to the Emperor is identi-
</p>
<p>fied with disobedience to God himself; that
</p>
<p>God will reward us in the world to come for
</p>
<p>the worship and obedience we render the Em-
</p>
<p>peror, and punish us severely to all eternity,
</p>
<p>should we disobey and neglect to worship him.
</p>
<p>Moreover, God commands us to love and obey,
</p>
<p>from the inmost recesses of the heart, every
</p>
<p>authority, and particularly the Emperor^ not

<p>from worldly considerations, but from appre-
</p>
<p>hension of the final judgment. * *

<p>doctrine? Ans. The example of Jesus Christ

<p>himself, who lived and died in allegiance to
</p>
<p>the Emperor of Rome, and ^respectfully sub-
</p>
<p>mitted to the judgment which condemned him
</p>
<p>to death. We have, moreover, the example of

<p>the Apostles, who both loved and respected

<p>them ; they suffered meekly in dungeons, con-
</p>
<p>formably to the will of Emperors, and did not
</p>
<p>revolt like malefactors and traitors. We must,
</p>
<p>therefore, in imitation of these examples, sufter
</p>
<p>and be silent."
</p>
<p>This is the slavish doctrine taught to the
</p>
<p>Catholics of Poland. The people, instead of
</p>
<p>having power or rights, are, according to this
</p>
<p>catechism, mere passive slaves, born for their
</p>
<p>masters ; tauo;ht, by a perversion of the threat-

<p>try that holds such abject sentiments, or whose

<p>creed inculcates such barefaced idolatry of a

<p>human being ? Protestantism, on the contrary,
</p>
<p>at its birth, while yet bound with many of the
</p>
<p>sliackles of Popery, attacked, in its earliest
</p>
<p>lispings of freedom, this very doctrine of divine
</p>
<p>right. It was Luther, and by a singular coin-
</p>
<p>cidence of day too, on the fourth of July ^ who
</p>
<p>first, in a public disputation at Leipsic with his

<p>Popish aiitao;onist. called in question the divine

<p>right of the Pope.
</p>
<p>Let us now examine in contrast other politi-
</p>
<p>cal rights, liherty of conscience^ liberty of opin-
</p>
<p>ion^ and liberty of the press. Austria and the
</p>
<p>United States diifer on these points as widely
</p>
<p>as on the fundamental question. Austria not
</p>
<p>only has the press in her own territory under
</p>
<p>censorship, but intermeddles to control the press
</p>
<p>in the neighboring states on the principle of
</p>
<p>self-preservation. " In Saxony," says Dwight,
</p>
<p>" the press is fettered by Austria and Prussia,
</p>
<p>who alleged this reason, ' that all the works
</p>
<p>published in Saxony, which are not on the
</p>
<p>proscribed list, are freely admitted into cur
</p>
<p>dominions. For our happiness, therefore, and
</p>
<p>the stability of our thrones, it is necessary
</p>
<p>that the press should be, fettered ! P " As to

</p>
<p>It is our glory, on the contrary, that all these
</p>
<p>rights are secured to us by our institutions,
</p>
<p>and freely enjoyed, not only without the least
</p>
<p>danger to the peace of the state, but from the
</p>
<p>very genius of our government, they are es-
</p>
<p>teemed amonsr its most precious sateguards.
</p>
<p>What are the Catholic tenets on these points ?
</p>
<p>Shall 1 go back some three or four hundred
</p>
<p>years, and quote the pontifical law. which says,
</p>
<p>[Art. 9,1 " Tiie Pope has the power to inter-
</p>

<p>tered ? No! it is unnecessary to go farther
</p>
<p>than the present day. The reigning pontiff,
</p>
<p>Gregory XVI., shall again answer the ques-
</p>
<p>tion. He has most opportunely furnished us
</p>
<p>with the present sentiments of the Catholic
</p>
<p>church on these very points. In his encycli-
</p>
<p>cal letter, dated Sept. 183"2, the Pope, lament-
</p>
<p>ing the disorders and infidelity of the times,
</p>

<p>liberty of opinion wliich is everywhere at-
</p>
<p>tempting the overthrow of rehgious and civil
</p>
<p>institutions, and which the unbhishing impu-
</p>
<p>dence of some has held forth as an advantage
</p>
<p>to rehgion. Hence thatpest^ of all others most

<p>opinion^ hcentiousness of speech, and a hist of
</p>
<p>novelty, which, according to the experience of
</p>
<p>all ages, portend the downfall of the mostpower-
</p>
<p>ful and flourishing empires."
</p>
<p>" Hither tends that worst and never suflicient-
</p>
<p>ly to be execrated and detested liberty op

<p>THE PRESS, for the diffusion of all manner of
</p>
<p>writings, which some so loudly contend for,
</p>
<p>and so actively promote."
</p>
<p>He complains, too, of the dissemination of un-
</p>
<p>licensed books.
</p>
<p>" No means must be here omitted, says Cle-
</p>
<p>ment XIII., our predecessor of happy memory,
</p>
<p>in the Encyclical Letter on the proscription of
</p>
<p>bad books  710 means must be here omitted^
</p>
<p>as the extremity of the case calls for all our exer-

<p>tions, to exterminate the fatal pest which
</p>
<p>spreads through so many w^orks, nor can the
</p>
<p>materials of error be otherwise destroyed than
</p>
<p>by the flarjies, which consume the depraved
</p>
<p>elements of the evil."
</p>
<p>Now all this is explicit enough, here is no
</p>
<p>ambiguity. We see clearly, from infallible
</p>
<p>authority, that the Catholic of the present day,
</p>
<p>wherever he may be, if he is true to the princi-
</p>
<p>ples of his sect, cannot consistently tolerate

<p>Popery is the cause of despotism?

<p>ved by the people of the United States. No
</p>
<p>foreio-ii body has any such union with any sect
</p>
<p>of Protestants in the United States, as even to
</p>
<p>advise, much less to control any of its measures.
</p>
<p>Our Episcopalians appoint their own bishops
</p>
<p>without consulting the church of Enn^land ;
</p>
<p>our Presbyterians are entirely independent of
</p>
<p>the church of Scodand ; and our Wesleyan
</p>
<p>Methodists have no ecclesiastical connexion
</p>
<p>with the disciples of Wesley in the old world.
</p>
<p>But how is it in these respects with the Catho-
</p>
<p>lics? The right of appointing to all ecclesias-
</p>
<p>tical offices in this country, as everywhere
</p>
<p>v^else, is in the Pope, (now a mere creature of
</p>
<p>Austria.) Fie claims the power, as we have
</p>
<p>seen, by divine ri^ht. All the bishops, and all
</p>
<p>the ecclesiastics down to the most insignificant
</p>
<p>oliicer in the church, are, from the genius of
</p>
<p>the system, entirely under his control. And lie,
</p>
<p>of course, will appoint none to office but those
</p>
<p>who will favor the views of Austria. He will
</p>
<p>require all whom he appoints, to support the
</p>
<p>agents whom Austria is sending to this country
</p>
<p>for the accomplishment of her own purposes. *
</p>
<p>And who are these agents ? Tlieij are^ for
</p>
<p>the most part, Jesuits, an ecclesiastical order
</p>
<p>proverbial throuo;h the world for cunning, du-
</p>
<p>plicity, and total want of moral principle ; an
</p>
<p>order so skilled in all the arts of deception, that
</p>
<p>even in Catholic countries, in Italy itself, it
</p>
<p>became intolerable, and the people required its
</p>
<p>suppression. They are Jesuits in the pay and

<p>in this, we shall then learn, when too late to

<p>remedy the evil, that Popery abandons none of

<p>its divine rights. The leaders of this sect are

<p>disciplined and organized, and have their ad-

<p>What I liave advanced in my previous

</p>
<p>there is ^ooA. reason for heUeving that the des-

<p>pots of Europe are attempting, by the spread
</p>
<p>of Popery in this country, to subvert its free
</p>
<p>institutions ; yet many may think tliat there are

<p>so many connteracting canses in the constitu-

<p>with the cast-off chains of the bigotry and

<p>on the destruction of all toleration. Yes, the
</p>
<p>Catholic is permitted to work in the light of
</p>
<p>Protestant toleration, to mature his plans, and
</p>
<p>to execute his designs to extinguish that light,
</p>
<p>and destroy the hands that hold it. It is no
</p>
<p>refutation of the charge of intolerance here
</p>
<p>made against Catholics as a sect, to show that
</p>
<p>small bodies of them under peculiar circum-
</p>
<p>stances, have been tolerant, or that in this
</p>
<p>country, where they have always been a small
</p>
<p>minority, they make high professions of ardent
</p>
<p>love for the republican, tolerant institutions of
</p>
<p>our government. No one can be deceived by
</p>
<p>evidence so partial and circumscribed, while
</p>
<p>the blood of the persecuted for opinions' sake
</p>
<p>stains with the deepest tinge every page of the
</p>
<p>history of that church, aye, even while it is
</p>
<p>still wet upon the dungeon floors of Italy;

<p>while the intolerant and anti-republican prin-
</p>
<p>ciples of Popery are now weekly thundered
</p>
<p>from the Vatican, and echoed in our ears by
</p>
<p>almost every arrival from Europe.*
</p>
<p>Let me not be charged with accusing the
</p>
<p>Catholics of the United States with intoler-
</p>
<p>ance. They are too small a body as yet fully
</p>
<p>to act out their principles, and their present
</p>
<p>conduct does not affect the general question in
</p>
<p>any way, unless it may be to prove that they
</p>
<p>are not genuine and consistent Catholics. The

<p>conduct of a small insulated body, under the

<p>collectively, in having no common bond of

<p>taken, while the unnatural estrangement lasts.

<p>Catholics have boasted that they can 7^/?/ off

<p>troversies that divide the contending parties,
</p>
<p>the pliable conscience of the Jesuit enables

<p>him to throw the weight of his influence on
</p>
<p>either side, as his interest may be ; the com-
</p>
<p>mand of his superiors, and the alleged good of
</p>
<p>the churchy (that is, the power of the priest-
</p>
<p>hood,) being paramount to all other considera-

<p>tions.
</p>
<p>This pliability of conscience, so advanta-

<p>of them are too ignorant to act at all for Iheni-
</p>
<p>selves, and expect to be gaided wholly by
</p>
<p>others. These others are of course their priests.
</p>
<p>Priests have ruled them at home by divine
</p>
<p>right ; their ignorant minds cannot ordinarily
</p>
<p>be emancipated from their habitual subjection,
</p>
<p>they will not learn nor appreciate their exemp-
</p>
<p>tion from any such usurpation of priestly pow-
</p>
<p>er in this country, and they are implicitly at
</p>
<p>the beck of their spiritual guides. They live
</p>
<p>surrounded by freedom, yet liberty of con-
</p>
<p>'science, right of private judgment, whether in
</p>
<p>religion or politics, are as effectually excluded
</p>
<p>(by the priests, as if the code of Austria already
</p>
<p>\ruled the land. They form a body of men
</p>
<p>whose habits oi action (for 1 cannot say thought)
</p>
<p>are opposed to the principles of our free insti-
</p>
<p>tutions, for, as they are not accessible to the rea-
</p>
<p>sonings of the press, they cannot and do not
</p>
<p>think for themselves.
</p>
<p> Every unlettered Catholic emigrant, there-
</p>
<p>fore, that comes into the country, is adding to
</p>
<p>a mass of ignorance which it will be difficult
</p>
<p>to reach by any liberal instruction ; and how-
</p>
<p>ever honest, (and I have no doubt most of them

<p>are so,) yet, from the nature of things, they are

<p>The press, with its arguments for or against
</p>
<p>any political measure, can have no effect on
</p>
<p>minds tauo^ht only to think as the priest thinks,
</p>
<p>and to do what the priest commands. Here
</p>
<p>is a large body of ignorant men brought into
</p>
<p>our community, who are unapproachable by
</p>
<p>any of tlie ordinary means of enlightening the
</p>
<p>people  a body of men who servilely obey a

<p>the country by none of tlie usual ties, owing

<p>allegiance and service to a foreign government ;

<p>the manner in which they discharge the du-

<p>which is, doubtless for the present, to confine

<p>themselves simply and wholly to increasing

<p>HOW PRIESTS /.RE PROPITIATED. 73
</p>
<p>these leaders must esteem it very important
</p>
<p>that the priests be propitiated. And how is a
</p>
<p>Cathohc priest to be propitiated ? How, but
</p>
<p>by stipulating for that which will increase his
</p>
<p>power, or the power of the church, for be it al-
</p>
<p>ways borne in mind that they are identical.
</p>
<p>The Roman church is the body of priests and
</p>
<p>-prelates ; the laity have only to obey and to
</p>
<p>pay^ not to exercise antliority. The priest
</p>
<p>must be favored in his plans of destroying Pro-
</p>
<p>testantism, and building up Popery. He must
</p>
<p>have money from the public treasury to en-
</p>
<p>dow Catholic institutions ; he must be allowed
</p>
<p>to have charters for these institutions which
</p>
<p>will confer extraordinary powers upon their
</p>
<p>Jesuit trustees ;* he must be permitted quietly
</p>
<p>to break down the Protestant Sabbath, by en-
</p>
<p>couraging Catholics to buy and sell on that
</p>
<p>day as on other days ; in one Avord, he must
</p>
<p>have ail the powers and privileges which the
</p>
<p>law, or the officers appointed to administer the
</p>
<p>law, can conveniently bestow upon him. The
</p>
<p>demagogue, or the party who will promise to
</p>
<p>do most for tiie accomplishment of these ob-
</p>
<p>jects, will secure all the votes adiich he con-
</p>
<p>trols. Surely there is grea. danger to our
</p>
<p>present institutions from this source, and men
</p>
<p>as skilful as are the Jesuits, we may be sure
</p>
<p>will not fail to use the power thus thrown into
</p>
<p>their hands to work great mischief to the re-

</p>
<p>portance of some measures of repelling this in-
</p>
<p>sidious invasion of the country.
</p>
<p>The Bishop of Bakimore, writing to the
</p>
<p>Austrian Society, laments the wretched state of
</p>
<p>the Catholic religion in Virginia, and as a proof
</p>
<p>of the difficulty it has to contend with, (a proof
</p>
<p>donhtless shocking to the pious docility of his
</p>
<p>Austrian readers.) he says :
</p>
<p>" I sent to Kiciimond a zealous missionary,
</p>
<p>a native of America. He travelled through the
</p>
<p>whole of Virginia. The Protestants flocked on
</p>
<p>all sides to hear him; they offered hiiu their
</p>
<p>churches, court-houses, and other public build-
</p>
<p>ings, to preach in  which, however, is not at all
</p>
<p>surprising, for the people are divided into nu-
</p>
<p>merous sects, and know not what faith to em-
</p>
<p>brace. In consequence of being spoiled by bad
</p>
<p>instruction, thei/ loill judge every thing them-
</p>
<p>selves ; they therefore hear eagerly every new
</p>
<p>comer," &.c.
</p>
<p>The Bishop, if he had the power, would of
</p>
<p>course change this " bad instruction^'^ for bet-
</p>
<p>ter, and, as in Catholic countries, would relieve
</p>
<p>them from the trouble oi judging for tJieni-
</p>
<p>selves. Thus the liberti/ 0/ private judgment
</p>
<p>and freedom of opinion, guarantied by our
</p>
<p>institutions, are avowedly an obstacle to the
</p>
<p>success of the Catholics. Is it not natural that
</p>
<p>Catholics should desire to remove this obstacle

<p>* A Catholic journal of this city (the Register and Dia-
</p>
<p>PROM THE LETTERS OF THE JESUITS. 83
</p>
<p>My Lord Bishop Flaget, of Bardstown, Ken-
</p>
<p>twclvy, in a letter to his patrons abroad, has this
</p>
<p>plain hint at an ulterior political design^ and
</p>
<p>that no less than the entire subversion of our
</p>
<p>republican government. Speakins; of the diffi-
</p>
<p>culties and discouragements the Catholic mis-
</p>
<p>sionaries have to contend with in converting the
</p>
<p>Indians, the last difficulty in the way he says,
</p>
<p>is "their continual traffic among the whites,
</p>
<p>WHICH CANNOT BE HINDERED AS LONG AS THF:
</p>
<p>REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT SHALL SUBSIST!"
</p>
<p>What is this but saying that a republican
</p>
<p>government is unfavorable in its nature to the
</p>
<p>restrictions we deem necessary to the extension
</p>
<p>of the Catholic religion ; when the time shall
</p>
<p>come that the present government shall be sub-
</p>
<p>verted, which we are looking forward to, or
</p>
<p>hope for, we can then hinder this traffic?
</p>
<p>Mr. Baraga, the German missionary in Michi-
</p>
<p>gan, seems impressed with the same conviction
</p>
<p>of the unhappy influences of a free government
</p>
<p>ry) was put into my hands as I had completed this last
</p>
<p>paragraph. Il contains the same sentiment, so illustrati\'-e
</p>
<p>of the natural abhorrence of Catholics to the exercise of
</p>
<p>private judgment, that I cannot forbear quotingit.
</p>
<p>" We seriously advise Catholic parents to be very cau-
</p>
<p>tious in the choice of school-books for their children.
</p>
<p>There is more danger to be apprehended in this quarter
</p>
<p>than could be conceived. Parents, we are aware, have
</p>
<p>not always the time or patience to examine these matters :
</p>
<p>but if they trust iinplicUlif to us, ice shall, xoith God's help, do
</p>
<p>il for them. Legimus lie legantur.'' We read, that they

<p>upon his attempts to make converts to the
</p>
<p>church of Rome. In giving an account of the
</p>
<p>refusal of some persons to have their children
</p>
<p>baptized, he lays the fault on this " too free
</p>
<p>{allzii,frci.en) government." In a more de-
</p>
<p>spotic government, in Italy or Austria, he would
</p>
<p>have been able to put in force compulsory bap-
</p>
<p>tism on these children.*
</p>
<p>These few extracts are quite sufficient to
</p>
<p>show how our form of government, which gives
</p>
<p>to the Catholics all the freedom and facihties
</p>
<p>that all other sects enjoy, does from its very
</p>
<p>nature embarrass their despotic plans. Accus-
</p>
<p>tomed to dictate at home, how annoying it is to
</p>
<p>these Austrian ecclesiastics to be obliged to
</p>
<p>put off their authority ; to yield their divine
</p>
<p>right of judofing for others ; to be compelled to
</p>
<p>get at men through their reason and conscience,
</p>
<p>instead of the more summary way of compul-
</p>
<p>sion ! The disposition to use force, if they
</p>
<p>could, shows itself in spite of all their caution.
</p>
<p>The inclination is there. It is reined in by
</p>
<p>circumstances. They want only strength to
</p>
<p>act out the inherent despotism of Popery.
</p>
<p>But let me show what are some of the politi-
</p>
<p>cal partialities which these foreign emissaries
</p>
<p>discover in their letters and statements to their
</p>
<p>Austrian supporters. They acknowledge their
</p>
<p>unsuspicious reception by the people of the
</p>
<p>United States ; they acknowledge that Protest-
</p>
<p>ants in all parts of the country have even
</p>
<p>aided them with money to build their chap-
</p>
<p>els, and colleges, and nunneries, and treat-

</p>
<p>fide in their honor and in their promises that
</p>
<p>they would use no attempts to proselyte them !
</p>
<p>And with all this, does it not once occur to
</p>
<p>these gentlemen, that this liberality, and gene-
</p>
<p>rosity, and openness of character are the fruits of
</p>
<p>Protestant republicanism? Mi^ht we not ex-
</p>
<p>pect at least that Popery, were it republican in
</p>
<p>its nature, would find something in all tliis
</p>
<p>that would excite admiration, and call forth
</p>
<p>some praise of a system so contrasted to that
</p>
<p>of any other government ; some acknowledof-
</p>
<p>ments to the government of the country that
</p>
<p>protects it, and allows its enemies the unpar-
</p>
<p>alleled liberty even to plot the downfall of the
</p>
<p>state 7 But no, the government of the United
</p>
<p>States is not once mentioned in praise. The
</p>
<p>very principle of the g"overnment, throuo-h
</p>
<p>v/hich they are tolerated, is thus slightingly no-
</p>
<p>ticed : ' The government of the United States
</p>
<p>has thought fit to adopt a complete indiffer-
</p>
<p>ence towards all religions.'** They can re-
</p>
<p>cognise no nobler principle than indifference.
</p>
<p>Again, of the people of our country they
</p>
<p>thus write : ''We entreat all European Chris-
</p>
<p>tians to unite in prayer to God for the conver-
</p>
<p>sion of these unhappy heathen and obstinate

<p>90 COMPOSITION OF MOBS.
</p>
<p>To any such inquirers, let me say there
</p>
<p>are many ways in which a body organized
</p>
<p>as are the Cathohcs. and moving in concert,
</p>
<p>mi2:ht disturb (to use the mildest term) the
</p>
<p>S^ood order of the republic, and thus compel
</p>
<p>us to present to observing Europe the spectacle
</p>
<p>of repubhcan anarchy. Who is not aware
</p>
<p>that a great portion of that stuff which compo-
</p>
<p>ses a mob, ripe for riot or excess of any kind,
</p>
<p>and of which we have every week or two a
</p>
<p>fresh example in some part of the country, is a
</p>
<p>Catiiohc* population ? And what makes it tur-
</p>
<p>bulent I Ignorance  an io"norance which it is
</p>
<p>for the interest of its leaders not to enlighten ;
</p>
<p>for, enlighten a man, and he will think for him-
</p>
<p>self, and have some self-respect; he will un-
</p>
<p>derstand the laws, and know his interest in
</p>
<p>obeying tliem. Keep him in ignorance, and.
</p>
<p>he is the slave of the man who will tlatter his
</p>
<p>passions and appetites, or awe him by super-
</p>
<p>stitious fears. Against the outbreakings of such
</p>
<p>men, society, as it is constituted on our free
</p>
<p>system, can protect itself only in one of two
</p>
<p>ways : it must either bring these men under
</p>
<p>the influence and control of a sound republican
</p>
<p>and religious education, or it must call in the
</p>
<p>aid of tJte prU-sfs who govern them, and who
</p>
<p>may permU and direct, or restrain their turbu-
</p>
<p>lence, in accordance with what they may judge
</p>
<p>at any particular time to be the interest of the

<p>straint by a police of priests, by substituting
</p>
<p>the ecclesiastical for the civil power, the priest-
</p>
<p>led mobs of Portugal and Spain, and South

<p>able to restore order among' them and obe-

<p>in Poland in the late revohition, and, through

<p>the priests, command submission to the tyran-

<p>ny of the Czar ? At the moment I am writing-,

<p>are not monks and priests leaders in the held

<p>of battle in Spain; in Portugal? Is not the

<p>Pope encouraging the troops of Don Miguel,

<p>and exciting priests and people to arms in a

<p>civil contest? Has Popery abandoned its ever-

<p>where it obtains foothold I*
</p>
<p>Will it be said, that however officious in the
</p>
<p>old countries, yet here, by some strange meta-
</p>
<p>morphosis. Popery ha$ changed its character,
</p>
<p>and is modified by our institutions ; that here
</p>
<p>it is surely religious, seeking only the religious
</p>
<p>welfare of the people  that it does not meddle

<p>majority of the people being Catholics. As

<p>test between the bishop and his Protestant rival

<p>was more and more close, until at length, by

<p>the increase of Protestant emigration, the latter

<p>triumphed. The bishop, in order to detect any

<p>orders, or what penance was inflicted for diso-
</p>
<p>bedience, I did not learn. The fact of such a
</p>
<p>truly Jesuitical mode of espionage I have from
</p>
<p>a gentleman resident at that time in Detroit.
</p>
<p>Is not a fact like this of some importance? 
</p>
<p>Does it not show that Popery, with all its spe-
</p>
<p>ciousness, is the same here as elsewhere ? It
</p>
<p>manifests, when it has the opportunity, its gen-
</p>
<p>uine disposition to use spiritual power for the
</p>
<p>promotion of its ie??iporal ambition. It uses its
</p>
<p>ecclesiastical weapons to control an election.
</p>
<p>In Charleston, S. C. the Roman Catholic
</p>
<p>Bishop, England, is said to have boasted of the
</p>
<p>number of votes that he could control at an
</p>
<p>election. I have been informed, on authority
</p>
<p>which cannot be doubted, that in New- York, a
</p>
<p>priest, in a late election for city officers, stopped
</p>
<p>his congregation after mass on Sunday and
</p>
<p>urged the electors not to vote for a particular
</p>
<p>candidate, on the ground of his being an anti-
</p>
<p>Catholic ; the result was the election of the
</p>
<p>Catholic candidate.
</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to multiply facts of this nature,
</p>
<p>nor will it be objected that these instances are
</p>
<p>unworthy of notice, because of their local or
</p>
<p>circums,cribed character. Surely American
</p>
<p>Protestants, freemen, have discernment enough
</p>
<p>to discover beneath them the cloven foot of this
</p>
<p>subtle foreign heresy, and will not wait for a
</p>
<p>more extensive, disastrous, and overwhelming

<p>the sacred naiiio of religion. They will be

<p>deeply impressed with tfie truth, that Popery is

<p>a jmUtical as well as a religious system ; that
</p>
<p>ill this respect it ditfers totally from all other
</p>
<p>sects, from all other forms of religion in the
</p>
<p>country. Popery imhodies in itself the clo-
</p>
<p>sest UNION OF Church AND State. Observe
</p>
<p>it at the fountain-head. In the Roman States
</p>
<p>the civil and ecclesiastical offices are blended
</p>
<p>together in the same individual. The Pojje is
</p>
<p>the Kiii^. A Cardinal is Secretary of State.
</p>
<p>The Consistory of Cardinals is the Cabitiel
</p>
<p>Coimcil, the Ministry^ and they are Viceroys
</p>
<p>in the provinces. The Archbishops are Am-
</p>
<p>bassadors to foreign courts. The Bishops are
</p>
<p>Judges and Magistrates ; and the road to
</p>
<p>preferment to most, if not all the great offices of
</p>
<p>state, is through the priesthood. In Rome, and
</p>
<p>the patrimony of St. Peter, the temporal and
</p>
<p>spiritual powers are so closely united in the
</p>
<p>same individual, that no attack ca-n be made on
</p>
<p>any temporal misrule without drawing down
</p>
<p>upon the assailants the vengeance of the s^pir-
</p>
<p>itual power exercised by the same individual.
</p>
<p>Is the Judge corrupt or oppressive, and do the
</p>
<p>people rise against him  the Judge retires into
</p>
<p>the Bishop^ and in his sacred retreat cries,
</p>
<p>" Touch not the Lord's annointed."
</p>
<p>Can we not discern the 'political character of
</p>
<p>Popery ? Shall the name of Religion^ artfully
</p>
<p>connected with it, still blind our eyes ? Let us

<p>Our institutions have ah'eady withstood ma-

<p>the war has now assumed a new shape. An

<p>effort is now making that is to try the moral

</p>
<p>cal contest on the land or on the water. The

<p>where will be the political institutions of the

<p>country? Fifty years would amply suffice to

<p>give the victory to the despotic principle, and

<p>realize the most sanguine wishes of the tyrants

<p>The first thing to be done to secure safety,

<p>is to open our eyes at once to the reality and the

<p>would be effectual, but this remedy is remote
</p>
<p>in its operation, and is most seriously retarded
</p>
<p>by the enormous increase of ignorance which
</p>
<p>is floodino; the country by foreign emigra-
</p>
<p>tion. While, therefore, the remote effects of
</p>
<p>our exertions are still provided for, the pressing
</p>
<p>exicjency of the case seems to require some
</p>
<p>more immediate eflbrts to prevent the further
</p>
<p>spread of the evil. The two-fold character of
</p>
<p>the enemy who is attacking us must be well
</p>
<p>considered. Popery is doubly opposed civ illi/
</p>
<p>and religionslf/ to all that is valuable in our
</p>
<p>free institutions. As a religions system, it is
</p>
<p>the avowed and common enemy of every other
</p>
<p>reli'jious sect in the land. The Episcopalian,
</p>
<p>the~Methodist, the Presbyterian, the Baptist,
</p>
<p>the Quaker, the Unitarian, the Jew, &c., &c.,
</p>
<p>are alike anathematized, are together obstinate
</p>
<p>heretics, in the creed of the Papist. He wages
</p>
<p>a}i indiscriminate, uncompromising, extermi-
</p>
<p>iiatin::^: v/ar with all.
</p>
<p>As^a political system, it is opposed to every
</p>
<p>political party in the country. Popery in its'
</p>
<p>very nature is opposed to the genius of our
</p>
<p>free system, notwithstandinof its affected, artful
</p>
<p>cppropriatiou (in our country only) of the

</p>
<p>We cannot be too often reminded of the
</p>
<p>double character of the enemy who has gained
</p>
<p>foothold upon our shores ; for althoguh Popery is
</p>
<p>a religious sect, and on this ground claims tol-
</p>
<p>eration side by side with other religious sects,
</p>
<p>yet Popery is also a political^ a despotic sys-
</p>
<p>tem, which we must repel as altogether incom-
</p>
<p>patilile with the existence of freedom. I repeat
</p>
<p>it, Popery is a political, a despotic system^
</p>
<p>which must be resisted by all true patriots.
</p>
<p>Is it asked, how can we separate the charac-
</p>
<p>ters thus combined in one individual? How
</p>
<p>can we repel the politics of a Papist without
</p>
<p>infringiug upon his religions right? I answer,
</p>
<p>that this is a difficulty lor Papists, not for Pro-
</p>
<p>testants to solve. If Papists have made their
</p>
<p>religion and despotism identical, that is not
</p>
<p>our fault. Our relimon, the Protestant reli-
</p>
<p>gion, and Liberty, are identical, and liberty
</p>
<p>keeps no terms with despotism. American

<p>party or interest could show a stronger claim
</p>
<p>upon the support of the whole nation. Its
</p>
<p>manifesto might run thus:
</p>
<p>Popery is a political system^ despotic in its
</p>
<p>organization, anti-democratic and anti-repub-
</p>
<p>lican^ and cannot therefore co-exist widi Amer-

<p>ican republicanism.
</p>
<p>* By classing these together at this moment, I do not in

<p>tend to commit myself as expressing approval or disap-
</p>
<p>proval of the right of each and all of these to organize, but

<p>merely to show that such organization does already exist

</p>
<p>questionable; but were their right unquestionably legal

</p>
<p>118 ITS MANIFESTO. /
</p>
<p>The ratio of increase of Popery is the exact
</p>
<p>ratio of decrease of civil liberty.
</p>
<p>The dominance of Popery in the United
</p>
<p>States is the certain destruction of our free in-
</p>
<p>stitutions.
</p>
<p>Popery, by its organization, is wholly under
</p>
<p>thecontrol of a foreign despotic Sovereign.
</p>
<p>Austria, one of the Holy Alliance of sove-
</p>
<p>reigns leasfued asrainst the liberties of the world,
</p>
<p>HAS THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF THE OPERA-
</p>
<p>TIONS OF Popery in this country.
</p>
<p>The accents of Austria in the United States
</p>
<p>are Jesuits and priests in the pay of tliat for-
</p>
<p>eign power, in active correspondence with their
</p>
<p>employers abroad, not bound by ties of any
</p>
<p>kind to our government or country, but, on the
</p>
<p>contrary, impelled by the strongest motives of
</p>
<p>ambition to serve the interests of a despotic
</p>
<p>foreiofu crovernment ; which ambition has al-
</p>
<p>ready, in one or more instances, been gratified,
</p>
<p>by promotion of these agents to higher office
</p>
<p>and wealth in Europe.
</p>
<p>Popery is a Union of Church and State,
</p>
<p>nor can Popery exist in this country in that
</p>
<p>plenitude of power which it claims as a di-
</p>
<p>vine riofht, and which, in the very nature of the
</p>
<p>system, it must continually strive to obtain,
</p>
<p>until such a union is consummated. Popery
</p>
<p>on this ground, therefore, is destructive to our
</p>
<p>religious as well as civil liberty.
</p>
<p>Popery is more dangerous and more formi-
</p>
<p>dable than any power in the United States, on
</p>
<p>the ground that, through its despotic organiza-

<p>tion, it can concentrate its efforts for any pur-

</p>
<p>pose with complete effect ; and that organiza-
</p>
<p>tion being wholly iinder/ore/^?i control, it can
</p>
<p>have no real sympathy with any thing Ameri-
</p>
<p>can. The fluids, and intellect, and intriguing
</p>
<p>experience of all Papal and despotic Europe^
</p>
<p>by means of agents at this moment organized
</p>
<p>throughont our land, can. at any time, be
</p>
<p>brought in aid of the enterprises of foreign
</p>
<p>powers in this country.
</p>
<p>These are the grounds upon which an ap-
</p>
<p>peal for support might be made to the patriot-
</p>
<p>ism, the love of liberty, the hatred of tyranny,
</p>
<p>temporal and spiritual, which belong in common
</p>
<p>to the wliole Protestant American family.
</p>
<p>But is this the plan of opposition to Popery
</p>
<p>that should be proposed, the plan which ought
</p>
<p>lobe adopted by the Protestant commnnity?
</p>
<p>No; distinctly and decidedly xo. Plausible as
</p>
<p>it may appear, and perfectly in accordance as
</p>
<p>it is with the practice of politicians, the Chris-
</p>
<p>tian community ought not, cannot adopt such
</p>
<p>an organization. There must not be a Chris-
</p>
<p>tian party. What ! sliall Christianity throw
</p>
<p>aside the keen moral and intellectual arms with
</p>
<p>which alone it has gained and secured every
</p>
<p>substantial victory since the commencement of
</p>
<p>its glorious career ; shall it exchange those arms
</p>
<p>of heavenly temper, " miorhty in pulling down
</p>
<p>strong holds," for the paltry, earthly (I might
</p>
<p>even say infernal) weapons of party strife ? Can
</p>
<p>Christianity stoop so low ? Can it bring itself
</p>
<p>down from contemplating its great work of rev-
</p>
<p>olutionizing the world, by brinoririg moral truth

<p>what many already see, the secret political

</p>
<p>depends upon a union of Church and State.
</p>
<p>No ; let American Christianity proclaim anew to

<p>all the world that it can never be wooed to any
</p>
<p>such unholy alliance. It will keep its garments
</p>
<p>unspotted from the crimes of the State. It will

<p>take none of the responsibihties of the political

<p>errors of the age, nor father any of the evils

<p>The propensity to resist by nn!a\vl"nl means the

<p>encroachment of an enemy, becanse that enemy
</p>
<p>uses snch means ao;ainst us, belonofs to human

<p>tation of being attacked, that we may lawfnlly

<p>their character; that we may "fiolit the devil

<p>tive vva-apon of "the Lord rebuke thee." '^l^he
</p>
<p>same spirit of Christianity which forbids us to

<p>return railinsf for railing, and persecution for

<p>persecution, forbids the nse of nnlawfnl or even
</p>
<p>of doubtful means of defence, merely because

<p>an enemy uses them to attack us. If Popery

<p>onr elections, if it interferes politically, and sells
</p>
<p>itself to this or that political demagogue or

<p>party, it should be remembered that this is noto-
</p>
<p>rionsly the true character of Popery. It is its
</p>
<p>nature. It cannot act otherwise. Intrio-ne is
</p>
<p>its appropriate business. Byt all this is foreign
</p>
<p>to Christianity. Christianity must not enter
</p>
<p>the political arena with Popery, nor be mailed
</p>
<p>in Popish armor. The weapons and strat-
</p>
<p>agems of Popery suit not with the sinjplicity

<p>and frankness of Christianity. Like David

<p>with the armor of Saul, it would sink beneath

<p>not be misunderstood as recommending no

<p>character of Popery makes it necessary to urge

<p>upon American citizens with equal force  the
</p>
<p>imperious duty of defending the distinctive

<p>principles of our civil government. It must

<p>be sufficiently manifest to every republican
</p>
<p>citizen that the civil polity of Popery is in di-

<p>rect opposition to all which he deems sacred in

<p>cannot, from its very nature, tolerate any of

<p>The War of Opinions.
</p>
<p>Every account from Europe attests the cor-
</p>
<p>rectness of the views here taken more than a
</p>
<p>year since, of the poUtical state of the civihzed
</p>
<p>world. This war of opinions, or of categories^
</p>
<p>as Lafayette termed it, is in truth commenced,
</p>
<p>and Americans, if they will but use common
</p>
<p>observation, cannot but feel that a neglect to no-
</p>
<p>tice and provide ao-ainst the consequences of
</p>
<p>that settled, systematic hostility to free institu-
</p>
<p>tions so strongly manifested by foreign powers,
</p>
<p>and which is daily assuming a more serious as-
</p>
<p>pect, will inevitably result in mischief to the
</p>
<p>country, will surely be attended with anarchy,
</p>
<p>if they wake not to the apprehension of the re-
</p>
<p>ality of this danger. Americans, you indeed
</p>
<p>sleep upon a mine. This is scarcely a figure
</p>
<p>of speech. You have excitable materials in
</p>
<p>the bosom of your society, which, skilfully put
</p>
<p>in action by artful demagogues, will subvert
</p>
<p>your present social system. You have a for-
</p>
<p>eigii interest too, daily, hourly increasing, ready
</p>
<p>to take advantage of every excitement, and
</p>
<p>which will shortly be beyond your control, or
</p>
<p>will be subdued only by blood. You have

<p>throwing the weis^ht of its influence on the side

<p>biofoted, or intolerant, or persecutinsf, if they

<p>should venture to lift up the consecrated cloak

<p>those powers who follow the standard of the

<p>says, " Ignorance, hypocrisy, and fanaticism are

</p>
<p>truth, must, now and forever be truth, lays
</p>
<p>opeu to our examination a wide field. All and
</p>
<p>each of these precepts, laws, and acts of Pope-
</p>
<p>ry, from the earliest ages to the present day,
</p>
<p>may be les'itimately quoted to show the politi-
</p>
<p>cal character of that sect. Innovation, repeal,
</p>
<p>reform, or progress can find no admittance into
</p>
<p>the Papal system, without destroying the funda-
</p>
<p>mental principle on which the whole system
</p>
<p>rests. " The whole of our faith," says Cardi-

</p>
<p>Protestantism, on the contrary, is founded on
</p>
<p>the ]5il)le ; the Bible is the rallying point of all
</p>
<p>Protestant religions sects. They all believe
</p>
<p>that God is its author. The religious ffiith ot
</p>
<p>each is bound to this one volume. But as the

<p>Bible prescribes no/orw of faith, or doctrine,

<p>Upon this freedom to choose accordinof to the
</p>
<p>dictates of reason and conscience, granted to
</p>
<p>man by his Maker, denied b}^ Roman Cathohcs
</p>
<p>and claimed by Protestants, is built the fabric
</p>
<p>of religions liberty. Difference of opinion be-
</p>
<p>ing allowed, controversy of course ensues, and
</p>
<p>converts are made, not by force of arms, but by
</p>
<p>force of truth, supported by appeals to reason
</p>
<p>and conscience. Zealous according" to the
</p>
<p>streng^th of his belief in the dogmas of his sect,
</p>
<p>the Protestant calls to his aid the treasures of
</p>
<p>science. He believes that the divine Author of
</p>
<p>truth in the Bible is also the author of truth in
</p>
<p>nature. He knows that as truth is one, He that
</p>
<p>created all that forms the vast field of scientific
</p>
<p>research cannot contradict truth in Scripture by
</p>
<p>truth in nature; the Protestant is therefore the
</p>
<p>consistent encourager of all learning, of all in-
</p>
<p>vestigation. Every discovery in science, he
</p>
<p>feels, brinsrs to relio-ious truth fresh treasures.
</p>
<p>Free inquiry and discussion, all intellectual ac-
</p>
<p>tivity, legitimately belongs to Protestantism. It
</p>
<p>is by thus opening wide the doors of knowledge,
</p>
<p>and letting in the light of natural science upon
</p>
<p>what it beheves to be the revealed truth of the
</p>
<p>Bible, that Protestantism has been able gradu-
</p>
<p>ally to bring out the principle of religions
</p>
<p>liberty^ and in its train the invaluable blessmg
</p>
<p>of civil liberty. At the commencement of the

<p>the times. The slavish prohibitions, the deep-
</p>
<p>rooted heathen rites, and the arbitrary dogmas
</p>
<p>of Popery, were then enforced by power, by
</p>
<p>ignorance and corrnption ; so that the struggle
</p>
<p>of free with despotic principles was attended,
</p>
<p>throngh many generations, with constant vicis-
</p>
<p>situde. No maxim or usage of Popish intoler-
</p>
<p>ance that for a long time clung or still clings
</p>
<p>to any of the Protes'tant systems of Europe, can
</p>
<p>be quoted against American Protestantism;
</p>
<p>consequently I am under no necessity of de-
</p>
<p>fending any despotic or intolerant practice
</p>
<p>which may be charged or proved upon foreign
</p>
<p>or ancient Protestantism ; while every act or
</p>
<p>practice, past or present, of Popish enactment

<p>Popery.

<p>What that duty was, may now easily be con-

<p>New-En 2^1 and, held in the jxreatest abhorrence;
</p>
<p>lor to Popery may be traced, thono-h remotely,
</p>
<p>yet clearly, the persecutions which drove the
</p>
<p>Pilgrim-fathers to this country. The history
</p>
<p>of those fathers, for ages previous, is but the
</p>
<p>history of hard-fought battles to wrest from
</p>
<p>Popish usurpation those invaluable rights, civil
</p>
<p>and religious, which they fled to this wilder-
</p>
<p>ness securely to enjoy. Ere Popery, then,
</p>
<p>could expect to gain foothold among the de-
</p>
<p>scendants of the persecuted Puritans, their
</p>
<p>almost innate abhorrence to Popery must be
</p>
<p>overcome. What plan could be better devised
</p>
<p>to accomplish the end, than to send the mild,
</p>
<p>conciliating, gentle Bishop to demonstrate, by
</p>
<p>his example and his teachingj that Popery was
</p>
<p>not that monster their fathers had tauoht them
</p>
<p>to believe it to be, or at least that now the ty-
</p>
<p>rant had grown mild and tolerant ? If this
</p>
<p>were the desicrn, no plan could have been more
</p>
<p>successful. Who that has visited Boston, does
</p>
<p>not know the epithets with which Bishop
</p>
<p>Cheverus' name is coupled? ^Th&good Bishopj

<p>been, and perhaps is true of the Bishop. The

</p>
<p>accomplished, and he receives the reward of a

<p>faithful servant from his foreign masters, in a

</p>
<p>his duties to foreign masters are performed, and

<p>then is rewarded by promotion at home to the

<p>nic. If Charles IX. had recoiled from the
</p>
<p>massacre of the Huguenots, he would certainly
</p>
<p>have perished a few weeks after upon the
</p>
<p>scaffold, as happened to the indulgent and
</p>
<p>compassionate Louis XVI., because he took an
</p>
<p>opposite course. He who in such a case has
</p>
<p>not the courage of a lion, and does not resolve
</p>
<p>on rigorous measures, is lost. The pusillani-
</p>
<p>mous alone are ignorant of this truth." Such
</p>
<p>shocking sentiments, be it remembered, are
</p>
<p>published in a country where there is a censor-
</p>
<p>ship of the press : and they are therefore the
</p>
<p>lano:uao:e of the o-overnment.

<p>* The Duke reasons like a true les^itimate.
</p>
<p>The happiness and lives of the people, to any
</p>
<p>amount, are mere chaff, compared with the
</p>
<p>happiness and life of that sainted bauble, called
</p>
<p>a kina:. His reasoninsr amounts to this : " better
</p>
<p>that thousands of the common people should
</p>
<p>perish by the bloodiest butchery, than that the
</p>
<p>single life of one human being endowed with
</p>
<p>divine right to reigii, should, like Louis XVI.
</p>
<p>perish on the scaffold." It is not necessary to
</p>
<p>uphold the shedding of royal blood, but there
</p>
<p>is a trick of kingcraft which ought to be exposedj
</p>
<p>because its influence is not unfelt in this coun-
</p>
<p>try. The divine right to reign is first assumed,
</p>
<p>then the human being thus invested with power
</p>
<p>partakes of diviniti/, he becomes sacred, and

<p>all the names and paraphernalia of idolatrous

<p>profligate, of a character that in common life
</p>
<p>would condemn her to the neglect of the world,

<p>and cast h*er out of all society. But she is a

<p>princess, she has a spark of royal divinity that
</p>
<p>shines upon her brazen front, and the duped
</p>
<p>multitude bow in adoration before her. Her
</p>
<p>sufferings, her wanderings, her dress in the

<p>minutest particulars, her words, lier looks, are
</p>
<p>the subject of sympathetic appeals to the com-

<p>passion of the world; ladies shed tears over the
</p>
<p>distresses of the unfortunate princess. Alas!

<p>alas ! that royal blood hould suffer ! And are

<p>Emigration and our Naturalization Law.
</p>
<p>The subject of efnigration is one of those
</p>
<p>which demands the immediate attention of the
</p>
<p>nation, it is a question which concerns all par-
</p>
<p>ties : and if the writer is not mistaken in his
</p>
<p>reading of the signs of the times, the country is
</p>
<p>waking to asenseof the alarming evil produced
</p>
<p>by our fiatui'alizationlsiws. Let us war among
</p>
<p>ourselves in party warfare, with every lawful
</p>
<p>weapon that we can convert to our purpose. It
</p>
<p>is our birthright to have our own opinion, and
</p>
<p>earnestly to contend for it ; but let us court no
</p>
<p>foreign friends. Every American should feel
</p>
<p>his national blood mount at the very thought of
</p>
<p>foreign interference. While we welcome the
</p>
<p>inteiri2:ent and persecuted of all nations, and
</p>
<p>give them an asylum and a share in our privi-
</p>
<p>leges, let us beware lest we admit to dangerous
</p>
<p>fellowship those who cannot and will not use
</p>
<p>our hospitality aright. That such may come,
</p>
<p>and do come, there is no reason to doubt. Con-

<p>given before a justice in Albany. He says that-

</p>
<p>Now here are forty paupers cast upon our
</p>
<p>shores from one parish in England, and m Jive
</p>
<p>years they become citizens, entitled to vote ! !
</p>
<p>Is there an American, of any party, who can
</p>
<p>beheve that there is no dansfer in admittino: to
</p>
<p>equal privileges with himself such a class of
</p>
<p>foreio^ners ? A remedy to this crying evil ad-
</p>
<p>mits of not a moment's delay. At this moment
</p>
<p>the ocean swarms with ships crowded with this
</p>
<p>wretched population, bearing them from misery
</p>
<p>abroad to misery here.
</p>
<p>The expense incurred in this city (New-
</p>
<p>York) for the support of foreign paupers, it is
</p>
<p>well known, is enormous. In Philadelphia
</p>
<p>more than three-fourths of the inmates of their
</p>
<p>Almshouse are foreigners. Whole families
</p>
<p>have been known to come from on board ship
</p>
<p>and 2:0 directly to the Almshouse. In the Bos-
</p>
<p>ton Dispensary there were the last year, (1834,)
</p>
<p>from two districts only, 477 patients ; of these
</p>
<p>441 v)ere foreigners ! ! leaving but 36 of our
</p>
<p>own population to be provided for. In the
</p>
<p>Boston Almshouse the following- returns show
</p>
<p>the increase of fon^ign paupers in five years :
</p>
<p>The year ending Sept. 30, 1829, Americans 395

</p>
<p>The year endinsr Sept. 30, 1834, Americans 340

</p>
<p>Thus we see that native pauperism has de-
</p>
<p>creased in five years, and foreign pauperism
</p>
<p>more than doubled.

</p>
<p>The first and immediate step that should be

</p>
<p>taken, is to press upon Cono^ress, and upon the
</p>
<p>nation, instant attention to the naturaliza-
</p>
<p>tion LAWS. We must first stop this leak in y
</p>
<p>the ship, through which the muddy waters <
</p>
<p>from without threaten to sink us. If we mean
</p>
<p>to keep our country, this Ufe-hoat of the world, ^
</p>
<p>from founderincr with all the crew, we will take ^
</p>
<p>on board no more from the European wreck -^
</p>
<p>until we have safely landed and sheltered its
</p>
<p>present freight. But w^ould you have us forfeit
</p>
<p>the character of the country as the asylum of
</p>
<p>the world ? No; but it is a mistaken philanthro-
</p>
<p>py indeed that would a.ttempt to save one at the
</p>
<p>expense of the lives of thousands ; that would
</p>
<p>receive into our famihes those dying with the
</p>
<p>plague. Our naturalization laws were never ^
</p>
<p>intended to convert this land into the almshouse ^
</p>
<p>of Europe, to cover the alarming importation of''
</p>
<p>every thing in the shape of man that European
</p>
<p>tyranny thinks fit to send adrift from its shores ;
</p>
<p>nor so to operate as to surrender back all the
</p>
<p>blessings of that freedom for which our fatliers
</p>
<p>paid so dear a price, into the keeping of our en-
</p>
<p>emies. No, we must have the law so amended
</p>
<p>that no FOREIGNER WHO MAY COME INTO THE^
</p>
<p>COUNTRY. AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE NEW ^
</p>
<p>LAW, SHALL EVER BE ALLOWED TO EXERCIPE ^

<p>THE ELECTIVE FRANCHISE. Tllis aloue mCCtS

<p>necessary, for the safety of our institutions, in

<p>institution, and act and do as the said B. J.
</p>
<p>Flaget is impowered by this act to do."
</p>
<p>The Bishop of Bardstown, in a letter to a
</p>
<p>friend in Europe, dated February, 1S25, says :
</p>
<p>'' Our legislature has just incorporated the col-
</p>

<p>have dictated conditions, which I could not

</p>
<p>and what is still more flattering is, tliat these
</p>
<p>privileges were granted almost without any
</p>
<p>discussion, and with unanimity in both houses."
</p>
<p>Now the Pope, it is well known, appoints all
</p>
<p>Bishops. Here then is one college in the coun-
</p>
<p>try, already placed in perpetuo under the ex-

<p>Glory- Giving Titles.
</p>
<p>One of the plainest doctrines of American

<p>Republicanism, which is essentially democratic,

<p>is, that mere glory-giving titles, or titles of ser-
</p>
<p>vility, are entirely opposed to its whole spirit.

<p>They are considered as one of those artificial
</p>
<p>means of kingcraft, by which it fosters that
</p>
<p>aristocratic, unholy pride in the human heart,
</p>
<p>which loves to domineer over its fellow-mari',
</p>
<p>which loves artificial distinction of ranks, a
</p>
<p>privileged class, and of course which helps to
</p>
<p>sustain that whole system of regal and papal
</p>
<p>usurpation which has so long cursed mankind.
</p>
<p>If such titles are to some extent still acknow-
</p>
<p>ledged in this country, they have either been
</p>
<p>thoughtlessly but unwisely used as mere epi-
</p>
<p>thets of courtesy, or they are the remains of old
</p>
<p>deep-rooted foreign habits, which, in spite of the
</p>
<p>uncongenial soil to which they have been trans-
</p>
<p>planted, still maintain a sort of vv^ithered exist-
</p>
<p>ence. It now, however, becomes a serious in-
</p>
<p>quiry whether this practice, hitherto seemingly
</p>
<p>unimportant, may not be attended with danger
</p>
<p>to the institutions of the country. For Popery,
</p>
<p>it appears, is already taking advantage of this,
</p>
<p>as of all other weaknesses in our habits and
</p>
<p>customs, to introduce its anti-democratic sys-
</p>
<p>tem, and this, too, while it manifests in words
</p>
<p>great zeal in defence of democratic liberty. Let
</p>
<p>the democracy look well to this.
</p>
<p>Is it asked to what extent should titles or
</p>
<p>names of distinction be abolished throughout
</p>
<p>the land ? the answer is plain. Every title that
</p>
<p>merely desio-nates an office, is perfectly in ac-
</p>
<p>cordance with our institutions ; such as Presi
</p>
<p>dent. Secretary, Senator, General, Commodore,

</p>
<p>If no farther proof were wanting of the f^i
</p>
<p>of the supreme intinence of the Cathohc prid^
</p>
<p>over the mob, it is opportunely furnished in the
</p>
<p>testimony on the trial of the rioters at Charles-
</p>
<p>town, (Mass.) Mr. Edward Cutter testified that
</p>
<p>the Lady Superior, in an interview previous to
</p>
<p>the burning of the Convent, thus threatened
</p>
<p>him; she said, " the Bishop had 20,000 of the
</p>
<p>vilest (or boldest) Irishmen under his control,
</p>
<p>who would tear down the houses of Mr. Cutter
</p>
<p>and others ; and that the selectmen of Charles-
</p>
<p>town mio-ht read the riot act till they were
</p>
<p>hoarse, and it would be of no use."
</p>
<p>But if any doubt is thrown over Mr. Cutter's
</p>
<p>testimony because he is a Protestant, hear what
</p>
<p>the Lady Superior herself testifies : " I told
</p>
<p>him," she says, " that the Right Reverend Bish-
</p>
<p>op's influence over ten thousand brave Irishmen
</p>
<p>mis:ht lead to the destruction of his property
</p>
<p>and that of others."
</p>
<p>Here we have the startling fact, acknowledg-
</p>
<p>ed in a court of justice by the Superior of the
</p>
<p>Convent, that the Bishop has such influence
</p>
<p>over a mob of foreigners, that he can use them
</p>
<p>for vengeance, or restrain them at pleasure. 
</p>
<p>The question that occurs is, how much strong-
</p>
<p>er is it necessary for this foreign corps to be-
</p>
<p>come liefore it may prudently act offensively
</p>

<p>rendered certain by this singular confession of

<p>the Lady Superior, and that is Roman Catho-
</p>
<p>lic interference in our elections. Jesuits are
</p>
<p>not in the habit of shghting their advantages,

<p>and the Bishop wlio can control ten or twenty
</p>
<p>thousand, or five hundred thousand men, as
</p>
<p>the case may be, for the purpose of destruction

<p>positive testimony of many persons, soon con-
</p>

<p>nounced to us was but too true.
</p>
<p>" It is then as certain, as it is s^reatly to be
</p>
<p>deplored, that the above-mentioned government
</p>
<p>has unjustly driven away him who represented
</p>
<p>our person and the Holy See, commanding him
</p>
<p>to quit the kingdom without delay. But, after
</p>
<p>so gross an insult offered to the Holy See, and
</p>
<p>to us, the audacity of these perverse men has
</p>
<p>been carried still further against the Catholic
</p>
<p>Church, as^ainst ecclesiastical property, against
</p>
<p>the inviolable rights of the Holy See. Consid-
</p>
<p>erino^ that all these measures have been exerci-
</p>
<p>sed almost at the accession of a new Power,
</p>
<p>and in consequence of a conspiracy prepared
</p>
<p>beforehand, our mind is filled with horror, and
</p>
<p>we cannot refrain from tears. All the public
</p>
<p>prisons have been opened, and, after having let
</p>
<p>those who were detained there go forth, they
</p>
<p>have thrown into them, in their place, some of
</p>
<p>those of whom it is written. Touch not my

<p>Anointed. Laymen have rashly arrogated to
</p>
<p>themselves a power over sacred things ; they

<p>have proclaimed a general reform of the secular
</p>
<p>clergy, and of religious orders of both sexes."
</p>
<p>After enumeratino- various acts of rigor of the
</p>
<p>new government against those priests, monks,

<p>State; which allows every man, without other
</p>
<p>impediment than the common olistacles of
</p>
<p>human nature, and the equal rights of his neigh-
</p>
<p>bor impose, to strive after wealth, and know-
</p>
<p>ledge, and happiness. True Christian repub-
</p>
<p>licanism, by its benevolent and ennobling
</p>
<p>principles, impels the wealthy and the "educa-
</p>
<p>ted to use their talents for the benefit of the
</p>
<p>whole community; it prompts to acts of public
</p>
<p>spirit, to self-sacrifice, and to unwearied efforts
</p>
<p>to lesson the natural obstacles in the way of the
</p>
<p>poor and uneducated to competence and intel-
</p>
<p>lectual character, by affording them both em-
</p>
<p>ployment and education. The kindness and
</p>
<p>benevolence thus shown to the poor, beget, in
</p>
<p>this class of our citizens, industry and mental
</p>
<p>effort. They feel that they are not like the
</p>
<p>proscribed of other countries ; they see that the
</p>
<p>way is equally open to all to rise to the same
</p>
<p>rank of independence in mind and condition,
</p>
<p>and they consequently are without the ex-
</p>
<p>citing causes of envy, and ill-will, and bitter-
</p>
<p>ness of feeling towards the wealthy and edu-
</p>
<p>cated, which exist and produce these fruits in
</p>
<p>other and arbitrary governments. Society in
</p>
<p>its two extremes is thus knit together by a
</p>
<p>mutual confidence, and a mutual interest ; for
</p>
<p>causes beyond human control are ever varying
</p>
<p>the condition of men. He that is rich to-day
</p>
<p>may be poor to-morrow ; and thus there is a

<p>constant interchange, a mingling of ranks,

<p>which, like a heathful circulation in the natural

<p>naturally and justly excluded from the benefits

<p>of this system.
</p>
<p>Let us now look at the condition of these
</p>
<p>same classes under an arbitrary government.
</p>
<p>In Austria, for example, the jjoor and Illiterate
</p>
<p>are considered as the natural slaves of the
</p>
<p>wealthy and learned. These classes are per-
</p>
<p>petually separated by the artificial barrier of
</p>
<p>hereditary right ; the line of separation is dis-
</p>
<p>tincdy drawn, and in all that relates to social
</p>
<p>intercourse there js an impassable gulf. There
</p>
<p>may be condescension on the one part, but no
</p>
<p>elevation on the other. High birth, learning,
</p>
<p>wealth, and polished manners are on the one
</p>
<p>side, strengthening the hands of the arbitrary
</p>
<p>power that sustains them ; on the other, low
</p>
<p>birth, ignorance, poverty, and boorishness, kept
</p>
<p>down by their intrinsic weakness, generation
</p>
<p>after generation, in irretrievable subjection; the
</p>
<p>upper classes knowing that their own security
</p>
<p>is based upon the perpetuity of ig^norance and
</p>
<p>superstition in the lower classes. Now, to
</p>
<p>make the change from republicanism to abso-
</p>
<p>lutism, what means would an arbitrary power
</p>
<p>like Austria be most likely to devise ? AVould
</p>
<p>she not attain her object entirely by the creation
</p>
<p>on the one hand, in the wealth and talent of
</p>
<p>this country, a necessity for employing physi-
</p>
<p>cal force, to hold in subjection the poor and
</p>
<p>illiterate? and the production, on the other
</p>
<p>hand, of a class ignorant and unprincipled, and
</p>
<p>turbulent enough to need the very restraints the

<p>foreign servitude abroad. How could Austrian

<p>emissaries better serve their imperial master's

<p>interert, than by keeping these unenlightened
</p>
<p>men in the same micntal darkness in which
</p>
<p>they existed in the countries from which they

<p>caiTie, surroundiuo^ them here with a police of

<p>priests, and shutting out from them the light

</p>
<p>of light, nourishing them for riot and turbu-
</p>
<p>lence at political meetings, and for bullying at
</p>
<p>the polls those of opposite political opinions?
</p>
<p>And what would be the effect of such a mode

<p>of proceedings upon that class who have ac-
</p>
<p>quired, by lives of honest industry and studious

<p>tives of self-preservation, be willing to adopt

<p>any system of measures, however arbitrary,
</p>
<p>which will secure society from violence and
</p>
<p>anarchy ? When disgust at priest-guided mobs
</p>
<p>shall have alienated the minds of one class of

<p>the citizens from the other, we have then one
</p>
<p>of the parties nearly formed, which is neces-
</p>
<p>sary for the designs of despotism in accom-

<p>plishing the subversion of the republic. And
</p>
<p>the otJicr farty is still easier formed. The
</p>
<p>alienation of feeling in the wealthier class, and
</p>
<p>their remarks of disgust, may be easily tortured
</p>
<p>into contempt for the classes below them, and
</p>
<p>then the natural envy of the poor towards the

<p>rich will always furnish occasions to excite to

<p>violence. When hostility between these two

<p>158 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>has so long held in unacconntable stupor the
</p>
<p>senses of the people, which has shut their eyes
</p>
<p>and stopped their ears to the proofs of foreign con-
</p>
<p>spiracy which everywhere surrounded them,
</p>
<p>the mis^hty crathering of all real patriots to the
</p>
<p>defence of their liberties, which the sounds of
</p>
<p>preparation from all quarters of the land but
</p>
<p>too strongly indicate, may be attended with ef-
</p>
<p>fects disastrous to the cause of true liberty  may
</p>
<p>produce, through 63xcess or ill-regulated zeal,
</p>
<p>the evil which it is desirous to remedy ; for ex-
</p>
<p>cess, even in favor of right principles, doubles
</p>
<p>the amount of the evil which it attempts to
</p>
<p>cure. Excess of all kinds, whether in thought,
</p>
<p>word, or action, (O that this could be impressed
</p>
<p>on every American heart !) is just so much
</p>
<p>gain to the side of Popery. I know not how
</p>
<p>prevalent is error on this point, but I am per-
</p>
<p>suaded that it exists to an extent to make an
</p>
<p>American tremble for the permanency of our
</p>
<p>democratic institutions.
</p>
<p>Is there not a culpable acquiescence in the
</p>
<p>doina^s of a mob, if their violence is directed
</p>
<p>against some apparent or real irritating popular
</p>
<p>evil? Is not the language of such acquiescence
</p>
<p>most dangerous? It amounts to this: "Al-
</p>
<p>though we are averse to mob-law, yet, on the
</p>
<p>whole, there are cases where the sin is venial,
</p>
<p>and the character of the nuisance it would
</p>
<p>abate justifies its violence." Now, once con-
</p>

</p>
<p>which makes its own laws according to modes

</p>
<p>let me ask. where is s^overnment? It is pros-
</p>
<p>trated. It has become anarchy, and on the ru-
</p>
<p>ins of social order will arise another form of
</p>
<p>government, more or less arbitrary^ according
</p>
<p>to the more or less profound causes which
</p>
<p>effected the destruction of the first. Of all forms
</p>
<p>of government, a truly democratic government,
</p>
<p>while it is least obnoxious to the disturbing in-
</p>
<p>fluences of mobs, can at the same time least of
</p>
<p>aU bear the shocks of their turbulence. No
</p>
<p>events, therefore, that have occurred in the
</p>
<p>eventful history of the country, have so justly
</p>
<p>caused alarm for the stability of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment, as the spirit of mob-violence which has
</p>
<p>lately manifested itself so frequently in our
</p>
<p>large cities. We should do well to remember
</p>
<p>tha^t we have secret and artful enemies busily
</p>
<p>at work, who can and will take advantage of
</p>
<p>this unnatural state of the public feeling, and
</p>
<p>who will not fail secretly to administer fuel, in
</p>
<p>modes in which they are perfectly familiar, to a
</p>
<p>diseased excitement so favorable to their views.
</p>
<p>We have in the country a powerful religious-
</p>
<p>politico sect, whose final success depends on the
</p>
<p>subversion of these democratic institutions, and
</p>
<p>who have therefore a vital interest in promoting
</p>
<p>mob-violence. The saying of the German Am-
</p>
<p>bassador concernins: the Papists, (quoted in the
</p>
<p>prefatory remarks,) is full of meaning, and
</p>
<p>should be constantly borne in mind ; it lets us
</p>
<p>into the secret of their manoeuvring in this

</p>
<p>in power, and conseqtiently nnabie to persecute,
</p>
<p>they will be sure to conduct, either in so outra-
</p>
<p>geous, or mysterious, or deceptive a manner, as
</p>
<p>to rouse pnbliQ indignation. They will con-
</p>
<p>trive ingenious modes of irritation that shall
</p>
<p>draw upon them popular vengeance, and then
</p>
<p>all meekness, and innocence, and resignation,
</p>
<p>raise the implorinof cry of persecution. And
</p>
<p>how do they gain by these opiposite modes? If
</p>
<p>they are strong enough to persecute, they will
</p>
<p>destroy their opponents,?';?, obedience to theopen-
</p>
<p>ly avoioed principhs of their sect, by exile, by
</p>
<p>dungeons, and by death. If they themselves
</p>
<p>are persecuted in a Protestant community, (Pro-
</p>
<p>testant principles being in known direct opposi-
</p>
<p>tion to persecution,) it is always by an irreli-
</p>
<p>gious mob, acting in defiance of Protestant
</p>
<p>principle, and unsustained by public opinion,
</p>
<p>and the reaction of Protestant sympathy for the
</p>
<p>sufferers on any such occasion, more than makes
</p>
<p>amends, by its gifts, for the injury sustained.
</p>
<p>Thus the very virtues of Protestants, growing
</p>
<p>out of principles directly antao;onist to Popish
</p>
<p>principles, are made to work ag-ainst Protest-
</p>
<p>antism, and in favor of Popery. Do not Jesuits
</p>
<p>know the well known truth, that a sect is helped
</p>
<p>by a little persecution? Do they not now act
</p>
<p>upon a knowledge of it ? And should not Amer-
</p>
<p>icans replenish their memory with it also, that
</p>
<p>they may most rigidly abstain from disorder,
</p>
<p>and discountenance every disposition to riot or
</p>
<p>violence ? Let them remember that the laws

<p>that govern them are their own laws, and they

</p>
<p>good order, by firmness of resistance to every
</p>
<p>.temptation to riot, defeat the designs of these
</p>
<p>worst enemies of Democracy.
</p>
<p>In close connexion with this topic, is that of
</p>
<p>the kind of treatment vAiidi Protestant Amer-
</p>
<p>icans should show to Catholic emigrants.
</p>
<p>On this subject a volume conld be written. I
</p>
<p>have space but for a few remarks.
</p>
<p>The condition of the Catholic emigrants that
</p>
<p>are daily pouring into the country from Ger-
</p>
<p>many and Ireland, should awaken the strongest
</p>
<p>sympathies of Americans ; and in whatever as-
</p>
<p>pect viewed, should enlist all their feelings of
</p>
<p>benevolence. Reflect a moment who and what
</p>
<p>they are. We have read, and our own coun-
</p>
<p>trymen who have travelled and seen them in
</p>
<p>their native land, bear testimony to the effects
</p>
<p>upon the people of the grinding oppressions of
</p>
<p>Papal government; to the mental degradation ;
</p>
<p>to the poverty, to the wretchedness of the vas-
</p>
<p>sals of despotism. And as if to prove to us what
</p>
<p>we might doubt on the authority of others, so
</p>
<p>sombre is their picture of human misery, the
</p>
<p>very subjects of foreign oppression are brought
</p>
<p>and placed before our eyes. See yonder ship
</p>
<p>slowly furling her sails. She approaches the city.
</p>
<p>She casts her anchor. Who are those that crowd
</p>
<p>her decks ? With eager eyes they gaze in one
</p>
<p>direction. They see, at length, the far-famed
</p>
<p>land of liberty. Yes ; its name lias been waft-
</p>

<p>Americans, see before you the fruits of jiapal

<p>gradation, moral and physical, that you turn

<p>away in disirust from the sight. But why should

<p>this be? They .'vre hunian beino-s, althonorh

<p>oppression has l)lotted out their reason, and

</p>
<p>geny of Popery ; they are the victims of its iron
</p>
<p>despotism. It is Popery that lias reared them
</p>
<p>up in its own caverns of superstition. They
</p>
<p>exhibit before you the blio-hting effects of this-

<p>scourge of the earth. It is Popery tliat has filled
</p>
<p>their n^inds v.'ith puerile fables, closed their men-

</p>
<p>stifled at their birth, they are cast upon our

<p>care mere human machines, for the fell usurp-

<p>ers of God's power have torn out of them their

<p>liberty, indeed, but what shape has liberty

<p>licentiousness, their freedom, strife and de-

</p>
<p>And now with what emotions should Protest-
</p>
<p>ants look on these suffering, deluded men? In
</p>
<p>what channel should their sympathies flow?
</p>
<p>They have already been beaten to the dust by
</p>
<p>tyranny. Is it for freemen to follow up the cruel
</p>
<p>blow of foreign tyrants ? They have been
</p>
<p>brutalized by neglect ; shall they be now hunt-
</p>
<p>ed by proscription ? Shall no Christian effort
</p>
<p>be made to light up again in their darkened
</p>
<p>bosoms the extinguished spark of humanity?
</p>
<p>They are followed into our habitations ; yes,
</p>
<p>Americans, they are pursued into your own

<p>asylum of liberty by their foreign oppressors,
</p>
<p>who, like hungry wolves, have ventured with
</p>
<p>unhallowed feet into the very sanctuary of free-
</p>
<p>dom to grasp again their scarcely escaped prey.
</p>
<p>And have Americans no compassion? Have
</p>
<p>they no courairc ? Will they not protect the
</p>
<p>oppressed ? Will they not interpose between
</p>
<p>them and their priestly oppressors, and say to
</p>
<p>the latter, ' Stand off; this is a land of freedom;

<p>or apathy of the people, are every day, I mio-ht
</p>
<p>say eA^ery hoar, more manifest, and they are
</p>
<p>prosecuted with a boldness, with an audacious
</p>
<p>detiauce of American habits, and the feelings
</p>
<p>of American republica.nism, truly astonishing.
</p>
<p>Yet, upon reflection, is it so astonishing that a
</p>
<p>tyranny of such inexhaustible resources of cun-
</p>
<p>ning aiid artifice, backed by the treasures and
</p>
<p>the open encouragement of the arbitrary gov-
</p>
<p>ernments of Europe, should be more than or-
</p>
<p>dinarily hold / For if success attends the
</p>
<p>advauce of these arch intriguers against our
</p>
<p>Protestant habits and institutions, high honors
</p>
<p>and pecuniary rewards await them at home: if
</p>
<p>detection at any time Overtakes them, from the
</p>
<p>sudden wakino- of their victim, and his restive
</p>
<p>efforts to break off the bands that they would,
</p>
<p>spider-like, softly bind upon hini, they have
</p>
<p>a retreat from punishment in their own coun-
</p>
<p>try. A new experiment, anotlier step for-
</p>
<p>ward in the march against our freedom, (and
</p>
<p>to all appearances, at present, a successful
</p>
<p>one.) has been tried at the West, at St. Louis,
</p>
<p>in the consecration of the Popish cathedral.
</p>
<p>The account is from a Popish journal, called
</p>
<p>the Catholic Telegraph. They shall have the
</p>
<p>benefit of their own recital.
</p>
<p>' The cathedral of St. Louis is 134 feet long,
</p>
<p>by 84 wide. There are 8 rows of pews, 25 in
</p>
<p>each row, calculated to contain at least 8,000
</p>
<p>persons. There are two magnificent colonnades
</p>
<p>at opposite sides in the body of the church, con-

</p>
<p>'The altar is of stone. It is only temporary,
</p>
<p>and will soon be superseded by a superb mar-
</p>
<p>ble altar, which is hourly expected from Italy.
</p>
<p>' The church, it is said, has already cost
</p>
<p>$42,000. It is presumed that about $18,000
</p>
<p>more will be required to finish it, according: to
</p>
<p>the original and magnificent design of its foun-
</p>
<p>ders; so that the entire cost of the building and
</p>
<p>its furniture cannot be less than 60,000.
</p>
<p>" The consecration took place on the Sab-
</p>
<p>bath, October 2(3, 1834.
</p>
<p>" At an early hour, 7 A. M. on the day of
</p>
<p>consecration, four Bishops, twenty-eight Priests,
</p>
<p>twelve of whom were from twelve different
</p>
<p>nations, and a considerable number of young
</p>
<p>aspirants to the holy ministry, making the en-
</p>
<p>tire ecclesiastical corps amount to fifty or sixty,
</p>
<p>were habited in their appropriate dresses. As
</p>
<p>soon as the 'procession was organized^ the
</p>
<p>pealing of three large and clear-sounding bells,
</p>
<p>the thunder of two pieces of artillery raised all
</p>
<p>hearts, as well as our own, to the Great Al-
</p>
<p>mighty Being.
</p>
<p>" When the holy relics were moved to-
</p>
<p>wards their new habitation, where they shall
</p>
<p>enjoy an anticipated resurrection  the presence
</p>
<p>of their God in this holy tabernacle, the guns
</p>
<p>fired a second salute. We felt as if the soul
</p>
<p>of St. Louis, Christian, Lawgiver, and Hero,
</p>
<p>was in the sound, and that he again led on his
</p>
<p>victorious armies in the service of the God of
</p>
<p>Hosts, for the defence of his religon, his sepul
</p>
<p>chre, and his people.

</p>
<p>What are the reflections. of an American on
</p>
<p>an occurrence Uke this ? What must they be
</p>
<p>to one who has ever felt his pride of country
</p>
<p>stir within liim, when in foreign lands he has
</p>
<p>beheld the de^^raded slaves of despotism bow in

<p>like manner before the altars and idols of hea-

<p>thenish superstition, awed into seeming rever-
</p>
<p>ence by the military array which always
</p>
<p>accompanies the imposing ceremonial of the
</p>
<p>Popish church? But the military were only a
</p>
<p>guard of honor ! Yes, this is the soft name given
</p>
<p>to this despotic chain, the musical sound to
</p>
<p>charm us away from scrutinizing it; audit will be
</p>
<p>sufficient, doubtless, to drown its harsher clank-
</p>
<p>ing in our torpid ears. The guard of honor, that
</p>
<p>universal appendage of kings and sacred des-
</p>
<p>pots, is a serviceable band. It not only helps
</p>
<p>to swell a procession by its numbers, but with
</p>
<p>the o-litter of its arms, and accoutrements, and
</p>
<p>gay bamiers, it adds splendor to the pageant of
</p>
<p>a lieathen ritual. But, reader, it has an essen-

<p>wards me slowly advanced a long procession,
</p>
<p>Adecked out with alt the heathenish parapher-
</p>
<p>nalia of this self-styled church. In a part of
</p>
<p>the procession a lofty baldichino, or canopy,
</p>
<p>borne by men, was held above the idol, the host,
</p>
<p>before which, as it passed, all heads were un-
</p>
<p>covered, and every knee bent but mine. Igno-
</p>
<p>rant of the customs of heathanism, I turned my
</p>
<p>back to the procession, and close to the side of
</p>
<p>the houses in the crowd, (as I supposed unob-
</p>
<p>served,) I was noting in my tablets the order of
</p>
<p>the assemblage. I was suddenly aroused from
</p>
<p>my occupation, and staga:ered by a blow upon
</p>
<p>the head from the gun and bayonet of a sol-
</p>
<p>dier, which struck' off my hat far into the
</p>
<p>crowd. Upon recovering from the shock,
</p>
<p>the soldier, with the expression of a demon,
</p>
<p>and his mouth pouring forth a torrent of Ital-
</p>
<p>ian oaths, in which il diavolo had a prom-
</p>
<p>inent place, stood with his bayonet against
</p>
<p>my breast. I could make no resistance, 1 could
</p>
<p>only ask him why he struck me, and receive in
</p>
<p>answer his fresh volley of unintelligible impre-
</p>
<p>cations, which havmg delivered, he resumed

<p>his place in the guard of honor, by the side of

<p>the ofiiciating Cardinal.
</p>
<p>Americans will not fail to observe in the pre-

<p>cious extract of the discourse in which the

</p>
<p>tier feelings of the soul than this  "it would be
</p>
<p>the pride of my soul to take the brave men by
</p>
<p>the hand by whom these cannons were served."
</p>
<p>Why? Is it such a brave act to touch off a
</p>
<p>cannon ? Or was the imagination of the priest
</p>
<p>revelhng in the dream of seeing the military

<p>beck and service of the Pope, and his Austrian

</p>
<p>THE MASK THROWN ASIDE.
</p>
<p>A charge of hostility to American institutions,
</p>
<p>against any sect or class in the community, is
</p>
<p>a very serious one, and only requires evidence
</p>
<p>to support it, to draw upon all its doinsfs the
</p>
<p>watchful eye of American freemen. It is ask-
</p>
<p>ed, what evidence should you think sufficiently
</p>
<p>strong to substantiate the charge? I answer,
</p>
<p>the general principles of the sect would be suf-
</p>
<p>ficient, but its own declarations of hostility
</p>
<p>would certainly substantiate the charge. If a
</p>
<p>Presbyterian journal, in commentins^ on tbe
</p>
<p>trial of the rioters in Charlestown, should make
</p>
<p>remarks like the following, the evidence would
</p>
<p>doubtless be considered complete.
</p>
<p>' A system of government which admits a feeling of
</p>
<p>alarm, in the execution of the laws, from the vengeance of
</p>
<p>the mob, which Mr. Austin," (the prosecuting attorney)
</p>
<p>" distinctly allows to be the case  a vengeance exhibited
</p>
<p>by letters to the public officers, and threats to the public
</p>
<p>authorities  may be very fine in theory, very fit for imitoMon

</p>
<p>nature to invite the reflectiHg part of the irorld, and sko-ws
</p>
<p>at least that it has evils. A public officer in England, who
</p>
<p>would publicly avow such a fear of executing his duty and
</p>
<p>carrying into effect the law of the realm, ousrht and would
</p>
<p>be thrust out of office by public opinion. This one fact is
</p>
<p>condemnation of the system of American institutions,
</p>
<p>confirmed latehj by numerous other proofs."
</p>
<p>Now, could hostility to our institutions be
</p>
<p>more strongly expressed ? and were Presbyte-
</p>
<p>rians, or any other Protestant sect, thus boldly
</p>
<p>to avow its political antipathies, every political
</p>
<p>journal would seize upon this evidence of trea-
</p>
<p>son, and trumpet it throuo-h the whole country.
</p>
<p>Why then are they now silent? This treason
</p>
<p>is actually uttered; nor is it less humiliating,
</p>
<p>or less dano^erous, that it is flung in our faces
</p>
<p>by a set of foreigners in the employment and
</p>
<p>pay of a foreign government, instead of native
</p>
<p>citizens. The very words I have quoted are
</p>
<p>from the Catholic Telegraph, a Roman Catho-^
</p>
<p>He journal, edited and published at Cincinnati.
</p>
<p>Let it be borne in mind too, that a Catholic
</p>
<p>journal is under the supervision of the Bishops,
</p>
<p>who exercise a rigid censorship over it; that it
</p>
<p>speaks the authorized sentiments of the sect ;
</p>
<p>and we shall then perceive something of the im-
</p>
<p>portance to be attached to these anti-republican
</p>
<p>declarations. They are indeed a precious, an in-
</p>
<p>valuable testimonial to the people, of the duplici-
</p>
<p>ty of their professed friends. Everywhere in

<p>experiment that has failed: that ^'American

<p>confession ; what has occurred to make it a fit
</p>
<p>time to lay aside the disguise in which they have
</p>
<p>till now deceived the democracy of the country ?
</p>
<p>What has produced this sudden revolution in
</p>
<p>their opinion of our form of government '} Let
</p>
<p>us look into this matter.
</p>
<p>A body of native citizens is excited to indig- ^
</p>
<p>nation by rumors (whether true or false alters
</p>
<p>not the case) that an act of foul play, such as
</p>
<p>the history of those nuisances (convents) in all
</p>
<p>countries have abundantly furnished, had oc-
</p>
<p>curred in the Charlestown Nunnery. This mob,
</p>
<p>instead of beins: met with efforts to appease it
</p>
<p>by immediate explanation, as would have been
</p>
<p>the case in any Protestant seminary in the land,
</p>
<p>(for Protestants have no secret mysteries in
</p>
<p>their disciphne.) this mob, I say, is kept for
</p>
<p>days in an excited state, by mysterious manoeu-
</p>
<p>vrinsf on tlie part of the Catholics, and by
</p>
<p>irritating threats from the Superior of the Con-
</p>
<p>vent, that 20.000 foreigners, under the orders
</p>
<p>of the Bishop, would take vengeance upon the
</p>
<p>citizens if they dared to commit an injury up-
</p>
<p>on the Convent, and this threat was uttered in
</p>
<p>sight of Bunker hill. Under this provocation
</p>
<p>the outrao-e was committed. And is it a mat- y

<p>ter of surprise? I know of no one who justi-

</p>
<p>fies the illegal violence in burning the Convent,
</p>
<p>170 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>but I unhesitatingly say, that the feehng of in-
</p>
<p>dignation which animated the populace, was
</p>
<p>a just and proper feehng. It was roused by
</p>
<p>the belief that a yovuig and helpless female had
</p>
<p>been illegally and cruelly abducted from her
</p>
<p>friends, and subjected to a secret tyrannical
</p>
<p>punishment. The feeling, I say, under this
</p>
<p>belief, was not only honorable to the Charles-
</p>
<p>towniaus, but, had they viewed such an out-
</p>
<p>rage with indifference, they would have shown
</p>
<p>themselves unworthy of American citizens.
</p>
<p>Their error (and it cannot be defended, how-
</p>
<p>ever it may he palliated by the gross insult
</p>
<p>whicli they received) consisted in suffering
</p>
<p>their just indignation to flow in an illegal chan-
</p>
<p>nel, and instead of rallying round the laws,
</p>
<p>and strengthening tJiem by a strong expression
</p>
<p>of public opinion at a special meeting of citi-
</p>
<p>zens, they leaped the bounds of law, and com-
</p>
<p>mitted a crime which the Papists are trying
</p>
<p>every possible means to cause to react in
</p>
<p>their favor. But allowing that no palliating
</p>
<p>circumstances attended the act of the rioters,
</p>
<p>that no excuse could be pleaded for them, as
</p>
<p>acting under the impulse of the most stino^ing
</p>
<p>insult that could be given to any people by a
</p>
<p>foreigner; what have these acts to do with our
</p>
<p>"system of irovernment;" or with "American
</p>
<p>institutions?" In Enoland, forsooth, they man-
</p>
<p>ao-e thino-s better. There arc never riots in

</p>
<p>these places, under various systems of 2:overn>
</p>
<p>ment, are ever witnesses to riots ! But this
</p>
<p>Popish enemy to our institutions may say, it is
</p>
<p>not the riot, but the threatening letters sent to
</p>
<p>the prosecuting attorney to intimidate him in
</p>
<p>his duty, that tells against the 2;overnment.
</p>
<p>Indeed ; and who wrote the letters? Is it quite
</p>
<p>certain thai they were not the production of
</p>
<p>some Jesuit, to fan an excitement which w.as
</p>
<p>so likely to be turned to the advantage of his
</p>
<p>schemes? Threatening letters are much in use
</p>
<p>in a certain Catholic country called Ireland, un-
</p>
<p>der a monarchical system of government. But
</p>
<p>suppose these letters were not written by Jesu-
</p>
<p>its, but were the production of some wicked or
</p>
<p>thoughtless person, what then? Is our form
</p>
<p>of government the cause of the writing of an-
</p>
<p>onymous threatening letters? Would any
</p>
<p>other form of government prevent this evil, of
</p>
<p>so alarminof magnitude in the eyes of the
</p>
<p>Catholic Telegraph? Can it be prevented in
</p>
<p>Eno^land, or in any other form of govermxient
</p>
<p>in the world ? Yes, there is one government
</p>
<p>which could probably prevent it. It is one in
</p>
<p>which the Inquisition is established, and by
</p>
<p>means of which, aided by the confessional, all
</p>
<p>that is considered necessary for the good of
</p>

<p>these busy foreign emissaries, depends on the
</p>
<p>178 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>continuance of the character for sagacity, in-
</p>
<p>teUio-ence, and virtue of the American people.
</p>
<p>Whatever doubts some may Iiave hitherto
</p>
<p>had with resrard to the existence of a foreign
</p>
<p>conspiracy in the country, I thinlv the case is
</p>
<p>now become too plain to need furtlier proof.
</p>
<p>Indeed, so bold are these foreign emissaries in
</p>
<p>the utterance of their anti-republican dogmas,
</p>
<p>so unbhishing in their attacks upon our institu-
</p>
<p>tions, that we are often led to exclaim, wiiat
</p>
<p>does this mean? Are these men fools, or mad-
</p>
<p>men? or are they so strong iu their support
</p>
<p>from abroad, that they feel secure in bearding
</p>
<p>American freemen in their own homes? The
</p>
<p>latter supposition alone satisfactorily explains
</p>
<p>their conduct. Austria is now playing a des-
</p>
<p>perate game against liberty, for the safety of
</p>
<p>her own throne, and for that of her allies. It is
</p>
<p>the last hazard, and her object is gained if she
</p>
<p>can destroy the influence of our prosperity
</p>
<p>upon the people of Europe, a prosperity the
</p>
<p>natural result of our popular free institutions ;
</p>
<p>and this latter object is effected, if, hy any
</p>
<p>}?ieans, no matter how, riot and disorder can
</p>
<p>be produced in this country, to be pointed at as
</p>
<p>the effect of republican government. Amer-
</p>
<p>icans ! Friends to liberty ! Friends of order !
</p>
<p>examine this subject, and decide with your
</p>
<p>usual sagacity and discretion. You have a
</p>
<p>busy, a crafty, a powerful, a dangerous set of
</p>
<p>foreign leaders controllins; and commanding a

</p>
<p>Shrink not, Americans, from looking at the
</p>
<p>truth. You may boast of your peace and pros-

<p>perity ; you hold them both, at this moment^
</p>
<p>at tJce mercy of Austria ! She has a disci-
</p>
<p>plined band of foreigners in the midst of you,
</p>
<p>who, in any season of excitement, she can
</p>
<p>make to fill your streets and dwelhngs with fear
</p>
<p>and confusion. She may not think it prudent
</p>
<p>or expedient just now to exercise her power,
</p>
<p>but she has the power, through Popish priests,
</p>
<p>who hold in cheeky at their jdeasure^ the ele-
</p>
<p>ments of discord^ and whose favor you are
</p>
<p>compelled humbly to conciliate as tJie price of
</p>
<p>your tranquillity. And this power is daily in-

<p>creasino^, not merely by foreign emigration,
</p>
<p>and foreign money, but, with the deepest shame
</p>
<p>be it spoken, by the assistance, direct and indi-

<p>with a facility most marvellous, fall into every

<p>.THE LETTER OfBiSHOP FeNWICK, OfOhIO,
</p>
<p>TO THE Emperor of Austria, and Prince
</p>
<p>Metternich's answer, are appended.
</p>
<p>Rules of the institution erected under the
</p>
<p>name of the Leopold Foundation,, for aid-
</p>
<p>ing Catholic missions in America,, hy con-
</p>
<p>tributions in the Austrian empire.
</p>
<p>1. The objects of the institution, nndei* the
</p>
<p>name of the Leopold Foundation, are, (a) To
</p>
<p>promote the greater activity of Catholic mis-
</p>
<p>sions in America; (b) To edify Christians by
</p>
<p>enhsting; them in the work of propag-atiiig the
</p>
<p>Church of Jesus Christ in the remote parts of
</p>
<p>the earth ; (c) To preserve in lastinsf remem-
</p>
<p>brance her deceased Majesty, Leopoldina, Em-
</p>
<p>press of Brazil, born Archduchess of Austria.
</p>
<p>2. The means selected to attain these ends,
</p>
<p>are Prayer and Alms.
</p>
<p>3. Every member of this religions institution
</p>
<p>engages daily to olfer one Pater and Ave, with
</p>
<p>the addition : " St. Leopold ! pray for tis"
</p>
<p>and every week to contribute a crucifix ; and
</p>
<p>thus by this small sacrifice of prayer and alms,
</p>
<p>to concur in the great work of promoting the
</p>
<p>true faith. As, however, every one is free to
</p>
<p>enroll himself in this society, he may also leave
</p>
<p>it at pleasure.
</p>
<p>4. Every ten members shall appoint one of

<p>their number a Collector, to receive the weekly
</p>
<p>APPENDIX. 183
</p>
<p>alms. The collector shall see that the small
</p>
<p>number of his company, after the death or re-
</p>
<p>moval of any, is filled up. The alms collected
</p>
<p>shall be paid monthly, by the collector, to the
</p>
<p>parish minister of his district.
</p>
<p>5. Every parish minister shall pay over, as
</p>
<p>opportimity oiferSjthe alms collected in the man-
</p>
<p>ner prescribed, to the deacon, (in Hungary the
</p>
<p>vice archdeacon,) and he to his most reverend
</p>
<p>ordinariate.
</p>
<p>6. If any one intends a greater sum for this
</p>
<p>pious end, and that to he paid at once, his alms
</p>
<p>may be given either to the parish minister, with
</p>
<p>his own inscription inserted in the rubric de-
</p>
<p>signed, or to the deacon, (or vice-deacon.) or
</p>
<p>immediately to the most reverend ordinariate.
</p>
<p>7. The most illustrious and reverend lords
</p>
<p>bishops of the whole empire are fully author-
</p>
<p>ized to forv/ard the alms thus obtained, from
</p>
<p>time to time, to the central direction of this re-
</p>
<p>ligious institution, at Vienna.
</p>
<p>8. The central direction at Vienna under-
</p>
<p>takes the grateful office of carrying into eftect
</p>
<p>this pious work, under the protection of his
</p>
<p>most sacred majesty, and in connexion with
</p>
<p>Frederick Rese, now Vicar-General of the Cin-
</p>
<p>cinnati bishopric in North America, and of
</p>
<p>employing the funds in the most efficacious
</p>
<p>manner to promote the glory of God and true
</p>
<p>faith in Jesus Christ ; so that the alms collect-
</p>
<p>ed by means of the most reverend ordinariates,
</p>
<p>or those sent immediately to them, shall be con-
</p>
<p>scientiously applied, and in the most economi-

</p>
<p>missions, as they are made known by authentic
</p>
<p>accounts and careful investigation.
</p>
<p>9. The central direction will see that all the
</p>
<p>members of the society, lor their spiritual con-
</p>
<p>solation, and in reward for their pious zeal, shall
</p>
<p>bo constantly informed of the progress and
</p>
<p>fruits of their munificence, as well as of the
</p>
<p>state of the Catholic Religion in America, ac-
</p>
<p>cording to the accounts received.
</p>
<p>10. The Leopold Foundation, being a pri-
</p>
<p>vate religious institution, the central direction
</p>
<p>will solemnly celebrate the feast of the immac-
</p>
<p>ulate conception of the Blessed Virgin, the uni-
</p>
<p>versal patroness of all religions assemblies, as the
</p>
<p>feast of the Foundation; but will also celebrate
</p>
<p>the feast of St. Leopold Marchion, the given
</p>
<p>nam.e of the Empress Leopoldina and special
</p>
<p>patroness of this institution ; and also every
</p>
<p>year on the 11th of December, (the anniversa
</p>
<p>ry day of the death of I^eopoldina, Empress of
</p>
<p>Brazil,) it will see that the solemn mass for the
</p>
<p>dead be said for the repose of her soul, and all
</p>
<p>the souls of the deceased patrons and benefac-
</p>
<p>tors of the institution called by her name, all
</p>
<p>the members being invited to unite their pious
</p>
<p>prayers with the prayers of the Direction.
</p>
<p>11. His Holiness, Pope Leo XIL eleven days
</p>
<p>before his most pious death, having declared
</p>
<p>his approbation of the institution (which must
</p>
<p>serv^e as a great incitement to all good chris-
</p>
<p>tians) did grant to its members large indulgen-
</p>
<p>ces, in an express letter, the publication of

<p>the most weighty discharge of our apostieship,
</p>
<p>while we learn that some are not only opposed

<p>to the catholic religion, but seek to draw others
</p>
<p>also into error ; yet the God of all consolation

<p>does not suffer us to be without solace, but al-

<p>pened, and we are filled with the highest joy,
</p>
<p>on hearing that in the kingdom of our well be-
</p>
<p>loved son in Christ, Francis I., Emperor of
</p>
<p>Austria and King of Hungary, a society has
</p>
<p>been formed called the "Leopold Foundation,"
</p>
<p>which is designed to aid the cause of missions.
</p>
<p>For what is more useful to a christian communi-
</p>
<p>ty, what is more excellent than by the preaching
</p>
<p>the word of God to confirm the just, and to lead
</p>
<p>the wandering from the paths of vice to those
</p>
<p>of salvation ? And indeed, as the Apostle says,
</p>
<p>" How shall they believe on him of whom they
</p>
<p>have not heard? and how shall they hear with-
</p>
<p>out a preacher, and how shall they preach ex-
</p>
<p>cept they be sent ?" , We, therefore, desiring to
</p>
<p>favor, as far as God permits, such a society, do
</p>
<p>with a ready and willino; mind grant the re-
</p>
<p>quests which have been made for the endow-
</p>
<p>ment of the same with some holy indulgences.
</p>
<p>Therefore, trusting in the mercy of Almighty
</p>
<p>God, and the authority of Peter and Paul, his
</p>
<p>apostles, we grant to all the truly penitent co-
</p>
<p>operators in this society, who shall confess their
</p>
<p>sins, and partake of the feast of the Lord's body
</p>
<p>on the day on which they shall be received into
</p>
<p>the society, full indulgence and remission of all
</p>
<p>their sins. Also, we grant full indulgence to
</p>
<p>them after they shall have been cleansed from
</p>
<p>the pollutions of life by holy confession, and re-

<p>188 APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>We shall first give a view of what the Leo-
</p>
<p>pold Foundation has done from its estal)lishment
</p>
<p>to the end of October, 1830 ; then will follow
</p>
<p>accoants from the missions. The institu-
</p>
<p>tion went into operation on the 13th of May,
</p>
<p>1829. The constitution, and the addresses de-
</p>
<p>livered on the day of its establishment, were
</p>
<p>translated into the different languages of our
</p>
<p>monarchy, and sent in great numbers to the
</p>
<p>various dioceses, to give publicity to tlie un-
</p>
<p>dertaki[ig. In Vienna, an office was opened,
</p>
<p>which was given to tlie society free of rent by
</p>
<p>the Prior of the Dominicans. The result soon
</p>
<p>appeared in contributions from all quarters to
</p>
<p>the central treasury, exhibiting a hvely proof
</p>
<p>of the zeal and efi'orts of priests and people to
</p>
<p>advance the kinsrdom God on earth. Before
</p>
<p>giving a statement of the receipts and expendi-
</p>
<p>tures, we cannot withhold the letter which the
</p>
<p>pious bishop of Cincinnati, in North America,
</p>
<p>Mr. Edward Fenwick  (whose Vicar- General,
</p>
<p>Frederick Rese, as is known to you all, by his
</p>
<p>visit to Vienna, gave occasion to the formation
</p>
