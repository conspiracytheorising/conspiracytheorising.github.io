<p>BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH
</p>
<p>or
</p>
<p>BIOMBROTI.
</p>
<p>The author of this work, Phillippo Buonarroti, was
</p>
<p>born in Florence in 1760. He was of noble extraction,
</p>
<p>and descended, it is said, in a right line from the cele
</p>
<p>brated Michael Angelo ; but, as Michael Angelo was
</p>
<p>never married, it is more probable that he belonged to a
</p>
<p>collateral branch of that family. Certain it is, at all
</p>
<p>events, that his immediate connexions were amongst the
</p>
<p>highest Order at Florence ; a fact not only attested by
</p>
<p>the high favour in which he was held in early life at the
</p>
<p>court of the Grand Duke Leopold, but also by the
</p>
<p>powerful influences he was enabled to interest in his
</p>
<p>behalf, at several critical periods of his subsequent life.
</p>
<p>He received his education at the University of Pisa,
</p>
<p>where he discovered great energy of mind, and an in
</p>
<p>defatigable zeal for study. He addicted himself in par
</p>
<p>ticular to the cultivation of philosophy, politics, and
</p>
<p>history. He also exhibited favourable specimens of his
</p>
<p>talents by several dissertations and essays on a variety
</p>
<p>of subjects.
</p>
<p>These promising dispositions, united with the great
</p>
<p>name he bore, won him the esteem of the Grand Duke
</p>
<p>Leopold, who made it a point to favour all the de
</p>
<p>scendants of the illustrious men of Florence, and espe
</p>
<p>cially the families of Buonarroti, Vespucci, and Galilei,
</p>
<p>whose ancestors had shed so much honour upon that
</p>
<p>nursery of Italian genius.
</p>
<p>As soon as Buonarroti quitted the University, the
</p>
<p>Grand Duke created him a Knight of the Order of St.
</p>
<p>Stephen, and offered him a distinguished place in his
</p>
<p>Court, with a large pension. The Order of Knighthood
</p>
<p>he aceepted ; but, whether from a desire to be more free

<p>IV BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF BUONARROTI.
</p>
<p>to prosecute his studies, or, what is more probable, from
</p>
<p>a hatred of the servilities and hypocrisy necessary to
</p>
<p>make a good courtier, be declined the latter offer.
</p>
<p>" The desire of enriching himself," observes one of his
</p>
<p>Tory biographers, " seems never to have possessed him ;
</p>
<p>his errors were of a very different character." Unfor
</p>
<p>tunately for Buonarroti's own prospects, they were indeed
</p>
<p>of a very different character ; for if to unite, to a thorough
</p>
<p>. knowledge of the causes of human misery, an ardent love
</p>
<p>of his fellow-creatures, and a burning desire to rescue
</p>
<p>them from tyranny and slavery, at the risk of every per
</p>
<p>sonal sacrifice and danger  be an error, no man was
</p>
<p>ever more deeply involved in error than Buonarroti. His
</p>
<p>life was a continued error of this kind. Hence the many
</p>
<p>difficulties and perils of his revolutionary career ; hence his
</p>
<p>participation in Babeuf's " Conspiracy for Equality;" and
</p>
<p>hence is now devolved on the writer of this the task of
</p>
<p>aiding to transmit this last monument of his patriotism
</p>
<p>and glory to the admiration, we trust, of the good and
</p>
<p>the oppressed of all nations.
</p>
<p>When the French Revolution broke out, it was natural
</p>
<p>that a mind constituted like Buonarroti's should catch
</p>
<p>the electric spark that thrilled all generous hearts with
</p>
<p>the hope of a new era. He accordingly entered into it
</p>
<p>with all the ardour of an Italian, and with an energy of
</p>
<p>character which showed that the soul of Michael Angelo
</p>
<p>was inherited by his illustrious descendant. Making no
</p>
<p>secret of his feelings, he boldly announced, and became
</p>
<p>a propagator of, the new principles. The Grand Duke
</p>
<p>was soon alarmed ; his predilections for Buonarroti as a
</p>
<p>man were lost in the terrors he iuspired as a politician.
</p>
<p>To the Duke's own fears were added those of his courtiers
</p>
<p>and ministers. Buonarroti was, of course, calumniated
</p>
<p>and defamed. He was accused of ingratitude, as though
</p>
<p>the Grand Duke had a right to his conscience, in return

</p>
<p>for the Order of Knighthood conferred on him ; and, by
</p>
<p>way of marking the Court's abhorrence of revolutionary
</p>
<p>principles, Buonarroti was exiled from Tuscany. From
</p>
<p>this period commenced at once his career of misfortune
</p>
<p>and glory.
</p>
<p>He first took refuge in Corsica with his wife and
</p>
<p>children, and soon after his arrival began to publish a
</p>
<p>BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF BUONARROTI. V
</p>
<p>patriotic journal, entitled, " L'Amico della Libertd
</p>
<p>Italica." (The Friend of Italian Libert;/.) This
</p>
<p>journal, which breathed the true spirit of a patriot, be
</p>
<p>sides attaching to him a host of admirers of the new
</p>
<p>principles, attracted the notice of Sahcetti the Deputy,
</p>
<p>to whom Buonarroti had been formerly known ; and the
</p>
<p>Constituent Assembly having finished its functions, and
</p>
<p>the Corsican Deputies being returned from Paris, Salicetti
</p>
<p>was rejoiced to find an old friend in his native country 
</p>
<p>a friend rendered doublv dear to him by his recent
</p>
<p>waitings and services in the popular cause.
</p>
<p>Not long after (in 1792) the second legislature was
</p>
<p>dissolved, and a National Convention summoned, to
</p>
<p>which Salicetti was elected by the Corsicans. Reluctant
</p>
<p>to leave so valuable a coadjutor behind, Salicetti pre
</p>
<p>vailed on Buonarroti to accompany him to Paris, where
</p>
<p>he would have a wider field for the exercise of his talents
</p>
<p>and labours in support of the Revolution. He accord
</p>
<p>ingly repaired thither, was received by the Republicans
</p>
<p>with the highest marks of esteem, and adopted into the
</p>
<p>famous popular society of the Friends of Liberty,
</p>
<p>better known under the name of the " Jacobin Club."
</p>
<p>In this situation he became acquainted with all the great
</p>
<p>leaders of the Mountain party, and it was probably from
</p>
<p>what he observed there, that he was subsequently en
</p>
<p>abled to distinguish so shrewdly between the generous
</p>
<p>and comprehensive policy of Robespierre's party, and
</p>
<p>the selfish and hollow character of those sham-Radical
</p>
<p>Mountainists, who then co-operated with Robespierre for
</p>
<p>their own ends, but who afterwards immolated him on
</p>
<p>the 9th Thermidor, after those ends had been attained.
</p>
<p>Some few months after the Convocation of the Na
</p>
<p>tional Convention (in the winter of 1792), an aristocratic
</p>
<p>insurrection broke out in Corsica, and it being necessary
</p>
<p>to send a Commissioner there with full powers, the choice

</p>
<p>fell on Buonarroti, who possessed all the personal and
</p>
<p>local requisites for the mission. Having repaired to
</p>
<p>that island he made every possible exertion to restore
</p>
<p>order, but being badly supported by the people, who had
</p>
<p>been seduced by the Royalists, he not only proved un
</p>
<p>successful,, but well nigh lost his life as well. The
</p>
<p>Corsican Aristocrats resolved to throw off their al-
</p>
<p>VI BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF BUONARROTI.
</p>
<p>legiance to France, and, like all Aristocrats, unscrupulous
</p>
<p>as to means, formed a conspiracy to assassinate Buonar
</p>
<p>roti. His house was surrounded in the dead of night,
</p>
<p>and it was only by throwing himself out of a window,
</p>
<p>amidst a discharge of pistols, that he escaped the
</p>
<p>hands of the assassins.
</p>
<p>Having with some difficulty effected his escape from
</p>
<p>Corsica, he returned to Paris, and from his known zeal
</p>
<p>and energy was immediately entrusted with a new and
</p>
<p>more dangerous mission. It was to suppress a counter
</p>
<p>revolutionary movement in Lyons, which the rich manu
</p>
<p>facturers and shopocrats of that town were industriously
</p>
<p>organising against the authorities of the Convention, and
</p>
<p>which threatened every moment to assume the character
</p>
<p>of a rebellion. These vampires, whose colossal wealth
</p>
<p>was derived from the luxurious spendings of the old
</p>
<p>aristocracy on the one hand, and from the brutalization
</p>
<p>of the workpeople on the other, were alarmed at the
</p>
<p>progress of Robespierre's doctrines of equality. To
</p>
<p>emancipate France was to strip them of the means of
</p>
<p>robbing their neighbours ; and seeing no security for the
</p>
<p>old system of monopoly and plunder, except in the re-
</p>
<p>establishment of Monarchy, they were all but in a
</p>
<p>state of insurrection before Buonarroti quitted Paris.
</p>
<p>The latter and Maillot, another active patriot, were
</p>
<p>armed with full powers to quell the insurrectionary spirit.
</p>
<p>This they hoped to effect tranquilly, and by the aid of
</p>
<p>the municipal body of Lyons, which had been revolu-
</p>
<p>tionarily organised ; but they had scarcely made half
</p>
<p>their journey when the dread tidings reached them that
</p>
<p>the town was in actual rebellion against the Convention ;
</p>
<p>that the municipal authorities had been deposed, and
</p>
<p>many of them massacred, by the insurgent shopocrats ;
</p>
<p>and that Challier, the famous Radical mayor (called a
</p>
<p>"fanatic" on account of his zeal and sincerity), had

</p>
<p>been judicially assassinated. The same fate was de
</p>
<p>signed for Buonarroti and Maillot, but this did not
</p>
<p>deter those brave patriots from proceeding on their
</p>
<p>mission. As soon as they reached the insurgent city,
</p>
<p>they were arrested, and carried before the president of
</p>
<p>the rebellious sections, whence they were sent to a dun
</p>
<p>geon, preparatory to their undergoing the fate of Challier.
</p>
<p>BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF BUONARROTI. Vll
</p>
<p>But on the eve of the day appointed for their execution,
</p>
<p>Collot d'Herbois arrived, and the Republican army en
</p>
<p>tering the place under his instructions, Buonarroti and
</p>
<p>his colleague were saved.
</p>
<p>It is said that having thus for a second time es
</p>
<p>caped assassination, Buonarroti expressed a wish for
</p>
<p>an appointment to some more peaceable situation ; but
</p>
<p>(as is justly observed by one of his commentators)
</p>
<p>" such a wish is not likely to have been formed by
</p>
<p>Buonarroti, than whom no man was ever less disposed
</p>
<p>to seek peace, and ensue it," to the neglect of his
</p>
<p>country's claims on his services. Be that as it may,
</p>
<p>Collot recommended him to his colleagues, Ricord and
</p>
<p>Robespierre's brother, who were then on a mission at
</p>
<p>Nice, and by them he was appointed a member of the
</p>
<p>military tribunal of the army of Italy; and after the
</p>
<p>conquest of Piedmont in the following year, agent of the
</p>
<p>Republic in all the conquered countries.
</p>
<p>It was in this last capacity that Buonarroti's real
</p>
<p>generosity of character became a theme of admiration
</p>
<p>for all who knew him. " He exhibited," says his bio
</p>
<p>grapher, " a degree of justice and disinterestedness,
</p>
<p>" which acquired him great celebrity in the eyes both of
</p>
<p>" French and Italians. Although at the head of an im-
</p>
<p>" mense administration, he not only proved himself
</p>
<p>" inaccessible to bribery and peculation, but actually
</p>
<p>" expended the produce of all his appointments in
</p>
<p>" relieving and succouring patriots and soldiers, who
</p>
<p>" hazarded their lives for their country. Being asked
</p>
<p>" why he preferred poverty to affluence; he replied, that
</p>
<p>" his only motive in coming to France was to be
</p>
<p>" serviceable to the cause of liberty, and that if he had
</p>
<p>" preferred riches he would not have left his prosperous
</p>
<p>" situation in Florence." *

</p>
<p>revolutionary agents acted with the like disinterestedness ;
</p>
<p>but, unfortunately, the majority of them considered the
</p>
<p>Revolution as a game of hazard, in which each had a
</p>
<p>right to grasp for himself whatever fortune offered. The
</p>
<p>pro-consuls and commissioners of the then Government

</p>
<p>French Revolution, &c. &c.

</p>
<p>were, with few exceptions, of this class. The system of
</p>
<p>terror which Robespierre and his friends had adopted
</p>
<p>and supported only as a safeguard against aristocrats
</p>
<p>and traitors, was converted by these monsters into a
</p>
<p>means of omnigenous robbery and self-aggrandisement.
</p>
<p>Hence the horrid butcheries in the provinces organised
</p>
<p>and perpetrated by Fouche, Tallien, Bourdon, Freron,
</p>
<p>Barras, and other brigand deputies and commissioners
</p>
<p>of the Convention. Sprung from the lowest dregs
</p>
<p>of society, a Revolution was necessary to push these
</p>
<p>adventurers into affluence ; but that once attained, a
</p>
<p>counter-revolution was required to secure them in the
</p>
<p>sate enjoyment of their blood-stained acquisitions.
</p>
<p>Hence, and from other causes not necessary here to par
</p>
<p>ticularize, arose the catastrophe of the 9th Thermidor ;
</p>
<p>or, in other words, the immolation of Robespierre and
</p>
<p>the sincere Republicans, by the brigand-Mountainists of
</p>
<p>the Convention, acting in conceit with the other aris
</p>
<p>tocratic factions of that assembly.
</p>
<p>This event, which changed the whole face of the Re
</p>
<p>public, occured whilst Buonarroti held the appointment
</p>
<p>of agent-general of all the conquered countries. The
</p>
<p>Revolution, which had hitherto progressed towards a
</p>
<p>new social order, to be based on equality of rights and
</p>
<p>general happiness, assumed a new character. The new
</p>
<p>Aristocrats, forming a junction with the old, rapacitv
</p>
<p>and proscription of the patriots became the order of the
</p>
<p>day. The friends of virtue and equality were every
</p>
<p>where devoted to destruction. Buonarroti was not tor-
</p>
<p>gotten. The Thermidorian assassins, aware of his
</p>
<p>principles and inflexible character, immediately dis
</p>
<p>patched orders for arresting him and sending him to
</p>
<p>Paris. Tureau, the representative at Nice, to whom
</p>
<p>these orders were addressed, having the highest personal
</p>
<p>esteem for Buonarroti, and wishing to give him an op

</p>
<p>portunity of escape, exclaimed publicly, " Voila encore
</p>
<p>une victime du Freronisme" (Behold another victim of
</p>
<p>Freronism).* He even delayed executing the commands
</p>
<p>of the Committee for ten days, so that Buonarroti was
</p>
<p>not only apprised of the fate intended for him, but might

</p>
<p>depart in safety if he wished. His secretary implored
</p>
<p>him to escape, and to provide against the future by
</p>
<p>carrying off the chest of the administration, which con
</p>
<p>tained about 300,000 livres. Buonarroti, indignant at
</p>
<p>this advice, replied with firmness, " Why should I leave
</p>
<p>so base a stain upon my character * Have I been
</p>
<p>guilty of any crime ? No  / yield to my destiny
</p>
<p>and consent to go to prison ! ! "
</p>
<p>Buonarroti was accordingly seized by the gendarmerie,
</p>
<p>and carried to Paris. In the prison Du Plessis, where
</p>
<p>lie was immured, " he suffered," says his biographer,
</p>
<p>" the greatest distress, and endeavoured to earn a sub
</p>
<p>sistence by teaching music." " I find," said he, " that
</p>
<p>Rousseau was altogether right when he recommended
</p>

<p>recourse to it for my subsistence."
</p>
<p>Two circumstances occurred during his imprisonment
</p>
<p>at Du Plessis, both strikingly illustrative of the true mag
</p>
<p>nanimity of his character. The National Convention,
</p>
<p>by whose orders he was arrested, came, by a just retri
</p>
<p>bution of Providence, to feel the effects of the counter-
</p>
<p>Revolution it had commenced. The middle classes of
</p>
<p>Paris, who desired a more complete re-action in their
</p>
<p>favour than the Convention was disposed to promote,
</p>
<p>rose in insurrection against it on the memorable 13th
</p>
<p>Vendemiaire. This movement, which was decidedly
</p>
<p>Royalist, filled the Convention, and the Thermidorians
</p>
<p>in particular, with alarm and dismay. Buonarroti being
</p>
<p>asked whether he did not rejoice to see the Convention
</p>
<p>menaced by the same Royalists whom the Thermidorian
</p>
<p>faction had so basely caressed, in order to secure their
</p>
<p>co-operation against Robespierre ? He generously made

</p>

</p>
<p>have experienced the grossest injustice at its hands."
</p>
<p>The other trait I alluded to is this : During Buonar
</p>
<p>roti's confinement, the Prince Corsini, ambassador from
</p>
<p>X BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF BUONARROTI.
</p>
<p>the Grand Duke of Tuscany, intimated to him that he
</p>
<p>would intercede with the Directory, and procure him
</p>
<p>his liberty, if he would engage to return to Florence, and
</p>
<p>resume there his rank and family honours. Buonarroti
</p>
<p>replied that he had relinquished his right for ever in
</p>
<p>Italy, that he was wedded to liberty, and that death or
</p>
<p>force alone should prevent him from remaining in France
</p>
<p>to enjoy the " vestigia morientis libertatis " (the last
</p>
<p>traces or remains of expiring liberty !) Such sublime
</p>
<p>devotedness was not without its reward even in Direc
</p>
<p>torial France. A few days afterwards the Convention
</p>
<p>(feeling itself to be in more danger from the Royalists
</p>
<p>than from the Democrats, and desiring to use the latter
</p>
<p>as a sort of counterpoise to the growing ascendancy of
</p>
<p>the former), proclaimed a general amnesty to all the
</p>
<p>confined patriots, and Buonarroti regained his liberty
</p>
<p>once more. This, which was his third escape, was
</p>
<p>(considering the then state of parties) almost as mar
</p>
<p>vellous as either of his two former ones. It was only
</p>
<p>the hope that his life would prove more useful than his
</p>
<p>death to the then dominant faction, that saved him on
</p>
<p>this occasion from adding one more to the numerous
</p>
<p>victims of the Thermidorian counter-Revolution.
</p>
<p>From this period we hear no more of Buonarroti till
</p>
<p>he connected himself with the Pantheonists, and in con
</p>
<p>junction with Babeuf and others, organised the famous
</p>
<p>conspiracy for equality which forms the subject of this
</p>
<p>work. But of these events he must be his own historian.
</p>
<p>One circumstance, however, in this part of his eventful
</p>
<p>career I cannot forbear noticing here. It stamps the
</p>
<p>seal of conviction on all that is recorded in commendation
</p>
<p>of " this magnanimous and accomplished character 
</p>
<p>the gallant but unfortunate Buonarroti," as he is justly
</p>
<p>designated by one of his biographers. I allude to the
</p>
<p>dialogue which took place between him and the President

</p>
<p>of the Military Commission appointed to try him for the
</p>
<p>conspiracy : 
</p>
<p>" Did you conspire ?" said the President.
</p>
<p>" Yes," answered Buonarroti.
</p>
<p>" What motive induced you to conspire ?"
</p>
<p>" The love of mankind."
</p>
<p>" What were the principles that directed you ?"

</p>
<p>" The rights of man."
</p>
<p>" But did you intend to overthrow the present Con-
</p>
<p>" stitution ?"
</p>
<p>" Yes ! and till I cease to live I will ever conspire
</p>
<p>" against tyrants. Was it worthwhile to shed the blood
</p>
<p>" of two millions of citizens, in order to restore slavery
</p>
<p>" again ? Was it worth while to crush the ci-devant, in
</p>
<p>" order to bow to the ci-apres ?"
</p>
<p>" But are you not a foreigner ?"
</p>
<p>" No man is an alien to the cause of human nature."
</p>
<p>It will be seen from the sequel that only two of the
</p>
<p>conspirators were condemned to death  Darthe and
</p>
<p>Babeuf; the former, most probably, because he was the
</p>
<p>intimate friend of Robespierre ; and Babeuf, I should
</p>
<p>suppose, in consequence of the inflexible perseverance
</p>
<p>with which he preached and advocated in his journal a
</p>
<p>" community of property. " This doctrine was particularly
</p>
<p>unpalatable to the then rulers of France, who were all up
</p>
<p>start adventurers, enriched by public plunder, and reeking
</p>
<p>with the blood and spoils of the Revolution. The rest
</p>
<p>of the conspirators, including Buonarroti, were only sen
</p>
<p>tenced to transportation ; but this apparent clemency to
</p>
<p>parties equally culpable as Babeuf and Darthe, is easily
</p>
<p>accounted for. The Quarterly Review explains it well.
</p>
<p>" They who were then in authority," observes that pe
</p>
<p>riodical, " had good reason for this. The appetite of
</p>
<p>the Revolution for blood, which during a long and
</p>
<p>dreadful time had ' grown by what it fed on,' had gained
</p>
<p>their ends in the Revolution, and, therefore, wished it
</p>
<p>to stop where it was ; and they were conscious, moreover,
</p>
<p>that against them Babeuf and his associates had but
</p>
<p>too strong a case."
</p>
<p>Buonarroti's sentence, it appears, was never carried
</p>
<p>into effect, owing, it is supposed, to the reiterated inter
</p>
<p>cession of the Court of Tuscany. Incarceration vvas sub

<p>stituted for transportation, and he was confined first at
</p>
<p>Cherbourg, then at some place in the Maritime Alps,
</p>
<p>where he was as late as 1806, and lastly in some other
</p>
<p>remote extremity of France, the name of which is not
</p>
<p>stated. The last account I heard of Buonarroti was
</p>
<p>shortly after the Revolution of 1830, when it seems he
</p>
<p>was arrested by some of Louis Philippe's agents. The
</p>
<p>Xli BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF BUONARROTI.
</p>
<p>Times newspaper, which was then " on the Liberal side,
</p>
<p>noticed the matter in the way of indignant remonstrance.
</p>
<p>It upbraided Louis Philippe for cruelty in persecuting so
</p>
<p>venerable and (as the > Times then thought him) so
</p>
<p>patriotic an old man. (Buonarroti must have been then
</p>
<p>upwards of 70.) Such an eulogium, upon such a man,
</p>
<p>it did certainly surprise me at the time to find in such a
</p>
<p>publication ; nor was my surprise without good cause, as
</p>
<p>the honest Times itself soon proved ; for, in a day or
</p>
<p>two after, out comes another leader in the Times, dis
</p>
<p>claiming all it said before, and pointing attention to some
</p>
<p>correspondent's letter, in which Buonarroti was abused
</p>
<p>as a leveller, and calumniated as a blood-thirsty follower
</p>
<p>of Robespierre. The humane and liberty-loving Times
</p>
<p>was, of course, shocked at this disclosure ; and, though
</p>
<p>poor Buonarroti had done nothing in the mean time to
</p>
<p>excite our contemporary's wrath, all the praises and
</p>
<p>appeals to the French authorities in his behalf were re
</p>
<p>tracted, and the " venerable and patriotic old man " was
</p>
<p>left to sink or swim, as he best could, under the tutelary
</p>
<p>protection of honest Louis Philippe. So much for
</p>
<p>Printing-house-square philanthropy.
</p>
<p>What has since become of Buonarroti,  whether he is
</p>
<p>alive or dead, I have not heard. Should any of my
</p>
<p>readers be able to give me any information on the sub
</p>
<p>ject, I shall be most happy to publish it at the close of

<p>BRO.NTERRE.
</p>
<p>TO THE READER.
</p>
<p>My readers mav desire to know my reasons for pub
</p>
<p>lishing Buonarroti's work. I will frankly explain. The
</p>
<p>motives that determined me are as follows : 
</p>
<p>1st. Because Buonarroti's book contains one of the
</p>
<p>best expositions I have seen of those great political and
</p>
<p>social principles which I have so long advocated in the
</p>
<p>" Poor Man's Guardian" and other publications, and
</p>
<p>which I am still endeavouring to inculcate through the
</p>
<p>columns of " Hetheringtons Twopenny Dispatch."
</p>
<p>The application of these principles I deem to be of
</p>
<p>paramount importance to the human race. Society has
</p>
<p>been hitherto constituted upon no fixed principles. The
</p>
<p>state in which we find it is the blind result of chance.
</p>
<p>Even its advocates do not claim for it any other origin.
</p>
<p>The right of the strongest  the only right acknowledged
</p>
<p>by savage man appears to be still the fundamental
</p>
<p>charter of all " civilized " states. The wandering savage
</p>
<p>asks no other title to his neighbour's produce than his own
</p>
<p>superior strength or capacity to take it. The " civilized''
</p>
<p>man acts precisely, though disguisedly, on the same prin
</p>
<p>ciple. Then- means are different, but the objects and
</p>
<p>end are the same. What the savage or uncivilized man
</p>
<p>does individually and directly, by the exercise of mere
</p>
<p>personal prowess, the civilized man (so called) does col
</p>
<p>lectively and circuitously , by cunningly-designed in
</p>
<p>stitutions. Theeffectsof these institutions are well depicted
</p>
<p>by Buonarroti. He shows, with admirable ability, how,
</p>
<p>in trying to escape the evils of savage life, man has un
</p>
<p>consciously plunged into another state far more cala
</p>
<p>mitous  to wit, the present artificial state, which he
</p>
<p>terms that of " false civilization." He shows, that to
</p>
<p>correct the evils of this latter state, without at the same
</p>
<p>time retrograding to the former, was the grand problem
</p>
<p>sought to be resolved by the first French Revolution ;
</p>
<p>and, in discussing the principles and institutions deemed

</p>
<p>necessaty to that end by the leaders of the Revolution,
</p>
<p>Xiv TO THE READER.
</p>
<p>I was so forcibly struck by the coincidence of Buonarroti's
</p>
<p>ideas with my own, that I immediately resolved to trans
</p>
<p>late the book, and thereby present to the English reader
</p>
<p>the doctrines of the " Poor Mans Guardian" under a
</p>
<p>new form and dress, which, if I mistake not, will add
</p>
<p>greatly to their popularity, in consequence of the superior
</p>
<p>abilities and practical experience of the author. Such,
</p>
<p>then, is my first and chief motive in sending forth this
</p>
<p>work. 2d. Because it contains what to me appears the most
</p>
<p>luminous and correct estimate, to be found in any lan
</p>
<p>guage, of the leading men and events of the great
</p>
<p>French Revolution. In this respect I deem the repub
</p>
<p>lication of Buonarroti's work an imperative duty.
</p>
<p>In no other book have I seen the frauds of history so
</p>
<p>effectually exposed. It is impossible to read it without
</p>
<p>being convinced that nearly all the books that have ap
</p>
<p>peared on the French Revolution are masses of fabrica
</p>
<p>tion and misrepresentation, artfully designed to reconcile
</p>
<p>mankind to aristocratic tyranny. To believe these im
</p>
<p>postors, one would suppose that the Royalists and
</p>
<p>Girondists included all the public virtue in France at
</p>
<p>that epoch, and that Robespierre and his party were a
</p>
<p>band of illiterate and blood-thirsty monsters, who, under
</p>
<p>pretence of serving the public, sought only to aggrandize
</p>
<p>themselves, and who, to gain their selfish and criminal
</p>
<p>ends, would cover France with scaffolds and dead bodies.
</p>
<p>How different the reality ! How utterly at variance with
</p>
<p>facts and reason are these representations! The then
</p>
<p>Royalists of France were exactly the same description of
</p>
<p>persons that now support Louis Philippe's despotism ; that
</p>
<p>is to say, Aristocrats and rich usurers, who, caring only
</p>
<p>for themselves, would sacrifice half the human race to
</p>
<p>make slaves and brutes of the other half. The Girond
</p>
<p>ists consisted of lawyers, bankers, and babbling literati,
</p>
<p>who, jealous of the nobility and privileged orders, sought

</p>
<p>to swindle the Government, and all the advantages de
</p>
<p>rivable from it, into their own hands. Some good men
</p>
<p>there were, no doubt, amongst them ; but, taken as a
</p>
<p>whole, the Girondists were the worst faction in France,
</p>
<p>except perhaps the sham-Radical portion of the Moun
</p>
<p>tain party, that conspired with the committees of
</p>
<p>TO THE READER. XT
</p>
<p>Government to destroy Robespierre. The Royalists
</p>
<p>would concentre the whole national authority in the
</p>
<p>hands of the rich bourgeoisie, or make it absolute in the
</p>
<p>King and Council. The Girondists would extend the
</p>
<p>franchise to the small middlemen (just as our English
</p>
<p>Whigs did by the Reform Bill), in order the more effec
</p>
<p>tually to keep down the working classes. The one
</p>
<p>would govern by the Church and a standing army; the
</p>
<p>other would govern by money, by lying journalism, and
</p>
<p>an armed shopocracy. Priestcraft and bayonets were
</p>
<p>the materiel of Royalist tyranny ; Mammon and corrupt
</p>
<p>literature were the weapons of the other. The prevailing
</p>
<p>characteristics of the Royalists were sloth, monopoly,
</p>
<p>bigotry, hatred of change; those of the Girondists were
</p>
<p>restlessness, intrigue, falsehood, and cowardly ambition.
</p>
<p>The sham-Radical Mountainists differed from both in
</p>
<p>this  that wanting the riches of the former party, and
</p>
<p>the talents of the Girondists, they were obliged to make
</p>
<p>up for the double deficiency by brigand courage and
</p>
<p>enterprize. To this latter party belonged the Septem-
</p>
<p>brizers  the chief terrorists of the Convention  and the
</p>
<p>ferocious pro-consuls and commissioners who shed so
</p>
<p>much blood in the provinces. Its leaders were Bourdon,
</p>
<p>Tallien, Fouche, Freron, Legendre; Barras and Ro-
</p>
<p>vere also belonged to it; but previously to Danton's
</p>
<p>death, that demagogue was considered the chief of the
</p>
<p>party. In the early stages of the Revolution, and, in
</p>
<p>deed, till a short period before his death, the necessity
</p>
<p>of opposing a strong force to the Royalists and Girond
</p>
<p>ists, obliged Robespierre to act with these desperadoes,
</p>
<p>but there was no mutuality or congeniality of feeling be
</p>
<p>tween him and them. Robespierre and his friends de
</p>
<p>sired to turn the Revolution to the account of humanity,
</p>
<p>by introducing a new social order into society, based on
</p>
<p>equality of rights and purity of morals. The Dantonists,

</p>
<p>on the other hand, cared nothing about rights or morals,
</p>
<p>provided they could acquire riches and power for them
</p>
<p>selves. The Revolution was in their eyes a game of
</p>
<p>hazard, in which every one had a right to seize all he
</p>
<p>could for himself, no matter at what cost or at whose
</p>
<p>expense. Such discordant elements could not long
</p>
<p>coalesce. Previously to the 1st of May, 1793, the
</p>
<p>Xvi TO THE READER.
</p>
<p>necessity of combatting the Girondists, who had then a
</p>
<p>majority in the Convention, kept them united, but after
</p>
<p>that event the chasm became wider and wider every day.
</p>
<p>The Dantonists, who had combatted the Royalists and
</p>
<p>the Girondists, only with a view to succeed them in
</p>
<p>authority, formed the nucleus of a new Aristocracy ; but
</p>
<p>having acquired their ascendancy solely by the people's
</p>
<p>favour, they found it convenient still to profess popular
</p>
<p>principles; 'conscious, however, that Robespierre knew
</p>
<p>their real designs, and dreading his extreme popularity,
</p>
<p>and still more his inflexible integrity, they naturally de
</p>
<p>sired his downfall. Moreover, as Robespierre combatted
</p>
<p>against principles, not men, they felt that the same
</p>
<p>patriotic motives which had impelled him against the
</p>
<p>Royalists and the Girondists, would necessarily compel
</p>
<p>him at last to take a part against themselves, seeing that
</p>
<p>they had now usurped the places of the Aristocracy, to
</p>
<p>whose vices they added those also of brigandism and
</p>
<p>apostacy. These considerations necessarily hastened
</p>
<p>the shock of parties.
</p>
<p>The result is well told by Buonarroti. Suffice it to
</p>
<p>observe here, that Robespierre was overwhelmed on the
</p>
<p>9th Thermidor (27 July, 1794), by a conspiracy of all
</p>
<p>the factions in the Convention, headed by the Despera
</p>
<p>does or Dantonists just described. His accusation was
</p>
<p>decreed with acclamations, amid cries of " Down with
</p>
<p>the tyrant ;" and after his execution he was, of course,
</p>
<p>saddled with the chief share of all the crimes of the
</p>
<p>Revolution, and especially with those that had been
</p>
<p>committed by his assassins. This is the way in all Revo
</p>
<p>lutions. The dominant party takes credit to itself for
</p>
<p>all that is good, and flings upon the vanquished the
</p>
<p>odium of all that is bad.
</p>
<p>As a proof how little reliance can be placed in history,
</p>
<p>I shall just notice here some of the opinions promulgated

<p>respecting Robespierre. Mark their inconsistency with
</p>
<p>facts, and with one another.
</p>
<p>M. Dulaure, in the course of a long article inserted
</p>
<p>in the Censeur of 1815, proves (as he thinks) that
</p>
<p>Robespierre was a secret Royalist traitor, who had sold
</p>
<p>himself first to Orleans, and afterwards to the foreign
</p>
<p>enemy, for gold. Dulaure asserts, that beyond doubt
</p>
<p>TO THE READER. XVII
</p>
<p>Robespierre received bribes from foreign Courts ; and that
</p>
<p>previously to his death he was meditating how to smooth
</p>
<p>the way for the return of royalty in the person of Louis
</p>
<p>XVIII. A strange character this, to give of a man whom
</p>
<p>France called the Incorruptible, from his well-known
</p>
<p>contempt of riches  a man of whom Napoleon said that
</p>
<p>if he had been offered 2,000,000f. to betray the Repub
</p>
<p>lic, he would have rejected it with disdain  of a man, in
</p>
<p>short, who, though the most influential in France during
</p>
<p>a period of eighteen months, and consequently with un
</p>
<p>bounded opportunities of enriching himself, nevertheless
</p>
<p>died so poor that the sale of all his effects after his death
</p>
<p>fetched only 240 livres, or less than 10Z. !
</p>
<p>Another character of Robespierre is, that he " was of
</p>
<p>a cold, sanguinary disposition, without conviction and
</p>
<p>without conscience  ready to exterminate three-fourths
</p>
<p>of the French people  devoid of all capacity, and aspi
</p>
<p>ring to some inexplicable sort of bloody dictatorship,"
</p>
<p>&c. Such is the sapient opinion of Fantin Desodoards,
</p>
<p>author of a history on the French Revolution. Dulaure
</p>
<p>and he would be not a little puzzled to reconcile these
</p>
<p>two characters. It would non-plus them to explain how
</p>
<p>a man, aspiring to a dictatorship for himself, could at the
</p>
<p>same time be plotting for the royalty of another. Beth
</p>
<p>these writers, by the way, represent Robespierre as an
</p>
<p>unparalleled liar and hypocrite, &c. &c.
</p>
<p>Now, what say Messrs. Thiers and Mignet ? According
</p>
<p>to these worthies, Robespierre was " an honest fanatic (un
</p>
<p>fanatique de bonne foi), of mediocre capacity, devoured
</p>
<p>w ith envy and pride, incapable of courage ; for the rest,
</p>
<p>a sincere and incorruptible Republican, but beneath the
</p>
<p>mission which he supposed himself called to fill," &c. &c.
</p>
<p>It would be a nice matter to reconcile this, with the two
</p>
<p>preceding characters. The honest fanatic does not har
</p>
<p>monise well with the profound hypocrite " without con

</p>
<p>Another writer, named Nodier, has improved on Thiers
</p>
<p>and Mignet. According to him, Robespierre was net
</p>
<p>only honest, but horribly honest ! His expression is " kor-

</p>
<p>rible bonne foi." " From these circumstances," ob
</p>
<p>serves Nodier, " I should consider Robespierre to be the
</p>
<p>true personification of the Revolution  his rare dis
</p>
<p>interestedness, his horrible honesty, and his appetite
</p>
<p>for blood!" What a jumble is here. Before I saw this
</p>
<p>profound criticism I was not aware that there was any
</p>
<p>thing horrible in honesty, much less did I imagine there
</p>
<p>was any natural connexion between blood-spilling and
</p>
<p>disinterestedness ; but historians are rare discoverers. If
</p>
<p>we believe the Abbe de Montgaillard, or the Conjuration
</p>
<p>de Robespierre (by Mountjoye), or Fantin Desodoard,
</p>
<p>Robespierre was a compound of all the inferior qualities,
</p>
<p>not only of human nature, but of brute and reptile na
</p>
<p>tures also. He was " ignorant, ugly, grim, sombre, ma
</p>
<p>lignant, vulgar, lascivious, brutal, envious, a hater of
</p>
<p>journalists, a second Omar against literature, a barbarous
</p>
<p>proscriber of the arts and sciences, a murderer of his
</p>
<p>enemies, an assassin of his friends, a bachelor only be
</p>
<p>cause the chastity of marriage did not suit his taste for
</p>
<p>libertinism, a seducer of his host's daughter, and, to
</p>
<p>complete the picture, a filthy beast that finished his daily
</p>
<p>orgies of lust and the guillotine by a nocturnal debauch
</p>
<p>%mongst common prostitutes ! ! !" Such is the character
</p>
<p>given by history of one of the noblest spirits that ever
</p>
<p>adorned human nature.
</p>
<p>History has been defined to be, " Philosophy teaching
</p>
<p>by examples." A just definition, no doubt, if applied
</p>
<p>to true history ; but how melancholy to think that the
</p>
<p>youth of a nation should have its opinions formed by
</p>
<p>such " philosophy" as that just quoted  a " philosophy"
</p>
<p>that has falsehood for its means, and slavery for its end!
</p>
<p>But what, you may ask, is the secret of this ferocity 
</p>
<p>of these unheard of calumnies against an individual ? Read

</p>
<p>But the counter-revolutionary conspiracy of the 9th
</p>
<p>Thermidor destroyed all. Robespierre and his friends
</p>
<p>removed, the few honest Democrats in the Convention
</p>
<p>were left without weight or influence. The old Aris
</p>
<p>tocrats uniting themselves to the new, that assembly
</p>
<p>soon became thoroughly anti-popular. Deprived of
</p>
<p>their party in the Convention, the friends of equality
</p>
<p>were soon driven from all their strongholds. The very
</p>
<p>day after Robespierre's death they lost the Commune, or
</p>
<p>Municipal Authority of Paris, which was broken up by
</p>
<p>order of the Convention, and never afterwards re-orga
</p>
<p>nised. They were next driven from the Committees of
</p>
<p>Government. The sectional meetings, which in Robes
</p>
<p>pierre's time used to be held every day, were now re
</p>
<p>duced to one in every decade, or ten days; and the
</p>
<p>daily payment of forty sous to the sansculottes, to enable
</p>
<p>them to attend, was discontinued. As democracy declined
</p>
<p>in influence, the bourgeoisie and the Royalists raised their
</p>
<p>heads once more. The population of Paris, finding itself
</p>
<p>betrayed and disappointed, made a few insurrections to
</p>
<p>recover its lost power ; but without chiefs, or a powerful
</p>
<p>Commune to lead, they proved feeble and abortive. To*
</p>
<p>complete its humiliation, and to cut off all hope as well as
</p>
<p>chance of future success, the Convention, under pretence
</p>
<p>of preparing organic laws for the execution of the Constitu
</p>
<p>tion of 1793, abolished that Constitution altogether, and
</p>
<p>substituted for itthe Constitution of the Year HI. (1795),
</p>
<p>which made over the legislature to the middle classes, by
</p>
<p>annexing a money qualification to the franchise. This
</p>
<p>was the final blow at the democracy. The people now
</p>
<p>became universally sensible of the real character and
</p>
<p>motives of the Thermidorian Revolution. The destruc

<p>new treason, which was to wrest the national sovereignty
</p>
<p>from the entire body of the citizens, in order that a single
</p>
<p>class might monopolize it. The Constitution of 1793 had
</p>
<p>been voted by 4,800,000 adult Frenchmen, exclusire of
</p>
<p>the armies, which were all devotedly attached to it. The
</p>
<p>Constitution of 1795, on the other hand, received but
</p>
<p>900,000 votes, and the armies were all against it. Yet,
</p>
<p>XX TO THE READER.
</p>
<p>because this latter established the Government of the
</p>
<p>middle class, the perfidious Convention was satisfied with
</p>
<p>the 900,000 votes, and took no account of the 4,800,000
</p>
<p>in favour of the popular and legitimate Constitution.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the history of the world does not record a more
</p>
<p>hideous treason than this. Had such a measure been
</p>
<p>proposed only two years before iii the Convention, the
</p>
<p>proposer would have been sent before the revolutionary
</p>
<p>tribunal as a traitor. But so great had been the reaction
</p>
<p>since Robespierre's death, that except in petitions and
</p>
<p>remonstrances, no resistance was offered by the people.
</p>
<p>The 900,000 shopocrats were quietly suffered to rob
</p>
<p>the 4,000,000 citizens of their rights and sovereignty;
</p>
<p>and there was no longer a power in the country to
</p>
<p>invade the Conventionalists in their hall, or to blow
</p>
<p>the swindling shopocracy to hell at the cannon's
</p>
<p>mouth. The people, deceived and disappointed, aban
</p>
<p>doned the struggle in despair. After all their sacri
</p>
<p>fices, they wondered to find themselves worse off
</p>
<p>than before the Revolution ; they had not know
</p>
<p>ledge enough to know that, of all governments, a
</p>
<p>government of the middle class is the most grinding and
</p>
<p>remorseless; if they had, they would have felt less sur
</p>
<p>mise at the dreadful distress at that time felt by the
</p>
<p>Parisian workmen. The Convention having suppressed
</p>
<p>the law of the maximum* in favour of the Shopocrats, as
</p>
<p>also those against monopolv and forestalling, the conse
</p>
<p>quence was that usury and high profits became the order
</p>
<p>of the day. To add to the difficulty, assignats, the only
</p>
<p>money accessible to the labouring class, were in discredit.
</p>
<p>This arose in a great measure from the extravagance
</p>
<p>and wasteful system of finance adopted bv the new Go
</p>
<p>vernment, which had issued no less than ,10,000 millions
</p>
<p>of assignats since the 9th Thermidor. The depreciation

<p>TO THE READER.
</p>
<p>parties agree that this was a period of unexampled
</p>
<p>distress, although the harvest had been singularly abun
</p>
<p>dant. The fact is acknowledged, but the cause is left
</p>
<p>to conjecture. The following, however, shows pretty
</p>
<p>clearly what the cause was : " Such," observes Mignet,
</p>
<p>" was the distressing situation of the country after the
</p>
<p>fall of the Committee of Public Safety, which had during
</p>
<p>its reign provided against scarcity, both in the army and
</p>
<p>the interior, by requisitions and the maximum. No
</p>
<p>person could escape this financial regulation by which
</p>
<p>the mercantile and the wealthy classes were rendered
</p>
<p>tributary to the soldiers and the mob. During that
</p>
<p>period, therefore, the necessaries of life were not neces
</p>
<p>sarily hoarded in warehouses. But since, when an end
</p>
<p>was put to violence and confiscation, the people, the
</p>
<p>Convention, and the armies had been at the mercy of
</p>
<p>proprietors and speculators; the consequence was, a
</p>
<p>frghtful degree of poverty, the reactiou of the maxi
</p>
<p>mum," &c. Mignet calls the requisitions and maximum
</p>
<p>violent, though they were absolutely necessary to support
</p>
<p>1,400,000 soldiers fighting in defence of the country on
</p>
<p>the frontiers ; but he does not call the hoarding by the
</p>
<p>vampire profit-hunters violent, although the effect of that
</p>
<p>was certain death, and torments the most excruciating, to
</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands. But so it is with aristocratic
</p>
<p>historians. The middleman's gains being of more con
</p>
<p>sequence in his eyes than the poor man's life, whatever
</p>
<p>interferes with the one is " violent," while the other is
</p>
<p>very lightly dealt with. Thus Mignet sums up for the
</p>
<p>poor, quietly  " they attributed their distress to the
</p>
<p>merchants, to the contractors, to the landholders, to
</p>
<p>the Government (all with good reason), and, they called

<p>to mind, not without regret, that not long ago they

<p>Such was the condition of France two years after the
</p>
<p>death of Robespierre, when the famous conspiracy of
</p>
<p>Babeuf was formed,  and this brings me to my third
</p>
<p>reason for publishing this book.
</p>
<p>3rd. Because " Babeuf 's Conspiracy for Equality"
</p>
<p>appears to me the only event of the kind recorded in
</p>
<p>history that was sincerely and comprehensively designed
</p>
<p>XXii TO THE READER.
</p>
<p>for the benefit of human kind. The only conspiracy to
</p>
<p>match it in magnitude of means, was that of Cataline to
</p>
<p>set fire to Rome during Cicero's consulship, but from
</p>
<p>what history has transmitted relative to that event (a
</p>
<p>good deal falsified no doubt) it does not appear that
</p>
<p>Cataline and his accomplices had any other motives than
</p>
<p>plunder and private revenge. Not that I believe what
</p>
<p>Sallust and Cicero relate respecting him. The fact that
</p>
<p>Cicero was obliged to put his accomplices to death un-
</p>
<p>condemned, is enough for me. Had not the conspiracy
</p>
<p>and its agents been more popular than it suited Sallust
</p>
<p>or Cicero to state, the latter would not have feared to
</p>
<p>send them for trial before the judges. Nevertheless ,
</p>
<p>putting the case most favourably for Cataline, there
</p>
<p>is no evidence extant to show that that conspirator
</p>
<p>was actuated by other than personal motives  motives
</p>
<p>it may be justifiable and provoked  but still only per
</p>
<p>sonal and vindictive.
</p>
<p>Of a very different character was the conspiracy of
</p>
<p>Babeuf and his friends. Their's was a plot for the eman
</p>
<p>cipation of France  for the regeneration and happiness
</p>
<p>of mankind. It was a conspiracy to restore the demo
</p>
<p>cratic Constitution of 1793, and, through that Constitu
</p>
<p>tion, the reign of political and social equality. Nor was
</p>
<p>the project a chimerical one. The conspirators had
</p>
<p>abundant means and materials for success. Never,
</p>
<p>perhaps, was a conspiracy conducted with better aus
</p>
<p>pices, or more likely to succeed, up to the moment when
</p>
<p>it was broken by the hand of perfidy. . The then state of
</p>
<p>France, and particularly Paris, was peculiarly favour
</p>
<p>able. The experience of two years had made the mul
</p>
<p>titude regret the loss of Robespierre's Government. The
</p>
<p>abundance enjoyed then, and the happy times that
</p>
<p>promised to follow the accomplishment of his projects for

</p>
<p>poor for extirpating mendicity and, above all, for
</p>
<p>putting the people in secure possession of the Constitu
</p>
<p>tion of 1793; these, and the like, contrasted strangely
</p>
<p>with the misery and impotence experienced by the mul
</p>
<p>titude under the new Government. Now, the object of
</p>
<p>the conspirators (who were all devoted admirers of
</p>
<p>TO THE READER. XXU1
</p>
<p>Robespierre) being to resume the great work left off on
</p>
<p>the 9th Thermidor, it was pretty certain that the mo
</p>
<p>ment they declared themselves, the multitude would rise
</p>
<p>as one man for them. Besides, the doctrines of social
</p>
<p>equality had been recently rendered so universally popu
</p>
<p>lar by Robespierre's Government, that they no longer
</p>
<p>inspired feelings of incredulity (as they might now in
</p>
<p>France), but rather of enthusiasm and confidence. The
</p>
<p>principles to which the people were invited to rally
</p>
<p>were the same that had often led them to victory, and
</p>
<p>to the achievement of such prodigies. Upon the
</p>
<p>people, then, the conspirators had every reason to
</p>
<p>calculate. Moreover, they had 17,000 practised Revo
</p>
<p>lutionists ready to act at a given signal. They had the
</p>
<p>Mountaineers* of the Convention with them, and the
</p>
<p>ex-officers of various kinds who had been in authority
</p>
<p>under Robespierre to the number of 1 ,500 ; they had
</p>
<p>the artillerymen of Paris, who were noted for their demo
</p>
<p>cratic spirit, the grenadiers of the legislative body, the
</p>
<p>whole corps of the Invalides, and almost the entire legion
</p>
<p>of police. They had also gained the guards, the ma
</p>
<p>gazines, and the artillery at the camp of Vincennes; and
</p>
<p>by Grisel, one of the conspirators (the same that after
</p>
<p>wards betrayed them), they were assured of the good
</p>
<p>dispositions of the soldiers at the camp of Grenelle. With
</p>
<p>the aid of the two camps they promised themselves a
</p>
<p>speedy success ; but should the troops hold out against
</p>
<p>the harangues of their orators, the blandishments of the
</p>
<p>women, who were to present them with garlands and
</p>
<p>refreshments, and the invitation of the Invalides to follow
</p>
<p>their example, preparations were made for barricading
</p>
<p>the streets against them, and showering upon them
</p>
<p>stones, slates, bricks, vitriol, and boiling water. But I

<p>anticipate the narrative  I have said so much only to

<p>XX1V TO THE READER.
</p>
<p>P.S. I had intended to offer some remarks as to the
</p>
<p>credibility of Buonarroti as a historian, but the following
</p>
<p>extracts are, I think, considering the quarter from whence
</p>
<p>they come, sufficiently decisive on that point. A good
</p>
<p>word from the Quarterly is  in Buonarroti's case at
</p>
<p>least (to use his own words)  omni exceptione major.
</p>
<p>(From the Quarterly Review.)
</p>
<p>"The work of Buonarroti may be considered not only as the
</p>
<p>most curious one which has appeared concerning the French Re
</p>
<p>volution, but as the most important also.1'
</p>
<p>Again  " Let us render justice both to Buonarroti and his work.
</p>
<p>That he was an accomplished person, and a man of great abilities,
</p>
<p>is beyond all doubt ; as little can it be doubted, that if his opinions
</p>
<p>had been compatible with the public welfare (Tory welfare he
</p>
<p>means), or if he had lived in peaceful times, he might in many
</p>
<p>respects have been an estimable and distinguished member of
</p>
<p>society. The estimation in which he was held at the Court of the
</p>
<p>Grand Duke, Leopold, is proof of this. To speak of him as intrepid,
</p>
<p>would be to use a word at once inadequate and inappropriate ; to
</p>
<p>use an expression of Marshal Soult, he was an impassable man ; he
</p>
<p>could have done whatever Sylla or Marius did ; whatever Timur
</p>
<p>or Nadir enjoined among barbarians, or Simon de Montford and
</p>
<p>Alva among persecuting Christians, he could have executed with

<p>out hesitation and without remorse, &c. &c. * * * * He
</p>
<p>has rendered an important service to society by the publication of

<p>these Memoirs. There never was a book more trustworthy in all

<p>i'ts statements," &c.
</p>
<p>Again  " On the subject of the conspiracy his authority is omni
</p>
<p>exceptions major ; he is perfectly explicit both as to the object at
</p>
<p>which he aimed and the means by which it was to be brought
</p>
<p>about; the object was to subvert the existing system, not of
</p>
<p>Government alone, but of society in France, and to introduce an
</p>
<p>absolute community of goods ; the means were, an insurrection

<p>Besides other duties, a long and rigorous detention,

<p>self to make known. Nevertheless, I might possibly
</p>
<p>have been able to publish this work much sooner, had I
</p>
<p>not been withheld by the apprehension of furnishing
</p>
<p>fresh pretexts for animosities and persecutions. Now,
</p>
<p>however, that age presses me, I have decided to let it
</p>
<p>appear ; and I feel the greater confidence in so doing,
</p>
<p>because, on the one hand, the men of that epoch have
</p>
<p>almost all disappeared, and because, on the other, the
</p>
<p>political doctrines of the present day being at an infinite
</p>
<p>distance from those which were professed by the De
</p>
<p>mocrats of the year IV of the French Republic, there
</p>
<p>exists no longer any occasion to dread any dangerous
</p>
<p>application. Besides, it is just that the democratic
</p>
<p>party should be at length known in its true colours.
</p>
<p>Having to render an account of a singularly bold en
</p>
<p>terprise, I have considered it my duty to make clearly
</p>
<p>appear in what manner we conducted ourselves ; and to
</p>
<p>this end I have deemed it necessary to bring to recol
</p>
<p>lection the situation in which the Revolution then stood,
</p>
<p>the successive phases which had marked its progress,
</p>
<p>and the virtues or vices which appeared to us to have
</p>
<p>exercised any influence upon it. Accordingly, I have
</p>
<p>commenced my narration with a rapid retrospect of this
</p>
<p>Revolution, up to the period of those events which form
</p>
<p>my subject-matter. I have not pretended to write a
</p>
<p>history of them, I have only desired to sketch the im
</p>
<p>pressions which we (the conspirators) received from
</p>
<p>them. To accomplish the task thus imposed upon me, it was
</p>
<p>not sufficient to narrate what Babeuf and his friends

</p>
<p>final end which they proposed to themselves, and the
</p>
<p>manner in which they demonstrated to their own satis

<p>development of their doctrines and of their projects.
</p>
<p>The sources from which I derive all that I affirm rela

<p>tively to this conspiracy, are my own recollections, the

<p>writings of my brother conspirators, the papers of the

<p>few fragments that were, up to this moment, unknown.
</p>
<p>All our papers were not seized by the police. Some

<p>of those which Babeuf had not about him, were de

<p>which they have reached me.

</p>
<p>BABEUF'S CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>PARTIES AND THEIR CHARACTERS DURING THE REVO
</p>
<p>LUTION.
</p>
<p>Amongst the various parties which caused the French
</p>
<p>Revolution to assume so many different complexions,
</p>
<p>there was one which deserves to fix the attention of the
</p>
<p>philosopher, because of the constant devotion with which
</p>
<p>it consecrated its efforts to the real deliverance of hu
</p>
<p>manity. Whilst ambition, jealousy, cupidity, and the blind
</p>
<p>love of innovation, kept up a deplorable struggle among .
</p>
<p>a people, of whom some combatted to reestablish the
</p>
<p>ancient monarchy  others to place upon the French
</p>
<p>throne a new dynasty  others, again, to transfer power
</p>
<p>from one caste of society to another ; but all for the
</p>
<p>purpose of appropriating exclusively to themselves the
</p>
<p>national authority, and thereby those enjoyments of
</p>
<p>which authority is the source: amid all these parties
</p>
<p>there was slowly formed a certain class of citizens who,
</p>
<p>actuated by very different principles, desired also a
</p>
<p>great political change, but one altogether opposed to
</p>
<p>the passions of the former persons, who were only so
</p>
<p>many interested fomenters of civil discords. In fact,
</p>
<p>there was a variety of political sects that aspired, each
</p>
<p>to give to France a form of administration favourable to <
</p>
<p>its own selfish views, but they were very few who sought
</p>
<p>a real radical reform ef society in favour of the mass oi'

</p>
<p>the people.
</p>
<p>6 BABEUF'S CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>Hence it happens that the bulk of those who figured
</p>
<p>on the stage of the Revolution, confined their efforts to
</p>
<p>the barren object of making one order of government
</p>
<p>prevail over another, without at all troubling themselves
</p>
<p>about the condition of those for whose advantage all
</p>
<p>legitimate government ought to exist; and owing to the
</p>
<p>same cause it was, that so many pretended legislators
</p>
<p>imagined themselves to have founded a Republic, when
</p>
<p>they had only condemned a king to death, and substi
</p>
<p>tuted the authority of several for that of an individual.
</p>
<p>Our divisions during the Revolution were the results
</p>
<p>of opposing interests and principles. While one set of
</p>
<p>persons (the honest) supported a system because they
</p>
<p>believed it to be good, another set, far more numerous,
</p>
<p>united themselves to the party that appeared most
</p>
<p>favourable to their personal views of fortune or ambition.
</p>
<p>The former pursued with constant fidelity the path which
</p>
<p>they had originally traced out for themselves ; the latter
</p>
<p>were always shifting their conduct, according to circum
</p>
<p>stances, or their own capricious passions.
</p>
<p>It was only at successive stages of the Revolution,
</p>
<p>however, that one could discern the particular character
</p>
<p>of each political sect, for so long as they had a common
</p>
<p>enemy to combat, they were obliged (whatever their
</p>
<p>differences of opinion) to appear all to act in the same
</p>
<p>spirit; but at each succeeding step towards a new degree
</p>
<p>of amelioration, there was formed a fresh party of oppo
</p>
<p>sitionists, namely, of those interested in maintaining the
</p>
<p>vices against which the new movement was directed.
</p>
<p>Thus, if certain nobles of the Constituent Assembly
</p>
<p>appeared popular at the dawn of the Revolution, they
</p>
<p>were not slow in revealing their true characters, by fol
</p>
<p>lowing an opposite course, the moment that the first
</p>
<p>aspirations were heard in favour of a real equality. If
</p>
<p>others, again, rose up against the reigning family, with

</p>
<p>the design of substituting another in its room, they were
</p>
<p>soon seen to range themselves under the banners of
</p>
<p>royalty, from the moment it became evident that the
</p>
<p>cause of all dynasties was hopeless. If, at first, the
</p>
<p>priests applauded the efforts of the reformers against the
</p>
<p>higher orders of the clergy, they became afterwards the
</p>
<p>bitterest propagators of fanaticism, when once the nation
</p>
<p>BABEUF S CONSPIRACY. 7
</p>
<p>had refused its support to all forms of worship alike. If
</p>
<p>those who had wished to cashier the constitutional mo
</p>
<p>narchy for their own profit, assumed the guise of Repub
</p>
<p>licans to that end, they were to be found in open
</p>
<p>opposition to the more ardent defenders of the Republic,
</p>
<p>from the instant that the people seemed eager for the
</p>
<p>Republic as the most desirable of all things.
</p>
<p>In the midst of the storms thus necessarily pro
</p>
<p>duced by the mixture of so many discordant elements,
</p>
<p>those individuals who, from the commencement of the
</p>
<p>Revolution, had conceived the hope of establishing in
</p>
<p>France the empire of true justice, seized with eagerness
</p>
<p>the frequent occasions which so great a fermentation
</p>
<p>presented, to habituate their fellow citizens to reflect on
</p>
<p>their rights, and to lead them gradually to desire the
</p>
<p>overthrow of all vicious institutions which interdicted the
</p>
<p>enjoyment of them.
</p>
<p>The useful or dangerous passions that agitated
</p>
<p>Frenchmen in one sense or the other, were in some
</p>
<p>measure represented in the Assemblies, which during the
</p>
<p>Revolution exercised the supreme power. In these were
</p>
<p>developed the most abject vices and the most sublime
</p>
<p>virtues. In these was the signal given of so many com
</p>
<p>bats. It was here that the members of the different
</p>
<p>political sects, laid hold on, and gave birth to those
</p>
<p>crises by which they sought to give prevalence to their
</p>
<p>respective systems and interests.
</p>
<p>The party which remained firm to the cause of the
</p>
<p>people, saw itself, at distinct epochs, treacherously
</p>
<p>abandoned and threatened with destruction, by the very
</p>
<p>factions that had assisted in the triumph of its projects,
</p>
<p>up to the moment when those projects began to clash
</p>
<p>with their own selfish views. Whilst the Monarchy
</p>
<p>existed, the Republican party appeared very numerous ;
</p>
<p>and although for a long time one might have perceived

</p>
<p>essential shades of difference amongst those that were
</p>
<p>then ranged under the banners of the Republic, the 10th
</p>
<p>of August, 1792, witnessed a multitude of men combat
</p>
<p>ing against the Court, who afterwards became divided,
</p>
<p>and amongst whom were many that have since espoused
</p>
<p>the cause of kings. Indeed, amongst these combatants,
</p>
<p>as well as amongst those that applauded their triumph,
</p>
<p>8 babeuf's CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>might be enumerated many who were animated only by
</p>
<p>personal jealousy and resentment, and a still greater
</p>
<p>number whom the probability of a Regency, or of a
</p>
<p>change of dynasty, flattered with the hope of a near and
</p>
<p>profitable influence. Be this as it may, however, there
</p>
<p>exists every reason to believe that the majority were at
</p>
<p>/ that time in favour of a Republican Government, al
</p>
<p>though the different parties diverged widely from one
</p>
<p>another, both in respect of the ideas they had formed of
</p>
<p>Republicanism, and of the passions which impelled them
</p>
<p>to desire that form of Government.
</p>
<p>All the various systems of politics and of public eco
</p>
<p>nomy, served as motives or pretexts for the dissensions
</p>
<p>of the National Convention. Some preached the ex
</p>
<p>clusive influence of the class favoured by fortune and by
</p>
<p>education ; others regarded a participation by all in the
</p>
<p>sovereign power as an essential condition of the durable
</p>
<p>tranquillity and well-being of society. The former sighed
</p>
<p>after the riches, the superfluities, and the display of
</p>
<p>Athens ; the latter desired the frugality, the simplicity,
</p>
<p>and the modesty of the fine days of Sparta. It is
</p>
<p>rendering, however, but a very imperfect view of the
</p>
<p>nature of these dissensions, to compare them with the
</p>
<p>political systems of the ancients. To understand it well,
</p>
<p>we must consider the state of manners, and our acquaint
</p>
<p>ance with natural rights.
</p>
<p>What passed in France immediately after the creation
</p>
<p>of the Republic, is, in my view, only the explosion of
</p>
<p>that discord, which ever exists between the partizans of
</p>
<p>opulence and distinctions on the one hand, and the
</p>
<p>friends of equality, or the numerous class of labourers, on
</p>
<p>the other. By tracing the stream higher up, we shall
</p>

<p>in that of Jean Jacques Rousseau, Mably, and other
</p>
<p>modern philosophers on the other.
</p>
<p>* I comprise under this denomination, as well those writers and
</p>
<p>statesmen who would subject industry and commerce to regula
</p>
<p>tions, ns those who would give the most extended freedom to their
</p>
<p>operations.
</p>
<p>BABEUF S CONSPIRACY. 9
</p>
<p>Let us call to mind, that very many writers have
</p>
<p>made the prosperity of nations to consist in the multi
</p>
<p>plicity of their wants  in the ever augmenting diversity
</p>
<p>of their material enjoyments  in an immense industry 
</p>
<p>in an unlimited commerce  in the rapid circulation ot
</p>
<p>the monied metals  and (as the last step of the analysis)
</p>
<p>in the restlessness and insatiable cupidity of the popu
</p>
<p>lation* At one time they prefer the heaping together
</p>
<p>of territorial property, at another, they declare for the
</p>
<p>multiplication of small proprietorships ; and whilst some
</p>
<p>have believed that the misery and brutalization of the
</p>
<p>productive classes are essential to the opulence and tran
</p>
<p>quillity of the whole, others, by holding forth the unre
</p>
<p>stricted and unlimited freedom of industry and commercial
</p>
<p>transactions, as a means of remedying the established
</p>
<p>inequality, have only paved the wav for a new system
</p>
<p>of corruption, and for new inequalities, more extensive
</p>
<p>aid pernicious than what before existed. For, once the
</p>
<p>happiness and strength of society were placed in riches, it
</p>
<p>became a necessary consequence to debar from the exercise
</p>
<p>of political rights all the citizens who do not offer by their
</p>
<p>fortunes a guarantee or pledge of attachment to such an
</p>
<p>order of things  an order reputed, as it were, the perfection
</p>
<p>of the social state. In all social systems of this kind, the
</p>
<p>great majority of the citizens being incessantly subjected
</p>
<p>to painful drudgery are, in effect, condemned to languish
</p>
<p>all their days in misery, ignorance, and slavery. +
</p>
<p>* It was always difficult for men to understand one another,
</p>
<p>with a view to the establishing of a rational social order. It was
</p>
<p>by a traffic in superfluities, and by the arts of luxury, that our
</p>
<p>forefathers, snatched without violence a part of their riches from
</p>
<p>the favoured sons of feudality. Slaves, by thus becoming neces:
</p>
<p>sary to their masters, enfeebled their power. An evil which
</p>
<p>served as a cure for another evil, was taken for the supreme good
</p>
<p>at the point, where, in the eyes of many, liberty is but another

</p>
<p>t From the vast disproportion between the numerically large
</p>
<p>class of labourers (salwi^s) and the comparatively small class of
</p>
<p>capitalists (saUrians), must necessarily result the misery of the
</p>
<p>former. Overcharged as they are with labour, their ignorance
</p>
<p>becomes as much a matter of necessity to themselves, as it is a
</p>
<p>necessary safeguard to their taskmasters, who would have every
</p>
<p>thing to fear from their knowledge, in consequence of having
</p>
<p>thrown upon them their own proper share of the general burdens.
</p>
<p>From ignorance and misery arises the slavery of our couniry;
</p>
<p>which exists wherever men want the power or the knowledge to

<p>exercise their volition B 5

</p>
<p>Rousseau proclaimed the inalienable rights
</p>
<p>Iy ualit0f of human nature- He Pleaded for a11 mankind
</p>
<p>qU ' Y' without distinction. He placed the prosperity
</p>
<p>of society in the happiness of each of its members, and
</p>
<p>its strength in the attachment of all to the laws. In his
</p>
<p>view, public riches consist in the industry and moderation
</p>
<p>of the citizens, and liberty resides in the power of the
</p>
<p>sovereign, which is the entire body of the people, and of
</p>
<p>which each element preserves in itself the influence
</p>
<p>necessary to the social body, by means of an impartial
</p>
<p>distribution of enjoyments and of intelligence.
</p>
<p>This social order subjects to the will of the sovereign
</p>
<p>people the acts and properties of each individual, en
</p>
<p>courages the arts which are useful to all, proscribes those
</p>
<p>which only flatter the vanities of the few, develops, without
</p>
<p>predilection or partiality, the reason of each citizen,
</p>
<p>substitutes for base cupidity the love of country and of
</p>
<p>glory, and constitutes the whole of society into one vast,
</p>
<p>peaceable family, in which each member is subject to the
</p>
<p>will of the whole, but no member to that of another.
</p>
<p>This social order of Rousseau is the same for which all
</p>
<p>true philosophers have sighed from time immemorial, and
</p>
<p>has had illustrious advocates in all ages, as, for example,
</p>
<p>in ancient days, Minos, Plato, Lycurgus, and the law

<p>giver of the Christians (Jesus Christ) ; and in modern

<p>cannot be smothered unless by a community of goods. The prin

<p>SYSTEM. That of Rousseau the ORDER OF
</p>
<p>EQUALITY. *
</p>
<p>From the moment that the tendencies of the different
</p>
<p>political sects, which figured on the stage of the Revolu-
</p>
<p>* Equality, the sentiment of which is the base of sociability,
</p>
<p>and the consolation of the wretched, is a chimera only in the eyes
</p>
<p>of men that are depraved by the love of riches and of power.
</p>
<p>All systems and all passions apart, where is the human being
</p>
<p>that does not, in his heart, recognise an equal in an individual of
</p>
<p>his own species, whatever he may be ? Where is the man, who,
</p>
<p>placed in the same situation, does not experience an equal pang
</p>
<p>of pity at beholding the sufferings of any of his fellow men ? This
</p>
<p>sentiment, trie effect of our earliest impressions, is justified by
</p>
<p>reason, which teaches us, that nature has. made all men equal.
</p>
<p>But how, and in what respects 1 To comprehend this rightly is
</p>
<p>important. The advocates of social inequalities pretend that they are in
</p>
<p>evitable, because, as they say, they are derived from those which
</p>
<p>nature herself has established between individuals of the human
</p>
<p>species. Mankind, they say, differing naturally in sex, size,
</p>
<p>colour, features, age, and vigour of limb and muscle, cannot pos
</p>
<p>sibly be equal either in power or riches ; equality, whether na
</p>
<p>tural or social, is, therefore, a mere creature of reason or of
</p>
<p>imagination. But granting that the natural differences just mentioned do really
</p>
<p>exist, does it, therefore, follow that the inequalities of institut ion are
</p>
<p>necessary consequences of them 1 Why, according to this rea
</p>
<p>soning, opulence and authority would always go hand in hand
</p>
<p>with physical force, with majesty of size and beauty  a conse
</p>

<p>in their conformation, than of the circumstances in which they

<p>that intellectual inequality exists by nature, to the degree pre

<p>circumstance the source of those distinctions in riches and power

</p>
<p>for whose existence we contend, is only that uinfGnmty oi wants

<p>use that we make of our senses and organs. The want ot food
</p>
<p>the desire of procreation -self-love pity sympathetic affections
</p>
<p>the disposition to feel, to think, to will, to communicate our
</p>
<p>ideas, and understand those of our companions, and to conform
</p>
<p>our actions to rules  hatred of constraint and We of freedom;
</p>
<p>these are what exist in pretty nearly the same degrees, in the
</p>
<p>bosoms of all sound and well-constituted human beings. Such is
</p>
<p>the natural law, from which emanate, for all men, the same natural
</p>
<p>rights. In the eyes of him, who recognises in himself a being composed
</p>
<p>of two substances of distinct natures, a new argument, in favour
</p>
<p>of natural equality, may be derived from the spirituality of the
</p>
<p>thinking principle. This principle, which constitutes to him alone
</p>
<p>his entire human self (tout le moi huwuiii), being indivisible and
</p>
<p>pure, and derived always from the same source, is necessarily
</p>
<p>equal in every individual of our species. As to the inequality oi
</p>
<p>physical strength, it is certain that it can be no bar to the enjoy
</p>
<p>ment of natural equality, at any rute no more than a momentary
</p>
<p>bar ; and it was probably to obviate this evil that recourse has
</p>
<p>been hud to conventions, and that civil society was instituted.
</p>
<p>And here, for want of foresight, mankind have precipitated
</p>
<p>themselves into a greater calamity than the one they had wished
</p>
<p>to guard against. The equality established by nature, and avowed
</p>
<p>by reason, has been violated in society by a succession of these
</p>
<p>same Conventions which were designed to maintain it. For the
</p>
<p>transitory inconveniences produced by the inequalities of physical
</p>
<p>force have been substit uted other inconveniences more fatal, more
</p>
<p>permanent, and more inevitable, by the conventional inequalities

<p>have been enabled to overburden with painful toils and duties,
</p>
<p>and to deprive of their natural liberty, the great majority of the
</p>
<p>strongest, most virtuous, and even best instructed.
</p>
<p>From the unequal distribution of wealth nnd poweT arise all the
</p>
<p>disorders of which nine-tenths of the inhabitants of all civilized
</p>
<p>countries justly complain. From thence result to them privations,

<p>suffering's, humiliations, nnd slavery. From the same source re
</p>
<p>sults also that intellectual inequality which, through interested
</p>
<p>motives, is falsely ascribed to an exaggerated inequality of mental
</p>
<p>capacity. It is, therefore, to restrain within just limits the riches
</p>
<p>and power of individuals, that all true social institutions should

<p>pnd power, by subjecting all citizens equally to laws emanating
</p>
<p>;om the whole and riches, by providing such institutions for
</p>
<p>hstnbution, as would give to each enough, and to nobody more
</p>
<p>'hau enough. Behold in what consists the equality treated of in
</p>
<p>this work.
</p>
<p>Indeed, at the point to which things have arrived now, this

<p>equality may be said to regard riches only ; for wealth alone,

<p>:here were, besides those whom old preju- ^J^e friends
</p>
<p>lices attached to it, many that aspired to qua 1 y"

<p>to smother by calumny and persecution.

<p>But it was especially after the 10th of August, 1792,

<p>that the men I have just described, conceived the most

<p>flattering hopes, and redoubled their noble efforts to
</p>
<p>secure the triumph of their sublime cause. To the merit
</p>
<p>of Rousseau's conceptions, they added the boldness of
</p>
<p>applying them to a society of five and twenty millions of
</p>
<p>men. At this same epoch, too, the struggle between the
</p>
<p>friends of equality and the partisans of the Order of

<p>Egoism became more characterized and more animated.
</p>
<p>The project of governing the state under a show of

<p>republican forms, while at the same time retaining all

</p>
<p>From the victory of the 10th of August resulted im
</p>
<p>mediately some progress of the popular cause. A few
</p>
<p>days after the fall of the throne, the exercise of political
</p>
<p>rights was extended to all citizens, without distinction. .,
</p>
<p>All were declared eligible to public functions, and it was
</p>
<p>solemnly recognized that no constitution could be im
</p>
<p>posed on the people without their consent. At the same
</p>
<p>time marriage was legallv disembarrassed of that de
</p>
<p>plorable (dhespirinte) indissolubility which often ren
</p>
<p>ders it as inimical to the happiness of individuals and
</p>
<p>families, as it is disastrous to morals and liberty. It is
</p>
<p>a fact deserving observation, that the energy of the
</p>
<p>nation in defence of the Revolution invariably expanded
</p>
<p>or diminished in proportion as the laws seemed to favour
</p>
<p>equality or to oppose it. It was the working class  that
</p>
<p>class so maltreated and so unjustly despised in society 
</p>
<p>which achieved all the prodigies of virtue and devotion
</p>
<p>to which the Revolution gave birth. The rest of the
</p>
<p>community (with very few exceptions) only threw ob
</p>
<p>structions in the way of the national regeneration.
</p>
<p>It is an unquestionable fact that the Aristocrats in

<p>* The aristocratic system, or exercise of sovereign power, by a

</p>
<p>the inequality consecrated by the Order of Egoism.

<p>t The impost progressive differs from the proportional impost
</p>
<p>in this that the relation of the latter to a man's income is always

<p>the same, tie tax preserving a uniform ratio to his fortune 
</p>
<p>whereas in the impost progressive the ratio itself increases at the

</p>
<p>CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.
</p>
<p>This faction was called Girondist, because it recognised for its
</p>
<p>chiefs almost all the deputies from the department of La Crironae,
</p>
<p>to the Legislative Assembly, and to the Convention.
</p>
<p>So soon as the first Declaration of Rights was proclaimed by
</p>
<p>the Constituent Assembly, the frank and unqualified application
</p>
<p>of the principles of natural j ustice with which some of them were
</p>
<p>consecrated in it, proved revolting to men led astray by a false
</p>
<p>science, or corrupted by the vices of civilization. From that
</p>
<p>moment they only meditated how they might best elude the prin
</p>
<p>ciples, while they affected and appeared to applaud them.
</p>
<p>This was the origin of the factions which, under the first three
</p>
<p>National Assemblies, exerted themselves to arrest the impulse
</p>
<p>(elan) of the French people towards complete emancipation, ana
</p>
<p>to confine the Revolution to those systems which they judged
</p>
<p>most favourable to their passions, or most conformable to their
</p>
<p>doctrines. These proved much moi'e hurtful to the establishment
</p>
<p>of liberty, than the open opposition of the privileged classes,

</p>
<p>because they have deceived the people by borrowing from them
</p>
<p>the language of patriotism.
</p>
<p>Towards the close of the Constituent Assembly, the spirit of
</p>
<p>these factions predominated in it, and the party which remained
</p>
<p>faithful to the public cause would have been unnoticed, had it not
</p>
<p>forced itself into attention by the energy of its remonstrances. It
</p>
<p>is to this spirit we are to ascribe the retrograde movements and
</p>
<p>contradictions of this Assembly.
</p>
<p>In contempt of the equality of right which had been decreed by
</p>
<p>.- the Constitution, millions of citizens were deprived of the right
</p>
<p>* of suffrage, and of eligibility. A law of blood was opposed to the
</p>
<p>complaints excited by the misery of the people, and by the equi
</p>
<p>vocal course of the legislature. The latter were obstinately bent,
</p>
<p>in defiance of good sense and the national will, to replace the
</p>
<p>safeguard of the constitution in the hands of a king who had just
</p>
<p>openly avowed himself its enemy, and whose power, instead of
</p>
<p>extinguishing, they had increased. They caused to flow in the

<p>authority had made itself generally felt, and it was pretty

<p>commonly believed that a good distribution of political

</p>
<p>to solicit a contrary decision. They forced the people to have
</p>
<p>recourse to violence in order to obtain that justice which a simple
</p>
<p>decree might have peaceably operated. They struck a blow at the
</p>
<p>right to assemble and petition, and wished to chain the nation for
</p>
<p>ever to the chariot wheels of the aristocracy.
</p>
<p>To the real contempt which the Constituent Assembly had for
</p>
<p>the mass of the people, we are to attribute the feebleness of their
</p>
<p>efforts against the royal power, which, while they pretended to
</p>
<p>shake, they really desired to convert into a rampart against demo
</p>
<p>cratic effervescence. Hence, also, its negligence to profit by the
</p>
<p>people's enthusiasm and the errors of the court, in order to anni
</p>
<p>hilate the monarchy or tie it up within limits which would have
</p>
<p>made it, in effect, almost a republic.
</p>
<p>Such are the causes of the suspicions which subsequently arose
</p>
<p>against the Lameths, against La Fayette, against the minority of
</p>
<p>the Noblesse, and against several distinguished members of the
</p>
<p>Third Estate. The same views were shared by the famous
</p>
<p>Mirabeau, the extreme corruption of whose morals, forced him
</p>
<p>through the allurements of gain, to become the champion of that
</p>
<p>monarchy against which he had just successfully combatted.

<p>THE GIRONDIST FACTION.
</p>
<p>But the love of luxury, the thirst of gold, and the desire to shine

<p>and govern, were not engrossed by the Noblesse alone ; there was

<p>between them and the immense class of working men, another

<p>lawyers, physicians, bankers, rich merchants, opulent citizens,
</p>
<p>and men of letters, who trafficed in science, and made it the
</p>
<p>ladder of their ambition. Greedy, vain, and restless, it plunged
</p>
<p>into tie first movements of the Revolution, and induced the mul
</p>
<p>titude, whom poverty and want of instruction made dependent on
</p>
<p>them, to participate in their schemes of ambition. The members

<p>of this class being masters of most of the tribunes for haranguing
</p>
<p>the people (tribunes aux harangues), and of the administrations,
</p>
<p>pushed themselves, through the suffrages of their friends, into the
</p>
<p>Legislative Assembly and the Convention, where they formed the
</p>
<p>nucleus of the Girondist faction.
</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the Girondists did not desire the ancient
</p>
<p>regime in all its hideousness, but still less did they desire that the
</p>
<p>new regime should progress so far as to confound them with what
</p>
<p>they called the " low people" (basveuple), and strip them of that
</p>
<p>superiority which was so profitable to them. As to whether
</p>
<p>France was governed in the manner of Monarchy or of a Republic,
</p>
<p>at bottom they cared not a rush, provided to them and their

<p>ensure public submission and obedience to the laws  laws of
</p>
<p>which they (the Girondists) should have the sole enactment and

<p>nately combat or favour the particular interests of Louis XVI., just
</p>
<p>according as that monarch pretended to follow the planof his
</p>
<p>ancient courtesans, or submit himself to the councils of this faction.
</p>
<p>The personal views of its chiefs in the secret negociations which
</p>
<p>they entered upon with the king in the official councils they gave
</p>
<p>him to the effect of strengthening his power, were fully proved
</p>
<p>by living witnesses and documentary evidence. Indeed, some of
</p>
<p>the Girondists, most notable in their party, had not been ashamed
</p>
<p>to publish in their memoirs, their confession of attachment to the
</p>
<p>Monarchy, and their aspirations for its re-establishment after it
</p>
<p>had ceased to exist.
</p>
<p>PROOFS OF THEIR HATRED OF REPUBLICANISM.
</p>
<p>It is a gross error to suppose the Girondists were real friends of
</p>
<p>liberty, or frank Republicans. Had they been so, would they
</p>

<p>In the absence of the writings, discourses, and facts,

<p>ence to the sincere friends of equalitv tion-
</p>
<p>only. Its false and interested friends appeared to triumph
</p>
<p>with it ; but the latter, who were active destroyers only
</p>
<p>for their own profit, immediately flung themselves into
</p>
<p>the old system they had combatted, when it became
</p>
<p>necessary to build up another for the people.
</p>
<p>Amongst the individuals that shone in the revolutionary
</p>
<p>arena, there were a few who, from the outset, declared
</p>
<p>themselves for a complete emancipation of the French
</p>
<p>people. Marat, Maximilien Robespierre, and Saint Just,
</p>
<p>figured gloriously, with some others, in this honourable"
</p>
<p>list of the champions of equality. Marat and Robespierre
</p>
<p>attacked in front the anti-popular system which pre
</p>
<p>vailed in the Constituent Assembly. By these were the
</p>
<p>steps of the patriots directed before and after the 10 th
</p>
<p>of August ; elected to the Convention, they were there
</p>
<p>exposed to all the hatred and calumnies of the egoistical
</p>
<p>or aristocratic factions, whom they confounded and un
</p>
<p>masked. In giving judgment on the king, they elevated
</p>
<p>themselves to the highest philosophy, and they had a
</p>
<p>principal share in the events of the 31st of May and days
</p>
<p>following," the happy influence of which was afterwards
</p>
<p>destroyed by the false friends of equality.
</p>
<p>Previously to the fall of the Girondists, Declaration of

<p>Robespierre believed that it was impos- fespienlj R
</p>
<p>sible for the Convention, governed as it
</p>
<p>was by that faction, to originate good laws. He thought,
</p>
<p>moreover, that in the then critical state of the country,
</p>
<p>the first care of the people's mandatories ought to be to
</p>
<p>annihilate the hordes of enemies which, from within and

<p>safe and certain triumph. Such was the effect of the courage and

<p>firmness of the Mountainists, the adverse party to the Girondists

<p>in the Convention. At this epoch the Mountain was composed of

<p>in juxta-position with the purity of his morals, his de-

<p>this purpose than by transcribing here his project of the Declaration

<p>of Rights. This remarkable document lets in a full light on the

<p>real and ultimate designs of those men, so furiously proscribed

<p>admire in it the definition of the right of property, which ceases to

<p>Citizen : 
</p>

</p>
<p>up in consequence of the insurrection of the 31st May, >
</p>
<p>by the party then called the Mountain, did not corn-
</p>
<p>Art. 2. The principal rights of man are those of providing for
</p>
<p>the preservation of his existence and liberty.
</p>
<p>Art. 3. These rights belong to all men equally, whatever dif
</p>
<p>ference may be in their physical and moral force. Equality of
</p>
<p>rights is established by Nature. Society, so far from invading it,
</p>
<p>constitutes its security against the abuse of force, which would
</p>
<p>render it illusory.
</p>
<p>Art. 4. Liberty is the power which belongs to a man of exercising
</p>
<p>all his faculties at pleasure. It has justice for its rule, the rights
</p>
<p>of others for its boundaries, nature for its origin, and the law for
</p>
<p>its safeguard.
</p>
<p>Art. 5. The right of peaceably assembling  of manifesting
</p>
<p>opinions, whether through the press, or by any other means  are
</p>
<p>so necessary consequences of the principles of man's liberty, that
</p>
<p>the necessity of declaring them supposes either the presence or
</p>
<p>rthe recent remembrance of despotism.
</p>
<p>Art. 6. Property is the right which each citizen has to enjoy
</p>
<p>and to dispose of, at his pleasure, the portion of fortune or wealth
</p>
<p>that is guaranteed to him by the Law.
</p>
<p>Art. 7. The right of property is limited, like all other rights, by
</p>
<p>the obligation to respect the rights of others.
</p>
<p>Art. 8. It can prejudice neither safety, nor liberty, nor existence,
</p>
<p>nor the property of our fellow-citizens.
</p>
<p>Art. 9. All traffic that violates this principle is essentially illicit
</p>
<p>and immoral.
</p>
<p>Art. 10. Society is under obligation to provide subsistence for
</p>
<p>all its members, either by procuring employment for them, or by en
</p>
<p>suring the means of existence to those that are incapable of labour.
</p>
<p>Art. 11. The relief indispensible to those that are in want of
</p>
<p>necessaries is a debt due from the possessors of superfluities. It
</p>
<p>belongs to the law to determine the manner in which the debt
</p>
<p>should be discharged.

<p>Art, 12. Citizens, whose income does not exceed what is ne

</p>
<p>according to the extent of their fortunes.

<p>Art. 13. Society ought to favour, with all its power, the progress
</p>
<p>of public reason, and place instruction within the reach of every

</p>
<p>its property ; the public functionaries are its agents and officers ;
</p>
<p>the people may, when it pleases, revoke its mandatories.
</p>
<p>Art. 15. The law is the free and solemn expression of the people's
</p>
<p>will. Art. 16. The law ought to be equal for all.
</p>
<p>Art. 17. The law can forbid only what is hurtful to society ; it
</p>
<p>can prescribe only what is useful.
</p>
<p>Art. 18. Every law that violates the imprescriptible rights of
</p>
<p>man is essentially unjust and tyrannical ; it is no law at all.
</p>
<p>Art. 19. In every free state the law ought, above all, to defend
</p>
<p>public and individual liberty against the authority of those that
</p>
<p>govern. Every institution that does not suppose the peoplj good,
</p>
<p>and the magistrate corruptible, is vicious.

<p>One regrets to find in it the old deplorable ideas on the

<p>right of property. For the rest, the political rights of
</p>
<p>Art. 20. No part of the people can exercise the power of the
</p>
<p>whole people ; but the wish it expresses ought to be respected, as
</p>
<p>a wish of part of the people, which is to concur in forming the
</p>
<p>general will. Each section of the sovereign assembly ought to
</p>
<p>enjoy the right of expressing its will with perfect liberty ; it is
</p>
<p>essentially independent of all constituted authorities, and com
</p>
<p>petent to regulate its own policy and deliberations.
</p>
<p>Art. 21. All the citizens are equally admissible to all public
</p>
<p>functions, without any other distinctions than those of virtue and
</p>
<p>talents without any other title than the confidence of the people.
</p>
<p>Art. 22. All the citizens have an equal right to concur in the
</p>
<p>Qomination of the delegates of the people, and in the formation
</p>
<p>of the law.
</p>
<p>Art. 23. In order that these rights be not illusory, and equality
</p>
<p>chimerical, society ought to pay the public functionaries, and to
</p>
<p>provide that the citizens who live by their labour may be able to
</p>
<p>assist at the public assemblies to which the law calls them, without
</p>
<p>compromising their means of existence, or that of their families.
</p>
<p>Art. 24. Every citizen ought religiously to obey the magistrates
</p>
<p>and agents of the Government, whilst they are the organs and
</p>
<p>executors of the law.
</p>
<p>Art. 25. But every act against the liberty, the safety, or against
</p>
<p>the property of a man, by whomsoever exercised, even in the
</p>
<p>name of the law itself, if not comprehended within the cases
</p>
<p>determined by the law, and within the forms it prescribes  every
</p>
<p>such act is arbitrary and null. The very respect due to the law
</p>
<p>forbids submission to it, and if the attempt be made to execute
</p>
<p>such act by violence, it is permitted to repel force by force.
</p>
<p>Art. 26. The right of presenting petitions to the depositaries of
</p>
<p>the public authority belongs to every individual. Those to whom
</p>
<p>they are addressed ought to determine upon the points which con
</p>
<p>stitute the object of them ; but they can never either interdict, or

<p>restrict, or condemn the exercise of the right.
</p>
<p>Art. 27. Resistance to oppression is the consequence of the
</p>
<p>other rights of man and of the citizen.
</p>
<p>Art. 28. There is oppression against the social body whenever
</p>
<p>one alone of its members is oppressed. There is oppression against
</p>
<p>every member of it when the social body is oppressed.
</p>
<p>Art. 29. When the Government violates the rights of the people,
</p>
<p>insurrection is for the people, and for every portion of the people
</p>
<p>the most sacred of rights, and the most indispensible of duties.
</p>
<p>Art. 30. When the social guarantee or compact fails to protect
</p>
<p>a citizen, he resumes his natural right to defend personally all his
</p>
<p>rights. Art. 31. In either of the two preceding cases, to subject to
</p>
<p>legal forms the resistance to oppression, is the last refinement of
</p>
<p>tyranny. Art. 32. Public functions cannot be considered as distinctions,
</p>
<p>nor as recompenses, but as public duties.
</p>
<p>Art. 33. The crimes of the delegates of the people ought to be
</p>
<p>spverely and promptly punished. No one has the right of pretend
</p>

<p>on their country's altar, thundered in mass on the armies
</p>
<p>of the coalesced sovereigns, and contented themselves
</p>
<p>with demanding for their all, bread, steel, and equality ?
</p>
<p>These facts, attested by an infinite number of addresses,

<p>annals of France, by the terror (not yet extinct) of the

<p>had the same results in view as the wise friends of equality, but
</p>
<p>they had not, like the latter, formed clear ideas, either of the in
</p>
<p>stitutions by which it was to be be won, nor of the route by which
</p>
<p>it was necessary to arrive at it. It is not to them, however, that
</p>
<p>we ought, to impute the disastrous division in the ranks of equality,
</p>
<p>and the calamities operated by the faction they belonged to. A
</p>
<p>responsibility so grave rests entirely with those influential persons
</p>
<p>who, in the name of the public good, inspired them with unworthy
</p>
<p>suspicions, and for whose criminal blindness there can hardly be
</p>
<p>found a just excuse.
</p>
<p>The Dantonists have no claim to the like indulgence, because
</p>
<p>the predominant character of this faction was a compound of
</p>
<p>vanity, intrigue, audacity, falsehood, venality, and corruption.
</p>
<p>Its acknowledged chiefs openly professed maxims the very reverse
</p>
<p>babeuf s conspiracy. 33
</p>
<p>This faction conspired also against the promoters of
</p>
<p>democratic institutions. It failed, however, in its first
</p>
<p>efforts, and had to witness the destruction of some of
</p>
<p>its chiefs ;* but the survivors of the party, rallying to
</p>
<p>the cry of national justice which threatened them, flat
</p>
<p>tering the enemies of the Revolution of all shades, sup
</p>
<p>ported by the deluded patriots ,f in whom they excited
</p>
<p>of that moral purity upon which the French Government of that
</p>
<p>epoch desired to base the new Republic. Servile imitators of the
</p>
<p>profligacy which, before the Revolution, had distinguished the
</p>
<p>Court and the privileged orders, they combatted the aristocrats of
</p>
<p>the old regime, only to put themselves in their place,  and they
</p>
<p>rose against religion, not with the view of emancipating mankind
</p>
<p>from the yoke of prejudice and superstition, nor of disarming
</p>
<p>despotism of its most redoubtable auxiliary, but only to dis
</p>
<p>encumber themselves of the sore idea of an all-seeing judge, in
</p>
<p>order the more tranquilly to abandon themselves to their base pas
</p>
<p>sions, and to efface from the human mind the consolatory sentiments
</p>
<p>of justice, probity, and virtue. The Dantonists considered the
</p>
<p>Revolution as a game of hazard, in which victory belongs to the
</p>
<p>most crafty and the most knavish. They had a smile of pity for
</p>
<p>the words disinterestedness, virtue, equality, and did not hesitate to
</p>
<p>declare, that in the account between France and the Revolution,
</p>
<p>the advantages of fortune and power enj oyed by the old aristocracy
</p>
<p>ought, as a matter of course, to pass into the hands of the successful
</p>
<p>Revolutionists. Accordingly, many that then swelled their ranks
</p>
<p>have since not been ashamed to borrow the most opposite colours,
</p>
<p>to flatter all tyrannies in turn, and to abandon themselves to the
</p>
<p>meanest intrigues, in order to acquire fortune and retain a shadow
</p>
<p>of power.
</p>
<p>By the leaders of these two factions were the most dangerous
</p>
<p>machinations hatched and plotted ; and it was not without grave
</p>
<p>reasons that the Revolutionary Government (of Robespierre, &c.)
</p>
<p>accused them of acting in concert with the foreign cabinets then
</p>
<p>in league against the French Republic.

<p>Whatever may have been the secret understanding of then-
</p>
<p>chiefs, certain it is, at any rate, that the two factions laboured to
</p>
<p>throw every thing into confusion ; and that they both applauded
</p>
<p>and co-operated in the disastrous events of the 9th Thermidor.
</p>
<p>They did so, however, under the influence of very opposite motives
</p>
<p>and ends. The Dantonists wished to disembarrass themselves of
</p>
<p>an equality that they hated, and of the Republican austerity
</p>
<p>which bridled their licentiousness, whilst the poor Hebertists
</p>
<p>acted under the mad impression that equality and the Republic
</p>
<p>were about to be delivered and consolidated by the result. The
</p>
<p>latter were soon undeceived. By degrees their eyes opened, and
</p>
<p>they soon re-attached themselves to the men whose conduct they
</p>
<p>had a little before condemned, and they subsequently shared the
</p>
<p>proscription in which every honest man in France was involved
</p>
<p>by that rotten faction, whose revolting immorality always tended

<p>to confound them with the partisans of despotism.

</p>
<p>been the principal instigators of this deplorable day's proceedings.
</p>
<p>Alarmed by the punishment of the conspirators (Danton, Lacroix,

<p>they easily communicated their fears to others similarly con

<p>of the enemies of equality.
</p>
<p>A thousand different motives of interest, jealousy, vanity, aris

<p>burst on the Republic. One might recognise them by the ab

<p>the power of his wise councils, and the influence of his virtue. He

<p>was the tyrant of the wicked  he was a tyrant against all tyrannies.

<p>to save him ! The very men who the evening before called him

<p>same time that you are not ashamed to pretend that he subjected

<p>you for fifteen months to his domination. One batch of you called

</p>
<p>ary Government had passed into the hands aryGo^rnment
</p>
<p>of the Egoists it became a veritable pub- becomes a pub
</p>
<p>lic scourge. Its prompt and terrible ac- hc scouree-
</p>
<p>tion, which the virtue of its former directors and their
</p>
<p>thoroughly popular designs could alone render legitimate,
</p>
<p>became thenceforward but a frightful tyranny, both as
</p>
<p>regarded its objects and form. It demoralised every
</p>
<p>thing ; it restored luxury, debauchery, effeminate man 
</p>
<p>ners, and brigandism; it squandered the national do
</p>
<p>mains, denaturalised the principles of the Revolution,
</p>
<p>and delivered over to the poignards of its enemies all
</p>
<p>who had defended it with sincerity and disinterestedness.
</p>
<p>It was to the maintenance of inequality, and to the es
</p>
<p>tablishment of aristocracy, that manifestly tended, at
</p>
<p>this epoch, the efforts of the dominant party. After
</p>
<p>having deprived the people of all hope of an equitable
</p>
<p>legislation, and plunged them into incertitude and dis

<p>couragement, it was meditating to despoil them of
</p>
<p>even the feeble remains of their sovereignty.

<p>ing to a durable state what was only the sad necessity of a state of
</p>
<p>transition, they laboured to make it be believed that the Order of
</p>
<p>Equality is neither more nor less than one interminable series of
</p>
<p>violence, massacres, executions, hatreds, and vengeance.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, very little discernment suffices to detect in these
</p>
<p>declamations the rage and malice of the parties that dictated them ;
</p>
<p>and if men will only judge without passion, they will be forced to
</p>
<p>agree that love of country and the sentiment of duties the most
</p>
<p>imperiqus, determined the friends of equality, after a too long and
</p>
<p>very disastrous patience, to at last resort to severity against its
</p>
<p>incorrigible enemies.
</p>
<p>The justice and necessity of the revolutionary institution once
</p>
<p>recognised, it is no longer necessary to the question to examine up
</p>
<p>38 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>nceuvres of the aristocracy. Despairing of the triumph
</p>
<p>of social equality, they desired, at least, to put the people
</p>
<p>in possession of their political rights. Such was the
</p>
<p>to what point the presiding authority carried the severity of which
</p>
<p>it was necessitated to make use. The only important matter is to
</p>
<p>know, whether it answered the ends for which it was instituted.
</p>
<p>Its province was to establish the reign of equality and the laws,
</p>
<p>and in this vocation it laboured, without interruption, till the 9tb
</p>
<p>Thermidor of the Year II., either in reforming morals, and the
</p>
<p>spirit of the laws, or in levelling the obstacles that were incessantly
</p>
<p>reared up against the execution of so sublime an enterprise. These
</p>
<p>obstacles lay in the armed opposition of Europe, in the seductions
</p>
<p>and ever-reviving conspiracies set on foot by a party that had
</p>
<p>rather perish in the conflagration it had kindled, than bend its
</p>
<p>haughty head to the level of equality, and renounce its vicious and
</p>
<p>despotic habits. With such enemies to deal with, the question
</p>
<p>was not whether they should be punished, but how they were to
</p>
<p>be exterminated.
</p>
<p>Let us call to mind the rapidity with which the plcts of the aris
</p>
<p>tocracy against the power of the people succeeded one another
</p>
<p>since the commencement of the Revolution. Irom the moment
</p>
<p>that the Republic was proclaimed, and especially after the insur
</p>
<p>rection of the 31st May, there was manifested amongst the op
</p>
<p>posing parties a fermentation so intense, so general, and so
</p>
<p>characterised, that one might, without fear of mistake, recognise
</p>
<p>every enemy of reform by his conduct, his manners, and opinions.
</p>
<p>For a long time the danger was so imminent that the people
</p>
<p>would have been justified in thundering down at once upon the
</p>
<p>class of society it dreaded. The Revolutionary Government did
</p>
<p>in the name of the people what the people had the right of doing,
</p>
<p>but it did the business far more usefully. Things were arrived at
</p>
<p>^ that pass when it was necessary to choose between the annihilation
</p>
<p>; of certain conspirators on the one hand, and the inevitable ruin of
</p>
<p>popular rights on the other. The case was one in which we should
</p>
<p>consider the end, not the means. Was the end just ? The severity

<p>motive of the movement of the 12th Germinal of the

<p>fury of the enemies of liberty, and greatly augmented

<p>of injustice. They punish in a moment the accumulated crimes

</p>
<p>new ones unavoidable ? Why did not the parties, that are pleased
</p>
<p>to exaggerate what they call- the excesses of the French Revolu
</p>
<p>tion, prevent their occurrence, by the voluntary abandonment of
</p>
<p>their iniquitous pretensions, which were the whole and sole causes
</p>
<p>of them?
</p>
<p>There has been a world of declamation on the subject of the
</p>
<p>numerous arrests, ordered on mere suspicion, and on the brevity
</p>
<p>of the proceedings instituted against the accused conspirators.
</p>
<p>But be it observed, that at a time when conspiracies spring out of
</p>
<p>the intense irritation of passions common to a vast number of
</p>
<p>powerful and crafty men, it is easy for the conspirators to ripen
</p>
<p>their murderous projects into maturity without letting the least
</p>
<p>index of them appear. It then happens that the public danger
</p>
<p>becomes, all at once, manifest, and that the State is delivered over
</p>
<p>to general conflagration, before it is possible to acquire material
</p>
<p>proofs against the guilty parties. At such a crisis, in which every
</p>
<p>thing announces the existence of imminent perils, is it not pru
</p>
<p>dent, is it not just, to spare the people the hazards of an intestine
</p>
<p>war, by using severity against the parties whose passions, aristo
</p>
<p>cratic habits, and anti-social interests, manifestly place them out of
</p>
<p>the pale of the popular sovereignty? At a juncture of this kind,
</p>
<p>the salvation of the whole depends on the terror inspired into the
</p>
<p>wicked, by the rapidity with which the thunder of national justice

<p>Smites a few guilty heads. It is extremely probably that a single

</p>
<p>Leblanc, afterwards a Commissary of the Directory at
</p>
<p>Saint Domingo, and Claude Fiquet.*
</p>
<p>* Bread and the Constitution of 1793 were at this period the
</p>
<p>rallying cries of the people of Paris, who were justly alarmed for
</p>
<p>their rights and for their subsistence. As to the latter (the
</p>
<p>Constitution) their fears were but too well-founded, for it was to
</p>
<p>the annihilation of the Constitution of 1793 that the efforts of the
</p>
<p>ruling party of the Convention then visibly tended.
</p>
<p>With respectto subsistence, never had the Parisiens experienced
</p>
<p>a more cruel famine than this, although the harvest had been most
</p>
<p>abundant, and the rural districts presented the most flattering
</p>
<p>appearance. From whence proceeded, then, this frightful famine
</p>
<p>which cut short the lives of so many citizens ? From the retrograde
</p>
<p>march of the Convention, from the cunning of the aristocracy, and
</p>
<p>from the avarice of the rich.
</p>
<p>For a considerable time before, it had been found necessary, in
</p>
<p>order to defeat the criminal manoeuvres of the aristocracy, seconded
</p>
<p>as they were, by the avarice of the middle classes, to impose a tax
</p>
<p>on provisions  to force those that were in possession of them to
</p>
<p>stock the markets, and maintain by severe measures the circulation
</p>
<p>of paper-money (assignats) at its nominal value. After the 9th
</p>
<p>Thermidor, the requisitions and the taxes having been on a sudden
</p>
<p>interdicted, and the paper money abandoned to the unrestricted
</p>
<p>speculations of commerce, the price of commodities rose so high
</p>
<p>that at last there was no possibility of procuring provisions with
</p>
<p>out metallic money. The consequence was, that the mass of la
</p>
<p>bourers, who were destitute of money of that kind, were reduced
</p>
<p>to absolute starvation in the midst of abundance.
</p>
<p>At the very height of the people's sufferings the ruling party
</p>
<p>never ceased to assure them that their subsistence should be
</p>
<p>provided tor ! Its policy was to stuff the people with promises
</p>
<p>of future abundance and prosperity, on condition of unqualified
</p>
<p>submission on the part of the latter ! Such was the price to be
</p>
<p>paid for their fatal docility. It is only by the circumstances under

<p>which they are established that one can judge rightly of the merit
</p>
<p>of institutions, and of the intentions of the framers of them.
</p>
<p>[In corroboration of the truth of what Buonarroti here states
</p>
<p>respecting the schemes of the aristocracy and middle classes to
</p>
<p>subdue the friends of equality by famine, I beg attention to the
</p>
<p>following passage in Mignet's History of the French Revolution.
</p>
<p>Mignet was ho friend of the working classes, and therefore his
</p>
<p>testimony is the more valuable in the present instance. Speaking
</p>
<p>of theevents justalludedto, he says:  " They (the assignats) were
</p>
<p>received with reluctance, and cash, as it was the more sought
</p>
<p>after, was so much the more carefully hoarded up, and the value of
</p>
<p>paper-mnney still further decreased. The people wanting pro
</p>
<p>visions, and not having the power, even with assignats, of purchas
</p>
<p>ing them, were reduced to great distress ; they attributed it to the
</p>
<p>merchants, to the contractors, to the landlords, to the Government

<p>general and furious was this proscription, that amongst

<p>tue citizens, precipitated in thousands into the prisons of
</p>
<p>Paris, there were many indifferent persons, and not a
</p>
<p>few that were even opposed to the triumph of the party
</p>
<p>to which they were accused of belonging.
</p>
<p>These prisons were at that time the Manners and
</p>
<p>scene of a spectacle as affecting as it was occupations of
</p>
<p>singularly new. The victims, whom the f^d
</p>
<p>aristocracy had plunged into them, lived
</p>
<p>frugally in the most intimate fraternity, honoured one
</p>
<p>another for their chains and poverty, devoted themselves
</p>
<p>to work and study, and conversed only on the calamities
</p>
<p>of their common country, and on the means of bringing
</p>
<p>th?m to an end. The civic songs with which, chaunting
</p>
<p>simultaneously, they made the air resound, caused to
</p>
<p>congregate every evening around these dismal abodes a
</p>
<p>crowd of citizens, whom curiosity attracted there, or the
</p>
<p>congeniality of their sentiments with those of the prisoners.
</p>
<p>It was natural that men of this stamp, burning with
</p>
<p>patriotism, inflamed bv persecution, and confirmed in
</p>
<p>their common sentiments, by long and frequent inter
</p>
<p>communication, should be disposed to hazard every
</p>
<p>thing to restore the principles of the Revolution, and to

<p>attain at last the end of their steadfast wishes. Ac

<p>56 babeuf's CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>IV , Babeuf,* Darthe, Buonarroti, Laurgen de Doimel,
</p>
<p>and Fontenelle, exerted themselves to form a centre of
</p>
<p>direction, at which the scattered patriots might rally, to the
</p>
<p>end of afterwards acting uniformly to the profit of the
</p>
<p>BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF BABEUF.
</p>
<p>* Gracchus Babeuf was born at-.St. Quentin, Department of
</p>
<p>l'Aine. He was a man of sense, well-informed, and indefatigable ;
</p>
<p>his mind was penetrating and just ; he wrote with clearness, fire,
</p>
<p>and eloquence.
</p>
<p>The French Revolution found Babeuf young, devoted to study,
</p>
<p>sober, detesting tyranny, and meditating on the means of rescuing
</p>
<p>his unhappy fellow-citizens from oppression ; he experienced at
</p>
<p>an early period the necessity of devoting himself for the public
</p>
<p>liberty. In the beginning of the Revolution Babeuf wrote in the
</p>
<p>spirit of a freeman against the feudal regime, and against the sys
</p>
<p>tem of finance, which drew down upon him persecution, and an
</p>
<p>order of arrest, from the effects of which he was saved by the
</p>
<p>active solicitations of Marat. At a later period he obtained the
</p>
<p>post of Secretary to a District Administration, where his discourses
</p>
<p>and popular writings made him numerous enemies, who had in
</p>
<p>fluence enough to get him prosecuted and condemned as a forger of
</p>
<p>writings or signatures (faussaire) ; but the judgment against him
</p>
<p>was annulled by the Convention, which solemnly declared its
</p>
<p>injustice. Subsequently, Babeuf got employment in the Bureaux
</p>
<p>of the Commune of Paris, where he formed a friendly connexion
</p>
<p>with a great number of courageous Republicans.
</p>
<p>After the disastrous events of the 9th Thermidor, Babeuf ap
</p>
<p>plauded for a moment the indulgence exercised towards the enemies
</p>
<p>of the Revolution ; his error did not last long  and he, who had
</p>
<p>adopted the Gracchi for the models of his conduct, was not slow
</p>
<p>in perceiving that nothing could less resemble these illustrious
</p>
<p>Romans than the Post-Thermidorian rulers  the murderers of
</p>
<p>Robespierre. Greater than if he had never erred, Babeuf owned
</p>
<p>his mistake, reclaimed for the people its ravished rights, unmasked
</p>
<p>the parties by whom it had been deceived, and carried his zeal for

</p>
<p>the democracy so far, that the aristocrats then in possession of the
</p>
<p>Government lost no time in sending him to prison. From tho
</p>
<p>Gaol of Plessis, where he was at first detained, they transferred
</p>
<p>him to that of Arras. It was then he got acquainted with Germain
</p>
<p>of Narbonne, Captain of Hussars, of whom frequent mention will
</p>
<p>be made in the course of this work, and with several Republicans
</p>
<p>of the Department of Pas-de-Calais. Amongst these, Babeuf was
</p>
<p>an indefatigable preacher of popular institutions ; he inflamed
</p>
<p>: their hatred against the new tyrannies ; he familiarised them with
</p>
<p>the idea of a great revolution in property, and disposed them to
</p>
<p>form a sort of plebeian Vendue, for the purpose of obtaining by
</p>
<p>force, what it appeared to him no longer possible to obtain by any
</p>
<p>other means.
</p>
<p>Upon his return to the Plessis, after the insurrection of Prairial
</p>
<p>of the Year III., Babeuf was entirely occupied with the like pro
</p>
<p>jects which his frequent conversations with certain citizens, then
</p>
<p>imprisoned with him, aided him to mature. It was then he
</p>
<p>made the acquaintance of Bedon, whose real name I regret not

</p>
<p>common cause. In the meetings which took place to this
</p>
<p>effect, several propositions were made ; some wished that
</p>
<p>all the sincere patriots should be incorporated into a sort
</p>
<p>of masonic association, to act in obedience to certain
</p>
<p>directors they proposed to appoint over it ; others sug-
</p>
<p>beiag able to give  of Bedon, who, having passed his whole life in
</p>
<p>examining the causes of public evils, had seized, better than any
</p>
<p>body else, the spirit of Robespierre's profound views. ^-
</p>
<p>It will be seen in the sequel of this work how the ideas of
</p>
<p>Babeuf expanded, and how large a shaTe he had in the conspiracy
</p>
<p>to which his name is attached. This extraordinnry man, gifted
</p>
<p>witheminenttalents, the inflexible friend of justice, was constantly *-
</p>
<p>disinterested and poor ; a good husband, a tender father ; he was
</p>
<p>beloved by his family. The courage with which, in the presence
</p>
<p>of his judges, he appalled the powerful monsters that demanded
</p>
<p>his head, and the loity serenity with which he faced the glorious
</p>
<p>death inflicted on him by the aristocracy, heighten the lustre of
</p>
<p>his virtues, and shed a s.inctity on the patriotic labours of this_>
</p>
<p>illustrious martyr of equality.
</p>
<p>[Notwithstanding this glowing eulogium  an eulogium so justly
</p>
<p>earned by the individual, and to which no human being can be
</p>
<p>entitled that holds other principles than those of Babeuf  there
</p>
<p>are not wanting villains to vilify and blacken the character of this
</p>
<p>" noble of nature." I remember reading in one aristocratic account
</p>
<p>of him, that he was an "insane monster;" and in another, that during
</p>
<p>his provincial secretaryship " he exhibited all the little tricks of
</p>
<p>a low pettifogger!" My readers will, doubtless, stare at these
</p>
<p>representations, so utterly at variance with facts, and with the
</p>
<p>whole history of Babeufs life ; but, be it observed, that the authors
</p>
<p>of such calumnies would have given the same character of Jesus
</p>
<p>Christ himself, had his Gospel appeared for the first time at the
</p>
<p>period to which this history refers. In truth, the doctrines of
</p>
<p>Babeuf are as nearly as possible (making allowance for different
</p>
<p>epochs and circumstances) the same that our Saviour preached
</p>
<p>18 centuries ago; while the murderers of Babeuf present just as

<p>close a resemblance to the parties that crucified our Saviour. The
</p>
<p>aristocracy andusurers of France called Babeuf a " bloody fanatic,"
</p>
<p>and his doctrines " anarchical, wild, and desolating." The same
</p>
<p>character was given of our Saviour by the Jews and money
</p>
<p>changers that murdered him, and his religion was denounced by
</p>
<p>the aristocratic Tacitus as a " destructive superstition (eiitiabilis
</p>
<p>superstitio).[$>ee his Annals, book xv., cap. 44.] Mrs. Wool-
</p>
<p>stonecraft, who knew Babeuf well, declared that she " had never
</p>
<p>seen any person who possessed greater abilities, or equal strength
</p>
<p>of character." And this is the " fanatic " and " low pettifogger"
</p>
<p>of the aristocrats but wait a little, my friends, and you will

<p>gested that they might at any moment constitute them
</p>
<p>selves into a committee of insurrection, by an act signed
</p>
<p>individually by each of the members. As in these
</p>
<p>assemblies there was neither uniformity of views, nor the
</p>
<p>confidence necessary to obtain a useful result, they could
</p>
<p>come to no mutual understanding, and so they soon
</p>
<p>ceased to meet.
</p>
<p>They did not, however, renounce the two-fold project
</p>
<p>of rallying the patriots, and of overthrowing tyranny.
</p>
<p>These were imperious wants for every true Republican.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, they assembled again a short time after,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of establishing a new popular society.
</p>
<p>At the first sitting, which was held at the house of
</p>
<p>Bouin, there were present, amongst others  Darthe,*

<p>* BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF DARTHE.
</p>
<p>Augustin Alexander Darfhi, of Saint Paul, Department of Pas-
</p>
<p>de-Calais, was well-informed, just, bold, constant, active, inflexible,
</p>
<p>and very expert in unravelling and interesting in his views the
</p>
<p>passions of the parties he had to deal with. He was a law student
</p>
<p>at Paris when the Revolution broke out, and he precipitated him
</p>
<p>self into it, with the zeal of a man who defends truth to desperation,
</p>
<p>when once its light shines upon him. In 1789 Darthe took part
</p>
<p>in the deliverance of the French Guards, in the taking of the Bastile
</p>
<p>(where he contracted an incurable infirmity), and at the siege of the
</p>
<p>Castle of Vincennes. He was afterwards member of the Directory
</p>
<p>of his Department, and in this capacity rendered to the Republic,
</p>
<p>under very critical circumstances, services so important, that he
</p>
<p>was rewarded for them by a decree of " bien meritt de la patrie" (he
</p>
<p>deserved well of his country). Having been subsequently pro
</p>
<p>moted to the office of public accuser before the Revolutionary
</p>
<p>Tribunals of Arras and Cambrai, to the severity of which was
</p>
<p>owing, in great part, the preservation of this frontier, he approved
</p>
<p>himself a true Republican, an incorruptible magistrate, as well as
</p>
<p>an intrepid warrior. The Thermidorian proscription, which he
</p>
<p>could not escape, found him in honourable poverty. At an early

<p>period, Darthe penetrated, and seconded with all his power, the
</p>
<p>benevolent designs of Robespierre ; accordingly, as Robespierre
</p>
<p>had shown the greatest esteem for Darthe, the enemies of equality
</p>
<p>vowed implacable vengeance against him.
</p>
<p>To great intelligence, and a lively passion for true justice,
</p>
<p>Darthe united austere manners and a compassionate heart. When
</p>
<p>on his trial, before the High Court of Vendome, he perseveringly
</p>
<p>refused to acknowledge its jurisdiction, or to offer any defence 
</p>
<p>when condemned to death, his last sighs were for his country.
</p>
<p>[With the exceptions of Robespierre, Marat, and a few others,
</p>
<p>there is none whose character has suffered more from calumny
</p>
<p>than Darthe. If we are to believe the aristocratic accounts of
</p>
<p>him, his table-companion was the executioner, and his wit and
</p>
<p>conversation all turned upon the guillotine. One caricature of him

<p>Germain, Buonarroti, Massart, Fontenelle, Lihppi, Laur-

<p>says, that when on his mission as public accuser in the North, he
</p>
<p>would not suffer the cart of basket-work, in which the bodies
</p>
<p>were brought from the guillotine to be lined, as usual, with tin,
</p>
<p>because " he wished that its track of blood should be seen in the streets."
</p>
<p>Another account accuses him of having sacrificed " whole families
</p>
<p>to his private malice  of brutal licentiousness  of fraud and rapacity ;"
</p>
<p>and so forth through the whole circle of crime. Such are the
</p>
<p>horrid inventions by which democracy, or (which is the same)

<p>* Bertrand, of Lyons, was Mayor of that Commune before the
</p>
<p>revolt which took place there on the 29th of May, 1793, and again
</p>
<p>after its forced submission to the laws of the Convention. Ber
</p>
<p>trand had exhausted an opulent fortune in favour of the Revolu
</p>
<p>tion ; he was just, loyal (not to the king), generous, full of courage
</p>
<p>and amenity ; his manners were simple, and candour was depicted
</p>
<p>on his countenance.
</p>
<p>The rich Lyonese were reserving for Bertrand the same fate to
</p>
<p>which they had devoted his friend Charlier ; their efforts were
</p>
<p>vain, for the people responding aloud, by sobs and benedictions to
</p>
<p>the interruptions with which Bertrand reminded them of his
</p>
<p>sacrifices, and of the services he had rendered the unfortunate,
</p>
<p>the judges about to immolate him were, on several resumptions of
</p>
<p>the trial, constrained to adjourn the sentence, and to send him
</p>
<p>back to his dungeon, where he remained during the long siege of
</p>
<p>his Commune. On the very day of the 9th Thermidor, the order
</p>
<p>was issued to seize and transmit to Paris Bertrand, and several '
</p>
<p>other Lyonese Democrats. So strongly were their purity and firm
</p>
<p>ness resented, that their chains were not struck off till after the
</p>
<p>13th Vendemiaire of the Year IV.

</p>
<p>of the closely-observing patriots, who, ^riot^ a,nd of
</p>
<p>having witnessed, on the 13th Vende
</p>
<p>miaire, the fruitless squandering of the people's blood,
</p>
<p>were confirmed in the opinion that nothing of substantial
</p>
<p>use could emanate from the new Government.
</p>
<p>The democratic party was not numerous, and the
</p>
<p>mass of the patriots feeble, and scarcely recovered from
</p>
<p>their fright, were disposed to suffer themselves to be
</p>
<p>again intimidated at the least appearance of a new per
</p>
<p>secution. As to the people of Paris, deceived in its
</p>
<p>hopes, deluded by calumny, and by the underhand plots
</p>
<p>of Royalism, and of the foreign despots, it had aban
</p>
<p>doned the Democrats, and languished in profound in
</p>
<p>difference. There were some that even accused the
</p>
<p>Revolution of the evils, without number, that pressed
</p>
<p>them down.
</p>
<p>The citizens, assembled in the garden Prudence of the

<p>of St. Genevieve, felt the dangers to funds' of

<p>exposed those that, by a premature zeal, might dare to

<p>necessary to rectify the ideas of many of the patriots,

<p>regain for them the esteem of the people, and restore to

</p>
<p>of intriguers, and of the enemies of the Republic. To
</p>
<p>this unique society they proposed to invite none but men
</p>
<p>without reproach, and capable of being easily and fami
</p>
<p>liarly inspired with the prudence adopted by its founders.

<p>Foundation of The society was immediately opened in
</p>
<p>the society of the ancient refectory of the nuns of St.
</p>
<p>the Pantheon. Genevieve, of which the patriotic Cardi-
</p>
<p>naux, who rented a part of their convent, granted the
</p>
<p>gratuitous use ; and whenever this apartment was conse
</p>
<p>crated to meetings of another kind, the society was held in
</p>
<p>a vast vault of the same edifice (probably a crypt), where
</p>
<p>the dim paleness of the torch-light, the hollow echoes of
</p>
<p>their voices, and the constrained position of the persons
</p>
<p>present, either standing or seated on the ground, im
</p>
<p>pressed on them the greatness and the perils of their
</p>
<p>enterprize, as well as of the courage and prudence it
</p>
<p>required. The proximity of this place to the Pantheon
</p>
<p>caused the new society to be called by the name of this
</p>
<p>temple. The assembly once opened, its numbers rapidly
</p>
<p>increased by the accession of a great number of patriots
</p>
<p>invited to attend, or induced there by the attractions of
</p>
<p>the institution. With these, other individuals insinuated
</p>
<p>themselves, who, servilely attached to the members of the
</p>
<p>Government, reduced all the duties of the friends of
</p>
<p>liberty to the single one of lending their support to the
</p>
<p>Government against the Royalists.*

</p>
<p>to overcome. Fearing to offer any resemblance to the
</p>
<p>old societies,! their prudence went beyond even the

<p>restore the democracy, by getting possession of the pub-

</p>
<p>aristocratic writers were sounding the alarm against the
</p>
<p>new attempts of the " Terrorists," as they called them,
</p>
<p>Babeuf resolutely unveiled, in his journal' (the Tribune
</p>
<p>of the People), the crimes of the rulers of the Republic,
</p>
<p>demonstrated the goodness and the legitimacy of the
</p>
<p>Constitution of 1793, and did not hesitate to sigualize
</p>
<p>private or individual property as the principal source of
</p>
<p>all the calamities that oppress and afflict society. Such
</p>
<p>extraordinary courage soon drew down upon him a fresh
</p>
<p>proscription, which he was only able to elude by seeking
</p>
<p>an obscure asylum in the houses of certain Democrats.*
</p>
<p>At the same time a secret Committee r m tt
</p>
<p>was formed at the house of Amar, in the the house of
</p>
<p>street Clery, to prepare an insurrection Amar.
</p>
<p>against the new despotism, which, more and more, every
</p>
<p>day, was crushing the French people under its iron arm.
</p>
<p>The earlier members of the Committee were Amar,
</p>
<p>Darthe, Buonarroti, Massart, and Germain, who were
</p>
<p>subsequently joined by Bedon, Soigne, Felix Le-
</p>
<p>pelletier, Clement, and Marchand. The intense grief
</p>
<p>with which they were penetrated, carried the friends of
</p>
<p>liberty, as it were, by inspiration, to combine their forces
</p>
<p>against the hateful yoke that weighed down the people.

<p>As to the enlightened Democrats, they believed it an

<p>imperious duty.

</p>
<p>to arrest him, on account of the incentives to insurrection con
</p>
<p>tained in his writings, Babeuf, after a long struggle, broke loose
</p>
<p>and effected his escape. The officer pursued him with cries of

<p>salvation of the Republic and of Liberty imperiously
</p>
<p>commanded its destruction.
</p>
<p>Before occupying themselves with the means of effect
</p>
<p>ing this, it was the wish of all that each member might
</p>
<p>be not only convinced of the justice of the enterprise,
</p>
<p>but that he should also have formed a clear and complete
</p>
<p>idea of the political system he would substitute for the
</p>
<p>one whose annihilation was contemplated.* They sin

<p>cerely desired the happiness of the people ; and with this

<p>impression, they felt that it was contrary to its (the

<p>people's) true interests to rashly expose it to convulsions,
</p>
<p>the only result of which might be to build up a new
</p>
<p>tyranny on the ruins of the existing one, to create new

<p>was, at first, a sort of political Lyceum, or school,- in

<p>which, after unravelling the causes of the calamities that

<p>afflict nations, they at length arrived at the knowledge

</p>
<p>And then turning their regards to the French nation,
</p>
<p>they beheld it, as it were, bound hand and foot by the
</p>
<p>conquering or upstart Egoists, in bondage to the corpo
</p>
<p>ration of the Old Rich and the New Rich.
</p>
<p>As to the cause of these disorders, they discovered it
</p>
<p>in the mequalitv of fortunes and conditions, and (as the
</p>
<p>last step of the analysis) in the system of individual pro
</p>
<p>perty, by which the craftiest, least conscientious, and
</p>
<p>luckiest, have despoiled, and incessantly despoil the
</p>
<p>multitude ; who., bound down to wearisome and painful

</p>
<p>by despair, both in their physical and moral strength,
</p>
<p>behold in society only a deadly enemy, and lose even
</p>
<p>the possibility of having a country.
</p>
<p>The history of the Revolution came opportunely .to the
</p>
<p>aid of the Committee's reflections. In that history they
</p>
<p>beheld the class that was rich before, and that which
</p>
<p>became rich, assiduously occupied in insuring pre
</p>
<p>eminence for themselves. They saw in it, that ambitious
</p>
<p>pretensions went always hand in hand with hatred of
</p>
<p>work and the desire of riches ; that the people's attach
</p>
<p>ment to their rights of citizenship had become less and
</p>
<p>less ardent, in proportion as the institutions favourable to
</p>
<p>equality had been assaulted and overborne ; and that
</p>
<p>the whole system of aristocratic policy consisted in im
</p>
<p>poverishing, dividing, disgusting, terrifying, and com
</p>
<p>pressing the laborious classes, whose cries and remon
</p>
<p>strances they uniformly represent as the most active
</p>
<p>causes of the decay of society. ; From these observations
</p>
<p>the Committee were necessarily led to conclude, that the

</p>
<p>tirely in the inequality of condition, and that,\so long as

<p>of the Progressive Impost, adopted it only as a means to an end ;
</p>
<p>and as the best means which the then state of public opinion would
</p>
<p>sanction, of providing for the wants of the Republic at the ex

<p>notwithstanding the immense consumption required by so extra

</p>
<p>occasioned by it, the people and the armies were well fed and
</p>
<p>abundantly provided for. What a contrast to the state of France
</p>
<p>two years after ! After the murder of Robespierre, and under the

<p>Directory, France, instead of a workshop of war, became a work

<p>hundreds of famine, and there was hardly a man or woman of them
</p>
<p>whose effects were not all pawned at the Mont de Viitt. How is
</p>
<p>this apparent paradox to be accounted for ? With infinite ease, my

<p>and that the equality suggested by their own simple
</p>
<p>good sense to the first founders of societies, is still more
</p>
<p>strongly recommended to us by the increase of our know
</p>
<p>ledge and by our everyday experience of the evils that
</p>
<p>follow in the train of inequality. Those who reasoned
</p>
<p>thus, saw in the community of goods and of labours 
</p>
<p>that is to say, in the equal distribution of burdens and
</p>
<p>enjoyments  the veritable object and perfection of the
</p>
<p>social state  the only public order adequate to banish
</p>
<p>oppression for ever, by rendering the ravages of ambition
</p>
<p>and avarice impossible, and to guarantee to each and
</p>
<p>every citizen the greatest possible happiness. Bedon
</p>
<p>had composed a work in which he demonstrated the
</p>
<p>injustice of the right of property, and developed the long
</p>
<p>series of evils that are its necessary consequences.
</p>
<p>Amar appeared smitten, as it were, by a beam of
</p>
<p>light. At the first enunciation of this system he became
</p>
<p>its enthusiastic defender ; and no longer thinking of
</p>
<p>aught else than to justify and propagate its principles,
</p>
<p>he carried in a short time the heat of his zeal so far as
</p>
<p>to become its impetuous champion in public. It became
</p>
<p>an admitted principle in the Committee that the laws of
</p>
<p>liberty and equality could never receive a useful and
</p>
<p>durable application without a radical reform in the pro
</p>
<p>perty system ; it was agreed that the patriots would only
</p>
<p>appear in the eyes of the multitude a set of restless and
</p>
<p>selfish intriguers, so long as they would not openly avow
</p>
<p>themselves supporters of a system suited to guarantee

<p>palpably the same advantages to every member of society.

<p>on the 9th Thermidor had been one of his most violent

<p>more in unison with their ideas than they appear to have thought.

<p>When Robespierre proposes to secure to every citizen whatever pro

<p>On the other hand, they considered that to this Consti

<p>tution would rally not only the Equals, but also the De

</p>
<p>the people; that all further changes would become
</p>
<p>easier as soon as the spirit of equality had resumed its
</p>
<p>energy ; and, besides, that it would be hazarding too
</p>
<p>great a danger to expose themselves to divergences of
</p>
<p>opinion, at a moment when it was indispensable to unite

<p>all the popular forces, in order to attack the common

<p>enemy with success.
</p>
<p>After a long and serious examination, Rallying points
</p>
<p>the Committee reduced the duties of the R^kW
</p>
<p>people to these two cardinal points : 
</p>
<p>1. To re-establish the Constitution of 1793, agreed to
</p>
<p>by the people, as a fundamental law which frankly con
</p>
<p>secrates the exercise of its power  a prompt means of
</p>
<p>arriving at equality  a rallying point necessary to over
</p>
<p>throw the existing authority, convicted of tyranny. 2. To
</p>
<p>prepare, in the distance, for the adoption of a veritable
</p>
<p>equality, by demonstrating it to the people as the only
</p>
<p>effectual means of drying up for ever all the sources of
</p>
<p>public calamity.
</p>
<p>The Revolution contemplated being to Authority to be

<p>commence by the destruction of the Con- the Govern/"
</p>
<p>stitution of the Year III., the Committee mentofthe
</p>
<p>naturally occupied itself with the means ^ear ***
</p>
<p>the sovereign people ; so that if the guarantees of property (esta
</p>
<p>blished by law) were at any time found mischievous or inconve
</p>
<p>nient, they might be remedied by the same authority that controlled
</p>
<p>the law itself. The more Robespierre's Declaration is considered
</p>
<p>the clearer will appear its perfect adaptation to any or to every
</p>
<p>social order that the most enlarged and comprehensive benevolence
</p>
<p>can contemplate. Robert Owen does not go one jot farther than
</p>
<p>Robespierre's Declaration would sanction. Without the people's

<p>should be equally accessible to them. Now, this is the gTand
</p>
<p>point conceded by Robespierre's Declaration, and in that, there
</p>
<p>fore, consists its surpassing excellence. It is true, the Declaration

<p>agreed to by the Convention differs in some respects from Robes

<p>of operation, and with the provisional Government, to
</p>
<p>be suddenly substituted for the one they sought to over
</p>
<p>throw. The necessities of the case, and the very success
</p>
<p>of the enterprize, evidently required that there should be
</p>
<p>an interval between the fall of the aristocratic Govern
</p>
<p>ment and the definitive establishment of the popular
</p>
<p>Constitution. It was only by the people's force they
</p>
<p>proposed attacking the usurped authority ; and this
</p>
<p>force they counted on putting in action, only by the
</p>
<p>ascendancy of truth, by the love of liberty, and by the
</p>
<p>people's hatred of oppression.
</p>
<p>Before I resume (in the course of this work) the sub
</p>
<p>ject of the form of provisional authority, by which the
</p>
<p>conspirators proposed to themselves, to suddenly replace
</p>
<p>the Constitutional Order of the Year III., I will here
</p>
<p>briefly expound the several opinions that divided the
</p>
<p>Committee. One party proposed to recal the remnant of the
</p>
<p>National Convention, which they regarded as still ex
</p>
<p>isting by right ; another party wished to confide the
</p>
<p>Provisional Government of the Republic to a body
</p>
<p>named on the spot by the people of Paris, in insurrec
</p>
<p>tion ; others, again, were inclined to invest for a limited
</p>
<p>period a single individual, under the title of dictator or
</p>
<p>regulator, with the supreme power and charge of settling
</p>
<p>the Republic. By-and-bye will be seen the reasons by
</p>
<p>which each supported his opinion. Suffice it for the
</p>
<p>present to state, that the opinion in favour of nominating
</p>
<p>the Provisional Government, by the insurgents of Paris,
</p>
<p>was preferred to the recal of the Convention proposed
</p>
<p>by Amar, and to the Dictatorship suggested by Bedon.
</p>
<p>Whilst the Committee was ripening its projects, the
</p>
<p>Society of the Pantheon, and the writings of Babeuf,
</p>
<p>served it, as levers, for the contemplated movement. To
</p>
<p>the end of directing their action, it whispered the orators
</p>
<p>of the Society (which they calculated on making the

</p>
<p>premature explosions, without subduing the Society's
</p>
<p>energy ; and it encouraged Babeuf to redouble his zeal
</p>
<p>against the oppressors, and to summon the people without

</p>

</p>
<p>when the demon of distrust interposed to damp the
</p>
<p>labours of the Committee, which, in consequence, soon
</p>
<p>dissolved itself. Amar became the object Dissolution of

<p>of general distrust ; he was equally odious the Committee.

<p>to many of the friends of equality, as to the partisans of
</p>
<p>the aristocracy. The latter reproached him with the
</p>
<p>part he had taken in the persecutions against the
</p>
<p>Girondists, and the severity he had displayed against
</p>
<p>the enemies of the Repubhc ; the former accused him of
</p>
<p>having been one of the most violent proscribers of the vic
</p>
<p>tims of the 9th Thermidor, towards whom, it was alleged,
</p>
<p>he had exercised revolting traits of cruelty  they called
</p>
<p>him vain, imprudent, intriguing, and revengeful. But
</p>
<p>he had been able to gain the confidence of Darthe and
</p>
<p>of Massart, and it was owing to them that the other
</p>
<p>members of the Committee associated with him. Though
</p>
<p>induced, however, to act with Amar, by their ardent
</p>
<p>desire to serve the cause of the people, and by the
</p>
<p>opinion they had of the sincerity of the zeal he mani
</p>
<p>fested, they were soon estranged from him by bitter
</p>
<p>recollections, by the very eagerness with which he had

<p>declared himself for the system of equality, and even by

<p>the unjust fear of being betrayed by him.

<p>Afterwards followed discussions on legislation, and on
</p>
<p>the proceedings of Government, propositions, and the
</p>
<p>examining of addresses, to present to the authorities.
</p>
<p>From the lively debates that took place, there were
</p>
<p>frequent opportunities of ascertaining the generous sen
</p>
<p>timents of the parties that aspired to restore to the
</p>
<p>78 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>people the plenitude of its rights, and the selfish and
</p>
<p>narrow views of other parties that only aimed at making
</p>
<p>the Society the pedestal of an odious domination.
</p>
<p>Amongst the remarkable events that transpired in this
</p>
<p>Society, the two following merit particular notice.
</p>
<p>Previously to the 9th Thermidor of the
</p>
<p>ttttXsof Year II., two laws had laid the ground-
</p>
<p>the country of a work of a great reform in the distribution
</p>
<p>uWwortW of territorial wealth. By the first, a
</p>
<p>national pro- thousand millions' worth of national pro
</p>
<p>perty, petty had been promised to the defenders
</p>
<p>of the country. By the second, the goods of the ene
</p>
<p>mies of the Revolution were allotted to distressed pa
</p>
<p>triots.* Almost all the Pantheonists considered the
</p>
<p>execution of the first as a mere debt of gratitude ; but
</p>
<p>those most devoted to the cause of equality saw in it be
</p>
<p>sides, a first step towards arriving at the vigorous execu
</p>
<p>tion of the second, and designed to familiarize the
</p>
<p>nation with the principle which places in the hand of the
</p>
<p>sovereign the right of disposing of all property ; they felt,
</p>
<p>moreover, that it was only by discussions of this kind
</p>
<p>they could awake in the people that energy which had
</p>
<p>enabled it to work such prodigies, and without which
</p>
<p>all efforts to establish a reasonable social order would be
</p>
<p>vain. Accordingly, the proposition for demanding the effec
</p>
<p>tive distribution of the thousand millions was received
</p>
<p>with transport, and the address containing the demand
</p>
<p>was at first adopted without any modification. The
</p>
<p>transmission of it, however, was, at a subsequent sitting,
</p>
<p>adjourned sine die, through the influence of certain
</p>
<p>agents of the Government, who succeeded in replunging
</p>
<p>the majority of the members of the society into that state
</p>
<p>of alarm from which they had just scarcely emerged.+

<p>t The national domains, appropriated or mortgaged from the
</p>
<p>commencement for the extinction of the old national debt, repre
</p>
<p>sented for a time by the dividends or annuities on the State, and
</p>
<p>more recently represented by the paper-money, known under the
</p>
<p>name of assignats, were horribly dilapidated, when, after the 9th
</p>
<p>Thermidor, it was permitted to purchase them without public
</p>
<p>auction, by simple contract or subscription, and to pay the price
</p>
<p>of them in papor which had now scarcely more than a nominal
</p>
<p>babeuf's conspiracy. 79
</p>
<p>The boldness with which Babeuf at- interest of the
</p>
<p>tacked, in his Tribune of the People, the Society for
</p>
<p>Constitution in force, and the members Bal)euf-
</p>
<p>of the Government, was the cause of the rigorous si
</p>
<p>lence for a long time observed respecting him by the
</p>
<p>Society of the Pantheon. Those that approved his
</p>
<p>opinions were apprehensive of losing- all by precipitation
</p>
<p> the timid ones were afraid to compromise themselves
</p>
<p> the enemies of Babeuf's doctrine had a cautious fear
</p>
<p>of giving him importance. At the commencement of
</p>
<p>Ventose of the Year IV., the proscription impendings
</p>
<p>over Babeuf reached his wife ; she was arrested upon a
</p>
<p>charge of having distributed the writings of her husband,
</p>
<p>but the real motive of the proceeeding was to ascertain
</p>
<p>from her her husband's secret retreat. At the mention
</p>
<p>of this excess of cruelty the Pantheon resounded with a
</p>
<p>thousand cries of indignation ; the friends of equality
</p>
<p>raised their voice in favour of the courageous Babeuf;
</p>
<p>value, since the recent examination and report on the state of the
</p>
<p>currency. Hence, as well as from the brigandism of the commis
</p>
<p>saries for victualling the armies, arose those colossal fortunes, and
</p>
<p>that unbridled luxury, which afterwards contributed so powerfully
</p>
<p>towards the total ruin of the Republic.
</p>
<p>The Pantheonists represented in their address, that if this dis
</p>
<p>order continued ever so little longer, there would not remain a
</p>
<p>single rood of ground to discharge the debt contracted with the
</p>
<p>defenders of the country. Already had Robespierre complained,
</p>
<p>in his last discourses, of the partiality shown to the rich rentiers
</p>
<p>in detriment to the poor, and especially of the Finance Committee,
</p>
<p>for suffering to be squandered the mass of national property re
</p>
<p>served for the people.
</p>
<p>[Do you, my friends, begin to see why Robespierre was mur
</p>
<p>dered? Alas! what a liar is history ! Knaves pretend, and fools
</p>
<p>believe, that he perished because he was a tyrant, but the knaves

<p>so much glory  the spirit of equality which was spread

<p>ing all over France  this new impulse towards demo
</p>
<p>cracy  and, above all, the well-known character of the
</p>
<p>leaders of the Pantheon  had unchained against this
</p>
<p>Society all the anti-popular writers of Paris, to whom
</p>
<p>were joined several orators of the Council of Five Hun
</p>
<p>dred. The Government, which originally applauded
</p>
<p>its institution, in the design of using it as a bugbear
</p>
<p>against the Royalists, were already alarmed at its pro
</p>
<p>gress and influence. Accordingly, the secret agents of
</p>
<p>tyranny, seconded by the timidity oT weak men, soon
</p>
<p>paralysed the energy of the Society, by sowing terror in
</p>
<p>its body. At one time they represented a band of Aris
</p>
<p>tocrats as ready to assail it with armed force ; at another
</p>
<p>they presented to its vision the vengeance of the Govern
</p>
<p>ment, exasperated by the alleged boldness of its dis
</p>
<p>cussions. As to remedies, however, they proposed none
</p>
<p>but acts of submission and protestations of attachment
</p>
<p>to the new-established system. Induced by such coun
</p>
<p>sels, the Society was made to propose an address to the
</p>
<p>Executive Directory,.jn which, after a thousand base
</p>
<p>flatteries, it was led to swear fidelity to the Constitntion
</p>
<p>of the Year III. The address was vehemently opposed,
</p>
<p>but, having been adopted by the majoriry, it became the
</p>
<p>ground of an open schism between those that signed it

<p>and the sworn Democrats, who preferred the hazards of

<p>clothes, were languishing in extreme misery, or absolutely
</p>
<p>dying of inanition. A petition of the Pantheonists di
</p>
<p>rected the notice of the legislative body to this appalling
</p>
<p>disorder. Another petition refuted the sophisms by which certain
</p>
<p>malignant members of the Legislature had called for
</p>
<p>restrictions on the liberty of the Press, for the purpose,
</p>
<p>as they pretended, of repressing the audacity of the
</p>
<p>Democrats, whom the new Aristocrats hypocritically
</p>
<p>affected to confound with the Royalists, as though both
</p>
<p>these parties had in view the same ends.
</p>
<p>The new legislation having excluded from the right of
</p>
<p>being enrolled in the registers of Juries for criminal
</p>
<p>cases, all who did not pay the electoral qualification,
</p>
<p>the consequence was that the poorer classes lost all \
</p>
<p>guarantees for impartial justice, and were left com
</p>
<p>pletely at the mercy of their natural enemies, the rich.
</p>
<p>Hence resulted judicial severity for them,  lenity and
</p>
<p>indulgence for fie privileged classes. So dangerous
</p>
<p>and glaring an abuse was, of course, denounced by the
</p>
<p>Society, to the people, and to the legislative body, but
</p>
<p>the latter cunningly remained mute.
</p>
<p>Those who, from the outset, had pro- Prudence of the
</p>
<p>posed to themselves to make the Society 0Clety-
</p>
<p>of the Pantheon a rallying point for the restorers of the
</p>
<p>democracy, kept two points constantly in view  to
</p>
<p>revive the popular energy, and at the same time to
</p>
<p>warily avoid offending the constitutional authorities, up
</p>
<p>to the moment when the general rectification of opinion
</p>
<p>would permit it to speak out without subterfuge, and
</p>
<p>would render vain the efforts of the oppressors in power.
</p>
<p>Consequently, they desired to limit themselves to abstract
</p>
<p>discussions on the rights of man and of states, without
</p>
<p>making any direct application to the tyrants of the day ;
</p>
<p>and it was in accordance with this prudence that the

<p>Society that their wishes were beginning to be accom

</p>
<p>field to their operations. Up to this period, they had
</p>
<p>confined themselves to the work of concentrating and

<p>conviction that, as their political doctrine was the in

</p>
<p>reasonable as practicable, to present it as the code of the

<p>Divinity  that is to say, as the object of natural religion.
</p>
<p>In fact, the practice of a worship which presented the

</p>
<p>conciliating the class that value Christianity only for the

<p>those that abhor superstition. It was, moreover, founded

<p>to replace the practices of the Catholic Church by other
</p>
<p>practices  what the Government itself sought at that
</p>
<p>time to accomplish by the introduction of decadary
</p>
<p>festivals  they determined upon celebrating these fes
</p>
<p>tivals publicly, and for this purpose to demand a spacious
</p>
<p>temple from the Executive Directory. The latter, pene
</p>
<p>trating the design, and apprehending the consequences
</p>
<p>of complying with this demand, refused it, under the
</p>
<p>pretext that it was about to occupy itself with the pro
</p>
<p>posed celebration. It became then necessary to hold a
</p>
<p>clearer language to the Society, and to give a glimpse at
</p>
<p>those secret views which it would have been indiscreet to
</p>
<p>reveal to it to their full extent. The intention was to
</p>
<p>place the Society under the protection of religious forms,
</p>
<p>in order to enjoy the publicity and places of worship
</p>
<p>guaranteed by the law to the members of all religious
</p>
<p>sects. The discussion which took place on this subject
</p>
<p>was very animated, and was prolonged during several
</p>
<p>sittings. The authors of the project were obliged to
</p>
<p>combat the opposition of orators who laboured to prevent
</p>
<p>its execution, sometimes by recommending a dutiful
</p>
<p>deportment towards the Government, and sometimes by
</p>
<p>exhibiting every religious form as the source of a new
</p>
<p>superstition. At length all obstacles were surmounted,
</p>
<p>and the Society resolved "to devote the decadis* (every
</p>
<p>" tenth day) to the public worship of the Divinity, by
</p>
<p>" preaching the laws of natural religion." A commis

<p>By several traits of this nature, the upstart aristocracy was
</p>
<p>enabled to recognize in this Geneial (already celebrated by the re
</p>
<p>capture of Toulon from the enemy, and by the proceedings of the
</p>
<p>13th Vendemiaire) the man that might one day lend it a solid sup
</p>
<p>port against the people ; and it was the knowledge thus had of his
</p>
<p>haughty character, and aristocratic opinions, which caused him to
</p>
<p>be called from Egypt, before the 18th Brumaire of the Year VIII.,
</p>
<p>to the aid of this party, already terrified at the rapidity with which
</p>
<p>the democratic spirit was reviving throughout France. Bonaparte
</p>
<p>was hoisted to supreme power in consequence of the retrograde
</p>
<p>babeuf's conspiracy. 85
</p>
<p>Thus, as in all aristocratic governments, Perfidy of the
</p>
<p>there was in that of the French Republic Government-
</p>
<p>a spirit equally opposed to the authority of an individual,
</p>
<p>as to the power of the people. The ardour, however,
</p>
<p>with which the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people
</p>
<p>had been recently received by the generality of the
</p>
<p>nation, and preached by even some of the founders of
</p>
<p>march impressed on the Revolution by the events of the 9th
</p>
<p>Thermidor  that disastrous epoch, after which the authority,
</p>
<p>which governed the skeleton of the Republic, having separated
</p>
<p>itself from the working classes, had to maintain an incessant
</p>
<p>struggle against the Royalists on the one hand, and the wreck of
</p>
<p>the democratic party on the other. It was seen, in fact, to combat
</p>
<p>this latter party in Prairial of the Year III., to overthrow the
</p>
<p>friends of royalty in Aendemiaire of the Year IV., to proscribe
</p>
<p>the Democrats in Floreal and Fructidor of the same year, to pursue
</p>
<p>the Royalists in Fructidor of the Year V., and to quash and nullify
</p>
<p>the popular elections in Prairial of the Year VI. In the last
</p>
<p>months of the Year VII., the popular tempest blowing louder and
</p>
<p>fiercer than ever, and the armies of the enemy becoming more
</p>
<p>menacing, the usurpers of the national sovereignty felt themselves
</p>
<p>pressed between the vengeance of the old regime and the justice
</p>
<p>of the people, but too much the enemies of equality to have recourse
</p>
<p>to a capitulation, which they might have easily obtained from the
</p>
<p>popular party ; they preferred exposing themselves to all the
</p>
<p>chances of military despotism, by delivering on the 18th Brumaire
</p>
<p>of the Year VIII., the French Republic to the unlimited power of
</p>
<p>an imperious soldier, whose ambition and audacity they in vain
</p>
<p>ttattered themselves with being able to check.
</p>
<p>Thus was it, in consequence of the policy that prevailed on the
</p>
<p>9th Thermidor of the Year II., that those who presided over the
</p>
<p>destinies of France were led to view the war of invasion as a pow
</p>
<p>erful means of absorbing the attention of the nation  of diverting
</p>
<p>it from the care of its rights  of exhausting progressively the de

</p>
<p>to explain, on any other hypothesis, the conduct observed in Italy
</p>
<p>and Switzerland, and, especially, that impolitic and criminal ex

</p>
<p>The consulate and the empire were, then, as much the conse

<p>quences of the war of invasion whence Bonaparte emerged, as of

<p>the politics of the interior ; these two causes have their common

<p>source in the plots of which Robespierre was the victim. Bona

<p>parte might, by the firmness of his character and by the ascendancy
</p>
<p>of his military exploits, have been the restorer of French liberty ; *
</p>
<p>but, the creature of vulgar ambition, he preferred being its last

<p>worst destroyer  he held in his hands the happiness of Europe,
</p>
<p>and he proved its scourge by the systematic oppression he made
</p>
<p>her groan under, and by that still more terrible oppression of which
</p>
<p>he prepared the elements, and under which were buried, after his
</p>
<p>fall, in the name of liberty itself (by the Holy Alliance), so many
</p>
<p>nations of this part of the globe. The more we reflect on the

<p>the new Aristocracy, did not permit the latter party to
</p>
<p>make a crime of it, in the Democrats, by painting them
</p>
<p>under their true colours. Accordingly, in order to make
</p>
<p>them the victims of public hatred, they were obliged to
</p>
<p>treat them as disguised Royalists, who aspired to bring
</p>
<p>back the nation to kingly government, by the circuitous
</p>
<p>route of anarchy, with which they affected to confound
</p>
<p>democratic principles. This political fraud may be dis
</p>
<p>covered in all the acts of the new usurpation against the
</p>
<p>popular party;* the Directorial decree which closed,
</p>
<p>together with the Pantheon, several Royalist unions, that
</p>
<p>were opened immediately afterwards, is a proof of this ;
</p>
<p>to which may be added other more decisive ones, of

<p>which I shall have occasion to speak, when I render an

<p>Similar imputations were lavished in abundance against-

<p>the Pantheonists by the Directory, whom it accused of

<p>having audaciously demanded the Constitution of 1793

<p>and the Dictatorship. As to the latter, the question
</p>
<p>was never even mooted ; and though the Constitution of

<p>Mailhe on the popular societies against the already too
</p>
<p>restricted right of assembling, guaranteed by the Con

</p>
<p>assumed a more than ordinarily menacing and odious
</p>
<p>character, had the effect of producing against it, a com
</p>
<p>bination of patriots of all shades, and of making them
</p>
<p>unanimously desire its speedy overthrow. The Pan-
</p>
<p>theonists, dispersed by violence, re-assembled at first in

<p>the public places when the fine weather returned. Cer

<p>against the Directorial Act ; others, after the example of

<p>more peremptorily than ever to the recovery of its rights.
</p>
<p>Amongst the writings which then circulated in Paris,

<p>there was one remarkable paper, entitled :  " Soldier,

<p>tried to excite against him the indignation of the popular

<p>instigators of the crimes of the 9th Thermidor, and by

<p>maliciously reminding them of his writings against certain

<p>devotion, and by that means favoured the development

<p>of his plans.

<p>certain that Babeuf, who aimed at directing all the de

<p>or indiscretion  these were the first cares of the Direc

<p>of the twelve arrondissements of Paris, and intermediary
</p>
<p>agents to maintain correspondence and communications

<p>this act was added an instruction, in which, after having

<p>explained to these agents the motives and justice of the

<p>enterprise, the Directory traced out to them the route to

<p>be followed in order to guarantee its success. X There
</p>
<p>was in fact, however, no other intermediary agent than

<p>were constantly above all praise. Though, according to

<p>the purity of his patriotism, his wisdom, and his fidelity,

<p>concurrence of the people, not to place in the latter its
</p>
<p>chief reliance. Without the support of the people, it felt
</p>
<p>that all its labours would be fruitless ; therefore, to secure
</p>
<p>that, was now its main desideratum.
</p>
<p>Before the French Revolution had exhibited to the
</p>
<p>world the extraordinary spectacle of several millions of
</p>
<p>men proclaiming, and sealing with their blood, those
</p>
<p>eternal truths, which, in antecedent times, had been
</p>
<p>known but to a few philosophers, the design of putting
</p>
<p>the people in movement, by the sole force of these
</p>
<p>truths, might have appeared chimerical; but this was
</p>
<p>not the case at the epoch when the Secret Directory
</p>
<p>was formed. The question, then, was not how to create
</p>
<p>a new opinion, but how to concentrate and organize that
</p>
<p>which had already existed so short a time before,* and
</p>
<p>which calumny and proscription had divided and stifled.
</p>
<p>There was a period during the Revolution, when the
</p>
<p>well-founded hope of an approaching equality, exercising
</p>
<p>a powerful influence on the hearts of the people, at
</p>
<p>tached them cordially to the new order of things. But
</p>
<p>disappointed in the attempt, they regretted, after the 9th
</p>
<p>Thermidor, the sacrifices they had made, and regarding
</p>
<p>as an ignis fatuus the happiness once promised them,
</p>
<p>began to feel even an aversion towards the Revolution
</p>
<p>and its champions. This disposition of popular opinion
</p>
<p>furnished the Royalists with occasion to discredit the
</p>
<p>Republican system, and the Aristocrats with plaus'ble
</p>
<p>grounds for inculcating a horror of insurrections, and an
</p>
<p>indifference to politics. Again, proscription had greatly
</p>
<p>thinned the ranks of the decided Republicans ; the sur
</p>
<p>vivors, dispersed by violence or divided by calumny, no
</p>
<p>longer inspired that confidence by the aid of which they
</p>
<p>had formerly conducted the people to the conquest of
</p>
<p>its rights.

<p>itself drawn. It will be seen, at the close of this work,
</p>
<p>by what supplements they proposed to prevent these
</p>
<p>dangers. Notwithstanding these blemishes, the Secret
</p>
<p>Directory determined to maintain the respect vowed, to
</p>
<p>this Constitution by the Republicans, and this, for two
</p>
<p>supreme reasons : 1. The almost unanimous sanction
</p>
<p>it had received from the nation; and 2. The right of
</p>
<p>the people, consecrated by itself, to deliberate on the
</p>
<p>babeuf's conspiracy. 93
</p>
<p>laws. It was in this latter provision, especially, that it
</p>
<p>saw the distinguishing excellence of the Constitution of
</p>
<p>1793, of which all the other parts appeared to it but as
</p>
<p>articles of regulation. They agreed, then, to take this
</p>
<p>constitution for a rallying point, and to represent its esta
</p>
<p>blishment as the means of attaining that.charming equality,
</p>
<p>of which they, meanwhile, continued to demonstate the
</p>
<p>justice, to demand the practice, and to develope the
</p>
<p>fundamental laws. It was not by the aid ^ rutn the ereat
</p>
<p>of a handful of factious persons, excited by moving prin-
</p>
<p>a thirst of gain, or by a mad fanaticism, ciple of the
</p>
<p>that the Secret Directory pretended to rectum lnsur"
</p>
<p>overthrow the ruling usurpation ; it de
</p>
<p>sired to employ no other moving principle than the force
</p>
<p>of truth. The frank and full exposition of the people's
</p>
<p>rights, and the crimes of its oppressors, was the sole
</p>
<p>means by which it counted on raising the population of
</p>
<p>Paris against tyranny, at the moment when public indig
</p>
<p>nation would be fiercest and most general; then, but
</p>
<p>not till then, would it have hoisted its standard, and
</p>
<p>given the signal for insurrection.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, its first care was to labour Associations of
</p>
<p>to convince the multitude, and to make tipped in Paris.
</p>
<p>proselytes. To this end, it spared neither
</p>
<p>discourses nor writings; and to circulate them with
</p>
<p>more effect, it instituted in Paris a great number of small
</p>
<p>associations, mutually unknown to each other, but all
</p>
<p>under the direction of the Democrats, who themselves
</p>
<p>received their cue and instructions from the twelve revo
</p>
<p>lutionary agents. It is worth observing, in the instructions
</p>
<p>given to these agents, the precautions by which the Direc
</p>
<p>tory of Public Safety endeavoured to guard the Demo
</p>
<p>crats from the consequences of imprudence and perfidy.
</p>
<p>From the outset, the Revolutionary agents were de

</p>
<p>From the moment that the supreme authority had
</p>
<p>quitted the paths of justice, its decrees ceased to have
</p>
<p>for their support, public opinion and the people's love.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, they experienced now as much of coldness
</p>
<p>and resistance as they formerly had of ease and rapidity
</p>
<p>in their execution. Since the death of Robespierre it
</p>
<p>became necessary to substitute the resource of force for
</p>
<p>that of popular affection ; it was necessary to intimidate
</p>
<p>the multitude, whose just resentment was feared by the
</p>
<p>parties that had usurped its sovereignty. After having
</p>
<p>surrounded themselves with a crowd of enemies of the
</p>
<p>Revolution, whose baseness and bad faith were not slow
</p>
<p>in developing themselves, the moderators of the aristo
</p>
<p>cratic system perceived that their safety could only re
</p>
<p>pose on a prop of bayonets, placed in blind subjection to
</p>
<p>their creatures, till at last, under pretence of maintaining
</p>
<p>the public tranquillity, they actually transformed the
</p>
<p>sanctuary of the national representation, of which the
</p>
<p>attachment of the citizens had recently constituted the
</p>
<p>sole defence, into a military camp, which menaced their
</p>
<p>liberties and their lives.
</p>
<p>This army around and within Paris, which in Germinal
</p>
<p>and Prairial of the Year III., had aided the enemies of
</p>
<p>liberty to establish their empire, was maintained and
</p>
<p>augmented by the Constitutional Government ; one might
</p>
<p>perceive at its head, ex-nobles, who were prisoners in the
</p>
<p>Year II., and generally speaking, men who had given
</p>
<p>conspicuous proofs of their hatred of the sovereignty of
</p>
<p>the people. The presence of these numerous forces de
</p>
<p>voted to tyranny, compared with the state of disarmament
</p>
<p>to which the Government had (under the twofold pretext
</p>
<p>of disarming the Royalists and the Terrorists) reduced
</p>
<p>the people, might possibly discourage the multitude, and
</p>
<p>dispose it to dread the least opposition.
</p>

<p>the success of its enterprize, the Secret Directory ranged
</p>
<p>the resistance of the troops, and even the bare contem
</p>
<p>plation of such resistance by the people, which might
</p>
<p>prove equally fatal as the reality itself. Accordingly
</p>
<p>did it apply itself in time to render such obstacle void,
</p>
<p>by rekindling in the breasts of the soldiers the love of
</p>
<p>democracy  by reminding them of the mighty interests
</p>
<p>96 babeuf's CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>for which they had shed their blood, and by insensiblv
</p>
<p>weaning them from that servile obedience to their chiefs,
</p>
<p>which the tyrants had artfully represented to them as an
</p>
<p>imperious duty. It *vas, moreover, by the ascendancy
</p>
<p>of truth that the conspirators desired to inflame the army
</p>
<p>with hatred of the aristocratic Government, to the end
</p>
<p>of inducing it to join its forces to those of the people by
</p>
<p>a unanimous burst of patriotism.
</p>
<p>To this intent the Secret Directory Military agents.
</p>
<p>added successively to the agents of arondissments, mili
</p>
<p>tary agents, charged with similar functions as the former,
</p>
<p>to be exercised amongst the battalions stationed at Paris
</p>
<p>and in the environs. It accorded its confidence
</p>
<p>To Fion for the Invalides ;
</p>
<p>To Germain for the Legion of Police;
</p>
<p>To Sasemy for the detachments cantoned at Fran-
</p>
<p>ciade ;
</p>
<p>To Vannec for the troops in general ; and
</p>
<p>To Georges Grisel for the camp of Grenelle.
</p>
<p>The horrid part played by this Grisel in the denoue
</p>
<p>ment of the conspiracy, requires that we make known,
</p>
<p>to the full extent, the circumstances and motives which
</p>
<p>gave him access to the principal defenders of equality.
</p>
<p>Besides the civil and military agents already described,
</p>
<p>the Secret Directory had instituted superintendants, who
</p>
<p>examined their conduct, directed their proceedings, and
</p>
<p>communicated fresh vigour to their operations. Darthe
</p>
<p>and Germain were charged with this important office.
</p>
<p>Both had hitherto rendered most signal services to the
</p>
<p>cause of equality ; it was through them that the Direc
</p>
<p>tory became more particularly acquainted with what
</p>
<p>transpired at the popular assemblies, and to them only
</p>
<p>used it to entrust all difficult commissions, in which
</p>
<p>they invariably acquitted themselves with a precision
</p>
<p>and courage, which only profound conviction of right,

<p>and a complete devotion to the cause, could inspire.
</p>
<p>Darthe, indefatigable and intrepid, expert in impart
</p>
<p>ing the fire of his own soul to those of his auditors 
</p>
<p>skilful to repress the too precipitate bursts of opinion,
</p>
<p>and to conciliate its conflicting differences  exerted him
</p>
<p>self to encourage and bring together the friends of
</p>
<p>equality, and to discover the parties that could best
</p>
<p>BABEUF S CONSPIRACY. 97
</p>
<p>promote its cause. With these objects it was that he
</p>
<p>frequented the Caft des Bains Chinois (Chinese Baths),
</p>
<p>which was the daily resort of several Democrats, and that
</p>
<p>he connected himself with Georges Grisel, of Abbeville,
</p>
<p>at that time a captain attached to the third battalion of
</p>
<p>the thirty-eighth demi-brigade of the line, encamped on
</p>
<p>the plain of Grenelle, near Paris.
</p>
<p>Grisel, who, like so many others, appears to Grisel.
</p>
<p>have seen in the Revolution only a great occasion for per
</p>
<p>sonal aggrandizement, sought after and courted the
</p>
<p>patriots. By imitating their language, he succeeded in
</p>
<p>passing amongst them for an ardent revolutionist ; and
</p>
<p>that step gained, he had not much difficulty in cap
</p>
<p>tivating the good will of some Democrats, who introduced
</p>
<p>him to Darthe, as a person that would prove valuable
</p>
<p>to their party. The imprudent eulogies lavished on
</p>
<p>Grisel by his introducers, his own conversations, the
</p>
<p>ardour with which he volunteered to spread the writings
</p>
<p>of the Secret Directory amongst the troops, and editing
</p>
<p>himself an insurrectionary pamphlet tending to provoke
</p>
<p>insubordination in the army, persuaded the too confident
</p>
<p>Darthe of the purity of his intentions, and determined
</p>
<p>him to propose him to the Secret Directory, which
</p>
<p>needed to have a military agent at the camp of Grenelle.
</p>
<p>He was nominated to that office, and the instructions
</p>
<p>relative to his mission were delivered to him by Darthe
</p>
<p>on the '26th Germinal.
</p>
<p>As soon as the agencies it had instituted Democratic
</p>
<p>were sufficiently organized, the Secret wntmss-
</p>
<p>Directory set immediately to work to circulate such
</p>
<p>writings as it thought v/ould undeceive the people. It was
</p>
<p>expedient to show the latter that its sovereignty had
</p>
<p>been usurped by the existing authority  that the Con
</p>
<p>stitution of 179-3 was the only legitimate one  that the

<p>equality of all  and that the evils attributed to the
</p>
<p>Revolution had happened only in consequence of that
</p>
<p>Revolution having been prevented from attaining its '
</p>
<p>legitimate end. Every democratic pen was put in con
</p>
<p>tribution. Babeuf, in his Tribune of the People, de- <
</p>
<p>veloped the spirit of the insurrectional institution, and
</p>
<p>Simon Duplay propagated the same doctrines amongst
</p>
<p>98 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>the poor and working classes, by means of a small sheet,
</p>
<p>entitled the Enlightener (L'Eclaireur). The Repub
</p>
<p>licans directing the Journal des Hommes libres
</p>
<p>(Journal of free men), also rendered important services
</p>
<p>to the democracy, by the discussions which they had the
</p>
<p>boldness to moot on forms of government, and respecting
</p>
<p>the grand system of equality, the justice of which they
</p>
<p>caused to shine forth, by inserting the victorious replies
</p>
<p>of its advocates, in answer to their own objections inten
</p>
<p>tionally put forth for the purpose.
</p>
<p>One of the first cares of the Secret Directory was, to
</p>
<p>mark out, in a positive manner, the rallying points in
</p>
<p>Paris where the people in insurrection should assemble.
</p>
<p>This it effected by means of the " Analysis of Babeuf's
</p>
<p>Doctrine," which was distributed and placarded on the
</p>
<p>20th Germinal with immense profusion ; and, though the
</p>
<p>Government endeavoured by its agents to tear down the
</p>
<p>placards, and intercept the writing from the public eye,
</p>
<p>such was the impression it made on all minds, that the
</p>
<p>Aristocrats were driven to the desperate subterfuge of
</p>
<p>transcribing it into their journals as a master-piece of
</p>
<p>extravagance and audacity, while the patriots universally
</p>
<p>made it the subject of their conversations and hopes.
</p>
<p>On the 23d Germinal appeared " Thoughts on our
</p>
<p>two Constitutions ;" on the 24th was published the
</p>
<p>letter of " Freeman to his friend Terror;" on the 25th
</p>
<p>was circulated the paper entitled, " Do we owe obedience
</p>
<p>to the Constitution of 1795 (or Year III) ?" on the
</p>
<p>27th was distributed the " Tribunes Address to the
</p>
<p>Army ;" on the 29th was spread the " Letter in reply
</p>
<p>to M. V. ;" and on the 1st Floreal was put into the
</p>
<p>people's hands the " Cry of the French People against
</p>

</p>
<p>and thereby causing a scarcity of provisions, reduced the
</p>
<p>labourers either to go without the necessaries of life or
</p>
<p>else part with their furniture, and even their most in
</p>
<p>dispensable garments, in order to procure specie, with
</p>
<p>which alone commodities could be purchased.*
</p>
<p>This frightful distress, joined to the writings of the
</p>
<p>Secret Directory, which at once demonstrated its cause
</p>
<p>and the radical remedy for it, produced so intense and
</p>
<p>general a fermentation, that very soon the discontent
</p>
<p>propagated by the secret associations burst forth publicly,
</p>
<p>and caused the numerous gatherings that were seen
</p>
<p>towards the middle of Germinal of the Year IV. in the
</p>
<p>streets, in the open places, and on the bridges of Paris.
</p>
<p>Then did the usurpers of the popular sovereignty learn
</p>
<p>with certainty that their enemies were re-uniting in mass,
</p>
<p>and that the people, while invoking equality and the
</p>
<p>democratic constitution, uttered regrets for the victims
</p>
<p>immolated to corruption and aristocracy, on the 9th

<p>sures, which, before the 9th Thermidor, had precluded the neces

<p>were despoiled of the necessaries of existence, which went to

<p>[It may be observed here, that one of Robespierre's reasons for
</p>
<p>guarding against an over issue of assignats was, that the thousand

<p>millions' worth of national property, decreed and promised by the

<p>National Convention to the defenders of the country, might not
</p>
<p>be reduced to a nullity by the depreciation of the national money,

<p>circumstances rendered a thorny one. It was to deter

<p>that whose destruction was contemplated ?

</p>
<p>conformable to the Constitution of 1793. In the first
</p>
<p>place, it was evident that an interval of some time should
</p>
<p>elapse between the insurrection and the installation of the
</p>
<p>new constitutional authority ; and it was not less sensibly
</p>
<p>felt that it would be the maddest imprudence to leave
</p>
<p>the nation for an instant without a director or guide.
</p>
<p>Other considerations induced the Secret Directory to
</p>
<p>think that this interval of time should be longer than
</p>
<p>what would be strictly required by the elections and
</p>
<p>the arrival of the new Deputies. These considerations i
</p>
<p>deserve to be developed.

<p>desired also  what was by far the most st'tutloniU
</p>
<p>important branch of their mission  to
</p>
<p>procure useful and durable laws for France. And though
</p>
<p>the Secret Directory was not ignorant that the mode in
</p>
<p>which the law is emitted and executed may exercise
</p>
<p>some influence on the institutions to be established, his
</p>
<p>tory, and the experience of the French Revolution, had
</p>
<p>forewarned it that the certain effect of inequality of con
</p>
<p>dition is to divide the citizens, to create opposing interests,
</p>
<p>to foment hostile passions, and to subject the multitude
</p>
<p>(whom it renders ignorant, credulous, and the victims of
</p>
<p>excessive labour) to a small number of informed and
</p>
<p>crafty men, who, abusing the preference acquired by
</p>
<p>their address, apply themselves afterwards only to pre
</p>
<p>serve and strengthen, in the distribution of goods and
</p>
<p>advantages, the social order that exclusively favours
</p>
<p>themselves. > Hence the Directory concluded, that a j

</p>
<p>for it to exercise effectually, and not in mere fiction, the j
</p>
<p>plenitude of its sovereignty.
</p>
<p>From this train of reflection arose the project for re
</p>
<p>placing the existing Government by a revolutionary and
</p>
<p>provisional authority, constituted in such a manner as to
</p>
<p>withdraw the people for ever from the influence of the
</p>
<p>natural enemies of equality, and to restore to it the unity
</p>
<p>102 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>of will necessary for the adoption of Republican institu-
</p>
<p>! tions. What shall this authority be ? Behold a delicate
</p>
<p>question that was very scrupulously examined by the
</p>
<p>Secret Directory. The three propositions formerly agi
</p>
<p>tated at Amar's house were reproduced for discussion ;
</p>
<p>the first was foi recalling the Mountain, or supposed-
</p>
<p>v Radical part of the Convention ; the second, for creating
</p>
<p>* a Dictatorship ; the third, for establishing a new body,
</p>
<p>v charged and empowered to consummate the Revolution
</p>
<p>for the happiness of the people.'
</p>
<p>Recal of the Amar had proposed in the first Com-
</p>
<p>Convention. mittee to recal the National Convention ;
</p>
<p>that body, said he, which could not be replaced, but by
</p>
<p>an authority willed by the people, having been deposed,
</p>
<p>m virtue of a constitution and laws contrary to its
</p>
<p>sovereign will, is still the only legitimate authority.
</p>
<p>Again, continued Amar, the legitimacy of its (the Con
</p>
<p>vention's) decrees depended upon the freedom of the
</p>
<p>Deputies, guaranteed by the established forms for pro
</p>
<p>secuting those of its members against whom any grave
</p>
<p>accusations might be urged ; but certain members of the
</p>
<p>Convention (Mountainists) were arrested, banished, or
</p>
<p>despoiled of their political rights, without process of
</p>
<p>? trial or judgment, in Germinal and Prairial of the Year
</p>

</p>
<p>to these violences, are null and void ; the establishment

<p>provisional authority, to which it would be unavoidably

<p>necessary to confide the government of the nation. In

<p>fact, considering the physical impossibility of collecting
</p>
<p>at once the suffrages of all the French, it was the only
</p>
<p>means of rendering to the sovereignty of the people all

<p>advantage was joined that of a greater probability of a

</p>
<p>The next question Mas, to decide what provisional
</p>
<p>form should be proposed to the people of Paris in insur
</p>
<p>rection. Upon this pcint there was great diversity of
</p>
<p>opinion. Some of the members of the Directory Mere
</p>
<p>for the dictatorship of an individual ; the rest preferred
</p>
<p>a new body, composed of a small number of tried De- '
</p>
<p>mocrats. This latter opinion prevailed.
</p>
<p>Bedon and Darthe, who proposed the
</p>
<p>dictatorship, attached to this word the PJf orsh'P re"
</p>
<p>idea of an extraordinary authority, con
</p>
<p>fided to an individual, to be charged with the double
</p>
<p>function of proposing to the people a plan of legisla
</p>
<p>tion simple, and suited to ensure to it equality, and
</p>
<p>the real exercise of its sovereignty ; and to dictate
</p>
<p>provisionally the preparatory measures necessary to
</p>
<p>dispose the nation to receive it. According to them,
</p>
<p>it being impossible to achieve so bold and important a
</p>
<p>task unless by the aid of a perfect unity of thought and
</p>
<p>action, it should be conceived and executed by a single
</p>
<p>head. In support of their opinion, they appealed to the
</p>
<p>example of ancient states, and called to mind the dis
</p>
<p>astrous consequences of plurality, of which they had so
</p>
<p>many recent proofs in the divisions of the Committee of
</p>
<p>Public Safety. As to the dangers of abuse to be appre
</p>
<p>hended from such a magistracy, it appeared to them that
</p>
<p>they might be easily avoided by well ascertaining the virtue
</p>
<p>of the citizen to be clothed with such power  by the clear
</p>
<p>and legal exposition of the end to be attained by it 
</p>
<p>and by imposing limits beforehand to its duration.
</p>
<p>By this system the task of the Secret Directory was
</p>
<p>reduced to these points : to trace out in a few articles

<p>the object of the reform sought; to fix a limited time to

<p>Directory, however, judged differently of it. Not that
</p>
<p>it distrusted the soundness of the motives alleged in
</p>
<p>favour of the dictatorship, but the difficulty of making
</p>
<p>a good choice  the fear of abuse  the apparent resem

<p>blance of this magistracy to royalty  and, above all, the
</p>
<p>general prejudice against it, which was thought insur
</p>
<p>mountable, induced it to prefer a body of individuals,
</p>
<p>but not numerous, to whom might be entrusted the
</p>
<p>same powers, without running the same hazards, and
</p>
<p>without having so many obstacles to overcome.
</p>
<p>The result of this grave deliberation
</p>
<p>ing V^n" De"- was, that after the destruction of tyranny,
</p>
<p>mocrat from the people of Paris should be engaged to
</p>
<p>each Depart- create a National Assembly, clothed with
</p>
<p>ment to be pro- . t c r>

<p>posed to the supreme power, and composed of a De-
</p>
<p>people of Paris mocrat from each department ;* and that,

</p>
<p>scrupulously search after, and scrutinize the Democrats
</p>
<p>to be proposed ; and, the Revolution achieved, that it
</p>
<p>should continue its labours, and keep watch over the
</p>
<p>conduct of the new assembly.
</p>
<p>Whilst the conspirators were thus regulating the
</p>
<p>major points, they did not neglect the minor ones. They
</p>
<p>closely observed every disposition of the people, however
</p>
<p>trifling in importance. They lost sight of no means for
</p>
<p>ensuring victory on the day of insurrection, which might
</p>
<p>possibly prove a day of combat also. In truth, they had
</p>
<p>every reason to expect that the army would abandon
</p>
<p>itself to the popular impulse ; but it would, nevertheless,
</p>
<p>be imprudent in the extreme not to take into account
</p>
<p>the influence which its aristocratic officers might be able
</p>
<p>to exercise over soldiers little informed, and habituated

<p>perseverance in the National Convention 1 In my opinion, it is
</p>
<p>not in order to preserve, but to establish, equality amongst the
</p>
<p>people of a corrupt state, that a strong and irresistible authority is
</p>
<p>needed. It may be reasonably presumed, that if in the Year II.,
</p>
<p>or the Year III., the French had the wisdom to invest a man of
</p>
<p>Robespierre's stamp with a Dictatorship such as Bedon and Darfhi

<p>Royalists, whose audacity they boasted that themselves
</p>
<p>alone could repress. In a word, they set every agency
</p>
<p>at work to constitute themselves the centre of the popular
</p>
<p>movement, of which they did not dissemble the approach.

<p>of driving from the legislative body, and from the

<p>Government, the men that offended them, such as
</p>
<p>Bossy d'Anglas, Isnard, Cadroy, Rovere, Lariviere,

<p>Hypocritical apostates spread themselves over the public

<p>of the Royalist conspirators, to seduce the people's at

<p>and to reinstate the latter in its lost confidence.
</p>
<p>Thus the less sagacious Republicans were exposed to

</p>
<p>From this double impulse arose very dangerous

<p>brigandism.* * It is with the same sort of good faith that parties pretended to
</p>
<p>attribute to Royalism, and to the foreign enemy, the conception of
</p>
<p>all the great measures by which Royalism was crushed and the
</p>
<p>foreign enemy vanquished, and that they pretended to treat as dis
</p>
<p>guised Royalists the men whose austerity and disinterestedness
</p>
<p>attested their sublime devotion to the cause of equality and liberty.
</p>
<p>This manoeuvre, of which the Girondists set the first example, for
</p>
<p>the purpose of justifying their conduct at the King's trial, and
</p>
<p>112 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>By the like imputations it was that the Post-Thermi-
</p>
<p>dorian Convention had succeeded in imposing upon
</p>
<p>France the yoke of the new aristocracy. Nevertheless,
</p>
<p>was there common sense in accusing of venality men who
</p>
<p>had emerged in a state of poverty from a Revolution,
</p>
<p>and from appointments which offered them so many op
</p>
<p>portunities of enriching themselves?" Did it belong to
</p>
<p>those who, after the 9th Thermidor, had practised so
</p>
<p>much violence, to stigmatise as anarchists men, the utmost
</p>
<p>stretch of whose demands went no farther than the exe
</p>
<p>cution of the law which the French people had sanctioned ?
</p>
<p>The real, the only anarchy, said the Democrats, is in
</p>
<p>the pretended laws which, violating the natural rights of
</p>
<p>men, condemn nations either to interminable convulsions
</p>
<p>or to the lethargy of death. Their uniform conduct, and
</p>
<p>the vows they incessantly offered up for the establishment
</p>
<p>of a true Republic, were a sufficient answer to the libellous
</p>
<p>reproach of disguised royalism which nobody credited.
</p>
<p>The Royalists applauded this cheat, which relieved them
</p>
<p>from their most formidable enemies, and made them even
</p>
<p>conceive the vain hope of attaching them (the Democrats)
</p>
<p>to themselves, as auxiliaries against the Directorial
</p>
<p>Government. Solid as were these reasons, they did not confound the
</p>
<p>effrontery of the Executive Directory ; indebted for its
</p>
<p>their hatred of the true founders of the Republic, has been since
</p>
<p>brought to perfection by those eunuchs in politics, who, incapable
</p>
<p>of those generous movements which save and regenerate nations,
</p>
<p>revenge themselves, for the nullity to which they are condemned.
</p>
<p>by detracting from the great men whose virtues appear chimerical
</p>
<p>to them, through the means of base intrigues, which constitute
</p>
<p>their whole stock of political science. To hear these wretches,
</p>
<p>you would suppose that the revolutionary action was conceived
</p>
<p>and directed by the principal persons who were attainted by it 
</p>
<p>that the brothers of Louis XVI. had solicited his condemnation

<p>that the Royalists who lost their lives on the 2d and 3rd of Sep

<p>rally around itself all classes of citizens, by the frightful

<p>which turned many a villain pale. It attested the exist

<p>ence of a courageous association determined upon over

<p>throwing the new constitutional tyranny.
</p>
<p>Such was, then, the corruption and L

<p>a criminal invasion of the liberties of the public. Under

<p>might be dispersed by force as a seditious mob. By these v

<p>that it was not yet time to give battle. Fearing one of

<p>much to establish the Aristocrats' empire, and regarding
</p>
<p>its enterprise as a last effort, whose bad success would

</p>
<p>which appeared to it indispensable for victory.
</p>
<p>Although the names of the Secret Directors had a

</p>
<p>damped its friends, appeared to it no less dangerous
</p>
<p>than an imprudent precipitation. Decided upon promptly
</p>
<p>saving liberty or perishing with it, it quickened the ope
</p>
<p>rations of the revolutionary agents, redoubled its zeal to
</p>
<p>draw over the army, of which it was not yet sure, and
</p>
<p>assiduously exerted itself in regulating the forms of the
</p>
<p>insurrection, and the legislation which was to follow it.
</p>
<p>The first object that naturally presented gome of the in- 
</p>
<p>itself for discussion was the manner of surrectional
</p>
<p>effecting the dissolution of the existing measures.
</p>
<p>illegitimate Authorities, and of disabling the members of
</p>
<p>them from enterprising any measures against equality.
</p>
<p>The unanimous design of the Secret Directory was to
</p>
<p>attain this double end by a great example of justice,
</p>
<p>capable of terrifying the traitors, and of inspiring with
</p>
<p>the same salutary dread all future deputies whom the
</p>
<p>people might honour with its confidence. Revolting
</p>
<p>treason, and a manifest usurpation, were the crimes of
</p>
<p>which the members of the two Councils, and those of
</p>
<p>the Executive Directory, had palpably rendered them
</p>
<p>selves guilty. Covered with the blood of the best citizens,
</p>
<p>they had robbed the people of its sovereignty, and had
</p>
<p>sacrificed the majority of the nation to the criminal pre
</p>
<p>tensions of a handful of insatiable and ambitious rich
</p>
<p>men. A signal punishment was necessary ; but indul
</p>
<p>gence and oblivion would have succeeded to a day of
</p>
<p>just and salutary terror, which would have left behind it
</p>
<p>only the remembrance of a legitimate and too tardy
</p>
<p>retribution. The majority of the Parisians, discontented, uneasy,
</p>
<p>unhappy, were looking back on the past, and regretted
</p>
<p>the times which had preceded the 9th Thermidor ; they
</p>
<p>had need, in order to overthrow the tyrants, to be led on
</p>
<p>by intrepid Repubhcans, who were themselves awaiting

<p>the signal of our conspirators. In this condition of

<p>withdraw the bulk of the working classes from the in

<p>people the demands that they should make, the route

<p>destruction of tyranny, this Act contained the forms of
</p>
<p>several legislative measures, designed to justify, in the
</p>
<p>eyes of the people, the benevolent intentions of the
</p>
<p>Secret Directory, and the legitimacy of its enterprize.
</p>
<p>Here they are : 
</p>
<p>1. A distribution, amongst the defenders of the country
</p>
<p>and the unhappy poor, of the properties of emigrants, o*f
</p>
<p>conspirators, and of the enemies of the people.
</p>
<p>2, The unhappy poor to be forthwith lodged in the
</p>
<p>houses of the conspirators.
</p>
<p>3. The gratuitous restitution of the effects of the
</p>
<p>people pledged at the Mont-de-Piite (Government
</p>
<p>Pawn-offices). 4. The adoption by the people of the wives, children,
</p>
<p>fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters, of the citizens that
</p>
<p>might fall m the insurrection, and abundant provision for

</p>
<p>which might possibly discourage its true friends, nor too
</p>
<p>much precipitation, which would only swell the num

</p>
<p>Directory fixed the attention and sustained the hopes of
</p>
<p>the labouring class, without indisposing those who, whilst
</p>
<p>they hated the upstart aristocracy, did not, for all that,
</p>
<p>lcve equality in tact. To distribute goods did not signify '
</p>
<p>to parcel out the landed property, for wealth consists
</p>
<p>not in lands but in the fruits they yield ; moreover, by
</p>
<p>distributing the fruits, its promise would have been com

<p>pletely fulfilled ; and that was what the Secret Directory

<p>and amongst the grenadiers charged with the guard of

<p>the legislative body.
</p>
<p>Nothing alarmed the Government so much as this
</p>
<p>spirit of opposition, of which the military had already let
</p>
<p>appear numerous symptoms. In that quarter was
</p>
<p>vanishing, as it thought, the only rampart which it
</p>
<p>BABEUF S CONSPIRACY, 119
</p>
<p>flattered itself with being able to oppose to the rage of
</p>
<p>the people. Thus, after having exhausted every seduction
</p>
<p>amongst the Legion of Police, it was forced to order
</p>
<p>away from Paris the two most insubordinate battalions of
</p>
<p>that body, which, by the law that instituted it, ought
</p>
<p>never to be engaged in service out of the city. This
</p>
<p>order, signified on the 9th Floreal, was followed by a
</p>
<p>formal disobedience, of which the immediate consequence
</p>
<p>was an increase of agitation amongst the people; indeed,
</p>
<p>the moment was supposed to be at hand when the
</p>
<p>existing tyranny might be disposed of on the cheapest
</p>
<p>terms. The Secret Directory, which, without having directly
</p>
<p>provoked the resistance of the legionaries, had never
</p>
<p>theless contributed to elicit it by the maxims it was in
</p>
<p>cessantly promulgating, was also of opinion that the
</p>
<p>moment of success was near, and although it had not
</p>
<p>yet in its power all the information it demanded, it would
</p>
<p>have determined on giving the signal of insurrection, if
</p>
<p>it had had the certainty of finding in the Legion of
</p>
<p>Police a sufficient force to repel the first efforts of the
</p>
<p>Government, and to augment thereby the confidence of
</p>
<p>the people.
</p>
<p>Every engine was set at work to constitute this point
</p>
<p>of support into a centre of movement, and for a moment
</p>
<p>the hope was entertained of rendering the insurrection

</p>
<p>number of the legionaries submitted to it with joy, and
</p>
<p>there was but too much reason to believe, that a few
</p>
<p>of the dangers to be encountered on the frontiers had
</p>
<p>been with many of them the true motives of their re
</p>
<p>sistance, which the republican soldiers had too lightly
</p>
<p>attributed to a generous patriotism.

<p>refractory to the orders of Government. From this
</p>
<p>numerous desertion, was formed the body which the
</p>
<p>Secret Directory, counted upon placing in the van
</p>
<p>guard of the insurrectional army. This tumultuous
</p>
<p>event redoubled the impatience of the people, whose
</p>
<p>impetuosity, every hour increasing, warned the Secret
</p>
<p>Directory that the denouement of the conspiracy
</p>
<p>could not any longer be deferred without extreme
</p>
<p>danger. Partial movements, fruitless no doubt, were
</p>
<p>about to burst forth; and, moreover, the loss of cer
</p>
<p>tain legionaries, arrested for having incited their com
</p>
<p>rades to resistance, seemed inevitable. It was of neces
</p>
<p>sity to prevent false steps, and to break the axe of
</p>
<p>authority; these circumstances engaged the Secret
</p>
<p>Directory to hasten the movement of the insurrection.

<p>while they took the former for their guide, they made a

<p>constant duty of the latter. Wishing to hasten the

</p>
<p>suitable dispositions to their forces ; and it was to effect
</p>
<p>this that they judged it necessary to surround themselves
</p>
<p>with citizens, who united in themselves the love of de
</p>
<p>mocracy and experience in military operations. Fion,
</p>
<p>Germain, Rossignol, Massart, and Grisel, all of them^
</p>
<p>officers or generals, were invited to the presence of the
</p>
<p>Secret Directory in the afternoon of the 11th Floreal.
</p>
<p>Grisel was admitted to it on account of the influence it
</p>
<p>was thought he could exercise upon the camp at Grenelle.
</p>
<p>At this assembly were present, Babeuf, p olitico-mili-
</p>
<p>Buonarroti, Bedon, Darthe, Marechal, tary sitting of
</p>
<p>Eriddy, and the five above-named mili- the llthFloreul

</p>
<p>gan by informing these latter of the final object of its
</p>
<p>labours  the point it had arrived at  and the road which
</p>
<p>remained to be travelled over. Afterwards it acquainted
</p>
<p>them with the insurrectional act, of which they approved ;
</p>
<p>and ended by inviting them to deliberate with it on the
</p>
<p>means to be taken to ensure the triumph of the people.
</p>
<p>It was decided that the Secret Directory, while it
</p>
<p>reserved to itself the conception of every necessary mea
</p>
<p>sure, and the supreme direction of the movement, should
</p>
<p>confide to a military committee the care of preparing the
</p>
<p>attack and defence, after furnishing it with the necessary
</p>
<p>instructions and plans relating thereto. The five military
</p>
<p>gentlemen already mentioned were named members of
</p>
<p>this new committee, whose first sitting was fixed for
</p>
<p>the following day, at the house of Eris, in the street
</p>
<p>Montblanc. In the general assembly already spoken of, Germain
</p>
<p>had shown himself an ardent Democrat, Massart did not
</p>
<p>belie the character he had manifested at Amar's house,
</p>
<p>Grisel played the part of a Republican to perfection,
</p>
<p>Fion and Rossignol, while they applauded the views of
</p>
<p>the Secret Directory, only regretted that there were not
</p>
<p>in its body some of the ex-conventional Mountainists.

<p>The love of money was judged criminal

<p>rators anything bevond what was necessary for the print

</p>
<p>kind were indispensable, either to buy over certain agents
</p>
<p>of tyranny, or to furnish the Democrats with occasions
</p>
<p>to flatter and undeceive the deluded soldiery. Some
</p>
<p>steps were taken to obtain a little, but the largest amount

<p>accordingly reckoned on using his popularity as a lever

<p>of the insurrection. But Drouet was no stranger to the
</p>
<p>doings of the Mountainists, his old colleagues, and he
</p>
<p>appeared to incline in favour of blending the two con

<p>spiracies into one.
</p>
<p>At last Germain came to complete the Incertitude of

<p>perplexity of the Directory ; he manifested rectory016' Ul
</p>
<p>intense anxiety respecting the intentions
</p>
<p>of Fion and Rossignol, and seemed alarmed at the ob
</p>
<p>stacles about to be raised up by the ambition of the
</p>
<p>Mountainists, whose designs had just been confided to
</p>
<p>him by Ricord and by Allinoget, who had, at the same
</p>
<p>time, proposed to him a coalition with the Secret Direc

</p>
<p>a mutual understanding between them and the two

<p>before-mentioned members of the Military Commission.
</p>
<p>Bedon, who had always taken an active part in the

<p>labours of the Secret Directory, could not listen unmoved
</p>
<p>to the proposal of a coalition with the Mountainists,
</p>
<p>whom he reproached with the calamities which oppressed
</p>
<p>France. " Will you sully," he exclaimed, "your noble

<p>concur in any way for the re-establishment of the public
</p>
<p>welfare, appeared so evident to Bedon, that he inclined
</p>
<p>to believe a complete inaction would be preferable to
</p>
<p>the proposed coalition. This idea of renouncing the
</p>
<p>conspiracy was displeasing to the Secret Directory ; and
</p>
<p>so exasperated was one of its members at it, that he so
</p>
<p>far forgot himself as to accuse Bedon of pusillanimity.
</p>
<p>The altercation that ensued was, however, soon ap

<p>peased ; but the impression produced by it entered deep

<p>into the minds of the conspirators. They felt more
</p>
<p>strongly than ever how much prudence was required to
</p>
<p>prevent the best Democrats from being sacrificed without
</p>
<p>any advantage to the people, upon whom a failure would

<p>It was not dissembled that the result of a coalition

<p>favourable to the reforms sought ; but their daring bold

<p>ness, and, above all, the opinions of Fion and Rossignol

<p>seemed to be obstacles capable of clogging every wheel

<p>of the conspiracy. The faults of the Mountainists, and

<p>was a point confessed, that from the free determinations of

<p>these ex-Conventionalists, no such thing could be ex

<p>pected as the establishment  so much wished for  of an

<p>renouncing this equality, would have been only to avow
</p>
<p>themselves inconsequential and ambitious ; to burst the
</p>
<p>threads of the conspiracy at the moment when every
</p>
<p>thing betokened a speedy success, would have been to
</p>
<p>render themselves criminal in the eyes of the patriots,
</p>
<p>and of posterity ; it was necessary then to persevere in
</p>
<p>the first resolves, and elicit from circumstances the
</p>
<p>course most favourable to the popular cause.
</p>
<p>After a long and animated discussion, j res j
</p>
<p>the Secret Directory adopted the pro- coalesce with
</p>
<p>posed coalition, and resolved at the same tn? Moun-
</p>
<p>time to take great precautions to restrain taimsts-
</p>
<p>the ambition of the Mountainists, and to compel them
</p>
<p>to concur in the execution of its designs.
</p>
<p>After the explications that had been given, the con
</p>
<p>spirators, by adopting the coalition, would be pledged
</p>
<p>to re-establish the National Convention  that is to say,
</p>
<p>the section of that body which Amar regarded as the
</p>
<p>only one legitimate, and still existing by right ; if that.
</p>
<p>were done without any modification, France would be
</p>
<p>at the mercy of those against whom such Jieavy re
</p>
<p>proaches lay. To avoid so great a misfortune, the Secret
</p>
<p>Directory decided that the recal of the Convention
</p>
<p>should take place only on condition that the Moun
</p>
<p>tainists would consent to the following preliminaries :  '
</p>
<p>1. To superadd to the National Con- Conditions of

<p>vention, composed exclusively of the pro- the coalition.
</p>
<p>scribed Deputies, a Democrat from each department,
</p>
<p>to be named by the insurgent people upon the presenta

<p>on the spot, the provision of Article 18 of the Act of

<p>of the state of affairs of the motives which had caused
</p>
<p>the rejection of all thoughts of a coalition with his

<p>brethren of the Committee  and of those subsequent
</p>
<p>ones, in conformity with which that coalition was at

<p>length agreed to. The Act of Insurrection was read to

<p>the Mountainist Deputy, and a discussion forthwith
</p>
<p>raised as to the changes to be made in the article con
</p>
<p>cerning the Provisional Authority, which it was indis

<p>pensable to create. It was spontaneously agreed that
</p>
<p>the proscribed members of the National Convention
</p>
<p>should be recalled to the supreme power ; but the mes
</p>
<p>senger was, at the same time, given to understand, that
</p>
<p>all negociation would be broken off, unless the Moun
</p>
<p>tainists would give irrefragable guarantees of their popular
</p>
<p>intentions. They spoke to him without reservation or
</p>
<p>ambiguity, and declared to him that they had little con
</p>
<p>fidence in his colleagues of the Committee, against whom
</p>
<p>very serious objections were urged.
</p>
<p>It was impossible for Ricord to justify the whole of
</p>
<p>his colleagues ; amongst them, to use his own words,
</p>
<p>there were some that did not merit the people's censure.
</p>
<p>The three aforesaid conditions were explained to him, to

<p>which was unanimously added

<p>The suspension of all laws and decrees passed since

<p>the 9th Thermidor of the Year II.

<p>national sovereignty, of which they pretended themselves
</p>
<p>the sole depositaries; the orders which the Directory
</p>
<p>desired to have prescribed to them by the insurgents,
</p>
<p>were, in their estimation, but so many encroachments
</p>
<p>on the rights of the French people, whom it belonged
</p>
<p>to them alone to represent ; they had no objection to
</p>
<p>putting the people in possession of the lodgings and
</p>
<p>goods promised by the Act of Insurrection, but they
</p>
<p>would be understood to concede that point on political
</p>
<p>grounds only, not as though they were executing an order
</p>
<p>or acknowledging a right, but as performing a men: act

<p>of generosity; in fine, they offered the members of the

<p>related, at the same time, that the objections spoken of

<p>by Ricord had been triumphantly refuted by Amar, and
</p>
<p>particularly by Robert Lindet, who, after justifying the

<p>distrust of the Secret Directory, spoke largely on the

<p>necessity of impressing on the Revolution a character

</p>
<p>was one infamous hypocrite, who, in order to ruin the

<p>cause they were devoted to, had maliciously borrowed
</p>
<p>their principles and language. This monster was Georges

<p>himself, of which his knowledge of the levelling projects

<p>of the conspirators would have precluded all hope, or
</p>
<p>whether with the immediate intent of serving tyranny,

<p>Grisel exerted himself to conciliate the confidence of the

<p>nothing less than to disembarrass tyranny for ever of its

<p>Darthe, whom he did not think it prudent to arrest. An

<p>the conspira- orjy served to increase their fancied se

<p>convince them of his honesty, dissipated their alarms and

<p>persuaded them that all new precautions were unneces

<p>the danger it had run ; and in the investigation which it
</p>
<p>hastily instituted to discover the author, it fixed its

<p>suspicions for a moment upon one of the sincerest friends

<p>of the popular cause. Germain had not assisted at the

<p>recollection of his morality, his uniform behaviour, his

<p>sacrifices, and his frankness. All further distrust was
</p>
<p>dissipated by a course of argument suggested to Darthe

<p>by Grisel himself  " If there had been a traitor," said

</p>
<p>which were present Darthe, Eriddy, Germain, Fion,
</p>
<p>Rossignol, Grisel, and all the agents of arrondissements.
</p>
<p>The object of this meeting, which took place at Mas-
</p>
<p>sart's house, was to consult each of those citizens, who
</p>
<p>were all men of tried experience, as to the best means of
</p>
<p>making the insurrectionary movement explode simulta
</p>
<p>neously, and of ensuring its success ; as also to learn
</p>
<p>from each agent an exact account of his resources in
</p>
<p>men, arms, ammunition, and devotion to the cause.
</p>
<p>Claude Fiquet, agent of the sixth Propositions of

</p>
<p>of barricading the faubourg Antoine, in order to pro

<p>tect the dissolution of the troops encamped at Vincennes,

<p>penetrating into the city, if they were hostilely disposed.

</p>
<p>account of the plan of attack proposed by a general
</p>
<p>whom the Secret Directory had engaged him to consult;
</p>
<p>he explained how the Executive Directory might easily

<p>mended that the communication between the faubourgs

</p>
<p>in case of experiencing any serious check.
</p>
<p>Sombod, agent of the eleventh arrondissement, desired
</p>
<p>that the insurrection should take place on a day when
</p>
<p>the decade (Republican sabbath) might fall on a Sun
</p>
<p>day, in order to facilitate the concourse of the workmen
</p>
<p>still attached to the forms of Christian worship, and
</p>
<p>those who had renounced it. He proposed to make use
</p>
<p>of women and children to break the ranks of the
</p>
<p>soldiers, and to entice them to amalgamate and make
</p>
<p>common cause with the people.
</p>
<p>With respect to public opinion, the revolutionary
</p>
<p>agents repeated what they had told the Secret Direc
</p>
<p>tory, namely, that the impatience was general and
</p>
<p>extreme, and that the fall of tyranny was certain, unless
</p>
<p>the soldiers should decide to put the people to the
</p>
<p>sword ; in this case they counted upon the numbers and
</p>
<p>courage of the Democrats, seconded by their maturely
</p>
<p>concerted military dispositions.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the instructions given by
</p>
<p>Committee^de- the agents did not appear sufficient to the
</p>
<p>mands from Military Committee, which, desiring more

<p>reports were to be put into Massart's hands, to be by
</p>
<p>him communicated to a general assembly, appointed
</p>
<p>, the following morning at Dufour's house in the faubourg

<p>would redouble when they saw executed, from the

<p>themselves, and persuaded them that the latter participated in

<p>their aspirations, and desired to effectually second their efforts.

<p>It was owing to their counsels that the project was formed of

<p>appear during and after the insurrection, the Secret
</p>
<p>Directory assumed the title of " Insurrectional Com
</p>
<p>mittee of Public Safety," with the view of restoring the
</p>
<p>forms under which the Robespierrians had prepared the
</p>
<p>way for equality before the 9th Thermidor, and to avoid
</p>
<p>all analogy to those which the aristocracy had instituted.
</p>
<p>The distribution of the insurgent army into three
</p>
<p>divisions had been adopted. Three generals were to
</p>
<p>command them, under the orders of a general-in-chief,
</p>
<p>subject to those of the Insurrectional Committee ; sub
</p>
<p>ordinate to each general of the division were to be placed
</p>
<p>chiefs of arrondissements, and to the latter again, chiefs
</p>
<p>of sections, which in like manner were to be subdivided
</p>
<p>into platoons, with appropriate leaders.
</p>
<p>With respect to generals, the views of the Committee
</p>
<p>were fixed upon Fion, Germain, Rossignol, and Massart.
</p>
<p>The chiefs and commanders of platoons, marked out by
</p>
<p>the same Committee, were to present themselves to
</p>
<p>form the ranks of the people, at the moment when the
</p>
<p>proclamation of the Insurrectional Act, the tocsin
</p>
<p>(alarum-bell), the trumpets, and the shouts of the
</p>
<p>friends of liberty, would have summoned it to the re-
</p>
<p>conquest of its rights.
</p>
<p>The popular army being thus composed, the next step
</p>
<p>was, by the aid of the insurrection, which it was expected
</p>
<p>would be general amongst the labouring classes, to direct
</p>
<p>it against the reigning tyranny, whose forces it was to
</p>
<p>combat. Columns of it were to march on the legislative
</p>
<p>body, on the Executive Directory, on the staff officers,
</p>
<p>and on the hotels of the Ministers, in order to support
</p>
<p>the Republicans charged with arresting the usurpers.
</p>
<p>The best disciplined sections, and those least armed,
</p>
<p>would have been directed towards the depots of arms and
</p>
<p>ammunition, and particularly towards the camps of

<p>Grenelle and Vincennes, where there were no more than
</p>
<p>8,000 men, and even these, it was believed, were ready
</p>
<p>to join the people.
</p>
<p>To hasten this junction, it was proposed to employ the
</p>
<p>display of a grand force as well as the language of per
</p>
<p>suasion; orators were to remind the soldiers of the crimes
</p>
<p>of the Government, and of their duties towards their
</p>
<p>country; the women were to present them with garlands

</p>
<p>and refreshments ; the Invalides to invite them to follow
</p>
<p>their example. If the worst happened, preparations
</p>
<p>were made for barricading the streets  for showering *
</p>
<p>upon the troops torrents of boiling water mixed with
</p>
<p>vitriol, besides stones, slates, tiles, and bricks.
</p>
<p>The rest of the popular army was to be employed in
</p>
<p>guarding the entrances to Paris  in maintaining commu
</p>
<p>nications between the different bodies of the people  in
</p>
<p>protecting the provisions intended for the city  in prevent

<p>ing all anti-popular gatherings  in intercepting all aristo

<p>cratic correspondence  in checking all attempts at pillage,
</p>
<p>and in executing the orders of the insurrectional authorities*
</p>
<p>Unforeseen accidents, like those which caused the
</p>
<p>disasters of Prairial, might possibly render doubtful the
</p>
<p>success of the enterprise, if measures were not taken to
</p>
<p>prevent them. Accordingly, did the Insurrectional
</p>
<p>Committee consider of the means of abundantly pro
</p>
<p>visioning all the places where the people was to assemble,
</p>
<p>and it was principally with this intent that it had decided
</p>
<p>upon installing in each section, from the outset of the
</p>
<p>insurrection, three members of the Revolutionary Com
</p>
<p>mittee, which was in activity up to the 9th Thermidor,
</p>
<p>and whose duty would be to instantly place at the disposal
</p>
<p>of the insurgent citizens, whatever meat and drink they
</p>
<p>might require, by seizing the provisions deposited at all
</p>
<p>the public and private stores, and to execute on the
</p>
<p>spot the first offices of kindly relief promised by the con

<p>spirators to the unhappy poor.
</p>
<p>For the purpose of giving the people a Lodging and

<p>of strengthening its zeal, the Insurrec

<p>to whom should be left only the accommodation indis

<p>pensable in that way.
</p>
<p>* It would be wrong to confound the regular distribution of
</p>
<p>lodging and clothes with pillage, which is opposed to all amelio

<p>ration by the irreparable losses it causes to society, by the new

<p>inequalities it produces, by the demoralization it fosters and

</p>
<p>It is right to make known the idea Punishment of
</p>
<p>formed by the Insurrectional Committee
</p>
<p>of the public sentence to which it desired to subject the
</p>
<p>most guilty of the people's enemies, that is to say, the
</p>
<p>members of the two Councils, and those of the Executive
</p>
<p>Directory. The crime was manifest  the penalty was
</p>
<p>death  a grand example was necessary. Nevertheless,
</p>
<p>this example should bear the stamp of rigorous justice,
</p>
<p>and of a profound feeling for the public good. It was
</p>
<p>agreed that the insurgent people should have read to it a
</p>
<p>full and detailed account of the treasons it had been the
</p>
<p>victim of, and should be invited to except from proscrip
</p>
<p>tion those of the accused, in extenuation of whose
</p>
<p>political faults excusable error might be pleaded, or
</p>
<p>simple and popular manners, or some brilliant service
</p>
<p>rendered to equality during the insurrection. According
</p>
<p>to some opinions in the Insurrectional Committee, the
</p>
<p>condemned were to be buried under the ruins of their
</p>
<p>palaces ; which ruins were to be left in that state as a
</p>
<p>monument to the latest posterity of the just punishment
</p>
<p>inflicted on the enemies of equality.
</p>
<p>Every measure of attack and defence was about being
</p>
<p>signified to the agents of arrondissements, and to the
</p>
<p>generals the Committee was upon the point of naming.
</p>
<p>From the happy termination of the insurrection was ne
</p>
<p>cessarily to flow a new order of things, some substrata
</p>
<p>for which it was necessary to lay beforehand, in order to
</p>
<p>prepare for the most urgent wants; the Insurrectional
</p>
<p>Committee had made them the subject of its meditations.
</p>
<p>We have seen how, previously to its coalition with the
</p>
<p>Mountainists, it counted upon getting established, by the
</p>
<p>people in insurrection, the new Authority and the rules
</p>
<p>of its conduct. To the changes rendered necessary by

<p>of the Mountainists, caused others to be added.
</p>
<p>To triumph over tyranny would have been nothing,
</p>
<p>unless there were a certainty that it would be replaced
</p>
<p>by guides animated with the purest love of equality. It
</p>
<p>was necessary to have men whose doctrines, morals, and
</p>
<p>entire life were in perfect harmony with the institutions
</p>
<p>they were summoned to create.
</p>
<p>According to its first system, the Insurrectional Com-

</p>
<p>mittee was certain that the spirit which animated it
</p>
<p>would pass effectually and fully into the new National
</p>
<p>Assembly, and in that consisted the strongest guarantee
</p>
<p>it could offer the people of the approaching establish
</p>
<p>ment of equality, and of the popular Constitution of
</p>
<p>1793. But from the moment it was de- xhe equivoca-
</p>
<p>cided to recal a part of the Convention, conduct of the

<p>the Insurrectional Committee believed it Mountainists

<p>to be its duty to fortify the people against precautions ne-

<p>the seductions of the new authority. The cessary.
</p>
<p>reproaches which it urged againsts the Mountainists
</p>
<p>sufficiently prove that it was far from reposing confidence
</p>
<p>in them.
</p>
<p>To the old grounds of distrust, the recent conduct of
</p>
<p>these Conventionahsts added new ones. The Committee
</p>
<p>had been struck by the subtility with which they en
</p>
<p>deavoured to evade the proposed adjunction, by the
</p>
<p>haughtiness they carried into the discussions, and by that
</p>
<p>aristocratic pride which made them call the restitution
</p>
<p>of the people's rights a gratuitous concession. Moreover,
</p>
<p>it was informed that manoeuvres were being clandestinely
</p>
<p>practiced, with a view to elude the conditions agreed
</p>
<p>upon, and to make the supreme authority of the Repub
</p>
<p>hc fall exclusively into the hands of the Mountainists.
</p>
<p>The Committee was now so strongly convinced of the
</p>
<p>impossibility of these Mountainists effecting any good,
</p>
<p>that it regarded as an unpardonable crime the least
</p>
<p>movement, which bv delivering power into their hands
</p>
<p>would be only substituting one tyranny for another.
</p>
<p>They considered then of the means of forcing the
</p>
<p>recalled Conventionalists to abide by their promises, and
</p>
<p>to throw no obstacle in the way of an effective and per
</p>
<p>manent equality. It was by the people that the con

<p>spirators had hoped to overthrow tyranny. It was by the
</p>
<p>ascendancy of truth that they had obtained the support of
</p>
<p>the people, and it was now again by the aid of truth and
</p>
<p>the people that they resolved to baffle the new machina
</p>
<p>tions. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Thedispositions
</p>
<p>Insurrectional Act, by which a part of the i(m ^erelo^be
</p>
<p>National Convention was recalled to the sanctioned by
</p>
<p>evprcise of power, the Committee wished *{"fl vosce f
</p>
<p>r ' the people.
</p>
<p>146 babeuf's CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>that it should be re-established by the express will of the
</p>
<p>people in insurrection ; that by the same authority should
</p>
<p>the stipulated adjunction be solemnly decreed, and
</p>
<p>the additional Deputies named. It wished, besides, that
</p>
<p>the same people should order the magistrates in authority
</p>
<p>before the 9th Thermidor to instantly resume their func
</p>
<p>tions ; that it should confirm all the insurrectional dis
</p>
<p>positions, prescribe the prompt execution of the decrees
</p>
<p>of the Committee concerning the lodging and clothing
</p>
<p>of the poor, and directly instal the new Convention after
</p>
<p>having pronounced the grand decree already spoken of.
</p>
<p>To this effect, the Insurrectional Committee had re
</p>
<p>commended its agents to direct all their cares to produce,
</p>
<p>immediately after the overthrow of tyranny, a concourse
</p>
<p>of all the citizens round the place where it would hold
</p>
<p>assembly. There the Committee would have rendered
</p>
<p>account to the people of all it had done to break the
</p>
<p>new yoke imposed on the nation, and demanded of it
</p>
<p>the decrees it might judge necessary for the safety of the
</p>
<p>Republic. The discourse which one of the members was
</p>
<p>to pronounce upon that grand occasion was actually
</p>
<p>drawn up, and was about to be submitted to examina

<p>tion.Discussion on A very delicate point was maturely dis-

<p>or equivocation, and to pay the most striking homage to
</p>
<p>its sovereignty. Had it deemed it necessary, to the
</p>
<p>complete success of the insurrection, to be temporarily
</p>
<p>invested with the whole national power, it would not
</p>
<p>have hesitated to demand it. But every institution of

</p>
<p>this sort having been previously rejected, it remained
</p>
<p>only to examine whether it would be expedient to re
</p>
<p>commend the people in insurrection to institute a
</p>
<p>numerically small body, authorized to propose legislative
</p>
<p>measures to the new Convention, whose decrees it would
</p>
<p>execute, or whether it would be more expedient to com
</p>
<p>mit this important care to the Convention itself. What
</p>
<p>ever might have been the decision of the Insurrectional
</p>
<p>babeuf's conspiracy. 147
</p>
<p>Committee, it would be still necessary to ask itself
</p>
<p>whether the success of the new Revolution did not
</p>
<p>require that its members should exclusively compose the
</p>
<p>contemplated body in question.
</p>
<p>There having been no resolution come to in this
</p>
<p>respect, I can only record the arguments by which the ,
</p>
<p>Committee had compared the advantages and incon
</p>
<p>veniences of the different plans proposed for adoption.
</p>
<p>It will occur, in the first instance, that the conversion
</p>
<p>of the Insurrectional Initiative into a permanent, and
</p>
<p>necessarily very extended power, would expose the
</p>
<p>members of the Insurrectional Committee to the sus
</p>
<p>picion of having ambitious and interested views ; it was
</p>
<p>feared that inculpations of this kind would, by the
</p>
<p>readiness with which they are credited and propagated,
</p>
<p>only obstruct their march, and leave them no time to
</p>
<p>realize the good proposed. And it was asked, whether
</p>
<p>the presence of the conspirators in the new Convention,
</p>
<p>their ultimate union, and the general confidence be
</p>
<p>stowed upon them, would not suffice to impart to the
</p>
<p>laws the spirit of their enterprize, and to raise to the
</p>
<p>supreme executive power magistrates worthy of exer
</p>
<p>cising its functions ?
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Insurrectional Committee saw
</p>
<p>but few men in whom purity of principle was to be found
</p>
<p>united with courage, with firmness, and the intelligence
</p>
<p>necessary to reduce them to practice ; it felt how dan
</p>
<p>gerous it would be not to leave the completion of so
</p>
<p>hazardous a work to those who had had the boldness to
</p>
<p>commence it, and it dreaded the duplicity of certain per
</p>
<p>sons with whom it was about to find itself in competition.
</p>
<p>After having long hesitated, our conspirators had almost
</p>
<p>decided upon demanding from the people a decree by
</p>
<p>which the initiative and the execution of the laws should

<p>be exclusively confided to them.
</p>
<p>Several of our projects remained imperfect ; many
</p>
<p>useful undertakings were cut short by the treason which
</p>
<p>delivered over to the vengeance of the aristocracy the
</p>
<p>men whom circumstances had carried to the head of the
</p>
<p>Democratic Party ; and the history of their conspiracy
</p>
<p>might be terminated here, were it not necessary, in

<p> seventy thorough Democrats and Equahtarians, all of
</p>
<p>' them irrevocably pledged by the principles of their lives,
</p>
<p>and the aspirations of the surrounding people, to lay the
</p>
<p>foundation of a solid and enduring equality. By the
</p>
<p>side of it, the Insurrectional Committee, seconded by
</p>
<p>j the magistrates installed by the insurrection, would have
</p>
<p>presided, at least provisionally, over the execution of the
</p>
<p>Act which was to put the citizens in movement ; at its
</p>
<p>call the enormous mass of Parisian poor would have been
</p>
<p>suddenly transferred from their cells and garrets into

<p>healthy and commodious habitations. The unhappy
</p>
<p>poor would have been supplied with clothing, and their
</p>
<p>goods and furniture in pledge at the pawn-offices would
</p>
<p>be gratuitously restored to them. At the same time
</p>
<p>diligent care would have been taken to ensure abundant

<p>subsistence ; the principles of the new Revolution would
</p>
<p>have been explained to the citizens in the assemblies to

<p>be forthwith re-opened ;* a numerous popular guard

<p>would have repressed the ill-intentioned, and facilitated

<p>To the preparatory steps judged necessary to over
</p>
<p>throw the scaffolding erected by the new aristocracy, it
</p>
<p>would have been necessary to add those others which ap- '
</p>
<p>peared best calculated to render the Revolution of Paris
</p>
<p>common to the whole Republic, and to establish
</p>
<p>throughout the institutions of equality and popular so
</p>
<p>vereignty. From the first moment of its appoint- The depart
</p>
<p>ment, the Insurrectional Committee had ments-
</p>
<p>made the departments and the armies the subject of its
</p>
<p>meditations ; it had circulated its writings in all quarters ;
</p>
<p>the Democrats were everywhere apprised of its projects,
</p>
<p>and everywhere prepared to co-operate. There was in
</p>
<p>the hands of one of its members a voluminous cor- '

<p>respondence which indicated the places were the Demo

<p>crats were in force, and the men in whom most
</p>
<p>confidence could be placed ; information was received

</p>
<p>the shades of opinion that had hitherto divided them,
</p>
<p>were rallying one and all to the standard of pure
</p>
<p>equality. With respect to the armies, the Committee was well
</p>
<p>aware how difficult the commissaries of the Convention
</p>
<p>had found the task of stifling amongst them, after thev
</p>
<p>9th Thermidor, what they called the spirit of anarchy
</p>
<p>and insubordination ;"' neither was it ignorant that the
</p>
<p>Constitution of the Year III. had raised murmurs
</p>
<p>throughout whole armies (avait fait murmurer des
</p>
<p>armees entieres) ; it was informed that the soldiers
</p>
<p>obeyed with repugnance the commands of the officers
</p>
<p>that succeeded those destituted after the 9th Thermidor,
</p>
<p>and that amongst the chiefs, of whom some corresponded

</p>
<p>magistrates, so that all might find themselves subject to
</p>
<p>duties equally proportioned to their strength, and to the

<p>rudeness of the labour they might have to perform.
</p>
<p>Mitigation of Fearing that the diversity of occupa-
</p>
<p>painful labour, tions might produce for certain classes too
</p>
<p>sensible an increase, or surfeit of labour, it was con
</p>
<p>sidered  1st. That it would be expedient to call in the
</p>
<p>sciences to soften the labour of man, by the invention of
</p>
<p>new machines and the perfecting of old ones.* 2d. That
</p>
<p>it would be right to charge, in turn, all the able-bodied
</p>
<p>citizens with the more repulsive occupations, the dis-
</p>
<p>agreeableness of which, it was hoped, would be progres
</p>
<p>sively but rapidly diminished by a masculine education,
</p>
<p>and by the assistance of mechanism, chemistry, and the
</p>
<p>physical sciences in general.
</p>
<p>Probably it would have been found convenient to dis
</p>
<p>tinguish the works of strict necessity into easy and painful,
</p>
<p>and to oblige each citizen to exercise one of one class,
</p>
<p>and one of the other. Probably it might have been also
</p>
<p>just to establish another division of citizens, according to
</p>
<p>age, for the purpose of proportioning the weight of labour
</p>
<p>to the increase and diminution of strength ; for, in matters
</p>
<p>of this kind, equality ought to be measured and deter
</p>
<p>mined less by the intensity of the labour required than by
</p>
<p>the capacity of the labourer.
</p>
<p>* It is only in the system of community that the use of ma
</p>
<p>chines can prove a real benefit to humanity, by diminishing the
</p>
<p>labours of man, while, at the same time it augments the abundance
</p>
<p>of things necessary and agreeable. At present, machines, by su
</p>
<p>perseding a vast deal of manual labour, have only the effect of
</p>
<p>depriving multitudes of men of bread, for the advantage of certain

<p>the benefits of the equality to be established by the laws ;

</p>
<p>aged and infirm are placed in the rank of the principal
</p>
<p>duties of society. In return for these good offices, the
</p>
<p>Repubhc would receive lessons of experience from the
</p>
<p>old, and make them subjects of emulation for the young;
</p>
<p>they were destined, in fact, to become the guardians of
</p>
<p>morals and of the laws, the censors of public manners,
</p>
<p>and the conservators of virtue.
</p>
<p>One of the effects of these institutions would have
</p>
<p>been, I think, to attach the citizens so strongly to them,
</p>
<p>that the love of country would have become their pre
</p>
<p>dominant passion. By education, the legislator would
</p>
<p>have been able to render all affections of family and
</p>
<p>kindred subordinate to this sentiment ; he could have
</p>
<p>rendered it so intense and active, that the truly fraternal
</p>
<p>union of all Frenchmen would, in all probability, have
</p>
<p>been its happy and astounding consequence. This re
</p>
<p>flection constituted the delight of our conspirators, and
</p>
<p>was the animating soul of all their projects. I remember
</p>
<p>one occasion, when, in the midst of a discussion on the
</p>
<p>advantages and inconveniences of family ties, the pro
</p>
<p>position was formally made to forbid children to bear the
</p>
<p>name of a father that had not distinguished himself by
</p>
<p>great virtues.
</p>
<p>Thus, what was to embellish the declining years of old
</p>
<p>age would have also strengthened the virtue of the young,
</p>
<p>and from this reciprocity of advantage, joined to the
</p>
<p>happy effects of an education in common for all, at the
</p>
<p>public charge, the country would have derived an aug
</p>
<p>mentation of power from every increase of its population
</p>
<p> an augmentation progressive and sure, as there would

<p>source of man- the mould of national manners lay in
</p>
<p>the common education, which they placed

<p>the young people would have found the same sentiments,
</p>
<p>the same opinions, and the same usages, which they had
</p>
<p>been taught to love in the early days of life. I will
</p>
<p>speak of this education after I shall have given a more
</p>
<p>complete idea of the superstructure of which it was to be
</p>
<p>the eternal base.

<p>We have seen that the employments Works not sub-

</p>
<p>the different classes of workers, that each would have its
</p>
<p>own department. But there are other employments to
</p>
<p>which it is expedient, for the maintenance of liberty, that
</p>
<p>all the citizens should be invited to take part in turn 
</p>
<p>viz., such as appertain to the administration and defence
</p>
<p>of the Republic.
</p>
<p>The Insurrectional Committee was of ^i'^110" 9f
</p>
<p>opinion that equality and liberty could ^d defence' 0'f

<p>not be maintained in society unless all the country,

<p>with a share of the pubhc administration, and were

<p>the end of society be completely attained, it is necessary
</p>
<p>that its practical results should be from time to time
</p>
<p>applied by the laws to the improvement of the public

<p>comes one of the most important duties of the founder
</p>
<p>of a Republic to place all the citizens in a capacity to
</p>
<p>exercise it ; that is to say, to give the people the means
</p>
<p>of being really sovereign. The enlightened decisions of
</p>
<p>the people on general objects could never run counter to
</p>
<p>equality, or to the well-being of society (since no people

<p>would knowingly legislate against themselves) ; but to be

<p>and to continue enlightened, they should be formed under

<p>a regime in which equality exists in the fullest sense of

<p>the word.

<p>From this fundamental duty emanate for every citizen

<p>three species of occupations, which, by the importance

<p>tion, as also with the training of youth; at present I will
</p>
<p>confine myself to describing the career intended for the

<p>young people after they had quitted the common halls

<p>of education, through which all should pass.

</p>
<p>magistrates charged with the execution of the sovereign
</p>
<p>will. These rights cannot be exercised, nor these func
</p>
<p>tions properly discharged, unless by well-informed, expe
</p>
<p>rienced, and prudent men. Thus, according to the plan
</p>
<p>of the Insurrectional Committee, the legislature was to
</p>
<p>prescribe the age under which no man could participate
</p>
<p>in the sovereign power or in the magisterial authority : *
</p>
<p>it was even proposed to interdict from the exercise of
</p>
<p>civic rights all who could not furnish proofs of their ca
</p>
<p>pacity ; but the fear of thereby affording a pretext for
</p>
<p>the exclusion of a vast number of citizens, made the
</p>
<p>Committee reject it, and the more determinedly, because
</p>
<p>its members were convinced that, real equality once"
</p>
<p>established, the multiplicity and opposition of interests
</p>
<p>would be annihilated, and the art of government so sim
</p>
<p>plified, as to be brought within the capacity of anybody
</p>
<p>and everybody.
</p>
<p>In coming out of the halls of education, the youth of
</p>
<p>France would not have been inconsiderately thrown into
</p>
<p>the Comitia ;* it was expected they should first attend *
</p>
<p>them for some time in silence, and in a place marked
</p>
<p>out for the purpose, in order to learn the forms and order
</p>
<p>of debate, and to acquire habits of gravity and decency.
</p>
<p>It was also desired that, before being invested with the most
</p>
<p>precious of all social rights, that of voting for the laws,
</p>
<p>the young people should frequent unions, wherein it
</p>
<p>would have been lawful for every one to speak his opinion ;
</p>
<p>there they would have heard men deeply versed in the
</p>
<p>science of law, and perused such books as the Republic
</p>
<p>would have provided for the purpose. Moreover, they
</p>
<p>should not have arrived at the exercise of the suffrage
</p>
<p>without having served a certain time in military affairs at
</p>
<p>the camps ; the youth would have been constantly in
</p>
<p>the presence, as it were, of their country, which, never

<p>their part, thus presuming a consent which ought to
</p>
<p>have so great an influence on their future lives. It was
</p>
<p>considered, that the submission of every one to the laws
</p>
<p>of the society of which he forms part, ought to be the
</p>
<p>result, formally expressed, of a free and enlightened will.
</p>
<p>For this purpose, it thought of establishing a solemnity,
</p>
<p>by which the reciprocal engagements of society towards
</p>
<p>the citizens, and of the citizens towards society, would
</p>
<p>have been formally verified.
</p>
<p>On stated days, young men of the requisite age, and

<p>to the conditions  they would have contracted a solemn

</p>
<p>they would have received the tokens of their new con

</p>
<p>the country against invasion is an essential part of the
</p>
<p>wisdom of laws ; for the best internal institutions would
</p>
<p>offer no safeguard to a people unskilled in war, against
</p>
<p>the attack of an unjust and warlike neighbour. But if,
</p>
<p>on the one hand, arms are useful to the Republic, they
</p>
<p>become, on the other, very disastrous to it, when

<p>tyranny. To prevent so dangerous an abuse, it is good

<p>policy to give arms to all fhtf citizens, and to render all

<p>be exhausted.
</p>
<p>The labour of all the valid citizens would, no doubt,
</p>
<p>produce far beyond the wants of the public, since, even
</p>
<p>under the existing order of things, there are so many
</p>
<p>idle people, and so many useful things converted into
</p>
<p>superfluities. To obviate unforeseen accidents then, it
</p>
<p>is only necessary to gather up, and preserve the super-
</p>
<p>176 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>abundance of fertile years, now-a-days almost entirely
</p>
<p>dissipated in frivolous customs, which, by flattering
</p>
<p>pride, vanity, and depraved tastes, render us wicked and
</p>
<p>unhappy. From its ready knowledge of the state of production
</p>
<p>and demand, the Supreme Administration deduces the
</p>
<p>arrangements necessary to guarantee everywhere a suffi
</p>
<p>cient supply of provisions, and to provide also for the
</p>
<p>unforeseen wants of the future. As matters stand now,
</p>
<p>nothing is more rare than exactness in such surveys, be
</p>
<p>cause every one, believing himself less exposed to adver
</p>
<p>sity in proportion as he piles up, endeavours by false
</p>
<p>declarations to withdraw his substance from the public
</p>
<p>charges. But in our system, where the sole proprietor
</p>
<p>ship of the country replaces individual properties, it being
</p>
<p>impossible for any man to be tranquil as regards the
</p>
<p>future, unless the Republic be rich, and able to ad
</p>
<p>minister and distribute with equity the fruits of the com
</p>
<p>mon labour, the same anxiety, which now causes men to
</p>
<p>think only of themselves, invites them to approach one
</p>
<p>another, to mix together, to lend mutual succours, and
</p>
<p>to communicate to one another without mystery or
</p>
<p>fraud their wants and their resources. Let all the cir
</p>
<p>cumstances, said the Committee, be duly weighed, and
</p>
<p>it will be seen that the advantages of the social state are
</p>
<p>almost annihilated by the introduction of private pro
</p>
<p>perty, and that it is only when that institution shall have
</p>
<p>been abolished, that each individual will feel how much
</p>
<p>he is interested in the well-being of all his associates.
</p>
<p>The science of government, which the collision of so
</p>
<p>many opposing interests renders at present so very in
</p>
<p>tricate, is reduced by the system of community to a simple
</p>
<p>calculation scarcely beyond the capacity of an ordinary

</p>
<p>times of abundance, our Republic would have provided

</p>
<p>for unforeseen accidents ; upon the least appearance of
</p>
<p>external danger, the subsistence necessary for the armies
</p>
<p>would have been abstracted from the depdts, to be
</p>
<p>transported to the places where the troops were mus
</p>
<p>tering. Under the existing order of things, whenever we want
</p>
<p>to prepare for war, our greatest difficulty is not to direct
</p>
<p>BABEUF S CONSPIRACY. 177
</p>
<p>the movements of the aimed bodies, but to assemble
</p>
<p>them and subsist them.
</p>
<p>If we succeed so far as to overcome in some degree
</p>
<p>the resistance opposed to us by effeminacy and selfishness,
</p>
<p>a great deal remains still to be done in the way of raising
</p>
<p>money, which is contributed with reluctance, and in
</p>
<p>ensuring provisions of every kind, either by direct pur
</p>
<p>chase, which the sudden rise of prices and the inevitable
</p>
<p>peculations of agents render very burdensome, or through
</p>
<p>the medium of contractors, whose insatiable and crafty cu
</p>
<p>pidity nothing can satisfy. Sometimes, indeed, the fear
</p>
<p>of a foreign yoke kindles, at least for a time, the love cf
</p>
<p>country, and favours the raising of extraordinary contri
</p>
<p>butions, but it is only by inflicting a disastrous wound on
</p>
<p>agriculture and industry, that the means are procured
</p>
<p>for repelling foreign aggression.*
</p>
<p>In the political system of our conspirators all these
</p>
<p>difficulties disappear. The provisioning of the armies is
</p>
<p>always at hand, and the armed bodies always ready at a
</p>
<p>moment's warning to march to the frontiers, without any
</p>
<p>necessity for the citizens to make the least retrenchment
</p>
<p>in their mode of living; their numbers remaining the
</p>
<p>same, the consumption of the whole is not increased,
</p>
<p>wherever that consumption may take place.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if a second or third cam- Extraordinary
</p>
<p>paign were necessary, since the mass of resources.
</p>
<p>labour necessary to be done, and the number of consumers
</p>
<p>would remain undiminished, whilst a part of the citizens
</p>
<p>was engaged in non-productive occupations, there would
</p>
<p>ultimately result in the provisioning department, a deficit
</p>
<p>which might become a cause of calamities and disorder.
</p>
<p>To remedy this, a new application of the principles of
</p>
<p>equality furnishes new resourses. Since the citizens en
</p>
<p>gaged in war bear a burden to which nothing can possibly

<p>be added, it is just that, by a fresh repartition of the
</p>
<p>common industry, an increase should take place in the
</p>
<p>labour of those who do not take arms. A half-hour or

<p>of the burden which the most calamitous war could entail
</p>
<p>on the people. " Let there be shown to us," exclaimed
</p>
<p>some of the conspirators, " any other social order in
</p>
<p>which such grai d effects are produced, by means so
</p>
<p>simple and of such easy execution."

<p> From the facility with which a people,

</p>
<p>against the living under such institutions, would be
</p>
<p>abuse of war. able to develope its strength, it would be
</p>
<p>wrong to conclude that it would be therefore disposed to
</p>
<p>disturb the quiet of its neighbours. On the contrary,
</p>
<p>the presumption is that it would impose restraints on
</p>
<p>itself, either to prevent precipitation and injustice in the
</p>
<p>declaration of war, or to direct the conduct of its warriors
</p>
<p>during the existence of hostilities. Probably, such a
</p>
<p>people would never wage war, unless to repel invasion,
</p>
<p>or to support a neighbouring power unjustly oppressed.
</p>
<p>Content with the riches of a fertile soil, and containing
</p>
<p>in its bosom neither beggars nor rogues, for what purpose
</p>
<p>could it be tempted to dispute with its neighbours for
</p>
<p>productions which it neither required nor would know
</p>
<p>now to dispose of? Agricultural, simple, happy, and at
</p>
<p>tached to the manners, and to its laws, the love of pillage
</p>
<p>would be as foreign to it as the passion for conquests ; and
</p>
<p>its commercial institutions could never expose it to
</p>
<p>espouse the quarrels of its merchants  a race of vampires

<p>himself. History informs us that military glory was most frequently
</p>
<p>the footstool of tyranny. The necessity of bridling the military
</p>
<p>spirit by laws andmanners, is rendered greater by the circumstance
</p>
<p>that conquest and pillage corrupt the citizens, drive the vanquished
</p>
<p>to despair and vengeance, taint public opinion with a false ambition
</p>
<p>under the names chivalry and honour, and elevate above the laws
</p>
<p>rebel chiefs, who dare to exercise upon the country the despotism
</p>
<p>to which they had fashioned the soldiers, under pretence of dis
</p>
<p>ciplining them. These traitors, aided by the passion for money
</p>
<p>and distinctions, which they craftily foment in their imprudent
</p>
<p>companions in arms, sow everywhere the seeds of corruption,

</p>
<p>of the enemy; the intent was to preserve the nation from
</p>
<p>the corruption which the spoils of victory draw in their
</p>
<p>train ; that all individual booty should be interdicted, and
</p>
<p>that every soldier should be obliged to carry to the public
</p>
<p>depot whatever might fall into his hands. It was well
</p>
<p>understood, however, that the best security against military
</p>
<p>licentiousness would be found in the contempt entertained
</p>
<p>for the treasures of slaves a contempt which the ge
</p>
<p>neral education would have engraved on all hearts. In
</p>
<p>the tent  in the field  in the midst of battle, the citizen
</p>
<p>soldier would have had no other passion than the love of
</p>
<p>equality and of country, and no other guide than the
</p>
<p>laws. To the love of their Republic the con- Respect for the
</p>
<p>spirators united that of humanity, to the law of natl0ns'
</p>
<p>well-being of which all their projects fundamentally
</p>
<p>tended. Had their wishes been fulfilled, it would not
</p>
<p>have been their fault if the same spirit of equality and
</p>
<p>of justice, which was to reign amongst the citizens, did
</p>
<p>not direct the conduct of the Republic towards foreigners.
</p>
<p>They desired that the French people, considering itself
</p>
<p>as a member of the great human society, should con
</p>
<p>tribute, by its wisdom and by its example, to ensure
</p>
<p>universal peace, and to procure respect in all places for
</p>
<p>the rights which nature has accorded to all men alike.
</p>
<p>Occupations having for their object the administration
</p>
<p>and defence of the State, are not less essential than those
</p>
<p>which contribute to satisfy the wants of men, because
</p>
<p>without them internal order could not be maintained,
</p>
<p>nor external dangers prevented. Besides, they are duties
</p>
<p>for all, since, if they were otherwise, they would soon
</p>
<p>cease to have for their sole object the public interest.

</p>
<p>Advantages of The Committee desired, that in the
</p>
<p>frequent meet- Republic, the citizens should do in common
</p>
<p>ings of citizens. whatever was to be done. The presence,
</p>
<p>it observed, of a numerous and incorruptible pubhc, checks
</p>
<p>the secret impulses of selfishness, makes the want of
</p>
<p>mutual co-operation more sensibly felt, and fosters in
</p>
<p>the heart of each the desire of obtaining the geaeral ap
</p>
<p>probation, by punctuality in the discharge of his duties.
</p>
<p>If relaxation or recreation be the object, it is in the very
</p>
<p>genius of equality to value pleasure only in proportion as
</p>
<p>it is shared by all. Thus, have free people frequent
</p>
<p>assemblies, while slaves have none. The amount of
</p>
<p>happiness in a state increases in proportion as public
</p>
<p>amusements are more preferred, and, as there exists a
</p>
<p>less disposition to shut oneself up, and become insensible
</p>
<p>to the sufferings and to the ennui of the multitude.
</p>
<p>Under a wise legislature, the events of nature, of life,
</p>
<p>and of society, are rendered so many occasions for in
</p>
<p>struction and amusement. By the one, he invites the
</p>
<p>attention of the citizens to the works of the Divinity,
</p>
<p>and to the wonders of the social system. By the others,
</p>
<p>he celebrates the virtues of great men, and excites an
</p>
<p>ambition to imitate them. At one time he inflames
</p>
<p>courage, at another he kindles the love of equality ; and,
</p>
<p>by incessantly occupying the soul with sublime objects,
</p>
<p>he preserves it from those appetites and corrupt passions
</p>
<p>which enervate and deprave it.

<p>their objects the exercise of sovereign power, of the
</p>
<p>judicial functions, and of the public administration. I
</p>
<p>have already alluded to it, and shall revert again to the
</p>
<p>subject, in rendering account of the form of Govern
</p>
<p>ment. The assemblies of the second class had reference
</p>
<p>to the military order, of which I have spoken. To the
</p>
<p>third belonged exclusively the assemblies destined for
</p>
<p>instruction. I will say more of it, in treating of educa-
</p>
<p>BABEUF'S CONSPIRACY. 181
</p>
<p>tion, and the development of the intellectual faculties.
</p>
<p>Finally, by those of the fourth class, the Committee pro
</p>
<p>posed to nourish and strengthen the love of virtue in the
</p>
<p>hearts of the French people. I shall attempt a brief
</p>
<p>description of the ideas formed by the Committee on
</p>
<p>these points.
</p>
<p>It began by turning its eyes to the most re- Festivals.
</p>
<p>markable events of civil life, and judged it to be con
</p>
<p>formable to the spirit of its institutions to make such
</p>
<p>events the subjects of so many popular festivals. The
</p>
<p>union of the sexes, the presentation of new born in
</p>
<p>fants, the entrance of children into the houses of
</p>
<p>education, the departure of the youth for the fron
</p>
<p>tiers, their return, and admission to the rank of
</p>
<p>citizenship,  all these and the like events would have
</p>
<p>given place to pubhc solemnities celebrated in every part
</p>
<p>of France. In case of war, the departure of the war
</p>
<p>riors, the rendering of honours to the defenders of the
</p>
<p>country fallen in battle, and the triumphs to be
</p>
<p>decreed to the most valiant, would have given occasion
</p>
<p>to other festivals, calculated to exalt the soul, and to
</p>
<p>preserve the martial spirit of arms.
</p>
<p>Other assemblies were destined by the Assemblies -of- ~
</p>
<p>Committee to foster the desire of appro- ce-nsors iP.-..~>-
</p>
<p>bation, and the fear of pubhc censure. At certain pre
</p>
<p>scribed times, a species of censorship would have been
</p>
<p>exercised on the conduct of the citizens, and principally
</p>
<p>on that of the magistrates. We have seen that the con
</p>
<p>sent of the people would have been necessary for the
</p>
<p>enrolment of the youth on the civic register. The same
</p>

</p>
<p>and to their country. As to worship, they wished it to be limited
</p>
<p>to respect for the social compact, to the defence of equality, and
</p>
<p>to certain public festivals. All pretended revelations would have
</p>
<p>been disavowed by the laws the same as other public maladies, the

<p>seeds of which it was necessary to gradually extirpate. Meanwhile,
</p>
<p>every one would have been free to follow his own religious vagaries,
</p>
<p>provided public order, general fraternity, and the authority of the
</p>
<p>laws, were not disturbed. Such was the religious doctrine of the
</p>
<p>principal defenders of equality during the French Revolution ,
</p>
<p>such was that of Robespierre, who owed, in a great measure, to
</p>
<p>the courage with which he defended it, the bloody proscription of

<p>[There was no period of the French Revolution in which the
</p>
<p>career of an exalted and benevolent legislator was rendered more
</p>
<p>painful and perilous than during the fanatic orgies of the A theists,
</p>
<p>towards the close of 1793 and in the beginning of 1794. The
</p>
<p>hatred of the old superstition, inspired by the recollection of its
</p>
<p>countless crimes against liberty and happiness, became so furious
</p>
<p>and indiscriminating, that, in their rage to extirpate all traces of
</p>
<p>it, many of the inflamed patriots plunged headlong into the oppo
</p>
<p>site extreme of Atheism. Not content with destroying all vestiges
</p>
<p>of the Catholic worship, and proscribing its priests, the fanatic
</p>
<p>multitude was impelled to make war on the Divinity, by denying
</p>
<p>his existence, and seeking to make a religion of Atheism itself,
</p>
<p>under the form of a sort of demi-pagan worship, instituted in ho
</p>
<p>nour of reason. This popular madness, which went to confound
</p>
<p>the Deity with the crimes committed in his name by sacerdotal
</p>
<p>impostors, occasioned the bitterest sorrow in the more enlightened
</p>
<p>friends of equality. One of the objects of the Revolution was to
</p>
<p>establish liberty of conscience, but the Atheists outvied even the
</p>
<p>fanatics of the old religion in persecution and intolerance. They
</p>
<p>broke open the churches, demolished the altars, stripped the clergy
</p>
<p>of their vestments, and, adding barbarous insult to cruelty, paraded
</p>
<p>asses in the robes of the priests, and presented the chalice to them
</p>
<p>to drink in derision of the ceremony of the mass. Robespierre
</p>
<p>witnessed these disgusting orgies  these outrageous invasions

<p>of liberty, with horror and indignation. He saw that they were

</p>
<p>but what was of more immediate consequence, to produce sym
</p>
<p>pathy, and a consequent reaction, in favour of the priests and

<p>superstition. The Convention having decreed the worship of

<p>Reason, at the instance of the Commune, which encouraged the
</p>
<p>atheistic party, Robespierre denounced the extravagant and per

<p>secuting proceedings of the leaders of that body, and, at his sug
</p>
<p>gestion, the Convention declared the existence of the Deity, and
</p>
<p>re-established the freedom of worship and opinion. The speeches
</p>
<p>and conduct of Robespierre on these occasions were of the sub-
</p>
<p>limest character. At the risk of his popularity, he opposed himself

</p>
<p>the Catholic worship, he defended its priests, because he saw the
</p>
<p>rights of conscience invaded in their persons. On the same prin

<p>ciple that he would have resisted the persecution of the Atheists
</p>
<p>by the priests, he now resisted that of the priests by the Atheists.
</p>
<p>One of his discourses on this topic is worth reciting here, if It
</p>
<p>were only to show his love of justice and the real magnanimity of his

</p>
<p>sociation with the less favoured ones, and from aiming to
</p>
<p>remain, by a violation of the law of equality, in possession

</p>
<p>is chiefly by the reciprocity of benefits, and by the
</p>
<p>knowledge of the advantages of social order, that the
</p>
<p>bond in question may be rendered indissoluble. When

<p>to this speech that a ci-devant bishop, then a deputy on mission,
</p>
<p>was heard to deliver himself at a popular tribunal of the following

<p>execrable words :

<p>* The Divinity, the grand phenomena of nature, the useful arts,

</p>
<p>After settling the foundations of the social economy
</p>
<p>suited to maintain equality, the Insurrectional Committee
</p>
<p>'applied itself to devise means by which the principle of
</p>
<p>the sovereignty of the people might be at all times
</p>
<p>secure from violation, that is to say, to dispose things in
</p>
<p>such a manner that no obligation could be imposed on
</p>
<p>the people without its bona fide consent, that it might
</p>
<p>have no difficulties or obstructions in emitting its will,
</p>
<p>and that it might carry into its deliberations all the ma
</p>
<p>turity desirable. In order to attain this end, it was
</p>
<p>necessary to determine the elements of which the people
</p>
<p>is composed, the forms to be observed in eliciting the
</p>
<p>expression of its will, and in ascertaining its decisions,
</p>
<p>and the precautions requisite to force the magistrates to
</p>
<p>submit to them.
</p>
<p>Before I render account of the projects of the Com
</p>
<p>mittee relative to the public authority  an account as
</p>
<p>faithful as the lapse of time, and the feeble and sole
</p>
<p>resource of my memory will permit  I ought to premise
</p>
<p>that they, one and all, tended to ensure the execution of
</p>
<p>the fundamental dogma  the people deliberates on the
</p>
<p>laws, consecrated by the Constitution of 1793, of which
</p>
<p>it forms the distinguishing character ; for the rest, I by
</p>
<p>\ no means give these projects as points definitely deter
</p>
<p>mined upon.
</p>
<p>The people, observed the Committee, is the totality
</p>
<p>of the individuals living as brothers under the same po
</p>
<p>litical laws, and as nature makes the happiness of indi
</p>
<p>viduals, and the durable tranquillity of society to depend
</p>
<p>on equality of rights, there cannot exist within the body
</p>
<p>of the nation a single individual having more or less than
</p>
<p>his proper share, without there being thereby sown a

<p>seed of disorder and dissolution. Consequently, all the

</p>
<p>adopted, not only as being in conformity with the prin
</p>
<p>ciple of community of goods, but also as a safeguard
</p>
<p>against the contagion of pernicious examples which might
</p>
<p>otherwise enervate the force of manners, and the love of
</p>
<p>equality, the only guarantees of the rights and happiness
</p>
<p>of all. Thus, between France and its neighbours, there
</p>
<p>would have been raised up, as it were, barriers bristled
</p>
<p>with obstacles  obstacles not insurmountable, however,
</p>
<p>for the love of humanity would have opened them to the
</p>
<p>persecuted friends of liberty, to the benefactors of nations
</p>
<p>attracted by the desire of knowing French institutions,
</p>
<p>and to all men weary of bondage, who might come with
</p>
<p>pure hearts to seek in our Repubhc the asylum of equality
</p>
<p>and happiness.*
</p>
<p>No pains would have been spared, however rigorous,
</p>
<p>to keep away all persons who would introduce frivolities
</p>
<p>and foreign fashions ; the curious would have been sub
</p>
<p>jected to rude tests (of their good faith), and to a severe
</p>
<p>surveillance ; and with respect to those honestly aspiring to
</p>
<p>the rights of citizenship, the law would have required that
</p>
<p>the National Act conferring them should be preceded by
</p>
<p>* This precaution in regard to foreigners was dictated not by a
</p>
<p>malevolent spirit of isolation, but by the desire of better dis
</p>
<p>charging the offices of humanity and fraternity, which all states
</p>
<p>reciprocally owe to one another. The first of these duties is that
</p>
<p>which binds a people to aid others in the recovery and defence of
</p>
<p>their natural rights ; and the Insurrectional Committee thought
</p>
<p>that the French Republic ought, above all others, to acquit itself
</p>
<p>of this duty, by displaying the brilliant example of a powerful
</p>
<p>institution founded upon equality and liberty. According to its
</p>
<p>view, so great a blqssing could not be communicated by force of
</p>
<p>arms, either because invasion carries with it the idea of conquest
</p>
<p>and domination, or because the accents of fraternity do not har
</p>
<p>monize well with the violences which follow in the train of war.

<p>Wishing, then, to render effectual the grand example that was
</p>
<p>preparing for the world, it was important to carefully ward oft
</p>
<p>from the new social order every thing that might retard or prevent
</p>
<p>its establishment; and consequently to rigidly exclude from the
</p>
<p>French territory that crew ot foreigners which hostile Govern

</p>
<p>of philanthropy, for the perfidious purpose of sowing discord and

<p>creating factions in it. , Besides, the experience of the Year II.
</p>
<p>was too recent not to make the necessity of caution be felt. A

<p>perfectly free intercourse would not have been held with foreign

<p>a long and scrupulous noviciate. Where there is a nume
</p>
<p>rous people spread over a vast territory, it is not possible
</p>
<p>to convene all the citizens to a single assembly, so as to
</p>
<p>collect the national will simultaneously at once. Hence
</p>
<p>the necessity of regulating in a uniform and commodious
</p>
<p>manner the sections into which the whole people is dis
</p>
<p>tributed, and to discover a prompt and easy means of
</p>
<p>comparing their wishes, without incurring the risk of
</p>
<p>seeing them misconstrued or outraged. The Committee
</p>
<p>believed that this end would be attained by means of the
</p>
<p>three following establishments:  1. The assembhes of
</p>
<p>Sovereignty. 2. The Central Assembly of Legislators.
</p>
<p>3. The body of Conservators of the National Wih.

<p>The two first are consecrated by the Constitution of

</p>
<p>tined to collect the Acts of the Sovereign wiu-
</p>
<p>Assemblies, and to proclaim the will of the Sovereign.
</p>
<p>It was, moreover, projected to constitute this body into
</p>
<p>a species of tribuneship, charged to see that the legislators
</p>
<p>might not, by abusing the right of passing decrees, make
</p>
<p>any encroachments on the legislative power. I do not

<p>tions, but I remember very well that it was agreed to

<p>engage the people to take them, by immediate suffrage,

<p>from the body of the senators.

<p>results of the popular deliberations were then transmitted

<p>to the Conservators, who proclaimed the will of the
</p>
<p>nation, by publishing the votes of each fraction of the

<p>of the Sovereignty might propose a new law, or the

<p>so often urged against Democracies, are no longer to be
</p>
<p>dreaded in a system where the deliberations pass through
</p>
<p>so many stages before being converted into laws. This
</p>
<p>manner of forming the law is, in these respects, prefer
</p>
<p>able to all others  that it has simplicity of manners and
</p>
<p>uniformity of interests for its supports, and that, by the
</p>
<p>already cited institution of senates, it offers the securest

<p>possible guarantee against human errors.

<p>intentions, but being composed of men, and man being
</p>
<p>fallible, it may be deceived. It is, therefore, prudent,
</p>
<p>and to its interest, to take precautions to guarantee itself

<p>from errors.
</p>
<p>Behold why, if it is contrary to the imprescriptible

<p>rights of people to dispossess them of the exercise of
</p>
<p>sovereign power, either by condemning them to silence,
</p>
<p>or by submitting to a particular sanction the acts of their

<p>lightened and useful decisions.

<p>example of ancient legislators, it found them in the ex

<p>perience and prudence of old age. It desired that an

</p>
<p>deliberate without having first heard the opinion of its

<p>Senate, whose functions were limited to advice, after
</p>
<p>which the senators should have voted with the citizens.

<p>Selected from the Senates, and it was proposed to also
</p>
<p>extract from them a Council of Ancients, charged with
</p>
<p>the sole function of enlightening by its advice the
</p>
<p>Central Assembly of Legislators.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was admitted, that FirBt formation
</p>
<p>time alone could give to this institution of senates.
</p>
<p>its utility and its efficacy. It was felt that the same
</p>
<p>force of habit which would one day attach old men to
</p>
<p>k2
</p>
<p>196 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>the institutions of equality, attached them then as now
</p>
<p>to the illusions of hereditary monarchy, to the errors of
</p>
<p>superstition, to the false fascinations of property, and to
</p>
<p>the precepts of a servile morality. The senates sought
</p>
<p>to be established were to be the conservators of equality
</p>
<p>and of democratic manners, and of these the majority of
</p>
<p>modern old men know neither the one nor the other.
</p>
<p>Besides, these bodies should have beeninthe commence
</p>
<p>ment the propagators of the new order, of which they
</p>
<p>would afterwards become the guardians. Accordingly,
</p>
<p>the Insurrectional Committee calculated on composing
</p>
<p>the first senates only of the citizens most distinguished
</p>
<p>for virtue, zeal, and attachment to the new institutions.
</p>
<p>After a certain time they would have united to them
</p>
<p>selves whatever old men were most estimable, and most
</p>
<p>agreeable to their respective arondissements.
</p>
<p>Inviolable prin- R appears from the preceding remarks
</p>
<p>ciples. that, in the eyes of the Committee, hap
</p>
<p>piness and liberty depend much more upon the main
</p>
<p>tenance of equality, and in the attachment of the citizens
</p>
<p>to the institutions which establish it, than on the dis
</p>
<p>tribution of the public administration. There was in
</p>
<p>their Republic an Institution of the State and a Con
</p>
<p>stitution of Authority, and in each are fundamental
</p>
<p>points which the people itself can neither violate nor
</p>
<p>modify, because they cannot be touched without in
</p>
<p>stantly dissolving society. Such are, in the first,
</p>
<p>rigorous equality ; and in the second, the popular
</p>
<p>sovereignty . The inviolability of these dogmas would
</p>
<p>have been solemnly recognized by the law which was to
</p>
<p>authorise resistance and insurrection in case a part of the

<p>citizens should attempt, in misconception of these dogmas,
</p>
<p>to arrogate to itself the right of enslaving the rest.

<p>people, as directed by the laws. There is, then, in the

<p>Republic, a graduated scale of magistracies, descending
</p>
<p>by divers degrees of jurisdiction from the Executive
</p>
<p>Council to the inferior officers, who form the point of
</p>
<p>contact between the sovereign power and each of its
</p>
<p>subject parts. A similar scale, but altogether judicial,
</p>
<p>re-ascends from the inferior magistrates appointed to

<p>verify and prosecute infractions of the laws, up to the

<p>supreme tribunal, whose province is to maintain uniformity

<p>of legislation throughout the whole. One class of magis

<p>trates direct productive occupations, and regulate the

</p>
<p>others maintain harmony among the citizens. Some watch j

<p>over the defence of the state, and implant in the soul the

<p>seeds of courage and virtue ; others let fall the severity of i

<p>are protected, and the deluded set right ; by others are

<p>aliments incessantly supplied to feed the love of country,
</p>
<p>by liberty, by majesty, and by the propriety and gaiety
</p>
<p>which they cause to reign in the public meetings and

<p>festivals. It would be as tedious as it is unnecessary to enter
</p>
<p>into all the details of this social order, the bases of which
</p>
<p>are laid by the Constitution of 1793 ; it institutes on the

<p>flow as so many consequences from the foregoing princi-

<p>ciples, I will confine myself here to the explanation of the
</p>
<p>means by which it was hoped that so great a number of
</p>
<p>magistrates would be restrained within legal bounds. In
</p>
<p>fact, no nation had ever so many magistrates, without

</p>
<p>taking into account that, in certain respects, every citizen
</p>
<p>would have been a magistrate, keeping watch for him
</p>
<p>self and others ; it is certain that public functions would
</p>
<p>be very much multiplied, and, consequently, the magis
</p>
<p>trates very numerous. The aggregate, or totality of
</p>
<p>functions, being composed of every action necessary for
</p>
<p>feeding, clothing, lodging, educating, informing, govern
</p>
<p>ing, and defending the people, every citizen, so to speak,
</p>
<p>is, or has been, a functionary. The difference between
</p>
<p>the functions, in which all participate, and those assigned
</p>
<p>by the laws to particular magistrates, consists in this 
</p>
<p>that the latter have exclusively for their object to direct
</p>
<p>and protect the rest. We call them public functions.

<p>its regards to such laws by which nobody could be raised

<p>and without having successively passed through all the

</p>
<p>inferior magistracies of the same class. This provision,
</p>
<p>which the Committee by no means extended to the
</p>
<p>exercise of sovereign power (in which the people should
</p>
<p>be left unlimited liberty), appeared to it to unite to the
</p>
<p>advantage of calling to the more important functions
</p>
<p>only men of matured experience, that of better pre

<p>serving the spirit of reform, which, for the rest, could
</p>
<p>only attain complete success by the abandonment of
</p>
<p>vanity, pride, and avarice, and by a happy change in
</p>
<p>the morality and manners of the citizens.

</p>
<p>humanity, and of their country, whose reason and
</p>
<p>courage have shot in advance of the reason and courage
</p>
<p>of their contemporaries. The spirit^ of_ the Republic,
</p>
<p>when established, forms that ofuie citizens and of the
</p>
<p>magistrates; but at the commencement it is only the
</p>
<p>wisest and most ardent instigators of reform who can
</p>
<p>create the popular Republican spirit. It was, therefore,
</p>
<p>a point resolutely agreed on by the Committee, that the

<p>magistracies, composed at first, and exclusively of the

<p>best Revolutionists, should not be subsequently renewed

<p>by the full application of the constitutional laws at once,

<p>but only gradually and partially in proportion to the

<p>progress of national regeneration.

<p>principles of liberty and equality sacred. The grand

<p>should here, therefore, consider education in two points

</p>
<p>of the Republic when founded, afterwards as a means of

</p>
<p>ought to have in view is the same for both, but the

<p>differences made by nature between the sexes apprise us
</p>
<p>that we cannot, without running counter to her laws,
</p>
<p>employ indiscriminately the same processes of training for

<p>servation of individuals, that the development of the
</p>
<p>passion of love, which is accelerated by early intercourse
</p>
<p>of the sexes, should be retarded. It is, therefore, expedient

<p>that they should be brought up separately. According

<p>the work of reform, to maintain and consolidate the
</p>
<p>Republic, the latter is the sole competent judge of the
</p>
<p>instructions and habits which ought to be given to youth.
</p>
<p>Besides, the principal object of education ought to be
</p>
<p>to engrave profoundly on all hearts the sentiments of

<p>regime of families is directly and abhorrently opposed.

<p>be altogether the same. Let us speak first of that of

<p>was to have three objects in view :  1 . The strength

<p>the heart; 3. The development of the understanding.

<p>are conditions on which essentially depend

<p>the happiness and safety of the Republic. These are

<p>acquired and preserved by the action of the organs, and

<p>by banishing the causes which disturb the animal func

</p>
<p>to be habituated to the most difficult movements, and to
</p>
<p>live in the strictest frugality. Military manoeuvres,
</p>
<p>coursing, riding, wrestling, pugilism, dancing, hunting,
</p>
<p>and swimming, were the games and recreations which
</p>
<p>the Insurrectional Committee intended for the rising

<p>banished from the national houses of education, and that

<p>embellish the public festivals all should be skilled in

</p>
<p>education destined by the Committee for the youth of
</p>
<p>France ; to that Committee it was an object of predilec
</p>
<p>tion, because they considered it the most solid foundation
</p>
<p>of social equality, and of the Republic.
</p>
<p>Thus inured to fatigue, exercised in agriculture and the
</p>
<p>useful arts, provided with useful knowledge, the young
</p>
<p>people would have insensibly become the hope and con
</p>
<p>solation of all the citizens, who would have found in them
</p>
<p>a great source of comfort during their hours of labour,
</p>
<p>and of agreeable and inspiring delight in the public

<p>festivals. No more domestic education  no more paternal sway,
</p>
<p>but, for the individual authority thus taken from fathers
</p>
<p>at home, the law would have compensated them with
</p>
<p>authority a hundred fold greater in common. The se
</p>
<p>nates, of which mention has been made, were to become

<p>in each arrondissement, the guardians of the houses of

<p>education, and under their direction, the women also

<p>the too early impulses of sexual passion.
</p>
<p>The girls, they continued, will be brought up to the

</p>
<p>object with them to be loved by the men, and they will,

<p>consequently, participate in the studies calculated to
</p>
<p>make them admire the wisdom of its laws ; they will be

<p>sence, in the sports of the boys, in order that gaiety and

<p>innocence may preside over the first emotions of love,
</p>
<p>and be the happv forerunners of approaching unions.
</p>
<p>It is impossible for me to enter into all the details of
</p>
<p>so new an institution, of which the Committee had
</p>
<p>scarcely sketched the plan. For the rest, it suffices to
</p>
<p>know that the grand end of the education, national,
</p>
<p>common, and equal, was to form vigorous citizens, who
</p>
<p>would have served the Republic with devotion, from the
</p>
<p>habit of behaving well, and for the pleasure of contribut
</p>
<p>ing to the prosperity of so fond a country.
</p>
<p>In the system of the Committee, the Military eduea-
</p>
<p>young people passed from the houses of tlon-
</p>
<p>education to the camps established near the frontiers ;
</p>
<p>there, always ready to repel external aggressions, they
</p>
<p>would be perfected in the military art ; there, living in
</p>
<p>a perfect community of work and enjoyments, they
</p>
<p>would have acquired, by fatigue, by application, and by
</p>
<p>frugality, the requisite qualities for obtaining, on their
</p>
<p>return home, the exercise of the rights of citizenship.
</p>
<p>On the success of the first essays of this kind depended,
</p>
<p>as the conspirators thought, that of their projected refor
</p>
<p>mation. That alone, said they, will suffice to establish
</p>
<p>equality ; for that alone will prove the existence of man
</p>
<p>ners, and of Republican opinions, which the existing
</p>
<p>generation can adopt but very imperfectly.

<p>In order the better to preserve the spirit Assemblies of

<p>of the new laws, and the principles of instruction.

<p>public morality, assemblies of instruction werejo have
</p>
<p>been opened, where it would have been lawful for each

<p>citizen to explain to the public the precepts of Repub

</p>
<p>affairs. Near these assemblies the magistrates would
</p>
<p>have established printing-offices and libraries.
</p>
<p>In this order of things, printing is the Liberty of the
</p>
<p>most active means of communication, and press.
</p>
<p>the best rampart against any usurpation of the sovereignty
</p>
<p>( of the people. It alone can render the citizens of a
</p>
<p>1 vast state equally competent to pronounce ripely on the
</p>
<p>projects of law submitted to them ; it alone gradually
</p>
<p>ameliorates public order ; it alone baffles the machina
</p>
<p>tions of ambitious men. But individual property being
</p>
<p>abolished, and all pecuniary interest become impossible,
</p>
<p>it is necessary to adopt means for deriving from the
</p>
<p>press all the services to be expected, without risking the
</p>
<p>again calling in question the justice of equality, and the
</p>
<p>rights of the people, or delivering the Repubhc to inter
</p>
<p>minable and disastrous discussions. On the subject of
</p>
<p>the liberty of the press, the following articles had been
</p>
<p>submitted to the examination of the Insurrectional Com
</p>
<p>mittee : 
</p>
<p>1 . No one may promulgate opinions directly contrary
</p>
<p>to the sacred principles of equality, and of the sovereignty
</p>
<p>of the people.
</p>
<p>2. All writings on the form of Government, and on
</p>
<p>its administration, are to be printed, and sent to all the
</p>
<p>libraries upon the demand of an assembly of sovereignty,
</p>
<p>or of a prescribed number of citizens, above the age of
</p>
<p>thirty. 3. No writing about any pretended revelation what
</p>
<p>ever can be published.
</p>
<p>4. All writings are printed and distributed, if the
</p>
<p>conservators of the National Will shall judge that their
</p>
<p>publication may be useful to the Republic.
</p>
<p>In speaking of education, we have seen that the in

<p>ideas of happiness, dangerous examples, and incentives
</p>
<p>to pride and vanity. This article was, like a great many
</p>
<p>others, discussed again and again, and the discussion

<p>was not exhausted when the Committee was forced to

<p>renounce its enterprize.

</p>
<p>By the progress of the arts, it was Advantages of
</p>
<p>sometimes argued, indispensable labours the arts and
</p>
<p>may be mitigated, communications by sciences-
</p>
<p>land and by water may become easier and more rapid,
</p>
<p>and new enjoyments may be added to the mass of the
</p>
<p>common enjoyments. And what would the arts be, con
</p>
<p>tinued the speaker, without the sciences which fix the
</p>
<p>theories of them, and illustrate the practice? By the
</p>
<p>sciences, diseases are often cured or prevented. They
</p>
<p>teach man to know himself; they preserve him from
</p>
<p>religious fanaticism, put him on his guard against des
</p>
<p>potism, charm his leisure hours, and elevate his soul to
</p>
<p>the highest virtues.
</p>
<p>But considering things under other as- Evils which
</p>
<p>pects, there were seen to spring from the flow from them.
</p>
<p>refinement of the arts, a taste for superfluities, disgust
</p>
<p>at simple manners, the love of voluptuousness and fri
</p>
<p>volities. It was feared that men, devoting themselves to
</p>
<p>the sciences, would imperceptibly form for themselves
</p>
<p>out of their acquirements, real or supposed claims to
</p>
<p>distinctions, to superiority, and to exemption from the
</p>
<p>common burdens; and that the opinion entertained of their
</p>
<p>knowledge would, by feeding their vanity, engage them
</p>
<p>at last in disastrous enterprises, against the rights of simple
</p>
<p>and less informed persons, whose honesty they would
</p>
<p>deceive by the aid of an hypocritical and dangerous
</p>
<p>eloquence. To the weight of these reflections was joined
</p>
<p>that of the opinion of Jean Jacques Rousseau, who had
</p>
<p>said, on the authority of history, that never were morality
</p>
<p>and liberty found united with a brilliant state of the arts
</p>
<p>and sciences. During the discussions which frequently
</p>
<p>took place on this subject, it was observed that the
</p>
<p>greater part of the evils for which the arts and sciences
</p>
<p>were blamed, being caused by the thirst for gain, which
</p>
<p>now tempts people to make professions of them, it was

<p>probable they would disappear, and that the number of
</p>
<p>artists and professors would greatly diminish, once the
</p>
<p>establishment of community had annihilated poverty,
</p>
<p>and destroyed the possibility of subserving avarice. With
</p>
<p>respect to the following points which had been proposed,
</p>
<p>the Committee came to no determination : 
</p>
<p>212 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>1 . No study or profession gives a right to exemption
</p>
<p>from the common labours of society.
</p>
<p>2. There shall be regularly appointed magistrates to
</p>
<p>preserve and to increase the existing stock of human
</p>
<p>knowledge. 3. Such young persons as may have given proof of
</p>
<p>great natural talents shall, upon quitting the houses
</p>
<p>of education, be sent to those magistrates to pursue their
</p>
<p>studies under their direction.
</p>
<p>Such are the faint outlines of the civil
</p>
<p>i ' and political order towards which the efforts
</p>
<p>of the Insurrectional Committee were directed. The
</p>
<p>objections against it rest partly on the alleged injustice
</p>
<p>of its projects, and partly on the presumed impossibility
</p>
<p>of putting them in execution. As to the injustice, we
</p>
<p>have, in the course of this work, placed our readers in a
</p>
<p>situation to form their own judgment upon it. As regards
</p>
<p>the impossibility of execution  the vulgar objection of
</p>
<p>all whom the slightest reform alarms  we will only ob
</p>
<p>serve, that when a just idea has been formed of the state
</p>
<p>of France during the two first years of the Republic,
</p>
<p>every thinking person must be convinced that the devo
</p>
<p>tion of the French people to the cause of equality, and
</p>
<p>their confidence in its leaders, were then so great that
</p>
<p>there was no democratic institution whatever which they
</p>
<p>would not have adopted with enthusiasm. Those happy
</p>
<p>dispositions were, it is true, greatly weakened by the
</p>
<p>frightful event of the 9th Thermidor;* but they still
</p>
<p>continued to manifest themselves strongly, during the
</p>
<p>labours of the Insurrectional Committee, and even a
</p>
<p>long time after. Besides being natural to the people,
</p>
<p>they are always ready to show themselves whenever the
</p>
<p>causes cease which keep them down, and in fear of de
</p>
<p>claring themselves. Obstacles to real Radical reform
</p>
<p>never come from the majority of citizens ; they always

<p>* The results of that day were the more disastrous, inasmuch

<p>share of the general labour. Reduce this corrupt minority
</p>
<p>to silence, and all the rest of society will applaud you,
</p>
<p>and second you with all their force. For the rest, the
</p>
<p>Committee, I repeat, far from pretending to give us
</p>
<p>complete equality at once the day after the insurrection,
</p>
<p>(though resolved to neglect no means of accelerating its
</p>
<p>establishment), did not consider itself to be in a condition
</p>
<p>to determine the epoch of its commencement. It felt the
</p>
<p>necessity of proceeding gradually, according to the pro
</p>
<p>gress of opinion, and the success of its first measures of
</p>
<p>which I am about to render account. Indeed, had it
</p>
<p>only founded upon a solid basis its proposed system of
</p>
<p>education in common, it would have done a vast deal for
</p>
<p>humanity.* * What the Democrats of the Year IV. were unable to execute
</p>
<p>in France, a generous man has recently essayed, by other means,
</p>
<p>to put in practice in the British Isles and in America. Robert
</p>
<p>Owen, the Scotchman, after having established in his own
</p>
<p>country, and at his own expense, some communities founded on_
</p>
<p>the principles of equal distribution of enjoyments and of labours, has
</p>
<p>just formed in the Lnited States sundry similar establishments,
</p>
<p>in which several thousands of people live peaceably under the
</p>
<p>happy regime of perfect equality.
</p>
<p>By the counsels of this friend of humanity, the co-operative
</p>
<p>society established in London has been for some time at work, pro
</p>
<p>pagating the principles of community, and demonstrating, by
</p>
<p>practical examples, the possibility of their application.
</p>
<p>Babeuf attempted to combine a numerous people into one single
</p>
<p>and grand community ; Owen, placed in other circumstances,
</p>
<p>would multiply in a country small communities, which afterwards
</p>
<p>united by a general bond, might become, as it were, so many
</p>
<p>individuals of one gTeat family. Babeuf wished his friends to
</p>
<p>seize on the supreme authority, as by its influence he hoped to
</p>
<p>effectuate the reforms they had projected; Owen calculates on
</p>
<p>success by preaching and by example. May he show to the^l
</p>
<p>world that wisdom can operate so vast a good without the aid of '

</p>
<p>noble efforts fail, and furnishing, by an unsuccessful experience,
</p>
<p>the advocates of equality with an argument against the possibility
</p>
<p>of establishing, in any manner, a social equality, to which violent
</p>
<p>passions oppose so formidable a resistance, and which, as ap

<p>peared in our time, could only be the result of a strong political
</p>
<p>commotion amongst civilized nations.

<p>For my own part, while I admire both Babeuf and Robert Owen

<p>and agree, generally, with both as to the end sought, I am obliged

<p>to dissent from both as regards means. The points in which 1
</p>
<p>agree and differ from them will be found in the following article
</p>
<p>of mine, which appeared some weeks ago in the Twopenny Dis
</p>
<p>patch : 
</p>
<p>" It has been intimated to me, that in consequence of my having
</p>
<p>expressed generally a concurrence in the political and social prin
</p>
<p>ciples of Buonarroti, as promulgated in this work, an impression
</p>
<p>has gone abroad that I am for a community of goods and labour, to
</p>
<p>be established by force, if necessary. It has also been insinuated,
</p>
<p>that my design in sending forth the work, is to instruct the British
</p>
<p>people in the arts of conspiracy and insurrection. I ought not,
</p>
<p>perhaps, to notice such silly imputations, but, as it is not my habit
</p>
<p>to disguise or qualify my principles, let me, once for all, explain
</p>
<p>what they really are, to prevent further misconception.
</p>
<p>" I am for liberty and equality ; meaning by these terms pre
</p>
<p>cisely what they are defined to be by Mr. Augustus Beaumont, in
</p>
<p>his excellent prospectus to the Radical newspaper, namely  " An
</p>
<p>equal opportunity to every man of obtaining all the advantages of so
</p>
<p>ciety ; no one having a monopoly, and each exclusively enjoying the
</p>
<p>produce of his own industry and intellect !" The first step towards
</p>
<p>this equality, is the extension of the franchise to all classes alike,
</p>
<p>without restriction or qualification, other than what would apply
</p>
<p>equally to all members of the social body, such as age, sanity, and
</p>
<p>moral fitness, &c. Therefore, the first article in my creed is

<p>Universal Suffrage, alias, the equal participation of all in forming
</p>
<p>the laws and institutions of the country. As to the ballot, short
</p>
<p>parliaments, equal representation, and so forth, they are mere ac
</p>
<p>cidents or contrivances for securing the valid use of the franchise.
</p>
<p>They are not rights, hut arrangements for the due exercise of
</p>
<p>rights, and being the best at present familiar to us, I am for having
</p>
<p>them, at least till better ones he discovered and agreed upon. Some
</p>
<p>such guarantees for good voting will be always necessary, so long
</p>
<p>as the laws are not directly made or approved by the people themselves,
</p>
<p>as was the case with the Athenians and Romans, and as was pro
</p>
<p>vided in France by the famous Constitution of 1793. By that

</p>
<p>devoted to the principles of the new Revolution, and not
</p>
<p>to leave the well-known enemies of equality any time foi
</p>
<p>concerting the plots to which, it was certain, they would
</p>
<p>resort. Constitution the representative body could only propose bills and
</p>
<p>discuss them, after which they should be transmitted to the Pri
</p>
<p>mary Assemblies to be approved by the people : otherwise they
</p>
<p>were not law. The authors of that Constitution were too well
</p>
<p>acquainted with the encroaching spirit of representative bodies to
</p>
<p>trust them with the whole legislative power. To the people alone
</p>
<p>was that most important of all functions reserved. Hence, they
</p>
<p>had little need of ballot-boxes, or short parliaments, though, in
</p>
<p>deed, to make assurance doubly sure, they made annual elections
</p>
<p>one of the articles of the Constitution. If it rested with me, no
</p>
<p>Parliament  no matter how elected  should have the power of
</p>
<p>passing laws. I would provide, as the Democrats of France did,
</p>
<p>that that power should reside in, and be inalienable from the people.
</p>
<p>Parliaments are good and necessary to originate and discuss laws
</p>
<p> to collect the evideuces necessary to adjust the details of them,
</p>
<p>and, finally, to put them into shape and form ; but as to passing-
</p>
<p>them, that is quite another question. The moment a people lets
</p>
<p>that power out of its hands, farewell its rights and liberties. Even
</p>
<p>with universal suffrage it is almost impossible to recover them.
</p>
<p>The temptations to abuse are too great for any Parliament to with
</p>
<p>stand. Hence there has hardly ever existed a representative
</p>
<p>body that has not, at some time or another, prostituted its mission
</p>
<p>to sinister ends. Even in Republican America the representative
</p>
<p>chambers are little better than gangs of smooth-tongued lawyers
</p>
<p>and profit-mongers, who make all the institutions to favour their
</p>
<p>own class. Witness the recent chartering of the United States'
</p>
<p>Bank by the legislature of Pennsylvania. Would that have hap
</p>
<p>pened, if the law were referred to the people for approval : I
</p>
<p>apprehend not. At all events, if I had my way, the people's sanc
</p>
<p>tion should be essential to every law ; and if I have not hitherto
</p>
<p>broached the doctrine, it is only because I would not distract the
</p>
<p>people's attention by new projects, especially as I deem universal

<p>suffrage sufficient to gradually give us all we want. The best
</p>
<p>fundamental law ever promulgated to man was the French Demo
</p>
<p>cratic Constitution of 1793, which was voted by nearly five millions
</p>
<p>of adult Frenchmen. Had that Constitution survived, how dif
</p>
<p>ferent would be the condition of France now ! It is my firm con
</p>
<p>viction, that had Robespierre and his friends lived to execute it,
</p>
<p>there would not be now one pauper or one oppressor on the French
</p>
<p>territory, nor probably in Europe. To this end was it drawn up
</p>
<p>by its framers, and it was solely owing to its pre-eminent fitness
</p>
<p>to attain such end, that the brigands of the Convention conspired
</p>
<p>216 babeuf s conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Proclamation^ For this purpose, the Committee had
</p>
<p>the French resolved the plan of a proclamation to the
</p>
<p>people. French people, of which one of its mem
</p>
<p>bers was in the act of writing the first sentences, when
</p>
<p>to Burke it after the death of Robespien-e. It was a fatal error of
</p>
<p>the Revolutionists of 1330 not to have proclaimed it at Paris
</p>
<p>during the three glorious days. Should there be ever another
</p>
<p>successful popular commotion in France, the insurrectionists
</p>
<p>ought to proclaim it instantly, and see that it was speedily exe
</p>
<p>cuted. How grievously do we Radicals feel the want of some such
</p>
<p>rallying point in England.
</p>
<p>" Buonarroti was a great admirer of the Constitution of 1793  so
</p>
<p>am I ; but Buonarroti thought it did not go far enough, because it
</p>
<p>did not proscribe individual commerce and private property.
</p>
<p>There I differ from Buonarroti. If all men are placed equal before
</p>
<p>the law  if the means of acquiring and retaining wealth are equally
</p>
<p>secured to all in proportion to the respective industry and services
</p>
<p>of each, I see no obj ection to private property. Every man has a
</p>
<p>right to the value of his own produce or services, be they more or
</p>
<p>less. If one man can and will do twice the work of another man,
</p>
<p>he ought certainly in justice to have twice the reward. But ifhis
</p>
<p>superior strength or skill gives him the means of acquiring more
</p>
<p>wealth than his neighbour, it by no means follows that he ought,
</p>
<p>therefore, to acquire a right or power over his neighbour's pro
</p>
<p>duce as well as his own. And here lies the grand evil of
</p>
<p>society  it is not in private property, but in the unjust and
</p>
<p>atrocious powers with which the existing laws of all countries
</p>
<p>invest it. If a man has fairly earned a hundred or a thousand
</p>
<p>pounds' worth of wealth beyond what he has consumed or
</p>
<p>spent, he has a sacred right to the exclusive use of it, if he
</p>
<p>thinks proper ; but he has no right to use that wealth in such a
</p>
<p>way as to make it a sort of sucking-pump or thumbscrew for suck
</p>
<p>ing and screwing other people's produce into his possession. Sir
</p>
<p>John Cam Hobhouse, for example, has 60,000/. in Whitbread's
</p>
<p>brewery. Now, supposing Sir John to have earned that money

<p>honestly, he has a right to use it, and live upon it, while it lasts ;
</p>
<p>but he has no just right to make it the means of sucking 5,000/. or
</p>
<p>6,000(. additional every year out of the public, without a particle
</p>
<p>of labour or industry on his part. He has no just right to employ
</p>
<p>his money in usury or speculation. His money should not be al
</p>
<p>lowed to grow money, as cabbage grows cabbage, or weeds grow
</p>
<p>weeds. To employ money in that way is not to use the right of
</p>
<p>property, but to practise robbery. Every shilling which Sir John
</p>
<p>Cam now derives from Whitbread's brewery is a shilling not
</p>
<p>earned, but a shilling filched from the public. Sir John does nothing
</p>
<p>for it, and the people get no return, or equivalent. I do not im-

</p>
<p>he was seized by the satellites of tyranny* By this
</p>
<p>proclamation was to be placed before the people's eyes,
</p>
<p>the long tissue of crimes, by means of which equality and
</p>
<p>the rights of the citizens had been indignantly outraged ;
</p>
<p>pute this as a crime to Sir John. The fault is not in him, but in
</p>
<p>the laws and institutions of the country, which have established
</p>
<p>such modes of acquiring wealth. Sir John does no more than
</p>
<p>what is uniformly practised in trade. He takes advantage of his
</p>
<p>" capital," and of the poverty that surrounds him. He says to the
</p>
<p>hungry man, come and labour for me, create fresh wealth for me,
</p>
<p>and you shall have a small share of your produce to keep you
</p>
<p>alive. You ought to have the whole, I know. There ought to be
</p>
<p>institutions which would enable you to get and retain the whole,
</p>
<p>but as no such institutions exist now, you must either starve or
</p>
<p>submit to my terms. " Hunger makes every thing sweet but
</p>
<p>itself." The labourer canjtand any thing before hunger. Hence
</p>
<p>Sir John grows richer and richer every day, without earning any
</p>
<p>riches at all, while he who produces the riches grows poorer and
</p>
<p>poorer, as age diminishes his strength, till at last he dies in poverty
</p>
<p>and in the workhouse. Such are the effects of wealth as now
</p>
<p>administered. They result not from property, but from robbery
</p>
<p> they are not rights of property, but wrongs on industry  they
</p>
<p>spring from bad laws  from depraved institutions. These laws
</p>
<p>and these institutions, instead of protecting industry from dishonest
</p>
<p>cupidity, have utterly sacrificed the former to the latter. The
</p>
<p>employers of labour and the exchangers of wealth are alone con
</p>
<p>sidered in the laws. The producers and active distributors are
</p>
<p>only thought of as slaves or criminals. Enormous fleets and armies
</p>
<p>are kept up to protect the merchants' gains. Enormous gaols and
</p>
<p>penitentiaries are kept up for tbe poor. Thus are the labourers
</p>
<p>forced to pay, not only for the protection of those that plunder
</p>
<p>them, but for the very instruments of their own torture and misery.
</p>
<p>Buonarroti considers all these results inseparable from private

<p>crats of 1793  so do Robert Owen and his disciples of the present
</p>
<p>day. I think differently. I will never admit that private property
</p>
<p>is incompatible with public happiness, till I see it fairly tried. I
</p>
<p>never found an objection urged against it, which I cannot trace to
</p>
<p>the abuse, not the use, of the institution. Assuredly, if men are
</p>
<p>allowed to acquire wealth by all manner of nefarious means, and
</p>
<p>to afterwards employ that wealth more nefariously still, there must
</p>
<p>be public ruin and misery ; but I deny that these are the necessary

</p>
<p>the proclamation was then to show that the causes of
</p>
<p>the public calamities  the same which had occasioned
</p>
<p>the Revolution, and which the Revolution had not yet
</p>
<p>uprooted  were all to be traced to social inequality, and
</p>
<p>effects of private property. Usury, for instance, has destroyed all
</p>
<p>the nations of antiquity, and is now undermining all modern states ;
</p>
<p>but is usury essential to private property 1 I deny it. But, then
</p>
<p>it is necessary to, and inseparable from, commerce. I deny that
</p>
<p>too. It is, certainly, inseparable from commerce as now con
</p>
<p>ducted ; but I deny that an enlightened Government, representing
</p>
<p>all classes, would allow commerce to be conducted as it is now.
</p>
<p>I assert, that such Government would place commerce and manu
</p>
<p>factures upon a totally different footing from the present, and make
</p>
<p>the land the common property of all the inhabitants, and that, with
</p>
<p>out any real or material injury to the existing proprietors. I hold,
</p>
<p>and I am sure I can prove, that such a dispensation of things is
</p>
<p>within the power of an enlightened Legislature, fairly representing
</p>
<p>all classes. I have no space to argue the question here ; but,
</p>
<p>assuming that I am right for the present, why should we conclude
</p>
<p>that private property is the inevitable cause of the evils alluded to,
</p>
<p>until the institution be fairly tried and tested 1
</p>
<p>" But, if I hold these opinions on private property, let it not be
</p>
<p>supposed that I am opposed to the system of community. On the
</p>
<p>contrary, I hold that system to be the ultimatum of social pro
</p>
<p>gression. I hold it to be the grand prize destined by our Creator
</p>
<p>lov trie human race, whenever it shall prove itself worthy of it by
</p>
<p>the perfection of moral and intellectual science. Were it possible
</p>
<p>to induce all men to ronounce individual and selfish interests, and
</p>
<p>to combine their powers for the common advantage, I am enthu
</p>
<p>siast enough to believe that the human race might be as far raised
</p>
<p>above its present state as it is now above the meanest animals
</p>
<p>that it would, in fact, attain a degree of prosperity and happines
</p>
<p>of which not one mind in ten thousand is now capable of forming
</p>
<p>an estimate. But the elements of such community do not at pre

<p>with the existing laws and institutions of property. To obtain the
</p>
<p>prevalence of suchopinions and habits, we must first have property
</p>
<p>upon a just and legitimate foundation. Whenever that is done, we
</p>
<p>shall witness the spontaneous formation of communities, without
</p>
<p>the necessity of either law or force to establish them. The dif
</p>
<p>ference between Buonarroti's ideas and mine, then, is this :
</p>
<p>Buonarroti would establish community by force ; I would leave it
</p>
<p>to establish itself spontaneously, by first preparing the materials
</p>
<p>through a radical reform of the laws of property. It is the right of
</p>
<p>every man to have the produce of his labour secured to him by
</p>
<p>law it is not bis right to compel any other man to co-operate with
</p>
<p>BABEUF S CONSPIRACY. 219
</p>
<p>its resulting vices ; to propose to the nation the conduct
</p>
<p>of the people of Paris as the model to be universally
</p>
<p>imitated, to boldly invite the French nation to equality,
</p>
<p>and to enter into a solemn engagement to ensure it to
</p>
<p>him in forming communities. The latter is the spontaneous work
</p>
<p>of wisdom. Laws can have nothing to do with it, further than to
</p>
<p>prepare the materials, and encourage it by sympathy and protection.
</p>
<p>I have no doubt that had the Constitution of 1793 been established
</p>
<p>in France, it would have led to the magnificent results anticipated
</p>
<p>by its benevolent framers. That Constitution was wise and just
</p>
<p>in not making community of property an elementary principle.
</p>
<p>The National Convention had no right to say to Frenchmen you
</p>
<p>must all club your means and resources, you must live in commu
</p>
<p>nity, and work and enjoy on equal terms. That would be to sub
</p>
<p>ject the whole to the opinions of a sect; and hence do I differ
</p>
<p>from Babeuf and Buonarroti, in preferring Robespierre's Declara
</p>
<p>tion in favour of private property to their proscription of the insti
</p>
<p>tution. If people choose to renounce private property, and live in
</p>
<p>community, they have a right to do so ; but they have no right to
</p>
<p>compel others to the same course. The system of community
</p>
<p>must, as I observed before, be the spontaneous growth of wisdom.
</p>
<p>The Constitution of 1793 neither ordained it nor proscribed it. It
</p>
<p>contented itself with laying the foundations of a just and natural
</p>
<p>order of things, leaving it to time and wisdom to develope the ad
</p>
<p>vantages of community. I know not whether my readers have
</p>
<p>seen the work of Mr. Etzler, lately published in America, and re
</p>
<p>published in London by Mr. Brooks, of Oxford-street. If people
</p>
<p>would know the advantages of community let them read that book.
</p>
<p>It is entitled, " Paradise within the Reach of all Men," and though
</p>
<p>some of its statements appear extravagant, it is impossible to deny
</p>
<p>the truth of its general principles, or of the particular facts and
</p>
<p>experiments detailed in it. Why do I mention this book 1 Be
</p>
<p>cause, believing that the system of community must be the work
</p>
<p>of wisdom and knowledge, not of force or law, I believe EtzlerE
</p>

</p>
<p>BUONARROTI'S DEFENCE OF OWEN AND BABEUF.
</p>
<p>Several objections have been urged against the system of Owen,
</p>
<p>which apply equally to that of Babeuf. Let us record them, and
</p>
<p>tne answers which demonstrate their futility.
</p>
<p>1st Objection.  The physical differences which exist amongst
</p>
<p>men do not permit, in the distribution of labour and of the
</p>
<p>objects of consumption, that perfect equality which is the end of
</p>
<p>community. Answer.  In this case, equality ought to be measured by the
</p>
<p>capacity of the workman, and by the want of the consumer, and
</p>
<p>not by the intensity of the work and quantity of the objects con
</p>
<p>sumed. The man who possessing one degree of strength raises a
</p>
<p>weight of ten pounds, works equally hard as he who, having a
</p>
<p>quintuple strength, raises a weight of fifty pounds. Again, the
</p>
<p>man who, to appease a burning thirst, drinks a bottle of water,
</p>
<p>does not enjoy more than his fellow man who, with a less ardent
</p>
<p>-thirst, swallows only a small pintful. The end of the community
</p>
<p>[ in question is equality of enjoyments and of labour, and not that
</p>
<p>of the things to be consumed, or of the task of the labourer.
</p>
<p>2nd Objection.  The unequal quantity of objects of the same
</p>
<p>kind, as fruits, vegetables, dairy produce, viands, drink, liquors,
</p>
<p>&c. &c, would introduce into distribution a real inequality,

</p>
<p>which would engender jealousy and altercations, and would con
</p>
<p>vert society into an abode of discord and endless enmities.
</p>
<p>Answer.  People reason thus, only because they judge of men
</p>
<p>brought up under a system of perfect fraternity after themselves,
</p>
<p>whom bad institutions render vain, jealous, and enemies of one
</p>
<p>another. It is unjust towards the Author of nature to suppose
</p>
<p>that men are naturally prone to envy, hate, and tear one another
</p>
<p>for the sake of a fruit, or for the sweet scent of a flower  while
</p>
<p>fruits and flowers abound around them. Remove individual pro
</p>
<p>perty from men, and you will calm their most fatal passions, and
</p>
<p>at the same time rid them of almost nil means of self-in
</p>
<p>jury. Besides, could not the petty inequalities in question be
</p>
<p>rendered still less sensible by casting lots, or by distributing the
</p>
<p>bad and good alternately to each? In morals, in politics, and
</p>
<p>in economy, equality is not mathematical identity: it is not
</p>
<p>altered by petty differences. Good sense and the spirit of

</p>
<p>in insurrection, and would have consecrated the Consti
</p>
<p>tution of 1793 as the ultimate term of the new political
</p>
<p>regime ; without prejudice, however, to certain supple
</p>
<p>ments to be added, and the previous establishment of
</p>
<p>equality and concord, smoothed away in Sparta all those feeble
</p>
<p>difficulties, which, even now, do not trouble the peace of nu
</p>
<p>merous families, of boarding-houses, and of military barracks.
</p>
<p>3rd Objection.  If society charged itself with providing for the
</p>
<p>wants ot each and all, nobody would feel the necessity of working
</p>
<p>to procure his subsistence, and a man naturally inclined to idle
</p>
<p>ness would abandon himself to a general indifference, which
</p>
<p>would render all labour impossible,
</p>
<p>Answer.  Every well-constituted man has need of motion, and
</p>
<p>to dissipate ennui he seeks work, towards wliich he shows a re
</p>
<p>pugnance only when it is excessive, and when he gets more than
</p>
<p>his due share by having the burden thrown upon him exclusively.
</p>
<p>Neither of these cases can apply to community, whore all being
</p>
<p>workers, the task of each is the mildest possible.
</p>
<p>To these motives of activity ought to be added the conviction
</p>
<p>which all would feel of the necessity of labour, the disgrace with
</p>
<p>which public opinion would brand the lazy man, and the seventy
</p>
<p>of the law, wnich would punish voluntary idleness with such
</p>
<p>pains as are now inflicted on thieves.
</p>
<p>4th Objection.  For the same reason there would he no more
</p>
<p>progress made in intellectual and industrial pursuits.
</p>
<p>Answer.  The frivolous productions which the stimulant" of a
</p>
<p>paltry salary elicits, and which have no value but in the eyes of
</p>
<p>vai.ity and laziness, would disappear never to return. Surely there
</p>
<p>could be no harm in that. But, undoubtedly, it would not be the
</p>
<p>same with respect to studies and researches, tending to strengthen
</p>
<p>the love of countiy, and to ameliorate the condition of all. To
</p>
<p>these people would devote themselves with unexampled ardour,
</p>
<p>inasmuch as they would generally have more leisure, and be en
</p>
<p>couraged by public gratitude, and by the attraction of wisely-
</p>
<p>decreed honours, which would be at all times the spring of grand

</p>
<p>actions and of inventions truly useful.
</p>
<p>5th Objection.  The mechanical regime and minutiae of com
</p>
<p>munity would make a sort of friary of civil society, and be in-
</p>
<p>j urious to liberty.
</p>
<p>Answer.  Monks, whether they have property or beg, do not
</p>
<p>apply themselves to any agricultural or industrial occupation ;
</p>
<p>whilst, in the community of Babeuf and Owen, every one serves
</p>
<p>the country by his industry. Monks practice celibacy ; but in
</p>
<p>community there is no renunciation of the conjugal union.
</p>
<p>Monks yield a blind obedience to their chiefs ; but in community
</p>
<p>we are subject only to the law in the formation, modification,
</p>
<p>and abrogation, of which all have a share. The lazy monks make
</p>
<p>the air resound with useless prayers, whereas under the system
</p>
<p>of equality we render to the divinity the only worship worthy of
</p>
<p>it, by the exercise of true charity. In fine, monks are constrained
</p>
<p>to conform all their actions to a severe rule ; the men of commu
</p>
<p>nity, on the contrary, have, with the exception of a few hours
</p>
<p>work a day, the disposal of their time according to their inclina
</p>
<p>tions and pleasure.
</p>
<p>To decide whether liberty of action is more respected in the
</p>
<p>222 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>institutions, without which the most popular Constitu
</p>
<p>tion will ever be a body without a soul, exposed to the
</p>
<p>fury of every faction.
</p>
<p>The following are some of the dispositions by which
</p>
<p>this proclamation was to be followed : 
</p>
<p>The immediate dissolution of all the existing civil and
</p>
<p>judicial authorities, and the outlawry of every individual
</p>
<p>who should dare to exercise the functions belonging to
</p>
<p>them. The immediate re-establishment of executive commis
</p>
<p>sions, of departmental and district administrations, of the
</p>
<p>municipalities, the revolutionary committees, the justices
</p>
<p>of the peace, and the criminal tribunals, the same as
</p>
<p>they were all before the 9th Thermidor of the Year II.
</p>
<p>An order to all citizens who exercised, at that period
</p>
<p>(9th Thermidor), any functions whatever in the aforesaid
</p>
<p>system of community, or in that of individual property, it suffices
</p>
<p>to consider that, under the latter, the majority of the population
</p>
<p>being, by necessity, subjected to long and painful drudgery, is
</p>
<p>always more or less deprived of the free use of its will, even while
</p>
<p>the law seems to insure to them its enjoyment. There will as
</p>
<p>suredly exist more of this liberty in a country where all work three
</p>
<p>or four hours per day, than in that where four-fifths of the popula
</p>
<p>tion are constrained to labour ten or twelve hours per day, in
</p>
<p>order that the remaining fifth may wallow in voluptuousness, and
</p>
<p>get depraved by sloth and luxury.
</p>
<p>6th Objection.  The life of community would make society retro
</p>
<p>grade to the state of barbarism.
</p>
<p>Answer.  The absence of the arts and sciences, united to gross-
</p>
<p>ness of manners, and violence of character, constitute what is
</p>
<p>commonly called barbarism. N ow, nothing of that sort would be a
</p>
<p>necessary consequence of community, such as Babeuf and Owen
</p>
<p>have conceived it. This community, so far from excluding the
</p>
<p>studies and industry which really contribute to the happiness and
</p>
<p>maintenance of society, would encourage them, by common in
</p>
<p>terest, by public opinion, and by leisure to pursue them. The

</p>
<p>sciences and arts, no longer supplying aliment to avarice and
</p>
<p>vanity, would soon get released from all that is neither true nor
</p>
<p>of general advantage. Again, the education in common, and the
</p>
<p>uninterrupted interchange of succours and benefits, would engen
</p>
<p>der in the feelings that fraternity which softens the manners, and
</p>
<p>tempers the impetuosity of character. By the suppression of
</p>
<p>misery and of meanness  inevitable consequences of individual
</p>
<p>property  would be banished from society that dissimulation and
</p>
<p>hypocrisy which now make it a field of battle, a veritable hell on
</p>
<p>earth. People would be good without disguise or artifice, and
</p>
<p>proud without brutality. So far from re-falling into barbarism, we
</p>
<p>should then discover the possibility of attaining, by the establish
</p>
<p>ment of community, a durable happiness, and a real and perfect
</p>
<p>civilization.

<p>to which the citizens of the departments should come

<p>and of uniting the Repubhcans, and espe- cieties-

<p>by the wisdom of their measures, by the warmth of their

<p>zeal, by their disinterestedness, and by their irreproach

<p>spread the light of equality in every commune, and par- 
</p>
<p>ticularly in the popular societies which were to be opened,
</p>
<p>so that public opinion might, as it were, light the way
</p>
<p>before the reforming acts of the legislature.
</p>
<p>Five projects of revolutionary decrees were submitted
</p>
<p>for discussion to the Insurrectional Committee, at the

<p>moment of its dissolution.  to wit : 1 . Regarding the

</p>
<p>houses of education ; this decree contained amongst
</p>
<p>many other articles the following: 
</p>
<p>Every Frenchman performs active service in the army
</p>
<p>from the age of twenty to that of twenty-five.
</p>
<p>No one can exercise a command in the army, unless
</p>
<p>he has carried arms as a simple soldier during . . . years.
</p>
<p>r- The soldiers concur in each corps, in the nomination
</p>
<p>of their chiefs, who are to be periodically removable.
</p>
<p>Military payments to be no more made in money. The
</p>
<p>Republic distributes daily a military ration to each in
</p>
<p>dividual composing the army. It lodges, clothes, yields
</p>
<p>an equal supply of light, firing, washing, and main
</p>
<p>tenance to all the defenders of the country.
</p>
<p>The military ration is the same as that of the public
</p>
<p>functionaries. The defenders of the country live in common under
</p>
<p>the direction of their chiefs, and according to the rules
</p>
<p>to be established.
</p>
<p>Individual pillage is forbid. Every defender of the
</p>
<p>country promises, before entering on the campaign, to
</p>
<p>carry to the administrators of the army whatever he may
</p>
<p>legitimately take from the enemy. After extraordinary
</p>
<p>fatigues, the soldiers who endured them, receive a more
</p>
<p>copious distribution of provisions.
</p>
<p>Insubordination is punished with death. The same
</p>
<p>penalty attaches to generals and officers who are found
</p>
<p>guilty of robbery, drunkenness on duty, rape, gaming,

</p>
<p>which we have spoken. In fact, no pains were to be
</p>
<p>spared in the training of infancy, which, having no
</p>
<p>formed habits, was in a disposition to contract whatever
</p>
<p>it might be desirable to impart to it. Every difficulty in
</p>
<p>that department reduced itself to this  to vanquish the
</p>
<p>BABEUF s CONSPIRACY. 227
</p>
<p>repugnance of certain families, and to find a sufficient
</p>
<p>number of men capable of directing houses of education
</p>
<p>in the spirit of the projected reform. The first obstacle
</p>
<p>we hoped to overcome by the influence of the Repub
</p>
<p>licans, by the enthusiasm about to be awakened by the
</p>
<p>propagation of the principles of equality, by the im
</p>
<p>mediate comfort which this measure was to bring to the
</p>
<p>indigent class, and by the evidence of the advantages
</p>
<p>which it was about to ensure to the children.
</p>
<p>As to the intelligence, morality, and capacity of those
</p>
<p>to whom was to be confided the direction of the houses
</p>
<p>of education, we calculated on securing them by the help
</p>
<p>of the Normal school, where we were to employ in
</p>
<p>forming them, the time necessary to accommodate the
</p>
<p>people to the new system, and to arrange the places
</p>
<p>where the youth was to be brought together. Let us
</p>
<p>succeed, said the Insurrectional Committee, in inducing
</p>
<p>the young people and the soldiers to contract an affection
</p>
<p>towards the manners of equality, and the most important
</p>
<p>part of our mission will be accomplished ; for, in a few
</p>
<p>years, these young people and soldiers will compose
</p>
<p>the great bulk of the nation; however, not to render
</p>
<p>useless the good dispositions which the national education
</p>
<p>will have given them, let us not suffer them to find, on
</p>
<p>entering society, any social order opposed to its effects.
</p>
<p>Let the destruction of the spirit of individual property
</p>
<p>commence simultaneously, and march in front of the
</p>
<p>progress of the youth and of the army, in the doc
</p>
<p>trines and in the manners of equality. To this end it
</p>
<p>was, that the Committee designed the Economical
</p>
<p>Decree. This decree embraced every part of the Economical de-
</p>
<p>public administration : agriculture, arts, crees
</p>
<p>commerce, navigation : the finances, and public works,
</p>
<p>came within its province, and were destined to receive
</p>
<p>new life from it.

<p>It is understood, that the establishment of the grand
</p>
<p>and perfect national community was the ultimate object
</p>
<p>of the labours of the Committee. Nevertheless it would
</p>
<p>have been very cautious in making it the object of a
</p>
<p>social order, immediately after its triumph, and of com
</p>
<p>pelling opposing parties to take part in it; all individual
</p>
<p>228 babeufs conspiracy.
</p>
<p>violence, all innovation not ordered by the laws, would
</p>
<p>have been interdicted and punished. The Committee
</p>
<p>was of opinion that the legislator ought to act in such a
</p>
<p>way as to determine the mass of the people to proscribe
</p>
<p>property from necessity and from interest.
</p>
<p>But how induce such numbers of persons, depraved
</p>
<p>by idleness, by factitious enjoyments, and by vanity, to
</p>
<p>desire a state of simplicity to which they had opposed so
</p>
<p>sharp a resistance ? By establishing through the laws,
</p>
<p>replied the Committee, a public order in which the
</p>
<p>rich, while they keep their wealth, shall find no more
</p>
<p>abundance pleasures, or consideration than the rest of
</p>
<p>society. Let us, it added, enable all industrious men to
</p>
<p>enjoy, in return for a very moderate labour, and without
</p>
<p>wages, an honourable and certain competence, and
</p>
<p>soon will the bandage fall from the eyes of the citizens
</p>
<p>led astray by prejudices, and by the routine of fashion.
</p>
<p>It will then happen that the proprietors of wealth, or of
</p>
<p>its representative money, forced to offer a superior work
</p>
<p>manship to the commodious and gratuitous maintenance
</p>
<p>of the public works guaranteed by the Republic, and to
</p>
<p>expend the greater part of their incomes in costs of
</p>
<p>culture, preparations, and imposts  no longer able to
</p>
<p>procure themselves any extra pleasures, or services ; op
</p>
<p>pressed under the weight of oppressive taxes, shut out
</p>
<p>from the administration of affairs, deprived of all in
</p>
<p>fluence, despised, forming in the state only, as it were,
</p>
<p>a suspected class of foreigners, they will either emigrate,
</p>
<p>by disposing of their effects, or will hasten to seal, by
</p>
<p>their voluntary adhesion, the pacific and universal estab
</p>
<p>lishment of the community.*
</p>
<p>Let us invite to join us, added the Committee, the
</p>

<p>in connexion with it, the fragment of the Economical Decree, in

<p>their labour, a commodious living, secure from reverses,
</p>
<p>and relieved from the apprehensions and cares, which
</p>
<p>are no less the effects of possession than of poverty ; let
</p>
<p>us create from this moment a grand national commu
</p>
<p>nity ; let us endow it with an immense territory ; let us
</p>
<p>incorporate with it all the real estate, over which the
</p>
<p>nation or the communes have rights to exercise ; let us
</p>
<p>confer on those who will make over to it an absolute
</p>
<p>surrender of their persons and property, the impre
</p>
<p>scriptible right to every thing that constitutes a pro
</p>
<p>sperity such as all may participate in ; let us see that
</p>
<p>this prosperity be real and immediate ; let us prevent
</p>
<p>coxcomb witlings from coming to disturb it by sophisms
</p>
<p>and exaggerations ; let us force all the ramifications of
</p>
<p>authority to march in the sense of equality ; let us
</p>
<p>receive into the country's bosom all who seek an asylum
</p>
<p>in it with good intentions ; let us dry up every source
</p>
<p>whence pride might still derive the means of displaying
</p>
<p>before the people the illusions of a deceitful pomp ; let
</p>
<p>us render gold more onerous to its possessors than sand
</p>
<p>and stones ; let us strike the first blows with boldness
</p>
<p>and firmness, and then leave to man's natural desire of
</p>
<p>happiness and to wisdom, to complete, by progressive
</p>
<p>changes, so sublime an enterprize.
</p>
<p>This preparatory operation once consummated, the
</p>
<p>nation would have existence only in those participating
</p>
<p>in the community ; but every thing inclined the Insur
</p>
<p>rectional Committee to think that the community would
</p>
<p>soon amalgamate itself with the entire nation, by the
</p>
<p>successive returns of the defenders of the country, by the
</p>
<p>incorporation of the possessions of non-participators de

</p>
<p>opinion, which would have been the infallible conse

<p>quence of such a reformation. The day would have

<p>without danger, substituted for exhortations, example,
</p>
<p>and the force of necessity. Then and from that time
</p>
<p>the word proprietor would begin to signify something
</p>
<p>barbarous or outlandish to the French.
</p>
<p>In speaking of the assemblies of the Decrees re-
</p>
<p>peode, we have made mention of national specting the na-
</p>
<p>ferti'vals, and of the principles upon which tl0nal festlval3'
</p>
<p>220 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>the Committee reckoned upon instituting them. The same
</p>
<p>spirit reigned in the Revolutionary project which it dis
</p>
<p>cussed a short time before its dissolution. Those fes
</p>
<p>tivals would have been numerous and varied. All the
</p>
<p>days of rest would have been devoted to them. In the
</p>
<p>Committee's opinion, it was of sovereign importance to
</p>
<p>the cause of equality to keep the citizens incessantly
</p>
<p>exercised  to attach them to their country, by making
</p>
<p>them love its ceremonies, its games, its amusements 
</p>
<p>to banish ennui from all their leisure moments, and to
</p>
<p>cherish and fortify, by frequent intercourse, sentiments
</p>
<p>of fraternity amongst all parts of the Republic.
</p>
<p>Upon the consolidation of those institutions, and
</p>
<p>especially of those which the Economical Decree was to
</p>
<p>establish, depended, as the Committee thought, the
</p>
<p>accomplishment of the Revolution and complete exer
</p>
<p>cise of the popular sovereignty. In other words, that
</p>
<p>the day on which the people should enter into the
</p>
<p>peaceable enjoyment of equality, would have been that
</p>
<p>on which it would be able to exercise, in all its pleni
</p>
<p>tude, the right of deliberating on its laws, as consecrated
</p>
<p>by the Constitution of 1793.

<p>have preserved it from the troubles and dangers to
</p>
<p>which old habits, and the snares of the wicked, would
</p>
<p>have infallibly exposed it.

<p>successive and simultaneous progression of the institu
</p>
<p>tions and of the Constitution. It will be easily felt
</p>
<p>that the Insurrectional Committee itself could neither
</p>
<p>foresee all the measures which circumstances might have
</p>
<p>rendered necessary, nor determined beforehand the
</p>
<p>epoch when the mission of the reformer would have
</p>
<p>been completed.
</p>
<p>Who could calculate all the resistance of alarmed
</p>
<p>BABEUF S CONSPIRACY. 231
</p>
<p>passions ? Who could predict to what extent the ex
</p>
<p>ternal enemies of the Republic would have multiplied
</p>
<p>their efforts against the new Reformation, which, un
</p>
<p>doubtedly, would have been more odious to them than
</p>
<p>all preceding ones ? Its calculations and foresight must
</p>
<p>have necessarily depended on the celerity with which
</p>
<p>the democratic opinion resumed its former ascendancy.
</p>
<p>We can only be certain, from the well-known views of
</p>
<p>the conspirators, that, so far as they were concerned,
</p>
<p>foreign hostilities would not have been prolonged a
</p>
<p>single day, either through the ambition of conquest and
</p>
<p>domination, or the jealousies of commerce.
</p>
<p>So manv and such vast efforts, to Arrest of the
</p>
<p>which some merit will not be refused, consPllatOTS-
</p>
<p>were frustrated by the treachery of Grisel. Aided by
</p>
<p>the wiles of this perfidious villain, the oppressors of
</p>
<p>France succeeded in arresting, on the morning of the
</p>
<p>21st Floreal of the Year IV., the greater part of the
</p>
<p>chiefs of the conspiracy.* Babeuf and Buonarroti were
</p>
<p>seized, in the midst of some papers, in the chambers
</p>
<p>where they had passed the night, meditating and pre
</p>
<p>paring for the insurrection and subsequent reforms.
</p>
<p>Darthe, Germain, Eriddy, Drouet, and several others,
</p>
<p>were arrested at the same time at Dufour's house,
</p>
<p>where they were met together to fix the day of the
</p>
<p>popular movement. The army of the interior, under
</p>
<p>* At this epoch commenced the brilliant campaign of Italy,
</p>
<p>which paved the way to supreme power for an audacious soldier
</p>
<p>(Buonaparte). Thenceforward the love of liberty began to give
</p>
<p>place, in the hearts of Frenchmen, to that of military glory, and to
</p>
<p>the passion for conquests, which subsequently proved the most
</p>
<p>active cause of their reverses, and total subjugation under the
</p>
<p>Holy Alliance. Judging from all appearances, the success of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, of which we have just given the history, would, by

<p>tion of Buonaparte, and from the disastrous consequences of those

<p>plausible advantage to replunge France under the yoke of its old
</p>
<p>masters (Bourbons), by unchaining against her (by the aid of
</p>
<p>insidious promises of liberty) the several nations, whose jealousy
</p>
<p>was roused by the dazzling success of the Revolution, and which
</p>
<p>were soured against us by the evils of a war of invasion and of

<p>BABEUF'S CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>TRIAL AND JUSTIFICATIVE PIECES.
</p>
<p>CRIMINAL PROCESS.
</p>
<p>The imprisonment of the conspirators, Imprisomnent.
</p>
<p>and the announcement of the conspiracy,
</p>
<p>produced a variety of sensations ; affliction and amazement
</p>
<p>amongst the oppressed classes  yells of horror and fero
</p>
<p>cious joy amongst the upper . and affluent classes, who
</p>
<p>uttered howls of death against the " Babouvists." The
</p>
<p>numerous papers seized with Babeuf, enabled the aris
</p>
<p>tocracy to discover the means of annihilating the party
</p>
<p>it dreaded. Immediately were the dungeons of the Abbaye filled
</p>
<p>with the accused, who were dragged there amidst demon
</p>
<p>strations of the most intense interest for their fate, lavished
</p>
<p>upon them by the people and the soldiery. For several
</p>
<p>days the crowd blocked up the streets adjacent to that
</p>
<p>prison ; but the accused were soon separated, and those
</p>
<p>who appeared most compromised were put au secret in
</p>
<p>the towers of the Temple ! Almost all of these expected
</p>
<p>to perish immediately by the sentence of a military com
</p>
<p>mission : Drouet saved them from that fate.

<p>By the Constitution of the Year III., a Drouet eras-

</p>
<p>and by a High Court of Justice, the jurors of which were at
</p>
<p>the choice of the Electoral Assemblies of the Departments.
</p>
<p>Several mouths were required to form this extraordinary
</p>
<p>tribunal, which could not hold its sittings near the com
</p>
<p>mune where the Government resided. Drouet, one of
</p>
<p>the accused, was a Deputy, and the judgment of the
</p>
<p>rest was necessarily suspended, until it might be known
</p>
<p>whether Drouet could carry with him to his tribunal
</p>
<p>those whose accomplice he appeared to be. Two days
</p>
<p>after his incarceration Babeuf addressed the following
</p>
<p>letter to the Executive Directory :

</p>
<p>" that you have stripped it of every popular form and safe-

</p>
<p>" you. To this determination they would not have come,
</p>
<p>" had you, as you seemed to promise after Vendemiaire,
</p>
<p>" put yourselves in train to govern popularly. I, myself,
</p>
<p>" in the early numbers of my paper, wished to open the

<p>Democrats, and through them, the people, would have
</p>
<p>spared the Republic the subsequent struggles so dis
</p>
<p>astrous to it, and themselves the calamities which ul
</p>
<p>timately overtook them.* Such was the object of
</p>
<p>Babeuf's proposal, which he urged as much for the sake
</p>
<p>of sparing his friends, as in order to restore to the Re
</p>
<p>publican spirit its expiring vigour. But can alarmed

<p>shrewdness and knowledge of human nature. The worst that was
</p>
<p>likely to happen the Executive Directors, from the triumph of
</p>
<p>Royalism, was the loss of their power, which they might, at any
</p>
<p>time of danger, commute for something substantial, in money or
</p>
<p>lands, as Barras subsequently did when he struck his clandestine
</p>
<p>bargain with Buonaparte to facilitate that usurper's success ;
</p>
<p>whereas, had Babeuf s party triumphed, the best that could happen
</p>
<p>the said Directors was to have the precarious and perilous honour
</p>
<p>of serving the Republic without plunder or estates, and under the
</p>
<p>awful surveillance of the " Insurrectional Committee." What
</p>
<p>value the murderers of Robespierre would have set on such barren

<p>distinction, Buonarroti ought to have known too well not to see
</p>
<p>the impossibility of their forming any connexion with the Equah

<p>tarians or Democrats. And, as to what he says of the subsequent
</p>
<p>struggles and disasters of the Republic, what cared Barras and Co.
</p>
<p>about them, so long as they could feather their own nests? Men of
</p>
<p>that stamp regard the calamities of their country about as much as

<p>the very name, and of proscribing in their persons the

<p>only men from whom the Republic could reasonably ex

</p>
<p>The revolutionary Aristocrats thought only of mo
</p>
<p>mentarily profiting by a victory they owed to an in
</p>
<p>famous treason, to crush the party which condemned
</p>
<p>their usurpation. Articles of impeachment were drawn
</p>
<p>up against Drouet, and he was sent before the High

<p>Court of Justice, whose sittings were fixed to be held at

<p>signs to him, by any commission, or by any privileges
</p>
<p>other than those determined by an anterior law.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a law posterior to the discovery of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, decided that the Deputy (Drouet) should
</p>
<p>drag his co-accused with him before the High Court,
</p>
<p>which was not the tribunal assigned to them by law.
</p>
<p>Again, said the same Constitution  there is for the

<p>dered that the judgments of the High Court, which was
</p>
<p>notoriously a tribunal, should not be subject to appeal.
</p>
<p>These provisions, contrary to the letter of the Constitu

<p>tion, were attributed by Drouet' s associates in misfortune
</p>
<p>to the fear entertained by Government of a public debate

</p>
<p>At the same time, spies were on the watch all over the
</p>
<p>Republic to hunt out pretences, however trivial, for
</p>
<p>swelling the number of accused, of whom the rulers of
</p>
<p>the day flattered themselves that the High Court would

<p>make a complete hecatomb. Cherbourg, Arras, Rochfort,

<p>cused, but all such manifestly utter strangers to the affair
</p>
<p>thata shadow of reproach could not be urged against them.

<p>E i ns Whilst they were getting up at Paris

<p>the tragedy to be played at Vendome,
</p>
<p>the Parisian Democrats were agitating to deliver their

<p>escape of the prisoners in the Temple, which had been

<p>concerted with the soldiers placed to guard them, mis

<p>carried for want of necessary accord in the plan.
</p>
<p>Pache was the only man out of prison that openly
</p>
<p>embraced, in a printed paper, the opinions and cause
</p>
<p>of the accused. Some periodic writers opposed a feeble
</p>
<p>barrier to the torrent of invectives which burst upon the
</p>
<p>prisoners, but they did it without skill or courage, some
</p>
<p>times by denying palpable facts, at other times insinu

<p>ating that the Government had secretly instigated the

<p>conspiracy ; at no time did they dare to start the ques

<p>cited against them. The convoy traversed Paris in the

</p>
<p>the accused, had frequently to endure the inclemencies of
</p>
<p>the atmosphere and the gibes of the Aristocrats. The
</p>
<p>prisoners themselves had a deal to suffer from the bru
</p>
<p>tality of the officer who commanded their escort ; but
</p>
<p>they had reason to be proud of the reception, full of
</p>
<p>sympathetic regard, which they experienced from the
</p>
<p>municipal administrations of Chartres and of Cha-
</p>
<p>teaudun. At Vendome there was expressly prepared for them a
</p>
<p>tribunal and a spacious court-house, in which the ac
</p>
<p>cused present were locked up for the night of the 19th
</p>
<p>Fructidor. Antonelle and Fion, arrested subsequently
</p>
<p>to the impeachment  as also the accused from Rochfort,
</p>
<p>Cherbourg, and Arras, entered there in succession some
</p>
<p>time after. Troops of every description guarded with
</p>
<p>strictest severity the approaches to the prison, as well as
</p>
<p>the entrances to the town, to which a specific law for
</p>
<p>the occasion interdicted all access nearer than ten
</p>
<p>leagues round. The intention was to ward off from the
</p>
<p>debate every species of publicity.
</p>
<p>The time which elapsed between the arrival of the
</p>
<p>accused and the opening of the sittings of the High
</p>
<p>Court, was employed by it in constituting itself, in giving
</p>
<p>notice of the contumacious, in forming the jury, and in
</p>
<p>judging the demands and exceptions taken by the ac
</p>
<p>cused against the Court's jurisdiction. The latter availed
</p>
<p>themselves of the time to protest, to agree on the chal
</p>
<p>lenges which they had the right to exercise, and to con
</p>
<p>cert and prepare their defence.
</p>
<p>By the unconstitutional decrees already protests.
</p>
<p>spoken of, a wide field was opened for
</p>
<p>protests on the part of the accused. Several of them, in
</p>
<p>denying the competence of the High Court, surmised
</p>
<p>the possibility of raising between it and the legislative
</p>
<p>body a contest which might lead to events favourable to

<p>the popular cause. Vain hope ! The Hight Court de

<p>clared itself competent.
</p>
<p>Upon the totality of the jurors named CnaUenges.
</p>
<p>by the electoral assembhes, the accused
</p>
<p>had the right of exercising thirty challenges. This was
</p>
<p>a very grave operation, as upon it might depend the
</p>
<p>fate of a great number of the prisoners. By help of
</p>
<p>244 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>some imperfect and frequently erroneous information,
</p>
<p>collected in the departments, the accused agreed, after
</p>
<p>deliberating together, upon the names to be rejected.
</p>
<p>Thirty of the accused distributed the privilege amongst
</p>
<p>themselves, in such manner that each might challenge
</p>
<p>one name. The elections of the Year IV., however,
</p>
<p>having in many places been made in the absence of the
</p>
<p>Republicans proscribed, or violently expelled from the
</p>
<p>assemblies, and under the influence of the enemies of
</p>
<p>the Revolution, it was impossible to leave on the list of
</p>
<p>jurors only true friends of liberty. Force was to content
</p>
<p>itself with the less bad. Amongst those who merited
</p>
<p>an entire confidence, some were excluded by the Tri
</p>
<p>bunal as relations of emigrants  others, sacrificing to
</p>
<p>fear, feigned illness, and were excused; three were pre
</p>
<p>sent at the trial.
</p>
<p>Courageous f From the moment Babeuf was deprived
</p>
<p>avowals of of liberty his first thought was to avow
</p>
<p>the conspiracy, and to maintain its legiti
</p>
<p>macy. The legitimacy is demonstrated in his replies to
</p>
<p>the Minister of Police, who demanded whether he had
</p>
<p>intended to overthrow the Government, and if he had
</p>
<p>combined with certain parties for that purpose ? Here
</p>
<p>are his answers :-" Convinced in my heart that the
</p>
<p>" existing Government is one of oppression, I would have
</p>
<p>" done all in my power to overthrow it. As to my ac-
</p>
<p>" complices, they are all the Democrats of the Republic ;
</p>
<p>" it is no part of my duty to name them. Being ques
</p>
<p>tioned by the same Minister respecting the means he
</p>
<p>counted upon employing, he replied, " all the means
</p>
<p>" legitimate against tyrants." And a little after :  " It
</p>
<p>'; is not my business to give the details of the means
</p>
<p>" attempted to be employed. Besides, they did not
</p>
<p>" depend on me alone. I had but a single voice in the
</p>
<p>" Council of Tyrannicides."

<p>Interrogated some days afterwards by the foreman of
</p>
<p>the jury, he replied thus, to the imputation of his being
</p>
<p>pthe author of the conspiracy :  " I attest, then, that too
</p>
<p>l " much honour is done me, in decorating me with the
</p>
<p>" title of Chief of the Conspiracy; I declare that I had
</p>
<p>" not ever more than a secondary part in it  a part
</p>
<p>" limited to what I am about to tell. I gave my sanction
</p>
<p>babeuf's conspiracy. 245

</p>
<p>" because I believed, and believe still, that the existing

</p>

</p>
<p>" it has reduced to the most pitiful destitution, to the
</p>
<p>" most deplorable slavery; guilty, in short, of treason to i
</p>
<p>" the national sovereignty ; and that I believed, and do 1
</p>
<p>" still believe, in the soundness of the principle, that it is
</p>
<p>" the rigorous duty of all free men to conspire against?'
</p>
<p>" such a Government; accordingly did I voluntarily
</p>
<p>" consent to aid, with all my resources, the chiefs and
</p>
<p>'' leaders of a conspiracy which was formed against it."
</p>
<p>And after having established the part he had played in
</p>
<p>the conspiracy, he added :  " Behold details which,
</p>
<p>" no doubt, will destroy the absurd supposition that I
</p>
<p>" was chief of the conspiracy, and that, founded on the bare
</p>
<p>" circumstance that I was found, at the moment of my
</p>
<p>" arrest, with a portion of the papers of the conspirators
</p>
<p>"- about me. I repeat the fact, without meaning thereby
</p>
<p>" to extenuate my culpability ; I only desire to act /
</p>
<p>" honestly, and not to appear in a more brilliant character
</p>
<p>" than I merit  a character that is not mine. I consent,
</p>
<p>" however, after that acknowledgment, to endure the
</p>
<p>" severest penaltv awarded against the crime of plotting
</p>
<p>" against oppressors ; for I still own, that as regards in-
</p>
<p>" tention, no one has conspired against them more reso-
</p>
<p>" lutely than myself. I am convinced that it is a crime
</p>
<p>" common to all Frenchman, at least to all the virtuous
</p>
<p>" part  to all that are not wedded to the frightful system
</p>
<p>" of founding the happiness of a very small number upon

<p>" the degradation and extreme misery of the mass ; I
</p>
<p>" declare myself fully convicted of the crime charged,
</p>
<p>" and I declare that it was the crime of all the conspi-

</p>
<p>were kept constantly shut up. It being impossible to
</p>
<p>concert matters with Babeuf, who was deemed the best-
</p>
<p>informed of the affair, the other conspirators, through
</p>
<p>fear of contradicting themselves or of compromising one
</p>
<p>another, were to consign to him the care of giving expla

<p>protested against the legality of the procedure.
</p>
<p>Had it not been for the weakness of Pille, arrested
</p>
<p>with Babeuf and Buonarroti, his handwriting, and that of
</p>
<p>several of the accused, would have remained unknown.
</p>
<p>Foolishly fearing that the numerous copies he had made
</p>
<p>of the Acts of the Insurrectional Committee, whose sec
</p>
<p>retary he had been, would draw down upon his head
</p>
<p>the accusation of having dipped actively in the plot, he
</p>
<p>hastened to declare what he had done and seen, and to
</p>
<p>make known the authors of the manuscripts he had tran
</p>
<p>scribed. This prisoner, whose timid conduct produced
</p>
<p>fatal consequences, played the part of a simpleton in
</p>
<p>prison and during the trial, with great skill. In presence
</p>
<p>of the High Court, he pretended that a malevolent spirit
</p>
<p>had driven him to Babeuf s house. He declared that one
</p>
<p>might have a compact with a demon, either to be pro

<p>tected by him or to hurt somebody, and demanded to
</p>
<p>speak, to give, as he said, some details ! Not one of the
</p>
<p>accused, really compromised, quailed or staggered before
</p>
<p>the capital and impending danger which menaced them.
</p>
<p>All remained unalterable in their attachment to the doc

</p>
<p>their blood. Nobody was compromised by their decla

</p>
<p>the first plan was rejected, and it was agreed that the

<p>be hypothetically defended, and that an attempt should
</p>
<p>be made to give plausible explications of the documents

<p>seized, and of the facts proved.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the testimony of the informer detailed

<p>alone as to the main point of the accusation, he was so
</p>
<p>strongly corroborated by the numerous and overwhelming

<p>writings of the accused, that it seemed impossible, all
</p>
<p>political considerations apart, for any honest man to
</p>
<p>deny, after the slightest examination, the reality of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy. From that moment, the gravely-compro

<p>for the debates, Antonelle executed be
</p>
<p>forehand for pubhc opinion. This generous citizen made
</p>
<p>then the noblest use of his talents and of his wealth.
</p>
<p>Although no legal presumption was raised against him
</p>
<p>self, he frankly espoused the cause of his incarcerated
</p>
<p>friends; by numerous writings he disposed the public to
</p>
<p>248 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>favourably receive their defence, and from the depth of
</p>
<p>his dungeon he unsparingly accused the Government,
</p>
<p>rendered homage to the Constitution of 1793, justified
</p>
<p>the intentions of the conspirators, and dared almost to
</p>
<p>declare himself their accomplice. At this calamitous
</p>
<p>epoch, nearly all that there was of energy in the Re
</p>
<p>public was locked up in the prison of Vendome. There
</p>
<p>the accused mutually encouraged one another to serve
</p>
<p>the people, by showing an example of unflinching firm
</p>
<p>ness, and they lived in the most democratic fraternity.
</p>
<p>The shades of difference remarked between the Equals
</p>
<p>and the Ex-Conventionalists, did not prevent their har
</p>
<p>mony from being complete ; it increased every day by the
</p>
<p>comparison and mutual conciliation of their opinions,
</p>
<p>as well as by the fidelity with which each discharged his
</p>
<p>duty before the tribunal. In the evening Republican
</p>
<p>songs, in which all the prisoners took part, re-echoed in
</p>
<p>the distance ; and the inhabitants of Vendome, attracted by
</p>
<p>sympathy and curiosity to a neighbouring lull, frequently
</p>
<p>mingled with them their own voices and applauses.
</p>
<p>For men who had dared so much in favour of a cause
</p>
<p>they were devoted to, the fate of the Republic was ne
</p>
<p>cessarily the permanent subject of their conversations
</p>
<p>and anxieties. To one and the other, new aliment was
</p>
<p>supplied by another horrid calamity. Hardly had the
</p>
<p>accused arrived at Vendome, when they were apprised
</p>
<p>of the fatal event of Grenelle, where, in consequence of
</p>
<p>a murderous ambuscade, the bulk of the democratic
</p>
<p>party lost their lives in a generous attempt to liberate
</p>
<p>the imprisoned patriots, and to re-establish the rights of
</p>
<p>the people. By this horrible butchery, the power of the
</p>
<p>Aristocracy was increased by all the strength lost to the
</p>
<p>Democrats.* * This unfortunate affair of Grenelle is thus described by
</p>
<p>Mignet : " Their partisans made a last attempt. In the night of
</p>
<p>the 7th September (23d Fructidor), about eleven o'clock, they

</p>
<p>sabres and pistols, against the Directory, which, however, they
</p>
<p>found defended by its guards. They then proceeded to the camp
</p>
<p>of Grenelle, which, from the 'supposed understanding between
</p>
<p>themselves and it, they had hopes of gaining over. The camp
</p>
<p>had retired to rest, when the conspirators arrived. When the
</p>
<p>stinels demanded ' Who goes there V they replied ' Long live
</p>
<p>the Republic ! Long live the Constitution of 93 !' The centinels
</p>
<p>immediately gave the alarm. The conspirators, relying upon the
</p>

</p>
<p>Shortly after, some Royalist conspirators, emissaries
</p>
<p>of the proscribed dynasty, and surprised in the overt
</p>
<p>act, were treated with a scandalous indulgence bv a
</p>
<p>great part of the Legislature, which openly protected
</p>
<p>them, as well as by the Military Commission which
</p>
<p>tried them. About the same epoch, the tribunals
</p>
<p>charged to try the contumacious of the 13th Vende
</p>
<p>miaire (Royalists),* declared not proven the conspiracy
</p>
<p>which that day deluged the city of Paris with blood.
</p>
<p>This judicial compliance displeased the Ministry, /
</p>
<p>fear, said one of its members, that it will prove a bad
</p>
<p>example for the prisoners of Vendome; it is breaking
</p>
<p>the ice for their escape. It was of our conspirators,
</p>
<p>indeed, that the Government most desired to rid itself.
</p>
<p>At last the debates were opened on Opening of the
</p>
<p>the 2d Ventdse of the Year V. There judicial debates.
</p>
<p>were forty-seven accused present; eighteen were tried
</p>
<p>in their absence, being contumacious.! Babeuf, Darthe,
</p>
<p>assistance of a battalion of the guard which had been reduced,
</p>
<p>marched towards the tent of Jlalo, the commander, who ordered
</p>
<p>his men to sound to horse, and his dragoons, who were half-naked,
</p>
<p>to mount. The conspirators, surprised at this reception, made
</p>
<p>but a feeble resistance ; they were put to flight, leaving a number
</p>
<p>of dead, and many prisoners, on the field of battle. This unfor
</p>
<p>tunate expedition was almost the last of the party ; at each suc
</p>
<p>cessive defeat it lost its energy and its leaders, and at length
</p>
<p>acquired the secret conviction that its reign was at an end. The
</p>
<p>enterprise of Grenelle proved a very disastrous affair to it; for,
</p>
<p>besides its losses in the engagement, it suffered considerably be
</p>
<p>fore the military commissions, which were as fatal to it as the
</p>
<p>revolutionary tribunals had been to its enemies. The commission
</p>
<p>at the camp of Grenelle, at five times, condemned thirty-one of
</p>
<p>the conspirators to death, thirty to transportation, and twenty-five

<p>to imprisonment."  Bronterre.

<p>before the High Court only through the rage of the ruling

<p>party, who meant to use this tribunal for the extermina

<p>tion of the democracy.
</p>
<p>A numerous armed force guarded the tribunal; each

<p>prisoner was placed between two gendarmes. The court

<p>was spacious, and the enclosed space reserved for the
</p>
<p>public was always crowded with people, who frequently

<p>applauded the accused  -never the accusers. We had a

<p>refusing to answer questions, or give explanations, and

<p>suffered himself to be condemned without a defence.

<p>After reiterating his first protest before the jury, he deli

<p>vered the following words:  "For myself, if Providence

</p>
<p> they attributed to that faction all the commotions and

<p>was heard in their defence) to identify with it the accused
</p>
<p>whom the High Court was just going to try for their

</p>
<p>upon it, and in the little they said of it, they denaturalized

<p>from convincing France that their views were benevolent,
</p>
<p>that their opposition to the Constitution of the Year III.

</p>
<p>may expressed a possibility without limitation, and
</p>
<p>comprised such rewards as the informer of the conspi
</p>
<p>racy might reasonably expect from Government.
</p>
<p>The expedient hit upon by the national accusers, to
</p>
<p>extricate themselves from this embarassing argument
</p>
<p>of the accused, excited universal laughter. They
</p>
<p>babeuf's conspiracy 255
</p>
<p>had the impudence to maintain that the term informer
</p>
<p>was not applicable to Grisel ; because, said they, having
</p>
<p>made his first declaration to the Directory, and not to an
</p>
<p>officer of judiciary police, he was but a simple discloser
</p>
<p>(revelateur) !
</p>
<p>This subterfuge was not successful; He is a witness.
</p>
<p>nevertheless the Court, having ruled that
</p>
<p>the signification of the word may was to be limited to
</p>
<p>advantages accruing, of right, to the informer in con
</p>
<p>sequence of the mformations, ordered, to the great
</p>
<p>scandal of many persons, that Grisel should be heard.
</p>
<p>In support of the prosecution, there were about five
</p>
<p>hundred documents presented in evidence, and several
</p>
<p>sittings were occupied in handing them to the accused
</p>
<p>for recognition, or in verifying, by expert witnesses,
</p>
<p>those attributed to the prisoners who did not make .
</p>
<p>answer, or were contumacious.
</p>
<p>All manner of conjectures were ex- Tumult.
</p>
<p>hausted to ascertain, in a document to
</p>
<p>which the accusers attached great importance, certain
</p>
<p>words which Babeuf had covered with a great blot of ink,
</p>
<p>in flourishing his signature to it, at the house of the Mi
</p>
<p>nister of Police. The fastidious discussion which took
</p>
<p>place on this subject occasioned violent invectives on
</p>
<p>both sides, and ended in a frightful tumult. The sitting
</p>
<p>was abruptly adjourned, amidst cries of the accusers, the
</p>
<p>advocates, and the accused; the latter, as they retired,
</p>
<p>chaunted with vehemence the couplet of the Marseillais
</p>
<p>hymn, " Tremblez tyrans, et vous perfides !" The
</p>
<p>Court prepared a minute of the whole, on which the
</p>
<p>legislative body passed to the order of the day.
</p>
<p>In consequence of a reproach addressed by the ac
</p>
<p>cused to the President, the accusers complained that
</p>
<p>there was a design, by crowding incident upon incident,
</p>
<p>to indefinitely prolong the debates. " So many indig

</p>
<p>this Court's proceedings !" " What, are these voices so

</p>
<p>" that caste audaciously called respectable, which is

<p>" but a speck in comparison with the mass, but which

<p>Grisel spoke during two sittings, and Deposition of

</p>
<p>to find out, second, deceive, and betray the accused.
</p>
<p>He spoke truth, saving some additions dictated by
</p>
<p>vanity, and by which he succeeded at times in contra
</p>
<p>dicting himself. But, though he could not be regarded
</p>
<p>as a liar, people were not the less revolted at the effron
</p>
<p>tery with which he paraded his perfidy, and the
</p>
<p>stratagems by means of which he had gained the good
</p>
<p>will of the persons he was plotting to destroy. By a
</p>
<p>natural movement of indignation, Antonelle painted to
</p>
<p>the life the traitor's hypocrisy, and stamped upon his
</p>
<p>forehead the ineffaceable seal of infamy.
</p>
<p>In speaking of certain accused, Grisel had said," I
</p>
<p>" see here only agents ; not one of them was the real
</p>
<p>" chief of the conspiracy. There were men behind the
</p>
<p>" curtain who made these move and act at their

</p>
<p>following phrases :  " Ah ! since we are not victims

<p>' enough for you, go to the banks of the Aude, and
</p>
<p>" drag from under the sand that covers it the carcase of

<p>" it ; go. What ! does not this allurement tempt you?

<p>words with which Germain ended his eloquent defence

<p>are not less remarkable :  " I await your verdict," said

<p>Grisel had spoken of the insurrection Babeuf justifies

<p>sions implicating some of the accused at Vendome ; it
</p>
<p>was to confirm these admissions that they were trans

<p>expectations of the accusers, Meunier and Barbier boldly
</p>
<p>disavowed what they had had the weakness to confess,
</p>
<p>and preferred exposing themselves to a new condemna

<p>the men on their trial before the Court. They did more :
</p>
<p>they bowed respectfully to the accused ; greeted them
</p>
<p>with Republican hymns; called them friends of the

</p>
<p>in his defence than Babeuf, in conse

<p>quence of the resolution which had been taken by com

<p>five hundred documentary proofs  almost all of them

<p>avowed, and to which they submitted only from con

</p>
<p>avowals they made of their democratic doctrines, in the
</p>
<p>solemn homage they rendered to the Constitution of
</p>
<p>1793, and in the perseverance with which they hypo-
</p>
<p>BABEUF S CONSPIRACY. 261
</p>
<p>thetically justified the object of the conspiracy. This
</p>
<p>conspiracy was all comprised in the Act creating the
</p>
<p>Insurrectional Directory, which the accusers called an
</p>
<p>usurpation of sovereignty ; it was on this document
</p>
<p>that the accusation mainly rested. Babeuf justified its
</p>
<p>motives, intentions, and means of execution.
</p>
<p>" This is not," said he, " a trial of individuals  it is
</p>
<p>" that of the Republic ; in despite of all who hold a
</p>
<p>" different opinion, it must be treated with all the gran-
</p>
<p>" deur, majesty, and devotion which so all-powerful an
</p>
<p>" interest demands This act," continued he, " be-
</p>
<p>' longs to any and every Republican, and all Republicans
</p>
<p>" are implicated ,in this affair ; consequently it belongs
</p>
<p>" to the Repubhc  to the Revolution  to history : my
</p>
<p>" duty is to defend it." A moment after, comparing
</p>
<p>his actual position with that of the non-imprisoned
</p>
<p>Democrats  " Genius of Liberty !" he exclaimed, " what
</p>
<p>" thanks ought I not to render you for having placed
</p>
<p>" me in a position in which I am more free than all
</p>
<p>" other men, from the very fact that I am in fetters !
</p>
<p>" How grand is my position ! How beautiful my cause !
</p>
<p>" it permits me exclusively to use the language of truth.
</p>
<p>" ... .In the midst of my chains my tongue is privileged
</p>
<p>" beyond all others of the countless number of oppressed
</p>
<p>" and unhappy citizens, for each of whom the tyrants

</p>
<p>" under the most poignant distress, crouched under the
</p>
<p>" most odious subjugation, and, to complete the atrocities
</p>
<p>" of despotism, they are no longer permitted to complain.
</p>
<p>" ... .At any rate, if our country is doomed to perish
</p>
<p>" in those of her children who are implicated in this

</p>
<p>But when Babeuf spoke with affection of the Con
</p>
<p>stitution of 1793  when he began to enumerate the
</p>
<p>violences by which that Constitution had been torn from
</p>
<p>262 BABEUF S CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>the people, the national accusers commenced a torrent
</p>
<p>of invectives against the accused, and pretended that
</p>
<p>they were still conspiring against the Government. So
</p>
<p>Babeuf was immediately condemned to silence again.
</p>
<p>Buonarroti also undertook to justify this document.*
</p>
<p>He said that the body it created had no other object
</p>
<p>than that of propagating democratic doctrines ; he main
</p>
<p>tained that even had this body prepared legislative
</p>
<p>draughts of measures to be submitted to the people,
</p>
<p>whose discontent was notorious, and every moment ex
</p>
<p>pected to explode, it would have done no more than an
</p>
<p>act of prudence, in nowise contrary to the laws ; and
</p>
<p>then assuming the hypothesis, that the. Secret Directory
</p>
<p>might have wished to provoke the people to examine the
</p>
<p>form of Government, he demonstrated that such provoca
</p>
<p>tion is the right of every citizen in every country ruled
</p>
<p>by a constitution, which, like that of the Year III., ac
</p>
<p>knowledges that the sovereignty resides in the universality
</p>
<p>of the citizens.
</p>
<p>At a later stage of the proceedings Babeuf adroitly
</p>
<p>recurred to this object, and by the help of some prefatory
</p>
<p>remarks, suited to bespeak the ear of the Court, he was
</p>
<p>enabled to speak aloud  " to rouse the real people from
</p>
<p>" their slumber  to provoke the reign of happiness, the
</p>
<p>" reign of equality and liberty, abundance for all, liberty
</p>
<p>" for all, the prosperity of all  behold the aspirations of
</p>
<p>" those pretended insurrectionists, who have been painted
</p>
<p>" in such horrifying colours to the eyes of all France."
</p>
<p>Touching afterwards on the means, he made it appear
</p>
<p>that in reality they reduced themselves to the operating
</p>
<p>a revolution in opinion, a general movement of mind,
</p>
<p>the effects of which, he thought, had been exaggerated
</p>
<p>by the authors of the Act creating the Insurrectional
</p>
<p>Directory. " For, added he, very judiciously, " it is but
</p>
<p>" too evident, that a moral revolution being the necessary

</p>
<p>He did more; he proved that when the people is
</p>
<p>oppressed, insurrection, even partial insurrection, is just
</p>
<p>and necessary ; and supporting his argument by the
</p>
<p>authority of Mably, he completely refuted the lethargic
</p>
<p>doctrine of the national accusers, who said  " Insurrection
</p>
<p>" is legitimate only when sanctioned by the universal
</p>
<p>" participation of the citizens," as much as to say  never !
</p>
<p>Twice was Babeuf asked to name his accomplices,
</p>
<p>and twice did he reject the proposal with horror. With
</p>
<p>the like indignation did he scout the system of falsehood
</p>
<p>by which some of the accused and an advocate wished
</p>
<p>to defend themselves, by attributing the conception of
</p>
<p>the conspiracy to the Government, and by representing
</p>
<p>the agents of authority as having provoked its most dan
</p>
<p>gerous acts. For example, when the Court was canvassing
</p>
<p>the Insurrectional Act, on the subject of which Ricord
</p>
<p>had exclaimed  " it is Grisel himself who has drawn it
</p>
<p>up"  " No," replied Babeuf sternly, " he has not drawn
</p>
<p>" it up ; it is not a document that should make its
</p>
<p>" author blush, and Grisel is too great a miscreant to
</p>
<p>" have drawn up such an Act."
</p>
<p>All the documentary proofs were handed in by the
</p>
<p>accusers in the exact order in which they had really been
</p>
<p>framed, and when tied together as a parcel in their
</p>
<p>consecutive form, they offered an easy clue, of which the
</p>
<p>accusers naturally availed themselves, to deduce the
</p>
<p>veritable history of the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Conformably to their previously co-arranged plan of
</p>
<p>denying the conspiracy, the accused made great efforts
</p>
<p>to sever the connecting chain of documentary evidence,

<p>of which the accusers had shown the true and consecu
</p>
<p>tive order. This they attempted to do by referring their
</p>
<p>respective papers to isolated causes, to fortuitous circum
</p>
<p>stances, and to distinct epochs. In analysing those
</p>
<p>papers, they let no opportunity escape of avowing their

<p>democratic principles, of justifying them, and of showing

<p>that the Constitution which then ruled France was not

<p>the one which the French nation had given itself. Thus,
</p>
<p>in explaining the draught of an address to the soldiers
</p>
<p>of which he was the author (see justificative pieces),
</p>
<p>Buonarroti described why he had actively served the
</p>
<p>French Revolution ; developed, in spite of the interrup
</p>
<p>tions of the Court, his reasons for defending the Consti
</p>
<p>tution of 1793 ; accused the Government of usurpation
</p>
<p>and tyranny, and pronounced an eulogium of the de
</p>
<p>signs and acts of the Revolutionary Government. " The
</p>
<p>' oath,'' cried he, " which I took to defend the code
</p>
<p>" unanimously sanctioned by an immense people in the
</p>
<p>" days of its union and glory, cannot be effaced from
</p>
<p>" my heart; and the fidelity which even slaves have

<p>" been seen to preserve towards their masters, I have
</p>
<p>" preserved to a magnanimous people,' which generously
</p>
<p>" received me in its bosom, and adopted me, in its days
</p>
<p>" of liberty, as a constituent part of its solemn will."
</p>
<p>It was not without intense emotion and excitement
</p>
<p>that a multitude of citizens, belonging to Vendome and
</p>
<p>its environs, attended every day the sittings of the High
</p>
<p>Court. Those vehement attacks so often reiterated
</p>
<p>against the Government ; those pressing argumentations
</p>
<p>from which the accusers seldom emerged victorious ; the
</p>
<p>lively attachment of the prisoners to the rights and in
</p>
<p>terests of the people, and their bold and frank defence
</p>
<p>of the most popular events of the Revolution ; those
</p>
<p>noble youths who, called from their irons to give evidence
</p>
<p>for the Government, not only refused to speak, but
</p>
<p>absolutely rendered homage to the men they were dragged
</p>
<p>to appear against ; those devoted families who travelled
</p>
<p>from Paris to witness the struggle whose issue they
</p>
<p>awaited with trembling ;  these, and the like circum
</p>
<p>stances, had inspired the spectators with an ardent
</p>
<p>interest in behalf of the accused, an interest which was

<p>every day augmented by the articles of a journal printed

<p>in the place, and by the conversations of the inhabitants,
</p>
<p>who were almost exclusively occupied with what was
</p>
<p>passing in the Court.
</p>
<p>To these friendly dispositions was soon superadded the
</p>
<p>desire to rescue the most implicated of the accused from
</p>
<p>the dangers that menaced them. On one side, secret
</p>
<p>attempts were made to induce a part of the soldiers who

<p>BABEUF S CONSPIRACY, 265
</p>
<p>guarded them to make an insurrection in their favour ;
</p>
<p>they did not succeed. On the other hand, it was in
</p>
<p>contemplation to favour a clandestine escape. By the
</p>
<p>help of some instruments, furtively introduced into the
</p>
<p>prison, the accused in a few days opened a large breach
</p>
<p>in the walls, through which those most implicated were
</p>
<p>on the point of escaping from their executioners, when the
</p>
<p>inconsiderate conduct of some of the prisoners alarmed
</p>
<p>the vigilance of the guards, and thus all hopes of flight ,

<p>vanished. About thirty heads were devoted to  ,-, j-

</p>
<p>numerous, and so conclusive, that it was most easy for
</p>
<p>them to establish the truth of the information, and to
</p>
<p>prove the reality of the conspiracy. They were not
</p>
<p>equally successful in demonstrating fts criminality.
</p>
<p>The accused had repeatedly maintained that, even
</p>
<p>supposing there had been a conspiracy, there was nothing
</p>
<p>criminal in it, seeing that the Constitution, against which it
</p>
<p>was directed, being subversive of the sovereignty of the
</p>
<p>people, and not having been accepted by the people, was,
</p>
<p>therefore, not the veritable law. To this paramount
</p>
<p>and decisive point the accusers made no reply, but
</p>
<p>taking their stand upon the fact, they affected to treat
</p>
<p>as irrelevant to the question, the legitimacy of intention.
</p>
<p>Throwing aside the gravest argument of the accused,
</p>
<p>they amused themselves with combatting those which
</p>
<p>appeared weakest, and, above all, they aimed at

<p>not fail to speak of it; he expounded his democratic

<p>opinions on that point, and justified them by reason  by

<p>depicting the evils entailed upon society through the con

<p>had propagated the same doctrine. " Private pro-

</p>
<p>request of the foreman of the jury, added some others,
</p>
<p>touching the provocations (written or verbal) to re-establish
</p>
<p>the Constitution of 1793. This addition produced in
</p>
<p>the terms of the indictment a change the more illegal,
</p>
<p>inasmuch as it all at once submitted to the examination
</p>
<p>of the jurors papers, on which the parties had not been
</p>
<p>permitted to explain themselves.* Some of the accused
</p>
<p>complained loudly of this, but, notwithstanding that they
</p>
<p>were, pro tanto, supported by the opinion of the national
</p>
<p>accuser, the Court took no notice of their complaints.

</p>
<p>against the manner in which the question of intention
</p>
<p>was put, and in which an odious partiality was visible.
</p>
<p>The law ordered, on pain of rendering null and void,
</p>
<p>that in all cases the jury, after having declared the fact
</p>
<p>proven, and the accused party convicted, should add,- 
</p>
<p>" I am, or I am not, of opinion that he had committed
</p>
<p>such act maliciously, and with design." It was espe
</p>
<p>cially on maintaining the adverb maliciously that the
</p>
<p>accused insisted, because they saw in it, as it were, an
</p>
<p>invitation to the Jury to examine the legitimacy of the
</p>
<p>motives by which they had hypothetically justified the
</p>
<p>conspiracy. On the question of intention, it was, that
</p>
<p>the accused expressed themselves thus in addressing the
</p>
<p>jurors :  " Descend into your own hearts; you will there
</p>
<p>" find a silent monitor to whisper you  ' These men,
</p>
<p>' after all, only meditated on the happiness of their

</p>
<p>" though our arguments were true, the jurors could
</p>
<p>" take no account of tlie motives which might have
</p>
<p>" determined the accused, nor see in their intentions
</p>
<p>' other than the design to subvert the Constitution of
</p>
<p>" the Year III. (1795). If you admit this novel pre-
</p>
<p>" tention, then, there is no longer in France either jury
</p>
<p>" or country. In the first place, it is not to the over-
</p>
<p>' throw of the actual Constitution, but to that of legiti-
</p>
<p>" mate authority, that the jurors ought to turn their
</p>
<p>'" attention; for could they declare a man guilty who,
</p>
<p>" in acting against the Government de facto, was im-
</p>
<p>" pelled by the conviction that he was acting in favour
</p>
<p>" of the Government dejure, and of the veritable law
</p>
<p>" of the country ? What, in that case, would become
</p>
<p>" of the internal feeling of good or evil, which renders
</p>
<p>" the institution of jurors so invaluable in the estimation
</p>
<p>" of pure consciences ? To what a nullity you would
</p>
<p>" reduce the care which the law has taken of reconciling
</p>
<p>" (by questions touching intention and motive) the con-
</p>
<p>" tradictions so frequently observable between the pre-
</p>
<p>" cepts of natural law and those of the actual law ! To
</p>
<p>" what a pass you would bring the supreme law of the
</p>
<p>" interest of the people, which enjoins its delegates to
</p>
<p>" reckon love of country, and devotion to its welfare, as
</p>
<p>" a principal circumstance in judging the hearts of
</p>
<p>" accused persons."
</p>
<p>Some of the jurors joined the accused in demanding
</p>
<p>that the questions touching intention might be put ac
</p>
<p>cording to the formula prescribed by the law ; they
</p>
<p>asked in vain. The High Court persisting in its course,

<p>limited the questions within the following terms : 
</p>
<p>" Has the accused conspired, or provoked with the
</p>
<p>" intention of conspiring, or of provoking ?" Thus
</p>
<p>was interdicted all examination touching the morality of
</p>
<p>the act.
</p>
<p>There were sixteen jurors ; four were Declaration of

<p>constantly favourable to the accused. Gauthier Biauzat,
</p>
<p>whom we name, because we know he has ceased to live,
</p>
<p>was of the number. He remained throughout faithful to
</p>
<p>the people ; and, had it depended on him, there would
</p>
<p>have been none condemned. All the questions, however,
</p>
<p>relative to the conspiracy were resolved negatively. But.
</p>
<p>unfortunately, thirteen jurors pronounced that there had
</p>
<p>been provocations, verbal and written, to re-establish the
</p>
<p>Constitution of 1793, and that Babeuf, Darthe, Buonar
</p>
<p>roti, Germain, Cazin, Moroy, Blondeau, Meneissier, and
</p>
<p>Bouin, had participated in it ; the two first without

<p>palliating circumstances, all the others with these cir

<p>cumstances. From day-break in the morning of the

<p>7th Prairial of the Year V., the rolling of drums, the

</p>
<p>gloomy silence. A numerous and uneasy multitude
</p>
<p>filled the Court, of which all the avenues were guarded
</p>
<p>by a strong military force. The chief of the jury having
</p>
<p>pronounced the fatal verdict, which he did with a tre
</p>
<p>mulous voice, the accusers followed, demanding sen

<p>tence of death against Babeuf and Darthe, and of
</p>
<p>deportation against the rest.
</p>
<p>A last attempt was made to arrest judgment. One
</p>

<p>tribunal to pronounce a general acquittal, on the ground
</p>
<p>that the law of the 27th Germinal, the application of

<p>which had been just required by the national accusers,
</p>
<p>being prohibitive of the liberty of the press, had ceased

<p>to be in force, by virtue of an article of the Constitution,

<p>purporting that every law of this description should have
</p>
<p>effect during only one year at most. The tribunal paid

<p>no attention to it, but said to Babeuf and Darthe

<p>At that moment a great tumult is Babeuf and

</p>
<p>people; a general movement is made by the spectators,
</p>
<p>which is instantly suppressed by a hundred bayonets
</p>
<p>directed against them. The gendarmes seize those sen
</p>
<p>tenced to transportation, menace them with their sabres,
</p>
<p>and drag them, along with their dying companions,
</p>
<p>away from the public view. But the weakness of their
</p>
<p>poignards, which broke in the attempt, prevented Babeuf
</p>
<p>and Darthe from accomplishing their self-destruction.
</p>
<p>They passed a cruel night in consequence of the wounds
</p>
<p>they inflicted on themselves ; the blade of the weapon
</p>
<p>remained buried in Babeuf's wound, close to his heart.
</p>
<p>Then courage never belied itself; and Bloody execu-
</p>
<p>strong in conscience they marched reso- tion-
</p>
<p>lutely to the scaffold, as to a triumph. Immediately
</p>
<p>before receiving the stroke of death, Babeuf spoke of
</p>
<p>his love for the people, to whom he recommended his
</p>
<p>family. A general mourning prevailed in Vendome
</p>
<p>when those generous defenders of equahty lost their
</p>
<p>fives. Their mutilated bodies, which the barbarians had

<p>caused to be flung into a ditch, were piously interred by

<p>the neighbouring country people.

<p>injustice. This unfortunate old man, who, by the in

<p>lution and of justice, had hardly escaped a bloody pro
</p>
<p>scription, when a fresh pretext was seized to involve him
</p>
<p>in another. Though he had no knowledge whatever of
</p>
<p>the conspiracy, and though not even suspected, he was
</p>
<p>arrested, dragged, through a thousand dangers, from
</p>
<p>Toulouse to Paris, put in accusation, and transferred to
</p>
<p>Vendome. In the course of the debates, he tried in vain
</p>
<p>to justify his conduct ; he was silenced. Being, how-
</p>

</p>
<p>ever, obliged to acquit him, he was ordered to be de
</p>
<p>tained in prison, on the alleged ground that there was a
</p>
<p>decree of the Convention authorizing his deportation.
</p>
<p>Will it be believed ? This decree had been revoked,
</p>
<p>and no longer existed ! It was thus, by an error of fact
</p>
<p>so easy to rectify, that the members of the first tribunal
</p>
<p>of the Republic  a tribunal to which a law had attri
</p>
<p>buted infallibility  arbitrarily, and without interrogating
</p>
<p>their victim, inflicted a most severe punishment, which

</p>
<p>times receiving the most affecting marks of affection and
</p>
<p>respect. At Falaise, at Caen, and at Valogne, they
</p>
<p>encountered imminent dangers ; but they were received
</p>
<p>with friendship and honour at Mellereau, at Argertan,
</p>
<p>and at Saint-L6. In this latter city the mayor, at the
</p>
<p>head of the municipal body, complimented and embraced
</p>
<p>them, calling them, our unfortunate brethren. " You
</p>

<p>indicative of the state of opinion, and of the nature of the efforts

<p>affairs, abandoned the Revolution to the monied classes. In re
</p>
<p>ference to this portion of French history, Mignet observes : 
</p>
<p>" Some time afterwards, Babeuf and his accomplices, amongst
</p>
<p>whom were Amar, Vadier, and Darthe, the old Secretary of Joseph
</p>
<p>Lebon, were brought to trial before the High Court of Venddme.
</p>
<p>They none of them belied their character ; they spoke like men
</p>
<p>who were neither afraid to avow their designs nor to die for their
</p>
<p>cause. At the beginning and ending of each examination, they
</p>
<p>hummed the air of the Marseillaise. This ancient song of victory,
</p>
<p>joined with their confident demeanour, struck the spectators with
</p>
<p>astonishment, and seemed to render them still formidable. Their
</p>
<p>wives having followed them before the tribunal, Babeuf, in finish
</p>
<p>ing his defence, turned towards them, and said, ' They might
</p>
<p>follow them to the very place of execution, for their punishment
</p>
<p>could not make them blush.' Babeuf and Darth6 were condemned
</p>
<p>to death, and they both, on hearing their sentence, stabbed them
</p>
<p>selves with their daggers. Babeuf was the last chief of the old
</p>
<p>commune, and of the Committee of Public Safety, which had been
</p>
<p>divided before July (Thermidor), but had afterwards united. The
</p>
<p>final dispersion of this party, which had been diminishing more
</p>
<p>and more every day, may be dated from this period. Under the
</p>
<p>re-action it remained united, and under Babeuf presented a
</p>
<p>formidable association. From that time Democrats still existed,

</p>
<p>THE FRENCH CONSTITUTION.
</p>
<p>ADOPTEn BY
</p>
<p>THE NATIONAL CONVENTION.
</p>
<p>Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.
</p>
<p>The French people, convinced that the forgetfulness
</p>
<p>and contempt of the natural rights of man, are the sole
</p>
<p>causes of the calamities of the world, has resolved to lay
</p>
<p>open, in a solemn declaration, those sacred and inalien
</p>
<p>able rights, to the end that all the citizens being always
</p>
<p>able to compare the acts of the Government with the
</p>
<p>design of all social institutions, may never suffer them
</p>
<p>selves to be oppressed and abused by tyranny ; and that
</p>
<p>the people may have perpetually before its eyes the bases
</p>
<p>of its liberty and its happiness, the magistrate the rule
</p>
<p>of his duties, and the legislator the object of his mis
</p>
<p>sion. In consequence it proclaims, in presence of the Su
</p>
<p>preme Being, the following declaration of the rights of
</p>
<p>man and of the citizen : 
</p>
<p>Art. 1 . The end of society is general happiness
</p>
<p>Government is instituted for the purpose of guarantee
</p>
<p>ing to man the enjoyment of his natural and impre
</p>
<p>scriptible rights.
</p>
<p>2. Those rights are equality, liberty, safety, and pro
</p>
<p>perty. 3. All men are equal by nature and in the eye of the
</p>
<p>law. 4. The law is the free and solemn expression of the

<p>general will; it is the same for all, either in protecting
</p>
<p>280 babeuf's CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>or in punishing : it can ordain only that which is just
</p>
<p>and useful to society.
</p>
<p>5. Every citizen is equally admissible to public em
</p>
<p>ployments. Free people, in their elections, know no
</p>
<p>other motives of preference, than virtue and talents.
</p>
<p>6. Liberty^ is the power which belongs to a man of
</p>
<p>doing all thatwhich does not injure the rights of another :
</p>
<p>it has nature for its origin, justice for its rule, and the
</p>
<p>law for its protection : its moral bounds are defined in
</p>
<p>this maxim, 
</p>
<p>Do not to another that which thou dost not wish he.
</p>
<p>he should do unto thee.
</p>
<p>7. The right of manifesting thoughts and opinions,
</p>
<p>either by the press or by any other manner, the right of
</p>
<p>assembling peaceably, and the free exercise of modes of
</p>
<p>worship, cannot be forbidden.
</p>
<p>The necessity of declaring these rights supposes either
</p>
<p>the presence or the remembrance of recent despotism.
</p>
<p>8. Safety consists in the protection granted by society
</p>
<p>to each of its members for the preservation of his person,
</p>
<p>of his rights, and of his property.
</p>
<p>9. The law ought to protect public and individual
</p>
<p>liberty from the oppression of those who govern.
</p>
<p>10. No one ought to be accused, arrested, or de
</p>
<p>tained otherwise than in the cases determined by the
</p>
<p>law, and according to the forms wliich it prescribes :
</p>
<p>every citizen summoned or seized by the authority of
</p>
<p>the law ought instantly to obey ; by resistance he ren
</p>
<p>ders himself culpable.
</p>
<p>1 1 . Every act exercised against a man who has not
</p>
<p>offended against the law, and exercised without the
</p>
<p>forms prescribed by the law, is arbitrary and tyrannical :
</p>
<p>the person against whom it is wished to be exercised by
</p>
<p>violence has the right of resisting it by force.

</p>
<p>14. No one ought to be judged and punished, till
</p>
<p>after having been heard or legally summoned, and but
</p>
<p>in virtue of a law promulgated before the commission of
</p>
<p>the crime: the law which punishes crimes committed
</p>
<p>before its existence is a tyranny; a retroactive effect
</p>
<p>given to the law is a crime.
</p>
<p>15. The law ought to decree only punishments strictly
</p>
<p>and evidently necessary : punishments ought to be pro
</p>
<p>portioned to crimes, and useful to society.
</p>
<p>16. The right of property is that which belongs to
</p>
<p>every citizen of disposing, at his pleasure, of his goods,
</p>
<p>of his revenues, and of the produce of his labour and
</p>
<p>industry. 17. No kind of labour, of culture, or commerce, can
</p>
<p>be forbidden to the industry of citizens.
</p>
<p>18. Every man may engage his services and his time,
</p>
<p>but he can neither sell himself nor be sold. His person
</p>
<p>is not an alienable property. The law does not acknow
</p>
<p>ledge the state of servitude ; there can exist only an
</p>
<p>engagement of attentions and recompenses between the
</p>
<p>man who labours and the man who employs him.
</p>
<p>19. No one can be deprived of the least part of his
</p>
<p>property without his consent, except when the public
</p>
<p>necessity, legally verified, requires it, and under the
</p>
<p>condition of a just and previous indemnity.
</p>
<p>20. No contribution can be established but for general
</p>
<p>utility. All the citizens have a right of concurring in
</p>
<p>the estabhshment of contributions, in watching over
</p>
<p>then- employ, and in causing an account of them to be
</p>
<p>rendered. 21. Public succours are a sacred debt. Society owes
</p>
<p>subsistence to unfortunate citizens, either by procuring
</p>
<p>them labour, or by assuring the means of existence to
</p>
<p>those who are not in a state to labour.
</p>
<p>22. Instruction is what all have need of. Society
</p>
<p>ought to favour with all its power the progress of public
</p>
<p>reason, and put instruction within the reach of all the

<p>citizens. 23. The social guarantee consists in the action of all
</p>
<p>for the purpose of assuring to each the enjoyment and
</p>
<p>preservation of his rights: this guarantee rests on the
</p>
<p>national sovereignty.
</p>
<p>282 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>24. It cannot exist, if the limits of the public func
</p>
<p>tions are not clearly determined by law, and if the re
</p>
<p>sponsibility of all the functionaries is not assured.
</p>
<p>25. The sovereignty resides in the people. It is one
</p>
<p>and indivisible, imprescriptible, and inalienable.
</p>
<p>26. No portion of, the people can exercise the power
</p>
<p>of the entire people ; but every section of the sovereign
</p>
<p>assembled ought to enjoy, with an entire liberty, the
</p>
<p>right of expressing its will.
</p>
<p>27. All individuals usurping the sovereignty should be
</p>
<p>immediately put to death by free men.
</p>
<p>28. A people has always the right of revising, of re
</p>
<p>forming, and of changing its constitution. One genera
</p>
<p>tion cannot subject future generations to its laws.
</p>
<p>29. Every citizen has an equal right to concur to the
</p>
<p>formation of the law, and to the nomination of his de
</p>
<p>legates, or of his agents.
</p>
<p>30. The public functions are in an essential manner
</p>
<p>temporary : they cannot be considered either as distinc
</p>
<p>tions or as recompenses, but as duties.
</p>
<p>31. The crimes of the delegates of the people ought
</p>
<p>never to be unpunished. No one has the right of pre
</p>
<p>tending that he is more inviolable than other citizens.
</p>
<p>32. The right of presenting petitions to the depositaries
</p>
<p>of the public authority cannot in any case be forbidden,
</p>
<p>suspended, or limited.
</p>
<p>33. Resistance to oppression is the consequence of
</p>
<p>the other rights of man.
</p>
<p>34. There is oppression against the social body when
</p>
<p>one alone of its members is oppressed. There is op
</p>
<p>pression against every member when the social body is
</p>
<p>oppressed. 35. When government violates the rights of the

<p>person ; and likewise every foreigner who shall be

<p>judged by the legislative body to have merited well of
</p>
<p>humanity, is admitted to the exercise of the rights of a
</p>
<p>French citizen.
</p>
<p>5. The exercise of the rights of a citizen is lost by

<p>naturalization in a foreign country, by the acceptance of

<p>functions or favours from a government not originating
</p>
<p>from the people, and by condemnation to corporal and

</p>

<p>Primary Assemblies.
</p>
<p>1 1 . The primary assemblies are composed of citizens
</p>
<p>domiciliated during six months in each canton.
</p>
<p>12. They are composed of two hundred citizens at
</p>
<p>least, of six hundred at most, called to vote.
</p>
<p>13. They are constituted by the nomination of a pre

<p>sident, of secretaries, and of scrutators.

<p>14. Their police belongs to them.
</p>
<p>15. No person can appear there in arms:

<p>by no.

<p>the preference, either to be balloted or elected. In case
</p>
<p>of an equality of age, it is decided by lot.
</p>
<p>28. Every Frenchmen exercising the rights of a citizen
</p>
<p>is eligible in the extent of the Republic.

<p>29. Every deputy belongs to the whole nation.

<p>meddle in its own.

</p>
<p>THE TRUTH TO THE PEOPLE,
</p>
<p>BY THE PATRIOTS OF 89
</p>
<p>Of the \AthJuly, \0th August, and\3th Vendemiaire.
</p>
<p>People ! you whom they caress or threaten  whom
</p>
<p>they exalt or vilify, as may suit the ambitious views of those
</p>
<p>men who speak of your rights only to trample them under
</p>
<p>foot  of your sovereignty only to usurp it  listen to great
</p>
<p>truths ! learn the cause of all the calamities which you
</p>
<p>have been made to endure, from the 9th Thermidor of the
</p>
<p>Year II., up to Vendemiaire of the Year IV.
</p>
<p>Certain abuses  a few arbitrary acts inseparable from
</p>
<p>a great revolution  had impressed some blemishes on
</p>
<p>the sreat and glorious events of the four first years of
</p>
<p>the Revolution. To correct those abuses  to put an end
</p>
<p>to all provisional government  to give the people a con
</p>
<p>stitution which would guarantee its rights and sovereignty
</p>
<p> to snatch power from hands that abused it  to strip
</p>
<p>tyranny of all hopes of raising its hideous head  behold
</p>
<p>what the Revolution of the 9th Thermidor would have
</p>
<p>operated for you, if the interest of the people  if general
</p>
<p>happiness  had been the object of that event. But its
</p>
<p>results have been most disastrous, because it was the work
</p>
<p>of vice, of division, of ambition, and of vengeance ; it
</p>
<p>turned every thing to the advantage of royalism; it has
</p>
<p>ended by dragging into one common precipice the pure
</p>
<p>and courageous Republicans, and the false ones employed
</p>
<p>to bring it about. From that moment calumny has never
</p>
<p>ceased to distil its poison. 'Every friend of the people 
</p>
<p>every founder of liberty  was qualified and treated
</p>
<p>as knave, miscreant, terrorist, and blood-drinker These
</p>
<p>denominations were rendered synonymous with Repub
</p>

</p>
<p>polluted the tribune of the senate with them. Thence

</p>
<p>to the golden million, which exclusively called itself
</p>
<p>sovereign ; pity had all her tears for counter-revolution
</p>
<p>ists, who represented themselves as being all victims of
</p>
<p>terror ; the prison doors were unlocked to them, and their
</p>
<p>places speedily supplied by Republicans, under the name
</p>
<p>Terrorists ; and the latter were expelled from all military
</p>
<p>and civil posts, to be succeeded by returned emigrants,
</p>
<p>by nobles, by non-juring priests, who had all become
</p>
<p>patriots par excellence. Forthwith our armies were dis
</p>
<p>organised, treasons burst forth, our arsenals, which a short
</p>
<p>time before abounded in every thing, were emptied, our
</p>
<p>fleets beaten were abandoned to the enemy, and our
</p>
<p>marine annihilated. It then became necessary to our
</p>
<p>tyrants to proscribe the popular surveillance, to stifle public
</p>
<p>remonstrances (imprescriptible rights of a free people) ;
</p>
<p>accordingly did our new masters hastsn to destroy our
</p>
<p>popular societies, which had been the advanced sentinels
</p>
<p>of the Revolution, and the terror of Pitt and Cobourg,
</p>
<p>because they were focuses of public instruction, whence
</p>
<p>issued sparks that electrified all hearts, and fed the
</p>
<p>sacred enthusiasm of liberty ; because they opposed a
</p>
<p>formidable rampart to ambition and intrigue ; because,
</p>
<p>in short, they were so many Pharoses or beacon-lights,
</p>
<p>warning our state-pilots of the rocks which endangered
</p>
<p>the vessel of liberty.
</p>
<p>And, heavens ! what means resorted to, to operate
</p>
<p>and consolidate this counter-revolution !  what liberticidal
</p>
<p>decrees wrested from the Convention by the faction of
</p>
<p>the foreigner !  what hordes of emigrants struck cut
</p>
<p>from the proscription lists, and restored to honour, under
</p>
<p>the qualification of cultivators and workmen !  what
</p>
<p>bands of refractory priests tolerated, and licensed to
</p>
<p>fanatieize the multitude! The property of condemned
</p>
<p>Royalists, which offered a solid mortgage to the as
</p>
<p>signats, was restored to their kinsfolk, as guilty as them

<p>Yes !  no doubt, subsistence was provided for the

<p>are not altogether lost to us, since they have divested of

<p>many crimes ; since they have restored to their families

<p>publicity, evidence, and truth. The patriots, confiding

<p>in its good faith, repaired in crowds to join them; the

<p>GENERAL HAPPINESS.
</p>
<p>Creation of an Insurrectional Directory.
</p>
<p>The Democrats of France, grievously affected, pro
</p>
<p>foundly indignant, justly revolted at the unheard-of state
</p>
<p>of misery and oppression of which their unhappy country
</p>
<p>presents the spectacle;
</p>
<p>Ardently remembering that when a Democratic Con
</p>
<p>stitution was given to the people, and by it accepted,
</p>
<p>the preservation of that Constitution was placed under
</p>
<p>the safeguard of all the virtues ;
</p>
<p>Considering, therefore, that to the purest, most
</p>
<p>courageous virtues, belongs the initiative of undertaking
</p>
<p>to avenge the people, whenever, as now, its rights are
</p>
<p>usurped, its liberty ravished, and even its existence
</p>
<p>compromised ;
</p>
<p>Believing that the reproach is an unjust one which
</p>
<p>accuses the people of cowardice, and that if the people
</p>
<p>has hitherto postponed its justice, it was only for want
</p>
<p>of proper guides to lead them on ;
</p>
<p>Recognizing that the overflowing measure of the
</p>
<p>crimes of an usurped authority has ripened the inclina
</p>
<p>tions of every virtuous soul, in favour of a revolutionary
</p>
<p>explosion, to that degree of maturity, that in order to
</p>
<p>render it beneficial  that to put its conductors in a train
</p>
<p>to ensure success, it will probably be necessary to mode
</p>
<p>rate rather than accelerate the impetuous burst of free
</p>
<p>dom,  have resolved as follows : 
</p>
<p>Art. 1. They constitute themselves, from this moment,
</p>
<p>an Insurrectional Directory, under the name of the
</p>
<p>" Secret Directory of Public Safety." In this capacity
</p>
<p>they assume the initiative of all movements intended to
</p>
<p>lead the people to the recovery of its sovereignty.

<p>Organization of Principal Agents to the Number of
</p>
<p>Twelve, and of Intermediary Agents.  Principal
</p>
<p>Functions of each Class.
</p>
<p>The Secret Directory of Public Safety has resolved as
</p>
<p>follows : 
</p>
<p>Art. 1 . There shall be twelve principal revolutionary
</p>
<p>agents  one for each arrondissement of the commune ot
</p>
<p>Paris. 2. Each of these is charged to organize, in his arron
</p>
<p>dissement, one or more unions of patriots; to foster and
</p>
<p>direct the public mind in those unions by the reading of
</p>
<p>popular journals, and by discussions on the rights of the
</p>
<p>people, and respecting its present situation.
</p>
<p>3. These agents shall take note of the daily thermo
</p>
<p>meter of public opinion. They shall render account in
</p>
<p>those notes of the dispositions, more or less favourable,
</p>
<p>of the patriots ; they shall signify the individuals they
</p>
<p>may observe most capable of seconding the progress of
</p>
<p>the movement designed to be brought about ; they shall
</p>
<p>indicate the description of employment, or revolutionary
</p>
<p>enterprise, to which they may suppose each of these
</p>
<p>individuals suited. They shall, in like manner, take note

</p>
<p>sinuate themselves into the meetings ; and they shall,

<p>sition which the latter may offer to the development of
</p>
<p>energy, or to the inspiration of sound principles and

<p>regenerating ideas.

</p>
<p>communications between the principal agents and the
</p>
<p>Secret Directory.
</p>
<p>5. To those agents only shall the twelve principal .
</p>
<p>agents commit the notes of their daily observations.
</p>
<p>6. The intermediary agents shall apply successively
</p>
<p>for these notes every day, or every second day, to each
</p>
<p>of the principal agents, at their residences, if necessary.

<p>Secret Directory, and the following instruction, shall be

<p>PIECE, No. VI.

<p>Primary Instruction of the Secret Directory, addressed
</p>
<p>to each of the Principal Revolutionary Agents.
</p>
<p>Citizens!  It is not in times of crisis as in ordinary
</p>
<p>times. When the people enjoys its rights, when the
</p>
<p>principles of liberty triumph, no one has a right to as
</p>
<p>sume authority over others, without their concurrence;
</p>
<p>nobody can enterprise measures relating to the general
</p>
<p>interest without consulting the whole people, and without
</p>
<p>obtaining its assent. The reason is, that then the best !
</p>
<p>social order reigns, and the best social order is perpe
</p>
<p>tuated only by the rigid maintenance of principles. The j
</p>
<p>man who, in such a state of things, should assume any
</p>
<p>T title whatever for erecting himself (without any conces
</p>
<p>sion made to him) into a pubhc magistrate, under pre
</p>
<p>tence of wishing to ameliorate the condition of his
</p>
<p>iellow-citizens, would be a usurper, even on the sup
</p>
<p>position that his ultimate intentions were perfectly
</p>
<p>upright The reason of this too is plain it is, that

<p>where the people is free, and may be consulted, it is not
</p>
<p>babeuf's CONSPIRACY. 305
</p>
<p>to be presumed that others can judge better of its in
</p>
<p>terests than the people itself can.
</p>
<p>The case is different when a people is in chains  when
</p>
<p>tyranny has placed it in a state of impotence to emit its
</p>
<p>will on all that concerns it; when a fortiori, it has be
</p>
<p>come impracticable for the people to direct measures of
</p>
<p>repression against its tyrants ; when it has been rendered
</p>
<p>incapable of wresting from them the usurped power, of
</p>
<p>which they take advantage, to make it suffer and lan
</p>
<p>guish in despair, and to subjugate it more and more every
</p>
<p>day, till it reaches a limit beyond all calculation.
</p>
<p>It becomes, then, just  it becomes necessary that the
</p>
<p>most intrepid  men most capable of devoting themselves
</p>
<p> men endowed with the greatest amount of energy, fire,
</p>
<p>and force  with those generous virtues, under the safe
</p>
<p>guard of which has been deposited the preservation of
</p>
<p>a popular Constitution, which all Frenchmen, having
</p>
<p>the true spirit of freemen, have never lost sight of  it is
</p>
<p>then just and necessary that such men, being moreover
</p>
<p>convinced that the inspiration of their own hearts, or that
</p>
<p>of liberty itself (which makes them more forcibly  more
</p>
<p>particularv hear its voice), is a sufficient authority to
</p>
<p>them to enterprize every thing  it is just and necessary
</p>
<p>that such men should invest themselves with the dictator
</p>
<p>ship of insurrection  that they should assume the initia
</p>
<p>tive  that they should arrogate the glorious title of
</p>
<p>" conspirators for liberty"  in a word, that they should
</p>
<p>erect themselves into magistrates to save their fellow-
</p>
<p>citizens. Such are the motives which have appeared to us to
</p>
<p>justify our resolution, and to give it a character of
</p>
<p>grandeur and magnanimity. Having thus satisfied our
</p>
<p>selves that our self-conferred' mission is eminently legiti
</p>
<p>mate, since the circumstances which render it indispensable
</p>
<p>for the salvation of liberty, do not admit of its transmission

</p>
<p>guished this very encouraging truth  that the accusation
</p>
<p>of cowardly apathy, urged against the people, is sheer
</p>
<p>blasphemy, and that from the general impatience it
</p>
<p>manifests to burst a yoke really abhorrent to it, we may
</p>
<p>readily see, that if, up to this time, it has done nothing
</p>
<p>to break that yoke, we must attribute the circumstance
</p>
<p>306 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>to the fact, that it has hitherto seen itself without guides;
</p>
<p>and we have remarked, that it is with the deepest regret
</p>
<p>it postpones the repression of the crimes accumulated on
</p>
<p>its head. Every thing has announced to us what it
</p>
<p>would be capable of doing, if it perceived at its head
</p>
<p>leaders worthy of its confidence.
</p>
<p>Animated by such dispositions, we have been imme
</p>
<p>diately led to turn our regards to the men most capable
</p>
<p>of seconding us in our glorious enterprize. It is you,
</p>
<p>citizens, who, by a long career of republican conduct, by
</p>
<p>multiplied acts of pure civism manifested in every stage
</p>
<p>of the Revolution, by the terrible proofs you have given of
</p>
<p>your patriotism in times when everything virtuous and
</p>
<p>patriotic was an object of persecution  it is on you that
</p>
<p>the first self-constituted avengers of our betrayed country
</p>
<p>have fixed their regards, to make you the depositaries of
</p>
<p>their confidence, and to delegate to you the primary and
</p>
<p>principle divisions of their intended operations.
</p>
<p>The portion of trust wliich the Secret Directory of
</p>
<p>Public Safety communicates to you is precious and im
</p>
<p>portant ; its guardianship requires much discretion, pru
</p>
<p>dence, activity, and love of general good ; it requires all
</p>
<p>the virtues of men such as the Secret Directory believes
</p>
<p>you to be. The Secret Directory has weighed its funda
</p>
<p>mental organization, and that of its relations with you,
</p>
<p>in the balance of wisdom and circumspection.
</p>
<p>It has deemed it expedient to create twelve municipal
</p>
<p>agents in the twelve arrondissements of the commune of
</p>
<p>Paris ; and it has so arranged their means of communi
</p>
<p>cation with itself, that the correspondence will be almost
</p>
<p>direct without, however, suffering the twelve principal
</p>
<p>agents to know the members of the Directory. The
</p>
<p>reason of this precaution is easily comprehended. It has
</p>
<p>been felt that the most important part of the secret of
</p>
<p>the projected insurrection  that upon which depends the

</p>
<p>success of the whole series of operations  was not so
</p>
<p>much the existence of an insurrectional committee as the
</p>
<p>knowledge of the persons who compose it In fact, should
</p>
<p>tyranny even learn that such a committee exists, no harm
</p>
<p>can result to its members, so long as they are personally
</p>
<p>unknown ; neither can any result to the country, unless
</p>
<p>it be harm to warn despotism to be on its guard, but that
</p>
<p>babeuf s conspiracy. 307
</p>
<p>has happened long ago, because despotism has long since
</p>
<p>been aware that its crimes must have inspired every
</p>
<p>virtuous mind with a disposition to conspire against it.
</p>
<p>There would be, therefore, no great danger in divulging
</p>
<p>the existence of a committee of general revolution, and
</p>
<p>hereafter we may examine whether it would not be even
</p>
<p>wise to take advantage of some juncture to let the secret
</p>
<p>half-transpire, in order to add fuel to the courage of the
</p>
<p>unhappy majority, who only sigh for the opportunity and
</p>
<p>moment for emerging from oppression ; whereas every
</p>
<p>thing would be lost by discovering the leading con
</p>
<p>spirators themselves: in losing them, the combined
</p>
<p>ensemble of ramifications emanating, as they will, from
</p>
<p>a single centre, would be destroyed, and another certain
</p>
<p>and disastrous effect would be, the disconcerting and
</p>
<p>terrifying of the most courageous citizens.
</p>
<p>Such, Republicans, are the motives which have deter
</p>
<p>mined the Directory of Public Safety, notwithstanding
</p>
<p>its immense confidence in you  a fact attested by its
</p>
<p>choosing you to be its principal and primary agents  to
</p>
<p>conceal from even yourselves the names of its members.
</p>
<p>The danger of an indiscretion, or that of a counter-
</p>
<p>determination  nay. the danger prophetically suggested
</p>
<p>to us by a knowledge of human weakness, which too
</p>
<p>often supports as a burden the weight of a great confi
</p>
<p>dence, and seems to find comfort in depositing it in the
</p>
<p>bosom of frisndship, or what appears to be friendship 
</p>
<p>all these and the like have been considered by the Secret
</p>
<p>Directory, and it could not think of abandoning, perhaps,
</p>
<p>the salvation of the country to the hazard of such acci
</p>
<p>dents ; besides, even on the score of fidelity, it is difficult
</p>
<p>to persuade oneself of the possibility of that quality
</p>
<p>existing with equal strength in the breasts of twelve men,
</p>
<p>when made the depositaries of matters of the last im
</p>
<p>portance. The Secret Directory supposes also that it

</p>
<p>will not be the less successful in inspiring you with that
</p>
<p>entire confidence which the exigency of the case requires.
</p>
<p>And why ? Because it has persuaded itself that you will
</p>
<p>see in the hardihood, in the devotion, in the fund of
</p>
<p>virtue required for such an enterprize, sufficient motives
</p>
<p>to accord to it such confidence.
</p>
<p>There is another guarantee which the Directory thinks
</p>
<p>308 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>it may also hold out to you  it is that tone of truth and
</p>
<p>good faith which malevolence can never simulate. Such
</p>
<p>tone you will discern in all its acts.
</p>
<p>At the same time that we have armed ourselves with
</p>
<p>every precaution calculated to render ourselves intangible,
</p>
<p>and our measures impossible to be disconcerted, we de
</p>
<p>sire that you should be secure against any surprise, and
</p>
<p>that by means of particular marks, stamped upon our
</p>
<p>acts, you may be always able to recognize their authen
</p>
<p>ticity, notwithstanding the absence of our real signatures.
</p>
<p>The Secret Directory has pushed its prudence so far
</p>
<p>as to isolate its twelve principal agents  each from the
</p>
<p>rest. They will all receive the same instructions ; they
</p>
<p>will be all charged to do the same things, to concur
</p>
<p>towards the same end ; and, nevertheless, they shall have
</p>
<p>no mutual knowledge of one another. We have con
</p>
<p>sidered such knowledge to be in nowise necessary ; no
</p>
<p>good could result from it ; it manifestly sufficing that
</p>
<p>the directing impulse be immediately received from the
</p>
<p>Secret Directory, by each of its agents, and it being
</p>
<p>incontestible that success is attainable only through
</p>
<p>punctuality of execution, and that any concert amongst
</p>
<p>the twelve agents themselves could only lead to impedi
</p>
<p>ments, delays, or modifications, which might possibly
</p>
<p>diverge from the views and combinations of the regulating
</p>
<p>Directory. Again, the greatest harm might result from
</p>
<p>it, if in a case  which far be it from us to suspect, after
</p>
<p>our scrupulous care in selecting the agents (but, in matters
</p>
<p>of such serious importance, we ought to fear everything,
</p>
<p>to suppose the worst in everything, and to anticipate
</p>
<p>every precaution)  there might, then, we repeat, result
</p>
<p>very great mischiefs from the reciprocal acquaintance and
</p>
<p>mutual intercommunication of the agents ; in case, for
</p>
<p>instance, that one of them should unfortunately commit
</p>
<p>an indiscretion, or an act of perfidy, he would then per

<p>haps immolate all his co-agents, whereas, if he did not
</p>
<p>know them, only himself would suffer from his mal-aduress
</p>
<p>or treachery ; he could neither involve any one in his
</p>
<p>defection, nor disorganize the enterprize so as to com
</p>
<p>promise the fate of liberty.

<p>The same precautions in the way of isolation are taken

<p>in regard to the intermediary agents  the same sciuti-

</p>
<p>nizing care exercised in selecting them ; but independently
</p>
<p>of this attention, everything is besides arranged in respect
</p>
<p>of them, in such manner, that no one of them can com
</p>
<p>promise more than himself, or weaken the strength of
</p>
<p>our party by more than his individual loss. Furthermore,
</p>
<p>he will not know what precise part he will have to play,
</p>
<p>nor that of the principal agent, between whom and the
</p>
<p>Secret Directory he is to form the connecting link of
</p>
<p>communication. He will be led to believe himself em
</p>
<p>ployed for quite another object ; he will not directly
</p>
<p>deliver his packets of correspondence to the Secret Di
</p>
<p>rectory, but everything will reach the hands of the latter
</p>
<p>without any intermediary being in its confidence : thus,
</p>
<p>the principal agents will have no cause to fear being
</p>
<p>betrayed by their co-agents, nor by their intermediary
</p>
<p>aarents, as neither will know them for what they will
</p>
<p>really be. The principal agents will be known only by
</p>
<p>the four members of the Secret Directory ; and these,
</p>
<p>whatever mav turn up, they can have no cause to
</p>
<p>distrust. In general, the Secret Directory having adopted the
</p>
<p>grand system of isolating everything  of preventing all
</p>
<p>intercommunication, it will render its entire organization
</p>
<p>subserv ient to this plan, in such manner, that no individual
</p>
<p>it employs, mediately or immediately, will be able to
</p>
<p>betray any one ; and that his ruin will entail no other
</p>
<p>loss on the Revolutionists. Undoubtedly, such a plan,
</p>
<p>in whicli each party concerned will have only himself to
</p>
<p>distrust, is calculated to embolden all who co-operate
</p>
<p>towarcs its success.
</p>
<p>As to the precautions which extreme prudence alway-
</p>
<p>commands us to take ourselves, in respect of you, in
</p>
<p>order not to be deceived by the reports and information
</p>
<p>of any of you, that is our affair. -We neither exact nor
</p>
<p>establish particular marks, to assure ourselves of the au

<p>thenticity of those reports ; but we are sure to distinguish

<p>that authenticity by unequivocal signs and proofs.
</p>
<p>After having spoken, citizens, of what has appeared to
</p>
<p>us to legitimatize our enterprize, and of what must render
</p>
<p>you individually at ease with yourself in participating in
</p>
<p>it, it is meet to trace out what the Secret Directory con
</p>
<p>siders you will have in the first place to do.
</p>
<p>310 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Articles II. and III. of the organization we have de
</p>
<p>signed for you, and which precede this instruction,
</p>
<p>direct you 
</p>
<p>" To organize in your arrondissement one or more
</p>
<p>" patriotic reunions; in these unions. to feed and direct
</p>
<p>" public spirit by the reading of popular journals, and
</p>
<p>" by discussions on the rights of the people, and its
</p>
<p>" actual situation. To take notes of the daily ther-
</p>
<p>" mometer of opinion ; to render account in these notes,
</p>
<p>" of the disposition, more or less good, more or less
</p>

</p>
<p>" ever individuals you will remark most capable of
</p>
<p>" seconding the progress of the movement in contem-
</p>
<p>" plation ; to indicate the sort of employment or revo-
</p>
<p>" lutionary task for which you will believe each of those
</p>
<p>" individuals best suited ; to set a mark on the intriguers
</p>
<p>" and traitorous knaves who will try to insinuate them-
</p>
<p>" selves into the meeting ; moreover, to render account
</p>
<p>" of the impediments and opposition they may offer to
</p>
<p>" the development of energy, to the inspiration of sound
</p>
<p>" principles and regenerating ideas."
</p>
<p>Articles IV. and V. of the same organization determine
</p>
<p>the means by which you will be able to transmit to the
</p>
<p>Secret Directory the notes, information, or reports, it
</p>
<p>expects at your hands. You will consign them tc the
</p>
<p>intermediary agents, who will go to receive them directly
</p>
<p>from your hands, in the same manner as they will con
</p>
<p>sign to you such ulterior instructions as the Secret
</p>
<p>Directory will find itself obliged to transmit to you.
</p>
<p>Such, citizen, is the scope of the mission entrusted to
</p>
<p>you for the present. Henceforward, we shall have to
</p>
<p>present to you only those ideas of detail, which you will
</p>
<p>modify or not, agreeably to your own discretion.
</p>
<p>When we invite you to organise in your arrondisse
</p>
<p>ment one or more patriotic reunions, we need not suggest

</p>
<p>the expediency of doing the thing quietly and unosten
</p>
<p>tatiously; and it is possible for you "to form such
</p>
<p>reunions, and even to identify their spirit with your's,
</p>
<p>without appearing to be either their founder or leader.
</p>
<p>Let us sacrifice the vanity of appearing to advantage, to
</p>
<p>the glory of being really useful. There is no stronger
</p>
<p>guarantee of grand and substantial success, nothing
</p>
<p>babeuf s conspiracy. 311
</p>
<p>which confers more real self-satisfaction, than the internal
</p>
<p>consciousness that one is the invisible instrument by
</p>
<p>which great springs of action are moved. We then
</p>
<p>render to our genius a merited homage, infinitely supe
</p>
<p>rior to that which eager vanity would arrogate, by
</p>
<p>putting one's self forward as the principal actor in a
</p>
<p>political scene. It will be time enough to receive the
</p>
<p>applauses of our brethren, when we shall have saved them.
</p>
<p>Thus, then, it appears to us perfectly practicable for
</p>
<p>the principal agents to institute, organise, and direct the
</p>
<p>clubs we look for, without appearing to institute, organise,
</p>
<p>or direct anything. By the way, speaking of organisa
</p>
<p>tion, we think, for the like prudential reasons, that we
</p>
<p>should aim less at making new creations, than to base
</p>
<p>our edifice on old elements  the old bases already
</p>
<p>existing. In several arrondissements you have coffee
</p>
<p>houses where the patriots are in the habit of assembling ;
</p>
<p>do you quietly endeavour to draw them there in greater
</p>
<p>numbers, and more frequently. Rather seek, however,
</p>
<p>to multiply those places of meeting, than to crowd them
</p>
<p>with an indiscriminate multitude, unknown to one ano
</p>
<p>ther, and likelv to give umbrage to the Government, as
</p>
<p>well as to provoke its vigilance. Visit each of those
</p>
<p>places in turn ; even prefer private residences to coffee
</p>
<p>houses for holding your meetings, if practicable. In
</p>
<p>private houses, the patriots will be more completely free
</p>
<p> less exposed to police spies  in a better condition to
</p>
<p>admit none but brothei s in whom they can confide. In
</p>
<p>general, avoid giving a public or external importance to
</p>
<p>those assemblings ; do not call them clubs, societies, or
</p>
<p>unions ; avoid all pompous denominations ; say, simply,
</p>
<p>such a coffee-house, such a dwelling ; and the action of
</p>
<p>going there, call taking a stroll  visiting, &c. Let the
</p>
<p>things be, but not the words.

</p>
<p>places of reunion ; it is that of using them to foster and
</p>
<p>direct public spirit. We have laid down that, for that
</p>
<p>purpose, discussions on the rights of the people, and its
</p>
<p>actual position, joined to the reading of popular journals,
</p>
<p>would suffice. Mind ! above all, the reading of popular
</p>
<p>journals! The Secret Directory recommends to you
</p>
<p>this means, as being the most powerful lever. The choice
</p>
<p>312 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>of such journals will not be difficult ; you will easily know
</p>
<p>them. Besides writings, every other means of acting,
</p>
<p>and of making others act, will be supplied to you at the
</p>
<p>proper time. The journals we allude to will, in a great
</p>
<p>measure, serve you as a mariner's compass ; they will
</p>
<p>guide your movements, and serve instead of general in
</p>
<p>structions. Hitherto they have preached our principles,
</p>
<p>and those of all true Democrats. They will, doubtless,
</p>
<p>continue to do so, and in such manner that you will
</p>
<p>always recognize our doctrine in theirs'. To support
</p>
<p>and applaud that doctrine  behold ! almost the whole
</p>
<p>ostensible part of you have to act, and in that you have
</p>
<p>not to quit the circle of demonstrations, which will cause
</p>
<p>you to be regarded only as simple actors, simpleauditors,
</p>
<p>and assistants like the rest. As your function of note
</p>
<p> taking and reporting can only take place with closed
</p>
<p>doors ; your mission still remains, so far as that is con
</p>
<p>cerned, unknown. This latter part of your mission will
</p>
<p>not engage you in any observation of detail ; its manner
</p>
<p>of execution is sufficiently chalked out by Article III. of
</p>
<p>the rules of organization, and by what we have more
</p>
<p>effectively stated in this instruction.
</p>
<p>In stating that the popular journals to be furnished to
</p>
<p>you will serve as your compass, and as principal supple
</p>
<p>ments to the ulterior instructions we shall give (save
</p>
<p>where you receive contrary ones from us), it suffices to
</p>
<p>apprise you that must not make the thermometer of
</p>
<p>energy rise above the degree fixed by those same journals ;
</p>
<p>and -this observation is comprised in that made by the
</p>
<p>Directory, in its act of creation, where it says,  " That
</p>
<p>the overflowing measure of crimes on the part of an
</p>
<p>usurped authority, has ripened the dispositions of all
</p>
<p>minds in favour of a revolutionary explosion to such a
</p>
<p>degree, that to render it beneficial, to put its directors

</p>
<p>sary, perhaps, rather to moderate, than accelerate
</p>
<p>the impetuous burst of freedom."
</p>
<p>Accordingly, however essential it is to warm public
</p>
<p>spirit up to a certain heat, it would be in the same degree
</p>
<p>unsalutary, and even dangerous, to inflame it too rapidly
</p>
<p>until the supreme measure is prepared. We must con
</p>
<p>sider that if the people's opinion is formed, that of the

</p>
<p>caresses of a government which desires to use him to
</p>
<p>subjugate the citizens and the soldier himself. Time is
</p>
<p>necessary to disabuse our armed brethren. It will be
</p>
<p>wise, then, not to heat the citizens' heads beyond the
</p>
<p>just progression of the thermometer of opinion, whose
</p>
<p>varying point will always be indicated by the Secret
</p>
<p>Directory. Behold, citizens, nearly all that we have to com
</p>
<p>municate in this first instruction. Your own zeal, your
</p>
<p>inteUigence, your civism, will supply whatever we may
</p>
<p>have omitted to trace out in the plan of so momentous a
</p>
<p>mission. The perfect knowledge we had beforehand of
</p>
<p>your civic virtues has dispensed us with the necessity of
</p>
<p>using art to inflame your energy. A simple exposition
</p>
<p>of things, the acknowledged justice of which is felt in
</p>
<p>your hearts, as in ours, has appeared sufficient in our
</p>
<p>eyes to convince you of the essential necessity of the
</p>
<p>enterprise to which we engage your concurrence.
</p>
<p>Frenchmen ! it concerns your salvation and ours ; it
</p>
<p>concerns the salvation of the existing generation and of
</p>
<p>posterity  the salvation of our Republic and of the
</p>
<p>world. Let our courage be the signal to the veritable
</p>
<p>people to awake ! Let them, by us electrified, rise from
</p>
<p>a fatal sleep which paralyzes them, and establish for
</p>
<p>ever the reign of happiness, equality, and liberty ! All
</p>
<p>is ready !. . . .The Edifice of Law, which will guarantee

<p>a grand and majestic appearance, only awaits the over

<p>and death, whose place it is to occupy. Let us prepare

<p>this happy catastrophe ! It will be durable and eternal 
</p>
<p>the code we are about to establish  because it will
</p>
<p>ensure the happiness of all. It will not be made to

</p>
<p>MANIFESTO OF THE EQUALS.
</p>
<p>" REAL EQUALITY-THE LAST END OF THE SOCIAL
</p>
<p>ART." Condorcet, Picture of the Human Mind, page 329.
</p>
<p>People of France !  During fifteen ages you have .
</p>
<p>lived slaves, and consequently unhappy. During six
</p>
<p>years you breathe with difficulty in the expectation of
</p>
<p>independance, of prosperity, and of equality.
</p>
<p>Equality !  first vow of nature, first want of man,
</p>
<p>and chief bond of all legitimate association ! People of
</p>
<p>France ! you have not been more favoured than the
</p>
<p>other nations which vegetate on this ill-fated globe !
</p>
<p>Always and everywhere does the unfortunate human
</p>
<p>species, delivered over to cannibals more or less artful,
</p>
<p>serve for a plaything to all ambitions  for pasture to all
</p>
<p>tyrannies. Always and everywhere have men been fooled
</p>
<p>by fine words ; never and nowhere have they obtained
</p>
<p>the thing with the word. From time immemorial we
</p>
<p>have been hypocritically told  men are equal; and
</p>
<p>from time immemorial does the most degrading and
</p>
<p>monstrous inequality insolently oppress the human race.
</p>
<p>Ever since the first existence of civil societies has the
</p>
<p>finest apanage of man been uncontradictedly acknow
</p>
<p>ledged ; but never, up to this moment, has it been once
</p>
<p>realized. Equality has never been other than a beauti
</p>
<p>ful and barren fiction of law. Even now, when it is
</p>
<p>claimed with a stronger voice, we are answered, " Be
</p>
<p>silent, miserables !  absolute equali y is but a chimsera ;
</p>
<p>be content with conditional equality ; you are all equal
</p>
<p>before the law. Rabble! what more do you want?"
</p>
<p>What more do we want ? Legislators, governors, rich
</p>
<p>proprietors  listen in your turn.
</p>
<p>We are all equal, are we not ? This principle remains
</p>
<p>uncontested, because, without being self-convicted of
</p>
<p>folly, one cannot seriously say that it is night when it is

</p>
<p>as we are born so. We desire real equality or death ;

</p>
<p>behold what we want. And we shall have this real
</p>
<p>equality, no matter at what price. Woe to them who
</p>
<p>will interpose themselves between it and us ! Woe to
</p>
<p>him who will offer resistance to so determined a resolve !
</p>
<p>The French Revolution is but the forerunner of
</p>
<p>another revolution far more grand, far more solemn, and
</p>
<p>which will be the last. The people has marched over
</p>
<p>dead bodies against the kings and priests coalesced -
</p>
<p>against it ; it will do the same against the new tyrants 
</p>
<p>against the new political Tartuffes* who have usurped
</p>
<p>the places of the old.
</p>
<p>" What do we want,'' you ask, " more than equality of
</p>
<p>rights V  We want that equality not merely written in
</p>
<p>the " Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the
</p>
<p>Citizen;'' we want it in the midst of us  under the
</p>
<p>root's of our houses. We consent to everything for it 
</p>
<p>to become as pliable wax, in order to have its charac
</p>
<p>ters engraven upon us. Perish, if needs be, all the arts,
</p>
<p>provided real equality abides with us !
</p>
<p>Legislators and governors, who are as destitute of
</p>
<p>genius as of honesty  you rich proprietors, without
</p>
<p>bowels of pity  in vain do you essay to neutralize our
</p>
<p>holy enterprize, by saying, " They are only re-producing
</p>
<p>the old Agrarian law, so often demanded already before
</p>
<p>them." Calumniators ! be silent in your turn ; and in the
</p>
<p>silence of confusion hearken to our pretensions, dictated _
</p>
<p>by nature heiself, and based upon eternal justice. The
</p>
<p>Agrarian law, cr partition of lands, was only the instan
</p>
<p>taneous wish of certain soldiers without principles  of
</p>
<p>certain small tribes, moved by instinct rather than by-
</p>
<p>reason. We aim at something more sublime, and more
</p>
<p>equitable; we look to common property, or the com
</p>
<p>munity of goods ! No more individual property in
</p>
<p>lands. The earth belongs to no one. We claim  we~|

<p>of what belongs to more than twenty millions of men

<p>like themselves  of men in every respect their equals.
</p>
<p>Let there be at length an end to this enormous scandal,
</p>
<p>which posterity will scarcely credit. Away for ever with the
</p>
<p>revolting distinctions of rich and poor, of great and little,
</p>
<p>of masters and servants, of governors and governed.
</p>
<p>Let there be no longer any other differences in man

<p>wants, and the same faculties, let all have accordingly
</p>
<p>the same education  the same nourishment. They are
</p>
<p>content with one sun, and the same air for all ; why
</p>
<p>should not the like portion, and the same quality of
</p>
<p>food, suffice for each according to his wants ?
</p>
<p>But already do the enemies of an order of things, the

<p>most natural that can be imagined, declaim against us,

<p> " Disorganizers, and seditionists," they exclaim, " you

<p>we are organizing has no other object in view than to put

<p>was a more vast design conceived and put in execution.
</p>
<p>At distant intervals in the history of the world it has been

<p>equality, let the elements of justice and felicity be or

<p>Old habits, old prejudices, will again seek to oppose.
</p>
<p>obstacles to the establishment of the Republic of

<p>Equals. The organization of real equality  the only

<p>one which satisfies all wants, without making victims,
</p>
<p>without costing sacrifices  will not, perhaps, at first

<p>please everybody. The egotist, the ambitious, will yell

<p>with rage. Those who possess unjustly, will raise the

<p>cry of injustice. Exclusive enjoyments, solitary plea
</p>
<p>sures, personal ease and privileges, will cause poignant
</p>
<p>regrets to some few individuals who are dead or callous
</p>
<p>to the pangs of others. The lovers of absolute power,
</p>
<p>the vile instruments of arbitrary authority, will feel it

<p>hard that their haughty chiefs should bend to the level

<p>of equality. Their short-sightedness will, with difficulty,

<p>against such a mass of human beings, all happy, and

<p>astonished at having been so long in quest of a felicity
</p>
<p>which they had within hands' reach. On the day that

<p>in amazement  " What  universal happiness depended

<p>on so little ! We had but to will it. Ah, why had we

<p>PIECE No. VIII.
</p>
<p>ANALYSIS OF THE DOCTRINE OF BABEUF.
</p>
<p>proscribed by the executive directory for
</p>
<p>having told the truth !
</p>
<p>ARTICLE 1.
</p>
<p>Nature has given to each individual an equal
</p>
<p>right to the enjoyment of all the goods of life.
</p>
<p>PROOFS,
</p>
<p>DRAWN FROM THE DISCUSSION TO WHICH THIS PIECE GAVE RISE.
</p>
<p>1 . Previously to their first coming together, or forming
</p>
<p>societies, all men were equally masters of the productions
</p>
<p>which nature spread with profusion around them.
</p>
<p>2. Finding themselves together upon an uncultivated
</p>
<p>land, what could have established amongst them the
</p>
<p>inequality of this right ? Is it their natural difference ?
</p>
<p>But they have all the same organs and the same wants.
</p>
<p>Is it the dependence of some upon others ? But no one
</p>
<p>was sufficiently strong to make servants of the rest, who
</p>
<p>might disperse on the slightest occasion for discontent ;
</p>
<p>and the advantage of mutual succours, and of co-opera
</p>
<p>tive benevolence, rendered it necessary for all to respect
</p>
<p>in others, the rights with which they felt themselves in
</p>
<p>vested by nature. Is it the ferocity of their hearts ? But
</p>
<p>compassion is the immediate consequence of their organi
</p>
<p>zation, and ferocity springs only from the exasperation
</p>
<p>of the passions. Is it an inborn penchant for humiliation
</p>
<p>and servitude ? But the sight of distinctions is even for
</p>
<p>the most savage beings a painful sensation  a source of
</p>
<p>jealousy and hatred.
</p>
<p>3. If families have been the first models of societies,
</p>
<p>they are also the most striking proofs of the right we
</p>
<p>speak of. Equality in families is the pledge of tenderness
</p>
<p>on the part of parents  of union and happiness on that
</p>
<p>of the children. Is that equality broken ? Forthwith
</p>
<p>anger and jealousy introduce disorder and violence.

</p>
<p>Everything  even the fondness of parents  inspires the
</p>
<p>babeuf's conspiracy. 319
</p>
<p>children with a hatred of partialities, which the parents
</p>
<p>themselves cannot apply without risking the introduction
</p>
<p>of dangerous passions into the family.
</p>
<p>4. The most strict equality must have been consecrated
</p>
<p>by the first conventions ; for what could have induced
</p>
<p>persons, hitherto the enemies of all distinction, to consent
</p>
<p>to privations and inferiority ?
</p>
<p>5. The forgetfulness of this equality has introduced
</p>
<p>amongst mankind 
</p>
<p>' False ideas of happiness ;
</p>
<p>, Perversion of the passions ;
</p>
<p>Deterioration and decay of the species ;
</p>
<p>Violences, troubles, wars ;
</p>
<p>The tyranny of some, and the oppression of others ;
</p>
<p>Institutions, civil, political, and religious, which, by
</p>
<p>consecrating injustice, end with dissolving societies,
</p>
<p>after having for a long time distracted and torn
</p>
<p>them to pieces.
</p>
<p>x The sight of distinctions, of pomp, and of pleasures
</p>
<p>enjoyed only by a few, was, and ever will be, an inex
</p>
<p>haustible source of torments and uneasiness to the mass.
</p>
<p>It is given to only a few philosophers to preserve them
</p>
<p>selves from corruption, and moderation is a blessing
</p>
<p>wliich the vulgar can no longer appreciate, when once
</p>
<p>their thoughts have been weaned from it. Do certain
</p>
<p>citizens create to themselves new factitious wants, and
</p>
<p>introduce into their enjoyments refinements unknown to
</p>
<p>the multitude ? Simplicity is no longer loved, happiness
</p>
<p>ceases to consist in an active life and tranquil soul, dis
</p>
<p>tinctions and pleasures become the supreme of goods,
</p>
<p>nobody is content with his station, and all seek in vain
</p>
<p>for that happiness, the entrance of which into society is
</p>
<p>debarred by inequality.
</p>
<p>/ The more distinctions we obtain, the more we desire,
</p>
<p>the more we excite jealousy and covetousness ; thence

</p>
<p>that insatiable and criminal thirst for gold and power ;
</p>
<p>thence those sanguinary wars caused by the spirit of
</p>
<p>conquest, and by the jealousy of commerce, which leave
</p>
<p>miserable humanity scarcely a moment of repose.
</p>
<p>In the midst of this subversion of ideas, sloth and vex
</p>
<p>ations destroy a part of the species, enervate another
</p>
<p>part, and prepare for society generations incapable of
</p>
<p>320 BABEUF S CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>defending it. From the love of distinctions arise the pre
</p>
<p>cautions taken to preserve them, in despite of the envy
</p>
<p>and discontent they engender; these precautions are,
</p>
<p>barbarous laws, exclusive forms of government, religious
</p>
<p>fables, servile morality ; in a word, tyranny on the one
</p>
<p>hand, oppression on the other. However, the voice of
</p>
<p>nature cannot be entirely stifled ; at times she makes her
</p>
<p>ungrateful children turn pale, she avenges by occasional
</p>
<p>outbreaks the tears of humanity, and if she rarely succeeds
</p>
<p>in re-establishing its rights, she ends always by over
</p>
<p>throwing the societies which have neglected her laws.
</p>
<p>If equality of goods be a consequence of that of our
</p>
<p>organs and wants  if public and private calamities  if
</p>
<p>the ruin of societies  are inevitable effects of all criminal
</p>
<p>attempts against it, this equality is, therefore, a natural
</p>
<p>right. ARTICLE II.
</p>
<p>The end of society is to defend this equality,
</p>
<p>often assailed by the strong and wicked in the state
</p>
<p>of nature ; and to augment, by the co-operation of
</p>
<p>all, the common enjoyments of all.
</p>
<p>PROOFS.
</p>
<p>1 . By Society is here understood, association regulated
</p>
<p>by conventions ; and by State of Nature, that of casual
</p>
<p>and imperfect society in which men necessarily lived be
</p>
<p>fore they submitted to laws.
</p>
<p>Without examining here, whether criminal attempts
</p>
<p>against equality, of the nature mentioned in this article,
</p>
<p>could have had place in the state of nature, it is evident
</p>
<p>that if the inconveniences of that state determined men
</p>
<p>to establish laws, they must have been only such as arose
</p>
<p>from the violation of equality. At all events, the pre
</p>
<p>servation of equality is the end of association, because,
</p>
<p>by equality alone can men living together be rendered
</p>
<p>happy. 2. By uniting their strength, men assuredly desired to
</p>
<p>procure to themselves the greatest number of enjoyments

</p>
<p>of which they had the idea, and by the least possible
</p>
<p>trouble. Now, the abundance of necessary things ensures these
</p>
<p>enjoyments, and is itself ensured by the labour of those
</p>
<p>BABEUF S CONSPIRACY. 321
</p>
<p>associated together, which is the least possible for each,
</p>
<p>only when it is fairly distributed amongst all.
</p>
<p>ARTICLE III.
</p>
<p>Nature has imposed on each person the obligation
</p>
<p>to work ; nobody could, without crime, evade his
</p>
<p>share of the common labour.PROOFS.
</p>
<p>Labour is for each a precept of nature.
</p>
<p>1 . Because man, isolated in the deserts, could not,
</p>
<p>without some kind of labour, procure himself subsistence.
</p>
<p>2. Because the activity which moderate labour occa
</p>
<p>sions, is for man a source of health and amusement.
</p>
<p>This obligation could not be weakened by society,
</p>
<p>either for all or for each of its members.
</p>
<p>1 . Because the preservation of society depends upon it.
</p>
<p>2. Because, the labour of each is the least possible
</p>
<p>only when all participate of it.
</p>
<p>ARTICLE IV.
</p>
<p>Labour and enjoyments ought to be common.
</p>
<p>EXPLANATION.
</p>
<p>That is to say, all ought to bear an equal portion of
</p>
<p>labour, and derive from it an equal quantity of enjoy
</p>
<p>ments. The justice of this principle follows from the proofs of
</p>
<p>the preceding Articles I. and III. But what do we
</p>
<p>understand by community of labour ? Is it. meant that
</p>
<p>all the citizens should be engaged in the same occupa
</p>
<p>tions ? No ; but it is meant that the different branches
</p>
<p>of labour should be distributed in such manner as to
</p>
<p>leave no able-bodied person idle or unemployed ; it is
</p>
<p>meant that the increased number of workers should, at
</p>
<p>the same time that it diminished individual toil, guarantee
</p>
<p>abundance for the whole ; it is meant, that in return for
</p>
<p>his labour each person shall receive from society the
</p>
<p>means of providing for his natural wants, and for the
</p>
<p>small number of factitious wants which all may satisfy.

<p>But it may be objected  What will become of those

</p>
<p>productions of industry, which are the fruits of time and
</p>
<p>genius ? Is it not to be feared that, being no longer
</p>
<p>better recompensed than other descriptions of work, they
</p>
<p>will be altogether extinguished to the injury of society '.
</p>
<p>p5
</p>
<p>322 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Sophism ! It is to the love of glory, not to the thirst
</p>
<p>for riches, that we have been at all times indebted for
</p>
<p>the efforts of genius. Every day do millions of poor
</p>
<p>soldiers devote themselves to death for the honour of
</p>
<p>serving the caprices of a cruel master; and shall we
</p>
<p>doubt of the prodigies that might be operated on the
</p>
<p>human heart by the sentiment of happiness, the love of
</p>
<p>equality and country, and by the noble incentives of a
</p>
<p>wise policy ? Besides, should we have the same longings
</p>
<p>for the display of the arts, and for the tinsel of luxury,
</p>
<p>if we had the happiness to live under the laws of
</p>
<p>equality ? ARTICLE V
</p>
<p>There is oppression wherever one part of society
</p>
<p>is exhausted by labour, and in ivant of everything,
</p>
<p>rvhilstthe other part wallows in abundance, without
</p>
<p>doing any work at all.
</p>
<p>,, PROOFS.
</p>
<p>1. Inequality and oppression are synonymous ; if to
</p>
<p>oppress an individual consist in violating a general law
</p>
<p>to his detriment, those whom inequality overcharges
</p>
<p>with toil are oppressed, because inequality violates the
</p>
<p>natural law, to which it is absurd to oppose human laws.
</p>
<p>2. To oppress signifies either to restrain the faculties
</p>
<p>of a person, or to unjustly augment his burdens ; that is
</p>
<p>precisely what inequality does, by diminishing the enjoy
</p>
<p>ments of him whose duties it aggravates.
</p>
<p>ARTICLE VI.
</p>
<p>Nobody could, without crime, exclusively appro
</p>
<p>priate to himself the goods of the earth or of
</p>
<p>industry. EXPLANATION AND PROOFS.
</p>
<p>If we demonstrate that inequality has no other cause
</p>
<p>than this exclusive appropriation, we shall have demon
</p>
<p>strated the crime of those who introduced the distinction
</p>
<p>of mine and thine (meum and tuum).

<p>sive right of property. Then each person became abso
</p>
<p>lute master of all he could derive from the fields which
</p>
<p>had devolved to him, and from whatever industry he
</p>
<p>babeuf's CONSPIRACY. 323
</p>
<p>could exercise. It is probable that men, devoted to the
</p>
<p>arts of first necessity, were at the same time excluded
</p>
<p>from all territorial possession, which they had not time
</p>
<p>to cultivate. Thus one portion of the people remained
</p>
<p>masters of the things necessary to existence, whilst the
</p>
<p>rest had only a right to such salaries, or wages, as the '
</p>
<p>former chose to pay them. Nevertheless, this change
</p>
<p>did not involve a very sensible one in the distribution of
</p>
<p>enjoyments, so long as the number of those receiving
</p>
<p>wages did not exceed that of the possessors of the soil.
</p>
<p>But as soon as natural accidents, acting conjointly with
</p>
<p>the economy or address of some, with the prodigality or
</p>
<p>incapacity of others, had concentrated the territorial
</p>
<p>properties in a small number of families, the men of
</p>
<p>wages became vastly more numerous than the pro
</p>
<p>prietors, and, as a natural consequence, were utterly at
</p>
<p>their mercy. The possessors, proud' of their opulence,
</p>
<p>soon reduced the labourers to a life of privations.
</p>
<p>From this revolution date the sinister effects of in
</p>
<p>equality, developed in the first Article. Thenceforward
</p>
<p>we have seen the idle man fatten, by a revolting system
</p>
<p>of injustice, on the sweat of the laborious man, who
</p>
<p>sinks under the weight of fatigues and privations. We
</p>
<p>have seen the rich man take possession of the State,
</p>
<p>and, like a master, dictate tyrannical laws to the poor
</p>
<p>man, exasperated by want, degraded by ignorance, and
</p>
<p>deceived by religion. 
</p>
<p>Miseries and slavery are consequences of inequality,
</p>
<p>which is itself the result of property. Property is, there
</p>
<p>fore, the greatest scourge of society ; it is a veritable
</p>
<p>public crime.
</p>
<p>We shall be told, I know, that property is a right
</p>
<p>anterior to society, which has been instituted to protect
</p>
<p>it. But how could the idea of such a right have been
</p>
<p>formed, before conventions had guaranteed to the pro

</p>
<p>prietor the fruits of his labour ? How could society have
</p>
<p>owed its origin to an institution the most subversive of
</p>
<p>all social sentiment ?
</p>
<p>Lastly, let it not be said that it is just that the laborious
</p>
<p>and economical man should be recompensed by opulence,
</p>
<p>and that the idle man should be punished by misery. No
</p>
<p>doubt, it is equitable that the active man, having dis-
</p>
<p>324 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>charged what he owes his country, should receive in
</p>
<p>return what she can afford to give him, without destroy
</p>
<p>ing herself; it is equitable that his conduct be rewarded
</p>
<p>by public gratitude ; but he cannot thereby acquire the
</p>
<p>right to poison his country, more than a soldier can
</p>
<p>acquire, by his valour, that of reducing her to slavery.
</p>
<p>There are, doubtless, many sad fellows, who ought to
</p>
<p>impute to their own vices the poverty they are reduced
</p>
<p>to ; but it would be to outrage experience and reason to
</p>
<p>range all the unhappy poor in this class, which comprises
</p>
<p>so small a portion of them. What multitudes of labourers
</p>
<p>and artisans live unpitied and uncared for, upon bread
</p>
<p>and water, in order that an infamous libertine may
</p>
<p>squander in peace the accumulations of an inhuman
</p>
<p>father, and that a millionaire master-manufacturer may
</p>
<p>export fabrics and trinkets at low prices to countries,
</p>
<p>which, in return, supply our lazy and voluptuous Sybarites
</p>
<p>with the perfumes of Arabia, and the birds of Phase.
</p>
<p>Would even the bad members of the working classes be
</p>
<p>what they are, were it not for the vices and follies in
</p>
<p>which they are involved by our social institutions, which
</p>
<p>punish in them the effects of passions, whose develop
</p>
<p>ments they provoke ? ARTICLE VII.
</p>
<p>In a veritable society there ought to be neither
</p>
<p>rich nor poor. ARTICLE VIII.
</p>
<p>T/ie rich, who are not willing to renounce their
</p>
<p>superfluities in favour of the indigent, are the
</p>
<p>enemies of the people. ARTICLE IX.
</p>
<p>No one can, by accumulating to himself all the
</p>
<p>means, deprive another if the instruction necessary
</p>
<p>for his happiness. Instruction ought to be common
</p>
<p>to all. PROOFS.
</p>
<p>1. This accumulation deprives the men of labour, of
</p>
<p>even the possibility of acquiring the knowledge necessary
</p>
<p>to every good citizen.

<p>vain have we fleshed our swords in the vile carcases of
</p>
<p>the miscreant slaves who fight for the crowned wolves of
</p>
<p>Europe ; in vain have we bivouaced, fasted, combatted,
</p>
<p>sweated blood and water, and kiUed lice and slaves
</p>
<p>during four years ; we have wasted our shot on sparrows !
</p>
<p> we have lost our labour: for liberty, that noble object

<p>of our aspirations, and sweet equality, its inseparable
</p>
<p>companion, are no longer but vain images caricatured
</p>
<p>on the dishclouts of the kitchen of the heirs of C  , but
</p>
<p>an empty cloud like the smoke of my pipe. In the
</p>
<p>names of order and discipline, we, and all our brother

<p>sans-culottes, are chained like dogs in a poultry yard,
</p>
<p>with the difference that when the mastiffs bark they

<p>you and me as if our mouths were sewed up. Damna

</p>
<p>abandoned our fire-hearths, our wives, our children, our
</p>
<p>fathers and mothers, to thrash the knaves who menaced
</p>
<p>our country, had we dreamt that whilst we were kicking
</p>
<p>emigrants and snaffling kings, a crew of smooth-skinned
</p>
<p>tigers would have strangled, mangled, and devoured
</p>
<p>our parents, friends, and Liberty herself? Yes, my
</p>
<p>friend, yes ; however strange what I announce to you, it
</p>
<p>is no less true than the fact, that one sturdy cove like you
</p>
<p>is worth a cart-load of the ricketty abortions who govern
</p>
<p>us; and the sketch I am going to present of the picture
</p>
<p>that has been before my eyes for the last ten months,
</p>
<p>will convince you of it ; I will not add any oath to
</p>
<p>extort credence from you, for since the oath of fidelity
</p>
<p>to the Constitution of 1793, I have seen none take oaths
</p>
<p>but beggarly scamps, without souls or honour.
</p>
<p>1. The insolent pride of the Court, and of the
</p>
<p>ci-devant great, forced us to overthrow the throne.
</p>
<p>We had established a popular Government, in which, as

<p>Father Latulipe said, every one had the right to think
</p>
<p>himself a citizen; but whilst we were helter-skeltering
</p>
<p>before us the ruffian serf's who presumed to take
</p>
<p>us to account for what we chose to do with our own
</p>
<p>concerns, the rascals of commissaries to whom we
</p>
<p>confided the care of our affairs, after slaughtering those
</p>
<p>of our friends who preserved their fidelity to us, have
</p>
<p>328 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>established, under the name of an Executive Directory,
</p>
<p>five lions, whom they have caparisoned, harnessed, and
</p>
<p>plumed like mules of Provence, and surrounded with
</p>
<p>Scapins, Scaramouches, and Cartouches; who, all
</p>
<p>together, have quintupled the arrogance, insolence,
</p>
<p>tyranny, and despotism of that son of a b  h, C  ,*
</p>
<p>their worthy predecessor.
</p>
<p>2. The Government we had left in 93 put egoism
</p>
<p>under contribution to establish magazines of goods and
</p>
<p>provender necessary to the safety of the country ; that
</p>
<p>which our perfidious commissaries have substituted for it,
</p>
<p>establishes no other public magazine than that of the
</p>
<p>charnel-house of Clamar, composed of thousands of
</p>
<p>carcases of Republicans, dead of hunger, who during
</p>
<p>eighteen long months have been coming in cart-loads
</p>
<p>every hour to choke up that horrible depot.
</p>
<p>3. The nobles had always betrayed us, and we had
</p>
<p>truly conquered only when we had chased them from our
</p>
<p>armies; to-day, the brave cudgelling officers who led
</p>
<p>us to victory  who, like ourselves, have their skins all
</p>
<p>scarified and sewn up again  are basely cashiered, and re
</p>
<p>placed by Chouans of the aristocratic and perfumed castes.

<p>4. Paris  the beautiful Paris of 93  in which liberty,
</p>
<p>equality, and abundance had formed the whole of the
</p>
<p>people into one happy family, no longer presents other
</p>
<p>than a frightful forest, filled with devourino- wolves and
</p>
<p>expiring sheep ; these wolves are the governors and
</p>
<p>the rich, and the sheep are the patriots, our kinsmen,
</p>
<p>brothers, and friends.
</p>
<p>5. Our companions in arms, mutilated in battle, are
</p>
<p>here crushed and spit upon, covered with dirt and con
</p>
<p>tempt by our governors and their base lacqueys ; and the
</p>
<p>greater part of them are sunk into beggarsj imploring
</p>
<p>alms, and cursing the ingratitude of a country for which
</p>
<p>they have shed their blood like ditch-water." Thev are

<p>of humanity. 7. The Government of 93, my dear comrade, has

<p>assured us the spoils of the enemies of the country to

<p>reward our victories. The Government that is, gives, in
</p>
<p>the name of restitution, to our enemies, what we had

<p>conquered from them, and what served as a national
</p>
<p>security for our Republican currency ; whence it follows,
</p>
<p>that the miscreants who govern us, after having trampled

<p>under foot the red cap of liberty they were unworthy to

<p>wear, have shamelessly put a green one on their head;

<p>PIECE No. X.
</p>
<p>Primary Instruction of the Secret Directory addressed
</p>
<p>to each of its principal Military Agents.
</p>
<p>Citizens !  It is not in times of crisis as in ordinary
</p>
<p>times, &c. [Read Piece VI., from the beginning as far
</p>
<p>as the words, " as it would be capable of doing, if it saw
</p>
<p>" at its head leaders worthy of its entire confidence.''
</p>
<p>- Animated with such dispositions, we have been led at
</p>
<p>once to turn our regards to the men most capable of
</p>
<p>seconding us in this most glorious career. It is you,
</p>
<p>citizens, who, whether we regard your continuity of noble
</p>
<p>conduct, together with the multiplied acts of pure civism
</p>
<p>you have evinced throughout the Revolution, or the ter
</p>
<p>rible proofs you have given of courage and incorruptibility,
</p>
<p>in times when everything patriotic and virtuous was per
</p>
<p>secuted ; it is to you, citizens, that those who have con
</p>
<p>stituted themselves the first avengers of a betrayed country
</p>
<p>have turned their regards to make you the depositaries
</p>
<p>of their confidence, and to delegate to you the first and
</p>
<p>principal division of their intended operations.
</p>
<p>The portion of trust which the Secret Directory com
</p>
<p>municates to you is precious and important, its safe
</p>
<p>fulfilment demands much discretion, prudence, activity,
</p>
<p>and love of the general good ; it requires all the virtues
</p>
<p>of men such as the Directory believes you to be.
</p>
<p>The Secret Directory has weighed its fundamental
</p>
<p>organization, and that of its relations with you, in the
</p>
<p>balance of wisdom and circumspection. It has deemed
</p>
<p>it expedient to appoint principal agents near to the dif
</p>
<p>ferent armed bodies placed within and around the com
</p>
<p>mune of Paris, and it has so arranged their means of
</p>
<p>communication with itself, that the correspondence will
</p>
<p>be almost direct, without, however, any of those agents
</p>
<p>being able to know the members of the Directory.
</p>
<p>The reason of this precaution, &c. [Read Piece VI.

<p>from the preceding words, as far as the words, " the
</p>
<p>discouragement and consternation of the most coura
</p>
<p>geous citizens."
</p>
<p>babeuf's conspiracv. 331
</p>
<p>Such are Republicans, &c. [Read Piece VI. again, as
</p>
<p>far as the words, " equally unflinching of twelve men,"
</p>
<p>instead of which substitute, " equally unflinching of
</p>
<p>several men." Read on afterwards as far as the words,
</p>
<p>" you will perceive it in all their acts."]
</p>
<p>" At the same time that we have armed ourselves with
</p>
<p>all the necessary precautions," &c. [Again see paragraph
</p>
<p>in Piece VI., beginning with these words, and read to
</p>
<p>the end without any change.]
</p>
<p>" The Secret Directory has carried its prudence so far
</p>
<p>as to," &c. [The same as in the paragraph in Piece VI.,
</p>
<p>beginning with the same words, except to substitute the
</p>
<p>word agents for twelve agents, in two places.]
</p>
<p>Articles III., IV., V., of the organization we have pre
</p>
<p>scribed to you, and which precede this instruction, indicate
</p>
<p>to you 
</p>
<p>" To form and direct the public spirit of the soldiery
</p>
<p>" in general, and of the corps and battalions which are
</p>
<p>" assigned to you, in particular.
</p>
<p>" To stimulate and foment this military public spirit ;

</p>
<p>" and on the state of the army.
</p>
<p>" To take notes of the daily thermometer of opinion;
</p>
<p>' to render account in these notes of the dispositions,
</p>
<p>" more or less good, more or less energetic, of the mass
</p>

</p>
<p>" remark most capable of forwarding the movement to

<p>" be produced ; to indicate the species of employment
</p>
<p>" or revolutionary enterprise to which you may believe
</p>
<p>" each of those individuals best suited ; to fix a mark on
</p>
<p>" the intriguers, the serviles, the tyrannical subalterns ;
</p>
<p>" and to render account of the obstacles they may oppose

</p>
<p>" good principles, and regenerating ideas."
</p>
<p>Articles VI., VII., and VIII. of the same organization
</p>
<p>determines the means by which you will be able to trans
</p>
<p>mit to the Secret Directory the notes, informations, or
</p>
<p>reports it will expect at your hands.
</p>
<p>" You will give them to the intermediary agents, who
</p>
<p>332 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>" will go to receive them directly from your hands, in the
</p>
<p>" same manner as they will consign to you personally
</p>
<p>" such ulterior instructions as the Secret Directory shall
</p>
<p>" find itself obliged to transmit to you."
</p>
<p>Such, citizens, is the scope of the task assigned
</p>
<p>you in this elementary stage. Hereafter we shall have
</p>
<p>only to offer to you some ideas of detail, which you may
</p>
<p>modify as prudence dictates.
</p>
<p>When we invite you to stimulate, feed, and direct the
</p>
<p>public spirit of the soldiery, by reading, and by discussions
</p>
<p>on the rights of the people, on its actual situation, and
</p>
<p>on the situation of the army, you will feel how expedient
</p>
<p>it is for the interest of the cause, as well as for your own,
</p>
<p>that the thing should be done quietly, and without osten
</p>
<p>tatiously aiming at too much. It is possible for you to
</p>
<p>become the leader of a great number of brave fellows,
</p>
<p>and to infuse into them your own spirit, without their
</p>
<p>being conscious of the source whence they imbibed it :
</p>
<p>it would be far more dangerous were their chiefs, and all
</p>
<p>who have an interest contrary to the principles we wish
</p>
<p>to inculcate, to discern the part you were playing about
</p>
<p>them. You ought, therefore, to look vigilantly to your
</p>
<p>selves, and use extreme precaution, lest you betray your
</p>
<p>object by inconsiderate avowals, or by reposing confidence
</p>
<p>in any person, no matter whom. It is not on occasions
</p>
<p>like this that one can indulge his self-love. Let us sacri
</p>
<p>fice the vanity of appearing to the advantage of really
</p>
<p>being and doing. There is no stronger guarantee of
</p>
<p>great and signal success, there is nothing which confers
</p>
<p>a prouder internal satisfaction, than the consciousness
</p>
<p>that one is the invisible instrument by which great springs
</p>
<p>of action are moved ; we then render to our genius and
</p>
<p>discretion a merited homage, infinitely superior to that
</p>
<p>which eager vanity would grasp, by wishing to pass for
</p>
<p>principal actor in a political scene. It will be time

</p>
<p>enough to receive the applause of our brethren after we
</p>
<p>shall have saved them ; wherefore, then, it appears to us
</p>
<p>very practicable for the principal agents to stimulate,
</p>
<p>foster, and guide the soldier's energy without hardly ap
</p>
<p>pearing to do so ; for since the only thing required is, to
</p>
<p>fix his attention on the violation of all the rights of the
</p>
<p>people, and on the cruel and deplorable state to which
</p>
<p>babeuf's conspiracy. 333
</p>
<p>the citizen and soldier are now reduced, such habitual
</p>
<p>conversations and discussions as we have proposed to you
</p>
<p>to get up, may be effected by the sole means of journals,
</p>
<p>and other popular writings ; and it will not be difficult
</p>
<p>for you to transmit these writings, whether directly or
</p>
<p>indirectly, in a safe and quiet way, that will involve no
</p>
<p>consequences, be scarcely noticed, and leave you to
</p>
<p>appear throughout only as a simple observer.
</p>
<p>The dissemination of writings, then, being the prin
</p>
<p>cipal means on which we count for promoting those
</p>
<p>serious discussions in which we desire to engage the
</p>
<p>soldier, we recommend to you this means. The choice
</p>
<p>of the writings will not be difficult ; you will easily dis
</p>
<p>tinguish those of the right stamp. For the rest, it will
</p>
<p>be the business of the Directory to transmit such writings
</p>
<p>to you, so that you may have them in sufficient quantity
</p>
<p>tor distribution. Besides writings, all other means of
</p>
<p>acting, and of making others act, will be furnished to
</p>
<p>you when occasion demands. The journals we have
</p>
<p>alluded to will serve you, in a great measure, as a com
</p>
<p>pass to steer your course, and for general instructions
</p>
<p>conformable to this. They have, up to the present,
</p>
<p>preached our principles, and those of all true Democrats.
</p>
<p>We believe they will always continue to do so, and that
</p>
<p>you will always recognize our doctrine in their's. To
</p>
<p>support and applaud that doctrine,  behold nearly the
</p>
<p>whole of the part assigned you in the new drama, and
</p>
<p>to play it well you need not travel out of the circle of those
</p>
<p>demonstrations, which make you appear only as simple
</p>
<p>actors, simple auditors, and by-standers like all the
</p>
<p>others present. As your function of note-taking and
</p>
<p>reporting will take place only with closed doors, it leaves
</p>
<p>your mission still a secret. This latter department will
</p>
<p>not engage us in any observation of detail ; its mode of
</p>
<p>execution is sufficiently determined by Article V. of the

<p>minds up to a certain heat, it would be in the same

<p>rapidly before the final measure. We are certain that
</p>
<p>the people's opinion is formed ; we are no less certain
</p>
<p>that the same may be said of several battalions ; but we
</p>
<p>know also that there are many armed bodies whom the
</p>
<p>influence of craft and perfidy has hitherto kept in error.
</p>
<p>It is essential, then, in order to ensure complete success,
</p>
<p>that all, citizens and soldiers, be disciplined to move
</p>
<p>simultaneously with us. We must not, therefore, excite
</p>
<p>a part to that degree of energy required for the grand
</p>
<p>explosion, while the others remain considerably behind
</p>
<p>in spirit and disposition. We must allow ourselves time
</p>
<p>to undeceive at least the majority of our comrades, and
</p>
<p>fortify them against the insidious caresses of a Govern
</p>
<p>ment which desires to use them as instruments, first to
</p>
<p>oppress themselves, and afterwards the people. Accord
</p>
<p>ingly, it will be the part of wisdom not to inflame the
</p>
<p>passions of the more ardent Democrats above the
</p>
<p>exact progression of the thermometer, whose varying
</p>
<p>point will be always indicated by the Secret Directory.
</p>
<p>We have not yet proposed the lever, which we deem
</p>
<p>the most powerful of all for exciting the soldier's mind
</p>
<p>and courage. We proceed to tell it you. It is a long-
</p>
<p>acknowledged truth, that to impel men to vigorous
</p>
<p>action, you must appeal to their interests. The general
</p>
<p>interest is made up of all the particular interests. We
</p>
<p>must, therefore, conciliate those particular interests, if
</p>
<p>we would operate the real good of the whole ; and, since
</p>
<p>these same interests are for all men the most powerful
</p>
<p>springs of action, it follows that, in employing this grand
</p>
<p>instrument, we at the same time perform a thing the
</p>
<p>most just and capable of guaranteeing certain success.
</p>
<p>Let us appeal, then, to the interest of the greatest
</p>
<p>number  that is to say, let us be virtuous and equitable,
</p>
<p>for virtue and justice present us with the surest means

<p>of success.
</p>
<p>It is for the interest of the greatest number that the
</p>
<p>Revolution was undertaken ; it is because, previously to
</p>
<p>the Revolution, the majority found themselves socially
</p>
<p>aggrieved and oppressed, that they desired a change to
</p>
<p>improve their condition. The interest of the majority
</p>
<p>caused the Revolution to be adored so long as a hope
</p>
<p>babeuf's conspiracy. 335
</p>
<p>was entertained that it would operate a change for the
</p>
<p>better. The same interest has caused the Revolution to
</p>
<p>be detested, since its more recent events taught the
</p>
<p>majority to see in it only a change from bad to worse.
</p>
<p>It is the interest of the majority that now induces us to
</p>
<p>commence another Revolution, which we wish to be the
</p>
<p>last, and whose object is to change the worse into a
</p>
<p>perfect good. Let us prove to the majority the possibi
</p>
<p>lity of this latter change. Let us do more let us show
</p>
<p>them the certainty of it, and we shall see that their
</p>
<p>interest will determine them to ensure it, by the ener
</p>
<p>getic and irresistible ascendancy of their volition and
</p>
<p>force. There are two principal points of view in which we
</p>
<p>can and ought to address ourselves to the interest and
</p>
<p>feelings of the men who have defended the country 
</p>
<p>their interest as applicable to their present lot  their
</p>
<p>interest as applicable to their future lot.
</p>
<p>May you not with perfect truth exhibit to the soldiei
</p>
<p>a picture, in which he will recognize himself miserable,
</p>
<p>like the people, equally destitute as the people, equally
</p>
<p>starved and famished, equally cheapened and degraded ?
</p>
<p>I behold a poor fellow returning from the frontier. In
</p>
<p>what state is he ? His bare aspect is enough to let me
</p>
<p>see that our governors are the best friends of the despots
</p>
<p>he has combatted ! I see him the victim of neglect and
</p>
<p>suffering, for having made their satellites bite the dust.
</p>
<p>His person lank  his face pale and haggard  he sinks
</p>
<p>from inanition. I interrogate him ; he tells me that the
</p>
<p>deplorable state I find him in, is not surprising when the
</p>
<p>cause is explained. I learn that his pay is more beggarly
</p>
<p>than that of the vilest German military slave. With
</p>
<p>thirty sous in assignats, and only two sous per day in
</p>
<p>cash, it is a miracle that he is not starved to death. In
</p>
<p>a word, he is worse treated than the wretched German
</p>
<p>serf, or the vile Italian thief-catcher, who, brutalized,

</p>
<p>Austria pays at about the same rate, and whose hungry
</p>
<p>aspect inspired me with so much pity at the commence

<p>ment of the Revolution. The soldier of our country

</p>
<p>of the question, for that would cost thirty francs,* and
</p>
<p>where, poor wretch, could he find such a sum ? But
</p>
<p>he suffers more than the want of clothing and nourish
</p>
<p>ment. He must in addition, be harassed, vexed, crushed
</p>
<p>under a multiplicity of tortures decorated with the pom
</p>
<p>pous name of military discipline ; and which is, at bot
</p>
<p>tom, a far more galling system of refined tyranny than
</p>
<p>existed under the lordly ministers of Louis XVI. It
</p>
<p>renders the soldier far more of an automaton, far more
</p>
<p>servilely subject to the caprices of subalterns. He is
</p>
<p>degenerated, in fact, into a mere moving man-machine,
</p>
<p>who must know nothing but the word of command. To
</p>
<p>reason, to speak, nay, even to think, are interdicted
</p>
<p>from him. Moreover, the tyrants in authority over him
</p>
<p>are not the men who accompanied him in the perils of
</p>
<p>war. It is not the bravest that are promoted; it is not
</p>
<p>the men who most distinguished themselves against the
</p>
<p>enemies of liberty that are rewarded by honours. On
</p>
<p>the contrary, those now in command are, for the most
</p>
<p>part, base, dastardly intriguers, and even counter-revo
</p>
<p>lutionists. Real military merit is devoted to neglect
</p>
<p>and opprobrium. Thus is the defender of the country
</p>
<p>overwhelmed at once by every calamity incidental to his
</p>
<p>state. He is not clothed, he is not fed ; he bends
</p>
<p>under the cruel rod of contemptible chiefs, who never
</p>
<p>fought for the Republic, who detest it, and, with it, all
</p>
<p>who have poured their blood for its triumph. If any
</p>
<p>exceptions are made to the destitution and privations of
</p>
<p>the mass of soldiers, it is only in a sense which caps the
</p>
<p>climax of perfidy and national humiliation. Baits and
</p>
<p>lures are offered to some, the better to consolidate the

<p>slavery of the rest. Those distributions of wine, of

<p>Such, or the like, is the picture  alas ! too true a one
</p>
<p> of the present condition of the soldier, which you

<p>should continually present to his view, and alongside of

<p>them a just, a legitimate compensation (too well was it

<p>its success ; the Revolution had promised them national

<p>property, quite enough to secure subsistence for each
</p>
<p>and all. . With this recompense, worthy of their toils,
</p>
<p>they might pass, in an honourable retreat, the remainder

<p>of their lives tranquil and happy; form new families

<p>without number ; bring up a new generation in the love

<p>of a country whose happiness they might have justly

<p>by what combined and consecutive acts of courage they

<p>had succeeded in shaking off the yoke of the oppressors

</p>
<p>The defender of his country was not on returning to
</p>
<p>his cottage to find it domineered over by the turretted
</p>
<p>castle of the insolent squire, who, with all the soil in his
</p>
<p>possession, made the soldier's father work as a slave,
</p>
<p>treated him in all respects as such, allowed him not half
</p>
<p>food enough, and never permitted him to be decently
</p>
<p>clothed. The defender of his country was to find in the
</p>
<p>vast possessions monopolized by this insatiable ogre his
</p>
<p>allotted portion, which would suffice with industry to
</p>
<p>yield him a comfortable living. Nothing of the kind!
</p>
<p>Instead of what was promised, he will find this devouring
</p>
<p>monster more furious, more unpitying than ever. The
</p>
<p>latter will behold in the poor old broken-down soldier,
</p>
<p>the man who fought against him when he was an emi
</p>
<p>grant, who eagerly desired his utter destruction, and who
</p>
<p>still regrets that it was not consummated. The feudal
</p>
<p>despot will exact a long and dire repentance for such
</p>
<p>crimes. The ancient defender of liberty will pass his old
</p>
<p>age in bitter bondage and frightful misery. More
</p>
<p>trampled on, more degraded than his forefathers, out

<p>shall not be said that they will no longer use their
</p>
<p>own judgment, or that, captivated by false and vain
</p>
<p>caresses, by debasing distributions of drink, they
</p>
<p>helped a Government of usurpation and oppression to
</p>
<p>rivet for ever the chains of twenty-five millions of
</p>
<p>' their fellow-countrymen."
</p>
<p>And as to you, citizen, to whom we address these first
</p>
<p>instructions, after suggesting this sketch of the way in
</p>
<p>which you ought to catechise our armed brothers, we
</p>
<p>will not add a word more to inspire you with the spirit of
</p>
<p>our principles, and the extreme importance of the mission
</p>
<p>we have imposed on ourselves. Neither will we further
</p>
<p>enlarge on what we have pointed out as the most effective
</p>
<p>means of seconding our operations. " Your zeal, your
</p>
<p>intelligence, your civism, will supply the rest." [See

<p>Piece VI., beginning with those words, and read on to

<p>DO WE OWE OBEDIENCE TO THE CON
</p>
<p>STITUTION OF 1795.
</p>
<p>In swearing to defend Liberty and Equality, we have
</p>
<p>reciprocally bound ourselves in solemn engagement to
</p>
<p>one another, never to recognise any other authority than
</p>
<p>that of the people, and to punish all who, by force or
</p>
<p>fraud, should presume to violate its sovereign will. This
</p>
<p>solemn engagement renders it a duty imperative on all
</p>
<p>of us to examine coolly and scrupulously whether the

<p>Republican Government desired by the people.

</p>
<p>Those whom we have seen uniformly combat in the
</p>
<p>ranks of the defenders of liberty, reject as counter
</p>
<p>revolutionary the Act of 1795. Those, on the con
</p>
<p>trary, who never appeared decided for anything, except
</p>
<p>their own selfish interests, extol this Act as the funda
</p>
<p>mental law, par excellence. They deny the former
</p>
<p>party even the right of examining it, and wish to com
</p>
<p>mand for it the same religious respect that was exacted
</p>
<p>five years ago for the Royalist Constitution of 1791.
</p>
<p>In a struggle, the issue of which ought for ever to set
</p>
<p>at rest the conscience of all upright men, it is of so\ t-
</p>
<p>reign importance to light our way by the flambeau o.
</p>
<p>principles, developed and applied by arguments matured
</p>
<p>and independent of persons and parties ; for if, in short,
</p>
<p>the Constitution of 1795 do possess all the characteristics
</p>
<p>of legitimate law, we ought to submit to and defend it ;
</p>
<p>but if it be devoid of such characters, then is it the duty
</p>
<p>of freemen to overthrow it, and to punish the men who
</p>
<p>would have enslaved the people.
</p>
<p>I am aware that the bare wish to examine impartially
</p>
<p>what we are all so interested in knowing, will be called
</p>
<p>anarchy, rebellion  favourite terms of the Court before
</p>
<p>and after 1789, of La Fayette, of Dumouriez, of the
</p>
<p>Venetian Senate, of the Pope, of the Grand Seignor,
</p>
<p>which signify neither more nor less than that the present
</p>
<p>possessors of power wish to retain it, no matter at wtiat
</p>
<p>price ; but we, who deem it an honour to be rebels and
</p>
<p>seditious agamst all anti-popular powers, whatever jargon
</p>
<p>they talk, whatever masks they wear, will always counsel
</p>
<p>our fellow-citizens to make use of their reason, and to
</p>
<p>incessantly rise up against every authority opposed to
</p>
<p>the principles of popular sovereignty.
</p>
<p>Previously to the famous report of the Commission ot
</p>
<p>Eleven, we had the Constitution of 1793, which was
</p>
<p>generally recognised as being the veritable fundamental

<p>law of the French people, because it had received their
</p>
<p>formal sanction by the suffrages of 4,800,000 voters in
</p>
<p>the primary assembhes, whose envoys, to the number of
</p>
<p>8,000, confirmed the thus-declaied will of France, upon
</p>
<p>the ever-memorable day of the 10th of August, 1793 ;
</p>
<p>and what rendered that law, and the people who ac
</p>
<p>cepted it, so laudable in the sight of humanity, was the
</p>
<p>344 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>equality of rights it guaranteed to all Frenchmen, with
</p>
<p>out regard to the state of domestic servitude, which it
</p>
<p>proscribed, and without distinguishing between rich and
</p>
<p>poor  the necessary concurrence of the people in forming
</p>
<p>the law, and the latitude secured for giving effect to the
</p>
<p>people's wishes in the way of having them heard and
</p>
<p>respected*  circumstances which, whatever our states
</p>
<p>men may pretend, struck at the root of civil convulsion,
</p>
<p>by extirpating all contrast between the will of the sove
</p>
<p>reign and that of its delegates. How fine a sight !  to
</p>
<p>behold perhaps a twentieth of the people arrest the crimes
</p>
<p>or faults of its agents, and provoke against them the
</p>
<p>effective judgment of all their fellow-citizens, without a
</p>
<p>single shock to the public tranquillity?
</p>
<p>When we speak of the beauties of the Constitution of
</p>
<p>1793 to the partisans of the existing order, they pretend
</p>
<p>to oppose to us a posterior will of the people, who, say
</p>
<p>they, had a right to change that Constitution, and have
</p>
<p>effectually done so in accepting the Constitution of 1795.
</p>
<p>p Undoubtedly, if the French have freely accepted this
</p>
<p>latter Constitution, we owe it obedience until it adopts
</p>
<p>another ; but it is precisely on this fact, whicli is the
</p>
<p>matter in dispute, that we are to bring the discussion
</p>
<p>strictly to bear. Is it the people, or even a large section
</p>
<p>of the people, which demanded the change? Certainly
</p>
<p>not. The people has loudly and unanimously reclaimed
</p>
<p>its Constitution of 1793. Witness the numerous ad
</p>
<p>dresses of the communes, of the popular societies, and
</p>
<p>the armies ; witness the scenes of Prairial at Paris, and
</p>
<p>the almost simultaneous ones in the north and south of
</p>
<p>the Republic ; witness the acts of the Convention, which,
</p>
<p>to render homage to the will of the people, and to calm
</p>
<p>apprehensions, decreed, on the 1st Germinal, of the same
</p>
<p>year, the penalty of deportation against whosoever should
</p>
<p>write or speak against the Constitution of 1793.

</p>
<p>theless, the too celebrated Commission of Eleven, whose
</p>
<p>powers were limited to merely proposing the organic
</p>
<p>laws of the Constitution of 1793, came to the body of
</p>
<p>the Convention to declaim against what it qualified with
</p>
<p>the term of popular tyranny; and that Convention
</p>
<p>itself, in disregard of its duties and oaths, instead of

<p>hurling the Commission into annihilation, had the au
</p>
<p>dacity to propose to the people its anti-popular fabrication
</p>
<p>of 1795. No fact can be more evident than that the
</p>
<p>Commission of Eleven, and the Members of the Con

<p>vention who voted for the change, have overstepped
</p>
<p>their powers, and betrayed the people by this open

<p>violation of its clear and solemn will.
</p>
<p>There took place, however, certain events which the

<p>legitimatize their crimes, and to escape the penalties

<p>of treason, which they manifestly incurred. The Con

<p>primary assemblies and to the armies,"' the extracts of
</p>
<p>whose registers, made by those personally interested in
</p>
<p>the matter, have " verified " that 900,000 citizens have
</p>
<p>voted for its acceptation. If this acceptation be the free

<p>expression of the people's will, the Constitution of 1795

</p>
<p>4,800,000 citizens have voted for the Constitution of

<p>1793; only 900,000 have assented to the Act of 1795.
</p>
<p>What has become of the remaining 3,900,000 ? Either
</p>
<p>their vote has not been verified, or they have not presented

<p>themselves at the primary assemblies. If the first sup

<p>3,900,000, who had voted on the former occasion, is suffi

<p>cient to warrant the presumption of a change of will and

<p>* The Constitution of 1793 was not sent to the armies ; never
</p>
<p>theless, it had 4,800,000 votes. What apology is to be made for
</p>
<p>the legislator who, having recourse to the votes of soldiers, trained

<p>in habits of blind obedience to their chiefs, afterwards commands,

<p>in the name of their bayonets, the consent of the rest of the

</p>
<p>tacit consent on their part, or whether it is only the effect
</p>
<p>of violence exercised by the counter-revolutionists.
</p>
<p>But in order to prove that their silence ought to be
</p>
<p>taken for consent, it is necessary, according to all rules
</p>
<p>of law, that it be proved.
</p>
<p>1 . That the 3,900,000 citizens had it in their power
</p>
<p>to attend the assemblies, and would have incurred no
</p>
<p>danger in pronouncing against the Act of 1795.
</p>
<p>2. That this Act does not violate the natural and
</p>
<p>inalienable rights of the citizens ; for otherwise, the most
</p>
<p>formal consent could be considered only as an act of
</p>
<p>madness and blindness, involving no obligation ; and in
</p>
<p>this case, the acceptation of some would be a palpable
</p>
<p>act of oppression against the rest.
</p>
<p>Let us call to mind what was the fate at Paris, Toulon,
</p>
<p>Valenciennes, &c.  of those who, in Prairial of the Year
</p>
<p>III., demanded the execution of the Constitution of 1 793 ;
</p>
<p>let us call to mind how the Convention caused the people
</p>
<p>who reclaimed it to be shot and guillotined ; how it
</p>
<p>massacred and hunted down, without regard to the laws
</p>
<p>and forms it had itself prescribed, and by the most
</p>
<p>monstrous violation of justice and decency, those of its
</p>
<p>members who refused to participate in the disgrace of its
</p>
<p>treasonable proceedings ; let us call to mind the pro
</p>
<p>tracted and atrocious persecution which indiscriminately
</p>
<p>menaced the defenders of the Constitution of 1793, in
</p>
<p>the interior and in the armies ; and let us afterwards
</p>
<p>judge of the state of liberty, when there were citizens
</p>
<p>found to kill themselves in the primary assemblies, in
</p>
<p>order to escape the bloody proscription which her new
</p>
<p>tyrants were then exercising all over France.*
</p>
<p>Ah ! if this silence, so imperiously commanded by the
</p>
<p>exercise of terror over the good  a terror operated by

<p>the execution and incarceration of all the warmest friends

<p>who are in a state of domestic service ?* Is it not true

<p>but hold their power only from the most opulent, most

<p>cruel, and most vicious part of the nation ? Frenchmen !

<p>these iniquities sealed by the blood of our friends, immo

<p>You desire, tyrants, that this silence should be reputed

<p>their own servitude ? Will you say that the French,

<p>RECAPITULATION.
</p>
<p>The Constitution of 1793 has had 4,800,000 suffrages.
</p>
<p>That of 1795 has had posteriorly. . 900,000 ditto.
</p>
<p>With respect to the latter, no votes
</p>
<p>were given by 3,900,000 citizens.
</p>
<p>Silence is not a tacit consent.
</p>
<p>1. Because it has been commanded by a long system
</p>
<p>of terror by the assassination and bastilizaticn of the
</p>
<p>patriots. 2. Because the Constitutional Act of 1795 violates
</p>
<p>the natural rights of man, which no one can renounce.
</p>
<p>This silence is therefore a formal disavowal. It follows
</p>
<p>from this reasoning, which we defy all the partisans of
</p>
<p>inequality to answer : 
</p>
<p>1. That the Constitution of 1793 is the sole and veri

<p>table law of the French people.
</p>
<p>2. That the Act of 1795 is the result of violence and
</p>
<p>tyranny, which cannot be defended without crime.
</p>
<p>3. That no one can exercise, without treason towards

<p>the people, the powers which emanate from the Counter

<p>ADDRESS OF THE TRIBUNE OF THE PEOPLE
</p>
<p>To the Army of the Interior*
</p>
<p>Soldiers !  In a Republic which was once superior
</p>
<p>to what our Republic is now, the army and the people
</p>
<p>had what we have not. Rome had her Tribunes of the
</p>
<p>People and her Military Tribunes. They were magis
</p>
<p>trates whom the law appointed to be perpetual defenders
</p>
<p>of the people and of the army. The Tribunes of the
</p>
<p>People were elected by the people, and their duty con
</p>
<p>sisted in keeping incessant watch lest any criminal attempt
</p>
<p>should be made on the people's rights ; they were to be

</p>
<p>* Extract from No. 41 of the Tribune of the People.
</p>
<p>babeuf's conspiracy. 349
</p>
<p>incessantly attentive to curb the ambition and injustice
</p>
<p>of the senate and patricians, or of the rich ; and they had
</p>
<p>the privilege of opposing every law which might seem to
</p>
<p>them contrary to the people's interest or to general hap
</p>
<p>piness. The Military Tribunes, chosen in the same way
</p>
<p>by the soldier, were similarly employed in keeping watch
</p>
<p>for him, in defending his rights, and in always opposing
</p>
<p>whatever might tend to harass, betray, or deceive him.
</p>
<p>In France this august tribunitian magistracy has not
</p>
<p>been established. The person now addressing you has
</p>
<p>felt the utility of its existing, at least morally. I have
</p>
<p>constituted myself, by means of a periodical paper, Tri
</p>
<p>bune of the People. My office is but a faint miniature
</p>
<p>of the tribuneship of the Romans. I enjoy only the
</p>
<p>right (and even for this I have a hard struggle) to follow
</p>
<p>and watch the march of the Government, and to warn
</p>
<p>my fellow-citizens when I discern acts which I deem
</p>
<p>inimical to justice and to their common interest. The
</p>
<p>right of opposing such acts is wanting to me. I exercise
</p>
<p>only a portion of influence on public opinion, and this
</p>
<p>portion is measured by the degree of confidence I inspire.
</p>
<p>If I judge rightly, the striking evidence which I have
</p>
<p>succeeded in placing along side all the truths I have
</p>
<p>presented to the people, has attached to me the sound
</p>
<p>and honest part of this people  the major, the interest
</p>
<p>ing, the useful part  the part from which you, soldiers,
</p>
<p>are drawn  the part, in short, which is insolently
</p>
<p>called plebeian. So strongly attached, indeed, that,
</p>
<p>without any Constitutional institution, this title of
</p>
<p>Tribune, by the assent and sanction of the people, is not
</p>
<p>illusory. The people has, therefore, in France, as in
</p>
<p>ancient Rome, the tribuneship in reality. I dare say
</p>
<p>they possess it as veritably as did the Romans under
</p>
<p>their best tribunes, under Lucius Junius, under Viscel-
</p>
<p>linus, under Arsa, under Dentatus, under Canuleius,

<p>under Stolon, under the Gracchi. Like them, it is my
</p>
<p>pride to have earned the hatred of traitors  the con
</p>
<p>fidence and esteem of the major part of my fellow-
</p>
<p>citizens. With this confidence, the right of opposing, which I
</p>
<p>have not, for want of the legal institution, is, neverthe
</p>
<p>less, in great measure realized to the advantage of the
</p>
<p>350 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>people, by means of the sanction it gives me in repro
</p>
<p>bating such acts of the Government as I demonstrate to
</p>
<p>be contrary to its just interests and rights. The people,
</p>
<p>when enlightened respecting the injustice it experiences,
</p>
<p>renders feeble the decisions of its guilty delegates ; and
</p>
<p>the vast and universal expression of discontent it sends
</p>
<p>abroad is equivalent to a formal opposition, because it
</p>
<p>is impossible for tyranny, however expert and crafty, to
</p>
<p>give durability to what a whole nation rejects.
</p>
<p>- Why, then, with such advantages, almost equal to
</p>
<p>those of the Tribunes of Rome, have I not yet obtained
</p>
<p>the same success which they were accustomed to obtain ?
</p>
<p>Ah ! my brothers, you must have foreseen the reason.
</p>
<p>You will perceive, according to what I have stated, that
</p>
<p>something is still wanting to place us on a level of
</p>
<p>advantage with the Romans. I am but a tribune of the
</p>
<p>people ; you have no military tribunes. Thus referring
</p>
<p>to what certain parties say, you may easily perceive this
</p>
<p>deficiency on our side. To believe these persons, your

</p>
<p>general, equal to the intelligence and public spirit of the

<p>other citizens .... Nay, they go so far as to assert that
</p>
<p>you are prepared to justify, by your conduct, the expres

<p>far from true .... that the aggregate of your body

</p>
<p>For what purpose are you congregated in such large
</p>
<p>numbers around this metropolis ?  the city of the Revo
</p>
<p>lution ?  the cradle of liberty ? Why are you called
</p>
<p>here ? Are its inhabitants rebels ? Is it required to
</p>
<p>subjugate them ? These are questions whicli it is not
</p>
<p>unimportant to throw some light upon.
</p>
<p>Soldiers ! it is not for the real people that you form
</p>
<p>around our walls a formidable pale ! This real people 
</p>
<p>the industrious, working people  is maltreated here,
</p>
<p>muzzled, outraged, despised, starved, ruined, Ly the
</p>
<p>people of stock-jobbers and public robbers ! .... It is
</p>
<p>this latter description of people which is in a most
</p>
<p>criminal state of rebellion against the good people ! But
</p>
<p>is it to subjugate the oppressive party, and to defend the
</p>
<p>oppressed party, that you present a triple array of
</p>
<p>bayonets around the circumference of Paris ? No ! but
</p>
<p>quite the contrary .... The tyrants mean to use your
</p>
<p>arms and force to utterly crush the oppressed under the
</p>
<p>oppressors' yoke !  to maintain the latter in their odious
</p>
<p>domination, and the people in its sufferings and despair
</p>
<p>ing impotence ! Ah ! if the object was to defend the
</p>
<p>people, there would be no necessity to draw off from the
</p>
<p>frontiers their brethren, whose destination is to combat
</p>
<p>the external foe ! For the rest, the people would suffice
</p>
<p>to defend itself. But when it is sought to sacrifice the
</p>
<p>mass to a fraction, then are distant succours required.
</p>
<p>It is then the tyrants expect to find such succours in the
</p>
<p>men whose duty they pretend to be unqualified obedience.

<p>.... It is when the Government, and the corrupt caste

<p>without even the decency of disguise, the infamous

<p>such an overflowing fullness, and with such glaring

<p>effrontery  that the long patience of the people is
</p>
<p>exhausted, and its credulity can bear no more  it is
</p>
<p>then they turn their eyes to you ! It is your hands they
</p>
<p>would arm to maintain  to perpetuate such oppression !
</p>
<p>It is the Government of arms that is sought to be
</p>
<p>established, in order to force the people to bend to a
</p>
<p>352 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>regime in which it is pretended they can live without
</p>
<p>nourishment, without clothes, without liberty ! And
</p>
<p>they are the fathers, husbands, sons, brothers, kinsmen,
</p>
<p>&c, that our rulers would have impose on  nay, strike
</p>
<p>(should circumstances require it) their children, wives,
</p>
<p>fathers, brothers, sisters, friends, kinsfolk ! &c. And it is
</p>
<p>through you, who are of the people !  you, soldiers of the
</p>
<p>Republic !  who are thus placed in opposition to another
</p>
<p>portion of the people !  it is through you it is sought
</p>
<p>to consolidate this state of bondage, degradation, and
</p>
<p>famine, a thousand times worse than the old servitude
</p>
<p>against wliich we rose in arms six years ago !
</p>
<p>No !  you will not be the vile satellites, the cruel and
</p>
<p>blind instruments of the enemies of the people, and, con
</p>
<p>sequently, of your own enemies ! I repeat, that it is only
</p>
<p>when authority has rendered itself culpable, or wishes to
</p>
<p>aggravate its guilt, that it encompasseth itself with bay
</p>
<p>onets. When power is just, it is always strong enough
</p>
<p>in the people's strength. Capet had fortified himself
</p>
<p>with an army before the 14th of July. . . .We know what
</p>
<p>his designs were, and for what a complication of crimes
</p>
<p>he wanted to secure impunity for himself. Would it be
</p>
<p>wrong to examine whether those who imitate him are not
</p>
<p>influenced by an exact parity of motives ?
</p>
<p>Remember, soldiers, that the army of Capet, though
</p>
<p>trained in the school of monarchic discipline, exhibited a
</p>
<p>noble conduct. It remembered that it was part of the
</p>
<p>people ! The French guards lowering their fasces before
</p>
<p>the sans-culottes was an example which will be handed
</p>
<p>down to the admiration of all ages. Alas! why must
</p>
<p>we remind you of an epoch more recent and less glorious ?
</p>
<p>On the 12th Germinal and on the 1st Prairial batallions

<p>It is true we owe them gratitude for the 13th Vendemiaire,

</p>
<p>wither in presence of the real people, he should make
</p>
<p>exceptions with respect to the gilded sops of luxury, who
</p>
<p>are not the people. But how many Vcndemiaires would
</p>
<p>be necessary to expiate the infamous days of Prairial ?
</p>
<p>In Vendemiaire you vanquished these gilded Do-nothings,
</p>
<p>you made aristocracy and royalism bite the dust. So far
</p>
<p>well. Every blow dealt to these two monster-species is
</p>
<p>useful and worthy of the French armies. But in dealing
</p>
<p>the blow, it is right to have a wise object in view. Is it
</p>
<p>enough to conquer ? No, it is further necessary to turn
</p>
<p>the victory to account. This is what you neglected to
</p>
<p>do in Vendemiaire. We read these words in the address
</p>
<p>of Solignac, which has just appeared under the name of
</p>
<p>the first division of the army of the interior. The men of
</p>
<p>the\3th Vendttmiare combatted for the Government. It
</p>
<p>is a sad truth that, and perhaps the only truth contained
</p>
<p>in that contemptible document. The vile Adjutant Solignac
</p>
<p>was equally worthy of drawing it up, as he was of com
</p>
<p>mitting the forgery of attaching the name of the army
</p>
<p>of the interior to his servile effusion. Yes ! unfortunately
</p>
<p>you combatted and conquered in Vendemiaire only for
</p>
<p>the Government ! You might have rendered the victory
</p>
<p>fruitful and decisive for the people and for yourselves ;
</p>
<p>instead of which, the Government for whom you tri
</p>
<p>umphed has shown you its gratitude by making both the
</p>
<p>people and you worse slaves than you were before. Will
</p>
<p>vou not be' wiser when the like occasion offers again ?
</p>
<p>Will it net be for the people that you will then combat ?
</p>
<p>I cannot believe that this degrading language that these
</p>
<p>grovelling phrases which the dishonoured Solignac has

<p>put into your mouths can express your real sentiments !

<p>of which they have been victims ; forewarned of what

<p>would be their fate if they suffered another defeat, the

</p>
<p>brought all their trickeries into play ; in vain have they
</p>

</p>
<p>succeed. One of their stratagems is to frequently
</p>
<p>renovate the army of the interior. When they fancy that
</p>
<p>disabused by us, you begin to regard us as friends instead
</p>
<p>of enemies, they send you off to a distance ! The columns
</p>
<p>which hold us here, as it were, in a state of siege, are
</p>
<p>continually and almost every hour relieved by other
</p>
<p>columns. To what will all this finessing lead ? Why,
</p>
<p>to this  that all the French armies will come in succes

<p>And I too would desire real equality. I am almost

<p>sixty years old  I have nothing, or almost nothing, in
</p>
<p>the shape of property  I am burdened with six children,
</p>
<p>as yet too young to work  I have the misfortune not to
</p>
<p>know any profession or trade  I am neither merchant,
</p>
<p>nor courtier, nor stockjobber, nor broker, nor even
</p>
<p>clerk in an office. How many pressing motives for de
</p>
<p>siring real equality. But, alas  is it possible ? Of what
</p>
<p>use to show me this blissful state in so remote and ob
</p>
<p>scure a distance, that I despair of ever arriving there ?
</p>
<p>How are we to give it existence? Always the word,
</p>
<p>and never the thing.
</p>
<p>I have read of agrarian divisions of land, but that has
</p>
<p>not endured. The cause of this is what needs to be
</p>
<p>fathomed. It is not a question of new distribution
</p>
<p>merely, but of the durability of such distribution. The
</p>
<p>lands are not all that would require to be newly dis
</p>
<p>tributed ; and I have nowhere read of even the attempt
</p>
<p>being made to distribute the productions of mind and
</p>
<p>invention, except in religious communities, or some such
</p>
<p>establishments. Shall we divide ourselves into small
</p>
<p>communities ? Suppose we do that, and that I bring.
</p>

<p>What a crowd of reflections come to offer themselves

<p>here !
</p>
<p>I hear Jean Jacques Rousseau and Mably quoted on

<p>your side. The first has positively said, that to live
</p>
<p>under a pure democracy we should be demi-gods. The
</p>
<p>second is very far from believing in the possibility of real
</p>
<p>equality in a country so extensive, so considerable, and
</p>
<p>so well peopled as our's. When I think on it, and I
</p>
<p>often think on it, my head loses itself in bewilderment.
</p>
<p>Tribune !  lay us down a plan ; prove to us, in a
</p>
<p>clear manner, the possibility of equality; that such
</p>
<p>equality can be durable; and show us the positive steps

<p>or means of arriving at it, that is to say, that we may
</p>
<p>not continue for years in anarchy; and that, after so

<p>and addressed the 30th Pluviose, to Gracchus
</p>
<p>Babeuf, Tribune of the People.
</p>
<p>" In a veritable society there ought to be neither rich nor poor."
</p>
<p>" The rich who will not renounce their superfluities in favour
</p>
<p>of the indigent are enemies of the people."
</p>
<p>" The end of the Revolution is to destroy inequality, and to
</p>
<p>re-establish the happiness of all."

<p>" Articles 7, 8, and 10 of the Analysis of the Doctrine of the Tribune,
</p>
<p>posted up and proclaimed the &0th of this month of Germinal."
</p>
<p>The following truths, addressed in reply to the author
</p>
<p>of the letter of the 30th Pluviose, ought to have been
</p>
<p>published sooner. I am not sorry, however, that par
</p>
<p>ticular reasons obliged me to wait till now. The. doc
</p>
<p>trine discussed in this paper is more than ever the order
</p>
<p>of the day, and I flatter myself that I shall at present
</p>
<p>attract a reasonable attention to the greatest of all
</p>
<p>subjects which interest man.
</p>
<p>Every true Republican ought to rejoice at the doubts
</p>
<p>advanced by the Citizen M.V., as to the possibility of
</p>
<p>executing the system of real equality. If the contest
</p>
<p>engaged in, touching this supreme point of human re
</p>
<p>generation, be supported by the friends of liberty with
</p>
<p>the same warmth of zeal which they recently evinced in
</p>
<p>demolishing the scaffolding of feudality and monarchy,
</p>
<p>it is beyond doubt certain that we shall soon witness the
</p>
<p>fall of the barbarous system of private properties, and,
</p>
<p>as a consequence, the re-establishment on earth of the
</p>
<p>happiness of the Golden Age, and of practical fraternity,
</p>
<p>which ambition and avarice have hitherto entirely ba
</p>
<p>nished from our monstrous societies.
</p>
<p>Generous souls!  you who launched into the revo

<p>tyrannies  individual riches. The doctrine we preach
</p>
<p>has in support of it the cool calculations of philosophy,
</p>
<p>and the authority of some of the greatest men of an
</p>
<p>tiquity and of our own age. It alone offers a reasonable
</p>
<p>boundary to the revolution which would be a crime, if
</p>
<p>in changing the mere form of oppression it left the mul-
</p>
<p>babeuf's conspiracy. 365
</p>
<p>titude in misfortunes and servitude, aggravated by the
</p>
<p>false hope of mitigation, and consolidated by the in
</p>
<p>creased number and perversity of its oppressors.
</p>
<p>Before touching on the proofs of the possibility, of the
</p>
<p>justice, and of the charms of the system of real equality,
</p>
<p>in answer to the doubts of M.V., we must set him
</p>
<p>right on a question which he seems to misunderstand,
</p>
<p>when, after speaking of the division of lands, he adds,
</p>
<p>" the difficulty of the question regards not merely the
</p>
<p>division of lands, but to provide that such division be
</p>
<p>durable." Nothing of the kind. The system of equality excludes
</p>
<p>all division. Nay, it is to this very division, that our
</p>
<p>societies  the offspring of the wants, passions, and
</p>
<p>ignorance of our ancestors  owe all the tyrannies and
</p>
<p>all the afflictions of which we are at present the victims.
</p>
<p>Before any of our forefathers could have said that a field
</p>
<p>belonged to him, it was necessary that a convention 
</p>
<p>express or tacit  should have guaranteed him the enjoy
</p>
<p>ment or possession of it. Happy for mankind had that
</p>
<p>fatal convention never taken place ! That convention it
</p>
<p>was which first introduced into the social state the dis
</p>
<p>astrous consequences of force and cunning, of which
</p>
<p>there was so much reason to complain in the natural
</p>
<p>state.* That it is which has isolated and divided human
</p>
<p>kind, which has excited their cupidity, and founded upon
</p>
<p>this destructive vice the conservation of societies. That it
</p>
<p>is which has furnished force, cunning, and perversity,
</p>
<p>with the means of evading the natural conditions of the
</p>
<p>social compact, and delivering over simplicity and virtue
</p>
<p>to exhausting labour and penury and sorrow. That it
</p>
<p>-is which has condemned the producers of all wealth to
</p>
<p>every privation, and heaped all manner of luxurious
</p>
<p>enjoyment upon the idle. That it is which has subjected
</p>
<p>the multitude (constrained to be ignorant) to the snares
</p>
<p>of ambition and fanaticism. It is it, in fine, which is

<p>thing to earn his living, nobody would desire to be either
</p>
<p>a monarch, or a noble, or a governor ; 2d, Because it
</p>
<p>is the perfection of perfidy to call men free who, con
</p>
<p>demned to labour to exhaustion, without hoping ever to
</p>
<p>enjoy, are incapacited to make known their feelings and
</p>
<p>sufferings by the want of leisure, and by the constrained
</p>
<p>ignorance in which our social state retains them. Behold
</p>
<p>why nothing is more contrary to equality and to hap
</p>
<p>piness than private property, or the division of lands
</p>
<p>which is its fountain-head.
</p>
<p>Nay, more  this division of lands to which, according
</p>
<p>to some, the maximum of our social happiness is re
</p>
<p>ducible, would aggravate the general evil, inasmuch as
</p>
<p>it would alarm the egoism of our proprietors, which forms
</p>
<p>the only basis of what at present is called public prosperity,
</p>
<p>and open the way to the immediate return of disorders
</p>
<p>of which it is pretended that it would be the remedy.
</p>
<p>Now, let us see what is understood by real equality.
</p>
<p>It has for its basis two essential conditions :  work in
</p>
<p>common ; enjoyment in common.
</p>
<p>In the first place, labour being a necessary condition,
</p>
<p>without which society would perish, nobody can evade
</p>
<p>his share of it without injustice ; the man who has done
</p>
<p>so, has either diminished the public stock of wealth, or
</p>
<p>else thrown his own burden upon his neighbour.
</p>
<p>Two powerful considerations occur in support of this
</p>
<p>system. 1. This common labour would augment the
</p>
<p>riches of society, which in the actual state can count
</p>
<p>upon the useful labour of only a small portion of its
</p>
<p>members. 2. If the general labour were fairly distributed
</p>
<p>amongst all the valid members of society, it would deliver
</p>
<p>from an insupportable burden those whom we have con
</p>
<p>demned exclusively to drudgery, and would transfer to
</p>
<p>the rest only a very moderate portion of labour, which
</p>
<p>would soon become for all a source of pleasure and

</p>
<p> our peasants  on the contrary, far from keeping the
</p>
<p>enjoyment of their productions, and of tasting the hap
</p>
<p>piness of which our civilization gives them the idea, are
</p>
<p>obliged to surrender nearly all to greedy and worthless
</p>
<p>proprietors, and to a certainty, suffer hunger, thirst, and
</p>
<p>the inclemency of the seasons.
</p>
<p>Let each work for the great social family, and let each
</p>
<p>receive in return the means of living and his fair share of
</p>
<p>the general pleasure and happiness. Behold what nature
</p>
<p>wills  behold the state in which equality is not a chimera,
</p>
<p>and in wliich the liberty of each individual is substantially
</p>
<p>assured. You speak, citizen M. V., of the abnegation of all
</p>
<p>tastes, of all penchants, of the equality that would take
</p>
<p>place between the living of an artist and that of a cobbler,
</p>
<p>and of the decay of the fine arts, as so many disastrous
</p>
<p>consequences of the system of real equality, whose ab
</p>
<p>surdity you would thereby prove. The objection only
</p>
<p>proves that you are still enthralled by our old prejudices.
</p>
<p>To suppose that to return to equality would be to become
</p>
<p>savage and brutal, is only to misconceive its constitution.
</p>
<p>To fling in our teeth the scarecrow of abnegations, when
</p>
<p>we wish to put an end to the incalculable and perpetual
</p>
<p>privations of the majority of the people  when we wish
</p>
<p>that the labour of each person should secure him a com
</p>
<p>modious and agreeable existence  is either not to compre
</p>
<p>hend us, or to show oneself the accomplice of those whom
</p>
<p>idleness and hatred of work render the enemies of equality.
</p>
<p>It would, to be sure, be an indescribable horror, my
</p>
<p>dear M. V., that your bread, your meat, your wine,
</p>
<p>and your clothes, should come out of the same magazine
</p>
<p>and have the same taste as those of a cobbler ! But
</p>
<p>then, why did Nature choose to give to this inferior ani
</p>
<p>mal a stomach and senses like yours ? Miserable ! when
</p>
<p>you swim in abundance, do you want in addition the
</p>
<p>picture of another's griefs to complete your happiness ?

<p>The pretended decay of the professions and the fine

<p>clever persons who would have you believe that the
</p>

</p>
<p>the mass of the people, who are utter strangers to the
</p>
<p>advantages of the fine arts, would not experience any
</p>
<p>great inconvenience in consequence. But in truth, no
</p>
<p>such event is to be feared, for it is manifest that the arts
</p>
<p>would receive, in our system of equality, advancements
</p>
<p>of general utility, and a sublime impress conformable to
</p>
<p>the grand sentiments which an immense association of
</p>
<p>happy beings should necessarily give birth to. The
</p>
<p>citizens would be well-fed, well-clothed, well-amused,
</p>
<p>without inequality, without luxury ; the Republic alone
</p>
<p>would be rich, magnificent, all-powerful.
</p>
<p>Some crafts, it is true, whose productions only serve
</p>
<p>to relieve the ennui of a very small portion of parasites,
</p>
<p>and to pump enormous masses of money into their hands,
</p>
<p>should give place to others which would augment the
</p>
<p>well-being of the great mass of society. But where is
</p>
<p>the man who could regret this happy change? The
</p>
<p>sciences and the fine arts once relieved from the goad of
</p>
<p>ever-pressing, ever-crippling want, the man of genius
</p>
<p>would no longer have any other stimulus than the love
</p>
<p>of glory ; and, soon shaking off the yoke of flattery, and
</p>
<p>of selfish Mecsenas-like patrons, his only object would
</p>
<p>be the prosperity of the social body.
</p>
<p>To frivolous poems, to architecture of bad taste, to
</p>
<p>pictures without interest, we should see succeed circuses,
</p>
<p>temples, and sublime porticos, whither the sovereign
</p>
<p>people (at present worse lodged than our brute animals
</p>
<p>are) would repair to imbibe, in the monuments and
</p>
<p>works of philosophy, the doctrine, the example, and the
</p>
<p>love of wisdom.
</p>
<p>In this enchanting system, of whose charms I only
</p>
<p>pretend to sketch the outlines, we should witness the
</p>
<p>solution of the problem  to find a state in which each
</p>
<p>individual might, with the least trouble, enjoy the

<p>most commodious life. Thus the very-diversified pro

<p>ductions of all would belong to the mass, who would
</p>
<p>afterwards distribute them for the greatest happiness of
</p>
<p>each. You see, then, citizen M. V., that it is not pro
</p>
<p>posed to condemn men to abnegations, but, on the con
</p>
<p>trary, to diminish the privations of the mass. You
</p>
<p>ought also to see that in such a state the uprooting of
</p>
<p>avarice, having put an end to jealousies, cunning, and

<p>BABEUF'S CONSPIRACY. 369
</p>
<p>distrusts, men would be really brothers, strictly interested
</p>
<p>in the conservation of an order of things which would
</p>
<p>make the happiness of all.
</p>
<p>It was due to the French Revolution to put in prac
</p>
<p>tical execution the conceptions of philosophy, hitherto
</p>
<p>regarded as chimerical. We have commenced the great
</p>
<p>work ; let us finish it. Were we to stop at the point
</p>
<p>where we now are, humanity and posterity would have
</p>
<p>little to thank us for.
</p>
<p>In order to pass from our present vicious state to the
</p>
<p>one I advocate, it is necessary, 
</p>
<p>1 . To place all the existing wealth of the country in
</p>
<p>the hands of the Republic.
</p>
<p>2. To make all the valid citizens "work, each accord
</p>
<p>ing to his capacity and actual habits.
</p>
<p>3. To utilize the objects of labour, by bringing toge
</p>
<p>ther those which mutually aid one another, and by
</p>
<p>giving a new direction to such as are only the effect of
</p>
<p>the existing stagnant masses of riches.
</p>
<p>4. To bring together (so as to have a continued
</p>
<p>supply) into the pubhc depots all the productions of the
</p>
<p>land and of industry.
</p>
<p>5. To effect an equal distribution of productions and
</p>
<p>enjoyments. 6. To dry up the source of all property, of all indi
</p>
<p>vidual or private commerce, and to substitute for them a
</p>
<p>wise distribution confided to the public authority.
</p>
<p>7. To establish common halls of education, in which
</p>
<p>each individual should be trained to the employment or
</p>
<p>work most suitable to his strength and inclinations.
</p>
<p>Thus egoism would be no longer the spring of action
</p>
<p>or the stimulus to labour for individuals, who, whatever
</p>
<p>the variety and use of their productions, would receive
</p>
<p>the same retribution in food, clothing, &c. &c.
</p>
<p>From this consequence our rich folk elicit the two
</p>
<p>following objections:

</p>
<p>1. The necessity of procuring subsistence, and the
</p>
<p>hope of ameliorating our condition in life are the great
</p>
<p>sources of labour and reproduction; this necessity and
</p>
<p>this hope once destroyed, labour ceases, the spring of
</p>
<p>reproduction is dried up, and society perishes.
</p>
<p>r5
</p>
<p>370 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>2. If every species of labour were to receive the same
</p>
<p>recompence, there would no longer exist any motive for
</p>
<p>pursuing those scientific researches, which produce dis
</p>
<p>coveries useful to society.
</p>
<p>I answer, 1 st, It is easy to make every one understand
</p>
<p>that a few hours' occupation per day would secure to
</p>
<p>every individual the means of living agreeably, and per
</p>
<p>manently relieve him from those anxieties by which we
</p>
<p>are now continually undermined; and surely the man who
</p>
<p>, now slaves himself to exhaustion in order to have a little,
</p>
<p>would work a little in order to have much. Moreover,
</p>
<p>the objection rests entirely upon the disagreeable idea
</p>
<p>we are accustomed to form of labour, which, if wisely
</p>
<p>and universally distributed, would become in our system
</p>
<p>a mild and delightful occupation, of which no person
</p>
<p>would have either the inclination or interest to elude his
</p>
<p>share. 2d. It is, I think, a well ascertained fact that the
</p>
<p>progress of science depends more on the love of glory
</p>
<p>than on the avidity for riches; and in this case, our
</p>
<p>society, truly philosophic, embodying every possible
</p>
<p>means of effectually and impartially honouring its bene
</p>
<p>factors, would have therefore a right to expect more from
</p>
<p>science than our present corrupted associations, in which
</p>
<p>genius and virtue, despised and devoted to indigence,
</p>
<p>have the mortification to behold folly and crime almost
</p>
<p>invariably loaded with riches and honour.
</p>
<p>I have said enough to satisfy my readers in good
</p>
<p>earnest, that the principle of avidity and selfishness,
</p>
<p>which forms the basis of all our present institutions, is
</p>
<p>detestable ; and that to terminate for ever the agitations,
</p>
<p>misfortunes, and tyrannies which divide and oppress us'
</p>
<p>we must replace ourselves in a veritable state of society^
</p>
<p>where each individual, having equal stake and interest^
</p>
<p>may derive an equal profit; for all the reasonings of the
</p>
<p>political economists will never convince men of sense and

<p>honesty that it is supremely just that those who do no
</p>
<p>thing should possess every thing, and chain down, bru
</p>
<p>talize, and maltreat those who doing everything, possess
</p>
<p>almost nothing.
</p>
<p>Citizen M. V. presents as another objection to our
</p>
<p>babeuf's conspiracy. 371
</p>
<p>system of equality  the necessity of a Government, and
</p>
<p>the too large extent of the Republic. The answer is
</p>
<p>obvious. 1st. The persons commissioned to preserve this system,
</p>
<p>the machinery of which is extremely simple, would be
</p>
<p>regarded as workers necessary to the general prosperity ;
</p>
<p>and never being able to obtain more enjoyments than
</p>
<p>the other citizens (too deeply interested in watching
</p>
<p>them) there would be no occasion to fear any attempts
</p>
<p>on their part to retain their authority in contempt of the
</p>
<p>people's will.
</p>
<p>2d. If all the difficulties which prejudices oppose to
</p>
<p>the community of labour and enjoyment in a small state
</p>
<p>or tribe can be easily vanquished, there is nothing to
</p>
<p>prevent the hke result in a great association like the
</p>
<p>Republic of France. In the first place, it is readily con
</p>
<p>ceived how all the citizens might be employed, each in
</p>
<p>his respective locality, and agreeably to the nature of
</p>
<p>the soil. As to the equal distribution of objects of con
</p>
<p>sumption to all the communes of the Republic, or to all
</p>
<p>that might participate in it according to their relations
</p>
<p>with the differerent climates, I cannot see why a wise
</p>
<p>authority, unembarrassed by the obstacles with which
</p>
<p>these sorts of operations are now-a-days thwarted by the
</p>
<p>greedy selfishness of governors and governed, could not
</p>
<p>execute it with far more satisfaction to all the citizens
</p>
<p>than they experience in the actual state of things, aban
</p>
<p>doned, as they frequently are, to scarcity and famine,
</p>
<p>by the crafty calculations of speculators,
</p>
<p>I behold, in the new order of things 
</p>
<p>1. The arts placed, by providential institutions, in
</p>
<p>the localities where they would be most useful ; and, by
</p>
<p>commingling with the agriculturists, working the extinc

<p>tion of those receptacles of every vice, large cities ;
</p>
<p>and covering France with villages, adorned with im

</p>
<p>multiplication there would be nothing to retard.
</p>
<p>2d. Men, enlightened and trained to labour by
</p>
<p>education in common  loving their country more than
</p>
<p>they at present love their families  and deliberating,
</p>
<p>with a knowledge of causes on public affairs  I behold
</p>
<p>them giving to the world the first example of democracy
</p>
<p>372 babeuf's CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>and virtue, defended with the courage of a lion by an
</p>
<p>immense population.
</p>
<p>3d. Frenchmen without money, without privations,
</p>
<p>without ennui, without blue-devils, without the desire of
</p>
<p>amassing against the future  I behold them paying
</p>
<p>cheerfully to their country the common tribute ot all 
</p>
<p>labour; I behold them luxuriating in the pleasures of
</p>
<p>nature, and passing their unoccupied time in the gaieties
</p>
<p>of public festivals, in the discussion of laws, and in the
</p>
<p>instruction of youth.
</p>
<p>4th. Society disenthralled from the litigations, the
</p>
<p>hatreds, the jealousies, and all the disastrous conse
</p>
<p>quences of private property.
</p>
<p>5th. Legislation reduced to a few simple elementary
</p>
<p>principles ; reduced, in fact, to the art of augmenting
</p>
<p>the knowledge and pleasures of society.
</p>
<p>6th. The country, when threatened with danger, able
</p>
<p>to find, in the increase of a half-hour's work per day,
</p>
<p>more soldiers and resources than can, in the present
</p>
<p>order of things, be furnished by all the financiers of
</p>
<p>Europe. Oh, my fellow-countrymen ! contemplate this picture
</p>
<p>of liberty, of peace, of happiness ! Behold the only
</p>
<p>possible remedy for so many distractions, convulsions, and
</p>
<p>factions  evils which must terminate either in universal
</p>
<p>slavery or universal happiness. What, then, are the pow
</p>
<p>erful obstacles to prevent us (upon returning to the ways
</p>
<p>of reason) from putting an end to our mutual jealousies,
</p>
<p>our fierce contests, and our propensities to destroy one
</p>
<p>another ? The stupidity of some, the sloth of others, and
</p>
<p>the vicious habits which have puffed with false pride the
</p>
<p>hearts of those who look cold-bloodedly on the misery of
</p>
<p>their fellow-creatures  the fruit of their baneful opulence
</p>
<p>_  such are the obstacles that mar our progress.

<p> to your writings, it belongs to extirpate selfishness 
</p>
<p>the source of all misery and woe. To truth, in short, it
</p>
<p>belongs to destroy royalism, which, at once the cause
</p>
<p>and effect of monstrous inequality, will ever subsist under
</p>
<p>any and every form of government, until actual equality
</p>
<p>and democracy shall have amalgamated all interests,
</p>
<p>BABEUF S CONSPIRACY. 373
</p>
<p>destroyed all partialities, and divested one portion of
</p>
<p>society of the anti-social faculty of constraining, harassing,
</p>
<p>wounding, and oppressing the remainder.
</p>
<p>If power had no interest in opposing the progress of
</p>
<p>human sociability, I would regard the success of this en
</p>
<p>terprise as certain ; for if we speak clearly and honestly
</p>
<p>to the people, I feel satisfied they will immediately de
</p>
<p>clare themselves for equality. But whereas such state is
</p>
<p>not relished by the vitiated hearts and perturbed imagi
</p>
<p>nations of the powerful, those who will have the courage
</p>
<p>to fulfil their duties towards the mass, must expect, not
</p>
<p>only to be tortured and persecuted in a thousand ways,
</p>
<p>but also to be represented (which already happens) as
</p>
<p>brigands, incendiaries, and royalists. True, it will with
</p>
<p>difficulty be believed that those who have destroyed the
</p>
<p>throne, and who cannot endure any inequality, not even
</p>
<p>that of idleness and riches, can love royalty the maximum
</p>
<p>of inequalities ! But still there will be fools to believe it,
</p>
<p>and therefore the patriots must be prepared to bear with
</p>
<p>fortitude this new indignity; indeed, unless they shall
</p>
<p>make up then minds to risk life itself in defending the
</p>
<p>general good, the Revolution will only appear in the eyes
</p>
<p>of posterity as a blot on history and a crime on them
</p>
<p>selves. It still remains for me to dissipate the last doubt of
</p>
<p>citizen 31. V, who tears anarchy in the transition from
</p>
<p>the existing- system to that of equality.
</p>
<p>Patriots ! join your voices to mine when I exclaim 
</p>
<p>Oh ! fellow citizens, let us cast our gold into the sea 
</p>
<p>let us all work  let us all enjoy  let us banish idleness
</p>
<p>and luxury  and this seductive language, supported by
</p>
<p>the reasons of wisdom, will set reform beyond the reach
</p>
<p>of all the incertitudes, all the alarms which seemingly
</p>
<p>are feared. But were it even true that this transition
</p>
<p>should necessarily involveconvulsiveextravagances(which,

<p>movements), I would only call them the last effects of
</p>
<p>expiring anarchy. For, properly speaking, disorder and
</p>
<p>anarchy do really exist at present in every actual society
</p>
<p>in Europe, where, under divers pretexts, and by different
</p>
<p>means, the population is despoiled of all its rights. And
</p>
<p>surely it would be well worth risking some momentary
</p>
<p>374 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>irregularities, in order to put an end to the present
</p>
<p>grand organized and perpetual anarchy, and to establish
</p>
<p>a system of prosperity which, realizing the predictions ot
</p>
<p>philosophers on the Revolution, would, according to all
</p>
<p>appearances, work the utter demolition of the Govern

<p>A PRESSING WORD TO THE PATRIOTS

<p>address you a few urgent words in haste. Give ear to
</p>
<p>them ; they interest you exceedingly.
</p>
<p>Truth triumphs. All the oppressors are pale. The
</p>
<p>eyes of the people are opened by its friends. The army

<p>BABEUF S CONSPIRACY. 379
</p>
<p>sees also. The torrent of popular energy can be no
</p>
<p>longer restrained by any dyke or bulwark. Our rulers
</p>
<p>have perceived all this, and they have just got upon a
</p>
<p>new tack, in order to escape the fall, the expectation of
</p>
<p>which is our consolation and their despair.
</p>
<p>Within the last ten or twelve days they have dis
</p>
<p>covered that persecution and outrages against citizens of
</p>
<p>the best character, were no longer efficacious arms in
</p>
<p>their hands. They have substituted for them craft and
</p>
<p>disgusting cajoleries. The ferocious wolves have trans
</p>
<p>formed themselves into supple and cautious foxes. Be
</p>
<p>not deceived by it ; they are still and always the same
</p>
<p>carnivorous animals ; they have not changed their nature
</p>
<p>nor their evil will. They caress you to-day, as it were,
</p>
<p>with velvet paws; to-morrow they will devour you if they
</p>
<p>can. Hear me as to the points upon which I wish to put
</p>
<p>you on your guard.
</p>
<p>The emissaries of the Talliens, the Legendres, the
</p>
<p>Barrases, and those honest personages themselves, are
</p>
<p>in a great flutter, and have all their irons at work to
</p>
<p>make you fall into the most abominable of snares ; they
</p>
<p>take advantage of the dispositions you have shown
</p>
<p>against all the culpable authors of your calamities,
</p>
<p>amongst whom they have themselves figured in the first
</p>
<p>rank ; they have the impudence to pretend that they were
</p>
<p>not amongst your oppressors, or, at least, they affect to
</p>
<p>separate themselves from the crew of persecutors who
</p>
<p>marched only as they ordered, and agreeably to their
</p>
<p>instigations. They dare to insinuate that they are now
</p>
<p>ready to constitute themselves avengers of the crimes
</p>
<p>which they themselves committed, or caused to be com
</p>
<p>mitted ! It is of importance to unmask their designs, to
</p>
<p>show you the tendency of their views, and to point out
</p>
<p>the new deep abyss they are digging beneath your feet ;
</p>
<p>but, antecedently, it is necessary to give you a clue to

<p>their intrigues.
</p>
<p>Aux-Fer, and the rest of that crew, have been
</p>
<p>hugging a new set of knaves, of whose names we could
</p>
<p>here give you the complete list ; but for the present we
</p>
<p>content ourselves with signalizing two of them, whose
</p>
<p>acts have been most prominent. Rich. . . . and Soul. . . .
</p>
<p>(the latter calls himself a man of letters) have been for
</p>
<p>380 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>the last few days employed in tampering with the groups
</p>
<p>assembled near the Tuilleries. Admirably do they acquit
</p>
<p>themselves of their mission, which is to excite popular
</p>
<p>effervescence to an extreme point. They there give out,
</p>
<p>to whoever will hear them, that the two councils are,
</p>
<p>without exception, composed of villains  that Barras
</p>
<p>and Carnot are excellent Republicans, most anxious to
</p>
<p>terminate the sufferings of the people, and to save the
</p>
<p>country that there has been, therefore, formed an in
</p>
<p>famous plot to assassinate them  that consequently, it is
</p>
<p>the duty of the people to rally around them and their
</p>
<p>friends, to arm without delay, and to sound the tocsin
</p>
<p>(alarum bell).
</p>
<p>A true Democrat, whom the emissary Rich had
</p>
<p>set upon within the last few days, on the terrace of the
</p>
<p>Tuilleries, in order to inoculate him with his collusory
</p>
<p>ideas, was in the act of hearing Rich 's objections
</p>
<p>touching " the strange precipitation with which it was
</p>
<p>sought to hurry on so important an affair ;" when mean
</p>
<p>while they were interrupted by Legendre, of whom
</p>
<p>Rich .... inquired the news of the day. The butcher
</p>
<p>of Prairial replied, that he did not understand how the
</p>
<p>patriots could follow the instigations of the Tribune of
</p>
<p>the People, who seemed to single out the best patriots,
</p>
<p>such as Barras and Carnot, for his most furious invec
</p>
<p>tives ; that it was necessary to fall vigorously only upon
</p>
<p>the acknowledged workers of mischief, such as Isnard
</p>
<p>and his clique ; that the patriots should unite to anni
</p>
<p>hilate these men; but that the little errors and dif
</p>
<p>ferences they had mutually to reproach one another
</p>
<p>with, ought, for the sake of the common cause, to be
</p>
<p>reciprocally forgotten, &c.
</p>
<p>Close to where this affair took place, another syco
</p>
<p>phant asked a certain other Democrat if he had seen
</p>
<p>such a man who possesses influence over a certain

<p>quarter of Paris, hinting that something good was to be
</p>
<p>communicated to him on the part of Tallien; and the
</p>
<p>intriguer added  " You are a patriot ; you are not an
</p>
<p>" intruder amongst us; the mine must spring in a few
</p>
<p>'* days, the tocsin must be sounded ; I am in quest of

<p> ing "
</p>
<p>babeuf's conspiracy. 381
</p>
<p>The plot is well got up, the bait is not worse laid than
</p>
<p>so many others of which you have been the dupes and
</p>
<p>victims ; but could you possibly be duped on this occa
</p>
<p>sion as on the former ones ? The intentions of the men
</p>
<p>who have never ceased to assassinate, starve, and load
</p>
<p>you with chains, are manifestly these.
</p>
<p>In the first place, to save their guilty heads, upon
</p>
<p>which they see that the grand jury of the people, con
</p>
<p>vinced of their unparalleled and countless crimes, is
</p>
<p>ready to execute the terrible sentence long since pro
</p>
<p>nounced against them. They see no other means of
</p>
<p>accomplishing this than by feigning to throw themselves
</p>
<p>into the arms of the Democrats, whom they flatter them
</p>
<p>selves they will be able the more easily to captivate, by
</p>
<p>persuading them that the people is incompetent to work
</p>
<p>out its own salvation, without the aid of some of the
</p>
<p>parties in authority.
</p>
<p>But through what means are we to suppose them de
</p>
<p>sirous to effect the object of saving their heads ? What
</p>
<p>subsequent intentions are we to credit them for ? Have
</p>
<p>the patriots the simple good nature to suppose it will be
</p>
<p>by frankly serving the democracy, in order to expiate
</p>
<p>the infamy of having destroyed it by proceedings the
</p>
<p>most criminal, and to obtain from them a generous
</p>
<p>pardon on account of this reparation ? Are the patriots
</p>
<p>simple enough to believe that these hypocrites would
</p>
<p>divest themselves of power, of supremacy, and of the
</p>
<p>initiative, during, and after the revolutionary movement,
</p>
<p>with the view of living peaceably under simple demo
</p>
<p>cratic laws, and under the protection of a sacred
</p>
<p>amnesty, awarded them by an indulgent nation ? No,
</p>
<p>no ; that is not their plan ; they have no such inten
</p>
<p>tions. The truth is, these oppressors have perceived
</p>
<p>that the principles of democracy predominate  that
</p>
<p>their throne is tottering  that they have lost all con

<p>fidence  that the true defenders of the people possess
</p>
<p>that confidence entire  that, in short, the question now
</p>
<p>uppermost in the public mind is not whether this or that
</p>
<p>party is to succeed to power, but how the evils are to be
</p>
<p>remedied which the hypocrites have brought upon us.
</p>
<p>Nor must we be foolish enough to believe them, shouM
</p>
<p>they even confess (which they do not) that they are
</p>
<p>382 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>willing to expiate their past wickedness by being them
</p>
<p>selves instrumental in terminating its horrid results.
</p>
<p>No ; we must not suffer these odious beings even to take
</p>
<p>a musket and enter our lines as private soldiers. Were
</p>
<p>the people of France capable of acting otherwise towards
</p>
<p>them, it would be the basest people on earth ; it would
</p>
<p>be ever after unworthy that a single individual of courage
</p>
<p>and wisdom should devote his faculties to the achieve
</p>
<p>ment of liberty.
</p>
<p>Citizens ! attend well to this truth. Fear not so much
</p>
<p>the Royalists in the senate ; they are rather serviceable to
</p>
<p>us than otherwise. Whatever evil they may intend against
</p>
<p>us  we are on our guard against it ; and as to their con
</p>
<p>test with the opposite party, that is useful to us. When
</p>
<p>ever the rulers of a country form but a single party, they
</p>
<p>are always strongest, as against the people. The party
</p>
<p>of the people must put itself in train to vanquish, single-
</p>
<p>handed, both the Royalist party, whose idol is at Verona,
</p>
<p>and the Royalist party, whose idols are at the Luxem
</p>
<p>bourg, without needing the assistance of one or the other.
</p>
<p>It would be folly to pretend to conceal from either our
</p>
<p>hostile intentions under pretence of disarming their vigi
</p>
<p>lance. These intentions are long since known to them,
</p>
<p>and they have tried every means to neutralize and render
</p>
<p>them abortive. No longer able to defeat us by force or
</p>
<p>opinion, behold why they now resort to stratagem. But
</p>
<p>this last resource we will also triumph over. I oppose to
</p>
<p>them not masked but open batteries. The geese, the
</p>
<p>cacklers, the fools of the faction of prudents will say,
</p>
<p>perhaps, that it would be better policy to cover ourselves
</p>
<p>with some disguise. I say, it is absolutely necessary,
</p>
<p>and the time is come, that the mass of the sans-culotte
</p>
<p>army should see the camp, and that its existence can be
</p>
<p>no longer concealed from the enemy. It is no longer by

<p>surprise that we either can or wish to vanquish it  it is

<p>in a manner more worthy of the people  it is by open
</p>
<p>force. Far from us the vile pusillanimity which would
</p>
<p>persuade us that we can do nothing by ourselves, and
</p>
<p>that we shall always need a part of the government to be
</p>
<p>on our side. Governments make revolutions only for
</p>
<p>themselves  only that the governors may always govern.

<p>We, on the contrary, want a real revolution, that will

<p>basis of true democracy. Sans culottes! let us fling
</p>
<p>from us all paltry ideas of mere animadversion against
</p>
<p>certain men ; it is for bread, for ease, for liberty, that we

<p>have kindled the revolutionary flame. Let us not suffer

<p>ourselves to be imposed upon  let not our attention be

<p>diverted from the real object which interests us. I tell

<p>you, I repeat it to you, it is an error to suppose that you

<p>villains, who harass us, have collected a great army here.
</p>
<p>Better still should they augment it ; we shall be only the
</p>
<p>stronger in consequence. The seed has been sown ; the

<p>good doctrine has taken root amongst our enlisted

<p>brethren, who, like us, are of the people, and who have

</p>
<p>The troops arriving to-day, receive lessons from those

<p>who have been before them, and the troops that are

<p>Act of Insurrection.

<p>EQUALITY. LIBERTY.
</p>
<p>GENERAL HAPPINESS.
</p>
<p>The Democrats of France, considering that the op
</p>
<p>pression and misery of the people are at their height 
</p>
<p>that this state of tyranny and woe results from the acts
</p>
<p>of the existing Government ; 
</p>
<p>Considering that the numerous crimes of the governors
</p>
<p>have excited against them the daily-repeated and ever-
</p>
<p>unavailing complaints of the governed; 
</p>
<p>Considering that the Constitution of the people, sworn
</p>
<p>to in 1793, was placed by the people under the safeguard
</p>
<p>of all the virtues ; that, consequently, when the entire
</p>
<p>people has lost all its constitutional guarantees against
</p>
<p>despotism, it belongs to whatever virtues are most cou
</p>
<p>rageous, most intrepid, to take the initiative of insurrec
</p>
<p>tion, and to direct the emancipation of the mass; 
</p>
<p>Considering that the Rights of Man, acknowledged at
</p>
<p>the same epoch (1793), prescribe to the entire people,
</p>
<p>and to each portion of it, as the most sacred of rights
</p>
<p>and the most indispensible of duties, that of rising
</p>
<p>against the Government which violates its rights, and
</p>
<p>that they direct every freeman to instantly put to death

<p>lhose who usurp the sovereignty ;

</p>
<p>Considering that a faction of conspirators has usurped
</p>
<p>BABEUF s CONSPIRACY. 385
</p>
<p>the sovereignty by substituting its own particular will for
</p>
<p>the general will, freely and legally expressed in the
</p>
<p>primary assemblies of 1793, by imposing on the French
</p>
<p>people (under the auspices of persecution and assassina

<p>tion directed against all the friends of liberty) an exe

<p>crable code, called the Constitution of 95, in place of
</p>
<p>the Constitution of 1793, which had been accepted with
</p>
<p>so much enthusiasm ; 
</p>
<p>Considering that the tyrannic code of 95 violates the
</p>
<p>most precious of rights, in that it establishes distinctions
</p>
<p>among the citizens, interdicts them the faculty of sanc
</p>
<p>tioning the laws, of changing the Constitution, and of
</p>
<p>assembling together ; limits their liberty in the choice of
</p>
<p>public agents, and leaves them no guarantee against the
</p>
<p>usurpation of governors ; 
</p>
<p>Considering that the authors of this frightful code
</p>
<p>have maintained themselves in a state of permanent
</p>
<p>rebellion against the people, since they arrogated to
</p>
<p>themselves, in contempt of the sovereign will, an autho
</p>
<p>rity wliich the nation alone could confide ; that they

<p>some, kings, under the disguised name of directors

<p>others, legislators, independent of, and irresponsible to

<p>everything to demoralise the people; after having out

<p>raged, degraded, and proscribed the attributes and in
</p>
<p>stitutions of liberty and democracy; after having caused

<p>the massacre of the best friends of the Republic, restored

<p>and protected its most atrocious enemies, robbed and

<p>exhausted the public treasury, sucked the national re

<p>effectuated the most infamous bankruptcy, delivered over

<p>of the poor, who, for nearly two years, have been slowly
</p>
<p>perishing of hunger ; that, not content with so many
</p>
<p>crimes, they have at length, by an unheard-of refinement
</p>
<p>of tyranny, robbed the people of even the right of com
</p>
<p>plaining ; 
</p>
<p>Considering that they have originated and favoured
</p>
<p>plots to foster civil war in the western departments, in
</p>
<p>386 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>deceiving the nation by a patched-up pacification, whose
</p>
<p>secret articles stipulated conditions contrary to the will,
</p>
<p>to the dignity, to the safety, and to the interests of the
</p>
<p>French people; 
</p>
<p>Considering, that more recently still, they have sur
</p>
<p>rounded themselves with a band of foreigners, and that
</p>
<p>the principal conspirators of Europe are at this moment
</p>
<p>in Paris to consummate the last act of the counter-revo
</p>
<p>lution; 
</p>
<p>Considering that they have just disbanded and treated
</p>
<p>with indignity such of the battalions which have had the
</p>
<p>virtue to refuse being parties to their atrocious designs
</p>
<p>against the people ; that they have had the audacity to
</p>
<p>send to trial those of our brave soldiers who had displayed
</p>
<p>most energy against oppression ; and that to this infamy
</p>
<p>they have added the more execrable one of representing
</p>
<p>their (the soldiers) generous resistance to the will of tyrants,
</p>
<p>as being itself the work of Royalist inspiration ! 
</p>
<p>Considering that it would be difficult and unnecessarily
</p>
<p> tedious to follow up and trace completely the populicidal
</p>
<p>march of this criminal government, whose every thought,
</p>
<p>whose every act is a felony against the nation ; that the
</p>
<p>proofs of all these treasons are traced in characters of
</p>
<p>blood all over the Republic ; that all the departments are
</p>
<p>unanimous in invoking its repression ; that it belongs to
</p>
<p>that portion of the citizens in nearest contact to the
</p>
<p>oppressors to attack oppression ; that this portion is
</p>
<p>accountable to the entire state for the safe protection of
</p>
<p>liberty ; and that too long a silence would render it an
</p>
<p>accomplice of tyranny ; 
</p>
<p>Considering, in fine, that all the defenders of liberty are
</p>
<p>prepared ; 
</p>
<p>After constituting themselves an insurrectional com

<p>the happinsss of all.

<p>bearing the following inscription :

<p>CONSTITUTION OF 1793.
</p>
<p>EQUALITY. LIBERTY.
</p>
<p>GENERAL HAPPINESS.
</p>
<p>Other banners shall bear these words :

</p>
<p>" Those who usurp the sovereignty ought to be put to

</p>
<p>The generals of the people will be distinguished by

<p>their hats.

<p>by the insurgents, wherever they find them.
</p>
<p>6. The barriers and the course of the river shall be

<p>formal and special order of the Insurrectional Committee ;

<p>there shall be free to enter Paris, only the carriers and

<p>conductors of eatables, to whom protection and surety
</p>
<p>will be given.
</p>
<p>7. The people shall take possession of the national

<p>treasury, of the post-office, of the ministers' houses, and
</p>
<p>of every magazine, public or private, containing pro

</p>
<p>the popular authority, shall be dissolved. All the mem

<p>bers composing them shall be immediately judged by the

<p>people. 11. All existing authority, ceasing in presence of that

<p>of the people, no pretended deputy, member of the

<p>usurping government, director, administrator, judge,
</p>
<p>officer, sub-officer of the national guard, or any public

<p>or give any order. Those found contravening this in

<p>ber of the pretended legislative body, or director found

<p>in the streets, shall be arrested and conducted forthwith
</p>
<p>to his ordinary post.
</p>
<p>12. All opposition shall be instantly put down by

<p>force. The parties resisting shall be exterminated. Also
</p>
<p>shall be put to death those who will beat, or cause to be

</p>
<p>will feed and maintain them ; it will do the same towards

<p>whom the existence of the deceased was necessary. The

<p>proscribed patriots in exile throughout the Republic shall

<p>receive all suitable succours and means to enable them
</p>
<p>to return to the bosom of their families. They shall be
</p>

<p>have made a frightful compact with the miscreants we

</p>
<p>You have espoused the interests of the people; you have

<p>scriptive epithets of terrorists, jacobins, seditionists,

<p>of it by the applauses given at the theatres to the words,

<p>Address to the Delegate from the Mountainist Com
</p>
<p>mittee.
</p>
<p>You are aware, citizens, of the efforts of certain De
</p>
<p>mocrats to recover the rights of the people ; you are
</p>
<p>aware that, in the midst of proscriptions and scaffolds,
</p>
<p>we had courage and firmness enough to plead the
</p>
<p>sacred cause of humanity, and that we have persevered
</p>
<p>up to this moment in confronting all dangers, in order to
</p>
<p>form an opposition party against tyranny.
</p>
<p>At the epoch of Vendemiaire, we emerged from our
</p>
<p>dungeons (where we deserved enough from tyranny to
</p>
<p>be buried alive for ever) only to attack it anew ; the
</p>
<p>sacred fire was then extinct ; the mass of the people was

<p>royalized; a portion of the patriots subdued, worn out,
</p>
<p>degenerated in the prisons, found themselves too happy
</p>
<p>in their enlargement to think of aught else ; nay, pre
</p>
<p>viously to their discouragement, they were disposed to
</p>
<p>make terms with an atrocious and usurped Government
</p>
<p>to serve it even, and to accept its plans and condi

<p>tions. If some few men, still worthy of liberty, repre
</p>
<p>sented to them the dishonour and disgrace of such a
</p>
<p>compromise, the greater number excused themselves by
</p>
<p>something still more disgraceful ; they said, they had a
</p>
<p>mental reservation, and that if they fraternized with
</p>
<p>their enemies, it was only the better to surprise their con
</p>
<p>fidence, so that, when strong enough, they might be
</p>
<p>able to overwhelm and extinguish them.
</p>
<p>Such conduct was unpalatable to us. We desired to
</p>
<p>infuse a sort of chivalrous honour into the war of virtue
</p>
<p>against crime. Front to front we attacked the latter ;
</p>
<p>we gained over the waverers ; we induced the Repub

</p>
<p>them to their primitive dignity; we unroyalized the
</p>
<p>people also ; we disabused them of the false opinion by
</p>
<p>which the villains had induced them to believe that their
</p>
<p>then deplorable condition was the result of the Repub
</p>
<p>lican system ; we succeeded in demonstrating to them,
</p>
<p>that, on the contrary, it was the result of the atrocious
</p>
<p>reminiscences of royalism, and of the decay of the Re
</p>
<p>publican edifice, which, if it had been completed, would
</p>
<p>procure them the maximum of happiness. Well, we
</p>
<p>had the advantage of bringing about the end sought by
</p>
<p>this tuition  that of disposing the patriots and the mass
</p>
<p>of the people to overthrow the existing tyrannic Govern
</p>
<p>ment, in order to substitute for it one more worthy of
</p>
<p>the great Revolution which the French have had the
</p>
<p>courage to undertake.
</p>
<p>We have felt that revolutionary journals are not suffi
</p>
<p>cient to conduct us to our end. It is now several months
</p>
<p>since we found it to be our duty to form ourselves into a
</p>
<p>committee of several courageous Democrats ; to organize
</p>
<p>ourselves insurrectionally, and to organize around us all
</p>
<p>the elements necessary to consummate a successful in
</p>
<p>surrection. We have done much to effect that purpose. We
</p>
<p>think we have" brought together the greater part of the
</p>
<p>requisite materials, and made nearly all the arrangements
</p>
<p>essential to such object.
</p>
<p>We have information as to the places where ammu
</p>
<p>nition and arms are to be found, and as to the means of
</p>
<p>getting possession of them.
</p>
<p>We have lists of the patriots ; of all the men of cha
</p>
<p>racter in Paris ; we have the means of effecting a simul
</p>
<p>taneous rising of the people at the first signal.
</p>
<p>We have more  we have an organization of civil and
</p>
<p>military agents fully prepared to act. We have printed
</p>
<p>at length the manifesto of our insurection.
</p>
<p>In short, the insurrection was ready to burst forth,

</p>
<p>when certain information we received, and observations
</p>
<p>we caused to be made, led us to some serious reflections.
</p>
<p>It is our duty to address you in perfect frankness.
</p>
<p>We had resolved, in making this insurrection, to dis
</p>
<p>pense with everything which had belonged to the different
</p>
<p>National Assemblies. Strangers to all factions, working
</p>
<p>s5
</p>
<p>394 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>only for the people, we had considered it to be of prime
</p>
<p>importance to keep aloof from our new Government
</p>
<p>everything which might, by reviving former passions
</p>
<p>or prejudices, prove prejudicial to the people's complete
</p>
<p>regeneration. You will excuse us, citizens, for expressing to you cer
</p>
<p>tain truths somewhat strongly  you will ascribe them to
</p>
<p>our extreme frankness. We upbraided the Mountainists
</p>
<p>with not having fully discharged their duty in the mission
</p>
<p>entrusted to them by the people. We reproached them for
</p>
<p>not having died in support of the people's rights rather
</p>
<p>than submit to see them trampled on. We were further
</p>
<p>apprehensive that in calling them once more to the helm
</p>
<p>of affairs, we should witness the revival of quarrels and
</p>
<p>distracting recriminations  the natural fruits of the old
</p>
<p>points of dispute  the leaven of which still exists in the
</p>
<p>heads of the majority of them. In a word, we persuaded
</p>
<p>ourselves that we could do all and better without them
</p>
<p>than with them.
</p>
<p>We fancy, however, that within the last few days, we
</p>
<p>have acquired, if not a positive proof, at least a very
</p>
<p>strong presumption of the contrary, and besides, we are
</p>
<p>tender how we risk the ruin of the country. Several over
</p>
<p>tures have been made to us, in which we have been told
</p>
<p>that, labouring on your side in the same views and objects
</p>
<p>as ourselves, you are most anxious to form a coalition
</p>
<p>with us for the common object.
</p>
<p>We are determined to accept this proposition, and the
</p>
<p>more readily, inasmuch as we have been fearful lest your
</p>
<p>measures and ours might reciprocally clash with and mar
</p>
<p>one another ; and lest (since we must speak it) you might
</p>
<p>obstruct our projects at the decisive moment, and lest, on
</p>
<p>the arrival of different companies of the people's de
</p>
<p>fenders on the ground, they might feel no disposition to
</p>
<p>harmonize together, but, on the contrary, add a civil
</p>

</p>
<p>sequences likely to result from it, have filled us with

<p>alarm. We have resolved to prevent them, by accepting

<p>your proffered coalition. We have invited you, for the

<p>purpose of transmitting to you this decision. Most

</p>
<p>desirous are we that it may prove agreeable to you, and
</p>
<p>that we may come to a good mutual understanding ; that
</p>
<p>we may effectively concentrate and combine our means
</p>
<p>to save the people, and rescue it from tyranny ; let us
</p>
<p>forget everything in order to attain this happy end.
</p>
<p>PIECE, No. XIX.
</p>
<p>The Directory of Public Safety to the Agents of the
</p>
<p>Twelve Arrondissements.
</p>
<p>Citizens !  Never was conspiracy holier than ours,
</p>
<p>whether we regard its motives or its end. Neither was
</p>
<p>there ever a conspiracy whose agents showed themselves
</p>
<p>so worthy of the confidence of which they were made
</p>
<p>the sacred depositaries. Never did conspirators labour
</p>
<p>in secret against a perfidious Government so long and
</p>
<p>so successfully as we have done. In vain has its restless
</p>
<p>vigilance racked itself, and exhausted every resource of
</p>
<p>inquisition the most atrocious ; not one material proof
</p>
<p>has it yet been able to obtain against us.
</p>
<p>This result does honour to our choice of you, and
</p>
<p>gives us the strongest guarantee for a confidence still
</p>
<p>greater, if possible, than that already reposed in you.
</p>
<p>With men of your stamp, we need to practice no
</p>
<p>reserve. What is engraven in our hearts ought to be
</p>
<p>equally famihar to you as to ourselves, and we owe you
</p>
<p>the truth complete and entire.
</p>
<p>For some days past our correspondence with you is
</p>
<p>Jess active on our part The tone of it is less firm, less
</p>
<p>decided, more vacillating, than it has hitherto been. A
</p>
<p>sort of negligence, of languor, of incertitude, must have
</p>
<p>been visible to you in our movements. At what a time,
</p>
<p>however!  at a time when, apparently, our vigour ought
</p>
<p>to have been redoubled, whilst the patriots and the mass
</p>
<p>of the people called aloud for battle, and that circum
</p>
<p>stances appeared to offer them many chances of gaining
</p>
<p>it. This communication will put you in a condition to

</p>
<p>pronounce whether our conduct is not justifiable not-
</p>
<p>396 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>withstanding. If we cannot justify it, it is the duty of
</p>
<p>you, and of the patriots you direct, to throw all the
</p>
<p>blame on us, and even to punish us for the non-fulfil
</p>
<p>ment of our mission.
</p>
<p>We might content ourselves with telling you, that in
</p>
<p>considering our means of attack, we had well-grounded
</p>
<p>reasons for believing them inadequate, and that we,
</p>
<p>therefore, felt it our duty to suspend a patriotic out
</p>
<p>break, which might only prove the signal of extermina
</p>
<p>tion to the Democrats ; and the more strongly, because
</p>
<p>the terrible lessons of Germinal and Prairial ought to be
</p>
<p>constantly before the eyes of Republicans, and that only
</p>
<p>one more similar lesson was required to ruin them for
</p>
<p>ever. But this is not the only consideration that stopped us.
</p>
<p>We know that in an insurrection we must be daring 
</p>
<p>we must be (to so speak) more than rash. Behold
</p>
<p>the principal cause of the apparent slowness on our
</p>
<p>side. You know we are all desirous that this insurrection
</p>
<p>should be the last  that it should, in fact, constitute the
</p>
<p>happiness of the people. It was accordingly our duty
</p>
<p>to take every precaution capable of assuring this result.
</p>
<p>We have wished that the manifesto proclaiming it
</p>
<p>should guarantee as the first benefit  as a simple pre
</p>
<p>liminary step to the state of felicity we propose for the
</p>
<p>people ; we have willed, we say, that this manifesto
</p>
<p>should guarantee, in the first place, the distribution
</p>
<p>amongst the unhappy poor of the property of all the
</p>
<p>conspirators ; that in the next, it should declare that
</p>
<p>the unhappy poor would be lodged, and provided with
</p>
<p>furniture, in the houses of the conspirators, &c. &c.
</p>
<p>In order that these, and other equally advantageous
</p>
<p>changes, may be executed, we must assure ourselves
</p>
<p>that the power, in passing from the hands of the villains
</p>
<p>who now hold it, shall fall into those of true, pure and
</p>
<p>absolute Democrats  of men of the people of the

<p>people's friends, par excellence. How are they to get
</p>
<p>hold of this power ? Behold the difficulty which has
</p>
<p>stopped, and still stops, us. It is the discussion of this
</p>
<p>ticklish point which has forced us to let several oppor

<p>cious to us, and probably determined in our favour the
</p>
<p>success of the battle we have to fight.
</p>
<p>To gain the battle is nothing, unless we can make
</p>
<p>sure of profitting by the victory. Behold why we had
</p>
<p>printed a first manifesto to the number of thirty thousand
</p>
<p>copies, in which we had laid it down that the Directory
</p>
<p>of Public Safety would substitute for the existing tyran
</p>
<p>nical authority a national assembly, composed of one
</p>
<p>member for each department, chosen from amongst the
</p>
<p>most energetic and tried Democrats, of whom the Direc
</p>
<p>tory would itself furnish the list to be approved by the
</p>
<p>people. This assembly, acting in concert with the Insur
</p>
<p>rectional Directory, would have been charged to finish
</p>
<p>the Revolution, and to assure the well-being of all.
</p>
<p>Numerous considerations subsequently lea us to be
</p>
<p>lieve that we should augment our strength and chances
</p>
<p>of success by recalling the proscribed deputies of the old
</p>
<p>Mountain, who had no share in violating the Constitution
</p>
<p>of 1793, and who owed to violence alone the loss of their
</p>
<p>seats in the Assembly. We considered that, in the eyes
</p>
<p>of the democratic party, these Mountainists constituted
</p>
<p>the legal authority, which the people had not superseded,
</p>
<p>and which, consequently, did then exist. We did not,
</p>
<p>however, dissemble that this section of the Convention
</p>
<p>alists was almost as culpable and ruinous to our cause as
</p>
<p>the rest; in the first place, for having, after the 9th
</p>
<p>Thermidor, permitted and taken part in the counter
</p>
<p>revolutionary reaction ; for having allowed the democratic
</p>
<p>edifice to be demolished piecemeal, and without oppo
</p>
<p>sition ; for not having sounded the alarm on the 5th
</p>
<p>Messidor, when the infamous Boissy D'Anglas appeared
</p>
<p>in the Tribune, and obtained the adoption of his populi-
</p>
<p>cidal code ; for having afterwards had the cowardice not
</p>
<p>to protest aloud against this execrable treason ;* in fine,
</p>
<p>for having had the egregious baseness to accept (the

</p>
<p>usurpation and oppression. But powerful reasons, which
</p>
<p>we will hereafter explain to you and to the people, had
</p>
<p>obliged us to close our eyes for a moment to these cir
</p>
<p>cumstances, and to make great sacrifices of feeling, in

</p>
<p>order to secure the aid of men, without whom we felt it
</p>
<p>would be perhaps impossible to rescue the country from
</p>
<p>the unbearable slavery it endures. We had come, then,
</p>
<p>to the resolution to make use of them, but we had, at
</p>
<p>the same time, taken measures to secure the people
</p>
<p>against retailing under a new tyranny in their hands.
</p>
<p>We had agreed to re-establish the less corrupt remnant
</p>
<p>of the Convention that is to say, the proscribed party
</p>
<p>(to the number of about 68 members) ; and to raise a
</p>
<p>counterpoise to their ambition by uniting to them a new
</p>
<p>body, composed of one Democrat from each department,
</p>
<p>and whose election, made by us and the people in insur
</p>
<p>rection, would present an opposition-front of more than
</p>
<p>one hundred Democrats of the most energetic and decided
</p>
<p>stamp; moreover, to retain, up to the moment when the
</p>
<p>entire people should be placed in secure possession of
</p>
<p>tranquility and prosperity, the title and authority of
</p>
<p>Insurrectional Committee of Public Safety.
</p>
<p>To this effect had we stipulated with the ex-Moun-
</p>
<p>tainists ; they had accepted all our conditions, and pro
</p>
<p>mised to aid us with all their means. We had, in
</p>
<p>consequence, printed 50,000 copies of a fresh manifesto,
</p>
<p>and were taking measures to put it in immediate execu
</p>
<p>tion. Would you believe it, citizens ? These Conven
</p>
<p>tionalists have altered their mind, and have come to tell
</p>
<p>us that they will give the patriots no guarantee against
</p>
<p>their foreseen tyranny ; they have come to tell us that they
</p>
<p>would no longer consent to the adjunction to their body
</p>
<p>of one Democrat from each department  that is to say,
</p>
<p>they demand the destruction of one despotism only to
</p>
<p>put another in its place  to overthrow the existing op
</p>
<p>pression in order to set up their own !
</p>
<p>In support of their pretensions they urge the most

<p>to subvert the dominion of robbers, only that we may
</p>
<p>the better establish that of the people on a durable
</p>
<p>foundation. Behold, my friends, a frank explanation of the causes
</p>
<p>of our delay. We are still at the same point. These
</p>
<p>honest Mountainists hold us in check, and, whether from
</p>
<p>ambition or pride, they seem to care little if, whilst they
</p>
<p>babeuf s conspiracy. 399
</p>
<p>are disputing about terms, the country is exposed to
</p>
<p>eternal perdition. It is unfortunate, we repeat, that
</p>
<p>circumstances, which we cannot just now explain to you,
</p>
<p>place us in the condition of not being able to dispense
</p>
<p>with them. The conclusion of this letter is to inform
</p>
<p>you that if we can, we shall, nevertheless, dispense with
</p>
<p>them, and that if we cannot, we must only direct the
</p>
<p>people in such manner as to prevent the evil which they
</p>
<p>(the Mountainists) might still cause us ; in a manner, to
</p>
<p>oppose to their ambition, in despite of them, the counter
</p>
<p>poise they reject.
</p>
<p>The people accuses us of inactivity. How lamentable
</p>
<p>that we cannot apprise them, as we do you, of what
</p>
<p>obstructs us ! Our popular writers could not do it with
</p>
<p>out compromising matters of the last importance. In
</p>
<p>this position  a most painful one for us  do you at least
</p>
<p>undeceive the patriots, not by transmitting to them all
</p>
<p>the particularities which we have just now communicated
</p>
<p>in exclusive confidence to you, but by assuring them that
</p>
<p>their leaders merit their continued trust, and by exhorting
</p>
<p>them to be patient, and to sustain their energy, which,
</p>
<p>in one way or another, will be released in a very few
</p>
<p>days from further restraint.
</p>
<p>Die or vanquish is the word. Better, fai better, to
</p>
<p>perish in a glorious struggle than to await assassination
</p>
<p>in one of the thousand ways which our tyrants employ,
</p>
<p>and will employ against us.
</p>
<p>Wait, then, in steady expectation of the decisive mo
</p>
<p>ment. Be not alarmed one way or the other  whether
</p>
<p>you will see the remnant of the Mountain ranged on our
</p>
<p>side, or otherwise ; but bear in mind that one of the
</p>
<p>most important instructions is to surround the Insur

</p>
<p>at the moment when it may present itself at the sitting

</p>
<p>this moment that the Mountainists give way to the press

<p>The Author of the Letter of Franc-Libre to his

<p>Republican Brothers of the Executive Directory .
</p>
<p>Brother Republicans !  I have received, with in
</p>
<p>expressible pleasure, the instructions and commission of
</p>
<p>secondary agent, which your confidence has entrusted
</p>
<p>to me, through the medium of our brother, D. T. H.
</p>
<p>I hope soon to justify the opinion you have conceived of
</p>
<p>me ; if not by my talents, at least by my zeal, my con
</p>
<p>stancy, my courage, and, above all, my discretion.
</p>
<p>To the particular knowledge I have of Paris, where I
</p>
<p>have resided eight years, I unite that, more valuable
</p>
<p>still, of the military spirit, which I have studied in all its
</p>
<p>bearings, as a Government agent, during seven years,
</p>
<p>and essentially during- the campaigns of the present war.
</p>
<p>It is in consequence of this practical experience that I
</p>
<p>have felt it my duty to draw up the following reflections,
</p>
<p>which I submit to your wisdom.
</p>
<p>It is a real delusion to suppose that the same stimulants
</p>
<p>which operated the insurrection of the military corps in

<p>slave than he is now-a-days, it is true ; but he knew
</p>
<p>that he was a slave, because the contrary was never pre
</p>
<p>tended to him, and because his officers neglected no
</p>
<p>means to remind him of it ; the immense distance there
</p>
<p>was between them and him made the latter too acutely
</p>
<p>feel his degradation. The consequence was, that in
</p>
<p>1789 the soldier embraced the popular cause, far less
</p>
<p>from love of liberty and equality, of which he could then
</p>
<p>have only a confused idea, than from the inveterate
</p>
<p>hatred he bore towards his officers  a hatred whose
</p>
<p>explosion was terrible, in proportion as it had been long
</p>
<p>pent up. This hatred, this leaven, was then, if not the
</p>
<p>only one, at least the most powerful spring which moved
</p>
<p>our armies to insurrection ; and this truth is too evident
</p>
<p>to be contested.
</p>
<p>To-day the case is altogether different ; except in the
</p>
<p>superior grades alone, the great mass of officers is com
</p>
<p>posed of men formerly privates, who have only their pay
</p>
<p>to live upon, which is reduced, for a chief of battalion,
</p>
<p>to about eight effective sous per day, which obliges the
</p>
<p>major part of them, captains and others, to eat at the
</p>
<p>same mess with the privates, and consequently to con
</p>
<p>tract the most intimate familiarity with them.
</p>
<p>This equality of misery between the soldier and his
</p>
<p>officer produces a friendship, an attachment, and a
</p>
<p>mutual confidence the reverse of what existed before 89.
</p>
<p>The result is, that the soldier, accustomed, like all men,
</p>
<p>to judge of his condition by comparing it with that of
</p>
<p>others, finds, in respect of his officers, too small a dif
</p>
<p>ference between them and him to be envious or jealous ;
</p>
<p>and the officer, who is fooled by the hope of an ap
</p>
<p>proaching better lot, makes the private participate in

<p>this chimerical expectation, which mutually consoles and
</p>
<p>sets both to sleep in a sort of lethargic stupor, Besides,
</p>
<p>the existing civil state offers to the majority of military
</p>
<p>men a still worse condition than their present one, as
</p>
<p>foot soldiers  a circumstance which, in no small degree,
</p>
<p>contributes to keep them servilely under the yoke.
</p>
<p>But, it will be said, how is it that amongst the officers,
</p>
<p>402 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>who are not all automatons, there are not some few to
</p>
<p>open the eyes of their comrades ? How ! the reason is
</p>
<p>simple ; all whom real love of liberty, and that alone,
</p>
<p>had induced to take arms, have, as far as they were
</p>
<p>able, withdrawn from the service since the 9th Thermidor
</p>
<p>that is to say, since the overthrow of the cause they
</p>
<p>had undertaken to defend. The impossibility of retiring
</p>
<p>had made some still remain ; but the Executive Direc
</p>
<p>tory, which will have no soldiers not essentially slaves,
</p>
<p>has made these latter retire, by its decree of the 6th
</p>
<p>instant, on the new organization of the army. The result
</p>
<p>must, therefore, be that we shall have henceforward for
</p>
<p>officers, only those vile beings destitute of fortune, of
</p>
<p>talents and resources, who, moreover, grown old in
</p>
<p>slavery, will be incapable of disobeying, through fear of
</p>
<p>losing their epaulettes, which they regard as the ne plus
</p>
<p>ultra of their possible good fortune ; only those crea
</p>
<p>tures, in short, who, under the reign of kings, thought
</p>
<p>themselves honoured in carrying worsted lace on their
</p>
<p>sleeves, and in the privilege of striking the privates with
</p>
<p>the flat of their swords. Behold a just description of
</p>
<p>the officers who alone are relished by the existing
</p>
<p>Government. As to the soldiers in genera!, they are no longer those
</p>
<p>ardent defenders of liberty we had in 1792 and 1793.
</p>
<p>The major part of those brave fellows have fallen on the
</p>
<p>bed of honour ; the mass of what remain is composed
</p>
<p>of country recruits, who serve liberty as convicts serve at
</p>
<p>the galleys. In a battalion of four hundred men you can
</p>
<p>seldom find forty privates who know anything of reading
</p>
<p>and writing. The youth of our towns, who are some
</p>
<p>what better informed, have almost all contrived to escape
</p>
<p>from the service. The only aspiration of most of the
</p>
<p>soldiers (who, ridiculously enough, are called volunteers)
</p>
<p>is to return in all speed to their firesides ; and I can
</p>
<p>vouch for it, there are thousands of them who care so

<p>little about the Revolution, that they would willingly
</p>
<p>barter the Republic for one of their village-cakes. But
</p>
<p>to make amends, we have, on the other hand, about a
</p>
<p>third, who, being soldiers by trade, and destined to be so,
</p>
<p>no matter under what regime, are fit instruments for any
</p>
<p>and every purpose, when one knows how to employ
</p>
<p>babeuf's conspiracy. 403
</p>
<p>them ; of these the greater part are fool-hardy hot-brains
</p>
<p>who always carry along the timid and apathetic by their
</p>
<p>ascendant audacity. To put these men in motion, it is
</p>
<p>not fine or long speeches that are wanted ; wine, and
</p>
<p>the hope of pillage, are sufficient. These are what they
</p>
<p>best understand, and without them you must expect no
</p>
<p>thing. The Convention knew right well the virtues of
</p>
<p>this recipe, and right well it used it on the 1 3th Vende
</p>
<p>miaire. The cavalry, in general, is of the class I have just
</p>
<p>described to you, more especially the dragoons, hussars,
</p>
<p>ai.d chasseurs.
</p>
<p>After these observations, I proceed to trace the means
</p>
<p>which, in my opinion, it would be expedient to employ
</p>
<p>to operate the general resurrection desired.
</p>
<p>1st, To vigorously undermine the generals and their
</p>
<p>staffs, but to spare the subaltern officers. 2dly, To pro
</p>
<p>voke, if not the disorganization of the forces, at least the
</p>
<p>utmost possible relaxation of their discipline, in order the
</p>
<p>better to operate their dissolution afterwards, if necessary.
</p>
<p>3dly, To speak at once of pillaging the rich, and of
</p>
<p>absolute disbanding (you will easily know how to evade
</p>
<p>your promises afterwards, as circumstances turn out) ;
</p>
<p>not, however, to speak too much of absolute equality,
</p>
<p>for their chiefs (Chouans as they are) have long since
</p>
<p>fortified the minds of the soldiery against that system, to
</p>
<p>the degree that they not only deem it impossible, but in
</p>
<p>general think it a certain mark whereby to recognise the
</p>
<p>Royalists. This will appear strange, but it is not the less
</p>
<p>true notwithstanding. And 4th, and lastly, when the
</p>
<p>grand day of operation arrives, it would, in my opinion,
</p>
<p>be of most essential use to establish balls or dancing
</p>
<p>parties in the tea-gardens in the vicinity of the barracks,
</p>
<p>whither the soldiers might be attracted, and then, by
</p>
<p>plying them with lush, we might artfully work up their
</p>
<p>spirits to the proper pitch of exaltation.

<p>Franc-Libre to the Secret Directory, $c. Sec.
</p>
<p>For three decades (thirty days) I had laboured in
</p>
<p>vain to find a brother amongst my comrades of the camp
</p>
<p>of Grenelle. I already began to despair of success, when
</p>
<p>a lucky chance procured me one who is of the sort to soon
</p>
<p>procure me other and more substantial ones.
</p>
<p>Here is the fact.
</p>
<p>I passed some hours yesterday after dinner drinking
</p>
<p>over a bottle with Montion (that is his name) lieutenant
</p>
<p>of my battalion (a man of oratorical and military abilities,
</p>
<p>and an old Flemish soldier.) I had long before surmised
</p>
<p>that his principles were good, and it was to sound him that
</p>
<p>I took him aside. After a long talk on politics in general,
</p>
<p>and after making him drink enough to make him speak
</p>
<p>(for he is naturally very discreet), he owned to me, in
</p>
<p>that sort of heartfelt effusion which is a certain sign of
</p>
<p>frankness, that he had never ceased to be a Democrat ;
</p>
<p>but that he had lost the hope of seeing the Republicans
</p>
<p>So soon lift their heads again, and that, in consequence,
</p>
<p>he, and several of his old Flemish friends, making a
</p>
<p>virtue of necessity, affected to appear Government-men.

</p>
<p>I seized this opportunity to arouse his courage; and
</p>
<p>avowing to him that I professed the same political creed
</p>
<p>as himself, I gave him to understand that I knew, for a
</p>
<p>positive fact, that more than forty thousand sans-culottes
</p>
<p>were ready to rise, and that they would have already
</p>
<p>overthrown the tyrants, had they not apprehended the
</p>
<p>finding themselves in the necessity of combatting u 
</p>
<p>us, soldiers of the Government. I added, that every
</p>
<p>thing presaged an immediate insurrection notwithstand
</p>
<p>ing, and that to a dead certainty we should be victimized,
</p>
<p>like the Swiss on the 10th of August. I said no more,
</p>
<p>but that sufficed to produce an understanding between us.
</p>
<p>1st, That he would see, to-day, three of his old friends,
</p>
<p>whom he knew at bottom, and would engage them to
</p>
<p>join him in preparing the troops to second the people at
</p>
<p>the decisive moment ; he will enable me to know his
</p>
<p>friends, without letting them know me ; he will tell them
</p>
<p>(an enssential point) and assure them that there are
</p>
<p>already three hundred gained over, but that it is agreed
</p>
<p>that they shall be known to one another only in parties
</p>
<p>of four and four, in order to avoid the effects of treason ;
</p>
<p>At a rough guess, the number may mount up to fifteen
</p>
<p>or twenty, of whom three only are officers (for it is the
</p>
<p>least accessible grade.) When this little nucleus is
</p>
<p>formed, I shall get transmitted to each of them about a
</p>
<p>thousand francs in assignats to gain the soldiers, and to
</p>
<p>spread insubordination. The way I shall get this money
</p>
<p>(for money, I take it, is the grand lever) is this  1st, I
</p>
<p>have in the hands of one of my brothers, at Abbeville,
</p>
<p>thirty-five thousand livres in assignats ; these will soon
</p>
<p>be here, for a letter is already despatched for them. 2d,
</p>
<p>I have a cousin-german, named Ponticourt, a notary in
</p>
<p>the street Sainte- Croix de la Bretonnerie, whom I
</p>
<p>rarely see, because he is very rich, and consequently a
</p>
<p>great royalist ; he has often offered to advance me money

<p>to equip me better than I am now equipped, for, as he
</p>
<p>says, I have more the air of a sans-culotte than of a
</p>
<p>captain ; I have always despised his offers, as I do his
</p>
<p>person, without however breaking or quarrelling with
</p>
<p>him, out of a certain regard to his father, &c. &c. I will
</p>
<p>go find this cousin  I will tell him that I have just got a

<p>place in the War-office  and will ask him to lend me ten

</p>
<p>duty which the insurgent section owes to the entire

<p>to remove from the enemies of equality all pretext for
</p>
<p>calumniating the Parisian people ;

<p>Decrees as follows : 
</p>
<p>Art. 1. The usurpation and tyranny of the members
</p>
<p>of the two councils, and of the Executive Directory, are
</p>
<p>evident. The law* punishes with death the usurpers of
</p>
<p>the popular sovereignty.
</p>
<p>2. A commission, appointed by the insurgent people,
</p>
<p>sits in judgment on the aforesaid individuals.
</p>
<p>3. This commission conducts its proceedings in pre
</p>
<p>sence of the people ; after having heard the Insurrec
</p>
<p>tional Committee, or the accuser named by it, it pro
</p>
<p>nounces whether there are grounds for recommending
</p>
<p>the delinquent to the mercy of the people.
</p>
<p>4- The insurgent people convened by sections, and in
</p>
<p>the form to be pointed out, accords or refuses the mercy
</p>
<p>demanded. 5. Such and such citizens actual members of the
</p>
<p>two councils, are worthy of the people's confidence ; they
</p>
<p>are placed under its special protection.
</p>
<p>6. For the purpose of accelerating the punishment of
</p>
<p>traitors, each agent of arrondissment names and pre
</p>
<p>sents to the acceptation of the assembled people four
</p>
<p>citizens per section.
</p>
<p>7. The commission is divided into six sections ; each
</p>
<p>section pronounces to the number of twenty-two mem
</p>
<p>bers. Others replace the absent ; the oldest presides ;
</p>
<p>the composition of each section is decided by lot.

<p>PIECE, No. XXV.
</p>
<p>The Secret Directory to the Agents.
</p>
<p>All the steps are taken, the measure of our tyrants'
</p>
<p>crimes is full to overflowing ; we must rise !
</p>
<p>Here are the orders and instructions to which we de
</p>
<p>sire you to conform strictly : 
</p>
<p>1 . To-morrow morning, at ... . o'clock, you will cause
</p>
<p>the tocsin to be rung in all the sections of your arron
</p>
<p>dissements, and as many trumpets as you can possibly
</p>
<p>procure, to be sounded in the streets. The general-in-
</p>
<p>chief will send you some, after the insurrection commences,
</p>
<p>if he can take possession of the place where they are de
</p>
<p>posited. It were desirable that the platoons, or, at least,
</p>
<p>the arrondissements, should be preceded, as they march,
</p>
<p>by sound of trumpet.
</p>
<p>2. At the same instant you will cause the manifestoes
</p>
<p>we send you, to be placarded and spread profusely; and
</p>
<p>you will make the mass of the people rise by means of
</p>
<p>your agents whom you should have previously apprised.
</p>
<p>3. The Directory has nominated the following citizens
</p>
<p>to be the people's generals during the insurrection  to
</p>
<p>wit, &c. &c. You will cause them to be recognised 
</p>
<p>first, by the subalterns whom we have chosen, and after
</p>
<p>wards by the entire people, and you will see that then-
</p>
<p>orders be punctually followed.
</p>
<p>4. You will find herein annexed the list of citizens of
</p>
<p>your respective arrondissements, whom, agreeably to the
</p>
<p>information transmitted by you, we have deemed most
</p>
<p>competent to lead the people to the conquest of its rights.
</p>
<p>Each of them shall command one of the platoons into
</p>
<p>which the people is to be divided ; the citizen appointed
</p>
<p>as chief, shall command the arrondissement ; the sub-
</p>
<p>chiefs will command the sections.
</p>
<p>5. You will immediately apprise the chiefs of arron
</p>
<p>dissements to whom you will make known the names of

<p>at the same time to apprise the sub-chiefs to hold them

<p>platoons in whom you can fully rely ; the rest shall be
</p>
<p>apprised only at the moment of rising. You are at
</p>
<p>jroerty not to employ such commanders of platoons as
</p>
<p>you may have reason to suspect or doubt.
</p>
<p>6. You will consign to the chiefs, sub-chiefs, and com
</p>
<p>manders of platoons, the standards referred to in the
</p>
<p>Manifesto. 7. You will order them to take immediate possession
</p>
<p>(and at any cost or price) of the arms and ammunition
</p>
<p>which may be found at the adjutants' houses and at the
</p>
<p>chief stations of the sections.
</p>
<p>8. You will make all the cannoneers that may offer
</p>
<p>themselves, to muster in a body, that they may be ready
</p>
<p>to execute the orders of the generals.
</p>
<p>9. You will make choice of energetic patriots, to whom
</p>
<p>you will confide the business of haranguing and electri
</p>
<p>fying the people. You will, at the same time, turn to
</p>
<p>account the pathetic and persuasive eloquence of the
</p>
<p>women, whom you will direct, as we have already told
</p>
<p>you in our preceding instructions, towards the soldiers,
</p>
<p>to whom they will present civic crowns, while they exhort
</p>
<p>them (by all the powerful considerations they know so
</p>
<p>well how to employ) to mingle and amalgamate with the
</p>
<p>ranks of the people.
</p>
<p>10. From the instant the effervescence begins, you will
</p>
<p>encourage it by causing the report to be spread, that the
</p>
<p>camps of Grenelle and of Vincennes have already ranged
</p>
<p>themselves on the people's side. It is necessary, that in
</p>
<p>fraternising with the people, the soldiers should mingle in
</p>
<p>the ranks of the sans-culottes, and that they should
</p>
<p>neither march in bodies, nor under the directions of their
</p>
<p>officers. 1 1 . You will order the chiefs and commanders to seize,
</p>
<p>or disperse all persons attempting to rally to the orders
</p>
<p>of the Government, and under the command of the
</p>
<p>officers of the National Guard. All warrants, ordon-

</p>
<p>12. You will be careful to follow and rally the mass of

</p>
<p>every quarter of an hour, by expresses, of the state of
</p>
<p>the insurrection.
</p>
<p>13. Should the generals order the mass of your arron
</p>
<p>dissement to divide itself, you will follow the larger division,
</p>
<p>and you will confide the surveillance of the remainder to
</p>
<p>some zealous citizen, whose name you will forthwith
</p>
<p>transmit to us, and whom you will order likewise to send
</p>
<p>us expresses every quarter of an hour.
</p>
<p>14. You will communicate all your instructions to
</p>
<p>whatever sans-culotte most deserves your confidence, that
</p>
<p>he may replace you in case any accident should happen
</p>
<p>to you personally.
</p>
<p>15. You will order (on our part) three members of the
</p>
<p>revolutionary committees of each section of your arron

</p>
<p>and who have preserved themselves most incorrupt, to
</p>
<p>resume their functions at the first sound of the tocsin.
</p>
<p>Failing these, you will choose other patriots, whom you
</p>
<p>will charge to take, in concert with us, all the requisite
</p>
<p>measures for executing the Insurrectional Act ; above
</p>
<p>all, they must occupy themselves with the articles con
</p>
<p>cerning the bakers, and the refreshments to be furnished
</p>
<p>to the people.
</p>
<p>16. You will also order them to forthwith put in re
</p>
<p>quisition the horses, mules, and vehicles necessary for
</p>
<p>the transport of provisions, ammunition, and the wounded.
</p>
<p>In taking possession of the magazines of flour, you will
</p>
<p>be careful to establish guards to watch them, and to
</p>
<p>secure to the bakers, in the vicinity, a continued supply.
</p>
<p>17. The instant the insurrection begins you will send
</p>
<p>us (to remain near us) ten armed and resolute sans
</p>
<p>culottes of your arrondissment ; they will serve to carry

<p>orders, and in the last extremity we will bury ourselves

<p>beside them under the ruins of -liberty.

<p>FRAGMENT
</p>
<p>(Of the Draught of an Address to the Victorious
</p>
<p>People).
</p>
<p>TRIUMPHANT PEOPLE !
</p>
<p>Citizens !  If to command the interest of his
</p>
<p>audience, the subject of an orator's address should con
</p>
<p>tain matters of the highest importance, never did orator
</p>
<p>deserve to be listened to with more attention than I am
</p>
<p>about to experience. I implore this attention at your
</p>
<p>hands. I beg it, and desire to prepare you for it beforehand,
</p>
<p>happy people ! in the name of this blessed day, which
</p>
<p>now shines upon us. I would seek to augment it by
</p>
<p>intimating that the things I have to address you on, are
</p>
<p>more important still than the sublime conquest you have
</p>
<p>just achieved. In short, if confidence in him who
</p>
<p>speaks, and in those in whose name he speaks, can
</p>
<p>augment the degree of application in one's auditors, I
</p>
<p>fancy that I do not prejudice my claims on your atten
</p>
<p>tion when I announce that at this moment you hear
</p>
<p>speak the organ of the Insurrectional Committee of
</p>
<p>Public Safety.
</p>
<p>People once more free ! people unfettered and vic
</p>
<p>torious ! abandon yourselves to unconstrained trans
</p>
<p>ports ; your masters are no more ! The time is passed

<p>when in your presence, and while they treated of your

</p>
<p>liberty, your lives, your dearest interests, they wished to
</p>
<p>make a vile automaton of you. We do not ask you 
</p>
<p>we do not  to give any signs of approbation or of dis
</p>
<p>approbation. Sovereign people! if we betray you  if
</p>
<p>henceforward our words were also (like the rest of your
</p>
<p>deceivers) to be only the forerunners of our perfidy and
</p>
<p>crimes  in the name of our country, and of liberty, do
</p>
<p>not suffer us to finish them ; instantly, on the "spot,
</p>
<p>rebuke us ; punish us !
</p>
<p>Again I deem it suitable to my exordium, people of
</p>
<p>France, to declare to you here who the members are of
</p>
<p>this Insurrectional Committee of Pubhc Safety, in whose
</p>
<p>name I address you. Here are their names ....
</p>
<p>France ! it is thy universal self that hearest me ! And
</p>
<p>you, my auditors, who, with us, compose her first libera
</p>
<p>tors, I have promised you, as well as her, to speak of
</p>
<p>matters worthy of this great day  of matters more in
</p>
<p>teresting than even the distinguished triumph it has
</p>
<p>shone upon. I will state and propose things which will
</p>
<p>guarantee the people against ever losing the fruits of this
</p>
<p>triumph. It is ever to the people I address myself ; I still see only
</p>
<p>the people here. The Insurrectional Act makes mention of
</p>
<p>a representation ; such representation does not yet exist,
</p>
<p>since it is not yet recognized. It does not as yet exist,
</p>
<p>since the people, still in insurrection, continues to exercise
</p>
<p>its rights and power undelegated  since all other power
</p>
<p>disappears in its (the people's) presence. A representa
</p>
<p>tion does not as yet exist, because the fruits of the in
</p>
<p>surrection are not yet gathered in, nor even assured to
</p>
<p>the people. Citizens, take effective advantage of this
</p>
<p>circumstance. Let no old juggling trick illude you. It
</p>
<p>is you who are here. I see no senate here ; it is, con
</p>
<p>sequently, to you, to you alone, I am going to address
</p>
<p>myself; and I repeat, it is important  of sovereign im
</p>
<p>portance  that you give me all your attention. The

</p>
<p>PROCLAMATION TO THE SOLDIERS.
</p>
<p>Soldiers !  The moment approaches to save or ruin the
</p>
<p>country for ever ! Our people, wearied under the weight of
</p>
<p>afflictions, is about to rise in its wrath against oppression.
</p>
<p>It is resolved to destroy tyranny, or expire with liberty.
</p>
<p>No ; they cannot be patriots who would longer endure
</p>
<p>the existence of a government raised up (against the
</p>
<p>people's will) on the tombs of its warmest friends, on the-
</p>
<p>violation of its rights, and on the destruction of all popular
</p>
<p>laws. The misery of the people has reached its maximum,
</p>
<p>and all means of making its voice be heard are taken
</p>
<p>away. It no longer has either society or public assembly
</p>
<p>to echo its complaints or support its remonstrances. The
</p>
<p>councils and the Directory which show themselves so
</p>
<p>humane and gracious towards the great, and the re
</p>
<p>spectables, have neither heart, nor bowels, nor ears, nor
</p>
<p>voice for the people.* If any one speaks or writes for
</p>
<p>the latter, he is imprisoned, he is destroyed. No, never
</p>
<p>was tyranny more atrocious, more insupportable ; the
</p>
<p>people, for whom the Revolution was made, are treated
</p>
<p>by our rulers as a vile rabble that must be chained down
</p>
<p>for their (the rulers') safety ; and the men, whom such
</p>
<p>excessive barbarity revolts  the very men who overthrew
</p>
<p>the Bastile and the throne  are called Royalists by these
</p>
<p>same villains, in order to deceive and arm the weak and
</p>
<p>ignorant against them. By such perfidious Machiavelism
</p>
<p>do they hope first to delude, and afterwards bayonet you
</p>
<p>as they did in Germinal and Prairial of the Year III.
</p>
<p>You are sans-culottes, and you will not fight against
</p>
<p>those who, like you, have uprooted royalty ! Listen, and
</p>
<p>do not abandon yourselves to illusion.
</p>
<p>The people desires the Constitution of 1793, which it
</p>
<p>unanimously accepted, but of which it has been perfidi
</p>
<p>ously despoiled, through the massacre and incarceration

<p>this Constitution, because in abrogating all distinctions of
</p>
<p>riches, this Constitution renders all men equal before the
</p>
<p>law ; because it assures property and relief to the de
</p>
<p>fenders of the country and to the poor ; and because it
</p>
<p>authorises the people to put a veto on all laws which
</p>
<p>they may deem prejudicial to their interests.
</p>
<p>If you are not the friends of kings, of nobles, and of
</p>
<p>monied vampires, you will be on our side ; you will not
</p>
<p>heed the deceitful language of your staff-officers, who, in
</p>
<p>contempt of their oft-repeated oaths, have flung them
</p>
<p>selves, body and soul, into the arms of the present go
</p>
<p>vernment, because it pays a good price for their baseness,
</p>
<p>and above all, because it permits them to exercise over
</p>
<p>you the intolerable despotism which you had overthrown
</p>
<p>in 1789.
</p>
<p>Ah ! little dreamt ye, when you were shedding your
</p>
<p>blood on the frontiers to defend the country, what horrors
</p>
<p>were meanwhile committed in the interior ! You fancied
</p>
<p>vou were fighting for liberty, for the people ; while your
</p>
<p>victories, your blood, only served to raise up a new
</p>
<p>tyranny  new distinctions  a new insolence on the ruins
</p>
<p>of the old despotism.
</p>
<p>Look at this Directory! Do you not recognise the
</p>
<p>court of the Capets in its insolent pomp, its magnificent
</p>
<p>palaces, its numerous body-guard, its arrogance, the pa
</p>
<p>rasitical baseness of its courtiers ? And our generals, so
</p>
<p>elegantly costumed, do they not exhibit, by their luxury
</p>
<p>and disdainful pride, the exact counterpart of the haughty
</p>
<p>nobles whose palaces they have usurped? Ah! too well you
</p>
<p>now perceive, brave soldiers ! that the Revolution, which
</p>
<p>was destined to re-establish equality, has hitherto done
</p>
<p>no more than replace a band of old robbers by a multi
</p>
<p>tudinous crew of new ones.
</p>
<p>Patriotic administrators were guiding the Revolution
</p>
<p>towards the relief and comfort of the oppressed poor.

</p>
<p>Well! after two years of counter-revolutions, you
</p>
<p>ought to be disabused. The Terrorists are those who,
</p>
<p>throughout the whole of the Revolution, have been com
</p>
<p>batting for the rights of the people ; who incessantly
</p>
<p>invoke and demand the promised recompenses for you,
</p>
<p>and relief for the distressed poor  who gave death to the
</p>
<p>enemies of the people ; they are the men, in short, by
</p>
<p>whose sides you have so often made the satellites of
</p>
<p>tyrants turn pale. See then, whether we or our enemies
</p>
<p>are best entitled to your esteem.
</p>
<p>Soldiers ! open your eyes ; you are of the people.
</p>
<p>Could you arm against the people? Why this animosity
</p>
<p>against your brothers of the Legion of Police? They
</p>
<p>are banished to a distance, because they see clearly;
</p>
<p>because they will not cut our throats ; in a day or two
</p>
<p>you also will be undeceived, and made the subjects of the

</p>
<p>Soldiers ! whether with red collars or white collars,
</p>
<p>are you not all children and defenders of the country ?
</p>
<p>Have you not all fought together for the triumph of

<p>liberty ? Friends, embrace one another, arid turn your

<p>combined arms against the usurpers, who, fearing the just

<p>vengeance of the people, hope to find a support in your

<p>of her maledictions.

<p>You are not the Government's soldiers, but the people's

</p>
<p>that pays you by its sweat and privations ; and should

<p>you arm against the people, as your tyrants pretend

<p>PIECE No. XXVII. j
</p>
<p>Fragment of a Projet, or Draught of a Decree of
</p>
<p>Police (left by the Conspirators).
</p>
<p>Art. 1. Individuals who do nothing for the country
</p>
<p>can exercise no political rights in it. They are strangers
</p>
<p>to whom the Republic accords hospitality.
</p>
<p>2. They do nothing for the country who do not serve
</p>
<p>it by some useful occupation or labour.
</p>
<p>3. The law considers as useful occupations : 
</p>
<p>Those of agriculture, pastoral life, fishing, and navi
</p>
<p>gation ;
</p>
<p>Those of the mechanical and manual arts ;
</p>
<p>Those of retail dealing ;
</p>
<p>Those appertaining to the transport of men and things ;
</p>
<p>Those appertaining to war ;
</p>
<p>Those of instruction, education, and the sciences ;
</p>
<p>4. Nevertheless, the occupations of teaching and the
</p>
<p>sciences shall not be reputed useful, if those who exercise
</p>
<p>them do not produce, within a given time, a certificate
</p>
<p>of civism, delivered after forms to be hereafter regulated.
</p>
<p>5. The exercise of political rights is preserved to citi
</p>
<p>zens whose useful occupations have been suspended by
</p>
<p>the infirmities or circumstances of the Revolution.
</p>
<p>6. Foreigners are interdicted from entering the public
</p>
<p>assemblies. 7. Foreigners are under the direct surveillance of the
</p>
<p>a<iministration in chief, which may temporarily remove
</p>
<p>them from their ordinary domicile, and send them to
</p>
<p>places of correction.
</p>
<p>8. Every foreigner admitted to the rights of hospitality,
</p>
<p>becomes an aspirant to the rights of citizenship, if he
</p>
<p>enters into the national community. He exercises these
</p>
<p>rights as soon as he can present a certificate of civism.
</p>
<p>9. The law determines the period after which no one
</p>
<p>shall be competent to exercise the rights of citizenship
</p>
<p>who is not a member of the national community.

</p>
<p>whatever arms they are possessed of, in the hands of the

</p>
<p>12. On the first decadi next following the promulgation
</p>
<p>of the present decree, the citizens shall meet in general
</p>
<p>assembly to re-organise the National Guard.
</p>
<p>13. There shall be formed, within the shortest possible
</p>
<p>time, in the environs of Toulon, Valence, Grenoble,
</p>
<p>Macon, Metz, Clermont, Angouleme, and Toulouse
</p>
<p>camps destined to maintain tranquillity, to protect the
</p>
<p>Repubhcans, and to favour reform.
</p>
<p>14. For this purpose, the revolutionary committees
</p>
<p>shall select, and make depart immediately for the places
</p>
<p>designed, four Republicans from each company of the
</p>
<p>National Guard, completely armed, equipped, and pro
</p>
<p>vided with whatever is necessary for encampment.
</p>
<p>15. The provisions or contents of the military decree
</p>
<p>are applicable to the above camps.
</p>
<p>16. These camps will be broken up as soon as the
</p>
<p>new laws may be peaceably executed.
</p>
<p>17. The Isles Marguerite and Honore, d'Hieres,
</p>
<p>d'Oleron, and de Rhe, shall be converted into bridewells,
</p>
<p>or places of correction, whither shall be sent (to be bound
</p>
<p>to hard labour in common with other convicts) suspected
</p>
<p>foreigners, and all persons arrested in consequence of the

<p>proclamation to the French people.
</p>
<p>18. These isles shall be rendered inaccessible; they

<p>shall have administrations directly subject to the Govern
</p>
<p>ment. 19. Those of the prisoners who will furnish proofs of
</p>
<p>amendment, of activity in the works, and of good con

<p>duct, shall be privileged to re-enter the Republic, and
</p>
<p>acquire therein the rights of citizenship.

</p>
<p>2. The national community holds proprietorship of
</p>
<p>the possessions hereinafter mentioned  to wit : 
</p>
<p>The possessions which, being declared national, were
</p>
<p>not sold up to the 9th Thermidor of the Year II.
</p>
<p>The possessions of the enemies of the Revolution,
</p>
<p>which the decrees of the Sth and 13th Ventose of the
</p>
<p>Year II. had vested in the unhappy poor.
</p>
<p>The possessions forfeited, or to be forfeited, to the
</p>
<p>Republic, in consequence of judiciary condemnations.
</p>
<p>The buildings now in occupation for the public
</p>
<p>service. The possessions which the communes enjoyed pre
</p>
<p>viously to the law of the 10th June, 1793.
</p>
<p>The possessions appropriated to hospitals, charitable
</p>
<p>institutions, and establishments for public instruction.
</p>
<p>The lodgings occupied by the needy citizens, in
</p>
<p>execution of the proclamation to the French on the ... .
</p>
<p>The possessions which may be voluntarily abandoned
</p>
<p>to the Republic by their present owners.
</p>
<p>The usurped possessions of such as have enriched
</p>
<p>themselves in the exercise of public functions.
</p>
<p>The possessions of which no use is made by their pre
</p>
<p>sent holders.
</p>
<p>3. The right of succession, whether by inheritance or v
</p>
<p>will, is abolished. All the wealth actually possessed by
</p>
<p>individuals shall lapse, at their decease, to the national

</p>
<p>5. Every French person, of either sex, who makes a
</p>
<p>voluntary surrender to his country of all his effects, and

<p>of is a member of the great national community.
</p>
<p>6 Old men who have attained their sixtieth year, and
</p>
<p>the infirm, if they are poor, are, of right, members of the
</p>
<p>national community.

<p>7. As also, all young persons brought up in the
</p>
<p>national houses of education.
</p>
<p>8. The possessions of the national community are em
</p>
<p>ployed in common by all its valid members.
</p>
<p>9. The grand national community maintains all its
</p>
<p>420 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>members in an equal and honourable mediocrity ; it pro
</p>
<p>vides them with everything they want.
</p>
<p>10. The Republic invites all good citizens to contribute
</p>
<p>to the success of reform, by a voluntary surrender of their
</p>
<p>possessions to the community.
</p>
<p>11. After the date of , no one can be a civil or
</p>
<p>military functionary, who is not a member of the said
</p>
<p>community. 12. The grand national community is administered by
</p>
<p>local magistrates, freely chosen by its members, agree
</p>
<p>ably to the laws, and under the direction of the supreme
</p>
<p>administration. * * *
</p>
<p>13. [The remainder of this projet, like several other
</p>
<p>papers of the conspirators, appears to have been lost,
</p>
<p>or left imperfect.  Bronterre.]
</p>
<p>Of Occupations in Common.
</p>
<p>Art. 1. Every member of the national community
</p>
<p>owes to it such labour as he is capable of, in agriculture
</p>
<p>and the useful arts.
</p>
<p>2. Are excepted, old persons of sixty years, and the
</p>
<p>infirm. 3. Citizens who, by the voluntary abandonment of
</p>
<p>their possessions, will become members of the national
</p>
<p>community, shall not be subjected to any painful labour,
</p>
<p>if they have attained their fortieth year, and if they did
</p>
<p>not exercise a mechanical art before the publication of
</p>
<p>the present decree.
</p>
<p>4. In each commune the citizens are distributed by
</p>
<p>classes. There are as many classes as there are useful
</p>
<p>arts ; each class is composed of all those who profess the
</p>
<p>same art.
</p>
<p>5. There are, amongst each class, magistrates named by
</p>
<p>those composing it ; these magistrates direct the works 
</p>
<p>see to their equal repartition  execute the orders of the
</p>
<p>municipal administration, and set an example of zeal
</p>
<p>and activity.
</p>
<p>6. The law determines, for each season, the daily

</p>
<p>duration of the labour of the members of the national
</p>
<p>community. 7. There is with each municipal administration, a
</p>
<p>council composed of old men, delegated by each class of
</p>
<p>babeuf's conspiracy. 421
</p>
<p>workers ; this council enlightens the administration upon
</p>
<p>everything which concerns the distribution, the mitiga
</p>
<p>tion, and the improvement of works.
</p>
<p>8. The supreme administration will apply to the works
</p>
<p>of the national community the use of such machines
</p>
<p>and processes as are suited to diminish the labour of men.
</p>
<p>9. The municipal administration attends to and regu
</p>
<p>lates the condition of the workers of each class, and that
</p>
<p>of the task to which they are appointed. It regularly
</p>
<p>informs the supreme administration of what passes.
</p>
<p>10. The displacement of workers from one commune
</p>
<p>to another is ordered by the supreme administration,
</p>
<p>according to its knowledge of the powers and wants of
</p>
<p>the community.
</p>
<p>1 1 . The supreme administration condemns to forced
</p>
<p>labour, under the surveillance of communes nominated
</p>
<p>for the purpose, individuals of both sexes, whose in-
</p>
<p>civism, idleness, luxury, and dissoluteness, set pernicious
</p>
<p>examples to society  their possessions are appropriated
</p>
<p>by the national community.
</p>
<p>12. The magistrates of each class cause to be depo
</p>
<p>sited in the magazines of the national community, the
</p>
<p>fruits of the land, and the productions of art susceptible
</p>
<p>of conservation. 13. The new verification of these objects is regularly
</p>
<p>communicated to the supreme administration.
</p>
<p>14. The magistrates attached to the class of agri
</p>
<p>culture superintend the propagation and improving the
</p>
<p>breed of animals proper for food; they also see that the
</p>
<p>people be well clothed, that they have the means of
</p>
<p>transport and conveyance, and that they be supplied with
</p>
<p>proper refreshments, and every other means of mitigating
</p>
<p>their burdens.
</p>
<p>Of the distribution and use of the possessions of the
</p>
<p>National Government.
</p>
<p>Art. 1. No member of the national community can

</p>
<p>enjoy or use anything but what the law assigns him, by
</p>
<p>the actual delivery of the magistrates.
</p>
<p>'2. The national community guarantees, from this in
</p>
<p>stant, to each of its members 
</p>
<p>422 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>A healthy, commodious, and well-furnished habitation;
</p>
<p>Clothing for work-hours, and clothing for the hours of
</p>
<p>respite, linen and woollen, conformably to the national
</p>
<p>costume; Washing, lighting, and firing;
</p>
<p>A sufficient supply of food in bread, meat, fowl, fish,
</p>
<p>eggs, butter or oil, wine, and other drinks, used in the
</p>
<p>different climes or regions; vegetables, fruits, seasoning,
</p>
<p>and other articles, the due combination of which con
</p>
<p>stitutes a competent and frugal state of comfort. Also,
</p>
<p>medical aid and attendance.
</p>
<p>3. There will take place in each commune, at stated
</p>
<p>periods, repasts in common, at which all the members of
</p>
<p>the community will be bound to assist.
</p>
<p>4. The keep of public and military functionaries is the
</p>
<p>same as that of the members of the national community.
</p>
<p>5. Every member of the national community who re
</p>
<p>ceives pay, or hoards money is punished.
</p>
<p>6. Members of the national community can receive
</p>
<p>the common ration only in the arrondissement where they
</p>
<p>are domiciled, except in cases of removal authorised by
</p>
<p>the administration.
</p>
<p>7. The domicile or settlement of actual citizens is that
</p>
<p>which they enjoy at the publication of the present decree ;
</p>
<p>that of young people, brought up in the national houses
</p>
<p>of education, is in the commune where they were born.
</p>
<p>8. There are, in each commune, magistrates charged
</p>
<p>to distribute, at the respective domiciles, to the members
</p>
<p>of the national community, the productions of agri
</p>
<p>culture and of the arts.
</p>
<p>9. The law determines the rules of such distribution,
</p>
<p>10. [Left unfinished.] * * * *
</p>
<p>Of the administration of the National Community
</p>
<p>1 . The national community is under the legal direc
</p>
<p>tion of the supreme administration of the state.

</p>
<p>the Republic is divided into regions.
</p>
<p>3. A region comprises all the contiguous departments
</p>
<p>whose productions are pretty nearly the same.
</p>
<p>4. There is in each region an intermediary adminis-
</p>
<p>babeuf's conspiracy. 423
</p>
<p>tration, to which the departmental administrations are
</p>
<p>subordinate. 5. Lines of telegraph accelerate the correspondence
</p>
<p>between the departmental administrations, and the inter
</p>
<p>mediary ones between the latter and the supreme ad
</p>
<p>ministration. 6. The supreme administration determines (according
</p>
<p>to law) the kind and quotation of distributions to be
</p>
<p>made to the members of the community of each region.
</p>
<p>7. Agreeably to this determination, the departmental
</p>
<p>administrations make known to the intermediary ones
</p>
<p>the deficit or the superfluities of their respective arron
</p>
<p>dissements. 8. The intermediary administrations compensate, as
</p>
<p>nearly as may be, the deficit of one department by the
</p>
<p>superfluity of another, direct the necessary payments and
</p>
<p>transports, and render account to the supreme adminis
</p>
<p>tration of their wants and superfluities.
</p>
<p>9. The supreme administration provides for the wants
</p>
<p>of the deficient regions, by the superfluity of those which
</p>
<p>have too much, or by exchange with foreigners.
</p>
<p>10. Above all, the supreme administration causes to
</p>
<p>be previously levied and deposited every year in the
</p>
<p>military magazines, the tenth of all the harvests of the
</p>
<p>community. 11. It provides that the superfluities of the Republic
</p>
<p>be carefully preserved, as provision against years of
</p>
<p>scarcity.
</p>
<p>Of Commerce.
</p>
<p>Art. 1. All private commerce with foreigners is forbid;
</p>
<p>any merchandize so acquired will be confiscated to the
</p>
<p>profit of the national community ; contraveners will be
</p>
<p>punished. .
</p>
<p>2 The Repubhc procures for the national community
</p>
<p>whatever commodities it wants, by exchanging its super
</p>
<p>fluous productions of agriculture and art for those ot
</p>
<p>foreign states.
</p>
<p>3 For this purpose commodious entrepdts are estab

<p>lished on the frontiers, by land and water.
</p>
<p>424 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>4. The supreme administration negociates with
</p>
<p>foreigners through its agents; it makes the latter deposit
</p>
<p>the superfluities to be exchanged, in the entrepots, where
</p>
<p>it receives from foreigners the commodities agreed for.
</p>
<p>5. The agents of the supreme administration in the
</p>
<p>entrepots of commerce are frequently changed; pre
</p>
<p>varications are severely punished.
</p>
<p>Of Transport and Conveyance.
</p>
<p>Art. 1. There are magistrates in each commune
</p>
<p>charged to direct the transport of communal possessions
</p>
<p>or goods from one commune to another.
</p>
<p>2. Each commune is provided with sufficient means
</p>
<p>of transport, whether by land or water.
</p>
<p>3. The members of the national community are called
</p>
<p>in rotation to conduct and superintend the commodities
</p>
<p>transported from one commune to another.
</p>
<p>4. Every year the intermediary administrations charge
</p>
<p>a certain number of young people (chosen in all the
</p>
<p>departments subordinate to them) with the more distant
</p>
<p>transports. 5. Citizens charged with any transport whatever, are
</p>
<p>maintained and provided for in the commune where
</p>
<p>they happen to be.
</p>
<p>6. The supreme administration causes to be trans
</p>
<p>ported from commune to commune, by the shortest
</p>
<p>rout, under the surveillance of inferior administrations,
</p>
<p>such commodities as are required to make up the deficit
</p>
<p>of regions which experience a scarcity.
</p>
<p>Of Contributions.
</p>
<p>Art. 1. Individuals not belonging to the national com
</p>
<p>munity are alone subject to contribution.
</p>
<p>2. They are liable to the contributions already stated.
</p>
<p>3. These contributions will be gathered in kind, and
</p>
<p>paid into the magazines of the national community.
</p>
<p>4. The total of the quotas of those liable to contribu
</p>
<p>tion, for the current year, is double of that of last year.

</p>
<p>babeuf s conspiracy. 425
</p>
<p>departments progressively* on all rendered subject
</p>
<p>to it.
</p>
<p>6. The non-communionists may be required, in case
</p>
<p>of need, to pay into the magazines of the national com

<p>PIECE No. XXX.
</p>
<p>THE LAST LETTER OF GRACCHUS BABEUF.
</p>
<p>(To my Wife and to my Children.)
</p>
<p>Farewell, my friends. I am about to enter the
</p>
<p>night of eternity. The friend to whom I address the two
</p>
<p>letters you will see  to that friend I describe my situation
</p>
<p>and feelings towards you, better than I can describe
</p>
<p>them to yourselves. It seems as if I felt nothing from
</p>
<p>feeling too much. I place your fate in his hands. Alas !
</p>
<p>I know not that you will find him in a condition to be
</p>
<p>able to do what I ask of him ; I know not how you will
</p>
<p>be able to gain access to him. Your love for me has led
</p>
<p>you here through all the obstacles of our misery. You
</p>
<p>have supported yourselves in the midst of pains and
</p>
<p>privations ; your constant sensibility has made you
</p>
<p>follow every moment of this long and cruel procedure,
</p>
<p>of which, like me, you have drank the bitter chalice.
</p>
<p>But I know not what steps you mean to take to return
</p>
<p>to the place whence you came ; I know not how my
</p>
<p>memory will be appreciated, though I am conscious of
</p>
<p>having conducted myself in tile most irreproachable
</p>
<p>manner. I know not, in short, what is to become of all
</p>
<p>the Republicans, their families, and even their little ones
</p>
<p>at the breast, in the midst of the royal furies which the
</p>
<p>counter-revolution is going to excite. Oh, my friends !
</p>
<p>how harrowing are these reflections for my last moments !
</p>
<p>To die for my country.  to leave a family, chil
</p>
<p>dren, a beloved wife, would, after all, be more support
</p>
<p>able, if I did not behold liberty destroyed, and every
</p>
<p>thing that appertains to sincere Reupblicans involved
</p>
<p>in the most horrible proscription. Ah ! my dear children!
</p>
<p>what will become of you ? I cannot at this moment help
</p>
<p>feeling the most intense emotions. . . .Think not that I
</p>
<p>feel regret for having sacrificed myself for the noblest of
</p>
<p>causes ; even should all my efforts prove unavailing for

</p>
<p>it, I have fulfilled my mission ....
</p>
<p>If, contrary to my expectation, you can survive the
</p>
<p>babeuf s conspiracy. 427
</p>
<p>terrible tempest which now rages over the Republic , and
</p>
<p>over all that was attached to it ; if you can restore your
</p>
<p>selves to a tranquil situation, and find some friends to
</p>
<p>aid you to triumph over your bad fortune, I would re
</p>
<p>commend you to five well-united together. I would re
</p>
<p>commend my wife to endeavour to bring up and guide
</p>
<p>her children with mildness, and I would recommend my
</p>
<p>children to deserve their mother's goodness, by respecting
</p>
<p>and always obeying her. It belongs to the family of a
</p>
<p>martyr of liberty to give the example of every virtue, in
</p>
<p>order to attract the esteem and attachment of all good
</p>
<p>people. I would desire my wife to do all in her power
</p>
<p>to give education to her children, by engaging her
</p>
<p>friends to yield her all the assistance possible towards
</p>
<p>such object. I invite Emilius to comply with this wish
</p>
<p>of a father, whom I believe he much loves, and by whom
</p>
<p>he was so tenderly beloved ; I invite him to comply
</p>
<p>with it without loss of time, and as soon as he possibly
</p>
<p>can. My friends, I hope you will remember me, and often
</p>
<p>speak of me. I hope you will beheve that you were
</p>
<p>always most dear to me. I knew no other way to render
</p>
<p>you happy, than by promoting the happiness of all. I
</p>
<p>have failed. I have sacrificed myself; it is for you, as
</p>
<p>well as for liberty, I die.
</p>
<p>Speak often of me to Camille ; tell him a thousand
</p>
<p>and a thousand times that I bore him tenderly in my
</p>
<p>heart. Tell Caius as much, when he will be capable of
</p>
<p>understanding it.
</p>
<p>Lebois has announced the printing of our defence in
</p>
<p>separate parts ; let mine receive the greatest possible
</p>
<p>publicity. I recommend my wife  my sweet friend  not
</p>
<p>to give Baudouin, Lebois, or others, any copy of my
</p>
<p>defence, without having another perfectly correct one in
</p>
<p>her possession, as a security that that defence may never
</p>
<p>be lost. You will feel, my love, that this defence is pre

<p>cious; that it will be always dear to virtuous hearts, and
</p>
<p>to the friends of their country. The only possession that
</p>
<p>will remain to you, from me, will be my reputation ; and
</p>
<p>I am sure that both you and your children will derive
</p>
<p>much consolation from the enjoyment of it. You will

<p>love to hear it said by all feeling and upright hearts, in
</p>
<p>speaking of your husband  of your father 
</p>
<p>He was perfectly virtuous.
</p>
<p>Adieu ! No more. I hold to the earth but by a single
</p>
<p>thread, which to-morrow's light will sever. That is
</p>
<p>certain ; too clearly I see it. The sacrifice must take
</p>
<p>place. The wicked are in the ascendant; I yield to
</p>
<p>them. At all events, it is sweet to die with a conscience
</p>
<p>so pure as mine; the only thing harrowing or cruel in it,
</p>
<p>is to be torn from your arms, oh, my tenderest friends !
</p>

<p>THE END.
</p>
<p>TO MY FRIENDS AND READERS
</p>
<p>Babeuf's letter to his wife and children is the last of
</p>
<p>the justificative pieces. I have now concluded a work
</p>
<p>which, were I to die to-morrow (leaving unexecuted the
</p>
<p>larger and more important ones I am preparing), would
</p>
<p>console me for the misspent part of my life. The history
</p>
<p>of Babeuf s conspiracy ought to be preserved, if it were
</p>
<p>only to undeceive mankind respecting the true character
</p>
<p>of the French Revolution, and of the causes which oc
</p>
<p>casioned its failure.
</p>
<p>My readers are aware that, at the commencement of
</p>
<p>the work, I was ignorant whether Buonarroti was living
</p>
<p>or dead. Judge my surprise and delight when, some
</p>
<p>five weeks ago, a letter, dated Paris, and from Buonarroti
</p>
<p>himself, came to apprise me that he was still living, and
</p>
<p>to furnish me with a list of the real names of the con
</p>
<p>spirators, of which I was previously only able to give the
</p>
<p>anagrams. The handwriting of the letter is exceedingly
</p>
<p>small  so small as almost to require a microscope to read
</p>
<p>it. The following is a verbatim copy, as well as I could
</p>
<p>make it out : 
</p>
<p>(From Buonarroti to Bronterre.) Paris, May 3, 1836.

</p>
<p>de faire connoitre ceux qui partagerent les travaux et les dangers
</p>
<p>de Babeuf.

<p>Mon intention n'est certainement pas de vous parler de moi.

</p>
<p>d'anachronismes et des fautes : on m'attribue des choses que je n'ai
</p>
<p>pas faites ; celles que je pouvais revendiquer sont ou tronquees ou

<p>mal rendues ; les evenements sont quelquefois deplaces, et la bonne

</p>
<p>TRANSLATION.
</p>
<p>My Brother, Not having yet taken leave of life, 1 am happy
</p>
<p>in being able to testify to you the satisfaction I have felt in learn
</p>
<p>ing, through the prospectuses you have distiibuted, the zeal with
</p>
<p>which you have determined on publishing, in English, my history
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy of Babeuf. Please to accept my most earnest
</p>
<p>thanks. I owe them to the man whose love of his fellow-creatures
</p>
<p>induces him to brave insult and persecution  the lot always
</p>
<p>reserved for whosoever dares to raise his voice against oppressive
</p>
<p>institutions, and to pave the way for the progress of truth and
</p>
<p>justice. It is with real joy I see that England also contains sin
</p>
<p>cere friends of that pure equality, for which I had the happiness
</p>
<p>of joining my feeble efforts to those far more glorious ones of my
</p>
<p>friends, who sealed them with their blood.
</p>
<p>Although an ocean of inveterate habits and vile passions still
</p>
<p>obscure reason, and chain down men's wiUs, we must not despair
</p>
<p>of the salvation of humanity. It wiU advance, I am convinced, in
</p>
<p>the road of sociality and happiness ; and we shall enjoy, in a
</p>
<p>happier life, the good which we have dimly foreseen, and of which
</p>
<p>our successors, wiser than their fathers, wiU be able to possess
</p>
<p>themselves. Annexed to this is a note, containing the real names
</p>
<p>(of the conspirators), which I beg you will substitute for the
</p>
<p>anagrams that prudential motives made me employ at the time of
</p>
<p>pubUshing my work. These motives have no longer any weight,
</p>
<p>and it is just to make known the persons who shared the labours
</p>
<p>and dangers of Babeuf.
</p>
<p>It is certainly not my intention to speak of myself. What would
</p>
<p>humanity gain by becoming acquainted with the exact details,
</p>
<p>good or bad, of my life ? I content myself with apprising you,
</p>
<p>that the compilations whence you have gleaned my biography
</p>
<p>abound in anachronisms and errors. Things are attributed to me
</p>
<p>which I have not done; those wliich I might justly claim are
</p>
<p>either mutilated or badly expressed ; events are sometimes out of
</p>
<p>place ; and the good opinion you are disposed to entertain of me
</p>
<p>has dictated to you eulogies in my favour, which, I am ashamed

</p>
<p>to say, I do not merit.
</p>
<p>A particular opportunity, of which I gladly avaU myself, affords
</p>
<p>me the facility of sending you a biographical essay on Robespierre,
</p>
<p>of which the publication appears to me desirable ; mayhap you
</p>
<p>wUl deem it suitable to your purpose to make use of it.
</p>
<p>I consider myself very fortunate in the event which has pro
</p>
<p>cured me your acquaintance. Men of the stamp you appear to be
</p>
<p>are rare enough as times go ; and it is a source of satisfaction to
</p>
<p>me to learn, for certain, that in England there is something besides
</p>
<p>greediness of riches and the spirit of the shop ; and that, by the side
</p>
<p>432 babeufs conspiracy.
</p>
<p>of your lordships, and your priests of Plutus, there are to be found
</p>
<p>deep thinkers, and admirable despisers of human folly.
</p>
<p>Believe me, my brother, that if you take the trouble to write to
</p>
<p>me, I will esteem myself happy in cultivating your acauaintance.

<p>he only sources I have had access to for my biographical
</p>
<p>ketch are " Phillips' Biographical Anecdotes of the
</p>
<p>Founders of the French Revolution," and some few

<p>English periodicals, including the Quarterly Review in

</p>
<p>idded nothing to what is contained in these sources. If

<p>[ am wrong, they are wrong  and if I have been too
</p>
<p>audatory of the author, it is because I found the friends
</p>
<p>uid enemies of his principles equally zealous to do
</p>
<p>iomage to his virtues. I expect very soon to have the
</p>
<p>pleasure of a personal interview with Buonarroti, in which

</p>
<p>details of his life which his modesty prevented him from

<p>information I may collect in Paris, shall be laid in some

</p>
<p>THE LEGACY OF ROBERT OWEN,
</p>
<p>TO THE POPULATION OF THE WORLD.
</p>
<p>' Sacred to Truth, without Mystery, Mixture of Error, or Fear of Man."
</p>
<p>More than half a century ago I discovered that there was some
</p>
<p>grievous error deep in the foundations of society, which created
</p>
<p>evil, and prevented the good which man by his nature was evi
</p>
<p>dently destined, in some stage of his progress, to attain and per
</p>
<p>manently to enjoy.
</p>
<p>From that period to the present, I have never ceased honestly
</p>
<p>and fearlessly to search for that truth which should enable me to
</p>
<p>detect the error, remove the evil, and for ever establish the good.
</p>
<p>Having found this truth, and proved it to be such by the only
</p>
<p>criterion of truth known to man ; that is, by its undeviating con
</p>
<p>sistency with ascertained facts, I now give it to you, that through
</p>
<p>its influence you may be regenerated, your minds born again, and
</p>
<p>your posterity be made partakers of the endless blessings which
</p>
<p>this truth, and this truth alone, can insure permanently for the
</p>
<p>human race.
</p>
<p>This great truth which I have now to declare to you is, that
</p>
<p>the system on which all the nations of the world are acting is founded in
</p>
<p>gross deception, in the deepest ignorance, or in a mixture of both. That,
</p>
<p>under no possible modification of the principles on which it is based, can
</p>
<p>it ever produce good to man ; but that, on the contrary, its practical
</p>
<p>results must ever be to produce evil continually.
</p>
<p>And, consequently, that no reaUy intelligent and truly honest
</p>
<p>individual can any longer support it : for, by the constitution of
</p>
<p>this system, it unavoidably encourages and upholds, as it ever
</p>
<p>has encouraged and upheld, hypocrisy and deception of every
</p>
<p>description, and discouraged and opposed truth and sincerity
</p>
<p>whenever truth and sincerity were applied permanently to im
</p>
<p>prove the condition of the human race. It encourages and up
</p>
<p>holds national vice and corruption to an unlimited extent ; whilst,
</p>
<p>to an equal degree, it discourages national virtue and honesty.
</p>
<p>The whole system has not one redeeming quality: its very
</p>
<p>virtues, as they are termed, are vices of great magnitude. Its

</p>
<p>charities, so called, are gross acts of injustice and deception. Its
</p>
<p>instructions are to rivet ignorance in the mind, and, if possible,
</p>
<p>to render it perpetual. It supports, in all manner of extravagance,
</p>
<p>idleness, presumption, and uselessness; and oppresses, in almost
</p>
<p>every mode which ingenuity can devise, industry, integrity, and
</p>
<p>usefulness. It encourages superstition, bigotry, and fanaticism ;
</p>
<p>and discourages truth, common sense, and rationality. It gene
</p>
<p>rates and cultivates every inferior quality and base passion that
</p>
<p>human nature can be made to receive ; and has so disordered all
</p>
<p>the human intellects, that they have become universally perplexed
</p>
<p>and confused, so that man has no just title to be called a reason
</p>
<p>able or rational being. It generates, under the title of glorious
</p>
<p>war, violence, robbery, and murder, and extols and rewards
</p>
<p>these vices as the highest of all virtues.
</p>
<p>Its laws are founded in gross ignorance of individual man and
</p>
<p>BABEUF S CONSPIRACY. 435
</p>
<p>of human society ; they are cruel and unjust in the extreme, and,
</p>
<p>united with all the superstitions of the world, are calculated only
</p>
<p>to teach men to call that which is pre-eminently true and good,
</p>
<p>false and bad ; and that which is glaringly false and bad, true and
</p>
<p>good. In short, to cultivate with great care all that leads to per
</p>
<p>manent vice and misery in the mass, and to exclude from them,
</p>
<p>with equal care, all that would direct them to true knowledge and
</p>
<p>real happiness, which alone, combined, deserve the name of
</p>
<p>virtue. In consequence of the dire effects of this wretched system upon
</p>
<p>the whole of the human race, the population of Great Britain (the
</p>
<p>most advanced of modern nations in the acquirement of the means
</p>
<p>to create riches, power, and happiness; has created and supports
</p>
<p>a theory and practice of government, which is directly opposed
</p>
<p>to the real weU-being and true interest of every individual member
</p>
<p>of the empire, whatever may be his station, rank, or condition 
</p>
<p>whether sovereign or subject. And so enormous are the increas
</p>
<p>ing errors of this system now become, that, to uphold it, the
</p>
<p>government is compelled, day by day, to commit acts of the
</p>
<p>grossest cruelty and injustice, and caU such proceedings laws of
</p>
<p>justice and Christian mercy.
</p>
<p>Under this system, the idle, the useless, and the vicious govern the
</p>
<p>population of the world ; whilst the useful and truly virtuous, as
</p>
<p>far as such a system wiU permit men to be virtuous, are by them
</p>
<p>degraded and oppressed.
</p>
<p>Under this system, those who daily and hourly practise the art
</p>
<p>of poisoning the body, deranging the intellects, and reducing in
</p>
<p>dividuals to the lowest stage of human existence, are openly
</p>
<p>fostered and encouraged, until they build palaces of temptations,
</p>
<p>to excite to every conceivable vice and crime, and at the same
</p>
<p>time to teach almost a continued language of the vilest and most
</p>
<p>demoralizing oaths : whilst those who, to protect themselves and
</p>
<p>their helpless families, by their industry and good conduct, from
</p>
<p>these dire effects, meet together to aid and encourage each other
</p>
<p>in their wise and virtuous proceedings, and engage to do so by

<p>prisons, subjected to a worse than farcical trial, found guilty by

<p>ignorant and prejudiced individuals, and sentenced to a cruel,

<p>ignominious, and grossly unjust punishment.
</p>
<p>Men of industry, and of good and virtuous habits! this is the last

<p>state to which you ought tosubmit; nor would I advise you to allow

<p>the ignorant, the idle, the presumptuous, and the vicious, any-
</p>
<p>longer to lord it over the weU-being, the lives and happiness, of
</p>
<p>yourselves and families, when, by three days of such idleness as
</p>
<p>constitutes the whole of their lives, you would for ever convince
</p>
<p>each of these mistaken individuals that you now possess the
</p>
<p>power to compel them at once to become the abject slaves, and
</p>
<p>the oppressed portion of society, they have hitherto made you.
</p>
<p>But all the individuals now living are the suffering victims of
</p>
<p>this accursed system, and all are objects of pity : you will, there
</p>
<p>fore, effect this great and glorious revolution without, if possible,
</p>
<p>inflicting individual evil. You can easily accomplish this most-
</p>
<p>to-be-desired object. Proceed with your Lnion on the pnnc.ples
</p>
<p>you have latterly adopted; they are wise and just; and wisdom

<p>for ever legal.

<p>Men of industry, producers of wealth and knowledge, and of

<p>all that is truly valuable in society ! unite your powers now to create
</p>
<p>a wise and righteous state of human existence ; a state in which the only

<p>contest shall be, who shall produce the greatest amount of permanent

<p>awaiting your proper application of them to effect this change,

<p>and circumstances have arisen within the last week to render

<p>Men of industrious habits, you who are the most honest, useful,

<p>now rally round the Consolidated Union, and become members of
</p>
<p>it; and, if the irrationality of the present degraded and degrading

<p>system should render it necessary, you will discover the reasons
</p>
<p>why you should willingly sacrifice all you hold dear in the world,
</p>
<p>and life itself, rather than submit to its dissolution or slightest
</p>
<p>depression. For your sakes, I have become a member of your Consolidated

<p>Union ; and while it shall be directed with the same wisdom and
</p>
<p>justice that it has been from its commencement, and its proceed
</p>
<p>ings shall be made known to the public as you intend them to be,
</p>
<p>my resolve is to stand by our order, and support the Union to the
</p>
<p>utmost of my power. It is this Consolidated Union that can alone
</p>
<p>save the British empire from greater confusion, anarchy, and
</p>
<p>misery than it has ever yet experienced. It is, it will daily
</p>
<p>become more and more, the real conservative power of society ; for its
</p>
<p>example will be speedily followed by all nations, and through its
</p>
<p>beneficial example the greatest revolution ever effected in the his

<p>tory of the human race will be commenced, rapidly carried on,

<p>and completed over the world, without bloodshed, violence, or

<p>The period has arrived when we, the producers of wealth and

<p>THE RATIONAL SYSTEM.
</p>
<p>Experience has proved that man has always been the creature
</p>
<p>of the circumstances in which he has been placed, and that it is
</p>
<p>the character of these circumstances which inevitably makes him
</p>
<p>ignorant or intelligent, vicious or virtuous, wretched or happy.
</p>
<p>It is, therefore, necessary to acquire a knowledge ot the influence
</p>
<p>which individual and general circumstances have over human
</p>
<p>nature ; that is, to learn what particular circumstances produce
</p>
<p>among mankind ignorance, vice, and misery, and what intelli
</p>
<p>gence, virtue, and happiness ; and to discover how to remove the
</p>
<p>former, and to secure the latter ; and this will be acquired by the
</p>
<p>study of the following fundamental laws of human nature :
</p>
<p>WHAT HUMAN NATURE IS,
</p>
<p>AND THE FACTS FROM WHICH THE RATIONAL SYSTEM OF SOCIETY IS
</p>
<p>nERIVED.
</p>
<p>1. Man is a compound being, whose character is formed of his
</p>
<p>constitution or organization at birth, and of the effects of external
</p>
<p>circumstances upon it, from birth to death ; such original organiza
</p>
<p>tion and external influences continually acting and re-acting each
</p>
<p>upon the other.
</p>
<p>2. Man is compelled by his original constitution to receive his
</p>
<p>feelings and his convictions independent of his will.
</p>
<p>3. His feelings or his conDictions, or both of them united, create
</p>
<p>the motive to action called the will, which stimulates him to act,
</p>
<p>and decides his actions.
</p>
<p>4. The organization of no two human beings is ever precisely
</p>
<p>similar at birth ; nor can art subsequently form any two indi
</p>
<p>viduals, from infancy to maturity, to be the same.
</p>
<p>5. Nevertheless, the constitution of every infant, except in case
</p>
<p>of organic disease, is capable of being formed or matured either
</p>
<p>into a very inferior or a very superior being, according to the quali

<p>ties of the external circumstances allowed to influence that con

<p>stitution from birth.

</p>
<p>Exchange, Charlotte-street, on May 1, 1833, denouncing the Old
</p>
<p>System of the World, and announcing the Commencement of the New.
</p>
<p>The existing condition of mankind makes it evident to those
</p>
<p>who can reflect, and who have been formed with minds capable of
</p>
<p>generalizing the ideas acquired from the past and present history
</p>
<p>of the human race, that the associations of men, from their com
</p>
<p>mencement, have been founded upon a false basis, and that, in
</p>
<p>consequence, man has been formed to be the creature of error and
</p>
<p>deception, of sin and of misery.
</p>
<p>All associations have been based on the supposition that man
</p>
<p>possesses the power to believe and to feel according to the bidding
</p>
<p>of others ; and that virtue consists in thus believing and feeling,
</p>
<p>BABEUF S CONSPIRACY. 439
</p>
<p>and vice in refusing so to believe and feel. And by analyzing the
</p>
<p>complex proceedings of mankind, it has been discovered that the
</p>
<p>system ot forming the human character, and of governing the
</p>
<p>human race, derived from these notions, is the only system that
</p>
<p>has ever been known in any part of the world, and consequently
</p>
<p>is the only one that has yet been practised.
</p>
<p>The experience of the past, the only valuable knowledge which
</p>
<p>man has acquired, proves that this system continually generates,
</p>
<p>and effectually cultivates, all the inferior animal passions is
</p>
<p>opposed to the progress of real knowledge, to natural sincerity, to
</p>
<p>all the higher moral virtues, and to the finest and best feelings of
</p>
<p>our nature. Also, that as long as this system shall be supported,
</p>
<p>ignorance, poverty, and of necessity, sin and misery, must con
</p>
<p>tinually pervade all the associations of men ; while pure charity
</p>
<p>and affection must remain as hitherto, unknown and unpractised.
</p>
<p>Clearly perceiving this wretched state of human existence, and
</p>
<p>knowing that all governments are blind to its errors, inconsisten
</p>
<p>cies, and wickedness, I have decided, after the most calm and
</p>
<p>deliberate reflection, to renounce on this day, thus publicly, in
</p>
<p>wL.u may be justly caUed the metropolis of the civilized world,
</p>
<p>for myself and my disciples, the entire of this old system, and to
</p>
<p>declare my conviction that to countenance it any longer will be
</p>
<p>the grossest act of folly and the greatest of all crimes.
</p>
<p>1 also thus announce my determination henceforward to advocate
</p>
<p>thus openly and fairly another system, founded upon opposite prin
</p>
<p>ciples, and leading to a totally different practice.
</p>
<p>It is also my determinution to recommend to all who think with
</p>
<p>me, to adopt the same course, and now to put these principles into
</p>
<p>full practice, and to assert the natural right of all men to act con
</p>
<p>scientiously, according to their convictions, as long as their conduct
</p>
<p>shall be benencial to the public and not injurious to others.
</p>
<p>If the existing laws of this country cannot protect the people
</p>
<p>in this moral and only really virtuous line of conduct, it is evident
</p>
<p>a despotism exists over the pubUc mind which ought now to cease,
</p>
<p>and that the constitu-ion of this and other countries ought to be

</p>
<p>changed to meet the improved intelligence of the age.
</p>
<p>It is now the time to try the moral courage of men, and to ascer
</p>
<p>tain who possesses virtue and knowledge sufficient to abandon
</p>
<p>falsehood for truth, folly for wisdom ; yes, the period has arrived
</p>
<p>when the moral courage of man will be put to the test, and it will
</p>
<p>be proved who are prepared to overcome the mental bondage in
</p>
<p>which, hitherto, all have been held from their infancy.
</p>
<p>Do you feel desirous to ask me what we of the " Sev; World"
</p>
<p>now mean to relinquish, and what to adopt 1
</p>
<p>That none may misunderstand our proceedings, or falsify our
</p>
<p>intentions, I now thus openly, before the world, declare that 1.
</p>
<p>We abandon aU the false religions that have been forced upon the
</p>
<p>liun.an race, founded on the supposition that man, by his will, has
</p>
<p>the power to believe or feel as he likes, or to believe contrary to
</p>
<p>his convictions, or feel contrary to hi;, nature, at the bidding of
</p>
<p>others. L2. We now adopt the only religion which can be true, because
</p>
<p>it is derived immediately from the unchangeable and everlasting
</p>
<p>laws of nature, which never lie, or deceive the human race. The
</p>
<p>basis of this Relicion of Tru-ih, the only one which ever can
</p>
<p>conduct man to the practice of pure charity and real virtue, and to
</p>
<p>the enjoyment of unalloyed happiness, is the knowledge that the
</p>
<p>iaws of nature have given the power to adutt man, so to controul
</p>
<p>440 BABEUFS CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>the mental faculties and physical powers of his infant, as to force
</p>
<p>it to receive error, however absurd and inconsistent, or to imbibe
</p>
<p>truth only, known to be truth by its undeviating consistency with
</p>
<p>the ascertained laws of nature ; and to acquire the most wretchedly
</p>
<p>vicious and injurious, or the most highly virtuous and beneficial
</p>
<p>habits through life : and thus, through our new religion, we attain
</p>
<p>fhe invaluable knowledge of the certain mode by which, without
</p>
<p>individual reward, or punishment, or responsibility, to make the
</p>
<p>whole human race morally, inteUectually, and physically, either
</p>
<p>inferior or superior, good or bad, miserable or happy ; and yet no
</p>
<p>two of them is likely ever to be formed to be without various
</p>
<p>desirable physical and mental differences.
</p>
<p>3. Our future practice will be in conformity with this new re
</p>
<p>ligion, as far as the rapidly expiring errors of the old system shall
</p>
<p>be removed to admit its adoption, and the evils necessarily ema
</p>
<p>nating from this old system we shall now adopt every means to
</p>
<p>make manifest to the human race.
</p>
<p>4. We shall be opposed to no men, but solely to the old errors,
</p>
<p>which in the period of their mental weakness they have been
</p>
<p>compelled to receive.
</p>
<p>5. In conformity with the principles of the new religion of de
</p>
<p>monstrable truth, we shall adore in admiring silence, as alone
</p>
<p>becomes man, that, to us, at present, Incomprehensible Power,
</p>
<p>which acts in and through all nature, everlastingly composing,
</p>
<p>decomposing, and recomposing the materials of the universe, pro
</p>
<p>ducing the endless variety of life, of mind, and of organised form.
</p>
<p>6. We will not degrade, blaspheme, or merel} humanise this
</p>
<p>power, so far beyond man's present knowledge, as to attribute to it
</p>
<p>the human form and passions, or any of the qualities of our limited
</p>
<p>senses and vague imaginations.
</p>
<p>7. Neither will we attempt to force others to receive or ac
</p>
<p>knowledge our impressions upon this subject, seeing that up to this
</p>
<p>hour similar attempts have confounded and perplexed the human
</p>
<p>mind, making man in every district in the world a degraded mental
</p>
<p>slave, irrational and miserable. On the contrary, we shall patiently

</p>
<p>wait until an evident accurate knowledge of this power shall be
</p>
<p>made manifest to all mankind, who will then, by the law of their
</p>
<p>nature, be compelled to admire and to love it, in proportion to the
</p>
<p>extent and the goodness of the qualities which it shall be discovered
</p>
<p>to possess.
</p>
<p>By this course of proceeding, dictated bv common sense, or plain
</p>
<p>right reasoning from self-evident facts, ail injurious differences of
</p>
<p>opinions respecting religion will cease from among men; charity
</p>
<p>unlimited will take the place of presumption and violence ; anger,
</p>
<p>ill-will, and irritation of all kinds will cease, and in place thereof'
</p>
<p>pure love and affection, through a superior education, will be
</p>
<p>made to pervade and direct all the proceedings of mankind.
</p>
<p>8. Directed by this knowledge and these feelings, we will as
</p>
<p>soon as it shall be practicable, form arrangements to create New
</p>
<p>Institutions to new form the general character of the rising generation
</p>
<p>and to regenerate the existing adult population ; for the period is near
</p>
<p>at hand when the minds of men must be born again; when they
</p>
<p>shall no longer see as through a glass darkly, but face to face, and
</p>
<p>Know each other even as they know themselves.
</p>
<p>To effect this change, other arrangements, very different from
</p>
<p>those which now exist, wil be formed to insure a superior educa-
</p>
<p>SlT,1 ' SUh aS W1" glve, a new and very superior character
</p>
<p>to all children ; arrangements that will preclude any cliild free

<p>BABEUF S CO*SPIRACY. 441
</p>
<p>from mental disease, or bodily defect, from acquiring physical,
</p>
<p>intellectual, or meral injurious habits 01 qualities ; and that will
</p>
<p>render the succeeding generations a superior order of beings,
</p>
<p>compared with those who have hitherto lived.
</p>
<p>9. As a knowledge of facts has now disclosed to us that, liking
</p>
<p>or disliking, or loving or hating, depend not upon the will ot
</p>
<p>man, but upon the manner in which his organization is affected
</p>
<p>by the ever-varying qualities of external objects, none will be
</p>
<p>required to perjure themselves, as they are compelled to do under
</p>
<p>the old system of the world, before they can legally enjoy the
</p>
<p>natural rights of the sexes, by solemnly declaring that they will
</p>
<p>love to the end of life a being who is liable to perpetual change,
</p>
<p>and whom they may be forced to dislike or hate before the year
</p>
<p>expires. >o! instead of this blasphemy against the laws of
</p>
<p>nature, other arrangements dictated by common sense, or right
</p>
<p>reason* will be formed to insure all the good that can be derived,
</p>
<p>and to avoid all the vice and evil that has been experienced from
</p>
<p>the social converse between the sexes. All will then be fully
</p>
<p>conscious, and wUl openly acknowledge that pure chastity con
</p>
<p>sists in forming this connexion only when affection exists between
</p>
<p>the parties, and that it is a vile, abominable, and injurious prosti
</p>
<p>tution to form or continue this connexion when there is no affec-
</p>
<p>* Many persons grossly mistake our views on the subject of the union
</p>
<p>of the sexes. Our object is to remote the causes ol the immense amount
</p>
<p>of sexual crime and misery, and consequent physical and mental
</p>
<p>disease which now exist- It is nature's laws, now disregarded, which
</p>
<p>we desire to discover and implicitly obey ; there being none other which
</p>
<p>can produce -virtue and happiness. In the present absence of real
</p>
<p>knowledge derived from experience, and with the existing irregular
</p>
<p>feelings of the population of the world, created Ly a false education, we
</p>
<p>CSopose that the union and disunion of the sexes should take place under
</p>
<p>?*-.e following regulations :  Persons having an affection for each other,
</p>
<p>. _nd being uesirous of forming a union, first announce such intention
</p>
<p>publicly in our Sunday assemblies. If the intention remain at the end
</p>
<p>of three months, they make a second public declaration which declara

</p>
<p>tions being registered in the books of the society will constitute their
</p>
<p>marriage. In our new world, marriages will be solely formed to promote the hap
</p>
<p>piness of the sexes, and if this end be not obtained, the object of the
</p>
<p>union is defeated. Should the parries, therefore, after the termination ot
</p>
<p>twelve months at the soonest, discover that their dispositions and habits
</p>
<p>are unsuited to each other, and that there is little or no prospect of
</p>
<p>happrness being derived from their union, they are to make a public
</p>
<p>declaration, as before, to that effect, after which they return, and live
</p>
<p>together six months longer, at the termination of which, if they still find
</p>
<p>their qualities discordant, they make a second declaration, both of which
</p>
<p>being duly registered and witnessed, wffl constitute their legal sepa-
</p>
<p>^The'above cases apply only when both parties unite in the declarations.
</p>
<p>Should one alone come forward upon the last declaration, and the other
</p>
<p>object to the separation, they would be required to live together another
</p>
<p>six months, to try if their feelings and habits could be made to accord,
</p>
<p>so as to promote happiness. But if at the end of the second six months,
</p>
<p>the objecting party shall remain of the same mind, the separation is then
</p>
<p>to be final, and the parties may, without diminution of public opinion,
</p>
<p>form new unions more suited to their dispositions.
</p>
<p> Si the children of the new world will be trained and educated
</p>
<p>under the superintendence and care of the Society, the separation of the
</p>
<p>parentrwill not produce any change in the condition of the rising
</p>
<p>stneratiom Under these arrangements, we have no doubt, a much
</p>
<p>more vimous and happy state of society will be enjoyed than anywfucl,
</p>
<p>has existed at any time in any part of the world.

</p>
<p>tion between the parties, even when they are what is called legally
</p>
<p>bound to each other. The union between the sexes will be, in
</p>
<p>consequence, always pure and chaste ; it will be a union ot affec
</p>
<p>tion only ; it will continue as long as that affection can be main
</p>
<p>tained, and cease only, under well-devised public forms and
</p>
<p>regulations, when the affection between the parties can no longer
</p>
<p>be made to exist. And the experience of the world has proved
</p>
<p>that affection is much more disinterested, pure, and durable,
</p>
<p>without than with these legal bonds. In order to prevent con
</p>
<p>fusion or any evil whatever by these changes, other arrangements,
</p>
<p>very different from the existing family arrangements, Witt be
</p>
<p>made, in conformity with this superior union between the sexes,
</p>
<p>and the superior national education to be provided tor the
</p>
<p>children. ...
</p>
<p>10. We shall abandon the present degrading and demoralizing
</p>
<p>mode of distributing wealth by the ordinary method in practice,
</p>
<p>of buying cheap and selling dear, through the medium of the
</p>
<p>common money of the old system of the world. Arrangements
</p>
<p>will be made, as speedily as possible, to effect an equitable
</p>
<p>exchange of labour for equal value of labour throughout society,
</p>
<p>by the intervention of the labour note, the most perfect money in
</p>
<p>all respects ever yet introduced into society. But this method of

<p>transacting the business of life will be an intermediate and tem
</p>
<p>porary arrangement only, and will be continued no longer than
</p>
<p>till permanent arrangements can be formed to re-constitute

<p>of society, in practice, the due proportion of the producing, dis

<p>organized that more of all kinds of wealth, possessing intrinsic

<p>value, may be, with advantage to all parties, so easily created,
</p>
<p>that those made to be the most penurious or avaricious will cease
</p>
<p>to desire any individual accumulation of it ; and all contests, pri
</p>
<p>vate or public, for the possession of wealth, will terminate for
</p>
<p>ever. And then all the human powers and faculties will be
</p>
<p>directed, to promote in a straightforward manner, to the exclusion

</p>
<p>of all private interests, the general happiness of the whole of
</p>
<p>society. 11. Conscious of the unlimited powers possessed by the British
</p>
<p>nation when wisely united in its operations, to produce wealth
</p>
<p>through all future time, far beyond the wants or desires of its
</p>
<p>population, we renounce the principle of individual competition
</p>
<p>in the production and distribution of wealth, as being, in its
</p>
<p>immediate and remote consequences, not only the most demo
</p>
<p>ralizing principle on which man can now act and govern his
</p>
<p>affairs, but as being, also, the greatest obstacle, in practice, to the
</p>
<p>beneficial production and distribution of wealth, to the formation
</p>
<p>of a superior individual and national character, and to the well-
</p>
<p>ordering and good government of the people.
</p>
<p>12. VVe shall, therefore, as soon as the means can be obtained,
</p>
<p>exchange the principle of competition, and of mistaken individual
</p>
<p>interest, for the principle of unlimited union and of undivided
</p>
<p>national interests. And by this change in conducting the affairs
</p>
<p>of this empire, we know that more and better wealth can be pro
</p>
<p>duced in one day than is now produced in one week ; that this
</p>
<p>greater amount and better quality of wealth can be more advan
</p>
<p>tageously distributed for the whole population, by one day's occu
</p>
<p>pation of those at present employed to distribute wealth, than is
</p>
<p>cow effected by them under the existing competitive system of
</p>
<p>babeuf's CONSPIRACY. 443
</p>
<p>distribution in one month; that by this change, with less labour
</p>
<p>and capital than are now applied to the task, the individual and
</p>
<p>national character can be formed to be many hundred-fold superior
</p>
<p>to that which has been, is, or am be found under the competitive
</p>
<p>system, and that by the abandonment of the principle of division
</p>
<p>of interosts, the empire will be more easily and far better governed
</p>
<p>than it ever has been under the old system, with one per cent, of
</p>
<p>the capital and labour which are now required.
</p>
<p>13. As the false basis upon which the moral part of the old
</p>
<p>system has been founded, united with the principle of competi
</p>
<p>tion, when applied to practice, form together the sole cause which
</p>
<p>renders law, or codes of law, necessary m society, we, of the new
</p>
<p>world, renounce all law proceedings in our transactions with each
</p>
<p>other, and we will form arrangements to adjust whatever dif
</p>
<p>ferences may arise between individuals, or associations of indi
</p>
<p>viduals, by the decision of three persons selected for their superior
</p>
<p>knowledge and experience in the new principles, and their known
</p>
<p>love of justice ; these individuals to be annually chosen by the
</p>
<p>elders of their district.
</p>
<p>Courts of law, and all the paraphernalia and folly of law, with
</p>
<p>its animosities and ruinous expense, cannot be found in a rational
</p>
<p>state of society, and will, therefore, not be found among the children
</p>
<p>of the new world.
</p>
<p>14. As the principles on which this new system is based will
</p>
<p>immediately check, and effectuaUy prevent the growth of anger
</p>
<p>and ill-will, and speedUy remove all the causes of dislike from
</p>
<p>among the chUdren trained from infancy in the new world, war
</p>
<p>will be discountenanced, and ultimately abrogated as a practice,
</p>
<p>the most grossly ignorant and vicious that a well-ordered or rational
</p>
<p>mind can conceive ; a practice contrary to our new religion, and
</p>
<p>to be foUowed only by those who have been made irrational from
</p>
<p>their birth, or by wholesale murderers and robbers.
</p>
<p>Charity, peace, and good-will to the whole family of mankind,
</p>
<p>without regard to any of the petty artificial or irrational causes of
</p>
<p>division now existing between them, will be the inevitable, and

</p>
<p>therefore, uniform practice of all the children of the new world;
</p>
<p>and one of their chief offices, until the ignorance which causes the
</p>
<p>evil shall be removed, wiU be to reconcile man to man, and nation
</p>
<p>to nation, throughout the world, and to enable all to understand
</p>
<p>that they have but one interest, which is, to insure the permanent
</p>
<p>happiness of each and all, to promote which, by every means that
</p>
<p>the aggregate of knowledge and power can devise, will be the
</p>
<p>great business of human life, and then will he seen how easy and
</p>
<p>straightforward is the true path to real virtue and the most refined
</p>
<p>15 But although private and public warfare and contests, with
</p>
<p>their endless train of unavoidable crime and misery, will be un
</p>
<p>known among the children of the new world, effeminacy, with tits
</p>
<p>train of evil, will also be discountenanced and discarded. I he
</p>
<p>new mode of forming the character of the children of the new
</p>
<p>world will cultivate, and bring forth to maturity and perfection
</p>
<p>all the physical, intellectual, and moral faculties and powers which
</p>
<p>have been given to human nature. Arrangements will be formed
</p>
<p>to admit anil encourage the due exercise of each of these faculties
</p>
<p>and powers up to the point of temperance, for it is only by all
</p>
<p>of the-n being caUed into action at the period designed by nature,
</p>
<p>that man can feel satisfied, contented, and nappy. Anxiety is the
</p>
<p>natural feeling which arises when any one of these propensities or
</p>
<p>444 babeuf's CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>qualities is not duly exercised. The physical powers will, there
</p>
<p>fore, be better cultivated than they were in the best days of Greece
</p>
<p>and Rome, and a far superior form of body and expression of mind,
</p>
<p>and a duly regulated activity of both will be obtained for all the
</p>
<p>future generations.
</p>
<p>t In consequence, celibacy, in either sex, beyond the period designed
</p>
<p>by nature, will be no longer considered a virtue, but, on the con
</p>
<p>trary, it will be known to be, as it is, a great crime agamst nature,
</p>
<p>causing other unatural crimes, all of which produce disease of
</p>
<p>body and mind, giving a false direction to both thoughts and feel
</p>
<p>ings, and thereby making the human race the most artificial, un
</p>
<p>natural, and criminal beings in existence. The earth is yet a
</p>
<p>wilderness for want of people to drain its marshes and cultivate its
</p>
<p>soil, nor does it yet produce one-thousandth part of the excellence
</p>
<p>and enjoyment which it is capable of bringing forth and perma
</p>
<p>nently sustaining. Upon this, and almost all other important
</p>
<p>subjects, the world is in gross darkness, because it has hitherto
</p>
<p>been instructed and governed, or rather uninstructed and mis
</p>
<p>governed, by men trained to possess only the most feeble and
</p>
<p>puny knowledge of themselves, of nature, and of wise and good
</p>
<p>gavernment. 16. We now also renounce the separate interests which have
</p>
<p>been created by the errors of the old world ; and we will adopt
</p>
<p>another mode of carrying on the general business of society. Ori
</p>
<p>ginally many and various occupations were performed by one
</p>
<p>individual ; but as population increased in particular places, the
</p>
<p>variety of employments practised by one person gradually dimi
</p>
<p>nished, until they are now become so much divided, that many
</p>
<p>individuals have their time and attention taken up and occupied in
</p>
<p>making a small part of a common pin, a needle, or of thread, to the
</p>
<p>destruction of their health, their mental faculties, and all the
</p>
<p>higher enjoyments of a rational existence. Experience has nuw
</p>
<p>developed the means by which the union and division of labour may
</p>
<p>be combined to secure the peculiar advantages of both, without the
</p>
<p>evils of either. The science of society, so totally unknown in the
</p>
<p>old world, has disclosed the necessity for, and the benefits of,

</p>
<p>uniting a due proportion of agriculture, manufactures, commerce,
</p>
<p>education, and government, in every separate association, for
</p>
<p>carrying on the business of life : and in the new world all these
</p>
<p>individualised and opposing interests will become one, and each
</p>
<p>part thus united, will essentially aid and promote all the others.
</p>
<p>The communities of the new world, when the public shall acquire
</p>
<p>any rational notions respecting them, will be found to be nothing
</p>
<p>less than a combination of all these interests, so united as to ensure
</p>
<p>to every individual living within them, the greatest amount of
</p>
<p>advantages, and the highest degree of individual freedom and
</p>
<p>happiness that human nature, in its present state of knowledge, is
</p>
<p>capable of enjoying. Thus will man, as a member of an association
</p>
<p>formed purposely for his benefit, experience the utmost share of
</p>
<p>individual freedom that is compatible with the still higher privi
</p>
<p>leges of a social state of existence.
</p>
<p>17. We consequently abandon all the arrangements to which
</p>
<p>these separate interests have given birth ; such as large cities,
</p>
<p>towns, villages, and universities, as well as the existing arrange
</p>
<p>ments for carrying on the business of agriculture, detached from ma
</p>
<p>nufactures, education, and commerce. These accidental individual
</p>
<p>circumstances, formed without knowledge or foresight, are not
</p>
<p>such as can ever form man into a rational being, or insure to him
</p>
<p>babeuf's CONSPIRACY. 445
</p>
<p>more than a very small portion of the wealth, health, and happiness,
</p>
<p>which his nature may be made to enjoy.
</p>
<p>18. We also abandon, to the irrationality of the old system of
</p>
<p>the world, all places for ceremonial worship of an unknown Power,
</p>
<p>and with them all mysteries in every department of life, as being-
</p>
<p>much worse than useless. In like manner, we abandon to the
</p>
<p>same system, all places of punishment and confinement, such
</p>
<p>as prisons, penitentiaries, houses of correction, and workhouses ;
</p>
<p>and all charitable institutions, as they are called, as being promi
</p>
<p>nent and magnificent monuments of the utter incapacity of the
</p>
<p>rulers of human affairs, to form arrangements to insure a superior
</p>
<p>character, wealth, and health of body and mind, to the respective
</p>
<p>populations which they have governed, or do now attempt to
</p>
<p>govern. 19. We abandon also all individual ambition and desire for
</p>
<p>personal distinction, knowing we possess nothing but what we
</p>
<p>have received, and that these personal distinctions cannot benefit
</p>
<p>mankind, but are, in themselves, the cause of endless errors, crimes,
</p>
<p>and miseries, and tend to keep men in perpetual ignorance of
</p>
<p>themselves, and to make them highly irrational.
</p>
<p>i'O. We also dismiss, for similar reasons, all envy and jealousy
</p>
<p>from the new world, in which all will partake of the advantages
</p>
<p>derived from the excellencies of each; all will, therefore, feel
</p>
<p>their happiness to be increased in proportion as each excels in all
</p>
<p>superior qualifications, and in consequence all will aid to enable
</p>
<p>each individual to acquire and enjoy them. Thus will unity of
</p>
<p>design, of duty, of interest, and of sympathy, among the human
</p>
<p>race, supersede the division, competition, and opposition of man
</p>
<p>to man, and nation to nation, and remove the causes of all the
</p>
<p>envy and jealousy which instigate to crime, make man a demon,
</p>
<p>and the earth a pandemonium.
</p>
<p>I therefore now proclaim to the world the commencement, on
</p>
<p>this day, of the promised miUennium, founded on rational prin
</p>
<p>ciples and consistent practice.

<p>London, on the 13th May, 1833.)
</p>
<p>Men of the Great Family of Mankind-
</p>
<p>We vour relatives and friends, have been, enabled, through

<p>446 babeuf's CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>finest and best feelings. But we are now wide awake, and have
</p>
<p>become fully conscious of all the evUs which we and you have so
</p>
<p>long suffered. Our eyes have been opened to our real position in
</p>
<p>society ; we have at length discovered the true source of our
</p>
<p>power, and the most effectual mode of applying it for the benefit
</p>
<p>of all future generations.
</p>
<p>To accomplish the great work which we are about to undertake,
</p>
<p>many and most important changes in conducting the affairs of life
</p>
<p>must of necessity be made ; and we now put forth this statement
</p>
<p>to obtain your approval and ardent co-operation, because we
</p>
<p>desire that these changes should be effected by reason, and not
</p>
<p>by force.
</p>
<p>We, therefore, intend now to make manifest the necessity which
</p>
<p>has arisen at this period for the adoption of these changes, and
</p>
<p>also to convince the population of the world of their truth and
</p>
<p>justice, and thus to carry the minds of all with us ; and, in the
</p>
<p>spirit of charity and kindness, to prevent all future revolutions of
</p>
<p>violence, by removing the causes which germinate and bring them
</p>
<p>to maturity.
</p>
<p>We perceive that the evils which have afflicted the human
</p>
<p>race have arisen from ignorance ; our remedy is to remove this
</p>
<p>ignorance. the materials for the production of happiness superabound 
</p>
<p>they are now unused, or misused. We mean to bring them into
</p>
<p>action, and give them a right direction.
</p>
<p>The materials for the production of happiness are the earth and
</p>
<p>human beings. The former requires but to be well cultivated, and
</p>
<p>properly arranged to produce abundance, and to form a terrestrial
</p>
<p>paradise. 1 he latter, but to be trained from birth according to
</p>
<p>the laws of their nature, and all their faculties and qualities to be
</p>
<p>made available, and properly directed, to insure the perpetual
</p>
<p>happiness of each individual.
</p>
<p>To effect these important results, another and' a very different
</p>
<p>arrangement of society from that wliich has hitherto existed must
</p>
<p>now be made.
</p>
<p>The whole powers of the soil and of man must be brought into

</p>
<p>action ; no portion of either can remain dormant when population
</p>
<p>can be advanced to require the wastes and wildernesses of the
</p>
<p>earth, which are now, for want of cultivation, fruitful sources of
</p>
<p>disease and discomfort to man.
</p>
<p>But all our powers are now misapplied. The arrangements of
</p>
<p>society are random or chance proceedings, arising chiefly from
</p>
<p>the supposed private interests of one family, in opposition to all
</p>
<p>others. We, the producers of real wealth, have been, and now are, held
</p>
<p>in disesteem ; while the unproductive, useless, and injurious mem
</p>
<p>bers of society, riot to their own hurt in riches, and are trained to
</p>
<p>consider us their servants and slaves. By these ignorant and
</p>
<p>unnatural proceedings, the Earth and his own nature have been
</p>
<p>made the perpetual source of evil instead of good to man.
</p>
<p>We will, that this irrational state of society shall now cease,
</p>
<p>and that, henceforward, all, except those of the present generation
</p>
<p>too far advanced in life for the change, shall be trained to become
</p>
<p>producers of physical wealth or of intellectual gratification, and
</p>
<p>that none shall be maintained who are not occupied in producing
</p>
<p>or acquiring that wliich will benefit society, or be deemed equi
</p>
<p>valent to their consumption of its productions.
</p>
<p>We now know that all will become far better and happier, by
</p>
<p>babeuf's CONSPIRACY. 447
</p>
<p>D?inS made to be producers, physically or intellectually, or both,
</p>
<p>of the means of gratification to society, that they can be by living
</p>
<p>a life of idleness or uselessuess, and that the individual who is not
</p>
<p>trained, and afterwards employed to effect something beneficial to
</p>
<p>society, must be, of necessity, not merely a useless but a posi
</p>
<p>tively injurious member of the great family of mankind.
</p>
<p>That it is, therefore, the first duty of all governments to adopt
</p>
<p>national measures to train and place all the population of their
</p>
<p>respective dominions within such arrangements as shall make
</p>
<p>them physically, intellectually, and morally, useful members of
</p>
<p>society. But, to effect this change, an entire new organization of society
</p>
<p>is necessary. None of the professions, as they are now exercised,
</p>
<p>will be required ; nor can any of the present modes of transacting
</p>
<p>the business of life be retained. Instead of these errors of the old
</p>
<p>world, arrangements will be adopted to re-organize the whole of
</p>
<p>society, and to re-model the proceedings of mankind. We know
</p>
<p>that, whatever shaU be discovered and proved to be for the per-
</p>
<p>manent interest of the human race, will of necessity be carried
</p>
<p>into execution; and we know it to be for the permanent interest
</p>
<p>of the human race that the natural powers and faculties of each
</p>
<p>individual should be fully developed and brought into action for
</p>
<p>the direct benefit of all, that he himself may thereby be the most
</p>
<p>permanently benefitted.
</p>
<p>That each individual should be trained to become, as his natural
</p>
<p>faculties may direct, a producer of wealth, or of something of real
</p>
<p>value to society ; that is, of something that shall contribute to the
</p>
<p>well-being or happiness of some portion of the population ; or, in
</p>
<p>other words, as all may be trained to be useful or useless, no one
</p>
<p>shall he formed to become a worthless or useless member of our
</p>
<p>new social state.
</p>
<p>We also know that, by arrangements founded on these simple
</p>
<p>principles, the human race may he emancipated from ignorance
</p>
<p>and poverty, and, consequently, from sin and all its frightful train
</p>
<p>of miseries and evils innumerable.
</p>
<p>The union of these few principles, properly combined in prac

<p>tice, will constitute the foundation for a very superior local and
</p>
<p>general government of the human race; and the general business
</p>
<p>of society, which has been hitherto so complicated and perplexed,
</p>
<p>will become, as it ought to be, so plain that any individual may be
</p>
<p>trained easily to comprehend the principles, and to apply them
</p>
<p>advantageously to practice.
</p>
<p>We, therefore, now proclaim to ygu that a new era has com
</p>
<p>menced  one in which wealth of the most intrinsic value can be
</p>
<p>created to an unUmited extent, and in which the individuals ot
</p>
<p>the human race may be trained and educated to become beings
</p>
<p>possessing aU the good and superior qualities only which belong
</p>
<p>to their nature.
</p>
<p>And this era we do not hesitate to pronounce the commence
</p>
<p>ment of that period, which , under the term Millennium, the human
</p>
<p>race has been so long taught to expect.
</p>
<p>It is a period when all deception and artifice must cease when
</p>
<p>man will know and acknowledge the laws of his nature, and act
</p>
<p>in perfect accordance with them, and when, m consequence, he
</p>
<p>will become a natural and superior being.
</p>
<p>We invite you now to co-operate cordially with us to effect tins
</p>
<p>great and glorious change we invite you as relatives and friends,
</p>
<p>without desire to create hostile feeling of any description we
</p>
<p>448 babeuf's conspiracy.
</p>
<p>invite you purely from the affection which our newly acquired
</p>
<p>knowledge of our common nature has created within us. We
</p>
<p>dismiss all fear and suspicion, and all the inferior feelings which
</p>
<p>a system of error had generated and matured within us ; for we
</p>
<p>have now full confidence that we ourselves can attain these
</p>
<p>grand and noble results without the aid of any, and, notwithstanding
</p>
<p>the opposition of any, or all parties, whoever or whatever they
</p>
<p>may be. The old power of the old system of error is vanishing
</p>
<p>away as a mist disappears before the refulgent influence of the
</p>
<p>sun. It had no strength but that which it derived from public
</p>
<p>opinion, and from public opinion it can no longer obtain support.
</p>
<p>And why should any of you lament that public opinion is with
</p>
<p>drawn from giving power to an old system of error which has pro
</p>
<p>duced evil continually 1 Is there any one, from the occupier of
</p>
<p>the most powerful throne to the meanest individual of the lowest
</p>
<p>tribe, who is not most grievously injured by the necessary effects
</p>
<p>of this system ? It makes now, of all mankind, slaves to passions
</p>
<p>or to persons  a state of human existence which can never produce
</p>
<p>either virtue or happiness. Not one of you has a real interest in
</p>
<p>the longer support of this system ; but, on the contrary, your
</p>
<p>future happiness must arise from its now dying a natural death.
</p>
<p>Come, then, and for your own happiness, co-operate with us as
</p>
<p>friends. We are the producers of all the wealth and means of
</p>
<p>comfort you have hitherto possessed  we can make arrangements
</p>
<p>by which, in future, you may enjoy these good things in safety,
</p>
<p>and without fear ; but, were we so inclined, we could effectually
</p>
<p>withhold them from you and your children ; and force applied to
</p>
<p>us, would demonstrate only the weakness and folly of our mistaken
</p>
<p>opponents. The reign of terror, of carnal arms, or of physical
</p>
<p>force of' any kind or description iu opposition tc public opinion,
</p>
<p>has for ever ceased. It is now useless to speak of these old worn-
</p>
<p>out means to effect any great or permanent object. We discard
</p>
<p>them as being worse than useless ; as means of power gone by,
</p>
<p>never more to be called into action by beings claiming a rational
</p>
<p>nature. We call upon you to discard them also, and to turn your thoughts

<p>from the destruction of your fellow men, and of their wealth, to
</p>
<p>the acquisition of that knowledge which will enable you to assist
</p>
<p>materially to improve the former, and greatly to increase the
</p>
<p>amount of the latter. To act thus is your duty and your interest,
</p>
<p>for it is the only course that can insure you permanent satisfaction,
</p>
<p>or that can now give you a chance of happiness.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, we again earnestly call upon you to unite cor
</p>
<p>dially with us in measures 
</p>
<p>First, To produce a surplus of all kinds of wealth.
</p>
<p>Second, To distribute wealth the most beneficially for all parties
</p>
<p>in all countries.
</p>
<p>Third, To form a superior character for the rising generation,
</p>
<p>and to improve the adults of the present generation.
</p>
<p>Fourth, To govern well and wisely for all parties.
</p>
<p>Fifth, And to form arrangements to carry these measures into
</p>
<p>immediate execution, to stop the evident progress daily making
</p>
<p>toward a revolution of violence.
