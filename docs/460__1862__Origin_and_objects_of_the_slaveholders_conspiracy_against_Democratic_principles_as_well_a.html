</p>
<p>The coinmentaric-s on the recent speeches of Col. Hamilton, of Texas, by several prominent New York j"ur-
</p>
<p>nolists, furnish appropriate introduction to the outlines of those speeches which are herewith preaenied for the oon-
</p>
<p>Bideration of loyal men of all parties throughout the land.
</p>
<p>It will be seen that, much as they may diti'er in other respects, T?ie World <S> Courier & Enquirer, the Tribune,
</p>
<p>the 'Jimes. and ihe Eveitivg Post. ( oucur in ranking those speeches among the most important ever made in con-
</p>
<p> K , with the origin and objects of the Slavtholders' R'i'bellion.
</p>
<p>' On some points, indeed, the revelations nt Col Hamilton are considered as the most valuable inasmuch as
</p>
<p>they show, by the highest Southern testimony, the breadth, dci'th, and blackness of that conspiracy against the
</p>
<p>individual rights of the Democratic mass^ s. as well as against the integrity of the National Union.
</p>
<p>"The Northern People have accepted this war on t"oo narrow grounds altogether," says The World <& Courier
</p>
<p>& EnqvArer :  ''They have comprehended but a very meagre portion of the real interests at stake for the very
</p>
<p>good reason that they have hardly begun to understand the spirit and aims of the Rebel leaders. Had there been a
</p>
<p>better appreciation of the actual truth, the war would never have lagged as it has been suffered to do from the
</p>
<p>beginning."
</p>
<p>" The evidence of such men as Col. Hamiltn, who is fresh from the active scenes of the Rebellion, and who has
</p>
<p>watched it with penetrating eye from its flr.^t step, is of peculiar value,'" says the World in its daily issue of the 4th
</p>
<p>of October. "Their conclusions, formed on the spot, face to face with the m..nster. are ofinflnitely more wci:;ht than
</p>
<p>the no'ions of Northern men, who know it only by occa.ional glimpses in the far distance. It is well that their tes-
</p>
<p>timony should be brought before our public whenever it can be obtained. The gentl; m n who have induced Col.
</p>
<p>Hamilton to address our people with instruction and appeal, have done the good cause precious service." * * *
</p>
<p>"Col. Hamilton has no hesitation in pronouncing the issue now pending to he the teky nronEST, and broadbst
</p>
<p>AKD DEEPEST possible. It is, to his mind, nothing more uor less than a stucgglk between the itltimatb pein-
</p>
<p>ciPLES OF CIVIL oovT.nNirr.NT a question whether the rvle f the few or the rule of the many shall prevail. He

</p>
<p>LANT POPULAR GOVERNMENT and ESTABLISH A MO.NAROHY and that tliis comes from their belief
</p>
<p>that Slavery can have no effectual safeguard fxcept what the strongest for tn of goveritinent can aford. Th' t-e-
</p>
<p>fore, he warns us notto rest upon the idea that mere territory, or even mere nationality, is at .stake in 'his coufliet "
</p>
<p>"What has really got to be decided, as he justly views it," adds the World, "is, not whether the flag itself shall
</p>
<p>be deprived of a third of its stars, or whether the flag itself shall continue to exist, but xcheher the liepubUcatL
</p>
<p>priTH-iple, which has given the flag all its glory, is or is not to perish. He rightly declares that the co-existence of
</p>
<p>a Monarchy and a Republic between the Great Lakes and the Gulf is a civil impossibility that such an experiment
</p>
<p>would only be another name for pjerpetval tear.
</p>
<p>" We are, thcref re, shut up to the absolute necessity of meeting this question now, once fi)r all," continues the
</p>
<p>TTorW "and, in fideli'y to the ereat principles of the Declaration of Independence which our forefathers sealed
</p>
<p>with their blood, are bound to prosecu'e this war with an energy an-! a se'f-devoion far beyond anything we have
</p>
<p>yet displayed. These j>re great facts which Col. Hamilton seeks to enforce. He talks like a ra'sn who is thoroughly
</p>
<p>pervaded by a sense o^ eir awful moment  and no mind that heeds his disclosures and his arguments can doubt
</p>
<p>that he is right." ; '
</p>
<p>Profoundly impri d with the s"me vifws that Col Hamilton his now forcibly illustrated by his speeches in
</p>
<p>Hew York and Krook.,. , tbe Dkmoobatio League tor sustaining tuk National Unity has earnestly la'iored for
</p>
<p>several months in disa linating documents replete with facts and arguments on the import nt topics. Andsonie
</p>
<p>of those import;int doq nents are now republished in coiinecticn with the speeches ot Col. Hamilton, as sliowing
</p>
<p>the identity of views | 'tween the Colonel and that League one of whose most .tlici. nt inemb rs (Lorenzo Sher-
</p>
<p>wood) was a resident i .id a legislator in Texas, and a co-worker with Col. Hamilton in sustaining the National
</p>
<p>Government in Texas, till its flag and its forces were betrayed by the General (Twi::gs) whom the then War Sec-
</p>
<p>retary Floyd placed in command as an emissary of Rebellion.
</p>
<p>As the importance of the topics cannot be ovcr-estimati-d, it is hoped that men of all parties will thorouehly
</p>
<p>exomine these and other luiblie .tions calculated to pl.ace the origin and objects of the Slaveholders' Conspiracy in
</p>
<p>their true light as an attempted revolution not only in the Union of the States, but in therela'ions of the Democratic
</p>
<p>masses to the government of their country  that each man may act and vote as becomes an American citizen in
</p>
<p>view (if the fact whiih Col. Hamilton concurs with the I>emocratic League in asserting, that " the leaders in this
</p>
<p>"Rebellion are actuated by a distinct purpose to supplant popu'ar government and establish a monarchy: and that
</p>
<p>" this comes from their belief that Sl.aviry can have no effctual safeguard except whit the strongest govorument
</p>
<p>"can afford;" or. as Mr. Giru'^tt, of Virgini.i, in hisl.-ttei to Trescott (.Mr Buchanan's A-^si.stant Secretary .f State),
</p>
<p>expresses it, when "objecting to "the term ]>emoerat," because, as slaveholders decided, ^'Democracy, in its

</p>
<p>THE SPEECHE'S OF COL. HAIMILTON, OF TEXAS.
</p>
<p>(From the " World and Courier and Enquirer," of Oct. 4  ^friendly to Seymour.)
</p>
<p>The greatest difficultj\ from the outset, in
</p>
<p>the way of a just appreciation by the North
</p>
<p>of the real nature of this rebellion, has been
</p>
<p>the fact that the loyal men who knew ruost of
</p>
<p>it were least able to give their testimony.
</p>
<p>The last echoes of the cannon at Sumter had
</p>
<p>hardly died away before the communications
</p>
<p>between the two sections were closed ; and the
</p>
<p>northern mind was left to only casual and de-
</p>
<p>sultory means of learning the developments of
</p>
<p>the'Astounding iniquity.
</p>
<p>The consequence was that it was very slow
</p>
<p>to apprehend the real malignity and scope of
</p>
<p>the treason. The Government and the people
</p>
<p>generally were disposed to regard it as a wild
</p>
<p>movement cunningly got up by a few restless
</p>
<p>spirits, and easily quelled. The driblets of
</p>
<p>information that came over the rebel borders
</p>
<p>were so indefinite and contradictory that they
</p>
<p>served only* to confuse and mislead.
</p>
<p>It has been by terrible experience alone that
</p>
<p>northern raisjudgments have gradually been
</p>
<p>corrected  an experience that has cost the
</p>
<p>country an amount of treasure and blood
</p>
<p>dreadful to contemplate. And yet, in spite of
</p>
<p>all this, a thousand misconceptions still exist.
</p>
<p>There is yet a widely prevailing tendency
</p>
<p>to ascribe the rebellion to mere secondary and
</p>
<p>minor causes, and to believe that it will cost
</p>
<p>only a little more effort to sweep it from the
</p>
<p>land forever.
</p>
<p>The habit still clings of reasoning from the

</p>
<p>old data. We unconsciously base half of our
</p>
<p>judgments upon facts as they used to be, in-
</p>
<p>stead of facts as they are. This comes from
</p>
<p>the difficulty of correctly learning present de-
</p>
<p>Telopments.
</p>
<p>Therefore, the evidence of such men as Col.
</p>
<p>Hamilton, who is fiesh from the active scenes
</p>
<p>of the rebellion, and who has watched it with
</p>
<p>penetrating eye from its first step, is of peculiar
</p>
<p>value. Their conclusions, formed on the very
</p>
<p>spot, face to face with the monster, are of infi-
</p>
<p>nitely more weight than the notions of north-
</p>
<p>em men who know it only by occasional
</p>
<p>glimpses in the far distance. It is well that
</p>
<p>their testimony should be brought before our
</p>
<p>public whenever it can be obtained. The
</p>
<p>gentlemen who have induced Colonel Hamilton
</p>
<p>to address our people with instruction and ap-
</p>
<p>peal, have done the good cause precious ser-
</p>
<p>vice. Winging their way, as these speeches
</p>
<p>do, by the press, through every loj^al state,
</p>
<p>they will have a salutary influence of no small
</p>
<p>moment in the present critical period of the
</p>
<p>war.
</p>
<p>Colonel Hamilton has no hesitation in pro-
</p>
<p>nouncing the issue now pending to be the very
</p>
<p>highest, and broadest, and deepest possible.
</p>
<p>It is to his mind nothing more nor less than
</p>
<p>a struggle between the ultimate principles of
</p>
<p>civil Government  a question whether the rule
</p>
<p>of the few, or the rule of the many, shall pre-
</p>
<p>vail. He presents it as his settled conviction
</p>
<p>that the leaders iu this rebellion are actuated
</p>
<p>by a distinct purpose to supplant popular gov-
</p>
<p>ernment and establish a monarchy; and that

</p>
<p>Hon. a J. Hamilton.  Dear Sir : As it is
</p>
<p>understood that you are to remain in town
</p>
<p>some few days, it would be gratifying to the
</p>
<p>friends of the Union if you would consent to
</p>
<p>address an audience at the Academy of Music,
</p>
<p>in Brooklyn, on Thursday evening, the 2d of
</p>
<p>October inst., on the subject of the rebellion.
</p>
<p>We know of no one who could better elucidate
</p>
<p>the motives and reasonings that led the politi-
</p>
<p>cal adventurers South into attempted revolu-
</p>
<p>tion. By complying with this request, you
</p>
<p>will confer many obligations on your sympa-
</p>
<p>thizing fellow-citizens of the North.
</p>
<p>Very truly, yours, <tc.

<p>New York, Oct. 1, 1862.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen : I am in receipt of your note of
</p>
<p>this date, inviting me to deliver an address
</p>
<p>at the Academy of Music, in Brooklyn, on next
</p>
<p>Thursday evening. I accept the invitation and
</p>
<p>tender my thanks for your kindness and sym-
</p>
<p>pathy. Very truly, yours,
</p>
<p>A. J. HAMILTON.
</p>
<p>Aaron L. Reid, and others, Committee.
</p>
<p>The Brooklyn Academy of Music was
</p>
<p>thronged accordingly by an enthusiastic au-
</p>
<p>dience eager to welcome the eminent Union
</p>
<p>refugee from Texas, the Hon. A. J. Hamilton,
</p>
<p>ex-Member of Congress from that State, who
</p>
<p>had been invited to speak on The Cause, the
</p>
<p>Consequence, and the Cure of the Rebellion.
</p>
<p>The stage was crowded with the leading citi-
</p>
<p>zens of the Sober City. Mr. Hamilton was in-
</p>
<p>troduced by A. A. Low, Esq. He was received
</p>
<p>with loud and prolonged applause.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hamilton said : Ladies and Gentlemen
</p>
<p>of Brooklyn, at the threshold of the remarks
</p>
<p>that I shall submit to you this evening upon
</p>
<p>the gravest subject which in my judgment has
</p>
<p>ever yet addressed itself to a free people, per-
</p>
<p>mit me to say, in one word, I thank you for
</p>
<p>thiis reception, [Cheers.] I thank you, fel-
</p>
<p>low-citizens (permit me to call you), not be-
</p>
<p>cause of personal gratification at the manifest-
</p>
<p>ation you made this evening of your loyalty,
</p>
<p>and your appreciation of loyalty in others, but
</p>
<p>because, if you will allow the expression, it
</p>
<p>will be received, if indeed it shall ever reach
</p>
<p>them, by thousands as loyal as I, in my dis-
</p>
<p>tracted country, as a just and proper compli-

</p>
<p>belonged) coiilil bring to boar upon the piin-
</p>
<p>ciples upon which their Govoninient was to
</p>
<p>be based, as contrasted -with tlie Government
</p>
<p>of the United States.* He euid tliere was no
</p>
<p>man ufio deserved the name of statesman in the
</p>
<p>South, who would pretend that Seces.iio7i was
</p>
<p>cavaed bi/ any aggrcxnion of the North upon the
</p>
<p>rights of the people of the South. He said it
</p>
<p>was still less the result of any act of oppres-
</p>
<p>sion on the part of the United States Govern-
</p>
<p>ment What then Avas the reason? He said
</p>
<p>it wns because of the difFerence in the oi'gani-
</p>
<p>zation of Bociely North and South. It was
</p>
<p>because in the non-slaveholding States, from
</p>
<p>the fact that every man was a freeman, you
</p>
<p>were necessarily Democratic; every man be-
</p>
<p>ing a freeman, it resulted that the labcring
</p>
<p>cliiss in the non-slaveliolding States had the
</p>
<p>power in the Government, and it required but
</p>
<p>little argument to prove tliat when that was
</p>
<p>the case, the Government was in the heels of
</p>
<p>society, because labor was always in excess of
</p>
<p>the direction of labor; tiiat is to say, tliere
</p>
<p>were more laboiing men, and there would con-
</p>
<p>tinue to be, than there were men who bj' means
</p>
<p>of their capital directed labor. He said when
</p>
<p>Government w^as in the hands of those w'ho
</p>
<p>direct labor alone, it was in the head of socie-
</p>
<p>ty, where it properly belonged. And now,
</p>
<p>said he, having cut loose from the North, have

<p>meeting the objects of the revolution, because
</p>
<p>it had not provided for reopening tlie Afiican

<p>slave-trade. Said he, it will involve the ne-

<p>oessitj' f another revolution. Here is the evil ;
</p>
<p>here are the laboring men, and they are in the
</p>
<p>majority, too, wlio wield the power in the
</p>
<p>Government. They vote at tlie ballot-box,
</p>
<p>and from the premises that I have laid down
</p>
<p>you will perceive that slavery and Democracj'
</p>
<p>are incompatible. [Loud eheering.]

<p>He paid a high compliment to the great
</p>
<p>New York statesman who is now the Secreta-
</p>

</p>
<p>for lie gave him credit for being great, never
</p>
<p>uttered a greater truth than when he said
</p>
<p>there was an irrepressible conflict between the
</p>
<p>two systems of society. [Great applause.]
</p>
<p>And, said he, in this additional, this second
</p>
<p>revolution, that will be forced upon us, al-
</p>
<p>though it may be bloodier than tlie one in

<p>Well, fellow-citizens, if tliat was the senti-

<p>whatever it may have been, which I had en-
</p>
<p>joyed ; it was hard to part with wife and
</p>
<p>children ; it was hard to leave home without
</p>
<p>knowledge that I would ever return. But I
</p>
<p>had something to sustain me in this  I had
</p>
<p>true and loyal friends, who gave me moral
</p>
<p>aid and comfort; it may be that some of these
</p>
<p>may fall away from me now, because my miud
</p>
<p>may be led to a conclusion which they are not
</p>
<p>yet prepared for, but to which they are just
</p>
<p>as certain to arrive as I have arrived at it to-
</p>
<p>night.
</p>
<p>Mr. Spratt says, then, that this revolution
</p>
<p>was not because the' spirit of the Northern
</p>
<p>people was aiJjL^ressive, it was not the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment of the United States was ag;jressive, but
</p>
<p>because the very framework of society here would,
</p>
<p>if left free to grapple with slavery, destroy it
</p>
<p>by moral force.
</p>
<p>Whether that view is the precise one that
</p>
<p>has influeueed those who have engaged in the
</p>
<p>rebellion of tiie South or not, they have been
</p>
<p>sufficiently convinced of one fact, that the in-
</p>
<p>fluence of non-slaveholders in the new Govern-
</p>
<p>ment was to be felt less and less year by year,
</p>
<p>until at last they should be reduced to the con-
</p>
<p>dition of serfs, and that the slaveholder, and he
</p>
<p>alone, should govern the country.
</p>
<p>Now, while two years ago I would not have
</p>
<p>lent my ai i to a man who was seeking the de-
</p>
<p>Btruetion of slavery  while I would have re-
</p>
<p>garded him as an impracticable friend of the

<p>in collision the spirit which opposed slavery
</p>
<p>with slavery  while I did believe that our
</p>
<p>fathers who framed the Government under-
</p>
<p>stood well how to avoid trouble on the one
</p>
<p>hand and inevitable difficulty on the other, j
</p>
<p>am not prepared to see that system used for
</p>
<p>the purpose of perpetuating itself, and, in the
</p>
<p>ama ratio that it is elevated, my children de-
</p>
<p>pressed. The question has been changed. It
</p>
<p>is not^what it was two years ago. There was
</p>
<p>no party then who sought more than simply
</p>
<p>to protect slavery under the laws, and when
</p>
<p>the expei'imeut of secession was being entered
</p>
<p>upon, I said to them: Do not eater upon it.
</p>
<p>If you do, you will inevitably destroy the in-
</p>
<p>Btitulion ; it is laying the knife to the throat of
</p>
<p>tlavery. You are in the habit of saying that
</p>
<p>I am not sound upon the subject. I would
</p>
<p>eave you from the very influeace which you
</p>
<p>pretend to dread. You cannot, against the
</p>
<p>moral force and power of all Christendom, sus-
</p>
<p>tain that institution, saving and excepting un-
</p>
<p>der the protection of the United States Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment. [Cheers.] It is because the opposi-
</p>
<p>tion to it elsewhere throughout the world, in
</p>
<p>view of the immeasvirable blessings the United
</p>
<p>States Government is affording to humanity,
</p>
<p>dare not, on account of that one blot, if they
</p>
<p>conceive it to be so, attack the integrity of that
</p>
<p>Government; but when you shall have risked
</p>
<p>the alternative of destroying that Government
</p>
<p>for slavery, and seek to build a Government up-
</p>
<p>on slavery, as its chief corner-alone, you then
</p>
<p>challenge the public opposition of the world to

<p>participation, to give your countenance. Let
</p>
<p>the madmen, who are seeking the ruin of the
</p>
<p>State, go to the polls alone.
</p>
<p>So in many of the States not a third of the
</p>
<p>vote of tlie State -was cast. That was the case
</p>
<p>in my own State. In Louisiana it is now
</p>
<p>known that there were a majority of the votes
</p>
<p>cast against secession. At many of the polls
</p>
<p>were posters saying: " Let the vote he open,
</p>
<p>that we may see who are the traitors,"  and
</p>
<p>the Union-men dared not vote.
</p>
<p>You may say that these Union-men did not
</p>
<p>care for their liberty so much as their fathers
</p>
<p>did. Gentlemen, most of us prefer reading
</p>
<p>about martyrs to beiug martyrs; and I would
</p>
<p>myself rather be a martyr in some other way
</p>
<p>than to have a rough rope put around my neck,
</p>
<p>and be hung on a lonely prairie, and have mj'
</p>
<p>body left there unburied.
</p>
<p>You ask, has this happened ? Aye, fellow-
</p>
<p>citizens, it has happened ; it is happening every
</p>
<p>day ; it will continue to liappen until the last
</p>
<p>free spirit has left the South, or his soul has been
</p>
<p>crushed, unless the power of this Government
</p>
<p>steps in. [Cheers.] It commenced before se-

<p>If he were to be martyred for expressing
</p>
<p>the opinions which "Washington expressed, no
</p>
<p>such Union for him.
</p>
<p>Now, he alleged, that the issue was deliber-
</p>
<p>ately tendered, of slavery on one si'le, and
</p>
<p>freedom for the white race upon the other.
</p>
<p>He spoke on behalf of the once enfranchised
</p>
<p>free white man of the South, Whether sla-
</p>
<p>very was compatible with Democracy or not,
</p>
<p>the leaders of the rebellion intended to save

<p>slavery, whether Democracy was saved or not.

<p>If we did not accept the issue, it would be

<p>The liberties of the North were inseperably

<p>republicanism should be maintained, even at
</p>
<p>the hazard of a foreign war, clear down to tha

<p>COL. HAMILTON'S SECOND SPEECH
</p>
<p>ON THE CAUSES AND OBJECTS OF THE REBELLION.
</p>
<p>THE ARISTOCRATIC ARM OF THE REBELLION.
</p>
<p>Li response to an invitation of the National
</p>
<p>War Committee, the Hon. A. J. Hamilton, the
</p>
<p>eloquent Union refugee from Texas, delivered
</p>
<p>an address in the large Hall of Cooper Institute
</p>
<p>last evening (Oct. 4). The hall was densely
</p>
<p>filled. Upon the platform were David Dudley
</p>
<p>Field, the Hon. Hiram Walbridge, Prof. Francis
</p>
<p>Lieber, the Rev. Henry M. Field, Profs. J. J.
</p>
<p>Owen and Roswell C. Hitchcock, Brig.-Gen.
</p>
<p>Strong, S. B. Chittenden, and others. At li
</p>
<p>o'clock Gen. Hiram Walbridge called the meet-
</p>
<p>ing to order. He said 
</p>
<p>Fellow-Citizens: The National War Com-
</p>
<p>mittee have assigned to me the duty of calling
</p>
<p>to order this vast patriotic and intelligent as-
</p>
<p>semblage. Without office, without honors,
</p>
<p>without emoluments, without patronage, they
</p>
<p>trace their authority only in the rectitude of
</p>
<p>their intention, in the imminence of public
</p>
<p>danger, and they fondly trust in the regaixl
</p>
<p>and esteem of their countrymen. [Cheers.]
</p>
<p>No sane man believes that this gigantic rebel-
</p>
<p>lion, which fairly shakes the earth beneath our
</p>
<p>feet, can ever be quelled unless the Federal
</p>
<p>Government shall furnish the opportunity for
</p>
<p>the loyal patriotic Union men of the South
</p>
<p>to demonstrate their valor, their in-
</p>
<p>trepidity, their devotion to the Constitution,
</p>
<p>the Union, and the supremacy of law. [Ap-
</p>

<p>ment it guarantees sprung from the hearts of

<p>the American people. It was baptized in their
</p>
<p>blood, and it will be defended by their hands
</p>
<p>so long as treason shall seek to ignore that
</p>
<p>flag that has borne the glories of the Amer-
</p>
<p>ican character into every part of the habitable
</p>
<p>globe. [Great applause.] I take the liberty,
</p>
<p>therefore, gentlemen, of respectfully nominat-
</p>
<p>ing as presiding officer upon the occasion, our
</p>
<p>eminent chief magistrate, the Hon. George
</p>
<p>Opdyke. [Loud and prolongid applause.]
</p>
<p>, Mayor Opdyke said: My friends, we are
</p>
<p>here to listen to a distinguished citizen of the
</p>
<p>South, a friend of the Union, and of the old
</p>
<p>flag, who has been compelled to flee from the
</p>
<p>iron despotism which the confederate traitors
</p>
<p>have established there. It is therefore that
</p>
<p>we are favored with the opportunity of obtain-
</p>
<p>ing infoi-mation from that region from a soui'ce
</p>
<p>at once so trustworthy, so enlightened, and so
</p>
<p>eloquent Tho orator of the evening is a gen-
</p>
<p>tleman of distinguished social position, and
</p>
<p>eminent public service, having represented his
</p>
<p>State in the Congress of the United States
</p>
<p>with marked ability, and I trust the day is not
</p>
<p>far distant when he will again be called upon
</p>
<p>to serve his fellow-citizens in the same capac-
</p>
<p>ity. I present to you the Honorable A. J.
</p>
<p>Hamilton, of Texas. [Enthusiastic and contin-
</p>
<p>ued applause.]
</p>
<p>Mr. Hamilton said: Fellow-citizens of the
</p>
<p>City of New York, could I, by the exercise of
</p>
<p>some supernatural poAver, present to those I
</p>
<p>left behind the scene upon which I now gaze,
</p>
<p>and bring back the answer which springs in
</p>
<p>every heart that throbs with a loyal feeling,

<p>told them that they would make him not only
</p>
<p>an Abolition pympathizer, but an active, prac-
</p>
<p>tical Abolitionist. [Enthusiastic clieering.]
</p>
<p>He feared that tht-re were those here who still
</p>
<p>fancied that by some conciliatory measures the
</p>
<p>South could be brouglit back to the oM Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment. There could be uo gjreater fallacy.
</p>
<p>[Applause.] The loyal men of the South were
</p>
<p>praying to get back into the Union without any
</p>
<p>condition or conciliation. Would any loyal
</p>
<p>men consent that Jeff. Davis should ever be
</p>
<p>President of the United States. [" No, no."]
</p>
<p>Mr. Hamilton continued: "I do want to see
</p>
<p>the old Government, when it shall have assert-
</p>
<p>ed its power, make a wise and just discrimina-
</p>
<p>tion between the guilty and the deluded.

</p>
<p>ti'odden, the sutfering, the ignorant, to be al-
</p>
<p>lowed to come back like the prodigal son, and
</p>
<p>be forgiven. [Cheers.]
</p>
<p>IS we cannot conciliate these men what can
</p>
<p>we do? Shall history record it that twenty-
</p>
<p>seven millions of freemen, and women, and
</p>
<p>children have not the moral and phj'sical power
</p>
<p>to strangle treason in fifteen hundred thousand ?
</p>
<p>Is republicanism to fail upon this continent
</p>
<p>because that twenty-seven millions are not suf-
</p>
<p>ficiently conscious of their duty to themselves,
</p>
<p>to the Governm-nt of thrir fathers, to human-
</p>
<p>ity the wide world over, to realize the fact that

<p>but they will not come in the shape of an un-
</p>
<p>conditional proposition to assume the Union
</p>
<p>as it was, leaving the elective franchise as it
</p>
<p>was.
</p>
<p>We have already seen some of the conditions,
</p>
<p>or what would probably be the condiiio^s, if
</p>
<p>hostilities were to cease. I do not think tiiat
</p>
<p>they even would emanate from the Cabinet 
</p>
<p>if I may be allowed the expression  at Rich-
</p>
<p>mond. They know that if the Government of
</p>
<p>tlie United States should, in its mercy, pardon
</p>
<p>their offenses, and restore them to their rights
</p>
<p>under the Constitution, their own fellow-citi-
</p>
<p>zens who have been their victims would spurn
</p>
<p>them away, and ihey are as effectually cut off
</p>
<p>from preferment as if they had been convicted
</p>
<p>of high treason. The very desperation with
</p>
<p>which they are struggling ought to prov* to
</p>
<p>you and the world that they will never stop
</p>
<p>while they can get men to bleed; they will
</p>
<p>never cease to fight as long as there is a hope
</p>
<p>of success, because it is the onl\' hope of salva-
</p>
<p>tion to them. They do not feel for the suffcr-
</p>
<p>ijigs of the wives and the children that are
</p>
<p>made widows and orphans by tliis unholy war;
</p>
<p>it never has entered the mind of one man in

<p>tliis rebellion, who understood its objects, to
</p>
<p>shed a tear for all the bloodshed, misery and

<p>woe which it involved.
</p>
<p>The war must be put down by bayonets, by

<p>powder and ball, by brave hearts and strong

</p>
<p>And yet, fellow-citizens, for these brief de-

<p>further tried. Friends doubtless who have
</p>

<p>THE PLOTTINGS OF REBELLION.

<p>THE PLOITINGS OF EEBELLIOK
</p>
<p>THE ISSUE m ITS MAGNITUDE.
</p>
<p>Eleven years ago, a leading spirit of Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia addressed a leading spirit of South Car-
</p>
<p>olina, and distinctly presented the great issue of
</p>
<p>to-day. The following letter, written in 18.51,
</p>
<p>by Mr. Garnett, then a member of the Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia Convention sitting to revise the Consti-
</p>
<p>tution of the State, to Mr. Trescott, of South
</p>
<p>Carolina, afterwards Assistant Secretary, of
</p>
<p>State under Mr. Buchanan, ia fully significant
</p>
<p>of the matured designs of the secessionists.
</p>
<p>This letter was captured at the residence of
</p>
<p>Mr. Trescott, on Barnwell's Island, and con-
</p>
<p>tains the reasonings ftnd motives of the traitors
</p>
<p>who inaugurated the rebellion. The meaning
</p>
<p>of the letter is clear on its face. It needs no
</p>
<p>commentary. We ask our fellow-Democrats
</p>
<p>to read and ponder it. As Democrats, we
</p>
<p>accept the issue as the traitors themselves
</p>
<p>understand it  as we understand it, and as the
</p>
<p>leading rebels who control the South have
</p>
<p>FORCED it on the nation  Slavery and De-
</p>
<p>mocracy incompatible ! Which shall go under ?
</p>
<p>Let true Democrats answer the question.

<p>LETTER OF THE DEMOCEATIC LEAGUE TO JOHN BRIGHT.
</p>
<p>The following letter from the Executive
</p>
<p>Committee of the Democratic League, alluding
</p>
<p>to the antagonisms in which the rebellion orig-
</p>
<p>inated, has been addressed to John Bright,

<p>Manchester, England:

<p>" New York, August 9, 1862.
</p>
<p>'^ John Bright, member of the British Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>" Dear Sir : The Executive Committee of
</p>
<p>the Democratic League for Sustaining the Na-
</p>
<p>tional Unity, influenced by a just admiration
</p>
<p>of the character you have earned in this coun-
</p>
<p>try as well as your own, desire to tender to
</p>
<p>you the respects and regards of our fellow-
</p>
<p>countrymen. "We do not arrogate too much
</p>
<p>when we speak in behalf of our fellow-citizens ;
</p>
<p>for, at best, we can but feebly express the kind-
</p>
<p>ly sentiments which the millions on this side
</p>
<p>of the Atlantic entertain towards you.
</p>
<p>" It is enough for us to know that you are
</p>
<p>the warm and fii-m friend of the masses of your
</p>
<p>own countrymen. Knowing this, we can ap-
</p>
<p>preciate your habits of thought and your readi-
</p>
<p>ness to analj'ze correctly the causes that have
</p>
<p>led to the present conflict in America. No one
</p>
<p>who is not imbued with a large and kindly
</p>
<p>sympathy for the welfare of the masses is com-
</p>
<p>petent to be a judge in our matters. There is
</p>
<p>no other platform than this upon which he
</p>
<p>can stand and make his survey accurate. Hav-
</p>
<p>ing analyzed society in the United States from

<p>the same stand-point that you have contem-

<p>ANTAGONISTIC PKINCIPLES INVOLYED IN THE REBELLION.
</p>
<p>of the Democratic principle, and the laws of
</p>
<p>population and subsistence, slavery must soon
</p>
<p>lose its presti-ce and go dowu before tlie en-
</p>
<p>frauchised masses.' What was to be done?
</p>
<p>Here was a process of reasoning, founded on
</p>
<p>foresight of the future, that no argument could
</p>
<p>turn aside. Statesmen in the North and South
</p>
<p>concurred in the same conclusion, but with
</p>
<p>this difference  the one insisting that the dem-
</p>
<p>ocratic principle must be subverted in order
</p>
<p>to maintain slavery unimparod  the other in-
</p>
<p>sisting that the democratic principle in Gov-
</p>
<p>ernment must be maintained, though it in-
</p>
<p>volved the extinction of slavery. We have
</p>
<p>now the desperate conflict of arms founded
</p>
<p>upon the issue thus made.
</p>
<p>" Our people of the North dreaded civil
</p>
<p>war. Every interest had aversion to the resort
</p>
<p>to arms. Every assurance was given that
</p>
<p>slavery would not be intermeddled with in
</p>
<p>states where it existed. Compromises were
</p>
<p>offered and attempted to be acted on ; and
</p>
<p>everything short of a surrender of the demo-
</p>
<p>cratic principle in Government was tendered
</p>
<p>to slaveholders in order to assuage animosity
</p>
<p>and put back the intended revolution. Our
</p>
<p>national Government and the party in power
</p>
<p>did everything possible in conciliatory policy,
</p>
<p>but with no other result than that of increased
</p>
<p>determination on the part of slaveholders to
</p>
<p>persist in the purposes of the rebellion. Slave-
</p>
<p>holders were not mistaken in their conclusion,
</p>
<p>that there was a danger to the institution of

</p>
<p>slavery which no compromises could avert,
</p>
<p>and against which no party' could stipulate or
</p>
<p>give guaranty. Tliey knew that the frictional
</p>
<p>contest must soon arise under the laws of pop-
</p>
<p>ulation and subsistence. Twenty-three years
</p>
<p>hence, on the ratio of the past, and the popu-
</p>
<p>lation would be aggregated to sixty millions.
</p>
<p>Forty-six years would swell it to a hundred
</p>
<p>and twenty. But a short time in the auuals
</p>
<p>of nationality, and slavery would be crowded
</p>
<p>by the offshoot of that twenty-seven millions
</p>
<p>now dependent upon free labor for subsistence,
</p>
<p>and having every natural motive to political
</p>
<p>affiliation. This was the mountain of horrors
</p>
<p>to the pro-slavery sensibilities. This was the
</p>
<p>political power that politicians could not bind
</p>
<p>or warp into subordination to the purposes
</p>
<p>and policy of slavery.
</p>
<p>" To glance further at the logic which preci-
</p>
<p>pitated the slaveholders into rebellion, they as-
</p>
<p>sumed that delay only added to the difficulties
</p>
<p>of successfully accomplishing a revolution.
</p>
<p>They had prepared the programme in 1856;
</p>
<p>and had also arranged for going out of tiie
</p>
<p>Union in case Mr. Fremont was elected to the
</p>
<p>Presidency. The election of Mr. Buchanan at
</p>
<p>the time merely postponed the attempt, in
</p>
<p>order to gain additional facilities for success
</p>
<p>through the treasonable pliancy of his admin-
</p>
<p>istration. With a traitorous majority in Mr.
</p>
<p>Buchanan's Cabinet, the work of rebel prepa-
</p>
<p>ration went rapidly on. Mr. Lincoln's inaugu-
</p>
<p>ration found it fully prepared for the conflict

<p>do not imagine that the intelligence of Great

<p>tion of this diabolical attempt to injure society
</p>
<p>at large. That we were powerless to prevent
</p>

<p>is plainly evident. That we have not succeeded

<p>in Great Britain towards ourselves, is to be re-
</p>
<p>gretted ; more especially as we have suffered

<p>most deeply from the same causes. It will not
</p>
<p>be expected, under our trying circumstances
</p>
<p>even, that we can forego the preservation of

<p>nationality, and consent to the prostration of
</p>
<p>our great cause, for the temporary convenience

<p>of the best friends we have in the world.
</p>

<p>for its alleviation, we do not believe that it

<p>LIBERTY FOR WHITE MEN.
</p>
<p>(From the N. T. Evening Post of Oct. 4.)
</p>
<p>There are three classes of men in the States
</p>
<p>now held by the rebels  the slaveholders, the
</p>
<p>slaves, and the non-slaveholding whites. The
</p>
<p>slaveholders are the originators and leaders in
</p>
<p>the rebellion ; they make the slaves support
</p>
<p>them in their crime, and the poor whites to
</p>
<p>fight for them. The slaves number over three
</p>
<p>millions ; tlie poor whites nearly five millions;
</p>
<p>the slaveholders less than four hundred thou-
</p>
<p>sand. The slaves are ignorant; the poor whites
</p>
<p>are for the most part little better informed ;
</p>
<p>the slaveholders alone, as a class, have monop-
</p>
<p>olized in the South, for many years, edu(!ation,
</p>
<p>wealth, and political influence. In some of the
</p>
<p>Southern States only slaveholders were per-
</p>
<p>mitted to hold office ; in others, as in Virginia,
</p>
<p>the peculiar property of the slaveholders was
</p>
<p>represented in the legislature, and balanced the
</p>
<p>votes of the non-slaveholders. With wealth,

</p>
<p>education, and the social and political power
</p>
<p>already in their hands, this mischievous class
</p>
<p>did not find it difficult to seize also the liber-
</p>
<p>ties of the poor whites  the non-slaveholders.
</p>
<p>Colonel Hamilton, of Texas, told his hearers
</p>
<p>some evenings ago, that w^, Avho support the
</p>
<p>Government, fight not only for ourselves, but
</p>
<p>for the non-slaveholding whites of the South 
</p>
<p>to redeem them from the serfhood in which
</p>
<p>they are held by the slaveholders ; to regain
</p>
<p>for them the liberties snatched from them ; to
</p>
<p>save them from the fate which is before them,
</p>
<p>of being made the victims of a cruel despotism.
</p>
<p>But he added, what is equally true, that ow
</p>
<p>liberty will fall with theirs ; and that every blow
</p>
<p>we strike for thein is a blow for our own security.
</p>
<p>That is to say, we must " stand by our
</p>
<p>order ;" we dare not be selfish ; we cannot,
</p>
<p>without ruin to our own liberties, suffer those
</p>
<p>of the Southern people to be destroyed. When
</p>
<p>the founders of this Union inserted in the con-
</p>
<p>stitution a clause making it the duty of Congress
</p>
<p>to guaranty a republican form of government to
</p>
<p>every State, they wisely foresaw just this neces-
</p>
<p>sity. It is necessary to the welfare of the whole
</p>
<p>that each part shall be healthy ; it is necessary
</p>
<p>to the liberty of each that all shall be free.
</p>
<p>The aristocratic or despotic principle which is
</p>
<p>now fighting for a firm hold in a few States,
</p>
<p>would inevitably crush the liberty of all. Nor
</p>
<p>do the rebel leaders themselves fail to see this.
</p>
<p>They recognize the fact that the movement
</p>
<p>which they liave begun will not, if it succeeds,
</p>
<p>stop there ; they do not intend that it shall.
</p>
<p>They count, not on the separation of the Union

</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>COL. HAMILTON, THE LAST DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN
</p>
<p>FROM TEXAS.
</p>
<p>(From an article by Horace Greeley.)
</p>
<p>In all the discussions which during a full year pre-
</p>
<p>ceded and prepared for the PresidentVs Proclamation of
</p>
<p>Freedom, the opponents of Emancipation regarded tho
</p>
<p>alleged repugnance of Southern Uiiioni>t9 as their Mala-
</p>
<p>koffi "The Union has too few friends in the Soutti al-
</p>
<p>ready," they argued; "your policy will deprive it of
</p>
<p>these few. A^ide from the negroes, who are fettered
</p>
<p>and helpless, tlie Union will have no remaining well-
</p>
<p>wishers, in the South after you shall have identifled it
</p>
<p>wilh Abolition. IIow can we aiford thus to unite the
</p>
<p>Southern Whites in one compact, determined phalanx
</p>
<p>against us ? It is madness to urge it"
</p>
<p>The logic was forcible had the assumption whereon
</p>
<p>it was hased been a fact. But it was not and is not. as
</p>
<p>every day's developments tend more clearly to establish.
</p>
<p>The ice i-^ at lust broken, and the inundation of Liberal
</p>
<p>sentiment is already manifest.
</p>
<p>Hon. Andrew J. Hamilton, of Texas, is a striking
</p>
<p>illnstration of this truth. lie is a native of Alabama,
</p>
<p>reared a slaveholder, always surrounded by slaves, and
</p>
<p>always regarding Slavery with indolent and unquestion-
</p>
<p>ing approval. But for The Rebellion ho would probably
</p>
<p>have died a slaveholder and a reputed admirer of ' the
</p>
<p>peculiar Institution."
</p>
<p>But Mr. Hamilton, though a slaveholder, was never a
</p>
<p>disnnionist. When he saw those who worked very hard
</p>
<p>to bring Texas into the Union working even harder to
</p>
<p>get her out again, and.others with her, he stood up to re-
</p>
<p>sist them. In 1S59, the Democratic party of Texas, with
</p>

<p>nominated H. G. Runnels, formerly Governor of Misis-
</p>
<p>sippi, for governor of their State. Runnels was a dis-
</p>
<p>nnionist; his leading supporters were of the same stripe;
</p>
<p>the resolves and speeches of the Convention which nom-
</p>
<p>inated hill smacked of treasonable intent; in short, the
</p>
<p>nomination was calculated to te.'t the disposition of
</p>
<p>Texas as to the i-cheme of a Southern Confederacy. Gen.
</p>
<p>Sam Houston came out as " stump " candidate for Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor in opposition, and was elected by 8,670 majority 
</p>
<p>a result to which his prominent connection vrith the
</p>
<p>early history of Texas and his personal popularity doubt-
</p>
<p>less contributed. Mr. Hamilton in like manner ran for
</p>
<p>Congress in tiie Western District a.s an independent Union
</p>
<p>Democrat, and was elected over the regular Doinocratic
</p>
<p>candidate, Judge Waul, by 448 majority out of 82,870
</p>
<p>votes.
</p>
<p>Thus elected to Congress as a Unionist, Mr. Hamilton
</p>
<p>did not, like John Bell, betray the cause that had honored
</p>
<p>him. When, in the early part of 1861, his colleague,
</p>
<p>John H. Eeagan, now a member of tlie Confederate (Jab-
</p>
<p>inet, rose t) declare his own adhesion and that of his
</p>
<p>State to the Confederacy, Mr. Hamilton listened till he
</p>
<p>had concluded, and then said :
</p>
<p>" I care not for myself. I made up my mind at the beginning of
</p>
<p>iJiifl trouble never to pauae in any exertiona because of the condition
</p>
<p>in which it would place me for the time being, ether here or at
</p>
<p>home. I have not allowed one single motive of selfishness, if I know
</p>
<p>,my own heart, ever to interfere with the exercise of what little judg-
</p>
<p>ment I have been able to bring to bear upon these great questions.
</p>
<p>I am solemnly impressed, however, Mr. Speaker, with the condition
</p>
<p>in which I actually find myself. In traveling hither from my home,
</p>
<p>more than two thousand miles distant from thia Capital, for the dis-
</p>
<p>charge of a public duty, my foot pressed no spot of foreign territory.
</p>
<p>My eye rested upon not one material object, during my journey, that
</p>
<p>was not a part and parcel of my country, as I fondly deemed it.

<p>He sa; 8 it is false to nsfribe the rebellion to the action of
</p>
<p>the Abolition party. He says, and s.ays truly, that no
</p>
<p>Soutl-ern leader ever yet admitted that slavery w.as not

<p>adequaely protected by theNali' nal Goverrment. We
</p>
<p>know that the Confederate Commissionfrs in Europe

<p>kave labored most nssicuously to convince foreign cabi-
</p>
<p>nets Vat the Northern St:,t. s were no more disposed to
</p>
<p>the abolition ipf slavery than the Southern. But neither,
</p>
<p>tays Mr. Hamilton, did the Democratic party (Mr. Bu-
</p>
<p>e.hana:i's Adiiiinistration) prodi'ce the war. The can.se
</p>
<p>wa* <leeper than all the causes as'^igned. It was the con-

<p>This is the basis of the rebelli. n, and this is the battle

<p>to gel rid of the  hared Tatikee.' It is not because the men who inaugurated it hated the people of the North it was

</p>
<p>Dear Sir  Knowing the profound interest with which you
</p>
<p>T7atch the diffusion of information concerning the real mo-
</p>
<p>tives influencing the Slaveholders' Conepiracy, I respectfully
</p>
<p>submit for your conjideration a proof-sheet of the outlines
</p>
<p>of the Hon. Lorenzo Sherwood's late speech in New Jersey,
</p>
<p>with the belief that an expression of your opinion concern-
</p>
<p>ing his statements and reasonings would still further com-
</p>
<p>mend thefai to the consideration of your loyal countrymen
</p>
<p>South and North, and to the friends of free government in
</p>
<p>other lands, who wish to know the true causes of the at-
</p>
<p>tempted destruction, not only of our National Government,
</p>
<p>but of democratic institutions, by the slave-aristocracy, at
</p>
<p>Ihe present crisis.
</p>
<p>As no one knows better than you do the opportunities of
</p>
<p>Mr. Sherwood for learning thoroughly and correctly appre-
</p>
<p>ciating all branches of information concerning these vital
</p>
<p>lucstions- opportunities aflbrded by his long Southern es-
</p>
<p>|>erience and hit intimate connection with public afifairs (in
</p>
<p>and out of the Legislature) of Texas ; and as I know the cor-
</p>
<p>diality with which you and Mr. Sherwood have co-operated
</p>
<p>in sustaining loyal sentiments in the South, and in endeav-
</p>
<p>oring to cause the true motives of the rebellion to be cor-
</p>
<p>rectly understood among your Northern fellow-countrymen,
</p>
<p>as set forth in the publications of the Democratic League'
</p>
<p>I am sure yon ^vill not consider Intrusive this request for

<p>bPEECH OF LOEENZO BflKHWe^O.
</p>
<p>SPEECH OF LOKENZO SHERWOOD,
</p>
<p>EX-MEMBER OF THE TEXAN LEGISLATCKE,
</p>
<p>RESPECTING THE SLAVEHOLDERS' CONSPIRACY AGAINST DEMOCRATIC
</p>
<p>PRINCIPLES, AS WELL AS AGAINST THE NATIONAL UNION.
</p>
<p>My Fbee Fellow-countrtmen :
</p>
<p>1 thus designate yo\i, in contradistinction to
</p>
<p>the masses in the ^outh, -who aro now under the
</p>
<p>sway of despotism, and who are no longei- free.
</p>
<p>Hard as this word is to speak, and painful as it
</p>
<p>is to contemplate, the declaration is true. Those
</p>
<p>who have heretofore sympathized with you in
</p>
<p>the belief that tliey had enduring free govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and who are attached to its principles, find
</p>
<p>themselves suddenly transferred to the degrada-
</p>
<p>tion of a most mercenary and relentless despot-
</p>
<p>ism. I come to you to-night to disclose and elu-
</p>
<p>cidate the full meaning of the conspiracy that
</p>
<p>has deprived them of their political rights ; to
</p>
<p>excite your generous sympathy in their behalf;
</p>
<p>and, if po.-sible, to increase your animated deter-
</p>
<p>mination to uphold that clause of the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion which guaranties to the people of every
</p>
<p>State " free republican government."
</p>
<p>If I arrogate to myself something of special
</p>
<p>information, and more than is common to most
</p>
<p>others, it is only for the reason that I have been
</p>
<p>placed more immediately in contact with those
</p>
<p>who have co-operated in this great Soxithern con-
</p>
<p>spjracy, fitlj' denominated " The Slaveholders'
</p>
<p>Rebellion." It is a conspiracy, not only against
</p>
<p>the national jurisdiction, but a most foul conspir-
</p>
<p>acy also against free government in the South. I
</p>
<p>is this phase of the question that 1 would discuss,
</p>
<p>for it is as patent to my mind that a new order of

<p>government, based on privilege of class, is intend-
</p>
<p>it authore or contributois do not enttrtain tii. ^
</p>
<p>sentiments. If you discover that ~ democratic
</p>
<p>principles are repudiated as vicious in theoi'y
</p>
<p>and vile in practice, you may know that such
</p>
<p>principles are objectionable. When yon hear
</p>
<p>the democratic masses reviled, and continuously
</p>
<p>reviled, in the standai'd political literature of .;
</p>
<p>class, you may know th.al tlio?e masses are coi,
</p>
<p>demned by that class as an objectionable politi-
</p>
<p>cal element. I had every reason to believe, and
</p>
<p>did Vjelieve before secession, that the object ''
</p>
<p>the slaveholders was to overthrow the den -
</p>
<p>cratic principle.
</p>
<p>When the rebellion actually took place, it re-
</p>
<p>vived in my mind many things, previously bji;.;-
</p>
<p>ken by slaveholders, that would otherwise have
</p>
<p>r-
</p>
<p>been forgotten. It was then that the mii
</p>
<p>repeated declarations I had heard IIu<m
</p>
<p>ries of years assumed a significant meii ' i
</p>
<p>dispelled all doubt. Later revelalitr; ^^_
</p>
<p>tended to confirnt the foregone couclusi. ;,'"'"4
</p>
<p>the intent of the slaveholders  that is.

</p>
<p>As an additional evidence of the j'  g^
</p>
<p>cede, as well as the motive, the real, secretflRo
</p>
<p>five for secession, I will read the letter olaftr,
</p>
<p>Garnett to Mr. Trescott, -written in 1851. tWK
</p>
<p>speaker here read the letter.) This lotteifTr'':
</p>
<p>a most important bearing and mo&t porlS
</p>
<p>ous meaning. It "was written in secret
</p>
<p>fidence. It was written by a leading trs
</p>
<p>to a leadinsc traitor. It was written jtistf
</p>
<p>ed to be established, as it is that the national ju

</p>
<p>can search every corner of the country. Its in-
</p>
<p>fallibility is less open to attack than the Pope's,
</p>
<p>because it is, itself, public opinion." The author
</p>
<p>assumes tliat "in England the ability in govern-
</p>
<p>ment has been preserved by a highly aristocratic
</p>
<p>Constitution, both social and political."
</p>
<p>It may not be unprofitable, in elucidation of
</p>
<p>this subject, to recite in addition a few declara-
</p>
<p>tions and postulates from the present philoso-
</p>
<p>phers of the South. I would take up those whose
</p>
<p>opinions have passed current, and are in con-
</p>
<p>formity with the designs of treason. Mi*. George
</p>
<p>Fitzhugh, of Va., has more than emulated South
</p>
<p>Carolina in the expression of his motives to get
</p>
<p>rid of the Union. In the February number of
</p>
<p>De Bow's Review, 1861, he assumes "that it is a
</p>
<p>great mistake to "uppose that abolition alone
</p>
<p>was the cause of dissension between the North
</p>
<p>and the South." He assumes "that the Cava-
</p>
<p>liers, .Jacobites, and Huguenots, who settled the
</p>
<p>South, naturally hate, contemn, and despise the
</p>
<p>Puritans who settled the North. The former are
</p>
<p>master races; the latter, a slave race, the de-
</p>
<p>scendants of Saxon serfs. The former ai-e Med-
</p>
<p>iter- nean races, descendants of the Romans;
</p>
<p>for '.'avaliers and Jacobites are of Norman de-
</p>
<p>80. , and the Normans jvere of Roman descent,
</p>
<p>a. o were the Huguenots. The Saxons and
</p>
<p>Anf'-'-is, the ancestors of the Yankees, came from
</p>
<p>the old and marshy regions of the north, where
</p>
<p>r is little more than an amphibious biped."
</p>
<p>H- assumes, further, "that the Union has served
</p>
<p>ifcs purposes; that at the North the progress and
</p>
<p>teiidency of opinion was to pure democracy;

</p>
<p>move the people farther from the direct ex-

<p>CODclude, that aristocracy is the only safeguard

<p>of liberty, and the only power watchful and

<p>repugnance of the authoi", and the school to
</p>
<p>which he belongs, to the democratic principle in

</p>
<p>In an Essay written by J. Quitman Moore of
</p>
<p>fississippi, and published in De Bow's Review,
</p>
<p>lu 1861, the author makes the following postu-
</p>
<p>ahe: "Those pestilent and pernicious dogmas,
</p>
<p>'he greatest good to the greatest number,' 'the
</p>
<p>ajority shall rule,' are, in their practical appli-
</p>
<p>cation, the fruitful source of disorders never to be
</p>
<p>quieted, revolutions the most radical and san-
</p>
<p>guinary, philosophies' the most false, and passions
</p>
<p>the most wild, destructive, and ungovernable."
</p>
<p>"In America," says this author, "by reason of
</p>
<p>the operations of causes wholly extraneous to
</p>
<p>considerations of government and society, the
</p>
<p>republican experiment has been favored and
</p>
<p>prolonged beyond recorded precedent; but, pain-
</p>
<p>tlil as the reflection must be to all such as sub-
</p>
<p>scribed to the Utopian philosophy, and have an
</p>
<p>abiding I'aith in the capacity of man forcontiuu-
</p>

<p>sons, either as meclianics, artists, or professional
</p>
<p>men, and, with economy, to lay iip small por-
</p>
<p>tions for his daughters. To eftect these objects,
</p>
<p>he must have a farming tenantry, with hired la-

</p>
<p>and his farailj', tenants, laborers, and dependents
</p>
<p>his servants. It would be an easy way of get-
</p>
<p>ting back to predial slavery, without incurring
</p>
<p>the odium of the name. Give us entails, and we
</p>
<p>promise you a mild and modified form of domes-

<p>tic slavery. We are no experimenting socialist;

<p>we propose nothing new, but only to return to

<p>the institutions ordained by God, and tested and

<p>approved by human experience."

<p>I might continue these recitals, indicating the
</p>
<p>intentions of those who inaugurated the rebel-

<p>lion ; but, I have not time to proceed with them
</p>
<p>further on this occasion. These secret motives
</p>
<p>to overthrow free government in the south, were
</p>
<p>as carefully concealed from the non-slavetiolding
</p>
<p>masses in the South as they were from the
</p>
<p>twenty millions in the North. Had they been
</p>
<p>promulgated as the basis of revolution, the con-

<p>strength alone. The traitors would have been

<p>been understood; but, the masses in the South
</p>
<p>had been as much deceived by false pretences
</p>
<p>and the hypocrisy of the leading traitors, as the
</p>
<p>freemen of the North. The twenty-seven mil-
</p>
<p>lions, North and South, have been alike deceived,
</p>
<p>and most of them are laboring under the same
</p>
<p>delusion to-day.
</p>
<p>It was indispensably necessary to the purpo-
</p>
<p>ses of the rebellion, that false pretences and false
</p>
<p>motives should be held out. When the rebels
</p>
<p>entered upon the plot of treason many years ago,
</p>
<p>political strategy waa the great weapon with,
</p>
<p>which to inaugurate it. They had no more scru-
</p>
<p>ple on the score of falsehood and deceit than mi-
</p>
<p>litary men have under the usages of war.
</p>
<p>Whilst they professed to love the Government
</p>
<p>and the Union, they were hypocritically jjlotting
</p>
<p>to overthrow it. They used every a^t to gain
</p>
<p>confidence with Northern men, whilst secretly
</p>
<p>intending to betray it. We have still many
</p>
<p>men in the North, as well as in the South, who
</p>
<p>are yet blinded as to the real motives of .the
</p>
<p>traitois, and I have sometimes thought that those
</p>
<p>most deluded were connected with the adminis-
</p>
<p>tration at Washington, and the generals who
</p>
<p>are commanding, not to say leading, our armies.
</p>
<p>The great mistake that has been made \)y the |
</p>
<p>administration, and the leading influences that |
</p>
<p>have controlled it. has grown out of the idea that |
</p>
<p>slaveholders as a class, could be conciliated 
</p>
<p>that some arrangement could be made whereby
</p>
<p>the South could be restored through their agen-
</p>
<p>cy. The continuation of that mistake, if persis-
</p>
<p>ted in, will lose the whole Union cause. The

<p>necessity, to overthrow democracy. The effort
</p>
<p>to do this is backed not only by supposed neces-
</p>
<p>sity, in order to preserve slavery unimpaired,
</p>
<p>but by the whole train of ambitious motives con-
</p>
<p>nected with the raising up of an organized and
</p>
<p>cemented aristocracy.
</p>
<p>WTien we contemplate Southerc. population,
</p>
<p>and separate it into clashes  to say nothing of
</p>
<p>the negro  we find seven millions non-slavehold-
</p>
<p>ing population, democratic in its sentiments, at-
</p>
<p>tached to free government, and in every essential
</p>
<p>a natural element of national strength in connec-
</p>
<p>tion with liberalized institutions. When we
</p>
<p>look at the Ivorth, we find twenty millions hav-
</p>
<p>ing the same natural motives. How is it, and
</p>
<p>why is it, that fifteen hundred thousand men,
</p>
<p>women, and children, connected in proprietor-
</p>
<p>ship in slavery, should have wiehled a power
</p>
<p>and influence that have set the twenty-seven
</p>
<p>millions at variance, destroyed concert of action,
</p>
<p>and brought our Government to the deplorable
</p>
<p>spectacle now witnessed ? Is it because, as slave-
</p>
<p>holders pretend, that "they are our natural
</p>
<p>masters"? or is it because the twenty-seven mil-
</p>
<p>lions have been deceived  are now engaged in
</p>
<p>deceiving each other^  and have been frittering
</p>
<p>away their strength and substance on the most
</p>
<p>fallacious of all delusions the belief that the
</p>
<p>agencies which inaugurated the rebellion can be
</p>
<p>turned into an agency to restore the Union? If
</p>
<p>this be the reliance, in my belief the Union is

<p>gone.
</p>
<p>It has been apparent to my mind, and, as I

<p>peal should be made to the democratic element
</p>
<p>of the South, which as yet has never been spoken
</p>
<p>to by the Cabinet or Congress at Washington.
</p>
<p>It is now getting to be known that the political
</p>
<p>rights and liberty of this population are conspired
</p>
<p>agaiust. It has long been known that the de-
</p>
<p>mocracy-haters of Europe were in alliance with
</p>
<p>the traitors of the South to assist in the prostra-
</p>
<p>tion of the democratic principle. Why should
</p>
<p>not the President of the United States proclaim
</p>
<p>to this d emocratic element of the South the intent
</p>
<p>of the traitors to disfranchise the masses, and to
</p>
<p>erect upon the ruins of their political i-ights an
</p>
<p>hereditary aristocracy ? Why should not the
</p>
<p>President say to this population, "The Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion as it is guarantees you free republican gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, and, by all the powers in me vested,
</p>
<p>you shall have it"? Why does he not say to
</p>
<p>the democracy of the South, "The Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion as it is interdicts the establishment of any
</p>
<p>order of nobility, and, by the powers in me
</p>
<p>vested, 1 declare that it shall not be established" ?
</p>
<p>Why does he not command the generals of the
</p>
<p>araiy to forego their deluded sympathy in the
</p>
<p>. cause of the traitors, and look to the interests of
</p>
<p>the Southern masses, whosj rights are invaded
</p>
<p>and trodden down ? This folly of attempting to
</p>
<p>conciliate in the wrong direction, and to fight
</p>
<p>in the wrong direction, has actually prostrated
</p>
<p>the public confidence in the administration, in
</p>
<p>the generalship of the armies, and in our finan-
</p>
<p>cial power of endurance. This policy must be
</p>
<p>altered, or the Union is gone ; and if the separa-
</p>
<p>tion is once consummated, the restoration will
</p>
<p>never transpire.

<p>that class of our citizens made partakers of po-

<p>The slaveholdtr of the South fears that the

<p>intoUeetual politicians, Thsive observed this jeal-

<p>ousy, this fear; and what has troubled the pro-

<p>slavery spirit most of all things, has been the

<p>contemplated probability of an affinity between
</p>
<p>the free labor lyTorth and South. When that

<p>from generation to generation; and a pretty bu-
</p>
<p>siness it is for less than one hundred thousand

<p>rebel slaveholders to set these toiling millions to

<p>don our white non-slaveholding brethren of the

<p>to forbear the bold dei'Jaration in favor of this

<p>population, and to pledge all the adhering ele-

<p>ments of the Government to protect it  to shel-

<p>ter it under the national ensign  yea, if need

<p>be, to so far humble and subordinate the pro-

<p>right direction to the masses of the Southern
</p>
<p>white population ?
</p>
<p>It would Vje, useless to say "this non-slave-
</p>
<p>holding population cannot be reached." It can
</p>
<p>be reached, and can be enlisted on the side of
</p>
<p>its own protection. Let Congress and all tbe

<p>goverDmental powers declare their solicitude for
</p>
<p>it, and determination to protect it; and let us of

<p>the North re-echo the sentiment, and hail it as a

<p>brotherhood in politicui destiny and })olitical

<p>right. Arms will remove the blockade to intel-

</p>
<p>in my humble opinion the better.
</p>
<p>In the midst of tribulation, under democratic
</p>
<p>government, every sensitive man of impulse per-
</p>
<p>suades himself into the belief that he is a compe-
</p>
<p>tent adviser. We shall have a thousand and one
</p>
<p>distractions as to the declared motives which
</p>
<p>exist for the prosecution of the war. They are
</p>
<p>already being put forth in different sections, and
</p>
<p>the Government at'Washington is as little un-
</p>
<p>derstood in its views of policy as in its unpub-
</p>
<p>lished military designs. I think it time, in order
</p>
<p>to avoid public distraction in the North, and to
</p>
<p>show to the world that there is such a thing as
</p>
<p>definite motive in Government policy, founded
</p>
<p>on some tangible principle, to make an authori-
</p>
<p>tative congressional declaration of some kind;
</p>
<p>and the more pointed it is, if founded on just
</p>
<p>principle, the better. I doubt whether you
</p>
<p>could find an abolitionistpwse who would strike
</p>
<p>the right point. I also doubt whether any politi-
</p>
<p>cian from the Gulf Stales, however strong in his
</p>
<p>Union sentiments, would dare venture upon any
</p>
<p>definite declaration that would be specific. You
</p>
<p>will excuse my suggestions; they are made under
</p>
<p>the belief that something efi'eetive must be done
</p>
<p>in connection with arms to raise up a Southern

<p>strength to our side. If we cannot do it, the

<p>Union is gone. I hope it may never be said of

<p>us, that we have lost our strength and the force

<p>of the Union cause through timidity.

</p>
<p>that the disposition to forego as long as possible

<p>any resort to force by the national Government
</p>
<p>has been an ill-devised humanity, that has re-
</p>

<p>gained by paltering to the influences that have in-

<p>augurated this treason against the common popu-
</p>
<p>lation and common interest of the countr}^ I can-
</p>
<p>not see it. Perhaps those better skilled in political

<p>philosophy may be able to do so. I fear, however,
</p>
<p>that those who have so long failed to appreciate

<p>the nature, strength, and motives of this rebellion
</p>
<p>will be slow  quite too slow  in the enunciation

<p>of views or principles in connection wiih the
