<p>The poignant grief and universal deeply seated
</p>
<p>sorrow of those who knew Abraham Lincoln best
</p>
<p>and loved him most  the native and adopted
</p>
<p>masses of our re-born republic  are not restricted
</p>
<p>to the millions who, by his wise policy and stern
</p>
<p>adherence to the right, may yet say to the down
</p>
<p>trodden of other lands. "Come as your brothers
</p>
<p>have come, our glorious Union is again intact,
</p>
<p>an asylum for the oppressed."
</p>
<p>The dire calamity that has enshrouded our
</p>
<p>land with the ebony mantle of darkness is not
</p>
<p>ours alone. It is world wide. The mighty na-
</p>
<p>tions of Europe stand aghast at the dreadful

<p>VI PREFACE.
</p>
<p>afflicted sister of Columbia. The Lion tames on
</p>
<p>beholding the agony of the bird of Jove. Gallia
</p>
<p>reverts to her Reign of Terror, and wonders
</p>
<p>whether rivers of blood will flow in America as
</p>
<p>in her days of Robespeirre. "Not so, Nephew of
</p>
<p>your Uncle." The mantle of Elijah has fallen
</p>
<p>upon Elisha ; Columbia has an abiding faith in
</p>
<p>her Johnson.
</p>
<p>Classic Italia drops her chisel at the unfin-
</p>
<p>ished statue; the pencil refuses its office at the
</p>
<p>canvas. Our Hosmer and Powers cease for awhile,
</p>
<p>and mentally ask "who shall bring forth from
</p>
<p>the marble the semblance of the noblest work of
</p>
<p>God  a Good Man?

</p>
<p>you may, for the martyred statesman, but de-
</p>
<p>spair not. Wait a little longer and all will be
</p>
<p>well for the cause of freedom. Dire calamities
</p>
<p>to nations bring forth heroic vindicators of the

<p>treason accursed, call to the helm of State that

</p>
<p>has honored no less than her people now, and
</p>
<p>will for all time, honor his memory.
</p>
<p>Thanks to her noble Emperor, Russia's Bear
</p>
<p>has ceased his growl over serfdom, and the im-
</p>
<p>mortal edict of our Lincoln unrivets the shackles
</p>
<p>of four millions of men now  hitherto slaves.
</p>
<p>Well may they chant their homely but joyous
</p>
<p>ditty. "JN'ow has the Kingdom come, in the year
</p>
<p>of Jubile3." Terrible as has been the ordeal
</p>
<p>through which the nation has passed, there re-
</p>
<p>mains tb3 proud boast that she faltered not in
</p>
<p>her firm determination to sustain her position as
</p>
<p>the Land of Freedom, the home of the opjDressed.
</p>
<p>Nay, more, her grandeur and power are now far
</p>
<p>greater than when the rebellious crew developed
</p>
<p>their hell-born schemes for which they now stand
</p>
<p>accursed of God and man.

<p>The rainbow of promise dissipates the cloud of
</p>
<p>doubt as to the perpetuity of the Republic and

<p>agonized audience of wailing widows and orphans.
</p>
<p>VIU PREFACE.
</p>
<p>The curtain will soon fall on the fifth. Vindica-
</p>
<p>ted justice, retribution and expiation of the atro-
</p>
<p>cious deeds of traitors upon the gallows will be
</p>
<p>the fitting denouement of that tragedy to which
</p>
<p>generations unborn will turn with mingled feel-
</p>
<p>ings of wonder and horror.
</p>
<p>Historians of futurity will be at fault as to
</p>
<p>upon whom of the two actors shall fall the ful-
</p>
<p>lest execration of all men  the bloodstained As-
</p>
<p>sassin of the tragedy, or the pusillanimous, un
</p>
<p>sexed buffoon of the farce just enacted.
</p>
<p>Such as the above were our first thoughts. To
</p>
<p>speak or write calmly now is a heavy task. The
</p>
<p>pulpit andthe rostrum have called forth the talent
</p>
<p>of the nation, but the theme is too great. Our
</p>
<p>Clay, Webster and Everett are no more.
</p>
<p>We close our brief preface with a few remarks
</p>
<p>suggested in our calmer moments.
</p>
<p>Among the declarations of John Felton, , who
</p>
<p>assassinated the Duke of Buckingham, circum-
</p>
<p>stances gave prominence to this : " There is no

</p>
<p>alliance nearer to any one than his country."
</p>
<p>PREFACE. ii
</p>
<p>Every assassin of public men, and every rebel
</p>
<p>against the laws of his country, has probably
</p>
<p>persuaded himself that he was actuated by noble
</p>
<p>motives, and therefore anxious to blazon his spu-
</p>
<p>rious patriotism on the historic page. Under our
</p>
<p>institutions, true patriotism recognizes "the coun-
</p>
<p>try " in its faithful and trustworthy representa-
</p>
<p>tive, and the good President of the United States
</p>
<p>always becomes the object of unbounded endear-
</p>
<p>ment to the American people, with small regard
</p>
<p>to ordinary political bias on the part of any.
</p>
<p>When a man has carried our loved country
</p>
<p>through its sorest trials and greatest afflictions,
</p>
<p>he should find his reward in the country's deep-
</p>
<p>est love; and if a deeper love exists than that
</p>
<p>with which loyal men to-day cherish the memory
</p>
<p>of the martyr President, its manifestations are
</p>
<p>unknown.
</p>
<p>Abkaham Lincoln was justly called the good
</p>
<p>President. From the first, he dared to do right,
</p>
<p>even contrary to great prejudice on the part of
</p>
<p>superficial judges ; and his acts, during the stormy

<p>term of his administration, have formed for him
</p>
<p>PREFACE.
</p>
<p>a prouder monument than his bereaved people
</p>
<p>can ever dedicate to his name. Blocks of gran-
</p>
<p>ite and marble shafts are not needed to per-
</p>
<p>petuate the memory of the Christian statesman
</p>
<p>and martyred patriot in the hearts of freemen
</p>
<p>everj'^wheref on Grod's footstool ; and through the
</p>
<p>record of his acts shall he evermore declare to
</p>
<p>the world; "I still live."
</p>
<p>" Charity for all, malice toward none," was a
</p>
<p>declaration of his heart. The principle had marked
</p>
<p>his life, give emphasis to his acts, and imbued
</p>
<p>all his politics. That such a man could have a
</p>
<p>personal enemy is incomprehensible, and seems
</p>
<p>totally absurd, until explained as an offshoot of
</p>
<p>the secession malady that crazed the brains of
</p>
<p>his murderers, and fitted them, through its in-
</p>
<p>quisitorial tuition, for the blackest crime ; and,
</p>
<p>however matters may be patched, explained, apol-
</p>
<p>ogized for or generally befogged, the common sense
</p>
<p>of the people will force them to view this dam-
</p>
<p>ning act only as the grand culmination of the
</p>
<p>teachings of secession.

<p>people have weighed it deliberately, and are

<p>calmly waiting for results that 'shall complete its

<p>and feel that the crime can- be measured by no

<p>ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>SKETCH OF HIS LIFE.
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln was born in that part of Hardin county,
</p>
<p>Kentucky, which has since been called Larue. His remote
</p>
<p>ancestors were from Berks county, Pennsylvania. They re-
</p>
<p>moved to Eockingham county, Virginia, where Abraham the
</p>
<p>grandfather and Thomas the father of Mr. Lincoln were born.
</p>
<p>In 1780, Abraham Lincoln settled in Kentucky, which was at
</p>
<p>that time a wilderness filled with savages. His rude cabin was
</p>
<p>distant two or three miles from the nearest white settler. Life
</p>
<p>in this part of Kentucky was then in constant danger. The
</p>
<p>settler carried his gun and axe to the place of his daily labor, the
</p>
<p>one being as necessary to his protection as the other for the
</p>
<p>purposes of work. At night when the family retired to rest.
</p>
<p>the gun was always placed within convenient access.
</p>
<p>For four years, Abraham Lincoln managed to escape, while
</p>
<p>whole families in the immediate vicinity were murdered by the
</p>
<p>Indians. At the end of that period, while engaged one day in
</p>

<p>necessities of life. Compelled by poverty to separate, all the
</p>
<p>children but Thomas left the county, the second son re-
</p>
<p>moving to Indiana, the rest to other parts of Kentucky.
</p>
<p>Thomas at the age of twelve also left home, but soon returned
</p>
<p>to Kentucky, and in the year 1806 married Miss Nancy Hanks,
</p>
<p>who was a native of Virginia, so that all of the immediate ances-
</p>
<p>tors of the President were born on Southern soil. Mrs. Lincoln
</p>
<p>could read but not write, while her husband could do neither,
</p>
<p>except to scribble his name in a style which only some of his most
</p>
<p>intimate friends could decipher. Eegretting his own want of
</p>
<p>culture, he fully appreciated the advantages of education, and
</p>
<p>honored the superior learning of others. He was noted for kind-
</p>
<p>nessof heart and great industry and perseverance. Mrs. Lincoln,
</p>
<p>although possessed of no education, was blessed with much
</p>
<p>natural talent, excellent judgment and good sense. These quali-
</p>
<p>fications, together with her great piety, made her a suitable
</p>
<p>partner for a man of Thomas Lincoln's attributes. She was a
</p>
<p>mother whose example and teaching could not fail to be of vast
</p>
<p>benefit in the formation of the characters of her children. This
</p>
<p>estimable couple had three children  a daughter, a son who died
</p>
<p>in infancy, and Abraham who was born on the 12th of February,
</p>
<p>1809. The sister attained the years of womanhood and married,
</p>
<p>but died without issue.
</p>
<p>Although Southern by birth and residence, Mr. Lincoln
</p>
<p>early became imbued with a disgust for slavery. In witnessing
</p>
<p>the evils of the " peculiar institution," he longed for freedom
</p>
<p>from the disagreeable effects of a condition of society which made
</p>
<p>a poor white man even more degraded than the negro. Enter-
</p>
<p>taining these sentiments he naturally desired to change his place
</p>
<p>of residence. Early in October, 1816, finding a purchaser for

</p>
<p>his farm, he made arrangements for the transfer of the property
</p>
<p>OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 2S
</p>
<p>and for his removal. Ten barrels of whisky of forty gallons each
</p>
<p>formed the consideration for the sale of the farm, and although
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln was a temperate man, he acceded to the terms,
</p>
<p>because such transactions were common and regarded as proper.
</p>
<p>The value of the whisky was two hundred and eighty dollars
</p>
<p>and twenty cents in money.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln, with the slight assistance little Abe could give
</p>
<p>him, prepared a flat-boat and was soon floating down the Roll-
</p>
<p>ing Fork river with his household goods, tools and the barrels of
</p>
<p>whisky on his way to Indiana. After he had left the JRolling
</p>
<p>Fork and reached the Ohio, his boat was upset and all on it
</p>
<p>thrown into the river. With the assistance of some men on the
</p>
<p>bank, he saved the boat and a few tools, axes and three barrels
</p>
<p>of whisky. Starting once more, and proceeding to a well
</p>
<p>known ferry on the river, he was guided into the interior by a
</p>
<p>resident of the section of country in which he had landed, to
</p>
<p>whom he gave his boat in payment for his services. He trtiveled
</p>
<p>for several days with much difficulty, most of the time being em-
</p>
<p>ployed in cutting a road through the forest wide enough for a
</p>
<p>team, and at the end of eighteen miles, Spencer county, Indiana,
</p>
<p>was reached. The site of the new home being determined upon
</p>
<p>Mr, Lincoln returned to Kentucky on foot, and made prepara-
</p>
<p>tions to remove his family. In a few days the party bade fare-
</p>
<p>well to their old home, Mrs. Lincoln and her daughter riding
</p>
<p>one horse, the father another and Abe a third. After seven
</p>
<p>days' journey through an uninhabited country, their resting place
</p>
<p>at night being a blanket, spread upon the ground, they arrived
</p>
<p>at the spot selected for their residence, and no unnecessary delays
</p>
<p>were permitted to interfere with the immediate and successful
</p>
<p>clearing of a site for a cabin. An axe was placed in Abe's hands,

</p>
<p>and, with a neighbor's assistance, in two days Mr. Lincoln had a
</p>
<p>24 LIFE AND MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>house of about eighteen feet square. It had only one room, but
</p>
<p>some slabs laid across logs overhead gave additional accommo-
</p>
<p>dations, which were reached by climbing a rough ladder in one
</p>
<p>corner. A bed, a table and four stools were then made by the
</p>
<p>two settlers, fiither and son, and the building was ready for oc-
</p>
<p>cupancy. The loft was Abe's bed room, and there, night after
</p>
<p>night for many years, he who but recently occupied the most
</p>
<p>exalted position in the gift of the American people, and who
</p>
<p>dwelt in the White House at Washington, surrounded by all the
</p>
<p>comforts that wealth and power could give, slumbered with a
</p>
<p>coarse blanket for his mattress and another for his coverings
</p>
<p>Abe did not, through the long winter, neglect his reading and
</p>
<p>spelling. Before leaving Kentucky he had attended school,
</p>
<p>though for a short time only. He also practiced with the rifle,
</p>
<p>and became a shot of some note, much to the delight of his pa-
</p>
<p>rents.
</p>
<p>About a year after the fjimily removed to Indiana, Mrs.
</p>
<p>Lincoln died. Abe felt the loss keenly. He had been a dutiful
</p>
<p>son, and she the most devoted of mothers. A young man, soon
</p>
<p>after Mrs. Lincoln's death, offered to teach Abe writing. The
</p>
<p>opportunity was fraught with too much benefit to be rejected, and
</p>
<p>after a few weeks practice, under eye of his instructor and also
</p>
<p>out of doors with a piece of chalk or charred stick, he was able
</p>
<p>to write his name, and in less than twelve months could write a
</p>
<p>letter.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln married during the next year, Mrs. Sally Johnston
</p>
<p>of Elizabethtown, Kentucky, a widow lady with three children.
</p>
<p>Between this lady and Abe a strong attachment sprung up. She
</p>
<p>was every way calculated to supply the place made vacant by
</p>
<p>the death of Mrs. Lincoln. At the time of Mr. Lincoln's second

<p>marriage, a person named Crawford moved into the neighbor-

<p>n
</p>
<p>hood and opened a school to which Abe was sent. At this school
</p>
<p>he improved very much in reading and writing, and mastered
</p>
<p>arithmetic. " His school-garb comprised a suit of dressed buck-
</p>
<p>skin and a cap made from a raccoon skin." He took an unusual
</p>
<p>pride in his studies, and close application and a retentive memory
</p>
<p>made him a favorite scholar with this teacher. He was employed
</p>
<p>by the most ignorant settlers as their scribe whenever they had
</p>
<p>letters to write. A brief period at this school, and, to use a com-
</p>
<p>mon phrase, his education was finished. Six months of instruc-
</p>
<p>tion within the walls of an insignificant schoolhouse is all the
</p>
<p>education that Abraham Lincoln has received during a long life-
</p>
<p>time.
</p>
<p>For four or five years after leaving school, or until he was
</p>
<p>eighteen, he constantly labored in the woods with his axe, cutting
</p>
<p>down trees and splitting rails, and during the evening, read such
</p>
<p>works as he could obtain among the settlers. A year after, he was
</p>
<p>hired, by a man living near, at ten dollars a month, to go to New
</p>
<p>Orleans on a flat-boat, loaded with stores, which were destined
</p>
<p>for sale at the plantations on the Mississippi river, near the Cre-
</p>
<p>scent city, and with but one companion, started on this rather
</p>
<p>dangerous journey. At night they tied up alongside of the bank
</p>
<p>and rested upon the hard deck, with a blanket for a covering,
</p>
<p>and during the hours of light whether their lonely trip was
</p>
<p>cheered by a bright sun, or made disagreeable in the extremely
</p>
<p>violent storms, their craft floated down the stream, its helmsmen
</p>
<p>never for a moment losing their spirits, or regretting their accep-
</p>
<p>tance of the positions they occupied. Nothing occurred to mar
</p>
<p>the success of the trip, nor the excitement naturally incident to
</p>

<p>midnight attack by a party of negroes, who, after a severe con-
</p>
<p>26 LIFEAND MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>flict, were whipped by Abe and his comrade, and compelled to
</p>
<p>flee. After selling their goods at a handsome profit, the young
</p>
<p>merchants returned to Indiana.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln removed to Illinois in 1830, carrying their house-'
</p>
<p>hold articles thither in large wagons drawn by oxen, Abe being
</p>
<p>the driver of one team. In two weeks they reached Decatur,
</p>
<p>Macon County, Illinois, near the center of the State, and in
</p>
<p>another day, were on a tract of land of ten aci'cs, on the north
</p>
<p>side of the Sangamon river, about ten miles west of Decatur.
</p>
<p>Immediately after their arrival, a log cabin was erected, and
</p>
<p>Abe commenced to split the rails for the fence, with which the
</p>
<p>place was to be enclosed. As a rail splitter, a tiller of the soil,
</p>
<p>or a huntsman, to whose great accuracy of aim the family depen-
</p>
<p>ded in a great measure, for their daily food, young Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln was active, earnest and laborious, and when in the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing spring, he made known his intention to leave his home,
</p>
<p>to seek his fortune among strangers, the tidings were received
</p>
<p>by his parents and friends with the most profound sorrow. Pack-
</p>
<p>ing up his clothing, he started westward, and engaged to work on
</p>
<p>a farm in Menard county. Here he remained during the sum-
</p>
<p>mer and winter, at the same time improving himself in reading,
</p>
<p>writing, grammar and arithmetic. Early in the following spring
</p>
<p>he was hired bj'^ a man named Offutt, to assist in taking a flat-
</p>
<p>boat to New Orleans, and as it was found impossible to purchase
</p>
<p>a suitable boat, Abe lent a willing and industrious hand in build-
</p>
<p>ing one at Sagamon, from whence, when completed, it was float-
</p>
<p>ed into the Mississippi river. The trip was made, and his
</p>
<p>employer was so much gratified with the industry and tact of
</p>
<p>his hired hand, that he engaged him to take charge of his mill

</p>
<p>Abe as he was now called, won the respect an(t confidence of all
</p>
<p>with whom he had business dealings, while socially, he was much
</p>
<p>beloved by the residents, young and old, of the place.
</p>
<p>The Black Hawk war broke out in the early part of the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing 3'ear, and the governor of Illinois calling for troops, Abe
</p>
<p>offered his services. He placed his name first on the roll at the
</p>
<p>recruiting station in New Salem, and by his influence induced
</p>
<p>many of his friends and companions to do likewise. A company
</p>
<p>was soon formed, and Abe was unanimously elected captain.
</p>
<p>The company marched to Bardstown, and from there to the seat
</p>
<p>of war; but during their term of enlistment  thirty days  were
</p>
<p>not called into active service. A new levy was then called for
</p>
<p>and he enlisted as a private, and at the end of thirty days re-
</p>
<p>enlisted, and remained with his regiment until the end of the war.
</p>
<p>Soon after his return from this campaign, he was waited upon
</p>
<p>by several of the influential citizens of New Salem, who asked him
</p>
<p>his consent to nominate him for the Legislature. He had been
</p>
<p>a resident of the county only nine months but as a thorough-
</p>
<p>going " Henry Clay man" was needed, he was deemed the most
</p>
<p>suitable person to run. There were eight aspirants for the legis-
</p>
<p>tive position, but although he received tivo hundred and seventy-
</p>
<p>seven votes out of txoo hundred and eighty -four cast in New Salem
</p>
<p>he was not elected, the successful candidate leading by a few
</p>
<p>votes, having received a heavy vote in the country.
</p>
<p>He engaged in the mercantile business soon after his defeat,
</p>
<p>but in a few months sold out, and under the tuition of John Cal-
</p>
<p>houn  in later years connected with the Lecompton Convention
</p>
<p> became proficient in surveying, an occupation which for more
</p>
<p>than a year he found very remunerative for a novice. He was

</p>
<p>In August, 1834, he was elected to the Legislature, and in
</p>
<p>1836, 1838 and 18-10 was re-elected. He determined to become a
</p>
<p>lawyer while attending the first session of the Legislature to
</p>
<p>which he was elected, and being placed in possession of the
</p>
<p>necessary books, through the kindness of Hon. John T. Stuart,
</p>
<p>applied himself to study, and in 1836 was admitted to practice at
</p>
<p>the bar. He became a partner of Mr. Stuart at Springfield in
</p>
<p>1837.
</p>
<p>In March, 1837, a protest was presented to the House of Rep-
</p>
<p>resentatives of Illinois, and signed by Daniel Stone and Abraham.
</p>
<p>Lincoln, Representatives from Sangamon county. This is the
</p>
<p>first record that we have of the sentiments of Mr. Lincoln on
</p>
<p>the slavery question. It was in opposition to a series of resolu-
</p>
<p>tions which had been adopted, taking an extreme Southern view
</p>
<p>of slavery, for which Mr. Lincoln refused to vote, and subse-
</p>
<p>quently handed in the protest.
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln was a Whig candidate for Presidential elector in
</p>
<p>every campaign from 1836 to 1852, and in 1844 he stumped the
</p>
<p>entire State of Illinois for Henry Clay, and going into Indiana
</p>
<p>spoke daily to large gatherings, until the day of the election.
</p>
<p>His style of speaking was pleasing to the masses of the people,
</p>
<p>and his earnest appeals were not only well received, but were
</p>
<p>productive of much benefit to his favorite candidate. He was ac-
</p>
<p>customed, from early childhood, to the habits and peculiarities of
</p>
<p>all kinds of people, and he knew exactly what particular style
</p>
<p>of language best suited his hearers, and the result was that he
</p>
<p>was always listened to with a degree of attention and interest
</p>
<p>which few political speakers received.

</p>
<p>ever given in that district for a candidate opposed to the Demo-
</p>
<p>cratic party. Illinois elected seven representatives that year
</p>
<p>and all were Democrats but Mr. Lincoln. In the Whig con-
</p>
<p>vention of 1848, he was an active delegate, and earnestly ad-
</p>
<p>vocated the selection of General Taylor as the nominee for
</p>
<p>the Presidency.
</p>
<p>He was a candidate before the Legislature of Illinois for U.
</p>
<p>S. Senator, but his political opponents were in the majority, and
</p>
<p>General Shields was chosen. From that time till 1854, he con-
</p>
<p>fined himself to his profession. In the latter year he again en-
</p>
<p>tered the political field and battled indefatigably in the celebra-
</p>
<p>ted campaign which resulted in victory for the first time to the
</p>
<p>opposition of the Democratic party in Illinois. During the can-
</p>
<p>vass Mr. Lincoln was frequently brought into controversy upon
</p>
<p>the stand with Stephen A. Douglas. One of the discussions
</p>
<p>that was held on the fourth of October, 1854, during the pro-
</p>
<p>gress of the Annual State Fair, being remarkable as the great
</p>
<p>discussion of the campaign.
</p>
<p>On the second of June, 1858, the Republican State Conven-
</p>
<p>tion met at Springfield, and nominated Mr. Lincoln as their
</p>
<p>candidate for the United States Senate. The contest which
</p>
<p>followed was one of the most exciting and remarkable ever
</p>
<p>witnessed in this country. Mr. Douglas his opponent, had
</p>
<p>few superiors as a political debater, and while he had made
</p>
<p>many enemies, by his course upon the Nebraska bill, his per-
</p>
<p>sonal popularity had been greatly incronscd by his indepen-
</p>
<p>dence, and by the opposition manifested to him by the Ad-
</p>
<p>ministration.
</p>
<p>During the campaign Mr. Lincoln spoke thus of the Declara-

<p>' We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are born
</p>
<p>equal ; that they are endowed by their Creator with inalienable
</p>
<p>rights ; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of
</p>
<p>happiness.' This was their majestic interpretation of the econ-
</p>
<p>omy oT the universe. This was their lofty, wise and noble un-
</p>
<p>derstanding of the justice of the Creator to His creatures. Yes,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, to all His creatures, to the whole great family of
</p>
<p>man. In their enlightened belief, nothing stamped with the
</p>
<p>Divine image and likeness, was sent into the world to be trod-
</p>
<p>den on and degraded and imbruted by its fellows. They grasp-
</p>
<p>ed not only the race of men then living, but they reached for-
</p>
<p>ward and seized upon the furthest posterity. They created a
</p>
<p>beacon to guide their children, and their children's children,
</p>
<p>and the countless myriads who should inhabit the earth in other
</p>
<p>ages. Wise statesmen as they were, they knew the tendency of
</p>
<p>prosperity to breed tyrants, and so they established these great
</p>
<p>self-evident truths that when in the distant future some man,
</p>
<p>some faction, some interest, should set up the doctrine that none
</p>
<p>but rich men, or none but white men, or none but Anglo-Saxon
</p>
<p>white men, were entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of hap-

<p>piness their posterity might look up again to the Declaration

</p>
<p>their fathers began, so that truth and justice and mercy,
</p>
<p>and all the humane and christian virtues, might not be
</p>
<p>extinguished from the land, so that no man would, here-

<p>after, dare to limit and circumscribe the great principles

</p>
<p>which would take away from its grandeur, and mutilate the

<p>clined to believe that all men are not created equal iu
</p>
<p>those inalienable rights enumerated by our chart of liberty,
</p>
<p>let me entreat you to come back, return to the fountain

<p>whose waters spring close by the blood of the Kevolution.

<p>Think nothing of me, take no thought for the political

<p>but heed these sacred principles. You may not only de-

<p>me to death. While pretending no indifference to earthly

<p>The election day at length arrived, and although the efforts of
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln resulted in an immense increase of Eepublican votes,
</p>
<p>whatever aspirations he had for personal success were frustra-
</p>
<p>ted. A vote of 126,08-4 was cast for the Eepublican candidates,
</p>
<p>121,940 for the Douglas Democrats and 5,091 for the Lecompton
</p>
<p>candidates, but Mr. Douglas was elected United States Senator

<p>by the Legislature, in which his supporters had a majority of

<p>INCEPTION OF THE PLOT
</p>
<p>A leading officer of the Buchanan Administration received, on
</p>
<p>the first of January, 1861, a letter from a friend, a gentleman of
</p>
<p>Southern sympathies living in Baltimore, in which among other
</p>
<p>things, it Avas stated that twelve thousand men were already en-
</p>
<p>rolled and organized in that city, bound by the most solemn
</p>
<p>oaths, to do the bidding of their leaders, whose purpose was to
</p>
<p>march them against Washington, capture it, and with such re-
</p>
<p>inforcements as they could get from the south, hold it, not only
</p>
<p>to' prevent the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln, but in order to make
</p>
<p>it the capital of the future Southern Republic. Still darker
</p>
<p>threats than this, the letter stated, were whispered about, being
</p>
<p>nothing less than the assassination of Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Ham-
</p>
<p>lin. At that time, it is well known, bets were freely made in
</p>
<p>the streets of Washington that Mr. Lincoln would never be in-
</p>
<p>augurated as President of the United States. These stories were
</p>
<p>shortly after denied, but subsequent events j)rove that they have
</p>
<p>some foundation.
</p>
<p>On the 11th of February, Mr. Lincoln left his home in Spring-
</p>
<p>field, Illinois, on his way to Washington. A large number of
</p>
<p>people assembled, to pay him a token of respect before his depar-
</p>
<p>ture. The moment was a solemn one. The reports of threat-
</p>
<p>ened assassination, forcible prevention of the inauguration, and
</p>
<p>the like, had reached his eai'S, as well as those of his townsmen.
</p>
<p>His speech was short but affecting. He said :

<p>" My friends : No one in my position can appreciate the sad-
</p>
<p>ness I feel al this parting. To this people I owe all that I am.
</p>
<p>Here I have lived more than a quarter of a century; here my
</p>
<p>children were born, and here one of them lies buried. I know
</p>
<p>not how I shall see you again. A duty devolves upon me
</p>
<p>which is greater, perhaps, than that which devolved upon any
</p>
<p>other man since the days of Washington. He never would have
</p>
<p>succeeded except for the aid of Divine Providence, upon which
</p>
<p>he at all times relied. I feel that I cannot succeed without the
</p>
<p>same Divine aid which sustained him, and on the same Almighty
</p>
<p>Being I place my reliance for supjiort ; and I hope you, my
</p>
<p>friends, will all pray that I may receive that Divine assistance
</p>
<p>without which I cannot succeed, but with which success is cer-
</p>
<p>tain. Again I bid you all an affectionate farewell."
</p>
<p>During this speech Mr. Lincoln betrayed much emotion, and
</p>
<p>hundreds in the crowd were affected to tears ; cries of " We will
</p>
<p>pray for you, " "be just and have no fear" were heard, and a
</p>
<p>feeling of deep solemnity settled over the whole assemblage.
</p>
<p>Leaving Springfield Mr. Lincoln proceeded by easy passages
</p>
<p>to Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Columbus, Pittsburgh, Cleveland,
</p>
<p>Buffalo, Albany and New York. At all these places he was
</p>
<p>warmly received. Having been welcomed to the city in the
</p>
<p>presence of the Common Council of New York, by Mayor Wood,
</p>
<p>he replied :
</p>
<p>"Mr. Mayor;  It is with feelings of deep gratitude that I
</p>
<p>make my acknowledgment for the reception which is given me
</p>
<p>in the great commercial city of New York. I cannot but remem-
</p>
<p>ber that this is done by people who do not by a majority agree
</p>
<p>with me in political sentiment. It is more grateful because in

<p>this I see that for the great principles of our Grovernment the

<p>culties that confront ns at this time, and of which your Honor
</p>
<p>*has thought fit to speak so becomingly and so justly, as I sup-
</p>
<p>pose, I can only say that I agree in the sentiments expressed by
</p>
<p>the Mayor.
</p>
<p>" In my devotion I hope I am behind no man in the Union.
</p>
<p>But as for the wisdom with which to conduct the affairs tending
</p>
<p>to the preservation of the Union, I fear that too great confidence
</p>
<p>may have been reposed in me. I am sure I bring a devoted heart
</p>
<p>to the work. There is nothing that could ever bring me to con-
</p>
<p>sent, willingly, to the destruction of this Union, under which,
</p>
<p>not only the great commercial city of New York but the whole
</p>
<p>country has acquired its greatness, unless it were to be for that
</p>
<p>thing for which the Union itself was made. I understand the
</p>
<p>ship to be made for the carrying of the cargo, and so long as the
</p>
<p>ship can be sailed with the cargo it should never be abandoned.
</p>
<p>This Union should never bo abandoned unless it fails, and the
</p>
<p>possibility of its preservation shall cease to exist, without throw-
</p>
<p>ing passengers and cargo overboard. So long, then, as it is
</p>
<p>possible that the prosperity and liberties of this people can be
</p>
<p>preserved in the Union it shall be my purpose at all times
</p>
<p>to preserve it. And now, Mr. Mayor, again thanking you
</p>
<p>for the reception which has been given me, allow me to
</p>
<p>draw to a close."
</p>
<p>During this day (February 20th) reports of the threatened
</p>
<p>assassination of the President were circulated in the streets.
</p>
<p>At Newark, N. J., a handbill was circulated, calling upon
</p>
<p>unemployed working-men to attend at the depot on Mr.
</p>
<p>Lincoln's arrival at that city, and " demonstrate their dif-
</p>
<p>ferences " with him.

<p>of persons volunteered for a cavalry escort. At Trenton
</p>
<p>a large additional police force was put on duty to preserve'
</p>
<p>order. No disturbance took place however. Mr. Lincoln
</p>
<p>arrived at Philadelphia on the evening of the 2l6t, and was
</p>
<p>enthusiastically received, as he had been at Newark, Rah way,
</p>
<p>New Brunswick, Princeton, Trenton, and other points along
</p>
<p>the route. Leaving Philadelphia on the morning of the
</p>
<p>22d, he reached Harrisburgh in the happiest manner by th
</p>
<p>authorities and people of the city. Here, for the first time,
</p>
<p>rumors began to avail of persons being colluded togetho
</p>
<p>for some evil purpose.
</p>
<p>The committee of arrangements at Harrisburg learninj
</p>
<p>on creditable authority, that in all probability an attemp''
</p>
<p>would be made on the President's life at Baltimore, de
</p>
<p>bated the question of the manner of his passage  whether h]
</p>
<p>should pass from depot to depot, or go by a route whicl
</p>
<p>avoided change of cars. Finally it was arranged to leavo
</p>
<p>Harrisburgh at 6 o'clock in the evening, arriving at Balti-
</p>
<p>more and Washington at hours different from those hereto-
</p>
<p>fore announced. Accordingly Mr. Lincoln left Harrisburgh
</p>
<p>at the time secretly determined upon. The plan of action
</p>
<p>which was successfully carried out was this. Speeches and
</p>
<p>receptions were to be kept up all the afternoon ; special
</p>
<p>trains were arranged, the telegraph silenced, and men were
</p>
<p>stationed to cut the wires if necessary ; and upon the arrival
</p>
<p>in Baltimore, Mr. Lincoln was to be conveyed through the
</p>
<p>city in a close carriage. The plan was laid before Mr. Lin-
</p>
<p>coln, and it is said he indignantly rejected it. Mrs. Lincoln
</p>
<p>begged of him to go, and Governor Curtin and other in-

</p>
<p>fluential men also entreated him to adojjt the plan. He was
</p>
<p>OF ABRAHAM LINOOLK. 3(
</p>
<p>assured that he would certainly be assassinated if ho fol-
</p>
<p>lowed the original jjrogramme ; and it is said that Mrs.
</p>
<p>Lincoln's tears, and the arguments of his friends finally
</p>
<p>persuaded him to adopt the proposed course. He proceeded
</p>
<p>to Baltimore by a special express train, passed through the
</p>
<p>city unobserved, and reached Wasbington at 6 o'clock on
</p>
<p>the morning ofthe 24th. The train containing Mrs. Lin-
</p>
<p>coln and the rest of the Presidental party left Ilarrisburgh
</p>
<p>at the time publicly announced. When it reached Balti-
</p>
<p>more a vast crowd had assembled to meet it ; but it had
</p>
<p>got abroad that Mr. Lincoln had already passed through
</p>
<p>the city, and the train was saluted with groans and hisses.
</p>
<p>No violence was offered, however.
</p>
<p>It is well here to state, in justice to the character of our
</p>
<p>murdered President, that the story published in the telegraphic
</p>
<p>dispatches of the New York Times, on the 24th of February,
</p>
<p>that Mr. Lincoln passed from Harrisburgh to "Washington at-
</p>
<p>tired in a " Scotch plaid cap and very long military cloak, so
</p>
<p>that he was entirely unrecognizable," was utterly false. It
</p>
<p>was made out of whole cloth by a sensation reporter whose
</p>
<p>recent familiarity with Presidential attributes is fresh in the
</p>
<p>minds of the public. Mr. Lincoln was very much opposed to
</p>
<p>any concealment, but his opinion was overborne by that of
</p>
<p>undoubted personal and political friends. When he did go,
</p>
<p>howdver, he made no change in hia costume, and no attempt
</p>
<p>at concealment.
</p>
<p>The features of the Baltimore plot have never been per-
</p>
<p>fectly made clear. Innumerable rumors prevailed at the time,
</p>
<p>Bom of them doubtless founded om fact, others simply absurd.

</p>
<p>On the evening of the 21st of February, 1861, Secretary (then
</p>
<p>38 LIFB AND UARTTRDOIC
</p>
<p>Senator) Seward received official intelligence from General
</p>
<p>Scott, that a most diabolical plot had been successfully ar-
</p>
<p>ranged on the part of a secret organization in Baltimore to
</p>
<p>assassinate the President-elect on his arrival at that city. Mr.
</p>
<p>Seward communicated this intelligence to a few private friends,
</p>
<p>and it was determined to despatch a message at once ^^
</p>
<p>Philadelphia to inform Mr. Lincoln of the fact. On being
</p>
<p>told of it, the intended victim replied that he had heard the
</p>
<p>same thing from other sources, giving the Baltimore chief of
</p>
<p>police as one authority. The plot was to throw the Presi-
</p>
<p>dential train off the track by a torpedo placed conveniently to
</p>
<p>some high embankment, or failing in this, to mob and as-
</p>
<p>sassinate Mr. Lincoln on his arrival in Baltimore, the con-
</p>
<p>spirators to surround the depot, armed with knife or pistol.
</p>
<p>Ten or fifteen men were said to have been prepared to com-
</p>
<p>plete the work, and it is reported that a vessel was lying in
</p>
<p>the harbor ready to convey the murderers to Mobile. The
</p>
<p>following account is taken from a souice every way worthy
</p>
<p>of credit.
</p>
<p>"Some of Mr. Lincoln's friends having heard that a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy existed to assassinate him on his way to Washing-
</p>
<p>ton, set on foot an investigation of the matter. For this
</p>
<p>purpose they employed a detective of great experience, who
</p>
<p>was engaged at Baltimore in the business some three weeks
</p>
<p>prior to Mr. Lincoln's expected arrival there, employing
</p>
<p>both men and women to assist him. Shortly after coming
</p>
<p>to Baltimore the detective discovered a combination of men
</p>
<p>banded together under a solemn oath to assassinate the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent-elect. The leader of the conspiracy was an Italian

<p>refugee, a barber, well-known in Baltimore, who assumed th
</p>
<p>OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 85
</p>
<p>name of Orsini as indicative of the part he was to perform.
</p>
<p>The assistants employed by the detective, who, like himself^
</p>
<p>were strangers in Baltimore city, by assuming to be Seces-
</p>
<p>sionists from Louisiana and other seceding States, gained the
</p>
<p>confidence of some of the conspirators, and were intrusted
</p>
<p>with their plans. It was arranged, in case Mr. Lincoln should
</p>
<p>pass safely over the railroad to Baltimore, that the conspira-
</p>
<p>tors should mingle with the crowd which might surround
</p>
<p>his carriage, and by pretending to be his friends, be en-
</p>
<p>abled to approach his pei'son, when, upon a signal from
</p>
<p>their leader, some of them would shoot at Mr. Lincoln
</p>
<p>with their pistols, and would throw into his carriage hand-
</p>
<p>grenades filled with detonating powder, similar to those
</p>
<p>used in the attempted assassination of the Emperor Louie
</p>
<p>Napoleon. It was intended that in the confhsion which
</p>
<p>should result from this attack, the assailants would escape
</p>
<p>to a vessel, which was waiting in the harbor to receive
</p>
<p>them, and be carried to Mobile, in the seceding State of
</p>
<p>Alabama.
</p>
<p>"Upon Mr. Lincoln's arrival in Philadelphia, upon Thur&-
</p>
<p>day, the 21st day of February, a detective visited Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia, and submitted to certain friends of the President-
</p>
<p>elect the information he had collected as to the conspira-
</p>
<p>tors and their plans. An interview was immediately ar-
</p>
<p>ranged between Mr. Lincoln and the detective. The in-
</p>
<p>terview took place in Mr. Lincoln's room, in the Continen
</p>
<p>tal Hotel, where he was staying during his visit to Phila'
</p>
<p>delphia.

</p>
<p>flag on Independence Hall the next morning  the morning
</p>
<p>of the anniversary of "Washington's Birthday  and that he
</p>
<p>had accepted the invitation of the Pennsylvania Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture to be publicly received by that body in the after-
</p>
<p>noon of the same day. ' Both of these engagements,' said
</p>
<p>he, with emphasis, ' I will keep, if it costs me my life.
</p>
<p>If, however, after I have concluded these engagements, you
</p>
<p>can take me in safety to Washington, I will place myself at
</p>
<p>your disposal, and authorize you to make such arrange-
</p>
<p>ments as you may deem proper for that purpose.'
</p>
<p>" On the next day in the morning Mr. Lincoln performed
</p>
<p>the ceremony of raising the American flag on Independence
</p>
<p>Hall in Philadeljphia according to his promise, and arrived at
</p>
<p>Harrisburg on the afternoon of the same day, when he was
</p>
<p>formally welcomed by the Pennsylvania Legislature. After
</p>
<p>the reception he retired to his hotel, the Jones' House, and
</p>
<p>withdrew with a few confidential friends to a private apart-
</p>
<p>mient. Here he remained until nearly six o'clock the next
</p>
<p>morning, when in company with Colonel Lamon, he quietly
</p>
<p>entered a carriage without observation, and was driven to
</p>
<p>the Pennsylvania Railroad, where a sj^ecial train for Phila-
</p>
<p>delphia was waiting for him. Simultaneously with his de-
</p>
<p>parture from Harrisburg the telegraph wires were cut, so
</p>
<p>that his departure, if it should become known, might not be
</p>
<p>communicated at a distance.
</p>
<p>" The special train arrived in Philadelphia at a quai-ter be-
</p>
<p>fore 11 o'clock at night. Here he was met by the detec-
</p>
<p>tir who had a carriage in readiness into which the party
</p>
<p>entered, and were driven to the depot of the Philadelphia

</p>
<p>"They did not reach the depot until a quarter past 11;
</p>
<p>but fortunately for them, the regular train, the hour of
</p>
<p>which for starting was 11, had been delayed. The party
</p>
<p>then took berths in the sleeping-car, and without change
</p>
<p>of cars passed directly through to Washington, where they
</p>
<p>arrived at the usual hour, 6^ o'clock on the morning of
</p>
<p>Saturday, the 23d. Mr. Lincoln wore no disguise whatever,
</p>
<p>but journeyed in an ordinary traveling-dress.
</p>
<p>"It is proper to state here that prior to Mr. Lincoln's
</p>
<p>arrival in Philadelphia, General Scott and Senator Seward in
</p>
<p>Washington had been apprised from independent sources that
</p>
<p>imminent danger threatened Mr. Lincoln in case he should
</p>
<p>publicly pass through Baltimore, and accordingly a special
</p>
<p>messenger, Mr. Frederick W. Seward, was dispatched to Phil-
</p>
<p>adelphia to urge Mr. Lincoln to come direct to Washington
</p>
<p>in a quiet manner. The messenger arrived in Philadelphia
</p>
<p>late on Thursday night, and had an interview with the Pres-
</p>
<p>ident-elect immediately subsequent to his interview with the
</p>
<p>detective. He was informed that Mr. Lincoln would arrive
</p>
<p>by the early train on Saturday morning, and, in accordance
</p>
<p>with this information, Mr. Washburne, ' member of Congress
</p>
<p>ftom Illinois, awaited the President-elect at the depot in Wash-
</p>
<p>ington, whence he was taken in his carriage to his quarters
</p>
<p>in Willard's Hotel, where Secretary Seward stood ready to
</p>
<p>receive him.
</p>
<p>" The detective traveled with Mr. Lincoln under the name
</p>
<p>of E. J. Allen, which name was registered with the President
</p>
<p>elect in the book at Willard's Hotel. Being a well-known
</p>
<p>individual, he was speedily recognized, and suspicion naturally
</p>
<p>arose that he had been instrumental in exposing the plot which

</p>
<p>that he should leave Washington two days after his arrival,
</p>
<p>although he had intended to remain and witness the ceremon-
</p>
<p>ies of inaugeration.
</p>
<p>" After the discovery of the plot, a strict watch was kept
</p>
<p>by the agents of detection over the movements of the con-
</p>
<p>spirators, and efficient measures were adopted to guard against
</p>
<p>any attack which they might meditate upon the President-
</p>
<p>elect until he was installed in office.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Lincoln's family left ilarrisburgh for Baltimore, on
</p>
<p>their way to Washington, in the special train intended for
</p>
<p>him ; and, as before starting, a message announcing Mr. Lin-
</p>
<p>coln's departure and arrival at Washington had been telegraphed
</p>
<p>to Baltimore over wires which had been repaired that morn-
</p>
<p>iag, the passage through Baltimore was safely effected.

</p>
<p>ing the flag on Independence Hall on Friday morning, that
</p>
<p>he would assert his principles on his inaugeration, although
</p>
<p>he were to be assassinated on the spot, had evident reference

<p>to the communication made to him by the detective on the

<p>night preceding.

<p>by the detective of their deliberations in secret conclave. The

</p>
<p>detective and his agents regularly contributed money to pay
</p>
<p>the expenses of the conspiracy."
</p>
<p>Threats were made after !Mr. Lincoln's first inaugeration.
</p>
<p>It is well known, that he reached Washington in safety, but
</p>
<p>the secession element vastly predominated at the Capital, and
</p>
<p>threats of violence to the President-elect and to Mr. Hamlin^
</p>
<p>and of the forcible suspension of the inaugeration, were neither
</p>
<p>few nor secret. The city was filled with rebels who pro-
</p>
<p>claimed their seentiments boldly in the streets, and hinted
</p>
<p>violence to the Executive. National airs were hissed dowa in
</p>
<p>public places of amusement, loyal men were assaulted on the
</p>
<p>avenue, and cheers for Jeff. Davis were of common oecurrenee.
</p>
<p>For some time previous to the inaugeration there had been
</p>
<p>threats of bloodshed on that occasion and the military author-
</p>
<p>ities taxed their brains for devices to prevent any such catas-
</p>
<p>trophe. Geneaal Scott made every preparation for fighting.
</p>
<p>The volunteer organizations in the procession were supplied
</p>
<p>with cartridges ; sharpshooters were posted at convenient spots
</p>
<p>along the avenue and on the roofs of buildings, and at the
</p>
<p>market house a small force of infantry was posted for the
</p>
<p>support of the riflemen in that vicinity.
</p>
<p>The batteries of Magruder and Fry were at the corner of
</p>
<p>Delaware Avenue and B street, ready for action ; the gunners
</p>
<p>and drivers remaining at ther posts throughout the ceremon-
</p>
<p>ies. General Scott in the meantime kept his scouts busiiy
</p>
<p>occupied visiting all parts ef the dense crowd, and watching
</p>
<p>for the first indications of trouble. The day passed off how-
</p>
<p>ever quietly. But the feverish anxiety of that morning, aad

<p>monstrations, created impressions on the minds of those who
</p>
<p>44 L I F E A X D 51 A R T Y K D JI
</p>
<p>were present, that will probably never be erased. The com-
</p>
<p>inandaat !Magruder of oue of those batteries referred to, left
</p>
<p>Washington a few days after and [subsequently was made a
</p>
<p>general by the rebels. Despite all the plans to the contrary
</p>
<p>the inaugeration happily passed off without the occurrence of
</p>
<p>any scenes of violence of a similar character, the fighting being
</p>
<p>confined to drunken partisans in the street.
</p>
<p>Since 1861, Mr. Lincoln has rarely, if ever, appeared in
</p>
<p>public without a sufficient escort, one company of cavalry
</p>
<p>being inevitable in attendance. Of late, however, it has been
</p>
<p>thought that precaution was not so absolutely necessary, and
</p>
<p>in the visit to the theatre at which it was destined he should
</p>
<p>be murdered, he was accompanied by no person save members
</p>
<p>of his own family and one officer of the army. However,
</p>
<p>great danger is known to be, after a time we became indiff-
</p>
<p>erent to it and neglect precautions that were at first deemed
</p>
<p>necessary. Not only was it all important that there should be
</p>
<p>a guard in constant attendance on the President, but so long
</p>
<p>as there, was the least reason for suspicion of plots to destroy
</p>
<p>him, every effort ought to have been made to ferret out the schem-
</p>
<p>ers and bring them to justice, that an example be made. Had
</p>
<p>desperadoes been made to feel that so sure as they were dis-
</p>
<p>covered in any such undertakings, punishment the most severe
</p>
<p>was to follow, few would design a conspiracy and none poss-
</p>
<p>ibly attempt to execute.
</p>
<p>The last inaugeration, however, did not pass off without a
</p>
<p>due i:)roportion of rumors ; and, amongst these was one that
</p>
<p>something was going on, indicating that trouble was anticipated
</p>
<p>from some undeveloped quarter. Rumor had it that all the

<p>roads leading to Washington had been heavily picketed for

</p>
<p>some days, and the bridges guarded with extra vigilance, as
</p>
<p>if on the watch for suspicious characters. Also, that the
</p>
<p>Eighth Illinois Cavalry had been pushed out from Fairfax
</p>
<p>Court House, on an active scouting expedition, as if in search
</p>
<p>of some of the same suspicious characters ; and further, that
</p>
<p>undue proportion of hard cases, in grizzled costume, were to
</p>
<p>be seen upon the streets, indicating something pertending.
</p>
<p>But as the day wore on in tranquillity, all fears wore dissi-
</p>
<p>pated. For the purpose of preserving order, the military pat-
</p>
<p>rols were doubled, and made more frequent rounds of the
</p>
<p>streets than usual. But notwithstanding the large number of
</p>
<p>strangers in the city, good order prevailed and but few arrests
</p>
<p>were made by the military or police authorities.
</p>
<p>On the 7th of March, in the present year, a man named
</p>
<p>Clemens was arrested in Washington, chargee with having
</p>
<p>contemplated the assassination of the President. The facts
</p>
<p>in the case are as follows :  Clemens and another person
</p>
<p>came from Alexandria on inaugeration day. They were both
</p>
<p>extremely disorderly, and seemed to have been drinking freely,
</p>
<p>Clemens, in particular, was very abusive. He said, using
</p>
<p>gross and profane language, that he came to Washington to
</p>
<p>kill the President; that he was late by about one-half hour,
</p>
<p>and that his Saviour would never forgive him for failing to
</p>
<p>do so ; that he would do it that night, namely, the 4th day
</p>
<p>of March ; and that he came expressly to do it, and he would
</p>
<p>do it before he left town. He furthermore said that tiie
</p>
<p>Government has robbed him of a certain sum of*ioney. This
</p>
<p>was the substance of an affidavit. Clemens was turned over
</p>
<p>from the military to the civil authorities, and was committed

<p>to jail for trial by the Court. Afterward he was released,
</p>
<p>46 LIFEAKDMARTTKDOM
</p>
<p>as having been completely under the influence of liquor at
</p>
<p>the time the alleged threats were made, that he did not
</p>
<p>know what he said. But would it be remarkable, in view of
</p>
<p>present circumstances, if this man Clemens should really have
</p>
<p>had, or have, some connection with the real assassin of the
</p>
<p>President in carrying out the dread ful plot. It will be seen
</p>
<p>from Washington despatches that letters found in the
</p>
<p>trunk of Booth, the murderer, show that the assassination
</p>
<p>was originally fixed for the 4th of March, but postponed
</p>
<p>for some reason not yet known. Clemens declared that he
</p>
<p>also intended to murder Mr. Lincoln on that day.

<p>8E0RET ORGANIZATIONS.
</p>
<p>Secret societies are of two kinds, those whose proceedings
</p>
<p>are unknown to all who do not belong to them ; and those
</p>
<p>whose existence as well as transactions is kept inviolate. Of
</p>
<p>the second kind are those which have their origin and being
</p>
<p>in Europe, mostly in Italy, where they ought to remain. The
</p>
<p>American soil is no place for them. Societies of this kind
</p>
<p>are destructive of liberty, and the only means of suppressing
</p>
<p>them when they are found to exist is to bring to bear such
</p>
<p>an opposition of public opinion, that respectable persons will
</p>
<p>have nothing to do with them. No good in a land of free-
</p>
<p>dom will come from organizations of this nature. What a
</p>
<p>man is unwilling to acknowledge openly, in reference to his
</p>
<p>political leanjjggs and convictions, will generally be found to be
</p>
<p>in, antagonism to the principles on which the government is
</p>
<p>based. Free discussion of all questions relating to the public

</p>
<p>necessary. We can never expect to advance in political science so
</p>
<p>long as tlie votes of enough to decide contests can be bought
</p>
<p>or controled by a few. If a number of persons in secret con-
</p>
<p>clave, oath bound, are allowed to sway the masses, that they
</p>
<p>may ride into power and retain it, popular government is
</p>
<p>but a name, a sound, and an aristocracy becomes in effect the
</p>
<p>government.
</p>
<p>The liberties of a people are not lost at once. The
</p>
<p>gi-adation is not rapid even. Slowly in most cases, but
</p>
<p>act the less surely the process goes on, and not till some
</p>
<p>violent measure is adopted by those who are thus seeking
</p>
<p>to deprive the peoj)le of their rights, do they wake up to
</p>
<p>a sense of their situation. And then it is found that what
</p>
<p>Jvas once nothing more than a simple assertion of right
</p>
<p>has become treason against a person, or set of persons, who
</p>
<p>were originally nothing more than the agents of the people.
</p>
<p>Extreme measures always beget extremes. Violence will
</p>
<p>be followed by violence, and there is no better way to
</p>
<p>bring about a despotism than by the commission of such
</p>
<p>deeds as those of the 14th of April. Stringent means will
</p>
<p>be adopted in such cases to capture the guilty ones, and
</p>
<p>many persons who are really innocent of all complicity
</p>
<p>in the affair will be suspected, and perhaps punished.
</p>
<p>The attention of every law-abiding citizen and well-wisher
</p>
<p>of his country must be drawn to the investigation going
</p>
<p>on. All are alike interested, and he who appears indiffer-
</p>
<p>ent is morally an abettor. Sneers at those who assert that
</p>
<p>secret bodies exist must not be heeded. There do exist
</p>
<p>treasonable combinationg whose purpose is, first, destruction
</p>
<p>of those in power, and finally subversion of republican in-

<p>" There can be no reasonable doubt that Lincoln and

<p>Seward have been assassinated. The crimes of these two
</p>
<p>men may make this event justifiable in the eyes of man
</p>
<p>and God, but wo do not concur with those who rejoice.
</p>
<p>Johnson has greater native ability, if this has not been
</p>
<p>impaired by his excesses, than any Northern statesman of
</p>
<p>his j)arty except Chase. The war will now assume a new
</p>
<p>phase. If confined to these States, then it is one of utter
</p>
<p>extermination. The veritable Eeigu of Terror has already
</p>
<p>begun in Tennessee. It is probable, if Booth be a Northern
</p>
<p>man, that the assassination of Lincoln is the work of those
</p>
<p>secret Western clubs whose mysteries have been developed in late
</p>
<p>judicial proceedings in Chicago and Ohio. If this he true, the

<p>war may begin in the North-west.

<p>are latterly known. Sons of Liberty; and convey informa-

<p>with loud cheers, and thereupon S. S. Cox, C. C. Burr,

<p>Koontz of Pennsylvania, Baker of Michigan, Stambaugh of

<p>Ohio, and several other delegates gave utterance to similar

<p>choice opinions,  each calling our President a usurper, and
</p>
<p>denouncing against him all the most outrageous crimes

<p>growth of a Northern party with Southern sympathies. It has

<p>existed in our midst duz'ing the past four years, but we hardly
</p>
<p>comprehend the fact ; and still less do the people know of
</p>
<p>the nature and unholy pui'poses of the organization. It is
</p>
<p>time these particulars are fully understood. Its oath;  and

<p>penalties, its sj)y system and police regulations, all its mm*-
</p>
<p>derous ingenuity and damnable crimes, should be made public,
</p>
<p>that we may know the enemy we have to contend against j

<p>and that the people may know what a mine has been planted
</p>
<p>beneath their homes, in many cases by their own neighbors,
</p>
<p>to blow them to destruction in a moment. The " exposition "
</p>
<p>of Edmund Wright, first published about a year since, was
</p>
<p>scarcely heeded, although widel}'' read. The Knights jeered

<p>at it, and called it incredible; but their object is now evident

<p>that if Wright was believed, their power was at an end.

<p>It is time now to heed every warning, and to break, per-

<p>this crime without let or hindrance, fully and to the last re-
</p>
<p>sort j and the guilty will suffer, whatever their numbers, or
</p>
<p>positions.
</p>
<p>It is shown that the programme of murder was arranged on
</p>
<p>an immense scale, and at least one hundred prominent person-
</p>
<p>ages were marked for sacrifice to the Moloch of Blood. There
</p>
<p>were one hundred armed assassins at Ford's Theatre on the
</p>
<p>night of the 14th of April, each ready to aim the deadly bul-
</p>
<p>let at the life of a victim; and only through that Providence
</p>
<p>that stayed the hand of him who had promised to turn off
</p>
<p>the gas and leave the place in darkness, was such an event
</p>
<p>averted I Other murderers were engaged in similar scenes of
</p>
<p>blood at other localities in Washington ; and will probably
</p>
<p>never be known how many hearts God struck with terror or
</p>
<p>remorse  how many failed through fear or lack of opportu-
</p>
<p>nity, that otherwise would have added their names to this
</p>
<p>black record. What, then, may reasonably be supposed as
</p>
<p>the extent of a conspiracy that employs so many agents to
</p>
<p>do its work ? Too large, by far, for the safety of freemen ;
</p>
<p>too powerful for evil to remain in power.
</p>
<p>When the tidings of the assassination were made public

<p>throughout the land, a few in each locality were inconsider-

</p>
<p>nation! Who were tliey? Of what class and antecedent?
</p>
<p>Many paid the penalty for their blasphemy with their lives,
</p>
<p>and few stopped to consider that the executioners were heed-
</p>
<p>ful of the old Mosaic law, that requires "a life for a life ;"
</p>
<p>but history, in other times, will so wake up the record I
</p>
<p>They were part of a murderous gang  part of the machinery
</p>
<p>that worked it into action, and equally guilty with those who
</p>
<p>executed the bloody work.
</p>
<p>In other localities, remote from telegraph stations, de-
</p>
<p>tailed reports of the great crime reached the jjeople too
</p>
<p>soon, and in forms greatly exaggerated, involving the death
</p>
<p>of President, Vice-President, and every member of the
</p>
<p>Cabinet. It is useless to assume that in such neighbor-
</p>
<p>hoods something of the matter was not foreknown,  but
</p>
<p>by whom ? Evidence is plentiful enough that the conspi-
</p>
<p>racy was extensive, and that its moving spirits were of the
</p>
<p>North and So-uth, in combination. The investigation and
</p>
<p>working up of the evidence is in charge of shrewd heads,
</p>
<p>who will do their work thoroughly. It is no longer a
</p>
<p>question whether the conspiracy will be traced to its real
</p>
<p>projectors and abettors, for the tangled skein is daily un-
</p>
<p>raveling ;  new developments transpire as rapidly as the
</p>
<p>scenes in a panorama ;  each discovery adds a fresh link
</p>
<p>to the chain of evidence that is gathering around the ac-
</p>
<p>cused, to hem them in beyond rescue ; and it is known
</p>
<p>that none of the guilty ones can escape.

<p>The lesson is dearly purchased, but should be heeded

<p>PLOT TO ASSASSINATE THE PRESIDENT.
</p>
<p>Whether Jefferson Davis and other rebel leaders con-
</p>
<p>trived, authorized, or openly approve the assassination of
</p>
<p>President Lincoln, is a question to which we can not give
</p>
<p>a direct answer. The evidence in the case is collateral,
</p>
<p>and illustrative rather than positive. When Preston S.
</p>
<p>Brooks, of South Carolina, assaulted and tried to murder
</p>
<p>Charles Sumner, we of the North said: The South will
</p>
<p>denounce that act as cowai-dly and infamous; but, on the
</p>
<p>conti-ary, the South by her newspapers and public men,
</p>
<p>without one exception, applauded it. Since that time, be-
</p>
<p>side making war on the republic, the South has evinced
</p>
<p>its fiendish hatred of the North by the atrocities commit-
</p>
<p>ted on our dead soldiers at Bull Run, by the massacres
</p>
<p>at Milliken's Bend and Fort Pillow, by the systematic cru-
</p>
<p>elties inflicted on our prisoners, by the Alabama outrages,
</p>
<p>by the St. Albans' and other piracies on the border, by
</p>
<p>the hotel bui-ning plots, and so far as threats went, there
</p>
<p>has been abundant evidence that assassination was deemed
</p>
<p>an equally legitimate and justifiable method of wai'fare.
</p>
<p>The advertisements and editorials, appearing repeated-
</p>
<p>ly unrebuked in Southern papers, proposing rewards for
</p>
<p>the murder or kidnapping of Mr. Lincoln, show that the
</p>
<p>rebel leaders did not object to such schemes though they

<p>may not or may have incited them. About a year ago, a
</p>
<p>correspondent of the New York Tribune, who had for some
</p>
<p>time been on duty inside the war office at Eichmond, and
</p>
<p>who afterwards escaped to "Washington, sent to that paper
</p>
<p>some vahiable and timely information. He wrote subse-
</p>
<p>quently from Canada, disclosing and thereby preventing
</p>
<p>more than one scheme for a murdex'ous foray across the
</p>
<p>border. He foretold the plot which culminated in New
</p>
<p>York, in the attempt to fire the hotels, and he revealed
</p>
<p>the particulars of a conspiracy to kidnap the President,
</p>
<p>which the following details will show to have been consid-
</p>
<p>ered aad approved by the rebel President, Secretary of State,
</p>
<p>and Secretary of War. We quote in full a passage from a
</p>
<p>letter published in the Tribune of March 19th, 1S64:
</p>
<p>"In a former communication I stated that a plan had
</p>
<p>been submitted to the rebel War Department by Mar-
</p>
<p>-grave, who had been for a considerable time an emissary
</p>
<p>in the North, to kidnap President Lincoln and carry him
</p>
<p>to Richmond, or if it should be found impossible to escape
</p>
<p>with him to the Rebel lines, to assassinate him. Owing
</p>
<p>to a change in the position of the armies about this time,
</p>
<p>the plan proposed was rendered imi)raticable.
</p>
<p>" In the early part of November, and only a few days
</p>
<p>before he was sent North, Margrave submitted another
</p>
<p>plan, the details of which may be interesting to the
</p>
<p>reader. To give the plan in minutiae would occupy too
</p>
<p>much space, but a digest of it will prove quite intelligible.
</p>
<p>" One hundred and fifty picked men were to go secretly
</p>
<p>North and take quarters in Washington, Georgetown, Bal-

</p>
<p>daily Tvith each other, and, upon a day fixed by their
</p>
<p>leader, were to assemble in Washington for the purpose of
</p>
<p>making the seizure. The President, it Avas claimed, could
</p>
<p>be -easily seized at a private hour at the White House, or
</p>
<p>in going to, or returning from church, or on some other
</p>
<p>. favorable occasion, and thrust into a carriage and driven
</p>
<p>off. The carriage was to be joined a few miles out of the
</p>
<p>city by twenty-five or thirty armed men on horseback. It
</p>
<p>was proposed to drive to Indian Point, about twenty-five
</p>
<p>miles south of Washington, on the Potomac  two or three
</p>
<p>relays of fleet horses being stationed on the way  where
</p>
<p>a boat was to bo in waiting to cross the river, and land
</p>
<p>the captive a few miles south of Occoquan, when it would
</p>
<p>be an easy matter for his captors to work their way with
</p>
<p>him through the woods by night into the Eebel lines. To
</p>
<p>prevent pux'suit, every bridge between Washington and In-
</p>
<p>dian Point was to be mined beforehand, and blown up as
</p>
<p>soon as the captive and his captors had crossed. Huge
</p>
<p>trees were also to be ready cut and thrown across the
</p>
<p>road in various places, as soon as they had passed, by
</p>
<p>men stationed along for the purpose, who were afterward
</p>
<p>to separate and escape as best they could.
</p>
<p>" The Secretary of War thought this scheme might succeed ;
</p>
<p>but he doubted whether such a proceeding would be of a
</p>
<p>military character and justifiable under the laws of war.
</p>
<p>He promised, however, to consult the President and Mr. Ben-
</p>
<p>jamin ; but what conclusion was arrived at I am unable with
</p>
<p>certainty to say. About a week, however, after the plan
</p>
<p>was submitted, and the same day that Margrave left for the

<p>North, I asked Mr. Wellford, who is familiar with all the
</p>
<p>58
</p>
<p>LIFE AND MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>secrets of the Department, if the plan had been adopted, and
</p>
<p>lie answered, "You will see Old Abe here in the spring as
</p>
<p>sure as God." A few days afterward I was sent to Atlanta,
</p>
<p>and never returned to Richmond to hear about the matter.
</p>
<p>" But this is not the only scheme by any means that has
</p>
<p>been devised for kidnapping our President. Last summer a
</p>
<p>club or society of wealthy citizens of Richmond was formed
</p>
<p>for the purpose of raising a fund for this object. Circulars
</p>
<p>were sent to trustworthy citizens in every other city and
</p>
<p>town in the Confederacy, inviting co-operation in the grand
</p>
<p>undertaking, and an immense sum of money was subscribed.
</p>
<p>The firm of Merry & Co., bankers in Richmond, subscribed
</p>
<p>10,000, and Sumner & Arents, auctioneers, subscribed 5,000;
</p>
<p>and I have heard on good authority that there were several
</p>
<p>in the capital who subscribed even more liberally than the
</p>
<p>parties named, but who they were, I did not learn. One
</p>
<p>man of Charleston, South Carolina, whose name I have for-
</p>
<p>gotten, subscribed $20,000. It was proposed, when all was
</p>
<p>ready, to obtain a furlough for Mosby, and make him lead-
</p>
<p>er of the enterprise.
</p>
<p>" Whether these schemes have been abandoned, or whether
</p>
<p>the kidnappers are only awaiting a favorable opportunity to
</p>
<p>execute them, remains to be seen ; but certain it is that too
</p>
<p>much caution cannot be observed by the President, or the
</p>
<p>military commanders stationid at the capital."
</p>
<p>As these statements were questioned by many journals
</p>
<p>in the North, the writer of the above subsequently for-
</p>
<p>warded to the same paper the following documentary evi-
</p>
<p>dence, being a letter from Calhoun Cullum, at that time a

</p>
<p>the South. The original letter was gent enveloped, post-
</p>
<p>marked and stamped with a Confederate ten cent postage
</p>
<p>stamp, and addressed to Mr. "Wellford, a clerk in the war
</p>
<p>office at Eichmond. Although it was published as long ago
</p>
<p>as April 23d, 1864, its genuineness has never been denied
</p>
<p>nor its statements contradicted :
</p>
<p>"MoROANTOWK, Sept. 30, 1803.
</p>
<p>"Mt Dkar Wellfoed : I have for several weeks been looking for a
</p>
<p>letter from you on the subject of our last conversation. On yesterday,
</p>
<p>Mr. Gaither, M. C. for the IXth District, came to see father and dined
</p>
<p>with us. He spent the week before last in Richmond, and had a num-
</p>
<p>ber of conversations with the President, Secretary of War, and other of-
</p>
<p>ficials. I inquired of him if he had heard anything of the ruse de
</p>
<p>guerre to capture "Honest Abe," and he said he had, but that the af-
</p>
<p>fair would probably be managed rather by individual enterprise than by
</p>
<p>the Government. He gave me the names of the most prominent workers in
</p>
<p>the project in Richmond, and as you must be acquainted with them all, I beg
</p>
<p>you to put in a timely word for me. If the affair was to be managed
</p>
<p>by the Government I knew your influence, and that of my other
</p>
<p>friends, with Mr. Seddon, would get me assigned to the part I desire to
</p>
<p>play in the grand comedy cr tragedy, as the case may be ; but if it is
</p>
<p>to be managed by the citizens of Richmond, my chances are not so goodj
</p>
<p>and I may have to depend entirely on you. Speak a good word for
</p>
<p>me at once, and I will see you next week. As I told you, I would
</p>
<p>willingly sell my soul to the devil for the honor of playing a conspicu-
</p>
<p>tHis part in the destruction of the great hydra.
</p>
<p>"My arm is nearly well, and I find it quite useful again, as you wil!
</p>
<p>conclude from my being able to dispense with an amanuensis.
</p>
<p>" Don't neglect me.
</p>
<p>" Tour sincere friend, Cullum."
</p>
<p>Now, it is remarkable that this kidnapping scheme is the
</p>
<p>same which Booth at first contemplated, as shown in his re-
</p>
<p>cently published letter, but which he subsequently abandoned

<p>for the assassination. If, then, one part of the plot of
</p>
<p>'60 L I F E A N D M A R T Y R D M
</p>
<p>wliicli Booth was the agent, was concocted at Eichmond by
</p>
<p>Davis, Seddon and Benjamin, is it not like that tliey knew
</p>
<p>of the other part and of the more horrible shape which it
</p>
<p>finally took ? There are unwritten chapters which will be
</p>
<p>unfolded to the public, as the trial of the chief conspirators
</p>
<p>progresses. There are chapters of such horrid detail and
</p>
<p>extensive combinations, that will startle the country equal to
</p>
<p>anything which has transpired since the commencement of
</p>
<p>the rebellion. The public have no idea of the extent to
</p>
<p>which the authorities have probed this plot. The accounts
</p>
<p>published give but a faint idea. They know the chief actor
</p>
<p>in the tragedy has been tracked and fallowed through Mary-
</p>
<p>land, and hunted down in Virginia, and how he died like a
</p>
<p>dog ; but this is only one portion of the whole affair
</p>
<p> only one branch of the main stream which has been gone
</p>
<p>over. In almost every other respect, equal success crowned
</p>
<p>the efforts of the authorities ; and in flict some instances, with
</p>
<p>much greater success, as the public will see in due course
</p>
<p>of time. The persons taken into custody as participators,
</p>
<p>aiders and abettors, or in some way accomplices to the
</p>
<p>tragic deed, are numbered almost by hundreds. There are
</p>
<p>still a few at large, and until they are captured it will not
</p>
<p>be the part of wisdom to give details and developments in
</p>
<p>full, which have transpired. It is but proper to state that
</p>
<p>the principal actors  the men, who, on the night of the four-
</p>
<p>teenth of April, were at their posts, and performed their al-
</p>
<p>lotted portion of the work  are in limbo.
</p>
<p>The facts are not conclusive where the plot originated, but
</p>
<p>circumstances point strongly to its being the work of the
</p>
<p>fire-eating Southerners, who by their flaming speeches and

<p>boasts that a Brutus would arise to plant the dagger in the
</p>

</p>
<p>breast of the first anti-slavery President that was ever elected,
</p>
<p>gave the idea to their followers which has been put into prac-
</p>
<p>tice by the over zealous fanatics in our midst who had not
</p>
<p>the courage, to enter the Southern armies, and fight for the
</p>
<p>cause which they pretended to uphold. Whether the detail or
</p>
<p>the employment of the leading men in the tragedy was the
</p>
<p>work of the rebel conspirators who had sought refuge
</p>
<p>in Canada or not the facts at the trial will no doubt tell.
</p>
<p>The fact that some of the parties connected with it were
</p>
<p>participators in the St. Albans' raid, and Confederates in the
</p>
<p>attempt to burn New York city last Fall furnishes strong cir-
</p>
<p>cumstantial evidence, that the same brain that planned or insti-
</p>
<p>gated those atrocious deeds instigated and set in motion the .
</p>
<p>plot for assassinating our late, lamented Chief Magistrate.
</p>
<p>The conspirators were bound together by one of the strongest
</p>
<p>oaths ever taken by mortals and every person who was ad-
</p>
<p>mitted to the secret, was bound to remain faithful to the end
</p>
<p>at the penalty of death  his life to be taken by one of his
</p>
<p>associates. Many of the Confederates were not taken fully
</p>
<p>into the secret, and those only were allowed to approach it
</p>
<p>who by degrees had their faithfulness tested. The authori-
</p>
<p>ties have been fortunate enough to ascertain where, when,
</p>
<p>and how often the conspirators held their meetings, and
</p>
<p>have taken into custody the people who occupied the houses
</p>
<p>where they met. The number which were taken into the se-
</p>
<p>cret before the consummation of the deed, was so large that
</p>
<p>it is astonishing that some one of the number did not re-
</p>
<p>veal it.
</p>
<p>It seems that about three weeks before the plans were put

<p>into execution, one of the parties revolted at the part of the
</p>
<p>62 LIFEANDMARTTKDOM
</p>
<p>work whhh the leaders had allotted to him on the eventful
</p>
<p>night, aud at once manifested a desire to withdraw. He
</p>
<p>was, hcvever, reminded of his oath and every eflfort made to
</p>
<p>bring him up to his work. But the more he thought of it
</p>
<p>the more he became alarmed at the fearful propositiun of the
</p>
<p>hellish schemes. After several days parlying, he succeeded in
</p>
<p>getting the consent of his associates to relieve him from all
</p>
<p>further connection with them, on condition that he should
</p>
<p>leave the city and not return for sixty days. He left the
</p>
<p>city, and was somewhere within the limits of the Army of
</p>
<p>the Potomac, when the news came there of the Assassination
</p>
<p>of the President. He repaired immediately to Fortress Mon-
</p>
<p>roe and gave himself up and was sent to Washington, ar-
</p>
<p>riving there the next morning after the funeral services of
</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln at the White House. When taken before the
</p>
<p>authorities he made a f\ill confession of all he knew of the
</p>
<p>plot, n'i to where and when they met, and who were con-
</p>
<p>cerned in it. It is understood that the proclamation issued
</p>
<p>during that day by Secretary Stanton, offering an additional
</p>
<p>reward for Booth, also rewards for Atzerot and Harrold, was
</p>
<p>based xipon the confession of this prisoner. At any rate the
</p>
<p>arreste on that day were numerous, and several residents of
</p>
<p>Washington were among the number. This opened the way
</p>
<p>fbr further important developments.
</p>
<p>The number engaged in executing the plot is very large.
</p>
<p>Besides Booth and his accomplices, in and around the
</p>
<p>theatre, the assassin of Mr. Seward, and Atzerot at the
</p>
<p>Kirkvirood, there were a number engaged in cutting the
</p>
<p>telegraph wires leading from the War Department, and

</p>
<p>still another set endeavoring to divert the attention of the
</p>
<p>OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. , 63
</p>
<p>authorities from the fleeing culprits. It appears that at
</p>
<p>precisely ten minutes past ten there were twenty-two wires
</p>
<p>leading from the War Office in different directions, and
</p>
<p>connecting with the fortifications and out-posts cut. These
</p>
<p>wires having been cut at a considerable distance from each
</p>
<p>other, together with the simultaneousness of this work,
</p>
<p>shows very plainly that a number of men were engaged
</p>
<p>in it, and it is now believed that there were twenty-two
</p>
<p>men appointed to do this work. The time at which this
</p>
<p>was accomplished furnishes beyond a doubt, the hour which
</p>
<p>the President was assassinated, which has been stated all
</p>
<p>the way from half-past nine to half-past ten. It probably
</p>
<p>did not vary much from ten o'clock.
</p>
<p>The numerous stories in reference to the contemplated
</p>
<p>assassination of all the leading officials in the government
</p>
<p>are not at all to be credited. The evidence thus far ob-
</p>
<p>tained, shows that the schemes only contemplated the as-
</p>
<p>sassination of the President, Vice-President and Secretary
</p>
<p>Seward,  no more and no less. For some reason the per-
</p>
<p>son who was to execute the programme on Mr. Johnson
</p>
<p>failed to do his work. Booth is the only man who car-
</p>
<p>ried out his part of the work to the letter. The would-
</p>
<p>be assassin of Mr. Seward no doubt considered that he had
</p>
<p>performed his work thoroughly, but providential circum-
</p>
<p>stances prevented his blows being effective.
</p>
<p>Justice bids fair to be swift in visiting these culprits
</p>

<p>The President and General Grant had been invited to
</p>
<p>attend Ford's theatre, in "Washington, on the evening of
</p>
<p>the fourteenth, and both had accepted the invitation. Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Grant was called North and left Washington during
</p>
<p>the evening. The President attended the theatre lest the
</p>
<p>audience might be entirely disapiDointed, in consequence of
</p>
<p>General Grant's absence. Shortly after the President and
</p>
<p>party entered the box and had become interested in the
</p>
<p>performance, John Wilkes Booth was seen, by one wHo
</p>
<p>knew him well, passing along the dress circle toward the
</p>
<p>President's box, when he came to within a step or two of
</p>
<p>the door of the box Booth stopped, and taking off his hat
</p>
<p>held it in his left hand, while he leaned against the wall
</p>
<p>behind him. In this attitude he remained for about half
</p>
<p>a minute, then stepping down one step he put his hand on
</p>
<p>the door- and bent his knee against it; the door opened
</p>
<p>and Booth entered. The shot was the next thing, Booth
</p>
<p>stood upright with both hands raised, but at that moment
</p>
<p>no weapon or any thing else, in either hand was seen.
</p>
<p>He then sprang to the front of the box, laid his left
</p>
<p>hand on the railway, but was checked for an instant evi-
</p>

<p>or being held back by somebody, A knife was now seen
</p>
<p>in bis right hand, which he also laid upon the railing
</p>
<p>where he already had his left, and vaulted out. As his
</p>
<p>legs passed between the folds of the flags decorating the
</p>
<p>box, his spur, which he wore on the right heel, caught
</p>
<p>the drapery and brought it down, tearing a strip with it.
</p>
<p>When he let go the railing he still clutched the shining
</p>
<p>knife. He crouched as he fell, falling on one knee and
</p>
<p>putting forth both hands to help himself to recover an
</p>
<p>erect position, which he did with the rapidity and easy
</p>
<p>agility of an athlete. As he strode across the stage he
</p>
<p>shouted the motto of Virginia " Sic semper tyranyiis," floiu--
</p>
<p>ishing his knife as he passed. When he reached the other
</p>
<p>side of the stage, just before he became invisible by pass-
</p>
<p>ing into the entrance, he looked up and was heard to
</p>
<p>say, "I have done it," and was then lost sight of.

<p>It has been generally understood, and the family encour-
</p>
<p>aged the belief, that Junius Brutus Booth, Sr., was legally
</p>
<p>married to the lady who passed in this country as his second
</p>
<p>wife. Indeed, when some seven years ago, the announcement
</p>
<p>of the death of the first wife, Mrs. Mary Booth, in Balti-
</p>
<p>more, was made in a New York paper, the statement that she
</p>
<p>had been divorced being added, the sons united in a card,
</p>
<p>which was published in that journal, setting forth that their
</p>
<p>father had had but one wife, and that one their mother,
</p>
<p>then (and now) living  the putative Mrs. Rosalie Booth, from
</p>
<p>whom he had never been divorced. This, however, was in^
</p>
<p>correct. The elder Booth was a married man at the time he

<p>last appeared at Covent Garden Theatre. While there, he
</p>
<p>chanced to meet in the Covent Garden Market, (then as well
</p>
<p>known as Haymarket) a flower-girl named Rosalie, who reg-
</p>
<p>ularly sold flowers to market customers in that quarter of
</p>
<p>London. She possessed rare personal attractions, and was, in
</p>
<p>fact, exceedingly beautiful. Booth cultivated an acquaintance
</p>
<p>with her, which ripened into intimacy, and resulted in an
</p>
<p>elopement, Booth at once taking passage for America, where
</p>
<p>the fair Rosalie was presented as, and passed for, his wife.
</p>
<p>By his first wife, he had one child, at the time of his
</p>
<p>desertion from her  an infant. When she ascertained where
</p>
<p>Booth had gone, she also followed, bringing the child with
</p>
<p>her, afid subsequently took up her residence in Baltimore.
</p>
<p>This child, when arrived at man's estate, adopted the profes-
</p>
<p>sion of the law, and Richard Booth, Esq., was afterward
</p>
<p>known as a prominent member of the Boston bar. He never
</p>
<p>so much as recognized the other children of Booth, and for
</p>
<p>years did not speak to his father. It was probably out of
</p>
<p>consideration for this child, that the elder Booth did not
</p>
<p>sue for a writ of divorce from his wife Mary ; if, indeed,
</p>
<p>there were any grounds upon which he could hope to obtain
</p>
<p>the desired legal severance, without which, it seems a second
</p>
<p>marriage was out of the question. Her troubles and trials
</p>
<p>led her gradually into habits of dissipation. She became al-
</p>
<p>most as intemperate as Booth himself, and it was a custom
</p>
<p>with her, when in liquor, to haunt the Baltimore markets
</p>
<p>for a chance meeting with the woman who had usurped her
</p>
<p>place in the heart and home of her husband. These en-
</p>
<p>counters were as much avoided by the one, as sought for by
</p>
<p>the other. Mrs. Booth assailed Rosalie with violent, oflen

<p>coarse language, opprobrious epithets, whicli the other never
</p>
<p>resented, but cut short by the speediest exit. The fact grow-
</p>
<p>ing out of this condition of affairs is, that the children 
</p>
<p>Junius Brutus, Edwin Forrest, John Wilkes, Joseph and the
</p>
<p>sisters  are of illegitimate birth ; and it is a fact which
</p>
<p>would probably have died out with the few who were privy
</p>
<p>to it, but for the great crime which has quickened public
</p>
<p>curiosity and unlocked the secrets of the family charnel-house,
</p>
<p>whose gates had been so securely closed and guarded by
</p>
<p>the children, in their struggle for professional rank and so-
</p>
<p>cial position, that even a legal inquisition could hardly have
</p>
<p>forced them ajar. They were all greatly attached to their mother,
</p>
<p>and it was their custom, when fulfilling engagements through-
</p>
<p>out the country, to remit their funds to her in trust, ex-
</p>
<p>cept so much as was necessary to defray their personal ex
</p>
<p>penses.
</p>
<p>The elder Booth was an English tragedian, born in Lon-
</p>
<p>don in the year 1796. During his minority he played in
</p>
<p>several of the provincial English theatres with moderate
</p>
<p>success, and in 1814 made his debut at Coven t Garden
</p>
<p>Theatre, in his native city as Richard III. His per-
</p>
<p>sonal resemblance to " that hunch-backed toad " conformed
</p>
<p>so well to the stage-traditions, and his personification of
</p>
<p>the character was, in other respects so striking, that he at
</p>
<p>once took a prominent rank in his profession, and success-
</p>
<p>fully competed with Edmund Kean, then the rising star of
</p>
<p>the English stage, at Drury Lane Theatre. He shortly after
</p>
<p>played with Kean at the Drury, and was subsequently an-
</p>
<p>nounced to reappear at Covent Garden. Meantime an affair
</p>
<p>occurred which rendered him very unpopular with the

</p>
<p>public, and his reappearance was the signal for a serious
</p>
<p>68 LIFEANDMABTTRDOM
</p>
<p>theatrical riot, which resulted in driving him temporarily
</p>
<p>from the London stage. We do not distinctly recollect the
</p>
<p>particulars. Jealousy, professional or otherwise, stirred up
</p>
<p>the fiery nature of Booth and he attempted the life of the
</p>
<p>obnoxious person, but failed to take it. The man survived
</p>
<p>the assault, and is now we believe, a resident of St. Louis.
</p>
<p>Booth remained in England till about the year 1820, when
</p>
<p>he crossed the Atlantic, and made his first professional ap-
</p>
<p>pearance in this country at Petersburg, Virginia, and the
</p>
<p>year following at the Park Threatre, New York, on both
</p>
<p>of which occasions he assumed his favorite role of "Richard
</p>
<p>III." From that time to the close of his life he fulfilled
</p>
<p>engagements in nearly, if not every theatre in the United
</p>
<p>States, and was accounted one of the greatest actors of his
</p>
<p>time, though the range of characters which he assumed was
</p>
<p>limited, and was confined almost exclusively to those which
</p>
<p>he had studied in the beginning of his career. Having se-
</p>
<p>cured a moderate competence, Booth purchased a property
</p>
<p>near Baltmore, known as " The Farm," where, during his
</p>
<p>latter years he resided, making occasional professional visits
</p>
<p>to other cities. He made an excursion to California some-
</p>
<p>where about the year 1850, where he fulfilled a very lucra-
</p>
<p>tive engagement, and on his way home stopped in New Or-
</p>
<p>leans, where he made his last appearance at the St. Charles,
</p>
<p>as Sir Giles Overreach, in "A New Way to Pay Old Debts."
</p>
<p>It was while on his passage from that city to Cincinnati
</p>
<p>that he died. His remains were taken to "The Farm" for
</p>
<p>kurial.
</p>
<p>Booth's habits were exceedingly irregular, and so interfered
</p>
<p>with his performances at times that an actor less gifted

</p>
<p>would have forfeited his popularity beyond redemption. It
</p>
<p>OPABRAHAMLINCOLN. W
</p>
<p>was rarely that he appeared sober oa the stage, and, toward
</p>
<p>the close of his life, it required all the vigilance and art of
</p>
<p>managers to keep him in a condition to appear on the stage
</p>
<p>at all. The stories told of him in this connection are in-
</p>
<p>numerable, and some of them extremely ludicrous. His ap-
</p>
<p>petite for liquor was absolutely voracious. Being without
</p>
<p>money at one time in New York, he went to a pawn brok-
</p>
<p>er's shop, literally pawned himself for money to purchase
</p>
<p>liquor, was regularly ticketed and exhibited in a window,
</p>
<p>where he staid till "redeemed" by a friend. On another oc-
</p>
<p>cason, being announced to appear in Philadelphia  at the
</p>
<p>Walnut street, we believe  the manager, on the day for the
</p>
<p>performance, had Booth locked up, but was outwitted by the
</p>
<p>actor, who bribed the servant to bring a bottle of brandy, a
</p>
<p>saucer and a clay pipe. Inserting the pipe through the key-
</p>
<p>hole, with the bowl inverted, the brandy was poured into
</p>
<p>the saucer, and sucked up through the pipe by the thirsty
</p>
<p>tragedian, and the fact was disclosed when in the twilight
</p>
<p>the manager proceeded there to conduct him to the dressing-
</p>
<p>room, and found him in an insensible condition. It was con
</p>
<p>sidered somewhat perilous to play Richmond to Booth's Rich-
</p>
<p>ard III, particularly if the actor was in liquor. During the
</p>
<p>combat on Bosworth field, he was apt, in his excitement, to
</p>
<p>consider himself in reality the King, and cut and thrust
</p>
<p>with the earnestness and ferocity of a man engaged in au_
</p>
<p>earnest and life-depending trial of arms. At such times it
</p>
<p>was necessary to disable him, and it was in one of these
</p>
<p>"crazy spells" that his face was disfigured for life by an im-r
</p>
<p>perilled actor, the bridge of his nose being broken by tha

<p>10' LIFEANDMARTTRDOM
</p>
<p>The very ludicrous scene -whicli occurred at a New York
</p>
<p>theatre, between Booth and the celebrated " fat girl," of Barnum's
</p>
<p>Museum, is probably familiar to many, and is, perhaps, one of
</p>
<p>the most amusing incidents in the annals of the stage. It is
</p>
<p>very doubtful whether Booth was insane at any time when
</p>
<p>not under the influence of strong drink. He was, however, of
</p>
<p>a very fiery quality, and in his peculiar sphere  the sudden
</p>
<p>and nervous expression of concentrated passion, as also in the
</p>
<p>more quiet and subtle passages of his delineations  he was,
</p>
<p>perhaps, unsurpassed by any actor of his time, and would have
</p>
<p>passed for crazy if it were supposed he was guided in his
</p>
<p>dramatic out-bursts by feeling rather than artistic skill. On
</p>
<p>the stage the elder Booth, was convivial, genial, warm-hearted,
</p>
<p>and as much loved in his profession as he was admired.
</p>
<p>John Wilkes Booth  the infamous  was born on "the
</p>
<p>Farm," near Baltimore, Md., in 1838, and is consequently but
</p>
<p>twenty-seven years old. He made his first stage appearance
</p>
<p>in 1855, at Eichmond, in " Richard III," at the St. Charles
</p>
<p>Theatre in Baltimore, and in the fall of 1857, appeared under
</p>
<p>the name of Wilkes at the Arch-street Theatre in Philadelphia
</p>
<p>where he played stock parts during the entire season. The
</p>
<p>name of Wilkes was given him by his father, in honor of
</p>
<p>an old Baltimore friend, Jim Wilkes, a successful merchant
</p>
<p>and great wit. Young Booth next became a member of the
</p>
<p>Kichmond, Ya., Theatre, improved rapidly in his profession,
</p>
<p>and became a great favorite there. During the season of
</p>
<p>1860 and 1861 wc find him engaged still further South, play-
</p>
<p>ing chiefly at Montgomery and Columbus, Ga. Probably not
</p>
<p>fancying conscription into the Southern Army, however much

</p>
<p>he favored the cause, he escaped North, and in 1861 and
</p>
<p>OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN, 11
</p>
<p>1862 played in St. Louis, Louisville, and other western cit-
</p>
<p>ies. It was during the season following, we believe, that he
</p>
<p>first appeared in Cincinnati, at Wood's Theatre, and left the
</p>
<p>impression, that though rather an unequal actor, as might be
</p>
<p>expected of one of his limited experience, he gave un-
</p>
<p>mistakable evidence of dramatic talent. He had, added to
</p>
<p>his native genius, of a voice musically full and rich, a face
</p>
<p>almost classic in outline, features highly intellectual, a pierc-
</p>
<p>ing black eye, capable of expressing the fiercest and the
</p>
<p>tenderest passion and emotion, and a commanding figure and
</p>
<p>impressive stage address. In his transitions from the quiet
</p>
<p>and reflective passages of a part too fierce and violent out-
</p>
<p>breaks of passion, his sudden and impetuous manner had in
</p>
<p>it something of that electrical force and power which mado
</p>
<p>the elder Booth so celebrated, and called up afresh to the
</p>
<p>memory of men of the last generation, the presence, voice,
</p>
<p>and manner of his father. Convivial in his habits, sprightly
</p>
<p>and genial in conversation, John Wilkes made many acquain-
</p>
<p>tances and friends among the young men of his own age in
</p>
<p>the city  an acquaintance that was renewed during two sub-
</p>
<p>sequent engagements.
</p>
<p>Our recollection of Booth is somewhat indistinct ; but we
</p>
<p>remember his features in repose had rather a sombre and
</p>
<p>melancholy cast; yet under agreeable influence or emotion,
</p>
<p>the expression was very animated and glowing. His hair, jet
</p>
<p>black and glossy, curled slightly, set off in due relief a
</p>
<p>high intellectual forehead and face full of intelligence. Both
</p>
<p>chin and nose were markedly prominent, and the firm set
</p>
<p>lips and lines about the mouth indicated firmness of will,

</p>
<p>decision, and resolution. He was scrupulously neat in his
</p>
<p>it LIFEAKDMARTIRDOU
</p>
<p>dress, and selected his habit with a rare perception of what
</p>
<p>was becoming to his figure and complexion. He would pass
</p>
<p>any where for a neatly, but not overly, dressed man of
</p>
<p>fashion.
</p>
<p>Of his political views very little was known. He kept a
</p>
<p>still tongue on the subject, so far as we have heard. Being
</p>
<p>of Southern birth and education, it was presumed his sym-
</p>
<p>pathies tended in that direction; but he exhibited no par-
</p>
<p>ticular warmth or zeal for the Rebellion, and nothing to in-
</p>
<p>dicate the remotest desire to further the cause b}' so much
</p>
<p>as giving it pecuniary aid, much less personal assistance. It
</p>
<p>is reported by a gentleman who heard the conversation, that
</p>
<p>during his engagement in Louisville in 1862, Booth fell
</p>
<p>into a controversy with the treasurer of the theatre  a rabid
</p>
<p>secessionist  while standing one morning in the box-oflBce.
</p>
<p>He remarked in eifect that he was a Southern man, and
</p>
<p>liked the people of the South, who had been kind to him,
</p>
<p>but he could not, for all that, admit that they had any
</p>
<p>right or occasion to secede; that they had it all their own
</p>
<p>way in Congress, and that if they insisted on fighting they
</p>
<p>should have taken the American flag and fought under that.
</p>
<p>There is another story, to the efi"ect that Booth, while play-
</p>
<p>ing an engagement in Cleveland a year or more ago, assert-
</p>
<p>ed rn a public bar-room that the man who would kill Abra-
</p>
<p>ham Lincoln would gain a more enviable notoriety than
</p>
<p>"Washington himself. It is of course impossible to say whether
</p>
<p>these reported sayings are apocryphal or not.
</p>
<p>The last appearance of Booth on the stage (except at
</p>
<p>one or two benefits in "Washington), was at the "Winter Gar-

<p>win and Junius Brutus, in the play of "Julius Caesar," for
</p>
<p>the benefit of the Shakespeare Monument Fund. He was,
</p>
<p>we believe, to have played with them again at the same
</p>
<p>theatre, on the 22d of April, for the benefit of the
</p>
<p>same fund. The play selected was "Romeo and Juliet", the
</p>
<p>cast of the Booths being  John Wilkes as Borneo, Edwin as
</p>
<p>Mercutio, and Junius as Friar Lawrence.
</p>
<p>As the public journals have been and are still filled with
</p>
<p>paragraphs concerning Booth's connection with the oil busi-
</p>
<p>ness, it may prove interesting to learn that the War De-
</p>
<p>partment have thoroughly examined this matter, and the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing are the facts established :
</p>
<p>" J. Wilkes Booth never was in the oil regions of Penn,-
</p>
<p>sylvania but 07ice, and that was last summer. He stayed two
</p>
<p>days at the Petroleum House in Oil City, and then started,
</p>
<p>as he said, for New York. He is traced to Salamanca and
</p>
<p>thence to Buffalo, whence it is supposed he went into Canada.
</p>
<p>He never purchased a single barrel of oil anywhere in the
</p>
<p>whole oil territory of this State, never purchased, owned or
</p>
<p>rented a lease, well, or parcel of ground in the State. Not
</p>
<p>a single oil company is yet found in which he ever held a
</p>
<p>single share or interest of any kind ! Not a solitary indi-
</p>
<p>vidual can be found who ever sold him anything, or traded
</p>
<p>or bartered with him for anything in the oil regions. And
</p>
<p>the most singular circumstance is that not a single individual
</p>
<p>can be found in the oil regions of Pennsylvania who ever
</p>
<p>met Booth here and knew him at the time !

<p>Church. He says, at that time desiring to lead a new life, he
</p>
<p>changed his former given name and was baptized "Boston."
</p>
<p>His subsequent residence has been in New York, when he
</p>
<p>enlisted in the 16th Cavalry. He is as modest as he is de-
</p>
<p>voted, and his lieutenant pronounces him a most worthy sol-
</p>
<p>dier. He was offered one of Booth's pistols by the detect-
</p>
<p>ives as a momento of the occasion ; but he declined it say-
</p>
<p>ing, he desired no reminder of the sad duty he had to per-
</p>
<p>form, and desired to have it banished from his mind as soon
</p>
<p>as possible. He was recently offered one hundred dollars
</p>
<p>for his own pistol with which he killed Booth ; but he in-
</p>
<p>stantly replied, "That is not mine  it belongs to the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and I would not sell it for any price." Being spoken
</p>
<p>to about the large reward, he replied he desired no reward
</p>
<p>for having done what God made manifest to him, in answer
</p>
<p>to prayer, was his duty to do. He remarked, however, that
</p>
<p>if the Government wished to reward him, and would allow
</p>
<p>him to keep his little horse, when his term of service was
</p>
<p>over, it would be all he could wish.
</p>
<p>PURSUIT AND CAPTURE.
</p>
<p>The first traces of Booth were discovered by Col. Baker,
</p>
<p>who recently made the successful raid on the bounty jump-
</p>
<p>ers and brokers of Xew York city. It appears that Booth's
</p>
<p>leg was fractured in jumping from the President's box. Upon
</p>
<p>mounting his horse he proceeded toward the lower counties
</p>
<p>of Maryland, after being joined by Harrold who was intimate-
</p>
<p>ly acquainted with the swamps and biding places of that

<p>region. At first, Booth scarcely noticed his leg; but after
</p>
<p>riding a few miles, the pain became so intense that he went
</p>
<p>to the house of Dr. Mudd, in Charles county, and had it
</p>
<p>set at 3 o'clock in the morning of Sunday, April 16th, the
</p>
<p>second day after the murder of the President. Dr. Mudd
</p>
<p>split Booth's boot open to get it off, and when he left the
</p>
<p>doctor gave him a pair of crutches, and it is supposed he
</p>
<p>left in an easterly direction from the neighborhood of Bry-
</p>
<p>antown. They then reached Turner's, about five miles from
</p>
<p>Bryantown, and while taking some refreshments, the servant
</p>
<p>was sent to inform the neighbors of their presence, Booth
</p>
<p>having been recognized. They discovered the dilemma they
</p>
<p>were in, and seizing the food on the table, decamped and
</p>
<p>took refuge in the swamps and underbrush. Some lady in
</p>
<p>Maryland presented Booth with a buffalo robe which was
</p>
<p>consumed in the fire at Garrett's barn, in which he was
</p>
<p>captured. Col. Baker's force traced him to Dr. Mudd'g
</p>
<p>house, and the doctor was arrested by the military, with
</p>
<p>one of Booth's boots in his possession, which had Booth's
</p>
<p>name in it. The doctor was immediately taken to Washing-
</p>
<p>ton.
</p>
<p>Learnins; that no traces of him could be found after his
</p>
<p>departure from the house of Dr. Mudd, near Port Tobacco,
</p>
<p>where his fractured leg was set. Col. Baker became satisfied
</p>
<p>that Booth must have crossed the Potomac and escaped into
</p>
<p>Virginia, at, or near, Aquia Creek. He therefore procured an
</p>
<p>order for General Hancock to furnish him twenty-six picked
</p>
<p>cavalrymen to act as an escort to his brother. Lieutenant

<p>them upon a route which a cardTul consultation of the map
</p>
<p>T6 LIFE AND MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>of Virginia had indicated as the one most likely to be taken
</p>
<p>by Booth. They proceeded down the river to Belle Plain,
</p>
<p>in the steamer Ides, and thence disembarking, rode across to
</p>
<p>a point opposite Port Royal on the Rappahannock. Here waa
</p>
<p>a scow ferry, and the ferryman was critically questioned as
</p>
<p>to the passage of any such party as Booth and Harrold.
</p>
<p>The Virginia ferryman could remember nothing of such per-
</p>
<p>sons ; but while Lieutenant Baker was exhibiting Booth's pho-
</p>
<p>tograph with the view of refreshing his memory, a darker col-
</p>
<p>ored but more loyal Virginian, employed as an assistant on
</p>
<p>the ferry, happened to see the photograph over the detec-
</p>
<p>tive's shoulder, and instantly replied, "Yes, master, I knows
</p>
<p>dat man, I set um across de river t'other day, wid three
</p>
<p>Oder men, in two boss wagon." The white proprietor could
</p>
<p>remember nothing whatever, yet the trail was deemed good.
</p>
<p>At Port Eoyal they took the Bowling Green Road, and pass-
</p>
<p>ed the farm bouse of the Garretts, which, being about a
</p>
<p>quarter of a mile from the road they passed, and rode on
</p>
<p>several miles. This was about 3 o'clock, A. M. They met
</p>
<p>another colored Virginian, however, and from him learned
</p>
<p>that a party, such as was inquired for, was left at Mr. Gar-
</p>
<p>rett's two days before, by two rebel oflacers. The party then
</p>
<p>wheeled and returned to Garrett's house. Lieutenant Baker
</p>
<p>dismounted and demanded admittance and the surrender of
</p>
<p>Booth. The senior Garrett denied all knowledge of Booth ;
</p>
<p>but seeing Baker manipulate his revolver, bethought him of
</p>
<p>two Confederate soldiers who had been stopping at his house,
</p>
<p>one of whom was wounded. He pretended he knew nothing
</p>
<p>of their names ; he said they had been apprised that the

</p>
<p>Union cavalry was about and had left the house, demanding
</p>
<p>OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. It
</p>
<p>his horses and saying they must get away ; but he (Gar-
</p>
<p>rett) stoutly refused to let his horses go, fearing, he said,
</p>
<p>he should never get them again. So Booth and Harrold
</p>
<p>fled to the barn, and Garrett sent his son to watch the
</p>
<p>baim to see that they did not steal the horses, and that
</p>
<p>he was at that moment hiding in the corn-house adjoining
</p>
<p>the barn. This was found to be as stated. Lieutenant Ba-
</p>
<p>ker then went to the barn door and knocked heavily with
</p>
<p>his revolver upon the door, shouting out, "Booth, Booth."
</p>
<p>After a protracted silence, Baker continued the knocking
</p>
<p>and calling  Booth came to the door and asked, "Who are
</p>
<p>you, and what do you want ? Are you Confederate or Yan-
</p>
<p>kee?" Baker replied, giving his name, when Booth de-
</p>
<p>clared he would shoot the first man who attempted to enter
</p>
<p>the barn.
</p>
<p>When challenged to come out and surrender, he, in a very
</p>
<p>wild and excited tone, demanded to know who they supposed
</p>
<p>him to be and by what authority, desiring to know of what
</p>
<p>crime he was charged, and evincing the greatest excitement
</p>
<p>and talking very incoherently. The officers demanded him to
</p>
<p>come forth and give himself up. He refused to do so and
</p>
<p>threatened to shoot whoever should approach. He said he
</p>
<p>was alone there, but he would never surre'nder. Sergeant
</p>
<p>Boston Corbett was stationed at a corner of the barn where
</p>
<p>there was a board off, and where he was exposed to Booth's
</p>
<p>fire. He expressed a desire to go in and secure him, saying
</p>
<p>he was willing to venture his life in the encounter and had
</p>
<p>much rather go in and attack him than to stand in his ex-
</p>
<p>posed position ; but it was so evident that Booth meant to
</p>
<p>sell his life as dearly as possible, that Lieutenant Doherty

</p>
<p>would not permit him to enter. The officers then gave Booth
</p>
<p>78 LIFE AND MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>five minutes to surrender or else the barn would be fired.
</p>
<p>Nearly a half hour was consumed in the parley, however,
</p>
<p>when fire was set to the barn. During the progress of the
</p>
<p>flames Booth was seen by Corbett, aiming his Spencer car-
</p>
<p>bine at one of the men. Corbett, who is a deeply religious
</p>
<p>man, ^says he prayed fervently for Booth, and that God
</p>
<p>would have mercy upon his soul, and feeling that he was
</p>
<p>justified in shooting him to prevent the possible death of
</p>
<p>another innocent man, approached the crack in the barn lev-
</p>
<p>eled his revolver and fired. His shot, by a strange coinci-
</p>
<p>dence, entered his head in almost precisely the same spot
</p>
<p>that President Lincoln was shot; the ball passed through
</p>
<p>and out of the upper part of the neck on the opposite side.
</p>
<p>Booth instantly fell, and his carbine dropped heavily with
</p>
<p>him. He was standing at the time supported by a crutch ;
</p>
<p>his body was immediately removed from the burning barn.
</p>
<p>This took place just at daybreak of the 26th of April, and
</p>
<p>he lived till almost seven o'clock.
</p>
<p>Booth and Harrold reached Garrett's on the 24th, Booth
</p>
<p>walking on crutches. A party of four or five accompanied
</p>
<p>them who spoke of Booth as a wounded Marylander on his
</p>
<p>way home, and that they wished to leave him there a short
</p>
<p>time, and they would take him away by the 20th. Booth
</p>
<p>limped somewhat and walked on crutches about the place
</p>
<p>complaining of his ankle. He and Harrold regularly took
</p>
<p>their meals at the house, and both kept up appearances well.
</p>
<p>One day at the dinner table the conversation turned on the
</p>
<p>assassination of the President, when Booth denounced the
</p>
<p>crime in the strongest terms, saying that there was no pun-
</p>
<p>ishment severe enough for the perpetrator. At another time,

</p>
<p>some one said in Booth's presence that rewards amounting to
</p>
<p>OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 79
</p>
<p>$200,000 had been oflfered for Booth, and that he would like
</p>
<p>to catch him, when Booth replied, ' Yes, it would be a
</p>
<p>good haul, but the amount will doubtless soon be increased
</p>
<p>to $500,000." The Garretts, who lived on the place, allege
</p>
<p>that they had no idea that these parties, Booth and Har-
</p>
<p>rold, were any other than what their friends represented them
</p>
<p> paroled Confederate soldiers on their way home. They
</p>
<p>also say, that when the cavalry appeared in that neighbor-
</p>
<p>hood and they heard they weie looking for the assassins that
</p>
<p>they sent word to them that these two men were on the
</p>
<p>place. In other words they assert that they are entirely in-
</p>
<p>nocent of giving the assassins any aid and comfort, knowing
</p>
<p>them to be such.
</p>
<p>Another account says, that the detachment of the 16th
</p>
<p>New York Cavalry under Lieutenant Doherty, numbering
</p>
<p>twenty-eight men and accompanied by two of Colonel Baker's
</p>
<p>detective force, which went down the river on Monday even-
</p>
<p>ing, obtained the first news of Booth at Port Royal on Tues-
</p>
<p>day evening, from an old man who stated that four men in
</p>
<p>company with a rebel captain, had crossed the Rappahannock
</p>
<p>a short time previous going in the direction of Bowling
</p>
<p>Green, and he added that the captain would probably be
</p>
<p>found in that place, as he was courting a lady there. On
</p>
<p>pushing on to Bowling Green the captain was found at the
</p>
<p>hotel and taken into custody. From him it was ascertained
</p>
<p>that Booth and Harrold were at the house of John & Will-
</p>
<p>iam Garrett, three miles back toward Port Royal, and about
</p>
<p>a quarter of a mile from the road passed over by the cavalry.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, it appears that Booth and Harrold applied

</p>
<p>to Garrett for* horses to ride to Louisa Court House, but the
</p>
<p>80 LIFE AX D MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>latter fearing the horses would not be returned, refused tc
</p>
<p>hire them notwithstanding the large sums offered. These cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances, together with the re-criminations of Booth and
</p>
<p>Harrold, each charging the other with the responsibility of
</p>
<p>their difficulties, had aroused the suspicions of the Garrett
</p>
<p>brothers who urged Booth and Harrold to leave lest they
</p>
<p>(the Garretts) should get into trouble with the cavalry. This
</p>
<p>Booth refused to do without a horse, and the two men re-
</p>
<p>tired to a barn the door of which, after they had entered
</p>
<p>Garrett locked, and remained himself on guard in a neighbor-
</p>
<p>ing corn-crib, as he states, to prevent the horses from being
</p>
<p>taken and ridden off in the night by Booth and Harrold.
</p>
<p>Upon the approach of the cavalry from Bowling Green, about
</p>
<p>three o'clock on Wednesday morning, the Garretts came out
</p>
<p>of the corn-crib to meet them, and in answer to their inqui-
</p>
<p>ries directed them to the barn. Booth was at once sum-
</p>
<p>moned to surrender but refused. Harrold expressed his wil-
</p>
<p>lingness to give himself up but was overruled by Booth for
</p>
<p>some time ; he finally surrendered, leaving Booth in the barn.
</p>
<p>The latter then assuming a defiant air called out to know
</p>
<p>the commanding officer, and proposed to him that his men
</p>
<p>should be drawn up at fifty yards distance, when he would
</p>
<p>come out and fight them. After the barn had been burning
</p>
<p>three quarters of an hour, and when the roof was about fall-
</p>
<p>ing in Booth who had been standing with a revolver in one
</p>
<p>hand and a carbine resting on the floor made a demonstra-
</p>
<p>tion as if to break through the guard and escape. To pre-
</p>
<p>vent this Sergeant Corbutt fired intending to hit Booth in
</p>
<p>the shoulder so as to cripple him. The ball however, struck

<p>a little too high, and entered the neck, resulting fatally as

</p>
<p>before stated. In his leather belt -which he wore, was found
</p>
<p>the dirk which he so tragically brandished upon the stage,
</p>
<p>with clotted blood dried upon its blade. This knife, his car-
</p>
<p>bine and two revolvers which he also had upon his person,
</p>
<p>^holding one in each hand at the time of being shot, and
</p>
<p>while aiming his carbine, were all taken to Washington with
</p>
<p>iis body.
</p>
<p>Booth's confederate and companion Harrold came out of
</p>
<p>tie barn at the first fire in an excited state of friglit and
</p>
<p>professed contrition with his arms upraised. He also audibly
</p>
<p>besought Booth to surrender, without avail however. Booth
</p>
<p>in his forced hauteur shouted out just before Harrold left
</p>
<p>him, " Here captain is one man who wants to surrender
</p>
<p>mighty bad." He had but a moment previous insisted that
</p>
<p>no one was in the barn with him. Harrold is pronounced a
</p>
<p>mean cowardly boy. He said he wished J. Wilkes Booth had
</p>
<p>been dead before he had ever seen him, and then remarked
</p>
<p>with a silly tone and action, " He always liked Mr. Lincoln
</p>
<p>and was very fond of his jokes." Harrold was taken to Wash-
</p>
<p>ington and confined among the other prisoners.
</p>
<p>Booth, before he died, was apparently rational, but talked
</p>
<p>at random, and contradicted himself as he had done
</p>
<p>throughout, and said, "Tell my Mother, I have died for my
</p>
<p>country. You gentlemen have spoiled my fun in Mexico."
</p>
<p>He seemed conscious of the near approach of death, but
</p>
<p>died as frivilous and hardened as he had lived. His body
</p>
<p>was fully identified by his initials on bis hand, in India
</p>
<p>ink  his memorandum books and other papers, and by the
</p>
<p>personal recognition, before and after death, of the detec-
</p>
<p>tive officers who knew him. He had his moustache shaved

<p>off and had a uniform beard of four or five days. He
</p>
<p>wore a gray woolen shirt ; had on dark cassimere jiants ; one
</p>
<p>cavahy or theatre top boot which drew up above the
</p>
<p>knee, but was turned down when captured. On the other
</p>
<p>foot he had an old shoe. His leg was bandaged where it
</p>
<p>was broken. Harrold said Booth had a third revolver
</p>
<p>which was burned up in the barn. Booth wanted to know
</p>
<p>where they would take him if he would give himself up.
</p>
<p>He was informed by the detectives that he must make an
</p>
<p>unconditional surrender. He is said to have showered im-
</p>
<p>precations upon his confederates, who, he said, had promised
</p>
<p>to stand by him but had all deserted him.
</p>
<p>Booth was brought to the house of Mr. Garrett by a
</p>
<p>Confederate Captain, who told Mr. Garrett that he was a
</p>
<p>Marylander who was endeavoring to make his way to
</p>
<p>Johnston's army. Several small squads of rebel cavalry
</p>
<p>were seen hovering about, and were no doubt attempting
</p>
<p>to cover his escape.
</p>
<p>Booth had $105 in greenbacks, and sundry Canadian bills
</p>
<p>of exchange, dated last October. His hair was badly matted
</p>
<p> his clothing soiled  and the body looked more like that
</p>
<p>of a dirt bearer than that of the whilom fop.
</p>
<p>Harrold said he was outside the theatre on horse back,
</p>
<p>awaiting Booth's coming out, on the night of the murder
</p>
<p> that some how Booth got out and passed him without
</p>
<p>his seeing him, and that he galloped four miles across
</p>
<p>the Anacosta bridge, before he overtook Booth. He said

<p>and re-pass, and finally got across the Potomac by paying
</p>
<p>three hundred dollars for an old scow. Booth and Harrold
</p>
<p>narrowly escaped capture on the Maryland side of the Po-
</p>
<p>tomac. Marshal Murray and a posse of New York detec-
</p>
<p>tives, tracked them to within a short distance of Swain
</p>
<p>Point; but the Marshal being unacquainted with the coun
</p>
<p>try, and without a guide, during the darkness of the night,
</p>
<p>took the wrong road, and before he could regain the trail,
</p>
<p>Booth and Harrold succeeded in crossing the river to Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia.
</p>
<p>After the death of Booth, his body was placed in a
</p>
<p>cart and convej^ed across to Belle Plain, to the steamer
</p>
<p>Ides, which awaited the return of the party, and brought
</p>
<p>to Washington. The two Garretts, who were paroled sol-
</p>
<p>diers of Lee's army, and had just returned home, were
</p>
<p>brought up as prisoners also. Harrold, and Booth's body

<p>ATTACK ON SECRETARY SEWARD.
</p>
<p>Lewis Paine, tLe person who made tlie attempt on the life
</p>
<p>of Secretary Seward, gained admittance to the house by repre-
</p>
<p>senting himself as one sent there with a prescription. When
</p>
<p>near the room in which Mr. Seward was lying, he was met
</p>
<p>by Frederick W. Seward, who demanded who he was and
</p>
<p>what he wanted ; Payne made no reply, but striking him
</p>
<p>a blow with the butt of a pistol and cutting him with a
</p>
<p>knife, rushed into the room, he made his way to the bedside
</p>
<p>of Mr. Seward, who was lying on a low couch with his head
</p>
<p>inclined to the right. The thrusts of the knife were received
</p>
<p>in the cheek and neek. Mr. Seward's attendant came in-
</p>
<p>stantly to his aid, and the assailant thinking probably he
</p>
<p>had completed his work, grappled with him. The tussle was
</p>
<p>of some minutes duration, during which time the attendant
</p>
<p>received some very severe wounds. From loss of blood he

<p>Bank to the floor, and Payne endeavored to escape. He was

<p>PAYNE.
</p>
<p>Payne is shown to have been the confederate of Booth, and
</p>
<p>the one who assaulted with intent to kill Secretary Seward, Fred-
</p>
<p>erick W. Seward, Augustus H. Seward, Emerick N. Hansell and
</p>
<p>George F. Robinson. The antecedents of Payne are not known,
</p>
<p>and the first of him is his appearance at the house of Mrs. Surratt
</p>
<p>in the early part of March last, when he stated that his
</p>
<p>name W98 Wood. He called for John H. Surratt but in his
</p>
<p>absence he asked for Mrs. Surratt. He lodged there that night,
</p>
<p>taking his meals in his room, and departed the next day. About
</p>
<p>the same time he took a room in company with O'Laughlin in a
</p>
<p>boarding house in D street, where Booth visited them frequently.
</p>
<p>Here O'Laughlin and Payne remained about three weeks.
</p>
<p>Afterwards Payne put up two or three days at Surratt's, where
</p>
<p>John H. Surratt, Atzeroth, Booth and himself had secret consul-
</p>
<p>tations. On this second visit Payne represented to some of the
</p>
<p>members of the family that he was a Baptist preacher. He and
</p>
<p>Surratt were found at one time in the bedroom playing with bowie
</p>
<p>knives. In this same room were two revolvers, and four sets of
</p>
<p>spurs similar to the revolvers and spur found in Atzeroth's
</p>
<p>room at the Kirkwood House. At another time just before the
</p>
<p>assassination he was found occupying a room at Herndon.

</p>
<p>HARROLD.
</p>
<p>Harrold is a young man less than twenty-five years of age,
</p>
<p>a native of Washingtoji, formerly a druggist's clerk in that
</p>
<p>city, but for some months without any known means of sup-
</p>
<p>port though during that time apparently well supplied with money
</p>
<p>He has frequently been in St. Mary's county, Maryland, always
</p>
<p>taking his gun with him. On the night of the assassination he
</p>
<p>was seen at the livery stable with Booth, and the evidence
</p>
<p>obtained before the court shows him to have been Booth's
</p>
<p>accomplice. It is shown by the evidence that he was several
</p>
<p>times discovered in secret meetings with Booth, Atzeroth and
</p>
<p>others of the conspiracy. He was found at Mrs. Surratt's in
</p>
<p>company with them. Accompanied by Surratt and Atzeroth
</p>
<p>he called at the tavern in Surrattsville and left the two car-
</p>
<p>bines, the ammunition, &c., which were taken from that
</p>
<p>place by him and Booth on the night of the assassination. Dur-
</p>
<p>ing their flight he acknowledged to Confederate soldiers that
</p>
<p>he and Booth were the assassins of the President. There is no
</p>
<p>doubt whatever of his guilt, and we trust he will suffer the
</p>
<p>penalty of his crime as it shall be defined by the commis-
</p>
<p>sion.
</p>
<p>ATZEROTH.
</p>
<p>Atzeroth like Harrold is proven to have been a co-conspi-
</p>
<p>rator. He made his first appearance at Mrs. Surratt's in the
</p>
<p>early part of February, where he inquired for John H. Surratt
</p>
<p>or Mrs. Surratt, and was frequently found in secret communi-
</p>
<p>cation with Booth and his confederates. To him was assigned
</p>
<p>the murder of President Johnson at the Kirkwood house. It

<p>does not appear however that he made any effort to get access
</p>
<p>88 LIFEANDMARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>to his intended victim on the evening of the 14th of April.
</p>
<p>On the morning of that day, he took a room at Kirkwood's, and
</p>
<p>was seen there at noon, and about six o'clock in the evening.
</p>
<p>He was traced there on horseback, but was not apparently
</p>
<p>about the house after that hour. He proved false to his
</p>
<p>confederates. He was active in his co-operation with them
</p>
<p>however throughout the night and fled at daylight the next
</p>
<p>morning; of his guilt there is not a shadow of doubt.
</p>
<p>MRS. SURRATT.
</p>
<p>This worthy, it appears, was cognizant of the intended crime
</p>
<p>almost from its inception, and became an active participant in
</p>
<p>every overt act. She was a general manager, and received
</p>
<p>and entertained at her house all the criminals except Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd, O'Laughlin and Arnold. With Dr. Mudd she planned
</p>
<p>the means and assistance for the escape of the assassins.
</p>
<p>She visited Mudd at five o'clock on the day of the assas-
</p>
<p>sination, to see that the carbines, &c., should be in readiness
</p>
<p>and informed him that they would be called for that night.
</p>
<p>Booth frequently called at her house and had long interviews
</p>
<p>with her. He was with her in the afternoon of the four-
</p>
<p>teenth.
</p>
<p>DR. MUDD.
</p>
<p>Dr. Mudd's status is identical with the foregoing. Last Novem-
</p>
<p>ber he is shown to have been in the confidence of Booth. Ho
</p>
<p>had a meeting with Surratt and Booth at the National Hotel
</p>
<p>in January. He introduced Booth to Surratt. Booth visited
</p>
<p>him at his room in the Pennsylvania House. When the as-
</p>
<p>sassins fled to his house he dressed Booth's wound and

<p>assisted in the escape of Booth and Harrold.
</p>
<p>OFABRAHAMLINCOLN. 89
</p>
<p>When the officers called at his house, Thursday after the
</p>
<p>assassination, he denied that he knew either of the criminals,
</p>
<p>and at the time of his arrest on the Friday following, ho
</p>
<p>prevaricated, but finally admitted outright that he knew Booth.
</p>
<p>He says he first heard of the assassination on the Sunday
</p>
<p>after it was committed at church, and it is shown that he
</p>
<p>was in Bryantown on the preceding Saturday at the time when
</p>
<p>the excitement was at the highest pitch, the town guarded
</p>
<p>by soldiers, and every man, woman or child in the place had ,
</p>
<p>not only heard of the murder, but knew the name of the
</p>
<p>assassin. It remains to be seen what punishment the com-
</p>
<p>mission will inflict upon him.
</p>
<p>SPANGLER.
</p>
<p>Spangler does not appear to haVe been in the conspiracy
</p>
<p>at an earlier period than a few hours before the commission
</p>
<p>of the crime. If he be guilty his participation would seem
</p>
<p>to have been in preparing the means of escape by keeping
</p>
<p>the passage-way clear on the stage, and by closing the door
</p>
<p>after Booth had passed through, so as to retard the move-
</p>
<p>ments of pursuers. He knew the purpose of Booth, and
</p>
<p>promised a few minutes before the murder to help the assassin.
</p>
<p>O'LAUGHLIN.
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin is shown to have been in some kind of conspir-
</p>
<p>acy with Booth. He was assigned to murder General Grant,
</p>
<p>but whether he failed through lack of courage or from dis-
</p>
<p>inclination does not appear. Atzeroth remarked the next day,

<p>THE OBSEQUIES.
</p>
<p>On the morning of the 15th of April, at half-past nine,
</p>
<p>the President's body was removed from the private residence
</p>
<p>opposite Ford's Theatre to the Executive Mansion, in a
</p>
<p>hearse and wrapped in the America flag. It was escorted
</p>
<p>by a small guard of cavalry. Gen. Augur and other mili-
</p>
<p>tary officers followed on foot.
</p>
<p>A dense crowd accompanied the remains to the White
</p>
<p>House, where a military guard excluded the crowd, allow-
</p>
<p>ing none but persons of the household and personal friends
</p>
<p>of the deceased to enter the premises.
</p>
<p>Flags over the Departments and throughout the city
</p>
<p>were at half mast. Scarcely any business was transacted
</p>
<p>anywhere, either on private or public account. Our citi-
</p>
<p>zens, without any preconcert whatever, draped their pre-
</p>
<p>mises with festoons of mourning. The bells tolled mourn-
</p>
<p>fully, all was the deepest gloom and sadness. Strong men
</p>
<p>wept in the streets. The grief was wide-spread and deep,
</p>
<p>and in strange contrast to the joy that had been mani-
</p>
<p>fested over our recent military victories. That day was
</p>
<p>indeed a day of gloom.
</p>
<p>The body was embalmed, with a view to its removal to

<p>Illinois, and laid out in the room known as the "guests'

</p>
<p>was dressed in the suit of black clothes worn by him at
</p>
<p>his late inauguration. The catafalque upon which the
</p>
<p>body rested was placed in the south part of the east
</p>
<p>room, and was somewhat similar in style to that used on
</p>
<p>the occasion of the death of President Harrison.
</p>
<p>THE FUNERAL AT WASHINGTON.
</p>
<p>On the 18th the obsequies of the late President, at the
</p>
<p>Executive Mansion, were of the most imposing and solemn
</p>
<p>character. The pi-ocession was very large, and in its line
</p>
<p>were many of the most eminent citizens of the republic,
</p>
<p>civil, military and naval, including President Johnson, Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Grant, Vice Admiral Farragut, the members of the
</p>
<p>Cabinet, Senators, Representatives, Governors of States and
</p>
<p>numerous others of distinction. The Foreign Powers were
</p>
<p>also represented by their Ministers. The route of the pro-
</p>
<p>cession was densely thronged by thousands of spectators.
</p>
<p>Not an incident occurred to mar the solemnity of the
</p>
<p>august spectacle.
</p>
<p>The procession moved from the "White House at 2 o'clock
</p>
<p>P. M., and so great was its length that when the van
</p>
<p>reached the Capital the rear was still at Willard's Hotel,
</p>
<p>nearly a mile long.
</p>
<p>The military portion of the procession was swelled by
</p>
<p>various civic associations from Washington and other cities,
</p>
<p>and a large number of State delegations. New York^
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire,

</p>
<p>Officers of the army and navy occupied a prominent
</p>
<p>place in the procession, all wearing crape upon their arms
</p>
<p>and sword-hilts. Several colored associations were also rep-
</p>
<p>resented, one of which bore a banner with the inscription,
</p>
<p>"we mourn our loss."
</p>
<p>Death had fastened into the frozen face of the corpse
</p>
<p>all the character and idiosyncrasy of life. He had not
</p>
<p>changed one line of his grave grotesque countenance, nor
</p>
<p>smoothed out a single feature. The hue was rather blood-
</p>
<p>less and leaden; but he was always sallow. The dark eye-
</p>
<p>brows seemed abruptly arched ; the beard, which will grow
</p>
<p>no more, was shaved close, save the tuft at the short,
</p>
<p>small chin. The mouth was shut, like that of one who
</p>
<p>had put the foot down firm, and so were the eyes, which
</p>
<p>looked as calm as slumber. The collar was short and
</p>
<p>awkward, turned over the stiff elastic cravat, and whatever
</p>
<p>energy or humor or tender gravity marked the living face
</p>
<p>was hardened into pulseless outline. No corpse in the
</p>
<p>world was better prejDared according to appearances. The
</p>
<p>white satin around it reflected sufficient light upon the
</p>
<p>face to show us that death was really there; but there
</p>
<p>were sweet roses and early magnolias, and the balmiest of
</p>
<p>lillies strewn around, as if the flowers had begun to bloom
</p>
<p>even upon his coffin. There was then no blood in
</p>
<p>the body; it was drained by the jugular vein and saci'edly
</p>
<p>preserved, and through a cutting on the inside of the thigh
</p>
<p>the empty blood vessels were charged with a chemical
</p>
<p>preparation which hardened to the consistence of stone.
</p>
<p>The long and bony body was hard and stiff, so that it
</p>
<p>could not be moved any more than the arms or legs of a

</p>
<p>Close by the corpse sat the relatives of tte deceased;
</p>
<p>plain, honest, hardy people, typical as much of the simplic-
</p>
<p>ity of our institutions as of Mr. Lincoln's self-made emi-
</p>
<p>nence. No blood relations of Mr. Lincoln were to be
</p>
<p>found. It is a singular evidence of the poverty of his
</p>
<p>origin, and therefore of his exceeding good report, that,
</p>
<p>excepting his immediate family, none answei-ing to his name
</p>
<p>could be discovered. Mrs. Lincoln's relatives, ' however,
</p>
<p>were present in some force. Dr. Lyman Beecher Todd,
</p>
<p>General John B. S. Todd, C. M. Smith, Esq., and Mr. N.
</p>
<p>"W. Edwards, tlie late President's brother-in-law. Plain,
</p>
<p>self-made people were here and were sincerely affected.
</p>
<p>Captain Eobert Lincoln sat during the services with his face
</p>
<p>in his handkei'chief weeping quietly, and little Thad, his
</p>
<p>face red and heated, cried as if his heart would break.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Lincoln, weak, worn and nervous, did not enter the
</p>
<p>east room nor follow the remains. She was the chief mag-
</p>
<p>istrate's wife the day before ; then a widow bearing only
</p>
<p>an immortal name. Among the neighbors of the late Pres-
</p>
<p>ident, who came from afar to pay resj)ect to his remains,
</p>
<p>was one old gentleman from Richmond. He had been hot in
</p>
<p>wrangle upon the boat with some officers who advised the
</p>
<p>execution of all rebel leaders. This the old man opposed,
</p>
<p>when the feeling against him became so intense that he
</p>
<p>was compelled to retire. He counselled mei'cy, good faith
</p>
<p>and forgiveness. That day the men who had called him
</p>
<p>a traitor, saw him among the family mourners, bent with
</p>
<p>grief. All these were waiting in solemn lines, standing

<p>But the first accession of force was that of the clergy,
</p>
<p>sixty in number. They were devout looking men, darkly
</p>
<p>attired, coming from all the neighboring cities to repre-
</p>
<p>sent every denomination. Five years ago these were wrang-
</p>
<p>ling over slavery as a theological question, and at the be-
</p>
<p>ginning of the war it was hard, in many of their bodies,
</p>
<p>to carry loyal resolutions. Then there were there such
</p>
<p>sincere mourners, as Eobert Pattison, of the Methodist
</p>
<p>church, who passed much of his life among slaves and
</p>
<p>masters. He and the rest had come to believe that the
</p>
<p>President was wise and right, and follow him to his grave,
</p>
<p>as the apostles did the interred on calvary. All these retired
</p>
<p>to the south end of the room, facing the feet of the
</p>
<p>corpse, and stood there silently waiting for the coming of
</p>
<p>others. Very soon this east room was filled with the rep-
</p>
<p>resentative intelligence of the entire nation. The governors

<p>of States stood on the dais next to the head of the cof-

<p>fin, with the various features of Curtin, Brough, Fenton,

<p>Stone, Oglesby and Ingi-aham. Behind them were the

<p>Mayors and Councilmen of many towns paying their last
</p>
<p>respects to the representative of the source of all munici-

<p>pal freedom. To their left were the corporate oflScers of

<p>Washington.
</p>
<p>Still further down the steps and closer to the catafalque
</p>
<p>rested the manly features of Augur, whose blood has trick-
</p>
<p>led forth upon the field of battle ; the open, almost beard-
</p>
<p>less contour of Halleck, who has often talked of sieges

<p>and campaigns with that homely gentleman who was going

<p>upon the beflowered carpet was Ulysses Grant, who has
</p>
<p>lived a century in the previous three weeks, and came
</p>
<p>that day to add the lustre of his iron face to that thrill-
</p>
<p>ing and saddened picture. He wore white gloves and
</p>
<p>sash, and was swarthy, nervous and almost tearful, his feet
</p>
<p>crossed, his square, receding head turning now here, now
</p>
<p>there, his treble constellation blazing upon the left shoul-
</p>
<p>der only, but hidden on the right, and one could read
</p>
<p>upon his compact features the indurate and obstinate will
</p>
<p>to fight, on the line he has selected, the honor of tha
</p>
<p>country through any peril, as if he had sworn it by the
</p>
<p>slain man's bier, his state-fellow, patron and friend. Here
</p>
<p>also was the thin haired, conical head of Farragut, close
</p>
<p>by General Grant, with many naval heroes close behind,
</p>
<p>storm beaten, and every inch Americans in thought and
</p>
<p>physiognomy.
</p>
<p>But nearer down, and just opposite the catafalque, so that
</p>
<p>it was perpendicular to the direction of vision, stood the cen-
</p>
<p>tral powers of our Government  its President and counsellors.
</p>
<p>President Johnson facing the middle of the coffin, upon the
</p>
<p>lowest step. His hands were crossed upon his breast, his
</p>
<p>dark clothing just revealing his plaited shirt, and upon his
</p>
<p>full, plethoric, shaven face, broad and severely compact, two
</p>
<p>telling grey eyes rested under a thoughtful brow, whose turn-
</p>
<p>ing hair is straight and smooth. Beside him were Vice-Pres-
</p>

<p>any spectator, and dividing with Charles Sumner, who was

<p>The opening prayer was made by Bishop Simpson, Metho-

<p>had called for his wrath to descend upon us as individuals,

<p>this sad bereavement which has caused a wide spread gloom
</p>
<p>not only in this circle but over the entire land, an invoca-
</p>
<p>tion was made that all might submit to God's holy will.
</p>
<p>Thanks were returned for the gift of such a man as our
</p>
<p>Heavenly Father had just taken from us, and for th^ many
</p>
<p>virtues which distinguished all his transactions ; for the in-
</p>
<p>tegrity, honesty and transparency of character bestowed upon
</p>
<p>him, and for having given him counselors to guide our na-
</p>
<p>tion through periods of unprecedent sorrow. He was per-
</p>
<p>mitted to live to behold the breaking of the clouds which
</p>
<p>overhung our national sky, and the disentegration of the
</p>
<p>Rebellion. Going up the mount he beheld the land of
</p>
<p>promise, with its beauty and happiness and the glorious
</p>
<p>destiny reserved for us as a nation. Thanks were also re-
</p>
<p>turned that his arm was strengthened and wisdom and
</p>
<p>firmness given to his heart to pen a declaration of Eman-
</p>
<p>cipation, by which were broken the chains of millions of
</p>
<p>the human race. God be thanked that the assassin who
</p>
<p>struck down the Chief Magistrate had not the hand to

<p>again bind the suffering and oppressed. The name of the

<p>beloved dead would ever be identified with all that is

<p>great and glorious with humanity on earth. God grant
</p>
<p>that all who stand here intrusted with the administration

<p>of public affairs, may have the power, strength and wisdom
</p>
<p>to complete the jvork of his servant so gloriously begun ;

<p>and may the successor of the deceased President not bear

<p>which caused the Eebellion, be driven from our land,

<p>God grant that the sun may shine on a free people, from

<p>us hearts to deal justly with them, and give them hearts
</p>
<p>to deal justly with us, so that universal peace may reign

<p>on earth. We raise our hearts to Thee to plead that Thy
</p>
<p>blessing may descend on the family of the deceased. God
</p>
<p>bless the weeping widow in her broken-heartedness ; she
</p>
<p>bows under a sad stroke, more than she can bear. En-
</p>
<p>circle her in thine own arms. God be graciously with the

<p>children left behind him. Endow his sons with wisdom.

<p>From on high endow them with great usefulness. May

<p>they appreciate the patriotic example and virtues of their

<p>Father, and walk in his footsteps. We pray Thee, the

<p>to our hearts, while by the remains of the deceased, whom

<p>we had called a friend. Do Thou grant us grace and re-

<p>be gathered where assassins are not found, where sorrow

<p>and sickness never come, but all gather in peace and love

<p>around the Father's throne and glory. We pray Thee
</p>
<p>that our Kepublic may be made the stronger for this

<p>blow, while here we pledge ourselves to set our faces as a

</p>
<p>DR. GUR LEY'S SERMON.
</p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. Gurley Presbyterian, and the President's own
</p>
<p>pastor, then delivered a sermon, standing on the step near
</p>
<p>the head of the coffin. He commenced by saying, we recog-
</p>
<p>nize and adore the sovereignty of Almighty God.  His throne
</p>
<p>is in the Heavens, and His Kingdom ruleth over all. It
</p>
<p>was a cruel hand  the dark hand of the assassin  thai
</p>
<p>smote our honored, wise and noble President, and filled th*
</p>
<p>land with mourning. But above this hand there is anothet
</p>
<p>which we must see and acknowledge. It is the chastening
</p>
<p>hand of a wise and faithful God. He gives us the bittei
</p>
<p>cup. We yield to the behest and drink the draught. Thia
</p>
<p>chastisement comes in a way heavy and mysteriously deep
</p>
<p>at a time when the Rebellion is passing away. The occa.
</p>
<p>sion has stricken down a man upon whom the people had
</p>
<p>learned to trust and upon whom, more than any other, they
</p>
<p>had centered their hopes for a restoration of union and re-
</p>
<p>turn of harmony. In the midst of our rejoicing we needed
</p>
<p>this stroke, this discipline, and therefore God has sent it.
</p>
<p>Our affliction has not come forth from the dust nor from
</p>
<p>the ground. Beyond the act of assassinatipn let us look to
</p>
<p>God, whose prerogative is to bring light out of darkness and
</p>
<p>good out of evil. He who has led us so well and prosper-
</p>
<p>ed us so wonderfully during the last four years of anxiety
</p>
<p>and conflict, will not forsake us now. He may chasten but
</p>
<p>will not destroy. He may purify us in the furnace, but will
</p>
<p>not consume us. Let our principle anxiety now be that this
</p>
<p>new sorrow may be a sanctified sorrow, and induce us to
</p>
<p>give all we have to the cause of truth, justice, law, order,

</p>
<p>OP ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 101
</p>
<p>Thougli weeping may endure for a night, joy cometh in the
</p>
<p>morning. Thank God that in spite of this temporary dark
</p>
<p>ness the morning* has began to dawn, the morning of a
</p>
<p>brighter day than our country has ever before seen. That
</p>
<p>day will come, and the death of a hundred Presidents and
</p>
<p>Cabinets cannot prevent it. The people confided in the late
</p>
<p>lamented President with a firm, and loving confidence which
</p>
<p>no other man has enjoyed since the days of Washington.
</p>
<p>He deserved it well, and deserved it all. He merited it by
</p>
<p>his character, by his acts, and by the whole tenor and tone
</p>
<p>and spirit of his life. He was wise, simple, sincere, plain
</p>
<p>and honest, truthful and just, benevolent and kind. His per-
</p>
<p>ceptions were quick and clear, his judgment was calm and
</p>
<p>accurate, and his purposes were good and pure. Beyond a
</p>
<p>question, always and everywhere, he aimed and endeavored
</p>
<p>to be right and to do right. His integrity was all prevad-
</p>
<p>ing, all controlling, and incorruptible. He gave his personal
</p>
<p>consideration to all matters, whether great or small. How
</p>
<p>firmly and well he occupied his post and met its grave de-
</p>
<p>mands in seasons of trial and difiiculty is known to you all,
</p>
<p>to the country and the world. He comprehended all the en-
</p>
<p>ormity of treason and rose to the full dignity of the occa-
</p>
<p>sion. He saw his duty as Chief Magistrate of a great and
</p>
<p>imperiled people, and leaned on the arm of Him who giveth
</p>
<p>power to the faint, and who increaseth strength. The Rev.
</p>
<p>Dr. Gurley, toward the close of his address said : I speak
</p>
<p>what I know, and testify what I have often heard him say,
</p>
<p>when I affirm that guidance and mercy were the prop on
</p>
<p>which he humbly and habitually leaned ; that they were tht

<p>best hope he had for himself and his country. Hence,
</p>
<p>102 LIFE AND JIAKTTRDOM
</p>
<p>when lie was leaving his home in Illinois, arid coming tc
</p>
<p>the city to take his seat in the Executive chair of a dis-
</p>
<p>turbed and troubled nation, he said to the old and tried
</p>
<p>friends who gathered tearfully around him, and bade him
</p>
<p>farewell : "I leave with this request, pray for me." They
</p>
<p>did pray for him, and millions of others prayed, nor did
</p>
<p>they pray in vain. Their prayer was heard, and the an-
</p>
<p>swer appears in all his subsequent history. It shines forti
</p>
<p>with heavenly radience in the whole course and tenor of hia
</p>
<p>administration, from its commencement to its close. God
</p>
<p>raised him up for a great and glorious mission, flirnishej
</p>
<p>him for his work and aided him in its accomplishment.
</p>
<p>Nor was it merely by strength of mind and honesty of
</p>
<p>heart, and purity and pertinacity of purpose that he furnish,
</p>
<p>ed him. In addition to these things he gave him a calm
</p>
<p>and abiding confidence in the over-ruling Providence of God,
</p>
<p>and in the ultimate triumph of truth and righteousness.
</p>
<p>Through the power and blessing of God this confidence
</p>
<p>strengthened him in all his hours of anxiety and toil, and
</p>
<p>inspired him with calm and cheering hope, when others were
</p>
<p>inclined to despondency and gloom. Never shall I forget the
</p>
<p>emphasis and the deep emotion with which he said, in this
</p>
<p>very room, to a company of clergymen and others who call-
</p>
<p>ed to pay him their respects, in the darkest days of our
</p>
<p>civil conflict :
</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, my hope of success in this great and terrible struggle,
</p>
<p>rests on that immutable foundation  the justice and goodness of God;
</p>
<p>and "when events are very threatening and prospects very dark, I still
</p>
<p>hope that in some way, which man cannot see, all will be well in tha
</p>
<p>end, because our cause is just, and God is on our side."

<p>adherance to a policy of administration which he thought,
</p>
<p>and which we all now think, both God and humanity re-
</p>
<p>quired him to adopt. "We admired and loved him on many

<p>accounts, for strong and various reasons. We admired his

<p>childlike simplicity, his freedom from guile and deceit,
</p>
<p>his staunch and sterling integrity, his kind and forgiving

<p>temper, his industry and patience, his persistent, self-sacrific-

<p>the least to the greatest, his readiness to hear and con-

<p>friends of the Union, leading them away from abstractions

<p>and inducing them to work together and harmoniously for

<p>the public weal ; his true and enlarged philanthrophy that

<p>wide spreading 'as the earth, and as enduring as the sun ;
</p>
<p>all these things commanded and T&xed our admiration and
</p>
<p>tlie admiration of the world, and stamped upon his charac-
</p>
<p>ter and life the unmistakable impress of greatness. But
</p>
<p>more sublime than any or all of these, more holy and
</p>
<p>influential, more beautiful and strong and sustaining was his
</p>
<p>abiding confidence in God and the final triumph of truth
</p>
<p>and righteousness through him and for his sake. This was
</p>
<p>his noblest vii-tue, his grandest principle, the secret alike
</p>
<p>of his strength, his patience and his success. And this,
</p>
<p>it seems to me, after being near him steadily and with
</p>
<p>him often for more than four years, is the principle by
</p>
<p>which more than by any other ' he being dead yet speak-
</p>
<p>eth." Yes by his steady, enduring confidence in God and
</p>
<p>in the complete ultimate triumph of the cause of God,
</p>
<p>which is the cause of humanity, more than in any other
</p>
<p>way, does he now speak to us, and to the nation he loved
</p>
<p>and served so well. By this he < speaks to his successor

<p>in office, and charges him to have faith in God ; by this
</p>
<p>he speaks to the members of his Cabinet, the men with
</p>
<p>whom he counselled so often and was associated with so

<p>he speaks to all who occupy positions of influence and au-

<p>great people as they sit in sack-cloth to-day, and weep for

<p>that the voice of this testimony may sink down into our

</p>
<p>now dearer to us than ever before, because consecrated by
</p>
<p>the blood of its most conspicuous defender, its wisest and
</p>
<p>most fondly trusted friend. He is dead, but the God in
</p>
<p>whom he trusted lives, and He can guide and strengthen
</p>
<p>his successor, as He guided and strengthened him. He is
</p>
<p>dead, but tlie memory of his virtues, of his wise and

<p>patriotic councils, and the labors of his calm and steady
</p>
<p>faith in God live, is precious, and will be a power for
</p>
<p>good in the country down to- the end of time. He is
</p>
<p>dead, but the cause he so ardently loved, so ably, patient-
</p>
<p>ly, faithfully represented and defended, not for himselt
</p>
<p>only, not for us only, but for all people in all their com-
</p>
<p>ing generations, till time shall be no more  that cause
</p>
<p>survives his fall, and will survive it. The light of its

<p>The gloom occasioned by his death, and the language of

<p>This is our confidence, and this is our consolation as we

</p>
<p>God be praised that our fallen chief lived long enough to

<p>see the day dawn, and the day-star of joy and j^eace arise
</p>
<p>upon the nation. He saw it and he was glad. Alas ! alas I

<p>He only saw the dawn. When the sun has risen, full-orbea

</p>

<p>will be a precious and a consecrated spot. The friends of

<p>Liberty and the Union will repair to it in years and ages

<p>to come, to pronounce the memory of its occupant blessed,

<p>the guilty perpetrators of this horrible crime be arrested and
</p>
<p>brought to justice. O, hear the cry and the prayer, and the
</p>
<p>wail rising from the nation's smitten and crushed heart, and
</p>
<p>deliver us from the power of our enemy, and send speedy
</p>
<p>peace into all our borders, through Jesus Christ, our Lord,
</p>
<p>Amen."
</p>
<p>The corpse was then removed to the hearse which was in
</p>
<p>front of the Executive Mansion, and at two o'clock the pro-
</p>
<p>cession was formed. It took the line of Pennsylvania avenue.
</p>
<p>The streets were kept clear of all encumbrances ; but the
</p>
<p>eide-walks were densely lined with people from the "White
</p>
<p>House to the Capitol, a distance of a mile and a half. The
</p>
<p>roofs, porticos and windows, and all elevated points were oc-
</p>
<p>cupied by interested spectators. As the procession started,
</p>
<p>minute guns were fired near St. John's Church, the City
</p>
<p>Hall and the Capitol. The bells of all the Churches in the
</p>
<p>city and of the various engine houses were tolled.
</p>
<p>First in the order of procession was a detachment of col-
</p>
<p>ored troops ; then followed white regiments of infantry, and
</p>
<p>bodies of artillery and cavalry, navy, marine and army of-
</p>
<p>ficers on foot; the pall-bearers in carriages next; the hearse
</p>
<p>drawn by six white horses, the coffin prominent to every be-
</p>
<p>holder. The floor on which it rested was strewn with ever-
</p>
<p>greens, and the coffin covered with white flowers. Then fol-
</p>
<p>lowed the President and Cabinet, the diplomatic corps, mem-
</p>
<p>bers of Congress, Governors of States, the delegations from
</p>
<p>various States, fire companies, civic associations, the clerks of

<p>The nearest relatives of the late President's family there
</p>
<p>were the two sons of the deceased, namely: Captain Robert
</p>
<p>and Thaddeus Lincoln, N. W. Edwards and C. M. Smith, of

<p>Springfield, brothers-in-law of the late President, and Dr.
</p>
<p>Lyman B. Todd, of Lexington, Ky., and General and J. B.
</p>
<p>Todd, of Dakota, cousins of Mrs. Lincoln.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Lincoln was not present at the funeral. It was said
</p>
<p>she had not even seen her husband's corpse since the morn
</p>
<p>ing of his death.
</p>
<p>After the President's remains was placed on the catafalque,
</p>
<p>in the rotunda of the Capitol, Major General Meigs, Quar-

</p>
<p>A detachment of the Twenty-fourth regiment Veteran Re-
</p>
<p>serves did guard duty at the entrance of the rotunda and
</p>
<p>at the gates of the Capitol.
</p>
<p>As soon as the doors were thrown open on the morning
</p>
<p>of the 20th, the throng of visitors began to press forward.
</p>
<p>All were required to enter at the main eastern entrance, and
</p>
<p>passing in two lines on either side of the catafalque, to go
</p>
<p>to the western door of the rotunda. None were permitted
</p>
<p>to linger. A strong guard was placed across the lower
</p>
<p>steps of the eastern entrance, and a line of guards in close
</p>
<p>order on either side, marked the avenue left for the people
</p>
<p>who desired to pass in. About ten o'clock a heavy rain
</p>
<p>storm partially checked the crowd : but, notwithstanding the
</p>
<p>rain, the long and ceaseless procession of saddened faces
</p>
<p>came pressing forward at the rate of three thousand persons
</p>
<p>per hour.
</p>
<p>The catafalque was better arranged to afford a view of the
</p>
<p>features of the honored dead than the one at the White
</p>
<p>House. The features were little changed, and by many are
</p>
<p>said to look more natural than when they lay in state at
</p>
<p>the White House.
</p>
<p>The whole force of the Capitol Police, under the direction
</p>
<p>of Captain Newman, clad in mourning habiliments, were on
</p>
<p>duty preserving order, and politely, but in suppressed tones,
</p>
<p>and almost noiseless steps, directing the movemen's of the
</p>
<p>crowd.
</p>
<p>The rotunda, which was lighted by only a sort of twi-
</p>
<p>light hue, was filled with solemn stillness, unbroken save by
</p>
<p>the rustling of the dresses of the female mourners, and oc-
</p>
<p>asionally a deep sigh from some of those passing the coffin,

<p>110 LIFE AND MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>THE REMAINS OF THE PRESIDENT EXROUTE FROM
</p>
<p>WASHINGTON.
</p>
<p>At 6 o'clock Friday Morning, April 21, the members of
</p>
<p>the Cabinet and many distinguished individuals met at the
</p>
<p>Kotunda to pay their last respects to tlie late Chief Magis-
</p>
<p>trate. The Rev. Dr. Gurley offered up a fervent prayer,
</p>
<p>and at 7:-40 the body was placed in a hearse, and followed
</p>
<p>to the depot by Lieut.-Gen. Grant and Staff, and Maj. B.
</p>
<p>B. French. Then came the Cabinet, consisting of Secretar-
</p>
<p>ies Stanton, Welles and Usher, Postmaster-General Dennison
</p>
<p>^nd Attorney-General Speed. The carriage of President
</p>
<p>Johnson following the carriage of Lieut.-Gen. Grant. On
</p>
<p>arriving at the depot, the coffin was placed in the car assigned.
</p>
<p>At precisely eight o'clock the train started, all standing with
</p>
<p>uncovered heads until the train passed out of view. The
</p>
<p>remains of little Willie Lincoln, who died in Washington Feb-
</p>
<p>ruary, 1862, accompany those of his father.
</p>

</p>
<p>The funeral cortege arrived at the Cowden Station of the
</p>
<p>JBaltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, about 10 o'clock.
</p>
<p>Amid the tolling of the city bells and firing of minute guns
</p>
<p>from the forts, a procession composed of the military and
</p>
<p>civic societies, under command of Brigadier General Lock-
</p>
<p>wood was soon formed. Provost Marshal Col. Woolley acting as
</p>
<p>Grand Marshal, and line of march taken to the Exchange, where
</p>
<p>the remains were laid in state in the Rotunda. The catafalque
</p>
<p>was richly draped, and ornamented with silver stars and

<p>fringe. The floor of the dais was bordered with evergieens

<p>and choice flowers. Upward of 10,000 persons viewed the
</p>
<p>OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. Ill
</p>
<p>body, but double that number were denied tlie coveted priv-
</p>
<p>ilege, as when the hour of 2 o'clock, P. M. arrived, the
</p>
<p>coffin was closed and the remains escorted by the military
</p>
<p>to the depot of the Northern Central Kailroad. At a few
</p>
<p>minutes past 3 o'clock the funeral train was wending its way
</p>
<p>to Ilarrisburg, Pa.
</p>
<p>Upon reaching the State line at 5J o'clock, it was found
</p>
<p>that Gov. Curtin had arrived from Ilarrisburg in a special
</p>
<p>train, accompanied by his Staff. The greetings of the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernors of Pennsylvania and Maryland, was exceedingly cordial.
</p>
<p>At various places along the road the national banner was
</p>
<p>displayed, either festooned with crape or bearing a black
</p>
<p>border. The same solemnity of countenance was everywhere seen,
</p>
<p>and all seemed to be profoundly mournful spectators of the burial
</p>
<p>cortege. At York the ladies asked permission to lay on
</p>
<p>the coffin a wreath of flowers. The hand of affection could
</p>
<p>not have contributed a more choice and delicate tribute to
</p>
<p>departed worth.

<p>HARRISBURG.
</p>
<p>The funeral train reached Ilarrisburg at 8J o'clock, Friday
</p>
<p>Evening. It was heavily raining; but notwithstanding this
</p>
<p>the streets were densely thronged, and a large military escort
</p>
<p>accompanied the remains of the President, to the State House,
</p>
<p>amid the sound of minute guns, where the corpse was exposed
</p>
<p>to the view of the public until a late hour.
</p>
<p>The train left for Philadelphia at 11 o'clock Saturday
</p>
<p>Mornino-. Thousands of persons were sad witnesses of its
</p>
<p>departure. The patriotic daughters laid a wreath of flowers
</p>
<p>on the President's coffin. The cars in quick succession passed

<p>country houses, workshops and settlements, every resident
</p>
<p>appearing to witness the passing train. Battle flags were
</p>
<p>displayed everywhere, banners were at half mast, badges
</p>
<p>of black were universal, and all elevated points, balconies
</p>
<p>windows, housetops, &e., were occupied by persons of both
</p>
<p>sexes and all conditions, each countenance bespeaking a sad
</p>
<p>heart.

<p>PHILADELPHIA.
</p>
<p>The train arrived at the Broad Street Station at precisely
</p>
<p>half-past four o'clock, on Saturday afternoon, or two hours
</p>
<p>earlier than the schedule of time originally announced, in
</p>
<p>order to afford more daylight for the display. The military
</p>
<p>both white and black made a fine display. The city troop
</p>
<p>acted as body guard. In the procession were the Mayor,
</p>
<p>the City Councils, and other municipal authorities, Federal
</p>
<p>officers, army and navy ofl3.cers stationed in the city and
</p>
<p>neighborhood, the Judiciary, members of the Legislature,
</p>
<p>members of Congress, representatives of Foreign Courts, and
</p>
<p>numerous others of distinction. The firemen and every society,
</p>
<p>institute and organization were well represented, especially the
</p>
<p>the Knights Templars, the Odd Fellows, and the Fenians.
</p>
<p>Many colored men also appeared as members of charitable
</p>
<p>and other societies, with appropriate badges and regalia. The
</p>
<p>chimes of St. Peter's and Christ Churches (Episcopal) were
</p>
<p>responded to by St. Mary's (Roman Catholic) Church. The
</p>
<p>procession occupied an hour and a half in passing the streets
</p>
<p>designated in the programme, when the Old State House
</p>
<p>having been reached, the corpse was taken into Independence

<p>Hall, where it was placed near the bell which first proclaimed
</p>
<p>OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 113
</p>
<p>the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. The Hah
</p>
<p>was clothed in such a manner as became the occasion, ren-
</p>
<p>dering the entire scene solemnly imposing. The houses were
</p>
<p>draped with mou;-ning. Ingenuity was exhausted in showing
</p>
<p>to the best advantage this exterior manifestation of grief.
</p>
<p>The body of the President was visited by thousands during
</p>
<p>the night on invitation tickets from the Select Councils.
</p>
<p>Before day light lines were formed east and west of Inde-
</p>
<p>pendence Hall, passing in by two stairways through the front
</p>
<p>windows, and out by the rear into the Square. By 10 o'-
</p>
<p>clock these lines extended at least three miles, from the
</p>
<p>Delaware to the Schuylkill Riter, thousands occupying three
</p>
<p>or four hours before accomplishing their object of seeing the
</p>
<p>remains. Great numbers of women took position in the line,
</p>
<p>and notwithstanding the fatigue of slow progress, effected their
</p>
<p>object. Many, only giving up when they fainted, were car-
</p>
<p>ried off by their friends. The scenes at the hall were im-
</p>
<p>pressively solemn, and not a few persons were affected to
</p>
<p>tears. An old colored woman, 65 or 70 years of age, thrilled
</p>
<p>the spectators with her open expressions of grief. Gazing tor
</p>
<p>a few moments on the face of the dead, she exclaimed, clasp-
</p>
<p>ino- her hands, while tears coursed down her withered cheeks:
</p>
<p>"Oh, Abraham Lincoln ! Oh, he is dead ! he is dead ! " The
</p>
<p>sympathy and love expressed by this poor woman found a
</p>
<p>response in every heart, and seemed to increase, if possible,
</p>
<p>the general grief. It was not until long after midnight that
</p>
<p>the coffin-lid was replaced, and the face thus forever hid
</p>
<p>from the afflicted citizens. The Pbiladelphians did everything
</p>
<p>possible to show their respect for the distinguished deceased.

</p>
<p>The countenances of the people best express the sadness of
</p>
<p>114 lib's and martyrdom
</p>
<p>their hearts. The good taste of the citizens of Philadelphia
</p>
<p>was displayed iu the mourning habiliments of their dwellings
</p>
<p>and places of business. The ladies appeared with moui'uing
</p>
<p>badges on their left shoulders, and this custom was so gen-
</p>
<p>eral that its non-observance was noticed.
</p>
<p>The funeral train left at 4 o'clock Monday morning for
</p>
<p>New York.
</p>
<p>JERSEY CITY.
</p>
<p>At 10 o'clock on Monday the vast crowds, which had
</p>
<p>gathered in front of the depot gates, were observed to surge
</p>
<p>from side to side, and immediately afterward the train moved
</p>
<p>slowly into the depot. It consisted of nine handsome cars.
</p>
<p>The car containing the coffin was large and roomy, black
</p>
<p>paneled, the upper portion festooned with black merino, looped
</p>
<p>with silver cords, with silver tassels drooping below, the
</p>
<p>whole surmounted with solemn rows of sable plumes. All
</p>
<p>heads were uncovered as the train moved in, and a most
</p>
<p>impressive silence prevailed throughout the vast multitude.
</p>
<p>While the train moved in, and for several moments afterward,
</p>
<p>while the remains were being borne from the boat the Ger-
</p>
<p>man singers, of whom we have already spoken, raised their
</p>
<p>grand and solemn requiem for the dead, until the vaulted
</p>
<p>roof of the great structure resounded to the impressive strains.
</p>
<p>In the interval, the crowds in the galleries remained perfectly
</p>
<p>hushed, and that grand song alone rose and fell, and swelled
</p>
<p>and wavered among them, like the lament of a mourning
</p>
<p>world.
</p>
<p>The coffin inclosing the remains was slowly and carefully
</p>
<p>removed from the car and placed upon the stalwart shoulders

<p>of the guard which had accompanied it from Washington  a
</p>
<p>OFABRAHAM LINCOLN. 115
</p>
<p>detachment of the Veteran Reserve Corps. The preliminary
</p>
<p>procession was then formed, and proceeded to the boat.
</p>
<p>As the imposing procession moved through the densely
</p>
<p>crowded depot to the still more crowded street, and thence
</p>
<p>into the depot again, there was a most remarkable silence
</p>
<p>everywhere. The roofs of the buildings and the tops of cars
</p>
<p>in the company's yards were crowded to suffocation ; the crowds
</p>
<p>in the streets were immense, and the same deeply respectful
</p>
<p>silence, the same breathless suspense prevailed throughout.
</p>
<p>Not the least touching feature in this display was that ex-
</p>
<p>hibited by the negroes, of whom there were a large number
</p>
<p>in the crowd. Upon their dusky faces could be seen the
</p>
<p>traces of grief, which sprang from instinct rather than from
</p>
<p>reason, a profound reverence which was worthy of the study
</p>
<p>of scholars learned in study of character, and of cause and
</p>
<p>and effect.
</p>
<p>The hearse was a very handsome one,  a frame-work of
</p>
<p>glass, black paneled, inlaid with silver beads, with four nod-
</p>
<p>ding plumes of sable on either side. It was drawn by six
</p>
<p>handsome gray horses. The caparisons and everything con-
</p>
<p>nected with the hearse were simple, but appropriate and
</p>
<p>beautiful. After depositing their precious burden therein, the
</p>
<p>Guard of Honor marched as special guard to the remains,
</p>
<p>seven on each side  while the remainder of the cortege fol-
</p>
<p>lowed in due order.
</p>
<p>The ferry boat New York, which was waiting to receive
</p>
<p>the procession, was appropriately decorated with flags and sym-
</p>
<p>bols of mourning. The bridge leading to the ferry was also
</p>
<p>handsomely decorated with flags and steamers, and the inevi-

</p>
<p>After a short delay, the whole party were embarked, and
</p>
<p>the powerful steamer moved across the river with hardly any
</p>
<p>perceptible vibration, as if it were a thing of life and con-
</p>
<p>scious of the precious nature of its charge. The requiem
</p>
<p>singers continued their solemn chorus. From far down the
</p>
<p>Bay came the echoes of the distant cannon, and nearer still
</p>
<p>they rang and reverberatad over the boat. Guns boomed,
</p>
<p>the requiem rose and fell, vessels in the harbor dipped their
</p>
<p>flags in token of respect, and the hum of the peopled piers
</p>
<p>awaiting to receive their dead chieftain could be heard long
</p>
<p>before the vessel touched the landing.
</p>
<p>NEW YORK.
</p>
<p>The scenes at the foot of Desbrosses street was one never
</p>
<p>to be forgotten. Every foot of ground, eyery attainable perch,
</p>
<p>every house-roof was black, with human forms. Men and boys
</p>
<p>were perched on trees and telegraph poles ; house-tops were
</p>
<p>so covered with spectators that it was a wonder that they
</p>
<p>did not fall in, and every window appeared to contain a
</p>
<p>dozen heads of eager spectators. But a strong force of po-
</p>
<p>lice was on hand, and the best of order prevailed. Up the
</p>
<p>long open space, which stretched from the gates of the ferry-
</p>
<p>bridge, could be seen a clear, broad lane, awaiting the fu-
</p>
<p>neral cortege. The left hand hedge was the splendid front
</p>
<p>of our own 7th Regiment, as regularly formed as a line of
</p>
<p>palisades, the long line of policemen, on the right, present-
</p>
<p>ing a no less creditable appearance. The arrangements had
</p>
<p>been perfected with singular judgment, and the excellent order
</p>
<p>which was everywhere preserved, notwithstanding the enor-

</p>
<p>mous crowd, reflected great credit upon the police authorities.
</p>
<p>OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. Ill
</p>
<p>Indeed, we did not witness, in the entire march, a single
</p>
<p>disturbance of a serious character. The equanimity of the
</p>
<p>crowd, as a general thing, appeared to be equal to their re-
</p>
<p>spect for the departed President.
</p>
<p>But little time was lost iu preparations for the march to
</p>
<p>the City Hall. The hearse was first drawn out, the Seventh
</p>
<p>Regiment forming round it in hollow square. Four battalions
</p>
<p>of policemen, in excellent oi'der followed, and the remainder
</p>
<p>of the procession came after in the same order we have al-
</p>
<p>ready mentioned. A portion of the Washington delegation,
</p>
<p>however  that comprising the General officers  making the re-
</p>
<p>mainder of tlie march in coaches. Four policemen followed,
</p>
<p>and the remainder of the procession followed in the order
</p>
<p>we give above.
</p>
<p>The appearance of the sidewalks and houses, as the pro-
</p>
<p>cession moved up Desbrosses street, to the dull beat of the
</p>
<p>dead march from the band in the van, was most impressive.
</p>
<p>Every window was full of heads, every house was covered
</p>
<p>with mourning, and the people on the sidewalks formed a
</p>
<p>solid, scarcely breathing wall.
</p>
<p>Turning slowly up Desbrosses street, to Canal street, and
</p>
<p>thence eastward, the solemn procession swung down Broadway,
</p>
<p>to the same funeral step, the dense crowds gathering denser
</p>
<p>as they moved, while the most impressive silence prevailed.
</p>

<p>Every available post was occupied. Enthusiastic boys fixed
</p>
<p>118 LIFE AND MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>themselves on railings, lamp-posts, &c., while in the Park
</p>
<p>many were perched on boughs and branches of the trees to
</p>
<p>the manifest peril of life and limb. The most perfect silence
</p>
<p>was observed, save at times, when a murmur of whispered
</p>
<p>grief, like the sound of distant waters, was borne on the air.
</p>
<p>Heads were uncovered, and tearful eyes turned heavenward
</p>
<p>as the remains of the martyred patriot  a nation's idol  wore
</p>
<p>borne past. The Astor House was one mass of life, while
</p>
<p>the dark decorations of mourning waved sadly and sullenly
</p>
<p>from basement to roof. As the procession wheeled around
</p>
<p>the lower end of the Park the utmost eflForts of a large and
</p>
<p>efficient force of police could not keep the crowd back. For
</p>
<p>a few moments the procession was broken, and outsiders had
</p>
<p>an opportunity of pushing onward to the City Hall to get a
</p>
<p>glimpse of the departed. Many were the congratulations on
</p>
<p>this point.
</p>
<p>Anxious eyes looked out from the windows in the vicini-
</p>
<p>ty, while the crowd surged to and fro beneath. Earely have
</p>
<p>scenes like this been witnessed. Death is at all times im-
</p>
<p>pressive, but under circumstances like these the feeling is too
</p>
<p>intensified for language to express it. The windows of French's
</p>
<p>Hotel were, like all others, full of anxious, eager, pallid
</p>
<p>faces. Moistened eyes rested on the funeral car which bore
</p>
<p>the last precious remains of a people's choice, and as the
</p>
<p>last honors were paid to the great departed a mournful si-
</p>
<p>lence pervaded the vast multitude. Never did the word of
</p>
<p>command, "present arms," fall on the ear with such a choking
</p>
<p>sensation. In the looks of those men thus arrayed there was
</p>
<p>something too deep for language, too overwhelming for out-

</p>
<p>The City Hall is reached. The coffin is removed from the
</p>
<p>heax-se. Slowly and solemnly, with heads bent low, and look
</p>
<p>of profound emotion, while the bright sunshine glimmered on
</p>
<p>brilliant uniform and glittering sword, and waving flags almost
</p>
<p>darkened the air, the coffin is borne onward by fourteen
</p>
<p>orderlies past the military lines of the 7th Regiment N. Y.
</p>
<p>S. N. Gr.; past the veterans of the war of 1812 j past the
</p>
<p>lines of the Metropolitan Police drawn up in hollow square 
</p>
<p>on, still on  up the steps of the City Hall, where one thous-
</p>
<p>and German singers were stationed, whose mournful wail
</p>
<p>floated high above all other sounds, and was re-echoed within
</p>
<p>the dim and solemn chamber of the Hall, and borne onward
</p>
<p>beyond the military lines on the passing breeze to the dis-
</p>
<p>tant, heaving crowd.
</p>
<p>The remains were hardly deposited within the Hall when
</p>
<p>a column of eager applicants for admission was formed, which
</p>
<p>extended away through Chatham street, to nearly the Bowery.
</p>
<p>All races and all colors were represented in it, and we eer-
</p>
<p>taiuly never supposed that there was so much human patience
</p>
<p>in the world.
</p>
<p>The scene in front of the City Hall was very animated.
</p>
<p>The long files of policemen were placed in a line running
</p>
<p>from the east to the west gate of the Park, and also on
</p>
<p>Printing-House square and Park-row.
</p>
<p>In the Governor's room the decorations were beautiful.
</p>
<p>The portraits of the Governors and ex-Mayors of New York
</p>
<p>and the various other celebrities were all draped in the usual

<p>form of mourning. At 11 o'clock about 2,000 members of

</p>
<p>THE PROCESSION.
</p>
<p>Even during all the night before, preliminaries for the
</p>
<p>great funeral procession had been going forward at many
</p>
<p>points in the city. Before dawn the stir increased. Almost
</p>
<p>as soon as it was light, the vast amount of our great met-
</p>
<p>ropolitan population began to move perceptibly toward tho
</p>
<p>Badly magnificent ceremony of the day. At first many sol-
</p>
<p>diers, uniformed and armed, or single civilians, in decent
</p>
<p>black, were gathering to a thousand rendezvous of regiment,
</p>
<p>society, club or association, as to centres of crystallization
</p>
<p>sprinkled over the extensive city map. And while uniform
</p>
<p>and civic costume varied in their respective many ways, two
</p>
<p>universal marks, distinguishable, indeed, in almost every citi-
</p>
<p>zen, whether to be participant or spectator of the sombre
</p>
<p>pageant  the crape badge on the arm, and the countenance
</p>
<p>serious and often sad  silently witnessed that the vast city
</p>
<p>arose in oneness of heart to offer a last testimony of grief
</p>
<p>and love at the death of the liberator, the patriot, the hon-
</p>
<p>est man and the wise ruler.
</p>
<p>The procession formed in eight divisions. The first division
</p>
<p>standing in line for a mile and three-quarters on Broadway
</p>
<p>from the Park to Fourteenth street, could thus be conven-
</p>
<p>iently followed by each of the others in its order, all cross-
</p>
<p>ing the Park and wheeling to the right into Broadway.
</p>
<p>THE SPECTATORS.
</p>
<p>As ihje time of starting approached, a tremendous crowd

</p>
<p>of spectators lined the whole of the appointed route, stand-
</p>
<p>OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 121
</p>
<p>nif often in a dense human hedore twelve or fifteen feet
</p>
<p>deep along the curb-stones. Another almost equally numerous
</p>
<p>body occupied the steps, gratings and inner border of the
</p>
<p>walk ; while all windows were filled with men, women and
</p>
<p>children  occupancy being often sold for money, and adver-
</p>
<p>tised by handbills posted up outside. Thousands and thous-
</p>
<p>ands of these lookers on were too young to know their
</p>
<p>right hands from their left, and were doubtless brought in
</p>
<p>order that, in old age, they might say they saw the funeral'
</p>
<p>procession of Abraham Lincoln. Eaves, roflfs, trees, posts,
</p>
<p>were edged or tipt or fructified with men or women. Along
</p>
<p>the middle of each sidewalk crept in either direction a slug-
</p>
<p>gish, narrow stream of passengers.
</p>
<p>At 1 o'clock, and with prompt good faith the great pro-
</p>
<p>cession moved forward. The right of the first or military
</p>
<p>division resting on Fourteenth street, it was of course at that
</p>
<p>point that actual movement began.
</p>
<p>THE MILITARY DIVISION.
</p>
<p>According to a funeral etiquette, the order of the march
</p>
<p>as well as the position of the soldier's weapon, is reversed,
</p>
<p>and the last instead of the first brigade of a division, regi-
</p>
<p>ment of a brigade, &c., goes first. The Second Division of
</p>
<p>New York State troops precedes the First, the Eleventh Brig-
</p>
<p>ade precedes the Fifth, the Fifty-second Regiment is before
</p>
<p>the Forty-seventh, that before the Twenty-third, and so on.
</p>
<p>Down the whole long line of the great thoroughfare, clear
</p>
<p>to the Park, the regiments were standing at ease, facing
</p>
<p>eastward. One after another, in quick succession, they turned
</p>
<p>into column of sections, and a bird's eye view would show

</p>
<p>the whole distance from Union Park to the City Hall, one
</p>
<p>122 LIFE AND MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>long track of stony gray, bordered with the heavy black
</p>
<p>masses along each sidewalk, and from end to end, trans-
</p>
<p>versly striated with the sections, deliberately gliding north-
</p>
<p>ward in common time, the swords and bayonets sparkling and
</p>
<p>glinting in the perfect sunlight.
</p>
<p>THE FUNERAL CAR.
</p>
<p>The Seventh Regiment acted as guard of honor; and
</p>
<p>within its hollow square, rolling slowly nearer and nearer,
</p>
<p>came the funei^l car, a gloomy and imposing structure, its
</p>
<p>heavy plumes nodding to and fro. Before the guard of honor
</p>
<p>inarched a strong platoon of policemen, sweeping once more
</p>
<p>every inch of the street from curb to curb. There was, how-
</p>
<p>ever, scarcely the least infringement of the orders in this
</p>
<p>matter. Here and there some weary old lady or careless
</p>
<p>boy sat down with feet in the gutter; but the crowd, though
</p>
<p>dense and massed to a degree even far beyond that of the
</p>
<p>remarkable occasion just after Inauguration Day, kept heed-
</p>
<p>fully to the sidewalk.
</p>
<p>THE GUARD OP HONOR,
</p>
<p>the Seventh Regiment, Col. Emmons Clark, came next, with
</p>
<p>reversed arms; its mathematically accurate marching and
</p>
<p>thoroughly soldierlike array justified its employment in this
</p>
<p>melancholy but honorable duty.
</p>
<p>The car itself rolled slowly and gloomily before us. Its
</p>
<p>Bixteen gray horses were shrouded in black, and led each by
</p>
<p>a colored groom. Immediately about it marched the faithful
</p>
<p>squad of soldiers of the Veteran Reserves who accompanied
</p>
<p>the remains from Washington. The car itself consisted of a

<p>broad platform fourteen feet by eight, on which was a stag

</p>
<p>or dais where the coffin lay. O.ver this was a rich canopy
</p>
<p>upon four columns, having planted at the foot of each col-
</p>
<p>umn three national flags festooned and craped. Above the
</p>
<p>four corners of the canopy were four great shadowing and
</p>
<p>waving masses of sable plumes, and at the top was a small
</p>
<p>model of a circular temple, unwalled, open, empty. Thus so
</p>
<p>would teach this little emblem  was the nation, the home of
</p>
<p>freedom, bereft of its representative man. Or, perhips, thus
</p>
<p>empty of its former tenant, w-as the body of the dead the
</p>
<p>temple of life. Within, the car was lined with white satin,
</p>
<p>and above the coffin hangs a large eagle, his wings outspread
</p>
<p>as if he hovered there, and carrying in his talons a wreath
</p>
<p>of laurel. All around the black draperies hung almost to
</p>
<p>the earth. Up on the surface of the dais and platform,
</p>
<p>beautiful white flowers were disposed in graceful, plenteous
</p>
<p>wreaths and boquets, and the deep blackness of the draperies
</p>
<p>is moreover somewhat relieved by festoons and spangles of
</p>
<p>silver bullion.
</p>
<p>THE CIVILIAN PROCESSION.
</p>
<p>The military portion of the processions is thus concluded,
</p>
<p>with a few small exceptions. With similar exceptions, the
</p>
<p>remainder of it, in place of the rich efi"ects of the uniforms,
</p>
<p>the order of march, and the glitter and gleam of weapons,
</p>
<p>presented a monotonous, although impressive, column of civ-
</p>
<p>ilians, in black clothes and hats. In several respects thia
</p>
<p>portion of the procession was to the thoughtful observer
</p>
<p>more significant than the military part ; but it was by virtue
</p>
<p>of implications and associated ideas, not by considerations of

<p>124 LIFE AND MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>NATIONALITIES.
</p>
<p>The numerical strength and watchful nationality of the
</p>
<p>Irish in New York was once more shown by the fact that
</p>
<p>one whole division, the Fifth, consisted entirely of Irish
</p>
<p>associations  and a large division it was. Among them
</p>
<p>marched, as in the Inauguration procession, a number of
</p>
<p>companies of boys, in green blouses, and hand in hand.
</p>
<p>The little fellows looked well and mai'ched finely.
</p>
<p>The athletic German turners, in their plain linen coats,
</p>
<p>looked strong, ready and sensible.
</p>
<p>A long ax'ray of mechanics' protective and provident as-
</p>
<p>sociations constituted the latter part of the civilians' pro-
</p>
<p>cession, a very few among them here and there showing
</p>
<p>disgracefully enough, the influence of liquor.
</p>
<p>The Brooklyn delegation constituted the Eighth Division,
</p>
<p>and after it, bringing up the rear, with a strong double
</p>
<p>rank of policemen before and behind, came a body of
</p>
<p>about two hundred colored men. Part of them were freed-
</p>
<p>men recently from slavery, and these bore a banner with
</p>
<p>two inscriptions : "Abraham Lincoln our Emancipator," and
</p>
<p>" To Millions of Freemen he Liberty gave." This was the
</p>
<p>only portion of the procession which was received with any
</p>
<p>demonstrations of applause. For them a just and kindly
</p>
<p>enthusiasm overrode the strict proprieties of the occasion,
</p>
<p>and handkerchiefs waved and voices cheered all along as
</p>
<p>they marched.
</p>
<p>The head of the procession had reached the railroad sta-
</p>
<p>tion at 2:10. The rear of it had not reached Fourteenth
</p>
<p>street at 5. It must have contained full sixty thousand

<p>the railroad authorities, it was hours before the rear of
</p>
<p>the procession ceased inarching. The allotted route having
</p>
<p>been passed over, the various component parts quickly dis-
</p>
<p>persed to their respective rendezvous.
</p>
<p>The deep sobriety of this ceremony gave it a profound
</p>
<p>and weighty character, far more impressive than the festal
</p>
<p>pomp of most pageants. And the wailing notes of the
</p>
<p>dirges played by the bands greatly increased this effect.
</p>
<p>The streets were in remarkably good condition. The air
</p>
<p>and sky were perfect ; the arrangements for the occasion
</p>
<p>very good indeed ; and in grandeur of form, as well as in
</p>
<p>ethical and political meaning, the great funeral pageant
</p>
<p>given by the City of New York to the remains of Presi-
</p>
<p>dent Lincoln was entirely successful.
</p>
<p>THE CERE3I0NIES IN UNION SQUABE.
</p>
<p>Shortly after the procession had passed through Ufflion
</p>
<p>Square, Tuesday afternoon, a meeting was held for the
</p>
<p>purpose of rendering fitting testimonials of respect and
</p>
<p>reverence for the character of the late President, and join-
</p>
<p>ing in appropriate religious exercises.
</p>
<p>Facing the Maison Doree, a large stand had been erect-
</p>
<p>ed, with the national colors draped in black, and a bro-
</p>
<p>ken column, the design of Mr . Thomas, round the base of
</p>
<p>which a roll of black crape was placed. In the square
</p>
<p>opposite the Spingler house and to the right of the stand,
</p>
<p>was a pedestal beai-ing a bust of President Lincoln, which
</p>
<p>is said to be a striking likeness. It was draped in mourn-
</p>
<p>ing, and attracted much attention. In front of the stand
</p>
<p>about two thousand persons, among whom were a number
</p>
<p>of ladies, had collected, and the windows and doorways of

</p>
<p>the houses within sight and hearing distance of the stand
</p>
<p>were crowded.
</p>
<p>On the stand Avere a large representation of the clergy,
</p>
<p>and deputations from the Union, New York, Century,
</p>
<p>Athenffium, Citj', Union League, Eclectic and other clubs.
</p>
<p>A number of ladies and children were also admitted to
</p>
<p>the stand, which was most inconveniently crowded.
</p>
<p>Hon. John A. King presided. The exercises were opened
</p>
<p>with prayer by Rev. Stephen H. Tyng, during which the
</p>
<p>assemblage remained uncovered. After repeating that beau-
</p>
<p>tiful portion of the burial service, commencing
</p>
<p>" I am the resurrection and the life saith the Lord ; he
</p>
<p>that believeth in me, though he were dead, j^et shall he
</p>
<p>live ; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never
</p>
<p>die," the reverend gentleman said : " God, in whose hands
</p>
<p>is our life. Thou hast pleased in thine infinite wisdom to
</p>
<p>take away the light of our eyes, the desire of the people.
</p>
<p>we bow to thy decree with submission, and we revere
</p>
<p>Thee as the high and lofty One. Thou hast chastened as
</p>
<p>a father chastened his children. We confess Thee as the

</p>
<p>those in bondage. We feel a deep sense of our loss, but
</p>
<p>we bow in humble thankfulness for all our blessings. We
</p>

</p>
<p>OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 127
</p>
<p>After the prayer, the band played the " Dead March."
</p>
<p>Hon. George Bancroft then delivered a feeling oration.
</p>
<p>The delivery of the oration was frequently interrupted by
</p>
<p>applause.
</p>
<p>Rev. Dr. Joseph P. Thompson was then introduced, and
</p>
<p>read President Lincoln's last inaugural address in a very
</p>
<p>impressive manner
</p>
<p>This was followed by the reading, by Eev. W. H. Boole,
</p>
<p>of the 94th Psalm, which was pronounced by the inspired
</p>
<p>Psalmist against the enemies of his country.
</p>
<p>Rev. Dr. Rogers then pronounced an eloquent prayer, in
</p>
<p>which he thanked God that our late President had been
</p>
<p>removed from among us without even a shadow on his
</p>
<p>name, and that a Joshua had been raised up to replace
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>After appropriate music by the band, Rev. Rabbi Isaacs,
</p>
<p>of the Broadway Synagogue, read a selection from the
</p>
<p>Scriptures and delivered a short prayer.
</p>
<p>Rev. Dr. Samuel Osgood then read the following hymn,

<p>decorations and mourning emblems; the people wore sad
</p>
<p>faces, indicative of their sad hearts. The train duly arrived
</p>
<p>at Albany, where the remains were exposed to view and
</p>
<p>viewed by thousands of people and thousands wei-e disap-
</p>
<p>pointed.
</p>
<p>The funeral train left Albany at 4 P. M., Wednesday,
</p>
<p>26th. It was said that delegations from ten counties visited
</p>
<p>Albany to view the remains.. The lying in state and the
</p>
<p>procession there had been marked by all the characteris-
</p>
<p>tics which had signalized the same in other cities. Special
</p>
<p>trains had brought thousands from towns not on the route
</p>
<p>to swell the population of the city. The houses were dec-
</p>
<p>orated Avith fitting emblems and fitting mottoes. The pro-
</p>
<p>cession was beautifully ordered and very impressive. Gov.
</p>
<p>Fenton and staff were on foot immediately after the escort
</p>
<p>which left "Washington, the latter in open carriages. At
</p>
<p>Schenectady, as always before, there was a still multitude
</p>
<p>with uncovered heads. At Canajoharie, the Palatine Bridge
</p>
<p>was clad in flags and mourning, and there was firing of
</p>
<p>guns, tolling of bells, music of bands, an assembled mul-
</p>
<p>titude. A refreshment car accompanied the train, and sup-
</p>
<p>per was had at St. Johnsville. The first young ladies of
</p>
<p>the town, dressed alike in black skirts and white bodices,
</p>
<p>with heavy black rosettes upon the left shoulder, waited
</p>
<p>upon the table and were afterward admitted to the hearse
</p>
<p>car and a view of the coffin. The ladies of Little Falls
</p>
<p>placed fresh flowers upon the coffin. At Herkimer blazing
</p>
<p>torches showed the train in a bright light to an immense

</p>
<p>It was estimated that 25,000 persons were present. Passing
</p>
<p>Oriskany, where the people had kindled a large bonfire,
</p>
<p>the train reached Syracuse at 11:15 P. M. The depot and
</p>
<p>other buildings were draped in mourning, and the scene
</p>
<p>was illuminated with locomotive lamps. A band of music
</p>
<p>played a dirge as the train entered the depot, and a choir
</p>
<p>of 100 voices sang appropriate hymns during the stoppage
</p>
<p>of the train. The crowd of citizens was immense, and
</p>
<p>large delegations came in from Oswego, and the surround-
</p>
<p>ing towns. The train was received by the assembled mul-
</p>
<p>titude with uncovered heads, and with every manifestation
</p>
<p>of heartfelt sorrow. The way stations were illuminated
</p>
<p>with torches and bonfires. At midnight the train reached
</p>
<p>Memphis.
</p>
<p>Thursday, April 27, the remains passed through, Jordon,
</p>
<p>"Weedsport, Port Byron, Savannah, Clyde, Lyons, Newark,
</p>
<p>Palmyra, and other places where the crowds were very large,
</p>
<p>and the train moved past the stations in the light of count-
</p>
<p>less bonfires and torches, arriving at Eochester at 3:20 A. M.
</p>
<p>The cortage stopped 10 minutes at Rochester. The people
</p>
<p>were abroad in full force. The streets in the vicinity of the
</p>
<p>stopping places were crowded. Houses were draped with the
</p>
<p>usual emblems and draped flags.
</p>
<p>BUFFALO
</p>
<p>was reached at 7 A. M. The procession was formed between 7 and
</p>
<p>8 o'clock, and proceeded toward St. James Hall, under a civil

<p>and military escort, in company with the party which had
</p>
<p>followed the remains from Washington. The coffin was

<p>prominently in view of the very many' persons who lined
</p>
<p>OP ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 131
</p>
<p>the streets through which the cortage passed. The hearse
</p>
<p>was heavily covered with black cloth, surmounted with an
</p>
<p>arched roof and tastefully trimmed with white satin and sil-
</p>
<p>ver lace. The body was deposited, beneath a crape canopy
</p>
<p>in St. James Hall, a dirge being chanted in the mean time.
</p>
<p>An elegant harp of choice white flowers was then placed at
</p>
<p>the head of the coffin, and the public were admitted. The
</p>
<p>throng was immense until 8 P. M., when the coffin was closed'.
</p>
<p>The arrangements generally were pronounced to be better
</p>
<p>than elsewhere on the route. At 10 P. M., the train left for
</p>
<p>CLEVELAND.
</p>
<p>At 21:10 A. M , Friday, the 28th, the train arrived at Dun-
</p>
<p>kirk. The chief feature at that place was a group of 36
</p>
<p>young ladies representing the States of the Union. They
</p>
<p>were dressed in white, each with a broad black scarf rest-
</p>
<p>ing on the shoulder, and holding in the hand a National
</p>
<p>flag. The crowd here was dense. The tolling of bells, the
</p>
<p>solemn music of an instrumental band, and the firing of
</p>
<p>minute guns, contributed to the interest of the scene. Pass-
</p>
<p>ing through Braceton, which was illuminated, the train
</p>
<p>reached Westfield at 1 A. M., where a committee of ladies
</p>
<p>brought in a cross and wreath of flowers : On the cross
</p>
<p>were the words : "Ours the cross ; thine the crown." Soon
</p>
<p>after the train reached the state boundary, and General Dix
</p>
<p>and staff took leave of the funeral party. At Wiskliffe Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Brough and staff, of Ohio, came on board ; also Major
</p>
<p>Gen. Hooker and staff. The train arrived at Cleveland at
</p>
<p>7 A. M. On the lake side of the city thousands of per-
</p>
<p>sons were gather-ed on the sloop'ng green hillside, all hav-

<p>ing a good view of the train. High up was seen an
</p>
<p>l32 LIFE AND MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>arch with the inscription, "Abraham Lincoln." It was
</p>
<p>draped in mourning, and the supports were covered with
</p>
<p>alternate Btrips of black and white. The body was borne
</p>
<p>to the park, where a building had been erected especially
</p>
<p>for the reception of the remains. The building was 24 by
</p>
<p>36 feet in dimensions, and 14 feet high fi-om the ground
</p>
<p>to the plate. The roof was of pagoda style, and the raft-
</p>
<p>ers were covered with white cloth over the centre of the
</p>
<p>main roof, and directly over the catafalque a second roof
</p>
<p>was raised about four feet and covered in like manner.
</p>
<p>The catafiilque consisted of a raised dias, and was orna-
</p>
<p>mented with evergreens in the most beautiful manner.
</p>
<p>Silver-fringed drapery was looped to the columns support-
</p>
<p>ing the canopy, the borders of the cornice being illumin-
</p>
<p>ated with white roses and stars of silver. The religious
</p>
<p>services, after the remains had been put on the dias, were
</p>
<p>performed by the Right Rev. Bishop Mcllvaine. He read
</p>
<p>a part of the funeral service of the Episcopal Church,
</p>
<p>slightly altering the text to suit the occasion, and moved
</p>
<p>many of the listeners to tears. The remains were then
</p>
<p>exposed to jmblic view. The arrangements were so per-
</p>
<p>fect that every one who desired to see them had no dif-
</p>
<p>ficulty ; the number visiting them during the day averaging
</p>
<p>180 per minute. At midnight on Friday, April 29th, the
</p>
<p>cortege left Cleveland, in a heavy rain, for Columbus.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the storm, groups of people were assem-
</p>
<p>bled at all the stations, many of them bearing lanterns in
</p>
<p>their hands, in order that the funeral train might be plainly
</p>
<p>Been. The largest gathering was at Condingham, at which

</p>
<p>and bells rung. At 6 a. m. the train passed Eden. The
</p>
<p>rain had ceased and the weather was clear.
</p>
<p>COLUMBUS.
</p>
<p>At 7^ A. M., Saturday, the 20th, the cortege arrived at
</p>
<p>Columbus. The Committee of Arrangements began at once
</p>
<p>to carry out the programme  and place the funeral i^arty
</p>
<p>in carriages. The procession was formed, the 38th Ohio'
</p>
<p>Volunteer Infantry acting as a military escort : then fol-
</p>
<p>lowed the officiating clerg}'-, pall-bearers and others, on
</p>
<p>each side of the hearse. The Veteran Reserve Cor2)s were
</p>
<p>the guard of honor. The rotunda of the Capitol was
</p>
<p>draped in mourning. The coffin was approached by five
</p>
<p>steps. It rested on a mound of moss, in which were dot-
</p>
<p>ted the choicest flowers. At the head of the coffin
</p>
<p>rested a large floral wreath, while directly behind the lat-
</p>
<p>ter were flowers in glass and china vessels, contributed by
</p>
<p>ladies. At the corners of the platform, on the floor, were
</p>
<p>large vaces filled with flowers. The walls were adorned
</p>
<p>with a naval picture representing a scene in the life of
</p>
<p>Commodore Perry, and with various banners which had
</p>
<p>been carried by Ohio troops during the war, torn and rid-
</p>
<p>dled by bullets in many a deadly conflict. No confusion
</p>
<p>whatever was occasioned in entering and retiring fi-om the
</p>
<p>Capitol, owing to the admirable arrangements , and for about
</p>
<p>seven hours there was a constant line of spectators passing
</p>
<p>before- the remains. At 8 p. M. the remains were again con-
</p>
<p>reyed to the train, and the funeral escort left for Indianap-
</p>
<p>olis. Scioto, Hillard's, Pleasant Valley, Unionville, Milford,

<p>road the people appeared to the number of thousands, carry-
</p>
<p>134 LIFK AND MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>ing torches and kindling bonfires, to enable thera clearly to
</p>
<p>see the funeral car. At Woodstock there was both instru-
</p>
<p>mental and vocal music, and the tolling of bells and other
</p>
<p>manifestations of mourning. At Urbana the peojile were
</p>
<p>congregated by thousands. The scene was lit up with a
</p>
<p>hundred torches and bonfires, and the countenances of the
</p>
<p>interested multitude were seen in the lurid glare. Guns
</p>
<p>were fired and bells tolled, and there was music from an
</p>
<p>instrumental band, but the melody which charmed the most
</p>
<p>was from a choir of both males and females stationed upon
</p>
<p>the platform, who sang a deeply impressive hymn. At
</p>
<p>Piqua 10,000 persons were assembled.
</p>
<p>Between 12 and 1 a. m., Sunday 30th, the State line was
</p>
<p>passed, and the train entered Indiana. The weather was
</p>
<p>cold, and the rain was again falling, but there was no di-
</p>
<p>minuation in the crowd assembled at various points. At
</p>
<p>Richmond the train passed under an arched bridge con-
</p>
<p>structed for the purpose by the Air Line Railroad. It had
</p>
<p>a span of 25 feet, and was 30 feet in height. The abut-
</p>
<p>ments were trimmed with evergreens dotted with white
</p>
<p>roses, and the mourning drapery in close association. At
</p>
<p>this point Gov. Morton of Indiana came on board. At
</p>
<p>Cambridge thousands of people were at the depot and the
</p>
<p>train passed under an arch trimmed with evergreens, sur-
</p>
<p>mounted by a female figure to represent the Genius of
</p>
<p>America weeping. The State of Indiana was plunged in
</p>
<p>the depth of grief This was shown, not by the magnificent
</p>
<p>demonstrations in the cities and towns, but along the line

<p>the fiirm houses were decorated with mourning and their in-

<p>INDIANAPOLIS.
</p>
<p>The cortege arrived at Indianapolis at 7 A. M. A proces-
</p>
<p>sion was formed, and through a throng of thousands of spec-
</p>
<p>tators the body of the dead President was borne to the
</p>
<p>State House. The entire structure was beautifully shrouded
</p>
<p>in black and white relieved by evergreen garlands, with a
</p>
<p>fine display of flags. The platform was in the centre of
</p>
<p>the rotunda. On this the coffin was placed, surrounded by
</p>
<p>flowers, while wreaths and floral crosses were laid upon the
</p>
<p>lid. The remains were soon after their arrival exposed to
</p>
<p>public view. The city Councils of Louisville and Cincinnati
</p>
<p>and a delegation from Covington, together with Governor
</p>
<p>Bramlette of Kentucky, wei'c in the city to take part in
</p>
<p>the funeral procession. Thousands of persons from the sur-
</p>
<p>rounding country thronged the city. The Sabbath-School
</p>
<p>children were the first admitted, then the ladies and citi-
</p>
<p>zens severally passed through the hall from South to North.
</p>
<p>At midnight of Sunday, the remains left Indianapolis for
</p>
<p>Chicago. The usual emblems of mourning were seen on the
</p>
<p>roxite. At Michigan City the train passed beneath a number
</p>
<p>of beautiful arches erected in memory of the honored dead.
</p>
<p>Soon afterward the boundry line was passed, and the cor-
</p>
<p>tege entered Illinois.

</p>
<p>oquent funeral oration at Bryan Hall to an immense audi-
</p>
<p>ence. Minute guns and tolling and chiming bells, an-

<p>nounced the arrival of the President's remains. The re-
</p>
<p>mains of the President were conveyed to the Court House,
</p>
<p>which was opened to the public at 6 o'clock in the after-
</p>
<p>noon, and remained open till 7 o'clock p. M. of the next
</p>
<p>day, thousands of persons crowding thither to see for the

<p>last time the face of the lamented dead.

<p>CHICAGO TO SPRINGFIELD.
</p>
<p>The route to Springfield was one grand series of bonfires
</p>
<p>burning at every station, lighting up the darkness, and show-
</p>
<p>ing to advantage the train, as well as the decorated stands
</p>
<p>where stood the men and women. Many places had instru-
</p>
<p>mental and vocal music, chanting dirges and performing re-
</p>
<p>quiems. The train reached Springfield about daylight, where
</p>
<p>an immense throng was gathered to witness the reception,
</p>
<p>etc.
</p>
<p>SPRINGFIELD.
</p>
<p>After placing the cofiSn in the hearse, the procession form-
</p>
<p>ed and proceeded to the Capitol, which had been highly
</p>
<p>adorned in every part for the occasion. The catafalque was
</p>
<p>built in the Hall of Representatives, which was festooned
</p>
<p>with rich mourning drapery, and had plants and flowers dis>
</p>
<p>tributed in tasteful display. The canopy, beautiful in it-
</p>
<p>self, was handsomely decorated in a style of magnificence
</p>
<p>unsurpassed by anything connected with the pageant from
</p>
<p>Washington through all of the cities. The ground and build-
</p>
<p>ings were given in charge of Co. E, 23d Regiment Veteran
</p>
<p>Reserve Corps. About 10 o'clock a. m.. May 2nd, the ar-

<p>rangements were completed and the people were admitted.
</p>
<p>OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 137
</p>
<p>For twenty four hours the throng passed, even through the
</p>
<p>night. May 3d, at 11 o'clock, the procession formed and
</p>
<p>moved off toward Oak Ridge Cemetry. On the route the
</p>
<p>band played "Dead March in Saul," with solemn and mourn-
</p>
<p>ful effect. The gate of tbe cemetry was ornamented with
</p>
<p>evergreens and flowers. The coffin being deposited in the
</p>
<p>cemetery, the exercises were opened by Rev. A. Hall, in an
</p>
<p>appropriate prayer, and a dirge followed. The Rev. N. W.
</p>
<p>Miner then read choice selections from the books of St. John
</p>
<p>and St. Paul; after which Rev. N. C. Hubbard read the
</p>
<p>last inaugural of Mr. Lincoln. Bishop Simpson then arose
</p>
<p>to deliver his address, to which all listened attentively and
</p>
<p>gravely. He commenced as follows:
</p>
<p>BISHOP SIMPSON'S ADDRESS.
</p>
<p>Fellow-citizens of Illinois and of many parts of our entire
</p>
<p>Union, near the Capital of this large and growing State of
</p>
<p>Illinois :
</p>
<p>In the midst of this beautiful grove, and at the open
</p>
<p>mouth of this vault, which has just received the remains
</p>
<p>of our fallen chieftain, we gather to pay a tribute of re-
</p>
<p>spect and to drop the tears of sorrow around the ashes of
</p>
<p>the mighty dead. A little more than four years ago,
</p>
<p>from his plain, quiet home in yonder city, he started, receiving
</p>
<p>the parting words of the concourse of friends who gather-
</p>
<p>ed around him, and in the midst of the dropping of the
</p>
<p>gentle shower, he told of the pangs of parting from the
</p>
<p>place where his children had been born, and his home had
</p>
<p>been made pleasant by early recollections ; and as he left,

</p>
<p>he made an earnest request, in the hearing of some who
</p>
<p>138 LIFE AND MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>are present at this meeting, that, as he was about to en-
</p>
<p>ter upon the responsibilities which he believed to be greater
</p>
<p>than any which had fallen upon any man since the days
</p>
<p>of Washington, the people would offer up prayers that God
</p>
<p>would aid and sustain him in the work which they had
</p>
<p>given him to do. His company left our quiet city, but as
</p>
<p>it went, snares were in waiting for the Chief Magistrate.
</p>
<p>Scarcely did he escape the dangers of the way, or the
</p>
<p>hands of the assassin as he neared Washington, and I be-
</p>
<p>lieve he escaped only through the vigilance of officers and
</p>
<p>the prayers of his people, so that the blow was suspended
</p>
<p>for more than four years, which was at last permitted,
</p>
<p>through the providence of God, to fall. How different the
</p>
<p>occasion which witnessed his departure from that which
</p>
<p>witnessed his return ! You expected to take him by the
</p>
<p>hand, to feel the warm grasp which you had felt in other
</p>
<p>days, and to see the tall form walking among you which
</p>
<p>you had delighted to honor in years past. But he was
</p>
<p>never permitted to return until he came with lips mute
</p>
<p>and silent, the frame encoffined, and a weeping nation fol-
</p>
<p>lowed as his mourners.
</p>
<p>Such a scene as his return to you, was never witnessed
</p>
<p>among the events of histoiy. There have been great pro-
</p>
<p>cessions of mourners. There was one for the Patriarch
</p>
<p>Jacob, which came up from Egypt, and the Egyptians
</p>
<p>wondered at the evidences of reverence and filial affection
</p>
<p>which came from the hearts of the Israelites. There was
</p>
<p>mourning when Moses fell upon the heights of Pisgah, and
</p>
<p>vanished from human view. There have been mournings

<p>in the kingdoms of the earth, when Kings and Princes
</p>
<p>OP ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 139
</p>
<p>have fallen ; but never was there in the history of man
</p>
<p>such mourning as that which has accompanied this funeral
</p>
<p>procession, and has gathered around the mortal remains of
</p>
<p>him who was our loved one, and who now sleeps
</p>
<p>among us.
</p>
<p>If we glance at the procession which followed him, we
</p>
<p>see how the nation stood aghast ! Tears filled the eyes of
</p>
<p>manly, sun-burnt faces; strong men, as they clasped the
</p>
<p>hands of their friends, were unable to find vent for their
</p>
<p>grief in words. Women and childi*en caught up the tid-
</p>
<p>ings as they ran through the land, and were melted into
</p>
<p>tears. The nation stood still, and men left their plows in
</p>
<p>the field and asked what the end should be. The hum of
</p>
<p>manufactories ceased, and the sound of the hammer was
</p>
<p>not heard. Busy merchants closed their doors, and in
</p>
<p>the Exchange gold passed no more from hand to hand.
</p>
<p>Though three weeks have passed, the nation has scarcely
</p>
<p>breathed easily yet. A mournful silence is abroad upon
</p>
<p>the land. Nor is this mom-ning confined to any class, or
</p>
<p>to any district of country. Men of all political parties,
</p>
<p>and of all religious creeds, have united in paying this
</p>
<p>mournful tribute. The Archbishop of the Eoman Catholic
</p>
<p>Church, in New York, and a Protestant Minister, walked
</p>
<p>side by side in the sad procession, and a Jewish Eabbi
</p>
<p>performed a part of the solemn services.
</p>
<p>There are gathered around this tomb the representatives
</p>
<p>of the army and navy. Senators, Judges, Governors, and
</p>
<p>officers of all the branches of the Government. Here, too,
</p>
<p>are all members of civic professions, with men and women

</p>
<p>and there, too, are tears as sincere and warm as any that
</p>
<p>drop, which come from the eyes of those whose kindred
</p>
<p>and whose race have been freed from their chains by him
</p>
<p>whom they moui-n as their deliverer. Far more have gazed
</p>
<p>on the face of the departed than ever looked upon the
</p>
<p>face of any other departed man. More races have looked
</p>
<p>on the procession for 1,G00 miles or more, by night and
</p>
<p>by day, by sunlight, dawn, twilight, and by torchlight,
</p>
<p>than ever before watched the pi'ogress of a procession.
</p>
<p>We ask, why this wonderful mourning, this great pro-
</p>
<p>cession? I answer, first, a part of the interest has
</p>
<p>arisen from the times in which we live, and in which he,
</p>
<p>that has flxllen, was a pi'incipal actor. It is a principle of
</p>
<p>our nature that feeling once excited, readily leave the ob-
</p>
<p>ject by which they are excited lor some other object, which
</p>
<p>may, for the time being, take possession of the mind.
</p>
<p>Another principle is, that the deepest affections of our
</p>
<p>hearts gather around some human form, in which are em-
</p>
<p>bodied the living thoughts and ideas of the passing ages.
</p>
<p>If Ave look, then, at the times we see an age of excite-
</p>
<p>ment. For four years the popular heart has been stirred
</p>
<p>to its utmost dejiths. War had come upon us, devouring
</p>
<p>families, separating nearest and dearest friends, a war, the
</p>
<p>extent and magnitude of which no one could estimate; a
</p>
<p>war in which the blood of brethren was shed by a broth-
</p>
<p>er's hand. A call tor soldiers was made by this voice now
</p>
<p>hushed, and all over this land, from hill and mountain,
</p>
<p>from plain and valley, there sprung up hundreds of thous-
</p>
<p>ands of bold hearts, ready to go forth and save our na-
</p>
<p>tional Union.

</p>
<p>The feeling of excitement was transferred next into a
</p>
<p>OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. l41
</p>
<p>feeling of deep grief, because of the danger in which our
</p>
<p>country was placed. Many said, "Is it possible to save our
</p>
<p>nation?" Some in our country, and nearly all the leading
</p>
<p>men in other countries, declared it to be impossible to
</p>
<p>maintain the Union, and many an honest and patriotic
</p>
<p>heart wab deeply pained with apprehensions of common
</p>
<p>ruin; and many in grief, and almost in despair, anxiously
</p>
<p>inquired, "What shall the end of these things be? In ad-
</p>
<p>dition to this, wives had given their husbands, mothers
</p>
<p>their sons, the pride and joy of their hearts. They saw
</p>
<p>them put on the uniform  they saw them take the martial
</p>
<p>step, and they tried to hide their deep feeling of sadness.
</p>
<p>Many dear ones stepped upon the battle-field never to re-
</p>
<p>turn again, and there was mourning in every mansion and
</p>
<p>in every cabin in our broad land.
</p>
<p>Then came a feeling of deeper sadness, as the story
</p>
<p>came of prisoners tortui^ed to death or starved, through
</p>
<p>the mandates of those Avho are called the representatives
</p>
<p>of chivalry, or who claim to be honorable ones of the
</p>
<p>earth; and as we read the stories of frames attenuated
</p>
<p>and reduced to mere skeletons, our grief turned partly in-
</p>
<p>to horror and partly into a cry for vengeance. Then this
</p>
<p>feeling was changed to one of joy. There came signs of
</p>
<p>the end of this rebellion. We followed the cue of our
</p>
<p>glorious Genei'als. We saw our army under the command
</p>
<p>of the brave officer who is guiding this procession, climb
</p>
<p>np the hights of Lookout Mountain and drive the rebels
</p>
<p>from their strongholds. Another brave General swept
</p>
<p>through Georgia, South and North Carolina, and drove the
</p>
<p>combined armies of the rebels before him, while the hon-

<p>142 LIFEAN' DM ARTY ROOM
</p>
<p>ored Lieutenant-General held Lee and his followers in a
</p>
<p>death-grasp.
</p>
<p>Then the tidings came that Richmond was evacuated and
</p>
<p>that Lee had surrendered. The bells rang merrily all over
</p>
<p>the land. The booming of cannon was heard, illuminations
</p>
<p>and torchlight jjrocessions manifested the general joy, and
</p>
<p>families were looking for the speedy return of their loved
</p>
<p>ones from the field of battle. Just in the wildest joy, in
</p>
<p>one hour, nay, in one moment the tidings thrilled through-
</p>
<p>out the land that Abraham Lincoln, the best of Presidents,
</p>
<p>had perished by the hands of an assassin, and then all
</p>
<p>that feeling which had been gathering for four years in the
</p>
<p>form of excitement, grief, horror, and joy, turned into one
</p>
<p>wail of woe ; a sadness ines'pressible, an anguish unutter-
</p>
<p>able ; but it was not the times, merely, which caused the
</p>
<p>mourning. The mode of his death must be taken into the
</p>
<p>account. Had he died on a bed of sickness, with kind
</p>
<p>friends around him ; had the sweat of death been wiped
</p>
<p>from his brow by gentle hands while he was yet conscious ;
</p>
<p>could he have had power to speak words of affection to
</p>
<p>his stricken widow; words of comfort to us, like those
</p>
<p>which we heard in parting, and at Washington, in his in-
</p>
<p>augural, which shall now be immortal ; but it would have
</p>
<p>softened or assuaged something of the grief  there might
</p>
<p>at least have been preparation for the event. But no
</p>
<p>moment of warning was given to him or to us. He was
</p>
<p>stricken down, too, when his hopes for the end of the re-
</p>
<p>bellion were bright, and the prospect of a joyous life was
</p>
<p>before him.

</p>
<p>There was a Cabinet meeting that day, said to have been
</p>
<p>OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 143
</p>
<p>the most cheerful and happy of any held since the beginning
</p>
<p>of the rebellion. After this meeting he talked with his
</p>
<p>friends, and spoke of the four years of tempest ; of the
</p>
<p>storm being over ; and of the four years of pleasure and
</p>
<p>joy now awaiting him, as the weight of care or anguish
</p>
<p>would be taken from his mind, and he could have happy
</p>
<p>days with his family again. In the midst of his anticipa-
</p>
<p>tions, he left his house never to return alive. The evening
</p>
<p>was Grood Friday  the saddest day in the whole calendar for the
</p>
<p>Christian church, henceforth, in this country to be made sad-
</p>
<p>der, if possible, by the memory of the nation's loss ; and so
</p>
<p>filled with grief was every Christian heart, that even all the
</p>
<p>joyous thought of Easter Sunday failed to move the crush-
</p>
<p>ing sorrow, under which the true worshipper bowed in the
</p>
<p>house of God.
</p>
<p>But the great cause of this mourning is to be found in
</p>
<p>the man himself. Mr. Lincoln was no ordinary man, and I
</p>
<p>believe the conviction has been growing on the nation's mind,
</p>
<p>as it certainly has been on my own, especially in the last
</p>
<p>years of his administration, that, by the hand of God, he was
</p>
<p>especially singled out to guide our Government in these troub-
</p>
<p>lous times, and, it seems to me, that the hand of God may
</p>
<p>be traced in many of the events connected with his history.
</p>
<p>First, then, I recognize this in the physical education which
</p>
<p>he received, and which prepared him for enduring herculean
</p>
<p>labor, in the toils of his boyhood and the labors of his man-
</p>
<p>hood, God was giving him an iron frame. Next to this was
</p>
<p>his identification with the heart of the great people, under-
</p>
<p>standing their feelings, because he was one of them, and con^

</p>
<p>nected with them in their movements and life. His educa-
</p>
<p>144 I, IFE AND MARTTRI>OM
</p>
<p>tion was simple : a few months spent in a school-house, which
</p>
<p>gave him the elements of education. lie read a few books,
</p>
<p>but mastered all he read. Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, fa-
</p>
<p>bles, and the Life of Washington, were his favorities. In
</p>
<p>these we recognize the works which gave the bias to his
</p>
<p>character, and which partly molded his style. His early life,
</p>
<p>with its varied struggles, joined him indissolubly to the work-
</p>
<p>ing masses, and no elevation in society diminished his respect
</p>
<p>for the sons of toil. He knew what it was to fell the tall
</p>
<p>trees of the forest, and to stem the current of the hard
</p>
<p>Mississippi. His home was in the growing West, the heart
</p>
<p>of the Republic, and, invigorated by the wind which swept
</p>
<p>over its prairies, he learned lessons of self-reliance, which sus-
</p>
<p>tained him in seasons of adversity. His genius was soon re-
</p>
<p>cognized, as true genius always will be, and he was placed
</p>
<p>in the Legislature of his State. Already acquainted with the
</p>
<p>principles of law, he devoted his thoughts to matters of pub-
</p>
<p>lic interest, and soon began to be looked upon as the com-
</p>
<p>ing statesman.
</p>
<p>As early as 1849 he presented resolutions in the Legisla-
</p>
<p>ture, asking for emancipation in the District of Columbia,
</p>
<p>while, with but rare exceptions, the whole popular mind of
</p>
<p>his State was opposed to the measure. From that hour he
</p>
<p>was a steady and uniform friend of humanity, and was pre-
</p>
<p>paring for the conflict of later years.
</p>
<p>You ask me on what mental characteristics his greatness
</p>
<p>resteil. I answer, on a quick and ready perception of facts ;
</p>
<p>on a memory unusually tenacious and retentive ; and on a
</p>
<p>logical turn of mind, which followed sternly and unwavering-
</p>
<p>ly every link in the chain of thought, on any subject which

</p>
<p>he was called on to investigate. I think there have been
</p>
<p>OF ABRAHAM LINCOLX. 143
</p>
<p>minds more broad in their character, more comprehensive in
</p>
<p>their scope; but I doubt if ever there has been a man who
</p>
<p>could follow step by step, with logical power, the points
</p>
<p>which he desired to illustrate. He gained this power by a
</p>
<p>close study of geometry, and by a determination to persevere
</p>
<p>in the truth in its relations and simplicity.
</p>
<p>It is said of him that in childhood, when he had any
</p>
<p>difficulty in listening to a conversation to ascertain what peo-
</p>
<p>ple meant, if he tried to rest, he could not sleep until he
</p>
<p>tried to understand the precise points intended, and when un-
</p>
<p>derstood, to convey them in a clearer manner to those who
</p>
<p>did not. Who that has read his messages fails to perceive
</p>
<p>the directness and the simplicity of his style ; and this very
</p>
<p>trait, which was scoffed at and derided by opponents, is now
</p>
<p>recognized as one of the strong points of that mighty mind
</p>
<p>which has so powerfully influenced the destiny of this nation,
</p>
<p>and which shall for ages to come influence the destiny of
</p>
<p>humanity.
</p>
<p>It is not, however, chiefly by his mental faculties that he
</p>
<p>gained such control over mankind. His moral power gave
</p>
<p>him pre-eminence. The convictions of men that Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln was an honest man, led them to yield to his guid-
</p>
<p>ance. As has been said of Mr. Cobden, whom he greatly re-
</p>
<p>spected, he made every man feel a better sense of himself 
</p>
<p>a recognizement of individuality  a self-relying power. They
</p>
<p>saw in him a man vt^hom they believed would do what was
</p>
<p>right, regardless of all consequences. It was the moral feel-
</p>
<p>ing vphich gave him the greatest hold on the people, and
</p>
<p>made his utterances almost oracular.
</p>

</p>
<p>nations in allowing privateers to be fitted out, he uttered the
</p>
<p>146 LIFE AND MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>Bignificant expression, "One war at a time," and it stilled
</p>
<p>the national heart. When his own friends were divided aa
</p>
<p>to what steps shou.d be taken as to slavery, that simple ut-
</p>
<p>terance, " I will save the Union, if I can, with slavery ; but
</p>
<p>if not slavery must perish ; for the Union must be preserved"
</p>
<p> became the rallying word* Men felt the struggle was for
</p>
<p>the Union, and all other questions must be subsidiary. But
</p>
<p>after all, by the acts of a man shall his fame be perpetua-
</p>
<p>ted. Much praise is due to the men who aided him. He
</p>
<p>called able counselors around him, and able Generals into
</p>
<p>the field  men who have borne the sword as bravely as ever
</p>
<p>any human arm has borne it. He had the aid of prayerful
</p>
<p>and thoughtful men every-where, but under his own guiding
</p>
<p>hands the movements of our land have been conducted. Turn
</p>
<p>toward the different departments. We had an unorganized mi-
</p>
<p>litia, a mere skeleton army, yet, under his care, that army
</p>
<p>has been enlarged into a force which, for skill, intelligence,
</p>
<p>efficiency and bravery, surpasses any which the world has
</p>
<p>ever seen. Before its veterans, the face of even the renowned
</p>
<p>veterans of Napoleon shall pale. [Applause.] And the moth-
</p>
<p>ers and sisters on these hill-sides, and all over the land,
</p>
<p>shall take to their arms again braver men than ever fought
</p>
<p>in European wars. The reason is obvious. Money, or a de-
</p>
<p>sire for fame collected those armiee, or they were rallied to
</p>
<p>sustain favorite thrones or dynasties; but the armies, he called
</p>
<p>into being fought for liberty, for the Union, and for the
</p>
<p>right of self-government; and many of them felt that the
</p>
<p>battles they won were for humanity every-where and for all
</p>
<p>time ; for I believe that God has not suffered this terrible

</p>
<p>rebellion to come upon our land merely for a chastisement
</p>
<p>OF ABRAHAM LINCOLK. 147
</p>
<p>to US, or a lesson to our age. There are moments which in-
</p>
<p>volve in themselves eternities. There are instants which seem
</p>
<p>to contain germs which shall develop and bioom forever.
</p>
<p>Such a moment came in the tide of time, to our land, wh^n
</p>
<p>a question must be settled  the power of affecting all the
</p>
<p>earth. The contest was for huiuan freedom, not for this Re-
</p>
<p>public merely ; not for the Union simply, but to decide
</p>
<p>whether the people, as a people, in their entire majesty, were
</p>
<p>destined to be the Government, or whether they were to be
</p>
<p>subject to tyrants or autocrats, or to class rule of any kind.
</p>
<p>This is the great question for which we have been fight-
</p>
<p>ins, and its decision is at hand ; and the result of the con-
</p>
<p>test will affect the ages to come. If successful, republics will
</p>
<p>spread, in spite of monarchs, all over this earth. [Exclama-
</p>
<p>tions of "Amen ; " " Thank God."]
</p>
<p>I turn from the army to the navy. What was it when
</p>
<p>the war commenced? Now we have our ships of war at
</p>
<p>home and abroad to guard privateers in foreign sympathizing
</p>
<p>ports, as well as to care for every part of our own coast.
</p>
<p>They have taken forts that military men said could not be
</p>
<p>taken ; and a brave Admiral, for the first time in the world's
</p>
<p>history, lashes himself to the mast, there to remain as long
</p>
<p>as he had a particle of skill or strength to watch over hia
</p>
<p>ship while it engaged in the perilous contest of taking the
</p>
<p>strong forts of the enemy.
</p>
<p>Then, again, I turn to the Treasury Department. Where
</p>
<p>should the money come from? Wise men predicted ruin ; but
</p>
<p>our national credit has been maintained and our currency is
</p>
<p>safer to-day than it ever was before. Not only so, but through

</p>
<p>our national bonds, if properly used, we shall have a perma-
</p>
<p>148 LIFE AND MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>nent basis for currency, and an investment so desirable for
</p>
<p>capitalists of other nations, that under the laws of trade, I
</p>
<p>believe the center of exchange will be transferred from Eng-
</p>
<p>land to the United States.
</p>
<p>But the great act of the mighty chieftain, on which hia
</p>
<p>fame shall rest long after his frame shall molder away, is
</p>
<p>that of giving fi'eedom to a race. We have all been
</p>
<p>taught to revere the sacred characters. We have thought
</p>
<p>of Moses, of his power, and the prominence he gave to
</p>
<p>the moral law, and how his name now towers high among
</p>
<p>the names in heaven, and how he delivered three millions
</p>
<p>of his kindred out of bondage ; and yet we may assert
</p>
<p>that Abraham Lincoln, by his proclamation, liberated more
</p>
<p>enslaved people than ever Moses set free, and those not
</p>
<p>of his kindred or of his race. Such a power or such an
</p>
<p>opportunity has seldom been given to man. When other
</p>
<p>events shall have been forgotten ; when the world shall
</p>
<p>become a net-work of republics ; when every throne shall
</p>
<p>have been swept from the face of the earth ; when litera-
</p>
<p>ture shall enlighten all minds ; when the claims of human-
</p>
<p>ity shall be recognized everywhere, this act shall still be
</p>
<p>conspicuous on the pages of history ; and we are thankful
</p>
<p>that God gave to Abraham Lincoln the decision and wisdom
</p>
<p>and grace to issue that proclamation, which stands high
</p>
<p>above all other papers which have been penned by unin-
</p>
<p>spired men. [Applause.]
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln was a good man ; he was known as
</p>
<p>an honest, temperate, forgiving man; a just man; a man
</p>
<p>of a noble heart in every way. As to his religious

<p>experience, I cannot speak definately, because I was not
</p>
<p>OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 149
</p>
<p>privileged to know much of his private sentiments. My
</p>
<p>acquaintance with him did not give me the^ opportunity to
</p>
<p>hear him speak on those topics. This I know, however'
</p>
<p>he read the Bible frequently, loved it for its great truths,
</p>
<p>and profound teachings ; and he tried to be guided by its
</p>
<p>precepts. He believed in Christ, the Saviour of sinners,
</p>
<p>and I think he was sincerely trying to bring his life into
</p>
<p>the principles of revealed religion. Certainly, if there ever
</p>
<p>was a man who illustrated some of the principles of pure
</p>
<p>religion, that man was our departed President. Look over
</p>
<p>all his speeches ; listen to his utterances. He never spoke
</p>
<p>unkindly of any man ; even the rebels received no words
</p>
<p>of anger from him ; and the last day illustrated, in a re-
</p>
<p>markable manner, his forgiving disposition. A dispatch
</p>
<p>was received that afternoon, that Thompson and Tucker
</p>
<p>were trying to make their escape through Maine, and it
</p>
<p>was proposed to arrest them. Mr. Lincoln, however, pre-
</p>
<p>ferred, rather to let them quietly escape. He was seeking
</p>
<p>to save the very men who had been plotting his destruction,
</p>
<p>and this morning we read a proclamation oifering $25,000
</p>
<p>for the arrest of these men, as aiders and abettors of
</p>
<p>assassination. So that in his expiring acts he was saying,
</p>
<p>"Father, forgive them; they know not what they do."
</p>
<p>To the address of a large religious body he replied ;
</p>
<p>*' Thanks be unto God, who, in our national trials, giveth
</p>
<p>us th churches." To a minister who said "he hoped the
</p>
<p>Lord was on our side," he replied that it gave him no concern
</p>
<p>whether the Lord was on our side or not, "for" he added
</p>
<p>" I know the Lord is always on the side of right"; and

<p>with deep feeling added, " but God is my witness that it
</p>
<p>150 LIFE AND MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>is my constant anxiety and prayer that both myself and
</p>
<p>this nation should be on the Lord's side."
</p>
<p>As a rule, I doubt if any President has ever shown such
</p>
<p>a trust in God, or in jiublic documents so frequently
</p>
<p>referred to Divine aid. Often did he remark to friends
</p>
<p>and to delegations that his hope for our success rested in
</p>
<p>his conviction that God would bless our efforts, because
</p>
<p>we were trying to do right.
</p>
<p>In his domestic life he was exceedingly kind and affec
</p>
<p>tionate. He was a devoted husband and father. During
</p>
<p>his Presidential term he lost his second son, Willie. To
</p>
<p>an officer of the army he said not long since : " Do you
</p>
<p>ever find yourself talking with the dead?" and added 
</p>
<p>" Since Willie's death, I catch myself every day involun-
</p>
<p>tarily talking with him as if he were with me."
</p>
<p>On his widow, who is unable to be here, I need only
</p>
<p>invoke the blessing of Almighty God, that she may be
</p>
<p>comforted and sustained. For his son, who has witnessed
</p>
<p>the exercises of this hour, all that I can desire is that the
</p>
<p>mantle of his father may fall upon him. [Exclamations of
</p>
<p>"Amen."]
</p>
<p>Let us pause a moment on the lesson of the hour before
</p>
<p>we part. This man, though he fell by an assassin, still
</p>
<p>fell under the permissive hand of God. He had some
</p>
<p>wise purpose in allowing him so to fall. What more
</p>
<p>could he have desired of life to himself? Were not his
</p>
<p>honors full ? There was no office to which he could aspire.
</p>
<p>The popular heart clung around him as around no other
</p>
<p>man. The nations of the world had learned to honor

<p>our Chief Magistrate. If rumors of a desired alliance with
</p>
<p>OP ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 151
</p>
<p>England be true, Napoleon trembled when he heard of the
</p>
<p>fall of Richmond, and asked what nation would join him to
</p>
<p>protect him against our Government.
</p>
<p>Besides, the guidance of such a man, his fame, was full ;
</p>
<p>his work was done, and he sealed his glory by becoming the
</p>
<p>nation's great martyr for liberty.
</p>
<p>He appears to have had a strange presentiment early in
</p>
<p>his political life that some day he would be President. You
</p>
<p>see it indicated in 1839. Of the slave power he said : " Broken
</p>
<p>by it I too may be; bow to it I never will. The probability
</p>
<p>that we may fail in this struggle, ought not to deter us
</p>
<p>irom the support of a cause which we deem to be just. It
</p>
<p>shall not deter me. If ever I feel the soul within me
</p>
<p>elevate and expand to those dimensions not wholly unworthy
</p>
<p>of its Almighty architect, it is when I contemplate the cause
</p>
<p>of my country. Deserted by all the world beside, and
</p>
<p>standing up boldly and alone, and hurling defiance at her
</p>
<p>victorious oppressors ; here, without contemplating consequences,
</p>
<p>before high heaved and in the face of the world, I swear
</p>
<p>eternal fidelity to the just cause, as I deem it, of the land
</p>
<p>of my life, my liberty, and my love." And yet secretly he
</p>
<p>said to more than one, " I never shall live out the four years
</p>
<p>of my term. When the rebellion is crushed, my work is
</p>
<p>done." So it was. He lived to see the last battle fought,
</p>
<p>and to dictate a dispatch from the home of Jeflferson Davis ;
</p>
<p>lived till the power of the rebellion was broken, and then,
</p>
<p>having done the work for which God had sent him, angels,
</p>
<p>I trust, were sent to shield him from one moment of pain
</p>
<p>or suffering, and to bear him from this world to that high
</p>
<p>and glorious realm where the patriot and the good shall live

<p>His example teaches young men that every position of
</p>
<p>eminence is open before the diligent and the worthy, to the
</p>
<p>ictive men of the country. His example urges the country
</p>
<p>to trust in God and do right.
</p>
<p>Standing as we do to-day, by his coffin and sepulcher, let
</p>
<p>us resolve to carry forward the policy which he so nobly
</p>
<p>began. Let us do right to all men. Let us vow, in the
</p>
<p>sight of Heaven, eradicate every vestige of huuiau slavery .
</p>
<p>to give every human being his true position before God and
</p>
<p>man ; to crush every form of rebellion, and to stand by the
</p>
<p>flag which God has given us. How joyful that it floated
</p>
<p>over a part of every State before Mr. Lincoln's career was
</p>
<p>ended.
</p>
<p>How singular that, to the fact of the assassin's heel being
</p>
<p>caught in the folds of the flag, we are probably indebted
</p>
<p>for his capture. The flag and the traitor must ever be
</p>
<p>enemies.
</p>
<p>Traitors will probably suffer by the change of rulers, for
</p>
<p>one of sterner mold, and who himself has deeply suffered
</p>
<p>from the rebellion, now wields the sword of justice.
</p>
<p>Our country, too, is stronger for the trial. A republic
</p>
<p>was declared by monarchists to weak to endure a civil war.
</p>
<p>Yet we have crushed the most gigantic rebellion in history,
</p>
<p>and have grown in strength and population every year of
</p>
<p>the struggle. We have passed through the ordeal of a pop-
</p>
<p>ular election, while swords and bayonets were in the field,
</p>
<p>and have come out unharmed.
</p>
<p>And now in an hour of excitement, with a large minority
</p>
<p>having preferred another man for President, the bullet of
</p>
<p>the assassin has laid our President prostrate. Has there been

</p>
<p>a mutiny? Has any rival proposed his claims? Out of an
</p>
<p>OP ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 153
</p>
<p>army of near a million, no officer or soldier uttered ono
</p>
<p>note of dissent ; and in an hour or two after Mr. Lincoln's
</p>
<p>death, another leader, with constitutional powers, occupied his
</p>
<p>chair, and the Government moved forward without a single
</p>
<p>jar. The world will learn that republics are the strongest
</p>
<p>governments on earth.
</p>
<p>To the ambitious there is this fearful lesson : Of the four
</p>
<p>candidates for Presidential honors in 18G0, two of them
</p>
<p>Douglas and Lincoln, once competitors  but now sleeping pa-
</p>
<p>triots  rest from their labors ; Bell perished in poverty and
</p>
<p>misery, as a traitor might perish, and Breckinridge is a
</p>
<p>frightened fugitive, with the brand of traitor on his brow.
</p>
<p>And now, my friends, in the words of the departed, "With
</p>
<p>malice toward none ;'' free from all feeling of personal ven-
</p>
<p>geance, yet believing the sword must not be borne in vain,
</p>
<p>let us go forward, even in painful duty. Let every man
</p>
<p>who was a Senator, or Representative in Congress, and who
</p>
<p>aided in beginning this rebellion, and thus led to the slaugh-
</p>
<p>ter of our sons and daughters, be brought to speedy and to
</p>
<p>certain punishment. Let every officer educated at public ex-
</p>
<p>pense, and who, having been advanced to position has per-
</p>
<p>jured himself, and has turned his sword against the vitals of
</p>
<p>his country, be doomed to a felon's death. This, I believe,
</p>
<p>is the will of the American people. Men may attempt to
</p>
<p>compromise and to restore these traitors and murderers to
</p>
<p>society again, but the American people will rise in their
</p>
<p>majesty and sweep all such compromises and compromisers
</p>
<p>away, and shall declare that there shall be no peace to
</p>
<p>rebels.

</p>
<p>The closing prayer was offered up by Dr. Harkey. Next
</p>
<p>in continuation was the requiem, "Peace, troubled soul," the

<p>benediction by Dr. P. D. Gurley, the President's former pas-

<p>tor, and last of all, a funeral hymn, composed by Dr. Gur-

<p>REMINISCENCES AND INCIDENTS.
</p>
<p>MR. LINCOLN AND JOHN E. Mc DONOUGH, THE ACTO R.
</p>
<p>In an address delivered on the 24th of April hy Hon. W.
</p>
<p>D. Kelly before the Girls' High and Normal School of
</p>
<p>Philadelphia, the speaker referred to a number of interesting
</p>
<p>incidents in the life and character of Mr. Ijincoln, and among
</p>
<p>other things spoke of an interview betv^een Mr. Lincoln and
</p>
<p>the well-known actor, John E. McDonough. Mr. Kelly thus
</p>
<p>describes this meeting :
</p>
<p>On a very rainy night during the session of Congress pre-
</p>
<p>ceding the last, I found at my room Rev. Benjamin R. Mil-
</p>
<p>ler, Chaplain of the 118th Pennsylvania Volunteers, and Mr.
</p>
<p>John E. McDonough, the actor, who was on the next night
</p>
<p>to begin playing in Washington his extravaganza of the
</p>
<p>"Seven Sisters," by which he had done considerable in pro-
</p>
<p>moting patriotic feeling among the young people in the coun-
</p>
<p>try. Duty and pleasure prompted me to give the evening to
</p>
<p>them in some way, and I felt that I might do good to
</p>
<p>them, perhaps to myself  perhaps to my country, too  by
</p>
<p>taking them to see our good President. I proposed that we
</p>
<p>should go ; they readily assented, and we started at once for
</p>
<p>the White House. We found Mr. Lincoln alone ; and, on

</p>
<p>entering, I said to him that we had come to trouble him
</p>
<p>professionally, and probably to perplex him somewhat, as we
</p>
<p>represented three professions  the law, divinity and the histrionic
</p>
<p>profession. I introduced my friend Miller as the reverend
</p>
<p>chaplain, and Mr. McDonough as "Mrs. Pluto," the name of
</p>
<p>the character he sustained in th(3 extravaganza.
</p>
<p>" Well," said the President, " pray tell me, how do your
</p>
<p>chaplain and 'Mrs. Pluto' get along together? I should think
</p>
<p>there might be some discord in a family made up of such
</p>
<p>materials."
</p>
<p>They were soon seated, at his bidding, and, after a few
</p>
<p>words to the chaplain, who had come from the field, he
</p>
<p>turned to Mr. McDonough and said: 
</p>
<p>"I am very glad to see you, sir, for I want to learn some-
</p>
<p>thing of Shakespeare. I don't get much time to study his
</p>
<p>writings, and I want to put some questions to you that I
</p>
<p>put to Mr. Hackett. I will tell you, frankly, that Mr. Ilack-
</p>
<p>ett's replies, on one or two of the points, were very unsatis-
</p>
<p>factory to me ; they almost impressed me with a doubt as to
</p>
<p>whether he studies Shakespeare thoroughly, or only the acting
</p>
<p>plays."
</p>
<p>Pulsing from his seat, he went to a shelf, and took down
</p>
<p>his volumes of Shakespeare. Having found the passage, in
</p>
<p>"Henry "IV." about which he desired to inquire, he read
</p>
<p>a portion of it, and said to Mr. McDonough, " Can you tell
</p>
<p>me why that is omitted from the acting play? There is
</p>
<p>nothing in all Shakespeare  certainly nothing in 'Henry IV.'
</p>
<p>or the ' Merry Wives of Windsor'  that equals it in wit and
</p>
<p>humor." Mr. McDonough gave him what he believed to be

</p>
<p>his reasons  those which were conclusive with him.
</p>
<p>OP ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 157
</p>
<p>The President said:  "Those are more satisfactory than Mr.
</p>
<p>Hackett's reasons, but they do not entirely satisfy me." Then
</p>
<p>turning to my friend Mr. Miller, he said:  " Probably you
</p>
<p>do not know that the acting plays are not the plays as
</p>
<p>Shakespeare wrote them. ' Richard III.,' for instance, begins
</p>
<p>with passages from 'Henry VI.; ' then you get a portion of
</p>
<p>'Richard III.;' then more of 'Henry VI.;' and then there
</p>
<p>is one of the best known soliloques, which is not Shakes-
</p>
<p>peare's at all, but was written by quite another man  by
</p>
<p>Colley Gibber  was it not, Mr. McDonough? "
</p>
<p>Branching off from Shakespeare, Mr. Lincoln cited brief
</p>
<p>passages from Byron, Rogers, Campbell, Moore, and I think
</p>
<p>a short one from Shelley, always running a 'parallel between
</p>
<p>the passage he quoted and some passage or scene in Shake-
</p>
<p>speare. Finally he said:  " But there is a great deal of very
</p>
<p>fine poetry floating about anonymously. There is one poem
</p>
<p>that is almost continually pi'esent with me ; it crosses my
</p>
<p>mind whenever I have relief from thought and care." He then
</p>
<p>recited some verses of the poem, which Mr. Carpenter was for-
</p>
<p>tunate enough to indite from his lips: 
</p>
<p>OH, WHT SHOULD THE SPIRIT OF MORTAL BE PROUD.
</p>
<p>Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud ?
</p>
<p>Like a swift, fleeting meteor, a fast flying cloud,
</p>
<p>A flash of tho lightning, a break of the wave,
</p>
<p>He passeth from life to his rest in the grave.

<p>The leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade,
</p>
<p>Be scattered around and together be laid ;
</p>
<p>And the young and the old, and the low and the high,
</p>
<p>Shall moulder to dust and together shall lie.

<p>The infant a mother attended and loved,
</p>
<p>The mother that infant's aflection who proved ;
</p>
<p>The husband that mother and infant who blessed.
</p>
<p>Each, all, are away to their dwellings of rest.

<p>In the memorial addresses, delivered in Chicago, on the
</p>
<p>character of Abraham Lincoln, Mr. Colfax, of Indiana, re-
</p>
<p>lated of the late President the following :
</p>
<p>One morning, over two years ago, calling upon him on
</p>
<p>business, I found him looking more than usually pale and
</p>
<p>careworn, and inquired the reason. He replied that the bad
</p>
<p>news he had received at a late hour the previous night,
</p>
<p>which had not yet been communicated to the press, adding
</p>
<p>that he had not closed his eyes or breakfasted ; and; with an
</p>
<p>expression I never shall forget, he exclaimed ; "How willing-
</p>
<p>ly would I exchange places to-day, with the soldier who
</p>
<p>sleeps on the ground in the Army of the Potomac."
</p>
<p>No one could ever convince the President that he was in

</p>
<p>danger of violent death. Judging others by himself, he
</p>
<p>160 LIFE AND MARTYRDOM
</p>
<p>oould not realize that any one could seek his blood. Or he
</p>
<p>may have believed as Napoleon wrote to Jerome, that no
</p>
<p>public man could eiFectually shield himself from the danger
</p>
<p>of assassination. Easier of access to the public at large
</p>
<p>than had been any of his predecessors, admitting his bit-
</p>
<p>terest enemies to his reception rooms, alone ; restive under
</p>
<p>the cavalry escort which Secretary Stanton insisted should
</p>
<p>accompany him last summer, in his daily journeys between
</p>
<p>the White House and his summer residence, at the Soldier's
</p>
<p>Home, several miles from Washington, at a time, too, as
</p>
<p>since ascertained in the details of this long organized plot,
</p>
<p>discovered since his death, when it was intended to gag and
</p>
<p>hand-cuff him, and to carry him to the rebel capitol as a
</p>
<p>hostage for their recognition ; sometimes escaping from their
</p>
<p>escort, by anticipating their usual hour of attendance ; walk-
</p>
<p>ing about the gardens unattended ; he could not be persuad-
</p>
<p>ed that he ran any risk whatever. Being at City Point af-
</p>
<p>ter the evacuation of Kichmond, he determined to go thither,
</p>
<p>not from idle curiosity, but to see if he could not do some-
</p>
<p>thing to stop the effusion of blood, and hasten the peace
</p>
<p>for which he longed.
</p>
<p>The ever watchful Secretary of War hearing of it, im-
</p>
<p>plored him, by telegraph, not to go, and warned him that
</p>
<p>some lurking assassin might take his life. But, armed with
</p>
<p>his good intentions  alas, how feeble a shield they proved
</p>
<p>against the death-blow afterward  he went, walked fearlessly
</p>
<p>and carelessly through the streets  met and conferred with a
</p>
<p>rebel leader, who had remained there ; and when he returned
</p>
<p>to City Point, telegraphed to his faithful friend and consti-

</p>
<p>that time, for his life, "I received your dispatch last night,
</p>
<p>went to Richmond this morning, and have just returned 
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln." When I told him, on that last night,
</p>
<p>how uneasy all had been at his going, he replied, pleasantly
</p>
<p>and with a smile, (I quote his exact words): " Why if any
</p>
<p>one else had been President and gone to Eichmond, I would
</p>
<p>have oeen alarmed too; but I was not scared about myself
</p>
<p>a bit." If any of you have ever been at Washington, you
</p>
<p>will remember the foot-path lined and embowered with trees
</p>
<p>leading from the back door of the War Department to the
</p>
<p>White House. One night and but recently, too, when in his
</p>
<p>anxiety for news from the army, he had been with the Sec-
</p>
<p>retary in the telegraph oJfice of the department, he was
</p>
<p>starting home at a late hour by this short route. Mr. Stan-
</p>
<p>ton stopped him and said, "You ought not to go that way ;
</p>
<p>i.. is dangerous for you even in the daytime, but worse at
</p>
<p>night." Mr. Lincoln replied, " I don't believe there's any
</p>
<p>danger there, day or night." Mr. Stanton replied solemnly,
</p>
<p>"Well, Mr. President, you shall not be killed returning that way
</p>
<p>from my department while I am in it ; you must let me take
</p>
<p>you round by the avenue in my carriage." And Mr. Lin-
</p>
<p>coln joining the Secretary on his imperious military ordeta
</p>
<p>and his needless alarm on his account, as he called it, en-
</p>
<p>tered the carriage and was driven by the well-lighted avenue

<p>ABRAHAM LINCOLN AN ODE.
</p>
<p>A noble poem, by R. H. Stoddard, entitled "Abraham Lin-
</p>
<p>coln, an Oration Ode," has just been published in New York.
</p>
<p>The following stanzas describe the funeral procession through
</p>
<p>the States, and are worthy the great occasion :
</p>
<p>Peace 1 Let the long procession come
</p>
<p>For hark !  the mournful mufflled drum 
</p>
<p>The trumpet's wail afar 
</p>
<p>And see I the awful Car 1
</p>
<p>Peace I Let the sad procession go,
</p>
<p>While cannon boom, and bells toll slow;
</p>
<p>And go, thou sacred Car,
</p>
<p>Bearing our Woe afar 1
</p>
<p>Go, darkly borne, from State to State,
</p>
<p>Whose, loyal, sorrowing cities wait
</p>
<p>To honor all they can
</p>
<p>The dust of that Good Man 1
</p>
<p>Go, grandly borne, with such a train
</p>
<p>As greatest kings might die to gain ;
</p>
<p>The Just, the Wise, the Brave
</p>
<p>Attend thee to the grave !
</p>
<p>And you, the soldiers of our wars,
</p>
<p>Bronzed veterans, grim with noble scars,
</p>
<p>Salute him once again.
</p>
<p>Your late Commander  slain I
</p>
<p>Yes, let your tears, indignant, fall.

<p>But leave your muskets on the wall ;

<p>Your Country need^ you now
