<p>of the subject embraced in the last chapter of this vindication,

<p>taken from high authority : I mean the conduct of the Pro-
</p>

</p>
<p>execrable code " to prevent the growth of Popery"

</p>
<p>much on account of religion"]
</p>
<p>" We found the people heretics and idolaters ; we have, by

<p>beggars. They remain in all the misfortune of their old

<p>errors, and all the superadded misery of their recent punish-
</p>
<p>ment."\.
</p>
<p>" They divided the nation into two distinct parties, without
</p>
<p>common interest, sympathy, or connexion. One of these bodies
</p>
<p>was to possess all the franchises, all the property, all the edu-
</p>
<p>cation. The other was to be composed of drarvers of w^ater
</p>
<p>and cutters of turf for them."
</p>
<p>" Every measure was pleasing and popular, just in propor-

<p>tion as it tended to harass and ruin a set of people -who were
</p>
<p>looked upon as enemies to God and man; and indeed as a race of
</p>
<p>bigoted savages, rvho were a disgrace to human nature itself"^
</p>
<p>The code against the Roman Catholics " was a machine of

<p>wise and elaborate contrivance ; and as well fitted for the op-

<p>pression, impoverishment, and degradation of a people, and the

<p>degraded."**

<p>t Review of some Interesting Periods of Irish History, 36.
</p>
<p>TO most readers it will probably appear ex-
</p>
<p>traordinary, and a work of supererogation, that,
</p>
<p>in a country and an age so remote from the scene
</p>
<p>and the era of the events which are discussed in
</p>
<p>this vindication, it should be deemed either proper
</p>
<p>or necessary to investigate the subjects it em-
</p>
<p>braces. The reasons are powerful, and fully
</p>
<p>justify the undertaking.
</p>
<p>The history of Ireland, as stated and proved
</p>
<p>in the body of this work, is almost one solid mass
</p>
<p>of falsehood and imposture, erected, particularly
</p>
<p>during the seventeenth century, on the basis of
</p>
<p>fraud and perjury ; fraud and perjury so obvious,
</p>
<p>so stupid, and so flagitious, that, to the most
</p>
<p>superficial observer, it must be a subject of inex-
</p>
<p>pressible astonishment how it ever gained cur-
</p>
<p>rency.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, from such foul and polluted
</p>
<p>sources alone, the knowledge of Irish history is
</p>
<p>derived by nine-tenths of those who have conde-
</p>
<p>scended to study it : and, though it may appear
</p>
<p>extravagant, it is nevertheless a serious truth, that

</p>
<p>a large portion even of those who pride them-
</p>
<p>selves on their literary acquirements, are almost
</p>
<p>as ignorant of the affairs of Ireland, from the
</p>
<p>twelfth to the eighteenth century, as they are of
</p>
<p>those of the Arabians or Japanese. They are, in
</p>
<p>fact, in a worse state. With respect to the history
</p>
<p>of the Arabians and Japanese, they are barely
</p>
<p>ignorant : but, with respect to Ireland, almost all
</p>
<p>they know is whoEy untrue. They give full faith
</p>
<p>and confidence to some of the most extravagant
</p>
<p>and romantic stories that ever were ushered on
</p>
<p>the world, to delude and deceive mankind, under
</p>
<p>the prostituted name of histories.
</p>
<p>The terrific tales that are recorded of the
</p>
<p>events of the civil war of 1641, have sowed, and
</p>
<p>still continue to sow, a copious seed of the most
</p>
<p>vulgar and rancorous prejudices in the mind of
</p>
<p>man against his fellow man, which have sprout-
</p>
<p>ed forth with most pernicious luxuriance, and
</p>
<p>soured in his breast the sweet milk of human
</p>
<p>kindness towards those with whom he is in daily
</p>
<p>habits of association. These prejudices are too
</p>
<p>generally prevalent in the British dominions.
</p>
<p>In Ireland, they have produced the most baleful
</p>
<p>consequences, and still afford some sort of coun-
</p>
<p>tenance to the continuance of the remnant of
</p>
<p>an odious code of laws, by which, as appeal's in
</p>
<p>Chapter XXI. of this work,* rapine, cruelty, and
</p>
<p>demoralization have been legally systematized,

<p>and every principle of honour, honesty, good
</p>
<p>faith, justice, and sound policy, violated.
</p>
<p>Many of these prejudices have been transplant-
</p>
<p>ed from their native soil by emigrants, and have
</p>
<p>taken root in this country, notwithstanding the
</p>
<p>general liberality of the age. It is true, however,
</p>
<p>that their range is confined, and their influence
</p>
<p>inconsiderable. Nevertheless, the erroneous im-
</p>
<p>pressions respecting Irish affairs, are, we repeat,
</p>
<p>universal here, from the corrupt sources whence
</p>
<p>her heart-rending story is derived.
</p>
<p>Should it, therefore, be asked, why I have
</p>
<p>taken the trouble to explore the musty vo-
</p>
<p>lumes whence I have drawn the materials for
</p>
<p>this work ? I reply, I have had three motives :
</p>
<p>the pleasure of detecting and exposing fraud and
</p>
<p>imposture ; the vindication of my native coun-
</p>
<p>try ; and the fond hope, that there are in the
</p>
<p>United States thousands and tens of thousands
</p>
<p>of liberal and enlightened men, who only require
</p>
<p>to have the fair and holy form of Truth placed
</p>
<p>before their eyes, properly authenticated, to in-
</p>
<p>duce them to clasp her to their bosoms. For
</p>
<p>such I write: and there is a large fund of
</p>
<p>consolation and encouragement to be derived
</p>
<p>from the consideration, that I address a public
</p>
<p>which has not any sordid motives of self-interest
</p>
<p>to impel it to uphold the cause of imposture.
</p>
<p>There is here no Protestant, nor Presbyterian,
</p>
<p>nor Quaker, nor Catholic, nor Universalist ascen-
</p>
<p>dency, whose power is built on the pestiferous

<p>basis of fraud, perjury, and misrepresentation.
</p>
<p>Xll PREFACE.
</p>
<p>Tliis is an inestimable advantage, which writers
</p>
<p>on this subject, in the British dominions, cannot
</p>
<p>enjoy to the same extent. The power, influence,
</p>
<p>and ascendency of the "sacred cast," the Irish
</p>
<p>oligarchs who uphold the despotism of a domi-
</p>
<p>nant and domineering ecclesiastical establish-
</p>
<p>ment, which, to compensate them for their ser-
</p>
<p>vices, ensures them the undisturbed possession
</p>
<p>of all the honours and emoluments of society,
</p>
<p>would fall prostrate at the touch of the talisman
</p>
<p>of truth, as the gorgeous fabric of Aladdin's
</p>
<p>palace fell at the touch of the wand of the
</p>
<p>genius : and therefore, how disgraceful soever it
</p>
<p>may be to human nature, it is not wonderful,
</p>
<p>considering the weakness, the wickedness, and
</p>
<p>the selfishness of mankind, that so much pains
</p>
<p>should have been and are taken to stifle the
</p>
<p>voice of injurious truth, and to perpetuate the
</p>
<p>reign of productive and lucrative imposture.
</p>
<p>Some gentlemen have exclaimed against this
</p>
<p>undertaking, as highly pernicious, and calculated
</p>
<p>to revive ancient prejudices and excite hostility
</p>
<p>between different denominations of Christians,
</p>
<p>and between the natives of the two British islands.
</p>
<p>Charity induces me to hope, that those who raise
</p>
<p>these objections are deceived, not deceivers,
</p>
<p>that they believe what they profess. But that
</p>
<p>their impressions, if ingenuous, arise from a very
</p>
<p>contracted view of the subject, may be made as
</p>
<p>clear as any axiom in morals or politics.
</p>
<p>There might be some plausibility in these ob-

</p>
<p>undertaken to expose and refute, sunk into obli-
</p>
<p>vion, and their influence wholly ceased to operate.
</p>
<p>But they have unfortunately survived the causes
</p>
<p>which gave them birth; become engrafted in
</p>
<p>history ; taken complete possession of the public
</p>
<p>mind ; and are almost as thoroughly and as uni-
</p>
<p>versally believed, as the best established facts in
</p>
<p>the annals of the world. Can the man, then,
</p>
<p>who honestly endeavours to demolish the fabric
</p>
<p>of deception, arid, by this demolition, eradicate
</p>
<p>the angry passions which it has engendered, be
</p>
<p>regarded otherwise than as engaged in a laudable
</p>
<p>warfare, the warfare of holy truth against impi-
</p>
<p>ous imposture ? Do not those who labour to pre-
</p>
<p>vent the success of such an undertaking, uphold
</p>
<p>the cause of fraud and delusion ?
</p>
<p>Having stated the motives to this undertaking,
</p>
<p>I submit to the consideration of the reader the
</p>
<p>several points which I have laboured, and I trust
</p>
<p>successfully, to establish. That they are of vital
</p>
<p>importance, and that, if proved, they invalidate a
</p>
<p>large portion of the history of Ireland, as narrated
</p>
<p>by Temple, Borlase, Carte, Warner, Leland,
</p>
<p>Hume, and others, will appear obvious, on a
</p>
<p>slight perusal. This consideration entitles them
</p>
<p>to a sober, serious examination.
</p>
<p>It is not, by any means, pretended that they
</p>
<p>are discussed systematically, in the order in which
</p>
<p>they are here arranged. The proofs are dispersed
</p>
<p>throughout the work, and, notwithstanding their
</p>
<p>want of arrangement, cannot, I hope, fail to satisfy

<p>every candid mind,
</p>
<p>XIV PREFACE.
</p>
<p>I. That the statement given by Temple, Cla-
</p>
<p>rendon, Warner, Leland, and all the other writers
</p>
<p>on the affairs of Ireland, that the Irish, for forty
</p>
<p>years previous to the insurrection of 1641, enjoy-
</p>
<p>ed a high degree of peace, security, happiness,
</p>
<p>and toleration, is as base and shameful a false-
</p>
<p>hood as ever disgraced the pages of history, and
</p>
<p>is no more like the real state of the case, than the
</p>
<p>history of St. George and the dragon is like the
</p>
<p>true history of England. For
</p>
<p>II. That, during this period, there was hardly
</p>
<p>a Catholic in the kingdom who was secure in the
</p>
<p>possession of his property, or in the exercise of
</p>
<p>his religion. And
</p>
<p>III. That, during the same period, the Irish
</p>
<p>were plundered by the government -of nearly a
</p>
<p>million of acres of their lands, in the most wicked,
</p>
<p>unjust and perfidious manner ; and by rapacious
</p>
<p>individuals, to an extent beyond calculation.
</p>
<p>IV. That O'Conally's pretended discovery of a
</p>
<p>conspiracy, is one unvaried strain of perjury.
</p>
<p>V. That there was no conspiracy for a general
</p>
<p>insurrection in Ireland, on the 23d October, 1641.
</p>
<p>VI. That the basis on which rests the story of
</p>
<p>the pretended bloody massacre by the Irish, is a
</p>
<p>tissue of the most gross and palpable falsehood
</p>
<p>and perjury. On the contrary,
</p>
<p>VII. That the massacres perpetrated on the
</p>
<p>Irish, by St. Leger, Monroe, Tichbourne, Hamil-
</p>
<p>ton, Grenville, Ireton, and Cromwell, were as
</p>
<p>savage, as ferocious, as brutal, and as bloody, as

</p>
<p>the horrible feats of Cortes or Pizarro, Attila or
</p>
<p>PREFACE. XV
</p>
<p>Genghis Khan ; and particularly, that history pre-
</p>
<p>sents nothing more shocking or detestable than
</p>
<p>Ireton's butchery in the cathedral of Cashell, and
</p>
<p>Cromwell's in Drogheda.
</p>
<p>VIII. That the Irish government issued a blood-
</p>
<p>thirsty and detestable order to slaughter " all men
</p>
<p>able to bear arms, in places where the insurgents
</p>
<p>were harboured," without any discrimination be-
</p>
<p>tween the innocent and guilty; that the Long
</p>
<p>Parliament enacted an ordinance, " forbidding
</p>
<p>quarter to be given to any Irishman taken pri-
</p>
<p>soner in England;" and that those cruel and
</p>
<p>wicked edicts were carried into operation.
</p>
<p>IX. That the scheme of a general extirpation
</p>
<p>of the Irish, as general a confiscation of their
</p>
<p>estates, and a new plantation of the country, was
</p>
<p>most seriously entertained, and for some time
</p>
<p>acted upon, by the Irish rulers and their officers.
</p>
<p>X. That the idea of a cessation of hostilities,
</p>
<p>whereby the Irish might escape from this pro-
</p>
<p>jected plan of extirpation, excited as universal an
</p>
<p>alarm in England and Ireland, as if the established
</p>
<p>religion and government were to be wholly over-
</p>
<p>turned.
</p>
<p>XI. That the Irish government left nothing
</p>
<p>barbarous, cruel, or wicked, undone, to goad the
</p>
<p>Irish to resistance, and to extend the insurrection
</p>
<p>throughout the kingdom, for the purpose of en-
</p>
<p>riching themselves and their friends by confisca-

</p>
<p>tions.
</p>
<p>XVI PREFACE.
</p>
<p>XII. That if the Irish insurgents of 1641 deserv-
</p>
<p>ed to be stigmatized as traitors and rebels, then
</p>
<p>were the English revolutionists of 1688, the Ame-
</p>
<p>rican of 1776, and the French of 1789, traitors
</p>
<p>and rebels of the very worst possible kind ; as
</p>
<p>their grievances bore no more proportion to
</p>
<p>those of the Irish, than the gentle Schuylkill to
</p>
<p>the impetuous Mississippi, the hill of Howth to
</p>
<p>the peak of Teneriffe, or lake Erie to the Atlantic
</p>
<p>ocean.
</p>
<p>XIII. That there is a striking contradiction be-
</p>
<p>tween the facts and inductions of Carte, Warner,
</p>
<p>Leland, and nearly all the other writers of Irish
</p>
<p>history.
</p>
<p>XIV. That, in the Anglo-Hibernian histories of
</p>
<p>Ireland, there is so much error and falsehood,
</p>
<p>established beyond the possibility of doubt or
</p>
<p>denial, that they are utterly unworthy of credit.
</p>
<p>XV. That the seventeenth century, in the Bri-
</p>
<p>tish dominions, was characterized by a succes-
</p>
<p>sion of forged plots, resting on the basis of fla-
</p>
<p>grant perjuries, arid calculated to sacrifice the
</p>
<p>lives and property of the innocent, and enrich
</p>
<p>malefactors of the worst kind.
</p>
<p>XVI. That the Irish code of laws, whose pre-
</p>
<p>tended object was "to prevent the growth of
</p>
<p>Popery," was intended to gratify all the basest
</p>
<p>passions of human nature, in violation of public
</p>
<p>faith, honour, justice, and humanity ; and that it

<p>organized as tyrannical an invasion of liberty, and

<p>PREFACE. XV11
</p>
<p>as piratical a depredation on property, and was
</p>
<p>covered by as base a cloak of hypocrisy, as the
</p>
<p>annals of the world can produce.
</p>
<p>I fondly flatter myself, I repeat, that the proofs
</p>
<p>I have adduced fully establish the whole of these
</p>
<p>points. But should I be too sanguine in this ex-
</p>
<p>pectation, I still trust that I shall secure the assent
</p>
<p>of liberal and ingenuous minds to all the essential
</p>
<p>ones. Against the fortresses of fraud and impos-
</p>
<p>ture, I have brought a battery of eight-arid-forty
</p>
<p>pounders, which can hardly fail to demolish them.
</p>
<p>The arsenals of enemies, some of them most
</p>
<p>envenomed, have furnished all the cannon. The
</p>
<p>laborious and unwearied research for them, and
</p>
<p>their mere disposition and arrangement, are all
</p>
<p>the merit I claim.
</p>
<p>It would be a most fastidious and hypercritical
</p>
<p>delicacy, that should preclude a writer from fairly
</p>
<p>stating the merits of, and obviating objections to,
</p>
<p>his materials, or the authorities on which he relies
</p>
<p>to support his narrative, if he write history ; or
</p>
<p>his discussions, if he investigate historical facts.
</p>
<p>I neither feel myself, nor fear in my readers, any
</p>
<p>such delicacy. I therefore treat on the materials
</p>
<p>of this publication, as I should on those of any
</p>
<p>other whatsoever.
</p>
<p>I feel confident that there is probably no
</p>
<p>historical work extant, that rests on stronger
</p>
<p>grounds. I am not aware of a single fact of
</p>
<p>importance, throughout the whole, that is not

<p>Dr. Curry, in his invaluable work, the " Histo-
</p>
<p>rical .and Critical Review of the Civil Wars in
</p>
<p>Ireland," has set a laudable example in this depart-
</p>
<p>ment of literature. He has, in most cases, esta-
</p>
<p>blished his facts by copious quotations. I have
</p>
<p>not merely followed, but have gone beyond his
</p>
<p>example. I have been more general in my quo-
</p>
<p>tations; and have but slenderly availed myself
</p>
<p>of the Irish writers : whereas a large portion of
</p>
<p>his authorities are of that description; and, al-
</p>
<p>though they are in themselves perfectly sound and
</p>
<p>unexceptionable, yet they are liable to cavil, for
</p>
<p>which I was determined to afford no pretext what-
</p>
<p>ever. On such a question, Irish authorities would
</p>
<p>not have sufficient weight with minds devoured
</p>
<p>by prejudice ; and would come before the world
</p>
<p>in a questionable form, and subject to suspicions
</p>
<p>of partiality. I have therefore almost wholly
</p>
<p>rejected them throughout ; so that, jn about five
</p>
<p>hundred quotations, there are not a dozen from
</p>
<p>writers of that class : and, in one of the most im-
</p>
<p>portant chapters of the book, that on the subject
</p>
<p>of the massacres and murders perpetrated on the
</p>
<p>Irish, I have not made use of a single one of their
</p>
<p>advocates. In this respect, I believe the work
</p>
<p>rests on the most impregnable foundation ; and

<p>am persuaded no similar instance ever occurred.

<p>PREFACE. XIX
</p>
<p>My heart swells with a glow of satisfaction
</p>
<p>and pride, that I can come before the critical
</p>
<p>world, with a defence of Ireland, resting on the
</p>
<p>names of Spencer, Davies, Coke, Temple, Borlase,
</p>
<p>Clarendon, Rush worth, Nalson, Carte, Warner,
</p>
<p>Leland, Baker, Orrery, ^c. nearly all of whom
</p>
<p>were open or concealed enemies of that country
</p>
<p>and its unfortunate inhabitants. It may seem
</p>
<p>extraordinary, that there is on the list the name
</p>
<p>of the wretched Temple, who, as I have shown,*
</p>
<p>was so far ashamed of his own spurious work,
</p>
<p>that he endeavoured, but in vain, to suppress it :
</p>
<p>but it is the peculiar felicity of this undertaking,
</p>
<p>that it may be fairly said to this father of all the
</p>
<p>imposture,
</p>
<p>" By thy words thou shalt be condemned."
</p>
<p>for, were all the other authorities, cited in this
</p>
<p>work, totally annihilated, there is enough in this
</p>
<p>legendist to demolish the fabric of fraud and de-
</p>
<p>ception, in the erection of which, so much time,
</p>
<p>and such varied talents, have been prostituted,
</p>
<p>for a hundred and fifty years past.
</p>
<p>Having stated the motives to this undertaking ;
</p>
<p>the points I have endeavoured to prove ; and the
</p>
<p>materials I have employed, it remains to render
</p>
<p>some account of the execution of the plan : and
</p>
<p>here I confess I feel myself open to censure,
</p>
<p>from which I shall not attempt to shrink. The
</p>
<p>work is in a very imperfect state indeed ; and

<p>has not had a due share of attention bestowed on
</p>
<p>it. Whether, by any degree of time and labour,
</p>
<p>I could have rendered it complete and perfect,
</p>
<p>I am very doubtful. But this is certain, that I
</p>
<p>might have made it far less imperfect, had I de-
</p>
<p>voted more time to it. The great body of it has
</p>
<p>been written at night, when the pressure of usual
</p>
<p>avocations had subsided ; and next day hastily
</p>
<p>committed to the press, under all the consequent
</p>
<p>disadvantages.
</p>
<p>This statement is the offspring, not of ostenta-
</p>
<p>tion, but of a due regard to truth, and in the faint
</p>
<p>hope that it will operate as some sort of apology
</p>
<p>for the manifest imperfections of the work. I
</p>
<p>am not, however, unaware, that, in strict justice,
</p>
<p>this avowal may be considered as rendering those
</p>
<p>imperfections more unpardonable ; as it may with
</p>
<p>truth be said, that no man has a right to present
</p>
<p>his productions to the world, without due prepa-
</p>
<p>ration ; that it is disrespectful, and deserves severe
</p>
<p>censure : in a word, that the haste with which
</p>
<p>this vindication has been composed and hurried
</p>
<p>through the press, so far from being an extenu-
</p>
<p>ation, is an aggravation of the offence.
</p>
<p>The correctness of these objections cannot be
</p>
<p>denied. But let it sink deep into the mind of
</p>
<p>the reader, that, whatever I may suffer from the
</p>
<p>justice, or even the utmost rigour, of criticism,
</p>
<p>is unimportant, compared with what I feel from
</p>
<p>the convictions of my own mind. I stand self-

<p>to pine in the most abject poverty, wretchedness,

<p>and every clime of the known world, have dis-

<p>which has furnished almost every nation in Chris-

<p>which has produced the men on whom the desti-
</p>
<p>nies of Europe have recently depended, in the
</p>
<p>field and in the cabinet ; a country the most ca-
</p>
<p>lumniated, and among the most oppressed, in the
</p>
<p>world ; having as fair a field to explore as ever
</p>
<p>courted the exertions of any writer, in any age or
</p>
<p>any country, I most deeply regret, and sincerely
</p>
<p>apologize for, the want of judgment which led
</p>
<p>me to appear precipitately before the public, with-
</p>
<p>out that degree of elaboration which the impor-
</p>
<p>tance of the subject demanded.
</p>
<p>Having candidly avowed thus much with re-
</p>
<p>spect to the execution of the work, I trust I
</p>
<p>shall not be censured for expressing a hope, that
</p>
<p>there is, in the object I have had in view ; the
</p>
<p>glorious cause I have undertaken ; and the im-
</p>
<p>pregnable basis on which this vindication rests,
</p>
<p>a redeeming virtue, that would atone for defects
</p>
<p>and imperfections infinitely greater than those to
</p>
<p>be found in these pages. He must be a most
</p>
<p>fastidious epicure, who, when hungry, would turn
</p>
<p>in scorn from excellent viands, merely because
</p>
<p>the traiteur had been injudicious or inexpert in
</p>
<p>the cookery: and the reader would be equally
</p>
<p>injudicious, who should reject a work which

</p>
<p>shed the broad glare of truth on an important
</p>
<p>and much-misrepresented period of history, mere-
</p>
<p>ly because, from want of skill, or want of leisure,
</p>
<p>or perhaps both, the writer had failed in the
</p>
<p>arrangement of his materials.
</p>
<p>Some readers may complain, that the quota-
</p>
<p>tions are too numerous ; that they disfigure the
</p>
<p>appearance of the work ; and unnecessarily en-
</p>
<p>hance its volume : and some may be unjust
</p>
<p>enough to believe that the latter is one of the
</p>
<p>objects of the writer.
</p>
<p>Whoever entertains this idea must be grossly
</p>
<p>ignorant of the nature of writing. He has never
</p>
<p>tried the experiment. The search for some of
</p>
<p>those passages, which do not exceed three or four
</p>
<p>lines, has cost more time and labour than have
</p>
<p>been employed in writing five or six pages. In
</p>
<p>fact, the time wasted in examining the dry and
</p>
<p>dreary details of a soporific volume of Thurloe's
</p>
<p>State Papers, of eight or nine hundred pages,
</p>
<p>where hardly a single fact was to be gleaned,
</p>
<p>would have sufficed for writing a chapter of ori-
</p>
<p>ginal matter.
</p>
<p>In some cases, however, I have probably
</p>
<p>given more quotations than were necessary : but
</p>
<p>this error is venial. Those who are satisfied
</p>
<p>with one or two authorities, out of six or eight,
</p>
<p>may pass over the remainder : whereas the con-
</p>
<p>trary and common error, of affording slender
</p>
<p>support to what we are ourselves, and suppose

<p>others, convinced of. is a vital one. A single
</p>
<p>XXIV PREFACE.
</p>
<p>instance of the latter is productive of more inju-
</p>
<p>rious consequences than twenty of the former.
</p>
<p>For the exuberance of quotations, an adequate
</p>
<p>reason can be given. In the gross adulteration
</p>
<p>of Irish history, which we have had occasion so
</p>
<p>often to present to the reader, it requires no
</p>
<p>ordinary weight of proof, to make an impression
</p>
<p>on the public mind, on points wherein error is
</p>
<p>so gross, truth so little known, means of correct
</p>
<p>information so limited, and prejudice so inve-
</p>
<p>terate.
</p>
<p>Of what avail would it be, had I written a
</p>
<p>narrative of the events discussed in this work,
</p>
<p>even with a long series of references to my
</p>
<p>authorities ? Who, to verify the facts, would
</p>
<p>take the pains to explore Temple, and Borlase,
</p>
<p>and Rushworth, and Baker, and Clarendon, and
</p>
<p>Carte, and Leland, and Warner, and so many
</p>
<p>other writers whom I have quoted ? Not one
</p>
<p>in a hundred. The facts would be regarded as
</p>
<p>resting on the writer's mere ipse dixit ; and would
</p>
<p>wholly fail to produce the effect intended, and
</p>
<p>which I trust the work will produce. But lives
</p>
<p>there a man who will dare to refuse his assent,
</p>
<p>when I quote Ludlow, for the butchery at Cash-
</p>
<p>el ; the marquis of Ormond, and Cromwell him-
</p>
<p>self, for that at Drogheda ; Borlase, for the star-
</p>
<p>vation of "7,000 of the vulgar sort," by one
</p>
<p>regiment ; Rushworth, for the bloodthirsty decree
</p>
<p>of the Long Parliament, " to give no quarter to

</p>
<p>selves, for the murderous order to " kill every
</p>
<p>man able to bear arms, in those places where
</p>
<p>rebels were harboured ?"
</p>
<p>On this subject I desire to be distinctly under-
</p>
<p>stood. Though literary reputation, to every man
</p>
<p>who employs his pen for the public, must be
</p>
<p>a desirable object ; yet I should be more highly
</p>
<p>gratified, were this vindication a mere collection
</p>
<p>of " shreds and patches," without a single page
</p>
<p>of my own composition, and in which my sole
</p>
<p>merit would arise from the research for, and
</p>
<p>arrangement of, facts, forcing conviction on the
</p>
<p>reader's mind, than if it united the manly bold-
</p>
<p>ness of Tacitus with the elaborate elegance of
</p>
<p>Gibbon, (if those qualities be not incompatible)
</p>
<p>but were as deceptious and fraudulent as Cla-
</p>
<p>rendon's account of the state of Ireland pre-
</p>
<p>vious to 1641, or Hume's of the insurrection of
</p>
<p>that year. Wretched,, indeed, and meriting pity
</p>
<p>and contempt, must be the man who could hesi-
</p>
<p>tate for a moment between the two results of his
</p>
<p>labours.
</p>
<p>In following the track of such an indefatigable
</p>
<p>writer as Curry, who has almost exhausted the
</p>
<p>sickening subject, it would be hardly possible to
</p>
<p>avoid using the same materials, and frequently
</p>
<p>making analogous dispositions of, and deductions
</p>
<p>from, them. This is the fate of every writer who
</p>
<p>travels over ground already beaten. A man who
</p>
<p>writes history, or discusses historical subjects, of

</p>
<p>than as he narrates facts already recorded. Inven-
</p>
<p>tion and fraud are synonymous terms. All that
</p>
<p>remain for modern writers, who treat of remote
</p>
<p>events, are, laborious research : judicious selection
</p>
<p>of materials ; fidelity of quotation ; and correct
</p>
<p>induction. How far I have succeeded with the
</p>
<p>second and fourth, the world will decide : but to
</p>
<p>the first and third I fearlessly lay claim. I have
</p>
<p>spared neither pains nor expense in procuring the
</p>
<p>necessary materials, nor time nor labour in their
</p>
<p>examination. Almost every book in the Philadel-
</p>
<p>phia library, bearing on this subject, (and the
</p>
<p>number is immense) I have examined; and more-
</p>
<p>over procured many, which it does not contain,
</p>
<p>from New York, Baltimore, and Burlington.*
</p>
<p>* It is not pretended, that I have read all the books I
</p>
<p>have quoted. Half a life would hardly be adequate to this
</p>
<p>purpose. No man of business could read Thurloe and Rush-
</p>
<p>worth, amounting to fifteen ponderous folios, in less than two
</p>
<p>or three years. But four-fifths of the books to which I have
</p>
<p>referred, and many which were too barren to afford a single
</p>
<p>passage, I have examined page by page. Others have been
</p>
<p>more slightly searched ; and of some, only certain volumes, on
</p>
<p>cotemporaneous events. Those accustomed to investigations
</p>
<p>of this kind, know that a single glance will frequently suf-
</p>
<p>fice to ascertain whether a page be likely to furnish suitable
</p>
<p>matter. This has been remarkably the case with Thurloe,
</p>
<p>Rushworth and Clarendon. Temple, Carte, Warner, Leland,
</p>
<p>and some others, who have furnished the principal part of my
</p>
<p>materials, required a closer examination, which they have
</p>
<p>accordingly received. But of the matter suitable for my pur-
</p>
<p>pose, even in these works, a large portion must have wholly
</p>
<p>escaped me, from the rapidity of my researches. Moreover,
</p>
<p>of my selections, I have not been able to avail myself of more

<p>than one-fourth part, in consequence of the limits I prescribed
</p>
<p>to this work.
</p>
<p>PREFACE. XXVli
</p>
<p>On the subject of fidelity of quotation, I wish
</p>
<p>to state, that I have been as careful as human
</p>
<p>frailty would admit, to avoid errors : but, in the
</p>
<p>very unusual number of authorities, some may
</p>
<p>have crept in. If this be the case, I am satisfied
</p>
<p>they are few and unimportant. Should any be
</p>
<p>discovered, I shall regard the communication of
</p>
<p>them as a signal favour.
</p>
<p>I have been led to notice slightly, and merely
</p>
<p>as connected with the subject, some of the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings of the Long Parliament and of Charles I.
</p>
<p>In this, as in all other cases of civil war, there
</p>
<p>were egregious and multifarious " faults on both
</p>
<p>sides," some of which truth has called upon me
</p>
<p>to state. Zealous friends of free government,
</p>
<p>who have been nurtured in idolatry of the Long
</p>
<p>Parliament, which they regard as immaculate, will
</p>
<p>hardly pardon a writer who holds them up to
</p>
<p>execration, for their " no quarter" ordinance ; for
</p>
<p>their rancorous opposition to a cessation of arms ;
</p>
<p>and for their devouring rage for the extermination
</p>
<p>of the Irish, and the confiscation of their estates :
</p>
<p>and the idolaters of the " royal martyr" will
</p>
<p>equally denounce me, for daring to expose his
</p>
<p>base perfidy to the Irish. This result has been
</p>
<p>foreseen, and is disregarded. They may censure
</p>
<p>and abuse as much as they will : but volumes of
</p>
<p>such censure and abuse will not disprove a single
</p>
<p>fact.

<p>I met with a most excellent history of Ireland, by
</p>
<p>XXV111 PREFACE.
</p>
<p>John Lawless. Esqr. published anno 1814, where-
</p>
<p>in the writer defends his country's character and
</p>
<p>rights, in an unusually bold, eloquent, masterly,
</p>
<p>and overwhelming manner. Having derived his
</p>
<p>materials from the same sources as Curry, sources
</p>
<p>to which I also have had recourse, it is not won-
</p>
<p>derful that there should frequently be a sameness
</p>
<p>between his work and this. I am gratified to
</p>
<p>state, that there is a coincidence between his
</p>
<p>views of most of the subjects, and those I have
</p>
<p>taken, particularly with respect to the rapacity
</p>
<p>and plunder of James I. I regret, however, to
</p>
<p>find, that he has very slightly passed over the two
</p>
<p>most important points embraced in this work:
</p>
<p>I mean the account of the pretended general con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, and the legends of the massacre of 1641,
</p>
<p>which his powerful pen could have so ably ex-
</p>
<p>posed, and for the detection of which he must
</p>
<p>have had more copious materials in Dublin than
</p>
<p>I could procure in Philadelphia. This elegant
</p>
<p>and interesting history ought to be in the posses-
</p>
<p>sion of every Irishman who feels for the honour
</p>
<p>and glory of his country.
</p>
<p>The strong language of reprobation, which I
</p>
<p>have used towards the English administrations
</p>
<p>in Ireland, will probably excite the ire of some
</p>
<p>unthinking Englishmen, who may regard it as
</p>
<p>a libel on their nation. Such feelings can be
</p>
<p>entertained only by most illiberal minds. Every
</p>
<p>enlightened Englishman will sympathize in the

<p>fair a portion of the globe, and pursued a system
</p>
<p>so well adapted to eternize hostility between the
</p>
<p>two nations, and which had not a single feature
</p>
<p>calculated to secure the attachment of a people
</p>
<p>who, easily alienated by hostility, are proverbially
</p>
<p>celebrated for being as easily conciliated by kind-
</p>
<p>ness as any in the world.
</p>
<p>But the dreadful scenes exhibited in Ireland
</p>
<p>were not the result of any peculiarity in the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish nation : they arose from the relations between
</p>
<p>the two islands. Perhaps, had the case been
</p>
<p>wholly reversed, had Ireland been the master
</p>
<p>nation, Irishmen would have
</p>
<p>" Play'd such fantastic tricks before high heaven,
</p>
<p>As make e'en angels weep,"
</p>
<p>and run riot in England, as Englishmen have
</p>
<p>done in Ireland : for, if there be one truth more
</p>
<p>clearly proved by history than another, it is. that
</p>
<p>bodies of men, or nations, are demons, when they
</p>
<p>have uncontrolled power over other bodies or
</p>
<p>nations. All the oppressions, the tyrannies, the
</p>
<p>rapines, the bloody persecutions, that load the
</p>
<p>polluted and wretched annals of mankind, bear
</p>
<p>the most irrefragable evidence to this appalling
</p>
<p>position.
</p>
<p>The English, for two hundred years, have com-
</p>
<p>memorated, with horror against the Dutch, the

</p>
<p>exaggeration and falsehood : for who can allow
</p>
<p>himself to believe the tale, that "the tortured
</p>
<p>wretches were forced to drink water till their
</p>
<p>bodies were distended to the utmost pitch, and then
</p>
<p>caused to disgorge the water, and the process re-
</p>
<p>peated;" that they " were burned, from the feet
</p>
<p>upwards, in order to extort the confession of a
</p>
<p>conspiracy " that " the nails of their fingers and
</p>
<p>toes were torn off" or, finally, that " holes were
</p>
<p>made in their breasts, and the cavities filled with
</p>
<p>inflammable matter?"* No man of common
</p>
<p>sense can pay a moment's attention to it. Yet
</p>
<p>this is the precise story, as it stands recorded.
</p>
<p>A rancorous hostility prevailed between the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish and the Dutch : and it is by no means im-
</p>
<p>probable, that the conspiracy charged upon the
</p>
<p>former by the latter was real, and that the con-
</p>
<p>spirators were justly and regularly punished. All
</p>
<p>the rest of the story, I repeat, has the most mani-
</p>
<p>fest and palpable appearance of exaggeration and
</p>
<p>embellishment, contrived for the purpose of ren-
</p>
<p>dering the Dutch odious. This is the more pro-
</p>
<p>bable, from a consideration of the lying spirit of
</p>
<p>that age, of which I have given so many striking
</p>
<p>instances.
</p>
<p>But suppose the story of " the massacre of
</p>
<p>Amboyna" true ; suppose all those horrid deeds
</p>
<p>were really perpetrated : ten thousand such scenes
</p>
<p>would fall incalculably short of the sufferings in-

<p>insurrection of 1641 : and, in truth, the whole
</p>
<p>legend fades into insignificance, compared with
</p>
<p>the single fact of the butchery at Drogheda.
</p>
<p>Let any candid, fair, and honourable English-
</p>
<p>man, therefore, lay his hand on his heart, and say
</p>
<p>whether he can justify himself for censuring an
</p>
<p>Irishman for mourning over the melancholy story
</p>
<p>of his country's sufferings; for vindicating her
</p>
<p>character; and for attempting to remove the
</p>
<p>mountains of obloquy and abuse with which wick-
</p>
<p>ed men have overwhelmed her for centuries ?
</p>
<p>The Englishman feels deeply for the honour of his
</p>
<p>country. Why should he condemn, why should
</p>
<p>he not rather applaud, the same feeling in an
</p>
<p>Irishman ? Has not an Irishman, like an Eng-
</p>
<p>lishman,
</p>
<p>u Senses, affections, passions ? Is he not fed with the same
</p>
<p>food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases,
</p>
<p>healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same
</p>
<p>winter and summer, as" an Englishman ? u If you prick us,
</p>
<p>do we not bleed ? If you tickle us, do we not laugh ? If you
</p>
<p>poison us, do we not die ? And if you wrong us, shall we not'*
</p>
<p>defend ourselves ?
</p>
<p>My requisitions on the reader are few and
</p>
<p>simple. I merely request a candid and patient
</p>
<p>hearing; that no inveterate prejudice may be
</p>
<p>allowed to operate against me ; and that the
</p>
<p>"Vindicise Hibernicse" may not be arraigned at
</p>
<p>the bar of criticism as if it were injudiciously

</p>
<p>any pretensions, but rather as a series of distinct
</p>
<p>and somewhat desultory chapters, tending to
</p>
<p>prove certain points, each insulated from the
</p>
<p>rest. To this view I request the most particular
</p>
<p>attention ; and that it may be constantly borne
</p>
<p>in mind, throughout the perusal of the work.
</p>
<p>I court and defy the most rigorous scrutiny into
</p>
<p>my facts and inductions. Let no mercy be
</p>
<p>shown to those on which there is the least doubt
</p>
<p>or uncertainty : let all be rejected, that do not
</p>
<p>carry with them irresistible conviction. If, in the
</p>
<p>ardent zeal I feel in what I deem the noblest of
</p>
<p>causes, I have occasionally over-rated the force
</p>
<p>of the evidence, and drawn conclusions which that
</p>
<p>evidence does not appear to warrant, on some
</p>
<p>particular points, and if my positions on those be
</p>
<p>rejected, I trust that this decision will not affect
</p>
<p>any of the others. Let each stand forth substan-
</p>
<p>tively by itself, and not bring on the downfal of
</p>
<p>its neighbour by its error, or support its neigh-
</p>
<p>bour's error by its truth.
</p>
<p>Pecuniary considerations have had no place
</p>
<p>among the motives that led to this undertaking.
</p>
<p>This edition consists of only seven hundred and
</p>
<p>fifty copies, of which two hundred and fifty are
</p>
<p>intended to be gratuitously distributed to public
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>P. S. One passage of this work will justify a
</p>
<p>further trespass on the reader's attention.
</p>
<p>In page 31, I have quoted Milton, as stating
</p>
<p>that there were above 600,000 Protestants massa-
</p>
<p>cred in Ireland, during the insurrection of 1641 :
</p>
<p>" The rebellion and horrid massacre of English Protestants
</p>
<p>in Ireland, to the amount of 154,000 in the province of Ulster
</p>
<p>only, by their own computation ; ivhicH, added to the other
</p>
<p>three, makes up the total sum of that slaughter, in all likelihood,
</p>
<p>four times as great"
</p>
<p>This extract is taken from his " Iconoclastes,"
</p>
<p>second edition, page 49. There are, however, in
</p>
<p>the Philadelphia library, two editions of Milton's
</p>
<p>works complete, dated 1738 and 1753, in both of
</p>
<p>which the latter part of the passage, in italics, is
</p>
<p>omitted.
</p>
<p>This discrepancy requires explanation. I have
</p>
<p>taken the citation of Milton from " Harris's His-
</p>
<p>torical Account of the Lives and Writings of
</p>
<p>James I. and Charles I."* in these words :
</p>
<p>" Milton, in the second edition of his Iconoclastes, has the
</p>
<p>following passage : ' The rebellion and horrid massacre,' " &c.
</p>
<p>verbatim, as before.

<p>XXXIV PREFACE.
</p>
<p>We are therefore reduced to this dilemma :
</p>
<p>either Milton stated the falsehood, as above
</p>
<p>quoted, or Harris was guilty of a base fraud and
</p>
<p>literary forgery : but, as he was a man of respect-
</p>
<p>able character, and as, moreover, his work, which
</p>
<p>is of modern date, has passed the ordeal of criti-
</p>
<p>cism in England, the latter supposition cannot be
</p>
<p>admitted. The only conclusion that follows, is,
</p>
<p>that the passage is fairly quoted by Harris ; and
</p>
<p>that Milton, ashamed of the monstrous and extra-
</p>
<p>vagamSlegend, to which he had lent the sanction
</p>
<p>of his name, struck it out, after the second edition
</p>
<p>of nte/work. This recantation extenuates the
</p>
<p>crime, but by no means does away the original

<p>unerringly points' out, to governments and peo-
</p>
<p>ple,, the career of rectitude and of safety. The
</p>
<p>wisdom and folly of our ancestors, placed before
</p>
<p>our eyes, admonish us the course we ought to
</p>
<p>pursue, the conduct we ought to shun ; and the
</p>
<p>most characteristic difference between a sound

<p>and a pettifogging statesman, is, that the warning
</p>
<p>voice of history has its due share of influence
</p>
<p>over the former, while it sounds in vain in the
</p>
<p>ears of the latter.

<p>servient to the sinister purposes of a party or

</p>
<p>most unqualified censure.
</p>
<p>HISTORICAL WRITING. *19
</p>
<p>Under this censure fall the major part of those
</p>
<p>who have written on the affairs of Ireland, whe-
</p>
<p>ther in the imposing form of histories, or politi-
</p>
<p>cal pamphlets, and anniversary sermons. The
</p>
<p>leading object with most of them has been to fan
</p>
<p>and foster the most illiberal and unfounded pre-
</p>
<p>judices, to support and justify the oppression of
</p>
<p>a lordly aristocracy, who, for a century and a
</p>
<p>half, have, with the most unfeeling tyranny, rode
</p>
<p>rough-shod over the great mass of the nation,
</p>
<p>and to hold up that mass as objects of abhorrence.
</p>
<p>There are exceptions : a few writers have dared
</p>
<p>to utter bold truths, however unpalatable to this
</p>
<p>aristocracy. But it is a melancholy fact, that so
</p>
<p>inveterate has Trejudice been on these topics, and
</p>
<p>so difficult to shake off her iron yoke, that some
</p>
<p>of the best-intentioned writers on Irish affairs
</p>
<p>have fallen into many of the most egregious
</p>
<p>errors of their predecessors.
</p>
<p>I shall give one instance, though rather out of
</p>
<p>place here. The fairest and most upright English
</p>
<p>historian of the calamitous period of the civil war
</p>
<p>of 1641, is the Rev. Ferdinando Warner. He has,
</p>
<p>however, fallen into very great errors. In the
</p>
<p>account, for instance, which he gives of the mas-
</p>
<p>sacre (as it is termed) of 1641, he colours as
</p>
<p>highly, and uses almost as extravagant terms, as
</p>
<p>those who asserted that there were one hundred
</p>
<p>and fifty -four thousand murdered in three months;
</p>
<p>or as others, who carried the number to three

<p>hundred thousand ; or as Milton, E who extends it
</p>
<p>20 VINDICIJE HIBERNICJE.
</p>
<p>to above six hundred thousand ! F And yet, won-
</p>
<p>derful to tell, when, towards the close of his work,
</p>
<p>he goes into the examination of the evidence, he
</p>
<p>finds it so ridiculous and inadmissible, that he
</p>
<p>rejects by far the greater part of it, and reduces
</p>
<p>the whole number murdered to about four thou-
</p>
<p>sand. Thus, his facts not only do not warrant
</p>
<p>his inferences, but absolutely destroy them ; for
</p>
<p>it is perfectly obvious, that if there were but four
</p>
<p>thousand murdered, the numberless cruelties he
</p>
<p>so elaborately portrays could not possibly have
</p>
<p>taken place.
</p>

<p>Irish, out of war, extended to these numbers, which, consider-
</p>
<p>ing the nature of several of the depositions, I think in my con"
</p>
<p>science we cannot, yet to be impartial we must allow, that there
</p>
<p>is no pretence for laying a greater number to their charge.
</p>
<p>This account is also corroborated by a letter, which I copied
</p>
<p>out of the Council Books at Dublin, written on the fifth of
</p>
<p>May, sixteen hundred and fifty-two, ten years after the begin-
</p>
<p>ning of the rebellion, from the Parliament Commissioners in
</p>
<p>Ireland to the English Parliament. After exciting them to
</p>
<p>further severity against the Irish, as being afraid " their be-
</p>
<p>haviour towards this people may never sufficiently avenge their
</p>
<p>murders and massacres, and lest the Parliament might shortly
</p>
<p>be in pursuance of a speedy settlement of this nation, and
</p>
<p>thereby some tender concessions might be concluded," the
</p>
<p>Commissioners tell them that it appears " besides eight hun-
</p>
<p>hundred forty-eight families, there "were killed, hanged, burn-
</p>
<p>ed, and drowned, six thousand and sixty-two." 4
</p>
<p>These paragraphs, written by an enlightened
</p>
<p>and independent Protestant historian, after an
</p>
<p>elaborate investigation of the subject, and with
</p>
<p>every conceivable advantage for eliciting truth
</p>
<p>from the mass of falsehood and perjury with
</p>
<p>which it had been previously overwhelmed for a
</p>
<p>century, are amply adequate to sink into con-
</p>
<p>tempt, and to bury in eternal oblivion, the fabu-
</p>
<p>lous accounts of nearly all the other historians,
</p>
<p>who have made the welkin ring with the tremen-
</p>
<p>dous romances of massacres.
</p>
<p>I shall, in the course of this work, collect
</p>
<p>various instances of a similar discrepancy, which
</p>
<p>abound in the histories of Irish affairs.

<p>field, but that is attended with more difficulty,"
</p>
<p>than that of Ireland, during the first half of the
</p>
<p>seventeenth century, to which I principally wish
</p>
<p>to call the attention of the reader.
</p>
<p>But the sinister views or the indolence of
</p>
<p>historians, are by no means the only rocks on
</p>
<p>which history, so far as its noble and legitimate
</p>
<p>purposes are concerned, is in danger of ship-
</p>
<p>wreck. There are others, equally formidable.
</p>
<p>With the most enlightened mind, and the purest
</p>
<p>intentions, the task of the historian is extremely
</p>
<p>arduous ; and he will, for want of proper charts,
</p>
<p>be occasionally, perhaps frequently, driven upon
</p>
<p>the shoals and quicksands of error and falsehood.
</p>
<p>So much of the real character of events, and of
</p>
<p>the actors in them, depends on numberless mi-
</p>
<p>nute circumstances, which elude observation, or
</p>
<p>are liable to most extravagant misconception,
</p>
<p>that it is obvious, historians are often obliged to
</p>
<p>substitute conjecture for fact; and hence pro-
</p>
<p>found observers have styled histories " splendid
</p>
<p>romances;" which designation unfortunately ap-
</p>
<p>plies to a large portion of them.
</p>
<p>In the accounts given of the same occurrences,
</p>
<p>by cotemporaneous writers, of adverse parties or
</p>
<p>hostile nations, there is often such a total discre-
</p>
<p>pancy, that they hardly agree in any thing but
</p>
<p>the dates, and the names of persons and places :
</p>
<p>were these stricken out, it could not be conceiv-
</p>
<p>ed that the narratives had reference to the same

<p>events. And the most disgusting and awful trait
</p>
<p>PRESIDENT AND LITTLE BELT. 23
</p>
<p>in the affair is, that these contradictory and irre-
</p>
<p>concilable accounts are frequently bolstered up,
</p>
<p>on both sides, by the solemnity of appeals to
</p>
<p>heaven, in the form of oaths, taken by persons,
</p>
<p>who, from their standing in society, ought to be
</p>
<p>above the suspicion, not merely of perjury, but
</p>
<p>of the slightest departure from truth.
</p>
<p>As one appropriate example is of more avail
</p>
<p>than a long train of reasoning, I wish to call the
</p>
<p>reader's attention to a striking and recent case,
</p>
<p>which places the difficulty I have stated in the
</p>
<p>strongest point of light, and cannot fail to im-
</p>
<p>press him with a clear idea of its serious impor-
</p>
<p>tance. On the 16th of May, 1811, a rencontre
</p>
<p>took place between two vessels of war, Ame-
</p>
<p>rican and English, the President and Little
</p>
<p>Belt, in which the latter lost a number of men,
</p>
<p>and was in imminent danger of sinking. In
</p>
<p>every material fact, the accounts of the com-
</p>
<p>manders were entirely different ; and to such an
</p>
<p>extravagant degree, that there is no room to
</p>
<p>ascribe the discordance to mistake. There must
</p>
<p>have been clear, deliberate, and disgraceful false-
</p>
<p>hood on one side or the other. There is no
</p>
<p>other alternative.
</p>
<p>Commodore Rodgers stated, that he hailed
</p>
<p>first, that his inquiries, what was the name of
</p>
<p>the vessel, jc. were returned by similar inqui-
</p>
<p>ries, and that, when he repeated his hail, he
</p>
<p>was saluted by a shot, which he of course re-

</p>
<p>turned; that then three others were fired by
</p>
<p>24 V1NDICIJE HIBERNICJE.
</p>
<p>the Little Belt, which were followed by the rest
</p>
<p>of her broadside, and all her musketry ; that
</p>
<p>he then " gave a general order to fire" which,
</p>
<p>in " from four to six minutes," partially silenced
</p>
<p>the guns of his antagonist, and induced the com-
</p>
<p>modore to order a cessation of firing ; that, in
</p>
<p>four minutes, the fire was renewed by the Little
</p>
<p>Belt, and returned by the President with so
</p>
<p>much effect, that the gaff and colours of the
</p>
<p>former were down, his mainsail-yard upon the
</p>
<p>cap, and his fire silenced. 1
</p>
<p>Captain Bingham, on the contrary, stated, that
</p>
<p>he first hailed the President, of which there was
</p>
<p>no notice taken ; that he was hailed afterwards
</p>
<p>by that vessel, which accompanied the inquiry
</p>
<p>with "# broadside" which was "instantly return-
</p>
<p>ed." He adds, " the action then became general,
</p>
<p>and continued for three quarters of an hour,
</p>
<p>when the President ceased firing, and appeared
</p>
<p>to be on fire." " He was," he adds, " obliged to
</p>
<p>desist from firing," that is to say, from the attack
</p>
<p>on the President, as the latter vessel "falling off,"
</p>
<p>his guns " would not bear on her." K The infe-
</p>
<p>rence is not overstrained, that he wished it to be
</p>
<p>understood that the President had escaped from
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>The discrepancy here is extreme. Each
</p>
<p>party charges the other with the original of-
</p>
<p>fence of the aggression. This is all-important.
</p>
<p>And the American commander states, that, in the

<p>first instance, he silenced the Little Belt in from
</p>
<p>PRESIDENT AND LITTLE BELT. 25
</p>
<p>four to six minutes, and, in the second, in from
</p>
<p>three to five: whereas, according to captain Bing-
</p>
<p>ham, the action continued " three quarters of an
</p>
<p>hour" and was discontinued by commodore
</p>
<p>Rodgers, whose vessel was on fire; and he
</p>
<p>was disabled from pursuing the President, in
</p>
<p>consequence of the state of his sails and rig-
</p>
<p>ging. To cap the climax, the depositions of a
</p>
<p>number of the officers and men on both sides
</p>
<p>were taken, and appeared to confirm these con-
</p>
<p>tradictory accounts ; so that to gross and revolt-
</p>
<p>ing falsehood, is added barefaced perjury, on one
</p>
<p>side or the other. It is wholly irrelevant to my
</p>
<p>purpose to inquire where the falsification rested.
</p>
<p>Subsequent events, however, have shed adequate
</p>
<p>light upon the subject.
</p>
<p>To this strong and pointed case, I invite the
</p>
<p>most serious attention of the reader. To the
</p>
<p>falsehood and perjury involved in it, there were
</p>
<p>no very extraordinary temptations, particularly
</p>
<p>to the perjury. It might have been of great im-
</p>
<p>portance, indeed, to the aggressor, to exonerate
</p>
<p>himself from the criminality of the aggression,
</p>
<p>in order to escape the danger of being cashiered :
</p>
<p>but the officers and men had no such temptation ;
</p>
<p>nor is it easy to perceive what temptation they
</p>
<p>could have had to the commission of such a
</p>
<p>heinous offence.
</p>
<p>I had intended to adduce other cases in point: 1 -
</p>
<p>but I forbear. I feel convinced, that no analo-
</p>
<p>gous facts, how strong soever, could enhance the

</p>
<p>cogency of the inferences deducible from this
</p>
<p>incident. There is one point of view in which
</p>
<p>it may be regarded, that ought not to be over-
</p>
<p>looked. In the present state of printing, and the
</p>
<p>open, unreserved communication between na-
</p>
<p>tions, fraud and falsehood can hardly flatter
</p>
<p>themselves to escape detection. This considera-
</p>
<p>tion must have powerful operation to circum-
</p>
<p>scribe and restrain them, and was almost wholly
</p>
<p>unknown in former times, when of course the
</p>
<p>inducements to fraud and perjury were so far
</p>
<p>greater than they are at present.
</p>
<p>The application remains, and can hardly fail
</p>
<p>to have been anticipated by the reader. Not-
</p>
<p>withstanding the slenderness of the temptation to
</p>
<p>perjury, and the absolute certainty of detection,
</p>
<p>it was, we see, flagrantly committed in this case.
</p>
<p>What a lesson on history generally but more

<p>especially on Irish history ! What dependence,
</p>
<p>under this view of the materials from which his-
</p>
<p>tory is formed, can be placed on the accounts of

<p>the affairs of that nation, which are wholly ex

<p>parte where the temptations were so enormous,

<p>extravagant to state, that at various periods,
</p>
<p>wholly exclusive of the rebellion of 1641, mil-
</p>
<p>lions of acres of the soil of Ireland have been
</p>
<p>forfeited for pretended plots and conspiracies,
</p>
<p>which were a never-failing source of rapine upon,
</p>
<p>and oppression of, the natives. In a future chap-
</p>
<p>ter, I shall state some of them in detail. Nothing
</p>
<p>could exceed the wickedness of the contrivers,
</p>
<p>except the clumsiness of the contrivances. Ano-
</p>
<p>nymous letters, dropped in the castle of Dublin,
</p>
<p>accusing of treason noblemen and gentlemen of
</p>
<p>large estates, were one of the principal levers

<p>affair is, that Leland, thus convinced of the ex-

<p>istence of these "manifest forgeries" should

<p>himself, through a large portion of his history,

<p>century and a half, the talents of numbers of

<p>F P. 20. Few, even of the learned, know this
</p>
<p>fact respecting Milton, which displays such an aw-
</p>
<p>ful disregard of truth, as attaches an eternal blot
</p>
<p>on his memory. The reader may readily conceive
</p>
<p>what poignant distress was excited by the disco-
</p>
<p>very of a procedure so diametrically opposite to
</p>
<p>the general character of Milton, whom we are
</p>
<p>taught, from infancy, to regard as ranking
</p>
<p>among the best of men. But, after all, it only
</p>
<p>adds one to the numberless proofs already before
</p>
<p>the world, of the fallibility of human nature, and
</p>
<p>evinces that he was but a mere man, and, so
</p>
<p>far as respects this case, either grossly deceived,
</p>
<p>or a gross deceiver ; there is no other alterna-
</p>
<p>tive : and a liberal examination will more readily
</p>
<p>incline us to place in the latter than in the former
</p>
<p>class, the man who could, in cold blood, to pan-
</p>
<p>der to the purposes of a party, intimate an opi-
</p>
<p>nion, that there were above six hundred thousand
</p>
<p>Protestants massacred in Ireland, at a period

<p>when the whole population was not many more

<p>than a million, and when the Protestants were

<p>G P. 20. It is easier to conjecture.] This sen-
</p>
<p>tence exhibits a manifest dereliction of the duty
</p>
<p>of an historian. Warner had before him the
</p>
<p>plain fact, that the mass of testimony was doubled
</p>
<p>or trebled by the admission of hearsay evidence,
</p>
<p>"what this body heard another body say:" 6 and
</p>
<p>there was no difficulty in ascertaining the object,
</p>
<p>which the historian ought to have stated. This
</p>
<p>object was to criminate the Catholics, sacrifice
</p>
<p>them on gibbets, and confiscate their property.
</p>
<p>That this was Dr. Warner's "conjecture" cannot
</p>
<p>be doubted. The phraseology admits of no other
</p>
<p>construction. But it is merely insinuated, in a
</p>
<p>manner unworthy of so very respectable an his-
</p>
<p>torian.
</p>
<p>H P. 22. Mended with more difficulty.'] This
</p>
<p>difficulty requires explanation. The power and
</p>
<p>influence of the oligarchy in Ireland, which tri-
</p>
<p>umphantly styles itself, "the Protestant ascen-
</p>
<p>dency" have been erected on the basis of the
</p>
<p>frauds of this portion of the history of Ireland,
</p>
<p>whereby they have been enabled to enslave, op-
</p>
<p>press, and destroy their fellow subjects at their
</p>
<p>pleasure : and " Great is the Diana of Ephesus,"
</p>
<p>whenever the " craft was in danger" by any se-
</p>
<p>rious effort to dispel the mists of prejudice, they
</p>
<p>have spared neither pains nor expense to coun-
</p>
<p>teract the Godlike purpose. Their most sacred

<p>t P. 25. Other cases in point.'] Two cis- Atlantic
</p>
<p>cases, of recent discussion, afford abundant matter
</p>
<p>for reflection. They are, the battle of Bunker's
</p>
<p>Hill, and the capture of major Andre. The opi-
</p>
<p>nions that have heretofore universally prevailed,
</p>
<p>respecting the conduct of general Putnam in the
</p>
<p>former, and on the character and motives of the
</p>
<p>captors of the unfortunate major, have been of
</p>
<p>late brought into controversy, and debated with
</p>
<p>great zeal and ardour. On the latter question,
</p>
<p>the opinion, so honourable to the parties, as well
</p>
<p>as to then 1 country, whereby the procedure is
</p>
<p>rendered so invaluable and beneficial to the world
</p>
<p>in point of example, has been unanimously con-
</p>

<p>i P. 24. Extract from the despatches of Commodore Rodgers to
</p>
<p>the Secretary of the Navy, dated May 23, 1811.
</p>
<p>" At fifteen or twenty minutes past eight, being a little for-
</p>
<p>ward of her weather beam, and distant from seventy to a hun-
</p>
<p>dred yards, hailed, " What ship is that ?" To this inquiry
</p>
<p>no answer was given : but I was hailed by her commander,
</p>
<p>and asked, " What ship is that ?" Having asked the first
</p>
<p>question, I of course considered myself entitled, by the com-
</p>
<p>mon rules of politeness, to the first answer. After a pause of
</p>
<p>fifteen or twenty seconds, I reiterated my first inquiry of,
</p>
<p>" What ship is that ?" and before I had time to take the trum-
</p>
<p>pet from my mouth, was answered by a shot, that cut off one
</p>
<p>of our main-top back-stays, and went into our main-mast. At
</p>
<p>this instant, captain Caldwell (of marines) who was standing
</p>
<p>very near me, on the gangway, having observed, " Sir, she
</p>
<p>has fired at us," caused me to pause. Just as I was in the
</p>
<p>act of giving an order to fire a shot in return, and before I had
</p>
<p>time to resume the repetition of the intended order, a shot
</p>
<p>was actually fired from the second division of this ship, and
</p>
<p>was scarcely out of the gun, before it was answered from our
</p>
<p>assumed enemy, by three others, in quick succession, and soon
</p>
<p>after by the rest of his broadside and musketry. When the first
</p>
<p>shot was fired, being under an impression that it might possi-
</p>
<p>bly have proceeded from accident, and without the orders of
</p>
<p>the commander, I had determined, at the moment, to fire only
</p>
<p>a single shot in return ; but the immediate repetition of the
</p>
<p>previous unprovoked outrage induced me to believe that the
</p>
<p>insult was premeditated ; and that, from our adversary being
</p>
<p>at that time as ignorant of our real force as I was of his, he
</p>
<p>thought this, perhaps, a favourable opportunity of acquiring
</p>
<p>promotion, although at the expense of violating our neutrality,
</p>
<p>and insulting our flag. I accordingly, with that degree of re-
</p>
<p>pugnance incident to feeling, equally determined neither to be
</p>
<p>the aggressor, nor suffer the flag of my country to be insulted

<p>with impunity, gave a general order to fire; the effect of which,
</p>
<p>in from four to six minutes, as near as I can judge, having
</p>
<p>produced a partial silence of his guns, I gave orders to cease
</p>
<p>firing, discovering, by the feeble opposition, that it must be a
</p>
<p>ship of very inferior force to what I had supposed ; or that
</p>
<p>some untoward accident had happened to her.

</p>
<p>" My orders, in this instance, however, (although they pro-
</p>
<p>eeeded alone from motives of humanity, and a determination
</p>
<p>not to spill a drop of blood unnecessarily,) I had, in less than
</p>
<p>four minutes, some reason to regret ; as he renewed his fire,
</p>
<p>of which two thirty-two pound shot cut off one of our fore
</p>
<p>shrouds, and injured our foremast. It was now that I found
</p>
<p>myself under the painful necessity of giving orders for a re-
</p>
<p>petition of our fire, against a force which our forbearance alone
</p>
<p>had enabled to do us any injury of moment. Our fire was
</p>
<p>accordingly renewed, and continued from three to Jive minutes
</p>
<p>longer, when, perceiving our opponent's gaff and colours down,
</p>
<p>his maintopsail-yard upon the cap, and his fire silenced, al-
</p>
<p>though it was so dark, that I could not discern any other par-
</p>
<p>ticular injury we had done, or how far he was in a situation
</p>
<p>to do us further harm, I nevertheless embraced the earliest
</p>
<p>moment to stop our fire, and prevent the further effusion of
</p>
<p>blood."

<p>" The ship was brought to, her colours hoisted, her guns
</p>
<p>double-shotted, and every preparation made in case of a sur-
</p>
<p>prise. By his manner of steering down, he evidently wished
</p>
<p>to lay his ship in a position for raking, which I frustrated, by
</p>
<p>wearing three times. About fifteen minutes past eight, he
</p>
<p>came within hail. I hailed, and asked, What ship that was ?
</p>
<p>he again repeated my words, and fired a broadside, which I
</p>
<p>instantly returned. The action then became general, and
</p>
<p>continued so for three quarters of an hour, when he ceased
</p>
<p>firing, and seemed to be on fire about the main-hatchway.
</p>
<p>He then filled. / was obliged to desist from firing, as the
</p>
<p>ship falling off, no gun would bear, and had no after sail to
</p>
<p>keep her to, all the rigging and sails cut to pieces ; not a
</p>
<p>brace nor a bow-line left. He hailed, and asked what ship
</p>
<p>this was : I told him. He then asked me if I had struck my

<p>colours ? my answer, No : and asked what ship it was ? as
</p>
<p>plain as I could understand, (he having shot some distance at
</p>
<p>this time) he answered, The United States' frigate. He fired
</p>
<p>no more guns, but stood from us, giving no reason for his
</p>
<p>most extraordinary conduct."

<p>IRISH HISTORY. 35
</p>
<p>If this view be correct, as I think can hardly
</p>
<p>be disputed, even so far as respects history writ-
</p>
<p>ten with a sincere regard to truth, and a fixed
</p>
<p>and unalterable determination not to swerve, in-
</p>
<p>tentionally, from her luminous path, how de-
</p>
<p>plorable must be the case with histories, of which
</p>
<p>the original authors were under the influence of
</p>
<p>all the hideous passions that deform and degrade
</p>
<p>human nature, and assimilate men to demons
</p>
<p>bigotry, A dire insatiable rancour, national hosti-
</p>
<p>lity, a ravenous thirst for the blood 8 and estates
</p>
<p>of the natives, and where the modern authors
</p>
<p>are servile copyists, who implicitly follow in the
</p>
<p>beaten and foul path of their predecessors !
</p>
<p>Almost all the writers of Irish history, down
</p>
<p>to Sir John Temple, were precisely in this situa-
</p>
<p>tion, under the influence often of the whole, but
</p>
<p>never free from the goadings of some, of those
</p>
<p>dire passions. They were the historians of their
</p>
<p>own exploits, and pursued the horrible system of
</p>
<p>policy which led Rome to the establishment of
</p>
<p>her grinding tyranny over the greater part of the
</p>
<p>then known world, and which has laid the popu-
</p>
<p>lous and once mighty empire of Hindostan pros-
</p>
<p>trate at the feet of a small body of merchants in
</p>
<p>Leadenhall street. The unfortunate natives of
</p>
<p>Ireland, as well the descendants of the Strong-

<p>ly goaded into insurrection : every spark of dis-
</p>
<p>cord between rival chieftains was fanned into a
</p>
<p>flame, to afford the government a pretext for
</p>
<p>interfering between them, crushing both, sacri-
</p>
<p>ficing their lives, and enriching the governors
</p>
<p>with their lordly possessions ; and when, thus
</p>
<p>goaded, they recurred to arms, in defence of
</p>
<p>themselves, then- wives, their children, and their
</p>
<p>estates, they were pursued with the most ruthless
</p>
<p>and remorseless cruelty ; E and, to palliate the ty-
</p>
<p>ranny, the rapine, and the barbarities of their
</p>
<p>oppressors, they were overwhelmed with the
</p>
<p>foulest abuse, and portraits drawn of them, which
</p>
<p>would have better suited incarnate demons than
</p>
<p>human beings. F
</p>
<p>I have already hinted, that one of the principal
</p>
<p>objects of this work is to investigate the insur-
</p>
<p>rection of 1641, strip it of the fraudulent mis-
</p>
<p>representations by which it has been disfigured,
</p>
<p>and lay it before the world in the garb of truth.
</p>
<p>In order, therefore, to induce the reader to
</p>
<p>bring to the subject a large portion of candour,
</p>
<p>to evince on how " sandy a foundation" this story
</p>
<p>rests, to expose the blind credulity, or the si-
</p>
<p>nister policy, of the great body of historians, who
</p>
<p>have given full faith and confidence to the narra-
</p>
<p>tive of Sir John Temple, I shall submit a fair
</p>
<p>specimen of the documents on which his history
</p>
<p>depends for support. Fortunately for the holy

<p>and his history, he has quoted his authorities at

<p>TEMPLE, CLARENDON, $C. 37
</p>
<p>full length. They are taken from the " thirty-two
</p>
<p>thick folio volumes of depositions" mentioned by
</p>
<p>Warner, 8 which exhibit such a mass of fraud,
</p>
<p>falsehood, absurdity, and let me add impossibility,
</p>
<p>as I may venture to assert never was exhibited
</p>
<p>before, and, for the honour of human nature, it
</p>
<p>is to be hoped, never will be again. These de-
</p>
<p>positions demand a much more detailed exposi-
</p>
<p>tion than I can give them in the present chapter.
</p>
<p>It is a melancholy truth, that they form the basis
</p>
<p>of all the horrible narratives on this subject, of
</p>
<p>all the authors who have treated on it, from
</p>
<p>Temple to Clarendon, from Clarendon to Bor-
</p>
<p>lase, from Borlase to Hume, and from Hume
</p>
<p>down to Russell's Modern Europe. Temple
</p>
<p>embellished them with all the hideous colouring
</p>
<p>that could excite terror and abhorrence : and, I
</p>
<p>repeat, nearly all the succeeding historians have
</p>
<p>laid Temple under heavy contributions, and, with-
</p>
<p>out adverting to the fabulous evidence on which
</p>
<p>he relies, and which carries its own condemna-
</p>
<p>tion with it, have borrowed not merely his facts,
</p>
<p>but his very phraseology. The overwhelming
</p>
<p>decision of Dr. Warner, which I have quoted in
</p>
<p>page 20, ought to have set the question at rest,
</p>
<p>above fifty years ago.

<p>I shall therefore devote several chapters to

<p>this particular subject, and give such copious ex-

<p>man whose heart is not steeled, and whose con-
</p>
<p>science is not seared, against doing justice to the
</p>
<p>Irish, of the superlative wickedness of the tribu-
</p>
<p>nals which received such depositions, the equally
</p>
<p>superlative folly of the writer who filled his book

</p>
<p>ness (to use the most favourable terms) of those
</p>
<p>writers who relied on such a deceptious, fraudu-
</p>
<p>lent guide.
</p>
<p>To relieve the sombre hue of this long chap-
</p>
<p>ter, I shall give anticipatory extracts from a few
</p>
<p>of those wonderful tales, from which, as I have
</p>
<p>said, Temple and his copyists have drawn their
</p>
<p>highly-coloured pictures of the massacre.
</p>
<p>" Arthur Culm, of Cloughwater, in the county of Cavan,
</p>
<p>esquire, deposeth, That he -was credibly informed, by some
</p>
<p>that were present there, that there were thirty women and
</p>
<p>young children, and seven men, flung into the river of Beltur-
</p>
<p>bert; and when some of them offered to swim for their lives,
</p>
<p>they were, by the rebels, followed in boats, and knocked on
</p>
<p>the head with poles ; the same day they hanged two women
</p>
<p>at Turbert ; and this deponent doth -verily believe, that Mul-
</p>
<p>more O'Rely, the then sheriff, had a hand in the commanding
</p>
<p>the murder of those said persons, for that he saw him write
</p>
<p>two notes, which he sent to Turbert, by Brien O'Rely, upon
</p>
<p>whose coming these murders were committed : and those per-

<p>sons who were present, also affirmed, that the bodies of those
</p>
<p>thirty persons drowned did not appear upon the water till

<p>about six weeks after, past ; as the said CPRely came to the

</p>
<p>MIRACULOUS APPEARANCE. 39
</p>
<p>It may not be time misemployed to examine
</p>
<p>this deposition, which, I beg leave to say, is less
</p>
<p>exceptionable than many others of this precious
</p>
<p>collection. The deponent was, in the first place,
</p>
<p>" credibly informed" that these persons " were
</p>
<p>flung into the river" and this information he had
</p>
<p>from " some* who were present there." He " ve-
</p>
<p>rily believed that Mulmore O'Rely had a hand in
</p>
<p>commanding the murder:" and his "belief" rest-
</p>
<p>ed on the very cogent and convincing reason,
</p>
<p>that he " saw him write two notes, which he sent
</p>
<p>to Turbert by Brien O'Rely, on whose coming
</p>
<p>these murders were committed." On this strong
</p>
<p>evidence, Mulmore O'Rely, in all likelihood, lost
</p>
<p>his life and estate, which estate was probably
</p>
<p>guilty of the murder. In Ireland, in former
</p>
<p>times, under the mild government of England,
</p>
<p>large estates were frequently guilty of enormous
</p>
<p>crimes, particularly high treason, and deservedly
</p>
<p>punished : and the larger they were, the more
</p>
<p>prone to guilt, and the more certain of punish-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>But on casting my eye once more over the
</p>
<p>deposition, I find I overlooked the chief part of
</p>
<p>the evidence against Mulmore. The "thirty
</p>
<p>bodies" (seven remained behind) rose up by com-
</p>
<p>mon consent, when this murderer made his ap-
</p>
<p>pearance, and " came floating up to the very
</p>
<p>bridge" probably as public prosecutors of this
</p>
<p>horrid culprit. It is not said, unfortunately, whe-

<p>ther they took their oaths to the murder : this is.

</p>
<p>however, presumable ; and it is to be supposed
</p>
<p>that it was owing to an oversight, that Temple
</p>
<p>was silent on the subject. A doubt has been
</p>
<p>started by a learned barrister, whether the ap-
</p>
<p>pearance of these bodies, " floating up to the very
</p>
<p>bridge," at the critical minute, when the said
</p>
<p>O'Rely " came to town," is to be considered as
</p>
<p>positive or circumstantial evidence. Much of this
</p>
<p>would depend on the property of Mulmore. If
</p>
<p>he were a very rich man, the appearance of
</p>
<p>" thirty bodies floating to the very bridge" ought
</p>
<p>to be regarded as positive evidence ; but if a poor
</p>
<p>man, not worth hanging, it ought to be set down
</p>
<p>as circumstantial.
</p>
<p>But to be serious :
</p>
<p>Lives there a man who can peruse this depo-
</p>
<p>sition, find it introduced into a grave history,
</p>
<p>know it to have been a part of the evidence on
</p>
<p>which rests the credit of the tales of what Bor-
</p>
<p>lase's title-page states as " the execrable Irish Re-
</p>
<p>bellion" and to have been, with other evidence,
</p>
<p>equally absurd, instrumental in confiscating the
</p>
<p>property and immolating the lives of the Irish
</p>
<p>Catholics; without a strong sentiment of mingled
</p>
<p>astonishment and indignation, without a thorough
</p>
<p>conviction, that all the histories, grounded on such
</p>
<p>documents, however supported by the imposing
</p>
<p>names of Clarendon, Hume, or Russell, must
</p>
<p>be radically false and corrupt, and worthy to be

<p>wounded, his belly ripped up, and his entrails taken out, and

<p>lifted him up, and carried him away ; at which this deponent

<p>they used him, after they had drawn him to go to mass with

<p>Almost every circumstance narrated in Tem-
</p>
<p>ple's history, is corroborated by one or more de-
</p>
<p>positions. Most of them are fully as absurd and as
</p>
<p>perjured as the above. A very large proportion
</p>
<p>are hearsay : " A being credibly informed that B
</p>
<p>had murdered one hundred Protestants," #>c. $c.
</p>
<p>In the devouring rage against the persons, and
</p>
<p>lust after the property, of the Catholics, every kind

</p>
<p>improbable, or impossible.
</p>
<p>In the number of the witnesses, who testify to
</p>
<p>the pretended massacre, the most distinguished is
</p>
<p>a dean Maxwell, afterwards bishop of Kilmore,
</p>
<p>an abstract of whose deposition is to be found in

<p>the Appendix to Borlase's history. It is a sort of

<p>history of the insurrection, and occupies no less

<p>than twelve large folio pages, which contain so

<p>many extravagant and impossible tales, that no

<p>pages the whole contained, whether twenty, or
</p>
<p>fifty, or one hundred, it is impossible for me to
</p>
<p>decide ; it is " to be sought for in the archives of

<p>Dublin." 17 On the dean's authority rests the
</p>
<p>hacknied and Gulliverian assertion, that the pre-
</p>
<p>cise number of one hundred and fifty-four thou-
</p>
<p>sand were massacred, in three months, in Ulster :
</p>
<p>and yet, wonderful to tell, there is in this very

<p>deposition, on the all-important topic of the "hun-

<p>a most palpable and overwhelming contradiction,
</p>
<p>which at once destroys its credibility. In one
</p>
<p>part of it, the dean swears that " it was credibly
</p>
<p>told him, that the persons slaughtered amounted
</p>
<p>to one hundred and fifty-four thousand, whether
</p>
<p>in Ulster or the whole kingdom, he durst not in-
</p>
<p>quire."* Why he durst not inquire, is not stated;
</p>
<p>and it is impossible to assign any reason : the
</p>
<p>story carries absurdity on its face: the one
</p>
<p>kind of information was as readily and as soon
</p>
<p>acquired as the other. In a subsequent page, he
</p>
<p>swears positively, that " there were then above one
</p>
<p>hundred and fifty-four thousand wanting in the
</p>
<p>province of Ulster alone." This discordance,
</p>
<p>which would destroy the evidence, in any ho-
</p>
<p>nourable court in Christendom, of a Washington,
</p>
<p>a Franklin, a Fayette, a Sheridan, a Brougham,
</p>
<p>or a Wyndham, was of no importance in the era

<p>of perjury, anno 1642, when the lives and for-

<p>princely fortunes were the reward of the perju-

<p>rer and his employer.

</p>

<p>bring in a true account of them; and that the persons so

<p>" He might add to these many thousands more : but the
</p>
<p>diary which he, the deponent, wrote among the rebels, being
</p>
<p>burned with his house, books, and all his- papers, he referreth
</p>
<p>himself to the number in gross, which the rebels themselves
</p>
<p>have upon inquiry found out and acknowledged, which not-
</p>
<p>withstanding will come short of all that have been murdered in
</p>
<p>Ireland, there being above one hundred jifty and four thousand
</p>
<p>now wanting of the British within the very precinct of Ul-
</p>
<p>ster. And the deponent further saith, that it was common
</p>
<p>table-talk amongst the rebels, that the ghosts of Mr. William
</p>
<p>Fullerton, Timothy Jephes, and the most of those who were
</p>
<p>thrown over Portnedown bridge, were daily and nightly seen
</p>
<p>to walk upon the river, sometimes singing of psalms, some-
</p>
<p>times brandishing of naked swords, and sometimes screeching
</p>
<p>in the most hideous and fearful manner. The deponent did
</p>
<p>not believe the same at first, and yet is doubtful whether to
</p>
<p>believe it or not; but saith that divers of the rebels assured
</p>
<p>him, that they themselves did dwell near to the said river,
</p>
<p>and being daily frighted with these apparitions (but especial-
</p>
<p>ly with their horrible screeching) were in conclusion forced
</p>
<p>to remove further into the country. Their own priests and
</p>
<p>friars could not deny the truth thereof; but as oft as it was by
</p>
<p>deponent objected unto them, they said, that it was but a
</p>
<p>cunning slight of the devil to hinder this great work of propa-
</p>
<p>gating the catholic religion, and killing of heretics ; or that it
</p>
<p>was wrought by witchcraft. The deponent himself lived
</p>
<p>within thirteen miles of the bridge, and never heard any man
</p>
<p>so much as doubt of the truth thereof; howsoever the de-
</p>
<p>ponent obligeth no man's faith, in regard he saw it not with

<p>his own eyes ; otherwise he had as much certainty as morally

<p>could be required of such a matter" 19

<p>Could there be a more extravagant idea held

<p>A P. 35. Bigotry.'] Thank Heaven, we live

<p>in an enlightened age, whose liberality on the

<p>subject of differences in religious opinions, ren-
</p>
<p>ders it difficult to conceive the deplorable bigotry
</p>
<p>and rancorous spirit of intolerance, that prevailed
</p>
<p>in that dark and persecuting era. Each denomi-
</p>
<p>nation of Christians regarded its own opinions
</p>
<p>as infallible, and all others as heretical and dam-
</p>
<p>nable : and, next to the right of worshipping
</p>
<p>God as they thought proper, they prized the
</p>
<p>right to control, restrain, and persecute all who
</p>
<p>dared to differ from them ; and instances are to
</p>
<p>be found, of then 1 exculpating themselves from
</p>
<p>the charge of being friendly to toleration, as from
</p>
<p>some foul crime. All abhorred it, as the

<p>greatest abomination. The solemn league and

<p>tion, heresy, schism, and whatsoever shall be found
</p>
<p>to be contrary to sound doctrine and the power of

<p>Godliness." Popery had originally an exclusive
</p>
<p>monopoly of the detestation of the Puritans ; but
</p>
<p>when they had succeeded in suppressing it, the
</p>
<p>established religion, from its supposed affinity to
</p>

<p>itself into the production of a system of the most
</p>
<p>revolting injustice. A slight sketch of it would
</p>
<p>fill volumes. It would extend beyond the limits
</p>
<p>prescribed to this chapter, to enter into detail.
</p>
<p>I shall therefore confine myself, for the present,
</p>
<p>to two of its features, by which some idea may be
</p>
<p>formed of its true character. These were framed
</p>
<p>under Protestant Episcopal monarchs.
</p>
<p>A Roman Catholic was liable to a penalty of
</p>
<p>twenty pounds a month, (and observe, there were
</p>
<p>thirteen months in the legal year) if he did not
</p>
<p>attend public worship, in one of the established
</p>
<p>churches, on Sundays. This extravagant and
</p>
<p>ruinous penalty, which was imposed under Eliza-
</p>
<p>beth, was not deemed enough to satisfy the rapa-
</p>
<p>city of the ruling party under James I. ; and ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly an act was passed, in the third year of
</p>
<p>his reign, authorizing the king to seize two-thirds
</p>
<p>of the estates of the Roman Catholics, in lieu of
</p>
<p>the penalty. 33

</p>
<p>But wicked as was this law, there was one
</p>
<p>that far exceeded it. A penalty of ten pounds a
</p>
<p>month was imposed on those who " relieved or
</p>
<p>harboured" persons who did not attend worship
</p>
<p>in some established church : and to this penalty
</p>
<p>every man or woman was liable, even for " main-
</p>
<p>taining, retaining, relieving, keeping, or harbour-
</p>
<p>ing his or her father or mother," if that father or
</p>
<p>mother were within the purview of the statute.
</p>
<p>But, as " a special grace and favour," there was
</p>
<p>a clause, exempting from the penalty those whose
</p>
<p>parents were paupers, or destitute of " sufficient
</p>
<p>maintenance."
</p>
<p>" Provided nevertheless, That this act shall not in any wise
</p>
<p>extend to punish, or impeach, any person or persons, FOR
</p>
<p>MAINTAINING, RETAINING, RELIEVING, KEEPING, OR HAR-
</p>
<p>BOURING HIS, HER, OR THEIR FATHER OR MOTHER! Wanting,
</p>
<p>without fraud or covin, other habitation, or sufficient mainte-
</p>

</p>
<p>shall be committed by authority to the custody of any by whom
</p>
<p>they shall be so relieved, maintained, or kept ; any thing in
</p>
<p>this act contained to the contrary notwithstanding." 34
</p>
<p>This provision, however, ought not to be sup-
</p>
<p>posed to arise from liberality or justice, but from
</p>
<p>a sordid fear, lest the poor parents should become
</p>
<p>burdensome to the parish.

<p>natives."] However shocking and incredible it
</p>
<p>may appear, it is established, by the concurring
</p>
<p>testimony of Clarendon, Carte, Warner, Le-
</p>
<p>land, and nearly all the other writers on that
</p>
<p>period of Irish history, that the predominant
</p>
<p>party in Ireland cherished, for a considerable
</p>
<p>time, the bloodthirsty and barbarous project of
</p>
<p>an utter extirpation of the Catholics, and the es-
</p>
<p>tablishment of new plantations all over the king-
</p>
<p>dom. To the attainment of this nefarious object,
</p>
<p>all their measures were invariably directed : nor
</p>
<p>did they abandon it from its inhumanity, but from
</p>
<p>finding it utterly impracticable.
</p>
<p>" The favourite object of the Irish governors, and the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish parliament, was the utter extermination of all the Catholic
</p>
<p>inhabitants of Ireland ! Their estates were already marked out,
</p>
<p>and allotted to their conquerors ; so that they and their poste-
</p>
<p>rity were consigned to inevitable ruin." 4 *
</p>
<p>" It is evident from their [the lords justices] last letter to the
</p>
<p>lieutenant, that they hoped for an extirpation, not of the mere
</p>
<p>Irish only, but of all the old English families that were Roman
</p>
<p>Catholics." 53 '
</p>
<p>" Whatever were the professions of the chief governors,
</p>
<p>the only danger they really apprehended, was that of a too
</p>
<p>speedy suppression of the rebels. The futility of their pre-
</p>
<p>tences and affected fears was instantly discovered." 43
</p>
<p>" The justices seem to have taken proper measures to exas-
</p>
<p>perate the natives against the English transplanted thither, as
</p>
<p>if they were so secure of baffling the rebels when they pleased,
</p>
<p>that they wished that they might go on unchecked for a while,

</p>
<p>many things, which did not only exasperate, but render the
</p>
<p>Irish desperate, as will appear by several of their own letters,
</p>
<p>and public acts of state ; and that, in the first eruption of the
</p>
<p>rebellion, they had a greater eye to the forfeitures of the rebels' 1
</p>
<p>estates, than to use such means as might, by the hopes of par-
</p>
<p>don, induce the better sort of the nobility, gentry, and free-
</p>
<p>holders to hear reason, and to come in and submit themselves
</p>
<p>to his majesty's mercy, though they had express directions
</p>
<p>from the king and the two houses so to do : and it is no less
</p>
<p>notorious, that Sir John Temple, in writing his history, was
</p>
<p>bound by confederacy to assert the proceedings of the then
</p>

<p>" The parliament party, who had heaped so many re-
</p>
<p>proaches and calumnies upon the king, for his clemency to the
</p>
<p>Irish, who had grounded their own authority and strength up-
</p>
<p>on such foundations as were inconsistent with any toleration
</p>
<p>of the Roman Catholic religion, and even -with any humanity
</p>
<p>to the Irish nation, and more especially to those of the old na-
</p>
<p>tive extraction, the -whole race -whereof they had upon the mat-
</p>
<p>ter sworn to extirpate"* 6
</p>
<p>" To say nothing of what was done by that Parliament, re-
</p>
<p>lating to affairs here which had an affinity to those of Ireland,
</p>
<p>the House of Commons passed a vote, that no toleration of the
</p>
<p>Romish religion should be allowed in Ireland; and that the
</p>
<p>House of Lords should be desired to join with them, in ad-
</p>
<p>dressing the king to make a public declaration to that effect.
</p>
<p>This might serve their own ends perhaps, but was surely very
</p>
<p>unseasonable with regard to Ireland, where nothing could so
</p>
<p>much promote the cause of the rebellion, as to have it thought

</p>
<p>were received as oracles, their commands obeyed as laws, and
</p>
<p>extirpation preached for Gospel"* 9
</p>
<p>" Though extirpation both of nation and religion be not
</p>
<p>named, yet I conceive it is contrived almost in every proposi-
</p>
<p>tion; and the consideration thereof confirms me in a full belief
</p>
<p>of the malicious practices of the Cootes and Ormsbyes, in the
</p>
<p>county of Roscommon." 60
</p>
<p>ttf The term of extirpation is worn out here, and the intention
</p>
<p>not acknowledged to me by the prime authors therein, with
</p>
<p>whom I have been plain after my blunt way." 61
</p>
<p>" The reason of their [the justices] advice is founded upon
</p>
<p>their darling scheme of an extirpation of the old English pro-
</p>
<p>prietors, and a general plantation of the whole kingdom with a
</p>
<p>new colony ; for this is the meaning of what they allege, to
</p>
<p>show it to be " unsafe for his majesty, and destructive to the
</p>
<p>kingdom, to grant the petitioners' request ; as being altogether
</p>
<p>inconsistent with the means of raising a considerable revenue

<p>for his crown, of settling religion and civility in the kingdom ;
</p>
<p>and of establishing a firm and lasting peace, to the honour of
</p>
<p>his majesty, the safety of his royal posterity, and the comfort
</p>
<p>of all his faithful subjects." 62
</p>
<p>" By precipitate votes, the two Houses, confiscating all their
</p>
<p>lands, and making sale of them, cast the whole nation into such
</p>
<p>a general despair, that if there were any loyal or innocent

<p>These difficulties and considerations were of little weight
</p>
<p>with the lords justices ; who, having got a thin House of
</p>
<p>Commons to their mind, of persons devoted to their interest
</p>
<p>and measures, resolved to improve the opportunity offered,
</p>
<p>and to get such acts passed, as might distress the king, exas-
</p>
<p>perate the bulk of the nation, spread the rebellion, and so pro-
</p>
<p>mote their darling scheme of extinguishing the old proprietors,
</p>
<p>and making a new plantation of the kingdom"**
</p>
<p>" Such considerations as these were not agreeable to the
</p>
<p>views of the lords justices, who had set their hearts on the ex-
</p>
<p>tirpation, not merely of the mere Irish, but likewise of all the
</p>
<p>old English families that were Roman Catholics, and the mak-
</p>
<p>ing of a new plantation all over the kingdom ; in which they
</p>
<p>could not fail to have a principal share ; so all their reasonings,
</p>
<p>upon all occasions, were calculated and intended to promote
</p>
<p>that their favourite scheme.
</p>
<p>" This scheme would have been destroyed, if the rebels in
</p>
<p>general had submitted, upon the late proclamation ; there was
</p>
<p>a general disposition in those of the Pale, and offers made by
</p>
<p>the chiefs of them to submit : and nothing was so likely to
</p>
<p>stop the effects of that disposition, as to treat those, who had
</p>
<p>actually submitted, in such a manner as to show the rest, that
</p>
<p>they should receive no favours upon such submission, nor any
</p>
<p>benefit by his majesty's proclamation. Hence all the gentle-
</p>
<p>men, who surrendered themselves, were, without being admitted
</p>
<p>to the presence of the justices, committed to the castle of Dublin;
</p>
<p>preparations were made for their trial, and designs published
</p>
<p>of their being prosecuted with the utmost severity. But as
</p>
<p>the prisoners had never appeared in the field, nor been con-
</p>
<p>cerned in any warlike action, there was a want of proper facts
</p>
<p>wherewith to charge them, and of sufficient witnesses to prove
</p>
<p>those facts. To supply both these defects, the lords justices
</p>
<p>had recourse to the rack, a detestable expedient, invented to
</p>
<p>extort from unhappy prisoners, in the anguish of their pain,

</p>
<p>" These measures served their own scheme of an extir-
</p>
<p>pation, by racking those gentlemen, whose treatment could
</p>
<p>not fail of deterring every body from venturing themselves into
</p>
<p>their power for the future." 66
</p>
<p>"These propositions, for putting the Roman Catholics of
</p>
<p>Ireland under, greater hardships than any they had ever com-
</p>
<p>plained of before, incapacitating them from all offices whatever,
</p>
<p>disabling them from sitting in Parliament, (a privilege which
</p>
<p>they had always enjoyed, and from which alone they could
</p>
<p>expect any redress of future grievances) forfeiting all their es-
</p>
<p>tates, real and personal, and yet obliging them, when their all,
</p>
<p>was taken from them, to make impossible reparations and sa-
</p>
<p>tisfactions for losses sustained, and devastations committed,
</p>
<p>in the war; suppressing their religion, banishing all their cler-
</p>
<p>gy, and nerv planting- the kingdom, were evidently calculated
</p>
<p>to hinder any peace at all ; and certainly came from some of
</p>
<p>that party of men which first formed the design of an extirpa-
</p>
<p>tion of the Roman Catholics, and, by publishing that design,
</p>
<p>made the rebellion so general as it proved at last. They all
</p>
<p>breathed the same spirit; and though extirpation both of nation
</p>
<p>and religion was not expressly mentioned, yet it seemed to be
</p>
<p>contrived effectually in all the propositions. They appeared
</p>
<p>so monstrous and unreasonable, that it was thought they could
</p>
<p>proceed from nothing but an high degree of madness or
</p>
<p>malice." 67
</p>
<p>" There is too much reason to think, that, as the lords jus-
</p>
<p>tices really wished the rebellion to spread, and more gentlemen
</p>
<p>of estates to be involved in it, that the forfeitures might be the
</p>
<p>greater, and a general plantation be carried on by a new set of
</p>
<p>English Protestants all over the kingdom, to the ruin and ex-
</p>

<p>in Ulster, on the 23d of October, 1641, and did
</p>
<p>not spread into the other provinces for several
</p>
<p>weeks : nor was it in any degree general, till late
</p>
<p>in December. Even at that period, there were
</p>
<p>very large portions of the country, particularly in
</p>
<p>Connaught and Munster, which were wholly free
</p>
<p>from rebellion, notwithstanding the efforts of the
</p>
<p>lords justices to goad them into it. Yet so early
</p>
<p>as the 16th of February, 1642, (that is, about two
</p>
<p>months afterwards) a company of adventurers
</p>
<p>was formed in London, who calculated on the
</p>
<p>forfeiture of the whole island, except what belonged
</p>
<p>to the Protestants. This extravagant project is
</p>
<p>fortunately recorded, at full length, in the Jour-
</p>
<p>nals of the English House of Commons. These
</p>
<p>adventurers presented an address to Parliament,
</p>
<p>stating, that when "the work of reducing the
</p>
<p>kingdom of Ireland" was " finished," there would
</p>
<p>be " of confiscated lands, such as go under the
</p>
<p>name of profitable lands," no less than " TEN
</p>
<p>MILLIONS OF ACRES ! !"
</p>
<p>According to Sir William Petty's calculation,
</p>
<p>there were but two-thirds of the surface of
</p>
<p>Ireland, which were called "profitable lands "
</p>
<p>the remaining third consisting of " highways,
</p>
<p>loughs, impassable bogs, rocks, shrubs, and
</p>
<p>coarse land." 69 As the whole contents of Ireland
</p>
<p>are only about nineteen millions of acres, it is
</p>
<p>clear, that nothing short of a general extirpation
</p>

</p>
<p>the " unprofitable lands," and the possessions of
</p>
<p>the Protestants, there would not remain above ten
</p>
<p>millions of acres.* This measure was adopted
</p>
<p>February 1, 1641-2.
</p>
<p>* Proposition made by divers gentlemen, citizens , and other 's,

<p>for the speedy and effectual reducing of the kingdom of Ire-

</p>
<p>1st. They do compute, that less than a million of money
</p>
<p>will not perfect that work.
</p>
<p>2nd. They do conceive, that the work being finished, there
</p>
<p>will be in that kingdom, of confiscated lands, such as go under
</p>
<p>the name of profitable lands, ten millions of acres, English
</p>
<p>measure.
</p>
<p>3d. That two millions and a half of those acres, to be equal-
</p>
<p>ly taken out of the four provinces, will sufficiently satisfy those
</p>
<p>that shall advance this million of money.
</p>
<p>4th. That the two millions and a half of acres may be di-
</p>
<p>vided amongst them after this proportion, viz.
</p>
<p>For each adventure of 200/. a thousand acres in Ulster.
</p>
<p>300/. a thousand acres in Connaught.
</p>
<p>450/. a thousand acres in Munster.
</p>
<p>6007. a thousand acres in Leinster.
</p>
<p>All English measure,
</p>
<p>Consisting of meadow, arable and profitable pasture; the bogs,
</p>
<p>woods, and barren mountains, being cast in, over and above.
</p>
<p>These two millions and a half of acres to be holden in free
</p>
<p>and common socage of the king, as of his castle of Dublin.
</p>
<p>5th. That out of these two millions and a half of acres, a
</p>
<p>constant rent shall be reserved to the crown of England, after
</p>
<p>this proportion, viz.
</p>
<p>Out of each acre thereof in

<p>from principles of Machiavelian policy, to drive
</p>
<p>the Catholics to desperation, by shutting the door
</p>
<p>against all hopes of retreat. Tyrants and con-
</p>
<p>querors, leading devastating armies in their train,
</p>
<p>have often grasped at millions of acres: but,
</p>
<p>throughout the wide range of the history of pri-
</p>
<p>vate spoil, there is no paraUel case, except, per-
</p>
<p>haps, in Hindostan, during the last hundred years.
</p>
<p>Ten millions of acres to be forfeited ! What an
</p>
<p>appalling idea this inspires of the deplorable state
</p>
<p>of the victims, and the inhumanity of those who
</p>
<p>offered them up as holocausts on the altars of
</p>
<p>rapine and bigotry !
</p>
<p>The English Parliament readily acquiesced in
</p>
<p>the proposal; and immediately passed an act,*
</p>
<p>for the purpose of carrying it into effect. But,
</p>
<p>as they probably felt ashamed to recognize the
</p>
<p>extravagant grasp at " ten millions of acres," they
</p>
<p>much improved, besides the advantage that he will have, by
</p>
<p>the coming to his hands of all other the lands of the rebels and
</p>
<p>their personal estates, without any charge to his majesty. 70
</p>
<p>* " Whereas, divers worthy and well affected persons, per-
</p>
<p>ceiving that many millions of acres of the rebels' lands of that
</p>
<p>kingdom, which go under the name of profitable lands, will bte
</p>
<p>confiscate and to be disposed of, and that in that case two mil-
</p>
<p>lions and a half of those acres, to be equally taken out of the
</p>
<p>four provinces of that kingdom, may be allotted for the satis-
</p>
<p>faction of such persons as shall disburse any sums of money,
</p>
<p>for the reducing of the rebels there, which would effectually
</p>
<p>accomplish the same, have made these propositions ensuing,"

<p>D P. 35. The Courcys, the Fitzstephenses, the
</p>
<p>Fitzgeralds.'] Many of the descendants of the
</p>
<p>early English settlers, being possessed of exorbi-
</p>
<p>tant wealth and immense territories, held out to
</p>
<p>the needy and rapacious deputies, who were sent
</p>
<p>to rule Ireland, stronger temptations to plunder
</p>
<p>than the aboriginals ; and hence they frequently
</p>
<p>experienced more dire oppression and cruelty
</p>
<p>than the latter.
</p>
<p>One very simple and very common mode of
</p>
<p>driving these great lords into what was called re-
</p>
<p>bellion, but what was merely affording the de-
</p>
<p>puties a pretence for making war, and commit-
</p>
<p>ting depredations on them, was to summon them,
</p>
<p>in an arbitrary manner, to appear before those
</p>
<p>rulers, or in parliament, where they had every
</p>
<p>prospect of being seized, and, under false pre-
</p>
<p>tences, thrown into prison, perhaps hanged or
</p>
<p>beheaded by martial law :* or, if they were deter-
</p>
<p>red from appearing, they were proclaimed as
</p>
<p>contumacious traitors, and " the dogs of war" let
</p>
<p>loose on them. There are numberless cases of
</p>
<p>* " Richard Bourke, called the Usule of Ireland, was at
</p>
<p>Castell ne Kelly hanged by martial law, information being there
</p>

</p>
<p>text of dutiful obedience, and visitation of the governor, in-
</p>
<p>tended to betray him and his company ." m

<p>this kind on record, of which, when I resume the
</p>
<p>subject, in a subsequent part of this work, I shall
</p>
<p>give some of the most striking. I confine myself,
</p>
<p>for the present, to a few, of which the chief is
</p>
<p>that of the earl of Desmond, whose large estates
</p>
<p>held out temptations to the rapacity of Ralph De
</p>
<p>Ufford, lord justice, who administered the gp-
</p>
<p>vernment, under Edward III.
</p>
<p>To this earl a summons was sent to attend
</p>
<p>parliament, with which he declined compliance.
</p>
<p>On this sole, this miserable pretext, the lord jus-
</p>
<p>tice immediately raised an army,* and, meeting
</p>
<p>with no resistance, seized all his vast possessions,
</p>
<p>* " This UfFort, lord justice, on pain of forfeiture of all his
</p>
<p>lands, commanded the earl of Desmond to make his personal
</p>
<p>appearance at a parliament which he called to be holden at
</p>
<p>Dublin, there to begin the seventh of June; and, because
</p>
<p>the earl refused to come, according to the summons, he raised
</p>
<p>the king's standard, and, -with an army, marched into Munster,
</p>
<p>and there seized the earl's possessions into the king's hands, let-
</p>
<p>ting them forth to farm, for an annual rent, unto other persons.
</p>
<p>And, whilst he yet remained in Munster, he devised ways
</p>
<p>how to have the earl of Desmond apprehended ; which being
</p>
<p>brought to pass, he afterwards delivered him upon mainprise
</p>
<p>of these sureties, whose names ensue: William De Burgh, earl
</p>
<p>of Ulster; James Butler, earl of Ormond; Richard Tute,
</p>
<p>Nicholas Verdon, Morice Rochford, Eustace Le Powre, Ge-

</p>
<p>and slaughtered his principal followers. He soon
</p>
<p>found means to seize the earl himself, and
</p>
<p>bound no less than twenty-seven of the nobility
</p>
<p>and gentry as sureties for his good behaviour.
</p>
<p>He afterwards summoned the earl before him,
</p>
<p>who, " finding his severity, thought it dangerous
</p>
<p>to appear, according to the condition of the re-
</p>
<p>cognizance, and therefore it was escheated into
</p>
<p>the exchequer." 73 Ufford rapaciously availed
</p>
<p>himself of this opportunity, and seized the estates
</p>
<p>of twenty-three of " the mainpernors" according
</p>
<p>to Hooker, or of eighteen, according to Cox.*
</p>
<p>Besides these acts of oppression, " he caused
</p>
<p>the earl of Kildare to be arrested, and committed
</p>
<p>to the castle of Dublin ;" 74 indicted and imprison-
</p>
<p>ed many others ; annulled a number of charters ;
</p>
<p>and " proceeded every way so roundly and se-
</p>
<p>verely, as the nobility, which were wont to suffer
</p>
<p>no controulment, did much distaste him." 75 This
</p>
<p>case affords a proof how little dependence can
</p>
<p>be placed on the accounts given of Irish affairs
</p>
<p>by English writers : for, of this odious oppres-
</p>
<p>sor, who was a mere Verres, and, according to
</p>
<p>And because he made default, "the lord justice verily took the
</p>
<p>advantage of the mainpernors, four of them only excepted, the
</p>
<p>two earls and two knights." 78
</p>
<p>* " Though the noblemen, and some of the knights, made a
</p>
<p>shift to get rid of this matter, yet eighteen of the knights lost
</p>
<p>their estates, and rvere utterly ruined thereby"

</p>
<p>persuasion (as was said) of his wife, more extreme
</p>
<p>and covetous than he otherwise would have

<p>been," 78 Sir John Davies says, " in troth, he was
</p>
<p>a singular good justicer." 79 Hollinshed does
</p>
<p>not pretend to deny his severity and rigour, but
</p>
<p>charges it wholly to the account of his wife, who
</p>
<p>was " bent to prick him forward unto sharp deal-

<p>ings, and rigorous proceedings." 30 And further,

<p>"His lady, it would appear, was verily but a

</p>
<p>The case of another earl of Desmond, two

<p>able. Henry Sydney, the lord deputy, thirsting

<p>most flimsy pretexts, and carried him in duress,

<p>in an extensive circuit he made through the
</p>
<p>country. The earl finally effected an escape ;
</p>
<p>and was peremptorily cited to appear before the
</p>
<p>earl, and to surrender his strongest fortresses.
</p>
<p>The ignominious treatment he had experienced,
</p>
<p>and the imminent danger he had escaped, deter-
</p>
<p>red him from confiding his person into the de-

<p>note.
</p>
<p>The injustice with which he was treated, will
</p>
<p>appear palpable, from two of the items of the
</p>
<p>proclamation, by one of which he was charged
</p>
<p>with seeking for foreign and domestic aid ;* and,
</p>
<p>by another, at the same time, with destroying his
</p>
<p>castles, and burning his towns,f " to the intent her
</p>
<p>majesty's forces and subjects should not be suc-
</p>
<p>coured nor refreshed." /
</p>
<p>It is difficult to decide whether the wickedness
</p>
<p>or absurdity of these accusations is the greater.
</p>
<p>If he intended to enter into rebellion, it would
</p>
<p>have been the quintessence of madness to destroy
</p>
<p>his castles. The one effectually destroys the
</p>
<p>other.
</p>
<p>It does not fall within my present view, to
</p>
<p>enter into detail on the progress of this war.
</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, that the earl was reduced to a
</p>
<p>most deplorable state of wretchedness ; finally
</p>
<p>assassinated in a filthy cabin; and his estate,
</p>
<p>which consisted of five hundred and seventy-four

<p>of foreigners, and daily soliciteth the chief men of the Irish

<p>" Great were the .services which these garrisons performed :

</p>
<p>And, from the scenes recorded by Hooker,
</p>
<p>Spencer, and Cox, ihrnay be said, without exag-
</p>
<p>geration, that Ireland, for a long period, was lite-
</p>
<p>rally a great human slaughter-house, where the
</p>
<p>natives were hunted down and butchered like so
</p>
<p>many wild beasts, and where many of the rulers
</p>
<p>appeared under as hideous an aspect as was ever
</p>
<p>displayed in any country, or at any period. Should
</p>
<p>this declaration appear to the reader too highly
</p>
<p>coloured, he has only to read the annexed proofs,
</p>
<p>to remove all his doubts.
</p>
<p>The wanton and wicked destruction of the
</p>
<p>fruits of the earth, expressly ordered and carried
</p>
<p>into effect to produce famine, was as fatal to the
</p>
<p>Irish, as the havoc made of the human species in
</p>
<p>the field of battle, or on the defenceless of both
</p>
<p>sexes and every age, throughout their caverns
</p>
<p>and hiding-places, where they were remorselessly
</p>
<p>pursued. It fulfilled the intentions of the' victors,
</p>
<p>and created a most deplorable famine, whereby
</p>
<p>scenes of misery were produced, of which the
</p>
<p>examples are rare.* The natives were driven,
</p>
<p>" Captain Francis Slingsby, with five hundred foot, burned,

<p>as Hooker states, not only to eat horses, dogs,
</p>
<p>and dead carrion, but human flesh, and even to
</p>
<p>take carcasses from their graves.* It is a fact
</p>
<p>manifest, that some older people had been in that starving con-
</p>
<p>dition, that they murdered and eat children, for a long time
</p>
<p>together, and were at last discovered and executed for that
</p>
<p>barbarity. In short, the famine of Jerusalem did net exceed
</p>
<p>that amongst the rebels of Ireland" 9 ''
</p>
<p>* " And as for the great companies of soldiers, gallowglas-
</p>
<p>ses, kerne, and the common people, who followed this rebellion,
</p>
<p>the numbers of them are infinite,, whose bloods the earth drank
</p>
<p>up, and whose carcasses the fowls of the air and the ravening
</p>
<p>beasts of the field did consume and devour. After this followed
</p>
<p>an extreme famine : and such whom the sword did not destroy,
</p>
<p>the same did consume and eat out ; very few or none remaining
</p>
<p>alive, excepting such as were fled over into England : and yet
</p>
<p>the store in the towns was far spent, and they in distress, al-
</p>
<p>beit nothing like in comparison to them who lived at large ;
</p>
<p>for they were not only driven to eat horses, dogs, and dead car-
</p>
<p>rions ; but also did devour the carcasses of dead men, whereof
</p>
<p>there be sundry examples ; namely, one in the county of Cork,
</p>
<p>where, -when a malefactor was executed to death, and his body
</p>
<p>left upon the gallows, certain poor people secretly came, took him
</p>
<p>down, and did eat him; likewise in the bay of Smeereweeke, or
</p>
<p>St. Marieweeke, the place which was first seasoned with this
</p>
<p>rebellion, there happened a ship to be there lost, through foul
</p>
<p>weather, and all the men being drowned, were there cast on

<p>land.

<p>pets, orewads, and such shell-fish as they could find, and which
</p>
<p>were now spent ; as soon as they saw these bodies, they took
</p>
<p>them up, and most greedily did eat and devoure them : and not

<p>long after, death and famine did eat and consume them. The

<p>worthy of observation, that Spencer coolly and
</p>
<p>deliberately proposed a plan for reducing the
</p>
<p>country, by the introduction of a new famine,
</p>
<p>which would force the natives " to devour one an-
</p>
<p>other"* and renew the horrible scenes that had
</p>
<p>ous of corne, full of cattell, well stored with fish and sundrie

<p>other good commodities, is now become -waste and barren,
</p>
<p>yielding no fruits, the pastures no cattell, the fields no corne,
</p>
<p>the aire no birds, the seas (though full of fish) yet to them
</p>
<p>yielding nothing. Finallie, every waie the curse of God was
</p>
<p>so great, and the land so barren both of man and beast, that
</p>
<p>whosoever did travell from the one end to the other of all
</p>
<p>Munster, even from Waterford to the head of Smeerweeke,
</p>
<p>which is about six score miles, he -would not meet ante man,
</p>
<p>woman, or child, saving in townes and cities ; nor yet see anie

<p>beast, but the very wolves, the foxes, and other like ravening

<p>beasts ; many of them laie dead, being famished, and the re-

<p>sidue gone elsewhere." 98
</p>
<p>* " The end will (I assure me) bee very short, and much
</p>
<p>sooner than it can be in so great a trouble, as it seemeth hoped

<p>for, although there should none of them fall by the sword, nor

</p>
<p>no longer honest and obedient, than that they cannot be suf-
</p>
<p>fered to be rebels. Such is their stubbornness and pride, that

<p>with a continual fear it must be bridled ; and such is the hard-

<p>ness of their hearts, that with the rod it must still be chastised

<p>longer than they be ruled with severity, no longer will they be

</p>
<p>torical flourish, calculated to delude or to deceive
</p>
<p>the reader. It is a melancholy and heart-rending
</p>
<p>truth, that such was the depraved and deplorable

<p>state of the morality of the administration in Ire-

<p>of corruption carried on, so totally lost were

<p>the privy council to all sense of principle and
</p>
<p>decency, and so well was their character esta-

<p>blished on this point, that one of the agents em-
</p>
<p>ployed in the business of subornation, actually
</p>
<p>applied to them, in their public capacity, for the
</p>
<p>wages of his iniquity. This single fact, establish-

<p>much hurry in the finding of these indictments, (of which above

<p>nation of each particular case, and they were too generally

<p>Ireland is an exception to all the general rules on

<p>investigation, by nine-tenths of those who have

<p>written on English or Irish affairs : and there are
</p>
<p>in this country, as well as in England, many, even

<p>among those who pride themselves on the extent

<p>of their reading, who are so far duped as to give

<p>his own writing, of a passage in the Council, on April 23, 1643.
</p>
<p>There was then a letter read at the Board, from a person who
</p>
<p>claimed a great merit to himself, in getting some hundreds of
</p>
<p>gentlemen indicted, and the rather for that he had laid out sums
</p>
<p>of money to procure witnesses to give evidence to a jury, for

<p>the finding those indictments. This was an intimate friend of

<p>Sir William Parsons, and might very well know that such

</p>
<p>of 1688, or the accession of the Hanoverian fa-
</p>
<p>mily to the throne of England.
</p>
<p>I trust the reader will well weigh, and ponder
</p>
<p>on, the naked detail contained in the preceding
</p>
<p>note, which exhibits a scene of atrocity unparal-
</p>
<p>leled in the history of fraud, forgery, and perjury.
</p>
<p>What a stupendous, what a sickening fact is the
</p>
<p>finding of one thousand bills of indictment in two
</p>
<p>days ! And, be it observed, these bills were prin-
</p>
<p>cipally against the wealthy classes, the " noble-
</p>
<p>men, gentlemen, and freeholders." 105 These were
</p>
<p>the men whom it was worth while to indict,
</p>
<p>men whose estates would recompense the trou-
</p>
<p>ble, pay for the subornation of hired witnesses,
</p>
<p>and sate the avarice of the prime movers of the

<p>business.
</p>
<p>Above one thousand bills of indictment in two

</p>
<p>day, from six in the morning till six in the even-
</p>

</p>
<p>it was at the rate of forty-two bills in an hour,
</p>
<p>or two every three minutes. Well may Carte
</p>
<p>observe, that they did not " allow time for the
</p>
<p>examination of each particular case." This is a
</p>
<p>most feeble mode of stating the affair, which he

<p>est reprobation. He might have said, and with

<p>to sign them." They must have been huddled
</p>
<p>over en masse, barely reading the titles, mark-
</p>
<p>ing them true bills, (how true, heaven knows)
</p>
<p>and annexing the names of the jurors.
</p>
<p>And these bills of indictment (who can read
</p>
<p>the fact without shuddering?) decided on the
</p>
<p>lives and fortunes of the principal of the " nobili-
</p>
<p>ty, gentry, and freeholders" of Ireland, of whom,
</p>
<p>on these, and indictments equally just and honour-

<p>able, " two thousand were prosecuted to outlawry

<p>by Sir Philip Percival, clerk of the crown," 106

<p>and their estates confiscated.
</p>
<p>Will it be deemed extravagant, to assert that
</p>
<p>the annals of the world can produce no similar
</p>
<p>circumstance, and that never was rampant and
</p>
<p>profligate injustice so completely triumphant ?
</p>
<p>This was the time, when, in those halls nick-
</p>
<p>named courts of justice, " the benches," (to use
</p>
<p>the strong and energetic language of the duke of

<p>Ormond, in his speech to the Irish Parliament)

<p>and wicked-height of those who ought rather to

</p>
<p>may not be improper, indeed it appears indis-
</p>
<p>pensable, to consider what is the nature of a bill
</p>
<p>of indictment, what are the duties of a grand jury
</p>
<p>who are to decide on it, and what are its conse-
</p>
<p>quences ? Answers to these inquiries will bring
</p>
<p>the subject so fully before the reader, as to
</p>
<p>awaken him to the true character of the proce-
</p>
<p>dure which has occupied the chief place in this
</p>
<p>chapter.
</p>
<p>According to Jacob's Law Dictionary, "An in-
</p>
<p>dictment is an inquisition taken and made by
</p>
<p>twelve men at the least, who are thereunto sworn,
</p>
<p>whereby they find and present that such a person,
</p>
<p>of such a place, in such a county, and of such a
</p>
<p>degree, hath committed such a treason, felony,
</p>
<p>trespass, or other offence, against the peace of the
</p>
<p>king, his crown, and dignity." 108
</p>
<p>The accusation is delivered to the grand jury,
</p>
<p>who are SWORN to determine on the probable
</p>
<p>guilt or innocence of the party accused, according
</p>
<p>to the evidence brought by the proper officer to
</p>
<p>support the charge.
</p>
<p>Could the jury, who thus found trrcKhousand
</p>
<p>bills of indictment in two days, have heard the
</p>
<p>evidence ? Certainly not. Did they not there-
</p>
<p>fore violate their oaths ? Yes. What were they
</p>
<p>then ? Perjurers. Was not the blood of every
</p>
<p>man, whom then- perjury led to the scaffold, on
</p>
<p>their heads ? Indubitably.

</p>
<p>Were not the judges under oath to administer
</p>
<p>justice correctly ? When they received such bills,
</p>
<p>were they not likewise perjured ? Was not the
</p>
<p>blood of the victims equally to be laid to their
</p>
<p>charge? Most assuredly.
</p>
<p>In ordinary cases, the perjuries of grand juries,
</p>
<p>however flagitious, are of no great importance,
</p>
<p>but as respects their own guilt, provided the tra-
</p>
<p>verse juries be upright and independent. "Not so
</p>
<p>in that horrible age of perjury. There was hardly
</p>
<p>any traverse jury used : for the dread of the rack,
</p>
<p>and the exercise of martial law,* had so terrified
</p>
<p>the Roman Catholics, that they did not dare to
</p>
<p>venture into Dublin,f which was a complete den
</p>
<p>of murder.
</p>
<p>* " The prisons of that city [Dublin] were now filled with
</p>
<p>prisoners : and, as the government increased in strength, were
</p>
<p>likely to be more crowded every day. It was troublesome,
</p>
<p>chargeable, and inconvenient to keep them, because of the con-
</p>
<p>sumption which it occasioned of victuals ; which were already
</p>
<p>grown very scarce, and their numbers might prove dangerous,
</p>
<p>for which reason the lords justices resolved to thin them. It
</p>
<p>was difficult, or rather impossible, for want of freeholders, to
</p>
<p>find juries in the proper counties where the crimes were acted ;
</p>
<p>so that there was no bringing these persons to a legal trial. In
</p>
<p>this necessity, it was determined to cause a considerable num-
</p>
<p>ber of them to be executed by martial law." 109
</p>
<p>f " It was certainly a miserable spectacle, to see every day
</p>
<p>numbers of people executed by martial law, at the discretion, or
</p>
<p>rather caprice, of Sir Charles Coote, a hot-headed and bloody
</p>
<p>man, and as such accounted even by the English and Protes-
</p>
<p>tants. Yet this was the man whom the lords justices picked

<p>This inference further follows, from the strong
</p>
<p>and unequivocal circumstance, that of three thou-
</p>
<p>sand persons indicted, as above stated, by Sir Phi-
</p>
<p>lip Percival, there were two-thirds who did not
</p>
<p>appear, and were prosecuted to outlawry in then-
</p>
<p>absence.* Thus, for those two thousand men,
</p>
<p>there was no more use of a traverse jury than if
</p>
<p>no such body ever existed.
</p>
<p>Would that I had the tongue of a Demosthenes,
</p>
<p>or a Curran, or a Henry, or the pen of a Burke
</p>
<p>or a Dickinson, to spread this truth before an
</p>
<p>astounded world, that, on this species of evidence,
</p>
<p>one foul, bloated mass of fraud and perjury, rests
</p>
<p>the thousand-times-told story of " the execrable
</p>
<p>Irish Rebellion." The man who, knowing theSe

<p>death rebels and traitors, that is, all such as he should deem
</p>
<p>to be so ; which he performed with delight, and a wanton kind
</p>
<p>of cruelty : and yet, all this while, the justices sat in council ;
</p>
<p>and the judges, in the usual season, sat in their respective
</p>
<p>courts, spectators of, and countenancing, so extravagant a tri-
</p>
<p>bunal as Sir Charles Coote's, and so illegal an execution of

<p>justice." 110

<p>with great vigour, causing indictments to be preferred not only
</p>
<p>against open and declared rebels, but also against others -who
</p>
<p>were barely suspected: and, as there was nobody to make de-
</p>
<p>fence, nor any great delicacy used, either in the choice of the

<p>aggrandized themselves to the full extent of their

<p>be : and though it is almost too late to correct the
</p>
<p>prevalent errors on the subject, to wash away the
</p>
<p>foul stains which avarice, religious bigotry, and
</p>
<p>national rancour, impressed on the sufferers, and
</p>
<p>though I may not therefore fully succeed, yet the
</p>
<p>attempt to effect these great objects can hardly
</p>
<p>be otherwise than useful.
</p>
<p>Charles I. a bigot and a despot by education,
</p>
<p>wickedly endeavoured to force a new religion on
</p>
<p>the Scotch. In this, he only followed the exam-
</p>
<p>ples of his predecessors, Henry, Edward, Mary,
</p>
<p>and Elizabeth, who had successively either forced
</p>
<p>or persuaded their servile parliaments four times,
</p>
<p>in the course of about thirty years, to change
</p>
<p>the established religion.
</p>
<p>Let it be observed, however, that the new
</p>
<p>religion was not the antipodes of the old one, as
</p>
<p>had been the. case with the changes of Edward,
</p>
<p>Mary, and Elizabeth. The new religion bore
</p>
<p>many kindred features of the old : in points of
</p>
<p>doctrine they were nearly sisters, although there
</p>
<p>was the most marked difference in the church
</p>
<p>government. But I repeat, the difference be-
</p>
<p>tween the religion that Edward, Mary, and Eli-
</p>
<p>zabeth found " by law established" and that they
</p>
<p>" established by law" was incalculably greater
</p>
<p>than between the religion of Scotland at the ac-
</p>
<p>cession of Charles I. and the religion he attempt-

<p>ed to force on his subjects.

</p>
<p>An important consideration must not be passed
</p>
<p>over here. The Scotch laboured under hardly
</p>
<p>any other grievance than the contemplated inno-
</p>
<p>vation in their religion : their persons and pro-
</p>
<p>perty were sacred.
</p>
<p>They resisted the despotic and wicked inter-
</p>
<p>ference between them and their God : they
</p>
<p>were in the right : their cause was good. It is
</p>
<p>not given by the living God to any of the sons of
</p>
<p>men to force the religious worship of his fellow-
</p>
<p>men ; and the attempt to change their religious
</p>
<p>opinions, is as transcendently absurd as would be
</p>
<p>the effort to " change the hue of the dusky Ethi-
</p>
<p>op." Brutal force, as has been long since ob-
</p>
<p>served, may coerce men into apparent conformity ;
</p>
<p>but it never made a convert yet, and never will:
</p>
<p>it is fated to produce only martyrs or hypocrites.
</p>
<p>The evil destiny of Charles induced him to
</p>
<p>raise forces to subdue the refractory Scotch.
</p>
<p>They obeyed the first law of human nature, the
</p>
<p>law of self-preservation. They raised forces to
</p>
<p>defend themselves ; and finally triumphed over
</p>
<p>the aggressor, and extorted from him a grant of
</p>
<p>every demand they chose to make. He was to-
</p>
<p>tally foiled ; and retired from the contest, over-
</p>
<p>whelmed with shame and disgrace.
</p>
<p>What has been the result, as respects the

<p>who embarked in a holy cause, and were resolved
</p>
<p>to die or be free.
</p>
<p>In 1642, a civil war took place in England, on
</p>
<p>various grounds, into the detail of which it is ir-
</p>
<p>relevant to my present purpose to enter. That
</p>
<p>Charles I. was, in the first fifteen years of his
</p>
<p>reign, an arbitrary despot, that the proceedings
</p>
<p>in the Star-Chamber Court were equally tyrannical
</p>
<p>and cruel, that the fines in that court were op-
</p>
<p>pressive, the punishments frequently most barbar-
</p>
<p>ous, the exactions of ship-money, tonnage, and
</p>
<p>poundage, illegal and unjust; and that they requir-
</p>
<p>ed and justified resistance, none but a cringing
</p>
<p>slave, deserving of the despot's lash, will deny.
</p>
<p>But it is impossible to read the history of -that dark
</p>
<p>and disastrous period, with calmness and candour,
</p>
<p>without being convinced that all the substantial
</p>
<p>grievances of the nation were removed, and am-
</p>
<p>ply-adequate mounds established to guard against
</p>
<p>a recurrence of them, before a single soldier was
</p>
<p>raised, a single drop of blood shed, or a single
</p>
<p>step taken towards civil war or rebellion. In no
</p>
<p>country whatever was liberty more adequately
</p>
<p>secured, than it was by the laws enacted from the
</p>
<p>commencement of the Long Parliament, in No-
</p>
<p>vember, 1640, till February, 1642. With every
</p>
<p>demand of Parliament during that period, Charles
</p>
<p>complied ; sometimes, it is true, very reluctantly,

<p>and with an ill grace. But, till then' claim of the

<p>The English, nevertheless, took up arms. Civil

<p>war spread its horrors over the nation, with its
</p>
<p>hideous train of demoralization and devastation.
</p>
<p>Torrents of blood were shed ; conflagration, rape,
</p>
<p>rapine, and murder, prowled at large ; the foun-
</p>
<p>dations of society were shaken : and the melan-

<p>choly result was, to place the sceptre in the hand,

<p>and the crown on the head, of Cromwell, an un-

</p>
<p>to establish passive obedience and non-resistance,

<p>by an odious positive law, under one of the most

</p>
<p>a seven years' war, the failure of a noble expe-
</p>
<p>riment in favour of the rights of human nature,
</p>
<p>as well as the triumph they afforded to the friends
</p>
<p>of absolute power, by the odious abuse of liberty.
</p>
<p>These stains can never be washed away.
</p>
<p>What has been the result as to the actors on
</p>
<p>this stage ?
</p>
<p>They are to this day regarded with the highest
</p>
<p>veneration, by the most enlightened part of man-
</p>
<p>kind. Their follies, their vices, their crimes, are
</p>
<p>buried in eternal oblivion. Their resistance to
</p>
<p>lawless tyranny has immortalized them.
</p>
<p>The Irish, at the same period, suffered almost
</p>
<p>every species of the most grinding, odious, and
</p>
<p>revolting despotism that can be conceived. They
</p>
<p>were subjected to heavy penalties, for worship-
</p>
<p>ping God according to the dictates of their con-
</p>
<p>sciences, or for not attending #n a worship which
</p>
<p>they were taught to execrate ; they were robbed
</p>
<p>of their estates by high-handed and flagitious
</p>
<p>tyranny and fraud ; they were subject to martial
</p>
<p>law, with aH its horrors, in time of profound
</p>
<p>peace ; their juries were ruinously fined, and
</p>
<p>mutilated in their persons, for not finding ver-
</p>
<p>dicts against the plainest dictates of justice ; their
</p>
<p>churches were demolished, or rapaciously seized
</p>
<p>by their oppressors ; their children were torn
</p>
<p>from their natural guardians, and transferred to
</p>
<p>the care of worthless strangers, who squandered
</p>
<p>their estates, and brought them up in habits of

<p>ceive of any species of oppression which they
</p>
<p>did not endure.
</p>
<p>They were goaded into insurrection. And if
</p>
<p>ever resistance of lawless outrage and tyranny
</p>
<p>were loudly and imperiously called for, if ever
</p>
<p>the standard of freedom claimed the sympathies
</p>
<p>of mankind, the Irish standard had an indisputable
</p>
<p>title to it. And what has been the result ? Their
</p>
<p>most illustrious families were reduced to beggary;
</p>
<p>their estates, to the amount of millions of acres,
</p>
<p>were confiscated ; above half a million of the na-
</p>
<p>tives were slaughtered, banished, or perished by
</p>
<p>famine and the plague,* the consequence of the
</p>
<p>ruthless and savage ferocity with which they were
</p>
<p>pursued by their enemies ; and they were covered
</p>
<p>with obloquy and abuse, during their lives ; their
</p>
<p>memory has been detested ; and the crimes false-
</p>
<p>ly alleged against them, have been visited upon
</p>
<p>their descendants to the fourth and fifth genera-

<p>The reader is requested to suspend his opinion
</p>
<p>on the subject of this statement, which is proba-

<p>bly diametrically opposite to the opinions he has

<p>and overwhelming.
</p>
<p>On the subject of the monstrous, absurd, im-
</p>
<p>probable, and impossible legends of the massacre
</p>
<p>by the Irish, I have already slightly touched, and
</p>
<p>shall reserve for future chapters a more full de-
</p>
<p>tection of them. I now confine myself to the sim-
</p>
<p>ple circumstance of the insurrection itself, strip-
</p>
<p>ped of all its horrors, real or pretended. And I
</p>
<p>dare aver, that if ever, from the creation of the
</p>
<p>world, there was a holy, sacred insurrection, an
</p>
<p>insurrection warranted by every law, divine or
</p>
<p>human, this was pre-eminently so. Further : if
</p>
<p>the leaders of the Irish insurgents, who attempted
</p>
<p>to shake off the tyranny of England, were traitors
</p>
<p>and rebels, then were William Tell, Maurice,
</p>
<p>Prince of Orange, Pym, Hambden, and Sydney,
</p>
<p>traitors and rebels. One step further : if these
</p>
<p>Irishmen were traitors and rebels, Randolph,
</p>
<p>Henry, Hancock, Adams, Dickinson, Livingston,
</p>
<p>Lee, Rutledge, Clinton, and Washington himself,
</p>
<p>were traitors and rebels ; and not merely traitors
</p>
<p>and rebels, but traitors and rebels of the most
</p>
<p>atrocious kind ; as the difference between the
</p>
<p>grievances that Washington and his illustrious
</p>
<p>compeers rose to redress, and those under which
</p>
<p>Ireland groaned, is very nearly as great as that
</p>
<p>between the liberty and happiness of an American

</p>
<p>This is strong language, which will doubtless
</p>
<p>be in direct hostility with the prejudices of a large
</p>
<p>portion of my readers. From then* prejudices,
</p>
<p>I appeal to their reason and candour ; and if the
</p>
<p>decision be made by these respectable arbiters, 1
</p>
<p>feel no doubt about the issue. For, to confine
</p>
<p>myself to the American revolution, will any man,
</p>
<p>not lost to decency or common sense, dare to
</p>
<p>commit himself, by comparing the grievances of
</p>
<p>America with those of Ireland? a two-penny
</p>
<p>tax on tea, with the court of wards, the Star-
</p>
<p>Chamber, the high commission court, the flagiti-
</p>
<p>ous plunder of the whole province of Ulster, the
</p>
<p>attempt to confiscate the whole province of Con-
</p>
<p>naught, the seizure of their churches, the banish-
</p>
<p>ment of their priests, the persecution of their re-
</p>
<p>ligion, the restriction of their trade, the execution
</p>
<p>of martial law, in a word, the endless detail of
</p>
<p>the most grievous oppression on record ? If then
</p>
<p>the despotic and lawless imposition of a paltry tax
</p>
<p>on tea, warranted the subject in drawing the sword,
</p>
<p>and commencing a civil war, surely it is not as-
</p>
<p>suming much, to say that the oppressions of

<p>passed in the English House of Commons, which

</p>
<p>Thus that very Parliament which so rancorous-
</p>
<p>ly pursued the.Irislvto their utter ruin, and to the
</p>
<p>scaffold, for resistance to tyranny, lavished the
</p>
<p>wealth of their constituents on the Scotch, for
</p>
<p>similar resistance, without a tenth part of the
</p>
<p>provocation. If this do not warrant the motto
</p>
<p>of the crows and the pigeons, at the head of this
</p>
<p>chapter, it is truly wonderful.
</p>
<p>A singular circumstance occurred, on taking
</p>
<p>the vote for the " brotherly assistance." Mr. Jer-
</p>
<p>vase Hollis, in a debate on the best and speediest
</p>
<p>means of their payment, having said, " that he
</p>
<p>knew no better or fitter than by English arms to
</p>
<p>expel them the kingdom," was called to the bar,
</p>
<p>and expelled the house. 114
</p>
<p>Times soon changed. The Scotch, then such
</p>
<p>favourites, fell into disgrace in a few years. By

<p>State of Ireland, under James, I. and Charles I.

<p>PREVIOUS to entering on the discussion of
</p>
<p>the insurrection of l$4l, it is highly proper to
</p>
<p>cast a glance on the state of the nation previous
</p>
<p>to that event.
</p>
<p>In order to aggravate as much as possible the
</p>
<p>guilt of the Irish, in what is styled " the execrable
</p>
<p>rebellion of 1641," and more completely to ex-
</p>
<p>pose them to detestation, almost every writer,
</p>
<p>who has either professedly treated this subject,
</p>
<p>or touched it incidentally, has drawn a most flat-
</p>
<p>tering picture of the peace, prosperity, and hap-
</p>
<p>piness of Ireland, for forty previous years. It
</p>
<p>requires no deep research to discover, that the
</p>
<p>motive is to inspire a belief, that the insurrection
</p>
<p>was as wanton and unprovoked in its origin, as
</p>
<p>they have endeavoured to make it appear bar-
</p>
<p>barous and sanguinary in its progress.

<p>In this object they have been crowned with
</p>
<p>success : for the general impression is, that Ire-
</p>
<p>land, during the reigns of James I. and his son
</p>
<p>Charles I. enjoyed a high degree of prosperity,
</p>
<p>to which she has been an utter stranger, from the
</p>
<p>day of the invasion by Henry II. when lust and
</p>
<p>faction laid the island prostrate at the feet of a
</p>
<p>foreign foe, to the present hour.
</p>
<p>Sir John Temple first broached this deceptious
</p>
<p>tale. He states, that for forty years the two na-
</p>
<p>tions had lived together in peace, and been con-
</p>
<p>solidated into one body, as one nation ; that the
</p>
<p>Roman Catholics enjoyed the private exercise of
</p>
<p>their religious rites without molestation ; and that
</p>
<p>none of the penalties of the laws against their re-
</p>
<p>ligion were inflicted.*
</p>
<p>* " The two nations had now lived together forty years ii\
</p>
<p>peace, with great security and comfort, which had in a manner
</p>
<p>consolidated them into one body, knit and compacted together
</p>
<p>with all those bonds and ligatures of friendship, alliance, and
</p>
<p>consanguinity, as might make up a constant and perpetual
</p>
<p>union between them.
</p>
<p>" Their priests, Jesuits, and friars, without any manner of
</p>
<p>restraint^ had quietly settled themselves in all the chief towns,
</p>
<p>villages, noblemen's and private gentlemen's houses, through-
</p>
<p>out the kingdom: so as the private exercise of ALL. THEIR
</p>
<p>RELIGIOUS RITES AND CEREMONIES was freely enjoyed by
</p>
<p>them, without any manner of disturbance, and not any of the
</p>
<p>laws put in execution, whereby heavy penalties were to be
</p>
<p>inflicted upon transgressors in that kind." 118

<p>known to them by their names. Whatsoever their land, labour,

<p>or industry produced was their own, being not only free from

<p>fear of having it taken from them by the king, upon any pre-
</p>
<p>tence whatsoever, without their own consent ; but also secured
</p>
<p>against thieves and robbers, by due execution of good laws,
</p>
<p>that men might and did travel over all the parts of the king-
</p>
<p>dom, with great sums of money, unguarded and unconcealed.
</p>
<p>" The whole nation enjoyed an undisturbed exercise of their
</p>
<p>religion : and even in Dublin, where the seat of the king's chief
</p>
<p>governor was, they went as publicly and uninterruptedly to
</p>
<p>their devotions, as he went to his. The bishops, priests, and
</p>
<p>all degrees and orders of secular and regular clergy, were
</p>
<p>known to be, and exercise their functions amongst them : and
</p>
<p>though there were some laws against them still in force, which
</p>
<p>necessity and the wisdom of former ages had caused to be
</p>
<p>enacted, to suppress those acts of treason and rebellion which
</p>
<p>the people frequently fell into, and the policy of present times
</p>
<p>kept unrepealed, to prevent the like distempers and designs,
</p>
<p>yet the edge of those laws was so totally rebated by the cle-
</p>
<p>mency and compassion of the king, that NO MAN COULD SAY
</p>
<p>HE HAD SUFFERED PREJUDICE OR DISTURBANCE ON AC-
</p>

</p>
<p>than subjects professing a faith contrary to what is established

<p>by the law of the land, can boast of in any other kingdom of

<p>trafficking with one another, during the whole happy reign of

<p>freely borrow not merely each other's sentiments,
</p>
<p>but their very phraseology. Lord Clarendon and
</p>
<p>Warner go much farther than the others ; who,
</p>
<p>so far as religion is concerned in the question,
</p>
<p>only assert that the private exercise of it was
</p>
<p>permitted; whereas, lord Clarendon asserts, in
</p>
<p>the most unqualified manner, that the whole na-
</p>
<p>tion enjoyed an undisturbed exercise of their reli-
</p>
<p>gion : and even in Dublin, they went as publicly
</p>
<p>and as uninterruptedly to their devotions, as the
</p>
<p>king's chief governor himself to his. Warner bor-
</p>
<p>rows this sentiment from lord Clarendon, but
</p>
<p>qualifies it in a small degree. He says " they
</p>
<p>went, though not as publicly, yet as uninterrupt-
</p>
<p>edly, as the governor to their devotions"
</p>
<p>To this statement, the doctor makes, with
</p>
<p>Clarendon, this extraordinary addition ; that " the
</p>
<p>edge of the laws against the Roman Catholics
</p>
<p>was so totally rebated by the lenity of the go-
</p>
<p>vernment, that not a single man could say that
</p>
<p>he had suffered any prejudice or disturbance for
</p>
<p>and the English seemed to have been buried, and both nations
</p>
<p>cemented, and as it were consolidated together, by intermar-
</p>
<p>riages, alliances, consanguinity, gossippings, and festerings,
</p>
<p>(the two last being relations of great force and dearness among
</p>
<p>the Irish) and by a continued intercourse of acts of hospitality,
</p>
<p>service, and friendship : lands had been improved, traffic in-
</p>
<p>creased, and the kingdom in general raised to a more flourish-
</p>
<p>ing condition than it had ever known. THE ROMAN CATHO-
</p>
<p>LICS ENJOYED THE QJJIET EXERCISE OF THEIR RELIGION, IN

<p>A PRIVATE WAY." 121

<p>POINTS I. $ II.
</p>
<p>To prove these points, 1 refer first to Leland.
</p>
<p>who states, that " when bills of indictment were
</p>
<p>presented against recusants, and were not found
</p>
<p>by the grand juries, those grand juries were cited
</p>
<p>to appear in the Star-Chamber, and punished."*
</p>
<p>The good doctor informs us, with great gra-
</p>
<p>vity, and an appearance of astonishment, that
</p>
<p>this severity " only increased the clamour." It is
</p>
<p>truly wonderful, and displays, beyond ah 1 ques-
</p>
<p>tion, the very refractory temper of the Irish, that
</p>
<p>they should have c; clamoured" against such a mild
</p>
<p>exercise of the prerogative, as punishing grand
</p>
<p>juries, with the ordinary clemency of the Star-
</p>
<p>Chamber Court T A for the heinous offence of not
</p>
<p>finding bills of indictment against persons refus-
</p>
<p>ing to take the oath of supremacy, or attending
</p>
<p>on a species of worship contrary to their con-
</p>
<p>sciences !
</p>
<p>The doctor further informs us, that the deputy,
</p>
<p>Oliver St. John, being actuated by peculiar zeal
</p>
<p>against Popery, or perhaps provoked by the in-
</p>
<p>solence of the recusant party, "proceeded to a

<p>vigorous execution of the penal statutes against
</p>
<p>them."*
</p>
<p>We are left to conjecture what was the species
</p>
<p>of insolence that thus led this amiable first ma-
</p>
<p>gistrate to the " vigorous execution" of these mild
</p>
<p>statutes. It was, perhaps, that they had the au-
</p>
<p>dacity to celebrate divine worship openly, or were
</p>
<p>guilty of some other crime, equally atrocious.
</p>
<p>But it is unimportant to our present purpose to
</p>
<p>inquire into the cause. All I desire to establish,
</p>
<p>is, that these penal statutes were " vigorously exe-
</p>
<p>cuted," in order to disprove the allegation that
</p>
<p>the Roman Catholics had for forty years " the
</p>
<p>undisturbed exercise of their religion" or even
</p>
<p>"fully enjoyed the private exercise of it" But I
</p>
<p>do not, although I might, rely wholly on Leland.
</p>
<p>To support the reverend divine, I appeal to Carte,
</p>
<p>who informs us that Oliver St. John " caused pre-
</p>
<p>sentments to be made, in different parts of the
</p>
<p>kingdom, of such as neglected coming to church
</p>
<p>on Sundays" 12 * It is not difficult to calculate
</p>
<p>what a harvest of penalties was reaped by petti-
</p>
<p>fogging magistrates, and by the pimps, spies, and
</p>
<p>detestable race of informers, from these "present-
</p>
<p>* " Whether provoked by the insolence of the recusant party,
</p>
<p>or that his nature and principles disposed him to treat them
</p>
<p>with less lenity than they had for some time experienced, HE
</p>
<p>SOON PROCEEDED TO A VIGOROUS EXECUTION OF THE PENAL
</p>
<p>STATUTES." 125

<p>fact before his eyes, derived from the best autho-
</p>
<p>rity, Leland affords an example of the most un-
</p>
<p>accountable inaccuracy, to use no stronger lan-

<p>guage. He informs us, that the annual amount

<p>of fines imposed on recusants in the county of

<p>Dublin, during the administration of lord Chiches-
</p>
<p>ter, did not exceed the sum of fourteen or fifteen

<p>pounds ; 130 whereas it appears that at one time

<p>nine persons paid seven hundred and fifty pounds

<p>sterling, in the city of Dublin alone : and we have

<p>every reason to presume, notwithstanding the si-

<p>the precincts of Dublin. It is a well-known

<p>property of despotism, that its subordinate agents

<p>rapacity of the administration was at least equal-

</p>
<p>* " The Catholics of Ireland, on account of their greater
</p>
<p>number and opulence, had contributed more liberally to the
</p>
<p>above-mentioned, and all other supplies, than all the rest of
</p>
<p>his majesty's subjects of that kingdom; and the king, instead
</p>
<p>of redressing' their present grievances, did, in a few months
</p>
<p>after the date of his letter of thanks above-mentioned, not only
</p>
<p>continue, but increase them, by giving particular instructions
</p>
<p>to Oliver St. John, then going over deputy, to put the statute
</p>
<p>of the 2d of Elizabeth, and all other penal statutes, in strict
</p>
<p>execution ; instructions which Sir Oliver seemed very well
</p>
<p>inclined to pursue ; for, at his entering on the government, he
</p>
<p>did indeed proceed with vigour in the execution of that statute,
</p>
<p>and caused presentments to be made of such as neglected coming
</p>
<p>to church in different parts of the kingdom. The effects of this
</p>
<p>rigour were dismal and extensive ; the treasures of the rich
</p>
<p>were thereby soon exhausted ; and the poor every where, not
</p>
<p>being able to pay this tax on their consciences, fled into dens,
</p>
<p>and caverns from the cruel collectors of it, whither they were
</p>
<p>sometimes pursued by the furious blood-hounds, set on and
</p>
<p>followed by a sheriff and his posse of disbanded soldiers,
</p>
<p>equally furious and unrelenting. Mr. Rooth, a cotemporary
</p>
<p>writer, informs us, that in the poor county of Cavan alone, not
</p>
<p>less than eight thousand pounds were levied in one year, by
</p>
<p>means of this tax. Ecclesiastical censures, on the same ac-
</p>
<p>count, were severely executed in every part of the kingdom.

<p>Those who lay under them, when found abroad, were con-
</p>
<p>stantly thrown into jails ; and great numbers of merchants and
</p>
<p>artificers, being thus confined at home, and hindered to transact
</p>
<p>business publicly, and in the way of open commerce, were
</p>
<p>suddenly reduced to poverty and distress. Even their dead

<p>INGRATITUDE. 117
</p>
<p>In these proceedings of the deputies, under
</p>
<p>the express direction of James I. there was a
</p>
<p>signal display of the base ingratitude that pecu-
</p>
<p>liarly characterized the wretched Stuart race,
</p>
<p>who, during the whole of their sway, were a
</p>
<p>curse and a scourge to Ireland. A short time
</p>
<p>previously, the Irish Parliament had unanimously
</p>
<p>voted that monarch uncommonly liberal supplies,
</p>
<p>for which he had, in his usual verbose style, or-
</p>
<p>dered the deputy to return them his thanks. The
</p>
<p>Catholics were, as justly stated by Curry in the
</p>
<p>preceding note, as much more wealthy as they
</p>
<p>were more numerous than the Protestants ; and
</p>
<p>of course were entitled, for their liberality, to
</p>
<p>some display of gratitude and lenity. But the
</p>
<p>only return made by the miserable king, was to
</p>
<p>issue orders, as we have seen, to the deputy, to
</p>
<p>enforce the execution of the unjust and wicked
</p>
<p>statutes against them.
</p>
<p>Dr. Leland, discussing the oppressions and
</p>
<p>penalties which the Roman Catholics suffered,
</p>
<p>reasons with great sang froid on the folly of their
</p>
<p>subjecting themselves to such disadvantages, and
</p>
<p>appears to believe that there is no more difficulty
</p>
<p>in a change of religion, than in a change of the
</p>
<p>fashion of dress. He very philosophically states.

<p>could be devised and inflicted by their bigoted judges." 131

<p>that "men whose religious principles expose
</p>
<p>them to grievous disadvantages in society, are
</p>
<p>particularly bound to examine those principles
</p>
<p>with care and accuracy, lest they sacrifice the
</p>
<p>interests of themselves and their posterity to an

<p>illusion." 132
</p>
<p>This is a miserable cant, which applies with
</p>
<p>equal force and propriety to the case of all per-
</p>
<p>secutors, of all ages and every country. Diocle-
</p>
<p>sian, Nero, or Mahomet, might with equal pro-
</p>
<p>priety have held the same language to the un-
</p>
<p>happy objects on whom they wreaked their ven-
</p>
<p>geance, as the Irish government. They might
</p>
<p>have said, while they were preparing their stakes

<p>and their flames, " You ought to examine with

<p>care and accuracy those principles which expose
</p>
<p>you to grievous disadvantages, and not to sacri-
</p>
<p>fice your own interests, and those of your pos-
</p>
<p>terity, to an illusion." The idea of a nation laying
</p>
<p>aside, as illusions, those religious opinions which
</p>
<p>they had imbibed in infancy, and those practices
</p>
<p>to which they were habituated through life, and
</p>
<p>which "grew with their growth," would never
</p>
<p>have entered into the mind of any man who was
</p>
<p>not temporarily a dotard ; arrd whatever might
</p>
<p>have been the ordinary range of Dr. Leland's

<p>mind, he must, at that moment have been in

<p>a state of dotage.

</p>
<p>COURT OF WARDS. 119
</p>
<p>POINT III.
</p>
<p>The Court of Wards.
</p>
<p>A very large portion of the exercise of the
</p>
<p>energies, the talents, and the industry of man-
</p>
<p>kind, results from that holy regard to offspring,
</p>
<p>which pervades all animated nature, not except-
</p>
<p>ing the most ferocious tenants of the woods ;
</p>
<p>which is among the most powerful of the impel-
</p>
<p>ling motives of man and beast ; and is wisely
</p>
<p>implanted by ( our Creator for the best purposes.
</p>
<p>Men of genuine parental feelings labour, with at
</p>
<p>least as much zeal, to secure independence and
</p>
<p>happiness for their offspring, as for their own
</p>
<p>proper advantage. But as if nothing holy or
</p>
<p>sacred could escape the violence and virulence
</p>
<p>of the Irish administration, in its dire hostility to
</p>
<p>the Roman Catholics, an attempt was made to
</p>
<p>cut up by the roots this inherent and instinctive
</p>
<p>principle, by the establishment of the court of
</p>
<p>wards, whereby the heirs of the Irish nobility and
</p>
<p>gentry were, on the decease of their parents,
</p>
<p>placed under the care of some court parasite, or
</p>
<p>person who bribed the court, and thus purchas-
</p>
<p>ed the guardianship. Lord Orrery remarks,
</p>
<p>that the objections to the court of wards were,
</p>
<p>that " no man would labour for a child, who, ./or
</p>
<p>aught he knows, may be sold like cattle in the
</p>
<p>market, eren to those who will give most : for,"
</p>
<p>adds he, " SUCH ABUSES HAVE BEEN TOO OFTEN

</p>
<p>COMMITTED by those who have enjoyed the
</p>
<p>120 VINDICLE HIBERNIC.
</p>
<p>bounties of their king." 133 This statement from
</p>
<p>lord Orrery, of the situation of the children of
</p>
<p>the Roman Catholics, who were " sold in the mar-
</p>
<p>ket" to the highest bidder, deserves the most
</p>
<p>marked attention ; and, coming from the pen of
</p>
<p>a most rancorous enemy, establishes this point
</p>
<p>beyond controversy, and exhibits a species of
</p>
<p>oppression of which probably the world has be-
</p>
<p>held few examples.
</p>
<p>Independent of the education of the heirs, the
</p>
<p>court of wards had a control over their marriage,
</p>
<p>of which they made a most iniquitous use ; and
</p>
<p>frequently degraded and dishonoured them, by
</p>
<p>marriage with persons wholly unsuitable in point
</p>
<p>of character and family.*
</p>
<p>In the Trim Remonstrance, the Roman Catho-
</p>
<p>lics make the most severe complaints against the
</p>
<p>exactions, injustice, and oppression of this court,
</p>
<p>* " The wardship and marriage of the heir were likewise
</p>
<p>reserved to the crown. These lands and wardships were
</p>
<p>usually granted to favourites, and men of power and interest,
</p>
<p>who, though they gave security to the court of wards to take
</p>
<p>care, as well of the education and maintenance of the heir, as
</p>
<p>of the good condition of the estate, too often neglected both ;
</p>
<p>destroyed the woods, and committed horrible waste upon the
</p>
<p>lands ; brought up the heir in ignorance, and in a mean manner
</p>
<p>unworthy of his quality; and, SELLING HIS PERSON
</p>
<p>TO THE BEST BIDDER, matched him unequally in point
</p>
<p>of birth and fortune, as well as disagreeably with regard to the
</p>
<p>character, qualities, and figure of the person that was picked
</p>
<p>out to be the companion of his life." 13 *

<p>122 VINDIClJE HIBERNICJE.
</p>
<p>The ostensible object of this iniquitous and
</p>
<p>oppressive court, was to educate the heirs of the
</p>
<p>great Catholic families in the Protestant religion,
</p>
<p>and thus " prevent the growth of Popery " and
</p>
<p>then- efforts to accomplish this grand object,
</p>
<p>reconciled the zealots of that period to the in-
</p>
<p>fraction of all the principles of justice and equity,
</p>
<p>and to the demoralization and ruin of the unhap-
</p>
<p>py objects of their care.
</p>
<p>POINT IV.
</p>
<p>Disabilities.
</p>
<p>The fourth point which I have undertaken to
</p>
<p>prove, is that the Irish Roman Catholics, as such,
</p>
<p>laboured under most severe and grievous restric-
</p>
<p>tions and disqualifications.
</p>
<p>The oath of supremacy is a virtual renuncia-
</p>
<p>ation of the Roman Catholic religion ; as it de-
</p>
<p>clares that the king of England is the supreme
</p>
<p>head of the church. It will not be denied, that
</p>
<p>this is as complete an abjuration as would be the
</p>
<p>oath of a Calvinist, that the Pope was supreme
</p>
<p>head of the Christian church.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, no person could, at that " bless-
</p>
<p>ed" period of " peace and security," when " not a
</p>
<p>single man could say that he had suffered any
</p>
<p>prejudice or disturbance for his religion" without
</p>
<p>taking this oath,

<p>I. Act as magistrate in any corporation :
</p>
<p>DISQUALIFICATIONS. 123
</p>
<p>II. Take any degree of learning in the uni-
</p>
<p>versity;
</p>
<p>HI. Be admitted to plead at the bar in any of
</p>
<p>the courts ;
</p>
<p>IV. Fill any of the great offices of state ;
</p>
<p>V. Sue out livery of his lands, or ouster le
</p>
<p>main out of the hands of the king.*
</p>
<p>These disqualifications, it is true, were not
</p>
<p>always enforced : indeed, in many cases, necessity
</p>
<p>constrained the government to connive at the
</p>
<p>non-enforcement of them. There were various
</p>
<p>parts of the kingdom, where the great mass of
</p>
<p>the people were Roman Catholics, and where
</p>
<p>there were so few Protestants fit for filling offices,
</p>
<p>* " Nobody could be preferred to any degree of learning in
</p>
<p>an university, nor sue livery of his lands, or ouster le main
</p>
<p>out of the hands of the king, or do him homage in order to
</p>
<p>have possession of his estate, without first taking the oath [of
</p>
<p>supremacy.] In consequence thereof, no peer or great man
</p>
<p>who refused it, could be admitted to the dignity of a privy coun-
</p>
<p>sellor, or be advanced to any office of state that might give him
</p>
<p>any share in the government of the kingdom. Nobody could
</p>
<p>legally act as a mayor or magistrate in a corporation, without
</p>
<p>previously qualifying himself for those charges, by the taking
</p>
<p>of this oath." 137
</p>
<p>" The recusant lawyers, a powerful body of men, were an-
</p>
<p>gry that they could not take degrees in larv, be made judges,
</p>
<p>or regularly admitted by any court to plead at the bar, without
</p>
<p>taking the oath of supremacy ; though they probably gained as
</p>
<p>much by their private advice and chamber practice, with less
</p>
<p>trouble to themselves, and less hazard to their reputation, as
</p>
<p>they could have done by the displaying- of their eloquence in
</p>
<p>public." 138

<p>that they were obliged to admit Catholics into
</p>
<p>them. But the disqualifications were constantly
</p>
<p>in existence, constantly held up in terrorem
</p>
<p>over the whole body, frequently enforced with
</p>
<p>rigour, and, in a word, called into operation, or
</p>
<p>suspended, just as suited the purposes of the ru-
</p>
<p>lers and their minions. The cases already stated,
</p>
<p>of lining the aldermen of Dublin, and of seizing
</p>
<p>i; the REVENUES and liberties of the city of Water-
</p>
<p>ford," for the offence of choosing magistrates
</p>
<p>who would not take the oath of supremacy, inde-
</p>
<p>pendent of numberless others to be found in the
</p>
<p>history of Ireland, in almost every page, bear me
</p>
<p>fully out in these propositions ; and prove the
</p>
<p>sacred and delicate regard to truth, and the fide-
</p>
<p>lity and research of lord Clarendon and Dr. War-
</p>
<p>ner, when they state, that " not a single man
</p>
<p>could say that he had suffered any prejudice or
</p>
<p>disturbance on account of his religion."
</p>
<p>Carte, to palliate the injustice and severity of
</p>
<p>the disqualifications of the recusant lawyers, of-
</p>
<p>fers a most extraordinary idea, in mitigation of
</p>
<p>the disadvantages arising from them. He informs
</p>
<p>us, as may be seen in the prefixed note, that they
</p>
<p>"probably [very probably, truly and very wisely
</p>
<p>said] gained as much by their private advice and
</p>
<p>chamber practice" as they could have gained by
</p>
<p>being admitted to the bar ; and (more consola-
</p>
<p>tion !) " with less hazard to their reputation."
</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to point out the absurdity

<p>and futility of these opinions, and how desperate

</p>
<p>must be the cause that is driven to such a defence.
</p>
<p>Suppose a decree were to pass, that all the law-
</p>
<p>yers throughout the United States, who are not
</p>
<p>six feet high, who have dark hair, or grey eyes,
</p>
<p>or aquiline noses, or fair complexions, were to
</p>
<p>be prohibited from pleading in our courts of jus-
</p>
<p>tice (and these criteria, though rather more
</p>
<p>whimsical, would be as just and correct as the
</p>
<p>criterion of religious opinions :) And let us fur-
</p>
<p>ther suppose, that their complaints were met by
</p>
<p>the cogent and convincing answer, that "they
</p>
<p>would probably gain as much by chamber practice
</p>
<p>and private advice," as at the bar, and with " less
</p>
<p>hazard to their reputation." What sentence
</p>
<p>would be pronounced against the man who ora-
</p>
<p>cularly delivered this opinion ? He would be
</p>
<p>regarded, and with justice, either as a confirmed
</p>
<p>knave, or a consummate fool.

<p>shall notice but two : one for their absolute ban-
</p>
<p>ishment ; and the other, in the most unqualified
</p>
<p>and intolerant manner, prohibiting them from the
</p>
<p>public exercise of their functions, throughout the
</p>
<p>whole kingdom. The first was issued by lord
</p>
<p>Chichester, in the commencement of the reign of
</p>
<p>James I. ; and the second by lord Faulkland, early
</p>
<p>in the reign of his successor.
</p>
<p>James, shortly after his accession, banished the
</p>
<p>Roman Catholic priests from Great Britain ; and
</p>
<p>" by a like proclamation were the Popish clergy
</p>
<p>of Ireland commanded to depart within a limited
</p>
<p>time, unless they consented to conform to the laws
</p>
<p>of the land:' 139
</p>
<p>" Unless they consented to conform to the
</p>
<p>laws of the land !" Here more is meant than
</p>
<p>meets the ear. Leland was too courtly to state
</p>
<p>that they were to " depart" unless they abjured
</p>
<p>their religion. But this, disguise it as we may.
</p>
<p>was the real fact.

</p>
<p>POINTS VI. $ VII.
</p>
<p>To establish these two points, it will be suffi-
</p>
<p>cient to state one strong circumstance of sacri-
</p>
<p>legious violence, which would have disgraced a
</p>
<p>band of Algerines or Ostrogoths ; and which,
</p>
<p>unaided by the preceding details, would settle this
</p>
<p>question for ever.
</p>
<p>A congregation of Roman Catholics were as-
</p>
<p>sembled in a chapel in Dublin, to adore the Liv-
</p>
<p>ing God, and to commemorate the death of that
</p>
<p>Jesus Christ whom the government worshipped.
</p>
<p>This daring act, of a people who " enjoyed the
</p>
<p>undisturbed exercise of their religion" and of
</p>
<p>whom " no man could say he had suffered pre-
</p>
<p>judice or disturbance on account of his religion"
</p>
<p>excited as much indignation among the Privy
</p>
<p>Council, as if they had been engaged in some
</p>
<p>most abominable plot. The justices accordingly
</p>
<p>despatched to the chapel a host of sacrilegious
</p>
<p>ruffians, of whom, to their eternal dishonour, the
</p>
<p>leaders were the archbishop, the mayor, and re-

<p>The insulted congregation, as soon as their

<p>amazement and terror at this lawless outrage
</p>
<p>had subsided, attempted to defend their altar,

<p>their priest, and their worship : but, as might be

<p>expected, they were defeated by the soldiery,

<p>and many of them committed to prison, with the

</p>
<p>apprehend them ; which they did, taking aivay the crucifixes
</p>
<p>and paraments of the altar ; the soldiers hewing down the
</p>
<p>image of St. Francis; the priests and friars were delivered into
</p>
<p>the hands of the pursuivants, at whom the people threw stones
</p>
<p>and rescued them ; the lords justices being informed of this,
</p>
<p>sent a guard and delivered them, and clapped eight Popish al-
</p>
<p>dermen by the heels, for not assistmg their mayor. On -this

<p>account, Jlfteen houses, by direction of the lords of the coun-
</p>

<p>factors, and to throw the whole censure on the
</p>
<p>wretched and oppressed people, whose sole crime

<p>w r as worshipping the Living God according to the
</p>
<p>dictates of their consciences.
</p>
<p>It is impossible to read, without indignation,
</p>
<p>the manner in which this flagitious proceeding is
</p>
<p>noticed by Carte and Leland. The former states,
</p>
<p>that the recusants " took greater liberties, in con-
</p>
<p>tempt of the law" than the state could " indulge
</p>
<p>them in" or they practise with prudence. They
</p>
<p>were not satisfied with " the enjoyment of their
</p>
<p>religion in a private way " they " must do it in
</p>
<p>a public manner" 1 " and " when the magistrates
</p>
<p>attempted to apprehend the priest, he was res-
</p>
<p>cued, with horrid affronts to the archbishop and
</p>
<p>mayor, under the -very nose of the government."
</p>
<p>It is a lasting disgrace to " the nose of the go-
</p>
<p>vernment," that it did not smell out the real ma-
</p>
<p>lefactors, and punish them, instead of despatching
</p>
<p>them on so foul an errand.
</p>
<p>It is difficult to conceive of a stronger instance
</p>
<p>of historical chicane than is here displayed ; and
</p>
<p>it is a fair specimen of the manner in which Irish
</p>
<p>history is generally written. The enormities
</p>
<p>perpetrated on the Irish are softened down or
</p>
<p>palliated, and many of them wholly omitted ;
</p>
<p>while the magnifying powers of the microscope,

</p>
<p>Had the Roman Catholics been engaged in some
</p>
<p>dangerous conspiracy to subvert the government;
</p>
<p>in the act of enlisting soldiers for that purpose ;
</p>
<p>or had they in preparation some " infernal ma-
</p>
<p>chine" to blow up the castle, it might be said, that
</p>
<p>" they took greater liberties than the state could
</p>
<p>indulge them in." But to use such language, to
</p>
<p>mark with reprobation the mere act of assem-
</p>
<p>bling peaceably to worship God in the manner
</p>
<p>practised in their country, and throughout the
</p>
<p>whole of Christendom, for ages, displays, quoad

<p>hoc, a most disgraceful iUiberality : and to feign
</p>
<p>such strong sensibilities for the " horrid affront"
</p>
<p>put upon a mitred ruffian? who was resisted in

<p>a sacrilegious attack upon the altars of the Living

<p>independent court of literature, would be suffi-
</p>
<p>cient to have the writer expelled from the ho-
</p>
<p>nourable corps of historians.
</p>
<p>Leland informs us, that " the incident" (that is,
</p>
<p>the attack on the priest, the altar, and the con-
</p>
<p>gregation, and the resistance on the part of the

<p>Catholics) was represented in England in the

</p>
<p>Such is the miserable manner in which the

<p>is written. An outrage which imperiously re-

<p>quired the most glowing language of abhorrence

<p>and reprobation, that could flow from the pen of
</p>
<p>a Tacitus, a Juvenal, or a Junius, is not merely
</p>
<p>glossed over as pardonable, but apparently com-
</p>
<p>mended as meritorious : and those in whose per-

<p>sons the most sacred rights are violated, and who
</p>
<p>are rapaciously despoiled of their altars and their

<p>temples, are held up to reprobation as criminals:

<p>and this by writers who enjoy no small degree of

<p>reputation ; how well deserved, the world will

<p>judge.

<p>Suppose that we admit for a moment, (and the

<p>such odious sacrilege would have been perpetrat-

</p>
<p>The intent of this base procedure is unambigu-

<p>you shall do well to take all fit and safe advantages, By the

</p>
<p>where the seat of the king's chief governor was,
</p>
<p>they went as publicly and as uninterruptedly to
</p>
<p>their devotions, as he went to his." 14 * This false-
</p>
<p>hood is destitute of the slightest defence or exte-
</p>
<p>nuation. It is not on an abstruse, doubtful, or
</p>
<p>contested point, where, even with the best inten-

<p>tions, error is not easily avoided, and where, of

<p>course, error is pardonable. It respects facts of

<p>the utmost notoriety, to bo found by the most cur-

</p>
<p>vice and virtue, are incompatible with each other.
</p>
<p>L'Estrange, whom I quote for this fact, is dis-
</p>
<p>posed to he witty on the subject. He states,
</p>
<p>that " the priests and friars were so persecuted,
</p>
<p>that two of them hanged themselves, in their own
</p>
<p>defence." This is a truly novel mode of self-
</p>
<p>defence. It is, however, far more probable, and
</p>
<p>almost certain, that some bloodthirsty and fanati-
</p>
<p>cal ruffians, inspired by " a holy abhorrence" of
</p>
<p>the " superstitious idolatries and abominations of
</p>
<p>Popery," and availing themselves of the infuriated
</p>
<p>spirit of the government, seized these unfortunate
</p>
<p>men privately, and hanged them up, without
</p>
<p>judge or jury. Of the sanguinary spirit of mobs
</p>
<p>and factions, when merely connived at by the con-
</p>
<p>stituted authorities, and still more when counte-
</p>
<p>nanced and excited by them, the world has had
</p>
<p>many calamitous instances, in ancient and mo-
</p>
<p>dern times ; among which, the Roman proscrip-
</p>
<p>tions, and the Parisian Septembrization, stand
</p>
<p>pre-eminent. But whether those priests died by
</p>
<p>suicide or murder, is of little importance here :
</p>
<p>my object being to prove the existence of the
</p>
<p>persecution of a people, of whom, I beg leave

<p>once more to repeat, lord Clarendon and Warner

<p>DECEPTIONS OF CHARLES I. 139
</p>
<p>Let it be observed, that Borlase in his Reduc-
</p>
<p>tion of Ireland, 149 and Baker in his Chronicles,
</p>
<p>both state the fact to nearly the same effect as
</p>
<p>L'Estrange. Baker informs us, that " most of
</p>
<p>their houses of religion were immediately seized
</p>
<p>into the king's hands ; and such inquisition made
</p>
<p>after the rest, that two priests hanged themselves
</p>
<p>at the apprehension of this (as they called it)
</p>
<p>persecution." 150
</p>
<p>This parenthetical sentence " as they called it,"
</p>
<p>demands attention. It can have but one mean-
</p>
<p>ing, which is, that the writer did not himself be-
</p>
<p>lieve or admit that this was a persecution. It is
</p>
<p>really wonderful, that the idolatrous Papists
</p>
<p>should be so absurd as to call it a persecution.
</p>
<p>Had any such depredation, indeed, been perpe-
</p>
<p>trated on the reformers in England or Scotland,
</p>
<p>it would have truly been a persecution : but
</p>
<p>against idolatrous Papists, it was nothing more
</p>
<p>than a due execution of a necessary law, in-
</p>
<p>tended to put a period to their " idolatry."
</p>
<p>The wickedness of this procedure is so great,
</p>
<p>that it needs no aggravation : and yet it is at-
</p>
<p>tended with circumstances which greatly enhance
</p>
<p>its deformity, and throw the character of the
</p>
<p>" royal martyr " c as Charles I. is absurdly styled,
</p>
<p>into deep shade, and prove him to have been

<p>most deranged state. He was engaged in a war
</p>
<p>with France, deeply in debt, and much distressed
</p>
<p>for resources, which he could not prevail on Par-
</p>
<p>liament to afford. In this emergency, the Irish
</p>
<p>Roman Catholics offered to support constantly
</p>
<p>five thousand foot and five hundred horse, pro-
</p>
<p>vided they were indulged with a mere toleration
</p>
<p>of their religion, and some other favours of minor
</p>
<p>importance.*
</p>
<p>This proposition excited a most awful outcry.
</p>
<p>The archbishop of Armagh, the celebrated Usher,
</p>
<p>and all the other dignified clergy of the establish-
</p>
<p>ed church, with a most miserable spirit of bigot-
</p>
<p>ry and intolerance, worthy of that persecuting
</p>
<p>and fanatical age, but disgraceful to the actors,
</p>
<p>entered a most solemn protestf against the mea-
</p>
<p>* " The toleration they desired was no more than some re-
</p>
<p>spite from the oppressions and extortions of the ecclesiastical
</p>
<p>courts ; and to have all proceedings against them in those
</p>
<p>courts, for religion, suspended; to be released from those
</p>
<p>exorbitant sums which they were obliged to pay for their
</p>
<p>christenings and marriages ; and particularly to have the ex*
</p>
<p>travagant surplice fees of the clergy, and the extraordinary
</p>
<p>warrants for levying them, abolished." 151
</p>
<p>f " The religion of the Papists is superstitious and idola-
</p>
<p>trous ; their faith and doctrine enormous and heretical ; their
</p>
<p>church, in respect to both, apostolical. To give them, there-

<p>sure, as " an abomination and toleration of idola-
</p>
<p>try ; and as being accessary to the perdition of the
</p>
<p>seduced people who perish in the deluge of the
</p>
<p>Catholic apostacy" It is too obvious to need
</p>
<p>enforcement, that if the Catholics enjoyed the
</p>
<p>" undisturbed exercise of their religion" it would
</p>
<p>have been unnecessary to offer so high a price
</p>
<p>for a mere toleration : nor would the attempt to
</p>
<p>procure it have produced such a clamour.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this intolerant opposition, a
</p>
<p>regular compact was entered into, some time
</p>
<p>fore, a toleration, or to consent that they may freely exercise
</p>
<p>their religion, and profess their faith and doctrine, is a griev-
</p>
<p>ous sin, and that in two respects ; for first it is to make our- .
</p>
<p>selves accessary not only to their superstitious idolatries and
</p>
<p>heresies, and in a word to all the abominations of Popery, but
</p>
<p>also (which is a consequent of the former) to the perdition of
</p>
<p>the seduced people which perish in the deluge of the Catholic
</p>
<p>apostacy ; secondly, to grant them a toleration in respect of
</p>
<p>any money to be given, or contribution to be made by them,
</p>
<p>is to set religion to sale, and with it the souls of the people,
</p>
<p>whom Christ hath redeemed with his blood. And as it is a
</p>
<p>great sin, so it is also a matter of most dangerous consequence,
</p>
<p>the consideration whereof we commit to the wise and judici-
</p>
<p>ous, beseeching the God of Truth to make them, who are in

<p>remit the sum of one hundred and fifty thou-

<p>arranged.; and was most shamefully evaded by

<p>DECEPTION OF CHARLES I. 143
</p>
<p>in the usual form, by the British Privy Council.
</p>
<p>Lord Faulkland accordingly summoned a Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment to meet for the purpose of carrying the
</p>
<p>contract into effect : but, by two acts of Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, passed under Henry VIII. and Elizabeth,
</p>
<p>it was ordained that no Parliament should be held
</p>
<p>in Ireland, without " license obtained of his ma-
</p>
<p>jesty, under the great seal of England ;" and with
</p>
<p>this formality Lord Faulkland had not complied,
</p>
<p>very probably, as Leland clearly intimates, 11 by
</p>
<p>collusion between the monarch and his deputy.
</p>
<p>The Privy Council of England, determined not to
</p>
<p>waive any of their privileges, applied to the
</p>
<p>bench of judges for their opinion on the subject,
</p>
<p>who pronounced the summons illegal and void.*
</p>
<p>That this was a collusion on the part of the
</p>
<p>prince, is reduced as near to certainty as in such
</p>
<p>a case is practicable. Had he been sincerely dis-
</p>
<p>posed to perform his engagements, he could in
</p>
<p>one hour have removed the difficulty ; and, as an
</p>
<p>honest man, he ought to have done it. But he
</p>
<p>was so far from this display of honour and
</p>
<p>* Extract from the Opinion of the Judges.
</p>
<p>" We have taken into our consideration the lord deputy's
</p>
<p>commission, wherein he hath power given him to summon the
</p>
<p>Parliament ; but that is limited to be according to the laws,
</p>
<p>statutes, and customs of that kingdom, and with the king's
</p>
<p>consent first had, and not otherwise ; which hath not been ob-
</p>
<p>served in the summons of this intended Parliament, in any of
</p>
<p>the points before-mentioned ; and therefore this summons, not-
</p>
<p>withstanding that power, is illegal and void." 154

<p>integrity, by remedying the error, and calling a
</p>
<p>Parliament immediately, that none was held for
</p>
<p>six years afterwards.
</p>
<p>The laxity of the early writers or compilers of
</p>
<p>history on the subject of dates, renders it difficult
</p>
<p>to fix the chronology of these facts with accuracy.
</p>
<p>It shall be done as far as practicable.
</p>
<p>The commission to the Irish agents who carried
</p>
<p>on the negotiation, is dated August, 1627 ; and
</p>
<p>they arrived in London in September of that year.
</p>
<p>The negotiation probably lasted two months. I
</p>
<p>cannot find the date of lord Faulkland's summons:
</p>
<p>but the Parliament was to have met in November,
</p>
<p>1628. The opinion of the judges is dated, "Ser-
</p>
<p>geant's Inn, October 2, 1628 ;" and the vote of
</p>
<p>the Privy Council against the meeting of the
</p>
<p>Parliament, which does not appear in Rushworth,
</p>
<p>probably issued immediately. But instead of the
</p>
<p>promised, the dearly-purchased graces, lord
</p>
<p>Faulkland, early in the following year, issued the
</p>
<p>most outrageous proclamation, commanding all
</p>
<p>the priests, monks, and friars to disperse them-
</p>
<p>selves, and to give up their convents, colleges,
</p>
<p>monasteries, and other places where they colle-
</p>
<p>giately or conventually assembled ; of which the
</p>
<p>substance may be seen in page 126.

</p>

<p>That this whole affair is as complete an exem-

<p>have other than a very vague idea of the horrible

<p>added this, to have Fitzharris lose one ear in England; an-
</p>
<p>other in Ireland; and if he have a third ear, to lose it in
</p>
<p>Scotland." 151

<p>The case which afforded this wonderful display

</p>
<p>would be for a private person, who had sold a
</p>
<p>house, or a piece of land, and received the price,
</p>
<p>to refuse to make the deed, or convey the pro-
</p>
<p>perty. And how does Leland record this shame-
</p>
<p>ful fact? Why he smoothly informs us, that
</p>
<p>"the king's sincerity appeared at least suspici-
</p>
<p>ozw." m And further : " The king stood engaged,
</p>
<p>that his graces should be confirmed by a law of
</p>
<p>Parliament : and the insincerity of his professions
</p>
<p>was not yet completely discovered." 1 * 3 Had such
</p>
<p>a transaction taken place on the part of the Irish,
</p>
<p>all the powers of language would have been
</p>
<p>exhausted to brand them with infamy.
</p>
<p>The duplicity of Charles was made manifest,
</p>
<p>a few years subsequent to this period ; and stands
</p>
<p>recorded in his own hand-writing. The admi-
</p>
<p>nistration of Ireland was, anno 1633, confided to
</p>
<p>lord Strafford, who was induced, by the embar-
</p>
<p>rassment of the king's affairs, to call a Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, for the purpose of raising a revenue for his
</p>
<p>master. There was a considerable difficulty in
</p>
<p>the way, to evade the sacred pledge given by
</p>
<p>Charles, and to keep the Irish in temper, without
</p>
<p>performance of the contract. Strafford, bold,
</p>
<p>daring, and unprincipled, took upon himself the
</p>
<p>odium of the non-compliance, asserting publicly
</p>
<p>to Parliament, that he had not communicated
</p>
<p>their demands to Charles ; although his own

<p>enraptured to be screened from the perform-

<p>ance of his engagement, and to find his satrap
</p>
<p>assume the odium of the perfidy, of which his

<p>Perfidious as was this conduct, I do not pre-

<p>to the wishes of the judges and the government,

<p>On the two first points, the characteristic infi-

</p>
<p>make the earl [of Cork] and all Ireland know, so long as he
</p>
<p>had the government there, any act of state, there made or to
</p>
<p>be made, should be as binding to the subjects of that kingdom,
</p>
<p>as an act of Parliament ," 156
</p>
<p>" As for the words, he confessed them to be true ; and
</p>
<p>thought he said no more than what became him ; considering
</p>
<p>how much his master's honour was concerned in him; and
</p>
<p>that if a proportionable obedience was not as -well due to acts
</p>
<p>of state, as to acts of Parliament, in vain did councils sit ; and
</p>
<p>that he had done no more than what former deputies had
</p>
<p>done." 157
</p>
<p>" He proved by the lord Dillon, in the lord Chichester's and
</p>
<p>lord Grandison's time, that the acts of state were by the
</p>
<p>judges reputed as laws of the land for the present, and pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded by arrest, imprisonment, and fines, upon contempt,
</p>
<p>which Sir Adam Loftus confirmed." 158

<p>but for the trial of lord Strafford, which threw a
</p>
<p>glare of light on these, as well as many other of
</p>
<p>the heavy grievances of the country, that were
</p>
<p>by the historians passed in silence, or glossed
</p>
<p>over with frothy extenuations and mitigations.
</p>
<p>Lord Strafford, during the whole of his admi-
</p>
<p>nistration, proceeded on the iniquitous principle,
</p>
<p>t; that Ireland was a conquered country, and that
</p>
<p>the king was the lawgiver, in all matters not de-
</p>
<p>termined by acts of Parliament."* This princi-
</p>
<p>ple he openly avowed on his trial, when his life
</p>
<p>was in jeopardy, for this and other causes : and
</p>
<p>this fully accounts for the despotic authority he
</p>
<p>assumed, for his outrageous proceedings with
</p>
<p>Parliament, for his attempted depredation on
</p>
<p>the province of Connaught, which shall be de-
</p>
<p>tailed in a future chapter; and for all the end-
</p>
<p>less variety of injustice and oppression, which
</p>
<p>marked his despotic career, as lord deputy of
</p>
<p>Ireland.
</p>
<p>One awful feature of his administration, which
</p>
<p>he likewise admitted on his trial, and for which
</p>
<p>* Article 3, of the Impeachment,
</p>
<p>" He did declare and publish, that Ireland was a conquef-
</p>
<p>ed nation ; and that the king might do with t'hem what he
</p>
<p>pleased."
</p>
<p>" ' True it is,' he said, l Ireland was a conquered nation ;
</p>
<p>which no man can deny: and that the king is the lawgiver, in
</p>
<p>matters not determined by acts of Parliament, he conceived ajl
</p>
<p>loyal subjects would grant.' " 161

<p>he pleaded precedent as a justification, was send-

</p>
<p>* " Article 15. That the said earl did, by his own authority,
</p>
<p>without any warrant or colour of law, tax and impose great
</p>
<p>sums of money upon the towns of Baltimore, Bandonbridge,
</p>
<p>Tallagh, and divers other towns or places, in the said realm
</p>
<p>of Ireland ; and did cause the same to be levied upon the inha-
</p>
<p>bitants of thos-e towns by troops of soldiers, with force and
</p>
<p>arms, in a warlike manner : and, on the ninth of March, in the
</p>
<p>twelfth year of his now majesty's reign, traitorously did give

<p>authority unto Robert Saville, a sergeant-at-arms, and to the
</p>
<p>captains of companies of soldiers in several parts of the realm,
</p>
<p>to lie on the lands and houses of such as would not conform to

<p>his orders, until they should render obedience to his said or-

</p>
<p>land's time, he knew twenty soldiers assessed upon
</p>
<p>one man, for refusing to pay sixteen shillings
</p>
<p>sterling." 164
</p>
<p>This single fact contains an entire volume on
</p>
<p>this subject. What an awful condemnation it
</p>
<p>carries to the authority of lord Clarendon ! How
</p>
<p>does his " blessed state of peace and security"
</p>
<p>vanish into thin air, when brought to the test of
</p>
<p>the talisman of truth ! And let it be observed,
</p>
<p>that this was an illustration, by a single example,
</p>
<p>of the wretched state of the entire nation, experi-
</p>
<p>enced " as well in time of peace as war."
</p>
<p>Lord Strafford, when answering to the article
</p>
<p>of his indictment on the subject of martial law,
</p>
<p>replied, " It has been always in force, and exe-
</p>
<p>cuted in all times in Ireland, and never so
</p>
<p>sparingly as in my time.*
</p>
<p>" I dare appeal to those that know the coun-
</p>
<p>try, whether in former times many men have not
</p>
<p>been committed and executed by the deputies'
</p>
<p>warrants, that were not thieves and rebels, but
</p>
<p>* " The earl answered, that the lord deputies have ever ex-
</p>
<p>ercised martial law y upon the march of the armies, as well in
</p>
<p>time of peace as war." 165
</p>
<p>" The earl of Ely was sworn, and testified that martial law
</p>
<p>was in use in the kingdom of Ireland." 166
</p>
<p>" The deputies and generals of the army have always exe-
</p>
<p>cuted martial law, which is necessary there." 1 ' 7

<p>such as went up and down the country. If they
</p>
<p>could not give a good account of themselves, the
</p>
<p>provost marshal, by direction of the deputies,
</p>
<p>using in such cases to hang them up. I dare say,
</p>
<p>there are hundreds of examples in'this kind." 1
</p>
<p>In support of these allegations, he caused lord
</p>
<p>Dillon to be cited, who affirmed, that " martial
</p>
<p>law had been practised, and men hanged by it, in
</p>
<p>times of peace." 169
</p>
<p>It must be obvious, even to a cursory observer,
</p>
<p>that when individuals had the power of executing
</p>
<p>martial law on persons " who could not give a
</p>
<p>good account of themselves" many men, obnoxi-
</p>
<p>ous to the ruling powers, would, merely on that
</p>
<p>ground, be regarded as persons " who could not
</p>
<p>give a good account of themselves :" and, infer-
</p>
<p>ring from known principles of human nature,
</p>
<p>from the eternal tendency in the possessors of
</p>
<p>uncontrolled power to abuse it, from the ran-
</p>
<p>corous and malignant spirit that existed towards
</p>
<p>the Roman Catholics, and, at least in an equal
</p>
<p>degree, from the impunity their oppressors" expe-
</p>
<p>rienced, it is by no means improbable, that of the
</p>
<p>" hundreds of persons" who were thus hanged, as
</p>
<p>" not able to give a good account of themselves"
</p>
<p>there were many incomparably superior in worth
</p>
<p>and standing to the military executioners, by
</p>
<p>whose sentence they were hurried to their last
</p>
<p>account, with " all their sins and imperfections
</p>
<p>on their heads."

<p>OPPRESSION OF JURIES. 457
</p>
<p>How little value must have been set upon hu-
</p>
<p>man life, how deplorable the waste of the spe-
</p>
<p>cies, what scenes of carnage and desolation
</p>
<p>must have taken place, when, in a time of peace,
</p>
<p>those " who could not give a good account of them-
</p>
<p>selves" were liable to be tried, and were frequent-
</p>
<p>ly tried, by courts martial, and hanged ! Who
</p>
<p>was to decide on the goodness of the account?
</p>
<p>Probably, in most cases, a merciless wretch, who
</p>
<p>united in his person the three characters of judge,
</p>
<p>jury, and executioner ! What a millenium ! What
</p>
<p>a " blessed condition of peace and security !"
</p>
<p>The imprisonment of juries whose verdicts
</p>
<p>displeased the courts or the deputies, was another
</p>
<p>grievous oppression, and an instrument whereby
</p>
<p>the streams of justice were wholly perverted or
</p>
<p>poisoned. It is obvious that the fear of tedious
</p>
<p>imprisonment and of ruinous fines, must have a
</p>
<p>pernicious effect on juries, and frequently influ-
</p>
<p>ence them to give unjust verdicts, in order to
</p>
<p>rescue themselves from danger. No man's life,
</p>
<p>character, or estate can be secure, if subject to
</p>
<p>the decision of a jury, when fines and imprison-
</p>
<p>ment dance before their mind's eye, as a reward
</p>
<p>for incurring the displeasure of the judges or the
</p>
<p>administration.
</p>
<p>We have the evidence of lord Strafford him-
</p>
<p>self, strong and decisive, on the subject of the
</p>
<p>imprisonment of jurors, in the outrageous case
</p>
<p>of the grand jury of Galway, who were fined

<p>their fines were paid, for a verdict, the circum-
</p>
<p>stances of which require a particular discussion.
</p>
<p>This single case, as a fair specimen of the des-
</p>
<p>potic power exercised over juries generally,
</p>
<p>would be sufficient to explode lord Clarendon's
</p>
<p>picture of the forty years 1 golden age, so far as
</p>
<p>respects personal security.
</p>
<p>But fines and imprisonment were not the only
</p>
<p>bars to a belief in lord Clarendon's " blessed state
</p>
<p>of peace and security." The train was brought
</p>
<p>up by the pillory and mutilation of members ?

<p>and the High Commission Courts.

<p>letters, found in her drawers after her death.

<p>tion, brought the affair before the Privy Coun-

<p>cil, which issued a decree in his favour. The
</p>
<p>chancellor, relying on its illegality, refused com-

<p>pliance ; and, in punishment of his contumacy,
</p>
<p>was sequestered from his seat in the Privy Coun-

<p>despotic monarch, determined to support his des-
</p>
<p>potic vicegerent, rejected the petition : and the
</p>
<p>chancellor was reduced to the humiliating neces-
</p>
<p>sity of deprecating the vengeance of the insolent
</p>
<p>satrap, by an acknowledgment of offence, and a
</p>
<p>request of pardon, 172 for injuries which, we might
</p>
<p>almost venture to assert, deserved the untimely
</p>
<p>end which awaited Strafford, from the vengeance
</p>
<p>of his enemies in the Long Parliament. Certain
</p>
<p>it is, that many men have lost their lives, for acts
</p>
<p>of violence inferior in atrocity to those of which

<p>The other case was that of lord Mountnorris.

<p>The story is related somewhat differently by dif-
</p>
<p>ferent writers ; but I shall adhere to the statement
</p>
<p>given by that lord himself, on the trial of the
</p>
<p>impeachment of lord Strafford.
</p>
<p>Lord Mountnorris had been threatened with a
</p>
<p>stick by the deputy, at a review ; and some time
</p>
<p>afterwards, a relation and namesake of his, who
</p>
<p>lived with lord Strafford, having accidentally hurt
</p>
<p>his foot, while he was labouring under a fit of
</p>
<p>the gout, the circumstance was mentioned in the
</p>
<p>hearing of lord Mountnorris ; and it was said,
</p>
<p>that perhaps he did it to avenge the insult his

<p>kinsman had received. Mountnorris replied, that

<p>a mode of avenging his cause. These expres-

<p>sions, after a considerable lapse of time, were
</p>
<p>reported to lord Strafford, who, with a degree of
</p>
<p>malignity that has probably never been exceeded,
</p>
<p>tortured it into an attempt to excite mutiny, and

<p>had him tried by a court martial. The proceed-

<p>power, &c. and first read the sentence, reciting the king's letter,

<p>commanding a council of war to sit upon the lord Mountnorris,
</p>
<p>a captain, &c. for inciting revenge against the lord deputy,

<p>That being told that a kinsman of his had hurt the lord depu-

<p>of that public affront that the lord deputy did me formerly ;

<p>but I have a brother that would not have taken such revenge.
</p>
<p>That he was required instantly to confess or deny the charge ;

<p>that he desired time to answer, but was denied, as also to pro-

<p>be pleased, for Christ Jesus' sake, to take this my humble suit

</p>
<p>twenty thousand pounds lost in estate, unparalleled precedents

<p>for a peer of that realm ; and still pursued in the castle cham-

<p>majesty's impartial justice redeem him not. He hath been a

<p>careful and faithful servant in chief place to your majesty's

<p>human defects, he most humbly craveth pardon, and layeth
</p>
<p>himself at your majesty's feet, to do with him whatsoever

<p>determined not to impair the despotic authority
</p>
<p>of his representative, by interposing the royal
</p>
<p>clemency between him and any of the objects of
</p>
<p>his malice or vengeance.
</p>
<p>A few revolving years presented to the lips of
</p>
<p>the obdurate favourite, and his equally obdurate
</p>
<p>monarch, the bitter chalice of heartless persecu-
</p>
<p>tion, which they had held forth to those of the
</p>
<p>heart-broken mourner. The conduct of Charles,
</p>
<p>on this occasion, is among the clearest proofs
</p>
<p>he ever afforded of an unrelenting disposition.
</p>
<p>Never was there a stronger claim to the exercise
</p>
<p>of clemency ; and never did the lordly insolence
</p>
<p>of an overbearing satrap more fully require a
</p>
<p>humiliating degradation. The most zealous ad-
</p>
<p>vocates of the unfortunate monarch cannot deny
</p>
<p>that this is an indelible blot on his escutcheon.
</p>
<p>When such elevated characters met such a fate,
</p>
<p>we may well conceive how dreadful must have

<p>been the situation of the nation at large, how

<p>grinding the tyranny under which they groaned,
</p>
<p>and how unfounded lord Clarendon's dreams of

</p>
<p>It may be objected, that, as these noblemen
</p>
<p>were not Roman Catholics, their cases do not
</p>
<p>apply. This objection is of no avail. It rather
</p>
<p>strengthens than enfeebles my argument. Tyran-

<p>ny ran riot with far more impunity over the

<p>Roman Catholics than over the Protestants. The

<p>Further review of Clarendon's millenium. Plots
</p>
<p>and conspiracies. Droppers of letters. Whole-

<p>sale spoliations in Ulster. Law, conscience, and
</p>
<p>honour of James I. Sir John Davies. Frontless

</p>
<p>WE have examined the correctness of lord
</p>
<p>Clarendon's fascinating portrait of the Irish mil-
</p>
<p>lenium, that "blessed condition of peace and
</p>
<p>security," which continued "during the whole
</p>
<p>happy reign of king James," and was " increased
</p>
<p>and improved under his late majesty," so far as
</p>
<p>respects the holy, the sacred right of adoring the
</p>
<p>Living God as conscience dictates ; and also as
</p>
<p>respects the security of person. It now comes
</p>
<p>before us on the question of security of the rights
</p>
<p>of property, the universal stimulus to the exer-
</p>
<p>cise of all the talents and endowments bestowed
</p>
<p>upon us by our Creator.
</p>
<p>The noble author informs us, that " whatsoever
</p>
<p>their land, labour, or industry produced, was their
</p>
<p>own, being free from having it taken from them
</p>
<p>by the king, on any pretence whatsoever."
</p>

</p>
<p>it is just as fair and as correct a portrait as the

</p>
<p>religious one which we have reviewed. Claren-
</p>
<p>don's regard to truth ran pari passu in both
</p>
<p>cases. I hope to make it appear, that, during the
</p>
<p>whole period embraced in his millenium, there
</p>
<p>was hardly a man in the kingdom whose property
</p>
<p>was secure. Under the most frivolous pretexts,
</p>
<p>the nobility and gentry were plundered of estates
</p>
<p>which had remained in their families for ages ;
</p>
<p>and such scenes of rapine and depredation were
</p>
<p>exhibited, as never were exceeded in any coun-
</p>
<p>try in the world, in a time of peace.
</p>
<p>These depredations were of two kinds : by the
</p>
<p>government, on a large scale, but confined to
</p>
<p>particular situations ; and by fraudulent and ra-
</p>
<p>pacious individuals, on a smaU scale, but extended
</p>
<p>all over the country.
</p>
<p>To present the subject more clearly and dis-
</p>
<p>tinctly to the reader, I shah 1 consider each
</p>
<p>branch separately ; and, although the govern-
</p>
<p>ment, throughout the reigns of James I. and
</p>
<p>Charles I. maintained an almost unceasing pre-
</p>
<p>datory warfare on individual property, yet in this
</p>
<p>review, I shall confine myself to the three great
</p>
<p>cases :
</p>
<p>I. The lawless spoliation in Ulster, where six
</p>
<p>counties were at once seized by king James ;
</p>
<p>II. The seizure of a large portion of King's
</p>
<p>and Queen's counties, Longford, Leitrim, and
</p>
<p>Westmeath ;
</p>
<p>III. The projected seizure of the entire pro-

</p>
<p>plishment of which was prevented solely by the
</p>
<p>civil wars in Scotland and England.
</p>
<p>I. The Spoliation of Ulster.
</p>
<p>The unceasing rapine perpetrated on the Irish,
</p>
<p>for four hundred years, from the invasion by
</p>
<p>Henry II. till the reign of James I. was spe-
</p>
<p>ciously covered with the mantle of rebellion,
</p>
<p>which was always within reach. The deputies
</p>
<p>of the kings of England, or the deputies of those
</p>
<p>deputies, or even the provost marshals, could, at
</p>
<p>any time, to suit their purposes, excite a rebel-
</p>
<p>lion, or what, in the castle style, was denominated
</p>
<p>a rebellion. Every act of resistance of insult,
</p>
<p>outrage, or aggression, was thus designated in
</p>
<p>proclamations, and afterwards in histories. The
</p>
<p>prescription was simple. It had been administer-
</p>
<p>ed times without number, and never failed of
</p>
<p>success. It was only to make an inroad, or to
</p>
<p>commit some depredation on such of the Irish
</p>
<p>nobility or gentry as might be selected for the
</p>
<p>purpose, the more flagrant the better ; provoke
</p>
<p>them to resistance, as I have already stated ; then
</p>
<p>proclaim them traitors, and let the armies loose
</p>
<p>to destroy them.
</p>
<p>The pedantic James changed the system ; and
</p>
<p>substituted the fraud of the fox for the violence
</p>
<p>of the lion. He accomplished the same end,
</p>
<p>without the expense of raising a soldier, or firing
</p>
<p>a gun ; and acquired, without disbursing a shil-

<p>nearly five in another. Pretended plots and con-
</p>
<p>spiracies were easily fabricated ; they were un-
</p>
<p>expensive ; and succeeded to admiration, so as
</p>
<p>to render unnecessary the apparatus of a rebel-
</p>
<p>lion, which would have obliged the "peace-loving"
</p>
<p>James to open the doors of the temple of Janus,
</p>
<p>to which he had an unconquerable aversion.
</p>
<p>A catch-penny letter was dropped in the castle,
</p>
<p>containing an absurd and contemptible develop-
</p>
<p>ment of a plot, of which the earls of Tyrone and
</p>
<p>Tyrconnel were asserted to be the principal
</p>
<p>agents.* It was pretended to be from a Catholic,
</p>
<p><-
</p>
<p>* The import of the letter was as follows : " That he was
</p>
<p>called into company by some Popish gentlemen, who, after
</p>
<p>administering an oath of secrecy, declared their purpose to
</p>
<p>murder or poison the deputy, to cut off Sir Oliver Lambert,,
</p>
<p>to pick up one by one the rest of the officers of state, to oblige
</p>
<p>the small dispersed garrisons by hunger to submit, or to pen
</p>
<p>them up as sheep to their shambles. That the castle of Dub-
</p>
<p>lin, being neither manned nor victualled, they held as their
</p>
<p>own; that the towns were for them, the country with them,
</p>
<p>the great ones abroad and in the North prepared to answer the
</p>
<p>first alarm ; that the powerful men in the West are assured by
</p>
<p>their agents to be ready as soon as the state is in disorder.
</p>
<p>That the Catholic king had promised, and the Jesuits from
</p>
<p>the Pope had warranted, men and means to second the first
</p>
<p>stirs, and royally to protect all their actions. That as soon as
</p>
<p>the state is dissolved, and the king's sword in their hands,
</p>
<p>they will elect a governor, chancellor and council, despatch
</p>
<p>letters to king James I. trusting to his unwillingness to em-
</p>
<p>bark in such a war, and to his facility to pardon, would grant
</p>
<p>their own conditions of peace and government, with toleration
</p>
<p>of religion : that if the king listen not to their motions, then

<p>whom they had endeavoured to seduce into the

<p>conspiracy, but whose loyalty rendered him in-
</p>
<p>corruptible. The conspirators, it was stated in
</p>
<p>the letter, had determined on poisoning the de-
</p>
<p>puty, cutting off Sir Oliver Lambert, picking up,
</p>
<p>one by one, the rest of the officers, starving the

<p>readily answered ; and he pretended to them to consent to
</p>
<p>further their projects, and that he took the method of this let-
</p>
<p>ter, to give notice of their designs, though he refused to be-
</p>
<p>tray his friends ; in the mean time he would use his best en-
</p>
<p>deavours to hinder any further practices." And he concludes,
</p>
<p>" That if they did not desist, though he reverenced the Mass
</p>
<p>and Catholic religion equal to any of them, yet he would
</p>
<p>make the leaders of that dance know, that he preferred his

<p>country's good, before their busy and ambitious humours." 176
</p>
<p>* " A letter dropt in the Privy Council Chamber, intimated
</p>
<p>a traitorous scheme of rebellion formed by the earls of Tyrone
</p>
<p>and Tyrconnel, and other Irish lords and gentlemen of the

</p>
<p>This trick of fabricating plots, and dropping
</p>
<p>letters to betray them, had been long in use, and
</p>
<p>was continued through the entire century.* It
</p>
<p>* This trick was successfully carried into ope-
</p>
<p>ration, during the administration of the marquis
</p>
<p>of Ormond, after the restoration, and excited
</p>
<p>such an alarm in the public mind, and such a
</p>
<p>terror and abhorrence of the Roman Catholics,
</p>
<p>that they were completely defeated in their at-
</p>
<p>tempts to procure redress of their grievances, or
</p>
<p>restoration of the property of which they had
</p>
<p>been despoiled. For this express purpose it was
</p>
<p>devised.f
</p>
<p>f " The Papists (under his government) were in no appre-
</p>
<p>hensions of extirpatic|| or other violent measures, the dread of
</p>
<p>which had hurried them into the late rebellion. This mode-
</p>
<p>ration of the lord lieutenant was not agreeable to some persons,
</p>
<p>who possibly imagining that he might be driven out of it by
</p>
<p>the danger of assassination, dropped letters in the streets of
</p>
<p>Dublin, intimating a conspiracy formed for murdering his
</p>
<p>grace ; and several pretended to give an account of what they
</p>
<p>had heard or suspected of such a design." 178

<p>" A letter addressed by an unknown person to lord Mount
</p>
<p>Alexander, in the county of Down, warned him of a general
</p>
<p>massacre intended by the Irish, The style was mean and
</p>
<p>vulgar ; nor was the information on that account less plausible.
</p>
<p>It was confident and circumstantial ; and pointed out Sunday,
</p>
<p>the ninth day of December, as the precise time when this bloody
</p>
<p>design was to be executed, without distinction of sex, age, or
</p>
<p>condition. The like intelligence was conveyed to some other

<p>gentlemen of the northern province : and whether these letters

<p>Avere the contrivance of artifice, or the effect of credulity, their

<p>forms an important feature in the history of the
</p>
<p>oppressions of the Irish, as it was a potent and in-
</p>
<p>fallible instrument to crush and destroy them. It
</p>
<p>therefore requires a particular discussion, which
</p>
<p>it is my intention to bestow on it, in a future
</p>
<p>part of this work.
</p>
<p>Let it suffice, so far as respects the present
</p>
<p>question, that means were used to terrify the
</p>
<p>earls, who, in consequence, fled the kingdom.
</p>
<p>In this flight there is something mysterious,
</p>
<p>which, at this distance of time and place, and in
</p>
<p>the wretched state of Irish history, it is impossi-
</p>
<p>ble to develop. The earls might have been guil-
</p>
<p>ty, and have fled through consciousness of their
</p>
<p>crimes : but it is to the last degree unlikely ; for,
</p>
<p>as Leland observes, " It seems extraordinary, that
</p>
<p>the northerns, who were still smarting under the
</p>
<p>chastisement they had received in the late rebel-
</p>
<p>lion, whose consequence and influence were con-
</p>
<p>siderably diminished, and who were very lately
</p>
<p>reconciled to government, should precipitately
</p>
<p>involve themselves in the guilt of a new rebel-
</p>
<p>lion." 180 And it will not be denied, that, if they
</p>
<p>were guilty, there would have been some evi-
</p>
<p>dence to substantiate their guilt, which never was
</p>
<p>produced : for it is hardly within possibility, that
</p>
<p>a plot of so great magnitude as was pretended,

<p>should have existed, without affording such evi-

</p>
<p>proclamation, in which he lavished the most
</p>
<p>scurrilous abuse on the earls, utterly destitute of
</p>
<p>truth. He charged them, among other things,
</p>
<p>with regarding " murder as no fault ', marriage of
</p>
<p>no use, nor any man worthy to be esteemed va-
</p>
<p>liant, that did not glory in rapine or oppres-
</p>
<p>sion." 181 This tirade is as excessively gross and
</p>
<p>unseemly, as it is wholly destitute of truth, and
</p>
<p>is a disgrace to the memory of the royal pedant.
</p>
<p>There never was a period in Ireland, that could
</p>
<p>justify this Billingsgate attack.
</p>
<p>Dr. Leland, assuming that the earls published
</p>
<p>no vindication of themselves, seems disposed to
</p>
<p>infer from thence, that their silence arose from
</p>
<p>the consciousness of their guilt, which made
</p>
<p>them acquiesce in the justice of their fate. But
</p>
<p>there is no satisfactory proof of this silence : for
</p>
<p>the non-appearance of such a vindication, above
</p>
<p>an hundred and thirty years afterwards, in the
</p>
<p>time of Leland, is by no means to be admitted
</p>
<p>as a proof, or even a presumption, that it was
</p>
<p>not published ; and far less will it warrant the
</p>
<p>inference that the doctor is willing to draw from
</p>
<p>it. Rapin states, that they " gave out that the
</p>
<p>outrages committed on the Catholics had induced
</p>
<p>them to leave their country." 183 He does not
</p>
<p>state in what form they "gave out" this defence :

<p>whether orally or in a written vindication. The
</p>
<p>latter, however, is the more probable course.
</p>
<p>But we have no proof that this was the reason
</p>
<p>they "gave out" for their flight : it rests on the
</p>
<p>single declaration of Rapin ; and the various in-
</p>
<p>stances we have seen of the characteristic infide-
</p>
<p>lity and illiberality of the historians of Irish af-
</p>
<p>fairs, in plain and simple points, impose on us
</p>
<p>an imperious duty to receive their accounts with
</p>
<p>great circumspection, in cases involved in diffi-
</p>
<p>culty or uncertainty.
</p>
<p>On this question, the reasoning of Dr. Curry
</p>
<p>is so strong and conclusive, that there needs no
</p>
<p>apology for laying it before the reader :
</p>
<p>" The king himself was so apprehensive that this affair of
</p>
<p>the earls 4 might blemish' (as he expresses it, in a proclama-
</p>
<p>tion on that occasion) ' the reputation of that friendship which
</p>
<p>ought to be mutually observed between him and other princes,
</p>
<p>that he thought it not amiss to publish some such matter, by
</p>
<p>way of proclamation, as might better clear men's judgments
</p>
<p>concerning the same.' At the same time solemnly promising
</p>
<p>* that it should appear to the rvorld as clear as the sun, by
</p>
<p>evident proof, that the only ground of these earls' departure,
</p>
<p>was the private knowledge and inward terror of their own
</p>
<p>guiltiness.' But neither in that proclamation, nor in any other
</p>
<p>authentic instrument, nor in any manner whatever, did his ma-
</p>
<p>jesty deign, ever after, to enlighten the world, even with the
</p>
<p>least glimpse of evident proof, that such was the only motive
</p>
<p>of these earls' departure.' And I shall leave it to the decision
</p>
<p>of every candid reader, whether the non-performance of his
</p>
<p>majesty's solemn promise be not a better negative proof of the
</p>
<p>nullity and fiction of this conspiracy of the earls, than the bare
</p>
<p>non-appearance of a memorial in their vindication can be
</p>
<p>deemed of its reality." 183

</p>
<p>174 VINDICL& HIBERNICJK.
</p>
<p>An account of the discovery of the conspiracy,
</p>
<p>entirely different from the foregoing, has been
</p>
<p>published : for the trick of the letter was found
</p>
<p>to be too gross, and had been worn threadbare.
</p>
<p>It is stated by Carleton, bishop of Chichester, that
</p>
<p>the earl of Tyrone having possessed himself of
</p>
<p>some lands belonging to the bishop of Meath, the
</p>
<p>latter applied to O'Cahan, one of the conspirators,
</p>
<p>for information on the subject of those lands,
</p>
<p>which he promised to furnish. The bishop ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly brought him to Dublin, to give testi-
</p>
<p>mony on the subject. Process was issued against
</p>
<p>the earl, ordering him to appear in that city, to
</p>
<p>answer the bishop of Berry's claim,* but without
</p>
<p>* " Tyrone, understanding the bishop sought to recover the
</p>
<p>lands of the bishopric, told the bishop thus much, ' My lord,
</p>
<p>you have two or three bishoprics, and yet you are not content
</p>
<p>with them : you seek the lands of my earldom.' ' My lord,'
</p>
<p>quoth the bishop, 4 your earldom is swoln so big with the
</p>
<p>lands of the church, that it will burst, if it be not vented.'
</p>
<p>" The bishop, intending in a lawful course to recover the
</p>
<p>lands lost, found that there was no man could give him better
</p>
<p>light and knowledge of th6se things than O'Cane, who had
</p>
<p>been great with Tyrone ; and to make use of him was a matter
</p>
<p>of difficulty : yet some means being used to him, he came of
</p>
<p>his own accord to the bishop, and told him that he could help
</p>
<p>him to the knowledge of that which he sought : but he was
</p>
<p>afraid of Tyrone. * Nay,' said the bishop, ' I will not trust
</p>
<p>you ; for I know that one bottle of aqua vitae will draw you
</p>
<p>from me to Tyrone.'
</p>
<p>" Whereupon he took a book, and laid it on his head, say-
</p>
<p>ing, ' Ter luiro, ter luiroj which, my lord of Meath said, (who
</p>
<p>told me this story) is one of the greatest kind of affirming a
</p>
<p>truth which the Irish have : and after this ceremony perform-

<p>reference to any conspiracy, or dropped letter.
</p>
<p>" There was no other intention then but in a
</p>
<p>peaceable way to bring the suit to a trial :" for,
</p>
<p>let it be well weighed, THE COUNCIL THEN KNEW
</p>
<p>NOTHING OF THE CONSPIRACY. 184
</p>
<p>These accounts are in direct opposition to each
</p>
<p>other, and prove the rottenness of the affair.
</p>
<p>Dr. Carleton's narrative is a wretched, improba-
</p>
<p>ble tale : but if it were true, then the story
</p>
<p>of the dropped letter is obviously a falsehood :
</p>
<p>and if the letter were really dropped, and led to
</p>
<p>the discovery of the conspiracy, then is the
</p>
<p>" O'Cane, using this ceremony, promised to reveal all that
</p>
<p>he knew in that matter, if he would, on the other side, promise
</p>
<p>him to save him from the violence of Tyrone, and not to de-
</p>
<p>liver him into England, which he promised to do.
</p>
<p>" Whereupon the bishop resolved to bring him to the coun-
</p>
<p>cil of Ireland, there to take his confession. Thus they coming
</p>
<p>peaceably to the council, the confession of O'Cane was taken.
</p>
<p>After this, process were sent to Tyrone, to warn him to come,
</p>
<p>at an appointed time, to answer to the suit of the lord bishop of
</p>
<p>Derry. There was no other intention then but in a peaceable
</p>
<p>manner to bring the suit to a trial. But behold the burden of
</p>
<p>an evil conscience ! Tyrone had entered into a new conspiracy,
</p>
<p>to raise another rebellion : of this conspiracy was O'Cane.
</p>
<p>This thing rvas secret : THE COUNCIL KNEW NOTHING OF IT.
</p>
<p>Tyrone, being- served with process to answer the suit, began to
</p>
<p>suspect that this was but a plot to draw him in ; that surely
</p>
<p>all the treason was revealed by O'Cane, whom he knew to be
</p>
<p>of the conspiracy ; that the pretence was a process and a trial
</p>
<p>in law, but THE INTENT WAS TO HAVE HIS HEAD. Upon this
</p>
<p>bare suspicion, Tyrone resolved, with such other as was in the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, to fly ; and thereupon fled out of Ireland, with his
</p>
<p>confederates, and left all those lands in the north of Ireland." 185

<p>bishop's account false. We leave the reader to
</p>
<p>settle the question of fraud between them ; and
</p>
<p>venture to submit what appears a much more
</p>
<p>rational view of the affair than is given by either
</p>
<p>of the statements.
</p>
<p>The greedy courtiers, who finally obtained
</p>
<p>possession of the immense estates of the earls,
</p>
<p>were hungering after them, and anxious to find
</p>
<p>some pretext for a seizure. They had recourse
</p>
<p>to the clumsy contrivance of the letter, the con-
</p>
<p>tents of which were probably magnified and ex-
</p>
<p>aggerated to the most extravagant degree, accom-
</p>
<p>panied with rumours and threats of a rigorous
</p>
<p>course to be pursued with them, if they came to
</p>
<p>Dublin ; at the same time issuing process for
</p>
<p>Tyrone to appear there. Thus he and those
</p>
<p>implicated with him in the dropped-letter-contri-
</p>
<p>vance, were placed in the dilemma, to attend,
</p>
<p>and probably be attainted, or to refuse, and be
</p>
<p>proclaimed rebels and traitors, and pursued with
</p>
<p>fire and sword, as was the usual mode of pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding in such cases. In these trying circum-
</p>
<p>stances, they fled for safety to the continent.
</p>
<p>But so far as respects the present object, the dis-
</p>
<p>proof of Clarendon's millenium, it is of little
</p>
<p>importance what construction the reader puts on
</p>
<p>this statement. It is barely submitted, without
</p>
<p>any concern whether it be admitted or rejected,
</p>
<p>as beyond comparison more probable than the
</p>

<p>and conspiring accomplice, and running volun-
</p>
<p>tarily into danger of his neck and estate, to make
</p>
<p>discoveries of property belonging to, and for the
</p>
<p>benefit of, an entire stranger, and a Protestant !
</p>
<p>The case of an earl of Tyrone, perhaps the
</p>
<p>same person, under queen Elizabeth, affords a
</p>
<p>specimen of the wretched flimsiness of the pre-
</p>
<p>texts made use of to involve the Irish nobility in
</p>
<p>the charge of treasonable conspiracies.
</p>
<p>" The lord deputy and council (says Sir James Ware)
</p>
<p>certified her majesty of the daily seditious practices of the earl,
</p>
<p>which they looked upon to be forerunners of rebellion : how
</p>
<p>he sent to Mac Connel, who was a chief among the Island
</p>
<p>Scots, many of his men, upon condition to receive supplies
</p>
<p>from him upon any occasion whatsoever he required ; how he
</p>
<p>claimed the chief men of Ulster to depend on him as his
</p>
<p>vassals ; how he had sent his son to be fostered among the
</p>
<p>0" Cohans, to whom he had formerly been a great enemy;
</p>
<p>which showed a great combination to make way for his future
</p>
<p>greatness; fostering being accounted the greatest bond of
</p>
<p>amity among the Irish. They concluded with an earnest
</p>
<p>request, that some treasure might be sent over to supply the
</p>
<p>soldiers' wants." 186
</p>
<p>" Though Tyrone had served against Macguire, and re-
</p>
<p>ceived a wound in the service, yet his refusal to deliver the
</p>
<p>sons of Shane O'Neal, after their escape out of the castle of
</p>
<p>Dublin, when required so to do, together with his frequent
</p>
<p>complaints against the lord deputy, the marshals, and the gar-
</p>
<p>rison soldiers, gave sufficient ground to believe that he only
</p>
<p>covered his treacherous intentions, till he might be ready to
</p>
<p>put them in execution." 187 Excellent proofs, most assuredly !
</p>
<p>The case of Shane O'Neal, the chief potentate
</p>
<p>of Ulster, during the same reign, is still more in

<p>point. His conspiracy was not discovered by
</p>
<p>" a dropped letter" but revealed to a servant, at
</p>
<p>a drinking bout. The stoiy is narrated with
</p>
<p>great naivete, by Sir James :
</p>
<p>" At this time, the lord lieutenant received some intimation
</p>
<p>that Shane O'Neal was contriving new conspiracies" 16 *
</p>
<p>How do you suppose, gentle reader, he re-
</p>
<p>ceived this intimation, and what were the con-
</p>
<p>tents of it ? Attend :
</p>
<p>" A kinsman of his, [Shane O'Neal's] drinking in company
</p>
<p>with the collector of the archbishop of Armagh's revenues at
</p>
<p>Drogheda, was heard to swear by his soul, that his cousin -was
</p>
<p>a patient fool, and so were his ancestors, in taking an earldom
</p>
<p>from the kings of England, when, by right, themselves were
</p>
<p>kings. He further added, by way of question, to the bishop's
</p>
<p>servant, Is it not so ? The man was glad to comply, and to say
</p>
<p>it was so, seeing six of the Irish in the room, with their skeans
</p>
<p>by them. But as soon as he came to his master, Adam Loftus,
</p>
<p>he cried out, Pardon me, master. The archbishop asking him,
</p>
<p>Why, what hast thou done ? He told him the whole story.
</p>
<p>Whereupon he -wrote to the lord lieutenant about z." 189
</p>
<p>Certainly this was a most important communi-
</p>
<p>cation to the lord lieutenant, on which the safety
</p>
<p>of the state depended, and precisely on a level
</p>
<p>with the dropped letter, which cost one hundred
</p>
<p>and fifty thousand people five hundred thousand
</p>
<p>acres of land. Never, before or since, has any
</p>
<p>letter, whether dropped or sent through the post-
</p>
<p>office, afforded such a harvest.
</p>
<p>In consequence of this " conspiracy," so very
</p>
<p>dangerous in itself, so miraculously discovered.

<p>and so accurately and minutely detailed, troops
</p>
<p>were raised against the rebel, many of his fol-

<p>most important item in the spoils of war gained

<p>great army of English and. Irish, in order to root out Shane

<p>Here, the reader will observe, there was no

<p>numerous branches and dependencies, to the

<p>affect the character of the proceedings of king
</p>
<p>James, after " their fugacy" as it is quaintly
</p>
<p>termed by Sir Thomas Philips. Those proceed-
</p>
<p>ings displayed such a flagitious spirit of depreda-
</p>
<p>tion, such a total disregard of private right and
</p>
<p>the calls of humanity, such a wanton waste of
</p>
<p>human happiness, and such base hypocrisy, in
</p>
<p>cloaking it with a regard for the civilization and
</p>
<p>the eternal happiness of the natives, as cannot be
</p>
<p>exceeded in the history of human injustice.
</p>
<p>For admitting the guilt of the earls to have
</p>
<p>been fully and completely established, they and
</p>
<p>their accomplices alone ought to have suffered
</p>
<p>for it. It was a violation of every principle of
</p>
<p>honour and justice, to involve the innocent with
</p>
<p>the guilty, to proscribe indiscriminately the en-
</p>
<p>tire population of six out of the thirty-two coun-
</p>
<p>ties contained in the kingdom. This was the
</p>
<p>course pursued in the plantation of Ulster, of
</p>
<p>which such erroneous statements have been
</p>
<p>made, in all the histories that embrace the reign
</p>
<p>of James I. with hardly an exception.
</p>
<p>By the "fugacy" of the earls, every man in
</p>
<p>the six counties was regarded as having at once,
</p>
<p>ipso facto, forfeited his lands, which became

<p>vested in the crown, to be granted, at the plea-
</p>
<p>sure of the monarch, to whomsoever, and on

<p>whatsoever terms, he judged proper.

<p>nificent scheme, which has immortalized the
</p>
<p>memory of the first Stuart that wielded the triple

<p>sceptre of the British dominions ?
</p>
<p>To bring this point home to the feelings of an
</p>
<p>American reader, I venture to state an analogous
</p>
<p>case, to which I request particular attention.
</p>
<p>Suppose that the resistance of America, in 1776,

<p>but in this manner, viz. one third part in fee farm ; another
</p>
<p>third part for forty years or under ; reserving to themselves
</p>
<p>the other third part, without alienation, during the said five
</p>
<p>years. But after the said Jive years, they shall be at liberty
</p>
<p>to alien to all persons EXCEPT THE MERE IRISH, and such
</p>
<p>persons as will not take the oath which the said undertakers
</p>
<p>are to take as aforesaid.' 1195
</p>
<p>Article concerning the servitors.
</p>
<p>" 9. They [the servitors] shall not alien their portions, or
</p>
<p>any part thereof, to the mere Irish, or to any such person or
</p>
<p>persons as will not take the like oath, as the said undertakers
</p>
<p>were to take as aforesaid ; and to that end a proviso shall be
</p>
<p>inserted in their letters patents." 196

<p>to the true state of the case, to make the analogy

<p>more complete, suppose a wild, incoherent letter

<p>of a conspiracy ; suppose that such threats were

</p>
<p>suppose that, in consequence of their flight,

<p>George III. imitating the pious example of

</p>
<p>is quite mistaken : one of the vilest remains to

<p>be stated. The wretched natives, thus plundered,

</p>
<p>were still further plundered, and defrauded of a
</p>
<p>large portion of the shabby " equivalent," as it

<p>whatever, of what was intended for them by the

<p>p
</p>
<p>upright monarch by whom this spoliation had
</p>
<p>been perpetrated.

<p>" The commissioners appointed to distribute the lands,
</p>
<p>scandalously abused their trusts : and, by fraud or violence,
</p>
<p>deprived the natives of those possessions which the king had
</p>
<p>reserved for them. Some indeed were allowed to enjoy a small
</p>
<p>pittance of such reservation. OTHERS WERE TOTALLY EJECT-

<p>u There are not wanting proofs of the most iniquitous prac-
</p>
<p>tices , of hardened cruelty, of vile perjury, and scandalous su~
</p>
<p>bornation, employed to despoil the fair and unoffending pro-
</p>
<p>prietor of his inheritance" 1
</p>
<p>" In several ancient grants, there had been a reservation of
</p>
<p>rents to the crown. During long intervals of commotion, the
</p>
<p>king's revenue had not been, nor could be, regularly collected;
</p>
<p>nor had such rents been put in charge, by his officers, for ages.
</p>
<p>Acquittances were now demanded. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO
</p>
<p>PRODUCE THEM : and the failure to produce them was pleaded
</p>
<p>as SUFFICIENT TO OVERTHROW THE FAIREST TITLES." 202
</p>
<p>After a careful perusal of the foregoing view
</p>
<p>of the indefensible means by which James pos-
</p>
<p>sessed himself of so fair a portion of Ireland, and
</p>
<p>the wanton injustice whereby the settlement was
</p>
<p>regulated, what must be the astonishment, how
</p>
<p>great the indignation, of tke candid and upright,
</p>
<p>to read the deceptious and encomiastic manner
</p>
<p>in which the affair is blazoned forth by all the
</p>
<p>historians who have treated on it ! Had James
</p>
<p>civilized a nation of fierce barbarians, without
</p>
<p>offering the least violence to their persons, the
</p>
<p>least injustice to their property, had he framed
</p>
<p>for them a code of laws equal to what might be
</p>
<p>produced by the united wisdom of Moses, Lycur-
</p>
<p>gus, Solon, Minos, Numa Pompilius, and Alfred,
</p>
<p>had he settled them on lands of his own, and
</p>
<p>bestowed abundant means of cultivating them,
</p>
<p>he could not be entitled to higher encomiums

<p>than are lavished on acts which, so far as the

</p>
<p>severest strains of indignant reprobation.*
</p>
<p>" To consider James in a more advantageous light," says
</p>
<p>Hume, " we must take a view of him as the legislator of Ire-
</p>
<p>land: and most of the institutions which he had formed for
</p>
<p>civilizing that kingdom, being finished about this period, it
</p>
<p>may not here be improper to give some account of them. He
</p>
<p>frequently boasts of the management of Ireland as his master-
</p>
<p>piece ; and it will appear, upon inquiry, that his vanity in this
</p>
<p>particular was not altogether unfounded*
</p>
<p>" After abolishing these Irish customs, and substituting
</p>
<p>English law in their place, James, having taken all the natives
</p>
<p>under his protection, and declared them free citizens, proceed-
</p>
<p>ed to govern them by a regular administration, military as
</p>
<p>well as civil." 204
</p>
<p>Here is a portrait, as like the real state of
</p>
<p>the case, as the reign of Nero was like that of
</p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius. After having despoiled an

<p>clearly and indisputably, lay at the mercy of the crown, and
</p>
<p>had no way but to compound on the best terms he could obtain^
</p>
<p>and to get a new grant of his estate." 205
</p>
<p>" Where no grant appeared, or no descent or conveyance in
</p>
<p>pursuance of it could be proved, the land -was immediately ad-
</p>
<p>judged to belong to the crown" 3 **
</p>
<p>" The lands of all absentees, and of all that had been expell-
</p>
<p>ed by the Irish, were, by various acts, again vested in the
</p>
<p>crown, which impeached almost every grant of land antecedent
</p>
<p>to that period. Nor did later grants afford a full security. If
</p>
<p>any former grant subsisted at the time when they were made ;
</p>
<p>if the patents passed in Ireland were not exactly agreeable to

</p>
<p>" James," says Leland, " who affected to derive his glory
</p>
<p>from the arts of peace, resolved to dispose of those lands in
</p>
<p>such manner as might introduce all the happy consequences of
</p>
<p>peace and cultivation. The experience of ages bears the most
</p>
<p>honourable testimony to the design : and Ireland must acknow-
</p>
<p>ledge, that here were the first foundations laid of its affluence
</p>
<p>and security." 208
</p>
<p>" Such was the general scheme of this famous northern plan-
</p>
<p>tation, so honourable to the king, and of such consequence to
</p>
<p>the kingdom of Ireland." 809
</p>
<p>" The passion for plantation, which James indulged, -was
</p>
<p>actuated by the fairest and most captivating motives. He con-
</p>
<p>sidered himself as the destined reformer and civilizer of a
</p>
<p>rude people ; and was impatient of the glory of teaching a
</p>
<p>whole nation the valuable arts of life ; of improving their
</p>
<p>lands, extending their commerce, and refining their man-
</p>
<p>ners." 210
</p>
<p>The cravings of the passion for spoliation and
</p>
<p>plantation, with which James was devoured, when
</p>
<p>he had exhausted all the pretences of conspiracy,
</p>
<p>were by no means lulled to rest. He broke new
</p>
<p>ground ; and availed himself of claims arising
</p>
<p>from the conquest of Henry II. and of concessions
</p>
<p>made by that monarch, to despoil those whose
</p>
<p>ancestors had been in undisturbed possession for
</p>
<p>centuries. To this system of rapine the polished
</p>
<p>Leland devotes eleven lines, without one decisive
</p>
<p>word of censure or disapprobation. It is true>
</p>
<p>he hints that all is not exactly as it should be.

<p>" In the pursuit of this favourite object, he had sometimes
</p>
<p>recourse to claims, which the old natives deemed unjust.
</p>
<p>The seizure of those lands, whose possessors had medi-
</p>
<p>tated rebellion, and fled from the sentence of the law, produced
</p>
<p>little clamour or murmuring. But when he recurred to
</p>
<p>the concessions made by Henry II. to invalidate TITLES
</p>
<p>DERIVED FROM A POSSESSION OF SOME CEN-
</p>
<p>TURIES, the apparent severity had its full effect on those
</p>
<p>who were not acquainted with the refinements of law, and not
</p>
<p>prepossessed in favour of such refinements, when employed to
</p>
<p>divest them of their ancient property." 811
</p>
<p>To this sentence, the reader's attention is spe-
</p>
<p>cially invited. When Leland informs us, that
</p>
<p>the natives deemed the king's claims unjust, it is
</p>
<p>fair to infer, that he himself believed them just,
</p>
<p>or at least that there was reason to doubt on the
</p>
<p>subject. But what was the nature of those claims ?
</p>
<p>They are stated by Leland himself, at the close
</p>
<p>of the sentence. They were grounded on con-
</p>
<p>cessions four hundred years old. Yet of those
</p>
<p>claims, which, if universally admitted, would for-
</p>
<p>feit nearly the whole globe, this candid and im-
</p>
<p>partial writer simply informs his abused reader,
</p>
<p>that "the old natives" [were so unreasonable, that
</p>
<p>they] " deemed them unjust" The interpolated
</p>
<p>parenthesis in this sentence is, I think, by no
</p>
<p>means forced or strained. It is the natural form
</p>
<p>in which the phraseology presents itself to the
</p>
<p>mind's eye.

<p>moval (which was done in the public Sessions-House, the lord

</p>

<p>estates of inheritance in their possessions, which their chief

<p>lords could not forfeit ; and therefore, in their name, desired
</p>
<p>two things : first, that they might be admitted to traverse the

<p>offices which had been found of those lands ; secondly, that
</p>
<p>they might have the benefit of a proclamation made about five
</p>
<p>years since, whereby the persons, lands, and goods, of all his
</p>
<p>majesty's subjects, were taken into his royal protection.
</p>
<p>" To this the king's attorney, being commanded by the

<p>lord deputy, made answer : That he was glad that this occa-
</p>
<p>sion was offered, of declaring and setting forth his majesty's

<p>SUCH KINGDOMS) as for the satisfaction of the natives them-
</p>
<p>selves, and of all the world; for his majesty's right, it shall
</p>
<p>appear, said he, that his majesty may and ought to dispose of

</p>
<p>chief lords elected by the country have been lately slain in
</p>
<p>rebellion, (which is an attainder in law) these lands are holden
</p>
<p>immediately of his majesty.
</p>
<p>" If then the king's majesty be immediate chief lord of
</p>
<p>these lands, let us see what estates the tenants or possessors
</p>
<p>have, by the rules of the common law of England.
</p>
<p>" Either they have an estate of inheritance or a lesser
</p>
<p>estate : a lesser estate they do not claim ; or if they did, they
</p>
<p>ought to show the creation thereof, which they cannot do.
</p>
<p>" If they have an estate of inheritance, their lands ought to
</p>
<p>descend to a certain heir ; but neither their chiefries nor their
</p>
<p>tenancies ever descend to a certain heir ; therefore they have
</p>
<p>no estate of inheritance.
</p>
<p>. " Their chiefries were ever carried in a course of tannistry,
</p>
<p>to the eldest and strongest of the sept, who held the same
</p>
<p>during life, if he were not ejected by a stronger.
</p>
<p>" This estate of the chieftain or tannist hath been lately ad-
</p>
<p>judged no estate in law, but only a transitory and scambling
</p>
<p>possession.
</p>
<p>" Their inferior tenancies did run in another course, like the
</p>
<p>old gavelkind in Wales, where the bastards had their por-
</p>
<p>tions, as well as the legitimate ; which portion they held not
</p>
<p>in perpetuity, but the chief of the sept did once in two or
</p>
<p>three years shuffle and change their possessions, by new par-
</p>
<p>titions and divisions ; which made their estates so uncertain,
</p>
<p>as that, by opinion of all the judges in this kingdom, this pre-
</p>
<p>tended custom of gavelkind is adjudged and declared void
</p>
<p>in law.
</p>
<p>"And as these men had no certain estates of inheritance,
</p>
<p>so did they never till now claim any such estate, nor conceive

</p>
<p>that their lawful heirs should inherit the land which they pos-
</p>
<p>sessed ; which is manifest by two arguments.
</p>
<p>" 1. They never esteemed lawful matrimony, to the end that
</p>
<p>they might have lawful heirs.

</p>
<p>sought to convince them, that "his majesty
</p>
<p>was the most just prince living, and would not
</p>
<p>" 2. They never did build any houses, nor plant orchards or
</p>
<p>gardens, nor take any care of their posterities.
</p>
<p>" If these men had no estates in law, either in their mean
</p>
<p>chiefries or in their inferior tenancies, it followeth, that if fas
</p>
<p>majesty, who is the undoubted lord paramount, do seize and.
</p>
<p>dispose these lands, they can make no title against his majesty
</p>
<p>or his patentees, and consequently cannot be admitted to tra-
</p>
<p>verse any office of those lands ; for without shewing a title,
</p>
<p>no men can be admitted to traverse an office.
</p>
<p>" Thus then it appears, that as -well by the Irish custom as
</p>
<p>the law of England, his majesty may, at his pleasure, seize
</p>
<p>those lands, and dispose thereof. The only scruple which
</p>
<p>remains, consists in this point : whether the king may, in con-
</p>
<p>science or honour remove the ancient tenants, and bring ia
</p>
<p>strangers among them.
</p>
<p>" Truly his majesty may not only take this course lawfully,
</p>
<p>but is bound in conscience so to do.
</p>
<p>" For, being the undoubted rightful king of this realm, so
</p>
<p>as the people and land are committed by the Divine Majesty
</p>
<p>to his charge and government, his majesty is bound in con-
</p>
<p>science to use all lawful and just courses to reduce his people
</p>
<p>from barbarism to civility : the neglect whereof heretofore
</p>
<p>hath been laid as an imputation upon the crown of England.
</p>
<p>Now civility cannot possibly be planted among them" [without
</p>
<p>plundering them of their estates] " but by this mixed plantation
</p>
<p>of civil men, which likewise could not be without removal and
</p>
<p>transplantation of some of the natives, and settling their pos-
</p>
<p>sessions in a course of common law ; for if themselves were
</p>
<p>suffered to. possess the whole country, as their septs have done
</p>
<p>for many hundreds of years past, they would never, to the
</p>
<p>end of the world, build houses, make townships or villages, or
</p>
<p>manure or improve the land as it ought to be; therefore it stands

</p>
<p>to gain many such kingdoms." This was a very
</p>
<p>and] " dispose it to such persons as will make a civil planta-
</p>
<p>tion thereupon.
</p>
<p>" Again, his majesty may take this course IN CON-
</p>
<p>SCIENCE ; because it tendeth to the good of the inhabitants
</p>
<p>many ways ; for half their lands doth now lie waste ; by rea-
</p>
<p>son whereof that which is inhabited is not improved to half
</p>
<p>the value : but when the undertakers are planted among them,
</p>
<p>(there being place and scope enough both for. them and for the
</p>
<p>natives,)" [yet a large portion of them were transported to the
</p>
<p>wild wastes in Connaught and Munster,] " and that all the
</p>
<p>land shall be fully stocked and manured, Jive hundred acres
</p>
<p>will be of better value than Jive thousand are now. Besides,
</p>
<p>where before their estates were altogether uncertain and tran-
</p>
<p>sitory, so as their heirs did never inherit, they shall now have
</p>
<p>certain estates of inheritance, the portion allotted unto them,
</p>
<p>which they and their children after them, shall enjoy with
</p>
<p>security.
</p>
<p>" Lastly, this transplantation of the natives is made by his
</p>
<p>majesty, rather like a father than like a lord or monarch. The.
</p>
<p>Romans transplanted whole nations out of Germany into
</p>
<p>France ; the Spaniards lately removed all the Moors out of
</p>
<p>Grenada into Barbary, without providing them any new seats
</p>
<p>there : -when the English Pale was first planted, all the natives
</p>
<p>were clearly expelled, so as not one Irish family had so much-
</p>
<p>as an acre of freehold, in all the Jive counties of the Pale: and
</p>
<p>now, within these four years past, the Graemes were removed
</p>
<p>from the borders of Scotland to this kingdom, and had not one
</p>
<p>foot of land allotted to them here : but these natives of Cavan
</p>
<p>have competent portions of land assigned to them, many of

<p>them in the same barony where they dwelt before ; and such

<p>as are removed are planted in the same county, so as his ma-

<p>handsome and suitable exordium to a discourse
</p>
<p>intended to justify the dispossession of probably
</p>
<p>an hundred and fifty thousand subjects, great and
</p>
<p>mean together. As a proper corollary to this,
</p>
<p>he declared, that " his majesty not only might,
</p>
<p>but absolutely ought to dispose of the lands as
</p>
<p>he had done, in law, in conscience, and in ho-
</p>
<p>nour," although a gross violation of law, con-
</p>
<p>science, and honour. He gravely urged, that
</p>
<p>they had . " no certain estates of inheritance," t
</p>
<p>which, he says, " is manifest by two arguments,"
</p>
<p>the cogency of which cannot fail to strike the
</p>
<p>reader with some force. The first is,
</p>
<p>That " they never esteemed lawful matrimony,
</p>
<p>to the end they might have lawful heirs ;"
</p>
<p>And the second,
</p>
<p>That " they never did build any house*, nor
</p>
<p>plant orchards or gardens, nor tote any care of
</p>
<p>their posterities"
</p>
<p>Who can read such n^erable chicanery, with-
</p>
<p>out ineffable disgrat at the impudence, and ab-
</p>
<p>horrence of the fraud and imposture, that at-

<p>tempted to justify the spoliation of possessions,
</p>
<p>many of which had descended from father to son
</p>
<p>for perhaps five hundred or a thousand years,
</p>
<p>because the owners did not " esteem lawful ma-
</p>
<p>trimony" nor "plant orchards or gardens, nor
</p>
<p>build any houses?" and this covered over with the
</p>
<p>holy mantle of " law, conscience, and Jionour?"

<p>to prove, that the plantation was absolutely
</p>
<p>196 V1NDICLK HIBERNICJE.
</p>
<p>for the good of the natives; for that by this
</p>
<p>Agrarian hocus pocus, five hundred acres thence-

<p>forward would produce more than five thousand
</p>
<p>had previously done. It followed, of course, that
</p>
<p>the man who was plundered of four thousand
</p>
<p>five hundred acres out of five thousand, was
</p>
<p>actually, according to this logic, a gainer by the
</p>
<p>robbery !
</p>
<p>He closes his discourse by asserting, that the
</p>
<p>transplantation of the natives was made " more
</p>
<p>like a father, than like a lord or monarch." In
</p>
<p>proof of this position, he displays great learning
</p>
<p>on the transplantation of nations by the Romans,
</p>
<p>the Spaniards, and the English themselves, in
</p>
<p>former times ; and states, that when the English
</p>
<p>Pale was first planted, the natives were so wholly
</p>
<p>expelie^ that " not one Irish family had so much
</p>
<p>as an acre of freehold in all the Jive counties."
</p>
<p>This argument ou^t to have removed all doubts
</p>
<p>from the minds of the i^h ; as it proved that the
</p>
<p>English had, from time immemorial, a prescrip-
</p>
<p>tive right to seize then- lands, and not leave them
</p>
<p>so much as " one. acre of freehold," if they judged
</p>
<p>proper ; and, of course, that James I. did prove
</p>
<p>himself " a father," when he refrained from avail-
</p>
<p>ing himself of his rights to their full extent.
</p>
<p>The whole of the argument, if such miserable

<p>be found in the preceding note, which is par-

<p>have a fair sample of the " law, conscience, and

<p>honour," displayed towards the "savage Irish,"
</p>
<p>during the millenium of forty years, when, ac-
</p>
<p>cording to Clarendon, "whatsoever their land,
</p>
<p>labour, or industry produced, was their own,
</p>
<p>being free from fear of having it taken from them
</p>
<p>by the king, on any pretence whatsoever."
</p>
<p>It is extraordinary that the Boeotian dulness of
</p>
<p>the Irish rendered them incapable of compre-
</p>
<p>hending the cogency of Sir John Davies's reason-
</p>
<p>ing: it was too elegant and refined for their

<p>conceive why they should be stripped of their

<p>ment than Sir John, to which they were forced

<p>to submit :

<p>and plantation had been tolerably satisfied with

<p>the spoliation of Ulster, where, by a princely

<p>involved in ruin the once proud owners of

<p>princely estates, raised to rank and fortune many

<p>of the lowest orders of society, and, in a word,

<p>SPOLIATION . ON A LARGE SCALE. 201
</p>
<p>by himself, in the province of Ulster, he plun-
</p>
<p>dered his subjects, in King's and Queen's coun-
</p>
<p>ties, Leitrim, Longford, and Westmeath, of
</p>
<p>estates to the amount of three hundred and
</p>
<p>eighty-five thousand acres. Thus this vain, sot-
</p>
<p>tish, contemptible, and rapacious monarch, in a
</p>
<p>time of profound peace, at two successive opera-
</p>
<p>tions, seized about a twentieth pail of the whole
</p>
<p>island; five hundred thousand acres in Ulster,
</p>
<p>and three hundred and eighty-five thousand in
</p>
<p>Leinster : and it is more than probable, that, had
</p>
<p>his inglorious career continued as long as that of
</p>
<p>some of his successors, he would have seized
</p>
<p>every acre of the island, belonging to the Ro-
</p>
<p>man Catholics; for, after his depredations in
</p>
<p>Leinster were completed, he was seriously occu-
</p>
<p>pied in preparations for the plantation of Con-
</p>
<p>naught,* when death humanely rescued his Irish
</p>
<p>subjects from the merciless gripe of the canting,
</p>
<p>hypocritical oppressor, who had, throughout his
</p>
<p>reign, plundered them as " a father, not as a
</p>
<p>monarch" and, according to the sovereign dic-
</p>
<p>tates of " law, honour, and conscience" reduced
</p>
<p>them to beggary here, for " the good of their
</p>
<p>souls hereafter."
</p>
<p>* " The project recommended to the king was nothing less
</p>
<p>than that of establishing an extensive plantation in Connaught,
</p>
<p>SIMILAR TO THAT OF ULSTER; and, in his rage for reforma-
</p>
<p>tion, IT WAS MOST FAVOURA-BLY RECEIVED." 215

<p>But, as it was only " spoiling the Egyptians," to
</p>
<p>borrow a phrase from Rob Roy, it is passed over
</p>
<p>by Leland, Carte, and Hume, not merely as an
</p>
<p>innocent, but as a necessary measure ; nay, it
</p>
<p>appears from their statements as entitled to
</p>
<p>applause.
</p>
<p>Leland informs us, that those counties, " by
</p>
<p>their situation and circumstances, required parti-
</p>
<p>cular regulation." And what was the "particular
</p>
<p>regulation" which they required ? It was simply,
</p>
<p>that all the rights of property, held sacred among
</p>
<p>the most barbarous nations, the Moors and Al-
</p>
<p>gerines, should be basely invaded by a wretched
</p>
<p>monarch, who, as I have already hinted, has been
</p>
<p>fraudulently ranked among the civilizers and
</p>
<p>benefactors of mankind :
</p>
<p>" Naturally strong, and difficult of access, they afforded, in
</p>
<p>the very heart of the island, a safe retreat and shelter to the
</p>
<p>old inhabitants, who were tenacious of their barbarous cus-
</p>
<p>toms, nestling in their filthy cottages in winter, in summer
</p>
<p>wandering with their cattle over the mountains. Through
</p>
<p>these districts, the Irish insurgents had usually passed from
</p>
<p>Connaught or Ulster, to annoy the Pale. They had served
</p>
<p>for a passage to Tyrone and his forces into Munster, and a
</p>
<p>retreat in his inglorious flight from Kinsale. In time of peace,
</p>
<p>they were the safe receptacles of robbers, where they defied
</p>
<p>the ministers of justice ; and, surrounded with woods, bogs,
</p>
<p>and mountains, lived in a sort of independence, and contemp-
</p>
<p>tuous resistance to the law. To reduce these savages to order

<p>or any part of their lands. It was found, that some of them
</p>
<p>had been anciently possessed by English settlers, who, in the
</p>
<p>disorders of the kingdom, had been expelled by the old na-
</p>
<p>tives, and which were therefore vested in the crown, as the
</p>
<p>lands of absentees ; others appeared to have been forfeited by

<p>rebellion: So that James deemed himself entitled to make a

<p>distribution of THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-
</p>
<p>FIVE THOUSAND ACRES in these counties, to such
</p>
<p>proprietors, and in such proportions, as might promote the
</p>
<p>general welfare and security, the extension of commerce, and
</p>
<p>the civility of the natives. The large portions re-granted to
</p>
<p>the ancient proprietors, on permanent tenures, reconciled many
</p>
<p>to this new scheme of plantation." 216
</p>
<p>Language hardly affords terms of contempt and
</p>
<p>disgust, adequate to brand the writer, who can
</p>
<p>cant and whine, in extenuation of such atrocious
</p>
<p>spoliation. If the natives " nestled in filthy cot-
</p>
<p>tages," it proceeded from the oppression of the
</p>
<p>wretched government under which they groaned,
</p>
<p>and which, in the lapse of ages, hardly ever
</p>
<p>adopted a single measure dictated by sound or
</p>
<p>magnanimous policy, or calculated to claim the
</p>
<p>respect or gratitude of its Irish subjects.
</p>
<p>In the same hacknied strain, Carte cants on
</p>
<p>the subject of this immense depredation :
</p>
<p>" The peace of the kingdom was very precarious, whilst
</p>
<p>those countries remained in a sort of independence on the

<p>which he had involved the people of the six counties in Ul-

</p>
<p>I have given these statements at length, that
</p>
<p>the reader may have a full view of the grounds
</p>
<p>on which the depredation took place, and may
</p>
<p>decide on its propriety or justice, and on the
</p>
<p>merits of the writers from whom the accounts
</p>
<p>are taken. The flimsy pretext, that " the peace
</p>
<p>of the country was precarious," and that " these
</p>
<p>counties were receptacles of robbers," will not
</p>
<p>stand a moment's examination. Fraud and ra-
</p>
<p>pine never wanted a pretext of extenuation or
</p>
<p>justification. The fable of the wolf and the
</p>
<p>lamb affords a proper type of this course of
</p>
<p>proceeding.
</p>
<p>If those counties were receptacles of robbers,
</p>
<p>the proper corrective was to open assizes, and )
</p>
<p>employ courts, sheriffs, and executioners ; not to
</p>
<p>rob the people of their lands, and turn them out
</p>
<p>on the highway, to retaliate on the unwary
</p>
<p>passenger the depredations they suffered from
</p>
<p>those whose office imposed on them the duty of
</p>
<p>protection.
</p>
<p>The admission of such a paltry defence of so

<p>base a system of rapine and plunder, reflects

</p>
<p>they the slightest knowledge of their duty, or did

<p>and reprobation, 'which it had so richly earned.

<p>There was not a subject in his dominions, whose

</p>
<p>In the " famous northern plantation, so honour-

<p>able to king James," according to the very accu-

<p>rate Leland, we have seen that the natives were
</p>
<p>despoiled of the paltry modicum of the soil,
</p>
<p>which the rapacity of the monarch had allotted
</p>
<p>them, to support a miserable existence. As
</p>
<p>might be expected, the Leinster adventurers, in
</p>
<p>order to keep their Ulster friends in countenance^
</p>
<p>followed their captivating example, and defrauded
</p>
<p>the natives to precisely the same extent. This
</p>
<p>verifies the old Latin adage,

<p>" In the county of Longford, the natives in general had
</p>
<p>scarce a third part of their former possessions, either in number

<p>of acres or in value of profitable ground, allotted them. The

<p>a great latitude of judgment was left to the commissioners,
</p>
<p>which some of them knnu how to make use of for their ad-

<p>vantage.

</p>
<p>profitable land, and had only a small pittance, less than a fourth
</p>
<p>part, assigned them for it, in barren ground." 218
</p>
<p>" In the small county of Longford, we find that twenty-jive
</p>
<p>of one sept ivere all deprived of their estates, without the least

<p>compensation, or any means of subsistence allotted them" 219
</p>
<p>We may form a tolerably accurate idea of the
</p>
<p>frightful extent to which the spirit of rapine was

<p>earned, from the specimen here exhibited. What

<p>a hideous specimen ! Proprietors expelled from

<p>counties, and owning one thousand acres, worth

<p>one hundred and fifty dollars per acre, expelled

<p>of the barren lands of Northumberland or Ly-

<p>fifty dollars, as an equivalent for an hundred and

<p>were employed " to reduce those savages to order

<p>Projected spoliation of Connaught. Jury fined

<p>eighty thousand pounds sterling, for not per-
</p>
<p>juring themselves by a false -verdict. Historical
</p>
<p>obliquity.
</p>
<p>THE project formed by the pious James, of
</p>
<p>an extensive plantation in Connaught, for the
</p>
<p>purpose of spoiling the Egyptians, those wretches
</p>
<p>who " did not esteem lawful matrimony," who
</p>
<p>" built no houses, and planted no orchards nor
</p>
<p>gardens," was, as shown in the preceding chap-
</p>
<p>ter, defeated by death, who snatched him away,
</p>
<p>in the midst of his career, to render an account,
</p>
<p>in another world, before the omniscient Judge of
</p>
<p>mankind, of his rapine and depredation in this.
</p>
<p>But, alas ! the respite thus afforded to the western ,
</p>
<p>province of Ireland, was of short duration. Dur-
</p>
<p>ing the succeeding reign, the nefarious project
</p>
<p>was revived, by the arrogant, rapacious, and vin-
</p>
<p>dictive Wentworth, who meditated nothing less,
</p>
<p>according to Leland, than the subversion of the
</p>
<p>title of every estate in the province.*
</p>
<p>* " His project was nothing less than to subvert the title to
</p>
<p>every estate in every part of Connaught, and to establish a new
</p>
<p>plantation through this whole province ; a project, which,

</p>
<p>For this stupendous scheme, Wentworth was
</p>
<p>peculiarly fitted. He possessed great energy of
</p>
<p>character, and talents of a high order ; but was
</p>
<p>withheld by no sense of shame, no tie of honour,
</p>
<p>no regard to equity, and no " compunctious visit-
</p>
<p>ings of conscience." He completely filled Sal-
</p>
<p>lust's character of Catiline :
</p>
<p>" Alien! appetens, sui profusus."
</p>
<p>Thus fortified with every requisite of head and
</p>
<p>heart to qualify him for a remorseless oppressor,
</p>
<p>he undertook to carry this project into execu-
</p>
<p>when first proposed, in the late reign, was received with hor-
</p>
<p>ror and amazement, but which suited the undismayed and
</p>
<p>enterprising genius of lord Wentworth. For this he had
</p>
<p>opposed the confirmation of the royal graces, transmitted to
</p>
<p>lord Faulkland, and taken to himself the odium of so flagrant
</p>
<p>a violation of the royal promise. The parliament was at an
</p>
<p>end j and the deputy at leisure to execute a scheme, which, as
</p>
<p>it was offensive and alarming, required a cautious and delibe-
</p>
<p>rate procedure. Old records of state, and the memorials of
</p>
<p>ancient monasteries, were ransacked, to ascertain the king's
</p>
<p>original title to Connaught. It was soon discovered, that in
</p>
<p>the grant of Henry the Third to Richard De Burgo, five can-
</p>
<p>treds ivere reserved to the crown, adjacent to the castle
</p>
<p>of Athlone ; that THIS GRANT INCLUDED THE
</p>
<p>WHOLE REMAINDER OF THE PROVINCE, which
</p>
<p>was now alleged to have been forfeited by Aedn O'Connor,
</p>
<p>the Irish provincial chieftain ; that the lands and lordship of
</p>
<p>De Burgo, descended lineally to Edward the Fourth; and
</p>
<p>were confirmed to the crown by a statute of Henry the Se-
</p>
<p>venth. The ingenuity of court lawyers was employed to
</p>
<p>invalidate all patents granted to the possessors of these lands,
</p>
<p>from the reign of queen Elizabeth." 220

<p>the convulsions in Scotland arid England, which
</p>
<p>called him to aid his master, in whose cause he
</p>
<p>lost a head which his career in Ireland had indu-
</p>
<p>bitably forfeited.
</p>
<p>Few men have performed a distinguished part
</p>
<p>in society, whose history is so contradictorily
</p>
<p>narrated. A correct account of, him is stih 1 a
</p>
<p>desideratum. Clarendon, Nalson, Carte, Hume,
</p>
<p>and all the long train of monarchical writers,
</p>
<p>whine and lament over his grave, as if he had
</p>
<p>been a mirror of virtue, a Phocion, an Aristi-
</p>
<p>des, a Socrates, a De Witt, or a Washington ;
</p>
<p>and as if he had been offered up, an immaculate
</p>
<p>victim, to popular rage. But those who take a
</p>
<p>correct view of his career, must acknowledge
</p>
<p>that he was a bloated mass of almost every spe-
</p>
<p>cies of vice and crime of which a public officer
</p>
<p>is capable.
</p>
<p>Candour, however, calls for the acknowledg-
</p>
<p>ment that the proceedings against him, in the
</p>
<p>trial of the impeachment, were in many respects
</p>
<p>informal and irregular ; and that he was offered
</p>
<p>up, by the republican party in the Long Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, full as much to appease their resentment
</p>
<p>at his apostacy from their cause, and to allay
</p>
<p>their fears of his talents and influence, as for his
</p>
<p>crimes, atrocious as they were. But, whatever

<p>pietely sanctioned by the claims of substantial
</p>
<p>justice. No man ever had much less reason to
</p>
<p>complain of informality : for whoever compares
</p>
<p>the proceedings on his trial, with those on the
</p>
<p>trial of lord Mountnorris, will be satisfied that
</p>
<p>there was as much difference between them, as
</p>
<p>between the court of Herod or Pontius Pilate,
</p>
<p>and that of Trajan or Antoninus. The proceed-
</p>
<p>ings of the court held on lord Mountnorris were
</p>
<p>of the most murderous character.
</p>
<p>It is not extravagant to aver, that the aggre-
</p>
<p>gate crimes of hundreds of men, who have been
</p>
<p>offered up on gibbets, as victims to offended
</p>
<p>Justice, for depredations on property, would not
</p>
<p>equal the guilt of one single act of Wentworth,
</p>
<p>the fine imposed on the sheriff and grand jury of
</p>
<p>Galway : the naked fact of which case is, that the
</p>
<p>jurors, probably twenty in number, were each
</p>
<p>fined four thousand pounds, or eighty thousand
</p>
<p>pounds sterling, equal, according to the present
</p>
<p>value of money, to about two hundred thousand
</p>
<p>pounds, or nearly nine hundred thousand dollars,
</p>
<p>because they resisted the depredations of this
</p>
<p>modern Aristides, and refused to find a title in
</p>
<p>the crown, grounded on the invasion of Henry II.
</p>
<p>or on claims arising immediately from that

<p>source. The sheriff was fined a thousand pounds,

<p>for returning such a jury. More of this anon.

<p>of his royal master, and the benevolence of his

<p>views towards his good subjects of Connaught.

<p>But the jet of it was the comfortable information,

<p>that his majesty was indifferent whether they

<p>idea that he would adopt some other mode of
</p>
<p>attaining his right ; the "path of which lay so open

<p>county of Leitrim had already acknowledged the king's title

<p>to their lands, and submitted to a plantation. It was now

<p>fine in the castle-chamber, in case they should prevaricate.''
</p>
<p>They were told by Wentworth, that his majesty's intention,

<p>in establishing- his undoubted title, was to make them a rich
</p>
<p>and civil people ; that he purposed not to deprive them of their
</p>
<p>iust possessions, but to invest them with a considerable part

<p>of his own ; that he needed not their interposition, to vindi-

<p>cate his right, which might be established by the usual course

<p>of law, upon an information of intrusion ; but that he wished

<p>his people to share with him in the honour and profit of the

</p>
<p>One part of this address has escaped much
</p>
<p>observation heretofore, which nevertheless de-
</p>
<p>serves the most pointed attention.' It would
</p>
<p>afford room for a commentary of a vohime on
</p>
<p>the hideous oppression and rapacity of the Irish
</p>
<p>government :
</p>
<p>" To manifest his majesty's justice and honour, I thought
</p>
<p>fit to let them know," says the satrap, " that it was his majes-
</p>
<p>ty's gracious pleasure, that any mail's counsel should be fully
</p>
<p>and willingly heard, in defence of their respective rights ; be-
</p>
<p>ing A FAVOUR NEVER BEFORE AFFORDED TO ANY, UPON
</p>
<p>TAKING THESE KIND OF INQJJISITIONS." 223
</p>
<p>Here a pause, a solemn pause, is necessary.
</p>
<p>A government, whose paramount duty is to pro-
</p>
<p>tect the persons and property of its subjects,
</p>
<p>pursues for centuries a piratical system of legal
</p>
<p>warfare on their property ; it advances claims
</p>
<p>to estates, one, two, three, or four hundred years
</p>
<p>old ; it hangs fines and imprisonment over the
</p>
<p>heads of the jurors ; it bribes the judges ; and let
</p>
<p>it be deeply engraven on the mind of every man
</p>
<p>of candour, that, for above four hundred years,
</p>
<p>the men whose estates it sought to spoliate, were
</p>
<p>never, till the time of Wentworth, allowed the
</p>
<p>favour of " being heard, by counsel, in defence of
</p>
<p>their respective rights!" Tripoli, Algiers, and
</p>
<p>Morocco might be safely defied to produce a
</p>
<p>parallel.

<p>ADMIRABLE PROOFS OP PROPERTY. 215
</p>
<p>The reader cannot be surprised that the jurors
</p>
<p>of Roscommon, under these circumstances, found
</p>
<p>for the crown. Nothing less could have been
</p>
<p>expected :
</p>
<p>" The presence and interposition of a lord deputy, whose
</p>
<p>character and temper were fitted to operate on men's passions,
</p>
<p>had probably their full effect on this occasion. The king's
</p>
<p>title was found, without scruple or hesitation ; and the verdict
</p>
<p>attended with a petition for an equitable treatment of present
</p>
<p>proprietors, and a due provision for the church." 224
</p>
<p>The example of Roscommon had a decided
</p>
<p>influence on the counties of Mayo and Sligo,
</p>
<p>where the king's title was found, without diffi-
</p>
<p>culty.
</p>
<p>Galway remained. All the arts of the deputy
</p>
<p>were in vain. The jury refused to find the MUs ;
</p>
<p>and, as already stated, were enormously fined
</p>
<p>and imprisoned.* '
</p>
<p>* " The jury of the county of Galway was summoned to meet
</p>
<p>at Portumna, on Aug. 13, 1635, and consisted of the principal
</p>
<p>gentlemen of the, county. The king's title to all the lands in
</p>
<p>it, except such as belonged to the church, or had been granted
</p>
<p>out by the patents of his predecessors, WAS PROVED BY
</p>
<p>THE CONQUEST OF KING HENRY II. and the grant

<p>he made of it to Roderic, lord of Connaught ; by the grant of

<p>Henry III. to Richard De Burgo, of twenty-five cantreds,

<p>out of thirty, whereof the whole consists, upon a rent of three
</p>
<p>hundred marks for the first five years, and of five hundred

<p>for ever afterwards ; and by the payment of this rent into the
</p>
<p>exchequer, and the allowances thereof in the sheriff's accompt

<p>It is painful to find, that every step we take in

<p>proved the latter ; that, in tracing the descent to Edward IV.

<p>and when called upon to declare in whom the freehold was

<p>vested, (if not in the crown) they refused to do so. The lord

<p>would be of ill example to the rest of the kingdom, and would

<p>retard, if not defeat, the execution of his project, caused the

</p>
<p>naught spoliation, unsupported by letter-dropping,
</p>
<p>conspiracy, rebellion, or any accusation of not
</p>
<p>building houses or planting orchards.
</p>
<p>Of all the various instances of the obliquity of
</p>
<p>Carte's history, there is none more extraordinary
</p>
<p>than the view he gives of this hideous affair. He
</p>
<p>absolutely defends the proceedings of Strafford ;
</p>
<p>and unqualifiedly censures the jury, who, " on
</p>
<p>the evidence produced, ought to have found," he
</p>
<p>says, " as their neighbours had found." Among
</p>
<p>his accusations of the jury, the first is, their
</p>
<p>grounding their refusal of finding a title to the
</p>
<p>province, on " THE PRETENCE," as this prejudiced
</p>
<p>historian says, " that the subjection of the coun-
</p>
<p>try under Henry II. was a submission, not a con-
</p>
<p>quest." In what a state of delirium must the
</p>
<p>mind of the man be, who could be so far lost to
</p>
<p>a sense of reason or justice, as to style this sound
</p>
<p>and irrefragable plea " a pretence" or to coun-
</p>
<p>tenance any claims resting on such untenable
</p>
<p>ground ! That in a country, which for centuries
</p>
<p>had been despoiled on pretexts as iniquitous,
</p>
<p>such claims should be advanced by a depredator
</p>
<p>of the character of Wentworth, is not wonderful :
</p>
<p>but that an historian, writing, a century after-
</p>
<p>wards, with all the facts before him, on which to

<p>form a correct estimate, should for a moment

<p>admit that the titles to estates, held in the same

<p>lion of the conquest or submission of the country,
</p>
<p>is inexpressibly astonishing. The invasion of
</p>
<p>Henry took place in 1172 ; and the spoliation of
</p>
<p>Connaught was projected in 1636, that is, four
</p>
<p>hundred and sixty-four years afterwards. Of what
</p>
<p>consequence could it have been to the proprietors
</p>
<p>of estates, what was the character of the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings of Henry, whether he received a sub-
</p>
<p>mission, or made a conquest ? Suppose it a
</p>
<p>submission : does it thence follow, that Charles I.
</p>
<p>had a right to an acre, or even a perch, of an
</p>
<p>estate that had descended from heir to heir, for
</p>
<p>the intermediate four centuries and a half? Sup-
</p>
<p>pose it invasion : does that enhance the strength
</p>
<p>of the claim ? Had every man, woman, and
</p>
<p>child in the whole nation been subdued by, and
</p>
<p>sworn allegiance to, Henry II. or, to give the
</p>
<p>argument its utmost force, Henry V. VI. VII. or
</p>
<p>VIII. could that warrant a jury in finding a title in
</p>
<p>the crown to the whole of the soil ; or justify the
</p>
<p>imposition of a fine of eighty thousand pounds
</p>
<p>sterling on the jury, for not finding such title ?
</p>
<p>Could any thing but the most rampant spirit of
</p>
<p>rapine ever lay a claim on such wretched ground,
</p>
<p>or any thing but the most dire insanity or obli-
</p>
<p>quity of mind ever undertake the palliation of

<p>the vile deed ?

<p>troubles at home, which gave them much more
</p>
<p>serious and finally fatal employment than plun-
</p>
<p>dering the inhabitants of Connaught.
</p>
<p>We have asserted, that the judges were bribed.
</p>
<p>This is recorded by Wentworth's own hand. To
</p>
<p>ensure the assistance of the court, he advised the
</p>
<p>king to bestow on the lord chief justice and the
</p>
<p>chief baron, four shillings in the pound, from
</p>
<p>the first yearly rent raised out of the depredated
</p>
<p>estates, in order to interest them in promoting
</p>
<p>the rapine. The "royal martyr" worthy of
</p>
<p>such a representative, gave, and the judges, wor-
</p>
<p>thy of such a monarch and such a deputy, re-
</p>
<p>ceived, the wages of their prostitution.
</p>
<p>Well might Shakspeare exclaim,
</p>
<p>" Thieves for their robbery have authority,
</p>
<p>When judges steal themselves."
</p>
<p>The brilje had the desired effect : for Went-
</p>
<p>worth says,
</p>
<p>" I have found it, upon observation, to be the best given
</p>
<p>that ever was ; for that by these me,ans they attend that busi-
</p>
<p>ness with as much care and diligence as if it had been their
</p>
<p>own private ; and that every four shillings, once paid, would
</p>
<p>better his majesty'' s revenue four pounds" 3 **
</p>
<p>Who can read this odious detail, without
</p>
<p>standing aghast with horror ? A king conspires
</p>
<p>with his vicegerent, to despoil his defenceless
</p>
<p>subjects ; and, to ensure success in their flagitious

<p>undertaking, they tender a manifest bribe to the

<p>of this bribe depends on the extent of the depre-
</p>
<p>dation. They agree to share among them the
</p>
<p>spoils ; which are divided into five parts, four of
</p>
<p>which fall to the share of the king and deputy,
</p>
<p>the master plunderers ; and the fifth to their

</p>
<p>king is by bigoted royalists reverenced as an
</p>
<p>English Marcus Aurelius, the exemplar of every
</p>
<p>royal virtue !
</p>
<p>But the hardened and iniquitous Wentworth
</p>
<p>was not satisfied with corrupting the judges. He
</p>
<p>paid equal attention to the jurors, of whom he
</p>
<p>sought out two kinds ; one poor and needy, who
</p>
<p>might easily be bribed, "fit men to serve on juries^
</p>
<p>who would gwe furtherance to the king's title;"
</p>
<p>and the other veiy wealthy, whom he might
</p>
<p>plunder, by heavy fines, if they prevaricated, as
</p>
<p>he called it. In the latter case, he would have,
</p>
<p>to use his own words, " persons of such means
</p>
<p>as might answer to the king in a round fine, in

<p>a surrender of their estates to the crown ; and for that purpose
</p>
<p>sent a letter of attorney to the earl of Clanrickard, then at
</p>
<p>London, signed by one hundred and twenty-five persons of
</p>
<p>the best quality in the county. ' At the same time, the still

<p>fine would be apter to produce the desired effect
</p>
<p>in such persons, than in others who had little or
</p>
<p>nothing to lose." 227
</p>
<p>The villany of this scheme of depredation far
</p>
<p>exceeded that practised in former times. Some
</p>
<p>attention had been till now paid to letters patent,
</p>
<p>duly authenticated from the crown. These were
</p>
<p>generally regarded as affording proofs of good
</p>
<p>titles ; and rescued the possessors from the ruin
</p>
<p>inflicted on their neighbours. But the chief part
</p>
<p>of the lands, proposed to be spoliated by Went-
</p>
<p>worth, being fenced round with patents, he found
</p>
<p>dition only that they and the rest might be put upon the same
</p>
<p>footing with the other planted counties ; for in these cases,
</p>
<p>the general rule was, that a fourth part of their land should be
</p>
<p>taken from the natives, with an increase of rent upon the re-
</p>
<p>mainder ; but the county of Galway, on account of its former
</p>
<p>refractoriness, was planted at a double rate ; so that they lost
</p>
<p>half.'
</p>
<p>" Wentworth was so far from being satisfied with this sub-
</p>
<p>missive petition and offer, that he insisted upon a public ac-
</p>
<p>knowledgment from these jurors, of their having committed not
</p>
<p>only an error in judgment, but even actual perjury, in the ver-
</p>
<p>dict they had given -, which being refused by them, he, be-
</p>
<p>sides planting their country at the rate before mentioned, pro-
</p>
<p>cured an order from the king, that their agents in London
</p>
<p>should be sent prisoners to Dublin, to be tried before himself
</p>
<p>in the castle-chamber, for having dared to patronise their
</p>
<p>cause. These severities, however, raised no small apprehen-
</p>
<p>sions in some that were about the king, and even the king
</p>
<p>himself, lest they might disaffect the people of Ireland, and
</p>
<p>dispose them to call over the Irish regiments from Flanders

<p>CHAPTER X.
</p>
<p>Wide-spread scene of private spoliation. Needy

<p>projectors and rapacious courtiers. Defective

<p>titles.
</p>
<p>IN the last chapters, we have exhibited the
</p>
<p>unbridled spirit of rapine and plunder, by which
</p>
<p>the Irish were despoiled by then* government,
</p>
<p>during the grand millenium of lord Clarendon
</p>
<p>and Dr. Warner.
</p>
<p>But, execrable as were those proceedings, and
</p>
<p>profligate and abandoned as were the rulers by
</p>
<p>whom they were perpetrated, the sufferings and
</p>
<p>spoliations experienced by the Irish, from indivi-
</p>
<p>dual rapacity,* far exceeded them, in the wide
</p>
<p>* " Ireland had long been a prey to projectors and greedy
</p>
<p>courtiers, who procured grants of concealed lands ; and, by
</p>
<p>setting up the king's title, forced the right owners of them, to
</p>
<p>avoid the plague and expense of a litigation, to compound with
</p>
<p>them on -what terms they pleased. It was high time to put a
</p>
<p>stop to so scandalous a traffic, which reflected dishonour upon
</p>
<p>the crown, alienated the minds of the people from the govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and raised CONTINUAL CLAMOURS AND UNEASINESS IN
</p>
<p>EVERY PART OF THE KINGDOM. Many proprietors of lands
</p>
<p>could derive no title from the crown; the letters patents of
</p>
<p>others were insufficient in law, defective, doubtful, or not plain
</p>
<p>enough to prevent dispute. Commissions had been granted,

</p>
<p>made with the commissioners. But, as these commissions
</p>
<p>were afterwards either renewed or recalled, and new ones is-
</p>
<p>sued out, it was questioned whether, by such later commis-
</p>
<p>sions, the said former commissions, and the compositions
</p>
<p>grounded thereupon, were not revoked, countermanded, and
</p>
<p>annulled.

</p>
<p>defective, uncertain, or not extend to give the commissioners as
</p>
<p>much power and authority as they exercised in making com-

<p>suming every thing to be rightly done, by persons duly au-

<p>thorized, and his own possession to be fully assured to him,
</p>
<p>found himself mistaken in the end. For if either the commis-

</p>
<p>lost, or not enrolled and recorded ; if the lands and tenements
</p>
<p>granted, or intended to be granted, in the letters patents, were
</p>
<p>mis-named, mis-recited, or not named and recited therein ; if
</p>
<p>offices and inquisitions had not been found, for proof of the
</p>
<p>king's title, before the making of such grants or letters patents ;
</p>
<p>or if there were any defect in such offices and inquisitions ;
</p>
<p>if there were any omission of sufficient and special non ob-

<p>stantes of particular statutes, that ought to have been men-
</p>

</p>
<p>This is perfectly natural ; and what might have
</p>
<p>been inferred from the proceedings of the rulers,
</p>
<p>even were history silent on the subject. The
</p>
<p>experience of the world proves, that severe laws
</p>
<p>and good government frequently fail to repress
</p>
<p>fraud and violence, even when corporal punish-
</p>
<p>ments and penalties are held out in terrorem, to
</p>
<p>awe the offenders. But, we repeat, when a
</p>
<p>government assumes the aspect of the plunderer,
</p>
<p>and sets the alluring example of spoliation ;
</p>
<p>when it violates, in the most profligate manner,
</p>
<p>the rights of property, held by regular descent,
</p>
<p>for ages ; when, with sacrilegious hand, it tears
</p>
<p>down all the barriers erected by law, honour,
</p>
<p>honesty, and justice ; but, more particularly than
</p>
<p>all the rest, when it divides a nation into two
</p>
<p>casts, and prostrates one, tied neck and heels,
</p>
<p>at the feet of the other, as the Helots were at the
</p>
<p>feet of the Spartans, the native Irish, previous
</p>
<p>of any part thereof, were not truly set forth and named j or if,
</p>
<p>in grants to corporations and bodies politic, whether spiritual
</p>
<p>or temporal, the right style, by which they were denominated
</p>
<p>and distinguished, was not used : in all these, and MANY
</p>
<p>OTHER CASES, the letters patents were liable to be disputed and
</p>
<p>set aside. This rendered all possessions very precarious ; and
</p>
<p>there were Jew gentlemen in the kingdom, but had been, some
</p>
<p>time or other, questioned for their title, or disturbed in the
</p>
<p>enjoyment of their estates. The inconveniences whereof were
</p>
<p>very visible, in the discouragement of husbandry (few persons
</p>
<p>caring to improve lands which they cannot call their own) and
</p>
<p>in the general dissatisfaction of the people." 230

<p>RAPACIOUS PROJECTORS. 227
</p>
<p>Such was the hideous picture exhibited in
</p>
<p>Ireland, during that period, which the world,
</p>
<p>deluded by dishonest writers, of great but unde-
</p>
<p>served celebrity, has been universally led to
</p>
<p>regard as " a blessed condition of peace and
</p>
<p>security"
</p>
<p>The great extent of the last chapters precludes
</p>
<p>the necessity of being prolix with the present
</p>
<p>one. I shall therefore be as brief as possible,
</p>
<p>and reduce it within narrow bounds.
</p>
<p>The land was covered with hosts of pimps,
</p>
<p>spies, and informers, whose eternal employment
</p>
<p>was finding flaws in the titles of gentlemen's
</p>
<p>estates, and, if possible, ejecting them, in which
</p>
<p>they were constantly countenanced by govern-
</p>
<p>ment ; or, if they failed in this part of the project,
</p>
<p>forcing them to ruinous compositions.
</p>
<p>" Needy projectors and rapacious courtiers still continued
</p>
<p>the scandalous traffic of pleading the king's title against the
</p>
<p>possessors of estates , of seizing their lands, or forcing them to
</p>
<p>grievous compositions"* 31
</p>
<p>We have asserted that this system of rapine
</p>
<p>was more oppressive than that of James. A
</p>
<p>moment's reflection will satisfy every reader on
</p>
<p>this point. That miserable king only spoliated
</p>
<p>a twentieth part of the island ; whereas the
</p>
<p>their advice and council, one hundred and fifty letters patents
</p>
<p>were avoided in one morning; which course continued until all
</p>
<p>the patents of the kingdom, to a few, were by them and their
</p>
<p>associates declarsd void." 232

<p>inhabitants of the remaining nineteen-twentieths.
</p>
<p>In the preceding note, page 225, Carte expressly
</p>
<p>informs us, that " there were few gentlemen in
</p>
<p>the kingdom, who had not been, some time or
</p>
<p>other, questioned for their title, or disturbed in
</p>
<p>the possession of their estates."
</p>
<p>" They who were too poor or too spiritless to engage in
</p>
<p>distant adventures, courted fortune in Ireland. Under pre-
</p>
<p>tence of improving the king's revenue in a country where it
</p>
<p>was far less than the charge of government, they obtained
</p>
<p>commissions of inquiry into defective titles, and grants of con-
</p>
<p>cealed lands and rents belonging to the crown ; the great benefit
</p>
<p>of which was generally to accrue to the projector, whilst the
</p>
<p>king had but an inconsiderable proportion of the concealment, or
</p>
<p>a small advance of rent. DISCOVERERS WERE EVERY WHERE
</p>
<p>BUSILY EMPLOYED IN FINDING OUT FLAWS IN MEN'S TITLES
</p>
<p>TO THEIR ESTATES. The old pipe-rolls were searched, to
</p>
<p>find the original rents with which they had been charged. The
</p>
<p>patent rolls, in the tower of London, were ransacked for the
</p>
<p>ancient grants. No means of industry, or DEVICES, were left
</p>
<p>untried, to force the possessors to accept of nerv grants, at an
</p>
<p>advanced rent. In general, men were either conscious of the
</p>
<p>defects in their titles, or alarmed at the trouble and expense of
</p>
<p>a contest with the crown, or fearful of the issue of such a con-
</p>
<p>test, at a time, and in a country, where the prerogative was
</p>
<p>highly strained, and strenuously supported by the judges.
</p>
<p>These inquiries, therefore, commonly ended in a new compo-
</p>
<p>sition, made at as cheap a rate, and as easy an advance of rent,
</p>
<p>as the possessors could obtain."^ 33

</p>
<p>TO palliate, or even to justify, these spoliations,
</p>
<p>the Irish of that era are represented as rude,

<p>barbarous, savage, and intolerant of law and or-

<p>means justify the proceedings which we have

<p>which warrants a civilized man in seizing the

<p>possessions of him who is, or whom he pretends

<p>to be, uncivilized. Any law that would have

<p>warranted James, in his conduct to his Ulster

<p>be more readily defended than James. The

<p>depredations of others.
</p>
<p>But here we meet the slanderers, who give
</p>
<p>such hideous accounts of the Irish, on the very
</p>
<p>threshold ; and are able to stamp on their fore-
</p>
<p>heads the seal of falsehood in the most legible
</p>
<p>characters. The evidence we produce is such
</p>
<p>as no man living will dare dispute. It is not de-
</p>
<p>rived from O'Sullivan, O'Connor, O'Halloran, or
</p>
<p>Curry. To these writers, objections of partiality
</p>
<p>would be made, by those prejudiced men who
</p>
<p>delight in every thing, however gross, however
</p>
<p>unjust, that defames or destroys the Irish charac-
</p>
<p>ter. We appeal to Patrick Finglass, Esq. chief
</p>
<p>baron of the exchequer, under Henry VIII. to
</p>
<p>Coke, the author of the Institutes, and to that
</p>
<p>John Davies, king James's attorney-general m
</p>
<p>Ireland, who brought the accusation against the
</p>
<p>inhabitants of Ulster, of " not building houses nor
</p>
<p>planting orchards" to prove that they had no
</p>
<p>lands of inheritance.
</p>
<p>Baron Finglass places the Irish character on
</p>
<p>far higher ground than that of the English, so
</p>
<p>far as respects submission to law and justice :
</p>
<p>" It is a great abusion and reproach, that the laws and sta-
</p>
<p>tuts made in this lond are not observed ne kept, after the
</p>
<p>making of theme, eight days ; which matter is oone of the dis-
</p>
<p>tractions of Englishmen of this lond : and divers Irishmen doth

<p>Edward Coke delivers his opinion of the Irish,
</p>
<p>in a high and encomiastic style of commendation:
</p>
<p>" I have been informed by many of those that have had
</p>
<p>judicial places there, and [know] partly of my own knowledge,
</p>
<p>that THERE IS NO NATION OF THE CHRISTIAN
</p>
<p>WORLD THAT ARE GREATER LOVERS OF JUS-
</p>
<p>TICE than they are ; which virtue must of course be accompa-
</p>
<p>nied by many others ," 235
</p>
<p>In portraying the Irish character, Sir John
</p>
<p>Davies has displayed more talent and candour
</p>
<p>than are to be found in his forensic development
</p>
<p>of the rights of inheritance.
</p>
<p>" They will gladly continue in this condition of subjects,
</p>
<p>without defection, or adhering to any other lord or king, as
</p>
<p>long as they may be protected and justly governed, -without
</p>
<p>oppression on the one side, or impunity on the other. For
</p>
<p>THERE IS NO PEOPLE UNDER THE SUN THAT
</p>
<p>DOTH LOVE EQUAL AND INDIFFERENT JUS-
</p>
<p>TICE BETTER THAN THE IRISH; or -will rest better
</p>
<p>satisjied with the execution thereof, although it be against
</p>
<p>themselves ; so that they may have the protection and benefit
</p>
<p>of the law, -when upon just cause they do desire z^." 23 , 6
</p>
<p>" I dare affirm, that in the space of five years last past,
</p>
<p>there have not been found so many malefactors worthy of
</p>
<p>death, in all the six circuits of this realm, which is now di-
</p>
<p>vided into thirty-two shires at large, as in one circuit of six
</p>

<p>the polished and refined Highlanders, for whom

<p>their countryman James despoiled the Irish of

<p>civilize a nation, of which the agent of their
</p>
<p>despoiler bore this exalted testimony, tiiat " no

</p>
<p>beaux and belles to dance cotillions and minuets.

<p>man could for a moment suppose that these

<p>flatter the Irish, the Helots of England : and if it

<p>be true, as it must be, then is it clear that it would
</p>
<p>have been full as correct and as wise, perhaps
</p>
<p>more so, to make a plantation of Irish in Scot-
</p>
<p>land or England, to civilize those nations, as to
</p>
<p>introduce the Scotch or English into Ireland, for
</p>
<p>the same benevolent purpose. These nations, at

<p>that period, carried on their border wars with a

<p>ruthless and infernal ferocity, barbarity, and de-

<p>escaped. To remove all doubt on the subject, I
</p>
<p>submit a specimen of a five days' inroad into Scot-
</p>
<p>land, by the earl of Sussex, about thirty years
</p>
<p>previous to the famous northern plantation.
</p>
<p>" A Note of a Journey into Twiddle, by the earl of Sussex,
</p>
<p>her majesties lieutenant in the north, begun the 17th of April,
</p>
<p>'1570, and ending the 22dofthe same.
</p>
<p>" The 17th of April, 1570, the earl of Sussex and the lord
</p>
<p>Hunsdon, governor of Berwick, with all the garrisons and
</p>
<p>power of the east marches, came to Warke, and entered into
</p>
<p>Tividale, in Scotland, the 18th, at the break of day, and burnt
</p>
<p>all the castles and towns as they went, until they came to the
</p>
<p>castle of Moss, standing in a strong marsh, and belonging to
</p>
<p>the lord of Fernhurst, which they burnt and razed, and so
</p>
<p>burnt the country until they came to Craling.
</p>
<p>" The same day, Sir John Foster, with all the garrisons
</p>
<p>and force of the middle marches, entered into Tividale and
</p>
<p>Expesgate Head, sixteen miles from Warke, and so burnt all
</p>
<p>the country, until they came to a strong castle, in the posses-
</p>
<p>sion of the mother of lord Fernhurst, which he burnt and
</p>
<p>razed; and so burnt all the other castles and towns, until he
</p>
<p>came to Craling, where both companies met, and so went up
</p>
<p>the river of Tivit, and burnt and threw down all the castles
</p>
<p>and towns upon the river, until they came to Jedworth, where
</p>
<p>they lodged this day.
</p>
<p>" The 19th, the army was divided into two parts, whereof
</p>
<p>the one did pass the river of Tivit, and burnt and razed the
</p>
<p>castle of Fernhurst, Hunthill, and Bederoll, and passed on to
</p>
<p>Minte : and the other part of the army burnt in like sort on the
</p>
<p>other side of the river Tivit, until he came to Hawick.
</p>
<p>" The 20th, the army went to Branshaw, the lord of Buck-
</p>
<p>lough's house, which was wholly overthrown with powder ;
</p>
<p>and then divided and burnt, on the north of the river of Tivit,
</p>

<p>The barbarity of English warfare, about that

<p>committed such scenes of havoc and destruction, as would

<p>Representation in Parliament. Fraud, -venality,

<p>and corruption of the executive, legislative, and
</p>
<p>judiciary. Rotten boroughs. Record of infamy,
</p>
<p>on the Journals of the House of Commons.
</p>
<p>WE have fully established the non-existence of
</p>
<p>lord Clarendon's golden age, under three great
</p>
<p>aspects, freedom of religion, security of person,
</p>
<p>and security of property. We have proved it as

<p>Parliament. To this we invite the reader's at-

<p>tention.
</p>
<p>Under a free and independent Parliament,
</p>
<p>Ireland could not possibly have suffered the tithe
</p>
<p>of the oppressions of which the reader has had
</p>
<p>an indistinct bird's-eye view ; but which, at full

</p>
<p>as the deputies that swayed the sceptre there.

<p>PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATION. 239
</p>
<p>In a Parliament correctly constituted, the in-
</p>
<p>terests of the representatives would have been
</p>
<p>so completely identified with those of their con-
</p>
<p>stituents, that it would have been impossible to
</p>
<p>have subjected the exercise of the national reli-
</p>
<p>gion to pains and penalties, at the will, as we have
</p>
<p>already said, of a paltry minority of two-thir-
</p>
<p>teenths of the nation, at most ; or to have en-
</p>
<p>acted any of those barbarous statutes which ren-
</p>
<p>dered the legislation of Ireland, for centuries, an
</p>
<p>object of abhorrence and detestation.
</p>
<p>We shall consider the subject of representation
</p>
<p>under four different heads :
</p>
<p>I. The periods of the meeting of Parliament ;
</p>
<p>II. The modes of election ;
</p>
<p>III. The manner of framing laws ; and
</p>
<p>IV. The freedom of debate.
</p>
<p>And it cannot fail to appear, that, in this re-
</p>
<p>spect, Ireland was as flagrantly oppressed, as we
</p>
<p>have seen under the preceding heads.
</p>
<p>I. Periods of Meeting.
</p>
<p>From the twenty-ninth year of Elizabeth, anno
</p>
<p>1587, to the fifteenth of Charles I. anno 1639,
</p>
<p>embracing a period of fifty-two years, there were
</p>
<p>but two Parliaments held in Ireland ; one in
</p>
<p>1613, under James I. ; and the other in 1634-5,
</p>
<p>under Charles I. 243 Thus were the powers of
</p>
<p>legislation wholly suspended, in one instance,
</p>
<p>for twenty-six, and in another for twenty-one

<p>yeai*s. The legislative functions, in the mean
</p>
<p>time, were usurped and abused by the executive
</p>
<p>officers, who passed acts of state, which had all the
</p>
<p>efficacy of acts of Parliament, and were enforced
</p>
<p>by fine and imprisonment, as we have already
</p>
<p>shown.
</p>
<p>From 1666 to 1692, there was another inter-
</p>
<p>mission of Parliaments in Ireland.* It thus
</p>
<p>appears, that out of a period of a little more than
</p>
<p>a century, there were above seventy years in
</p>
<p>which no Parliament was held. If, however,
</p>
<p>regard be had to the mode in which the elections
</p>
<p>for the Lower House were conducted, as shall be
</p>
<p>shown presently ; to the kind of men who were
</p>
<p>returned ; and to the complexion of a large por-
</p>
<p>tion of the laws they enacted, the intermission
</p>
<p>can hardly be considered as an evil. But to be
</p>
<p>freed from the abomination of a corrupt legisla-
</p>
<p>ture, affords no proof of the non-existence of the
</p>
<p>enormous injustice resulting from the depriva-
</p>
<p>tion, for so long a period, of a fair and honest
</p>
<p>representation.
</p>
<p>II. Modes of the election of members of the House
</p>
<p>of Commons.
</p>
<p>On the original adjustment of representation
</p>
<p>in a legislative or deliberative body, it is fair to
</p>
<p>presume, on every principle of honour and ho-
</p>
<p>* u The fatal dissolution [took place] the 7th of August, 1666.
</p>
<p>This event was emphatically fatal, because it did not legally
</p>
<p>assemble, from this latter period, in Ireland, till 1692 " 244

<p>nesty, that there ought to be a reasonable pro-
</p>
<p>portion observed between the constituents and
</p>
<p>their representatives. If a town with three thou-
</p>
<p>sand inhabitants has two representatives, one
</p>
<p>with six thousand ought to have four. These
</p>
<p>proportions, however, will be materially changed
</p>
<p>by time. One place will rise into consequence
</p>
<p>from a state of obscurity, and another sink from
</p>
<p>a state of eminence to obscurity; and justice
</p>
<p>requires that the representation should be occa-
</p>
<p>sionally modified accordingly. But so many
</p>
<p>persons are interested in the support of abuses,
</p>
<p>and those who are thus interested act so much
</p>
<p>in concert, that reformation is at all times ex-
</p>
<p>tremely difficult : and we believe that in no coun-
</p>
<p>try but the United States, and perhaps France, in
</p>
<p>some of the scores of constitutions which "fretted
</p>
<p>their short hour on the stage," during the French
</p>
<p>revolution, has there ever been provision made
</p>
<p>for periodical regulation of representation by
</p>
<p>census. Hence the borough system in England
</p>
<p>has gradually become the scourge of that nation,
</p>
<p>and the astonishment and disgust of the rest of
</p>
<p>the world.
</p>
<p>But the representation in Ireland had, in its
</p>
<p>origin, all the leprosy and ulceration which time
</p>
<p>has introduced, in a succession of ages, into that
</p>
<p>of England. To expose its hideous deformity

</p>
<p>where I first drew my breath, and whose awful
</p>
<p>fate wrings my heart with distress, while I feebly
</p>
<p>sketch its wrongs, there was a systematic outrage
</p>
<p>on every principle of honour, honesty, and jus-
</p>
<p>tice, I shall give him a view of the mode in
</p>
<p>which the elections were managed in three Par-
</p>
<p>liaments : the two first in 1560 and 1568, under
</p>
<p>the " Virgin Queen," (lucus a non lucendo) and
</p>
<p>the third in 1613, under the wise, unassuming,
</p>
<p>profound, and thrice-puissant prince, James L the
</p>
<p>mirror and quintessence of perfection.
</p>
<p>In the first Parliament held under Elizabeth,
</p>
<p>the base means resorted to, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>securing a majority, were of a unique character,
</p>
<p>without previous precedent, or subsequent exam-
</p>
<p>ple. Writs were issued to only ten of the nine-
</p>
<p>teen counties then under the British government;
</p>
<p>and thus the remaining nine were disfranchised.
</p>
<p>The Parliament was composed of seventy-six
</p>
<p>members, of whom fifty-six were for towns
</p>
<p>and boroughs where the royal authority predo-
</p>
<p>minated :* the remaining twenty were for the

<p>* " In the House of Commons, we find representatives sum-
</p>
<p>moned for ten counties only. The rest, which made up the
</p>
<p>number seventy-six, were citizens and burgesses of those
</p>
<p>towns in which the royal authority was predominant. It is
</p>
<p>therefore little wonder, that, in spite of clamour and opposi-
</p>
<p>tion, in a session of a few weeks, the whole ecclesiastical sys-
</p>
<p>tem of queen Mary was entirely reversed by a series of sta-
</p>
<p>tutes, conformable to those already enacted in the English

</p>
<p>wholly unrepresented, and of course disfranchised.
</p>
<p>It was in this Parliament, and by such vile fraud,
</p>
<p>that the oppressive penal code against the Roman
</p>
<p>Catholics was enacted.
</p>
<p>On this atrocious affair, it would be superfluous

</p>
<p>In the Parliament held in 1568, the election
</p>
<p>was conducted with most manifest injustice. To
</p>
<p>pass over minor enormities, and condense the
</p>
<p>frauds into the narrowest compass possible, we
</p>
<p>shall confine ourselves to three species of flagrant
</p>
<p>crimes :
</p>
<p>I. Many persons were returned for places not
</p>
<p>incorporated, and which of course had no right
</p>
<p>to representation ;
</p>
<p>II. In several of the places entitled to send

<p>themselves ;

</p>
<p>which none of them were residents, although re-
</p>
<p>sidence was, by law, an essential requisite in a
</p>
<p>representative.
</p>
<p>In consequence of these frauds, the adminis-
</p>
<p>tration had a considerable majority ; and elected
</p>
<p>Mr. Stanihurst, recorder of Dublin, their speaker,
</p>
<p>although Sir Christopher Barnwell had a large
</p>
<p>majority of the votes of the real members, those
</p>
<p>who were duly elected. For a considerable time,
</p>
<p>the latter disputed the validity of the votes of
</p>
<p>the intruding impostors, which gave rise to the
</p>
<p>utmost disorder, and contests that would have
</p>
<p>better suited with a bear-garden than a Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment.* Hooker, one of the impudent intruders,
</p>
<p>has left on record the most circumstantial account
</p>
<p>of the affair that is to be found ; and, as the leader
</p>
<p>of the usurpers, endeavours to throw the whole
</p>
<p>guilt of the dishonourable proceeding on the
</p>
<p>members duly returned.! But it is impossible
</p>
<p>* " And in this matter they showed themselves very for-
</p>
<p>ward, and so unquiet that it was more like a bear-baiting of
</p>
<p>disorderly persons, than a Parliament of wise and grave
</p>
<p>men." 246
</p>
<p>" Their dealings then were altogether disordered, being
</p>
<p>more like a bear-baiting of loose persons, than an assembly of
</p>
<p>wise and grave men in parliament." 247

</p>
<p>met ; and, contrary to the order of that house, and duty of

<p>that company, instead of unity, there began a disunion ; and

</p>
<p>Tlie business of the legislature being impeded
</p>
<p>by these furious contests, it was agreed to refer
</p>
<p>the matter in dispute to the judges. This afforded
</p>
<p>but a miserable chance of redress for the Irish
</p>
<p>nation, as these functionaries were removable
</p>
<p>at the pleasure of the crown, and of course sub-
</p>
<p>servient to its views. However, the profligacy
</p>
<p>of the proceedings was fully established ; for the
</p>
<p>judges, corrupt and biassed as they were, admit-
</p>
<p>ted the existence of the three enormous species
</p>
<p>of offence alleged by the minority.* They de-
</p>
<p>cided that two of the classes of usurpers should
</p>
<p>be expelled the Parliament,
</p>
<p>I. Those who were returned for towns not
</p>
<p>incorporated ;
</p>
<p>II. Those magistrates who had returned them-
</p>
<p>selves.
</p>
<p>But they profligately gave their opinion, that
</p>
<p>those who were returned for towns where they
</p>
<p>* The judges, having " discoursed and conferred of this
</p>
<p>matter, returned their answers ; that concerning the first and
</p>
<p>second exceptions, that the burgesses returned from towns not
</p>
<p>corporate, and for such sheriffs, mayors, and sovereigns, as
</p>
<p>have returned themselves, shall be dismissed out of the same ;
</p>
<p>but as for such others as the sheriffs and mayors had return-
</p>
<p>ed, they should remain, and the penalty to rest upon the she-
</p>
<p>riff's for their -wrong returns"
</p>
<p>" The same was so stomached, that the placing of the Eng-
</p>
<p>lishmen, to be knights and burgesses, could not be digested,
</p>
<p>as did appear in the sequel of that assembly, where every bill
</p>
<p>furthered by the English gentlemen, was stopped and hindered
</p>
<p>by them." 250

<p>the penalty of the false, illegal returns should be

</p>
<p>The third class being more numerous than the
</p>
<p>other two, and being secured in their usurpa-

<p>tion by this iniquitous decision, the government
</p>
<p>still possessed a majority ; and was of course
</p>
<p>enabled to carry whatever measures it thought

</p>
<p>Englishmen, who probably had not an acre of

<p>increasing them.

<p>peace and security" would make the " swords of
</p>
<p>our citizens leap from their scabbards," to avail
</p>
<p>myself of the heroics of my countryman Burke.
</p>
<p>In the Parliament held anno 1613, under
</p>
<p>James T. the proceedings were at least as flagiti-
</p>
<p>ous. The whole number of boroughs represent-
</p>
<p>ed, previous to that period, was thirty ; but for
</p>
<p>this Parliament, in order to secure an overwhelm-
</p>
<p>ing majority, there were forty new boroughs
</p>
<p>created, every one. of them in places where the
</p>
<p>government had decided influence, and nearly the
</p>
<p>whole in shabby, contemptible hamlets,* which
</p>
<p>had not the least claim to a representation.! The
</p>
<p>chief part of these boroughs were incorporated
</p>
<p>previous to issuing the writs foi; the election;
</p>
<p>but with a most hardened and profligate disre-
</p>
<p>gard of even the forms of justice, many of them
</p>
<p>* "A number of new boroughs, most of them inconsiderable,
</p>
<p>and many of them too poor to afford wages to their representa-
</p>
<p>tives, must be entirely influenced by the government, and
</p>
<p>must return its immediate creatures and dependents. Such an
</p>
<p>accession of power could not fail to encourage the administra-
</p>
<p>tion to act without reserve, and pursue the dictates of its pas-
</p>
<p>sions and resentments." 351
</p>
<p>f The petition of the lords to king James, states the existence
</p>
<p>of " a fearful suspicion, that the project of erecting so many
</p>
<p>corporations in places that can scantly pass the rank of the
</p>
<p>poorest villages in the poorest country in Christendom, do tend
</p>
<p>to nought else, at this time, but that, by the voices of a few,
</p>
<p>selected for the purpose, extreme penal laws should be imposed
</p>
<p>upon your subjects here." 258

<p>were incorporated after the writs had been is-
</p>
<p>sued.* Sir John Davies feebly attempts to pal-
</p>
<p>liate this outrage on justice ;f but with pretty
</p>
<p>much the same success as attended his elaborate
</p>
<p>vindication of the Ulster spoliation.
</p>
<p>But, abandoned as was this system, it did not
</p>
<p>comprise one-half of the injustice or wickedness
</p>
<p>of the election. The same course was pursued
</p>
<p>as in the preceding Parliament. Many non-resi-
</p>
<p>dent Englishmen were returned ; some of the
</p>
<p>judges returned themselves ; and a number of
</p>
<p>wretched outlaws completed the list of the mem-
</p>
<p>bers of that House of Commons which attainted
</p>
<p>Tyrone and Tyrconnel.
</p>
<p>* " The deputy continued to increase the new boroughs to
</p>
<p>the number of forty y of which several were not incorporated,
</p>
<p>until the writs for summoning a Parliament had already
</p>
<p>Issued."**
</p>
<p>f " His majesty hath most graciously and justly created
</p>
<p>divers new boroughs, in sundry parts of the kingdom." 254
</p>
<p>" Certainly the number of these new boroughs, compared
</p>
<p>with the counties that never had any burgesses before this
</p>
<p>time, doth carry a less proportion than the ancient boroughs,
</p>
<p>compared with the number of the ancient counties ; for in
</p>
<p>those twelve or thirteen old shires, there are thirty cities and
</p>
<p>boroughs, at least, which send citizens and burgesses to the
</p>
<p>Parliament. Whereas, for seventeen counties at large, being
</p>
<p>more than half the shires of this kingdom, which had not one
</p>
<p>borough in them before this new erection, his majesty hath
</p>
<p>now lately erected BUT FORTY NEW BOROUGHS, or
</p>
<p>thereabouts, which, in the judgment of all indifferent men,
</p>
<p>must needs seem reasonable, just, and honourable." 255

</p>
<p>To heighten the wickedness of the proceed-
</p>
<p>ings, in imitation of the vile example set under
</p>
<p>the "Virgin Queen," no writs were issued to
</p>
<p>sundry ancient boroughs, which, from their popu-
</p>
<p>lation and cliarters, were entitled to representa-
</p>
<p>tives.*
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all these shameless and aban-
</p>
<p>doned frauds, the administration had not a large
</p>
<p>majority. Their usurping minions and parasites
</p>
<p>were only an hundred and twenty-five, and the
</p>
<p>opposition party were an hundred and one : there
</p>
<p>were six absent members, whose politics are
</p>
<p>not known.f It is easy to conceive what a de-
</p>
<p>cided majority the recusants would have had, but
</p>
<p>for the profligate disregard of every semblance of
</p>
<p>honour and justice, which, during the election,
</p>
<p>had governed the proceedings of the enemies of
</p>
<p>Irish happiness and prosperity.
</p>
<p>In consequence of those enormous abuses, the
</p>
<p>real representatives of the nation were out-num-
</p>
<p>bered ; and this motley majority forced Sir John
</p>
<p>* " It was asserted by them, in support of their opposition,
</p>
<p>that the sheriffs had sent no -writs to several of the boroughs ;
</p>
<p>thatyrom others, the returns -would not be received; that most
</p>
<p>of the patents and charters of the new boroughs were dated af-
</p>
<p>ter the commissions for the writs -were issued. 256
</p>
<p>f " Two hundred and thirty-two members had been re-
</p>
<p>turned : six were absent. Of the remainder, one hundred and

<p>twenty-five were Protestants ; and one hundred and one

</p>
<p>The real representatives of the people made a
</p>
<p>struggle as ardent, but as ineffectual, as had taken
</p>
<p>place in 1568. They were baffled by the address,
</p>
<p>overcome by the power, and compelled to yield
</p>
<p>to the wicked views, of a most profligate govern-
</p>
<p>ment : and the true state of the proceedings is
</p>
<p>recorded in the Journals, in the following resolu-
</p>
<p>tion, which is an open and undisguised confession
</p>
<p>of the infamy of the majority, and of the admi-
</p>
<p>nistration by whom they were supported :
</p>
<p>" Nov. 19, 1613, It was resolved by the house of commons,
</p>
<p>That whereas some persons have been unduly elected, some
</p>
<p>being judges, some for not being estated in their boroughs^
</p>
<p>some for being OUTLAWED, excommunicated; and lastly, for
</p>
<p>being returned for places -whose charters were not valid; it was
</p>
<p>resolved not to question them for the present, in order to pre-
</p>
<p>vent stopping public business ; but this resolution was not to
</p>
<p>be drawn into precedent." 258

<p>with insult and outrage. Two of them were,
</p>
<p>under some frivolous pretence, thrown into pri-

<p>bombastic speech from the royal pedant, full of

<p>verbiage that would have disgraced a school-boy.
</p>
<p>The discussion of such wickedness cannot fail
</p>
<p>to be to the last degree painful to the reader, as it
</p>
<p>is to the writer. It harasses and tears the feelings
</p>
<p>with violence. What a hideous prostitution of
</p>
<p>every thing honest, fair, just, or correct, it would
</p>
<p>be, were the governors of New York and Penn-
</p>
<p>sylvania, for the purpose of overwhelming the
</p>
<p>vote of the capitals of these two states, to incor-
</p>
<p>porate, in the one instance, Chesnuthill and Log-
</p>
<p>town, and, in the other, Bergen and Flatbush,
</p>
<p>and allow each of these places an equal number
</p>
<p>* " It seemed no auspicious incident to the Irish agents,
</p>
<p>that Talbot and Luttrel, for some late or present insolence of
</p>
<p>conduct, -were committed prisoners, one to the tower, the other
</p>
<p>to the fleet." 260
</p>
<p>f " In flagrant violation of the rights of the Irish Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, he referred the final determination of it to the English

<p>turns were illegal." 261

<p>drug, whose admixture transformed it into
</p>
<p>poison. To secure a majority in the Upper
</p>
<p>House, Irish titles were granted to English no-
</p>
<p>blemen, destitute of a single acre of land in Ire-
</p>
<p>land.* v They never appeared in Parliament ; but
</p>
<p>confided their proxies to the minions of the
</p>
<p>government, three, four, or five to one peer :
</p>
<p>" Twenty-nine proxies were entered^ four and five to one
</p>
<p>lord; which was a scheme of lord Strafford's. But this abuse
</p>
<p>was soon afterwards corrected, by a standing order, that rib
</p>
<p>more than two should be given to one lord." 263
</p>
<p>Thus six of these men of straw, not owning
</p>
<p>together a single farm, could out-vote the duke
</p>
<p>of Ormond, and the earls of Kildare, Castlehaven,

<p>were ready and adequate means of bringing

<p>On another occasion, a member of the House
</p>
<p>of Commons, who had a seat in the Privy Coun-
</p>
<p>cil, and who dared to vote against the dictum of
</p>
<p>the bashaw Wentworth, was punished by being
</p>
<p>expelled from the Council-Board. This whole-
</p>
<p>some and "apparent severity" was admirably
</p>
<p>calculated, in terrorem, for any other members
</p>
<p>who might venture to take the same course :
</p>
<p>Sir Piers Crosby, " in the second session of the late Par-
</p>
<p>liament, ventured to oppose some measures of administration.
</p>
<p>The deputy reprimanded and accused him of a violation of
</p>
<p>his oath, in voting against bills to which he had assented in
</p>
<p>Council, and concurred in transmitting them. Crosby was
</p>
<p>sequestered from the Council-Board. He complained of the
</p>
<p>severity, by petition. He desired license to repair to England.
</p>
<p>IT WAS REFUSED." 26 *
</p>
<p>The reader will probably be startled at the
</p>
<p>fact of the refusal of license to repair to England.
</p>
<p>But such was the real state of the case. No man
</p>
<p>in public employment could leave the kingdom,
</p>
<p>even to repair to the court of the British mo-
</p>
<p>narch, without license obtained from his deputy,

<p>which was never granted to characters obnoxious
</p>
<p>to him, who might seek an opportunity to expose
</p>
<p>his misdeeds.
</p>
<p>The case of Sir Piers is strong and striking.
</p>
<p>His standing in society was high ;,as he was a
</p>
<p>soldier of distinguished merit, and had acquired
</p>
<p>great reputation in the expedition to the coast of
</p>
<p>France, where he had been the principal means
</p>
<p>of preserving the English army in their retreat. 268
</p>
<p>His sole offence, as above stated, was voting
</p>
<p>against an act proposed by the Privy Council.
</p>
<p>If the merits of such a man could not secure him
</p>
<p>from the degradation inflicted merely for the
</p>
<p>independent discharge of his duty as a member
</p>
<p>of the legislature, it is easy to conceive the slavish
</p>
<p>and abject state in which those members were
</p>
<p>generally held, who had no such claims to atten-
</p>
<p>tion as belonged to the knight. His removal
</p>
<p>from the Privy Council Board took place by the
</p>
<p>express direction of the king, on the representa-
</p>
<p>tion of Wentworth.*
</p>
<p>This is a strong instance, in addition to those
</p>
<p>already given, of the fixed determination of the
</p>
<p>" royal martyr" to uphold his worthy representa-
</p>
<p>tive, in all his flagitious proceedings. He thereby
</p>
<p>rendered himself amenable, in the eye of the
</p>
<p>Eternal and Just God, for all the long course of

</p>
<p>Wentworth went to London, presented himself at

<p>court, and entered into a full detail of the whole
</p>
<p>course of conduct he had pursued. The unfeel-

<p>ing monarch expressed the most decided appro-

<p>bation :
</p>
<p>" His majesty interrupted me, and said this was no severi-
</p>
<p>ty ; wished me to go on in that way ; for if I served him
</p>
<p>otherways, I should not serve him as he expected from me.

<p>I had done ; and their lordships to advise I should go on in a

<p>the best service had been done this crown in Ireland. So I

<p>rose.' 1270
</p>
<p>The tyranny of the deputy, and the slavery of

<p>the legislature, were observable in every part of

<p>their proceedings. Not to exhaust the patience
</p>
<p>of the reader, we shall close with one more in-

</p>
<p>Understanding that tne members of that House
</p>
<p>contemplated choosing some other person, the
</p>
<p>insolent satrap was quite exasperated ; and des-
</p>
<p>patched the chancellor to them, with a mandate
</p>
<p>menacing his displeasure, if they should choose
</p>
<p>as speaker any other than the person "recom-

</p>
<p>at all events, would be utterly in vain, as " the

<p>conclusion must be according to his majesty's

<p>good will and pleasure."* His arbitrary power,
</p>
<p>imperious temper, and unrelenting disposition,
</p>
<p>were too well known, and the awe felt for him
</p>
<p>was too great, to admit of hesitation. His sove-
</p>
<p>reign will and pleasure were therefore as com-
</p>
<p>pletely the law in this instance, as the dictum of
</p>
<p>the emperor of Morocco in his capital.
</p>
<p>* " And as I understood there was a muttering among them

<p>of rejecting him, and choosing some other for themselves, I

<p>called the lord chancellor to me, and directed him to require

<p>them forthwith to assemble themselves in their house, and

<p>to choose their speaker, who was to be presented to me by

<p>nine o'clock the next morning ; telling them it was not -worth

<p>their contention, and that it would be taken as an ill presage

<p>of some waywardness or frowardness of mind, if they should

<p>go about to deny such for their speaker, as should be recom-

<p>V. Mode of framing laws.
</p>
<p>In this respect, as in every other in which we
</p>
<p>have viewed the case of unfortunate Ireland, her
</p>
<p>situation was to the last degree slavish, and the
</p>
<p>tyranny of England intolerable.
</p>
<p>In a venal and corrupt Parliament, packed in
</p>
<p>the same manner as those three Parliaments, held
</p>
<p>in the reigns of Elizabeth and James, which we
</p>
<p>have mentioned, Sir Edward Poynings, then de-
</p>
<p>puty, had a law passed which wholly destroyed
</p>
<p>the legislative power in, Ireland; reduced her
</p>
<p>Parliament nearly to a level with a bed of justice
</p>
<p>in France; limited its operations to the mere
</p>
<p>enregisterment or rejection of edicts ; and left
</p>
<p>it but a bare negative power of rejecting,* not
</p>
<p>of proposing, any law.f
</p>
<p>* " A set of statutes were enacted, in the 10th Henry
</p>
<p>VII. (Sir Edward Poynings being then lord deputy, from
</p>
<p>whence they were called Poynings' laws) which restrained the
</p>
<p>power, as well of the deputy, as of the Parliament : and in
</p>
<p>time there was nothing left to the Parliament of Ireland, but
</p>
<p>a bare negative, or power of rejecting, NOT OF PROPOS-
</p>
<p>ING, ANY LAW.' 1272
</p>
<p>f " This day [August 2, 1634] was remarkable for a dispute
</p>
<p>between the lords and the lord deputy, about the framing of
</p>
<p>acts ; which right, by Poynings' law, he contended, was in
</p>
<p>himself and the council only ; and Parliament had only poiver
</p>
<p>to prefer a petition to them for that purpose : and lord Straf-
</p>
<p>ford entered a memorable protest, upon this occasion, in the
</p>
<p>Journals." 273

<p>TYRANNY OF FREE GOVERNMENTS. 261
</p>
<p>By another law, passed during the administra-
</p>
<p>tion of the same satrap, all the laws previously
</p>
<p>existing in England, were, at one stroke, made
</p>
<p>of force within the kingdom of Ireland.*
</p>
<p>And, subsequently to this period, Ireland, with-
</p>
<p>out a single representative in the British Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, was always subject to the operation of all
</p>
<p>the British statutes, in which she " was specially
</p>
<p>named or included under general words." 274
</p>
<p>If the experience of the world did not afford
</p>
<p>numberless instances to prove, that those nations,
</p>
<p>which are the most jealous assertors of their own
</p>
<p>liberties, are the most consummate tyrants over
</p>
<p>subordinate nations, it would be matter of aston-
</p>
<p>ishment that England, which, at various periods
</p>
<p>of her history, had lavished so much blood and
</p>
<p>treasure, in defence of her own rights and free-
</p>
<p>dom, should have so uniformly violated every
</p>
<p>principle, not merely of liberty, but of justice, in
</p>
<p>her treatment of, and displayed such wanton
</p>
<p>tyranny towards, Ireland. The case of these
</p>
<p>two nations affords a most felicitous illustration
</p>
<p>of the judicious and profound remark of Hume,
</p>
<p>that it may be regarded as " a fixed maxim," that
</p>
<p>w though free governments have been commonly
</p>
<p>the most happy for those who partake of their
</p>
<p>* " It was enacted, by another of Poynings' laws, that all
</p>
<p>acts of Parliament, before that time made in Eingland, should
</p>
<p>be of force within the kingdom of Ireland.'" 275

<p>From Parliaments constituted in the manner
</p>
<p>we have detailed, few measures were to be hoped
</p>
<p>for, but what were fraught with destruction to
</p>
<p>the happiness of Ireland. Majorities were gene-
</p>
<p>rally secured in both houses, whose interests
</p>
<p>were in direct hostility with the best interests of
</p>
<p>the nation : and, in consequence, a large portion
</p>
<p>of their legislation has been an almost invariable

<p>tissue of outrage upon every principle of political
</p>
<p>economy, honour, honesty, and good faith.

<p>as EVERY ENGLISHMAN MIGHT OPPRESS, SPOIL, AND KILL

<p>THEM, WITHOUT CONTROUL, how was it possible they could

<p>be other than outlaws and enemies of the crown of ^England?
</p>
<p>If the king would not admit them to the condition of subjects,
</p>
<p>how could they learn to obey him as their sovereign ? When
</p>
<p>they might not converse or commerce with any civil man, nor
</p>
<p>enter into any town or city, without peril of their lives, whither
</p>
<p>should they fly but into the woods and mountains, and there

<p>live in a wild and barbarous manner ?' 1379

<p>made, no longer since than the 28th Henry VIII. that the

<p>English should not marry with any person of Irish blood,

<p>though he had gotten a charter of denization, unless he had
</p>
<p>done both homage and fealty to the king in the chancery, and

<p>We shall close with a short notice of the

</p>
<p>ground of its enaction, such miserable legends
</p>
<p>as display a disregard of even the slightest ap-
</p>
<p>pearance of common honesty. Their wicked-
</p>
<p>ness stares us in the face, with the most mere-
</p>
<p>tricious audacity. The act was passed by the
</p>
<p>Parliament held in the eleventh year of the
</p>
<p>reign of Elizabeth, which was called expressly for
</p>
<p>the purpose of attainting the person, and confis-
</p>
<p>cating the immense estate, of Shane O'Neal, who,
</p>
<p>as we have seen in page 179, was "rooted out,
</p>
<p>on the complaint of the nobility:" The preamble
</p>
<p>enters into an elaborate attempt to prove that
</p>
<p>the whole island, and all its inhabitants, were the
</p>
<p>property of the kings of England ! a most won-

<p>advance such claims, on the fabulous histories of

<p>offered would excite our merriment, did not
</p>
<p>profound astonishment at their injustice stifle the
</p>
<p>propensity to ridicule.
</p>
<p>The two principal grounds were, that the pro-
</p>
<p>genitors of the Irish, who migrated from Spain,
</p>
<p>lived in a province called Biscan, " whereof
</p>
<p>Bayon was a member ;" that king Gurmond, son
</p>
<p>to the noble king Belan, king of Great Britain,
</p>
<p>was lord of Bayon ; and, as the " Virgin Queen"
</p>
<p>was a lineal descendant of king Gurmond,
</p>
<p>" THEREFORE," most wonderful logic ! " the
</p>
<p>Irishmen should be the king of England his
</p>
<p>people, and Ireland his land !"
</p>
<p>But, not relying wholly on this strong title to
</p>
<p>the kingdom and the people, and lest there
</p>
<p>should be sceptics who would dare dispute the
</p>
<p>point, they adduce another proof, so powerful as
</p>
<p>to silence the controversy to the end of time.
</p>
<p>This corroboration rests on the incontrovertible
</p>
<p>fact, that as Heremon and Heberus were leading
</p>
<p>their followers from Spain, they met with the
</p>
<p>said renowned hero, king Gurmond, at the
</p>
<p>islands of the Orcades, which were then in the
</p>
<p>route from Spain to Ireland ; but they are now
</p>
<p>removed a few leagues out of the course. On
</p>
<p>this knotty point of geography, it is not necessary
</p>
<p>to dilate : we therefore return to the mighty mo-
</p>
<p>narch Gurmond.

<p>crowned with laurels, from a great victory ob-
</p>
<p>tained in Denmark. The Milesian chiefs, wearied
</p>
<p>out with their tedious pilgrimage, and panting
</p>
<p>after an asylum, where they might repose from
</p>
<p>their labours, made an humble supplication to
</p>
<p>the conqueror, to grant them some place to
</p>
<p>the west, wherein to settle themselves. This
</p>
<p>puissant prince, a mirror of humanity and be-
</p>
<p>nignity, had compassion on the wanderers ;
</p>
<p>most graciously made them a present of the
</p>
<p>Emerald Isle, with ah 1 its appurtenances ; and
</p>
<p>moreover kindly furnished guides, to direct them
</p>
<p>in their voyage thither. And therefore "they
</p>
<p>should and ought to be the king of England his
</p>
<p>men."
</p>
<p>The migration of the Milesians to Ireland, is
</p>
<p>stated by O'Connor, one of the most learned
</p>
<p>antiquarians of the last century, to have taken
</p>
<p>place eleven hundred years before the Christian
</p>
<p>era : the act for the attainder of O'Neale was
</p>
<p>passed in 1583. Thus the claim was quite a
</p>
<p>recent one, not quite twenty-seven hundred years
</p>
<p>old!
</p>
<p>The reader may perhaps imagine, that, to
</p>
<p>change the scene, we have taken a flight into the
</p>
<p>regions of fancy ; and that all we have stated,
</p>
<p>respecting Gurmond, and Belan, and Biscan, and

<p>A NEWLY-INVENTED GENERAL PARDON !
</p>
<p>A perusal of these passages, and of all the wri-
</p>
<p>ters we have ever examined on the subject, has
</p>
<p>led the world to give credit to James and his
</p>
<p>Irish Parliament for an exuberant stock of cle-
</p>
<p>mency. It has appeared that their motto, and
</p>
<p>the benignant rule of their conduct, had been
</p>
<p>Shakspeare's divine commendation of heaven-
</p>
<p>born mercy :
</p>
<p>" The quality of mercy," &c.
</p>
<p>It is supposed that this act of "general and
</p>
<p>free pardon" effaced all crimes and misdemeanors
</p>
<p>of every description ; was the harbinger of an
</p>
<p>universal jubilee throughout the kingdom ; and,
</p>
<p>from the hour of its promulgation, produced
</p>
<p>a general clearance of the prisons of all their
</p>
<p>tenants, by whatsoever tenure they had been held
</p>
<p>there. But, alas ! in Ireland, words bore an im-
</p>
<p>port different from what they had in any other
</p>
<p>country : and " an act of general pardon" in that
</p>
<p>ill-fated nation, was, in truth and in fact, an act of
</p>
<p>universal proscription : for in that Parliament and
</p>
<p>king, towards Ireland,
</p>
<p>" There was no more mercy, than milk in a male tiger." 293
</p>
<p>This assertion will appear ambiguous : but the
</p>
<p>ambiguity shall be soon removed. The act in
</p>
<p>question bears, it is true, in the Statute-Book,
</p>
<p>the fraudulent title of "an act for the king's

<p>CHAPTER XIV,
</p>
<p>The age of forgery, plots, and perjury.
</p>
<p>IN every age of the world, some peculiar folly
</p>
<p>or wickedness has prevailed, which distinguished
</p>
<p>it from those which preceded, as well as from
</p>
<p>those which followed, with nearly as much accu-
</p>
<p>racy as the varied features of the face distinguish
</p>
<p>one man from another.
</p>
<p>Were we called upon to fix the peculiar feature
</p>
<p>of the seventeenth century, in the wide range of
</p>
<p>the British dominions, we should, without hesita-
</p>
<p>tion, pronounce it to have been the age of for-
</p>
<p>gery, perjury, and fabricated plots, contrived for
</p>
<p>the purpose of overwhelming the innocent in
</p>
<p>ruin, and enriching malefactors with their spoils.'
</p>
<p>It is hardly credible, at the present day, when
</p>
<p>those dire passions that actuated so large a por-
</p>
<p>tion of the community in England and Ireland,
</p>
<p>during that period, have wholly subsided, and are
</p>
<p>now almost inconceivable, what a number of
</p>
<p>these contrivances were employed ; how regularly
</p>
<p>they succeeded each other ; what mischievous
</p>
<p>consequences they produced ; and yet how exces-
</p>
<p>sively stupid the most of them were. Many of
</p>
<p>them, which were devoured with greedy ears by

<p>the great and little vulgar, are so ridiculous, so
</p>
<p>absurd, and so utterly improbable, that, at the
</p>
<p>present day, they would not impose on a gang of
</p>
<p>swine-herds.
</p>
<p>Previous to entering into the examination and
</p>
<p>detection of the miserable pretended conspiracy
</p>
<p>of 1641, which led to scenes of horror, desola-
</p>
<p>tion, and massacre of the Irish, that chill the
</p>
<p>blood in the veins, we shall present the reader
</p>
<p>with a few facts, to satisfy him that the fabrication
</p>
<p>of pretended plots was a regular trade, pursued
</p>
<p>upon a most extensive scale ; was one of the
</p>
<p>levers by which the movements of the political
</p>
<p>machine were regulated ; and that consistency,
</p>
<p>coherence, probability, or even possibility, were
</p>
<p>not necessary to ensure its success.
</p>
<p>We have already established the efficacy of
</p>
<p>this infamous system, in producing confiscation
</p>
<p>in Ireland ; and how thousands were involved in
</p>
<p>ruin, and their posterity for ages consigned to
</p>
<p>poverty, by the dropping of a wretched catch-
</p>
<p>penny letter. We have shown, that after Tyrone,
</p>
<p>a nobleman of high grade and princely posses-
</p>
<p>sions among the Irish, had rendered important
</p>
<p>services to the state, and received a wound,
</p>
<p>fighting in its defence against his own country-
</p>
<p>men, he was almost immediately charged with
</p>
<p>a conspiracy, on grounds the most frivolous and
</p>
<p>contemptible, merely from the lust of spoliating
</p>
<p>his immense estate ; and that the same vile course

</p>
<p>was finally confiscated, after he was basely assas-
</p>
<p>sinated, at the instigation of the lord deputy, who
</p>
<p>publicly paid the assassin the price of his infamy,
</p>
<p>and thus stamped a brand of eternal infamy on
</p>
<p>his name, which all the cataracts of the Niagara
</p>
<p>could never efface.*
</p>
<p>The low herd of hardened wretches, who per-
</p>

</p>
<p>well as those of the higher orders, equally har-

</p>
<p>purpose,f felt no " compunctious visitings" of

</p>
<p>suffered no nausea at the immolation of hosts of
</p>
<p>innocent victims on the bloody altars of their
</p>
<p>ambition, their avarice, and their vengeance.

<p>Many of the instruments used on those occa-
</p>
<p>sions, were the basest and most wicked of ma'n-

<p>* " On a signal given, the soldiers rushed in ; butchered
</p>
<p>the wretched guests ; and buried their weapons in O'Neal.

<p>that the falsehood and perjury were manifest to

<p>the most cursory observer : but such was the

<p>general depravity and delusion of the times, and

<p>THE AGE OF PLOTS AND PERJURY. 293
</p>
<p>In those days, conspirators were accustomed,
</p>
<p>if we believe the depositions of some of the plot-
</p>
<p>contrivers, to stand in the open streets and high-
</p>
<p>ways, and converse about their conspiracies and
</p>
<p>treasons, as publicly and unreservedly as at pre-
</p>
<p>sent we convey to each other the intelligence of
</p>
<p>the price of stocks, the state of the weather, or
</p>
<p>any of those important nothings which form so
</p>
<p>large a portion of what is called conversation.
</p>
<p>This free and easy system was quite convenient
</p>
<p>to the informers, as it saved them much trouble
</p>
<p>in searching for evidence.
</p>
<p>On one occasion, the English House of Lords
</p>
<p>was alarmed by the important information given
</p>
<p>by an Italian, that he heard an Irishman, in the
</p>
<p>street, inform a certain Francisco, IN ITALIAN,
</p>
<p>that a plot was laid to kill some members of that
</p>
<p>House, particularly the earls of Northumberland,
</p>
<p>Essex, Holland, jc.* The House of Lords attach-
</p>
<p>* " Jan. 11, 1641-2. This day, one Francis Moor, an Italian,
</p>
<p>gave in an information to the House of Lords, That yesterday
</p>
<p>he stood talking with an Irishman, who lives with the lord
</p>
<p>viscount Loftus, in the street, and overheard ONE BRIAN
</p>
<p>KELLY, AN IRISHMAN, servant to the earl of Arundel, SPEAK
</p>
<p>IN ITALIAN [!] to one Signior Francisco, an Italian, and say,
</p>
<p>That there was a plot laid to kill some lords of the Parliament ;
</p>
<p>and in particular named the earl of Northumberland, the earl
</p>
<p>of Essex, the earl of Holland, the earl of Pembroke, and the
</p>
<p>earl of Leicester.

<p>Signior Francisco shall be forthwith apprehended, and attach-

<p>ed great importance to the affair, and summoned
</p>
<p>the parties to the bar : but it ended in smoke,
</p>
<p>after the purposes for which it had been fabri-
</p>
<p>cated were answered.
</p>
<p>The Irishman being so polite as to speak to
</p>
<p>his brother conspirator in Italian, it is highly
</p>
<p>probable that the latter, not to be outdone in
</p>
<p>politeness, replied in Gaelic or Irish. But, as the
</p>
<p>historian is silent on the subject, I would not be
</p>
<p>understood as committing myself, by any thing
</p>
<p>more than suggesting it as plausible, leaving it
</p>
<p>to the better judgment of the reader to decide.
</p>
<p>But, of all the informers of those days, a cer-
</p>
<p>tain Thomas Beal, a taylor, merited the palm.
</p>
<p>None of the confraternity could stand a compari-
</p>
<p>son with him. He gave minute details of a plot,
</p>
<p>in which one hundred and eight persons had
</p>
<p>engaged to murder as many members of Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment. The wages they were to receive for this
</p>
<p>pleasant and amusing business, were very mode-
</p>
<p>rate, particularly for the commons, who were
</p>
<p>not valued at more than twenty per cent, of the
</p>
<p>lords. The latter were to be paid for at the rate
</p>
<p>of ten pounds per man : but the poor members
</p>
<p>of the Lower House were valued at only forty
</p>
<p>shillings. The feats were to be performed as
</p>
<p>the members were coming down stairs from the
</p>
<p>denied that he ever spake any such words. Thereupon Moor
</p>
<p>was called in to confront him, and upon oath averred what he
</p>
<p>had formerly informed." 300

<p>* " House of Lords, Nov. 15, 1641. Thomas Beal, a
</p>
<p>taylor, dwelling in White-Cross street, was called in, and
</p>
<p>made a relation of the whole plot, with all the circumstances,
</p>
<p>which were as follows :
</p>
<p>" That this day, at twelve of the clock, he went into the
</p>
<p>fields, near the Pot-house : and walking over a private bank,
</p>
<p>he heard some talking, but did not see them at first ; but find-
</p>
<p>ing them by the voice, he coming within hearing of them, un-
</p>
<p>derstood they talked of state affairs : and going nearer them,
</p>
<p>he heard one of them say, that it was a wicked thing, that the
</p>
<p>last plot did not take ; but if this goes on, as is in hand and
</p>
<p>intended, they shall all be made. Heard them say, that there
</p>
<p>were an hundred and eight men appointed, to kill an hundred
</p>
<p>and eight members of the Parliament, every one his man ;
</p>
<p>some were lords, and others were to be members of the House
</p>
<p>of Commons, all Puritans ; and the sacrament was to be ad-
</p>
<p>ministered to the hundred and eight men, for performing of
</p>
<p>this ; and those that killed the lords were to have ten pounds,
</p>
<p>and those that killed the members of the House of Commons,
</p>
<p>forty shillings. That Gorges, being the thirty-seventh man,
</p>
<p>had taken the sacrament on Saturday, to kill one of the House
</p>

</p>
<p>the purpose of rendering themselves conspicuous,

</p>
<p>A plot for which Sir Henry Beddingfield was

<p>in Ireland with a thousand pounds, and a wand only in his

<p>was among the parties accused. 305 The details
</p>
<p>were of the most absurd and incredible character.
</p>
<p>On the trial, the principal evidence was one
</p>
<p>Dangerfield, a most profligate and worthless vil-
</p>
<p>lain.* There were sixteen records of convictions
</p>
<p>produced in court, to prove that he was not a
</p>
<p>competent witness. 306 He had been convicted of
</p>
<p>felony, had broken prison, been outlawed, brand-
</p>
<p>ed in the hand,f been four times convicted of
</p>
<p>forging the coin, once as a common cheat, been
</p>
<p>each time put in the pillory, and been guilty of
</p>
<p>almost every species of crime : but such was the
</p>
<p>abandoned character of the court, so completely
</p>
<p>* " The nation had gotten so much into the vein of credulity,
</p>
<p>and every necessitous villain was so much incited by the suc-
</p>
<p>cess of Oates and Bedlow, that even during the prorogation
</p>
<p>the people were not allowed to remain in tranquillity. There
</p>
<p>was one Dangerfield, a fellow who had been burned in the hand
</p>
<p>for crimes, transported, whipped, pilloried four times, fined
</p>
<p>for cheats, outlawed for felony, convicted of coining, exposed to
</p>
<p>all the public infamy which the laws could inflict on the basest
</p>
<p>and most shameful enormities. The credulity of the people,
</p>
<p>and the humour of the times, enabled even this man to be-
</p>
<p>come a person of consequence." 307
</p>
<p>f On this trial, a ludicrous opinion was given by the judges
</p>
<p>of the Common Pleas, who were consulted by lord Raymond,
</p>
<p>whether a pardon, which had been granted to Dangerfield,
</p>
<p>rendered his evidence admissible. " They say," states lord
</p>
<p>Raymond, " that if he had been convicted of felony, and not
</p>
<p>burnt in the hand, the pardon would not have set him upright :
</p>
<p>but being convicted and burnt in the hand, they suppose he is
</p>
<p>a witness." 30 *

<p>poisoned were the streams of justice, and so
</p>
<p>violent was the rage against the accused, that
</p>
<p>these solid objections were all over-ruled, and
</p>
<p>his evidence received as if he had been the most
</p>
<p>immaculate character in the nation.
</p>
<p>In a virulent and fabulous book, published
</p>
<p>under the title of "Memoirs of Ireland, from
</p>
<p>the Restoration to the present time," which con-
</p>
<p>tains almost as many lies as sentences, there is a
</p>
<p>curious account of one of those wonderful plots.
</p>
<p>It is quite an original ; and deserves to be brought
</p>
<p>to light once more, out of compliment to the
</p>
<p>talents of the fabricator who could devise, and
</p>
<p>to the sagacity of the stupid public which could
</p>
<p>digest, such a tale.
</p>
<p>It states, that a massacre of the Protestants in
</p>
<p>Ireland was intended, anno 1670 : preparatory to
</p>
<p>which, " the priests ordered their congregations
</p>
<p>at mass," to fix " over their doors a cross made of
</p>
<p>straw." This cross was to be a mark to the
</p>
<p>assassins not to molest the inhabitants, " when
</p>
<p>the bloody massacre was to be perpetrated." All
</p>
<p>" the men, women, and children" in the houses
</p>
<p>devoid of the straw cross,
</p>
<p>" God save the mark !"
</p>
<p>were " to be butchered, and the houses burned."
</p>
<p>This is very amusing, truly ; and a mere matter
</p>
<p>of course. But the enigmatical part of the plot
</p>
<p>remains. The crosses " were so little," that
</p>
<p>" the Protestants took no notice of them" by day-

</p>
<p>were to afford directions, were to be governed
</p>
<p>by them at night, as that time alone was fit for
</p>
<p>such deeds of blood. And, although the direc-
</p>
<p>tions had been given from the altar, throughout
</p>
<p>the kingdom, " the matter was carried with so
</p>
<p>much secrecy" that " the priests themselves"
</p>
<p>were ignorant of what was meant, and " believed
</p>
<p>that it was designed to bless the people's houses."
</p>
<p>And this miserable fabrication was credited ; ex-
</p>
<p>cited a vast deal of alarm among " the Protes-
</p>
<p>tant ascendency ;" and afforded a pretext for the
</p>
<p>further oppression and persecution of the, Roman
</p>
<p>Catholics :
</p>
<p>" The priests, by directions from their superiors, ordered
</p>
<p>their several congregations, at mass, that, at such a time, every
</p>
<p>Roman Catholic should fix over their doors A CROSS MADE
</p>
<p>OF STRAW. The people were curious to understand the rea-
</p>
<p>son of this order ; but the matter zvas carried with so much
</p>
<p>secrecy, that the priests themselves, it is believed, knew no
</p>
<p>more than that it was designed to bless the people's houses.
</p>
<p>This was generally performed : and, at the same time, vast
</p>
<p>multitudes of priests came from beyond sea ; who, as appears
</p>
<p>by the sequel, were better acquainted with the bottom of this
</p>
<p>black and damnable intrigue, than generally the poor ignorant
</p>
<p>priests of Ireland were, to whom the hellish conclave at Rome
</p>
<p>did not think fit to communicate a matter of this private and
</p>
<p>great importance. The plot was formed after the ensuing
</p>
<p>manner. This signal of the cross was to distinguish the Pa-
</p>
<p>fists from the Protestants, when THE BLOODY MASSA-
</p>
<p>CRE WAS TO BE PERPETRATED. Where no cross
</p>
<p>was found on the door, all within the house, men, women, and
</p>
<p>children, were to be butchered, on a certain day, and their houses
</p>
<p>burnt. Intimation of this design being given to the magis-

<p>most of the Papists 1 doors in the province of Munster. They
</p>
<p>were so little, that the Protestants took no notice of them.
</p>
<p>The priest, who discovered the plot first, ran away, and was
</p>
<p>no more heard of." 309
</p>
<p>The pretences of plots and conspiracies were
</p>
<p>constantly employed, throughout the century.*
</p>
<p>The public mind was kept in unceasing fermen-
</p>
<p>tation ;f which was excited to the highest degree,
</p>
<p>when any object of Irish oppression or degrada-
</p>
<p>tion was to be accomplished, and the excitement
</p>
<p>was always proportioned to the magnitude of that
</p>
<p>* "It was thought politic to have recourse to one [a sham plot]
</p>
<p>in the present exigence. For this purpose a committee was
</p>
<p>appointed to inquire into informations against the Irish, and
</p>
<p>the danger of the kingdom from them. Informations of one sort
</p>
<p>or other will never be wanting, when it is the interest of men
</p>
<p>in power to encourage them : and they are sure to be received
</p>
<p>with favour, and stv allowed without examination, however tri-
</p>
<p>fling, ridiculous, and improbable." 310
</p>
<p>f " They revived the rumours of new plots and conspiracies ;
</p>
<p>received informations of many dark designs and suspicious
</p>
<p>proceedings of the Irish ; alarmed the government with the
</p>
<p>danger of public commotions ; and, though all their industry
</p>
<p>could produce no material discoveries, yet it served their
</p>
<p>purpose of loading an obnoxious party with additional odium,
</p>
<p>at a time when they were to contend with them for estates
</p>
<p>and settlements." 311
</p>
<p>" Reports [were] spread by these agents and their creatures,
</p>
<p>as if the Irish Roman Catholics were ready to raise a new
</p>
<p>rebellion in that country. This was a thing impossible to be
</p>
<p>conceived by any body that knew the real state and miserable
</p>
<p>condition of those people at this time in Ireland." 312

<p>judice them in the opinion of the world, as well as of his ma-

</p>
<p>knew they were in no condition to rebel, nor was it likely they

<p>should attempt it at a time, when they were suing for grace

<p>and favour from his majesty. Sir M. Eustace, the lord chan-

<p>injustice, as well as the design of this charge against the Irish;

<p>and, to discover what ground there was for it, directed the
</p>
<p>judges in their circuits to cause the matter to be inquired into
</p>
<p>by the grand juries of the several counties through which they
</p>
<p>passed. The finding of those juries was alike in all places ;
</p>
<p>there being a great calm every -where, no preparation for a

<p>rising, nor so much as a rumour of any new troubles. Nothing
</p>
<p>could be more frivolous and void of proof, than the paper
</p>
<p>which the commons drew up on this subject." 313

</p>
<p>certain subjects of so odious or unpopular a nature, that few
</p>
<p>men dare, in public assemblies, offer to stem the torrent, and
</p>
<p>speak their minds about them with freedom. Of this nature
</p>
<p>was every motion, expressing a distrust of the Papists, and
</p>
<p>loading them with rebellious designs ; so that though the let-
</p>
<p>ters ivhich served as a foundation to their votes, rvere a mere
</p>
<p>contrivance and PALPABLE FORGERY, nobody (except the lord
</p>
<p>Strabane) seems to have expressed their dissatisfaction as to
</p>
<p>the proof and truth of them, or to have made any attempt to
</p>
<p>vindicate the Papists from a charge so weakly supported, and

<p>so very improbable in the present situation of the kingdom." 314

<p>In the year 1681, there was a wonderful alarm

<p>excited in England, on the subject of an intended

<p>insurrection and massacre in Ireland.* The most
</p>
<p>terrific accounts were transmitted from the latter
</p>
<p>to the former kingdom ; and warrants were issued
</p>
<p>for apprehending the supposed conspirators : but
</p>
<p>this, like so many other of the similar contri-
</p>
<p>vances, already noticed, manifested as much folly
</p>
<p>as fraud. The four leaders of this tremendous
</p>
<p>conspiracy, for whom those warrants were issued,
</p>
<p>were, Richard Talbot, lord Mountgarret and his
</p>
<p>son, and a colonel Peppard. 318 Talbot was appre-

<p>hended ; and, being examined, there was nothing

<p>Few sessions of the Irish Parliament took place,

<p>which were not marked by some of those pre-

<p>a letter, dated the third of December, 1688, sent to the earl of

<p>*' His lordship sent this letter to Dublin, with several co-
</p>
<p>pies of it ; and copies of it were also sent to all parts of the
</p>
<p>kingdom. It arrived at Dublin on Friday, and THE DAY
</p>
<p>OF SLAUGHTER WAS TO BE TWO DAYS AFTER;
</p>
<p>the terror of which was so great amongst the English, that
</p>
<p>about three thousand souls got away on the Saturday. There
</p>
<p>happened to be a great many ships in the harbour at that time,

<p>and they were all so crammed, that the passengers were in

<p>danger of being stifled." 326
</p>
<p>* " There was dropped in the streets a declaration of the

<p>Catholics of Ireland, framed upon presumption that the design

<p>that the English judiciary, although so extrava-
</p>

</p>
<p>state, so lost were the judges to every sense

<p>of honour and rectitude, and so sealed was the

<p>fate of the miserable men brought not to trial,

</p>
<p>Seven priests were indicted together at the
</p>
<p>Old Bailey, in the year 1679, for treason, in
</p>
<p>exercising their sacerdotal functions in England,
</p>
<p>contrary to the statute, which declared this a
</p>
<p>capital offence. The principal evidence against
</p>
<p>them was one Bedlow, who was, according to
</p>
<p>the testimony of Hume, 330 a nefarious villain,
</p>
<p>of the most blasted character, whose evidence
</p>
<p>should not have been taken against a notorious
</p>
<p>felon. On the trial of L. Anderson, the first of
</p>
<p>the number, Bedlow was detected, in open court,
</p>
<p>in a most manifest and flagrant perjury. He had
</p>
<p>sworn that Anderson was the son of a gentleman
</p>
<p>in Oxfordshire, and that HE KNEW HIM AND
</p>
<p>HIS FATHER WELL. The lord chief baron,
</p>
<p>who happened to be then in court, was acquaint-
</p>
<p>ed with the accused, who immediately appealed
</p>
<p>to him, to prove that he was the son of a gentle-
</p>
<p>man in Lincolnshire; which the baron accordingly
</p>
<p>testified. The case-hardened Bedlow, no ways
</p>
<p>abashed, stated that he had his information, as to
</p>
<p>the place of Anderson's birth, FROM MY LORD
</p>
<p>PRIVY-SEAL'S NEPHEW ; notwithstanding the atro-
</p>
<p>cious villain had, a few minutes before, positively
</p>
<p>sworn that he knew him well.*

<p>This manifest perjury, for which, had not the

</p>
<p>er, Bedlow ought to have been immediately in-

</p>
<p>tunate men, who were all found guilty, on the

<p>Who can read this statement without horror ?
</p>
<p>Who can regard otherwise than as a mere
</p>
<p>slaughter-house, a court of justice, where, on
</p>
<p>the trial of a number of men for their lives;
</p>
<p>merely for the worship of the Living God, the
</p>
<p>judge acts the part of the public accuser ;* where
</p>
<p>the witnesses for the accused are almost torn
</p>
<p>to pieces by the mob ;f and where the evidence
</p>
<p>is unhesitatingly received, of a wretch whose
</p>
<p>perjury is as clear as the noon-day sun ; who is
</p>
<p>caught flagrante delicto ; and whose confession
</p>
<p>of the hideous crime is made in open court,
</p>
<p>a wretch on whom
</p>
<p>" Sin, death, and hell had set their marks." 332
</p>
<p>The reader may inquire, why these facts are
</p>
<p>here adduced, as few of them occurred in Ireland,
</p>
<p>* " The chief justice gave sanction to all the narrow pre-
</p>
<p>judices and bigoted fury of the populace. Instead of being
</p>
<p>counsel for the prisoners, as his office required, HE PLEADED
</p>
<p>THE CAUSE AGAINST THEM; browbeat their witnesses; and
</p>
<p>on every occasion represented their guilt as certain and uncon-
</p>
<p>troverted." 333
</p>
<p>| " When verdict was given against the prisoner, the spec-
</p>
<p>tators expressed their savage joy, by loud acclamations. The
</p>
<p>witnesses, on approaching the court, were almost torn in pieces
</p>
<p>by the rabble. One, in particular, was bruised to such a de-
</p>
<p>gree as to put his life in danger : and another, a woman, de-
</p>
<p>clared that, unless the court could afford her protection, she
</p>
<p>durst not give evidence. But as the judges could" [would,
</p>
<p>more properly] " go no farther than promise to punish such as
</p>
<p>should do her any injury, the prisoner himself had the huma-
</p>
<p>nity to wave her testimony." 334

<p>CHAPTER XV.
</p>
<p>The insurrection in 1641. Was there a general
</p>
<p>conspiracy of the Irish, in that year, to murder
</p>
<p>the Protestants ?
</p>
<p>THE decision of this question is attended with
</p>
<p>far more difficulty than any of those which we
</p>
<p>have heretofore presented to the view of the
</p>
<p>reader. The nature of the case does not admit
</p>
<p>of the same kind of evidence as we have been
</p>
<p>enabled to produce, and which, we flatter our-
</p>
<p>selves, has been found irresistible.
</p>
<p>But the tale of this conspiracy has been so
</p>
<p>universally credited ; so large a portion of the
</p>
<p>possessors of confiscated property in Ireland
</p>
<p>have been interested in affording it support and
</p>
<p>countenance ; so much art and talent have been,
</p>
<p>for a hundred and seventy years, employed in
</p>
<p>giving it an air of plausibility ; there is so much
</p>
<p>difficulty in proving a negative in any case, more
</p>
<p>particularly in the present one, which is natural-
</p>
<p>ly, and has been moreover artfully, involved in
</p>
<p>mystery ; and it is so extremely arduous an un-
</p>
<p>dertaking, to operate upon the public mind,
</p>
<p>when imbued with inveterate prejudices, that we
</p>
<p>regard the task as Herculean, and should have

<p>abandoned it as impracticable, but that the nar-
</p>
<p>rative itself is replete with so many incredible
</p>
<p>and incongruous circumstances, as to carry strong
</p>
<p>internal evidence of fraud.
</p>
<p>In order to give the story fair play, and to
</p>
<p>enable the reader to form a correct opinion on
</p>
<p>the subject, with all the evidence before him, we
</p>
<p>shall give the whole account of the discovery of
</p>
<p>the plot, as it stands in Temple's History of the
</p>
<p>Irish Rebellion, the authority almost solely re-
</p>
<p>lied on by all the other writers on the subject.
</p>
<p>We add some slight extracts from Borlase, con-
</p>
<p>taining a few additional particulars.
</p>
<p>To simplify the examination, we have divided
</p>
<p>the whole into short sentences, each containing
</p>
<p>perfect sense, so as to oblige the reader to pause
</p>
<p>and reflect, as he proceeds.
</p>
<p>This point being the main one we have in
</p>
<p>view in this work, we earnestly invoke the read-
</p>
<p>er's calm and candid consideration of it. We
</p>
<p>hope that, laying aside all preconceived opinions
</p>
<p>on the subject, he will revolve it in his mind, as
</p>
<p>if it were wholly new, and he had now, for the
</p>
<p>first time in his life, to form a decision on it.
</p>
<p>We are aware that there are too many to whom
</p>
<p>a compliance with this request is impossible : and
</p>
<p>indeed a large proportion of mankind can never
</p>
<p>command independence of mind enough even to
</p>
<p>examine the evidence that militates with their
</p>
<p>early, and, of course, inveterate, prejudices ; far

</p>
<p>soon doubt any of the demonstrations of Euclid,
</p>
<p>or the existence of the solar system, as the ex-
</p>
<p>istence of the universality of the plot of " the
</p>
<p>execrable rebellion of 1641."
</p>
<p>To this contracted class we do not address
</p>
<p>ourselves : with them we have no fellowship :
</p>
<p>" Even though one were to rise from the dead,"
</p>
<p>he would not remove their incredulity. Let them
</p>
<p>hug the chains of their bigoted prejudice. We
</p>
<p>appeal to that respectable description of readers,
</p>
<p>whose minds are open to conviction, and who
</p>
<p>are at all times ready to yield to the force of
</p>
<p>evidence, how strongly soever it may militate
</p>
<p>against those opinions that have " grown with

<p>their growth." The favourable decision of one

</p>
<p>several journies into the Pale and other places, and had spent
</p>
<p>his time much in writing letters and sending despatches abroad.
</p>
<p>4. " These letters were received by the lords justices and

<p>council ;
</p>
<p>5. " And they, in answer to them, required him to be very

<p>thereof, or of any other particular that he conceived might

<p>1. " They [the lords justices] had not any certain notice of
</p>
<p>the general conspiracy of the Irish, until the 22d of October,
</p>
<p>in the very evening before the day appointed for the surprise
</p>
<p>of the castle of Dublin.

<p>2. " The conspirators being, many of them, arrived within

<p>the city, and having that day met at the Lion tavern, in Cop-

<p>per alley, and there turning the drawer out of the room, order-

<p>ed up in the true Protestant religion, came unto the lord jus-

<p>for the seizing upon his majesty's castle of DuBlin.

<p>town for the same purpose, and that next morning they would
</p>
<p>undoubtedly attempt, and surely effect it, if their design were
</p>
<p>not speedily prevented ;

<p>8. " In regard it came from an obscure person, and one, aa
</p>
<p>he conceived, somewhat distempered at that time.
</p>
<p>9. " But howsoever, the lord Parsons gave him order to go
</p>
<p>again to Mac-Mahonl ! ! and get out of him as much certainty
</p>
<p>of the plot! !! with as many particular circumstances, as he
</p>
<p>could ! ! ! straitly charging him to return back unto him the
</p>
<p>same evening ! ! !
</p>
<p>10. " And in the mean time, having by strict commands giv-
</p>
<p>en to the constable of the castle, taken order to have the gates
</p>
<p>thereof well guarded, as also with the mayor and sheriff's of the
</p>
<p>city to have strong watches set upon all parts of the same, and
</p>
<p>to make stay of all strangers,
</p>
<p>11. " He went privately ! ! about ten of the dock that night,
</p>
<p>to the lord Borlace's house without the town, and there ac-
</p>
<p>quainted him with what he understood from O'Conally.
</p>
<p>12. " They sent for such of the council as they knew then to
</p>
<p>be in the town.
</p>
<p>13. " But there came only unto them that night sir Thomas
</p>
<p>Rotheram and sir Robert Meredith, chancellour of the exche-

<p>quer : with these they fell into consultation what was fit to be
</p>
<p>done! ! ! ! attending the return of O'Conally.
</p>
<p>14. " And finding that he staid somewhat longer than the
</p>
<p>time prefixed, they sent out in search after him ;

<p>been carried away to prison, and the discovery that night dis-

<p>appointed,

</p>
<p>1. " That he being at Monimore, in the county of London-

<p>derry on Tuesday last! he received a letter from colonel Hugh

<p>Oge Mac-Mahon, desiring him to come to Conaught, in the
</p>
<p>county of Monaghan, and to be with him on Wednesday or
</p>
<p>Thursday last !
</p>
<p>2. " Whereupon he, this examinate, came to Conaught, on

<p>Wednesday night last ;
</p>
<p>3. " And finding the said Hugh come to Dublin, followed
</p>
<p>him hither ;
</p>
<p>4. " He came hither about six of the clock this evening- !
</p>
<p>5. " And forthwith went to the lodging of the said Hugh,
</p>
<p>to the house near the Boat, in Oxmantown ;
</p>
<p>6. " And there he found the same Hugh, and came with the
</p>
<p>said Hugh into the town, near the Pillory, to the lodging of
</p>
<p>the lord Macguire ;
</p>
<p>7. " Where they found not the lord within ; and there they
</p>
<p>drank a cup of beer ;
</p>
<p>8. " And then went back again to the said Hugh his lodging;
</p>
<p>9. " He saith, that at the lord Macguire his lodging, the
</p>
<p>said Hugh told him that there were and would be this night
</p>
<p>great numbers of noblemen, and gentlemen of the Irish Pa-
</p>
<p>pists, from all the parts of the kingdom, in this town;
</p>
<p>10. " Who with himself had determined to take the castle
</p>
<p>of Dublin, and possess themselves of all his majesty's ammu-
</p>
<p>nition there, to-morrow morning, being Saturday ;
</p>
<p>11. "And that they intended first to batter the chimnies of

<p>the said town : and if the city would not yield, then to batter

<p>down the houses ;

</p>
<p>that the Irish had prepared men in all parts of the kingdom,
</p>
<p>to destroy all the English inhabiting there, to-morrow morn-
</p>
<p>ing, by ten of the clock ! 1
</p>
<p>14. " And that in all the sea-ports, and other towns in the
</p>
<p>kingdom, all the Protestants should be killed this night! ! and
</p>
<p>that all the posts that could be, could not prevent it ;
</p>
<p>15. " And further saith, that he moved the said Hugh to
</p>
<p>forbear executing of that business, and to discover it to the
</p>
<p>state, for the saving of his own estate ;
</p>
<p>16. " Who said he could not help it ; but said, that they did
</p>
<p>owe their allegiance to the king, and would pay him all his
</p>
<p>rights : but that they did this for the tyrannical government
</p>
<p>was over them, and to imitate Scotland, who got a privilege
</p>
<p>by that course ;
</p>
<p>17. " And he further saith, that when he was with the said
</p>
<p>Hugh, in his lodging the second time, the said Hugh swore,
</p>
<p>that he should not go out of his lodging that night, but told
</p>
<p>him that he should go with him the next morning to the castle :
</p>
<p>and said, if this matter were discovered, some body should
</p>
<p>die for it ;
</p>
<p>18. " Whereupon this examinate feigned some necessity for
</p>
<p>his easement, went down out of the chamber, and left his sword
</p>
<p>in pawn : and the said Hugh sent his man down with him,
</p>
<p>and when this examinate came down into the yard, and finding
</p>
<p>an opportunity, he, this examinate, leaped over a -wall and two

<p>4. " The plot was on the then next morning, Saturday, the
</p>
<p>23d of October, being St. Ignatius's day, about nine of the clock!
</p>
<p>to surprize his majestie's castle of Dublin, his majestie's chief
</p>
<p>strength of this kingdom ; wherein also is the principal maga-
</p>
<p>zine of his majestie's arms and munition.
</p>
<p>5. " And it was agreed, it seems, among them, that at
</p>
<p>the same hour, all other his majestie's forts and magazines of
</p>
<p>arms and munition in this kingdom ! ! should be surprized by
</p>
<p>others of those conspirators :
</p>
<p>6. " And further, that all the Protestants and English
</p>
<p>throughout the -whole kingdom, that would not join with them,
</p>
<p>should be cut off! ! and so those Papists should then become
</p>
<p>possessed of the government and kingdom at the same instant.
</p>
<p>7. " As soon as I had that intelligence, I then immediately
</p>
<p>repaired to the lord justice Borlace ; and thereupon -we in-
</p>
<p>stantly assembled the council.
</p>
<p>8. "And having sate all that night!!! also all the next
</p>
<p>day, the 23d of October, in regard of the short time left us for
</p>
<p>the consultation of so great and weighty a matter, although it
</p>
<p>was not possible for us, upon so few hours' warning, to pre-

<p>vent those other great mischiefs which were to be acted, even
</p>
<p>at the same hour and at so great a distance, in all the other

<p>parts of the kingdom.

<p>castle to be that night strengthened with armed men, and the

<p>city guarded, as the wicked councils of those evil persons, by

<p>the great mercy of God to us, became defeated, so as they

<p>were not able to act that part of their treachery, which indeed

<p>was principal,

</p>
<p>rendered the rest of their purposes the more easy.

<p>good fortune in the county of Monaghan, who, with others,

<p>WAS TAKEN THAT MORNING in Dublin, having, at

<p>their swords drawn ; but finding those we employed against

<p>them more in number, and better armed, yielded.
</p>
<p>13. " He, upon examination before us, at first denied all; but
</p>
<p>in the end, when he saw we laid it home to him, he confessed

<p>enough to destroy himself, and impeach some others, as by a

<p>copy of his examinations herewith sent, may appear to your

<p>lordship.

<p>time to examine him again, our time being become more need-

<p>ful to be employed in action for securing this place, than

<p>ANALYSIS OF THE FOREGOING LEGEND.
</p>
<p>I. A Roman Catholic colonel is engaged in a
</p>
<p>plot, the object of which is to massacre all the
</p>
<p>Protestants in the kingdom, except those who
</p>
<p>would join in murdering their brethren.
</p>
<p>II. This colonel, in want of a confederate,
</p>
<p>sends about fifty miles to O'Conally, a Protestant,
</p>
<p>to reveal to him this project.
</p>
<p>III. O'Conally, who, in order to attach impor-
</p>
<p>tance to his testimony, in some of the statements
</p>
<p>is styled " a gentleman," is, in fact and in truth,
</p>
<p>merely a servant to Sir John Clotworthy, one of
</p>
<p>the most envenomed enemies of the Roman Ca-
</p>
<p>tholics, and, of course, a very suitable person to
</p>
<p>be entrusted with such a secret, and very worthy

<p>IV. O'Conally receives the letter on Tuesday,
</p>
<p>the 19th of October, at what hour is not known,
</p>
<p>say nine o'clock ; and, wholly ignorant of the
</p>
<p>nature of the affair which leads to the invitation,

<p>makes all his preparations at once, and com-
</p>
<p>mences his journey, we will suppose, about noon

<p>V. He arrives, on Wednesday night, the 20th,
</p>
<p>at Conaught, after a journey of about fifty miles :
</p>
<p>and be it observed, en passant, that a journey of
</p>
<p>fifty miles, at that period, was as arduous an
</p>

<p>VI. Colonel Mac-Mahon, who had given him
</p>
<p>the option of coming on Wednesday OR Thurs-
</p>
<p>day, so far broke his engagement, that he had
</p>
<p>started, on Wednesday, for Dublin, previous to
</p>
<p>O'Conally's arrival, which took place on the
</p>
<p>night of that day.
</p>
<p>VII. O'Conally, nothing discouraged by the
</p>
<p>breach of engagement on the part of the colonel,
</p>
<p>follows him to Dublin.
</p>
<p>VIII. He arrives in that city on the memorable
</p>
<p>Friday, the 22d of October, at six o'clock in the
</p>
<p>evening, ONE HOUR AFTER SUNSET.
</p>
<p>IX. Monimore, where O'Conally received the
</p>
<p>friendly invitation to the throat-cutting party,
</p>
<p>appears, by Pinkerton's map, to be about ninety-
</p>
<p>three miles in a direct line from Dublin, and
</p>
<p>was probably a hundred and ten, or a hundred
</p>
<p>and twenty, by the usual circuitous windings of
</p>
<p>the road, we will suppose only a hundred and
</p>
<p>ten.
</p>
<p>X. Conaught, in Monaghan, is not to be found
</p>
<p>on any map. Its distance from the extreme
</p>
<p>points cannot therefore be ascertained ; and, be-
</p>
<p>ing left to range in the fields of conjecture, we
</p>
<p>will venture to suppose it was nearly mid-way,
</p>
<p>or fifty miles.
</p>
<p>XI. The climate of Ireland is very moist. Rains
</p>
<p>are generally abundant, particularly in autumn.
</p>
<p>Of course, the roads at that season were very
</p>
<p>probably mini, and difficult to travel.

<p>XII. It thus appears, that O'Conally has per-
</p>
<p>formed a journey of about fifty miles in a day
</p>
<p>and a half; that is, from mid-day on Tuesday,
</p>
<p>to Wednesday night ; and a hundred and ten in
</p>
<p>three days and a half, at a season of the year,
</p>
<p>when THE SUN ROSE ABOUT SEVEN, AND SET
</p>
<p>ABOUT FIVE ; and this exploit was accomplished
</p>
<p>at a time when there were no diligences, or
</p>
<p>post-coaches, or post-chaises, or steam-boats, to
</p>
<p>ensure expedition; and when, moreover, the
</p>
<p>roads were, as we have stated, in all probability
</p>
<p>in very bad order.
</p>
<p>XIII. Nothing discouraged by the fatigue of his
</p>
<p>journey of a hundred and ten miles, nor by his
</p>
<p>previous disappointment, nor by the darkness of
</p>
<p>the evening, he commences a search for the
</p>
<p>lodgings of an entire stranger. And let it not be
</p>
<p>forgotten, that on this night the moon was invi-
</p>
<p>sible,* a circumstance admirably calculated to aid
</p>
<p>his researches !

<p>XIV. Instinct is a most valuable quality, and
</p>
<p>supplies the want of the most important senses :
</p>
<p>and the "servant" or "gentleman" aided by
</p>
<p>instinct, discovered, in the suburbs, the lodgings
</p>
<p>of the colonel; as Sir John Falstaff, " by instinct"
</p>
<p>discovered the mad-cap prince of Wales.
</p>
<p>XV. Although the colonel was engaged in " a
</p>
<p>good plot, and full of expectation," to explode
</p>
<p>on Saturday, at ten o'clock, A. M. O'Conally finds
</p>
<p>him alone at or about six o'clock on Friday even-
</p>
<p>ing, in the suburbs, and appears to have seen
</p>
<p>none of his brother conspirators until nine, at
</p>
<p>which time O'Conally left him.
</p>
<p>XVI. The colonel takes him to the lodgings of
</p>
<p>a brother conspirator " into town" at the distance,
</p>
<p>probably, of a mile or two.
</p>
<p>XVII. This conspirator not being at home, the
</p>
<p>colonel, after having taken a drink of beer with
</p>
<p>his new friend, freely communicates " that there
</p>
<p>were and would be, this night, great numbers of
</p>
<p>noblemen and gentlemen of the Irish, from all
</p>
<p>parts of the kingdom," whose object was " to cut
</p>
<p>off all the Protestants that would not join them" 3 * 4 '
</p>
<p>XVIII. And they then went back to " the said
</p>
<p>Hugh his lodgings," in the suburbs, "near Ox-
</p>
<p>mantown," where O'Conally drank himself beastly
</p>
<p>drunk.

</p>
<p>he was, two hours afterwards, unable to relate a
</p>
<p>consistent story, was alert enough to " leap over
</p>
<p>a wall," and afterwards " over two pales," which
</p>
<p>was a very remarkable exploit, for a man who
</p>
<p>had poured out so many libations to Bacchus.
</p>
<p>" I have seen drunkards do more than this in sport." 34 *
</p>
<p>XX. He found his way, " by instinct," probably,
</p>
<p>to Sir William Parsons, into the town, to whom
</p>
<p>he communicated the whole affair.
</p>
<p>XXI. Here let us observe, by way of a paren-
</p>
<p>thesis, that this very Sir William had received
</p>
<p>information of a plot, several days before, from
</p>
<p>Sir William Cole, "upon the very first apprehen-
</p>
<p>sion of something that he conceived to be hatching
</p>
<p>among the Irish." 346
</p>
<p>XXII. And further, that this lord justice had
</p>
<p>written to Sir William Cole, " to be very vigilant
</p>
<p>in inquiring into the occasion of those meet-
</p>
<p>ings ;" 347 whereby it appears that he had suspi-
</p>
<p>cions of a conspiracy.
</p>
<p>XXIII. Notwithstanding this information, Sir
</p>
<p>William Parsons, who was jealous of some plot
</p>
<p>"hatching among the Irish;" who, of course,
</p>
<p>ought to be on the qui vive, and to take alarm
</p>
<p>on the slightest intimation of any scheme of that
</p>
<p>kind ; receiving this " broken relation of a matter
</p>
<p>so incredible in itself," his lordship "gave very
</p>
<p>little belief to it at first, in regard it came from
</p>
<p>an obscure person, and one, as he conceived,
</p>
<p>somewhat distempered at that time." 348

<p>XXIV. " His lordship," with most wonderful
</p>
<p>sagacity, " hearing this broken relation" of a plot,
</p>
<p>to explode in about twelve or thirteen hours, for
</p>
<p>the purpose of cutting the throats of all the Pro-
</p>
<p>testants, and his own very valuable throat among
</p>
<p>the rest, sends the informer ! ! between nine and
</p>
<p>ten at night ! ! with " order to go again to Mac-
</p>
<p>Mahon, and get out of him as much certainty of
</p>
<p>the plot as he could ! ! !" 349
</p>
<p>XXV. This informer, being so drunk, as we
</p>
<p>have stated, that, in an hour or two afterwards,
</p>
<p>he was unable to make a deposition, without let-
</p>
<p>ting " sleep, with her leaden and batty wings,
</p>
<p>creep over him," was therefore a most admirable
</p>
<p>spy to make further discoveries! !!
</p>
<p>XXVI. After sending O'Conally to Mac-Mahon's
</p>
<p>lodgings, with strict orders w to return back unto
</p>
<p>him the same evening," Sir William went "pri-
</p>
<p>vately, at about ten of the clock that night, to

</p>
<p>whereas O'Conally was directed to come to him

<p>at his house WITHIN THE TOWN.

</p>
<p>they knew then to be IN THE TOWN," to lord

<p>found that he had been taken by the watch, and

<p>rescued by the servants of Sir William Parsons,

<p>XXX. " Sensible that his discovery was not

<p>thoroughly believed, he professed that whatever

<p>he had acquainted the lord Parsons with, was

<p>true ; and could he but repose himself, (the ef-
</p>

<p>of a bed." 355

<p>required the most decisive measures of preven-
</p>
<p>tion, it becomes a serious question, what did the

<p>lords justices do ? On this point the whole merits

<p>catety set upon the lodgings of Mac-Mahon, as

<p>also upon the lord Macguire !!!"
</p>
<p>XXXVI. In a plain, simple case, in which a
</p>
<p>school-boy of ten years old- could have at once
</p>
<p>pointed out the course to be pursued, they spend
</p>
<p>no less than five precious hours " in consultation"
</p>
<p>and in devising ways and means for the public
</p>
<p>safety, notwithstanding that the sword, not of
</p>
<p>Damocles, but of Mac-Mahon and his bloody-
</p>
<p>minded associates, hung over them. " They sate
</p>
<p>up all that night in consultation," "having far
</p>
<p>stronger presumptions, upon the latter examina-
</p>
<p>tion taken, than any ways at first they could
</p>
<p>entertain." 356
</p>
<p>XXXVII. The result of their long and painful
</p>
<p>consultation, from twelve o'clock at night till five
</p>
<p>in the morning, was, that at that late hour, they
</p>
<p>at length adopted the resolution of apprehending
</p>
<p>Mac-Mahon ! ! ! ! ! !
</p>
<p>XXXVIII. The lords justices had received the
</p>
<p>names of some of the principal conspirators from
</p>
<p>O'Conally, and, among the rest, of lord Macguire;
</p>
<p>had privately set a watch, on Friday night, at his
</p>
<p>lodgings : they must of course have known that
</p>
<p>he was equally implicated with Mac-Mahon, and
</p>
<p>equally demanded the exercise of their vigilance ;
</p>
<p>and yet they did not think of arresting him, until

<p>after the seizure of the latter, and " a conference

<p>received the week before from Sir William Cole"
</p>
<p>they " gathered" that he " was to be an actor in
</p>
<p>surprising the castle of Dublin." 357
</p>
<p>XXXIX. Owen O'Conally swears, that in all
</p>
<p>parts of the kingdom, " all the English inhabit-
</p>
<p>ing there," are to be destroyed " to-morrow
</p>
<p>morning " but, in the very next sentence, he
</p>
<p>swears, " that all the Protestants, in all the sea-
</p>
<p>ports and other towns in the kingdom, should be
</p>
<p>killed this night" It is not easy to conceive,
</p>
<p>how, after they were "all killed'" on Friday night,
</p>
<p>they could be " all destroyed" on Saturday morn-
</p>
<p>ing.
</p>
<p>XL. O'Conally's deposition states, that the
</p>
<p>massacre is to begin at ten o'clock on the 23d ;
</p>
<p>to be general in all the parts of the kingdom ;
</p>
<p>that all the English inhabitants are to be cut off;
</p>
<p>and that all the posts that could be, could not
</p>
<p>prevent it. As this is the cardinal point in the
</p>
<p>affair, on which the whole turns, if it can be
</p>
<p>proved to be so unequivocally false and ground-
</p>
<p>less, as to be utterly destitute of even the shadow
</p>
<p>of truth, then is the entire story a fabrication,
</p>
<p>and O'Conally a perjurer.
</p>
<p>XLI. That this explosion did not take place ;
</p>
<p>and that, of course, there could not possibly have
</p>
<p>been a general conspiracy, we have superabun-
</p>
<p>dant testimony, as will appear in the subsequent

<p>XLII. We will first premise, that, as the arrest
</p>
<p>of Mac-Mali on and Macguire, in consequence of
</p>
<p>the pretended discovery of the sham plot, took
</p>
<p>place on the 23d of October, at five o'clock in
</p>
<p>the morning, just five hours before the time fixed
</p>
<p>for commencing the massacre, that circumstance
</p>
<p>could not have prevented an explosion in any
</p>
<p>other part of the kingdom, except in a very small
</p>
<p>portion of the circumjacent vicinity.
</p>
<p>XLIII. Yet on Monday, the 25th of October,
</p>
<p>the lords justices wrote an elaborate and detailed
</p>
<p>account of the proceedings of the insurgents in
</p>
<p>the north of Ireland, with a prolix statement of
</p>
<p>various outrages, not only without the least hint
</p>
<p>or surmise, but even an utter exclusion of every
</p>
<p>idea, of murder or shedding of blood.*
</p>
<p>* In the despatch above referred to, dated October 25th, the
</p>
<p>lords justices, after having given an account of sundry out-
</p>
<p>rages perpetrated by the insurgents in Ulster, without a word
</p>
<p>respecting bloodshed, add, u And this, though too much, is all
</p>
<p>that we yet hear is done by them." 359 This sentence, and the
</p>
<p>declaration in the* proclamation of the 29th, that the insurrection
</p>
<p>was confined to " such of the mere old Irish in the province
</p>
<p>of Ulster, as have plotted, contrived, and been actors in this
</p>
<p>treason, and others who adhere to them," set the broad seal of
</p>
<p>condemnation and flagrant falsehood on the murderous part of
</p>
<p>O'Conally's deposition; and it is unnecessary to add, that
</p>
<p>when the main point of a story is proven to be false, the whole
</p>
<p>may be pronounced to be
</p>

<p>XLIV. And further, we invoke the most earnest
</p>
<p>attention of the reader to this all-important fact:
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the pretended generality of the
</p>
<p>plot, the lords justices, by public proclamation,
</p>
<p>on the 29th of October, declared, that the insur-
</p>
<p>rection was confined to " the mere old Irish of
</p>
<p>the province of Ulster, and others who adhered
</p>
<p>to them ;" and that they were well assured of the
</p>
<p>fidelity of the old English of the Pale, and of the
</p>
<p>other parts of the kingdom.*
</p>
<p>XLV. These two strong facts prove that such
</p>
<p>parts of O'ConaUy's deposition as relate to the
</p>
<p>general extent of the conspiracy, and the plot to
</p>
<p>" cut off all the Protestants throughout the king-
</p>
<p>dom," are wholly false, and that he of course
</p>
<p>was an abandoned perjurer ; and would decide

<p>numerous, could not persuade the lords justices and council to
</p>
<p>spare him any. He was a brave old soldier, of great experi-

<p>ence and ability ; and did every thing that it was possible for
</p>
<p>a man to do with one troop of horse, -which -was all his guard

<p>for the whole province; a guard scarcely sufficient to repress

<p>the insolence of robbers, in a time of profound peace, much

<p>less in a time of such general spoil and disturbance. But, with

<p>continued quiet for above six weeks ! ! ! Indeed, no man of

<p>the time when the insurrection commenced in Munster ; the

<p>former dating it " the beginning," and the latter " the midst,"

</p>
<p>inveteracy against the Irish, could not obtain arms or soldiers

<p>sufficient for a time of peace, much lessor a juncture of dis-
</p>
<p>traction and disorder. Yet the strength of the English Pro-
</p>
<p>testants, and the loyalty of the Irish gentry, as yet preserved
</p>
<p>this province from any material disorder.' 1 '' 36 *

<p>that province, except a few pillagers in the county of Sligo, had,

</p>
<p>in continual alarm for twenty-five years, by the prospect of a

<p>nine in the evening, received intelligence of a
</p>
<p>plot, to explode at ten the next morning, and

<p>the names of some of the principal conspirators,

<p>was " confined to the mere old Irish in the pro-
</p>
<p>vince of Ulster, and others who had joined them?"
</p>
<p>XI. That though the lords justices had recourse
</p>
<p>to the execrable expedient of putting Mac-Mahon
</p>
<p>and others to the rack, they should not have
</p>
<p>extorted a word from any of them, to support
</p>
<p>the charge of murderous intentions, if any con-
</p>
<p>spiracy had existed, for "cutting off all the Pro-
</p>
<p>testants and English throughout the kingdom ?"
</p>
<p>XII. That if there were a general conspiracy,
</p>
<p>and of course a large assemblage of people in
</p>
<p>Dublin, for the purpose of seizing the castle on
</p>
<p>the 23d, the lords justices would not have been
</p>
<p>able, on the morning of that day, to apprehend
</p>
<p>more than two of the leaders and a few common
</p>
<p>servants ?

<p>XIII. And finally, whether, the deposition of

<p>false, and he of course perjured, in the two vital

<p>II. The determination to massacre all who
</p>
<p>would not join in it,
</p>
<p>There can be any credit whatever attached to

<p>the remainder of his testimony ? And whether
</p>
<p>it does not necessarily follow, that the whole

<p>Before the reader decides on answers to these
</p>
<p>queries, it is hoped he will bear in mind the
</p>
<p>strong facts adduced in Chapter XIV. to prove
</p>
<p>that the seventeenth century was, in the fullest
</p>
<p>sense of the word, the age of perjury, forgery,
</p>
<p>and fabricated plots. He will there see, that
</p>
<p>in London, at that period, the boasted courts of
</p>
<p>justice were, as we have said, mere slaughter-
</p>
<p>houses, where the depositions of men, stained
</p>
<p>and covered over with crimes of the most atro-
</p>
<p>cious nature, as the leopard is covered with spots,
</p>
<p>were received, in cases where the lives of inno-
</p>
<p>cent men were at stake, and were finally immo-
</p>
<p>lated. He will likewise behold the horrible fact,
</p>
<p>that the testimony of a man whose perjury was
</p>
<p>detected in open court, and there confessed by him-
</p>
<p>self, was afterwards received, and was the means
</p>
<p>of consigning innocent persons to the ignomi-
</p>
<p>nious death of the gallows.
</p>
<p>Let him also bear in mind, that forged plots,
</p>
<p>supported by perjury, and occasionally by the
</p>
<p>stupid and clumsy contrivance of letter-dropping,*
</p>
<p>had been one of the steady and uniform machines
</p>
<p>of the government ofr Ireland, from the invasion
</p>
<p>to that period ; and had produced the forfeiture
</p>
<p>of 'millions of acres.
</p>
<p>And further, let it not be forgotten, that all the
</p>
<p>writers, Clarendon, Carte, Warner, Leland, Gor-
</p>
<p>don, fyc. agree, that the grand object of the lords

<p>CHAPTER XVI.
</p>
<p>The lords justices alarmed at the prospect of
</p>
<p>peace. Corroboration of their guilt. Success-
</p>
<p>ful in their endeavours to prolong and extend
</p>
<p>the horrors of war. Execrable policy of the
</p>
<p>English Parliament.
</p>
<p>THE tenor of the narrative of the origin of
</p>
<p>the insurrection in 1641, as detailed in the pre-
</p>
<p>ceding chapter, hears such strong internal evi-
</p>
<p>dence of fraud and imposture, as can hardly fail
</p>
<p>to convince every man of candour, that it was
</p>
<p>a concerted and nefarious plan, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of goading the Irish into insurrection, and con-
</p>
<p>tinuing the system of spoliation, of which the
</p>
<p>history of Ireland presents to the harrowed feel-
</p>
<p>ings of the reader one unbroken series.
</p>
<p>This evidence derives important corroboration
</p>
<p>from the subsequent conduct of the rulers of the
</p>
<p>country, which of itself would be sufficient to
</p>
<p>convict them, even had the story been so well
</p>
<p>concocted as to wear a plausible aspect. This
</p>
<p>conduct we now expose to the consideration and

<p>GUILT OF LORDS JUSTICES. 347
</p>
<p>As a preliminary, we presume it will hardly be
</p>
<p>denied, that those who are opposed to a resto-
</p>
<p>ration of peace ; who use every effort to extend
</p>
<p>the horrors of war ; who expect to profit hy that
</p>
<p>extension ; and who devour the anticipated pro-
</p>
<p>fits, may, without any unreasonable jealousy, be
</p>
<p>suspected, unless there be strong reasons to the
</p>
<p>contrary, of having been instrumental in the com-
</p>
<p>mencement of war. But where, in addition to
</p>
<p>these circumstances, there appear, as in this in-
</p>
<p>stance, in their own narrative, manifest fraud and
</p>
<p>deception, then we have that strong degree of
</p>
<p>presumptive evidence of which alone the nature
</p>
<p>of the case admits.
</p>
<p>We undertake, therefore, to prove, by testi-
</p>
<p>mony the most irrefragable :
</p>
<p>I. That the lords justices left nothing undone
</p>
<p>to extend the flames of civil war, and to involve
</p>
<p>in the confiscation attendant on it all the estated
</p>
<p>men in the kingdom ;*
</p>
<p>* " It is certain that the lords justices, not only by their
</p>
<p>words and actions, expressed their unwillingness to stop the
</p>
<p>growth of the rebellion (as appeareth undeniably in their re-
</p>
<p>fusing the offers which both the earl of Ormond and the Par-
</p>
<p>liament of Ireland made to suppress it) but showed also a
</p>
<p>desire to increase the distempers of the nation, and rvere often
</p>
<p>heard to wish, that the number were greater of such as became
</p>
<p>criminal" 31 ' 1
</p>
<p>" The marquis of Ormond detested the violent and destruc-
</p>
<p>tive counsels and measures of the lords justices, which had
</p>
<p>spread the rebellion; were ruinous to his majesty's affairs ; and
</p>
<p>likely to effect the utter desolation of his country" 5

<p>II. That they, and their friends in England,
</p>
<p>took infinite pains to defeat every attempt for the
</p>
<p>restoration of peace, or even a cessation of hos-
</p>
<p>tilities, on any terms whatever ; and were, there-
</p>
<p>fore, with the rage of demons, determined on a
</p>
<p>war of extermination ; and
</p>
<p>" An Irish parliament sat for three days in Dublin. By ex-
</p>
<p>pelling the members actually in rebellion, and by excluding
</p>
<p>those who refused to take the oath of supremacy, they were
</p>
<p>reduced to an inconsiderable number. Yet they breathed the
</p>
<p>utmost fury against the Romish party ; declared for a rigor-
</p>
<p>ous execution of the penal statutes ; and urged, both to the king
</p>
<p>and English Parliament, the necessity of new and severe laws
</p>
<p>against recusants. The English parliament echoed these sen-
</p>
<p>timents. The bills were prepared for transmission, and the
</p>
<p>utmost vengeance denounced against Popery ; as if their sole
</p>
<p>purpose -were to exasperate the insurgents to the utmost, or as
</p>
<p>if they had been already completely reduced." 379
</p>
<p>" To involve as many as possible in the guilt of rebellion was
</p>
<p>part of the plan adopted by the party of the lords justices,
</p>
<p>whose great object was an extensive forfeiture of lands. Their
</p>
<p>agents were indefatigable in the procuring of indictments, not
</p>
<p>only against open rebels, but also those whose conduct was at
</p>
<p>all capable of being brought into question. Against the gen-
</p>
<p>try of the Pale was principally directed the rage of their pro-
</p>
<p>secution." 380
</p>
<p>" It is too evident, that as the supine carelessness of some
</p>
<p>did encourage the Irish to rebel, so there were others in power,
</p>
<p>who were so taken up with the contemplation of forfeitures,
</p>
<p>that they rather increased the fuel, than took care to suppress
</p>
<p>the flame." 381

<p>III. That they devoured in idea the estates of

<p>those whom they goaded into insurrection.*
</p>
<p>The evidence produced in the second chapter,
</p>
<p>page 58 to 62, might be deemed sufficient for the
</p>
<p>purpose. It is copious, conclusive, and irresist-
</p>
<p>ible. But more than ordinary pains, and a greater
</p>
<p>host of testimony than usual, are necessary for a
</p>
<p>writer who enters the lists against inveterate
</p>
<p>opinions, long regarded as incontrovertible, and
</p>
<p>cherished under the invigorating and congenial
</p>
<p>* " The lords justices, in a private letter of their own to the
</p>
<p>speaker, exclusive of the rest of the council, besought the Com-
</p>
<p>mons to assist them with a grant of some competent proportion
</p>
<p>of the rebels' lands ! Here the reader will find the key that
</p>
<p>unlocks the whole secret of their iniquitous practices ; and here
</p>
<p>he will find the motives to the orders they gave for receiving no
</p>
<p>submissions ; for issuing no proclamations of pardon at first, as
</p>
<p>the Parliament had suggested ; and in short for all their back-
</p>
<p>wardness in putting an end to the rebellion, of which several
</p>
<p>opportunities offered j and consequently for their sacrificing
</p>
<p>the peace and happiness of their country, and the lives of
</p>
<p>thousands of their fellow subjects." 382
</p>
<p>" Extensive forfeitures -were the favourite object of the chief
</p>
<p>governors and their friends. The Commons of England had
</p>
<p>very early petitioned that the king would not alienate any of
</p>
<p>the escheated lands, that might accrue to the crown from the
</p>
<p>rebellion in Ireland : and they had lately proceeded in a
</p>
<p>scheme for raising money from the lands thus expected to es-
</p>
<p>cheate. A bill was framed for repaying those who should ad-
</p>
<p>vance certain sums, for suppressing of the rebels, (as was
</p>
<p>pretended,) by vesting them with proportional estates in Ire-
</p>
<p>land, on terms highly advantageous to a new English planta-
</p>
<p>tion. It evidently tended to exasperate the malcontents, and to
</p>
<p>make all accommodation desperate : but it was not on this ac-

<p>influence of bigotry, selfishness, and strong pre-
</p>
<p>judice. We therefore proceed to produce facts,
</p>
<p>to establish these important positions.
</p>
<p>A proclamation, of an ambiguous character,
</p>
<p>was published in January, 1642, which appeared
</p>
<p>to promise pardon to such of the insurgents as
</p>
<p>laid down their arms, and submitted themselves
</p>
<p>to the government. Numbers of the lords of the
</p>
<p>Pale, who had been reluctantly goaded into the
</p>
<p>war by the brutal ferocity of Sir Charles Coote,
</p>
<p>acting under the desolating orders of the lords
</p>
<p>justices, gladly availed themselves of this invita-
</p>
<p>tion ; laid down their arms } surrendered to the
</p>
<p>duke of Ormond ; claimed his protection ; and
</p>
<p>flattered themselves with the fond, but alas ! de-
</p>
<p>lusive hope of being restored to peace and safety.
</p>
<p>Had they been received with the indulgence and
</p>
<p>forgiveness the proclamation appeared to offer,
</p>
<p>their example would have been generally, if not
</p>
<p>universally, followed, and the horrors of war
</p>
<p>brought to an early close ; or if any number .re-
</p>
<p>jected the proffered mercy, they could have been
</p>
<p>readily crushed.
</p>
<p>The lords justices were as dreadfully alarmed
</p>
<p>as a fell tiger, whose prey has nearly escaped his
</p>
<p>ravenous jaws. All their hopes of plunder were
</p>
<p>likely to be defeated, and their golden harvest of
</p>
<p>confiscation to be snatched out of their hands, at
</p>
<p>the moment when they regarded it secure be-

</p>
<p>them from a result that would have defeated all
</p>
<p>their schemes, but which blasts their character
</p>
<p>for ever, and exposes them to infamy and abhor-
</p>
<p>rence. They ordered Ormond to admit of no
</p>
<p>more submissions ; to receive those that offered
</p>
<p>to surrender themselves, merely as prisoners of
</p>
<p>and, in order to avoid the danger of
</p>
<p>* " They who had not engaged in actual hostilities, they who
</p>
<p>were only accused of harbouring, or paying contributions to
</p>
<p>the rebels, crowded to the earl of Ormond, and claimed the ad-
</p>
<p>vantage of the royal proclamation. The lords justices, who
</p>
<p>not only favoured the designs of their friends in England, but
</p>
<p>expected to have their own services rewarded by a large portion
</p>
<p>of forfeitures, resolved to discourage these pacific dispositions.
</p>
<p>Ormond was directed to make no distinction between noble-
</p>
<p>men and other rebels ; to receive those who should surrender
</p>
<p>only as prisoners of war ; and to contrive that they should be
</p>
<p>seized by the soldiers, without admitting them to his presence.
</p>
<p>They who were sent, in custody, to Dublin, though men of
</p>
<p>respectable characters, and families engaged in no action with
</p>
<p>the rebels, some, sufferers by their rapine, averse to their pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings, known protectors of the English, were all indiscrimi-
</p>
<p>nately denied access to the justices ; closely imprisoned ; and
</p>
<p>threatened with the utmest severity of the law." 384
</p>
<p>" A cessation was recommended by Clanricarde, as a means
</p>
<p>of giving them some leisure to reflect on their precipitate con-
</p>
<p>duct ; to recall them to their allegiance ; and to prevent the de-
</p>
<p>solation of the kingdom: but the chief governors were actuated
</p>
<p>by different motives. They severely condemned the protection
</p>
<p>granted to Galway : their orders were express and perempto-
</p>
<p>ry, that the earl should RECEIVE NO MORE SUBMISSIONS :
</p>
<p>every commander of every garrison was ordered not to pre-
</p>
<p>sume to hold any correspondence with the Irish, or Papists ;
</p>
<p>to give no protections; but to prosecute all rebels and their har-

</p>
<p>being forced to pardon any of the repentant in-
</p>
<p>surgents, who might induce the duke to pledge
</p>
<p>his honour for their safety, they directed him to
</p>
<p>contrive, as far as practicable, that they should
</p>
<p>be seized by the soldiers, and thus debarred of
</p>
<p>access to his person. These orders were given
</p>
<p>to all their other officers, and produced the hor-
</p>
<p>rible effects the wretched miscreants intended, to
</p>
<p>prolong and extend the horrors of war, and mul-
</p>
<p>tiply confiscations to their utmost wish.
</p>
<p>They had subsequently instructions from the
</p>
<p>Parliament of England to issue a proclamation,
</p>
<p>offering a pardon, on certain conditions, to such
</p>
<p>as would submit to their authority, and abandon
</p>
<p>the cause of the insurgents. With these instruc-
</p>
<p>tions, they did not comply; and assigned the futile
</p>
<p>reason, that their former proclamation had been
</p>
<p>unavailing, although they had themselves, by
</p>
<p>their sinister policy, rendered it nugatory.*
</p>
<p>* " In another instance, the conduct of these wretchecLgover-
</p>
<p>nors was still more suspicious. The parliament of England
</p>
<p>had recommended the offer of a general pardon to such rebels
</p>
<p>as should submit within a certain time, to be limited by the
</p>
<p>lords justices. No proclamation was published, no pardon
</p>
<p>offered, in consequence of these instructions. To palliate this
</p>
<p>omission, they pleaded the inefficacy of their former procla-
</p>
<p>mations : the first of which only called on the king's sub-
</p>
<p>jects to abandon the rebels, without any positive assurance of
</p>
<p>mercy : the other offered a pardon, not to the rebels of Ulster,
</p>
<p>where the insurrection chiefly raged, but to those of Longford
</p>
<p>and Louth, Meath, and Westmeath. In the two last counties
</p>
<p>no body of rebels had appeared. And if any outrages or in-

</p>
<p>A cessation of hostilities had been an object
</p>
<p>ardently desired by the king, and by the leaders
</p>
<p>of the Irish insurgents : by the former, in the
</p>
<p>hope of deriving aid from his forces in Ireland,
</p>
<p>towards subduing the armies of the Parliament ;
</p>
<p>and by the latter, to be restored once more to the
</p>
<p>blessings of peace. The bigotry of Charles, and
</p>
<p>the sinister policy of Ormond, procrastinated this
</p>
<p>desirable event, and aided the views of the lords
</p>
<p>justices and their party, who had thrown every
</p>
<p>possible difficulty in the way of an accommoda-
</p>
<p>tion. It was, nevertheless, at length concluded,
</p>
<p>in despite of all the obstacles that folly and wick-
</p>
<p>edness had devised. It is at this time hardly
</p>
<p>credible, but it is sacredly true, that this act, at
</p>
<p>which all good men must have rejoiced ; which
</p>
<p>did not compromit an iota of the honour, interest,
</p>
<p>to defeat the effect of their pardon, by exceptions and conditions.
</p>
<p>All freeholders of these four counties; all who had shed blood
</p>
<p>in any action ; all who were in prison for spoil or robbery,
</p>
<p>were expressly excluded from mtrcy. To others, it was ten-
</p>
<p>dered on condition of their submitting within ten days after
</p>
<p>the proclamation, and restoring all the property they had
</p>
<p>seized, which had quickly been dispersed through various
</p>
<p>hands. Such a proclamation was evidently absurd and insi-
</p>
<p>dious. A pardon offered in the name of the English parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, must have had greater influence than any act of an Irish
</p>
<p>ministry, despised and suspected by the body of the nation.
</p>
<p>But the chief governours and their creatures were confident of

<p>support, and experienced in the art of converting forfeitures to

<p>their nvn advantage."

<p>when the Irish had manifestly the advantage over

<p>their enemies, in point of military force and re-

</p>
<p>dency to the Roman Catholics.* It affords a most
</p>
<p>important addition to the various proofs we have

<p>tions, and creatures, had used as much skill and industry to im-

<p>prove and continue the rebellion, as ever the first conspirators
</p>
<p>did to begin it, were enraged to see a stop put to the further

<p>effusion of blood, and a foundation laid for a pacification, which
</p>
<p>would defeat their schemes of extirpation.

<p>" They protested against all peace with the rebels, without re-

<p>gard to the terms of any ; which must have entailed a perpe-

<p>tual war on the kingdom of Ireland, till the nation itself was
</p>

<p>disclaimed the cessation. And though, when he had first

<p>slaughtered some unoffending Irish peasants, he consented to
</p>
<p>wait the orders of the state of Scotland, or Parliament of Eng-

<p>land, before he should proceed to further acts of hostility, yet

<p>he soon received instructions to carry on the war, without re-

<p>of extirpation, which terrifying and making the nobility and

<p>will give to the practice of Popery, when these rebellious Pa-

<p>Was there a massacre of the Protestants in

</p>
<p>HAVING, as we hope and trust, satisfactorily
</p>
<p>disposed of the question of the pretended con-
</p>
<p>spiracy, in 1641, for a general massacre of ." such
</p>

<p>derers, we now proceed to investigate and com-

<p>bat the legendary tales of the immense numbers
</p>
<p>which, in the miserable romances, honoured with
</p>
<p>the prostituted titles of histories of the Irish re-
</p>
<p>bellion in 1641, are stated to have been massa-
</p>
<p>cred by the Irish : and we feel confident that we
</p>
<p>shall satisfy the reader, that they are entitled to
</p>
<p>exactly the same degree of credit as lord Claren-
</p>
<p>don's millenium, which has figured to so much
</p>
<p>advantage in our preceding chapters.
</p>
<p>In order to proceed correctly in the investiga-
</p>
<p>tion, our first step will be. to ascertain the exact

<p>state of the allegations which we mean to dis-
</p>
<p>prove. We will therefore let the parties narrate

<p>" The day appointed for executing this bloody design was

<p>the 23d of October, on which day they were to rise all over

<p>" A general insurrection of the Irish spread itself over the
</p>
<p>whole country, in such an inhuman and barbarous manner,
</p>
<p>that there were forty or fifty thousand of the English Pro-
</p>
<p>testants murdered, before they suspected themselves to be in
</p>
<p>any danger, or could provide for their defence, by drawing
</p>
<p>together into towns or strong houses." 404
</p>
<p>" Though they were prevented of surprising Dublin, by a
</p>
<p>mere accident, yet through the country, it has been thought,
</p>
<p>that in one -week they massacred very near one hundred thou-
</p>
<p>sand persons, men, women, and children! ! T 406
</p>
<p>That " Saul slew his thousands, and David his
</p>
<p>tens of thousands,'' was, in " olden time," sung
</p>
<p>by the women of Israel. Every Philistine was
</p>
<p>magnified into ten ; every ten into a hundred ;
</p>
<p>and every hundred into a thousand. But the
</p>
<p>amplifying powers of the Jewish women fade
</p>
<p>into insignificance, when compared with those of
</p>
<p>the Anglo-Hibernian writers. Every Englishman
</p>
<p>that fell in battle, or otherwise, was murdered.

<p>Every man was magnified into a hundred; every

<p>Such a spirit of exaggeration has prevailed,

<p>in common occurrences, hardly calculated to

<p>The materials for Irish statistics, at that early
</p>
<p>period, are rare ; a deficiency which involves this
</p>
<p>subject in considerable difficulty. Had we ample
</p>
<p>and correct tables of the population of Ireland,
</p>
<p>our task would be comparatively easy ; and we
</p>
<p>could put down all those tales, with as much ease
</p>
<p>as we have stamped the seal of flagrant falsehood
</p>
<p>on so many impostures as we have already inves-
</p>
<p>tigated.
</p>
<p>But we avail ourselves of a sound rule, that we
</p>
<p>must employ the best evidence that the nature
</p>
<p>and circumstances of the case will admit ; and,
</p>
<p>fortunately, we have some data, of authority very
</p>
<p>far from contemptible, on which to reason, in the
</p>
<p>present instance ; which will shed the light of

<p>truth on this intricate question, and dispel the
</p>
<p>dense clouds with which it has been environed

<p>by fraud and imposture.
</p>
<p>Sir William Petty, the ancestor of the Lans-
</p>
<p>downe family, laid the foundation of a princely

<p>fortune, by the depredations perpetrated on the
</p>
<p>Irish, after the insurrection of 1641. Of course,
</p>
<p>he had no temptation to swerve from the truth
</p>
<p>in their favour : on the contrary, it was his in-
</p>
<p>terest, equally with the other possessors of the
</p>
<p>estates of the plundered Irish, to exaggerate their
</p>
<p>real crimes, and to lend the countenance of his
</p>
<p>reputation to their pretended ones. Hence his

<p>testimony, on this ground, and as a cotempo-

</p>
<p>We will therefore freely cite him in the case :
</p>
<p>and the reader will at once perceive to what an
</p>
<p>extent delusion has been carried, on this subject.
</p>
<p>He states the aggregate of the Protestants who
</p>
<p>perished in eleven years, to have been 11 2,0 00 ; 40T
</p>
<p>of whom " two-thirds were cut off by war, plague,
</p>
<p>and famine." It is obvious to the meanest capa-
</p>
<p>city, if, of 112,000, the whole number that fell in
</p>
<p>that space of time, two-thirds were cut off by war,
</p>
<p>plague, and famine, that those who fell out of
</p>
<p>war, in eleven years, were only 37,000 ! We
</p>
<p>hope to prove, that even this statement, so com-
</p>
<p>paratively moderate, is extravagantly beyond the
</p>
<p>truth. But, admitting it to be correct, what a
</p>
<p>wonderful difference between 37,000 in eleven
</p>
<p>years, and the hundreds of thousands in a few
</p>
<p>months, that make such an appalling figure in
</p>
<p>the various "tales of terror," imposture, and
</p>
<p>perjury, so feelingly narrated by Temple, Borlase,
</p>
<p>Clarendon, May, Baker, Frankland, Rapin, Le-

<p>credit of their tales, when thus brought to the
</p>
<p>test of the talisman of truth, disappear, and,
</p>
<p>u Like the baseless fabric of a vision,

<p>tables, which throw considerable light on this
</p>
<p>subject. They are very meagre, it is true ; but,
</p>
<p>meagre as they are, we believe there are no
</p>
<p>others ; at all events, we know of none : and
</p>
<p>must therefore avail ourselves of them.
</p>
<p>He informs us, that the population of Ireland,
</p>
<p>in 1641, was 1,466,000 ;* and that the relative
</p>
<p>proportion of the Protestants to the Catholics,
</p>
<p>was as two to eleven :f of course, it follows,
</p>
<p>* " This shows there were, in 1641, 1,466,000 people." 408
</p>
<p>f u The proportion was as 2 to II." 409
</p>
<p>We for the present admit this proportion ; as, however
</p>
<p>exaggerated the number of the Protestants may be, it does not
</p>
<p>affect the point at issue. But, from various circumstances,
</p>
<p>we doubt whether there was one Protestant to eleven Roman
</p>
<p>Catholics.

<p>that the population was thus divided: about
</p>
<p>1,241,000 Roman Catholics, and 225,000 Pro-
</p>

</p>
<p>From this conclusion there is no appeal. The
</p>
<p>whole number of Protestants in the island could
</p>
<p>not have exceeded 225,000. The supplies of
</p>
<p>people from England and Scotland, until after

<p>the final defeat, capture, condemnation, and death
</p>
<p>of Charles I. were inconsiderable : and surely
</p>
<p>there does not exist a single man that can
</p>
<p>believe, that out of 225,000, there could have
</p>
<p>been 112,000 destroyed, and the residue been
</p>
<p>able to baffle and defeat the insurgents, who
</p>
<p>comprised the great mass of the nation. It
</p>
<p>will therefore, we trust, be allowed, as an irre-

<p>sistible conclusion, that Sir William Petty's cal-

<p>culation, although so far more moderate than any
</p>
<p>of the " tales of terror" we have quoted at the

<p>commencement of this chapter, is most extrava-
</p>
<p>gantly over-rated, probably trebled or quadru-
</p>
<p>pled ; and must, of absolute necessity, be false.
</p>
<p>This being the case with the lowest of the

<p>calculations, what astonishment must be excited

<p>by Burton's 300,000, in a few months ; Temple's

<p>or Rapin's 40,000, in a few days ! Surely there

<p>On Milton's 626,000 we have already slightly

<p>touched.* We shall therefore now pass him
</p>
<p>over, and notice some of the other writers.
</p>
<p>We have fully established, that in three of the
</p>
<p>provinces, there was not only no massacre, but
</p>
<p>no insurrection, for five or six weeks : of course,
</p>
<p>during that period, warfare of every description
</p>
<p>was confined to Ulster, where the Protestants
</p>
<p>were by no means so numerous as elsewhere.
</p>
<p>But, admitting that they were equally divided in
</p>
<p>the four provinces, then the number in Ulster
</p>
<p>was not quite 60,000 ;f and they possessed seve-
</p>
<p>ral walled towns, had considerable forces, and
</p>
<p>not merely defended themselves against the at-
</p>
<p>tacks of the insurgents, but frequently vanquish-
</p>
<p>ed them. It is therefore certain that the num-
</p>
<p>bers that fell, in any way, must have been very
</p>
<p>inconsiderable, compared with the bloated and

</p>
<p>f Carte, as will appear at the close of this chapter, estimates
</p>
<p>the Protestants in Ulster at about double .60,000, although he
</p>
<p>rates the whole number in Ireland at only 220,000. His as-
</p>
<p>sumption is obviously incorrect ; but, as it cannot possibly
</p>
<p>affect any of our conclusions, we deem it unnecessary to go
</p>
<p>into an examination of its errors.

<p>extravagant statements whereby the world has
</p>
<p>been deceived on this subject.
</p>
<p>Yet Thomas May, secretary to the Long Par-
</p>
<p>liament, who published a history of that Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment, about six years after the commencement
</p>
<p>of the insurrection, had the inexpressible wicked-
</p>
<p>ness or folly, or both, to state, as we have seen,
</p>
<p>that there were " 200,000 men, women, and chil-
</p>
<p>dren murdered, within the space of one month"*
</p>
<p>It cannot be necessary to go into detail, to
</p>
<p>refute this statement. A single glance at the
</p>
<p>preceding facts, the aggregate of the Protestant
</p>
<p>population of the country, and the limited range
</p>
<p>of warfare during the entire " month" that May
</p>
<p>takes into view, will satisfy the reader how utterly
</p>
<p>regardless this writer was of even the slightest
</p>
<p>semblance of truth.
</p>
<p>It is remarkable that Baker and Frankland, in
</p>
<p>their annals, copy the statement of May, without
</p>
<p>the variation of a word.
</p>
<p>We shah 1 furnish another case, more barefaced
</p>
<p>and profligate, if possible, than May's. When the
</p>
<p>cessation was agreed upon, there was, as already
</p>
<p>stated, a most furious outcry raised on the subject,
</p>
<p>throughout the three kingdoms ; and the army in
</p>
<p>Munster, in a remonstrance against it, hazarded

<p>the daring falsehood, that the " depopulations" of

</p>
<p>in Ulster ; to which let the reader add what this
</p>
<p>army might choose to set down for Leinster and
</p>
<p>Connaught, which would probably be at least
</p>
<p>25,000 for each ; thus allowing above 200,000
</p>
<p>for the rest of the kingdom, and the same num-
</p>
<p>ber for Munster ! ! ! or 400,000 for the whole,
</p>
<p>out of 225,000 ! ! ! !
</p>
<p>One more case shall close this odious detail.
</p>
<p>We have seen, even by the account of the lords
</p>
<p>justices themselves, that, on the 29th of October,
</p>
<p>six days after the commencement of the insur-
</p>
<p>rection, it was confined to " the mere old Irish
</p>
<p>in the province of Ulster, and others who ad-
</p>
<p>hered to them."* We have likewise seen, from
</p>
<p>Temple, Leland, and Warner, that at the com-
</p>
<p>mencement, the insurgents so far adhered to " the
</p>
<p>original scheme of the conspiracy" that, " at first,
</p>
<p>few fell by the swordrf except in open war and
</p>
<p>assault :" and yet Sir Philip Warwick gives us to
</p>
<p>understand, tfiat in one week there were 100,000
</p>
<p>massacred, than which, we may venture to assert,
</p>
<p>a more consummate and atrocious falsehood never
</p>
<p>was ushered into the world, for the purposes of

<p>deception. Sir Philip is wholly inexcusable ; as
</p>
<p>his work was not published during the convul-

<p>sions of that period, when there might have been

<p>some difficulty in divesting himself of the influ-

<p>after the restoration, of which it narrates the

<p>occurrences.
</p>
<p>With what ineffable disgust and abhorrence,
</p>
<p>then, must every ingenuous mind revolt at such
</p>
<p>loathsome frauds and impositions !
</p>
<p>On the subject of the pretended massacre, some
</p>
<p>of the observations of Carte are judicious and
</p>
<p>unanswerable ; and would be sufficient, indepen-
</p>
<p>dent of the other evidence we have produced, to
</p>
<p>put down forever those miserable legends about
</p>
<p>so many hundreds of thousands of the Protestants
</p>
<p>cut off in a few weeks, or months, or years, and
</p>
<p>to stamp on the foreheads of their authors the
</p>
<p>broad seal of imposture. He states, that the ex-
</p>
<p>travagant numbers, asserted to be massacred, were
</p>
<p>" more than there were of English, at that time,
</p>
<p>in all Ireland.'"* 10
</p>
<p>" Sir William Petty," he adds, " computes the British, in-
</p>
<p>cluding therein both English and Scotch, to be, before the re-
</p>
<p>bellion, as 2 to 1 1 of the Irish , at -which rate, there were about
</p>
<p>220,000 British in the whole kingdom ! Now it is certain, that
</p>
<p>the great body of the English was settled in Munster and
</p>
<p>Leinster, -where very few murders were committed; and that
</p>
<p>in Ulster, which was the dismal scene of the massacre, there
</p>
<p>were above 100,000 Scots, who, before the general plantation
</p>
<p>of it, had settled in great numbers in the counties of Down
</p>
<p>and Antrim : and new shoals of them had come over, upon the
</p>
<p>plantation of the six escheated counties : and they were so very
</p>
<p>powerful therein, that the Irish, either out of fear of their
</p>
<p>numbers, or some other politic reason, spared those of that
</p>
<p>nation, making proclamation, on pain of death, that no Scots-
</p>
<p>man should be molested in body, goods, or lands, whilst they
</p>
<p>raged with so much fury against the English." 411

</p>
<p>To these facts, he adds the following reflec-
</p>
<p>tions :
</p>
<p>" It cannot therefore reasonably be presumed, that there were
</p>
<p>at most more than 20,OOO English souls, of all ages and sexes,
</p>
<p>in Ulster at that time : and of these, as appears by the lords
</p>
<p>justices' letter, there were several thousands got safe to Dublin;
</p>
<p>besides 6,OOO women and children, which captain Mervyn saved
</p>
<p>in Fermanagh ; and others that got safe to Derry, Colerain,
</p>
<p>and Carrickfergus, and went from these and other parts into
</p>
<p>England." 412 ,,
</p>
<p>It is obvious, that it is impossible to reconcile
</p>
<p>the latter part of this quotation with the rest ; a
</p>
<p>case, as we have repeatedly stated, that incessantly
</p>
<p>occurs in Irish histories. The author informs us,
</p>
<p>on rational grounds, that there were " not more
</p>
<p>than 20,000 English in Ulster;" that "several
</p>
<p>thousands got safe to Dublin;" that " 6,000 women
</p>
<p>and children were saved in Fermanagh;" and that
</p>
<p>" others got safe to Derry, Colerain, and Carrick-
</p>
<p>fergus." These all-important and conclusive facts
</p>
<p>he connects with a statement of " the extreme cru-
</p>
<p>elty with which the insurgents raged against the
</p>
<p>English," and with a notice of a " dismal scene of
</p>
<p>the massacre" the subjects of which massacre are
</p>
<p>not very easily found, and, at all events, could not
</p>
<p>have been very numerous : for, let us add toge-
</p>
<p>ther " several thousands," and " 6,000," and the
</p>
<p>others" who " got safe" into the specified towns,
</p>
<p>where there were numerous garrisons ; where, of

<p>inhabitants of the circumjacent country would
</p>
<p>naturally seek refuge; and where, it is not extrava-
</p>
<p>gant to suppose, that "the others," who thus "got
</p>
<p>safe," might have amounted to some thousands :
</p>
<p>let us then deduct the aggregate from 20,000, the
</p>
<p>total number of English, and we shall find a slen-
</p>
<p>der remainder. But the plain fact is, that the
</p>
<p>writers on this subject are so haunted by the idea
</p>
<p>of a massacre, that although it rests on the sandy
</p>
<p>foundation of forgery and perjury, as shall be fully
</p>
<p>proved in the sequel, and although many of their
</p>
<p>own statements, in the most unequivocal manner,
</p>
<p>give it the lie direct, their minds cannot be di-
</p>
<p>vested of the terrific object. These passages from
</p>
<p>Carte furnish a strong case in point. The most
</p>
<p>ardent friend of Ireland could not desire a much
</p>
<p>more complete proof of the fallacy of the ac-
</p>
<p>counts of the pretended massacre, than is here
</p>
<p>given by this author himself, who, nevertheless,
</p>
<p>wonderful to tell ! appears to resist the evidence
</p>
<p>of his own facts, and to be blind to the obvious
</p>
<p>inference to which they inevitably lead.
</p>
<p>We have already borne strong testimony to
</p>
<p>the general correctness of the intentions of Fer-
</p>
<p>dinando Warner, a clergyman of the church of
</p>
<p>England, as displayed throughout his " History

<p>of the Rebellion and Civil War of Ireland," with

<p>elaborate investigation of the legendary tales of
</p>
<p>the pretended massacre ; and his views of the
</p>
<p>subject well deserve the most serious attention of
</p>
<p>the reader. After stating the uncertainty of the
</p>
<p>accounts, and the consequent difficulty of making
</p>
<p>an exact estimate, he pronounces a strong and
</p>
<p>unequivocal sentence of condemnation on the
</p>
<p>Munchausen tales we are combating ; and avers,
</p>
<p>that
</p>
<p>" It is easy enough to demonstrate the falsehood of the rela-
</p>
<p>tion of every Protestant historian of this rebellion." 413
</p>
<p>He proceeds to render a satisfactory account of
</p>
<p>the grounds on which this statement rests :
</p>
<p>" To any one who considers how thinly Ireland was at that
</p>
<p>time peopled by Protestants, and the province of Ulster parti-
</p>
<p>cularly, -where -was the chief scene of the massacre, THOSE
</p>
<p>RELATIONS UPON THE FACE OF THEM APPEAR INCREDI-
</p>
<p>BLE." 414
</p>
<p>He then enters into an elaborate detail, in con-
</p>
<p>firmation of this opinion, which the reader will
</p>
<p>find in Chapter I. page 20, and which reduces
</p>
<p>the number "murdered" to 4,028; and, let it not
</p>
<p>be forgotten, nearly one-half of even this number
</p>
<p>rests wholly on " report! 7"
</p>
<p>He adds, it is true, nearly double that number,
</p>
<p>who fell victims to ill-usage : thus making an ag-
</p>
<p>gregate of about 12,000. But even in this number
</p>
<p>he himself does not believe : for he closes with a
</p>
<p>strong and decisive condemnation of the state-

<p>ment, in the following remarkable view of the

<p>subject :
</p>
<p>" If we should allow that the cruelties of the Irish, out of

<p>war, extended to these numbers, which, CONSIDERING THE

<p>there is no pretence for laying a greater number to their

<p>charge." 415
</p>
<p>Thus we close this subject with stating, that

<p>these hundreds of thousands are reduced by Carte
</p>
<p>to 20,000, less " several thousands," and " 6,000

<p>Warner to about 12,000, a large portion of which,

</p>
<p>The murderous spirit of these orders for the
</p>
<p>destruction of the harbourers of the insurgents,
</p>
<p>must excite the most unqualified horror and in-
</p>
<p>dignation in every man not utterly destitute of
</p>
<p>the feelings of humanity. It may be readily con-
</p>
<p>ceived, that defenceless individuals, scattered over
</p>
<p>an extensive country, cannot possibly prohibit
</p>
<p>armed bodies of men from access to their houses
</p>
<p>or plantations ; nor can the inhabitants of cities,
</p>
<p>towns, or villages, destitute of fortifications or
</p>
<p>garrisons, prevent their entrance ; the attempt
</p>
<p>would ensure destruction, and could only be dic-
</p>
<p>tated by absolute insanity : and nothing but the
</p>
<p>most flagrant destitution of justice could ever
</p>
<p>induce commanders to punish the bare submis-
</p>
<p>sion to overwhelming force and violence, with
</p>
<p>the rigour and severity due to the perpetration
</p>
<p>of the highest species of crimes.
</p>
<p>Suppose, for a moment, that a civil war raged
</p>
<p>in this country, which God forbid : suppose, fur-
</p>
<p>ther, that an army of five thousand men were to
</p>
<p>stroy, and demolish, all the places, towns, and houses, where the
</p>
<p>said rebels are, or have been, relieved and harboured, and all the

</p>
<p>The phraseology of this ordinance is very am-

<p>biguous, probably through design. It orders to

<p>be murdered, for,

</p>
<p>it is sheer, downright murder it orders, we say.

<p>to be murdered, " all Irishmen and Papists born

</p>
<p>to add, " all Papists born in Ireland," unless they

</p>
<p>whose sex they neither pitied nor spared, hanging up several

<p>women, many of them great with child, whose bellies they
</p>
<p>ript up as they hung, and so let the little infants fall out ; a
</p>
<p>course they ordinarily took with such as they found in that sad
</p>
<p>condition. And sometimes they gave their children to swine.
</p>
<p>Some the dogs eat: and some, taken alive out of their mother's
</p>
<p>bellies, they cast into ditches. And for sucking children, and
</p>
<p>others of a riper age, some had their brains knocked out; others
</p>
<p>were trampled under foot to death. Some they cut in gobbets
</p>
<p>and pieces ; others they ripped up alive. Some were found in

<p>thejields, sucking the breasts of their murdered mothers. Others
</p>
<p>lay stifled in vaults and cellars ; others starved in caves, crying
</p>
<p>out to their mothers rather to send them out to be killed by
</p>
<p>the rebels, than to suffer them to starve there." 422

<p>numbers of the English, after they had done all drudgeries

<p>massacres, which it would be shocking to humanity to repeat.

<p>of their nature could suggest, was put in practice by the com-

</p>
<p>" An universal massacre commenced of the English, now
</p>
<p>defenceless, and passively resigned to their inhuman foes ! ! !
</p>
<p>No age, no sex, no condition was spared. The wife, weeping
</p>
<p>for her butchered husband, and embracing her helpless chil-
</p>
<p>dren, was pierced with them, and perished by the same stroke.
</p>
<p>The old, the young, the vigorous, the infirm, underwent a like
</p>
<p>fate, and were confounded in one common ruin. In vain did
</p>
<p>flight save from the first assault. Destruction was every where
</p>
<p>let loose, and met the hunted victims at every turn." 436
</p>
<p>"Slaughtering the English was represented by the priests as
</p>
<p>the most meritorious of religious acts ! ! They exhorted the peo-
</p>
<p>ple with tears in their eyes to rid the world of these declared
</p>
<p>enemies to the Catholic faith and piety. Many of the rebels
</p>
<p>would say, after bragging of the number of barbarous murders
</p>
<p>they had committed, that they knew if they should die, their
</p>
<p>souls would go immediately to heaven." 427
</p>
<p>" Some thousands of English were burned in their houses ;
</p>
<p>others were stripped naked, and, in hundreds in a drove, prick-
</p>
<p>ed forward with swords and spikes to river sides, and from
</p>
<p>thence pushed headlong into the stream. Some were mana-
</p>
<p>cled and thrown into dungeons, and there left to perish at lei-
</p>
<p>sure. Others were mangled, and left to languish in the high-
</p>
<p>ways. Some were happy enough to suffer the milder death of

</p>
<p>hardened wretch from whom he received his fate. Some were
</p>
<p>mangled and hung upon tenter hooks ! ! Some with ropes round
</p>
<p>their necks, were dragged through woods, bogs, and ditches,
</p>
<p>till they died. Some "were hanged up by the arms, and then cut
</p>
<p>and slashed, to see how many wounds an Englishman could
</p>
<p>endure. Some were ripped up, and their entrails left hanging
</p>
<p>about their heels. These kinds of cruelties were exercised on
</p>
<p>children of all ages, and many women with child suffered the
</p>
<p>same fate. Children were forced to carry their sick and aged
</p>
<p>parents to the place of slaughter !! There were of those bar-
</p>
<p>barians some so ingenious in their cruelty as to tempt their
</p>
<p>prisoners with the hopes of preserving their lives, to imbrue
</p>
<p>their hands in the blood of their relations. Clr dren were in
</p>
<p>this manner impelled to be the executioners - their parents,

<p>had their eyes plucked out ; their ears, no,:e, cheeks, and hands

<p>cut off'; and thus rendered spectacles to satiate the malice of
</p>
<p>their enemies. Some were buried up to the chin, and there

<p>left to perish by degrees. One Protestant minister was put

</p>
<p>the estates of which the Irish were plundered, to
</p>
<p>hope that it would be allowed to sink into ob-
</p>
<p>livion.
</p>
<p>The remaining writers are mere copyists ; and
</p>
<p>not only derive their facts, with occasional am-
</p>
<p>plifications, from Temple, but borrow his very
</p>
<p>language. We shall notice four of them ; Bor-
</p>
<p>lase, Carte, Macauley, and Hume.
</p>
<p>Borlase's history was published in 1688 ; and
</p>
<p>is a most wretched and despicable compilation.
</p>
<p>In one point, however, he has shown a consider-
</p>
<p>able degree of art, in avoiding an impolitic step,
</p>
<p>which Temple took, and which utterly destroyed
</p>
<p>the credibility of his history. The latter, to give
</p>
<p>support to his fabulous narrative, annexes the
</p>
<p>depositions on which it is grounded ; and which
</p>
<p>bear the most indisputable marks of fraud and
</p>
<p>perjury, as has been proved in Chapter II. and
</p>
<p>shall be more fully displayed in the present one,
</p>
<p>whereby it will appear, that nothing but folly
</p>
<p>and wickedness could have devised, nothing but
</p>
<p>the grossest delusion have credited them. Bor-
</p>
<p>lase has stated the number of pretended murders
</p>
<p>in gross, but wholly omitted the depositions, and
</p>
<p>given merely the names of the witnesses, whereby
</p>
<p>his readers have no means of ascertaining the
</p>
<p>rottenness of the foundation on which they rest.

</p>
<p>reader, in page 371, will find that he states, that
</p>
<p>the English were principally settled in Leinster
</p>
<p>and Munster ; that there were few murders com-
</p>
<p>mitted in those provinces; that the insurgents
</p>
<p>spared the Scotch, who composed the great mass
</p>
<p>of the Protestant population of Ulster ; that there
</p>
<p>were not in that province more than 20,000 Eng-
</p>
<p>lish ; that of this number, " several thousands"
</p>
<p>escaped to Dublin ; that "6,000 were saved in
</p>
<p>Fermanagh;'* that "others," not improbably
</p>
<p>thousands, found an asylum in three fortified

<p>towns : and yet

<p>This same historian, in the -very same page,
</p>
<p>and at the distance of a few lines,

<p>Pathetically and feelingly informs his readers,

<p>have frequently had occasion to call the reader's
</p>
<p>attention to it ; and are persuaded, there is not
</p>
<p>elsewhere any parallel to be found. We have
</p>
<p>met with various cases, in which, after the his-
</p>
<p>torian has given a series of strong, bold, deci-
</p>
<p>sive facts, calculated to excite admiration of the
</p>
<p>endowments, sympathy for the sufferings, and

<p>eager wishes for the success, of that oppressed,

</p>
<p>tion, he is led to draw inferences not merely
</p>
<p>unwarranted by his facts, but in direct hostility

</p>
<p>tween fact and induction, there are probably in
</p>
<p>Warner fifty, and in Leland a hundred instances :
</p>
<p>but there is none more remarkable than this of
</p>
<p>Carte. It would be like a search after the phi-

<p>whom he rescued from the skein or the stiletto

</p>
<p>to death ; and the children roasted to death be-
</p>
<p>fore their parents, and the parents before their
</p>
<p>children.
</p>
<p>Of all the writers on this subject, there is none
</p>
<p>deserving of more unqualified censure than
</p>
<p>Hume. He was under the influence of none of
</p>
<p>the dire passions that actuated some of the others.
</p>
<p>With a powerful mind and keen penetration, it
</p>
<p>was his duty to have examined carefully the
</p>
<p>credibility of his authorities ; and it required a
</p>
<p>very cursory examination, indeed, of Temple's
</p>
<p>history, to be satisfied that to quote it was an
</p>
<p>ineffable disgrace. Yet, astonishing to tell, out
</p>
<p>of thirty-four references, in his account of the
</p>
<p>pretended massacre of 1641, there are no less
</p>
<p>than twenty-seven to Temple, only five to Rush-
</p>
<p>worth, and one each to Nalson and Whitelock.
</p>
<p>How utterly unworthy this procedure was of the
</p>
<p>talents and reputation of Hume ; how indelible a
</p>
<p>stain it attaches to his memory ; and how far,
</p>
<p>as respects this individual case, he is reduced to
</p>
<p>a level with the common race of historians, may
</p>
<p>be readily conceived, from the extracts already
</p>
<p>given from Temple's history,* and from those
</p>
<p>which follow in the present chapter. A large
</p>
<p>portion of the most horrible passages, for which
</p>
<p>he quotes Temple's history, are grounded, in that

<p>wretched romance, on hear-say testimony ; which

<p>pear in the course of the present chapter, and

<p>which therefore could not have been unknown

<p>form of reference, but by exact quotation. It
</p>
<p>may be safely asserted, that a more valuable his-
</p>
<p>torical work was never published.* The author,
</p>
<p>in 1764, sent a copy of it to David Hume, then

<p>of the perjury of the witnesses, and of the wick-

</p>
<p>ther, and bound up in thirty-two volumes, which
</p>
<p>are paged, indexed, and preserved with care ;
</p>
<p>and that from these Sir John Temple made a
</p>
<p>selection of those best calculated to answer his
</p>
<p>purpose. We may fairly presume, that, in form-
</p>
<p>ing his anthologia, he culled the sweetest flowers,
</p>
<p>and that those that remain are inferior to those
</p>
<p>he selected. Of the latter, we shall give such
</p>
<p>specimens, as cannot fail to excite the astonish-
</p>
<p>ment and horror of every man whose conscience
</p>
<p>is not seared with the hot iron of inextinguishable
</p>
<p>hatred to Ireland and Irishmen.
</p>
<p>It may be a matter of surprise, why the tales
</p>
<p>were not dressed in better form ; why, since
</p>
<p>plausible stories cost the inventors as little ta-
</p>
<p>lents or trouble as incredible ones, they did not
</p>
<p>frame consistent narratives, which would stand
</p>
<p>the test of examination, and not carry their own
</p>
<p>condemnation with them. The answer is ob-
</p>
<p>vious. The taste of the purchasers regulates the
</p>
<p>manufacture of every article ; and the object be-
</p>
<p>ing to bear down a nation hated for the injustice
</p>
<p>it had suffered, envied for the property it pos-
</p>
<p>sessed, and devoted to destruction by religious
</p>
<p>bigotry and the spirit of rapine and plunder, the
</p>
<p>more terrible the tales, the more acceptable. The
</p>
<p>supernatural power of witches, and the apparition
</p>
<p>of ghosts, were as firmly believed, in those days
</p>
<p>of ignorance, as the existence and justice of the
</p>
<p>solemn league and covenant. Apparitions were

<p>machinery, to prop the evidence of the horrify-
</p>
<p>ing massacre, and wonderfully heightened its ef-
</p>
<p>fect. Millions of acres of land, and hundreds of
</p>
<p>lives, were sacrificed, to appease the manes of
</p>
<p>those, whose screaming, shrieking ghosts were,
</p>
<p>for months together, invoking vengeance on their
</p>
<p>murderers, at Portnedown bridge.
</p>
<p>The depositions quoted by Temple, and which
</p>
<p>form the basis of his history, may be fairly divided
</p>
<p>into four classes :
</p>
<p>I. Those which rest wholly on hearsay ;
</p>
<p>II. Those that assert things contrary to the
</p>
<p>order of nature ; as the appearance of ghosts ;
</p>
<p>III. Those which are so manifestly improbable,
</p>
<p>as to preclude the assent of rational beings ;
</p>
<p>IV. Those which are drawn up without any
</p>
<p>internal evidence of their falsehood.
</p>
<p>That the two first classes are to be rejected,
</p>
<p>without a moment's hesitation, no man will dare
</p>
<p>deny. That they ever were admitted, and that
</p>
<p>such men as Carte, Warner, Leland, and Hume,
</p>
<p>should have made them the basis on which they
</p>
<p>erected their legendary tales, will be matter of
</p>
<p>eternal astonishment.
</p>
<p>The third class merits the same fate. We will
</p>
<p>give two instances, in illustration. May and Tem-
</p>
<p>ple both state, that many of the English were so
</p>
<p>" surbated" by the fatigues of their flight from
</p>
<p>the murderous rebels, that they crawled into
</p>
<p>Dublin on their knees ! To a person unacquaint-

<p>that these miserable fugitives, who were so " sur-
</p>
<p>bated,"* had travelled two or three thousand miles
</p>
<p>over sands or rocks, or both ; and worn out not
</p>
<p>only their shoes and stockings, but their feet.
</p>
<p>He could not conceive that the most distant point
</p>
<p>of the north, from Dublin, was not a hundred and
</p>
<p>fifty miles ; that the average distance of the chief
</p>
<p>seats of the insurrection was only about ninety ;

<p>and the roads neither sandy nor stony. But when

<p>points, and has reflected that a man not goaded
</p>
<p>on by apprehension of skeins or daggers, could
</p>
<p>with ease walk one hundred miles in five or six
</p>
<p>days ; that with such powerful stimuli, he would
</p>
<p>probably travel them in three or four ; that it is
</p>
<p>not usual, in three or four, or even in five or six
</p>
<p>days' travelling, to wear out either shoes or
</p>
<p>stockings ; that even if the shoes or stockings
</p>
<p>were worn out, it requires a far greater extent of
</p>
<p>travelling to wear out the feet ; and that there is
</p>
<p>no instance on record, of a man preferring to
</p>
<p>travel on his knees instead of his feet, especially
</p>
<p>when fleeing from assassins : when he has duly
</p>
<p>weighed these considerations, and various others
</p>
<p>that must arise in his mind, he will conclude,
</p>
<p>that no man would have ever devised such a

<p>wretched story, but an abandoned impostor ; and

<p>that none would give credit to it, but those whose
</p>
<p>folly was exactly commensurate with the fraud
</p>
<p>of the narrator.
</p>
<p>A large portion of the falsehoods that so uni-
</p>
<p>versally abound in Irish history, display, as we
</p>
<p>have had frequent occasion to remark, an equal
</p>
<p>degree of stupidity and wickedness, This is a
</p>
<p>strong case in point. The idea of people flying
</p>
<p>from the skeins and daggers of assassins, and so
</p>
<p>" surbated" by a journey of fifty or a hundred
</p>
<p>miles, as to be obliged to creep or crawl on their
</p>
<p>knees, is so absurd, so ridiculous, so farcical, so
</p>
<p>improbable, as to excite contempt ; and would
</p>
<p>itself, if it stood single, be almost sufficient to
</p>
<p>destroy the credit of any historian, who could
</p>
<p>seriously attempt to impose such a romance on
</p>
<p>the world.
</p>
<p>We shall be pardoned for glancing at another
</p>
<p>case of the testimony of this class. Temple in-
</p>
<p>forms us, that some of those " surbated" fugitives,
</p>
<p>who were " almost naked" refused to cover them-
</p>
<p>selves with clothes which were offerepl them ; that
</p>
<p>they "would not stir to fetch themselves food,
</p>
<p>though they knew where it stood ready for them;"
</p>
<p>and that " they lay in their own dung."* Com-

</p>
<p>to be common beggars, crept into private places : and some of

<p>ment on such legends would be insulting to the

<p>every account of this description is nearly on a

<p>level with the story of the ghosts that were perch-

<p>being involved in the same condemnation. Per-

<p>suborned to shed innocent blood :f and where we

<p>stir to fetch themselves food, though they knew where it stood

</p>
<p>their filthy rags, and even THEIR OWN DUNG! ! not taking
</p>
<p>care to have any thing clean, handsome, or comfortable about

<p>them : and so even worn out with the misery of the journey,

<p>and cruel usage, having their spirits spent, their bodies wast-

</p>
<p>soon after they had recovered this town, very many of them
</p>
<p>died, leaving their bodies as monuments of the most inhuman
</p>
<p>cruelties used towards them. The greatest part of the women
</p>
<p>and children, thus barbarously expelled out of their habitations,
</p>
<p>perished in the city of Dublin : and so great numbers of them

</p>
<p>warranted in rejecting even that small portion of

<p>the evidence which wears a plausible appearance ;
</p>
<p>for it would be extraordinary, if none of the per-
</p>
<p>jurers could tell a consistent story.
</p>
<p>Those who have felt an interest in the support

<p>of fraud and imposture ; whose blind prejudices

<p>rendered them insensible to the forgeries and

</p>
<p>struction, who perhaps had never examined his

<p>book, have endeavoured to secure it a reputation
</p>
<p>and currency of which it is utterly unworthy. The

<p>most remarkable instances are William, bishop
</p>
<p>of Derry, about a century since, and a certain

<p>Francis Maseres, of the Inner Temple, of recent

<p>of encomium suitable for a Livy or a Tacitus.

<p>most extravagant encomiums on Temple,* the

</p>
<p>We would fondly hope, for the sake of their

<p>own reputation, that neither the bishop of Derry
</p>
<p>nor Mr. Maseres had read Temple's history, but
</p>
<p>had taken its character on trust ; for it may be
</p>
<p>safely averred, that no man who has read it, or
</p>
<p>even those disgusting specimens which are here
</p>
<p>exhibited, can give the least credit to it, unless

<p>he be blind and deaf to the most common rules

<p>or at least during the first part of them, by having recourse to
</p>
<p>the excellent History of the Irish Rebellion and Massacre,

<p>ter of the rolls in Ireland, and a member of the king's Privy

<p>Council in Dublin, at the very time of its breaking out, and
</p>
<p>took a zealous and active part in the measures that were

<p>immediately employed for the preservation of that important

<p>city. This account of that horrid event is universally allowed
</p>
<p>to be perfectly true and authentick ! ! and is indeed made up,
</p>
<p>in a great degree, of the depositions of several persons who
</p>
<p>were 'eye-witnesses! of the various assaults, murders, and

</p>
<p>and deceive.

<p>These strong assertions require equally strong

<p>support : no other would bear us out, or warrant
</p>
<p>the use of them. We trust we shall satisfy the
</p>
<p>most fastidious reader, that, however pointed our
</p>
<p>reprobation of Temple's history, it is very far
</p>
<p>from over-strained. It will be an eternal subject
</p>
<p>of astonishment, how it has happened, that a lying
</p>
<p>legend, which carried a load of perjury sufficient
</p>
<p>" to sink a seventy-four," was ever able to sup-
</p>
<p>port itself, and was not, with its wretched author,

<p>" Damned to everlasting" infamy.
</p>
<p>No reason would be sufficient, short of what
</p>
<p>we have already stated ; that the confiscation of

<p>10,000,000 acres of the soil of Ireland, projected
</p>
<p>by the London adventurers, sanctioned by the

<p>Long Parliament,* and in a great measure car-

<p>ried into effect by Oliver Cromwell, depended for

<p>its justification on this history, which interested
</p>
<p>so many thousands in the support of it, that, had
</p>
<p>it been incomparably more fabidous than it really
</p>
<p>is, their influence, particularly as they have, ever
</p>
<p>since its first appearance, been the dominant party
</p>
<p>in Ireland, would have rescued it from the noi-
</p>
<p>some pool of shame, disgrace, and oblivion, fnto

<p>which it would otherwise have been precipitated.

<p>wards bishop of Kilmore. His clerical character
</p>
<p>appeared calculated to produce, and did inspire
</p>
<p>confidence. His testimony is therefore a fair
</p>
<p>subject of discussion. If it pass the ordeal of

<p>she further saith, that the rebels did drown, in a bog, seven-
</p>
<p>teen men, women, and children, at one time, within the said
</p>
<p>parish ; and she is verily persuaded that the rebels, at several

</p>
<p>four thousand Protestants, enforcing the sons and daughters of
</p>
<p>these vert/ aged people, who were not able to go themselves, to

<p>deponent, upwards of twelve thousand in all, who were all killed
</p>
<p>in their flight to the county of Down. The number of the
</p>
<p>people drowned at the bridge of Portnedown are diversely
</p>
<p>reported, according as men staid amongst the rebels. This
</p>
<p>deponent, who staid as long as any, and had better intelligence
</p>
<p>than most of the English amongst them, and best reason to
</p>
<p>know the truth, saith, There were f by their own report} one
</p>
<p>hundred and ninety drowned with Mr. Fullerton ; at another
</p>
<p>time, they threw one hundred and forty over the said bridge ;
</p>
<p>at another time, thirty-six or thirty-seven ; and so continued
</p>
<p>drowning more or fewer, for seven or eight weeks, so as the
</p>
<p>fewest which can be supposed there to have perished, must
</p>
<p>needs be above one thousand, besides as many more drowned
</p>
<p>between that bridge and the great lough of Montjoy, besides
</p>
<p>those that perished by the sword, fire, and famine, in Coubra-
</p>
<p>sil, and the English plantations adjacent; which, in regard
</p>
<p>there escaped not three hundred out of all these quarters, must

<p>of 12,000 slain in the Glenwood, as the rebels
</p>
<p>told this deponent;" there were " 954 murdered
</p>
<p>in one morning, as the rebels themselves told
</p>
<p>him;" there were, moreover, " above 2,000 mur-
</p>
<p>dered in their own houses, as he was informed
</p>
<p>by a Scotsman;" and Sir Phelim O'Neil had
</p>
<p>zvomen, at the siege of Augher. A woman, tenant to the depo-
</p>
<p>nent, killed seven men and -women of her English fellorv -tenants
</p>
<p>in one morning; and it was very usual, in all parts, for their
</p>
<p>Children to murder the Protestants' children; and sometimes
</p>
<p>with lath swords, heavy and well sharpened, they would
</p>
<p>venture upon men and women of riper years, cruelties not
</p>
<p>to be believed, if there were not so many eye-witnesses of
</p>
<p>them." 461
</p>
<p>" And further saith, That the rebels would send their chil-
</p>
<p>dren abroad in great troops, and especially near unto Kinnard,
</p>
<p>armed with long wattles and whips, who would therewith beat
</p>
<p>dead men's bodies about their privy members, until they beat
</p>
<p>or rather thrashed them off; then would return in great joy to
</p>
<p>their parents, who received them for such service as it were
</p>
<p>in triumph." 462
</p>
<p>" Further, this deponent saith, That it was usual sport with
</p>
<p>one Mac-Mahon, captain of the castle and town of Monaghan,
</p>
<p>(as the said Mac-Mahon confessed before Mr. Hugh Echline
</p>
<p>and many others) to take a wooden prick or broach, and thrust
</p>
<p>it up into the fundament of an English or Scotchman, and then
</p>
<p>after drive him about the room with a joint stool, until, through
</p>
<p>extreme pain, he either fainted, or gave content to the specta-
</p>
<p>tors by some notable skips and frisks ; which rare invention
</p>
<p>he offered to put in practice at the same time, and in the same
</p>
<p>place where he boasted thereof, but that the said Mr. Echline
</p>
<p>prevailed with him to omit it, as sufficiently (without any fur-
</p>
<p>ther demonstration) believing the excellency of the sport." 465

<p>The inhumanity of the Irish to the English
</p>
<p>beasts, according to the dean, was really shocking.
</p>
<p>They used to cut collops off their backs, and then
</p>
<p>let them loose in the woods, till, O miraculous !
</p>
<p>they roared the flesh off their backs! This fit of

<p>roaring would sometimes last for two or three

<p>days together !*
</p>
<p>But the most marvellous part of the story is,
</p>
<p>that the dogs and cocks became traitors ! and
</p>
<p>appear to have entered into a league with the
</p>
<p>rebels ! ! For, during " the three first days of the

<p>alarm their masters, " not even when the rebels

</p>
<p>* " At the siege of Augher, they would not kill any English

</p>
<p>alive ; letting them roar till they had no more flesh upon their

<p>together in that torment." 464

<p>in different parts of the province, during his im-

<p>prisonment, with as much confidence as if he had

<p>scruple, avowed his perjury, by stating the sources

</p>
<p>The following extract from Temple's history,
</p>
<p>with the depositions on which it is grounded,
</p>
<p>may serve to amuse the reader, and will throw
</p>
<p>additional light on the mode in which that ro-
</p>
<p>mance was compiled :
</p>
<p>" How grievous and insupportable must it needs be to a
</p>
<p>true Christian soul, to hear a base villain boast, that his hands
</p>
<p>were so weary with killing and knocking down Protestants
</p>
<p>into a bog, that he could not lift his arms up to his head?\ or
</p>
<p>others to say, that they had killed so many Englishmen, that
</p>
<p>the grease or fat which remained on their swords or skeins
</p>
<p>might have made an Irish candle f^. or to consider that two
</p>
<p>young cow-boys should have it, in their power to murder
</p>
<p>thirty-six Protestants . ? " 486
</p>
<p>The instances of mental obliquity exhibited
</p>
<p>by the Anglo-Hibernian writers, which we have
</p>
<p>* " In several places, the Irish came, under divers pretences,
</p>
<p>and borrowed such weapons as the English had in their houses;
</p>
<p>and no sooner got them into their hands, but they turned them
</p>
<p>out of their own doors : as they did at Glaslough, in the coun-

<p>nary. A new one here presents itself.
</p>
<p>The spirit of lying and imposture which per-
</p>
<p>vades those depositions, would naturally induce a
</p>
<p>sane mind to reject them wholly, as undeserving
</p>
<p>of any attention. But, by a most perverted pro-
</p>
<p>cess of reasoning, Leland ascribes these awful
</p>
<p>stories to the terrors excited by the horrible cru-
</p>
<p>elties perpetrated by the Irish, which, he sup-
</p>
<p>poses, preyed on the imaginations of the English,
</p>
<p>and terrified them with the idea of lakes and
</p>
<p>rivers of blood, fyc. ^c.
</p>
<p>" They who escaped the utmost fury of the rebels, languish-
</p>
<p>ed in miseries horrible to be described. Their imaginations
</p>
<p>were overpowered and disordered by the recollections of torture
</p>
<p>and butchery. In their distraction," [let us say, rather, in the
</p>
<p>depraved and loathsome state of the public mind] " every tale
</p>
<p>of horror "was eagerly received, and every suggestion of frenzy
</p>
<p>and melancholy believed implicitly. Miraculous escapes from
</p>
<p>death, miraculous judgments on murderers, lakes and rivers of
</p>
<p>blood, marks of slaughter indelible by every human effort, vi-
</p>
<p>sions of spirits chaunting hymns, ghosts rising from the rivers
</p>
<p>and shrieking out revenge; these and such like fancies were
</p>
<p>received and propagated as incontestible." 489
</p>
<p>It is difficult to conceive of a stronger proof
</p>
<p>of the blindest prejudice than is here exhibited
</p>
<p>by Leland. Whoever has travelled through the
</p>
<p>wretched legends which disgrace and dishonour
</p>
<p>grease or fat which remained on their swords and skeins,
</p>
<p>might well serve to make an Irish candle. Jurat. April 14,

<p>the preceding pages, will at once perceive that
</p>
<p>the object with the perjurers who wrote them,
</p>
<p>was to render their tales as terrific and horrible
</p>
<p>as they could, for the purpose of aggravating the
</p>
<p>abhorrence, and ensuring the ruin, of the op-
</p>
<p>pressed and despoiled Irish. They were quite
</p>
<p>certain, that in the prevailing spirit of the times,
</p>
<p>no improbability or impossibility would be a bar
</p>
<p>to their currency. This is so plain and palpable,
</p>
<p>that it requires only to skim the surface, to per-
</p>
<p>ceive it. Instead, therefore, of believing, with
</p>
<p>Leland, that a man who coolly comes forward,
</p>
<p>and swears to " lakes and rivers of blood," and
</p>
<p>" visions of spirits chaunting hymns," acts under
</p>
<p>the influence of a disordered imagination, in con-
</p>
<p>sequence of the horrors he has witnessed, we are
</p>
<p>warranted, nay constrained to believe, that the
</p>
<p>whole is the creation not of a disordered, but a
</p>
<p>corrupted and lying imagination. Indeed, we are
</p>
<p>perfectly satisfied, that there is not one of our

<p>operation, but will find it impossible to believe

<p>that those terror-inspiring stories could have ever
</p>
<p>proceeded from any other source than the prince
</p>
<p>of darkness, the father of lies.
</p>
<p>We feel that confidence which truth and a good
</p>
<p>cause inspire, that we have convinced every can-

</p>

<p>further proof of the magnitude of the errors that
</p>
<p>have prevailed on the subject of the universality
</p>
<p>of the insurrection. This proof rests on autho-
</p>
<p>rity which the enemies of Ireland will not dare
</p>
<p>dispute.
</p>
<p>Sir William Petty states, that before the insur-
</p>
<p>rection there were 3,000 estated Roman Catholics
</p>
<p>in Ireland ; and that, by judicial investigations in
</p>
<p>the court of claims, held in 1663, it appeared that
</p>
<p>there were not more than 400 of them* engaged^
</p>
<p>in the glorious but unfortunate struggteToTlrish
</p>
<p>liberty, which, even by the friends and partisans
</p>
<p>of the English revolution in 1688, the American
</p>
<p>in 1776, and the French in 1789, is so very erro-
</p>
<p>neously and inconsistently styled a rebellion.!
</p>
<p>And let it be observed, that, notwithstanding the
</p>
<p>very small proportion of the estated Catholics
</p>
<p>who were implicated in the insurrection, we
</p>
<p>have established the fact, that every effort had
</p>
<p>been used by the lords justices to goad the whole
</p>
<p>nation into resistance, for the purpose of con-
</p>
<p>fiscating the ten millions of acres of the soil,
</p>
<p>which they and their friends in England had
</p>
<p>already devoured in imagination.
</p>
<p>* " The number of landed Papists, or freeholders, before the
</p>
<p>wars, was about 3,000, whereof, as appears by 800 judgments
</p>
<p>of the court of claims, which sat anno 1663, upon the inno-
</p>
<p>cence and effects of the Irish, there ivere not above one-seventh

<p>on falsehood and perjury of the very grossest
</p>
<p>kind.
</p>
<p>We proceed to examine the system of warfare
</p>
<p>pursued by the Irish government ; and to ascer-
</p>
<p>tain with what propriety or justice it could com-
</p>
<p>plain of murder and massacre, had the insur-
</p>
<p>gents been really guilty of the crimes alleged
</p>
<p>against them. We pledge ourselves to prove,
</p>
<p>that a more murderous system of warfare never
</p>
<p>prevailed, in any age or any country ; that many
</p>
<p>of their commanders were as merciless^ and as
</p>
<p>bloodthirsty as Attila or Genghis Khan ; and that
</p>
<p>some of the scenes of slaughter were so horrible,
</p>
<p>particularly, as will appear in the sequel, at Cash-
</p>
<p>el, Drogheda, and Wexford, that they never were
</p>
<p>and never could be exceeded, and have been
</p>
<p>rarely equalled.
</p>
<p>In the long catalogue of human follies, there
</p>
<p>is none more unaccountable, more ludicrous, or
</p>
<p>more universal, than that of censuring in others
</p>
<p>those vices and crimes to which we are ourselves
</p>
<p>most prone. Who has not heard elaborate de-
</p>
<p>clamations against intemperance, from drunkards;
</p>
<p>against lust, from debauchees ; against meanness
</p>
<p>and avarice, from misers ? There is not a nation
</p>
<p>in the world, that has not a variety of terse pas-
</p>
<p>sages on this extraordinary propensity.

</p>
<p>The era embraced in our discussions affords a
</p>
<p>most striking illustration of this view of human
</p>
<p>nature. While the
</p>
<p>" Starry welkin has rung"
</p>
<p>with the hoarse din of horrible massacres said
</p>
<p>to have been perpetrated by the Irish, it will
</p>
<p>appear, as clear as the noon-day sun, that the
</p>
<p>Irish rulers, in giving these statements, were
</p>
<p>drawing their own picture: and that the poet's
</p>
<p>" Mutato nomine de te fabula narratur,"f
</p>
<p>was never more appropriate than to those rulers
</p>
<p>and their agents.
</p>
<p>The leading features of the warfare carried on
</p>
<p>by the forces of the Irish government, were,
</p>
<p>I. The Irish, unarmed and wholly defenceless,
</p>
<p>were frequently massacred and drowned, without
</p>
<p>mercy. From this fate, neither priests, women,

<p>nor children, were exempted ;

<p>thrown down their arms ; made no further re-

<p>III. And, to crown ah 1 , after surrender made,
</p>
<p>and quarter promised, the faith pledged to the
</p>
<p>Irish was often perfidiously violated, and they
</p>
<p>were butchered in cold blood.
</p>
<p>It was our intention to have classed the various
</p>
<p>facts, in support of these several allegations, ex-
</p>
<p>actly under their respective heads : but, as many
</p>
<p>of the instances of atrocity which we have col-
</p>
<p>lected, exemplify more than one of our posi-
</p>
<p>tions; and as others, though of equal force, can-
</p>
<p>not properly be classed under any of them, we
</p>
<p>are not able to carry that plan fully into effect.
</p>
<p>We shall, however, adhere to it as closely as
</p>
<p>in our power. But we are convinced, that their
</p>
<p>effect on the reader's mind will depend, not on
</p>
<p>their classification, but on their magnitude, im-
</p>
<p>portance, and authenticity. If, weighed in the
</p>
<p>balance of truth, they be found wanting in these
</p>
<p>essential particulars, no accuracy of arrangement
</p>
<p>can save them from condemnation. But if -they
</p>
<p>stand a scrutiny on those grand points^ their de-
</p>
<p>ficiency in any of the minor ones will not be
</p>
<p>regarded as of material consequence.

<p>ourselves to a disadvantage, of which we are
</p>
<p>A NEW CASE. 441
</p>
<p>persuaded, the world has hitherto afforded no pre-
</p>
<p>cedent. We had provided a large body of authen-
</p>
<p>tic testimony, from Clanrickarde, Castlehaven,
</p>
<p>Walsh, Curry, and other writers on the Irish side
</p>
<p>of the question, of which we proposed to avail
</p>
<p>ourselves. But, being determined to remove all
</p>
<p>possible ground for cavil, we have laid the whole
</p>
<p>aside ; and shall rely solely on two species of
</p>
<p>authorities, which must overwhelm all opposition,
</p>
<p>and settle this question eternally. The first is,
</p>
<p>the despatches and documents of the sanguinary
</p>
<p>ruffians who perpetrated the murders ; and the
</p>
<p>second, the statements of the Anglo-Hibernian
</p>
<p>historians.
</p>
<p>We thus place ourselves in the predicament of
</p>
<p>a man who has a process at law, and has prepared
</p>
<p>ample documents to establish his claims ; but,
</p>
<p>finding his antagonist's documents so strong and
</p>
<p>so powerful against their owner, as to render his
</p>
<p>own unnecessary, he throws them into the fire :
</p>
<p>and, so far as respects the contents of this chapter,
</p>
<p>one of the most important in our work, we care
</p>
<p>not if every page, written in defence of the Irish,
</p>
<p>were committed to the flames.
</p>
<p>Should we, to use the legal phraseology, make
</p>
<p>out our case under these circumstances, as we
</p>
<p>trust we sfiall, it will afford the strongest proof
</p>
<p>that can be desired or conceived, of the intrinsic
</p>
<p>goodness of the cause, and of the extent of the
</p>
<p>delusion that has prevailed on the subject. We are
</p>
<p>well aware of the immense advantages we forego

<p>by this course ; but we forego them cheerfully,
</p>
<p>and have no more doubt of the result, than we
</p>
<p>have that the sun, which is now setting in the
</p>
<p>western horizon, will rise again, resplendent, in
</p>
<p>all its majesty and glory, to illumine a grateful
</p>
<p>and admiring world.
</p>
<p>Those, however, who wish to peruse a list of
</p>
<p>the murders and massacres perpetrated on the
</p>
<p>Irish, as recorded by the writers of that nation,
</p>
<p>are referred to the Appendix to Clarendon's
</p>
<p>" History of the Irish Rebellion," where there is
</p>
<p>a large collection to be found, with due detail of
</p>
<p>time and place.
</p>
<p>Resting wholly on plain matter of fact, we are
</p>
<p>unfortunately debarred of the rhetorical flourishes
</p>
<p>of " lakes and rivers of blood" " spirits chaunting
</p>
<p>hymns" "ghosts rising from the rivers, and
</p>
<p>shrieking out revenge" and all those other " tales
</p>
<p>of horror" and "suggestions of frenzy " which
</p>
<p>decorate the pages of the long train of historians,
</p>
<p>from Temple to Leland, who have exhausted the
</p>
<p>powers of eloquence in embellishing the legends
</p>
<p>of " the execrable Irish rebellion" But we feel
</p>
<p>full confidence, that our

</p>
<p>will "put them down" in the estimation of every
</p>
<p>upright and candid reader.

</p>
<p>ourselves, as we have done, to the accounts of
</p>
<p>the perpetrators of the murders, and their histo-
</p>
<p>rians, it is matter of astonishment, that we have
</p>
<p>been able to adduce such strong evidence. But
</p>
<p>it is a peculiar feature in this history, that the
</p>
<p>criminals narrate their crimes, with as little cere-
</p>
<p>mony as if they claimed glory from them. A few
</p>
<p>circumstances, of peculiar atrocity, which add
</p>
<p>strong corrobo ration to the testimony, are re-
</p>
<p>served for the close of this chapter.
</p>
<p>The pretences on which the Irish were slaugh-
</p>
<p>tered, were, in many instances, of the most frivo-
</p>
<p>lous and contemptible character : but it is a trite
</p>
<p>observation, that those who are wicked enough
</p>
<p>to perpetrate crimes, are never without a plea to
</p>
<p>justify, or at least to palliate, their guilt. Sir S.
</p>
<p>Harcourt besieged a castle in the vicinity of Dub-
</p>
<p>lin, where, venturing too near, he was shot. The
</p>
<p>barbarian besiegers, when they took the castle,
</p>
<p>to" revenge the death of their general, slaughtered
</p>
<p>every man, woman, and child it contained.*

</p>
<p>battering cannon, whilst he waited for these, and was giving
</p>
<p>his soldiers some orders, one of the rebels perceiving him,
</p>
<p>discharged 1m piece at him, and gave him a mortal wound ;
</p>
<p>of which he died -the next day, to the prejudice of the service

<p>Warner relates this atrocious act, not merely
</p>
<p>without censure, but with " apparent" justifica-
</p>
<p>tion, or at least extenuation. He says, "the
</p>
<p>soldiers were so enraged at the cowardly manner
</p>
<p>in which he was killed, that they put all within
</p>
<p>to the sword." This was probably the pretext the
</p>
<p>murderers assigned at the time, and which the
</p>
<p>doctor copied without reflection. It would ap-
</p>
<p>pear that the reverend historian supposed there
</p>
<p>was some ceremony necessary to be observed by
</p>
<p>the garrison of a besieged castle, before they
</p>
<p>shot at their enemies. Perhaps he thought that
</p>
<p>they ought to have sent a herald to Harcourt, to
</p>
<p>warn him to beware of the bullet. This is sheer
</p>
<p>nonsense. Who would dare to censure for cow-
</p>
<p>ardice the man who shot general Wolfe or gene-
</p>
<p>ral Montgomery, at Quebec ; general Mercer, at
</p>
<p>Princeton ; general Ross, at Baltimore ; or general
</p>
<p>Packenham, at New Orleans ? In a word, lives
</p>
<p>there a man absurd enough to aver, that there is
</p>
<p>any cowardice in sending a whizzing bullet to
</p>
<p>salute a besieging enemy, who ventures within
</p>
<p>reach of a shot ?
</p>
<p>That "straws show which way the wind blows,"
</p>
<p>is an adage of more sound sense than elegance.
</p>
<p>An occurrence which Ludlow narrates, with great
</p>
<p>naivete, affords a strong confirmation of the va-
</p>
<p>breach sufficient for them to take the castle by storm, they put

<p>SLAUGHTER. 451
</p>
<p>rious proofs we have already adduced of the
</p>
<p>murderous spirit by which the forces of the Irish
</p>
<p>government were actuated. It evinces, that no
</p>
<p>raging bloodhounds were ever more ravenous
</p>
<p>after their prey, than they were for the slaughter
</p>
<p>of the devoted Irish.
</p>
<p>A few wretched fugitives, who had escaped
</p>
<p>from their enemies, had taken refuge in a cave,
</p>
<p>and were discovered by Ludlow's army, on his
</p>
<p>march. Thirsting for their lives, he spent nearly
</p>
<p>two days in the effort to smother them by smoke;
</p>
<p>but his endeavours failed of success. At length,
</p>
<p>some of his soldiers forced their way into the
</p>
<p>cave, where they found about twenty defenceless
</p>
<p>wretches, whose forlorn state would have almost
</p>
<p>excited the pity of a band of ruthless Creeks or
</p>
<p>Cherokees : but humanity or pity for the Irish
</p>
<p>formed no part of the system then pursued. Fif-
</p>
<p>teen of them were butchered in the cave ; and
</p>
<p>four or five brought out alive, who probably
</p>
<p>shared a similar fate, although the writer is silent
</p>
<p>as to the issue,*
</p>
<p>* " From hence I went to visit the garrison of Dundalk, and
</p>
<p>bein^ upon my return, I found a party of the enemy retired
</p>
<p>within a hollow rock, which was discovered by one of ours,
</p>
<p>who saw five or six of them standing before a narrow passage
</p>
<p>at the mouth of the cave. The rock was so thick, that we
</p>
<p>thought it impossible to dig it down upon them, and therefore
</p>
<p>resolved to try to reduce them by smoak. After some of our
</p>
<p>men had spent most part of the day in endeavouring to smo*
</p>
<p>t/ier those within, by fire placed at the mouth of the cave, they

</p>
<p>This single fact, narrated by the master butcher
</p>
<p>himself, would, if it stood alone, be sufficient to
</p>
<p>establish the infernal spirit with which the armies
</p>
<p>of the government were actuated. It is easy to
</p>
<p>conceive, that those whose thirst of blood induced
</p>
<p>them to arrest a considerable army hi its march,
</p>
<p>and spend two days, in the hope of glutting their
</p>
<p>to be made incapable of resistance by the smoak, some of them
</p>
<p>tvith a candle before them crawled into the rock. One of the
</p>
<p>enemy, who lay in the middle of the entrance, fired his pistol,
</p>
<p>and shot the first of our men in the head, by whose loss we
</p>
<p>found that the smoak had not taken the designed effect. But
</p>
<p>seeing no other way to reduce them, I caused the trial to be
</p>
<p>repeated, and upon examination found that though a great
</p>
<p>smoak went into the cavity of the rock, yet it came out again
</p>
<p>at other crevices ; upon which / ordered those places to be
</p>
<p>closely stopped, and another smother made. About an hour
</p>
<p>and an half after this, one of them was heard to groan very
</p>
<p>strongly, and afterwards more weakly, whereby we presumed
</p>
<p>that the work was done ; yet the fire was continued till about
</p>
<p>midnight, and then taken away, that the place might be cool
</p>
<p>enough for ours to enter the next morning. At which time
</p>
<p>some went in armed with back, breast, and head-piece, to pre-
</p>
<p>vent such another accident as fell out at their first attempt j
</p>
<p>but they had not gone above six yards before they found the
</p>
<p>man that had been heard to groan, who was the same that had
</p>
<p>killed one of our men with his pistol, and who, resolving not
</p>
<p>to quit his post, had been, upon stopping the holes of the rock,
</p>
<p>choaked by the smoak. Our soldiers put a rope about his
</p>
<p>neck and drew him out. The passage being cleared, they en-
</p>
<p>tered, and having put about fifteen to the sword, brought four
</p>
<p>or five out alive, with the priest's robes, a crucifix, chalice, and
</p>
<p>other furniture of that kind. Those within preserved them-
</p>
<p>selves by laying their heads close to a water that ran through

<p>male or female, old or young, bearing the hated

</p>
<p>established by the mass of revolting facts con-
</p>
<p>tained in the present chapter.

<p>A circumstance which occurred in consequence
</p>
<p>of the murderous ordinance of the Long Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment* to give no quarter to Irish prisoners,
</p>
<p>evinces such transcendent injustice and folly, that
</p>
<p>it deserves to be put on record, to display the
</p>
<p>temper of the times, and to prove that the slaugh-
</p>
<p>ter of the Irish was regarded as perfectly innocent.
</p>
<p>The army of the Parliament had taken a num-
</p>
<p>ber of prisoners, among whom were thirteen
</p>
<p>Irishmen, who, in pursuance of the above ordi-
</p>
<p>nance, were immediately executed. Prince Ru-
</p>
<p>pert, bold, brave, and determined, took measures
</p>
<p>to ascertain the fact ; and, as soon as all doubt
</p>
<p>of it was removed, singled out an equal number
</p>
<p>of prisoners belonging to the enemy, and, as
</p>
<p>right and justice required, in order to arrest the
</p>
<p>progress of this murderous system, retaliated on
</p>
<p>them the cruelty of which their officers had set
</p>
<p>such a terrible example.
</p>
<p>It is incredible what an outcry this laudable,
</p>
<p>because necessary, measure of severity excited.

<p>Prince Rupert was made of too " stern stuff,'*
</p>
<p>to be terrified out of his manly purpose. He
</p>
<p>announced his determination to pursue the sys-
</p>
<p>tem of lex talionis, and to murder man for man.*
</p>
<p>There do not appear any data whereon to ground
</p>
<p>an opinion of the ultimate issue of this sanguinary
</p>
<p>rivalry : but it is more than probable, that the
</p>
<p>energy and spirit of the prince stayed the pro-
</p>
<p>gress of the devouring sword, and rescued many
</p>
<p>an unfortunate Irishman from the horrible pro-
</p>
<p>scription of their enemies. Such a system, pur-
</p>
<p>sued steadily, as it ought to have been, by general
</p>
<p>Washington, would have snatched thousands of

<p>" Those soldiers of mine, that were barbarously murdered

<p>such as, during the time they were in Ireland, served his ma-

<p>jesty stoutly, constantly, and faithfully, against the rebels of
</p>
<p>that kingdom ; and, after the cessation there, were, by his ma-
</p>
<p>jesty's command, transported to serve him in this, where they
</p>
<p>honestly performed the duty of soldiers." 534

<p>ever ; for every officer and soldier, so causelessly and barba-
</p>
<p>rously murdered, I will cause so many -of the prisoners re-

<p>Grenville, Sir Charles Coote, Tichbourne, Ireton,
</p>
<p>and Cromwell, stand proudly pre-eminent, as
</p>
<p>prime ministers of Satan, in the horrid work of
</p>
<p>extermination.
</p>
<p>Grenville was naturally ferocious and blood-
</p>
<p>thirsty : but his native ferocity was whetted by
</p>
<p>avarice and rapacity, which goaded him to deeds
</p>
<p>of horror, of the blackest die. He hung old and
</p>
<p>bed-ridden men, for not discovering wealth which
</p>
<p>they did not possess ; and, with equal barbarity,
</p>
<p>hung women, frequently of quality, because they
</p>
<p>had not as much money as he had expected.*
</p>
<p>This barbarian, having been ordered to England,
</p>
<p>pursued the same system of rapine and murder
</p>
<p>there.f
</p>
<p>* " Sir Richard Grenville, upon the fame of being a good
</p>
<p>officer, was sent over with a very good troop of horse ; was
</p>
<p>major of the earl of Leicester's own regiment of horse, and was
</p>
<p>very much esteemed by him, and the more by the Parliament,
</p>
<p>for the signal acts of cruelty he did every day commit upon the
</p>
<p>Irish; which were of so many kinds upon both sexes, young
</p>
<p>and old, hanging old men -who -were bed-rid, because they would
</p>
<p>not discover where their money was, that he believed they
</p>
<p>had; and old women, some of quality, after he had plundered
</p>
<p>them, and found less than he expected ; that they can hardly
</p>
<p>be believed, though notoriously known to be true." 537
</p>
<p>f " He made one of them hang all the rest ; which, to save
</p>
<p>his own life, he was contented to do : so strong his appetite to
</p>
<p>those executions he had been accustomed to in Ireland, without
</p>
<p>any kind of commission, or pretence of authority." 53 *

<p>458 VIND1CIJE HIBERNICJE.
</p>
<p>A few of the characteristic feats of St. Leger,*
</p>
<p>Inchiquin, Monroe, and Coote, grace the fore-
</p>
<p>going pages. Honourable mention remains to
</p>
<p>be made of Tichbourne, Ireton, and Cromwell,
</p>
<p>a bloody triumvirate, whose names ought to be
</p>
<p>held in eternal reprobation by Irishmen and de-
</p>
<p>scendants of Irishmen.
</p>
<p>Henry Tichbourne, governor of Drogheda, sig-
</p>
<p>nalized for his sanguinary career, merited the
</p>
<p>distinction we have accorded him, to be ranked
</p>
<p>with the destroyers, Ireton and Cromwell. In a
</p>
<p>familiar letter to his wife, as a matter of course,
</p>
<p>he communicates the information, that, finding
</p>
<p>he could not induce the Irish to hazard the for-
</p>
<p>tune of a battle, he had concluded " they were in
</p>
<p>another sort to be dealt with ;" and accordingly
</p>
<p>the wretch sallied out " every other morning, for
</p>
<p>several weeks" slaughtering all he met, without
</p>
<p>mercy ; so that he left " neither man nor beast
</p>
<p>alive" for sixteen miles from the garrison.f And
</p>
<p>* " If, in the execution of martial law, he [St. Leger] spared
</p>
<p>neither sex nor age^ his countrymen frequently expressed a
</p>
<p>generous indignation and horror at his barbarity ." s39
</p>
<p>f " Finding that they did only put themselves in arms, and
</p>
<p>would no more now than formerly forsake their strength, to
</p>
<p>draw into equality of ground, notwithstanding their advantage
</p>
<p>of numbers, I concluded they were in another sort to be dealt
</p>
<p>with ; and from thenceforth, for the most part, I fell every
</p>
<p>other morning into their quarters, and continued those visita-
</p>
<p>tions for several weeks together, -with the slaughter of very
</p>
<p>many of them^ especially the new plantation in the county of

</p>
<p>one of his coadjutors in this business of destruc-
</p>
<p>tion perpetrated the same havoc, for twelve miles
</p>
<p>on the other side : thus filling the country with
</p>
<p>carnage, for twenty-eight miles, and "not leav-
</p>
<p>ing man nor beast alive !" In another part of
</p>
<p>this letter, he informs her of one of his murder-
</p>
<p>ous expeditions, in which he says, " he took no
</p>
<p>account of the slain ; but there was little mercy
</p>
<p>shown in those times." 5 ** What a hideous picture
</p>
<p>of incarnate demons do these horrible facts pre^
</p>
<p>sent to the mind's eye ! And what effrontery
</p>
<p>must not Temple and his followers have possess-
</p>
<p>ed, when they dared to raise such an outcry
</p>
<p>against the Irish, for the crimes which they them-
</p>
<p>selves perpetrated !
</p>
<p>Of all the cases of murderous cruelty that
</p>
<p>marked the career of the government forces in
</p>
<p>Ireland, the most atrocious occurred at the sur-
</p>
<p>render of Drogheda. The history of the Huns,
</p>
<p>Vandals, Goths, and Ostrogoths, or of those
</p>
<p>scourges of the human race, the successors of
</p>
<p>Mahomet, may be searched in vain for any thing
</p>
<p>more shocking. In fact, it is not in the power
</p>
<p>of man, were he possessed by all the furies of the
</p>
<p>Monaghan, and at the taking in of Harry O'Neal's house, in
</p>
<p>the Fews ; insomuch that by this course, and the like acted
</p>
<p>often by the garrison at Drogheda, there was neither man nor
</p>
<p>beast to be found in sixteen miles, between the two towns of
</p>
<p>Drogheda and Dundalk, nor on the other side of Dundalk, in
</p>
<p>the county of Monaghan, nearer than Carrick Mac-Cross, a
</p>
<p>strong pile, twelve miles distant." 5 * 1

</p>
<p>Cromwell had besieged this town for some
</p>
<p>time ; and was finally admitted, on promise of
</p>
<p>quarter. The garrison consisted of the flower of
</p>
<p>the Irish army, and might have beaten him back,
</p>
<p>had they not been seduced by his solemn promise
</p>
<p>of mercy, which was observed till the whole had
</p>
<p>laid down their arms. Then the merciless wretch
</p>
<p>commanded his soldiers to begin a slaughter of
</p>
<p>the entire garrison, which slaughter continued for
</p>
<p>five days ! ! with every circumstance of brutal and
</p>
<p>sanguinary violence that the most cruel savages
</p>
<p>could conceive or perpetrate.*
</p>
<p>" No age was spar'd ; no sex, nay no degree ;

<p>Not infants in the porch of life were free.

<p>impudence to ascribe " the glory" of this bloody
</p>
<p>deed to God, " to whom indeed the praise of this
</p>
<p>mercy belongs ! !"* And such was the delusion
</p>
<p>performed it as long as any place held out ; which encouraged
</p>
<p>others to yield. But when they had once all in their power, and
</p>
<p>feared no hurt that could be done them, Cromwell, being told
</p>
<p>by Jones, that he had now all the flower of the Irish army in his
</p>
<p>hands, gav e orders that no quarter should be given ; so that his
</p>
<p>soldiers were forced, many of them against their -will, to kill
</p>
<p>their prisoners. The brave governor Sir A. Aston, Sir Edm.
</p>
<p>Verney, the colonels Warren, Fleming and Byrne, were killed
</p>
<p>in cold blood; and indeed all the officers, except some few of
</p>
<p>least consideration, that escaped by miracle. The Marquis of
</p>
<p>Ormond, in his letters to the king and lord Byron, says, * that
</p>
<p>on this occasion Cromwell exceeded himself and any thing he
</p>
<p>had ever heard of, in breach of faith and bloody inhumanity ;
</p>
<p>and that the cruelties exercised there, for Jive days after the
</p>
<p>town was taken, -would make as many several pictures of inhu-
</p>
<p>manity, as are to be found in the book of martyrs, or in the re-
</p>
<p>lation of Amboyna? " 543
</p>
<p>* " Sir, -It has pleased God to bless our endeavours at Drog-
</p>
<p>heda ; after battering, we stormed it. The enemy were about
</p>
<p>three thousand strong in the town. They made a stout re-
</p>
<p>sistance, and near one thousand of our men being entered, the
</p>
<p>enemy forced them out again. But God giving a new courage
</p>
<p>to our men, they attempted again, and entered, beating the
</p>
<p>enemy from their defences. The enemy had made three re-
</p>
<p>trenchments, both to the right and left, where we entered, all
</p>
<p>which they were forced to quit : being thus entered, rue refu-
</p>
<p>sed them quarter, having the day before summoned the town.
</p>
<p>I believe we put to the sword the whole number of the defend-
</p>
<p>ents. I do not think thirty of the whole number escaped with
</p>
<p>their lives : those that did are in safe custody, for the Barba-
</p>

<p>of those times, that, in all the churches in Lon-
</p>
<p>don, thanks were returned to the God of mercy,
</p>
<p>for this barbarous slaughter of his creatures !*
</p>
<p>History furnishes no circumstance more dis-
</p>
<p>gusting, revolting, or hideous, than this nauseous
</p>
<p>compound of base perfidy, murderous cruelty,
</p>
<p>and abominable hypocrisy. Never was the throne
</p>
<p>of the Living God more egregiously insulted, than
</p>
<p>by these impious offerings of thanksgiving : and
</p>
<p>never were the thunders of heaven more loudly
</p>
<p>called for, than to blast the Pharisaical wretches
</p>
<p>who made such a mockery of all the calls and
</p>
<p>duties of humanity and religion.
</p>
<p>The enemy being not willing to put an issue upon a field bat-
</p>
<p>tle, had put into this garrison almost all their prime soldiers,
</p>
<p>being about three thousand horse and foot, under the command
</p>
<p>of their best officers, Sir Arthur Ashton being made governour.
</p>
<p>They were some seven or eight regiments, Ormond's being
</p>
<p>one, under the command of Sir Edmund Verney. I do not
</p>
<p>believe, neither do I hear, that any officer escaped -with his life,
</p>
<p>save only one lieutenant, who, I hear, going to the enemy,
</p>
<p>said, that he was the only man that escaped of all the garri-
</p>
<p>son. The enemy were filled upon this with much. terror: and
</p>
<p>truly I believe this bitterness will save much effusion of blood,
</p>
<p>through the goodness of God! ! !
</p>
<p>" I wish that all honest hearts may give the glory of this to
</p>
<p>God alone, to 'whom indeed the praise of this mercy belongs,

<p>NITS WILL BE LICE. 463
</p>
<p>Some time afterwards, Cromwell gained pos-
</p>
<p>session of Wexford, by treachery ; where a car-
</p>
<p>nage was perpetrated, not far inferior to that
</p>
<p>which had taken place at Drogheda.*
</p>
<p>There is an important passage in the preface
</p>
<p>or introduction to Nalson's Collections, which we
</p>
<p>extracted, and intended to quote, but have mis-
</p>
<p>laid. We are therefore obliged to refer to it
</p>
<p>from memory ; as the work has been returned to
</p>
<p>the New York library, whence it was procured,
</p>
<p>and there is no copy in this city. The reverend
</p>
<p>author states, that one of those Herodists, worthy
</p>
<p>disciples of the Idumean, whose deeds are re-
</p>
<p>corded by St. Matthew, having been engaged in
</p>
<p>the humane employment of slaughtering children,
</p>
<p>defended the practice, by saying that " nits would
</p>
<p>be lice." This was an attempt to carry completely
</p>
<p>into operation the horrible plan of extirpating the
</p>
<p>whole race ; the deliberate adoption of which we
</p>
<p>have proved, in a preceding part of this work,
</p>
<p>and which was for some time acted upon by the
</p>
<p>ruling powers. For the accomplishment of this
</p>
<p>grand object, the slaughter of the " lice" that is,
</p>
<p>the full-grown men and women, was not deemed
</p>
<p>* " As soon as Cromwell had ordered his batteries to play on
</p>
<p>a distant quarter of the town, [Wexford] Strafford admitted
</p>
<p>his men into the castle, from whence issuing suddenly, and at-
</p>
<p>tacking the wall and gate adjoining, they were admitted, either
</p>
<p>through the treachery of the townsmen or the cowardice of the
</p>
<p>soldiers, or perhaps both : and the slaughter was almost as
</p>
<p>great as at Drogheda"**

<p>sufficient : the destruction of the " nits" or chil-
</p>
<p>dren, was necessary, to complete the magnificent
</p>
<p>scheme of a new plantation of the kingdom !
</p>
<p>Ireton, apparently sated with slaughter, gave
</p>
<p>protection to the remnant of the inhabitants of a
</p>
<p>certain barony. But " being informed that they
</p>
<p>had broken the articles," he, without inquiry,
</p>
<p>issued orders to slaughter every " man, woman,
</p>
<p>and child" it contained.* Lord Broghill, though
</p>
<p>a sanguinary man, shuddered at the barbarity
</p>
<p>of these terrible orders ; remonstrated with Ire-
</p>
<p>ton ; and at length, with considerable difficulty,
</p>
<p>prevailed on him to confine the massacre to per-
</p>
<p>sons found in arms, or who made resistance.!
</p>
<p>Those who consider the awe which a ferocious
</p>
<p>army inspires, the reluctance which, without the
</p>
<p>most grievous outrage, the peasantry must have
</p>
<p>felt to encounter the swords of a victorious ene-
</p>
<p>my, as well as the violence and rapacity of such
</p>
<p>* " Soon after Ireton had the command of the army, he was
</p>
<p>informed that a certain barony had broken the articles in con-
</p>
<p>sideration of which they had been protected. He marched
</p>
<p>therefore against this barony, and gave immediate orders to his
</p>
<p>soldiers to kill man, woman, and child: but before these orders
</p>
<p>were executed, lord Broghill expostulated with him upon the
</p>
<p>cruelty of such proceedings." 547
</p>
<p>| " He was therefore humbly of opinion, that it would be more
</p>
<p>just, reasonable, and honourable, to order the soldiers to kill
</p>
<p>none but who were found in arms or made any opposition.
</p>
<p>With these words, Ireton -was at last, though hardly, per-
</p>
<p>suaded to revoke his bloody commands"***

<p>an enemy, will be led to believe, that the provo-
</p>
<p>cation was of a similar character with that which,
</p>
<p>according to Phsedrus, was given by the lamb,
</p>

</p>
<p>wolf, who was allaying his thirst above, and who
</p>
<p>charged the innocent animal with muddying the

<p>individual resisted the rape of his wife or daugh-
</p>
<p>ter, or the plunder of his property, and that the
</p>
<p>foiled ruffians magnified the affair into a viola-

<p>tion of the protection. But be that as it may, it
</p>
<p>does not diminish our horror of the merciless
</p>
<p>Ireton, who issued the murderous mandate to
</p>
<p>slaughter " man, woman, and child ;" as it must
</p>
<p>be obvious, that, if there were really a violation
</p>
<p>of the articles, a large portion of the men were
</p>
<p>probably wholly innocent : and, at all events, the
</p>
<p>women, and more especially the children, could
</p>
<p>not have deserved the extermination from which
</p>
<p>they were so hardly rescued.

<p>To the wretched Irish, neither caves, nor cas-

<p>sanguinary lord Orrery, bending down into the

</p>
<p>the claims of the earl of Barrymore and his two
</p>
<p>sons on the speaker of the English House of

<p>Commons, appears to lay his chief dependence
</p>
<p>for success on the desolation they had perpetrated.
</p>
<p>The first, he says, lately hung up "forty-three
</p>
<p>notable rebels for a breakfast."* It is not difficult

<p>to conceive what hideous havoc and carnage the
</p>
<p>constant repetition of these breakfasts, and of
</p>
<p>dinners and suppers of the same character, must
</p>
<p>have produced.
</p>
<p>The merit of the two sons of lord Orrery far
</p>
<p>transcended that of lord Barrymore ; as they, in
</p>
<p>the course of a few months, destroyed above
</p>
<p>three thousand of the Irish.f This afforded them

<p>a sure claim to the favour and protection of go-

<p>Sir William Cole, with one regiment of toot, of

<p>five hundred men, and one troop of horse, is re-
</p>
<p>corded by Borlase to have slain 2,417 swordsmen,

<p>property they had previously plundered, no less

<p>than " 7,000 persons;" 553 and thus, adds he " the

<p>English in ah 1 parts fought, so as indeed the rebels
</p>
<p>lost, in the general, many men, and much of their

<p>stance," and that their enemies were as justly
</p>
<p>celebrated for their skill in plunder as for their
</p>
<p>thirst of blood, is beyond doubt. The following

<p>circumstance will shed additional light on this

<p>subject.
</p>
<p>Sir Richard Cox, in the subsequent war be-

<p>three thousand of the Irish ;* made preys to the

<p>could seldom sting ; having, as I believe, killed and hanged
</p>
<p>not less than three thousand of them, whilst I stayed in the

<p>county of Cork ; and taken from them, in cattle and plunder, at
</p>
<p>least to the value of 12,000/. which you will easily believe,

<p>The horrible scenes we have depicted were not
</p>
<p>confined to Ireland. The war was carried on, in
</p>
<p>England and Scotland, with similar rapine, deso-
</p>
<p>lation, and carnage on both sides, royalist and
</p>
<p>republican. It is not necessary, nor would it be
</p>
<p>proper, to enter here into detail respecting the
</p>
<p>affairs of the sister island. A few instances will
</p>
<p>be sufficient for our present purpose, merely to
</p>
<p>display the spirit of the age, the humanity of its
</p>
<p>warfare, and the peculiar propriety of the eternal
</p>
<p>reproaches, with which " the welkin has rung,"
</p>
<p>against the barbarity of the Irish.

<p>Lord Clarendon, in various parts of his history,
</p>
<p>narrates the ruthless ferocity that reigned in battle
</p>
<p>and after defeat, when neither age nor sex was
</p>
<p>spared. In particular, he states, that, in the pur-

<p>suit of the royalists, after the battle of Edgehill,
</p>
<p>there were about one hundred women slaughter-
</p>
<p>ed, and among them the wives of some of the

<p>officers.*
</p>
<p>According to Burnet, prisoners were slaugh-

<p>the preachers, from the pulpit, deprecated the

<p>extension of mercy towards them, and denounced

<p>all those who were for moderate measures.f

</p>
<p>Montross, in Scotland, anno 1644, which may
</p>
<p>stand a parallel with the murderous exploits of

</p>
<p>The government forces in Ulster had commit-

<p>ted some frightful massacres on the Irish, of which
</p>
<p>an account was published in London. The House
</p>
<p>of Commons, which was actuated by the most

<p>rancorous spirit of hostility towards the Irish,
</p>
<p>took the alarm. They had the printers committed

<p>and directed the Stationers' Company to seize all

<p>it was not by any means through the force of
</p>
<p>English skill or English valour, though both were
</p>
<p>of the highest grade at that period, that they
</p>
<p>achieved the conquest. They had at all times in
</p>
<p>their armies hosts of traitorous Frenchmen, who
</p>
<p>paved the way for the conquest and slavery of
</p>
<p>their country. Such, too, was the Roman policy,
</p>
<p>such the means whereby that all-grasping and
</p>
<p>devastating government extended its empire over
</p>
<p>the then known world.
</p>
<p>But the case of Ireland is probably among the
</p>
<p>most forcible illustrations of this maxim that his-

<p>for centuries existed there, who have bartered

<p>their country's dearest rights and interests, for the

<p>privilege of trampling down their countrymen,

</p>
<p>Whenever an attempt has been made to shake

<p>off the yoke of foreign power, to emancipate the

<p>nation, this oligarchy has always had its spies,

<p>This odious and oppressive system was about

<p>not devised some new penalty, some new forfei-

<p>most valuable volume now before us, of above
</p>
<p>three hundred and fifty pages, which contains a
</p>
<p>detail of those disqualifications, and is wholly
</p>
<p>confined to that subject. It was our intention to
</p>
<p>have given a sketch of them ; but our limits for-
</p>
<p>bid the fulfilment of this purpose.
</p>
<p>Various causes conspired to produce the salutary
</p>
<p>effect of mitigating the severity of this vile code.
</p>
<p>The first stroke it received arose from the spirit
</p>
<p>of volunteering in Ireland, which was the con-
</p>
<p>sequence of the declared inability of the British
</p>
<p>government to protect that country, during the
</p>
<p>war against the United States, France, Spain, and
</p>
<p>Holland. Every description of religionists mixed
</p>
<p>ill the ranks of the volunteers, which gave rise ta
</p>
<p>an enlarged and liberal spirit of national feeling.
</p>
<p>The Irish Catholic and the Irish Protestant, as well
</p>
<p>as the Protestant dissenter, were amalgamated
</p>
<p>into one common mass of friends to their com-
</p>
<p>mon country. Many links of the chains of the
</p>
<p>nation at large, as well as of the proscribed Ca-
</p>
<p>tholics, were then knocked off. The increasing
</p>
<p>liberality of the age has successively removed
</p>
<p>others. But it is disgraceful and dishonourable,
</p>
<p>that much remains vet to be done.
</p>
<p>It may be thought a work of supererogation, at
</p>
<p>this time, to revive the remembrance of a code so
</p>
<p>odious, so detestable, and so infamous. But this
</p>
<p>work would be very incomplete, and the reader
</p>
<p>would have a very imperfect idea of the state of

<p>not give some sketch of this system.
</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of pages have been
</p>
<p>written and printed, in discussing the question,
</p>
<p>Who and what is Antichrist, the beast with seven
</p>
<p>heads and ten horns ? Various solutions have
</p>
<p>been given to the world. We are not very learned

</p>
<p>we have made the discovery, which we, freely
</p>
<p>communicate : we are convinced that religious
</p>
<p>persecution is the real and genuine Antichrist.
</p>
<p>There is nothing of the wickedness of man so
</p>
<p>opposite to the spirit displayed in the words and
</p>
<p>actions of Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p>Antichrist obtained a glorious triumph over
</p>
<p>the spirit of Jesus, when the Inquisition was es-
</p>
<p>tablished at Madrid, at Lisbon, at Goa, and else-
</p>
<p>where : and his reign has been coeval with the

<p>existence of those execrable tribunals. He reign-

</p>
<p>Nothing, however, but gross ignorance and
</p>
<p>bigotry, can suppose that the reign of the Anti-
</p>
<p>christ of persecution has been confined to Madrid,
</p>
<p>Lisbon, Goa, Paris, or the other places usually
</p>
<p>allotted to him. The most superficial glance at
</p>
<p>history must evince the egregious folly of such
</p>
<p>an opinion. Antichrist reigned in Geneva, when
</p>
<p>Calvin sanctioned the death of Servetus ; in Lon-
</p>
<p>don, when Henry VIII. and Elizabeth erected
</p>
<p>their gibbets, to immolate those opposed to their
</p>
<p>opinions; in Scotland, when the Covenanters
</p>
<p>were shot down in the tields ; in Holland, when
</p>
<p>the Remonstrants were plundered, and banished,
</p>
<p>and immolated, for their dissent from the esta-
</p>
<p>blished creed ; in Boston, when the Quakers
</p>
<p>were persecuted and hanged ; and he exercised
</p>
<p>a most rigorous sway in Ireland, for above a cen-
</p>
<p>tury, during the operation of the barbarous code
</p>
<p>" to prevent the growth of Popery."
</p>
<p>We stand pledged to trace, at a future day, the
</p>
<p>progress of Antichrist in various parts of Chris-
</p>
<p>tendom.* At present, the nature of this work
</p>
<p>confines us to his proceedings in Ireland.
</p>
<p>We assume this position as undeniable :
</p>
<p>Every man has a sacred and indefeasible right
</p>
<p>to worship God according to his judgment, pro-
</p>
<p>vided such worship do not tend to any breach of
</p>
<p>the fundamental laws of morality. Corollaries

</p>
<p>ported shall return again into this kingdom, then to be guilty

<p>of high treason, and to suffer accordingly"^

<p>discovering to any two justices that a Roman
</p>
<p>Catholic had a horse of that value, might, with a
</p>
<p>constable and assistant, break open any door;
</p>
<p>seize such horse ; bring him before the justices ;
</p>
<p>and, on paying five pounds five shillings, have
</p>
<p>the property of such horse, "as if bought in
</p>
<p>market overt."*
</p>
<p>Any person concealing such horse, was liable
</p>
<p>to be imprisoned three months, and pay treble
</p>
<p>the value. 570
</p>
<p>Civil officers were authorized to seize the
</p>
<p>horses of Roman Catholics, on certain contingen-

<p>same had been bought and sold in market overt." 572
</p>
<p>* This clause had nearly proved fatal to a rascal who took
</p>
<p>advantage of it, about forty years since. He forcibly seized
</p>
<p>a horse, saddled and bridled, belonging to a Roman Catholic.
</p>
<p>But, though the law sanctioned the robbery of horses, it did
</p>
<p>not authorize that of saddles and bridles. The felon was
</p>
<p>prosecuted for the plunder of the harness, and narrowly
</p>
<p>escaped the gallows, which he so richly deserved. One other
</p>
<p>circumstance, arising from this law, may merit attention. A
</p>
<p>Catholic, who owned one of the most celebrated racers in Ire-
</p>
<p>land, worth two hundred guineas, being informed that a person
</p>
<p>was about to seize him, and pay him the price fixed by law,
</p>
<p>mounted the horse, and presented him to a Protestant friend ;
</p>
<p>thus defeating the miscreant of his vile purpose.

</p>
<p>and barbarize those Helots, to plunge them into
</p>
<p>the abysses of Cimmerian darkness, they were,
</p>
<p>at one stroke, cut off from education. The law

<p>punished the man who
</p>
<p>" Taught the young idea how to shoot,"

<p>who assisted to remove that brutal ignorance

<p>which prepares the mind for every species of

<p>The eternal laws of humanity, imprinted on
</p>
<p>our hearts by our great Creator, command sympa-
</p>
<p>thy for our suffering fellow creatures, and, when
</p>
<p>in our power, the extension of relief to their
</p>
<p>miseries. The rudest savages are not insensible
</p>
<p>to the sway of this universal and sovereign law.
</p>
<p>They share their slender pittance with the dis-
</p>
<p>tressed and suffering stranger. Christ Jesus him-
</p>
<p>self, in the most emphatical language he ever
</p>
<p>used, in " words that burn," denounces " ever-
</p>
<p>lasting fire" against those who refuse obedience
</p>
<p>to this law :

<p>'V-l'Ifc- \htQi-iLt '>i r i
</p>
<p>" Depart from me, ye Cursed ! into everlasting fire, prepared
</p>
<p>for the devil and his angels ! for I was an hungered, and ye
</p>
<p>gave me no meat : I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink : I
</p>
<p>was a stranger, and ye took me not in ; naked, and ye clothed
</p>
<p>me not ; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not."
</p>
<p>This divine lesson the impious and barbarous
</p>
<p>Irish legislature, with a wicked hypocrisy, which
</p>
<p>enhanced the atrocity of the deed, trampled under
</p>
<p>foot, under pretence of propagating, in its utmost
</p>
<p>purity, the religion of that Jesus Christ, of whose
</p>
<p>precepts and maxims their laws were an undevi-

<p>Throughout the whole habitable globe, even

<p>ROB YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER. 501
</p>
<p>Irish legislators pretended to spread, renewed
</p>
<p>and enforced the command,
</p>
<p>u Honour thy father and thy mother." 593
</p>
<p>But what was the dictate of the hideous code " to
</p>
<p>prevent the growth of Popery ?" Did it support
</p>
<p>or countenance the observance of this holy law of
</p>
<p>Moses and of Jesus Christ ? No : it said, in lan-
</p>
<p>guage fit for pirates and robbers, Forswear your
</p>
<p>religion, and then you have legal sanction to
</p>
<p>plunder your father and mother, and bring their
</p>
<p>gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.* In return
</p>
<p>for all their cares, their solicitudes, their pains,
</p>
<p>their affection, strip them of that property which
</p>
<p>ought to support your brothers and sisters. This
</p>
<p>was the unequivocal spirit of Irish legislation, on
</p>
<p>the subject of filial duty.
</p>
<p>When any child or children of any Roman Ca-
</p>
<p>tholic, other than the eldest son, whose case was
</p>
<p>provided for before, conformed to the Protestant
</p>
<p>religion, the father was obliged to give in, upon
</p>
<p>oath, to the court of chancery, a statement of the
</p>
<p>real and bona fide value of all his estate, real and
</p>
<p>personal ; and make such provision for the pre-
</p>
<p>* "The eldest son, so conforming, immediately acquires, and
</p>
<p>in the life time of his father, the permanent part, what our law
</p>
<p>calls the reversion and inheritance of the estate, and he dis-
</p>
<p>charges it by retrospect ; and annuls every sort of voluntary
</p>
<p>settlement made by the father ever so long before his conver-
</p>
<p>sion. This he may sell or dispose of immediately, and alienate
</p>
<p>it from the family for ever." 5 * 4

</p>
<p>Of this code of laws, it may be fairly averred,
</p>
<p>that, had all the penitentiaries in Europe been
</p>
<p>ransacked, to form a legislature for Ireland, had
</p>
<p>Cartouche and his gang taken possession of the
</p>
<p>Parliament-house, they could not have devised a
</p>
<p>more rapacious or cruel system.
</p>
<p>There is hardly a code in the world, that does
</p>
<p>not afford some instances of unjust and immoral
</p>
<p>laws, enacted in moments of delusion or faction.
</p>
<p>But this; is the only one universally and undevi-
</p>
<p>atingly profligate and depraved, of which every
</p>
<p>provision and paragraph violated some law of
</p>
<p>God or man, and the plainest dictates of eternal
</p>
<p>justice, and which legalized robbery, and punish-
</p>
<p>ed with death acts of humanity, teaching schools,
</p>
<p>the celebration of marriage, c. fyc.
</p>
<p>The professed object of the hypocritical tyrants
</p>
<p>who framed this " ferocious system," as Burke ap-
</p>
<p>propriately styles it, was to rescue the objects of
</p>
<p>its rapacity from the darkness of Popish idolatry.
</p>
<p>But they might worship Jupiter Ammon, Juno,
</p>
<p>Venus, Mars, Bacchus, and Apollo, with the Ro-
</p>
<p>mans ; the sun, with the Guebres ; or Apis, with
</p>
<p>the Egyptians ; they might even disbelieve in God
</p>
<p>altogether.* Provided they forswore transub-
</p>
<p>stantiation and the Pope's authority, they became
</p>
<p>pure and immaculate ; their property and persons

<p>were secure ; and, under the forms and ceremo-
</p>
<p>nies of the law of the land, they then acquired
</p>
<p>a right to rob and plunder the blind idolatrous
</p>
<p>Papists whom they had abandoned.
</p>
<p>Whoever has travelled through these pages,
</p>
<p>and duly considered the villany of those statutes,
</p>
<p>and of the legislators by whom they were enacted;
</p>
<p>the horrible scenes of oppression, fraud, and mur-
</p>
<p>der, which they could not fail to produce ; the
</p>
<p>universal demoralization that must have followed
</p>
<p>their operation, cannot fail to agree with Tillot-
</p>
<p>son, that, so far as respected the devoted island
</p>
<p>whose fate we deplore, it were
</p>
<p>" Better there we're no revealed religion, and that human
</p>
<p>nature were left to the conduct of its own principles and incli-
</p>
<p>nations, which are much more mild and merciful, much more
</p>
<p>for the peace and happiness of human society, than to be actu-
</p>
<p>ated by a religion that inspires men with so vile a Jury, and
</p>
<p>prompts them to commit such outrages.' 1 '' 596
</p>
<p>Tillotson applied this strong position to other
</p>
<p>parts of Christendom ; but shut his eyes to the
</p>
<p>wickedness, the profligacy, and the immorality of
</p>
<p>the code in force in his native country;* so
</p>
<p>much easier is it to take the mote out of our
</p>
<p>neighbour's eye, than the beam out of our own. *
</p>
<p>We have now, however, in this enlightened
</p>
<p>country, bigoted clergymen, who cant, and whine,
</p>
<p>and turn up the whites of their eyes, deploring
</p>
<p>* The English laws on this subject were as wicked and
</p>
<p>cruel as the Iribh.

<p>ADVERTISEMENT
</p>
<p>TO THE FIRST AMERICAN EDITION.
</p>
<p>The writer of this publication IMS consulted three or four small works, written on
</p>
<p>the same subject, particularly a valuable one, " Hints to Emigrants," written, he
</p>
<p>believes, by Dr. Mac Neven ; and has availed himself of such matter as they con-
</p>
<p>tained, likely to answer the important purpose he had in view. He has likewise con-
</p>
<p>sulted several intelligent friends, who have enabled him to correct some mistakes, into
</p>
<p>which he had inadvertently falkn. But all his care and attention may have been
</p>
<p>insufficient to secure him from error ; and as errors in this case might lead estimable
</p>
<p>men into irretrievable losses and difficulties, he has determined to print but one hun-
</p>
<p>dred copies of this edition, and to distribute them gratuitously among citizens whose
</p>
<p>experience and knowledge may enable them to decide accurately on the subject, and
</p>
<p>whom he hereby respectfully solicits to communicate such errors as they
</p>
<p>or such additional information as they may judge necessary to complet
</p>
<p>developing the inducements to immigration into this country.
</p>
<p>To all such communications he pledges himself to pay due attention, and to decide
</p>
<p>on them according to his most mature judgment, but by no means to copy them ser-
</p>
<p>vikly, contrary to that judgment.

<p>ADDRESS
</p>
<p>OF THE
</p>
<p>PUBLISHERS OF THIS (THE ENGLISH) EDITION.
</p>
<p>WE have singular pleasure in laying this pampJdet before the British public.
</p>
<p>We have frequently felt reluctant to offer any advice of our own respecting Emigra-
</p>
<p>tion ; and many of the works me have read on the subject have evidently been dictated
</p>
<p>by very partial feelings, or have been put forth by ignorant bookmakers, as Peter
</p>
<p>Pindar's pedlar hawked about hi razors, which were not intended for use, but for
</p>
<p>sale. Advice on such a subject, unless it flow from the best sources, may lead to
</p>
<p>most ruinous consequences : like the frolic of the boys with the frogs, in the f able, it
</p>
<p>may be sport for one party, but death to the other. The American publication, how-
</p>
<p>ever, which me have here reprinted, appears to us to be a fair, and, indeed, interesting
</p>
<p>statement of both sides of the important question of emigration ; the best motives
</p>
<p>appear to have actuated its author ; and me feel conscious of endeavouring to dis-
</p>
<p>charge a pulilic duty, in extending its circulation into our native country.
</p>
<p>Admiring, as me do, the candour with which the able and experienced author has
</p>
<p>given his opinions to the public, and appreciating most higldy the value of the
</p>
<p>information he has afforded, me ^do not feel any necessity to detain the reader long
</p>
<p>from the perusal of the work; but we cannot refrain from noticing one or two
</p>
<p>points on which a difference of opinion may exist, without at all affecting the general
</p>
<p>question ; and offering some advice on matters of a local nature, wliich may be
</p>
<p>useful to the emigrant before lie quits these shores.
</p>
<p>It will be observed, that the author ascribes the distresses of our industrious and
</p>
<p>skilful countrymen, principally, to the increase of machinery, and brings, in aid of
</p>
<p>his opinion, a statement of the gradual increase of tlie poor-rates during the
</p>
<p>period of the gradual increase of mechanical power. We are not convinced of the
</p>
<p>applicability of the illustration. We should rather ascribe tlie privations of the
</p>
<p>British people to tlie increase of taxation ; and, in contemplating the growth of the
</p>
<p>national debt and the enomutus extension of the civil, military, and ecclesiastical
</p>
<p>establishments of the country, we should refer not only to the gradual increase of the
</p>
<p>poor-rates, but to a correspondent increase of crime, as the proofs of our position :
</p>
<p>such lamentable increase having taken place, notwithstanding the exertion of the
</p>
<p>immense mechanical, in addition to tlie natural, power of the people ; for we hold,
</p>
<p>that in the absence of taxation, or of any similar means by which property is taken
</p>

</p>
<p>from the producer, without giving him an equivalent, all productive power would
</p>
<p>alike contribute to increase the wealth of the community at large ; so that the addi-
</p>
<p>tion of mechanical to muscular power would, instead of being an evil, be an auxiliary
</p>
<p>source of good. All revenue is derived from labour, and the actual producer of
</p>
<p>value, however humbly employed, pays the grtater portion of the revenue, either in
</p>
<p>direct or indirect taxes, or in the prici of his bread. If then ive imagine, even in
</p>
<p>the present state of the country, that the laljourer shall henciforth have the neces-
</p>
<p>saries of life free from tlte effects of "taxation ; in other words, if we suppose that
</p>
<p>from this time that portion of the revenue which he pays shall remain at his on-n
</p>
<p>disposal, it is not difficult to see that such a change would afford instant employ-
</p>
<p>ment to all who sought it, for it would enable millions, who are now not half fed,
</p>
<p>nor Italf clothed, to become the best customers to farmers and manufacturers.
</p>
<p>The people, in fact, would be customers to each otlter, for they would litv well and
</p>
<p>dress well. At present the Debt, tlte State, and tlte Church deprive than of the
</p>
<p>means.
</p>
<p>It is the opinion of the author, that, when a population becomes excessive, those
</p>
<p>who emigrate confer a benefit on tlutse who remain; and in this doctrint; taken in
</p>
<p>the abstract, we perfectly agree : but when it is urged as an argument for emigration
</p>
<p>from any particular country, me must be careful that the pninises wist before nx
</p>
<p>ad upon the conclusion. In Great Britain, for instance, it may be said, that an
</p>
<p>excess of population renders emigration dtsh atAe ; but n-e suspect the fact tube, that
</p>
<p>an excess of unprodiu-tive consumers, living <m the labour of the productive, (tcfio
</p>
<p>are thereby deprived of many of the comforts <>J life,) oecanum* the appearance of a
</p>
<p>Kupo-dbuittlanl, because distressed, ]H>i>itl<ttion. To us it w ciidatf, that n niiiyni
</p>
<p>iv ADDRESS.
</p>
<p>tion be resorted to, for the relief of those who remain, it ought to be confined to the
</p>
<p>innumerable idle and expensive persons who, in this country, give no value for the
</p>
<p>abundance of good things which they derive from an industrious but abused people,
</p>
<p>and for which, in any other country under heaven, they would be obliged to work.
</p>
<p>If these would only depart, leaving tJie produce to the producers, we should hear no
</p>
<p>more of excessive population. As it is, those who have emigrated during some years
</p>
<p>past, and those who are likely to emigrate in years to come, are precisely the persons
</p>
<p>who can produce, and have produced, more valuables than they have consumed ; who
</p>
<p>have contributed to the common stock ; who have borne a share of those state burdens
</p>
<p>which have pressed, and still press heavily, on every industrious shoulder ; and
</p>
<p>whose departure, therefore, from under the load, will leave fewer such shoulders to
</p>
<p>bear its comparatively severer pressure. Emigration, we contend, of such people,
</p>
<p>from such a country, cannot be an advantage, but directly the contrary, to those who
</p>
<p>remain. The honest and hard-working man, however, who finds the labour of his
</p>
<p>hands and the skill of his head insufficiently requited, and who is anxious, out of
</p>
<p>the natural fruits of his industry, to keep for himself and his family something
</p>
<p>more than a bare subsistence, cannot be expected to be bound by this consideration
</p>
<p>for those who remain. Love of country, attachment to neighbours and friends,
</p>
<p>will induce him to try, for a sufficient length of time, every means of securing his
</p>
<p>own prosperity in his native land ; but he feels that his duty to himself and his
</p>
<p>family is paramount to all other obligations, and he looks around him, not for a
</p>
<p>land of better promise, (that would be difficult to find,) but for a government which
</p>
<p>would make fcss demand upon him.
</p>
<p>With the exception of the two points upon which we have offered the foregoing
</p>
<p>observations to the consideration of the reader, we consider the opinions of the author
</p>
<p>of the pamphlet extremely sound, and calculated to render much benefit to those who
</p>
<p>are ever so remotely contemplating the subject of emigration ; and we commit the
</p>
<p>work to the perusal of our countrymen, as a guide upon which we believe they may
</p>
<p>rely.
</p>
<p>We cannot conclude, without giving a caution to all those who decide upon going
</p>
<p>abroad, to beware of the numerous impositions practised upon unsuspecting strangers,
</p>
<p>on their arrival for the purpose of embarkation, in the outports of this country.

<p>to have some knowledge of the places whence they come and whither they are

</p>
<p>kindly services in managing their outfit, securing them a passage, fyc. fyc. and such

<p>the Liverpool Mercury during the last twelve years, and many convictions of the

<p>actors in them have taken place ; still, however, such frauds continue to be practised,

<p>and me have no reason to suppose that they are confined to one port.
</p>
<p>Some time ago, the American Chamber of J Commerce in Liverpool established a

<p>Passengers' Office, under the management of a respectable agent, for the purpose of

<p>affording information to emigrants, and of preventing impositions upon them.
</p>
<p>We, therefore, adtrise all persons going by way of this town to America, to apply to
</p>
<p>Mr. FITZHUGH, at the Office, No. 11, BROOKS'-SQDARE, near the Custom-house,
</p>
<p>where they may not only engage a passage on i)te best terms, and by the best vessels,
</p>
<p>but may obtain the most correct information as to laying in, their sea stores and

<p>ought to induce them to swerve ; and in purchasing their outfit, tiiey ought to apply
</p>
<p>to tJie most respectable tradesmen, whose names tlisy can only learn with certainty

<p>from persons of known reputation. In other outports, as well as here, the rule to
</p>
<p>be uniformly observed is TRUST NOT TO APPEARANCES, NOR TO THE PRETENCES

<p>OF STRANGERS, BUT SEEK INFORMATION AT THE BEST AND PUBLICLY KNOWN

</p>
<p>THE following pages are respectfully submitted to the consideration
</p>
<p>of such of the inhabitants of Europe as find themselves crowded
</p>
<p>by exuberant population, and contemplate trying their fortunes in
</p>
<p>foreign countries. They contain a naked, unvarnished tale of the
</p>
<p>situation of a country blest with every variety of soil, climate,
</p>
<p>and agricultural and mineral productions intersected by most
</p>
<p>magnificent rivers and with a sea-coast 5,000 miles in extent
</p>
<p>a country which, two hundred years ago, was a mere desert
</p>
<p>which, fifty years ago, contained only about 2,500,000 of souls,
</p>
<p>and was in a state of colonial dependence on the most powerful
</p>
<p>nation in Europe but which now contains twenty-four distinct
</p>
<p>sovereignties, and 12,000, 000 souls is thesecondmaritimeand com-
</p>
<p>mercial power in the world, and enjoys the freest government that
</p>
<p>ever existed, a country, in fine, which only requires a sound po-
</p>
<p>licy to elevate it gradually to the highest rank among the nations
</p>
<p>of the earth.
</p>
<p>I have been induced to undertake this publication in the hope
</p>
<p>of rendering essential service on both sides of the Atlantic. This
</p>
<p>hope has been sufficient incentive. Should it be realized, the re-
</p>
<p>sult will be abundant reward. But sanguine temperaments are
</p>
<p>liable to frequent disappointments. I may, therefore, be wholly
</p>
<p>deceived in my expectations, as this essay ma)' fall still-born from
</p>
<p>the press. The intention, in that case, will, it is presumable, plead
</p>
<p>an apology for the unnecessary intrusion on the public eye.
</p>
<p>My object is two-fold ; it is not merely to point out the descrip-
</p>
<p>tion of persons to whom emigration to this country would be ad-
</p>
<p>vantageous, but also to hold out a beacon to those to whom it
</p>
<p>would be unadvisable to remove hither. Many a man in comfort-
</p>
<p>able circumstances in Europe, allured by golden dreams, has ship-
</p>
<p>wrecked his fortunes by change of hemisphere.
</p>
<p>While the United States have the capacity* of maintaining hun-
</p>
<p>* It is a remarkable circumstance, that, notwithstanding this capacity, such is the effect
</p>
<p>of our wayward policy, that almost every avocation or pursuit in this country is crowded.

<p>dreds of millions of inhabitants beyond their present numbers, that
</p>
<p>is to say, 1 repeat, under a st%ind policy, Great Britain and Ireland,
</p>
<p>and many c^her parts of Europe, are groaning under a super-
</p>
<p>abundant population, whose condition, in various countries, is
</p>
<p>gradually deteriorating, by the increasing competition for em-
</p>
<p>ployment. It is not a very overstrained figure to say, that they
</p>
<p>are literally devouring each other. Is it not, therefore, highly
</p>
<p>desirable that such an understanding should prevail on the subject,
</p>
<p>as will enable one country to part with what it can so advanta-
</p>
<p>geously spare, and another to receive that of which it is in want,
</p>
<p>and which it can, of course, so advantageously receive? Not
</p>
<p>only would the condition of those emigrating, but of those who
</p>
<p>remained behind, be improved. Every hundred or thousand per-
</p>
<p>sons who emigrate from an overstocked country, increase the
</p>
<p>value of the labour, and improve the prospect of happiness of
</p>
<p>those who remain. To produce this happy result is the object of
</p>
<p>this publication.
</p>
<p>Great Britain incurs great expense in promoting emigration from
</p>
<p>Ireland to the Cape of Good Hope and to Canada, in order to
</p>
<p>lessen the population of tfiat ill-fated country. It would be a
</p>
<p>national benefit, therefore, to the British Government to make an
</p>
<p>opening for distressed Irish in this country, and thus save it from
</p>
<p>the expense of their removal.
</p>
<p>The superabundance of the unemployed population of Ireland
</p>
<p>arises from the ruinous policy of the Government, and the extra-
</p>
<p>vagant drains of the national wealth, by the absentees, being no
</p>
<p>less than 13,500,000 dollars per annum. The same effect is pro-
</p>
<p>duced in Great Britain by the wonderful improvement of machi-
</p>
<p>nery, which supersedes the labour of the working classes, reduces
</p>
<p>their wages, in many cases, to the minimum of the support of a
</p>
<p>mere existence ; and in some, even below that wretched modicum,
</p>
<p>thus sinking a large proportion of them into the degraded state of
</p>
<p>paupers.

<p>Some of our political economists are loud and unqualified in
</p>
<p>their praise of mechanical improvements, as tending to increase
</p>
<p>national wealth and resources. To a certain extent, and under
</p>
<p>certain limitations, this doctrine is perfectly correct. That they
</p>
<p>have that tendency cannot be denied. But, alas! how dear the
</p>
<p>purchase, under particular circumstances! What masses of misery
</p>
<p>have they not produced in Great Britain ! They have sunk into
</p>
<p>abasement an important part of the population, and quadrupled
</p>
<p>the paupers of that country, whose numbers have regularly in-
</p>
<p>creased in proportion to the improvement of machinery. The
</p>
<p>friends of humanity will have no difficulty in deciding the question
</p>
<p>between the advantages and disadvantages of a system producing
</p>
<p>such deleterious effects.* Can any increase of national wealth
</p>
<p>I should deeply regret were it supposed, from the passage in the text, that I entertain
</p>
<p>the heterodoxlcal opinion, that improvements in labour-saving machinery are, on the
</p>
<p>whole, pernicious. Far from it. They are, generally, indeed almost universally ,|salutary.
</p>
<p>In fact, were consumption to keep pace with the power of production, they would be uni-
</p>
<p>versally *o. But, as the best things in the world ma/become pernicious by abuse or ex-

<p>and resources compensate for the degradation and misery of pro-
</p>
<p>bably ten to fifteen per cent, of the entire population of a nation?
</p>
<p>If the true art of government, and the duty of governors, be to
</p>
<p>produce the greatest happiness of the greatest number of the go-
</p>
<p>verned, then the extraordinary extent of the so-much-lauded im-
</p>
<p>provements in machinery, is any thing but a blessing to a country
</p>
<p>with a crowded population, especially when there is a difficulty of
</p>
<p>egress. If, however, that portion of the population, who, by ma-
</p>
<p>chinery, are deprived of work their only means of procuring
</p>
<p>subsistence, be enabled to find other employment or to withdraw
</p>
<p>to other countries, then the improvement produces nothing but
</p>
<p>unmixed good. Under a wise policy for the protection of national
</p>
<p>industry, such as is pursued by all the prosperous nations of
</p>
<p>Europe, securing a steady home market as far as possible to the
</p>
<p>agricultural citizens, countries like the United States, with a po-
</p>
<p>pulation small in proportion to their extent, with vast bodies of
</p>
<p>uncultivated lands, labour dear, and land cheap, would derive im-
</p>
<p>mense advantages from improvements in machinery. Why ? The
</p>
<p>reason is obvious. Because the manufacturers, deprived of em-
</p>
<p>ployment, could readily devote themselves to the cultivation of the
</p>
<p>soil, and thus preserve a proper proportion between supply and
</p>
<p>demand.
</p>
<p>It cannot fail to be useful to display the effects of the improve-
</p>
<p>ments in question, by facts of the most conclusive character.
</p>
<p>cess, so the prodigious improvements in machinery, whenever, by depriving large bodies of
</p>
<p>people of employment, they reduce them to wretchedness and beggary, are a public nui-
</p>
<p>sance, and frequently operate as perniciously on the interests of the employers as the
</p>
<p>employed. This is strongly exemplified in Great Britain, at present, in the cotton trade.
</p>
<p>Production, in consequence of its extraordinary facility, outruns consumption and hence
</p>
<p>all the markets in the world, open to the reception of British cotton fabrics, are almost
</p>
<p>constantly glutted with them and the prices are, consequently, reduced below a proper
</p>
<p>remuneration. Remittances fail. Production is then diminished. Distress and desola-

<p>tion spread through the working classes, and the wretched journeymen are thrown on the
</p>
<p>overseers of the poor for support. If this state of things be a blessing, then the extreme
</p>
<p>improvements of labour-saving machinery are a blessing of the first order, and cannot be
</p>
<p>carried too far. But, " there's tb rub." The following summary view of the state of
</p>
<p>the cotton manufacturers, at the date of late advices from Liverpool, extracted from the
</p>
<p>National Gazette of May 22nd, 1826, affords a full confirmation of these doctrines, however
</p>
<p>repugnant they may appear to, and however strongly they may be condemned by, the-
</p>
<p>oretical political economists.

</p>
<p>" inevitable result of those embarrassments, are, indeed, melancholy. Letters received

<p>'in London on the 18th ult. from Manchester, carried intelligence of the re-appearance of
</p>
<p>" distress in that place. Between 40 and 50,000 persons were out of employment, and
</p>
<p>" many almost in a state of starvation. The want of orders by the manufacturers was

<p>" assigned as the cause of the unfortunate recurrence of these distressing events. Unex-
</p>

<p>The reduction in 1822-23 probably arose from the great reduc-
</p>
<p>tion of the prices of provisions.
</p>
<p>That this frightful increase of pauperism and misery, and of
</p>
<p>poor rates, is the result of the increase and improvement of ma-
</p>
<p>chinery, cannot, I think, for a moment, be questioned. It is as-
</p>
<p>serted that the machinery at present in use in Great Britain, pro-
</p>
<p>duces as much manufactures as would require above 200,000.000
</p>
<p>of people to execute. The obvious effects of this astonishing
</p>
<p>productiveness are, I repeat, to diminish the demand for manual
</p>
<p>labour increase the competition among the labouring classes
</p>
<p>force them to underbid each other reduce the rate of their wages
</p>
<p>and thus entail on them distress and misery.
</p>
<p>In order Co show the effect of the increase of machinery on the
</p>
<p>wages of those employed in the departments of industry in which
</p>
<p>it is most extensively used, I annex the following extracts from
</p>
<p>Tooke's " Thoughts on High and Low Prices." I regret that his
</p>
<p>tables extend no further back than to 1810, as there is every
</p>
<p>reason to suppose that the previous reductions were still greater
</p>
<p>than those subsequent to that period. His tables close with the

<p>they are at present I have no means of ascertaining. Carpenters,
</p>
<p>whose wages in 1810 were 20s., received 30s. in 1820.
</p>
<p>I have, in a great degree, confined my views to the state of Penn-
</p>
<p>sylvania, but by no means wish it understood that this state ought
</p>
<p>to attract the attention of emigrants exclusively. New York has
</p>
<p>great advantages, and, of course, holds out corresponding encou-
</p>
<p>ragement. The difference, however, is not very material between
</p>
<p>the two states ; and most of the observations made with respect to
</p>
<p>the one, apply with little variation to the other. The greatness of
</p>
<p>the capital of New York must rest chiefly on the basis of com-
</p>
<p>merce ; while Philadelphia, although- advantag eously situated for
</p>
<p>commerce, and owning vessels in the foreign tra !e to the amount
</p>
<p>of 62,610 tons, and in the coasting trade, to the amount of 27,556
</p>
<p>tons, is more devoted to manufactures than to commerce, and
</p>
<p>must rest her hopes of a high degree of prosperity mainly on the
</p>
<p>former.
</p>
<p>Dr. Franklin truly stated that " this was a country of labour.'*
</p>
<p>And it has undergone no alteration since the days of that illustri-
</p>
<p>ous philosopher. Let no man, therefore, whether farmer, me-
</p>
<p>chanic, manufacturer, or labourer, delude himself into the opinion
</p>
<p>that by immigration into the United States he can dispense with
</p>
<p>labour. Nothing can be more erroneous.
</p>
<p>Let it, however, be observed, as a source of consolation to those
</p>
<p>descriptions of persons who are more particularly wanted in the
</p>
<p>United States, that there is probably no country where the same
</p>
<p>degree of comfort and enjoyment can be procured by the working
</p>
<p>classes, with the same degree of exertion. For two days' labour,
</p>
<p>at twelve hours per day, a journeyman at most of the trades car-
</p>
<p>ried on in Philadelphia or New York, can procure wholesome, sub-
</p>
<p>stantial food in sufficient abundance, flesh meat of good quality
</p>
<p>included, for one week. Is there any other country under the
</p>
<p>canopy of heaven, of which the same statement can be made to

<p>the same extent, and with equal truth ? However, let me repeat
</p>
<p>in the most forcible language, and I hope it will have its due
</p>
<p>weight in those quarters for which it is intended, that no man
</p>
<p>ought, on any account whatever, to cross the Atlantic to settle iu
</p>
<p>the United States, unless he be seriously disposed to industry and
</p>
<p>economy, and determined not to be discouraged by those diffi-
</p>
<p>culties, which, even under favourable auspices, rarely fail to attend
</p>
<p>a change of country nor is it advisable for any man in Europe,
</p>
<p>who is happily or comfortably situated, to emigrate to this or any
</p>

</p>
<p>Philadelphia, May 25, 1826.
</p>
<p>REFLECTIONS, &e.
</p>
<p>When a man is deliberating about emigrating from his native
</p>
<p>country, and abandoning his friends and relatives, with all those
</p>
<p>objects endeared to him by associations from his infancy, it be-
</p>
<p>hoves him well to consider the character, habits, and manners of
</p>
<p>the people among whom he intends to domiciliate himself the si-
</p>
<p>tuation of the country the 'state of society the prospects of
</p>
<p>success in the peculiar occupation which he proposes to follow ;
</p>
<p>to weigh well the various disadvantages to which emigrants are
</p>
<p>more or less liable in strange countries, against those under which
</p>
<p>he labours at home as well as the advantages he hopes to enjoy,
</p>
<p>against those his native country affords ; and then, according to
</p>
<p>the preponderance on either side, to form his decision. This is
</p>
<p>the course which prudence dictates, and, when pursued with the
</p>
<p>care, attention, and scrutiny which the importance of the subject
</p>
<p>demands, can scarcely fail to lead to satisfactory results.
</p>
<p>To enable persons in Europe, inclined to emigrate, to decide this
</p>
<p>serious question, so far as regards this country, I shall present, as
</p>
<p>briefly as possible, such views of those points most necessary to
</p>
<p>be considered, in the character of the people, and in the situation
</p>
<p>of the United States, as cannot fail to aid in forming a 'correct
</p>
<p>judgment. These views are the result of a residence here, of
</p>
<p>above forty years : and, having arrived at mature age before I
</p>
<p>emigrated from Ireland, I hope I may assume t9 be in some degree
</p>
<p>qualified to make a comparison between the two portions of the
</p>
<p>globe.
</p>
<p>MANNERS OF THE PEOPLE.
</p>
<p>Cobbett, in four words, drew as accurate a portrait of the na-
</p>
<p>tional character of the people of the United States, as probably
</p>
<p>ever was drawn of any nation, on one point, of vital importance
</p>
<p>to emigrants. He said, they are " civil, but not servile." This,
</p>
<p>I repeat, is strictly accurate, and is highly honourable. A man
</p>
<p>may travel from the most northern boundary of the country to the
</p>
<p>Gulf of Florida and from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains ;

</p>
<p>and, provided he conduct himself decorously, he will be uniformly
</p>
<p>treated with civility. There are few countries in the world, of
</p>
<p>which the same declaration can be so unqualifiedly made. But
</p>
<p>let the traveller or settler, how high or exalted soever he be, by
</p>
<p>descent, standing, official station, personal or intellectual endow-
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>raents, or fortune, as he values his peace and comfort, beware of
</p>
<p>indulging in impertinence, petulance, or insolence. Whenever he
</p>
<p>places himself in that repulsive attitude, he may rest assured of
</p>
<p>being humbled and mortified, not merely by those who are his
</p>
<p>equals in point of fortune or talents, but even by the lowest mem-
</p>
<p>bers of society, who, accustomed to civility from the most exalted
</p>
<p>of their own countrymen, will not, for a moment, submit to inso-
</p>
<p>lence or impertinence from strangers. Those Europeans, therefore,
</p>
<p>who have been accustomed to domineer over, and even occasionally
</p>
<p>to strike, servants and other persons in humble stations, must
</p>
<p>wholly change their manners here, or else they will pay a heavy
</p>
<p>forfeit. I am persuaded there is scarcely a single servant, black
</p>
<p>or white, of the lowest order, in Philadelphia, who would submit,
</p>
<p>without return, to a stroke from a Croesus, or from a Lord or a
</p>
<p>Duke, " hung round with stars and garters," nor even to be out-
</p>
<p>raged with those gross and scurrilous epithets, which wealth and
</p>
<p>pride in certain parts of Europe so freely lavish on persons in
</p>
<p>subordinate situations.
</p>
<p>To the mass of persons disposed to emigrate from Europe, who
</p>
<p>are generally in the middle .and humble walks of life, principally
</p>
<p>in the latter, this is a most important consideration. They will
</p>
<p>not be obliged to crouch to fellow mortals, nor to submit to inso-
</p>
<p>lence or stripes from them, because those lordlings have more
</p>
<p>worldly wealth or higher rank than they. The poorest members
</p>
<p>of society may stand erect and unawed in the presence of their
</p>
<p>fellow man, whatever may be his grade, his station, or his wealth.
</p>
<p>This estimable feature in the American character is derived
</p>
<p>chiefly from the freedom of the governments, which, from the
</p>
<p>earliest period to the present time, have never recognised any of
</p>
<p>those arbitrary distinctions that prevail in Europe, dividing the
</p>
<p>people into castes, elevating the smaller number into something
</p>
<p>like " superior beings," and in the same degree degrading the
</p>
<p>majority. The benignant operation of this state of things mny be

</p>
<p>readily conceived. But another cause has, from the first settle-
</p>
<p>ment of America, co-operated to produce this effect. The facility
</p>
<p>of acquiring landed property in this country, has been uniformly
</p>
<p>so great, and the inducement to take an independent grade in so-
</p>
<p>ciety, is so powerful an incentive to the purchase of that species
</p>
<p>of property, that labourers and hired people of all descriptions,
</p>
<p>( who have universally had such liberal wages, that, by economy,
</p>
<p>they might, in a few years, save enough to buy farms,) have been,
</p>
<p>at all times, with hardly an exception, scarce and in demand.
</p>
<p>Employers, therefore, have held their hired people by a very pre-
</p>
<p>carious tenure. The latter knew their own value, and would not
</p>
<p>submit to harsh treatment. The former, aware of the conse-
</p>
<p>quence of oppression or ill usage, found the necessity of cour-
</p>
<p>teous behaviour. The steady operation of both the causes above
</p>
<p>recited, has produced that delightful state of society, as regards
</p>
<p>' the wealthy and those in humble life, in which the one would not
</p>
<p>. dare to oppress, and the other would not submit to oppression.
</p>
<p>The endearing relation between parents and children partakes
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>largely of the same mild character. The austerity, the harshness,
</p>
<p>and the severity which characterize this relation in some parts of
</p>
<p>kurope, are here unknown, except among some foreigners, who
</p>
<p>have brought liither the manners of their own countries. Children
</p>
<p>are scarcely ever banished into nurseries, or entrusted wholly to
</p>
<p>the care of hired servants, as is too frequently the case there.
</p>
<p>From an early period they are made companions by their parents,
</p>
<p>which affords an opportunity of expanding their ideas long before
</p>
<p>they would reach maturity, in the seclusion to which children in
</p>
<p>Europe are often subjected. They are likewise much earlier in-
</p>
<p>troduced into company than in that quarter. This inspires a con-
</p>
<p>fidence in themselves, extremely advantageous in their progress
</p>
<p>through life. In many cases, however, indulgence is here carried
</p>
<p>to a censurable extreme, and parental authority not sufficiently
</p>
<p>exercised. But, in general, the happy medium is preserved be-
</p>
<p>tween over indulgence and degrading severity. 1 have known
</p>
<p>some foreigners who used a whip or other instrument of correc-
</p>
<p>tion to their children at 18, 19, 20, and even beyond the period
</p>
<p>when minority had expired. No such case is to be found among
</p>
<p>natives of this country. A man who struck his child at that age,
</p>
<p>would be regarded with disgust.
</p>
<p>The pernicious and unnatural system of primogeniture, whereby
</p>
<p>the rights, the happiness, and the fortunes of the junior branches
</p>
<p>of a family are sacrificed for the aggrandizement of the oldest
</p>
<p>son, is abhorred in this country, and unknown to its laws and con-
</p>
<p>stitutions.
</p>
<p>The marriage connexion, on the proper regulation of which so
</p>
<p>large a portion of public virtue and happiness depends, takes place
</p>
<p>here rationally, and very differently from the custom in some parts
</p>
<p>of Europe. Control or coercion is altogether unknown. The
</p>
<p>parties are, in almost every case, as, with some slight limitation,
</p>
<p>they ought to be in all,: perfectly free agents. Matches are
</p>
<p>scarcely ever definitely made by parents. Stipulations for fortune

</p>
<p>on the part of the male are extremely rare ; and, therefore,
</p>
<p>daughters are incomparably easier settled here than in other
</p>
<p>countries, in many of which the sex, without fortune or great
</p>
<p>personal beauty, undergoes a withering neglect. This considera^
</p>
<p>tion, to parents influenced by proper regard for the welfare and
</p>
<p>happiness of their children, is all-important. A parent who has a
</p>
<p>fortune to bestow with his daughter, frequently settles it on her
</p>
<p>and her issue, thus guarding her and them against the contin-
</p>
<p>gencies to which human affairs are so liable.
</p>
<p>When men enter into society, besides various minor advantages
</p>
<p>proposed, there are three great objects in view security of person
</p>
<p>security of property and the glorious privilege of worshipping
</p>
<p>God according to the dictates of their consciences. Now it is
</p>
<p>easy to prove that there is no country superior to the United
</p>
<p>States in these respects.
</p>
<p>SECURITY OF PERSON'.
</p>
<p>With respect to this species of security, a very brief view will be
</p>
<p>sufficient for our purpose. ^
</p>
<p>IS
</p>
<p>Trial by jury is secured to every person accused of crime.
</p>
<p>Unreasonable bail is expressly forbidden by our constitutions.
</p>
<p>The habeas corpus, that sacred bulwark of liberty, is in full force;
</p>
<p>and, amidst all the difficulties and dangers that the country has had
</p>
<p>to struggle with, in a period of infancy and comparative feeble-
</p>
<p>ness, was never suspended. It is true that, in the extraordinary
</p>
<p>emergency and danger of New Orleans, when it was believed that
</p>
<p>some timid or disaffected citizens contemplated a surrender of the
</p>
<p>place to the British, General .Jackson proclaimed martial law, to
</p>
<p>save that all-important city, which, but for that bold measure,
</p>
<p>would very probably have been captured.
</p>
<p>TAXATION AND SUPPORT OF GOVERNMENT.
</p>
<p>The taxes in the United States are comparatively insignificant.
</p>
<p>There is no excise, nor direct tax imposed by the general govern-
</p>
<p>ment, the support of which is derived wholly from impost on im-
</p>
<p>ported goods, tonnage duties, ad the sale of public lands. The
</p>
<p>support of the government of Pennsylvania is derived from auction
</p>
<p>duties, arrears of the payment of public lands, tavern licenses,
</p>
<p>and licenses for the sale of foreign merchandise.* The county
</p>
<p>taxes are generally very moderate, and the funds obtained from
</p>
<p>them are employed for the payment of the expenses attendant on
</p>
<p>the administration -of justice, the preservation and improvement of
</p>
<p>public roads, and the education of the poor. The expenditure
</p>
<p>and application of the money raised by those taxes are committed
</p>
<p>to persons annually elected by those who pay them.
</p>
<p>The poor tax, so excessively burdensome in England, is insig-
</p>
<p>nificant in the United States, and probably does not exceed,
</p>
<p>throughout the state of Pennsylvania, cities and towns excepted,
</p>
<p>one shilling sterling per head. In the cities it is higher. In Phi-
</p>
<p>ladelphia, with a population of 130,000 souls, the poor tax of 1823
</p>
<p>was only 114,468 dollars, and this is greatly beyond the proper
</p>
<p>proportion of the city, as the chief part of the paupers of the
</p>
<p>state centre in the metropolis. The whole of the taxes of this

</p>

</p>
<p>on at an expense of 75 cents, or about 3s. 4^d. sterling per head,
</p>
<p>being little more than one-third of the araonnt of the poor rates
</p>
<p>in England.
</p>
<p>RELIGION.
</p>
<p>There is, I believe, no part of Europe in which religious liberty is
</p>
<p>to be found as it prevails here. In this point the United States stand
</p>
<p>proudly pre-eminent over most of the nations of the eastern hemi-
</p>
<p>sphere, from the period when Christianity was there taken under
</p>
<p>the protection of Government to the present time. Almost every-
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>Our citizens are free as air to worship God in whatever form or
</p>
<p>riiode they please. Religion interposes no bar or disqualification
</p>
<p>as regards civil rights. The Jew, the Roman Catholic, the most
</p>
<p>rigid Calvinist, the Protestant Episcopalian, the Paedo Baptist, the
</p>
<p>Anti-peedo Baptist, the Socinian, the Swedenborgian, all, all stand
</p>
<p>on the same ground, in the public eye;* and the charities and en-
</p>
<p>joyments of social life are never interrupted by differences of re-
</p>
<p>ligion, how great soever they may be.
</p>
<p>That this state of religious liberty has a benign effect, cannot be
</p>
<p>doubted, as there is no country in Europe which contains more
</p>
<p>truly religious persons than the United States, in proportion to
</p>
<p>the population.
</p>
<p>So far as regards religion, there is no such word in the American
</p>
<p>language as " toleration." This disgraceful word, in the English,
</p>
<p>French, and other buropean languages, means, that a miserable
</p>
<p>worm, who worships God in one particular form, permits hi
</p>
<p>fellow worm to do the same and does not subject him to tines
</p>
<p>and forfeitures impale him on a stake suspend him on a gibbet
</p>
<p>or light faggots to burn him to death, as the forefathers of almost
</p>
<p>all Christian denominations, Catholics, Protestants, and Presby-
</p>
<p>terians, did in days past !
</p>
<p>Connected with this subject, is the support of the clergy : and
</p>
<p>here how transcendant American superiority ! Our happy citizens
</p>
<p>are not obliged to devote to a pampered establishment a tenth part
</p>
<p>of the produce of the soil, besides supporting the clergy of their
</p>
<p>own particular denomination. The man, therefore, who raises five
</p>
<p>thousand bushels of wheat, is not compelled, as in Great Britain
</p>
<p>ami Ireland, to give five hundred to a clergyman over whose ap-
</p>
<p>pointment he has had no control, and whose religion he perhaps
</p>
<p>abhors.
</p>
<p>In nearly all the states the support of the cli rgy is wholly vo-
</p>
<p>luntary. In cities and towns, and sometimes in villages, the rents
</p>
<p>of pews generally afford a sufficient income for the purpose. In

</p>
<p>Massachusets, New Hampshire, and Connecticut, the citizens are
</p>
<p>subjected to a small annual tax for the maintenance of Christian
</p>
<p>worship but they have the right to select the clergymen to
</p>
<p>whom it shall bo paid. There is not the shadow, from Maine to
</p>
<p>Florida, of a religious establishment connected with the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>POLITICAL PRIVILEGES.
</p>
<p>This is an important feature in the character of the country.
</p>
<p>In the states of Pennsylvania and New York, every citizen paying
</p>
<p>tax of any kind, is entitled to the right of suffrage as fully and as
</p>
<p>completely as the owner of a million of acres or the possessor of
</p>
<p>the wealth of Croesus and all offices of honour and emolument,
</p>
<p>" except the presidency of the United States, (which is the only
</p>
<p>In one or two of the states the exclusion of Roman Catholics from public offices,
</p>
<p>enacted in times of intolerance and hipotry, remains in the constitutions. But there U
</p>
<p>no doubt, that whenever those constitutions are Milmiitted to conventions for rerision.
</p>
<p>this foul stain will be obliterated.
</p>
<p>IS
</p>
<p>one that requires that the occupant be a native citizen, or have-
</p>
<p>been a citizen at the time of the adoption of the existing form of
</p>
<p>government, 1787,) are as fully open to a naturalized as to a na-
</p>
<p>tive citizen. Many highly important offices in different states, and
</p>
<p>under the general government, are filled by the former. The fol-
</p>
<p>lowing are the terms on which citizenship may be acquired by
</p>
<p>foreigners : five years uninterrupted residence in the United States,
</p>
<p>and one year in the state where it is applied for a declaration
</p>
<p>on oath or affirmation, three years before the application, of a bona
</p>
<p>Jide intention to become a citizen, and of a determination to sup-
</p>
<p>port the constitution of the United States, with a renunciation of
</p>
<p>allegiance to all foreign powers.
</p>
<p>The number of votes presented in the city of Philadelphia for
</p>
<p>members of the legislature is about 8,000. The whole number
</p>
<p>of votes given for governor of the state at the last election in
</p>
<p>1823, was 154>, 147, or more than one-ninth of the whole popu-
</p>
<p>lation.
</p>
<p>CRIMINAL CODE.
</p>
<p>Human life has its proper value in the United States not so in
</p>
<p>Europe. In Pennsylvania there is but one capital crime murder
</p>
<p>in the first degree. The severity of the criminal code has been
</p>
<p>gradually mitigating from year to year in most of the states. In
</p>
<p>some the mitigation has been slow ; in others, rapid and important.
</p>
<p>But the progress of public opinion affords a sure pledge that at no
</p>

</p>
<p>chase and keep as many as he may judge proper and can pay for.
</p>
<p>And so far as regards game, the possessor of millions has no pri-
</p>
<p>vilege beyond that which is enjoyed by one of our humblest citi-
</p>
<p>zens.
</p>
<p>Having pointed out a few of the prominent features in the moral
</p>
<p>and political character of the United States, I proceed to consider
</p>
<p>the descriptions of persons to whom it holds out advantages and
</p>
<p>inducements to emigrate from their native countries, and also
</p>
<p>those to whom emigration for the purpose of settlement here,
</p>
<p>would be disadvantageous.
</p>
<p>AGRICULTURISTS.
</p>
<p>The greatest evil in the United States is the excess of the agri-
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>cultural population,* which is at least 30 per cent, more than is
</p>
<p>necessary to furnish the foreign and domestic markets, limited as
</p>
<p>the former are by the wise policy of the buropean nations, which
</p>
<p>protect their own agriculturists, and never admit our bread stuffs,
</p>
<p>but when in danger of famine, or of such a scarcity as will so far
</p>
<p>enhance the price of those necessaries of life, as to oppress and
</p>
<p>distress the poorer classes of society.
</p>
<p>The mischievous effects of this unwise distribution of our popu-
</p>
<p>lation were not felt during the wars of the French Revolution,
</p>
<p>nor for a year or two afterwards, while the European markets
</p>
<p>were open to our bread stuffs, which commanded extravagant
</p>
<p>prices. But since those markets were closed in the fall of 1817,f
</p>
<p>the operation of this undue proportion of agriculturists has been
</p>
<p>highly pernicious. The export of flour in 1817 : was 1,488,198
</p>
<p>barrels, amounting to 17,751,375 dollars. Whereas in 1822,
</p>
<p>1823, and 1824-, the export was only 2 581,359 barrels amounting
</p>
<p>to 15, 724,829 dollars ; or an average of 860,4-53 barrels, and
</p>
<p>5,241,609 dollars. The export, of 1825, was 813,906 barrels,
</p>
<p>amounting to only 4-, 212,127 dollars.
</p>
<p>From this view, it is evident that the policy of our Govern-
</p>
<p>ment has a withering influence on the agriculture of the United
</p>
<p>States. All the markets of the world, wherein the produce of
</p>
<p>our soil is received, are almost constantly glutted with our great
</p>
<p>staples,, bread stuffs, cotton, and tobacco, the prices of which are
</p>
<p>therefore greatly depressed, to the injury of our farmers, and
</p>
<p>The population of the United States in the year 1820, when the last census was taken,
</p>
<p>was arranged as follows : Heads ofFamiliet. Per Cent.

<p>The whole of the population at that period was 9,614,415, and was thus distributed :
</p>
<p>Engaged in agriculture 8,022,319 83

<p>The total number of familiei in Great Britain in 1821, was 2,931,083
</p>
<p>Of which were engaged in agriculture 978,656

<p>in trade and commerce 15,507
</p>
<p>all other descriptions 612,488
</p>
<p>S.931.083
</p>
<p>Thus, while in Great Britain one-third part of the population suffices for agriculture, and
</p>
<p>feeds the whole, there are, in this country, 83 per cent, engaged in that pursuit, the whole
</p>
<p>amount of whose exports in the year 1824, was only 43,884,844 dollars, produced by about
</p>
<p>10,000,000 people; and, excluding tobacco, cotton, and rice, (produced by about 1,500,000
</p>
<p>persons,) the whole of the exports of the remaining 8,500,000 agriculturists, was only
</p>
<p>15,198,895 dollars! Whereas the export from Great Britain in 1S25, of the mere article
</p>
<p>of cotton yarn, produced probably by 150,000 persons, was 3,135, 406, equal to 14,199,732
</p>
<p>dollars ! What stupendous facts !
</p>
<p>t The British ports were opened for the reception of our flour In November, 1818, and

</p>
<p>the too frequent ruin of our merchants.* Against this destructive
</p>
<p>policy, Alexander Hamilton,-}- one of the greatest practical politi-
</p>
<p>cal economists that ever lived, Dr. Franklin, j and Thomas Jeffer-
</p>
<p>son, $ two of our greatest statesmen, have borne the most decided
</p>
<p>testimony, but in vain. Every attempt to introduce a sounder
</p>
<p>policy is resisted with as much zeal and ardour as if the change
</p>
<p>were fraught with destruction and, strange to tell, by those who
</p>
<p>are the greatest sufferers by the present system !
</p>
<p>It may seem extraordinary that I believe, nevertheless, that
</p>
<p>certain descriptions of farmers might advantageously immigrate
</p>
<p>* The consequence of this pernicious state of things, is, that in three cases out of four,
</p>
<p>the greater the quantity of our leading staples we export, the less in proportion they
</p>
<p>produce. This general result of glutted markets, occasionally, it is true, controlled and
</p>
<p>counteracted by circumstances, was two hundred years since discerned, and as far as
</p>
<p>practicable, guarded against by the sagacious policy of the Dutch, in the case of spices.
</p>
<p>They limited the cultivation within bounds calculated to guard against a ruinous dimi-
</p>
<p>nution of price ; and, when the crops were too abundant, went the extraordinary length
</p>
<p>of destroying the surplus quantity. Whereas the unvarying tendency of our policy has
</p>
<p>been, by converting the domestic customers of our farmers into rivals, to increase pro-
</p>
<p>duction, even while our foreign markets, as in the case of grain, were diminishing. A
</p>
<p>view of the quantity and amount of cotton aud flour exported in different years, will shed
</p>
<p>strong light on this doctrine.

<p>The early ssttlers in Maryland and Virginia, finding the foreign markets ruinously glut-

<p>been so long and so feelingly deplored." " To enhance, if possible, the price of a commo-

</p>
<p>tobacco for a limited time." " The same inconvenience being at length probably felt in

<p>Maryland, a law was passed in 1666, to enforce a similar project." Chalmers's Annals, p. 314.

</p>
<p>into the United States. It is, however, the fact, as I shall en-
</p>
<p>deavour to make appear.
</p>
<p>A few skilful farmers, without any capital, but possessed of good
</p>
<p>characters, and bringing with them such recommendations as
</p>
<p>would insure confidence, might derive great advantage from immi-
</p>
<p>gration into the United States. Such men in Great Britain
</p>
<p>and Ireland can scarcely hope to emerge beyond the situation of
</p>
<p>day labourers, at the rate of 8s. 6d.9s. or 10s.* per week, and have
</p>
<p>no prospect for sickness, or old age, but the poor-house :f whereas
</p>
<p>in the neighbourhood of our cities, persons of this description
</p>
<p>can readily procure contracts for the cultivation of farms from 4-0
</p>
<p>to 80 or 100 acres on the shares, on the following plan. The
</p>
<p>owner of the land furnishes half the seed, the implements, and
</p>
<p>oxen; the farmer half the seed and labour. The proceeds are
</p>
<p>equally divided between them; and though the farmer's share is
</p>
<p>moderate, still the situation of tile emigrant would be greatly
</p>
<p>improved, and by steady industry and economy he might make
</p>
<p>handsome savings, and finally become an independent landholder.
</p>
<p>Another class of farmers would find immigration into the United
</p>
<p>States highly advantageous. I mean those possessed of small capi-
</p>
<p>tals, say from 300 to 750 pounds sterling. What with rent, ex-
</p>
<p>cise, tithes, and taxes, (poor rates are added in England,) such
</p>
<p>men can barely subsist in Great Britain and Ireland. .Let me
</p>
<p>state iheir prospects in the United States.
</p>
<p>Good farms with valuable improvements, a dwelling-house,
</p>
<p>barn, and spring house on each, may be purchased at 20 or 30
</p>
<p>miles from Philadelphia, for 30 or 40 dollars per acre. J
</p>
<p>At a greater distance from Philadelphia, say 4>0 or 50 miles*
</p>
<p>lands, with extensive improvements, may be purchased for 20 dol-
</p>
<p>lars per acre. In the interior of Pennsylvania and New York*
</p>
<p>* It appears by a recent publication, " A History and Review of the late Session of the
</p>
<p>British Parliament," that the wages of country labourers in Dorsetshire are only 7s. per
</p>
<p>week, equal to one dollar and fifty-six cants.

<p>t From a late Morning Herald the following statement is taken of the wages and ex-
</p>
<p>penditure of an English labouring agriculturist:
</p>
<p>Earnings of a labourer in agriculture, at 9s per week, per annum 23 8
</p>
<p>Clothes for self and family-
</p>
<p>Fuel
</p>
<p>Candles, soap, salt, &c
</p>

</p>
<p>28 12
</p>
<p>Th balance is made up by the contributions of the overseers of, the poor.
</p>
<p>t From the books of a Philadelphia agent for the sale of real estate, the following ex-
</p>
<p>tracts are taken -.-^1 44 acres, in Bucks' County, 32 miles from Philadelphia, with a large
</p>
<p>dwelling-house, stables, waggon house, &c. at 32 dollars per acre 100 acres, 33 miles
</p>
<p>from Philadelphia, with a stone d* elling-house, stone kitchen, barn, &c. for 4000 dollars. '.
</p>
<p>108 acres, 30 miles from Philadelphia, with a stone dwelling-house, barn. &c. &c.
</p>
<p>4000 dollars.
</p>
<p>These, it Is to be observed, are the prices Hslted from which probably a considefable
</p>
<p>abatement would be made.
</p>
<p>ao
</p>
<p>uncleared lands, contiguous to navigable streams, may be pur-
</p>
<p>chased for two, three, and four dollars. The expense of clearing
</p>
<p>is about ten or eleven dollars per acre and I am assured, on re-
</p>
<p>spectable authority, that the first crop ot wheat after clearing,
</p>
<p>will generally pay that expense. These lands hold out powerful
</p>
<p>encouragement to industrious and enterprising emigrants. The
</p>
<p>great progress of the woollen manufacture renders the raising of
</p>
<p>sheep a lucrative business for farmers. The internal improve-
</p>
<p>ments in canals and roads, effected and contemplated in both
</p>
<p>those states, will secure extraordinary advantages to sellers con-
</p>
<p>tiguous to these means of communication. To farmers with large
</p>
<p>and industrious families, these sections of the country hold out
</p>
<p>every temptation as they may carry on cultivation extensively
</p>
<p>with little hired labour.*
</p>
<p>New lands, belonging to the United States, may be had in the
</p>
<p>western states anil territories ibr 125 cents, or 5s. 7d. sterling
</p>
<p>per acre, in perpetuity. Thus, for a fourth part of the mere tithe
</p>
<p>per acre, paid in many parts of Great Britain and Ireland, lands
</p>
<p>may be purchased in fee-simple. This appears to offer strong
</p>
<p>temptation ; as complete independence may be secured at so very
</p>
<p>easy a rate. But I am much inclined to believe that few English,
</p>
<p>Irish, Scotch, or German farmers are well calculated to struggle
</p>
<p>with the difficulties in those remote quarters, where the popula-
</p>
<p>tion is so thinly scattered, and where the settlers are in some de-
</p>
<p>gree debarred from markets for their produce.
</p>
<p>The following are the prices of stock in and near Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>Good working horses from 50 to 90 dollars. Cows from 15 to2
</p>
<p>dollars. Fresh cows, with their calves, from 25 to 30 dollars.
</p>
<p>Oxen in a lean state, sell for three and a half to four dollars per
</p>
<p>cwt. fattened, four and a half to five dollars.
</p>
<p>In order to enable farmers to form an idea of what they have
</p>
<p>a right to expect by settling in this country, I will state the prices,
</p>
<p>in the Philadelphia markets, of various articles, some of which

<p>very great encouragement. There is hardly a state in the Union
</p>
<p>in which canals and rail-roads are not either commenced or
</p>
<p>contemplated.
</p>
<p>..'
</p>
<p>MINERS AND MINERALOGISTS.
</p>
<p>For scientific persons of these descriptions, there is great scope
</p>
<p>in the United States. There is probably no country richer in
</p>
<p>every species of mines and minerals ; and a very small propor-
</p>
<p>tion of these boundless treasures has been explored.
</p>
<p>LABOURERS.
</p>
<p>There is scarcely any limit to the number of labourers, who
</p>
<p>are now, and probably will be for twenty years to come, wanted in
</p>
<p>this country. The spirit of internal improvement, in canals,
</p>
<p>rail-roads, and turnpikes, is wide awake in every part of the
</p>
<p>Union ; and creates a great demand for that class, of which the
</p>
<p>number of native citizens bears no proportion to the demand.
</p>
<p>The Irish labourers are found uncommonly hardy and active, and
</p>
<p>for years have done a large portion of the work on canals and
</p>
<p>turnpikes. Their wages are about seventy-five cents per day, or
</p>
<p>four dollars and a half per week. Their board, which includes
</p>
<p>meat every day, and often twice a day, costs about two dollars,
</p>
<p>leaving a balance of about two dollars and a half, or 11s. 3d.
</p>
<p>sterling, which is far more than the whole of their earnings in
</p>
<p>their own country.
</p>
<p>A statement of the price of provisions will show the comfort
</p>
<p>which this class of our citizens may enjoy. In the Philadelphia
</p>
<p>market at this time, beef costs ten cents per pound mutton five
</p>
<p>cents veal six to eight cents a pair of large fowls thirty-seven
</p>
<p>to fifty rents a turkey from fifty to seventy-five cents bread,
</p>
<p>per Ib. 3 cents.
</p>
<p>The wages of country labourers are high from 7/5 to TOO dol-
</p>
<p>lars per annum, exclusive of comfortable board and lodging.
</p>
<p>CLERKS AND SHOPKEEPERS. 3d
</p>
<p>To these classes the United States hold out no temp*9n.

<p>subj' and the most deliberate reflection, I feel satisfied, there-
</p>
<p>fore, c it while the present policy of our government continues,
</p>
<p>there . little temptation for manufacturers generally to remove to
</p>
<p>this co jntry.* They are created fast enough here.
</p>
<p>Hovever, there is a considerable opening for mechanics of
</p>
<p>almost; jvery description, carpenters, masons, smiths, plasterers,
</p>
<p>&c. '.id should the government ever adequately consult the
</p>
<p>inten ^ of agriculture, .and take decisive measures to make a
</p>
<p>domestL- market for the raw materials and provisions of our far-
</p>
<p>mers, by proper encouragement to manufactures, there will be
</p>
<p>abunuant room in the United States for all the manufacturers and
</p>
<p>farmers that Europe can spare. The policy of this course is so
</p>
<p>plain id clear, that it can scarcely be doubted that it will be
</p>
<p>adop.-i at no distant day.
</p>
<p>Jou. ueymen's wages in Philadelphia vary from one dollar to a
</p>
<p>dollar 'ad a half per day. Probably one dollar and an eighth,
</p>
<p>or 5'. sterling, is about the average.
</p>
<p>It r".y be laid down as a general rule, with few exceptions,
</p>
<p>that : -a ;al, industrious journeymen, unencumbered with families,
</p>
<p>may save so much of their wages, as, in a few years, to be ena-
</p>
<p>ble ti commence business on their own account on a moderate
</p>
<p>scale. The exceptions to this rule are exclusively confined to
</p>
<p>trades or occupations that require large establishments ; and even
</p>
<p>in thesj the object is generally attainable ultimately only requir-
</p>
<p>ing i~ Conger period of industry and economy. I believe 1 am

<p>perftvtiy warranted in saying that one-half, or certainly one-third

<p>Uni jd States, many of whom are now worth 20, 30, 40, or

<p>50,0 collars, were originally journeymen. This is among the

<p>most ?' picious features in the character of American society.
