<p>ARGUMENT
</p>
<p>JOHN A. BINGHAM,
</p>
<p>SPECIAL JUDGE ADVOCATE
</p>
<p>IN reply to
</p>
<p>THE SEVERAL ARGUMENTS IN DEFENCE OP MARY E. SURRATT AND
</p>
<p>OTHERS, CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACY AND THE MURDER
</p>
<p>OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN, LATE PRESIDENT OF
</p>
<p>THE UNITED STATES, &c
</p>
<p>May it please the Court : The conspiracy here charged and speci
</p>
<p>fied, and the acts alleged to have been committed in pursuance thereof,
</p>
<p>and with the intent laid, constitute a crime the atrocity of which has
</p>
<p>[sent a shudder through the civilized world. All that was agreed
</p>
<p>Iupon and attempted by the alleged inciters and instigators of this
</p>
<p>jorime constitutes a combination of atrocities with scarcely a parallel
</p>
<p>in the annals of the human race. Whether the prisoners at your bar
</p>
<p>iare guilty of the conspiracy and the acts alleged to have been done
</p>
<p>in pursuance thereof, as set forth in the charge and specification, is a
</p>
<p>question the determination of which rests solely with this honorable
</p>
<p>court, and in passing upon which this court are the sole judges of the
</p>
<p>law and the fact.
</p>
<p>In presenting my views upon the questions of law raised' by the
</p>
<p>several counsel for the defence, and also on the testimony adduced
</p>
<p>for and against the accused, I desire to be just to them, just to you,
</p>
<p>just to my country, and just to my own convictions. The issue joined
</p>
<p>involves the highest interests of the accused, and", in my judgment,
</p>
<p>the highest interests of the whole people of the United States.
</p>
<p>It is a matter of great moment to all the people of this country
</p>
<p>that the prisoners at your bar be lawfully tried and lawfully convicted
</p>
<p>or acquitted. A wrongful and illegal conviction or a wrongful and
</p>
<p>illegal acquittal upon this dread issue would impair somewhat the

</p>
<p>security of every man's life, and shake the stability of the republic.
</p>
<p>The crime charged and specified upon your record is not simply
</p>
<p>the crime of murdering a human being, but it is the crime of killing
</p>
<p>and murdering on the 14th day of April, A. D. 1865, within the mili
</p>
<p>tary department of Washington and the intrenched lines thereof, Abra
</p>
<p>ham Lincoln, then President of the United States, and commander-
</p>
<p>in-chief of the army and navy thereof ; and then and there assault
</p>
<p>ing, with intent to kill and murder, William H. Seward, then Secre
</p>
<p>tary of State of the United States ; and then and there lying in wait
</p>
<p>to kill and murder Andrew Johnson, then Vice President of the United
</p>
<p>States, and Ulysses S. Grant, then lieutenant general and in command
</p>
<p>of the armies of the United States, in pursuance of a treasonable
</p>
<p>conspiracy entered into by the accused with one John Wilkes Booth,
</p>
<p>and John H. Surratt, upon the instigation of Jefferson Davis, Jacob
</p>
<p>Thompson, and George N. Sanders and others, with intent thereby
</p>
<p>to aid the existing rebellion and subvert the Constitution and laws of
</p>
<p>the United States.
</p>
<p>The rebellion, in aid of which this conspiracy was formed and this
</p>
<p>great public crime committed, was prosecuted for the vindication of
</p>
<p>no right, for the redress of no wrong, but was itself simply a criminal
</p>
<p>conspiracy and gigantic assassination. In resisting and crushing this
</p>
<p>rebellion the American people take no step backward, and cast no
</p>
<p>reproach upon their past history. That people now, as ever, proclaim
</p>
<p>the self-evident truth that whenever government becomes subversive
</p>
<p>of the ends of its creation, it is the right and duty of the people to
</p>
<p>alter or abolish it; but during these four years of conflict they have
</p>
<p>as clearly proclaimed, as was their right and duty, both by law and
</p>
<p>by arms, that the government of their own choice, humanely and
</p>
<p>wisely administered, oppressive of none and just to all, shall not be
</p>
<p>overthrown by privy conspiracy or armed rebellion.
</p>
<p>What wrong had this government or any of its duly constituted
</p>
<p>agents done to any of the guilty actors in this atrocious rebellion?
</p>
<p>They themselves being witnesses, the government which they as
</p>
<p>sailed had done no act, and attempted nb act, injurious to them or
</p>
<p>in any sense violative of their rights as citizens and men; and yet for
</p>
<p>four years, without cause of complaint or colorable excuse, the incit
</p>
<p>ers and instigators of the conspiracy charged upon your record have

</p>
<p>by armed rebellion, resisted the lawful authority of the government
</p>
<p>and attempted by force of arms to blot the republic from the map of
</p>
<p>nations. Now that their battalions of treason are broken and flying
</p>
<p>before the victorious legions of the republic, the chief traitors in this
</p>
<p>great crime against your government secretly conspire with their
</p>
<p>hired confederates to achieve by assassination, if possible, what they
</p>
<p>have in vain attempted by wager of battle  the overthrow of the
</p>
<p>government of the United States and the subversion of its Constitu
</p>
<p>tion and laws. It is for this secret conspiracy in the interest of the
</p>
<p>rebellion, formed at the instigation of the chiefs in that rebellion,
</p>
<p>and in pursuance of which the, acts charged and specified are alleged
</p>
<p>to have been done and with the intent laid, that the accused are
</p>
<p>upon trial.
</p>
<p>The government in preferring this charge does not indict the whole
</p>
<p>people of any State or section, but only the alleged parties to this un
</p>
<p>natural and atrocious conspiracy and crime. The President of the
</p>
<p>United States, in the discharge of his duty as commander-in-chief of
</p>
<p>the army, and by virtue of the power vested in him by the Constitu
</p>
<p>tion and laws of the United States, has constituted you a military
</p>
<p>court, to hear and determine the issue joined against the accused,
</p>
<p>and has constituted you a court for no other purpose whatever. To
</p>
<p>this charge and specification the defendants have pleaded, first, that
</p>
<p>this court has no jurisdiction in the premises; and, second, not guilty.
</p>
<p>As the court has already overruled the plea to the jurisdiction, it
</p>
<p>would be passed over in silence by me but for the fact, that a grave
</p>
<p>and elaborate argument has been made by counsel, for the accused,
</p>
<p>not only to show the want of jurisdiction, but to arraign the President
</p>
<p>of the United States before the country and the world as a usurper of
</p>
<p>power over the lives and the liberties of the prisoners. Denying the
</p>
<p>authority of the President to constitute this commission is an aver
</p>
<p>ment that this tribunal is not a court of justice, has no legal existence,
</p>
<p>and therefore no power to hear and determine the issue joined. The
</p>
<p>learned counsel for the accused, when they make this averment by
</p>
<p>way of argument, owe it to themselves and to their country to show
</p>
<p>how the President could otherwise lawfully and efficiently discharge
</p>
<p>the duty enjoined upon him by his oath to protect, preserve, and de
</p>
<p>fend the Constitution of the United States, and to, take care that the
</p>
<p>laws be faithfully executed.
</p>
<p>An existing rebellion is alleged and not denied. It is charged that
</p>
<p>in aid of this existing rebellion a conspiracy was entered into by the
</p>
<p>accused, incited and instigated thereto by the chiefs of this rebellion,

</p>
<p>to kill and murder the executive officers of the government, and the
</p>
<p>commander of the armies of the United States, and that this conspi
</p>
<p>racy was partly executed by the murder of Abrahain Lincoln, and by
</p>
<p>a murderous assault upon the Secretary of State; and counsel reply,
</p>
<p>by elaborate argument, that although the facts be as charged, though
</p>
<p>6
</p>
<p>the conspirator's be numerous and at large, able and eager to com
</p>
<p>plete the horrid work of assassination already begun within your
</p>
<p>military encampment, yet the successor of your murdered President
</p>
<p>is a usurper if he attempts by military force and martial law, as com
</p>
<p>mander-in-chief, to prevent the consummation of this traitorous con
</p>
<p>spiracy in aid of this treasonable rebellion. The civil courts, say
</p>
<p>the counsel, are open in the District. I answer, they are closed
</p>
<p>throughout half the republic, and were only open in this District
</p>
<p>on the day of this confederation and conspiracy, on the day of the
</p>
<p>traitorous assassination of your President, and are only open
</p>
<p>at this hour, by force of the bayonet. Does any man suppose that if
</p>
<p>the military forces which garrison the intrenchmonts of your cap
</p>
<p>ital, fifty thousand strong, were all withdrawn, the rebel bands
</p>
<p>who this day infest the mountain passes in your vicinity would allow
</p>
<p>this court, or any court, to remain open in this District for the trial
</p>
<p>of these their confederates, or would permit your executive officers to
</p>
<p>discharge the trust committed to them, for twenty-four hours?
</p>
<p>At the time this conspiracy was entered into, and when this court
</p>
<p>was convened and entered upon this trial, the country was in a state
</p>
<p>of civil war. An army of insurrectionists have, since this trial begun,
</p>
<p>shed the blood of Union soldiers in battle. The conspirator, by
</p>
<p>whose hand his co- conspirators, whether present or absent, jointly
</p>
<p>murdered the President on the 14th of last April, could not be
</p>
<p>and was not arrested upon civil process, but was pursued by the
</p>
<p>military power of the government, captured, and slain. Was this
</p>
<p>an act of usurpation ?  a violation of the right guaranteed to that
</p>
<p>fleeing assassin by the very Constitution against which and for the
</p>
<p>subversion of which he had conspired and murdered the President ?
</p>
<p>Who in all this land is bold enough or base enough to assert it '?
</p>
<p>I would be glad to know by what law the President, by a military
</p>
<p>force, acting only upon his military orders, is justified in pursuing,
</p>
<p>arresting, and killing one of these conspirators, and is condemned for
</p>
<p>arresting in like manner, and by his order subjecting to trial, accord
</p>
<p>ing to the laws of war, any or all of the other parties to this same
</p>
<p>damnable conspiracy and crime, by a military tribunal of justice a

</p>
<p>tribunal, I may be pardoned for saying, whose integrity and impar
</p>
<p>tiality are above suspicion, and pass unchallenged even by the
</p>
<p>accused themselves.
</p>
<p>The argument against the jurisdiction of this court rests upon the
</p>
<p>assumption that even in time of insurrection, and civil war, no crimes
</p>
<p>are cognizable and punishable by military commission or court-martial,
</p>
<p>save crimes committed in the military or naval service of the United
</p>
<p>States, or in the militia of the several States when called into the
</p>
<p>actual service of the United States. But that is not all the argument :
</p>
<p>it affirms that under this plea to the jurisdiction, the accused have
</p>
<p>the right to demand that this court shall decide that it is not a ju
</p>
<p>dicial tribunal and has no legal existence.
</p>
<p>This is"a most extraordinary proposition  that the President, under
</p>
<p>the Constitution and laws of the United States, was not only not au
</p>
<p>thorized' but absolutely forbidden to constitute this court for the
</p>
<p>trial of the accused, and, therefore, the act of the President is void,
</p>
<p>and the gentlemen who compose the tribunal without judicial authority
</p>
<p>or power, and are not in fact or in law a court.
</p>
<p>That I do not misstate what is claimed and attempted to be estab
</p>
<p>lished on behalf of the accused, I ask the attention of the court to
</p>
<p>the following as the gentleman' s (Mr. Johnson' s) propositions :
</p>
<p>That Congress has not authorized, and, under the Constitution,
</p>
<p>cannot authorize the appointment of this commission.
</p>
<p>That this commission has, " as a court, no legal existence or au
</p>
<p>thority," because the President, who alone appointed the commission,
</p>
<p>has no such power.
</p>
<p>That his act " is a mere nullity  the usurpation of a power not
</p>
<p>vested in the Executive, and conferring no authority upon you."
</p>
<p>We have had no common exhibition of law learning in this De
</p>
<p>fence, prepared by a Senator of the United States ; but with all his
</p>
<p>experience, and all his learning, and acknowledged ability, he has
</p>
<p>failed, utterly failed, to show how a tribunal constituted and sworn,
</p>
<p>as this has been, to duly try and determine the charge and specifica
</p>
<p>tion against the accused, and by its commission not authorized
</p>
<p>to hear or determine any other issues whatever, can rightfully en
</p>
<p>tertain, or can by any possibility pass upon, the proposition pre
</p>
<p>sented by this argument of the gentleman for its consideration.
</p>
<p>The members of this court are officers in the army of the
</p>
<p>United States, and by order of the President, as Commander-in-
</p>
<p>Chief, are required to discharge this duty, and are authorized in this
</p>
<p>capacity to discharge no other duty, to exercise no other judicial

</p>
<p>power. Of course, if the commission of the President constitutes
</p>
<p>this a court for the trial of this case only, as such court it is compe^
</p>
<p>tent to decide all questions of law and fact arising in the trial of the
</p>
<p>case. But this court has no power, as a court, to declare ,the au
</p>
<p>thority by which it was constituted null and void, and the act of the
</p>
<p>8
</p>
<p>President a mere nullity, a usurpation. Has it been shown by the
</p>
<p>learned gentleman, who demands that this court shall so decide, that
</p>
<p>officers of, the army may lawfully and constitutionally question in this
</p>
<p>manner the orders of their Commander-in-Chief, disobey, set them
</p>
<p>aside, and declare them a nullity and a usurpation ? Even if it be con
</p>
<p>ceded that the officers thus detailed by order of the Commander-in-
</p>
<p>Chief may question and utterly disregard his order and set aside his
</p>
<p>authority, is it possible, in the nature of things, that any body of men,
</p>
<p>constituted and qualified as a tribunal of justice, can sit in judgment
</p>
<p>upon the proposition that they are not a court for any purpose, and
</p>
<p>finally decide judicially, as a court, that the government which ap
</p>
<p>pointed them was without authority ? Why not crown the absurdity
</p>
<p>of this proposition by asking the several members of this court to
</p>
<p>determine that they are not men  living, intelligent, responsible
</p>
<p>men 1 This would be no more irrational than the question upon which
</p>
<p>they are asked to pass. How can any sensible man entertain it?
</p>
<p>Before he begins to reason upon the proposition he must take for
</p>
<p>granted, and therefore decide in advance, the very question in dis
</p>
<p>pute, to wit, his actual existence.
</p>
<p>So with the question presented in this remarkable argument for
</p>
<p>the defence : before this court can enter upon the inquiry of the want
</p>
<p>of authority in the President to constitute them a court, they must
</p>
<p>take for granted and decide the very point in issue, that the President
</p>
<p>had the authority, and that they are in law and in fact a judicial
</p>
<p>tribunal ; and having assumed this, they are gravely asked, as such
</p>
<p>judicial tribunal, to finally and solemnly decide and declare that they
</p>
<p>are not in fact or in law a judicial tribunal, but a mere nullity and
</p>
<p>nonentity. A most lame and impotent conclusion !
</p>
<p>. As the learned counsel seems to have great reverence for judi
</p>
<p>cial authority, and requires precedent for every opinion, I may
</p>
<p>be pardoned for saying that the objection which I urge, against
</p>
<p>the possibility of any judicial tribunal, after being officially quali
</p>
<p>fied as such, entertaining, much less judicially deciding, the pro
</p>
<p>position that it has no legal existence as a court, and that the
</p>
<p>appointment was a usurpation and without authority of law, has been

</p>
<p>solemnly ruled by the Supreme Court of the United States.
</p>
<p>That court say : "The acceptance of the judicial office is a recogni
</p>
<p>tion of the authority from which it is derived. If a court should enter
</p>
<p>upon the inquiry (whether the authority of the government which
</p>
<p>established it existed,) and should come to the conclusion that the
</p>
<p>government under which :* "n*^nA ^"-* v.o "+ QO;/io ,-*, nilu ^ase
</p>
<p>9
</p>
<p>to be a court and be incapable of pronouncing a judicial decision upon
</p>
<p>the question it undertook to try . If it decides at all, as a court, it
</p>
<p>necessarily affirms the existence and authority of the government
</p>
<p>under which it is exercising judicial power."  (Luther vs. Borden, 1
</p>
<p>Howard, 40.)
</p>
<p>That is the -very question raised by the learned gentleman in his
</p>
<p>argument  that there was no authority in the President, by whose
</p>
<p>act alone this tribunal was constituted, to vest it with judicial power
</p>
<p>to try this issue ; and by the order upon your record, as has already
</p>
<p>been shown, if you have no power to try this issue for want of author
</p>
<p>ity in the Commander-in-Chief to constitute you a court, you are no
</p>
<p>court, and have no power to try any issue, because his order limits
</p>
<p>you to this issue, and this alone.
</p>
<p>It requires no very profound legal attainments to apply the ruling
</p>
<p>of the highest judicial tribunal of this country, just cited, to the
</p>
<p>point raised, not by the pleadings, but by the argument. This court
</p>
<p>exists as a judicial tribunal by authority only of the President of the
</p>
<p>United States ; the acceptance of the office is an acknowledgment of
</p>
<p>the validity of the authority conferring it, and if the President had
</p>
<p>no authority to order, direct, and constitute this court to try the ac
</p>
<p>cused, and, as is claimed, did, in so constituting it, perform an uncon
</p>
<p>stitutional and illegal act, it necessarily results that the order of the
</p>
<p>President is void and of no effect; that the order did not and could
</p>
<p>not constitute this a tribunal of justice, and therefore its members
</p>
<p>are incapable of pronouncing a judicial decision upon the question
</p>
<p>presented. There is a marked distinction between the, question here
</p>
<p>presented and that raised by a plea to the jurisdiction of
</p>
<p>a tribunal whose existence as a court is neither questioned
</p>
<p>nor denied. Here it is argued, through many pages, by a learned
</p>
<p>Senator, and a distinguished lawyer, that the order of the President,
</p>
<p>by whose authority alone this court is constituted a tribunal of mili
</p>
<p>tary justice, is unlawful ; if unlawful it is void and of no effect, and
</p>
<p>has created no court; therefore this body, not being a court, can have
</p>
<p>no more power as a court to decide any question whatever than have its
</p>
<p>individual members power to decide that they as men do not in fact

<p>exist. It is a maxim of the common law  the perfection of human reason-
</p>
<p>that what is impossible the law requires of no man. ' ;^
</p>
<p>How can it be possible that a judicial tribunal can decide the
</p>
<p>10
</p>
<p>question that it does not exist, any more than that a rational man can
</p>
<p>decide that he does not exist?
</p>
<p>The absurdity of the proposition so elaborately urged upon the
</p>
<p>consideration of this court cannot be saved from the ridicule and con
</p>
<p>tempt of sensible men by the pretence that the court is not asked
</p>
<p>judicially to decide that it is not a court, but only that it has no
</p>
<p>jurisdiction; for it is a fact not to be denied that the whole argument
</p>
<p>for the defence on this point is that the President had not the law
</p>
<p>ful authority to issue the order by which alone this court is constitu
</p>
<p>ted, and that the order for its creationJs null and void.
</p>
<p>Gentlemen might as well ask the Supreme Court of the United
</p>
<p>States upon a plea to the jurisdiction to decide, as a court, that the
</p>
<p>President had no lawful authority to nominate the judges thereof
</p>
<p>severally to the Senate, and that the Senate had no lawful authority
</p>
<p>to advise and consent to their appointment, as to ask this court to
</p>
<p>decide, as a court, that the order of the President of the United States
</p>
<p>constituting it a tribunal for the sole purpose of this trial was not
</p>
<p>only without authority of law, but against and in violation of law. If
</p>
<p>this court is not a lawful tribunal, it has no existence, and can no
</p>
<p>more speak as a court than the dead, much less pronounce the judg
</p>
<p>ment required at its hands  that it is not a court, and that the Pres
</p>
<p>ident of the United States, in constituting it such to try the question
</p>
<p>upon the charge and specification preferred, has transcended his
</p>
<p>authority, and violated his oath of office.
</p>
<p>Before passing from the consideration of the proposition of the
</p>
<p>learned senator, that this is not a court, it is fit that I should notice
</p>
<p>that another of the counsel for the accused (Mr. Ewing) has also ad
</p>
<p>vanced the same opinion, certainly with more directness and candor,
</p>
<p>and without any qualification. His statement is, ' ' You, ' ' gentlemen
</p>
<p>"are no court under the Constitution." This remark of the gentle
</p>
<p>man cannot fail to excite surprise, when it is remembered that the
</p>
<p>gentleman, not many months since, was a general in the service of
</p>
<p>the country, and as such in his department in the west proclaimed
</p>
<p>and enforced martial law by the constitution of militarv tribunals for
</p>
<p>the trial of citizens not in the land or naval forces, but who were

</p>
<p>guilty of military offences, for which he deemed them justly punish
</p>
<p>able before military courts, and accordingly he punished them. Is
</p>
<p>the gentleman quite sure, when that account comes to be rendered
</p>
<p>for these alleged unconstitutional assumptions of power, that he will
</p>
<p>not have to answer for more of these alleged violations of the rights
</p>
<p>of citizens by illegal arrests, convictions, and executions, than any of
</p>
<p>11
</p>
<p>the members of this court? In support of his opinion that this is no
</p>
<p>court, the gentleman cites the 3d article of the Constitution, which
</p>
<p>provides "that the judicial power of the United States shall be vest
</p>
<p>ed in one supreme court, and such inferior courts as Congress may
</p>
<p>establish," the judges whereof "shall hold their offices during good
</p>
<p>behavior." It is a sufficient answer to say to the gentleman, that the power of
</p>
<p>this government to try and punish military offences by military tribu
</p>
<p>nals is no part of the "judicial power of the United States," under
</p>
<p>the 3d article of the Constitution, but a power conferred by the 8th
</p>
<p>section of the 1st article, and so it has been ruled by the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>in Dyres vs. Hoover, 20 Howard, 78. If this power is so conferred
</p>
<p>by the 8th section, a military court authorized by Congress, and con
</p>
<p>stituted as this has been, to try all persons for military crimes in
</p>
<p>time of war, though not exercising " the judicial power" provided
</p>
<p>for in the 3d article, is nevertheless a court as constitutional as the
</p>
<p>Supreme Court itself. The gentleman admits this to the extent of
</p>
<p>the trial by courts-martial of persons in the military or naval ser
</p>
<p>vice, and by admitting it he gives up the point. There is no express
</p>
<p>grant for any such tribunal, and the power to establish such a court,
</p>
<p>therefore, is implied from the provisions of the 8th section, 1st article,
</p>
<p>that " Congress shall have power to provide and maintain a navy,"
</p>
<p>' and also ''' to make rules for the government of the land and naval
</p>
<p>forces." From, these grants the Supreme Court infer the power to
</p>
<p>establish courts-martial, and from the grants in the same 8th section,
</p>
<p>as I shall notice hereafter, that " Congress shall have power to de
</p>
<p>clare war," and "to pass all laws necessary and proper to carry this
</p>
<p>and all other powers into effect," it is necessarily implied that in
</p>
<p>time of war Congress may authorize military commissions, to try all
</p>
<p>crimes committed in aid of the public enemy, as such tribunals are
</p>
<p>necessary to give effect to the power to make war and suppress insur
</p>
<p>rection. Inasmuch as the gentleman (Gen. Ewing,) for whom, personally, I
</p>
<p>have a high regard as the military commander of a western depart
</p>
<p>ment, made a liberal exercise, under the order of the Commander-
</p>
<p>in-Chief of the army, of this power to arrest and try military of
</p>
<p>fenders not in the land or naval forces of the United States, and

<p>inflicted upon them, as I am informed, the extreme penalty of the
</p>
<p>law, by virtue of his military jurisdiction, I wish to know whether fie
</p>
<p>proposes, by his proclamation of the personal responsibility awaiting
</p>
<p>all such usurpations of judicial authority, that he himself shall be
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>subjected to the same stern judgment which he invokes against
</p>
<p>others  that, in short, he shall be drawn and quartered for inflicting,
</p>
<p>the extreme penalties of the law upon citizens of the United States
</p>
<p>in violation of the Constitution and laws of his country? I trust that
</p>
<p>his error of judgment in pronouncing this military jurisdiction a usur
</p>
<p>pation and violation of the Constitution may not rise up in judgment
</p>
<p>to condemn him, and that he may never be subjected to pains and
</p>
<p>penalties for having done his duty heretofore in exercising this right
</p>
<p>ful authority, and in bringing  to judgment those who conspired
</p>
<p>against the lives and liberties of the people.
</p>
<p>Here I might leave this question, committing it to the charitable
</p>
<p>speeches of men, but for the fact that the learned counsel has been
</p>
<p>more careful in his extraordinary argument to denounce the Presi
</p>
<p>dent as a usurper than to show how the court could possibly decide
</p>
<p>that it has no judicial existence, and yet that it has judicial existence.
</p>
<p>A representative of the people and of the rights of the people be
</p>
<p>fore this court, by the appointment of the President, and which ap
</p>
<p>pointment was neither sought by me nor desired, I cannot allow all
</p>
<p>that has here been said by way of denunciation of the murdered Presi
</p>
<p>dent and his successor to pass unnoticed. This has been made the occa
</p>
<p>sion by the learned counsel, Mr. Johnson, to volunteer, not to defend the
</p>
<p>accused, Mary-E. Surratt, not to make a judicial argument in her behalf,
</p>
<p>but to make a political harangue, a partisan speech against his gov
</p>
<p>ernment and country, and thereby swell the cry of the armed legions
</p>
<p>of sedition and rebellion that but yesterday shook the heavens with
</p>
<p>their infernal enginery of treason and filled the habitations of the people
</p>
<p>with death. As the law forbids a senator of the United States to re
</p>
<p>ceive compensation, or fee, for defending, in cases before civil or mili
</p>
<p>tary commissions, the gentleman volunteers to make a speech before
</p>
<p>this court, in which he denounces the action of the Executive Depart
</p>
<p>ment in proclaiming and executing martial law against rebels in arms,
</p>
<p>their aiders and abettors, as a usurpation and a tyranny. I deem it
</p>
<p>my duty to reply to this denunciation, not for the purpose of present
</p>
<p>ing thereby any question for the decision of this court, for I have
</p>
<p>shown" that the argument of the gentleman presents no question for

</p>
<p>its decision as a court; but to repel, as far as I may be able, the un
</p>
<p>just aspersion attempted to be cast upon the memory of our dead
</p>
<p>President, and upon the official conduct of his successor.
</p>
<p>I propose now to answer fully all that the gentleman (Mr. Johnson)
</p>
<p>has said of the want of jurisdiction in this court, and of the alleged
</p>
<p>usurpation and tyranny of the Executive, that the enlightened public
</p>
<p>13
</p>
<p>opinion to which he appeals may decide whether all this denunciation
</p>
<p>is, just  whether indeed conspiring against the whole people, and
</p>
<p>confederation and agreement in aid of insurrection to murder all the
</p>
<p>executive officers of the government, cannot be checked or arrested
</p>
<p>by the Executive power. Let the people decide this question ; and
</p>
<p>in doing so, let thenr pass upon the action of the senator as well as
</p>
<p>upon the action of those whom he so arrogantly arraigns. His plea
</p>
<p>in.bebalf of an expiring and shattered rebellion is a fit subject for
</p>
<p>public consideration and for public condemnation.
</p>
<p>Let that people also note, that while the learned gentleman, (Mr.
</p>
<p>Johnson,) as a volunteer, without pay, thus condemns as a usurpa
</p>
<p>tion the means employed so effectually to suppress this gigantic insur
</p>
<p>rection, the New York News, whose proprietor, Benjamin Wood, is
</p>
<p>shown by the testimony upon your record to have received from the
</p>
<p>agents of the rebellion twenty -five thousand dollars, rushes into the
</p>
<p>lists to champion the cause of the rebellion, its aiders and abettors,
</p>
<p>by following to the letter his colleague, (Mr. Johnson,) and with greater
</p>
<p>plainness of speech, and a fervor intensified, doubtless, by the twenty-
</p>
<p>five thousand dollars received, and the hope of more, denounces the
</p>
<p>court as a usurpation and threatens the members with the conse
</p>
<p>quences !
</p>
<p>The argument of the gentleman to which the court has listened so
</p>
<p>patiently and so long is but an attempt to show that it is unconsti
</p>
<p>tutional for the government of the United States to arrest upon mil
</p>
<p>itary order and try before military tribunals and punish upon convic
</p>
<p>tion, in accordance with the laws of war and the usages of nations, all
</p>
<p>criminal offenders acting in aid of the existing rebellion. It does
</p>
<p>seem to me that the speech in its tone and temper is the same, as that
</p>
<p>which the country has heard for the last four years uttered by the
</p>
<p>armed rebels themselves and by their apologists, averring that it was
</p>
<p>unconstitutional for the government of the United States to defend by
</p>
<p>arms its own rightful authority and the supremacy of its laws.
</p>
<p>It is as clearly the right of the republic to live and to defend its life
</p>
<p>until it forfeits that right by crime, as it is the right of the individual
</p>
<p>to live so long as God gives him life, unless he forfeits that right by

</p>
<p>crime. I make no argument to support this proposition. Who is
</p>
<p>there here or elsewhere to cast the reproach upon my country that
</p>
<p>for her crimes she must die ? Youngest born of the nations ! is she
</p>
<p>not immortal by all the dread memories of the past  by that sublime
</p>
<p>and voluntary sacrifice of the present, in which the bravest and no
</p>
<p>blest of her sons have laid down their lives that she might live, giving
</p>
<p>14
</p>
<p>their serene brows to the dust of the grave, and lifting their hands
</p>
<p>for the last time amidst the consuming fires of battle ! I assume, for
</p>
<p>the purposes of this argument, that self-defence is as clearly the right
</p>
<p>of nations as it is the acknowledged right of men, and that the Amer
</p>
<p>ican people may do in the defence and maintenance of their own
</p>
<p>rightful authority against organized armed rebels, their aiders and
</p>
<p>abettors, whatever free and independent nations anywhere upon this
</p>
<p>globe, in time of war, may of right do.
</p>
<p>All this is substantially denied by the gentleman in the remarkable
</p>
<p>argument which he has here made. There is nothing further from
</p>
<p>my purpose than to do injustice to the learned gentleman or to his
</p>
<p>elaborate and ingenious argument. To justify what I have already
</p>
<p>said, I may be permitted here to remind the court that nothing is
</p>
<p>said by the counsel touching the conduct of the accused, Mary E.
</p>
<p>Surratt, as shown by the testimony ; that he makes confession at the
</p>
<p>end of his arraignment of the government and country, that he has
</p>
<p>not made such argument, and that he leaves it to be made by her
</p>
<p>other counsel. He does take care, however, to arraign the country
</p>
<p>and the government for conducting a trial with closed doors and
</p>
<p>before a secret tribunal, and compares the proceedings of this court
</p>
<p>to the Spanish Inquisition, using the strongest words at his command
</p>
<p>to intensify the horror which he supposes his announcement will
</p>
<p>excite throughout the civilized world.
</p>
<p>Was this, dealing fairly by this government? Was there anything
</p>
<p>in the conduct of the proceedings here that justified any such remark?
</p>
<p>Has this been a secret trial ? Has it not been conducted in open day
</p>
<p>in the presence of the accused, and in the presence of seven gentle
</p>
<p>men learned in the law, who appeared from day to day as their
</p>
<p>counsel ? Were they not informed of the accusation against them ?
</p>
<p>Were they deprived of the right of challenge? Was it not secured
</p>
<p>to them bylaw, and were they not asked to exercise it? Has any
</p>
<p>part of the evidence been suppressed? Have not all the proceed
</p>
<p>ings been published to the world ? What, then, was done, or intended
</p>
<p>to be done, by the government, which justifies this clamor about a
</p>
<p>Spanish Inquisition ?

<p>That a people.assailed by organized treason over an extent of ter
</p>
<p>ritory half as large as the continent of Europe, and assailed in their
</p>
<p>very capital by secret assassins banded together and hired to do the
</p>
<p>' work of murder by the instigation of these conspirators, may not
</p>
<p>be permitted to make inquiry, even with closed doors, touching the
</p>
<p>nature and extent of the organization, ought not to be asserted by
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>any gentleman who makes the least pretensions to any knowledge of
</p>
<p>the law, either common, civil, or military. Who does not know that
</p>
<p>at the common law all inquisition touching crimes and misdemean
</p>
<p>ors, preparatory to indictment by the grand inquest of the state,
</p>
<p>is made with closed doors?
</p>
<p>In this trial no parties accused, nor their counsel, nor the reporters
</p>
<p>of this court, were at any time excluded from its deliberations when
</p>
<p>any testimony was beiug taken ; nor has there been any testimony
</p>
<p>taken in the case with closed doors, save that of a few witnesses, who
</p>
<p>testified, not in regard to the accused or either of them, but in re
</p>
<p>spect to the traitors 6nd conspirators not on trial, who were alleged
</p>
<p>to have incited this crime. Who is there to say that the American
</p>
<p>people, in time of armed rebellion and civil war, have not the right
</p>
<p>to make such an examination as secretly as they may deem neces
</p>
<p>sary, either in a military or civil court ?
</p>
<p>I have said this, not by way of apology for anything the govern
</p>
<p>ment has done, or attempted to do in the progress of this trial, but to
</p>
<p>expose the animus of the argument, and to repel the accusation against
</p>
<p>my country sent out to the world by the counsel. From anything
</p>
<p>that he has said,, I have yet to learn that the American people have
</p>
<p>not the right to make their inquiries secretly, touching a general con
</p>
<p>spiracy in. aid of an existing rebellion, which involves their nationality
</p>
<p>and the peace and security of all.
</p>
<p>The gentleman then enters into a learned argument for the purpose
</p>
<p>of showing that, by the Constitution, the people of the United States
</p>
<p>cannot, in war or in peace, subject any person to trial before a mili
</p>
<p>tary tribunal, whatever may be his crime or offence, unless such per- <
</p>
<p>son be in the military or naval service of the United States. The
</p>
<p>conduct of this argument is as remarkable as its assaults upon the
</p>
<p>government are unwarranted, and its insinuations about the revival
</p>
<p>of the Inquisition and secret trials are inexcusable. The court will
</p>
<p>notice that the argument, from the beginning almost to its conclusion,
</p>
<p>insists that no person is liable to be tried by military or martial law
</p>
<p>before a military tribunal, save those in the land and naval service of
</p>
<p>the United States. I repeat, the conduct of this argument of the

</p>
<p>gentleman is remarkable. As an instance, I ask the attention, not
</p>
<p>only of this court, but of that public whom he has ventured to address
</p>
<p>in this tone and temper, to the authority of the distinguished Chancellor
</p>
<p>Kent, whose great name the counsel has endeavored to press into his
</p>
<p>service in support of his general proposition, that no person save
</p>
<p>those in the military or naval service of the United States is liable to
</p>
<p>16
</p>
<p>be tried for any crime whatever, either in peace or in war, before a
</p>
<p>military tribunal.
</p>
<p>The language of the gentleman, after citing the provision of the Con
</p>
<p>stitution, ' ' that no person shall be held to answer for a capital or other
</p>
<p>wise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand
</p>
<p>jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the
</p>
<p>militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger," is,
</p>
<p>' ' that this exception is designed to leave in force, not to enlarge, the
</p>
<p>power vested in Congress by the original Constitution to make rules
</p>
<p>for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces; that
</p>
<p>the land or naval forces are the terms used in both, have the same
</p>
<p>meaning, and until lately have been supposed by every commentator
</p>
<p>and judge to exclude from military jurisdiction offences committed by
</p>
<p>citizens not belonging to such forces." The learned gentleman then
</p>
<p>adds: "Kent, in a note to his 1st Commentaries, 341 , states, and
</p>
<p>with accuracy, that 'military and naval crimes and offences, com
</p>
<p>mitted while the party is attached to and under the immediate, au
</p>
<p>thority of the army and navy of the United States and in actual
</p>
<p>service, are not cognizable under the common-law jurisdiction of the
</p>
<p>courts of the United States.' " I ask this court to bear in mind that
</p>
<p>this is the only passage which he quotes from this note of Kent in
</p>
<p>his argument, and that no man possessed of common sense, however
</p>
<p>destitute he may be of the exact and varied learning in the law to
</p>
<p>which the gentleman may rightfully lay claim, can for a moment en
</p>
<p>tertain the opinion that the distinguished chancellor of New York, in
</p>
<p>the passage just cited, intimates any such thing as the counsel asserts, ,
</p>
<p>' that the Constitution excludes from military jurisdiction offences com
</p>
<p>mitted by citizens not belonging to the land or naval forces.
</p>
<p>Who can fail to see that Chancellor Kent, by the passage cited,
</p>
<p>only decides that military and naval crimes and offences committed!
</p>
<p>by a party attached to and under the immediate authority of the
</p>
<p>army and navy of the United States, and in actual service, are not
</p>
<p>cognizable under the common-law jurisdiction of the courts of the
</p>
<p>United States ? He only says they are not cognizable under its com
</p>
<p>mon-law jurisdiction; but by that he does not say or intimate, what'

</p>
<p>is attempted to be said by the counsel for him, that ' ' all crimes
</p>
<p>committed by citizens are by the Constitution excluded from military
</p>
<p>jurisdiction," and that the perpetrators of them can under no circum
</p>
<p>stances be tried before military tribunals. Yet the counsel ventures

<p>every other species of offences are within the jurisdiction of the civil

</p>
<p>Whatever that great authority may have said elsewhere, it is very
</p>
<p>doubtful ' whether any candid man in America will be able to come
</p>
<p>to the very learned and astute conclusion that Chancellor Kent has
</p>
<p>so stated in the note or any part of the note which the gentleman
</p>
<p>has just cited. If he has said it elsewhere, it is for the gentleman,
</p>
<p>if he relies upon Kent for authority, to produce the passage. But
</p>
<p>was it fair treatment of this "great authority" was it not taking
</p>
<p>an unwarrantable privilege with the distinguished chancellor and his
</p>
<p>great work, the enduring monument of his learning and genius, to so
</p>
<p>mutilate the note referred to, as might leave the gentleman at liberty
</p>
<p>to make his deductions and assertions under cover of the great name
</p>
<p>of the New York chancellor, to suit the emergency of his case, by
</p>
<p>omitting the following passage, which occurs in the same note, and
</p>
<p>absolutely excludes the conclusion so defiantly put forth by the counsel
</p>
<p>to support his argument ? In that note Chancellor Kent says :
</p>
<p>1 ' Military law is a system of regulations for the government of the
</p>
<p>armies in the service of the United States, authorized by the act of
</p>
<p>Congress of April 10, 1806, known as the Articles of War, and naval
</p>
<p>law is a similar system for the government of the navy, under the
</p>
<p>act of Congress of April 23, 1800. But martial law is quite a distinct
</p>
<p>thing, and is founded upon paramount necessity, and proclaimed by
</p>
<p>a military chief."
</p>
<p>However unsuccessful, after this exposure, the gentleman appears
</p>
<p>in maintaining his monstrous proposition, that the American people
</p>
<p>are by their own Constitution forbidden to try the aiders and abettors
</p>
<p>of armed traitors and rebellion before military tribunals, and subject
</p>
<p>them, according to the laws of war and the usages of nations, to just
</p>
<p>punishment for their great crimes, it has been made clear from what
</p>
<p>I have already stated that he has been eminently successful in muti
</p>
<p>lating this beautiful production of that great mind; which act of mu

</p>
<p>war. Even in war the divine creations of art and the immortal pro
</p>
<p>ductions of genius and learning are spared.
</p>
<p>In the same spirit, and it seems to me with the same unfairness as
</p>
<p>that just noted, the learned gentleman has very adroitly pressed into
</p>
<p>, his service, by an extract from the autobiography of the war-worn
</p>
<p>2b
</p>
<p>18
</p>
<p>veteran and hero, General Scott, the names of the late Secretary of
</p>
<p>War, Mr. Marcy, and the learned ex- Attorney General, Mr. Cushing.
</p>
<p>This adroit performance is achieved in this way: after stating the
</p>
<p>fact that General Scott in Mexico proclaimed martial law for the
</p>
<p>trial and punishment by military tribunals of persons guilty of
</p>
<p>"assassination, murder, and poisoning," the gentleman proceeds. to
</p>
<p>quote from the Autobiography, "that this order, when handed to the
</p>
<p>then Secretary of War (Mr. Marcy) for his approval, ' a startle at the
</p>
<p>title (martial law order) was the only comment he then or ever made
</p>
<p>on the subject,' and that it was 'soon silently returned as too explo
</p>
<p>sive for safe handling.' 'A little later (he adds) the Attorney Gen
</p>
<p>eral (Mr. Cushing) called and asked for a copy, and the law officer of
</p>
<p>the government, whose business it is to speak on all such matters,
</p>
<p>was stricken with legal dumbness.'" Thereupon the learned gentle
</p>
<p>man proceeds to say: "How much more startled and more paralyzed
</p>
<p>would these great men have been had they been consulted on such a
</p>
<p>commission as this! A commission, not to sit in another country, and
</p>
<p>to try offences not provided for in any law of the United States, civil
</p>
<p>or military, then in force, but in their own country, and in a part
</p>
<p>of it where there are laws providing for their trial and punishment,
</p>
<p>and civil courts clothed with ample powers for both, and in the daily
</p>
<p>and undisturbed exercise of their jurisdiction."
</p>
<p>I think I may safely say, without stopping to make any special ref
</p>
<p>erences, that the official career of the late Secretary of War (Mr.
</p>
<p>Marcy) gave no indication that he ever doubted or denied the con
</p>
<p>stitutional power of , the American people, acting through their duly
</p>
<p>constituted agents, to do any act justified by the laws of war, for the
</p>
<p>suppression of a rebellion or to repel invasion. Certainly there is
</p>
<p>nothing in this extract from the Autobiography which justifies any
</p>
<p>such conclusion. He was startled, we are told. It may have been
</p>
<p>as much the admiration he had for the boldness and wisdom of the
</p>
<p>conqueror of Mexico as any abhorrence he had for the trial and pun
</p>
<p>ishment of "assassins, poisoners, and murderers," according to the
</p>
<p>laws and usages of war.

<p>with which the gentleman doubtless was familiar when he prepared
</p>
<p>this argument, by no means justify the attempt here made to quote
</p>
<p>him as authority against tho proclamation and enforcement of mar
</p>
<p>tial law in time of rebellion and civil war. That distinguished man
</p>
<p>not second in legal attainments to any who have held that position,
</p>
<p>has left an official opinion of record touching this subject. Eeferring
</p>
<p>19
</p>
<p>to what is said by Sir Mathew Hale, in his History of- the -Common
</p>
<p>Law, concerning martial law, wherein he limits it, as the gentleman
</p>
<p>has seemed by the whole drift of his argument desirous of doing, and
</p>
<p>says that it is "not in truth and. in reality law, but something in
</p>
<p>dulged rather than allowed as a law the necessity of government,
</p>
<p>order, and discipline in an army," Mr. Cushing makes this just criti
</p>
<p>cism : "This proposition is a mere composite blunder, a total mis
</p>
<p>apprehension of the matter. It confounds martial law and law mili
</p>
<p>tary; it ascribes to the former the uses of the latter ; it erroneously
</p>
<p>assumes that the government of a body of troops is a necessity more
</p>
<p>than of a body of civilians or citizens. It confounds and confuses all
</p>
<p>the relations of the subject, and is an apt illustration of the. incom
</p>
<p>pleteness of the notions of the common-law jurists of England in re
</p>
<p>gard to matters not comprehended in that limited branch of legal
</p>
<p>science. * * * Military law; it is now perfectly understood in
</p>
<p>England, is a branch of the law of the land, applicable only to certain
</p>
<p>acts of a particular class of persons and administered by special
</p>
<p>tribunals ; but neither in that nor in any other respect essentially
</p>
<p>differing as to foundation in constitutional reason from admiralty,
</p>
<p>ecclesiastical, or indeed chancery and common law. * * *
</p>
<p>It is the system of rules for the government of the army and navy
</p>
<p>established by successive acts of Parliament. * * * *
</p>
<p>Martial law, as exercised in any country by the commander of a
</p>
<p>foreign army, is an element of the^MS belli.
</p>
<p>" It is incidental to the state of solemn war, and appertains to the
</p>
<p>law of nations. * * Thus, while the armies of the United
</p>
<p>States occupied different provinces of the Mexican republic, the
</p>
<p>respective commanders were not limited in authority by any local
</p>
<p>law. They allowed, or rather required, the magistrates of the coun
</p>
<p>try, municipal or judicial, to continue to administer the laws of the
</p>
<p>country among their countrymen ; but in subjection, always, to the
</p>
<p>military power, which acted summarily and according to discretion,
</p>
<p>when the belligerent interests of the conqueror required it, and
</p>
<p>which exercised jurisdiction,- either summarily or by means of mili
</p>
<p>tary commissions for the protection or the punishment of citizens of

<p>the United States in Mexico."  Opinions of Attorneys General, vol.
</p>
<p>viii, 366-369.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cushing says, ' ' That, it would seem, was one of the forms of
</p>
<p>martial law ;" but he adds, that such an example of martial law ad
</p>
<p>ministered by a foreign army in the enemy's country "does not en-
</p>
<p>20
</p>
<p>lighten us in regard to the question of martial law in one's own coun
</p>
<p>try, and as administered by its military commanders. That is a case
</p>
<p>which the law of nations does not reach. Its regulation is of the do
</p>
<p>mestic resort of the organic laws of the country itself, and regarding
</p>
<p>which, as it happens, there is no definite Or explicit legislation in the
</p>
<p>United States, as there is none in England.
</p>
<p>"Accordingly, in England, as we have seen, Earl Grey assumes that
</p>
<p>when martial law exists it has no legal origin, but is a mere fact of
</p>
<p>necessity, to be legalized afterwards by a bill of indemnity, if there
</p>
<p>be occasion. I am not prepared to say that, under existing laws,
</p>
<p>such may not also be the case in the United States."  Ibid., 370.
</p>
<p>After such a statement, wherein ex- Attorney General Cushing very
</p>
<p>clearly recognizes the right of this government, as also of England,
</p>
<p>to employ martial law as a means of defence in a time of war, whether
</p>
<p>domestic or foreign, he will be as much surprised when he reads the
</p>
<p>argument of the learned gentleman, wherein he is described as being
</p>
<p>struck with legal dumbness at the mere mention of proclaiming martial
</p>
<p>law, and its enforcement by the commander of our army in Mexico,
</p>
<p>as the late Secretary of War was startled with even the mention of
</p>
<p>its title.
</p>
<p>Even some of the reasons given, and certainly the power exercised
</p>
<p>by the veteran hero himself, would seem to be in direct conflict with
</p>
<p>the propositions of the learned gentleman.
</p>
<p>The Lieutenant General says, he ' ' excludes from his order cases
</p>
<p>already cognizable by court-martial, and limits it to cases not pro
</p>
<p>vided for in the act of Congress establishing rules and articles for the
</p>
<p>government of the armies of the United States." Has not the gen
</p>
<p>tleman who attempts to press General Scott into his service argued
</p>
<p>and insisted upon it, that the commander of the army cannot subject
</p>
<p>the soldiers under his command to any control or punishment what
</p>
<p>ever, save that which is provided for in the articles ?
</p>
<p>It will not do, in order to sustain the gentleman's hypothesis, to say
</p>
<p>that these provisions of the Constitution, by which he attempts to
</p>
<p>fetter the power of the people to punish such offences in time of war
</p>
<p>within the territory of the United States, may be disregarded by an

</p>
<p>officer of the United States in command of its armies, in the trial and
</p>
<p>punishment of its soldiers in a foreign war. The law of the United
</p>
<p>States for the government of its own armies follows the flag upon
</p>
<p>every sea and in every land.
</p>
<p>The truth is, that the right of the people to proclaim and execute
</p>
<p>martial law is a necessary incident of war, and this was the right4
</p>
<p>21
</p>
<p>exercised, and rightfully exercised, by Lieutenant General Scott in
</p>
<p>Mexico: It was what Earl Grey has justly said was a "fact of ne
</p>
<p>cessity," and I may add, an act as clearly authorized as was the act
</p>
<p>of fighting the enemy when they appeared before him.
</p>
<p>In making this exception, the Lieutenant General followed the rule
</p>
<p>recognized by the American- authorities on military law, in which
</p>
<p>it is declared that "many crimes committed even by military officers,
</p>
<p>enlisted men, or camp retainers, cannot be tried under the rules and
</p>
<p>articles of war. Military commissions must be resorted to for such
</p>
<p>cases, and these commissions should be ordered by the same authority,
</p>
<p>be constituted in a similar manner, and- their proceedings be con
</p>
<p>ducted according to the same general rules as general courts-mar
</p>
<p>tial." Benet, 1.5.
</p>
<p>There remain for me to notice, at present, two other points
</p>
<p>in this extraordinary speech : . first, that martial law does not warrant
</p>
<p>a military commission for the trial of military offences^-4that is, offences
</p>
<p>committed in time of war in the interests of the public enemy, and
</p>
<p>by concert and agreement with the enemy; and second, that martial
</p>
<p>law .does not prevail in the United States, and has never been declared
</p>
<p>by any competent authority.
</p>
<p>It is not necessary, as the gentleman himself has declined to argue
</p>
<p>the first point,  whether martial law authorizes' the organization of
</p>
<p>military commissions by order- of the Commander-in-Chief to try such
</p>
<p>offences, that J. should say more than that the authority just cited by
</p>
<p>me shows that such commissions are authorized under martial law,
</p>
<p>and are created by the commander for the trial of all such offences,
</p>
<p>when their punishment by court-martial is not provided for by the
</p>
<p>express statute law of the country.
</p>
<p>The second point,  that martial law has not been declared by any
</p>
<p>competent authority, is an arraignment of the late murdered Pres
</p>
<p>ident of the United States for his proclamation, of September 24,
</p>
<p>1862, declaring martial law throughout the United States; and of which,
</p>
<p>in Lawrence's edition of Wheaton on International Law, p. 522, it is
</p>
<p>said, " Whatever may be the inference to be deduced either from
</p>
<p>constitutional or international law, or from the usages of European

<p>governments, as to the legitimate depository of the power of suspend
</p>
<p>ing the writ of habeas corpus, the virtual abrogation of the judiciary
</p>
<p>in cases affecting individual liberty, and the establishment as matter
</p>
<p>of fact in the United States, by the Executive alone, of martial law,
</p>
<p>not merely in the insurrectionary districts, or in cases of military
</p>
<p>occupancy, but throughout the entire Union, and not temporarily,
</p>
<p>22
</p>
<p>but as an institution as permanent as the insurrection on which it
</p>
<p>professes to be based, and capable on the same principle of being
</p>
<p>revived in all cases of foreign as well as civil war, are placed beyond
</p>
<p>question by the President's proclamation of September 24, 1862."
</p>
<p>That proclamation is as follows :
</p>
<p>"BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
</p>
<p>"A PROCLAMATION.
</p>
<p>" Whereas it has become necessary to call into service not only volunteers,
</p>
<p>but also portions of the militia of the States, by a draft, in order to suppress
</p>
<p>the insurrection existing in the United States, and disloyal persons are not ade
</p>
<p>quately restrained by the ordinary processes of law from hindering this measure,
</p>
<p>and from giving aid and comfort in various ways to the insurrection : Now,
</p>
<p>therefore, be it ordered, that during the existing insurrection, and as a necessary
</p>
<p>means for suppressing the same, all rebels "and insurgents, their aiders and abet
</p>
<p>tors, within the United States, and all persons discouraging volunteer enlist
</p>
<p>ments, resisting militia drafts, or guilty of any disloyal practice, affording aid
</p>
<p>and comfort to rebels, against the authority of the United States, shall be
</p>
<p>subject to martial law, and liable to trial and punishment by courts-martial or
</p>
<p>military commission.
</p>
<p>" Second. That the writ of habeas corpus is suspended in respect to all per
</p>
<p>sons arrested, or who are now, or hereafter during the rebellion shall be, impris
</p>
<p>oned in any fort, camp, arsenal, military prison, or other place of confine
</p>
<p>ment, by any military authority, or by the sentence of any court martial or
</p>
<p>military commission.
</p>
<p>" In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of
</p>
<p>the United States to be affixed.
</p>
<p>" Done at the city of Washington, this 24th day of September, A. D. 1862,
</p>
<p>and of the independence of the United States the eighty-seventh.
</p>
<p>"ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
</p>
<p>" By the President :
</p>
<p>"William H. Seward,
</p>
<p>" Secretary of State."
</p>
<p>This proclamation is duly certified from the War Department to be
</p>
<p>in full force and not revoked, and is evidence of record in this case;
</p>
<p>and but a few days since a proclamation of the President, of which

</p>
<p>this court will take notice, declares that the same remains in full force.
</p>
<p>It has been said by another of the counsel for the accused (Mr.
</p>
<p>Stone) in his argument, that, admitting its validity, the proclamation
</p>
<p>ceases to have effect with the insurrection, and is terminated by it.
</p>
<p>It is true the proclamation of martial law only continues during
</p>
<p>the insurrection; but inasmuch as the question of the existence of
</p>
<p>23
</p>
<p>an insurrection is a political question, the decision of which belongs
</p>
<p>exclusively to the political department of the government, that de
</p>
<p>partment alone can declare its existence, and that department alone
</p>
<p>can declare its termination, and by the action of the political depart
</p>
<p>ment of the government every judicial tribunal in the land is con
</p>
<p>cluded and bound. That question has been settled for fifty years
</p>
<p>in this country by the Supreme Court of the United States : First,
</p>
<p>in the case of Brown vs.' The United States (8 Cranch;) also in the prize
</p>
<p>cases (2 Black, 641.) Nothing more, therefore, need be said upon
</p>
<p>this question of an existing insurrection than this: The political de
</p>
<p>partment of the government has heretofore proclaimed an insurrection,
</p>
<p>that department has not yet declared the insurrection ended, and the
</p>
<p>event on the 14th of April, which robbed the people of their chosen
</p>
<p>Executive,' and clothed this land in mourning, bore sad but over
</p>
<p>whelming witness to the fact that the rebellion is not ended. The
</p>
<p>fact of the insurrection is not an open question to be tried or settled
</p>
<p>by parol, either in a military tribunal or in a civil court.
</p>
<p>The declaration of the learned gentleman who opened the defence,
</p>
<p>(Mr. Johnson,) that martial law has never been declared by any com
</p>
<p>petent authority, as I have already said,' arraigns Mr. Lincoln for a
</p>
<p>usurpation of power. Does the gentleman mean to say that, until
</p>
<p>Congress authorizes it, the President cannot proclaim and enforce
</p>
<p>martial law in the suppression of armed and organized rebellion ? Or
</p>
<p>does he only affirm that this act of the late President is a usurpation ?
</p>
<p>The proclamation of martial law in 1862 a usurpation 1 though
</p>
<p>it armed the people in that dark hour of trial with the means of de
</p>
<p>fence against traitorous and secret enemies in every State and dis
</p>
<p>trict of the country; though by its use some of the guilty were brought
</p>
<p>to swift and just judgment, and others deterred from crime or driven
</p>
<p>to flight; though by this means the innocent and defenceless were
</p>
<p>protected; though by this means the city of the gentleman's residence
</p>
<p>was saved from the violence and pillage of the .mob and the torch of
</p>
<p>the incendiary. But, says the gentleman, it was a usurpation, for
</p>
<p>bidden by the laws of the land !
</p>
<p>The same was said of the proclamations of blockade issued April

<p>19 and 27, 1861, which declared a blockade of the ports of the insur
</p>
<p>gent States, and that all vessels violating the same were subjects of
</p>
<p>capture, and, together with the cargo, to be condemned as prize. In
</p>
<p>asmuch as Congress had not then recognized the fact of civil war,
</p>
<p>these proclamations were denounced as void. The Supreme Court
</p>
<p>decided otherwise, and affirmed the power of the Executive thus to
</p>
<p>24
</p>
<p>subject property on the seas to seizure and condemnation. I read
</p>
<p>from that decision :
</p>
<p>"The Constitution confers upon the President the whole executive
</p>
<p>power; he is bound to take care that the laws be faithfully executed;
</p>
<p>he is commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States,
</p>
<p>and of the militia of the several States when called into the actual
</p>
<p>service of the United States. * * Whether the President, in ful
</p>
<p>filling his duties as commander-in-chief in suppressing an insurrec
</p>
<p>tion, has met with such armed hostile resistance, and a civil war of
</p>
<p>such alarming proportions' as will compel him to accord to them the
</p>
<p>character of belligerents, is a question to be decided by him, and this
</p>
<p>court must be governed by the decisions and acts of the political
</p>
<p>department of the government to which this power was intrusted.
</p>
<p>He must determine what degree of force the crisis demands.
</p>
<p>' ' The proclamation of blockade is itself official and conclusive evi
</p>
<p>dence to the court that a state of war existed which demanded and
</p>
<p>authorized a recourse to such a measure under the circumstances pe
</p>
<p>culiar to the case." (2 Black, 670.)
</p>
<p>It has been solemnly ruled by the same tribunal, in an earlier case,
</p>
<p>" that the power is confided to the Executive of the Union to deter
</p>
<p>mine when it is necessary to call out the militia of the States to repel
</p>
<p>invasion," as follows : " That he is necessarily constituted the judge
</p>
<p>of the existence of the exigency in the first instance, and is bound to
</p>
<p>act according to his belief of the facts. If he does so act, and
</p>
<p>decides to call forth the militia, his orders for this purpose are iu
</p>
<p>strict conformity with the provisions of the law ; and it would seem
</p>
<p>to follow as a necessary consequence, that every act done by a sub
</p>
<p>ordinate officer, in obedience to such orders, is equally justifiable.
</p>
<p>The law contemplates that, under such circumstances, orders shall be
</p>
<p>given to carry the power into effect ; and it cannot therefore be a
</p>
<p>correct inference- that any other person has a just right to disobey
</p>
<p>them. The law does not provide for any appeal from the judgment
</p>
<p>of the President, or for any right in subordinate officers to review his
</p>
<p>decision, and in effect defeat it. Whenever a statute gives a dis
</p>

<p>opinion of certain facts, it is a sound rule of construction, that the
</p>
<p>statute constitutes him the sole and exclusive judge of the existence
</p>
<p>of those facts." (12 Wheaton, 31.)
</p>
<p>In the light of these decisions, it must be clear to every mind that
</p>
<p>the question of the existence of an insurrection, and the necessity of
</p>
<p>calling into requisition for its suppression both the militia of the
</p>
<p>25
</p>
<p>States and the army and navy of the United States, and of proclaim
</p>
<p>ing martial law, which is an essential condition of war, whether
</p>
<p>foreign or domestic, must rest with the officer of the government who
</p>
<p>is charged by the express terms of the Constitution with the per
</p>
<p>formance of this great duty for the common defence and the execu
</p>
<p>tion of the laws of the Union.
</p>
<p>But it is further insisted by the gentleman in this argument, that
</p>
<p>Congress has not authorized the establishment of military commissions,
</p>
<p>which are essential to the judicial administration of martial law and
</p>
<p>the puUishment of crimes committed during the existence of a civil
</p>
<p>war, and especially, .that such commissions are not so authorized to. try
</p>
<p>persons other than those in the military or naval service of the United
</p>
<p>States, or in the militia of the several States, when in the actual service
</p>
<p>of the United States. The gentleman's argument assuredly destroys
</p>
<p>itself, for ho insists that the Congress, as the legislative department
</p>
<p>of the government, can pass no law which, either in peace or war, can
</p>
<p>constitutionally subject, any citizen not in the land or naval forces to
</p>
<p> trial for crime before a military tribunal, or otherwise than by a jury
</p>
<p>in the civil courts.
</p>
<p>Why does the learned gentleman now tell us that Congress has
</p>
<p>not authorized this to be done, after declaring just as stoutly that
</p>
<p>by the .fifth and sixth amendments to the Constitution no such military
</p>
<p>tribunals can be established for the trial of any person not in the
</p>
<p>military or naval service of the United States, or in the militia when
</p>
<p>in actual service, for the commission of any crime whatever in time
</p>
<p>of war or insurrection ? It ought to have occurred to the gentle
</p>
<p>man when commenting upon the exception in the fifth article of the
</p>
<p>Constitution, that there was a reason for it very different from that
</p>
<p>which he saw fit to assign, and that reason, manifestly upon the face
</p>
<p>of the Constitution itself, was, that by the eighth section of the first
</p>
<p>article, it is expressly provided, that Congress shall have power to
</p>
<p>make rules for the government of the land and naval forces, and to
</p>
<p>provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for
</p>
<p>governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the
</p>
<p>United States, and that, inasmuch as military discipline and order are

</p>
<p>as essential in an army in time of peace, as in time of war, if the
</p>
<p>Constitution would leave this power to Congress in peace, it must
</p>
<p>make the exception, so that rules and regulations for the government
</p>
<p>of the army and navy should be operative in time of peace as well as
</p>
<p>in time of war ; because the provisions of the Constitution give the
</p>
<p>right of trial by jury in time op peace, in all criminal prosecutions
</p>
<p>2G
</p>
<p>by indictment, in terms embracing every human being that may be
</p>
<p>held to answer for crime in the United States : and therefore if the
</p>
<p>eighth section of the first article was to remain in full force in time of
</p>
<p>peace, the exception must be made ; and accordingly, the exception
</p>
<p>was made. But by the argument we have listened to, this court is
</p>
<p>told, and the country is told, that in time of wak  a war which in
</p>
<p>volves in its dread issue the lives and interests of us all  the guaran
</p>
<p>tees of the Constitution are in full force for the benefit of thOye who
</p>
<p>conspire with the enemy, creep into your camps, murder in cold blood,
</p>
<p>in the interests of the invader or insurgent, the commander-in-chief of
</p>
<p>your army, and secure to him the slow and weak provisions of the civil
</p>
<p>law, while the soldier, who may, when overcome by the demands of
</p>
<p>exhausted nature, which cannot be resisted, have slept at his post, is
</p>
<p>subject to be tried; upon the spot by a military tribunal and shot. The
</p>
<p>argument amounts to this: that as military courts and military trials of
</p>
<p>civilians in time of war are a usurpation and tyranny, and as soldiers
</p>
<p>are liable to such arrests and trial, Sergeant Corbett, who shot Booth,
</p>
<p>should be tried and executed by sentence of a military court ; while
</p>
<p>Booth's co-conspirators and aiders should be saved from any such in
</p>
<p>dignity as a military trial ! I confess that I am too dull to compre
</p>
<p>hend the logic, the reason, orthe sense of such a conclusion ! If there
</p>
<p>is any one entitled to this privilege of a civil trial, at a remote period,
</p>
<p>and by a jury of the District, in time of civil war, when the foundations
</p>
<p>of the republic are rocking beneath the earthquake tread of armed
</p>
<p>rebellion, that man is the defender of the republic. It will never do
</p>
<p>to say, as has been said in this argument, that the soldier is not lia
</p>
<p>ble to be tried in time of war by a military tribunal for any other
</p>
<p>offence than those prescribed in the rules and articles of war. To
</p>
<p>my mind, nothing can be clearer than that citizen and soldier alike,
</p>
<p>in time of civil or foreign war, after a proclamation of martial law,
</p>
<p>are triable by military tribunals for all offences of which they may be
</p>
<p>guilty, in the interests of, or in concert with, the enemy.
</p>
<p>These provisions, therefore, of your Constitution for indictment and
</p>
<p>trial by jury in civil courts of all crimes are, as I shall hereafter show,
</p>
<p>silent and inoperative in time of war when the public safety requires it.

</p>
<p>The argument to which I have thus beeii replying, as the court
</p>
<p>will not fail to perceive, nor that public to which the argument is ad
</p>
<p>dressed, is a kbored attempt to establish the proposition, that, by the
</p>
<p>Constitution of the United States-, the American people cannot, even
</p>
<p>in a civil war the greatest the world has ever seen, employ martial
</p>
<p>law and military tribunals as a means of successfully asserting their
</p>
<p>. 27
</p>
<p>authority, preserving their nationality, and securing protection to
</p>
<p>the lives and property of all, and especially to the persons of those to
</p>
<p>whom they have committed, officially, the great, trust of maintaining
</p>
<p>the national authority. The gentleman says, with an air of perfect
</p>
<p>confidence, that he denies the jurisdiction of military tribunals for
</p>
<p>the trial of civilians in time of war, because neither the. Constitution
</p>
<p>nor laws justify, but on the contrary repudiate them, and that all the
</p>
<p>experience of the past is against it. I might content myself with
</p>
<p>saying that the practice of all nations is against the gentleman's con
</p>
<p>clusion. The struggle for our national independence was aided and
</p>
<p>prosecuted by military tribunals and martial law, as well as by arms.
</p>
<p>The cOntest for -American nationality began with the establishment,
</p>
<p>very soon after the firing of the first gun at Lexington on the 19th
</p>
<p>daj' of April, 1775, of military tribunals and martial law. Oh the
</p>
<p>30th of June, 1775, the Continental Congress provided that "whoso
</p>
<p>ever, belonging to tfie continental army, shall be convicted of holding
</p>
<p>correspondence with, or giving intelligence to the enemy, either in
</p>
<p>directly, or directly, shall suffer such punishment as by a court-martial
</p>
<p>shall be ordered.!' This was found not sufficient, inasmuch as it did
</p>
<p>not reach those civilians who, like certain civilians of our day, claim
</p>
<p>the protection of the civil law in time of war against military arrests
</p>
<p>and military trials for military crimes. Therefore, the same Con
</p>
<p>gress, on. the 7th of November, 1775, amended this provision by
</p>
<p>striking out the words "belonging to the continental , army, " and
</p>
<p>adopting the article as follows:
</p>
<p>"All perilous convicted of holding a treacherous correspondence with, or giving
</p>
<p>intelligence to the enemy, shall suffer death or such other punishment as a gen
</p>
<p>eral court-martial shall think proper." .
</p>
<p>And on the 17th of June, 1776, the Congress added an additional
</p>
<p>rule 
</p>
<p>" That all persons, not members of, nor owing allegiance to, any of the United
</p>
<p>States of America, who should be found lurking as spies in or about the fortifi
</p>
<p>cations or encampments of the armies of the United States, or any of them, shall
</p>
<p>suffer death, according to, the law and usage of nations, by the sentence of a
</p>
<p>court-martial, or such other punishment as a court-martial shall direct."

</p>
<p>Comprehensive as was this legislation, embracing as it did
</p>
<p>soldiers, citizens, and aliens, subjecting all alike to trial for their mili
</p>
<p>tary crimes by the military tribunals of justice, according to the law
</p>
<p>and the usage of nations, it was found to be insufficient to meet that
</p>
<p>most dangerous of all crimes committed in the interests of the enemy
</p>
<p>28
</p>
<p>by citizens in time of war  the crime of conspiring together to assas
</p>
<p>sinate or seize and carry away the soldiers and citizens who were
</p>
<p>loyal to the cause of the country. Therefore, on the 27th of Febru
</p>
<p>ary, 1778, the Congress adopted the following resolution:
</p>
<p>" Resolved, That whatever inhabitant of these States shall kill, or seize, or take
</p>
<p>any loyal citizen or citizens thereof and convey him, her, or them to any place
</p>
<p>within the power of the enemy, or shall enter into any combination for such
</p>
<p>purpose, or attempt to carry the same into execution, or hath assisted or shall
</p>
<p>assist therein ; or shall, by giving intelligence, acting as a guide, or in any
</p>
<p>manner whatever, aid the enemy in the perpetration thereof, he shall suffer
</p>
<p>death by the judgment of a court-martial as a traitor, assassin, or spy, if the
</p>
<p>offence be committed within seventy miles of the headquarters of the grand or
</p>
<p>other armies of these States where a general officer commands."  Journals of
</p>
<p>Congress, vol. ii, pp. 459, 460.
</p>
<p>So stood the law until the adoption of the Constitution of the
</p>
<p>United States. Every well-informed man knows that at the time of
</p>
<p>the passage of these acts, the courts, of justice having cognizance of
</p>
<p>all crimes against persons, were open in many of the States, and that
</p>
<p>by their several constitutions and charters, which were then the
</p>
<p>supreme law for the punishment of crimes committed within their
</p>
<p>respective territorial limits, no man was liable to conviction but by
</p>
<p>the verdict of a jury. Take, for example, the provisions of the con
</p>
<p>stitution of North Carolina, adopted on the 10th of November, 1776, .
</p>
<p>and in full force at the time of the passage of the last resolution by
</p>
<p>Congress above cited, which provisions are as follows:
</p>
<p>" That no freeman shall be put to answer any criminal charge but by indict
</p>
<p>ment, presentment, or impeachment."
</p>
<p>" That no freeman shall be convicted of any crime but by the unanimous
</p>
<p>verdict of a jury of good and lawful men in open court, as heretofore used."
</p>
<p>This was the law in 1778 in all the States, and the provision for a
</p>
<p>trial by jury every one knows meant a jury of twelve men, impan
</p>
<p>elled and qualified to try the issue in a civil court. The conclusion
</p>
<p>is not to be avoided, that these enactments of the Congress under the
</p>
<p>Confederation set aside the trial by jury within the several States, and
</p>
<p>expressly provided for the trial by court-martial of "any of the in

<p>habitants" who, during the revolution, might, contrary to the pro
</p>
<p>visions of said law, and in aid of the public enemy, o-iVe them
</p>
<p>intelligence, or kill any loyal citizens of the United States, or enter
</p>
<p>into any combination to kill or carry them away. How comes it, if
</p>
<p>the argument of the counsel be true, that this enactment was
</p>
<p>passed by the Congress of 1778, when the constitutions of the several
</p>
<p>29 
</p>
<p>States at that day as fully guaranteed trial by jury to every person
</p>
<p>held to answer for a crime, as does the Constitution of the United
</p>
<p>States at this hour? Notwithstanding this fact, I have yet to learn
</p>
<p>that any loyal man ever challenged, during all the period of our con
</p>
<p>flict for independence and nationality, the validity of that law for the
</p>
<p>trial', for military offences, by military tribunals, of all offenders, as the
</p>
<p>law, not of peace, but of war, and absolutely essential to the prosecu
</p>
<p>tion of war. I may be pardoned for saying that it is the accepted
</p>
<p>common law of nations, that martial-law is, at all times and every
</p>
<p>where, essential to the successful prosecution of war, whether it be a
</p>
<p>civil or a foreign war. The validity Of these acts of the Continental
</p>
<p>and Confederate Congress I know was challenged, but only by men
</p>
<p>charged with the guilt of their country' s blood.
</p>
<p>Washington, the peerless, the stainless, and the just, with whom God
</p>
<p>walked through the night of that great trial, enforced this just and
</p>
<p>wise enactment upon all occasions. On the 30th of September, 1780,
</p>
<p>Joshua H, Smith, by the order of General Washington, was put upon
</p>
<p>his trial before a court-martial, convened in the State of New York,
</p>
<p>on the charge of there aiding and assisting Benedict Arnold, in a
</p>
<p>combination with the enemy, to take, kill, and seize such loyal citizens
</p>
<p>or soldiers of the United States as were in garrison at West Point.
</p>
<p>Smith objected to the jurisdiction, averring that he was a private citi
</p>
<p>zen, not in the military or naval service, and therefore was only amen
</p>
<p>able to the civil authority of the State,, whose constitution had guaran
</p>
<p>teed the right of trial by jury to all persons held to answer for crime.
</p>
<p>(Chandler's Criminal Trials, vol. 2, p. 187,) The constitution of New
</p>
<p>York then in force had so provided; but, notwithstanding that, the
</p>
<p>court overruled the plea, held him to answer, and tried him. I re
</p>
<p>peat, that when Smith was thus tried by court-martial, the constitu
</p>
<p>tion of New York as fully guaranteed trial by jury in the civil courts
</p>
<p>to all civilians charged and held to answer for crimes within the limits
</p>
<p>of that State, as does the Constitution of the United States guarantee
</p>
<p>such trial within the limits of the District of Columbia. By the
</p>
<p>second of the Articles of Confederation each State retained "its
</p>
<p>sovereignty," and every power; jurisdiction, and right not expressly

</p>
<p>delegated to the United States in Congress assembled. By those
</p>
<p>articles there was no express delegation of judicial power; therefore
</p>
<p>the States retained it fully.
</p>
<p>If the military courts, constituted by the commander of the army of
</p>
<p>the United States under the Confederation, who was appointed only by
</p>
<p>a resolution of the Congress, without any express grant of power to
</p>
<p>30
</p>
<p>authorize it  his office not being created by the act of the people in
</p>
<p>their fundamental law had jurisdiction in every State to try and put
</p>
<p>to death "any inhabitant" thereof who should kill any loyal citizen
</p>
<p>or enter into " any combination" for any such purpose therein in
</p>
<p>time of war, notwithstanding the provisions of the constitution and
</p>
<p>laws of such States, how can any man conceive that under the Con
</p>
<p>stitution of the United States, which is the supreme law over every
</p>
<p>State, anything in the constitution and laws of such State to the con
</p>
<p>trary notwithstanding, and the supreme law over every Territory of the
</p>
<p>republic as well, the Commander-in-Chief of the army of the United
</p>
<p>States, who is made such by the Constitution, and by its supreme au
</p>
<p>thority clothed with the power and charged with the duty of direct
</p>
<p>ing and controlling the whole military power of the United States in
</p>
<p>time of rebellion or invasion, has not that authority?
</p>
<p>I need not remind the oourt that one of the marked differences be
</p>
<p>tween the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution of the United
</p>
<p>States was, that, under the Confederation, the Congress was the sole
</p>
<p>depository of all federal power. The Congress of the Confederation,
</p>
<p>said Madison, held "the command of the army." (Fed., No. 38.) Has
</p>
<p>the Constitution-, which was ordained by the people the better "to
</p>
<p>insure domestic tranquillity and to provide for the common defence, "'so
</p>
<p>fettered the great power Of self-defence against armed insurrection
</p>
<p>or invasion that martial law, so essential in war, is forbidden by
</p>
<p>that great instrument? I will yield to no man in reverence for or
</p>
<p>obedience to the Constitution of my country, esteeming it, as I do, a
</p>
<p>new evangel to the nations, embodying the democracy of the New
</p>
<p>Testament  the absolute equality of all men before the law, in respect
</p>
<p>of those rights of human nature which are the gift of God, and there
</p>
<p>fore as universal as the material structure of man. Can it be that
</p>
<p>this Constitution of ours, so divine in its spirit of justice, so benefi-1
</p>
<p>cent in its results, so full of wisdom and goodness and truth under
</p>
<p>which we became one people* a great and powerful nationality, has,
</p>
<p>in terms or by implication, denied to this people the power to crush
</p>
<p>armed rebellion by war, and to arrest and punish, during the exist

<p>of nations, secret conspirators, who aid and abet the public enemy?
</p>
<p>Here is a conspiracy, organized and prosecuted by armed traitors
</p>
<p>and hired assassins, receiving the moral support of thousands
</p>
<p>in every State and district, who pronounced the war for the
</p>
<p>Union a failure, and your now murdered but immortal Commander-in-
</p>
<p>Chief a tyrant; the object of which conspiracy, as the testimony
</p>
<p>31
</p>
<p>shows, was to aid. the tottering rebellion which struck at the nation's
</p>
<p>life. It is in evidence that Davis, Thompson, and others, chiefs in
</p>
<p>this rebellion, in aid of the same, agreed and conspired with others to
</p>
<p>poison the fountains of water which supply your commercial metrop
</p>
<p>olis, and thereby murder its inhabitants; to secretly deposit in the
</p>
<p>habitations of the people and in the ships in your harbors inflammable
</p>
<p>materials, and thereby destroy them by fire;, to murder by the slow
</p>
<p>and consuming torture of famine your soldiers, captive in their hands;
</p>
<p>to import pestilence in infected clothes to be distributed in your cap
</p>
<p>ital and camps, and thereby murder the surviving heroes and defend
</p>
<p>ers of the republic, who, standing by the holy graves of your unre-
</p>
<p>turning brave, proudly and defiantly challenge to honorable combat
</p>
<p>and open battle all- public enemies, that their country may live; and,
</p>
<p>finally, to crown this horrid catalogue of crime, this sum of all human
</p>
<p>atrocities, conspired, as charged upon your record, with the accused
</p>
<p>and John Wilkes Booth and John H. Surratt, to kill and murder in
</p>
<p>your capital the executive officers of your government and the com
</p>
<p>mander of your armies. When this conspiracy, entered into by these
</p>
<p>traitors, is revealed by its attempted execution, and the foul and
</p>
<p>brutal murder of your President in the capital, you are told that it is
</p>
<p>unconstitutional, in order to arrest the further execution of the con
</p>
<p>spiracy, to interpose the military power of this government for the
</p>
<p>arrest, without civil process, of any of the parties, thereto, and for
</p>
<p>their trial by a military tribunal of justice. If any such rule had
</p>
<p>obtained during our struggle for independence, we never would have
</p>
<p>been a nation. If any such rule had been adopted and acted upon
</p>
<p>now, during the fierce struggle of ' the past four years, no man can
</p>
<p>say that our nationality would have thus long survived.
</p>
<p>The whole people of the. United States by their Constitution have
</p>
<p>created the office of President of the United States and commander-
</p>
<p>in-chief of the army and navy, and have vested, by the terms of that
</p>
<p>Constitution, in the person of the President and commander-in-chief,
</p>
<p>the power to enforce the execution of the laws, and preserve, protect,
</p>
<p>and defend the Constitution.

<p>The question may well be asked : If? as commander-in-chief, the

<p>President may not, in time of insurrection or war, proclaim and ex
</p>
<p>ecute martial law, according to the usages of nations, how he can
</p>
<p>successfully perform the duties of his office  execute the laws, pre
</p>
<p>serve the Constitution, suppress insurrection, and repel invasion ?
</p>
<p>Martial law and military tribunals are as essential to the successful

</p>
<p>raise armies and navies exclusively in the Congress, and the power
</p>
<p>to prosecute the war and Command the army and navy exclusively in
</p>
<p>the President of the United States. As, under the Confederation,
</p>
<p>the commander of the army, appointed only by the Congress, was

<p>by the resolution of that Congress empowered, to act as he might think

<p>proper for'the good and welfare of the service, subject only to such

<p>protect, and defend the Constitution and execute the laws, as enjoined
</p>
<p>by his oath and the very letter of the Constitution, subject to no
</p>
<p>restriction or direction save such as Congress may from time to time
</p>
<p>prescribe. That these powers for the common defence, intrusted by the Con
</p>
<p>stitution exclusively to the Congress and the President, are, in time of
</p>
<p>civil war or foreign invasion, to be exercised without limitation or
</p>
<p>restraint, to the extent of the public necessity, and without any in
</p>
<p>tervention of the federal judiciary or of State constitutions or State
</p>
<p>laws, are facts in our history not open to question.
</p>
<p>The position is not to be answered by saying you make the Ameri
</p>
<p>can Congress thereby omnipotent, and clothe the American Execu
</p>
<p>tive with the asserted attribute of hereditary monarchy  the king
</p>
<p>can do no wrong. Let the position be fairly stated  that the Con
</p>
<p>gress and President, in war as in peace, are but the agents of the
</p>
<p>whole people, and that this unlimited power for the common defence
</p>
<p>against armed rebellion or foreign invasion is but the power of the
</p>
<p>people intrusted exclusively to the legislative and executive depart
</p>
<p>ments as their agents, for any and every abuse of which these agents
</p>
<p>are directly responsible to' the people  and the demagogue cry of an
</p>
<p>omnipotent Congress, and an Executive invested with royal preroga
</p>
<p>tives, vanishes like the baseless fabric of a vision. If the Congress,
</p>
<p>corruptly, or oppressively, or wantonly abuse this great trust, the
</p>
<p>people by the irresistible power of the ballot hurl them from place.

<p>If the President so abuse the trust, the people by their Congress
</p>
<p>withhold supplies, or by impeachment transfer the trust to better

</p>
<p>I can understand very well why men should tremble at the exercise
</p>
<p>of this great power by a monarch whose person, by the constitution
</p>
<p>of his realm, is inviolable, but I cannot conceive how any American
</p>
<p>citizen, who has faith in the capacity of the whole people to govern
</p>
<p>themselves, should give himself any concern on the subject. Mr.
</p>
<p>Hallam, ,the distinguished author of the Constitutional. History of
</p>
<p>England, has said :
</p>
<p>"Kings love to display the divinity with which their flatterers -invest them
</p>
<p>in nothing so much as in the instantaneous execution of their will, and to stand
</p>
<p>revealed, as it were, in the storm and thunderbolt when their power breaks
</p>
<p>through the operation of secondai-y causes and awes .a prostrate nation without
</p>
<p>the intervention qf law."
</p>
<p>How just ate such words when applied to an irresponsible monarch 1
</p>
<p>how absurd, when applied to a whole people, acting through their
</p>
<p>duly appointed agents, whose will, thus declared, is the supreme law,
</p>
<p>to awe into submission and peace and obedience, not a prostrate
</p>
<p>nation, but a prostrate rebellion ! The same, great author utters the
</p>
<p>fact which all history attests, when he says :
</p>
<p>" It has been usual for all governments during actual rebellion to proclaim
</p>
<p>martial law for the suspensiop of civil jurisdiction ; and this anomaly, I must
</p>
<p>admit," he adds, " is very far from being less indispensable at such unhappy
</p>
<p>seasons where the ordinary mode of trial is by jury, than where the right of
</p>
<p>decision resides in the court," Const. Hist., vol. i, ch. 5, p. 326.
</p>
<p>That the power to proclaim, martial law and fully or, partially sus
</p>
<p>pend the, civil jurisdiction, federal and state, in time of rebellion or
</p>
<p>civil war, and punish by military tribunals all offences committed in
</p>
<p>aid of the public enemy, is conferred upon Congress and the Execu
</p>
<p>tive, necessarily results from the unlimited grants of power for the
</p>
<p>common defence to which I have already briefly referred. I may
</p>
<p>be pardoned for saying that this position is not assumed by me for
</p>
<p>the purposes of this occasion, but that early in the first year of this
</p>
<p>great struggle for our national life I proclaimed it as a representa,-
</p>
<p>tive of the people, under the obligation of my oath, and, as I then
</p>
<p>believed, and still believe, upon the authority of the great men who
</p>
<p>formed and fashioned the wise and majestic fabric of American gov

<p>ernment. Some of the citations which I deemed it my duty at that time to
</p>
<p>make, and some of which I now reproduce, have, I am pleased to
</p>
<p>say, found a wider circulation in books that have since been pub
</p>
<p>lished by others.
</p>
<p>When the Constitution was on trial for its deliverance before the
</p>
<p>3B
</p>
<p>34
</p>
<p>people of the several States, its ratification was opposed on the
</p>
<p>ground that it conferred upon Congress and the Executive, unlimited
</p>
<p>power for the common defence. To all such objectors and they were
</p>
<p>numerous in every State  that great man, Alexander Hamilton, whose
</p>
<p>words will live as long as our language lives, speaking to the listening
</p>
<p>people of all the States and urging them not to reject that matchless
</p>
<p>instrument which bore the name of Washington, said :
</p>
<p>"The authorities 'essential 'to the care of the common defence are these: To
</p>
<p>raise armies ; to build and equip fleets; to prescribe rules for the government
</p>
<p>of both ; to direct their operations ; to provide for their support. These pow
</p>
<p>ers ought to exist without limitation ; because it is impossible to foresee or
</p>
<p>define the extent and variety of national exigencies, and the correspondent ex
</p>
<p>tent and variety of the means which may be necessary to satisfy them.
</p>
<p>"The circumstances that endanger the safety of nations are infinite; and
</p>
<p>for this reason no constitutional shackles can wisely be imposed on the power
</p>
<p>to which the care :of it is committed. * * * This power ought
</p>
<p>to be under the direction of the same councils which are appointed to preside
</p>
<p>over the common defence. * * * It must be admitted, as a ne
</p>
<p>cessary consequence, that there can be no limitation of that authority which is
</p>
<p>to provide for the defence and protection of the community, in any manner es
</p>
<p>sential to its efficacy; that is, in any matter essential to the formation, direction,
</p>
<p>or support of the national forces."
</p>
<p>He adds the further remark : " This is one of those truths which, to a cor
</p>
<p>rect and unprejudiced mind, carries its own evidence along with it; and may
</p>
<p>be obscured, but cannot be made plainer by argument or reasoning. It rests
</p>
<p>upon axioms as simple as they are universal  the means ought to be propor
</p>
<p>tioned to the end ; the persons from whose agency the attainment of any end is
</p>
<p>expected ought to possess the means by which it is to be attained."  Federal
</p>
<p>ist, No. 23.
</p>
<p>In the same great contest for the adoption of the Constitution
</p>
<p>Madison, sometimes called the Father of the Constitution, said:
</p>
<p>" Is the power of declaring war necessary? No man will answer this ques
</p>
<p>tion in the negative. * * * Is the power of raising armies and
</p>
<p>equipping fleets necessary 1 * * * It is involved in the power
</p>
<p>of self-defence. * * * With what color of propriety could

<p>the force necessary for defence be limited by those who cannot limit the force of
</p>
<p>offence 1 * * * The means of security can only be regu
</p>
<p>lated by the means and the . danger of attack. * * * It is in
</p>
<p>vain to oppose constitutional barriers to the impulse of self-preservation. It is
</p>
<p>worse than in vain, because it plants in the Constitution itself necessary usur
</p>
<p>pations of power."  Federalist, No. 41.
</p>
<p>With this construction, proclaimed both by the advocates and oppo-
</p>
<p>35
</p>
<p>nents of its ratification, the Constitution of the United States was ac
</p>
<p>cepted and adopted, and that construction has been followed and
</p>
<p>acted upon,, by every department of the government to this day.
</p>
<p>It was as well understood then in theory as it has since been
</p>
<p>illustrated in practice, that the judicial power, both federal and
</p>
<p>State,, had no voice and could exercise no authority in the conduct
</p>
<p>and prosecution of a war, except, in subordination to the political de
</p>
<p>partment of the government. The Constitution contains the signifi
</p>
<p>cant provision, "The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not
</p>
<p>be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public
</p>
<p>safety may require it."
</p>
<p>What was this but a declaration, that in time of rebellion, or in
</p>
<p>vasion, the public safety is the highest law?  that so far as necessary
</p>
<p>the civil courts (of which the Commander-in-Chief, under the direction
</p>
<p>of Congress, shall be the sole judge) must be silent, and the rights
</p>
<p>of each citizen, as secured in time of peace, must yield to the wants,
</p>
<p>interests, and necessities of the nation? Yet we have been gravely
</p>
<p>told by the gentleman, in his argument, that the maxim, salus populi
</p>
<p>swpremaest lex, is but fit for a tyrant's use. Those grand men, whom
</p>
<p>God taught to build the fabric of empire, thought otherwise,
</p>
<p>when they put that maxim into the Constitution of their country. It
</p>
<p>is very clear that the Constitution recognizes the great principle
</p>
<p>which underlies the structure of society and of all civil government ;
</p>
<p>thatno man lives forhimself alone, but each for all; that, if need be, some
</p>
<p>must die, that the State may live, because at best the individual is but
</p>
<p>for to-day, while the commonwealth is for all time. I agree with the
</p>
<p>gentleman in the maxim which he borrows from Aristotle, "Let the
</p>
<p>public weal be under the protection of the law ;" but I claim that in
</p>
<p>war; as in peace, by the very terms of the Constitution of the coun
</p>
<p>try, the public safety is under the protection of the law; that the
</p>
<p>Constitution itself has provided for the declaration of war for the com
</p>
<p>mon defence, to suppress rebellion, to repel invasion, and, by express
</p>
<p>terms, has declared that whatever is necessary to make the prosecu
</p>
<p>tion of the war successful, may be done, and ought to be done, and
</p>
<p>is therefore constitutionally lawful.

</p>
<p>Who will dare to say that in time of civil war "no person shall be
</p>
<p>deprived of life, liberty, and property, without due process of law?"
</p>
<p>This is a provision of your Constitution than which there is none
</p>
<p>more just or sacred in it; it is, however, only the law of peace, not
</p>
<p>of war. In peace, that wise provision of the Constitution must be,
</p>
<p>and is, enforced by the civil courts ; in war, it must be, and is, to a
</p>
<p>36
</p>
<p>great extent, inoperative and disregarded. The thousands slain by
</p>
<p>your afmies in battle were deprived of life ' ' without due process of
</p>
<p>law." All spies arrested, convicted, and executed by your military
</p>
<p>tribunals in time of war are deprived of liberty and- life "without
</p>
<p>due process of law ;" all enemies captured and held as prisoners of
</p>
<p>war are deprived of liberty ' ' without due process of law ;" all owners
</p>
<p>whose property is forcibly seized and appropriated in war are de
</p>
<p>prived of their property " without due process of law." The Con
</p>
<p>stitution recognizes the principle of common law, that every man's
</p>
<p>house is his castle; that his home, the shelter of his wife and children,-
</p>
<p>is his most sacred possession ; and has therefore specially provided,
</p>
<p>"thatno soldier shall in time of peace be quartered in any house,
</p>
<p>without the consent of its owner, noi* in time of war, but in a manner
</p>
<p>to be prescribed by law, [III Amend. ;] thereby declaring that, in time
</p>
<p>of war, Congress may by law authorize, as it has done, that without
</p>
<p>the consent and against the consent of the owner, the soldier may be
</p>
<p>quartered in any man's house, and upon any man's hearth. What I
</p>
<p>have said illustrates the proppsition, that in time of war the' civil tribu
</p>
<p>nals of justice are wholly or partially silent, as the public safety may re
</p>
<p>quire; thatthe limitations and provisions. of the Constitution in favor
</p>
<p>of life, liberty and property are therefore wholly or partially sus
</p>
<p>pended. In this I am sustained by an authority second to none with
</p>
<p>intelligent American citizens. Mr. John Quincy Adams, than whom
</p>
<p>a purer man or a wiser statesman never ascended the chair of the
</p>
<p>chief magistracy in America, said in his place in the House of Rep
</p>
<p>resentatives, in 1836, that:
</p>
<p>" In the authority given to Congress by the Constitution of the United States
</p>
<p>to declare war, all the powers incident to war are by necessary implication con
</p>
<p>ferred upon the government of the United States. Now the. powers incidental
</p>
<p>to war are derived, not from their internal municipal source, hut from the laws
</p>
<p>and usages of nations. There are, then, in the authority of Congress aud of the
</p>
<p>Executive two classes of powers altogether different in their nature and often
</p>
<p>incompatible with each other, the war power and the peace power. The peace
</p>
<p>power is limited by regulations and restricted by provisions prescribed within
</p>
<p>the Constitution itself. The war power is limited only by the laws and usage

</p>
<p>of nations. This power is tremendous; it is strictly constitutional, but it
</p>
<p>breaks down every barrier- so anxiously erected for the protection of liberty, of !
</p>
<p>property, and of life."
</p>
<p>If this be so, how can there be trial by jury for military offences
</p>
<p>in time of civil war? If you cannot, and do not, try the armed
</p>
<p>enemy before you shoot him, or the captured enemy before you im-
</p>
<p>37
</p>
<p>prison him, why should you be held to open the civil courts and try
</p>
<p>the spy, the conspirator, and the -assassin, in the secret service of
</p>
<p>the public enemy, by jury, before you convict and punish him ?
</p>
<p>Why not clamor against holding imprisoned the captured armed
</p>
<p>rebels, deprived of their liberty without due process of law? Are
</p>
<p>they not citizens ? Why not clamor against slaying for their crime
</p>
<p>of treason, which is cognizable in the civil courts,. by your rifled
</p>
<p>ordnance and the leaden hail of your musketry in battle, these public
</p>
<p>enemies, without trial by jury? Are they not citizens ? Why is the
</p>
<p>clamor confined exclusively to the trial by military tribunals of jus
</p>
<p>tice of traitorous spies, traitorous conspirators, and assassins hired to
</p>
<p>do secretly what the armed rebel attempts to do openly  murder
</p>
<p>your nationality by assassinating its defenders and its executive offi
</p>
<p>cers ? Nothing can be clearer than that the rebel captured prisoner,
</p>
<p>being a citizen of the republic, is as much entitled to trial by jury
</p>
<p>before he is committed to prison, as- the spy, or the aider and abettor
</p>
<p>of the treason by conspiracy and assassination, being a citizen, is
</p>
<p>entitled to such trial by jury, before he is subjected to the just
</p>
<p>punishment of the law for his great crime. I think that in time of
</p>
<p>war the remark of Montesquieu, touching the^ civil judiciary, is true :
</p>
<p>that "it is next to nothing." Hamilton well said, " The Executive
</p>
<p>holds the sword of the, community ; the judiciary has no direction of
</p>
<p>the strength of society ; it has neither force nor will ; it has judg
</p>
<p>ment alone, and. is dependent forthe execution of that upon the arm
</p>
<p>of the Executive." The people of these States so understood the
</p>
<p>Constitution, and adopted it, and intended thereby, without limita
</p>
<p>tion or restraint, to empower their Congress and Executive to author
</p>
<p>ize by law, and execute by force, whatever the public safety might
</p>
<p>require, to suppress rebellion or repel invasion.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all that has been said by the counsel for the ac
</p>
<p>cused to the contrary, the Constitution has received this construction
</p>
<p>from the day of its adoption to this hour. The Supreme Court of
</p>
<p>the United States has solemnly decided that the Constitution has con
</p>
<p>ferred upon the government authority to employ all the means neces
</p>
<p>sary to the faithful execution of all the powers which that Constitu

</p>
<p>tion enjoins upon the government of the United States, and upon
</p>
<p>every department and every officer thereof. Speaking of that pro
</p>
<p>vision of the Constitution which provides that " Congress shall have
</p>
<p>power to make all laws that may be necessary and proper to carry
</p>
<p>into effect all powers granted to the government of the United States,
</p>
<p>or to any department or officer thereof," Chief Justice Marshall, in
</p>
<p>38
</p>
<p>his great decision in the case of McCulloch vs. State of Maryland,
</p>
<p>says: " The powers given to the government imply the ordinary means of execu
</p>
<p>tion, and the government, in all sound, reason and fair interpretation, must have
</p>
<p>the choice of the means which it deems the most "convenient and appropriate to
</p>
<p>the execution of- the power. * * * The powers of the government
</p>
<p>were given for the welfare of the nation ; they were intended to endure for ages
</p>
<p>to come, and to he adapted to the various crises in human affairs. To prescribe
</p>
<p>the specific means by which government should, in all future time, execute its
</p>
<p>power, and to confine the choice of means to such narrow limits as should not
</p>
<p>leave it in the power of Congress to adopt any which might be appropriate and
</p>
<p>conducive to the end, would be most unwise and pernicious."  (4 Wheaton, 420.)
</p>
<p>Words fitly spoken 1 which illustrated at the time of their utterance
</p>
<p>the wisdom of the Constitution in providing this general grant of
</p>
<p>power to meet every possible exigency which the fortunes of war
</p>
<p>might cast upon the country, and the wisdom of which words, in
</p>
<p>turn, has been illustrated to-day by the gigantic and triumphant
</p>
<p>struggle of the people during the last four years for the supremacy
</p>
<p>of the Constitution, and in exact accordance with its provisions. In
</p>
<p>the light of these wonderful events, the words of Pinckney, uttered
</p>
<p>when the illustrious Chief Justice had concluded this opinion, "The
</p>
<p>Constitution of mycountryis immortal!" seem to have become words of
</p>
<p>prophecy. Has not this great tribunal, through the chief of all
</p>
<p>its judges, by this luminous and profound reasoning, declared that
</p>
<p>the government may by law authorize the Executive to emplov, in
</p>
<p>the prosecution of war, the ordinary means, and all the means neces
</p>
<p>sary and adapted to the end? And in the other decision, before re
</p>
<p>ferred to, in the 8th of Cranch, arising during the late war with
</p>
<p>Great Britain, Mr. Justice Story said :
</p>
<p>" When the legislative authority, to whom the right to declare war is con
</p>
<p>fided, has declared war in its most unlimited manner, the executive authority,
</p>
<p>to whom the execution of the war is confided, is bound to carry it into effect.
</p>
<p>He has a discretion vested in him as to the manner and extent, but he cannot
</p>
<p>lawfully transcend the rules of warfare established among civilized nations.
</p>
<p>He cannot lawfully exercise powers or authorize proceedings which the civil
</p>
<p>ized world repudiates and disclaims. The sovereignty, as to declai'ino- war and

</p>
<p>limiting its effects, rests with the legislature. The sovereignty as to its execu
</p>
<p>tion rests with the President."  (Brown vs. United States, 8 Cranch, 153.)
</p>
<p>Has the Congress, to whom is committed the sovereignty of the
</p>
<p>whole people to declare war, by legislation restricted the President
</p>
<p>39
</p>
<p>or attempted to restrict him, in the prosecution of this war for the
</p>
<p>Union, from exercising all the "powers" and adopting all the "pro
</p>
<p>ceedings" usually approved and employed by the civilized world?
</p>
<p>He would, in my judgment, be a bold man who asserted that Con
</p>
<p>gress has so legislated ; and the Congress which should by law fetter
</p>
<p>the executive arm when raised for the common defence would, in
</p>
<p>my opinion, be false to their oath. That Congress may prescribe
</p>
<p>rules for the government of the army and navy and the militia when
</p>
<p>in actual service, by articles of war, is an express grant of power in
</p>
<p>the Constitution, which Congress has rightfully exercised, and which
</p>
<p>the Executive must and does obey. That Congress may aid the
</p>
<p>Executive by legislation in the prosecution of a war, civil or foreign,
</p>
<p>is admitted. That Congress may restrain the Executive, and arraign,
</p>
<p>try, and 'condemn him, for wantonly abusing the great trust, is ex
</p>
<p>pressly declared in the Constitution. That Congress shall pass all
</p>
<p>laws necessary to enable the Executive to execute the laws of the
</p>
<p>Union, suppress insurrection, and repel invasion, is one of the express
</p>
<p>requirements of the Constitution, for the performance of which the
</p>
<p>Congress is bound by an oath.
</p>
<p>What was the legislation Of Congress when treason fired its first
</p>
<p>gun on Sumter? By the act of 1795 it is provided that whenever
</p>
<p>the laws of the United States shall be opposed, or the execution
</p>
<p>thereof obstructed, in any State, by combinations too powerful to be
</p>
<p>suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceeding or by the
</p>
<p>powers vested in the marshals, it shall be lawful by this act for the
</p>
<p>President to call forth the militia of such State", or of any other State or
</p>
<p>States, as may be necessary to suppress such combinations and to cause
</p>
<p>the laws to be executed. (1st Statutes at Large, 424.) By the act of
</p>
<p>18,07 it is provided that in case of insurrection or obstruction to the
</p>
<p>laws, either of the United States or of any individual State or Terri
</p>
<p>tory, where itis lawful for the President of theUnited States to call forth
</p>
<p>the militia for the purpose of suppressing such insurrection or of caus
</p>
<p>ing the laws to be duly executed, it shall be lawful for him to employ
</p>
<p>for such purpose such part of the land or naval forces of the United
</p>
<p>States as shall be judged necessary. (2d Statutes at Large, 443.)

<p>Can anyone doubt that by these acts the President is clothed with
</p>
<p>full power to determine whether armed insurrection exists in any
</p>
<p>State or Territory of the Union ; and if so, to make war upon it with
</p>
<p>all the force he may deem necessary or be able to command ? By the
</p>
<p>simple exercise of this great power it necessarily results that he may,
</p>
<p>in the prosecution of the war for the suppression of such insurrec-
</p>
<p>40
</p>
<p>tion, suspend as far as may be necessary the civil administration of
</p>
<p>justice by substituting in its stead martial law, which is simply the
</p>
<p>common law of war. If in such a moment the President may make
</p>
<p>no arrests without civil warrant, and may inflict no violence or pen
</p>
<p>alties on persons (as is claimed here for the accused,) without first
</p>
<p>obtaining the verdict of juries and the judgment of civil courts, then
</p>
<p>is this legislation a mockery, and the Constitution, which not only
</p>
<p>authorized but enjoined its enactment, but a glittering generality
</p>
<p>and a splendid bauble. Happily.the Supreme Court has settled all
</p>
<p>controversy on this question. In speaking of the Rhode Island insur
</p>
<p>rection, the court say:
</p>
<p>" The Constitution of the United States, as far as it has provided for an
</p>
<p>emergency of this kind and authorized the general government to interfere in
</p>
<p>the domestic concerns of a State, has treated the subject as political in its na
</p>
<p>ture and placed the power in the hands of that department."
</p>
<p>" By the act of 1795 the power of .deciding whether the exigency has arisen
</p>
<p>upon which the government of the United States is bound to interfere is given
</p>
<p>to the President."
</p>
<p>The court add :
</p>
<p>" When the President has acted and called: out the militia, is a circuit court
</p>
<p>of the United States authorized to inquire whether his decision was right 1 If
</p>
<p>it could, then it -would become the duty of the court, provided it came to the
</p>
<p>conclusion that the President had decided incorrectly, to discharge those who
</p>
<p>were arrested or detained by the troops in the service of the United States."
</p>
<p>* * * "If the judicial power extends so far, the guarantee con
</p>
<p>tained in the Constitution of the United States is a guarantee of anarchy and
</p>
<p>not of order." * * * " Yet if this right does not reside in the
</p>
<p>courts when the conflict is raging, if the judicial power is at that time bound
</p>
<p>to follow the decision of the political, it must be equally bound when the con
</p>
<p>test is over. It cannot, when peace is restored, punish as offences and crimes
</p>
<p>the acts which it before recognized and was bound to recognize as lawful." 
</p>
<p>Luther vs. Borden, 7 Howard, 42, 43.
</p>
<p>If this be law, what becomes of the volunteer advice of the vol
</p>
<p>unteer counsel, by him given without money and without price, to
</p>
<p>this court, of their responsibility  their personal responsibility, for

<p>obeying the orders of the President of the' United States in trying
</p>
<p>persons accused of the murder of the Chief Magistrate and com
</p>
<p>mander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States in time
</p>
<p>of rebellion, and in pursuance of a conspiracy entered into with the
</p>
<p>public enemy? I may be pardoned for asking the attention of the
</p>
<p>court to a further citation from this important decision, in which the
</p>
<p>court say, the employment of military powor to put down an armed
</p>
<p>41
</p>
<p>insurrection "is essential to the existence of every government, and
</p>
<p>is as necessary to the States of this Union as to any other govern
</p>
<p>ment ; and if the government of the State deem the armed opposition
</p>
<p>so formidable as to require the use of military force and the declara
</p>
<p>tion of martial LAW, we -see no ground upon which this court can
</p>
<p>question its authority." (Ibid.) This decision in terms declared that
</p>
<p>under the act of 1795 the President had power to decide and did
</p>
<p>decide the question so as to exclude further inquiry whether the
</p>
<p>State government which'thus employed force and proclaimed mar
</p>
<p>tial law was the government of the State, and therefore was per
</p>
<p>mitted to act. If a State may do this, to put down armed insurrec
</p>
<p>tion, may not the federal government as well? The reason of the
</p>
<p>man who doubts it may justly be questioned- I but quote the lan^
</p>
<p>guage of that tribunal, in another case before cited, when I say the
</p>
<p>Constitution confers upon the President the whole executive power.
</p>
<p>We have seen that the proclamation of blockade made by the Pres
</p>
<p>ident was affirmed by the Supreme Court as a lawful and valid act,
</p>
<p>although its direct effect was to dispose of the property of whoever
</p>
<p>violated it, whether citizen or stranger. It is difficult to perceive
</p>
<p>what course of reasoning can be adopted, in the light of that decision,
</p>
<p>which will justify any man in saying that the President had not the
</p>
<p>like power to proclaim martial law in time of insurrection against the
</p>
<p>United States, and to establish, according to the customs of war among
</p>
<p>civilized nations, military tribunals of justice for its enforcement, and
</p>
<p>for the punishment of all crimes committed in the interests of the
</p>
<p>public enemy.
</p>
<p>These acts, of the President have, however, all been legalized by
</p>
<p>the subsequent legislation of Congress, although the Supreme Court
</p>
<p>decided, in relation to the proclamation of blockade, that no such
</p>
<p>legislation was necessary. By the act of August 6, 1861, ch. 63,
</p>
<p>sec. 3, it is enacted that 
</p>
<p>"All the acts, proclamations, and orders of the President of the United States,
</p>
<p>after the 4th of March, 1861, respecting the army and navy of the United States,
</p>
<p>and calling out, or relating to, the militia or volunteers from the States, are
</p>
<p>hereby approved in all respects, legalized, and made valid to the same extent

</p>
<p>and with the same effect as if they had been issued- and done under the previous
</p>
<p>express authority and direction of' the Congress of the United States."  (12
</p>
<p>Stat, at Large, 326.)
</p>
<p>This act legalized, if any such legalization was necessary, all that
</p>
<p>the President had done from the day of his inauguration to that hour,
</p>
<p>in the prosecution of the war for the Union. He had suspended the
</p>
<p>42
</p>
<p>privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and resisted its execution when
</p>
<p>issued by the Chief Justice of the United States; he had called out and
</p>
<p>accepted the services of a large body of volunteers for a period not
</p>
<p>previously authorized by law; he had declared a blockade of the
</p>
<p>southern ports; he had declared the southern States in insurrection;
</p>
<p>he had Ordered the armies to invade them and suppress it; thus ex
</p>
<p>ercising, in accordance with the laws of war, power over the life, the
</p>
<p>liberty, and the property of the citizens. Congress ratified it and
</p>
<p>affirmed it.
</p>
<p>In like manner and by subsequent legislation did the Congress rat
</p>
<p>ify and affirm the proclamation of martial law of September 25, 1862.
</p>
<p>That proclamation, as the court will have observed, declares that
</p>
<p>during the existing insurrection all rebels and insurgents, their aiders
</p>
<p>and abettors within the United States, and all persons guilty of any
</p>
<p>disloyal practice affording aid and comfort to the rebels against the
</p>
<p>authority of the United States, shall be subject to, martial law and
</p>
<p>liable to trial and punishment by courts-martial or military commission;
</p>
<p>and second, that the writ of habeas corpus is suspended in respect to
</p>
<p>all persons arrested, or who are now, or hereafter during the rebel
</p>
<p>lion shall be, imprisoned in any fort, <fec, by any military authority,
</p>
<p>or by the sentence of any court-martial or military commission.
</p>
<p>One would suppose that it needed no argument to satisfy an intel
</p>
<p>ligent and patriotic citizen of the United States that, by the ruling
</p>
<p>of the Supreme Court cited, so much of this proclamation as declares
</p>
<p>that all rebels and insurgents, their aiders and abettors, shall be sub
</p>
<p>ject to martial law and be liable to trial and punishment by court-
</p>
<p>martial or military commission, needed no ratification by Congress.
</p>
<p>Every step that the President took against rebels and insurgents was
</p>
<p>taken in pursuance of the rules of war and was an exercise of martial
</p>
<p>law. Who says that he should not deprive them, by the authority of
</p>
<p>this law, of life and liberty ? Are the aiders and abettors of these in
</p>
<p>surgents entitled to any higher consideration than the armed insur
</p>
<p>gents themselves? It is against these that the President proclaimed
</p>
<p>martial law, and against all others who were guilty of any disloyal
</p>
<p>practice affording aid and comfort to rebels against the authority of

</p>
<p>the United States. Against these he suspended the privilege of the
</p>
<p>writ of habeas corpus; and these, and only such as these, were by
</p>
<p>that proclamation subjected to trial and punishment by court-martial
</p>
<p>or military commission.
</p>
<p>That the Proclamation covers the offence charged here, no man will,
</p>
<p>or dare, for a moment deny. Was it not a disloyal practice ? Was
</p>
<p>43
</p>
<p>it not aiding and abetting the insurgents and rebels to enter into a
</p>
<p>conspiracy with them to kill and murder, within your capital and
</p>
<p>your intrenched camp, the Commander-in-Chief of our army, your
</p>
<p>Lieutenant General, and the Vice-President, and the Secretary of
</p>
<p>State, with intent thereby to aid the rebellion, and subvert the
</p>
<p>Constitution and laws of the United States? But it is said that the
</p>
<p>President could not establish a coUrt for their trial, and therefore
</p>
<p>Congress must ratify and affirm this Proclamation. I have said be
</p>
<p>fore that such an argument comes with ill grace from the lips of him
</p>
<p>who declared as solemnly that neither by the Congress nor by the
</p>
<p>President could either the rebel himself or his aider or abettor be
</p>
<p>lawfully and constitutionally subjected to trial by any military tri
</p>
<p>bunal, whether court-martial or military commission. But the Con
</p>
<p>gress did ratify, in the exercise of the power vested in them, every
</p>
<p>part of this Proclamation. I have said, upon the authority of the
</p>
<p>fathers of the Constitution, and of its judicial interpreters, that
</p>
<p>Congress has power by legislation to aid the Executive in the sup
</p>
<p>pression of rebellion, in executing the laws of the Union when re
</p>
<p>sisted by armed insurrection, and in repelling invasion.
</p>
<p>By the act of March 3, 1863, the Congress of the United States,
</p>
<p>by the first section thereof, declared that during the present rebellion
</p>
<p>the President of the United States, whenever in his judgment the
</p>
<p>public safety may require it, is authorized to suspend the writ of
</p>
<p>habeas, corpus in >any case throughout the United States or any part
</p>
<p>thereof. By the fourth section of the same act it is declared that
</p>
<p>any order of the President, 'or under his authority, made at any time
</p>
<p>during the existence of the present rebellion, shall be a defence in all
</p>
<p>courts to any action or prosecution, civil or criminal, pending or to
</p>
<p>be commenced, for any search, seizure, arrest, or imprisonment, made,
</p>
<p>done, or committed, or acts omitted to be done, under and by virtue
</p>
<p>of such order. By the fifth section it is provided, that, if any suit or
</p>
<p>prosecution, civil or criminal, has been or shall be commenced in
</p>
<p>any State court against any officer, civil or military, or against any
</p>
<p>other person, for any arrester imprisonment made, or other trespasses
</p>
<p>or wrongs done or committed, or any act omitted to be done at any

</p>
<p>time during the present rebellion, by virtue of or under color of any
</p>
<p>authority derived from or exercised by or under the President of the
</p>
<p>United States, if the defendant shall, upon appearance in such court,
</p>
<p>file a petition stating the facts upon affidavit, &c, as aforesaid, for the
</p>
<p>removal of the cause for trial to the circuit court of the United States,
</p>
<p>it shall be the duty of the State court, upon his giving security, to
</p>
<p>44
</p>
<p>proceed no further in the cause or prosecution. Thus declaring that
</p>
<p>all orders of the President, made at any time during the existence of
</p>
<p>the present rebellion, and all acts done in pursuance thereof, shall be
</p>
<p>held valid in the courts of justice. Without further inquiry, these
</p>
<p>provisions of this statute embrace Order 141, which is the proclama
</p>
<p>tion of martial law, and necessarily legalize every act done under it,
</p>
<p>either before the passage of the act of 1863 or since. Inasmuch as
</p>
<p>that Proclamation ordered that all rebels, insurgents, their aiders and
</p>
<p>abettors, and persons guilty of any disloyal practice affording aid
</p>
<p>and comfort to rebels against the authority of the United States, at
</p>
<p>any time during the existing insurrection, should be subject to martial
</p>
<p>law, and liable to trial and punishment by a military commission, the
</p>
<p>sections of the law just cited declaring lawful all acts done in pursu
</p>
<p>ance of such order, including, of course, the trial and punishment by
</p>
<p>military commission of all such offenders, as directly legalized this
</p>
<p>order of the President as it is possible for Congress to legalize or au
</p>
<p>thorize any executive act whatever. (VZ Stat, at Large, 755-6.)
</p>
<p>But after assuming and declaring with great earnestness in his
</p>
<p>argument thatno person could be tried and convicted for such crimes
</p>
<p>by any military tribunal, whether a court-martial or a military com
</p>
<p>mission, save those in the land or naval service in time of war, the
</p>
<p>gentleman makes the extraordinary statement that the creation of a
</p>
<p>military commission must be authorized by the legislative department,
</p>
<p>and demands, if there be any such legislation, ' ' let the statute be
</p>
<p>produced." The statute has been produced. The power so to try,
</p>
<p>says the gentleman, must be authorized by Congress, when the de
</p>
<p>mand is made for such authority. Does not the gentleman thereby
</p>
<p>give up his argument, and admit, that if the Congress has so author
</p>
<p>ized the trial of all aiders and abettors of rebels or insurgents for
</p>
<p>whatever they do in aid of such rebels and insurgents during the in
</p>
<p>surrection, the statute and proceedings under it are lawful and
</p>
<p>valid ? I have already shown that the Congress have so legislated
</p>
<p>by expressly legalizing Order No. 141, which directed the trial of all
</p>
<p>rebels, their aiders and abettors, by military commission. Did not
</p>
<p>Congress expressly legalize this order by declaring that the order

</p>
<p>shall be a defence in all courts to any action or prosecution, civil or
</p>
<p>criminal, for acts done in pursuance of it? No amount of argument
</p>
<p>could make this point clearer than the language of the statute itself.
</p>
<p>But, says the gentleman, if there be a statute authorizing trials by
</p>
<p>military commission, "Let it be produced."
</p>
<p>By the act of March 3, 1863, it is provided in section thirty that
</p>
<p>45
</p>
<p>in time of war, insurrection, or rebellion, murder and assault with
</p>
<p>intent to kill, &c.,when committed by persons in the military service,
</p>
<p>shall be punishable by the sentence of a court-martial or military
</p>
<p>commission, and the punishment of sueh offences shall never be less
</p>
<p>than those inflicted by the laws of the State or District in which they
</p>
<p>may have been committed. By the 38th section of the same act,
</p>
<p>it is provided that all persons who. in time of war or rebellion against
</p>
<p>the United States, shall be found lurking or acting as spies in or
</p>
<p>about the camps, &c, of the United States, or elsewhere, shall be
</p>
<p>triable by a military commission, and shall, upon conviction, suffer
</p>
<p>death. Here is a statute which expressly declares that all persons,
</p>
<p>whether citizens or strangers, who in time of rebellion shall be found
</p>
<p>acting as spies, shall suffer death upon conviction by a military com
</p>
<p>mission. Why did not the gentleman give us some argument upon
</p>
<p>this law ? We have seen that it was the existing law of the United
</p>
<p>States under the Confederation. Then, and since, men not in the land
</p>
<p>or na\*al forces, of the United States have suffered death for this
</p>
<p>offence upon conviction by courts-martial. If it was competent for
</p>
<p>Congress to authorize their trial by courts-martial, it was equally
</p>
<p>competent for Congress to authorize their trial by military commis
</p>
<p>sion, and accordingly they have done so. By the same authority the
</p>
<p>Congress may extend the jurisdiction of military commissions over
</p>
<p>all military offences or crimes committed in time of rebellion, or war
</p>
<p>in aid of the public enefaay ; and it certainly stands with right reason,
</p>
<p>that if it were just to subject to death, by the sentence of a military
</p>
<p>commission, all persons who should be guilty merely of lurking as
</p>
<p>spies in the interests of the public enemy in time of rebellion, though
</p>
<p>they obtained no information, though they inflicted no personal
</p>
<p>injury, but were simply overtaken and detected in the endeavor to
</p>
<p>obtain intelligence for the enemy, those who enter into conspiracy
</p>
<p>with the enemy, not only to lurk as spies in your camp, but to lurk.
</p>
<p>there as murderers and assassins, and who, in pursuance of that con
</p>
<p>spiracy, commit assassination and murder upon the Commander-in-
</p>
<p>Chief of your army within your camp and in aid of rebellion, should
</p>
<p>be subject in like manner to trial by military commission. (Stat, at

<p>Large 12,' 736-' 7, ch. 8.)
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the President having so declared, the Congress, as we
</p>
<p>have stated, have affirmed that his order was valid, and that all per
</p>
<p>sons acting by authority, and consequently as a court pronouncing
</p>
<p>such sentence upon the offender as the usage of war requires, are jus
</p>
<p>tified by the law of the land. With all respect, permit me to say
</p>
<p>46
</p>
<p>that the learned gentleman has manifested more acumen and ability
</p>
<p>in his elaborate argument by what he has omitted to say than by any
</p>
<p>thing which he has said. By the act of July 2, 1864, cap. 215, it is
</p>
<p>provided that the commanding general in the field, or the commander
</p>
<p>of the department, as the case may be, shall have power to carry into
</p>
<p>execution all sentences against guerilla marauders for robbery, arson,
</p>
<p>btirglary, &c, and for violation of the laws and customs of war, as
</p>
<p>well as sentences against spies, mutineers, deserters, and murderers.
</p>
<p>From the legislation I have cited, it is apparent that military com
</p>
<p>missions are expressly recognized by the law-making power ; that
</p>
<p>they are authorized to try capital offences against citizens not in the
</p>
<p>service of the United States, and to pronounce the sentence of death
</p>
<p>upon them ; and that the commander of a department, or the com
</p>
<p>manding general in the field, may carry such sentence into execution.
</p>
<p>But, says the gentleman, grant all this tO be so ; Congress has not
</p>
<p>declared in what manner the court shall be constituted. The answer
</p>
<p>to that objection has already been anticipated in the citation from
</p>
<p>Benet, wherein it appeared to be the rule of the law martial that in
</p>
<p>the punishment of all military offences not provided for by the written
</p>
<p>law of the land, military commissions are constituted for that purpose
</p>
<p>by the authority of the commanding officer or the Commander-in-
</p>
<p>Chief, as the case may be, who selects the officers of a court-martial ;
</p>
<p>that they are similarly constituted, and their proceedings conducted
</p>
<p>according to the same general rules. That is a part of the very law
</p>
<p>martial which the Presidentproclaimed, and which the Congress has
</p>
<p>legalized. The Proclamation has declared that all such offenders
</p>
<p>shall be tried by military commissions. The Congress has legalized
</p>
<p>the" same by the act which I have cited ; and by every intendment it
</p>
<p>must be taken that, as martial law is by the Proclamation declared to
</p>
<p>be the rule by which they shall be tried, the Congress, in affirming
</p>
<p>the act of the President, simply declared that they should be tried
</p>
<p>according to the customs of martial law ; that the commission should
</p>
<p>be constituted by the Commander-in-Chief according to the rule of
</p>
<p>procedure known as martial law; and that the penalties inflicted
</p>
<p>should be in accordance with the laws of war and the usages of na

<p>tions. Legislation no more definite than this has been upon your
</p>
<p>statute-book since the beginning of the century, and has been held
</p>
<p>by the Supreme Court of the United States valid for the punishment
</p>
<p>of offenders.
</p>
<p>By the 32d article of the act of 23d April, 1800, it is provided that
</p>
<p>' ' all crimes committed by persons belonging to the navy which are
</p>
<p>not specified in the foregoi .._ '.'.;. ' " ' "-1 -"" .-.v., to
</p>
<p>47
</p>
<p>the laws and customs in such cases at sea." Of this article the Su
</p>
<p>preme Court of the United States say, that when offences and crimes
</p>
<p>are not given in terms or by definition, the want of it may be supplied
</p>
<p>by a comprehensive enactment such as the, 32d article of the rules
</p>
<p>for the government of the navy; which means that courts- martial
</p>
<p>have jurisdiction of such crimes as are not specified, but which have
</p>
<p>been recognized to be crimes and offences by the usages in the navies
</p>
<p>of all nations,, and that they shall be punished according to the laws
</p>
<p>and customs of the sea. (Dynes vs. Hoover, 20 Howard, 82.)
</p>
<p>But it is a fact that must not be omitted in the reply which I make
</p>
<p>to the gentleman's argument, that an effort was made by himself and
</p>
<p>others in the Senate of the United States, oh the 3d of March last, to
</p>
<p>condemn the arrests,1 imprisonments, &c, made by order of the
</p>
<p>President of the United States in- pursuance of his proclamation, and
</p>
<p>to reverse, by the judgment of that body, the law which had been
</p>
<p>before passed affirming his action, which effort most signally failed.
</p>
<p>Thus we see that the body which by the Constitution, if the
</p>
<p>President had been guilty of the misdemeanors alleged against him in
</p>
<p>this argument of. the gentleman, would, upon presentation of such
</p>
<p>charge in legal form against the President, constitute the high court
</p>
<p>of impeachment for his trial and condemnation, has decided the ques
</p>
<p>tion in advance, and declared upon the occasion referred to, as they
</p>
<p>had before declared by solemn , enactment, that this order of the
</p>
<p>President declaring martial law and the punishment of all rebels and
</p>
<p>insurgents, their aiders and abettors, by military commission, should
</p>
<p>be enforced during the insurrection, as the law of the land, and that the
</p>
<p>offenders should be tried, as directed, by military commission. It may
</p>
<p>be said that this subsequent legislation of Congress, ratifying and
</p>
<p>affirming what had been done by the President, can have no validity.
</p>
<p>Of course it cannot if neither the Congress nor the Executive can
</p>
<p>authorize the proclamation and enforcement of martial law in the
</p>
<p>suppression of rebellion for the punishment of all persons committing
</p>
<p>military offences in aid of that rebellion. Assuming, however, as the
</p>
<p>gentleman seemed to assume, by asking for the legislation of Con
</p>
<p>gress, that there is such power in Congress, the Supreme Court of

</p>
<p>the United States has solemnly affirmed that such ratification is
</p>
<p>valid. (2 Black, 671.)
</p>
<p>The gentleman's argument is full of citations of English precedent.
</p>
<p>There is a late English precedent bearing upon this point  the power
</p>
<p>of the legislature, by subsequent enactment, to legalize executive
</p>
<p>orders, arrests, and imprisonment of citizens  that I beg leave to
</p>
<p>commend to his consideration. I refer to the statute of 11 and 12
</p>
<p>48
</p>
<p>Victoria, ch. 35, entitled "An act to empower the lord lieutenant,
</p>
<p>or other chief governor or governors of Ireland, to apprehend and de
</p>
<p>tain until the first day of March, 1849, such persons as he or they
</p>
<p>shall suspect of conspiring against her Majesty's person and govern
</p>
<p>ment," passed July 25, 1848, which statute in terms declares that
</p>
<p>all and every person aud persons who is, are, or shall be, within that
</p>
<p>period, within that part of the United Kingdom of England and Ire
</p>
<p>land called Ireland at or on the day the act shall receive her Majesty's
</p>
<p>royal assent, or after, by warrant for high treason or treasonable
</p>
<p>practices, or suspicion of high treason or treasonable practices, signed
</p>
<p>by the lord lieutenant, or other Chief governor or governors of Ire
</p>
<p>land for the time being, or his or their chief secretary, for such causes
</p>
<p>as aforesaid, may be detained in safe custody without bail or main
</p>
<p>prize, until the first day of March. 1849; and that no judge or justice
</p>
<p>shall bail or try any such person or persons so committed, without
</p>
<p>order from her Majesty's privy council, until the said first day of
</p>
<p>March, 1849, any. law or statute to the contrary notwithstanding.
</p>
<p>The 2d section of this act provides that, in cases where any persons
</p>
<p>have been, before the passing of the act, arrested, committed, or de
</p>
<p>tained for such cause by warrant or warrants signed by the officers
</p>
<p>aforesaid, or either of them, it may be lawful for the person or per
</p>
<p>sons to whom such warrants have been or shall be directed, to detain
</p>
<p>such person or persons in his, or their, custody in any plaee whatever
</p>
<p>in Ireland; and that such person or persons to whom such warrants
</p>
<p>have been or shall be directed shall be deemed and taken, to all in
</p>
<p>tents and purposes, lawfully authorized to take into safe custody and
</p>
<p>be the lawful jailers and keepers of such persons so arrested, com
</p>
<p>mitted, or detained.
</p>
<p>Here the power of arrest is given by the act of Parliament to the
</p>
<p>governor or his secretary; ,the process of the civil courts was wholly
</p>
<p>suspended; bail was denied and the parties imprisoned, and this not
</p>
<p>by process of the courts, but by warrant of a chief governor or his
</p>
<p>secretary; not for crimes charged to have been committed, but for be
</p>
<p>ing suspected of treasonable practices. Magna charta it seems op
</p>
<p>poses no restraint, notwithstanding the parade that is made about it

<p>in this argument, upon the power of the Parliament of England to
</p>
<p>legalize arrests and imprisonments made before the passage of the
</p>
<p>act upon an executive order, and without colorable authority of statute
</p>
<p>law, and to authorize like arrests and imprisonments of so many of
</p>
<p>six million of people as such executive officers might suspect of trea-;
</p>
<p>sonable practices. ;
</p>
<p>49
</p>
<p>But, says the gentleman, whatever may be the precedents, English
</p>
<p>ox American, whatever may be the provisions of the Constitution,
</p>
<p>whatever may be the legislation of Congress; whatever may be the
</p>
<p>proclamations and orders of the President as commander-in-chief, it is a
</p>
<p>usurpation and a tyranny in time of rebellion and civil war to subject
</p>
<p>any citizen to trial for any crime before military tribunals, save such*
</p>
<p>citizens as are in the: land or. naval forces, and, against this usurpa
</p>
<p>tion, which he. asks this court to rebuke by solemn decision, he appeals
</p>
<p>to public opinion. I trust, that. I set as high value upon enlightened-
</p>
<p>public opinion as any man. I. recognize it as the reserved power of
</p>
<p>tiie^ people which creates and. dissolves armies, which creates and
</p>
<p>dissolves legislative, assemblies, which enacts and repeals fundamental
</p>
<p>laws,, the better to provide for personal security by the due adminis*
</p>
<p>tiation of justice. To that public opinion upon this very question of
</p>
<p>the' usurpation of authority, of unlawful arrests, and unlawful im
</p>
<p>prisonments, and unlawful trials, condemnations, and executions by
</p>
<p>the: late President of the United States, an appeal has already
</p>
<p>been, taken i. On this very issue the President was tried before
</p>
<p>the tribunal of the people, that great nation of freemen who cover
</p>
<p>this continent, looking out upon Europe from their eastern and upon
</p>
<p>Asia from their western homes. That people came to the consideration
</p>
<p>of this issue not unmindful of the fact that the first struggle for the*
</p>
<p>establishment of our nationality could not have been, and was not, suc
</p>
<p>cessfully prosecuted without the proclamation and enforcement of
</p>
<p>martial law, declaring, as we have seen, that any inhabitant who,
</p>
<p>during that war, should kill any loyal citizen, or enter into any com
</p>
<p>bination for that purpose, should, upon trial and conviction before a
</p>
<p>military tribunal, be sentenced as an assassin, traitor, or spy, and
</p>
<p>should, suffer death, and that in this last struggle for the maintenance
</p>
<p>of American nationality the President but followed the example of
</p>
<p>the illustrious Father of his Country. Upon that issue the people
</p>
<p>passed judgment on the 8th day of last November, and declared that
</p>
<p>the charge of usurpation was false.
</p>
<p>From this decision of the people there lies no appeal on this earth.

<p>thus solemnly proclaimed, by the omnipotence of the ballot, in favor

<p>of. the righteous order of their murdered President, issued by him

<p>for the common defence, for. the preservation of the Constitutipn, and

</p>
<p>May it please the Court: I have said thus much touching the right
</p>
<p>of the people, under their Constitution, in time of civil war and re
</p>
<p>bellion, to proclaim through their Executive, with the sanction and
</p>
<p>approval of their Congress, martial law,'and enforce the same according
</p>
<p>to the usage of nations.
</p>
<p>I submit that it has been shown that, by the letter and spirit
</p>
<p>of the Constitution, as well as by its contemporaneous construction,
</p>
<p>followed and approved by 'every department of the government, this
</p>
<p>right is in the people ; that it i3 inseparable from the condition of
</p>
<p>war, whether civil or foreign, and absolutely essential to its vigorous
</p>
<p>and successful prosecution ; that according to the highest authority
</p>
<p>upon constitutional law, the proclamation and enforcement of martial
</p>
<p>law are "usual under all governments in time of rebellion;" that Our
</p>
<p>own lighest judicial tribunal has declared this, and solemnly ruled
</p>
<p>'mat the question of the necessity for its exercise rests exclusively
</p>
<p>with Congress and the President ; and that the decision of the politi
</p>
<p>cal departments of the government, that there is an armed rebellion
</p>
<p>and a necessity for the employment of military force and martial law
</p>
<p>in its suppression, concludes the judiciary.
</p>
<p>In submitting what I have said in support of the jurisdiction of this
</p>
<p>honorable court, and of its constitutional power to hear and determine
</p>
<p>this issue, I have uttered my own convictions ; and for their utter
</p>
<p>ance in defence of my country, and its right to employ all the means
</p>
<p>necessary for the cOmmon defence against armed rebellion and secret
</p>
<p>treasonable conspiracy in aid of such rebellion, I shall neither ask
</p>
<p>pardon nor offer apology. I find no words with which more fitly to
</p>
<p>conclude all I have to say upon the question of the jurisdiction and
</p>
<p>constitutional authority of this court than those employed by the
</p>
<p>illustrious Lord Brougham to the House of Peers in support of the
</p>
<p>bill before referred to, which empowered the lord lieutenant of
</p>
<p>Ireland, and his deputies, to apprehend and detain, for the period of
</p>
<p>seven months or more, all such persons within that island as they
</p>
<p>should suspect of conspiracy against her Majesty's person and govern

<p>ment. Said that illustrious man : ' 'A friend of liberty I have lived;

<p>traitors at the same time  a protector of criminals of the deepest.

<p>war, with all its atrocities and all its fearful consequences." (Han '-'

</p>
<p>Mat it please the Court : It only remains for me to* sum up the
</p>
<p>evidence, and present my views of the law arising Upon the facta in
</p>
<p>the case on trial. The questions of fact-involvedin the issue are :
</p>
<p>First, did the* accused, or any two of them, confederate and con
</p>
<p>spire together as charged ? and 
</p>
<p>Second, did the accused, or any of them, in pursuance of such con
</p>
<p>spiracy, and with the intent alleged, commit either or all of the sev
</p>
<p>eral acts specified ?
</p>
<p>If the conspiracy be established, as laid, it results that whatever was
</p>
<p>said or done by either of the parties thereto, in the furtherance or exe
</p>
<p>cution of the common design, is the declaration or act of all the other
</p>
<p>parties^ to the conspiracy; and this, whether the other parties, at the
</p>
<p>time such words Were uttered or such acts done by their confederates,
</p>
<p>were present or absent  here, within the intrenched lines of your
</p>
<p>capital, or crouching behind the intrenched lines of Richmond, or
</p>
<p>awaiting the results of their murderous plot, against their country, its
</p>
<p>Constitution and laws, across the border, under the shelter of the
</p>
<p>British flag.
</p>
<p>The declared and accepted rule of law in cases of conspiracy is
</p>
<p>that "In prosecutions for eonspiracy it is an established rule that
</p>
<p>where several persons are proved to have combined together for the
</p>
<p>same illegal purpose, any act done by one of the party, in pursuance
</p>
<p>of the original concerted plan, and in reference to the common object,
</p>
<p>is, in the contemplation of law as well as in sound reason, the act of
</p>
<p>the whole party; and, therefore, the proof of the act will be evidence
</p>
<p>against any of the others, who were engaged in the same general
</p>
<p>conspiracy, without regard to the question whether the prisoner is
</p>
<p>proved to have been concerned in the particular transaction."
</p>
<p>(Phillips on Evidence, p. 210.)
</p>
<p>The same rule obtains in cases- of treason: "If several persons
</p>
<p>agree to levy war, some in one place and some in another, and one
</p>
<p>party do actually appear in arms, this is a levying of war by all,.
</p>
<p>as well those who were not in arms as those who were, if it were
</p>
<p>done in pursuance of the original concert, for those who made the
</p>
<p>attempt were emboldened by the confidence inspired by the general

</p>
<p>concert, and therefore these particular acts are in justice imputable
</p>
<p>to all the rest." (1 East., Pleas of the Crown, p. 97; Roscoe, 84.)
</p>
<p>In Ex parte Bollman and Swartwout, 4 Cranch, 126, Marshall, Chief
</p>
<p>Justice rules: "If war be actually levied that is, if a body of men be
</p>
<p>52
</p>
<p>actually assembled, for the purpose of effecting, by force, a treasonable
</p>
<p>purpose, all those who perform any part, however minute, or however
</p>
<p>remote from the scene of action, and who are actually leagued in the
</p>
<p>general conspiracy, are to be considered as traitors."
</p>
<p>In United States vs. Gole et al., 5 McLean, 601, Mr. -Justice McLean
</p>
<p>says: "A conspiracy is rarely, if ever, proved by positive testimony.,
</p>
<p>When a crime of high magnitude is about to be perpetrated by a
</p>
<p>combination of individuals, they do not act openly but covertly and se-.
</p>
<p>cretly. The purpose formed is known only to those who enter into
</p>
<p>it. Unless one of the original conspirators betray hjs companions
</p>
<p>and give evidence against them, their guilt can be proved only by cir
</p>
<p>cumstantial evidence. * * It is said by some writers on evidence.
</p>
<p>that such circumstances are stronger than positive proof. A witness
</p>
<p>swearing positively, it is said, may misapprehend the facts or swear
</p>
<p>falsely, but that circumstances cannot lie.
</p>
<p>"The common design is the essence of the: charge ; and this may
</p>
<p>be made to appear when the defendants steadily pursue the same
</p>
<p>object, whether acting separately or together, by common or differ
</p>
<p>ent means, all leading to the same unlawful result. And where
</p>
<p>prima facie evidence has been given of a combination, the acts or con
</p>
<p>fessions of one are evidence against all. * * It is reasonable thai
</p>
<p>where a body of men assume the attribute of individuality, whethei
</p>
<p>for commercial business or for the commission of a crime, that the
</p>
<p>association should be bound by the acts of one of its members, in
</p>
<p>carrying out the design."
</p>
<p>It is a rule of the law, not to be overlooked in this connexion, that
</p>
<p>the conspiracy or agreement of the parties, or some of them, to act
</p>
<p>in concert to accomplish the unlawful act charged, may be established
</p>
<p>either by direct evidence of a meeting or consultation for the illegal
</p>
<p>purpose charged, or more usually, from the very nature of the case,
</p>
<p>by circumstantial evidence. (2 Starkie, 232.)
</p>
<p>Lord Mansfield ruled that it was not necessary to prove the actual
</p>
<p>fact of a conspiracy, but that it might be collected from collateral
</p>
<p>circumstances. (Parson's Case, 1 W. Blackstone, 392.)
</p>
<p>"If," says a great authority on the law of evidence, " on a charge

</p>
<p>of conspiracy, it appear that two persons by their acts are pursuing
</p>
<p>the same object, and often by the same means, or one performing
</p>
<p>part of the act, and the other completing it, for the attainment of the
</p>
<p>same object, the jury may draw the conclusion there is. a conspiracy.
</p>
<p>If a conspiracy be formed, aud a person join in it afterwards, he is
</p>
<p>equally guilty with the original conspirators." (Roscoe, 415.)
</p>
<p>53
</p>
<p>' 'The rule of the admissibility of the acts arid declarations of any one
</p>
<p>of the conspirators, said or done in furtherance of the common de
</p>
<p>sign, applies in cases as well Where only part of the conspirators are
</p>
<p>indicted, or upon trial, as Where all are indicted and upon trial.
</p>
<p>Thus, upon an indictment for murder, if it appear that others, together
</p>
<p>with' the prisoner, conspired to commit the crime, the act of one,
</p>
<p>done in pursuance of that intention, will be evidence against the
</p>
<p>test." (2d Starkie, ' 237.)
</p>
<p>They are all alike guilty as principals. (Commonwealth vs. Knapp,
</p>
<p>9 Pickering, 496; 10 Pickering, 477; 6 Term Reports, 528; 11 East.,
</p>
<p>584.) What is the evidence, direct and circumstantial, that the accused,
</p>
<p>ot either of them, together with John H. Surratt, John Wilkes Booth,
</p>
<p>JeffersOn Davis, George N. Sanders, Beverley Tucker, Jacob Thomp
</p>
<p>son, William C. Cleary,. Clement C. Clay, George Harper, and
</p>
<p>George Young, did combine, confederate, and conspire, in aid of the
</p>
<p>existing rebellion, as charged, to kill and murder, within the military
</p>
<p>department of Washington, and within the fortified and intrenched
</p>
<p>lines thereof, Abraham Lincoln, late, and, at the time of the said
</p>
<p>combining, confederating, and conspiring, President of the United
</p>
<p>States of America and commander-in-chief of the army and navy
</p>
<p>thereof; Andrew Johnson, Vice President of the United States;
</p>
<p>William H. Seward, Secretary of State of the United States; and
</p>
<p>Ulysses S. Grant, lieutenant general of the armies thereof, and then
</p>
<p>in command, under the direction of the President?
</p>
<p>The time, as laid in the charge and specification, when this con
</p>
<p>spiracy was entered into, is immaterial, so that it appear by the evi
</p>
<p>dence that the criminal combination and agreement were formed be
</p>
<p>fore the commission of the acts alleged. That Jefferson Davis, one
</p>
<p>of the conspirators named, was the acknowledged chief and leader of

<p>the existing, rebellion against the government of the United States.
</p>
<p>and that Jacob Thompson, George N. -Sanders, Clement C. Clay,
</p>
<p>Beverley Tucker, and others named in the specification, were his duly
</p>
<p>accredited and authorized agents to act in theinterests of said rebel

<p>lion, are facts established by the testimony in this case beyond all

<p>question. That Davis, as the leader of said rebellion, gave to those

<p>agents, then in Canada, commissions in blank, bearing the official
</p>
<p>signature of his war minister, James A. Seddon, to be by them filled
</p>

<p>interests of the rebellion within the United States, and intended to
</p>
<p>be a cover and protection for any crimes they might therein commit
</p>
<p>54
</p>
<p>in the service of the rebellion, is also a fact established here, and
</p>
<p>which no man can gainsay. Who doubts that Kennedy, whose
</p>
<p>confession, made in view of immediate death, as proved here,
</p>
<p>was commissioned by those accredited agents of Davis to burn
</p>
<p>the city of New York?  that he! was to have attempted it on
</p>
<p>the night of the presidential election, and that he -did, in com
</p>
<p>bination with his confederates, set fire to four hotels in the
</p>
<p>city of New York on the night of the 25th of November last?
</p>
<p>Who doubts that, in like manner, in the interests of the rebellion
</p>
<p>and by the authority of Davis, these his agents also commissioned
</p>
<p>Bennett H. Young to commit arson, robbery, and the murder of un
</p>
<p>armed citizens, in St. Albans, Vermont? Who doubts, upon the
</p>
<p>testimony shown, that Davis, by his agents, deliberately adopted the
</p>
<p>system of starvation for the murder of our captive soldiers in his
</p>
<p>hands ; or that, as shown by the testimony, he sanctioned the burn
</p>
<p>ing of hospitals and steamboats, the property of private persons,
</p>
<p>and paid therefor, from his stolen treasure the sum of thirty-five
</p>
<p>thousand dollars in gold? By the evidence of Joseph Godfrey Hyams
</p>
<p>it is proved that Thompson  the agent of Jefferson Davis  paid him
</p>
<p>money for the service he rendered in the infamous and fiendish pro
</p>
<p>ject of importing pestilence into our camps and cities to destroy the
</p>
<p>lives of citizens and soldiers alike, and into the house of the Presi
</p>
<p>dent for the purpose of destroying his life. It may be said, and
</p>
<p>doubtless will be said, by the pensioned advocates of this rebellion,
</p>
<p>that Hyams, being infamous, is not to be believed. It is admitted
</p>
<p>that he is infamous, as it must be conceded that any man is infamous
</p>
<p>who either participates in such a crime or attempts in anywise to
</p>
<p>extenuate, it. But it will be observed that Hyams is supported by
</p>
<p>the testimony of Mr. Sanford Conover, who heard Blackburn and the
</p>
<p>other rebel agents in Canada speak of this infernal project, and by
</p>
<p>the testimony of Mr. Wall , the well-known auctioneer of this city,
</p>
<p>whose character is unquestioned, that he received this importatiou of
</p>
<p>pestilence, (of course without any knowledge of the purpose,) and
</p>
<p>that Hyams consigned the goods to him in the name of J. W. Harris
</p>
<p>a fact in itself an acknowledgment of guilt ; and that he received

<p>afterwards a letter from Harris, dated Toronto, Canada West, Decem
</p>
<p>ber 1, 1864, wherein Harris stated that he had not been able to
</p>
<p>come to the States since his return to Canada, and asked for an
</p>
<p>account of the sale. He identifies the Godfrey Joseph Hyams
</p>
<p>who testified in court as the J. W. Harris who imported the pes*
</p>
<p>tilence. The very transaction shows that Hyams' s statement is
</p>
<p>55
</p>
<p>truthful. He gives the names of the parties connected with this
</p>
<p>infamy, (Clement C. Clay, Dr. Blackburn, Rev. Dr. Stuart Robin
</p>
<p>son, J. C. Holcombe  all refugees from the confederacy in Canada,)
</p>
<p>and states that he gave Thompson a .receipt for the fifty dollars paid
</p>
<p>to him, and that he was by occupation a shoemaker ; in none of which
</p>
<p>facts is there an attempt' to discredit him. It is not probable that a
</p>
<p>man in his. position in life would be able to buy five trunks of cloth
</p>
<p>ing, ship them all, the way from Halifax to Washington, and then
</p>
<p>order them to be sold at auction, without regard to price, solely upon
</p>
<p>his own account. It is a matter of notoriety that a part of his state
</p>
<p>ment is verified by the results at Newbern, North Carolina, to
</p>
<p>which point, he says, a portion of the infected goods were shipped,
</p>
<p>through a sutler ; the result of which was, that nearly two thousand
</p>
<p>citizens and soldiers died there about that time with the yellow fever.
</p>
<p>That the rebel chief, Jefferson Davis, sanctioned these crimes,
</p>
<p>committed and attempted through the instrumentality of his accred
</p>
<p>ited agents in Canada  Thompson, Clay, Tucker, Sanders, Cleary,
</p>
<p>&c.  upon the persons and property of the people of the north, there
</p>
<p>is positive proof on j^our record. . The letter brought from Richmond,
</p>
<p>and taken from the archives of his late pretended government there,
</p>
<p>dated February 11, 1865, and addressed to him by a late rebel sena
</p>
<p>tor from Texas, W. S. Oldham, contains the following significant
</p>
<p>words : "When senator Johnson, of Missouri, and myself waited on
</p>

</p>
<p>which I was not fully prepared to answer, but which, upon sub

<p>ble materials' consist of several preparations, and not one. alone,
</p>
<p>and can be used without exposing the party using them to the
</p>
<p>least danger of detection whatever.. * * * Second, there is no
</p>
<p>necessity for sending persons in the military service into the enemy's
</p>

<p>seen enough of the effects that can be produced to satisfy me that

</p>
<p>in most cases, without any danger to the parties engaged, and in
</p>
<p>others but very slight, we can, first, burn every vessel that leaves a
</p>
<p>foreign port for the United States ; second, we can burn every trans
</p>
<p>port that leaves the harbor of New York, or other northern port,
</p>
<p>with supplies for the armies of the enemy in the south ; third,
</p>
<p>burn every transport and gunboat on the Mississippi river, as well
</p>
<p>56
</p>
<p>as devastate the country of the enemy, and fill his' people with ter-'
</p>
<p>ror and consternation. * * * For the purpose of satisfying your
</p>
<p>mind upon the subject, I respectfully, but earnestly, request that you
</p>
<p>will give an interview with General Harris, formerly a member of
</p>
<p>Congress from Missouri, who, I think, is able, from conclusive proofs,
</p>
<p>to convince you that what I have suggested is perfectly feasible and
</p>
<p>practicable." No one can doubt, from the tenor of this letter, that the rebel Davis
</p>
<p>only wanted to be satisfied that this system of arson and murder,
</p>
<p>could be carried on by his agents in the north successfully and with
</p>
<p>out detection. With him it was not a crime to do these acts, but
</p>
<p>only a crime to be detected in them. But Davis, by his indorsement
</p>
<p>on this letter, dated the 20th of February, 1865. bears witness to
</p>
<p>his own complicity and his own infamy in this proposed work of de
</p>
<p>struction and crime for the future, as well as to his complicity in
</p>
<p>what had before been attempted without complete success. Ken
</p>
<p>nedy, with his confederates, had failed to burn the city of New York.
</p>
<p>"The combustibles" which Kennedy had employed were, it seems,
</p>
<p>defective. This was "a difficulty to be overcome." Neither had
</p>
<p>he been able to consummate the dreadful work without subjecting
</p>
<p>himself to detection. , This was another "difficulty to be overcome."
</p>
<p>Davis, on the 20th of February, 1865, indorsed upon this letter these
</p>
<p>words : "Secretary of State, at his convenience, see General Harris
</p>
<p>and learn what plan he has for overcoming the difficulties heretofore ex
</p>
<p>perienced. J. D."
</p>
<p>This indorsement is unquestionably proved to be the handwriting
</p>
<p>of Jefferson Davis, and it bears witness on its face that the monstrous
</p>
<p>proposition met his approval, and that he desired his rebel Secretary
</p>
<p>of State, Benjamin, to see General Harris and learn how to over
</p>
<p>come the difficulty heretofore experienced, to wit: the inefficiency of
</p>
<p>"the combustible materials" that had been employed, and the lia^
</p>
<p>bility of his agents to detection. After this, who will doubt that he
</p>
<p>had endeavored, by the hand of incendiaries, to destroy by fire the
</p>
<p>property and lives of the people of the north, and thereby "fill them
</p>
<p>with terror and consternation ;" that he knew his agents had been
</p>
<p>unsuccessful ; that he knew his agents had been fleteGted in their

</p>
<p>villany and punished for their crime ; that he desired through a more
</p>
<p>perfect "chemical preparation," by the science and skill of Professor
</p>
<p>McCulloch, to accomplish successfully what had before been unsuc
</p>
<p>cessfully attempted ?
</p>
<p>The intercepted letter of his agent, Clement C. Clay, dated St,
</p>
<p>57
</p>
<p>Catherine's, Canada West, November I, 1864, is an acknowledgment
</p>
<p>and confession of what they had attempted, and a suggestion made
</p>
<p>through J. P. Benjamin, rebel Secretary of State, of "what remained
</p>
<p>to be done, in order to make the "chemical preparations" efficient.
</p>
<p>Speaking of this Bennett H. Young, he says : "You have doubtless
</p>
<p>learned through the press of the United States of the raid on St. Albans
</p>
<p>by about twenty-five confederate soldiers,led by LieutenantBennett H.
</p>
<p>Young ; of their attempt and failure to burn the town ; of their robbery
</p>
<p>of three banks there of the aggregate amount of about two hundred
</p>
<p>thousand dollars ; of their arrest in Canada, by United States forces ; of
</p>
<p>'their commitment and the pending preliminary trial." He make's ap
</p>
<p>plication, inaid of Young and his associates, for additional documents,
</p>
<p>showing that they acted upon the authority of the Confederate States
</p>
<p>government, taking care to say, however, that he held such authority at
</p>
<p>the time, but that it ought to be more explicit, so far as regards the par'
</p>
<p>ticular acts complained of. He states that he met Young at Halifax in
</p>
<p>May, 1864, who developed his plans for retaliation on the enemy; that
</p>
<p>he, Clay, recommended him to the rebel Secretary of War; that after
</p>
<p>this "Young was sent back by -the Secretary of War with a commission
</p>
<p>as second lieutenant to execute his plans and purposes, but to report to
</p>
<p>Hon. and, myself" Young afterwards "proposed passing
</p>
<p>through New England, burning some towns and robbing them of
</p>
<p>whatever he could convert to the use of the confederate government.
</p>
<p>This I approved as justifiable retaliation. He attempted to burn the
</p>
<p>town of St. Albans, Vermont, and would have succeededbut for the fail
</p>
<p>ure of the chemical preparation with which he was armed. He then
</p>
<p>robbed the banks of funds amounting to over two hundred thousand
</p>
<p>dollars. That he was not prompted by selfish or mercenary motives
</p>
<p>I am as well satisfied as I am that he is an honest man. He assured
</p>
<p>me before going that his effort would be to destroy towns and farm
</p>
<p>houses, but not to plunder or rob; but he said if, after firing a town,
</p>
<p>he saw he could take funds from a bank or any house, and thereby
</p>
<p>might inflict injury upon the enemy and benefit his own government,
</p>
<p>he would do so. He added most emphatically, that wlmtever he took
</p>
<p>should be turned over to the government or its representatives in for

</p>
<p>eign lands. My instructions to him were, to destroy whatever was
</p>
<p>Valuable; not to stop to rob, but if after firing a town, he could seize
</p>
<p>and carry off money or treasury or bank notes, he might do so upon
</p>
<p>condition that they were delivered to the proper authorities of the
</p>
<p>Confederate States"  that is, to Clay himself.
</p>
<p>When he wrote this letter it seems that this accredited agent of
</p>
<p>58
</p>
<p>Jefferson Davis was as strongly impressed with the usurpation and
</p>
<p>despotism of Mr. Lincoln's administration as some of tlw advocates of
</p>
<p>his aiders and -abettors seem to be at this day ; and he indulges in the
</p>
<p>following statement : "All that a large portion of the northern people,
</p>
<p>especially in the northwest, want to resist the oppressions of the. des
</p>
<p>potism at Washington is a leader. They are ripe for resistance, and
</p>
<p>it may come soon after tlie presidential election. At all events, it must
</p>
<p>come, if our armies are not overcome, or destroyed, or dispersed.
</p>
<p>No people of the Anglo-Saxon blood can long endure the usurpations
</p>
<p>and tyrannies of Lincoln." -Clay does not sign the despatch, but
</p>
<p>indorses the bearer of it as a person who can identify him and give
</p>
<p>his name . The bearer of that letter was the witness Richard Mont
</p>
<p>gomery, who saw Clay write a portion of the letter, and received it
</p>
<p>from his hands, and subsequently delivered it to the Assistant Secre
</p>
<p>tary of War of the United States, Mr. Dana. That the letter is in
</p>
<p>Clay's handwriting is clearly proved by those familiar with it. Mr.
</p>
<p>Montgomery testifies that he was instructed by Clay to deliver this
</p>
<p>letter to Benjamin, the rebel Secretary of State, if he could get
</p>
<p>through to Richmond, and to tell him what names to put in the
</p>
<p>blanks. This letter leaves no doubt, if any before existed in the mind of
</p>
<p>any one who had read the letter of Oldham and Davis's indorsement
</p>
<p>thereon, that "the chemical preparations" and " combustible mate
</p>
<p>rials" had been tried and had failed, and it had become a matter of
</p>
<p>great moment and concern that they should be so prepared as, in the
</p>
<p>words of Davis, "to overcome the difficulties heretofore expert
</p>
<p>enced ;" that is to say, complete the work of destruction, and secure
</p>
<p>the perpetrators against personal injury or detection in the perform
</p>
<p>ance of it.
</p>
<p>It only remains to be seen whether Davis, the procurer of arson
</p>
<p>and of the indiscriminate murder of the innocent and unoffending
</p>
<p>necessarily resultant therefrom, was capable also of endeavoring to
</p>
<p>procure, and in fact did procure, the murder, by direct assassination,
</p>
<p>of the President of the United States and others charged with the duty
</p>
<p>of maintaining the government of the United States, and of suppressing
</p>
<p>the rebellion in which this arch-traitor and conspirator was engaged.

<p>The official papers of Davis, captured under the guus of our victo

<p>of doubt, and placed upon your record, together With the declara

<p>59
</p>
<p>procuration of the murder of the late President, and other chief of
</p>
<p>ficers of the United States, by the hands of hired assassins.
</p>
<p>In the fall of 1864 Lieutenant W. Alston addresses to "his excel
</p>
<p>lency" a letter now before the court, which contains the following
</p>
<p>words :
</p>
<p>"I now- offer you my services, and if you will favor me in my designs,
</p>
<p>I. will proceed, as soon as my health will pei'mit, to rid my country of
</p>
<p>some of her deadliest enemies, by striking at the very hearts' blood of
</p>
<p>those who seek to enchain her in slavery. I consider nothing dishon
</p>
<p>orable having such a tendency. All I ask of you is, to favor me by
</p>
<p>granting me the necessary papers, &c, to travel on. * * * *
</p>
<p>I am perfectly familiar with the north, and feel confident that lean
</p>
<p>execute anything I undertake. , I was in the raid last June in Ken
</p>
<p>tucky, under General John H. Morgan; * * * was taken prisr
</p>
<p>oner; * * * escaped from them by dressing myself in the garb
</p>
<p>of a citizen. *' * * I went through to the Canadas, from whence,
</p>
<p>by the assistance, of Colonel J. P. Holcomb, I succeeded in working my
</p>
<p>way around and through the blockade. * * * I should like to
</p>
<p>have a personal interview with you in. order to perfect the arrange
</p>
<p>ments before starting."
</p>
<p>Is there any roohi to doubt that this was a proposition to assas
</p>
<p>sinate, by the hand of this man and his associates, such persons in the
</p>
<p>north as he deemed the "deadliest enemies" of the rebellion? The
</p>
<p>weakness of the man who for a moment can doubt that such was the
</p>
<p>proposition of the writer of this letter is certainly an object of com
</p>
<p>miseration. What had Jefferson" Davis to say to this proposed assas
</p>
<p>sination of the "deadliest enemies" in the north of his great treason ?
</p>
<p>Did the atrocious suggestion kindle in him indignation against the
</p>
<p>villain who offered, with his own hand, to strike the blow? Not
</p>
<p>at all. On the contrary, he ordered his private secretary, on the
</p>
<p>29th of November, 1864, to indorse upon the letter these words:
</p>
<p>"Lieutenant W. Alston; accompanied raid into Kentucky, and was cap
</p>
<p>tured, but escaped into' Canada, from whence he found his way back.
</p>
<p>Now offers bis services to rid the country of some of its deadliest ene

<p>mies; asks for papers, &c. Respectfully referred, by direction of the

<p>President, to the honorable Secretary of War." It is also indorsed,
</p>
<p>for attention, "By order. (Signed) J. A.Campbell, Assistant Secre
</p>
<p>tary of War. ' '
</p>
<p>Note the fact in this connexion, that Jefferson Davis himself, as
</p>
<p>well as his subordinates, had, before the date of this indorsement*
</p>
<p>concluded that Abraham Lincoln was "the deadliest enemy" of the
</p>
<p>60
</p>
<p>rebellion. You hear it in the rebel camp in Virginia in 1863, declare^
</p>
<p>by Booth, then and there present, and assented to by rebel officers,
</p>
<p>that "Abraham Lincoln must be killed." You hear it in that
</p>
<p>slaughter-pen in Georgia, Ahdersonville, proclaimed among rebel
</p>
<p>officers, who, by the slow torture of starvation, inflicted cruel and
</p>
<p>untimely death on ten thousand of your defenders, captives in their
</p>
<p>hands  whispering, like demons, their horrid purpose, "Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln must be killed." And in Canada, the accredited agents of
</p>
<p>Jefferson Davis, as early as October, 1864, and afterwards, declared
</p>
<p>that " Abraham Lincoln must be killed" if his re-election could not
</p>
<p>be prevented. These agents in Canada, on the 13th of October,
</p>
<p>1864, delivered, in cipher, to be transmitted to Richmond by Richard
</p>
<p>Montgomery, the witness, whose reputation is unchallenged, the fol
</p>
<p>lowing communication : "October 13, 1864.
</p>
<p>"We again urge the immense necessity of our gaining immediate
</p>
<p>advantages. Strain every nerve for victory. We now look upon
</p>
<p>the re-election of Lincoln in November as almost certain, and we
</p>
<p>need to whip his hirelings to prevent it. Besides, with Lincoln re
</p>
<p>elected, and his armies victorious, we need not hope even for recog
</p>
<p>nition, much less the help mentioned in our last. Holcomb will ex
</p>
<p>plain this. Those figures of the Yankee armies are correct to a
</p>
<p>unit. Our friends shall be immediately set to ivork as you direct."
</p>
<p>To which an official reply, in cipher, was delivered to Monfc
</p>
<p>gomery by an agent of the state department in Richmond, dated
</p>
<p>October 19, 1864, as follows :
</p>
<p>" Your letter of the 13th instant is at hand. There is yet time
</p>
<p>enough to colonize many voters before November. A blow will shortly
</p>
<p>be stricken here. It is not quite time. General Longstreet is to
</p>
<p>attack Sheridan without delay, and then move north as far as practi
</p>
<p>cable toward unprotected points. This will be made instead of
</p>
<p>movement before mentioned. He will endeavor to assist the repub
</p>
<p>licans in collecting their ballots. Be watchful aud 'assist him. "
</p>
<p>On the very day of the date' of this Richmond despatch Sheridan
</p>
<p>Was attacked, with what success history will declare. The court
</p>
<p>will not fail to notice that the re-election of Mr. Lincoln is to be pre-

</p>
<p>vented if possible,- by any and every means. Nor will they fail
</p>
<p>"to notice that Holcomb is to "explain this"  the same person
</p>
<p>who, in Canada, was the friend and advisor of Alhton, who pro1-
</p>
<p>61
</p>
<p>posed to Davis the assassination, of the " deadliest enemies " of the
</p>
<p>rebellion.. In the despatch of, the 13th of October, which was borne by Mont
</p>
<p>gomery, and transmitted to Richmond in October last, you will find
</p>
<p>these words: "Our friends shall be immediately set to work as
</p>
<p>you direct." Mr. Lincoln ia the. subject of that despatch. Davis is
</p>
<p>therein notified that his, agents in Canada, look upon .the re-election
</p>
<p>of Mr. Lincoln in November as, almost oertain. In this connexion
</p>
<p>he is assured by those agents, that the, friends of their cause are to
</p>
<p>bo set to work as. Davis had directed.. The conversations, which are
</p>
<p>proved by witnesses whose character stands^ unimpeached, disclose
</p>
<p>what "work" the " friends" were. to do under the direction of Davis
</p>
<p>himself. Who were these " friends, " and what was "the work"
</p>
<p>which his agents, Thompson, Clay, Tucker and Sanders had been
</p>
<p>directed to set them at? Let Thompson answer for himself. In a
</p>
<p>conversation with Richard Montgomery in the, summer of 1864,
</p>
<p>Thompson said that "he had his- friends, confederates, all over the
</p>
<p>northern States, who were ready and willing to go any lengths for
</p>
<p>the good of the- cause of the south, and he could at any time haye
</p>
<p>the tyrant Lincoln, or any other of his advisers that he chose, put out
</p>
<p>of his way; ihat they would not consider it a crime, when done for the
</p>
<p>cause of the confederacy.' ' This conversation was repeated by the
</p>
<p>witness in the summer of 1864 to Clement C. Clay, who immediately
</p>
<p>stated : "That is so ; we are all devoted to our cause and ready to go
</p>
<p>any length  to do anything under the sun."
</p>
<p>At and about the time that these declarations of Clay and Thomp^
</p>
<p>son were made, Alston, who made the proposition, as we have seen, to
</p>
<p>Davis, to be furnished with papers to. go north and rid the, confederacy
</p>
<p>of some of its "deadliest enemies," was in Canada. He was doubt
</p>
<p>less one of the "friends" referred to. As appears by the testimony
</p>
<p>of Montgomery, Payne, the prisoner at your bar, was about that time
</p>
<p>in Canada, and was. seen standing by Thompso^' s door, engaged in
</p>
<p>a. conversation with Clay, between whom and the witness some words
</p>
<p>were interchanged, when Clay stated he (Payne) was one of their
</p>
<p>friends "we trupt. him." It is proved beyond a shadow of doubt
</p>
<p>that in October last John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of the President,

</p>
<p>was also in Canada and upon intimate terms with Thompson, Clay,
</p>
<p>Sanders, and other rebel agents. Who can doubt, in the light of the
</p>
<p>events which have since transpired, that he was one of the "friends"
</p>
<p>to be " set to work," as Davis had already directed -not, perhaps, as
</p>
<p>yet to assassinate the President, but to do that other work which is
</p>
<p>62
</p>
<p>suggested in the letter of Oldham, indorsed by Davis in his own
</p>
<p>hand, and spread upon your record  the work of the secret incendiary,
</p>
<p>which was to " fill the people of the north with terror and conster
</p>
<p>nation." The other " work" spoken of by Thompson putting the
</p>
<p>tyrant Lincoln and any of his advisers out of the way, was work doubt
</p>
<p>less to be commenced, only after the re-election of Mr. Lincoln, which
</p>
<p>they had already declared iii their despatch to their employer, Davis,
</p>
<p>was' with them a foregone conclusion. At all events, it was not until
</p>
<p>after the presidential election in November that Alston proposed to
</p>
<p>Davis to go north on the work of assassination ; nor was it until ul&r
</p>
<p>that election that Booth was found in possession of the letter which
</p>
<p>is in evidence, and whfoh discloses the purpose to assassinate the
</p>
<p>President. Being assured, however, when Booth was with them
</p>
<p>in Canada, as they had already declared in their despatch, that the
</p>
<p>re-election of Mr. Lincoln was certain, in which event there would be no
</p>
<p>hope for the confederacy, they doubtless entered into the arrangement
</p>
<p>with Booth as one of their "friends," that as soon as that fact was
</p>
<p>determined he should go "to work," and as soon as might be "rid
</p>
<p>the confederacy of the tyrant Lincoln and of his advisers."
</p>
<p>That these persons named upon your record, Thompson, Sanders,
</p>
<p>Clay, deary, and Tucker, were the agents of Jefferson Davis, is
</p>
<p>another fact established in this case beyond a doubt. They made
</p>
<p>affidavit of it themselves, of record here, upon the examination of
</p>
<p>their "friends," charged with the raid upon St. Albans, before
</p>
<p>Judge Smith, in Canada. It is in evidence also by the letter of Clay;
</p>
<p>before referred to.
</p>
<p>The testimony, to which I have thus briefly referred, shows, by the
</p>
<p>letter of his agents, of the 13th of October, that Davis had before
</p>
<p>directed those agents to set his friends to work. By the letter of
</p>
<p>Clay it seems that his direction had been obeyed, and his friends
</p>
<p>had been set to work, in the burning and robbery and murder at St.
</p>
<p>Albans, in the attempt to burn the city of New York, and in tne
</p>
<p>attempt to introduce pestilence into this capital and into the house of
</p>
<p>the President. It having appeared, by the letter of Alston," and the
</p>
<p>indorsement thereon, that Davis had in November entertained the

<p>proposition of sending agents, that is to say, ' ' friends, ' ' to the north
</p>
<p>to not only "spread terror and consternation among the people" by
</p>
<p>means of his "chemical preparations," but also, in the words of that
</p>
<p>letter, ' ' to strike, ' ' by the hands of assassins, " at the heart' s blood"
</p>
<p>of the deadliest enemies in the north to the confederacy of traitors ;
</p>
<p>63
</p>
<p>it has also appeared by the testimony, of many respectable witnesses,
</p>
<p>among others the attorneys who represented the people of the United
</p>
<p>States and the State of Vermont, in the preliminary trial of the
</p>
<p>.^aiders in Canada, that Clay, Thompson, Tucker, Sanders and Cleary
</p>
<p>declared themselves the agents of the confederacy. It also clearly
</p>
<p>appears by the correspondence referred to, and the letter of Clay,
</p>
<p>that they were holding, and at any time able to command, blank com
</p>
<p>missions from Jefferson Davis to authorize their friends to do what
</p>
<p>ever work they appointed them to .do, in the interests of the rebel
</p>
<p>lion, by the destruction of life and property in the north.
</p>
<p>If a prima facie case justifies, as we have seen by the law of evi
</p>
<p>dence it does,, the introduction of all declarations and acts of any of
</p>
<p>the parties to a conspiracy, uttered or done in the prosecution of the
</p>
<p>common cfosign, as evidence against all the rest, it results, that what
</p>
<p>ever was said or done in furtherance of the common design ,- after this
</p>
<p>month of October, 1864, by either of these agents in Canada, is
</p>
<p>evideflce not only against themselves, but against Davis as well, of
</p>
<p>his complicity with them in the conspiracy..
</p>
<p>Mr. Montgomery testifies that he met Jacob Thompson in January,
</p>
<p>at Montreal, when he said that " a proposition had been made to him
</p>
<p>to rid the world of the tyrant Lincoln, Stanton, Grant; and some others ;
</p>
<p>that he knew the men who had made the proposition were bold,
</p>
<p>daring men, able to execute what they undertook ; that he himself
</p>
<p>was in favor of the proposition, but had determined to defer his
</p>
<p>answer until he had consulted his government, at Richmond ; that he
</p>
<p>was then only awaiting their approval." This was about the middle
</p>
<p>of January, and consequently more than a month after Alston
</p>
<p>had made his proposition direct to- Davis, in writing, to go north
</p>
<p>and rid their confederacy of some of its "deadliest enemies." It was
</p>
<p>at the time of this conversation that Payne, the prisoner, was seen
</p>
<p>by the witness standing at Thompson's doOr in conversation with
</p>
<p>Clay. This witness also shows the intimacy between Thompson,
</p>
<p>Clay, Cleary, Tucker, and Sanders.
</p>
<p>A few days after the assassination of the President, Beverley Tucker
</p>
<p>said to this witness "that President Lincoln deserved his death long

</p>
<p>ago ; that it was a pity he didn't have it long ago, and it was too
</p>
<p>bad that the boys had not been allowed to act when they wanted to."
</p>
<p>This remark undoubtedly had reference to the propositions made
</p>
<p>in the fall to Thompson, and also to Davis, to rid the south of its
</p>
<p>deadliest enemies by their assassination. Cleary, who was accredited
</p>
<p>by Thompson as his confidential agent, also stated to this witness
</p>
<p>64;
</p>
<p>that Booth was one of the party to whom Thompson had referred ini
</p>
<p>the conversation in January, in which he said ha- knew the men who
</p>
<p>were ready to rid the world of the tyrant Lincoln, and of , Stanton and'
</p>
<p>Grant. Cleary also said, speaking of the assassination, "that it was*
</p>
<p>a pity that the whole work had not been done," and added, " they
</p>
<p>had betterJook out  we are not done yet ;" manifestly referring to the-
</p>
<p>statement made by his employer, Thompson, before in the summer,
</p>
<p>that not only the tyrant Lincoln, but Stanton and Grant, and others
</p>
<p>of his advisers, should be put out of the way. Cleary also stated' to
</p>
<p>this witness that Booth had visited Thompson twice in the winter,, the-
</p>
<p>last time in December, and had also been there in the summer.
</p>
<p>Sanford Conover testified that he had been for some time a clerk
</p>
<p>in the war" department at Richmond; that in Canada he knewThomp*
</p>
<p>son, Sanders, Cleary, Tucker, Clay, and other rebel agents ; that he-
</p>
<p>knew John H. Surratt and John Wilkes Booth ; that he saw Booth
</p>
<p>there Upon one occasion, and Surratt upon several successive days-;-
</p>
<p>that he saw Surratt (whom he describes) in April last, in Thompson's
</p>
<p>room, and also in company with Sanders ; that about the 6th or 7th
</p>
<p>of April Surratt delivered to Jacob Thompson a despatch brought
</p>
<p>by him from Benjamin at Richmond, enclosing one in cipher from
</p>
<p>Davis. Thompson had before this proposed to Conover to engage in
</p>
<p>a. plot to assassinate President Lincoln and his cabinet, and on this
</p>
<p>occasion he laid his hand upon these despatches and said, "This
</p>
<p>makes the thing all right," referring to the assent of the rebel au
</p>
<p>thorities, and stated that the rebel authorities had consented to the
</p>
<p>plot to assassinate Lincoln, Johnson, the Secretary of War, Secretary
</p>
<p>of State, Judge Chase, and General Grant. Thompson remarked fur
</p>
<p>ther that the assassination of these parties would leave the govern
</p>
<p>ment of the United States entirely without a head ; that there was
</p>
<p>no provision In the Constitution of the United States by which they
</p>
<p>could elect another President, if these men were put out of the way.
</p>
<p>In speaking of this assassination of the President and others;',-;
</p>
<p>Thompson said that it was only removing them from office, that the
</p>
<p>killing of a tyrant was no murder. It seems that he had learned pre
</p>
<p>cisely the same lesson that Alston had learned in November, when
</p>

</p>
<p>he communicated with Davis, and said, speaking of the President's
</p>
<p>assassination, "he did not think anything dishonorable that would
</p>
<p>serve their cause." Thompson stated at the same time that he had
</p>
<p>conferred a commission on Booth, and that everybody engaged in the:
</p>
<p>enterprise would be commissioned, and if it succeeded, or failed, and
</p>
<p>they escaped into Canada, they could not be reclaimed under the ex-
</p>
<p>65
</p>
<p>tradition treaty. The fact that Thompson and other rebel agents held
</p>
<p>blank commissions, as I have said, has been proved, and a copy of
</p>
<p>one of them is of record here.
</p>
<p>This witness also testifies to a conversation with William C. Cleary,
</p>
<p>shortly after the surrender of Lee's army, and on the day before
</p>
<p>the President's assassination, at the St. Lawrence hotel, Montreal,
</p>
<p>when speaking of the rejoicing in the States over the capture of
</p>
<p>Richmond, Cleary said, "they would put the laugh on the other side
</p>
<p>of their mouth in a day or two." These parties knew that Conover
</p>
<p>was in the secret of the assassination, and talked with him about it
</p>
<p>as. freely as they would speak of the weather. Before the assassina
</p>
<p>tion he had a conversation also with Sanders, who asked him if, he
</p>
<p>knew Booth well, and expressed some apprehension that Booth would
</p>
<p>"make a failure of it; that he was desperate and reckless, and he was
</p>
<p>afraid the whole thing would prove a failure."
</p>
<p>Dr. James D. Merritt testifies that George Young, one of the par
</p>
<p>ties named in the record, declared in his presence, in Canada, last
</p>
<p>fall, that Lincoln should never be inaugurated; that they had friends
</p>
<p>in Washington, who, I suppose, were some of the same friends re
</p>
<p>ferred to in the despatch of October 13, and which Davis had di
</p>
<p>rected them " to set to work." George N. Sanders also said to him
</p>
<p>"that Lincoln would keep himself mighty close if he did serve
</p>
<p>another term;" while Steele and other confederates declared that the
</p>
<p>tyrant never should serve another term. He heard the assassination
</p>
<p>discussed at a meeting of these rebel agents in Montreal in February
</p>
<p>last. " Sanders said they had plenty of money to accomplish the as
</p>
<p>sassination, and named over a number of persons who were ready and
</p>
<p>willing to engage in undertaking to remove the President, Vice
</p>
<p>President, the cabinet, and some of the leading generals. At this
</p>
<p>meeting he read a letter which he had received from Davis, which
</p>
<p>justified him in making any arrangements that he could to accom
</p>
<p>plish the object." This letter the witness heard read, and it, in sub
</p>
<p>stance, declared that if the people in Canada and the southerners in
</p>
<p>the States were willing to submit to be governed by such a tyrant as
</p>
<p>Lincoln, he didn't wish to recognize them as friends. The letter was

</p>
<p>read openly; it was also handed to Colonel Steele, George Young,
</p>
<p>Hill, and Scott, to be read. This was about the middle of February
</p>
<p>last. At this meeting Sanders named over the persons who were
</p>
<p>willing to accomplish the assassination, and among the persons thus
</p>
<p>named was Booth, whom the witness had seen in Canada in October.;.
</p>
<p>5b
</p>
<p>66
</p>
<p>also George Harper, one of the conspirators named on the record,
</p>
<p>Caldwell, Randall, Harrison, and Surratt.
</p>
<p>The witness understood, from the reading of the letter, that if the
</p>
<p>President, Vice-President, and cabinet could be disposed of it would
</p>
<p>satisfy the people of the north that the southerners had friends in
</p>
<p>the north ; that a peace could be obtained on better terms ; that the
</p>
<p>rebels had endeavored to bring about a war between the United
</p>
<p>States and England, and that Mr. Seward, through his energy and
</p>
<p>sagacity, had thwarted all their efforts; that was given as a reason for
</p>
<p>removing him. On the 5th or 6th of last April this witness met
</p>
<p>George Harper, Caldwell, Randall, and others, who are spoken of in
</p>
<p>this meeting at Montreal as engaged to assassinate the President and
</p>
<p>cabinet, when Harper said they were going to the States to make a
</p>
<p>row such as had never been heard of, and added that "if I (the
</p>
<p>witness) did not hear of the death of Old Abe, of the Vice-President,
</p>
<p>and of General Dix in less than ten days, I might put him down as a
</p>
<p>fool. That was on the 6th of April. He mentioned that Booth was
</p>
<p>in Washington at that time. He said they had plenty of friends in
</p>
<p>Washington, and that some fifteen or twenty were going."
</p>
<p>This witness ascertained, on the 8th of April, that Harper and
</p>
<p>others had left for the States. The proof is that these parties could
</p>
<p>come through to Washington from Montreal or Toronto in thirty-six
</p>
<p>hours. They did come, and within the ten days named by Harper
</p>
<p>the President was murdered ! Some attempts have been made to
</p>
<p>discredit this witness, (Dr. Merritt,) not by the examination of wit
</p>
<p>nesses in court, not by any apparent want of truth in the testimony,
</p>
<p>but by the ex pa'rte statements of these rebel agents in Canada and
</p>
<p>their hired advocates in the United States. There is a statement
</p>
<p>upon the record, verified by an official communication from the War
</p>
<p>Department, which shows the truthfulness of this witness, and that
</p>
<p>is, that before the assassination, learning that Harper and his asso
</p>
<p>ciates had started for the States, informed as he was of their purpose j
</p>
<p>to assassinate the President, cabinet, and leading generals, Merritt
</p>
<p>deemed it his duty to call, aud did call, on the 10th of April, upon a
</p>
<p>justice of the peace in Canada, named Davidsoh, and gave him the

</p>
<p>information, that he might take steps to stop these proceedings. The
</p>
<p>correspondence on this subject with Davidson has been brought into
</p>
<p>court. Dr. Merritt testifies, further, that after this meeting in Mon
</p>
<p>treal he had a conversation with Clement C. Clay\ in Toronto, about
</p>
<p>the letter from Jefferson Davis which Sanders had exhibited, in which
</p>
<p>conversation Clay gave the witness to understand that he knew the
</p>
<p>67
</p>
<p>nature of the letter perfectly, and remarked that he thought "the end
</p>
<p>would justify the means." The witness also testifies to the presence
</p>
<p>of Booth with Sanders in Montreal last fall, and of Surratt in Toronto
</p>
<p>in February last.
</p>
<p>The court must be satisfied, by the manner of this and other wit
</p>
<p>nesses to the transactions in Canada, as Well as by the fact that they
</p>
<p>ire wholly uncontradicted in any material matter that they state, that
</p>
<p>they speak the truth, and that the several parties named on your
</p>
<p>record, Davis, Thompson, Cleary, Tucker, Clay, Young, Harper,
</p>
<p>Booth, and John H. Surratt did combine and conspire together in
</p>
<p>Canada to kill and murder Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, Wil
</p>
<p>liam H. Seward, and Utysses S. Grant. That this agreement was
</p>
<p>substantially entered into by Booth and the agents of Davis iri Canada
</p>
<p>as early as October there cannot be any doubt. The language of
</p>
<p>Thompson at that time and before was, that he was in favor of the
</p>
<p>assassination. His further language Was, that he knew the men who
</p>
<p>were ready to do it ; arid Booth, it is shown, was there at that time,
</p>
<p>and, as Thompson's secretary says, was one of the men referred to
</p>
<p>by Thompson.
</p>
<p>The fact that others, besides the parties named on the record, were,
</p>
<p>by the terms of the conspiracy, to be assassinated, in nowise affects
</p>
<p>the case now on trial. If it is true that these parties did conspire to
</p>
<p>murder other parties, as' well as those named upon the record, the
</p>
<p>substance of the charge is proved.
</p>
<p>It is also true that if, in pursuance of that conspiracy, Booth,
</p>
<p>confederated with Surratt and the accused, killed and murdered
</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln, the charge and specification is proved literally as
</p>
<p>stated on your record, although their conspiracy embraced other
</p>
<p>persons. In law the Case stands, though it may appear that the con
</p>
<p>spiracy was to kill and murder the parties named in the record and
</p>
<p>Others not named in the record. If the proof is that the accused,
</p>
<p>with Booth; Surratt, Davis, &c, conspired to kill and murder one or
</p>
<p>more of the persons named, the charge of conspiracy is proved.
</p>
<p>;,< The declaration of Sanders,- as proved, that there was plenty of
</p>
<p>money to carry out this assassination, is very strongly corroborated

</p>
<p>by the testimony of Mr. Campbell, cashier of the Ontario Bank, who
</p>
<p>'states that Thompson, during the current year preceding the assassi
</p>
<p>nation, had upon deposit in the Montreal branch of the Ontario Bank
</p>
<p>six hundred and forty-nine thousand dollars, besides large sums to
</p>
<p>ihis credit in other banks in the province.
</p>
<p>m There is a further corroboration of the testimony of Conover as to
</p>
<p>68
</p>
<p>the meeting of Thompson and Surratt in Montreal, and the delivery
</p>
<p>of the despatches' from Richmond, on the 6th or 7th of April, first,
</p>
<p>in the fact which is shown by the testimony of Chester, that in the
</p>
<p>winter or spring Booth said he himself or some other party must go
</p>
<p>to Richmond, and, second, by the letter of Arnold dated 27th of March
</p>
<p>last, that he preferred Booth's first query, that he would first go. to
</p>
<p>Richmond and see how they would take it, manifestly alluding to the
</p>
<p>proposed -assassination of the President. It does not follow because
</p>
<p>Davis had written a letter in February which, in substance, approved
</p>
<p>the general object, that the parties were fully satisfied with it; be
</p>
<p>cause it is clear there was to be some arrangement made about the
</p>
<p>funds ; and it is also" clear that Davis had not before as distinctly ap
</p>
<p>proved and sanctioned this act as his agents either in Canada or here
</p>
<p>desired. Booth said to Chester, "We must have money ; there is
</p>
<p>money in this business, and if you will enter into it I will place three
</p>
<p>thousand dollars at the disposal of your family; but I have no money
</p>
<p>myself, and must go to Richmond, " or one of the parties must go, ' ' to
</p>
<p>get money to carry out the enterprise." This was one of the arrange
</p>
<p>ments that was to be ' '. made right in Canada." The funds at Thomp,-
</p>
<p>spn's disposal, as the banker testifies, were exclusively raised by drafts
</p>
<p>of the secretary of the treasury of the Confederate States upon Lon
</p>
<p>don, deposited in their bank to the credit of Thompson.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, about the 27th of March, Surratt did go to Richmond.
</p>
<p>On the 3d of April he returned to Washington, and the same day
</p>
<p>left for Canada. ' Before leaving, he stated to Weichmann that when
</p>
<p>in Richmond he had had a conversation with Davis and with Benjamin.,
</p>
<p>The fact in this connexion is not to be overlooked, that on or about
</p>
<p>the day Surratt. arrived in Montreal, April 6, Jacob Thompson, as the
</p>
<p>cashier of the Ontario Bank states, drew of these confederate funds the
</p>
<p>sum of one hundred and eighty thousand dollars in the form of cer
</p>
<p>tificates, which, as the bank officer testifies, "might be used any
</p>
<p>where." What more is wanting? Surely no word further need be spoken
</p>
<p>to show that John Wilkes Booth was in this conspiracy ; that John
</p>
<p>H. Surratt was in this conspiracy ; and that Jefferson Davis and his
</p>
<p>several agents named, in Canada, were in this conspiracy. If any

</p>
<p>additional evidence is wanting to show the complicity of Davis in it,
</p>
<p>let the paper found in the possession of his hired assassin Booth!
</p>
<p>come to bear witness against him. That paper contained tlie secret
</p>
<p>cipher which Davis used in his state department at Richmond,
</p>
<p>which he employed in communicating with his agents in Canada,
</p>
<p>69
</p>
<p>and which they employed in the letter of October 13, notifying
</p>
<p>him that "their friends would be set to work as he had directed."
</p>
<p>The letter in cipher found in Booth's possession is translated here by
</p>
<p>the use of the cipher machine now in court, which, as the testimony
</p>
<p>of Mr. Dana shows, he brought from the rooms of Davis's state de
</p>
<p>partment in Richmond. Who gave Booth this secret cipher ? Of
</p>
<p>what use was it to him if he was not in confederation with Davis?
</p>
<p>But there is one other item of testimony that ought, among honest
</p>
<p>and intelligent people at all conversant with this evidence, to end all
</p>
<p>further inquiry as to whether Jefferson Davis was one of the parties,
</p>
<p>with Booth, as charged upon this record, in the conspiracy to assassi
</p>
<p>nate the President and others. That is, that on the fifth day after the
</p>
<p>assassination, in the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, a telegraphic
</p>
<p>despatch was received by him, at the house of Mr. Bates, from John
</p>
<p>0. Breckinridge, hjs rebel secretary of war, which despatch is pro
</p>
<p>duced here, identified by the telegraph agent, and placed upon your
</p>
<p>record in the words following : "Greensboro', April 19, 1865.
</p>
<p>" His Excellency President Davis :
</p>
<p>' ' President Lincoln was assassinated in the theatre in Washington
</p>
<p>on the night of the 14th inst. Seward' s house was entered on the
</p>
<p>same night and he was repeatedly stabbed, and is probably mortally
</p>
<p>wounded. "JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE."
</p>
<p>At the time this despatch was handed to him, Davis was addressing
</p>
<p>a meeting from the steps of Mr. Bates's' house, and after reading the
</p>
<p>despatch to the people he said: " If it were to be dorie, it were better
</p>
<p>it were well done." Shortly afterwards, in the house of the witness,
</p>
<p>in the same city, Breckinridge, having come to see Davis, stated his
</p>
<p>regret that the occurrence had happened, because he deemed it un
</p>
<p>fortunate for the people of the south at that time. Davis replied, re
</p>
<p>ferring to the assassination, ' ' Well, general, I don't know ; if it were
</p>
<p>to be done at all, it were better that it were well done ; and if the
</p>
<p>same had been done to Andy Johnson, the beast, and to Secretary
</p>
<p>Stanton, the job would then be complete."
</p>
<p>Accomplished as this man was in all the arts of a conspirator, he
</p>
<p>was not equal to tho task as happily, in the good providence of God,

<p>his government or his fellow-men. It was doubtless furthest from
</p>
<p>70
</p>
<p>Jefferson Davis's purpose to make confession, and yet he did make a
</p>
<p>confession. His guilt demanded utterance; that demand he could not
</p>
<p>resist ; therefore his words proclaimed his guilt, in spite of his pur
</p>
<p>pose to conceal it. He said; "if it were to be done, it were better it
</p>
<p>were well done." Would any man ignorant of the conspiracy be
</p>
<p>able to devise and fashion such a form of speech as that ? Had not
</p>
<p>the President been murdered ? Had he not reason to believe that
</p>
<p>the Secretary of State had been mortally wounded ? Yet he was not
</p>
<p>satisfied, but was compelled to say, "it were better it were well
</p>
<p>done"  -that is to say, all that had been agreed to be done'had not
</p>
<p>been done. , Two days afterwards, in his conversation with Breckin
</p>
<p>ridge, he not only repeats the same form of expression, " if it were to
</p>
<p>be done it were better it were well done," but adds these words: "And if
</p>
<p>the same had been done to Andy Johnson, the beast, and to Secretary
</p>
<p>Stanton, the job would then be complete. ' ' He would accept the assassina
</p>
<p>tion of the President, the Vice President, of the Secretary of State and
</p>
<p>the Secretary of War, as a complete execution of the "job," which
</p>
<p>he had given out upon contract, and which he had "made all right,"
</p>
<p>so far as the pay was concerned, by the despatches he had sent to
</p>
<p>Thompson by Surratt, one of his hired assassins. Whatever may
</p>
<p>be tiie conviction of others, my own conviction is that Jefferson
</p>
<p>Davis is as clearly proven guilty of this conspiracy as is John Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth, by whose hand Jefferson Davis inflicted the mortal wound
</p>
<p>upon Abraham Lincoln. His words of intense hate, and rage, and
</p>
<p>disappointment are not to be overlooked  that the assassins had not
</p>
<p>done their work ivell . ; that they had not succeeded in robbing the
</p>
<p>people altogether of their constitutional Executive and his advisers ;
</p>
<p>and hence he exclaims, "If they had killed Andy Johnson, the beast!"
</p>
<p>Neither can he conceal his chagrin and disappointment that the War
</p>
<p>Minister of the republic, whose energy, incorruptible integrity, sleep
</p>
<p>less vigilance, and executive ability had organized day by day, month
</p>
<p>by month, and year by year, victory for our arms, had escaped the
</p>
<p>knife of the hired assassins. The job, says this procurer of assassina
</p>
<p>tion, was not well done ; it had been better if it had been well done 1

<p>Because Abraham Lincoln had been clear in his great office, and had

<p>saved the nation's life by enforcing the nation's laws, this traitor de
</p>
<p>clares he must be murdered; because Mr. Seward, as the foreign sec
</p>
<p>retary of the country, had thwarted the purposes of treason to plunge
</p>
<p>his country into a war with England, he must be murdered; because,
</p>
<p>upon the murder of Mr. Lincoln, Andrew Johnson would succeed to
</p>
<p>the presidency, and because he had been true to the Constitution and
</p>
<p>71
</p>
<p>government,  faithful found among the faithless of his own State,
</p>
<p>clinging to the falling pillars of the republic when others had fled,
</p>
<p>he must be murdered; and because the Secretary of War had taken
</p>
<p>care, by the faithful discharge of his duties, that the republic
</p>
<p>should live and not die, he must be murdered. Inasmuch as these
</p>
<p>two faithful officers were not also assassinated, assuming that the
</p>
<p>Secretary of State was mortally wounded, Davis could riot conceal his
</p>
<p>disappointment and chagrin that the work was not "well done," that
</p>
<p>' ' the job was not complete ! "
</p>
<p>Thus it appears by the testimony that the proposition made to
</p>
<p>Davis, was to kill and murder the deadliest enemies of the confederacy 
</p>
<p>not to kidnap them, as is now pretended here ; that by the declaration
</p>
<p>of Sanders, Tucker, Thompson, Clay, Cleary, Harper and Young, the
</p>
<p>conspirators in Canada, the agreement and combination among them
</p>
<p>was to kill and murder Abraham Lincoln, William H. Seward, Andrew
</p>
<p>Johnson, Ulysses S. Grant, Edwin M, Stanton, and others of his ad
</p>
<p>visors, and not to kidnap them ; it appears from every utterance of
</p>
<p>John Wilkes Booth, as well as from the Charles Selby letter, of which
</p>
<p>mention will presently be made, that, as early as November, the
</p>
<p>proposition with him was to kill arid murder, not to kidnap.
</p>
<p>Since the first examination of Conover, who testified, as the court
</p>
<p>will remember, to many important facts against these conspirators
</p>
<p>and agents of Davis in Canada  among others, the terrible and fiend
</p>
<p>ish plot disclosed by Thompson, Pallen, and others, that they had as
</p>
<p>certained the: volume of water in the reservoir supplying New York
</p>
<p>city, estimated the quantity of poison required to render it deadly,
</p>
<p>and intended thus to poison a whole city  Conover returned to Can
</p>
<p>ada, by direction of this court, for the purpose of obtaining certain
</p>
<p>documentary evidence. There, about the 9th of June, he met Bev
</p>
<p>erley Tucker, Sanders, and other conspirators, and conversed with
</p>
<p>them. Tucker declared that Secretary Stanton; whom he denounced
</p>
<p>as "a scoundrel," and Judge Holt, whom he called " a bloodthirsty
</p>
<p>villain," "could protect themselves as lOng as they remained in
</p>
<p>office by a guard, but that would not always be the case, and, by the
</p>
<p>Eternal, he had a large account to settle with them." After this,

<p>the evidence of Conover here having been published, these parties
</p>
<p>called upon him and asked him whether he had been to Washington,
</p>
<p>and had testified before this court. Conover denied it ; they insisted,
</p>
<p>and took him to a room, where, with drawn pistols, they compelled
</p>
<p>him to consent to make an affidavit that he had been falsely person
</p>
<p>ated here by another, and that he would make, that affidavit before a
</p>
<p>72
</p>
<p>Mr. Kerr, who would witness it. They then called in Mr. Kerr to
</p>
<p>certify to the public that Conover had made such a denial. They
</p>
<p>also compelled this witness to furnish for publication an advertise
</p>
<p>ment offering a reward of five hundred dollars for the arrest of the
</p>
<p>"infamous and perjured scoundrel" who had recently personated
</p>
<p>James W. Wallace under the name of Sanford Conover, and testified
</p>
<p>to a tissue of falsehoods before the inilitary commission at Washing
</p>
<p>ton, which advertisement was published in the papers.
</p>
<p>To these facts Mr. Conoyer now testifies, and also discloses the
</p>
<p>fact that these same men published, in the report of the proceedings
</p>
<p>before Judge Smithy an -affidavit purporting to be his, but which he
</p>
<p>never made. The affidavit which he in fact made, and which was
</p>
<p>published in a newspaper at that time, produced here, is set out sub
</p>
<p>stantially upon your record, and agrees with the testimony upon the
</p>
<p>same point given by him in this court.
</p>
<p>To suppose that Conover ever made such an affidavit voluntarily
</p>
<p>as the one wrung from him as stated is impossible. Would he ad
</p>
<p>vertise for his own arrest and charge himself with falsely personating
</p>
<p>himself? But the fact cannot evade observation, that when these
</p>
<p>guilty conspirators saw Conover' s testimony before this court in the
</p>
<p>public prints, revealing to the world the atrocious plots of these
</p>
<p>felon conspirators, conscious of the truthfulness of his statements,
</p>
<p>they cast about at once for some defence before the public, and de
</p>
<p>vised the foolish and stupid invention of compelling him to make an
</p>
<p>affidavit that he was not Sanford Conover, was not in this court,
</p>
<p>never gave this testimony", but was a practicing lawyer in Montreal!
</p>
<p>This infamous proceeding, eoupled with the evidence before detailed,
</p>
<p>stamps these ruffian plotters with the guilt of this conspiracy.
</p>
<p>John Wilkes Booth having entered into this conspiracy in Canada, ,
</p>
<p>as has been shown, as early as October, he is next found in the city
</p>
<p>of New York on the 11th day, as I claim, of November, in disguise,
</p>
<p>in conversation with another, the conversation disclosing to the wit
</p>
<p>ness, Mrs. Hudspeth, that they had some matter of personal interest
</p>
<p>between them ; that upon one of them the lot had fallen to go
</p>
<p>to Washington  upon the other to go to Newbern. This witnes=,

<p>upon being shown the photograph of Booth, swears "that the face
</p>
<p>is the same" as that of one of those men, who she says was a
</p>
<p>young man of education and culture, as appeared by his conversation,
</p>
<p>and who had a scar like a bite near the jaw-bone. It is a fact proved
</p>
<p>here by the Surgeon General that Booth had such a scar on the side
</p>
<p>of his neck. Mrs . Hudspeth heard him say he would leave for Wash-
</p>
<p>id
</p>
<p>ington the day after to-morrow. His companion appeared angry be
</p>
<p>cause it had not fallen on him to go to Washington. This took place
</p>
<p>after the presidential election in November. She cannot fix the
</p>
<p>precise date, but says she was told that General Butler left New York
</p>
<p>on that day. The testimony discloses that General Butler's army
</p>
<p>was on the llth of November leaving New York. The register of
</p>
<p>the National Hotel shows that Booth left Washington on the early
</p>
<p>morning train, November 11, and that he returned to this city on the
</p>
<p>14th, Chester testifies positively to Booth's presence in New York
</p>
<p>early in November. This testimony shows most conclusively that
</p>
<p>BoQth was ir> New York on the llth of November. The early morn
</p>
<p>ing train on which he left Washington would reach New York early
</p>
<p>in the afternoon of that day. Chester saw him there early in No
</p>
<p>vember, and Mrs. Hudspeth not only identifies his picture, but de
</p>
<p>scribes his person. The scar upon his neck near his jaw was peculiar
</p>
<p>and is well described by the witness as like a bite. On that day
</p>
<p>Booth had a letter in his possession which he accidentally dropped
</p>
<p>in the street car in the presence of Mrs. Hudspeth, the witness, who
</p>
<p>delivered it to Major General Dix the same day, and by whom, as
</p>
<p>his letter on file before this court shows, the same was transmitted
</p>
<p>to the War Department November 17, 1864., That letter contains
</p>
<p>these Words :
</p>
<p>".Dear Louis : The time has at last come that we have all so wished
</p>
<p>for; and upon you everything depends. As it was decided, before
</p>
<p>you left, we were to cast lots, we accordingly, did so, and you are to
</p>
<p>be the Charlotte Corday of the 19th century. When you remember
</p>
<p>the fearful, solemn vow that was taken by us, you will feel there is no
</p>
<p>drawback. Abe must die, and now. You can choose your weapons 
</p>
<p>th cup, the knife, the bullet. The cup failed us once, and might again.
</p>
<p>Johnson, who will give this, has been like an-enraged demon since the
</p>
<p>meeting, because it has not fallen upon him to rid the world of the
</p>
<p>monster. * * * You know where to find your friends. Your
</p>
<p>disguises are so perfect and complete that without one knew your
</p>
<p>face, no police telegraphic despatch would catch you. The English

</p>
<p>The learned gentleman, (Mr. Cox,) in his very able and care
</p>
<p>fully considered argument in defence of O'Laughlin and Arnold, at
</p>
<p>tached importance to this letter, and doubtless very clearly saw its
</p>
<p>bearing upon the case, and therefore undertook to show that the wit
</p>
<p>ness, Mrs. Hudspeth, must be mistaken as to the person of Booth.
</p>
<p>The gentleman assumes that the letter of General Dix, of the 17th
</p>
<p>of November last, transmitting this letter to the War Department,
</p>
<p>reads that the party who dropped the letter was heard to say that he
</p>
<p>would start to Washington on Friday night next, although the word
</p>
<p>' ' next ' ' is not in the letter, neither is it in the quotation which the
</p>
<p>gentleman makes, for he quotes it fairly; yet he concludes that this
</p>
<p>would be the 18th of November.
</p>
<p>Now the fact is, the llth of November last was Friday, and the
</p>
<p>register of the National Hotel bears witness that Mrs. Hudspeth is not
</p>
<p>mistaken; because her language is, that Booth said he would leave for
</p>
<p>Washington day after to-morrow, which would be Sunday, the 13th,
</p>
<p>and if in the evening, would bring him to Washington on Monday, the
</p>
<p>14th of November, the day on which, the register shows, he did re
</p>
<p>turn to the National Hotel. As to the improbability which the gen
</p>
<p>tleman raises, ou the conversation happening in a street car, crowded
</p>
<p>with people, there was nothing that transpired, although the conver
</p>
<p>sation was earnest, which enabled the witness, or could have enabled
</p>
<p>any one, in the absence of this letter, or of the subsequent conduct
</p>
<p>of Booth, to form the least idea of the subject-matter of their conver
</p>
<p>sation. The gentlemandoes not deal altogether fairly in his remarks
</p>
<p>touching the letter of General Dix; because, upon a careful examina
</p>
<p>tion of the letter, it will be found that he did not form any such judg
</p>
<p>ment as that it was a hoax for the Sunday Mercury, but he took care
</p>
<p>to forward it to the Department, and asked attention to it; when, as
</p>
<p>appears by the testimony of the Assistant Secretary of War, Mr.
</p>
<p>Dana, the letter was delivered to Mr. Lincoln, who considered it im-
</p>
<p>portarit enough to indorse it with the word "Assassination," and file
</p>
<p>it in his office, where it was found after the commission of this crime,
</p>
<p>and brought, into this court to bear witness against his assassins.
</p>
<p>Although this letter would imply that the assassination spoken of

</p>
<p>was to take place speedily, yet the party was to bide his time. Though
</p>
<p>he had entered into the preliminary arrangements in Canada, al
</p>
<p>though conspirators had doubtless agreed to co-operate with him in
</p>
<p>the commission of the crime, and lots had been cast for the chief part in
</p>
<p>the bloody drama, yet it remained for him, as the leader and principal
</p>
<p>of the hired assassins, by whose hand their employers were to strike
</p>
<p>75
</p>
<p>the murderous blow, to collect about him and bring to Washington
</p>
<p>such persons as would be willing to lend themselves for a price to
</p>
<p>the horrid crime and likely to give the necessary aid and support in
</p>
<p>its consummation. The letter declares that Abraham Lincoln must die,
</p>
<p>and now, meaning as soon as the agents can be employed and the
</p>
<p>work done. To that end you will bide your time. But, says the gen
</p>
<p>tleman, it could not have been the same conspiracy charged here to
</p>
<p>which this letter refers. Why not? It is charged here that Booth
</p>
<p>with the accused and others conspired to kill and murder Abraham
</p>
<p>Lincoln  that is precisely the conspiracy disclosed in the letter.
</p>
<p>Granted that the parties on trial had not then entered into the com
</p>
<p>bination; if they at any time afterward entered into it they became
</p>
<p>parties to it, and the conspiracy was still the same. But, says the gen
</p>
<p>tleman, the words of the letter imply that the conspiracy was to be
</p>
<p>executed within the fortnight. Booth is directed, by the name of
</p>
<p>Louis, to meet the writer within the fortnight. It by no means follows
</p>
<p>that he was to strike within the fortnight, because he was to meet
</p>
<p>his co-conspirator, within that time, and any such conclusion is ex
</p>
<p>cluded by the words ' ' Bide your time." Even if the conspiracy was to
</p>
<p>be executed within the fortnight, and was not so executed, and the
</p>
<p>same party, Booth, afterwards by concert and agreement with the ac
</p>
<p>cused and others did execute it by " striking sure " and killing the
</p>
<p>President, that act, whenever done, would be but the execution of the
</p>
<p>same conspiracy. The letter is conclusive evidence of so much of this
</p>
<p>conspiracy as relates to the murder of President Lincoln. As Booth
</p>
<p>was to do anything but fail, he immediately thereafter sought out
</p>
<p>the agents to enable him to strike sure, and execute all that he had
</p>
<p>agreed With Davis and his co-confederates in Canada to do  to mur
</p>
<p>der the President, the Secretary of State, the Vice President, Gen
</p>
<p>eral Grant, and Secretary Stanton.
</p>
<p>Even Booth' s co-conspirator, Payne, now on his trial, by his defence
</p>
<p>admits all this, and says Booth had just been to Canada, ' ' was filled
</p>
<p>with a mighty scheme, and was lying in wait for agents." Booth
</p>
<p>asked the co-operation of the prisoner Payne, and said : "I will give
</p>
<p>you as much money as you want; but first. you must swear to stick

</p>
<p>by me.. It is in the oil business." This you are told by %he accused
</p>
<p>was early in March last. Thus guilt bears witness against itself.
</p>
<p>We find Booth in New York in November, December, and January,
</p>
<p>urging Chester to enter into this combination, assuring him that there
</p>
<p>was money in it; that they had "friends on the other side;" that if
</p>
<p>he would only participate in it he would never want for money while
</p>
<p>76
</p>
<p>he lived, and all that was asked of him was to stand at and open the
</p>
<p>backdoor of Ford' s theatre. Booth, in his interviews with Chester,
</p>
<p>confesses that lie is without money himself, and allows Chester to re
</p>
<p>imburse him the $50 which he (Booth) had transmitted to him in a letter
</p>
<p>for the purpose of paying his expenses to Washington as one of the
</p>
<p>parties to this conspiracy. Booth told him, although he himself was
</p>
<p>penniless, ' ' there is money in this  we have friends on the other side ;' '
</p>
<p>and if you will but engage, I will have three thousand dollars de
</p>
<p>posited at once for the use of your family.
</p>
<p>Failing to secure the services of Chester, because his soul recoiled
</p>
<p>with abhorrence from the foul work of assassination and murder, he
</p>
<p>found more willing instruments in others whom he gathered about
</p>
<p>him. Men to commit the assassinations, horses to secure speedy
</p>
<p>and certain escape, were to be provided, and to this end Booth,
</p>
<p>with an energy worthy of a better cause, applies himself. For this
</p>
<p>latter purpose he told Chester he had already expended $5,000. In
</p>
<p>the latter part of November, 1864, he visits Charles county, Mary
</p>
<p>land, and is in company with one of the prisoners, Dr. Samuel A.
</p>
<p>Mudd, with whom he lodged over night, and through whom he pro
</p>
<p>cures of Gardner one of the several horses which were at his dis
</p>
<p>posal, and used by him and his co-conspirators in Washington on the
</p>
<p>night of the assassination.
</p>
<p>Some time in January last, it is in testimony, that the prisoner
</p>
<p>Mudd introduced Booth to John H. Surratt and the witness Weich-
</p>
<p>mann ; that Booth invited them to the National Hotel ; that when
</p>
<p>there, in the room to which Booth took them, Mudd went out into the
</p>
<p>passage, called Booth out and had a private conversation with him,
</p>
<p>leaving the witness and Surratt in the room. Upon their return to
</p>
<p>the room Booth went out with Surratt, and upon their coming in all
</p>
<p>three, Booth, Surratt, and Samuel A. Mudd, went out together and
</p>
<p>had a conversatiori in the passage, leaving the witness alone. Up to
</p>
<p>the time of this interview it seems that neither the witness nor Sur
</p>
<p>ratt had any knowledge of Booth, as they were then introduced to
</p>
<p>him by Dr. Mudd. Whether Surratt had in fact previously known
</p>
<p>Booth it is not important to inquire. Mudd deemed it necessary,

</p>
<p>perhaps a wise precaution, to introduce Surratt to Booth ; he also
</p>
<p>deemed it necessary to have a private conversation with Booth shortly
</p>
<p>afterwards, and directly Upon that to have a conversation together
</p>
<p>with Booth and Surratt alone. Had this conversation, no part ot
</p>
<p>which was heard by the witness, been perfectly innocent, it is not to
</p>
<p>be presumed that Dr. Mudd, who was an entire stranger to Weich-
</p>
<p>77
</p>
<p>mann, would have deemed it necessary to hold the conversation se
</p>
<p>cretly, nor to have volunteered to tell the witness, or rather pre
</p>
<p>tend to tell him, what the conversation was ; yet he did say to the
</p>
<p>witness, upon their return to the room, by way of apology, I suppose,
</p>
<p>for the privacy of the conversation, that Booth had some private
</p>
<p>business with him; and wished to purchase his farm. This silly de
</p>
<p>vice, as is often the case in attempts at deception, failed in the exe
</p>
<p>cution ; for it remains to be shown how the fact that Mudd had pri
</p>
<p>vate business with Booth, and that Booth wished to purchase his
</p>
<p>farm, made it at all necessary or even proper that they should both
</p>
<p>volunteer to call out Surratt, who up to that moment was a stranger
</p>
<p>to Booth. What had Surratt to do with Booth's purchase of Mudd's
</p>
<p>farm? And if it was necessary to withdraw and talk by theihselves
</p>
<p>secretly about the sale of the farm, why should they disclose the fact
</p>
<p>to the very man from whom they had concealed it ?
</p>
<p>Upon the return of these three parties to the room, they seated
</p>
<p>themselves at a table, and upon the back of an envelope Booth traced

<p>lines with a pencil, indicating, as the witness states, the direction of
</p>
<p>roads. Why was this done ? As Booth had been previously in that
</p>
<p>section of country, as the prisoner in his defence has taken great
</p>
<p>pains to show, it was certainly not necessary to anything connected
</p>
<p>with the purchase of Mudd' s farm that at that time he should be
</p>
<p>indicating the direction of roads to or from it; nor is it made to ap
</p>
<p>pear, by anything in this testimony, how it comes that Surratt, as the
</p>
<p>witness testifies, seemed to be as much interested in the marking out
</p>
<p>of these roads as Mudd or Booth. It does not appear that Surratt
</p>
<p>was in anywise connected with or interested in the sale of Mudd s
</p>
<p>farm. From all that has transpired since this meeting at the hotel,
</p>
<p>it would seem that this plotting the roads was intended, not so much
</p>
<p>to show the road to Mudd's farm, as to point out the shortest and
</p>
<p>safest route for flight from the capital, by the houses of all the parties
</p>
<p>to this conspiracy, to their "friends on the other side."
</p>
<p>But, says the learned gentleman, (Mr. Ewing,) in his very able argu
</p>
<p>ment in defence of this prisoner, why should Booth determine that
</p>
<p>his flight should be through Charles county ? The answer must be

<p>obvious, upon a moment's reflection, to every man, and could not
</p>
<p>possibly have escaped the notice of the counsel himself, but for the
</p>
<p>reason that his zeal for his client constrained him to overlook it. It
</p>
<p>was absolutely essential that this murderer should have his co-conspira
</p>
<p>tors at convenient points along his route, and it does not appear in
</p>
<p>evidence that by the route to his friends, who had then fled from
</p>
<p>78
</p>
<p>Richmond, which the gentleman (Mr. Ewing) indicates as the more
</p>
<p>direct, but of which there is not the slightest evidence whatever,
</p>
<p>Booth had co-conspirators at an equal distance from Washington.
</p>
<p>The testimony discloses, further, that on the route selected by him
</p>
<p>for his flight there is a large population that would be most likely to
</p>
<p>favor and aid him in the execution of his wicked purpose, and in
</p>
<p>making his escape. But it is a sufficient answer to the gentleman's
</p>
<p>question, that Booth' s co-conspirator Mudd lived in Charles county.
</p>
<p>To return to the meeting at the hotel. In the light of other facts
</p>
<p>in this case, it must become clear to the court that this secret meet
</p>
<p>ing between Booth, Surratt, and Mudd was a conference looking to
</p>
<p>the execution of this conspiracy. It so impressed the prisoner  it so
</p>
<p>impressed his counsel, that they deemed it necessary and absolutely
</p>
<p>essential to their defence to attempt to destroy the credibility of the
</p>
<p>witness Weichmann.
</p>
<p>I may say here, in passing, that they have not attempted to impeach
</p>
<p>his general reputation for truth by the testimony of a single witness,
</p>
<p>nor have they impeached his testimony by calling a single witness to
</p>
<p>discredit one material fact to which he has testified in this issue.
</p>
<p>Failing to find a breath of suspicion against Weichmann' s character,
</p>
<p>or to contradict a single fact to which he testified, the accused had to
</p>
<p>fly to the last resort, an alibi, and very earnestly did the learned
</p>
<p>counsel devote himself to the task.
</p>
<p>It is not material whether this meeting in the hotel took place on
</p>
<p>the 23d of December or in January. But, says the counsel, it was
</p>
<p>after the commencement or close of the Congressional holiday. That
</p>
<p>is not material ; but the concurrent resolution of Congress shows
</p>
<p>that the holiday commenced on the 22d December, the day before
</p>
<p>the accused spent the evening in Washington. The witness is not
</p>
<p>certain about the date of this meeting. The material fact is, did this
</p>
<p>meeting take place  either on the 23d of December or in January last?
</p>
<p>Were the private interviews there held, and was the apology made,
</p>
<p>as detailed, by Mudd and Booth, after the secret conference, to the
</p>
<p>witness? That the meeting did take place, and that Mudd did ex
</p>
<p>plain that these secret interviews, with Booth first, and with Booth

</p>
<p>and Surratt directly afterward, had relation to the sale of his farm,
</p>
<p>is confessedly admitted by the endeavor of the prisoner, through his
</p>
<p>counsel, to show that negotiations had been going on between Booth
</p>
<p>and Mudd for the sale of Mudd's farm. If no such meeting was held,
</p>
<p>if no such explanation was made by Mudd to Weichmann, can any
</p>
<p>man for a moment believe that a witness would have been called here
</p>
<p>79
</p>
<p>to give any testimony about Booth having negotiated for Mudd' s farm ?
</p>
<p>What conceivable connexion has it with this case, except to show
</p>
<p>that Mudd's explanation to Weichmann for his extraordinary conduct
</p>
<p>was in exact accordance with the fact ? Or was this testimony about
</p>
<p>the negotiations for Mudd's farm intended to show so close an inti
</p>
<p>macy and intercourse with Booth that Mudd could not fail to recog
</p>
<p>nize him when he came flying for aid to his house from the work of
</p>
<p>assassination ? It would be injustice to the able counsel to suppose
</p>
<p>that.
</p>
<p>. I have said that it was wholly immaterial whether this conversa
</p>
<p>tion took place on the 23d of December or in January ; it is in evi
</p>
<p>dence that in both those months Booth was at the National Hotel ;
</p>
<p>that he occupied a room there ; that he arrived there on the 22d
</p>
<p>and was' there on the 23,d of December last, and also on the 12th day
</p>
<p>of January. The testimony of the witness is, that Booth said
</p>
<p>he had just come in. Suppose this conversation took place in
</p>
<p>December, on the evening of the 23d, the time when it is proved by
</p>
<p>J. T. Mudd, the witness for the accused, that he, in company with
</p>
<p>Samuel A. Mudd, spent the night in Washington city. Is there any
</p>
<p>thing in the testimony of that or any other witness to show that the
</p>
<p>accused did not have and could not have had an interview with Booth
</p>
<p>on that evening ? J. T. Mudd testifies that he separated from the
</p>
<p>prisoner, Samuel A. Mudd, at the National Hotel early in the evening
</p>
<p>of that day, and did not meet him again until the accused came in for
</p>
<p>the night at the Pennsylvania House, where he stopped. Where was
</p>
<p>Dr. Samuel A. Mudd during this interval ? Whatdoes his witness know
</p>
<p>about him during that time ? How can he say that Dr. Mudd did not
</p>
<p>go up on Seventh street in company with Booth, then at the National;
</p>
<p>that he did not on Seventh street meet Surratt and Weichmann ; that
</p>
<p>he did not return to the National Hotel ; that he did not have this in
</p>
<p>terview, and afterwards meet him, the witness, as he testifies, at the
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania House ? Who knows that the Congressional holiday
</p>
<p>had not in fact. commenced on that day? What witness has been
</p>
<p>called to prove that Booth did not on either of those occasions occupy
</p>
<p>the room that had formerly been occupied by a member of Congress,

</p>
<p>who had temporarily vacated it, leaving his books there ? Weich
</p>
<p>mann, I repeat, is not positive as to the date, he is only positive as
</p>
<p>to the fact ; and he disclosed voluntarily, to this court, that the date
</p>
<p>could probably be fixed by a reference to the register of the Penn
</p>
<p>sylvania House ; that register cannot, of course, be conclusive of
</p>
<p>whether Mudd was there in January or not, for the very good reason
</p>
<p>80
</p>
<p>that the proprietor admits that he did not know Samuel A. Mudd,
</p>
<p>therefore Mudd might have registered by any other name. Weich
</p>
<p>mann does not pretend to know that Mudd had registered at all.
</p>
<p>If Mudd was here in January, as a party to this conspiracy,
</p>
<p>it is not at all unlikely that, if he did register at that time
</p>
<p>in the presence of a man to whom he was wholly unknown,
</p>
<p>his kinsman not then being with him, he would register by a false
</p>
<p>name. But if the interview took place in December, the testimony
</p>
<p>of Weichmann bears as strongly against the accused as if it had hap
</p>
<p>pened in January. Weichmann says he does not know what time was
</p>
<p>occupied in this interview at the National Hotel; that it probably
</p>
<p>lasted twenty minutes; that, after the private interviews between
</p>
<p>Mudd and Surratt and Booth, which were not of very long duration, had
</p>
<p>terminated, the parties went to the Pennsylvania House, where Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd had rooms, and after sitting together in the common sitting-
</p>
<p>room of the hotel, they left Dr. Mudd there about 10 o'clock p. m.r
</p>
<p>who remained during the night. Weichmann' s testimony leaves
</p>
<p>no doubt that this meeting on Seventh street and interview at the
</p>
<p>National took place after dark, and terminated before or about 10
</p>
<p>o'clock p. m. His own witness, J. T.^Mudd, after stating that he
</p>
<p>separated from the accused at the National Hotel, says after he had
</p>
<p>got through a conversation with a gentleman of his acquaintance, he
</p>
<p>walked, down the Avenue, went to several clothing stores, and "after
</p>
<p>a while" walked round to the Pennsylvania House, and "very soOn
</p>
<p>after" he got there Dr. Mudd came in, and they went to bed
</p>
<p>shortly afterwards. What time he spent in his "walk alone" on the
</p>
<p>Avenue, looking at clothing; what period he embraces in the terms
</p>
<p>' ' after a while, ' ' when he returned to the Pennsylvania House, and
</p>
<p>"soon after" Which Dr. Mudd got there, the witness does not
</p>
<p>disclose. Neither does be intimate, much less testify, that he saw
</p>
<p>Dr. Mudd when he first entered the Pennsylvania House on
</p>
<p>that night after their separation. How does he know that Booth and
</p>
<p>Surrat and Weichmann did not accompany Samuel A. Mudd to that
</p>
<p>house that evening? How does he know that the prisoner and
</p>
<p>those persons did not converse together some time in the sitting-

<p>room of the Pennsylvania Hotel ? Jeremiah Mudd has not testified
</p>
<p>that he met Doctor Mudd in that room, or that he was in it him
</p>
<p>self. He has, however, sworn to the fact, which is disproved by no
</p>
<p>one, that the prisoner was separated from him long enough that
</p>
<p>evening to have had the meeting with Booth, Surratt, and Weich
</p>
<p>mann, and the interviews in the National Hotel, and at the Pennsyl-
</p>
<p>81
</p>
<p>vania House, to wnich Weichmann has testified ? Who is there to
</p>
<p>disprove it ? Of what importance is it whether it was on the 23d day
</p>
<p>of December or in January* How does that affect the credibility of
</p>
<p>Weichmann? He is a man, as I have before said, against whose
</p>
<p>reputation for truth and good conduct they have not been able to
</p>
<p>bring one witness. If this meeting did by possibility take place that
</p>
<p>night, is there anything to render it improbable that Booth, and Mudd,
</p>
<p>and Surratt did have the conversation at the National Hotel to. which
</p>
<p>Weichmann testifies ? Of what avail, therefore, is the attempt to
</p>
<p>prove that Mudd was not here during January, if it was clear that he
</p>
<p>was here on the 23d of. December, 1864, and had this conversation
</p>
<p>with Booth ? That this attempt to prove an alibi during January has
</p>
<p>failed, is quite as clear as is the proof of the fact that the prisoner
</p>
<p>was here on the evening of the 23d of December, and present in the
</p>
<p>National Hotel, where Booth stopped. The fact that the prisoner,
</p>
<p>Samuel A. Mudd, went with J. T. Mudd on that evening to the Na
</p>
<p>tional Hotel, and there separated from him, is proved by his own
</p>
<p>witness, J. T. Mudd; and that he did not rejoin him until they retired
</p>
<p>to bed in the Pennsylvania House is proved by the same witness, and
</p>
<p>contradicted by nobody. Does any one suppose there would have
</p>
<p>been such assiduous care to prove that the prisoner was with his
</p>
<p>kinsman all the time on the 23d of December in Washington, if they
</p>
<p>had not known that Booth was then at the National Hotel, and that a
</p>
<p>meeting of the prisoner with Booth, Surratt, and Weichmann on that
</p>
<p>day would corroborate and confirm Weichmann' s testimony in every
</p>
<p>material statement he made concerning that meeting ?
</p>
<p>The accused having signally failed to account for his absence after
</p>
<p>he separated from his witness, J. T. Mudd, early in the evening of
</p>
<p>the 23d of December, at the National Hotel, until they had again
</p>
<p>met at the Pennsylvania House, when they retired to rest, he now
</p>
<p>attempts to prove an alibi as to the month of January. In this he
</p>
<p>has failed, as he failed in the attempt to show that he could not
</p>
<p>have met Booth, Surratt, and Weichmann on the 23d of December.
</p>
<p>For this purpose the accused calls Betty Washington. She had

<p>last, except when here at court, and says that the prisoner, Mudd,
</p>
<p>has only been away from home three nights during that time. This
</p>
<p>witness forgets that Mudd has not been at home any night or day .
</p>
<p>since this court assembled. Neither does she account for the three
</p>
<p>nights in which she swears to his absence from home. First, she
</p>
<p>6b
</p>
<p>82
</p>
<p>says he went to Gardner' s party ; second, he went to Giesbbro;
</p>
<p>then to Washington. She does not know in what month he was
</p>
<p>away, the second time, all night. She cmly knows where he went,
</p>
<p>from what he and his wife said, which is not evidence; but she does
</p>
<p>testify that when he left home and was absent over night, the second
</p>
<p>time, it was about two or three weeks after she came to his house,
</p>
<p>which would, if it were three weeks, make it just about the 15th of
</p>
<p>January, 1865; because she swears she came to his house on the first
</p>
<p>Monday after Christmas last, which was the 26th day of December;
</p>
<p>so that the 15th of January would be three weeks, less one day, from
</p>
<p>that time; and it might have been a week earlier according to her
</p>
<p>testimony, as, also, it might have been a week earlier, or more, by
</p>
<p>Weichmann' s testimony, for he is not positiye as to the time. What
</p>
<p>I have said of the register of the Pennsylvania House, the headquar
</p>
<p>ters of Mudd and Atzerodt, I need not here repeat. That record
</p>
<p>proves nothing, save that Dr. Mudd was there on the 23d of Decem
</p>
<p>ber, which, as we have seen, is a fact, along with others, to show
</p>
<p>that the meeting at the National then took place. I have also called
</p>
<p>the attentibn of the court to the fact that if Mudd waB at that house
</p>
<p>again in January, and did not register his name, that fact proves
</p>
<p>nothing; or, if he did, the register only proves that he registered
</p>
<p>falsely; either of which facts might have happened without the
</p>
<p>knowledge of the witness called by the accused from that house, who
</p>
<p>does not know Samuel A. Mudd personally.
</p>
<p>The testimony of Henry L. Mudd, his brother, in support of this
</p>
<p>alibi, is, that the prisoner was in Washington on the 23d of March.
</p>
<p>and on the 10th of April, four days before the murder I But he does
</p>
<p>not account for the absent night in January, about -which Betty
</p>
<p>Washington testifies. Thomas Davis was called for the same pur
</p>
<p>pose, but stated that he was himself absent one night in January,
</p>
<p>after the 9th of that month, and he could not say whether Mudd was
</p>
<p>there on that night or not. He does testify to Mudd's absence over
</p>
<p>night three times, and fixes one occasion on the night of the 26th of
</p>
<p>January. In consequence of his own absence one night in January,
</p>
<p>this witness cannot account for the absence of Mudd on the night

<p>referred to by Betty Washington.
</p>
<p>This matter is entitled to no further attention. It can satisfy no
</p>
<p>one, and the burden of proof is upon the prisoner to prove that he
</p>
<p>was not in Washington in January last. How can such testimony
</p>
<p>convince any rational man that Mudd was not here in January, against
</p>
<p>the evidence of an unimpeached witness, who swears that Samuel A.
</p>
<p>83
</p>
<p>Mudd was in Washington in the month of January? Who that haa
</p>
<p>been examined here as a witness knows that he was not ?
</p>
<p>- The Rev. Mr. Evans swears that he saw him in Washington last
</p>
<p>winter, and that at the same time he saw Jarboe, the one coming out
</p>
<p>of, and the other going into, a house on H street, which he was in
</p>
<p>formed on inquiry was the house of Mrs. Surratt. Jarboe is the
</p>
<p>only witness called to contradict Mr. Evans, and he leaves it in extreme
</p>
<p>doubt whether he does not corroborate him, as he swears that he was
</p>
<p>here, himself last winter or fall, but cannot state exactly the time.
</p>
<p>Jarboe' s silence on questions touching his own credibility leaves no
</p>
<p>room for any one to say that his testimony could impeach Mr. Evans,
</p>
<p>whatever he might swear.
</p>
<p>Miss Anna H. Surratt is also called for the purpose of impeaching
</p>
<p>Mr. Evans. It is, sufficient to say of her testimony on that point that
</p>
<p>she swears negatively orily  that she did not see either of the persons
</p>
<p>named at her mother's house. This testimony neither disproves, nor
</p>
<p>does it even tend to disprove, the fact put in issue by Mr. Evans. No
</p>
<p>one will pretend, whatever the form of her expression in giving her
</p>
<p>testimony, that she could say more than that she did not know the
</p>
<p>fact, as it was impossible that she could know who was, or who was
</p>
<p>not, at her mother's house, casually, at a period so remote. It is not
</p>
<p>my purpose, neither is it needful here, to question in any way the
</p>
<p>integrity of this young woman.
</p>
<p>r It is further in testimony that Samuel A. Mudd was here on the 3d
</p>
<p>day of March last, the day preceding the inauguration, when Booth
</p>
<p>was to strike the traitorous blow ; and it was, doubtless, only
</p>
<p>by the interposition of that God who stands within the shadow
</p>
<p>and keeps watch above his own, that the victim of. this conspiracy
</p>
<p>was spared that day from the assassin's hand that he might complete
</p>
<p>his work and see the salvation of his country in the fall of Richmond
</p>
<p>and the surrender of its great army. Dr. Mudd was here on that
</p>
<p>day (the 3d of March) to abet, to encourage* to nerve his co-conspira
</p>
<p>tor for the commission of this great crime. He was carried away by
</p>
<p>the awful purpose which possessed him, and rushed into the room of
</p>
<p>Mr. Norton at the National Hotel in search of Booth, exclaiming ex

</p>
<p>citedly: "I'm mistaken; I thought this was Mr. Booth's room." He
</p>
<p>is told Mr. Booth is above, on the next floor. He is followed by Mr.
</p>
<p>Norton, because of his rude and excited behavior, and being fol
</p>
<p>lowed, conscious of his guilty errand, ha turns away, afraid, of him
</p>
<p>self and afraid to be found in concert with, his fellow confederate.
</p>
<p> 84
</p>
<p>Mr. Norton identifies the prisoner, and has no doubt that Samuel A.
</p>
<p>Mudd is the man.
</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Evans also swears that, after the 1st and before
</p>
<p>the 4th day of March last, he is certain that within that time, and on
</p>
<p>the 2d or 3d of March, he saw Dr. Mudd drive into Washington city.
</p>
<p>The endeavor is made by the accused, in order to break down this
</p>
<p>witness, by proving another alibi. The sister of the accused, Miss
</p>
<p>Fanny Mudd, is called. She testifies that she saw the prisoner at
</p>
<p>breakfast in her father's house, on the 2d of March, about 5 o'clock
</p>
<p>in the morning, and not again until the 3d of March at noon. Mrs.
</p>
<p>Emily Mudd swears substantially to the same statement. Betty
</p>
<p>Washington, called for the accused, swears that he was at home all
</p>
<p>day at work with her on the 2d of March, arid took breakfast at home.
</p>
<p>Frank Washington swears that Mudd was at home all day ; that he
</p>
<p>saw him when he first came out in the morning about sunrise from 
</p>
<p>his own house, and knows that he was there all day with them.
</p>
<p>Which is correct, the testimony of his sisters or the testimony of
</p>
<p>his servants ? The sisters say that he was at their father' s house fof
</p>
<p>breakfast on the morning of the 2d of March ; the servants say he
</p>
<p>Was at home for breakfast with them on that day. If this testimony
</p>
<p>is followed, it proves one alibi too much. It is impossible, in the
</p>
<p>nature of things, that the testimony of all these four witnesses can
</p>
<p>be true.
</p>
<p>Seeing this weakness in the testimony brought to prove this second
</p>
<p>alibi, the endeavor is next made to discredit Mr. Norton for truth ;
</p>
<p>and two witnesses, not more, are called, who testify that his reputa
</p>
<p>tion for truth has suffered by contested litigation between one of the
</p>
<p>impeaching witnesses and others. Four witnesses are called, who
</p>
<p>testify that Mr. Norton's reputation for truth is Very good ; that he
</p>
<p>is a man of high character for truth, and entitled to be believed
</p>
<p>whether he speaks under the obligation of an oath or not. The late
</p>
<p>Postmaster General, Hon. Horatio King, not only sustains Mr. Nor
</p>
<p>ton as a man of good reputation for truth, but expressly corroborates
</p>
<p>his testimony, by stating that in March last, about the 4th of March,
</p>

<p>man came into his room under excitement, alarmed his sister, was
</p>
<p>followed out by himself, and Went down stairs instead of going up ;
</p>
<p>and that Mr. Norton told him this before the assassination, and about
</p>
<p>the time of the inauguration. What motive had Mr. Norton at that
</p>
<p>time to fabricate this statement ? It detracts nothing from his testi
</p>
<p>mony that he did not at that time mention the name of this man to
</p>
<p>85
</p>
<p>his friend, Mr. King ; because it appears from his testimony and
</p>
<p>there is none to question the truthfulness of his statement that at
</p>
<p>that time he did not know his name. Neither does it take from the
</p>
<p>force of this testimony, that Mr. Norton did not, in communicating
</p>
<p>this matter to Mr. King, make mention of Booth's name ; because
</p>
<p>there was nothing in the transaction, at the time, he being ignorant
</p>
<p>of the name of Mudd, and equally ignorant of the conspiracy between
</p>
<p>Mudd and Booth, to give the least occasion for any mention of Booth
</p>
<p>or of the transaction further than as he detailed it. With such cor
</p>
<p>roboration, who can doubt the fact that. Mudd did enter the room of
</p>
<p>Mr. Norton, and was followed by him, on the 3d of March last? Can
</p>
<p>he be mistaken in the man? Whoever looks at the prisoner care
</p>
<p>fully once will be sure to recognize him again.
</p>
<p>For the present I pass, from the consideration of the testimony
</p>
<p>showing Dr. Mudd's connection with Booth in this conspiracy, with
</p>
<p>the remark that it is in evidence, and I think established, both by the
</p>
<p>testimony adduced by the prosecution and that by the prisoner,
</p>
<p>that since the commencement of this rebellion John H. Surratt vis
</p>
<p>ited the- prisoner's house ; that he concealed Surratt and other rebels
</p>
<p>and traitors in the woods near his house, where for several days he
</p>
<p>furnished them with food and bedding; that the shelter of the woods
</p>
<p>by night and by day was the only shelter that the prisoner dare furnish
</p>
<p>these fr(ends of his; that in November Booth visited him and remained
</p>
<p>over night; that he accompanied Booth at that time to Gardner's,
</p>
<p>from whom he purchased one of the horses used on the night of the
</p>
<p>assassination to aid the escape of one of his confederates; that the
</p>
<p>prisoner had secret interviews with Booth and Surratt, as sworn to by
</p>
<p>the witness Weichmann, in the National Hotel, whether on the 23d
</p>
<p>of December or in January is a matter of entire indifference; that he
</p>
<p>rushed into Mr. Norton's room on the 3d of March in search of Booth;
</p>
<p>and that he was here again on the 10th of April, four days before the
</p>
<p>murder of the President. Of his conduct after the assassination of
</p>
<p>the President, which is confirmatory of all this  his conspiring with

<p>present with the remark that the attempt to prove his character has
</p>
<p>resulted in showing him in sympathy with the rebellion, so cruel that
</p>
<p>he shot one of his slaves and declared his purpose to send several of
</p>
<p>them to work on the rebel batteries in Richmond.
</p>
<p>What others, besides Samuel A. Mudd and John H. Surratt and
</p>
<p>Lewis Payne, did Booth, after his return from Canada, induce to join
</p>
<p>86
</p>
<p>him in this conspiracy to murder the President, the Vice President,
</p>
<p>the Secretary of State, and the Lieutenant General, with the intent
</p>
<p>thereby to aid the rebellion and overthrow the government and laws
</p>
<p>of the United States ?
</p>
<p>On the 10 th of February the prisoners Arnold and O'Laughlin came
</p>
<p>to Washington and took rooms in the bouse of Mrs. Vantyne; were
</p>
<p>armed; were there , visited frequently by John Wilkes Booth, and
</p>
<p>alone; were occasionally absent when Booth called, who seemed
</p>
<p>anxious for their return  would sometimes leave notes for them, and
</p>
<p>sometimes a request that when they came in they should be told to
</p>
<p>come to the stable. On the 18th of March last, when Booth played
</p>
<p>in "The Apostate," the witness, Mrs. Vantyne, received frOm
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin complimentary tickets. These persons remained there
</p>
<p>until the 20th of March. They were visited, so far as the witness
</p>
<p>knows, during their stay at her house only" by Booth, save that on a
</p>
<p>single occasion an unknown man came to see them, and remained
</p>
<p>with them over night. They told the witness they were in the "oil
</p>
<p>business." With Mudd, the guilty purpose was sought to be con
</p>
<p>cealed by declaring that he was in the "land business;" with
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin and Arnold it was attempted to be concealed by the pre
</p>
<p>tence that they were in the ' ' oil business. " Booth, it is proved,
</p>
<p>had closed up all connexion with oil business last September. There
</p>
<p>is not a word of testimony to show that the accused, O'Laughlin and
</p>
<p>Arnold, ever invested or sought to invest, in any way or to any
</p>
<p>amount, in the oil business; their silly words betray them; they
</p>
<p>forgot when they uttered that false statement that truth is strong,
</p>
<p>next to the Almighty, and that their crime must find them out was
</p>
<p>the irrevocable and irresistible law of nature and of nature's God.
</p>
<p>One of their co-conspirators, known as yet only to the guilty par
</p>
<p>ties to this damnable plot and to the Infinite, who will unmask and
</p>
<p>avenge all blood-guiltiness," comes to bear witness, unwittingly, against
</p>
<p>them. This unknown conspirator, who dates his letter at South
</p>
<p>Branch Bridge, April 6, 1865, mailed and postmarked Cumberland,
</p>
<p>Maryland, and addressed to John .Wilkes Booth, by his initials,
</p>
<p>"J. W. B.; National 'Hotel, Washington, D. C," was also in the "oil

</p>
<p>speculation." In that letter he says :
</p>
<p>" Friend Wilkes : I received yours of March 12th, and reply as soon as prac
</p>
<p>ticable. I saw French, Brady, and others about the oil speculation. The sub
</p>
<p>scription to the stock amounts to eight thousand dollars, and I add one thousand
</p>
<p>myself, which is about all I can stand. Now, when you sink your well, go
</p>
<p>deep enough; don't fait; everything depends upon you and your helpers.
</p>
<p>87
</p>
<p>If you cannot get through on your trip after you strike oil, strike through
</p>
<p>Thornton gap and across by Capon, Eomney, and down the Branch. I can
</p>
<p>keep you safe from all hardships for a year. I am clear of all surveillance now
</p>
<p>that infernal Purdy is beat. * * * 
</p>
<p>" I send this by Tom, and if he don't get drunk you will get it the 9th. At
</p>
<p>all events, it cannot be understood if lost. * * * *
</p>
<p>"No more, only Jake will be at Green's with the funds. (Signed) Lo.\."
</p>
<p>That this letter is not a fabrication is made apparent by the testi
</p>
<p>mony of Purdy, whose name occurs in the letter. He testified that
</p>
<p>he had been a detective in the government service, and that he had
</p>
<p>been falsely accused, as the letter recites, andjput under arrest ; that
</p>
<p>there was a noted rebel by the name of Grefn living at Thornton
</p>
<p>gap; that there was a servant, who drank, ktaqfwja as "Tom," in the
</p>
<p>neighborhood of South Branch Bridge ; that. there is an obscure route
</p>
<p>through the gap, and as described in the letter ; and that a man com
</p>
<p>monly called "Lon" lives at South Branch Bridge. If the court are
</p>
<p>satisfied  ;and it is for them to judge that this letter was written
</p>
<p>before the assassination, as it purports to have been, and on the day
</p>
<p>of its date, there can be no question with any one who reads it that the
</p>
<p>writer was in the conspiracy, and knew that the time of its execution
</p>
<p>drew nigh. If a conspirator, every word of its contents is evidence
</p>
<p>against every other party to this conspiracy.
</p>
<p>i Who can fail to understand this letter? His words, "go deep
</p>
<p>enough," "don't fail," "everything depends on you and your
</p>
<p>helpers," "if you can't get through on yeur trip afterf you strike oil,
</p>
<p>strike through Thornton gap," &c, arid "I can keep you safe from
</p>
<p>all hardships for a year, " necessarily imply that when he "strikes
</p>
<p>oil" there will be an occasion for a flight ; that a trip, or route, has
</p>
<p>already been determined upon; that he may not be able to go through
</p>
<p>by that route; in whioh event he is to strike for Thornton gap, and
</p>
<p>across by Capon and Romney, and down the branch, for the shelter
</p>
<p>which his co-conspirator offers him. "I am clear of all surveillance
</p>
<p>now"  does any one doubt that the man who wrote those words
</p>
<p>wished to assure Booth that he was no longer watched, and that
</p>
<p>Booth could safely hide with him from his pursuers ? Does any one

</p>
<p>doubt, from the further expression in this letter, "Jake will be at
</p>
<p>Green's with the funds," that this was a part of the price of blood,
</p>
<p>or that the eight thousand dollars subscribed by others, and the one
</p>
<p>thousand additional, subscribed by the writer, were also a part of the
</p>
<p>price to be paid ?
</p>
<p>"The oil business," which was the declared business of O'Laughlin
</p>
<p>88
</p>
<p>and Arnold, was the declared business of the infamous writer of
</p>
<p>this letter; was the declared business of John H. Surratt; was the
</p>
<p>declared business of Booth himself, as explained to Chester and
</p>
<p>Payne; was " t he business" referred to in his telegrams to O'Laugh
</p>
<p>lin, and meant the murder of the President, of his cabinet, and of
</p>
<p>General Grant. The first of these telegrams is dated Washington,
</p>
<p>13th March, and is addressed to M. O'Laughlin, No. 57 North Exeter
</p>
<p>street, Baltimore, Maryland, and is as follows: "Don't you fear to
</p>
<p>neglect your business ; you had better come on at once. J. Booth."
</p>
<p>The telegraphic operator, Hoffman, who sent this despatch from
</p>
<p>Washington, swears that John Wilkes Booth delivered it to him in
</p>
<p>person on the day of its date; and the handwriting of the original
</p>
<p>telegram is established beyond question to be that of Booth. The
</p>
<p>other telegram is dated Washington, March 27, addressed "M.
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin, Esq., 57 North Exeter street, Baltimore, Maryland," and
</p>
<p>is as follows: "Get word to Sam. Come on with or without him
</p>
<p>on Wednesday morning. We sell that day sure; don't fail. J.
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth." The original of this telegram is also proved to be in
</p>
<p>the handwriting of Booth. The sale referred to in this last telegram
</p>
<p>was doubtless the murder of the President and others  the "oil
</p>
<p>speculation," in which the writer of the letter from South Branch
</p>
<p>Bridge, dated April 6, had taken a thousand dollars, and in which
</p>
<p>Booth said there was money, and Sanders said there was money,
</p>
<p>and Atzerodt said there was money. The words of this telegram,
</p>
<p>" get word to Sam," mean Samuel Arnold, his co-conspirator, who
</p>
<p>had been with him during all his stay in Washington, at Mrs. Van
</p>
<p>tyne' s. These parties to this conspiracy, after they had gone to
</p>
<p>Baltimore, had additional correspondence with Booth, which the
</p>
<p>court must infer had relation tO carryirig out the purposes of their
</p>
<p>confederation and agreement. The colored witness, Williams, testifies
</p>
<p>that John Wilkes Booth handed him a letter for Michael O'Laughlin,
</p>
<p>and another for Samuel Arnold, in Baltimore, some time in March
</p>
<p>last; one of which he delivered to O'Laughlin at the theatre in Balti
</p>
<p>more, and the other to a lady at the door where Arnold boarded in
</p>
<p>Baltimore. Their agreement and co-operation in the common object having

<p>been thus established, the letter written to Booth by the prisoner
</p>
<p>Arnold, dated March 27, 1865, the handwriting of which is proved
</p>
<p>before the court, and which was found in Booth's possession after the
</p>
<p>assassination, becomes testimony against O'Laughlin, as well as
</p>
<p>89
</p>
<p>.against the writer Arnold, because it is an act done in furtherance
</p>
<p>of their combination. That letter is as follows:
</p>
<p>" Dear John : Was business so important that you could not remain in
</p>
<p>Baltimore till I saw you ? I came in as soon as I could, but found you had
</p>
<p>gone to Washington. I called also to see Mike, but learned from his mother
</p>
<p>he had gone out with you and had not returned. I concluded, therefore, he
</p>
<p>had gone with yon. How inconsiderate you have been ! When I left you,
</p>
<p>you stated that we would not meet in a month or so, and therefore I made appli
</p>
<p>cation for employment, an answer to which I shall receive during the week. I
</p>
<p>told my parents I had ceased with you. Can I then, under existing circum
</p>
<p>stances, act as you request? You know full well that the government suspi
</p>
<p>cions something is going on there, therefore the undertaking is becoming more
</p>
<p>complicated. Why not, for the present, desist %  for various reasons, which, if
</p>
<p>you look into, you can readily see without my making any mention thereof*
</p>
<p>You nor any one can censure me for my prese&t course. You have been its
</p>
<p>cause, for how can I now come after telling them I had left you 1 Suspicion
</p>
<p>rests upon me now from my whole family, and even parties in the country. I
</p>
<p>will he compelled to leave home any how, and how soon I care not. None, no,
</p>
<p>not one, were more in favor of the enterprise than myself, and to-day would be
</p>
<p>there had you not done as you have. By this, I mean manner of proceeding.
</p>
<p>I am, as you well know, mneed. I am, you may say, in rags, whereas, to-day, I
</p>
<p>ought to he well clothed. I do nofr-feel right Stalking about with means, and
</p>
<p>more from appearances a beggar. I feel my dependence. But. even all this
</p>
<p>Would have been, and was, forgotten, for I was one with you. Time more pro-
</p>
<p>vitious will arrive yet. Do not act rashly or in haste. I would prefer your
</p>
<p>first query, 'Go and see how it will be takeu in Kichmond,' and erelong I
</p>
<p>shall be better prepared to again he with you. I dislike writing. Would
</p>
<p>sooner verbally make known my views. Yet your now waiting causes me thus
</p>
<p>to proceed. Do not in anger peruse this. Weigh all I have said, and, as a ra

<p>tional man and a friend, you cannot ceusure or upbraid my conduct. I sin
</p>
<p>cerely trust this, nor aught else that shall or may occur, will ever be an obsta

</p>
<p>as I expect to be in about Wednesday or Thursday; or, if you can possibly

</p>
<p>SAM."
</p>
<p>Here is the confession of the prisoner Arnold, that he was one with
</p>
<p>Booth in this conspiracy; the further confession that they are suspected
</p>
<p>by the government of their country, and the acknowledgment that since
</p>
<p>they parted Booth had communicated, among other* things, a suggestion
</p>
<p>which leads to the remark in this letter, "I would prefer your first
</p>
<p>query, ' Go and see how it will be taken at Richmond,' and ere long
</p>
<p>90
</p>
<p>I shall be better prepared to again be with you." This is a declara
</p>
<p>tion that affects Arnold, Booth, and O'Laughlin alike, if the court
</p>
<p>are satisfied, and it is difficult to see how they can have doubt on the .
</p>
<p>subject, that the matter to be referred to Richmond is the matter of
</p>
<p>the assassination of the President and others, to effect which these
</p>
<p>parties had previously agreed and conspired together. It is a matter
</p>
<p>in testimony, by the declaration of John H. Surratt, who is as clearly
</p>
<p>proved to have been in this conspiracy and murder as Booth himself,
</p>
<p>that about the very date of this letter, the 27th of March, upon the
</p>
<p>suggestion of Booth, and with his knowledge and consent, he went
</p>
<p>to Richmond, not only to see "how it would be taken there," but to
</p>
<p>get funds with which to carry out the enterprise, as Booth had already
</p>
<p>declared to Chester in one of his last interviews, when he said that he
</p>
<p>or "some one of the party" would be constrained to go to Richmond
</p>
<p>for funds to carry out the conspiracy. Surratt returned from Rich
</p>
<p>mond, bringing with him some part of the money for which he went, ,
</p>
<p>and was then going to Canada, and, as the testimony discloses, bring
</p>
<p>ing with him the despatches from Jefferson Davis to his chief agents
</p>
<p>in Canada, which,, as Thompson declared to Conover, made the pro
</p>
<p>posed assassination "all right." Surratt, after seeingthe parties
</p>
<p>here, left immediately for Canada and delivered his despatches to
</p>
<p>Jacob Thompson, the agent of Jefferson Davis. This was done by
</p>
<p>Surratt upon the suggestion, or in exact accordance with the sugges
</p>
<p>tion, of Arnold, made on the 27th of March in his letter to Booth just
</p>
<p>read, and yet you are gravely told that four weeks before the 27th of
</p>
<p>March Arnold had abandoned the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Surratt reached Canada with these despatches, as we have' seen,
</p>
<p>about the 6th or 7th of April last, when the witness Conover saw
</p>
<p>them delivered to Jacob Thompson and heard their contents stated
</p>
<p>by Thompson, and the declaration from him that these despatches
</p>
<p>made it "all right." That Surratt was at that time in Canada is not
</p>
<p>only established by the testimony of Conover, but it is also in evi
</p>
<p>dence that he told Weichmann on the 3d of April that he was going
</p>
<p>to Canada, and on that day left for Canada, and afterwards, two let
</p>
<p>ters addressed by Surratt over the fictitious signature of John Har

</p>
<p>rison, to his mother and to Miss Ward, dated at Montreal, were re
</p>
<p>ceived by them on the 14th of April, as testified by Weichmann and
</p>
<p>by Miss Ward, a witness called for the defence. Thus it appears
</p>
<p>that the condition named by Arnold in his letter had been complied
</p>
<p>with. Booth had "gone to Richmond," in the person of Surratt,
</p>
<p>"to see how it would be taken." The rebel authorities at Rich-
</p>
<p>91 
</p>
<p>mond had approved it, the agent had returned, and Arnold was, in his
</p>
<p>own words, thereby the better prepared to rejoin Booth in the prose
</p>
<p>cution of this conspiracy.
</p>
<p>". To this end Arnold went to Fortress Monroe. As his letter ex
</p>
<p>pressly declares, Booth said when they parted, " we would not
</p>
<p>meet in a month or so, and therefore I made application for employ
</p>
<p>ment  an answer to which I shall receive during the week." He
</p>
<p>did receive the answer that week from Fortress Monroe, and went
</p>
<p>thereto await the "more propitious time," bearing with him the
</p>
<p>weapon of death which Booth had provided and ready to obey his
</p>
<p>call, as the act had been approved at Richmond and been made " all
</p>
<p>right." Acting upon the same fact that the conspiracy had been ap
</p>
<p>proved in Richmond and the funds provided, O'Laughlin came to
</p>
<p>Washington to identify General Grant, the person who was to be
</p>
<p>come the victim of his violence in the final consummation of this
</p>
<p>crime  General Grant, whom, as is averred in the specification, it
</p>
<p>had become the part of 0' Laughlin by his agreement in this conspir
</p>
<p>acy to kill and murder. On the evening preceding the assassination 
</p>
<p>the 13th of April  by the testimony of three reputable witnesses,
</p>
<p>against whose truthfulness not one word is uttered here or elsewhere,
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin went into the house of the Secretary of War, where Gen
</p>
<p>eral Grant then was, and placed himself in position in the hall where he
</p>
<p>could see him, having declared before he reached that point to one
</p>
<p>of these witnesses that he wished to see General Grant. The house
</p>
<p>was brilliantly illuminated at the time; two at least of the witnesses
</p>
<p>conversed with the accused and the other stood very near to him,
</p>
<p>took special notice of his conduct, called attention to it, and suggested
</p>
<p>that he be put out of the house, and he was accordingly put out by
</p>
<p>one of the witnesses. These witnesses are confident, and have no
</p>
<p>doubt, and so swear upon their oaths, that Michael 0' Laughlin is the
</p>
<p>man who was present on that occasion. There is no denial on the
</p>
<p>part of the accused that he was in Washington during the day and
</p>
<p>during the night of April 13, and also during the day and during the
</p>
<p>night of the 14th; and yqt, to get Tid of this testimony, recourse is
</p>
<p>had to that common device  an alibi; a device never, I may say,

<p>more frequently resorted to than in this trial. But what an alibi I
</p>
<p>Nobody is called to prove it, save some men who, by their own
</p>
<p>: testimony, were engaged in a drunken debauch through the evening.
</p>
<p>A -reasonable man who reads their evidence can hardly be expected
</p>
<p>to allow it to outweigh the united testimony of three unimpeached

</p>

<p>take special notice of the prisoner by reason of his extraordinary
</p>
<p>conduct. These Witnesses describe accurately the appearance, stature, and
</p>
<p>complexion of the accused, but because they describe his clothing as
</p>
<p>dark or black, it is urged that as part of his clothing, although dark,
</p>
<p>was not black, the witnesses are mistaken. O'Laughlin and his
</p>
<p>drunken companions (one of whom swears that he drank ten times
</p>
<p>that evening) were strolling in the streets and in the direction
</p>
<p>of the house of the Secretary of War, up the Avenue; but ypu
</p>
<p>are asked to* believe that these witnesses could not be mistaken
</p>
<p>in saying they were not off the Avenue above 7th street, or on K
</p>
<p>street. I venture to say that no man who reads their testimony can
</p>
<p>determine satisfactorily all the places that were visited by O'Laugh
</p>
<p>lin and his drunken associates that evening from 7 to 11 o'clock
</p>
<p>p. m. All this time, frOm 7 to 11 o'clock p. m., must be accounted for
</p>
<p>satisfactorily before the alibi can be established. Laughlan does not
</p>
<p>account for all the time, for he left O'Laughlin after 7 o'clock,
</p>
<p>and rejoined him, as he says, "I suppose about 8 o'clock." Grillet
</p>
<p>did not meet him until half-past ten, and then only casually saw him
</p>
<p>in passing the hotel. May not Grillet have been mistaken as to the
</p>
<p>fact, although he did meet O'Laughlin after 11 o'clock the same
</p>
<p>evening, as he swears?
</p>
<p>Purdy swears to seeing him in the bar with Grillet about half-past
</p>
<p>10, but, as we have seen by Grillet' s testimony, it must have been
</p>
<p>after 11 o'clock. Murphy contradicts, as to time, both Grillet and
</p>
<p>Purdy, for he says it was half-past 11 or 12 o'clock when he and
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin returned to Rullman's from Platz's, and Early swears the
</p>
<p>accused went from Rullman's to 2d street to a dance about a quarter-
</p>
<p>past 11 o'clock, when O'Laughlin took the lead in the dance and stayed
</p>
<p>about one hour. I follow these witnesses no further. They contra
</p>
<p>dict each other, and do not account for O'Laughlin all the time from
</p>
<p>7 to 11 o'clock. I repeat that no man can read their testimony with'
</p>
<p>out finding contradictions most material as to time, and coming to the

<p>conviction that they utterly fail to account for 0' Laughlin' s wherea
</p>
<p>bouts on that evening. To establish an alibi, the witnesses must know
</p>
<p>the fact and testify to it. Laughlan, Grillet, Purdy, Murphy, and
</p>
<p>Early utterly fail to prove it, and only succeed in showing that they
</p>
<p>did not know where O'Laughlin was all this time, and that some of
</p>
<p>93
</p>
<p>them were grossly mistaken in what they testified, both as to time and
</p>
<p>place. The testimony of James B. Henderson is equally unsatisfac
</p>
<p>tory. He is contradicted by other testimony of the accused as to
</p>
<p>place. He says O'Laughliri went up the Avenue above. 7th street, but
</p>
<p>that he did not go to 9th street. The other witnesses swear he went
</p>
<p>to 9th street. He swears he went to Canterbury about 9 o' clock,
</p>
<p>after going back from 7th street to Rullman's. Laughlan swears that
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin was with him at the corner of the Avenue and 9th street
</p>
<p>at 9 o'clock, and went from there to Canterbury, while Early
</p>
<p>swears that O'Laughlin went up as far as llth street and returned
</p>
<p>with him and took supper at Welcker's about 8 o'clock. If these
</p>
<p>witnesses prove an alibi, it is really against each other. It is folly
</p>
<p>to pretend that they prove facts which make it impossible that
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin could have been at the house of Secretary Stanton, as
</p>
<p>three witnesses swear he was, on the evening of the 13th of April,
</p>
<p>looking for General Grant.
</p>
<p>Has it not, by the testimony thus reviewed, been established prima
</p>
<p>facie that in the months of February, March, and April, O'Laughlin
</p>
<p>had combined, confederated, and agreed with John Wilkes Booth and
</p>
<p>Samuel Arnold to kill and murder Abraham Lincoln, William H.
</p>
<p>Seward,  Andrew Johnson, and Ulysses S. Grant? Is it not estab
</p>
<p>lished, beyond a shadow of doubt, that Booth had so conspired with
</p>
<p>the rebel ageritsin Canada as early as October last; that he was in
</p>
<p>search of agents to do the work on pay, in the interests of the re-
</p>
<p>belfion, and that in this speculation Arnold and O'Laughlin had joined
</p>
<p>as early as February ; that then, and after, with Booth and Surratt,
</p>
<p>they were in the "oil business," which was the business of assassina
</p>
<p>tion by contract as a speculation? If this conspiracy on the part of
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin with Arnold is established even prima facie, the declara
</p>
<p>tions and acts of Arnold and Booth, the other conspirators, in fur
</p>
<p>therance of the common design, is evidence against O'Laughlin as
</p>
<p>well as against Arnold himself or the other parties. The rule of law
</p>
<p>is, that the act Or declaration of one conspirator, done in pursuance or
</p>
<p>furtherance of the common design, is the act or declaration of all
</p>
<p>the conspirators. (1 Wharton, 706.)

</p>
<p>The letter, therefore, of his co-conspirator, Arnold, is evidence
</p>
<p>against O'Laughlin, because it is an act in the prosecution of the com
</p>
<p>mon conspiracy, suggesting what should be done in order to make it
</p>
<p>effective, and which suggestion, as has been stated, was followed
</p>
<p>out. The defence has attempted to avoid the force of this letter by
</p>
<p>reciting the statement of Arnold, made to Horner at the time he
</p>
<p>94
</p>
<p>was arrested, in which he declared, among' other things, that the
</p>
<p>purpose was to abduct President Lincoln and take him south; that
</p>
<p>it was to be done at the theatre by throwing the President out of the
</p>
<p>box upon the floor of the stage, when the accused was to catch him.
</p>
<p>The very announcement of this testimony excited derision that such
</p>
<p>a tragedy meant only to take the President and carry him gently
</p>
<p>away ! This pigmy to catch the giant as the assassins hurled him to
</p>
<p>the floor from an elevation of twelve feet ! The court has viewed the
</p>
<p>theatre, and must be satisfied that Booth, in leaping from the Presi
</p>
<p>dent's box, broke his limb. The court cannot fail to conclude that
</p>
<p>this statement of Arnold was but another silly device, like that of
</p>
<p>"the oil business," which, for the time being, he employed to hide
</p>
<p>from the knowledge of his captor the fact that the purpose was to
</p>
<p>murder the President. No man can, for a moment, believe that any
</p>
<p>one of these conspirators hoped or desired, by such a proceeding as
</p>
<p>that stated by this prisoner, to take the President alive in the pres
</p>
<p>ence of thousands assembled in the theatre after he had been thus
</p>
<p>thrown upon the floor of the stage, much less to carry him through
</p>
<p>the city, through the lines of your army, and deliver him into the
</p>
<p>hands of the rebels. No such purpose was expressed or hinted by
</p>
<p>the conspirators in Canada, who commissioned Booth to let these as
</p>
<p>sassinations on contract. I shall waste not a moment more in combat
</p>
<p>ting such an absurdity.
</p>
<p>7 Arnold does confess that he was a conspirator with Booth in this-
</p>
<p>'purposed murder; that Booth had a letter of introduction to Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd ; that Booth, O'Laughlin, Atzerodt, Surratt, a man with an
</p>
<p>alias, ' ' Mosby, ' ' and another whom he does not know, and himself,
</p>
<p>were parties to this conspiracy, and that Booth had furnished them
</p>
<p>all with arms. He concludes this remarkable statement to Horner
</p>
<p>with the declaration that at that tiine, to wit, the first week of
</p>
<p>March, or four weeks before he went to Fortress Monroe, he left the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, and that Booth told him to sell his arms if he chose.
</p>
<p>This is sufficiently answered by the fact that, four weeks afterwards,
</p>
<p>he wrote his letter to Booth, which was found in Booth's possession
</p>
<p>after the assassination, suggesting to him what to do in order to make

</p>
<p>the conspiracy a success, and by the further fact that at the very
</p>
<p>moment he uttered these declarations, part of his arms were found
</p>
<p>upon his person, and the rest not disposed of, but at his father's
</p>
<p>house. A party to a treasonable and murderous conspiracy against the
</p>
<p>government of his country cannot be held to have abandoned it be-
</p>
<p>95
</p>
<p>cause he makes such a declaration as this, when he is in the hands of
</p>
<p>the officer of the law, arrested for his crime, and especially when hi3
</p>
<p>declaration is in conflict with and expressly contradicted by his
</p>
<p>written acts, and unsupported by any conduct of his which becomes
</p>
<p>a citizen and a man.
</p>
<p>If he abandoned the conspiracy, why did he not make known the
</p>
<p>fact to Abraham Lincoln and his constitutional advisers that these
</p>
<p>men, armed with the weapons of assassination, were daily lying in
</p>
<p>wait for their lives? To pretend that a man who thus conducts him
</p>
<p>self for weeks after the pretended abandonment, volunteering advice
</p>
<p>for the successful prosecution of the conspiracy, the evidence of which
</p>
<p>is in writing, and about which there can be no mistake, has, ( in fact,
</p>
<p>abandoned it, is to insult the common understanding of men.
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin having conspired with Arnold to do this murder, is,
</p>
<p>^therefore, as much concluded by the letter of Arnold of the 27th of
</p>
<p>March as is Arnold himself. The further testimony touching 0' Laughlin,
</p>
<p>that of Streett, establishes the fact that about the 1st of April he
</p>
<p>saw him in confidential conversation with J. Wilkes Booth, in this city,
</p>
<p>on the Avenue. Another man, whom the witness does not know, was in
</p>
<p>conversation. O'Laughlin called Streett to one.side, and told him Booth
</p>
<p>was busily engaged with his friend  was talking privately to his friend.
</p>
<p>This remark of O'Laughlin is attempted to be accounted for, but the
</p>
<p>.attempt failed ; his counsel taking the pains to ask what induced
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin to make the remark, received the fit reply: "I did not
</p>
<p>Bee the interior of Mr. 0' Laughlin' s mind ; I cannot tell." It is the
</p>
<p>province of this court to infer why that remark was made, and what
</p>
<p>it signified.
</p>
<p>; That John H. Surratt, George A. Atzerodt, Mary E. Surratt, David
</p>
<p>E.Herold, and Louis Payne, entered into this conspiracy with Booth,
</p>
<p>is so. very clear upon the testimony, that little time need be occu
</p>
<p>pied in bringing again before the court the evidence which establishes
</p>
<p>it. By the testimouy of Weichmann we find Atzerodt in February at
</p>
<p>the house of the prisoner, Mrs. Surratt. He inquired for her or for
</p>
<p>John when he came and remained over night. After this and before
</p>
<p>the assassination he visited there frequently, and at that house bore

</p>
<p>the name of "Port Tobacco," the name by which he was known in
</p>
<p>Canada among the conspirators there. The same witness testifies
</p>
<p>that he met him on the street, when he said he was going to visit
</p>
<p>Payne at the Herndon House, and also accompanied him, along with
</p>
<p>Herold and John H. Surratt, to the theatre in March to hear Booth
</p>
<p>play in the Apostate. At the Pennsylvania House, one or two weeks
</p>
<p>96
</p>
<p>previous to the assassination, Atzerodt made the statement to Lieuten
</p>
<p>ant Keim, when asking for his knife which he had left in his room, a
</p>
<p>knife corresponding in size with the one exhibited in court, "I want
</p>
<p>that; if one fails I want the other," wearing at the same time his
</p>
<p>revolver at his belt. He also stated to GreenaWalt, of the Pennsyl
</p>
<p>vania House, in March, that he was nearly broke, but had friends
</p>
<p>enough to give him as much money as would see him through, adding,
</p>
<p>"I am going away some of these days, but will return with as much
</p>
<p>gold as will keep me all my lifetime." Mr. Greenawalt also says
</p>
<p>that Booth had frequent interviews with Atzerodt, sometimes in the
</p>
<p>room, and at other times Booth would walk in and immediately go
</p>
<p>out, Atzerodt following.
</p>
<p>John M. Lloyd testifies that some six weeks oefore the assassina
</p>
<p>tion, Herold, Atzerodt, and John H. Surratt came to his house at Sur-
</p>
<p>rattsville, bringing with them two Spencer carbines with ammuni
</p>
<p>tion, also a rope and wrench. Surratt asked the witness to take
</p>
<p>care of them, and to conceal the carbines. Surratt took him into a
</p>
<p>room in the house, it being his mother's house, and showed the wit
</p>
<p>ness where to put the carbines, between the joists on the second floor.
</p>
<p>The carbines were put there according to his directions, and con
</p>
<p>cealed. Marcus P. Norton saw Atzerodt in conversation with Booth
</p>
<p>at the National Hotel about the 2d or 3d of March ; the conversa
</p>
<p>tion was confidential, and the witness accidentally heard them talking
</p>
<p>in regard to President Johnson, and say that ' ' the class of witnesses
</p>
<p>would be of that character that there could be little proven by them."
</p>
<p>This conversation may throw some light on the fact that Atzerodt
</p>
<p>was found in possession of Booth's bank book 1
</p>
<p>Colonel Nevens testifies that on the 12th of April last he saw At
</p>
<p>zerodt at the Kirkwood House; that Atzerodt there asked him, a
</p>
<p>stranger, if he knew where Vice President Johnson was, and where
</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson' s room was. Colonel Nevens showed him where the room
</p>
<p>of the Vice President was, and told him that the Vice President was
</p>
<p>then at dinner. Atzerodt then looked into the dining-room, where
</p>
<p>Vice President Johnson was dining alone. Robert R. Jones, the
</p>
<p>clerk at the Kirkwood House, states that on the 14th, the day of

</p>
<p>the murder, two days after this, Atzerodt registered his name at the
</p>
<p>hotel, G. A. Atzerodt, and took No. 126, retaining the room that
</p>
<p>day, and carrying away the key. In this room, after the assassina
</p>
<p>tion, were found the knife and revolver with which he intended to
</p>
<p>murder the Vice President.
</p>
<p>The testimony of all these witnesses leaves no doubt that the
</p>
<p>97
</p>
<p>prisoner George A. Atzerodt entered into this conspiracy with Booth ;
</p>
<p>that he expected to receive a large compensation for the service that
</p>
<p>he would render in its execution ; that he had undertaken the assassi
</p>
<p>nation of the Vice President for a price ; that he, with Surratt and
</p>
<p>Herold, rendered the important service of depositing the arms and
</p>
<p>ammunition to be used by Booth and his confederates as a protection
</p>
<p>in their flight after the conspiracy had been executed ; and that he
</p>
<p>was careful to have his intended victim pointed out to him, and the
</p>
<p>room he occupied in the hotel, so that when he came to perform his
</p>
<p>horrid work he would know' precisely where to go and whom to
</p>
<p>strike. I take no further notice now of the preparation which this prisoner
</p>
<p>made for the successful execution of this part of the traitorous and mur- ,
</p>
<p>derons design. The- question is, did he enter into this conspiracy ?
</p>
<p>His language overheard by Mr. Norton excludes every other con
</p>
<p>clusion. Vice President Johnson's name was mentioned in that
</p>
<p>secret conversation with Booth, and the very suggestive expression
</p>
<p>was made between them that "little could be proved by the wit
</p>
<p>nesses." His confession in his defence is conclusive of his guilt.
</p>
<p>That Payne was in this conspiracy is confessed in the defence
</p>
<p>made- by his counsel, and is also evident from the facts proved, that
</p>
<p>when the conspiracy was being organized in Canada by Thompson,
</p>
<p>Sanders, Tucker, Cleary, and Clay, this man Payne stood at the
</p>
<p>door of Thompson' ; was recommended and indorsed by Clay with the
</p>
<p>words, " We trust him ;" that after coming hither he first reported
</p>
<p>; himself at the house of Mrs. Mary E. Surratt, inquired for her and for
</p>
<p>John H. Surratt, remained there for four days, having conversation
</p>
<p>with both of them ; having provided himself with means of disguise,
</p>
<p>was also supplied with pistols and a knife, such as he afterwards
</p>
<p>used, and spurs, preparatory to his flight ; was seen with John H.
</p>
<p>Surratt, practicing with krii'ves such as those employed in this deed
</p>
<p>of assassination, and now before the court ; was afterwards provided
</p>
<p>with lodging at the Herndon House, at the instance of Surratt ; was
</p>
<p>visited there by Atzerodt, arid attended Booth and Surratt to Ford's
</p>
<p>theatre, occupying with those parties the box, as I believe and which
</p>
<p>we may readily infer, in which the President was afterwards mur

<p>dered. If further testimony be wanting that he had entered into the con
</p>
<p>spiracy, it may be found in the fact sworn to by Weichmann, whose
</p>
<p>testimony no candid man will discredit, that about the 20th of March
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt, in great excitement, and weeping, said that her son
</p>
<p>7b
</p>
<p>98
</p>
<p>John had gone away not to return, when about three hours subse
</p>
<p>quently; in the afternoon of the same day, John H. Surratt re
</p>
<p>appeared,' came rushing in a state of frenzy into the room, in his
</p>
<p>mother's house, armed, declaring Jhe would shoot whoever came into
</p>
<p>the room, arid proclaiming that his prospects were blasted and his
</p>
<p>hopes gone ; \hat soon Payne came into the same room, also armed
</p>
<p>and under great excitement, and Was immediately followed by
</p>
<p>Booth, with his' riding-whip in his hand; who walked rapidly across
</p>
<p>the floor from side to side, so much excited that for some time he did
</p>
<p>not notice the presence of the witness. Observing Weichmann the
</p>
<p>parties then withdrew, upon a suggestion from Booth, to an upper
</p>
<p>room, apd there had a private interview. From all that transpired
</p>
<p>on that occasion, it is apparent that when these parties left the house
</p>
<p>that day, it was with the full purpose of completing- some act essen
</p>
<p>tial to the final execution of the work of assassination, in conformity
</p>
<p>with their previous .confederation and agreement. They returned
</p>
<p>foiled  from what cause is unknown  dejected, angry, and .covered
</p>
<p>with confusion.
</p>
<p>It is almost imposing upon the patience of the court to consume
</p>
<p>time in demonstrating the fact, which none conversant with the testi
</p>
<p>mony of this case can for a moment doubt, that John H. Surratt
</p>
<p>and Mary E. Surratt were as surely in the conspiracy to murder the
</p>
<p>President as was John Wilkes Booth himself. You have the frequent
</p>
<p>interviews between John H. Surratt and Booth, his intimate relations
</p>
<p>with Payne, his visits from Atzerodt and Herold, his deposit of the
</p>
<p>arms to cover their flight after the conspiracy should have been exe
</p>
<p>cuted ; his own declared visit to Richmond to do what Booth himself
</p>
<p>said to Chester must be done, to wit, that, he or some of the party
</p>
<p>mustgo to Richmond in order to get funds to carry out the conspiracy ;
</p>
<p>that he brought back with him gold, the price of blood, confessing
</p>
<p>himself that he was there ; that he immediately went to Canada,
</p>
<p>delivered despatches in cipher to Jacob Thompson from Jefferson
</p>
<p>Davis, which were interpreted and read by Thompson in the presence
</p>
<p>of the witness Conover, and in which the conspiracy was approved,
</p>
<p>and, in the language of Thompson, the proposed assassination was

<p>"made all right."
</p>
<p>One other fact, if any other fact be needed, and I have done with
</p>
<p>the evidence which proves that John H. Surratt entered into this
</p>
<p>combination; that is, that it appears by the testimony of the witness,
</p>
<p>the cashier ^of the Ontario Bank,. Montreal, that Jacob Thompson,
</p>
<p>about the day that these despatches were delivered, and while Sur-
</p>
<p>99
</p>
<p>ratt was then present in Canada, drew from that bank of the rebel
</p>
<p>funds there on deposit the sum of one hundred and eighty thousand
</p>
<p>dollars. This being done, Surratt finding it safer, doubtless, to go
</p>
<p>to Canada for the great bulk of funds whiph were to be distributed
</p>
<p>amongst these hired assassins than to attempt to carry it through
</p>
<p>our lines direct from Richmond, immediately returned to Washing
</p>
<p>ton and was present in this city, as is proven by the testimony of
</p>
<p>Mr. Reid, on the afternoon of the 14th of April, the day of the assassi
</p>
<p>nation, booted and spurred, ready for the flight whenever the fatal
</p>
<p>blow should .have been struck. If he was not a conspirator and a
</p>
<p>party to this great crime, how comes it that from that hour to this
</p>
<p>no man has seen him in the capital, nor has he been reported any
</p>
<p>where outside of Canada, having arrived at Montreal, as -the testi
</p>
<p>mony shows, on the 18th of April, four days after the murder ?
</p>
<p>Nothing but his conscious coward guilt could possibly induce him to
</p>
<p>absent himself from his mother, as he, does, upon her trial. Being
</p>
<p>one of these conspirators, as charged, every act of hi3 in the prosecu
</p>
<p>tion of this crime is evidence against the other parties to the con-
</p>
<p>, spiracy. ' That Mary E. Surratt is as guilty as her son of having thus con
</p>
<p>spired, combined, and corifederated .to do this murder, in aid of this
</p>
<p>rebellion, is clear. " First, her house was the headquarters of
</p>
<p>Booth, John H. Surratt, . Atzerodt, Payne, and Herold. She is in
</p>
<p>quired for by Atzerodt ; she is inquired for by Payne ; and she is
</p>
<p>visited by Booth, and holds private conversations with him- His
</p>
<p>picture, together with that of the chief conspirator, Jefferson Davis,

<p>is found in her house. She sends to Booth for a carriage to take her,

<p>on the llth of April, to Surrattsville for the. purpose of perfecting

<p>the arrangement deemed necessary to the successful execution of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, and especially to facilitate and protect the conspirators

<p>in their escape from justice. On that occasion Booth, having dis
</p>
<p>posed of his carriage, gives to the agent she employed ten dollars
</p>
<p>with which to hire a conveyance for that purpose. And yet the pre

<p>sence is made that Mrs. Surratt went on the llth to Surrattsville ex
</p>
<p>clusively upon her own private and lawful business. Can any one

</p>
<p>conveyance, and how it comes that he, of his own accord having no
</p>
<p>conveyance to furnish her, should send her ten dollars with which to
</p>
<p>procure it? There is not the slightest indication that Booth was
</p>
<p>under any obligation to her, or that she had any claim upon him,
</p>
<p>either-for a conveyance or for the means with which to procure one,
</p>
<p>100
</p>
<p>except that he was bound to contribute, being the agent of the con
</p>
<p>spirators in Canada and Richmond, whatever money might be neces
</p>
<p>sary to the consummation of this infernal plot. On that day, the llth
</p>
<p>of April, John H. Surratt had not returned from Canada with the
</p>
<p>funds furnished by Thompson 1
</p>
<p>Upon that journey of the llth the accused, Mary E. Surratt,
</p>
<p>met the witness John M. Lloyd at Uniontown. She called him;
</p>
<p>he got out of his carriage and came to her, and she whispered to
</p>
<p>him in so low a tone that her attendant could not hear her words,
</p>
<p>though Lloyd, to whom they were spoken, did distinctly hear
</p>
<p>them, and testifies that she told him he should have those "shoot
</p>
<p>ing-irons" ready, meaning the carbines which her son and Herold
</p>
<p>and Atzerodt had deposited with him, and added the reason,
</p>
<p>"for they would soon be called for." On. the day of the assas
</p>
<p>sination she again sent for Booth, had an interview with him in
</p>
<p>her own house, and immediately went again to Surrattsville, and
</p>
<p>then, at about six o'clock in the afternoon, she delivered to Lloyd a
</p>
<p>field-glass and told him "to have two bottles of whiskey and the
</p>
<p>carbines readj, as they would be called for that night." Having
</p>
<p>thus perfected the arrangement she returned to Washington to her
</p>
<p>own house, at about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, to await
</p>
<p>the final result. How could this 'woman anticipate on Friday after
</p>
<p>noon, at six o'clock, that these arms would be called for and would
</p>
<p>be needed that night unless she was in the conspiracy and knew the
</p>
<p>blow was to be struck, and the flight of the assassins attempted aud
</p>
<p>by that route ? Was not the private conversation which Booth held
</p>
<p>with her in her parlor on the afternoon of the 14th of April, just -
</p>
<p>before she left on this business, in relation to the orders she should :
</p>
<p>give to have the arms ready?
</p>
<p>An endeavor is made to impeach Lloyd. But the court will *
</p>
<p>observe that no witness has been called who contradicts Lloyd's -
</p>
<p>statement in any material matter; neither has his general character ;
</p>
<p>for truth been assailed. How, then, is he impeached? Is it claimed t
</p>
<p>that his testimony shows that he was a party to the conspiracy ? :
</p>
<p>Then it is conceded by those who set up any such pretence that

</p>
<p>there was a conspiracy. A conspiracy between whom ? There can ~
</p>
<p>be no conspiracy without the co-operation or agreement of two or .j
</p>
<p>more persons. Who were the other parties to it? Was it Mary E. i
</p>
<p>Surratt? Was it John H. Surratt, George A. Atzerodt, David E. *
</p>
<p>Herold? Those are the only persons, so far as his own testimony or:t
</p>
<p>the testimony of any other witness discloses, with whom he had any)
</p>
<p>101
</p>
<p>communication whatever on any subject immediately or remotely
</p>
<p>touching this conspiracy before the assassination. His receipt and
</p>
<p>concealment of the arms are, unexplained, evidence that he was in
</p>
<p>the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>The explanation is that he was dependent upon Mary E. Surratt;
</p>
<p>was her tenant; and his declaration, given in evidence by the accused
</p>
<p>herself, is that "she had ruined him, and brought this trouble upon
</p>
<p>him." But because he was weak enough, or wicked enough, to be
</p>
<p>come the guilty depositary of these arms, and to deliver them on the
</p>
<p>order of Mary E. Surratt to the assassins; it does not follow that he
</p>
<p>is not to be believed on oath. It is said that he concealed the facts, that
</p>
<p>the arms had been left and called for. He so testifies himself, but he
</p>
<p>Ogives the reason that he did. it only from apprehension of danger to
</p>
<p>his life. If he were in .the conspiracy, his general credit being
</p>
<p>unchallenged, his testimony being uncontradicted -in any material
</p>
<p>patter, he is to be, believed, and cannot be disbelieved if his testi
</p>
<p>mony is substantially corroborated by other reliable witnesses. Is
</p>
<p>he not corrobc-rated touching the deposit of arms by the fact that the
</p>
<p>' arms are produced in court  one of which was found upon the
</p>
<p>" person of Booth at the time he was overtaken and slain, and which is
</p>
<p>identified as the same which had been left, with Lloyd by Herold,
</p>
<p>Surratt, and Atzerodt ? Is he not corroborated in the fact of the first
</p>
<p>interview with Mrs. Surratt by the joint testimony of Mrs. Offut and
</p>
<p>Lewis J. Weichmann, each of whom testified, (and they are contra
</p>
<p>dicted by no one,) that on Tuesday, the llth day of April, at Umon-
</p>
<p>town, Mrs-. Surratt called Mr. Lloyd to come to her, which he did,
</p>
<p>and she held a secret conversation with him ? Is he riot corroborated
</p>
<p>a9 to the last conversation on the 14th of April by the testimony of
</p>
<p>Mrs. Offut, who swears that upon the evening of the 14th of April
</p>
<p>ebe saw the prisoner, Mary E. Surratt, at Lloyd's house, approach
</p>
<p>and hold conversation with him ? Is he not corroborated in the fact,
</p>
<p>to which he swears, that Mrs. Surratt delivered to him at that time
</p>
<p>the field-glass wrapped in paper, by the sworn, statement of Weich
</p>
<p>mann that Mrs. Surratt took with her on that occasion two packages,
</p>
<p>both of which were wrapped in paper, and one of which he describes

</p>
<p>as a small package about six inches in diameter ? The attempt was
</p>
<p>made by calling Mrs. Offut to prove that no such package was de
</p>
<p>livered, but it failed ; she merely states that Mrs . Surratt delivered
</p>
<p>ajaackage wrapped in paper to her after her arrival there, and before
</p>
<p>Lloyd came in, which was laid down in the room. But whether it
</p>
<p>was the package about which Lloyd testifies, or the other package of
</p>
<p>102
</p>
<p>the two about which Weichmann testifies, as having been carried
</p>
<p>there that day by Mrs. Surratt, does not appear. Neither does this
</p>
<p>witness pretend to say that Mrs. Surratt, after she had delivered it
</p>
<p>to her, and the witness had laid it down in the room, did not again
</p>
<p>take it up, if it were the same, and put it in the hands of Lloyd.
</p>
<p>She only knows that she did not see that done; but she did see Lloyd
</p>
<p>with a package like the one she received in the room before Mrs.
</p>
<p>.Surratt left. How it cameinto his possession she is not able to state;
</p>
<p>nor what the package was that Mrs. Surratt first handed her; nor
</p>
<p>which of the packages it was she afterwards saw in the hands of
</p>
<p>Lloyd .
</p>
<p>But there is one other fact in this case that puts forever at rest the
</p>
<p>question of the guilty participation of the prisoner Mrs. Surratt in
</p>
<p>this conspiracy and murder; and that- is that Payne, who had lodged
</p>
<p>four days in her house  who during all that time had sat at her table,
</p>
<p>and who had often conversed with her  when the guilt of his great
</p>
<p>crime was upon him, and he knew not where else he could so safely
</p>
<p>go to find a co-conspirator, and he could trust none that was not like
</p>
<p>himself, guilty, with even the knowledge of his presence  under
</p>
<p>cover of darkness, after Wandering for three days andnights, skulk
</p>
<p>ing before the pursuing- officers of justice, at the hour of midnight,
</p>
<p>found his way to the door of Mrs. Surratt, rang the bell, was admit
</p>
<p>ted, and upon being asked, "Whom do you want to see," replied,
</p>
<p>" Mrs. Surratt." He was then asked by the officer Morgan, what he
</p>
<p>came at that time of night for? to which he replied, " to dig a gutter
</p>
<p>in the morning; Mrs. Surratt had sent for him." Afterwards he said
</p>
<p>"Mrs. Surratt knew he Was a poor man and cametu him." Being
</p>
<p>asked where he last worked ? he replied, " sometimes on ' I' street;"
</p>
<p>aud where he boarded? he replied, "he had no boarding-house, and
</p>
<p>was a poor man who got his living with the pick," which he bore
</p>
<p>upon his shoulder, having stolen it from the intrenchments of the
</p>
<p>capital. Upon being pressed again why he came there at that time
</p>
<p>of night to go to work, he answered that he simply called to see what
</p>
<p>time he should go to work in the morning. Upon being told by the
</p>
<p>officer who fortunately had preceded him to this house that he would

</p>
<p>have to go to the provost marshal's office, he moved and did not
</p>
<p>answer, whereupon Mrs. Surratt was asked to step into the hall and
</p>
<p>state whether she knew this man. Raising her right hand she ex
</p>
<p>claimed, "Before God, sir, I have not seen that man before; I have
</p>
<p>not hired him; I do not know anything about him." The hall was
</p>
<p>brilliantly lighted.
</p>
<p>103
</p>
<p>If not one word had been said, the mere act of Payne in flying
</p>
<p>to her house for shelter would have borne witness against her, strong
</p>
<p>as proofs from Holy Writ. But when she denies, after hearing his
</p>
<p>declarations, that she had sent for him, or that she had gone to him
</p>
<p>and hired him, and calls her God to witness that she had never seen
</p>
<p>him, and knew nothing of him, when, in point of fact, she had seen
</p>
<p>him for four successive days in her own house, in the same clothing
</p>
<p>which he then wore, who can resist for a moment the conclusion that
</p>
<p>these parties were alike guilty?
</p>
<p>The testimony of Spangler' s complicity is conclusive and brief. It
</p>
<p>was impossible to hope for escape after -assassinating the President,
</p>
<p>and such others as might attend him in Ford's theatre, without ar
</p>
<p>rangements being first made to aid- the flight of the assassin and to
</p>
<p>some extent prevent immediate pursuit.
</p>
<p>A stable was to be provided close to Ford's theatre, in which the
</p>
<p>horses could be concealed and kept ready for the assassin's use when
</p>
<p>ever the. murderous blow was struck. Accordingly, Booth secretly,
</p>
<p>.through Maddox, hired a stable in rear of the theatre and connecting
</p>
<p>with it by an alley, as early as the 1st of January last ; showing that
</p>
<p>at that time he had concluded, notwithstanding. all that has been said
</p>
<p>to the contrary, to murder the President \in ..Ford's theatre and pro
</p>
<p>vide the means for immediate and successful flight. Conscious of his
</p>
<p>guilt, he paid the rent for this stable through Maddox, month by
</p>
<p>month, giving him the money. He employed Spangler, doubtless for
</p>
<p>the reason that he could, trust him with the secret, as a carpenter to
</p>
<p>fit up this shed, so that it would furnish room for two horses, and pro
</p>
<p>vided the door with lock and key. , Spangler did this work for him.
</p>
<p>Then, it was necessary that a carpenter having access to the theatre
</p>
<p>should be employed by the assassin to provide a bar for the outer
</p>
<p>door of the passage leading to the/ President' s box, so that when he
</p>
<p>entered upon his work of assassination he would be secure from in
</p>
<p>terruption from therear. By the evidence, it is shown that Spangler
</p>
<p>i was in the box in which the President was murdered on the after
</p>
<p>noon of the 14th of April, and when there damned the President and
</p>
<p>General Grant, and said the President ought to be cursed, he had got

</p>
<p>so many good men killed ; showing not only his hostility to the Presi-
</p>
<p>i dent, but the cause of it  that he had been faithful to his oath and
</p>
<p>had resisted that great rebellion in the interest of which his life was
</p>
<p>labout to be sacrificed by this man and his co-conspirators. In perform
</p>
<p>ing the work which had doubtless been intrusted to him by Booth,
</p>
<p>a mortise was cut in the wall. A wooden bar was prepared, one end
</p>
<p>104
</p>
<p>of which could be readily inserted in the mortise and the other
</p>
<p>pressed against the edge of the door on the inside so as to prevent its
</p>
<p>being opened. Spangler had the skill and the opportunity to do that
</p>
<p>work and all the additional work which was done.
</p>
<p>It is in evidence that the screws in "the keepers" to the locks
</p>
<p>on each of the inner doors of the box occupied, by the President were
</p>
<p>drawn. The attempt has been made, on behalf of the prisoner, to
</p>
<p>show that this was done some time before, accidentally, and with no
</p>
<p>bad design, and had not been repaired by reason of inadvertence;
</p>
<p>but that attempt has utterly failed, because the testimony adduced
</p>
<p>for that purpose relates exclusively to but one of the two inner doors,
</p>
<p>while the fact is, that the screws were drawn in both, and the addi
</p>
<p>tional precaution taken to cut a small hole through one of these doors
</p>
<p>through, which the party approaching arid while in the private pas
</p>
<p>sage would be enabled to look into the box and examine the exact
</p>
<p>posture of the President before entering. It was also deemed essen
</p>
<p>tial, in the execution of this plot, that some one should watch at the
</p>
<p>outer door, in the rear of the theatre, by which alone the assassin
</p>
<p>could hope for escape. It was for this work Booth sought to employ
</p>
<p>Chester in January, offering $3,000 down of the money of his em
</p>
<p>ployers, and the assurance that he should never want. What Ches
</p>
<p>ter refused to do Spangler undertook and promised to do.- When
</p>
<p>Booth brought his horse to the rear door of the theatre, on the even
</p>
<p>ing of the murder, he called for Spangler, who went to him, when
</p>
<p>Booth was heard to say to him, ' ' Ned, you' 11 help me all you can,
</p>
<p>won't you." To which Spangler replied, "Oh, yes."
</p>
<p>When Booth made his escape, it is testified by Colonel Stewart,
</p>
<p>who pursued him across the stage and out through the same door,
</p>
<p>that as he approaehed it some one slammed it shut. Ritterspaugh,
</p>
<p>who was standing behind the scenes when Booth fired the pistol and
</p>
<p>fled, saw Booth run down the passage toward the back door, and pur
</p>
<p>sued him; but Booth drew his knife upon him and passed out, slam
</p>
<p>ming the door after him. Ritterspaiigh opened it and went through,
</p>
<p>leaving it open behind him, leaving Spangler inside, and in a position
</p>
<p>from which he readily could have reached the door. Ritterspaugh

</p>
<p>also states that very quickly after he had passed through this door he
</p>
<p>was followed by a large man, the first who followed him, and who
</p>
<p>was, doubtless, Colonel Stewart. Stewart is very positive that he
</p>
<p>saw this door slammed; that he himself was constrained to open it,
</p>
<p>and had some difficulty in opening it. He also testifies that as he ap
</p>
<p>proached the door a man stood near enough to have thrown it to with,
</p>
<p>105
</p>
<p>his hand, and this man, the witness believes, was the prisoner Span
</p>
<p>gler. Ritterspaugh has sworn that he left the door open behind him
</p>
<p>when he went out, and that he was first followed by the large man,
</p>
<p>Colonel Stewart. Who slammed that door behind Ritterspaugh? It
</p>
<p>was not Ritterspaugh ; it could not have been Booth, for Ritterspaugh
</p>
<p>swears that Booth was mounting his horse at the time; and Stewart
</p>
<p>swears that Booth was upon his horse when he came out. That it was
</p>
<p>Spangler who slammed the door after Ritterspaugh may not only be
</p>
<p>inferred from Stewart' s testimony, hut it is made very clear by his own
</p>
<p>conduct afterwards upon the return of Ritterspaugh to the stage.
</p>
<p>The door being then open, and Ritterspaugh being asked which way
</p>
<p>Booth went, had answered. -Ritterspaugh says: "Then I came back
</p>
<p>on the stage, where I had left Edward Spangler; he hit me on the
</p>
<p>face with his hand and said, 'Don't say which way he went.' I
</p>
<p>asked him what he meant by slapping me in the mouth? He said,
</p>
<p>'For God's sake, shut up.' "
</p>
<p>The testimony of Withers is adroitly handled to throw doubt upon
</p>
<p>these facts. It cannot avail, for' Withers says he was knocked in the
</p>
<p>scene by Booth, and when he "come to" he got a side view of him.
</p>
<p>A man knocked down and senseless, on "coming to" might mistake
</p>
<p>anybody by a side view for Booth.
</p>
<p>An attempt has been made by the defence to discredit this testi
</p>
<p>mony of Ritterspaugh, by showing his contradictory statements to
</p>
<p>Gifford, Carlan, and Lamb,' neither of whom do in fact contradict
</p>
<p>him, but substantially sustain him. None but a guilty man would
</p>
<p>have met the witness with a blow for stating which way the assassin
</p>
<p>had gone. A like confession of guilt was made by Spangler when
</p>
<p>the witness Miles, the same evening, and directly after the assassina
</p>
<p>tion, came to the back door, where Spangler was standing with others,
</p>
<p>and asked Spangler who it was that held the horse; to which Spangler
</p>
<p>replied: "Hush; don't say anything about, it." He confessed his
</p>
<p>guilt again when he denied to Mary Anderson the fact, proved here
</p>
<p>beyond all question, that Booth had called him when he came to that
</p>
<p>door with his horse, Using the emphatic words, " No, he did not; he
</p>
<p>did not call me." The rope comes to bear witness against .him, as

</p>
<p>did the rope which Atzerodt and Herold and John H. Surratt had
</p>
<p>carried to Surrattsville and deposited there with the carbines.
</p>
<p>It is only surprising that the ingenious counsel did not attempt to
</p>
<p>explain the deposit of the rope at Surrattsville by the same method
</p>
<p>that he adopted in explanation of the deposit of this rope, some
</p>
<p>"sixty feet long, found in the carpet-sack of Spangler, unaccounted for
</p>
<p>106
</p>
<p>save by some evidence which tends to show that he may have carried
</p>
<p>it away from the- theatre.
</p>
<p>It is not needful to take time in the recapitulation of the evidence,
</p>
<p>which shows conclusively that David E. Herold was one 'of these con
</p>
<p>spirators. His continued association with Booth, with Atzerodt, his
</p>
<p>visits to Mrs. Surratt' s, his attendance at the theatre with Payne,
</p>
<p>Surratt, and Atzerodt, his connexion with Atzerodt on the evening
</p>
<p>of the murder, riding with him on the street in the direction of and
</p>
<p>near to the theatre at the hour appointed for the work of assassina
</p>
<p>tion, and his final flight and arrest, show that he, in common with all
</p>
<p>the other parties on trial, and all the parties named upon your record
</p>
<p>not upon trial, had combined and confederated to kill and murder in
</p>
<p>the interests of the rebellion, as charged and specified against them.
</p>
<p>That this conspiracy was entered into by all these parties, both
</p>
<p>present and absent, is thus proved by the acts, meetings, declara
</p>
<p>tions, and correspondence of all the parties, beyond any doubt what
</p>
<p>ever. True it is circumstantial evidence, but the court will remember
</p>
<p>the rule before recited, that circumstances cannot lie; that they are
</p>
<p>held sufficient in every court where justice is judicially administered
</p>
<p>to establish the fact of a conspiracy. I shall take no further notice
</p>
<p>of the, remark made by the learned counsel who opened for the defence,
</p>
<p>and which has been followed by several of his associates, that, under
</p>
<p>the Constitution , it requires two witnesses to prove the overt act of high
</p>
<p>treason, than to say, this is not a charge of high treason, but of a treason
</p>
<p>able conspiracy, in aid of a rebellion, with intent to kill and murder
</p>
<p>the executive officer of the United States, and commander of its armies,
</p>
<p>and of the murder of the President in pursuance of that conspiracy,
</p>
<p>and with the intent laid, &c. Neither by the Constitution, nor by
</p>
<p>the rules of the common law, is any fact connected with this allega
</p>
<p>tion required to be established by the testimony of more than one
</p>
<p>witness. I might say, however, that every substantive averment
</p>
<p>against each of the parties named upon this record has been estab
</p>
<p>lished by the testimony of more than one witness.
</p>
<p>That the several accused did enter into this conspiracy with John
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth and John H. Surratt to murder the officers of this gov

<p>ernment named upon the record, in pursuance of the wishes of their
</p>
<p>employers and instigators in Richmond and Canada, and with intent
</p>
<p>thereby to aid the existing rebellion and subvert the Constitution and
</p>
<p>laws of the United States, as alleged, is no longer an open question.
</p>
<p>The intent as laid was expressly declared by Sanders in the meet
</p>
<p>ing of the conspirators at Montreal in February last, by Booth in
</p>
<p>107
</p>
<p>Virginia and New York, and by Thompson to Conover and Mont
</p>
<p>gomery ; but if there were no testimony directly upon this point, the
</p>
<p>law would presume the intent, for the reason that such was the
</p>
<p>natural and necessary tendency and manifest design of the act itself.
</p>
<p>The learned gentleman (Mr. Johnson) says the government has
</p>
<p>survived the assassination of the President, and thereby would have
</p>
<p>you infer that this conspiracy was' not entered into and attempted to
</p>
<p>be executed with the intent laid. With as much show of reason it
</p>
<p>might be said that because the government of the United States has
</p>
<p>survived this unmatched rebellion, it therefore results that the rebel
</p>
<p>conspirators waged war upon the government with no purpose or
</p>
<p>intent thereby to subvert it. By the law we have seen that without
</p>
<p>any direct evidence of previous combination and agreement between
</p>
<p>these parties, the conspiracy might be established by evidence of the
</p>
<p>acts of the prisoners, or' of any others with whom they co-operated,
</p>
<p>concurring in the execution of the common design. (Roscoe, 416.)
</p>
<p>Was there co-operation between the several accused in the exe
</p>
<p>cution of this conspiracy ? That there was is as clearly established
</p>
<p> by the testimony as is the fact that Abraham Lincoln was killed and
</p>
<p>murdered by John Wilkes Booth. The evidence shows that all of
</p>
<p>the accused, save Mudd and Arnold, were in Washington on the 14th
</p>
<p>of April, the day of the assassination, together with John Wilkes
</p>
<p>Booth and John- H. Surratt ; that On that day Booth had a secret
</p>
<p>interview with the prisoner Mary E. Surratt; that immediately there
</p>
<p>after she went to Surrattsville to perform her part of the preparation
</p>
<p>necessary to the successful execution of the conspiracy, and did
</p>
<p>make that preparation ; that John H. Surratt had arrived here from
</p>
<p>Canada, notifying the parties that the price to be paid for this
</p>
<p>great crime had been provided for, at least in part, by the deposit
</p>
<p>receipts of April 6th for $180,000, procured by Thompson of the
</p>
<p>Ontario Bank, Montreal, Canada; that he was also prepared to keep
</p>
<p>watch, or strike a blow, and ready for the contemplated flight; that
</p>
<p>Atzerodt, on the afternoon of that day, was seeking to obtain a horse,
</p>
<p>the better to secure his own safety by flight, after he should have
</p>
<p>performed the task which he had voluntarily undertaken by contract

</p>
<p>in the conspiracy  the murder of Andrew Johnson, then Vice Presi
</p>
<p>dent of the United States; that he did procure a horse for that pur
</p>
<p>pose at Naylor's, and was seen about nine o'clock in the evening to
</p>
<p>ride to the Kirkwood House, where the Vice President then was, dis
</p>
<p>mount and enter. At a previous hour Booth was in the Kirkwood
</p>
<p>108
</p>
<p>House, and left his card, now in evidence, doubtless intended to be
</p>
<p>sent to the room of the Vice-President, and which was in these words:
</p>
<p>"Don't wish to disturb you. Are you at home ? J. Wilkes Booth."
</p>
<p>Atzerodt, when he made application at Brooks's in the afternoon for
</p>
<p>the horse, said to Weichmann, who was there, he was going to ride
</p>
<p>in the country, and that ' ' he was going to get a horse and send for
</p>
<p>Payne." He did get a horse for Payne, as well as for himself; for it
</p>
<p>is proven that on the 12th, he was seen in Washington riding the
</p>
<p>horse which had been procured by Booth, in company with Mudd,
</p>
<p>last November, from Gardner. A similar horse was tied before the
</p>
<p>door of Mr. Seward on the night of the murder, was captured after
</p>
<p>the flight of Payne, who was seen to ride away, and which horse is
</p>
<p>now identified as the Gardner horse. Booth also procured a horse on
</p>
<p>the same day, took it to his stable in the rear of the theatre, where
</p>
<p>he had an interview with Spangler, and where he concealed it.
</p>
<p>Herold, too, obtained a horse in the afternoon, and was seen between
</p>
<p>nine and ten o'clock riding with Atzerodt down the Avenue from the
</p>
<p>Treasury, then up Fourteenth and down F street, passing close by
</p>
<p>Ford's theatre.
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin had come to Washington the day before, had sought
</p>
<p>out his victim (General Grant) at the house of the Secretary of War,
</p>
<p>that he might be able with certainty to identify him, and at the very
</p>
<p>hour when these preparations were going on was lying in wait at
</p>
<p>Rullman's, on the Avenue, keeping watch, and declaring, as he did,
</p>
<p>at about 10 o' clock p. m., when told that the fatal blow had been
</p>
<p>struck by Booth, "I don't believe Booth did it." During the day,
</p>
<p>and the night before, he had been visiting Booth, and doubtless en
</p>
<p>couraging him, and at that very hour was in position, at a convenient
</p>
<p>distance, to aid and protect him in his flight, as well as to execute
</p>
<p>his own part of the conspiracy by inflicting death upon General
</p>
<p>Grant, who happily was not at the theatre nor in the city, having
</p>
<p>left the city that day. Who doubts that, Booth having ascertained
</p>
<p>in the course of the day that General Grant would not be present at
</p>
<p>the theatre, O'Laughlin, who was to murder General Grant, instead
</p>
<p>of entering the box with Booth, was detailed to lie in wait, and watch

</p>
<p>and support him.
</p>
<p>His declarations of his reasons for changing his lodgings here and
</p>
<p>in Baltimore, after the murder, so ably and so ingeniously presented
</p>
<p>in the argument of his learned counsel, (Mr. Cox,) avail nothing
</p>
<p>bofore the blasting fact that he did change his lodgings, and de
</p>
<p>clared "he knew nothing of the affair whatever." O'Laughlin,
</p>
<p>109
</p>
<p>who, lurked here, conspiring daily with Booth and Arnold for
</p>
<p>six weeks to do this murder, declares "he knew nothing of the
</p>
<p>affair." O'Laughlin, who said he was "in the oil business," which
</p>
<p>Booth and Surratt, and Payne and Arnold, have all declared
</p>
<p>meant this conspiracy, says he "knew nothing of the affair."
</p>
<p>O'Laughlin, to whom Booth sent the despatches of the 13th and 27th
</p>
<p>of March  O'Laughlin, who is named in Arriold's letter as one of
</p>
<p>the conspirators, and who searched for General Grant on Thursday
</p>
<p>night, laid in wait for him on Friday, was defeated by that Provi
</p>
<p>dence "which shapes our ends," and laid in wait to aid Booth
</p>
<p>and Payne, declares "he knows nothing of the matter." Such a denial
</p>
<p>is as false and inexcusable as Peter' s denial of our Lord.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Surratt had arrived at home, from the completion of her part
</p>
<p>in the plot, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening. A few
</p>
<p>moments afterwards she was called to the parlor and there had a
</p>
<p>private interview with some one unseen, but whose retreating foot
</p>
<p>steps were heard by the witness Weichmann. This was 'doubtless
</p>
<p>the secret and last visit of John H. Surratt to his mother, who had
</p>
<p>instigated and encouraged him to strike this traitorous and murderous
</p>
<p>blow against his country.
</p>
<p>While all these preparations were going on, Mudd was awaiting
</p>
<p>the execution. of the plot, ready to faithfully perform his part in se
</p>
<p>curing the safe escape of the murderers. Arnold was at his post at
</p>
<p>Fortress Monroe, awaiting the meeting referred to in his letter of
</p>
<p>March 27th, wherein he says they were not "to meet for a month or
</p>
<p>so," which month. had more than expired on the day of the murder,
</p>
<p>for his letter and the testimony disclose that this month of suspension
</p>
<p>began to run from about the first week in March. He stood ready
</p>
<p>with the arms which Booth had furnished him to aid the escape of the
</p>
<p>murderers by that route, and secure their communication with their
</p>
<p>employers. He had given the assurance in that letter to Booth, that
</p>
<p>although the government "suspicioned them," and the undertak
</p>
<p>ing was "becoming complicated," yet "a time more propitious would
</p>
<p>arrive" for the consummation of this conspiracy in which he "was
</p>
<p>one" with Booth, and when he would "be better prepared to again

</p>
<p>be with him."
</p>
<p>Such were the preparations. The horses were in readiness for the
</p>
<p>flight  the ropes were procured, doubtless for the purpose of tying
</p>
<p>the horses at whatever point they might be constrained to delay and
</p>
<p>to secure their boats to their moorings in making their way across the
</p>
<p>Potomac. The five murderous camp knives, the two carbines, the
</p>
<p>110
</p>
<p>eight revolvers, the Derringer, in court and identified, all were ready
</p>
<p>for the work of death. The part that each had played has already
</p>
<p>been in part stated in this argument, and needs no repetition.
</p>
<p>Booth proceeded to the theatre about 9 o'clock in the evening, at
</p>
<p>the same time that Atzerodt and Payne and Herold were riding the
</p>
<p>streets, while Surratt, having parted with his mother at the brief in
</p>
<p>terview in her parlor, from which his retreating steps were heard,
</p>
<p>was walking the Avenue, booted and spurred, and doubtless consult
</p>
<p>ing with O'Laughlin. When Booth reached the rear of the theatre,
</p>
<p>he called Spangler to him, (whose denial of that faot, when charged with
</p>
<p>it, as proven by three witnesses, is very significant,) and received from
</p>
<p>Spangler his pledge to help him all he could, when with Booth he
</p>
<p>entered the theatre by the stage-door, doubtless to see that the way was
</p>
<p>clear from the box to the rear door of the theatre, and look upon their
</p>
<p>victim, whose exact position they could study from the stage. After this
</p>
<p>view, Booth passes to the street, in front of the theatre, where, on
</p>
<p>the pavement with other conspirators yet unknown, among them one
</p>
<p>described as a low-browed villain, he awaits the appointed moment.
</p>
<p>Booth himself, impatient, enters, the vestibule of the theatre from the
</p>
<p>front, and asks the time. He is referred to the clock, and returns.
</p>
<p>Presently, as the hour of 10 o'clock approached, one of his guilty
</p>
<p>associates called the time : they wait ; again, as the moments elapsed,
</p>
<p>this conspirator upon .watch, called the time; again, as the appointed
</p>
<p>hour draws nigh, he calls the time; and finally, when the fatal moment
</p>
<p>arrives, he repeats in a louder tone, "Ten minutes past 10 o'clock."
</p>
<p>Ten minutes past 10 o'clock 1 The hour has come when the red
</p>
<p>right hand of these murderous conspirators should strike, and the
</p>
<p>dreadful- deed of assassination be done.
</p>
<p>Booth, at the appointed moment, entered the theatre, ascended to
</p>
<p>the dress-circle, passed to the right, paused a moment, looking down,
</p>
<p>doubtless to see if Spangler was at his post, and approached the outer
</p>
<p>door of the close passage leading to the box occupied by the Presi
</p>
<p>dent, pressed it open, passed in, and closed the passage door behind
</p>
<p>him. Spangler' s bar was in its place, and was readily adjusted by Booth
</p>
<p>in the mortise, and pressed against the inner side of the door, so that

</p>
<p>he was secure from interruption from without. He passes on to the
</p>
<p>next door, immediately behind the President, and there stopping,
</p>
<p>looks through the aperture in the door into the President's box, and
</p>
<p>deliberately observes the precise position of his victim, seated in the
</p>
<p>chair which had been prepared by the conspirators as the altar for
</p>
<p>the sacrifice, looking calmly and quietly down upon the glad and
</p>
<p>Ill
</p>
<p>grateful people whom by his fidelity he had saved from the peril which
</p>
<p>had threatened the destruction of their government, and all they held
</p>
<p>dear this side of the grave, and whom he had come upon invitation to
</p>
<p>greet with his presence, with the words still lingering upon his lips
</p>
<p>which he had uttered with uncovered head and uplifted hand before
</p>
<p>God and his country, when on the 4th of last March he took again the
</p>
<p>oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, declaring that
</p>
<p>he entered upon the duties of his great office " with malice toward
</p>
<p>none  with charity for all." In a moment more, strengthened by the
</p>
<p>knowledge that his co-conspirators were all. at their posts, seven at
</p>
<p>least of them present in the city, two of them, Mudd and Arnold, at
</p>
<p>their appointed places, watching for his coming, this hired assassin
</p>
<p>moves stealthily through the door, the fastenings of which had been
</p>
<p>removed to facilitate his entrance, fires upon his victim, and the mar

</p>
<p>At the same hour, when these accused and their co-conspirators in
</p>
<p>Richmond and Canada, by the hand of John Wilkes Booth, inflicted
</p>
<p>this mortal wound which deprived the republic of its defender, and

<p>filled this land from ocean to ocean with a strange, great sorrow,

<p>derous hand for a moment paralyzed by the consciousness of guilt,
</p>
<p>he drops his weapons of death, one in the house, the other at the
</p>
<p>door where they were taken up, and are here now to bear witness
</p>
<p>against him. He attempts escape on the horse which Booth and
</p>
<p>Mudd had procured of Gardner  with what success has already been
</p>
<p>stated.
</p>
<p>112
</p>
<p>Atzerodt, near midnight, returns to the stable of Naylor the horse
</p>
<p>which he had procured for this work of murder, having, been inter
</p>
<p>rupted in the execution of the part assigned him at the Kirkwood
</p>
<p>House by the timely coming of citizens to the defence of the Vice
</p>
<p>President, and creeps into the Pennsylvania House at 2 o'clock in the
</p>
<p>morning with another of the conspirators, yet unknown. There he
</p>
<p>remained until about 5 o'clock, when he left, found his way to
</p>
<p>Georgetown, pawned one of his revolvers, now in court, and fled
</p>
<p>northward into Maryland.
</p>
<p>He is traced to Montgomery county, to the house of Mr. Metz, on
</p>
<p>the Sunday succeeding the murder, where, as is proved by the tes
</p>
<p>timony of three witnesses, he said that if the man that was to follow
</p>
<p>General Grant had followed him, it was likely that Grant was shot.
</p>
<p>To one of these witnesses , (Mr. Layman) he said he did not think
</p>
<p>Grant had been killed; or if he had been killed; he was killed by a
</p>
<p>man who got on the cars at the same time that Grant did ; thus dis
</p>
<p>closing most clearly that one of his co- conspirators was assigned the
</p>
<p>task of killing and murdering General Grant, and that Atzerodt knew
</p>
<p>that General Grant had left the city of Washington, a fact which is
</p>
<p>not disputed, on the Friday evening of the murder, by the evening
</p>
<p>train. Thus this intended victim of the conspiracy escaped, for that
</p>
<p>night, the knives and revolvers of Atzerodt, and 0' Laughlin, and Payne,
</p>
<p>and Herold, and Booth, and John H. Surratt, and, perchance, Harper
</p>
<p>and Caldwell, and twenty others, who were then here lying in wait
</p>
<p>for his life.
</p>
<p>In the mean time, Booth and Herold, taking the route before agreed
</p>
<p>upon, make directly after the assassination for the Anacostia bridge.
</p>
<p>Booth crosses first, gives his name, passes the guard, and is speedily
</p>
<p>followed by Herold. They make their way directly to Surrattsville,
</p>
<p>where Herold calls to Lloyd, ' ' Bring out those things, ' ' showing that
</p>
<p>there had been communication between them and Mrs. Surratt after
</p>
<p>her return. Both the carbines being in readiness, according to Mary
</p>
<p>E. Surratt' s directions, both were brought out. They took but one.
</p>
<p>Booth declined to carry the other, saying that his limb was broken.
</p>
<p>They then declared that they had murdered the President and the Sec

<p>retary of State. They then make their way directly to the house of the
</p>
<p>prisoner Mudd, assured of safety and security. They arrived early in
</p>
<p>the morning before day, and no man knows at what hour they left.
</p>
<p>Herold rode towards Bryantown with Mudd about 3 o'clock that after
</p>
<p>noon, in the vicinity of which place he parted with him, remaining in the
</p>
<p>swamp, and was afterwards seen returning the same afternoon in the
</p>
<p>113
</p>
<p>direction of Mudd's house ; about which time, a little before sundown,
</p>
<p>Mudd returned from Bryantown towards his home. This village at
</p>
<p>the time Mudd was in it was thronged with soldiers in pursuit of the
</p>
<p>murderers of the President, and although great care has been taken
</p>
<p>by the defence to deny that any one said in the presence of Dr.
</p>
<p>Mudd, either there or elsewhere on that day, who had committed this
</p>
<p>crime, yet it is in evidence by two witnesses, whose truthfulness no
</p>
<p>nian questions, that upon Mudd's return to his own house, that after
</p>
<p>noon, he stated that Booth was the murderer of the President, and
</p>
<p>Boyle the murderer of Secretary Seward, but took care to make the
</p>
<p>further remark that Booth had brothers, and ha did not know which
</p>
<p>of them had done the act. When did Dr. Mudd learn that Booth
</p>
<p>had brothers ? And what is still more pertinent to this inquiry, from
</p>
<p>whom did he learn that either John Wilkes Booth or any of his
</p>
<p>brothers had murdered the President ? It is clear that Booth remained
</p>
<p>in his house until some time in the afternoon of Saturday ; that
</p>
<p>Herold left the house alone, as one of the witnesses states, being seen
</p>
<p>to pass the windoW; that he alone of these two assassins was in the
</p>
<p>company of Dr. Mudd on his way to Bryantown. It does not appear
</p>
<p>when Herold returned to Mudd' s house. It is a confession of Dr. Mudd
</p>
<p>himself, proven by one of the witnesses, that Booth left his house on
</p>
<p>crutches, and went in the direction of the swamp. How long he re
</p>
<p>mained there, and what became of the horses which Booth and Herold
</p>
<p>rode to his house, and which were put into his stable, are facts no
</p>
<p>where disclosed by the evidence. The owners testify that they have
</p>
<p>never seen the horses since. The accused give no explanation of
</p>
<p>the matter, and when Herold and Booth were captured they had
</p>
<p>not these horses in their possession. How comes it that, on Mudd's
</p>
<p>return from Bryantown, on the evening of Saturday, in his conver-
</p>
<p>' sation with Mr. Hardy and Mr. Farrell, the witnesses before referred
</p>
<p>to, he gave the name of Booth as the murderer of the President and
</p>
<p>that of Boyle as the murderer of Secretary Seward and his son, and
</p>
<p>carefully avoided intimating to either that Booth had come to his
</p>
<p>house early that day, and had remained there until the afternoon ;
</p>
<p>that he left him in his house and had furnished him a razor with

</p>
<p>which Booth attempted to disguise himself by shaving off his mous
</p>
<p>tache? How comes it, also, that, upon being asked by those two
</p>
<p>witnesses whether the Booth who killed the President was the one
</p>
<p>who had been there last fall, he answered that he did not know
</p>
<p>Whether it was that man or one of his brothers, but he understood
</p>
<p>be had some brothers, and added, that 'tf it was the Booth who was

</p>
<p>114
</p>
<p>there last fall, he knew that one, but concealed the fact that this man
</p>
<p>had been at his house on that day and was then at his house, and
</p>
<p>had attempted, in his presence, to disguise his person ? He was
</p>
<p>sorry, very sorry, that the thing had occurred, but not so sorry
</p>
<p>as to be willing to give any evidence to these two neighbors, who
</p>
<p>were manifestly honest and upright men, that the murderer had
</p>
<p>been harbored in his house all day, and was probably at that
</p>
<p>moment, as his own subsequent confession shows, lying concealed
</p>
<p>in his house or near by, subject to his call. This is the man

<p>who undertakes to show by his own declaration, offered in evi
</p>
<p>dence against my protest, of what he said afterwards, on Sunday
</p>
<p>afternoon, the 16th, to his kinsman Dr. George D. Mudd, to whom he
</p>
<p>then stated that the assassination of the President was a most
</p>
<p>damnable act  a conclusion in which most men will agree with him,
</p>
<p>and to establish, which his testimony was not needed. But it is to
</p>
<p>be remarked that this accused did not intimate that the man whom
</p>
<p>he knew the evening before was the murderer had found refuge in
</p>
<p>his house, had disguised his person, and sought concealment in the
</p>
<p>swamp upon the crutches which he had provided for him. Why did
</p>
<p>he conceal this fact from his kinsman ? After the church services
</p>
<p>were over, however, in another conversation on their way home, he
</p>
<p>did tell Dr. George Mudd that two suspicious persons had been at
</p>
<p>his house, who had come there a little before daybreak on Saturday
</p>
<p>morning ; that one of them had a broken leg, which he bandaged ;
</p>
<p>that they got something to eat at his house ; that they seemed to be
</p>
<p>laboring under more excitement than probably would result from the
</p>
<p>injury ; that they said they came from Bryantown, and inquired the
</p>
<p>way to Parson Wilmer's ; that while at his house one of them called
</p>
<p>for a razor and shaved himself. The witness says, " I do not remem
</p>
<p>ber whether he said that this party shaved off his whiskers or his ,
</p>
<p>moustache, but he altered somewhat, or probably materially, his fea- .
</p>
<p>tures." Finally, the prisoner, Dr. Mudd, told this witness that he,
</p>
<p>in company with the younger of the two men, went down the road
</p>
<p>towards Bryantown in search of a vehicle to take the wounded man
</p>
<p>away from his house. How comes it that he concealed in this con

</p>
<p>versation the fact proved, that he went with Herold towards Bryan- (
</p>
<p>town and left Herold outside of the town ? How comes it that in this.
</p>
<p>second conversation, on Sunday, insisted upon here with such perti-,;
</p>
<p>nacity as evidence for the defence, but which had never been called^
</p>
<p>for by the prosecution, he concealed from his kinsman the fact which,
</p>
<p>he had disclosed the day before to Hardy and Farrell, that it was^
</p>
<p>115
</p>
<p>Booth who assassinated the President, and the fact which is now dis
</p>
<p>closed by his other confessions given in evidence for the prosecution,
</p>
<p>that it was Booth whom he had sheltered, concealed in his house, and
</p>
<p>aided to his hiding place in the swamp ? He volunteers as evidence
</p>
<p>his further statement, however, to this witness, that on Sunday eve
</p>
<p>ning he requested the witness to state to the military authorities that
</p>
<p>two suspicious persons had been at his house, and see if anything
</p>
<p>could be made of it. He did not tell the witness what became of
</p>
<p>Herold, and where he parted with him on the way to Bryantown.
</p>
<p>How comes it that when he was in Bryantown on the Saturday eve
</p>
<p>ning before, when he knew that Booth was then at his house, and
</p>
<p>that Booth was the murderer of the President, he did not himself
</p>
<p>state it to the military authorities then in that village, as he Well
</p>
<p>knew ? It is difficult to see what kindled his suspicions on Sunday,
</p>
<p>if none were in his mind on Saturday, when he was in possession of
</p>
<p>the fact that Booth had murdered the President, and was then secre
</p>
<p>ting arid disguising himself in the prisoner's own house.
</p>
<p>His conversation with Gardner on the same Sunday at the church
</p>
<p>is also introduced, here to relieve him from the overwhelming evi
</p>
<p>dences of his guilt. He communicates nothing to Gardner of the
</p>
<p>fact that Booth had been in his house ; nothing of the fact that he
</p>
<p>knew the day before that Booth had murdered the President ; nothing
</p>
<p>-of the fact that Booth had disguised or attempted to disguise himself ;
</p>
<p>'nothing of the fact that he had gone with Booth's associate, Herold,
</p>
<p>L'in search of a vehicle, the more speedily to expedite their flight ;
</p>
<p>nothing of the fact that Booth had found concealment in the woods
</p>
<p>and swamp near his house, upon the crutches which he had furnished
</p>
<p>him. He contents himself with merely stating "that we ought to
</p>
<p>raise immediately a home guard, to hunt up all suspicious persons
</p>
<p>passing through our section of country and arrest them, for there
</p>
<p>were two suspicious persons at my house yesterday morning."
</p>
<p>It would have looked more like aiding justice and arresting felons
</p>
<p>if he had put in execution his project of a home guard on Saturday,
</p>
<p>and made it effective by the arrest of the man then in his house who
</p>
<p>had lodged with him last fall, with whom he had gone to purchase

<p>one of the very horses employed in this flight after the assassination,
</p>
<p>1 whom he had visited last winter in Washington, and to whom he had
</p>
<p>^pointed out the very route by which he had escaped by way of his
</p>
<p>house whom he had again visited on the 3d of last March, prepara
</p>
<p>tory to the commission of this great crime, and who he knew, when
</p>
<p>he sheltered and concealed him in the woods on Saturday, was not
</p>
<p>116
</p>
<p>merely a suspicious person, but was, in fact, the murderer and assassin
</p>
<p>of Abraham Lincoln. While I deem it my duty to say here, as I said
</p>
<p>before, when these declarations uttered by the accused on Sunday,
</p>
<p>the 16th, to Gardner and George D. Mudd, were attempted to be
</p>
<p>offered on the part of the accused, that they are in no sense evi
</p>
<p>dence, and by the law were wholly inadmissible, yet I s tate it as my
</p>
<p>conviction that, being upon the record upon motion of the accused
</p>
<p>himself, so far as these declarations to Gardner and George D. Mudd
</p>
<p>go, they are additional indications of the guilt of the accused, in
</p>
<p>this, that they are manifestly suppressions of the truth and sugges
</p>
<p>tions of falsehood and deception ; they are but the utterances and
</p>
<p>confessions of guilt.
</p>
<p>To Lieutenant Lovett, Joshua Lloyd, and Simon Gavican, who, in
</p>
<p>pursuit of the murderer, visited his house on the 18th of April, the
</p>
<p>Tuesday after the murder, he denied positively, upon inquiry, that
</p>
<p>two men had passed his house, or had come to his house on the
</p>
<p>morning after the assassination. Two of these witnesses swear posi
</p>
<p>tively to his having made the denial, and the other says he hesitated
</p>
<p>to answer the question he put to him ; all of them agree that he
</p>
<p>afterwards admitted that two men had been there, one of whom had
</p>
<p>a broken limb, which he had set; arid when asked by this witness
</p>
<p>who that man was, he said he did not know  that the man was a
</p>
<p>stranger to him, and that the two had been there but a short time.
</p>
<p>Lloyd asked him if he had ever seen any of the parties, Booth,
</p>
<p>Herold and Surratt, and he said he had never seen them; while it
</p>
<p>is positively proved that he was acquainted with John H. Surratt,
</p>
<p>who had been in his house ; that he knew Booth, and had introduced
</p>
<p>Booth to Surratt last winter. Afterwards, on Friday, the 21st, he ad
</p>
<p>mitted to Lloyd that he had been introduced to Booth last fall,
</p>
<p>and, that this man, who came to his house on Saturday, the 15th, re
</p>
<p>mained there from about 4 o'clock in the morning until about 4 in the
</p>
<p>afternoon; that one of them left his house on horseback, and the other
</p>
<p>walking. In the first conversation he denied ever having seen these
</p>
<p>men. Colonel Wells also testifies that, in his conversation with Dr. Mudd
</p>
<p>on Friday, the 21st, the prisoner said that he had gone to Bryan

</p>
<p>town, or near Bryantown, to see some friends on Saturday, and that
</p>
<p>as he came back to his own house he saw the person he afterwards
</p>
<p>supposed to be Herold passing to the left of his house towards the
</p>
<p>barn, but that he did not see the other person at all after he left him
</p>
<p>in his own house, about 1 o'clock. If this statement be true, how
</p>
<p>117
</p>
<p>did Dr. Mudd see the same person leave his house on crutches ? He
</p>
<p>further stated to this witness that he returned to his own house about
</p>
<p>4 o'clock in the afternoon; that he did not know this wounded man;
</p>
<p>said he could not recognize him from the photograph which is of
</p>
<p>record here, but admitted that he had met Booth some time in No
</p>
<p>vember, when he had some conversation with him about lands and
</p>
<p>horses; that Booth had remained with him that night in November,
</p>
<p>and on the next day had purchased a horse. He said he had not
</p>
<p>again seen Booth from the time of the introduction in November up
</p>
<p>to his arrival at his house on the Saturday morning after the assas
</p>
<p>sination. Is not this a confession that he did see John Wilkes Booth
</p>
<p>on that morning at his house, and knew it was Booth ? If he did not
</p>
<p>know him, how came he to make this statement to the witness : that
</p>
<p>"be had not seen Booth after November prior to his arrival there
</p>
<p>on the Saturday morning?"
</p>
<p>He had said before to the same witness, he did not knOw the
</p>
<p>wounded man. He said further to Colonel Wells, that when he went
</p>
<p>up stairs after their arrival, he noticed that the person he supposed to
</p>
<p>be Booth had shaved off his moustache. Is it not inferable from this
</p>
<p>declaration that he then supposed him to be Booth ? Yet he declared
</p>
<p>the same afternoon, and while Booth was in his own house, that Booth
</p>
<p>was the murderer of the President. One of the most remarkable
</p>
<p>statements made to this witness by the prisoner was that he heard for
</p>
<p>the first time on Sunday morning, or late in the evening of Saturday,
</p>
<p>that the President had been murdered ! From whom did he hear
</p>
<p>it? The witness (Colonel Wells) volunteers his "impression" that
</p>
<p>Dr. Mudd had said he had heard it after the persons had left his
</p>
<p>house. If the ' ' impression' ' of the witness thus volunteered is to be
</p>
<p>taken as evidence  and the counsel for the accused, judging from their
</p>
<p>manner, seem to think it ought to be  let this question be answered :
</p>
<p>how could Dr. Mudd have made that impression upon anybody truth
</p>
<p>fully, when it is proved by Farrell and Hardy that on his return
</p>
<p>from Bryantown, on Saturday afternoon, he not only stated that the
</p>
<p>j President Mr. Seward and his son had been assassinated, but that
</p>
<p>Boyle had assassinated Mr. Seward, and Booth had assassinated the

</p>
<p>President ? Add to this the fact that he said to this witness that he left
</p>
<p>his own house at 1 o' clock, and when he returned the men were gone,
</p>
<p>yet it is in evidence, by his own declarations, that Booth left his house
</p>
<p>at four o' clock on crutches, and he must have been there to have seen
</p>
<p>it, or he could not have known the fact.
</p>
<p>Mr. Williams testifies that he was at Mudd's house on Tuesday, the
</p>
<p>118
</p>
<p>18th of April, when he said that strangers had not been that Way, and
</p>
<p>also declared that he heard, for the first time, of the assassination of
</p>
<p>the President on Sunday morning, at church. Afterwards, on Friday,
</p>
<p>the 21st, Mr. Williams asked him concerning the men who had been at
</p>
<p>his house, one of whom had a broken limb, and he confessed they had
</p>
<p>been there. Upon being asked if they were Booth and Herold, he
</p>
<p>said they were not  that he knew Booth. I think it is fair to conclude
</p>
<p>that he did know Booth, when we consider the testimony of Weich
</p>
<p>mann, of Norton, of Evans, and all the testimony just referred to,
</p>
<p>wherein he declares, himself, that he not only knew him, but that he
</p>
<p>had lodged With him, and that he had himself gone with him when
</p>
<p>he purchased his horse from Gardner last fall, for the very purpose
</p>
<p>of aiding the flight of himself, or some of his confederates.
</p>
<p>All these circumstances taken together, which, as we have seen
</p>
<p>upon high authority, are stronger as evidences of guilt than even di
</p>
<p>rect testimony, leave no further room for argument, and no rational
</p>
<p>doubt that Doctor Samuel A. Mudd was as certainly in this conspiracy
</p>
<p>as were Booth and Herold, whom he sheltered and entertained; re
</p>
<p>ceiving them under cover of darkness on the morning after the assas
</p>
<p>sination, concealing them throughout that day from the hand of of
</p>
<p>fended justice, and aiding them, by every endeavor, to pursue their
</p>
<p>way successfully to their co-conspirator, Arnold, at Fortress Monroe,
</p>
<p>and in which direction they fled until overtaken and Booth was slain .
</p>
<p>We next find Herold and his confederate Booth, after their de
</p>
<p>parture from the house of Mudd, across the Potomac in the neigh
</p>
<p>borhood of Port Conway, on Monday, the 24th of April, conveyed in
</p>
<p>a wagon. There Herold, in order to obtain the aid of Captain Jett,
</p>
<p>Ruggles, and Bai'nbridge, of the confederate army, said to Jett, " We
</p>
<p>are the assassinators of the President ;" that this was his brother
</p>
<p>with him, who, with himself, belonged to A. P. Hill's corps; that
</p>
<p>his brother had been wounded at Petersburg ; that their names were
</p>
<p>Boyd. Ee requested Jett and his rebel companions to take them
</p>
<p>out of the lines. After this Booth joined these parties, was placed
</p>
<p>on Ruggles' s horse, and crossed the Rappahannock river. They
</p>
<p>then proceeded to the house of Garrett, in the neighborhood of Port

</p>
<p>Royal, and nearly midway between Washington city and Fortress
</p>
<p>Monroe, where they were to have joined Arnold. Before these rebel
</p>
<p>guides and guards parted with them, Herold confessed that they were
</p>
<p>travelling under assumed names  that his own name was Herold, and
</p>
<p>that the name of the wounded man was John Wilkes Booth, "who
</p>
<p>had killed the President." The rebels left Booth at Garrett's, where
</p>
<p>119
</p>
<p>Herold revisited him from time to time, until they were captured
</p>
<p>At 2 o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 26th, a party of United
</p>
<p>States officers and soldiers surrounded Garrett's barn where Booth
</p>
<p>and Herold lay concealed, and demanded their surrender. Booth
</p>
<p>cursed Herold, calling him a coward, and bade him go, when Herold
</p>
<p>came out and surrendered himself, was taken into custody, and is
</p>
<p>now brought into court. The barn was then set on fire, when Booth
</p>
<p>sprang to his feet, amid the flames that were kindling about him,
</p>
<p>carbine in hand, and approached the door, seeking, by the flashing
</p>
<p>light of the fire, to find some new victim for his murderous hand,
</p>
<p>when he was shot, as he deserved to be, by Sergeant Corbett, in
</p>
<p>order to save his comrades from wounds or death by the hands of
</p>
<p>this desperate assassin. Upon his person was found the following
</p>
<p>bill of exchange :
</p>
<p>"No. 1492. The Ontario Bank, Montreal Branch. Exchange
</p>
<p>for ,61 12s. IOcL Montreal, 27th October, 1864. Sixty days after
</p>
<p>sight of this first of exchange, second and third of the same tenor
</p>
<p>and date, pay to the order of J. Wilkes Booth 61 12s. lOd. sterling,
</p>
<p>value received, and charge to the account of this office. H. Stanus,
</p>
<p>manager. To Messrs. Glynn, Mills & Co., London."
</p>
<p>Thus fell, by the hands of one of the defenders of the republic, this
</p>
<p>hired assassin, who, for a price, murdered Abraham Lincoln, bearing
</p>
<p>upon his person, as this bill of exchange testifies, additional evidence
</p>
<p>of the fact that he had undertaken, in aid of the rebellion, this work
</p>
<p>of assassination by the hands of himself and his confederates, for such
</p>
<p>sum as the accredited agents of Jefferson Davis might pay him or
</p>
<p>them, out of the funds of the confederacy, which, as is in evidence,
</p>
<p>they had in ','any amount" in Canada for the purpose of rewarding
</p>
<p>.conspirators, spies, poisoners, and assassins, who might take service
</p>
<p>under their false commissions, and do the work of the incendiary and
</p>
<p>the murderer upon the lawful representatives of the American people,
</p>
<p>' to whom had been intrusted the care of the republic, the mainten
</p>
<p>ance of the Constitution, and the execution of the laws.

<p>The court will remember that it is in the testimony of Merritt and

<p>and Cleary, made their boasts that they had money in Canada for this
</p>
<p>very purpose. Nor is it to be overlooked or forgotten that the officers
</p>
<p>of the Ontario Bank at Montreal testify that during the current year
</p>
<p>of this conspiracy and assassination Jacob Thompson had on deposit
</p>
<p>in that bank the sum of six hundred and forty -nine thousand dollars,
</p>
<p>and that these deposits to the credit of Jacob Thompson accrued
</p>
<p>120
</p>
<p>from the negotiation of bills of exchange drawn by the Secretary of
</p>
<p>the Treasury of the so-called Confederate States on Frazier, Trenholm
</p>
<p>& Co., of Liverpool, who were known to be the financial agents of the
</p>
<p>Confederate States. With an undrawn deposit in this bank of four
</p>
<p>hundred and fifty -five dollars, which has remained to his credit since
</p>
<p>October last, and with an unpaid bill of exchange drawn by the same
</p>
<p>bank upon London, in his possession and found upon his person, Booth
</p>
<p>ends his guilty career in this work of conspiracy and blood in April,
</p>
<p>1865, as he began it in October, 1864, in combination with Jefferson
</p>
<p>Davis, Jacob Thompson, George N. Sanders, Clement C. Clay, Wil
</p>
<p>liam C. Cleary, Beverley Tucker, and other co-conspirators, making
</p>
<p>use of the money of the rebel confederation to aid in the execution
</p>
<p>and in the flight, bearing at the moment of his death upon his person
</p>
<p>their money, part of the price which they paid for his great crime,
</p>
<p>to aid him in its consummation, and secure him afterwards from
</p>
<p>arrest and the just penalty which by the law of God and the law of
</p>
<p>man is denounced against treasonable conspiracy and murder.
</p>
<p>By all the testimony in the case it is, in my judgment, made as clear
</p>
<p>as any transaction can be shown by human testimony, that John
</p>
<p>Wilkes Booth and John H. Surratt, and the several accused, David E.
</p>
<p>Herold, George A. Atzerodt, Lewis Payne, Michael O'Laughlin, Ed
</p>
<p>ward Spangler, Samuel Arnold, Mary E. Surratt, and Samuel A. Mudd,

<p>and thereafter, combine, confederate, and conspire with Jefferson

<p>his accredited agents in Canada, of this treasonable conspijftcy.
</p>
<p>It is also submitted to the court, that it is clearly established by
</p>
<p>the testimony that John Wilkes Booth, in pursuance of this conspi
</p>
<p>racy, so entered into by him and the accused, did, on the night of
</p>
<p>the 14th of April, 1865, within the military department of Washington,

<p>121
</p>
<p>and the intrenched fortifications and military lines thereof, and with
</p>
<p>the intent laid, inflict a mortal wound upon Abraham Lincoln, then
</p>
<p>President and Commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United
</p>
<p>States, whereof he died; that in pursuance of the same conspiracy
</p>
<p>and within the said department and intrenched lines, Lewis Payne
</p>
<p>assaulted, with intent to kill and murder, William H. Seward, then
</p>
<p>Secretary of State of the United States; that George A. Atzerodt, in
</p>
<p>pursuance of the same conspiracy, and within the said department,
</p>
<p>laid in wait, with intent to kill and murder Andrew Johnson, then
</p>
<p>Vice President of the United States; that Michael O'Laughlin, within
</p>
<p>said department, and in pursuance of said conspiracy, laid in wait to
</p>
<p>kill and murder Ulysses S. Grant, then in command of the armies of
</p>
<p>the United States; and that Mary E. Surratt, David E. Herold,
</p>
<p>Samuel Arnold, Samuel A. Mudd, and Edward Spangler did en
</p>
<p>courage, aid, and abet the commission of said several acts in the
</p>
<p>prosecution of said conspiracy.
</p>
<p>If this treasonable conspiracy has not been wholly executed ; if the
</p>
<p>several executive officers of the United States and the commander of
</p>
<p>its armies, to kill and murder whom the said several accused thus con
</p>
<p>federated and conspired, have not each and all fallen by the hands of
</p>
<p>these conspirators, thereby leaving the people of the United States
</p>
<p>without a President or Vice President; without a Secretary of State,
</p>
<p>who alone is clothed with authority by the law to call an election to
</p>
<p>fill the vacancy, should any arise, in the offices of President and Vice
</p>
<p>President; and without a lawful commander of the armies of the re
</p>
<p>public, it is only because the conspirators were deterred by the vigi
</p>
<p>lance and fidelity of the executive officers, whose lives were merci
</p>
<p>fully protected on that night of murder by the care of the Infinite

<p>Being who has thus far saved the republic and crowned its arms with

<p>victory. If this conspiracy was thus entered into by the accused; if John

<p>Wilkes Booth did kill and murder Abraham Lincoln in pursuance

<p>thereof; if Lewis Payne did, in pursuance of said conspiracy, assault

<p>with intent to kill and murder William H. Seward, as stated, and if

<p>the several parties accused did commit the several acts alleged against

<p>them in*Le prosecution of said conspiracy, then, it is the law that

<p>all the parties to that conspiracy, whether present at the time of its
</p>
<p>execution or not, whether on trial before this court or not, are alike
</p>
<p>guilty of the several acts done by each in the execution of the com

<p>mon design.. What these conspirators did in the execution of this
</p>
<p>conspiracy by the hand of one of their co-'conspirators they did them-

<p>selves ; his act., done in the prosecution of the common design, was
</p>
<p>the act of all the parties to the treasonable combination, because done
</p>
<p>in execution and furtherance of their guilty and treasonable agree
</p>
<p>ment. ,
</p>
<p>As we have seen, this is- the rule, whether all the conspirators are
</p>
<p>indicted or not ; whether they are all on trial or not. "It is not
</p>
<p>material what the nature of the indictment is, provided the offence
</p>
<p>involve a conspiracy. Upon indictment for murder, for instance, if
</p>
<p>it appear that others, together with the prisoner, conspired to per
</p>
<p>petrate the crime, the act of one done in pursuance of that intention
</p>
<p>world be evidence against the rest." (1 Whar., 706.) To the same
</p>
<p>effect are the words of Chief Justice Marshall, before cited, that who- I
</p>
<p>ever leagued in a general conspiracy, performed any part, however
</p>
<p>minute, or however remote, from the scene of action, are guilty as
</p>
<p>principals. In this treasonable conspiracy, to aid the existing armed
</p>
<p>rebellion, by murdering the executive officers of the United States
</p>
<p>and the commander of its armies, all the parties to it must be held as
</p>
<p>principals, and the act of one in the prosecution of the common design
</p>
<p>the act of all.
</p>
<p>I leave the decision of this dread issue with the court, to which
</p>
<p>alone it belongs. It is for you to say, upon your oaths, whether the
</p>
<p>accused are guilty.
</p>
<p>I am not conscious that in this argument I have made any erro
</p>
<p>neous statement of the evidence, er drawn any erroneous conclusions;
</p>
<p>yet I pray the court, out of tender regard and jealous care for the
</p>
<p>rights of the accused, to see that no error Of mine, if any there be,
</p>
<p>shall work them harm. The past services of the members of, this
</p>
<p>honorable court give assurance that, without fear, favor, or affection,
</p>
<p>they will discharge with fidelity the duty enjoined upon them by
</p>
<p>their oaths. Whatever else may befall, I trust in God that in this, as .
</p>
<p>in every other American court, the rights of the whole people will
</p>
<p>be respected, and that the Republic in this, its supreme hour of trial,
</p>
<p>will be true to itself and just to all  ready to protect the rights of
</p>
<p>the humblest, to redress every wrong, to avenge every crime, to
</p>
<p>vindicate the majesty of law, and to maintain inviolate the Constitu-
