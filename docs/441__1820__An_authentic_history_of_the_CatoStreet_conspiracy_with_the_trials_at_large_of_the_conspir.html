<p>PREFACE.
</p>
<p>lO those, who are accustomed to look with an
</p>
<p>observant eye upon the causes which lead to the
</p>
<p>fall and destruction of nations, the present epoch
</p>
<p>ofiers materials for their most weighty considera-
</p>
<p>tion, i hey have seen their country involved in
</p>
<p>one of the most destructive and arduous contests
</p>
<p>ever recorded in its annals ; they have seen the
</p>
<p>combined force of the civilized world directed
</p>
<p>against its very existence ; they have witnessed its
</p>
<p>unexampled and glorious struggle ; the loyalty
</p>
<p>and patriotism of the people, and finally they
</p>
<p>have behehl it, rising at the close of the contest,
</p>
<p>not subdued nor conquered, but towering with
</p>
<p>renovated fame and lustre, and scattering to their
</p>
<p>loathsome dens the dark demons of anarchy and
</p>
<p>ruin ; they beheld the industrious artisan return-
</p>
<p>ing to the shuttle  the laborious peasant to the
</p>
<p>plough  the war-worn soldier was seated at his
</p>
<p>native hearth telling the story of his battles, and
</p>
<p>the weather-beaten sailor, in the fulness of his
</p>
<p>pride, was glorying in the wounds obtained in the
</p>
<p>defence of his country. Peace gave to the nation
</p>
<p>its blessings, and round the consecrated altars of
</p>
<p>our fathers knelt the children of this favoured
</p>
<p>land in grateful prayer to that Ciod, who had gone

<p>forth with them in the day of battle ; and who, in
</p>
<p>the wreck of surrounding kingdoms, had vouch-
</p>
<p>safed to spread over this his protecting hand.
</p>
<p>But, in the midst of these cheering prospects, the
</p>
<p>pestilential air of Atheism and Infidelity was
</p>
<p>raging abroad like the blasting heat of the Simoon
</p>
<p>in the desert, and throwing its sickening hue over
</p>
<p>the beautiful forms of Religion and Virtue. Men,
</p>
<p>if such an exalted name can be given them, who
</p>
<p>have openly thrown off all submission  all re-
</p>
<p>verence  all duty and love to their God ; who, in
</p>
<p>the most blasphemous manner, had reviled and
</p>
<p>denied their divine Redeemer, considered them-
</p>
<p>selves enfranchised from every moral and religious
</p>
<p>duty, from allegiance to their earthly Sovereign
</p>
<p>and obedience to the laws of the country. In the
</p>
<p>latter they beheld an irksome^ and disagreeable
</p>
<p>restraint upon the exercise of their degenerate
</p>
<p>passions, they tore themselves away from the
</p>
<p>great human Society, despised its relations and its
</p>
<p>duties, and in their midnight assemblies traitor-
</p>
<p>ously plotted the massacre of some of the most
</p>
<p>exalted individuals of the country. In themselves
</p>
<p>they united the dreadful characters of traitor, in-
</p>
<p>cendiary, and murderer. Apostates from their reli-
</p>
<p>gion, a spirit of horrible infidelity hardened their
</p>
<p>hearts against all the tender feelings of humanity
</p>
<p>and virtue, blinded their understandings to the
</p>
<p>dictates of truth, and rendered them capable of the
</p>
<p>vilest crimes. But the eye of Providence watched
</p>
<p>over their victims in the dark recesses where their

<p>Being marked their actions, and, at the verj mo-
</p>
<p>ment of their expected accomplishment, dragged
</p>
<p>them forth to the execration and vengeance of
</p>
<p>their injured country.
</p>
<p>We live in times teeming with events of such
</p>
<p>uncommon magnitude, that they seem to laugh to
</p>
<p>scorn all that we used to call important in our
</p>
<p>former history. Let us not deceive ourselves. It
</p>
<p>is no petty danger that threatens us ; we are not
</p>
<p>anxious about some dubious point of honour, nor
</p>
<p>are we contending for any secondary interest; but
</p>
<p>for the very body and substance of our Island :
</p>
<p>not for the foHage, nor even the branches, but
</p>
<p>for the trunk of the British Oak; that Oak so dif-
</p>
<p>ferent in all respects from the Tree of Liberty,
</p>
<p>intended to be reared in the Country by certain
</p>
<p>pretended Patriots ; that Oak beneath which a
</p>
<p>grateful and a happy people had so long sheltered ;
</p>
<p>and under which the distressed of other countries
</p>
<p>have often found a refuge, Mhen driven to seek
</p>
<p>protection from the stormy blasts in their own
</p>
<p>less happy land.
</p>
<p>But to what are the temporal evils which now
</p>
<p>afflict the country to be traced ? Undoubtedly to
</p>
<p>apostacy in religion, and to the alarming growth
</p>
<p>of infidelity and deism. Conspirators never found
</p>
<p>an asylum in the habitations of Christians. The
</p>
<p>roll of turbulent revolters that History has re-
</p>
<p>corded and transmitted to us, as the assertors of
</p>
<p>the Rights of Men, exhibits not one disciple of the
</p>
<p>meek and lowly Jesus. The true believer in the

<p>VI Pit El ACE.
</p>
<p>the picture exhibited of the real Christian,
</p>
<p>grounded still stronger upon the sure foundation
</p>
<p>of his faith upon the solid rock of this heavenly
</p>
<p>dispensation. His soul catches new fire from
</p>
<p>the host of examples which Christian History re-
</p>
<p>cords : he shudders at the attempts which are
</p>
<p>made by proud and factious men to withdraw
</p>
<p>subjects from their allegiance, to plunge them
</p>
<p>into the horrors of anarchy and civil war; he
</p>
<p>trembles with astonishment and indignation, when
</p>
<p>men rejoice over the mangled remains of Princes
</p>
<p>and of statesmen, and over the bloody corpses of
</p>
<p>Sovereigns butchered by the hands of their own
</p>
<p>rebellious subjects. It is to the progress of irre-
</p>
<p>ligion and the decay of morals, that the increase
</p>
<p>of crime which now stigmatises the country, is to
</p>
<p>be attributed. It is to the fatal neglect of their
</p>
<p>religious duties, and to the renunciation of the
</p>
<p>blessings which Christianity offers them, that the
</p>
<p>miserable men, whose dreadful acts are recorded
</p>
<p>in the following pages, have been doomed to
</p>
<p>expiate their crimes on the scaffold. Religion
</p>
<p>does not leave the interests of mankind within
</p>
<p>the contracted circle of his social duties: its
</p>
<p>influence is extended in its protection to the
</p>
<p>utmost possible degree. The Christian is not
</p>
<p>only obliged by his profession to be a good man,
</p>
<p>but also to be a good citizen. lie must be
</p>
<p>obedient to the governing powers under which
</p>
<p>he is born and placed. No subtilty of reasoning,
</p>
<p>nor any perversion of language or texts of Scrip-

</p>
<p>against his Iiua fnl Sovereign. Whenever, indeed,
</p>
<p>the standard uf rebdiiou is unfortunately lifted
</p>
<p>up against our Prince, it is the duty of the
</p>
<p>Christian to be active in his allegiance, and to
</p>
<p>defend the Government to which he belongs, with
</p>
<p>all possible energy.
</p>
<p>It has, however, pleased an Almighty Provi-
</p>
<p>dence to protect the Rulers of this Country from
</p>
<p>the diabolical machinations of a set of lawless
</p>
<p>wretches who sought to erect their own interest
</p>
<p>on murder, rapine, and treason. Their names
</p>
<p>are transmittted to posterity, branded with th(>
</p>
<p>most horrible crimes that disfigure human nature ;
</p>
<p>their lives are forfeited to the injured Laws of
</p>
<p>their Country: and, although they may have
</p>
<p>attempted to console themselves with the vain
</p>
<p>belief that the punishment for their deeds ends in
</p>
<p>this world, the dread reality has now flashed upon
</p>
<p>them that there is also another world in which
</p>
<p>the hardeiied and unrepentant sinner will meet
</p>
<p>his everlasting doom.
</p>
<p>To the Atheist and the Infidel let the blood of
</p>
<p>these men speak with the most solemn admo-
</p>
<p>nition. The time is fast approaching when the
</p>
<p>veil of earthly things will be removed from iheii
</p>
<p>sight; when the cobweb texture of their fancied
</p>
<p>theories will be torn asunder ; and truth, with its
</p>
<p>radiant liglit, burst upon them. 'Ilien let them
</p>
<p>pause, ere it be too late: a dreadful example has

<p>been set before them of the effect of irreligion

<p>ADDRESS.
</p>
<p>Among all the wild, wicked, and visionary
</p>
<p>schemes of which we have seen the rise and fall,
</p>
<p>in this age of infidelity and disaffection, none
</p>
<p>can be compared with that of which we are
</p>
<p>about to give the frightful history, for extrava-
</p>
<p>gance in its origin, ferocity in its details, or fiend-
</p>
<p>like triumph in its anticipated consummation. It
</p>
<p>is an event which must for ever bluLwith disgrace
</p>
<p>the fair page of British history, and it exhibits an
</p>
<p>awful and humiliating view of the state of degra-
</p>
<p>dation to which the human mind may be brought,
</p>
<p>when once it has cast off the fear of God, as in-
</p>
<p>culcated in the divine precepts of Christianity.
</p>
<p>The present work professes to be an authentic
</p>
<p>and digested history of the rise, progress, disco-
</p>
<p>very, and termination of the atrocious Cato- street
</p>
<p>Conspiracy; interspersed with so much of the
</p>
<p>personal history of the individuals concerned, as
</p>
<p>may be necessary to illustrate the principle which

</p>
<p>it is the main object of this work to inculcatet
</p>
<p>namely, that to the abandonment of the duties ot
</p>
<p>our holy religion alone, is it to be attributed that
</p>
<p>we have men among us wicked enough to conceive,
</p>
<p>and others so weak as to assist in, such prepos-
</p>
<p>terous and atrocious schemes.
</p>
<p>The first part contains the history of the plot ;
</p>
<p>its detection ; the murder of Smithers, the peace-
</p>
<p>officer, in the execution of his duty ; particulars
</p>
<p>of the subsequent arrests; 'all the proceedings
</p>
<p>before the Police Magistrates, and the Privy Coun-
</p>
<p>cil; and a full and accurate description of the
</p>
<p>horrid weapons of destruction, and infernal com-
</p>
<p>bustible machines, intended to be used by this de-
</p>
<p>testable gang of assassins.
</p>
<p>The second part contains, at great length, the
</p>
<p>Trials of all the executed conspirators, and the
</p>
<p>disposal of the other persons arrested, with a
</p>
<p>variety of additional particulars relative to the
</p>
<p>plot. The accounts of the execution, and deca-
</p>
<p>pitation, which are given witli great correctness
</p>
<p>and fidelity, will be found interesting and affect-
</p>
<p>ing, and the Appendix contains sketches of the
</p>
<p>lives and conduct of the executed criminals, to

</p>
<p>On the morning of Thursday the 24th of
</p>
<p>February 1820, the metropolis was thrown into
</p>
<p>the greatest consternation and alarm, by the
</p>
<p>intelligence, that, in the course of the preceding

<p>but which, by the prompt measures directed by the

<p>privy council, who remained sitting the greatest

<p>part of night, had been happily destroyed by the

<p>arrest and dispersion of the conspirators. Before

</p>
<p>The particular jDart of the plan of the traitorous
</p>
<p>conspirators, which had been frustrated by their
</p>
<p>arrest the previous evening, was the following- ;
</p>
<p>and its atrocity fully justified the alarming im-
</p>
<p>pression which the first rumours had created.
</p>
<p>It had been ascertained by the gang, that the
</p>
<p>greater part of his majesty's ministers were to
</p>
<p>dine together at the Earl of Harrowby's, and this
</p>
<p>was considered as a favourable opportunity for
</p>
<p>effecting their entire extermination : Tliistlewood
</p>
<p>was to have knocked at Lord Harrowby's dooi",
</p>
<p>with a letter, purporting to be a despatch, or with
</p>
<p>a red box, such as is used in all the public offices,
</p>
<p>desiring it to be delivered immediately to the
</p>
<p>cabinet ministers at dinner, without delay. Ihe
</p>
<p>servant, it was supposed, would immediately pro-
</p>
<p>ceed with the despatch, while Tliistlewood, w'ith
</p>
<p>another of the conspirators, entered the hall as if
</p>
<p>to wait. They were immediately to open the
</p>
<p>street-door, others were to come in with hand-
</p>
<p>grenades, which were to be thrown into the house;
</p>
<p>and, in the confusion produced by them, all the
</p>
<p>rest of tlie conspirators were to rush into the
</p>
<p>dining-room, where the ministers were at dinner,
</p>
<p>and the work of assassination w as to have ])eeri
</p>
<p>instantly begun.

<p>mind, WTre by no means allayed, wdien, in the
</p>
<p>cuor.rsc of tlie day, the details of the horrible
</p>
<p>iransaclion began to dcvclope tliCmscIves ; every
</p>
<p>one felt a breathless anxiety to probe to the
</p>
<p>boitom tlie r-<ccret w^orkings of so detestable a
</p>
<p>"onspiracy, confide nee between man and man
</p>
<p>l)ecamc weakened, and that social intercourse

<p>ARREST OF TlIi: CONSriRATORS. /
</p>
<p>which constitutes the peculiar charm of society
</p>
<p>ill this happy country, seemed to be placed at
</p>
<p>the mercy of the midnight assassin ; the only
</p>
<p>hope left to the upright and the loyal portion of the
</p>
<p>community was, that the discovery would iinally
</p>
<p>terminate in the beneticial result of purging
</p>
<p>society of some of the* foulest members that ap-
</p>
<p>parently ever moved in it.
</p>
<p>For some time previous to the day on wliicli
</p>
<p>the arrests took place, it had been known to his
</p>
<p>Majesty's government, that an attempt at the
</p>
<p>assassination of his Majesty's ministers was medi-
</p>
<p>tating, and that Arthur Thistlewood was at the
</p>
<p>bottom of it. On Tuesday, the 22d of February,
</p>
<p>certain advice was received, that the attempt was
</p>
<p>to be made on Wednesday night, at the Earl of
</p>
<p>IlarrowdDy's, in Grosvenor-square. It is sup-
</p>
<p>posed that the F^arl of Ilarrowby's was fixed
</p>
<p>upon, because, being nearer the outlet from
</p>
<p>London than the residence of any other of the
</p>
<p>cabinet ministers (Lord Westmoreland's excepted,
</p>
<p>who lives in the atniie square,) escape out of
</p>
<p>town, after the attempt had been made, would
</p>
<p>have been more easy. Be this as it may, the
</p>
<p>conspirators, as soon as they had ascertained
</p>
<p>that the cabinet dinner was to be held there, lost
</p>
<p>no time in arranging their dreadful and diabolical
</p>
<p>project.
</p>
<p>The place chosen to arrange finally their pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings, to collect their force, and to arm them-
</p>
<p>selves, was near the EdgCAvare-road. John-street
</p>
<p>is a short distance on tlie road, and intersected
</p>
<p>by another street, called Cato-street.
</p>
<p>Cato- street is rather an obscure street, and

<p>inhabited by persons in an humble class of life ;
</p>
<p>it runs from John-street into Queen-street, and is
</p>
<p>parallel with Xewnham-street. It is open at one
</p>
<p>end for the admission of carriages, but is closed
</p>
<p>by [losts at the other. The premises occupied

</p>
<p>stable, with a loft above, in a very dilapidated
</p>
<p>condition. They are the property of General
</p>
<p>Watson, and have been recently in the possession
</p>
<p>of an old servant of his, vs^ho had turned cow-
</p>
<p>keeper. From this man they had been engaged
</p>
<p>by some of the diabolical crew whose machina-
</p>
<p>tions have been so happily discovered. The
</p>
<p>people in Cato-street were utterly ignorant that
</p>
<p>the stable was let until Wednesday, when several
</p>
<p>persons were seen to go in and out, and carefully
</p>
<p>to lock the door after them. Some of these
</p>
<p>individuals carried sacks, and parcels of various
</p>
<p>descriptions.
</p>
<p>For two or three hours previous to the entrance
</p>
<p>of the stable, the police-officers were on the spot,
</p>
<p>making their observations, but still no suspicion
</p>
<p>was excited of the real object of their attack ;
</p>
<p>and so well was the plan of surprise laid, that,
</p>
<p>until the discharge of fire-arms was heard, every
</p>
<p>thing remained perfectly quiet.
</p>
<p>Thus accurately informed of the intentions of
</p>
<p>the conspirators, warrants were issued to appre-
</p>
<p>hend them while they were assembled. These
</p>
<p>warrants were put into the hands of the police-
</p>
<p>officers, under the able direction of Richard
</p>
<p>Birnie, Esq., the chief magistrate of Bow-street.
</p>
<p>A detachment of the Coldstream Guards from
</p>
<p>Portman-street barracks, were also ordered to
</p>
<p>accompany the police-officers. They proceeded
</p>
<p>to the place of meeting in Cato-street, the police-
</p>
<p>officers proceeding first. The conspirators had
</p>
<p>taken the precaution to place a sentinel below.
</p>
<p>The military consisted of the picket-guard of
</p>
<p>the 2d Coldstream Regiment, which was stationed

<p>in Portman-street barracks. It consisted of thirty
</p>
<p>men, including a sergeant and corporal, and
</p>
<p>commanded by Captain Frederick Fitzclarcnce,
</p>
<p>who happened to be on duty at the time. They
</p>
<p>were called out about a quarter to eight o'clock ;
</p>
<p>each man provided with twenty rounds of ball
</p>
<p>ARREST OF THE CONSPIRATORS. 9
</p>
<p>cartridge. The detachment immediately pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded in the direction of the Edgware-road.
</p>
<p>The men were not acquainted with the business
</p>
<p>on w^hich they were called out. They supposed
</p>
<p>a fire had taken place, and that they had been
</p>
<p>sent for to protect the property. On their arrival
</p>
<p>within about sixty yards of the house in Cato-
</p>
<p>street, John-street, the place of the meeting,
</p>
<p>they were halted for a few minutes, during which
</p>
<p>they were ordered by Captain Fitzclarence to fix
</p>
<p>bayonets and shoulder arms. They were also
</p>
<p>enjoined to observe the strictest silence. The
</p>
<p>detachment then marched on, but had not pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded more than a few yards when they heard
</p>
<p>the noise of fire-arms. They were then ordered
</p>
<p>to advance in double quick time, and instantly
</p>
<p>came in jimction with the civil officers, w^ho had
</p>
<p>arrived previously on the ground, and were en-
</p>
<p>gaged with the party in the house.
</p>
<p>The only approach to this pandemonium was
</p>
<p>by a narrow ladder. Ruthven, one of the prin-
</p>
<p>cipal Bow- street oincer, led the way, and he
</p>
<p>was followed by Ellis, Smithers, Surman, and
</p>
<p>others of the patrol. On the door being opened,
</p>
<p>about twenty-seven or thirty men were seen
</p>
<p>within, all armed in some way or other; and
</p>
<p>some of them engaged either in charging fire-
</p>
<p>arms, or in girding themselves in belts similar to
</p>
<p>those worn by the military, while others were in
</p>
<p>close and earnest deliberation. There were
</p>
<p>tables about the room, on which lay a number of
</p>
<p>cutlasses, bayonets, pistols, sword-belts, pistol-
</p>
<p>balls in great quantities, ball-cartridges, S'c.
</p>
<p>As the officers entered the room, the conspi-

</p>
<p>rators all started up, when Ruthven, who had
</p>
<p>been furnished with a warrant froux the magis-
</p>
<p>trates, exclaimed  " We are ])eace-officers ! I.ay
</p>
<p>down your arms !" In a moment all was con-
</p>
<p>fusion. The notorious Arthur Thistlewood, op-
</p>
<p>posed himself to the officers, armed willi a cut-
</p>
<p>10 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>and-thrust sword of unusual length. Ruthven
</p>
<p>attempted to secure the door, and Ellis, who had
</p>
<p>followed him into the room, advanced towards
</p>
<p>the man, and, presenting his pistol, exclaimed 
</p>
<p>' Drop your sword, or I'll fire instantly !" This-
</p>
<p>tlewood brandished his sword with increased
</p>
<p>violence, when Smithers, the other patrol, rushed
</p>
<p>forward to seize him; and on the instant the
</p>
<p>ruffian stabbed him to the heart. Poor Smithers
</p>
<p>fell into the arms of his brother-officer, Ellis, ex-
</p>
<p>claiming  "Oh, God! T am " and in the
</p>
<p>next instant was a corpse.
</p>
<p>Whilst this deed was doing, the lights were
</p>
<p>extinguished, and a desperate struggle ensued,
</p>
<p>in which many of the officers were severely
</p>
<p>wounded. Surman, one of the patrol, received
</p>
<p>a musket-ball on the temple, but fortunately it
</p>
<p>only glanced along the side of his head, tearing
</p>
<p>up the scalp in its way. The conspirators kept
</p>
<p>up an incessant fire ; whilst it was evident to the
</p>
<p>officers that many of them were escaping by some
</p>
<p>back way. Mr. Birnie exposed Kim self every
</p>
<p>where, and encouraged the officers to do their duty,
</p>
<p>whilst the balls were whizzing round his head.
</p>
<p>At this moment Captain Fitzclarence (a young-
</p>
<p>officer well known for his gallantry and gentle-
</p>
<p>manly conduct) arrived at the head of the detach-
</p>
<p>ment of the Coldstream Guards. They sur-
</p>
<p>rounded the building, and Captain Fitzclarence,
</p>
<p>with Sergeant Legge and three files of grenadiers
</p>
<p>entered the sta'>ie, where the first object that
</p>
<p>presented itself to their sight, was one of the
</p>
<p>party running out of the stable, apparently with
</p>
<p>intention to make his escape. He was seized by

<p>arm. rortuiiately for this brave man, the ball
</p>
<p>glanced along his arm, tearing the sleeve of his
</p>
<p>jacket, from the wrist to the elbow, and only
</p>
<p>slightly wounding him.
</p>
<p>A black man was the next that was started from
</p>
<p>his place of concealment ; he was armed with a cut-
</p>
<p>lass. He also aimed a blow at captain Fitzclarence,
</p>
<p>but was seized and secured by one of the soldiers,
</p>
<p>James Basey, without any injury to the latter
</p>
<p>but a slight cut on the finger. Then addressing
</p>
<p>himself to his friends in the house, he exclaimed,
</p>
<p>" Fight on while you have a drop of blood in
</p>
<p>you  you may as well die now as at another
</p>
<p>time."
</p>
<p>The detachment was then ordered to rush
</p>
<p>forwaid which they did, headed by their captain,
</p>
<p>who darted into a stall, and seized by the
</p>
<p>collar a fellow who was standing in it, and who
</p>
<p>grappled with him with one hand, while he
</p>
<p>attempted to hre a pistol at him with the other,
</p>
<p>which did not go off, the powder flashing in the
</p>
<p>pan. The miscreant still holding firmly by the
</p>
<p>coat, the captain called out to his men to disen-
</p>
<p>gage him. Two of them, James Revel and James
</p>
<p>Basey, immediately seized him, and he surren-
</p>
<p>dered himself, saying, " Do not kill me, and I'll
</p>
<p>tell you all."' This scene took place in the stable
</p>
<p>on the ground-floor. It was a three-stalled
</p>
<p>stable, with a hay-loft over it, with which it com-
</p>
<p>municated by a ladder placed at one end. The
</p>
<p>detachment led by Captain Fitzclarence then
</p>
<p>mounted the ladder and into the loft, now filled
</p>
<p>with smoke, and only illuminated by the occa-
</p>
<p>sional Hashes of the fire-arms of the conspirators.

</p>
<p>in the confusion naturally occasioned by the
</p>
<p>contest, Thistlcwood contrived to make his es-
</p>
<p>cape, almost unobserved, and the constables had
</p>
<p>by this time retired for the purpose of surrounding
</p>
<p>the house, and intercepting the flight of any
</p>
<p>12 CATO-STUEET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>others of the gang. On entering the loft, the mi-
</p>
<p>litary came in contact with the dead body of the
</p>
<p>murdered Smithers, (the constable), and a ruffian
</p>
<p>lying at his side all covered with the blood of the
</p>
<p>dead man. The fellow rose, and did not appear
</p>
<p>to have sustained any hurt or injury. Addressing
</p>
<p>himself to the soldiers, he said, " I hope they will
</p>
<p>make a difference between the innocent and the
</p>
<p>guilty." Three others were next taken together ;
</p>
<p>they were huddled in a corner among some
</p>
<p>shavings. One of them jumping out said, " I
</p>
<p>resign myself ; there is no harm; I was brought
</p>
<p>in here innocent this afternoon."
</p>
<p>These four were all of them found by the sol-
</p>
<p>diers in the room, making, with the man taken
</p>
<p>below in the stall, and the two outside, seven
</p>
<p>prisoners. The constables had previously taken
</p>
<p>two, one of whom made his escape down the
</p>
<p>street, but was pursued and re-taken. The
</p>
<p>moment he was caught he fired a pistol, which he
</p>
<p>had concealed on his person : it went off, but did
</p>
<p>no injury.
</p>
<p>Muddock, one of the soldiers, when he entered
</p>
<p>the loft, in the midst of darkness, ran against some-
</p>
<p>thing which he at the moment conceived to be a
</p>
<p>part of the building. He was, however, soon un-
</p>
<p>deceived, by a wretch snapping a pistol at him,
</p>
<p>which happily missed fire. Failing in this de-
</p>
<p>testable purpose, the miscreant threw himself on
</p>
<p>the ground, exclaiming, " Use me honourably ,'
</p>
<p>and the gallant soldier contented himself with
</p>
<p>making him prisoner. When this was mentioned
</p>
<p>to Captain Fitzclarence, he asked Muddock why
</p>
<p>he had not stuck his opponent ; the reply of the

</p>
<p>brave fellow was, " Why, your honour, I had
</p>
<p>him by the heels, and I took his pistol from him,
</p>
<p>and I wanted no more." The pistol vvas loaded
</p>
<p>nearly to the muzzle.

<p>desperate conflict which took place, or the nume-
</p>
<p>rous instances of personal daring manifested by the
</p>
<p>j^eace-ofhcers and the military, thus brought into
</p>
<p>sudden contact with a band of assassins in their
</p>
<p>obscure den, and in utter darkness. Unfortunately,
</p>
<p>this darkness favoured the csca})e of many of the
</p>
<p>wretches, and the dreadful skirmish ended in the
</p>
<p>capture of only nine of them. The military, on
</p>
<p>searching the loft, found a great quantity of
</p>
<p>])istols, blunderbusses, swords, and pikes, about
</p>
<p>sixteen inches long, made to screw into a handle.
</p>
<p>They also found a great many common files,
</p>
<p>sharpened to a point at the ends, and made to be
</p>
<p>used as pikes : they also found a large quantity of
</p>
<p>ammunition, consisting of ball-cartridges, powder-
</p>
<p>flasks, slugs wrapt up in paper, and a sack full of
</p>
<p>hand-grenades. The military, accompanied by
</p>
<p>the constables, then withdrew, and proceeded to
</p>
<p>Bow-street-office with their prisoners.
</p>
<p>The soldiers were laden with the arms and
</p>
<p>ammunition which they found in the stable ; and
</p>
<p>having delivered their prisoners and booty, four
</p>
<p>of them were examined briefly by the Magis-
</p>
<p>trates, viz., James Revel, James Basey, William
</p>
<p>Curtis, and John Muddock. They identified the
</p>
<p>prisoners who were then standing at the bar, as
</p>
<p>the persons whom they had taken in the stable.
</p>
<p>The fire-arms and ammunition were then shown
</p>
<p>to them, which they also identified. Captain
</p>
<p>Fitzclarcnce, with his detachment, then marched
</p>
<p>back to Portman-barracks, to which also they
</p>
<p>conveyed the arms and anununition taken, and
</p>
<p>deposited them in the Captain's room.

<p>police-oltice, in Bow-street, Mr. Birnic, the Ma-
</p>
<p>gistrate, arrived, and having taken his seat at the
</p>
<p>bench, the prisoners were placed at the bar in the
</p>
<p>following order: 
</p>
<p>James Ings, a butcher,
</p>
<p>James Wilson, a tailor,

</p>
<p>Richard Bradburn, a carpenter,
</p>
<p>James Gilchrist, a shoemaker,
</p>
<p>Charles Cooper, a bootmaker,
</p>
<p>Richard Tidd, a bootmaker,
</p>
<p>John Monument, a shoemaker,
</p>
<p>John Shaw, a carpenter, and
</p>
<p>William Davidson, a cabinet-maker.
</p>
<p>Davidson is a man of colour, and a worthy co-
</p>
<p>adjutor of Messrs. Watson, Thistlewood, and Co.,
</p>
<p>upon many occasions. At the meeting in Fins-
</p>
<p>bury market-place, a few months ago, this fel-
</p>
<p>low was one of the principal speakers, and ad-
</p>
<p>vised the persons assembled to go armed to all
</p>
<p>public meetings ; and was also the bearer of the
</p>
<p>black flag, with a death's head, in the mob which
</p>
<p>attempted to excite a tumult in Covent-garden,
</p>
<p>during the election. When Ellis, the officer, was
</p>
<p>putting the handcuffs on him, he amused himself
</p>
<p>by vociferating passages from the popular air of
</p>
<p>" Scots wha ha'e wi' Wallace bled," and fre-
</p>
<p>quently exclaiming, '* B  st and d  n the eyes
</p>
<p>of all those who would not die for liberty."'
</p>
<p>Ings is a fierce ruffian, a short stout man, ap-
</p>
<p>parently between 30 and 40, but of most deter-
</p>
<p>mined aspect. His hands were covered with
</p>
<p>blood ; and as he stood at the bar, manacled to
</p>
<p>one of his wretched confederates, his large fiery
</p>
<p>eyes glared round upon the spectators with an
</p>
<p>expression truly horrible. The rest had nothing
</p>
<p>extraordinary in their appearance. They were
</p>
<p>for the most part men of short stature, mean ex-
</p>
<p>terior, and unmarked physiognomy.
</p>
<p>The office was crowded with soldiers and
</p>
<p>officers, bringing in arms and ammunition of

<p>various kinds, which had been taken on the

<p>premises; muskets, carabines, broad-swords, pis-
</p>
<p>tols, blunderbusses, belts, and cartouch- boxes,
</p>
<p>ball cartridges, gunpowder, (found loose in the
</p>
<p>pockets of the prisoners), haversacks, and a
</p>
<p>large bundk of singularly-constructed stilettoes.

</p>
<p>These latter were about 18 inches long, and tri-
</p>
<p>angular in form : two of the sides being concave,
</p>
<p>and the other flat; the lower extremity having
</p>
<p>been flattened, and then wrung round spirally,
</p>
<p>so as to make a firm grip, and ending in a screw,
</p>
<p>as if to fit into the top of a staff". Several stavet
</p>
<p>indeed were produced, fitted at one end with a
</p>
<p>screwed socket; and no doubt they were in-
</p>
<p>tended to receive this formidable weapon.

<p>The depositions of a number of otiicers, most
</p>
<p>of them wounded, and several of the soldiers,
</p>
<p>having been taken, their evidence substantiating
</p>
<p>the foregoing narrative, the prisoners were asked
</p>
<p>whether they wished to say any thing? Cooper,
</p>
<p>and Davidson the black, were the only ones who
</p>
<p>replied, and they merely appealed to the officers
</p>
<p>and soldiers to say, whether they had not in-
</p>
<p>stantly surrendered themselves. Ellis, the patrol,
</p>
<p>who received the murdered body of his comrade
</p>
<p>Smithers in his arms, replied, that Davidson had
</p>
<p>made the most resistance. At the moment when
</p>
<p>the lights were extinguished, he had rushed out of
</p>
<p>the place, armed with a carbine, and wearing-
</p>
<p>white cross-belts. Ellis pursued him a consi-
</p>
<p>derable distance along John-street; and, having
</p>
<p>caught him, they fell together, and in the deadly
</p>
<p>struggle which ensued, Davidson discharged his
</p>
<p>car])me, but without etfect, and Ellis succeeded
</p>
<p>in securing him.
</p>
<p>Captain Fitzclarencc had seized and secured
</p>
<p>one or two of the prisoners with his own hands,
</p>
<p>and he was not only much bruised, but his uni-
</p>
<p>form was almost torn to pieces.

</p>
<p>conscious of the blessings of that constitution,
</p>
<p>which in the equal and upright administration of
</p>
<p>justice to all, gives to the accused party the ad-
</p>
<p>vantage of the conscientious doubts of the jury,
</p>
<p>and which beneficent feature in the trial by a
</p>
<p>British Jury had alone saved him from condign
</p>
<p>punishment, had never ceased to pursue his dis-
</p>
<p>loyal and traitorous designs, but had still continued
</p>
<p>in darkness and obscurity, to hatch new plots, as
</p>
<p>preposterous as diabolical, and to entrap new
</p>
<p>agents, as weak as they were wicked, and as
</p>
<p>certain of being ultimately involved in the same
</p>
<p>sacrifice to public justice, as he himself seemed
</p>
<p>devoted to by a besotted perseverance in his hor-
</p>
<p>rid principles.
</p>
<p>Conscious, however, as were the ministers that
</p>
<p>some dreadful scheme was perfecting, and that a
</p>
<p>tremendous blow was about to be struck, they
</p>
<p>were ignorant of the time or nature of the intended
</p>
<p>movement, until the very day destined for its
</p>
<p>consummation, when a communication was made
</p>
<p>to the Secretary of State for the Home Depart-

<p>ment, by Lord Harrowby, who stated that he
</p>
<p>had that morning been stopped by a man, when
</p>
<p>riding in St James's-pavk, who delivered to him
</p>
<p>a letter, the contents of which were, that a gang
</p>
<p>of assassins were to assassinate his Lordship and

<p>the rest of the cabinet ministers, when assembled
</p>
<p>at his house on the evening of that day at a ca-

<p>and their intended diabolical act is next to a mi-
</p>
<p>racle, and is only to be attributed to the deter-
</p>
<p>mination and perseverance of the man who made
</p>
<p>the communication to the earl of Harrowby : he
</p>
<p>called at his lordship's house, in Grosvenor-
</p>
<p>square, on Wednesday morning, (the 23d), be-
</p>
<p>tween eleven and twelve o'clock, and inquired of
</p>
<p>the porter if the noble earl was at home ? The
</p>
<p>porter replied in the negative. The man ap-
</p>
<p>peared very anxious to see his lordship, but the
</p>
<p>porter did not give him any hopes, as he refused
</p>
<p>to tell his business ; the man, however, urged the
</p>
<p>necessity of seeing his lordship, without loss of
</p>
<p>time ; and at length he observed, that if he did
</p>
<p>not see him, the porter would not be sitting in
</p>
<p>his chair in the hall to-morrow. This observation
</p>
<p>astonished the porter, and induced him to believe
</p>
<p>that the man really had something of a serious
</p>
<p>and alarming nature to communicate to the noble
</p>
<p>earl : he then told him that his lordship was riding
</p>
<p>on horseback in the park, directed him to that
</p>
<p>part in which he was most likely to find him, and
</p>
<p>described his groom and the livery he wore, ^-c.
</p>
<p>The man hastened to the Park, and discovered
</p>
<p>the groom, as described by the porter, hailed him,
</p>
<p>and asked him if the gentleman before was the
</p>
<p>carl of Harrowby ? The groom replied in the
</p>
<p>affirmative. The man then told him, that he
</p>
<p>wanted and must speak with his lordship. The
</p>
<p>j^rooin informed his noble master, who immedi-
</p>
<p>ately stop])ed his horse. The man then pre-
</p>
<p>sented a letter to him, which the earl opened and
</p>
<p>read. The man having informed him that he had
</p>
<p>a deal more to communicate, his lordship dis-

<p>mounted, and walked and talked with the man
</p>

</p>
<p>prehension of the villains. The first intimation
</p>
<p>that was given of the affair at the office in Bow-
</p>
<p>street was at past seven o'clock, when it was made
</p>
<p>known that a number of officers, constables, and
</p>
<p>patrol, would be wanted. Ellis, who is a con-
</p>
<p>ductor of a party of patrol, was ordered to leave
</p>
<p>his division, and repair to the office with the men
</p>
<p>under his direction. The expedition upon which
</p>
<p>they were to be sent was kept a secret till they
</p>
<p>started, which was between half-past eight o'clock
</p>
<p>and nine. The place of rendezvous of the assas-
</p>
<p>sins was in Cato-street, John-street, in the Edg-
</p>
<p>ware-road, where the neighbours had become
</p>
<p>alarmed by a number of strange men assembling
</p>
<p>in a stable, and a loft over it, after dark ; sacks
</p>
<p>being hung up on the inside of the windows to
</p>
<p>prevent detection.
</p>
<p>In the course of the day inquiries had been
</p>
<p>made, and the result was, that some desperate
</p>
<p>act was expected to take place. The ministers'
</p>
<p>servants were armed with pistols, and two officers
</p>
<p>or constables appointed to each residence. The
</p>
<p>Earl of Harrowby and Viscount Castlereagh dined
</p>
<p>with the Earl of Liverpool ; and at nine o'clock
</p>
<p>they went to the secretary of state's office for the
</p>
<p>home department, at which time all the cabinet
</p>
<p>ministers asserabl-ed. Mr. Birnie, the magistrate,
</p>
<p>was directed by Viscount Sidmouth to be in Cato-
</p>
<p>street, and in readiness to act in case of emer-
</p>
<p>gency. A party of the guards, under the com-
</p>
<p>mand of Captain Fitzclarence, was ordered to
</p>
<p>march to Cato-street, to assist the police, if
</p>
<p>necessary. Unfortunately, however, they were
</p>
<p>not clearly directed, or they did not understand

<p>where the place was, as they were at the con-
</p>
<p>trary end of the street when the assassins com-
</p>
<p>menced their murderous attack upon the officers,
</p>
<p>and it was only by the discharge of pistols that
</p>
<p>they found out where the building was. When
</p>
<p>the [>olice-oHicers arrived, tlicy found two fr^cn-
</p>
<p>AIlHESr OF THE COXSP I R ATORfi. 19
</p>
<p>tinels at the door, armed with c^uns and swords.
</p>
<p>These opposed their admittance without the
</p>
<p>pass-word. The officers, however, soon over-
</p>
<p>powered and secured them. They then gave an
</p>
<p>alarm, and the ofricers heard by the noise in the
</p>
<p>loft that several persons were up stairs. They as-
</p>
<p>cended to the loft by a ladder which the con-
</p>
<p>spirators themselves had used ; when the contest,
</p>
<p>which we have already described, ending in the
</p>
<p>arrest of most of the conspirators, took place.
</p>
<p>The same sources of information which led to
</p>
<p>the detection of the conspiracy enabled the ma-
</p>
<p>gistiites to trace the hiding-place of Thistlewood.
</p>
<p>Instead of returning to his own lodgings in Stan-
</p>
<p>hope-street, Clare-market, it was discovered that
</p>
<p>he had proceeded to an obscure house, No. S,
</p>
<p>White-street, Little Moorfields, Thither, at nine
</p>
<p>o'clock on Thursday morning, the 24th of Fe-
</p>
<p>bruary, Lavender, Bishop, lluthven, Salmon, and
</p>
<p>six of the patrol, were despatched. On arriving
</p>
<p>at the house, three of the latter were placed at
</p>
<p>the front, and three at the back door, to prevent
</p>
<p>escape. Bishop observed a room on the ground-
</p>
<p>floor, the door of which he tried to open, but
</p>
<p>found it locked. He called to a woman in the
</p>
<p>opposite apartment, whose name is Karris, to
</p>
<p>fetch him the key. She hesitated, but at last
</p>
<p>brought it. He then opened the door softly.
</p>
<p>The light was partially excluded, from the shut-
</p>
<p>ters being shut ; but he perceived a bed in the
</p>
<p>corner, and advanced. At that instant a head
</p>
<p>was gently raised from under the blankets, and
</p>
<p>the countenance of Thistlewood was presented
</p>
<p>to his view. Bishop drew a pistol, and pre-

</p>
<p>senting it at him, exclaimed, " Mr. Thistlewood,
</p>
<p>I am a Bow-street officer ; you are my prisoner :"
</p>
<p>and then, " to make assurance doubly sure," he
</p>
<p>threw himself upon him. Thistlewood said, he
</p>
<p>would make no resistance. Lavender, lluthven.

</p>
<p>and Salmon, were then called, and the prisoner
</p>
<p>was permitted to rise. He had his breeches and
</p>
<p>stockings on, and seemed much agitated. On
</p>
<p>being dressed, he was handcuffed ; in his pockets
</p>
<p>were found some ball-cartridges and flints, the
</p>
<p>black girdle, or belt, which he was seen to wear
</p>
<p>in Cato-street, and a sort of military silk sash.
</p>
<p>A hackney-coach was then sent for, and he
</p>
<p>was conveyed to Bow-street. In his way thither
</p>
<p>he was asked by Bishop, what he meant to do
</p>
<p>with the ball- cartridges; he declined answering
</p>
<p>any questions. He was followed by a crowd of
</p>
<p>persons, who repeatedly cried out, *' Hang the
</p>
<p>villain ! hang the assassin !" and used other ex-
</p>
<p>clamations of a similar nature.
</p>
<p>When he arrived at Bow-street, he was first
</p>
<p>taken into the public office, but subsequently
</p>
<p>into a private room, where he was heard, un-
</p>
<p>guardedly, to say, that " he knew he had killed
</p>
<p>one man, and he only hoped it was Stafford;
</p>
<p>meaning Mr. Stafford, the chief clerk of the
</p>
<p>office, to whose unremitting exertions in the de-
</p>
<p>tection of public delinquents too much praise
</p>
<p>cannot be given.
</p>
<p>Mr. Birnie, having taken a short examination
</p>
<p>of the prisoner, sent him to Whitehall to be ex-
</p>
<p>amined by the Privy-Council. Here the crowd
</p>
<p>was as great as that which had been collected in
</p>
<p>Bow-street. Persons of the highest rank came
</p>
<p>pouring into the Home Office, to learn the parti-
</p>
<p>culars of what had transpired.
</p>
<p>The arrest of Thistlewood was heard with infi-
</p>
<p>nite satisfaction ; he was placed in a room on the
</p>
<p>ground-floor, and a vast number of persons were

</p>
<p>admitted in their turn to see him. His appear-
</p>
<p>ance was most forbidding. His countenance, at
</p>
<p>all times unfavourable, seemed now to have ac-
</p>
<p>quired an additional degree of malignity. His
</p>
<p>dark eye turned upon the spectators as they came
</p>
<p>in, a^ if he expected to see some of his compa-

</p>
<p>nions in g'uilt, who he had licard were to be
</p>
<p>brought thither. He drank some porter that was
</p>
<p>handed to him, and occasionally asked questions,
</p>
<p>principally as to the names ol" the persons who
</p>
<p>came to look at him. Then he asked " to what
</p>
<p>gaol he should be sent ?  he hoped not to Hor-
</p>
<p>yham/* (This was the place in which he was
</p>
<p>confined, in consequence of his conviction for
</p>
<p>sending a challenge to Lord Sidmouth.)
</p>
<p>At two o'clock he was conducted before the
</p>
<p>Privy-Council. He was still handcuffed, but
</p>
<p>mounted the stairs with alacrity. On entering
</p>
<p>the council- chamber he was placed at the foot of
</p>
<p>the table. He was then addressed by the Lord
</p>
<p>Chancellor, who informed him that he stood
</p>
<p>charged with the twofold crime of treason and
</p>
<p>murder; and asked him whether he had anything to
</p>
<p>say for himself? He answered, that " he should
</p>
<p>decline saying any thing on that occasion.'
</p>
<p>No persons were suffered to have access ex-
</p>
<p>cept those on business to the public offices at
</p>
<p>Whitehall, nor was any individual allowed to hold
</p>
<p>communication with the prisoner. About a
</p>
<p>dozen soldiers were in the hall and adjoining
</p>
<p>lodge ; they formed a part of the military escort
</p>
<p>that accompanied the police-officers to the spot
</p>
<p>where Thistlewood and his companions were
</p>
<p>first discovered. The soldiers had Avith them
</p>
<p>the different articles and weapons found n})on
</p>
<p>the party when taken, among which were two
</p>
<p>small pistols, one of them loaded, and a bundle
</p>
<p>of files, similar to those used in small brass-
</p>
<p>work. The points of su^li files are always sharp,
</p>
<p>and the part of the file which goes into the

<p>liandle is necessarily pointed, to ])enetrate the
</p>
<p>hole made in the wood for its reception ; some of
</p>
<p>the files appeared, however, to have had the
</p>
<p>handle-points brightened, and the ends made
</p>
<p>more fine, as if by being whetted upon a stone.
</p>
<p>There were also in the hall two or three bags,
</p>
<p>1D
</p>
<p>22 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>containing tln-ce bayonets and some ammunition,
</p>
<p>made up in both small and large cartridges. The
</p>
<p>soldiers who had seized those articles were exa-
</p>
<p>mined before the Privy-Council. Alter his exa-
</p>
<p>mination, Thistlewood was taken back to the
</p>
<p>room in which he had been previously placed ;
</p>
<p>his commitment to Coldbath-fields was made out,
</p>
<p>and he w^as conveyed to that ]:)rison under the
</p>
<p>care of six officers. There was a partial shouting
</p>
<p>and groaning, as the carriage in which he was
</p>
<p>placed drove oli".
</p>
<p>The apjiearancc of Thistlewood at this time
</p>
<p>was wretched in the extreme. When in custody
</p>
<p>with Watson, Preston, and Hooper, on the charge
</p>
<p>for high treason, he w^as a stout, active, cheerful-
</p>
<p>looking man, with something of a fearless and
</p>
<p>determined cast of features. His deportment at
</p>
<p>that time was iree and unembarassed, with nnich
</p>
<p>of the air of a sea-faring man. Within the six
</p>
<p>months previous to the present arrest, his ap-
</p>
<p>pearance had, in every respect, undergone a total
</p>
<p>change ; he had been seen constantly in the streets,
</p>
<p>dressed in a shabby manner; his countenance
</p>
<p>sc^ualid and emaciated, and his whole dress and
</p>
<p>the expression of hi.s features, denoting a man who
</p>
<p>was reduced to a state of extreme indigence.
</p>
<p>He was generally observed walking or running
</p>

<p>as they pussed through the hall on their \vay to

</p>
<p>The following- Privy-Councillors were ]n'esent

<p>at his examination:  The Duke ol" AVellin,ot(jn,

<p>the ]virls ot" Ilarrowby, Liverj^ool, and \\ est-

</p>
<p>neral, (Sir S, Shepherd), Mr. Bragge Bathurst,
</p>
<p>and other members of the cabinet.
</p>
<p>It is im})ossible to describe the anxiety and
</p>
<p>horror which prevaded the countenances of thou-
</p>
<p>sands of persons who went to view the scene of
</p>
<p>action the day after the arrest. Through the
</p>
<p>whole of the day, and till very h\te in the even-
</p>
<p>ing, several persons of the highest consideration
</p>
<p>in the country visited the place. A man no
</p>
<p>way authorized, took possession of the place, and
</p>
<p>imposed on the public by demanding a shilling
</p>
<p>from each person for admission.
</p>
<p>The alarm in the neighbourhood, on hearing
</p>
<p>the report of fire-anns, and the noise of contest
</p>
<p>on premises which they considered untenanted,
</p>
<p>may be more easily conceived than described. It
</p>
<p>was heightened by every circumstance of terror
</p>
<p>that the imagination could form to itself. The

<p>after running to the s])ot, fied in dismay when
</p>
<p>they heard the balls wdiislling aliout their ears.
</p>
<p>Several of the inhabitants of Cato-street had
</p>
<p>observed, since the preceding Mijnday, slrange-
</p>
<p>looking men coming about the empty premises.
</p>
<p>On the morning of Wednesday, (the day of the
</p>
<p>24 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.

<p>arrest) they saw Davidson, the man of colour,
</p>
<p>and three others, watching at different ends of
</p>
<p>the street, while some of their associates were
</p>
<p>heard nailing up the windows within the loft.
</p>
<p>Before dusk Davidson again made his appear-
</p>
<p>ance, with a sack on his back, which the neigh-
</p>
<p>bours at the time supposed to contain carpenters'
</p>
<p>tools for repairing or new-modelling the interior
</p>
<p>of the building, but which had in fact conveyed
</p>
<p>the arms with v/hich they were to equip them-
</p>
<p>selves for their daring enterprise. After the
</p>
<p>arsenal was formed, the band arrived ; and the
</p>
<p>people in the public-house were surprised, if not
</p>
<p>alarmed, to see upwards of twenty persons, en-
</p>
<p>tire strangers to the place, hovering about their
</p>
<p>premises, and at last entering the den. Still they
</p>
<p>had no suspicion of what was going forward, and
</p>
<p>no presentiment of what was in a short time to occur.
</p>
<p>The police soon arrived, and the murderous strug-
</p>
<p>gle took place which we have already described.
</p>
<p>The body of Smithers, who was murdered,
</p>
<p>was removed to the Horse and Groom public-
</p>
<p>house, opposite. He must have died instantly,
</p>
<p>and without convulsion. He received only one
</p>
<p>wound, about an inch below his right breast,
</p>
<p>and about an inch in width. His body was
</p>
<p>exposed in a room on the first floor of the
</p>
<p>public-house, above-mentioned, in the dress in
</p>
<p>which he was killed. His breast and neck were
</p>
<p>covered with blood, but his countenance was as
</p>
<p>placid, and his features as composed, as if their
</p>
<p>expression had been arrested, and life extin-
</p>
<p>guished, during a tranquil sleep. On his death

</p>
<p>pathy for his surviving widow ; saying, with great
</p>
<p>humanity, that, as he could not, restore to her

</p>
<p>was one of the first to view the dead body of her
</p>
<p>brother, and deeply affected the spectators with
</p>
<p>the poignancy of lier sorrow.
</p>
<p>The sword with which the murder of Smithers
</p>
<p>was perpetrated is of foreign manufacture, and
</p>
<p>nearly a foot longer than those which we are ordi-
</p>
<p>narily in the habit of seeing.
</p>
<p>A lady, of the name of Ts orthmore, who lives in
</p>
<p>a street immediately adjoining that in which the
</p>
<p>conspirators assembled, found a sabre in her yard,
</p>
<p>which had been thrown away by one of the gang,
</p>
<p>in his flight. This also is a weapon of foreign ma-
</p>
<p>nufacture, and, from its appearance, had evidently
</p>
<p>been ground within a day or two. It was per-
</p>
<p>fectly sharp on both sides, and, in addition to its
</p>
<p>brass hilt, there was attached to it a handkerchief,
</p>
<p>so disposed as to afford a sort of guard for the
</p>
<p>arm. Mrs. jVorthmore, on finding the weapon,
</p>
<p>sent for a friend, who advised her to transmit it to
</p>
<p>Bow-street. This was accordingly done ; and,
</p>
<p>extraordinary to relate, it was recognised by an
</p>
<p>active member of that establishment as exactly
</p>
<p>representing one of two sabres, of which a de-
</p>
<p>scription had been given at the office, and which
</p>
<p>were known to have been lately taken to a cutler,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of grinding.
</p>
<p>The hand-grenades found in the loft, and pro-
</p>
<p>duced in the examination, are about the size of a
</p>
<p>large orange, made of cast-iron, filled with com-
</p>
<p>bustibles ; they have a round hole, in which is
</p>
<p>placed a fuse, which, on being set fire to, is
</p>
<p>thrown by the hand, and when it falls it explodes :

<p>the splinters caused by the explosion spread in

<p>all directions, and one of them has been known to

<p>After the connnittal of Thistlewood by the Privy-

<p>their being re-committed, one of them proposed to
</p>
<p>become king's evidence, which offer was accepted.
</p>
<p>During the attendance of Mr. Birnie upon
</p>
<p>the Privy-Council on Thistlewood's examination,
</p>
<p>the officers arrived at Bow-street, with all the
</p>
<p>persons found in the house where Thistiewood
</p>
<p>had been apprehended, and Mr. J. E, Coxaxt,
</p>
<p>the magistrate, proceeded with their examination ;
</p>
<p>they consisted of the landlady of the house,
</p>
<p>Mrs, Hill, a lodger, and Lewis Casper, a man
</p>
<p>who did not lodge in it.
</p>
<p>Elizabeth Harris, the landlady, stated, that her
</p>
<p>husband worked at the letter-foundry of Messrs.
</p>
<p>Caslon and Catherwood, in Chi swell-street, Moor-
</p>
<p>lields. On Wednesday, the 23d of February, she
</p>
<p>had a bill in her window to let her lodgings,
</p>
<p>when in the morning, between ten and eleven
</p>
<p>o'clock, Thistiewood came into her house, and
</p>
<p>inquired about the lodging : she told him it was
</p>
<p>only half a bed with her nephew. Thistiewood
</p>
<p>agreed for the half bed, for which he was to pay two
</p>
<p>shillings and sixpence a week, and was to take
</p>
<p>possession of it that night. She at first said, that
</p>
<p>she had a slight knowledge of Thistiewood, but
</p>
<p>denied it afterwards. It was supposed she was
</p>
<p>concealing him, as he was locked up in the room.
</p>
<p>This she explained, by saying the door flew open,
</p>
<p>and she could not keep it shut without locking it.
</p>
<p>She said Thistiewood arrived at her house be-
</p>
<p>tween ten and eleven o'clock on Wednesday
</p>
<p>night: he observed that he was late; she replied
</p>
<p>he was late, and she had almost given him up.

<p>He then went to bed. Her street-door standing

<p>Lewis Casper stated himself to be a watch-
</p>
<p>finisher, residing- in Union-street, Bishopsgatc,
</p>
<p>and accounted for his being- in the house by say-
</p>
<p>ing he was with I\Irs. Hill, the lodger, who
</p>
<p>washed for him, and he appointed his little boy
</p>
<p>to call for a key there.
</p>
<p>This man was detained till it was ascertained
</p>
<p>if he was tlie man he represented himself to be.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Harris and iMrs. Hill were discharged for
</p>
<p>the present.
</p>
<p>In the course of Thursday, the 24th of Fe-
</p>
<p>bruary, the following persons were arrested as
</p>
<p>concerned in the conspiracy: 
</p>
<p>Bruxt, who was to have been second in com-
</p>
<p>mand to Thistlewood. He was a shoemaker ; an
</p>
<p>excellent workman, and earned between forty and
</p>
<p>fifty shillings a week. He was taken in bed.
</p>
<p>He had previously provided himself with a sword
</p>
<p>and a brace of pistols, in case of need, but he did
</p>
<p>not make use of them on this occasion. He was
</p>
<p>apprehended at his lodgings in Fox-court, GiTiy's-
</p>
<p>inn-lane; in his room a vast ciuantity of hand-
</p>
<p>grenades, and other combustibles, were found.
</p>
<p>''J'hese were charged with powder, pieces of old
</p>
<p>iron, and other materials, calculated upon ex-
</p>
<p>plosion to produce" the most horrible conse-
</p>
<p>quences. A great number of pike-blades, or
</p>
<p>stilettoes, such as were discovered in Cato-street,
</p>
<p>and a number of lire-arms, were likewise found.
</p>
<p>The whole of these were taken to Bow-street,
</p>
<p>He was afterwards sent to Whitehall, ;ind llien
</p>
<p>committed to Coldbath-fields.

<p>family in Seymour-street. He underwent an ex-
</p>
<p>amination before the secretary of state for the
</p>
<p>home department, and another before the ma-
</p>
<p>gistrates at Bow-street, was ultimately committed
</p>
<p>to Tothill-fields' prison.
</p>
<p>Tadd, a shoemaker, of whom the following ac-
</p>
<p>count was given at the period of his arrest. He
</p>
<p>is a man of the age of 49, and lived with his wife
</p>
<p>and familjr in a small and miserable dwelling
</p>
<p>situated in the Hole-in-the- Wall-passage, leading
</p>
<p>from Baldwin's-gardens to Torrington-street. His
</p>
<p>family consists of one daughter, and two orphan
</p>
<p>children, whom he had taken under his care.
</p>
<p>Tadd has been esteemed among his neighbours, and
</p>
<p>by those who have employed him in his trade, as an
</p>
<p>industrious sober man, and an excellent workman.
</p>
<p>He has earned by his own hands forty shillings
</p>
<p>a week, and very often even a greater sum.
</p>
<p>During the whole course of his life, he was never
</p>
<p>known to neglect his work, or become inebriated ;
</p>
<p>but within the last week he had been in a drunken
</p>
<p>state, and his family had been at a loss to ac-
</p>
<p>count for the extraordinary change in his conduct.
</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, three men came to Tadd
</p>
<p>while in such a state of drunkenness as scarcely
</p>
<p>to be able to keep his legs, and forced him away,
</p>
<p>notwithstanding the earnest entreaties and remon-
</p>
<p>stances of" his wife and family. Nothing was
</p>
<p>said by the men who took him away, as to their
</p>
<p>object, either to the wife or any one in the house ;
</p>
<p>and during the whole night, and the greater part
</p>
<p>of the next day, they were in total ignorance of
</p>
<p>the circumstances since disclosed, and were at a
</p>
<p>loss to account for the absence of Tadd. In the

<p>morning (Thursday), between seven and eight
</p>
<p>o'clock, two men came to the house, laden with a
</p>
<p>box of a considerable size, and, putting it down
</p>
<p>on the Hoor, said, " they would call in a few
</p>
<p>minutes for it." The men refused to answer the
</p>
<p>interrogatories put to them as to their object in

</p>
<p>leaving- the box, and only repeated, that they
</p>
<p>would call ill a short time, and take it away:
</p>
<p>V^ery soon afterwards, two more men came with
</p>
<p>a large bundle of sticks, some of them of the
</p>
<p>thickness of a man's wrist. These were left in a
</p>
<p>similar manner, and the men also refused to an-
</p>
<p>swer any questions, saying only, that they would
</p>
<p>call again for them in a few minutes. Ten minutes
</p>
<p>had not elapsed before two police-otiicers en-
</p>
<p>tered the house, and seized the box and sticks.
</p>
<p>When opened, the box was discovered to con-
</p>
<p>tain a great number of pike-heads, sharpened
</p>
<p>ready for use. The sticks were also seized,
</p>
<p>and carried away by the officers. It would ap-
</p>
<p>])ear, from this statement, that Tadd was taken
</p>
<p>by the three men whom we have described to the
</p>
<p>stable in Cato-street, where he was subsecjuently
</p>
<p>apprehended, and carried to Bow-street, together
</p>
<p>with several others.
</p>
<p>Robert Adams, living in a miserable hovel in
</p>
<p>Brooks'-markct, llolborn, and working as a shoe-
</p>
<p>maker. He some time since was a private in

<p>the Royal Horse-guards, in which regiment he
</p>
<p>served for five years. He very much resembles

<p>Tliistlev/ood in his person, but has a cast m his

<p>In addition to these arrests, several warrants

<p>were issued, among which was one against a

<p>The lodgings of Thislle\v(j()d, and of all the others

<p>temptation of joining his former associates.
</p>
<p>It is a singular fact, that when Thistlewood
</p>
<p>was arrested, he had not a farthing of money in
</p>
<p>his possession. The same observation may be
</p>
<p>made with respect to his comrades, all of whom
</p>
<p>were in the most wretched state of poverty.
</p>
<p>We will here suspend for a time the particulars
</p>
<p>of the proceedings against the Conspirators, for

<p>the purpose of recording the proceedings of the
</p>
<p>Coroner's Inquest on the body of Richard
</p>
<p>Smithers, the unfortunate Bow-street officer,
</p>
<p>who was murdered, as before stated, when in the

</p>
<p>inquest was held on Friday the 25th February, at
</p>
<p>the Horse and Groom public-house, John-street,
</p>
<p>Edgeware-road. which is situated but a few
</p>
<p>yards from the spot where the atrocious deed

<p>was perpetrated. In the course of the day great

<p>numbers of persons visited the miserable building
</p>
<p>which the Conspirators had selected as the scene
</p>
<p>of their deliberations, and one universal feeling
</p>
<p>of horror and detestation against Thistlewood
</p>
<p>and his infamous associates appeared to actuate
</p>
<p>the multitude.

<p>The Coroner for the county of Middlesex,

<p>for the first time, this day, to examine the body

<p>of the deceased. I found an external wound

<p>under the right breast. It was two inches in

<p>the chest, lacerated the pericardium, penetrated
</p>
<p>the right ventricle of the heart, wounded the left
</p>
<p>lobe of the lungs, and struck against the ribs
</p>
<p>on the left side. The wound I supposed to be
</p>
<p>about twelve inches in length. The blood flowed
</p>
<p>from the heart, and occasioned immediate death.
</p>
<p>The opening in the pericardium was larger than
</p>
<p>that ])resented by the external wound, which
</p>
<p>was always the case with wounds of this descrip-
</p>
<p>tion. The weapon was prevented from passing
</p>
<p>entirely through the body by the ribs on the left
</p>
<p>side. It must have been a very sharp instru-
</p>
<p>ment, both pointed and cutting, to make such a
</p>
<p>wound. The membranes, which w^ere cut asun-
</p>
<p>der, could only have been severed by an exceed-
</p>
<p>ingly sharp instrument. That death was inevita-
</p>
<p>ble after such a wound, the heart having been
</p>
<p>cut open, and the blood efiused into the cavity
</p>
<p>of the chest.

</p>
<p>an order from .Mr. Birnie, who is a .fustice of the

</p>
<p>shed or stable in Cato-street, in consequence of a

</p>
<p>Mr. Baker, a magistrate of Marlborough-street. On
</p>
<p>entering the house, I observed in the lower place
</p>
<p>a man with a cntlass at his side, and a musket
</p>
<p>on his shoulder. The door by wdiich I entered
</p>
<p>from the street was not fast ; there were persons
</p>
<p>going in and out; the man with the musket
</p>
<p>seemed as if he was guarding the staircases-
</p>
<p>there was only one man on guard. Ellis, Smithers,
</p>
<p>the deceased, and several others, w^ent in with me.
</p>
<p>I don't know how they came in. They were of
</p>
<p>course ordered. They were all constables, in
</p>
<p>number about a dozen. 1 was the first person
</p>
<p>that entered. Mr. Birnie, the magistrate, w^as
</p>
<p>not there at that time ; he w^as at hand in the
</p>
<p>street, giving orders. The man who stood at the
</p>
<p>door as sentinel was walking about. I did not
</p>
<p>stop to see what he did particularly, but imme-
</p>
<p>diately called out to some of the party who dA-
</p>
<p>lowed to secure him. I am not aware that they did
</p>
<p>secure him, for I immediately w^ent up the stairs.
</p>
<p>I believe that man w^as taken ; but I am not aware
</p>
<p>that he was apprehended then ; I believe he was
</p>
<p>caught afterwards. I ascended by a sort of step-
</p>
<p>ladder staircase. The stairs were so narrow,
</p>
<p>that the officers were obliged to \^o one by one.
</p>
<p>When I got up to the top of the ladder, I o]>-
</p>
<p>served a sort of table or carpenter's bench, and a
</p>
<p>number of arms on it. Thistlewood vvas on the
</p>
<p>right-hand side of the table. I know^ Thistle-
</p>

</p>
<p>and nights together, i think about twenty-four
</p>
<p>or twenty-five persons were asscinbled. There
</p>
<p>were different sorts of arms en the table : a

<p>variety of pistols and swords. Tlicy looked as

<p>I am quite certain that he was present : I have

</p>
<p>a sort of a lon^- brown coat, I think. I knew
</p>
<p>him as well as I knew my father ; quite as well.
</p>
<p>I could not be mistaken. I iiave no doubt what-
</p>
<p>ever as to the identity of Thistlewood. As soon
</p>
<p>as I thought that three or four of the party were
</p>
<p>up, I said aloud, " We are officers, seize their
</p>
<p>arms." I did this to warn the people who we
</p>
<p>were. As soon as I said this, they each took up
</p>
<p>what they could from the table, and retired to the
</p>
<p>farther part of the room. Thistlewood, being near
</p>
<p>a door that leads into a little closet over the
</p>
<p>coach-house, retired into that room. He was not
</p>
<p>further from the door of the little room than I am
</p>
<p>from that gentleman who is writing there (pointing
</p>
<p>to a gentleman who sat writing within about four
</p>
<p>feet of witness). There were others in that little
</p>
<p>room ; how they got in there I cannot tell. I
</p>
<p>suppose there were five or six, or four or five
</p>
<p>persons in it. The whole party appeared at that
</p>
<p>time to be armed. Thistlewood, as he retired, had
</p>
<p>a sword in his hand, which he moved in a me-
</p>
<p>nacing way to keep the officers off. He was not
</p>
<p>striking with it, but moving his arm round as if
</p>
<p>to make a stab. The sword appeared bright.
</p>
<p>As we approached, he retired ; and Smithers, who
</p>
<p>was within a pace of me to the right, stepped for-
</p>
<p>ward with his staff, Thistlewood immediately
</p>
<p>stabbed him, and he fell on me. A pistol was
</p>
<p>then fired ; I know not by whom. 1 saw the
</p>
<p>swords of the party directed against the candles,
</p>
<p>which were immediately put out. Thistlewood
</p>
<p>stabbed the deceased in the right side as he ap-
</p>
<p>proached. He did not come out of the little room
</p>
<p>to do it. He was within the little room, and

<p>thrust forward his arm to strike the blo^v. I saw
</p>
<p>the sword he carried ; it was bright, and glittered.
</p>
<p>I did not see the hilt. It w^as a long Ijlade, three
</p>
<p>feet and a half or four feet lung. It apjieared
</p>
<p>straight ; but he waved it in such a way, that my
</p>
<p>eyes might have deceived me as to its shape.

<p>34 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>When Smithers fell, he fell upon me, being-
</p>
<p>stabbed on the right side, and I standing a little to
</p>
<p>his left. I could not at the moment tell whether he
</p>
<p>appeared to be much injured. In falling, he said,
</p>
<p>" Oh, Lord ! Oh, my God ! I am done I" I believe
</p>
<p>these were his words, or something of that sort.
</p>
<p>I don't know whether Thistlewood drew the
</p>
<p>weapon out of his body ; for instantaneously a
</p>
<p>pistol was fired, and the lights were put out. I
</p>
<p>have been enabled to recognise three of the per
</p>
<p>sons who were in the room, besides Thistlewood,
</p>
<p>I think, since. They are Shaw Strange ; he has
</p>
<p>another name; a man named Blackburn, and
</p>
<p>James Wilson. There was another man who
</p>
<p>stood at the door, and fired at a sergeant ; his name
</p>
<p>is Tidd : I don't know his christian name. The
</p>
<p>sergeant at whom he fired is present. Tidd first
</p>
<p>attempted to fire a pistol at Captain Fitzclarence.
</p>
<p>I seized his arm, and he pulled me down on him.
</p>
<p>I called on the sergeant to take the pistol from
</p>
<p>him, and he fired at the sergeant and tore his
</p>
<p>clothes. I am sure that Blackburn, Wilson, Shaw
</p>
<p>Strange, and Tidd, were present. There were
</p>
<p>also two other persons taken, who had been in
</p>
<p>this house (the Horse and Groom) in the course of
</p>
<p>the evening. I did not recognise them in the
</p>
<p>room ; but I know they were apprehended, and,
</p>
<p>I believe, admitted that they had been there.
</p>
<p>They left a stick behind them in the Horse and
</p>
<p>Groom ; the end of it was evidently cut for the
</p>
<p>purpose of holding a weapon.
</p>
<p>It was like a broom-stick, with a hole cut in the
</p>
<p>top. The persons that I allude to have admitted
</p>
<p>that they were in the room at the time the officers

</p>
<p>entered ; but I do not know it. One of them was
</p>
<p>taken by Captain Fitzclarence ; I have seen him
</p>
<p>here before. These two persons came in to drink
</p>
<p>a pint of porter, and left the stick behind them in
</p>
<p>a mistake. One of them came back, and asked
</p>
<p>for a little walking-stick. The boy, who thought
</p>
<p>INyUEST ON SMITHERS. 35
</p>
<p>it a queer sort of a stick, had taken it up-stairs,
</p>
<p>but returned it to the person who called for it.
</p>
<p>That stick was at the public-office. These per-
</p>
<p>sons called at the Horse and Groom an hour
</p>
<p>before the officers proceeded to the loft. Nothing
</p>
<p>took place before the party fired, except my
</p>
<p>exclaiming, '' We are officers  take their arms."
</p>
<p>When Smithers fell, a pistol was fired, and the
</p>
<p>lights were put out. I cannot say by whom the
</p>
<p>pistol was fired. The moment Smithers fell, some-
</p>
<p>body in the room where Thistlewood was, cried
</p>
<p>out  " Kill the b rs ; throw them down
</p>
<p>stairs !" I also cried, " Aye, kill them,"' that they
</p>
<p>might mistake me for a friend. There were nine
</p>
<p>persons taken that night. I was not present at
</p>
<p>the apprehension of all of them. While I was
</p>
<p>securing two of them the rest were brought in.
</p>
<p>After I had secured Tidd, Wilson, and Blackburn,
</p>
<p>I proceeded to secure the others ; they were then
</p>
<p>conveyed to Bow-street, and afterwards to the
</p>
<p>House of Correction.
</p>
<p>Several of the party escaped ; nine only being
</p>
<p>taken, and the number in the room appearing to
</p>
<p>me to be about twenty-five.
</p>
<p>When the prisoners were secured by the soldiers,
</p>
<p>I went up into the loft, and saw Smithers lying
</p>
<p>on his face ; this was twenty minutes or half an
</p>
<p>hour after the entrance had been made. There
</p>
<p>were hand-grenades and arms lying about the
</p>
<p>room. I had no time before to pay attention to
</p>
<p>Smithers. A man below stairs endeavoured to
</p>
<p>escape from the door ; he had a pistol in his
</p>
<p>hand. I called out, " Secure that man !"' When
</p>
<p>I did so, he lifted his arm, and attempted to fire

<p>the pistol at Captain Fitzclarence ; i caught hold
</p>
<p>of him, and the sergeant coming up, 1 desired him
</p>
<p>to take the pistol. The man fired, and struck the
</p>
<p>sergeant's coat with a bullet.
</p>
<p>1 believe only four of us got up. The party in
</p>
<p>the room fired directly at the staircase, thinkmg
</p>
<p>36 CATO-STREET CONSPIUACY.
</p>
<p>we were coming up in numbers. If they had not
</p>
<p>done so, they would have killed me, for I stood
</p>
<p>at one side of it.
</p>
<p>There was somebody below who I expected
</p>
<p>would take care of the sentinel ; but, m the con-
</p>
<p>fusion, he was handed from one to another, and
</p>
<p>thus escaped for a few minutes. It was quite
</p>
<p>dark, and I could not see the party escaping.
</p>
<p>There were, I think, twenty shots fired at us.
</p>
<p>It appeared to me as if some shots were fired
</p>
<p>from the window into the street to create alarm.
</p>
<p>The whole civil power present on the occasion
</p>
<p>was not more than twelve or fourteen men. I do
</p>
<p>not know the man who was acting as sentinel ; I
</p>
<p>believe his name is Davidson. He is a man of
</p>
<p>colour. I had not time to notice him particularly.
</p>
<p>I believe he was the man who was walking at the
</p>
<p>foot of the stairs, with a cutlass by his side, and a
</p>
<p>musket on his shoulder. I believe there was one
</p>
<p>light in the lower part of the building where he
</p>
<p>was. Some one, however, cried out, " They are
</p>
<p>up-stairs," and we heard the clashing of arms.
</p>
<p>1 cannot identify the man who was below stairs,
</p>
<p>I cannot swear to him. There was another officer
</p>
<p>shot on the left side of the head ; he was danger-
</p>
<p>ously wounded ; his name is Surman. Another
</p>
<p>officer, of the name of Westcott, had two or three
</p>
<p>shots through his hat. One of the bullets struck
</p>
<p>him on the finger, but did not hurt him mate-
</p>
<p>rially. 1 was not wounded at all. At the time I
</p>
<p>did not know friend from foe. Immediately when
</p>
<p>the party cried out, *' Kill the b s," I also
</p>
<p>said, ''Kill them," in order to deceive them. I
</p>
<p>had a brace of pistols ; one of them flashed in the

<p>pan. The lights being out, I was afterwards
</p>
<p>afraid to fire, lest I might kill one of my comrades.
</p>
<p>There was a latch to the door which led into the
</p>
<p>street, and I found no difticuity in getting in. I
</p>
<p>secured a cousiderable quantity of arms ; amongst
</p>
<p>the ie:-t there was a large grenade, and several
</p>
<p>INQUEST ON SMITHERS. 37
</p>
<p>hand-grenades. The large one consisted of a tin
</p>
<p>canister, with a plate at top, strengthened by
</p>
<p>several pieces of iron, and bound round with a
</p>
<p>quantity of tarred rope. I got eight of the hand-
</p>
<p>grenades ; they Mere about the size of my dou-
</p>
<p>bled fist. I also found in the room two swords,
</p>
<p>and some ball-cartridges, which are in my pos-
</p>
<p>session.
</p>
<p>The larg-e gTenade weig-hs fourteen or fifteen
</p>
<p>pounds, it is a canister strongly bound with tarred
</p>
<p>rope. It is not circular. A number of pistols,
</p>
<p>swords, cartridges, and bullets, were also found
</p>
<p>in the room.
</p>
<p>No person but Thistlewood offered violence
</p>
<p>before the candles were put out. There were
</p>
<p>likewise found in the room about three dozen of
</p>
<p>weapons, which resembled a sort of bayonet.
</p>
<p>The bottom part had not a socket like a bayonet,
</p>
<p>but a screw to fasten into a stick. I found also a
</p>
<p>dozen of sticks, formed ibr the purpose of being-
</p>
<p>fitted to those bayonets.
</p>
<p>The bayonets ajipeared to be newly made.
</p>
<p>They are very rough, and not at all briglitened or
</p>
<p>polished. The balls I picked up in the room were
</p>
<p>not fired from pistols. If they had, they would
</p>
<p>have been flattened ; I desired the men to ])ick
</p>
<p>the arms np, and each man to keep salVly what
</p>
<p>he found : in consequence, some where in the pos-
</p>
<p>session of one man, and some in that of another;
</p>
<p>two or three muskets were either found in the
</p>
<p>room, or else taken from some of the i)ersons who
</p>
<p>had been apprehended.
</p>
<p>The party had no notice but what I gave that
</p>
<p>we were officers.

<p>38 CATO-aTREET CONSPlRACr.
</p>
<p>I am also a constable. On Wednesday night last,
</p>
<p>about half-past seven o'clock, Mr. Stafford, the
</p>
<p>chief clerk at Bow-street, directed me to take
</p>
<p>Tiichard Smithers, John Surman, and William
</p>
<p>Gibbs, and to proceed in a coach with them to
</p>
<p>John-street, Edgeware-road, as fast as possible,
</p>
<p>there to meet Mr. Birnie, who would give us
</p>
<p>further orders. We did so ; and when we ar-
</p>
<p>rived at the spot, we found Mr. Birnie waiting.
</p>
<p>He inquired whether we had seen any thing of
</p>
<p>the military. We told him we had not. He said
</p>
<p>he expected them every minute. In about twenty
</p>
<p>minutes Mr. Birnie called us together. Some in-
</p>
<p>quiries were made, but 1 don't know of whom,
</p>
<p>as to what number were likely to be in the room
</p>
<p>to which we were going, and whether Arthur
</p>
<p>Thistlewood was to be there. Mr. Birnie gave me
</p>
<p>a warrant, signed by Mr. Baker, of Marlborough-
</p>
<p>street, to apprehend Arthur Thistlewood and thir-
</p>
<p>teen other persons named in it. I have not the
</p>
<p>warrant ; I have given it to Mr. Baker. On our
</p>
<p>being called together, and Mr. Birnie being given
</p>
<p>to understand that Thistlewood and others were
</p>
<p>in the room, he asked how many there might be
</p>
<p>present, and was informed that there was about a
</p>
<p>dozen. He then inquired how many there were
</p>
<p>of us. We told him about a dozen also. He said
</p>
<p>he had been disappointed in the soldiers, who had
</p>
<p>perhaps missed their way, and were half an hour
</p>
<p>too late, and that we must j)roceed to apprehend
</p>
<p>the parties. We said we would do the best we
</p>
<p>could. Smithers observed, if there were forty of
</p>
<p>them we would secure them. Mr. Birnie then
</p>
<p>directed me to call Ruthven, another officer, out

<p>of the Horse and Groom, and we were sent for-
</p>
<p>ward to the house, the military not having come
</p>
<p>in time, lluthven opened the door and went in ;
</p>
<p>it was a kind of stable where the meeting was
</p>
<p>held. lluthven went in first, I followed him.
</p>
<p>When I entered the stable I observed a man with
</p>
<p>IN'QUEST ON SMITHERS. 39
</p>
<p>belts on, a musket or fusil on his arm, and a sword
</p>
<p>at his side. I believe he held the musket in the
</p>
<p>position which soldiers do, when on duty. He
</p>
<p>was walking- backward and forward, Ruthven
</p>
<p>desired some person to take charge of him. I
</p>
<p>took him by the collar, turned him half round,
</p>
<p>and gave him to some other person, observing- at
</p>
<p>the same time that he was a man of colour. At
</p>
<p>that moment Ruthven was at the foot of the lad-
</p>
<p>der, up which he went. I followed as closely as
</p>
<p>I possibly could, and was immediately followed by
</p>
<p>Smithers. Before I got up the ladder, I heard a
</p>
<p>clattering of swords. I heard Ruthven say at
</p>
<p>that moment, " We are officers, seize their arms,''
</p>
<p>or " lay down your arms," I cannot tell which.
</p>
<p>Upon gaining the top of the ladder, Ruthven turned
</p>
<p>a little to the left, to go round a table or carpen-
</p>
<p>ter's bench. I observed a number of men falling
</p>
<p>back to the other end of the room. They were
</p>
<p>apparently all armed. I also saw^ three or four
</p>
<p>men backing into the little room on the right.
</p>
<p>They were all armed with swords or cutlasses.
</p>
<p>A tall man immediately brandished a sword at me :
</p>
<p>his foot was advanced in a fencing attitude, as if
</p>
<p>he meant to stab. 1 held up my staff in my left
</p>
<p>hand, and presented a pistol at him with my right ;
</p>
<p>I held up my staff that he might see it, to shew
</p>
<p>him what I was. The light was then as good as
</p>
<p>it is here : it was very lightsome : 1 desired the
</p>
<p>man to desist, or I certainly would fire. I did not

<p>furtlier room to the right. There was another
</p>
<p>closet near to the ladder, which was not discovered
</p>
<p>nor opened for half an hour afterwards. No one
</p>
<p>was found there. Smithers rushed past, and en-
</p>
<p>deavoured to get into the little room. I saw the
</p>
<p>tall man draw his hand back, and make a thrust
</p>
<p>40 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>of a sword at him, which I saw strike him on the
</p>
<p>breast.
</p>
<p>It was the same tall man, Thistlewood, who had
</p>
<p>flourished his sword at me. The manner in which
</p>
<p>he did it made me fix my eyes on him, so as to
</p>
<p>mark the kind of countenance he had. Smithers,
</p>
<p>on being struck, immediately threw up his hands,
</p>
<p>fell towards me, and exclaimed, " Oh ! my God !"
</p>
<p>I instantly fired at the man who killed Smithers,
</p>
<p>but I missed him. Smithers fell against me at
</p>
<p>the time, so as to drive me to the head of the
</p>
<p>stairs. A rush was then made by the party, and
</p>
<p>I was knocked down from tlie top to the bottom
</p>
<p>of the ladder. The moment I fired, the candles
</p>
<p>were all put out with the swords.
</p>
<p>I think there were four or five and twenty per-
</p>
<p>sons present. There were four or five in the
</p>
<p>small room. The time was so short that very
</p>
<p>little observation could be made. I ran to the
</p>
<p>door, when two or three shots were fired in the
</p>
<p>stable below, where I was. I don't know by
</p>
<p>whom they were fired. It was in the dark, and 1
</p>
<p>could not discover friend from foe. I do not know
</p>
<p>that any officer fired except myself. I have not
</p>
<p>heard of such a thing. When I arrived at the
</p>
<p>door, I heard a cry of " Stop him," and instantly
</p>
<p>saw a man running at the other side of the street ;
</p>
<p>I pursued, and took him in the street, about twenty
</p>
<p>yards from the door. When laying hold of him,
</p>
<p>he made a cut at me with a long sword. This was
</p>
<p>the man of colour. I received a cut, a very slight
</p>
<p>one, in the leg. I think it was when his arm, in
</p>
<p>striking at me, swung round my neck, that the
</p>
<p>sword, which was a very long one, hit my leg.

<p>The man's name is Davidson. I believe him to
</p>
<p>be the same man who kept the door, but I will
</p>
<p>not positively swear to that. I took him to a
</p>
<p>shop at the corner, and seized his fusil, which was
</p>
<p>that of a light-horseman, but perhaps rather
</p>
<p>heavier.
</p>
<p>INQUEST ON SMITIIKRS. 4-1
</p>
<p>I have seen Thistlewood, and I believe him to
</p>
<p>be the raan that struck Smithers. I did not know
</p>
<p>him at the time. I saw him for six or seven se-
</p>
<p>conds, or more, when he brandished his sword at
</p>
<p>me, until he went towards the little room. On
</p>
<p>seeinsf that, Smithers rushed forward, and the
</p>
<p>moment he got near the door, I saw him struck.
</p>
<p>I was sure that he was killed. It was a stab  a
</p>
<p>thrust  he received. The sword was long, very
</p>
<p>bright, and triflingly turned at the end. It seeme'd
</p>
<p>sharp on both sides. He brandished it at me.
</p>
<p>The whole space of this t^ime was not more than
</p>
<p>ten or twelve seconds. 1 saw the man with his
</p>
<p>sword, before I got to the top of the ladder. As
</p>
<p>soon as Davidson was secured, I returned to the
</p>
<p>place, and I then found the military had come. I
</p>
<p>left Davidson in a shop, with two of our people to
</p>
<p>take care of him. The prisoners were all dis-
</p>
<p>armed, and I proceeded to tie them together. I
</p>
<p>was only a few minutes gone when I took David-
</p>
<p>son. 1 stayed as little time as I possibly could.
</p>
<p>As soon as I had tied the prisoners 1 went to
</p>
<p>Smithers ; he was lying on his face. I turned
</p>
<p>him up, and I believe he breathed faintly. I
</p>
<p>afterwards found a pistol, a bayonet, a quantity
</p>
<p>of ball cartridges, and several bullets. Many
</p>
<p>other weapons were found by the officers.
</p>
<p>1 am most positive of the identity of Thistle-
</p>
<p>wood. I feel no hesitation on the subject.
</p>

</p>
<p>Avhich he had taken to the Jury.]

</p>
<p>of the room when Smithers })assed me. I had my

<p>eyes fixed on Thistlewood, when he was brandish-

</p>
<p>I could not recognise any of the others. I saw
</p>
<p>liim for eight or ten seconds, but I cannot speak
</p>
<p>to his dress: it was a dark dress, but I cannot
</p>
<p>speak to it distinctly. I heard yesterday, that
</p>
<p>Thistlewood was the person who struck the blow,

</p>
<p>42 CATO -STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>but that did not affect my opinion. I would have
</p>
<p>sworn to him, if it had not been mentioned.
</p>
<p>There were several persons wounded. An officer
</p>
<p>named Biggs was wounded. The place where
</p>
<p>the business ocurred is not ten yards from this.
</p>
<p>It is the first stable down the yard, and is, I think,
</p>
<p>on the north side of the street. When I fell down
</p>
<p>the ladder, I fell on some of the officers who were
</p>
<p>coming up. I should have been shot if I had not
</p>
<p>so fallen. There were several shots fired in the
</p>
<p>stable. I had a cutlass by my side, but could not
</p>
<p>use it. The flashes were numerous below, but I
</p>
<p>could not see who or what they were who fired.
</p>
<p>In the confusion Davidson escaped, but I after-
</p>
<p>wards took him. When I came back there were
</p>
<p>several persons in custody. There were many
</p>
<p>shots fired from the window.
</p>
<p>We officers carry cutlasses, but they could be
</p>
<p>of no use against the length of the swords which
</p>
<p>the party made use of.
</p>
<p>I cannot state the specific words of the warrant.
</p>
<p>It was given to me in the street by Mr. Birnie,
</p>
<p>and has been placed in the hands of Mr. Baker,
</p>
<p>the magistrate.
</p>
<p>The Coroner inquired of Pyall, the beadle,
</p>
<p>whether he had the warrant in his possession, and
</p>
<p>was answered in the negative.
</p>
<p>The Witness .  The warrant was in my posses-
</p>
<p>sion ; it authorized us to apprehend Arthur This-
</p>
<p>tlewood and thirteen other persons named in it,
</p>
<p>for unlawfully assembling together, but for what
</p>
<p>specific purpose I cannot say, and to bring then*
</p>
<p>before the sitting magistrate, to be dealt with
</p>
<p>according to law.

<p>Pyall, the beadle, was despatched to Mr.

<p>ster, and am one of the assistant patrol of Bow-
</p>
<p>street.  On Wednesday night last, I was sent to
</p>
<p>the stable in Cato-street, by order of Mr. Birnie.
</p>
<p>1 accompanied Ruthven, Ellis, Smithers, and
</p>
<p>others to the spot. Ruthven went first, and I
</p>
<p>followed Smithers. I was behind him in the
</p>
<p>stable. The moment Ruthven, Ellis, and Smithers
</p>
<p>had gone up the ladder leading to the loft, I
</p>
<p>seized a man in the stable below dressed like a
</p>
<p>butcher. His name 1 believe was Ings.  When
</p>
<p>I entered, he rushed out against me : and finding-
</p>
<p>resistance, put his hand to his belt, as if to
</p>
<p>pull something out of it. I immediately knocked
</p>
<p>him down by hitting him on the right eye. He
</p>
<p>was dressed in a long coat beneath his jacket, and
</p>
<p>had an apron over the whole. This happened be-
</p>
<p>fore the first pistol was fired, and 1 was in the act
</p>
<p>of handcuffing him when I heard a fresh pistol
</p>
<p>fired in the loft. 1 had not quite succeeded before
</p>
<p>Thistiewood came down the ladder, and as he
</p>
<p>was upon the steps fired a pistol ; whether levelled
</p>
<p>at me or not I cannot say. Seeing me so busily en-
</p>
<p>gaged in securing the butcher, he levelled another
</p>
<p>shot at my head, and at the same time made
</p>
<p>several cuts at me with a sabre. The pistol went
</p>
<p>off, and the shot penetrated my hat. 1 knocked
</p>
<p>him down with the stick 1 had in my hand, but
</p>
<p>he rose and succeeded in making his escape.
</p>
<p>While I was engaged with Thistiewood, Ings con-
</p>
<p>trived to make his escape also ; when Thistiewood
</p>
<p>was gone, I found that I was wounded in the,
</p>
<p>hand, and that some shot had gone through the
</p>
<p>flap of my coat. In the mean time both Thistle-
</p>
<p>wood and Ings succeeded in getting away. I pur-

<p>sued Thistiewood, but in vain, and after having
</p>
<p>followed him through several streets, 1 returned
</p>
<p>to the stable. I then went into the loft, and saw
</p>
<p>the deceased lying dead on the floor. There

<p>were several persons present, and the prisoners

<p>wcod was the first who came down the steps? 
</p>
<p>There was a complete rush, and I did not par-
</p>
<p>ticularly observe whether he did or not. Did he
</p>
<p>come down before the officer Smithers fell?  I
</p>
<p>did not see the officer fall. You went with the
</p>
<p>whole body of the officers ?  Yes, I did. There
</p>
<p>were only three officers, I understand, in the loft ?
</p>
<p> I believe no more. Where were the others ?
</p>
<p> They were upon the scout. Then I under-
</p>
<p>stand that after the three officers mentioned had
</p>
<p>gone up, Thistlewood came down, and prevented

<p>others from ascending the steps? Yes; and he

<p>fired down the steps to prevent the ascent of

<p>others.

</p>
<p>Wednesday night, about half-past eight, I appre-
</p>
<p>hended Ings, while Brooks was in pursuit of him.
</p>
<p>He fired at Brooks ; but I cannot say what fire-
</p>
<p>arms he used, as he threw it down before I
</p>
<p>reached him. Brooks cried out. Stop thief! and
</p>
<p>I immediately apprehended him. The ball went
</p>
<p>through the coat and waistcoat of Brooks, and
</p>
<p>grazed the top of his shoulder. I took Ings down
</p>
<p>to Mary-le-bone watch-house, assisted by Brooks
</p>
<p>and another officer. I searched him, and found
</p>
<p>seven or eight bullets in his pockets, some gun-
</p>
<p>powder in a tin flasket, and a haversack. He had

<p>a kind of belt on each side for pistols.

<p>strcet, Edgware-road. I was then quartered in
</p>
<p>Portman-street barracks. A picket, usually em-
</p>
<p>ployed on occasions wlien the military is required
</p>
<p>in aid of tlic civil power, was ordered out. it
</p>
<p>was commanded by Ca})tain Fitzclarencc. Upon
</p>
<p>arrivinrr at Jolm-strcet, we were unable to asccr-
</p>
<p>INQl KSl 0\ SMITH r.KS. 45
</p>
<p>tain the spot whither we ought to proceed, and
</p>
<p>the captain advanced to ascertain what we were
</p>
<p>to do. When he returned, he ordered the picket
</p>
<p>to advance at double quick time. Upon reaching
</p>
<p>the stable in Cato-street, I observed a man stand-
</p>
<p>ing- with a pistol in his hand. He presented it at
</p>
<p>Captain Fitzclarence, and I knocked it aside with
</p>
<p>my pike. 1 then seized the muzzle-end of the pis-
</p>
<p>tol with my hand, and a scuffle ensued between the
</p>
<p>man and myself about the pistol. I kept firm hold
</p>
<p>of it till it went off, and the ball passing by my arm,
</p>
<p>tore the cloth off my sleeve. (Witness here ex-
</p>
<p>hibited the sleeve of his coat, w4iich appeared to
</p>
<p>be very much torn.) In wrestling with the pri-
</p>
<p>soner, I held my face down to the lock of the pistol,
</p>
<p>and as it went off the ball grazed ray right eye-
</p>
<p>brow. As soon as the pistol was discharged, the
</p>
<p>prisoner let go his liold. I secured him, and de-
</p>
<p>livered him over to the police. I believe the
</p>
<p>prisoner's name is Tidd. After this skirmish I
</p>
<p>followed my oHicer and ])art of the picket up the
</p>
<p>steps into the loft. The greater part of the picket
</p>
<p>had reached the loft before I was disenaaoed
</p>
<p>from the jirisoner. When I had reached the loft
</p>
<p>I discovered a table in the centre of it, nearly
</p>
<p>covered with pistols, blunderbusses, ammunition,
</p>
<p>and other arms of various descriptions. Three
</p>
<p>men had then surrendered ; I think their names
</p>
<p>were Monument, Cooper, and Gilchrist. 1 do
</p>
<p>not recollect wdiat police-ofhcers were })resent at
</p>
<p>the time. Upon looking on the floor, I saw the
</p>
<p>deceased lying dead at my feet. His body was
</p>
<p>examined by the picket, and I perceived the
</p>
<p>wound on his right breast. I was ordered back

<p>to the barracks lor a reinforcement, and when 1
</p>
<p>returned, the whole of the prisoners taken that
</p>
<p>moment were collected into the loft. Upon the
</p>
<p>arrival of the reinforcement, the prisoners were
</p>
<p>conveyed to Bow-street.
</p>
<p>Here one of the jury observed, that the inquest
</p>
<p>46 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>had proceeded far enough to ascertain the acts of
</p>
<p>Thistlewood. The Coroner replied, that those
</p>
<p>who were aiding and abetting in the murder were
</p>
<p>equally guilty as the principal ; and it would be
</p>
<p>necessary to ascertain who they were, and what
</p>
<p>they did.
</p>
<p>Here the examination was interrupted by the
</p>
<p>arrival of a messenger, with a letter from Mr.
</p>
<p>Baker, the magistrate, to the Coroner. It was
</p>
<p>read aloud, and was to the following effect : 
</p>
<p>" I beg to inform you, that I granted a warrant
</p>
<p>on Wednesday the 23d instant, for the appre-
</p>
<p>hension of Arthur Thistlewood, and several others,
</p>
<p>on a charge of felony, and that I afterwards re-
</p>
<p>ceived from Mr. Ellis an order to lay it before
</p>
<p>the Privy-Council on the examination of the pri-
</p>
<p>soners when in custody. It has not yet been
</p>
<p>returned to me, nor do I think that I shall be
</p>
<p>able to obtain it at the present moment. Perhaps
</p>
<p>it would be better to adjourn the inquest for the
</p>
<p>present, and I will endeavour to get it for you
</p>
<p>to-morrow, or send you the information, on which
</p>
<p>it was issued."
</p>
<p>William Sarmon.  I live in Edgeware-road,
</p>
<p>and am a tailor by trade. On Wednesday night,
</p>
<p>about eight o'clock, I was passing through Cato-
</p>
<p>street, and when opposite to the stable I heard
</p>
<p>Westcott say that Smithers had been stabbed.
</p>
<p>In two or three minutes afterwards two men
</p>
<p>rushed out of the stable. One of the two cut me
</p>
<p>with a sabre on the hat. He was a tall man dressed
</p>
<p>in a dark coat. He struck at me twice, and
</p>
<p>hit my thigh, but fortunately did not wound
</p>
<p>me. I was so frightened at the moment, that I

</p>
<p>could not tell which way he ran, and I did not
</p>
<p>stop to look. There were many people in the
</p>
<p>street at the time. I do not know the appearance
</p>
<p>of Thistlewood. I only observed that the man
</p>
<p>who struck me was of a pale complexion, and
</p>
<p>wore a dark long: coat. The other man who ac-
</p>
<p>INQUKST ON SMITH ERS. 47
</p>
<p>companied him out of the stable did not attempt
</p>
<p>to strike me. They both passed behind me on
</p>
<p>the right hand, I think, through the gateway
</p>
<p>towards John-street. I heard several shots within
</p>
<p>the building, while I was standing opposite the
</p>
<p>stable. That night I wore a loose coat, and by
</p>
<p>that means I was not wounded. I saw Westcott
</p>
<p>go into the stable, and I knew him well. I had
</p>
<p>seen him many times before.
</p>
<p>Here the examniation of the witnesses ter-
</p>
<p>minated, and the Coroner expressed a wish to
</p>
<p>receive some information respecting the christian
</p>
<p>names of those who had been described as having
</p>
<p>been apprehended in the stable. He thought
</p>
<p>there was no distinction between the case of
</p>
<p>Thistlewood and the other prisoners; they all
</p>
<p>entertained the same mischievous design, and
</p>
<p>shewed their purpose but too plainly, in being so
</p>
<p>well furnished with fire-arms, hand-grenades, <^'c.
</p>
<p>He wished to know whether the gentlemen of the
</p>
<p>Jury were satisfied with the evidence already
</p>
<p>received.
</p>
<p>A jurpiian said, he wished to put a question to
</p>
<p>Ruthveu, the officer, before the verdict was pro-
</p>
<p>nounced ; but Mr, Pyall, the summoning officer,
</p>
<p>stated, that Ruthven had gone away, notwith-
</p>
<p>standing his particular request that he should
</p>
<p>remain.
</p>
<p>The Coroner wished to know whether any of
</p>
<p>the Jury required an adjournment of the inquest;
</p>
<p>if they did, he would willingly attend to their
</p>
<p>request. The Jury unanimously declared that they
</p>
<p>were satisfied ; and the Coroner, in a formal
</p>
<p>manner, asked, " Is Arthur Thistlewood guilty or

<p>he thought of some importance, before the verdict

<p>was pronounced upon ail the prisoners. He wished
</p>
<p>to know whether those who might have met for a
</p>
<p>different purpose were equally guilty of the mur-
</p>
<p>der with Thistlewood ?
</p>
<p>The Coroner replied, that there could be no
</p>
<p>doubt that they were implicated in the murder as
</p>
<p>much as Thistlewood himself, for whatever illegal

<p>purpose they might have met. They had impeded

<p>would probably have acted in the same manner.
</p>
<p>Another Jiiri/man.  But are those who surren-
</p>
<p>dered themselves equally guilty ?
</p>
<p>Coroner.  There can be no doubt of it. They
</p>
<p>were all assembled for one common purpose, and
</p>
<p>the act of one is the act of the whole. It is clearly
</p>
<p>murder in them all. If a man intends to do a
</p>
<p>mischief to another, and, instead of killing him,
</p>
<p>happens to kill a second, it is equally murder, as
</p>
<p>if he had killed the man he intended.
</p>
<p>A Juri/man.  Another doubt arises in my mind.
</p>
<p>Had not these men a right to defend themselves,
</p>
<p>after the pistol had been fired by the officer Ellis ?
</p>
<p>Coroner.  Certainly not ; there cannot be a
</p>
<p>doubt upon it.
</p>
<p>The jury, by their foreman, then pronounced a
</p>
<p>verdict of '' Gidllij of Murder * against the follow-
</p>
<p>ing prisoners: .James Ings ; Charles Cooper;
</p>
<p>Richard Tidd ; John Monument ; John Charles
</p>
<p>Strange ; Richard Blackburn ; James Wilson ;
</p>
<p>James Gilchrist ; and others unknown.

<p>Tn the course of the day, the afflicted parents of
</p>
<p>the deceased visited the body, and showed much
</p>
<p>feeling upon the occasion. The old couple were
</p>
<p>Ro decrepit as scarcely to be able to get up stairs.
</p>
<p>Smithers was a stout, good-looking man, about
</p>
<p>thirty-tiiree years of age.
</p>
<p>KUNKRAL 01 tJMI'i HERli. 4^
</p>
<p>In addition to the wound that was the immedi-
</p>
<p>ate cause of the death of Smithers, it was found
</p>
<p>that a pistol bullet had penetrated his shoulder
</p>
<p>nearly six inches. It was extracted by Bennett,
</p>
<p>and was found to have been cast from pewter.
</p>
<p>A second sabre wound was also found under his
</p>
<p>blade-bone. In what manner these wounds were
</p>
<p>intlicted, there are no means of knowing, but it is
</p>
<p>supposed they occurred after his fall.
</p>
<p>On Thursday afternoon, the i2d of March, at four
</p>
<p>o'clock, his remains were removed from his lodgings
</p>
<p>in Carteret-street, in the Broadway, Westminster,
</p>
<p>and buried in the church-yard of St. Margaret's,
</p>
<p>Westminster, amidst a great concourse of sympa-
</p>
<p>thizing spectators. It was too trying a task for
</p>
<p>his widow to undertake to follow him to the
</p>
<p>grave, and she was prevailed on not to attempt
</p>
<p>it. The deceased's father and brothers followed
</p>
<p>as principal mourners. They were succeeded by
</p>
<p>some private friends, and a numerous assemblage
</p>
<p>of officers and others belonging to Bovv'-street
</p>
<p>office ; Mr. John Lavender, belonging to Queen-
</p>
<p>square police-office, to which the deceased for-
</p>
<p>merly belonged; Mr. Armstrong and his son,
</p>
<p>both officers belonging to the police-office in W^or-
</p>
<p>ship-street; making in the whole 67 persons;
</p>
<p>thus showing the last mark of respect to a de-
</p>
<p>parted officer, who had fallen a sacrifice by the
</p>
<p>hands of a ferocious assassin.
</p>
<p>The procession passed through the following
</p>
<p>streets ; the windows of each house were filled
</p>
<p>with spectators of both sexes ;  Tothill-street,
</p>
<p>Dartmouth-street, Great and Little Queen-streets,
</p>
<p>Great George-street, and through the grand open-

</p>
<p>ing leading to St. Margaret's-cliurch. The rush
</p>
<p>from the crowd to gain admittance into the latter
</p>
<p>})lace was astonishing; but no accident occurred.
</p>
<p>The service was performed by the Rev. Mr. Rod-
</p>
<p>ber. The church-yard was filled with an immense
</p>
<p>crowd of persons of all descriptions, among^
</p>
<p>2. M
</p>
<p>which were numerous soldiers belonging to the
</p>
<p>Guards. A general regret and pity seemed to
</p>
<p>pervade the whole of this vast assemblage at the
</p>
<p>melancholy fate of this unfortunate man. The
</p>
<p>procession then returned through Tothill-street
</p>
<p>to Carteret-street, when the officers returned to
</p>
<p>the undertaker's. The whole of this funeral was
</p>
<p>conducted in the most decorous manner ; and se-
</p>
<p>veral magistrates were amongst the spectators.
</p>
<p>On Sunday, the 27th of February, at one
</p>
<p>o'clock, the Cabinet Council assembled at the se-
</p>
<p>cretary of state's office for the home department,
</p>
<p>to proceed with the investigation of the charges
</p>
<p>against the assassins. Their lordships were as-
</p>
<p>sisted by the law officers.
</p>
<p>Robert Adams, late a private of the Royal
</p>
<p>Horse-Guards, and who had become king's evi-
</p>
<p>dence, was examined before their lordships, which
</p>
<p>occupied their time till half-past two o'clock,
</p>
<p>which was then too late an hour to proceed with
</p>
<p>the examination of Abel Hall, a tailor, who had
</p>
<p>been apprehended on Saturday morning by La-
</p>
<p>vender, Bishop, and Salmon, the officers, in
</p>
<p>Seward-street, Chiswell-street.
</p>
<p>A quantity of ball-cartridges, a musket, and a
</p>
<p>cavalry sword, which they found concealed in a
</p>
<p>ruinous shed at the back of a small house near
</p>
<p>the Regent's park, were this day produced. The
</p>
<p>woman occupying the house was also brought up,
</p>
<p>but after a short examination she was discharged.
</p>
<p>It did not appear that she had any knowledge of
</p>
<p>these things being on her premises. These ar-
</p>
<p>ticles appear to have been deposited in the place
</p>
<p>where they were found by some of the conspi-
</p>
<p>rators in their retreat.

<p>On Monday, the 28th of February, the Privy-
</p>
<p>Council again met, and on this day a proclamation
</p>
<p>was placarded in different parts of London, of-
</p>
<p>firring a reward cf 200/. for the apprehension of
</p>
<p>tUSPncTED PKROMi. Sl
</p>
<p>John Pa lix, alias Peeli no, who had been charged
</p>
<p>with hig-h treason. He was described as being a
</p>
<p>child's chair-maker, and as having- been formerly
</p>
<p>a corporal in the East London iMilitia, and about
</p>
<p>forty years of age.
</p>
<p>Private information was the same eveninir ^jiven
</p>
<p>to I^avender and Bishop, tliat Palin, for whose
</p>
<p>apprehension the reward of 200/. had been offered,
</p>
<p>was concealed in a house in the neighbourhood of
</p>
<p>Battle-bridge. They proceeded inniiediaLcly with
</p>
<p>their informer to the spot described, but found
</p>
<p>that there was no ground for the suspicion which
</p>
<p>liad arisen. Though the officers did not find
</p>
<p>Palin, they found three men and a woman of
</p>
<p>somewhat suspicious appearance. One man was
</p>
<p>in bed, and said he was unwell. The patrol
</p>
<p>suspecting him to be one of the Cato-street gang
</p>
<p>of assassins, and that he was in bed in conse-
</p>
<p>quence of the bruises he had received, made him
</p>
<p>get u]), when he was found to have all his clothes
</p>
<p>on cxce])t his shoes. They stripped him, but he
</p>
<p>had no bruises. The other two men were melt-
</p>
<p>ing lead in a frying-pan. One of the men lived
</p>
<p>at that place, the others in Monmouth-street and
</p>
<p>Brownlow-street. They were all three brought
</p>
<p>to the office, and underwent an examination be-
</p>
<p>fore Mr. Birnie, when there being no charge
</p>
<p>against them, and they not being known, they
</p>
<p>were discharged. It is supposed that Palin
</p>
<p>might have taken the alarm, and escaped at the
</p>
<p>back of the house while the officers were knock-
</p>
<p>ing at the door.
</p>
<p>The notorious Preston, the cobbling politician,
</p>
<p>of Spa-fields' memory, was also this day arrested

</p>
<p>on suspicion of being concerned in the plot,
</p>
<p>under a warrant issued by R. Birnie, Esq. It
</p>
<p>a])pears that the lodgings of this man were
</p>
<p>searched a few days before, but nothing of
</p>
<p>a suspicious nature was found. On those oc-
</p>
<p>casions he facetiously said  " his armory could
</p>
<p>H2
</p>
<p>52 tATO-STREE'r CONiSPIHACY.
</p>
<p>not boast of a swan-shot, nor his port-folio of a
</p>
<p>scrap of paper of the slightest political interest."
</p>
<p>Circumstances afterwards transpired which led to
</p>
<p>his arrest upon a charge of high treason. He
</p>
<p>was found industriously engaged in mending a
</p>
<p>shoe, with his family about him. He was sur-
</p>
<p>prised at this new visit, but submitted to his
</p>
<p>fate with cheeriulness, not unaccompanied by an
</p>
<p>apparent sense of his own importance. His
</p>
<p>daugliters were highly indignant at this intrusion
</p>
<p>on their domestic privacy- The officers con-
</p>
<p>ducted their prisoner to Bow-street office, from
</p>
<p>whence he was sent to the Marquis of Anglesea
</p>
<p>public-house opposite. He was placed under the
</p>
<p>care of Leick, one of the patrol. He called for
</p>
<p>'* a pipe and pot," and, seating himself before
</p>
<p>the fire, seemed perfectly happy. He laughingly
</p>
<p>said to a gentleman who went to see him, that
</p>
<p>he thought " the farce would not be complete
</p>
<p>till he was taken." He had previously denied all
</p>
<p>knowledge of the late conspiracy. After being
</p>
<p>shortly examined before Mr. Birnie, he was sent
</p>
<p>to Covent-garden watch-house, where he re-
</p>
<p>mained in confinement during that night. On
</p>
<p>the following morning he was removed from that
</p>
<p>place of confinement to the secretary of state's
</p>
<p>office for the home department, where, at twelve
</p>
<p>o'clock, the Lords of the Council assembled, con-
</p>
<p>sisting of the Cabinet Ministers, the Marquis of
</p>
<p>Camden, Mr. Peel, Sir William Scott, Sir John
</p>
<p>NichoUs, Mr. Sturges Bourne, together with the
</p>
<p>Attorney and Solicitor-Generals, and other law
</p>
<p>officers.

<p>council, attended to take the minutes of the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings. When Preston w^as taken in before
</p>
<p>the Lords of the Council he behaved with his
</p>
<p>usual boldness and low insolence to most of their
</p>
<p>lordships ])ersonally. He called upon them with
</p>
<p>the most ludicrously impudent arrogance, and
</p>
<p>SUSPECTED PERSONSr Cj2
</p>
<p>asked what they meant by sending for him to dis-
</p>
<p>turb his peace of mind, and to disturb the eco-
</p>
<p>nomy of his family, alhiding to liis three daughters
</p>
<p>binding shoes, and himself making them.
</p>
<p>The examination of this impudent fellow lasted
</p>
<p>about half an hour, after which he was committed
</p>
<p>to Tothillfields-bridewell in the custody of two of
</p>
<p>the Bow-street officers. When he returned from
</p>
<p>the Council Chamber he was almost breathless,
</p>
<p>and gasped out to those about him  " Bless me,
</p>
<p>how 1 perspire ! but I always do when 1 have
</p>
<p>any thing like a subject to speak upon." Whilst
</p>
<p>his commitment was making out, he requested
</p>
<p>to be assisted with a little porter. Some porter
</p>
<p>was given to him, and whilst he was drinking it
</p>
<p>Lord Castlereagh passed through the hall, when
</p>
<p>Preston observed, " Aye, there he goes ! His
</p>
<p>lordship will remember what I have said to him
</p>
<p>as long as he lives. I have talked more treason,
</p>
<p>as they call it, to-day, than ever I did in my
</p>
<p>whole life before." The porter seemed to inspire
</p>
<p>him, and he was proceeding with more remarks,
</p>
<p>when the officers received his commitment, and
</p>
<p>he was led to the coach which was to convey
</p>
<p>him to prison. A number of gentlemen were
</p>
<p>assembled in the hall ; and, as he passed through
</p>
<p>the midst of them, he bowed and smiled on all
</p>
<p>sides, repeatedly saying, "God bless you all."
</p>
<p>In the course of the day an application was
</p>
<p>made at the police-office, 13ow-street, by one of
</p>
<p>Preston's daughters, to be allowed to see her
</p>
<p>father, and to deliver him some clean linen ; she
</p>
<p>was referred by the magistrate to Lord Sidmouth,
</p>
<p>and accordingly wrote the following letter to his

<p>Lordship, which she carried to the office of the
</p>
<p>Home Department, and delivered it to one of the
</p>
<p>messengers, while she waited in the hall for an
</p>
<p>answer : 
</p>
<p>" My Lord,  I entreat your Lordship to allow
</p>
<p>an agonized daughter to have an interview with

</p>
<p>her father, who was dragged from home, and his
</p>
<p>family, consisting of three daughters besides
</p>
<p>myself, totally unprotected, on a charge of which
</p>
<p>he is completely innocent, and of which he has no
</p>
<p>knowledge whatever. My father's house was
</p>
<p>searched four times successively on four different
</p>
<p>davs, and nothins: was found that could at all
</p>
<p>criminate him in the late dreadful proceedings.
</p>
<p>** I have called at Bow- street for the purpose
</p>
<p>of giving my father some linen, and also to know
</p>
<p>if he could be held to bail, and have been re-
</p>
<p>ferred to your Lordship. I am now waiting in
</p>
<p>the lobby of the Home Department Office with
</p>
<p>the linen to give to my father ; and I hope your

<p>" To Lord Fiscoimt Sidmoiith, &c. &.c."
</p>
<p>After being absent some time, the messenger
</p>
<p>who carried the letter to his Lordship returned,
</p>
<p>and told her she must call again on the following
</p>
<p>day for an answer. She then inquired where her
</p>
<p>father was, and was informed that he had been
</p>
<p>examined that day before the Privy-Counci-l, and
</p>
<p>had been committed. She then left the office in
</p>
<p>tears.
</p>
<p>The next morning she waited at the office of the
</p>
<p>Home Department, as she had been directed, for
</p>
<p>an answer to her application. She saw JMr. Hob-
</p>

<p>she would call again on the Saturday, she avouIU

<p>probably have an order to see him. She waited
</p>
<p>in the lobby until her father was brought out, after
</p>
<p>his examination before the Privy-Council, and he
</p>
<p>looked very anxiously at her ; but they were not
</p>
<p>allowed to speak to each other. She h?d a bundle
</p>
<p>of linen ; and, when her father was conveved to
</p>

</p>
<p>Tothill-fields prison, she followed him, iind j^ave
</p>
<p>the linen to the governor.
</p>
<p>About this time Waddixgto.v, the fellow who
</p>
<p>had been brou:;ht into some notoriety, by his arrest
</p>
<p>for being the bearer of a j)lacard, the object of
</p>
<p>which was to create an unlawful assembly on
</p>
<p>Kennington Common, appeared before Mr. Hicks,
</p>
<p>the sitting magistrate at Bow-street, and with
</p>
<p>ridiculous effrontery, stated that the reason of
</p>
<p>his calling was to..say that the officers had seized
</p>
<p>his books and papers, which they were very
</p>
<p>welcome to do, as he had nothing in his possession
</p>
<p>that he was ashamed of, or that could lead to
</p>
<p>any charge. His landlady, who \vas present
</p>
<p>when his place was searched for books and
</p>
<p>papers, told him that the officers had left a
</p>
<p>message, desiring him to attend at the office, a.s
</p>
<p>he was wanted there ; and he consequently at-
</p>
<p>tended.
</p>
<p>Mr. Hicks, the magistrate, professed hinaself
</p>
<p>unacquainted with the affair ; but desired that
</p>
<p>inquiries should be made, and it turned out that
</p>
<p>some of the ])ol!ce-officers had seari-hed his
</p>
<p>lodgings, and had sciz.ed his books and papers;
</p>
<p>but they denied having left any message for his
</p>
<p>appearance at the office, and there was no doubt
</p>
<p>but that it was a mistake of his landlady in
</p>
<p>relating to him what had passed.
</p>
<p>The magistrate informed him that he had no
</p>
<p>charge against him. Waddington withdrew from
</p>
<p>the office, after tellhig the magistrate that he
</p>
<p>might always be found when wanted.
</p>
<p>We are happy, however, to announce that tins

</p>
<p>cause, however, it was su])p(jscd possible that he

<p>might ha\e afforded shelter to some of his quon-

<p>dam friends, and accordingly the officers were

<p>of himself, blowing a horn, carrying a large bundle

<p>of twopenny trash under his arm, and in his hat a

<p>paper, inscribed " Order, order ! Public Meeting
</p>
<p>in Smithfield on Wednesday next.^' Underneath
</p>
<p>was written " Samuel Waddington, printer and

</p>
<p>Having had occasion to introduce the names of

<p>these men, who have lately forced themselves

<p>on the notice of the Public by their absurd, but

</p>
<p>not be thought altogether irrelevant if we intro-
</p>
<p>duce a description of the Radical Committee Room,
</p>
<p>at the White Lion, Wych-street, this being the ren-
</p>
<p>dezvous, or place of meeting, where these self-
</p>
<p>elected Radical Committees held their nightly
</p>
<p>meetings.
</p>
<p>The White Lion was a public-house, but has
</p>
<p>very properly been deprived of its hcense by
</p>
<p>the Magistrates. It is situated a short distance
</p>
<p>from jNewcastle-street, towards the New Inn ;
</p>
<p>the entrance to it from the street is up a dark
</p>
<p>narrow passage, about thirty yards long. In the
</p>
<p>tap-room, over the embers of an expiring fire,
</p>
<p>sat a set of suspicious, ill-looking fellows, huddled
</p>
<p>close together ; whilst at a small deal table to
</p>
<p>the right sat Mr. , with a book and some
</p>
<p>papers and printed bills before him ; from the
</p>
<p>obscurity of the place, having no light but what

<p>or from that in the bar, a stranger coming in

<p>In a very large room up stairs, and which is oc-

<p>hundred ill-looking persons have assembled of an

<p>forms all round and across the room, and had
</p>
<p>hardly ever more than two or three candles to
</p>
<p>illuminate it. Here their processions, ^c, were
</p>
<p>arranged; their flags, ^c, kept; whilst the more
</p>
<p>private business was carried on below in the
</p>
<p>parlour.
</p>
<p>We now resume our narrative of the proceed-
</p>
<p>ings previous to the final commitment of the pri-
</p>
<p>soners for trial.
</p>
<p>On Thursday, March 2d, the Lords of the
</p>
<p>Council met by appointment at the Secretary of
</p>
<p>State's office for the Home Department, at twelve
</p>
<p>o'clock in the forenoon, to deliberate on the
</p>
<p>charges against the prisoners, and to determine
</p>
<p>on the best and most proper mode of proceeding
</p>
<p>against them without interrogating the prisoners
</p>
<p>or examining any witnesses. The meeting was
</p>
<p>attended by the Cabinet Ministers, the Marquis
</p>
<p>Camden, Viscount Palmerston, Mr. C. P. Yorke,
</p>
<p>the chief Baron of the Court of Exchequer in
</p>
<p>Scotland, the Hon. R. Ryder, Sir John Nicholl,
</p>
<p>Mr. R. Peel, Mr. W. Huskisson, the Master of
</p>
<p>the Rolls, and Mr. S. Bourne. There were also
</p>
<p>present the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral, and Mr, Baker, the magistrate belonging
</p>
<p>to the police-office in Marlborough-street, who
</p>
<p>signed the warrant for entering the premises in
</p>
<p>Cato-street, and for the apprehension of the gang.
</p>
<p>Their lordships continued in deliberation till near

<p>half-past two o'clock.
</p>
<p>In consequence of some mistake in the trans-
</p>
<p>mission of an order, a number of the prisoners
</p>
<p>were brought up from Coldbath-ftelds prison, to
</p>
<p>the Secre-tary of State's office^ but as their lord-

</p>
<p>ships had determined not to enter into any exami-
</p>
<p>nation of the prisoners themselves on this day,
</p>
<p>they were sent back under an escort, a few minutes
</p>
<p>after their arrival.
</p>
<p>The next day another meeting of the lords of
</p>
<p>the council took place, which was attended by the
</p>
<p>same persons as that on the previous day, with
</p>
<p>the addition of Mr. Sheriff Rothwell, Sir William
</p>
<p>Curtis, and other public characters.
</p>
<p>Soon after eleven o'clock in the morning. Laven-
</p>
<p>der, Salmon, and other officers, arrived in three
</p>
<p>coaches at Coldbath-fields prison, with orders from
</p>
<p>the Secretary of State, to bring the conspirators
</p>
<p>to Whitehall, for examination before the Privy
</p>
<p>Council. Mr. Adkins, the governor of the prison,
</p>
<p>immediately delivered over the following prisoners
</p>
<p>into the care of the officers, viz., Thistlewood,
</p>
<p>Monument, Wilson, Davidson, Tidd, Gilchrist,
</p>
<p>Ings, Bradburn, Shaw, Cooper, and Brunt. They
</p>
<p>were immediately conveyed in the coaches pro-
</p>
<p>vided for their reception to Whitehall. The pri-
</p>
<p>soners were all handcuffed to each other.
</p>
<p>About the time that this detachment reached
</p>
<p>Whitehall, Mr. Nodder, the Keeper of Tothill-
</p>
<p>fields prison, arrived at the same place in a coach,
</p>
<p>with Preston, Simmonds, Harrison, Hall, and
</p>
<p>Firth, the keeper of the loft in Cato-street.
</p>
<p>The whole of the prisoners, on their arrival at
</p>
<p>Whitehall, were placed in the first apartment.
</p>
<p>Those from the House of Correction were placed
</p>
<p>in a line, handcuffed together, on the bench im-
</p>
<p>mediately facing the entrance, and the Tolbiil-
</p>
<p>fields' prisoners were seated on a bench at the
</p>
<p>right-hand side of the room.

</p>
<p>The appearance of the whole was wretched in
</p>
<p>the extreme, and one or two of them seemed
</p>
<p>mere boys. Thistlewood appeared quite downcast,
</p>
<p>his features every day undergoing an alteration
</p>
<p>for the worse ; his complexion had become quite
</p>
<p>jaundiced, and his general appearance nerveless
</p>
<p>rXAMJN'ATIOX OF THF, CONSPIRATORS, 59
</p>
<p>and emaciated ; he wore the old brown surtout in
</p>
<p>which he had been seen of late in the streets, and
</p>
<p>kept his eyes occasionally gazins: with indifference
</p>
<p>upon the strangers who thronged the room, but
</p>
<p>mostly fixed on the ground. Davidson, the man
</p>
<p>of colour, seemed perfectly at his ease, and talked
</p>
<p>cheerfully to the prisoner who sat next him.
</p>
<p>Preston was not only quite composed, but enjoy-
</p>
<p>ing a constant smile of self-complacency at the
</p>
<p>inquisitiveness with which strangers as they
</p>
<p>passed asked *' Which is Preston ?" " Which is
</p>
<p>Thistlewood ?" Preston seemed in his usual good
</p>
<p>spirits, and had not a little of the appearance of
</p>
<p>having exhilarated them in the course of the
</p>
<p>morning by a jolly draught. While the prisoners
</p>
<p>were in this room, a considerable number of gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen were permitted to pass through the room,
</p>
<p>but none to converse with them. The police-of-
</p>
<p>ficers were stationed at the end of each seat.
</p>
<p>The Council being assembled, they were exa-
</p>
<p>mined singly before their lordships.
</p>
<p>Arthur TiiisTr.KwooD was the first who was
</p>
<p>called in. The officers immediately unlocked the
</p>
<p>liandcuff of the prisoner, and conducted him to
</p>
<p>the Council-chamber. He went up stairs with
</p>
<p>great alacrity, and being introduced, he was
</p>
<p>placed at the end of the table, with an officer on
</p>
<p>each side of him. The Lord Chancellor presided,
</p>
<p>and informed the prisoner that he was about to
</p>
<p>be committed upon the double charge of high trea-
</p>
<p>son and murder. He made no reply : but looked
</p>
<p>round at the assembled ministers with a malignant
</p>
<p>scowl. This was all thai passed, and he was
</p>
<p>immediately re-conducted to his companions : he

</p>
<p>smiled as he came back, and returned to his for-
</p>
<p>mer seat. In a short time, as if in contempt of
</p>
<p>the authority by which he was coerced, he put on
</p>
<p>his hat, and assuming a look of defiance, re-
</p>
<p>mained in that state for the remainder of the day.
</p>
<p>All the other prisoners were subsequently taken
</p>
<p>I2
</p>
<p>60 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>up in the same manner. Monument and Sim-
</p>
<p>monds were the last, and these did not return for
</p>
<p>nearly half an hour. It appears that they, at this
</p>
<p>time, endeavoured to make their peace by a dis-
</p>
<p>closure of what they knew.
</p>
<p>The soldiers engaged in the affair were then
</p>
<p>called in, and desired to look at the men whom
</p>
<p>they thought they could recognise. Sergeant
</p>
<p>Legge and nine privates were present. They
</p>
<p>soon came forth, and said they had no doubt as
</p>
<p>to the identity of the men they had assisted in
</p>
<p>securing. All the arms and ammunition taken from
</p>
<p>the prisoners, and in Cato-street, were deposited
</p>
<p>in an adjoining room under a guard.
</p>
<p>When Ings returned from the Council-cham-
</p>
<p>ber, he resumed his seat with great suUemiess ;
</p>
<p>and as soon as the officers had replaced his hand-
</p>
<p>cuffs, he and Thistlewood entered into conversa-
</p>
<p>tion with great eagerness. Thistlewood spoke
</p>
<p>almost in a whisper ; but Ings was more loud ;
</p>
<p>and, at the close of their conference, he ejaculated,
</p>
<p>as if talking to himself, but loud enough to be
</p>
<p>heard by all in the room  " It is want of food
</p>
<p>which has brought us here. Death  death would
</p>
<p>be a pleasure to me  I would sooner be hanged
</p>
<p>this instant, than turned into the street there ; for
</p>
<p>I should not know where to get a bit of bread for
</p>
<p>my family ; and if I had fifty necks, I'd rather
</p>
<p>have them all broken, one after the other, than see
</p>
<p>my children starve !"
</p>
<p>Preston continued very talkative and lofty. He
</p>
<p>seemed bursting with impatience to go before the
</p>
<p>Council ; raising himself from his chair every time
</p>
<p>the door opened, in hope of being the next called ;

</p>
<p>then sinking back into his seat with vexation and
</p>
<p>disappointment, and exclaiming, ** Oh ! how I
</p>
<p>long to go up ! My gmus is so great just now, I
</p>
<p>don't think there is any man alive has so great a
</p>
<p>genus as mine is at this moment." Then he would
</p>
<p>j)oreupon the ground for a minute or two in deep
</p>
<p>CONDUCT OF THE CONSIMUATORS. 61
</p>
<p>cogitation ; and at length break out into the follow-
</p>
<p>ing soliloquy :  " If it is the will of the Author
</p>
<p>of the World that T should perish in the cause of
</p>
<p>freedom  his will, and not mine, be done ! It
</p>
<p>would be quite a triumph to me ! Quite a triumph
</p>
<p>tome!"  at the same time throwing his arms
</p>
<p>about in a manner which savoured strongly of in-
</p>
<p>sanity. It was not, however, his fate to be called
</p>
<p>before the council at all at this time ; though, when
</p>
<p>Thistlewood and some others expressed regret
</p>
<p>that they had not applied to have their families
</p>
<p>admitted to see them  he desired them very pomp-
</p>
<p>ously to make themselves quite easy upon that
</p>
<p>head, for he would take care to mention it in his
</p>
<p>speech to their Lordships.
</p>
<p>Immediately after the prisoners had all been
</p>
<p>called in, an express was sent off to Captain J. H.
</p>
<p>Elrington, fort-major of the Tower of London,
</p>
<p>directing him to prepare for tlie immediate recep-
</p>
<p>tion of ten state prisoners.
</p>
<p>The whole of the examinations having been
</p>
<p>brought to a conclusion, the council })roceeded to
</p>
<p>deliberate upon the course which was to be
</p>
<p>adopted with respect to each individual case.
</p>
<p>They remained thus engaged for nearly two hours.
</p>
<p>During this interval the crowd in front of the
</p>
<p>office greatly increased, and the most anxious
</p>
<p>entreaties were made to be permitted to see the
</p>
<p>conspirators. These were in most cases ineffec-
</p>
<p>tual. Only a few noblemen were permitted to
</p>
<p>enter, including lord Westmoreland, lord Stair,
</p>
<p>and some others.
</p>
<p>The prisoners being themselves pretty well ap-
</p>
<p>prized of the charges which were to be preferred

</p>
<p>against them, became less equivocal in their
</p>
<p>behaviour. Wilson, Davidson, and Tidd, who
</p>
<p>were linked together, were n)ost daring. They
</p>
<p>laughed in derision at the persons who came to
</p>
<p>view them, and seemed to be little atfccted by
</p>
<p>the situation in which they were placed. Brunt,

</p>
<p>in imitation of his captain, put on his hat, and
</p>
<p>thus assumed the character which has been
</p>
<p>assigned him, of being second in command. At
</p>
<p>half past four Mr. Day, the clerk of the papers,
</p>
<p>was sent for by Mr. Hobhouse, the under secre-
</p>
<p>tary of state, who communicated to him the
</p>
<p>orders of the council.
</p>
<p>On Mr. Day's return, he stated to Sir Nathaniel
</p>
<p>Conant and Mr. Baker, who were remaining in
</p>
<p>his office, that eight of the prisoners were to be
</p>
<p>forthwith committed to the Tower. He then
</p>
<p>produced the list, and called over the names of
</p>
<p>the persons to whom he alluded. These were :
</p>
<p>Thistlewood,
</p>
<p>Monument,
</p>
<p>Brunt,
</p>
<p>Ings,
</p>
<p>Wilson,
</p>
<p>Harrison,
</p>
<p>Davidson,
</p>
<p>Tidd.
</p>
<p>The men came forth as they were called, and
</p>
<p>were handcuffed two and two. A short time now
</p>
<p>elapsed while the warrant to the constable of the
</p>
<p>Tower was preparing, and until messengers were
</p>
<p>despatched to obtain carriages, and require the
</p>
<p>presence of an escort of the Life Guards. This
</p>
<p>period was occupied by the prisoners in a sort of
</p>
<p>confused conversation. Harrison and Thistlewood
</p>
<p>at once threw off all reserve, and shook hands.
</p>
<p>The others began to speak freely. Davidson said
</p>
<p>he should like about a pound of beef-steak and a
</p>
<p>pot of porter, and his companions agreed that it
</p>
<p>would be no bad finish to their day's amuse-

<p>ments. Thistlewood said aloud, " I hear the
</p>
<p>Spaniards are getting on famously !'' Wilson
</p>
<p>answered, ** Are they  a cursed good job !"
</p>
<p>Aye," repHed Thistlewood, "They'll all have
</p>
<p>it in their turn ; they may scrag a few of us, but
</p>
<p>there is more going on than they are aware of."
</p>
<p>Harrison laughed, and exclaimed, *' Aye, time
</p>
<p>will show all things."'
</p>
<p>A bustle outside now announced the approncli
</p>
<p>f>( the Horse Guards, who drew up in a double
</p>
<p>COMMirMKNT OT THE CONSPIRATOHS. G3
</p>
<p>column iu front of the oflice, under the command
</p>
<p>of Captain Mayne. A hackney coach then drove
</p>
<p>up to the door, into which Thistlewood and
</p>
<p>Brunt were put, accompanied by Mr. Ruff, one
</p>
<p>of the king's messengers, to whom the warrant
</p>
<p>was dehvered, and by two police-officers. The
</p>
<p>coach then drew off to a short distance, preceded
</p>
<p>and followed by four of the Life Guards. A se-
</p>
<p>cond carriage then came up, into which Davidson
</p>
<p>and Ings were put ; they were likewise guarded
</p>
<p>by two officers. Ings, as he mounted the coach,
</p>
<p>exclaimed, "Hurra, boys!" in expectation, no
</p>
<p>doubt, of having a cheer from the crowd that
</p>
<p>was assembled. In this, however, he was dis-
</p>
<p>appointed ; not a word escaped from the lips of
</p>
<p>the by-standers at all in unison with the prin-
</p>
<p>ciples of the conspirators  on the contrary, they
</p>
<p>seemed to be viewed with feelings of strong
</p>
<p>disgust.
</p>
<p>Wilson and Tidd were placed in the third
</p>
<p>hackney coach : they went out laughing ; but,
</p>
<p>previous to their departure, they turned round,
</p>
<p>and, in common with all those who had been
</p>
<p>confined in Cold Bath Fields prison, begged to re-
</p>
<p>turn their grateful thanks to Mr. Adkins, the go-
</p>
<p>vernor, and to his assistants, for the humane and
</p>
<p>kind treatment which they had received while
</p>
<p>under their care : they also were guarded by two
</p>
<p>folice-officers. The last who went out were
</p>
<p>larrison and Monument. The latter, whose di-
</p>
<p>minutive size made him appear somewhat lu-
</p>
<p>dicrous when placed beside his gis^antic com-
</p>
<p>panion, was greatly depressed. Tliese men were
</p>
<p>in like manner guarded by two of the Bow-street

<p>patrol. The whole four carriages being now in
</p>
<p>readiness, and a constable having mounted each
</p>
<p>box, the cavalcade set off, completely surrounded
</p>
<p>by the Horse Guards.
</p>
<p>They j^rocceded over Westminster-brid^-e, and
</p>
<p>from thence bv the ^^'e?l^lins;eL"-l"oad, through
</p>
<p>64 CAT0-8T11EET CONSPIRACT.
</p>
<p>the Borough, and over Lonaon-bridge, up Fish-
</p>
<p>street-hill, down Fenchurch-street, the Minories,
</p>
<p>across Trinity- square to the Tower gate ; and
</p>
<p>although followed all the way by an immense
</p>
<p>throng, not one expression of commiseration
</p>
<p>was heard to escape.
</p>
<p>Ings's conduct was most daring : he continued to
</p>
<p>exclaim against His Majesty's Ministers with the
</p>
<p>most undisguised abuse, using language of the
</p>
<p>most revolting nature. He either knew, or af-
</p>
<p>fected to know, many persons in the crowd, to
</p>
<p>whom he nodded, and some of whom gave him a
</p>
<p>significant shake of the head in return.
</p>
<p>Thistlewood made no observation : he seemed
</p>
<p>to be looking anxiously from the coach window,
</p>
<p>as if to see if there were any persons passing
</p>
<p>whom he could recognise.
</p>
<p>Brunt looked extremely gloomy, but did not
</p>
<p>say any thing.
</p>
<p>Davidson did not seem at all affected by his
</p>
<p>situation, and continued in good humour.
</p>
<p>Wilson and Tidd laughed, and looked out of
</p>
<p>the coach windows with apparent indifference ;
</p>
<p>and little Monument seemed to have sunk into a
</p>
<p>state of despair : he said he supposed he was not
</p>
<p>long for this world.
</p>
<p>On reaching the upper gate of the Tower,
</p>
<p>leading to the armoury, it was found shut; but, on
</p>
<p>a regular summons being made, it was opened
</p>
<p>without hesitation, and the prisoners and their
</p>
<p>guards admitted. Notice had been sent off to
</p>
<p>the Tower, in the early part of the day, to pre-
</p>
<p>pare rooms for the prisoners, but still it was with
</p>
<p>some difficulty that secure apartments could be

</p>
<p>got in readiness ; at last the necessary accommo-
</p>
<p>dations were obtained, and the prisoners were
</p>
<p>left under the care of the yeomen of the guard.
</p>
<p>The warrant upon which they were received
</p>
<p>by the constable of the Tower, was to the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing effect : 
</p>
<p>ARRIVAr. AT THE TOWEP.. 6-5
</p>
<p>" Y'ou are hereby required to receive into
</p>
<p>your custody, Arthur Thistlewood [then followed
</p>
<p>the names of the other prisoners] who stand
</p>
<p>charged with high treason, and them safely to
</p>
<p>keep till discharged by due course of law, for
</p>
<p>which llii'^ shall be your sufficient authority." 
</p>
<p>Then followed the names of the privy-council,
</p>
<p>commencing with the Lord Chancellor, Earl West-
</p>
<p>moreland, C^'C.
</p>
<p>This warrant was written on a sheet of foolscap
</p>
<p>paper, with a black border, and bore the official
</p>
<p>seal. It was accompanied by a private note to
</p>
<p>the constable, containing instructions as to the
</p>
<p>manner in which the prisoners were to be treated.
</p>
<p>They were accordingly received by Captain
</p>
<p>Elrington, the major of the Tower, who, after
</p>
<p>some difficulty, from the shortness of the notice
</p>
<p>which he had received, succeeded in finding them
</p>
<p>secure apartments.
</p>
<p>Each prisoner was })laced in a separate apart-
</p>
<p>ment ; two warders armed in the usual way, with
</p>
<p>cutlasses and halberds, were placed in each
</p>
<p>room ; and at each door was stationed a sentinel
</p>
<p>armed, to whose care was intrusted the key of
</p>
<p>the room, with strict orders not to permit more
</p>
<p>than one warder to be absent at a time, and that
</p>
<p>only for occasional purposes.
</p>
<p>Thistlewood was placed in the prison known
</p>
<p>by the name of the Bloody Tower.
</p>
<p>Davidson was in the prison ever the water-
</p>
<p>works.

<p>Brunt and Harrison occupied separate apart-
</p>
<p>ments in the prison over the Stone-kitchen.
</p>
<p>Tidd was secured in the Seven-gun Battery
</p>
<p>prison, and Wilson in the prison over the parade.
</p>
<p>The prisoners were permitted to have, by the

</p>
<p>their awful situation, as compared with their con-
</p>
<p>finement in Coldbath-fields, a change for the
</p>
<p>better.
</p>
<p>The number of warders sufficient to do the
</p>
<p>ordinary duty of the Tower is ten ; but, as soon
</p>
<p>as the command for preparing the prisons reached
</p>
<p>the proper quarter, directions were given to in-
</p>
<p>crease the number of warders to sixty.
</p>
<p>The iron gate at the east end of the Tower was
</p>
<p>closed on the arrival of the prisoners as usual
</p>
<p>upon such occasions.
</p>
<p>Immediately after the departure of the delin-
</p>
<p>quents charged with the crime of high treason,
</p>
<p>from the Secretary of State's office, Mr. Adkins,
</p>
<p>the Keeper of the House of Correction, in Cold-
</p>
<p>bath-fields, was informed that six of the remain-
</p>
<p>ing prisoners were to be consigned to his custody,
</p>
<p>namely  Bradburn, Strange, Firth, Gillchrist,
</p>
<p>Hall, and Cooper. These men were then brought
</p>
<p>out, and escorted to Coldbath-fields prison, un-
</p>
<p>der circumstances precisely similar to those which
</p>
<p>had attended those who had gone to the Tower.
</p>
<p>They were accompanied by Mr. Silvester, a King's
</p>
<p>Messenger, to whom the warrant for their com-
</p>
<p>mitment, similar to the one addressed to the
</p>
<p>Constable of the Tower, was intrusted, and se-
</p>
<p>veral officers of the police, and by an escort of
</p>
<p>the Life-Guards.
</p>
<p>Mr. Adkins, the Governor of the House of Cor-
</p>

<p>of the wilful murder of Smithers ? He answered
</p>
<p>in the negative. No such warrant had been trans-
</p>
<p>mitted to him by Mr. Stirling. A messenger was
</p>
<p>then despatched to the coroner, who had omitted
</p>
<p>to make out the warrant, and he waited wdiile it

<p>there in a hacknev-eoach ; and thus ended the

<p>final examination of the conspirators by the Privy-

<p>Council.
</p>
<p>In addition to the gang taken at Calo-street,
</p>
<p>and the subsequent arrests which we have al-
</p>
<p>ready recorded, a young man, named Robert
</p>
<p>George, was apprehended, who was with good
</p>
<p>reason, suspected of being one of that gang, and
</p>
<p>whose discovery and appr-ehension arose out of
</p>
<p>the following extraordinary circumstances :
</p>
<p>At the time the coroner's inquest was sitting on
</p>
<p>the body of the murdered Smithers, Perry, the
</p>
<p>conductor of the patrol, who was then in attend-
</p>
<p>ance, was called out by two soldiers, who in-
</p>
<p>formed him, that on that day they had been
</p>
<p>informed by a boy, that he had discovered a de-
</p>
<p>pository of fire-arms and deadly weapons in an
</p>
<p>extraordinary way, by his having been at play in
</p>
<p>Chapel-street, Paddington, and losing a marble
</p>
<p>behind some building in that street. He v/ent
</p>
<p>behind the house of Mr. George, a haberdasher
</p>
<p>and tailor, in search of the marble, and seeing in
</p>
<p>a closet some fire-arms, a sword, 4*c., he men-
</p>
<p>tioned it to the soldiers.
</p>
<p>Upon this intimation Perry hastened to the
</p>
<p>spot as soon as possible, and found a narrow pas-
</p>
<p>sas^f^e leading to the back oi Mv. Cieorgc's pre-
</p>
<p>mises, and also a closet fastened by a staple,
</p>
<p>situate under a staircase, which answered the

</p>
<p>Mrs. George informed him that she had fastened
</p>
<p>it in consequence of the wind blowing it cipen.
</p>
<p>He desired her to produce the instrument with
</p>
<p>which she had fastened the staple, which, on
</p>
<p>being produced, resembled a hammer, and with
</p>
<p>which she also unfastened it.
</p>
<p>On the door being opened. Perry discovered
</p>
<p>a musket, a bayonet, a pistol, sword, powder,
</p>
<p>and balls. He then inquired if those articles be-
</p>
<p>longed to them, and the mother denied that they
</p>
<p>did. The daughter, who was present during the
</p>
<p>investigation, wrung her hands, and appeared
</p>
<p>greatly distressed. Perry then proceeded into
</p>
<p>the house, and found Mr. George employed in
</p>
<p>his business of a tailor, who also denied any
</p>
<p>knowledge of the fire-arms and deadly weapons,
</p>
<p>and admitted that his son occupied a house on
</p>
<p>the opposite side of the street, and might have
</p>
<p>deposited the fire-arms, ^c, in that place.
</p>
<p>On inquiry it was ascertained, that the son had
</p>
<p>absconded since the night of the meeting in
</p>
<p>Cato-street. Perry desired that Mr. George would
</p>
<p>attend at the office, and he himself accompanied
</p>
<p>Mrs. George and her daughter. On their arrival
</p>
<p>at the office, they underwent private examina-
</p>
<p>tions before Mr. Birnie, but nothing appeared
</p>
<p>which could criminate any of them ; but strong
</p>
<p>suspicions existed that their son, Robert George,
</p>
<p>was present at the Cato-street meeting, at the
</p>
<p>time Thistlewood murdered Smithers.
</p>
<p>From that time the officers had used every
</p>
<p>vigilance in endeavouring to trace him out.

<p>finding him. They nevertheless had discovered

<p>that his anxiety to leave this country was so

<p>before been a seafaring man, he had succeeded
</p>
<p>in engaging himself as a servant on board an
</p>
<p>Indiaman; and their exertions were so great,
</p>
<p>that they gained intelligence, on which they
</p>
<p>could rely, that the last place he would be at,
</p>
<p>})revious to leaving London, would be the Dundee
</p>
<p>Arms, Wapping, near the Commercial Road, where
</p>
<p>they went and waited, having no doubt but he
</p>
<p>would be there to start by the boat for Gravesend
</p>
<p>on Sunday, the 5tli of March, from which latter
</p>
<p>place the Indiamen were to sail on the following
</p>
<p>day. They waited there till about seven o'clock,
</p>
<p>at which time Robert Geor<j:e entered the house.
</p>
<p>He inquired for the Gravesend boat, and was in-
</p>
<p>formed that it had sailed a few minutes previous.
</p>
<p>On receiving that information, he appeared ex-
</p>
<p>tremely agitated and disappointed : he called for
</p>
<p>some brandy and water, and seated himself.
</p>
<p>During this time Ruthven and Salmon had satis-
</p>
<p>ned themselves beyond a doubt of his identity,
</p>
<p>And having had reason to believe that he would
</p>
<p>be fully prepared with arms for a desperate resist-
</p>
<p>ance, Salmon watched an opportunity, when he
</p>
<p>instantly rushed upon him, and, presenting a pistol
</p>
<p>to his head, exclaimed. " If you offer to stir, 1
</p>
<p>will hre.'" Ruthven then handcuffed and pro-
</p>
<p>perly secured him. On searching him they,
</p>
<p>however, found that he was not prepared with
</p>
<p>any arms, and his luggage consisted only of his
</p>
<p>clothes. The officers placed him in a hackney-
</p>
<p>coach, and lodged him in Covent-garden watch-

<p>been procured for him in Earl-street, Bricklane,

<p>that neighbourhood, who denied any knowledge

<p>vered that the brother had actually procured the

<p>said lodging for him, and in his possession they
</p>
<p>found a large thick stick, at the bottom of which
</p>
<p>was a thick iron ferrule, about two inches long,
</p>
<p>which was hollow at one end, and appeared cal-
</p>
<p>culated to receive a pike or dagger, which he

<p>acknowledged to have received of his brother

<p>George, on his parting with hilll on Sunday
</p>
<p>evening, previous to his entering the Dundee

<p>Arms.
</p>
<p>On searching Robert George's lodgings in Earl-
</p>
<p>street, they did not discover any thing of a serious
</p>
<p>or dangerous nature. The prisoner underwent a
</p>
<p>private examination before Mr. Birnie, which was
</p>
<p>reported to the Secretary of State's office for the
</p>
<p>Home Department; no orders were, however,
</p>
<p>sent for his conveyance there, and therefore a
</p>
<p>commitment was made out for the prisoner,
</p>
<p>Robert George, to the House of Correction, on a

<p>charge of high treason, whither he was conveyed

<p>fatiicr was land-steward to an ancient family in
</p>
<p>that neighbourhood ; he was placed at an curly
</p>
<p>period of life with an eminent English scImxjI-
</p>
<p>master, to be educated as a iand-sur\ cyor. "^Phis

<p>ACCOrXT OF TUISTLEWOOD, 71
</p>
<p>and at the age of twenty-one became a lieutenant
</p>
<p>in a militia regiment ; soon after this, he married
</p>
<p>a young lady, of the name of Bruce, residing
</p>
<p>near Bawtry, in Yc^rksliire, who was possessed of
</p>
<p>]>roperty amounting to 300/. per annum. Thistle-
</p>
<p>wood resigned his commission in the militia, and
</p>
<p>obtained another in a marching regiment, with
</p>
<p>which he went, at the commencement of the revo-
</p>
<p>lutionary war, to the West Indies, where he soon
</p>
<p>gave up his commission in it, and afterwards })ro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to America ; there he resided for some
</p>
<p>time, when he obtained a passport for France, and
</p>
<p>arrived there shortly after the downfall of Robe-
</p>
<p>spierre. He became initiated in all the doctrines
</p>
<p>and sentiments of the French Revolutionists, and
</p>
<p>at the peace of Amiens returned to England, when
</p>
<p>he became acquainted with the disaffected in his
</p>
<p>native country ; since which his whole life, it
</p>
<p>seems, has been spent in seeking opportunities to
</p>
<p>overthrow its constitution.
</p>
<p>From the period of his release after his former
</p>
<p>indictment lor high treason, the Government had
</p>
<p>taken care to have all his actions watched, and his
</p>
<p>movements traced ; but even with all this precau-
</p>
<p>tion, it is possible that the diabolical scheme, of
</p>
<p>which he was evidently the author and chief mover,
</p>
<p>would have been carried into effect, had it not
</p>
<p>been for the remorse of the man who made the
</p>
<p>disclosure to Lord Harrowby,
</p>
<p>One night, during his confinement in Coldbath-
</p>
<p>fields prison, the following remarkable occurrence
</p>
<p>took place in the cell of Thistlewood. In the

<p>course of the evening, Mr. Adkins, the governor,

<p>sat with him a short time, and conversed w^ith him

<p>on general topics. He was very communicative
</p>
<p>on the subject of the ditierent prisons in which
</p>
<p>he had been confined. He spoke of Horsham as
</p>
<p>being extremely strict, and observed, that the

<p>rules laid down for the management of the prisan
</p>
<p>were observed to the letter, without anv reference

<p>to the rank of the party confined. He gave the
</p>
<p>preference to the Tower as a place of incarcera-
</p>
<p>tion. The usual hour for locking up having ar-
</p>
<p>rived, Ke was left to the society of his usual com-
</p>
<p>panions. He soon retired to rest. His mind
</p>
<p>seemed restless, but, after some time, he fell into
</p>
<p>a profound sleep  thus he continued awhile, when
</p>
<p>he became evidently agitated  at last he ex-
</p>
<p>claimed, with a sort of convulsive shriek, ** Ha !
</p>
<p>I've got you now ! " and then, becoming more
</p>
<p>strangely disturbed, he awoke in a sort of phrensy :
</p>
<p>for a moment he did not seem to recollect where
</p>
<p>he was ; but, on seeing his companions with their
</p>
<p>eyes fixed upon him, he affected to laugh, and
</p>
<p>said, " What strange things one thinks of in one's
</p>
<p>sleep. ^^ He remained awake for a considerable
</p>
<p>time, and, at length sunk again into an unquiet
</p>
<p>slumber.
</p>
<p>On the subject of his arrest he spoke freely be-
</p>
<p>fore his final commitment, declaring that he knew
</p>
<p>the man by whose instrumentality he was taken,
</p>
<p>and that he was with him that morning, and was
</p>
<p>the only man who knew of his retreat. He added
</p>
<p>that but for the people in the house, the patrol
</p>
<p>who arrested him in White-street, and his brother
</p>
<p>officers should have fallen. His companions said,
</p>
<p>*' Why you had no arms ; how could you have
</p>
<p>effected their destruction?" *' Ah !" he replied,
</p>
<p>" they thought they were very cunning ; but cun-
</p>
<p>ning as they were, they were not cunning enough,"
</p>
<p>This was but a vain boast ; for, at the mo-
</p>
<p>ment the officer seized him, he was evidently
</p>
<p>paralized. He shewed no disposition to resist.
</p>
<p>No arms were found in the room, with which he

<p>could defend himself, and when he was carried
</p>
<p>off to Bow-street, six officers were left behind to
</p>
<p>search every hole and corner in the house. This
</p>
<p>they did, and found nothing to warrant an opinion
</p>
<p>that he was capable of making a formidable
</p>
<p>resistance.

</p>
<p>It is, however, rather a suspicious circum-
</p>
<p>stance, that while the officers were eng'ao^ed in
</p>
<p>securing their prisoner, the landlady, Mrs. Harris,
</p>
<p>slipped out, and gave an intimation of what was
</p>
<p>occurring to her husband, who \vas a type-foun-
</p>
<p>der in the manufictory of Messrs. Cashjn. From
</p>
<p>that time he has been " out of the way." It
</p>
<p>was ascertained that he was the manufacturer of
</p>
<p>all the bullets found upon the conspirators. A
</p>
<p>warrant was issued for his apprehension.
</p>
<p>The oilicers are satisfied that the arms which
</p>
<p>Thistlewood had in Cato-street have not been
</p>
<p>found, and imagine that he deposited them with
</p>
<p>some friend. It is a matter of surprise, that in
</p>
<p>getting rid of these evidences of his guilt, ho
</p>
<p>should have kept in his possession the black belt
</p>
<p>v/hich was seen round his waist in the loft, and
</p>
<p>which, v>ith some ball cartridges, was found in
</p>
<p>his pocket in White-street.
</p>
<p>Up to tlie tunc of his last appearance bef re
</p>
<p>the Privy-Council, lie made no inquiries respucl-
</p>
<p>ing his family, but Vv-as particular in his qucn-
</p>
<p>Li(jns as to the persons who had been arrcst.'j.
</p>
<p>Among others, he mentioned the name of Palin,
</p>
<p>for whose apprehension a rev/ard of two hiindi-evl
</p>
<p>pounds had been offered, and again describing in
</p>
<p>the most minute manner the person of Brunt, witii
</p>
<p>an evident intention to avoid mentioning his name,
</p>
<p>he asked if he was arrested? Upon these heads
</p>
<p>he received no satisfactory answer.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Tliistlewood is a smart, genteel lin'.-'
</p>
<p>woman, dresses wel', and from the first seemed
</p>
<p>perfectly alive to the situation of her husband, in
</p>
<p>whose political sentiments she heartily concui's.

<p>pointed for opening the Special Commission for

<p>the trial of the Conspirators engaged in the Cato-

<p>accordingly in the court at Hicks's-Hall, at nine
</p>
<p>o'clock in the morning. The gentlemen who
</p>
<p>were summoned on the grand inquest were also
</p>
<p>in attendemce.
</p>
<p>The M'itnesses for the Crown, about thirty in

<p>a formidable appearance.
</p>
<p>At ten o'clock the Attorney and Solicitor-Gene-

<p>Lord Chiet-Justice Abbott then addressed
</p>
<p>the Grand Jury in the manner following :
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen of the Grand Inquest  We are
</p>
<p>assembled in this place, under the authority of his
</p>
<p>Majesty's Special Commission, issued for the
</p>
<p>purpose of inquiring into, hearing, and determin-
</p>
<p>ing, certain offences-; therein particularly men-
</p>
<p>tioncdc These offences are, first, all high treasons,
</p>
<p>except such as relate to the coin of the realm ;
</p>
<p>secondly, all misprisions of treason ; thirdly, the
</p>
<p>murder of one Richard Smithers, deceased, and
</p>
<p>any other crime or offence touching the death of
</p>
<p>that person ; and, fourthly, any offences com-
</p>
<p>mitted against the persons of Frederick Fitzcla-
</p>
<p>rence, George Legg, John Surman, William West-
</p>
<p>cott, John Muddock, James Basey, and other
</p>
<p>persons, or any of them, contrary to the form of
</p>
<p>an act made and passed in the forty-third yearof
</p>
<p>the reign of his late Majesty, for, among other
</p>
<p>things, the furtlier prevention of the malicious
</p>
<p>shooting, maiming, stabbing, or wounding, any
</p>
<p>person or persons ; and, gentlemen, it has bcccm'e
</p>
<p>my duty to offer to your consideration some
</p>
<p>remarks on each of these subjects, for your as-sist-
</p>
<p>ance in the discharge of the inirportant duty
</p>
<p>which will devolve upon you when the bills are
</p>
<p>laid before you.
</p>
<p>" The paiticular crime of treason to which it
</p>
<p>would be proper to call your attention is to be
</p>
<p>found, 1st, in the ancient statute 25 Edward III.,

<p>and '2dly, in a statute passed for very wise ])ur-
</p>
<p>post;s in the 36th year of the reign of his late Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty. [His Lordship here recited the cnacling
</p>
<p>clauses of the statutes to whicli he referred ; the
</p>
<p>first of which declares it to be high treason to
</p>
<p>compass and imagine the death of the King or the
</p>
<p>lOUl) ClIIJb.B'-JLSTlCE S CHARGE, 71)
</p>
<p>Queen, or to levy war against the King within his
</p>
<p>realm ; and, the second enacts, that if any person,
</p>
<p>witliin or without the realm, compass or imagine
</p>
<p>the death of the King, or his deposition, or to do
</p>
<p>him any bodily harm, such as maiming, wounding,
</p>
<p>or imprisoning hnn, in order by force to compel
</p>
<p>him to change his measures or counsels of govern-
</p>
<p>ment, any persons so oflending shall be guilty of
</p>
<p>high treason.]
</p>
<p>" You will observe, gentlemen, that in each of
</p>
<p>the description of offences that 1 have enumerated,
</p>
<p>except the levying of war, which is in the ancient
</p>
<p>statute that 1 have alluded to, the words are,
</p>
<p>" ifnagination and intention," which are words of
</p>
<p>the same meaning, and the actual perpetration of
</p>
<p>the crime is not mentioned. But it is further re-
</p>
<p>quired by an ancient statute, that the })arty ac-
</p>
<p>cused shall be provably attainted; and by a latter
</p>
<p>statute it is mentioned, that if the party shall
</p>
<p>express, utter, or declare his intention by any
</p>
<p>printing or writing, that is an overt act of such
</p>
<p>intention. The law has wisely ])iovided ibr the
</p>
<p>public safety, that in cases of llii^ kind, which
</p>
<p>involve the most extensi\e ])uIj1ic niiscliici, the
</p>
<p>intention shall be adjudged the erime; but, at the
</p>
<p>same time, for the safetv of tlie individual cha.'ued,
</p>
<p>it is required tiiat such intention shall be niani-
</p>
<p>jested by some act tending towards the accom-
</p>
<p>plishment oi' the criminal ()l)ject charged.
</p>
<p>" It may be proper to mention, that, before the
</p>
<p>passing of a late statute, it \\"as settled by several
</p>
<p>cases, and the opinions of the hrst text writers,
</p>
<p>that all attempts to de])0se the king from his royal
</p>
<p>state, to restrain his person, or to levy war against

<p>him, were high treason ; and all conspiracies, con-
</p>
<p>sultations, and agreements for those purposes,
</p>
<p>were overt acts of compassing and imagining the
</p>
<p>death of the king. lU the late statute, all these
</p>
<p>things are made sul)staiitive treasons, and thereby
</p>
<p>the law is made more clear to those who are
</p>
<p>80 CATO-ST!iF.ET COXSPIRACT.
</p>
<p>bound to obey it, and to those who may be en-
</p>
<p>gaged in the administration of it.
</p>
<p>" It may be also proper to remark, that all the
</p>
<p>pomp and circumstances of military array are not
</p>
<p>neceBsary to the first levying of war. Insurrec-
</p>
<p>tions for the purpose of accomplishing the designs
</p>
<p>I have mentioned to you by force, however ill
</p>
<p>arranged, if they are to accomplish an innovation
</p>
<p>in public affairs, in which the parties have no
</p>
<p>special or particular interest, arc an actual levying
</p>
<p>of war. Rebellion at its first commencement is
</p>
<p>rarely found in military discipline or array, al-
</p>
<p>though a little succcs may soon lead it to assume
</p>
<p>those appearances. Any act manifesting a cri-
</p>
<p>minal intention, and tending towards the accom-
</p>
<p>plishment of the criminal object, is, in the lan-
</p>
<p>guage of the law, an overt act. Overt acts may
</p>
<p>be committed openly and manifestly; but there are
</p>
<p>other overt acts, such as meetings and consulta-
</p>
<p>tions, and contrivances, agreements and promises
</p>
<p>of mutual support and assistance, and incitements
</p>
<p>to others to engage in the same scheme, are also
</p>
<p>overt acts. Assenting to the designed purpose, as-
</p>
<p>sisting in the preparation of weapons, or any other
</p>
<p>thing necessary to the general design, are all overt
</p>
<p>acts of the particular kind of treason, of the parti-
</p>
<p>cular compassing and imagination to which they
</p>
<p>may happen to apply; and in this crime of high trea-
</p>
<p>son the law acknowledges no accessaries,  all are
</p>
<p>principals. All who participate in the design and
</p>
<p>object, whether they enter iiito tliom early or late,
</p>
<p>are e({uaily guilty ; for it v*ill be found in conspi-
</p>
<p>racies of a treasonable nature, as well as all other
</p>
<p>conspiracies, that each is engaged in accomplish-

<p>may be, if arising from private ^ malice, and not
</p>
<p>intended to bring about any other object, does not
</p>
<p>constitute the crime of high treason. But if the
</p>
<p>assassination of such persons is meant as the first
</p>
<p>step of a general design to attack and destroy by
</p>
<p>force the government of the country, or to com-
</p>
<p>pel the sovereign to adopt such measures as they
</p>
<p>may think fit, then that assassination assumes a
</p>
<p>different complexion, and may be considered an
</p>
<p>overt act of one or both of those species of trea-
</p>
<p>son which I have mentioned. If, therefore, a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy to take away the lives of his Majesty's
</p>
<p>ministers should be proved, you will look to the
</p>
<p>object about to be obtained by that assassination,
</p>
<p>and also to the number and rank of the persons
</p>
<p>intended to be assassinated ; for the crime in-
</p>
<p>creases not only with the number of the conspi-
</p>
<p>rators, but with the number of the persons in-
</p>
<p>tended to be assassinated.
</p>
<p>" It is, indeed, difficult to conceive that persons
</p>
<p>could from private malice alone, and without
</p>
<p>having a public object in view, conspire together
</p>
<p>to assassinate a number of individuals of whom they
</p>
<p>could liavc no knowledge but from the public
</p>
<p>situations which they filled. But the difficulty of
</p>
<p>the supposition must not supply the place of evi-

<p>dence. We well know that all attempts to sub-
</p>
<p>vert the government of this country must, in the
</p>
<p>calm and sober eye of reason, appear wild and
</p>
<p>hopeless ; 1)ut you will consider that the mad

<p>and the benefit attending their schemes. It is
</p>
<p>natural for the vicious to think that there are others
</p>
<p>as wicked as themselves, and that they shall gain
</p>
<p>numerous adherents if they succeed in their first
</p>
<p>attempt. It is this belief that eiten leads them to
</p>
<p>a premature disclosure of their purposes to those
</p>
<p>whom they think likely to participate in their guilt,
</p>
<p>and that thus furnishes evidence of their dan-
</p>
<p>gerous designs ; but dark and deep designs are
</p>
<p>seldom developed but through those who have
</p>
<p>joined in them. The evidence of accomplices,
</p>
<p>however, is always to be received with caution,
</p>
<p>and the conviction arising from such evidence
</p>
<p>should rest on circumstances of credibility rather
</p>
<p>than on the personal characters of the witnesses
</p>
<p>themselves. If such testimony were on all occa-
</p>
<p>sions to be rejected, one of the greatest secu-
</p>
<p>rities to the honest part of society would be anni-
</p>
<p>hilated  namely, the want of mutual confidence in
</p>
<p>those engaged in wicked schemes.
</p>
<p>'' The next subject which is likely to come
</p>
<p>under your observation is misprision of treason,
</p>
<p>which consists in the concealment of treason,
</p>
<p>when it is within the knowledge of the parties by
</p>
<p>whom it might be divulged, and whose duty it
</p>
<p>would be to go before the first magistrate, and
</p>
<p>make known the evil purposes which they know
</p>
<p>to be contemplated.
</p>
<p>" The third subject to which your attention
</p>
<p>may be directed is the murder of Richard
</p>
<p>Smit-hers, and any other offence touching the
</p>
<p>death of that person, who lost his life on the occa-
</p>
<p>sion of the attempt made to arrest those persons

</p>
<p>circumstances, where, when, and under which,
</p>
<p>that attempt to arrest them was made.

<p>of officers of justice in apprehending persons
</p>
<p>charged with crimes applies only to a dweliing-

<p>the cliaracter in which they a])pear, the persons

<p>manner as if tliey had been met in the lields, or
</p>
<p>in the ojjcn street ; and if any of these oilicers

<p>be killed v>'hcn the arrest wonld have been lawful,
</p>
<p>then the ])arLy by whom tlie death wound is in-
</p>
<p>flicted becom.es guilty of the crime of murder.
</p>
<p>The arrest of persons under the authority of a
</p>
<p>warrant from the magistrates is a lawful arrest.
</p>
<p>So also is the arrest by peace-officers, without a
</p>
<p>warrant, of persons supposed or reasonably al-
</p>
<p>leged to have committed felony. So also is an
</p>
<p>arrest by j)eace-officers, without a warrant, of
</p>
<p>persons actuallv eng-aged in anv breach of the
</p>
<p>j:)eace, or of persons assembled and arming, or
</p>
<p>otherwise preparing for the immediate perpe-
</p>
<p>tration of murder ; because such an assendjly and
</p>
<p>such a perpetration are in tiiemselves criminal,
</p>
<p>and the arrest is actually necessary for the ])re-
</p>
<p>vention of the accomplishment of a still more
</p>
<p>heinous design. 1 mention this, because the case
</p>
<p>likely to be submitted to you may iall within
</p>
<p>these observations. The persons recpiired to sur-
</p>
<p>render to the officers of the peace, though they may
</p>
<p>not be authorized to arrest them, are not warranted

<p>At the conclusion of his Lordship's address,

<p>the Jury retired to their room, and proceeded to

<p>examine witnesses upon the indictments which

<p>were preferred before them. The Judges conti-

<p>nued sitting in Court for upwards of an hour,

<p>when the foreman and a few other members of the

<p>made that their Lordships should resume their

<p>seats at twelve o'clock, and that the Grand Jury

</p>
<p>a few minutes before the Jury,
</p>
<p>Robert Ada.-ms, the ex-Oxford Blue, and an
</p>
<p>accomplice of the conspirators, was next called.
</p>
<p>He was brought from the House of Correction,
</p>
<p>where he had been in confinement since the final
</p>
<p>examination of the conspirators before the Privy-
</p>
<p>Council, in the custody of Air. Adkins, the Go-
</p>
<p>vernor, and the principal turnkey. He was three
</p>
<p>hours under examination. He appeared perfectly
</p>
<p>cool and collected when he came from the Grand
</p>
<p>Jury Room. After his examination he was taken
</p>
<p>back in custody to the Cold-Bath-fields Prison.
</p>
<p>The Right Hon. Nicholas ^'AxsITTAIlT, Chan
</p>
<p>cellor of the Exchequer, was the third witness.
</p>
<p>The Right Hon. gentleman, together with Cap-
</p>
<p>TAix FiTzcLAiiEXCE, and other witnesses' of the
</p>
<p>superior order, was accommodated with a private
</p>
<p>room, wliile waiting the summons of the Grand
</p>
<p>Jiirv. He was not more than ten minutes under
</p>
<p>examination.
</p>
<p>Joslph Baker, servant to the Earl of Har-
</p>
<p>rowby, and fourteen other witnesses, were then
</p>
<p>examined in succession. Amongst them was
</p>
<p>JoHX Moxu.MEXT, ouc of thc ciglit committed
</p>
<p>to the Tower on thc charge of high treason. He
</p>
<p>was brought from the Tower in the custody of two
</p>
<p>Yeomen of the Guard, and several officers, and
</p>
<p>was kept in a private room, attended only by the
</p>
<p>Yeomen, with their swords drawn, during the day.
</p>
<p>He seemed very uneasy, and continued pacing the
</p>
<p>room about the whole time that he remained there.
</p>
<p>He n])peared pale and dejected, and by no means
</p>
<p>a willing witness. After his examination, which

<p>lasted nearly an hour, he was conducted back to
</p>
<p>the Tower in the same custody.
</p>
<p>There were several women among the''persons
</p>
<p>examined. They were of respectable appearance.
</p>
<p>Two boys were also called.

</p>
<p>and Solicitor Generals, took tlieir respective seats.
</p>
<p>At half-past two o'clock, the Grand Jury, Jiaving-

<p>Tlie bills I'or high treason against 'x'ibel Hall

<p>The Lord Chief Justice tlien expressed to the

<p>mation, without the trouble of coming into courr,
</p>
<p>that their attorneys and counsel would have ready

<p>that every facility should be given to the commu-

<p>The Solicitor-General said, that it was not in-

<p>The Court was then adjourned by direction of

<p>A material omission occurred in the bills of in-

<p>regard to Davidson, the man of colour, who, on

<p>standing sentry at the entrance to the place of

<p>overlooked, and it was not recollected, till Wed-

</p>
<p>On Monday the 3d of April, copies of the in-
</p>
<p>dictments, with lists of the jurors and of the
</p>
<p>witnesses to be produced on the trial, were de-
</p>
<p>livered to each of the prisoners in their respective
</p>
<p>places of confinement.
</p>
<p>The List of the Jurors contained, the names of
</p>
<p>227 freeholders of the county of ^Middlesex, resi-
</p>
<p>dent in the different parishes, many of them at a
</p>
<p>considerable distance from the metropolis.
</p>
<p>The Indictment contained four counts, on each
</p>
<p>of which certain overt acts were charged, manifesting
</p>
<p>and proving the acts of treason set forth. The fol-
</p>
<p>lowing is an abstract of the Indictment.
</p>

</p>
<p>to subvert and destroy the constitution and government of
</p>
<p>this realm, as by law established.
</p>

</p>
<p>and destroy the constitution and government of this realm, as
</p>
<p>by law established.
</p>
<p>Third overt act.  That they did conspire to assassinate,

</p>
<p>Tlie reason for the service of the above notice was
</p>
<p>as follows : It was supposed that the accomplices who
</p>
<p>had become king's evidence, would, in their examina-
</p>
<p>tion as witnesses, state, that such an address as that
</p>
<p>referred to in the notice was prepared and in the pus-
</p>
<p>session of some of the defendants ; and as the prose-
</p>
<p>cutors would not, according to the rules of evidence,
</p>
<p>be allowed to give verbal testimony of the contents of
</p>
<p>the address without previously giving notice to the de-
</p>
<p>fendants to produce the original, the Crown Solicitor
</p>
<p>served them all with notice.
</p>
<p>On the 13th of April, Mr. Sheriff Roth well received
</p>
<p>a summons from the office of the Secretary of State
</p>
<p>for the Home Department, requiring his presence at
</p>
<p>Whitehall, to make the necessary arrangements for
</p>
<p>the removal of the state prisoners in the Tower to
</p>
<p>Newgate. The Sheriff, accompanied by Mr. Under-
</p>
<p>Sheriff Turner, immediately proceeded to the Home-
</p>
<p>office, where they were introduced to Lord Sidmouth,
</p>
<p>The mode of conveying the prisoners having been
</p>
<p>decided upon, Lord Sidmouth delivered to Sheriff
</p>
<p>RothwcU a writ, empowering him to receive into his
</p>
<p>custody, from the Warder of the Tower of London,

<p>In consequence of the plan adopted, on the morn-
</p>
<p>o
</p>
<p>98 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY,
</p>
<p>ing of the 14th, as early as half-past six o'clock, Mr.
</p>
<p>Sheriff Rothweli, Mr. Under-Sheriff Turner, ]\Ir.
</p>
<p>Under-Sheriff PuUen, Mr. Brown (gaoler of Newgate,)
</p>
<p>Mr. Wontner, (the Chief City Marshal,) and Mr.
</p>
<p>Brown, (the Deputy Marshal,) arrived at the Tower,
</p>
<p>and were immediately introduced to the resident
</p>
<p>Governor, Major J, H. Ehington, who had been ap-
</p>
<p>prized of their coming, and had given directions to the
</p>
<p>Warders to have their prisoners in readiness. A
</p>
<p>numerous detachment of the Life Guards soon after-
</p>
<p>wards arrived at the fortress, and these were followed
</p>
<p>by a strong party of Bow-street officers, in seven car-
</p>
<p>riages, which were engaged for the occasion.
</p>
<p>At seven o'clock, every thing being in readiness,
</p>
<p>directions were given to the Warders to bring forth
</p>
<p>their prisoners. The prisoners were then conducted
</p>
<p>separately from their respective places of confinement,
</p>
<p>between two Warders, into the Court-yard, where
</p>
<p>they were delivered to the officers in waiting, by whom
</p>
<p>they were handcuffed. While the handcuffs were
</p>
<p>being placed on Thistlewood he was greatly agitated,
</p>
<p>and trembled exceedingly.
</p>
<p>Their names were called over from the writ, and
</p>
<p>Mr. Brown, the gaoler of Newgate, was thus enabled
</p>
<p>to recognize their persons. They were all perfectly
</p>
<p>silent until about to depart, when they expressed their
</p>
<p>thanks to the Warder for the humane attention wliich
</p>
<p>they had received.
</p>
<p>The whole being now assembled, they were marched,
</p>
<p>each between two Bow-street officers, to the Fosse-
</p>
<p>gate, beyond which the carriages had been drawn up.
</p>
<p>Thistlewood was placed in the first carriage, and was
</p>
<p>joined by three police officers. The remaining pri-
</p>
<p>soners were each placed in a separate carriage, and

<p>each attended by three Bow-street officers. They
</p>
<p>were accompanied by a troop of Life Guards, and pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded in a direct course to Newgate prison.
</p>
<p>The carriages were flanked on each side by Horse
</p>
<p>Guards in sinMe file. Notwithstandiuij; the early
</p>
<p>hour of the morning, and the secrecy with which the
</p>
<p>REMOVAL TO NKWGATE. 99
</p>
<p>removal was so prudently conducted, as the carriages
</p>
<p>issued from the Tower gates, an immense throng had
</p>
<p>assembled to a\ itness their departure.
</p>
<p>In the gaol of Newgate, the Marshal's men, and a
</p>
<p>large body of constables, were assembled at seven
</p>
<p>o'clock, for the purpose of j^reserving order ; and
</p>
<p>when, at twenty minutes before eight, it was announced
</p>
<p>that the prisoners were approaching, they sallied forth
</p>
<p>and formed a half-moon in front of the felons' door.
</p>
<p>In a few seconds afterwards, the Horse Guards turned
</p>
<p>the corner of the Old Bailey, and rode up to the
</p>
<p>})rison.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sheriff Rothwell, and the Under-Sheriff, drove
</p>
<p>up to the private door of ^Ir. Brown's house, and
</p>
<p>obtained admission to the gaol by that means. The
</p>
<p>])risoners alighted at the felons' door, and were received
</p>
<p>by the chief turnkey. Thistlc\AOod as he went up
</p>
<p>the steps, appeared greatly dejected ; as did Ings, Tidd,
</p>
<p>and Brunt. Davidson, Harrison, and Wilson, seem-
</p>
<p>ed to maintain their conhdencc.
</p>
<p>The prisoners were ultimately conducted to the
</p>
<p>cells which liad been previously prepared for their re-
</p>
<p>ccpti(jn ; and the whole being thus safely delivered to
</p>
<p>tiie pro{)cr authorities, the Horse Guards rode otY to
</p>
<p>their quarters.
</p>
<p>Thistlewood was placed in a small but comfortable
</p>
<p>cell by himself, having a lire and other accommoda-
</p>
<p>tions. In the day-time an oflicer was constantly pre-
</p>
<p>sent with him ; and at niglit t\^o were kept on guaid.
</p>
<p>The other six prisoners brought from the Tower
</p>
<p>were placed altogether, and had the accommodation
</p>
<p>of a large yard on the north side of the j)rison, in which
</p>
<p>they were allowed to take the air. With them also
</p>
<p>one ofiicer in the day-time, and two at nig] it, were

<p>ahvays present.
</p>
<p>At three o'clock in the afternoon the four prisoners
</p>
<p>conhned in the House of Correction, likewise arrived
</p>
<p>at Newgate, witliout any militarv escort. They were
</p>
<p>brought in two carriages, accompanied by five or six
</p>
<p>poHce-otliceri. These four prisoners were placed in a

<p>100 CATO-STIIKET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>separate cell apart from those who had been brought
</p>
<p>from the Tower.
</p>
<p>With respect to die prisoners arrived from the
</p>
<p>House of Correction, the same precautions were
</p>
<p>taken, and one guard in the day, and two at night,
</p>
<p>were appointed to be conctantly present with them.
</p>
<p>In order to prevent any disturbance of a serious na-
</p>
<p>ture taking place, a further precaution had been taken.
</p>
<p>A detachment of the London Militia arrived in the
</p>
<p>course of the afternoon at Newgate, and continued
</p>
<p>thereuntil the whole of the trials were concluded.
</p>
<p>A committee was formed among the friends and
</p>
<p>partizans of the prisoners, for the purpose of raising
</p>
<p>subscriptions to support the wives and families of the
</p>
<p>unfortuiidte men, who, it will be recollected, were all
</p>
<p>of tlie lowest and most abject class of society, during
</p>
<p>their imprisonment, and for employing a solicitor, re-
</p>
<p>taining counsel, and arranging other matters for their
</p>
<p>defence on the approaching trial.
</p>
<p>The following hand-bill, containing a forcible ap-
</p>
<p>peal to the feelings of the public, was put forth by the
</p>
<p>families of the misguided men, under the direction of
</p>
<p>the committee for the management of their defence.
</p>
<p>How far the assertions so confidently expressed in this
</p>

</p>
<p>in the public Journals, the former of which in manv in-

<p>iitmices have been interested parties, and have even been
</p>
<p>proveil to have instigated to the conniiission of crime, that
</p>
<p>they might afterwards betray the delinquents, and obtain the
</p>
<p>promised reicard; and the latter are notoriously guilty of
</p>
<p>loading their daily columns with tlie most scandalous false-
</p>
<p>hoods and misrepresentations.
</p>
<p>" 1 nder these impressions, they trust that a generous and

<p>humane Public will suspend their judgment, until the whole

<p>of this unliappy business has undergone the solenm and

<p>final adjudication of a Legal Tribunal, when the guilt or inno-
</p>
<p>cence of the respective parties may be rendered manifest to
</p>
<p>the world at large. Of tliis they are naturally the nu^ie so-
</p>
<p>licitous, because it will be recollected, that when upon a
</p>
<p>former occasion, some of the persons who now stand charged
</p>
<p>with the crime of High Treason, were accused and tried for
</p>
<p>a similar ofience, it was found, after a patient and impartial
</p>
<p>investigation, to the perfect satisfaction both of the Jury
</p>
<p>and the British Public, that the alleged Conspiracy was (as
</p>
<p>they verily believe the present will also be proved,) nothing
</p>
<p>more than the artful invention of hired Spies and secret
</p>
<p>Aiients, who endeavoured to instigate to the perpetration of
</p>
<p>crime, that they themselves might reap an ample harvest
</p>
<p>from the blood of their deluded victims, and recommend
</p>
<p>themselves to their employers.

<p>Arthur Thistlewood entered first ; he looked jxdc

<p>104 CATO-STREET COXSPIllACV.
</p>
<p>and dejected. He was dressed in a black coat and
</p>
<p>velvet collar, light-coloured waistcoat, blue trowsers,
</p>
<p>and shoes. None of the prisoners were either hand-
</p>
<p>cuffed or bolted. The other men were decently clad,
</p>
<p>according to their means, and appeared cleanly and
</p>
<p>healthful. The whole being assembled,
</p>
<p>Mr. Clarke, the deputy clerk of the arraigns, pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to call over their names from the back of the
</p>
<p>bill found for high treason, preparatory to
</p>
<p>THE ARRAIGNMENT.
</p>
<p>Arthur Tliistlewood first came forward, and was
</p>
<p>desired to hold up his hand. Having complied with
</p>
<p>this direction, he was placed at the bar. William
</p>
<p>Davidson (the man of colour), James Ings, John
</p>
<p>Thomas Brunt, and Richard Tidd, were then called,
</p>
<p>and went through the same ceremony.
</p>
<p>Upon coming to the name of Jame| Willi amWilson,
</p>
<p>Wilson, who remained with the other prisoners, did not
</p>
<p>answer. The name was twice repeated, but still he
</p>
<p>took no notice. One of the turnkeys then addressed
</p>
<p>him personally, and said, " Come forward, Wilson,"
</p>
<p>to which he replied, " That is not my name."
</p>
<p>Mr. Cu 11 WOOD now stated to the Court, that he
</p>
<p>was Counsel for some of the prisoners, and that it was
</p>
<p>intended to put in a plea of misnomer as to this man.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  That must be done when
</p>
<p>the indictment is read, and when the prisoner is called
</p>
<p>on to plead.
</p>
<p>The remaining prisoners, John Harrison, Richard
</p>
<p>Bradburn, and John Shaw Strange, James Gilchrist,
</p>
<p>and Charles Cooper, were then called, and severally
</p>
<p>came to the bar, and held up their hands.

<p>On coming to the second count,
</p>
<p>iVIr. Cunvuud submitted, that as the overt acts in
</p>
<p>this count were similar to those in the tirst count, it
</p>
<p>Mas scarcely necessary to give the officer of the court
</p>
<p>the trouble of reading, or tiie court the fatigue of listen-
</p>
<p>ing to it.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justke Abbott.  You think it may
</p>
<p>be dis{)ensed with : very well. This may the moie
</p>
<p>readily be acquiesced in, as all the prisoners ha\ e been
</p>
<p>furnished with copies of the indictment. Unless tiie
</p>
<p>prisoners themselves desire it, therefore, this count
</p>
<p>need not be read. His Lordshij) then addressed him-
</p>
<p>self to the prisoners, and asked them whether they
</p>
<p>wished any more of this count to be read ? He added,
</p>
<p>that their counsel thought it unnecessary.
</p>
<p>I}i<^s.  I do not think it is necessary.
</p>
<p>Ttie other prisoners all acquiesced in this determina-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>Tiie succeeding counts were then read, when Mr.
</p>
<p>Clarke addressed himself to Arthur Thistlewood, and
</p>
<p>asked him, whether he was guilty or not guilty of the
</p>
<p>treasons and felonies whereof he stood charged ?

<p>Thistltu'ood.  Not guilty.
</p>
<p>Mr. Clarke.  How will you be tried ?

<p>The same question, which is the usual form in ar-

<p>that that was not his name.

<p>Mr. CuRWOOD.  We mean to plead in abatement

<p>pared ?
</p>
<p>Mr. CuRwooD. Yes, my Lord.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice Abbott.  Let it be sworn.
</p>
<p>The plea was then handed to Wilson, and he was
</p>
<p>sworn, in the customary form, to answer all such
</p>
<p>questions as the Court should demand of him.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  Have you read the con-
</p>
<p>tents of that plea, and the form of affidavit subjoined;

<p>and is it true in matter and in substance?

<p>Wilson.  I have, my Lord ; I have signed it ; it is

<p>The whole of the indictments having been gone
</p>
<p>through,
</p>
<p>The Attorney -General addressed the Commis-
</p>
<p>sioners, and said, that as he understood it was the
</p>
<p>wish of the prisoners to separate their challenges, he
</p>
<p>begged that the prisoners might be apprized that
</p>
<p>Arthur Thistle\vood would be tried alone upon the
</p>
<p>indictment for high-treason on Monday morning.
</p>
<p>The LorcZ Chief Justice desired that the pi'isoners
</p>
<p>might be asked, whether it was their wish to challenge
</p>
<p>separately ?
</p>
<p>The prisoners all expressed their wish to that effect.
</p>
<p>Mr. Shelton then addressed Thistlewood, and in-
</p>
<p>formed him that he would be put upon his trial for
</p>
<p>high-treason on Monday morning, at nine o'clock.
</p>
<p>The prisoners were then all taken from the bar,
</p>
<p>with the exception of Wilson, who remained to make
</p>
<p>affidavits to the pleas which he had tendered.
</p>
<p>The Attorney Gerieral then adverted to the neces-
</p>
<p>sity of assigning Council to the prisoners under the
</p>
<p>terms of the statute.
</p>
<p>The hord Chief Justice desired that the names of
</p>
<p>the Council selected by the prisoners might be stated
</p>
<p>to the Court.
</p>
<p>Mr. llarmcr immediatCily announced, that Mr.
</p>
<p>Adolphus and Mr. Curwood were to be the Coun-
</p>
<p>sel for the first six prisoners, including x'Vrthur Thistle-

<p>The Ijord Chief Justice directed that the Council

<p>The additional pleas of ^V'ilson were then brought

</p>
<p>TRIAL OF ARTHUR TIHSTLEWOOD,
</p>
<p>First Day, April 17, 1820.
</p>
<p>The interest excited by this trial was strongly mani-
</p>
<p>fested by the assemblage of a croud in front of the
</p>
<p>Sessions-house, as early as seven o'clock. Previous
</p>
<p>to this time a numerous body of the civil force had
</p>
<p>arrived, and were stationed in such situations as to
</p>
<p>control the multitude. For the purpose of prevent-
</p>
<p>ing the interruption arising from the })assage of cai-
</p>
<p>riagcs and carts through the Old Bailey, rails were
</p>
<p>erected at the two ends, next Ludgate-hill and Fleet-
</p>
<p>lane. These were only opened to admit the carriages
</p>
<p>of persons engaged in the business of the Court.
</p>
<p>At eight o'clock the arrival of the jurymen who
</p>
<p>had been summoned created consideral)lc bustle, 'and
</p>
<p>this was greatly increased by the pressure of other
</p>
<p>persons for admission to the Court. Regulations
</p>
<p>were adopted to prevent the enD'ance of those who
</p>
<p>were not provided v.ith tickets. This \\as the more
</p>
<p>necessary, as from the limited nature of the Court
</p>
<p>but a small portion of the public could obtain accom-
</p>
<p>modation. The Jury alone, who stood in the body
</p>
<p>of the Court, were upwards of two hundred in number.
</p>
<p>Certain boxes were devoted to the rece{)tion of fe-
</p>
<p>males, several of whom were {)resent.
</p>
<p>The witnesses for the Crown were divided into two
</p>
<p>})arties. The more respectable were placed in the
</p>
<p>Grand Jury room, and those of an humbler class
</p>
<p>remained in a contiguous apartment.
</p>
<p>Monument, who remained a prisoner in the Tower,
</p>
<p>was brought from thence in the care of two Avardcrs,

<p>and Lavender and Bishop. He was placed in a room
</p>
<p>by himself, as was Adams, who was brought from
</p>
<p>the House of Correction in the custody of Crovernur

<p>Adkins.

<p>The pikes, swoicls, gun?, pistols, grenadcvs, ammu-
</p>
<p>nition, and otlier articles intended to be produced on
</p>
<p>the trial, and which the witnesses broi*<vht with them,
</p>
<p>presented a most formidable appearance.
</p>
<p>At half- past eight Thistlewood was conducted from
</p>
<p>his cell, in the care of one of the Turnkeys. He
</p>
<p>appeared greatly dejected. He was placed in the
</p>
<p>apartment usually devoted to those about to be put on
</p>
<p>their trials. The other prisoners were not brought
</p>
<p>down.
</p>
<p>As the time appointed for the sitting of the Com-
</p>
<p>missioners approached, the body of the Court became
</p>
<p>greatly crowded ; while the galleries, Avhich are pri-
</p>
<p>vate jjroperty, and to which admission could only be
</p>
<p>obtained by the payment of a guinea, were compara-
</p>
<p>tively thin. The boxes assigned to the Committee
</p>
<p>of City Lands and the Grand Jury were completely
</p>
<p>filled.
</p>
<p>At nine o'clock the Commissioners entered the Court
</p>
<p>in the same order as described on Saturday. The
</p>
<p>Court was then opened in the usual form.
</p>
<p>Mr. Shelton immediately proceeded to call over the
</p>
<p>names of llie Jurymen summoned. As tlicy answered,
</p>
<p>they were asked, whether they were freeholders in
</p>
<p>the county of Middlesex to the amount of t(>n [)ounds
</p>
<p>a-year, or of a freehold and copyhold together of that
</p>
<p>amount? In the event of their answering in the
</p>
<p>negative, they were passed over. Those who did not
</p>
<p>answer when called, were called upon their summonses
</p>
<p>" to come forth and save their fines of 100 shillings
</p>
<p>and issr.e." Several were in this predi-cament.
</p>
<p>Tlie object of this ceremony was to ascertain the
</p>
<p>number and eligibility of the Jurymen in attendance,
</p>
<p>j)re|)aratory to their being subsecjuently subject to the

<p>attention. He '.vas dressed as on Satunlav, and came
</p>
<p>forward with apparent linnness. lie had in his iiaiid
</p>
<p>a pencil and a .sheet of {)aper. He jxiid partieidar
</p>
<p>attention to the names as they were calh'tl over.
</p>
<p>Tlie Council tor the Crown in atK iKlaiiee were,
</p>
<p>the Attoi'ney-(jeneral, tlie Soh'eitur-l lenera!, Mr.
</p>
<p>Bolland, and Mr. Littledale. Tiio.>e for the pri-oners
</p>
<p>were, Mr. Cuiwood, ^Ir. Adolphir^, Mr. \\'ahord,
</p>
<p>and Mr. Ih^odcrick. Sucli was the pres.-ure occa-
</p>
<p>sioned hv the asscmblaije of the Jiirv, that thcv were
</p>
<p>constrained to ask permission to (juit the Court as
</p>
<p>their names were called over. 1 his request was com-
</p>
<p>plied with, but tiiey were desired to remain witiiin
</p>
<p>iiearing.
</p>
<p>As the })risoncr stood at the bar, and while the
</p>
<p>Court was occupied in attending to the list of the
</p>
<p>Jury beinii; called over, a man of shabby appearance
</p>
<p>contrived to get to the corner of the dock, and to
</p>
<p>f)Iace his hat on the board in front, and then, calling
</p>
<p>Thistlewood's attention, directed him to take the
</p>
<p>contents. Thistlewood immediately took from the
</p>
<p>hat live oranges, which he j)ut in his ])ocket. Mr.
</p>
<p>Brown, who was in his box, witnessed the transaction,
</p>
<p>and admonished the obtruder. He afterwards directed
</p>
<p>one of his turnkeys to take the oranges into his pos-
</p>
<p>session. Thistlewood, on neing asked, delivered up
</p>
<p>the fruit, and thev were carried out of Court to be
</p>
<p>examined.
</p>
<p>There might seem, in this conduct, on the part
</p>
<p>of Mr. Brown, something of harshness ; but when
</p>
<p>it i.> recollected that an orange might be made the
</p>
<p>vehicle of conveying to the prisoner ttie means of
</p>
<p>personal destruction, or soine otlier thing which the

<p>precautions already taken were meant to pre\'ent,

<p>it will be seen that he did no more than became the
</p>
<p>vigilant execution of his duty. The oranges, having
</p>
<p>been examinetl, ^vere returned. It was intimated to
</p>
<p>Thistlewood that he ^houUl be i)rovi(led Avith any
</p>
<p>thin^ in the way of refreshnicnt which he miiiht

<p>nication with the prisoner, save under an order from
</p>
<p>the Secretary of State, had been most positively
</p>
<p>interdicted. The act of the individual in the present
</p>
<p>instance, however well-intentioned, was in direct con-
</p>
<p>travention of this order.
</p>
<p>Subsequent to this transaction, two letters, which
</p>
<p>had come by post, were delivered to Mr. Brown.
</p>
<p>We believe they were addressed to the prisoners, and,
</p>
<p>after they had been shewn to him, ^h. Brown felt
</p>
<p>it his duty to enclose and send them to tlic Solicitor
</p>
<p>of the Treasury.
</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock the whole of the jury had been
</p>
<p>called over.
</p>
<p>Thidlewood then addressed the Court, and said,
</p>
<p>" Will your Lordship allow me a chair?"'
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  Considering the length
</p>
<p>of time which your trial is likely to last, the Court
</p>
<p>will grant you this indulgence.
</p>
<p>A chiiir was then placed at the front of the dock,
</p>
<p>and the prisoner sat down, having first thanked the
</p>
<p>Court.
</p>
<p>THE TRIAL.
</p>
<p>Mr. Shclton then announced to the prisoner, that
</p>
<p>the jury were about to be called ; and that, if ho
</p>
<p>was dis{)Osed to challePige any or either of them, lie
</p>
<p>would do so on their coming to the box to be sworn,
</p>
<p>and before they were sworn.

<p>A considerable n.umber of challenges Uien took

<p>After M'hich the Lord Chief Justice thus dehvcred

<p>hiin-elt":  " As there are several persons charged with
</p>
<p>the ollence of hi^h treason by this indictment, whosc^
</p>
<p>trials are hkelv to be taken one after tiie other, I
</p>
<p>tiiink it necessary, in the furtiierancc of justice,

<p>strictly to prohibit the })ubUcation of the proceedings
</p>
<p>of this, or any odier day, until tlie whole of the trials
</p>
<p>shall be bi-ought to a conclusion. It is highly necessary
</p>
<p>to the purposes of justice that the public ujind, or
</p>
<p>the jurymen who are hereafter to serve, should not
</p>
<p>be intiuenced by the publication of any of the pro-

<p>that all persons, therefore, A\ill attend to this admo-

<p>Mr. IShc/ton then called the attention of the prisoner,

<p>and read the indictment.

<p>Mr. Bollcuid, as junior Counsel lor the Crown,

<p>the charge which is about to be preferred against the
</p>
<p>jirisoner al the bar, confining your attention solely and
</p>
<p>exclusively to the evidence which will be adduced in
</p>
<p>support of the charge, and forming your conclusion
</p>
<p>on that evidence only. Gentlemen, the charge as I
</p>
<p>have stated to you, is one of the highest nature known
</p>
<p>to the law. Other offences, generally speaking, how-
</p>
<p>ever heinous and however enormous, may in their con-
</p>
<p>sequences, except so far as example is concerned, end
</p>
<p>with the fate of the perpetrators, or with the indivi-
</p>
<p>duals who have been injured ; but, with respect to high
</p>
<p>treason, not only in its inception, but still more so if
</p>
<p>it is unfortunately completed, it draws after it conse-
</p>
<p>quences of the most important kind, affecting, not
</p>
<p>merely individuals, but the whole community against
</p>
<p>whom it is directed.
</p>
<p>" Gendemen, I shall not trouble you in the obser-
</p>
<p>vations I have to make to you, painful as the duty now
</p>
<p>imposed upon me is, with any lengthened detail Math
</p>
<p>regard to the law as it affects the charge imputed to
</p>
<p>the prisoner ; because, if I mistake not, that law is
</p>
<p>so clear, and if I err not greatly, the facts that will
</p>
<p>be proved to you will establish the case against the
</p>
<p>prisoner in so clear and satisfactory a manner, that it
</p>
<p>would be an idle affectation in me to cite any autho-
</p>
<p>rities before you in support of the charge ; because if
</p>
<p>the overt acts, as they are called, or any of them, are
</p>
<p>proved to your satisfaction (and I have no doubt but
</p>
<p>a considerable number of them will be proved,) no
</p>
<p>man who hears me can entertain the slightest doubt
</p>
<p>that the ofi'ence charged in the indictment will be
</p>

<p>evidence ; and if the evidence I shall lay before you be
</p>
<p>sufficient to establish one of them, it will, I believe,
</p>
<p>completely establish the whole. Three of the offences
</p>
<p>charged, consist in compassing and imagining the de-
</p>
<p>position of the King from his throne ; the death of
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF TIIISTLEWOOD. 115
</p>
<p>the Kiiiiz : and a conspiracy to levy war, in order to
</p>
<p>compel liiin to chanii-e liis measures lor tlie <<;oveni-
</p>
<p>nient of the kingdom.
</p>
<p>" It is hardly necessary for me to state to you, that
</p>
<p>in })roof of tliese charges, it is not esseniial that the
</p>
<p>plans of the parties accused should aim (Urectly and
</p>
<p>immediately either at the life or the depcj.-^ition of iiis
</p>
<p>Majesty ; because, if they are aimed at that form of
</p>
<p>go\eniment which now exists  if intended to luring
</p>
<p>about a cliange in the system of rule now estu'oli>hcd,
</p>
<p>by means of war, which would naturally tend to ehect
</p>
<p>thatwhicli must ultimately result either in the removal
</p>
<p>of the King from his kingly dignity, or in compelling
</p>
<p>him to change his measures in Council, that would
</p>
<p>be high treason ; and therefore in these cases it is quite
</p>
<p>suliicient to shew that the plans framed were of a de-
</p>
<p>scription and nature aiming against the government,
</p>
<p>(which will undoubtedly be proved in this case)
</p>
<p>alth(jugh not directly and in the first instance aimed
</p>
<p>against the })ersonal safety or the personal autliority
</p>
<p>of the Crown. If, therefore, the consequences of
</p>
<p>the acts of the accused in this case, if those acts liad
</p>
<p>been perfected, must inevitably have led to these
</p>
<p>results, thev establish in point of law the treason
</p>
<p>charged; and therefore, Gentlemen, not to bewilder
</p>
<p>3'ou in the inquiry which you are about to enter upon,
</p>
<p>I think it (juite sufficient in the outset to state to you,
</p>
<p>that, in which I believe I shall be confirmed by the
</p>
<p>highest authority in the law ^vhen this case comes to
</p>
<p>be summed u{) to you, rh., that if tlie overt acts and
</p>
<p>facts charged in the indictment as evidencing the in-
</p>
<p>tention existing in the minds of the conspirators be
</p>
<p>proved to your satisfaction, they do prove the charges
</p>
<p>laid in this indictment ; and, therefore, it is unneces-

<p>sary to trouble you ^vith any further observations on
</p>
<p>the law of the case.
</p>
<p>*' Gentlemen, important as the duty is which you
</p>
<p>are called upon to discharge, and anxious as that duty
</p>
<p>certainly must be to you, mine, I say, is no less

<p>anxious ; for although in the address I ])urposc

<p>makiiis; lo yon, 1 do assure you I mean only to inform
</p>
<p>your iiiinds of the nature of the cliarge brought be-
</p>
<p>fore you, and of the evidence by which that charge
</p>
<p>^^iU be substantiated, yet my duty is most [)ainfui ;
</p>
<p>and I make this address \^ ith no view of leading your
</p>
<p>minds to any conclusion which the evidence itself does
</p>
<p>]iot warrant  with no intention of making any addi-
</p>
<p>tioii of my o^vn, for, God knows, tlie facts want no
</p>
<p>addition to accelerate the inevitable conclusion to which
</p>
<p>you must come. It is my duty to state to you, as
</p>
<p>counsel for the prosecution, the case against the unfor-
</p>
<p>tunate man at the bar, as detailed to ine in my in-
</p>
<p>sti'uctions. INIy anxiety, therefore, is, I do assure
</p>
<p>you most conscientiously, not by any thing I shall
</p>
<p>state to you to attempt to lead or direct your minds to
</p>
<p>the conclusion which you ought only to draw iTOiii the
</p>
<p>evidence, but to state to you calmly and fairly the
</p>
<p>facts which I believe will be proved, without any at-
</p>
<p>tempt at exaggeration on the one hand, or any thing
</p>
<p>but a fair and candid narrative on the other, without
</p>
<p>any colouring whatever, because no colouring can
</p>
<p>alter the real facts of the case, however high. If I
</p>
<p>should err in this, and if in any thing I state to you,
</p>
<p>you shall, when you come to make up your minds,
</p>
<p>think the statement not proved in evidence, or the
</p>
<p>observations or inferences which I may have drawn
</p>
<p>shall not be fairly borne out by the facts proved, yon
</p>
<p>A\ill dismiss them from your minds, and confine your
</p>
<p>attention to tliat alone which is proved. But if you
</p>
<p>believe the statement I shall n^.ake, if you believe tlie
</p>
<p>observations made in that statement aie iUir and natu-
</p>
<p>ral on the facts, then you will give them the x'veight

<p>(iintlcmen, having said thus much, I will, with-

<p>you, let nothing that you have known or heard of him
</p>
<p>before vou came into this court to discharge the so-
</p>
<p>lemn duty vou are bound to perform, have the least
</p>
<p>etl'eet uj)on that verdict you are to pronounce. Tlie
</p>
<p>prisoner at the bar, however, I state to vou, as it\\iU
</p>
<p>be proved in evidence, had for some time conceived
</p>
<p>the wicked and nefarious plan of overturning the go-
</p>
<p>vernment so lonn; established in this country ; and it
</p>
<p>will appear to you that several, nay, all of the persons
</p>
<p>mentioned in the indictment, were participators in the
</p>
<p>same design ; some of them, probably, coming into
</p>
<p>tliat purpose and design at a later period than others,
</p>
<p>but all of them concurring in the last criminal event
</p>
<p>vvliich led to their detection. I shall j)rove to you l)y
</p>
<p>the most satisfactory evidence, that all of them were
</p>
<p>combining in that act, which was to be the commence-
</p>
<p>ment of that revolution in the countrv, which was
</p>
<p>meditated. I would, however, call your attention to
</p>
<p>two jiersons, whose names you will frequendy hear
</p>
<p>in the course of this inquiry, I mean a person of the
</p>
<p>na!ne of James Ings, and a person of the name of
</p>
<p>John Thomas Erunt.
</p>
<p>" The prisoner at the bar resided, during the time
</p>
<p>of the transaction which I am about to relate to you,
</p>
<p>in Stanhope-street, Clare Market. The person named
</p>
<p>]jrunt, I believe, was a shoe-maker or boot-closer,
</p>
<p>residing at a place which m ill be frecjucndv mentioned
</p>
<p>in the course of the evidence, Fox-court, (rray's Inn-
</p>
<p>lane ; lie inhabited two rooms in a hou'ie in that court,

<p>I believe the second tloor, and in one of which his
</p>
<p>trade was carried on, and in die other his family,
</p>
<p>consisting of himself, his v.ife, an apprentice of the
</p>
<p>name of l[ale=, and his son, lived.

</p>
<p>you, that long prior to that period the prisoner at the
</p>
<p>bar, the two i)ersons I have mentioned, and several
</p>
<p>of the others, whose names arc included in this indict-
</p>
<p>ment, had consulted and devised plans for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of overturning the Government. They had
</p>
<p>frequent meetings at a public-house, called the
</p>
<p>"White Hart, in Brooks' Market, in a room \\hich they
</p>
<p>had obtained for tlic purpose of these meetings, be-
</p>
<p>hind that pubhc-housc.
</p>
<p>"About the latter end of January, or at the com-
</p>
<p>mencement of the month of February, they thought
</p>
<p>it prudent to remove their meetings from this place,
</p>
<p>and that it would be better that they should be car-
</p>
<p>ried on, if possible, in a room in the house where
</p>
<p>Brunt lived in Fox-court ; and to avoid suspicion,
</p>
<p>they therefore had recourse to this contrivance, that
</p>
<p>another room in that house, and upon the same floor
</p>
<p>on which Brunt resided, should be taken by the
</p>
<p>prisoner Ings, \\ ho is, 1 believe, by trade a butcher.
</p>
<p>Brunt and Iniis on that occasion hired that room, for
</p>
<p>the avowed purpose of a lodging for Ings, but for the
</p>
<p>secret and real object of having their meetings there,
</p>
<p>where they might devise their plans, and prepare the
</p>
<p>means for carrying the object of their cons[)iracy into
</p>
<p>execution ; that being a place of more security and
</p>
<p>privacy than the one at which they had previously held
</p>
<p>their assemblies.
</p>
<p>"At the close of the month of January, or the
</p>
<p>beginning of the njonth of February, you will learn,
</p>
<p>that having previously prepared means for eirccting
</p>
<p>their plans, their meetings at Brunt's i"Oom became
</p>
<p>more frequent and regular. They had determined

<p>])urj)ose which then entered into their minds, and the
</p>
<p>May in which they intended to consununate the ne-
</p>
<p>farious (Operations they had in view.  It was thouglit
</p>
<p>by Engli:?hnien, that the assassination of several, if
</p>
<p>not all, of his ]\hije.>ty's ministers would be a j)ro-

</p>
<p>they intended ; and you will lind tlmt tliey meditated
</p>
<p>and consulted on the means i)y wliieli tliat horrible
</p>
<p>purpose was to be C(jnij)leted. Tliey entertained
</p>
<p>hopes that they might be enabled, at some meeting of
</p>
<p>his Majesty's ministers, to ellbct all at once the double
</p>
<p>])urpose they had conceived. Having done that, they
</p>
<p>intended at the same moment, or about the same
</p>
<p>time, to set tire to various parts of this metro[)olis 
</p>
<p>to endeavour to obtain ])Ossession of the cannon which
</p>
<p>were at the Aitillery Ci round, and at the Light Horse
</p>
<p>Volunteers' Stables in Gray's Inn-lane  to create as
</p>
<p>much contusion and dismay as they could by these
</p>
<p>various operations, and then to establish, wliat, in
</p>
<p>their vain expectations, they had imagined themselves
</p>
<p>capable of etfecting  a provisional government, the
</p>
<p>seat of which was to be at the Mansion-house. Tliey
</p>
<p>liad frequent deUberations on this })lan,
</p>
<p>" You will recollect that his late Most Excellent
</p>
<p>Majesty died on the 29th of January. At this time
</p>
<p>their deliberations were TOin^ on with the meatest
</p>
<p>activity. During tlie latter end of that month and
</p>
<p>the beginning of February, it was thought that the
</p>
<p>meeting of his Majesty's ministers at the King's
</p>
<p>funeral Mould be a pro})er occasion for carrying their
</p>
<p>])lans into eliect. They had intimation that u})on
</p>
<p>that occasion, the greater part of the troops centred
</p>
<p>in the metropolis would be removed to Windsor, to
</p>
<p>witness the solemnity ; and they imagined that Avould
</p>
<p>be a fit and pro[)er })eriod to conunence their opera-
</p>
<p>tions ; but, however, they found that their schemes
</p>
<p>embraced more objects than at that period ihey had
</p>
<p>the means of etfecting, and upon that night they did
</p>
<p>not attem})t the pur})0ses they had in view. Eut,

<p>many of these men became impatient at the delay

<p>which from unavoidable circumstances, inter[)osed

<p>between the ])resent day and that on which they ho\)vd

<p>to accomplish their purposes ; and you will lind that

<p>an opj)ortunlty offered at whieh they could effect the

<p>horrible purpose I have mentioned  the assassination
</p>
<p>of all his ]Majesty's ministers assembled at one and

<p>the same house.
</p>

<p>Tebruary, that on the Wednesday following the op-
</p>
<p>portunity would occur when they would be able to
</p>
<p>etfect their purpose, by linding that his Majesty's
</p>
<p>ministers would be assembled at the same house.
</p>
<p>Upon hearing that such an asseml)lage was to take
</p>
<p>place, tliey determined, at a meeting held for that
</p>
<p>purpose, that at all events, on the following Wethies-
</p>
<p>day some blow sliould be struck, and that tlie revolu-
</p>
<p>tion they had in contemplation sliould actually take

<p>])lacc.
</p>
<p>'' Having thus determined, they appointed a meet-
</p>
<p>ing on the following day, Saturday, at Brunt's house,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of fornfmg a committee, upon whom
</p>
<p>should devolve the plan which was to be effected on
</p>
<p>the ensuing Vrednesday, at that meeting ; and indeed
</p>
<p>at all the meetings, \ou v.ill find the prisoner foremost
</p>
<p>in every thing. He was to be their leader, and he
</p>
<p>Avas to be one of the men on whom tliey placed the
</p>
<p>greatest rcliapx'e. Yon will find that at tliis meeting
</p>
<p>lie is the person who addressed them, and ])repared

</p>
<p>^' Tliis plan, formed at that meeting, was seeonded
</p>
<p>by Brunt, whose name I have ahx'ady mentioned ; and
</p>
<p>there too it was agreed as I have ah'eady stated, that
</p>
<p>on the following day, Saturday, a meeting should take
</p>
<p>place at Brunt's room, in order to appoint a com-
</p>
<p>nu'ttee, upon uhom should devolve t'iie linal arrange-

<p>ment of the plan which was to be executed on the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing Wednesday.

<p>" On the Sundav the meetin"; accordiniilv took
</p>
<p>place, attended by the prisoner, by Ings, by Harrison,
</p>
<p>by Mllson, and by other persons, whose names are
</p>
<p>mentioned in this indictment, and with which I do
</p>
<p>not at this moment trouble you, because, as your
</p>
<p>attention is confined to the present prisoner, it is un-
</p>
<p>necessary to do so. At the same time, in the course of
</p>
<p>this investigation, connecting, as we shall do, all these
</p>
<p>}iersons in one common plan and design, the acts and
</p>
<p>deelaiations of each will be most important, because
</p>
<p>they will all be answerable for the acts of each in
</p>
<p>furtherance of their common purpose. Upon that
</p>
<p>occasion they met at Ih'unt's, and it was then agieed
</p>
<p>that they should meet again on the following morning,

<p>IVf ondciy, February 2 1 .

<p>" After the })lans, I should tell you, on the Sunday
</p>
<p>were again rej)eated by ThistlcMOod, they were again
</p>
<p>approved by these })ersons. I think the lunnber who
</p>
<p>attended on that occasion amounted to fourteen or
</p>
<p>fifteen persons. They then agreed that no activity
</p>
<p>should be wanting in the mean time. I mean to

<p>prei)are that to which I shall by-and-by, call your

<p>attention, 'i'hcy met again on Monday at Brunt's.

</p>
<p>Tuesday the S2d of February, a meeting took place
</p>
<p>again in the morning, at Brunt's ; and u})on that
</p>
<p>occasion, one of the parties communicated to some
</p>
<p>who were present, that he had discovered by the
</p>
<p>newspapers, that a cabinet dinner was to be given on
</p>
<p>the following day, Wednesday, at my Lord Harrow by's,
</p>
<p>in Grosvenor-sc^uare. Gentlemen, you will be shocked
</p>
<p>when you come to hear the evidence detailed, to find
</p>
<p>with what exultation this intelligence was received.
</p>
<p>Brunt, with an impiety which must shock every
</p>
<p>well-regulated mind, exclaimed, * that till then he
</p>
<p>disbelieved the existence of a God, but that now he
</p>
<p>was satisfied the Almighty was favouring their de-
</p>
<p>signs, and that this dinner was appointed by Provi-
</p>
<p>dence on the following day to enable them at one
</p>
<p>blow to efiect that purjiose which liad been levelled
</p>
<p>against each of his ^Majesty's ministers separately, and
</p>
<p>that they might be enabled by that means to ac-
</p>
<p>complish at once, the whole destruction they me-
</p>
<p>ditated.' The exultation was not confined to him ;
</p>
<p>you will find, that Ings and the other persons present
</p>
<p>equally rejoiced at the prospect of a speedy termina-
</p>
<p>tion of their nefarious purposes, and ho})ing that on
</p>
<p>the following night they should at length attain that
</p>
<p>which was so great an object of their desire, and
</p>
<p>which they had pursued with the utmost anxiety. The
</p>
<p>neus})aper was then sent for, to see if the intelligence
</p>
<p>was true. On being brought it was inmiediately
</p>
<p>determined, that instead of the plan of endeavouring
</p>
<p>to assas>inatc some of his Majesty's ministers at their
</p>
<p>respective houses, that my Lord Harrowby's should be
</p>
<p>the place of attack; and that there in the evening, be-
</p>
<p>tween eight and nine o'clock, after all the guests were
</p>

</p>
<p>" Ihcn- activity on this intelligence being received,
</p>
<p>was redoubled ; they met again in the evening  their

<p>their fire-arms, the ammunition they had previously

<p>collected, and the different instruments of mischief
</p>
<p>nhich you will lind they had prepared for execution,
</p>
<p>and that they should he in a state of preparation on
</p>
<p>the lollowini^ evening to effect this |)urpose. I should
</p>
<p>have stated to you, gentlemen, before I had come to
</p>
<p>this part of the narrative, that a person of tlie name
</p>
<p>of 'i'idd, who is also included in this indictment, and
</p>
<p>v\ho lived, I beheve in the Hole-in-the-VVall-alley,
</p>
<p>13rooks'-market, was one of the conspirators, and
</p>
<p>had eml)arked in these plans. His house was made
</p>
<p>the depot of arms and ammunition.
</p>
<p>" As the meeting of the consjiirators had been
</p>
<p>held at Urunt's, they had a suspicion that their pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings might be watched, and they thought it
</p>
<p>unsafe that that should be the place of deposit, and
</p>
<p>therefore Tidd's house had, for some time, been the
</p>
<p>dej)ository for the arms and ammunition which had
</p>
<p>been collected.
</p>
<p>" As Brunt's house was, as you know, at some
</p>
<p>considerable distance from Grosvcnor-square, where
</p>
<p>tile commencement of this scene of blood was to
</p>
<p>Vdkc place, they thought it would be better to procure
</p>
<p>some place of rendezvous nearer to the house of
</p>
<p>Lord Ilarrowby ; and you will lind therefore, though
</p>
<p>it was not communicated at that moment to the
</p>
<p>ditferent parties, who were to be engaged in the
</p>
<p>transaction, that a place was procured at the west end
</p>
<p>of tiie town, in Cato-strcet, which runs into John-
</p>
<p>street, and thence to the J'2dgcware-road. A place
</p>
<p>was there procured by Harrison, anodier of the
</p>
<p>conspirators, for the ])urjM)se of meeting on the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing evening, preparatory to tlieir going to Gros-
</p>

<p>nature, that some of the parties, previous to the

<p>lincl ill evidence, in this case, that upon tlie Tuesday,
</p>
<p>the day on which the intelhgence was received that
</p>
<p>the dinner was to be at Lord Harrow by's the next
</p>
<p>day, whicli really was the case, one person of the
</p>
<p>name of lliden, who had these plans communicated
</p>
<p>to him, because it was hoped that he would become
</p>
<p>a participator in their designs, felt such compunction
</p>
<p>as to compel him to communicate to Lord Ilarrowby
</p>
<p>the plan that was designed ; and you will Ihid, that
</p>
<p>upon that day, this i)erson took an opportunity of
</p>
<p>watcliing Lord Harrowby from his house, on horse-
</p>
<p>back, into the park, and there he generally conunu-
</p>
<p>nicatcd to him that some mischief was intended
</p>
<p>against him, and therefore forewarned him of it.
</p>
<p>*' It will also appear to you, that at their meeting
</p>
<p>on Tuesday some little alarm had been excited in
</p>
<p>the minds of some of the party, by a jierson named
</p>
<p>Adams, wlio had been told by the publican at the
</p>
<p>White Hart, that their meetings had been suspected,
</p>
<p>and that thev were in some hazard of bcinG; discovered.
</p>
<p>He therefore stated to Thistlewood, and others, on
</p>
<p>Tuesday, that a communication had been made to
</p>
<p>him by the landlord that their meetings at the White
</p>
<p>Hart public-house had been observed by some of the
</p>
<p>])olice officers, and therefore he expressed his appre-
</p>
<p>hensions, that their plans had been discovered, or
</p>
<p>were likely to be discovered. This excited in the
</p>
<p>minds of those present the greatest agitation. They
</p>
<p>were astonished that Adams should have ventured at
</p>
<p>such a meeting, consisting of fourteen or fifteen per-
</p>
<p>sons, to hint that there was a possibility of their plans
</p>
<p>being discovered. The intelligence j)ro(iuced the
</p>
<p>greatest alarm, and they immediately took into con-
</p>
<p>sideration what was best to do.

</p>
<p>tain to their satisfaction whether or not their plans
</p>
<p>liad been discovered ; and you will find that the sug-
</p>
<p>gestion of Brunt uas carried into effect, by sending
</p>
<p>two or three parties, amongst whom was a man
</p>
<p>named Davidson, who will be a very conspicuous
</p>
<p>person throughout this transaction, and one of the
</p>
<p>most active partizans, to watch the house. They
</p>
<p>sent him and another person about six o'clock that
</p>
<p>evening, to watch Lord Harrowby's house, and they
</p>
<p>were to be relieved between eight and nine o'clock by
</p>
<p>two others of the party, who were to keep three hours'
</p>
<p>watch ; at the end of which time they were to be re-
</p>
<p>lieved by others, who, in their turn, would be relieved
</p>
<p>by four in the morning. It will be proved to you
</p>
<p>that they actually went there on that night, and were
</p>
<p>seen by different persons in Grosvenor-square, watch-
</p>
<p>ing Lord Harrowby's house for the purpose mentioned,
</p>
<p>and finding, as \vas the case, that there appeared to
</p>
<p>be no alarm  that there were no police otHcers, or
</p>
<p>troops of any description introduced into Lord Har-
</p>
<p>rowby's house, or stationed in the neighbourhood,
</p>
<p>they felt quite satisfied that it was a groundless alarm
</p>
<p>on tlie part of Adams  that there was no foundation
</p>
<p>for suspecting that any of their plans were discovered ;
</p>
<p>and tliereforc they proceeded without hesitation or
</p>
<p>dread to complete, as far as they could, the purpose
</p>
<p>they had in view.
</p>
<p>"On tlie Wednesday morning, great preparations
</p>
<p>were made. Arms were brought by Brunt in great
</p>
<p>abundance to the stable in Cato-street ; they consisted
</p>
<p>of sabres, swords, guns, pistols, and other destructive
</p>
<p>instruments of offence. But one of the most terrific

</p>
<p>poses, and which they prepared themselves, was what
</p>
<p>was called a hand-grenade. It was com})osed in this
</p>
<p>way  there was a quantity of gunpowder enclosed in
</p>
<p>a tin case, three or four inches in circumference,
</p>
<p>round which was tied a (|uantity of tow, and on the
</p>
<p>outside was a (juantity of iron, in pieces of various
</p>
<p>126 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>descriptions, sharp-pointed, and otherwise shaped,
</p>
<p>Avhich were fastened together, and tied round with
</p>
<p>the sanie sort of material I have mentioned, so as to
</p>
<p>enable the instrument to explode with the greatest
</p>
<p>force ; and the object of this machine was stated with-
</p>
<p>out disguise to be this : that upon their entrance into
</p>
<p>Lord llarrowb^/'s house, it was to be lighted by a
</p>
<p>fusee, communicating with the powder, and then
</p>
<p>thrown into the room ; and by the explosion, the per-
</p>
<p>sons exposed to the mischief might be killed or
</p>
<p>wounded, as would naturally be the case. It seems
</p>
<p>they had prepared a great number of these destructive
</p>
<p>instruments ; I know not how many.
</p>
<p>" They had also prepared v.hat they, in their mode
</p>
<p>of expression, called illumination balls, made for the
</p>
<p>j)urpose of setting fire to any buildings which it was
</p>
<p>their object and purpose to destroy. They had pre-
</p>
<p>I)ared also a large quantity of ball cartridges, the
</p>
<p>amount of which will probably surprise you, consider-
</p>
<p>ing the apparently feeble means these persons had of
</p>
<p>procuring articles of this description. Will it be be-
</p>
<p>lieved, that they had prepared between 11 and 1,200
</p>
<p>rounds of ball cartridges? They had also prepared
</p>
<p>several sorts of cartridges of a different description,
</p>
<p>made with tlanncl bags, and had provided themselves
</p>
<p>with a very large quantity of ])Owder. They had
</p>
<p>also prepared a great number of })ikes, and pike
</p>
<p>handles, for the purpose of arming their friends and
</p>
<p>associates, who had no other arms. All these pre-
</p>
<p>])arations must, obviously, have been the work of a
</p>
<p>considerable length of time. They must have been
</p>
<p>the h'uits of very great labour, and they were all ])re-
</p>
<p>])ared and ready on the 23d of February for tbcir in-
</p>
<p>tended oj)erations.

<p>"On the morning of the 23d of February, several
</p>
<p>ot the consjVirators assembled at Brunt's house, where
</p>
<p>thcv were (iigugcd in completing their hand-grenades,

</p>

</p>
<p>by Brunt's apprentice. I have already told you, that
</p>
<p>for the purpose of their meeting, and for the conve-
</p>
<p>nience of having some place near to Lord Ilarrowby's
</p>
<p>house, a stable had been hired by one of the conspi-
</p>
<p>rators in Cato-street, near the Edgeware-road.
</p>
<p>" I know not whether curiosity has led any of you,
</p>
<p>as it has done a great many of tlie public, to visit the
</p>
<p>place ; but if it has not, I w ill endeavour to describe
</p>
<p>the situation, and I think you will agree wuth me, that
</p>
<p>a more appropriate situation for the purpose contem-
</p>
<p>plated could hardly be selected. It is an obscure
</p>
<p>street, having a very narrow access at either end- I
</p>
<p>think at one end there is not any access for carriages,
</p>
<p>and at the other there is an archway, and under it
</p>
<p>posts, to prevent none but foot-passengers going in or
</p>
<p>out. The east end passes into John-street, and the
</p>
<p>west end, which is a very narrow cartway, runs into
</p>
<p>Queen-street, both John-street and Queen-street run-
</p>
<p>ning parallel with each other into the Edgewarc-road.
</p>
<p>The stable is the hrst building as you enter Cato-street
</p>
<p>from John-street on the right-hand side of the way,
</p>
<p>and it is nearly opposite the small public-house, called
</p>
<p>by the sign of the Horse and Groom. The stable had
</p>
<p>been occupied by General ^V'atson, who is abroad,
</p>
<p>and rented of; him by a person of the name of Firth,
</p>
<p>by whom it was let to Harrison for this purpose. It
</p>
<p>consists below stairs of a stable, with three stalls, and a
</p>
<p>small place adjoining, for the reception of a carriage
</p>
<p>or cart ; and at the further end of it, nearly opposite
</p>
<p>the door, as you enter, is a step-ladder leading up
</p>
<p>into the loft over the stable, on the side of w hich are
</p>
<p>two small rooms, which are innnediately over the
</p>
<p>cart or coach-house.

<p>meeting on that evening, which was to take place
</p>
<p>about seven or eight o'clock, preparations had been
</p>
<p>made by Harri-on, and several others of the party in
</p>
<p>the stable, for the leception of those who were to be
</p>
<p>assembled. In order to avoid the observation of the
</p>
<p>neighbourhood, some pieces of canvass had been
</p>
<p>128 CATO-STRFET CONSPIRACr.
</p>
<p>nailed up against the window of the loft, to prevent
</p>
<p>persons from observing on the opposite side of the
</p>
<p>stieet what might be passing ; and it was remarked by
</p>
<p>several of the neighbours, that this place was visited
</p>
<p>by a great number of persons during the afternoon,
</p>
<p>w ho were carrying something on their backs which the
</p>
<p>neighbours did not discover, but which, I have no
</p>
<p>doubt, Mere the arms and other implements of mis-
</p>
<p>chief collected there, and found when the prisoners
</p>
<p>were taken. Harrison, who was known to be one of
</p>
<p>those persons, was observed going into the stable in
</p>
<p>the afternoon ; and on being asked what his purpose
</p>
<p>was in going there, he said, he had taken it from
</p>
<p>Firth, and was cleaning it out. About six o'clock,
</p>
<p>Davidson, the man of colour, was also observed by
</p>
<p>some of these persons residing close to the stable,
</p>
<p>going in with something on his back, and under his
</p>
<p>arm, which they could not discover, and a number of
</p>
<p>candles in his hand. You will find that he applied at
</p>
<p>one of the houses adjoining the stable, at six o'clock,
</p>
<p>to light one of these'candles, with which he went into
</p>
<p>the stable. A party was to meet at Brunt's lodgings,
</p>
<p>in order to proceed from thence to this stable. Tidd,
</p>
<p>whose name I have already mentioned, and who lived
</p>
<p>in the Hole-in-thc- Wall-alley, was to accompany ano-
</p>
<p>ther party. They had not communicated to all the
</p>
<p>party, at first, the precise place of meeting, but some
</p>
<p>were to nieet at the Horse and Groom, and others
</p>
<p>were to go to the Edgeu are-road, near John-street,
</p>
<p>where some of the conspirators were to shew them
</p>
<p>to the place of rendezvous.
</p>
<p>" Between seven and eight o'clock Brunt, and
</p>
<p>some others from his house, took their departure with
</p>
<p>arms, with which they had there provided themselves,

<p>and concealed under their coats, to this stable in
</p>
<p>Cato-street. They met there Thistlewood, Ings,
</p>
<p>Wilson, and some others, and here they proceeded
</p>
<p>to arm iheniselves with the weapons provided, and
</p>
<p>whicli were afterwards found ; such as guns, pist(Vls,
</p>
<p>swords, a great number of hand-grenades, and a con-
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF TIIlSTLEWOOn. I'Jfj
</p>
<p>siderable number of pikes, rudely formed, but siifli-
</p>
<p>cient for the purpose of doing incrcdii)!e mischief.
</p>
<p>The handles of the pikes were composed of rough ash
</p>
<p>sticks of a large size, the ends of which were {)laned
</p>
<p>otF, to admit a ferrule, and at the end was stuck a pike-
</p>
<p>head or bayonet ; for articles of both descriptions
</p>
<p>were found, screwed on for the purpose of bciu"-
</p>
<p>afterwards used.
</p>
<p>*' At first their party at Cato-street consisted only
</p>
<p>of fourteen or fifteen persons, and some little alarm
</p>
<p>was excited, and some little suspicion evidently raised,
</p>
<p>in the mind of Thistlewood and some others, at Tidd's
</p>
<p>not making his appearance at the appointed time, for
</p>
<p>there being some remarks made that their number was
</p>
<p>not so large as was expected, it was stated by Thistle-
</p>
<p>wood, and by some others, that there were other per-
</p>
<p>sons, who would by-and-by assemble, and that other
</p>
<p>parties were gone for ditlerent purposes about the me-
</p>
<p>tropolis, ^\ho were not to accompany them to Lord
</p>
<p>Ilarrowhy's house in Grosvenor-squarc. In a short
</p>
<p>time afterwards, ho\\cver, Tidd made his appeai'ance
</p>
<p>with a person named Monument, who will be produced
</p>
<p>as a v.itness ; a person who hud only been recently in-
</p>
<p>duced to participate in their schemes  who a short
</p>
<p>time before had been introduced to Thistlewood, and
</p>
<p>who had an intimation generally with respect to their
</p>
<p>particular views ; but he had not been admitted to a
</p>
<p>knowledge of the whole scope of the plan, until he
</p>
<p>arrived at Cato-street, although lie might be aware
</p>
<p>that their object was to overturn the Governnient in
</p>
<p>some way or other. He arrived, however, with Tidd
</p>
<p>about seven o'clock, and the party at that time con-
</p>
<p>sisted of about twenty-five persons ; two of them were
</p>
<p>appointed to remain as sentries belou- stairs to })re-

<p>vent any interruption. These persons were Davidson
</p>
<p>and Ings, and they remained on guard whilst^ie other
</p>
<p>conspirators were above stairs talking over their plans,
</p>
<p>and making the final arrangements for proceeding to
</p>
<p>Lord Harrowby's house, in Grosvenor-square, which
</p>
<p>they proposed to do between seven and eiglit o'clock.
</p>
<p>130 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>Some alarm, as I have already told you, had prevailed
</p>
<p>ill the party. Some of them expressed a fear that
</p>
<p>their own strength was hardly adequate to the object
</p>
<p>in view. Upon which Thistlewood and Ings said the
</p>
<p>opportunity must not be lost ; that there was enough
</p>
<p>to complete the purpose of destroying his {Majesty's
</p>
<p>ministers ; that when that was accomplished, the other
</p>
<p>consequences would follow; that they should have
</p>
<p>parties ready to set fire to difterent parts of the metro-
</p>
<p>polis ; that they would be joined by immense numbers
</p>
<p>the moment the first blow was struck, and therefore,
</p>
<p>there could be no hesitation in their minds to execute
</p>
<p>the intended purpose.
</p>
<p>'' Having thus assembled their forces, and pre-
</p>
<p>pared themselves for the desperate object of their
</p>
<p>enterprise, they began between seven and eight o'clock
</p>
<p>to consider who should be the party to enter Lord
</p>
<p>Harrowby's house to destroy the ministers. The plan
</p>
<p>had been, that Thistlewood was to knock at the door,
</p>
<p>under the pretence of having a note to deliver to
</p>
<p>Lord Harrovvby, and by that means having obtained
</p>
<p>access to the hall, they were to compel the servants to
</p>
<p>shew them to the room where the ministers were
</p>
<p>assembled ; that they were to secure the servants, who,
</p>
<p>they naturally believed, would be soon overpowered,
</p>
<p>an(l should then immediately make their way into the
</p>
<p>room ; and then they should, without discrimination,
</p>
<p>widiout reserve, or without any remorse, destroy
</p>
<p>every one of his Majesty's ministers who should be
</p>
<p>assembled.
</p>
<p>" I have stated to you, gcnUemen, already the
</p>
<p>exultation and impiety displayed by Brunt on one
</p>
<p>occasion, when he contemplated the completion of his
</p>
<p>sanguinary purpose ; and I cannot conceal from you

<p>one fact, us it atil'cts the man named Ings, which will

<p>shp out of his liand ; and he stated, in languaL'e of the
</p>
<p>most i^ross and iiorrible import, that with this knite lie
</p>
<p>"would himself effect the nmrder and mutilation of
</p>
<p>some of the persons who should be assembled. The
</p>
<p>cruelty of the designs this man expressed, is bcvond
</p>
<p>all description. The scenes, in fact, which had dis-
</p>
<p>graced another country some }ears back, were to be
</p>
<p>acted again on British ground, and the heads of some
</p>
<p>of the ministers were to be triumphantly paraded
</p>
<p>through the streets, to procure converts to tliis de-
</p>
<p>testable cause ! Gentlemen, that very knife was found
</p>
<p>upon, and taken from, that man ; and I mention that
</p>
<p>only as a corroborating fact, if corroboration be
</p>
<p>needed. Gentlemen, thank Heaven, that Piovidence
</p>
<p>which kindly watches over the acts and thoughts of
</p>
<p>men, mercifully interposed between the conception of
</p>
<p>this abominable plot, and its completion, which was all
</p>
<p>but ])erfcctcd.
</p>
<p>" In consequence of the communication made to
</p>
<p>Lord Harrowby, measures were taken in other quarters
</p>
<p>to ])revent the impending danger. It being stated
</p>
<p>that these persons had met in Cato-street, for the
</p>
<p>purposes I have already mentioned, means weie im-
</p>
<p>mediately taken to secure the conspirators, which,
</p>
<p>however, were not so effectual as could have been
</p>
<p>Avished, but certainly so far as to })revent the execution
</p>
<p>of their dreadful jiurposcs. In order to remove all
</p>
<p>suspicion from the minds of the conspirators, it was
</p>
<p>determined by Lord Harrowby, that tlie pr('j)arations
</p>
<p>for the dinner, which he had intended untioubtedlv for
</p>
<p>liis iNIajesty's ministers, on that occasion, should go
</p>
<p>on ; and in order that tliere sliould be no suspicion in

<p>the house of my Lord Harrowby, his servants \\evc
</p>
<p>desired to })rocecd in the necessary airangements for
</p>
<p>the dinner, because there is no doubt, that if any
</p>
<p>alteration had taken place in the arraniiements of the
</p>
<p>dav, it would have been connnunicated to the con-
</p>
<p>spirators ; and if they susjiectcd that the dinner was
</p>
<p>jj^:: CATO-bTUEF/r CONSPIllACV.
</p>
<p>not irilendcd to take place, they would have changed
</p>
<p>their measures, and the ends of justice would have
</p>
<p>been defeated.
</p>
<p>" In consequence, therefore, of the seeming perse-
</p>
<p>verance in the d(.^sign of having a cabinet dinner, all
</p>
<p>suspicion was removed from the minds of the Cato-
</p>
<p>street conspirators, who no doubt expected that they
</p>
<p>should be enabled, from tlie short distance of their
</p>
<p>rendezvous, to reach Lord liarrowby's in about ten
</p>
<p>minutes or a quarter of an liour, and accomplish their
</p>
<p>purpose unmolested  a circumstance not unlikely,
</p>
<p>considering that the hour of eight was chosen ; con-
</p>
<p>sidering tiiat the neighbourhood was the most quiet
</p>
<p>and retiied in London ; at a time, too, when the in-
</p>
<p>habitants oftlie st|uare and its vicinity were employed
</p>
<p>in domestic retirement; at that liour when suspicion
</p>
<p>must be lulled asleep, and when no apprehensions
</p>
<p>could be entertained of personal danger ; for that
</p>
<p>hour, and that moment was chosen by tlie Cato-street
</p>
<p>conspirators to issue from the scene of their nefarious
</p>
<p>deliberations. Precautions, however, had been taken
</p>
<p>as 1 have stated to you, in order to prevent the acconi-
</p>
<p>j)lishment of their designs. A number of Bow-street
</p>
<p>oftieers antl pa'a\.], had been directed to go to the
</p>
<p>spot, and endeavour to watch their niovements, and
</p>
<p>counteract their operations, before they took their
</p>
<p>departure, and endeavour to secure the whole
</p>
<p>assemblage.
</p>
<p>" A party of the Ciuards also were to attend in John-
</p>
<p>street, to assist tlie police; and, just at the moment
</p>
<p>that these persons were about to set out, and when
</p>
<p>'J'histlevvood was calling over those who were to
</p>
<p>separate from the rest to execute this horrible plan,

<p>the otlicers entered the loft. Upon their entrance

<p>int(^ the stable below, they found two persons there,
</p>
<p>armed, who will be proved to be Davidson, for his
</p>
<p>eoKuir, which is nearly black, was perceived; he had
</p>
<p>a double belt round his waist, in which were pistols

<p>and ;i cutlass, and he liad a gun over his shoulder ;

<p>th(y found him inside the door, and another person,

<p>who will be distinctly identitied to be Ings. lie was
</p>
<p>found lit the bottom of the ladder, with this knife,
</p>
<p>with a cutlass, a sword, and with pistols.
</p>
<p>*' The officers, witli a resolution and courage which
</p>
<p>does tlieni high honour, considering the desperation
</p>
<p>and detcru]ination of these characters, immediately
</p>
<p>ascended the ladder without securing the persons
</p>
<p>bclo\\'. Tiiey merely gave directions to those who
</p>
<p>followed, to keep them secure, and they thought tliat
</p>
<p>would be enough, widiout actually confming them.
</p>
<p>The first man ^vho went up was a person of the
</p>
<p>name of Ruthven, who will be called to you : he was
</p>
<p>followed by a man named Ellis : after whom came a
</p>
<p>n:ian, of whom you have undoubtedly heard before,
</p>
<p>named Smitlicrs, wiio met his death by the hand of
</p>
<p>Thisdcwood.
</p>
<p>" On Sinithers ascending the ladder, either Ings or
</p>
<p>Davidson hallooed out' from below, as a signal for
</p>
<p>them to be; on their guard above, and upon lluthven
</p>
<p>ascending the ladder, Thistlewood, w!io was at a
</p>
<p>litde distance from the landinii-place, and who was
</p>
<p>distinctly seen, for there were several lights in the
</p>
<p>place, receded a feu- ])aces, and the |)ulice-offieers
</p>
<p>announced who they were, and demanded a surrender.
</p>
<p>Smithers unfortunately pressed forward in the direc-
</p>
<p>tion in which Thistlewood had retreated, into one of
</p>
<p>the sniall rooms over the coach-house, when Thisdc-
</p>
<p>wood drew back his arm, in which there was a sword,
</p>
<p>and made a thrust at the unfortunate man, Smithers,
</p>
<p>who received a wound near his heart, and, with i.m\y
</p>
<p>time to exclaim, " Oh ! God !" he fell a lifeless
</p>
<p>corp'-e into the arms of Ellis. Ellis, seeing Uiis l)low
</p>
<p>given bv Thistlewood, immediately discharged a
</p>
<p>pistol at him, which missed its aim. (ireat confusion

</p>
<p>he shot at another of the officers as he came down
</p>
<p>the ladder, and pressed througli the stable, cutting at
</p>
<p>all Nvho attempted to oppose him, and made his
</p>
<p>escape out into John-street, the military not having
</p>
<p>yet arrived ; and he was no more seen at that time,
</p>
<p>except with a sword in his hand in the Edgware-road.
</p>
<p>]]y the other persons an equally desperate resistance
</p>
<p>was made.
</p>
<p>" Conscious of the evil purpose for which tliey
</p>
<p>had assembled, they waited not to know on what
</p>
<p>charge they were about to be apprehended ; but in-
</p>
<p>stantly made a most desperate resistance. Ings,
</p>
<p>Davidson, and Wilson, were particularly des})erate,
</p>
<p>each, I believe, firing at some of the officers or
</p>
<p>military, who had only come to the ground on hearing
</p>
<p>tile re{)ort of the hre-arms, not having been j)reviously
</p>
<p>directed to the exact spot.
</p>
<p>" Notwithstanding the resistance, however, which
</p>
<p>they so desperately made, and in which resistance
</p>
<p>Thistlewood, Tidd, Davidson, Ings, and Wilson
</p>
<p>took a most active part, by attacking the officers and
</p>
<p>soldiers, the whole of the conspirators were, at length,
</p>
<p>fortunately overconjc, and eventually eleven of them
</p>
<p>secured. Not on that night, however, for three
</p>
<p>out of the eleven for the time escaped, namely This-
</p>
<p>tlewood, Brunt, and Harrison. The officers, how-
</p>
<p>ever, not onlv secured on that nisjht the eidit men,

<p>but various articles of tire-arms, numerous weapons,

<p>and certain combustibles.

<p>lowinir, he called to him the apprentice boy I iuive
</p>
<p>named, and asked him as to his kno^vledge of some
</p>
<p>street in the Borough, MJiere he wanted to convey
</p>
<p>some baskets. These were all cureUilly packed up,
</p>
<p>and it is a remarkable circumstance, which will be
</p>
<p>spoken to in evidence, that so anxious w as he ibr die
</p>
<p>concealment of its contents, that one of the baskets
</p>
<p>was secured with the apron of his wife ! Gentleinen,
</p>
<p>the j)risoner now thought all secure ; but he had
</p>
<p>scarcely elf'ected his plan, and retired into another
</p>
<p>room, previous to despatching the baskets, when the
</p>
<p>oriicers entered the house and seized him. This, you
</p>
<p>may suppose, was not a little surprising to Brunt ; for,
</p>
<p>most material would it have been to him to have the
</p>
<p>baskets removed. Upon searching these, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>were found a number of hand-grenades, fire-balls,
</p>
<p>and other articles of destruction. Upon their disco-
</p>
<p>very, Brunt for some time affected ignorance of the
</p>
<p>tiling, but he was told it was of no use.
</p>
<p>" The prisoner at the bar, Thistleuood, who also
</p>
<p>escaped on the ni(j;ht of the !3d, retired not to his
</p>
<p>own house, however, but to an obscure lodging
</p>
<p>ill V/liite-street, where he thought to conceal him-
</p>
<p>self. Information, however, soon reached the police-
</p>
<p>otlice, Bow-street, of his retreat, and early the next
</p>
<p>morning, a strong party of officers, headed by Bishop,
</p>
<p>were sent to apprehend him. Upon their arrival at
</p>
<p>the place, every precaution was, of course, taken to
</p>
<p>prevent an alarm ; while the officers, at the same time,
</p>
<p>knowing the dcsjierate sort of character they had to
</p>
<p>contend with, were equally guarded to resist any
</p>
<p>attack which might be made upon them. They pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to search the house, beginning with the to[)
</p>
<p>and descencHng to the lower rooms. They then ob-

<p>served a small room on the ground-tloor, the door of
</p>
<p>which was locked, and Bisliop demanded the key,
</p>
<p>which he procured; and knouiiig from what had taken
</p>
<p>{)lace, the ('.etermined desperation of this man, he
</p>
<p>opened the door as softly as lie could, and perceived
</p>
<p>136 CATO-STRKF.T CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>by some slight light that came through two or
</p>
<p>three holes in the window-shutters, the person of
</p>
<p>Thistlewood lying on a turn-down bed. The moment
</p>
<p>he opened the door, Thistlewood put his head up, and
</p>
<p>Bishop immediately discovered him, and he imme-
</p>
<p>diately threw himself upon him, to prevent mischief.
</p>
<p>He then said, he should make no resistance, and on
</p>
<p>being taken out of bed, it was discovered that he had
</p>
<p>been laying in his breeches and stockings. Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, by these means the prisoner at the bar was
</p>
<p>taken ; and thus ends, in point of fact, the evidence
</p>
<p>which will be adduced before you.
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, I have now to state to you, at the
</p>
<p>suggestion of a learned friend, a fact which I had
</p>
<p>almost forgotten. It is material for you to know,
</p>
<p>that on the 22d February, the conspirators held a
</p>
<p>consultation at the house of Brunt. Every thing
</p>
<p>was, on this occasion considered as finally arranged.
</p>
<p>I have already told you, it was their })lan to
</p>
<p>f-ict fire to various parts of the metropolis, and
</p>
<p>among other places, the barracks in King-street
</p>
<p>w^ere fixed upon, not only because troops would be
</p>
<p>there, but because Harrison, who bad been, I am
</p>
<p>sorry to say, in his I\lajcsty's service, was acquainted
</p>
<p>with the situation of the building, and pointed out
</p>
<p>the means by which it could he easily fired ; and
</p>
<p>thus the soldiers, who would have retired to rest,
</p>
<p>would be unable to accoutre themselves or their horses.
</p>
<p>But this is not all, gentlenicn ; for at this very con-
</p>
<p>sultation, Thistlewood sat down and wrote two
</p>
<p>proclamations, in anticipation of the success of his
</p>
<p>diabolical schemes, and which proclamations were
</p>
<p>upon that success to be issued, liutyou will observe,
</p>
<p>gentlemen, it was not considered by the prisoner duly

<p>oiticial to write these pioclamations on paper, and
</p>
<p>Hale (the apprentice of Brant) was sent in search
</p>
<p>of j)aichincnt. This being procured, he wrote an
</p>
<p>address to the following effect, intended for the people
</p>
<p>generally :

</p>
<p>tained of these men's ulterior desii2;ns not beini!; con-
</p>
<p>fined to the destruction of his Majesty's Ministers,
</p>
<p>this proclamation, written by Thistlewood, would put
</p>
<p>it beyond all doubt. He wrote two or three of these.
</p>
<p>He read them aloud to the j)arty assembled, and told
</p>
<p>them that they were to be stuck up where the houses
</p>
<p>Mere on tire, that tlie peo[)Ie miglit see it. Afterwards
</p>
<p>he sat down, and endeavoured to compose another
</p>
<p>proclamation, which was to be issued to tlie soldiers,
</p>
<p>and that contained an offer to the soldiers, callinii on
</p>
<p>them to join the friends of Liberty; promisinif them
</p>
<p>twenty pounds each to carry t!iem home, and tiiat they
</p>
<p>should be rewarded with full pay and a pension for
</p>
<p>life ! ! The-e proclamations, Gentlemen, were read
</p>
<p>aloud by Thistlewood to the conspirators, and they
</p>
<p>were unanimously approved. Someofthem, I should
</p>
<p>tell you, were to be posted as convenient as possible
</p>
<p>to every barrack or public place which miirht be set fire
</p>
<p>to or destroyed. Thistlewood himself carried the
</p>
<p>proclamations from the house of Brant to Cato-street.
</p>
<p>" And now, Gentlemen, having stated these facts,
</p>
<p>let mc pause to ask you, \vhether, it 1 [)rove them in
</p>
<p>evidence, you can come to any other conclusion than
</p>
<p>that the prisoner who stands bcibre you, is <::niity ?
</p>
<p>What answer, I will ask, can be given to such evi-
</p>
<p>dence as this, and if no answer Ciin be oi\en in evi-

</p>
<p>principle did not exist ; for here were long laid regular
</p>
<p>plans, extensive schemes, and the most abundant pre-
</p>
<p>parations, to effect a wicked purpose. And will not
</p>
<p>desperate and designing men, infuriated by their pas-
</p>
<p>sions either influence others to the accomplishment of
</p>
<p>such plans, or be worked upon by them themselves.
</p>
<p>Look then, Gentlemen, to the facts of the case your-
</p>
<p>selves. You will view them as calm and sober men,
</p>
<p>and in doing so, you will perceive such a system and
</p>
<p>such an adroitness towards the execution of that system,
</p>
<p>that their object requires but little solution.
</p>
<p>" Gentlem.en, it is not your duty to consider whether
</p>
<p>the schemes in question were wild and visionary, but
</p>
<p>whether they had for their object an illegal or wicked
</p>
<p>purpose ; and if illegal, and that towards the execu-
</p>
<p>tion of their plans they took but one step, they have
</p>
<p>then done that \\hich renders them amenable to the
</p>
<p>offended laws of their country. If these arguments,
</p>
<p>Gentlemen, won't avail, what then may not be urged
</p>
<p>for the prisoner ? But you will also be told that ac-
</p>
<p>complices are not to be believed on their oath in a
</p>
<p>Court of Justice. I contend, howe\^er, that they
</p>
<p>should ; and if it was not permitted to accomplices
</p>
<p>in guilt to give evidence for the purposes of justice,
</p>
<p>then the blackest and foulest crimes would be daily
</p>
<p>committed, and go un{)unished. But it is not the
</p>
<p>law of England, alone, to hear the evidence of an
</p>
<p>accomplice. It is the law of reason also, and has
</p>
<p>been the law of all ages and nations. I admit that
</p>
<p>you should watch \vilh the greatest caution and
</p>
<p>jealousy the testimony of an accomplice. You should
</p>
<p>weigh his story well, and see whether it be con-
</p>
<p>firmed by the more inditferent witnesses. Not con-
</p>
<p>firmed in every part, for then his evidence would not

</p>
<p>be required at all : but in certain collateral parts
</p>
<p>which may be found to correspond with the other
</p>
<p>testimony. If therefore, Gentlemen, an accomplice
</p>
<p>is produced before you, and you believe a part of ^^hat
</p>
<p>he relates, you are bound in a great measure to be-
</p>
<p>lieve that the whole of what he tells vou is true.

<p>Tlie plans, therefore, at least for some time, could be

<p>lon- been the law of En^iland to receive the evidence
</p>
<p>ot an accomplice, and e\en in cases of murder, it has
</p>
<p>proved most salutary in the admiui-tration of jus-
</p>
<p>lice.
</p>
<p>" I \\iil call a witness before voi;,Gep.tiemen, named
</p>
<p>Adams, an accomjvlice, as you will lind, aiul he be ing
</p>
<p>in the full coniidcnce of the consj)irators, \'dl! jtrove
</p>
<p>to vou the nature of all their proceedings froiu time
</p>
<p>to time, and of the ditferent plans and coniUiunications
</p>
<p>which were hiauc bet'.\cen him and them. I will call
</p>
<p>another man to you, Gentlemen, who was the first to
</p>
<p>make known the diabolical plans of the con^[)irators,
</p>
<p>to ujy Lord Harrow by ; but this man ^vas not much
</p>
<p>known to tliem, nor did he tlierefore rank hi'.di in
</p>
<p>their councils.

<p>tion and death, hi,^ heart sliuddered, his conscience

<p>smote him, and he could hold out no longer. Souie
</p>
<p>men, you know, ha\e very strong minds, and are nut

<p>to be deterred from die most Avickcd purpose. Gthers

<p>are less llrm, and more easily shaken in the accom-

<p>name is liiden, is one of this desciiption.
</p>
<p>" A third witness I sliall produce to you, is an indivi-
</p>
<p>dual w ho was rather n)ore in confalence with the con-
</p>
<p>spirators. His name is Dwyer, and you will find that
</p>
<p>Thistlewood and Davidson applied to him for his ad-
</p>
<p>,. n

<p>liO C:A1()-S I II K t- 1 COX.^PI RACY .
</p>
<p>vice and assistance towards the execution of their mur-
</p>
<p>derous pur()osc. You v^ il! even find that they sohcited
</p>
<p>his aid on the very day in M'hich that purpose was to
</p>
<p>be put into execution. Tiiis witness, however, horror-
</p>
<p>struck at the intended massacre, and feehng it to be
</p>
<p>his bounden duty, ran ahiiost instantly and communi-
</p>
<p>cated ttie fact toothers. He first communicated it to
</p>
<p>his wife, and next to an officer in the army, named
</p>
<p>James, with a view that it might be immediately con-
</p>
<p>veyed to his Majesty's ministers. This, under the
</p>
<p>special order of Providence, was done.
</p>
<p>" And now let me again ask you, Gentlemen, is this
</p>
<p>testimony to be rejected ? Surely it never can by en-
</p>
<p>lightened men such as you are. But this even does
</p>
<p>not furnish my case for the prosecution ; for I assure
</p>
<p>you it does not rest upon the testimony of Adams,
</p>
<p>Hiden, and Dwyer ; but there are facts in this case
</p>
<p>which, I fear, the prisoner will not be able to answer.
</p>
<p>Why, I would ask, were these men assembled in Cato-
</p>
<p>street, and why at night ? There were none of them
</p>
<p>related to each other, yet they were all armed with
</p>
<p>deadly weapons, and found in close deliberation in an
</p>
<p>obscure stable. There were also found there a quan-
</p>
<p>tity of destructive grenades and fire-balls, together
</p>
<p>with a large portion, of ammunition. But this is not
</p>
<p>all. At the houses of two others of the conspirators,
</p>
<p>namely, Brunt and Tidd, there were found similar arti-
</p>
<p>cles of destruction, particularly ammunition. The
</p>
<p>weight found of the latter, gentlemen, amounted to
</p>
<p>between eleven and twelve hundred pounds ; and I
</p>
<p>w^ould ask, in the name of God, what object could
</p>
<p>these men have had in the possession of such a quan-
</p>
<p>tity of anununition ? Surely it could not even be for an
</p>
<p>individual nmrder ! No, gentlemen, it was the de-

</p>
<p>" These men, Gentlemen, could never have been
</p>
<p>nnfrienclly towards ministers as individuals. It must
</p>
<p>have been a hatred of them in the eharacter of their
</p>
<p>oiiiee alone, and their de^iiin was nxjre j)articularlv
</p>
<p>levelled at Lord ITarrowIn-, hceause his Lordship was
</p>
<p>President of the CouneiL Can you doulit, that after
</p>
<p>this dreadful blow was made, and it had succeeded,
</p>
<p>that it was the intention of these conspirators to have
</p>
<p>established a jjrovisional government, and thus spread
</p>
<p>anarchy and confusion around. In fact, that was the
</p>
<p>eventual blow meant to be carried into execution. I
</p>
<p>sav, therefore, that even if tlie learned counsel
</p>
<p>for the prisonei's were to contend most successfully
</p>
<p>against the evidence of the accomplices, the facts
</p>
<p>I shall produce to you by other te^timony, will an-
</p>
<p>swer the pur[;oses of this just and necessary prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>" W'hdi was the conduct of the prisoners when they
</p>
<p>were discovered in Cato-street ? I want not, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, by a repetition of this term, to inflaujc your
</p>
<p>minds : but it will be extremely important for vou to
</p>
<p>remember, that when the otiicers entered the loft
</p>
<p>there, and saiti, ' ue are officers,' they submitted not
</p>
<p>to their authority, but resi>ted them even in the most
</p>
<p>ferocious manner, and one officer, as you have before
</p>
<p>heard, unfortunately lost his life. The prisoner at the
</p>
<p>bar, however, is not under trial for that offence, nor
</p>
<p>should the fatal circunjstance operate in the present
</p>
<p>case against him. But I must again ask you, what
</p>
<p>became of the prisoner on the 23d, the intended night
</p>
<p>of blood and slaughter ? ^Vhy he ffies from the despe-
</p>
<p>rate scene, not to his own home, as you have already
</p>
<p>been told, but to an obscure })lace of concealment.
</p>
<p>These, then, Gendemen, are tlie facts of this momen-

<p>tous case ; and once more I ask you, what possible
</p>
<p>conclusion can you draw from such facts, if they be
</p>
<p>supported in evidence ?
</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, 1 repeat it. that this is a momentous
</p>
<p>J42 CATO-.STRRET COXSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>and important case, and if these plots of tiie conspira-
</p>
<p>tors, and of the prisoner in particular, be proved to
</p>
<p>have existed  if the means had been used which 1
</p>
<p>have described to vou for effecting the nefarious and
</p>
<p>J o
</p>
<p>diabohcal [)lan3 they had formed, then I call upon you,
</p>
<p>in the name of justice, to give that verdict which will
</p>
<p>best satisfy the laws of your country, and tend to pro-
</p>
<p>tect the lives of your fellow-creatures. Commisera-
</p>
<p>tion (if I may use the term) towards a prisoner, I
</p>
<p>never should witlihold ; and God forbid, Gentlemen,
</p>
<p>that you should not give to the man at the bar the ad-
</p>
<p>vantage of every, even the slightest, circumstance of
</p>
<p>doubt which may arise in his favour. If these doubts
</p>
<p>also should predominate, it will be your duty to acquit
</p>
<p>the prisoner ; but if, on the other hand, the facts which
</p>
<p>I have laid before you be substantiated, and you feel
</p>
<p>in your consciences that the charge is made out, it will
</p>
<p>then become your painful but boundcn duty to convict
</p>
<p>him. Should these facts, I say, for the last time, be
</p>
<p>brought home to the prisoner, it vvill then be your
</p>
<p>duty, as men, as citizens, and as fathers  as men de-
</p>
<p>sirous of maintaining the laws, and of acting under the
</p>
<p>solemn obligation of your oaths, to pronounce him
</p>
<p>guilty."
</p>
<p>The learned gentleman's speech occupied the atten-
</p>
<p>tion of the Jury for nearly two hours.
</p>
<p>Before the hrst witness for the prosecution was put
</p>
<p>into the box, all the prisoners named in the indict-
</p>
<p>ment were brought up, with the view, we suppose, of
</p>
<p>having an opportunity of hearing the evidence, it being
</p>
<p>principally the same which is to be adduced against
</p>
<p>most of them. They entered the Court with much
</p>
<p>apparent indifference.

<p>Davidson and Ings were particularly remarked for
</p>
<p>the calm indifference with which they surveyed the
</p>
<p>Bench and the spectators around them.
</p>
<p>During the examination of Adams, some of the
</p>
<p>prisoners whispered together. Thistlewood through-
</p>
<p>out preserved the most perfect composure.
</p>
<p>Tit I A I. OF 1 HI^ILKWOUI), 143
</p>
<p>The first witness called was
</p>
<p>RoBER] Adams, examined by the Solicitor-
</p>
<p>General.  1 live at Xo. 4, in ilole-in-the-Wall-
</p>
<p>passau:e, Brooks'-markct. I am a shoemaker.
</p>
<p>I was in the Royal Regiment ol" Horse Guards,
</p>
<p>It is 18 years last Christmas since 1 lei't them. 1
</p>
<p>knew Brunt at Cambray, in France, he went then
</p>
<p>by the name of Thomas ?iiorton, it is IS years
</p>
<p>ag-o since I first knew him. I know Thistlewood.
</p>
<p>I knew him first on the IGth of January last. He
</p>
<p>then lived in Stanhope-street, Clare-market. I
</p>
<p>was introduced to him by Brunt and Ings. I saw
</p>
<p>him at his own place. We had some conver-
</p>
<p>sation together.
</p>
<p>Here Mr. Adolphus objected to the witness
</p>
<p>mentioning any thing of the conversation which
</p>
<p>passed on that occasion. The crime against the
</p>
<p>prisoner was charged in the reign of his present
</p>
<p>Majesty, and against his crown and dignity, and
</p>
<p>no act of the prisoners in the late reign ought to
</p>
<p>be adduced.
</p>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice Abbot said^ the Court
</p>
<p>might hear of the commencement of the transac-
</p>
<p>tion, as connected with what had occurred in the
</p>
<p>present reign.
</p>
<p>The examination of the W'itness was con-
</p>
<p>tinued.
</p>
<p>When I went in, Brunt said to Thistlewood,
</p>
<p>This is the man 1 was speaking to you about.
</p>
<p>Thistlewood said, " You were once in the Life-
</p>
<p>(iuards?" I said, " Xo, I was not, I originally
</p>
<p>belonged to the Blues.'" Thistlewood said, " You
</p>
<p>are a good swordsman ? ' 1 said, " 1 coukl use a
</p>
<p>sword to defend myself: but 1 could not use it

</p>
<p>very expert, as I had not used any arms for a long
</p>
<p>time.'" Thistlewood said, there was no one who
</p>
<p>was worth 10/. who was worth any thing for the
</p>
<p>good of his country. As to the sliopkeepers of
</p>
<p>London, they were all a set of aristocrats toge-
</p>
<p>ther, and were all working under the same system

</p>
<p>of government. He should glory to see the day
</p>
<p>that all the shops were shut up, and well plun-
</p>
<p>dered. He then alluded to Mr. Hunt, and said,
</p>
<p>he (Hunt) was a d d coward, and were he
</p>
<p>(Thistlewood) to go to Whitehall, he was sure he
</p>
<p>would find his (Hunt's) name there, as a spy to
</p>
<p>Sfovernment. He then turned the conversation to
</p>
<p>Cobbett, and said, he was equally the same as
</p>
<p>Hunt, and for all his writings, he had no doubt he
</p>
<p>was also a spy. This ended the conversation
</p>
<p>then. I was afterwards confined for debt in
</p>
<p>Whitecross-street Prison. The next interview I
</p>
<p>had with Thistlewood was on the IGth, at the
</p>
<p>White Hart public-house. It was in a room in
</p>
<p>the back yard. Thistlewood was present, and
</p>
<p>Ings, Brunt, and Hall, and before they broke up,
</p>
<p>Tidd. On the 17th I w^ent to prison, and remained
</p>
<p>fourteen days there.. I came out on Sunday, the
</p>
<p>day after the death of the King. I saw Thistle-
</p>
<p>wood on the Monday evening following. I saw
</p>
<p>him in the same floor in the house where Brunt
</p>
<p>lived, in a back room. This was in Fox-court,
</p>
<p>Gray's Inn-lane. There were Brunt, Ings, Hall,
</p>
<p>and Davidson, present. There was nothing parti-
</p>
<p>cular took place that night. To the best of my
</p>
<p>recollection, 1 met them next on the Wednesday,
</p>
<p>(by them he meant Thistlewood, Brunt, Davidson,
</p>
<p>Harrison, and Ings,) 1 had a conversation 
</p>
<p>Mr. Curwood here objected to the witness
</p>
<p>speaking to wdiat then occurred, as no over-act
</p>
<p>was set forth in the indictment on that day. It
</p>
<p>merely referred to a meeting on the 16th, and at
</p>
<p>divers other times.
</p>
<p>Lord Chief- Justice Abbott observed, that the

</p>
<p>present mode was the invariable form of such in-
</p>
<p>dictments, and no objection was ever made to it.
</p>
<p>If all the particulars of overt-acts were set forth,
</p>
<p>it would occasion a great prolixity.  Tlie ob-
</p>
<p>jection was over-ruled.
</p>
<p>Witness continued  I went into the room and
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF TlflSlI.r.WOOD. 145
</p>
<p>saw a number of pike staves, and Thistlewood
</p>
<p>wanted to have them ferruled. Thistlewood then
</p>
<p>asked why Bradburn (the ]n-isoner) was not pre-
</p>
<p>sent, and he added that Bradburn was intrusted
</p>
<p>with money to purchase ferrules, and was not sa-
</p>
<p>tisfied lest he should not buy them. The staves
</p>
<p>were green, and seemed as if they had just come
</p>
<p>from the country. Thistlewood said he would
</p>
<p>not give a damn for a man who would spend the
</p>
<p>money in such a way. 1 do not recollect anv
</p>
<p>thing further then. The meetings were held
</p>
<p>twice a-day from thence to the 23d of February.
</p>
<p>The room was hired by Brunt for Ings ; Brunt
</p>
<p>said so. I remember one circumstance that oc-
</p>
<p>curred : one evening, about ten days before the
</p>
<p>Cato-street business, I went in and saw Harrison,
</p>
<p>Thistlewood, and Brunt. Harrison said, he had
</p>
<p>been speaking to one of the horse-guards, and he
</p>
<p>told him, that the whole of them ^\'ould be down
</p>
<p>at Windsor at the King's funeral ; and Harrison
</p>
<p>said, this woiild be a good o])})orlunity to do some-
</p>
<p>thing that night (the night of the funeral.) This-
</p>
<p>tlewood said it was a good place, and added,
</p>
<p>that if they could get the two pieces of cannon
</p>
<p>in Gray's Inn-lane, and the six pieces in the
</p>
<p>Artillery-ground, they could so help themselves
</p>
<p>as to have possession of London before morning;
</p>
<p>and he said, that when the news should reach
</p>
<p>Windsor, the soldiers would be so tired as not to
</p>
<p>be able, when they came back to London, to do
</p>
<p>any thuig ; but that by activity some might go to
</p>
<p>Hyde-park, and prevent any person or messenger
</p>
<p>from going to Windsor. He also said, that they
</p>
<p>should go over the water and take the telegraph,

<p>to prevent any communication wdth Woolwich,
</p>
<p>He then said that they should iorm a Pro-
</p>
<p>visional Government, and send to the sea-ports,
</p>
<p>to prevent any gentlemen from leaving England
</p>
<p>without passports. He particularly mentioned
</p>
<p>to send to Dover, Brighton, Margate, and Rams-
</p>

</p>
<p>146 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACr.
</p>
<p>gate, and he most particularly mentioned Brighton
</p>
<p> not that he thought the .new King would be
</p>
<p>there, or at the funeral. He said the present
</p>
<p>family had inherited the throne long enough, and
</p>
<p>it was no use for the present King to think of
</p>
<p>being crowned. Brunt and Ings came in after
</p>
<p>this, and Thistlewood mentioned to them what
</p>
<p>passed ; but they said that nothing would satisfy
</p>
<p>them but their plan of assassination. They had
</p>
<p>talked at a former meeting of this plan of assas-
</p>
<p>sination. Two or three of them had drawn out a
</p>
<p>plan of assassinating his Majesty's Ministers at
</p>
<p>the first public dinner they had. They talked of
</p>
<p>assassination at every one of their meetings. I
</p>
<p>could not say there were pikes in the room be-
</p>
<p>fore this. I met them on Saturday, the l9th of
</p>
<p>February, at eleven or twelve in the forenoon.
</p>
<p>I saw Thistlewood, Davidson, Brunt, Harrison,
</p>
<p>Ings, and Hall. They were all set round the
</p>
<p>fire, and seemed in a conversation betwixt them-
</p>
<p>selves. They all got up and turned round, and
</p>
<p>said, *' It is agreed, if nothing turns out before
</p>
<p>next Wednesday night, next Wednesday we will
</p>
<p>go to work.^' It was said they were all sworn
</p>
<p>that they would not wait any longer.
</p>
<p>Thistlewood proposed they should meet the
</p>
<p>following morning at nine, to draw out a plan
</p>
<p>to go by. Thistlewood said to Brunt, " You had
</p>
<p>better go round this afternoon and mention it, in
</p>
<p>order to have the committee to-morrow." Brunt
</p>
<p>said, he did not think he should be able to go, as
</p>
<p>he had some work to do, but he would go on the
</p>
<p>next morning, and perhaps he might see some of
</p>
<p>them : it was not necessary to bring a great

</p>
<p>many. Brunt appeared to be leaving the room
</p>
<p>then, and Thistlewood called to him, and said 
</p>
<p>** O, Brunt, it will be highly necessary for those
</p>
<p>that come to-morrow morning to bring fire-arms
</p>
<p>with them, in case any officers should come up."
</p>
<p>On which Brunt said, " D  n my eyes, if ^\iv

</p>
<p>officer should come in here, the time is so near
</p>
<p>now, I would run him through the body. I
</p>
<p>would murder him here sooner than we should
</p>
<p>be discovered."
</p>
<p>On the next morning I went there about eleven
</p>
<p>o'clock. It was a little dark in my eyes when I
</p>
<p>went in after the snow. There were Thistlewood,
</p>
<p>Brunt, Harrison, Cooke, Bradburn, Tidd, Ed-
</p>
<p>wards, and Wilson, myself, and another. William
</p>
<p>Cooke, on looking round the room, said, '* There
</p>
<p>are twelve in the room, and I think it enough to
</p>
<p>form a committee." Thistlewood proposed that
</p>
<p>Tidd should take the chair. Tidd took the chair,
</p>
<p>and. sat with a pike in his hand. Thistlewood
</p>
<p>was on his right and -Brunt on his left. This-
</p>
<p>tlewood said, " Gentlemen, you all know what
</p>
<p>we are met for ;" and then he turned to the door,
</p>
<p>as if unwilling to mention it, and said, " the west-
</p>
<p>end job." Brunt then said, " D  n my eyes,
</p>
<p>name it." On which Thistlewood again said,
</p>
<p>*' Gentlemen, we are come to the determination
</p>
<p>to do this job, that we were talking about so long,
</p>
<p>and as we find there is no probability of meeting
</p>
<p>them (Ministers) altogether, we shall, if no
</p>
<p>opportunity of doing them altogether occurs, take
</p>
<p>them separately, at their own houses, and do as
</p>
<p>many as we can. If we can only get three or
</p>
<p>four at a time we must do them." He also said,
</p>
<p>*' I suppose we can take forty or fifty men to do this
</p>
<p>west-end job ; and I propose to take the two
</p>
<p>pieces of cannon in Gray's Inn-lane, and the six
</p>
<p>pieces in the Artillery-ground." He proposed
</p>
<p>Cooke to lead this party, and he himself would
</p>
<p>command. He said they should take the

<p>148 CA'IO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>This was the principal part; of the plan, but if
</p>
<p>any thing else occurred before Wednesday, they
</p>
<p>would think of it. Brunt was then going to put
</p>
<p>a proposition which he had for assassinating the
</p>
<p>Ministers, but Thistlewood said, his plan should
</p>
<p>be first put from the chair, as they were nearly
</p>
<p>all agreed on it. He desired the chairman to ask
</p>
<p>if any of them had any thing to say, and that
</p>
<p>they should say it ; but none of them saying any
</p>
<p>thing, the plan was carried unanimously. Brunt
</p>
<p>then came forward with his plan, which was, that
</p>
<p>they should assassinate as many of his Majesty's
</p>
<p>Ministers as possible ; that they should draw
</p>
<p>lots to assassinate some of the Ministers ; and
</p>
<p>whoever the fellow was on whom the lot fell, he
</p>
<p>should murder the Minister, or be murdered
</p>
<p>himself; and that if any man failed in the at-
</p>
<p>tempt, he (Brunt) swore by all that was good, he
</p>
<p>should be run through the body. On which I
</p>
<p>got up, and said, " Mr. Brunt, do you not think
</p>
<p>it possible for a man to attempt such a thing, and
</p>
<p>not succeed in it ; and do you mean to say he
</p>
<p>should be run through the body for not doing it ?"
</p>
<p>To which he said, "I do not : if a man should
</p>
<p>attempt it and not succeed, he is a good man ;
</p>
<p>but if he shews any cowardice, he deserves to
</p>
<p>be run through the body." This proposition of
</p>
<p>Brunt's was then put to the meeting.
</p>
<p>Soon after this, Palin, Potter, and Strange, came
</p>
<p>in. They were welcomed, and were desired to
</p>
<p>sit near the fire, as they were wet. Palin said,
</p>
<p>** There is one thing I want to know ; if it can
</p>
<p>be done, it will be a great assistance to our plan.
</p>
<p>I want to know what men are to perform each

<p>part of the plan, and who are to take the cannon.
</p>
<p>I want to know, in calling upon the men, whether
</p>
<p>I can tell them in part or whole what is to be
</p>
<p>done." The chairman said, " I don't see where
</p>
<p>the harm is of telling what is to be done.'' Mr.
</p>
<p>THIAI. OF THISTJ.EWOOD. 149
</p>
<p>Palin, seeing that he had that liberty, sat down
</p>
<p>quite satisfied. Nothing regular was transacted
</p>
<p>in the chair after that. Mr. Thistlewood said,
</p>
<p>" O, Brunt, that is well thought of, as Palin is
</p>
<p>here : you and Palin go, and see if the house near
</p>
<p>FurnivaFs Inn is fit for setting fire to. They
</p>
<p>went (Palin and Brunt), and reported it would
</p>
<p>make a d d good fire. Thistlewood talked of
</p>
<p>getting means for a treat on Tuesday and Wed-
</p>
<p>nesday. Brunt said, he would be d d, but he
</p>
<p>would contribute the only 1/. note he had earned
</p>
<p>for a long time. They proposed the White- Hart
</p>
<p>for the house. Thistlewood proposed his own
</p>
<p>room ; but afterwards thought it would not do, as
</p>
<p>it might lead to suspicion. This was all on the
</p>
<p>Sunday morning. On Monday morning they met
</p>
<p>again. Witness then told them what llobbes told
</p>
<p>him on Sunday night, of inquiries made respect-
</p>
<p>ing radical meetings at his liouse, and that
</p>
<p>information of it was given at Bow-street office,
</p>
<p>and at Lord Sidmouth's office. Harrison turned
</p>
<p>round on witness like a lion, and said " Adams,
</p>
<p>you have acted d d wrong." Brunt said so
</p>
<p>too, and added, *' Whatever you have to commu-
</p>
<p>nicate, you have no business to communicate but
</p>
<p>to me and to Thistlewood." Witness said, it
</p>
<p>concerned all, and he should tell all of it. They
</p>
<p>repeated the same observations. They talked of
</p>
<p>calling a meeting of the Mary-le-bone Union, as
</p>
<p>they wanted some money ; and Brunt said, it
</p>
<p>would be of use for that purpose.
</p>
<p>Witness and Potter went in the evening to the
</p>
<p>White-Hart ; Palin and Bradburn joined them.
</p>
<p>Next morning they were there too, and with them

</p>
<p>Thistlewood, Tidd, Ings, Harrison, and Brunt.
</p>
<p>Edwards came, and told them there was to be
</p>
<p>a cabinet dinner next night. Thistlewood said,
</p>
<p>he did not think it was true. A newspaper was
</p>
<p>sent for, and read by Thistlewood. He read that
</p>
<p>they were to dine at T.ord Harrowby's, Grosvenor-
</p>
<p>150 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>square. Brunt then said, " I'll be d    d if I
</p>
<p>don't believe there is a God, I have often prayed
</p>
<p>that he would bring all these thieves together, in
</p>
<p>order to destroy them. He has answered my
</p>
<p>prayer." Thistlewood proposed, that they should
</p>
<p>form a committee and sit immediately. Witness
</p>
<p>took the chair. "
</p>
<p>Thistlewood proposed immediately a fresh plan
</p>
<p>to be formed respecting the assassination. Wit-
</p>
<p>ness expressed a hope they had paid due con-
</p>
<p>sideration to what he said yesterday. All got
</p>
<p>into confusion. Harrison said, " D  n that man
</p>
<p>who attempted to throw cold water on the plan,
</p>
<p>but he would run him through with the sword."
</p>
<p>Witness left the chair, and Tidd took it. Brunt
</p>
<p>moved that a watch should be set on the Earl of
</p>
<p>Harrowby^s house that night. The object was to
</p>
<p>see if any men or soldiers went into Earl Har-
</p>
<p>rowby's. Two were to go at six, to be relieved
</p>
<p>at nine, and they were to continue till twelve.
</p>
<p>The watch was to be resumed at four next
</p>
<p>morning.
</p>
<p>Thistlewood said he hoped they would be sa-
</p>
<p>tisfied that no officers or soldiers went in. They
</p>
<p>would do what they had determined to-morrow
</p>
<p>evening; and added, that it would answer their
</p>
<p>purpose much better than to attack their houses
</p>
<p>separately, when only two or three could be got
</p>
<p>together. Here they would have fourteen or
</p>
<p>sixteen ; a rare haul to murder them all. " I pro-
</p>
<p>pose," continued he, ** when the door is opened,
</p>
<p>to rush in, seize the servants, present pistols, and
</p>
<p>threaten to kill them if they make any noise ;
</p>
<p>two to take the entrance to the stair upwards,

</p>
<p>and two others to the stair to the lower part of
</p>
<p>the house, armed with blunderbusses and hand-
</p>
<p>grenades ; and if any attempt to pass, to throw
</p>
<p>hand-grenades and destroy them all. Others are
</p>
<p>to go where the ministers are to murder them all.
</p>
<p>If there shall be any good men, kill them for

</p>
<p>keeping bad company." All agreed. Ings said,
</p>
<p>he would go in first, with a brace of pistols and
</p>
<p>knives. The two swordsmen would cut oif all their
</p>
<p>heads ; and Castlereagh's and Sidmouth's should
</p>
<p>be flung in a bag by themselves. He added, " I
</p>
<p>shall say, my Lords, I have got as good men here
</p>
<p>as the Manchester yeomanry; enter citizens, and
</p>
<p>do your duty." Harrison and witness were to be
</p>
<p>the swordsmen. After the execution of Lord
</p>
<p>Harrowby, at his house, Harrison proposed that
</p>
<p>some should go to King-street horsje-barracks, and
</p>
<p>set fire to the premises by throwing fire into the
</p>
<p>straw in the stable.
</p>
<p>Harrison and Wilson were to go to Gray's Inn-
</p>
<p>lane, and, in case they could not carry the cannon
</p>
<p>out of the military-school, they were to wait till a
</p>
<p>party came to assist them. Thence they were to
</p>
<p>proceed to the artillery barracks, to assist Cooke
</p>
<p>in taking the cannon there. If they found their
</p>
<p>strength sufficient to proceed, they were to ad-
</p>
<p>vance to the Mansion-house, and plant three of
</p>
<p>the cannon on each side of the Mansion-house,
</p>
<p>and to demand the Mansion-house. If it were
</p>
<p>refused, they were to fire, and then it would be
</p>
<p>given up. The Mansion-house was to be made
</p>
<p>the seat for the Provisional Government.
</p>
<p>The Bank of England was next to be taken.
</p>
<p>They would take the books, which would enable
</p>
<p>them to see further into the villany of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment. The further parts of the plan were delayed
</p>
<p>till Wednesday. They agreed upon a sign and
</p>
<p>countersign. The word was " Button;" the man
</p>
<p>who came up was to say B-u-t ; and the other
</p>
<p>was to reply t-o-n.  Being asked as to the watch,

<p>witness said, There are other things which I wish
</p>
<p>to state. I went there next morning, and found
</p>
<p>Edwards, Ings, and Hall, making fusees for the
</p>
<p>hand-grenades. Davidson went on the watch at
</p>
<p>six. Witness and Brunt went to relieve the
</p>
<p>watch. They saw Davidson in the square, on the
</p>
<p>152 CATO-STREET CONSPIHACY,
</p>
<p>watch. They went into a public-house, where
</p>
<p>Brunt played at dominos with a young man.
</p>
<p>About eleven they went out into the square,
</p>
<p>and walked for some time, till witness got ashamed
</p>
<p>of himself. They went away at twelve o'clock.
</p>
<p>He went next day to Fox-court, between two and
</p>
<p>three. He found Brunt there. Strange came in,
</p>
<p>and in a f 5w minutes afterwards two more stran-
</p>
<p>gers. Strange and another were trying the flints.
</p>
<p>They went into a back room to avoid the strangers,
</p>
<p>where witness saw cutlasses, blunderbusses, &c.
</p>
<p>Thistlewood, Ings, and Hall came in. Thistle-
</p>
<p>wood said, " Well, my lads, this looks like some-
</p>
<p>thing to be done." He touched witness on the
</p>
<p>shoulder, and asked how he was. Witness replied
</p>
<p>that he was very unwell, and in low spirits.
</p>
<p>Thistlewood sent for beer and gin. Thistlewood
</p>
<p>then wanted some paper to write bills on. Wit-
</p>
<p>ness said, cartridge paper would do. The paper
</p>
<p>was brought ; and table and chair were got. The
</p>
<p>bills were then written ; they were to be set on
</p>
<p>the houses, to let the people know v/hat had been
</p>
<p>done. Thistlewood read as part, " Your tyrants
</p>
<p>are destroyed  the friends of liberty are called
</p>
<p>upon to come forvvard  the Provisional Govern-
</p>
<p>ment is now sitting. James logs, Secretary.
</p>
<p>February 28.'' Thistlewood was much agitated,
</p>
<p>and could Vv'rite only three. Another bill was
</p>
<p>written, which was an address to the soldiers.
</p>
<p>Another person was employed to write it, and
</p>
<p>Thistlewood dictated to him.  Witness said he
</p>
<p>would tell what he had seen.
</p>
<p>Mr. Adolphus objected to this, and contended,
</p>
<p>that the writing alone was evidence.

</p>
<p>Witness could not say what became of the
</p>
<p>papers, and he had not seen them since.
</p>
<p>Mr. Solicitor-General now stated, that notice
</p>
<p>had been given to produce the writings.
</p>
<p>Witness said that this second kind of bill was not
</p>
<p>finished,  thev could not ao^ree as to the terms.

<p>"Sir. Adolphus renewed his (j])jection to the
</p>
<p>question what Thistlewod dictated to be written.
</p>
<p>Lord Chiel'-Juslice Abbot.  In whose hands
</p>
<p>had you hist seen the paper ?
</p>
<p>Witness did not know him.
</p>
<p>His Lordship said, some doubts were enter-
</p>
<p>tained by some [)art of the Court.
</p>
<p>I\Ir. SoHcitor-General said, he would not
</p>
<p>press it.
</p>
<p>Witness went on.  Ings liad two black belts on,
</p>
<p>one lor two pistols, the other ibr cutlasses. lie
</p>
<p>had two bags on his shoulders, like soldiers haver-
</p>
<p>sacks. He looked at himself and said, he was
</p>
<p>not complete yet, he had forgot his steel. He took
</p>
<p>out a large knife, and brandished it about, and
</p>
<p>said, it would cut off the heads of Castleroagh
</p>
<p>and Sidmouth, and it \vould be thought a great
</p>
<p>deal of at some future time. The knife was a
</p>
<p>large bnmd knife, twelve inches long, the hand
</p>
<p>bound round with wax to keep a tirni hold of it.
</p>
<p>Others were busy at other arms. They began to
</p>
<p>leave the room about half-past four or five, to go
</p>
<p>about the business.
</p>
<p>Pahn came in half an hour before. Palin said
</p>
<p>they ought to be aware of what they w^ere about,
</p>
<p>and to think within themselves whether they were
</p>
<p>to do their country service or not, and whether
</p>
<p>the assassmatic/U would be countenanced by their
</p>
<p>country. If they thought their country would
</p>
<p>join them, then the man who liinched should be
</p>
<p>run through on the spot. Unless they came to
</p>
<p>this determination they would do no good. A tall
</p>
<p>man came in, and asked what the business thev
</p>
<p>were about was. Witness had never seen him

</p>
<p>before. The tall man said, if they were to serve
</p>
<p>their country, he was their man, and if any one
</p>
<p>was afraid of his life, he ought to have nothing to
</p>
<p>do with such a concern as that. Thistlewood was
</p>
<p>then gone. Brunt was told, that inquiries were
</p>
<p>made by some who were present, as to the j)kui
</p>
<p>X
</p>
<p>154 CATO-STUEF.T CO^S^lRAC\^
</p>
<p>they were about, Brunt said, that was not the
</p>
<p>room for telling that ; but they should go with
</p>
<p>him, and they would know. Brunt promised
</p>
<p>spirits ; and the tall man cautioned against drun-
</p>
<p>kenness, as ruinous to a cause like that. They
</p>
<p>went along the street, two and two, and at some
</p>
<p>distance, that they might not be observed. There
</p>
<p>was a cupboard in the room used for swords,
</p>
<p>hand-grenades, and flannel bags for cartridges,
</p>
<p>one of which was full. The rest of the arms were
</p>
<p>in Tidd's room; that was the dep6t. Thistlewood
</p>
<p>was always in a hurry to carry every thing that
</p>
<p>was got ready into the depot, lest any officer
</p>
<p>should see it. Witness carried a brass-barrelled
</p>
<p>blunderbuss. There were pikes made of old files.
</p>
<p>Witness as he went on missed all his associates.
</p>
<p>He returned back, and met Brunt, who returned
</p>
<p>back with him along the Edge ware-road, till they
</p>
<p>met Thistlewood.
</p>
<p>They went altogether to the stable in Cato-
</p>
<p>street. Witness stayed behind till Harrison came
</p>
<p>up, and made him go in. He saw there, David-
</p>
<p>son and Wilson below, Thistlewood, Ings, Hall,
</p>
<p>Bradburn, Strange, Cooper, the tall man, and
</p>
<p>others above. There were, as Thistlewood calcu-
</p>
<p>lated, at last, eighteen above and two below.
</p>
<p>There was a bench above and arms on it. Some
</p>
<p>beer was standing on the table. There were lights.
</p>
<p>There was a chest. Before Tidd came, Thistle-
</p>
<p>wood went out for some time. Witness heard a
</p>
<p>deal of talk below, and he found Thistlewood,
</p>
<p>Brunt, Harrison, Davidson, and Wilson. They
</p>
<p>spoke of the good news, they heard that the
</p>
<p>carriages were arriving at Lord Harrowby's as

</p>
<p>fast as they could. Witnefcs went up to the^loft,
</p>
<p>and saw Thistlewood and Brunt nmch agitated.
</p>
<p>They spoke of Tidd's absence. Brunt pledged
</p>
<p>his word that he would come. He soon after-
</p>
<p>wards came. Thistlewood said, " I hope you
</p>
<p>will not give up what you are going to do ; if you
</p>
<p>TRiAr. (F riiisTLEWooi). lo5
</p>
<p>do, this will be another Despard's business." He
</p>
<p>then counted twenty ])ersons, and said that was
</p>
<p>enough, fourteen would be sufficient to go into
</p>
<p>the room, and the other six would take care of
</p>
<p>the servants and doors. They then set apart
</p>
<p>fourteen.
</p>
<p>The gin bottle was then started. Thistlewood
</p>
<p>said, if Lord Harrowby had sixteen servants, that
</p>
<p>was nothing, as they would not be prepared. A
</p>
<p>noise was heard below. Thistlewood took a
</p>
<p>candle and looked down to see who they were,
</p>
<p>and then set down the candle quite confused, ac-
</p>
<p>cording to witness's judgment. Two officers took
</p>
<p>command of the room, holding small pistols, and
</p>
<p>said, " A pretty nest there is of you. We have
</p>
<p>got a warrant to apprehend you all, and hope you
</p>
<p>will go peaceably.'^ A man who was on the step
</p>
<p>of the ladder said, "Let me come forward." This
</p>
<p>was the man murdered. A group of persons had
</p>
<p>got into the little room, and then came forward,
</p>
<p>and one of them stretched forward an arm, wit-
</p>
<p>ness saw nothing in it, and another presented a
</p>
<p>pistol. The man fell. It was impossible for him
</p>
<p>to give a particular account of the other transac-
</p>
<p>tions. He got away, went home, and was appre-
</p>
<p>hended on the Friday, and remained in custody
</p>
<p>since. He identified Davidson, Wilson, Brunt,
</p>
<p>Ings, Cooper, Harrison, Tidd. There were two
</p>
<p>he did not know. They were again called for-
</p>
<p>ward, but he said he could not swear to them.
</p>
<p>He was sent forward near the dock : but he said
</p>
<p>he did not know them. One of them, he said, he
</p>
<p>saw at the meeting.

<p>not there to assassinate his jVLijesty's Ministers.
</p>
<p>His legs carried him there. His outward intent
</p>
<p>to all ap])carancc was for that ; but his inward
</p>
<p>intent was against it. He was kept to it, because
</p>
<p>13runt said, whoever forsook them would be

<p>Cambray, in 181C. He had been a soldier years
</p>
<p>before. He was a shoemaker. He had never
</p>
<p>been treasurer to a benefit society. He carried
</p>
<p>with him 40/. He thought the money his own.
</p>
<p>He had never been charged with steahng it. He
</p>
<p>was introduced to Thistlewood by his friend

<p>Brunt, to assassinate his Majesty's Ministers.
</p>
<p>That was the first object. He first gave infor-
</p>
<p>mation on the Saturday after. It was indeed
</p>
<p>from compunction. " ]\iy motive was, gentle-
</p>
<p>men of the Jury, I do assure you, that I made a
</p>
<p>vow to God that I should tell the whole truth. I
</p>
<p>did indeed regard it Avitli horror. I felt com-
</p>
<p>punctious visitings before I was in custody. It was
</p>
<p>not because I felt my neck in danger, or because I
</p>
<p>tlioui'lit it was better eighteen should be hanged
</p>
<p>thcui myself." The greatest number he ever saw
</p>
<p>present was fifteen men. The greatest sum he
</p>
<p>sav/ was sixpence. There was no collection of
</p>
<p>halfpence and pence for the newspaper. Tidd's
</p>
<p>was the depot. He saw no muster-roll, and no
</p>
<p>cannon-ball. The cannon were to be charged
</p>
<p>with cartridges, and a large hammer was to be
</p>
<p>l)ought to strike down the tops of the iron pa-
</p>
<p>lisades, as it was thought they would do more
</p>
<p>execution than balls. The newspaper was " The
</p>
<p>New Times." Witness did not know whether it
</p>
<p>was correct. He had seen nothing of Edwards
</p>
<p>since. He was employed to carry a sword, as
</p>
<p>being expert at it. He was not sufficiently near
</p>
<p>to have killed the man in the loft with the sword.
</p>
<p>His hand was not extended. He could tell no-
</p>
<p>thing of the proceedings that followed. He went
</p>
<p>away, and did not deliver himself up, because

<p>1 am servant to Henry Rogers : he lives at No. 4,

<p>Fox-court, Gray"s-Inn-lane. We had a lodger

<p>Aviis a moiith or five weeks before Brunt was
</p>
<p>taken up. He (Brunt) said the lodger lately
</p>
<p>caiuc from the country, and he wanted a room;
</p>
<p>and as we had one to let, he wished him to have
</p>
<p>it. The room was unfurnislied. He paid three
</p>
<p>shillings a week ibr it. He (the lodger) said he
</p>
<p>might not bring his goods in for a week or better.
</p>
<p>He never brought any in to my knowledge. 1 do

<p>not think I should know him again. 1 do not

</p>
<p>He paid me for four or five weeks. I cannot say
</p>
<p>whether he ever slept there; he did not to my
</p>
<p>knowledge. I and my maid in the evening saw
</p>
<p>three men coming up stairs. The one in the
</p>
<p>middle was a black man. The light from my
</p>
<p>room was on their faces. At other times 1
</p>
<p>heard persons going up stairs, but took no par-
</p>
<p>ticular notice.
</p>
<p>This witness was not cross-examined.
</p>
<p>Joseph Hale, a young lad, the apprentice of
</p>
<p>Brunt, examined by Mr. Gurney.  I am ap-
</p>
<p>])rentice to Brunt. I have served two years and
</p>
<p>iDctter of my apprenticeship. I lived with him
</p>
<p>in Fox-court. I remember a person coming to
</p>
<p>lodge there in January. His name was Ings, a
</p>
<p>butcher. Brunt and he looked at the room.
</p>
<p>Brunt said, " It will do ; go down and give them a
</p>
<p>shilling." After that Ings used to come to the
</p>
<p>room. The key was mostly left in the front
</p>
<p>room, and Ings used to come there for it. Per-
</p>
<p>sons used sometimes to come to the room before
</p>
<p>my master was taken up. This was every evening.
</p>
<p>r saw different persons. They were Ings, Tidd,
</p>
<p>Thistlewood, Bradburn, Edwards, Hall, Potter,
</p>
<p>and Strange. I remember a man named Adams:
</p>
<p>he came. Davidson, the black man, came also.
</p>
<p>Others used to come, but I do not recollect them.
</p>
<p>They used to stay nearly about two hours. There
</p>
<p>was no furniture in the room that ever I saw.
</p>
<p>They used to take chairs in, out of the front
</p>
<p>room. I did not hear any of their conver-
</p>
<p>sation. They used to call Thistlewood some-

<p>times T., his initial, and sometimes Arthur. I
</p>
<p>once saw the door of Ings's room open, and
</p>
<p>saw some long poles, like branches of trees cut
</p>
<p>rough ; I suppose about twenty of them. I
</p>
<p>sometimes heard hammering and sawing in the
</p>
<p>room. My master was taken on Thursdav, the

<p>TRIAL OF THfSTI.EAVOOD. 1 .')9
</p>
<p>24th of February. On the Sunday before that
</p>
<p>tliere was a meeting in the room. There were
</p>
<p>more tlmt morning than ever I had seen come up
</p>
<p>betbre. All the persons whom I have named
</p>
<p>were there that mornini-. After the meetin^: broke
</p>
<p>up I saw Strange in my master's room. There
</p>
<p>was no meeting on the Monday evening. There
</p>
<p>was no meeting on Tuesday. On the Wednesday
</p>
<p>thc-re were several persons going in and out.
</p>
<p>Some of them came into the front room, where I
</p>
<p>worked. They got some pistols, and were putting
</p>
<p>new ilints in them. There were five or six pistols.
</p>
<p>One of the men said there were people overlooking
</p>
<p>them from the next house, and Brunt told them to
</p>
<p>go to the back room. Strange and a man whom
</p>
<p>1 did not know were the men wdio had the pistols.
</p>
<p>I cannot say how many I saw go in and out. I
</p>
<p>saw Tliistlewood that day. In the afternoon he
</p>
<p>asked me for a sheet of writing-paper. I gave
</p>
<p>him one. He took it, I believe, into the back
</p>
<p>room.
</p>
<p>My master after this came out of the back
</p>
<p>room, and desired me to get six sheets of cartridge
</p>
<p>paper. He gave me sixpence. I bought tlie
</p>
<p>paper and gave it to him, and he took it into the
</p>
<p>back room. This was about four or five in the
</p>
<p>afternoon. I heard people going dow^n stairs
</p>
<p>between five and six. My master w-as in and out
</p>
<p>several times. He went away finally about six.
</p>
<p>There was a man went with him. It was not oiie
</p>
<p>of the men I used to see there. A table had been
</p>
<p>taken that day from my mistress's room to the back
</p>
<p>room. I v/antod the table, and went for it. I
</p>
<p>knocked at the door, and Potter o])ened it. There

</p>
<p>were four or five in the room besides Potter.
</p>
<p>After my master was gone, I saw Tidd between
</p>
<p>seven and eight. Mrs. Brunt called him, and he
</p>
<p>came into her room. She showed him a pike-
</p>
<p>head and a sword. She asked him what she
</p>
<p>should do with them. She then gave them to
</p>
<p>IGO CATO-STREET CONSPIFIACY
</p>
<p>liim, and he took them out of the room into the
</p>
<p>back room. After this I heard some persons go
</p>
<p>down stairs. Tidd left a message, that if any
</p>
<p>persons called they should be sent to the White
</p>
<p>Hart. Some persons did call on my master, and
</p>
<p>I went to show them to the White Hart. Potter
</p>
<p>came, and he went. He knew the way himself.
</p>
<p>There were three came to whom I shewed the
</p>
<p>way.
</p>
<p>My master came home that night at about
</p>
<p>nine o'clock. I observed his dress was dirty.
</p>
<p>He appeared confused. I heard him say to his
</p>
<p>wife, it was all up, or words to that effect. He
</p>
<p>said that where he had been, a great many officers
</p>
<p>had come in. He said he had saved his life, and
</p>
<p>that was all. Just as he said this, another man
</p>
<p>came in. I do not know that man. Brunt shook
</p>
<p>hands with him, and asked him if he knew who
</p>
<p>had informed. The man said, no. The man then
</p>
<p>said, he had had a dreadful blow on the side,
</p>
<p>which knocked him down. Brunt then said,
</p>
<p>" There is something to be done yet.'^ After this
</p>
<p>Brunt and the other man went away together.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Brunt and I after this went to lno-s"s room.
</p>
<p>I saw several rolls of brown paper with tar in
</p>
<p>them. I saw only one pole remaining. I saw
</p>
<p>something rolled up, and tied round with strings,
</p>
<p>I understood them to be hand-grenades. I saw
</p>
<p>an iron pot belonging to Brunt. My master came
</p>
<p>in about eleven o'clock. He told me to get up in
</p>
<p>the morning as soon as I could and clean his
</p>
<p>boots. They were very dirty. He called me in
</p>
<p>the morning at half past six, and when [ got up
</p>
<p>he asked me if I knew the Borough. I told him

</p>
<p>yes. He then asked if I knew Snow's-fields. 1
</p>
<p>said no. He then went into the back room and
</p>
<p>put the things out of the cupboard into two
</p>
<p>baskets ; one of which was afterwards put into a
</p>
<p>blue apron belonging to Mrs. Brunt. This apron
</p>
<p>had before this been as a curtain in Ings's room.

<p>TRIAL OF TIII<^TLE^VOOD. IGl
</p>
<p>My master told me that Potter lived in Snow's
</p>
<p>fields. When we had the baskets ready, two
</p>
<p>officers came in and took my master into custody.
</p>
<p>I knew M'liere Tidd lived. lie lived in the Hole-
</p>
<p>in-the-Wall-passage, Brooks'-market. Adams lived
</p>
<p>next door.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus.  My master
</p>
<p>is a journeyman shoemaker : not a very poor man.
</p>
<p>Adams is also a shoemaker. Ings had the lodg-
</p>
<p>ings five weeks. I believe they had meetings
</p>
<p>there every night. I thought there were about
</p>
<p>twenty persons there on the Sunday. I know
</p>
<p>some of the prisoners. Strange is a boot-seller 
</p>
<p>selling boots in a shop. Edwards was an artist.
</p>
<p>Edwards v/as there very often : oftener than
</p>
<p>Adams  almost every day. Hall was a journey-
</p>
<p>man tailor, I believe. I don't know where he
</p>
<p>lives, I cannot say how many persons were there
</p>
<p>at one time on Wednesday. The baskets used
</p>
<p>by my master were rush baskets. As near as I
</p>
<p>can guess there were about twenty poles. They
</p>
<p>were branches of trees in a green raw state. I
</p>
<p>believe they kept a fire in Ings's room. I do not
</p>
<p>know whether the poles were cut up to light the
</p>
<p>fire or not.
</p>
<p>Thomas Smart examined bv Mr. Littledale. 
</p>
<p>I am a watchman of the parish of St. George,
</p>
<p>Hanover-square. I was on watch on the south
</p>
<p>side of Grosvenor-square, on Tuesday the 22d of
</p>
<p>February. I went tliere about eight o'clock.
</p>
<p>About half-past eight I saw four suspicious men
</p>
<p>walking the square. I thought they were after
</p>
<p>no good ; one of them was a dark man, and the
</p>
<p>other a tall man. I watched them. They were

<p>looking down the areas. Charles Bissix's box is
</p>
<p>at the west side of the square.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood.  It was not
</p>
<p>a very uncommon thing to see suspicious men
</p>
<p>walking about.

<p>Henry Gillax examined by Mr. I^olland.  I

</p>
<p>am a servant to Mr. Whittle, apothecary, at 15,

<p>Mount-street, Grosvenor-square. I sometimes
</p>
<p>use the Rising-sun public-house. It is in Charles-
</p>
<p>street, which runs into Grosvenor-square and
</p>
<p>Mount-street. I was there on Tuesday the 22d
</p>
<p>of February. I saw that short man (pointing to
</p>
<p>the prisoner Brunt) there. There was a tall man
</p>
<p>with him. They had some bread and cheese and
</p>
<p>porter. There were dominos on the table, and
</p>
<p>the short man challenged me to play with him. I
</p>
<p>played two games with him, and left the house
</p>
<p>before ten, leaving them there.
</p>
<p>John Hector Morris examined by the Attor-
</p>
<p>ney-General.  I am a journeyman cutler to Mr. Un-
</p>
<p>derwood, in Drury-lane. I remember on Christ-
</p>
<p>mas-eve a man brought a sword to my master's
</p>
<p>shop. The man was habited like a butcher. He
</p>
<p>drew the sword from under his smock-frock,
</p>
<p>without a scabbard. He wished to have it ground
</p>
<p>sharp, particularly at the point. He said to put
</p>
<p>the name of Inns on it ; but I am hard of hearing,
</p>
<p>and it might be Ings. He called for it in a few
</p>
<p>days. In about a fortnight he brought another
</p>
<p>sword to have it sharpened in the same way. It
</p>
<p>was much longer than the other. [Here the
</p>
<p>witness identified the prisoner Ings as the man
</p>
<p>who brought the swords.] I should know the
</p>
<p>swords again.
</p>
<p>Edward Simpson examined by the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General.  I am a corporal major of the 2nd
</p>
<p>Regiment of Life-Guards. I know a person named
</p>
<p>Harrison. He was in the Guards. (Here he
</p>
<p>identified Harrison.) He was discharged in 1814.
</p>
<p>When I knew.him, he was in King-street barracks,

<p>Portman-square. He had an opportunity of know-
</p>
<p>ing them. Part of the barracks looked into
</p>
<p>Gloucester Mews. There was a loft with five
</p>
<p>windows looking into it. There was hay and
</p>
<p>straw in that loft ; the windows had been stopped
</p>
<p>up since the Cato-street business.

</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curvvood.  I don't
</p>
<p>know how many men are in Knightsbridge bar-
</p>
<p>racks ; they would hold about 300.
</p>
<p>James Adams examined by the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General.  I am a pawnbroker in Berwick-street.
</p>
<p>I know the prisoner Davidson from his having
</p>
<p>pledged things at my shop. He came on the 23d
</p>
<p>of February, in the morning, and took a brass-
</p>
<p>barrelled blunderbuss out of pledge.
</p>
<p>This witness was not cross-examined.
</p>
<p>Thomas Hydex examined by Mr. Gurney.  I
</p>
<p>am a cow-keeper. I was formerly a member of
</p>
<p>a shoemakers' club. I knew Wilson there. I saw
</p>
<p>him a few days before the 23d of February ; he
</p>
<p>met me in the street, and made a proposition to
</p>
<p>me. He asked me if I would be one of a party
</p>
<p>to destroy his Majesty's Ministers ; he said they
</p>
<p>were waiting for a cabinet dinner, and that all
</p>
<p>things were ready. He told me they had a sort
</p>
<p>of things which I never saw; they were called by
</p>
<p>the name of hand-grenades,  and, he said, he de-
</p>
<p>pended on me to be one. He said that Mr.
</p>
<p>Thistlewood would be glad to see me, if I would
</p>
<p>be one. He said, the use to be made of the hand-
</p>
<p>grenades was to be put under the table, at the
</p>
<p>cabinet dinner, with the fuse alight, and those
</p>
<p>who escaped were to be destroyed by the sword
</p>
<p>or some other weapon. He also said that fires
</p>
<p>were to be lighted, and the town to be kept in
</p>
<p>confusion for several days, till the thing became
</p>
<p>general. He named some houses. Lord Har-
</p>
<p>rowby's, Lord Castlereagii's, Lord Wellington's,
</p>
<p>Lord Sidmouth's, the Bishop of London's, and

<p>him I would make one. This was, I believe, four
</p>
<p>or five days before the Cato-street business. Be-
</p>
<p>fore that I went to Lord Harrowby's. I do not
</p>
<p>remember tlie day. I followed his Lordship in

</p>
<p>164 CATO-STUEET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>between four and five o'clock in the after-noon. I
</p>
<p>met him in Manchester-street, ]\lanchester-square.
</p>
<p>He said, " Hyden, you are the very man I wanted
</p>
<p>to see." I asked liira what there was going- to
</p>
<p>be; and he said, there was to be a cabinet dinner
</p>
<p>at Lord llarrowby's, Grosvenor-square. He told
</p>
<p>me I was to go to the Horse and Groom public-
</p>
<p>house, the corner of Cato-street. I was to go in
</p>
<p>there, or otherwise I was to wait at the corner
</p>
<p>until I was shoved into a stable close by. I asked
</p>
<p>him the hour, and he said about half past five or
</p>
<p>a quarter before six. 1 then asked him how
</p>
<p>many there were to be, and he said twenty or
</p>
<p>thirty. 1 asked him, was that all there was going
</p>
<p>to be ? and he said, there was to be another
</p>
<p>party in the Borough, another in Gray's Inn-lane,
</p>
<p>and another in Gee's-court, or in the city. He
</p>
<p>said, all Gee's-court were in it ; but they would
</p>
<p>not act till after the English began, as they had so
</p>
<p>often deceived them before. Gee's-court is iniia-
</p>
<p>bited by Irish. It is at the St. Giles's end of
</p>
<p>Oxford-street. He also said there v/as a gentle-
</p>
<p>man's servant supporting them with money ; and,
</p>
<p>if they would act on the subject, he would give

<p>them a great deal more. He asked me if I liad
</p>
<p>a gun ; and i said yes, but it was only a rubbishing
</p>
<p>one. He then said they would provide me with
</p>
<p>a gun, and something to work with. There were,
</p>
<p>he also said, two pieces of cannon in Gray's Inn-
</p>
<p>lane, which they could get by breaking in a small
</p>
<p>door. He said tlicre were four pieces of cannon
</p>
<p>in the Artillery Ground, and they could be very
</p>
<p>easily taken, by killing the sentinel. After they

<p>left Grosvenor-square, they were to meet near the

<p>Mansion-house. I was told to couic to my time,
</p>
<p>or the thing would be done before I came.
</p>
<p>I went to John-street that evening; it ^^as
</p>
<p>nearly seven o'clock. The entrance to Cato-slrect

</p>
<p>there I saw Wilson and Davidsoii ; I r.D.cl seen him

<p>(Davidson) before. Davidson said I was come,
</p>
<p>and he asked me if I would go in, 1 said no, as I
</p>
<p>was going somewhere else to look for some
</p>
<p>cream. He said if I would go in, :\Ir. Thistle-
</p>
<p>wood was there. I asked him what time I should
</p>
<p>be there, and he said eight o'clock. If 1 were
</p>
<p>not there in time, he said, 1 was to follow them
</p>
<p>down to Grosvenor-squarc, and, at the fourth
</p>
<p>house from the corner, at the bottom of the square,
</p>
<p>I should tind them.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus.  I am not
</p>
<p>certain whether the first conversation 1 had with
</p>
<p>Wilson was before the Sunday, before the Cato-
</p>
<p>street business. I am not quite certain. It was
</p>
<p>four or five days before. 1 am not able to say
</p>
<p>what day I gave the information to Lord Har-
</p>
<p>rowby. It might be a day or two beibre I saw
</p>
<p>Wilson in Manchester-street. The conversation
</p>
<p>with Wilson was in Manchester-street ; we were
</p>
<p>walking up and down the street.
</p>
<p>A note was here put into witness's hand, which
</p>
<p>he said was the one given by him to Lorel Har-
</p>
<p>rowby. It was in his own hand- writing.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined.  The reason why 1 gave the
</p>
<p>note to Lord Harrowby was, because I could not
</p>
<p>see Lord Castlercagh.  1 did not call at Lord
</p>
<p>Castlereagh's house, but I went three or four
</p>
<p>times near the house, in order to see him. I did
</p>
<p>not see him, and then I gave the note to Lord
</p>
<p>Harrowby. 1 am certain that in Wilson's con-
</p>
<p>versation v.'ith me, the words, " His Majesty's
</p>
<p>jMinisters," were used.

<p>166 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>it was on Wednesday, the 23d. Only those who
</p>
<p>compose the Cabinet are invited to Cabinet
</p>
<p>dinners. I believe the invitations went out the
</p>
<p>latter part of the week before, but my head
</p>
<p>servant can speak to that more correctly. Invi-
</p>
<p>tations were sent to the Lord Chancellor ; to the
</p>
<p>Earl of Liverpool, the First Lord of the Treasury ;
</p>
<p>to Mr. Vansittart, the chancellor of the Ex-
</p>

<p>Privy-Councillors. They are employed in the

<p>different offices I have mentioned, and also form
</p>
<p>what is called the Cabinet, In common par-
</p>
<p>lance they are called his Majesty's Ministers.
</p>
<p>On the Tuesday before the intended dinner, I
</p>
<p>was ridmg in the Park without a servant. It was
</p>
<p>about two o'clock. I went to a Council at Carlton-
</p>
<p>House. I am not positive as to the hour. As I
</p>
<p>came near Grosvenor-gate a person met me, and
</p>
<p>asked me if 1 was Lord Harrowby. I said, yes.
</p>
<p>He said he wished to give a note to Lord
</p>
<p>Castlereagh, which was of considerable im-
</p>
<p>portance to him and to myself. He then gave me
</p>
<p>a letter. After some further conversation, he

<p>to my liead servant, to say the Cabinet would not
</p>
<p>dine there. It would be seven, or half past, at
</p>
<p>which the party would dine.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood.  I had some
</p>
<p>general knowledge of some cons])iracy, or some-
</p>
<p>thing of the kind, going on before this. I do not
</p>
<p>know a person named Edwards. We had some
</p>
<p>general information a considerable time before
</p>
<p>this, that some plan was in agitation, but we did
</p>
<p>not know the time at which it was to take place,
</p>
<p>or the particulars. I will not say to two months.
</p>
<p>It was some considerable time before this.

<p>JoHx Baker examined by the Attorney-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral.  I am butler to Lord Harrowby. The
</p>
<p>cards of invitation were issued for the cabinet
</p>
<p>dinner on the 18th. or 19th. It was about eight
</p>
<p>in the evening of the 23d when I first knew that
</p>
<p>the Cabinet were not to dine at my Lord Har-
</p>
<p>rowby's. The preparations for it went on till
</p>
<p>then. The xVrchbishop of York lives next door to
</p>
<p>my Lord Ilarrowby's. I can't say whether his
</p>
<p>grace had company on the 23d of February. 1
</p>
<p>noticed several carriages draw up at his door.

</p>
<p>General.  I am by trade a shoemaker. I gene-
</p>
<p>rally live near Brooks'-market, but I am now a
</p>
<p>prisoner in the Tower. I know the prisoner This-
</p>
<p>tlewood. I met him at the house of one Ford
</p>
<p>some weeks before the transactions of the 23d of
</p>
<p>February. He afterwards called upon me at my
</p>
<p>lodgings. lie was not alone. Brunt was with
</p>
<p>him. He told me that he wanted to speak with
</p>
<p>me in private. In consequence I went out of the
</p>
<p>room with him, my mother and brother being at

<p>that time in the room with me. Brunt staid
</p>
<p>behind when I went out. Thistlewood then said
</p>
<p>to me, " Great events are now close at hand 
</p>
<p>the people are every where anxious for a change.
</p>
<p>He had been promised support by a great many
</p>
<p>168 CATO-STREET COXSPIRACV.
</p>
<p>men, who had deceived him, but he had now got
</p>
<p>men who would stand by him."
</p>
<p>He then asked me if 1 had any arms. I said,
</p>
<p>*' No, I had not." He said, that every man of
</p>
<p>them, that is, of those who were attached to him,
</p>
<p>had arms, pikes, pistols, or sabres ; and added,
</p>
<p>that I might buy a pistol for four or five shillings,
</p>
<p>I said that I was too poor to buy one. He replied,
</p>
<p>that if such were the case, he would see what
</p>
<p>could be done for me. Brunt called upon me
</p>
<p>again in four or five days. He said, that he could
</p>
<p>not stay long with me ; there were several more
</p>
<p>men of his trade waiting to see him on this busi-
</p>
<p>ness, and he must call on them. I did not see
</p>
<p>him afterwards for some time. He called, how-
</p>
<p>ever, again upon me on the Tuesday previous to
</p>
<p>the 23d. 1 then told him that I thought I had
</p>
<p>lost him, as he had staid away so very long. He
</p>
<p>replied, that owing to the King's death, an alte-
</p>
<p>ration had taken place in their plans. I asked
</p>
<p>what those plans were. He said that I should
</p>
<p>know them better at a meeting to be held the
</p>
<p>night afterwards, than he could tell me. I asked
</p>
<p>him where the meeting was to be. He said at
</p>
<p>Tyburn-turnpike. He did not tell me what was
</p>
<p>to be done there.
</p>
<p>I asked him if I was to see any persons there
</p>
<p>how I was to know them as friends, and requested
</p>
<p>him to give me the word. Brunt then told me,
</p>
<p>that if I saw v.nj persons about, I was to say
</p>
<p>B-U-T ; and if they were friends, they would say
</p>
<p>T-O-N. He would, however, call on me the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing morning, and tell me more particulars.
</p>
<p>On the Wednesday afternoon, between four

<p>and five, he did call again : he came by himself.
</p>
<p>He called me down stairs, and asked me if 1 was
</p>
<p>ready to go. I said, " No, I have got some
</p>
<p>work to do, and it nAist be done before I go.''
</p>
<p>He asked me how long it would be before it was

</p>
<p>hiiishod. 1 said, that it would be done about six
</p>
<p>o'clock. He then said, that he could not wait for
</p>
<p>me so long  that I must therefore come to the
</p>
<p>place appointed along with the man to whom he
</p>
<p>had introduced me ; that man's name was Tidd.
</p>
<p>He charged me not to be later than six o'clock, as
</p>
<p>Tidd had others as well as myself, to take with
</p>
<p>him to the place of meeting,
</p>
<p>I went to Tidd's at half-past six, who com-
</p>
<p>plained that many men had disappointed him.
</p>
<p>We waited till seven, but no person came. Tidd
</p>
<p>then went into a corner of the room, took out a
</p>
<p>large pistol, and stuck it in a belt, which he wore
</p>
<p>round his waist. He also took out four or five
</p>
<p>pike-heads, which he wrapped up in brown paper.
</p>
<p>He took also several shafts, four or five feet long.
</p>
<p>We then went out, along Holborn, and up Oxford-
</p>
<p>street. I asked him, in his room, where we were
</p>
<p>going. He said to a room in a mews in John-
</p>
<p>street, Edgware-road. When we got into Holborn,
</p>
<p>he gave me the pike-shafts, and told me to take
</p>
<p>care of them. 1 asked him again, as we were
</p>
<p>going along, where we were going ; and wanted
</p>
<p>to know whether it was to the House of Commons.
</p>
<p>He said, " No, there w'ere too many soldiers near
</p>
<p>there." I again pressed him on the subject, and
</p>
<p>he said that they w^ere going to Grosvenor-square,
</p>
<p>as there was a cabinet dinner there that evening,
</p>
<p>I did not ask him any more questions ; for on his
</p>
<p>saying that, I was satisfied for what purpose they
</p>
<p>were going.
</p>
<p>We then went to Cato-street. Under the arch-
</p>
<p>way I saw two men, whom Tidd apjieared to
</p>
<p>know. He spoke to them ; and, after a few

<p>moments we all went into the stable together.
</p>
<p>There were in the loft and stable about twenty-
</p>
<p>four or twenty-five persons. I had not been
</p>
<p>there long when sonie one proposed to count the
</p>
<p>numbers assembled. Thistlewood replied, iluil
</p>
<p>there was no occasion to do so, as he knew t)r,:(
</p>
<p>z
</p>
<p>170 CATO-STRF.ET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>there were about four or five and twenty persons
</p>
<p>in the room. There was a person in a brown
</p>
<p>great coat sitting on a carpenter's bench, who
</p>
<p>spoke of the impropriety of going with so small a
</p>
<p>number to Lord llarrowby's. Thistlewood re-
</p>
<p>plied, there were quite enough of them. He only
</p>
<p>wanted thirteen to go into the room, and sup-
</p>
<p>posing Lord Harrowby to have sixteen servants,
</p>
<p>that number would be c|uite enough to master
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>The man in the brown coat said, "After we have
</p>
<p>done, there will be a crowd about the door, how
</p>
<p>arc we to make our escape?'"' Thistlewood said,
</p>
<p>" You know the larger body is already gone to
</p>
<p>arrange matters ; we, the smaller, are left to do
</p>
<p>the business."' Davidson then blamed the tall
</p>
<p>man in the brown great coat for throwing cold
</p>
<p>water on the plan, and added, that if he was
</p>
<p>afraid, he might as well go away. Brunt said,
</p>
<p>" Rather than give up the business, I will go to
</p>
<p>the house and blow it up, though I perish myself
</p>
<p>in the ruins, for you know we have got that which
</p>
<p>can easily do it." The man in the great coat
</p>
<p>then said, as they were all for it, he would not
</p>
<p>oppose iL lie then proposed that all in the room
</p>
<p>should put themselves under the orders of This-
</p>
<p>(lewood. Upon v/hich Thistlewood said, that all
</p>
<p>engaged in the business were equal, and should
</p>
<p>nave the same honour as himself, and proposed
</p>
<p>that fourteen should volunteer to go into the room
</p>
<p>at Lord llarrowby's. Those that volunteered

<p>I lieard nothing said of what the rest were to

<p>lig-ence that the Duke of WeHingtoii and Loici

<p>myself taken into eustody in the room.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus.  I never
</p>
<p>saw Thistlewood till I saw him at Ford's. I at-
</p>
<p>tended at the meetini"- in FiniV-ury-market. I was
</p>
<p>so far off that 1 could ni)t tell whether Thistle-
</p>
<p>wood was there, nor even the })ur[)osc of the
</p>
<p>meeting. There was no particular acc[uaintance at
</p>
<p>diat time betw^een me and Thistlewood. I did not
</p>
<p>then know ]3runt or lildwards. 'J'here was a lon^
</p>
<p>interval between my first and second conversation
</p>
<p>with Brunt. I thought that they had done with
</p>
<p>me, finding me so reluctant to join in their mea-
</p>
<p>sures. The man in the brow^n coat was not
</p>
<p>Adams. I have seen Adams since, at Ilicks's
</p>
<p>Hall. The room was much crowded  the parties
</p>
<p>in it were eating bread and cheese. 1 do not
</p>
<p>know that I ever saw Adams before I saw him at
</p>
<p>Hicks's Hall. I recollect the prisoner Davidson
</p>
<p>from his colour. If any person had addressed
</p>
<p>them besides the man in the brown coat, 1 must
</p>
<p>have heard him. I was taken in the room when
</p>
<p>tlie soldiers came. I had no arms. 1 made no

<p>resistance.

<p>Re-examined by the Solicitor-Cxcneral.  1 was

<p>how I could tell such a ialschood, when I had

<p>never seen such a man as Edwards in niy life.

<p>He said that was of no conse([uencc. If asked wiial

</p>
<p>By a Juryman.- I have had no communication
</p>
<p>with Adams since my apprehension.
</p>
<p>By the Solicitor-General.  I never saw him ex-
</p>
<p>cept when I was brought up as a witness to
</p>
<p>Hicks's Hall.
</p>
<p>Thomas Monument.-^I am brother to the
</p>
<p>last witness. I remember Thistlewood calling
</p>
<p>upon my brother. He brought Brunt with him.
</p>
<p>They did not stay in the room more than five or
</p>
<p>ten minutes. Thistlewood then asked my brotiier
</p>
<p>if he might speak with him. On my brother's
</p>
<p>replying yes, they went out together for ten
</p>
<p>minutes. They then returned ; and Brunt and
</p>
<p>Thistlewood went away.
</p>
<p>On the Tueday before the Cato-street busi-
</p>
<p>ness, Brunt called again on my brother, with a
</p>
<p>man named Tidd. My brother said, '* Brunt, I
</p>
<p>have not seen you for so long a time, that I thought
</p>
<p>1 had lost you." Brunt said, " The King's death
</p>
<p>had made some alteration in our plans." My
</p>
<p>brother asked what those plans were. Brunt
</p>
<p>said, they had different objects in view. Brunt
</p>
<p>asked my brother to meet him at Tyburn-turnpike
</p>
<p>that evening, when an outline of their plan should
</p>
<p>be given to him. Brunt said that he ought to be
</p>

<p>me to go, but spoke only to my brother. 1 did
</p>
<p>not go. Brunt called at five the next evening for

<p>my brother to go. He said, he could not go then,

</p>
<p>pecting that any mischief was going on, I was not

<p>anxious to know to what the conversation ol my

</p>
<p>brother and Brunt referred. I thought that it
</p>
<p>might perhaps relate to some club-dinner.
</p>
<p>Thomas Dwyer examined by Mr. Gurney.  I
</p>
<p>live in Cheese-court, Oxford-street. Some time
</p>
<p>in February I became acquainted with Davidson.
</p>
<p>He introduced me to Thistlewood. We went to-
</p>
<p>gether to a public-honse at the end of Molyneux-
</p>
<p>street, not far from Cato-street. This might be
</p>
<p>about the 9th, 1 0th, or 11th of February. This-
</p>
<p>tlewood said nothing particular to me at that
</p>
<p>time. He observed, that he had been in four or
</p>
<p>five revolutions, and that Ireland was in a dis-
</p>
<p>turbed state. 1 am an Irishman. Thistlewood
</p>
<p>said, tliat he had a good many of my countrymen
</p>
<p>with him. He pressed me to go with him also.
</p>
<p>I saw Davidson on the night before the 23d.
</p>
<p>He told me that he was going to stand sentry.
</p>
<p>The next morning I was called upon by a per-
</p>
<p>son, who took me to Fox-court, Gray's Inn-lane.
</p>
<p>He was a tall man, and his name is Harrison.
</p>
<p>We went into a two-pair back room ; the room
</p>
<p>door was locked. He knocked at another door,
</p>
<p>and a woman gave him the key. He opened the
</p>
<p>door, and we entered.
</p>
<p>There was a cupboard in the room, out of which
</p>
<p>was taken a ball, wrapped up in yarn. Harrison
</p>
<p>told me the purpose for which it was intended,
</p>
<p>and called it a grenade. Shortly afterwards
</p>
<p>Thistlewood, Davidson, and a few more, came in.
</p>
<p>Davidson had a blunderbuss, a pair of pistols, and
</p>
<p>a bayonet, in his side pocket. Others also came
</p>
<p>in, but 1 did not know their names. [The wit-
</p>
<p>ness was here told to look into the dock, and see
</p>
<p>if he could identify any of the prisoners as being

</p>
<p>then present. He instantly identified Brunt.]
</p>
<p>On Davidson's saying that he had only given
</p>
<p>twelve shillings for his justols. Brunt said he
</p>
<p>would go out and buy a pair.
</p>
<p>I had some conversation with Thistlewood
</p>
<p>about the hand-<n-cnades. Thistlewood said, that
</p>
<p>174 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>some of them were to be thrown into the horse-
</p>
<p>barracks, and others into Lord Ilarrowbys house,
</p>
<p>to set fire to it, and blow it up. Thistlewood
</p>
<p>asked me how many of my countrymen I could
</p>
<p>muster, as he should want some of them at hall-
</p>
<p>past eight that evening. I told him that I could
</p>
<p>muster about twenty-six or twenty-seven. He
</p>
<p>told me that they, meaning himself and friends,
</p>
<p>were to assemble at the Horse and Groom ; and
</p>
<p>ordered me to be at the Pontefract Castle, at the
</p>
<p>end of Barret's-court, a house much frequented
</p>
<p>by Irishmen. He told me that I was to pick out
</p>
<p>the best of my countrymen, and go to the Found-
</p>
<p>ling Hospital, knock at the porter's lodge, put a
</p>
<p>pistol to his breast, and turn on to the right
</p>
<p>hand, as there were twenty-five or twenty- six
</p>
<p>stand of arms in the other lodge : these I was to
</p>
<p>seize. At the same time another party would
</p>
<p>secure two pieces of cannon which were in the
</p>
<p>Light Horse Riding-School, Gray's Inn-lane.
</p>
<p>Another party was in the meantime to go to the
</p>
<p>Artillery-ground, Finsbury, and seize what was
</p>
<p>there. He also mentioned that there was to be
</p>
<p>a cabinet dinner at Lord Harrowby's, and that
</p>
<p>the party there were to be attacked.
</p>
<p>After this, I saw a bundle, containing gun-
</p>
<p>powder, taken out and laid upon the floor; a
</p>
<p>tin measure was produced, and several smaller
</p>
<p>woollen bags Avere filled with it. This was done
</p>
<p>by Harrison. I afterwards heard Thistlewood
</p>
<p>give directions generally to them all. He said
</p>
<p>that a dozen pike-handles were to be taken to
</p>
<p>Mary-le-bone, some others to Finsbury, and some
</p>
<p>elsewhere. I was asked, but refused, to take

</p>
<p>which had been measured out, and also the gre-
</p>
<p>nades, were put into it.
</p>
<p>I heard directions given to a man by Harrison,

<p>to take something to the Horse and (Jrooni, at

</p>
<p>another person went out to get the pike-handles.
</p>
<p>I g'ot back to my own place at twelve o'clock.
</p>
<p>I told IVIajor James of what 1 had seen and heard :
</p>
<p>in consequence of what he said, I went to the
</p>
<p>Secretary of State about one, or half-past one
</p>
<p>o'clock that day.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by I\Ir. Curwood.  1 am a
</p>
<p>bricklayer by trade. 1 never, before tlie month
</p>
<p>of February, saw Davidson. Davidson intro-
</p>
<p>duced me to Thistlewood on the ninth of that
</p>
<p>month. They did not know me, and I did not
</p>
<p>know them, yet I was let into their secrets on
</p>
<p>the mornmg of the 23d of February. I have
</p>
<p>lived fifteen years in the parish of Mary-le-bone,
</p>
<p>with a good character, and yet all of a sudden a
</p>
<p>band of traitors intrusted me with their traitorous
</p>
<p>designs, I told them that it was a hard thing
</p>
<p>to inveigle men into a scheme like theirs, and
</p>
<p>doubted whether I should be able to accomplish
</p>
<p>it. Though 1 expressed this doubt, I was sent
</p>
<p>to the Foundling Hospital to take the arms. 1
</p>
<p>acceded to their proposal at the time, but had
</p>
<p>no intention of executing it. I do not know a
</p>
<p>man of the name of IIu<>glestone. I never was
</p>
<p>in a court before, except on the trial of a woman
</p>
<p>for stealin"-. I was in Ireland at the time of the
</p>
<p>rebellion. I cannot tell how old I was then.

<p>George Kavlock examined by Mr. Ijttledale.
</p>
<p>I live at 22, Cato-strcet. 1 saw Harrison and
</p>
<p>another against the stable-door in Cato-street, at
</p>
<p>five o'clock on the 2.'kl February. I asked
</p>
<p>ilarrison how he did. He replied, ])retty well;

<p>he had taken two rooms there, and was going to

</p>
<p>Richaud Aioxday examined by Mr. Lit-
</p>
<p>tledale.  I live at C:3, Ciito-slreet. About twenty
</p>
<p>minutes after lour, on (he 23d, as ] was coming
</p>
<p>from mv work, I saw Davidson standing- under
</p>
<p>17G rATO-STRKF.T CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>the archway. I knew Davidson, from seemg- liini
</p>
<p>with Firth, the cow-keeper. I went home and
</p>
<p>got my tea. I came out again at twenty minutes
</p>
<p>past five, and went to a public-house. On leaving
</p>
<p>it, I saw Davidson going into No. 1 for a light.
</p>
<p>In going into the stable, into which Harrison ad-
</p>
<p>mitted him, he stooped for a bundle, and I then
</p>
<p>observed that he had two belts on, one across his
</p>
<p>shoulder, and the other round his waist; in that
</p>
<p>round his waist, on the left side, two pistols were
</p>
<p>inserted ; on the other a sword was suspended,
</p>
<p>which jutted out considerably. The place where
</p>
<p>they met is a stable, belonging to General Wat-
</p>
<p>son ; it has lately been used as a cow-house by
</p>
<p>Firth. There is a chaise-house, and a stable
</p>
<p>below, and a loft, with two rooms above. One
</p>
<p>of these rooms has a window, the other is dark.
</p>
<p>I observed, in the course of the afternoon, that
</p>
<p>something like a coarse matting was hung over
</p>
<p>the windows, and the partition in the stable-
</p>
<p>yard.
</p>
<p>Elizabeth Westall.  I live at No. 1, Cato-
</p>
<p>street. About three o'clock I saw a man go into
</p>
<p>the stable with a sack on his shoulder. About
</p>
<p>six o'clock I went out, and saw a man of colour
</p>
<p>standing by the stable. 1 was much alarmed by
</p>
<p>that circumstance, thinking that the stable was
</p>
<p>unoccupied. I was out ten minutes. Shortly
</p>
<p>after 1 returned, the man of colour came into my
</p>
<p>house, and asked me for a light. I gave him a
</p>
<p>light. He then went back to the stable where I
</p>
<p>had seen him at first.
</p>
<p>George Rutiiven, the police-officer, was then
</p>
<p>examined by Mr. Bolland.

<p>I went, on the 23d of February, to Cato-street,
</p>
<p>Three others were to meet me there. When we
</p>
<p>were all assembled we were about twelve of us.
</p>
<p>I went into the stable, and saw a man with a
</p>
<p>sword by his side, and a blunderbuss on his
</p>
<p>shoulder. 1 saw one man below, and 1 liave
</p>
<p>TRIAL OT Tuisi [.F\roori. 177
</p>
<p>some faint recollection that I saw another. The
</p>
<p>whole of my party followed me into the stable.
</p>
<p>On .seeing the man with the hlimdcrbuss on his
</p>
<p>shoulder, I told some of the party to secure him.
</p>
<p>I went up a ladtler, which led to a loft.
</p>
<p>When I got there I saw several men ; heard the
</p>
<p>clattering of arms, and saw swords and pistols.
</p>
<p>Three or four of my party went up with me. I
</p>
<p>am sure that Ell's and Smithers were with me.
</p>
<p>From the view which I had of the place, I think
</p>
<p>there were 24 or 25 persons present. The size
</p>
<p>of that room is 15 feet, five one way, and ten feet
</p>
<p>ten the other. There are two rooms adjoining
</p>
<p>this, separated by doors. When I got into the
</p>
<p>room, I said, " we are officers; seize their arms."
</p>
<p>I saw in the room Thistlcwood, whum I have
</p>
<p>known for four or five years.
</p>
<p>Thistlewood was standing-, at the tin^ie we en-
</p>
<p>tered, at the right hand side of the table, near the
</p>
<p>door of the little room. On my saying, " We
</p>
<p>are officers," he seized a sword, wliich was drawn,
</p>
<p>and retreated to the little room. The sword was
</p>
<p>a very long one, and rather bright. He stood in
</p>
<p>the entry of the door fencing, to prevent any one's
</p>
<p>approach. Smithers a})proached him. Thistle-
</p>
<p>wood stabbed him, and Smithers fell, saying,
</p>
<p>" Oh, my God ! I'm done," or something to that
</p>
<p>effect. Somebody from the corner of the room
</p>
<p>where Thistlewood stood said, *' Put out the
</p>
<p>lights  kill the b rs, and throw them down
</p>
<p>stairs." The lights were then pnt out ; I joined in
</p>
<p>their cry of " kill them," and rushed down stairs.
</p>
<p>I did not observe any thing till I got into John-
</p>
<p>street, where 1 met the soldiers, whom I brought.

<p>Several shots were fired irom the corner of the
</p>
<p>room where Thistlewood was standing; 1 think
</p>
<p>down the stairs. On arriving a second time at the
</p>
<p>stable, I met 'J'idd grappling with one of the mili-
</p>
<p>tarv. 1 secured him. 1 was afterward.-; in the

</p>
<p>burn brought in. On him were found six ball-
</p>
<p>cartridges and three bails. Davidson and Wilson
</p>
<p>were brought in. Davidson sang a song. I then
</p>
<p>went back to the loft, and found there, Shaw
</p>
<p>Strange, Cooper, Monument, and Bradb-irn. I
</p>
<p>saw arms in the hands of several persons. I found
</p>
<p>two swords and a bag. The bag contained ten
</p>
<p>band-grenades. I also found balls and fusees.
</p>
<p>They were brought to Bow-street, and remained
</p>
<p>since in possession of an officer. Afterwards I
</p>
<p>went to the Horse and Groom. I had seen Cooper
</p>
<p>there, with a stick, and Gilchrist came back for it,
</p>
<p>but did not get it. 1 observed it cut.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus.  Thistle-
</p>
<p>wood had not been much out of sight since Wat-
</p>
<p>son's trial. Witness had seen him five or six
</p>
<p>times. He had a motive for it. It was not for
</p>
<p>this purpose, that he was aware of. There were
</p>
<p>four or five Edwardses, officers with him, but he
</p>
<p>was not aware that Edwards, who had been con-
</p>
<p>cerned in this business, was connected with any
</p>
<p>of them. He knew nothing further, than that he
</p>
<p>was directed to watch Thistlewood.
</p>
<p>James Ellis, by the Attorney-General. Went
</p>
<p>with the other officers to Cato-street on the 23d of
</p>
<p>February ; he went in immediately after llulhven.
</p>
<p>He saw two men, one having on two cross-belts ;
</p>
<p>either m his right or left holding a carbine, in the
</p>
<p>other a sword. Witness observed, that he was
</p>
<p>a man of colour. The other person was betv/een
</p>
<p>the foot of the ladder and the stall next to it, for
</p>
<p>there were three. He followed Ruthven up as
</p>
<p>close as he could. The man of colour said some-
</p>
<p>thing ending with " men.'' He heard the men

<p>above rushing back behind the carpenter's table,
</p>
<p>and a noise like fencing with swords. There
</p>
<p>might be twenty or twenty-five men. lluthven
</p>
<p>said, *' We are officers, seize their arms, or sur-
</p>
<p>render your arms."
</p>
<p>Witness had not known Thistlewood before,
</p>
<p>TiUAf, or 'iiii^ 1 r.KwooD, l7;)
</p>
<p>but he was satisfied it w;is he who mciuiced with
</p>
<p>the sword. Witness had before held forward his
</p>
<p>staff of olfiee ; he now presented a ])istol, and de-
</p>
<p>sired him to desist, or he would fire. Sniithers
</p>
<p>then g-ained the top of the ladder, and advaneed
</p>
<p>towards the little room. Thistlewood struck hiiu
</p>
<p>with the sword near the breast. Sniithers kli
</p>
<p>back, lield up his hands, and exclaimed, " C),
</p>
<p>God !'* Witness fired on Thistlewood, and Smi-
</p>
<p>thers staggered towards him. The candles were
</p>
<p>put out, and the witness was forced down. ITe
</p>
<p>stood at the door to tlie street. Several shots
</p>
<p>were fired : some balls passed him. On going out
</p>
<p>he heard a cry. Saw a man running towards
</p>
<p>Queen-street, with belts on. He secured him. It
</p>
<p>was Davidson, the man of colour. He had a car-
</p>
<p>bine m the one hand, and a sword in the other.
</p>
<p>He afterwards assisted in securing foiu', to whom
</p>
<p>he could not speak positively.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood.  He w;is a
</p>
<p>constable, and had the warraiU. He had a part in

<p>He was down in the stable the whole time, and
</p>
<p>heard firing on the lott. He saw lugs in the
</p>
<p>stable, who wanted to rush out, while the other
</p>
<p>olheers were up. Witness and Ings had a
</p>
<p>contest. There was terrible confusion in tlie

</p>
<p>saw Iluthven, Ellis, and the deceased go up the
</p>
<p>ladder. He went up, and saw Ellis fire. There
</p>
<p>was a rush down, and he saw a man fire a pistol ;
</p>
<p>he rather believed it was Thistlewood. Ings was
</p>
<p>pursued and brouoht back. Witness found a
</p>
<p>sword in the stable, and a bayonet up stairs.
</p>
<p>John Wright, a patrol of Bow-street, was
</p>
<p>one of the officers who went to Cato-street. They
</p>
<p>mustered at the Horse and Groom. He saw
</p>
<p>Cooper having a broom-stick, and another coming
</p>
<p>to drink beer. Cooper left the stick. Witness
</p>
<p>took a sword and a knife from a man who was in
</p>
<p>the stable, near a stall. That moment he was
</p>
<p>knocked down, and received a stab in his side.
</p>
<p>Wilson and Bradburn were afterwards taken.
</p>
<p>Witness found about two dozen ball-cartridges in
</p>
<p>Wilson's pocket, and a pair of scissors ; and
</p>
<p>found two haversacks on his sides.
</p>
<p>William Charles Brookes, a patrol, being
</p>
<p>directed by Mr. Birnie towards persons passing,
</p>
<p>saw Ings, and a person in front of him with a
</p>
<p>cutlass, and spoke to them. Ings fired, and
</p>
<p>slightly wounded him on the shoulder. Witness
</p>
<p>staggered into the road. Ings went off" towards
</p>
<p>the Edgware-road, Witness pursued. [ngs
</p>
<p>threw away the pistol. Moy took him. Witness
</p>
<p>asked him why he had fired at him, a man whom
</p>
<p>he had never seen. He said, " I wish I had killed

<p>you."

<p>Ings.  " Pray, my Lord, am I not allowed to

<p>he was concerned.
</p>
<p>Robert Chapman, one of the Bow-strcct offi-

<p>John-street on the 23d of February, about eight
</p>
<p>in the evening. On hearing reports of pistols,
</p>
<p>they went to Cato-street. He was directed by a
</p>
<p>police-officer to the stable. He met two men at
</p>
<p>the door : the man on his right cut at him with a
</p>
<p>sword, the other man presented a pistol. He got
</p>
<p>in and seized a man, who called out, " Don't kill
</p>
<p>me, and I will tell you all." He gave him in
</p>
<p>charge, and then secured another man in one of
</p>
<p>the stalls. On going up stairs, he secured three,
</p>
<p>four, or five persons. He fell against the body
</p>
<p>of poor Smithers, who was lying dead. He saw
</p>
<p>several arms.
</p>
<p>Samuel Tauntox, a Bow-street officer, went
</p>
<p>to Brunt's lodgings, searched the front and back
</p>
<p>rooms, and found two baskets. Brunt, who was
</p>
<p>in the front room, and had been previously taken
</p>
<p>into custody, said, he k'lcw nothing of the

<p>baskets. The room did not belong to him in

<p>to Whitecross-street, Moorfields. The house was

<p>kept by Harris. He received a key from Mrs.

<p>Harris, which opened a ground-floor. There ho

<p>the clothes in bed ; the shutters were shut. Wit-
</p>

</p>
<p>sword in one hand, and a staff in the other, threw
</p>
<p>himself on the bed. Thistlew^ood said, he would
</p>
<p>make no resistance. He had his breeches on. in

<p>THE DEFENCE.

<p>Mr. CuRwooD now rose to address the Jury on
</p>
<p>the part of the prisoner. He commenced by stat-
</p>
<p>ing, " That if it were consistent with a sense of
</p>
<p>moral and professional duty, he would not have

<p>stood there to address them. It was one of the

<p>the honour to belong, however, and one which

<p>perhaps reflected upon it the greatest credit, that
</p>
<p>they were not at liberty to refuse their assistance
</p>
<p>to persons in the situation of the unfortunate man
</p>
<p>at the bar. No man could feel more impressed
</p>
<p>than himself with the sense of the great and
</p>
<p>weighty duty he had to perform. He felt that the
</p>
<p>unhappy prisoner had a right to call upon him to
</p>
<p>do his duty boldly and fearlessly, and without any
</p>
<p>consideration for the Government who were the
</p>
<p>prosecutors on this occasion ; he felt also that he
</p>
<p>had a duty to perform to his country, by assisting

<p>in the administration of the law, and not by any
</p>
<p>power which he possessed, if he did possess such

<p>power, to endeavour to pervert that law. lie

</p>
<p>their attention had been so painfully directed, had
</p>
<p>arisen out of" that state of the country which they
</p>
<p>must all alike lament and deplore. It was clear
</p>
<p>also, that while they had attachments to certain
</p>
<p>parties, prejudices would arise which it was out of
</p>
<p>their power to control in favour of the sentiments
</p>
<p>of those parties. \\'ith respect to himself, although
</p>
<p>like every other Englishman, he had his feelings
</p>
<p>upon certain points, yet he never belonged to any
</p>
<p>particular party, nor was he in the habit of at-
</p>
<p>tending political meetings. With respect to Go-
</p>
<p>vernment, he never had received any place or ap-
</p>
<p>pointment from them, nor was it likely that he
</p>
<p>should. In the present instance, therefore, he had
</p>
<p>no motive to influence him in doing his duty,
</p>
<p>or at least in endeavouring to do it fairly and
</p>
<p>honestly.
</p>
<p>' It was due to his Learned Friends and to
</p>
<p>himself to state, that in consequence of the late-
</p>
<p>ness of the moment in which they were called

<p>upon to undertake this arduous task, not having

<p>received their instructions till a late hour on

<p>had to cope were ot no ordinary kind ; and these

<p>difiiculties l^ecame the more formidable, when it

<p>was recollected that they had arrayed against them

<p>little aided by the advantage of study, and of a

<p>this case, tlicy had not lailed to o'oserve, and he
</p>
<p>had observed it with unfeigned surprise, iliat he
</p>
<p>Irad not ^-iatcd to tliein precisely what v.cre the
</p>
<p>points which they were called upon to try. He
</p>
<p>iiud iiuli'cd stated that it was a prosecution fur

</p>
<p>18G CATO-STIIEET CONSPJUACV.
</p>
<p>the quality of the treason which he meant to
</p>
<p>impute.
</p>
<p>" Unfortunately, there was mixed up Maththis
</p>
<p>transaction a great deal for which the prisoner
</p>
<p>might hereafter be answerable, and which was
</p>
<p>calculated to make a deep impression on the minds
</p>
<p>of the Jury ; but whatever was their opinion upon
</p>
<p>the moral guilt of the prisoner, if, upon a review
</p>
<p>of the evidence, they should not be of opinion
</p>
<p>that he had committed the precise offence charged
</p>
<p>in the indictment, it was their duty to pronounce
</p>
<p>a verdict of Not Guilty. It therefore devolved
</p>
<p>upon him to state precisely what they had to try ;
</p>
<p>it was not merely a question of high treason, but a
</p>
<p>question of a particular species of high treason.
</p>
<p>*' The indictment was very long, and contained
</p>
<p>many things which, in the language of the law,
</p>
<p>were called overt acts. They were not, however,
</p>
<p>because a great body of evidence had been given
</p>
<p>to them, to jump at the conclusion, that the sub-
</p>
<p>stantive treason alleged had been committed. The
</p>
<p>sorts of treason charged were four in number : the
</p>
<p>first was founded upon the late statute of the 36th
</p>
<p>of the King, for conspiring to depose his majesty
</p>
<p>from his imperial style and dignity. It was now
</p>
<p>nearly 400 years since that statute, to which
</p>
<p>Englishmen had been wont to look with veneration
</p>
<p>as a protection for the dearest rights of man  he
</p>
<p>meant the statute of Edw. III.  had been passed.
</p>
<p>There, among other treasons set forth, was the
</p>
<p>conspiring to take away, or the compassing and
</p>
<p>imagining, or intending to compass or imagine the
</p>
<p>King's death  but there had subsequent treasons
</p>

<p>liament in existence, which embraced not merely
</p>
<p>the compassing and imagining the King's death ;
</p>
<p>but the conspiring to depose him from his imperial
</p>
<p>style and dignity. It was also treason to consj)ire
</p>
<p>to levy war against his majesty. This was the
</p>
<p>question then which they had to try.
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF THISTLE WOOD. 18?
</p>
<p>** First, had the prisoners at the bar conspired
</p>
<p>or imagined the death of the King ; secondly, had
</p>
<p>they conspired to depose his Majesty from his im-
</p>
<p>perial style and dignity ; thirdly, had they con-
</p>
<p>spired to levy war against the King ; and lastly,
</p>
<p>had they actually levied war against the King ?
</p>
<p>He apprehended that they must be satisfied that
</p>
<p>one or other of these charges was proved, before
</p>
<p>they could find a verdict of guilty.
</p>
<p>" Before he came to these topics, they would
</p>
<p>look to the probability of the evidence which had
</p>
<p>been laid before them. The great mass which
</p>
<p>had been adduced certainly led them to conclude
</p>
<p>that a conspiracy of some kind had existed ; but
</p>
<p>it did not follow that the substantive treason
</p>
<p>charged in the indictment had therefore been
</p>
<p>committed. It did not follow, as a matter of
</p>
<p>course, that the removal of the administration of
</p>
<p>the King must be succeeded by the deposition of
</p>
<p>the Monarch himself. Let them go by steps.
</p>
<p>There was continually in Parliament one party
</p>
<p>endeavouring to remove another ; that was to say,
</p>
<p>endeavouring to remove the existing administra-
</p>
<p>tion. He would admit, probably with the best
</p>
<p>intentions.
</p>
<p>" Would it be contended, that this removal
</p>
<p>of an administration was necessarily connected
</p>
<p>with the deposition of the Monarch, and
</p>
<p>that every man who attempted to effect such a
</p>
<p>purpose would be involved in the crime of high
</p>
<p>treason ?
</p>
<p>" Again, other men might think it necessary
</p>
<p>that an administration should be removed by
</p>
<p>violence ; and this too with the most virtuous

<p>intentions. He desired not to be misunder-
</p>
<p>stood, as meaning under that plea to justify as-
</p>
<p>sassination. Nothing was further from his feel-
</p>
<p>ings ; but all he meant to argue was, that they must
</p>
<p>not take it as a necessary consequence that the
</p>
<p>death or destruction of a whole administration
</p>

</p>
<p>188 CATO-STREET COXSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>involved the death or deposition of the King.
</p>
<p>If they (the Jury) were of opinion that it did not
</p>
<p>involve such a consequence, the evidence on this
</p>
<p>occasion did not support the substantive treason
</p>
<p>laid in the two first divisions of the indictment.
</p>
<p>" There were two other treasons, however ;
</p>
<p>one was the conspiracy to levy war against his
</p>
<p>Majesty; and the other, the actual levying of
</p>
<p>war. Now he called upon them to look to the
</p>
<p>evidence, and see whether they could draw from
</p>
<p>that a fair inference, that there was a conspiracy
</p>
<p>to levy war, and that what had been done
</p>
<p>amounted to an actual levying of war. In the
</p>
<p>detail given by the first witness, Adams, who in
</p>
<p>fact proved the whole case  he thought there
</p>
<p>was much more for ridicule, than for serious con-
</p>
<p>sideration. In his opinion, the testimony of this
</p>
<p>man was utterly incredible, independent of the
</p>
<p>fact of his being an accomplice.
</p>
<p>*' The Attorney-General had told them that an
</p>
<p>accomplice was a necessary witness ; but though
</p>
<p>necessary, he was not of necessity to be believed.
</p>
<p>The more atrocious the guilt in which he had
</p>
<p>steeped himself, the less worthy he was of credit ;
</p>
<p>and where a most atrocious and wicked witness
</p>
<p>came to tell them a tale, not only improbable, but
</p>
<p>most ridiculous in itself, would they not at once
</p>
<p>dismiss him from their notice ?
</p>
<p>" It often happened, that those who were the
</p>
<p>most ingenious in devising and promoting mischief,
</p>
<p>were the first to become informers ; and that this
</p>
<p>was the case in the present instance, he should
</p>
<p>be enabled to prove. They would, however,

<p>conspiracy to levy war against the King. They
</p>
<p>would lay out of their consideration for a moment
</p>
<p>all that had been said of the assassination of his

<p>thing to raise their passions.

<p>" They had all the materials and preparations

<p>for war before them (the arms on the taNe) ; but

<p>what was the result of all the discussions which
</p>
<p>took place at all the meetings of the conspirators

<p>from the 4th of February, in which the assassi-

<p>nation of his Majesty's Ministers had been re-

<p>peatedly debated t

<p>peared that one of the conspirators, Palin, liad,
</p>
<p>with some degree of sense, when all those things
</p>
<p>were talked of, asked where the men were to
</p>
<p>come from to effect this mighty revolution ? In
</p>
<p>one moment his Majesty's Ministers were to be
</p>
<p>assassinated !  a detachment was to go and take
</p>
<p>possession of two pieces of cRnnon in Gray's Inn-

<p>lane !  another detachment was to make a descent
</p>
<p>upon the Artillery-Ground !  a third party Mere

<p>to seize the Mansion-house, as a seat for the Pro-

<p>what was the actual strength of the conspirators
</p>
<p>in its most exaggerated state? ^Vhy, forsooth,
</p>
<p>forty men, two old sabres, six shillings, and a
</p>
<p>reputed pound-note ! ! Where an infamous wit-

<p>ness told them such a story could they believe

<p>it ?  was it credible ? Would they take away
</p>

<p>this was a question of fact, which a Jury alone
</p>
<p>was capable of deciding.  That learned Judge
</p>
<p>had als(j talked of " marching with unfurled ban-
</p>
<p>ners, and being furnished with military oiliccrs" 
</p>
<p>but where were the unfurled banners here, or
</p>
<p>where the military othccrs ?  The only luilllury

</p>
<p>man they had heard of was one disbanded soldier,
</p>
<p>and the purpose to which he was to be applied
</p>
<p>was the destruction of his Majesty's Ministers 
</p>
<p>an act which, he contended, even if effected, did
</p>
<p>not amount to a levying of war.  If they were
</p>
<p>told the contrary, he was sure they would
</p>
<p>treat such an intimation as absurd and ridiculous.
</p>
<p>Where was this great conspiracy concocted? In
</p>
<p>a two-pair back room ! Where was the battle
</p>
<p>fought ? In a stable ! Where were the traitors
</p>
<p>incorporated ? In a hay-loft ! How were they
</p>
<p>armed ? With a few rusty swords, halberts, and
</p>
<p>old pistols !
</p>
<p>" He would put it to the plain common sense
</p>
<p>and understanding of the Jury, whether they
</p>
<p>would pronounce persons so assembled and so
</p>
<p>armed, guilty of levying war against the King?
</p>
<p>It was rather a levying war against the constables,
</p>
<p>at the very name of whom they trembled. Then,
</p>
<p>if there was no levying of war, was there a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy to levy war? The only evidence they
</p>
<p>had of such a conspiracy came out of the mouth
</p>
<p>of those three witnesses who were so far con-
</p>
<p>taminated, that it was beyond all doubt they had
</p>
<p>themselves been deeply implicated in the pro-
</p>
<p>jected assassination of his Majesty's Ministers."
</p>
<p>" The question, then, for their consideration
</p>
<p>resolved itself into this point: they would con-
</p>
<p>sider, even supposing that the assassination of
</p>
<p>the Ministers was intended, whether this of ne-
</p>
<p>cessity implied that his Majesty was also to be
</p>
<p>deposed. If they did not think that the one
</p>
<p>must of course follow the other, then their verdict
</p>
<p>must be " Not Guilty." He implored them to

<p>do their duty strictly according to law, to con-
</p>
<p>sider what the law of the country was, to step
</p>
<p>neither to the right nor to the left, but to come to
</p>
<p>a fair and impartial and unprejudiced conclusion.
</p>
<p>He implored them to do so, not only for their
</p>
<p>own sakcs, but for the sake of the country ; for

<p>if once iiirvmcu suffered their feelino:s of indis;-
</p>
<p>nation towards one offence to lead them to admit
</p>
<p>the existence of another of a different character,
</p>
<p>not proved, there would be an end of the due
</p>
<p>distinctions of justice. If this man had been
</p>
<p>guilty of another offence, there was another in-
</p>
<p>dictment against him, on which he must take his
</p>
<p>trial if he were acquitted of this : and if he were
</p>
<p>convicted under that, he would suffer* the pe-
</p>
<p>nalty of the law. But, upon this occasion, he
</p>
<p>called upon them not to find him guilty of
</p>
<p>High Treason, because they thought him worthy
</p>
<p>of death for having incurred the guilt of assas-
</p>
<p>sination.
</p>
<p>" In conclusion, the learned gentleman said,
</p>
<p>he would proceed to call a witness to prove that
</p>
<p>Adams, who had been called for the Crown, to-
</p>
<p>gether with an accomplice of the name of Ed-
</p>
<p>wards, who had not been called, were the persons
</p>
<p>who had conveyed the arms and ammunition to
</p>
<p>the house of Tidd on the very morning they had
</p>
<p>been found there by the Bow-street officers.

<p>who took the rest ; he took them away on Wed-

<p>my father was taken ; it never was uncorded ;

<p>what Edwards was.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-general declined asking this wit-

<p>ness any question.

<p>Edward Hucklestone examined by Mr. Cur-
</p>
<p>wood.  I know a man of the name of Dwyer. I
</p>
<p>have known him for some years. Latterly I have
</p>
<p>known him intimately. 1 used the same public-
</p>
<p>house. I do not think he is to be believed on his
</p>
<p>oath.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by the Attorney-General.  I
</p>
<p>saw him with plenty of money, and knowing that
</p>
<p>he had little or no work, I was surprised. I was
</p>
<p>in distress. He told me he would put me in the
</p>
<p>M^ay to make plenty of money, if I would go with
</p>
<p>him. I agreed ; and he proposed that we should
</p>
<p>charge gentlemen with an unnatural offence. That
</p>
<p>he was to go up first, and then I was to join him.
</p>
<p>I left him quite shocked. This was about three
</p>
<p>months ago. He said he had got ten pounds at a
</p>
<p>time from a gentleman in St. James's-street, by
</p>
<p>only catching him by the collar, and accusing him.
</p>
<p>I met him the next night at the Rodney's-head, and
</p>
<p>he called me a coward. I told him of the danger,
</p>
<p>and reminded him that his brother had been
</p>
<p>transported for the same thing. He said he knew
</p>
<p>better how to general it than his brother. I

<p>might be ill-treated, as 1 had to go so much about

</p>
<p>away from the neighbourhood now, and that in-
</p>
<p>duced me to summon up courage to mention it to

<p>my brother. 1 did go with Dwyer to tlie Park, but
</p>
<p>I was always struck with the horror of the thing.
</p>
<p>When I saw the names of the witnesses in this

<p>case in the paper, 1 made tlie communication to

<p>my brother.

</p>
<p>respecting the cabinet dinner, from the wording,
</p>
<p>I think I did not send. I think so from the use of

</p>
<p>none of them did the parties accused labour under
</p>
<p>such dreadful charges as were now brought against
</p>
<p>the prisoner at the bar ; in none of them had they
</p>
<p>been so totally deprived of all assistance and sup-

<p>port as the unfortunate individual had been on

<p>whose fate they now stood impanelled to decide.

</p>
<p>weight of office arrayed against him  to say that
</p>
<p>the prosecution was conducted with all the talent
</p>
<p>and all the power of Government, was to say
</p>
<p>nothing more than that Thistlewood was indicted
</p>
<p>for high treason. He (Mr. Adojphus) meant not
</p>
<p>to blame the Government for exerting all its ener-
</p>
<p>gies in a case like the present ; by no means  the
</p>
<p>Crown had, on all occasions, and particularly on an
</p>
<p>occasion like this, a right to demand of its best
</p>
<p>servants their best services : he only meant to
</p>
<p>contrast the difficulties against which Thistlewood
</p>
<p>had to contend with those which had surrounded
</p>
<p>other unfortunate rnen in his situation.

<p>" Against the great legal talent which had been

</p>
<p>" Tar different was the case of the unhappy
</p>
<p>man then standing at their bar.

</p>
<p>scarcely at:(juaintcd with the name of the counsel

</p>
<p>scarcely more cariy iiitormation oi" the grounds on
</p>
<p>which his defence was to be rested. He (Mr.
</p>
<p>Adolphus) could assure them that he was only
</p>
<p>chosen counsel for Thistlewood on Thursday last;
</p>
<p>that unavoidable business had ke])t him out of
</p>
<p>town during the whole of Friday ; and tliat he had
</p>
<p>appeared before them on the Monday with such
</p>
<p>information as he could collect in the interim.
</p>
<p>He deplored this circumstance, but he could not
</p>
<p>complain of it. His want of ability and prepara-
</p>
<p>tion was not, however, the only circumstance
</p>
<p>which rendered Thistlewood's case more desperate
</p>
<p>than that of the individuals who had formerly been
</p>
<p>placed in his situation. Many of them had been
</p>
<p>allied with, or supported by, men of power, and
</p>
<p>rank, and influence in the country. Thistlewood,
</p>
<p>on the contrary, was aided by no party, was sup-
</p>
<p>ported by no subscription, but was deserted by
</p>
<p>men of every class and party in the community.
</p>
<p>He (Mr. Adolphus) had received no assistance, no
</p>
<p>information, no instructions, from him ; all that
</p>
<p>he knew of the case vvas derived from the ma-
</p>
<p>terials which the solicitor, the gratuitous solicitor
</p>
<p>for the defence (Mr. Harmer), had been able to
</p>
<p>collect within the last few days,
</p>
<p>" Besides these circumstances was another still
</p>
<p>more extraordinary and unfortunate. At the state
</p>
<p>trials of 1794, whoever was discharged by a ver-
</p>
<p>dict of his countrymen was discharged at once
</p>
<p>from all further prosecution; and with the inquiry
</p>
<p>of that Court ended all inquiry into his conduct.
</p>
<p>" This man, Thistle\\()od, however, was so
</p>
<p>beset, that, even though he obtained at their hands
</p>
<p>a verdict of acquittal upon this charge, he liad to

</p>
<p>midergo a similar trial upon other indictments :
</p>
<p>indeed he (Mr. Adolphus) did not hesitate to say
</p>
<p>that he (Thistlewood) was surrounded by every
</p>
<p>danger which could possibly environ the life of a
</p>
<p>single individual. It a]>peared as if this melan-
</p>
<p>cholv choice alone were left him, whether he would

</p>
<p>have the execution of his sentence end with the

<p>severing of his head from his body, or whether he

<p>would have his body given up after his execution
</p>
<p>to the dissecting knife of the surgeon. If his guilt
</p>
<p>were of such a nature as to demand that penalty
</p>
<p>to be added to the others inflicted by the law, he
</p>
<p>had only himself to blame for it: far was it from
</p>
<p>his (Mr. Adolphus's) intention to palliate his con-
</p>
<p>duct upon that point : the only reason which he
</p>
<p>had for even alluding to it was to implore them to
</p>
<p>place out of their consideration every circum-
</p>
<p>stance which was not connected with the subject
</p>
<p>of their present in\estigation, and which had not
</p>
<p>been brought regularly before them in the course
</p>
<p>of the trial.
</p>
<p>" The Attorney-General had made the same re-
</p>
<p>quest to them, and it had well become his cha-
</p>
<p>racter and legal knowledge to do so. It was not
</p>
<p>less his duty as a man and as a Christian, than as
</p>
<p>a high officer of the Crown, to give them that ad-
</p>
<p>vice : for, bound as he was to protect the interests
</p>
<p>of the Crow^n, he was not less bound not to exer-
</p>
<p>cise his power in wantonly running down those
</p>
<p>subjects, who were living under its fostering
</p>
<p>care and protection. Made, then, as this request
</p>
<p>had been made to them by the Attorney-Gene-
</p>
<p>ral, he (Mr. Adolphus) could not iielp repeatmg
</p>
<p>it ; for he was well aware how difiicult it w^as to
</p>
<p>dismiss from the mind the impressions of ill-will
</p>
<p>and dislike which were naturally conceived against
</p>
<p>anyone who was, or ever had been, the subject oi'
</p>
<p>general reprobation.

<p>It therefore became them to be doubly on their
</p>
<p>guard, and to view tlie case then under tlicir con-
</p>

<p>upon wjiich, and npon wliicli alone, they were
</p>
<p>sworn to give their verdict. lie agreed with the
</p>
<p>Attorney-Cieneral that the present was a ca.se oi'
</p>
<p>nitinite importance ; not, however, to the })nsoner
</p>
<p>at the bar merely, whose life was at a stake, (in-
</p>
<p>deed in that point oi view it was of less importance
</p>
<p>than in any other) but also to the state and to all
</p>
<p>posterity.
</p>
<p>''It was of importance to the state that verdicts
</p>
<p>should be given upon strict evidence alone, and
</p>
<p>not upon I'avourable or unfavourable impressions
</p>
<p>conceived by the Jury regarding the party on
</p>
<p>his trial. It was of importance also to posterity ;
</p>
<p>because if, as against a bad man, a certain kind
</p>
<p>of evidence should now be aiUnved to procure
</p>
<p>conviction, it would, in time, be also allowed to
</p>
<p>procure conviction against a good one : and, in
</p>
<p>that case nobody could tell whose fame might not
</p>
<p>be impeached, whose property might not be
</p>
<p>injured, whose life might not be destroyed, by
</p>
<p>the same kind of evidence as had been produced
</p>
<p>on this trial; evidence wdiich ought never to have
</p>
<p>the credence of any jury, or the sanction of any
</p>
<p>court.
</p>
<p>" It was not, therefore, so much for the value oi
</p>
<p>Tliistlewood's life (though God forbid that he
</p>
<p>.should undervalue the lil'e of any man) as for the
</p>
<p>value of a precedent in a case of treason, that he
</p>
<p>was then contending ; for if a charge of high
</p>
<p>treason could be substantiated against any Bri-
</p>
<p>tish subject on such evidence as liad just been ad-
</p>
<p>duced there w(juld be an end to all our well-founded

<p>boasts of the excellence oi our law regarding high

</p>
<p>legislature, and with what caution executed by

<p>juries, with some few exceptions, and those in bad
</p>
<p>times, mmecessary or uncalled-for.
</p>
<p>" An accusation of high treason was a fearful
</p>
<p>accusation. In all other criminal cases, from a
</p>
<p>simple assault up to a murder, the King though
</p>
<p>not the real, was the ostensible prosecutor: in a
</p>
<p>case of high treason, however, the King was not
</p>
<p>merel)^ the ostensible but also the real prosecutor ;
</p>
<p>he was directly arrayed against the prisoner, and
</p>
<p>therefore it was the imperative duty of the Jury
</p>
<p>to see that the subject was not oppressed. The
</p>
<p>present case of high treason was as important as
</p>
<p>any of those which had ever preceded it; and the
</p>
<p>Jury ought, therefore, to be peculiarly careful
</p>
<p>not to allow one tittle of evidence to weigh with
</p>
<p>them which had not been admitted on former oc-
</p>
<p>casions, and, if they had any doubts with regard
</p>
<p>to its admissibility, ought to lean to the prisoner,
</p>
<p>and not to the Crown, however interested they
</p>
<p>might be in its preservation, and the preservation
</p>
<p>of its authority.
</p>
<p>" He had before had occasion to state to them,
</p>
<p>that the defence of the prisoner at the bar had
</p>
<p>come to him, in the course of his professional
</p>
<p>business, as an enforced duty. He had not sought
</p>
<p>it; he had not refused it; indeed, as an advocate, he
</p>
<p>could do neither one nor the other. Standing,
</p>
<p>however, as he did, in that Court, as the advocate,
</p>
<p>the unfee'd, and therefore, in some respect, the
</p>
<p>voluntary advocate of the prisoner Thistlewood,
</p>
<p>he deemed it right (unnecessary and improper as
</p>
<p>it might be on any other occasion for an advocate
</p>
<p>to press his own political opinions on the Jury)
</p>
<p>to state that, daring the whole of his life he

<p>had never given his assent to any proposition tend-
</p>
<p>ing to change the constitution, as established at
</p>
<p>the Revolution, either in church or state. He
</p>
<p>had been born a subject of his late most gracious
</p>
<p>Majesty ; to him, whilst alive, he had paid a
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF THISTLEWOOD. 201
</p>
<p>subject's loyal obedience. He was now a subject
</p>
<p>of his present most gracious Majesty, and the
</p>
<p>allegiance which he had paid to the father he
</p>
<p>willingly transferred, as his due to the son.
</p>
<p>'* To the questions which had lately agitated
</p>
<p>the country, he had never lent himself for a
</p>
<p>single moment ; on the contrary, he had always
</p>
<p>opposed, to the utmost of his power, every de-
</p>
<p>sign of faction and innovation. Thus much he
</p>
<p>thought it necessary to state in the peculiar
</p>
<p>situation in which he stood ; but making as he
</p>
<p>had that declaration of his political principles, he
</p>
<p>also felt, both as a man and as an Englishman,
</p>
<p>that he had a strong principle to advance and es-
</p>
<p>tablish in this defence ; and he therefore trusted
</p>
<p>that, if any persons were present who felt an in-
</p>
<p>terest in the fate of the prisoner, they would not
</p>
<p>think that he would relax, in his eiforts on his
</p>
<p>(Thistlewood's) behalf, on account of the differ-
</p>
<p>ence of their political opinions. If any thought
</p>
<p>that he would relax, he was sorry that they
</p>
<p>should entertain such an opinion of him: he would,
</p>
<p>however, use every exertion to make a fair defence
</p>
<p>for the prisoner : if it were not conducted with
</p>
<p>ability, it would be not from want of intention,
</p>
<p>but from want of ability, which would be the
</p>
<p>prisoners misfortune as well as his own.
</p>
<p>" The learned Counsel then proceeded to ob-
</p>
<p>serve, that the line of defence which he found it
</p>
<p>necessary to pursue was the most difficult which
</p>
<p>it had ever fallen to the lot of an advocate to
</p>
<p>make good ; and he should here be deficient in
</p>
<p>respect to the good sense and talent of the jury,
</p>
<p>if he pretended to assert that the prisoner at

<p>the bar was perfectly guiltless. He was afraid
</p>
<p>that it was but too evident that he (Tliistlewood)
</p>
<p>and those with whom he was connected had medi-
</p>
<p>tated assassination, a crime which was little less
</p>
<p>horrible than the commission of it. He did not

<p>202 CATO-STREET CONsPinACV.
</p>
<p>intend to palliate Thistle wood's conduct in doing
</p>
<p>so  far from it : it was a crime not to he pal-
</p>
<p>liated : the very blood recoiled from it  the best
</p>
<p>feelings of human nature revolted against it, and
</p>
<p>the indignation and execration of society always
</p>
<p>followed it. Still he thought it possible that
</p>
<p>Thistlewood, though he might be guilty of mur-
</p>
<p>der and the other crimes imputed to him in the
</p>
<p>various [indictments, might not be guilty of high
</p>
<p>treason. Unless, therefore, he was fully and
</p>
<p>clearlyj proved to be so, it was their duty to ac-
</p>
<p>quit him ; and in so acquitting him, in spite of all
</p>
<p>the odium and prejudice which surrounded him,
</p>
<p>they would be doing honour to themselves, and
</p>
<p>benefit to their posterity.
</p>
<p>" He was not weak enough to say this in
</p>
<p>any hope that, by flattering them, he should obtain
</p>
<p>their verdict ; he should be sorry to obtain it
</p>
<p>on such terms; for if they gave a verdict for
</p>
<p>him against the evidence, they would be doing
</p>
<p>no honour to themselves, and a great injury to
</p>
<p>their posterity. He had once thought of stating
</p>
<p>to them, at some length, the nature of the law
</p>
<p>of treason, but he had afterwards found reason to
</p>
<p>change his opinion, it having been suggested to
</p>
<p>him that the law on that subject would come bet-
</p>
<p>ter to them from the Court. IJe should therefore
</p>
<p>proceed, before he entered into a minute examina-
</p>
<p>tion of the evidence (on the general nature of it he
</p>
<p>had already made some comments) to state to
</p>
<p>them the nature of the indictment.
</p>
<p>" They had heard the indictment read over
</p>
<p>to them, and would have perceived, unacquainted
</p>
<p>as they were with the technicalities of the law,

<p>that the same offence was charged against the
</p>
<p>prisoner, though somewhat varied in terms. There
</p>
<p>were lour cliarges, or counts, to which he parti-
</p>
<p>cularly wished to call their attention ; there were
</p>
<p>to each of these ten or eleven overt acts, nil of
</p>
<p>TRIAL or Til IS I LEW OOD. li03
</p>
<p>which, It had been said, must be considered as
</p>
<p>shewing the intention with which the prisoner had
</p>
<p>acted.
</p>
<p>" The prisoner was cliarucd, in the first count,
</p>
<p>with " compassing, imagining, inventing, devis-
</p>
<p>ing, and intending to deprive and depose our
</p>
<p>Lord the King, from tlie style, honour, and kingly
</p>
<p>name of the imperial crown of this realm.'' The
</p>
<p>overt acts stated in the indictment were, con-
</p>
<p>s})iring to assassinate several of the Privy-Council;
</p>
<p>procuring large quantities of arms with intent to
</p>
<p>assassinate them ; as also to subvert and destroy
</p>
<p>the constitution as by law established; issuing
</p>
<p>proclamations to the King's subjects containing
</p>
<p>solicitations to aid and assist them in makimir
</p>
<p>and levying insurrection; and various other acts
</p>
<p>specified therein. Before, however, they found
</p>
<p>the prisoner guilty upon this count; they ought to
</p>
<p>be convinced that 'the intention to depose the
</p>
<p>King existed previously, and not subsequently,
</p>
<p>to the commission of these overt acts. For though
</p>
<p>they should be perfectly convinced that the pri-
</p>
<p>soner had gone to Lord Harrowby's house with
</p>
<p>the intention of killing the King's ministers, that
</p>
<p>fact alone did not render him guilty of high
</p>
<p>treason : it was necessary that a treasonable inten-
</p>
<p>tion should be first proved to exist.
</p>
<p>" To meditate the assassination of a privy-
</p>
<p>cmmcillor v/as certainly a crime of great magni-
</p>
<p>tude, and by 3 Ilcn. VIL cap. 14., had been made
</p>
<p>a felony ; and by a later statute, that of 9th
</p>

</p>
<p>in the execution of his otHce was made a felony,

<p>to kill a privy-councillor was not in itself an act
</p>
<p>of high treason, unless it were coupled with other
</p>
<p>acts tending to prove a treasonable intention pre-
</p>
<p>viously existing in the mind of the ])risoner. They

</p>
<p>these four points : either that he did intend to de-
</p>
<p>prive and depose our Lord the King from the
</p>
<p>style, honour, and kingly name of the imperial
</p>
<p>crown of this realm ; or that he did intend to ex-
</p>
<p>cite rebellion and insurrection within this realm,
</p>
<p>in order to subvert the government ; or that he
</p>
<p>did intend to levy war against the King, in
</p>
<p>order, by force and restraint, to compel him to
</p>
<p>change his measures and councils ; or that he did
</p>
<p>intend, with force and arms, to effect those pur-
</p>
<p>poses.
</p>
<p>'* These were the points which must be esta-
</p>
<p>blished before they could find the prisoner at the
</p>
<p>bar guilty of high treason ; and what was the
</p>
<p>evidence produced to establish them? He did
</p>
<p>not hesitate to affirm, that never was evidence so
</p>
<p>weak tendered to prove charges so heinous. It
</p>
<p>was contradictory, it was inadmissible, it was
</p>
<p>incredible, coming from any quarter, but still
</p>
<p>more incredible, coming, as it did, from men
</p>
<p>destitute of all character, avowedly engaged in
</p>
<p>a conspiracy to effect a hideous murder, and
</p>
<p>therefore men of such a description as ought
</p>
<p>never to be allowed by their oaths to bring the
</p>
<p>life of man into danger at all. Before he proceeded
</p>
<p>any further, it would be requisite to call their
</p>
<p>attention to the degree of credit which ought to
</p>
<p>belong to an accomplice. The Attorney-General,
</p>
<p>in calling an accomplice as witness, had stated
</p>
<p>that he was to be believed, whenever he was
</p>
<p>supported by other collateral evidence. On this
</p>
<p>doctrine he would not comment just at present,
</p>
<p>but would content himself with observing, that
</p>
<p>it must be clear to all of them that the whole

</p>
<p>charge of high treason rested in this case solely
</p>
<p>on the evidence of an accomplice. For if the
</p>
<p>testimony of Adams were to be dismissed from
</p>
<p>their notice, there was not a single syllable said
</p>
<p>by all the other witnesses who had been pro-
</p>
<p>duced, (so loosely indeed had they supported the
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF THISTLEWOOD. '205
</p>
<p>testimony of Adams) tending to convict Thistle-
</p>
<p>wood of high treason.
</p>
<p>" The question then came to this point, whether
</p>
<p>a charge of high treason ought to be considered
</p>
<p>as made out, which rested solely on the testimony
</p>
<p>of an accomplice, and an accomplice, too, like
</p>
<p>Adams. He maintained that it ought not, for if
</p>
<p>Adams were believed, no witness could hereafter
</p>
<p>be rejected as unworthy of credit, and conse-
</p>
<p>quently no man's life or honour could be consi-
</p>
<p>dered secure. " An accomplice," however, con-
</p>
<p>tinued the Attorney-General, not indeed in thos(3
</p>
<p>very words, but in words to that effect, " ought
</p>
<p>not to be expected to receive support on every
</p>
<p>point which he mentions in evidence, because if
</p>
<p>he were to receive such support, there would be
</p>
<p>nq reason to call him at all."
</p>
<p>" It was true that the evidence of an accom-
</p>
<p>plice might be believed under certain circum-
</p>
<p>stances, that is, when he was supported by otlier
</p>
<p>more respectable witnesses ; but then he must
</p>
<p>not be supported by only a few witnesses, but by
</p>
<p>all the witnesses which could be called to confront
</p>
<p>him. He would even go so far as to say that
</p>
<p>those who availed themselves of the evidence of
</p>
<p>an accomplice were bound to produce every
</p>
<p>witness acquainted with the facts to which he
</p>
<p>swore, not merely those who could support, but
</p>
<p>even those who were likely to contradict them.
</p>
<p>These persons were the solemn gages of his
</p>
<p>truth, and like witnesses to the signature of deeds,
</p>
<p>ought to be culled forward for the common good
</p>
<p>of all parties. This was not merely his opinion,
</p>
<p>but the opinion of many eminent lawyers who

</p>
<p>had gone before him. Indeed he had read an
</p>
<p>opinion of one of them in a book, which he could
</p>
<p>not with propriety mention there ; an opinion
</p>
<p>which was so much in unison with his own, though
</p>
<p>much more forcibly expressed, that he could not
</p>
<p>omit the opportunity oi' reading it to thcni. The
</p>
<p>200 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>argument in it was clear and satisfactory, and the
</p>
<p>law was not more accurately laid down than it
</p>
<p>was forcibly expressed. The passage to which
</p>
<p>he alluded was as follows :
</p>
<p>" * An accomplice may be a witness ; even uncon-
</p>
<p>firmed, he is a witness competent to be heard/  A
</p>
<p>witness of the most infamous character, unless he
</p>
<p>has been actually convicted of certain specific
</p>
<p>crimes, and the record is brought into Court, may
</p>
<p>indeed be heard ; but it is for you, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>to determine what degree of credit you will give
</p>
<p>to his evidence. Let him be heard ; let him be
</p>
<p>examined ; I thank them for calling this witness :
</p>
<p>I thank them for submitting him to the admirable
</p>
<p>cross-examination of my learned friend : 1 thank
</p>
<p>them for stopping certain subjects of inquiry ;
</p>
<p>all this must satisfy you, that no reliance can be
</p>
<p>placed upon his testimony. I am sure, that if
</p>
<p>this were a case not of the immense importance
</p>
<p>which it is ; but if it were a suit instituted to
</p>
<p>decide the smallest question of civil right, that
</p>
<p>you would not attend or give the slightest
</p>
<p>credence to such evidence. But in a case of this
</p>
<p>nature and of this magnitude, in a criminal case,
</p>
<p>in a case of treason, in a case of the highest
</p>
<p>description of crime, and, with respect to its
</p>
<p>inflictions and penalties, the severest that the law
</p>
<p>recognizes ; in a case of high treason, I say, to
</p>
<p>build your decision upon evidence of this cha-
</p>
<p>racter, upon such a witness, and such a treacherous
</p>
<p>loundation, is it possible that my friends on the
</p>
<p>other side can expect it ; is it possible that they
</p>
<p>can hope, or even wish for it ? Can you believe
</p>
<p>tliat they could have known the previous conduct

<p>and character of this man, when they brought
</p>
<p>him into Court ? It would be an insult to your

<p>understandings ; it would be an outrage to

<p>common sense; a mockery of justice, to sujipose

<p>that the smallest degree of reliance can be placed

<p>" But it is said that he is confirmed ; and
</p>
<p>because he is confirmed in some facts, you are
</p>
<p>therefore to believe him in the rest. This is a
</p>
<p>position which lawyers are in the habit of stating
</p>
<p>in a very unqualified manner; but it is not a
</p>
<p>position which can be maintained to this extent,
</p>
<p>according to any principle of common sense.
</p>
<p>There is no man who tells a long and complicated
</p>
<p>story, like that which you have heard, who
</p>
<p>may, and must not of necessity, be confirmed in
</p>
<p>many parts of it. The witness was upwards of
</p>
<p>eight hours in giving his evidence, and of course
</p>
<p>stated many facts, which no man denies, which
</p>
<p>have been in all the newspapers for weeks and for
</p>
<p>months past ; and because he is confirmed in
</p>
<p>certain particulars, you are therefore required
</p>
<p>to believe the whole of his story to be true. Is
</p>
<p>this a proposition to be insisted upon ? Can it
</p>
<p>for a moment be maintained to this extent, and
</p>
<p>in this broad and unqualified way? But, gentle-
</p>
<p>men, every profession and science has its phrases ;
</p>
<p>the necessary qualifications are by degrees lost
</p>
<p>sight of, and the worst errors are thus intro-
</p>
<p>duced.
</p>
<p>"Let us then look at the mischief of this doc-
</p>

</p>
<p>arisen out of it. The notorious Titus Gates,
</p>
<p>the witness for the Crown in the trials founded

</p>
<p>times of heat and party animosity, were prevailed
</p>
<p>upon to believe him, and many unhappy persons
</p>
<p>sufiered in consequence of the extreme punish-

</p>
<p>reliance placed upon the frail and fallacious testi-
</p>
<p>mony of a man of that description. You perceive,
</p>
<p>then, gentlemen, the danger of this doctrine ; and
</p>
<p>that it is not because a man is confirmed in
</p>
<p>certain circumstances that you can safely believe
</p>
<p>him, as to other facts where that confirmation is
</p>
<p>wanting.
</p>
<p>" What is the character of falsehood ? Who
</p>
<p>has lived in the world, and has at all examined
</p>
<p>the operations of the human heart and mind, who
</p>
<p>does not know that this is the usual and proper
</p>
<p>character of falsehood  that it does not wholly
</p>
<p>invent, falsehood engrafts itself upon truth, and
</p>
<p>by that artifice misleads and deceives, truth is
</p>
<p>exaggerated, things that exist are discoloured
</p>
<p>or distorted  these are the usual operations of
</p>
<p>falsehood; this is a part of its nature, its address
</p>
<p>and dexterity. It arises, therefore, out of the
</p>
<p>very nature of perjury, that it must be confirmed
</p>
<p>to a certain extent; and it is because there is
</p>
<p>confirmation in certain particulars, to which par-
</p>
<p>ticulars I shall, by-and-by, take the liberty of
</p>
<p>drawing your attention, that you are gravely re-
</p>
<p>quired to believe the whole of the miserable
</p>
<p>fictions with which you have been insulted in the
</p>
<p>evidence of this abandoned wretch.
</p>
<p>** But let us look with a little more accuracy to
</p>
<p>the shades and distinctions upon this material
</p>
<p>point. I beg you to follow me ; for it is most im-
</p>
<p>portant, according to my apprehension of the
</p>
<p>question. A man may be seduced into the
</p>
<p>commission of an off'ence, who had previously
</p>
<p>maintained a good character ; he may repent of

<p>to enlarge his mind by the infusion of good sound

<p>not have given him any sentences so adecpaate to
</p>
<p>the expression of the sentiments which he wished

<p>to convey to the Jury, as were the sentences which
</p>
<p>he had just read to them. He could have wished

<p>to have given them the book which contained these

<p>sentences to keep in the box with them, but the

<p>practice of the Court prevented him from doing

<p>of protection for the prisoner, against a man,

<p>he was going to make. He thought it, therefore,
</p>
<p>his duty, to say at once, that ikj doubt could be
</p>
<p>entertained of Thistlewood having been at a meet-
</p>
<p>ing in Cato-street, and that he, with the other

<p>members of that meeting, Ivad determined to

</p>
<p>doubt of the existence of the meeting, or the

<p>sanguinary desig-ns which those who attended it
</p>
<p>entertained, would be full as absurd as to doubt
</p>
<p>the existence of light now that the sun was casting-
</p>
<p>its full radiance upon the Court. Whilst that
</p>
<p>meeting was in deep deliberation, it was inter-
</p>
<p>rupted by the arrival of a party of police otticers.
</p>
<p>In the affray which ensued, Smithers met his
</p>
<p>death, or, he ought rather to s})eak out plainly,
</p>
<p>was murdered.
</p>
<p>" Making, however, these concessions, and ad-
</p>
<p>mitting the facts to be as bad as bad could be
</p>
<p>against the prisoner at the bar, believing even, as
</p>
<p>he did beUeve, that Thistlewood was guilty of
</p>
<p>the murder of Smithers, still he maintained that
</p>
<p>his guilt did not amount to high treason. lie
</p>
<p>would admit, that from motives of a personal
</p>
<p>nature, Thistlewood wished to kill one of his
</p>
<p>Majesty's ministers ; and that, in order to eflPect
</p>
<p>that purpose, he had no objection to kill them all.
</p>
<p>The Jury ought, however, to recollect that, whilst
</p>
<p>influenced by this wish, he had always been
</p>
<p>accompanied by two spies : how far they had
</p>
<p>advised these plots was not clear, but one thing
</p>
<p>was clear, that, upon such evidence as theirs, they
</p>
<p>were called upon to convict Thistlewood of high
</p>
<p>treason. That he had been guilty of murder he
</p>
<p>(Mr. Adol[)lius) was not now going to dispute;
</p>
<p>but it was too bad that the crimes of murder and
</p>
<p>treason should now be blended together, and that

</p>
<p>" What then was the testimony wliicli Mr
</p>
<p>Robert Adams liad given to them? lie (Mr.
</p>
<p>Adolphus) would tell them. The man had com-
</p>
<p>menced his evidence by informing- them, that he

<p>had ])een a .soldier some years in tlie iUues. 'J'hat
</p>
<p>any subject of the King should entertain such
</p>
<p>schemes as had been entertained by tiu^se
</p>
<p>alleged conspirators, was eertainly dephjrable ;
</p>
<p>but that a man in the situation of Adams, a soldier,
</p>
<p>sworn to defend his Majesty to the best of his
</p>
<p>ability from all harm and danger, should have
</p>
<p>voluntarily entered into them, and should never
</p>
<p>have i'elt any of what he (Adams) had termed
</p>
<p>compunctious visitings as to the guilt in which he
</p>
<p>was going to involve himself, until four days
</p>
<p>after the execution of that guilt had been rendered
</p>
<p>impossible, was a circumstance so atrocious as to
</p>
<p>dej)rive him of all claim to credibility and res])ect.
</p>
<p>" This loyal soldier, however, ])roceeded to in-
</p>
<p>form them, that he had become ac(|uainted with

</p>
<p>for some time, but afterwards met him again in

<p>the month of January last, when Brunt introduced

<p>him to Thistlewood. 'I'hen occurred one of the

<p>most extraordinary circumstances which he (Mr.

</p>
<p>to be nothing else than the fashion throughout the
</p>
<p>whole of this case. At his very first meeting
</p>
<p>with this Mr. Adams, Thistlewood let him into
</p>
<p>the whole secret of his traitorous designs. But
</p>
<p>could any one believe that Thistlewood himself
</p>
<p>was so reckless of life, as to use language to a
</p>
<p>stranger equivalent to this ?  ' My fate is so hard,
</p>
<p>my circumstances are so desperate, that I care not
</p>
<p>a straw what becomes of me. I put myself, and
</p>
<p>all my designs, into your hands, without any re-
</p>
<p>gard to the consequences ; and yet those designs
</p>
<p>are so horrible and so sanguinary, that if you have
</p>
<p>the slightest portion of loyal feeling about you,
</p>
<p>you must denounce me to Government, you must
</p>
<p>hand me over to justice, you must embrace the
</p>
<p>opportunity which 1 have given you of condemn-
</p>
<p>ing me, without any scruple, out of my own
</p>
<p>mouth.' Was it possible that any man in his
</p>
<p>senses could be thus blind and foolish ? Could
</p>
<p>the most credulous man alive be persuaded to
</p>
<p>attach credit to so incredible a story ? He thought
</p>
<p>not ; and he therefore trusted, that on such evi-
</p>
<p>dence, they would never find the prisoner guilty
</p>
<p>of high treason.
</p>
<p>" But though the prisoner, and those with
</p>
<p>whom he was connected, had not meditated so
</p>
<p>great a crime as treason, the evidence inclined
</p>
<p>him to believe, that after the perpetration of the
</p>
<p>bloody deeds which they meditated, they had in-
</p>
<p>tended, under shelter of the confusion which such
</p>
<p>atrocities would have created, to have commenced
</p>
<p>a general plunder and devastation of the metro-
</p>
<p>polis. Such an intention, though it enhanced their
</p>
<p>guilt, did not make it amount to high treason ;

<p>and, indeed, any j)erson who carefully perused
</p>
<p>the evidence, would observe that it tallied well
</p>
<p>throughout with a design to plunder, but very ill
</p>
<p>indeed with a design to depose the King and
</p>
<p>to alter the form of Government. For wiiat was
</p>
<p>it that Mr. Adams next said? Why, after some
</p>
<p>TRIAL OP TIIISTLEWOOD. '2 \ S
</p>
<p>conversation as to his excellence as a swordsman,
</p>
<p>Thistlewood is represented as saying, ' iSo man
</p>
<p>worth 10/. was worth any thing for the good of his
</p>
<p>country. The tradesmen and shopkeepers of
</p>
<p>London were a set of aristocrats together, and all
</p>
<p>worked under the same system of government.
</p>
<p>He should like to see the day when all the shops
</p>
<p>should be shut uj) and well plundered.' Why,
</p>
<p>the whole intent of their conspiracy was disclosed
</p>
<p>in this sentence. Here was nothing about de-
</p>
<p>priving the King of his style and dignity ; but
</p>
<p>there was a good deal about plundering the city.
</p>
<p>Their arms, too, were fitted for this purpose, but
</p>
<p>not for overturning the Government, as must have
</p>
<p>been evident to all, from the miserable display of
</p>
<p>their armory which had been so ostentatiously
</p>
<p>made on the preceding evening. Therefore, unless
</p>
<p>they could suppose, that to murder the man
</p>
<p>whom they hated, and to plunder the shops during
</p>
<p>the trepidation ensuhig on such murder, amounted
</p>
<p>to a deposing of the King, they must acquit This-
</p>
<p>tlewood of high treason.
</p>
<p>" At another meeting, this formidable band
</p>
<p>of traitors declared that they Avere so poor,
</p>
<p>that they could not wait longer than the en-
</p>
<p>suing Wednesday for the effecting of their in-
</p>
<p>tended revolution. He left it to the jury to say,
</p>
<p>whether such a declaration savoured more of
</p>
<p>plunder or of high treason. But, in his opinion,
</p>
<p>a scheme of plunder was the only thing which
</p>
<p>could be thus easily arranged ; not a revolution
</p>
<p>in the state, which must depend upon many for-
</p>

<p>guished noblemen; how justly it was not their

<p>13th oi January, just one month and ten days
</p>
<p>before the transaction in Cato-street. M hat occur-
</p>
<p>red next, according to the testimony of the

<p>214 CATO-STRKKT CONSPIRACY,
</p>
<p>respectable Mr. Adams ? Wliy, that three days
</p>
<p>afterwards he was himself arrested for a small
</p>
<p>debt, and carried to Whitecross-street prison,
</p>
<p>which residence he did not leave until the 30th of
</p>
<p>January. Was this man, who could not even pre-
</p>
<p>serve his liberty, more likely to be found engaged
</p>
<p>in a design to destroy the state, or in a design
</p>
<p>to commit pillage and plunder, to enrich himself?
</p>
<p>He had nothing to lose, he had every thing to
</p>
<p>gain ; and if the worst came to the worst, he lind
</p>
<p>only to save himself, and hang the rest of his
</p>
<p>companions, by turning King's evidence against
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>" After Adams had got out of prison, he re-
</p>
<p>turned to his old friends, and had several con-
</p>
<p>versations with them, at all of which Edwards
</p>
<p>was present. He wished to call their attention
</p>
<p>to this curious fact, that Edwards, who could
</p>
<p>have proved all the conversations which had
</p>
<p>taken place  Edwards, whose name was placed
</p>
<p>on the back of the indictment as a witness to be
</p>
<p>summoned on behalf of the Crown, had never
</p>
<p>once been put into the box. Shortly afterwards
</p>
<p>they took a room to themselves, and had meet-
</p>
<p>ings in it twice or thrice every day. Adams
</p>
<p>attended them all, became acquainted with all
</p>
<p>their projects, made himself an active partner to
</p>
<p>all their intended atrocities'; and yet, though a
</p>
<p>soldier of the King's, never disclosed a syllable of
</p>
<p>them to any of the constituted authorities until
</p>
<p>he was apprehended. What next ? Why, between
</p>
<p>the 3d and the 16th of February, another conver-
</p>
<p>sation occurred ; and then this plot is described as

<p>' One evening,' says this respectable witness, ' 1
</p>
<p>went in and saw Harrison, Thistlewood and
</p>
<p>Brunt: Harrison said, that he had been speaking
</p>
<p>to one of the horse-guards, who had told him
</p>
<p>that the whole of their regiment would be down
</p>
<p>at Windsor on the King's funeral. He said that

<p>TRIAL Ol' THISTI.EWOOI). 215
</p>
<p>this would be a favourable opportunity to kick up
</p>
<p>a row, and to see what could be done.' Kick up
</p>
<p>a row ! That very phrase explained the whole
</p>
<p>matter  all the troops would not, indeed, be out
</p>
<p>of town, but all the othcers of police would, and
</p>
<p>therefore it was a favourable opportunity to kick
</p>
<p>up a row, and to commit depredation. * This-
</p>
<p>tlewood' continued Mr. Adams, ' said that it was
</p>
<p>a good plan ; and, added, that if they could get
</p>
<p>the two pieces of cannon in Gray's Tnn-lane, and
</p>
<p>the six pieces in the Artillery-ground, they would
</p>
<p>so help themselves as to have possession of Lon-
</p>
<p>don before morning. He also said, that when the
</p>
<p>news should reach Windsor, the soldiers would be
</p>
<p>so tired from being up all night, as to be incapa-
</p>
<p>ble of doing any thing when they returned to
</p>

</p>
<p>lellow, with his military education, ought to have
</p>
<p>known that he could not take military possession
</p>
<p>of any single respectable street in the metropolis

<p>with ten times the number of men said to be en-
</p>

</p>
<p>devised such a plan, might, indeed, be considered
</p>
<p>as mad  but at least there was method in his
</p>
<p>madness. Roads were to be commanded in this,
</p>
<p>important diversions operated in that direction,
</p>
<p>telegraphs to be seized in one town, and soldiers
</p>
<p>paralyzed in another. All this, too, was to be

<p>done by twenty-five men and eight pieces of artil-

</p>
<p>than he could ever be induced to credit. For

<p>no story of oriental romance was so extravagant

</p>
<p>the poor soldiers to deatli ])y the labours of
</p>
<p>one niii^ht, it was quite clear that Adams, with
</p>
<p>all his military education, had either never heard
</p>
<p>of such a thing as a bivouac, or else that he had
</p>
<p>conceived all virtue and all valour, as well as
</p>
<p>all honesty, to have left the army when he quitted
</p>
<p>it. The })rovisional government being formed,
</p>
<p>it was only natural to expect that the business of
</p>
<p>the drama would crowd more thickly upon the
</p>
<p>Jury, and therefore they might be excused for
</p>
<p>asking what came next. Why, the provisional
</p>
<p>government was to send to the sea-ports to pre-
</p>
<p>vent any gentlemen from leaving England without
</p>
<p>passports : it was to send to Dover, to Brighton,
</p>
<p>to Margate, to Ramsgate, and other places, orders
</p>
<p>to that effect ; to send to all of them, too, during
</p>
<p>the night of the King's funeral  and, above all,
</p>
<p>w^as to send these orders to Brighton in particu-
</p>
<p>lar. Why so } because the mention of Brighton
</p>
<p>brought the prisoner at the bar into contact with
</p>
<p>the reigning Sovereign, and laid a foundation for
</p>
<p>a charge of high treason.
</p>
<p>"The King, however, was not at that time at
</p>
<p>Brighton, but unfortunately confined to his palace
</p>
<p>in London by so severe an indisposition as to
</p>
<p>require the issuing of daily bulletins regarding
</p>
<p>the state of his health. From that indisposition
</p>
<p>he had now recovered, and he (Mr. Adolphus)
</p>
<p>prayed to God that he might long be preserved
</p>
<p>from the recurrence of it. The prisoner at the
</p>
<p>bar, however, if they were to believe the testi-
</p>
<p>mony of Adams, was of opinion, that the present
</p>
<p>family had inherited the throne long enough, and
</p>
<p>that it was of no use for the present King to

</p>
<p>The learned Counsel proceeded, " Thus, gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen, is the secret detected ! Here is the word

</p>
<p>munication with the country occupied, and the
</p>
<p>sea- port towns seized ! Yet, by this shameless
</p>
<p>fabricator of incredible falsehood, and by him
</p>
<p>alone, is the first count of the indictment sup-
</p>
<p>ported. It required the greatest human fortitude
</p>
<p>of face to state it. Well, it was discovered that
</p>
<p>the first Cabinet dinner was to be given. Cabinet
</p>
<p>dinners were said to be suspended during the
</p>
<p>death of the late King, and the illness of the
</p>
<p>present. On occasion of this first Cabinet dinner
</p>
<p>the plan was to be executed. Mark, now, how
</p>
<p>this story breaks itself to pieces !
</p>
<p>" On the 16th of February the plot is formed ;
</p>
<p>yet then there was no ministry, and no intention
</p>
<p>of a Cabinet dinner. This is flagrant, gross, and
</p>
<p>palpable, too palpable for detection, too flagrant
</p>
<p>for exaggeration. Several meetings are said to
</p>
<p>have been held at Fox's-court. It was found, on
</p>
<p>the 19th February, that the soldiers had done
</p>
<p>their duty, and were not to be surprised, there-
</p>
<p>fore something new must be devised. For this
</p>
<p>purpose comes the ever memorable information
</p>
<p>in The New Times. They had nothing in view
</p>
<p>but plunder ; they sought only the surest way to
</p>
<p>plunder. Poverty was their goad, plunder their
</p>
<p>aim. Their designs were not directed against
</p>
<p>any individuals, however exalted, but as means
</p>
<p>of plunder. But a committee was appointed,
</p>
<p>and we see them assembled on the 20th. This
</p>
<p>is eminently worthy of your attention. On
</p>
<p>Sunday, at eleven o'clock in the morning, when
</p>
<p>the snow fell so thick that one could scarcely see
</p>
<p>his way, the committee met. Tidd took the
</p>
<p>chair at this rehearsal of the provisional govern-

<p>ment. Tidd sat in the chair with a pike in his
</p>
<p>hand. Thistlewood took his station on his right ;
</p>
<p>Brunt was on the left ; Thistlewood opens:  ' f
</p>
<p>presume you know what you have met here for;
</p>
<p>I mean the west-end job.' This is presumptuous
</p>
<p>enough, certainly. Brunt speaks next : he never
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF THI5TLEWOOD. 219
</p>
<p>speaks without an oath, and he, characteristically,
</p>
<p>says, ' D  n my eyes, mention it out.' Tidd
</p>
<p>calls to order. So orderly was this meeting !
</p>
<p>Thistlewood then proposes to assassinate the
</p>
<p>ministers separately, as they cannot be got to-
</p>
<p>gether.
</p>
<p>" Their arrangements for this are like all the
</p>
<p>other arrangements ; barracks were to be taken,
</p>
<p>cannons carried away, ministers assassinated,
</p>
<p>government subverted, the Mansion House occu-
</p>
<p>pied, all by fifteen or twenty men. Twenty-five
</p>
<p>were the greatest number ever spoken to.
</p>
<p>Twenty-five would find themselves completely
</p>
<p>lost in the Mansion House ; they might as well
</p>
<p>wander through the Tower of Babel. Palin, who
</p>
<p>was to be particularly imi)ortani in his services,
</p>
<p>was to travel from place to place with satchels
</p>
<p>of burning materials on his back, and was alone
</p>
<p>to set fire to several places. IVIr. Palin alone was
</p>
<p>to be seen wandering about, setting fire to houses
</p>
<p>for anuisement, or for the })erfection of their
</p>
<p>plan. Each individual was to have his distinct
</p>
<p>act of assassination ; whoever failed was to be
</p>
<p>himself assassinated. But who the spare assassin
</p>
<p>was, to assassinate the rest if they failed, was
</p>
<p>not told. But this is one of the many fictions
</p>
<p>which you are called upon to swallow.
</p>
<p>" The witness ventured, for the first time, to
</p>
<p>express here some difficulty, and asked whether,
</p>
<p>if failure proceeded from unavoidable causes, and
</p>
<p>not from cowardice, the same consec{uence must
</p>
<p>follow\ 'I'histlewood relieved him from this
</p>
<p>apprehension. But how the court-martial was to
</p>
<p>be fijrmed to try the case was not discovered.

</p>
<p>Such, gentlemen, is the delirium of delusion, or
</p>
<p>the suggestions of freirzy, which you are called
</p>
<p>upon to believe. Mr. Palin delivers a speech in
</p>
<p>parliamentary form. ' Agreeing as 1 do with
</p>
<p>the plan proposed, 1 wish to know where men
</p>
<p>are to be found.' 'ilien he asks whether the

<p>2t2
</p>
<p>'i'iO CATO-STllEET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>plan is to be communicated to those he meant
</p>
<p>to call upon. Thistlewood authorizes him to use
</p>
<p>his own discretion. Gentlemen, if you find in
</p>
<p>this testimony some remote pointing to proba-
</p>
<p>bihty, believe it; but can you, for a moment,
</p>
<p>hesitate respecting this gross and flagrant fiction ?
</p>
<p>Furnival's Inn was selected for setting fire to.
</p>
<p>No building is less liable to be burnt. It is a
</p>
<p>modern building, and there are strong party- walls.
</p>
<p>Other places, which I shall not name, and where
</p>
<p>some of us live, would be much fitter. Many
</p>
<p>places between Furnivars Inn and Fetter-lane,
</p>
<p>all timber, would take fire at once. ButFurnivaFs
</p>
<p>Inn appeared fittest in fiction.
</p>
<p>" The witness had been in prison, and having
</p>
<p>forgotten that Furnival's Inn was rebuilt, and
</p>
<p>inventing what he should say to the Privy-Council,
</p>
<p>he represented Furnival's Inn as the place to be
</p>
<p>burnt, because, in its former state, it would
</p>
<p>readily take fire. The Privy Council, their clerk,
</p>
<p>as well as the Attorney General, I believe, gave
</p>
<p>him no assistance ; they only placed him before
</p>
<p>an impartial jury. You know that if the plan were
</p>
<p>contemplated and effected, a chandler's shop at
</p>
<p>Charing-cross, where the various communications
</p>
<p>diverge into the town, would create more alarm.
</p>
<p>But this suited the grossness of fiction, or the fond-
</p>
<p>ness of delusion, by which this witness looked for
</p>
<p>impunity and reward. We now come to the busi-
</p>
<p>ness of the exchequer. Brunt says, " D n
</p>
<p>my eyes, though I have not worked for some time,
</p>
<p>I have a 1/. note, and I shall give it for a treat."
</p>
<p>You will not, gentlemen, suppose that I repeat
</p>
<p>these oaths as feeling pleasure in doing so. It is

</p>
<p>])ainful to me, and disgusting to you ; but, in my
</p>
<p>humble judgment, it is not a needless repetition.
</p>
<p>" Suppose Brunt's generous purpose accom-
</p>
<p>plished, it will give a slice of cheese, a piece of
</p>
<p>bread, and a glass of gin to each. It appears
</p>
<p>that 6s. was the largest sum seen with them :

</p>
<p>there was Is. on another occasion ; there was
</p>
<p>7rf. for a newspaper, 75. 7d. was the treasury
</p>
<p>then. Whether this and the prospect of sharing
</p>
<p>in the produce of a 1/. note, could induce fifteen
</p>
<p>men to subvert the Government, 1 leave you to
</p>
<p>judge. Nothing stimulated them, then, but the
</p>
<p>hope of plunder. When they should have done
</p>
<p>something to create alarm, they expected to have
</p>
<p>full liberty of plunder.
</p>
<p>" Thus have I endeavoured, gentlemen, by
</p>
<p>hours stolen from my rest, to lay before you the
</p>
<p>real character of their intentions. My Lord will
</p>
<p>fairly state the law to you; I need not, therefore,
</p>
<p>anticipate any thing on that subject. At the meet-
</p>
<p>ing on the 21st, information is said to have been
</p>
<p>given that their proceedings were known at Bow-
</p>
<p>street, and at the Secretary of State's office.
</p>
<p>We miglit have had evidence whether this infor-
</p>
<p>mation could be well founded, but we have none.
</p>
<p>Next day, the 22d, the cabinet dinner is an-
</p>
<p>nounced. Who announces it? Mr. Edwards.
</p>
<p>This corresponds with what is in evidence before
</p>
<p>you, that the intelligence was fabricated, and put
</p>
<p>into the paper for this purpose. " Poverty goads
</p>
<p>on these men ; it is fit," said the prompters,
</p>
<p>" that we put them on to what will serve our own
</p>
<p>purposes."
</p>
<p>" The Court reporter himself did not know of
</p>
<p>the cabinet dinner. He has told you, that the
</p>
<p>word ' grand ' could not be applied by him, as
</p>
<p>one cabinet dinner was not grander than another.
</p>
<p>You see, then, how it has been fabricated. 1 will
</p>
<p>here once more allude to the execrations oi Brunt,
</p>
<p>and from this time dismiss thom from your ob-

<p>servation.
</p>
<p>" The Attorney General animadverted properly
</p>
<p>on the impiety and obduracy of heart which
</p>
<p>the language of Brunt indicated. If it was true,
</p>
<p>his infamy baffles description. It is, that up to that
</p>
<p>moment he had been an infidel, but he had been
</p>
<p>2^2 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>praying to God, and he now believed, because
</p>
<p>his prayer was answered. Such are the words
</p>
<p>uttered by the fiction-making witness's mouth.
</p>
<p>* 1 have prayed to God, in whom I did not beheve,
</p>
<p>to put in our power innocent men, who are highly
</p>
<p>favoured in this world.' These are the fictions of
</p>
<p>a gross, rank, ignorant, conspirator; they defy
</p>
<p>the grasp of human investigation ; they almost
</p>
<p>persuade us to believe them, because they are
</p>
<p>impossible. We are almost led to say, as one
</p>
<p>said on another occasion, ' I believe it, because
</p>
<p>no man would invent what is so incredible.^ But,
</p>
<p>on a question of life and death, gentlemen, you
</p>
<p>will not listen to such fictions ; you will not re-
</p>
<p>gard such fantastical decoys. Perforated by
</p>
<p>the witness's own act, his creation sinks to the
</p>
<p>bottom of the sea ; it can form neither buoy nor
</p>
<p>vessel  it is sunk and destroyed for ever. But
</p>
<p>he is an infamous witness who cannot be believed
</p>
<p>at all. You find himself next in the chair ; and
</p>
<p>when one turns upon him like a bull-dog, and
</p>
<p>another like a bear, he remains firm.
</p>
<p>" It was then resolved to have a watch set
</p>
<p>upon Lord Harrowby's house. This was certainly
</p>
<p>done, and was a part of the plan which was un-
</p>
<p>doubtedly formed to murder his Majesty's Minis-
</p>
<p>ters. But after that should have been done, so
</p>
<p>barren were they of invention, that they were to
</p>
<p>tall back on their old plan of carrying away can-
</p>
<p>nons without horses ; of occupying posts without
</p>
<p>men ; and of performing great deeds without any
</p>
<p>means.

</p>
<p>mean. A printing press, one would have thought,
</p>
<p>was mdispensable. But no means of printing a

</p>
<p>If this were told by a witness deserving of faith,
</p>
<p>it would stagger belief; told by one tainted as
</p>
<p>this witness is, it can excite no inclination to-
</p>
<p>wards faith. On the blazing building, I think I
</p>
<p>am correct in stating it so, these proclamations
</p>
<p>were to be stuck up, in order that the friends of
</p>
<p>liberty, happening to pass by the ruins, might
</p>
<p>know that a provisional government was sitting,

<p>we know not where, or for what purpose.
</p>
<p>" Is it possible, gentlemen, to sacrifice human
</p>
<p>life upon evidence like this? Is it possible to cre-
</p>
<p>dit evidence that has no point of contact with
</p>
<p>common sense ? The Provisional Government,
</p>
<p>dropped from the clouds, is sitting: the finger-

<p>post is destroyed, with the blazing building to
</p>
<p>which it was attached ; you know not where the

<p>was arrayed in a belt and two bags. The articles

<p>which were exhibited to you last night are re-

<p>carry human heads. If there is in the human

<p>enough to contain a human head. I am told that
</p>
<p>they are : if so, I only say it has the impression

<p>of a hasty view. But, for God's sake, let us not

<p>" The witness says, when the officers entered
</p>
<p>the loft in Cato-street, they cried out, * Here "s a
</p>
<p>pretty nest of you,' &c. I shall afterwards re-
</p>
<p>mark upon this, because I think it pregnant with
</p>
<p>importance as to the witness's testimony, for I
</p>
<p>think he was not there at all. With the experience
</p>
<p>which you have had in courts of justice, some of
</p>
<p>you may have felt astonished that my learned friend
</p>
<p>did not proceed further into the cross-examination
</p>
<p>of this witness. Every art has its own difficulties,
</p>
<p>and my learned friend never shewed more con-

<p>summate skill in his art than when he refrained
</p>
<p>from further cross-examination of this witness.

<p>witness, which were the natural and regular in-

<p>quiries, you heard him refuse to answer, and add,

<p>* No, I have something else to say before I come

<p>to that.' When their experience and judgment

<p>Bnt this important declaration was got from him

<p>words quoted by the Attorney General from a

<p>great })oet, whether he had given inlbrmation from
</p>

</p>
<p>science alone made him disclose what he knew.
</p>
<p>He is quiet from the murder of Smithers on
</p>
<p>Wednesday night till Saturday, when he plumes
</p>
<p>his wings, and goes to the Privy-Council to dis-
</p>
<p>burthen his heart. I have had a good deal of

<p>1 have heard one, who was chairman of the
</p>
<p>quarter-sessions for Middlesex twenty-six years,
</p>
<p>say, tliat, from the moment that observation was
</p>
<p>made by an accomplice, he was not to be believ-
</p>
<p>ed, because that was incredible. Apply that here.
</p>
<p>He sees the murderer, and goes away, unconcern-
</p>
<p>ed as if nothing had happened. He rests on the
</p>
<p>stings of his conscience for ibur days. He nmst

<p>think that you have no hearts yourselves  no

<p>the most important of our Courts, was thus to

</p>
<p>fought at Waterloo (for the Duke of Wellington

<p>" Wiieii the destruction of worth and wisdom,
</p>
<p>of learning and talent, is thus contemplated, the
</p>
<p>most hardened and flinty heart that ever dwelt in
</p>
<p>a. human bosom recoils with horror, and melts
</p>
<p>with compassion.
</p>
<p>" If then, I have used a light expression, im-
</p>
<p>pute it, gentlemen, to inadvertence of language,
</p>
<p>and not to hardness of heart, because the absurdity
</p>
<p>of the witness made the observations I offered
</p>
<p>imavoidable.
</p>
<p>" Let us now see liow far this witness is suji-
</p>
<p>ported by other witnesses. Mary Rogers proves
</p>
<p>his statement as to the lorlgings ; Joseph Hall
</p>
<p>confirms him to a similar extent. Lord Ilarrow-
</p>
<p>by and his servant confirms him so far, as to prove
</p>
<p>the intention of giving his cabinet dinner on Wed-
</p>
<p>nesday night. Of this there is no doubt. Hyden
</p>
<p>is proved to have spoken to his Lordship in the
</p>
<p>Park. Three witnesses are called, which was
</p>
<p>not necessary, to prove that the room in Cato-
</p>
<p>street had been taken ; but the parade of confir-
</p>
<p>mation in this matter is meant to cast an air of
</p>
<p>credibility over other parts of the evidence. I
</p>
<p>now advert to collateral confirmations. The shar-
</p>
<p>pening of Ings's sword, the acquaintance of Har-
</p>
<p>rison with the state of the barracks, the redeem-
</p>
<p>ing of a blunderbuss from pawn for murder, not
</p>
<p>treason, have been all proved.
</p>
<p>" It is true, Hyden and Dwyer are not accom
</p>
<p>plices, they are to be believed, if their testimony is
</p>
<p>credible. Hyden long ago, before his late Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty's death, states to Wilson, with whom alone
</p>
<p>he was acquainted, that grenades were to be
</p>
<p>thrown under the table, and that those who should

<p>escape were to be killed with the sword. But
</p>
<p>he mentions no ulterior object deserving of the
</p>
<p>name of treason. Whatever the object might be,
</p>
<p>Hyden goes first to Lord Castlereagh, who was
</p>
<p>the object ol their peculiar spleen; then not find-
</p>
<p>ing him, to Lord llarrowby. But what the nature

</p>
<p>Wilson would not, for the accom})lishmcnt of it,
</p>
<p>lose a shilling or half-a-crown to be gained by
</p>
<p>going with cream to a nobleman. He knew that
</p>
<p>no such thing as a revolution was to be done.
</p>
<p>This, gentlemen, is not the way that kings arc
</p>
<p>destroyed, and governments overthrown.
</p>
<p>"I do nut say that the question should not en-
</p>
<p>ter into your consideration, l)ut 1 say that vou
</p>
<p>cannot find a verdict for the Attorney (general, if
</p>
<p>you do not believe Adams ; and I have laboured
</p>
<p>very much in vain, if you have not dismissed his
</p>
<p>evidence from your minds. Monument has not
</p>
<p>in the slightest degree contirmed Adams as to the
</p>
<p>proceedings previously to those in Cato-street ;
</p>
<p>and he has no memory of having ever seen so re-
</p>
<p>markable a man as Adams at Cato-street. Monu-
</p>
<p>ment knew nothing of the murder of Ministers,

<p>and the expectation of plunder as the consequence

<p>of its effects on others.

<p>to Colonel James within an hour of the time the

<p>communication was made to him on the 23d of

<p>February. Colonel James advised him to go to

<p>like the card -house of a baby. Adams sees not
</p>
<p>what is done in Cato-street. Monument sees not
</p>
<p>Adams, and is not seen by Adams. Dwyer sees
</p>
<p>neither Adams nor Monument on any occasion.
</p>
<p>Monument, like Wilson, is so cold in the cause,
</p>
<p>that, when he has a pair of shoes to mend, he pays
</p>
<p>no attention to the plot. This is not evidence on
</p>
<p>which you can believe the existence of treason.
</p>
<p>" As a plot, it is beneath the attention of Go-
</p>
<p>vernment.
</p>
<p>** That plan of assassination which has filled
</p>
<p>the nation with horror, was such, that nothing
</p>
<p>can be too effectual to guard against it, and the
</p>
<p>utmost vigilance of the magistrates ought to be
</p>
<p>exercised to prevent a mischief so nefarious from
</p>
<p>finding shelter in society. But I will say, in the
</p>
<p>words of a great writer, that ' the chirpings of
</p>
<p>the grasshoppers disturb not the stately ox, who
</p>
<p>grazes unconscious of their noise." So is it un-
</p>
<p>worthy of the Government of this country to pro-
</p>
<p>secute as traitors some dozen of ragged beggars,
</p>
<p>impatient of extreme poverty.
</p>
<p>" I shall point out to you in what points
</p>
<p>Adams is materially contradicted. Here you
</p>
<p>will remember that one contradiction is of more
</p>
<p>importance than ten thousand confirmations.
</p>
<p>Confirmations to any extent, only prove that the
</p>
<p>witness spoke truth to that extent ; one contra-
</p>
<p>diction proves the unprincipled contempt of an
</p>
<p>oath, and the wilful fabrication of falsehood.

<p>known nothing of those frequent meetings, where
</p>
<p>so many persons attended, and where such noises
</p>
<p>were made as had been described. Would not
</p>
<p>the Jury think it a very singular circumstance that
</p>
<p>the landlady should have been ignorant of all this
</p>
<p>passing in her own house? Let the Jurv now look
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF TIUSTLF.WOOD. 2^2fj
</p>
<p>to the account given by Adams of what passed in
</p>
<p>Cato-street He stated that there was only one
</p>
<p>candle lighted. The officers, however, proved that
</p>
<p>there were eight, and that they were all put out
</p>
<p>on the tiring of the pistol. He was equally in-
</p>
<p>correct in describing what was said. It w^as not
</p>
<p>as he swore, * there is a pretty nest of you."
</p>
<p>No ; for the evidence of the officers themselves
</p>
<p>went only to the words,  ' We are officers, lay
</p>
<p>down your arms.' He (Adams) knew when in
</p>
<p>prison, that something was said by the officers,
</p>
<p>and he made that account which he thought the
</p>
<p>least likely to be contradicted.
</p>
<p>" What would the Jury infer from those con-
</p>
<p>tradictions and inconsistencies in his evidence ;
</p>
<p>but, that he was a man who respected neither
</p>
<p>God nor his Gospel, and wdio swore to that wiiich
</p>
<p>he knew to be untrue. Would they, under such
</p>
<p>circumstances, attach any weight to his evi-
</p>
<p>dence ? Ijut he (Mr. Adolphus) w^ould come to
</p>
<p>another part of his evidence, where he w^as not
</p>
<p>only contradicted with the account given by
</p>
<p>others, but where he was inconsistent with him-
</p>
<p>self.
</p>
<p>" It would be recollected, that he swore to
</p>
<p>Strange being present at the meetings on two oc-
</p>
<p>casions ; yet, when Strange w^as put to the bar
</p>
<p>he could not recognise him  not point him out
</p>
<p>whom he swore to as having been present at two
</p>
<p>meetings held in the open day. Was this the
</p>
<p>man u])on whose evidence the Jury could return

<p>the name of Ijlwards in this case ; this man,
</p>
<p>who lived at 1^(5, l-leet-strect, who afterwards
</p>
<p>lived at Ivanelagh-place, why was not this man
</p>
<p>called? He was not an accomplice in any cri-

<p>minal decirec, ;is must be inferred from the con-
</p>
<p>^30 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>duct of Government in letting him go quite at
</p>
<p>large. Why was not this man called ? They
</p>
<p>would then have the spy to support the testimony
</p>
<p>of the informer. He could tell the Jury why ;
</p>
<p>because it was remembered what had been the
</p>
<p>effect of calling a witness of a similar description
</p>
<p>on a former occasion. The witness then pro-
</p>
<p>duced underwent a long and able cross-examina-
</p>
<p>tion from the Counsel employed for the prisoners,
</p>
<p>and the result was, that he and his testimony
</p>
<p>were put out of Court together, and had no other
</p>
<p>effect on the minds of the Jury, than to convince
</p>
<p>them that the whole was a fabrication.
</p>
<p>" If Edwards had been called, he would have
</p>
<p>told the Jury how this case had been got up ;
</p>
<p>for he was well acquainted with the whole ma-
</p>
<p>chinery of it. It would be recollected, that it
</p>
<p>was he who made the fusee for the hand-o-renades ;
</p>
<p>what would the Jury infer from his non-appear-
</p>
<p>ance, but that the whole of this case, as far as re-
</p>
<p>lated to the charge of high treason, was a fabri-
</p>
<p>cation destitute of any foundation whatever.
</p>
<p>*' He would now come to a part of the state-
</p>
<p>ment made by the Attorney-General in his address
</p>
<p>to the Jury. He had said, that he supposed a part
</p>
<p>of the defence would be, that the Jury should
</p>
<p>discredit the whole of this story, from its great
</p>
<p>improbability. He (Mr. Adolphus) had never any
</p>
<p>such intention, nor did he think, that the young-
</p>
<p>est advocate at the bar would have attempted
</p>
<p>such a line of defence.

<p>few of his followers, and endeavoured to stir up

<p>the citizens to rebellion; imagining that the people
</p>
<p>might be induced to second his scheme, and
</p>
<p>eti'ect in a moment that which he had madly
</p>
<p>fancied.
</p>
<p>" This was a most wild and visionary plan ;
</p>
<p>but, if we were reject it on the ground of its im-
</p>
<p>probability, we should be blotting a page from
</p>
<p>our history, the trutli of which was never before
</p>
<p>doubted. No, it was not his intention to deny
</p>
<p>the existence of the present plan, on tlie ground
</p>
<p>of its improbability, but he wished the Jury to
</p>
<p>disbelieve the witness, on the ground of the im-
</p>
<p>probability of the plot as he had described it.
</p>
<p>When, in the course of yesterday, they saw the
</p>
<p>pikes, and swords, and pistols and guns, and
</p>
<p>hand-grenades, which were taken from the pri-
</p>
<p>soners, or at their houses, no doubt they might

<p>have felt some alarm.

<p>of some persons who M-ere near him at that
</p>
<p>moment ; one of whom said, he should not like
</p>
<p>to have one of those instruments presented to his
</p>
<p>breast. No doubt; nobody would like it: but let
</p>
<p>the Jury seriously consider, how those instruments
</p>
<p>were to be applied. If they took the twelve hun-

<p>dred rounds of ball-cartridge which were said to

<p>have been taken, and divided them by twenty-four,
</p>
<p>they would find that they had just annnunition

<p>Others who might have been called were kept out

<p>the government and constitution of this country?
</p>
<p>He tliought he could shew, that their object was
</p>
<p>quite of another description.
</p>
<p>*' Let the Jury look at the situation in which
</p>
<p>the prisoner at the bar stood. They had, as was
</p>
<p>stated by the Attorney General, often before
</p>
<p>heard of him. He had, not very long before the
</p>
<p>present transaction, been released from Horse-
</p>
<p>monger-lane prison, where he had been confined
</p>
<p>in consequence of a letter sent to my Lord Sid-
</p>
<p>mouth. He came forth from that prison with
</p>
<p>rancorous feelings against that noble lord, and
</p>
<p>probably against others of his Majesty's ministers;
</p>
<p>would not such a man be a fit subject to work
</p>
<p>upon, in proposing an attack upon the lives of
</p>
<p>those ministers ? Must not the Jury suppose
</p>
<p>that the other prisoners would have heated feel-
</p>
<p>ings, after the transaction which took place at
</p>
<p>Manchester? He would not ofier any comments
</p>
<p>upon that transaction, further than to say, that
</p>
<p>all which was said and written upon it, was not
</p>
<p>without an efi"ect; and, on the minds of the
</p>
<p>prisoners, would it be strange, that an artful and
</p>
<p>cunning man might work such an effect as to
</p>
<p>excite them to the murder of his Majesty's minis-
</p>
<p>ters, which would not of itself amount to high
</p>
<p>treason ? With their feelings worked up, some of
</p>
<p>them with strong personal enmity against some
</p>
<p>of those ministers, they had determined ui)on
</p>
<p>making an attack upon several of them at their

<p>houses.

<p>Times, placed there by the hand that was to
</p>
<p>betray them, that a Cabinet dinner was to take
</p>
<p>place on the Wednesday following at Lord Har-
</p>
<p>rowby's. Did not the whole of their conduct
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF TIIISTLFWOOD, 233
</p>
<p>shew that it was against the ministers themselves
</p>
<p>that the attack was intended, and not against
</p>
<p>the government, or with a view of effecting a
</p>
<p>revolution? and was there not proof, that this
</p>
<p>personal feeling was excited by some of the
</p>
<p>recent transactions at Manchester to which he
</p>
<p>had alluded ? What was the speech which Ings
</p>
<p>was to have made on the arrival of the party at
</p>
<p>Lord Harrowby's house, where the ministers
</p>
<p>were expected to be assembled ? * My lords,
</p>
<p>you see we have got men as good as the Man-
</p>
<p>chester yeomanry ;' and then, turning to his
</p>
<p>associates, * Citizens, advance, and do your
</p>
<p>duty!'
</p>
<p>*' During the whole of these proceedings,
</p>
<p>nothing was heard of any intended attack upon
</p>
<p>Carlton-House, or upon any of the branches of
</p>
<p>the illustrious family of Brunswick. There was
</p>
<p>no such thing. The whole which their prepara-
</p>
<p>tions and intentions embraced, were  first, the
</p>
<p>murder of his xMajesty's ministers, and then
</p>
<p>robbery. This was the object of setting fire to
</p>
<p>some houses, that plunder might be obtained
</p>
<p>in the confusion which might be thereby created.
</p>
<p>" These, to be sure, were heinous crimes, but
</p>
<p>they did not amount to the charge of high treason
</p>
<p>against the prisoners. The setting fire to build-
</p>
<p>ings, with the intention of robbing in the con-
</p>
<p>fusion which the fire would create, was not,
</p>
<p>unfortunately, a novel case. He was old enough
</p>
<p>to remember, and perhaps some of the jury
</p>
<p>might also recollect the circumstance of the
</p>
<p>setting fire to the premises of a timber-merchant,
</p>
<p>in order to rob a pawn-broker s shop, which was

<p>close by it. Indeed, the manner in which some
</p>
<p>of the prisoners had spoken of the shopkeepers
</p>
<p>of London, shewed that their o])ject was plunder,
</p>
<p>and it appeared that bags were made for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of holding such j)lunder.
</p>
<p>" He had now gone through the whole of the
</p>
<p>2H
</p>
<p>234 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>points on which it was his intention to trouble
</p>
<p>the Jury. He had done so, perhaps, imperfectly,
</p>
<p>but he would not apologize for the time which
</p>
<p>he had delayed them. He had not, on this occa-
</p>
<p>sion, all the preparation which was desirable.
</p>
<p>On the contrary, he had but a very short notice
</p>
<p>of the duty which he was to perform ; and, he
</p>
<p>remembered, on a former occasion, that one of
</p>
<p>the most learned Counsel at the bar expressed
</p>
<p>his inadequacy to a similar task, though he
</p>
<p>stated, that he had occupied a month in pre-
</p>
<p>paring for the defence.
</p>
<p>*' In pleading for the life of the unfortunate
</p>
<p>man at the bar, and, after him, of the other
</p>
<p>prisoners, it was not too much for him to ask the
</p>
<p>Jury to consider well the nature of the evidence
</p>
<p>which had been given in support of the charge of
</p>
<p>high treason. He now, however, left the case
</p>
<p>entirely with the Jury. If- they thought, under
</p>
<p>all the circumstances, that there was evidence
</p>
<p>sufficient to prove the charge, then he should
</p>
<p>submit ; but if, on the other hand, they were of
</p>
<p>opinion that the case was not made out, or that
</p>
<p>it was not proved to their satisfaction, they would,
</p>
<p>he was confident, acquit the prisoner.
</p>
<p>" The learned gentleman again expressed his
</p>
<p>own inability to give the Jury a perfect direction
</p>
<p>on this important trial; and concluded by praying
</p>
<p>that God might direct and enlighten their minds
</p>
<p>on the awful occasion, so that they might admi-
</p>
<p>nister impartial justice, always remembering that
</p>
<p>the highest attribute of justice was mercy; and
</p>
<p>that, whether the result of their verdict should
</p>
<p>be, that the prisoner would only have a week to

</p>
<p>Providence might please to extend them, it would
</p>
<p>be dictated by justice, tempered with mercy."
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice now addressed the
</p>
<p>prisoner, and said, if you wish to olier any thing
</p>

</p>
<p>nesses examined to the testimony of Dwyer.
</p>
<p>There is a man in Court who will prove that Dwyer
</p>
<p>extorted money from him.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Justice.  You must not state
</p>
<p>that ; you should have consulted with your
</p>
<p>Counsel. The time for giving evidence is now
</p>
<p>past.
</p>
<p>Tidstlewood.  I will wave it then, my Lord. I
</p>
<p>have nothing further to offer.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General now commenced his
</p>
<p>reply. He said, " That in rising to address the
</p>
<p>Jury in support of this prosecution, he felt that
</p>
<p>he had a most anxious and painful duty to dis-
</p>
<p>charge. As the servant of the public on this oc-
</p>
<p>casion, it was his duty to perform the service with
</p>
<p>which that public had intrusted him to the utmost
</p>
<p>of his ability and power. He was anxious, there-
</p>
<p>fore, that nothing should be omitted on his part
</p>
<p>for the purpose of presenting this case in a fair
</p>
<p>and proper view before them. At the same time,
</p>
<p>he felt anxious that, in the prosecution of what he
</p>
<p>was about to state, he should not misrepresent a
</p>
<p>single fact, far less a single argument, against the
</p>
<p>prisoner, or offer an observation which the justice
</p>
<p>of the case might not fairly warrant.
</p>
<p>" He begged leave to join with his learned
</p>
<p>friend (Mr. Adolphus) in praying the gentlemen
</p>
<p>of the Jury to dismiss from their minds all pre-
</p>
<p>judices and impressions unfavourable to the pri-
</p>
<p>soner, and to confine their attention solely and
</p>
<p>undividcdly to the evidence which had been laid

<p>before them, on the oaths of the witnesses whom
</p>
<p>they had heard. In saying this, he was aware
</p>
<p>that it was superfluous and unnecessary. He
</p>
<p>was addressing an English Jury  a body of men

<p>sworn to administer justice to the public on the

</p>
<p>one hand, and to the prisoner on the other ; and
</p>
<p>he ought to apologize for suggesting a doubt, that,
</p>
<p>in the discharge of their momentous duty, they
</p>
<p>would not keep their eyes steadily fixed on the
</p>
<p>evidence, upon which the fate of the person at
</p>
<p>the bar must ultimately turn.
</p>
<p>'* The situation in which the prisoner then stood
</p>
<p>was an admirable proof of the excellent system of
</p>
<p>our laws, and of their being built and formed upon
</p>
<p>the principles of liberty and freedom. They had
</p>
<p>had it not only proved in evidence, but admitted
</p>
<p>by the Counsel for the prisoner, that he had pro-
</p>
<p>jected and harboured in his mind the assassina-
</p>
<p>tion of the confidential servants of the Crown.
</p>
<p>" They were aware of the passions and preju-
</p>
<p>dices which were excited by this discovery in the
</p>
<p>public mind, and they saw that this prosecution
</p>
<p>was not commenced, nor was the unfortunate man
</p>
<p>placed upon his trial, until an opportunity was af-
</p>
<p>forded for those passions and prejudices to sub-
</p>
<p>side. Independent of this, he was entitled to the
</p>
<p>delivery to him of all the particulars of the accu-
</p>
<p>sation which he was called upon to answer ; and
</p>
<p>these particulars had been delivered to him at a
</p>
<p>period so far back as three weeks from the present
</p>
<p>time. This indulgence was granted to him, in
</p>
<p>order that he might have an opportunity of con-
</p>
<p>sulting Counsel as to any point of law, or any ob-
</p>
<p>jection which might arise in his favour ; and in
</p>
<p>order also that he might bring forward such testi-
</p>
<p>mony as might be necessary to his defence. He
</p>
<p>had also a list of all the Jurymen, who could by
</p>
<p>possibility be called to sit on his trial, and these
</p>
<p>he might reject, without assigning a cause, to the

</p>
<p>number of thirty-five.
</p>
<p>" On this account he was justified in saying,
</p>
<p>that the Jury whom he was then addressing, what-
</p>
<p>ever might be the result of their deliberations, was
</p>
<p>a Jury of the prisoner's own choice. The prisoner,
</p>
<p>also, had received a list of the witnesses who were
</p>
<p>TUIAL or THISTLE'SVOOD. 237
</p>
<p>to be called by the Crown. That list was fur-
</p>
<p>nished in order that he might have an opportunity
</p>
<p>of inquiring into the previous character, history,
</p>
<p>and conduct of every witness who might be called
</p>
<p>against him, and for the purpose of enabling him
</p>
<p>to impeach their character, if his inquiry should
</p>
<p>enable him so to do. Such was the benevolent
</p>
<p>spirit of the British law ; and such the advantages
</p>
<p>to which a man, placed in the situation of the
</p>
<p>j)risoner, was entitled.
</p>
<p>" The charge against the prisoner was, that of
</p>
<p>having conspired to overturn the Constitution,
</p>
<p>under which that system of Government existed.
</p>
<p>It was a question whether the subtitution of the
</p>
<p>Government which he might have contemplated,
</p>
<p>would have been distinguished bv a character of
</p>
<p>so admirable a description. He had no doubt
</p>
<p>that the Jury would pay that anxious and careful
</p>
<p>attention to this case which its importance de-
</p>
<p>manded, and that they would not come to a ver-
</p>
<p>dict of Guilty, unless they were satisfied that that
</p>
<p>verdict was justified by the clearest evidence.
</p>
<p>But, at the same time, he called upon them to
</p>
<p>[)erform their duty, fearless of all consequences ;
</p>
<p>to turn neither to the right nor to the lelt, but to
</p>
<p>})ronounce such a verdict as was consistent with
</p>
<p>a proper feeling towards their country, and with
</p>
<p>a due regard to the solemn obligation into which
</p>
<p>they had entered.
</p>
<p>" With respect to the law upon the subject, it
</p>
<p>was not necessary to trouble them with any ob-
</p>
<p>servation. In the charge against the prisoner
</p>
<p>there was nothing of a difficult or questionable
</p>
<p>description. He was charged with conspiring for

<p>the purpose of overturning the Government of the
</p>
<p>country, and with endeavouring to accomplish that
</p>
<p>by means of the assassination of his Majesty's
</p>
<p>Ministers. If the Jury, upon a due and carel'ul
</p>
<p>examination of the evidence, were satisfied that
</p>
<p>1 <: had so conspired, and that he had been found
</p>
<p>238 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACy,
</p>
<p>taking measures to accomplisk that object, then,
</p>
<p>in point of law, he was guilty of the crime im-
</p>
<p>puted to him. It was admitted on all hands that
</p>
<p>a plot had been formed to assassinate the Minis-
</p>
<p>ters of the King, and not to assassinate one, two,
</p>
<p>or three, of those individuals against whom the
</p>
<p>prisoner might be supposed to have some personal
</p>
<p>enmity. The blow had been aimed not against
</p>
<p>one, but against all.
</p>
<p>" The Jury would consider whether such an in-
</p>
<p>tention was founded with a view to overturn the
</p>
<p>Government of the country ; or, whether, as had
</p>
<p>been fancifully surmised by the Counsel for the
</p>
<p>prisoner, the sole object had been the plunder of
</p>
<p>private property, and the gratification of private
</p>
<p>revenge. They would look with jealousy to the
</p>
<p>testimony which had been adduced before them,
</p>
<p>and upon that they would conclude whether the
</p>
<p>steps which had been taken were directed by the
</p>
<p>desire of promoting revolution, or solely with a
</p>
<p>view of obtaining plunder in the confusion which
</p>
<p>would necessarily follow.
</p>
<p>*' In considering the evidence of an accomplice,
</p>
<p>they would naturally look to his previous charac-
</p>
<p>ter ; they would see whether there was any thing
</p>
<p>in his former course of life, from whence to con-
</p>
<p>clude that he was a man capable of pursuing a
</p>
<p>continued and undeviating course of crime ; but,
</p>
<p>above all, they would consider from all the cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances of the case, what degree of credit
</p>
<p>ought fairly to be given to his evidence. He knew
</p>
<p>of no law that applied to accomplices, which did
</p>
<p>not apply to every other witness who came into
</p>
<p>a Court of Justice.

<p>" The evidence of every witness ought to be exa-
</p>
<p>mined with care and jealousy, and in proportion
</p>
<p>only as his story was consistent with probability
</p>
<p>was he entitled to belief. Now let them look to
</p>
<p>the fair test upon which the evidence of Adams
</p>
<p>was to be tried. His character, up to the time
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF THISTLEWOOD. 239
</p>
<p>of his entering into the diabolical schemes of the
</p>
<p>prisoner, was unimpeached ; and, if any thing-
</p>
<p>could be urged on that score, no doubt the pri-
</p>
<p>soner Brunt, with whom he had been intimately
</p>
<p>acquainted, would not fail to have adduced it.
</p>
<p>In so much, therefore, he stood upon fair and eli-
</p>
<p>gible grounds.
</p>
<p>" Then they would ask themselves, what inte-
</p>
<p>rest he could have in stating that which was not
</p>
<p>true ? The more criminal the plot which he dis-
</p>
<p>closed, the blacker hue he gave to his own repu-
</p>
<p>tation ; and, added to this, he knew that, from
</p>
<p>the candour and correctness of his confession
</p>
<p>could he alone hope for mercy towards himself.
</p>
<p>Then he must be aware, that if he stated that
</p>
<p>which was false, his story was capable of contra-
</p>
<p>diction, and therefore altogether fruitless. So
</p>
<p>that, in every point of view, he was a competent
</p>
<p>witness. As was before said, however, the Jury
</p>
<p>still had the power of exercising their own sound
</p>
<p>discretion, and of placing in him only that degree
</p>
<p>of confidence which he seemed to deserve, and
</p>
<p>which the confirmation he had received fairly
</p>
<p>justified.
</p>
<p>" The learned counsel for the prisoner had made
</p>
<p>use of the gratuitous expression, that this man,
</p>
<p>Adams, was the only witness to prove the case.
</p>
<p>Was this the fact ? Were there not three other
</p>
<p>witnesses who all spoke to the same occurrences ;
</p>
<p>he alluded to Monument, Hiden, and Dwyer ; the
</p>
<p>two latter of whom were, in all respects pure and
</p>
<p>uncontaminated ; for what had been said of
</p>
<p>Dwyer was absolutely beneath consideration.

<p>never seen each other  and yet they all agreed
</p>
<p>in their story as to the plan for assassinating his
</p>
<p>Majesty's Ministers, seizing cannon, providing
</p>
<p>arms, burning houses, and establishing a provi-

<p>who spoke to points trivial in themselves, but all
</p>
<p>confirmatory of Adams, and, as it were, com-
</p>
<p>pletely dovetailing with the most minute parts of
</p>
<p>his story.
</p>
<p>" This was the case with regard to Brunt's ap-
</p>
<p>prentice ; to the landlady of the house in which
</p>
<p>Brunt lived, and her daughter ; to the officers by
</p>
<p>whom Brunt's house had been searched ; and
</p>
<p>even to Tidd's own daughter, whose story was
</p>
<p>precisely consistent with the plan which had
</p>
<p>been detailed, but which had been so providen-
</p>
<p>tially frustrated. In fact, each witness formed a
</p>
<p>link in the general chain, which was complete in
</p>
<p>all its parts. But there was a still stronger argu-
</p>
<p>ment in favour of all that had been stated, and
</p>
<p>that was, that it had not been contradicted by
</p>
<p>evidence, although such evidence was capable of
</p>
<p>being produced. For, if what Adams had dis-
</p>
<p>closed was not true, why were Potter, and
</p>
<p>Cook, and Palin, to all of whom he spoke as
</p>
<p>having been present at the various meetings which
</p>
<p>took place, and who were eligible witnesses for
</p>
<p>the prisoner, not called.
</p>
<p>" The absence of these men afforded an addi-
</p>
<p>tional reason for giving implicit belief to all which
</p>
<p>the witnesses for the crown had said. The
</p>
<p>learned gentleman then proceeded in a luminous
</p>
<p>and eloquent strain, still farther to illustrate his
</p>
<p>argument, and with great ingenuity to contend
</p>
<p>that it was impossible, under all the circum-
</p>
<p>stances of the case, for the Jury to come to any
</p>
<p>other conclusion than that the several charges of
</p>
<p>high treason imputed to the prisoner had been
</p>
<p>established beyond all doubt. If, however, as

</p>
<p>had been said by his learned friend (Mr. Adolphus)
</p>
<p>any doubt did exist, to the benefit of that doubt
</p>
<p>the prisoner was fully entitled."
</p>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice Abbot proceeded to sum
</p>
<p>up. " This, he said, was an indictment against
</p>
<p>Arthur Thistlcwood, the prisoner then at the bar,
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF THISTLEWOOD. 241
</p>
<p>and several other persons, who, in the progress
</p>
<p>of the trial, had appeared at the bar, in order to
</p>
<p>be identified for the crime of High Treason.
</p>
<p>That otlcnce had truly been stated as the highest
</p>
<p>crime known to the law. It was so, because it
</p>
<p>did not merely produce individual and private
</p>
<p>evil, as most other crimes did, but, in addition to
</p>
<p>+hat, it created great and extensive public
</p>
<p>mischief.
</p>
<p>" A charge so grave and serious required there-
</p>
<p>fore, at the hands of an English Jury (and would,
</p>
<p>he was sure, from what he had seen, receive) the
</p>
<p>most mature and patient consideration. The
</p>
<p>charge, as it stood in the indictment, consisted
</p>
<p>of several counts. First, conspiring and ima-
</p>
<p>gining to depose the King; 2d, conspiring and
</p>
<p>imagining to put the King to death ; 3d, con-
</p>
<p>spiring and imagining to levy war against the
</p>
<p>King, in order to compel him to change his coun-
</p>
<p>cils ; and 4th, actually levying war against the
</p>
<p>King.
</p>
<p>" Two of these offences, conspiring the deposi-
</p>
<p>tion of the Monarch, and levying war against
</p>
<p>him, were declared to be treason, by a statute
</p>
<p>passed so long ago as the reign of Edward the
</p>
<p>Third. In the construction of that statute, it had
</p>
<p>been held, not only in many cases decided in this
</p>
<p>country, but also in the opinion delivered to us
</p>
<p>by various learned writers on this law, that all
</p>
<p>conspiracies and attempts to depose his Majesty,
</p>
<p>and all conspiracies to levy war against him, were
</p>
<p>treasonable, and must be considered as overt
</p>
<p>acts, proving an intention to take away his life ;

<p>his kingly authority.
</p>
<p>*' Ikit, in order to remove any mistake that
</p>
<p>persons might fall into on this subject, a statute
</p>
<p>was passed in the reign of his late Majesty,
</p>
<p>similar in substance, and nearly so in language,
</p>
<p>2I
</p>
<p>242 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>to statutes that had been enacted in former years,
</p>
<p>but which had expired. By that statute, the
</p>
<p>conspiring or compassing to depose the King, or
</p>
<p>to levy war against him, were declared to be
</p>
<p>substantive treasons. Some of the persons called
</p>
<p>before them on this occasion were represented,
</p>
<p>and truly represented, to have been accomplices
</p>
<p>in this traitorous design. This character did not,
</p>
<p>however, apply to all the witnesses who had been
</p>
<p>brought forward.
</p>
<p>*' Much observation had been made on the degree
</p>
<p>of credit that ought to be given to persons, who
</p>
<p>admitted thatthey had joined in the design. On this
</p>
<p>point she should only say, that, according to the law
</p>
<p>of this country, and, he believed, of every other
</p>
<p>country, accomplices were considered competent
</p>
<p>witnesses; but the credit that should be given
</p>
<p>to them was matter of consideration. The evi-
</p>
<p>dence of an accomplice was to be weighed, with
</p>
<p>reference to the probability of the story he
</p>
<p>told, the confirmation of it, so far as it was
</p>
<p>capable of confirmation, and the absence of that
</p>
<p>contradiction which might be adduced, if the
</p>
<p>story were false.
</p>
<p>" There was, however, no rule of law which
</p>
<p>said, that the testimony of an accomplice ought to
</p>
<p>be credited ; neither was there any rule of law
</p>
<p>which declared that it must be rejected. To de-
</p>
<p>clare the latter would be to open the door, and
</p>
<p>give the greatest latitude and impunity to crime.
</p>
<p>For, as had been said by the learned counsel for
</p>
<p>the prosecution, if such a doctrine were acted on,
</p>
<p>bad men would feel that they might proceed in
</p>
<p>their base designs with perfect security, and they

<p>would trust each other without reserve ; whereas
</p>
<p>bad men now distrusted each other. They were
</p>
<p>afraid of detection ; and that distrust prevented

<p>t^.e commission of many ofi*ences which could not

</p>
<p>" Having made these general observations, to
</p>
<p>direct their attention to the evidence, he would
</p>
<p>now, some hours having elapsed since the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses were heard, read to the Jury such parts of
</p>
<p>the testimony as were necessary for their consi-
</p>
<p>deration in coming to a decision. [Here his Lord-
</p>
<p>ship proceeded to recapitulate the evidence, briefly
</p>
<p>commenting on it as he went on.]
</p>
<p>*' The first witness was R. Adams, who un-
</p>
<p>doubtedly stood in the situation of an accomplice.
</p>
<p>But, if the story he told were false, there were
</p>
<p>several persons mentioned by him, and they
</p>
<p>could have been brought forward to disprove his
</p>
<p>statement, and to discharge themselves of the
</p>
<p>crime imputed to them, if they were innocent, but
</p>
<p>whom the Crown could not compel to appear.
</p>
<p>This witness said, that the officers, when they
</p>
<p>entered the room in Cato-street, cried out,
</p>
<p>* Here's a pretty nest of you ; we have a war-
</p>
<p>rant to take you all ;' and the officers swore they
</p>
<p>only called out, ' We are officers  surrender.'
</p>
<p>This difference was not material. The two ex-
</p>
<p>pressions were nearly the same in import ; and,
</p>
<p>in the scene of confusion which undoubtedly oc-
</p>
<p>curred on the entrance of the officers, it was very
</p>
<p>possible that a mistake might arise as to the exact
</p>
<p>expression used.
</p>
<p>" That part of the evidence, in which Adams
</p>
<p>described his irresolution, gave, his Lordship ob-
</p>
<p>served, the exact picture of a man of weak minci,
</p>
<p>not knowing whether he should go on or recede 
</p>
<p>balancing whether he should remain true to his
</p>
<p>associates, or make a discovery  and who, when
</p>
<p>taken into custody, did come to the resolution to

</p>
<p>disclose all he knew. If his testimony were true
</p>
<p>in substance and general cfTcct, it proved not
</p>
<p>only a determination to assassinate his Majesty's
</p>
<p>Ministers, but shewed to them that that was only
</p>
<p>a part of a move extended and general plan, which
</p>
<p>embraced the seizure of arms, the taking posses-
</p>

</p>
<p>244 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>sion of the Mansion-house, and the forming of a
</p>
<p>Provisional Government ; a plan formed on some
</p>
<p>vain expectation, that, if the blow were ever
</p>
<p>struck, there were 'a great number of people
</p>
<p>in the metropolis who would readily join in
</p>
<p>the scheme, and levy war against his Majesty '
</p>
<p>Such an expectation was vain then, and he hoped
</p>
<p>would ever be found so when such treasonable
</p>
<p>attempts were made.
</p>
<p>" This witness mentioned a man, named Ed-
</p>
<p>wards. Why he was not examined his Lordship
</p>
<p>could not say. Perhaps the prosecutors did not
</p>
<p>wish to call him for very good reasons. How far
</p>
<p>the Jury would disbelieve Adams on that account,
</p>
<p>it was for them to say. What he had remarked
</p>
<p>on the evidence of this witness, he was sorry to
</p>
<p>say, was considerably against the prisoner. As
</p>
<p>to the character of Adams, before this transac-
</p>
<p>tion, they knew nothing. No person had said
</p>
<p>any thing about it. Hyden was a witness of a
</p>
<p>very different description ; for he, it appeared,
</p>
<p>disclosed all he knew, early enough to prevent the
</p>
<p>mischief that was meditated.
</p>
<p>** John Monument, another accomplice, corro-
</p>
<p>borated Adams. He stated that the prisoner said
</p>
<p>to him, * Great events are at hand ; the people
</p>
<p>everywhere are anxious for a change.' This ob-
</p>
<p>servation shewed that the assassination of Minis-
</p>
<p>ters was not the sole and only object of the
</p>
<p>parties. The evidence of Thomas Dwyer, as far
</p>
<p>as it went, confirmed the testimony of those who
</p>
<p>were examined before him. If his statement were
</p>
<p>correct, the prisoner told him the general plan
</p>
<p>and object which he and his associates had in

<p>view. These were the four witnesses called to
</p>
<p>explain the designs of the accused parties. Two
</p>
<p>of tliem were accomplices ; but, in general, none
</p>
<p>but accomplices could be acquainted with such
</p>
<p>foul and illegal designs. The two other witnesses
</p>
<p>did not stand in the same situation. Comnumi-

</p>
<p>cations were made to them, on the subject of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, it appeared, with little reserve ;  a
</p>
<p>circumstance of which the Jury were to judj^e.
</p>
<p>" A great many other persons had been called,
</p>
<p>chiefly for the purpose of confirming the testi-
</p>
<p>mony given by these witnesses ; for, if they had
</p>
<p>spoken to truth, without farther evidence to the
</p>
<p>facts, treason was undoubtedly proved. They
</p>
<p>proved the intention to levy war, to form a Pro-
</p>
<p>visional Government, and, of course, to change
</p>
<p>the Government as by law established. Eliza
</p>
<p>Walker proved that the prisoner Brunt had hired
</p>
<p>a lodging for Ings in the house where he resided ;
</p>
<p>and Joseph Hale, Brunt's apprentice, deposed to
</p>
<p>the meetings that were held from time to time in
</p>
<p>Brunt's room. He proved that meetings were
</p>
<p>held there every evening, and that grenades, fire-
</p>
<p>balls, and pikes, were on the premises.
</p>
<p>" Thomas Sharp, a watchman, deposed, that he
</p>
<p>saw four suspicious persons, on the 22d of
</p>
<p>February, watching about Lord Harrowby's
</p>
<p>house. . Morrison, a cutler, proved that Ings
</p>
<p>brought him two swords to sharpen, and a sword
</p>
<p>found at Cato-street appeared to be one of them.
</p>
<p>Alderson, a pawnbroker, deposed, that, on the
</p>
<p>23d of February, Davidson took a blunderbuss
</p>
<p>out of pawn. Thomas Monument, the brother of
</p>
<p>John confirmed his testimony in several points.
</p>
<p>This was the evidence confirmatory of the testi-
</p>
<p>mony of the first four witnesses. Many of the
</p>
<p>facts stated by Adams were spoken to by them ;
</p>
<p>but the treasonable purpose could net be well
</p>
<p>proved, except by accomplices. Information on
</p>
<p>that point could scarcely be expected from a pure

</p>
<p>source. I lyden was a witness of that description ;
</p>
<p>but Dwyer, to a certain degree, was not.
</p>
<p>" The prosecutors then called persons to prove
</p>
<p>what occurred at the stable in Cato-street ; and
</p>
<p>Captain Fitzclarence, and several Bow-street
</p>
<p>officers, gave a detailed account of the transac-
</p>
<p>246 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>tions there. It did not appear to him necessary
</p>
<p>that he should go, in detail, through the testi-
</p>
<p>mony of these witnesses. It was not necessary
</p>
<p>to inquire by what particular hand a gun or a
</p>
<p>pistol was fired; but it was material to observe,
</p>
<p>that, when the officers did come, many at least
</p>
<p>of the persons present made a most desperate
</p>
<p>resistance. A knife, said to belong to Ings, was
</p>
<p>found on the premises ; and two bags and a case-
</p>
<p>knife were found on his person. The bags were
</p>
<p>important ; because it was sworn th*t he stated
</p>
<p>the purpose for which he brought them. It was
</p>
<p>argued by the Counsel for the defendant, that they
</p>
<p>were meant for the reception of plunder, and not
</p>
<p>for the horrible purpose that had been stated ;
</p>
<p>but this did not invalidate the testimony of Adams,
</p>
<p>because Ings might not have wished to declare
</p>
<p>that he meant to put plate in the bags ; and, if so
</p>
<p>he might have said, what he was sworn to have ut-
</p>
<p>tered, as a reason for carrying them. This closed
</p>
<p>the evidence for the Crown.
</p>
<p>" On the part of the prisoners, Mary Baker was
</p>
<p>called, \vho, the Jury would recollect, was not
</p>
<p>cross-examined. This arose from a commendable
</p>
<p>delicacy, on account of the near relationship in
</p>
<p>which she stood to one of the prisoners. The
</p>
<p>Jury would say, whether her evidence went at
</p>
<p>all to shake the case. Indeed, it appeared from
</p>
<p>her statement, that she had seen at Tidd's lodg-
</p>
<p>ings instruments similar to those produced in
</p>
<p>Court. A man named Hucklestone was then
</p>
<p>called, to prove that Dwyer was not to be believed
</p>
<p>on his oath ; and he stated, that he thought he
</p>
<p>was not worthy of belief, because Dwyer had in-

</p>
<p>formed him that he procured money by base ac-
</p>
<p>cusations. This however, was entirely contra-
</p>
<p>dicted by Dwyer ; and it was for the Jury to gay
</p>
<p>which of the two witnesses was entitled to their
</p>
<p>credit.
</p>
<p>" The Jury would also consider the character
</p>
<p>and bcarinjj of thti evidence of Doane and Mitchell,
</p>
<p>I'UIAr. OF THISTLEWOOD. 247
</p>
<p>with respect to the paragraph in The Nevf Timer,
</p>
<p>announcing a cabinet dinner at Lord Harrowby's,
</p>
<p>which, according to Whittaker, was not on the
</p>
<p>same day in any other newspaper in London. It
</p>
<p>was, however, a matter of no consequence how it
</p>
<p>found its way into the paper, since it was proved
</p>
<p>that cabinet dinner was intended to be given on
</p>
<p>the 23d of February. This was the whole of tlie
</p>
<p>evidence on each side. No witness was called
</p>
<p>to impeach the veracity of Adams, Hyden, and
</p>
<p>Monument. And if they gave credit to any one
</p>
<p>of those persons, (even to Hyden, who supported
</p>
<p>what the others told them, and whose account,
</p>
<p>though more concise than theirs, was the same
</p>
<p>in effect), they must find a verdict against the
</p>
<p>prisoner.
</p>
<p>" Besides the testimony of the witnesses, they
</p>
<p>had seen on the table a considerable quantity of
</p>
<p>arms, which were proved to have been found in
</p>
<p>Cato-street, and at the lodgings of one of the
</p>
<p>prisoners. It was almost conceded, that a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy was entered into for the purpose of as-
</p>
<p>sassinating his Majesty's Ministers at Lord Har-
</p>
<p>rowby's house. Indeed there could be little
</p>
<p>doubt of it.
</p>
<p>" If then it were admitted that this most
</p>
<p>wicked scheme was entertained, it was for them
</p>
<p>to consider whether it could reasonably be sup-
</p>
<p>posed that that was all -which was intended ?
</p>
<p>They were to consider, what was the probability
</p>
<p>that those persons, unconnected in any respect
</p>
<p>with each other, except so far as this plan brought
</p>
<p>them together  and certainly quite unconnected
</p>
<p>with the persons who conducted the affairs of

</p>
<p>his Majesty's Government did not view that as-
</p>
<p>sassination as part of a scheme, having for its
</p>
<p>object a general and tumultuous rising of the peo-
</p>
<p>ple, to levy war against the King; or whe-
</p>
<p>ther they conspired to effect that assassination
</p>
<p>alone ?
</p>
<p>" Whether thev adopted this plan to satisfy
</p>
<p>248 CAtO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>their thirst for blood, or to accomplish that
</p>
<p>ulterior scheme to which the witnesses had
</p>
<p>spoken ? In deciding this question, it was fit that
</p>
<p>the Jury should attend to the great quantity, as
</p>
<p>well as the nature of the instruments produced.
</p>
<p>They certainly were far more in number than
</p>
<p>could have been wanted, or used in the abomi-
</p>
<p>nable attempt that was to be made at Lord
</p>
<p>Harrowby's. Some of them could not have been
</p>
<p>used there at all. The hand-grenades might have
</p>
<p>been thrown, but the fire-balls could not have
</p>
<p>been used for the purpose which they meant to
</p>
<p>effect at that house. When those dangerous ar-
</p>
<p>ticles were found, some at one place and some at
</p>
<p>another, it was for the Jury to take the circum-
</p>
<p>stance into their serious consideration.
</p>
<p>" If, on a view of the whole case, they, as just
</p>
<p>and conscientious men, felt satisfied that a con-
</p>
<p>spiracy to levy war was made out in proof before
</p>
<p>them, if their minds were freed from all doubt on
</p>
<p>the subject, they would, he was convinced, dis-
</p>
<p>charge the painful duty that devolved on them
</p>
<p>with proper firmness. But if, after a due exami-
</p>
<p>nation of all the circumstances, and after attend-
</p>
<p>ing to the observations of the very eloquent
</p>
<p>counsel, who had addressed them on the part of
</p>
<p>the prisoner, first and last, their minds were not
</p>
<p>satisfied that the case was proved, they would
</p>
<p>discharge the more pleasant duty of acquitting
</p>
<p>the prisoner. The case was now in their hands ;
</p>
<p>and he doubted not but their verdict would be
</p>
<p>consonant with the principles of justice."
</p>
<p>The Jury then retired ; but, in a few minutes
</p>
<p>returned into court, and requested his lordship

<p>Jury he seemed poignantly to feel the melancholy
</p>
<p>situation in which he was placed. The candid
</p>
<p>avowal, however, of his Counsel, as to his
</p>
<p>ultimate fate upon the indictments for murder,
</p>
<p>had left him no hope of escape of an ignominious
</p>
<p>death.
</p>
<p>When taken back to the cell, he seemed to be
</p>
<p>absorbed in the melancholy contemplation of his
</p>
<p>approaching fate, which he of course felt was
</p>
<p>irrevocably sealed. He scarcely uttered a single
</p>
<p>w^ord to those by whom he was accompanied, but
</p>
<p>threw himself into a chair, and appeared to be
</p>
<p>entirely abstracted from all about him. He
</p>
<p>partook of some refreshment, but was unable to
</p>
<p>recover his spirits.
</p>
<p>In the course of the evening he asked for a
</p>
<p>glass of wine, which Mr. Brown instantly sent to
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>It appeared that up to the last moment, This-
</p>
<p>tlewood confidently anticipated an acquittal, as
</p>
<p>indeed did many persons of respectability who
</p>
<p>were in Court. The speech of Mr. Adolphus had
</p>
<p>a powerful effect upon his auditors ; but the reply
</p>
<p>of the Solicitor-General at once dissipated the
</p>
<p>momentary impression w^hich he had made.
</p>
<p>It was observed that a number of persons w^ere
</p>
<p>collected in the neighbourhood of the Sessions-

<p>TRIAL OF JAMES INGS.
</p>
<p>SESSIONS-HOUSE, OLD BAILEY.
</p>
<p>First Day, FruL:i/, April 2\, 1820.
</p>
<p>At eight o'clock in the morning the jurymen, who
</p>
<p>had been summoned, arrived at the Sessions-house,
</p>
<p>and, at nine, Lord Chief Justice Dallas, Chief
</p>
<p>Baron Richards, Mw Justice Richardson, and the
</p>
<p>Common Sergeant, took their seats.
</p>
<p>The prisoner, James Ings, was then put to the
</p>
<p>bar ; he seemed to labour under strong feelings of
</p>
<p>a,2:itation and had none of that firmness of aspect
</p>
<p>which he displayed on the former days : he was
</p>
<p>dressed in a suit of black.
</p>
<p>Mr. Shelton, the clerk of the arraigns, pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to call over the list of the jurymen, com-
</p>
<p>mencing at the name with wdiich he had termi-
</p>
<p>nated, when the jury in Thistlewood's case was
</p>
<p>impanelled.
</p>
<p>After a considerable number of challenges, both
</p>
<p>on the part of the crown and of the prisoner, the
</p>
<p>following jury was finally impanelled and sworn :
</p>
<p>Charles Pcj^ner,
</p>
<p>William iNIoore,
</p>
<p>Thomas Ik'ccham,
</p>
<p>John Beck,
</p>
<p>Benjamin Rogers,
</p>
<p>James Carey,
</p>
<p>George Smith,

<p>William Percy,
</p>
<p>John Young-,
</p>
<p>William Edgecombe.
</p>
<p>jMr. Shelton then proceeded to read the indict-
</p>
<p>jnent against the prisoner, which was the same
</p>
<p>already described in the case of Arthur Thistle-
</p>
<p>wood.
</p>
<p>My. BoUand, at a few minutes after ten, opened
</p>
<p>the indictment in the usual way to the Jury,
</p>
<p>Ihe Solicitor-General rose at ten o'clock to
</p>
<p>address the Jury for the prosecution. " It was
</p>
<p>hardly necessary for him, he said, to entreat their
</p>
<p>Bcrious and patient attention to the statement he
</p>
<p>had to make to them in the performance of his
</p>
<p>duty : they owed it to themselves, to their country,
</p>
<p>and, above all, to the prisoner at the bar. in
</p>
<p>justice to him, there was one fact now known, and
</p>
<p>to which he might without impropriety allude.
</p>
<p>One of the parties in this conspiracy had been
</p>
<p>ah'eady convicted. That circumstance they were
</p>
<p>bound not to let operate to the prejudice of this
</p>
<p>prisoner; towards his part of the offence they
</p>
<p>v/ere bound to look, not through the medium of
</p>
<p>any thing that had already passed in that Court,
</p>
<p>but solely through that which would this day be
</p>
<p>laid before them in evidence ; to that alone they
</p>
<p>were to direct their attention, and by that must
</p>
<p>they form their opinion of the guilt or innocence
</p>
<p>of the prisoner. On the law of the case it would
</p>
<p>be unnecessary for him to make a single observa-
</p>
<p>tion, for upon it not a single objection, not a single
</p>
<p>doubt, had been stated since this commission had
</p>
<p>sat. The charge against the prisoner, divested of
</p>
<p>all technicalities, was simply this, that he had

</p>
<p>conspired with others, by Ibrcc and violence, to
</p>
<p>overthrow the laws and constitution of the c(Hintry.
</p>
<p>This was to be effected by an extensive plan of
</p>
<p>assassination, and by other means which lie
</p>
<p>should hereafter mention.
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF IX(.S,
</p>
<p>'* 111 beli'dlf of the prosecution, he would plainly
</p>
<p>and simply nairrate the lucts as he knew they
</p>
<p>would be proved in evidenee. Ho would narrate
</p>
<p>them without the smallest exac>''j;"eration or distor-
</p>
<p>tion of tacts. T!i3 best i;-ift and pride of the
</p>
<p>pe(U)le was the pure and impartial administration
</p>
<p>of the laws of this country, and he would state the
</p>
<p>facts as they would soon hear them in evidence,
</p>
<p>and leave them to decide u[)on their applicability
</p>
<p>to the prisoner."'
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General then dotailed the evi-
</p>
<p>dence he had to adduce against the pi-isonor ; it
</p>
<p>was exactly as it is subsecpiently ^iven by the
</p>
<p>witnessess, and corresponded entirely with that
</p>
<p>given already on the trial of Thistlewood. When
</p>
<p>the learned gentleman came to that part of th.e
</p>
<p>evidence which described the conflagration that
</p>
<p>was to have been made on the night of the in-
</p>
<p>tended assassination, and the proclanaations which
</p>
<p>^vere to have been posted up on the night of the
</p>
<p>intended assassination, calling on the Iriends of
</p>
<p>liberty to meet, lor their tyrants, meanii;g the
</p>
<p>members of his .Majesty's government, were mur-
</p>
<p>dered, and in which they were called \ipon to rally
</p>
<p>round the provisional government which was then
</p>
<p>sitting; he oliserved, " what would not iiave been
</p>
<p>the situation of this great metropolis if this dread-
</p>
<p>ful project had been carried into ett'ect ?
</p>
<p>" Tiie ])eo])le would have seen pieces of artil-
</p>
<p>lery moving in different directions; thev would
</p>
<p>have seen a general conflagration; they would have
</p>
<p>heard of a provisional government, and t' ^ too
</p>
<p>rendered perhaps more terrible by the iiinorancc
</p>
<p>of the jH.'ople who were to com)H->x' it. It was

<p>impossible to judge wliat would have been the
</p>
<p>Tcsult of such a notification, lie was, indeed,
</p>
<p>willing to believe, that the people of this countrv
</p>
<p>were too sound to be eftecti'. , ly invited to rally
</p>
<p>round men whose projects were introduced to
</p>
<p>254 CAT0-3TREKT CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>them by the horrible and atrocious crimes of as-
</p>
<p>sassination and murder. He trusted that hitherto,
</p>
<p>at h}ast the natural indignation of Englishmen
</p>
<p>would revolt at any propositions coming from such
</p>
<p>a source, and to be sustained by such diabolical
</p>
<p>means."
</p>
<p>After detailing very minutely the evidence he
</p>
<p>meant to give against the prisoners (as it is here-
</p>
<p>after detailed), he informed the Jury they must
</p>
<p>hear it from one or more accomplices ; on the extent
</p>
<p>of whose credibility he made similar observations
</p>
<p>to those made by the Attorney-General in his
</p>
<p>opening speech on Thistlewood's trial, and dwelt
</p>
<p>on the comparative impunity with which dark and
</p>
<p>secret conspiracies would escape, if the evidence
</p>
<p>of an accomplice were not admissible.
</p>
<p>*' But even without this testimony, they had the
</p>
<p>imimpeachable evidence of Hyden, and also a
</p>
<p>number of facts which spoke for themselves ; and
</p>
<p>he would here ask, could any assignable cause be
</p>
<p>given for the meeting in Cato-street  the ammu-
</p>
<p>nition  the arms  but that given by the evidence
</p>
<p>which ihev would hear ? He then observed, that
</p>
<p>it was not because the plot was contemptible and
</p>
<p>ill-formed, and left so much to hazard, that there-
</p>
<p>fore its existence was to be disbelieved, the his-
</p>
<p>tory of all plots was of the same description ;
</p>
<p>they were generally characteristic of a total want
</p>
<p>of foresight and prudence, but though wild,
</p>
<p>though extravagant, yet if the project had exis-
</p>
<p>tence, and they were satisfied of the prisoner
</p>
<p>being a party to it, then they must be prepared,
</p>
<p>if the evidence carried conviction to their minds,
</p>
<p>to bring in a verdict of guilty against the prisoner,

<p>without any reference to the consequences of that
</p>
<p>verdict."
</p>
<p>The learned Solicitor's speech occupied an
</p>
<p>hour and ten minutes in the delivery.
</p>
<p>The following prisoners were then put to the bar
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF INGS. 255

<p>with Ings, to be identified : Davidson, Brunt,
</p>
<p>Tidd, Harrison, Bradburne, Strange, Gilchrist,
</p>
<p>and Wilson.
</p>
<p>EVIDENCE FOR THE CROWN.
</p>
<p>The witnesses to support the case thus de-
</p>
<p>scribed were then called ; but much of their testi-
</p>
<p>mony was similar to that given in the trial of
</p>
<p>Thistlev/ood. \\'e, thereibre, confine ourselves
</p>
<p>as much as possible to the new facts wliich came
</p>
<p>out, and which applied immediately to the con-
</p>
<p>duct of the prisoner,
</p>
<p>Robert Adams was first called, and examined
</p>
<p>by the Attorney-General. His testimony was
</p>
<p>almost in all respects similar to that on the former
</p>
<p>trial. He added, that he heard that the pike-
</p>
<p>staves which he saw in the room in Fox-court
</p>
<p>w^ere quite green ; he understood they had been
</p>
<p>brought from over the water ; Ings said he had
</p>
<p>brought them. The same evening Ings drew a
</p>
<p>pistol from his pocket. There was a conversation
</p>
<p>about the illness of the present King ; Tliisllewood
</p>
<p>said he would rather the new King lived a little
</p>
<p>while longer, but it was not their intention he
</p>
<p>should ever wear the crown.
</p>
<p>On this occasion Ings said, that the day the Prince
</p>
<p>Regent last went to Parliament, he himself went
</p>
<p>to the Park with a pistol in his ])ocket, with the
</p>
<p>sole intention to shoot him ; and as a test of his
</p>
<p>sincerity, he said, '' there's the pistol 1 took with
</p>
<p>me," alluding to the pistol he had previously pro-
</p>
<p>duced. He regretted he had not done it, and if
</p>
<p>he had, he should not have cared a farthing for his
</p>
<p>own life. Witness saw Ings at all the subsequent
</p>
<p>meetings.

<p>On the meeting held about the time of the
</p>
<p>King's funeral, when the plan for a rising was
</p>
<p>talked of, during the absence of the horse and
</p>
<p>foot guards, it was Ings and Brunt that said,
</p>
<p>nothing short oi' the assassination <>( {\\c km., s

</p>
<p>ministers would satisfy thein. Ings said, with
</p>
<p>his blood all of a boil, " that he must have them,
</p>
<p>(the ministers,) if possible, before tlie parliament
</p>
<p>was dissolved,"
</p>
<p>On the meeting held on Saturday the 2v0th of
</p>
<p>February, at which Tidd took the chair, with a
</p>
<p>pike in his hand, and at which Thistlewood pro-
</p>
<p>posed the murder of the ministers in detail, Ings
</p>
<p>was present, and said, " whoever has the lot to
</p>
<p>murder Lord Castlereagh, I am the man to turn
</p>
<p>out to murder that thief ! ^'
</p>
<p>On the Tuesday, at the meeting at Brunt's, wit-
</p>
<p>ness saw Ings pull three daggers from out of his
</p>
<p>pocket : he was asked what was the purpose of
</p>
<p>pulling out these daggers ? When he seized one,
</p>
<p>and making a sort of a rush, and a motion with
</p>
<p>his arm, said, with an exclamation, to "run into
</p>
<p>their bodies." After Edwards had commu-
</p>
<p>nicated the paragraph in The Neiv Times, resj^ect-
</p>
<p>ing the cabinet dinner on the Wednesday, and after
</p>
<p>Brunt declared his belief in a God, from his
</p>
<p>prayers being answered in bringing the ministers
</p>
<p>together, Ings exclaimed with exultation, tliat
</p>
<p>" he should have a better opportunity of cutting
</p>
<p>off" Lord Castlereagh's head."
</p>
<p>" It was subsequently arranged, that Ings should
</p>
<p>head the party to go into the room in wliich the
</p>
<p>ministers were assembled. He v/as to cut olf
</p>
<p>Lord Castlereagh's and Lord Sidmouth's heads,
</p>
<p>and to bring them away. Me was also to cut off
</p>
<p>Lord Castlereagh's hand, which he was to cure
</p>
<p>(pickle), as it v.'ould be thought a great deal of
</p>
<p>at a future day." He was to be armed v-ith a pair
</p>
<p>of pistols and a butcher's knife.

</p>
<p>The same afternoon, Ings was employed in
</p>
<p>making fire-balls to set fire to the different build-
</p>
<p>ings ; Edwards was making fusees to the grenades.
</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, February the 23d, tl^e
</p>

</p>
<p>Witness then described Ings's preparation for
</p>
<p>action, his brandishing his knife, and his sangui-
</p>
<p>nary declarations that he would cut off the heads
</p>
<p>of his Majesty's ministers, and bring away the
</p>
<p>heads of Lord Castlereagh and Lord Sidmouth in
</p>
<p>his bags. The handle of his knife, he said, he
</p>
<p>had bound round Mith wax-end, " in order to pre-
</p>
<p>vent his hand from slipping while he was at work."
</p>
<p>The witness then proceeded to detail the vv'ell-
</p>
<p>known occurrences in Cato-street, and the part
</p>
<p>which Ings took therein. IJe swore he would
</p>
<p>rather die or hang himself than not do the job
</p>
<p>that night.
</p>
<p>In cross-examination by Mr. Adolphus, witness
</p>
<p>said, I was born at Ipswich; I am now a Chris-
</p>
<p>tian ; there was a time when I was not a Chris-
</p>
<p>tian ; I was then a man in the same form as now.
</p>
<p>I was what they termed a Deist. I believed in
</p>
<p>(iod. I renounced Christianity and believed only
</p>
<p>in God. I re-commenced Christian after the 23d
</p>
<p>of February. I renounced my faith as a Chris-
</p>
<p>tian last August. I never pronounced my disbe-
</p>
<p>lief in God  nor ever denied Christ, till I read that
</p>
<p>cursed work of Paine's ! I never was an Atheist,
</p>
<p>but always believed in a God. I have no pension.
</p>
<p>The paper produced is my hand-writing ; I
</p>
<p>was examined here on ^Monday, and have since
</p>
<p>been in Coldbath-fields. I have had no com-
</p>
<p>munication with any body. I have had a room
</p>
<p>in the house of the Governor ; I have seen nobody
</p>
<p>that has told me any part of the proceedings in
</p>
<p>this Court. During the days when I was here,
</p>
<p>I was kept in a room by myself. Heard nothing

<p>conviction of Thistlewood. I had known Ed-
</p>
<p>wards from the first part of January. From the
</p>
<p>time I joined Brunt and the others. I never
</p>
<p>intended to commit murder, nor to give informa-
</p>
<p>tion ; 1 intended to wait for an opportunity to
</p>
<p>see if anv thing enabled me to creep out of it ;
</p>
<p>2 1.
</p>
<p>258 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>1 was prevented from creeping out, from threats
</p>
<p>that had been held out ; I was not disposed to
</p>
<p>plunder the shops, although I was in a society
</p>
<p>that were so disposed.
</p>
<p>Before I went into prison, I was asking Brunt
</p>
<p>what was the plan that was first drawn out ?
</p>
<p>Brunt said that nothing would be communicated
</p>
<p>till the day of action, and then the men would
</p>
<p>be called together, receive a treat, and be told
</p>
<p>what was to be done ; after which they would
</p>
<p>not be lost sight of. Brunt said, if he had any
</p>
<p>suspicion of any one giving information, he would
</p>
<p>run him through. This was on the 16th of Janu-
</p>
<p>ary. When I was examined on Monday, it did
</p>
<p>not come to my recollection about Ings telling of
</p>
<p>shooting the Prince Regent.
</p>
<p>Mr. GuRNEY : We studiously passed over
</p>
<p>certain points of the evidence for the purpose of
</p>
<p>shortening it.
</p>
<p>The Witness : I can tell many things, if I am
</p>
<p>asked, that I did not tell on Monday. If any
</p>
<p>thing fresh comes to my mind as I stand here I'll
</p>
<p>tell it. There were things that transpired that I
</p>
<p>did not state last Monday, and that I have not
</p>
<p>stated to-day. I had no personal knowledge of
</p>
<p>Monument. I can be answerable, that there was
</p>
<p>one candle in the room.
</p>
<p>I did not see more than one a-light. If a man
</p>
<p>spoke the truth, he could not say there were
</p>
<p>eight candles in the room. If any man said there
</p>
<p>was, I should say he was a false man. I cannot
</p>
<p>be answerable for every word which passed.
</p>
<p>I always found Mr. Edwards very deep, and
</p>
<p>very deep in conversation with Brunt and This-

<p>tlewood.
</p>
<p>There was a shot-hole in my coat from a pistol
</p>
<p>that was fired from the window, when I was
</p>
<p>escaping from the stable.
</p>
<p>I do not know a man of the name of Chambers.
</p>
<p>1 never called upon a person of that name in
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF INGS. 259
</p>
<p>company with Edwards. I did call with Edwards
</p>
<p>upon a woman at Pimhco, to buy a pair of boots.
</p>
<p>On that day I did not call upon any man of the
</p>
<p>name of Chambers to solicit him to kill his
</p>
<p>Majesty's ministers. I never said I would kill
</p>
<p>his Majesty's ministers, and have blood and
</p>
<p>wine for my supper. I never had any conversa-
</p>
<p>tion with any body to use Cashman as a watch-
</p>
<p>word.
</p>
<p>After the affair at Cato-street I did not take
</p>
<p>any ammunition away with me from Cato-street.
</p>
<p>Hall gave me a pistol and five rounds of ball-
</p>
<p>cartridges. I loaded the pistol, and laid it on the
</p>
<p>bench ; I did not touch it again ; and threw the
</p>
<p>four ball-cartridges away in the room.
</p>
<p>I never carried the lari^'e hand-2:renade. I
</p>
<p>cannot say that I can charge my memory with a
</p>
<p>score of words which Edwards ever said ; what-
</p>
<p>ever he said was always in a side-winded way
</p>
<p>amongst themselves.
</p>
<p>Eleanor Walker, on being examined by
</p>
<p>Mr. Gurney, gave similar evidence to that given
</p>
<p>by her on the former occasion.
</p>
<p>Mary Rogers, Joseph Hale (apprentice to
</p>
<p>Brunt), Thomas Smart (watchman in GrosveriOr-
</p>
<p>square), C. Bissex (also a watchman for the same
</p>
<p>place), Frederick Gillan, John Hector Morrison
</p>
<p>(journeyman to Mr. Underwood, the cutler, in
</p>
<p>Drury-^ane), Edward Simpson (corporal-major of
</p>
<p>the 2d Life-Guards), and James Aldous (pawn-
</p>
<p>broker), also detailed the same facts to which
</p>
<p>they before deposed.
</p>
<p>Thomas Hyden, the man who gave the in-
</p>

</p>
<p>In cross-examination, he said, he had been
</p>
<p>formerly a gentleman's servant ; that was six
</p>
<p>years ago. He lived with Colonel Bridges last.
</p>
<p>He might have lived with him a month or more.
</p>
<p>He could not certainly say. He had lived m

</p>
<p>IVIanchester-mews for five years. He had not
</p>
<p>been there all the time himself. He was away
</p>
<p>two or three months.
</p>
<p>He was now in the Marshalsea ; he was not
</p>
<p>ashamed of the place. It was for a debt of
</p>
<p>eighteen pounds, and due to Mr. Powell, a milk
</p>
<p>man. He went into prison last Saturday, on
</p>
<p>execution. He had been sued at the beginning
</p>
<p>of last summer. I was at home at different times
</p>
<p>in June, July, and August, at Manchester-mews.
</p>
<p>My family were there till last Saturday. I said
</p>
<p>on Tuesday last I lived in Manchester-mews. I
</p>
<p>am living now at this place where I stand. My
</p>
<p>family goes there now two or three times a day.
</p>
<p>I have known Davidson three or four months. I
</p>
<p>do not know Mr. Edwards.
</p>
<p>I know a person of the name of Edwards. I
</p>
<p>know a good many persons two hundred miles
</p>
<p>in the country. I have been to the Scotch Arms,
</p>
<p>in some small court somewhere down by the
</p>
<p>Strand. I was there twice, to the shoemakers'
</p>
<p>club, with a friend of the name of Clarke, a
</p>
<p>master-tailor. It was reported to be a shoe-
</p>
<p>makers' club. I am not able to say whether po-
</p>
<p>litics and the affairs of the State were the topics
</p>
<p>of discussion.
</p>
<p>I never was at any of the meetings in Fox-court.
</p>
<p>I knew nothing of the affair in Cato-street till
</p>
<p>told by Wilson ; I was to get the cream for a fa-
</p>
<p>mily in Princes-street, Cavendish-square. I have
</p>
<p>served them about three years, but I do not know
</p>
<p>their name. My wife brought home the order
</p>
<p>for the cream. I have been at the house, but I
</p>
<p>do not know when. It was the first time I saw

</p>
<p>said this more than twice.

</p>
<p>believe the house in Princes-street is No. 6. My

<p>there; I believe the house to be the front door

</p>
<p>Lord Harrowby appeared on the right of the
</p>
<p>Bench, and spoke to the interruption of cabinet
</p>
<p>dinners, and the issuing of cards of invitation for
</p>
<p>the 23d. His Lordshi]) named the company who
</p>
<p>were to be present. His Lordship then stated
</p>
<p>the receipt of Hyden's conmiunication, and the
</p>
<p>change of arrangements adopted in consequence.
</p>
<p>His Lordship, in cross-examination by Mr.
</p>
<p>Curwood, said, he had not personally known any
</p>
<p>thing of it belbre ; but he had heard a long time
</p>
<p>antecedently, that something of this nature was to
</p>
<p>be attempted.
</p>
<p>John Baker corroborated the testimony of Lord
</p>
<p>Harrowby as to the intended cabinet dinner.
</p>
<p>Jonx MoxuMEXT was next examined, and was
</p>
<p>again conducted into Court in the charge of two
</p>
<p>of the yeomen warders of the Court. His evi-
</p>
<p>dence u|^chief was })rccisely the same as that
</p>
<p>which he gave on Thistlewood's trial.
</p>
<p>In cross-examination, witness said, that Thistle-
</p>
<p>wood remarked, that every man would have
</p>
<p>equal honour with myself. I went to Cato-street
</p>
<p>for fear. I wa^ foolish, for I certainly went there

<p>without knowii]g what I Aras to do, 1 thought

<p>they were going to the House ol' Commons. Wlien

</p>
<p>RuTiivEN repeated his former testimony. In
</p>
<p>cross-examination, he said, he had no doubt there
</p>
<p>were four or five lights in the loft, and others in
</p>
<p>the little room.
</p>
<p>James P^Uis, William Westcott, Luke Nixon,
</p>
<p>Joseph Champion, John Wright, and William
</p>
<p>Charles Brooks, police officers, likewise repeated
</p>
<p>their former testimony.
</p>
<p>Capt. Fitzclarence.  The first thing he saw
</p>
<p>was a police officer, who cried out, " Soldiers,
</p>
<p>soldiers ; stable door, stable door !" He was met
</p>
<p>by two men at the door, one having a pistol,
</p>
<p>another a sword. He followed one of them into
</p>
<p>the stable, and took him.
</p>
<p>Serjeant William Legg, of the 2d regiment of
</p>
<p>Coldstream Guards, was at Cato-street ; saw the
</p>
<p>pistol levelled at Captain Fitzclarence, and seized
</p>
<p>it, when it went off. It was Tidd who levelled it.
</p>
<p>He took him into custody. He saw above on the
</p>
<p>loft, Cooper, Gilchrist, and Monument.
</p>
<p>Hercules Taunton gave evidence of the
</p>
<p>seizures made at Brunt's and Tidd's.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus.  A reward
</p>
<p>had been offered for the apprehension of Palin.
</p>
<p>He was not apprehended, nor Potter, nor Cook.
</p>
<p>Daniel Bishop was called, but not being in
</p>
<p>attendance, his examination and the production
</p>
<p>of the various articles seized was postponed till to-
</p>
<p>morrow morning, and the Court adjourned at eight
</p>
<p>o'clock.
</p>
<p>The Jury were then, as in the former case of
</p>
<p>Thistlewood's trial, placed in a room by them-
</p>
<p>selves, and not permitted to have conversation with
</p>
<p>any person whatever.

<p>Ings in the course of the day revived in spiritr,
</p>
<p>as he became interested in the evidence ; but he
</p>
<p>frequently reverted to a state of gloomy suV
</p>
<p>lenness.
</p>
<p>The other prisoners were anxious to keep "he
</p>
<p>witnesses out of Court, when not under cxarnna-

<p>Secoxd Day.  Saturuav, April 22.
</p>
<p>At a quarter before nine the Jury were con-
</p>
<p>ducted to the box by the sheriif 's officers.
</p>
<p>Shortly after this the guns, pistols, swords,
</p>
<p>pikes, grenades, ammunition, and other materials
</p>
<p>of war, seized in Cato- street, were brought into
</p>
<p>court, and placed on the table.
</p>
<p>At nine the same learned Judges who presided
</p>
<p>the day before, took their seats.
</p>
<p>Ings and the other prisoners were then put to
</p>
<p>the bar.
</p>
<p>Evidence foi^ the Crown continued.
</p>
<p>Daxiel Bishop was now put in the box, and
</p>
<p>described the circumstances attending the appre-
</p>
<p>hension of Thistlewood, which were detailed in
</p>
<p>his former evidence.
</p>
<p>In cross-examination by Mr. Adolphus : Witness
</p>
<p>said he had apprehended the prisoner from private
</p>
<p>information, not received from an officer ; he did
</p>
<p>not know a man of the name of Edwards.
</p>
<p>RuTHVEX was next called, and said there were
</p>
<p>now placed on the table the arms and ammunition
</p>
<p>taken in Cato-street; he then proceeded to select
</p>
<p>each article separately, and to exhibit it to the
</p>
<p>Jury ; the pikes and grenades were minutely
</p>
<p>inspected. A pike blade was placed in one of
</p>
<p>tiie handles in order to show the manner in which
</p>
<p>it was to be used. When thus presented it had a
</p>
<p>most terrific appearance. The knife stated to
</p>
<p>have been found on the person of Ings was next
</p>
<p>produced, and exhibited to the Jury. While they
</p>
<p>were examining it, Ings exclaimed, " It was not

<p>found upon me, my Lord,"
</p>
<p> Hector Morrison, servant to Mr. Underwood the
</p>
<p>cutler, identified tlie two swords which he icround
</p>
<p>264 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>for Iiigs. They were made extremely sharp from
</p>
<p>heel to point. The prisoner directed that they
</p>
<p>should be made as sharp as a needle at the point,
</p>
<p>and that they should be made to cut both at the
</p>
<p>back and Iront ; this was done. The swords
</p>
<p>seemed since to have been rubbed on a stone to
</p>
<p>make them keener.
</p>
<p>Samuel Taunton selected the articles found in
</p>
<p>Tidd's lodgings, as well as those found in the
</p>
<p>back room of the house in which Brunt resided.
</p>
<p>Serjeant Hanson, of the Royal Artillery, de-
</p>
<p>scribed the formation of the fire-balls and hand-
</p>
<p>grenades, and opened one of the latter, as in
</p>
<p>Thistlewood's case, for the information of the
</p>
<p>Jury. IJe also looked at the flannel bags found
</p>
<p>in Tidd's lodgings. They were what are termed
</p>
<p>flannel cartridges for a G-pounder. They were the
</p>
<p>same as those used by the Royal Artillery, only
</p>
<p>that those produced were farmed of flannel,
</p>
<p>whereas those used by the artillery were com-
</p>
<p>posed of serge.
</p>
<p>It was now announced that the other prisoners
</p>
<p>might retire, and they were re-con*ducted to their
</p>
<p>apartments.
</p>
<p>Serjeant Hanson,' examination by one of the
</p>
<p>Jury, said, that the grenades found in Cato-street
</p>
<p>were not made exactly in the same manner as
</p>
<p>those made for the use of the artillery, although
</p>
<p>they were calculated to produce similar destruc-
</p>
<p>tive consequences. The cart-nails would be pro-
</p>
<p>pelled with irresistible force by the explosion of
</p>
<p>the tin carcase, and would scatter death around.
</p>
<p>There was rather more powder in the case than
</p>
<p>was sufficient to burst a nine inch shell.

<p>The Attorney-General : That is the case on the
</p>
<p>part of the Crown.
</p>
<p>THE DEFENCE.
</p>
<p>Mr. CuRwooD then rose to address the Jury on
</p>
<p>behalf of the prisoner, and commenced by lament-
</p>
<p>TIIF.M 01 INCS. 2G;>
</p>
<p>ing the effect which the conviction of the last pri-
</p>
<p>soner must have upon their minds, however good
</p>
<p>their intentions, and however anxious they might
</p>
<p>be to decide this case free from all preconceived
</p>
<p>impressions. This circumstance, undoubtedly
</p>
<p>w^eighed heavily upon his (Air. C.'s) feelings,
</p>
<p>knowing that the construction of the human mind
</p>
<p>was such, as rendered it ahnost im]K3ssiblc to get
</p>
<p>rid of opinions once entertained. The disad-
</p>
<p>vantage under which he Uibourcd, in this respect,
</p>
<p>was the more distressing, ]3ecausc although the
</p>
<p>general features of this case bore a strong resem-
</p>
<p>blance to the last, yet it wanted a most material
</p>
<p>circumstance of contirmation, which was produced
</p>
<p>on a Ibrmer occasion.
</p>
<p>Sir Robert Dallas interposed, and objected
</p>
<p>to any allusion to wdiat had passed on the former
</p>
<p>trial. The Solicitor-General, in opening the case,
</p>
<p>had most humanely abstained from any reference
</p>
<p>to the former case, and had entreated the jury to
</p>
<p>dismiss from their minds the fact that another
</p>
<p>prisoner had been convicted. The Court was
</p>
<p>bound to treat this as a case depending upon its own
</p>
<p>merits, and his Lordship was persuaded that the
</p>
<p>Jury would forget that such a {)erson as Thistle-
</p>
<p>wood existed, and dismiss from their minds all
</p>
<p>knowledge of the former case, if they happened
</p>
<p>to liave heard any part of it.
</p>
<p>]\Ir. CuRWooD resumed, and said " he should
</p>
<p>bow with respectful deference to the correction
</p>
<p>of his Lordshij). His learned friend the Solicitor-
</p>
<p>General had told the Jury that, in stating the case
</p>
<p>for the prosecution, he was only anxious to acquit
</p>
<p>himself as a faithful servant of the public, by fully

</p>
<p>circumstances ; and that as far as his own j)ersonal
</p>
<p>feelings were concerned, he was regardless oi' Ihc

</p>
<p>friend the fullest credit for the sincerity of that
</p>
<p>statement. Though his (Mr. Curwoods) task was
</p>
<p>'2 M
</p>
<p>26G CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>much more irksome than that of his learned friend,
</p>
<p>yet he hoped he should have credit for the same
</p>
<p>feelings ; that he was most anxious, not only to do
</p>
<p>his duty towards the unfortunate man at the bar,
</p>
<p>but towards his country and his own character. He
</p>
<p>was sure that the Jury were also animated by the
</p>
<p>same feelings, and that whatever might be their
</p>
<p>private sentiments, they would form their judg-
</p>
<p>ment upon the evidence alone, and, if upon an im-
</p>
<p>partial consideration of that evidence, they found
</p>
<p>it did not bear out the facts charged in the in-
</p>
<p>dictment, would gladly deliver him, by their
</p>
<p>verdict of Not Guilty.
</p>
<p>** The Solicitor-General had also told them, that
</p>
<p>the law of the case was extremely clear. No
</p>
<p>doubt it was ; but it was necessary to point out
</p>
<p>the precise question for their consideration, be-
</p>
<p>fore they ventured to apply the facts of the case
</p>
<p>to that law ; because the question here was not
</p>
<p>guilt, or innocence in the abstract, for although
</p>
<p>there was strong suspicion against the prisoner of
</p>
<p>moral guilt, yet the question they had to try was,
</p>
<p>whether he was guilty not only of high treason, but
</p>
<p>of that high treason which was specifically charged
</p>
<p>in this indictment. In order, therefore, to enable
</p>
<p>them to discharge their duty fully and fairly
</p>
<p>towards the prisoner, they must not only take into
</p>
<p>their consideration the precise question they had
</p>
<p>to try, but also apply the evidence produced, in
</p>
<p>order to see whether the specific charge of high
</p>
<p>treason was made out,
</p>
<p>*' The history of the Statute of Treasons, 25
</p>
<p>Edw. III., was well known. It was passed in
</p>
<p>order to define what treason really was, and that

</p>
<p>the ignorance, and even cruelty, which had pre-
</p>
<p>viously prevailed upon the subject, by the erection
</p>
<p>of certain acts into crimes against the state,
</p>
<p>might be exploded. That statute contained a
</p>
<p>few short and distinct propositions, which in fact
</p>
<p>comprehended the whole law of treason. In the
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF THISTLE WOO I). 2G7
</p>
<p>language of Lord Coke it was called the blessed
</p>
<p>Statute, from the admirable regard mauifested in
</p>
<p>it for the liberty and safety of the subject. It
</p>
<p>declared first, that whoever should compass or
</p>
<p>imagine the death of the King, should be guilty
</p>
<p>of high treason ; and, second, whoever should
</p>
<p>levy war against the King and this realm, should
</p>
<p>be guilty of the like offence.
</p>
<p>" A number of other enactments of treason had
</p>
<p>taken place at different times since then, intro-
</p>
<p>ducing a most horrible system of cruelty and op-
</p>
<p>pression, but at length it was found necessary to
</p>
<p>return to that blessed statute. It was true, that
</p>
<p>in the reign of his late Majesty a statute passed
</p>
<p>for extending the law of treason. lie lamented
</p>
<p>that such a statute should ever have passed, and
</p>
<p>still more that any occasion for it should ever
</p>
<p>have existed. Upon both of these statutes the
</p>
<p>present indictment was founded.
</p>
<p>'* By the 23d of Edward III. it was made
</p>
<p>treason to compass or imagine the death of the
</p>
<p>King; and by the 36th Geo. III. it was made
</p>
<p>treason to attempt to depose him from his kingly
</p>
<p>office.
</p>
<p>" By the statute of Edward, it was made trea-
</p>
<p>i<on actiuilly to levy war ; and by the statute oi
</p>
<p>George, it was made treason to conspire to levy
</p>
<p>war.
</p>
<p>" The four charges, therefore, which they had
</p>
<p>to try, were these: Did the prisoner at the bar
</p>
<p>comjmss, or imagine the death of the King? Did
</p>
<p>he conspire to depose him from his imperial
</p>
<p>dignity? Did he actually levy war against his
</p>
<p>JMajesty? And did he conspire to levy war with

</p>
<p>an intention to compel his INlajesty to change the
</p>
<p>measures of his government by force? These
</p>
<p>were the precise issues they had to try, and
</p>
<p>whatever might be their o[uniou of his guilt, as it
</p>
<p>respected other charges still pending over hiin,
</p>
<p>and for which punishment would reach him if he
</p>
<p>2n2
</p>
<p>2G8 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>were guilty, yet unless they were conscien-
</p>
<p>tiously satisfied that he had actually committed
</p>
<p>some one of these four offences, they were bound
</p>
<p>to pronounce him Not Guilty.
</p>
<p>" It had been admitted by the Solicitor Ge-
</p>
<p>neral, that if the case in all its parts was not
</p>
<p>proved by unequivocal testimony, they were
</p>
<p>bound to acquit the prisoner; and he apologized
</p>
<p>ibr the evidence he proposed to offer, by saying,
</p>
<p>that in all cases of conspiracy it was necessary to
</p>
<p>have the evidence of some of the conspirators, in
</p>
<p>order to ascertain the purposes of their dark con-
</p>
<p>sultations.
</p>
<p>" This was another of the miseries resulting
</p>
<p>from a departure from the statute of Edv/ard.
</p>
<p>That admirable statute enacted, that before a
</p>
<p>man should be found guilty of the treasons there
</p>
<p>set out, he shall be ' proveably convict' of me
</p>
<p>same.
</p>
<p>" L^pon the meaning of the words ' proveably
</p>
<p>convict,* the great Lord Coke had written a whole
</p>
<p>section, shewing that they did not mean probably
</p>
<p>convict, but convict by the most unequivocal and
</p>
<p>satisfactory evidence.
</p>
<p>" The object of the statute, therefore, in making
</p>
<p>this wholesome provision was to protect his Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty's subjects, whose lives might be at the
</p>
<p>mercy of the most infamous of mankind. It was
</p>
<p>necessary, therefore, that the Jury should ex-
</p>
<p>amin.e the facts proved with the most scru})ulous
</p>

</p>
<p>finnution alluded to, was not meant to apply to col-

<p>lateral facts irrelevant to the matter in issue, but
</p>
<p>to the svhulc body and substance of the evidence ;

<p>and there fore if they found that the nuileiiai wit-

<p>iiesscs to establish tlic conspiracy were not con-
</p>
<p>firmed in the substantial part oi" their evidence, it
</p>
<p>was their duty to pront)unce a verdict of acquittal.
</p>
<p>" The leatned counsel admitted that there was
</p>
<p>suthcient evidence to establish an intention on
</p>
<p>the i)art of the prisoners to commit, perhaps, a
</p>
<p>dreadfid riot, to conmiit murder, and to etiect the
</p>
<p>destruction of houses ; but he strenuously urg;ed,
</p>
<p>that this was not suflicient to make out the crime
</p>
<p>of high treason, as alleged in the indictment. He
</p>
<p>adverted to the evidence of Adams, and other
</p>
<p>witnesses, and contended that it was wholly in-
</p>
<p>credible, and inconsistent in every part.
</p>
<p>" But supposing the cons})iracy which they
</p>
<p>had proved, really to have existed, he urged that
</p>
<p>it was the most ridiculous plot that could ever
</p>
<p>enter into the mind of the most infatuated man,
</p>
<p>considering; the absolute destitution of means to
</p>
<p>carry it into effect. The records of fiction and of
</p>
<p>history did not furnish an instance of such a wild
</p>
<p>and chimerical scheme.
</p>
<p>" After commenting with considerable inge-
</p>
<p>nuity, upon the evidence of the princii)al wit-
</p>
<p>nesses of the Crown, he proceeded to deprecate ii-i

<p>strong terms the doctrine of constructive treason ;
</p>
<p>and called upon the Jury, as guardians of their
</p>
<p>own and the ])ublic liberties, to make a stand

<p>against the further extension of this abominable
</p>
<p>doctrine, which had been condemned by Lord
</p>
<p>Hale, and some of the wisest judges that ever sat

<p>to administer justice. Returning again to the de-

</p>
<p>men, merely upon the evidence of such a self-
</p>
<p>convicted wretch ? He had stated to the Jury the
</p>
<p>danger to which our liberties and lives would be
</p>
<p>exposed, if a man could be convicted of high
</p>
<p>treason, on evidence like that which they had
</p>
<p>heard ; but as he preferred supporting himself in
</p>
<p>all cases by the authority of great men, he would
</p>
<p>remind them of what the present Solicitor-General
</p>
<p>had said, without telling them on what occasion
</p>
<p>the words to which he would allude had been
</p>
<p>spoken, or how long it was ago.
</p>
<p>" A witness was called to discredit the testi-
</p>
<p>mony of another. He, on cross-examination, ad-
</p>
<p>mitted, that he had accompanied a person to the
</p>
<p>Park, who went there for the purpose of extorting
</p>
<p>money from individuals, by charging them with
</p>
<p>certain practices. On this occasion the natural
</p>
<p>feelings of his learned friend, the Solicitor-Ge-
</p>
<p>neral, broke forth, and he inquired, * Would any
</p>
<p>honest man  would any man worthy of belief in a
</p>
<p>court of justice, accompany a person who went on
</p>
<p>such an expedition? Would any man, entitled to
</p>
<p>credit with a jury, agree with another in such a
</p>
<p>plan to extort money V This, in point of fact, had
</p>
<p>not been done by the witness to whom he alluded ;
</p>
<p>but he, Mr, Curwood, must beg to apply this sort
</p>
<p>of reasoning to the principal witness for the pro-
</p>
<p>secution, and ask if a man who had acted as
</p>
<p>Adams had done was entitled to belief in a court
</p>
<p>of justice.
</p>
<p>*' Was a man entitled to credit, who, like
</p>
<p>Adams, was an apostate, a traitor, a rebel, a be-
</p>
<p>trayer of his companions, a murderer, and an as-
</p>
<p>sassin  all of which he admitted that he had in-

</p>
<p>tended to be ?
</p>
<p>" Yet such a man had his learned friend put
</p>
<p>up on the present occasion. But who would be-
</p>
<p>lieve him, unless, indeed, it were made out, which
</p>
<p>no lawyer would say it was, that such a man was
</p>
<p>entitled to credit when he came into a court of
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF INGS. 271
</p>
<p>justice to seek the lives of men, though not in
</p>
<p>other cases, where his object was different.
</p>
<p>" If this principle were not established, then
</p>
<p>out of their own mouths was the principal wit-
</p>
<p>ness for the prosecution condemned. He called
</p>
<p>upon the Jury to look if he were confirmed, he
</p>
<p>would not say by good, but even by infamous
</p>
<p>witnesses. It was nothing that he was corrobor-
</p>
<p>ated in various insignificant particulars, but he
</p>
<p>was borne out in nothing that went to prove that
</p>
<p>the prisoner at the bar had committed high trea-
</p>
<p>son; and he therefore begged of them, under
</p>
<p>these circumstances, to give that verdict which
</p>
<p>would dismiss Adams with shame, as a man not to
</p>
<p>be believed in a court of justice on his oath.
</p>
<p>" If such a man were corroborated by other
</p>
<p>infamous witnesses, it would, in fact, be no con-
</p>
<p>firmation ; how, then, did the case stand when
</p>
<p>they found that he was not even confirmed by the
</p>
<p>testimony of those who were almost as infamous
</p>
<p>as himself. Having done with Adams, the next
</p>
<p>witness was Hyden, he described himself to have
</p>
<p>formerly belonged to a shoe-making club, and to
</p>
<p>have been introduced to Thistle wood in the month
</p>
<p>of February. And what was the first proposal
</p>
<p>made to him? Why, Thistlewood was repre-
</p>
<p>sented to have said, without any disguise or re-
</p>
<p>serve, " Will you be one to murder his Majesty's
</p>
<p>ministers ?''
</p>
<p>" Good God !  what must that man be whose
</p>
<p>heart would not revolt with horror from such a
</p>
<p>proposal ? But this person expressed no disgust
</p>
<p>at the plan with which he was thus made ac-
</p>
<p>quainted. Was this man then more worthy of be-

<p>lief, than one who would join with another to ex-
</p>
<p>tort money ?
</p>
<p>*' Was this, to use the words of the Solicitor-
</p>
<p>General, a man worthy of belief in a court of jus-
</p>
<p>tice ? The answer that his learned friend would
</p>
<p>leel disposed to give must be, that he was not.
</p>
<p>272 CATO-STREF.T COXSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>Then what confirmation could his evidence supply
</p>
<p>to that of Adams ? It was not necessary for him
</p>
<p>to go through all the details of the conversations
</p>
<p>between this witness and Adams, but he must
</p>
<p>remark, that of these not one word went to con-
</p>
<p>firm the facts that would amount to the crime of
</p>
<p>high treason, though they all tended to establish
</p>
<p>a plot to assassinate his Majesty's ministers.
</p>
<p>" It was true, that something was stated to
</p>
<p>have been said of seizing the cannon in the
</p>
<p>Artillery-Ground, and of retreating to the Mansion
</p>
<p>House. All this proved that a great riot was in
</p>
<p>contemplation, but it evinced no intention of com-
</p>
<p>mitting high treason. This witness described
</p>
<p>himself to have joined in the plan, and to have
</p>
<p>told the conspirators that he would be with
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>" The next witness was Monument. He had
</p>
<p>sworn that he was told by Thistlewood he ought
</p>
<p>to get arms, as all his (Thistlewood's) friends
</p>
<p>were armed. At that period it could not be
</p>
<p>denied, that there was a great ferment in the
</p>
<p>public mind, in consequence of the transa'ctions
</p>
<p>which had taken place at Manchester but a short
</p>
<p>time before.
</p>
<p>" Many of the warmest friends to the measures
</p>
<p>of government were of opinion, that an inquiry
</p>
<p>into those transactions ought to be instituted ;
</p>
<p>wliile others, without reserve, termed what had
</p>
<p>occurred at Manchester * a massacre,' and de-
</p>
<p>clared that since they were liable to be so dis-^
</p>
<p>persed at public meetings, they would attend
</p>
<p>ihcm armed, that they might be prepared to
</p>
<p>defend themselves. Thistlewood had used words

</p>
<p>to this effect. He (Mr. Curwood) would not
</p>
<p>deny that to go armed to such meetings, was a
</p>
<p>desperate resistance of the law ; but lie would
</p>
<p>maintain tliat it did not amount to liigh treason,
</p>
<p>and he entreated the Jury iicver to dismiss from
</p>
<p>their minds that it was for hi^h treason, and for
</p>
<p>THIAL OF INGS, 273
</p>
<p>high treason only, that they were trying the
</p>
<p>prisoner at the bar, and not for disobedience to
</p>
<p>tlie law in otlier respects ; and therefore if the
</p>
<p>facts proved did not amount to high treason, it
</p>
<p>would be their duty to return a verdict of Not
</p>
<p>Guilty.
</p>
<p>" The witness, Monument, had confirmed the
</p>
<p>evidence given of the existence of a plan for the
</p>
<p>assassination of his Majesty's Ministers, and for
</p>
<p>creating a riot ; but he proved nothing respecting
</p>
<p>that proclamation which was said to have been
</p>
<p>prepared by Thistlewood, and which alone went
</p>
<p>to give the conspiracy the character imputed to
</p>
<p>it in the present indictment. But the witness.
</p>
<p>Monument, he contended, had shewn himself
</p>
<p>during this trial to be the same unfeeling villain
</p>
<p>he had set out with being; yet, from the ag-
</p>
<p>gregate of infamy brought forward on this oc-
</p>
<p>casion, there resulted no proof of high treason.
</p>
<p>" Palin and Cook, who might be able to give
</p>
<p>evidence in favour of the defence, he shewed
</p>
<p>that he had no means of bringing forward, as, if
</p>
<p>they were to offer that testimony which might
</p>
<p>acquit the prisoner of high treason, they would
</p>
<p>bring themselves into peril, as the Attorney-
</p>
<p>General well knew that if they were to appear in
</p>
<p>the witness's box, they would not be suffered to
</p>
<p>depart with impunity, Eleanor Walker and
</p>
<p>Mary Rogers had only proved the taking of the
</p>
<p>room in which the consultations of the conspi-
</p>
<p>rators were held. This was not denied. It was
</p>
<p>admitted that they held consultations, and for a
</p>
<p>nefarious purpose ; 'but the question for the Jury
</p>
<p>to try was, whether or not these consultations

</p>
<p>related to high treason. Hale had also proved
</p>
<p>the room and the purchasing of some sheets of
</p>
<p>cartridge paper. This he (Mr. C.) contended,
</p>
<p>was wanting for their cartridges, Adams said it
</p>
<p>was for their proclamations, but of this there was

</p>
<p>274 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>no proof, and the fragments of cartridge paper
</p>
<p>that had been found were not written upon.
</p>
<p>" The three next witnesses proved various
</p>
<p>facts connected with the plan of assassination, but
</p>
<p>nothing that amounted to high treason ; and what
</p>
<p>was proved to have taken place in Cato-street,
</p>
<p>though murder and riot appeared to have been
</p>
<p>in contemplation, he could discover nothing like
</p>
<p>* a levying of war.* If they had not * levied war
</p>
<p>against the King,' conspiring to do that which had
</p>
<p>been done, could not be * conspiring to levy war
</p>
<p>against the King.'
</p>
<p>" This was a question which must be left to
</p>
<p>the understandings of the Jury. They all knew
</p>
<p>what war was between different states. It was
</p>
<p>carried on by large bodies of men, formed into
</p>
<p>companies, under the direction of proper officers,
</p>
<p>and accompanied by all the materiel of war. A
</p>
<p>civil war was the same, but that one part of a
</p>
<p>state in a civil war was opposed to another part
</p>
<p>of the same state. It would be for them to deter-
</p>
<p>mine whether enough had been proved to shew
</p>
<p>that any thing like war had been levied. It had
</p>
<p>been laid down by Sir Matthew Hale, that any
</p>
<p>disturbance was not necessarily a ' levying of
</p>
<p>war ;' for in that case every riot would be high
</p>
<p>treason. To constitute a levying of war, there
</p>
<p>must be something worse than a common riot or
</p>
<p>outrage; * there must be a species belli?'
</p>
<p>" Could the Jury find this on the present occa-
</p>
<p>sion ? The utmost force that had been mentioned
</p>
<p>consisted of forty men. These forty men were to
</p>
<p>be marched with unfurled banners through the
</p>
<p>city, to take two cannon in Cray's Inn-lane, and

<p>six in the Artillery Ground, and they were to
</p>
<p>possess tliemselves of ilie Mansion-house, Was
</p>
<p>this a levying of war ? Tliat the conspirators had
</p>
<p>been formed into companies was more than he
</p>
<p>had ever heard, and where was the money that
</p>
<p>was to canv <>n the war? In what holes and
</p>
<p>THIAL OF IN OS. 275
</p>
<p>corners had they hidden themselves that nothing
</p>
<p>was known of them ?
</p>
<p>*' From the circumstances to which he had
</p>
<p>called their attention, he would leave the Jury to
</p>
<p>judge how far the charge of levying war, or con-
</p>
<p>spiring to levy war against the King had been
</p>
<p>made out. In a former instance, if lie recollected
</p>
<p>right, the same cliarges were brouglit forward on
</p>
<p>a former trial that were now preferred, and in that
</p>
<p>case there were stronger circumstances  great
</p>
<p>bodies of persons had assembled, gunsmiths'
</p>
<p>shops had been broken open, and arms had been
</p>
<p>stolen from them ; yet in that case the Jury, not
</p>
<p>denying the existence of any guilt whatever, had
</p>
<p>rightly determined, as he thought, and as he hoped
</p>
<p>the present Jury would do, that the party accused
</p>
<p>was not guilty of high treason.
</p>
<p>'* He then shewed, that to endeavour to remove
</p>
<p>the ministers from their situations was not a
</p>
<p>crime ; and he argued, that to attempt removing
</p>
<p>them by force was not high treason.
</p>
<p>" He trusted the Jury would believe that he
</p>
<p>contemplated the plot to assassinate ministers
</p>
<p>with all the horror and indignation that such a
</p>
<p>design was calculated to inspire ; but he could not
</p>
<p>sacrifice his duty to his feelings, and he hoped
</p>
<p>that they would feel as he did, and feel how
</p>
<p>necessary it was for the safety of other lives, that
</p>
<p>those who were concerned in it should not for
</p>
<p>that offence be convicted of high treason. It was
</p>
<p>most consoling to him to reflect, that he should be
</p>
<p>followed by his learned friend, who would address
</p>
<p>them with much more eloquence than he could
</p>
<p>command.

<p>stances of the case, and see if they could find it

<p>proved by good, or even by bad witnesses, that

<p>there had been a levying of war. If they did find

<p>EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENCE.
</p>
<p>Thomas Chambers examined : I live in Heath-
</p>
<p>cock-court, Strand. I have seen a man of the
</p>
<p>name of Adams in company with a man named
</p>
<p>Edwards, about a week before the Cato-street
</p>
<p>business took place, in my room. They came
</p>
<p>together. They made a proposition to assassi-
</p>
<p>nate his Majesty's ministers. Adams and Edwards
</p>
<p>asked me to go with them. I refused. Adams
</p>
<p>said, " They were going to kill his Majesty's
</p>
<p>ministers, and that they would have blood and
</p>
<p>wine for supper." They came again on the
</p>
<p>Monday night before the Cato-street business
</p>
<p>took place. They brought with them a large
</p>
<p>bag.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney : I am a boot-
</p>
<p>maker ; I might have seen Ings, I am not certain.
</p>
<p>I cannot say how long 1 have known him. I don't
</p>
<p>suppose I have been in his company above twice
</p>
<p>or three times. The first time was at a place
</p>
<p>where they sold the Black Dwarf and the Medusa,
</p>
<p>kept by a man of the name of Watling. I cannot
</p>
<p>state where else I have seen him. I know a house
</p>
<p>called the Scotch Arms, in Round-court, in the
</p>
<p>Strand. I have been there three times, but did
</p>
<p>not see him. Those times were before Christmas.
</p>
<p>There was no chair there. There was no person
</p>
<p>sitting in a chair. There was no chairman. It
</p>
<p>was in no other room hut the tap-room.
</p>
<p>I have been at the Biack Dog, in Gray's-Inn-
</p>
<p>lane, once ; there was no chair there ; there might

<p>be about seven persons there ; it was on a Sunday
</p>
<p>night ; I cannot say whether before or after Christ-

</p>
<p>and that was Mr. Thistlewood ; I know Brunt
</p>
<p>very well, he was not there ; I don't think I know
</p>
<p>Palin ; I will not swear I did not see him ; I was
</p>
<p>at all the meetings in Smithfield ; I cannot state
</p>
<p>who carried the black flag ; I carried no flag at
</p>
<p>the last meeting ; I before carried two flags  one
</p>
<p>had inscribed on it " The Manchester Massacre ;"
</p>
<p>I never saw such a flag as " Let us die like free-
</p>
<p>men, and not be sold like slaves," I carried
</p>
<p>the flag inscribed " Trial by Jury,'' at Mr. Hunt's
</p>
<p>entry into London. I know Davidson. I have
</p>
<p>not much knowledge of Tidd. I know Wilson.
</p>
<p>I know Harrison very well. I have not much
</p>
<p>knowledge of Strange nor Cooper.
</p>
<p>1 have known Mr. Hunt ever since his triumphal
</p>
<p>entry into London. I was shocked at the propo-
</p>
<p>sition of going to murder his Majesty's ministers,
</p>
<p>at least so much that I did not go. Though Bow-
</p>
<p>street was so near, I did not go there to give
</p>
<p>information of the plot.
</p>
<p>Mary Barker spoke to Edwards's bringing
</p>
<p>grenades to Tidd's, her father's. There was one
</p>
<p>very large ball brought away by Adams.
</p>
<p>This was the whole of the evidence for the

</p>
<p>in vain. But I advance to the task with a clear
</p>
<p>mind, and faculties unfettered, because I can lay
</p>
<p>my hand upon my heart, and say, that no opinion
</p>
<p>I formerly offered is now changed.
</p>
<p>" The Solicitor-General, in his fervid opening,
</p>
<p>and my Lord, have told you, that the former case
</p>
<p>is to be kept entirely out of view. I say so ; but
</p>
<p>I know hov/ difficult it is to prevent the judgment
</p>
<p>from being influenced by the memory. I cannot
</p>
<p>help here contrasting the joy and alacrity of the
</p>
<p>Solicitor-General v/ith my own feelings. He told
</p>
<p>you, that he had to >ay before you, net what he
</p>
<p>hoped to prove, but what he had already proved.
</p>
<p>I have no such encouragement. It is for me a
</p>
<p>new case ; for Adams has, in this case, brought
</p>
<p>forward evidence which he thought proper to
</p>
<p>keep in his own breast on the former trial.
</p>
<p>" Much fervid declamation has been addressed
</p>
<p>to you by the Solicitor-General upon the conse-
</p>
<p>quences of success in the alleged plot. But you
</p>
<p>are to dismiss from your minds this speculative
</p>
<p>danger. The Solicitor-General has also stated
</p>
<p>propositions of law upon the subject of accom-
</p>
<p>plices with great eloquence, but with less accu-
</p>
<p>racy than might have been expected from his sta-
</p>
<p>tion and character. He asked, ' Has the accom-
</p>
<p>plice any interest in giving a deeper dye,-  in
</p>
<p>making a stronger point,  in carrying conviction ?'
</p>
<p>I answer, * Yes, yes, yes !' His impunity is con-
</p>
<p>ditional. He comes before you in chains, and in
</p>
<p>custody.  I refer to your own breasts, whether a
</p>
<p>man that can himself be yet prosecuted, has no
</p>
<p>interest in giving not true but acceptable evi-
</p>
<p>dence. The accomplice has the advantage too of

<p>prosecution, and he therefore swears boldly.
</p>
<p>" We are told, we might call Palin. Most

<p>stimulate the police-officers to find him, how

<p>should we find him, and persuade him to put his

</p>
<p>life in peril ? It is more a taunt than a kindness;
</p>
<p>more a reproach on our weakness than an essay
</p>
<p>on our strenglh. On the part of the prosecution,
</p>
<p>a witness has not been called who was proposed
</p>
<p>to be called ; and a w^itness that has been called
</p>
<p>has been withdrawn, when our witnesses have been
</p>
<p>on the floor to contradict him. This has further
</p>
<p>impoverished my poor, my destitute clients.
</p>
<p>The Attorxev-General objected to these ob-
</p>
<p>servations.
</p>
<p>Mr. Adolphls proceeded.  " Cook and Harris
</p>
<p>may be imaginary persons, and how could we call
</p>
<p>them ? If high treason in this case comes entirely
</p>
<p>from the mouth of an accomplice, 3'^ou cannot
</p>
<p>receive it. It is the whole of the charge ; and,
</p>
<p>if in that the accomplice is not confirmed, that
</p>
<p>charge is unsupported ; for, if you strike out the
</p>
<p>evidence of Adams, there is not one v/ord to prove
</p>
<p>treason.
</p>
<p>" Let me ask you to try his testimony, then,
</p>
<p>by these tests.  I. Is his account probable, or
</p>
<p>even possible?  2. Is his manner such as to
</p>
<p>entitle him to credit ?  3. Is he contradicted by
</p>
<p>witnesses for the prosecution ?  4. Is he con-
</p>
<p>firmed ? or is confirmation withdrawn ? Upon
</p>
<p>the first question, the learned Counsel argued
</p>
<p>with great force and animation, that the witness,
</p>
<p>Adams, could not stand any one of these tests,
</p>
<p>and therefore was not to be believed. It'," said he,
</p>
<p>any thing is to be gained by success in these pro-
</p>
<p>secutions, it is to strengthen the Government in
</p>
<p>the minds of the people ; it is to obtain applause
</p>
<p>for Ministers who have so vigilantly ])rotec'ted us.

</p>
<p>Adams has fathered upon others what he has
</p>
<p>himself done. Call Ings a murderer  call him an
</p>
<p>assassin  call him a felon  call him what you
</p>
<p>will  but, for God's sake, gentlemen, believe
</p>
<p>him." After some animated comment on the evi*
</p>
<p>dence of Chambers, the learned Counsel returned
</p>
<p>to Adams.
</p>
<p>" The meeting in Cato-street affords no evi-
</p>
<p>dence of the intention. Adams alone states it.
</p>
<p>The very situation of Cato-street, however conve-
</p>
<p>nient for the assassination, disproves the treason ;
</p>
<p>for it is two miles and a half from Gray's Inn-
</p>
<p>lane, and two or three miles more from the Man-
</p>
<p>sion-house. They never could thus have removed
</p>
<p>to the greatest possible distance from the points
</p>
<p>of action. What, then, are you to make of two
</p>
<p>bags to carry two heavy heads ? You cannot for a
</p>
<p>moment raise this into treason ; as well might
</p>
<p>you believe that an attempt was to be made to
</p>
<p>liberate the prisoners in this gaol by throwing
</p>
<p>cherries and carraway-seeds. Did they, then,
</p>
<p>levy war ?
</p>
<p>i " I recollect seeing a man convicted at that bar
</p>
<p>of the murder of a Minister of State (Mr. Per-
</p>
<p>ceval). I never can forget Sir James Mansfield,
</p>
<p>the tears streaming down his aged venerable
</p>
<p>cheeks, [f strong feelings could make the assas-
</p>
<p>sination of a Minister treason, that would have
</p>
<p>been treason. Suppose they had seized the can-
</p>
<p>nons, that would not be a levying of war ; for
</p>
<p>they are not the King's, but the property of pri-
</p>
<p>vate individuals. The Mansion-house and the
</p>
<p>Bank were not the King's. The only tittle to
</p>
<p>support the treason was the absurdity of a ' Provi-

<p>sional Government,' stated by Adams.
</p>
<p>" Some of you remember, as I do, the conlia-
</p>
<p>gration of houses, and the blazing of prisons, by
</p>
<p>a mob misled by an individual. The actors in
</p>
<p>that scene were tried, convicted of felonies, but
</p>
<p>not of treason. Their infatuated leader was
</p>
<p>TRTAF. OF I NO?, 281
</p>
<p>acquitted of high treason. God forbid that I
</p>
<p>should say my cHent stands ])erore you free of
</p>
<p>guilt. God forbid I should apologize for his
</p>
<p>conduct !
</p>
<p>" The evidence precludes me from denying that
</p>
<p>there was an intention to assassinate IMinisters.
</p>
<p>Poverty rendered the men desperate, and impelled
</p>
<p>them to crime. But treason is incredible and
</p>
<p>impossible. The whole hinged on Thistle wood.
</p>
<p>He had but lately got out of prison, havini^
</p>
<p>challenged Lord Sidmouth, who properly j)rosc-
</p>
<p>cutedhim, instead of accepting it. That he should
</p>
<p>entertain feelings of revenge was natural and ine-
</p>
<p>vitable, considering that his was a bad mind. But
</p>
<p>this is not treason." ' - -

<p>The learned Counsel having concluded his very

<p>282 CAT(-STREF.T CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>I lived in Portsea. I came to London in the be-
</p>
<p>ginning of May, 1819. I came with my wife and
</p>
<p>family. The reason I left Portsmouth was, that
</p>
<p>I was unable to get employ to support my
</p>
<p>family (here the prisoner seemed affected by
</p>
<p>his feelings.) When I came to London I thought
</p>
<p>I could get employ, but I was for a considerable
</p>
<p>time, and could get nothing to do. Knowing
</p>
<p>nobody I suppose was the reason. I had a few
</p>
<p>pounds with me when I came from Portsea.
</p>
<p>Finding my money going I did not know what to
</p>
<p>do. It did not go by drinking or gambling.
</p>
<p>*' I determined to get nito business, and I went
</p>
<p>up to Baker"s-rcw, where I set up a butcher's
</p>
<p>shop. I stopped there three nicntlis, from Mid-
</p>
<p>summer to Michaelmas ; the summer being hot
</p>
<p>was against me ; I lost a considerable deal of
</p>
<p>money in the course of the summer; I then took
</p>
<p>a house in Old Montague- street, which I opened
</p>
<p>as a coftee-shop ; in fitting up the shop my money
</p>
<p>was all gone ; I did not take money enough to sup-
</p>
<p>port my family. I now persuaded my wife to
</p>
<p>return to Portsea among her friends, where I
</p>
<p>thought she would be better than with me in
</p>
<p>London.
</p>
<p>'* After my wife had left me some considerable
</p>
<p>time, there was a man who used to come and
</p>
<p>take a cup of coffee at my shop. I had never
</p>
<p>nothing to do with politics ; but he began to
</p>
<p>speak about the Manchester massacre. I said
</p>
<p>very little ; I always took him to be an officer.
</p>
<p>He came frequently before I left the house.
</p>
<p>*' Some time after I met him in Smithfield. I
</p>
<p>went there to see if I could get any employ. He

</p>
<p>asked me how I did ; and I said very well. He
</p>
<p>said, he had been often to my house, and asked
</p>
<p>mc to stand treat. I said it was not in my
</p>
<p>]iower, and my reason was, that I had no money ;
</p>
<p>I added that I should be obliged to sell my things.
</p>
<p>He asked mc what thiny-s 1 had to sell, and I
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF IXC.S. 2S3
</p>
<p>told hini various articles. Uv agreed to buy a
</p>
<p>suia bedstead.
</p>
<p>" I tlieu went to live in Primrose-street. This
</p>
<p>was in January last. A lew days after, I met
</p>
<p>him in Fleet-market. He asked inc where wc
</p>
<p>could have something to drink ; and respecting
</p>
<p>the sofa bedstead, he said he thought he had a
</p>
<p>friend that would buy it. I took him to my
</p>
<p>house, but we could not agree. We came back
</p>
<p>to Fleet-street ; he then told me there was some-
</p>
<p>thing going to be done. I asked him what it
</p>
<p>was, and he said no good man would w^ant to
</p>
<p>know what was to be done before it was begun.
</p>
<p>We went directly and had some bread and
</p>
<p>cheese. He took me to the White Hart, where
</p>
<p>i saw a few of my fellow-prisoners. 1 asked who
</p>
<p>he was. I understood his name was Williams;
</p>
<p>but I since know that it was Edwards. He told
</p>
<p>me that it was he made Thomas Paine (the
</p>
<p>statue of Paine) at INIr, Carlisle's ; and it was
</p>
<p>the same man that did make it. He ai'terwards
</p>
<p>took me to another room where 1 got refresh-
</p>
<p>ment.
</p>
<p>" I did not know the particulars of any thing
</p>
<p>tliat was going to ])e done. 1 was a stranger, and
</p>
<p>went for food. That very day he brought me a

<p>sword to get ground for him. which 1 took tc the

</p>
<p>come up to the alley oj^positc Mrs. Carlisle's ;
</p>
<p>about six o'clock, I shall meet you tlicre." I went
</p>
<p>from there up to the room. I was there all day,
</p>
<p>and 1 got some bread and cheese.
</p>
<p>' At six I went to Fleet-street. He was sland-
</p>
<p>2o2
</p>
<p>384 CATO-STRECT CONSPIRAC5f.
</p>
<p>ing in the alley. I understand since, from the list
</p>
<p>of witnesses, that he lives in that alley. He told
</p>
<p>me to wait, which I did, for an hour. He then
</p>
<p>came and gave me a couple of bags and a belt,
</p>
<p>and asked me to come to the room in Fox-court.
</p>
<p>On my going there he told me that he was going
</p>
<p>to put some gin in the bags ; and that it was to be
</p>
<p>got on the sly. That was the sole reason that I
</p>
<p>put the bags under my coat, lest the patrol
</p>
<p>should see them. I went with him up to St.
</p>
<p>Giles's, where he said we were to get the gin.
</p>
<p>When we got there, he told me it was not there.
</p>
<p>We went up to Oxford-street, where he said a
</p>
<p>friend lived. He left me and I waited for him an
</p>
<p>hour. He then took me up to John-street, [ be-
</p>
<p>lieve it was, for I never was there before, to the
</p>
<p>stable. He told me I would see some friends there ;
</p>
<p>he then left me.
</p>
<p>" When I came under the archway, I saw Da-
</p>
<p>vidson ; Davidson took me into the stable. I
</p>
<p>never was up in the loft. I declare positively, be-
</p>
<p>fore God, I was not in the stable more than five
</p>
<p>minutes when the officers came in : there was only
</p>
<p>me there. Mr. Ruthvert, then, or somebody with
</p>
<p>carroty v/hiskers, and another, went up the ladder
</p>
<p>iiito the loft, and a third man came in, collared me,
</p>
<p>and said, " You are my prisoner." Very well, I
</p>
<p>says. Soon after he collared me, he began beat-
</p>
<p>ing me with his staff till my head swelled most
</p>
<p>dreadfully. In the mean time I heard a gun or
</p>
<p>pistol go off in the loft.
</p>
<p>" When he let me go and run out of the stable,
</p>
<p>I followed him into the street. On going into the
</p>
<p>street, an officer went after me, and I ran all down

</p>
<p>on the head with a stick as I was going towards
</p>
<p>liim. I ran from him, and with that I was pur-
</p>
<p>sued, wJien I was stopped by a watchman who
</p>
<p>beat me also. They took me down to the watch-

<p>house. That is all 1 know about the meeting.

</p>
<p>great energy.) The Attorney-General knows the

<p>before I was acquainted with it. (Still crying.)

<p>will see this man brought forward, or else I con-

<p>sider myself a murdered man. I knew nothing of

</p>
<p>never attended none of their radical meetings.
</p>
<p>I hope you will weigh well this in your minds

<p>before you return your verdict. That man Adams,

<p>But it was not so ; by the due administration of
</p>
<p>justice alone were they to pronounce on the guilt
</p>
<p>or innocence of the prisoner.
</p>
<p>*' The 36th of the late King was not calculated to
</p>
<p>introduce uncertainty and speculation. If the
</p>
<p>prisoners had the intention, and acted upon the
</p>
<p>intention, of levying war, it was treason, however
</p>
<p>inadequate their means. No man could doubt the
</p>
<p>truth of the story which Adams related. The
</p>
<p>learned gentleman then commented on the evi-
</p>
<p>dence at great length, insisting that the case was
</p>
<p>satisfactorily proved.
</p>
<p>Lord Chief Justice Dallas proceeded to
</p>
<p>address the Jury. This most painful inquiry
</p>
<p>having, in point of proof, been terminated, it
</p>
<p>became his duty to recapitulate the whole of the
</p>
<p>evidence, and to make such observations on the
</p>
<p>case as the different points seemed to him to
</p>
<p>require.
</p>
<p>** With respect to the indictment, it contained
</p>
<p>a number of different counts and charges, which
</p>
<p>were founded on two specific statutes. The first,
</p>
<p>an ancient statute, passed in the reign of Ed-
</p>
<p>ward III. ; and the second, a more recent act,
</p>
<p>passed in the reign of the late King. But, lo
</p>
<p>make the case as clear as possible, they might
</p>
<p>dismiss most of the counts from their minds, and
</p>
<p>look to the charge as composed of tw^o heads ;
</p>
<p>one, conspiring to depose the King, and the other
</p>
<p>conspiring to levy war to compel him to change
</p>
<p>his measures. He should now proceed to recite
</p>
<p>the evidence as he liad taken it. [The learned

<p>Judge here read the evidence of the whole of the
</p>
<p>witnesses, pointing out those facts which were
</p>
<p>most worthy the considerat-ion of the Jury.] The
</p>
<p>learned Judge then, in allusion to the testimony of
</p>
<p>Adams, observed, that, if the doctrines held that
</p>
<p>day could be adi)ptcd, no siu-h thing us an acconi-

<p>evidence would be at once got rid of, by stating
</p>
<p>that lie was guilty himself.
</p>
<p>" They were, however, informed, that though
</p>
<p>it was olten necessary to receive the evidence
</p>
<p>of an accomplice, yet in the practical application
</p>
<p>of that evidence, they were to view it with a
</p>
<p>suspicious eye. They were net to receive it,
</p>
<p>except it was confirmed. On this point he had
</p>
<p>heard the law grossly mis-stated.
</p>
<p>" The testimony of an accomplice ought to be
</p>
<p>confirmed in some particulars, but not in all ; for
</p>
<p>if they possessed the means of proving all he
</p>
<p>stated, there would be no necessity to call him to
</p>
<p>give evidence.
</p>
<p>" It was tor the Jury to say whetiier the pri-
</p>
<p>soners had not a revolutionary object in view. If
</p>
<p>they were asscm])]ed merely for the })urpose of
</p>
<p>assassination. (;f course the charge of treason was
</p>
<p>not made out, but if tliey tlio Light otherwise, un-
</p>
<p>doubtedly it v.'as. It might be said that it was
</p>
<p>impossible men could entertain such an extra
</p>
<p>vagant project ; if he had been told that there
</p>
<p>were twenty-five men on the face of the earth,
</p>
<p>and still less, of the country to which he had the
</p>
<p>honour to belong, who intended to commit the
</p>
<p>foul and dreadful act of butchery and blood
</p>
<p>wdiich had been described, he should have said,
</p>
<p>till they were detected, that it was utterly im-
</p>
<p>possible  that such a thing never had happened
</p>
<p>and never could. But looking to the evidence, it
</p>
<p>was clear and undoubted that such an occurrence
</p>
<p>had happened.
</p>
<p>" The prisoner had called witnesses before
</p>
<p>them, and he had implored the Jury, ere they

</p>
<p>In that request he went hand in hand. If they
</p>
<p>were of opinion that those persons assembled

<p>if, in the discharge of their duty, acting in the
</p>
<p>name of that Being who had been more than once
</p>
<p>appealed to in the course of this inquiry, they
</p>
<p>believed that the offence was proved, they would

<p>then, he was sure, fearlessly and intrepidly
</p>
<p>return with a verdict in conformity with their

<p>The Jury retired at twenty-five minutes after

<p>eight o'clock, and, at a quarter before nine, re-

<p>turned a verdict of GUILTY, ON THE FIRST

<p>TRIAL OF JOHN THOMAS BRUNT.
</p>
<p>SESSIONS-HOUSE, OLD BAILEY.
</p>
<p>Fiist Day, Mondaijy April 24, 1820.
</p>
<p>At nine o'clock in the morning, the Lord Chief
</p>
<p>Baron Richards, Mr. Baron Garrdw, Mr. Justice
</p>
<p>Richardson, and the Common Serjeant, took their
</p>
<p>seats.
</p>
<p>The prisoner, Brunt, was then put to the bar.
</p>
<p>He was decently dressed in coloured clothes, and
</p>
<p>had with him several papers, some of which were
</p>
<p>closely written upon. He looked rather paler
</p>
<p>than before, but preserved his accustomed com-
</p>
<p>posure.
</p>
<p>Mr. Shelton proceeded to call over the names
</p>
<p>of the Jurymen in attendance. The first name
</p>
<p>called, and to which there was no challenge on
</p>
<p>the part of the prisoner or the Court, was Mr.
</p>
<p>Alexander Barclay.
</p>
<p>Mr. Barclay stated, that, as he had been on
</p>
<p>the Jury by which Thistlewood had been tried,
</p>
<p>he hoped he might be excused on the present
</p>
<p>occasion.
</p>
<p>Mr. Curwood said, that it was because he was
</p>
<p>on the former Jury he wished him to be on the
</p>
<p>present, as he would be enabled to see the differ-
</p>
<p>ence of evidence.
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General said h: had no objection,
</p>
<p>Mr. Barclay was then sworn ; and he was
</p>
<p>foreman of this as well as the former Jury.

</p>
<p>Mr, Ciirvvood exhausted his right of challengins;'
</p>
<p>peremptorily before the Crown, on whose behalf
</p>
<p>the last four challenges were made in succession.
</p>
<p>As the Jurors were sworn, they were very atten-
</p>
<p>tively noticed by the prisoner. After the chal-
</p>
<p>lenges had been gone through, the following Jury
</p>
<p>was impanelled :
</p>
<p>* Alexander Barclay, of Teddington, grocer,
</p>
<p>(foreman).
</p>
<p>* Thomas Goodchild, Esq., North-End, Hen-
</p>
<p>don.
</p>
<p>* Thomas Suffield Aldersey, Lisson-grove, North,
</p>
<p>Esq.
</p>
<p>* James Herbert, Isleworth, carpenter.
</p>
<p>* John Shooter, North-End, Hendon, gent.
</p>
<p>James Wilmot, Western-road, Isleworth, mar-
</p>
<p>ket-gardener.
</p>
<p>* John Edward Shepherd, Eden-Grove, liollo-
</p>
<p>way, gent.
</p>
<p>* John Fowler, St. John-square, iron-plate-
</p>
<p>worker,
</p>
<p>* William Gibbs Roberts, Ropemakers'-fields,
</p>
<p>Limehouse, cooper.
</p>
<p>John Dickenson, Colt-street, Limehouse, builder.
</p>
<p>John Smith, John-street, Oxford-street, under-
</p>
<p>taker.
</p>
<p>John W^oodward, Upper-street, Islington.
</p>
<p>Those gentlemen to v/hose names a * is prefixed served on the
</p>
<p>tlr^t Jury.
</p>
<p>Mr. Bolland immediately proceeded to open the
</p>
<p>indictment against Brunt.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General then stated the case to
</p>
<p>the Jury, going over all the facts already detailed
</p>
<p>in the former trials, and commenting upon them

<p>with great clearness and ingenuity. As soon as
</p>
<p>he had concluded his address, the other prisoners
</p>
<p>(untried) were brought into Court.
</p>
<p>Robert Adams (the first witness against This-
</p>
<p>tlewood and Tngs) was put into the box. ;ind exa-

<p>mined by the Solu-itor-Cjeneral. He detailed tbe
</p>
<p>same story, in substance, which he gave on the
</p>
<p>former trials ; addini^ some tilings which he had
</p>
<p>then omitted, and varying a little his account of
</p>
<p>others. In the course of his evidence he came to
</p>
<p>that part where he described Brunt to have said,
</p>
<p>that, if any officers came in there, he (uttering an
</p>
<p>oath) would murder them, and they might be
</p>
<p>easily disposed of afterwards, so as to prevent
</p>
<p>their murder being discovered.
</p>
<p>Brunt, (rising hastily from his seat at the bar)
</p>
<p> My Lords, can the witness look me in the face,
</p>
<p>and look at those gentlemen (pointing to the Jury),
</p>
<p>and say that I said this ?
</p>
<p>Adams, (turning towards the prisoner, and lay-
</p>
<p>ing his hand upon his breast)  1 can, with a clear
</p>
<p>and safe conscience.
</p>
<p>Brunt.  Then you are a bigger villain than I
</p>
<p>even took you to be.
</p>
<p>The Court here interiered to prevent any further
</p>
<p>conversation between the parties.
</p>
<p>Adams then continued his evidence.  When he
</p>
<p>came to that ])art where he mentioned the hand-
</p>
<p>grenades, he added  " I think it necessary here
</p>
<p>to state, as Mr. Brunt thinks proper to deny what
</p>
<p>I have said, that he was the very man that took
</p>
<p>the hand-grenades to Tidd's house ; for 1 followed
</p>
<p>him all the way, and 1 saw, with iny own
</p>
<p>eyes, Tidd's daughter put them in a box under
</p>
<p>the window." [The witness uttered this with con-
</p>
<p>siderable emphasis and action.] In relating the
</p>
<p>arrangements which had been made for the murder
</p>
<p>of Ministers, and the subsequent proceedings
</p>
<p>which were intended, he added  ' 1 think it right

<p>to state one circumstance, which escaped my
</p>
<p>memory before. Ings proposed, that after the
</p>
<p>heads of Lords Castlereagh and Sidmouth were
</p>
<p>taken off, they should be })laced on a pole, and
</p>
<p>carried through the streets. Thistlewood im-
</p>
<p>proved the plan, and said that they should be

</p>
<p>292 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>carried on a pike behind the cannon in the
</p>
<p>streets, to excite terror. On this Bradburn ob-
</p>
<p>served, that, after they had used Lord Castle-
</p>
<p>reagh's head, they would enclose it in a box, and
</p>
<p>send it to Ireland.  Another circumstance which
</p>
<p>he also omitted before was, that, by an arrange-
</p>
<p>ment between Thistlewood and Cooke, it was
</p>
<p>agreed, that, if Cooke succeeded in taking the
</p>
<p>Mansion-house, he was to send an orderly to St.
</p>
<p>Sepulchre's Church, where he was to be met by
</p>
<p>another orderly, despatched by Thistlewood from
</p>
<p>the west-end of the town ; and they were to con-
</p>
<p>vey to the parties an account of the progress which
</p>
<p>each had made in their stations. ''
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood.  On my
</p>
<p>former examination I repented when I got home,
</p>
<p>and before that. When I perceived the error of
</p>
<p>my ways, I acknowledged it. Till I received that
</p>
<p>infernal publication, Paine's Age of Reason, which
</p>
<p>Tidd gave me, I M^as very particular. I was not,
</p>
<p>however, so good a christian as I might have
</p>
<p>been. The principles which Brunt, the prisoner
</p>
<p>at the bar, endeavoured to instil into my mind
</p>
<p>perverted my understanding. Brunt wished to
</p>
<p>throw down the pillars of Christianity altogether.
</p>
<p>I find my conscience satisfied at the atonement I
</p>
<p>have made to my Maker. My satisfaction did
</p>
<p>not m.erely arise irom getting my neck out of the
</p>
<p>halter. 1 never considered the assassinating of
</p>
<p>men, in cold blood, to be consistent with the
</p>
<p>principles of reason. On the 2d of January, the
</p>
<p>prisoner told me that it was intended to murder
</p>
<p>his Majesty's Ministers. I was introduced to
</p>
<p>Thistlewood on the 12th: durmg the intermediate

</p>
<p>jeriod often days, I had an opportunity of con-
</p>
<p>sidering the plot. I did not discover it, owing to
</p>
<p>the insinuations of Brunt. In that time, I attended
</p>
<p>several meetings, and was a chairman at one of
</p>
<p>them. Whenever I hinted any dislike to the
</p>
<p>business, the parties were like madmen. I knew
</p>
<p>rXlAL OK Bill NT. 293
</p>
<p>Edwards, and gaw him making hand-grenades.
</p>
<p>I intended to put a stop to the business if pos-
</p>
<p>sible ; but, at the same time, I wished to save
</p>
<p>these people, and to avoid the trouble of the
</p>
<p>trials here.
</p>
<p>Re-examined by INIr. Gurney.  My mind was
</p>
<p>perverted by Paine's Age of Reason, and Garbles
</p>
<p>publication.
</p>
<p>Eleanor Walker, Mary Rogers, Joseph Hale,
</p>
<p>Thomas Sharp, Gharles Bisset, Henry Gillam,
</p>
<p>Edward Simpson, and J. H. Morrison, gave
</p>
<p>precisely the same evidence as they had given
</p>
<p>on the former trials.
</p>
<p>John Moxumext, the accomplice, was brought
</p>
<p>into Gourt in the custody of two wardens of the
</p>
<p>Tower. He was examined by the Solicitor-
</p>
<p>General, and gave precisely the same evidence
</p>
<p>as he had done on the two preceding trials, rela-
</p>
<p>tive to his connexion with the conspirators.
</p>
<p>Gross-examined by ]\Ir. Curwood.  I have read
</p>
<p>Paine"s Age of Reason. It rather shook my faith ;
</p>
<p>but it did not destroy it, because it was accom-
</p>
<p>panied by the Bishop of Llandaff's Apology for the
</p>
<p>Bible.
</p>
<p>Thomas Monument, examined by the Solicitor-
</p>
<p>General.  His testimony to-day was precisely the
</p>
<p>same with that which he had given on the former
</p>
<p>day, and fully corroborated that of his brother.
</p>
<p>He was not cross-examined.
</p>
<p>John Monument -^'as then re-called, and re-
</p>
<p>examined by the Solicitor-General, as to the
</p>
<p>advice which had been given him by Thistlewood
</p>
<p>to say that Edwards had taken him to the meeting.
</p>
<p>He repeated his former testimony, and added,

<p>that Thistlewood told him to pass it round to the
</p>
<p>other prisoners, that it was Edwards who had
</p>
<p>betrayed them. Bradburn paid no attention to
</p>
<p>this advice.
</p>
<p>Thomas Hvdex, examined by ]Mr. Gurney,
</p>
<p>repeated his former evidence. This is the man
</p>
<p>294 CATO-SrillLET CONSPlRACr.
</p>
<p>who gave information of the plot to Lords Har-
</p>
<p>rowby and Castlereagh, of which he on this occa-
</p>
<p>sion gave a detailed account.
</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood.  I know a
</p>
<p>man of the name of Bennett, a bricklayer. I
</p>
<p>asked him to go with me to the shoemakers' club.
</p>
<p>I cannot swear that I did not ask him to go there,
</p>
<p>because something was to be done there for the
</p>
<p>good of the country. I wrote to Lord Harrowby
</p>
<p>myself.
</p>
<p>Here the learned Counsel asked him to write a
</p>
<p>word or two. He did so. Mr. Curwood observed,
</p>
<p>that he asked the question because he had been
</p>
<p>informed that the witness could not write. He
</p>
<p>had been mis-informed, and had now done with
</p>
<p>the witness.
</p>
<p>After the examination of this witness had
</p>
<p>closed, he evinced a disposition to stay in Court,
</p>
<p>on which the prisoner. Brunt, observed, " My
</p>
<p>Lord, the witness stays in Court." Wilson then
</p>
<p>rose, and said, with great indignation, " My
</p>
<p>Lord, let that perjured villain be turned out of
</p>
<p>Court." He then took his departure.
</p>
<p>The ^Earl of Harrowby was next called, and
</p>
<p>repeated his former evidence.
</p>
<p>John Baker, the butler to the Earl of Har-
</p>
<p>rowby, corroborated his Lordship's evidence.
</p>
<p>Richard Munday and George Caylock
</p>
<p>proved the presence of the prisoner in Cato-
</p>
<p>street on the evening on w^iich the plot was dis-
</p>
<p>covered.
</p>
<p>George Ruthven, James Ellis, Thomas
</p>
<p>Westcott, and others belonging to the police-
</p>
<p>office in .Bow-street, were then examined as to

</p>
<p>the seizure of the gang in Cato-street.
</p>
<p>Captain Fitzclarence repeated the evidence
</p>
<p>which he had given on the former trial.
</p>
<p>Mr. Gurney then stated to the Court, that the
</p>
<p>case for the prosecution was closed, except so
</p>
<p>far as related to the examination of the arms,
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF BRUNT. 295
</p>
<p>ammunition, ^c, which had been seized either in
</p>
<p>Cato-street, or on the premises of the conspi-
</p>
<p>rators. It would be more prudent to examine
</p>
<p>them bv day-liaht.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief-Baron acquiesced in the pro-
</p>
<p>position, and adjourned the Court till the next
</p>
<p>day at nine o'clock.
</p>
<p>Secoxd Day.  Tuesday, Apinl 25.
</p>
<p>At nine o'clock in the morning the proceedings
</p>
<p>were resumed. The arms and ammunition were
</p>
<p>brought in, and underwent an inspection in pre-
</p>
<p>sence of the Jury.
</p>
<p>Mr. GuRXEY proceeded to call
</p>
<p>George Ruth vex, who had seized the arms
</p>
<p>found in Cato-street. He identified certain arms
</p>
<p>placed on the table of the Court as the arms
</p>
<p>which he had seized, and repeated the evidence
</p>
<p>which he had given on the former trials. He also
</p>
<p>produced the grenades.
</p>
<p>Hector Morriso.v said, that he had sharpened
</p>
<p>a sw^ord, which was produced to him, from heel
</p>
<p>to point, by desire of Ings.
</p>
<p>Samuel Tauxtox produced several pike-
</p>
<p>heads, fire-balls, cartridges, ^-c, which were
</p>
<p>found at Brunt's and Tidds lodgings, and re-
</p>
<p>peated his former evidence.
</p>
<p>Serceaxt Haxson described the composition
</p>
<p>of the fire-balls, and opened one of the grenades
</p>
<p>for the satisfaction of the Jury. It contained
</p>
<p>twenty-five pieces of old iron, lie stated, that it
</p>
<p>was quite clear that it had not been made by any
</p>
<p>military man. His evidence was the same as it
</p>

<p>The case for the prosecution was then closed.

<p>296 CATO-STREET CO N'SPUt A C V.
</p>
<p>THE DEFENCE.
</p>
<p>Mr. CuRwooD addressed the Jury on behalf of
</p>
<p>the prisoner, and urged all those topics already-
</p>
<p>detailed in his former speeches. He concluded
</p>
<p>by calling a witness of the name of John
</p>
<p>Benxett, who was accordingly sworn and put
</p>
<p>into the box, but before his examination coifi-
</p>
<p>menced,
</p>
<p>Mr. Gurney begged to ask the purpose for
</p>
<p>which this witness was called.
</p>
<p>Mr. Curwood stated, that he was to contradict
</p>
<p>part of the testimony given by the witness Hyden,
</p>
<p>in his cross-examination.
</p>
<p>Mr. Gurney observed, that he had a few ob-
</p>
<p>servations to make regarding the relevancy of
</p>
<p>the evidence of this witness, and therefore
</p>
<p>desired that he might be ordered to withdraw for
</p>
<p>a few moments from Court.
</p>
<p>The witness accordingly withdrew.
</p>
<p>Mr. Gurney then observed, that he conceived
</p>
<p>that this witness was called to prove that Hyden
</p>
<p>had asked him to go with him to the shoemakers'-
</p>
<p>club, because something would be done there for
</p>
<p>the good of the country. Nov/ Hyden refused to
</p>
<p>swear that he had not used such expressions ;
</p>
<p>he said that he thought that he had not, but he
</p>
<p>could not positively tell. Supposing then that
</p>
<p>Bennett were to prove the words imputed by the
</p>
<p>learned Counsel to Hyden, he would not prove
</p>
<p>any thing which would invalidate Hyden's
</p>
<p>testimony. He therefore hoped that his learned
</p>
<p>friend would not waste the time of the Court bv
</p>
<p>calling this witness.
</p>
<p>Mr. Curwood stated, that Hyden had sworn

</p>
<p>that he had never made use of the words imputed
</p>
<p>to him. He, therefore, intendpd tn rail x^j-iri/nr./-^
</p>
<p>to prove that he had.
</p>

</p>
<p>The Judges then referred to their notes, and
</p>
<p>after examination of them, said that Mr. Curwood
</p>
<p>was mistaken in his opinion as to Hyden's words ;
</p>
<p>they were to the effect stated by Mr. Gurney.
</p>
<p>Mr. Curwood then dechncd to call Bennet,
</p>
<p>and said that he had no other witness to ex-
</p>
<p>amine.
</p>
<p>Mr. Adolpuus then shortly addressed the
</p>
<p>Jury on the same side with Mr. Curwood. He
</p>
<p>took a comprehensive view of the whole of the
</p>
<p>evidence ; denied that the evidence of Adams,
</p>
<p>the accomplice, was entitled to the slightest
</p>
<p>credit ; and contended that, as it was not sup-
</p>
<p>ported by more credible witnessess, the offence
</p>
<p>of which the prisoner had been guilty, however
</p>
<p>great, did not amount to the charge in the in-
</p>
<p>dictment of high treason. lie concluded his
</p>
<p>address, in which he displayed much zeal and
</p>
<p>ability, by appealing to the Jury on the danger
</p>
<p>to society of receiving the unsupported evidence
</p>
<p>of an avowed accomplice, in a crime of a nature
</p>
<p>so serious as that with which the prisoner stood
</p>
<p>charged. He entreated them not to convict the
</p>
<p>prisoner because he was a bad man, but to ex-
</p>
<p>amine how far the charge against him had been
</p>
<p>substantiated.
</p>
<p>A Juror rose and observed, that there was no
</p>
<p>evidence in the present case of the ammunition
</p>
<p>having been brouglit back to Brunt's house.
</p>
<p>The Chief-Baron said there was iu)t, or of
</p>
<p>several other matters alleged, which he would
</p>
<p>advert to afterwards.
</p>
<p>Mr. Adolphus said he had no intention of over-
</p>
<p>stating any point; that he had been unavoidably

<p>absent during part of the trial, and that might
</p>
<p>have occasioned some inaccuracies 
</p>
<p>The Solicitor-General interposed, and Mr
</p>
<p>Adolphus sat down without any further remark.
</p>
<p>While Mr. Adolphus ^^as (ielivering his address,

<p>298 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>Mr. Harmer's clerk delivered to the prisoner a
</p>
<p>written paper, which he began to read ; but he
</p>
<p>did not seem to view its contents with much
</p>
<p>attention.
</p>
<p>The Chief Baron addressing the prisoner, said,
</p>
<p>" John Thomas Brunt; your learned counsel
</p>
<p>have concluded their very able defence ; but if
</p>
<p>you wish to say any thing in your own defence,
</p>
<p>this is the time."
</p>
<p>The prisoner then rose and spoke as follows : 
</p>
<p>*' My Lord, I have had a defence put into my
</p>
<p>hands only a few minutes ago, which I have not
</p>
<p>had time to peruse over. Yet I have two or three
</p>
<p>observations to make respecting the evidence 
</p>
<p>particularly respecting the evidence of Monu-
</p>
<p>ment. It's quite useless for me to deny that I
</p>
<p>was in the room in Cato-street ; but immediately
</p>
<p>on the arrival of Monument in Cato-street, he ap-
</p>
<p>proached me, and asked me what was going to be
</p>
<p>done, when he saw the arms on the bench ; to
</p>
<p>which I replied, that I was not aware of any thing-
</p>
<p>being going to be done, for that Edwards had not
</p>
<p>brought so many men by thirty as he stated he
</p>
<p>would bring, and that it was not my intention to
</p>
<p>endeavour to do any thing with so few men. I
</p>
<p>would not be led by any individual. Accordingly,
</p>
<p>perceiving that Monument betrayed a great deal
</p>
<p>of fear, I persuaded him to go away.
</p>
<p>" My Lord, a considerable stress has been laid
</p>
<p>upon what I said respecting the number of men
</p>
<p>who were to go to Lord Harrowby's house. This
</p>
<p>I declare was not true. I will admit, my Lord,
</p>
<p>that when Thistlewood, as has been stated, ad-
</p>
<p>dressed himself to the few men who were there,

</p>
<p>and spoke, as the witness said, that if they did
</p>
<p>not go it would be another Despard job, that some
</p>
<p>few men did go into the small room; but, my
</p>
<p>Lord, it never came into my mind, I solemnly
</p>
<p>protest, to go there. They were endeavouring to
</p>
<p>see if fourteen or fifteen men were disposed to go
</p>
<p>rruAi. OF BUiJXT. 299
</p>
<p>to the square ; but I would not agree to a plan
</p>
<p>which I knew must expose these few individuals
</p>
<p>to instant death.
</p>
<p>" I will now call your Lordship's attention to
</p>
<p>two circumstances respecting the conduct of
</p>
<p>myself. In the first place, Adams says, in order
</p>
<p>to implicate me more deeply, that 1 declared that
</p>
<p>I would go into the room and blow the house about
</p>
<p>their ears. This, my Lord, is false. For you see
</p>
<p>that when Monument comes forward, he makes a
</p>
<p>declaration to you, gentlemen of the Jury, that I
</p>
<p>declared I would go myself and bury myself in
</p>
<p>the ruins. Is this consistent ?  is it upon such
</p>
<p>evidence as this, that you will deprive a son of a
</p>
<p>father, and a wife of a husband ?
</p>
<p>" 1 should wish to advert to another circum-
</p>
<p>stance. While I was in Coldbatli-fields prison, 
</p>
<p>when I was there for nearly three days, during
</p>
<p>which I was scarcely out of my room, even to
</p>
<p>wash myself. When I came down out of my
</p>
<p>room to the fire I saw Monument; I saw Strange;
</p>
<p>I saw Cooper; I saw Bradburn. Monument, my
</p>
<p>Lord, came to me, and sat himself down close by
</p>
<p>mt, and whispered in my car these words: he
</p>
<p>said, ' What did you say when you came before
</p>
<p>the Privy Council V 1 says, * That I said I knew
</p>
<p>nothing about the matter.' This, my Lord, in-
</p>
<p>duced me to ask INlonument what he said ? and I
</p>
<p>says, * ^^ hat did you say? upon which ho says,
</p>
<p>* I could sav nothiiig  you told me nothing. M liy
</p>
<p>did you not tell me more ?' ! says, ' It were im-
</p>
<p>possible for me to tell you what I did not know
</p>
<p>myself. You know very well, that when you saw
</p>
<p>the man call on us to go into the small room I de-

</p>
<p>clined.'
</p>
<p>'' I admit, as v/as said by Adams, that I was
</p>
<p>one that was named to go to the house; but,
</p>
<p>gentlem.en of the Jury, you were not told that he
</p>
<p>was the villain who so named me, and that he
</p>
<p>constantly came to my house twice a-day, although
</p>
<p>300 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACi'.
</p>
<p>he now conies to give evidence to deprive me of
</p>
<p>my life.
</p>
<p>" I am no traitor  I v^as determined, w^hen I
</p>
<p>entered into this base plot, that I would lose my
</p>
<p>life sooner than I would betray an individual. I
</p>
<p>would be put to death  I would die on the rack,
</p>
<p>rather than 1 would betray a fellow-creature.
</p>
<p>This is my principle. This shews the intention
</p>
<p>of Monument to betray me.
</p>
<p>" Now, my Lord, I come to advert to a circum-
</p>
<p>stance which occurred to me at Cambray, in
</p>
<p>France. It becomes me to state any thing which
</p>
<p>may be of use to me and my fellow-prisoners.
</p>
<p>While I was in Cambray, in France, my Lord, I
</p>
<p>met Adams when I first came from Paris. Adams
</p>
<p>worked for the officers, and I assisted him in work
</p>
<p>which he was incapable of performing himself.
</p>
<p>He afterwards became so jealous, that he threat-
</p>
<p>ened to take my life, and I was obliged to leave
</p>
<p>the house, which I did, and I never worked for
</p>
<p>him again. I afterwards went from Cambray to
</p>
<p>Lisle, where I worked for an English tradesman
</p>
<p>of Ihe name of Brailsford. I worked for him two
</p>
<p>or three months, until I got a little money. During
</p>
<p>this time I kncv/ nothing of Adams.
</p>
<p>" When I came home 1 iound that my wife had
</p>
<p>lost her senses, and was in St. Luke's, in conse-
</p>
<p>quence of her having heard that my son and
</p>
<p>myself had been assassinated in France. I settled
</p>
<p>myself, and my wife shortly after came out. 1
</p>
<p>got a good seat of work, and at this time I was
</p>
<p>persuaded to receive, as my apprentice, Hale, the
</p>
<p>witness, who has been called to you.
</p>
<p>Here the prisoner entered into some details

<p>relative to the character of the relations of Hale,
</p>
<p>in which he was interrupted by the Chief Baron,
</p>
<p>upon the principle, that these persons were in no
</p>
<p>way connected with the ])resent case. He then
</p>
<p>went on to detail a variety of acts on the part of
</p>
<p>his apprentice, all tending to ])rove him a person
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF CRUNT. 301
</p>
<p>of bad character, and unworthy of credit, to which
</p>
<p>he said, if he had the means, he could bring evi-
</p>
<p>dence. He then spoke as follows : 
</p>
<p>" Of Ilyden 1 know nothing'. Here he again
</p>
<p>referred to the written defence with whicti he had
</p>
<p>been furnished. He said he had not had time to
</p>
<p>read it, but continued.
</p>
<p>" I wish to advert to a person of the name of
</p>
<p>Edwards, who was the first person that ever insti-
</p>
<p>gated me to enter into this snare. This Mr. Ed-
</p>
<p>wards I first saw in company with Mr. Thistle-
</p>
<p>w^ood, at the White Lyon in Wych-street. This
</p>
<p>Edwards came to my lodging in Fox-court. I
</p>
<p>was very short of work, and he used frequently to
</p>
<p>call on me  such a thing as two or three times
</p>
<p>a-day ; and this was long before the back room was
</p>
<p>taken. If I was not at home he would wait for
</p>
<p>me ; and often followed me to places where I went
</p>
<p>for work. This was the case at the house of a
</p>
<p>gentleman of the name of Scott, wdio saw him,
</p>
<p>and asked me if he was waiting for me ? and said,
</p>
<p>* Why does he not come in?'
</p>
<p>" This man constantly harassed me, and often-
</p>
<p>times, my Lord, he supplied me with money. He
</p>
<p>told me, and I can bring other people to prove it,
</p>
<p>that lie said that if he could get a hundred such
</p>
<p>men as me, he could do anv thing. He considered
</p>
<p>me a staunch man, my Lord, and thought, I sup-
</p>
<p>])ose, that I was a fit man to make a prey of. He
</p>
<p>often took me out to call on people, and to treat
</p>
<p>them with drink. This was his constant practice.
</p>
<p>l[e was continually with me before this business;
</p>
<p>and I solemnly declare, that this was the indi-
</p>
<p>vidual, and not Mr. Thistlew^ood, who brought me

<p>into this plot.
</p>
<p>" 1 must now, my Lord, adv(M't t( what took
</p>
<p>jiiace in Cato-street, and to his (Edwards's) con-
</p>
<p>cU'.ct on that evenhig. I will state nothing but the
</p>
<p>n-.!th.
</p>
<p>" a;-. Lord, from the ditlcrcnt favours I re-
</p>
<p>302 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>ceil ed from Edwards, I had a good opinion of
</p>
<p>the man. When the officers came up into the
</p>
<p>room in Cato-street, I made my escape in the
</p>
<p>best manner I could. .5 I did not make my escape,
</p>
<p>however, hke a coward or a traitor, I did not
</p>
<p>desert my companions. I went immediately to
</p>
<p>Grosvenor-square, where I knew this villain was,
</p>
<p>although I shall, probably, by his means, be sent
</p>
<p>into another world very shortly. I went to the
</p>
<p>villain, and told him what had happened ; at
</p>
<p>which he seemed very much surprised, and left
</p>
<p>the square with me.
</p>
<p>" Shortly after up came Thistlewood and another
</p>
<p>person, who was in the room in Cato-street ; but
</p>
<p>who has not since been taken, nor never will I
</p>
<p>dare say, my Lord. However, we proceeded
</p>
<p>from Grosvenor-square, and he took us into
</p>
<p>several wine-vaults to drink ; I now believe,
</p>
<p>merely for some person to identify us. I then
</p>
<p>went to Fox-court, Holborn, where I had not been
</p>
<p>many minutes, when, as my apprentice stated,
</p>
<p>another man came in, who said he had received a
</p>
<p>violent blow in the side. But my apprentice has
</p>
<p>not stated, as the fact was, that the very indivi-
</p>
<p>dual who came on the stairs and called us out, was
</p>
<p>Edwards.
</p>
<p>" We went with him ; and, on going into
</p>
<p>Holborn, there we. met a man of the name of
</p>
<p>Palin, and three more individuals with him. We
</p>
<p>went altogether into Mr. Thompson's wine-vaults,
</p>
<p>opposite St. Andrew's Church, on Holborn-hilL
</p>
<p>We drank some small glasses of liquor. When
</p>
<p>we came out of the shop, we were followed
</p>
<p>very shortly by Edwards, who called me on one

</p>
<p>side, and said he wished to speak to me. 1 heard
</p>
<p>what he had to say. He began to find fault with
</p>
<p>Palin, who was drunk. He declared that he was
</p>
<p>the man that had betrayed us, and that he was
</p>
<p>unworthy to live. He said, that, to prevent
</p>
<p>treachery, he ought to be made away with.
</p>
<p>TKIAL OF BRl'XT. 303
</p>
<p>" From that we walked on till we came to
</p>
<p>Little Britain^ or somewhere thereabouts. We
</p>
<p>came to a dark place, where Edwards said that
</p>
<p>Cook lived ; but I did not know myself. He
</p>
<p>urged me again respecting Palin, who still re-
</p>
<p>mained much intoxicated. He said to me, that it
</p>
<p>would be the safest way to put him out of the
</p>
<p>world. He urged me several times to assassinate
</p>
<p>Palin. He then put his hand in his pocket, and
</p>
<p>pulled out a brass-barrelled loaded pistol, with
</p>
<p>which he told me to assassinate Palin. He like-
</p>
<p>wise offered me as word-stick ; and he said, ' If
</p>
<p>you put him out of the world, we shall be safe.'
</p>
<p>He also shewed me a constable's staff; and said,
</p>
<p>' I will act in the same capacity as I did in
</p>
<p>Grosvenor-square ; and, if there is any alarm, I
</p>
<p>will officiate as an officer, and you may depend
</p>
<p>on it no discovery will take place.'
</p>
<p>** Finding he entreated me to be guilty of
</p>
<p>murder, I made this reply: ' If you consider
</p>
<p>Palin a villain, the weapons are in good hands.'
</p>
<p>Finding he could not entreat me to commit
</p>
<p>murder, he says, ' I must wish you a good night ; I
</p>
<p>am going to conduct Thistlewood to some secret
</p>
<p>place.' As he had always appeared to be a par-
</p>
<p>ticular friend of Air. Thistlewood's, I thought he
</p>
<p>was the most proper person to do this.
</p>
<p>" Knowing of no evil intention myself against
</p>
<p>any individual, I was determined not to know
</p>
<p>where he went ; and I consented to bid him good
</p>
<p>night. I then went home. Edwards afterwards
</p>
<p>came to me, and whispered to me, and told me
</p>
<p>that he thought Palin and Potter had betrayed us,
</p>
<p>and that he had not the smallest doubt of it. He

</p>
<p>then advised me to send the articles which were
</p>
<p>found in the basket in the back-room, and which
</p>
<p>my apprentice has described, over to a place in
</p>
<p>the Borough, which I was going to do, but after-
</p>
<p>wards abandoned that intention.
</p>
<p>" This is all I wish to say respecting what I
</p>
<p>304 CATO-STREET COXSVIRACV.
</p>
<p>know of the plot. Now Edwards was the man
</p>
<p>who always found money, and who went abont to
</p>
<p>old-iron shops, buying- pistols and swords, and
</p>
<p>other things for the men who could not afford
</p>
<p>to buy them themselves.
</p>
<p>** This, I declare before God, whose awful tri-
</p>
<p>bunal I shall, in all probability, ere long, be sum-
</p>
<p>moned to attend, is the truth. Should I die by
</p>
<p>this case, I have been seduced by a villain, who, I
</p>
<p>have no doubt, has been employed by Govern-
</p>
<p>ment. I could not have abused confidence re-
</p>
<p>posed in me ; and, if I die, I shall die not
</p>
<p>unworthy the descendant of an ancient l^riton I
</p>
<p>Sooner than I would betray a fellow-man, I would
</p>
<p>rather suffer a thousand deaths ! This is all that
</p>
<p>I wish to say."
</p>
<p>The prisoner delivered the last part of his
</p>
<p>speech with great energy, striking his clenched
</p>
<p>fist on the board before him. lie then took his
</p>
<p>seat with perfect composure, holding in his hand
</p>
<p>the defence which he had made no use of.
</p>
<p>The Chief Baron began to sum up the evi-
</p>
<p>dence ; but, while his Lordshi[) was proceed-
</p>
<p>ing, Brunt said, " My Lord, there are some of
</p>
<p>the witnesses for the prosecution in Court ; and,
</p>
<p>as their hearing the evidence summed up may
</p>
<p>prejudice the trial of some of my fellow-prisoners,
</p>
<p>I hope your Lordship will order them to with-
</p>

<p>; Mr. Baron Garrow repeated the same obser-
</p>
<p>vation to the prisoner, who bowed respectfully to
</p>
<p>the Court, and resumed his seat.
</p>
<p>The Chief ]3aron began his charge to the
</p>
<p>Jury by telling them, that this was not con-
</p>
<p>structive treason. A nefarious assassinnfion was
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF BRUNT. 305
</p>
<p>admitted by the Counsel for the prisoner, and by
</p>
<p>the prisoner himself, to have been intended ; an
</p>
<p>assassination of some of the most honourable and
</p>
<p>the most amiable of the King's subjects.
</p>
<p>His Lordship then read the evidence.
</p>
<p>In recapitulating the evidence of Adams, his Lord-
</p>
<p>ship observed, upon that part where he (Adams)
</p>
<p>mentioned " that he had been induced to give up
</p>
<p>Christianity by reading that infernal work, Paine's
</p>
<p>Age of Reason, and the writings of Carlile," that
</p>
<p>the circumstance was important for the considera-
</p>
<p>tion of the Jury. They would weigh every part
</p>
<p>of his testimony with jealousy,^ considering the
</p>
<p>situation in which he was placed, and look upon
</p>
<p>his statement as requiring corroborative proof.
</p>
<p>Unless it was supported by such evidence, they
</p>
<p>would, of course, receive it with considerable hesi-
</p>
<p>tation ; but if they found it corroborated by the evi
</p>
<p>dence of unsuspected witnesses, they would consi
</p>
<p>der of it accordingly. His Lordship then went
</p>
<p>through the evidence of theotherwitnesses, remark-
</p>
<p>ing upon those parts where they coincided with the
</p>
<p>account given by Adams. He then adverted to
</p>
<p>the arguments of the prisoner's Counsel, and to
</p>
<p>the observations of the prisoner himself; which
</p>
<p>latter (though, perhaps, it might not have pro-
</p>
<p>duced the impression which they could have
</p>
<p>wished, for the sake of the prisoner) they would
</p>
<p>give every attention to.
</p>
<p>As soon as his Lordship concluded, and before
</p>
<p>the Jury retired, one of them addressed the Court :
</p>
<p>" My Lord, I hope your Lordship will allow me to
</p>
<p>ask a question as to a point of law.

<p>thing you please.
</p>
<p>Juror.  iVIy ^Lord, we are bound to take the
</p>
<p>law from your Lordship, and no doubt you will
</p>
<p>give it to us most correctly. I wish to know whe-
</p>
<p>ther, if the evidence bore out that an arming had
</p>
<p>taken place, and that there was a resistance to
</p>

</p>
<p>30G CATO-STREET CONSTIRACY.
</p>
<p>the civil power, would that, in the law, be ii
</p>
<p>levying of war ?
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Baron.  Undoubtedly. After a
</p>
<p>short pause, his Lordship said, '* Gentlemen, do
</p>
<p>I understand the question rightly ? Please to
</p>
<p>repeat it again."
</p>
<p>The Juror repeated the question ; and his
</p>
<p>Lordship replied, that a resistance to the civil
</p>
<p>authority would not constitute a levying of war.
</p>
<p>The Juror.  My Lord, if there was an arming
</p>
<p>for the purpose of inducing his Majesty to change
</p>
<p>his measures, would that be a levying of war ?
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Baron.  That, gentlemen, would
</p>
<p>constitute a levying of war ; and, if you believe
</p>
<p>that it was j^roved in evidence, it would support
</p>
<p>the indictment under the Act of his late Majesty.
</p>
<p>I put only the first and third counts to you, geri-
</p>
<p>tlemen, not to embarrass the case.
</p>
<p>71ie same Juror.  I would wish to consider the
</p>
<p>whole of the indictment. I hope your Lordship
</p>
<p>will excuse my asking these questions.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief Baron.  Certainly, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>it is your province to consider the whole of the
</p>
<p>case before you. You have also an undoubted
</p>
<p>right to ask any questions you may think neces-
</p>
<p>sary.
</p>
<p>The Jury then retired at tw^enty minutes before
</p>
<p>four ; and in about ten minutes returned with a
</p>
<p>verdict of GUILTY on the THIRD and FOURTH
</p>
<p>COUNTS.
</p>
<p>The prisoner's appearance was in no degree
</p>
<p>altered by the annunciation of the verdict. He
</p>
<p>bowed slightly to the Court, and was removed in

<p>Fird Daj/, Wcdncsdai/, April <1G, 1 820.
</p>
<p>At ten minutes after nine o'clock, INIr. Baron
</p>
<p>Oarrow, Mr. Justice Best, and the Common-
</p>
<p>Serjeant, took their seats on the bench; the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General, Mr. Gurney, and Mr. Bolland,
</p>
<p>and the prisoner's counsel, Messrs. Adolphus and
</p>
<p>Curwood, appeared in Court at the same time.
</p>
<p>After a short consultation between Mr. Cur-
</p>
<p>wood and the Attorney-General, Mr. Harmer
</p>
<p>quitted the Court, and proceeded to commune
</p>
<p>with the prisoners in the gaol.
</p>
<p>During the absence of Mr. Harmer, Mr. Baron
</p>
<p>Garrow addressed the gentlemen who were
</p>
<p>waiting to be called on as Jurors. '' They
</p>
<p>mio-ht," he said, " feel some surprise at the delay,
</p>
<p>and the Bench, therefore, felt it right to declare
</p>
<p>that the present interruption was caused entirely
</p>
<p>by an application made b}^ the prisoners' counsel.
</p>
<p>He hoped that the Jury would not consider the
</p>
<p>delay as intended to convey any want of respect
</p>
<p>towards them.
</p>
<p>One of the Jurors said, he hoped the Court
</p>
<p>would allow them to sit down, as many of them
</p>
<p>iiad come a considerable distance to attend the
</p>
<p>Court.
</p>
<p>]Mr. Baron Garrow said, that the Court felt
</p>
<p>every disposition to accommodate, in every pos-
</p>
<p>sible manner, the uciitlemcn of the Jury, and

</p>
<p>requested them to occupy the seacs vacant in the
</p>
<p>Court.
</p>
<p>Soon afterwards Mr. Harmer returned to Court,
</p>
<p>and communicated to Mr. Curwood the result of
</p>
<p>his conference.
</p>
<p>Mr. Curwood then, addressing Mr. Baron
</p>
<p>Garrow, stated, that a proposition, which he had
</p>
<p>thought for the benefit of his chents, had been
</p>
<p>acceded to by them, and that two of them (Tidd
</p>
<p>and Davidson) were willing to take their trials at
</p>
<p>the same time.
</p>
<p>Mr. Baron Garrow then addressed the Jury-
</p>
<p>men, and said, " Gentlemen, I may now com-
</p>
<p>municate to you that which it would have been
</p>
<p>improper to have made known to you before.
</p>
<p>Tlie learned gentleman who appears here for the
</p>
<p>prisoners, and whose exertions you have
</p>
<p>witnessed upon more occasions than one, has
</p>
<p>thought fit to consult his clients as to whether it
</p>
<p>is necessary to pursue the course which has
</p>
<p>already been adopted in severing their challenges,
</p>
<p>or whether two of them might not take their trial
</p>
<p>by the same Jury. By this pause we have in
</p>
<p>effect saved time, for the two next prisoners have
</p>
<p>agreed not to sever their challenges, but to be
</p>
<p>tried at the same time."
</p>
<p>The prisoners, Tidd and Davidson, were then
</p>
<p>put to the bar ; Mr. Shelton called over the list
</p>
<p>of the Jurors, and after a number of challenges
</p>
<p>on both sides, the following Jury was ultimately

<p>The Jurors thus marked * had served on some of the previous

</p>
<p>Davidson asked whetlier the Court would
</p>
<p>allow him and his fellow-prisoner to sit down.
</p>
<p>The Court complied with his request, and chairs
</p>
<p>were brought to them.
</p>
<p>Mr. Gurney having stated the case with great
</p>
<p>clearness and ingenuity, he proceeded to call the
</p>
<p>witnesses for the Crown  beginning with,
</p>
<p>Robert Adams. His evidence was the same
</p>
<p>as before, with some additions. He said, that
</p>
<p>when the proposition was made for assassinating
</p>
<p>the Ministers, it was added, that they had found
</p>
<p>out where they kept their specie, and that they
</p>
<p>were to return and plunder it. Bradburn was
</p>
<p>to make a box for the purpose of sending Castle-
</p>
<p>rcagh's head to Ireland.
</p>
<p>In cross-examination by Mr. Curwood, he said he
</p>
<p>came back to the belief in Christianity about the 24th
</p>
<p>of February  the day after he was in marvellous
</p>
<p>great danger of being hanged. The halter might
</p>
<p>have had some effect. It was never lawful in his
</p>
<p>sight to sweep off fifteen men in cold blood. He
</p>
<p>thought it was a cruel act when it was proposed.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, from the 12th of January to the

<p>23d of F'ebruary, he still continued to frequent
</p>
<p>the society in which that matter was debated.
</p>
<p>He was once a chairman. The largest body he
</p>
<p>ever saw collected was in Cato-street. There
</p>
<p>was a talk of a great many more, but he did not
</p>
<p>know them by name. His single sword was all
</p>
<p>he agreed to contribute. He never heard where
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>10 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY,
</p>
<p>Mr. Cook's party were to come from. Nobody
</p>
<p>objected to the proclamation written by This-
</p>
<p>tlewood  ** Your tyrants are destroyed," ^c.
</p>
<p>He did not know a man of the name of Cham-
</p>
<p>bers, nor did he ever call upon such a man, and
</p>
<p>say he would have ** wine and blood for supper,"
</p>
<p>and solicit him to join in this plot. His object
</p>
<p>in joining their parties was, to search further into
</p>
<p>the principles of Brunt ; he joined them because
</p>
<p>he had a foolish and curious idea to know what
</p>
<p>Brunt's principles were ; and for this reason he
</p>
<p>joined in this plot. He did not know a man of
</p>
<p>the name of Watman, Tidd did not say he had
</p>
<p>been deceived in the loft in Cato-street ; but he
</p>
<p>said, *' it never can be done."
</p>
<p>Tidd and Davidson now both expressed a wisli
</p>
<p>to ask the witness some questions;
</p>
<p>Mr. Baron Garrow humanely interposed, and
</p>
<p>suggested whether, for their own advantage, it
</p>
<p>would not be more consistent with prudence to
</p>
<p>put their questions through their Counsel, as
</p>
<p>they might do something prejudicial to them-
</p>
<p>selves.
</p>
<p>The prisoners both thanked his Lordship, and
</p>
<p>communicated to Mr. Harmer's clerk, the in-
</p>
<p>quiries which they wished to be made.
</p>
<p>The witness then, in answer to questions put
</p>
<p>by Mr. Curwood, said, that he could not say that
</p>
<p>Davidson was armed in Cato-street ; he did not
</p>
<p>notice any arms.
</p>
<p>In re-examination by the Solicitor- General, he
</p>
<p>said that Davidson brought 500 bullets to Fox-
</p>
<p>court, on the 22d of February. He had changed

<p>his religion in consequence of reading Paine's
</p>
<p>Age of Reason, which was put into his hand by the
</p>
<p>jnisoner Tidd; he did not see Palin, or Cook, or
</p>
<p>l\)tter, in Cato-street ; he did not know of whnt
</p>
<p>numbers their parties consisted.
</p>
<p>i^LKAxou Walker, Mary Rogers, .Tom ph
</p>
<p>Hale, (ap))rcntice to Brunt), were then culled ;

<p>TIllAl. OV TIDD AND DAVIDSOX. 311
</p>
<p>they repeated their former testimony as to the
</p>
<p>presence oi" Davidson and Tidd at the meetings in
</p>
<p>Fox-eourt.
</p>
<p>Hale, in cross-examination by Mr. Curwood,
</p>
<p>said, that Edwards was oftener at the meetings in
</p>
<p>Fox-eourt than Adams.
</p>
<p>Thomas Smart and Charles Bissex, watch-
</p>
<p>men in Grosvenor-square, were next called. They
</p>
<p>were followed by Hector Morrison, servant to
</p>
<p>Mr. Underwood, the cutler ; Henry Gillan, of
</p>
<p>Mount-street, Grosvenor-square ; Edward Si>mp-
</p>
<p>son, James Aldous (pawnbroker), John Monu-
</p>
<p>ment, and Thomas Hyden, who communicated the
</p>
<p>plot to Lord Harrowby. The last witness, in
</p>
<p>cross-examination, said, that he had known Wilson
</p>
<p>for a long time. He agreed to join in the plot to
</p>
<p>^avc himself. One evening at his friend Clark's
</p>
<p>he was accused of not supporting the committee,
</p>
<p>and Davidson said, " those that did not come for-
</p>
<p>ward woukl be the men that they would first mur-
</p>
<p>der." This made him agree to what Wilson said.
</p>
<p>He knew a man named Bennet, but he never
</p>
<p>did ask him to attend ' a private radical meeting.'
</p>
<p>He believed, he said, he miglit speak or not sneak
</p>
<p>when he was there, as he chose. He did not say
</p>
<p>^" Radical meeting,"' nor did he say that he must
</p>
<p>take up arms, if he were called upon so to do ; he
</p>
<p>did not recollect saying so ; he had no recollection
</p>
<p>that he ever did say so.
</p>
<p>In re-examination, witness said he had been
</p>
<p>twice at a shoemakers'-club, where he saw David
</p>
<p>son, Wilson, and Harrison. This club was held
</p>
<p>at a public-house, called the Scotch Arms, in a
</p>
<p>court in the Strand. He asked Bennet to go

</p>
<p>or six months ago.
</p>
<p>Thomas Monument, Loru Harrombv, and

</p>
<p>examined, in confirmation ol" the former wit-

</p>
<p>and other persons who were present at the occur-
</p>
<p>rences in Cato-street, and the subsequent arrest of
</p>
<p>Brunt and Thistlewood.
</p>
<p>Tidd, in reference to Ruthven's evidence, said,
</p>
<p>that Ruthven, on searching him, had said, ** Curse
</p>
<p>me, here's nothing here but a tobacco-box."
</p>
<p>Ruthven, on being asked by Mr. Baron Garrow,
</p>
<p>denied that he had made use of any such expres-
</p>
<p>sion.
</p>
<p>The Attorney-General now addressed their
</p>
<p>Lordships, and stated, " that the case for the
</p>
<p>Crown had now been concluded, with the ex-
</p>
<p>ception of producing the arms and ammunition
</p>
<p>found in Cato-street and elsewhere. As it was
</p>
<p>now late, (five o'clock) the Court would perhaps
</p>
<p>defer the production of these things till the next
</p>
<p>morning.*'
</p>
<p>Mr. Baron Garrow :  *' Gentlemen of the Jury,
</p>
<p>the case for the prosecution is now closed, all but
</p>
<p>the production of the arms. If by sitting late
</p>
<p>there were any probability of bringing the trial to
</p>
<p>a close this night, I should consult you as to the
</p>
<p>propriety of doing so ; but as we cannot finish it
</p>
<p>by sitting late, and thereby exhausting ourselves,
</p>
<p>this is the best time for adjourning.
</p>
<p>Davidson stood up and addressed the Court : 
</p>
<p>** My Lord, as I have been taken by surprise, I
</p>
<p>am quite unprepared with my witnesses. I hope
</p>
<p>you will allow niy wife to see me this night, that
</p>
<p>notice may be given them to attend.''
</p>
<p>Mr. Baron Garrow :  *' The Court has no power
</p>
<p>to make any order on the subject you have men-
</p>
<p>tioned ; but I can say that care will be taken that
</p>
<p>any proper person may be admitted to you for any

<p>proper purpose."
</p>
<p>The Court then adjourned till nine the next
</p>
<p>morning.
</p>
<p>Davidson took notes during the day, and fre-
</p>
<p>quently sent communications to his counsel. He
</p>
<p>conducted himself altogether with great compo-

<p>sure dnd propriety. He ])aid close attention, and
</p>
<p>made his remarks, both verbally and in writing,
</p>
<p>without effort or conliision.
</p>
<p>Tidd seemed to have perfect self-possession,
</p>
<p>but a flush that occasionally animated his face in-
</p>
<p>dicated some hurry and eagerness of mind.
</p>
<p>Second Day.  Thursday, April 27, 1820.
</p>
<p>This morning the Conrt assembled in pursu-
</p>
<p>ance of adjournment, at nine o'clock. The pri-
</p>
<p>soners, Tidd and Davidson were immediately put
</p>
<p>to the bar. They were provided with chairs as on
</p>
<p>the preceding day, Davidson had a bible in his
</p>
<p>hand, which appeared to have been much read,
</p>
<p>and in the leaves of which were several marks.
</p>
<p>He had also a large book composed of sheets of
</p>
<p>paper sewn together, in which there appeared to
</p>
<p>be a good deal of writing, and in which he occa-
</p>
<p>sionally wrote while in court.
</p>
<p>The armS; ammunition, and other Tnaterials of
</p>
<p>war, found in Cato- street, and in other places,
</p>
<p>connected with the machinations of the prisoners,
</p>
<p>were brought into court previous to the arrival of
</p>
<p>the judges.
</p>
<p>The Court having been opened in the customary
</p>
<p>form, RuTHVEN, the Bow-street officer, was
</p>
<p>called, and described the arms and other articles
</p>
<p>taken in Cato-street, and on the persons ot the pri-
</p>
<p>soners. These were again separately exhibited
</p>
<p>to the Jury.
</p>
<p>Samuel Taunton selected the ball cartridges,
</p>
<p>hand grenades, ])ike handles, and arm^-, found in

<p>taken from Tidd, after he had attempted to dis-
</p>
<p>charge it at Lieutenant Fitzclarence, were next
</p>
<p>produced, and underwent a minute inspection.
</p>
<p>Sergeant Hanson was next called; he re-
</p>
<p>peated his description of the fire-balls, and
</p>
<p>the probable effects which would result from
</p>
<p>their being thrown upon buildings. He also ex-
</p>
<p>plained the nature of the powder in flannel bags,
</p>
<p>which, as before, he stated were cartridges for
</p>
<p>six pounders. He then opened one of the hand-
</p>
<p>grenades, and exhibited its component parts to
</p>
<p>the Jury. This one was only armed with ibur
</p>
<p>large spike nails, but some of the others which
</p>
<p>were opened had no less than twenty-live separate
</p>
<p>pieces of old iron enfolded within the outer wrap-
</p>
<p>pings of rope-yarn. The large grenade, weighing
</p>
<p>nearly fourteen pounds, and constructed in the
</p>
<p>same way, but upon a larger scale, was not in-
</p>
<p>spected.
</p>
<p>Mr. Gurney announced that he had closed the
</p>
<p>evidence on the part of the Crovv^n,

<p>THE DEFENCE.
</p>
<p>Mr. CuRwooD rose to address the Jury on the
</p>
<p>part of the prisoners. He said, " that he had now
</p>
<p>rose for the fourth time, to urge those topics on
</p>
<p>behalf of the unfortunate men at the bar, which he
</p>
<p>had previously submitted to other Juries in the
</p>
<p>course of these trials. The force of those topics
</p>
<p>remained in his mind undiminished ; he was still
</p>
<p>conscientiously satisfied, that the charge of high
</p>
<p>treason in these cases was alone supported by
</p>
<p>the testimony of Adams,  a man, the infamy of
</p>
<p>whose character ought in his estimation, to de-
</p>
<p>prive him of all claims to credit.

<p>The learned gentleman then went over the dif-
</p>
<p>ferent points of the evidence, and contended with

<p>great ingenuity, ** that whatever might have been

<p>ever ready they miglit have been to inflict ven-
</p>
<p>geance on those whom they might suppose to be
</p>
<p>the authors of those mclanciioly transactions, but
</p>
<p>too frequently designated as ' the IManchester
</p>
<p>Massacre,'  yet, that in all these things there
</p>
<p>was nothing in reason or common sense, that
</p>
<p>could lead to a fair and rational conclusion that
</p>
<p>they had it in contemplation either to compass
</p>
<p>and imagine the death of the king, or to levy war
</p>
<p>against the king.
</p>
<p>" If the Jury, under all the circumstances, enter-
</p>
<p>tained with him this opinion, he had no doubt
</p>
<p>they would not hesitate to acquit the prisoners,"
</p>
<p>During the time Mr. Curwood was addressing
</p>
<p>the Jury, Davidson took from his pocket a Bible,
</p>
<p>into several parts of which he inserted small
</p>
<p>pieces of paper, for the purpose of enabling him to
</p>
<p>turn more readily to certain passages which he
</p>
<p>intended to quote in his defence.
</p>
<p>Mr. Ado LP II us now called the witnesses for
</p>
<p>the defence.
</p>
<p>Mary Barker, the daughter of Tidd, deposed,
</p>
<p>that she knew Edwards and Adams. Edwards
</p>
<p>left at her father's house, about a fortnight before
</p>
<p>the affair in CatO'Street, a number of grenades and
</p>
<p>some powder. Adams also left a very large gre-
</p>
<p>nade. They were to be called for again. Ed-
</p>
<p>wards took them once aw^ay, and brought thcni
</p>
<p>back afterwards. They were taken away again
</p>
<p>on the 23d of February by Edwards ; and some
</p>
<p>were brought back on the morning of the 24 th,
</p>
<p>about a quarter of an hour before the officers came.
</p>
<p>She did not know the person by whom they were
</p>
<p>brought back. A box remained which had never

<p>been opened.
</p>
<p>As the witness left the Court she squeezed her
</p>
<p>father's hand. They both seemed much afiecled.
</p>
<p>Tears came into the eves of Tidd, which he

</p>
<p>endeavoured to suppress. The daughter was in
</p>
<p>an agony of grief.
</p>
<p>Thomas Chambers deposed, that he lived in
</p>
<p>Heathcote-court, Strand; Edwards and Adams
</p>
<p>repeatedly called upon him. They came together
</p>
<p>to his house about a week before the Cato-street
</p>
<p>business, when Edwards said, " Won't you go
</p>
<p>along with us? Witness said, " Go where?"
</p>
<p>when Edwards answered, " Oh, you must know
</p>
<p>that there is something on foot." He replied,
</p>
<p>he did not; when Adams said, "We are going
</p>
<p>to kill his Majesty's Ministers, and we shall
</p>
<p>have blood and wine fop supper." Edwards said,
</p>
<p>" By , Adams, you're right.'' On the Mon-
</p>
<p>day before the Cato-street business they came
</p>
<p>again. Edwards brought with him a bag, which
</p>
<p>he wished to leave with witness. He asked what
</p>
<p>it contained ; when Edwards said, *' Only some
</p>
<p>pistols, and things of that sort." Witness would
</p>
<p>not receive it, and they went away. He saw no
</p>
<p>more of them.
</p>
<p>In cross-examination, witness said, " I believe
</p>
<p>1 have been sworn on the prayer-book. I never
</p>
<p>was sworn before above twice ; I believe in Chris-
</p>

</p>
<p>tion. I never saw Paine's works. I know the
</p>
<p>two prisoners. Davidson I know since the time

<p>of Mr. Hunt's procession. Tidd I have known
</p>
<p>only in the trade. I cannot say how long ; I
</p>
<p>might have known him at the Smithfield Meeting,
</p>
<p>and elsewhere. I attended all the meetings held

<p>in the open air. I scorn all secret meetings. I

</p>
<p>processions. I carried no weapons. Thistle-

</p>
<p>the White Lion, in Wych-street ; I went to attend
</p>
<p>the meetings there. They called themselves Re-
</p>
<p>formers. I was always in the waggons with
</p>
<p>Hunt. When I refused to go with Adams and
</p>
<p>Edwards to kill his Majesty's Ministers, I did not
</p>
<p>think they would evr get any persons to be so
</p>
<p>foolish as to join them. I may be a great fool,
</p>
<p>but not foolish enough to enter into such a
</p>
<p>scheme. I did not communicate the project to
</p>
<p>any magistrate. I never heard any thing said
</p>
<p>against his Majesty's Ministers, more than what
</p>
<p>I saw in the newspapers. I do not [read Paine's
</p>
<p>works ; I only read Cobbett, and have a drawer
</p>
<p>full of them. I also read the Prayer-book and
</p>
<p>Bible."
</p>
<p>John Bexnett deposed, that heknewHyden;
</p>
<p>he called on him to ask him to accompany him to
</p>
<p>a private radical meeting. He endeavoured to
</p>
<p>persuade him to go more than ten times. He told
</p>
<p>him, that he might hear and see what was doing ;
</p>
<p>but he need not speak unless he liked.
</p>
<p>Several witnesses were now called to the gene-
</p>
<p>ral character of the prisoners.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cook, of Charlotte-street, Blackfriars'-
</p>
<p>road, knew Davidson six years ago ; he then
</p>
<p>worked for him, and was an industrious hard-
</p>
<p>working man. He had not known much of him
</p>
<p>since.
</p>
<p>Mr. M'WiLLiAM, an architect, knew Davidson
</p>
<p>at Aberdeen, in the years 1800 and 1801 ; he was
</p>
<p>then studying mathematics ; he had only seen
</p>
<p>him three or four times since in the streets, and
</p>
<p>was surprised to have been called on to give him
</p>
<p>a character. Davidson was, at the time he was

</p>
<p>at Aberdeen, an apprentice to a cabinet-maker.
</p>
<p>He had been at college, and had, in I\Ir. M'Wil-
</p>
<p>liani's estimation, " a gigantic mind."'
</p>
<p>Stethen Hale, WilliaiM French, and Sa-
</p>
<p>muel Lands, spoke to the general correctness of
</p>
<p>the conduct of Tidd in private life. He was an
</p>
<p>318 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>honest, industrious, hard-working man, and ap-
</p>
<p>parently much attached to his family. Other
</p>
<p>witnesses were expected, but did not attend.
</p>
<p>Mr. Adolphus addressed the Jury on behalf
</p>
<p>of the prisoners. His speech was marked by an
</p>
<p>acute examination of the whole of the evidence,
</p>
<p>a just and forcible reprobation of the atrocity of
</p>
<p>a betraying accomplice, and an energetic and
</p>
<p>powerful appeal to the Jury, not to condemn men
</p>
<p>on the evidence of an avowed conspirator, who
</p>
<p>had broken the bonds of society, forfeited his
</p>
<p>allegiance to his Sovereign, and his duty to God.
</p>
<p>The learned gentleman, in the course of a very
</p>
<p>eloquent speech of an hour and a half, remarked
</p>
<p>that it would be the last time he should appear
</p>
<p>on these trials.
</p>
<p>Baron Garrow then addressed the prisoner as
</p>
<p>follows :  '* William Davidson, the law of Eng-
</p>
<p>land, in its excessive tenderness to persons in-
</p>
<p>dicted for high treason, has allowed them privi-
</p>
<p>leges of defence not extended to other cases. If,
</p>
<p>therefore, in addition to the able defence of your
</p>
<p>Counsel, you wish to say any thing, now is the
</p>
<p>time. Do it deliberately, and the Court will hear
</p>
<p>you attentively."
</p>
<p>Davidson then rose, greatly agitated, and spoke
</p>
<p>nearly as follows :  " I am much obliged to your
</p>
<p>Lordship, and will call your attention to a few
</p>
<p>particulars in this instance. My Lord, from my
</p>
<p>life up, I have always maintained the character
</p>
<p>of an industrious and inoffensive man I have no
</p>
<p>friends in England, but have always depended
</p>
<p>upon my own exertions for support. I have an
</p>
<p>extensive family, and for their sake alone is my

</p>
<p>life a value to me.
</p>
<p>*' The charge which has been brought against
</p>
<p>me> I can lay my hand upon my heart, and, in
</p>
<p>the presence of that God whom I revere, say 1
</p>
<p>am not guilty of. Concerning how I came in
</p>
<p>TRIAL OF TIDD AXD DAVIDSOX, 31D
</p>
<p>possession of the blunderbuss I will state. I had
</p>
<p>a friend, whose name is Williamson, who told me
</p>
<p>he had bought an old blunderbuss, which was all
</p>
<p>over rust. He was going to the Cape of Good
</p>
<p>Hope, and gave it to me to clean.
</p>
<p>" I have been doing business for myself for the
</p>
<p>last five years, and that is the reason I cannot
</p>
<p>bring any more of my employers than Mr, Cook
</p>
<p>to speak in my behalf. To IMr. Edwards I owe
</p>
<p>being brought into this situation. I never knew
</p>
<p>any thing of him till I attended Mr. Hunt's pro-
</p>
<p>cession ; that was the first time I ever went into
</p>
<p>public in my life. Mr. Edwards told me that
</p>
<p>he would take me to a place to have this
</p>
<p>blunderbuss raffled for. When I went to the
</p>
<p>place, I there saw Mr. Thistlewood for the second
</p>
<p>time ; I had previously seen him at Mr. Hunt's
</p>
<p>dinner. I saw Mr. Adams there also, but I knew
</p>
<p>none of the others. Mr. Edwards proposed to
</p>
<p>commence raffling for the blunderbuss; but, as
</p>
<p>they did not put down any money, I would not
</p>
<p>agree. 1 then heard a great deal of improper
</p>
<p>language, and would not stop.
</p>
<p>" I went to Mr. Williamson, who was waiting
</p>
<p>to know the result, and told him what had
</p>
<p>passed. He then said that he wanted to get some
</p>
<p>money, and I proposed pledging the blunderbuss
</p>
<p>with a pawnbroker. He agreed, and requested
</p>
<p>me to take it for him. I did so, and got seven
</p>
<p>shillings upon it from Mr. Aldous, who knew me.
</p>
<p>The money I gave to Mr, Williamson. I after-
</p>
<p>wards went to see Mr. Williamson on board the
</p>
<p>Belle Alliance, which was about to sail for the
</p>
<p>Cape. He made me a present of the ticket.

</p>
<p>" On the ?/2d of February, Edwards called
</p>
<p>upon me, and told [me that he had been to see
</p>
<p>Mr. Williamson, and that he had given him an
</p>
<p>order to get the ticket for the blunderbusss. I
</p>
<p>said very well, and consented to go and get it
</p>
<p>out of pledge for him, as, he said, he was to get
</p>
<p>320 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>ten shillings by it, part of which I was to have,
</p>
<p>and he gave seven shillings and two-pence for
</p>
<p>that purpose. He told me to meet him at the
</p>
<p>corner of Oxford-street, which I did ; when he
</p>
<p>said he would take me to Fox-court, where there
</p>
<p>was a countryman of mine ; a man of colour he
</p>
<p>meant. I objected to going.
</p>
<p>*' My Lord, I never associated with men of
</p>
<p>colour, although one myself, because I always
</p>
<p>found them very ignorant.
</p>
<p>*' I now pass over to the sword concern ; I
</p>
<p>shall state the truth. On a Monday after the
</p>
<p>Manchester massacre, I met a person of the
</p>
<p>name of George Gold worthy, to whom I had
</p>
<p>been apprentice in Liverpool ; he expressed his
</p>
<p>surprise at seeing me in London ; I told him I
</p>
<p>was out of employment, and that there was
</p>
<p>nothing worse than being a small master, as all
</p>
<p>the rest of the trade, from jealousy, set their face
</p>
<p>against me ; he said he had a little business of his
</p>
<p>own in the country, and that he would employ
</p>
<p>me if I would go. I agreed to go at 30*. a week.
</p>
<p>He then appointed me to meet him at a house he
</p>
<p>called the Horse and Groom, in John-street,
</p>
<p>Edgware-road, on the Wednesday following. All
</p>
<p>this time I did not know that Goldworthy was an
</p>
<p>acquaintance of Edwards's, but he was.
</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening accordingly I went to
</p>
<p>the Horse and Groom. I looked into the house,
</p>
<p>but did not see Goldworthy. I stopped at the
</p>
<p>corner to wait for him, my lord, which your
</p>
<p>lordship and gentlemen must well know I being
</p>
<p>a conspicuous character would not have done, if I
</p>
<p>was about any thing improper. I saw Adams

</p>
<p>there ; but I went on to walk a littl'e further:
</p>
<p>On my return I saw several persons going in and
</p>
<p>out of the house, but still Goldworthy did not
</p>
<p>come. A little after eight o'clock, while I was
</p>
<p>in the Edgeware-road, up came Goldworthy.
</p>
<p>He asked me if 1 was not surprised he had not
</p>
<p>TRIAL or TIDU AND DAVIDSOX. 321
</p>
<p>come. I said I was. lie then said he was goii;g
</p>
<p>to call upon a friend, and gave me a sword,
</p>
<p>which he said he carried for self-protection against
</p>
<p>thieves about the country.
</p>
<p>" At this time I had not the least intention of
</p>
<p>any thing directly or indirectly concerning the
</p>
<p>business in Cato-street. I went down the street
</p>
<p>accidentally, and hearing two or three pistols
</p>
<p>fired, 1 went to see what was the matter. I
</p>
<p>never was afraid of any man. I .then heard a
</p>
<p>cry of * Stop thief!" and I was seized and
</p>
<p>taken to gaol. I never drew the cutlass nor
</p>
<p>oifered to strike ; but gave myself up quietly.
</p>
<p>** I have ventured my life fifteen times for my
</p>
<p>country and my King, and ask you, gentlemen,
</p>
<p>if you think it possible that 1 should be so vain
</p>
<p>as to attempt to join a few weak men to trample
</p>
<p>down that well-founded constitution, in which
</p>
<p>this country has so much reason to glory ? I
</p>
<p>would scorn such an act  and I solemnly protest
</p>
<p>there was nothing found on mc but the sword
</p>
<p>which I received from Goldworthy, and a little
</p>
<p>block.
</p>
<p>" It was said, that I said ' I would die for
</p>
<p>liberty's cause,' and that I was searched in a
</p>
<p>public house ; this is not true ; and if the landlord
</p>
<p>was here he would prove the contrary. I know
</p>
<p>nothing at all of the plot in Cato-street, directly
</p>
<p>or indirectly. I know nothing of a plot to plunder
</p>
<p> to burn houses  or to massacre the Ministers.
</p>
<p>I did not know that any such plot was in ex-
</p>
<p>istence.
</p>
<p>" I will now, my T^rds and Gentlemen, give
</p>
<p>you an instance where one man of colour may be

</p>
<p>mistaken for another  as must have been my
</p>
<p>case. Whenever I had any leisure time I em-
</p>
<p>ployed it as a teacher in a Sunday-school : there
</p>
<p>a similar mistake was made. A person, a man
</p>
<p>of colour, insulted one of the female teachers at
</p>
<p>Walworth, The youni; lady said it was me, and
</p>
<p>2T
</p>
<p>322 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY".
</p>
<p>I found I was slighted, although nothing was
</p>
<p>said. I sent in my resignation, when the gentle-
</p>
<p>men waited upon me in a body, and stated what
</p>
<p>had been alleged to my charge. I was so con-
</p>
<p>founded, that I could not say any thing, and let
</p>
<p>them go away without making any defence. I
</p>
<p>afterwards, however, set myself to work, and
</p>
<p>actually found the man who had committed the
</p>
<p>offence, made him acknowledge it, and beg the
</p>
<p>young lady's pardon. The young lady could not
</p>
<p>look me in the face, knowing how she had injured
</p>
<p>me, but held out her hand as a token of her
</p>
<p>regret.
</p>
<p>Now, my lord and gentlemen, this shows how
</p>
<p>one man may be mistaken for another. I would
</p>
<p>as lieve be put to death as suppose that you, my
</p>
<p>lord, or the gentlemen of the crown, should think
</p>
<p>me capable, for one moment, of harbouring a
</p>
<p>thought to massacre any person whatever. (Here
</p>
<p>the prisoner applied for a glass of water, which
</p>
<p>was handed to him.) Although I am a man of
</p>
<p>colour, that is no reason that I should be guilty
</p>
<p>of such a crirv3. My colour may be against me,
</p>
<p>but I have as good and as fair a heart as if I were
</p>
<p>a white.
</p>
<p>" I have a very few words more to say. I have
</p>
<p>a very numerous family, and a wife that never
</p>
<p>earned me a penny in her life. All my distress
</p>
<p>arose from the consideration of the helpless situa-
</p>
<p>tion of my family. Were it not for that, I would
</p>
<p>not care what became of me. Like Isaiah it may be
</p>
<p>said of me, ' He was persecuted, yet he opened
</p>
<p>not his mouth.' As a father, I wish to discharge
</p>

<p>'" First of all, Mr. Adams positively swore that
</p>
<p>he had not seen me in tlie loft, and that I was

<p>who ^".niri that I addressed the congregation, and

<p>out. They must see that this was an exaggera-
</p>
<p>tion, and in fact altogether an invention, or would
</p>
<p>not both of these men who were present at the
</p>
<p>.same time have agreed in the same story ? I
</p>
<p>admit that 1 w^as in Cato-street; but even ad-
</p>
<p>mitting this, what does it amount to ?
</p>
<p>" I now very well know that Mr. Goldworthy
</p>
<p>was an accomplice of Edwards, and it is clear
</p>
<p>that by these persons, for purposes best known to
</p>
<p>themselves, I was entrapped into this snare. As
</p>
<p>for myself, my Lord, 1 have served my country,
</p>
<p>and done all that I could do for it. I have su])-
</p>
<p>ported my family by honest industry, and I never
</p>
<p>directly or indirectly associated with any persons
</p>
<p>at public places. I never attended any meeting-
</p>
<p>but as a common spectator.
</p>
<p>I know nothing of these men (Tidd and the
</p>
<p>other prisoners). I have no knowledge of their
</p>
<p>plots ; I do not blame the gentlemen of the crown
</p>
<p>for the manner in which they have conducted tliis
</p>
<p>case ; because they have done no more than their
</p>
<p>duty, according to the evidence which has been
</p>
<p>brought before them; but I say, the witnesses, as
</p>
<p>i'ar as regards me, are altogether ialse sworn. I
</p>
<p>have selected a few passages from the J3ible,
</p>
<p>which I wish to read on this subject, and these I
</p>
<p>orter, not for the purpose of insulting the court.
</p>
<p>The indictment charges that I did certain things
</p>
<p>' not having the fear ot God before my eyes, but
</p>
<p>having been instigated by the devil.' Now, I
</p>
<p>always had the fear of God befori} me, and always

<p>cherished the ibelings of virtue and humanity. I

<p>To hide the fault I see :

<p>The mercy I to others show,

<p>That mercy show to me."
</p>
<p>" The verses from this sacred Book, which I
</p>
<p>think applicable to my case on the present occa-
</p>
<p>sion, are these : 
</p>
<p>* One witness shall not rise up against a man for any ini-
</p>
<p>quity, for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth ; at the mouth of
</p>
<p>two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall
</p>
<p>the matter be estabUsiied. ^
</p>
<p>* If a false witness rise up against any man, to testify
</p>
<p>against him that which is wrong ;
</p>
<p>* Then both the men, between whom the controversy is,
</p>
<p>shall stand before the Lord, before the priests and the judges
</p>
<p>which shall be in those days.
</p>
<p>* And the judges shall make diligent inquisition : and be-^
</p>
<p>hold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified
</p>
<p>falsely against his brother;
</p>
<p>* Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have
</p>
<p>done unto his brother ; so shalt thou put the evil away from
</p>
<p>among you.
</p>
<p>* And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall
</p>
<p>henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.
</p>
<p>* And thine eye shall not pity ; but life shall go for life,
</p>
<p>pye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
</p>
<p>f These words, gentlemen of the Jury, I wish
</p>
<p>to impress on your minds.

<p>* Gentlemen, when I think of this, it unmans

<p>me, I am no plotter  no assassin  no traitor !

<p>Look well to the evidence, and to your own

</p>
<p>" Gentlemen, the Earl of Harrowby I hare
</p>
<p>known for years; I worked on his Lordship's
</p>
<p>estate in Staffordshire. Gentlemen, I knew him
</p>
<p>but to respect him;  and yet it is suggested that
</p>
<p>I could raise the dagger of the inurderer to his
</p>
<p>breast.  Forbid it providence ! Had I known
</p>
<p>that this plot existed, I would have been the first
</p>
<p>to warn his Lordship of his danger ; but I declare
</p>
<p>solemnly that I knew not of such an intention. I
</p>
<p>knew nothing of all these dark and bloody pro-
</p>
<p>jects.
</p>
<p>** Gentlemen, I have now done. I repeat, I
</p>
<p>will readily submit to death if you think me ca-
</p>
<p>pable of harbouring an intention to commit the
</p>
<p>crime of high treason. If that is your persuasion,
</p>
<p>pronounce your verdict accordingly. I hope my
</p>
<p>death may prove useful to my country,  for still

<p>England I call thee so,  ^^and I trust that those by
</p>
<p>whom I shall be condemned, may lay down their

<p>Baron Garjiow, then addressed Tidd as

<p>follows :  " Richard Tidd, do you wish to add

<p>voice, ** The first thing I have got to say is, that
</p>
<p>I had the misfortune to get acquainted with
</p>
<p>Brunt about a month before Christmas, by his
</p>
<p>frequently going to see Adams, who was living
</p>
<p>next door to me ; our windows joined ; by that
</p>
<p>means I became acquainted with him.
</p>
<p>" During the Christmas holidays, wc kept
</p>
<p>326 CATO-STIIEET CONSPIRACV.
</p>
<p>them together ; after the holidays, I was in-
</p>
<p>troduced to Edwards, who does not now appear
</p>
<p>against me ; he was constantly coming to me
</p>
<p>afterwards ; I always was a hard-working man,
</p>
<p>working sixteen and eighteen hours a day. I
</p>
<p>never had any time to spare, except on a Sunday.
</p>
<p>Messrs. Edwards and Brunt together told me
</p>
<p>that there were certain meetings going on.
</p>
<p>" I never attended any meeting after the acts
</p>
<p>to prevent illegal meetings, till Edwards told me
</p>
<p>that he had authority to state from persons high
</p>
<p>in rank, that meetings might take place to
</p>
<p>procure reform in Parliament. I was then in-
</p>
<p>troduced to a room, where I was taken to,, in
</p>
<p>Brunt's house. I did not see there any thing
</p>
<p>particular, till the Sunday when I w as proposed
</p>
<p>to take the chair.
</p>
<p>*v Certain propositions were then made, which
</p>
<p>made me declare I would never more attend such
</p>
<p>meetings, and I fully determined that I would
</p>
<p>not keep company with them afterwards. Prior
</p>
<p>to this Edwards came up to my house, and said,
</p>
<p>that he had got certain materials, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Thistlewood would be obliged to me if I would
</p>
<p>let them remain in my house. I said, I would
</p>
<p>allow no such thing. He then went away, but
</p>
<p>in the evening he came and brought the things,
</p>
<p>which the officers afterwards seized.
</p>
<p>*' On Tuesday, Edwards and Brunt came to
</p>
<p>me, and asked me if I kept to my determination
</p>
<p> they added, that all the proceedings that were
</p>
<p>going on were entirely flustered ; they then said
</p>
<p>there was to be a meeting of the Mary-le-bone
</p>
<p>Union, and asked me to go.

<p>" Edwards said, every body going there for
</p>
<p>self-])reservation took a weapon of defence. 1
</p>
<p>told him I had none ; he said, if I had not, tlic
</p>
<p>club would supply me with one ; he then pulled
</p>
<p>out a pistol, and said, you ought to arm yourself

<p>now.

<p>" ile also had a sword-stick, which he oftered
</p>
<p>me. He afterwards g-ave me a direction where
</p>
<p>the meetin<j; was to be held. I have it now in my
</p>
<p>pocket.  [Here the prisoner produced a small
</p>
<p>piece of paper, on which was wTitten these
</p>
<p>words:  ' Horse and Groom, John-street, Edge-
</p>
<p>ware-road."]
</p>
<p>Tidd then went on. " During Wednesday,
</p>
<p>while I was at work, Edwards and Brunt came to
</p>
<p>me, and said there was some ])eople I must bring
</p>
<p>to the club. I afterwards took jMonument, but I
</p>
<p>do declare before you I never knew any thing
</p>
<p>about a cabinet-dinner. It was never mentioned
</p>
<p>to me. I w^as introduced into the stable, and in
</p>
<p>ten minutes after the officers came in and ap-
</p>
<p>prehended me.
</p>
<p>" This is all I have to say, and you may de-
</p>
<p>pend I have told the truth."
</p>
<p>The Attarnci/ -General rose to reply, and pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to point out the various instances in
</p>
<p>which the evidence of Adams had been con-
</p>
<p>firmed : it was confirmed by ^Monument, who
</p>
<p>had not i)een deeply concerned in the plot ; but
</p>
<p>it was much more strongly confirmed by Hyden,
</p>
<p>wlio was no accomplice, and who was in every
</p>
<p>way worthy of belief. Tiiere was, he contended,
</p>
<p>a compleat chain of evidence, to prove that there
</p>
<p>was a conspiracy to overturn the government:
</p>
<p>and if they believed that the two prisoners at the
</p>
<p>])ar took a prominent part in it, they could
</p>
<p>have no hcjiitation as to the verdict they should
</p>
<p>give.
</p>
<p>Mr. Baron GarroiL', proceeded to deliver his
</p>
<p>cliarge to tlie Jury. He went over the whole of

</p>
<p>the evidence, and commented on all the material
</p>
<p>};arts of it i:i a most perspicuous manner. While
</p>
<p>his lordship was readmg over the evidence of
</p>
<p>Monument, tlie prisoner Davidson caused a
</p>
<p>written ])aper to be conveyed to him, and sp.id I'
</p>
<p>328 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>hoped it might be read as a part of his defence,
</p>
<p>which he had before forgot to notice. The
</p>
<p>learned Judge observed, that although it was not
</p>
<p>strictly regular to comply with the prisoner's
</p>
<p>request in the present stage of the business, yet
</p>
<p>he was ready to allow him to make any state-
</p>
<p>ment which might be of use to him. The state-
</p>
<p>ment was, that his (Davidson's') house had been
</p>
<p>searched, and nearly pulled down, and not the
</p>
<p>slightest evidence was there found which went
</p>
<p>to show that he had been guilty of any con-
</p>
<p>spiracy.
</p>
<p>After his Lordship had read over the evidence
</p>
<p>of Hyden, he said it was the most important of any
</p>
<p>that had been given to the Court, because the
</p>
<p>conspiracy had been communicated to him by one
</p>
<p>of the parties, who invited him to assist in it ; and
</p>
<p>because he went immediately and communicated
</p>
<p>to Lord Ilarrowby the danger wliich ministers
</p>
<p>were in. He pretended to show a readiness to
</p>
<p>join the conspirators, but he never did join them;
</p>
<p>and one reason for not refusing to take a part in
</p>
<p>the plot was, a threat held out that any man who
</p>
<p>did not join would be put to death.
</p>
<p>" The learned counsel for the prisoners had
</p>
<p>endeavoured to throw some discredit on this wit-
</p>
<p>ness, on the ground of his being an accomplice ;
</p>
<p>but there was not the slightest ground for such a
</p>
<p>supposition ; nor did it appear to him that the
</p>
<p>slightest inroad had been made on his testimony.
</p>
<p>On the contrary, he ought to be considered as an
</p>
<p>instrument in the hands of Providence in saving
</p>
<p>fifteen of the first men in the country, and perhaps
</p>
<p>many others, from destruction ; and all persons

</p>
<p>then present in Court, ought to consider them-
</p>
<p>selves indebted to him.
</p>
<p>" Here it was clearly in evidence, that the in-
</p>
<p>tention of the conspirators was to murder the
</p>
<p>most respectable and virtuous characters in the
</p>
<p>kingdom ; and that not content with that, they
</p>
<p>lUIAI. OF Tini) AND I ; A V I D3(' ,\ . 329
</p>
<p>were to destroy the house of the Bisho]) of Lon-
</p>

</p>
<p>who of all other men in the \N'orKl was the least
</p>
<p>likely to j^ivc oifenee to any hody.
</p>
<p>" What then eonld be their motive for all these
</p>
<p>unprovoked atroeities, but the ulterior olDJeet of
</p>
<p>revolution? If plunder was their objeel, where
</p>
<p>were the implements in whieli they were to earry
</p>
<p>away their plunder? What neecssity was there
</p>
<p>to add murder to their oflenee ? ^^'ilat oecasion
</p>
<p>had they for a box full of ball cartridges? A\'hat
</p>
<p>was their object in all tliis, but the ulterior object
</p>
<p>of etfecting- a revolution ? The usual argument of
</p>
<p>inadequacy of means had been used on this occa-
</p>
<p>sion ; and it was said, nothing certainly could be
</p>
<p>more |)re})osterous than to suppose a revolution
</p>
<p>could be t^ileeted by such contemptible means ;
</p>
<p>but it was proved, tliat a plan had been formicd 
</p>
<p>that a band of ruflians, reeking with the blood of
</p>
<p>the most illustrious men in the king'dom, had in-
</p>
<p>tended to overturn tlie government, b\' stirring up
</p>
<p>the people to insurrection.
</p>
<p>" Such men as these might imagine that the
</p>
<p>object could be etfectual, without ever considering
</p>
<p>the adequacy of the means. Before the com-
</p>
<p>mencement of the I'^rcnch Revolution, the iij'st be-
</p>
<p>ginnings were as contemptible as this ; and every
</p>
<p>body knew the vast extent and the wide-s])read-
</p>
<p>ing desolation, by which these small beginnings
</p>
<p>were lol lowed."'
</p>
<p>After a variety of other observations, all tend-
</p>
<p>ing to show that the evidence of the accom])liccs
</p>
<p>was confirmed in various instances by credible

</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the trial of Tidd and

<p>Davidson,
</p>
<p>Mr. CuRwooD addressed the Court, intimating
</p>
<p>n desire, on the part of James Wilson, to withdraw

<p>his plea of misnomer to the indictment against

<p>him for high treason, and to plead " Guilty," and

<p>the Attorney-General stating that he had no ob-

<p>jection to this course,
</p>
<p>James Wilson was put to the bar, and, on being

<p>questioned by Mr. Shelton, pleaded Guilty.

<p>the whole of these proceedings, and from what

<p>had passed imder his observation, he thought he

<p>should best consult the interests of the five un-

<p>SENTENCE OF DEATH.

<p>The following morning, Friday April 28lh, at a

<p>quarter after nine, Lord Chief-Justice Abbot,
</p>
<p>Chief Justice Dallas, the Chief Baron, ]Mr. Jus-

</p>
<p>Sergeant, took their seats.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brown, the gaoler, was immediately re-
</p>
<p>quested to bring the prisoners to the bar. In a
</p>
<p>few minutes the clank of chains was heard, and
</p>
<p>the eleven prisonei-s entered the court. Tliey

<p>Mr. Shelton (the clerk of the arraigns), address-

<p>should not receive judgment to die, according to

<p>law ?"
</p>
<p>Thistlewood immediately drew forth a manu-
</p>
<p>script address, which he proceeded to read in a
</p>
<p>mournful tone, as follows : 
</p>
<p>" My Lords,  1 am asked, my Lord, what I
</p>
<p>have to say that judgment of death should not be
</p>
<p>passed upon me according to law. This to me
</p>
<p>is mockery for were the reasons 1 could offer in-
</p>
<p>controvertible, and were they enforced even by
</p>
<p>the eloquence of a Cicero, still would the ven-

<p>as the right heir to a German Baron, who had

<p>been some time dead, and stated that Lords

<p>Castlereagh and Sidmouth had acknowledged his

<p>claims to the title and property, had interfered in
</p>
<p>his behalf with the German government, and

<p>supplied him with money to support his rank in

<p>society. From this period I date his career as a

<p>Government Spy.
</p>
<p>*' He procured an introduction to the Spenceans
</p>
<p> by what means I am not aware of  and thus he
</p>
<p>became acquainted with the Reformers in ge-
</p>
<p>neral.
</p>
<p>" When I met with Edwards after the massacre
</p>
<p>at Manchester, he described himself as very poor;
</p>
<p>and, after several interviews, he proposed a plan
</p>
<p>for blowing up the House of Commons. This
</p>
<p>was not my view : I wished to punish the guilty
</p>
<p>only, and therefore I declined it. He next pro-
</p>
<p>posed that we should attack the Ministers at the
</p>
<p>fete, given by the Spanish Ambassador. This I
</p>
<p>resolutely opposed, because the innocent would
</p>
<p>perish with the guilty ;  besides, there were
</p>
<p>ladies invited to the entertainment  and I, who
</p>
<p>am shortly to ascend to the scaffold, shuddered
</p>
<p>with horror at the idea of that, a sample of which
</p>
<p>had previously been given by the Agents of Go-

<p>vernment at Manchester, and which the Ministers
</p>
<p>of his Majesty applauded.

<p>" Edwards was ever at invention ; and at
</p>
<p>length he proposed attacking them at a cabinet-
</p>
<p>dinner. I asked, where were the means to carry
</p>
<p>his project into effect? He replied, if I would
</p>
<p>accede, we should not want for means. He was

<p>as good as his word : from him came, notwith-

<p>he was ever the most active ;  ever inducing

<p>people to join him, up to tlie last hour ere the
</p>
<p>undertaking was discovered.
</p>
<p>" I had witnesses in Court who could prove
</p>
<p>they went to Cato-street by appointment with
</p>
<p>Edwards, with no other knowledge or motive than
</p>
<p>that of passing an evening amongst his friends.
</p>
<p>" I could also have proved that subsequent to
</p>
<p>the fatal transaction, when we met in Holborn,
</p>
<p>he endeavoured to induce two or three of my
</p>
<p>companions to set fire to houses and buildings in
</p>
<p>various parts of the metropolis,
</p>
<p>" I could prove that subsequent to that again,
</p>
<p>he endeavoured to induce men to throw hand-
</p>
<p>grenades into the carriages of ministers as they
</p>
<p>passed through the streets ; and yet tliis man, the
</p>
<p>contriver, the instigator, the entrapper, is screened
</p>
<p>from justice and from ex})osurc, by those very
</p>
<p>men who seek vengeance agamst the victims of
</p>
<p>his and their villany.
</p>
<p>" To the Attorney and Solicitor-General I
</p>
<p>cannot impute the clearest motives. Their object
</p>
<p>seems to me to liave been rather to obtain a
</p>
<p>verdict against me, than to obtain a full and fair
</p>
<p>exposition of the whole affair since its com-
</p>
<p>mencement. If their object was justice alone,
</p>
<p>why not bring forward Edwards as a witness, if
</p>
<p>not as an accomplice ; but no, they knew that
</p>
<p>by keeping Edwards in the background, my proofs
</p>
<p> aye, my incontrovertible proofs of his being a
</p>
<p>hired spy, the suggestor and promoter  must,

<p>according to the rules of court, also be excluded.

<p>" V/itli respect to the immorality of our project,
</p>
<p>I will just observe, that the assassination of a
</p>
<p>tyrant has always been deemed a meritorious
</p>
<p>action. Brutus and Cassius were lauded to the
</p>
<p>very skies for slaying Csesar ; indeed, when any
</p>
<p>man, or any set of men, place themselves above the
</p>
<p>laws of their country, there is no other means of
</p>
<p>bringing them to justice than through the arm of
</p>
<p>a private individual. If the laws are not strong
</p>
<p>enough to prevent them from murdering the com-
</p>
<p>munity, it becomes the duty of every member
</p>
<p>of that community to rid his country of its op-
</p>
<p>pressors.
</p>
<p>" High treason was committed against the
</p>
<p>people at Manchester, but justice was closed
</p>
<p>against the mutilated, the maimed, and the friends
</p>
<p>of those who were upon that occasion indiscrimi-
</p>
<p>nately massacred. The Sovereign, by the advice
</p>
<p>of his Ministers, thanked the murderers, while yet
</p>
<p>reeking in the blood of their hapless victims I If
</p>
<p>one spark of honour  if one spark of patriotism 
</p>
<p>had still glimmered in the breasts of Englishmen,
</p>
<p>they would have risen to a man  for Insurrection
</p>
<p>then became a public duty  and the Blood of the
</p>
<p>Slain should have been the watchword to ven-
</p>
<p>geance on their murderers. The banner of inde-
</p>
<p>pendence should have floated in the gale that
</p>
<p>brought the tidings of their wrongs and their suf-
</p>
<p>ferings to the metropolis I  Such, however, was
</p>
<p>not the case, and Albion is still in the chains of
</p>
<p>slavery  I quit it without regret  I shall soon be

<p>consigned to the grave  my body will be immured

</p>
<p>It is impossible to describe the feelings of
</p>
<p>horror and disgust which pervaded the mind of
</p>
<p>every individual in the court during the delivery
</p>
<p>of this most treasonable and ferocious harangue.
</p>
<p>It was of course expected that the wretched cri-
</p>
<p>minals would offer something in extenuation of
</p>
<p>the crimes of which they had been convicted, but
</p>
<p>it could never have been conceived that any man
</p>
<p>existed so deeply depraved, and so dreadfully
</p>
<p>hardened in crime, as to venture to justify pro-
</p>
<p>jects of assassination, and to propogate doctrines
</p>
<p>of treason and murder, while standing as it were
</p>
<p>on the very brink of eternity, and about to be
</p>
<p>ushered into the presence of that God whoni he

<p>with an even hand. But this has not been the

<p>case with me ; 1 stand here helpless and friend-

<p>less. I endeavoured to shew that the evidence

</p>
<p>340 CATO STHEKT CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>against me was contradictory and incredible, and
</p>
<p>I hoped I had made an impression on the gentle-
</p>
<p>men in the box ; but the moment I was done, the
</p>
<p>Attorney-General got up, and told them that the
</p>
<p>evidence was pure and uncontaminated, and to
</p>
<p>this I may add, that Mr. Baron Garrow almost
</p>
<p>insisted that they should pronounce me guilty.
</p>
<p>" 1 would ask, has any person identified me
</p>
<p>but the officers ? who, every one knows, have at
</p>
<p>all times been instrumental in the death of inno-
</p>
<p>cent persons.
</p>
<p>" 1 do not now plead for my life ; I know I
</p>
<p>must fall a victim to the vengeance of my enemies.
</p>
<p>But in what manner have I been guilty of High
</p>
<p>Treason ? It would seem I was a silent spectator;
</p>
<p>none of the witnesses impute to me a single obser-
</p>
<p>vation. Now is this probable ? I had always got
</p>
<p>a great deal to say for myself, consequently I was
</p>
<p>not the person who would stand by without utter-
</p>
<p>ing a word ; and yet such has been the testimony
</p>
<p>of Adams.
</p>
<p>" Then, with regard to the blunderbuss ;  I
</p>
<p>have already explained that this was not mine,
</p>
<p>and that 1 acted in that affair entirely as the agent
</p>
<p>of Edwards. I have also declared how I came
</p>
<p>by the sword, and 1 now declare upon my soul,
</p>
<p>which will shortly appear before its Maker, that I
</p>
<p>never made any blow at any man, or discharged
</p>
<p>any carbine.
</p>
<p>" As forMunday, the man who swore that I had
</p>
<p>a long sword, with a pair of pistols in my girdle,
</p>
<p>who is he ? He is a poor labouring man who comes
</p>
<p>here for his day's pay and his victuals, to swear

<p>away the life of a fellow creature, and to support

<p>the unfounded charge against me that I meant to
</p>
<p>assassinate his Majesty's Ministers.
</p>
<p>" I appeal to any man, whether it is upon sucli
</p>
<p>evidence the life of an innocent man is to be sacri-
</p>
<p>ficed ? But even supposing, for the sake of argu-
</p>
<p>DAVIDSONS ^Pl-ECH, 34 1
</p>
<p>ment, that the lives of his Majesty's Ministers
</p>
<p>were threatened, it did not follow that this was to
</p>
<p>extend to the King himself.
</p>
<p>" In a passage of Magna Charta, it was ordained
</p>
<p>that twenty-tive barons sliould be nominated to
</p>
<p>see tliat the terms oi' the charter were not in-
</p>
<p>i'ring-ed : and, if it was found tliat his ^lajesty's
</p>
<p>Ministers were guilty of such infringement, then
</p>
<p>four barons were to call upon them for redress.
</p>
<p>If this were not granted, then the four barons
</p>
<p>were to return to their brethren, by whom the
</p>
<p>people were to be called together to take up arms,
</p>
<p>and assert their rights. Such an act was not con-
</p>
<p>sidered in old times as an act of treason towards
</p>
<p>the king, however hostile it might be towards his
</p>
<p>ministers. But this does not apply to me.
</p>
<p>*' I had no intention of joining in any scheme
</p>
<p>whatever, either to put down my King, or to
</p>
<p>murder his Ministers. I was entrapped by Gold-
</p>
<p>worthy and Edwards, in order for some private
</p>
<p>purposes of their own, that they might have my
</p>
<p>life sworn away.
</p>
<p>" I have no objection to tender my life in the
</p>
<p>service of my country ; but let me at least, for the
</p>
<p>sake of my children, save my character from the
</p>
<p>disgrace of dying a traitor. For my children only
</p>
<p>do I feel, and when 1 think of them 1 am deprived
</p>
<p>of utterance  1 can say no more."
</p>
<p>James 1 \GS was next asked what he had to
</p>
<p>say, why he should not receive judgment to die?
</p>
<p>lie replied 
</p>
<p>" I have very little to say. My abilities will
</p>
<p>not allow me to speak. If Mr. Edwards had not
</p>
<p>got acquainted with me I should not be here. He

<p>came to me, unfortunately when I had no l)usiness,
</p>
<p>nor no mearis of getting a livelihood for my
</p>
<p>family. 1 entered into the conspiracy only through
</p>
<p>him ; and it was only necessity, and the want of
</p>
<p>the means to support my wife and family that
</p>
<p>brought me here.

<p>*' It is only through Edwards that I shall lose
</p>
<p>my life. I do not mind dying, if you will let
</p>
<p>that man come forward, and die with me on the
</p>
<p>scaffold. It was through him that I was going
</p>
<p>to do that which, I must allow, was of a most
</p>
<p>disgraceful and inhuman nature.
</p>
<p>" On the other hand, his Majesty's Ministers
</p>
<p>conspire together, and impose laws to starve me
</p>
<p>and my family and fellow-countrymen ; and if I
</p>
<p>was going to assassinate these Ministers, I do
</p>
<p>not see that it is so bad as starvation, in my opi-
</p>
<p>nion, my Lord.
</p>
<p>" There is another thing, my Lord. A meeting
</p>
<p>was called at Memchester, under the protec-
</p>
<p>tion of the law of England, for which our fore-
</p>
<p>fathers died, and which King John signed in the
</p>
<p>open air. This meeting was called under the
</p>
<p>protection of that law, for the people to petition
</p>
<p>parliament to give them their rights ; but, pre-
</p>
<p>vious to the business of the meeting, the ]\Jan-
</p>
<p>chester yeomanry rode in among them, and cut
</p>
<p>down men, women, and children, in a manner
</p>
<p>that was a disgrace to the very name of English-
</p>
<p>men. These yeomen had their swords ground
</p>
<p>beforehand ; and I had a sword ground also : but
</p>
<p>1 do not see any harm in tlrat,
</p>
<p>*' I shall suffer, no doubt ; but I hope my
</p>
<p>children will live to see justice done to their
</p>
<p>bleeding country. I would rather die like a man
</p>
<p>than live like a slave. I am sorry 1 have not the
</p>
<p>power, gentlemen, to say more ; I shall, therefore,
</p>
<p>withdraw."

<p>manner ; and, m answer to the usual interrogatory,
</p>
<p>addressed himself to the Court in a firm and con-
</p>
<p>fident tone.
</p>
<p>lie said, he " had intended to have written the ob-
</p>

</p>
<p>what lie had before stated to the Jury on his
</p>
<p>trial, wliich had been so ably knocked down by
</p>
<p>the Solicitor-General, whose sophisticated elo-
</p>
<p>quence would make even crime a virtue. He
</p>
<p>then proceeded to recapitulate the circumstances
</p>
<p>already stated by him in his defence. lie pro-
</p>
<p>tested aj^ainst the verdict ; not that he valued his
</p>
<p>life. No man valued it less when it was to be
</p>
<p>sacrificed in liberty's cause.
</p>
<p>" Looking around him in this Court, and seeing
</p>
<p>the sword of justice and the inscriptions which
</p>
<p>were placed on the VN-alls above the Learned
</p>
<p>Judges, he could only say, that he felt his blood
</p>
<p>boil in his veins when he thought how justice was
</p>
<p>perverted, and her sacred name prostituted to the
</p>
<p>basest and vilest purposes. He was a man of his
</p>
<p>word, and not a shuttlecock, as some might sup-
</p>
<p>pose. If he pledged himself once to destroy a
</p>
<p>tyrant, he would do it.
</p>
<p>'' Edwards, that infamous villain, whom the
</p>
<p>Solicitor-General had not dared to bring forward,
</p>
<p>had preyed on his credulity; and Adams had
</p>
<p>betrayed iiim. Where was the benefit which would
</p>
<p>result to Christianity from the able defence made
</p>
<p>of it by the Solicitor-General ? What was Chris-
</p>
<p>tianity ? Why, did its doctrines promulgate so
</p>
<p>horrid an idea, as that supposing a man to have
</p>
<p>been a Deist, and all at once to have been con-
</p>
<p>verted by seeing the halter staring him in the
</p>
<p>face, he would, therefore, be strengthened by
</p>
<p>Almighty God to become a villain and a perjured
</p>
<p>betrayer of his associates?
</p>
<p>" That this was the case with Adams was evi-
</p>
<p>dent from his own confession. Was this, then,

<p>Christianity ? If it was, he prayed God he might
</p>
<p>die without it ; for very difierent, indeed, were
</p>
<p>the ideas he had formed of religion."
</p>
<p>The prisoner then proceeded to attack the
</p>
<p>character of the witness, Hale, his apprentice ; in
</p>
<p>which, however, he was interrupted by the Lord
</p>
<p>344 CATO-STRKKT CONSIM II AC V.
</p>
<p>Chief Justice, who said, he would not allow per-
</p>
<p>sons and witnesses not before the Court to be
</p>
<p>vilified.
</p>
<p>Brunt proceeded  " He had antipathy against
</p>
<p>none but the enemies of his country. Fie was a
</p>
<p>friend to the lower orders, and, as an honest man,
</p>
<p>had a fellow-feeling for his countrymen, who were
</p>
<p>starving through the conduct of Ministers, Lord
</p>
<p>Castlereagh and Lord Sidmouth had an antipathy
</p>
<p>against the people ; and if he did conspire to
</p>
<p>murder them, was that high treason ? He readily
</p>
<p>acknowledged that he had agreed to assassinate
</p>
<p>Ministers ; but he denied having ever conspired
</p>
<p>to dethrone or injure the Monarch. But, if re-
</p>
<p>sisting the Civil Power, or opposing wicked
</p>
<p>Ministers, was treason, then he confessed he was
</p>
<p>guilty. He was no traitor to his country  he was
</p>
<p>no traitor to his King; bat he was an enemy to a
</p>
<p>boroughmongering faction, which equally enslaved
</p>
<p>both the King and the people.
</p>
<p>" The liappiness, the glory, and the safety of
</p>
<p>the King, depended on his being free as well as
</p>
<p>his people ; but this was not the case now. A
</p>
<p>faction ruled both King and people with lawless
</p>
<p>sway. He Jiad, by his industry, been able to
</p>
<p>earn about three or four pounds a week ; and,
</p>
<p>while this was the case, he never meddled with
</p>
<p>politics : but, when he found his income reduced
</p>
<p>to ten shillings a week, he began to look about
</p>
<p>him, and to ask to what could that be owing ?
</p>
<p>And what did he find ? Why, men in power,
</p>
<p>who met to deliberate how they might starve and
</p>
<p>plunder the country. He looked on the Man-
</p>
<p>chester transactions as mostdreadlul, and thought

<p>that nothing was too severe for men, who had not
</p>
<p>only caused, but even applauded, the dreadful
</p>
<p>scenes which occurred there.
</p>
<p>" With pleasure would he die as a martyr in
</p>
<p>liberty's cause for the good of his country, and, to
</p>
<p>have been avenged on her tyrants would have
</p>
<p>brunt's SPEECTf. 345
</p>
<p>given him pleasure to have died on the spot. He
</p>
<p>was not a traitor, nor a friend of a traitor, and it
</p>
<p>was only a villain who could call him so. While
</p>
<p>a nerve of his body could move, that nerve should
</p>
<p>and would be exerted against the enemies of
</p>
<p>the people.
</p>
<p>" He had joined the conspiracy for the public
</p>
<p>good. He was not the man who would have
</p>
<p>stopped. O, no ; he would have gone through
</p>
<p>with it to the very bottom, or else have perished
</p>
<p>in the attempt. Their death was necessary for
</p>
<p>the public good. They might quarter his body 
</p>
<p>they might inflict on him every species of torture ;
</p>
<p>but they could not shake his resolution, nor subdue
</p>
<p>his spirit. He would mount the scaffold with
</p>
<p>the same firm intrepidity he now evinced, and, if
</p>
<p>his life was called for, if his wife was to be made
</p>
<p>a widow and his child an orphan, in this mighty
</p>
<p>cause he would cheerfully sacrifice it T'
</p>
<p>In the course of this daring address, the
</p>
<p>wretched man had worked himself up to a de-
</p>
<p>gree of passion bordering on rage. A feeling
</p>
<p>of horror was visible in the face of all within his
</p>
<p>hearing, whilst the unhappy man was coldly ex-
</p>
<p>plaining and justifying his murderous purposes.
</p>
<p>The same question was put to each of the re-
</p>
<p>maining prisoners, who severally returned
</p>
<p>answers to tlie following effect :
</p>
<p>Richard Tidd said, he had been convicted so
</p>
<p>late last night, that he had no time to prepare
</p>
<p>a written address, as he could have wished. He
</p>
<p>denied that the evidence against him was true,
</p>
<p>with the exception of that of the gentleman he
</p>
<p>saw on the bench (Captain Fitzclarcnce) ; and,

<p>was false.

<p>John Shaw Strange.  I have only this much

<p>to say, my Lords, that the evidence of Adams

<p>and liale was false, and that they are perjured

<p>villains.
</p>
<p>James Gilchrist was much affected, and
</p>
<p>some time elapsed before he could speak. He
</p>
<p>said 
</p>
<p>" My Lords, what I say, 1 shall say and think
</p>
<p>as in the presence of my God. I knew nothing
</p>
<p>of the business until four o'clock on the day on
</p>
<p>which it took place. I then had not tasted a
</p>
<p>morsel of food the whole day. [Here the
</p>
<p>prisoner burst into tears.] I then went to a
</p>
<p>place where a person appointed to meet me at
</p>
<p>six o'clock, where I saw four or five men, not one
</p>
<p>of whom I knew, except Cooper ; of him I bor-
</p>
<p>rowed a halfpenny, to buy a bit of bread. I
</p>
<p>appeal to God who now hears me, (casting up
</p>
<p>his eyes), and knows that this is true.
</p>
<p>" I went into the room at Cato-street, where
</p>
<p>I found a number of men eating bread and cheese,
</p>
<p>which they cut with a sword. I cut some for
</p>
<p>myself. Seeing so many men and arms, I was
</p>
<p>anxious to get away, but Adams stopped me, and
</p>
<p>brandishing a sword, said, ' If any man attempts
</p>
<p>to go from here, I will run him through.' An
</p>
<p>officer then came in, and 1 surrendered without

<p>burst into tears, and could proceed no further.]
</p>
<p>Charles Cooper said, My Lords, there is no

<p>evidence to convict me of high treason.

<p>SENTENCE OF DEATH, 347
</p>
<p>Gilchrist came again to the bar, and said,
</p>
<p>My Lords, I have no objection to die ; I would
</p>
<p>willingly resign my life to save that of another.
</p>
<p>(It was not known to whom he alluded). He
</p>
<p>again retired from the bar in tears as before,
</p>
<p>and continued so till the whole of the prisoners
</p>
<p>were removed from Court.
</p>
<p>Proclamation was now made by the Crier that
</p>
<p>the Judge was going to proceed to pass sentence
</p>
<p>on the prisoners, and enjoining strict silence in
</p>
<p>the Court.
</p>
<p>The Lord Chief-Justice Abbott, having put
</p>
<p>on that solemn part of the judicial insignia, the
</p>
<p>black velvet cap, proceeded to his awful duty,
</p>
<p>and thus addressed the prisoners : 
</p>
<p>" You, Arthur Thistlewood, James Ings, John
</p>
<p>Thomas Brunt, William Davidson, and Richard
</p>
<p>Tidd, have been severally tried and convicted of

</p>
<p>and Charles Cooper, did originally plead Not

<p>trial and conviction of the preceding prisoners,
</p>
<p>you desired to withdraw your plea, and plead
</p>
<p>Guilt//. You have cast yourselves on the mercy
</p>
<p>of your sovereign ; and if any of you have your
</p>
<p>lives spared, which I trust will be the case wiili
</p>
<p>some of you, I hope you will bear in mind that
</p>
<p>you owe it to the benignity and mercy of your
</p>
<p>sovereign, and to some of those public othcers
</p>
<p>whom you had devoted to a cruel and sudden

<p>death.

</p>
<p>His Lordship then proceeded with his address.
</p>
<p>" Thistlewood," he observed, '' had complained
</p>
<p>that the Court had refused to receive the testimony
</p>
<p>of some witnesses, after the evidence had closed
</p>
<p>on both Sides. But he should recollect that his
</p>
<p>oVo
</p>
<p>^I^
</p>
<p>348 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>trial was conducted according to the law, as it
</p>
<p>had been administered in this country for ages.
</p>
<p>The witnesses whom he proposed to call were
</p>
<p>for the purpose of impugning the testimony of a
</p>
<p>man of the name of Dwyer, and no other. His
</p>
<p>learned counsel had previously called witnesses
</p>
<p>to the same effect. It could not be allowed to
</p>
<p>him, according to the ordinary course of pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding, to do more. Indeed, even if he had
</p>
<p>been allowed so to do, it could have been pro-
</p>
<p>ductive of no advantage, because his case did not
</p>
<p>depend upon the evidence of that witness alone.
</p>
<p>This observation was confirmed by the fact, that
</p>
<p>in subsequent cases, where the evidence of
</p>
<p>Dwyer was altogether omitted, a similar verdict
</p>
<p>of guilty was returned.
</p>
<p>" Some of them had thought fit to say much of
</p>
<p>the character of a person who had not appeared
</p>
<p>as a witness upon this occasion. The Court
</p>
<p>could proceed only upon the evidence which was
</p>
<p>brought before it. Of the person, therefore, to
</p>
<p>whom they alluded, or of the practices of which
</p>
<p>he had been guilty, they could have no know-
</p>
<p>ledge. Upon the testimony, however, which had
</p>
<p>been adduced against them, there was abund-
</p>
<p>antly sufficient to induce a Jury of their coun-
</p>
<p>try to come to a conclusion, that the whole of

<p>were inflamed, and by which they were drawn

<p>from every feeling of morality, from every sense

<p>*' The treason of which they were charged,

<p>and found guilty, was that of compassing and

<p>imagining to levy war against his majesty, for
</p>
<p>the purpose of inducing him to change his mea-
</p>
<p>sures and Ministers ; the first step towards ef-
</p>
<p>fecting which was to have been the assassination

<p>of Ministers themselves. They had endeavoured
</p>
<p>now to complain of the testimony of those per-

</p>
<p>This was a crime which hitherto was a stranger
</p>
<p>to our country, and he trusted it would, after
</p>
<p>the melancholy example of the prisoners, be
</p>
<p>unknown amongst us.
</p>
<p>*' It now," he said, '* only remained for him to
</p>
<p>pass upon them the awful sentence of the law;
</p>
<p>but before he did so, he exhorted them, he im-
</p>
<p>plored them, to employ the time yet left to them
</p>
<p>in this life in endeavouring, by prayer, to obtain
</p>
<p>mercy from that Almighty Power before whom
</p>
<p>they would shortly appear. The mercy of hea-
</p>
<p>ven might be obtained by all those who would
</p>
<p>imfeignedly, and with humility, express contrition
</p>
<p>for their offences, and seek that mercy through
</p>
<p>the merits of their blessed Redeemer.'^
</p>
<p>This awful appeal, delivered by the judge in
</p>
<p>the most impressive manner, was wholly lost on
</p>
<p>Thistlewood, who, with apparent careless indif-
</p>
<p>ference, pulled out his snuff-box, some of the
</p>
<p>contents of which he took, casting his eyes round
</p>
<p>the court, as if he were entering a theatre. His
</p>
<p>indifference was the more conspicuous when con-
</p>
<p>trasted with the solemn manner in which the
</p>
<p>Lord Chief-Justice addressed the prisoners.
</p>
<p>His Lordship continued.
</p>
<p>" Whether the prisoners M'ould profit by the
</p>
<p>advice which he thus sincerely gave them he
</p>
<p>could not say, but he once again begged that
</p>
<p>they might not allow themselves to be led away
</p>
<p>by such feelings and opinions as seemed hitherto
</p>
<p>to have influenced them.
</p>
<p>" He had now to pronounce upon them the
</p>
<p>sentence of the law, which was

<p>And may God of his infinite goodness have

</p>
<p>The crier said aloud, " Amen!" in which he
</p>
<p>was joined by many in the Court, who were
</p>
<p>deeply atfected by his Lordship's address.
</p>
<p>The prisoners were then removed from the

<p>bar; some of them, particularly I'histlewood,

<p>PREPARATIONS FOR THE EXECUTION,

<p>AND
</p>
<p>CONDUCT OF THE PRISONERS.
</p>
<p>The public anxiety had been, as we have
</p>
<p>already stated, more than usually excited during
</p>
<p>the trials of the conspirators, and much curiosity
</p>
<p>was, of course, felt as what would be the final
</p>
<p>result, and on what particular day the unhappy,
</p>
<p>deluded wretches, would suffer the last dreadful
</p>
<p>sentence of the law. The public suspense M^as,
</p>
<p>however, terminated on Saturday, the day after
</p>
<p>the passing sentence of death, when his Majesty
</p>
<p>held a Privy Council, at which Newman Knowles,
</p>
<p>Esq., the Common-Serjeant of London, (in the
</p>
<p>absence of the Recorder through indisposition,)
</p>
<p>was admitted into the presence of the King, to
</p>
<p>make a Report of the persons convicted of the
</p>
<p>crime of High Treason before the Special Com-
</p>
<p>missioners, in which the Learned Serjeant was
</p>
<p>assisted by the Judges present, who tried the
</p>
<p>prisoners. The Council, at which his Majesty was
</p>
<p>present, assembled at two o'clock, and continued in
</p>
<p>deliberation till near four ; and, after the Report
</p>
<p>had been received, the Council proceeded to
</p>
<p>deliberate upon the fate of the prisoners, and
</p>
<p>upon the period when it might be proper the
</p>
<p>execution should take place.
</p>
<p>It was at length determined, with a view to
</p>
<p>render the example more imposing, and to mark
</p>
<p>the sense which was entertained of the atrocious
</p>
<p>offence of which tJie wretched culprits were found
</p>
<p>guilty, to order them for execution on the fol-

<p>directed that their bodies should be quartered
</p>
<p>was remitted.
</p>
<p>The sentence of death on Harrisox, Wilson,
</p>
<p>Cooper, Straxce, and Bradburx, was com-
</p>
<p>muted to transportation for life, in conformity
</p>
<p>with the implied pledge which they received when
</p>
<p>they agreed to plead Gidlti/ to the indictments ;
</p>
<p>and Gilchrist was respited, without mention of
</p>
<p>the commutation of punishment
</p>
<p>Mr. Brown, the Governor of Newgate, received
</p>
<p>the warrant at seven o'clock in the evenino^, and,
</p>
<p>accompanied by the Under-SherifF, immediate!}'-
</p>
<p>went to tlie condemned room, in which were
</p>
<p>sitting those wlio were ordered for execution,
</p>
<p>attended by eight ctlicers.
</p>
<p>When he entered, they rose in the most re-
</p>
<p>spectful mani.cr. lie held in his hand the Re-
</p>

<p>Mr. Brown addressed them in the following

<p>words:  ' i; Is my puiniiii outy to co^nmm^ieate

<p>manner, said  "The sooner we go. Sir, the hotter.

</p>
<p>shall apply to the authority by which I am con-
</p>
<p>vinced you will not be refused."
</p>
<p>Not a word was uttered by any one of the
</p>
<p>prisoners.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brown then said, '' Let me entreat ^ou
</p>
<p>with effect to give up your thoughts to the ;on-
</p>
<p>templation of the change which you are about to
</p>
<p>undergo. Your time in this hfe is very short ;
</p>
<p>devote it to repentance, and prayer to that Being
</p>
<p>who will not desert you at the moment of fatal
</p>
<p>separation."
</p>
<p>The prisoners did not speak, nor make any
</p>
<p>sign.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brown then left the room, and the miser-
</p>
<p>able men turned to the conversation in which they
</p>
<p>had been engaged before he entered, without
</p>
<p>any reference to the tidings they had just heard.
</p>
<p>Upon going to the condemned room where the
</p>
<p>six conspirators who pleaded guilty were confined,
</p>
<p>Mr. Brown observed a very striking contrast to
</p>
<p>the scene which he had just quitted, as far as
</p>
<p>regarded Strange, Bradburn, Cooper, and Gil-
</p>
<p>christ.
</p>
<p>He entered with the Recorder's warrant in his
</p>
<p>hand, which contained cheering intelligence to
</p>
<p>them. Strange, Bradburn, Cooper, and Gilchrist,
</p>
<p>seemed struck with consternation ; but Harrison
</p>
<p>and Wilson shewed no symptoms of agitation, but
</p>
<p>appeared rather to despise than to pity the
</p>
<p>deplorable condition of their companions, and
</p>
<p>uttered not a word expressive of hope or fear.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brown then informed them, that mercy had
</p>
<p>been extended to them, and that their lives were
</p>
<p>spared.

<p>Srange, Cooper, Bradburn, and Gilchrist, imme-
</p>
<p>diately fell on their knees, and, after a pause, gave
</p>
<p>utterance to incoherent and unmtelligible expres-
</p>
<p>sions of gratitude. Harrison and Wilson still re-
</p>
<p>maining silent, and apparently unmoved.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brown said, " I have now to show vou the
</p>
<p>CONDUCT OK THE PRISONKRS. 355
</p>
<p>dark side of the T)tcture. Your unfortunate mi-
</p>
<p>serable companions in crime who were tried, are
</p>
<p>ordered for execution on Monday morning; and
</p>
<p>you, Harrison, Wilson, Cooper, Strange, and
</p>
<p>Bradburn, arc transported for life."
</p>
<p>Wilson, who before had appeared perfectly cal-
</p>
<p>lous, now exclaimed, " Ah ! our poor friends ; I
</p>
<p>am indeed sorry for them." Harrison said no-
</p>
<p>thing; the others were too much occupied with
</p>
<p>the joy of their own escape to bestow a thought
</p>
<p>upon those who were to Ibrfeit their lives.
</p>
<p>]\Ir. Brown said, " There is one of the most re-
</p>
<p>markable circumstances attending your cases that
</p>
<p>ever took place upon any occasion ; and, if you
</p>
<p>have any feeling, it must make a deep and indelible
</p>
<p>impression upon you. Those very persons against
</p>
<p>whose lives your hands were about to be raised,
</p>
<p>are the men by whose intercession your lives have
</p>
<p>been saved."
</p>
<p>After Mr. Brown had performed so much of his
</p>
<p>painful task, he proceeded to another step, which
</p>
<p>excited in the breast of some of the prisoners a
</p>
<p>strong feeling of irritation, namely, to place them
</p>
<p>in separate condemned cells.
</p>
<p>They had entertained a hope that they would
</p>
<p>be permitted to si)end the last few^ hours of their
</p>
<p>life together, mutually to cheer each other by
</p>
<p>their example, and to obtain those consolations
</p>
<p>which the society of friends in so melancholy a
</p>
<p>situation must necessarily produce. Mr. Brown,
</p>
<p>however, had received his instructions, and was
</p>
<p>bound to attend to them, although he might him-
</p>
<p>self have been anxious to grant them every in-
</p>
<p>dulgence consistent with their safety.

<p>The five unhappy men, whose hours were now
</p>
<p>numbered, were each removed to the place ap
</p>
<p>pointed, and were still accompanied by two of the
</p>
<p>imder turnkeys.
</p>
<p>The reason assigned for this arrangement, was

<p>the existence of a spirit of hardihood among the

</p>
<p>unfortunate men, ^y}lich, while they remained to-
</p>
<p>gether, seemed but to jncreasc.
</p>
<p>In the early part of Saturday, they had been vi-
</p>
<p>sited by the licvcrend Mr. Coitoii (the Ordinary
</p>
<p>of Newgate}, ?nd evl:';rL':d i.^y him to have re-
</p>
<p>course to those T'rayers which had been t^o strongly
</p>
<p>and humanely recommended by the Lord Chief
</p>
<p>Justice. They were, however, deaf to his en-
</p>
<p>treaties, and conjointly told him, that however
</p>
<p>much they respected his motives, still that their
</p>
<p>minds were made up on religions subjects ; they
</p>
<p>were Deists, and therefore not inclined to join in
</p>
<p>that form of appeal to Heaven, which, in the ex-
</p>
<p>ercise of his sacred functions, he thought it neces-
</p>
<p>sary to suggest, Mv. CiA[..A iliidiiig iL.-ii Id-j ar-

<p>to that contrite fcelinLr, from which he could alcrie
</p>
<p>hope to bring them to a true sense of their situa-

<p>tion.
</p>
<p>On Sunday morning he re-commenced his pious
</p>
<p>labours, and on entering their ceils, repeated his
</p>
<p>former arguments ; but they again repeated their
</p>
<p>disbelief in the divinity of Christ, and refused
</p>
<p>through his mediation to seek pardon of their of-

</p>
<p>cated to Mr. l^rown, who, in the course of the
</p>
<p>morning attended at Whitehall, and reported

</p>

<p>the other cells were of the Tno-;t a'^nni/iug de-
</p>
<p>scription. 'I'iio nntnrtunate ehiidren, capable of
</p>
<p>nnder^'tandin .; rhe siciaiion (>l tiieir unhappy ])a-
</p>
<p>rents, were convulsed with s')rrow. 'j'he strongest

<p>ieelinjs of commiseration were excited m the

<p>358 CATO-STREET CONSPIUACV.
</p>
<p>minds of those whose painful duty it was to be
</p>
<p>present.
</p>
<p>Brunt formed a solitary exception to this re-
</p>
<p>mark. His composure on taking leave of his wife
</p>
<p>was of the most extraordinary description: he
</p>
<p>expressed himself in the most unmoved manner,
</p>
<p>and declared that the day of his execution would
</p>
<p>be to him the happiest of his life.
</p>
<p>The solemn service of the condemned sermon,
</p>
<p>usually preached in the chapel at Newgate, to
</p>
<p>repentant criminals, who are about to expiate
</p>
<p>their crimes with their blood, was on this occa-
</p>
<p>sion, reluctantly dispensed with. The miserable
</p>
<p>malefactors had so decidedly pronounced them-
</p>
<p>selves Deists, and (with the exception of David-
</p>
<p>son, and even he, until Sunday, had fully con-
</p>
<p>curred with them) had evinced in all parts of
</p>
<p>their conduct so awful a disregard of the precepts
</p>
<p>of Christianity and disbelief in its divine origin,
</p>
<p>as to excite an apprehension that their blasphemous
</p>
<p>principles would manifest themselves in some
</p>
<p>dreadful act of infidelity during divine service; it
</p>
<p>was therefore thought more prudent to omit the
</p>
<p>ceremony altogether, than to subject the adminis-
</p>
<p>tration of our holy religion to public insult by
</p>
<p>avowed and hardened infidels ; and this determi-
</p>
<p>nation was perfectly agreeable to the miserable
</p>
<p>beings themselves, who had boasted of being im-
</p>
<p>penetrable to repentance, and determined to end
</p>
<p>the brief remnant of their days in the same horrid
</p>
<p>anti-christian principles which they had throughout
</p>
<p>professed.
</p>
<p>In the course of Sunday, Alderman Wood
</p>
<p>called twice upon Mr. Brown, and requested to

</p>
<p>be introduced to the prisoners. Mr. Brown said
</p>
<p>he would willingly have complied with the worthy
</p>
<p>Alderman's request, but his instructions were,
</p>
<p>not to permit any person to have intercourse with
</p>
<p>the unhappy men, save their families, unless under
</p>
<p>the sanction of an order from the Privy Council.
</p>
<p>CONDUCT OF THK PRISONERS. 359
</p>
<p>Mr. Alderman Wood then begged that he would
</p>
<p>carry to the prisoners three written questions,
</p>
<p>and obtain the answers ; but this also Mr. Brown
</p>
<p>refused, upon the principle of the strict perform-
</p>
<p>ance of his duty.
</p>
<p>During nearly the whole of Sunday night, the
</p>
<p>deluded malefactors, who were attended by the
</p>
<p>city constables, slept soundly, and were only
</p>
<p>awakened by the unbarring of their cell doors, to
</p>
<p>admit the Reverend Ordinary. He found them
</p>
<p>in their separate cells, and went to each, urging
</p>
<p>every pious argument to reclaim them to the paths
</p>
<p>of Christianity.
</p>
<p>On Thistlewood, Tidd, Ings, and Brunt, how-
</p>
<p>ever, his arguments were unavailing ; but on Da-
</p>
<p>vidson his endeavours were crowned with suc-
</p>
<p>cess, and in the most fervent manner this unfor-
</p>
<p>tunate man joined in prayer with Mr. Cotton for
</p>
<p>mercy at the hands of his Redeemer.
</p>
<p>The cells in which these delinquents were
</p>
<p>confmed, though separated by strong walls of
</p>
<p>stone, were not sufficiently detaclied to prevent
</p>
<p>them from speaking to each other, and Ings,
</p>
<p>speaking, daring the night, of the approaching
</p>
<p>awful exhibition they were to make, remarked
</p>
<p>to one of his companions, with savage disap-
</p>
<p>pointment, " that there would be ])lcnty of per-
</p>
<p>sons present ; l)ut d  n the , they had no
</p>
<p>pluck." Indeed, it seemed impossible to divert
</p>
<p>the mind of this wretched man from the original
</p>
<p>object by which he h.ad been actuated; he often
</p>
<p>made declarations of the most terrific nature, and,
</p>
<p>amongst others, "he wished that liis l)ody might
</p>
<p>be conveyed to the King, and that his Majesty,

<p>or his cooks, might make turtle-soup of it !"'
</p>
<p>At five o'clock on Monday morning, ]\Ir. Cotton
</p>
<p>went again to the gaol, and proceeded to the
</p>
<p>condemned cells with the hallowed elements of
</p>
<p>the sacrament, which was administered to and
</p>
<p>received by Davidson with the utmost devotion.
</p>

</p>
<p>The Reverend Gentleman offered the same
</p>
<p>means of redemption to the other culprits, who,
</p>
<p>however, were immutable in their infidelity.
</p>
<p>Brunt partook of the wine oftered to him, but
</p>
<p>only for the purpose of drinking the King's health,
</p>
<p>which he appeared to do cordially. Davidson
</p>
<p>also drank the King's health, and joined fervently
</p>
<p>in the prayer for him and the Royal Family,
</p>
<p>which is in the established Church Service
</p>
<p>At six o'clock breakfast was ordered for the
</p>
<p>wretched men, and all but Davidson expressed
</p>
<p>a desire that they might be allowed to breakfast
</p>
<p>together. It was known, however, that they
</p>
<p>wished to arrange and mature what each should
</p>
<p>say upon the scaffold, and therefore Mr. Brov/n
</p>
<p>most prudently refrained from complying with
</p>
<p>this request.
</p>
<p>While these occurrences were taking place
</p>
<p>within the gaol, the exhibition W'ithout was not

<p>destitute of interest ; and the aiTangomcnts

</p>
<p>and Mr. Under-Slicriff Turner, had waited on
</p>
<p>Lord Sidmouth to arrange the mode in which the
</p>
<p>execution should take place. The plan at first
</p>
<p>proposed of erecting- a scatibld on the top of the
</p>
<p>])rison at the end near Newgate-street, was then
</p>
<p>co^isidered and abandoned, Lord Sidmouth being
</p>
<p>of opinion that there was no necessity for de-
</p>
<p>parting from the form customary on like oc-
</p>
<p>casions ; and, on the suggestion of Sheriff Roth-
</p>
<p>well, it was further resolved to dispense with
</p>
<p>that part of the sentence which directed that
</p>
<p>the culprits should be drawn on a hurdle to the
</p>
<p>place of execution, in consideration of the great
</p>
<p>inconvenience that might arise in conveying them
</p>
<p>along the streets in the manner which had been
</p>
<p>adopted on former occasions, namely, from the
</p>
<p>court-yard in front of the Sessions-house to the
</p>
<p>scaffold.
</p>
<p>On the return of Mv. Sheriff Rothwell and Mr.
</p>
<p>Under-Sheriff Turner, irom the office of the Secre-
</p>
<p>tary of State, with their final instructions, they
</p>
<p>directed Mr. Montague, one of the surveyors of
</p>
<p>public buildings in the city, to make the neces-
</p>
<p>sary arrangements for resisting the pressure of
</p>
<p>the crowd which was anticipated, and for enlarg-
</p>
<p>ing the ordinary scafibld to such a size as would
</p>
<p>admit of the performance of the more awful
</p>
<p>part of the ceremony  that of decapitating the
</p>
<p>criminals.
</p>
<p>To effect these works, a great number of
</p>
<p>men were suddenly called into requisition, and
</p>
<p>during the whole of Sunday they were actively
</p>
<p>engaged.
</p>
<p>The addition to the scaftbld was made in the

</p>
<p>the loud strokes of the carpenters' hammers soon
</p>
<p>attracted the attention of the passengers, hundreds
</p>
<p>of wliom mounted upon the wall to view what
</p>
<p>was going forward. The confusion createrl at
</p>
<p>this spot in(biced Mr. Montague to send to the

</p>
<p>Lord Mayor fur the aid of some constables, and
</p>
<p>in a short time the City Marshal, arrived at the head
</p>
<p>of several officers. The crowd was immediately
</p>
<p>removed from the wall, and order was restored
</p>
<p>Curiosity was next directed to the workmen at
</p>
<p>the ends of the various avenues leading to the
</p>
<p>Old Bailey, across which strong posts and rails
</p>
<p>were erected in such a manner as to prevent the
</p>
<p>distant crowd iTom throwing the whole of their
</p>
<p>weight on those in front, and thereby preventing
</p>
<p>that confusion and danger which otherwise would
</p>
<p>have been incurred, and which was productive
</p>
<p>of such melancholy consequences at the execution
</p>
<p>of Holloway and Haggertv, for the murder of
</p>
<p>Mr. Steel*.
</p>
<p>There were double rows of rails across the top
</p>
<p>of the Old Bailey, across Newgate-street, Gill-
</p>
<p>Bpur- street, Skinner-street, Fleet-lane, and in fact
</p>
<p>at the mouth of every approach to the prison.
</p>
<p>In the course of Sunday morning Mr. Sheriff
</p>
<p>Roth well and Mr. Under* Sheriff Turner held a
</p>
<p>consultation with the Lord Mayor, as to the neces-
</p>
<p>sity of applying to the Secretary of State for the
</p>
<p>Home Department, to direct the attendance of a
</p>
<p>military force, not alone in the prison, but in its
</p>
<p>immediate vicinity.
</p>
<p>The result of their deliberations was, that such
</p>
<p>an application was highly proper ; and accordingly
</p>
<p>Mr. Turner was despatched to Whitehall, with a
</p>
<p>letter to Lord Sidmouth, intimating the wdsh of
</p>
<p>the Lord Mayor. Li consequence of this appli-
</p>
<p>cation, in the course of the afternoon one hundred
</p>
<p>men were ordered to proceed to the gaol of New-
</p>
<p>gate, and a detachment of fifty was quartered in

</p>
<p>Other detachments were on duty at a short
</p>
<p>distance from the prison. Li fact, every possible
</p>
<p>precaution was adopted to prevent disturbance or
</p>
<p>disorder.

</p>
<p>As the eveniiiij^ advanced, the throng in front of
</p>
<p>tlie prison increased, and at eight o'clock the pres-
</p>
<p>sure was so great, that it required the utmost
</p>
<p>exertions of the constables on duty to prevent
</p>
<p>the interruption of the workmen. Thousands
</p>
<p>of all ranks and ages congregated in front of the
</p>
<p>gaol.
</p>
<p>The scaffold liad been brought forth from the
</p>
<p>Court-yard, and the carpenters were busily em-
</p>
<p>ployed in erecting the additional platform, which
</p>
<p>was ten feet square, and constructed with great
</p>
<p>solidity. They continued their o])erations by
</p>
<p>torch-light, which seemed as it were but to make
</p>
<p>*' darkness visible,'" and considerably enhanced
</p>
<p>the solemnity of the scene.
</p>
<p>Such was the anxiety of some to witness the
</p>
<p>execution, that they literally determined to remain
</p>
<p>in the neighbourhood all night, and thousands
</p>
<p>sacrificed their natural rest to the gratification of
</p>
<p>their curiosity.
</p>
<p>Tlie v.indov/s of the houses in the Old Bailey
</p>
<p>and the streets adjacent, commanding a view of
</p>
<p>the scaffold were let out at exorbitant prices.
</p>
<p>The sums demanded for a view from the windows
</p>
<p>were from ten shillings to two guineas, but even
</p>
<p>at these prices there was a superabundance of ap-
</p>
<p>plicants.
</p>
<p>Very early on Monday morning, the bar, which
</p>
<p>had previously been bounded but by one rank of
</p>
<p>spectators, was enclosed by a second, and the
</p>
<p>assembling populace soon began to assume the
</p>
<p>appearance of a crowd. They stood in immense
</p>
<p>masses by the time the clock struck five.
</p>
<p>An idea partially prevailed, that the area imme-

<p>diately without the rail which encompassed the
</p>
<p>scaffold, where on ordinary occasions spectators
</p>
<p>are allowed to stand, would be cleared out wiien
</p>
<p>the constables arrived, and this induced many to
</p>
<p>take their stations beyond the first barrier. This

</p>
<p>apprehension turned out to be weli-lbiinded ; and,
</p>
<p>at a quarter past five, those who had been for
</p>
<p>hours clinging to the hnier rail were obliged reluct-
</p>
<p>antly to abandon the situations in which they
</p>
<p>had proposed to witness the execution. No
</p>
<p>exceptions were made ; and none but officers, and
</p>
<p>those engaged to assist in the preparations, were
</p>
<p>suffered to remain. Compelled to retire from the
</p>
<p>innnediate vicinity of the scaffold, they attempted
</p>
<p>to take np a position beyond the first rail, but
</p>
<p>they were again disappointed, and the officers still
</p>
<p>pressed on them till they had retreated beyond
</p>
<p>the second bar, which was placed at the very
</p>
<p>extremity of the Old Bailey, on a line with i\ew-
</p>
<p>gate-street.
</p>
<p>The lamp-iron which is fixed in the wall of tlie
</p>
<p>prison between the corner of the street and the
</p>
<p>Debtor's door had been climbed by three persons,
</p>
<p>and that at the corner was taken possession of in
</p>
<p>the same way. Both w^ere now relieved from the
</p>
<p>the load which they had sustained for hours. The
</p>
<p>pump, and the lamps above it, were crowded to
</p>
<p>an extraordinary degree. The situation appeared
</p>
<p>one of danger, but those who had taken the
</p>
<p>trouble to ascend it were suffered to remain.
</p>
<p>When the crowed had passed the second bar
</p>
<p>(that which crossed the road from the end of New-
</p>
<p>gate-street), it was immediately lined with con-
</p>
<p>stables. In the opposite direction, a similar course
</p>
<p>v\ as taken, and a bar erected a little below the
</p>
<p>Felons' door precluded on that side any closer
</p>
<p>approach.
</p>
<p>An extensive area was thus taken from the
</p>
<p>ground which the populace on ordinary occasions

<p>are sufi'ered to occupy. The precautions ado])ted
</p>
<p>on this occasion greatly surpassed those resorted
</p>
<p>to on tluit of BcllinghanVs execution ; but placards

</p>
<p>against the pressure of the crowd, were thought
</p>
<p>unnecessary.
</p>
<p>Between five and six o'clock a great quantity
</p>
<p>of sawdust was brought out and deposited beneath
</p>
<p>the scaftbld on wliich the decollations were to be
</p>
<p>performed. It was shortly afterwards transferred
</p>
<p>to the top of it, and at the same time black cloth
</p>
<p>was brought, and the scafiold erected in the rear
</p>
<p>of the drop was completely covered w^ith it. The
</p>
<p>posts which sustained the chains above it received
</p>
<p>the same sable attire ; and while these prepara-
</p>
<p>tions were in progress, every avenue leading into
</p>
<p>the Old Bailey was carefully secured by strong
</p>
<p>wooden rails fixed across, and guarded by con-
</p>
<p>stables.
</p>
<p>At twenty minutes before six, a party of the
</p>
<p>Foot Guards (sixty- one in number) came out of
</p>
<p>the prison by the felons"-door ; they passed down
</p>
<p>Brown's-yard, opposite Newgate, where they
</p>
<p>were ordered to remain till their services should
</p>
<p>be required. At the same time, a detachment
</p>
<p>moved doAvn Newgate-street towards the City, to
</p>
<p>secure the peace of the metropolis, should it be
</p>
<p>in any manner threatened.
</p>
<p>Before six o'clock, the City-Marshals arrived ;
</p>
<p>and Mr. Sheriff Rothwell made his appearance at
</p>
<p>at the same moment, lie was not accompanied
</p>
<p>by his colleague, the Junior Sheriti'. He carefully
</p>
<p>inspected the preparations for the awful business
</p>
<p>of the morning. The crowd, ])efore repressed
</p>
<p>beyond the felons'-door, were about this time
</p>
<p>compelled to move still lower down towards
</p>
<p>Ludgate-hill.
</p>
<p>Mr. Alderman Wood also arrived on the spot

<p>very early in the morning ; and, on first going
</p>
<p>into My. Brown's office, expressed considerable
</p>
<p>indignation at his not being sufiered to commune
</p>
<p>with the convicts when he called at Newgate on
</p>
<p>Sunday; stating that the gaol was no longer
</p>
<p>under the direction of the citv, but under that of

</p>
<p>Lord Sidmoiiih, orders having been issued irom
</p>
<p>the Secretary of State's office, to suffer no one to
</p>
<p>see these convicts, unless by a properly authenti-
</p>
<p>cated order.
</p>
<p>At six o'clock the constables assembled in im-
</p>
<p>mense numbers, and the firemen from the different
</p>
<p>insurance-offices were among them.
</p>
<p>Shortly after six, the City-Marshal called
</p>
<p>over the names of the officers in attendance
</p>
<p>from the different City wards. This done, they
</p>
<p>were formed into several parties, and its proper
</p>
<p>station was assigned to each.
</p>
<p>At this time the Lord-Mayor attended, and, ac-
</p>
<p>companied by the City-Marshal superintended the
</p>
<p>whole of the arrangements.
</p>
<p>During the time occupied by the preparations
</p>
<p>above described, the conduct of the countless
</p>
<p>thousands assembled on this av/fully interesting
</p>
<p>occasion was peaceable in the extreme. Curiosity
</p>
<p>seemed powerfully excited; but no ])olitical feeling-
</p>
<p>was manifested by any part of the crowd, and
</p>
<p>they awaited the termination of the dreadful scene
</p>
<p>in silence. Sometimes a low murmur ran through
</p>
<p>the expecting multitude, as some new object con-
</p>
<p>nected with the proceedings was pressed on th^eir
</p>
<p>attention ; but it was a murnnir of surprise or of
</p>
<p>interest, which never took the tone of clamorous
</p>
<p>disapprobation.
</p>
<p>For a rescue  if it was ever contemplated  all
</p>
<p>hopes of accomplishing it must have been annihi-
</p>
<p>lated by the precautions we have enumerated.
</p>
<p>The powerful ibrce assembled on the spot must
</p>
<p>have convinced the most frantic Radicals that all

</p>
<p>It was generally reported that the execution
</p>
<p>would take place an hour before the usual time of
</p>
<p>execution. At a quarter before seven, the ]km--
</p>
<p>sons accommodated at the top of the prison were
</p>
<p>ob,vr\rd to .retire from the i'ront of the buiidin^:.

</p>
<p>This, in conse((uence of tlie rumour just alluded
</p>
<p>to, caused it to be generally surmised that the
</p>
<p>prisoners were about to be led out immediately.
</p>
<p>The rumour, however, proved to be unfounded.
</p>
<p>At seven o'clock, the crowd which was collected
</p>
<p>about the prison, in every avenue leading to it, or
</p>
<p>commanding- the most distant glimpse of its walls,
</p>
<p>was beyond all calculation ; but still there was not
</p>
<p>the least appearance of disorder. In lact, such
</p>
<p>were the formidable preparations to preserve the
</p>
<p>peace, that no possible alarm could exist. In the
</p>
<p>event of a riot, however, the Lord Mayor was
</p>
<p>prepared with large boards on poles, ready to be
</p>
<p>used, should it become necessary to read the Riot
</p>
<p>Act. They were brought within the rail which
</p>
<p>enclosed the gallows; and bills were immediately
</p>
<p>nailed to them, containing, in large characters,
</p>
<p>the following words :
</p>
<p>THE RIOT-ACT HAS BEEN READ.
</p>
<p>DISPERSE IMMEDIATELY.
</p>
<p>These were then laid down on each side of the
</p>
<p>debtors'-door. Of course they were not exhibited
</p>
<p>to the populace, being only pre})ared to be used
</p>
<p>in case of necessity, that, if unhappily it should
</p>
<p>become the duty of the civil authorities to have
</p>
<p>recourse to so strong a measure, it might be im-
</p>
<p>possible for the multitude to be ignorant of the
</p>
<p>peril to which they would be exposed by neg-
</p>
<p>lecting to yield prompt obedience to the mandate.
</p>
<p>A party of the Life (iuards was stationed to-
</p>
<p>wards the lower end of the Old-Bailey, and a
</p>
<p>small detachment appeared at the end next St.
</p>
<p>Sepulchre's Church. On a sudden a loud noise
</p>
<p>attracted the attention of every one ; this was

<p>caused by the awkward situation in which a
</p>
<p>person had placed himself, who. having got within
</p>
<p>the second bar, had clambered up against one "f"
</p>
<p>the houses, where the ct)nstables, who felt it tlnMr
</p>
<p>368 cato-strei:t coxspiiiacy.
</p>
<p>duty to remove him, could not get at him. He
</p>
<p>was at length pulled down by the heels, amidst
</p>
<p>the boisterous laughter of the crowd, who in this
</p>
<p>manifested all the thoughtlesss levity of a common
</p>
<p>mob  a levity not milike that described by the un-
</p>
<p>fortunate Hackman to have preceded the execu-
</p>
<p>tion of Dr. Dodd*.
</p>
<p>Several persons of distinction  among others
</p>
<p>some military officers of rank  arrived in the
</p>
<p>course of the morning, and Mr. Brown, the gaoler,
</p>
<p>afforded them accommodation in his house. They
</p>
<p>took their places at the drawing-room windows,
</p>
<p>and were thus enabled to command an excellent
</p>
<p>view of the whole melancholy scene.
</p>
<p>Shortly after seven o'clock, the executioner
</p>
<p>made his appearance on the drop, and placed the
</p>
<p>steps by which he was to ascend to tie the
</p>
<p>sufferers to the fatal beam. The saw-dust, which
</p>
<p>had been previously collected in two small heaps
</p>
<p>on the second scaffold, was now spread over the
</p>
<p>boards.
</p>
<p>The coffins were then brought out, and placed
</p>
<p>on the saw-dust, the foot of each being put so as
</p>
<p>nearly to touch the platform, from which those
</p>
<p>who were to fill them were to be launched into
</p>
<p>eternity. They had no lids on them. The coffin
</p>
<p>of Thistlewood was first lifted out. The third
</p>
<p>coffin brought out appeared longer than the
</p>
<p>others, and was supposed to be intended for
</p>
<p>Davidson, who was the tallest man ; but this
</p>
<p>conjecture proved erroneous.
</p>
<p>The persons employed to bring the coffins swept
</p>
<p>out the large one, and then proceeded to throw
</p>
<p>saw-dust into tliem, that the blood of the sufferers

</p>
<p>might not find its way through.
</p>
<p>The block was now brought up, and placed at
</p>
<p>the head of the first coffin. Most of the specta-
</p>
<p>tors were surprised at the shape of the block, as.

</p>
<p>instead of presenting a flat surface, it was slanted
</p>
<p>off, so that the top of it was quite sharp.
</p>
<p>The awful moment was now rapidly approach-
</p>
<p>ing when the ill-fated men were to be removed
</p>
<p>to another world. Each of them conversed
</p>
<p>freely with the officer^^ who had them in charge,
</p>
<p>and severally declared that moment to be the hap-
</p>
<p>piest of their lives.
</p>
<p>Davidson alone continued to pray fervently to
</p>
<p>the moment of his removal ; but the others seemed
</p>
<p>perfectly unmoved by their approaching fate.
</p>
<p>The six prisoners who had received the royal
</p>
<p>clemency, had been previously removed to another
</p>
<p>part of the prison, under the care and superin-
</p>
<p>tendence of a turnkey.
</p>
<p>The four before-mentioned, viz. Strange, Cooper,
</p>
<p>Bradburn, and Gilchrist, continued to express
</p>
<p>themselves in the most grateful and enthusiastic
</p>
<p>terms, that their lives had been saved through the
</p>
<p>kind and benevolent interposition of those illus-
</p>
<p>trious personages whose lives were intended to fall
</p>
<p>sacrifices to their diabolical project; but Wilson
</p>
<p>and Harrison persisted in the most obstinate in-
</p>
<p>difference to the mercy which had been so gra-
</p>
<p>ciously extended towards them. During the
</p>
<p>night and morning, they became excessively
</p>
<p>uneasy; and, while they wept for the ignominious
</p>
<p>fate of their companions, they expressed a wish
</p>
<p>that they might have been participators in its
</p>
<p>consequences, horrible as they were.
</p>
<p>About half-past seven o'clock, the Sheriffs,
</p>
<p>Under-Sheriffs, several young noblemen, and a
</p>
<p>number of gentlemen, walked in the procession
</p>
<p>(as is usual) through the various passages in

<p>Newgate, till they arrived at the door of the con-
</p>
<p>demned cells, which comes into the press-yard.
</p>
<p>The unlmppy criminals, since receiving sentence
</p>
<p>of death, had been confined in the lower ward of
</p>
<p>tlie prison assigned to capital convicts.
</p>
<p>Thistle wood came out of the condemned cell

<p>first; he bowed to the Sherifts and gentlemen
</p>
<p>present; he looked very pale, he cast up his
</p>
<p>eyes, and said, " It appears fine." He displayed
</p>
<p>uncommon firmness, and held out his hands for
</p>
<p>the assistant executioner to tie them. He observed
</p>
<p>to the persons near him, that he never felt in
</p>
<p>better spirits in the course of his life. He was
</p>
<p>attired in the same apparel that he wore during-
</p>
<p>his trial. The composure he exhibited was
</p>
<p>striking ; but there was nothing like bravado or
</p>
<p>carelessness. He now advanced to the block to
</p>
<p>have his irons knocked off"; and, while the turnkey
</p>
<p>was in the act,
</p>
<p>Mr. Alderman Wood advanced to Thistlewood,
</p>
<p>and said, " Thistlewood, I wish you to give me
</p>
<p>an answer to two or three questions."
</p>
<p>Mr. Sheriff Rothwell  " Mr. Alderman, I must
</p>
<p>interfere. I am sure you have had quite expe-
</p>
<p>rience enough of magisterial duties to know, that
</p>
<p>on a solemn occasion of this kind, you ought not
</p>
<p>to interfere with a prisoner on the point of
</p>
<p>death."
</p>
<p>Mr. Alderman Wood  " You prevented me, Mr.
</p>
<p>Sheriff', from entering Newgate yesterday, to
</p>
<p>obtain the information I am now about to seek.
</p>
<p>You have no authority to prevent me from now
</p>
<p>having it, as the gaol is this day under the super-
</p>
<p>intendence of Lord Sidrnouth ; and I must persist
</p>
<p>in obtaining answers to my questions, if the pri-
</p>
<p>soner chooses to give them."
</p>
<p>Mr. Sheriff Rothwell  " I cannot suffer you to
</p>
<p>disturb the quiet of this unhappy man's mind at
</p>
<p>this awful moment, Mr. Alderman. I must, by
</p>
<p>virtue of my office, interfere, and prevent you

</p>
<p>Mr. Sheriff Ilothictll  " Well, I must again

<p>object. I think it highly improper."
</p>
<p>Mr. Alderman Wood  " I have the questions
</p>

<p>Tliistlewood, when did yon first become ac-

</p>

</p>
<p>Mr. Alderman Wood  " Where did you become
</p>
<p>acquainted wath Edwards ?"
</p>
<p>T/iistleicood  " At Preston's."'
</p>
<p>Mr. Alderman Wood, who did not appear to have
</p>
<p>heard the final letter, said, " At Preston, in Lan-
</p>
<p>cashire ?"
</p>
<p>Thistlewood  " No : at Preston's, the shoe-
</p>
<p>maker."
</p>
<p>Mr. Alderman Wood  " Did he ever give you any

<p>money ? '
</p>
<p>Thisileirood  " Yes, I had a little from him, a

<p>pound-note at a time."
</p>
<p>The Worthy Alderman wrote down the answers
</p>
<p>he had received to his questions.
</p>
<p>Mr. Sheriff Roth well appeared extremely angry
</p>
<p>at the course taken by the Worthy Alderman,
</p>
<p>while his colleague, Mr. Sherift' Parkins, expressed
</p>
<p>his warm approbation of it.
</p>
<p>Tidd next made his appearance ; he came out
</p>
<p>of the cell into the Press-yard with an air of
</p>
<p>assumed gaiety. He smiled during the time he
</p>
<p>was being })inioned, and continued quite cheerful
</p>
<p>during the time his irons were knocking off. The
</p>
<p>moment his legs were free from their burden, he
</p>
<p>ran towards Thistlewood, who had taken a seat

</p>
<p>on a bench (placed in the yard for the purpose),
</p>
<p>and said, " Well, Mr. Thistlewood, how do you
</p>
<p>do ?' and they shook hands most heartily. This-
</p>
<p>tlewood said, '* He was never better," Tidd

<p>with tlie turnkey, while he was driving the rivets
</p>
<p>out of his irons, and composedly assisted the
</p>
<p>man in taking them off,
</p>
<p>Ings then came out of the cell, and danced as
</p>
<p>he came down the steps along the yard. He was
</p>
<p>dressed in his usual cfothes as a butcher, a rough
</p>
<p>pepper-and-salt coloured worsted jacket, and a
</p>
<p>dirty cap. During the time his hands were being-
</p>
<p>tied he became thoughtful, afterwards he seemed
</p>
<p>hurried and in great mental pain; but before his
</p>
<p>irons were knocked off he began to laugh and
</p>
<p>shout, and afterwards took a seat by the side of
</p>
<p>his fellow-sufferers.
</p>
<p>Brunt was then brought into the Press-yard ;
</p>
<p>he was perfectly composed, but looked round
</p>
<p>eagerly to see his wretched companions.- lie
</p>
<p>nodded to them, and then held out his hands to
</p>
<p>have them tied. He said nothing during the time
</p>
<p>he was being pinioned and having his irons taken
</p>
<p>off; but afterwards he addressed Thistlewood,
</p>
<p>Tidd, and Ings ; he told them to keep up their
</p>
<p>spirits, and to one of his companions he said,
</p>
<p>" All will soon be well."
</p>
<p>Davidson was then brought out of his cell ; he
</p>
<p>seemed a little affected at the sight of his compa-
</p>
<p>nions, but soon regained that composure which
</p>
<p>he evinced during the trials. His lips moved;
</p>
<p>but he did not betray much anxiety till his irons
</p>
<p>were knocked off. He then looked wildly at the
</p>
<p>Rev. Mr. Cotton, and appeared to be in prayer,
</p>
<p>very devoutly ; the others declared they were
</p>
<p>about to die in peace with all mankind, but that
</p>
<p>they had all made up their minds on rehgious
</p>
<p>matters, and were determined to die Deists.

</p>
<p>Davidson took the sacrament in the morning at
</p>
<p>six o'clock, from Mr. Cotton, and prayed most
</p>
<p>fervently. He also joined the Rev. Gentleman
</p>
<p>in a prayer for the prosperity of his Majesty
</p>
<p>King George IV., though he avowed he had nc t

</p>
<p>the same feeling for his ministers. A glass of
</p>
<p>wine was offered to Thistlewood, who politely-
</p>
<p>refused. Tidd and Brunt took a glass each.
</p>
<p>The irons of the culprits were then knocked off
</p>
<p>in succession. Thistlewood requested Mr. Cotton
</p>
<p>to speak to him, but for no other motive than to
</p>
<p>request he would observe his conduct had been
</p>
<p>manly, and to state that he was perfectly happy,
</p>
<p>and died in peace with God.
</p>
<p>Even to the last moment, the attentions of the
</p>
<p>Reverend Ordinary to the four men whom w^e
</p>
<p>have pointed out were unavailing: to every re-
</p>
<p>monstrance he offered, the only answer was, they
</p>
<p>wanted no assistance of his, their minds were
</p>
<p>perfectly made up on religious subjects, and they
</p>
<p>believed they should receive mercy at the hands
</p>
<p>of God.
</p>
<p>When the awful ceremony of pinioning the cul-
</p>
<p>prits by the yeoman of the halter was concluded,
</p>
<p>they each shook hands, and most fervently ex-
</p>
<p>claimed, " God bless you." The Reverend Mr.
</p>
<p>Cotton then began to read the burial service, com-
</p>
<p>mencing at the words " I am the resurrection and
</p>
<p>the life, ' ^c, and, the arrangements being com-
</p>
<p>pleted, the procession advanced through the dark
</p>
<p>passages of the gaol, led by the Sheriffs and
</p>
<p>Under- Sheriffs. The Reverend Mr. Cotton moved
</p>
<p>first,
</p>
<p>Thistlewood followed, with his eyes fixed, as
</p>
<p>it were, in abstract thought, and apparently lost
</p>
<p>to his situation. A vacant and unmeaning stare
</p>
<p>pervaded his countenance, which seemed un-
</p>
<p>moved by the devotions of the pious Ordinary.
</p>
<p>Tidd walked next, and although somewhat

<p>affected by his situation, his manner was collected,
</p>
<p>manly, and unaffectedly firm.
</p>
<p>Ings came next, and was laughing without
</p>
<p>reserve, and used every forced effort to subdue
</p>
<p>the better feelings of nature, which might remind
</p>
<p>him of his awiul situation; his conduct \Na-

</p>
<p>more like a delirium of fear than an effect of
</p>
<p>courage.
</p>
<p>Brunt, in fixed and hardened obduracy of mind,
</p>
<p>next advanced, and with a sullen and morose air
</p>
<p>of indifterence surveyed the officers who were
</p>
<p>conducting him to his fate.
</p>
<p>The unhappy Davidson came last, with clasped
</p>
<p>Iiands and uplifted eyes, praying most devoutly ;
</p>
<p>and the officers of the gaol closed the mournful
</p>
<p>procession.
</p>
<p>On their arrival at the Lodge, from which the
</p>
<p>Debtors'-door leads to the scaffold, a moment's
</p>
<p>pause took place, while the dreadful parapher-
</p>
<p>nalia of death were adjusted without. Thistle-
</p>
<p>wood, who stood first, clasped his lips, and with
</p>
<p>a frown surveyed, from the door-\/ay in which he
</p>
<p>stood, the awful preparations for his fate.
</p>
<p>The Under- Sheriff", at this period stepped into
</p>
<p>the road from the Governor's house, to ascertain
</p>
<p>how far the preparations had proceeded. Every
</p>
<p>thing seemed to be completely arranged. A
</p>
<p>party of the Horse-Guards seemed about to pass
</p>
<p>the barrier beyond which they had previously
</p>
<p>been stationed, but they did not persevere, in
</p>
<p>consequence of the difficulty of penetrating the
</p>
<p>crowd.
</p>
<p>The persons who had previously retired from
</p>
<p>the front of the prison now (at twenty minutes
</p>
<p>before eight) returned to their old places on the
</p>
<p>top of it. This, with other circumstances just
</p>
<p>particularized, announced that the culprits were
</p>
<p>about to be conducted to the scaffold.
</p>
<p>The re- appearance of the executioner, and the
</p>
<p>solemn sound of the bell, removed all doubt on

<p>the subject. Every one felt that the awful

<p>moment was at hand ; and the assembled

<p>thousands stood uncovered in silent, breathless,

<p>expectation.

</p>
<p>were to pass to expiate their crimes with their
</p>
<p>blood.
</p>
<p>The Ordinary ascended the platform, and at a
</p>
<p>quarter before eight Thistlewood made his ap-
</p>
<p>pearance on the scaffold. His step faultered a
</p>
<p>little as he mounted the platform, and his coun-
</p>
<p>tenance was somewhat flushed and disordered
</p>
<p>on being conducted to the extremity of the drop.
</p>
<p>His deportment was firm, and he looked round at
</p>
<p>the multitude with perfect calmness. He had
</p>
<p>an orange in his hand. On the cap being placed
</p>
<p>on his head, he desired that it might not be put
</p>
<p>over his eyes. While the executioner was
</p>
<p>putting the rope round his neck, a person from
</p>
<p>the top of the houses exclaimed, " Good Al-
</p>
<p>mighty bless you." Thistlewood nodded. The
</p>
<p>Reverend Mr. Cotton, by whom he was pre-
</p>
<p>ceded, endeavoured to obtain his attention ; but
</p>
<p>he shook his head, and said, '' No, no." He
</p>
<p>looked round repeatedly, as expecting to re-
</p>
<p>cognise some one in the crowd, and appeared
</p>
<p>rather disconcerted at observing the distance
</p>
<p>to wliich the populace were removed.
</p>
<p>Some of those to whom the face of Thistlewood
</p>
<p>was not familiar, imagined that he gave proofs
</p>
<p>of the fear of death upon the scaffold, but in this
</p>
<p>supposition tliey were much mistaken. At the
</p>
<p>moment that he has been heard uttering his
</p>
<p>dangerous politics in safety, and declaring his
</p>
<p>determination to stand or fall by them, the ex-
</p>
<p>])ression of his features was the same ; and
</p>
<p>Thistlewood with the rope round his neck was
</p>

<p>spicuous at Smithfield.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cotton approached him while the ex-
</p>
<p>ecutioner was making his awful arrangements,
</p>
<p>and spoke to him upon the subject of his thoughts
</p>
<p>of hereafter. Thistlewood shook his head, and
</p>
<p>said he required no earthly help upon that
</p>
<p>37G C.VrO-STREET CONSPIRyVCY,
</p>
<p>subject. He then sucked his orange, and,
</p>
<p>looking down at the officers who were collected
</p>
<p>about the scaffold, said, in a firm voice, " I have
</p>
<p>but a few moments to live, and I hope the world
</p>
<p>will be convinced that I have been sincere in my
</p>
<p>endeavours, and that I die a friend to liberty.'^
</p>
<p>The figure of the miserable man, which natu-
</p>
<p>rally was not good, had undergone a change for
</p>
<p>the worse : in consequence of the pressure of the
</p>
<p>rope with w^hich his arms were fastened behind,
</p>
<p>his shoulders were raised to a degree that closely
</p>
<p>approached deformity. The executioner having
</p>
<p>placed the cap upon his head, and fastened the
</p>
<p>rope round the beam, looked towards the Sheriff
</p>
<p>as a signal that his duties towards Thistlewood
</p>
<p>were completed.
</p>
<p>While the executioner was performing his last
</p>
<p>offices without to this wretched man, the scene
</p>
<p>within the Lodge was almost beyond the power
</p>
<p>of description. The dreadful obduracy of Brunt
</p>
<p>and Ings filled with horror the small assemblage
</p>
<p>of persons a-mong whom they stood.
</p>
<p>Ings, with a hardihood almost indescribable,
</p>
<p>sucked an orange, witli which Sheriff Parkins had
</p>
<p>provided him, as well as all the other prisoners,
</p>
<p>and sung, or rather screamed, in a discordant
</p>
<p>voice, " Oh! give me death or liberty!" Brunt
</p>
<p>rejoined, " Aye, to be sure. It is better to die
</p>
<p>free, than to live slaves !"
</p>
<p>A gentleman in the Lodge admonished them to
</p>
<p>consider their approaching fate, and to recollect
</p>
<p>the existence of a Deity, into whose supreme
</p>
<p>presence a few minutes would usher them.
</p>
<p>Brunt exclaimed, " I know there is a God I"

</p>
<p>and Ings added, " Yes, to be sure ; and I hope
</p>
<p>he will be more merciful to us than they are here."
</p>
<p>Tidd, who had stood in silence, was now sum-
</p>
<p>moned to the scaffold. lie shook hands with all
</p>
<p>but Davidson, who had separated himself from
</p>
<p>tlic rest.
</p>
<p>THE EXECUTION. 377
</p>
<p>Ings again seized Tidd's hand at the moment
</p>
<p>he was going out, and exclaimed, with a burst of
</p>
<p>laughter, " Give us your hand ! Good-bye !"
</p>
<p>A tear stood in Tidd's eye, and his lips invo-
</p>
<p>luntarily muttered, " My wife and !"
</p>
<p>Ings proceeded  '' Come my old cock-o'-vvax,
</p>
<p>keep up your spirits ; it all will be over soon."'
</p>
<p>Tidd immediately squeezed his hand, and
</p>
<p>ran towards the stairs leading to the scaffold.
</p>
<p>In his hurry, his foot caught the bottom step, and
</p>
<p>he stumbled. He recovered himself, however, in
</p>
<p>an instant, and rushed upon the scaffold, where
</p>
<p>he was immediately received with three cheers
</p>
<p>from the crowd, in which he made a slight effort
</p>
<p>to join.
</p>
<p>The applause vvas evidently occasioned by the
</p>
<p>bold and fearless manner in which the wretched
</p>
<p>man advanced to his station. He turned to the
</p>
<p>crowd who were upon Snow-hill, and bowed to
</p>
<p>them. He then looked down upon the coffins and
</p>
<p>smiled, and turning round to the people who were
</p>
<p>collected in the Old-Bailey towards Ludgate-hill,
</p>
<p>bowed to them. Several voices were again heard,
</p>
<p>and some in the crowd expressed their admira-
</p>
<p>tion of Tidd's conduct.
</p>
<p>The rope having been put round his neck, lie
</p>
<p>told the executioner that the knot would be better
</p>
<p>on the right than on the left side, and that the
</p>
<p>pain of dying might be diminished by the change.
</p>
<p>He then assisted the executioner, and turned
</p>
<p>round his head several times for the purpose of
</p>
<p>fitting the rope to his neck, lie afterwards fami-
</p>
<p>liarly nodded to some one whom he recognised at
</p>
<p>a window, with an air of cheerfulness. He also

<p>desired that the cap might not be put over his
</p>
<p>eyes, but said nothing more. He likwise had an
</p>
<p>orange in his hand, which he continued to suck
</p>
<p>most heartily. He soon became perfectly calm,
</p>
<p>and remained so till the last moment of his life.
</p>
<p>In the interim, Davidson, who had not yet

</p>
<p>come out, leaned with his back against a dresser
</p>
<p>in the lodge, and continued with his hands clasped,
</p>
<p>praying in the most fervent manner, and calling
</p>
<p>with unfeigned and unreserved piety for the inter-
</p>
<p>vention of the Redeemer. Brunt and Ings, how-
</p>
<p>ever, persevered in the same hardihood that they
</p>
<p>had manifested throughout, and continued vent-
</p>
<p>ing their thoughts in unreserved ejaculations.
</p>
<p>A humane individual who stood by remon-
</p>
<p>strated with Brunt again, and besought him to
</p>
<p>ask pardon of God.
</p>
<p>Brunt, with a fierce and savage air, surveyed his
</p>
<p>adviser contemptuously, and exclaimed, " What
</p>
<p>have I done? I have done nothing ! What should
</p>
<p>I ask pardon for ?" The stranger rejoined, ** So
</p>
<p>you say, Brunt; but if you have ever injured any
</p>
<p>man, or done any thing which your conscience
</p>
<p>tells you is wrong, ask pardon of God, penitently
</p>
<p>and sincerely, and you will, I have no doubt,
</p>
<p>obtain mercy."  Brunt replied, " I die with a
</p>
<p>perfectly clear conscience. I have made my
</p>
<p>peace with Gad, and I never injured no man."
</p>
<p>The stranger proceeded, " Believe in the Lord
</p>
<p>Jesus Christ !" Brunt surveyed his humane ad-
</p>
<p>viser again, and muttered, " My mind is made
</p>
<p>up.^'
</p>
<p>" Well done. Brunt !" exclaimed Ings, and was
</p>
<p>again proceeding to sing,
</p>
<p>** Oh give me death or liberty,"
</p>
<p>when he was summoned to the scaffold. lie
</p>
<p>turned to Brunt, and, with a smile on his counte-
</p>
<p>nance, shook hands with him, and prepared to
</p>
<p>go. While the hatch was opening, he exclaimed,
</p>
<p>with a loud voice, " Remember me to King

<p>had some clothes left behind, which he requested

<p>termining, as he said, " that Jack Ketch should
</p>
<p>have no coat of his."
</p>
<p>While he stood on the edge of the steps, at
</p>
<p>the door of the gaol, he said to Davis, one of the
</p>
<p>turnkeys, " Well, Mr. Davis, I am going to find
</p>
<p>out this great secret," and then springing upon
</p>
<p>the scattbld, exclaimed, " Good-bye ! Gentlemen.
</p>
<p>Here goes the remains an unfortunate man."
</p>
<p>He rushed to the platform, upon which he leaped
</p>
<p>and bounded in the most frantic manner. Tiien
</p>
<p>turning himself round towards Smithfield, and
</p>
<p>facing the very coffin that was soon to receive his
</p>
<p>mutilated body, he raised his pinioned hands, in
</p>
<p>the best way he could, and leaning forward with
</p>
<p>savage energy, roared out three distinct cheers to
</p>
<p>the people, in a voice of the most frightful and
</p>
<p>discordant hoarseness. But these unnatural yells
</p>
<p>of desperation, which were evidently nothing but
</p>
<p>the ravings of a disordered mind, or the fcbulli-
</p>
<p>tions of an assumed courage, struck the majority
</p>
<p>of the vast multitude who heard them with
</p>
<p>horror.
</p>
<p>Turning his face towards Ludgate-hill, he bowed,
</p>
<p>and cried out, " This is going to be the last re-
</p>
<p>mains of James Ings," and shouted out part of the
</p>
<p>song in vv'hich the words Death or Libert)/ are in-
</p>
<p>troduced. He laughed upon looking at the coffins,
</p>
<p>and said, turning his back to them, *' I'll turn my
</p>
<p>back upon death!  Is this the gallows they always
</p>
<p>use ? Those coffins are for us, 1 supjiose."
</p>
<p>Tidd, who stood next to him, and had the mo-
</p>
<p>ment before been in conversation with Thistle-
</p>
<p>wood, turned about, and said, " Don't, Ings.

</p>
<p>without making a noise." Ings was silent lor a
</p>
<p>few moments; but as the executioner apju'oached
</p>
<p>him with the rope, he called out, " Do it well 
</p>
<p>pull it tight!"'
</p>
<p>When the executioner threw the rope ronud
</p>
<p>the beam, he said, " Clive inc a better fyll , ih'^
</p>
<p>3 ( 2
</p>
<p>380 C'ATO-STREKT CONSPIIlACr,
</p>
<p>others won't iiave fall enough." When the man
</p>
<p>put him on the cap, Ings said, " I have got a cap
</p>
<p>of my own; put it over this night-cap, and I'll
</p>
<p>thank you." The executioner proceeded to do
</p>
<p>so ; but Ings said, " It will do when we are going
</p>
<p>off: let me see as long as I can." He then
</p>
<p>pushed the cap from his eyes. The others had
</p>
<p>raised the caps from their eyes. " Here I go,
</p>
<p>James Ings !" said he, " and let it be known that
</p>
<p>I die an enemy to all tyrants. Ah ha ! I see a
</p>
<p>good many of my friends are on the houses."
</p>
<p>Again Tidd turned round to Ings, and, as it ap-
</p>
<p>peared, at the suggestion of Thistlewood, re-
</p>
<p>quested that he would not continue the noise.
</p>
<p>Ings laughed and remained silent for a few minutes.
</p>
<p>Mr. Cotton approached Tidd and Ings, but
</p>
<p>they turned away from him. Ings smiled at his
</p>
<p>interference, but Tidd turned round to Thistlewood
</p>
<p>and spoke a few words, in which he seemed to com-
</p>
<p>plain of the inclination of the Ordinary to break
</p>
<p>in upon their last moments.
</p>
<p>Thistlewood now said to Tidd, " We shall soon
</p>
<p>know the last grand secret."
</p>
<p>Brunt, who, after the departure of Ings, stood
</p>
<p>by himself within the porch of the prison, having
</p>
<p>no companion of his ow^n principles to encourage
</p>
<p>him, (as Davidson stood far away from him,) mut-
</p>
<p>tered something about the injustice of his fate.
</p>
<p>The persons around him repeatedly entreated
</p>
<p>him to alter his religious creed, during the last
</p>
<p>few moments left, and to believe in the Sa-
</p>
<p>viour of the world. Still immutable  still har-
</p>
<p>dened in iniquity  he listened not to the remon-
</p>
<p>strances of sincere friends, who besought him.

<p>for his wife's sake, and for the sake of his son, to

<p>step he passed by his former companion in guilt
</p>
<p>to his fate, without noticing him.
</p>
<p>Brunt now appeared considerably irritated.
</p>
<p>" What," he exclaimed, " am I to be the last?
</p>
<p>W hy is this ? They can have my blood but once,
</p>
<p>and why am I to be kept to the last ? But I sup-
</p>
<p>pose they are afraid I should say something to the
</p>
<p>people, because I spoke my mind on the trial.
</p>
<p>However, I don't care."
</p>
<p>Davidson walked up the platform with a firm
</p>
<p>and steady step, but with all that respectful hu-
</p>
<p>mility becoming the condition to which he had
</p>
<p>reduced himself. He bowed to the crowd, and
</p>
<p>instantly joined Mr. Cotton in prayer. He seemed
</p>
<p>inattentive to every thing but the journey he was
</p>
<p>about to take, and his lips moved in prayer until
</p>
<p>he was no longer able to speak. Ho- made no
</p>
<p>request to have his eyes uncovered, but was evi-
</p>
<p>dently preparing himself for bidding an eternal
</p>
<p>adieu to a world of w^hich he had ceased to be
</p>
<p>an inhabitant.
</p>
<p>Brunt was the last summoned to the fatal plat-
</p>
<p>form, and he rushed upon it with impetuosity.
</p>
<p>Some of the people cheered him, which evidently
</p>
<p>gratified and pleased him. It brought a sort of
</p>
<p>grin on his countenance, which remained till his
</p>
<p>death. But his aspect " belied his utterance."
</p>
<p>Externally he appeared to have shrunk more from
</p>
<p>iiis fate than any one of his wretched companions ;
</p>
<p>his cheeks had sunk extremely, giving a degree
</p>
<p>of ghostly prominence to a forehead, cheek-bones,
</p>
<p>and chin, naturally very much protruded, aiul
</p>
<p>his colour was of a livid paleness; but the eyes
</p>
<p>of the man sent forth from their deep recesses

<p>glances of distressing keenness ; his lips were
</p>
<p>firmly compressed together ; not a tear trickled
</p>
<p>down his cheeks; there was no quaking of the
</p>
<p>members. To use an expressive phrase of his
</p>
<p>speech on recoiving- sentence, '' he went through
</p>
<p>With the business.'^ " Wliut," said he, " soldiei? !

<p>What do they do here t I see nothing but a
</p>
<p>mihtary government will do for this country,
</p>
<p>unless there are a good many such as we are. I
</p>
<p>see a good many of my friends round about."
</p>
<p>While the rope was being adjusted, he looked
</p>
<p>towards St. Sepulchre's Church, and perceiving,
</p>
<p>or affecting to perceive, some one with whom he
</p>
<p>had been acquainted, he nodded several times,
</p>
<p>and then made an inclination of the head towards
</p>
<p>the coffins, as if in derision of the awful display.
</p>
<p>His conduct was marked by the same irrational
</p>
<p>levity to the last. When his handkerchief wasr
</p>
<p>taken off, the stifFener fell out, and he kicked it
</p>
<p>away, saying, *' I shan't want you any more."
</p>
<p>His last act was to take a pinch of snuff' from a
</p>
<p>paper which he held in his hand. He stooped to
</p>
<p>put it to his nose, and this he was only able to effect
</p>
<p>by pushing up the night-cap which hung over
</p>
<p>his face. He also threw off his shoes.
</p>
<p>The executioner was now proceeding to adjust
</p>
<p>the ropes, and to pull the caps over the faces of
</p>
<p>the wretched men. A voice irom the crowd again
</p>
<p>called out, ** God bless you. Thistle wood !" This-
</p>
<p>tlewood looked towards the place from which it
</p>
<p>issued, and slightly inclined his head. He then
</p>
<p>said a few words in a whisper to Tidd, and
</p>
<p>awaited his fate in silence.
</p>
<p>Brunt refused altogether to speak with Mr.
</p>
<p>Cotton upon the' subject of the next world,
</p>
<p>and declared that he had done all he thought
</p>
<p>necessary for the place to which he M-as going.
</p>
<p>He appeared disposed to address the crowd, but
</p>
<p>they ^v ere at too great a distance, and the execu-
</p>
<p>ttioner was quick at his work.

</p>
<p>The cap was first drawn over the face of This-
</p>
<p>tlewood, and his cravat was bound over his eyes.
</p>
<p>He stooped gently while the man tied it, and
</p>
<p>appeared to direct him as to the way in which he
</p>
<p>wished it done.
</p>
<p>THE EXECLTIOX. 3S3
</p>
<p>When the executioner came to Inga, the un-
</p>
<p>happy man said, " Now, old gentleman, finish me
</p>
<p>tidily. Tie the handkerchief tight over my eyes.
</p>
<p>Pull the rope tighter ; it may slip."
</p>
<p>When the handkerchief was tied over his eyes,
</p>
<p>he cried out, " I hope, Mr. Cotton, you will give
</p>
<p>me a good character !'' and commenced swinging
</p>
<p>about in his hand an old night-cap in the most
</p>
<p>careless manner.
</p>
<p>Tidd's lips were in motion just before he was
</p>
<p>turned off, as if in prayer. Davidson was in the
</p>
<p>most fervent prayer, and seemed to feel his situa-
</p>
<p>tion with a becoming spirit. He firmly pressed
</p>
<p>the hand of the Rev. Mr. Cotton.
</p>
<p>The executioner having completed the details
</p>
<p>of his awful duty, by placing the criminals in a
</p>
<p>proper situation upon the trap-door, walked down
</p>
<p>the ladder, and left Mr. Cotton alone upon the
</p>
<p>scaffold. The Reverend Gentleman standing
</p>
<p>closer to Davidson than to any of the rest, began
</p>
<p>to read those awful sentences which have sounded
</p>
<p>last in the ears of so many unhappy men. Sud-
</p>
<p>denly the platform fell, and the agonies of death
</p>
<p>were exhibited to the view of the crowd in their
</p>
<p>most terrific form.
</p>
<p>Thistlewood struggled slightly for a few mi-
</p>
<p>nutes, but each effort was more faint than that
</p>
<p>which preceded ; and the body soon turned round
</p>
<p>slowly, as if upon the motion of the hand of
</p>
<p>death.
</p>
<p>Tidd, whose size gave cause to suppose that
</p>
<p>he would " pass" with little comparative pain,
</p>
<p>scarcely moved after the fall. The struggles of
</p>
<p>Ings were great. The assistants of the execu-

<p>tioner pulled his legs with all their might; and
</p>
<p>even then the reluctance of the soul to part from
</p>
<p>its native seat was to be observed in the vehement
</p>
<p>efforts of every part of the body. Davidson, after
</p>
<p>three or four heaves, became motionless ; but
</p>
<p>Brunt suffered extremely, and considerable ex-

</p>
<p>ertions were made by the executioners and others
</p>
<p>to shorten his agonies, by pulling and hanging
</p>
<p>upon his legs. However, in the course of five
</p>
<p>minutes all was still.
</p>
<p>THE DECAPITATION.
</p>
<p>Exactly half an hour after they had been turned
</p>
<p>off, the order was given to cut the bodies down.
</p>
<p>The executioner immediately ascended the scaf-

<p>fold, and drew the legs of the sufferers up, and
</p>
<p>placed the dead men, who were still suspended,
</p>
<p>in a sitting position, with their feet towards Lud-
</p>
<p>gate-hill. This being done, the trap-door was
</p>
<p>again put up, and the platform restored to its ori-
</p>
<p>ginal state. The executioner proceeded to cut
</p>
<p>Thistlewood down ; and, with the aid of an
</p>
<p>assistant, lifted the body into the first coftin,
</p>
<p>laying it on the back, and placing the head over
</p>
<p>the end of the coffin, so as to bring the neck on
</p>
<p>the edge of the block. The rope was then drawn
</p>
<p>from the neck, and the cap was removed from the
</p>
<p>face.
</p>
<p>The last convulsions of expiring life had thrown
</p>
<p>a purple hue over the countenance, which gave it
</p>
<p>a most ghastly and appalling appearance ; but no
</p>
<p>violent distortion of feature had taken place. An
</p>
<p>axe was placed on the scaffold, but this was not
</p>
<p>used.
</p>
<p>When the rope had been removed, and the coat
</p>
<p>and waistcoat forced down, so as to leave the neck
</p>
<p>exposed, a person wearing a black mask, which
</p>
<p>extended to his mouth, over which a coloured
</p>
<p>handkerchief was tied, and his hat slouched down,
</p>
<p>so as to conceal part of the mask, and attired in a

<p>vancing to the coffin, proceeded to sever the head
</p>
<p>from the body.
</p>
<p>When the crowd perceived the knife applied to
</p>
<p>the throat of Thistlewood, they raised a shout, in
</p>
<p>which exclamations of horror and of reproach
</p>
<p>were mingled. The tumult seemed to disconcert
</p>
<p>the person in the mask for the moment ; but, upon
</p>
<p>the whole, he performed the operation with dex-
</p>
<p>terity; and, having handed the head to the
</p>
<p>assistant executioner, who waited to receive it,
</p>
<p>he immediately retired, pursued by the hootings
</p>
<p>of the mob.
</p>
<p>The assistant executioner, holding the head by
</p>
<p>the hair over the forehead, exhibited it from
</p>
<p>the side of the scaffold nearest Newgate-street.
</p>
<p>A person attended on the scaffold, who dic-
</p>
<p>tated to the executioner what he was to say;
</p>
<p>and he exclaimed with a loud voice  " This is
</p>
<p>the head of Arthur Thistlewood, the traitor !" A
</p>
<p>thrilling sensation was produced on the specta-
</p>
<p>tors by the display of this ghastly object, and the
</p>
<p>hissings and hootings of part of the mob were
</p>
<p>vehemently renewed.
</p>
<p>The same ceremony was repeated hi front of
</p>
<p>the scaffold, and on the side nearest Ludgate-
</p>
<p>street. The head was then placed at the foot of
</p>
<p>the coffin ; while the body, before lifted up to
</p>
<p>bring the neck on the block, was forced lower
</p>
<p>down, and, this done, the head was again put in
</p>
<p>its proper ])lace, at the upper end of the coffin,
</p>
<p>which was left open.
</p>
<p>The block was then moved by the hangman,
</p>
<p>and placed at the head of the second coffin. The
</p>
<p>cap and rope were removed from the face and

<p>neck of Tidd. The same livid hue which over-
</p>
<p>spread the countenance of Thistlewood was per-
</p>
<p>ce})tible.
</p>
<p>The coat and waistcoat being pulled down, the
</p>
<p>masked executioner agam came forward. He
</p>
<p>was received with groans, and cries of " bhoot

</p>
<p>that murderer ;" ** Bring out Edwards," ^c.
</p>
<p>He seemed less disconcerted than at first, and
</p>
<p>performed the operation with great expedition,
</p>
<p>and, having handed the head to the person who had
</p>
<p>before received that of Thistlewood, he retired
</p>
<p>amidst yells and execrations.
</p>
<p>The assistant executioner then advanced to the
</p>
<p>side of the scaffold, from which the former head
</p>
<p>was first exhibited, holding the head between
</p>
<p>both hands by the cheeks, the forehead of Tidd
</p>
<p>being bald, and exclaiming, " This is the head
</p>
<p>of Richard Tidd, the traitor." The same words
</p>
<p>were also repeated from the other two sides of
</p>
<p>the scaffold, and the head was then deposited with
</p>
<p>the body in the second coffin.
</p>
<p>The block was now removed to the third coffin,
</p>
<p>and the body of Ings, being cut down, was placed
</p>
<p>in it with the face upwards. The person in the
</p>
<p>mask again came forward, severed the head from
</p>
<p>the body, and retired amidst the hootings of the
</p>
<p>crowd. The assistant-executioner proceeded to
</p>
<p>exhibit the head, holding it up by the hair in the
</p>
<p>same way as he had Thistlewood's, from the three
</p>
<p>sides of the scaffold, exclaiming, ** This is the head
</p>
<p>of James Ing&, the traitor." The head was then
</p>
<p>placed in the coffin.
</p>
<p>The block being removed to the fourth coffin,
</p>
<p>the body of Davidson was taken down from the
</p>
<p>gallows, the noose taken from about the neck,
</p>
<p>and the cap removed from the face, which re-
</p>
<p>mained in death exactly what it had been while
</p>
<p>living. The mouth was a little open, but no
</p>
<p>expression of agony, or change of colour, could
</p>
<p>be remarked. The body was placed in the fourth

<p>coffin, and the man in the mask having performed
</p>
<p>his part, the head was exhibited in the same way
</p>
<p>as the last, with the exclamation, " This is the
</p>
<p>head of William Davidson, the traitor."
</p>
<p>Little or no blood had fallen from the other
</p>
<p>heads, but from this it fell profusely. The hisises

</p>
<p>and groans of the crowd were repeated on this
</p>
<p>occasion, while the head was deposited in the
</p>
<p>coffin which contained the sufferer's body.
</p>
<p>The executioner and his assistant now pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to cut down the last of the sufferers.
</p>
<p>Brunt. The block was placed at the head of the
</p>
<p>fifth coffin. The blood which had stained the
</p>
<p>block was wiped off with the saw-dust, and, the
</p>
<p>rope being cut, they attempted to lift the body to
</p>
<p>the place where the last part of the sentence was
</p>
<p>to be executed, when it was found that in putting
</p>
<p>up the platform part of his clothing had been shut
</p>
<p>in with it, and held him so tight, that a consider-
</p>
<p>able effort was necessary to disengage the remains
</p>
<p>of the wretched culprit. He was placed in the
</p>
<p>fifth coffin.
</p>
<p>His miserable and cadaverous countenance pre-
</p>
<p>sented but a ghastly spectacle while he was alive ;
</p>
<p>but dead, its aspect was little less than terrific ;
</p>
<p>and the dark hair which overhung his forehead
</p>
<p>came in frightful contrast with the purple hue
</p>
<p>produced by the agonies of death.
</p>
<p>The masked executioner, while performing his
</p>
<p>duty, happened to let the head fall from his hands
</p>
<p>on the saw-bust. The bowlings and groans of the
</p>
<p>spectators were again heard at that moment, and
</p>
<p>amidst these the operator retired, having first
</p>
<p>handed the discoloured " trunkless ball" to the
</p>
<p>assistant executioner, who advancing, as in each
</p>
<p>of the other cases, first tQ the side of the scaffold
</p>
<p>nearest Giltspur-street, then to the front, and lastly
</p>
<p>to the side looking towards the Felons'-door, pro-
</p>
<p>claimed aloud, " This is the head of John Tho-
</p>
<p>mas Brunt, the traitor.'' His head was then

</p>
<p>placed in the coffin, and thus terminated this part
</p>
<p>of the awful business of that memorable day.
</p>
<p>The execution occupied an hour and eight
</p>
<p>minutes. It was a quarter before eight when
</p>
<p>Thistlewood walked up the steps leading to the
</p>
<p>3D2

<p>388 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>fatal platform; and it wanted seven minutes to
</p>
<p>nine when the head of Brunt was placed in the
</p>
<p>coffin.
</p>
<p>From the manner in which the last part of the
</p>
<p>execution was performed very little blood was
</p>
<p>seen on the scaffold. The bodies being placed
</p>
<p>almost in a sitting attitude in their coffins, the
</p>
<p>blood could not flow copiously from them at the
</p>
<p>moment the heads were taken off. It was not
</p>
<p>till they were laid in a horizontal position that the
</p>
<p>vital stream could escape freely from the heart.
</p>
<p>The person who wore the mask, and who per-
</p>
<p>formed the ceremony of decapitation, is said to be
</p>
<p>the same person who beheaded Despard and his
</p>
<p>associates. This, however, may be doubted, as,
</p>
<p>from the quickness and spring of his motions, he
</p>
<p>seemed to be a young man. His mode of opera-
</p>
<p>tion showed evidently that he was a surgeon. In
</p>
<p>performing his dreadful duty, the edge of the first
</p>
<p>knife was turned by the vertebrae of Thistlewood,
</p>
<p>and two others became necessary to enable him
</p>
<p>to finish his heart-appalling task.
</p>
<p>The coffins containing the remains of the suf-
</p>
<p>ferers were left on the scaffold but for a few
</p>
<p>minutes after the sentence of the law had been
</p>
<p>carried into effect. While there they continued
</p>
<p>open. At nine o'clock they were conveyed into
</p>
<p>the prison by the Debtors'-door, and this dread-
</p>
<p>ful scene being thus ended, the crowd began peace-
</p>
<p>ably to separate.
</p>
<p>In such an immense assemblage, as might be
</p>
<p>expected, some accidents occurred through the
</p>
<p>dreadful pressure of the crowd. Some women
</p>
<p>(and it is painful to record that many women were

<p>among the crowd) were brought out famting, and
</p>
<p>a boy was severely hurt by the falling of a part of
</p>
<p>the railing in front of St. Scpulclire's church. The
</p>
<p>persons whose weight brought down the railing
</p>
<p>from the stone base in which it was planted, were

</p>
<p>thrown on the shoulders of those beneath them,
</p>
<p>and caused great confusion at the moment, but
</p>
<p>no more serious accidents occurred than the
</p>
<p>injury received by the boy above-mentioned.
</p>
<p>In addition to the military arrangements on this
</p>
<p>awful occasion, which we have incidentally men-
</p>
<p>tioned, it was thought necessary to adopt the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing precautionary measures, that should any
</p>
<p>thing like a breach of the peace be attempted, it
</p>
<p>might be crushed in its infancy ; and it is a pleas-
</p>
<p>ing part of our duty here to record the prudence
</p>
<p>which gave rise to these measures, the very ex-
</p>
<p>cellent and effectual manner in which they were
</p>
<p>carried into execution, and, above all, the exem-
</p>
<p>plary conduct of the soldiers who were on duty
</p>
<p>throughout the morning, although they were at
</p>
<p>times severely, and indeed unavoidably pressed
</p>
<p>upon by the crowd. The Life Guards were inces-
</p>
<p>santly attentive to prevent their horses from
</p>
<p>doing any injury, while occasionally driven out of
</p>
<p>their position by the momentary agitation of the
</p>
<p>persons immediately near them.
</p>
<p>At a very early hour, the neighbourhood of
</p>
<p>Blackfriars-bridge, being the place appointed for
</p>
<p>the rendezvous of a considerablt number of troops,
</p>
<p>presented a very novel spectacle. At five o'clock
</p>
<p>in the morning, six light field-pieces of flying-
</p>
<p>artillery arrived in front of the livery stables,
</p>
<p>near Christ Church, escorted by the usual com-
</p>
<p>plement of men. They drew up in the centre of
</p>
<p>the street, and remained there until after the exe-
</p>
<p>cution took place.
</p>
<p>At a still earlier hour, three troops of the Life
</p>
<p>Guards arrived in the neighbourhood of Newgate ;

</p>
<p>one troop and a picquet remained near the scaf-
</p>
<p>fold ; another picquet was stationed in Ludgate-
</p>
<p>liill, facing the Old Bailey; and the remaining troop
</p>
<p>drew up in Bridge-street.
</p>
<p>The moment the prisoners were about to be
</p>
<p>390 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>brought out to the scaffold, an officer rode from
</p>
<p>his station in front of Newgate, communicated
</p>
<p>with the picquet on Ludgate-hill, and then rode on
</p>
<p>to the troop in Bridge-street, to whom he imme-
</p>
<p>diately gave the word of command to advance.
</p>
<p>The troop instantly followed the officer, and pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded onwards until they joined the picquet on
</p>
<p>Ludgate-hill, with which they halted, and formed
</p>
<p>in a line, still facing the Old Bailey.
</p>
<p>The flying artillery, near Christ Church, also
</p>
<p>made a movement in advance just at the same
</p>
<p>time, and formed a crescent across the road ; the
</p>
<p>guns pointing towards the bridge.
</p>
<p>The City Light Horse were under arms, in their
</p>
<p>barracks in Gray*s-Inn-lane, and a number of
</p>
<p>troops were stationed at various depots, assigned
</p>
<p>them at convenient intervals throughout the
</p>
<p>metropolis.
</p>
<p>A little before ten, the multitude having com-
</p>
<p>pletely dispersed, the detachments marched off to
</p>
<p>their respective barracks.
</p>
<p>DISPOSAL OF THE BODIES.
</p>
<p>On the day of execution the friends of tiie
</p>
<p>families of the unfortunate men who were executed
</p>
<p>met at a public-house, and after some discussion
</p>
<p>upon the subject of raising a subscription for the
</p>
<p>wives and children of those who were transported,
</p>
<p>as well as of those who were hanged, adopted a
</p>
<p>resolution to apply through Lord Sidmouth for
</p>
<p>leave to take av/ay the bodies of the deceased
</p>
<p>from Newgate.
</p>
<p>The following petition was accordingly drawn
</p>
<p>up, in t]\c names of the widows of the wretched
</p>
<p>criminals, and forwarded to Lord Sidmouth, to

<p>DISPOSAL OF THE BODIES. 391
</p>
<p>To His Most Gracious Majety the King.
</p>
<p>' "Sire,
</p>
<p>" The Petition of Susan Thistlewood, Mary Tidd,
</p>
<p>Mary Brunt, Celia Ings, and Sarah Davidson, humbly
</p>
<p>sheweth, That your Petitioners are the widows of the unfor-
</p>
<p>tunate men who this morning sufl'ered the dreadful sentence
</p>
<p>of the law at the Old Bailey.
</p>
<p>" Your petitioners most earnestly entreat your Majesty
</p>
<p>to grant them one consolation, by restoring to them the
</p>
<p>mangled remains of their late unfortunate husbands, that
</p>
<p>they, your petitioners, may shed a silent tear over their mu-
</p>
<p>tilated remains, ere they are consigned to the tomb.
</p>
<p>" We are confident that all desire of further vengeance
</p>
<p>has ceased, and that your Majesty will be graciously pleased
</p>
<p>to order the restoration of the bodies to your humble Peti-
</p>
<p>tioners, that they may have them decently interred ; and
</p>
<p>your Petitioners will, as in duty bound, for ever pray, 8^'C.

</p>
<p>'' MARY TIDD,
</p>
<p>" MARY BRUNT,
</p>
<p>"CELL\ INGS,
</p>
<p>" SARAH DAVIDSON."
</p>
<p>The petition was accompanied by a request to
</p>
<p>his Lordship that the bodies might be given up to
</p>
<p>the friends of the deceased, and stating, that the
</p>
<p>object was the humane one of raising the means
</p>
<p>of support for the wives and children by a public
</p>
<p>exhibition.
</p>
<p>It is almost unnecessary to state that Lord
</p>
<p>Sidmouth did not hesitate to refuse the request, a
</p>
<p>compliance with which would be attended with
</p>
<p>great inconvenience at least. His lordship stated,
</p>
<p>in the mildest terms, the impossibility of granting

</p>
<p>it, contrary as such compliance would be to esta-
</p>
<p>blished usage.
</p>
<p>At a late hour in the evening, the wives of the
</p>
<p>executed men were informed by the keeper of
</p>
<p>392 CATO-STREET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>Newgate, that the bodies of their husbands were
</p>
<p>buried.
</p>
<p>In the course of the afternoon a channel had
</p>
<p>been dug alongside of the subterraneous passage
</p>
<p>that leads to the cells, and, about seven in the
</p>
<p>evening, after the coffins had been filled with
</p>
<p>quick lime, they were strongly screwed up, placed
</p>
<p>in a line with each other, strewed over with earth,
</p>
<p>and finally covered with stones, and of course no
</p>
<p>trace of their end remains for any future public
</p>
<p>observation. On this circumstance being com-
</p>
<p>municated to their unhappy wives, they were
</p>
<p>entirely overcome by the poignancy of their
</p>
<p>feelings.
</p>
<p>On the following morning an individual petition
</p>
<p>was forwarded to the Privy-Council on the part
</p>
<p>of Mrs, Thistlewood, and was presented to his
</p>
<p>Majesty, for the body of her husband. A laconic
</p>
<p>answer was ahnost immediately returned, " That

<p>Tran)>voitation of the respited Traitors, Discharge of
</p>
<p>the suspected Persons, ^c.
</p>
<p>Very early in the morning of Tuesday, the 2d
</p>
<p>of May, the day following the execution of their
</p>
<p>partners in crime, tive of the respited traitors,
</p>
<p>namely, Wilson, Harrison, Cooper, Strange, and
</p>
<p>Bradburn, were removed irom Newgate in three
</p>
<p>post-chaises, and conveyed under a proper escort
</p>
<p>to Portsmouth, where they were put on board a
</p>
<p>convict-ship, which soon after sailed for New
</p>
<p>South Wales.
</p>
<p>Gilchrist was still detained in Newgate, but it
</p>
<p>\vas expected his confinement would not be of long
</p>
<p>duration ; the peculiar circumstances of his case
</p>
<p>having excited a feeling of mercy towards him.
</p>
<p>On Saturday the 6th of May, the following
</p>
<p>persons, whose arrests on suspicion we have
</p>
<p>previously mentioned, were placed at the bar of
</p>
<p>the Old Bailey, previous to the adjournment of the
</p>
<p>court, viz. Thomas Preston, William Simmons,
</p>
<p>Abel Hall, Robert George, William Firth, and
</p>
<p>William Hazard. The prisoners being addressed
</p>
<p>by order of the court, and informed that, as no
</p>
<p>prosecutors appeared against them, they were
</p>
<p>discharged, bowed respectfully, and departed, with
</p>
<p>the exception of Preston, who made an attempt
</p>
<p>to address the Court, but was immediately silenced.
</p>
<p>We have now completed, as far as the indivi-
</p>
<p>duals arrested were concerned, our narration of
</p>
<p>the w^hole of the proceedings relative to the
</p>
<p>horrid conspiracy, which at one time threatened
</p>
<p>such awful consequences ; but as many circum-
</p>

<p>The infamous Spy and instigator, George

<p>Edwards, has also been frequently named as
</p>
<p>playing a very prominent part in this horrid

<p>drama, and, independent of the disclosures of his

<p>criminal conduct, incidentally made in the course

<p>of the judicial proceedings against the conspirators,
</p>
<p>the answers given by Thistlewood ta the questions
</p>
<p>put to him by Mr. Alderman Wood, on the

<p>morning of the fatal first of May, imparted a
</p>
<p>certain degree of interest to every circumstance

<p>connected with that vile character, and a feeling
</p>
<p>of indignation, horror, and disgust, was excited in
</p>
<p>the public mind relative to this consummate villain,
</p>
<p>which had never been equalled but in the sensation
</p>
<p>caused by the first discovery of the plot itself.
</p>
<p>Consonant with these feelings were the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings instituted by Mr. Alderman Wood, both

<p>in and out of Parliament, for the apprehension

<p>stop not to inquire whether the protection from

<p>the consequences of his crimes, experienced by
</p>
<p>this fellow, be justifiable, or otherwise, we shall
</p>
<p>certainly be rendering an acceptable service to
</p>
<p>society and to future generations, in tracing this
</p>
<p>serpent through all his intricate paths of villany,
</p>
<p>and cautioning the thoughtless and unsuspecting
</p>
<p>from becoming the dupes of similar villains, (if
</p>
<p>any such exist) in their intemperate moments of
</p>
<p>political animosity.

<p>ARTHUR THISTLEWOOD.
</p>
<p>In' page 70, of the preceding narrative, we have
</p>
<p>briefly touched on the history of this ill-fated man,
</p>
<p>and we now add some further particulars relating
</p>
<p>to him.
</p>
<p>Very early in life he manifested idle and un-
</p>
<p>settled habits, and remained a burden on his family
</p>
<p>until the period of his obtaining a commission in
</p>
<p>the Militia, soon after which he married a young
</p>
<p>lady of property ; but even that step, so promising
</p>
<p>in the outset, was pregnant with future troubles.
</p>
<p>Thistlewood had supposed her fortune to be at
</p>
<p>her own disposal, but it was in fact so settled,
</p>
<p>that she received the interest only during her
</p>
<p>life, and the principal, at her death, reverted to
</p>
<p>her relations. Sixteen months after their mar-
</p>
<p>riage, she died in child-bed, and Thistlewood was
</p>
<p>left almost without a shilling of her property.
</p>
<p>In London he formed an acquaintance with a
</p>
<p>number of young military officers ; was introduced

</p>
<p>into all the vices and dissipation of the metropohs,
</p>
<p>and gave loose to his passion for intrigue and
</p>
<p>gaming. On one night he was filched by a noto-
</p>
<p>rious black leg, and some of his companions, at
</p>
<p>one of the Hells, in the neighbourhood of St.
</p>
<p>James's, of upwards of 2,000/. His money being
</p>
<p>nearly all gone, he fled in despair. Legal pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings were commenced to recover the amount ;
</p>
<p>but, owing to some informality in the pleadings,
</p>
<p>it was not recovered ; and, soon after, those who
</p>
<p>had pigeoned him left the kingdom.
</p>
<p>In France his evil genius still followed him ; on
</p>
<p>one occasion, having an improper passport, he
</p>
<p>was detained by the police, and during his deten-
</p>
<p>tion, a circunfistance occurred which produced him
</p>
<p>a long period of confinement. He had always ex-
</p>
<p>pressed himself a hater of oppression and injustice.
</p>
<p>An Englishman, named Heely, was arrested for
</p>
<p>being without a passport, and conveyed to the
</p>
<p>same prison where Thistlewood was confined.
</p>
<p>Upon Thistlewood and Heely receiving orders
</p>
<p>from Paris for their liberation, Heely used some
</p>
<p>insulting language to the officer who brought him
</p>
<p>to prison ; the officer struck him with a cane, and
</p>
<p>Thistlewood knocked the officer down with his
</p>
<p>clenched fist.
</p>
<p>In consequence of this outrage, they were
</p>
<p>thrown into close confinement, and lay there for
</p>
<p>several weeks before they were able to obtain
</p>
<p>their final liberation.
</p>
<p>Thistlewood having obtained a passport, then
</p>
<p>went to Paris, having sufficient knowledge of the
</p>
<p>French language to be able to converse. He
</p>
<p>entered the French service, and was present

<p>during the perpetration of numberless atrocities
</p>
<p>by the French troops.
</p>
<p>Although a man of but middling talent, he had
</p>
<p>a considerable knowledge of military tactics ;
</p>
<p>ARTHUR THISTLEWOOD. 307
</p>
<p>was an excellent swordsman, and always fearless
</p>
<p>of death.
</p>
<p>He entered a regiment of French grenadiers,
</p>
<p>and was at the battle of Zurich, commanded by
</p>
<p>General
</p>
<p>After a variety of adventures in France and on
</p>
<p>different parts of the Continent, he returned to
</p>
<p>England, and became possessed of a considerable
</p>
<p>estate, by the death of a relation ; which he sub-
</p>
<p>sequently sold to a gentleman at Durham for
</p>
<p>10,000/.
</p>
<p>He felt inclined to settle himself, and courted
</p>
<p>Miss ^yilkinson of Ilorncastle. The gentleman to
</p>
<p>whom he sold his estate, instead of paying him
</p>
<p>the money, gave him an annuity bond, agreeing to
</p>
<p>pay him 850/. per annum for a number of lives
</p>
<p>In eighteen months this purchaser became a bank-
</p>
<p>rupt, and Thistlewood was again reduced, not to
</p>
<p>want or poverty, but his finances were at a low
</p>
<p>ebb.
</p>
<p>Thistlewood's father and brother, both of whom
</p>
<p>now reside and are most respectable farmers in
</p>
<p>the neighbourhood of Horncastle, assisted him to
</p>
<p>take a farm ; he continued to occupy it till he
</p>
<p>found he was losing annually a considerable sum,
</p>
<p>in consequence of the high rent and taxes, and
</p>
<p>farming produce being very low ; he then parted
</p>
<p>with it. He came with his present wife and son
</p>
<p>to London, and formed an acquaintance with the
</p>
<p>Spenceans.
</p>
<p>The Evanses were his constant companions ; he
</p>
<p>took young Evans to France, paying all ex[)enses
</p>
<p>for near twelve months ; and since his return hiS'
</p>
<p>history is but too well recorded in the annals of

<p>The son who took an affecting leave of him in

<p>The following lines are said to have been written
</p>
<p>by him while under sentence of death in New-

<p>RICHARD TIDD
</p>
<p>Was born at Grantham, in Lincolnshire. Hit,
</p>
<p>age at the time of his execution was forty-five.
</p>
<p>He was apprenticed to Mr. Cante, of Grantham,
</p>
<p>but quitted his situation at sixteen years of age.
</p>
<p>He then went to Nottingham, where he lived two
</p>
<p>years and a half ; from thence he came to London,
</p>
<p>where he resided several years. He thought it
</p>
<p>prudent to retreat into Scotland in 1803, and he
</p>
<p>stopped there for five years.
</p>
<p>This flight was made in consequence of his
</p>
<p>having voted for Sir Francis Burdett, at the
</p>
<p>Middlesex election, when the Honourable Baronet
</p>
<p>was opposed by Mr. Mainwaring. Tidd swore
</p>
<p>that he was a freeholder  the fact being other-
</p>
<p>wise, and fled to avoid prosecution for perjury.
</p>
<p>A reward of 100/. was offered for his appre-
</p>
<p>hension.
</p>
<p>On his return from the north, he went to live
</p>
<p>at Rochester, and for nine years worked at his
</p>
<p>trade of shoemaker in that town. He was en-
</p>
<p>gaged in the conspiracy for which Colonel
</p>
<p>Despard suffered; but a temporary absence
</p>
<p>from town preserved him from sharing the same

</p>
<p>fate.
</p>
<p>RICHARD TIDD. 399
</p>
<p>His last stay in town commenced on the 10th
</p>
<p>of March, 1818. From that time he attended all
</p>
<p>Mr. Hunt's meetings, public and private, and was
</p>
<p>present at all the subsequent Radical meetings.
</p>
<p>He was introduced to Edwards by Brunt, at his
</p>
<p>own residence, Hole-in-the-Wall Passage, Bald-
</p>
<p>win's-gardens. Edwards's assumed violence suit-
</p>
<p>ed his disposition, and he eagerly closed with
</p>
<p>every proposition, however desperate.
</p>
<p>It was a most extraordinary circumstance that
</p>
<p>he had constantly an impression on his mind, for
</p>
<p>the last twenty years, that he was to be hanged.
</p>
<p>He frequently expressed to his wife that he
</p>
<p>should die on the orallows, who felt distressed at
</p>
<p>his entertaining such an idea, but he would still
</p>
<p>persist that such would be his fate. He was un-
</p>
<p>happily too good a prophet, and thus a life of
</p>
<p>irregularity terminated in the most ignominous
</p>
<p>manner.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Tidd is a very decent woman ; Tidd
</p>
<p>has left a brother and one daughter to deplore his
</p>
<p>late.
</p>
<p>Tidd, during the war, enlisted into more than
</p>
<p>half of the regiments under the crown, and re-
</p>
<p>ceived the different bounties. It is astonishing
</p>
<p>how he escaped detection ; he was always in
</p>
<p>disgui.se when he enlisted, and, as soon as he had
</p>
<p>obtained the bounty, he deserted. When he
</p>
<p>had spent the money, he enlisted into another
</p>
<p>regiment.
</p>
<p>It will be evident from this account, that the
</p>
<p>statements of his uniform good character and
</p>
<p>conduct published at the period of his first
</p>
<p>arrest, for the crime of which he was ultimately

<p>his countrymen, were put forth by some zealous

<p>400 CATO-STRKKT CONSPIHACY
</p>
<p>JAMES INGS
</p>
<p>Was a native of Hampshire. His relations were
</p>
<p>respectable tradesmen. He has left a wife and
</p>
<p>four children. Ings was a butcher at Portsmouth,
</p>
<p>and at the time of his marriage had a handsome
</p>
<p>property, consisting of several houses, and some
</p>
<p>money in the funds.
</p>
<p>Trade growing bad at the termination of the
</p>
<p>war, and his property having decreased, some of
</p>
<p>his tenements were sold, and he came up to
</p>
<p>London about eighteen months ago, with a little
</p>
<p>ready money, produced by the sale of a house,
</p>
<p>and opened a butcher's-shop at the west-end of
</p>
<p>the town. He could, however, get no business^
</p>
<p>and in a few months gave up the shop, and, with
</p>
<p>a few pounds he had left, he opened a coffee-shop
</p>
<p>in Whitechapel.
</p>
<p>Business becoming dull there, he was involved
</p>
<p>in great distress, and at last was compelled to
</p>
<p>pawn his watch to enable him to send his wife
</p>
<p>and children down to Portsmouth to her friends,
</p>
<p>to prevent their starving in London.
</p>
<p>At the coffee-house in Whitechapel he sold, be-
</p>
<p>sides coffee, political pamphlets, with which he
</p>
<p>was supplied by Carlile, of Fleet-street. Having
</p>
<p>given up the shop,; and finding that there was
</p>
<p>no prospect of supporting himself and his fa-
</p>
<p>mily with credit, he gave himself up to despair.
</p>
<p>He had read the different Deistical publications
</p>
<p>during the time he sold political pamphlets, and,
</p>
<p>from being a churchman, he became a confirmed
</p>
<p>Deist.
</p>
<p>He was a most affectionate husband and father;
</p>
<p>and his desperate situation, no doubt, was a prin-

</p>
<p>cipal cause of his joining the Cato-street plot.
</p>
<p>Edwards, Adams, Thistlewood, and Brunt, had
</p>
<p>frequently visited Ings during the time he kc^pt
</p>
<p>I AMES IVGS. 401
</p>
<p>ilie colibc and political-pamphlet shop, and when
</p>
<p>he was in more desperate circumstances, he be-
</p>
<p>came a fitter companion for persons engaged in
</p>
<p>such an atrocious crime as the one for which he
</p>
<p>suffered the sentence of the law.
</p>
<p>For some weeks before the Cato-street disco-
</p>
<p>very, Ings was in the utmost distress, quite penny-
</p>
<p>less, and the money he was supplied with to sub-
</p>
<p>sist upon was given him by George Edwards.
</p>
<p>Ings was also supplied with money by the same
</p>
<p>person to take an apartment, where arms and am-
</p>
<p>munition could be safely placed. He took a room
</p>
<p>in the house where Brunt lodged, and thither the
</p>
<p>greater part of the ammunition and arms was
</p>
<p>conveyed by Edwards, Adams, and himself; in-
</p>
<p>deed, it was the depot of the conspirators.
</p>
<p>The following Letters were written by Ings in
</p>
<p>Newgate, the night before his execution :

<p>404 CATO-bTliEET CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>THE HUMBLE PETITION OF JAMES INGS,
</p>
<p>TO THE KING.
</p>
<p>I was born near Waltham, in Hampshire, but I
</p>
<p>have lived ever since I was about fifteen years of
</p>
<p>age at Portsea, and every one that knows me knew
</p>
<p>no harm of me ; and the masters that I have lived
</p>
<p>with sent me a character for me to give to the
</p>
<p>Jury, but the Jury never saw the character.
</p>
<p>I married a girl that I loved, and she had a
</p>
<p>little property, and I continued working till I
</p>
<p>could get nothing to do, and I went into business,
</p>
<p>and it turned out very unfortunately, and I lost a
</p>
<p>great deal of money, not through drinking and
</p>
<p>gambling, for I never went to a public-house in
</p>
<p>my life but to smoke my pipe, or for the sake of
</p>
<p>company. I can assure your most gracious Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty, that I never was tipsey but three times in
</p>
<p>my life, and that was not through the love of liquor.
</p>
<p>The times being so very bad at Portsea, and
</p>
<p>I had nothing to do, me and my wife made
</p>
<p>up our minds to come to London: me and my
</p>
<p>family left Portsea the beginning of May 1819.
</p>
<p>I thought when I came to town I should get a
</p>
<p>situation, but to my sad disappointment 1 soon
</p>
<p>found all my hopes was blasted, I tried every
</p>
<p>means I was master of to get employ for the sup-
</p>
<p>port my family : I did not know how to act, for
</p>
<p>it was not my intention when I came to town to
</p>
<p>enter into business, I had a little money by me,
</p>
<p>for me and my wife mortgaged her property 
</p>
<p>a house I mean  to the full value of it, if it was
</p>
<p>to be sold now.
</p>
<p>I went and took a batcher's shop in Baker's-
</p>
<p>row, Whitechapel-road, and I carried on business

<p>from Midsumm.er to Michaelmas. When 1 came
</p>
<p>to look over my little stock of money, I found it
</p>
<p>was very much reduced, and the summer being
</p>
<p>so very hot, was verv miu'h ;iL^ainst me ; ;uul after
</p>
<p>PETITION OF INGS. 405
</p>
<p>1 had paid my rent, and a few little bills beside,
</p>
<p>my money was nearly all gone.
</p>
<p>I left Baker's-ro'w at Michaelmas, and I took
</p>
<p>a house in Old Montague-street, Brick-lai>e, and I
</p>
<p>fitted it up for a coffee-house, and then my money-
</p>
<p>was gone. It did not turn out to my expectation,
</p>
<p>for I did not take money enough, if it had been
</p>
<p>all profit, to keep my family. I persuaded my
</p>
<p>wife to return to Portsea with the children : the
</p>
<p>reason was, I thought she had better be among
</p>
<p>her friends without money than in London.
</p>
<p>I remained in the house a short time after my
</p>
<p>wife had left me : there was a man used to come
</p>
<p>frequently and take a cup of coffee, and he used
</p>
<p>to enter into conversation about the Manchester
</p>
<p>massacre, and Government, ^c. I did not make
</p>
<p>but very little reply, for 1 took him to be some
</p>
<p>officer.
</p>
<p>After I had left my house, I met him in Smith-
</p>
<p>ficld-market ; he said 1 have caught you out, I shall
</p>
<p>make you stand treat. I am sorry it is not in my
</p>
<p>power, for I am very short at present ; if I do not
</p>
<p>get some work very shortly, 1 must sell my few
</p>
<p>things. What have you to sell ? A sofa-bedstead
</p>
<p> it is the best piece of furniture I have. I should
</p>
<p>like to see it ; if I like it I will buy it, and give
</p>
<p>you as much as any person will. I took him to
</p>
<p>my lodging, No. 20, Primrose-street, Bishopsgate,
</p>
<p>and shewed him my sofa, but it did not suit him,
</p>
<p>and he took me to a friend of his, a broker, to buy
</p>
<p>my sofa, but it did not suit him, and we parted
</p>
<p>early in January.
</p>
<p>I met him in Fleet-market, and he asked me
</p>
<p>how I did ? 1 told him I was very low in spirits :

<p>come, he says, have a glass of gin  that will rise
</p>
<p>your spirits. No, I thank you, I never drink so
</p>
<p>soon in the morning. Wc walked uj) Fleet-street,
</p>
<p>and wo went and bought the very sword that was
</p>
<p>]irodurcil in the Court, and I took it to the culler's,
</p>
<p>and 1 left my nan;e.

</p>
<p>If I had known at that time what was going to
</p>
<p>be done, I am sure I should not have left my
</p>
<p>name. He took me to the White Hart, and gave
</p>
<p>mc beef-steaks, ^c. for my dinner, and I thought
</p>
<p>lie was the best friend I had, for he used to give
</p>
<p>uie victuals and drink when I was very short ;
</p>
<p>and this was Edwards that introduced me to tjie
</p>
<p>party, which I never should have known if it liad
</p>
<p>not been for him.
</p>
<p>There have been a great deal more said about
</p>
<p>me in the Court than is true, but it is of no use
</p>
<p>for me to try to contradict what has been said. I
</p>
<p>never was at a political meeting in my life not
</p>
<p>before this time, and I can assure you it was
</p>
<p>through Edwards, and the anxiety for my wife and
</p>
<p>family, which brought me to this sad unfortunate
</p>
<p>situation. 1 can assure your most high and mighty
</p>
<p>and gracious Sovereign, that I have been a true
</p>
<p>and faithful subject till now, but being in distress,
</p>
<p>and hearing the language I did, when irritated,
</p>
<p>took advantage of my distressed situation.
</p>
<p>I know not w^hat to say or how to address a
</p>
<p>King, but I hope your most gracious Majesty will
</p>
<p>spare my life  life for the sake of family  for
</p>
<p>I was not the inventor of this plot.
</p>
<p>1 shall in future, if your most gracious Majesty
</p>
<p>spare my life, be a true and faithful subject.

<p>WILLIAM DAVIDSON
</p>
<p>Was born in the year 1766, at Kingston, in
</p>
<p>Jamaica. His father was Mr. Attorney-General
</p>
<p>Davidson, a man ot* considerable legal knowledge
</p>
<p>and talent. He had several children.
</p>
<p>William, his second son, was sent to England

</p>
<p>wlicn very young, for the purpose of receiving an
</p>
<p>education suitable to the rank of his lather, and
</p>
<p>WILLIAM l)A\lDSOX. 407
</p>
<p>his own propccts. His mother was a native of
</p>
<p>the West-Indies, a woman of colour : she opposed
</p>
<p>her son being sent to England ; but her husband
</p>
<p>was resolved : he wished William to be brought
</p>
<p>up to his own profession  the law. William was
</p>
<p>theretbre sent to Edinburgh to be educated.
</p>
<p>Havin<r learned the first rudiments of education,
</p>
<p>he was sent to the academy of Dr.  , where
</p>
<p>he studied mathematics. Having left school, he
</p>
<p>went to his father's agent, a friend who resided
</p>
<p>near Liverpool.
</p>
<p>After some time he was apprenticed to a res-
</p>
<p>pectable attorney at Liverpool, at whose office
</p>
<p>he remained near three years, when he became
</p>
<p>tired of confinement. He had for some time felt
</p>
<p>great inclination to go to sea, and the captain of
</p>
<p>a vessel, to whom he disclosed his wishes upon
</p>
<p>the subject, promised to take him out as his
</p>
<p>clerk on his next voyage.
</p>
<p>Without taking leave of the gentleman to whom
</p>
<p>he was articled, he entered on board the mer-
</p>
<p>chant vessel, and soon had cause to repent, for
</p>
<p>after the vessel had left the port, he was com-
</p>
<p>pelled by the captain to perform duty.
</p>
<p>On the voyage a king's ship stopped the vessel,
</p>
<p>and impressed Davidson and many of the crew.
</p>
<p>He arrived in England about six raontlis after-
</p>
<p>wards, and wrote to his father's friend a suppli-
</p>
<p>catory letter. His lather's friend sent for him,
</p>
<p>and at his own particular desire, apprenticed him
</p>
<p>to a cabinet-maker, in Liverpool.
</p>
<p>Davidson was a personable young man, and
</p>
<p>was upon the point of marriage to the daughter of
</p>
<p>a respectable tradesman at Liverpool ; but her

</p>
<p>friends sent her off, and ])rcventcd the match
</p>
<p>taking place. Davidson being somewhat disap-
</p>
<p>pointed, determined to leave England, and to visit
</p>
<p>ins relatives at Kington, in Jamaica.
</p>
<p>He took a })assage on board of a West Lidia
</p>
<p>merchantman, and on his voyage again ex[)t-
</p>
<p>40h CATO-STREET CONSPIRACT
</p>
<p>rienced the misfortune of being impressed mto
</p>
<p>the King's service. He took the first opportu-
</p>
<p>nity of running away from the vessel on its arri-
</p>
<p>val in port, and having obtained some money
</p>
<p>from his friends, he got work at his trade as a
</p>
<p>journeyman.
</p>
<p>About twelve months after, his mother allowed
</p>
<p>him two guineas per week, which was paid him
</p>
<p>regularly through her agent. Davidson was
</p>
<p>employed by Mr. Bullock, a cabinet-maker at
</p>
<p>Litchfield. He was a most excellent workman,
</p>
<p>and was able to get three or four guineas a week,
</p>
<p>being a man of considerable taste in his profes-
</p>
<p>sion, and chiefly employed in fitting up the
</p>
<p>houses of noblemen and sfentlemen in the neiofh-
</p>
<p>bourhood.
</p>
<p>With his mother's allowance he was able to live
</p>
<p>and dress very genteelly ; and the company he
</p>
<p>kept was highly respectable. By some accident
</p>
<p>he met a young lady of the name of Salt, who
</p>
<p>resided at Litchfield ; she was only sixteen years
</p>
<p>of age. She imbibed a strong regard for Davidson,
</p>
<p>and, unknown to her family, she allowed him to
</p>
<p>visit her. Miss Salt had at her own disposal,
</p>
<p>when of age, the sum of 7,000/. She communi-
</p>
<p>cated to her mother her passion for Davidson.
</p>
<p>Her mother objected to it; but finding that
</p>
<p>nothing could wean her from her attachment,
</p>
<p>she consented to allow Davidson to visit her
</p>
<p>daughter.
</p>
<p>He frequently paid visits unknown to the young
</p>
<p>lady's father : the latter, however, at length ob-
</p>
<p>tained information of these clandestine interviews,
</p>
<p>and laid wait for him ; and, as he entered the

</p>
<p>garden late one evening, he fired a pistol at his
</p>
<p>head, and the ball it contained passed througli
</p>
<p>Davidson's hat. A constable was sent for, and
</p>
<p>Davidson was taken before a magistrate, charged
</p>
<p>with attempting to commit a robbery ; but
</p>
<p>upon Davidson stating the sim})le facts of

</p>
<p>the case, precisely as it occurred, that he was
</p>
<p>courting the daughter, with the privity of Mrs.
</p>
<p>Salt, though against the desire of Mr. Salt, he
</p>
<p>immediately set Davidson at liberty, and com-
</p>
<p>mitted Mr. Salt to prison for shooting at him.
</p>
<p>While Mr. Salt was in prison, he sent for
</p>
<p>Davidson, and promised him his daughter, if he
</p>
<p>would not prosecute him. Davidson did not
</p>
<p>appear against him, and he was set at liberty.
</p>
<p>Mr. Salt afterwards repented of his promise,
</p>
<p>and, to evade the pledge he had given, he told
</p>
<p>Davidson that he would not object if he would
</p>
<p>only wait till she was of age. Davidson com-
</p>
<p>municated to Miss Salt the wish of her father.
</p>
<p>She replied, " You know my sentiments towards
</p>
<p>you now. I cannot say, if I remain single till I
</p>
<p>am of age, what they may be then ;" and ex-
</p>
<p>pressed herself angry that Davidson should be
</p>
<p>inclined to agree to her father's proposal for de-
</p>
<p>ferring their union. Davidson had previously
</p>
<p>written to Jamaica, to his mother, and informed
</p>
<p>her of his intended union, and she had remitted
</p>
<p>1200/. to a banking house in London, and placed
</p>
<p>it at his disposal.
</p>
<p>Miss Salt was sent by her father to see a re-
</p>
<p>lative in a distant part of the country, and before
</p>
<p>she had been many months there, she married
</p>
<p>another suitor.
</p>
<p>Davidson, who had entertained very great
</p>
<p>affection for the lady, upon hearing that she had
</p>
<p>broken her faith with him, went to a chemist's
</p>
<p>shop at Litchfield, and in a fit of despair, pur-
</p>
<p>chased some poison, and took it ; he had not
</p>
<p>swallowed it long before he communicated to a

</p>
<p>friend the rash act he had committed, when the
</p>
<p>latter immediately procured a powerful antidote,
</p>
<p>which Davidson took, and which destroyed tlie
</p>
<p>effect of the poison in a great degree, though he
</p>
<p>was unwell for a considerable time after. Wiien

</p>
<p>lie recovered, be left the place, and took a large
</p>
<p>house near Birmmgham.
</p>
<p>With the money his mother had sent him he
</p>
<p>entered into an extensive way of business ; but
</p>
<p>being, from the disappointment in his marriage
</p>
<p>with Miss Salt, rendered quite unsettled in his
</p>
<p>mind, he did not attend to his business, and in
</p>
<p>a short time the whole of his money was ex-
</p>
<p>pended.
</p>
<p>Previous to his acquaintance with Miss Salt,
</p>
<p>he was employed by Lord Harrowby to fit up his
</p>
<p>house, and had frequent conversations with the
</p>
<p>Noble Lord upon the plan of decorating the in-
</p>
<p>terior of the mansion.
</p>
<p>After Davidson's failure in business, near Bir-
</p>
<p>mingham, he came to London, and was employed
</p>
<p>as a journeyman by Mr. Cox, a cabinet-maker, in
</p>
<p>the Haymarket, to whom he had been strongly
</p>
<p>recommended, by some gentlemen forming part of
</p>
<p>the congregation of a Chapel at Walworth, which
</p>
<p>Davidson frequented, and where he also made
</p>
<p>himself active as a teacher to the Sunday-school
</p>
<p>attached to the Chapel. It w^as during the period
</p>
<p>of his service with Mr. Cox, that the circumstance
</p>
<p>happened alluded to by Davidson on his trial,
</p>
<p>of an indelicate attack on the person of one of
</p>
<p>the female teachers at the school ; but we are
</p>
<p>compelled to state, that his account of the affair
</p>
<p>is directly the reverse of the truth. The fact
</p>
<p>was, that he habitually indulged in attempts of a
</p>
<p>gross and indelicate nature on the persons, not
</p>
<p>only of the teachers, but even of the children of
</p>
<p>the school ,- way-laying them on their return
</p>
<p>home, particularly in the evening after their

</p>
<p>attendance on divine worship, and taking im-
</p>
<p>proper liberties with them. The outward sanctity
</p>
<p>of the man screened him from suspicion, and the
</p>
<p>indelicate nature of his attacks silenced for too
</p>
<p>long a period the virtuous and innocent females.

</p>
<p>who were the objects of his vile attempts ; but
</p>
<p>at length his conduct became too gross for en-
</p>
<p>durance, and one of the ladies communicated it
</p>
<p>to the committee. This led to enquiry, and the
</p>
<p>result was the most perfect unmasking of the
</p>
<p>hypocrite, who was expelled with contempt and
</p>
<p>indignation from that society and religious com-
</p>
<p>munity, which he had so long disgraced by
</p>
<p>making it the means of indulging his brutal pro-
</p>
<p>pensities.
</p>
<p>After this detection and exposure, his conduct
</p>
<p>was more narrowly observed, and his habitual
</p>
<p>lying, prevarication, and intrigue, became noto-
</p>
<p>rious. Indeed he seemed to delight in evasion,
</p>
<p>and scarcely ever spoke the plain truth.
</p>
<p>About four years ago he entered into business
</p>
<p>for himself at Walworth, and then married a Mrs.
</p>
<p>Lane, the widow of a respectable man, who had
</p>
<p>left her with four small children ; for a short time
</p>
<p>he appeared to be doing w^ell. At length trade
</p>
<p>fell off, and he was obliged to remove to London.
</p>
<p>He then took a lodging in Mary-le-bone.
</p>
<p>lie had known Harrison (one of the transported
</p>
<p>conspirators) for several years previous to his
</p>
<p>coming to Walworth, and by him he was intro-
</p>
<p>duced to Thistlewood, and by the latter to Ed-
</p>
<p>wards, the spy.
</p>
<p>Edwards frequently called upon Davidson at
</p>
<p>his lodgings during the getting up of the Cato-
</p>
<p>street plot, and was, for several weeks before, his
</p>
<p>and Thistlcwood's constant companion. Edwards
</p>
<p>breakfasted with Davidson on the morning before
</p>
<p>the Cato-street y)lot was discovered; and on the
</p>
<p>same evening, in tlie presence of Mrs. Davidson,

<p>gave him money to get a blunderbuss out of
</p>

</p>
<p>On tlie Sunday night, when Davidson parted,
</p>
<p>for the last time, with his distressed wife, he
</p>
<p>expressed himsell" very strongly against Lord
</p>
<p>ISidmouth.

<p>After he had kissed her, he said, " If I should

</p>
<p>cowardice, but to my intense feelings for you and
</p>
<p>my dear children. Farewell, love ! pray that

<p>God will take mercy on me, and receive my soul."
</p>
<p>Mrs. Davidson then left him.

<p>This unfortunate woman is left with six chil-

</p>
<p>Procudings relative to George Edwards, the Spy.
</p>
<p>'On Tuesday, the 2d May, Mr. Alderman Wood
</p>
<p>rose in his place in the House of Commons, and
</p>
<p>said, that " he had a question to bring under the
</p>
<p>consideration of the house, which he considered
</p>
<p>as one of the greatest importance, and particu-
</p>
<p>larly to the house itself. He might be wrong in
</p>
<p>the course which he had proposed to himself to
</p>
<p>pursue ; but, if he were, the Speaker would, no
</p>
<p>doubt, instruct him what was the proper mode of
</p>
<p>bringing the matter forward. He had come to
</p>
<p>the determination of treating it as a breach of
</p>
<p>privilege ; and would here very briefly state what
</p>
<p>were the facts.
</p>
<p>*' Seven persons had applied to him, in his offi-
</p>
<p>cial capacity of magistrate, for a warrant to take
</p>
<p>up a man, stated to be then resident in Fleet-
</p>
<p>street, whose name was said to be George Ed-
</p>
<p>wards. He immediately went into a private
</p>
<p>examination of those individuals, with the assist-
</p>
<p>ance of Sir W. Domville. Four of the parties
</p>
<p>deposed to some very material facts, some of
</p>
<p>which, affecting the safety of that house, he should
</p>
<p>now mention ; but others, which were detailed at
</p>
<p>great length, were of too horrible a description
</p>
<p>for him to repeat.
</p>
<p>" They involved a plot, not merely to effect
</p>
<p>the destruction of that house, and the honourable
</p>
<p>members within it, but of one of the highest per-
</p>
<p>sonages in this kingdom, and of his majesty's
</p>
<p>ministers also. He would, however, confine him-
</p>
<p>self to the facts of the case as they regarded that
</p>
<p>house. Hg would read the words of the depo-

<p>pition.
</p>
<p>EDWAUDS, THE SPY. 417
</p>
<p>" Some time in that year deponent saw a man,
</p>
<p>of the name of Edwards, going from one public-
</p>
<p>house to another, inviting persons to unite with
</p>
<p>him in the execution of the plots against the go-
</p>
<p>vernment, which he intended to bring forward.
</p>
<p>It then went on to state, that one of his great
</p>
<p>plots was this :  He said, * that he could bring into
</p>
<p>the House of Commons six or eight men very rea-
</p>
<p>dily, and that it was not necessary that they should
</p>
<p>come in clean.' By that expression he meant,
</p>
<p>that they might easily enter the Honse with some-
</p>
<p>thing under their arms ; for thej' could so come
</p>
<p>into the lobby and other parts of the House with
</p>
<p>books ; no objection would be offered to their
</p>
<p>passing in with books under their arms.
</p>
<p>" Thee books were to have been filled with
</p>
<p>gun-barrels, cut down to the length of four inches
</p>
<p>only, which were to be filled with gunpowder,
</p>
<p>and plugged up at both ends ; and these imple-
</p>
<p>ments being thrown down in the middle of the
</p>
<p>House, upon some occasion of a full attendance,
</p>
<p>when it would be in a very crowded state, would
</p>
<p>explode with great violence, and cause much
</p>
<p>destruction. The deposition went on to shew,
</p>
<p>that Edwards on one occasion said, * Thistlewood
</p>
<p>is the boy for us ; he's the one to do our work :
</p>
<p>he will very soon be out of Horsham-gaoL' Now
</p>
<p>the evidence next showed, that, two days
</p>
<p>after, Thistlewood did come out of Horsham-
</p>
<p>gaol, and he was introduced to this Edwards at
</p>
<p>the house of Preston, the cobbler ; and that
</p>
<p>which was the strongest confirmation of the whole
</p>
<p>statement, and proved it beyond all douht, was,
</p>
<p>that Edwards did get those very books made for

</p>
<p>the purpose ; and that he procured the gun-barrels,
</p>
<p>and had them cut up.
</p>
<p>" At that time, too, he had not money enough
</p>
<p>to buy a pot of beer. All at once, however, he
</p>
<p>got su})p!icd with cash, and was enabled to pur-
</p>

</p>
<p>418 CATO-STRKET CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>chase several other weapons of defence, and arnib',
</p>
<p>which the deponents spoke of.
</p>
<p>" Now, this was the general substance of the
</p>
<p>depositions as they regarded thai house ; as to
</p>
<p>the other parts, which related to the intended
</p>
<p>taking off of certain individuals, he had hardly
</p>
<p>satisfied himself what might be the best mode of
</p>
<p>proceeding ; or whether, from the nature of the
</p>
<p>case, he might be justified in asking the House to
</p>
<p>indulge him with a committee of secrecy, in which
</p>
<p>case it would not be necessary for him to proceed
</p>
<p>with his present observations. The other details,
</p>
<p>however, which he did not at present feel it his
</p>
<p>duty to bring before the House, were of a most
</p>
<p>terrible description, and unfolded plots of the
</p>
<p>most dreadful character.
</p>
<p>" The persons who had made the depositions
</p>
<p>were respectable persons, and not at all impli-
</p>
<p>cated in the late legal proceedings, as having been
</p>
<p>evidence for the crown or for the prisoners. He
</p>
<p>had had several other persons with him that same
</p>
<p>morning, who were all ready to swear that they
</p>
<p>knew Edwards to have been engaged in these
</p>
<p>plots from time to time. lie had been asked by
</p>
<p>several individuals, how he intended to proceed
</p>
<p>in this case ; and he could now declare, that his
</p>
<p>mind was made up to call tliat person (Edwards)
</p>
<p>before the bar of the house. Whether, however,
</p>
<p>he should ask for a committee of secrecy, or pro-
</p>
<p>ceed in any other way, he was ready to bring
</p>
<p>this important business before them, and he
</p>
<p>thought that he discharged his duty in so
</p>
<p>doing. He had not thought it proper to swear
</p>
<p>those deponents to the truth of their allegations,

</p>
<p>because all the acts charged against Edwards
</p>
<p>were stated to have occurred either in the county
</p>
<p>of Middlesex or the city of Westminster. As he
</p>
<p>never interfered in such a case, he told the par-
</p>
<p>ties that they nnist go belbre a magistrate, cither
</p>
<p>EDWARDS, THE SPY. 419
</p>
<p>of Westminster or of the county ; or else that they
</p>
<p>must apply for a warrant to Lord Sidmouth. He
</p>
<p>directed them to go to his Lordship ; and pro-
</p>
<p>mised that, upon procuring the warrant, he would
</p>
<p>get it immediately backed, so as to make it ope-
</p>
<p>rative within the city of London.
</p>
<p>** He thought the thing a matter of such im-
</p>
<p>portance that he took the depositions in charge
</p>
<p>himself; and ordered the witnesses to attend him
</p>
<p>at Lord Sidmouth's immediately ; but it so hap-
</p>
<p>pened that his Lordship had left the place a few
</p>
<p>minutes before his arrival. He left the deposi-
</p>
<p>tions with a person whom he had now in his eye,
</p>
<p>and had received an answer ; but he did not think
</p>
<p>proper now to give it.
</p>
<p>*' The existence of such a man as this Edwards
</p>
<p>it was almost imj)ossible to conceive. It was
</p>
<p>difficult to imagine a man, going about with all
</p>
<p>this boldness from public-house to public-house 
</p>
<p>nay, even from one private house to another,
</p>
<p>framing and discoursing of all these plots. For
</p>
<p>his own part, however, when he looked at all the
</p>
<p>facts, he thought it clear tliat Edwards had be-
</p>
<p>come connected with the conspirators at a very
</p>
<p>early period ; and he pledged himself, that, if the
</p>
<p>house should adopt any question upon the subject,
</p>
<p>he would bring forward such evidence as must
</p>
<p>convict the man. It was only to be apprehended
</p>
<p>that he was not, perhaps, in the country, which
</p>
<p>he might have quitted by this time ; otherwise,
</p>
<p>no doubt, there were honourable gentlemen who
</p>
<p>were in possession of him, so that he might be
</p>
<p>produced. He, therefore, felt it his duty, under
</p>
<p>all the .circumstances, before he sat down, to move,

</p>
<p>* That George Edwards be immediately brought
</p>
<p>to the bar of this house.'"
</p>
<p>Mr. Bathurst objected to the motion, on
</p>
<p>the ground that an individual charged with such
</p>
<p>high crimes as those imputed to Edwards, was
</p>
<p>an improper person to be brought to the bar
</p>

</p>
<p>of the House of Commons, on the charge of a
</p>
<p>breach of privilege ; but stated that there was no
</p>
<p>doubt, if the question was brought before the
</p>
<p>House in a proper shape it would be entertained.
</p>
<p>Mr. Alderman Wood in reply said, " that he
</p>
<p>certainly set out with intimating that he saw great
</p>
<p>difficulties in this question, but was, indeed, quite
</p>
<p>happy to hear it observed, that if the business
</p>
<p>were brought before the House properly, the House
</p>
<p>would properly entertain it. He thought it right
</p>
<p>to state, that he had applied to another quarter,
</p>
<p>to get the individual in question prosecuted, but
</p>
<p>in that application he had been disappointed.
</p>
<p>" When he first read over the depositions,
</p>
<p>which were of a nature, he was sure, to make
</p>
<p>every man shudder with horror, he thought that
</p>
<p>not a moment was to be lost in taking Edwards
</p>
<p>up, if he could be found; and, he took it for
</p>
<p>granted that he could be found ; for he was known
</p>
<p>to have been in the possession of certain persons
</p>
<p>for a long time. His plots were truly diabolical ;
</p>
<p>and from the evidence it could be proved, beyond
</p>
<p>contradiction or dispute, ' that Edwards was the
</p>
<p>sole plotter and founder of the whole Cato-street
</p>
<p>plot.' At present knowing of no other way than
</p>
<p>the motion he had suggested by which the man
</p>
<p>might be brought to justice, he should leave the
</p>
<p>matter in the hands of the House."
</p>
<p>A short debate on the question then ensued,
</p>
<p>but it appearing that the charge could not regu-
</p>
<p>larly be entertained by the House as a breach of
</p>
<p>privilege, Mr. Alderman W^ood was induced to
</p>
<p>withdraw the motion for the present.

<p>newly- modelled his motion, so as to move for a
</p>
<p>committee of secrecy to examine the depositions
</p>
<p>in his possession, again called the attention of the

<p>that " in brin^ring forward the motion, he had no

<p>in this busi^iess, which he wished to have been

<p>Thomas Chambers, William Tunbridge, and George Pickard,

<p>which you left, in my absence, in the hands of Mr. Clive.

<p>Edwards, who is alluded to in those statements, is named in that

<p>list, and is liable to be called as a witness for the Crown ; and

<p>there does not appear to me any sufficient ground for instituting

<p>renew that question in a different form. I have received consi-

<p> My Lord,  I am honoured with your Lordship's answer to
</p>
<p>my letter of yesterday, respecting George Edwards, wherein
</p>
<p>you state, that " you know of no ground which could justify
</p>
<p>you in issuing a warrant against him." I consider that those
</p>
<p>depositions which I left at your Lordship's office, contain such
</p>
<p>charges as would fully justify your Lordship in apprehending
</p>
<p>George Edwards, Perhaps your Lordship's objections are, that
</p>
<p>they are not sworn ; if so, I beg to inform you that the parties

<p>ivere in attendance at your Lordship's office, to give evidence,
</p>
<p>and wore ready to be sworn to their statements, and are now
</p>
<p>ready, at an hour's notice, t-o attend your Lordship. I have also

<p>Whitehall, May 4, 1820.
</p>
<p>Sir,  I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of this

<p>day's date, in which I see no ground for altering the opinion
</p>
<p>communicated tQ.you in my former letters.

<p>wliole of this evidence, preparatory to his moving
</p>
<p>for a secret committee. His only wish was that
</p>
<p>a secret committee should be aj)pointed ; and if
</p>
<p>the House at once agreed to it, he should be quite
</p>
<p>contented with that result.
</p>
<p>" If he could show that Edwards was the
</p>
<p>j)erson who directed that plot  if he could show
</p>
<p>that he was going about for two years endeavour-
</p>
<p>ing to effect it  if he could prove that it was
</p>
<p>Edwards who purchased the swords and the arms
</p>
<p>of all kinds  if he could prove, by good evidence,
</p>
<p>that it was he who made the instruments of
</p>
<p>destruction which were produced on the trial, and
</p>
<p>others which might now be produced  he thought
</p>
<p>it would be quite impossible for the House to
</p>
<p>refuse his motion. He could substantiate all this
</p>
<p>by evidence  by the evidence of persons whose
</p>
<p>characters could not be impeached. He could
</p>
<p>bring forward witnesses, who had lived four, five,
</p>
<p>and six years with their employers, from whom they
</p>
<p>had received the best of characters. They stated,
</p>
<p>.hat Edwards had called on them at different
</p>
<p>times, and had endeavoured to seduce them : that
</p>
<p>he had drawn them into public-houses  that he
</p>
<p>had made purchases of arms  and that he had
</p>
<p>sent arms to their houses, they not knowing from
</p>
<p>whom those arms came, until subsequent evidence
</p>
<p>made them acquainted with the fact.
</p>
<p>" He had traced this man during a period of
</p>
<p>five years, although his motion was confirbed to
</p>
<p>two. Some years ago he was living at Windsor,
</p>
<p>and some favour was shown to him by persons

<p>about the Castle. He was employed as a modeller

<p>* The following: account of a professional intercourse with
</p>
<p>Edwards, who strove hard to convert it into a political con-
</p>
<p>nection, lias heen pnblislied by Mr. Carlile.
</p>
<p>" On my entering: the house at oo, Fleet-street, I became the
</p>
<p>neiti-hbour of Edwards, who previously held the little shop which

</p>
<p>adversity, at other times his circumstances were
</p>
<p>better. At one period he was walking about
</p>
<p>aware that I had taken 55, than he strenuously applied himself
</p>
<p>to become a tenant or lod'j2,er of mine, before 1 had the least
</p>
<p>idea of letting any ptirt of the house. I had a strong dislike to
</p>
<p>his appearance, and particularly the party whom he stated himself
</p>
<p>to be connected with, which were the Spenccans, and conse-
</p>
<p>quently gave him no hopes that I shoul-d receive him as lodger.
</p>
<p> ***-*
</p>
<p>He was in the habit of coming into the shop to purchase my
</p>
<p>pamphlets, and I soon conceived the notion of having a figure of
</p>
<p>Paine modelled ; he expressed himself quite anxious for the job,
</p>
<p>and observed, that from his admiration of the principles of
</p>
<p>Paine, he would be satisfied with a small price for it. On my
</p>
<p>wishing to fix him to a price, he proposed five pounds, which would
</p>
<p>ivst cover the expense he should be at, without including his
</p>
<p>time or abilities : this was agreed on immediately, and he was
</p>
<p>to proceed forthwith : this happened in the latter part of Febru-
</p>
<p>ary, or beginning of March.
</p>
<p>" A few days after Mr. Edwards expressed * wish to have
</p>
<p>the money before hand, and observed, that it was usual with
</p>
<p>modellers, i hesitated, refused, and ofiered him one pound,
</p>
<p>wliich he accepted. A head, or bust, was soon ready, and I
</p>
<p>gave him three guineas further, for the copyright of it, but I
</p>
<p>could get him no further with the figure, (although I had gone
</p>
<p>to the expense of the pedestal and other requisites for it,) until
</p>
<p>the fall of the year, the whole of which time he appeared to be in
</p>
<p>a state of abject poverty,  was obliged to give up his shop, and
</p>
<p>was never to be found at home. I urged him, by continual
</p>
<p>messages, to proceed with the figure, and, in the month of
</p>
<p>September, I got him to finish it.
</p>
<p>Edwards wos paid for his figure before it was finished and set
</p>
<p>up, and altogether considerably in addition to the first
</p>
<p>agreement.

<p>" From this time he stuck very close to me, on one pretence
</p>
<p>and th-p other ; followed me twice to Blackheath, for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of modelling my likeness on his own account, which he

</p>
<p>and twice solicited the loan of rnoney from me, after the figure
</p>
<p>of Paine was finished and paid for ; I as often refused him,
</p>
<p>because his whole conduct had convinced me that he was both
</p>
<p>dishonest and ill-disposed. I had never the smallest idea that
</p>
<p>he was a spy, and as I knew him to be in the habit of running
</p>
<p>after Thistlewood and his party, 1 often asked him what project
</p>
<p>ihev JKul in view, as a mutter of joke.

</p>
<p>the streets selling his busts, without shoes or
</p>
<p>stockings ; and all at once he became compara-
</p>
<p>tively rich. To account for this, he stated that he
</p>
<p>was the relation of a German count, from whom
</p>
<p>he had received some money ; in obtaining which,
</p>
<p>he said, he was assisted by Lord Castlereagh.
</p>
<p>This circumstance was sufficient to excite suspi-
</p>
<p>cion in any rational mind.
</p>
<p>" He would also prove that Edwards had been
</p>
<p>long connected with the police-ofhcers. This was
</p>
<p>a point which certainly must be considered as
</p>
<p>very important. He pledged himself to show
</p>
<p>that Edwards was in connexion with a police-
</p>
<p>officer who was the intimate friend of Castles, and
</p>
<p>by whom Castles was employed to entice indi-
</p>
<p>viduals to assist in the liberation of French officers,
</p>
<p>those individuals being immediately afterwards
</p>
<p>seized, for the purpose of procuring the reward.
</p>
<p>If he traced deeds of this description to Edwards,
</p>
<p>he contended that the committee ought to be
</p>
<p>granted. All this, doubtless, would be denied ;
</p>
<p>but he was prepared to prove it, and was deter-
</p>
<p>mined to do his duty. He had sought out the
</p>
<p>history of this man, as, on a former occasion, he
</p>
<p>investigated and exposed the conduct of three
</p>
<p>individuals who stood in a similar situation, and
</p>
<p>who, for the purpose of receiving the reward, were
</p>
<p>inciting men to the rommission of crimes.
</p>
<p>" When, at last, he brought the villany of this
</p>
<p>atrocious traitor (he could not denominate him a
</p>
<p>man) before the House  when he traced him,
</p>
<p>forming his plots  meeting individuals at an ap-

<p>he proved that Edwards had brought Thistlewood

<p>that lodging for him  that he did not cause his

<p>waited until the Gazette, offering a reward of
</p>
<p>1,000/., was published ;  when he proved all this,
</p>
<p>could they refuse a fall and fair enquiry ? He
</p>
<p>could incontestibly show, that Edwards told the

<p>persons engaged in the conspiracy, in case they
</p>
<p>were disturbed, to follow him to Grosvenor-

<p>made, he informed Mrs. Thistlewood where her

<p>husband was ; that he went the next morning to

<p>Harris's, and desired him to keep Thistlewood all
</p>
<p>day, and that he would be removed at night ; and
</p>
<p>finally, that he brought the officers to seize him.
</p>
<p>" He could further show that Edwards had
</p>
<p>taken lodgings, under the assumed name of Walls,
</p>
<p>in Pimlico. He referred the owner of the house
</p>
<p>to a porter, at Buckingham-gate, for his character,

<p>who told him, ' This is Mr. Walls, of Windsor.'

<p>He remained at these lodgings for a considerable

<p>The following- is Pickard's deposition :
</p>
<p>EDWARDS, THE SPY. 4_17
</p>
<p>working for his father, deposed that he had
</p>
<p>casually met with Edwards at a public-house.
</p>
<p>Edwards called him by name, thoui^h he did not
</p>
<p>recollect having seen him before. Edwards told
</p>
<p>him " It was time the b  y thieves was des-
</p>
<p>troyed. A number of persons, say six (he con-
</p>

<p>*' George Pickard, 15, Hare-Street, Bethnal Green, says,
</p>
<p>I know Edwards. I first saw him before the first Smithfield
</p>
<p>Meeting-. I never much associated with him, I considered him
</p>
<p>so much of a blackguard, I knew his brother also, who was
</p>
<p>secretary to the Spencean Society. I met him some time about
</p>
<p>July, at the \Vhiie Lyon in Wych Street; there were two or
</p>
<p>three others there. He knew me, better than I did lain. lie
</p>
<p>asked me how I did, and said, ' What a pity it is, Pickard, that
</p>
<p>we can t destroy these b vermin.' A trifling conversation
</p>
<p>took place ; at last, ' I'll tell you what it is,' said he, ' any body
</p>
<p>can get into the House of Commons with an order, nor does
</p>
<p>it require that tliey should go clean. Suppose we have an iron

<p>carry in a book,) and have some old gun or pistol barrels, which
</p>
<p>may be got cheap, cut into pieces about three or four inches
</p>
<p>long: let them be plugged up at each end with lead, and the
</p>
<p>centre filled with powder, and a touch-hole made ; half a dozen
</p>
<p>of cases may be made full of them, for a similar number of men
</p>
<p>to take into the House. One man might have a bottle of phos-

<p>laughing at the idea. He next said, that 'I'histlewood would

<p>farther -said, that Edwards gave him a small steel
</p>
<p>instrument, to fix to a walking-stick. He also
</p>
<p>stated that Edwards was constantly going after
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>" Another individual, William Coudry, stated,
</p>
<p>that he attended several meetings when Edwards
</p>
<p>was present, and was informed by him, on one oc-
</p>
<p>casion, that a cabinet dinner was to be given at
</p>
<p>Lord Westmoreland's, at which Lord Castlereagh
</p>
<p>would be present. Edwards said, ' the b y
</p>
<p>Irish butcher must be made away with.' Coudry
</p>
<p>stated also that he had oftpn seen Edwards after-
</p>
<p>wards preparing destructive instruments.
</p>
<p>** A person named Seymour stated, that he
</p>
<p>knew Edwards four or five years, having met him
</p>
<p>some time ago, and he proposed that deponent
</p>
<p>said, It might be put into a common walking cane by having a
</p>
<p>hole bored in the bottom, and be instantly fit for use. I told
</p>
<p>him I must know him better before I would have any thing to
</p>
<p>do with him. He replied, that Thistlewood knew him well, and
</p>
<p>that that would be a sufficient recommendation. I met
</p>
<p>Edwards and Thistlewood previous to the Cato-Street business,
</p>
<p>on the Saturday. Thistlewood asked me various questions res-
</p>
<p>pecting business, and after shaking hands he bid me good day.
</p>
<p>Then Edwards turned quite round, and after looking for some
</p>
<p>minutes, held his hand out to shake hands. 1 do not recollect
</p>
<p>the first few sentences that passed, but on parting he said, ' You
</p>
<p>b Pickard, you must fight before long.' On the following
</p>
<p>Monday two'persons called at my lodgings, when I was absent,
</p>
<p>and inquired for me. One of them answered the description of
</p>
<p>Edwards. They left no message, but called again on Tuesday,

<p>but I was away : 1 never heard of him since then. Previous to
</p>
<p>the last time of my seeing Edwards I went to the Scotch Arms,
</p>
<p>in Round-Court, Strand, and saw Adams and Edwards there.
</p>
<p>They both talked about destroying the Ministers, and invited
</p>
<p>me to go to a meeting, and Adams gave me a grenade, and
</p>
<p>Edwards gave me a small pike. I told Whadman of the
</p>
<p>circumstance ; he advisod me to have nothing to do with the
</p>
<p>business. Adams and Edwards called at my lodgings the day

</p>
<p>should go to a meeting in Smithfield. He replied
</p>
<p>to Edwards, that he would not go, for that he was
</p>
<p>not inclined to join in those bad pranks. Edwards
</p>
<p>afterwards told this man that the meeting had not
</p>
<p>turned out to their expectation. This was a man
</p>
<p>of considerable respectability. Another man had
</p>
<p>seen Edwards at a coffee-house, in June, and was
</p>
<p>told by him that the only means was, to destroy
</p>
<p>his majesty's ministers, by throwing hand-gre-
</p>
<p>nades into their carriages. Another individual
</p>
<p>was called on by Edwards on the 19th of Au-
</p>
<p>gust, three days after the dispersion of the meeting.
</p>
<p>Edwards stated to him, that Manchester was on
</p>
<p>fire, that the New Bailey was taken, and that Hunt
</p>
<p>as killed, and added. ' Come out immediately,
</p>
<p>all are ready ; we have nothing to do but rallying
</p>
<p>our forces.' Edwards came again at eight in
</p>
<p>the evening, and said something so wicked,
</p>
<p>that the man would have nothing more to do with
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>'" Edwards called on another man at his mecha-
</p>
<p>nical business, and asked if the men were all re-
</p>
<p>formers. After coming several times he saw a
</p>
<p>s\vx)rd hung up in the place, and said he would be
</p>
<p>very much obliged to him for it. The individual
</p>
<p>gave it. Edwards said, ' you have more V He
</p>
<p>replied that he had not. Edwards said such swords
</p>
<p>were very cheap, and they Ponld get them aS
</p>
<p>cheap as the government. The man gave him no
</p>
<p>more, but soon afterwards a bundle was brought
</p>
<p>to him containing twenty-four swords and some
</p>
<p>pikes, and Edwards carried away a number of
</p>
<p>them under his coat, and sent for others. He said
</p>
<p>to this individual, ' Pray come and see what we

<p>are about.' He went, and saw Edwards in a
</p>
<p>flannel jacket, surrounded with combustibles; he
</p>
<p>saw him making cartridges and hand-grenades,
</p>
<p>and arranging all the implements of destruction.

<p>430 CATO-STRKET CONSIMIIACY.
</p>
<p>" A man of the name of Chambers * was visited
</p>
<p>by Edwards, and was desired to permit him to
</p>
<p>* Chamber's doposilion, is as follows ; 
</p>
<p>" I, Thomiis Chanibors^ say, that 1 ;iiu a l)Ootmakor, residing
</p>
<p>at 3, lleatheock Court, Strand, and have been in the em-
</p>
<p>ployment of Mr. , shoemaker, Tavistock-street, lor
</p>
<p>seven years, and still continue to work for him; that about
</p>
<p>five months aj^o I bicanie acijuainted with Geory^e Edwards,
</p>
<p>by meeting him by accident at tlie White Lion, Wych-street;
</p>
<p>that some time atter he called upon me, at which I was
</p>
<p>much surprised, not knowing much of him ; he at the sanie time
</p>
<p>talked aluuit politics in ii strange violent manner; he came to
</p>
<p>nie again soon after, and hold tlu' saMio sort of language, saying,
</p>
<p>It was nonsense talking, pt.<)[le must arm themselves/ Oa
</p>
<p>Christmas Eve he again called on me, with several persons,
</p>
<p>among whom were two Irishmen, who were drunk, and wlu>in I
</p>
<p>had never seen before. Edwards M tlu.. time had with him an
</p>
<p>old oavulry sword which he kept under his coat, and also a
</p>
<p>sword stick in his hand. He said to the Irishu.cn, ' woidd not
</p>
<p>you wish to have Castlcreagh's head to carry about on a pole, for
</p>
<p>the good he has done your country.' One of the Irishmen said,
</p>
<p> lie,' meaning l.ortl (.'astlereagh, * is a big rogue ;' ou \\luch Ed-
</p>
<p>wards said, * Here is what will cut oil' his b  y head,' One of the
</p>
<p>Irishmen said lie avouKI not enter into any thiig until he was
</p>
<p>sworn. Edwards then asked me for a Bible to swear the man : I
</p>
<p>said, I will have no swc aring here, and being at work, and not
</p>
<p>liking their language and noise, I bid them to leave my house,
</p>
<p>and ihoy went away. E.dwards called on me again about a week
</p>
<p>at'ter, much against, my wish, and held forth, in violent language
</p>
<p>about the government, and said, ' that iifter the tyrants (mean-
</p>
<p>ing ministers) were cut oil'. Hunt and (\ibbett. must go to pot.'
</p>
<p>Emding I did not like their language, he went away. About a
</p>
<p>fortnight bitbre the Cato-strcef !>iwinoc>; P.lxx-ird^ <--.iI1<h1 on me.

<p>und said t<.> nu , ' the tyrarus must fall,' and added, ' all must

</p>
<p>come together armed, and you must come with your sword and
</p>
<p>pistol, as I suppose you have got them.' I told him I had no-
</p>
<p>thing of tJie kind: he then said that I should not want for them.
</p>
<p>Soma $lK)rt time after this he came to my lodgings ipiite down
</p>
<p>in spirits, and said he could not tiud any one to have courage to
</p>
<p>join, and he had a great mind to cut his thnial. A short time
</p>
<p>after this Edwards came again with two men, and in good
</p>
<p>spirits, and saitl, ' I suppose y^>n will i:^o willi us, you know
</p>
<p>what I mean ;' I answered, 1 do not ; he said, ' you are not such
</p>
<p>a fool, as not to know there is something on foot, we mean to
</p>
<p>destroy ministers.' 1 answered, that I would not be in such a
</p>
<p>Despard's business. He then clajiped his hand on tlie wall ot
</p>
<p>the house, and said. ' this is all lath and plaster, and you siian't
</p>
<p>be safe, we'll bloN'. >ou oul ot vour bed.' 1 did not see Ed-

</p>
<p>leave there some arms. Edwards said that all
</p>
<p>was ready. He oftered money to two Irishmen,
</p>
<p>who came in, and brought them to a public-house, ,
</p>
<p>where he treated them with some drink. Mary'
</p>
<p>Barker, daughter of one of the unfortunate men,
</p>
<p>stated that the hand-grenades and other tilings
</p>
<p>found in her father's (Tidd's) house, were entirely^
</p>
<p>brought in the night before by Edwards. *<
</p>
<p>" Another individual  he was not desired by
</p>
<p>any of those persons to conceal their names, and
</p>
<p>if any member wished for the names he was ready
</p>
<p>to give them,  the individual to whom he alluded
</p>
<p>knew Edwards ; he had known William Edwards,
</p>
<p>brother of this Edwards, connected with the
</p>
<p>police, and had worked with him at the palace at
</p>
<p>Windsor. This man was conducted by Edwards
</p>
<p>to Cato-street, but when he saw the preparations
</p>
<p>there, he immediately ran away. Edwards pre-
</p>
<p>sented his sword to prevent another from going
</p>
<p>away from Cato-strcet. To another person Ed-
</p>
<p>wards said, * Now is the time to destroy his
</p>
<p>majesty's ministers, if the country is not to be
</p>
<p>ruined.' The man replied, ' Such a thing might
</p>
<p>do very well for a foreigner ; it would not do for
</p>
<p>an Englishman,' Edwards then gat Thistlcwood
</p>
<p>to come along with him to this man, Thistlcwood
</p>
<p>had sold an estate to a friend of the man's, and
</p>
<p>wards after this till Monday, the 21st f February, when he
</p>
<p>came, in company with a rery tall man, who had a cast in his eye,
</p>
<p>and Edwards had a large bag with him, which he requested me
</p>
<p>to allow him to leave in my room. I asked him what it con-
</p>
<p>tained, he replied, ' Oh! only a ton- pistols, and such like.' I
</p>
<p>instantly bid him take them away, that I would have nothiag.to
</p>
<p>do with such things in my place. He urged mc very much to

</p>
<p>permit the bag to remain, but I would not. 1 again told him I
</p>
<p>would on no account have any thing to do with such things, and
</p>
<p>immediately made him take the bag away, assisted by the per-
</p>
<p>sons who came with him. Since then I have seen nothing of
</p>
<p>Edwards."

</p>
<p>was therefore known to him. But the man said
</p>
<p>to them, 'I'll hear no more of that.'
</p>
<p>" Another man was applied to by Edwards, on
</p>
<p>the 19th of January, and was told by him that
</p>
<p>the destruction of ministers, either in their car-
</p>
<p>riages or at cabinet dinners, was determined on.
</p>
<p>He would not weary the house by detailing all the
</p>
<p>practices of this infernal person. One very long
</p>
<p>and very interesting paper in this matter, which
</p>
<p>explained the whole from beginning to end, was
</p>
<p>written by one of the unfortunate individuals who
</p>
<p>had been seduced  it might therefore be said that
</p>
<p>it was deserving of little credit. Another person
</p>
<p>stated Edwards to have been patronized at Wind-
</p>
<p>sor, and that he. knew him to be a spy. Another
</p>
<p>person, who had been on the waggon at the Smith-
</p>
<p>field meeting, stated, that Edwards gave a hint
</p>
<p>to a person who was about to speak of what he
</p>
<p>should say gave him a pint of beer  told him to
</p>
<p>speak out, and among other things suggested, that
</p>
<p>they were ready with fire-balls. It was a very
</p>
<p>extraordinary disclosure, and never had there been
</p>
<p>a thing devised so well. In the whole proceed-
</p>
<p>ings not one instance was found of one person
</p>
<p>seduced, seducing another. A was not found to
</p>
<p>have seduced B ; but in all cases Edwards was
</p>
<p>the seducer.
</p>
<p>** Of some of the papere h \vas not prepared
</p>
<p>to give any account, as they had come into his
</p>
<p>hands only since he came into the house ; but he
</p>
<p>had stated the facts brought forward by such per
</p>
<p>sons as were sufficient to convict Edwards. He
</p>
<p>should hear, perhaps, that those persons were
</p>
<p>themselves guilty of misprision of treason ; he

</p>
<p>was prepared to hear that, and to say something
</p>
<p>in reply. But that did not at all lessen the guilt
</p>
<p>of the individual who was seducing others to acts
</p>
<p>of treason. Edwards had gone on with these
</p>
<p>practices, and supplied others with money. He
</p>
<p>could prove money to have passed from Edwards

</p>
<p>to many of the deluded persons. It was remark-
</p>
<p>able that Edwards was n'ear the spot when Thistle-
</p>
<p>wood was taken in Harris's house. Whether he
</p>
<p>had received the 1,000/, or not, he did not know.
</p>
<p>If he had, he could now live without labour, at
</p>
<p>least without such labour as he might otherwise
</p>
<p>be dependent on.
</p>
<p>" This was established by the testimony of a
</p>
<p>very respectable man, who kept a school in St.
</p>
<p>George's, Hanover-square, with respect to whose
</p>
<p>conduct in this business the trustees had held a
</p>
<p>meeting, and found nothing to blame. This gen-
</p>
<p>tleman (Air. Fowler) was applied to by Edwards
</p>
<p>under the nan:io of Wards, for lodgingfs, and Mr.
</p>
<p>Wake, who kept Buckingham-gate, said to Mr.
</p>
<p>Fowler that he was a respectable person. After
</p>
<p>he had been six weeks there, he said to Mr. Fow-
</p>
<p>ler, if Mr. Sheriff Parkins or Air. Sheriff Roth-
</p>
<p>\vell should call lor him, his name was Edwards.
</p>
<p>Mr. Fowler exclaimed, ' Good God ! have I got
</p>
<p>a spy in my house all this time?' There had been
</p>
<p>no subscription to provide any money, except in-
</p>
<p>deed a trifle for one of the persons implicated,
</p>
<p>who had been in the debtors' prison, but it was
</p>
<p>very small. There had been, therefore no money
</p>
<p>provided among them that could account for Ed-
</p>
<p>wards' mode of livinir and acting." The worthy
</p>
<p>alderman concluded by moving, ' That a secret
</p>
<p>committee be a|)))ointed to examine evidence
</p>
<p>touching the criminal conduct of George Edwards
</p>
<p>for the last tM o years, and particularly touching
</p>
<p>his connexion with the conspiracy detected in
</p>
<p>Cato-street.'
</p>
<p>The motion was seconded by Sir Robert Wil-

<p>son, and a warm and animated debate, between
</p>
<p>most of the leading members of the house ensued,
</p>
<p>in which the ])rinciple of employing spies wan
</p>
<p>stronulv censured and condemned by some mem-
</p>
<p>bers, and approved of and supported by others,
</p>
<p>as a justifiable nu^asure of state p(.)licy. The ques-

<p>tion was. however, ultimately negatived.

</p>
<p>The exertions of Mr. Alderman Wood in the
</p>
<p>House of Commons having been rendered nugatory
</p>
<p>by the rejection of this motion, recourse was had
</p>
<p>to the ordinary means of justice, and on Monday
</p>
<p>the 22d of May, the Grand Jury for the County
</p>
<p>of Middlesex found a true bill against George
</p>
<p>Edwards, for Higrh Treason, and amonof the wit-
</p>
<p>nesses examined by the Grand Jury in support
</p>
<p>of the charge were, Mrs. Thistlewood, Mrs. Brunt,
</p>
<p>and Julian Thistlewood, (the son). Mr. Harmer
</p>
<p>was authorized to offer a reward for the apprehen-
</p>
<p>sion of Edwards, and the following advertisement
</p>
<p>immediately appeared in the newspapers :
</p>
<p>High Treason.  One Hwidred Guineas Reward.
</p>
<p>A True Bill of indictment havincr been found by the Middle-
</p>
<p>sex Grand Jury against GEORGE EDWARDS for HIGH
</p>
<p>TREASON, whoever will apprehexid and lodge the said George
</p>
<p>Edwards in any of his Majesty's Gaols, shall, on application to
</p>
<p>Mr. James Harmer, of llatton-garden, London, receive the
</p>
<p>above reward.
</p>
<p>The said George Edwards is by trade a modeller ; he is about
</p>
<p>5 feet 3 inches high, thin and pale faced, with an aquiline nose,
</p>
<p>grey eyes, and light brown hair ; he has lately gone by the name
</p>
<p>of Wards, and is supposed to be about to leave this country for
</p>
<p>Ne/f Brunswick under that assumed name.
</p>
<p>The retreat of Edwards, however, has never
</p>
<p>oeen HiscoverpH, anrl thp> g<^n3rp1 expectation ..is
</p>
<p>that a free pardon will be granted to him for all
</p>
<p>acts of treason committed previous to a certain
</p>
<p>time, by which he will be secured against the
</p>
<p>consequences of the bill found against him.
