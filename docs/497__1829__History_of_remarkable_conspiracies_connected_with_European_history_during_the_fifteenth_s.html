<p>PREFACE.
</p>
<p>In laying this Work before the Public,
</p>
<p>my object has been to give as luminous
</p>
<p>a view as my limits would permit, of the
</p>
<p>causes of the various enterprises narrated
</p>
<p>in these volumes.
</p>
<p>It is necessary to observe, that in the ac-
</p>
<p>count of the Assassination of James I., I
</p>
<p>have followed the document inserted in the
</p>
<p>first volume of Pinkerton's History, which
</p>
<p>that historian has himself used. The death
</p>
<p>of James III. cannot be well understood,
</p>
<p>without giving a brief sketch of his eventful
</p>
<p>reign ; and although I have perhaps dwelt
</p>
<p>longer on it than was absolutely necessary,
</p>
<p>as it is a very important period of our na-
</p>
<p>tional history, it could not be avoided, with-
</p>
<p>out making any account of the lamentable
</p>
<p>end of that monarch imperfect. It has no
</p>
<p>other pretensions than that of being a com-
</p>
<p>pilation of facts ; yet history, after all, must
</p>

</p>
<p>of necessity be a compilation.
</p>
<p>VIU PREFACE.
</p>
<p>The Conspiracy of Fiesco against Genoa,
</p>
<p>is reprinted. As I have prepared an intro-
</p>
<p>ductory notice in its proper place, it is un-
</p>
<p>necessary to repeat my observations here.
</p>
<p>The Death of Don Carlos is a mere
</p>
<p>sketch, compiled from various sources, of an
</p>
<p>affair so involved, that it is extremely diffi-
</p>
<p>cult to separate truth from fable. It has
</p>
<p>been variously treated by the friends and
</p>
<p>enemies of Philip, and has afforded a theme
</p>
<p>for the inventions of poets and romancers.
</p>
<p>But, in whatever light it is viewed it will
</p>
<p>never be forgotten, that the ikte of that
</p>
<p>Prince is the groundwork of one of Schiller's
</p>
<p>Tragedies, of one of Otway's great efforts,
</p>
<p>and of one of the finest pieces of historical
</p>
<p>romance by the Abbe St Real.
</p>
<p>The Gowrie Conspiracy is certainly one of
</p>
<p>the most mysterious events recorded in his-
</p>
<p>tory, and to it I would beg the attention of the
</p>
<p>reader. I have taken, doubtless, a peculiar
</p>
<p>view of it, as connected with the events of
</p>
<p>that j:)eriod ; but such subjects are now open
</p>
<p>to discussion, and every individual is en-
</p>
<p>titled to hold his own opinion. Fortunate-
</p>
<p>ly, all doubt as to the reality of the Con-

<p>spiracy is ended, by the recent discovery
</p>
<p>PREFACE. IX
</p>
<p>of the Original Letters of Logan of Restal-
</p>
<p>rig, in the Register- Office, Edinburgh. To
</p>
<p>Robert Pitcairn, Esq., the able Editor of
</p>
<p>the Criminal Trials, I am under very great
</p>
<p>obligations, for having put into my hands a
</p>
<p>mass of interesting documents connected
</p>
<p>with this Conspiracy, hitherto unpublished,
</p>
<p>and of which I have made as much use as
</p>
<p>my limits would permit. Indeed the latter
</p>
<p>part of the narrative is almost wholly pre-
</p>
<p>pared from these documents, and from the
</p>
<p>subsequent proceedings of the government
</p>
<p>contained in that splendid work, " The Acts
</p>
<p>of the Parliament of Scotland" recently print-
</p>
<p>ed by the command of his present Majesty.
</p>
<p>The second volume must speak for itself.
</p>
<p>It is not too much to say, that its contents
</p>
<p>will be found perhaps more interesting than
</p>
<p>the first ; and it is hoped, that, altogether,
</p>
<p>these portions of history, in which human
</p>
<p>character and adventure are brought so con-
</p>
<p>spicuously before the reader, as illustrative
</p>
<p>of what men have hazarded for the accom-
</p>
<p>plishment of ambitious projects, or to gratify
</p>
<p>revenge, will not be unacceptable to the
</p>
<p>Public.

<p>THE

<p>OF

<p>JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER I.
</p>
<p>Heaven from all creatures hides the book of fate,
</p>
<p>All but the page prescribed, their present state :
</p>
<p>From brutes what men, from men what spirits know,
</p>
<p>Or who would suffer being here below ?
</p>
<p>The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to-day,
</p>
<p>Had he thy rea;?on, would he skip and play ?
</p>
<p>Plcas'd to the last, he crops the flowery food.
</p>
<p>And licks the hand just rais'd to shed his blood.

</p>
<p>From the death of Robert III. in 1405, till 1586,
</p>
<p> a period of one hundred and eighty-one years 
</p>
<p>it was the misfortune of Scotland to be governed by
</p>
<p>a succession of minors. The consequences in a
</p>
<p>rude and turbulent age, and among a people com-
</p>
<p>pletely under the control of their feudal superiors,

</p>
<p>may be easily conceived. The progress of im-
</p>
<p>16 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>provement and civilization was restrained ; domestic
</p>
<p>broils, and the evils of factious ambition, complete-
</p>
<p>ly depressed the spirit of the nation.
</p>
<p>At no period of Scottish history, perhaps, were
</p>
<p>these more apparent than when James, the first of
</p>
<p>that name, acceded to the government, after a capti-
</p>
<p>vity of nineteen years in England. The feeble reign
</p>
<p>of Robert III. had abundantly encouraged the spirit
</p>
<p>of faction ; and the infamous murder of the unfortu-
</p>
<p>nate Rothsay at Falkland, by Ramorny and his
</p>
<p>associates, who were suborned by the Duke of Al-
</p>
<p>bany and the Earl of Douglas, is a proof of the
</p>
<p>weakness of Robert's administration, and the un-
</p>
<p>principled ambition of his relatives. The imprison-
</p>
<p>ment of James in England rendered a regency ne-
</p>
<p>cessary ; and Roberts own brother, the Duke of
</p>
<p>Albany, by various arts and crimes, obtained the
</p>
<p>administration of the government, which he held
</p>
<p>for thirteen years with a vigour rarely witnessed
</p>
<p>at his great age. * His son Murdac succeeded 
</p>
<p>a regent of a different character, weak, indolent,
</p>
<p>and remiss in his authority, who was maintained
</p>
<p>in his brief regency of four years solely by the
</p>
<p>peculiar circumstances of the times.
</p>
<p>It was the misfortune of James I. that he lived
</p>
<p>at that period ; for a prince he was worthy of a
</p>
<p>better age and a more enlightened and civilized
</p>
<p>kingdom. His imprisonment in England had not
</p>
<p>been without its advantages, and the greatest care
</p>
<p>had been bestowed on his education. In him,
</p>
<p>after two feeble reigns, and two regencies equal-
</p>
<p>ly inactive, the House of Stuart was at last to
</p>

</p>
<p>ments  " a man of science and learning, an ex-
</p>
<p>cellent poet, a master of music :  illustrious in
</p>

</p>
<p>gant writing, and miniature painting, to mechani-
</p>
<p>cal arts, and to the cultivation of the garden and
</p>
<p>the orchard. " *
</p>
<p>As it is not my province here to discuss the
</p>
<p>state of Scotland when James assumed the go-
</p>
<p>vernment, I shall pass at once, after a few histori-
</p>
<p>cal notices, to the narration of the tragedy which
</p>
<p>terminated the existence of the most accomplish-
</p>
<p>ed prince of his age. After a number of salutary
</p>
<p>regulations, James soon astonished the nobles
</p>
<p>by his bold proceedings. His first act was to
</p>
<p>humble the ambitious family of Albany ; and
</p>
<p>in a Parliament held at Perth, 1425, he arrest-
</p>
<p>ed the Duke of Albany, his two sons, the Earls of
</p>
<p>Lennox, Douglas, Angus, and March, Sir Robert
</p>
<p>Graham, and more than twenty barons of great
</p>
<p>power. Some of tltese were afterwards released,
</p>
<p>but a full measure of revenge was in reserve for
</p>
<p>Albany and his sons. Seated on the throne of
</p>
<p>justice, James himself presided at their trial; and
</p>
<p>among the jury were some of those whom he
</p>
<p>had formerly ordered to be arrested. By this
</p>
<p>jury, Murdac of Albany, Duncan Earl of Lennox

<p>18 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>his father-in-law, and his two sons, were con-
</p>
<p>demned. Walter, the late Regent's eldest son,
</p>
<p>was beheaded on the very day of his condemna-
</p>
<p>tion ; and on the following day, Albany himself,
</p>
<p>Alexander his second son, and the Earl of Len-
</p>
<p>nox, were led out to execution. It was a severe,
</p>
<p>though, perhaps, a just retribution ; yet the vulgar
</p>
<p>beheld it not without commiseration. The former
</p>
<p>authority of Albany, the venerable age of Len-
</p>
<p>nox, then approaching his eightieth year, and the
</p>
<p>noble appearance of the third, excited those feelings
</p>
<p>which invariably result from the sight of greatness
</p>
<p>in misfortune. *
</p>
<p>But the execution of these noblemen brought
</p>
<p>for a while peace to Scotland ; and James applied
</p>
<p>himself still farther to the improvement and civi-
</p>
<p>lization of his subjects. Many wise and efficient
</p>
<p>laws were enacted, while the boldness and vigour
</p>
<p>of the administration seemed to check all disposi-
</p>
<p>tion to faction and turbulence. But the schemes
</p>
<p>of the King for the humbling of the nobility were
</p>
<p>observed with rancorous and malignant hatred ;
</p>
<p>and there were those among them who had re-
</p>
<p>solved to rid themselves of a sovereign before
</p>
<p>whom they trembled, divested of their power and
</p>
<p>feudal greatness, opposed by a vigour which Bruce
</p>
<p>himself, the restorer of the Scottish monarchy,
</p>
<p>had only once presumed to exercise, and which
</p>
<p>even to him had well nigh proved fatal.
</p>
<p>It was thus, while James I. was proceeding
</p>
<p>with a boldness and determination which astonish-
</p>
<p>ed his nobility, and which amounted even to rash-
</p>
<p>ness, a confederacy was secretly forming, the con-

<p>ing of the Kin^, and the elevation of another to
</p>
<p>his throne. Unfortunately for James, his sum-
</p>
<p>mary revenge on the family of Albany had ren-
</p>
<p>dered him exposed to such dangerous associations.
</p>
<p>While the nobles were exasperated at his pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings, and alleged that avarice, and not justice,
</p>
<p>prompted him to procure so many confiscations,
</p>
<p>the people were no less disposed to view with dis-
</p>
<p>pleasure the subsidies levied from them, which
</p>
<p>they had hitlierto been unaccustomed to advance,
</p>
<p>not perceiving that a king without a treasury must
</p>
<p>necessarily become the tool of faction, and unable
</p>
<p>to maintain the exigencies of state ; and as those
</p>
<p>subsidies had not been exsicted from them in for-
</p>
<p>mer reigns, although attached to their sovereign,
</p>
<p>they were disposed to view his government as ty-
</p>
<p>rannical. No inconsiderable murmurings, there-
</p>
<p>fore, existed among them, while a few of the
</p>
<p>nobles were conspiring together to recover their
</p>
<p>former power and independence.
</p>
<p>Certain circumstances occurred, which proved
</p>
<p>favourable to the designs of the confederates.

<p>had been generally well observed, with the excep-
</p>
<p>tion of the usual maraudings on the Borders, till
</p>
<p>the year 1435, when the treaty then existing was
</p>
<p>infringed on the part of England. In support of
</p>
<p>some of those who had opposed the King's autho-
</p>
<p>rity, and who had been exiled in consequence. Sir
</p>
<p>Robert Ogle the Younger entered Scotland at the
</p>
<p>head of a considerable force, and committed se-
</p>
<p>veral ravages in the southern counties. He was
</p>
<p>opposed, however, by the Earl of Angus, Hep-
</p>
<p>burn of Hailes, and Ramsay of Dalhousie ; and,
</p>
<p>after a battle, in which upwards of forty men were
</p>
<p>slain, he was defeated and taken prisoner. James,
</p>
<p>enraged at this violation of the truce, despatched
</p>
<p>a remonstrance to the English Court, but the af-
</p>
<p>fair was suffered to pass without farther notice ;
</p>
<p>and there is every reason to conclude, that Ogle
</p>
<p>acted according to some secret instructions he had
</p>
<p>received from the English Council. *
</p>
<p> This affair is differently narrated by our historians,
</p>
<p>and the inroad has been greatly magnified. See Duff's
</p>
<p>History of Scotland, folio, p. 59; Maitland's History,

<p>ness to magnify slight skirmishes, as if they were great
</p>
<p>battles, which constitute some of the difficulties in Scot-
</p>

</p>
<p>mand of Percy, Earl of Northumberland ; and there is

</p>
<p>The cause of this infringement of the truce was
</p>
<p>the conduct of James with respect to France, with
</p>
<p>which country the English were at war. The
</p>
<p>Maid of Orleans was then pursuing her successful
</p>
<p>career, and the English armies had been more than
</p>
<p>opce defeated by a woman. James had contract-
</p>
<p>ed his daughter, the Princess Margaret, to the
</p>
<p>Dauphin  an alliance which alarmed tlie English
</p>
<p>Government. But no direct violation of the truce
</p>
<p>between England and Scotland had taken place
</p>
<p>till 1435, which was destined to be followed by
</p>
<p>another wanton provocation in 1436. The Dau-
</p>
<p>phin had then attained his thirteenth year, and the
</p>
<p>Scottish Princess her twelfth ; and it was accord-
</p>
<p>ingly resolved to conclude the marriage. Henry
</p>
<p>of England beheld this connection with increased ir-
</p>
<p>ritation, more especially as James had rejected an
</p>
<p>alliance he had himself proposed in a special em-
</p>
<p>cuss the absurdity of this ludicrous attempt to magnify an
</p>
<p>inroad, which.wasraade merely to harass James in his pre-
</p>
<p>parations to send his daughter to France, with which country
</p>
<p>the English were then at war. Bowar, vol. ii. p. 500,
</p>
<p>has set the matter right ; and even Abercromby observes,
</p>
<p>that some writers say, the number of the prisoners amount-
</p>
<p>ed only to 1500, and that of the slain on both sides to 40
</p>
<p>or 200 at most. The fact that Sir Robert Ogle command-
</p>
<p>ed, and the date of this inroad, are ascertained from the
</p>
<p>correspondence of James and Henry on the subject, nar-

</p>
<p>iiintr of the year 1486, two French envoys arrived
</p>
<p>in Scotland to betroth the Princess ; and she was
</p>
<p>sont to France, escorted by an honourable retinue,
</p>
<p>conducted by the Earl of Orkney and the Bishop
</p>
<p>of Brechin. Sixteen knights and squires, forty
</p>
<p>ladies of noble parentage, and 140 gentlemen, *
</p>
<p>completed the gallant train, guarded by 1000 arm-
</p>
<p>ed men, in three galleys, and six well-manned bar-
</p>
<p>ges. The English Government, however, were
</p>
<p>on the watch ; 180 vessels lay in the Channel to
</p>
<p>intercept the Scottish Princess ; and captured she
</p>
<p>would have been, had not the English fleet at-
</p>
<p>tacked a number of Flemish merchant ships, and
</p>
<p>afterwards engaged with some Spanish vessels,
</p>
<p>which suddenly appeared, and deprived them of
</p>
<p>their Flemish prizes. The Scottish fleet escaped
</p>
<p>during these contests, and safely landed the Prin-
</p>
<p>cess at Rochelle, whence she proceeded to Paris.
</p>
<p>When James heard this additional insult offered
</p>
<p>him by the English, he did not long hesitate about
</p>
<p>retaliation ; yet it must be confessed, that, if the
</p>
<p>English were the first actual aggressors, the con-
</p>
<p>duct of James was not altogether free from blame,
</p>
<p>inasmuch as he had actually sent troops to France,
</p>
<p>to assist the French armies against their English
</p>
<p>enemies. The delay of redress, however, for the
</p>
<p>inroad under Ogle, the attempt to intercept his
</p>
<p>daughter, and probably a desire to prevent any
</p>
<p>treasonable confederacies among his nobility,
</p>
<p>prompted James to undertake a war against Eng-

</p>
<p>numerous army ; and it is remavkahie, that Scot-
</p>
<p>land, at all tinxiS limited in her resources, should
</p>
<p>have been able in those times to have sent so
</p>
<p>many men into the field,  a circumstance which
</p>
<p>can only, perhaps, be accounted for from the state
</p>
<p>of the kingdom, the limited extent of its merchan-
</p>
<p>dise and intercourse with foreign nations, and the
</p>
<p>nature of the tenures under which the peasantry
</p>
<p>held their limited property. The military array
</p>
<p>of James on this occasion consisted of nearly
</p>
<p>5^00,000 men, many of them mounted on horses,
</p>
<p>and a vast number of foot soldiers and followers of
</p>
<p>the army. This unwieldy assemblage, however,
</p>
<p>chiefly formidable on account of its numerical
</p>
<p>strength, was ill-armed and without discipline,
</p>
<p>composed generally of men who were courageous
</p>
<p>and savage enough in their own peculiar mode of
</p>
<p>warfare, but totally unfit to endure a campaign
</p>
<p>against a less numerous but well-disciplined force.
</p>
<p>The castle of Roxburgh, so fatal to James' son
</p>
<p>and successor, had been for a considerable time
</p>
<p>in the possession of the English,  a cause of
</p>
<p>no inconsiderable uneasiness to the Scottish mo-
</p>
<p>narchs. Situated on an eminence near the con-
</p>
<p>fluence of the Tweed and the Teviot, it had been
</p>
<p>always deemed a place of great importance ; and
</p>
<p>the vicissitudes it had undergone in former reigns
</p>
<p>made it at length be deemed, in a manner, the
</p>
<p>commanding fortress on the Borders. The reco-
</p>
<p>very of this fortress, then held for the English
</p>
<p>monarch by Sir Ralph Gray, was the primary ob-
</p>
<p>ject of James, and against it he led his unwieldy
</p>
<p>army in person. The King sat down before it

</p>
<p>and began the assault without success. For fifteen
</p>
<p>days, the valiant governor of the castle kept the
</p>
<p>24 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>Scottish force at bay ; and tlie King was at length
</p>
<p>compelled to al)andon the siege, dismiss his army,
</p>
<p>and return unsuccessful.
</p>
<p>The causes of this sudden movement and re-
</p>
<p>treat of James are variously related by historians.
</p>
<p>With a vanity which is too often apparent among
</p>
<p>our early writers, they have generally asserted,
</p>
<p>that the castle of Roxburgh was almost recovered
</p>
<p>by James, notwithstanding the bravery of Gray the
</p>
<p>governor, when the Queen arrived suddenly at the
</p>
<p>camp, with tidings of a formidable conspiracy
</p>
<p>formed against him. Insinuations are even made
</p>
<p>against the Queen, that it was a mere pretence on
</p>
<p>her part, as she was disposed to favour her coun-
</p>
<p>trymen the English. The King, according to
</p>
<p>these writers, suddenly raised the siege, fearing
</p>
<p>the reality of the plot, and that the officers of his
</p>
<p>army had been corrupted by English gold ; and
</p>
<p>betook himself to Perth, that he might investigate
</p>
<p>the conspiracy. But these accounts seem to have
</p>
<p>originated solely in the melancholy events which
</p>
<p>marked the termination of James's life the following
</p>
<p>year. That there was a conspiracy existing against
</p>
<p>him, we shall presently see ; and it is probable that
</p>
<p>the Queen may have heard who were the principal
</p>
<p>leaders. But the narrative of Walter Bowar, the
</p>
<p>monastic historian, who lived at the period, at once
</p>
<p>explains the causes of James' sudden retreat. Had
</p>
<p>there been a conspiracy, such as is vaguely reported
</p>
<p>by later writers on no authority, James was much
</p>
<p>safer with his army than after its dispersion ; but
</p>
<p>the King appears to have been convinced, that he
</p>
<p>was weakening his kingdom by supporting this

</p>
<p>successors ])rocee(led to violent extreuu's, and too
</p>
<p>often induced them to sacrifice their country to a
</p>
<p>gratification of their resentments.
</p>
<p>After the army was disbanded, James retired
</p>
<p>to Perth, where the court was then held. The
</p>
<p>Dominican or Blackfriars' Monastery, founded
</p>
<p>in 1231 by Alexander II., was the royal resi-
</p>
<p>dence,  a monastery of gieat splendour, sacrile-
</p>
<p>giously plundered and destroyed by the enthusiasts
</p>
<p>of the Reformation. This monastery, no trace of
</p>
<p>which now remains, was situated in the street still
</p>
<p>called the Blackfriars' Wynd ; and from the man-
</p>
<p>ner in which it is mentioned, and the frequent
</p>
<p>allusions made to it by our historians, it appears
</p>
<p>to have been a magnificent fabric of Gothic splen-
</p>
<p>dour. It became the residence of the sovereigns
</p>
<p>when the court was kept at Perth, after the de-
</p>
<p>molition of the Castle, (the site of which was
</p>
<p>towards the north end of the narrow street called
</p>
<p>the Skinnergate), in the Church of the monastery
</p>
<p>several parliaments were held ; and it was always
</p>
<p>the place where the national ecclesiastical councils
</p>
<p>assembled. But it is necessary to introduce the

</p>
<p>Sir Robert Graham, uncle of Malise Earl of
</p>
<p>Stiathern, had been imprisoned by James in 1425,
</p>
<p>when he took his summary vengeance on the fa-
</p>
<p>mily of Albany; but the cause, unless he had
</p>
<p>been connected with the practices of Albany, is
</p>
<p>not accurately known. In the Parliament, held

<p>in 1424, a statute was enacted to ascertain the
</p>
<p>lands which belonged to the crown at the de-
</p>
<p>cease of Robert I., and James was authorized to
</p>
<p>call for the production of all charters and writs
</p>
<p>of tenure. While thus engaged, James turned his
</p>
<p>attention to the earldom of Strathern ; and, under
</p>
<p>the pretence that it was a male fee, two years af-
</p>
<p>terwards he divested Malise of the earldom, and
</p>
<p>gave it to his own uncle, Walter Earl of Athol

<p>and Caithness, grand-uncle to the same Malise,

<p>for his liferent. As a recompense to the latter

</p>
<p>Menteith, by wliich distinction his family was af-
</p>
<p>terwards known in tlie peerage.
</p>
<p>Sir Robert Graliam, whose hatred to the King
</p>
<p>was inveterate, beheld not this divestment of his
</p>
<p>nephew's dignity without indignation ; yet it can
</p>
<p>hardly be conceived that this alone could stimulate
</p>
<p>him to murder his sovereign. Whatever were his
</p>
<p>motives, his dissimulation induced him to intrigue
</p>
<p>with Athol, who was not without ambition, though
</p>
<p>it is not likely that Graham was at all inclined to
</p>
<p>aid it, from the circumstances above narrated. Athol,
</p>
<p>at this period approaching his seventieth year, was
</p>
<p>the second son of Robert II., by Euphemia Ross,
</p>
<p>the second queen of that monarch. His grandson,
</p>
<p>Sir Robert Stuart, was in high favour with James,
</p>
<p>and held the office of private chamberlain in the
</p>
<p>court. These were the two noblemen on whom
</p>
<p>Graham practised, captivating the dotage of age,
</p>
<p>and the inexperience of youth, to promote his own
</p>
<p>desperate revenge. His audacity equalled his dis-
</p>
<p>simulation. It was pretended by him and his as-
</p>
<p>sociates, that after the King was despatched, the
</p>
<p>crown would be given to Sir Robert Stuart; 
</p>
<p>the latter thus dazzled by the prospect of a throne,
</p>
<p>and Athol his grandfather no less attracted by the
</p>
<p>hopes and allurements of seeing his family elevated
</p>
<p>to the regal dignity.
</p>
<p>Graham soon found a number of desperate ad-
</p>
<p>herents in this conspiracy ; and after his plan was
</p>
<p>matured, every action of the King was interpreted
</p>
<p>in the severest manner. He made it his business
</p>
<p>to inflame the people by false representations of
</p>
<p>the King's proceedings, while he fomented the dis-

</p>
<p>ficiently dissatisfied at the King's successful at-
</p>
<p>tempts to diminish their power and influence.
</p>
<p>In 1434, shortly after Graham had heen releas-
</p>
<p>ed from his imprisonment, a meeting of the prin-
</p>
<p>cipal nobility was held, most probably to con-
</p>
<p>sider the intentions of James, who was then pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding vigorously in his plans to humble their feu-
</p>
<p>dal greatness. At this meeting Graham attend-
</p>
<p>ed ; and, irritated by his confinement, his conduct
</p>
<p>was as outrageous as his language was inflamma-
</p>
<p>tory. It was maintained, that the execution of Al-
</p>
<p>bany and hie sons had originated in the insatiable
</p>
<p>avarice of the King to possess their estates ; and
</p>
<p>no measured language was employed to express
</p>
<p>the greedy covetousness, by which, it was alleged,
</p>
<p>James oppressed and impoverished the kingdom.

<p>long harangue, " if you will firmly support me in
</p>
<p>what I shall say to the King, I shall demand redress
</p>
<p>in your presence, and I trust in God we shall be
</p>
<p>satisfied. " As he was a man of eloquence, and
</p>
<p>skilled in the laws as they then stood, Graham's
</p>
<p>proposal was readily assented to, and the nobles
</p>
<p>present bound themselves to support him.
</p>
<p>The next Parliament was the time fixed for the
</p>
<p>accomplishment of this plan, and Graham in the
</p>
<p>meanwhile had not been idle. It met in 1485,
</p>
<p>and Graham, relying on the promises he had
</p>
<p>received of support, conducted himself with the
</p>
<p>most extravagant audacity. Exceeding the bounds
</p>
<p>of his commission, he rose with a furious counte-
</p>
<p>nance, and, advancing to the throne, he pre-
</p>
<p>sumptuously laid his hand on the King, and ex-

<p>claimed, " I arrest you in the name of the three
</p>
<p>estates of your realm, now assembled in this present
</p>
<p>I. ASSASSINATION OF JAMES I. 29
</p>
<p>Parliainent ; for, as your subjects are bound and
</p>
<p>sworn to obey you in the administration of the
</p>
<p>laws, in like manner you are compelled to defend
</p>
<p>your people, to govern by the laws, so that ye do
</p>
<p>not wrong them, but defend and maintain them in
</p>
<p>justice. " Then turning to the assembled peers,
</p>
<p>he cried, " Is it not thus as I say ? " But they,
</p>
<p>astonished at his boldness, and awed, perhaps, by
</p>
<p>the presence of their sovereign, kept profound
</p>
<p>silence, not venturing to appear as the abettors of
</p>
<p>this daring action. The King immediately ordered
</p>
<p>Graham to prison, who, exasperated at seeing him-
</p>
<p>self deserted by those who had pledged their sup-
</p>
<p>port, retorted a severe sarcasm as he was led out
</p>
<p>in custody :  " He that serveth a common man,
</p>
<p>serveth only during bis convenience. "
</p>
<p>It does not appear that James endeavoured to
</p>
<p>ascertain who were the associates of Graham pre-
</p>
<p>paratory to this exploit, but it farther confirmed
</p>
<p>him in his resolution to crush the power of the no-
</p>
<p>bility. Graham was soon after ordered into ba-
</p>
<p>nishment, and he retired to the fastnesses of the
</p>
<p>Highlands, revolving in his mind dark and des-
</p>
<p>perate designs. As his estates were forfeited to
</p>
<p>the crown, he proceeded to renounce his allegi-
</p>
<p>ance, and sent the King a mortal defiance, declar-
</p>
<p>ing that for his tyranny he would destroy him,
</p>
<p>his wife, and children, and slay him with his own
</p>
<p>hands, whenever he had opportunity. This de-
</p>
<p>fiance drew forth a proclamation from James, oflFer-
</p>
<p>ing a reward of three thousand deniers of gold, each
</p>
<p>piece worth half a noble of English money, to any

</p>
<p>But, nothing daunted by this proclamation, this
</p>
<p>audacious rebel was not idle. He took advan-
</p>
<p>tage of the King's absence at Roxburgh Castle, to
</p>
<p>correspond with some of the nobles ; and he vo-
</p>
<p>luntarily offered to assassinate James, and place
</p>
<p>the crown on the head of Robert Stuart, Athol's
</p>
<p>grandson. It was probably, after all, a report of
</p>
<p>Graham's conduct, which induced the Queen to
</p>
<p>depart with such precipitancy for the camp at
</p>
<p>Roxburgh ; but there is no evidence to suppose
</p>
<p>that it caused James to raise the siege, as he was
</p>
<p>previously well aware of the inveterate hatred of
</p>
<p>this daring offender.
</p>
<p>Athol and his grandson, however, had ere this
</p>
<p>time engaged in the conspiracy ; and it is said the
</p>
<p>former was the more inclined, from the prediction
</p>
<p>of a Highland seer whom he had consulted in the
</p>
<p>district of Athol, that, " before his death, he would
</p>
<p>be crowned before a great concourse of people. "
</p>
<p>The last parliament of James met at Edinburgh
</p>
<p>on the festival of All-Hallowmas, 1436, when the
</p>
<p>bold and ferocious Graham, though an exile and a
</p>
<p>rebel, exerted himself with more than ordinary
</p>
<p>activity. He sent private messages to certain re-
</p>
<p>tainers of the late Duke of Albany, again offering
</p>
<p>to slay the King, and place Sir Robert Stuart on
</p>
<p>the throne. By this means a few were drawn over
</p>
<p>to the party, but the chief conspirators were Gra-
</p>
<p>ham himself, Athol, Sir Robert Stuart, and a do-
</p>
<p>mestic of the King's, whom they had bribed for
</p>
<p>the purpose, and from whom they received inti'
</p>
<p>mations of James' movements.

</p>
<p>ing feetivBl of Christmas. If we are to believe
</p>
<p>the popular historians and chroniclers of the times,
</p>
<p>many supernatural indications were given of
</p>
<p>James' approaching fate. In 1436, towards the
</p>
<p>end of that year, Sir James Balfour notes, that a
</p>
<p>fearful comet, like a fiery sword, was seen in the
</p>
<p>heavens, as if between Edinburgh and Perth ; *
</p>
<p>and the same author gravely observes, that this
</p>
<p>year in Perth a sow brought forth a dog. A fear-
</p>
<p>ful eclipse also, it is said, lasted for three hours,
</p>
<p>during which it was as dark as midnight ; and
</p>
<p>these hours were long remembered in Scotland as
</p>
<p>the black Jiours. As a remarkable prodigy, we are
</p>
<p>informed, that the frost was so intense that winter,
</p>
<p>as to cause ale and wine to be sold by weight,
</p>
<p>being frozen into a solid substance. Two of the
</p>
<p>most ridiculous traditions, doubtless an improve-
</p>
<p>ment on some of the former, are, that a calf was
</p>
<p>seen with a head exactly shaped like that of a
</p>
<p>horse, and a sow littered pigs with dogs' heads.
</p>
<p>Absurd as these traditions are, they were most re-
</p>
<p>ligiously believed by the Scots of that age after
</p>
<p>the King's death, as so many indications from
</p>
<p>heaven of his approaching fate.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the conspirators were proceeding
</p>
<p>with caution ; their plan was completely matured,
</p>
<p>the opportunity only being wanting to perpetrate
</p>
<p>the diabolical deed. Yet their caution was not
</p>
<p>80 great as to prevent some vague rumours of their
</p>
<p>intentions to spread abroad ; and these rumours
</p>
<p>had reached even the most intimate domestics in

<p>the river Tay. " My Lord Kinir, " she cried with
</p>
<p>a loud voice, " if you pass over this water, you
</p>
<p>shall never return again alive. " James was star-
</p>
<p>tled at her language, more especially as at that
</p>
<p>moment an old prophecy occurred to his mind,
</p>
<p>that a King of Scotland was to be slain that year.
</p>
<p>He commanded one of his attendants to ride up
</p>
<p>to the woman, and ask the meaning of her dubious
</p>
<p>exclamation ; but to this messenger she merely re-
</p>
<p>peated what she had before said to the King, per-
</p>
<p>sisting in her declaration, that if he passed that
</p>
<p>stream, he would never return alive. He asked
</p>
<p>her how she knew that ; to which she replied,
</p>
<p>that she had received her information from a per-
</p>
<p>son named Hubert, most probably a domestic of
</p>
<p>the palace. Whether or not the attendant was in
</p>
<p>the plot, is doubtful ; he treated the prediction of
</p>
<p>the woman with contempt. " Sire, " said he to
</p>
<p>James, " men would smile if your Majesty re-
</p>
<p>garded yon woman's language, for she is nought
</p>
<p>but a drunken fool, and knows not what she says."
</p>
<p>The monarch and his attendants passed on, and
</p>
<p>entered Perth, where the celebration of the festi-
</p>
<p>val of Christmas commenced.
</p>
<p>Many were the omens which were observed of
</p>
<p>the King's approaching fate, and many are the popu-
</p>
<p>lar traditions recorded ; but the observation of Pin-
</p>
<p>kerton is too true, that " the worst omen was his
</p>
<p>rigorous administration, which had created many
</p>
<p>enemies, among whom the conspiracy spread like
</p>
<p>a fire among combustible materials. " The monas-

<p>and the scene of his last and fatal revelry.
</p>
<p>That maanificent edifice, thus destined to be the
</p>
<p>I. ASSASSINATION OF JAMES I. 35
</p>
<p>scene of a most horrible tragedy, was on this occa-
</p>
<p>sion honoured by a brilliant assemblage of Scottish
</p>
<p>beauty, and bright eyes were tliere mixing in the
</p>
<p>dance and gracing the tournament, which ere long
</p>
<p>were to be suffused with tears. The Queen and
</p>
<p>Ler ladies resided in the monastery, and James,
</p>
<p>unconscious of his fate, moved among them  the
</p>
<p>gay, the gallant, the accomplished monarch. The
</p>
<p>sacred services of the Church were concluded, and
</p>
<p>the Court was the scene of festal gaiety. One of
</p>
<p>the attendant knights, remarkable for his personal
</p>
<p>accomplishments, received the epithet of King of
</p>
<p>Love from James. With him the King was one
</p>
<p>evening playing at chess, when he indulged in some
</p>
<p>sportive satire on his new title. " Sir King of Love, "
</p>
<p>said James, " it is not long since I read a pro-
</p>
<p>phecy, spoken some time ago, which set forth,
</p>
<p>that this year a king should be slain in this land,
</p>
<p>and well ye wot. Sir Alexander, there are no
</p>
<p>Kings in this realm but you and I ; and therefore I
</p>
<p>counsell you that ye be wary ; for I let you know
</p>
<p>that, under God, I shall take care of my own safe-
</p>
<p>ty sufficiently, being under your Kingship, and in
</p>
<p>the service of Love. "
</p>
<p>If our chroniclers are to be credited, other po-
</p>
<p>pular stories strikingly illustrate the influence
</p>
<p>of superstitious impressions, as also the fatal se-
</p>
<p>curity in which James imagined himself. Short-
</p>
<p>ly after the above circumstance, the King was in
</p>
<p>his own apartment, conversing with some ladies
</p>
<p>and nobles on various subjects. A squire, a fa-
</p>
<p>vourite of the King, drew near, and said, " In

<p>sooth, my Lord, I verily dreamed to-night that

</p>
<p>Sir Robert Graham had slain your ^Majesty. " It
</p>
<p>is not improbable, that this, under the pretence of
</p>
<p>36 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>its being a dream, was a timely hint to James of
</p>
<p>liis situation ; but be this as it may, the squire was
</p>
<p>sharply reproved by the Earl of Orkney, (the same
</p>
<p>nobleman who founded the magnificent chapel at
</p>
<p>Roslin near Edinburgh), who commanded him to
</p>
<p>liold his peace, and tell no such idle tales in the
</p>
<p>royal presence. Yet it made some impression on
</p>
<p>James, who immediately recollected a dream of
</p>
<p>his own, in which he thought a serpent and a toad
</p>
<p>furiously assailed him in his own private apart-
</p>
<p>ments, and that he had nothing to defend himself
</p>
<p>against them but a pair of tongs he found in the
</p>
<p>chimney. The other signs and omens our chro-
</p>
<p>nicler has not narrated ; but yet, so great was the
</p>
<p>reverence which the presence of the devoted mo-
</p>
<p>narch excited, that thrice did Christopher Cham-
</p>
<p>bers, the domestic whom the conspirators had
</p>
<p>bribed, and who had formerly been a retainer of
</p>
<p>the Duke of Albany, attempt to approach the
</p>
<p>King, and make a full disclosure of the conspira-
</p>
<p>cy, and as often did he fail, from a want of reso-
</p>
<p>lution, accident, or a sense of pity towards his asso-
</p>
<p>ciates. The unhappy monarch was devoted to
</p>
<p>destruction.
</p>
<p>At length a night was fixed for the accomplish-
</p>
<p>ment of the conspiracy, and the first Wednesday in
</p>
<p>Lent 1437, was the night destined for its execution
</p>
<p>by the conspirators, being the night between the 20th
</p>
<p>and 21st of February. The leaders of the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy had previously met ; Graham had private-

<p>I have made to you all, founded on the strongest

<p>grounds of consanguinity, friendship, and resolu-
</p>
<p>tion to revenge our mutual wrongs, move me free-
</p>
<p>ly to reveal my secret intentions, and to disclose
</p>
<p>my hidden purposes and counsels. The tragedies
</p>
<p>which have been acted in the state since the first ar-
</p>
<p>rival of this Englishman at the crown, are to none
</p>
<p>of you unknown. Murdac and his children have
</p>
<p>been beheaded ; the Earl of Lennox, the father-
</p>
<p>in-law of Murdac, came to the same end ; the no-
</p>
<p>bles repine at the government of the King ; the
</p>
<p>King is jealous of his nobles ; and the people are
</p>
<p>on the eve of rebellion. These have all been the
</p>
<p>effects of my crafty policy, and hitherto they have
</p>
<p>happened as fortunately as they were ingeniously
</p>
<p>contrived. For what more ingenious and cun-

<p>ning stratagem could be devised to overthrow the
</p>
<p>prosperity of these usurpers, than to get them des-

<p>myself as judge in Albany's case, easily did I pro-

<p>cure summary vengeance for the crimes of his

<p>by descent of blood from liobert IL, my father, was
</p>
<p>in the person of David, my brother, and is now just-
</p>
<p>ly claimed by me and my nephew. And though

<p>who now- occupy the throne, yet no parliament-

<p>for a time such acts and oaths have prevailed, yet,

<p>if our designs be successful, we shall have a Par-

<p>liament approving our right, abolishing the autho-

<p>ers. This one man and child taken off, if perad-

<p>there were, the only remedies of present dangera

<p>him wltich he knows right well he deserveth. Let
</p>
<p>us, then, resolve his douhts ; our purposes are
</p>
<p>honour and revenge ; our feelings towards him are
</p>
<p>mutual. The very heavens seem to favour us,
</p>
<p>having induced him to dismiss his army, and to
</p>
<p>come to the very place where our designs must suc-
</p>
<p>ceed. Let us rather follow these advantageous cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances, trusting more to that propitious fortune
</p>
<p>which ever favours great actions, than to that effe-
</p>
<p>minate virtue which preacheth cowardly patience ;
</p>
<p>remembering, that the fairest representations of va-
</p>
<p>lour have been given to the foulest deeds, and that
</p>
<p>the most powerful families thence derive their
</p>
<p>greatness, chance seldom or never following vic-

</p>
<p>was sovereignty at first but u violent usurpation of
</p>
<p>the stronjjer over the weaker? Great enterprises
</p>
<p>must begin with danger, but end with rewards.
</p>
<p>Death should rather be prevented than expected,
</p>
<p>but it were more honourable to die at once, than
</p>
<p>to prolong a miserable life, subject to the scorn of
</p>
<p>other men's pride. Let us be resolute in our plot,
</p>
<p>and hazard the enterprise. The worst that can be-
</p>
<p>fall us, since we cannot exist while the usurper is
</p>
<p>alive, is, that he be taken away while we run the ha-
</p>
<p>zard of death, which, however^ happeneth to all
</p>
<p>men equally, with the difference only of fame or
</p>
<p>oblivion with posterity, which ariseth out of an
</p>
<p>evil action as well as out of a good, if the action

<p>and attempt be alike great. Now, then, is the

<p>of the conspirators. The eventful night, however,
</p>
<p>at length arrived, which was to consummate the
</p>
<p>40 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>tragedy. Graliam was lurking in the neighbour-
</p>
<p>hood of the Dominican Convent, occasionally re-
</p>
<p>ceiving information of the proceedings within from
</p>
<p>the perfidious domestic. Athol and his grandson
</p>
<p>were at the court that evening, and the time was
</p>
<p>spent in more than ordinary hilarity, in playing at
</p>
<p>chess, reading, singing, piping, playing on instru-
</p>
<p>ments, and other amusements, both before and
</p>
<p>after supper. During the prolongation of these
</p>
<p>recreations, the woman who had before warned
</p>
<p>James of his fate, while on his journey from Edin-
</p>
<p>burgh to Perth, appeared at the gate of the Do-
</p>
<p>minican Convent. She had followed the court to
</p>
<p>Perth, and knew that this was the night fixed for
</p>
<p>the execution of the conspiracy, from the numbers
</p>
<p>of armed men lurking in the vicinity of the town.
</p>
<p>She entered the court of the Convent, and crossed
</p>
<p>to that side of the building which contained the
</p>
<p>royal apartments. Having found the door, she
</p>
<p>designed to force her way into the King's pre-
</p>
<p>sence, but it was shut. She knocked till the door
</p>
<p>was opened by a domestic, who demanded her
</p>
<p>business at that advanced hour in the evening.
</p>
<p>" Let me in, " said she, " for I have something
</p>
<p>to say, and to tell to the King. I am the same
</p>
<p>woman that not long ago desired to have spoken
</p>
<p>with him when about to enter Perth. " The ap-
</p>
<p>parent earnestness of the woman astonished the
</p>
<p>domestic, and he proceeded to inform the King.
</p>
<p>Tliinking, however, that it was some frivolous
</p>
<p>affair, James was not inclined to relinquish his
</p>
<p>amusements, and simply said, " Let her come to-
</p>
<p>morrow. " Wlien this was told to the woman,

</p>
<p>she sorrowfully replied, " Well, it will repent you-
</p>
<p>all, that you will not let me speak now with the
</p>
<p>I. ASSASSINATION OF JAMES I. 41
</p>
<p>King. " This called forth a jest from the domes-
</p>
<p>tic, and she departed.
</p>
<p>The amusements of the Court were kept up to
</p>
<p>a late hour. After supper, James called for the
</p>
<p>parting-cup, and every one present drank before
</p>
<p>retiring to rest. Stuart, Athol's grandson, was
</p>
<p>the last who left the King, and he left the door of
</p>
<p>the apartment open  a precaution indeed needless,
</p>
<p>as he had previously destroyed the locks. It would
</p>
<p>appear that a door from the apartments opened
</p>
<p>into a garden ; for about midnight the conspirators
</p>
<p>had laid down planks of wood, and hurdles, by
</p>
<p>which they might be able to get over the ditch
</p>
<p>which surrounded the garden near the outer wall.
</p>
<p>By this way the conspirators entered the convent ;
</p>
<p>and shortly after midnight, when the Court had
</p>
<p>retired to rest, Graham, with three hundred High-
</p>
<p>landers, was in possession of the house, having
</p>
<p>effected his entiance without being observed, or
</p>
<p>meeting with the slightest interruption.
</p>
<p>James had retired to his own apartment, and
</p>
<p>was standing before the fire-place in a kind of un-
</p>
<p>dress, gaily conversing with his Queen and her
</p>
<p>ladies, when suddenly he heard a loud noise in the
</p>
<p>court, as if the clashing of armour and armed men,
</p>
<p>and the gloomy flash of torches glared from with-
</p>
<p>out through the room. Immediately the suspi-
</p>
<p>cions of treason occurred to him ; the warnings he
</p>
<p>had received revived in his mind; and his thoughts
</p>
<p>naturally reverted to the dark and gloomy exile
</p>
<p>who had insulted him by his mortal defiance.
</p>
<p>Astonishment and terror were depicted on the
</p>
<p>countenances of the ladies ; and, as the noise wax-

</p>
<p>King. Recovering, liowever, their composure for
</p>
<p>a moment, tlie Queen and the ladies rushed to the
</p>
<p>door, which they found open, and the holts de-
</p>
<p>stroyed. The imhappy prince, without arms or
</p>
<p>attendants, hesought them to keep fast the door as
</p>
<p>well as they could, while he looked round to see
</p>
<p>if escape were practicable. He ran to the win-
</p>
<p>dows, hut found them so strongly barred without,
</p>
<p>as utterly to preclude any possibility of escape by
</p>
<p>them ; nor had he time to effect it, even had it been
</p>
<p>practicable, as the tumult and clashing of armour
</p>
<p>every moment increased. Heavy footsteps were
</p>
<p>already heard along the gallery which led to the
</p>
<p>King's apartment, and the violence from without
</p>
<p>already indicated the designs of the assailants.
</p>
<p>The unhappy King, finding it impossible to
</p>
<p>escape by the windows, seized the fire-tongs, and,
</p>
<p>by a desperate exertion, succeeded in wrenching a
</p>
<p>plank from the floor, which covered a kind of square
</p>
<p>vault or cellar of trifling dimensions. Through this
</p>
<p>aperture he dropped himself, and covered himself
</p>
<p>with the plank. He was now in one of those dis-
</p>
<p>agreeable places often found in old houses, a place,
</p>
<p>indeed, full of ordure and filth, but still he could
</p>
<p>not escape outwardly, for, by a sad fatality, he had
</p>
<p>caused the aperture, or small square window,
</p>
<p>which had been formerly used for cleansing the
</p>
<p>place, and through which he could have easily
</p>
<p>escaped, to be built up three days before, because
</p>
<p>the tennis-balls were apt to enter it when that
</p>
<p>game was played in the garden. Yet even in this
</p>
<p>place the King might, perhaps, have been safe,
</p>
<p>had his own impatience not betrayed him.

<p>As soon as the conspirators had got possession
</p>
<p>of the Convent, it was, of course, their first object
</p>
<p>I. ASSASSINATION OF JAMES I. 43
</p>
<p>to make towards the KingVj apartment ; and tra-
</p>
<p>dition affirms, that they were nhown it by Sir Ro-
</p>
<p>bert Stuart, Atliol's t^randson, tlie same individual
</p>
<p>for whom James Iiad always entertained a special
</p>
<p>regard. A page, named Walter Straiton, who held
</p>
<p>the office of cup-bearer, and who was then in the
</p>
<p>act of carrying some wine for the King and Queen,
</p>
<p>first gave the alarm. He saw them consulting
</p>
<p>among themvselves, and instantly exclaiming, Trai-
</p>
<p>tors ! Traitors ! made haste to secure the door.
</p>
<p>The page, however, was stabbed to the heart by
</p>
<p>one of the conspirators, who simultaneously rush-
</p>
<p>ed towards the King's apartment with axes, swords,
</p>
<p>and other weapons. Yet his cries had wained the
</p>
<p>inmates of the royal apartments of the approach of
</p>
<p>the assassins. The King was at this time in the
</p>
<p>vault, or cellar, under the floor, and the ladies ran
</p>
<p>towards the outer door. The bolts, as lias been said,
</p>
<p>had been previously despoiled ; but one of the
</p>
<p>Maids of Honour, Lady Catherine Douglas, a lady
</p>
<p>of the house of Douglas, and afterwaids married
</p>
<p>to a knight named Alexander Lovel, performed an
</p>
<p>action of heroism, which is worthy of being known
</p>
<p>to latest posterity. This noble lady, with a cour-
</p>
<p>age beyond her age and sex, thrust her arm into
</p>
<p>the bolt, while the door was attempted to be se-
</p>
<p>cured within by the pressure of the other ladies.
</p>
<p>The delicate arm-bone, however, was in a moment
</p>
<p>broken to pieces by the violence of the assassins, who
</p>
<p>burst open the door, and scrupled not, while thus
</p>
<p>stimulated by their savage passions, to trample down
</p>
<p>and wound several of the fair defenders. The fierce
</p>
<p>appearance of the conspirators alarmed the helpless

<p>females, and they fled from tliem with loud cries of
</p>
<p>terror and lamentation. Several attendants, whom

</p>
<p>the noise had called together, and who endeavoured
</p>
<p>to resist, were slain, and among these fell Patrick
</p>
<p>Dunbar, a brother of the Earl of March. Shrieking
</p>
<p>with horror, the ladies fled, and the conspirators
</p>
<p>rushed into the apartment under which the King
</p>
<p>was concealed. They found the Queen speechless
</p>
<p>and aghast at the horrid scene, and incapable of
</p>
<p>even imploring protection. A villain wounded her,
</p>
<p>and would probably have murdered her on the
</p>
<p>spot, had not a son of Sir Robert Graham inter-
</p>
<p>posed, exclaiming, "What! shame on yourself!
</p>
<p>What will you do to the Queen ? She is but a wo-
</p>
<p>man. Let us go and seeU the King." Leaving
</p>
<p>the princess in that deplorable condition, with her
</p>
<p>hair dishevelled, and her dress, from their rudeness,
</p>
<p>hanging loose about her, while the ladies remained
</p>
<p>lost in tears and astonishment, the traitors pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to search every corner of the apartment.
</p>
<p>But their search was in vain ; and it is remark-
</p>
<p>able that they never recollected the cellar, or vault,
</p>
<p>below the floor. Having examined every corner
</p>
<p>without success, some of them proceeded to the
</p>
<p>one adjoining, while others extended the search
</p>
<p>to more remote apartments. Every place was
</p>
<p>diligently explored,  *' in the litters, undir the
</p>
<p>presses, the fourmes, the chares, and all othir places,
</p>
<p>long they besily sought the Kyng." At length a
</p>
<p>temporary quietness ensued, when the King, think-
</p>
<p>ing the conspirators were gone, called for sheets
</p>
<p>to draw him out of the nauseous place of his con-
</p>
<p>cealment. The ladies with considerable exertion
</p>
<p>removed the plank, and were proceeding to extri-
</p>
<p>cate the King, when one of them, Elizabeth Doug-

</p>
<p>las, fell down into the place. At this unfortunate
</p>
<p>moment, Christopher Chambers, one of the assas-
</p>
<p>I. ASSASSINATION OF JAxMES I. 45
</p>
<p>sins, recollecting the vault, or cellar, concluded,
</p>
<p>that aa the King was not found in any of the
</p>
<p>apartments, he would most likely he there con-
</p>
<p>cealed. " Sirs," said he to his associates, " where-
</p>
<p>fore stand we thus idle, and lose our time, when
</p>
<p>the object of our search is hid ? Come on with
</p>
<p>me, and I shall soon discover where the King is."
</p>
<p>He entered the apartment with a torch, and though
</p>
<p>the noise of their appioach had caused the ladies
</p>
<p>hastily to replace the board, he proceeded to a
</p>
<p>careful examination of the floor. He soon per-
</p>
<p>ceived that a plank had been broken up, and lift-
</p>
<p>ing it, held the torch in the aperture, and beheld
</p>
<p>through the glare the King and the lady. " Sirs,"
</p>
<p>he exclaimed with ferocious exultation, " the bride
</p>
<p>is found, for whom we have been searching, and
</p>
<p>carolling all night long." This fatal discovery,
</p>
<p>which, without doubt, the King's own impatience
</p>
<p>caused, was no sooner known than the conspirators
</p>
<p>speedily assembled. A traitor, named Sir John
</p>
<p>Hall, instantly leaped into the cellar with a dagger
</p>
<p>in his hand. But the King grappled him by the
</p>
<p>shoulders, and dashed him witli violence on the
</p>
<p>ground. Another conspirator, a brother of Hall,
</p>
<p>descended, and made for the King, but the blow
</p>
<p>was parried ; and, being seized by the neck, he
</p>
<p>also was thrown down. So strong was the grasp
</p>
<p>of the King when he throttled these two assassins,
</p>
<p>tliat they retained the marks on their throats for a
</p>
<p>considerable time after. Yet in vain did James
</p>
<p>attempt to wrest a dagger from either. Although
</p>
<p>standing above them, and they almost stunned by
</p>
<p>the fall, they lu'ld fast their weapons ; and, in the

</p>
<p>defence. Had James succeeded in acquiring a
</p>
<p>dagger, he would not only have sold his life at the
</p>
<p>dearest rate, but in all probability, by parrying
</p>
<p>their attacks, he would have defended himself till
</p>
<p>the alarm had been sounded, and the people of the
</p>
<p>town assembled for his rescue in the monastery.
</p>
<p>But fate had ordered it otherwise. Graham,
</p>
<p>the King's implacable enemy, now entered the
</p>
<p>apartment, and descended into the wretched cellar.
</p>
<p>Weary and faint with his former sti-uggles, and
</p>
<p>also weaponless, James appealed to him for mer-
</p>
<p>cy, as further resistance was vain. But Graham,
</p>
<p>with ferocious exultation, raised his dagger, and
</p>
<p>pointed it towards the King's heart. " Thou cruel
</p>
<p>tyrant," said he, " never didst thou show mercy to
</p>
<p>those of thy own blood, nor to any other gentle-
</p>
<p>man, who came in thy way. No mercy shalt thou
</p>
<p>have now. " " Then, " replied the King, " I en-
</p>
<p>treat thee, for the salvation of my soul, to let me
</p>
<p>have a confessor. " " No, " said Graham, " no
</p>
<p>other confessor shalt thou have but this dagger."
</p>
<p>Thus saying, he plunged his weapon into the King's
</p>
<p>body. The unhappy monarch instantly fell with
</p>
<p>a fearful cry, imploring for mercy, and offering
</p>
<p>half his kingdom for his life. The assassin,
</p>
<p>struck with remorse for a moment, relented, and
</p>
<p>was about to withdraw without farther violence,
</p>
<p>when the other conspirators from above exclaim-
</p>
<p>ed, " We shall abide by thee faithfully, if thou
</p>
<p>slay him ; but if thou depart, we swear thou shalt
</p>
<p>die by our hands. " Immediately Graham, and

</p>
<p>of his time, in the forty-fourth year of his a^e, and
</p>
<p>thirty-first year of his nominal, though only the
</p>
<p>thirteenth of his actual reign. After murdering
</p>
<p>their sovereign, the infamous assassins, as if still
</p>
<p>unsatisfied with blood, sought the Queen, with
</p>
<p>the intention of murdering her also ; but she had
</p>
<p>escaped. Ttie alarm, however, was now given in
</p>
<p>the town ; and tlie citizens, with the King's ser-
</p>
<p>vants, rushed into the monastery, when it was too
</p>
<p>late, to defend their sovereign. The red glare of
</p>
<p>torches, and loud threats of vengeance, burst upon
</p>
<p>the midnight regicides, who, struck with dismay,
</p>
<p>now consulted their safety by flight in every direc-
</p>
<p>tion. They were instantly pursued by Sir David
</p>
<p>Dunbar, but without success. One of them lie

<p>slew, and wounded another ; but in this fighting

<p>pursuit, for by this time they were compelled to a

<p>defence, some of them turned on him with fury,

<p>and sorely wounded him. They effected their

<p>escape to the fastnesses of the Highlands, only

<p>regretting that they had not slain the Queen,

<p>It is not accurately known by what means the lead-
</p>
<p>ers of this atrocious conspiracy were apprehended.
</p>
<p>The united testimony of all our historians, how-
</p>
<p>ever, establishes the fact, that the King's murder
</p>
<p>excited great lamentation in the kingdom, and
</p>
<p>the most furious indignation against the con-
</p>
<p>spirators ; for even those with whom James was
</p>
<p>unpopular, and who were disposed to view his go-
</p>
<p>vernment as tyrannical, deplored their sovereign,
</p>
<p>and deemed the act execrable. So anxious were
</p>
<p>the people to bring the conspirators to justice, that
</p>
<p>every baron and chief in the kingdom united in
</p>
<p>endeavouring to apprehend them. Had this not
</p>
<p>been the case, it is probable that they might have
</p>
<p>eluded justice for a considerable time in the fast-
</p>
<p>nesses of the Highlands. They had good cause
</p>
<p>to fear the vengeance of the Queen. Within a
</p>
<p>month after the assassination, they were all taken

<p>and lodged in prison, when punishments were pre-
</p>
<p>pared for them, and a series of exquisite tortures
</p>
<p>devised, which, as refinements on human cruelty,
</p>
<p>excite, even at this distance of time, the involunta-
</p>
<p>ry shudder, and sufficiently denote the barharism
</p>
<p>of the age.
</p>
<p>The regicides who were first apprehended, were
</p>
<p>Sir Robert Stuart and Christopher Chambers.
</p>
<p>They were secured, it is said, by Robertson of
</p>
<p>Strowan  a fact extremely probable, as they botlj
</p>
<p>retreated after the assassination to that chief-
</p>
<p>tain's territories. * They were carried to Edin-
</p>
<p>burgh, and imprisoned in the Castle, whence they
</p>
<p>were speedily brought to trial, and condemned to
</p>
<p>be hanged, drawn, and quartered. The metropo-
</p>
<p>lis was destined to be the scene of the sufferings of
</p>
<p>some of the conspirators. For those two who were
</p>
<p>first brought to punishment, a scaffold was erect-
</p>
<p>ed in the principal street of the city, and a wood-
</p>
<p>en cross of considerable height was placed in the
</p>
<p>centre. To this cross they were both bound, al-
</p>
<p>most naked, amid a great concourse of spectators.
</p>
<p>The executioner stood before them with a pair of
</p>
<p>iron pinchers or tongs, with which he ever and
</p>
<p>anon twisted theii' bodies, and pulled off large
</p>
<p>pieces of their flesh in the most excruciating man-
</p>
<p>ner, while the blood gushed forth from the ghastly
</p>
<p>wounds. Yet they endured with great patience
</p>
<p>their torments ; and Sir Robert Stuart even said
</p>
<p>to the executioner, " Do whatsoever you please,
</p>
<p>for we have been guilty, and well deserve much
</p>
<p>more than this painful death." This wretched

<p>were soon after made to descend from the scattbld,
</p>
<p>and were led through the streets of Edinburgh, the
</p>
<p>same tortures heing all the way repeated by the
</p>
<p>executioner. They were then brought before the
</p>
<p>Guildry Hall or Council-House, which was situ-
</p>
<p>ated in the vicinity of St Giles' Church, and com-
</p>
<p>pelled to remount the scaflfold, where they stood
</p>
<p>nearly two hours a pul)lic spectacle. After this
</p>
<p>they were again carried through the city, till they
</p>
<p>came to a place where two high poles had been
</p>
<p>erected, with cross-beams, for some mechanical
</p>
<p>purpose. Here they were stopt, and the execu-
</p>
<p>tioner immediately tied ropes round about their
</p>
<p>breasts, below their shoulders, and suspended them
</p>
<p>in the air. While thus hanging, they made an
</p>
<p>open confession of their guilt ; Sir Robert Stu-
</p>
<p>art professing great penitence, but Christopher
</p>
<p>Chambers justifying the whole conspiracy, and the
</p>
<p>manner of the King's death. After being sus-
</p>
<p>pended for some time in this manner, they were
</p>
<p>both carried to the market-place, where Sir Ro-
</p>
<p>bert Stuart was drawn asunder by four horses ;
</p>
<p>his companion beheaded on a high scaffold, and
</p>
<p>then quartered. * Stuart's head was sent to Perth,

<p> This assertion is on the authoiity of Sir James Bal-

</p>
<p>it is traditionary. It is proper to mention, however, that
</p>
<p>the other authorities state simply that Stuart was beheaded
</p>

</p>

<p>and placed on the top of the town-jail ; the head
</p>
<p>and right hand of his associate were fixed on a
</p>
<p>spear, and set up in Edinburgh.
</p>
<p>The next leader of the conspiracy brought to
</p>
<p>punishment was the Earl of Athol, who had been
</p>
<p>apprehended by the Earl ot Angus, and lodged
</p>
<p>also in the Castle of Edinburgh. This aged no-
</p>
<p>bleman was arraigned and condemned by his peers ;
</p>
<p>though, in the presence of Antony de Santo Vito,
</p>
<p>Bishop of Urbino, and at that time Papal Legate
</p>
<p>in Scotland, he persisted in declaring his inno-
</p>
<p>cence. As the festival of Easter was at hand, the
</p>
<p>cross on which his grandson was tortured, was,
</p>
<p>from a religious feeling, taken down, as unbe-
</p>
<p>coming the associations connected with that great
</p>
<p>and solemn festival of the Christian Church ; but
</p>
<p>a pillai" was set up, to which he was bound. For
</p>
<p>three successive days the punishment of this no-
</p>
<p>bleman continued; and it is hardly credible to
</p>
<p>think that, at his great age, he was able to endure
</p>
<p>the tortures inflicted on him. If the narration
</p>
<p>of Buchanan be true, the Scots of that age showed
</p>
<p>themselves to be barbarians in no ordinary degree.
</p>
<p>At first he was placed naked in a cart, over which a
</p>
<p>stork-like swipe or engine like a crane was placed,
</p>
<p>and by ropes through pullies he was hoisted up in
</p>
<p>the air. The ropes being loosened, he was sud-
</p>
<p>denly let down again with great violence, the motion
</p>
<p>of the excruciating torture causing a relaxation
</p>
<p>of the joints.  In this manner was this aged no-
</p>
<p>bleman dragged along the High Street and the Ca-
</p>
<p>nongate of Edinburgh. On the second day he was

<p>bound to the pillar, and a red-hot iron crown
</p>
<p>placed upon his head, with the inscription above,
</p>
<p>The King of all Traitors ! * that the prediction
</p>
<p>of the Highland soothsayer might be fulfilled, that
</p>
<p>he should be crowned King before a gieat con-
</p>
<p>course of people. He was then placed upon a
</p>
<p>hurdle, and drawn at the horse's tail through the
</p>
<p>principal streets. The third day closed his suffer-
</p>
<p>ings. He was led out to the scaffold, where a
</p>
<p>scene of no ordinary cruelty was to be exhibited.
</p>
<p>He was brought on the scaffold, and while he was
</p>
<p>yet alive, he was stretched naked along it, his
</p>
<p>bowels were cut out and cast into a fire, afterwards
</p>
<p>his Jjeart was pulled out and also consumed, f He
</p>
<p>was then beheaded and quartered. His hoary
</p>
<p>head was placed upon a spear in a prominent part
</p>
<p>of the city encircled with a crown of iron, and
</p>
<p>his four quarters were set up on posts in Perth,
</p>
<p>Stirling, Glasgow, and Aberdeen.
</p>
<p>Such is the traditionary narrative of the punish-
</p>
<p>ment of the aged Athol, who was at this time in
</p>
<p>his seventieth year ; and it certainly proves, in a
</p>
<p>remarkable degree, the barbarism of the Scots at
</p>
<p>that period. That Athol was concerned in the
</p>
<p>Conspiracy is undeniable ; but as he was not a
</p>
<p> Our contemporary writer denies the fact of the red-
</p>
<p>hot iron crown. He says, that Athol was led to the " po-
</p>

</p>
<p>corone of papir put upon his hed, the which was all aboute

</p>
<p>personal actor in it, the tortures inflicted on him
</p>
<p>were revolting and infamous. It is proper to
</p>
<p>mention, also, that he continued to assert his in-
</p>
<p>nocence to the Bishop of Urbino, the Papal Le-
</p>
<p>gate, who was present at his trial, and to whom
</p>
<p>he confessed himself. He maintained to that pre-
</p>
<p>late to the last, that he had never consented to the
</p>
<p>King's death ; but he admitted that he knew of it,
</p>
<p>and kept the intentions of the conspirators secret,
</p>
<p>because Sir Robert Stuart was his own grandson,
</p>
<p>whom he did not wish to expose. He admitted,
</p>
<p>also, that Stuart had proposed the conspiracy to
</p>
<p>him, but that he counselled him against it, re-
</p>
<p>garding the whole matter as a wild and visionary
</p>
<p>scheme of a young man. He appears, indeed, to
</p>
<p>have expected a pardon till he was led out to the
</p>
<p>scaffold.
</p>
<p>But supposing Athol guilty of treason to the
</p>
<p>full extent, no one will deny that the revenge was
</p>
<p>infamous in the highest degree. His hoary hairs
</p>
<p>ought at least to have saved him from the torture
</p>
<p>of three successive days. His royal birth, and re-
</p>
<p>lationsliip to the King, also, though it made his
</p>
<p>crime the greater, inasmuch as James had been to
</p>
<p>him and his family no inconsiderable benefactor,
</p>
<p>ought to have saved him from being held up to
</p>
<p>the ignorant rabble in this shocking manner. It
</p>
<p>was disgraceful to the royal house of Scotland to
</p>
<p>see one of its princes cruelly arrayed in the mock
</p>
<p>ensigns of royalty, and it was no less disgraceful
</p>
<p>to the peers to see one of their number, whose

<p>guilt might bear a question, and whose age was

<p>certainly excusable, thus enduring wanton torture

<p>Could inflict, and humanity required its infliction

</p>
<p>in the shortest manner. It was, however, the re-
</p>
<p>venge of Joanna, and it was a fearful revenge for
</p>
<p>a woman.
</p>
<p>Tiie revolting narrative, however, is not con-
</p>
<p>cluded. Another, and the most miportant conspi-
</p>
<p>rator, was yet to he punished, namely. Sir Robert
</p>
<p>Graham ; and in the case of this audacious crimi-
</p>
<p>nal, there was certainly some excuse for the ap-
</p>
<p>plication of the torture. It appears from the con-
</p>
<p>fessions of Christopher Chambers, that many of
</p>
<p>the inferior sort, who were connected with the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, were drawn into it totally ignorant of
</p>
<p>Graham's intentions, he holding out to them, that
</p>
<p>his motive for attacking the Dominican C< invent
</p>
<p>was merely to carry off a young lady of the court,
</p>
<p>with whom Stuart was enamoured, and whom he
</p>
<p>intended to marry the following day. They de-
</p>
<p>clared, that they knew not even the nature of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy, until they had at once become parties
</p>
<p>in the regicide. Whether this be true or not, is of
</p>
<p>little consequence ; Graham was the contriver of
</p>
<p>the whole plot, and the first who plunged his dag-
</p>
<p>ger into his sovereign's breast. He was removed to
</p>
<p>Stirling, where he was brought to trial, the inha-
</p>
<p>bitants of the metropolis being sufficiently disgust-
</p>
<p>ed at the recent executions. This ferocious as-
</p>
<p>sassin had the hardihood to glory in his crime, to
</p>
<p>tell his judges, that there was no law to put him
</p>
<p>to death, as he had committed no fault, but had
</p>
<p>slain his mortal enemy, which might be proved
</p>
<p>by his own letters, written to the King some years
</p>
<p>before, sealed with his own seal, in which he had
</p>
<p>sent his defiance to the King, and renounced his

<p>allegiance, for reasons, as he conceived, perfectly
</p>
<p>satisfactory. It was evident, therefore, that if he

</p>
<p>(Graham) got justice done him, they would im-
</p>
<p>mediately set him at liberty, because the King
</p>
<p>would have destroyed him if he had been able to
</p>
<p>apprehend him. Perceiving, however, that this
</p>
<p>reasoning was treated with contempt by the judges,
</p>
<p>Graham looked steadily at them, with a bold and
</p>
<p>courageous countenance, and thus addressed them
</p>
<p>from the bar :  " Sinful, wretched, and tyrannical
</p>
<p>Scotsmen ! without prudence, ignorant, and weak-
</p>
<p>minded, well do I know that I shall die, and that
</p>
<p>I cannot escape your murderous hands. By ma-
</p>
<p>lice, and not by law, ye have determined to doom
</p>
<p>me to death, which condemnation God hath in-
</p>
<p>flicted on me, not by reason of this pretended ac-
</p>
<p>cusation, but for various offences and grievous sins,
</p>
<p>which, in the days of my youthful inexperience, I
</p>
<p>committed against him. Yet doubt it not, that
</p>
<p>you will yet see the day when you will pray for
</p>
<p>my soul, for the good I have done to you, as one
</p>
<p>of the greatest benefactors of this realm, for having
</p>
<p>slain and delivered you from the government of a
</p>
<p>cruel tyrant, the greatest enemy whom the Scots
</p>
<p>or Scotland ever had, noted even in his youth for
</p>
<p>his unsatiable avarice, his uusupportable tyranny,
</p>
<p>without pity or compassion to relations or friends,
</p>
<p>high or low, rich or poor. "
</p>
<p>This speech, which was long remembered in
</p>
<p>Scotland, though delivered with considerable ener-
</p>
<p>gy and eloquence, made no impression on Graham's
</p>
<p>judges. He was immediately condemned, and the
</p>
<p>sentence was speedily carried into execution in the
</p>
<p>town of Stirling, in a manner, if possible, still more
</p>
<p>revolting and barbarous than the punishment of his

</p>
<p>The criminal was placed in a cart, in the centre

<p>I. ASSASSINATION OF JAMES I. 57
</p>
<p>of which a pole of seven or eiglit feet in height
</p>
<p>was placed, and to this pole he was in a manner
</p>
<p>suspended hy the right hand, which was transfixed
</p>
<p>to the top of the pole, the dagger driven through
</p>
<p>it with which he slew the King. In this manner
</p>
<p>he was drawn through the town. After enduring
</p>
<p>this torture, the executioner, with the same knife
</p>
<p>or dagger, separated the hand from the hody, and
</p>
<p>burnt it before his face. He was then nailed to
</p>
<p>the pole, in a state of complete nudity, and a se-
</p>
<p>cond time drawn through the town. In this pro-
</p>
<p>gress, two executioners were placed opposite to
</p>
<p>him, who continually cut and gashed his body with
</p>
<p>hooked instruments of red-liot iron, pinching and
</p>
<p>twisting his thighs, legs, arms, sides, back, shoul-
</p>
<p>ders, neck, and belly ;  " the whole musckells of
</p>
<p>his body, " says Sir James Balfour, " being cut
</p>
<p>in long slitts, "  his tormentors seeking out the
</p>
<p>most tender parts of the body on which to inflict
</p>
<p>their pinching gashes. This excruciating torture
</p>
<p>excited the pity of the beholders, who turned with
</p>
<p>disgust from the appalling sight. In the midst
</p>
<p>of these tortures, Graham conducted himself
</p>
<p>with a courage and resolution worthy of a better
</p>
<p>cause. " This that ye are doing to me, " he ex-
</p>
<p>claimed, with a deadly voice, " being against the
</p>
<p>law, is another proof of your unmeasurable ty-
</p>
<p>ranny. The world will henceforth mention the
</p>
<p>Scots as brutal barbarians, when the painful and
</p>
<p>tyrannical tortures are known which you liave in-
</p>
<p>flicted on me, and which it is hardly possible to

<p>endure. I doubt not, if ye continue your wanton

<p>tortures on my wretched body, tliat the very pain

</p>
<p>The sight, indeed, was too much for humanity
</p>
<p>to endure, and some nobles, who attended on the
</p>
<p>execution, made the unhappy Graham be instantly
</p>
<p>taken down. But it was a humanity more bar-
</p>
<p>barous than the wanton cruelties he had previous-
</p>
<p>ly suflfered, inasmuch as they were reserving him
</p>
<p>for greater torments. Covered with blood, and
</p>
<p>disBgured by frightful and ghastly wounds, a rough
</p>
<p>mantle of the coarsest texture was thrown over
</p>
<p>his body, and he was afterwards cast into a
</p>
<p>nauseous and horrid dungeon in the town. While
</p>
<p>in this state of insensibility, some of the inferior
</p>
<p>sort were hanged, bowelled, and quartered, after
</p>
<p>which Graham was brought out to his final execu-
</p>
<p>tion. When carried to the scaffold, he was set on
</p>
<p>his feet, and instantly the coarse mantle which had
</p>
<p>been thrown over him, and which, having stopped
</p>
<p>the blood, had stuck fast to his wounds, was torn
</p>
<p>from his body, and the blood again gushed from the
</p>
<p>ghastly wi'ithings. So excruciating was the pain
</p>
<p>of this dreadful punishment, that the criminal
</p>
<p>fell down in a swoon, from which he did not re-
</p>
<p>cover for some time. When he revived, he said
</p>

<p>gicide sufficiently, or tired of their barbarous cru-
</p>
<p>elties, or unable to invent any other torture, now
</p>
<p>proceeded to the completion of the sentence. Gra-
</p>
<p>liam was beheaded, and his bowels taken from his
</p>
<p>body; his heart cast into afire, and his body quar-
</p>
<p>tered, and sent to the four principal towns in the
</p>
<p>kingdom. His head was set over the West Port
</p>
<p>gate of the city of Edinburgh.
</p>
<p>Thus ended the punishment of the conspirators
</p>
<p>against James I., in which the most summary re-
</p>
<p>venge was inflicted on those persons. If the con-
</p>
<p>spiracy against the King, and the circumstances at-
</p>
<p>tending that prince's murder, were atrocious in no
</p>
<p>ordinary degree, and if the courage of Graham, in
</p>
<p>particular, was not inferior to " his dark fanati-
</p>
<p>cism of vengeance, as appeared from the spirit
</p>
<p>with which he bore his punishment, " it must
</p>
<p>be admitted that the assassins rendered a terrible
</p>
<p>retribution, and that the vengeance which was
</p>
<p>taken upon them was amply proportioned to the
</p>
<p>magnitude of the crime. The annals of few mo-
</p>
<p>dern nations are stained with more wanton cruel-
</p>
<p>ties than are the annals of the Scots ; and the pu-
</p>
<p>nishment of those conspirators now recorded may
</p>
<p>be placed on the same line with the tortures prac-
</p>
<p>tised by the most savage and barbaious nations.
</p>
<p>The ingenuity of torture which appears in the am-
</p>
<p>ple narrative now given, from an authority which
</p>
<p>is undoubted, and which is substantiated by the
</p>
<p>unanimous testimonies of our historians, was cha-

<p>But while it is admitted that these tortures suf-
</p>
<p>ficiently indicate the rudeness of the age, and
</p>
<p>prove that the Scots of that century were bar-
</p>
<p>barous in no ordinary degree, it must not be for-
</p>
<p>gotten, that the necessary allowances must be
</p>
<p>made for this rudeness and barbarism, the forego-
</p>
<p>ing remarkable exhibition of which was called
</p>
<p>forth to revenge a crime of the greatest atrocity,
</p>
<p>committed under circumstances of peculiar ag-
</p>
<p>gravation. If, as has been already said, the re-
</p>
<p>venge was Joanna's, it was a revenge hardly cre-
</p>
<p>dible to be sanctioned by a woman ; and yet
</p>
<p>there is every reason to conclude that it was un-
</p>
<p>der her auspices, as the conspirators, before they
</p>
<p>were apprehended, expressed their dread of the
</p>
<p>Queen's vengeance, and as she at that time was
</p>
<p>vested with the executive government. The inflic-
</p>
<p>tion of the torture, however, on regicides, or on
</p>
<p>those who have attempted the life of their sovereign,
</p>
<p>has been witnessed among nations more civilized
</p>
<p>than were the Scots in the fifteenth century, and in
</p>
<p>a more enlightened age. llavilliac, who assas-
</p>
<p>sinated Henry IV. of France in 1608, was put
</p>
<p>to death in a manner as cruel, to say the least,
</p>
<p>as were the Scottish conspirators ; and Damiens,
</p>
<p>who attempted the life of Louis XV. of the
</p>
<p>same country, suffered tortures, even in the mid-
</p>
<p>dle of the 18th century, which would have dis-
</p>
<p>graced an age of greater barbarism than that of
</p>
<p>James I. of Scotland. Both of these criminals,
</p>
<p>too, were under the influence of fanaticism ; the
</p>
<p>insanity of the latter, in particular, was proved
</p>
<p>beyond a doubt ; while the conspiracy against

</p>
<p>manner, from a principle of private revenge, and
</p>
<p>I. ASSASSINATION OF JAMES I. 61
</p>
<p>from a wisli to gratify the most lawless ambition.
</p>
<p>The rudeness of the age, therefore, which cannot be
</p>
<p>pleaded in the cases of Ravilliac and Damiens, may
</p>
<p>be held as an apology for the tortures which the
</p>
<p>Scottish regicides suffered ; and though the best
</p>
<p>feelings of humanity, as regulated by philosophy,
</p>
<p>and enlightened by the precepts of a pure and ra-
</p>
<p>tional religion, naturally prompt us to lessen, as
</p>
<p>much as possible, the sufferings of condemned cri-
</p>
<p>minals, it is right, to a certain extent, that a more
</p>
<p>marked expression of public abhorrence should be
</p>
<p>awarded to the regicide. For, if he be justly ac-
</p>
<p>counted infamous by his fellow men who is a
</p>
<p>traitor to his country, how much more infamous
</p>
<p>is he who dares to shed the blood of his sovereign,
</p>
<p>who is Pater Patriae, the father of his country ?
</p>
<p>With respect to Graham, notwithstanding the
</p>
<p>tortures he endured, he was long remembered by
</p>
<p>the Scots with abhorrence in a popular rhyme of
</p>
<p>the country :

<p>" Sir Robert Graham,
</p>
<p>Who slew our King,

<p>Such is the account furnished by a contempo-

</p>
<p>SIR DAVID LINDSAY,
</p>
<p>The circumstances which let! to the untimely fate
</p>
<p>of James III., mark in a peculiar manner the age
</p>
<p>in which he lived. The aristocracy, fierce and
</p>
<p>powerful, utterly disregarded the authority of their
</p>
<p>sovereign, and viewed the reigning prince as a
</p>
<p>mere machine, on whose shoulders the government
</p>
<p>ostensibly rested, but who depended on them
</p>
<p>alone for co-operation and support. James, on the

<p>Other hand, to adopt the quaint language of Drum-
</p>
<p>mond of Hawtliornden, " conceived that noble-
</p>
<p>men, like the coin, were of his predecessors' mak-
</p>
<p>ing ; and why he might not put his stamp upon
</p>
<p>the same metal, or, when those old metals were
</p>
<p>defaced, that he might not refound them, and give
</p>
<p>them a new print, he could not well conceive. "
</p>
<p>On many points, therefore, the Scottish nobles
</p>
<p>differed from their sovereign, though none exas-
</p>
<p>perated them more than a new creation of their
</p>
<p>order, and the exaltation of paltry minions to the
</p>
<p>honours and the privileges of nobility. Proud to
</p>
<p>a proverb of their ancestors, and tenacious of their
</p>
<p>dignity, the Scottish nobles of that age were not
</p>
<p>the men to submit with patience to those infringe-
</p>
<p>ments on their rights as peers, and to proceedings
</p>
<p>which they deemed as insults to their families,
</p>
<p>whose antiquity they boasted could be traced to
</p>
<p>the very foundation of the monarchy. A series of
</p>
<p>intestine broils, caused for the most part by the
</p>
<p>imprudent conduct of James, ensued ; which end-
</p>
<p>ed in their appearing in arms against their sove-
</p>
<p>reign, on a spot sacred in the annals of Scottish
</p>
<p>story,  where their ancestors boldly encounter-

<p>ed the English host,  where Bruce, the great
</p>
<p>restorer of the monarchy, obtained his most sig-
</p>
<p>nal victory,  where the song of national enthu-
</p>
<p>siasm was raised by many a gallant warrior, and
</p>
<p>appalled the effeminate Edward of England. On

<p>that very spot  the well known field of Bannock-

<p>ed field, won by his skill, and the valour of his
</p>
<p>warriors.
</p>
<p>We have seen, in the case of James I., that the
</p>
<p>policy which that prince adopted in endeavourinj^
</p>
<p>to humble the exorbitant power of the aristocracy,
</p>
<p>was attended with disastrous consequences ; and
</p>
<p>the Dominican Monastery at Perth witnessed the
</p>
<p>indomitable spirit of disappointed ambition. His
</p>
<p>son and successor, James II., when he came of
</p>
<p>age, had to oppose the flood of aristocratic tyranny
</p>
<p>and violence wliich had been restrained by tempo-
</p>
<p>rary barriers under the stern administration of
</p>
<p>his father ; and the House of Douglas, during his
</p>
<p>reign, was so powerful, as to contend with royal
</p>
<p>authority, and assert its independence with the ut-
</p>
<p>most insolence and haughtiness. The fall of that
</p>
<p>House, however, which James himself accelerated,
</p>
<p>by stabbing Douglas with his own hand in Stir-
</p>
<p>ling Castle, freed him not only from a turbulent
</p>
<p>peer, whose retainers were numerous, and who
</p>
<p>lived in a sort of regal splendour, creating knights,
</p>
<p>and convening senatorial assemblies, but even from
</p>
<p>a <langerous rival ; yet the assassination of Dou-
</p>
<p>glas,  a breach of good faith and kingly pledge, 
</p>
<p>was regarded by his subjects with horror ; and it
</p>
<p>hindered not the successor of that same Douglas,
</p>
<p>with other nobles, to enter into a dangerous as-
</p>
<p>sociation against James, and exhibit manifestoes
</p>
<p>on the doors of the principal churches, declaring,
</p>
<p>" that they were resolved never to obey, com-
</p>
<p>mand, or charge, nor answer any citation for the

<p>time coming ; because the King, so far from being

</p>
<p>68 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>frustrated the intentions of this association ; nor
</p>
<p>was it long before he effected the complete and
</p>
<p>irrecoverable fall of the House of Douglas. Mis-
</p>
<p>fortune, however, overtook him, as well as his
</p>
<p>father ; and his brilliant career vsoon set in tlie fa-
</p>
<p>tality which attended the princes of his house.
</p>
<p>Rash curiosity prompted him to examine too
</p>
<p>cautiously one of the rudely contrived cannons of
</p>
<p>that age at the siege of Roxburgh Castle ; and
</p>
<p>Scotland was again to bewail the untimely death
</p>
<p>of an accomplished monarch, for whose loss the
</p>
<p>demolition of that calamitous fortress was but a
</p>
<p>sorrowful consolation.
</p>
<p>The progeny of James II. were, his son who
</p>
<p>succeeded him, Alexander Duke of Albany, John,
</p>
<p>afterwards Earl of Mar, and two daughters  all
</p>
<p>infants ; James III. being only in the eighth year
</p>
<p>of his age. A regency administered the govern-
</p>
<p>ment till the King attained his eighteenth year,
</p>
<p>during which, from the silence of our annals, lit-
</p>
<p>tle is known of the internal state of the kingdom.
</p>
<p>The disposition of James differed from that of Ids
</p>
<p>two predecessors, and rendered him incapable of
</p>
<p>governing a turbulent people in a rude and turbu-
</p>
<p>lent age. In person he was elegant, but weak in
</p>
<p>mind, without dignity or prudence. His habits
</p>
<p>were not those which were calculated to ensure
</p>
<p>respect and attachment ; his pursuits were charac-
</p>
<p>terized by the ignorance of the times, his proneness
</p>
<p>to superstition, love of retirement, and attachment
</p>
<p>to favourites, disgusted his nobles, and accelerated

<p>him in his indolence. His virtues were thus coun-
</p>
<p>terbalanced by failings which approximated to
</p>
<p>vices ; and though his reign is characterized by few
</p>
<p>acts of injustice on his own part, his inclination to
</p>
<p>despotism was not the less conspicuous ;  his im-
</p>
<p>patience of moderate courses too often prompt-
</p>
<p>ing him to hasty and imprudent outrages. A
</p>
<p>sovereign thus constituted was liable to the intrigues
</p>
<p>of opposing factions, who would not fail to im-
</p>
<p>prove the advantages his own remissness afforded,
</p>
<p>and evince their dissatisfaction by exploits of bold-
</p>
<p>ness and decision.
</p>
<p>But from the years 1469 to 1476, James III.
</p>
<p>had been uniformly successful in his government,
</p>
<p>and fortune had been more liberal to him in her
</p>
<p>favours than to his more immediate predecessors.
</p>
<p>In his minority, the executive government appears
</p>
<p>to have been intrusted to his mother, Mary of
</p>
<p>Gueldres, assisted by the prudence, ability, and
</p>
<p>wisdom of James Kennedy, Bishop of St An-
</p>
<p>drew's, (for the See was not then archiepiscopal),
</p>
<p>a prelate as illustrious for his piety and learning,
</p>
<p>as he was for his royal birth and ancient lineage.
</p>
<p>To tiiis princely prelate, a grandson of Robert III.,

<p>Scotland is indebted for her first establishment of

<p>the surron<k'r of Berwick to tlie Scots, an acqui-

</p>
<p>Edward Baliol ; the cessation of the Orkneys to
</p>
<p>Scotland, by the marriage of James to Margaret
</p>
<p>of Denmark, daughter of Christian I., and th.e
</p>
<p>possession of the Shetland Islands, sold by the
</p>
<p>same monarch to James, to enable him to car-
</p>
<p>ry on his war with Sweden ; * the treaty with
</p>
<p>ton. Even the University of Edinburgh owes its origi-
</p>
<p>nal foundation to Robert Kcid, Bishop of Orkney. The
</p>
<p>Marischal College, Aberdeen, founded by the Earl Maris-
</p>
<p>chal, is the only Scottish University founded by a lay-
</p>
<p>man.
</p>
<p>* Before that period (14.G8 and 14-69), the Orkney and
</p>
<p>the Shetland Islands belonged to Denmark, and they were
</p>
<p>sold, or rather pledged, to James III. by Christian, at the
</p>
<p>marriage of James and IMargajet of Denmark, as part of
</p>
<p>the marriage-portion of that princess. The portion which
</p>
<p>James received with IMargaret, was 60,000 florins, 10,000
</p>
<p>of which were to be paid by the Danish King to the Scot-
</p>
<p>tish ambassadors, and the Orkney Islands were assigned
</p>
<p>to James as a pledge for the 50,000, until redeemed
</p>
<p>by him or any of his successors. But Christian's affairs
</p>
<p>rendered him unable to pay the remaining 10,000 florins,
</p>
<p>and his Swedish war served as an apology for his oifer-
</p>
<p>ing the Shetland Islands as part of that sum. He propos-
</p>
<p>ed them in pledge to James for 8000 florins, while he
</p>
<p>agreed to pay the remaining 2000, (a sum now nearly
</p>
<p>equal to about 20,000/. Sterling), and the proposal was
</p>
<p>accepted. As the pledge was never redeemed, the
</p>

</p>
<p>having no standing army, the utmost facility was
</p>
<p>given to the formation of a powerful confederacy :
</p>
<p>72 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>a catalogue of crimes, a series of misfortunes,
</p>
<p>and the usual result of imprudence,  a dangerous
</p>
<p>conspiracy, were to characterize the remaining
</p>
<p>years of the reign of James III., and to terminate
</p>
<p>in his ruin.
</p>
<p>The disposition and the private habits of the
</p>
<p>King had been little in accordance with the splen-
</p>
<p>did acquisitions above recorded, from the success
</p>
<p>of which we would naturally conclude that he
</p>
<p>was a prince of great abilities. In the year 1476,
</p>
<p>when his misfortunes commenced, he had reached
</p>
<p>his twenty-fifth year,  the ge in which the civil
</p>
<p>law sanctions a complete majority ; and, perhaps,
</p>
<p>much must be allowed for the previous inexpe-
</p>
<p>rience of youth, and his capricious disposition,
</p>
<p>which would rather be encouraged by ambitious
</p>
<p>minions, than restrained and regulated by the sa-
</p>
<p>lutary principles of moderation and prudence. Un-
</p>
<p>able to discriminate, or to estimate rightly the dis-
</p>
<p>positions of those by whom he was surrounded,
</p>
<p>and of his subjects at large, James found himself
</p>
<p>overwhelmed by misfortune ere he was aware, and
</p>
<p>a confederacy, which he could have checked at its
</p>
<p>first commencement, grown too powerful to be
</p>
<p>dismayed by the threatened vengeance of a mo-
</p>
<p>narch, who was without resources to oppose, and
</p>
<p>unable to prevent, the leaders of any association.
</p>
<p>The habits of James were widely different from
</p>
<p>those of his brothers, the Duke of Albany and the
</p>
<p>Earl of Mar. From a peculiar weakness of mind,
</p>
<p>for which the age in which he lived is doubtless
</p>
<p>an excuse, James was a religious believer in every
</p>
<p>superstitious absurdity. He was greatly addicted

</p>
<p>Studies, added to others more praiseworthy, name-
</p>
<p>ly, music and architecture, were his sole occupa-
</p>
<p>tions ; and in solitary retirement, he forgot or ne-
</p>
<p>glected the duties of a monarch amid various idle
</p>
<p>amusements. As the nobles in those days seldom
</p>
<p>visited the court, except when on urgent business,
</p>
<p>they were totally ignorant of the favourite pur-
</p>
<p>suits of their sovereign. It may be easily con-
</p>
<p>ceived, that the society of men who held these
</p>
<p>studies as utterly effeminate and contemptible,
</p>
<p>would be of no great importance to James, and
</p>
<p>that he would use every means to rid himself of
</p>
<p>their presence. The same fatality prompted him
</p>
<p>to forget his dignity, and to associate with low-
</p>
<p>born and despicable minions, who flattered him in
</p>
<p>his favourite pursuits, and who pretended to excel
</p>
<p>in the sciences to which he was addicted. Men
</p>
<p>of mean origin thus exalted above their degree,
</p>
<p>knowing well the evil eyes that were upon them,
</p>
<p>felt their only safety to consist in preserving the
</p>
<p>delusion of James. The conduct of the King, in-
</p>
<p>deed, in this respect, would almost infer a kind of
</p>
<p>infatuation. William Shevez, Archdeacon of St
</p>
<p>Andrews, an unprincipled ecclesiastic, who by va-
</p>
<p>rious arts and impostures succeeded in supplanting
</p>
<p>the pious Patrick Graham, first Archbishop of St
</p>
<p>Andrews, uterine brother to the munificent Ken-
</p>
<p>nedy, Bishop of that See, and founder of the Uni-
</p>
<p>versity, was one of the King's chief favourites, on
</p>
<p>account of his pretensions to astrology. Cochrane,

<p>their names were respectalile vvlien compared witli
</p>
<p>the other chosen companions of tlie Scottish King.
</p>
<p>William Torphichen, a swordsman or fencing-
</p>
<p>master, James Hommil, a tailor, and one Leonard,
</p>
<p>a smith, were the daily associates of James 111.,
</p>
<p>on whom he heaped rewards and favoms, who
</p>
<p>wore his chief counsellors, and with whom he
</p>
<p>completely forgot the majesty of the sovereign.
</p>
<p>It was not to he expected that the haughty
</p>
<p>nobles of Scotland in that age could behold the
</p>
<p>exaltation of these worthless minions, and the ne-
</p>
<p>glect of their own ancient order, without exasper-
</p>
<p>ation. Their hatred and contempt of the King
</p>
<p>necessarily increased when they placed him in con-
</p>
<p>trast with his brothers, who excelled in all those
</p>
<p>martial accomplishments which command respect
</p>
<p>in a feudal age, and among fierce and warlike
</p>
<p>barons. - It was only, according to Lindsay of
</p>
<p>Pitscottie, that the two princes, especially Albany,
</p>
<p>whose courage was well known, were on good
</p>
<p>terms with James, notwithstanding his superstiti-
</p>
<p>ous predilections, that the Scottish nobles were
</p>
<p>restrained from appearing in open rebellion.
</p>
<p>But a confederacy was secretly forming, and, in
</p>
<p>1 179, circumstances soon occurred which called it
</p>
<p>into action, and roused the King from his effe-
</p>
<p>minate lethargy. It was destined, too, to com-
</p>
<p>mence with Albany and Mar. The former prince
</p>
<p>had been appointed Warden of the Eastern Marches
</p>
<p>for life, governor of Berwick, and lord-lieutenant
</p>
<p>of the Borders ; he was also vested with the earl-
</p>
<p>dom of March. Very extensive powers had been

<p>conceded to Albany for the execution of his office,

</p>
<p>was, that t!ie Barons or Iiordor Chiefs of t!e ad-
</p>
<p>jacent counties, who were chiefly freehooters, he-
</p>
<p>gan to plot his destruction. The Flomos and the
</p>
<p>llephurns, in particular, two very numerous and
</p>
<p>powerful septs, had conceived a violent enmity to-
</p>
<p>wards him, on account of some peculiar oft'encethey
</p>
<p>had received, or fancied they had received, from Al-
</p>
<p>bany, whose earldom of March lay contiguous to
</p>
<p>their possessions. He had, moreover, compelled
</p>
<p>them to restore to him certain lands, which they
</p>
<p>had by some means or other ingeniously acquired
</p>
<p>in the preceding reign. Afraid, however, that they
</p>
<p>were unable to oppose him successfully in an open
</p>
<p>attack, which they would not have scrupled to have
</p>
<p>done had a favourable opportunity offered, they
</p>
<p>began tfieir practices in a difterent quarter.
</p>
<p>Certain emissaries of those freebooters repair-
</p>
<p>ed to the Court, and obtained access to Cochrane,
</p>
<p>the King's chief favourite, who, they knew well,
</p>
<p>resented Albany's contempt, though he dreaded his
</p>
<p>power. A confederacy had indeed been previous-
</p>
<p>ly formed against the royal favourites, with which
</p>
<p>Albany and his brother the Earl of Mar, had no
</p>
<p>inconsiderable connexion. It was not difficult, in
</p>
<p>these circumstances, to obtain Cochrane's co-opera-
</p>
<p>tion in their endeavours to effect the ruin of Al-
</p>
<p>bany, as it was the interest of that minion .and his
</p>
<p>associates to weaken the power of those whom
</p>
<p>they knew well beheld them with contempt and
</p>
<p>indignation. The propositions of the freebooters
</p>
<p>from the Borders were readily assented to by
</p>
<p>Cochrane, who confessed that he also lireaded Al-
</p>
<p>bany's power, and promised that, at a convenient

<p>time, he would endeavour to accomplish their mu-
</p>
<p>tual purpose. The minion was farther flattered by
</p>
<p>76 CONSriRACIES.
</p>
<p>a suitable sum of money ; and from tliat time he
</p>
<p>laboured with great assiduity to elf(?ct a discord
</p>
<p>between James an(} liis brother. Knowing the
</p>
<p>King's superstitious belief in witchcraft and pro-
</p>
<p>phecy, he privately stimulated an old woman to
</p>
<p>pass herself off as a witch before the King, who
</p>
<p>predicted to James that he would one day be slain
</p>
<p>by his own kindred. This prediction heightened
</p>
<p>the King's superstitious terrors, and his suspicions
</p>
<p>immediately alighted on his brothers. * The pro-
</p>
<p>phecy, aggravated by the artful insinuations of
</p>
<p>Cochrane and his associates, made a great impres-
</p>
<p>sion on the King, who soon began to recollect va-
</p>
<p>rious actions and expressions of Albany which
</p>
<p>seemed to him to establish the fact. As it was
</p>
<p>the interest of those minions to ruin the Earl of
</p>
<p>Mar also, that prince was not forgotten. It was
</p>
<p>brought to the King's recollection, that Mar had
</p>
<p>often ridiculed him, and spoken in language which
</p>
<p>sufficiently proved that he and his brother had a
</p>
<p>design against his life. But a much more serious
</p>
<p>charge was brought against Mar, and one which
</p>
<p>at once roused every superstitious feeling of James.
</p>
<p>He was accused of using magical arts against the
</p>
<p>King's life,  that he associated with notorious
</p>
<p>witches and sorcerers,  and that he was concern-
</p>
<p>ed in the consuming of a waxen image of the King

<p> Lindsay of Pitscottie, p. 116, 117. Buchanan (lib.

<p>James to his brothers, to the prediction of one Andrew, a
</p>
<p>Flemish astrologer, who was high in favour with the King,
</p>
<p>and who had declared that " a lion should be killed by his

<p>health by magic.
</p>
<p>Mar, who was very younf;^, was probably in
</p>
<p>complete ignorance of those absurd and Huperstitious
</p>
<p>practices in witchcraft ; still less, perhaps, did he
</p>
<p>ever imagine that he was the subject of such accu-
</p>
<p>sations. The real cause, however, of the King's
</p>
<p>enmity towards his brothers, for it is hardly pos-
</p>
<p>sible to conceive it to have resulted from the above
</p>
<p>traditions, is unknown, but it was attended with
</p>
<p>disastrous consequences. From a prince, observes
</p>
<p>Buchanan on this subject with great truth, of con-
</p>
<p>siderable genius and good hopes, and as yet not
</p>
<p>wholly depraved, the King degenerated into a cniel
</p>
<p>tyrant; for when his mind was filled with these sus-
</p>
<p>picions, he reckoned his nearest kindred, and the
</p>
<p>best of his nobility, his greatest enemies. Be this
</p>
<p>as it may, Albany and Mar were apprehended at
</p>
<p>the King's instance, under the pretence of being
</p>
<p>concerned in a plot against the royal authority and
</p>
<p>life. This arbitrary conduct of James still farther in-
</p>
<p>censed the nobles against him and his minions, and
</p>
<p>strengthened the confederacy against them, inas-
</p>
<p>much as the two brothers had, in reality, no great
</p>
<p>connection with the intended conspiracy against the
</p>
<p>crown. It has indeed been asserted, that Albany
</p>
<p>was concerned in a treasonable correspondence
</p>
<p>with England, which was the cause of his impri-
</p>
<p>sonment ; and could the fact be ascertained, it
</p>
<p>would vindicate James. But the fact is doubtful ;
</p>
<p>for though Albany had, on various occasions, ap-
</p>
<p>plied the epithet oi bastard to the King, and after-
</p>
<p>wards assumed the royal title, there is no evidence

</p>
<p>pears to be, tliat the minions of James had prepos-
</p>
<p>sessed him against his brothers, by alarming his
</p>
<p>superstitious fears, and by laying before him false
</p>
<p>representations. Whatever were the causes of this
</p>
<p>rash procedure, James was to be stained with a
</p>
<p>brother's blood. It is somewhat remarkable, that
</p>
<p>three contemporary sovereigns of England, France,
</p>
<p>and Scotland, were each of them in the same si-
</p>
<p>tuation. Edward IV., on the most frivolous grounds,
</p>
<p>deprived his brother, the Duke of Clarence, of his
</p>
<p>life ; the only favour granted to that prince, was
</p>
<p>his being permitted to choose the manner of his
</p>
<p>death, and he was accordingly drowned in a butt
</p>
<p>of Malmsey wine. Louis XI. procured, among his
</p>
<p>other acts of tyranny, the assassination or murder
</p>
<p>of the Duke of Guienne ; and James III. of Scot-
</p>
<p>land scrupled not, as we shall subsequently see, to
</p>
<p>condemn his brother, the Earl of Mar, under the
</p>
<p>pretence that he associated with witches to deprive
</p>
<p>him of life. In the present age, the accusation of
</p>
<p>witchcraft only excites the smile of ridicule ; but
</p>
<p>we must not forget, that the reign of James was
</p>
<p>early in the history of improvement  In a more
</p>
<p>enlightened era, and under a better system, the
</p>
<p>belief in witchcraft or sorcery universally prevailed,
</p>
<p>and is not, perhaps, in some districts of Scotland
</p>
<p>wholly eradicated. James VI. wrote a book against
</p>
<p>it, and maintained that witchcraft was the greatest
</p>
<p>of crimes. The Presbyterians were most vigilant
</p>
<p>in their endeavours to procure the condemnation
</p>
<p>of witches ; and they actually, among their other
</p>
<p>acts of fanatical intolerance, burnt a poor old wo-

</p>
<p>Statutes of the Kirk are furious in their anathemas
</p>
<p>against it ; even Sir George Mackenzie sets forth,
</p>
<p>that witchcraft is a most horrible crime, and ought
</p>
<p>to be punished ; and that no person can doubt for
</p>
<p>a moment that there is such a crime as witchcraft,
</p>
<p>since the laws condemn it. So late as 1722, a
</p>
<p>poor woman became a victim in Scotland to this
</p>
<p>absurd superstition. Finally, in this digression, the
</p>
<p>sect of Presbyterian dissenters in Scotland called
</p>
<p>Seceders, published an act of their Associate Pres-
</p>
<p>bytery in 1743, which was reprinted at Glasgow
</p>
<p>in 1766. In this there is what they call their an-
</p>
<p>nual confession of sins ; and besides the sedition
</p>
<p>and extravagant language which it contains, the Se-
</p>
<p>ceders lamented, among other grievous calamities,
</p>
<p>national and personal, that " the penal statutes
</p>
<p>against witches have been rejjealcd hy Parliament.,
</p>
<p>contrary to the express laiv of God ! " In this,

<p>however, the Seceders of the last century were
</p>
<p>greatly mistaken. The " penal statutes against
</p>
<p>witchcraft," have not been repealed to this day,
</p>
<p>but common sense has repealed them. The zeal-
</p>
<p>ots of the Associate Presbytery in 1743 and in

<p>The two brothers of the King, thus intended to
</p>
<p>become the victims of superstition by a worthless
</p>
<p>minion and his associates, were speedily appre-
</p>
<p>hended. The Duke of Albany was committed a
</p>
<p>prisoner to Edinburgh Castle, and the Earl of Mar
</p>
<p>was seized in his bed by the King's orders, and
</p>
<p>confined in the Castle of Craigmillar, in the vici-
</p>
<p>nity of the metropolis, at that time a fortress of
</p>
<p>gi-eat strength. The Castle of Dunbar, which be-
</p>
<p>longed to Albany, yielded to the King after a short
</p>
<p>siege, at which the Lairds of Luss, Sauchie, and
</p>
<p>Craigie- Wallace, and a gentleman named Ramsay,
</p>
<p>of the King's army, were slain. The garrison,
</p>
<p>unable to hold out, and not choosing to trust to

<p>James' leniency, made their escape by night in fish-
</p>
<p>ing boats to the English coast.

</p>
<p>melancholy fate. Without a fair and open trial hy
</p>
<p>his peers, but in a private council, which ajipears
</p>
<p>to have consisted chiefly of Cochrane and his as-
</p>
<p>sociates, whose interest it was to effect the ruin of
</p>
<p>both princes, the unfortunate Mar was condemned
</p>
<p>to die for associating with witches, and practising
</p>
<p>magical arts, to affect the King's life. He was
</p>
<p>brought from the Castle of Craigmillar, the place
</p>
<p>of his confinement, to the Canongate of Edinburgh,
</p>
<p>in 1479, where, in the public street, a vein was
</p>
<p>cut, and he was allowed to bleed to death in a
</p>
<p>bath. This murder was attempted to be justified
</p>
<p>by sundry executions of witches which followed,
</p>
<p>who all confessed that Mar had dealings with them
</p>
<p>to destroy the King by incantations. They ac-
</p>
<p>knowledged that they had made a waxen image of
</p>
<p>the King, which they placed before a slow fire,
</p>
<p>and persuaded themselves that, in proportion as it
</p>
<p>consumed, the King's health would decay. As witch-
</p>
<p>craft was the current belief of the age, the execution
</p>
<p>of Mar does not seem to have excited any disgust
</p>
<p>among the people. It is supposed that this is the
</p>
<p>first instance of the execution of witches in Scot-
</p>
<p>land : Buchanan says, that twelve women were
</p>
<p>executed, all of the lowest condition. This cause
</p>
<p>of Mar's death was given out only to the vulgar ;
</p>
<p>but, according to the same writer, he was appre-
</p>
<p>hended and executed for speaking too rashly on the
</p>
<p>state of the kingdom,
</p>
<p>A fate equally fatal, though not perhaps similar,
</p>
<p>most probably awaited Albany, as he was the
</p>
<p>principal object of resentment to James' minions,
</p>
<p>had he not contrived to make his escape from the

</p>
<p>communication or intercourse save in tlie presence
</p>
<p>of liis keepers. Notwithstanding^ this vigilance,
</p>
<p>Albany did not despair. A Frencli vessel, proba-
</p>
<p>bly procured by his friends, appeared in the Vv'nh of
</p>
<p>Fortlj, and anchored in the roadstead oft' New-
</p>
<p>liaven, a village at a short distance from the seaport
</p>
<p>of Leith, and at that time little frequented, being
</p>
<p>only a place of resort for fishing-boats on the coast.
</p>
<p>The captain of the vessel, being in the plot, pre-
</p>
<p>tended that he had a cargo of excellent wines on
</p>
<p>board, and despatched one of the crew to the Cas-
</p>
<p>tle, with a message to the Duke, informing him that
</p>
<p>he might have the first choice. An order was of
</p>
<p>course given for two small casks of Malmsey 
</p>
<p>a wine at that time in great repute, and the casks,
</p>
<p>in order to remove suspicion, contained not more
</p>
<p>than two gallons. In the one cask, the captain enclos-
</p>
<p>ed a secret writing covered with wax, containing in-
</p>
<p>structions to the Duke, and in the other, some fa-
</p>
<p>thoms of rope by which he was to effect his escape.
</p>
<p>The Duke's servant was confidentially intrusted
</p>
<p>with the secret ; and as he had been employed by
</p>
<p>Albany as his messenger to the captain, the latter
</p>
<p>communicated to him more at large certain instmc-
</p>
<p>tions for his master.
</p>
<p>The King himself lodged in the Castle at the
</p>
<p>time, and the exploit was the more hazardous, as
</p>
<p>the only chance of escape was by getting over the
</p>
<p>wall unobserved by the numerous attendants who
</p>
<p>formed his retinue. On the night appointed for
</p>
<p>the attempt, the Governor of the fortress, having
</p>
<p>ordered tlie gates to be shut, set the watch on
</p>
<p>the battlements, and proceeded to the royal

<p>agreeable, more especially as he had been posi-
</p>
<p>tively assured by his emissaiies and friends
</p>
<p>that he was to be executed the following day,
</p>
<p>that evening entertained the Governor and his
</p>
<p>friends at supper, having invited them to try his
</p>
<p>wine, and his sole hope lay in their intoxication.
</p>
<p>Albany and his servant contrived to conceal their
</p>
<p>own abstemiousness, while they repeatedly }>lied
</p>
<p>their guests with the intoxicating liquor. They
</p>
<p>sat to a late hour, till the rest of the garrison
</p>
<p>were sunk in slumber. At length, according to
</p>
<p>Lind^^ay of Pitscottie, when the guests were com-
</p>
<p>pletely intoxicated, the Duke made a sign to his
</p>
<p>domestic, and starting from his seat, he suddenly
</p>
<p>attacked the Governor, whom he struck down with
</p>
<p>his weapon, and slew him, and two of his attend-
</p>
<p>ants, with his one hand. His domestic also as-
</p>
<p>sisted him to despatch the odious guests. They
</p>
<p>then rushed out to the most retired place on the
</p>
<p>Castle wall, where they would be the least ob-
</p>
<p>served by the sentinels ; and having fixed the rope,
</p>
<p>the domestic first hazarded the dangerous descent.
</p>
<p>But the rope was too short, and, from the dark-
</p>
<p>ness of the night, the great height was not clearly
</p>
<p>ascertained, in consequence of which the domestic
</p>
<p>fell, and broke his thigh-bone. He called out to
</p>
<p>the Duke to avoid a similar fate by lengthening
</p>
<p>the rope. Albany ran to his apartment, and seiz-
</p>
<p>ing the sheets on his bed, he increased the length
</p>
<p>of the rope by tying them together, and descended
</p>
<p>from the wall of the fortress in safety. His first
</p>
<p>object was to provide for his faithful domestic,
</p>
<p>whose misfortune precluded him from accompany-

<p>ing him in his flight. He carried him on his back,
</p>
<p>for more than a mile to a place of safety, af ter

</p>
<p>which he proceeded, with due speed, to Newhaven.
</p>
<p>On a signal being given, a boat put oft' from the
</p>
<p>vessel, which received Albany, who tlms narrowly
</p>
<p>escaped his brother's vengeance. The captain im-
</p>
<p>mediately sailed for France, where the fugitive
</p>
<p>prince arrived in safety, and was honourably receiv-
</p>
<p>ed by Louis IX.
</p>
<p>In the morning, when the rope was discovered
</p>
<p>hanging over the battlements, the alarm was given
</p>
<p>in the Castle, and the sentinels immediately pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to the Governor's apartments. But he
</p>
<p>was not to be found. Suspicions of Albany's
</p>
<p>flight being raised, they ran to the place of his
</p>
<p>confinement. They found the door of the apart-
</p>
<p>ment open, and the first object they beheld was one
</p>
<p>of the Governor's servants lying weltering in his
</p>
<p>blood. They soon perceived the bodies of that
</p>
<p>ofKcer himself, and his two other attendants dread-
</p>
<p>fully scorched, for, according to Lindsay of Pit-
</p>
<p>scottie, they had been thrown into the fire-place by
</p>
<p>Albany and his domestic in the struggle. The
</p>
<p>tidings were soon conveyed to the King, who, sur-
</p>
<p>prised at this escape of Albany, as it were from
</p>
<p>his own presence, refused to believe it till he saw
</p>
<p>the bodies of the men, and the means by which
</p>
<p>the Duke's escape had been effected. Still con-
</p>
<p>ceiving, however, that the fugitives might probably
</p>
<p>be concealed in the Castle, the gates were shut,
</p>
<p>and a most vigilant search was made, but in vain.
</p>
<p>Horsemen were then sent out in all directions
</p>
<p>throughout the adjacent country, with promises of
</p>
<p>liberal rewards if they apprehended him ; but their
</p>
<p>exertions met with the same success. In the mean

<p>time, a man from Leith, who happened to have some
</p>
<p>business in the Castle during the day, informed
</p>

</p>
<p>the King's attendants that a boat had put off from
</p>
<p>the French vessel in the roadstead, and taken on
</p>
<p>board some persons from Newhaven, after which
</p>
<p>the vessel immediately sailed down the Frith, and
</p>
<p>stood out to sea. This being deemed a satisfactory
</p>
<p>explanation of the whole matter, no farther search
</p>
<p>was made.
</p>
<p>There are few persons who know the Castle of
</p>
<p>Edinburgh, who will not be surprised at this dar-
</p>
<p>ing exploit of Albany. Situated on an immense
</p>
<p>rock which terminates the hill towards the west
</p>
<p>on which the ancient city is built, the Castle is
</p>
<p>totally inaccessible save on the east, where is the
</p>
<p>public entrance from the city. On the south, and
</p>
<p>especially on the north, the rock is perpendicular,
</p>
<p>and at that time it was almost suiTounded by the
</p>
<p>lake now drained, called the North Loch, on which
</p>
<p>there was a ferry-boat, to carry passengers to the
</p>
<p>opposite side, on which the new city is now built.
</p>
<p>The escape was effected towards the south-west
</p>
<p>part of the rock, and even there it must have
</p>
<p>been sufficiently hazardous ; after which, having
</p>
<p>carried his faithful domestic to a place of safe-
</p>
<p>ty, Albany betook himself across the sequestered
</p>
<p>fields, where extends the suburb of Stockbridge, to
</p>
<p>Newhaven. He must, indeed, have been aware
</p>
<p>of his danger; and the hazard which he encountered
</p>
<p>evidently proves that James had determined to
</p>
<p>bring him to execution. If Lindsay is to be cre-
</p>
<p>dited, the fact is indisputable. According to him,
</p>
<p>at nine o'clock on the morning which succeeded
</p>
<p>Albany's escape, a number of the Lords of the
</p>
<p>Council proceeded to the Castle, to arrange the

</p>
<p>ceive the King's commands as to the place where
</p>
<p>it was to be done. But they found the garrison
</p>
<p>in a commotion, and James thus unwillingly on
</p>
<p>liis part saved from a double act of fratricide.
</p>
<p>They were astonished when they learned the cause ;
</p>
<p>and not a few of them feared that the Duke
</p>
<p>might be able, at some future period, to take am-
</p>
<p>ple revenge for their enmity. There were among
</p>
<p>them, however, some who rejoiced at Albany's
</p>
<p>flight, and who hoped that they would yet see
</p>
<p>him in prosperous circumstances. The King was
</p>
<p>the principal person who lamented the Duke's
</p>
<p>flight, his fears being excited by the prediction of
</p>
<p>the pretended witch, and still thinking that his life
</p>
<p>was in danger as long as his brother lived. The
</p>
<p>only proceeding now instituted against Albany
</p>
<p>was the sentence of forfeiture, which gratified the
</p>
<p>Homes and Hepburns, the original exciters of the
</p>
<p>quarrel, but made the power of the minions by
</p>
<p>whom James was surrounded, and who in this
</p>
<p>instance had done their utmost to ruin Albany,
</p>
<p>the more exposed to a complete overthrow.
</p>
<p>But it must not be concealed that Albany's
</p>
<p>Bubsequent conduct justifies the supposition that
</p>
<p>he was a considerable party in the confederacy
</p>
<p>against the King. Those transactions, however,
</p>
<p>will be noticed in the sequel. In the midst of
</p>
<p>several negociations with Edward of England,
</p>
<p>James devoted himself to his favourite pursuits.
</p>
<p>The turbulent state of England made the wars
</p>
<p>between the two countries less frequent, and Scot-
</p>
<p>land was for a period in a state of comparative
</p>
<p>tranquillity. The Castle of Stirling became at

<p>this time the King's chief residence, and his taste
</p>
<p>for architecture prompted him to adorn that ancient

</p>
<p>seat'^'of Scottish royalty with elegant buildings.
</p>
<p>He founded in it a college of secular priests, called
</p>
<p>the Chapel-Royal, which consisted of a dean or
</p>
<p>provost, an archdean, a subdean, a treasurer,
</p>
<p>chanter, subchanter, and other officers ; and the
</p>
<p>deanery of the Chapel- Royal was awarded to the
</p>
<p>Bishops of Galloway ex officio, on which account,
</p>
<p>perhaps, it was, that during the establishment of
</p>
<p>the Episcopal Church of Scotland, and after the
</p>
<p>foundation of the See of Edinburgh, the Bishops
</p>
<p>of Galloway followed in the order of precedence
</p>
<p>after the two Archbishops of St Andrew's and Glas-
</p>
<p>gow and the Bishop of Edinburgh, the others rank-
</p>
<p>ing according to the order of their consecration.
</p>
<p>The original foundation of the Chapel-Royal of Stir-
</p>
<p>ling by James III. consisted of eight ecclesiastics
</p>
<p>and three singing-boys ; but he afterwards doubled
</p>
<p>the number, and it consisted eventually of sixteen
</p>
<p>ecclesiastics and six singing-boys. The reason as-
</p>
<p>signed by Lindsay of Pitscottie for this increase
</p>
<p>of the foundation is illustrative of the habits of
</p>
<p>James. " He doubled them, " says that writer,
</p>
<p>" to the eflFect that they should be ever ready,
</p>
<p>the one half to pass with him wherever he pleas-
</p>
<p>ed, that they might sing and play to him, and
</p>
<p>hold him merry ; and the other half should remain
</p>
<p>at home, in the said chapel, to sing and pray for
</p>
<p>him and his successors. " Among other new edi-
</p>
<p>fices which James erected in the Castle, besides
</p>
<p>repairing many that were hastening to decay, he
</p>
<p>built the noble hall still entire, which in those days
</p>
<p>was deemed a magnificent structure, called the

</p>
<p>to the fashion of the age ; and at the distance of
</p>
<p>nearly four centuries it is not much decayed. It
</p>
<p>may be Iiere observed, that the College, or Cha-
</p>
<p>pel-Royal, founded by James III., was demolish-
</p>
<p>ed in 1594, by his successor James VI., when the
</p>
<p>present chapel was erected, which is now employ-
</p>
<p>ed as the Armoury.
</p>
<p>But James, while thus employed in his favour-
</p>
<p>ite pursuits, was hastening to his ruin. He still
</p>
<p>persisted in his attachment to unworthy minions ;
</p>
<p>and Cochrane at length became his chief favour-
</p>
<p>ite and minister. Through him alone could the
</p>
<p>royal favour be procured ; and he who, as a ser-
</p>
<p>vant of the court, would have been suitably re-
</p>
<p>warded for the edifices he erected as master-mason
</p>
<p>by a pension, or by employment, was exalted by the
</p>
<p>imprudent King above those haughty nobles whose
</p>
<p>birth was their exulting boast. The height of power
</p>
<p>to which this upstart was elevated, procured for
</p>
<p>him numerous presents from the ambitious, the
</p>
<p>flattering, and those who sued for his influence ;
</p>
<p>and he soon acquired wealth which far exceeded
</p>
<p>that of any peer in the kingdom. All the pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings of government emanated through him ;
</p>
<p>nothing was transacted in the council without his
</p>
<p>consent ; and it was as dangerous to oppose this
</p>
<p>haughty minion, as it was impossible to satisfy his
</p>
<p>avarice by liberal presents. So great was his influence
</p>
<p>with James, that he was permitted to coin a species
</p>
<p>of money of his own, called black money ^ which
</p>
<p>was one of the causes of his own ruin and that of his
</p>
<p>master, the circulation of which often threatened to

</p>
<p>prohibited, he was wont to observe with haughti-
</p>
<p>ness, that " its circulation would cease the day
</p>
<p>he was hanged, "  an event which he, in the ful-
</p>
<p>ness of his security, considered improbable, but
</p>
<p>which was truly verified.
</p>
<p>This man had been long an object of hatred and
</p>
<p>contempt to the nobles, and his elevation was to
</p>
<p>them mortifying and humiliating ; but they were
</p>
<p>exasperated when they beheld him raised to the
</p>
<p>peerage, and the earldom of Mar purchased by him
</p>
<p>from the King's avarice, with the wealth which he
</p>
<p>had so ignobly acquired. The title thus bestowed
</p>
<p>on Cochrane by James was perhaps the most un-
</p>
<p>fortunate he could have selected ; and the nobles
</p>
<p>scowled with unrelenting hatred on what they
</p>
<p>were disposed to consider a marked insult to their
</p>
<p>order, in seeing James thus bestow on an ignoble
</p>
<p>minion the title borne by his own brother, who
</p>
<p>had so lately been a victim to his superstition.
</p>
<p>The execrations of the people followed this despi-
</p>
<p>cable elevation and increase of power, which,
</p>
<p>though now the infallible prelude to his certain
</p>
<p>destruction, the new Earl of Mar continued to
</p>
<p>exercise with his wonted tyranny, avarice, and in-
</p>
<p>solence. Those places and situations in the court
</p>
<p>which had formerly been awarded by the Scottish
</p>
<p>sovereigns to the sons of high-born men, were
</p>
<p>given by Cochrane to his own associates ; and the
</p>
<p>pious prelates and dignitaries of the Church la-
</p>
<p>mented that the simoniacal purchase of the va-
</p>
<p>cant benefices filled the coffers of the minion, and
</p>
<p>intruded into the sacred office unprincipled men,
</p>
<p>who were totally incapable and reckless of dis-

</p>
<p>assembled to consider the state of aflfairs, for
</p>
<p>they had found that personal access to James was
</p>
<p>almost impossible, he being vigilantly guarded by
</p>
<p>his favourite. The result was, the appointment
</p>
<p>of a deputation to wait on the King, with a repre-
</p>
<p>sentation of the state of the kingdom. The depu-
</p>
<p>tation was admitted into the royal presence, and
</p>
<p>its members tendered a detail of their grievances.
</p>
<p>They entreated James to dismiss those from his
</p>
<p>councils who cormpted him by their dishonesty
</p>
<p>and avarice, and promoted their own interests
</p>
<p>more than those of the kingdom. They besought
</p>
<p>him to trust to the loyalty of the nobles in the ad-
</p>
<p>ministration of justice and defence against his ene-
</p>
<p>mies ; and they proffered him their lives and for-
</p>
<p>tunes to maintain the country against every in-
</p>
<p>vader. But they declared, that if those requests
</p>
<p>were refused, they would be guiltless of whatso-
</p>
<p>ever misery and misfortunes the kingdom might
</p>
<p>be visited.
</p>
<p>The answer of James was far from being satis-
</p>
<p>factory. He informed them, that those who coun-
</p>
<p>selled him in the government were peers like
</p>
<p>themselves ; and that those who attended him
</p>
<p>pleased him for the time, because he could not see
</p>

</p>
<p>appertaining to the defence of the government,
</p>
<p>and the preservation of the liberties of the king-
</p>
<p>dom.
</p>
<p>The nobles pretended to assent to this reply,
</p>
<p>while, by their crafty dissembling, they were con-
</p>
<p>cealing their resentments. It is unfortunately too
</p>
<p>true, that James, like his predecessors, had fre-
</p>
<p>quently been harassed by their tendency to faction ;
</p>
<p>and unanimity in the national councils of Scotland
</p>
<p>is a thing to be wholly unlooked for in the history
</p>
<p>of its sovereigns. Even on occasions of great na-
</p>
<p>tional emergency, when they were in the field, and
</p>
<p>about to draw the sword against the invaders of
</p>
<p>their liberties, a trivial dispute about precedence
</p>
<p>often excited a furious contention, which weaken-
</p>
<p>ed their attachments, and too frequently ended in
</p>
<p>disasters. Much more so it was in the national
</p>
<p>councils, where a mutual jealousy invariably exist-
</p>
<p>ed among them, and when the independence of
</p>
<p>feudal power often provoked to retaliations and
</p>
<p>aggressions which were not forgotten for genera-
</p>
<p>tions. It was probably on these accounts, that
</p>
<p>James felt an attachment to his minions, whose ob-
</p>
<p>sequiousness afibrded a striking contrast to the tur-
</p>
<p>bulence and haughty spirit of his peers ; but the
</p>
<p>misfortunes of the King was, that he knew not
</p>
<p>how to accommodate himself to circumstances 
</p>
<p>he forgot, what his grandfather James I. well
</p>
<p>knew, that men vested with the feudal power
</p>
<p>were likely, when exasperated, to become danger-
</p>
<p>ous enemies, and gladly seize the first opportunity
</p>
<p>to rid themselves of the obnoxious controul of
</p>
<p>those whom they despised, and by whom their own

<p>ambitious purposes were frustrated.

</p>
<p>animosities, they were collected, and firm in
</p>
<p>their purposes : and they were shortly to exhibit
</p>
<p>one of those defiances of the regal authority, which
</p>
<p>are conspicuous in the Scottish annals of every
</p>
<p>reign. From the reign of the first, as it has been
</p>
<p>well remarked, to the termination of that of the fifth
</p>
<p>James, the Scottish nobles were accustomed to seize
</p>
<p>occasions when they set no limits to the ebullitions
</p>
<p>of their resentment. That their proceedings were
</p>
<p>unconstitutional, and insults to the government,
</p>
<p>cannot be doubted, inasmuch as the camp and the
</p>
<p>field of battle too frequently witnessed their mu-
</p>
<p>tual dissensions, and the interests of their coun-
</p>
<p>try were neglected to gratify their revenge. But
</p>
<p>those proceedings strikingly mark the state of
</p>
<p>the times ; and the nobles of Scotland were war-
</p>
<p>riors, not statesmen. Unaccustomed to the forms
</p>
<p>of debate in the day of peace, and in the assembly
</p>
<p>of the states, they oftener appealed to the sword
</p>
<p>than to reason. From the constitution of the Par-
</p>
<p>liaments, they were too liable to the royal influence ;
</p>
<p>and it was not to be thought that men, whose edu-
</p>
<p>cation unfitted them for other scenes than those
</p>
<p>of strife and warfare, could contend in the as-
</p>
<p>semblies of the nation with the spiritual peers,
</p>
<p>whose habits fitted them for declamation, and who
</p>
<p>would more willingly coincide with the sovereign,
</p>
<p>the source of all their dignities. It can hardly,
</p>
<p>then, be a subject of surprise, that many disgrace-
</p>
<p>ful actions are recorded in the pages of their his-
</p>
<p>tory, which, in their impatience of controul, ge-
</p>
<p>nerally terminated in misfortune and blood.

<p>after his remarkable escape from the Castle of Edin-
</p>
<p>burgh, proceeded directly to France, where he
</p>
<p>ir. DEATH OF JAMES III. 93
</p>
<p>was honourably received by Louis XI. So little
</p>
<p>did his disgrace with James affect his interests,
</p>
<p>that all his expenses were defrayed from the French
</p>
<p>treasury; and, although, married to Lady Catharine
</p>
<p>Sinclair, daughter of the Earl of Orkney, who was
</p>
<p>still alive, he scrupled not to form a matrimonial
</p>
<p>alliance with Anne daughter of the Count of Au-
</p>
<p>vergne. A misunderstanding had in the mean-
</p>
<p>while taken place between England and Scotland,
</p>
<p>occasioned most probably by Edward discontinuing
</p>
<p>to pay the marriage-portion of the Princess Ce-
</p>
<p>cilia, according to the terms of the treaty, to whom
</p>
<p>the eldest son of James, the Duke of Rothsay,
</p>
<p>was betrothed. Tired of his wife, Albany pass-
</p>
<p>ed over into England, where he found the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish sovereign exasperated at the Scots, and the
</p>
<p>Borders ravaged by mutual aggressions and for-
</p>
<p>ays. This was in 1482, two years before Ed-
</p>
<p>ward's brother, the Duke of Gloucester, after-
</p>
<p>wards the notorious Richard IIL, had been ap-
</p>
<p>pointed lieutenant-general of the North, and placed
</p>
<p>at the head of the army against the Scots. In 1480,
</p>
<p>when Richard first received this appointment,
</p>
<p>hostilities had not actually commenced, but he
</p>
<p>was ordered to have the army in readiness for the
</p>
<p>ensuing year. On that year the campaign began,
</p>
<p>and the English army entered Scotland, where
</p>
<p>they burnt sixty villages, sailed up the river Forth,
</p>
<p>captured eight vessels, and consigned to the flames
</p>
<p>the village of Blackness, on the southern shores
</p>

<p>is the castle of that name ; after which the in-

<p>paign ended with little glory on either side, for
</p>
<p>while the English were in the Firth, the famous
</p>
<p>Admiral Andrew Wood of Largo destroyed se-
</p>
<p>veral English vessels, and the Scottish Borderers
</p>
<p>carried fire and sword into England. On the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing year, 1482, the same in which Albany
</p>
<p>proceeded to England, the English were not dis-
</p>
<p>posed to relinquish the war, but were preparing
</p>
<p>for another invasion. Instigated by the artifi-
</p>
<p>ces of the unprincipled Gloucester, Albany, who
</p>
<p>seems to have considered his affairs as despe-
</p>
<p>rate, hesitated not to form a treaty with Edward
</p>
<p>IV. disgraceful to liimself and to his country, in
</p>
<p>which he styles himself " Alexander King of Scot-
</p>
<p>land, " and promises to perform homage for his
</p>
<p>kingdom to the English King, from whom he re-
</p>
<p>ceives it, cedes to Edward several of the Border
</p>
<p>counties, relinquishes the town of Berwick, and
</p>
<p>finally, promises to marry the princess Cecilia, " pro-
</p>
<p>vided he could clear himself of other women,"  a
</p>
<p>precaution highly necessary in his case, as he had
</p>
<p>already two wives alive. Edward promised to assist
</p>
<p>him in reducing Scotland, and to maintain him on the
</p>
<p>throne. Such was the secret treaty between Ed-
</p>
<p>ward and Albany, aided by the perfidious Glou-
</p>
<p>cester, who commanded the English army. The
</p>
<p>pretended causes of the war were, that the Earl
</p>
<p>of Douglas was still kept in exile, deprived of his
</p>
<p>honours,  ^that the Prince of Scotland (Duke of
</p>
<p>Rothsay) was to be delivered into the hands of the
</p>
<p>English monarch till his marriage with Cecilia,

<p>Roxburgh, Coldingham, and other fortresses on the

<p>Borders,  and that he refused to do homage to Eng-

</p>
<p>into England before a certain day  the castle of
</p>
<p>Berwick surrendered  otherwise the war was to
</p>
<p>commence.
</p>
<p>Those demands were of course refused by James,
</p>
<p>and the war was proclaimed. Albany, deluded by
</p>
<p>the English monarch, and allured by the prospect
</p>
<p>of a crown, joined the army of Edward under
</p>
<p>Gloucester, which assembled at Alnwick in Nor-
</p>
<p>thumberland, and amounted to 22,000, or, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to some, 40,000 men. The van of the army
</p>
<p>was led by Henry Percy, Earl of Northumber-
</p>
<p>land. Albany and Gloucester were at the head
</p>
<p>of the middle division ; and several of the English
</p>
<p>lords commanded the minor detachments.
</p>
<p>The first object of attack was Berwick, which
</p>
<p>had been in the hands of the Scots since it had
</p>
<p>been ceded to them by Henry IV. when a refu-
</p>
<p>gee in Scotland. Thither Gloucester directed his
</p>
<p>march, and his formidable army appeared sudden-
</p>
<p>ly on the river-side, over against the town. As
</p>
<p>the town made no resistance, it was immediately
</p>
<p>seized ; but the garrison in the Castle, refused to
</p>
<p>capitulate. Lord Stanley, Sir John EIrington,
</p>
<p>treasurer of the Household, and Sir William Parr,
</p>
<p>were left with 4000 men to carry on the siege ;
</p>
<p>and Gloucester, with the rest of the army, ac-
</p>
<p>companied by Albany, marched towards Edin-
</p>
<p>burgh.

<p>movements of the English army, than he proceed-
</p>
<p>ed to defend his kingdom. It was in the month
</p>
<p>96 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>of July 14S2 that the royal standard was display-
</p>
<p>ed on the Borough Muir near Edinburgh, the usual
</p>
<p>rendezvous of the Scottish armies, and there fifty
</p>
<p>thousand men ranged themselves under the ban-
</p>
<p>ner of their sovereign. The discontented nobles
</p>
<p>readily took the field with their retainers ; but
</p>
<p>they had privately resolved to perform some bold
</p>
<p>deed, and revenge themselves on a sovereign towards
</p>
<p>whom their resentments were almost incurable.
</p>
<p>The King, little suspecting their intentions, or
</p>
<p>that the friends of Albany were among them, put
</p>
<p>himself at the head of his army. He caused some
</p>
<p>pieces of artillery to be conveyed from the Castle ;
</p>
<p>but the discontented nobles were again exasperat-
</p>
<p>ed when they saw Cochrane intrusted with the
</p>
<p>command. This imprudence of the King was in-
</p>
<p>deed inexcusable. In marching against the com-
</p>
<p>mon enemy, it was his object rather to conciliate
</p>
<p>those feudal peers, whose retainers, if commanded
</p>
<p>by their chieftains, would set at defiance the King
</p>
<p>himself, than to increase their disaffection by the
</p>
<p>odious presence and pomp of Cochrane, which
</p>
<p>were considered as additional insults. But they
</p>
<p>stifled their resentments, and the Scottish warriors
</p>
<p>directed their course towards the Borders. They
</p>
<p>marched first to Soutra, in East Lothian, whence
</p>
<p>they proceeded to Lauder, a village in the Merse,
</p>
<p>or Berwickshire, where they encamped for the
</p>
<p>night between the church and the village.
</p>
<p>On the morning after their arrival at Lauder, a
</p>
<p>secret council of the peers assembled. The old
</p>
<p>church of Lauder was the place of meeting  a

<p>nortl) side of the town, opposite Lauder Fort, built
</p>
<p>by Edward I., suniamed Longshanks, during hie
</p>
<p>campaigns in Scotland. The chief nobles men-
</p>
<p>tioned who were present, were the Earls of Argyle,
</p>
<p>Angus, Huntly, Orkney, and Crawford, Lords
</p>
<p>Hume, Fleming, Gray, Drummond, Hailes, and
</p>
<p>Seton, Lord Evandale the Chancellor, and certain
</p>
<p>bishops. The ostensible object of their meeting
</p>
<p>was to consider what was to be done for the de-
</p>
<p>fence of the kingdom, and whether or not they
</p>
<p>ought to proceed with the King to the Borders ;
</p>
<p>but in reality to devise some means of ridding
</p>
<p>themselves of the favourites, and of obtaining pos-
</p>
<p>session of James' person.
</p>
<p>This council convened early in the morning,
</p>
<p>without the knowledge of the King. It was ob-
</p>
<p>served by some of the peers, says Lindsay, that
</p>
<p>James was " not their King, nor guided by them
</p>
<p>in their councils, but had elevated upstarts to the
</p>
<p>rank of nobles  that he had forfeited and banished
</p>
<p>the Duke of Albany his brother, and slain the
</p>
<p>Earl of Mar  and that Cochrane, a mason, had
</p>
<p>been raised to his dignity, which was an insult
</p>
<p>not to be endured. " A speech is reported by
</p>
<p>Buchanan to have been delivered by the Earl of
</p>
<p>Angus, in which he inveighs against the King's
</p>
<p>government and his favourites. Lord Gray, how-
</p>
<p>ever, opened the dangerous debate with the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing fable. " The mice, " said he, " consulted
</p>
<p>what measures they sliould adopt to escape from
</p>
<p>the cat, their inveterate and tyrannical enemy. It
</p>
<p>was proposed that a bell should be hung from her
</p>
<p>neck, to give due warning of her approach ; but

</p>
<p>enough to fasten the bell. " * No sooner had
</p>
<p>this fable been delivered by Gray, which the peers
</p>
<p>present failed not to apply to themselves, than An-
</p>
<p>jj:us, in whose veins the blood of the House of
</p>
<p>Douglas flowed, instantly exclaimed, " / shall bell
</p>
<p>the cat. " From this phrase, Angus was after-
</p>
<p>wards surnamed, in the homely phraseology of the
</p>
<p>country, Archibald Bell-the-Cat. A murmur of
</p>
<p>approbation ran throughout the assembly ; and se-
</p>
<p>veral of the peers, laying their hands on their
</p>
<p>ewords, exclaimed, " To our arms against the
</p>
<p>public enemy. " The result of their deliberation
</p>
<p>was, that the King's person should be secured, and
</p>
<p>conducted back to the Castle of Edinburgh ; and
</p>
<p>that Cochrane, with the other favourites, should
</p>
<p>be seized and hanged over the Bridge of Lauder.
</p>
<p>The council, however, was not kept so secret,
</p>
<p>but that it came to the knowledge of the King,
</p>
<p>who felt no inconsiderable alarm on account of
</p>
<p>the meeting at so early an hour. He rose in
</p>
<p>gi'eat fear from his couch, and asking, what
</p>
<p>was to be done ? summoned Cochrane to his
</p>
<p>presence. Cochrane attended, and, after consult-
</p>
<p>ing for a little with the King, he was sent to the
</p>
<p>council to observe their movements, and learn the
</p>
<p>nature of their deliberations. He repaired to the
</p>
<p>church where the peers were assembled in his
</p>
<p>usual pomp, little anticipating that he was de-
</p>
<p>voted to destruction. He was attended, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to Pitscottie, by three hundred men, all clad
</p>
<p>in white livery, with black fillets, and armed with
</p>
<p>battle-axes, that they might be known as the

<p>retainers of the new Earl of Mar. His own dress
</p>
<p>displayed his upstart magnificence. He was clad
</p>
<p>in a riding-cloak of black velvet, and wore a
</p>
<p>chain of gold around his neck worth five hun-
</p>
<p>dred crowns. His hunting-horn was enriched with
</p>
<p>gold at both ends, and a precious stone glit-
</p>
<p>tered in the centre. His helmet was carried be-
</p>
<p>fore him, overlaid with gold. * In this pomp
</p>
<p>he proceeded to the church of Lauder, where the
</p>
<p>peers were assembled, and, approaching the door,
</p>
<p>he commanded one cf his attendants to knock
</p>
<p>with great authority. Sir Robert Douglas of
</p>
<p>Lochleven stood guard within, who, on inquiring
</p>
<p>the cause of this rude noise, was answered by
</p>
<p>Cochrane  " 'Tis I, the Earl of Mar." Rejoic-
</p>
<p>ing at this fortunate circumstance, for which they
</p>
<p>ardently wished, Cochrane and soma of his attend-
</p>
<p>ants were ordered to be admitted. Angus instant-
</p>
<p>ly advanced towards him, and seizing him by the
</p>
<p>gold chain which hung around his neck, he twist-
</p>
<p>ed it with such firmness as nearly to strangle Coch-
</p>
<p>rane, exclaiming, " A rope would become thee
</p>
<p>better." f Douglas of Lochleven seized his hunt-
</p>
<p>* Lindsay's description of this minion's profusion is
</p>
<p>amusing. " Himself was clad in a riding-pie of black
</p>
<p>velvet, with a great chain of gold about his neck to the
</p>
<p>value of five hundred crowns; and four blowing-horns
</p>
<p>with both the ends of gold and silk, set with precious
</p>
<p>stones. His horn was tipped with fine gold at every end,
</p>
<p>and a precious stone, called a beryl, hanging in the midst.
</p>
<p>This Cochrane had his heument (helmet) borne before

<p>him overgilt with gold, and so were all the rest of his
</p>
<p>horns ; and all his pallions were of fine canvas of silk, and

<p>ing horse, and told him that " he had been too
</p>
<p>long a hunter of mischief. " Cochrane, finding
</p>
<p>himself thus roughly handled, asked, " My Lords,
</p>
<p>is this jest or earnest?" To which they replied,
</p>
<p>" Thou shalt soon find that it is in good earnest;
</p>
<p>for thou and thy associates have too long abused
</p>
<p>the favour of our sovereign. No longer shalt thou
</p>
<p>enjoy thy greatness ; but thou and thy accomplices
</p>
<p>shall have your deserved reward. "
</p>
<p>They soon secured the new made Earl, after
</p>
<p>which they despatched some of their friends to the
</p>
<p>King's abode, who amused James with smooth
</p>
<p>speeches, while their followers were apprehend-
</p>
<p>ing Cochrane's associates. On Leonard, Ro-
</p>
<p>gers, Torphichen, Preston, (the only gentleman

</p>
<p>hands ; and, dragging them out to the bridge, be-

<p>odious, according to Buchanan, had those minions

<p>become, that the whole army exulted in their ex-
</p>
<p>ecution, exclaiming, " Hang them, the rogues ! "
</p>
<p>Nay, so anxious were the soldiers for their death,
</p>
<p>that, when ropes were wanted to bang them, so
</p>
<p>sudden had been the resolution to put them to
</p>
<p>death, they all offered their horse-bridles and bag-
</p>
<p>gage-tackle, and many of them strove to make the
</p>
<p>first offer. The execution, it would appear, was
</p>
<p>performed before the King's eyes. * Cochrane
</p>
<p>was brought out last, his hands bound with a rope.

<p>Angus is reported to have said to Cochrane:  " This

<p>Here, however, ho exhibited his empty pride. He
</p>
<p>desired to have the rope exchanged for one of the
</p>
<p>silken cords of his own tent ; hut he was answer-

<p>ed, that he was a traitor, and deserved no better.

<p>He was conducted to the bridge, and hanged

<p>above his companions. *
</p>
<p>Sir John Ramsay of Balmain, a young man, was
</p>
<p>the only one of the King's favourites who escaped
</p>
<p>the indignant resentment of the peers. He leaped
</p>
<p>on the King's saddle, and clasped his person, and
</p>
<p>was saved at the earnest request of James himself,
</p>
<p>who pleaded for him on account of his extreme
</p>
<p>youth, he being only eighteen years of age. The
</p>
<p>genius and accomplishments of this youth had re-
</p>
<p>commended him to James ; and he was destined
</p>
<p>to be forfeited for his attachment to his master,
</p>
<p>after the disaster of Bannockburn or Sauchie. He
</p>
<p>was created Lord Bothvvell by the King ; and, in
</p>
<p>148S-4, he sat in Parliament as a peer by that
</p>
<p>title, f
</p>
<p>Having thus rid themselves of the odious fa-
</p>
<p>vourites, the nobles proceeded to the King, whose
</p>
<p> It is proper to mention, that the bridge of Lauder, at
</p>
<p>which this execution took place, is not the present one 
</p>
<p>it having been erected within the last century. The piles
</p>
<p>of the old one may be observed at some distance.

<p>Ramsay of Balmain, Bart. Member of Parliament for the

</p>
<p>of Halley, in Yorkshire, Feb. 12. 1806, in the 90th year

<p>person they resolved to secure, as all confidence
</p>
<p>between him and them was now ended. The
</p>
<p>house in which James was seized is still standing.*
</p>
<p>He was conveyed to the Castle of Edinburgh,
</p>
<p>where he was placed under a respectful restraint,
</p>
<p>and the army dismissed, until he should give am-
</p>
<p>ple security that he would not revenge the death
</p>
<p>of his favourites, to which he evinced, for a consi-
</p>
<p>derable time, the most obstinate repugnance, f
</p>
<p>Such was the issue of the campaign of the Scots
</p>
<p>against the English under Gloucester, which af-
</p>
<p>forded an opportunity for the Scottish nobles to
</p>
<p>neglect the defence of their country for the grati-
</p>
<p>fication of their resentments. It was a boisterous
</p>
<p>ebullition of passion, similar instances of which
</p>
<p>are frequently to be found in the Scottish annals.
</p>
<p>But, at the same time, it must not be denied that
</p>
<p>the imprudence of James was great, and that, if
</p>
<p>he depended on his nobles for assistance against
</p>
<p>the common enemy, he ought to have removed his
</p>
<p>minions from the camp, and trusted to the valour
</p>
<p>of his army. It may be true, however, after all,

<p>that though he had done so, the campaign would
</p>
<p>still have terminated ingloriously. Tlie partisans
</p>
<p>of Albany were numerous in the army, and the
</p>
<p>remembrance of the King's studied neglect might
</p>
<p>have induced them to yield the contest, and to
</p>
<p>have consented to terms not the most advanta-
</p>
<p>geous for their country. It was a remarkable in-
</p>
<p>stance of the power and influence which the aris-

<p>tocracy possessed over their followers, tliat the
</p>
<p>King was conveyed to the Castle of Edinburgh
</p>
<p>without a single murmur of the army.
</p>
<p>The accusations against those favourites, for
</p>
<p>their trials were despatched in the most summary
</p>
<p>manner, were, 1. Of causing the King to execute
</p>
<p>his brother, John Earl of Mar. 2. That they had
</p>
<p>excited the King against, and caused him to banish
</p>
<p>his brother, Alexander Duke of Albany. 3. That
</p>
<p>they had sowed dissensions between the King and
</p>
<p>his nobles. 4. That they had enticed him to su-
</p>
<p>perstition, witchcraft, and magic, to the offence of
</p>
<p>God, and dishonour of religion. And, lastly, that
</p>
<p>they had persuaded him to coin a certain kind of

<p>brass, of no value, which the people called black

</p>
<p>SIR THOMAS THE RYMEK.
</p>
<p>The English army under Richard of Gloucester,
</p>
<p>and accompanied by Albany, marched to Edin-
</p>
<p>burgh, having already obtained possession of Ber-
</p>
<p>wick. In that city they found affairs in confu-
</p>
<p>sion ; the King a prisoner in the Castle, and the
</p>
<p>administration of the government assumed by a
</p>
<p>party of the peers. They encamped at Restalrig,
</p>
<p>in the vicinity of the city.
</p>
<p>At Albany's request, Gloucester spared the citi-
</p>
<p>zens from being pillaged by the English army, and
</p>
<p>Albany himself was pardoned by the acting go-
</p>
<p>vernment, on returning to his allegiance. The
</p>
<p>approach of Gloucester to Edinburgh resembled
</p>
<p>a splendid triumph rather than an invasion. In-
</p>
<p>stead of carrying the treaty between Edward and
</p>
<p>Albany into effect, which purported to place the
</p>
<p>latter on the throne, the conduct of the English

</p>
<p>is not a little mysterious. Gloucester demanded
</p>
<p>ir. DEATH OF JAMES III. 105
</p>
<p>from James tlie performance of his stipulations
</p>
<p>with England; hut the King, heinii; a prisoner, re-
</p>
<p>turned no answer. At length, however, a new
</p>
<p>treaty was concluded between James and Edward,
</p>
<p>and after a short residence in the Scottish metro-
</p>
<p>polis, Gloucester returned to London. It was
</p>
<p>stipulated, that the marriage between the Duke
</p>
<p>of Rothsay and the Princess Cecilia, should still
</p>
<p>take place ; and the citizens of Edinburgh, who
</p>
<p>had all along remained firm in their loyalty, be-
</p>
<p>came bound to repay Edward the dowry he had
</p>
<p>formerly given in contemplation. As the marriage
</p>
<p>eventually failed, the citizens honourably discharged
</p>
<p>their obligations. Berwick was perpetually sur-
</p>
<p>rendered to the English.
</p>
<p>For nine months the King had been confined
</p>
<p>in the Castle of Edinburgh, where Albany, overcome
</p>
<p>by the importunities of the queen, resolved to
</p>
<p>set his brother at liberty. Accordingly, aided by
</p>
<p>the citizens of Edinburgh, the fortress was sur-
</p>
<p>prised, and the King released from his durance.
</p>
<p>For this service, a reconciliation was eft'ected be-
</p>
<p>tween James and the Duke, and the latter had
</p>
<p>the titles of Earl of Mar and Lord of Garioch
</p>
<p>conferred upon him, " as the reward of his loyalty,
</p>
<p>affection, and service. " It was on this occasion,
</p>
<p>too, that Edinburgh received her most important
</p>
<p>charter from a grateful sovereign, confirming her
</p>
<p>ample privileges. The office of hereditary sheriflf
</p>
<p>within the city, with complete jurisdiction, was
</p>
<p>conferred on the provost, with all the fines and
</p>
<p>forfeitures arising from the administration of that
</p>
<p>office. The magistrates and council were also

<p>empowered to make laws at pleasure for the wel-

<p>fare of the town ; they were exempted from cer-
</p>
<p>106 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>tain duties ; and entitled to exact customs at the
</p>
<p>port of Leith. In return for this ample charter, all
</p>
<p>that the King demanded from the civic rulers was
</p>
<p>the annual celebration of a funeral mass for the
</p>
<p>repose of the souls of his predecessors, himself,
</p>
<p>and successors, in the collegiate church of the
</p>
<p>city dedicated to St Giles.
</p>
<p>But this apparent reconciliation between James
</p>
<p>and Albany was of no long continuance, and the
</p>
<p>latter soon returned to his former intrigues and
</p>
<p>practices. The superstitious piety of James in-
</p>
<p>duced him to propose a pilgrimage to the relics of
</p>
<p>St John at Amiens in France ; and for this pur-
</p>
<p>pose he obtained a safe-conduct from Edward to
</p>
<p>pass through England on his way. In the Parlia-
</p>
<p>ment which met in December 1482, and which
</p>
<p>appears to have been entirely under Albany's in-
</p>
<p>fluence, a recommendation was given to James,
</p>
<p>on the 11th December, to constitute the Duke
</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General and Governor of the kingdom
</p>
<p>during his absence. With this recommendation
</p>
<p>he complied, though subsequent events occurred
</p>
<p>which hindered James from performing his devo-\
</p>
<p>tions at the shrine of St John. But Albany, not-
</p>
<p>withstanding his power, knew well that his situa-
</p>
<p>tion was precarious ; his conduct, seemingly in-
</p>
<p>fluenced by the treasonable treaty he had made
</p>
<p>with Edward when in exile, and his desire for the
</p>
<p>crown, had disgusted the nobles, and excited the
</p>
<p>jealous suspicions of James. Perceiving that the
</p>
<p>loyal party were increasing, he secured a con-
</p>
<p>siderable military force, and contrived to excite
</p>
<p>disturbances in the West and Eastern Marches,

</p>
<p>in the hope that a war would ensue between the
</p>
<p>two countries. With this view he sent Archibald
</p>
<p>II. DEATH OF JAMES III. 107
</p>
<p>Earl of Angus, surnamed Bell-the-Cat, from the
</p>
<p>affair at Lauder, Lord Gray, and Sir James Liddel
</p>
<p>of Halkerstone, to Edward, to renew the former
</p>
<p>treaty, the object of which was to depose James,
</p>
<p>to procure troops from Edward to conquer Scot-
</p>
<p>land, and to place him on the throne, by the title of
</p>
<p>Alexander IV. This disgraceful treaty was accord-
</p>
<p>ingly renewed by Edward  Albany again engaged
</p>
<p>to marry one of that prince's daughters, and to
</p>
<p>assist him against France  the exiled Earl of
</p>
<p>Douglas was to be restored to his possessions 
</p>
<p>and Gloucester and the Earl of Northumberland
</p>
<p>were to invade Scotland. What might have been
</p>
<p>the result of this treasonable agreement, it is im-
</p>
<p>possible to say ; but the death of Edward, the
</p>
<p>murder of his two nephews in the Tower by the
</p>
<p>unprincipled Gloucester, afterwards Richard IIL,
</p>
<p>who began his infamous reign with blood, 
</p>
<p>terminated at once those intrigues of lawless
</p>
<p>ambition ; and Richard was too much occupi-
</p>
<p>ed with the discords of England, to find leisure
</p>
<p>to further the wild and treasonable schemes of
</p>
<p>Albany and his partisans. The Duke soon af-
</p>
<p>terwards retired into England, where, finding all
</p>
<p>hopes of assistance from Richard in vain, and
</p>
<p>again endeavouring to excite a disturbance in Scot-
</p>
<p>land, he finally departed for France, where he fell
</p>
<p>a few years afterwards at a tournament, leaving
</p>
<p>one son by the Countess of Auvergne, who inhe-
</p>
<p>rited his unfortunate title, and who was destined
</p>
<p>to misgovern Scotland in the minority of James V.
</p>
<p>The honours and estates of Albany were annexed

<p>to the crown in 14-87, but James did not long en-

<p>joy these accessions.
</p>
<p>Without, however, detailing minutely the vari-
</p>
<p>108 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>ous circumstances of this calamitous reign, which
</p>
<p>belong rather to the general history than to a de-
</p>
<p>tached narrative like the present, it is proper to
</p>
<p>observe, that the final departure of Albany did not
</p>
<p>abate the zeal of his partisans, and that of James'
</p>
<p>enemies. Had the King possessed the activity
</p>
<p>and dignity of some of his predecessors, his private
</p>
<p>pursuits would have been honourable to his taste ;
</p>
<p>and the g^reat hall in Stirling Castle, and the cha-
</p>
<p>pel in the same fortress, united to his taste for
</p>
<p>music and the fine arts, would have been lasting
</p>
<p>memorials of his princely munificence among a
</p>
<p>people at that time on the threshold of improve-
</p>
<p>ment. The long-stifled resentments, however, were
</p>
<p>speedily to break out with overwhelming fury ;
</p>
<p>and Scotland was doomed to experience the scourge
</p>
<p>of an unnatural discord, induced by the imprudence
</p>
<p>of its sovereign, and the turbulent ambition of its
</p>
<p>nobles.
</p>
<p>Several of the King's proceedings, after his re-
</p>
<p>lease from the Castle of Edinburgh, had given
</p>
<p>great offence to the chief leaders of the nobility.
</p>
<p>He continued to live in ignoble privacy; nor was
</p>
<p>he cured of his attachment to favourites by the
</p>
<p>fierce burst of resentment which had characterized
</p>
<p>the affair of Lauder Bridge. Though Albany had
</p>
<p>departed, his spirit was left behind, and James had
</p>
<p>not the prudence to provide against its excesses.
</p>
<p>After the final retreat of that prince, he issued an
</p>
<p>order that no nobleman should wear arms within the
</p>
<p>precincts of the court ;  his appointment of Ram-
</p>
<p>say, the favourite who had escaped at Lauder, to

<p>ed with no friendly feelings; and a number of the
</p>
<p>nobles believed, or pretended to believe, that it
</p>
<p>II. DEATH OF JAMES III. 109
</p>
<p>was the design of James to plare Scotland under
</p>
<p>English influence. Though this last accusation
</p>
<p>was utterly groundless, it served as a sufficient
</p>
<p>pretext for their traitorous designs ; and a con-
</p>
<p>federacy was speedily formed, consisting of the
</p>
<p>Earls of Angus, Lennox, and Argyle, Lords
</p>
<p>Home, Hailes, Drummoud, Lyle, and Gray ; the
</p>
<p>object of which was to receive again the King's
</p>
<p>person, and to appoint the young Duke of Roth-
</p>
<p>say regent of the kingdom.
</p>
<p>This confederacy was formed in 1485, but its
</p>
<p>leaders delayed their intentions for some time, till
</p>
<p>the rupture between them and the King became
</p>
<p>irreconcileable. In the meantime, James obtained
</p>
<p>possession of the Castle of Dunbar from the Eng-
</p>
<p>lish; and in 1486 a treaty was concluded between
</p>
<p>him and Henry VH. of England, who had de-
</p>
<p>feated and slain the usurper Richard HI. at the
</p>
<p>battle of Bosworth Field. But James experienced
</p>
<p>a calamity that year in the death of his amiable
</p>
<p>queen, Margaret of Denmark, who was consigned
</p>
<p>to the tomb in the venerable abbey of Cambus-
</p>
<p>kenneth. The confederacy, however, continued,
</p>
<p>though considerably disturbed by the league with
</p>
<p>England ; and each of the nobles who composed it
</p>
<p>had his own peculiar causes of discontentment. The
</p>
<p>Earl of Angus was the very soul of the associa-
</p>
<p>tion, and Lord Home was induced to join it from
</p>
<p>a motive of private revenge. As it was the King's
</p>
<p>intention to endow the college or chapel-royal at
</p>
<p>Stirling, he purposed to bestow on it the revenues
</p>
<p>of the rich priory of Coldingham, at that time va-
</p>
<p>cant. This priory was of great antiquity and

<p>in 1098, and was dedicated to the Virgin ; at the
</p>
<p>consecration Edgar assisted in person, and caus-
</p>
<p>ed a house to be built for himself, the remains
</p>
<p>of which are still to be seen, and are called
</p>
<p>Edgars Walls. Besides the extensive lands and
</p>
<p>other immunities belonging to this monastery, which
</p>
<p>were very considerable, the prior had a right to
</p>
<p>the teinds or tithes of no fewer than twenty-four
</p>
<p>parishes. A vacancy at this time induced James
</p>
<p>to seize on all its temporalities for the endow-
</p>
<p>ment of his college at Stirling ; and accordingly, he
</p>
<p>caused an act of parliament to be passed, discharg-
</p>
<p>ing all his subjects to attempt any thing against
</p>
<p>the union of the chapel-royal at Stirling with the
</p>
<p>priory of Coldingham, under the penalties of high
</p>
<p>treason.
</p>
<p>This mortally offended the Homes and Hep-
</p>
<p>burns, as one of the former families had generally
</p>
<p>held the priory, and they had been long accustom-
</p>
<p>ed to view its lands, temporalities, and titles, as
</p>

<p>quarrel that of tlie faction at large. Their emis-
</p>
<p>saries sent abroad rumours, that the King was aim-
</p>
<p>ing at arbitrary power,  that notwithstanding all
</p>
<p>his protestations he was not to be trusted  that
</p>
<p>he had begun his attacks on their property by in-
</p>
<p>vading and seizing the ancient privileges of the
</p>
<p>Homes, which he had grasped more from hatred
</p>
<p>and avarice, than from any desire to increase the
</p>
<p>endowment of his chapel  and that, in short, he
</p>
<p>meditated a deep and terrible revenge for the
</p>
<p>affair at Lauder Bridge.
</p>
<p>These misrepresentations of the King's inten-
</p>
<p>tions were sufficient to kindle anew the rank-
</p>
<p>ling animosities of the factious nobles. Angus, sur-
</p>
<p>named Bell-the-Cat, was, however, the chief ring-
</p>
<p>leader of the conspiracy, and his principal object was
</p>
<p>to get a person of sufficient influence to preside
</p>
<p>over his associates. In an invasion conducted by
</p>
<p>Albany and the exiled Earl of Douglas in 1484,
</p>
<p>the latter nobleman had been taken prisoner at
</p>
<p>Lochmaben fair, and had been ordered by James
</p>
<p>to spend the remainder of his days in the Abbey
</p>
<p>of Lindores in Fife. In this peaceful retreat Dou-
</p>
<p>glas first found happiness. To this nobleman, now
</p>
<p>old and infirm, Angus advised the conspirators to
</p>
<p>apply to head them ; but the venerable Douglas was
</p>
<p>dead to ambition, and instead of encouraging them
</p>
<p>in their designs against the destroyer of his house,
</p>
<p>he exhorted them to abandon their rebellious in-
</p>
<p>tentions, expressing great contrition for his own
</p>
<p>past conduct. Finding, however, that his remon-
</p>
<p>strances were disregarded, this magnanimous no-

</p>
<p>them not to enter the association. * This great man
</p>
<p>survived this application only a few months. He
</p>
<p>died in peace in the Abhey of Lindores, without
</p>

<p>tors were left to their own resources ; nor do they

<p>were, in reality, the principal traitors. Home had

<p>motives. To them were afterwards added Hunt-
</p>
<p>ly, Errol, Marischal, and Lord Glammis, who,
</p>
<p>with the others already mentioned, constituted the
</p>
<p>association. The pretext for this conspiracy was
</p>
<p>as ridiculous as it was false, namely, that James
</p>
<p>intended to place his kingdom under English in-
</p>
<p>fluence. The real causes were, hatred to the King,
</p>
<p>to dethrone and imprison him, and to elevate his

<p>son the Duke of Rothsay to the throne or the re-
</p>
<p>gency. Yet the circumstances of the kingdom fa-

<p>Scotland was to become a province of England, and
</p>
<p>to be governed by an English force.
</p>
<p>With the King there remained the Earls of Craw-
</p>
<p>ford, Monteith, Rothes, Athole, Caithness, Su-
</p>
<p>therland, and Buchan ; Lords Forbes, Lovat, Max-
</p>
<p>well, Ruthven, Erskine, Boyd, and Kilmaurs,
</p>
<p>with some other persons of great power, not then
</p>
<p>elevated to the peerage. James, indeed, appears
</p>
<p>to have been acquainted with the designs of the
</p>
<p>conspirators; but he wanted energy to prepare him-
</p>
<p>self against the popular ferment. His conduct at
</p>
<p>this time is remarkable, and made his enemies
</p>
<p>charge the descendant of a race of heroes with
</p>
<p>cowardice ; but, though the first of his name against
</p>
<p>whom this odious imputation was made, his con-
</p>
<p>duct by no means justifies the accusation. His
</p>
<p>laxity or negligence, however, only caused his ene-
</p>
<p>mies to parade about the country with greater bold-
</p>
<p>ness, while he was shut up in the Castle of Stir-
</p>
<p>ling (some say Edinburgh) pursuing his favourite
</p>
<p>studies, heedless of the strong combination, and
</p>
<p>depending on the protection of the law, which the
</p>
<p>affair at Lauder 13ridge might have taught him
</p>
<p>would most certainly be treated with contempt.
</p>
<p>The factious peers assembled at Edinburgh, and
</p>
<p>the malignity of Buchanan has in consequence as-
</p>
<p>persed the character of James. He asserts that
</p>
<p>the King, who had affected to forget Angus' con-
</p>
<p>duct at Lauder, invited him to the Castle, and pro-
</p>
<p>posed to him to cut off the rebel chiefs at one blow.
</p>
<p>But Angus, who conceived this to be a snare for
</p>
<p>his own destruction, though he seemingly reason-
</p>
<p>ed with the King on the impolicy of this measure,

</p>
<p>apprehend them, disclosetl to his associates the in-
</p>
<p>tentions of the Kinf(, and joined them with his re-
</p>
<p>tainers. But the false colouring of this affair 
</p>
<p>that the King intended to assassinate them, is evi-
</p>
<p>dent from the facts, and James was always averse
</p>
<p>to shed hlood.
</p>
<p>James, however, was at last roused from his
</p>
<p>lethargy. The confederates took the field, and
</p>
<p>all the counties south of the Forth were under
</p>
<p>their controul. The Earl of Angus, the only chief
</p>
<p>who could have assisted him in reducing the rebels,
</p>
<p>was at their head, and appointed places of meet-
</p>
<p>ing for all those who were inclined to enlist under
</p>
<p>their banners. Although summoned by the Kin^
</p>
<p>to answer for their conduct at the proper tribunals,
</p>
<p>the insurgents treated his citations with contempt,'
</p>
<p>tore them in pieces, abused and maltreated the
</p>
<p>messengers, and openly spurned the royal autho-
</p>
<p>rity. The populous counties of Fife and Forfar
</p>
<p>were in a state of revolt ; and those alone continu-
</p>
<p>ed faithful to the King, north of the Grampian
</p>
<p>Mountains.
</p>
<p>Distrusting all the Lowland counties, James
</p>
<p>resolved to visit the North, where the inhabi-
</p>
<p>tants remained true to their allegiance. He first,
</p>
<p>however, proceeded to Stirling, with the Duke
</p>
<p>of Rothsay, his son, then a youth of fifteen years
</p>
<p>of age ; and, having sufficiently provided the Cas-
</p>
<p>tle with military stores, he delivered the young
</p>
<p>prince to the care of Shaw of Sauchie, the go-
</p>
<p>vernor, charging him to let no man enter the Castle
</p>
<p>till his return, nor to let the prince go out on any
</p>
<p>pretence wliatsoever. He then returned to Edin-

</p>
<p>vcrnor all his money ; after which he proceeded
</p>
<p>to Leith, on liis journey to the northern counties,
</p>
<p>and embarked in a vessel belongin^^ to Sir An-
</p>
<p>drew Wood, to convey him over the Frith to
</p>
<p>the opposite shore. Unfortunately, the vessel
</p>
<p>in which he embarked had been engaged in the
</p>
<p>Flemish trade, and a report was immediately
</p>
<p>circulated, that, overcome by his fears, he had
</p>
<p>quitted the kingdom and fled to Flanders
</p>
<p>The insurgents, taking advantage of the consterna-
</p>
<p>tion, mustered their forces, and advanced to Leith.
</p>
<p>There they seized and rifled the royal baggage,
</p>
<p>which was in readiness to be sent after the King,
</p>
<p>and found a large sum of money, which proved of
</p>
<p>great consequence to them in their affairs. They
</p>
<p>then proceeded to arm themselves from the King's
</p>
<p>stores, and advanced to the Castle of Dunbar,
</p>
<p>which they immediately took by surprise. They
</p>
<p>afterwards ravaged all the southern counties, par-
</p>
<p>ticularly the Lothians and Tweeddale, rifling and
</p>
<p>plundering the houses of all who were not engaged
</p>
<p>in the insurrection.
</p>
<p>While the insurgents were conducting them-
</p>
<p>selves in this tumultuous manner, the King, who
</p>
<p>had summoned the counties of Fife, Forfar, and
</p>
<p>the district of Strathearn to attend his banner at a
</p>
<p>certain day, proceeded northward to Aberdeen.
</p>
<p>In his journey he held courts of justice, and was
</p>
<p>every where received with aft'ection, particularly
</p>
<p>in the districts under the influence of tiie Earls of
</p>
<p>Huntly, Errol, and Marischal, who were devoted
</p>
<p>to his interests. The northern clans readily obey-

<p>themselves under the royal banner. The chiefs
</p>
<p>in those parts were busily engaged in mustering
</p>
<p>116 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>their retainers, and the King had the prospect of
</p>
<p>a numerous army under his control. But as every
</p>
<p>day brought more alarming reports of the proceed-
</p>
<p>ings of the insurgents in the south, James had no
</p>
<p>time left for deliberation. He hastened to Perth,
</p>
<p>which he appointed the place for the mustering of
</p>
<p>his army, followed by his uncle, the Earl of Athol,
</p>
<p>the Earls of Huntly, Crawford, and Errol, with
</p>
<p>many northern chiefs, and, indeed, all the array of
</p>
<p>the northern counties. There he was joined by
</p>
<p>Lord Lindsay of the Byres,  an officer who had
</p>
<p>acquired considerable military reputation in France,
</p>
<p>with a thousand horsemen and three thousand foot.
</p>
<p>From this Baron it was, according to Pitscottie,
</p>
<p>that the King received the present of the fatal
</p>
<p>courser; and in presenting him to the King, he
</p>
<p>observed, that " if his Majesty were reduced to
</p>
<p>extremity, either to flee or pursue, that horse
</p>
<p>would surpass every other in Scotland, if the rider
</p>
<p>kept his saddle." Lord Ruthven, too, who was
</p>
<p>at that time Sheriff of Strathearn, ancestor of the
</p>
<p>Earls of Gowrie, brought a thousand gentlemen on
</p>
<p>horseback to the King's assistance, well armed, and
</p>
<p>provided with spears, a thousand bowmen, and a
</p>
<p>thousand armed men with long swords and coats of
</p>
<p>mail :  three thousand in all from the loyal town
</p>
<p>of Pertli. The King found himself at the head of
</p>
<p>30,000 men, and with this army he set out for
</p>
<p>Stirling against the rebels.
</p>
<p>The insurgents being in possession of all the
</p>
<p>counties south of the Forth, had not, on their part,
</p>
<p>been idle. They had mustered their forces in the
</p>
<p>county of Linlithgow, or West Lothian, and had

<p>encamped near Blackness Castle, on the southern
</p>
<p>shores of the Frith of Forth. The fleet under the
</p>
<p>II. DEATH OF JAMES III. 117
</p>
<p>coniinaiul of Sir Andrew Wood of Largo liaving
</p>
<p>sailed up the Forth, the royal anny passed over in
</p>
<p>those vessels ; and having landed at Blackness, in
</p>
<p>April 1488, the King was joined by the few in
</p>
<p>tlie soutliern counties who continued in their al-
</p>
<p>legiance. The contest was about to be decided
</p>
<p>by a battle, and an indecisive skirmish had taken
</p>
<p>place, in which several of the loyal chiefs emi-
</p>
<p>nently distinguished themselves ; but the insur-
</p>
<p>gents appear to have been aware of the superiority
</p>
<p>of the King's forces, and consented to an accom-
</p>
<p>modation. Probably both parties were not suffi-
</p>
<p>ciently exasperated against each other, and there-
</p>
<p>fore shrank from the last resource of shedding the
</p>
<p>blood of their countrymen. The Earl of Athole,
</p>
<p>the King's uncle, a nobleman trusted by both par-
</p>
<p>ties, effected a negociation, and surrendered him-
</p>
<p>self as a hostage into the hands of the rebels.
</p>
<p>Though the terms of this accommodation are not
</p>
<p>mentioned by our historians, and indeed their whole
</p>
<p>account of this transaction is confused and contra-
</p>
<p>dictory, yet the fact of this temporary treaty is
</p>
<p>beyond dispute ; and we know that Athole was
</p>
<p>confined for his loyalty in the Castle of Dunbar. *

<p>* There is a document first published by Dr Henry, in

</p>
<p>The two armies were disbanded, though the in-
</p>
<p>surgents continued to meet in detached parties ;
</p>
<p>and the King retired to the Castle of Edinburgh,
</p>
<p>his son, the Duke of Rothsay, being still in the
</p>
<p>Castle of Stirling, under the government of Shaw
</p>
<p>of Sauchie.
</p>
<p>Nothing could be more unfortunate for the af-
</p>
<p>fairs of James than this ill-timed lenity, which
</p>
<p>proceeded from his timidity, and his averseness toi|
</p>
<p>shed blood. As in religious disputes, decision is,
</p>
<p>the only course with frantic sectaries, who gene-
</p>
<p>rally care little for the lenity which tolerates, and
</p>
<p>must therefore be opposed by the resolution which
</p>
<p>expels, so, in political insurrections, the strong and
</p>
<p>salutary arm of power ought always to be exer-
</p>
<p>cised, and the faction crushed, ere it strengthens
</p>
<p>that spirit which, when excited, proceeds to the,
</p>
<p>most daring extremes. It is asserted by all our
</p>
<p>historians, that this timidity was fatal to James,
</p>
<p>and that by it he lost an opportunity which couldL,
</p>
<p>never be recalled. It was not likely that the dis-.
</p>
<p>contentment would be allayed by any concessions ;
</p>
<p>for concessions to insurgents are in reality virtual
</p>
<p>acknowledgments that their conduct is praisewor-
</p>
<p>path, in his Border History, suspects that the Bishop of
</p>
<p>Glasgovv( Blackadder), and theBishop of Dunkeld( Brown),
</p>
<p>favoured the insurgents, as they were connected with fa-
</p>
<p>milies attached to the Homes and Hepburns. The arti-
</p>
<p>cles chiefly relate to the young prince ; and it certainly
</p>
<p>does appear from them, that they had then got possession
</p>
<p>of his person. The last article is to this effect : " At al

<p>thy, and must only increase the insolence of their
</p>
<p>partisans. James ought at Blackness to have put
</p>
<p>down this dangerous association, ere its members
</p>
<p>dispersed with their prejudices inveterate, their
</p>
<p>resolutions the same to expel the sovereign, and
</p>
<p>increasing in strength during the brief cessation of
</p>
<p>hostilities, more especially as he was then support-
</p>
<p>ed by many powerful chiefs, particularly Huntly,
</p>
<p>Errol, Glammis, and Marischal, who afterwards
</p>
<p>deserted the royal cause, and joined the insur-
</p>
<p>gents.
</p>
<p>But the misfortunes of his house attended James
</p>
<p>in his series of disasters. He was indeed sen-
</p>
<p>sible of the advantages which public clamour gave
</p>
<p>to his enemies ; and had he possessed due discri-
</p>
<p>mination, he might have ruined their cause. He
</p>
<p>was still suspected, and the insurgents at length
</p>
<p>insisted on his abdication of the throne. It is un-
</p>
<p>fortunate that the terms of the negociation are
</p>
<p>only partially recorded, and that we have no other
</p>
<p>document than that entitled, " The Pacification of
</p>
<p>Blackness, " which almost exclusively relates to
</p>
<p>the guidance of the young prince, with only one
</p>
<p>article, that the King's '' maist noble person be at
</p>
<p>all tymes in honor, securitie, and fredome. " But
</p>
<p>the demands of the rebels being exorbitant, inas-
</p>
<p>much as they completely controlled the King in
</p>
<p>his administration, James had evaded or delayed
</p>
<p>their accomplishment. The rebels, on the other
</p>
<p>hand, insisted that the King had not fulfilled his
</p>
<p>terms of the treaty, and, whatever the terms were,
</p>
<p>it is certain they had some occasion for complaint,
</p>
<p>more especially when we consider that the peers

</p>
<p>ment of the terms on the part of the King is ex-
</p>
<p>pressly assigned by those peers as the cause of
</p>
<p>their defection. The error of James consisted in
</p>
<p>agreeing to any conditions which were exorbitant,
</p>
<p>and when he was able to defeat his enemies ; but

<p>he was certainly bound afterwards to fulfil them,

<p>and hence it was that the confederacy daily spread
</p>
<p>wider, till all the country south of the Grampians
</p>
<p>was in a state of revolt.
</p>
<p>The conduct of James, too, at this juncture, was
</p>
<p>not likely to eifect a reconciliation, and must
</p>
<p>necessarily have excited the suspicions of the in-
</p>
<p>surgents for their own personal safety. He had
</p>
<p>retired to the Castle of Edinburgh, where was all
</p>
<p>his treasure, and he proceeded to strengthen it
</p>
<p>with considerable activity. In the meantime, be-
</p>
<p>ing aware of the practices of the insurgents, he
</p>
<p>applied to the kings of England and France, and
</p>
<p>to the Pope, Eugenius VIII. for their interference;
</p>
<p>and the application was successful. This was most
</p>
<p>certain to rouse the fears of the confederates.
</p>
<p>The two monarchs threatened to raise armies
</p>
<p>for the aid of the Scottish King, and his Holiness
</p>
<p>appointed Adrian de Castello as his nuncio, at
</p>
<p>that time his Legate in England, and, according to
</p>
<p>Buchanan, a man of great learning, to effect a re-
</p>
<p>conciliation, and even to excommunicate the insur-
</p>
<p>gents, should they prove refractory. But those re-
</p>
<p>sources were too late, and the nuncio arrived when
</p>
<p>his interposition was in vain.
</p>
<p>Those proceedings of the King were viewed with

<p>alarm by the conspirators, who were beginning to
</p>
<p>find, that, notwithstanding the promising aspect of
</p>
<p>II. DEATH OF JAMES III. 121
</p>
<p>their affairs, they were not secure. They now saw
</p>
<p>that decision and activity were their only resources.
</p>
<p>It was not their interest to delay so long as to
</p>
<p>bring against themselves the armies of France and
</p>
<p>England, and they wished especially to anticipate
</p>
<p>tlie Nuncio's arrival, whose influence they dreaded
</p>
<p>most of all, because, were their practices to be de-
</p>
<p>nounced by the Church, it would have drawn from
</p>
<p>them a considerable number of adherents, through
</p>
<p>the fear of ecclesiastical censures. They, therefore,
</p>
<p>at once appeared in arms, and openly insisted on
</p>
<p>the King's resignation of the crown.
</p>
<p>Sensible, however, that their affairs must lan-
</p>
<p>guish, and their adherents dwindle, unless they
</p>
<p>were furnished with new pretexts for rebellion, and
</p>
<p>were headed by a person of authority, they had
</p>
<p>recourse to bold and daring proceedings. The
</p>
<p>Earl of Angus proposed that the Duke of Roth-
</p>
<p>say, the King's eldest son, should be placed at their
</p>
<p>head, and his proposal met with the most cheerful
</p>
<p>acquiescence. By involving him in their conspi-
</p>
<p>racy, they in a manner secured themselves ; for,
</p>
<p>should they be successful, their safety was evi-
</p>
<p>dent ; if unsuccessful, prudential reasons would re-
</p>
<p>strain the King from inflicting on them summary
</p>
<p>punishment. They now gave out that the King
</p>
<p>had a design on his son's life, which, in the state
</p>
<p>of popular feeling, was readily believed. The
</p>
<p>young prince had been consigned to the care of
</p>
<p>Shaw of Sauchie, governor of Stirling Castle, with
</p>
<p>strict orders from the King, that no one who was
</p>
<p>disaffected should be allowed to approach him, and
</p>
<p>that he should on no account be suffered to go

<p>out of the Castle. But that treacherous governor

</p>
<p>disregarded his sovereign's injunctions. He secretly
</p>
<p>favoured the conspirators, and he was prevailed
</p>
<p>upon, by the present of a considerable sum of money,
</p>
<p>to deliver the young prince into their hands, the
</p>
<p>defence of whose life, it was maintained, called
</p>
<p>them to arms, and whose name, thus associated
</p>
<p>with the confederates, sanctioned their designs.
</p>
<p>The youth was accordingly conducted to Linlith-
</p>
<p>gow, unconscious of their ultimate intentions, and
</p>
<p>Scotland was thus to behold a son constrained to
</p>
<p>league against his father and sovereign. With the
</p>
<p>money which they had found at Leith in the King's
</p>
<p>baggage the confederates contrived to supply them-
</p>
<p>selves with warlike stores ; and having obtained
</p>
<p>possession of the prince, whose name was now em-
</p>
<p>ployed to sanction all their actions, they took the
</p>
<p>field with their retainers.
</p>
<p>James, ignorant of this infamous conduct on the
</p>
<p>part of Shaw, seeing no other resource but war,
</p>
<p>again summoned the northern chiefs to attend his
</p>
<p>standard. The place of rendezvous is not men-
</p>
<p>tioned, but it was probably at or near Stirling,
</p>
<p>whither the King intended to proceed, to join
</p>
<p>those chiefs who were advancing from the north
</p>
<p>with their followers. The rebels in the meantime
</p>
<p>were assembling their forces in the same direction.
</p>
<p>By a fatality which seems to have attended him,
</p>
<p>James left the Castle of Edinburgh for Stirling,
</p>
<p>trusting to the fidelity of its governor, as it was also
</p>
<p>a fortress where he could be secure. This was
</p>
<p>another misfortune. His affairs were not then so
</p>
<p>desperate, and had he kept himself in Edinburgh
</p>
<p>Castle until the result of his applications to France

</p>
<p>the Papal Nuncio, he would stiJJ have been abJe

</p>
<p>to defeat the confederacy. He was in possession
</p>
<p>of the Castle of Blackness ; his Admiral, Sir An-
</p>
<p>drew Wood, commanded the river Forth; and
</p>
<p>his friends in the north were still numerous and
</p>
<p>powerful. But unconscious of Shaw's treachery,
</p>
<p>and believing, perhaps, that the Castle of Stirling
</p>
<p>was of more importance than that of Edinburgh,
</p>
<p>inasmuch as it commanded the only bridge over
</p>
<p>the Forth, and the great entrance into the High-
</p>
<p>lands, whence his northern subjects were to ad-
</p>
<p>vance, he left the metropolis. All that the conspir-
</p>
<p>ators wanted was to draw the King into the field.
</p>
<p>James proceeded to Stirling by Blackness, where
</p>
<p>he was joined by the Earls of Montrose and Glen-
</p>
<p>cairn, (who had been recently elevated to that earl-
</p>
<p>dom from the title of Lord Kilmaurs), the Lords
</p>
<p>Maxwell and Ruthven. As some of the chiefs
</p>
<p>had joined the insurgents, and as the junction of
</p>
<p>the northern clans with the King's troops had
</p>
<p>caused a considerable delay, a second negotiation
</p>
<p>was proposed, but without effect. The rebels, in
</p>
<p>order to induce the King to take the field, made
</p>
<p>a show of dismissing their army, while they were
</p>
<p>secretly mustering their forces for a decisive en-
</p>
<p>gagement. The King, in the meantime, arrived
</p>
<p>at Stirling, where he found a considerable num-
</p>
<p>ber of the northern clans assembled. Advancing
</p>
<p>to the Castle, he was astonished when he was not
</p>
<p>only refused admittance, but found the gates shut,
</p>
<p>and the guns pointed against his person. He in-
</p>
<p>quired for his son, and the perfidious governor at
</p>
<p>first said, that he could not be seen at that time.
</p>
<p>He soon learned, with astonishment, that lie was

</p>
<p>with the rebels ; and on upbraiding Shaw with his
</p>
<p>perfidy, he pretended that the prince had been
</p>
<p>124) CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>carried off by the conspirators against his inclination.
</p>
<p>But the King perceived the treachery. " Fy, trai-
</p>
<p>tor ! " said he, " thou hast deceived me ; but if I
</p>
<p>live, I shall be revenged on thee, and reward thee
</p>
<p>as thou deservest."
</p>
<p>In this extremity, and, according to some writ-
</p>
<p>ers, after crossing and recrossing the Forth, and
</p>
<p>making another attempt to gain admittance into
</p>
<p>the Castle, James lay that night in the town of
</p>
<p>Stirling, where he was speedily joined by all his
</p>
<p>army. While deliberating on the measures he
</p>
<p>should adopt, intelligence was brought him that
</p>
<p>the conspirators were then at Falkirk, and were
</p>
<p>advancing with their forces to Torwood,  a place
</p>
<p>famous in Scottish story as the retreat of the pa-
</p>
<p>triot Wallace, and at that time a forest of consi-
</p>
<p>derable extent. The King was now in a peculiar
</p>
<p>situation ; the Castle of Stirling was held out
</p>
<p>against him, the only place where he could have
</p>
<p>been secure ; and the army of the conspirators,
</p>
<p>by thus advancing in the direction of Torwood,
</p>
<p>could easily intercept him in any attempt to reach
</p>
<p>Edinburgh. Sir Andrew Wood, his admiral, had
</p>
<p>indeed sailed up the Forth as far as Alloa,  a
</p>
<p>town only seven miles from Stirling over land, but
</p>
<p>more than double that distance by water, on ac-
</p>
<p>count of the serpentine turnings and windings of
</p>
<p>the river, in that delightful carse or valley through
</p>
<p>which the Forth runs towards the ocean ; and that
</p>
<p>famous mariner would have sailed farther up the
</p>
<p>river, had there been sufficient depth of water for
</p>
<p>his vessels. The King could easily have retreated
</p>
<p>from Stirling by embarking in the Admiral's fleet,

<p>with danger ; and as it would have been interpret-

</p>
<p>ed by the insurgents as the result of timidity and
</p>
<p>cowardice, it would have increased their boldness,
</p>
<p>and done material injury to the royal cause. Situ-
</p>
<p>ated as James was, he liad no other alternative
</p>
<p>than either to embark in Wood's vessels, or to
</p>
<p>decide the contest by a battle ; and, after calling
</p>
<p>a council of the chiefs who followed the royal
</p>
<p>standard, he resolved to hazard the latter.
</p>
<p>It was in the month of June, and the forests of
</p>
<p>Stirlingshire were clothed in their summer foliage,
</p>
<p>when this unnatural and fatal contest was de-
</p>
<p>cided. The ground is sacred in the annals of
</p>
<p>Scottish song. Different, indeed, were the mo-
</p>
<p>tives which stimulated this array of Scotland's chi-
</p>
<p>valry, from those which prompted their illustrious
</p>
<p>ancestors under the banneis of Bruce. The in-
</p>
<p>surgents, who soon understood the purposes of the
</p>
<p>King, prepared also for battle, and passed the Car-
</p>
<p>ron, a small but remarkable rivulet in Stirlingshire,
</p>
<p>which rises in the parish of Fintry, almost in the
</p>
<p>centre of the isthmus between the Forth and
</p>
<p>Clyde, and falls into the Forth, a few miles below
</p>
<p>Falkirk. The associations connected with this
</p>
<p>brook are interesting in no ordinary degree. It was
</p>
<p>the boundary of the Roman empire, when that em-
</p>
<p>pire was in its glory, the famous wall of Antoni-
</p>
<p>nus running parallel to it for some miles. On its
</p>
<p>banks was the Roman structure called Arthur's
</p>
<p>Oven ; and there was fought a famous battle be-
</p>
<p>tween the Romans, and the Scots and Picts, in
</p>
<p>the fifth century. On its banks were performed
</p>
<p>the exploits of Ossian, the son of Fingal. Oscar,
</p>
<p>the son of Ossian, there signalized himself as a

<p>hero ; and the vale is yet pointed out by tradi-

<p>tion, where those ancient warriors contended with

</p>
<p>tlie beroe8 of the streams of Caros. There, with
</p>
<p>more certaiuty of truth, was fought the well known
</p>
<p>battle between Wallace and the English invaders,
</p>
<p>which succeeded the memorable interview between
</p>
<p>that patriot and Robert Bruce, disastrous to the
</p>
<p>Scottish arms. It is long, however, since the sil-
</p>
<p>very stream of the Carron rolled along amid the
</p>
<p>din of arms ; happy it is that the busy scenes of
</p>
<p>trade and the mechanical arts now distinguish its
</p>
<p>classic banks.
</p>
<p>The insurgents had encamped at the bridge
</p>
<p>over the Carron, near the Torwood, when the
</p>
<p>King led his army against them, and encamped at
</p>
<p>a small brook named Sauchie Burn, about two
</p>
<p>miles from the town of Stirling, and a mile south
</p>
<p>from the famous field of Bannockburn. If Lindsay
</p>
<p>of Pitscottie is to be credited, on the night before
</p>
<p>the battle, another attempt was made for a nego-
</p>
<p>tiation, which was also unsuccessful. The two
</p>
<p>armies met on a tract of land now termed Little
</p>
<p>Canglar, on the east side of Sauchie Burn. The
</p>
<p>army of the rebels was greatly superior to that of
</p>
<p>the King ; it consisted chiefly of Borderers inured
</p>
<p>to war, well armed and well disciplined ; and was
</p>
<p>consequently most unequally opposed by the Low-
</p>
<p>land royalists. The exact number of the two
</p>
<p>armies has not been ascertained ; the royal army
</p>
<p>has been estimated by some as containing 30,000
</p>
<p>men, that of the insurgents 18,000 ; but there is
</p>
<p>every reason to conclude, that the number of the
</p>
<p>royal army is greatly exaggerated, as it is uni-
</p>
<p>versally admitted, that the army of the insurgents
</p>
<p>was greatly superior to the royal forces.

</p>
<p>Lindsay of the Byres, appeared at the head of the
</p>
<p>army, wliich he divided into tliree several lines.
</p>
<p>The first, or vanguard, was commanded by the
</p>
<p>Earl of Menteith, Lords Erskine, Gray, Ruthven,
</p>
<p>Graham, and Maxwell, and consisted chiefly of
</p>
<p>Highlanders to the number of 10,000, armed with
</p>
<p>swords and bows ; the second line, or right wing,
</p>
<p>was headed by the Earl of Glencairn, and consist-
</p>
<p>ed of Highlanders, and troops from the Western
</p>
<p>counties ; the third, the left wing, or rear, in which
</p>
<p>was the greatest strength of the army, was com-
</p>
<p>manded by the Lords Boyd and Lindsay; and
</p>
<p>the main body, in which was the King himself, by
</p>
<p>the Earl of Crawford, all consisting of soldiers
</p>
<p>from Fife and Angus, Strathearn, and the district
</p>
<p>of Stormont.
</p>
<p>When the King beheld the approach of the re-
</p>
<p>bels, he called for the horse presented to him by
</p>
<p>Lindsay, and mounted him, to observe the dis-
</p>
<p>position of the rebels. Their army, which consist-
</p>
<p>ed chiefly of cavalry, was also divided into three
</p>
<p>separate lines. The first was composed of men
</p>
<p>from East-Lothian and the Merse, or Berwick-
</p>
<p>shire, led by Lords Hailes and Home ; the se-
</p>
<p>cond was under the command of Lord Gray, and
</p>
<p>consisted of men from Galloway and the Borders ;
</p>
<p>the third was under the nominal command of the
</p>
<p>Duke of Rothsay, though he was completely un-
</p>
<p>der the controul of the rebel Lords who belonged
</p>
<p>to this division, and consisted of men from West-
</p>
<p>Lothian, and other midland Lowland counties.

<p>military experience. As for James liimself, when
</p>
<p>he perceived the insurgents advancing with tlie
</p>
<p>128 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>royal banner displayed, and his own son at their
</p>
<p>head, he felt no inconsiderable alarm. The pro-
</p>
<p>phecy which had formerly preyed upon his mind,
</p>
<p>" that he should be put down, and destroyed by one
</p>
<p>of his own kindred, " now recurred, and, it is more
</p>
<p>than probable, influenced his subsequent conduct.
</p>
<p>The leaders of the royal amiy, fearing that the
</p>
<p>King's timidity would prove fatal, and also desir-
</p>
<p>ous of his safety, wished to remove him from the
</p>
<p>lines, but by that time the action had commenced.
</p>
<p>A dense shower of arrows from the West-Lothian
</p>
<p>men, and a keen attack from the Homes and Hep-
</p>
<p>bums, denoted the opening of the contest ; but
</p>
<p>they were successfully opposed by the first line
</p>
<p>of the royal army, and were beaten back with
</p>
<p>considerable loss. They were, however, instantly
</p>
<p>supported by the men of Annandale and the Bor-
</p>
<p>derers, who, with loud shouts, drove the King's
</p>
<p>first and second lines back to the third. This ad-
</p>
<p>vantage was decisive, though it is not accurately
</p>
<p>known how long the battle continued, or how
</p>
<p>many fell. Victory declai-ed for the rebels, and the
</p>
<p>King's army experienced a total rout. Glencairn,
</p>
<p>Ruthven, Erskine, Ramsay of Balmain, and other
</p>
<p>leaders of the royal army, were slain, and many
</p>
<p>were wounded. Such was the result of the la-
</p>
<p>mentable disaster at Sauchie Burn, which was
</p>
<p>fought on the 11th day of June 1488, the day of
</p>
<p>the Festival of St Barnabas.
</p>
<p>The King, whose courage had never been re-
</p>
<p>markable, now put spurs to his steed and fled.
</p>
<p>It was his endeavour to gallop across the carse or
</p>
<p>vale of Stirling to Alloa, where Wood's fleet lay

<p>the field of battle. As he was on the point of

<p>JI. DEATH OF JAMES III. 129
</p>
<p>crossing the rivulet of Bannockburn, near the vil-
</p>
<p>lage of Milltown, a mile eastward of the field, a
</p>
<p>woman happened to be drawing water with a
</p>
<p>pitcher from the stream. Alarmed at seeing a
</p>
<p>man in armour galloping furiously towards her,
</p>
<p>she threw down her pitcher, and fled for safe-
</p>
<p>ty. The noise startled the horse, and, leaping
</p>
<p>over the rivulet fit one spring, threw his inex-
</p>
<p>perienced rider from the saddle. The King, from
</p>
<p>his fall, was so stunned and bruised by the weight
</p>
<p>of his armour, that he fainted away, and seemed to
</p>
<p>all appearance dead. The accident happened with-
</p>
<p>in a few yards of a mill, and the miller and his wife
</p>
<p>came running in haste to the aid of the unfortunate
</p>
<p>horseman. Ignorant of his rank, they carried him
</p>
<p>into their house, and laid him in a corner, cover-
</p>
<p>ing him with a cloth to conceal him from any pur-
</p>
<p>suer. Having administered to him what remedies
</p>
<p>their house afforded, James recovered, and, feeling
</p>
<p>himself weak and greatly bruised, he called for a
</p>
<p>priest to hear his confession. The rustics inquired
</p>
<p>the name and quality of their guest, when James
</p>
<p>incautiously said, " I was your king this morning. "
</p>
<p>The miller's wife, overcome with astonishment,
</p>
<p>wrung her hands, and ran hastily to the door in
</p>
<p>alarm to search for a priest, as the King desired,
</p>
<p>to grant him absolution.
</p>
<p>The fate of the unfortunate monarch was de-
</p>
<p>cided by this incautious disclosure of his name and
</p>
<p>rank. A general rout had followed the battle,
</p>
<p>and the royal army fled in all directions, pursued
</p>
<p>by the victorious confederates. It had been the

<p>express desire of the Duke of Rothsay, when he

<p>intercept his flight ; but this, of coui-se, was little
</p>
<p>regarded by the victorious conspirators. It hap-
</p>
<p>pened, that at the very moment the miller's wife
</p>
<p>came out of the house exclaiming for a priest,
</p>
<p>some of the rebels who were following the rout
</p>
<p>which the King took in his flight, passed the house.
</p>
<p>According to Buchanan, though the statement
</p>
<p>wants proof, there were three who pursued the
</p>
<p>King very closely, Patrick Gray, the chief of that
</p>
<p>family, Kerr, and a priest named Borthwick. The
</p>
<p>pursuers, whoever they were, thus having disco-
</p>
<p>vered the object of their search, failed not to im-
</p>
<p>prove the opportunity. One of them exclaimed
</p>
<p>to the woman, " Here, I am a priest, lead me to
</p>
<p>the King. " He was accordingly admitted, and
</p>
<p>falling on his knees before James, asked him, if
</p>
<p>he thought he would yet live. " I might, *' re-
</p>
<p>plied the King, " if I had the attendance of a
</p>
<p>physician ; but give me absolution and the sacra-
</p>
<p>ment. "  " That I shall do readily, " said the vil-
</p>
<p>lain; and pulling out a dagger, stabbed the unfor-
</p>
<p>tunate monarch repeatedly in the heait, and then
</p>
<p>departed ; nor was the perpetrator of this atrocious
</p>
<p>act ever afterwards discovered.
</p>
<p>Beaton's Mill, said to be so called from a per-
</p>
<p>son of that name who then possessed it, the place
</p>
<p>where this villany was committed, is still to be
</p>
<p>seen, but is now converted into a dwelling-house.

<p>The lower parts of the walls are those which were

<p>erected at the time, the upper parts are of more

<p>of the place, which he was surprised to hear tal-
</p>
<p>lied in every particular with the historical nar-
</p>
<p>rative. He was even shown the particular cor-
</p>
<p>ner in which the King was slain. The house has
</p>
<p>been somewhat modernized, and converted from
</p>
<p>a mill into a dwelling-house. The lower part of
</p>
<p>the walls, however, are, to about a man's height,
</p>
<p>unaltered, and impressed with the appearance of
</p>
<p>great antiquity. A corner stone of the modem
</p>
<p>part of the fabric bears date 1667. The house is
</p>
<p>divided into two ends^ with separate doors, ac-
</p>
<p>commodating two families, and is thatched. It
</p>
<p>stands about fifty yards east of the road from
</p>
<p>Glasgow to Stirling, in the close neighbourhood
</p>
<p>of the new mill which had been substituted, when
</p>
<p>it was converted into a dwelling-house. "
</p>
<p>Some of the King's forces had retreated to the
</p>
<p>Torwood, and others to the town of Stirling. The
</p>
<p>conspirators betook themselves to Linlithgow, after
</p>
<p>resting all the night succeeding the battle in the
</p>
<p>field. The fate of the King was not then known,
</p>
<p>but in a short time rumours soon spread over the
</p>
<p>country of the assassination, aided by an additional
</p>
<p>report, that Rothsay was the murderer of his own
</p>
<p>father. The young prince, now King, was incon-
</p>
<p>solable when he heard of his father's death, yet,
</p>
<p>as it had not become public, he was not without
</p>
<p>hope. It was some days before he received cer-
</p>
<p>tain information, for if any of the conspirators knew
</p>
<p>it, they carefully concealed it from him. In the
</p>
<p>mean time, a person who came to Linlithgow, in-
</p>
<p>formed them that Admiral Wood's two vessels
</p>
<p>were traversing up and down the Frith, and it was

<p>still believed that the King had reached the fleet
</p>
<p>in safety. The rebel army forthwith proceeded to

</p>
<p>Leith, whence a message was sent from the young
</p>
<p>prince to Wood, desiring to know if the King was on
</p>
<p>board any of his vessels. Wood informed them that
</p>
<p>he was not, and gave them permission to searcli
</p>
<p>his ships. A second message was sent to him,
</p>
<p>desiring an interview ; but Wood refused to go on
</p>
<p>shore without hostages for his safety. These being
</p>
<p>delivered in the persons of Lords Seton and Fle-
</p>
<p>ming, who were sent on board the Admiral's ves-
</p>
<p>sels in the custody of his brother, Wood pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded to Leith, and presented himself before the
</p>
<p>prince. Mistaking the Admiral, from his noble
</p>
<p>appearance, for his father, whom it would appear
</p>
<p>he had seldom seen, no sooner did he see him,
</p>
<p>than he exclaimed, with tears in his eyes, " Sir,
</p>
<p>are you my father ? "  " I am not your father, "
</p>
<p>replied Wood, " but I was your father's faithful
</p>
<p>servant, and shall be so till I die, and an enemy to
</p>
<p>those who have been the occasion of his downfal. "
</p>
<p>Some of the nobles who had been in the conspi-
</p>
<p>racy, asked him, if he knew any thing of the King,
</p>
<p>or where he was ; to wliich he replied, that he
</p>
<p>knew not. They then asked him who the persons
</p>
<p>were that put off from the field at Alloa, and went
</p>
<p>on board his vessels in boats. " I and my bro-
</p>
<p>ther, " replied Wood, " wlio were ready to have
</p>
<p>risked our lives in defence of the King." They still
</p>
<p>asked him, if he really was not in the vessel, and
</p>
<p>W^ood boldly said, " He is not ; but would to God
</p>
<p>he were there, for he would be in safety. I would
</p>
<p>defend and keep him free from all the vile traitors
</p>
<p>who have cruelly murdered him, and I hope to
</p>
<p>see the day when they will be rewarded as they

</p>
<p>agreeable to the persons present, it is probable that
</p>

</p>
<p>he would never have returned to his vessels alive,
</p>
<p>had there been no hostages for his security. And in-
</p>
<p>deed, as his absence was longer than was expected,
</p>
<p>his brother was becoming impatient, and would
</p>
<p>have executed the two hostages without ceremony,
</p>
<p>as they testified at their return, had the Admiral
</p>
<p>been delayed any longer. * At last the body of the
</p>
<p>unfortunate James was discovered, and carried to
</p>
<p>Stirling Castle, where it lay till it was interred in
</p>
<p>the Abbey of Cambuskenneth, beside the body of
</p>
<p>his late Queen. The spot is still shown, though there
</p>
<p>is no monument. So sincerely did the young prince,
</p>
<p>afterwards James IV., repent of his proceedings
</p>
<p>against his father, that the keenest remorse preyed
</p>
<p>upon his mind. " Residing for some time," says
</p>
<p>an historian, " in the Castle of Stirling, the priests
</p>
<p>of the chapel-royal deplored in his presence, and
</p>
<p>even in their prayers, the death of their founder ;
</p>
<p>and the solemnity of religion increased the mental
</p>
<p>gloom of his son, who resolved, with amiable su-
</p>
<p>perstition, to wear constantly in penance an iron
</p>
<p>girdle, the weight of which he increased with his
</p>
<p>years. The Roman Pontiff spared the youth and
</p>
<p>innocence of Jamps, but darted the thunder of the
</p>
<p>Vatican at the rebellious barons, whose arms had
</p>
<p>been pointed against their sovereign." James him-

<p>Lindsay of Pitscottie's History, " can have no claim to
</p>
<p>truth, James being sixteen years of age, and knowing his
</p>
<p>father perfectly. " This, however, does not follow ; for
</p>
<p>it is certain that he had not seen his father for some time ;
</p>
<p>and as it was believed that he was in Wood's fleet, he might

<p>rebellion and misfortune, was not free from the
</p>
<p>calamities of his House ; and the fatal disaster of
</p>
<p>Flodden deprived Scotland once more of a sove-
</p>
<p>reign, who fell in the field of battle with the flower
</p>
<p>of Scottish chivalry.
</p>
<p>It may be observed, in conclusion, that no execu-
</p>
<p>tions followed this unnatural rebellion. In the first
</p>
<p>Parliament of James IV, a remarkable act was
</p>
<p>passed, entitled, " The proposition of the debate of
</p>
<p>the field of Stirling," which secured the conspira-
</p>
<p>tors, and justified their successful rebellion, by enu-
</p>
<p>merating various pretended accusations against the
</p>
<p>late King. So completely did the conspirators
</p>
<p>gain upon the King by the force of flattery, that
</p>
<p>he caused all the peers to be summoned who
</p>
<p>had been leaders in the royal army, to the number
</p>
<p>of twenty-eight. The most remarkable of these
</p>
<p>trials was that of Lord Lindsay of the Byres, who
</p>
<p>was put first on the list. It ended, after a consi-
</p>
<p>derable altercation, and some rough and energetic
</p>
<p>replies from Lindsay, in his acquittal, on account
</p>
<p>of some imperfection in the indictment. He was
</p>
<p>ordered to enter his recognisances that he would
</p>
<p>appear on a certain day. He was, however, soon
</p>
<p>afterwards sent a prisoner, by the command of the
</p>
<p>King, to the Castle of Rothsay, in the Island of
</p>
<p>Bute, where he remained a whole year. The
</p>
<p>superior talents and administration of James IV.
</p>
<p>relieved the nation from its former distractions.
</p>
<p>His character was brightened by many illustri-
</p>
<p>ous qualities ; the spirit of Scottish chivahy re-
</p>
<p>vived ; and a reign of considerable glory in the

<p>Scottish annals ensued, till the dark cloud of mis-

<p>INTRODUCTORY NOTICE.
</p>
<p>The following acconnt of the remarkable con-
</p>
<p>fipiracy of Count Fiesco at Genoa is reprinted from
</p>
<p>the narrative of the celebrated Cardinal De Retz,
</p>
<p>who flourished in the 17th century. John Francis
</p>
<p>Paul de Gondi, Cardinal de Retz, one of the most
</p>
<p>remarkable political characters in French history,
</p>
<p>was the son of Philip Emanuel de Gondi, General
</p>
<p>of the Galleys, and descended from a Florentine
</p>
<p>family. He was born at Montmirel, a town in
</p>
<p>France, in 1G14. He was compelled by his father
</p>
<p>to enter the Church against his inclination, and
</p>
<p>had several abbacies conferred upon him wlien yet
</p>
<p>in his youth. In 1643, he became a Doctor of the
</p>
<p>Sorbonne, and coadjutor to his uncle who was Arch-
</p>
<p>bishop of Paris. But, although an ecclesiastic, no-
</p>
<p>thing could be at greater variance with his profes-
</p>
<p>sion than the life of this extraordinary man. In
</p>
<p>his Memoirs, written by himself, and perhaps one
</p>
<p>of the most remarkable works translated into our
</p>
<p>language, though now almost forgotten, he has most
</p>
<p>graphically pourtrayed his transactions. " These
</p>
<p>Memoirs," says Voltaire, " are written with an air

</p>
<p>of greatness, an impetuosity of genius, and an in-
</p>
<p>equality, which are the image of his conduct. He
</p>
<p>composed these in his retirement with the impar-
</p>
<p>tiality of a philosopher, but of one who had not
</p>
<p>always been a philosopher. He neither spares
</p>
<p>himself nor others. He gives portraits of all those
</p>
<p>who acted a considerable part in the intrigues of
</p>
<p>the Frondi, which are often very natural, but
</p>
<p>sometimes spoilt by a remnant of acrimony, vani-
</p>
<p>ty, and enthusiasm." * He was a man who, not-
</p>
<p>withstanding his life of debauchery, and while la-
</p>
<p>bouring under its consequences, preached to the
</p>
<p>people, and was almost adored by them. His
</p>
<p>whole conduct partook of the spirit of faction and
</p>
<p>sedition. He fought duels, entered into every
</p>
<p>species of licentiousness, and at the age of twenty-
</p>
<p>three was himself the very soul of a conspiracy
</p>
<p>against Cardinal Richelieu. It was, however, dur-
</p>
<p>ing the ministry of the famous Cardinal Mazarine,
</p>
<p>who both hated and feared him, that he was
</p>
<p>in his element. By pretending great devotion in
</p>
<p>the discharge of his episcopal duties, he imposed
</p>
<p>upon the people, and became popular by his pro-
</p>
<p>fessions of zeal of the public welfare. It is said
</p>
<p>that he was the first bishop who canied on a war
</p>
<p>without the pretence of religion ; and, as he was
</p>
<p>one of the most violent opposers of the Court, he

<p>once entered the French Parliament with a dagger

</p>
<p>even a rude outline of the tumultuous, daring, and
</p>
<p>intriguing life of this remarkable man. On coal-
</p>
<p>escing with the Court, he procured a Cardinal's
</p>
<p>Hat in 1651, but, as he was esteemed a deserter
</p>
<p>by his party, he soon lost his popularity. He was
</p>
<p>imprisoned in the Castles of Vincennes and Nantz,
</p>
<p>whence he made his escape, and fled first to Spain,
</p>
<p>and afterwards to Rome, whern he was received
</p>
<p>with great favour as the enemy of Mazarine. He
</p>
<p>was present, and assisted at the elevation of Alex-
</p>
<p>ander VII. to the Pontificate ; but, finding his
</p>
<p>Holiness not much disposed to promote his
</p>
<p>views, he left Italy, and wandered throughout
</p>
<p>Holland, Flanders, and England. He was at this
</p>
<p>time Archbishop of Paris, having succeeded his
</p>
<p>uncle in the sole government of that See. Weary,
</p>
<p>however, of his wanderings and exile, he return-
</p>
<p>ed to France after the death of Mazarine, in
</p>
<p>1661, and made his peace with the Court by
</p>
<p>vacating his Archbishopric, as a recompense for
</p>
<p>which he received the Abbacy of St Denis. He
</p>
<p>was afterwards at Rome, and assisted at the
</p>
<p>consecration of Clement IX. He returned his

<p>Cardinal's Hat to Clement X, but that Pontiff re-

<p>fused to accept it. He now retired from the

</p>
<p>died at Paris in 1679, in the 66th year of his age,
</p>
<p>regretted by men of worth and integrity. His
</p>
<p>conduct towards the close of his career, was dif-
</p>
<p>ferent from that of his former life ; but it has been
</p>
<p>often asserted, and perhaps with truth, that " he
</p>
<p>did not quit the world till it had quitted him, and
</p>
<p>that disappointed ambition, rather than elevation,
</p>
<p>was the motive of his retreat. "
</p>
<p>It was in the retirement of St Denis that De Retz
</p>
<p>wrote his Memoirs. The best French editions are
</p>
<p>those of Amsterdam, 1718, in five volumes octavo ;
</p>
<p>1719, in seven vols. 12mo ; and of 1731, four vols,
</p>
<p>small 8vo. They were translated into English by
</p>
<p>Peter Davall, of the Middle Temple, a barrister,
</p>
<p>afterwards a Master in Chancery, and, at the time
</p>
<p>of his death in 1763, Accomptant-General of that
</p>
<p>Court. They were published at London in 1723,
</p>
<p>in four vols. 12mo, by the famous bookseller Jacob
</p>
<p>Tonson, dedicated to Congreve the poet, who en-
</p>
<p>couraged Davall's publication. The Memoirs were
</p>
<p>also published in 1774, in three vols. 12mo. It
</p>
<p>is, however, from Tonson's edition of 1723, trans-
</p>
<p>lated by Davall, that the following narrative is
</p>
<p>taken, as the name of that eminent bibliopole is a

</p>
<p>found it substantially correct, and it has been there-
</p>

</p>
<p>thography and structure of a few of the sentences.
</p>
<p>This account of the conspiracy of Fiesco by the
</p>
<p>Cardinal de Retz, is inserted among some other
</p>
<p>pieces, now also forgotten, in the fourth volume of
</p>
<p>Tonson's edition translated by Davall.
</p>
<p>It is needless to say any thing here respecting
</p>
<p>the conspiracy of Fiesco, which is one of the most
</p>
<p>remarkable and daring adventures recorded in
</p>
<p>history. There is another account of it, in a rare
</p>
<p>volume of historical tracts, entitled " A Collection
</p>
<p>of Select Discourses out of the most Eminent Wits
</p>
<p>of France and Italy, " 8vo, London, 1678 ; but it
</p>
<p>appears to be a translation, and a very inferior one,
</p>
<p>of the Cardinal's narrative, from Signior Mascardi,
</p>
<p>but the translator's name is not given. It is, how-
</p>
<p>ever, noticed occasionally in the notes. Dr Robert-
</p>
<p>son has given a very graphic though confused ac-
</p>
<p>count of this famous conspiracy, in his History of
</p>
<p>Charles V, and he has made considerable use of De
</p>
<p>Retz's narrative. This performance by the Cardi-
</p>
<p>nal, it may be observed in conclusion, was written
</p>
<p>when he was only eighteen years of age, and may be
</p>
<p>considered as characteristic of his disposition, and
</p>
<p>of his turbulent conduct in after life. It is partly
</p>
<p>translated from the Italian of Mascardi, and was

<p>advantage of the public and of private persons ; and
</p>
<p>if the minds of the citizens had been as free from
</p>
<p>jealousy, as their fortunes were from necessity,
</p>
<p>that commonwealth had soon recovered from its
</p>
<p>past miseries, by a state of ease, wealth and hap-
</p>
<p>piness. But the want of union amongst them, and
</p>
<p>the seeds of hatred which the late divisions had left
</p>
<p>in the hearts of the people, were dangerous remains,
</p>
<p>which plainly indicated, that the great body was
</p>
<p>not yet cured of its distempers, and that its seeming
</p>
<p>health was like that of those persons, whose bloat-
</p>
<p>ed faces carry with them a good appearance, but
</p>
<p>conceal many ill humours. The nobility, who had
</p>
<p>the government in their hands, could not forget the
</p>
<p>injuries which they had received from the people,
</p>
<p>during the time that they had no share in the ma-
</p>
<p>nagement of affairs ; and the people, on their part,
</p>
<p>could not suffer the dominion of the nobility, but
</p>
<p>viewed it as a new tyranny, contrary to the or-
</p>
<p>dinances of the state. Some, even amongst the no-
</p>
<p>blemen, who aspired to a higher fortune, secretly
</p>
<p>envied the grandeur of the rest. Tims the one
</p>
<p>commanded with haughtiness, and the others obey-
</p>
<p>ed with indignation, and many thought themselves
</p>
<p>servants because they did not act enough like mas-
</p>
<p>ters ; when Providence permitted an accident to
</p>
<p>happen, which made these different sentiments break
</p>
<p>out on a sudden, and which finally confirmed the
</p>
<p>one in their command, and the others in their
</p>
<p>slavery. This was the conspiracy of John Lewis de
</p>
<p>J Fiesco, Count de Lavagna, which we must trace a
</p>
<p>little higher, the better to understand the circum-
</p>
<p>stances of the events that followed.

<p>At the time of those famous wars in which the
</p>
<p>Emperor Charles V. and Francis I. King of France,
</p>
<p>III. THE REVOLT OF COUNT FIESCO. 145
</p>
<p>laid Italy waste, Andrew Doria, born of one of
</p>
<p>the befit families in Genoa, and the greatest sea-
</p>
<p>man at that day in Europe, followed the French
</p>
<p>party with much zeal, and maintained the gran-
</p>
<p>deur and reputation of that crown at sea with
</p>
<p>such courage and good fortune, as tended no less
</p>
<p>to the advantage of those whose interests he pro-
</p>
<p>moted, than to his own glory. But it is a mis-
</p>
<p>fortune common to great princes not to regard suf-
</p>
<p>ficiently those who can do them service, wlien
</p>
<p>once they think themselves assured of their loyal-
</p>
<p>ty. From this cause proceeded the loss which
</p>
<p>France suffered of so good a servant ; and that loss
</p>
<p>produced effects so fatal, that the remembrance
</p>
<p>of them will ever be grievous and deplorable to
</p>
<p>that kingdom. Whilst this great man was engag-
</p>
<p>ed upon advantageous terms in the King's ser-
</p>
<p>vice abroad, as general of his galleys, those who
</p>
<p>were first in favour and power at home began to
</p>
<p>envy both his glory and his office, and formed the
</p>
<p>design of undoing the man whom they saw too
</p>
<p>great ever to submit to be a dependant on any one
</p>
<p>but his master. As they judged it at first nei-
</p>
<p>ther safe nor useful to their design to do him ill
</p>
<p>offices with the King, who had lately expressed
</p>
<p>too good an opinion of him, so soon to conceive
</p>
<p>an ill one ; they took a more subtile method, and,
</p>
<p>joining their praises to the public applause, which
</p>
<p>was given to Doria's first taking up arms for France,
</p>
<p>they resolved, by degrees, to give him such oc-
</p>
<p>casions of discontent, as might seem rather to
</p>
<p>proceed from the general necessity of affairs
</p>
<p>than from their private malice, and which, never-

</p>
<p>sought the means of giving his proud and haughty
</p>
<p>mind room to display itself, that they might the
</p>
<p>better ruin him in the King's good opinion ; and
</p>
<p>the business which his employment obliged him
</p>
<p>to have before the council, furnished those who
</p>
<p>were in full authority there with too many oc-
</p>
<p>casions of disobliging him. One time the ex-
</p>
<p>chequer was too low to pay his large salary ; an-
</p>
<p>other time it was assigned him upon insufficient
</p>
<p>funds ; sometimes his demands were reckoned un-
</p>
<p>just and exorbitant. At length, his remonstrances
</p>
<p>on the wrongs done him were so criminally re-
</p>
<p>presented to the King by the artifices of his ene-
</p>
<p>mies, that he began to be importunate and trouble-
</p>
<p>some, and, by little and little, came to be accounted
</p>
<p>by his Majesty a man of an interested, insolent,
</p>
<p>and turbulent spirit. He was at last openly dis-
</p>
<p>obliged, by being refused the ransom of the Prince
</p>
<p>of Orange, whom his nephew Philippino Doria had
</p>
<p>taken prisoner before Naples, and whom the King
</p>
<p>had caused to be put into other hands. They de-
</p>
<p>manded from him, even with threats, the Marquis
</p>
<p>de Guasto and Ascanio Colonna, taken prisoners at
</p>
<p>the same battle. They talked no longer of keep-
</p>
<p>ing the promise which they had made him, to
</p>
<p>restore Savona to the republic of Genoa : And
</p>
<p>as his enemies observed him to take fire, instead
</p>
<p>of concealing the reasons he had to complain,
</p>
<p>under an appearance of moderation, they left no-
</p>
<p>thing undone to increase them. Monsieur de
</p>
<p>Barbezieux was ordered to take possession of his
</p>
<p>galleys, and even to secure his person if it were
</p>
<p>possible. This fault was no less contrary to pru-

</p>
<p>France cannot be sufficiently blamed for having

</p>
<p>preferred their private interest to their master's
</p>
<p>service, and taken away from him the only man
</p>
<p>who could have maintained his party in Italy.
</p>
<p>And since they were resolved to ruin Doria, we
</p>
<p>may venture to say that they were bad politicians
</p>
<p>not to have done it thoroughly, but to have left
</p>
<p>him in a condition wherein lie was capable of
</p>
<p>doing a great deal of hurt, not only to France in
</p>
<p>general, but to themselves in particulai', by the
</p>
<p>vexation and disgust which the King might take
</p>
<p>at their counsels, and by the ill consequences
</p>
<p>which they had brought upon his kingdom.
</p>
<p>Doria, finding himself thus insultingly treated,
</p>
<p>published a manifesto of his complaints, protesting
</p>
<p>that they did not so much proceed from his private
</p>
<p>interests, as from the injustice with which Savona
</p>
<p>had been refused to be restored to his country,
</p>
<p>though so often promised by the French King. He
</p>
<p>treats with the Marquis de Guasto, his prisoner,
</p>
<p>declares for the Emperor, and accepts of the com-
</p>
<p>mand of his fleet. The conduct of this old politi-
</p>
<p>cian was in this, at least, as malicious as that of
</p>
<p>the French ministers, but much more cunning and
</p>
<p>judicious. He cannot be excused from an ex-
</p>
<p>treme ingi'atitude, in suffering hiraself to be hur-
</p>
<p>ried away by his passion to such a dangerous
</p>
<p>revenge against a prince, to whom he may be
</p>
<p>said to have been obliged for all his honour, since
</p>
<p>he iiad gained the most glorious marks of it in the
</p>
<p>command of his armies ; and he can hardly be ex-
</p>
<p>cused from a base piece of treachery, unworthy his
</p>
<p>former actions, in ordering his lieutenant, Philip-
</p>
<p>pino Doria, to suffer provisions to come into

</p>
<p>would continue in the King's service. But it
</p>
<p>must also be owned, that, for this way of acting
</p>
<p>he ought to pass for a very able man in rela-
</p>
<p>tion to political interest, for he so artfully threw
</p>
<p>the appearances on his side, that his friends could
</p>
<p>say that the breach of promise which he com-
</p>
<p>plained of for his country, was the true cause of
</p>
<p>his change ; and that his enemies could not deny but
</p>
<p>that he was compelled to it by such usage as was
</p>
<p>too severe and too hard to endure. Besides, he was
</p>
<p>not ignorant that the means of being greatly con-
</p>
<p>sidered in a party is, to let the first coming into
</p>
<p>it be accompanied with great advantages. And
</p>
<p>indeed, he contrived his revolt so well, and managed
</p>
<p>it with so much conduct, that he preserved Naples
</p>
<p>to the Emperor, which, in a few days, would
</p>
<p>have been taken from him by the French, if Phi-
</p>
<p>lippino Doria had continued faithful in their
</p>
<p>service. By this change France lost one of the
</p>
<p>greatest generals that ever the kingdom produced, *
</p>
<p>and at last placed the commonwealth of Genoa
</p>
<p>under the protection of the crown of Spain, to
</p>
<p>whom it is advantageous on account of its con-
</p>
<p>tiguity to the Spanish dominions in Italy. This
</p>
<p>was the first of Andrew Doria's actions for the
</p>
<p>Emperor's service, after he had openly declared
</p>
<p>himself against the French King.
</p>
<p>This skilful and ambitious man, acquainted as
</p>
<p>he was with the intrigues of Genoa and the in-
</p>
<p>clinations of the Genoese, did not fail to manage

<p>the minds of that people, who have always been

<p>accused of a natural love for novelty. As he had

<p>in the city many friends and secret favourers, who
</p>
<p>took care to v^ive liim intellic^ence of all that pass-
</p>
<p>ed there, he took care, on his side, to confirm the
</p>
<p>one in the discontent which they expressed against
</p>
<p>tlie present government, and to use his endea-
</p>
<p>vours to raise a like discontent in the others ; 
</p>
<p>to persuade the people that the French left them
</p>
<p>only the name of sovereigns, whilst they them-
</p>
<p>selves kept all the power ;  to set before the no-
</p>
<p>bility the image of the ancient government which
</p>
<p>had always been in their hands ;  and, lastly, to
</p>
<p>inspire every one with the hopes of a general re-
</p>
<p>establishment of affairs, by a revolution.
</p>
<p>Having formed his party, he came near to Ge-
</p>
<p>noa with his galleys, landed his troops, and ranged
</p>
<p>them in order of battle, without meeting with any
</p>
<p>resistance. He entered the city, followed by those
</p>
<p>of his friends who had taken up arms at the ap-
</p>
<p>pointed signal. He possessed himself of the prin-
</p>
<p>cipal posts, of which he made himself master, al-
</p>
<p>most without drawing his sword. Theodore Tri-
</p>
<p>vulcius, who commanded there for the King of
</p>
<p>France, lost with Genoa all the reputation which
</p>
<p>he had gained in the Italian wai's, by neglecting to
</p>
<p>frustrate the measures which were concerted there,
</p>
<p>though he had notice given him of them ; and be-
</p>
<p>cause, to save his life and his money, he preferred
</p>
<p>the making a shameful composition in the Castle,
</p>
<p>to the burying himself honourably in the ruins of
</p>
<p>that place which was of such importance to his
</p>
<p>master's service.

<p>tiona, following their trae sentiments ; the other,
</p>
<p>by their dissembled shouts, endeavouring to con-
</p>
<p>ceal the opinion which they had expressed on di-
</p>
<p>vers occasions, that their thoughts were not agree-
</p>
<p>able to the public joy ; and the greatest part re-
</p>
<p>joiced at these things (as it is common with the vul-
</p>
<p>gar), for no other reason than because they were
</p>
<p>new.
</p>
<p>Doria did not suffer this zeal to subside. He
</p>
<p>assembled the nobility, he put the government into
</p>
<p>their hands, and, protesting that he claimed no
</p>
<p>share in it but what should be common to him
</p>
<p>and the rest of the noblemen, he gave a form to
</p>
<p>the commonwealth ; and having received all ima-
</p>
<p>ginable testimonies of the obligations which his
</p>
<p>fellow-citizens had to him, he retired to his palace
</p>
<p>to enjoy at ease the fruits of his past labours ; and
</p>
<p>the commonwealth erected a statue for him, with
</p>
<p>the title of father of his country, and
</p>
<p>RESTORER OF LIBERTY.
</p>
<p>Many people are of opinion, that Doria had
</p>
<p>fully satisfied his ambition in thus restoring liberty
</p>
<p>to his country, and that the general applause which
</p>
<p>he received from his countrymen, rather inspired
</p>
<p>him with the thought of enjoying that glory in
</p>
<p>quiet, than that of making use of it for higher
</p>
<p>purposes. Others cannot imagine, that the great
</p>
<p>employment which he had recently accepted in
</p>
<p>the Emperor's service, and the continual care he
</p>
<p>had taken to keep the nobility of Genoa attached
</p>
<p>to his house, could proceed from a quiet and en-
</p>
<p>tirely disinterested mind. They think that he was
</p>
<p>too able a man, not to see that a sovereign in Ge-

</p>
<p>His old age might, however, have justly dimi-
</p>
<p>nished the fear they had of his authority, if they
</p>
<p>liad not perceived a power almost equal to his own
</p>
<p>lodged in a second self. * Giannetino Doria, his cou-
</p>
<p>sin and adopted son, aged about twenty-eight, was
</p>
<p>extremely vain, haughty, and insolent ; he had the
</p>
<p>survivorship of all his father's posts, and by that
</p>
<p>means kept the Genoese nobility in his interest.
</p>
<p>He lived with too much splendour for a citizen
</p>
<p>who desired to avoid drawing envy on himself,
</p>
<p>and giving offence to the commonwealth ; and
</p>
<p>he even showed pretty openly that he disdained
</p>
<p>that character. The extraordinary height to which
</p>
<p>that House had attained, produced the great agi-
</p>
<p>tation of which we are now about to speak, and
</p>
<p>may serve as a memorable example to all states,
</p>
<p>never to suffer within themselves any person so
</p>
<p>eminent, that his authority may give rise to the
</p>
<p>design of bringing him down, and to the pretence

<p>assured himself that his merit would have opened

<p>him a way to that glory he so passionately desired
</p>
<p>in secret, by serving his country, if the extraor-
</p>
<p>dinary power of Giannetino Doria, whom we have
</p>
<p>just now mentioned, had left him any room to
</p>
<p>hope for an employment. 'But as he was too
</p>
<p>great by his birth, and too much esteemed for his

<p>good qualities, not to excite an apprehension in the
</p>
<p>man who would have had all the reputation and
</p>
<p>strength of the commonwealth to centre in him-
</p>
<p>self, he foresaw that he could have little chance of
</p>
<p>success in a place where his rival was almost en-

</p>
<p>in the highest posts who take umbrage at others,
</p>
<p>never think of those who ai'e the occasion of it but
</p>
<p>with a design of ruining them. Seeing, therefore,
</p>
<p>that he had every thing to fear from Doria's gran-
</p>
<p>deur, and nothing to hope for his own advantage,
</p>
<p>he thought himself obliged to prevent, by his in-
</p>
<p>genuity and courage, the ill consequences of that
</p>
<p>greatness which was so opposite to that of his own

<p>tinual endeavour to keep down those who have any

<p>merit, and who are capable of raising themselves.

<p>All these considerations made John Lewis de

</p>
<p>family, he resolved, witli tlieir ruin, to effect a
</p>
<p>chan^''e in that government.
</p>
<p>Great rivers never do any harm whilst nothing
</p>
<p>witlistands their course : but tlie least obstacle
</p>
<p>makes them rush forward with vioUnce, and a
</p>
<p>small dam is often the occasion of their drowning
</p>
<p>those plains which they would otherwise have
</p>
<p>watered with advantage. Thus we may judge,
</p>
<p>that if the Count de Fiesco had not found his path
</p>
<p>to glory blocked up by the authority of the Dorias,
</p>
<p>he had certainly kept within the bounds of a more
</p>
<p>moderate conduct, and had usefully employed, for
</p>
<p>the service of his country, those talents which
</p>
<p>brought it to the brink of ruin.
</p>
<p>These ambitious thoughts were kept up in the
</p>
<p>Count's mind by many persons who hoped to find
</p>
<p>their private advantage in the public confusion ;
</p>
<p>and amongst these, none were more eager in their
</p>
<p>solicitations than the French, who made him great
</p>
<p>promises and considerable offers ; first by Caesar
</p>
<p>Fregozo and Cagnino Gonzaga, and afterwards
</p>
<p>by Monsieur du Bellay, who had private con-
</p>
<p>ferences with him by means of Peter Luke de
</p>
<p>Fiesco.
</p>
<p>It was the common opinion of that time, that
</p>
<p>Pope Paul, hoping by the same blow, to ruin
</p>
<p>Andrew Doria, whom he hated for some private
</p>
<p>reasans, and to take away from the Emperor,
</p>
<p>who was already too powerful, a considerable
</p>
<p>support of his party in Italy, had left nothing
</p>
<p>undone to feed the Count de Flesco's ambition,
</p>
<p>and had raised in him the strongest desire of form-
</p>
<p>ing a design upon Genoa.

</p>
<p>resolutions, as to see himself courted by persons
</p>
<p>eminent either by their dignity or tlieir reputation.
</p>
<p>This mark of their esteem immediately fills him
</p>
<p>with a great confidence in his own merit, and
</p>
<p>makes him think himself capable of succeeding in
</p>
<p>the greatest affairs. The design which the Count
</p>
<p>had formed must for this reason have appeared
</p>
<p>both glorious and easy to him, since he saw him-
</p>
<p>self urged to it by the greatest prince in Europe,
</p>
<p>and by the most able man of his time. The one
</p>
<p>was Francis I., who ordered Peter Strozzi, 
</p>
<p>who was to pass with some troops over the moun-
</p>
<p>tains near Genoa, to press (in his majesty's name)
</p>
<p>the execution of it ; and the other was Cardi-
</p>
<p>nal Augustine Trivulcius, ambassador of France
</p>
<p>at the Court of Rome, from whom the Count re-
</p>
<p>ceived all imaginable honours, in the journey which
</p>
<p>he took to that city, under pretence of diversion,
</p>
<p>but in reality the better to communicate his design
</p>
<p>to the Pope, and to learn his sentiments.
</p>
<p>That Cardinal, who was in great repute, and
</p>
<p>who was thought to have much penetration in
</p>
<p>state affairs, found means to animate the Count,
</p>
<p>by exciting in him an emulation to which he was
</p>
<p>but too subject, in setting before his eyes, with all
</p>
<p>the arts that could rouse his jealousy, the present,
</p>
<p>greatness of Giannetino Doria,and the future gieat-
</p>
<p>ness of which he began to assure himself by the
</p>
<p>deep root which his authority began to take ; and
</p>
<p>thus increasing his envy of the one and his fear
</p>
<p>of the other, he represented to him how unsup-
</p>
<p>portable it is for a man of spirit to live in a com-
</p>

<p>raising himself, and where merit and noble birth
</p>
<p>make hardly any distinction betwixt the most il-
</p>
<p>lustrious and the most common persons.
</p>
<p>Having thoroughly confirmed Fiesco in his general
</p>
<p>design, the Cardinal came to particulars, by offering
</p>
<p>him all possible assistance on the part of France ;
</p>
<p>and he so strongly pressed the Count, whose mind
</p>
<p>was already inclined to that side, that at last he
</p>
<p>seemed to accept with the utmost joy the pro-
</p>
<p>posal that was made to him, of giving him the pay
</p>
<p>and the command of six galleys for the King's ser-
</p>
<p>vice, a garrison of two hundred men in Montobio,
</p>
<p>a company of gens d'armes, and a pension of
</p>
<p>twelve thousand crowns ; desiring time, however,
</p>
<p>till his return to Genoa, before he gave his final
</p>
<p>answer. So true it is, that nothing is more diffi-
</p>
<p>cult in affairs of importance, than to take at once
</p>
<p>an ultimate resolution, because the numerous con-
</p>
<p>siderations which crowd into the mind, and de-
</p>
<p>stroy each other, make people think that they
</p>
<p>never have sufficiently deliberated.
</p>
<p>Extraordinary actions may be resembled to
</p>
<p>thunder, which never produces any violent claps
</p>
<p>or dangerous effects, but when the exhalations
</p>
<p>of which it is formed have been long struggling
</p>
<p>against each other ; otherwise, it is only a mass of
</p>
<p>vapours which yield nothing but a dull sound,
</p>
<p>which, far from giving us fear, is scarcely to be
</p>
<p>heard. The same thing may be said of resolu-
</p>
<p>tions in great affairs, when they enter sudden-
</p>
<p>ly into any one's mind, and are received there
</p>
<p>with a very weak resistance. This is an infalli-
</p>
<p>able sign that they make but slight and transient

<p>impressions ; which, though these may excite some
</p>
<p>156 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>trouble, can never be strong enough to produce
</p>
<p>any considerable effect.
</p>
<p>It cannot be reasonably doubted, that John
</p>
<p>Lewis de Fiesco did not consider maturely, and
</p>
<p>with great reflection, what he intended to under-
</p>
<p>take ; for on his return to Genoa, though he had a
</p>
<p>violent desire to execute his design, he neverthe-
</p>
<p>less deliberated a considerable time, about the seve-
</p>
<p>ral means which might conduce to the end which
</p>
<p>he had proposed to himself. Sometimes the aid
</p>
<p>of a great king made him incline to throw himself
</p>
<p>into the hands of the French ; sometimes the na-
</p>
<p>tural distrust which men are apt to have of foreign-
</p>
<p>ers, joined to a certain desire for glory which makes
</p>
<p>them passionately wish to owe their great actions
</p>
<p>to none but themselves, inclined him to seek in
</p>
<p>his own strength for means which might bear some
</p>
<p>proportion to his elevated thoughts ; and perhaps
</p>
<p>these different agitations had kept his mind longer
</p>
<p>in suspense, and produced a farther delay, if he
</p>
<p>had not, at every moment, had some fresh cause
</p>
<p>of just indignation against the excessive pride of
</p>
<p>Giannetino Doria, who, carrying his insolence to the
</p>
<p>pitch of despising every one, treated the Count
</p>
<p>after his return with such haughtiness, that he
</p>
<p>could no longer conceal his exasperation, and his
</p>
<p>detestation of the simmeful slavery of all his fellow-
</p>
<p>citizens.
</p>
<p>Politicians have blamed this conduct as injudici-
</p>
<p>ous, following in this the general rule of never
</p>
<p>showing the least sign of anger against those we
</p>
<p>hate, but at the moment we strike that blow
</p>
<p>which is to bring them down. But if he wanted

<p>prudence on this occasion, it must be owned tliat
</p>
<p>It is a fault common to persons of great courage,

</p>
<p>wliom contempt exasperates too much to give them
</p>
<p>time to consult their reason and master themselves.
</p>
<p>This fault, however, has freed him from the impu-
</p>
<p>tation cast on him by some Iiistorians, that he was
</p>
<p>one of a dark and dissembling temper, that lie was
</p>
<p>more covetous than ambitious, and more in love
</p>
<p>with interest than glory. This warmth, I say,
</p>
<p>which has been observed in his conduct, shows
</p>
<p>that he was urged to this enterprise by no o-
</p>
<p>tlier motives than an emulation of honour and a
</p>
<p>generous ambition ; since all those who have en-
</p>
<p>gaged in the like designs out of a spirit of tyran-
</p>
<p>ny, and for other interests than those which tend
</p>
<p>to a great reputation, have always begun by the
</p>
<p>most submissive patience and abject cringings.
</p>
<p>It is certain that the insolence of GiannetinoDoria
</p>
<p>was carried to an insufferable excess, and that he
</p>
<p>followed in every particular the wicked maxim,
</p>
<p>that severity and haughtiness are the most secure
</p>
<p>methods of reigning, and tliat it is useless to govern
</p>
<p>with lenity those who may be kept within the
</p>
<p>bounds of their duty by their fear and their inter-
</p>
<p>est. Tfiis conduct so increased the aversion which
</p>
<p>the Count had against him, that it hastened the
</p>
<p>resolution which he had taken of undoing him, and
</p>
<p>gave him an opportunity of making a good use
</p>
<p>against him of that pride witli which Giannetino
</p>
<p>pretended to keep every body under.
</p>
<p>Cardinal Augustine Trivnlcius, who knew that
</p>
<p>on those occasions the minds of young men must
</p>
<p>not be suffered to cool, sent to him, imme-
</p>
<p>diately after his return to Genoa, Nicholas Fo-

</p>
<p>That gentleman having found him more exasper-
</p>
<p>ated than ever, and in the condition which we
</p>
<p>have represented, got him to sign whatever he
</p>
<p>pleased, and immediately returned to get the
</p>
<p>treaty ratified by the French king's ministers who
</p>
<p>were then at Rome. But before he had gone
</p>
<p>thirty or forty leagues he was recalled in great
</p>
<p>haste, the Count having reflected, that he had act-
</p>
<p>ed too precipitately, and that he ought not to
</p>
<p>conclude an affair of that consequence without
</p>
<p>consulting some of his friends, with whose ca-
</p>
<p>pacity he was acquainted. He sent for three of
</p>
<p>them, on whose fidelity he could rely, and whom
</p>
<p>he very much esteemed for their good qualities ;
</p>
<p>and having, in general, declared to them the resolu-
</p>
<p>tions he had taken no longer to bear with the pre-
</p>
<p>sent government of the commonwealth, he beg-
</p>
<p>ged of them to declare their opinion on this sub--
</p>
<p>ject.
</p>
<p>Vincent Calcagno of Varesa, a zealous servant
</p>
<p>of the House of Fiesco, and a man of judgment
</p>
<p>but of a timorous spirit, began his discourse with
</p>
<p>the liberty to which his long services entitled him,
</p>
<p>and addressing himself to the Count, he spoke in
</p>
<p>this manner.

<p>" I think those who have the misfortune to be
</p>
<p>engaged in great affairs, are very justly to be pitied,
</p>
<p>because they are, as it were, on a troubled sea,
</p>
<p>where they can see no place but what is distin-
</p>
<p>guished by some shipwreck. But it is just that
</p>
<p>we should redouble our fears, when we see young
</p>
<p>men whom we love exposed to this danger ;

</p>
<p>safely into the harbour. All your servants ought to
</p>
<p>be sensibly concerned at the enterprises to which
</p>
<p>your courage prompts you. Give me leave to
</p>
<p>tell you, that they are above your age, and the
</p>
<p>state in which you are. You dream of projects
</p>
<p>which require such a regard in the world, that the
</p>
<p>reputation of a man of your age, however great it
</p>
<p>may be, can never attain to it ; and you form a
</p>
<p>design which requires such forces, as one of the
</p>
<p>greatest kings on earth has never yet been able to
</p>
<p>set on foot. These thoughts arise in your mind
</p>
<p>from two errors, which are in some measure inhe-
</p>
<p>rent to human nature. Men are apt to have too
</p>
<p>great thoughts of themselves, that is, they act as
</p>
<p>if whatever their imagination tells them they can
</p>
<p>do were actually within their power ; and they
</p>
<p>judge with little certainty of other persons, be-
</p>
<p>cause they judge of them only with regard to
</p>
<p>themselves, and consider what service those per-
</p>
<p>sons are able to do them, and not what they ought
</p>
<p>to do, or are likely to do for their own interest.
</p>
<p>The first of these is extremely dangerous, because
</p>
<p>as no one executes a great enterprise alone, but is
</p>
<p>obliged to communicate it to many people, it is of
</p>
<p>the highest importance that they should believe it
</p>
<p>reasonable and practicable, or otherwise the under-
</p>
<p>taker will meet but with few friends who are ready
</p>
<p>to follow his fortune. The second is more com-
</p>
<p>mon, and no less dangerous ; because it often hap-
</p>
<p>pens that we find the greatest resistance from
</p>
<p>those very persons of whose assistance we had the
</p>
<p>greatest expectation. Be careful, therefore, that

<p>you, and which you, perhaps justly, imagine may
</p>
<p>supply your want of experience, do not lead you
</p>
<p>160 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>into the first inconveniency ; and consider, that
</p>
<p>how shilling soever those qualities may he, it is
</p>
<p>hard to imagine that they will procure you, even
</p>
<p>with those who have the best dispositions for that
</p>
<p>service, such a share of esteem, as is proportionate
</p>
<p>to the execution of so difficult and dangerous an
</p>
<p>undertaking. Consider, besides, that it is not cre-
</p>
<p>dible that these qualities should so dazzle your
</p>
<p>enemies, as to prevent their making a proper use
</p>
<p>against yourself of the pretence of your youth.
</p>
<p>Take care that the greatness of your birth, and
</p>
<p>the reputation which your good qualities have
</p>
<p>acquired you, the abundance of your riches, and
</p>
<p>the secret intelligence which perhaps you have
</p>
<p>secured, do not lead you into the second incon-
</p>
<p>veniency, and make you believe that tlie assist-
</p>
<p>ance of those who have promised you, cannot fail
</p>
<p>you, when you have need of it. Change, there-
</p>
<p>fore, that thought, or if you still preserve it, cease
</p>
<p>to consider others with respect to yourself, but
</p>
<p>consider them with respect to themselves ; exa-
</p>
<p>mine their interest, and think, that that is the
</p>
<p>most powerful motive of men's actions ; that most
</p>
<p>of those who esteem and love you, love themselves
</p>
<p>infinitely better, and fear their own ruin much more
</p>
<p>than they wish your greatness. In short, con-
</p>
<p>sider that those who give you hopes of their assist-
</p>
<p>ance are either foreigners, or your own countrymen.
</p>
<p>The most considerable amongst the first are the
</p>
<p>French, who cannot undertake to assist you, be-
</p>
<p>cause they are employed in defending their own
</p>
<p>country against the armies of the empire and of

<p>pany aft'airs of this nature ; and interest will make
</p>
<p>the rest afraid of hazarding tlioir quiet and their
</p>
<p>fortunes. The most part of those that are not in-
</p>
<p>fluenced by these considerations are persons of so
</p>
<p>mean a birth, and so little power, that nothing for
</p>
<p>your advantage is to be hoped for from them. So
</p>
<p>that Doria's too great power, and the bad state of the
</p>
<p>times, which give you tliese thoughts of rebellion,
</p>
<p>ought to inspire you with patience, since they have
</p>
<p>so depressed the minds of the Genoese, that they
</p>
<p>now make a glory of submitting out of gratitude
</p>
<p>to the authority of Andrew Doria, that liberty
</p>
<p>which he has restored to them, and which he
</p>
<p>snatched out of the hands of foreigners, for no
</p>
<p>other end but to usurp the dominion over them.
</p>
<p>Do you not perceive that this commonwealth has
</p>
<p>for a long time had only the image of a free go-
</p>
<p>vernment, and that it can no longer subsist with-
</p>
<p>out a master ? Do you not see that the greatest
</p>
<p>part of the nobility are attached to the interest of
</p>
<p>the House of Doria, by the employments at sea
</p>
<p>wliich that House bestows on them ; and that this
</p>
<p>family, under the protection of the Empire and of
</p>
<p>Spain, liolds all else in fear ? Do you not per-
</p>
<p>ceive, I say, that all the Genoese are buried in a
</p>
<p>kind of lethargy, and that the bravest do not
</p>
<p>think it dishonourable to yield to that mighty
</p>
<p>power, provided they do not adore it ? I do not
</p>
<p>here pretend to justify the imprudence of the com-
</p>
<p>monwealth, who have suffered the elevation of

<p>raised, reaches the top without stumhling, he must,
</p>
<p>in the heginnin^, have met witli many ditiiculties,
</p>
<p>which have by little and little accustomed him to
</p>
<p>stand firm in so slippery a place. Caesar had, in
</p>
<p>the liighest degree, all qualities necessary to a
</p>
<p>great prince, and yet it is certain, that neither his
</p>
<p>courtesy, his prudence, his courage, his eloquence,
</p>
<p>nor his liberality, had ever raised him to the em-
</p>
<p>pire of the world, had he not found great difficul-
</p>
<p>ties to overcome in the commonwealth of Rome.
</p>
<p>The pretence which the persecution of Pompey
</p>
<p>furnished him with,  the reputation which their
</p>
<p>contests gave him room to acquire,  the advantage
</p>
<p>he made by the divisions of his fellow-citizens,
</p>
<p>were the true causes of his power ; and, notwith-
</p>
<p>standing this, you seem desirous of adding to the
</p>
<p>establishment of the family of Doria the only ad-
</p>
<p>vantage whicli was wanting to it ; and because
</p>
<p>their happiness has hitherto cost them too little to
</p>
<p>be well assured, you seem desirous of settling it
</p>
<p>on a firm foundation, by endeavours which, being
</p>
<p>too weak to destroy it, will only serve to justify
</p>
<p>their undertakings, and establish their authority.
</p>
<p>But for once I will give into your way of thinking,
</p>
<p>and suppose that you have happily executed your
</p>
<p>designs ;  imagine, then, the family of the Dorias
</p>
<p>massacred, all the nobility who follow their inte-
</p>
<p>rest in fetters ; imagine all your enemies over-

<p>thrown, Spain and the Empire in a condition not

<p>the midst of a desolate city, which will look on you

</p>
<p>rather as a new tyrant, than as a deliverer ? What
</p>
<p>solid foundations will you find on which to build
</p>
<p>your new greatness ? Can you put any trust in the
</p>
<p>humour of the people, who, the very moment that
</p>
<p>they have placed the crown on your head, if you
</p>
<p>have any such thought, will perhaps conceive the
</p>
<p>greatest horror against you, and will think of no-
</p>
<p>thing but the means of taking it otf again ? For,
</p>
<p>as I have already told you, they can neither enjoy
</p>
<p>their liberty, nor bear long with the same master.
</p>
<p>Or, if you put Genoa once again into the posses-
</p>
<p>sion of foreigners, if by your means the city opens
</p>
<p>its gates to them, the first time they are ill used
</p>
<p>by them, you will be considered as the destroyer
</p>
<p>of your country, and the parricide of the people.
</p>
<p>Are you not afraid that those who now are the
</p>
<p>keenest to serve you, may be the first to work your
</p>
<p>ruin, by their envy at being subjected to you ?
</p>
<p>And even supposing that that consideration should
</p>
<p>not induce them to it, you cannot be ignorant that
</p>
<p>those who serve a rebel, imagine they so strongly
</p>
<p>oblige him, that no reward being sufficient to sa-
</p>
<p>tisfy them, they most commonly become his ene-

<p>mies. As those who roll down a mountain are
</p>
<p>dashed to pieces against those very points of rocks
</p>
<p>which they made use of to get up to the top ; so
</p>
<p>those that fall from an exalted fortune, are almost
</p>
<p>always ruined by the means which they had em-
</p>
<p>ployed for their elevation. T am sensible that am-
</p>
<p>bition continually tickles persons of your rank,
</p>
<p>age, and merit, and that it represents nothing to
</p>
<p>your eyes but pompous and splendid images of
</p>
<p>glory and grandeur. But whilst your imagination

<p>ought to make you behold it as the passion which
</p>
<p>generally makes them unhappy, and obliges them
</p>
<p>to quit the most certain advantages for the most
</p>
<p>uncertain hopes. Consider, that if its just use is
</p>
<p>the occasion of the greatest virtues, its abuse oc-
</p>
<p>casions the greatest crimes. Imagine that it is
</p>
<p>that passion wiiich of old mingled so many poi-
</p>
<p>sons, and sharpened so many poniards against
</p>
<p>usurpers and tyrants, and that it is that same pas-
</p>
<p>sion that now urges you on to be the Catiline of
</p>
<p>Genoa. Flatter not yourself that the design you
</p>
<p>seem to have to preserve the liberty of the com-
</p>
<p>monwealth, can be otherwise received in the world
</p>
<p>than as the common pretence of all factious peo-
</p>
<p>ple. And supposing that, in reality, no other mo-
</p>
<p>tive but your zeal for the public good should in-
</p>
<p>duce you to this attempt, you must not hope that
</p>
<p>any one will do you the justice to believe it ; since,
</p>
<p>in all actions which may indifferently be attributed
</p>
<p>to virtue or vice, when nothing but the intention
</p>
<p>of the doer can justify them, men, who can judge
</p>
<p>only from appearances, seldom make a favourable
</p>
<p>construction of the most innocent ones. But, in
</p>
<p>the present enterprise, which way soever you turn
</p>
<p>your eyes, it is impossible to behold any thing but
</p>
<p>massacres, plunder, and such dismal objects as the
</p>
<p>best intentions in the world cannot justify. Learn,
</p>
<p>therefore, to regulate your ambition ; and remem-
</p>
<p>ber, that the only instance wherein that passion
</p>
<p>can be justified, is, where you set aside your own
</p>
<p>interest, and follow only the rules of your duty.

<p>greatest human happiness and misery, on ])leasure

<p>and pain, on life and death ; and yet it is this love
</p>
<p>of true glory, this elevated state of the mind, which
</p>
<p>renders men truly great, and raises them above
</p>
<p>the rest of the world. This is the only glory that
</p>
<p>can render you perfectly happy (even though the
</p>
<p>dangers which you imagine to yourself surrounded
</p>
<p>you on all hands), since you cannot acquire any
</p>
<p>other without disgracing yourself by the greatest
</p>

<p>The Count was extremely moved with this dis-
</p>
<p>course, because it seemed grounded on solid rea-
</p>
<p>sons, and because the confidence he had reposed
</p>
<p>in the speaker, from his earliest youth, added
</p>
<p>to its authority. Verrina, who was one of those
</p>
<p>who were called to this council, a man of an ex-
</p>
<p>tensive genius, impetuous, naturally inclined to
</p>
<p>great enterprises, an implacable enemy to the pre-
</p>
<p>sent government, almost ruined by his great ex-
</p>
<p>penses, firmly attached to the Count both by in-

<p>terest and inclination, answered what had been

<p>said in the following manner :

<p>in Genoa, capable of the sentiments you have just

<p>now heard, were not my wonder lost in the con-

<p>When every body bears oppression with so abject

<p>symptom that gave the plainest proof of the vio-
</p>
<p>lence of our distemper. But it seems to me very
</p>
<p>unreasonable not to reap some advantage from the
</p>
<p>knowledge we have of our disease, since nature
</p>
<p>itself instructs us that we are obliged to make
</p>
<p>use of that knowledge for the application of the
</p>
<p>necessary remedies. The condition, however, of
</p>
<p>this commonwealth is not yet so desperate, that
</p>
<p>all its members are corrupted ; and the Count de
</p>
<p>Fiesco, whom fortune has raised above the rest
</p>
<p>of his countrymen, in greatness, riches, and birth,
</p>
<p>carries his thoughts to those heights which the
</p>
<p>narrow views of the Genoese cannot reach, and
</p>
<p>rises by his courage above the general corrup-
</p>
<p>tion. To examine whether a man be born for ex-
</p>
<p>traordinary actions, it is not sufficient to consider
</p>
<p>him with regard to the advantages of nature
</p>
<p>and fortune, (since there have been many persons
</p>
<p>possessed of both these advantages, who have,
</p>
<p>notwithstanding, continued all their days to go
</p>
<p>on in the common path of life) ; but we must
</p>
<p>observe if a man of quality, when he finds himself
</p>
<p>in unhappy circumstances, and in a country where
</p>
<p>tyranny begins to take place, preserves still the
</p>
<p>principles of virtue, and the good qualities which
</p>
<p>nature has bestowed on him. For if he does not
</p>
<p>lose them on these occasions, but resists the con-
</p>
<p>tagion of those base maxims which infect the rest
</p>
<p>of the world, and particularly the minds of great
</p>
<p>people (because tyrants take the greatest pains to
</p>
<p>corrupt them, as those of whom they are most afraid,)
</p>
<p>we may then judge, that such a person's reputa-

<p>tion will one day equal his merit, and that fortune

<p>any one from whom the commonwealth could just-
</p>
<p>ly expect such great things as from yourself. You
</p>
<p>come into the world in times, which afford you
</p>
<p>hardly any example of courage and generosity hut
</p>
<p>what has been punished, and which present you
</p>
<p>every day with instances of baseness and coward-
</p>
<p>ice which have been rewarded. Add to this, that
</p>
<p>you are in a country where the power of the house
</p>
<p>of Doria keeps the hearts of the nobility oppressed
</p>
<p>with the most shameful fear, or engaged by the
</p>
<p>most sordid interest, and yet you are not infected
</p>
<p>with this general contagion. You maintain the
</p>
<p>noble sentiments with which your illustrious birth
</p>
<p>has inspired you, and your mind forms enter-
</p>
<p>prises worthy of your valour. Do not, therefore,
</p>
<p>neglect these admirable qualities ; do not slight the
</p>
<p>gifts of nature ; serve your country; judge by the
</p>
<p>excellence of your inclinations of the great ac-
</p>
<p>tions they may produce; consider that there is alone
</p>
<p>wanting a man of your condition and merit to
</p>
<p>restore the spirit of the Genoese, and inflame them
</p>
<p>with their first love of liberty. Persuade yourself
</p>
<p>that tyranny is the greatest evil that can befal a
</p>
<p>commonwealth. The condition in which ours is
</p>
<p>now, is of the nature of those distempers, which,

<p>the Count de Fiesco for havinj^ suffered it. The
</p>
<p>great esteem your good qualities liare acquired
</p>
<p>you, has already done half the work. Let none
</p>
<p>speak of your youth as an obstacle to the success
</p>
<p>of 80 glorious a design ;* yours is an age where
</p>
<p>the heat of your blood, and the noble impulse of
</p>
<p>your courage, can inspire you with nothing but
</p>
<p>great designs ; and in extraordinary actions, we
</p>
<p>have always more need of vigour and boldness,
</p>
<p>than of the cold reflections of a timorous prudence,
</p>
<p>wliich shows us all the inconveniences we have to
</p>
<p>fear. Besides, your reputation is so well esta-
</p>
<p>blished, that I may say without flattery, that with
</p>
<p>all the charms by which youth naturally acquires
</p>
<p>friends, you have gained that credit in the world
</p>
<p>which is seldom obtained but in a more advanced
</p>
<p>age. Wherefore you are under a happy obligation
</p>
<p>to keep up the idea which the world has con-
</p>
<p>ceived of your virtue. Knowing your perfect dis-
</p>
<p>interestedness, I know not whether I ought to add
</p>
<p>to the considerations of the misery of our com-
</p>
<p>monwealth, some motives which respect you in
</p>
<p>particular; but since there are some occasions
</p>
<p>where interest is so closely linked with honour,
</p>
<p>that it is almost as shameful not to regard it, as it
</p>
<p>is sometimes glorious to despise it. I beg you to
</p>
<p>cast your eyes on the condition in which you will
</p>
<p>be placed, if the present government lasts much
</p>
<p>longer. Those who join an uncommon merit to
</p>
<p>an illustrious birth, have always two powerful ene-

<p>those who are in the most considerable posts. It

<p>who have a great (]eal of courage, and are much
</p>
<p>considered in tlie world, to escape the last. Pru-
</p>
<p>dence and good manners may indeed diminish that
</p>
<p>jealousy to which interest gives rise amongst equals,
</p>
<p>hut they can never entirely remove from the minds
</p>
<p>of superiors the umbrage occasioned by the care
</p>
<p>they take of their safety. There are some virtues
</p>
<p>80 beautiful, that they force even envy itself to do
</p>
<p>them homage. But whilst they are gaining a vic-
</p>
<p>tory over tiiis passion, they are increasing the
</p>
<p>strength of the other passion which I have men-
</p>
<p>tioned. Hatred grows greater as merit rises, and
</p>
<p>virtue, under these circumstances, may be com-
</p>
<p>pared to a ship in a storm, which has no sooner
</p>
<p>overcome the fury of one wave, than it is attacked
</p>
<p>by another more violent than the first. Can you
</p>
<p>be ignorant that Giannetino Doriais gnawed with a
</p>
<p>secret envy at your birth, which is by far supe-
</p>
<p>rior to his ? At your riches, more honestly ac-
</p>
<p>quired than those he possesses ? And at your re-
</p>
<p>putation, which far surpasses any that he can ever
</p>
<p>pretend to ? Wliat reason have you to believe
</p>
<p>that envy, raised by these considerations, and ani-
</p>
<p>mated by a violent ambition, will produce nothing
</p>
<p>in the mind of that insolent man, but weak and
</p>
<p>imperfect thoughts, and that it will not tend di-
</p>
<p>rectly to your ruin ? Have you any ground to
</p>
<p>hope, that if, by your prudence and the force of
</p>
<p>your virtue, you had overcome this envy, you
</p>
<p>could avoid that hatred with which the difference

<p>of your humours inspires him against you ; and

</p>
<p>quences of it are inevitable, because you cannot
</p>
<p>throw off those qualities which will draw his hatred
</p>
<p>upon you, nor divest yourself of your nature, and
</p>
<p>cease to be generous. But supposing it were iu
</p>
<p>your power to conceal, under a modest appearance,
</p>
<p>that greatness of soul which raises you so much
</p>
<p>above the vulgar, can you imagine that Giannetino
</p>
<p>Doria, suspicious as he is, like all his fellow ty-
</p>
<p>rants, would not be in continual distrust of your
</p>
<p>conduct ? All the marks of your moderation and
</p>
<p>patience would seem to him artifices and snares
</p>
<p>to undo him. He could not imagine that one
</p>
<p>of the name of Fiesco could be capable of so
</p>
<p>much meanness ; and, judging with reason of what
</p>
<p>you would be, from wliat you ought to be, he
</p>
<p>would make use, for your ruin, of that appear-
</p>
<p>ance of submission which you would assume,
</p>
<p>before him, for your safety. All the difference,
</p>
<p>therefore, betwixt your present condition, and
</p>
<p>that in which you might then expect to be placed,
</p>
<p>would be, that you would then be certainly
</p>
<p>assured of perishing with infamy ; whereas, by
</p>
<p>following the generous sentiments which your
</p>
<p>inclination prompts, you are assured that the
</p>
<p>only misfortune which can befall you is to die
</p>
<p>in a glorious enterprise, and to gain, by your
</p>
<p>death, as great a share of honour as ever fell to
</p>
<p>the lot of any private man. If you see these
</p>
<p>things, as doubtless you may see them clearer than
</p>
<p>I, it is needless for me to enlarge upon them any
</p>
<p>longer. I only beseech you to draw from them two

</p>
<p>till he has undone himself. We deceive ourselves
</p>
<p>if we think fortune has raised those whom we
</p>
<p>hate to the highest pinnacle of happiness, on purpose
</p>
<p>to give us the pleasure of seeing them fall. Grandeui*
</p>
<p>is not always bordered with precipices ; usurpers
</p>
<p>have not always been unhappy ; and heaven is not
</p>
<p>always ready at hand, in the punishing bad men,
</p>
<p>to aid the good, and free them from the violence
</p>
<p>of their oppressors. Nature, more infallible than
</p>
<p>politics, instructs us to prevent the evil which
</p>
<p>threatens us, and which becomes incurable whilst
</p>
<p>prudence is considering its remedies. To what
</p>
<p>end should we so nicely examine the exam-
</p>
<p>ples which have been proposed to us ? Do we
</p>
<p>not know that too great a subtlety in arguing
</p>
<p>softens our courage, and is often opposite to the
</p>
<p>greatest actions ? All affairs bear two different
</p>
<p>aspects ; and the same politicians who blame Poni-
</p>
<p>pey for having strengthened Caesar's power by in-
</p>
<p>censing him, have praised the conduct of Cicero
</p>
<p>in ruining Catiline. The other benefit which you
</p>
<p>ought to reap from these considerations is, that the
</p>
<p>great abilities with which Nature has endowed
</p>
<p>you, ought not to resemble those faint and ineffec-
</p>
<p>tual fires which afford only a dim glimmering of
</p>
<p>light without any heat, but ought to be like the
</p>
<p>light of the sun, which produces what it enlightens.

</p>
<p>makes any impression on your mind, I have rea-
</p>
<p>son to fear that it will stop tlie course of your am-
</p>
<p>bition ; for I know that one of so scrupulous a
</p>
<p>disposition, and so jealous of honour as you are,
</p>
<p>will hardly bear to be sullied with those terrible
</p>
<p>names of rebel and traitor. Yet these mighty
</p>
<p>scarecrows, which public opinion has framed to
</p>
<p>frighten the minds of the vulgar, never bring any
</p>
<p>shame to those who bear them for extraordinary
</p>
<p>actions, when they are attended with success.
</p>
<p>Scruples and greatness have ever been incompati-
</p>
<p>ble, and the narrow precepts of common prudence
</p>
<p>are fitter to be taught in the school of the people
</p>
<p>than in that of great men. The crime of usurping
</p>
<p>a crown is of so illustrious a nature, that it may
</p>
<p>pass for a virtue. Every degree of men has its
</p>
<p>peculiar reputation ; the common sort ought to be
</p>
<p>esteemed for their moderation, and the great ones
</p>
<p>for their ambition and courage. A poor pirate,
</p>
<p>who used to take little vessels in the time of
</p>
<p>Alexander, passed for an infamous robber ; whilst
</p>
<p>that prince, who took whole kingdoms from their
</p>
<p>rightful sovereigns, is to this day honoured as a
</p>
<p>hero ; and if Catiline is blamed as a traitor, Caesar
</p>
<p>is spoken of as the greatest man that ever lived.
</p>
<p>In short, I need only set before your eyes all the
</p>
<p>princes now reigning in the world, and ask you if
</p>
<p>those from whom they hold their crowns were not
</p>
<p>usui-pers ? But if these maxims are any way dis-
</p>
<p>agreeable to the nicety of your principles ; if the
</p>
<p>love of your country weighs more with you than
</p>
<p>your private glory ; if you have yet any regard

<p>let us examine what lionour will accrue to you
</p>
<p>174 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>from respecting it when your enemies despise it^
</p>
<p>and whether it will be any great advantage to you
</p>
<p>to run the hazard of becoming their subject. Would
</p>
<p>to God the state were in its first splendour ! nobody
</p>
<p>should then dissuade you, more strenuously than I,
</p>
<p>from the design to which I now excite you. If
</p>
<p>this commonwealth, which now retains nothing of
</p>
<p>liberty but the name, could preserve its authority,
</p>
<p>weak as it is, in the condition in which it is now
</p>
<p>placed, I own that there would be some reason to
</p>
<p>bear our misfortune with patience ; and that if it was
</p>
<p>neither safe nor useful, it would at least be gene-
</p>
<p>rous, to sacrifice our own interests to the vain image
</p>
<p>which is left us of liberty. But now that the artifices
</p>
<p>of Andrew Doria have confined the councils of the
</p>
<p>whole commonwealth to his single person, and the
</p>
<p>insolence of Giannetino has put all its forces into his
</p>
<p>hands ; at the instant that Genoa has reached the
</p>
<p>period of its change, by that sacred but inevitable
</p>
<p>fate which sets certain bounds to the revolutions
</p>
<p>of all states ; now that the minds of the citizens
</p>
<p>are too little united to live any longer under the
</p>
<p>government of many ; in this extremity, I say,
</p>
<p>when tyranny can be no longer resisted but by
</p>
<p>establishing a lawful monarchy, what are we to
</p>
<p>do ? Shall we offer our throats to be cut by those
</p>
<p>murderers who would join our ruin to that of the
</p>
<p>public liberty ? Shall Count John Lewis de Fiesco
</p>
<p>look on with patience whilst Giannetino Doria in-
</p>
<p>solently ascends the throne to which his fortune and

<p>his ambition raised him, without any one quality

<p>as to be obliged, as you now are by the motive of
</p>
<p>the public good, and your private glory, to set a
</p>
<p>crown on your head. Do not fear that this action
</p>
<p>should acquire you the name of an interested man.
</p>
<p>On the contrary, nothing but the fear of danger,
</p>
<p>which is the meanest of all interests, can hinder
</p>
<p>your undertaking it ; and nothing but glory, which
</p>
<p>is directly opposite to interest, is capable of prompt-
</p>
<p>ing you to so great a design. If you are so nice that
</p>
<p>you cannot bear the appearance of blame, what
</p>
<p>will hinder you from restoring to your country
</p>
<p>that liberty which you have acquired for it, and
</p>
<p>from surrendering to it the crown which you will
</p>
<p>80 well have deserved ? It will then be in your
</p>
<p>own power to give a signal proof of the contempt
</p>
<p>you have for all kinds of interest, when you can
</p>
<p>part with it, and preserve your honour. The only
</p>
<p>thing that remains for me to represent to you is,
</p>
<p>that in my opinion you ought not to make use of
</p>
<p>the French. Any intelligence with foreigners is
</p>
<p>extremely odious ; but in the present juncture, that
</p>
<p>which you propose cannot be useful to you, be-
</p>
<p>cause, as Calcagno has observed, France is now
</p>
<p>sufficiently employed in defending itself against
</p>
<p>the Spanish and Imperial forces, which attack it
</p>
<p>powerfully on all sides. But supposing you could
</p>
<p>draw any assistance thence, consider that your
</p>
<p>altering your condition would only be changing
</p>
<p>your slavery ; that you would be a slave to France,
</p>
<p>whose ally you may now become. Upon the
</p>
<p>whole, determine whether it is fit for a man of
</p>
<p>your abilities, merit, and quality, to resolve to suffer
</p>
<p>every thing, and be a victim to Doria's insolence ;

<p>Eaphael Sacco, who acted as judge within the
</p>
<p>territories of the house of Fiesco, and who was the
</p>
<p>third person called to this council, seeing that the
</p>
<p>Count's inclinations were entirely conformable to
</p>
<p>Verrina's sentiments, thought that it would be
</p>
<p>to no purpose to contradict them ; and on the
</p>
<p>other hand, judging that that action was extremely
</p>
<p>hazardous, he would not ^.dvise him to undertake
</p>
<p>it, and did not declare his opinion on that subject,
</p>
<p>referring himself (as to the main design) entirely
</p>
<p>to his master's will. Wherefore he applied him-
</p>
<p>self only to maintain, that if it was absolutely re-
</p>
<p>solved upon, it was necessary to make use of the
</p>
<p>French, saying that it would be an extraordinary
</p>
<p>piece of imprudence for the Count not to use all
</p>
<p>his credit and his forces where he ventured his
</p>
<p>whole fortune. That he could not understand

<p>how they came to advise the Count, to oppose

<p>himself singly to the arms of the Empire, Spain,
</p>
<p>and Italy, which would certainly unite against

</p>
<p>by surprise, but not to secure a state ; that tliis
</p>
<p>last could not be done without a long series of

<p>years, without troops and alliances ; and that the

<p>thought of seizing upon the sovereignty of Genoa,

<p>in the present disposition of the aiTairs of Europe

<p>ject in his discourse ; by representing to him,
</p>
<p>more strongly than before, that the friendsliip of
</p>
<p>princes never outlived their interest, and that
</p>
<p>though the favour of the House of Austria seemed
</p>
<p>inseparably united to the Dorias, because they
</p>
<p>were useful to that House, it would be at an end
</p>
<p>as soon as they ceased to be so : whereas, if the
</p>
<p>Emperor saw the Count in a condition to be either
</p>
<p>useful or hurtful to him, he would soon forget the
</p>
<p>services of the others, and seek his friendship ; but
</p>
<p>that if he called in the French (besides that they
</p>
<p>are easily tired with every thing, and that their
</p>
<p>application to foreign att'airs is subject to be in-
</p>
<p>tiuenced by the frequent revolutions which happen
</p>
<p>within that kingdom, and depends on the genius
</p>
<p>of those who govern), he must debar himself of
</p>
<p>all means of an accommodation with the Emperor,
</p>
<p>whose power in Italy was more considerable than
</p>
<p>theirs ; that it would therefore be time enough to
</p>
<p>seek the aid of France when he should see him-
</p>
<p>self entirely excluded from an alliance with tho
</p>
<p>Empire ; in which case, the interest of the French
</p>
<p>would be so far concerned not to abandon him,
</p>
<p>that they would not fail to succour him, because

<p>the Count remaining master of Genoa, they would
</p>
<p>always be in fear of his agreeing with their ene-

<p>mies, if they refused him the assistance which was
</p>
<p>necessary for his defence. That as to forces, there
</p>
<p>were no need of any greater to succeed in this de-
</p>
<p>sign, than those which he had of his own, since he
</p>
<p>knew that there were but 230 soldiers in Genoa,

<p>and that Giannetino Doria's galleys were entirely

<p>disarmed. These reasons entirely determined the

</p>
<p>which made nothing appear difficult to him that
</p>
<p>was honourable. In fine, he resolved to engage in
</p>
<p>this undertaking in his own strength, and to em-
</p>
<p>ploy none in it, but those friends and servants
</p>
<p>which his high birth, his extraordinary courtesy,
</p>
<p>his inexhaustable liberality, and his other good
</p>
<p>qualities, had acquired for him.
</p>
<p>There are many persons who have merit, cou-
</p>
<p>rage, and ambition, and who form general ideas of
</p>
<p>raising themselves and improving tlieir condition.
</p>
<p>But it is rare to meet with such as, having formed
</p>
<p>those ideas, know how to make choice of proper
</p>
<p>means for their execution, and who are not re-
</p>
<p>miss in the continual care which is necessary to
</p>
<p>bring them to eflect ; or, when they take that pains,
</p>
<p>they generally time it ill, and act with too much
</p>
<p>impatience for the event. This is so true, that
</p>
<p>in aflPairs of this nature, most men are too long
</p>
<p>in taking their resolutions, but will never allow
</p>
<p>themselves the necessary time for executing what
</p>
<p>they have resolved. They do not think early
</p>
<p>enough of disposing their actions to the end which
</p>
<p>they have proposed to themselves, to direct all
</p>
<p>their steps to the plan wliich they have once form-
</p>
<p>ed, to establish a stock of reputation, to gain
</p>
<p>friends, and finally, to centre all their views in the
</p>
<p>execution of their first design. On the contrary,
</p>
<p>we see them often change their views on a sud-
</p>
<p>den, their mind appears disquieted and overbur-
</p>
<p>dened with the secret and the weight of their en-

<p>of their conduct, they always let slip something

<p>them, and ofience to their enemies.
</p>
<p>The Count de Fiesco very wisely remedied

<p>III. THE REVOLT OF COUiNT FIESCO. 179
</p>
<p>these inconveniences ; for, knowinnj that he was
</p>
<p>naturally inclined to great things, and seeing that
</p>
<p>he should one day he able to bring these general
</p>
<p>inclinations to some particular and important de-
</p>
<p>sign, which might tend to his own greatness, he
</p>
<p>gave himself entirely up to that thought ; and as
</p>
<p>he had of himself an incredible passion for glory,
</p>
<p>and a great deal of art to increase his reputation,
</p>
<p>he lived in such a manner, that all the great qua-
</p>
<p>lities that were to be observed in him seemed to
</p>
<p>proceed from his native disposition, and not from a
</p>
<p>studied conduct. He had always the same open,
</p>
<p>agi'eeable, and pleasant countenance : He was civil
</p>
<p>to every one, though with proper distinctions,
</p>
<p>according to different merit and quality. His libe-
</p>
<p>rality was so great, that he prevented the wants of
</p>
<p>his friends ; thus he gained the poor by his boun-
</p>
<p>ty, and the rich by his civility. He always kept
</p>
<p>his word religiously ; he had an unwearied desire
</p>
<p>of obliging ; his house and table were open to all
</p>
<p>persons ; he was magnificent in every thing, even
</p>
<p>to profuseness ; and never was any one better per-
</p>
<p>suaded than he, that covetousness, stiffness, and
</p>
<p>pride, obscure the most shining qualities of great
</p>
<p>men. But what gave an extraordinary lustre to
</p>
<p>those he was possessed of, was the handsomeness of
</p>
<p>his person, and the graceful and noble air with which
</p>
<p>all his actions were accompanied, which were dis-
</p>
<p>tinguishing marks of his illustrious birth, and which
</p>
<p>attracted every one's respect and inclination.
</p>
<p>Tliis conduct so secured for him the hearts of
</p>
<p>his friends, that not one of those who promised to
</p>
<p>serve him, failed either in his fidelity or discre-

<p>deed, is very extraordinary in a conspiracy where

</p>
<p>SO many actors and so much secrecy are required,
</p>
<p>that, though it should happen that none should
</p>
<p>prove treacherous, it is hard to imagine that none
</p>
<p>should prove imprudent. But what was most
</p>
<p>wonderful in this was, that his enemies, seeing his
</p>
<p>open conduct, took no offence at it, because they
</p>
<p>attributed what was too shining in his actions to
</p>
<p>his natural temper, and not to a formed design.
</p>
<p>This was without doubt one of the causes of the
</p>
<p>contempt with which Andrew Doria received the
</p>
<p>advices that were given him by Ferdinando Gon-
</p>
<p>zaga and two or three others concerning this en-
</p>
<p>terprise ; I say one of the causes, because, though
</p>
<p>the conduct of the Count contributed to the taking
</p>
<p>away the diffidence of this old politician, jealous
</p>
<p>of his authority, there must nevertheless have been
</p>
<p>some other reason for so great an infatuation. But
</p>
<p>it is hard to find out that cause, unless we ascribe
</p>
<p>it to Providence, which delights in showing the
</p>
<p>vanity of human prudence, and in confounding the
</p>
<p>pride of those who flatter themselves that they can
</p>
<p>unravel the several windings of the hearts of men,
</p>
<p>and that they have an infallible discernment for all
</p>
<p>things in the world. This presumption is never
</p>
<p>more ridiculous than in those great men whom
</p>
<p>continual study, profound meditation, and long ex-
</p>
<p>perience in affairs, have so raised above the vulgar,
</p>
<p>and so intoxicated with a good opinion of them-
</p>
<p>selves, that they rely on the confidence of their
</p>
<p>own judgment in the most difficult affairs, and hear

<p>greater importance to themselves. They are more
</p>
<p>unhappy than others, because they cannot guide
</p>
<p>themselves either by their own reason or by that
</p>
<p>of their friends.
</p>
<p>The act of generosity which gained the Count
</p>
<p>de Fiesco many friends amongst the people, was
</p>
<p>his bounty to the silk-spinners, who made a cou"
</p>
<p>siderable body of the inhabitants of Genoa. They
</p>
<p>were at that time extremely distressed by the
</p>
<p>misery occasioned by the late wars ; the Count
</p>
<p>liaving learnt their condition from their consul, ex-
</p>
<p>pressed a great concern at their poverty, and, at the
</p>
<p>vsame time ordered him to send those of them to his
</p>
<p>palace who had most need of relief. He supplied
</p>
<p>them abundantly with money and provisions, and
</p>
<p>begged them not to make any noise about his pre-
</p>
<p>sents, because he expected no other reward from
</p>
<p>them but the satisfaction he felt within himself in
</p>
<p>succouring the afflicted ; and accompanying these
</p>
<p>things with his natural courteousness and civility, he
</p>
<p>so gained the hearts of these poor people, that they
</p>
<p>were from that time entirely devoted to his service.
</p>
<p>But if, on the one hand, he gained the love and
</p>
<p>esteem of the poorest amongst the people by his
</p>
<p>liberalities, he did not forget, on the other, to
</p>
<p>make himself agreeable to the most considerable
</p>
<p>of them, by the promises of liberty which he art-
</p>
<p>fully insinuated in his discourses, wherein he gave
</p>
<p>them to understand, that though he was of the
</p>
<p>body of the nobility, he was too reasonable not to
</p>
<p>sympathize, with a great deal of sorrow, in the

<p>maintain, that it was most imprudent in the
</p>
<p>senate to suft'er the Count thus to obHge every
</p>
<p>body, and to gain with so much care the hearts
</p>
<p>of his fellow-citizens. I cannot deny that the
</p>
<p>maxim, on which this opinion is founded proceeds
</p>
<p>from the most refined politics ; for it seems that,
</p>
<p>aiming at the keeping private people in a state of
</p>
<p>mediocrity, its natural effect ought to be the safety
</p>
<p>of the whole. But I am satisfied that it is very
</p>
<p>unjust, because it corrupts the nature of good qua-
</p>
<p>lities, which by that means become hurtful or dan-
</p>
<p>gerous to the person that is possessed of them.
</p>
<p>I think the maxim even pernicious, because, by
</p>
<p>rendering merit suspicious, it chokes up all the
</p>
<p>seeds of virtue, and so disgusts men from the love
</p>
<p>of glory, that they never undertake great actions
</p>
<p>but with fear ; and they even are diverted from
</p>
<p>those which might be useful to the commonwealth,
</p>
<p>to avoid giving umbrage to the government. It
</p>
<p>happens also, that instead of keeping men of cou-
</p>

<p>tence of the fear he feigned to be in of the Duke
</p>
<p>of Placentia. He was also willing to give the
</p>
<p>III. THE REVOLT OF COUNT FIESCO. 183
</p>
<p>necessary orders for his design of secretly in-
</p>
<p>troducing some men into Genoa, when occasion
</p>
<p>should require it, and of assuring himself of the
</p>
<p>sentiments of that Duke, who had promised him
</p>
<p>2000 men of his hest troops.
</p>
<p>The Count, returning about the latter end of
</p>
<p>autumn, added to his usual conduct a profound
</p>
<p>dissimulation in what related to the House of
</p>
<p>Doria, expressing, on all occasions, a great vene-
</p>
<p>ration for the person of Andrew, and a strict
</p>
<p>friendship for Giannetino, in order to show all the
</p>
<p>world that their past divisions were entirely laid
</p>
<p>aside, and to give them all imaginable marks of
</p>
<p>an union that might be securely relied upon.
</p>
<p>If what he said on the very day that he exe-
</p>
<p>cuted his enterprise be true, that he had long be-
</p>
<p>fore been acquainted that his ruin had been re-
</p>
<p>solved on by Giannetino Doria, and that that violent
</p>
<p>and unjust man, who was only restrained by the
</p>
<p>prudence of liis uncle Andrew, whom he found
</p>
<p>subject to great distempers, had ordered Captain
</p>
<p>Lercaro to rid him of all the family of Fiesco, the
</p>
<p>moment that Andrew Doria should die ; that he
</p>
<p>had letters beside him, which were convincing proofs
</p>
<p>that Giannetino had endeavoured to poison him three
</p>
<p>several times ; and that he was, l/esides, certainly
</p>
<p>assured that the Emperor was ready to make him
</p>
<p>sovereign of Genoa. If, I say, all these things
</p>
<p>be true, I cannot think tliat the Count's dissimu-
</p>
<p>lation can be justly blamed ; because, in affairs
</p>
<p>where our own life and the general interest of our
</p>
<p>country are at stake, sincerity is a virtue out of
</p>
<p>season ; nature teaching us, by the example of

<p>lawful to defend ourselves from violence and op-
</p>
<p>pression.
</p>
<p>But if the Count's complaints were only calum-
</p>
<p>nies invented against the House of Doria, to give
</p>
<p>the better colour to his design, and to exasperate
</p>
<p>people's minds, it cannot be denied that these false
</p>
<p>marks of friendship, which he so affectedly gave
</p>
<p>them, were artifices unworthy of his great cou-
</p>
<p>rage. And without doubt it would be difticult to
</p>
<p>justify such a conduct, but by the necessity which
</p>
<p>the insolence and power of Giannetino had imposed
</p>
<p>on him to live in that manner.
</p>
<p>The Count had purchased four galleys from the
</p>
<p>Duke of Placentia, which he kept in the Pope's
</p>
<p>pay, under the name of his brother Jerome. As he
</p>
<p>judged that the most necessary thing to his design
</p>
<p>was to make himself master of the port, he sent
</p>
<p>for one of them to Genoa, under pretence of send-
</p>
<p>ing it on a cruise to the Levant, and at the same
</p>
<p>ime took occasion to get into the city, without
</p>
<p>suspicion, some of the soldiers which came to him
</p>
<p>from his territories and from Placentia, whereof
</p>
<p>some passed for people of the garrison, some for
</p>
<p>adventurers that were seeking employment, some
</p>
<p>for seamen, and a great many even for galley
</p>
<p>slaves.
</p>
<p>Verrina very artfully introduced amongst the
</p>
<p>companies of the city fifteen or twenty soldiers,
</p>
<p>who were vassals to the Count, and corrupted
</p>
<p>others of the garrison. He obtained promises from
</p>
<p>the most considerable and most enterprising among
</p>
<p>the people, of all manner of assistance in the exe-
</p>
<p>cution of a private design, intended, as he said,

<p>less diligence and industry ; and I think I cannot
</p>
<p>better express the art with wliich these four per-
</p>
<p>sons conducted this enterprise, than by saying that
</p>
<p>they engaged in it above ten thousand people,
</p>
<p>without discovering their true -design to any one.
</p>
<p>Things being thus disposed, nothing was want-
</p>
<p>ing but the choice of a day for the execution, in
</p>
<p>which there happened some ditficulties. Verrina's
</p>
<p>opinion was, that they should invite to a new
</p>
<p>mass * Giannetino and Andrew Doria, and Adam
</p>
<p>Centurioni, with those of the nobility who were
</p>
<p>the best affected to that party. He offered to kill
</p>
<p>them himself. This proposal was no sooner made
</p>
<p>than rejected by the Count, who conceived so
</p>
<p>much horror at it, that he cried out that he would
</p>
<p>never consent to profane the most sacred mystery
</p>
<p>of our religion to facilitate the success of his un-
</p>
<p>dertaking. It was afterwards proposed to take
</p>
<p>the opportunity of the marriage of a sister of
</p>
<p>Giannetino Doria's with Julius Cibo, Marquis de
</p>
<p>Masse, the Count's brother-in-law, and they judged
</p>
<p>that the execution of their design would be easier
</p>
<p>on that occasion, because the Count would have
</p>
<p>the pretence of making an entertainment for all
</p>
<p>the relations of that family, and thereby be fur-
</p>
<p>nished with the means of cutting them all off at a
</p>
<p>blow. But the Count's generosity moved him
</p>
<p>again to oppose this black piece of treachery, as
</p>
<p>many people assert, and it may easily be believed
</p>
<p>of one of his disposition ; although Doria's friends

<p>have given out that he had resolved to make use
</p>
<p>of tliat way, if au aflPair which caused Giannetino
</p>
<p>Doria, on that very day, to take a short journey out
</p>
<p>of Genoa, had not changed his mind. At last,
</p>
<p>after several deliberations, the night of the second of
</p>
<p>January was pitched upon for this enterprise, and
</p>
<p>the necessary orders were at the same time given
</p>
<p>out with a great deal of conduct, Verrina, Calcag-
</p>
<p>no, and Sacco, disposing on their side of those
</p>
<p>whom they had gained. The Count got a great
</p>
<p>number of arms secretly conveyed into his palace,
</p>
<p>and sent to observe the places of which they were
</p>
<p>to make themselves masters ; he introduced by
</p>
<p>small numbers, and without noise, into a part of
</p>
<p>his palace, separate from the rest, the soldiers who
</p>
<p>were destined to begin the execution : And the
</p>
<p>appointed day being come, the better to cover his
</p>
<p>design, he made a great many visits, and even went
</p>
<p>towards evening to the palace of Doria, where
</p>
<p>meeting Giannetino's children, he took them one
</p>
<p>after another in his arms, and played with them a
</p>
<p>long time before their father, whom he afterwards
</p>
<p>desired to give orders to the officers of his galleys,
</p>
<p>not to hinder the departure of the Count's galley,
</p>
<p>which was that night to sail to the Levant : after
</p>
<p>which he took leave of him with his usual civili-
</p>
<p>ties, and in going home he called on Tomaso As-
</p>
<p>sereto, with whom he met above thirty of those gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen who were called popular, whom Verrina had
</p>
<p>caused him to meet there, as by accident, whence
</p>
<p>the Count canied them all to sup with him. When
</p>
<p>he arrived at his palace, he sent Venina all over the

<p>usual, he ordered tlie doors of liis palace to be
</p>
<p>8hut, with direction, however, to let in all those
</p>
<p>who should desire it, but to let out no person
</p>
<p>whatsoever.
</p>
<p>As he perceived that his guests were extremely
</p>
<p>surprised to find, instead of a feast prepared for
</p>
<p>them, nothing but arms, strange faces, and soldiers,
</p>
<p>he gathered them together in a hall, and expressing
</p>
<p>in his countenance a noble assurance, he spoke to
</p>
<p>them in this manner :
</p>
<p>" We have, my friends, already suffered too
</p>
<p>much, from the insolence of Giannetino, and the
</p>
<p>tyranny of Andrew Doria. We have not a mo-
</p>
<p>ment to lose, if we have a mind to secure our
</p>
<p>lives and liberties from the oppression that threatens
</p>
<p>them. Is there any one here that can be ignorant
</p>
<p>of the pressing danger of the commonwealth ?
</p>
<p>What can you imagine the twenty galleys which
</p>
<p>besiege our harbour are intended for ? What is
</p>
<p>the design of all the forces and the intelligence
</p>
<p>which these two tyrants have prepared ? Behold
</p>
<p>them ready to triumph over our patience, and to
</p>
<p>build their unjust authority on the ruins of this
</p>
<p>state. It is now no longer time to deplore our
</p>
<p>miseries in private, we must hazard all things to
</p>
<p>free ourselves from them. Since the evil is so
</p>
<p>violent, the remedies must be so too ; and if the
</p>
<p>fear of falling into the most shameful slavery has
</p>
<p>any power over your minds, you must make a vi-
</p>
<p>gorous attempt to break your fetters, and prevent
</p>
<p>those that would load you with new ones ; for I
</p>
<p>cannot imagine you any longer capable of bearing
</p>
<p>the uncle's injustice, or the nephew's pride. I

</p>
<p>who ought to think themselves honoured enougfi
</p>
<p>with being your equals. Were we insensible to
</p>
<p>the interest of the commonwealth, we cannot be
</p>
<p>so to our own. Every one of us has but too much
</p>
<p>reason to revenge himself, and our revenge is both
</p>
<p>just and glorious, since our private resentment is
</p>
<p>joined to our zeal for the public good, and that we
</p>
<p>cannot abandon our own interests without betray-
</p>
<p>ing those of our country. It is now in your power
</p>
<p>to secure its quiet and your own ; you want only
</p>
<p>the will to be happy, to become so. I have pro-
</p>
<p>vided for every thing which might obstruct your
</p>
<p>happiness ; I have laid open to you a way to glory,
</p>
<p>and am ready to lead you in it, if you are disposed
</p>
<p>to follow me. The preparations you see here
</p>
<p>ought at this time to encourage you more than
</p>
<p>they have surprised you ; and the astonishment
</p>
<p>which I at first observed in your faces, ought to
</p>
<p>be changed into a glorious resolution of employ-
</p>
<p>ing these warlike instruments with vigour, to work
</p>
<p>the destruction of our common enemies, and the
</p>
<p>preservation of our liberty. I should offend your
</p>
<p>courage if I imagined you capable, at the sight of
</p>
<p>these objects, to deliberate about the use of them.
</p>
<p>That use is certain, by the good order which I
</p>
<p>hope to put things into ; it is of the greatest ad-
</p>
<p>vantage to you ; it is just, because of the oppres-
</p>
<p>sion you suffer ; it is glorious, by th(; greatness of
</p>
<p>tlie undertaking. I might prove by these letters,
</p>
<p>that the Emperor has promised Andrew Doria the
</p>
<p>sovereignty of Genoa, and is ready to fulfil his
</p>
<p>promise. I could sliow you, by other letters I
</p>
<p>possess, that Giannetino has three times attempted

<p>to hire people to poison me. It would be easy for

<p>me to prove to you, that he has given orders to

<p>Lcrcaro to murder me and all my family, the mo-
</p>
<p>ment his uncle should die ; but tlie knowledge of
</p>
<p>all these iiorrid and infamous treacheries, would
</p>
<p>add nothing to the horror you already have for
</p>
<p>these monsters. Methinks I see your eyes sparkle
</p>
<p>with the generous fire with which a just revenge in-
</p>
<p>spires you ; I see you are more impatient than I
</p>
<p>to express your resentment, to insure your estates,
</p>
<p>your peace, and the honour of your families. Let
</p>
<p>us then, my dear fellow-citizens, save the reputa-
</p>
<p>tion of Genoa ; let us preserve our country's li-
</p>
<p>berty ; and let us show the world, that there are
</p>
<p>yet left in this state honest men who have the
</p>
<p>heart to bring tyrants to destruction. "
</p>
<p>The company were very much astonished at
</p>
<p>these words ; but as almost all of them were zea-
</p>
<p>lous friends to Count de Fiesco, and as some of
</p>
<p>them joined to that friendship the exalted hopes
</p>
<p>with which they flattered themselves, in case their
</p>
<p>enterprise succeeded, and the rest feared his re-
</p>
<p>sentment if they refused to follow his fortune,
</p>
<p>they promised him all manner of service. There
</p>
<p>were but two amongst that number, which was
</p>
<p>pretty considerable, that begged of him not to en-
</p>
<p>gage them in that affair ; whether their profession,
</p>
<p>remote from dangers, and their humour, averse to
</p>
<p>violence, rendered them incapable (as they said)
</p>
<p>to be of any service in an action where many dan-
</p>
<p>gers were to be mn, and many murders to be com-
</p>
<p>mitted ; or whether they covered, under the ap-
</p>
<p>pearance of a dissembled fear, the real affection
</p>
<p>which they had for the House of Doria, or for some
</p>
<p>of his party. It is certain that the Count pressed

<p>thera no farther, and was satisfied with shutting
</p>
<p>them up in a room, to take from them the means

</p>
<p>of discovering his design. His gentle usage of
</p>
<p>these two persons, makes me disbelieve what se-
</p>
<p>veral historians, prejudiced against his memory,
</p>
<p>have published ; which is, that the discourse he
</p>
<p>made in this assembly was filled with nothing but
</p>
<p>threats against those who should refuse to assist
</p>
<p>him ; and I believe that we may with reason form
</p>
<p>the same judgment of the cruel and impious words
</p>
<p>which they put into his mouth on the night of the
</p>
<p>execution of his enterprise. For what likelihood
</p>
<p>is there that a man of his condition, born with an
</p>
<p>extraordinary passion for glory, should suffer him-
</p>
<p>self to be transported to such expressions as can-
</p>
<p>not be remembered without hoiTor, and could be
</p>
<p>of no manner of use to his designs ? Be that as
</p>
<p>it will, as soon as he had ended his speech to
</p>
<p>those persons, and had informed them of the or-
</p>
<p>der of his enterprise, he went into his lady's a-
</p>
<p>partment, whom he found in tears, foreseeing that
</p>
<p>the great preparations which were making in the
</p>
<p>house, could not but be designed by her husband
</p>
<p>for some dangerous undertaking. He, therefore,
</p>
<p>thought it proper no longer to conceal the truth
</p>
<p>from her, but he endeavoured to take away her
</p>
<p>fears by all the reasons which he could think of;
</p>
<p>and he represented to her how far he had engaged
</p>
<p>himself, and the impossibility of retreating. She
</p>
<p>did her utmost to dissuade him from that action,
</p>
<p>and made use of the power which his love for her
</p>
<p>gave her over his mind ; but neither her prayers
</p>
<p>nor tears could shake his resolution. Paul Pansa,
</p>
<p>who had been his governor, and for whom he had

<p>a great veneration, joined with the Countess, and

<p>hazard he ran in this occasion. The Count was as
</p>
<p>little moved with his governor's exhortations, as he
</p>
<p>had been with the fondness and tears of his wife. *
</p>
<p>He had (as it is said of Caesar) passed the Rubi-
</p>
<p>con, and returned to the hall where he had left his
</p>
<p>guests. He gave the last directions for the exe-
</p>
<p>cution of his enterprise. He ordered an hundred
</p>
<p>and fifty men, chosen from his best soldiers, to
</p>
<p>go into that part of the city called the borough,
</p>
<p>whither he was to follow them, accompanied by
</p>
<p>the nobility. Cornelius, his natural brother, had
</p>
<p>orders, as soon as they came thither, to march
</p>
<p>(with a detachment of thirty men) to the gate of
</p>
<p>the arch, and to make himself master of it. Jerome
</p>
<p>and Ottobon, his brothers, with Vincent Calcagno,
</p>
<p>were charged to take the gate of St Thomas, when
</p>
<p>they heard the cannon fired from the Count's gal-
</p>
<p>ley, commanded by Verrina, which was ready to
</p>
<p>shut up the mouth of the basin, and to invest that
</p>
<p>of Andrew Doria. The Count was to get to that
</p>
<p>gate by land, after he had left guards in his way at
</p>
<p>the arches of St Andrew and St Donatus, and at
</p>
<p>the Place des Sauvages, with the least noise pos-
</p>
<p>sible. -|- Thomas Assereto was ordered to seize that

<p> After trying in vain to soothe his Countess, whose
</p>
<p>name was Leonora, of an illustrious Genoese family,
</p>
<p>Fiesco, almost overcome by the feelings with which her
</p>
<p>tenderness had inspired him, rushed from her, exclaiming,
</p>
<p>as he quitted the apartment, " Farewell, you shall either
</p>
<p>never see me more, or you shall behold to-morrow every
</p>
<p>thing in Genoa subject to your power. '' Mascardi has
</p>
<p>given the Countess' supposed expostulations in a very af-
</p>
<p>fecting manner, which the Cardinal de Retz has omitted.

<p>know, having an employment under Giannetino

</p>
<p>of the enterprise, because, if it failed, those who were
</p>
<p>in the Count's galley could have no communication
</p>
<p>with the rest of the conspirators, it was judged
</p>
<p>proper, to render it still more easy, that Scipio
</p>
<p>Borgognino, a vassal of the Count, and a reso-
</p>
<p>lute soldier, should throw himself into the basin

<p>with armed feluccas, and should laud on that side,

<p>at the same time that Thomas Assereto should at-

<p>tack that gate on the outside. It was also resolv-
</p>
<p>ed, that the moment that Jerome and Ottobon de
</p>
<p>Fiesco should be masters of St Thomas' Gate,
</p>
<p>which was near the palace of Doria, one of them
</p>
<p>should force that palace, and kill Andrew and Gian-
</p>
<p>netino : And because there was some reason to ap-
</p>
<p>prehend that Giannetino, being roused by the noise
</p>
<p>which would be made at the gates, might get into
</p>
<p>Lewis Giulia's felucca to come and give his orders,
</p>
<p>they left three armed feluccas to prevent it. To
</p>
<p>these orders there was added a general one, that
</p>
<p>all the conspirators should call to the people in the
</p>
<p>name of Fiesco, and cry out, Liberty, that those
</p>
<p>of the city whose affection they were assured of,
</p>
<p>might not be surprised, and that, seeing that the
</p>
<p>Count was the author of this action, they might
</p>
<p>join his people.
</p>
<p>It is not easy to determine whether it had not
</p>
<p>been more advantageous and safe to have made but
</p>
<p>one body of all these troops which were separated in
</p>
<p>so many different quarters, so remote from each
</p>
<p>other, than to divide them in that manner ; be-

<p>make it probable, that if they had all entered the

<p>same way into tlie town, they had carried all be-
</p>
<p>foi-e them, and had drawn the people to favour tlie
</p>
<p>victorious party, wherever they had passed : where-
</p>
<p>as, being divided, they could act but weakly, and
</p>
<p>ran the risk of committing mistakes, and of being
</p>
<p>all defeated one after the other. For it is certain
</p>
<p>that a great deal of exactness is requisite to make
</p>
<p>the times of several attacks agree, and a great
</p>
<p>deal of good fortune for them all to succeed alike.
</p>
<p>So many heads and hands are in these occasions
</p>
<p>necessary to concur in the same action, that the
</p>
<p>least fault in one of them often disconcerts all the
</p>
<p>rest, as the disorder of a single wheel may stop
</p>
<p>the motion of tfie greatest machine : and it is very
</p>
<p>difficult to coniteive, that during the night and
</p>
<p>amidst the tunmlt which generally accompanies
</p>
<p>tliese kinds of enterprises, either the heart or the
</p>
<p>judgment of some of the conspirators should not
</p>
<p>fail them, and that thinking danger more terrible
</p>
<p>when near than when afar oft', they should not re-
</p>
<p>pent their engaging in such a design, l^ut when
</p>
<p>they move all together, the example of others ani-
</p>
<p>mates and emboldens the most timorous, who are
</p>
<p>forced to suffer themselves to be carried away by
</p>
<p>the multitude, and to do out of mere necessity
</p>
<p>what the brave do out of courage.
</p>
<p>Those who are of a contrary opinion, hold that
</p>
<p>in these enterprises which are executed by night,
</p>
<p>in a city where the conspirators liave a great deal
</p>
<p>of intelligence, and are favoured by most of the
</p>
<p>people, and vviiere they may make themselves

<p>masters of tlie principal posts before their enemies

<p>ferent attacks in a great many places ; because, by-
</p>
<p>giving several alarms at the same time in different
</p>
<p>parts, those who would defend themselves are ob-
</p>
<p>liged to divide their forces, without knowing how
</p>
<p>many are to be detached ; and the fright which
</p>
<p>such sudden attempts commonly create, is much
</p>
<p>stronger when the noise comes from all sides, than
</p>
<p>when they are only to provide against the danger
</p>
<p>in one single place. Besides, in narrow streets,
</p>
<p>like those of Genoa, * a small number is equally
</p>
<p>as serviceable as a greater, and that ten men, by
</p>
<p>the help of a barricado, if they are attacked only
</p>
<p>in front, may stop an hundred times as many of
</p>
<p>the bravest men in the world, and give time to
</p>
<p>those who are behind them to rally. Lastly, those
</p>
<p>who are of the latter opinion, think that in an enter-
</p>
<p>prise like this, it is less advantageous to the party
</p>
<p>of the conspirators to join their forces in one body,
</p>
<p>than to spread them in different parts of the city,
</p>
<p>having the favour of the greatest part of the in-
</p>
<p>habitants, because they raise them all at once, and
</p>
<p>the citizens are more ready to take up arms when
</p>
<p>they see themselves supported, and are more cap-
</p>
<p>able of serving when they have regular troops and
</p>
<p>people of credit at their head.
</p>
<p>All these reasons being justly weighed on each
</p>
<p>side, I think that the Count acted very judici-
</p>
<p>ously ; for it seems to me that on this occasion,
</p>
<p>the inconveniences which we have just mentioned
</p>
<p>* The streets of Genoa, like all other ancient cities,
</p>
<p>and especially sea-ports, were then extremely inconvenient,
</p>
<p>and are to this day narrow and irregular, with the excep-
</p>
<p>tion of three, the Sirada Bulbi^ the Strada Nuova, and the

</p>
<p>in the way of acting which he made choice of,
</p>
<p>were less to be feared than they commonly are,
</p>
<p>because his party was not only composed of the
</p>
<p>soldiery and nobility, but also of a gi'eat number
</p>
<p>of the common people, of whose fidelity he was as-
</p>
<p>sured. So that, having considerable forces in all the
</p>
<p>quarters of Genoa, he had reason to think that the
</p>
<p>garrison which was extremely weak, and those who
</p>
<p>did not favour him, could be no great hinderance
</p>
<p>to his designs, nor make any resistance sufficient
</p>
<p>to disturb those who fought for him. Having,
</p>
<p>therefore, left his palace, he divided his men ac-
</p>
<p>cording to the order which he had resolved on ;
</p>
<p>and at the same time that the cannon, which was
</p>
<p>ordered for a signal, was fired from his galley, Cor-
</p>
<p>nelius surprised the Gate of the Arch, of which he
</p>
<p>made himself master without any trouble. Ot-
</p>
<p>tobon and Jerome, the Count's brothers, did not
</p>
<p>find so much facility with that of St Thomas, from
</p>
<p>the resistance of Captain Sebastian Lercaro and
</p>
<p>his brother, who maintained their post a con-
</p>
<p>siderable time. But the latter having been killed,
</p>
<p>and the other taken prisoner, some even amongst
</p>
<p>their soldiers who had intelligence of the design,
</p>
<p>by turning their arms in favour of the Fiescos,
</p>
<p>made those of the guard run off, and abandon their
</p>
<p>post to the enemies. Giannetino Doria, awaken-
</p>
<p>ed either by the noise which was made at the gate,
</p>
<p>or by the outcry which was made at the same time
</p>
<p>in the harbour, rose in great haste, and being ac-
</p>
<p>companied by none but a page who carried a flam-
</p>
<p>beau before him, he ran to St Thomas' Gate,
</p>
<p>where, being discovered by the conspirators, he

<p>Doria's life, and gave him time to get on horse-
</p>
<p>back, and to retire fifteen miles from Genoa ; * he-
</p>
<p>cause Jerome de Fiesco, vvlio liad orders from his
</p>
<p>brother to force Doria's palace as soon as he had
</p>
<p>seized St Thomas' Gate, seeing* that Giannetino had
</p>
<p>been killed by his own imprudence, preferred the
</p>
<p>preservation of the immense riches which were in
</p>
<p>the palace, and which it would have been difficult
</p>
<p>to save from the soldiers, to the taking of Andrew
</p>
<p>Doria, whom he no longer looked upon but as a
</p>
<p>worn-out old man, whose ruin was indifferent.
</p>
<p>Whilst these things were doing about St Thomas'
</p>
<p>Gate, Assereto and Scipio Borgognino executed,
</p>
<p>their orders with all possible success ; they killed
</p>
<p>those who made any resistance at the gate next
</p>
<p>the basin, and pushed tlie rest so vigorously, that
</p>
<p>they did not give them time to rally, and at last
</p>
<p>they secured that considerable post.
</p>
<p>The Count having, in his passage, left parties
</p>
<p>to guard those posts which he reckoned the most
</p>
<p>important, got into the basin, the entrance of which
</p>
<p>he found entirely open, and joined himself to Ver-
</p>
<p>rina, who had already attacked, with his galley,
</p>
<p>those of Andrew Doria. He found them almost
</p>
<p>all disarmed, and easily made himself master of
</p>
<p>them. Fearing, in this confusion, that the crew,
</p>
<p>who were chiefly slaves, would mutiny, and relieve
</p>
<p>the captain's galley, in which he heard a great
</p>
<p>noise, he ran in haste to give his orders about it ;
</p>
<p>but while doing so, the board on which he was
</p>
<p>proceeding, overturned, and he fell into the sea.
</p>

</p>
<p>elder Doria left Genoa with very great rcluctanee, and

</p>
<p>The weight of his armour, and the mud, hindered
</p>
<p>him from getting up again ; and he was drowned
</p>
<p>at the very moment when victory had made him
</p>
<p>master of Genoa. The darkness of the night,
</p>
<p>joined to the confused noise that was made on all
</p>
<p>parts, kept from his men the knowledge of this
</p>
<p>accident ; so that, without perceiving the loss they
</p>
<p>had sustained, they made an end of securing the
</p>
<p>harbour and the gallies.
</p>
<p>Ottobon, who was come to that place after he
</p>
<p>had executed his first design, staid to command
</p>
<p>there ; and Jerome, who had followed him, left
</p>
<p>Vincent Calcagno at St Thomas' Gate, and left
</p>
<p>the harbour with two hundred men, to stir up
</p>
<p>the populace in the streets, and collect together as
</p>
<p>many people as he could. Verrina, on the o-
</p>
<p>ther hand, did the same thing ; and thus a great
</p>
<p>number of persons being gathered about them,
</p>
<p>nobody dared appear any longer in the streets
</p>
<p>without declaring for Fiesco's party. The greatest
</p>
<p>part of the nobility kept close at home during the
</p>
<p>noise, every one fearing the plunder of his house.
</p>
<p>The most courageous went to the senate-house *
</p>
<p>with the Emperor's ambassador, who would have
</p>
<p>run away from the city, had it not been for the
</p>
<p>remonstrances of Paul LasagTia, a man of great
</p>
<p>authority among the people. Cardinal Doria and
</p>
<p>Adam Centunone went thither also, and resolved,
</p>
<p>* II Palazza della Signoria. It was the palace of the
</p>
<p>Republic, where those senators had the courage to assem-
</p>
<p>ble, amid the general consternation. It was the ancient

<p>palace of the Doge, and is at present one of the most re-

<p>with Nicolas Franco, at that time head of the

<p>commonwealth, there being then no Duke,* to send
</p>
<p>Boniface Lomellino, Cristoplier Palavicini, and
</p>
<p>Antony Calva, with fifty soldiers of the garrison,
</p>
<p>to defend St Tliomas' Gate. But these having
</p>
<p>met with a body of the conspirators, and being
</p>
<p>abandoned by part of their men, were obliged to
</p>
<p>retire into the house of Adam Centurione, where,
</p>
<p>having met with Francis Grimaldi, Dominic Doria,
</p>
<p>and some other gentlemen, they again took courage,
</p>
<p>and returned to the same gate by a different way.
</p>
<p>But they found it so well guarded, and were
</p>
<p>charged so vigorously, that they left Boniface
</p>
<p>Lomellino prisoner, wlio distinguished himself in
</p>
<p>that action by his courage, and happily escaped
</p>
<p>out of the conspirators' hands.
</p>
<p>The Senate, finding tliat force had been tried
</p>
<p>in vain, had recourse to remonstrances, and de-
</p>
<p>puted another Jerome de Fiesco, f a relation of the
</p>
<p>Count, and Jerome Canevale, to demand of the
</p>
<p>Count the reason of t))at commotion ; and imme-
</p>
<p>diately after Cardinal Doria, who was allied to
</p>
<p>him, assisted by John Baptista Lercaro, and Ber-
</p>
<p>nard Castagno, botli senators, resolved, at the de-
</p>
<p>sire of the Senate, to go and confer with the
</p>
<p>Count, and endeavour to soften liim. But see-

</p>
<p>went through the city he should expose his dig-
</p>
<p>nity (to no purpose) to the insults of an incensed

<p>house. So that the Senate gave that commission
</p>
<p>to Augustino Lomellino, Hector de Fiesco, Ansaklo
</p>
<p>Justinian!, Ambrose Spinola, and John Balliano,
</p>
<p>who, seeing a troop of armed men coming towards
</p>
<p>them, imagined it was the Count, and waited for him
</p>
<p>at St Siro. As soon as the conspirators perceived
</p>
<p>them, tliey charged them, and put Lomellino
</p>
<p>and Hector de Fiesco to flight. Ansaldo Justi-
</p>
<p>niani stood his ground, and, addressing himself to
</p>
<p>Jerome, wiio was at the head of that party, he de-
</p>
<p>manded of him, in the name of the commonwealth,
</p>
<p>where the Count was. The conspirators had just
</p>
<p>heard of his death. Verrina, having long sought
</p>
<p>him in vain, was got into his galley in a despe-
</p>
<p>rate condition, because the news from all quar-
</p>
<p>ters of the town mentioned nothing of his appear-
</p>
<p>ing any where. This made Jerome answer Justi-
</p>
<p>niani boldly, and with the greatest imprudence,
</p>
<p>that it was now no longer time to look for any
</p>
<p>other Count than himself, and that he would have
</p>
<p>the senate-house immediately surrendered to him.
</p>
<p>The Senate having learnt by this discourse the
</p>
<p>death of the Count, resumed their courage, and
</p>
<p>sent twelve gentlemen to rally those of the guard
</p>
<p>and of the people whom they could put in a pos-
</p>
<p>ture of defence. Some, even of the hottest of
</p>
<p>Fiesco's party, began to be surprised ; several, who
</p>
<p>had neither tiie same affection for, nor the same
</p>
<p>confidence in, Jerome, that they had for his brother,
</p>
<p>dispersed themselves at the very report of his
</p>
<p>death ; and confusion getting in amongst the con-
</p>
<p>spirators, those in the senate-house perceived it.

<p>and deliberated whether they should go and at-

<p>tack them, or treat with them. Tiie first of these
</p>
<p>was proposed as the most honouiable way, but the
</p>
<p>200 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>second was followed as the safest. Paul Pansa,
</p>
<p>a man of the greatest consideration in the com-
</p>
<p>monwealth, and ever attached to the house of Fies-
</p>
<p>co, was chosen as the fittest man for that purpose.
</p>
<p>The senate ordered him to carry a general pardon
</p>
<p>to Jerome for himself and his accomplices. He con-
</p>
<p>sented to this agreement at the persuasion of Pan-
</p>
<p>sa. The pardon was signed at the same time,
</p>
<p>and sealed with all the necessary formalities, by
</p>
<p>Ambrose Senaregna secretary to the republic ; and
</p>
<p>thus Jerome deFiesco left Genoa with all those of his
</p>
<p>party, and retired to Montobio. Ottobon, Verrina,
</p>
<p>Calcagno, and Sacco, who had made their escape
</p>
<p>in the Count's galley, steered towards France, and
</p>
<p>arrived at Marseilles, after having sent back to the
</p>
<p>mouth of the Vere, without doing them any hurt,
</p>
<p>Sebastian Lercaro, Manfredo Centurioni, and Vin-
</p>
<p>cent Varcaro, whom they had taken at St Thomas'
</p>
<p>Gate. The Count's body was found at the end of
</p>
<p>four days, and having been left some time on the
</p>
<p>banks of the harbour, without burial, it was at last
</p>
<p>thrown into the sea by the command of Andrew
</p>
<p>Doria. Benedict Centurioni and Dominic Doria,
</p>
<p>were the next day deputed to Andrew to condole
</p>
<p>with him in the name of the republic on the death
</p>
<p>of Giannetino, and to bring him back into the city,
</p>
<p>where he was received with all imaginable honours.
</p>
<p>He went to the senate the day after, where he re-
</p>
<p>presented to them in a vehement declamation,
</p>
<p>which he took care to support with the credit of
</p>
<p>his friends, that the commonwealth was not ob-
</p>
<p>liged to stand to the agreement which they had

<p>made with the Fiescos, since it had been conclud-

<p>suffci-ing subjects to treat in that manner with their
</p>
<p>sovereigns ; and insisted that the impunity of a
</p>
<p>crime of that consequence would be a fatal ex-
</p>
<p>ample to the commonwealth. In short, Andrew
</p>
<p>Doria so artfully covered his private interests un-
</p>
<p>der the veil of the general good, and so well back-
</p>
<p>ed his passion witii his authority, tliat although
</p>
<p>there were many persons that could not ap-
</p>
<p>prove of so great a breach of public faith, the se-
</p>
<p>nate nevertheless declared all the conspirators
</p>
<p>guilty of high treason, ordered the magnificent
</p>
<p>palace of Fiesco to be razed to the ground, con-
</p>
<p>demned the Count's brothers and the principal of
</p>
<p>his faction to death, punished with a fifty years
</p>
<p>banishment all those who had the least hand in
</p>
<p>that enterprise, and ordered that Jerome de Fiesco
</p>
<p>should be commanded to surrender the fortress of.
</p>
<p>Montobio into the hands of the republic. This
</p>
<p>last point was not so easy to execute as the rest,
</p>
<p>and as the place^was strong by its situation, and
</p>
<p>by its fortifications which they were continually at
</p>
<p>work upon ; it was judged properest to try the
</p>
<p>most gentle means to get it out of the hands of the
</p>
<p>Fiescos, before they made use of force, the suc-
</p>
<p>cess of which is always doubtful. Paul Pansa
</p>
<p>had orders from the senate to go thither as soon as
</p>
<p>possible, and to offer Jerome reasonable conditions
</p>
<p>on the part of the commonwealth ; but they re-
</p>
<p>ceived no other answer from him but reproaches
</p>
<p>for breaking faith with his friends, and a pretty
</p>
<p>haughty refusal to treat with the Genoese. The

<p>tation, had that employment ; he invested the place,
</p>
<p>which. he besieged for forty days, and at last ob-
</p>
<p>liged those who were in it to surrender at discre-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>Some historians accuse Verrina, Calcagno, and
</p>
<p>Sacco, of having advised Jerome to so dishonourable
</p>
<p>a capitulation, by reason of the cold reception they
</p>
<p>had received in France, whence they were return-
</p>
<p>ed, to throw themselves into that place. The ta-
</p>
<p>king of it created new disorders in the common-
</p>
<p>wealth, on account of the variety of opinions amongst
</p>
<p>the senators touching the punishment of the pri-
</p>
<p>soners. Many persons inclined to lenity, and
</p>
<p>would have had a pardon for young Jerome, main-
</p>
<p>taining that his family had been sufficiently pu-
</p>
<p>nished by the death of the Count, and the loss of
</p>
<p>all their estate. But Andrew Doria, exasperated
</p>
<p>against them, once more overcame the senate's
</p>
<p>clemency, and was the cause of the execution of
</p>
<p>Jerome de Fiesco, Verrina, Calcagno, and Asse-
</p>
<p>reto, and of the bloody arrest against Ottobon,
</p>
<p>forbidding his posterity as far as the fifth genera-
</p>
<p>tion to come near Genoa.
</p>
<p>Let us stop here, and consider exactly what
</p>
<p>happened in the execution of this great design.
</p>
<p>Let us, if it be possible, draw fiom the infinite
</p>
<p>number of faults, which we may observe in it, ex-
</p>
<p>amples of human frailty, and let us own that this
</p>
<p>enterprise, considered in its beginnings as a mas-
</p>
<p>terpiece of courage and conduct amongst men, ap-
</p>
<p>pears in the sequel of it full of the common ef-

<p>drew Doria to abandon the city at the first noise,
</p>
<p>without making the least attempt to appease, by
</p>
<p>his authority, that popular commotion ? * How
</p>
<p>great an infatuation was it in him to neglect the
</p>
<p>advices he received on all hands, of the Count's
</p>
<p>enterprise ? How great an imprudence was it in
</p>
<p>Giannetino to go alone, and in the darkness of the
</p>
<p>night, to St Thomas' Gate, to remedy a disorder
</p>
<p>which he had no reason to despise, being ignorant
</p>
<p>of the cause of it ? How great a coward was Car-
</p>
<p>dinal Doria, not to dare to leave the Senate, and en-
</p>
<p>deavour to retain the people by the respect they
</p>
<p>owed to his dignity ? How imprudent were the
</p>
<p>Senate not to assemble all their forces, at the first
</p>
<p>alarm, to stop at once the progress of the conspi-
</p>
<p>rators in the principal posts of the city, instead
</p>
<p>of sending only weak succours, which could be of
</p>
<p>no considerable service ? And, lastly, what kind
</p>
<p>of conduct was it to endeavour to reclaim by re-
</p>
<p>monstrances a professed rebel, who had arms in
</p>
<p>his hands, and who found himself the strongest ?
</p>
<p>But, after a formal treaty, how pernicious a maxim
</p>
<p>was it in that Senate to violate the public faith,
</p>
<p>and to break a promise so solemnly given to Je-
</p>
<p>rome and Ottobon de Fiesco ? For if the fear of

<p>such usage may be useful to a state, by keeping

<p>him forget that the elder Doria could hardly be prevailed

<p>on to leave the city. There is more reason in his second

<p>question than in his first. It was not shameful in Doria
</p>
<p>to leave Genoa. He was at this time seventy-nine years
</p>
<p>of age, and could have made but a feeble resistance to the

<p>have any thought of revolting, it may also he very
</p>
<p>pernicious to it, hy taking away from those who
</p>
<p>have revolted all hopes of a pardon. And, indeed,
</p>
<p>it is hard to comprehend how those politicians, who
</p>
<p>were reckoned very ahle men, were not afraid, by
</p>
<p>this example, of throwing into despair Jerome de
</p>
<p>Fiesco, who still held the rock of Montobio, which
</p>
<p>he could have put into the hands of foreigners, and
</p>
<p>the loss of which was of the greatest importance
</p>
<p>to the city of Genoa. But if those we have been
</p>
<p>speaking of were guilty of remarkable faults in this
</p>
<p>occasion, we may say that the conspirators commit-
</p>
<p>ted still greater errors after they had lost their chief.
</p>
<p>The Count's valour and good conduct, which were
</p>
<p>in some measure the supreme intelligences which
</p>
<p>governed all the motions of his party, failing by
</p>
<p>his death, that party fell at once into a disorder
</p>
<p>which completed its ruin. Jerome de Fiesco, who,
</p>
<p>on many accounts, was obliged to conceal his
</p>
<p>l)rother's death, was the first that published it,
</p>
<p>and thereby gave his enemies a fresh courage, and
</p>
<p>possessed the minds of his friends with fear. Ot-
</p>
<p>tobon, Verrina, Calcagno, and Sacco, who had
</p>
<p>made their escape in the galley, set at liberty, al-
</p>
<p>most as soon as they had left Genoa, the prisoners
</p>
<p>whom they had in their hands, without foreseeing
</p>
<p>that they might become necessary to them for mak-
</p>
<p>ing their accommodation. Verrina having heard
</p>
<p>of the Count's death, retired in his galley, and
</p>
<p>basely abandoned an afiair of that consequence to
</p>
<p>the conduct of Jerome, who had neither experience
</p>
<p>sufficient, nor authority enough amongst the con-
</p>
<p>spirators, to finish it. That same Jerome made a

<p>tlie point of jjecominp^ a sovereign. He afterwards
</p>
<p>made a shameful capitulation in Montobio upon
</p>
<p>the promise of those who had already broke their
</p>
<p>faitii with him. Verrina, Calcagno, and Sacco,
</p>
<p>the principal actors in this conspiracy, and the most
</p>
<p>criminal of all the Counts accomplices, persuaded
</p>
<p>Jerome to that mean action, upon the hopes that
</p>
<p>were given them of impunity, choosing rather to
</p>
<p>run the hazard of dying by the hands of the exe-
</p>
<p>cutioner, than to fall honourably in the siege.
</p>
<p>Thus ended this great enterprise. Tlius died John
</p>
<p>Lewis de Fiesco, Count de Lavagna, whom some
</p>
<p>honour with the greatest encomiums, others load
</p>
<p>with blame, and many excuse. If we consider the
</p>
<p>maxim which advises us always to respect the exist-
</p>
<p>ing government of the country to wliich we belong,
</p>
<p>without doubt his ambition is criminal. If we re-
</p>
<p>spect his courage and all the great qualities which
</p>
<p>shone forth in the conduct of that action, it appears
</p>
<p>noble and generous. If we regard the power of
</p>
<p>the House of Doria, which gave him just cause to
</p>
<p>apprehend the ruin of the commonwealth and his
</p>
<p>own, it is excusable. But in which way soever we
</p>
<p>speak of it, the most passionate tongues and pens
</p>
<p>cannot disown but that the ill they can say of him
</p>
<p>was common to him with the most illustrious men.
</p>
<p>He was born in a small state, where all private
</p>
<p>conditions were beneath his courage and his merit;
</p>
<p>the natural turbulence of his countrymen, ever
</p>
<p>prone to novelty ; the loftiness of his own mind,
</p>
<p>his youth, his great estate, the number and flatte-
</p>
<p>ries of his friends, the favour of the people, his

<p>being courted by foreign princes, and, lastly, the

<p>cere to inspire with ambition a more moderate
</p>
<p>mind than his. The sequel of liis enterprise was
</p>
<p>one of those accidents which human wisdom can-
</p>
<p>not foresee. Had the success been as happy, as
</p>
<p>the conduct of it was full of prudence and vigour,
</p>
<p>it is to be believed that the sovereignty of Genoa
</p>
<p>had not bounded his courage or his fortune, and
</p>
<p>that those who condemned his memory after his
</p>
<p>death, would have been the loudest in his praise
</p>
<p>whilst he lived. The authors who have blackened
</p>
<p>him with so many calumnies to satisfy the passion
</p>
<p>of the Dorias, and to justify the breach of faith
</p>
<p>of the senate, had by a contrary interest made his
</p>
<p>panegyric, and posterity had counted him amongst
</p>
<p>the heroes of his age. So true it is, that good or
</p>
<p>ill success is commonly the rule of the praise or
</p>
<p>blame given to extraordinary actions. However,
</p>
<p>I think we may say with all the equity required in
</p>
<p>an historian that gives his judgment on the reputa-
</p>
<p>tion of men, that nothing was wanting to that of
</p>
<p>the Count de Fiesco but a longer life, and more
</p>
<p>upright occasions of acquiring glory. *
</p>
<p> The preceding is a narrative of perhaps one of the
</p>
<p>most extraordinary and daring enterprises ever attempted.
</p>
<p>But it is almost impossible to agree with the Cardinal's
</p>
<p>reflections in the concluding passage. He seems to ima-
</p>
<p>gine that HO revolt or conspiracy is treasonable, if it prove
</p>
<p>successful, simply because those who are loudest in its
</p>
<p>condemnation when unsuccessful, would be the first to
</p>
<p>applaud, if its contrivers were otherwise. This is a species
</p>
<p>of reasoning with which no sound-thinking man will a-

<p>Otway's Tragedy of Don Carlos.
</p>
<p>The story of Don Carlos, son of Philip II. of
</p>
<p>Spain, is one of those mysteries which it is difficult
</p>
<p>to unfold. An ohscurity attends it, which pro-
</p>
<p>bably originated with Philip himself, in order to
</p>
<p>restrain any inquiry into the melancholy fate of
</p>
<p>his son ; and hence, this obscurity has afforded a
</p>
<p>theme for numerous romancers, who have execrat-
</p>
<p>ed the conduct of Philip, while setting forth the
</p>
<p>disappointed attachment of Don Carlos and his
</p>
<p>step-mother.
</p>
<p>Our story will be brief. Every one knows the
</p>
<p>remarkable manner in which Charles V, the father
</p>
<p>of Philip II, retired from the world, and resigned
</p>
<p>his vast possessions both in the Old and New World
</p>
<p>to his son. The transition from a throne to the

</p>
<p>gloomy seclusion of the monastic cett, from pos-
</p>
<p>sessing the chief influence in Europe, and main-
</p>
<p>taining a brilliant rivalship with his contempora-
</p>
<p>ries, to that of obscurity, listlessness, and content-
</p>
<p>ment amid the austere rites of the Catholic faith,
</p>
<p>afforded a striking instance of the vanity of hu-
</p>
<p>man gi-eatness, of theii- innumerable cares, and
</p>
<p>harassing intrigues. The schemes of glory and
</p>
<p>ambition which Charles V. buried in his convent,
</p>
<p>he would, indeed, have gladly seen Philip pui*sue ;
</p>
<p>and, notwithstanding his own retirement, and con-
</p>
<p>viction of the burden which he himself had found
</p>
<p>intolerable, the Emperor still wished to secure an
</p>
<p>accession of his own greatness to his son, to urge
</p>
<p>him to the pursuit of glory, and to consolidate his
</p>
<p>widely extended dominions, which he knew well
</p>
<p>conferred rather the appearance of strength than
</p>
<p>the reality.
</p>
<p>When Charles V. abdicated the throne, though
</p>
<p>disappointed in his schemes, his son Philip II. was
</p>
<p>still the most powerful monarch of his age. It
</p>
<p>was, however, before that event, that the character
</p>
<p>of Philip was strikingly contrasted with that of his
</p>
<p>father. At the age of sixteen he married Mary,
</p>
<p>a princess of Portugal, who died two years after-
</p>
<p>xerwards in childbed, after having given birth to
</p>
<p>Don Carlos. Nine years afterwaids, in 1554,
</p>
<p>when he was in the twenty-seventh year of his
</p>
<p>age, he married the Princess Mary of England 
</p>
<p>a marriage which had been negotiated by his fa-
</p>
<p>ther the Emperor ; and Charles himself, it is said,
</p>
<p>if Philip had declined this alliance, had thoughts of
</p>
<p>offering himself to Mary, not wishing to lose such

<p>an opportunity of augmenting his power. But
</p>
<p>Philip was as ambitious as liis father, and ho readi-
</p>
<p>ly consented to marry a princess of thirty-seven,

<p>(fwagreeable in her manners, cruel in her disposi-
</p>
<p>tion, destitute of every female charm, who even
</p>
<p>excelled him in bigotry and zeal for the extirpation
</p>
<p>of heresy.
</p>
<p>With this part of Philip's liistory, as also of his
</p>
<p>fitting out the famous Spanish Armada, and of the
</p>
<p>descent he meditated on Ireland in the reign of
</p>
<p>Elizabeth, every one is familial". Mary died child-
</p>
<p>less, and Don Carlos was as yet the heir of the
</p>
<p>Spanish crown. The early history of the Prince
</p>
<p>is involved in obscurity ; but it is generally agreed
</p>
<p>that he closely resembled Philip himself in many
</p>
<p>particulars. Deformed in his person, his temper
</p>
<p>was violent and irascible ; nor did he ever give any
</p>
<p>remarkable indication that his understanding was
</p>
<p>profound, or that he had any capacity for govern-
</p>
<p>ment. As a proof of his disposition, it is said,
</p>
<p>that on one occasion, as be and his governor, Don
</p>
<p>Garcia de Toledo, who was greatly attached to
</p>
<p>him, were riding togetlier in a retired place, the
</p>
<p>latter having expostulated with him on his con-
</p>
<p>duct, the Prince drew his sword, and would have
</p>
<p>slain Don Garcia, had he not escaped by the swift-
</p>
<p>ness of his horse. Yet he had scarcely arrived at
</p>
<p>the years of manhood, before he evinced the ut-
</p>
<p>most restlessness to be admitted into a share of
</p>
<p>the government, which Philip as steadily opposed,
</p>
<p>either from jealousy, or from a knowledge of his
</p>
<p>incapacity to discharge any important trust. Don
</p>
<p>Carlos was not of a disposition to endure this op-
</p>
<p>position, and the proceedings of his father in va-
</p>
<p>rious matters still farther excited his disgust.

</p>
<p>wanted not a zealous patron in the person of Phi-
</p>
<p>lip II. He established the Inquisition in his do-
</p>
<p>212 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>minions,  a tribunal which he found often of con-
</p>
<p>siderable importance to his affairs, and which, for
</p>
<p>more than two centuries afterwards, scourged that
</p>
<p>kingdom. In the year 1559, on a visit to Valla-
</p>
<p>dolid, he resolved to give a proof of his zeal for
</p>
<p>the Church and his detestation of heresy, by pre-
</p>
<p>siding at an Auto-da-fe. One of these acts had
</p>
<p>been recently performed before his arrival in that
</p>
<p>city, on which occasion a number of Protestants
</p>
<p>had been committed to the flames. There were
</p>
<p>still, however, upwards of thirty remaining in
</p>
<p>the dungeons of the Inquisition, against whom
</p>
<p>the same dreadful sentence had been denounced.
</p>
<p>As Philip, on one occasion, had solemnly dedicat-
</p>
<p>ed his reign to the defence of the Roman faith,
</p>
<p>and the extirpation of heresy, he desired the In-
</p>
<p>quisitors to appoint a day for the execution of
</p>
<p>these unhappy victims, and he resolved to be him-
</p>
<p>self a witness of their agonies. The dreadful
</p>
<p>ceremony was accordingly conducted by the In-
</p>
<p>quisitors with all the pomp and solemnity which
</p>
<p>they could devise ; and Philip, attended by his
</p>
<p>sister, Don Carlos, and a number of the nobles,
</p>
<p>exulted in the atrocious spectacle. After a ser-
</p>
<p>mon had been preached by the Bishop of Zamo-
</p>
<p>ra, he again swore a solemn oath, administered to
</p>
<p>him by the Inquisitor-General, that he would sup-
</p>
<p>port the tribunal, and compel his subjects every
</p>
<p>where to abjure the heresies of Luther. The in-
</p>
<p>human sacrifice then commenced. Among the
</p>
<p>victims was a nobleman named Don Carlos di
</p>
<p>Sessa, who, when conducted to the stake, turned
</p>
<p>his streaming eyes towards the King, and, with

<p>uplifted hands, exclaimed, " Canst thou thus, O
</p>
<p>King, witness the torments of thy subjects ? Save

<p>US from this cruel death, for we deserve it not."
</p>
<p>" No," replied Philip, " I would myself carry
</p>
<p>wood to burn my own son were lie such a wretch
</p>
<p>as thou." And he sat unmoved, and beheld the
</p>
<p>spectacle.
</p>
<p>From such a father, Don Carlos could only
</p>
<p>look for the most summary treatment, if found
</p>
<p>engaged in intrigues. Mutual disgusts had arisen
</p>
<p>between them, accelerated by the violent impetu-
</p>
<p>osity of Don Carlos, and Pliilip behaved towards
</p>
<p>him with distance and reserve. The former was
</p>
<p>mortified still farther, when he beheld the royal con-
</p>
<p>fidence enjoyed by noblemen towards whom he en-
</p>
<p>tertained an unconquerable aversion, partly on that
</p>
<p>account, and partly because he considered them as
</p>
<p>spies set over his conduct. These were the fa-
</p>
<p>mous Ferdinand Alvarez, Duke of Alva, renown-
</p>
<p>ed as a general, but not less famous for his cruel-
</p>
<p>ty, lluy Gomez de Sylva, and Spinoza, President
</p>
<p>of the Council. Towards the former, indeed, Don
</p>
<p>Carlos did not conceal his resentments ; and on
</p>
<p>more than one occasion he had threatened the Duke,
</p>
<p>and even attempted his life, for accepting the go-
</p>
<p>vernment of the Netherlands, to which Don Car-
</p>
<p>los himself aspired.
</p>
<p>But there was another cause sufficient to rouse
</p>
<p>the spirit of Don Carlos, and which probably ex-
</p>
<p>asperated him still more against Alva, as he was
</p>
<p>the person who carried on the negotiation. While
</p>

</p>
<p>Don Carlos himself had contracted, during the
</p>
<p>lifetime of Mary of England, an alliance with
</p>
<p>Elizabeth, daughter of Henry II., the son of Francis
</p>
<p>I. of France ; and, according to some writers, the
</p>
<p>prince had been so far successful as to gain her
</p>
<p>affections. But when Elizabeth of England found
</p>
<p>herself securely seated on her throne, and refused
</p>
<p>the alliance of Philip, which was one cause of his
</p>
<p>unfortunate invasion by the Spanish Armada, the
</p>
<p>King, thougli knowing well the sentiments of his
</p>
<p>son, turned his attention towards France, and
</p>
<p>made overtures to Henry, which were accepted ;
</p>
<p>and Elizabeth became his third queen. She was
</p>
<p>espoused at Paris by the Duke of Alva, in the
</p>
<p>name of his master ; and it was on this occasion
</p>
<p>that the splendour of the ceremony was defeated
</p>
<p>by an event fatal and unexpected. Tilts and tour-
</p>
<p>naments were celebrated on the occasion ; and
</p>
<p>Henry, who was no novice in martial accomplish-
</p>
<p>ments, entered the lists to break a lance with the
</p>
<p>Count de Montgomery, who, at the command of
</p>
<p>his sovereign, complied with great reluctance. The
</p>
<p>first encounter was furious on both sides, and the
</p>
<p>Count's lance having broken against the King's
</p>
<p>helmet, he attacked Henry with the stump. It
</p>
<p>was fatal to the King ; a splinter entered his right
</p>
<p>eye ; the monarch fell to the ground, and was in-
</p>
<p>stantly conveyed to his palace, where he soon ex-
</p>
<p>pired, transmitting Jiis sceptre to the young and
</p>
<p>feeble Francis II., the husband of IMary Queen of
</p>
<p>Scotland.
</p>
<p>Don Carlos, irritated by jealousy, rejoiced at
</p>
<p>this calamity, and at first hoped that a sudden turn

</p>
<p>his motlier Catherine de Medicis, of the House of
</p>
<p>Guise, insisted on the fulfilment of the treaty,
</p>
<p>and the Princess Elizabeth was conducted by the
</p>
<p>King of Navarre to the French frontiers, where
</p>
<p>she was received by the chief of the Spanish nobi-
</p>
<p>lity, and a splendid retinue. She was conducted
</p>
<p>to Toledo, where Philip resided, in which city the
</p>
<p>marriage was celebrated with royal magnificence ;
</p>
<p>and a princess, young, beautiful, and amiable, was
</p>
<p>consigned to the arms of a husband, whose dispo-
</p>
<p>sition, morose, gloomy, and forbidding, had never
</p>
<p>known the tender sentiments of domestic life, and
</p>
<p>who was totally incapable of appreciating her ex-
</p>
<p>cellence.
</p>
<p>Whether there be any truth in the assertion,
</p>
<p>that Elizabeth, having felt an attachment for Don
</p>
<p>Carlos, still retained the recollection of her former
</p>
<p>suitor, which was even heightened by the austerity
</p>
<p>of her husband, it is impossible, from the mystery
</p>
<p>which conceals it, positively to say ; it may be
</p>
<p>truth ; it may be the mere dream of poets and
</p>
<p>romancers : but if it be truth, he must have begun
</p>
<p>early in these adventures, as he was then not much
</p>
<p>more than fourteen years of age. It is agreed,
</p>
<p>however, that this disappointment, and his father's
</p>
<p>displeasure, transported him beyond the bounds of
</p>
<p>prudence ; nor did he attempt to conceal his re-
</p>
<p>sentment. The severe government of Philip gra-
</p>
<p>dually provoked his subjects, who were no less
</p>
<p>afraid of his zeal for exterminating the Protestant
</p>
<p>faith. In no country was this fear more apparent
</p>
<p>than in the Low Countries, or the Netherlands,
</p>
<p>which were then under the Crown of Spain. The

<p>account of their attachment to the reformation of
</p>
<p>religion, and the continuance of foreign troops in
</p>
<p>their provinces. Numerous disturbances arose ;
</p>
<p>and Don Carlos, when in his twenty-first year,
</p>
<p>was intriguing with the malcontents, and was en-
</p>
<p>tertaining a design of withdrawing into Flanders,
</p>
<p>to put himself at their head. The prince had al-
</p>
<p>ready held secret interviews with the Marquis of
</p>
<p>Mons and the Baron de Montigny, two noble-
</p>
<p>men connected with the Low Countries, the object
</p>
<p>of which was that the prince should assume the go-
</p>
<p>vernment. It would appear that Philip knew
</p>
<p>something of these intrigues between his son and
</p>
<p>the malcontents, but he pretended for the present
</p>
<p>to disregard them. Enraged, however, at the
</p>
<p>turbulence of the Low Countries, and exasperat-
</p>
<p>ed against the Prince of Orange, he resolved to
</p>
<p>send against them a man whose disposition to
</p>
<p>cruelty was well known, and who, while he pos-
</p>
<p>sessed the most consummate knowledge of a ge-
</p>
<p>neral, would rule them with a rod of iron.
</p>
<p>The Duke of Alva, the inveterate enemy of
</p>
<p>Don Carlos, was appointed, in 1767, to the go-
</p>
<p>vernment of the Netherlands ; and the conduct of
</p>
<p>the prince on this occasion evidently proves that
</p>
<p>Alva's appointment frustrated all his ill-concerted
</p>
<p>plans. So exasperated he was, that when Alva
</p>
<p>waited upon him to take his leave before his de-
</p>
<p>parture, he drew his dagger, and would proba-
</p>
<p>bly have killed the Duke, had he not been re-
</p>
<p>strained by his attendants, who carried him ont of
</p>
<p>the apartment by force. Alva proceeded to his
</p>
<p>government, and his arrival spread consternation

</p>
<p>wliich rather deserved the epithet which the Fle-
</p>
<p>mings bestowed on it, the Council of Blood. A
</p>
<p>series of atrocities followed, which have few pa-
</p>
<p>rallels in modern history. Some months iiad
</p>
<p>hardly elapsed, when upwards of 1800 persons suf-
</p>
<p>fered by the hands of the executioner ; yet his
</p>
<p>thirst for blood, and his fury towards the Protest-
</p>
<p>ants, were not satisfied. A black catalogue of
</p>
<p>crimes marks Alva's infamous career in the Low
</p>
<p>Countries, and rendered him a fit representative
</p>
<p>of a monarch who could sit unmoved, and behold
</p>
<p>the lamentable spectacle of an Auto-da-Fe.
</p>
<p>The Prince of Orange, against whom the ha-
</p>
<p>tred of Philip was particularly directed, had fore-
</p>
<p>seen the impending storm, and withdrawn into
</p>
<p>Germany. Don Carlos, in the mean while, was
</p>
<p>not idle in the court of Spain ; but unfortunately
</p>
<p>the disaffected in the Low Countries wanted an
</p>
<p>agent of greater ability and penetration. The
</p>
<p>marriage of Elizabeth with his father had made lit-
</p>
<p>tle alteration on his sentiments ; and it is main-
</p>
<p>tained by many writers, that his conduct roused
</p>
<p>the jealousy of Philip. As many of the friends of
</p>
<p>Don Carlos had consulted their safety by a preci-
</p>
<p>pitate flight from the Netherlands into Germany,
</p>
<p>a correspondence was commenced between him
</p>
<p>and the refugees. Nevertheless, as a pretence,
</p>
<p>for whether he was sincere or not is doubtful, he
</p>
<p>became desirous of marrying his cousin, Anne of
</p>
<p>Austria. To this proposal Philip, though he did
</p>
<p>not give it a decided negative, evinced no parti-
</p>
<p>cular anxiety that it should be concluded ; and
</p>
<p>Don Carlos consequently imagined, what indeed

</p>
<p>was extremely probable, that hia father intended
</p>
<p>218 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>to set aside his succession. He now formed the
</p>
<p>design of retreating into Germany ; and for this
</p>
<p>purpose wrote to some of the Spanish nobles to
</p>
<p>aid him in his enterprise.
</p>
<p>The designs, however, of Don Carlos, whatever
</p>
<p>were their nature and importance, were all disco-
</p>
<p>vered to Philip by some persons connected with
</p>
<p>the Court. The projects of this unfortunate
</p>
<p>prince ought to have awakened emotions of pity
</p>
<p>in the bosom of his father ; but to these Philip
</p>
<p>was a stranger. He convened the Inquisitors to-
</p>
<p>gether, who were his chief counsellors, at Madrid ;
</p>
<p>and it was resolved to commence the punishment
</p>
<p>of the Prince, by depriving him, in the first in-
</p>
<p>stance, of his liberty. Don Carlos had, indeed,
</p>
<p>given previous indications of fear, by keeping a
</p>
<p>chest of fire-arms in his apartment, and by sleep-
</p>
<p>ing with loaded pistols under his pillow. He had
</p>
<p>also contrived a lock for his apartment of a pe-
</p>
<p>culiar construction, by which he might be easily
</p>
<p>alarmed if any attempt should be made to surprise
</p>
<p>him. This the King knew, and he was also
</p>
<p>aware, that Don Carlos would not hesitate to de-
</p>
<p>spatch even himself in his own apartment, if he
</p>
<p>had time to grasp his fire-arms. But, attended by
</p>
<p>some of the Inquisitors carrying dark lanterns, he
</p>
<p>effected an entrance into the apartment, while Don
</p>
<p>Carlos was asleep, and rousing him, he ordered
</p>
<p>him instantly into custody, reproaching him for
</p>
<p>his conduct, and telling him that he had come to
</p>
<p>administer parental chastisement. The unfortu-
</p>
<p>tunate prince was then arrayed in a mourning ha-
</p>
<p>bit, though not without great difficulty, for he

<p>frequently attempted to kill himself, and even threw
</p>
<p>IV. THE DEATH OF DON CARLOS. 219
</p>
<p>liimself into the fire of an apartment into which
</p>
<p>he was led.
</p>
<p>For six months after his arrest, Don Carlos was
</p>
<p>kept a close prisoner in the hands of the Inquisi-
</p>
<p>tors. Dming this confinement, he became insane.
</p>
<p>He sometimes fasted for several days, then ate
</p>
<p>voraciously, and attempted to choke himself by
</p>
<p>swallowing unchewed victuals. Many interces-
</p>
<p>sions were made for his release by the principal
</p>
<p>nobility of Spain, but Philip was inexorable. His
</p>
<p>fate is involved in mystery, and there are different
</p>
<p>accounts of his death. Some have maintained,
</p>
<p>that he was strangled, others that he was bled to
</p>
<p>death ; and the friends of Philip have maintained,
</p>
<p>that he died a natural death, about six months
</p>
<p>after his imprisonment, having received his father's
</p>
<p>forgiveness, and the sacrament of the church.
</p>
<p>But it appears undeniable, that a sentence dicta-
</p>
<p>ted by Philip himself, and emanating from the In-
</p>
<p>quisition, terminated the existence of Don Carlos,
</p>
<p>and that he died by the administration of poison
</p>
<p>in the month of February 1568.
</p>
<p>It is doubtful whether the death of Don Carlos
</p>
<p>resulted from his father's rage, on account of his
</p>
<p>turbulence and correspondence with the discon-
</p>
<p>tents of the Low Countries, or his jealousy for the al-
</p>
<p>leged intrigue the prince canied on with the Queen.
</p>
<p>The latter opinion is the favourite theme of ro-
</p>
<p>mance ; but, however much it may have been mag-
</p>
<p>nified, it is not improbable, and it is certain the
</p>
<p>Queen died soon after, not without strong suspi-
</p>
<p>cions of being poisoned. That Don Carlos was
</p>
<p>engaged in a treasonable correspondence, which

<p>might have ripened into a formidable conspiracy,
</p>
<p>there is every reason to believe ; but his tragical
</p>
<p>220 CONSFIRAXJIES.
</p>
<p>fate was more severe than he merttec^l^ as his con-
</p>
<p>duct was not distinguished by that caution and
</p>
<p>prudence which mark the progress of daring and
</p>
<p>dangerous enterprises. Whatever may be the cre-
</p>
<p>dit assigned to his fate at the present time, or
</p>
<p>whatever may be the opinion concerning it, it was
</p>
<p>currently believed in the reign of Philip ; and in
</p>
<p>the Netherlands, in particular, the voice of the
</p>
<p>multitude failed not to impeach him for the stern
</p>
<p>and unnatural sentence. And, after all, tiie hus-
</p>
<p>band of Mary of England, who in a manner sanc-
</p>
<p>tioned the cruelties of her short and inglorious
</p>
<p>reign, the master of the Duke of Alva, who heard
</p>
<p>the recital of that nobleman's atrocities without
</p>
<p>one emotion of pity, or expression of disapproba-
</p>
<p>tion, can have little claim to generosity or clemen-
</p>
<p>cy. His viewing the execution of the Protestants
</p>
<p>by the Inquisition with unconcern, might have been
</p>
<p>ascribed to superstition ; but his cruelty to his son,
</p>
<p>whose conduct, although unjustifiable, he could
</p>
<p>have effectually restrained, by keeping him in du-
</p>
<p>rance, admitted of a different interpretation. " It
</p>
<p>was considered by all the world," observes a writer,
</p>
<p>" as a proof that his heart was dead to the senti-
</p>
<p>ments of natural affection and humanity, and his
</p>
<p>subjects were everywhere filled with astonishment.
</p>
<p>It struck terror, in a paiticular manner, into the
</p>
<p>inhabitants of the Low Countries, who saw how
</p>
<p>vain it was to expect mercy from a prince, who had

<p>so obstinately refused to exercise it towards his

</p>
<p>But, in order to understand rightly the nature
</p>
<p>and objects of tliis Conspiracy, it is necesary to
</p>
<p>go fartlier hack into history, tlian tlie few years
</p>
<p>which it immediately preceded. As it is from the
</p>
<p>assassination of David llizzio in the presence of the
</p>
<p>sovereign, that we are to look for all the subse-
</p>
<p>quent mur(!ers, factions, and conspiracies, which
</p>
<p>before the accession of James VI. to the crown
</p>
<p>of England continually occurred, we may perhaps
</p>
<p>find the origin even of the Gowrie Conspiracy in
</p>
<p>that daring insult to the sovereign. The first who
</p>
<p>stabbed that unfortunate minion, heedless of his
</p>
<p>cries, the expostulations of Mary, and her delicate
</p>
<p>situation, was Lord Ruthven, grandfather of the
</p>
<p>last Earl of Gowrie, who, pale and ghastly,
</p>
<p>scrupled not to rise from a bed of sickness, to
</p>
<p>commit a murder in the private apartment of his
</p>
<p>Queen. After this event, what crimes are not re-
</p>
<p>corded in the Scottish annals ! The murder of
</p>
<p>Damley; the deep-laid schemes and hypocrisy of
</p>
<p>the Earl of Murray; the dark intrigues and factious
</p>
<p>cabals of his minions and associates ; the expulsion
</p>
<p>of Mary from the throne ; Murray's assassination,
</p>
<p>the death of the Earl of Mar, Kirkaldy of the
</p>
<p>Grange, Maitland of Lethington, and the Earl of
</p>
<p>Morton, not to mention others of lesser note, and
</p>
<p>other circumstances,  all characterize the age as
</p>
<p>one of turbulence, crime, and sedition. Add to
</p>
<p>these the religious disputes which succeeded the
</p>
<p>Reformation ; the conduct of the Presbyterian
</p>
<p>ministers ; their arrogance, and their high preten-
</p>
<p>sions ; their being invariably found connected with
</p>
<p>almost every faction ; their seditious sermons,

</p>
<p>which tliey assumed, and I venture to say, that
</p>
<p>the annals of few countries present such a dark
</p>
<p>catalogue of crimes, treason, and sedition, as those
</p>
<p>of this, at that time poor, and comparatively insig-
</p>
<p>nificant, northern kingdom.
</p>
<p>At the period when James VI. assumed tle
</p>
<p>reins of government, which was in 1580, Scotland
</p>
<p>was harassed hy various parties whose turbulence
</p>
<p>originated under the pretence of religion. The
</p>
<p>three parties into which the nation was soon di-
</p>
<p>vided, were the Roman Catholics, whose esta-
</p>
<p>blishment had been overthrown by the reformers
</p>
<p>with more zeal than knowledge, inasmuch as it
</p>
<p>was accompanied by uncalled for ebullitions of
</p>
<p>fury and devastation ; the Protestant Episcopal
</p>
<p>Church, which the King washed to establish in the
</p>
<p>room of the ancient ecclesiastics ; and the Presby-
</p>
<p>terian preachers, whose theology and notions on
</p>
<p>church-government were imported from the school
</p>
<p>of Geneva, and who had established themselves.
</p>
<p>The first party prevailed greatly in the northern
</p>
<p>counties, under the especial influence of the Eaii
</p>
<p>of Huntly, and other powerful cliiefs ; the second
</p>
<p>prevailed also in the north, and to a limited ex-
</p>
<p>tent, among the inhabitants of the Lowland coun-
</p>
<p>ties, being supported by the court, a considerable
</p>
<p>number of the nobles, the landholders or lairds, and
</p>
<p>many of the well informed of the middle classes ; the
</p>
<p>third, and the most numerous, was supported almost
</p>
<p>exclusively by the inferior and lowest ranks, aided
</p>
<p>by a few of the nobles, some of whom adhered to it
</p>

</p>
<p>annihilated their hopes, and ended the associa-
</p>
<p>tion. The Protestant Church, on the other hand,
</p>
<p>being sanctioned by the State, having no occasion
</p>
<p>to be turbulent, existed peaceably, through much
</p>
<p>suffering and insult from the third party, the Pres-
</p>
<p>byterian preachers, headed by Andrew Melville,
</p>
<p>who, animated with the most inveterate liatred to
</p>
<p>whatever savoured not of the Calvinistic polity,
</p>
<p>as if truth had taken up her abode nowhere else
</p>
<p>but in a single city of Switzerland, thundered their
</p>
<p>anathemas from the pulpit against the King, the
</p>
<p>court, and all those who favoured not their party;
</p>
<p>as if real religion was to be found only among
</p>
<p>them, and nothing but heathenism among their op-
</p>
<p>ponents, alarming the people by fierce declama-
</p>

</p>
<p>a most formidable faction. The bold pretensions
</p>
<p>of the ministers, who, being in possession of the
</p>
<p>pulpits, had excellent opportunities for inculcating
</p>
<p>their favourite opinions, which they hardly if ever
</p>
<p>failed to improve, and the influence which they
</p>
<p>contrived to establish over the people, were ad-
</p>
<p>mirable auxiliaries in the hands of a party whose
</p>
<p>safety depended on popular clamour. As tlie Pres-
</p>
<p>byterian ministers had been always the mortal ene-
</p>
<p>mies of Mary, whose very religion was crime
</p>
<p>enough in their eyes, the assassination of David
</p>
<p>Rizzio, or " Siguior Davie, " as they termed him,
</p>
<p>was applauded by them as a noble act;* and they
</p>
<p>scrupled not to give countenance to the malicious
</p>
<p>report, which is unblushingly maintained by one
</p>
<p>of their great champions, Buchanan, and darkly
</p>
<p>* That John Knox was privy to this assassination can
</p>
<p>hardly be doubted. When James VI,, on one occasion,
</p>
<p>censured Knox's memory for approving of that atrocious
</p>
<p>act, a minister replied, " that the slaughter of David,
</p>
<p>so far as it was the work of God, was allowed by Mr
</p>
<p>Knox, and not otherwise. " Calderwood MS., quoted
</p>
<p>by Dr M'Crie, Life of Knox, p. 309. We need not be
</p>
<p>surprised at this, for Knox had previously exulted in the
</p>
<p>rriurder of Cardinal Beaton, and actually sanctioned
</p>
<p>it, by afterwards joining the murderers. With respect
</p>
<p>to Itizzio's murder, which no sound-thinking person can
</p>
<p>ever justify, and Knox's share in it, I presume the reader
</p>
<p>will peruse the following set-oft" by Dr M'Crie with
</p>

<p>himself into the favour of James after he assumed

<p>James for favourites had been early manifested,
</p>
<p>and at this period he liad two, vvlio mortally hated
</p>
<p>each other, Esme Stuart, Duke of Lennox, and
</p>
<p>cousin-germ an of James' father, and .James Stew-
</p>
<p>art, Earl of Arran, who, by a series of intrigues,
</p>
<p>and even crimes, had been elevated to that dig-
</p>
<p>nity at the expense of the House of Hamilton,
</p>
<p>which had been by him unjustly deprived of that
</p>
<p>earldom. The former, who has been most de-
</p>
<p>servedly described by Dr Robertson as gentle, hu-
</p>
<p>mane, and candid, * the only amiable favourite
</p>
<p>whom James ever adopted, was eventually driven
</p>
<p>from Scotland by a faction who pretended to be-
</p>
<p>lieve him a Papist and an emissary of Rome ; the
</p>
<p>latter is described as being of " a prowd and ar-
</p>
<p>rogant mynd, and thoght na man to be his equal."
</p>
<p>The disputes between those two noblemen, at first
</p>
<p>resulting from private jealousy, became at length
</p>
<p>public, and were productive of innumerable feuds.
</p>
<p>While Lennox was supported by the court party,
</p>
<p>Arran contrived to interest the Presbyterian mi-
</p>
<p>nisters in liis quarrel, by affecting an outrageous
</p>
<p>zeal against Popery, and by opposing the King's
</p>
<p>measures with regard to the government of the
</p>
<p>church, to which they had an invincible hatred.

<p>from two causes ; the private quarrel of Lennox
</p>
<p>and Arran, and the intrigues of the ministers. A
</p>
<p>circumstance, illustrative of the latter, occuired at
</p>
<p>this time, which induced the ministers more readily
</p>
<p>to co-operate in exciting a popular ferment. After
</p>
<p>the death of John Douglas, the first Protestant
</p>
<p>Archbishop of St Andrew's, Patrick Adamson, a
</p>
<p>scholar and a pcet, had been appointed to the pri-
</p>
<p>macy. As he would not submit to the General
</p>
<p>Assembly, lie was most violently denounced by
</p>
<p>Andrew Melville, and almost all the ministers.
</p>
<p>The clamour which they excited, however, and
</p>
<p>the fear of the excommunication they threatened,
</p>
<p>induced Adamson to tender them a kind of sub-
</p>
<p>mission not very consonant to his dignity. But
</p>
<p>this did not satisfy them. They summoned him
</p>
<p>before them, industriously propagated a report,
</p>
<p>that he had consulted the devil for the recovery of
</p>
<p>his health ; and were the means of procuring an old
</p>
<p>woman, named Alison Pearson, to be imprisoned,
</p>
<p>and afterwai'ds burnt as a witch, for recommending
</p>
<p>to the Archbishop some simple medicines, not of
</p>
<p>the most palatable kind, in his illness. *
</p>
<p> This fact is narrated with great gravity by Calder-
</p>
<p>vvood, (p. 14-0.) It appears from his account, that Alison
</p>
<p>Pearson made Iier escape from prison, by the aid of the
</p>
<p>Archbishop ; but such were the tender mercies of the
</p>
<p>** Presbiterie, " that she was apprehended four years after-

</p>
<p>duct of the ministers of Edinburgh being' imitated
</p>
<p>by the inferior grade in the country parishes, they
</p>
<p>were found to be most important auxiliaries in
</p>
<p>Arran's practices. Tiiere was, however, another
</p>
<p>case somewhat similar to Archbishop Adamson's,
</p>
<p>in which Lennox was more immediately con-
</p>
<p>cerned, and which fomented the popular outcry
</p>
<p>against him. The See of Glasgow had been va-
</p>
<p>cant since the flight of Archbishop James Beaton
</p>
<p>to Paris, who had refused to accede to tlie Re-
</p>
<p>formation. Lennox's friends conceived, that if an
</p>
<p>Archbishop were to be appointed in the Duke's
</p>
<p>interest, it would be a good opportunity for him
</p>
<p>to obtain an influence in that city, as Glasgow was
</p>
<p>dependent on the Archbishop, he being ex officio
</p>
<p>lord of the regality. Accordingly, Robert Mont-
</p>
<p>gomery was induced to accept it, in a manner
</p>
<p>not very lionourable either to his patron or him-
</p>
<p>self. He promised to cede to Lennox all the
</p>
<p>lands and revenues belonging to the See, and to
</p>
<p>content himself with 500/. Scots (about 70/. Ster-
</p>
<p>ling), and some trifling immunities, f Montgo-
</p>
<p>mery, unfortunately for himself, had formerly been
</p>
<p>a keen opponent of Episcopacy ; and as his con-
</p>
<p>duct was viewed by his quondam friends as a
</p>
<p>flagrant apostasy, they proceeded more rigorous-
</p>
<p>ly against him than against Adamson. It is a

<p>have terminated very differently. But, on the
</p>
<p>contrary, they drew up a sort of very modest
</p>
<p>charge against the Archbishop, to the following
</p>
<p>effect,  that he had maintained, in a sermon at
</p>
<p>Stirling, that women were circumcised in the fore-

<p>however, tliat this eubmission had displeased the
</p>
<p>King, he retracted it, and proceeded to Glasgow
</p>
<p>to take possession of the See. On the 8th of
</p>
<p>March 1582, the Archhisliop entered tlie cathe-
</p>
<p>dral, and seeing a minister in the pulpit, he order-
</p>
<p>ed him out. Tiie preacher replied, that he was
</p>
<p>placed there by the Kirk, and refused to come
</p>
<p>down ; whereupon he was forcibly ejected, and
</p>
<p>even buffeted by the followers of the Laird of
</p>
<p>Minto. Another minister named Howison, who
</p>
<p>pretended to be moderator of the Presbytery, was
</p>
<p>imprisoned by the Provost of Glasgow, being for-

<p>speecnes which he was holding forth.

<p>The ministers and their adherents were now

</p>
<p>prelate's excommunication, as also the penalties

<p>wliich those incurred who kept company with ex-

</p>
<p>whether the King or they were to be superiors ;
</p>
<p>and also gave them to understand, that the Arch-
</p>
<p>bishop was entertained by him at the King's com-

<p>mand, and lie would continue to do so wliiie he
</p>
<p>pleased, in defiance of their censures. The King
</p>
<p>had also declared the excommunication illegal; and
</p>
<p>a list of grievances was agreed upon by the minis-
</p>
<p>ters, which they resolved to present to James him-

<p>self in September 1582.
</p>
<p>But various proceedings in the interval, which

<p>fall now to be recorded, materially altered the as-

<p>pect of affairs. Arran, Lennox's mortal enemy,

<p>observed with exultation that James was intimi-

<p>dated by this opposition ; and he resolved not to
</p>
<p>lose the opportunity to rid himself and his own asso-
</p>
<p>ciates of a rival. Being sure of the support of the
</p>
<p>ministers, who were ready to engage in any conspi-
</p>
<p>racy agiiinst their sovereign and the Duke, Arran
</p>
<p>pretended great subn)ission to James, and offered

<p>to resign his office as Captain of the Guard, which,
</p>
<p>being accepted, was, to his infinite mortification,

<p>bestowed on Lennox. He then craved permission

<p>to retire from court, which was also granted ; with

<p>the stipulation, however, that he should fix his re-
</p>
<p>sidence in the metropolis.

<p>this pretended compliance was merely a covert to

<p>their designs. A powerful confederacy was form-

<p>ed, which had for its pretended object, the defence
</p>
<p>of the religion and the liberties of the kingdom,
</p>
<p>but, in reality, to procure the ruin of Lennox, and
</p>
<p>possession of the King's person. This confederacy
</p>
<p>was not managed with so great caution, as to pre-
</p>
<p>clude it from reaching the ears of the Duke ; but
</p>
<p>an apparent reconciliation, which was eff'cted be-
</p>
<p>tween him and Arran, tended to throsv him oft" his
</p>
<p>guard, while the confederacy in secret was equally
</p>
<p>opposed to Arran, whose ruin was also meditated
</p>
<p>by some of its members, after they had accom-
</p>
<p>plished that of Lennox. The liunting-season was
</p>
<p>advancing, when James prepared himself to parti-
</p>
<p>cipate in a sport of which he was passionately
</p>
<p>font!. For this purpose, he proceeded to Athol,
</p>
<p>leaving his two rival favourites at their respective
</p>
<p>residences ; Lennox at Dalkeith, in Mid-Lothian,
</p>
<p>and Arran at Kinneil, near Borrowstounness, in
</p>
<p>Linlithgowshire ; and accompanied only by two
</p>
<p>noblemen, the Earls of Athol and Gowrie. The
</p>
<p>district of Athol at that period possessed peculiar
</p>
<p>attractions to those devoted to the pastimes of the
</p>
<p>chase; and the numerous clansmen of the chief
</p>
<p>frequently graced the retinue of the Scottish sove-
</p>
<p>reigns, when they visited those sequestered dis-
</p>
<p>tricts. Thither the young monarch proceeded, to
</p>
<p>forget for a while the feuds of his factious and tur-
</p>
<p>bulent subjects.
</p>
<p>It was at this season that the confederates re-
</p>
<p>solved to commence their operations against both

<p>the favourites of the King. The inclinations of

</p>
<p>among the rabble. The popular party was at this
</p>
<p>time engaged in a treavsonahle correspondence with
</p>
<p>Elizabeth, and it was soon industriously circulat-
</p>
<p>ed by them that Lennox was a Papist, and in
</p>
<p>league with the Duke of Guise, simply because
</p>
<p>he happened to be a Frenchman by birth. In the
</p>
<p>execution of his office, moreover, ,as Lord Cham-
</p>
<p>berlain, an office which had been suffered to fall
</p>
<p>into desuetude, he found the proprietors of lands
</p>
<p>strongly disposed to dispute their feudal tenures,
</p>
<p>which made him exact the duties with the utmost
</p>
<p>rigour ; and thus, though he did no more than he
</p>
<p>was warranted by law, he raised up against him-
</p>
<p>self a number of enemies. The boroughs were also
</p>
<p>under the jurisdiction of the chamberlain, and the
</p>
<p>proceedings of Lennox were by no means popular
</p>
<p>with those who managed their affairs, inasmuch as
</p>
<p>he had resolved to revive that jurisdiction, which
</p>
<p>the carelessness of his predecessors had caused
</p>
<p>them to neglect.
</p>
<p>But, however much Lennox erred in his pub-
</p>
<p>lic proceedings, and however falsely he was slan-
</p>
<p>dered by a faction who affected to believe him
</p>
<p>a Papist, and in the interest of the unfortunate
</p>
<p>Mary, his errors were those of the head, not of
</p>
<p>the heart, as being a man too easily counselled by
</p>
<p>ambitious and designing adventurers. It was not
</p>
<p>so with the Earl of Arran, whose infamy the page
</p>
<p>of history has faithfully recorded. This nobleman
</p>
<p>was Captain James Stewart, son of Lord Ochiltree,
</p>
<p>who, in 1581, had accused and brought to the
</p>
<p>block the Regent Morton, as being concerned in
</p>
<p>the murder of Dainley. Having thus commenced

<p>liis career in blood, it was not to be expected that

</p>
<p>he would be too scrupulous as to principle. With
</p>
<p>jjieat dexterity he procured the guardianship of the
</p>
<p>young Earl of Arran, who, from repeated mortifi-
</p>
<p>cations and disappointments, had become deranged.
</p>
<p>No sooner had Stewart obtained possession of that
</p>
<p>young nobleman, at one time beloved by the Re-
</p>
<p>iformers, than he seized his estates, assumed his
</p>
<p>title, and kept his ward in custody, where he was
</p>
<p>treated with barbarous cruelty. Being as cunning
</p>
<p>as he was unprincipled, he had the address to in-
</p>
<p>sinuate himself into the favour of the King, whose
</p>
<p>juvenile passions he flattered and humoured, and
</p>
<p>whose mind he endeavoured to poison by de-
</p>
<p>bauchery and dissipation. While he was enter-
</p>
<p>tained at the house of the Earl of March, the
</p>
<p>King's grand-uncle, he scrupled not, in open de-
</p>
<p>fiance of the laws of honour, gratitude, and hos-
</p>
<p>pitality, to seduce the wife of his benefactor, a la-
</p>
<p>dy young and beautiful, but of the most violent
</p>
<p>and profligate passions. Impatient of restraint in
</p>
<p>their guilty connection, and wishing to legitimatise
</p>
<p>the offspring of their adulterous commerce, the la-
</p>
<p>dy, by the advice of Arran, petitioned to be di-
</p>
<p>vorced from her husband on grounds which no
</p>
<p>modest woman would ever plead in a court of jus-
</p>
<p>tice. By the influence of Arran she was success-
</p>
<p>ful ;  a sentence of divorce was passed, which was
</p>
<p>instantly followed by marriage with her paramour.
</p>
<p>Nay, so utterly unprincipled was this man, that
</p>
<p>when the King, then only sixteen years of age,
</p>
<p>was at his seat of Kinneil, he carried his sister in
</p>
<p>his arms by force, and undressed, into the King's
</p>
<p>apartment, and told his sovereign to use her in the

</p>
<p>who affected to regard the Protestant religion iu

</p>
<p>hesitated not at times to act, in their zeal to esta-
</p>
<p>blish their favourite system of church- go vern-
</p>
<p>merit.
</p>
<p>But Arran, as well as Lennox, was viewed with
</p>
<p>hatred by the confederacy, though not with the
</p>
<p>same feelings, inasmuch as the French connections
</p>
<p>of the latter operated powerfully against him. The
</p>
<p>confederacy, as has been observed at the outset,
</p>
<p>consisted of the Earls of Gowrie, Mar, Glencairn,
</p>
<p>Athol, and Rothes, Lords Lindsay, Boyd, Oliphant,
</p>
<p>the Master of Glammis, the Lairds of Lochleven,
</p>
<p>Cleish, Easter Wemyss, with several other barons
</p>
<p>and gentlemen of distinction. The King proceeded
</p>
<p>to Athol ; and, after having enjoyed his pastime,
</p>
<p>prepared to return to the metropolis with a small
</p>
<p>number of attendants. He accordingly left the forest
</p>
<p>of Athol, and, on the 22d of August 1582, was pro-
</p>
<p>ceeding on his journey southwards, when he was in-
</p>
<p>vited by Govv'rie to Rutbven Castle, which lay iu
</p>
<p>his way. * James accepted the invitation, little
</p>
<p>conceiving that there was any design against him,
</p>
<p>though, when he entered the Castle, he felt some
</p>
<p>uneasiness at the multitude of strangers. This
</p>
<p>alarm, however, he thought it prudent to conceal,
</p>
<p>although he had sufficient grounds for alarm, as his
</p>
<p>own attendants were few, and as the retainers of

<p>the confederated nobles were armed, to the num-
</p>

<p>out the npighbourhood. Durin? the night, no in-
</p>
<p>dication of violence appenred ; but on the, follow-
</p>
<p>ing morning, when the King summoned his at-
</p>
<p>tendants, and was about to leave the apartment,
</p>
<p>the Master of Glamrais appeared at the door, and
</p>
<p>told him that he must stay. Thougli the King's
</p>
<p>fears had now increased, he nevertheless appeared
</p>
<p>to be at ease, and inquired at the Master the rea-
</p>
<p>son of his interruption. He was told in reply that
</p>
<p>he would know it soon. The associated Lords then
</p>
<p>appeared, and presented a remonstance against
</p>
<p>Lennox and Arran, which James received with
</p>
<p>the complaisance necessary in his situation. Still
</p>
<p>he was impatient to be gone, and made an effort
</p>
<p>to leave the room, but was rudely prevented.
</p>
<p>Finding himself a prisoner, he expostulated, en-
</p>
<p>treated, and threatened ; and at last, finding no
</p>
<p>chance of escape, he burst into tears. The Mas-
</p>
<p>ter of Glammis, however, fiercely exclaimed to his
</p>
<p>companions, " No matter for his tears : better
</p>
<p>children weep than bearded men. " This ex-
</p>
<p>clamation made an impression on James, which
</p>
<p>lie never afterwards forgot or forgave. They
</p>
<p>immediately placed the King under severe re-
</p>
<p>straint ; dismissed all liis followers, whom they
</p>
<p>impeached, and allowed no one to have access to
</p>
<p>him but those of their own party.
</p>
<p>This exploit was soon noised abroad ; and on
</p>
<p>the following day, Arran and his brother set out
</p>
<p>for lluthven witli about forty horsemen, to escort
</p>
<p>the King to Edinburgh. He depended much on

<p>DupUn, where he separated from his followers,
</p>
<p>and with two attendants proceeded to the Castle
</p>
<p>of Ruthven, charging his brother to keep the high-
</p>
<p>way with the rest. Arran arrived at the gate, and
</p>
<p>demanded admission to the King ; but the wrath
</p>
<p>of the conspirators arose to such a pitch, at the
</p>
<p>sight of a man who was now odious, that instant
</p>
<p>death would have been the penalty of his rashness,
</p>
<p>had not the friendship of Gowrie intervened. He
</p>
<p>was sent a prisoner to Stirling Castle. His fol-
</p>
<p>lowers, under the command of his brother, were
</p>
<p>attacked by the Earl of Mar with a superior force.
</p>
<p>They were soon routed ; his brother was taken
</p>
<p>prisoner, severely wounded, and sent to the Cas-
</p>
<p>tle of Duplin.
</p>
<p>For six days the King was kept in close con-
</p>
<p>finement, but treated, nevertheless, with respect.
</p>
<p>Lennox, in the mean time, was not idle. He des-
</p>
<p>patched some noblemen in his interest to inquire
</p>
<p>into the condition of the King, and to ascertain
</p>
<p>whether or not he was detained against his will ;
</p>
<p>for if so, as was strongly rumoured, he would en-
</p>
<p>deavour to set him free. They were not permit-
</p>
<p>ted, however, to see the King, except in presence
</p>
<p>of the associated nobles ; and when they had ex-
</p>
<p>pressed their opinions, James immediately exclaim-
</p>
<p>ed that he was a prisoner, which he desired them
</p>
<p>to proclaim to all his subjects, hoping that the
</p>
<p>Duke would exert himself to effect his rescue.
</p>
<p>The ringleaders denied that he was a captive , and
</p>
<p>after expressing an invective against both Lennox
</p>
<p>and Arran, declared to the noblemen sent by the
</p>

<p>and with this declaration, thoy forcibly ejected the
</p>
<p>messengers of Lennox from tlie Castle.
</p>
<p>When the news of this exploit readied the me-
</p>
<p>tropolis, nothing could exceed the consternation of
</p>
<p>the public mind. In Edinburgh the influence of
</p>
<p>Lennox was considerable, and he made himself
</p>
<p>particularly active by Ids endeavours to excite tlie
</p>
<p>citizens. The conspirators, however, the day after
</p>
<p>his captivity, suffered James to proceed to Perth,
</p>
<p>in order to preserve appearances, hut vigilantly
</p>
<p>guarded by their own associates. James now
</p>
<p>found it necessary to yield to circumstances. Tiie
</p>
<p>remonstrance which the ringleaders had presented,
</p>
<p>abounded with the most furious invectives against
</p>
<p>the two ftivourites, the Archbishop of Glasgow,
</p>
<p>the Bishop of Ross, and various others who were
</p>
<p>attached to the unfortunate Mary. Thus situated,
</p>
<p>and more apprehensive for the safety of Lennox
</p>
<p>than for liis own, he agreed to issue an extorted
</p>
<p>proclamation, setting forth, that his residence at
</p>
<p>Perth was his own fiee choice, and commanding
</p>
<p>all associations which had been formed for his res-
</p>
<p>cue to dissolve within six hours from tlie date of
</p>
<p>the proclamation, under the penalties of treason.
</p>
<p>This proclamation bore date the 28th of August, the
</p>
<p>eighth day after the capture of the King. Lennox
</p>
<p>was by this time at tlie iiead of a considerable force ;
</p>
<p>and we are also informed by Sir James 13alfour,
</p>
<p>that another association was formed to liberate the
</p>
<p>King, consisting of the Earls of Iluntly, Crawford,
</p>
<p>Argyle, Montrose, Marischall, Sutherland, and

<p>ther or not those noblemen coalesced with Lennox,
</p>
<p>it is impossible to say ; but it is probable that he
</p>
<p>would have paid little attention to the proclama-
</p>
<p>tion, as he knew that the King was a prisoner,
</p>
<p>and that it had been extorted from him by force,
</p>
<p>had he not received a private letter from the King,
</p>
<p>exhorting him to leave the kingdom before the
</p>
<p>20th of September. This letter he communicated
</p>
<p>to his friends, who advised him in the mean time
</p>
<p>to retire to Dunbarton, where they would after-
</p>
<p>wards deliberate whether he should depart for
</p>
<p>France, or attempt the rescue of the King. At
</p>
<p>Dunbarton, however, so many noblemen and othei-s
</p>
<p>espoused his cause, that the confederates took the
</p>
<p>alarm, and procured an order from James, com-
</p>
<p>manding all the Duke's attendants, with the ex-
</p>
<p>ception of forty, to depart from Dunbarton within
</p>
<p>twelve hours after notice, and to desist from ap-
</p>
<p>proaching the Duke's residence while he was in
</p>
<p>Scotland. Lennox lost all hope after this intima-
</p>
<p>tion, and sent Lord Herries with two gentlemen
</p>
<p>to demand assurance of his own safety, if he com-
</p>
<p>plied with that order. After mature deliberation,
</p>
<p>his enemies sent him a peremptory order ; * and
</p>
<p>while Lennox was considering it, AiTan was exa-
</p>
<p>mined in prison, but the result was not made
</p>
<p>known. George Douglas, also, the same who had
</p>
<p>aided Mary in her escape from Lochleven, was
</p>
<p>arrested at Stirling, and examined concerning the
</p>
<p>intended plot to associate Mary with the King in
</p>
<p>the government. He confessed that he had heard
</p>
<p>the report, but denied that he had concern in it,
</p>
<p>nor could he inform them who were its contrivers.

<p>Gowrie and the noblemen who detained the
</p>
<p>King began to diacover, that all their pretended
</p>
<p>representations about the public good had no effect
</p>
<p>in quieting the uneasiness of the people. He was
</p>
<p>accordingly brought to Edinburgh ; and his recep-
</p>
<p>tion, on entering the city, was highly characteristic
</p>
<p>and picturesque. James was met by the Presbyterian
</p>
<p>ministers, who formed part of the procession, and
</p>
<p>proceeded along the streets, singing the 124th Psalm,
</p>
<p>beginning, " Now Israel may say, " &c. * A con-
</p>
<p>vention of the Estates was called, which of course
</p>
<p>consisted solely of the associated peers. The
</p>
<p>ministers loudly extolled the detention of the King ;
</p>
<p>they passed an act of their assembly, declaring the
</p>
<p>conspirators " to have done good and acceptable
</p>
<p>service to God ; " and threatening those with ex-
</p>
<p>communication who opposed the good cause. The
</p>
<p>act of their assembly they caused to be read in
</p>
<p>all the churches of the kingdom, " to the offence, "
</p>
<p>observes Spottiswoode, " of many good men, who
</p>
<p>were grieved to see a bad cause thus coloured and
</p>
<p>defended. "
</p>
<p>The plans of the conspirators were successful with
</p>
<p>regard to Lennox. Arran was set at liberty, and
</p>
<p>compelled to reside northward of the river Spey, but
</p>
<p>Lennox was commanded to leave the kingdom. As
</p>
<p>to the Duke, he continued to lurk about Blackness,
</p>
<p>Dunbarton, Callender, and other places, where he
</p>
<p>could find shelter, still hoping that circumstances
</p>
<p>might occur which would cause an alteration in his
</p>
<p>affairs. But the hatred of his enemies was impla-
</p>
<p>cable. Though often destitute of the common
</p>
<p>necessaries of life, and even of clothing, he was

<p>reluctant to depart from the kingdom without tak-
</p>
<p>ing leave of his sovereign. This was denied him ;
</p>
<p>and he at length departed for France, where he
</p>
<p>(lied on the 2yth of May the following year, of a
</p>
<p>broken lieart, as was reported, but not without
</p>
<p>strong suspicions of being poisoned. James la-
</p>
<p>mented his deatli sincerely, and ever afterwards
</p>
<p>showed kindness to his children. A few hours
</p>
<p>before his death, which happened at Paris, some
</p>
<p>priests came to him to administer the last rites of
</p>
<p>the Romish Church, but he v/ould not admit them,
</p>
<p>and declared that he would die in the faith of the
</p>
<p>Church of Scotland. This fact was publicly made
</p>
<p>known by James, that the people might see the
</p>
<p>injury he had sustained by his enemies during hia
</p>
<p>residence in Scotland.
</p>
<p>An ambassador, in tlie meantime, from Eliza-
</p>
<p>beth, at whose instance, indeed, the whole busi-
</p>
<p>ness bad been conducted, procured the recall of
</p>
<p>the Earl of Angus, who had been exiled for his
</p>
<p>turbulence, and forfeited in the Parliament of 1581.
</p>
<p>In the beginning of December, Arran so far set at
</p>
<p>nought liis restraint as to have a meeting with the
</p>
<p>Earls of Crawford, Athol, and Montrose, after
</p>
<p>which the Court was daily distracted by rumours
</p>
<p>of conspiracies and intended assassinations. The
</p>
<p>King was still as much a prisoner as he had been
</p>
<p>when in the Castle of Rutliven ; and he was doom-
</p>
<p>ed to repeated mortifications and insults from the
</p>
<p>ministers and their adherents. Two ambassa-

</p>
<p>Their sermons abounded with declamations against

</p>
<p>them : they were termed ambassadors of the hloody
</p>
<p>murderer, meaning the Duke of Guise, who, they
</p>
<p>maintained, had caused them to he sent hitlier.
</p>
<p>One of them happened to be a knight of the Holy
</p>
<p>(ihost; and, consequently, the white cross of the
</p>
<p>order which he wore was pronounced to be the
</p>
<p>badge of Antichrist. The ambassadors pitied a
</p>
<p>monarch whose life was embittered by those men ;
</p>
<p>and seeing all hope of a negotiation vain, they
</p>
<p>petitioned for their dismissal, to return to France.
</p>
<p>This was granted ; but the King, wishing to treat
</p>
<p>them with some respect, on account of the alli-
</p>
<p>ance which had formerly existed between France
</p>
<p>and Scotland, made arrangements with the magis-
</p>
<p>trates of Edinburgh to give them an entertain-
</p>
<p>ment before their departure. This also gave of-
</p>
<p>fence to the ministers ; and, in order to frustrate it,
</p>
<p>they proclaimed a solemn fast to be held on the
</p>
<p>very day of the festival. On that day, in ordec
</p>
<p>to detain the people in the church, three of them
</p>
<p>successively preached sermons in St Giles' Church,
</p>
<p>the object of which was to excite the rabble to fall
</p>
<p>on the ambassadors ; and their curses were more
</p>
<p>than ordinarily vehement against the magistrates
</p>
<p>and the nobility who waited on the foreigners.
</p>
<p>Nor was this all; it was with the utmost difficulty
</p>
<p>that the ministers, after the ambassadors had de-
</p>
<p>parted, were restrained from excommunicating the
</p>
<p>magistrates for not observing their fast, which,
</p>
<p>from the motives by which it was proclaimed, was
</p>
<p>in reality an insult to Heaven, and treason against
</p>
<p>the King, they having no authority to institute any
</p>
<p>such observances.

<p>The King was obliged to submit to these and

<p>innumerable other insults in silence, and thus the

</p>
<p>faction soon became emboldened to take greater
</p>
<p>liberties witb tlie royal power. They scrupled
</p>
<p>not to J^et aside acts of Parliament which did not
</p>
<p>coincide with their wishes ; and they actually en-
</p>
<p>acted laws in their illegal assemblies, which being,
</p>
<p>as they pretended, enacted in the name, and by
</p>
<p>the authority of Christ, the head of the Cburcli,
</p>
<p>were not only binding on all the estates of the
</p>
<p>kingdom, but were to l3e implicitly obeyed under
</p>
<p>the penalty of excommunication. But James was
</p>
<p>determined to endure the bondage no longer than
</p>
<p>was necessary ; and various circumstances occur-
</p>
<p>red which induced him to watch for a sufficient
</p>
<p>opportunity. The principal object of alarm with
</p>
<p>the associated Lords, was the fear that negocia-
</p>
<p>tions would yet be concluded to secure the crown
</p>
<p>to Marj'^ in conjunction with the King. Yet,
</p>
<p>though they guarded James most sedulously night
</p>
<p>and day, they could not prevent the access of cer-
</p>
<p>tain noblemeu to the King, who hated the associa-
</p>
<p>tion, and to whom James spoke without reserve,
</p>
<p>informing them that he was resolved to hazard
</p>
<p>every thing to recover his fieedom. The return
</p>
<p>of two ambassadors from England, the one mak-
</p>
<p>ing a report different from the other, made James
</p>
<p>more anxious than ever to obtain his deliverance.
</p>
<p>As the confederated Lords were in league with
</p>
<p>Elizabeth, whom they secretly assured, by one of
</p>
<p>the above ambassadors, tliat they would never
</p>
<p>consent to the association of INIary with James in

<p>gratifying to the English Queen, they feared that,

<p>would, stimulate him to exertions in the cause

</p>
<p>keep James under reGtras'iit, uritil Elizabetli was
</p>
<p>able to accomplish her designs ; and the King was
</p>
<p>thus compelled to coincide with what, through
</p>
<p>their machinations, he could not otherwise avoid.
</p>
<p>There cannot be the slightest doubt that this
</p>
<p>was one of the intentions of those who contrived
</p>
<p>the Raid of Kuthven. Whether or not they knew
</p>
<p>the catastro})he which was destined for Mary, it
</p>
<p>was evidently their design to render the King
</p>
<p>powerless and inefficient, by endeavouring to effect
</p>
<p>the ruin of all those noblemen who were inclined
</p>
<p>to pity the unfortunate Queen, and by stimulating
</p>
<p>the senseless and furious preachers to excite the
</p>
<p>vulgar who attended them in shoals, that they
</p>
<p>might secure adherents among the nobles. James
</p>
<p>knew all this well, and, as the report of Lennox's
</p>
<p>death had been clearly ascertained, conceiving that
</p>
<p>they were now freed from a dangerous enemy,
</p>
<p>they guarded the King with less care than when
</p>
<p>they were daily under apprehensions that the
</p>
<p>Duke would suddenly return. As for Arran, he
</p>
<p>was so universally obnoxious, that he caused little
</p>
<p>uneasiness. The King was accordingly enabled to
</p>
<p>arrange a plan for liis escape with the Earls of
</p>
<p>Argyle, Marischall, Rotlies, and Montrose, and he
</p>
<p>appointed a convention of the estates, to be held at
</p>
<p>St Andrew's in May 1583, to which these noble-
</p>
<p>men were specially summoned. Few of the con-
</p>
<p>federated nobles were then at court; and James, in
</p>
<p>the meaavvjjile, left Edinburgh, with the intention
</p>
<p>of making a journey through Fife and the neigh-
</p>
<p>bouring counties, before the meeting of the con-
</p>
<p>vention. He first proceeded to the palace of

<p>Falkland, wliere he communicated his plan of
</p>
<p>escape to William Stewart, Captain of the Guard,
</p>
<p>252 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>and received the hearty co-operation of that officer.
</p>
<p>It was arranged, that the King should set out for
</p>
<p>St Andrew's, under the pretence of paying Jiis
</p>
<p>uncle, the Earl of March, a visit, while the noble-
</p>
<p>men, who were privy to the King's plans, were to
</p>
<p>take up their residence in the castle of that city.
</p>
<p>A few days before the convention met, the King
</p>
<p>left Falkland, and he was joined at Dairsie in his
</p>
<p>progress by some barons who were opposed to the
</p>
<p>confederacy. Exulting at his escape, James amus-
</p>
<p>ed himself with hawking by the way ; and he ar-
</p>
<p>rived at St Andrew's without interruption. Yet
</p>
<p>Lis joy at having regained his liberty seems to have
</p>
<p>been imprudently expressed, and almost to have
</p>
<p>thrown him off his guard ; for he slept the first
</p>
<p>night in one of the inns of St Andrew's, where
</p>
<p>he had little protection from surprise by his late
</p>
<p>keepers. Next day, James entered the Castle of
</p>
<p>St Andrew's, where he was attended by the Earls
</p>
<p>of Marischall, Montrose, and other noblemen. The
</p>
<p>gates were ordered to be shut, and Stewart, the
</p>
<p>Captain of the Guard, was intrusted with the
</p>
<p>command. A new privy council was appointed ;
</p>
<p>and the Earl of Gowrie, although the most active
</p>
<p>of those concerned in the Raid of Ruthven, con-
</p>
<p>trived to be admitted into favour. This was done
</p>
<p>at the intercession of Stewart, though not without
</p>
<p>great difficulty. Gowrie was compelled to ask
</p>
<p>pardon on his knees, and humbly to profess his
</p>
<p>sorrow for the share he had sustained in the cap-
</p>
<p>ture of the King. Even Arran, though at first
</p>
<p>also refused, was permitted to come to Court;
</p>
<p>and we shall afterwards see the share he took in

<p>public affiiirs.
</p>
<p>It was not to be expected that the King would
</p>
<p>V. THE RAID OF RUTHVEN. 253
</p>
<p>allow this bold exploit to pass unnoticed ; nor yet
</p>
<p>was Arran inclined to loolc with friendly feelings
</p>
<p>on those who had attempted to ruin him with tho
</p>
<p>King. Yet few princes in James' situation, con-
</p>
<p>sidering the insults and provocations he had re-
</p>
<p>ceived, could have behaved wit!) greater clemency
</p>
<p>and wisdom than he did on this occasion. He
</p>
<p>published a declaration, in which he expressed
</p>
<p>how sensible he was of the treasonable attempt
</p>
<p>on his person at Ruthven ; yet, willing to forgive
</p>
<p>all past offences, if the actors in, and defenders of
</p>
<p>that exploit, would show themselves penitent, cravo
</p>
<p>pardon in due time, and not provoke him by any
</p>
<p>farther unlawful actions, to remember that trea-
</p>
<p>sonable attempt. This proclamation, however,
</p>
<p>had little effect. Arran was determined to revenge
</p>
<p>himself on his enemies, who were both numerous
</p>
<p>and powerful, and he contrived to accompany this
</p>
<p>act of indemnity by certain conditions, which, in
</p>
<p>effect, defeated the ends of the proclamation. As
</p>
<p>they expected little good, therefore, from Arran,
</p>
<p>they scrupled not to set at nought the declaration,
</p>
<p>and to employ themselves in making the best pro-
</p>
<p>vision they could for their own safety. The most
</p>
<p>turbulent of them were accordingly confined to va-
</p>
<p>rious places ^throughout the country ; but as they
</p>
<p>chose also to disobey the charge, with the excep-
</p>
<p>tion of the Earl of Angus, they were denounced
</p>
<p>as rebels, and proclamations issued against them.
</p>
<p>Various other proclamations followed, which were
</p>
<p>sufficiently severe. The convention which assem-
</p>
<p>bled at Perth made it a capital crime for any one to
</p>
<p>deny that the Duke of Lennox had not died a sincere

<p>the circumstances attending t)ie seizure and deten-
</p>
<p>tion of the King's person at Ruth^en ; and a third,
</p>
<p>which was levelled against the nobility who had
</p>
<p>disregarded the first proclamation and indemnity,
</p>
<p>ordered all loyal subjects, between the ages of six-
</p>
<p>teen and sixty, within the sherifi'dom of Fife, to
</p>
<p>attend the King at Falkland on the 24th day of
</p>
<p>August 1583, well armed, and carrying with them
</p>
<p>provisions for fifteen days, under the penalties of
</p>
<p>death, and forfeiture of lands and goods.
</p>
<p>While the King and his advisers were thus en-
</p>
<p>gaged in restraining the seditious practices of the
</p>
<p>associated Lords, it was not likely that the minis-
</p>
<p>ters would view these transactions with indiifer-
</p>
<p>ence. They held a General Assembly on the
</p>
<p>10th of October, in which they proceeded to draw-
</p>
<p>up certain articles to be presented to the King, in
</p>
<p>which they set forth all their grievances, real or
</p>
<p>imaginary. Among other individuals whom they
</p>
<p>attacked were the King of France, the Duke of
</p>
<p>Guise, " and other Papists there," the Earls of
</p>
<p>Huntly, Crawford, and others in this country,
</p>
<p>whom they characterized as " apostates," " sworn
</p>
<p>enemies to Christ," " traitors," " maintainers of
</p>
<p>idolatry," " wicked and obstinate Papists," " traf-
</p>
<p>fickers against God." * Various other griev-
</p>
<p>ances, of a more personal nature, were also enu-
</p>
<p>merated, and laid before the King. But the
</p>
<p>reception those articles met with from James,

</p>
<p>dinarily active in their justification of the llaid of
</p>
<p>Ruthven, and, in particular, the famous Andrew

<p>Melville liad made no secret of Ins opinions. This
</p>
<p>individual, who first introduced Preshyterianism
</p>
<p>into Scotland, liad, ever since his arrival from Ge-
</p>
<p>neva, kept the kingdom in a continual turmoil.
</p>
<p>His zeal transported liim heyond the hounds of
</p>
<p>prudence and moderation, and frequently led him
</p>
<p>to act in a manner which no well-constituted go-
</p>
<p>vernment could tolerate. Honest and sincere he
</p>
<p>douhtless was in his religious notions, but his irri-
</p>
<p>table temper hurried him into the most extrava-
</p>
<p>gant excesses. It has been already observed, that
</p>
<p>the ministers were leagued with Gowrie and the
</p>
<p>associated Lords in their seditious attempt upon
</p>
<p>tiie King's person at Kuthven, and it was their
</p>
<p>interest to justify the whole plot to the people in
</p>
<p>their pulpit lucubrations. In 1583, Melville preach-
</p>
<p>ed a sermon on the famous fast-day which tiie mi-
</p>
<p>nisters had appointed to be held when they insult-
</p>
<p>ed the Irench and)assadors ; and as the Presby-
</p>
<p>terian preachers of that age generally harangued
</p>
<p>their hearers from the most violent passages in the
</p>
<p>JewisJj Scriptures, Melville's sermon was founded
</p>
<p>on the fourth chapter of the l^rophecy of Daniel,
</p>
<p>which narrates the catastrophe of Belshazzar, as
</p>
<p>indicated by the famous hand- writing on the wall,
</p>
<p>interpreted by the I'rophet himself. The sermon

<p>was preached at St Andrew's; but it was so vio-

</p>
<p>Presbytery ; and that neither the King nor Coun-
</p>
<p>cil could, i7i prima instantia, meddle therewith,
</p>
<p>though the speeches were treasonable." * This
</p>
<p>logic, however, made little impression on the King,
</p>
<p>who was present, or the Council, who were irri-
</p>
<p>tated at his insolent behaviour. But Melville
</p>
<p>cared little for the presence or the person of his
</p>
<p>sovereign. " You are too bold," said he, " in a
</p>
<p>regular Christian church, to pass by the pastors,
</p>
<p>prophets, and doctors, and to take upon yourselves
</p>
<p>to judge the doctrine, and controul the ambassa-

<p>instructions and warrant, and see if any of you
</p>
<p>can controul me, or say that I have exceeded

<p>my injunctions." This deplorable and insolent
</p>
<p>language astonished the Council. " Sir," said
</p>
<p>Arran, who was Chancellor, taking up the Bible
</p>
<p>and presenting it to the King, " he scorneth your
</p>
<p>Majesty." " Nay," replied Melville, " I scorn
</p>
<p>not, I am in good earnest." After various exami-
</p>
<p>nations he was dismissed, and ordered to enter
</p>
<p>himself at the Castle of Blackness within twenty-
</p>
<p>four hours ; but Melville, conscious that he had
</p>
<p>justly oft'ended, fled that night to Berwick. Pro-

<p>lurked about longer than the time assigned him
</p>
<p>for his departure, under various pretences ; even

<p>for four or five months after the departure of Mar

<p>that he would depart " this day and that day. " *
</p>
<p>The time specified for the final departure of Gow-

<p>timation to him, and those of his associates who
</p>
<p>had not obeyed the royal proclamation, that if they
</p>
<p>failed, they would be apprehended and punished
</p>
<p>as rebels. Gowrie had previously joined in con-

<p>demning the Raid of Ruthven, in which he had
</p>
<p>been a distinguished actor ; but finding that this
</p>
<p>admission did not mitigate his punishment, he

<p>again recanted, and corresponded with his former

<p>evasions, continued to disregard the proclamation,
</p>
<p>and resided at Dundee, where he found means to
</p>
<p>arrange the projected enterprise. It was concluded
</p>
<p>that Mar and Glammis, with their friends, should
</p>
<p>return from Ireland, and proceed to Stirling, where
</p>
<p>they would be joined by Gowrie and the Earl of
</p>
<p>Angus, the latter of whom had been recently re-
</p>
<p>called from exile, but confined on his parole to his
</p>
<p>own house in the North. Mustering their friends
</p>
<p>and forces at Stirling, they were thence to send
</p>
<p>a supplication to the King, setting forth the ima-
</p>
<p>ginary dangers which then threatened both church
</p>
<p>and state. In the meanwhile, Mar and the Mas-
</p>
<p>ter of Glammis were to surprise the Castle of
</p>
<p>Stirling, after they had been joined by Gowrie and
</p>
<p>Angus. Several other noblemen were connected
</p>
<p>with this conspiracy, though at the time they re-
</p>
<p>mained neutral, particularly the Earl of Bothwell,
</p>
<p>and Lord Lindsay.
</p>
<p>Such was the plan which Gowrie and his as-
</p>
<p>sociates had adopted for the recovering of their
</p>
<p>influence and power ; and there can be little doubt
</p>
<p>that he had induced the banished noblemen to take
</p>
<p>part in this entei*prise, as they seem to have been
</p>
<p>guided solely by his representations. In pur-

<p>and Glammis arrived in Scotland in tlie month of
</p>
<p>April, and, with the aid of Angus, began to collect
</p>
<p>their followers for the attack on Stirling. But the
</p>
<p>vigilance of the King gave the first hlow to the
</p>
<p>confederacy. On the 16th of April, only two days
</p>
<p>before the intended surprise of Stirling Castle,
</p>
<p>Go^Tie was apprehended at Dundee, by Stewart,
</p>
<p>Captain of the Royal Guard, specially deputed for
</p>
<p>that purpose. Gowrie, who was completely aware
</p>
<p>of the treasons in whicli he was engaged, made a
</p>
<p>brave resistance before he was taken prisoner, and
</p>
<p>held out his house in Dundee for some hours in
</p>
<p>defiance of the royal commission, and the soldiers
</p>
<p>under Stewart's command. *
</p>
<p>The confederacy, however, had been amply ma-
</p>
<p>tured before Gowrie's apprehension, which, it
</p>
<p>would appear, had been etiected very unexpected-
</p>
<p>ly, f as there is every reason to conclude that his
</p>
<p>associates were not aware of tlie fact. He was
</p>
<p>apprehended on the 16th of April ; and had they
</p>
<p>received intelligence of the activity of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment, they would certainly have paused before
</p>
<p>they proceeded to extremes. In full reliance,
</p>
<p>however, on Gowrie's assistance, more especially

<p>of the unhappy state of the government. This
</p>
<p>manifesto, which, according to Calderwood, was
</p>
<p>Issued on the 22(1 of April, was not very remark-
</p>
<p>able for its moderation. After a long preamble,
</p>
<p>in which they affected to be actuated by motives
</p>
<p>of pure patriotism, they indulged in bitter invec-
</p>
<p>tives against those who were then at the Court,
</p>
<p>terming them " an insolent company, manifest and
</p>
<p>avowed Papists, Atheists, and excommunicated

<p>cluded by maintaining that they alone had " the

<p>fear of God before their eyes. " f
</p>
<p>Intelligence of this bold exploit having reached
</p>
<p>the metropolis, where the King then resided, and

<p>roused the government to activity, a proclamation
</p>
<p>was speedily issued by James, commanding his

<p>subjects to follow him to Stirling, with provision

<p>for thirty days, while a few of the nobles at court

<p>The citizens of the metropolis evinced a remark-
</p>
<p>able zeal for the King, and the town-council even
</p>
<p>advanced money to pay soldiers who would en-
</p>
<p>list. * It was on the 1 9th of April that informa-
</p>
<p>tion of the surprise of Stirling Castle was received;
</p>
<p>and before the 24th, two days after the insurgents'
</p>
<p>manifesto had appeared, a considerable army was
</p>
<p>in readiness to march against the rebels, amounting
</p>
<p>to nearly 20,000 men. The tidings of these ac-
</p>
<p>tive preparations soon reached the insurgents, but
</p>
<p>already had they become disheartened. The ap-
</p>
<p>prehension of Gowrie had dissipated their hopes,
</p>
<p>as they imagined that it was a mere pretence on
</p>
<p>Lis part to betray them, he having deserted them
</p>
<p>once before. Their friends and followers also
</p>
<p>were more tardy in espousing their cause titan
</p>
<p>they were led to anticipate ; while Elizabeth, wlio
</p>
<p>had been the clsief exciter of the exploit, had ne-
</p>
<p>glected to fulfil her promise by sending them the
</p>
<p>expected supply of money. They had possession
</p>
<p>of the fortress but a few days, wlien they were
</p>
<p>disheartened and irresolute. They had only 300

<p>men with tliem to oppose the royal army, which

<p>was commanded by their implacable enemies.

</p>
<p>King at t!ie first summons. We are informed by
</p>
<p>Calderwood, that there were only twenty-eight
</p>
<p>men in the garrison, and of these the captain and
</p>
<p>three others were executed. * The command of
</p>
<p>the Castle was given to Arran, and " this rash
</p>
<p>and feeble attempt produced such effects as usually
</p>
<p>follow disappointed conspiracies. It not only hurt
</p>
<p>the cause for which it was undertaken, but added
</p>
<p>strength and reputation to the King, confirmed
</p>
<p>Arran's power, and 'enabled them to pursue their
</p>
<p>measures with more boldness and greater suc-
</p>
<p>cess." f
</p>
<p>The government now turned their attention to
</p>
<p>the principal agitators. Of these Gowrie was the
</p>
<p>only one of rank in custody, and as he had be-
</p>
<p>come incorrigible from his inveterate propensity to
</p>
<p>turbulence and mischief, it was resolved to bring
</p>
<p>him to trial. He had been brought by sea to
</p>
<p>Leith, and thence had been removed to the me-
</p>
<p>tropolis, where he remained a prisoner. At the
</p>
<p>King's command he was removed to Stirling,
</p>
<p>where the Court continued to reside after the re-
</p>
<p>covery of the Castle. He was accordingly re-
</p>
<p>moved thither ; and on the fourth of May, 1584, he
</p>
<p>was put on his defence before a jury of his peers
</p>
<p>for high treason. There were also tried at the
</p>
<p>same time two of the persons engaged in the^ af-
</p>
<p>fair, Archibald Douglas and John Forbes. The
</p>
<p>charges against him were four, and of a singular
</p>
<p>import, "1st, That he nitended and had begun a

<p>married Isabel, a daughter of Lord Livingstone of
</p>
<p>Saltcoats, in the county of Haddington. * The
</p>
<p>jury of peers consisted of the Earls of Arran, Ar-
</p>
<p>gyle, Crawford, Montrose, Glencairn, Eglinton,
</p>
<p>Marischall, Lords Saltoun, Somerville, Doon, Liv-
</p>
<p>ingstone, Drummond, Ogilvy, Oliphant, the Laird
</p>
<p>of Tullibardine, and the Master of Elphingstone.
</p>
<p>Of these, Montrose, Livingstone, Drummond, and
</p>
<p>Ogilvy, were connected by relationship with the fa-
</p>
<p>mily of Ruthven, -|- and from that circumstance it
</p>
<p>has been concluded that the King wished to save
</p>
<p>Gowrie, otherwise he would not have placed so
</p>
<p>many of his relations among his judges.
</p>
<p>Wiiile Gowrie remained at Edinburgh, before
</p>
<p>his arrival at Stirling, he was examined by the
</p>
<p>Earl of Montrose, Lord Doon, and Sir Robert
</p>
<p>Melville, to whom he confessed that he had cor-
</p>
<p>responded with the exiled noblemen, but positive-
</p>
<p>ly denied that he intended to seize the King's per-
</p>
<p>son. Indeed, he admitted almost the whole of the
</p>
<p>charges, and confessed that the Earls of Maris-
</p>
<p>chall and Bothwell, Lord Lindsay, and some of
</p>
<p>the Western Barons, were connected with the con-
</p>
<p>federacy  that they expected a supply from Eng-
</p>
<p>land  and that Elizabeth intended to induce the
</p>
<p>in Mr Pitcairn's Criminal Trials, of which the above, how-
</p>
<p>ever, is the substance. Gowrie was found guilty of " not
</p>
<p>onlie maist innaturallie and treasonablie committing maist
</p>
<p>hie treasoun, in conceling of ane purpois of sa wechtie im-
</p>

<p>Hamilton8 to join them. His request for an au-
</p>
<p>dience of the King, which he made by letter ad-
</p>
<p>dressed to James himself, was denied ; and as he
</p>
<p>had added, in a postscript, that it was not the con-
</p>
<p>cealing of treason of which he intended to speak
</p>
<p>to the King, but " the revealing of a benefit, " this
</p>
<p>expression was made a part of the indictment
</p>
<p>against him.
</p>
<p>It is not to be denied, however, that the trial
</p>
<p>proceeded in a very summary manner, and that
</p>
<p>though the fact of treason was indisputable, Cow-
</p>
<p>rie's judges were by no means disposed to allow
</p>
<p>him the benefit of the law. He objected to Gor-
</p>
<p>don of Lochinvar, on account of some family dif-
</p>
<p>ferences existing between them, which objection
</p>
<p>was overruled. He observed, secondly, that the
</p>
<p>noblemen who examined him had given a solemn
</p>
<p>pledge, that whatsoever he confessed would not be
</p>
<p>alleged against him ; whereas, what he then ad-
</p>
<p>mitted was now made part of the indictment. To
</p>
<p>this it was answered, that those noblemen had no
</p>
<p>power to give him any such assurance. Thirdly,
</p>
<p>he maintained, that as he was charged with trea-
</p>
<p>son, he ought to have had a citation of forty days
</p>
<p>notice, and his accuser specified ; but it was re-
</p>
<p>plied, that in matters of treason, the King could ar-
</p>
<p>rest the person at all times. Fourthly, he raised
</p>
<p>an objection on the merits of his license to leave
</p>
<p>the country, which was also repelled. His last ob-
</p>
<p>jection was, that what he had offered to reveal to
</p>
<p>the King was not connected with the charges, but
</p>
<p>for the King's own benefit ; and to this it was re-
</p>
<p>plied, that his concealing of the affair was criminal,

</p>
<p>The objections being thus overruled, the jury

</p>
<p>found Gowrie guilty of high treason, and, with his
</p>
<p>two companions, of being engaged in a conspiracy
</p>
<p>against the King and Government. Gowrie was
</p>
<p>accordingly sentenced to be beheaded at the mar-
</p>
<p>ket-cross of Stirling, and his body to be dismem-
</p>
<p>bered as a traitor. The other two were ordered
</p>
<p>to be hanged.
</p>
<p>On the evening of the same day, betwixt the
</p>
<p>hours of eight and nine, Gowrie was led out to
</p>
<p>execution. Douglas and Forbes had been execut-
</p>
<p>ed immediately after their sentence. He made a
</p>
<p>long speech on the scaffold, which was much ex-
</p>
<p>tolled by the Presbyterian ministers, on account of
</p>
<p>its piety and spirit of resignation. He professed
</p>
<p>that all his actions were intended for the benefit of
</p>
<p>the King, and endeavoured to free the other nobles,
</p>
<p>and the Presbyterian ministers who were engaged
</p>
<p>in his practices, from any charge or intention of
</p>
<p>treason. He observed, in conclusion, as is usual
</p>
<p>in these circumstances, that had he served God as
</p>
<p>faithfully as he had done the King, he would not
</p>
<p>have come to that end. He conducted himself
</p>
<p>with the utmost resolution. He calmly laid his
</p>
<p>head on the block, and it was severed from his
</p>
<p>body at one blow. The other part of the sentence
</p>
<p>was remitted, and his servants were allowed to
</p>
<p>inter his body. * His estates were seized, and an
</p>
<p>act of attainder and confiscation was passed by the

<p>government, f

<p>Thus perished on t!ie scaffold the first Earl of
</p>
<p>Gowrie, a nobleman whose life had been a con-
</p>
<p>tinued scene of intrigues, factions, and cabals.
</p>
<p>Two days after his execution, on the 6th of May,
</p>
<p>the King departed for Edinburgh, having given the
</p>
<p>government of Stirling Castle to Arran. Elisto-
</p>
<p>riaus agree in assigning to Gowrie a very high cha-
</p>
<p>racter for ability, but unquestionably he had given
</p>
<p>no great indications of superior talents. He appears
</p>
<p>to have been a man of great irresolution, and sensible
</p>
<p>of his rashness when it was too late to retrieve his
</p>
<p>errors. Connected as he was with the more violent
</p>
<p>of the Presbyterian ministers, whose sole study it
</p>
<p>was to insult and oppose the King, he of course
</p>
<p>received from them the incense of applause, and
</p>
<p>was held by them as one of the greatest patriots
</p>
<p>of his age. But although much may be said in

</p>
<p>of Bothwell, in the following year, with the Mas-
</p>
<p>ter of Gray and others, entered into a treasonable
</p>
<p>correspondence with the Court of Spain, and ac-
</p>
<p>tually assaulted the Palace of Falkland at mid-
</p>
<p>night, in which they would have been successful,
</p>
<p>had they not been vigorously opposed by the in-
</p>
<p>mates of the palace, and some of the neighbour-
</p>
<p>ing inhabitants. They betook themselves to flight,
</p>
<p>but not before they had plundered the royal sta-
</p>
<p>bles and the park of the horses. Several of those
</p>
<p>conspirators were also slain or hanged. In the
</p>
<p>year 1596, a most outrageous attack was made
</p>
<p>on the King and Council when assembled in the
</p>
<p>Tolbooth, by the rabble of Edinburgh, excited by
</p>
<p>the ministers, one of whom had prepared them for
</p>
<p>it, by edifying them with a sermon in Haddo's Hold
</p>
<p>Church on the story of Haman. There were num-
</p>
<p>erous other attempts of less note ; and it is some-

<p>was baptized on the 25th September 1575, and

<p>was therefore in the twenty-fifth year of his age at

<p>the time of liis death. His brother Alexander
</p>
<p>was baptized on the 22d of January 1580-1, and
</p>
<p>was only nineteen. *
</p>
<p>Both the brothers had resided for a considera-
</p>
<p>ble time in Italy. The Earl of Gowrie was at the
</p>
<p>University of Padua, and left that place in 1599,
</p>
<p>on his return to Scotland. During his residence
</p>
<p>there, he had pursued the advantages which bis
</p>
<p>high rank aflbrded him ; he was skilled in every
</p>
<p>martial accomplishment, and he had received an
</p>
<p>education which his talents enabled him to im-
</p>
<p>prove. His external appearance, too, was noble,
</p>
<p>and the qualities of his mind are said to have
</p>
<p>equalled the handsomeness of his person. Possessed
</p>
<p>of no inconsiderable influence, his return, of course,
</p>
<p>was hailed with rapture by the ministers, as the
</p>
<p>head of a house with which they had been long
</p>
<p>William Ruthven, the fourth son, went abroad, and be-

<p>came famous as a chemist. Patrick Ruthven, was a phy-

<p>sician, and was confined many years in the Tower of Lon-
</p>
<p>don. He was released in 1619. His daughter married

<p>Vandyke, the famous painter. Lady Margaret Ruthven

<p>mother of the great Marquis. Lady Mary married the

<p>connected, and whose father they pretended had
</p>
<p>died a martyr for their cause. It is to be observ-
</p>
<p>ed, too, that one of the most popular preachers
</p>
<p>had been preceptor to Gowrie and his brother, as,
</p>
<p>indeed, he had been to all the first Earl's children.
</p>
<p>This was Robert Rollock, appointed Principal and
</p>
<p>Professor of Divinity in the University of Edinburgh,
</p>
<p>at which University Gowrie had received the degree
</p>
<p>of Master of Arts, who had failed not to enforce the
</p>
<p>favourite topic of his brethren, and had instilled into
</p>
<p>the minds of Gowrie and his brother the alleged
</p>
<p>injustice of the sentence which had deprived their
</p>
<p>father of his life. It would be unfair, however, to
</p>
<p>insinuate, that Gowrie's preceptor, or the minis-
</p>
<p>ters in general, were the contrivers of his enter-
</p>
<p>prise, or incited him to the rash adventure. But
</p>
<p>it is clear, that the idea of his father having been
</p>
<p>murdered, aided by his youthful ardour, his natu-
</p>
<p>rally bold disposition, his popularity with the mi-
</p>
<p>nisters, his ambition, and his connexions both with
</p>
<p>England and the popular party, as well as his near
</p>
<p>affinity to the royal family, must have deeply im-
</p>
<p>pressed his mind, and made him view the King
</p>
<p>with no very kindly feelings of loyal attachment.
</p>
<p>The earldom of Gowrie, as has been already
</p>
<p>observed, had been restored after the forfeiture of
</p>
<p>the first Earl, in the person of his eldest son, who,
</p>
<p>at the time of his death in 1588, was in the four-
</p>
<p>teenth year of his age. His brother John suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded to the honours and estates, at that time a
</p>
<p>mere youth ; and it is to be observed, that had
</p>
<p>James intended, as has been alleged, to destroy

<p>the Ruthven family, it is not likely that he would

<p>King seems to have been anxious to make all
</p>
<p>the reparation possible for the manner of the first
</p>
<p>Earl's deatlf, as if he had been actuated by a sort
</p>
<p>of compunction on account of the manner of it ;
</p>
<p>for, besides restoring to the family all their pos-
</p>
<p>sessions and honours, Alexander lluthven was
</p>
<p>made one of tiie Royal Bed-chamber ; his sis-
</p>
<p>ter, Lady Beatrice, was appointed INIaid of Ho-
</p>
<p>nour to the Queen ; and 8pottiswoode observes,
</p>
<p>that James " had a purpose to advance the Earl
</p>
<p>himself to a principal office in the kingdom."
</p>
<p>These facts incontestably prove, that James could
</p>
<p>have no secret hatred towards a family with whom
</p>
<p>he was nearly allied even in relationship.
</p>
<p>Gowrie, after the decease of his brother, had
</p>
<p>proceeded to the Continent in ISQ-i, under the
</p>
<p>care of William Rhynd, who is "mentioned as the
</p>
<p>first Rector of the School of Perth, and who after-
</p>
<p>wards was one of the witnesses in the investiga-
</p>
<p>tion of the enterprise. He was Rector of that
</p>
<p>School in March 1390, and was a man of con-
</p>
<p>siderable learning. In 1594, he attended Gowrie
</p>
<p>and his brother to Padua, but he returned in 1597,
</p>
<p>three years before the Earl. He does not appear
</p>
<p>to have been connected with the enterprise of the
</p>
<p>two brothers, as will appear from his depositions,
</p>
<p>and other facts in the sequel. In Padua, Gowrie
</p>
<p>greatly distinguished himself ; he was chosen Rec-
</p>
<p>tor of the University on one occasion, and his name
</p>
<p>and arms were emblazoned in the College-hall.

<p>While he was on the Continent, he visited Geneva,
</p>
<p>and resided tiiree months with the celebrated Theo-

</p>
<p>asylum at Geneva, if they chose to accept his in-
</p>
<p>vitation.
</p>
<p>While Gowrie was at Padua, he received a let-
</p>
<p>ter from the King, which appears to have been
</p>
<p>complimentary, and written in James' usual good-
</p>
<p>natured manner. He wrote an answer to this let-
</p>
<p>ter, dated Padua, 24th September 1593, the origi-
</p>
<p>nal of which is preserved in the University of
</p>
<p>Edinburgh.* In the year 1599, he left Padua,
</p>
<p>and visited the court of Henry IV. at Paris, where
</p>
<p>he was received with marked distinction. From
</p>
<p>Paris he proceeded to England, and Elizabeth en-
</p>
<p>tertained him in a manner which was flattering to
</p>
<p>his pride, and gratifying to his ambition. " She
</p>
<p>ordered that guards should attend him ; that all the
</p>
<p>honours should be paid to him which were due to
</p>
<p>a Prince of Wales, and to her first cousin ; and
</p>
<p>that he should be entertained at the public expense
</p>
<p>all the time he should remain at her court." '\ It
</p>
<p>is impossible to say what might have been concert-
</p>
<p>ed between him and Elizabeth, but those marked
</p>
<p>distinctions were extremely injudicious ; nor need
</p>
<p>we wonder at his haughty demeanour towards the
</p>
<p>King, when he waited on James at Edinburgh af-
</p>
<p>ter his arrival from the English Court in 1600. Be-

<p>fore his arriral, his friends and partisans had made
</p>
<p>known his intention of passing through Edinburgh
</p>
<p>on his way to Perth, and multitudes resorted to
</p>
<p>see the young Earl of Gowrie enter the city. It
</p>
<p>is said, that beholding the crowd as he passed
</p>
<p>along the streets, he peevishly observed, " There
</p>
<p>were as many people who conveyed his father to
</p>
<p>the scaffold at Stirling."
</p>
<p>It is not my intention here to insert all the
</p>
<p>stories which have been told respecting Gowrie
</p>
<p>and the King, his brother Alexander, his sister
</p>
<p>Beatrice, the alleged intrigue of the Queen and
</p>
<p>Alexander Ruthven, all of which stories have
</p>
<p>been raked together by the admirers of Gowrie,
</p>
<p>without considering whether they were true or
</p>
<p>false, for the purpose of proving James' hatred
</p>
<p>to the Ruthven family. Some of them may be
</p>
<p>true ; perhaps they are all idle traditions ; but cer-
</p>
<p>tainly they are extremely silly, and do not in the
</p>
<p>slightest degree elucidate the enterprise of Gowrie,
</p>
<p>or bear against the character of the King. It
</p>
<p>was on the 20th of May 1600, that the Earl
</p>
<p>of Gowrie arrived at Perth. A contemporary
</p>
<p>chronicler has related with minuteness the very
</p>
<p>hour of his anival at his palace in Perth call-
</p>
<p>ed Gowrie House, which was " at six hours in
</p>
<p>the evening, with a large retinue. " * The state
</p>
<p>of the country at the close of the sixteenth cen-
</p>
<p>tury, though apparently tranquil, was not much
</p>
<p>better than it had been in the preceding year of
</p>
<p>turbulence ; religious disputes still agitated the na-
</p>
<p>tion ; and the King had sufficiently exasperated

<p>The arrival of a nobleman, in the flower of liis
</p>

<p>Genevan theologians, whose family had been long
</p>
<p>viewed as the head of the party attached to Eng-
</p>
<p>land and the Presbyterian interest, whose accom-
</p>
<p>plishments were considerable, whose ambition was
</p>
<p>doubtless more aspiring on account of his royal
</p>
<p>descent, and whose influence over his extensive
</p>
<p>estates gave him additional importance, could not
</p>
<p>fail to be gratifying to the popular pai'ty. It is
</p>
<p>admitted by all, too, that Gowrie made very gi-eat
</p>
<p>pretensions to religion ; and his virtues and his
</p>
<p>principles were afterwards celebrated with more
</p>
<p>than ordinary panegyric. If it could be proved
</p>
<p>that Gowrie, during his absence, corresponded
</p>
<p>with the Presbyterian ministers, or any of their
</p>
<p>leaders, it would throw very considerable light on
</p>
<p>this affair ; but although it cannot be alleged with
</p>
<p>certainty, the fact is not improbable ; nay, it is al-
</p>
<p>most certain, that he would, from time to time,
</p>
<p>receive communications from his friends in Scot-
</p>
<p>land, relative to the state of the country, religion,
</p>
<p>and the court, and these would contain many al-
</p>
<p>lusions to his father's fate. That he corresponded
</p>
<p>with Logan of Restalrig, during his absence, is
</p>
<p>almost certain, as will appear in the sequel ; and
</p>
<p>this of itself, perhaps, is sufiieient authority for the
</p>
<p>preceding conjecture. The zeal of his preceptpr
</p>
<p>would also aggravate these representations, while
</p>
<p>they would become additional excitements to Gow-
</p>
<p>rie's ambition. Thus, two principles, ambition

</p>
<p>that the enterprise in which he was so soon after-

<p>wards engaged Iiad been formed in his mind before
</p>
<p>Iiis arrival in Scotland ;  at least, that he had de-
</p>
<p>termined to be guided by circumstances. It must
</p>
<p>not be forgotten, too, that the fanatics of that pe-
</p>
<p>riod frequently reproached James with bastardy,
</p>
<p>in their zeal to vindicate the murder of Rizzio ;
</p>
<p>and of course this would operate powerfully with
</p>
<p>Gowrie, inasmuch as certain expressions in the
</p>
<p>letters of Logan of Restalrig hint that he aimed
</p>
<p>at the crown ; and it is well known that he pro-
</p>
<p>pagated a rumour that his mother was descended
</p>
<p>from the Princess Margaret of England, daughter
</p>
<p>of Henry VII., and widow of James V., who had
</p>
<p>married Lord Ruthven ; which report was believed
</p>
<p>by the vulgar about Perth. ^ However ridiculous
</p>
<p>Gowrie's ambition may appear, as the House of
</p>
<p>Hamilton and other great families interposed be-
</p>
<p>tween him and the crown, it is more than probable
</p>
<p>that he entertained these notions in the ardour of

<p>youth, supported as he was by the " newlie erec-

<p>Gowrie's private habits, however, we have pretty
</p>
<p>good information furnished by contemporary writ-
</p>
<p>ers ; by which it appears, that notwithstanding
</p>
<p>the " sanguine hopes of the early virtues " of him
</p>
<p>and his brother, he was not without his own share
</p>
<p>of superstition, as was proved from various papers
</p>
<p>which were found in his possession after his death.
</p>
<p>" This Erie of Gourie, " says one author, " at his

<p>being in Italie, advysit with a mathematician ther,

</p>
<p>the fortune-tellers with whom Gowrie consulted,
</p>
<p>differed considerably from each other in their opi-
</p>
<p>nions about his future fortunes. In a letter from
</p>
<p>Nicolson to Secretary Cecil, dated 22d November
</p>
<p>1600, there is the following passage :  " One
</p>
<p>Colvil hath sent the King the collection of the for-

<p>tune to befall Gowrie upon his securitie, written
</p>
<p>with the Earle's hand in French at Orleans, and

<p>there found, containing that he should return, be

</p>
<p>his own hand, before he should be married. "

<p>towards him, that he was continued in that office

<p>even while he was in Italy. The town of Perth,
</p>
<p>at that period, and for centuries previous, yield-
</p>
<p>ed, perhaps, only to the metropolis in point
</p>
<p>of importance ; in it many of the principal no-
</p>
<p>bility had houses, and it had often been the fa-
</p>
<p>vourite residence of the Scottish monarchs. It
</p>
<p>was then called St Johnstoun, from the name of
</p>
<p>its tutelary patron, St John. In several of the
</p>
<p>public records or writs in the time of James VI.,
</p>
<p>it is called a city, and it still has some pretensions
</p>
<p>to that title, though never the seat of a bishop or
</p>
<p>of the government.
</p>
<p>In the Memorabilia of Perth, under the year
</p>
<p>1394, there is the following notice respecting the
</p>
<p>election of Gowrie as Provost :  " On the 6th
</p>
<p>of August, this year, the Earl told the council that
</p>
<p>be was to go abroad for his education ; they un-
</p>
<p>animously entered into a resolution to elect him
</p>
<p>Provost next Michaelmas, and became bound for
</p>
<p>their successors in office to elect him annually un-
</p>
<p>til he returned. This agreement is signed by the
</p>
<p>whole town-council, in presence of Mr Patrick
</p>
<p>Galloway, minister of Perth, the King's chaplain,
</p>
<p>and Henry Elder, town-clerk. "
</p>
<p>Gowrie, as we have seen, arrived at Perth,
</p>
<p>on the 20th of May 1600. On the 28th of June
</p>
<p>that year, there is a notice of his proceedings iu

<p>tiously pretended to take no part in the measures of
</p>
<p>the court. But while he was thus residing in a re-
</p>
<p>tired manner at his own house in Perth, he was by
</p>
<p>no means inactive in the great enterprise he con- _
</p>
<p>templated. In the immediate vicinity of Edin-
</p>
<p>burgh resided Robert Logan, who possessed the
</p>
<p>estate of llestalrig, which extends between the
</p>
<p>Frith of Forth and the city ; a turbulent baron,
</p>
<p>whose intrigues, schemes, and noted profligacy,
</p>
<p>were eventually the cause of his forfeiture. This
</p>
<p>baron had been deprived of a considerable part of
</p>
<p>his estate during the minority of James for his
</p>
<p>conduct, he being rather a troublesome neighbour
</p>
<p>to the citizens of Edinburgh ; and at this period
</p>
<p>his affairs were almost desperate. The family had
</p>
<p>made a considerable figure in the early history of
</p>
<p>the country, and were connected with some of the
</p>
<p>first nobility. With this baron, Gowrie was him-
</p>
<p>self remotely allied. Patrick, sixth Lord Gray, and
</p>
<p>father of the famous Master of Gray, married Bar-
</p>
<p>bara Ruthven, sister of Patrick, Lord Ruthven, who
</p>
<p>assassinated David Rizzio ; and that lady was the
</p>
<p>aunt of William, the first Earl of Gowrie. Agnes
</p>
<p>Gray, sister of the sixth Lord Gray, and aunt of
</p>
<p>the Master, married Sir Robert Logan of Restalrig,
</p>
<p>whom John Knox characterizes as a man " neither
</p>
<p>fortunate nor prudent ; " and that baron was the
</p>
<p>father of Robert Logan, the correspondent and as-
</p>
<p>sociate of Gowrie. *
</p>

<p>wards, by one George Sprot, a notary public at
</p>
<p>Eyemoutli, who was himself executed for his share
</p>
<p>in Gowrie's enterprise, and who confessed that he
</p>
<p>knew well that Logan was in the plot. Hardly had
</p>
<p>eight weeks elapsed after Gowrie's return, when a
</p>
<p>correspondence took place between him and Logan,
</p>
<p>by means of one James Bour, familiarly called
</p>
<p>Laird Bour, a servant of the latter, and of whose
</p>
<p>fidelity he entertained a very high opinion. Alex-
</p>
<p>ander Ruthven, the brother of Gowrie, appears to
</p>
<p>have been the only other person in the secret at
</p>
<p>that time. After many personal interviews, the
</p>
<p>object of which was to concert a plot for an at-
</p>
<p>tack on the King, a plan was devised to that ef-
</p>
<p>fect, which was intended to be put into execution
</p>
<p>on one of the King's hunting expeditions. Logan
</p>
<p>was then residing in Fastcastle, a castle or fort,
</p>
<p>now in complete ruins, situated in the parish of
</p>
<p>Coldingham, and county of Berwick, on the sea-
</p>
<p>side, and, from the steepness of the rock on which
</p>
<p>it is built, inaccessible on all sides, except by a
</p>
<p>narrow neck of land a few feet in breadth. At
</p>
<p>this period it belonged to the Logans of Restalrig,
</p>
<p>and the recollection of this fact will tend to throw
</p>
<p>considerable light on the history of this daring en-
</p>
<p>terprise. In a letter from Fastcastle, dated 10th
</p>
<p>July 1600, to a person whose name was never dis-
</p>
<p>covered, Laird Bour is introduced for the first time
</p>
<p>by Logan to his friend, who is styled right honour-
</p>
<p>able Sir ; and he endeavours to prepossess his cor-
</p>
<p>respondent with the same opinion which he held
</p>
<p>himself, respecting the worthy Laird. " Pleis zow

<p>He then mentions a meeting which was to take
</p>
<p>place between him and Alexander Ruthven on the
</p>
<p>ensuing week, " and be as warrie, " he says, " as

<p>which it appears that he had left Fastcastle on

</p>
<p>In a third letter to the " richt honorable " per-
</p>
<p>son, dated from the Canongate, 27th July 1600,
</p>
<p>Logan expresses his resolute determination " to

<p>" the skaftald were set up ; " and he intimates, that
</p>
<p>he had expected a visit of Gowrie and his brother
</p>
<p>at Fastcastle, in terms of letters he had written
</p>
<p>to them both. In this letter he also says of his
</p>
<p>friend the Laird, that " howbeit he be hot ane
</p>
<p>sillie aid gleyit carle, I will answer for him that
</p>
<p>he sail be verie true. " Two days after this let-
</p>
<p>ter, namely, on the 29th of July, Logan wrote to
</p>
<p>Gowrie, when the plot began to be arranged, in-
</p>
<p>forming him that he wished a meeting of the con-
</p>
<p>spirators in Fastcastle, but that it would be well
</p>
<p>for him to have a previous interview with the Earl
</p>
<p>and his brothers. In this letter, there are expres-
</p>
<p>sions which cannot be misunderstood. After ad-
</p>
<p>vising Gowrie to conduct himself with caution,
</p>
<p>Logan says, " I doubt not, hot with Godis grace,

</p>
<p>The cause of tliis treasonable correspondence
</p>
<p>may be easily conceived from the preceding nar-
</p>
<p>rative, and from the allusions in Logan's letters.
</p>
<p>It was a tender point to remind Gowrie of the
</p>
<p>" INIachiavellian massacring of his dearest friends,"
</p>
<p>when it had been religiously inculcated on him by
</p>
<p>his preceptor and others, that his father had been
</p>
<p>unjustly condemned  when the Presbyterian mi-
</p>
<p>nisters had declared the treasons of that nobleman
</p>
<p>*' good and acceptable services to God and the
</p>
<p>Church, "  and when the proceedings of James
</p>
<p>had already alienated or dissatisSed no inconsider-
</p>
<p>able portion of the nation. There is no evidence
</p>
<p>to prove that James hated the Gowrie family.
</p>
<p>Had he done so, it was not his interest to restore
</p>
<p>their honours and estates, and to distinguish them
</p>
<p>by many and repeated favours, as if he wished to
</p>
<p>make all the reparation possible for a sentence
</p>
<p>which had been executed in his minority, and of
</p>
<p>which, perhaps, he did not privately approve ; for
</p>
<p>he might have still retained their sentence of for-
</p>
<p>feiture, and even exile, and thus at once rid him-
</p>
<p>self of a family whose power and influence he
</p>
<p>might dread. But there is another very important
</p>
<p>circumstance which ought not to be forgotten. As

<p>by some means or other, the King was indebted to
</p>
<p>him the sum of 196,465/. ISs. 6d. Scots money,
</p>
<p>including the accumulated principal and interest ;
</p>
<p>and the greater part of this sum had been proba-
</p>
<p>bly advanced to the King by Gowrie out of his
</p>
<p>own private purse, for it is well known that James
</p>
<p>was in the habit of borrowing from every person who
</p>
<p>would lend him money. Now, had the King wish-
</p>
<p>ed to destroy the Gowrie family, he would never
</p>
<p>have restored them to their former rank, and ac-
</p>
<p>tually ratified to the son that sum of money he
</p>
<p>owed his father. This, however, he did. The
</p>
<p>King was indebted to the Earl, as representing his
</p>
<p>father ; and it appears, from the state of the ac-
</p>
<p>counts rendered on the 10th of May 1583, that
</p>
<p>the balance claimed by Gowrie amounted to
</p>
<p>48,063/. 45. 8d. Scots, " which," observes Arnot,
</p>
<p>" as Scottish money was greater, by the lialf, at
</p>
<p>that time than it is now, was 72,094/. 175. of our
</p>
<p>present Scottish money of principal, besides seven-
</p>
<p>teen years (from 1583 to 1600) interest, at the
</p>
<p>then rate of 10 per cent. " James restored the
</p>
<p>family by a solemn act in December 1585, and
</p>
<p>at the same time ratified the debt he owed to
</p>
<p>the first Earl ; but from the King's well-known
</p>
<p>indigence, he was unable to pay it in 1600, after
</p>
<p>Gowrie's return from Italy ; and as the Scottish
</p>
<p>Peers, before the Union, were liable to be ar-
</p>
<p>rested for debt, the young Earl was considerably
</p>
<p>embarrassed in his circumstances, doubtless by the
</p>
<p>clamorous conduct of his creditors. What kind
</p>
<p>of application may have been made to the King
</p>
<p>by Gowrie does not appear ; but on the 20th of

</p>
<p>from his death ; " and from the common law, "
</p>
<p>observes Amot, " as well as the silence of the

<p>were never paid. " *
</p>
<p>To proceed, however, with the narrative. It is
</p>
<p>inexplicable how it was that Logan and his agent,
</p>
<p>Laird Bour, kept aloof from the active part of the
</p>
<p>conspiracy ; but doubtless it had been all arranged,
</p>
<p>and probably Logan had betaken himself to his re-
</p>
<p>sidence of Fastcastle, there to receive the King,
</p>
<p>after he had been secured by Gowrie and his bro-
</p>
<p>ther ; for it will be recollected, that such was part
</p>
<p>of the plot of the conspirators. It was on the 5th
</p>
<p>day of August 1600, that Gowrie, knowing that
</p>
<p>the King was then at Falkland Palace in Fife,
</p>
<p>which is an easy ride of between two and three
</p>
<p>hours from Perth, despatched his brother Alex-
</p>
<p>ander, to invite James to Gowrie House, under
</p>
<p>the pretence that a person had been secured who
</p>
<p>was a Jesuit, and who pretended that he was pos-
</p>
<p>sessed of a quantity of gold ; but that it was neces-

<p>* The writer of the Traditional Account in the Town of

<p>Perth, of the death of John Earl of Gowrie, whose name
</p>
<p>was Duff, minister of Tibbermuir, sets out with this flou-
</p>
<p>rishing paragraph:  " After the King had come to the
</p>
<p>full years of majority, he found the Gowrie Family under
</p>
<p>John, the third Earl, who was a younger son of the said
</p>
<p>William [the first Earl], possessed of wealth and power
</p>
<p>beyond the other nobility of the kingdom ; and, growing
</p>
<p>apprehensive," S:c. But the reader will be able to form a
</p>
<p>tolerable idea of Gowrie's actual wealth, when he knows,
</p>
<p>from the above facts, that he was in so embarrassed cir-

<p>cumstances, that he had actually to get a personal protec-

<p>tion for arrest from the Court of Session, on the 20th of

<p>sary for the King to examine him in person, as he
</p>
<p>(Gowrie) suspected him to be an emissary of Rome ;
</p>
<p>but this will be more particulary narrated in the
</p>
<p>sequel.
</p>
<p>When the Earl had sent his brother to Falk-
</p>
<p>land, which was early on a Tuesday morning, he
</p>
<p>proceeded to arrange his plans in Gowrie House.
</p>
<p>And the better to conceal his designs, as he was
</p>
<p>an " earnest professour, " he attended sermon in
</p>
<p>St John's Church in the morning, there having
</p>
<p>been always service in Perth every Tuesday and
</p>
<p>Thursday since the year 1393. There is a story
</p>
<p>told by the author of the Traditional Account, in-
</p>
<p>serted in the Memorabilia of Perth, about the Earl
</p>
<p>having on that day attended a marriage, " betw^een
</p>
<p>a young man of the name of Lamb, and a young
</p>
<p>woman called Bell, the daughter of a respectable
</p>
<p>citizen of Perth," when he received intelligence,
</p>
<p>" that the King, and a company with him, had
</p>
<p>come to his house, on which Earl Gowrie's coun-
</p>
<p>tenance changed, and he appeared to be a good
</p>
<p>deal perplexed ; and being asked by the bride's fa-
</p>
<p>ther, in whose house he was, what ailed him, he
</p>
<p>said, he was distressed for a dinner to the King
</p>
<p>and his retinue, who had come upon him unex-
</p>
<p>pectedly. Mr Bell urged him to accept of the
</p>
<p>dinner that was prepared for the wedding ; and, it
</p>
<p>is believed, he did accept of it." Now, this fool-
</p>
<p>ish and improbable story, which the worthy writer
</p>
<p>imagined to be a wonderful authority in support of
</p>
<p>his own hypothesis  namely, that James had gone
</p>
<p>to Perth purposely to murder Gowrie, is just the

<p>reverse. He tells us only a few sentences before,

<p>in the commencement of his traditionary (or fa-
</p>
<p>bulous) naiTative, that John, the third Earl of
</p>
<p>VI. THE GOWRIE CONSPIRACY. 289
</p>
<p>Gowrie, was " possessed of wealth and power be-
</p>
<p>yond the other nol)ility of the kingdom ; " and it
</p>
<p>is not likely, that his Lordship, if this were the
</p>
<p>fact, would deprive a common citizen of a dinner
</p>
<p>prepared for a special occasion, and get the whole
</p>
<p>eatables removed from the house of the said
</p>
<p>Mr Bell to Gowrie Palace, for the use of the
</p>
<p>King and his retinue, as if the inmates of Gowrie
</p>
<p>House had been previously on a limited allowance,
</p>
<p>and its pantry completely empty ; or as if every
</p>
<p>thing in Perth had been purchased for the marriage
</p>
<p>dinner, prepared by the said Mr Bell; nor yet had
</p>
<p>Gowrie any right to conclude that the King want-
</p>
<p>ed his dinner, and " to be a good deal perplexed"
</p>
<p>on that account, since, on the showing of the
</p>
<p>writer, he knew nothing at all of the King's move-
</p>
<p>ments, and, for any thing he knew, might have
</p>
<p>got only a passing call from James and his retinue.
</p>
<p>It accords rather ill with the Earl's so much boast-
</p>
<p>ed wealthy that he was compelled to be obliged to
</p>
<p>a common citizen for a dinner to the King, mere-
</p>
<p>ly, forsooth, because James " had come upon him
</p>
<p>unexpectedly ! " The story, which has lost nothing
</p>
<p>by tradition, has, however, some foundation in truth.
</p>
<p>Gowrie did not deprive Mr Bell of the wedding
</p>
<p>dinner, because he was not present at such an oc-
</p>
<p>casion, but in his state of excitement at the time,
</p>
<p>he was not remarkably well provided, and, it ap-
</p>
<p>peared afterwards, in the investigation of the rash
</p>
<p>enterprise, that he had sent some of his servants to
</p>
<p>purchase jtecessaries in the town, and the very shop,
</p>
<p>which had some pretensions to sell covfectionaries^
</p>
<p>was discovered where the purchases were made.

<p>ern boundary of the large garden pertaining to the

<p>VI. THE COWRIE CONSPIRACY. 291
</p>
<p>house. In the soutli-east corner of the garden
</p>
<p>stood the Monks' Tower, washed by the river,
</p>
<p>which was connected with the town-wall, the ori-
</p>
<p>gin of the name of which Tower is thus conjec-
</p>
<p>tured by the late Rev. Mr Scott, with more sim-
</p>
<p>plicity than ingenuity. " The monks, " says he,
</p>
<p>" who had been disorderly, were sometimes con-
</p>
<p>fined here, in order to do penance ; "  a conjecture
</p>
<p>not very probable, as it respects the name. * To
</p>
<p>the west of the Monks' Tower, beyond the street
</p>
<p>now called Canal Street, stood the ancient and
</p>
<p>strong-built Spey or Spy Tower  a fort which
</p>
<p>guarded the south gate of tlie town. The town-
</p>
<p>wall extended due west and east from the Spey
</p>
<p>Tower to the Monks' Tower ; and it is supposed,
</p>
<p>that at the time of this memorable event, the
</p>
<p>greatest part of the ground between South Street
</p>
<p>and the town-wall was appropriated for gardens.
</p>
<p>The House or Palace formed nearly a square,
</p>
<p>the most modern part being on the north and west.
</p>
<p> Statistical Account of Scotland, vol. xviif. p. 529.
</p>
<p>It is there added, that in the 17th century, " the Earl of
</p>
<p>Kinnoul, who was Cliancellor of Scotland, and possessed
</p>
<p>Cowrie House and garden, built the uppermost room of
</p>
<p>this tower to be a summer-house. " The above conjecture,
</p>
<p>however, of the author of the Statistical Account, is merely
</p>
<p>hypothetical. The Monks' Tower was built in 1336, by
</p>
<p>the command of Edward I., at the expense of the monas-
</p>
<p>teries of Lindoris, Balmerinoch, Aberbrothick, and Cu-
</p>
<p>par Angus ; and Fordun says, tliat the expense almost
</p>
<p>ruined those monasteries. Hence, some have supposed,

<p>says Grose (Antiquities, vol. ii. p. 2-i.3. ), that it received

<p>its appellation from that circumstance. Fordun also add<,

<p>that John de Gowrie, prior of St Andrew's, paid 280
</p>
<p>merks towards its erection. The Monks' Tower seems
</p>
<p>to have been used as a banqueting-house, and was, after

<p>magazine for gunpowder, connected with the artillery.

</p>
<p>That part in which the conspiracy was attempted,
</p>
<p>was on the south and east. The princif>al stair-
</p>
<p>case was in the south-east angle of the court, and
</p>
<p>there was another smaller one, called in the depo-
</p>
<p>sitions of the witnesses the Black Turnpike. *
</p>
<p>The principal building contained two stories or
</p>
<p>flats, besides the kitchen and other offices on the
</p>
<p>ground floor, and the attics. The apartments of
</p>
<p>the family, and the bed-rooms, were chiefly in the
</p>
<p>eastern division, and were surmounted on the
</p>
<p>north by two turrets.
</p>
<p>The windows of the dining-room looked into
</p>
<p>the garden, and commanded a splendid view of
</p>
<p>the river Tay, and the glorious scenery which
</p>
<p>adorns its banks. The principal hall was no-
</p>
<p>ble and spacious, and communicated with the
</p>
<p>ordinary hall, and with the great staircase which
</p>
<p>led to the courtyard. On the east side of the
</p>
<p>hall, on the right, was a door which communi-
</p>
<p>cated with the dining-room, and led to the gar-
</p>
<p>den. The greater part of the second floor, above
</p>
<p>these apartments, consisted of a gallery, which
</p>
<p>extended over all that part of the first floor oc-
</p>
<p>cupied by the hall and dining-room. This *' fair

</p>
<p>in a corner on the right, was the staircase leading
</p>
<p>down from it to the court called the Black Turn-
</p>
<p>pike. There was also a turret in the south-west
</p>
<p>corner of the chamber, in which, if it was built
</p>
<p>like the other turrets, there must have been two
</p>
<p>windows opposite each other, the one looking into

</p>
<p>of Govvrie House is taken from the first and only volume
</p>
<p>hitherto published of the Perth Antiquarian Society's

<p>Transactions, in which the description is accompanied by

<p>part of it in which the atfray took place. It may be here
</p>
<p>mentioned, that after Gowrie's confiscation his estate be-
</p>
<p>came the property of the town of Perth. Before the
</p>
<p>year 174.5, the house frequently changed masters, but at
</p>
<p>that time it was again in the hands of the town, and the
</p>
<p>worthy Whig Town-Council of Perth, in the excess of
</p>
<p>their loyalty, thought proper to present it to a personage
</p>
<p>whose memory Scotland has no great occasion to venerate,

<p>On the evening of the 4th of August, which
</p>
<p>liappened to be a Monday, Gowrie summoned
</p>
<p>Alexander Henderson, chamberlain of Scoon, one
</p>
<p>of his domestics, to attend him at Gowrie House on
</p>
<p>particular business. Henderson went accordingly,
</p>
<p>and was ushered into an apartment, where he
</p>
<p>found the Earl and his brother Alexander Ruth-
</p>
<p>ven. The former asked him what he intended to
</p>
<p>do on the following day ; to which Henderson re-
</p>
<p>plied, that he proposed liding to Ruthven (now
</p>
<p>called Hunting Tower), to look after the tenants.
</p>
<p>" No, " said Gowrie, " you must ride with my
</p>
<p>brother to Falkland, and when he sends you back,

<p>see that you return with all diligence, if he send

<p>pating a visit of this nature from either of the
</p>
<p>Gowries, on the follovvini^ morning, Tuesday, Au-
</p>
<p>gust 5th, a hunt was to take place in the parks of
</p>
<p>Falkland, and the royal party was on the point of
</p>
<p>proceeding to the spot, when Alexander Ruthven
</p>
<p>arrived at Falkland. He had left Perth in com-
</p>
<p>pany with Henderson, and a relative named An-
</p>
<p>drew Ruthven, at four o'clock in the morning, and
</p>
<p>arrived at Falkland at seven. Having proceeded
</p>
<p>to a retired house or " lodging, " near the palace,
</p>
<p>Alexander Ruthven sent Henderson to ohserve the
</p>
<p>movements of the King, who soon returned, and
</p>
<p>informed Ruthven, that his Majesty was setting
</p>
<p>out for the chase. Ruthven immediately proceed-
</p>
<p>ed to the party, and found the King in the act of
</p>
<p>mounting his horse, his attendants with their horses,
</p>
<p>and the huntsmen with their hounds, suiTounding
</p>
<p>the King on the lawn or green. Ruthven made a
</p>
<p>low oheisance on his knee, and desired to have a
</p>
<p>moment's private conversation with the King, on
</p>
<p>an affair which he pretended was of great import-
</p>
<p>ance. James, whose curiosity was always remark-
</p>
<p>able, perceiving young Ruthven's apparently ear-
</p>
<p>nest and serious demeanour, felt considerably in-
</p>
<p>terested, and allowed himself to be drawn aside.
</p>
<p>Having thus excited the curiosity of the King,
</p>
<p>Ruthven informed him, that, in an evening walk,
</p>
<p>he had met a suspicious looking person, his face
</p>
<p>almost concealed by a cloak, lurking about the
</p>
<p>by-paths and suburbs of the town ; and on ques-
</p>
<p>tioning him as to his name, his occupation, and
</p>
<p>what his intentions were in thus lurking about in
</p>
<p>unfrequented paths, he hesitated, and appeared

<p>confused ;  that he then examined his person
</p>
<p>closely, and perceived something concealed under

<p>296 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>his cloak, which he discovered to he a quantity of
</p>
<p>gold in a pot or jar, consisting of various coined
</p>
<p>pieces ;  that at this discovery, he secured the per-
</p>
<p>son, who, it was pretended, was a Jesuit, and had
</p>
<p>got him privately into Gowrie House, without the
</p>
<p>knowledge of any individual, where he had se-
</p>
<p>cured him till his Majesty's pleasure was known ;
</p>
<p>and he requested that the King would proceed
</p>
<p>forthwith to Perth as privately as possible, and
</p>
<p>examine the man, who was at that time confined
</p>
<p>in Gowrie House, without the knowledge even of
</p>
<p>his own brother.
</p>
<p>James, " curious by nature, and sufficiently in-
</p>
<p>digent to be inquisitive after money, " * felt some-
</p>
<p>what interested in this plausible story, more espe-
</p>
<p>cially as it was told with great apparent earnest-
</p>
<p>ness and sincerity. He thanked Ruthven, but
</p>
<p>observed, that he would not meddle in the matter,
</p>
<p>as he could deprive no man of his property, nor
</p>
<p>did the treasure appertain to the King, unless, ac-
</p>
<p>cording to the law, it had been found hid under
</p>
<p>ground. To this Ruthven replied, that this was
</p>
<p>of no consequence, for the man had confessed to
</p>
<p>him that he intended to hide it, but that he had
</p>
<p>no leisure to inquire minutely on the subject. The
</p>
<p>King still scrupled at this logic ; and Ruthven
</p>
<p>immediately replied, that he thought his Majesty
</p>
<p>too hesitating in a matter which might tend so
</p>
<p>much to his advantage and profit, but that if he
</p>
<p>refused to have any concern in it, it was very pro-
</p>
<p>bable that his brother the Earl and some others
</p>
<p>would make it a business of their own, and thus
</p>
<p>lieprive him of no inconsiderable sum of money

<p>whicli lie mi^ht otherwise have possessed. The
</p>
<p>Kiiit^'s curiosity was now roused ; and conceiv-
</p>
<p>ing that the man might be a Jesuit in disguise,
</p>
<p>sent as an emissary from some Popish kingdom on
</p>
<p>the Continent, to excite disturbances in tlie coun-
</p>
<p>try, by endeavouring to corrupt or bribe some of
</p>
<p>the nobles (a procedure of which James had suffi-
</p>
<p>cient experience previously), he asked Ruthven
</p>
<p>what kind of money it was, and the appearance of
</p>
<p>the man in whose possession he had discovered it.
</p>
<p>To this Ruthven replied, that he had not had
</p>
<p>Butficient time to examine it, but the money
</p>
<p>appeared to consist of foreign pieces ; and that al-
</p>
<p>though the man was evidently a Scotsman, he had
</p>
<p>never, to his knowledge, seen him before. This
</p>
<p>reply confirmed the King that the money must
</p>
<p>have been sent from some foreign Papists, and
</p>
<p>that the man was most likely a Scottish Jesuit or
</p>
<p>Seminary Priest, from one of the Scottish Col-
</p>
<p>leges on the Continent, to whom it had been
</p>
<p>intrusted as the person most capable of furthering
</p>
<p>the object in view.
</p>
<p>This story of the man with the gold, which
</p>
<p>Alexander Ruthven told the King, is not so im-
</p>
<p>probable, nor was the King so foolish for believing
</p>
<p>it, as many assert. Nor yet is the freedom which
</p>
<p>Ruthven used, although he was said to be out of
</p>
<p>his wits, * that is, deranged, is at all extraordinary.
</p>
<p>His connection with the court, and the office he
</p>
<p>held in it, brought him often into the King's pre-
</p>
<p>sence ; and indeed it is asserted, that he was pur-
</p>
<p>posely commissioned by his brother as a sort of han-
</p>
<p>ger on there to convey to him intelligence, which

<p>he could easily do, on account of his ewn situation
</p>
<p>and that of his sister Beatrice, who was one of the
</p>
<p>Maids of Honour. I reject, of course, Mr Pinker-
</p>
<p>ton's argument, that there was an intrigue between
</p>
<p>Alexander Ruthven and the Queen, and that
</p>
<p>James was stimulated by jealousy (with which, by
</p>
<p>the way, he was never much troubled) to destroy
</p>
<p>the Gowrie family. But the traditionary stories
</p>
<p>which the supporters of that theory maintain to
</p>
<p>be the evidence of the fact, certainly prove that
</p>
<p>young Ruthven was a favourite at court, and was
</p>
<p>accustomed to indulge in considerable freedom of
</p>
<p>speech. It would be rash, perhaps, to maintain
</p>
<p>that no intrigue existed between Ruthven and the
</p>
<p>Queen ; but it is evident, that even the doubtful
</p>
<p>traditions, originating from unknown authorities, do
</p>
<p>not establish the alleged fact. It appears, there-
</p>
<p>fore, that since James expressed no surprise at
</p>
<p>Ruthven's visit, nor at his story, that he was ac-
</p>
<p>customed to the familiarity of the Master ; and it
</p>
<p>must be observed, that the manners of the court,
</p>
<p>and of courtiers towards their sovereign, pai'took
</p>
<p>not of the refined politeness of modern times. But
</p>
<p>the story was calculated to make a very great im-
</p>
<p>pression on James, whose thoughts immediately
</p>
<p>reverted to the intrigues of the Seminary Priests.
</p>
<p>And that James had good cause to dread the in-
</p>
<p>trigues of foreign papists, is placed beyond a doubt.
</p>
<p>It was only in 1592, that the Earl of Both well and
</p>
<p>the Master of Gray had assaulted the King in the pa-
</p>
<p>lace of Falkland, those two personages being in the
</p>
<p>interest of the Court of Spain, who, exasperated at the

<p>as rebels, on account of their connection with

</p>
<p>The King gave implicit credit to Ruthven's
</p>
<p>tale, but proposed that he should send one of his
</p>
<p>own servants to Perth, with the Master, in order
</p>
<p>to receive both the pretended Jesuit and the
</p>
<p>money ; but to this Ruthven stoutly objected, pro-
</p>
<p>testing, that if his brother, or the magistrates of
</p>
<p>the town, knew any thing of the matter, the King
</p>
<p>would have a very bad chance for a share. Ruth-
</p>
<p>ven farther declared, that the only thing which
</p>
<p>induced him to ride straightway to Falkland and
</p>
<p>apprise his Majesty, was the very great love and
</p>
<p>affection he bore towards his sovereign, and the
</p>
<p>zeal he had for his service.
</p>
<p>This and similar discourse took place " before
</p>
<p>the stables " at Falkland, * during which time, the
</p>
<p>huntsmen had mounted, the buck had started, and
</p>
<p>the sport was about to commence ; but the King
</p>
<p>was so well pleased with Ruthven, that he fre-
</p>
<p>quently leaned on him, and "clapped him on the
</p>
<p>shoulder, " exciting considerable interest among
</p>
<p>the attendants. At length James, seeing every
</p>
<p>thing ready, told Ruthven that he would consider
</p>
<p>of it during the hunt, and determine when it was
</p>
<p>over. This was by no means pleasing to Ruth-
</p>
<p>ven, who remonstrated at the delay, more espe-
</p>
<p>cially as the King would have a good opportunity
</p>
<p>to investigate the business without attracting any
</p>
<p>notice if he set out instantly, as " the wliole town
</p>
<p>would be at the sermon." But the King mounted

<p>his horse, and the hunt commenced. Ruthven,

<p>however, who saw that he had made some impres-

</p>
<p>told Andrew Henderson, one of his attendants, to
</p>
<p>ride to Perth with all the speed he could make, as
</p>
<p>he loved the Earl of Gowrie, and inform him that

<p>he hoped he would prevail with the King to be at

<p>to which Ruthven replied, " No, stay a little, and

<p>follow me while I speak with his Majesty again."

<p>there were only a very few of the royal attendants
</p>
<p>present, James informed him that he had at length
</p>
<p>resolved to ride to Perth after the hunt. On this
</p>
<p>intimation, Ruthven ordered Henderson to depart
</p>
<p>with the utmost speed, and inform his brother of
</p>
<p>the King's resolution.
</p>
<p>Henderson immediately departed, and in the
</p>
<p>meantime the hunt continued. It lasted from a-
</p>
<p>bout seven in the morning till after eleven ; during
</p>
<p>which time Alexander Ruthven scarcely left the
</p>
<p>Kirg for a moment, continually exhorting him
</p>
<p>to finish the chase, that they might get " the
</p>
<p>sooner to St Johnfetoun. " The stag being killed,

</p>
<p>ly to Perth, as he had some business with the Earl
</p>
<p>of Gowrie. Lennox and his friends immediately
</p>
<p>sent for fresh horses, and their swords ; but the
</p>
<p>King^ took no sword with him, observing that he
</p>
<p>intended merely to ride to Perth, and would be
</p>
<p>back before the evening. While Lennox and the
</p>
<p>others were changing their horses, Kuthven got
</p>
<p>into conversation with the King, and was still ad-
</p>
<p>dressing him, when Lennox rode up. By this
</p>
<p>time they were on their journey, some of the at-
</p>
<p>tendants having changed their horses, while others,
</p>
<p>who rode back to Falkland for that purpose, did
</p>
<p>not overtake the King till he was within a few
</p>
<p>miles of Perth ; and it was imagined by many of
</p>
<p>them, that the object of the King's expedition was
</p>
<p>to apprehend the Master of Oliphant, who had
</p>
<p>been recently exciting disturbances in Forfarshire.
</p>
<p>During the progress of the royal party, the
</p>
<p>King rode aside to the Duke of Lennox, and said
</p>
<p>to him, in his usual colloquial style, " Ye cannot
</p>
<p>guess, man, what errand I am riding for : I am
</p>
<p>going to get s. pose * at Perth, and Mr Alexander
</p>
<p>Kuthven tells me that he has found a man who
</p>
<p>has a pot full of gold of divers coins. " The King
</p>
<p>then asked Lennox what manner of person he con-
</p>
<p>ceived Alexander Kuthven to be, who answered,
</p>
<p>that he " knew nothing of him, but thought him
</p>
<p>an lionest and discreet young gentleman. " The
</p>
<p>King now began to tell Lenox the history of the
</p>
<p>pose^ when the Duke answered, " I like not that,
</p>
<p>your Majesty, it is not likely. " Kuthven, how-
</p>
<p>ever, who had perceived, with great uneasiness,

<p>the King and Lennox conversing together, and

<p>had already expressed himself dissatisfied that so
</p>
<p>many attendants followed, now rode up to them,
</p>
<p>and earnestly requested the King to inform no one
</p>
<p>of the business, nor suffer any one to go with him
</p>
<p>till he had seen the man, and his treasure.
</p>
<p>According to the account of this enterprise, pub-
</p>
<p>lished by authority, Riithven's conduct on the road
</p>
<p>bad excited some suspicions in James, more especi-
</p>
<p>ally as Ruthven appeared peculiarly uneasy at the
</p>
<p>presence of Lennox and Mar. James therefore
</p>
<p>informed him, that he would trust the Duke and
</p>
<p>the Earl in more important matters than the pre-
</p>
<p>sent, and in a jocular manner observed, that, as he
</p>
<p>was *' a bad teller of money, he behoved to have
</p>
<p>some one with him to help in that business." Ruth-
</p>
<p>ven's reply was, " that he would suffer no one to
</p>
<p>see it first hut the King himself ; afterwai'ds, how-
</p>
<p>ever, be (the King) might call in whom he pleas-
</p>
<p>ed. " Nevertheless when the royal party were
</p>
<p>at the Bridge of Erne, the King whispered to the
</p>
<p>Duke, what had passed, but added " tak tent
</p>
<p>[[take heed] when I go with Alexander Ruthven,
</p>
<p>and be sure to follow me. " He made the same
</p>
<p>observation to Lennox, when they arrived at Gow-
</p>
<p>rie House.
</p>
<p>It was observed, that when the King had left
</p>
<p>Falkland behind for a few miles, Ruthven sent his
</p>
<p>other attendant, Andrew Ruthven, in great haste
</p>
<p>to Perth before him, to inform the Earl how far
</p>
<p>they were on their journey, and when they would
</p>
<p>airive. Henderson, the first courier, arrived in
</p>
<p>Perth about ten in the forenoon, where he found
</p>
<p>Gowrie anxiously waiting for him, in company

<p>with two persons of the name of Hay. Gowrie
</p>
<p>took him aside, and asked him what intelligence

<p>Vr. THE GOWRIE CONSPIRACY. 305
</p>
<p>he had brought from his brother, or if he had
</p>
<p>brought a letter. Henderson said he had brought
</p>
<p>no letter. " What answer then," asked Gowrie,
</p>
<p>" has he to me ? " Henderson replied, that he was
</p>
<p>commanded by his brother to inform his Lordship,
</p>
<p>that the King would be there anon, and that he
</p>
<p>was to prepare a dinner for his Majesty ; upon which
</p>
<p>Gowrie took him into a private apartment, and exa-
</p>
<p>mined him more closely. He asked him how the
</p>
<p>King had received his brother, and Henderson re-
</p>
<p>plied that it was in a kind manner, and that he had
</p>
<p>often laid his hand on his shoulder. Gowrie next
</p>
<p>asked how many persons were at the hunt. Hen-
</p>
<p>derson replied, that he could not exactly say, but
</p>
<p>there were some of his own friends, and some Eng-
</p>
<p>lishmen. He was next asked what noblemen were
</p>
<p>present, and he replied, that he saw none but " my
</p>
<p>Lord Duke." He was then dismissed, and order-
</p>
<p>ed to return to Gowrie- House within an hour,
</p>
<p>during which time his Lordship probably went to
</p>
<p>the sermon, or " exercise."
</p>
<p>At the time appointed, Henderson returned,
</p>
<p>and was admitted into Gowrie's presence, who or-
</p>
<p>dered him to put on a coat of mail and other ar-
</p>
<p>mour. Upon inquiring for what purpose, he receiv-
</p>
<p>ed from Gowrie the summary answer, " I have a
</p>
<p>Highlandman to secure in tlie Shoegate." Hender-
</p>
<p>son accordingly went to his own house, and, in obe-
</p>
<p>dience to his master's orders, arrayed himself in ar-
</p>
<p>mour, and returned to Gowrie- House about half past
</p>
<p>twelve o'clock, when he was ordered by the Earl
</p>
<p>to carry up his (the Earl's) dinner, on account of

</p>
<p>sat down to dinner in company with three geni-
</p>
<p>tlemen, John MonciiefF, Laird of Pitcrieff, James
</p>
<p>Dnimmond, and Alexander Peebles, Laird of
</p>
<p>Findoune. It was after the first service during
</p>
<p>which Henderson was in attendance, that Andrew
</p>
<p>Ruthven, who had left the King's retinue with a
</p>
<p>second message to Gowrie from his brother, en-
</p>
<p>tered the hall, as if lie had just dismounted, and
</p>
<p>whispered something to the Earl. Henderson
</p>
<p>soon after left the room, to bring up the second
</p>
<p>course ; and while he was doing so, Alexander
</p>
<p>Ruthven entered the diuing-hall.
</p>
<p>It is necessary here to return to the royal party,
</p>
<p>who were during this time on their progress to
</p>
<p>Perth. It will be recollected, that the hunt at
</p>
<p>Falkland was not finished till after eleven o'clock,
</p>
<p>and that the Earl sat down to dinner at half past
</p>
<p>twelve, consequently it would be between the hours
</p>
<p>of one and two when the King arrived. When
</p>
<p>the King was within a mile of Perth, Alexander
</p>
<p>Ruthven left the party, and rode on before, to ad-
</p>
<p>vertise the Earl of the King's approach.* He en-
</p>
<p>tered Gowrie House with a person named Blair,
</p>
<p>just as Henderson was ordering the second course ;
</p>
<p>and immediately the Earl, and those that were with

<p>him, rose from the table, f Henderson was desir^

<p>f As it cannot be denied, that Gowrie was at dinner in

<p>his own house when his brother arrived, it is surprising
</p>
<p>that some writers should have strenuously insisted on the

<p>that tlie King was at Perth, On the contrary, the Earl
</p>
<p>appears to have evinced the utmost coolness and self-pos-
</p>
<p>session. It is rather singnlar, that he did not delay his

<p>ed to put on his steel cap and gauntlet, though in
</p>
<p>complete ignorance of the purpose, except the ex-
</p>
<p>planation that Gowrie had formerly heeu pleased to
</p>
<p>give; for no one, it would appear, knew that the King
</p>
<p>was at hand, save the Earl and his brother. Gowrie
</p>
<p>now left his house, followed by Henderson ; but in-
</p>
<p>stead of directing his course to the Shoegate, he
</p>
<p>proceeded towards the plain or common termed the
</p>
<p>Inch, which was on the road to Falkland. On per-
</p>
<p>ceiving this, Henderson threw his gauntlet into the
</p>
<p>kitchen, on the ground floor of the building, and
</p>
<p>sent home his steel cap ; after which he followed
</p>
<p>the Earl to the Inch. There Gowrie met the
</p>
<p>King, Lennox, Mar, and the other royal attend-
</p>
<p>ants, and they all proceeded to Gowrie House.
</p>
<p>The Earl when he met the King, was attended by
</p>
<p>a number of persons on foot, between thirty and
</p>
<p>forty, whom he had collected for the purpose,
</p>
<p>among whom was Alexander Ruthven. The King's
</p>
<p>retinue hardly amounted to twenty in all.
</p>
<p>The Earl conducted the King into the hall, at-
</p>
<p>tended by Lennox, Mar, and others. The first

</p>
<p>counted for from the circumstance, that the three gentle-
</p>
<p>men who were with him might be unexpected visitors, and it
</p>
<p>was not his interest to appear as if there had been any plot
</p>
<p>in contemphition. It is worthy of remark, that one of
</p>
<p>these gentlemen, jMoncrieflT, Laird of Pitcriett", gave evi-
</p>
<p>dence against the F.arl ; and from his deposition it ap-
</p>
<p>pears, that Gowrie had excused himself from attending a
</p>
<p>meeting of the town-council that day, and, even after the
</p>
<p>appearance of his brother, theEarlhad never said that he ex-
</p>
<p>pected any person, though he must have known of theKing's

<p>approach from Henderson and Andrew Ruthven. Mon-

</p>
<p>thing James called for was somethinp^ to drink, as
</p>
<p>he was fatigued by his ride in a sultry day ; and
</p>
<p>it appears, from the evidence of the Duke of Len-
</p>
<p>nox, that it was not very expeditiously produced,
</p>
<p>probably on account of the confusion in the house,
</p>
<p>by the King's arrival. It was a full hour before
</p>
<p>dinner M^as ready. " The langsomeness of pre-
</p>
<p>paring the same, and badness of the cheer, " ob-
</p>
<p>serves the account published by authority, " being
</p>
<p>excused upon the sodeine comming of his Majestic."*
</p>
<p>While the dinner was in preparation, the King
</p>
<p>wished the Master to conduct him to the place
</p>
<p>where the pretended Jesuit was confined ; but he
</p>
<p>was told that it would be soon enough after din-
</p>
<p>ner, and this reply was accompanied by a recom-
</p>
<p>mendation not to appear over anxious about it,
</p>
<p>lest it should excite suspicion. From the Earl,
</p>
<p>the King, though he addressed him on various sub-
</p>
<p>jects, " could get no direct answer of him, but
</p>
<p>only halfe wordes, and imperfect sentences. "
</p>
<p>The dinner was at length produced, during
</p>
<p>which time the Earl was observed in a thoughtful
</p>
<p>state, frequently whispering to the servant, and
</p>
<p> Patrick Galloway, a very excellent clergyman, in his
</p>
<p>sermon preached at the Cross of Edinburgh on the occasion,
</p>
<p>thus speaks of the dinner the King got from Gowrie. " The

<p>King gets his dinner, a cold dinner, yea, a veiy cold din-

<p>sometimes going in and out of the room. The
</p>
<p>King dined in the principal dining-room, the en-
</p>
<p>trance to which was hy the main staircase. This
</p>
<p>room, as has already been mentioned, was in the
</p>
<p>south-east corner of the buihling on tlie first floor,
</p>
<p>and its windows looked into the garden and com-
</p>
<p>manded a view of the river. Adjoining to it was
</p>
<p>the hall, at the north-west side of which, near a
</p>
<p>large apartment, not destined to any particular
</p>
<p>use, was the Black Turvpike^ leading into the
</p>
<p>court-yard. In this hall, it appears that Lennox
</p>
<p>and others of the King's attendants dined when
</p>
<p>the dessert was on the King's table.
</p>
<p>No sooner had the King sat down to dinner,
</p>
<p>than Alexander Ruthven asked Henderson, for
</p>
<p>the key of the gallery-chamber, which was on the
</p>
<p>second floor, extending above the dining-room and
</p>
<p>great hall. Henderson said, that he had not seen
</p>
<p>it since his Lordship had come home ; but the
</p>
<p>Master told him to get it from William Rhynd,
</p>
<p>which he did, and gave it to Ruthven, who de-
</p>
<p>parted with it. Meanwhile, Henderson, it would
</p>
<p>appear, waited on the King as one of the do-
</p>
<p>mestics, until the Earl told him in a whisper to
</p>
<p>go to the gallery-cliamber to his brother. He
</p>
<p>proceeded thither, followed by the Earl through
</p>
<p>the " fair gallery "^ to the chamber, where they
</p>
<p>found the Master. Here Gowrie told Henderson
</p>
<p>to remain with his brother, and to do as he order-
</p>
<p>ed him ; then left the apartment, and returned
</p>
<p>to the King. Henderson now inquired what the
</p>
<p>Master wanted him to do, when the latter said,
</p>
<p>" You must go in Iiere, and remain till I come

</p>
<p>pointed to the turret, which was^ at^the north-

<p>310 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>west corner of the apartment. No sooner had
</p>
<p>Henderson got into this turret, than he was locked
</p>
<p>up by the Master. *
</p>
<p>Let us now return to the first-floor. The King-
</p>
<p>had finished his dinner, and was rising from the
</p>
<p>table, when the Master entered the dining-hall,
</p>
<p>and whispered in his ear, that it was now time
</p>
<p>to go and examine the treasure ; but that he want-
</p>
<p>ed to get quit of the Earl, his brother, and beg-
</p>
<p>ed his Majesty would send him into the hall, to
</p>
<p>entertain his guests. The King now called for a
</p>
<p>pledging cup, and observed jocularly to the Earl,
</p>
<p>that although he had seen the customs of other
</p>
<p>countries, yet he (the King) would teach him a
</p>
<p>Scottish custom, as he was a " Scottish man ;" for
</p>
<p>since he had forgotten to pledge his sovereign,
</p>
<p>and had not sat with his guests at table, he (the
</p>
<p>King) would pledge his own welcome. Gowrie
</p>
<p>was then desired to go into the hall, and pledge
</p>
<p>the company. The King now left the dining-room,
</p>
<p>and proceeded through the hall, where his atten-
</p>
<p>dants were drinking, and as he passed, he desired
</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Erskine to follow him, but this was
</p>
<p>forbidden by the Master. The King was then led
</p>
<p>by the Master up the Black Turnjnke to the gal-
</p>
<p>lery-chamber, the latter taking care to lock every
</p>
<p>door behind him, till he came to the gallery, the
</p>
<p>door of which remained open ; and he was over-
</p>
<p>heard to say, as he locked these doors  *' Now I
</p>
<p>have him secure, 1 think." He was at last led to
</p>
<p>the turret^ in which Henderson was placed, the door
</p>
<p>of which being unlocked by the Master, the King
</p>
<p> Henderson says in his second deposition, that he now

<p>pntered leaning on his arm, where the first object
</p>
<p>he saw was Henderson in complete armour, and
</p>
<p>was perfectly astounded at the sight. The door
</p>
<p>was now locked by the Master, who putting on his
</p>
<p>hat, and, turning fiercely on the King, said, " Sir,
</p>
<p>you are my prisoner ; remember my father s death.
</p>
<p>Submit to me without resistance or outcry, or this
</p>
<p>dagger shall instantly avenge my father's death ;"
</p>
<p>and he snatched Henderson's dagger, and present-
</p>
<p>ed it to the King's heart. * Astonished and ter-
</p>
<p>rified at this sudden attack, the King attempted
</p>
<p>to speak ; hut was interrupted by Ruthven. " Hold
</p>
<p>your tongue, Sir," said he, " or by Christ you
</p>
<p>shall die ! " The King was without a weapon of
</p>
<p>any kind, and had merely his hunting-horn sus-
</p>
<p>pended from liis breast ; but he at length said
</p>
<p>to Ruthven, " Mr Alexander, you and I were
</p>
<p>very great [intimate,] together, and as for your
</p>
<p>father's death, man, 1 was then a minor, and
</p>
<p>my council would have done what they pleas-
</p>
<p>ed: f And farther, man, although you bereave
</p>
<p>me of my life, ye will not be King of Scotland,
</p>
<p>for I have both sons and daughters, and there
</p>
<p>are those in this town who will not leave it unre-
</p>
<p>venged." According to the King's account, he also
</p>
<p>reminded Ruthven how he had not only restored
</p>
<p>to his family " al their landes and dignities, but
</p>
<p>* Henderson, in his first deposition, says, that lie threw
</p>
<p>the da^iger out of the IMaster's hand, otherwise tlie King
</p>
<p>would certainly have been slain. He omits this fact in his
</p>
<p>second ; but it is of little consequence, and does not in-
</p>
<p>validate his general testimony, which, fortunately, he gave

<p>" Why do not you take off your hat, " which

<p>said the King, " bring hitlier your brothei'. " In

<p>Durin<? this time, and while the King was in
</p>
<p>this distracting situation, his attendants below
</p>
<p>were heconiing impatient. Cowrie had gone into
</p>
<p>the hail, as he was desired by the King ; and when
</p>
<p>the King's lieaith was pledged, Lennox rose to
</p>
<p>follow him, as he had been commanded ; but he
</p>
<p>was told by tlie Earl, that his Majesty ivas gone
</p>
<p>quietly vpon some private errand. Calling for the
</p>
<p>key of the garden, he conducte(i his guests thither
</p>
<p>by a staircase, which led, l.>y a flight of steps from
</p>
<p>the south-east corner of the hall, adjoining the
</p>
<p>dining-room, into tlie garden. By this manoeuvre,
</p>
<p>he conducted them to a different quarter altoge-
</p>
<p>ther from that part of the large building in which
</p>
<p>was the King, they being at the east, and he be-
</p>
<p>ing in the south-west angle of the house. As the
</p>
<p>King had declared that he was to return to Falk-
</p>
<p>land that night, they had all their liorses in readi-
</p>
<p>ness ; and while they were in the garden, one Cran-
</p>
<p>stoun, a friend of Cowrie, who was afterwards ex-
</p>
<p>ecuted for this desperate enterprise, came to them,
</p>
<p>and informed them that the King had gone to
</p>
<p>Falkland ; upon which ihey all nished, with Cow-
</p>
<p>rie, up the flight of steps into the hall, and, cross-
</p>
<p>ing it, ran down the staircase into the court-yard 
</p>
<p>calling for their horses. Cowrie also exclaimed,
</p>
<p>" Horse ! horse ! " when Cranstoun said to liim,
</p>
<p>" Your horse is at Scone ; " but Cowrie took no
</p>
<p>notice of this, continually exclaiming, " Horse !
</p>
<p>horse!" Here they were joined by the Earl of
</p>
<p>Mar, and Wemyss of Pittencrieft", Cowrie's bro-
</p>
<p>ther-in-law; for those two, instead of accompany-

<p>or turret where the King was locked up), and had
</p>
<p>remained there for some time, admiring its noble
</p>
<p>and spacious appearance. *
</p>
<p>Gowrie now said, " I am sure the King is al-
</p>
<p>ways first ; stay, my Lords, and drink, and I shall
</p>
<p>no into the house and ascertain if he be really
</p>
<p>gone." He then crossed the court or close, and went
</p>
<p>up the principal staircase ; but soon reappeared,
</p>
<p>telling them that the King had really gone forth
</p>
<p>to Falkland by the South Inch ; and, in the utmost
</p>
<p>hurry, called for their horses. By this time they
</p>
<p>were all near the front street, or Shoegate, be-
</p>
<p>fore the chief entrance to the house ; but some
</p>
<p>doubts having arisen, the Duke of Lennox asked
</p>
<p>Robert Christie, Gowrie's porter, if the King were
</p>
<p>really gone; to which he answered, " No." The Earl
</p>
<p>of Mar then said to the porter, " Billy [friend],
</p>
<p>tell me truly whether his Majesty is gone or not."
</p>
<p>Christie answered, " In truth, my Lord, he is not."
</p>
<p>Gowrie turned fiercely upon him, and said, " You
</p>
<p>lie, he went by the back gate, and across the
</p>
<p>Inch. " " My Lord, " replied the porter, " that
</p>
<p>cannot be, for I have the key of the back gate, and
</p>
<p>all the gates of the place, in my pocket. " They
</p>
<p>all went out of the gate, into the street, deliberat-
</p>
<p>ing and looking about for the King, when sudden-
</p>
<p>ly they heard a voice, as if proceeding from a strug-
</p>
<p>gle. " That is the King's voice, " said Lennox,
</p>
<p>" be where he will. "

</p>
<p>to the turret in tlie gallery-cljamber, where tlie
</p>
<p>Kintr was locked up, after the departure of the
</p>
<p>Master. No sooner had Ruthven left the turret
</p>
<p>with the intention of consultinp^ his brother, than
</p>
<p>the King turned to the man in armour, whom lie
</p>
<p>had never before seen, and who stood almost mo-
</p>
<p>tionless at the Master's outrageous conduct. " How
</p>
<p>came you here, man ? " asked the King. Hender-
</p>
<p>son replied, " As God lives, I am shot [thrust]
</p>
<p>in here like a dog, a short time before your Ma-
</p>
<p>jesty's coming." " Will my Lord of Gowrie do
</p>
<p>me any evil, man ? " asked the King. " I vow
</p>
<p>to God, " said Henderson, " I shall die first. "
</p>
<p>The King then desired Henderson to throw open
</p>
<p>one of the windows, and give the alarm ; and
</p>
<p>he accordingly ran to the one which looked to-
</p>
<p>wards the Speygiite ; but the King exclaimed,
</p>
<p>" Fie ! the wrong window, man ! " This ex-
</p>
<p>pression has been held by the sceptics in this
</p>
<p>enterprise, as quite conclusive that the plot was
</p>
<p>devised by the King, but when we recollect the
</p>
<p>situation of the tuiTet, and the direction of the
</p>
<p>windows, every objection is visionary. The one
</p>
<p>to which Henderson ran first, looked directly
</p>
<p>away from the court-yard or close where the King
</p>
<p>certainly wished to give the alarm, towards the
</p>
<p>Spey-gate, in the direction of the Spey or Spy
</p>
<p>Tower, whereas the other looked directly towards
</p>
<p>the quarter where assistance could alone be pro-
</p>
<p>cured. At the very moment when Henderson was
</p>
<p>attempting to open the right window, Alexander
</p>
<p>Ruthven entered the turret, and making towards
</p>
<p>the King, said, " By God ! there is no remedy :

</p>
<p>you must die ! " and having a (jarter or cord in his
</p>
<p>hand, he sprung upon the King with the intention
</p>
<p>316 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>to bind his hands. James was unarmed, yet he
</p>
<p>scorned to submit to that indignity, and, closing
</p>
<p>with the Master, a struggle endued. " I am a
</p>
<p>hee prince, man ! " he cried to Ruthven, *' I will
</p>
<p>not be bound. " While thus grappling with the
</p>
<p>assassin, he extricated his left hand, and Hen-
</p>
<p>derson pulled away the garter from Ruthven.
</p>
<p>The King " loupit free, " and made towards the
</p>
<p>window, but the Master again grappled him by the
</p>
<p>craig, (throat) with his left hand, and placed his
</p>
<p>right Jieeve (hand) on the King's mouth. Hender-
</p>
<p>son drew away his right hand from James' mouth,
</p>
<p>and, reaching over the King's shoulder, threw up
</p>
<p>the window ; and at this time the King's voice
</p>
<p>was heard in the court-yard below. When Ruth-
</p>
<p>ven perceived this, he exclaimed to Henderson,
</p>
<p>" Wo betide thee, villain ! is there no help
</p>
<p>from ye ? We shall all die. " He then attempt-
</p>
<p>ed to draw his sword ; but the King laid his
</p>
<p>hands on the hilt, and grasped firmly the hands of
</p>
<p>Ruthven, who drew back from the window, drag-
</p>
<p>ging the King to the middle of the turret. During
</p>
<p>this struggle, Henderson ran, and unlocked the
</p>
<p>closet, and also the door of the gallery-chamber at
</p>
<p>the head of the Black Turnpike, which the Mas-
</p>
<p>ter had also secured ; and hearing a noise, and a
</p>
<p>rushing up the turnpike, he stood aside, the King
</p>
<p>and the Master still grappling each other.
</p>
<p>When the King's voice was first heard by Len-
</p>
<p>nox, Mar, and others, in the court-yard, all eyes
</p>
<p>turned to the quarter whence it proceeded. Look-
</p>
<p>ing up towards the window, they perceived the
</p>
<p>King wanting his hat, his face red, flushed, and a

<p>hand grasping his cheek and mouth. His cries
</p>
<p>were at that moment quite audible  " Treason !

</p>
<p>treason !  lielp, my Lord Mar, lielp ! help ! I am
</p>
<p>murdered I " and a general rush took place from
</p>
<p>the court- yard towards the house. The Duke of
</p>
<p>Lennox, Mar, and some others, ran up the great
</p>
<p>staircase towards the hall, hut there tiiey found
</p>
<p>the door secured. Seeing; a ladder, they got hold
</p>
<p>of it, and attempted to hurst open tlie door, hut
</p>
<p>it broke ; and though they sent for hammers, these
</p>
<p>were of no avail. James Erskine laid hands on
</p>
<p>Gowrie himself in the street, and Sir Thomas
</p>
<p>Erskine also grappled with him, saying, " Traitor !
</p>
<p>this is thy deed : thou shalt die ! " But Gowrie
</p>
<p>answered, " I know nothing of the matter. " A
</p>
<p>scuffle ensued, when the Earl, who carried two
</p>
<p>swords, or perhaps a dagger and sword, drew them
</p>
<p>both, exclaiming, " I will either be at my own
</p>
<p>house, or die at the gate ! " tlten followed by a
</p>
<p>number lie ran into the court-yard.
</p>
<p>While Lennox, Mar, and others, were battering
</p>
<p>the doors in the principal staircase, and assailing
</p>
<p>them with their utmost fury. Sir John Ramsay ran
</p>
<p>up the Black Turnpike, calling on Sir Thomas
</p>
<p>Erskine to follow him to the very top. Erskine
</p>
<p>was followed by Sir Hugh Herries, failed Dr Ilcr-
</p>
<p>rics, and others. Ramsay having ascended the turn-
</p>
<p>pike, and, forced open the door, f<uiid himselt in the
</p>
<p>gallery-chamber, the King struggling with Ruthven,
</p>
<p>and the man in armour standing at a distance mo-
</p>
<p>tionless. By this time Erskine, Herries, and others,
</p>
<p>had entered ; and Herries cried, " This is the trai-
</p>
<p>tor, strike him ! " Ramsay accordingly made towards
</p>
<p>Ruthven, when the King, exhausted by the struggle,
</p>
<p>said, " Strike him lai(/h [low], for he has ane pi/nc

<p>royal pages, had a hawk on his arm, but he cast
</p>
<p>the bird from him, drew his sword, and stabbed
</p>
<p>the Master twice, while the King, making an ex-
</p>
<p>ertion, threw him down the stairs of the turnpike.
</p>
<p>The rash youth fell, weltering in blood, exclaim-
</p>
<p>ing, " Alas ! I was not to blame for this matter. "
</p>
<p>His body was found by Erskine, Herries, and o-
</p>
<p>thers, who attacked him with their weapons, and
</p>
<p>speedily despatched him. During the confusion,
</p>
<p>Henderson took the opportunity to escape.
</p>
<p>At this very moment Gowrie appeared in the
</p>
<p>gallery-chamber, where the King had been res-
</p>
<p>cued, w^ith two swords in his hand, and a knap"
</p>
<p>scliaw or helmet on his head, preceded by his ser-
</p>
<p>vant Thomas Cranston, and some others. Erskine,
</p>
<p>Herries, and Ramsay, attempted to stop their en-
</p>
<p>trance when a scuffle ensued, during which Erskine
</p>
<p>was wounded in the right hand by Cranston;
</p>
<p>but Sir John Ramsay attacked the Earl, and
</p>
<p>stabbed him through the heart. Gowrie reeled,
</p>
<p>leaned on his sword, fell to the ground dead, and
</p>
<p>it was noted as a singular circumstance, that no
</p>
<p>blood came from his wound till his belt was re-
</p>
<p>moved ; in which, when his person was riffled for
</p>
<p>papers, there was found concealed a number of do-
</p>
<p>cuments containing magical characters. After the
</p>
<p>Earl fell, Cranston and the rest of his followers
</p>
<p>effected a retreat.
</p>
<p>The King, thus rescued from the assailants,
</p>
<p>descended from the apartment where the affray
</p>
<p>had happened. But no sooner was it known
</p>
<p>in Perth that Gowrie was slain, than multi-

</p>
<p>GowTie House ; some for the King's relief, o-
</p>
<p>thers attracted by the disturbance, and by the
</p>
<p>ringing of the town bell. The retainers of Gow-
</p>
<p>rie rioted on the streets for several hours in the
</p>
<p>evening, and even after the King's rescue, made
</p>
<p>" certain irreverent and undutiful speeches against
</p>
<p>his Majesty. " * Alexander Ruthven of Forgun,
</p>
<p>called out to the King, " Come down, thou son of
</p>
<p>Signior Davie [Rizzio] ; thou hast slain an honest-
</p>
<p>er man than thyself ;" and Craigengelt, exclaimed
</p>
<p>before the citizens, " Give us out our Provost, or
</p>
<p>the King's green coat shall pay for it. " The
</p>
<p>King, however, showed himself to the people from
</p>
<p>the famous turret, and, by repeated assurances of
</p>
<p>his safety, endeavoured to restrain the disorder.
</p>
<p>The town's-people, we are toki, knew nothing of
</p>
<p>the matter till the bell rang, but it would appear
</p>
<p>that the tidings of the affair had speedily reached
</p>
<p>Dundee; (twenty miles distant) ; for " the town of
</p>
<p>Dundee, being advertised, came all upon arms,
</p>
<p>thinking to have spoyled the burgh of Perth, but
</p>
<p>praised be God, the King knew the town of Perth's
</p>
<p>part to be free. " f
</p>
<p>The riot on the streets continued for some
</p>
<p>hours, principally excited by Gowrie's servants,
</p>
<p>who appear to have been well armed, and those
</p>
<p>of the citizens who were attached to him. While
</p>

<p>citizens of Perth, who were alleged to have heen

<p>Alexander Ruthven of Forgun was seen running

<p>up the Water-gate, and before the House, with a

<p>seven in the evening for Falkland, by a private
</p>
<p>door or gate towards the river, after having direct-
</p>
<p>ed the magistrates of Perth to take charge of the
</p>
<p>bodies of Gowrie and his brother. It was late
</p>
<p>in the evening when the King arrived at Falkland ;
</p>
<p>but no sooner was the fact communicated to the in-
</p>
<p>habitants, than they all turned out of their houses,
</p>
<p>and welcomed their sovereign by the greatest de-
</p>
<p>monstrations of joy and attachment. On the follow-
</p>
<p>ing day, August 6th, the privy-council in Edin-
</p>
<p>burgh received an express from the court, and no-
</p>
<p>thing could exceed the astonishment which perva-
</p>
<p>ded the kingdom, when this daring conspiracy was
</p>
<p>made known. In Edinburgh, in particular, the ci-
</p>
<p>tizens vied with each other in their expressions of
</p>
<p>loyalty for the King's deliverance. Cannons were
</p>
<p>fired, the houses were illuminated, bone- fires were
</p>
<p>lighted. On the top of Arthur's Seat a great fire
</p>
<p>was kindled ; the church-bells of the city sent
</p>
<p>forth their sonorous peals ; and all concurred in
</p>
<p>the public joy at the King's deliverance, save the
</p>
<p>ministers of Edinburgh, who not only refused to
</p>
<p>hold a public thanksgiving for the defeat of the
</p>
<p>enterprise, but even obstinately maintained, that

<p>there was no conspiracy at all.
</p>
<p>The King arrived at Edinburgh from Falkland
</p>
<p>322 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>on the 11th of August, and was joyfully received
</p>
<p>at Leith by a great concourse of people, and he
</p>
<p>now turned his attention towards an investiga-
</p>
<p>tion of the conspiracy.
</p>
<p>As Henderson had escaped from Gowrie House
</p>
<p>during the disturbance, and had not been recog-
</p>
<p>nised by any one, a free pardon and a consider-
</p>
<p>able reward were offered to the individual who
</p>
<p>would confess that he was the unknown person
</p>
<p>in the turret. Henderson immediately came for-
</p>
<p>ward, and acknowledged that he was the man.
</p>
<p>He was imprisoned, and retained as a witness in
</p>
<p>the future proceedings.
</p>
<p>On the 22d of August, a warrant was issued
</p>
<p>by the Justiciary Court, to bring Gowrie's three
</p>
<p>servants, George Craigengelt, Thomas Cranston,
</p>
<p>(brother of Sir John Cranston of that Ilk), and
</p>
<p>John Macduff, to trial at Perth. It appears
</p>
<p>that Cranston had been previously examined at
</p>
<p>Perth on the 6th of August, and Craigengelt at
</p>
<p>Falkland on the 16th. They were according-
</p>
<p>ly served with an indictment, and being found
</p>
<p>guilty as " airt and pairt'' in the conspiracy, were
</p>
<p>executed on the 23d of that month. The charge
</p>
<p>proved against them was, that they drew their
</p>
<p>swords in defence of Gowrie against the King,
</p>
<p>during the disorder at Gowrie House ; but they
</p>
<p>denied to the last that they had any knowledge of
</p>
<p>the conspiracy. On the 20th of August, a pre-
</p>
<p>cognition of the conspiracy was taken at Falkland,
</p>
<p>when Lennox, Mar, the Abbots of Inchaffray,
</p>
<p>and Lindores, Sir Thomas Erskine, Sir John
</p>
<p>Ramsay, Andrew Henderson, and twenty-five other

<p>witnesses, gave their depositions. On the 22d Sep-
</p>
<p>tember, an investigation was made at Perth in the
</p>
<p>VI. THE GOWRIE CONSPIRACY. 323
</p>
<p>" New Kirk, " by the magistrates and council, in
</p>
<p>obedience to the King's writ produced by Sir Ro-
</p>
<p>bert Melville and Sir David Murray. Almost
</p>
<p>every individual of any consequence in Perth, was
</p>
<p>summoned to attend this investigation. It continu-
</p>
<p>ed five days, and no fewer than three hundred and
</p>
<p>fifty-five persons were examined. They chiefly
</p>
<p>deponed to the riot on the streets, an account of
</p>
<p>which has already been given from their evidence.*
</p>
<p>It may be observed, that one Francis Tennent was
</p>
<p>executed in October for writing " pasquils " on the
</p>
<p>subject against the King, addressed to the well-
</p>
<p>known Robert Bruce and another preacher named
</p>
<p>Davidson. On the 1st of November, Gpwrie and
</p>
<p>Iiis brother were tried according to the Roman law,
</p>
<p>which held that persons guilty of high treason
</p>
<p>might be tried after death ; which practice was ex-
</p>
<p>tensively fel lowed by the Scots. Of course, it
</p>
<p>was a mere formality.
</p>
<p>The various acts of the government afterwards,
</p>
<p>it is needless to recapitulate. The family of Cow-
</p>
<p>rie, and various of their connections, were de-
</p>
<p>clared forfeited ; and the surname of Ruthven
</p>
<p>was ordered to be abolished forever. Andrew

<p>* Some of their depositions are curious. One declared
</p>
<p>that he '< was measuring coals all the time in the South Inch,"
</p>
<p>a second turned out " at the soond o' the bell, bot stayed
</p>
<p>not;" a third was, '* nocht that day in the toon,; " a
</p>
<p>fourth was, " nocht thair ; " a fifth " cam nocht ; " a sixth
</p>
<p>was *< sleeping at the time. " Some said they were at varia
</p>
<p>ous places in the country ; others were at the riot, but knew
</p>
<p>nothing about it ; others, again, were pursuing their own
</p>
<p>aftairs ; a few described themselves as " auld men, " and

<p>that they " couldna gang out;" some deponed that they
</p>
<p>were thair, but that they were ordered hamc by the magis-
</p>
<p>trates, who threatened to " break their hcids. " No far-
</p>
<p>ther explanations could be given of the matter.

</p>
<p>Henderson was set at liberty, and restored to his
</p>
<p>office of chamberlain or factor ; and, on the 19th
</p>
<p>of November, the bodies of the Earl and his
</p>
<p>brother were brought to Edinburgh, and hanged,
</p>
<p>drawn, and quartered, at the cross. Their heads
</p>
<p>wei'e set up in Edinburgh, Dundee, Perth, and
</p>
<p>Stirling; it was enacted, that it would be high
</p>
<p>treason for any person to intercede for the Gowrie
</p>
<p>family ; and the 5th day of August was appointed
</p>
<p>to be held ever afterwards as a day of public thanks-
</p>
<p>giving.
</p>
<p>Thus the matter rested, without any elucida-
</p>
<p>tion of the mystery, till nine years afterwards,
</p>
<p>when an accident as strange as the plot itself oc-
</p>
<p>curred. One George Sprot, a notary in Eye-
</p>
<p>mouth, having boasted among some of his friends,
</p>
<p>that he knew several particulars connected with
</p>
<p>the Gowrie Conspiracy, information was conveyed
</p>
<p>to George Home, Earl of Dunbar, who apprehend-
</p>
<p>ed him at the instance of the Lord Advocate. Af-
</p>
<p>ter having been repeatedly examined by the Privy
</p>
<p>Council, Sprot gave in a declaration that he knew
</p>
<p>perfectly of the conspiracy, and of the correspon-
</p>
<p>dence between Gowrie and Logan. On that oc-
</p>
<p>casion, the letters of Logan of Kestalrig, al-
</p>
<p>ready alluded to, were produced. *" Both Logan
</p>
<p>and his agent. Laird Bour, were dead, but the
</p>
<p>same course was taken against the former, as a-
</p>
<p>gainst Gowrie and his brother. His bones were
</p>
<p>* Sprot confessed that he had known both Logan and
</p>
<p>Laird Bour, from the latter of whom he had received the
</p>
<p>first intimation of the conspiracy. It is curious to remark,
</p>
<p>that Logan's letters to Gowrie, which were found in Sprot's

<p>(lug up ; he was tried for high IreaRon ; his estate
</p>
<p>was forfeited ; his posterity declared infamous. Jt
</p>
<p>does not appear that any proceedings were insti-
</p>
<p>tuted against Laird Bour, who was probahly too
</p>
<p>insignificant to attract attention. Sprot himself
</p>
<p>was hanged on the 12th of August 1G09, at the
</p>
<p>Cross of Edinburgh, and his head placed on the
</p>
<p>Tolbooth beside those of Gowrie and his brother.
</p>
<p>Archbishop Spottiswoode, Dr George Abbot, (af-
</p>
<p>terwards Archbishop of Canterbury), many noble-
</p>
<p>men, and the magistrates and ministers of Edin-
</p>
<p>burgh, were present at his execution. He conduct-
</p>
<p>ed himself on the scaffold with great penitence and
</p>
<p>devotion ; he informed the spectators tliat when
</p>
<p>he was thrown over the ladder, he would verify
</p>
<p>by a signal the truth of his confessions ; and ac-
</p>
<p>cordingly, he thrice clapped his hands when he
</p>
<p>was suspended on the gibbet.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, at tiie present day, we can reason
</p>
<p>and investigate facts, without those excitements
</p>
<p>of passion which characterized the turbulent and
</p>
<p>stormy reign of James iu Scotland. It has been
</p>
<p>conjectured, tliat there was perhaps a double plot
</p>
<p>on the part of the Ruthvens ; and it may be safely
</p>
<p>concluded, that while the Master seems to have
</p>
<p>been stimulated by a determination to revenge his
</p>
<p>father's death, with Gowrie himself it was evident-
</p>
<p>ly a wild scheme of unprincipled and ill-concerted
</p>
<p>ambition ; and, tliough it would be rash to maintain
</p>
<p>that they intended to slay the King, they cannot he
</p>
<p>freed from the charge of concerting violence on his
</p>
<p>person. Indeed since the authenticity of Logan's
</p>
<p>letters are now placed beyond all question, it cannot

<p>be doubted, that the first object of tlie Earl and his
</p>
<p>brother was to secure the person of the King, by
</p>
<p>326 CONSPIRACIES.
</p>
<p>conveying him to Fastcastle, that the whole influ-
</p>
<p>ence of the Crown might be transferred into their
</p>
<p>hands.
</p>
<p>But never was there a charge more atrocious,
</p>
<p>I would observe, in concluding this nanative, than
</p>
<p>that of ascribing to James the invention of the
</p>
<p>plot in order to accomplish the niin of the Ruthven
</p>
<p>family. " Besides the placability and gentleness of
</p>
<p>his disposition, " observes Sir Walter Scott, " and
</p>
<p>besides the consideration, that no adequate motive
</p>
<p>can be assigned, or even conjectured, for his per-
</p>
<p>petrating such an inhospitable murder, it ought to
</p>
<p>be recollected, that the King was naturally timor-
</p>
<p>ous, and could not even look at a drawn sword
</p>
<p>without shuddering ; so that it is contrary to all
</p>
<p>reason and probability to suppose that he could
</p>
<p>be the deviser of a scheme in which his life was
</p>
<p>repeatedly exposed to the most imminent danger."
</p>
<p>*' It has become fashionable, " says Mr Pitcairn,
</p>
<p>" to ridicule the pusillanimity of James VI. ; but
</p>
<p>it is hard to conceive how far the bravest man could
</p>
<p>have here surpassed him in courage, or could have
</p>
<p>displayed more coolness and address than did the
</p>
<p>King, throughout all this transaction. Although
</p>
<p>constitutionally and habitually timid, and this weak-
</p>
<p>ness aggravated in no small degree by the constant
</p>
<p>broils and conspiracies in which he was involved,
</p>
<p>James, on many occasions, showed, when per-
</p>
<p>sonally placed in difficult emergencies, that he was
</p>
<p>not unworthy of the royal blood from which he
</p>
<p>was descended. "
