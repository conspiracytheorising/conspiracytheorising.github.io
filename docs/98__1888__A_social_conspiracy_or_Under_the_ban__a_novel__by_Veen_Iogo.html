</p>
<p>CHAPTER I.
</p>
<p>In a grandeur-vaunted city,
</p>
<p>Where the water giant glides
</p>
<p>Like a belt of burnished silver
</p>
<p>Through a gorge in its rocky sides,
</p>
<p>Where the pictured hills and valleys
</p>
<p>Dotted are with palace homes,
</p>
<p>The blue arch of heaven bending
</p>
<p>Down to meet her climbing domes,
</p>
<p>Named for a saint in glory,
</p>
<p>Worshipping a golden god,
</p>
<p>Cluster, 'mong her oak trees hoary,
</p>
<p>Castles proud to gem her sod.
</p>
<p>Tapering towers throng her air-lofts,
</p>
<p>Shimmering like swords of fire
</p>
<p>Brandished by cohorts of churches
</p>
<p>Challenging high heaven's ire !
</p>
<p>Pity, O Christ, the mock worship
</p>
<p>Breathed in Thy consecrate aisles,
</p>
<p>With Love and Charity banished,
</p>
<p>And hatred dressed up in their smiles.
</p>
<p>The earth lay like a flower garden, 'neath her June
</p>
<p>tent of unclouded blue. The sun, midway on its de-
</p>
<p>scent, threw slant bars of gold along the deep river
</p>
<p>banks, flooding the low, projecting wharves with
</p>
<p>sheets of splendor.
</p>
<p>Upon one of these deserted berths, seemingly
</p>
<p>afloat, so nearly parallel was it to the water's surface,
</p>
<p>two little girls were playing. That they had escaped
</p>
<p>the vigilant eye of their attendant, or that they were

<p>4 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>representatives of a multitude of unattended street
</p>
<p>waifs, the nurslings of Mother Earth and Father
</p>
<p>Chance, might have explained their unprotected
</p>
<p>condition, but for their bright, frank faces and their
</p>
<p>fresh, sweet wardrobes, the unmistakable insignia of
</p>
<p>loving maternal watch- care.
</p>
<p>A stranger might have passed the younger of these
</p>
<p>two girls with only a casual glance. Not so the elder
</p>
<p>one, who already claimed the homage of an earnest,
</p>
<p>oft-repeated gaze from every passer-by, not infre-
</p>
<p>quently accompanied with exclamations of admiration
</p>
<p>and surprise, with an enthusiasm, too, which sent the
</p>
<p>rich, warm blood to her cheeks, though why she could
</p>
<p>not tell.
</p>
<p>The two children, named respectively Pearl and
</p>
<p>Fra La Grange, whose ages ranged from five to eight,
</p>
<p>were little run-a-ways.
</p>
<p>Venturing nearer the water's edge, the children
</p>
<p>hovered upon the verge of the wharf, charmed with
</p>
<p>the grotesque figures they cut on the surface of its
</p>
<p>mirror-view below. At length they stretched them-
</p>
<p>selves upon the rude planks, leaning dangerously over
</p>
<p>the edge and swinging their sun-hats, while they prat-
</p>
<p>tled to the measures of the circles thus made.

</p>
<p>ning to ache in keeping up with the gyrations of her

</p>
<p>sister's practiced hand, indeed already dizzy with its
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 5
</p>
<p>routine whirl, and puzzled to distinguish the real
</p>
<p>o'erhead from the reflected sky which lay world-deep
</p>
<p>below their shadow pictures, dropping her little tired
</p>
<p>head heavily, was, by her chubby weight, suddenly
</p>
<p>capsized headlong into the clear depths below.
</p>
<p>Pearl, who until this moment was absorbed in the
</p>
<p>swift revolutions of her mimic pin-wheel, hearing a
</p>
<p>loud plash, and seeming the little form of Fra strug-
</p>
<p>gling in the water, quickly commanded herself, and
</p>
<p>seizing her baby sister by the hair, dragged her out
</p>
<p>with a force which sent both of them rolling over
</p>
<p>together upon the wharf.
</p>
<p>The strange incident was enacted so quickly that
</p>
<p>neither of the children realized the peril which both
</p>
<p>had miraculously escaped.
</p>
<p>To Pearl the river had proved itself the great water
</p>
<p>giant her mother had so often warned her against,
</p>
<p>and which, to punish her for her disobedience, had
</p>
<p>opened its jaws and tried to swallow little Fra. The
</p>
<p>fact of having successfully snatched her back inspired
</p>
<p>Pearl to give the giant a defiant glance, and seizing
</p>
<p>Fra by the hand she bade her look and see the great
</p>
<p>hole they had left; but to her astonishment the river
</p>
<p>ran on as smoothly and unbrokenly as ever, and only
</p>
<p>the sad face of little Fra and her sopping wet garments
</p>
<p>remained to tell the tale.

</p>
<p>To Fra the sensation of being rescued was quite as
</p>
<p>6 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>shocking as the unpremeditated plunge, and both of
</p>
<p>the children grew thoughtful and reticent.
</p>
<p>With Pearl, whose soul already trembled and vi-
</p>
<p>brated, tossed upon the rough winds of adversity,
</p>
<p>there were many grave questions to settle at the bar
</p>
<p>of her tender conscience. Love and fear were battling
</p>
<p>in her heart, the love of mother drawing, and the
</p>
<p>fear of father repelling, her steps homeward. She
</p>
<p>had left an invalid mother's presence joyous, antici-
</p>
<p>pating a quick return with a full basket for her hand-
</p>
<p>ful of pence; but, intercepted by their father, who,
</p>
<p>with oaths and threats, extorted the money which was
</p>
<p>to be exchanged for a birth-day treat, the frightened
</p>
<p>children left the basket upon the market steps, and
</p>
<p>ran till their feet were descending the graded thor-
</p>
<p>oughfare leading to the boat-houses. Here, attracted
</p>
<p>by sails and skiffs, playing like dolphins upon the
</p>
<p>river's surface, they had loitered hours, oblivious to
</p>
<p>everything but the entrancing scene before them.
</p>
<p>The adventure recalled Pearl to her senses, arid a
</p>
<p>sharp pain shot through her heart as she remembered
</p>
<p>how very much weaker her mother had seemed that
</p>
<p>morning, and the eager, wan look in her tender eyes,
</p>
<p>as she pleaded for their quick return.
</p>
<p>In all the world there was nothing to Pearl so
</p>
<p>lovely as her mother's face. Her eyes had sought and

</p>
<p>drank in the beautiful in everything, and her imagi-
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 7
</p>
<p>nation was ever busy surrounding this being of her
</p>
<p>heart's worship, with all the gathered treasures of her
</p>
<p>fancy. Now conscience was lashing her into a tem-
</p>
<p>pest of regrets. She saw herself in the light of truant
</p>
<p>and betrayer of a fond mother's confidence; and not
</p>
<p>the least of her miseries, was the sight of Era's ruined
</p>
<p>frock, as much her province to protect, and second
</p>
<p>(in consideration of their poverty) in importance to
</p>
<p>the life she had so bravely saved. For be it under-
</p>
<p>stood, though a child in years, Pearl was a remarka-
</p>
<p>bly cogent reasoner. Close association and compan-
</p>
<p>ionship with a refined and intellectual mother, would
</p>
<p>have advanced a less tractable mind beyond the ordi-
</p>
<p>nary standard; but her ready genius, and marvellous
</p>
<p>intuition, placed her beyond her years, making her a
</p>
<p>child in no sense, save in her freshness of heart, buoy-
</p>
<p>ancy of spirits, and love for play, which her superb
</p>
<p>physical vigor demanded.
</p>
<p>Fra, accustomed to the still, rapt moods of her sis-
</p>
<p>ter, kept silence in concert, merely pulling apart
</p>
<p>Pearl's clasped hands, and gently insinuating between
</p>
<p>them her own little palm to reassure her.
</p>
<p>How long the young dreamer might have continued
</p>
<p>planning for the redemption of this misspent day is
</p>
<p>impossible to say, had not the full rays of the sun

</p>
<p>looked straight into her face, and an impression of
</p>
<p>8 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>the dying day, and the long climb up the steep bluff,
</p>
<p>prompted her to return home at once.
</p>
<p>Springing to her feet, she caught Fra in her bare
</p>
<p>and beautifully rounded arms, making as light of her
</p>
<p>burden in plump flesh, as though it consisted of wax
</p>
<p>and sawdust. The bluff was precipitous, but Era's
</p>
<p>feet did not touch the earth till the entire ascent was
</p>
<p>made.
</p>
<p>"Now," said Pearl, "we must walk quickly, and you
</p>
<p>must not go into the house, till I have told mamma
</p>
<p>all about your being drowned and your spoiled birth-
</p>
<p>day dress."
</p>
<p>Before them in all directions within the scope of
</p>
<p>vision, stretched the architectural reaches of a mighty
</p>
<p>city the proud namesake of a renowned apostle.
</p>
<p>High-browed summits stood out like emerald brack-
</p>
<p>ets, supporting their marble palaces; castles, embow-
</p>
<p>ered in ivy, rose like huge marble vases dripping with
</p>
<p>blossoms from beds of flowers. The river, in serpen-
</p>
<p>tine curves, wound like a crystal necklace these cas-
</p>
<p>tellated heights, and Gothic and Swiss cottages peeped
</p>
<p>from the deep umbrage of mottled green.
</p>
<p>Beside such pictured loveliness, such heaped and
</p>
<p>concentrated wealth, and in the same cherubic ele-
</p>
<p>ment, God's air, huddled the lowly tenements of the
</p>
<p>forlorn and despised poor.

</p>
<p>Pearl halted and gazed upon the entrancing picture
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 9
</p>
<p>before descending into the depths of the more popu-
</p>
<p>lous but less pretentious neighborhoods of the city.
</p>
<p>Suddenly recalling her trip to the forbidden river,
</p>
<p>and shivering as she remembered her father's aager,
</p>
<p>she urged the nagging footsteps of little Fra, and the
</p>
<p>two children pursued their way in silence.
</p>
<p>Let us anticipate their arrival by entering the
</p>
<p>home, yet hallowed by a mother's love. The build-
</p>
<p>ing, which hung over an alley, had a tumble-down
</p>
<p>expression. It had two apartments, in the most com-
</p>
<p>modious of which, upon her dying bed, lay the fond
</p>
<p>mother of Pearl and Fra. The ceiling was low, but
</p>
<p>the walls shone white and clean, and an air of refine-
</p>
<p>ment pervaded the place.
</p>
<p>This effort to hide the horrid skeleton presiding
</p>
<p>over the drunkard's home had sorely taxed the in-
</p>
<p>genious brain and deft fingers of the devoted mother.
</p>
<p>At last her gentle heart was breaking, and the shadow
</p>
<p>whicji hung over Kobert LaGrange's home on this
</p>
<p>night was the visible shade of death.
</p>
<p>With her expiring strength the mother had occu-
</p>
<p>pied the morning in assisting her children to don
</p>
<p>their holiday attire, entrusting to Pearl money
</p>
<p>and errands for the embellishment of the day, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to their innocent desires.
</p>
<p>Since the expiration of the hour allotted them her

</p>
<p>eyes had wandered vainly toward the open casement.
</p>
<p>10 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>The little table which Pearl had drawn up to the bed-
</p>
<p>side, spread with its grateful morsels, had been her
</p>
<p>only nurse and companion through the long, weary
</p>
<p>day.
</p>
<p>At last she heard footsteps, but they were slow and
</p>
<p>uncertain, and, recoiling with a sigh of disappoint-
</p>
<p>ment, she saw the reeling figure of La Grange enter
</p>
<p>the room. And who, once familiar with the erect
</p>
<p>form, elastic step, frank and handsome face of Robert
</p>
<p>La Grange, would have recognized in the bloated fea-
</p>
<p>tures, downcast eyes and shambling tread the wreck
</p>
<p>of such youthful promise! But some of the brightest
</p>
<p>morning-stars of manhood that have risen upon the
</p>
<p>world have been lured by the social glass down to the
</p>
<p>abysmal hells of the Rum Shop. None ever dragged
</p>
<p>with them a purer life or gentler heart than the one
</p>
<p>now beating out its last faithful pulsations on that
</p>
<p>altar where is written the mutual pledge, "till death."
</p>
<p>" Where is Pearl? " growled the wretched bloat.
</p>
<p>"I know not," said the dying woman.
</p>
<p>" Perhaps she is looking for the money I took from
</p>
<p>her at the market steps," confessed the chattering
</p>
<p>drunkard. But his words making no visible impres-
</p>
<p>sion, he settled into an arm-chair and instantly drop-
</p>
<p>ped off into the dead stupor which locks the senses of
</p>
<p>the liquor-pickled inebriate.

</p>
<p>Again the life-forces rallied, and the yearning eyes
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 11
</p>
<p>were at last rewarded by seeing Pearl enter. At the
</p>
<p>sight of her wretched father the child shrank, but
</p>
<p>seeing that he observed nothing, she stealthily ap-
</p>
<p>proached her mother's bedside. Pearl had never
</p>
<p>been in the presence of death, yet the awful pallor,
</p>
<p>the pinched expression, the glazing eye all told her
</p>
<p>that something terrible was impending.
</p>
<p>Maternal love and fear spoke through the tender
</p>
<p>eyes.
</p>
<p>"Where is your little sister?" faintly whispered
</p>
<p>the dying woman.
</p>
<p>''Drownded!" said Pearl, not perceiving the mis-
</p>
<p>chief in the word, and referring to the wilted garment.
</p>
<p>"Drowned! " gasped the trembling lips, upon which
</p>
<p>the breath of life yet fluttered. Pearl hastened to
</p>
<p>explain her cruel words.
</p>
<p>"No, mama, dear; Fra is not dead. I caught her
</p>
<p>by her hair and dragged her out alone. And she is
</p>
<p>here, close here, sweet mama! Oh, mama, speak to
</p>
<p>Pearl!" But the staring eyes retained their fixed
</p>
<p>expression.
</p>
<p>Pearl ran, and seizing the astonished little Fra, who
</p>
<p>sat patiently outside awaiting her forgiveness, bore
</p>
<p>her swiftly into the presence of what? Her mother?
</p>
<p>No! for the cold angel had set his seal. But
</p>
<p>the children comprehended it not, and Pearl, holding

</p>
<p>Fra up before the rigid face, cried piteously.
</p>
<p>12 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>" Here is little Fra, mama. She only spoiled her
</p>
<p>frock. I thought you would forgive all when I told
</p>
<p>you how God helped me drag her out O, rnama!
</p>
<p>Do not look so strange! Tell me you forgive! " And
</p>
<p>Pearl kissed the icy lips again and again, and buried
</p>
<p>her face in the long, disheveled hair that lay in coils
</p>
<p>upon the snowy pillow.
</p>
<p>Lifting her mother's hand, she strove in the old
</p>
<p>way to get within the encircling arms; but the hand
</p>
<p>fell back stark and pallid,
</p>
<p>" Father! " shrieked Pearl.
</p>
<p>The drunkard lifted his head, opened his bloodshot
</p>
<p>eyes, and taking in the group upon the bed, slowly
</p>
<p>comprehended that something had happened. He
</p>
<p>essayed to rise, but fell back. At length, sobered by
</p>
<p>an awful apprehension, he staggered to the bed, thrust
</p>
<p>the children aside, placed his ear over the heart of his
</p>
<p>wife, and turned ashy pale.
</p>
<p>"Annie! Good Wife!" he cried. But the lips
</p>
<p>which had gladly responded to such words a few
</p>
<p>hours before, moved not.
</p>
<p>Pearl watched him, impressed as profoundly by her
</p>
<p>father's manifestation of feeling as by her mother's

<p>apparent indifference; and, venturing nearer, she

<p>tremblingly asked:

</p>
<p>affrighted, gazing imploringly into her father's face.
</p>
<p>"O, tell me, father, may I go? and will dear mama

<p>speak again? "
</p>
<p>Holding his wife's hand, La Grange again placed
</p>
<p>his ear over her heart.
</p>
<p>"Dead ! " said he; and the conscience-smitten hus-

<p>wife.
</p>
<p>Pearl caught the awful word "dead," and, with a

<p>shriek which might have recalled the departing spirit

<p>and pierced the ear of God, the child fell upon the
</p>
<p>bosom of her lifeless mother and swooned away.

<p>CHAPTEE II.
</p>
<p>Among the heath-clad hills
</p>
<p>Of Scotia's verdant plains,
</p>
<p>A letter comes, whose presence thrills
</p>
<p>Where deathless love remains.
</p>
<p>The world has its strong prejudices. One of these
</p>
<p>will probably cling to it as long as it makes its revolu-
</p>
<p>tions, and teems with the life of its thinking millions.
</p>
<p>To be well-born is the prerequisite to individual
</p>
<p>stamina of character, and the full confidence of the
</p>
<p>world. To be well, or meanly born, does not imply to
</p>
<p>be richly or poorly ushered into life. Neither does it

</p>
<p>14 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>universe; but, having a far deeper signification, it
</p>
<p>may be compared to the good seed planted in the
</p>
<p>fallow earth, which rarely betrays its promise of an
</p>
<p>abundant harvest.
</p>
<p>There are, however, well-born people, like professed
</p>
<p>followers of Christ, who are the Peters of their disci-
</p>
<p>pleship, fallible and prone to lapses from virtue, as
</p>
<p>the sparks to fly upward. Yet even here does the in-
</p>
<p>tegrity of their birth assert its supremacy and, like
</p>
<p>the anchor to the vessel, while permitting a variety of
</p>
<p>deviations to the lead of enticing winds, tugs ever at
</p>
<p>its heart strings, and forever holds it back from enter-
</p>
<p>ing upon the highways of total destruction.
</p>
<p>Bobert La Grange was well born, in the true sense
</p>
<p>of integral creation. He was of French extraction,
</p>
<p>and the ascent of his family tree upon both sides,
</p>
<p>could be made from base to apex, without stepping
</p>
<p>upon a rotten branch.
</p>
<p>His grandfather, was a native of Gascony, France,
</p>
<p>and claimed direct lineal issue from the house of La
</p>
<p>Grange the nobleman, whose too faithful genealogical
</p>
<p>record cost him his head during the French Revol-
</p>
<p>ution.
</p>
<p>His family, thereupon impressed with the wisdom
</p>
<p>of the axiom, commending discretion as the better
</p>
<p>part of valor, fled before the shadows of the guillotine,

<p>and Anthony La Grange, third in lineal descent,
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 15
</p>
<p>settled in the beautiful vale of Monteith, among the
</p>
<p>hills of Campsie, surrounded by the most romantic
</p>
<p>and picturesque scenery in the highlands of Scotland.
</p>
<p>In this favored spot, hemmed in by grand and
</p>
<p>rugged hills, and skirted with the softer and richer
</p>
<p>elements of rural vegetation, Kobert LaGrange first
</p>
<p>saw the light. His wife, Annie Boyd, was the third
</p>
<p>daughter of an eminent Scotch clergyman, whose
</p>
<p>devout humble-mindedness, never seemed to gather a
</p>
<p>tarnish of vanity through its claims of having been
</p>
<p>veined from the royal blood of the patriots and
</p>
<p>martyrs, the brave-hearted covenanters of Scotland.
</p>
<p>It was ever the good man's delight to rehearse those
</p>
<p>thrilling scenes in Scottish history, which transpired
</p>
<p>in the dark days of persecution under Charles the
</p>
<p>first, and his faded gray eyes would rekindle their
</p>
<p>youthful fires when relating stirring incidents handed
</p>
<p>down through a long line of noble ancestry.
</p>
<p>Indeed, history has poorly haloed the heads of
</p>
<p>those illustrious souls who kept alive in Britain the
</p>
<p>light of gospel truth, when that light was well-nigh
</p>
<p>extinguished, stemming the torrents of temporal and
</p>
<p>spiritual tyranny.
</p>
<p>"From scenes like these auld Scotia's grandeur springs,
</p>
<p>That makes her loved at home, revered abroad.
</p>
<p>Princes and Lords are but the breath of Kings;
</p>
<p>An honest man's the noblest work of God."

<p>In sight of Sterling, a fine old Scottish town near
</p>
<p>16 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>the river Forth at the base of the Ochil Hills, stands
</p>
<p>a little thatch-roofed house, known throughout that
</p>
<p>rich and cultivated plain as "The Boyd Cottage."
</p>
<p>Before entering, let us ascend the ledge of rocks,
</p>
<p>which present in their ragged edges, a circuitous
</p>
<p>staircase, leading to the cloud-capped summits over-
</p>
<p>head. The view from these heights is sublime, and,
</p>
<p>if in time to witness a sunrise, you have spread out
</p>
<p>before you one of the rarest pictures in a world of
</p>
<p>universal loveliness. The sun, from these altitudes,
</p>
<p>seems as though rising out of a deep, emerald sea,
</p>
<p>and his ardent glances, as they pierce the dewdrops
</p>
<p>upon the heather bells, set them twinkling like a
</p>
<p>thousand stars at your feet. You hear around you
</p>
<p>the scream of the eagle, the bleating of the lamb, the
</p>
<p>merry song of the shepherd and his shrill whistle as
</p>
<p>he calls to his faithful collie, the companion and
</p>
<p>assistant in the watch of the fold.
</p>
<p>Amid such scenes, it is no marvel that strong, manly
</p>
<p>attributes, and sweet womanly refinements, character-
</p>
<p>ized the youth who took root, budded and bloomed
</p>
<p>on its soil.
</p>
<p>Sixteen years had passed since Annie Boyd, young-
</p>
<p>est child and the pride of the old cottager, becoming
</p>
<p>the \jife of Robert La Grange, had bidden adieu to
</p>
<p>her native vale. Not long do the old birds hover

<p>around the empty nest, unless a wounded fledgling

</p>
<p>returns, to nestle again in its brooding warmth; for a
</p>
<p>childless home is but a sepulchre for memory's ghost
</p>
<p>to haunt with taunting visions of the past an empty
</p>
<p>vase, a goblet drained, and broken! Eemember this,
</p>
<p>O fond and happy mother, while trundle-bed and crib
</p>
<p>are full, and dimpled arms encircle your neck, and
</p>
<p>busy fingers toy watonly with the order of your rooms,
</p>
<p>pull at your skirts, and throw in sweet confusion all
</p>
<p>your careful elegances; while yet the velvet lips and
</p>
<p>rose-leaf breath of infancy, with downy head, is pil-
</p>
<p>lowed on your heart; remember, these are life's ripe
</p>
<p>and golden hours, which are winged with the spirited
</p>
<p>flight and brilliancy of a meteor's march through
</p>
<p>heaven. Even now, the cooler months are trailing
</p>
<p>with pale blossoms at the dainty skirts of your sum-
</p>
<p>mer robes, and gliding stealthily apace; December
</p>
<p>looms with icy breath, and hoary locks, weaving his
</p>
<p>frost-spangled garments, airy and filmy as the veil of
</p>
<p>a bride, and why not ? She is bringing in heaped
</p>
<p>hands, the wedding garments of death! Night is
</p>
<p>shutting down over the rocky cliffs, and the old Boyd
</p>
<p>cottage seems less a dwelling than some torn, weather-
</p>
<p>beaten, and deserted bird's nest, hanging upon its
</p>
<p>ragged sides, sad-faced and gloomy, in the sombre
</p>
<p>shadows of a moonless eve.

<p>One lonely occupant remains, the widowed sister

</p>
<p>drawn a little table near to the dull-burning peat
</p>
<p>fire, and, seating herself, proceeds to open a letter
</p>
<p>(in size, a package), whose sudden arrival at the
</p>
<p>hands of her kind neighbor seems more the presence
</p>
<p>of an angel visitant, than written words, weeks old;
</p>
<p>but the stamp is a foreign one, and the emotional ex-
</p>
<p>citement within is telegraphed through the nerves,
</p>
<p>and outspoken in the trembling fingers, as they hasten
</p>
<p>to break the seal.
</p>
<p>The handwriting was not familiar, since the news
</p>
<p>of Annie's death, the sister had heard nothing of the
</p>
<p>family remaining to Robert La Grange. Her heart
</p>
<p>beat audibly, as she unfolded the package of closely
</p>
<p>written pages.
</p>
<p>The letter was from Robert La Grange, and it read
</p>
<p>as follows:
</p>
<p>ST. SAUL, Mar. 1st, 18 .
</p>
<p>My Dear Sister!
</p>
<p>After years of silence, this letter
</p>
<p>will greet you in the character of a surprise. I have
</p>
<p>been determined upon writing it for some time. My
</p>
<p>failing health admonishes me I am likely to be
</p>
<p>ushered into the presence of God at any hour. I
</p>
<p>have much to say to you before this supreme moment
</p>
<p>is upon me, and much, very much more to ask of you,
</p>
<p>after enlisting your patient indulgence with me, in the
</p>
<p>reading of this letter to the end.

<p>died of a broken heart. This is the figure, the literal
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 19
</p>
<p>of which is I murdered her ! It was death by
</p>
<p>slow torture, as much so as if I had bound her to the
</p>
<p>stake and applied the burning fagots, keeping up the
</p>
<p>fires day and night.
</p>
<p>In the Gallery of Art in Milan is an immense
</p>
<p>painting, a representation of one of the modes of In-
</p>
<p>quisitorial punishment. The figures are bound to
</p>
<p>wooden crosses, and under the nail of every finger
</p>
<p>and toe, sharp lancet quilla are deeply driven, through
</p>
<p>which the life-blood continually trickles away, until
</p>
<p>the heart breaks in its effort to draw back the receding
</p>
<p>flood.
</p>
<p>For months after Annie died, this picture was pre-
</p>
<p>sented to my vision, awake or asleep. It is an illus-
</p>
<p>tration of the cruelties of which I have been guilty,
</p>
<p>but which the law took no cognizance of; hence I was
</p>
<p>left to the scourging lash of that stern monitor of the
</p>
<p>soul, CONSCIENCE ! which, after a lethargic sleep of
</p>
<p>ten years, "awoke to vivid life at the death-bed of
</p>
<p>Annie, and only since my partial expiation, has it
</p>
<p>given me the respite of a tranquil heart.
</p>
<p>The steps which carried me down were few, but
</p>
<p>precipitous. You gleaned from Annie intelligence of
</p>
<p>the rough voyage we had in crossing over to America.
</p>
<p>Much was kept back of this voyage, which ended in a
</p>
<p>shipwreck, and the loss of all we had, save my money,
</p>
<p>which I belted around me before going on board ship.

<p>Annie must have suffered bitterly the loss of all cloth-

<p>ing and bedding, but I never heard her murmur, and

<p>her love for the old folks spared them the unhappy

</p>
<p>20 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>This secretiveness at the outset from motives most
</p>
<p>tender and pure established the precedent, after-
</p>
<p>wards deemed justifiable and expedient, of withhold-
</p>
<p>ing through a decade of years, all further recital of
</p>
<p>our domestic miseries.
</p>
<p>It was, however, reserved for my punishment to re-
</p>
<p>view this army of spectres my misdeeds each one
</p>
<p>rising up separately in judgment against me, in the
</p>
<p>handwriting of my victim.
</p>
<p>In this recital I am profoundly impressed with the
</p>
<p>inscrutable ways of God's providence. Through his
</p>
<p>mercy we were saved from the wreck of the sinking
</p>
<p>Europa. The men secured and loaded our boats with
</p>
<p>many casks of choice liquors, which our exposure
</p>
<p>demanded we should use freely. It was then that the
</p>
<p>accursed taste* for the demon drink took first and full
</p>
<p>possession of me, and its hold was as unrelaxing as
</p>
<p>its rule was demoniac. I felt as powerless as one
</p>
<p>might in being carried over Niagara, and my way
</p>
<p>out looked as impossible.
</p>
<p>I loved my wife and our children, and had lucid
</p>
<p>intervals of regret, and seasons of attempted reform-
</p>
<p>ation; but no sooner did I come near a dram shop,
</p>
<p>and catch its fumes, than I was set upon by the
</p>
<p>persuasive muscular powers of a thousand devils, who
</p>
<p>seized upon me, and dragged me again into the pres-
</p>
<p>ence of the wretch who clutched for my money as
</p>
<p>eagerly as Satan and his accomplices did for my soul,
</p>
<p>when the hellish draught was first presented me in
</p>
<p>the disguise of a stimulant.
</p>
<p>I descended rapidly, until I was thoroughly besot-

</p>
<p>ted, blind, and incorrigible; my whole nature was
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 21
</p>
<p>warped, my soul smothered in a sea of liquid fire! The
</p>
<p>home, purchased on locating in St. Saul, I mortgaged
</p>
<p>to assuage the thirst of the despot raging within, and
</p>
<p>goading me on to destruction; and the mortgagee
</p>
<p>could only collect rent of me, by watching his chances
</p>
<p>to follow me into saloons, and seizing the money on
</p>
<p>its way to the counter. This he did, with the double
</p>
<p>purpose of saving Annie the annoyance of a dun, and
</p>
<p>the sufferance of my inebriated presence, for that
</p>
<p>night at least.
</p>
<p>It would have been a mystery to me to the end of
</p>
<p>time how Annie supported herself and the children
</p>
<p>during these years, had she not bequeathed me from
</p>
<p>under her dying pillow, the record of their sufferings
</p>
<p>and support.
</p>
<p>You know Annie was a good musician. Her old
</p>
<p>Scotch guitar was strapped over my shoulders, and
</p>
<p>saved with our lives, from the ship's wreck; "for who
</p>
<p>knows," said the then light-hearted Annie, "but I may
</p>
<p>have to earn our bread with this when we get to
</p>
<p>America."
</p>
<p>How more than verified were her words, spoken
</p>
<p>cheerily under the shadow of the sinking Europa!
</p>
<p>This guitar is still in my possession, and, after my
</p>
<p>beloved Pearl is the dearest and saddest relic left me.
</p>
<p>But I must hasten to the sequel of my strange fall
</p>
<p>from the proud heights of manhood, and my regained
</p>
<p>position, morally, as you must realize I am a ruined
</p>
<p>man financially; not because I am too old to acquire
</p>
<p>wealth, but because I am far gone in consumption, and

<p>restoration to health is impossible.
</p>
<p>22 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>To Pearl, the angel of my home, I owe all that I
</p>
<p>am; the hope of reconciliation to Annie in heaven,
</p>
<p>and the forgiveness of Jehovah! Pearl was never a
</p>
<p>child. She seemed to become a woman at the death
</p>
<p>bed of Annie. Her appeal to me, in the presence of
</p>
<p>her dead mother, sobered every faculty of my soul. I
</p>
<p>shuddered before her innocence and wisdom. It was
</p>
<p>like the breaking up of the fountains of the great
</p>
<p>deep, and Satan fell from under. I sprang to my
</p>
<p>feet as a captive from whom the fetters are suddenly
</p>
<p>broken, a man once more, and the father and pro-
</p>
<p>tector of the daughter who knelt at my feet, with the
</p>
<p>eyes of Annie imploring me.
</p>
<p>A dark shadow hung over our home, but it fell to
</p>
<p>lift a greater shadow, and in Heaven there was double
</p>
<p>cause for rejoicing, over the released prisoner from
</p>
<p>sorrow, and the reclaimed prisoner from sin.
</p>
<p>I have been able to keep Pearl in the Mozart
</p>
<p>School of Art, and to supply the money for oar modest
</p>
<p>wants. The circle of our acquaintance is not large,
</p>
<p>but select for the poor may choose their friends
</p>
<p>and Pearl is only seen, to be admired and loved. She
</p>
<p>will soon complete her studies, and has already an op-
</p>
<p>portunity to take pupils in music. This reassures me
</p>
<p>regarding her financial independence when I am gone.
</p>
<p>But this is not enough for a girl whose extreme youth
</p>
<p>and beauty, exposes her to the unsparing comment of
</p>
<p>a censorious community. She must have a guardian.
</p>
<p>Now, my sister, have you not already divined the
</p>
<p>secret wishes of my heart, and the mission of thi/s

</p>
<p>Why should the ocean divide us ? I cannot die and
</p>
<p>leave this child's pure presence unprotected. The
</p>
<p>shield of some great, strong and deathless love must
</p>
<p>guard her youth, and ward from her the faintest shade
</p>
<p>of harm with which the world is all familiar. Her
</p>
<p>loveliness would be delightful to me could I live to
</p>
<p>shield it. It saddens now, and makes me wish she
</p>
<p>were not half so beautiful. You have been a prudent
</p>
<p>girl, and a mother, and know how sensitive to soil is
</p>
<p>virtue. Surely, if living still, you will not let Pearl
</p>
<p>be alone, when I lie down to die. So come, and make
</p>
<p>me glad before the heart-strings break. The voices
</p>
<p>of our dead, as mine in dying, call upon you. I have

<p>reserved a sum sufficient for your journey, if you

<p>In all these years memory had kept faithful watch ,

<p>erious graves." No one but the old Sexton had ever
</p>
<p>seen their faithful visitor and adorn er; and he was
</p>
<p>incessantly plied with questions concerning them. The
</p>
<p>answers to these so excited the youthful romancers of
</p>
<p>the town, that many strangers could be seen in the
</p>
<p>long summer evenings, sauntering over the yard in
</p>
<p>search of the "unknown graves, and the young girl in
</p>
<p>white."
</p>
<p>Profoundly impressed with the notoriety and im-
</p>
<p>portance this unshared secret gave him, about which
</p>
<p>the world seemed daily more curious to unravel, Pat,
</p>
<p>who was not a little superstitious, would roll his
</p>
<p>Hibernian blue eyes upward, cross himself before
</p>
<p>his questioners, and " 'By the Holy Saint Pathrick',
</p>
<p>declare her to be 'An Angel,' and no ither, who
</p>
<p>tended those graves."
</p>
<p>Only on Sabbath evening could she be seen. "Niver
</p>
<p>one word does she spake to me" said he, "but with
</p>
<p>the Virgin Mary's smile she goes by me, her white
</p>
<p>gown fluttering like an angel's wing intirely; and
</p>
<p>faith", said he, "I. fall, as Saul did before the blissed
</p>
<p>light, and I never roise, till I've counted my ivery

</p>
<p>mended it, with all kindred cities, to the care of the
</p>
<p>angels, who keep a sacred watch, and very night
</p>
<p>delight to brim their urns with holy light!
</p>
<p>The city of busy life swarms near, where the erec-
</p>
<p>tion of twenty miles of building annually, is seemingly
</p>
<p>but a mere pastime for the ambitious artisan.
</p>
<p>Bordering the picturesque grounds of "Tangle-
</p>
<p>wood," and raying out like so many sunbeams escap-
</p>
<p>ing from a dense forestry of shade, forked the broad
</p>
<p>carriage drives of Rural heights. It was the closing
</p>
<p>of a midsummer's day, and the earth lay under a
</p>
<p>canopy of iridescent clouds. That it was the world's
</p>
<p>leisure hour, no proclamation w'as required to estab-
</p>
<p>lish, but the positive edict of vision.
</p>
<p>The motley crowds were out in full force; eren the
</p>
<p>wide avenues were blocked with vehicles of every des-
</p>
<p>cription, from the shining equipages and equestrian
</p>
<p>trappings of the monied aristocracy whose ruling
</p>
<p>dictum is a golden sceptre down to the modest
</p>
<p>chaise, and donkey cart, and the rude, unpretentious
</p>
<p>rigs of the countrymen. Pedestrians were sprinkled
</p>
<p>thickly through, who cautiously picked their way
</p>
<p>among prancing steeds, enveloped in blinding clouds
</p>
<p>of dust.
</p>
<p>Conspicuous among the grand turn-outs, was a

<p>nor Kellogg, a man whose royal, intellectual gifts
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 27
</p>
<p>adorned the gubernatorial chair, as confessedly as
</p>
<p>his universal popularity, socially, made him the cyno-
</p>
<p>sure of every eye, when exposed to public gaze.
</p>
<p>Beside this brain-king among men, sat his wife,
</p>
<p>whose countenance, from only a passing, casual glance,
</p>
<p>might have impressed one ( poorly visioned ) as come-
</p>
<p>ly, but upon close study and careful scrutiny revealed
</p>
<p>an ugly collection of facial corrugations, that told but
</p>
<p>too plainly the fierce warfare of contending passions
</p>
<p>within.
</p>
<p>Her build was coarse and angular, and her nature
</p>
<p>selfish and irritable in the extreme; yet her social
</p>
<p>diplomacy was such, that she concealed this moral
</p>
<p>warp of hers from the world, and when she left her
</p>
<p>boudoir, as completely laid aside her real, reptilian
</p>
<p>self with her domestic habiliments, as though she had
</p>
<p>exchanged souls with some delightful being, and re-
</p>
<p>veled in the recreative effect, as pleasing to herself
</p>
<p>as to her noble consort.
</p>
<p>Now, I do not believe the world contains many such
</p>
<p>two-fold existences; but a "fallen angel," now and
</p>
<p>then at the fireside, is sufficient proof to the most
</p>
<p>skeptical, that none but a Christ could redeem and
</p>
<p>restore such Eves to the despoiled realms of their
</p>
<p>lost Edens.
</p>
<p>With her consummate tact, masked in smiles, and

<p>her suavities, haloed in the beauty-embellishments of

</p>
<p>satin, lace and diamonds, and under the escort of a
</p>
<p>princely man, it is not marvelous that she shared,
</p>
<p>scarcely second to her husband, the admiration and
</p>
<p>esteem of all.
</p>
<p>At the junction of the avenues, the carriages entered
</p>
<p>Circle Park, bright with blooming shrubbery, frolic-
</p>
<p>some fountains, royal foliage beds, and spirited music.
</p>
<p>Here a strife among the coachmen resulted in a seri-
</p>
<p>ous blockade of rolling vehicles, putting them at their
</p>
<p>wit's end to steer clear of each other. Coaches col-
</p>
<p>lided, wheels locked, drivers screamed out terrible
</p>
<p>oaths, and ladies fainted.
</p>
<p>Suddenly, above the confusion and din, came the
</p>
<p>shrill cry, "Halt ! You are running over women and
</p>
<p>children!"
</p>
<p>All but the Governor's team obeyed. The excited
</p>
<p>animals, plunging and rearing, dashed forward with
</p>
<p>mad precipitancy which threatened to sweep every-
</p>
<p>thing in their path.
</p>
<p>The Governor's hands were now holding the reins,
</p>
<p>but to no effect. The mettle of his thoroughbreds was
</p>
<p>up, and nothing short of a very miracle could save the
</p>
<p>precious lives they dragged after them.
</p>
<p>Rapidly clearing the circle of the Park, they
</p>
<p>plunged into the crowded thoroughfare leading city-
</p>
<p>ward.

</p>
<p>With incredible swiftness the avenue was cleared
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 29
</p>
<p>in advance of them as on they flew with dauntless
</p>
<p>speed. The danger attending an attempted rescue of
</p>
<p>the beloved Governor and his lady seemed as great as
</p>
<p>to await the ominous results of the accident; and he-
</p>
<p>roes and heroines are not made of common stuff, so
</p>
<p>the gaping crowd looked on.
</p>
<p>At this juncture, a poor little hunchback, trying to
</p>
<p>effect an impossible escape in crossing, hesitated,
</p>
<p>as if undecided which way to move, or paralyzed
</p>
<p>with fear. To the consternation of every beholder, a
</p>
<p>young girl, with a face as white as her spotless gar-
</p>
<p>ments, threw herself in front of the horses and seiz-
</p>
<p>ing the trembling hunchback, had nearly dragged
</p>
<p>him out of the path, arresting the attention of the af-
</p>
<p>frighted horses which now wheeled, striking the curb-
</p>
<p>stone and upsetting the cabriolet and its occupants.
</p>
<p>In the blinding clouds of dust which enveloped
</p>
<p>everything around them, it was impossible to
</p>
<p>comprehend the extent of the catastrophe. The horses
</p>
<p>were captured, and like wildfire the news was spread
</p>
<p>over the city that Governor Kellogg and his lady had
</p>
<p>been picked up senseless.
</p>
<p>The carriage of his private secretary, which had
</p>
<p>kept as closely in the wake of the runaway as possible,
</p>
<p>had borne the insensible forms of the Governor and

</p>
<p>and particular friends had followed; and that was as
</p>
<p>much as the world could glean.
</p>
<p>The excitement was beyond description. Curiosity
</p>
<p>ran at fever heat concerning the name and rank of
</p>
<p>the intrepid girl who had fearlessly thrown herself
</p>
<p>in the path of the flying steeds, had checked their
</p>
<p>course, saved the lives of the august pair, and had
</p>
<p>attempted also to save the life of an unfortunate
</p>
<p>hunchback who, trampled under the horses' hoofs,
</p>
<p>was supposed to have been killed outright.
</p>
<p>Some one who claimed to have known the girl
</p>
<p>when the pupil of the Maestro conducting the Mozart
</p>
<p>School of Art, said "she was a young music-teacher,
</p>
<p>enthused with her art, very poor and saintly beauti-
</p>
<p>ful;" and "certainly," added her earnest advocate, "has
</p>
<p>proved herself an American heroine with a Greek
</p>
<p>soul!"
</p>
<p>The secretary's carriage had hardly rolled away
</p>
<p>with its sad burden in the direction of the Governor's
</p>
<p>mansion, when a genial-faced gentleman with an anxi-
</p>
<p>ous expression of countenance, nervously questioning
</p>
<p>every passer-by, hurriedly walked in the direction of
</p>
<p>the Park. The man was in the meridian of life, very
</p>
<p>erect, of slight but symmetrical build and dressed in
</p>
<p>a professional suit of black broadcloth.

<p>lowing notice, which enlivened all the lamp-posts and
</p>
<p>was placarded along the thoroughfares leading in and
</p>
<p>out of the city in all directions :
</p>
<p>A MEDICAL INSTITUTE.
</p>
<p>"A meeting of the Medical Institute of the great

</p>
<p>of the most distinguished M. D.s' of the continent,
</p>
<p>who, it was set forth, would be present. )
</p>
<p>Upon reaching the suburbs the stranger quickened
</p>
<p>his pace, and, passing through a dense grove of map-
</p>
<p>les, stood before the massive gates of St. Mary's
</p>
<p>Hospital.
</p>
<p>It was deep dusk, and the swinging porch-lamp
</p>
<p>impressed him cheerfully, as it flashed over the granite
</p>
<p>pillars, and lit up the graveled walks with a thousand
</p>
<p>tiny sparkles.
</p>
<p>St. Mary's was strictly a charity institution. Con-
</p>

</p>
<p>32 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>and the same impartial hand with which it administ-
</p>
<p>ered to the rich and rumerative. Stranger and citi-
</p>
<p>zen alike repaired to its peaceful wards, to bask in the
</p>
<p>restful shade, and be brooded for a lustrum of days
</p>
<p>in an atmorphere of soft speech, and under the liberal
</p>
<p>nursing of anticipating care.
</p>
<p>Over its grand entrance, in luminous characters,
</p>
<p>was the Latin motto, "Bes Est Sacra Miser" "A
</p>
<p>Suffering Person is a Sacred Thing"; and never had
</p>
<p>the testimony of its inmates compromised the grace
</p>
<p>and dignity of this noble paraphrase.
</p>
<p>"Am I right?" asked the physician, as soon as the
</p>
<p>usher answered his portal ring. "Is there a young
</p>
<p>lad here who was run over by the Governor's carriage
</p>
<p>this evening V "
</p>
<p>''Yes sir: if you mane a little hunchback."
</p>
<p>"Ah, yes," said the courteous stranger, as if solil-
</p>
<p>oquizing to himself. "I had forgotten that ! His
</p>
<p>mother and I never think him differently formed from
</p>
<p>other children, he is so good, so gentle, so dutiful !"
</p>
<p>and the usher, blushing at the rude bluntness of her
</p>
<p>words, hastened to repair, by adding:
</p>
<p>"Indade and indade, sir, he's as amiable a lad as
</p>
<p>one would wish to see ! And your son it is ? Troth !
</p>
<p>He's as like to you, as two pays in a pod!"

<p>answered the dignified stranger, who had now risen
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 33
</p>
<p>and stood nervously tapping his cane upon the marble
</p>
<p>floor of the reception-room, as his anxiety to know
</p>
<p>the worst gained full ascendancy, and the tedious
</p>
<p>blarney of the usher grew rasping and offensive.
</p>
<p>"Tell me," said the stranger sternly, "is the child
</p>
<p>hurt badly, and can I not see him at once ? "
</p>
<p>"Och sure ! and you can sir ; for it's niver a poor
</p>
<p>widder loike me, who would be afther kaping a fine,
</p>
<p>rich gintleman like yourself from his only lad. The
</p>
<p>poor little cratur looks more like wanting a good male
</p>
<p>of praties and buttermilk, than the loikes of the bitter
</p>
<p>thrash the doctor has been choking him with."
</p>
<p>Carlisle, physician as he was, could scarcely sup-
</p>
<p>press an audible smile at this parting shot of the gar-
</p>
<p>rulous Biddy, as she left him at the door of the con-
</p>
<p>valescent ward. *
</p>
<p>The apartment was as spacious, sunny and immac-
</p>
<p>ulately clean as though it had just been let down from
</p>
<p>some dustless realm, where sunshine and sweetness
</p>
<p>alone had homes, and the marring elements of dirt
</p>
<p>and darkness had no affiliating properties.
</p>
<p>The keen and practiced glance of Dr. Carlisle
</p>
<p>had, in one sweep of vision, taken in every appoint-

<p>ment of comfort, noted the number of convalescents
</p>
<p>and nurses, and discovered the object of his visit be-

</p>
<p>Seeing his child wrapped in sleep, he moved a chair
</p>
<p>up lightly to the side of the cot and gently pressed
</p>
<p>his fingers upon the slender girl-like wrist.
</p>
<p>"How long has he been sleeping?" was the whis-
</p>
<p>pered inquiry of the nurse.
</p>
<p>"An hour just," said the placid-faced sister, con-
</p>
<p>sulting the clock upon the mantel, which, in the im-
</p>
<p>pressive stillness of the room, seemed to be slashing
</p>
<p>out the moments with hammer and tongs.
</p>
<p>" I am the boy's father," pursued Dr. Carlisle.
</p>
<p>"Are his injuries serious? His pulse is a trifle flighty,
</p>
<p>but his skin is moist and natural."
</p>
<p>" No, sir; our hospital surgeon thoroughly exam-
</p>
<p>ined him, and beyond a few bruises he has escaped
</p>
<p>physical injury. The doctor, however, thought he had
</p>
<p>sustained a severe nervous shock and perhaps a slight
</p>
<p>concussion of the brain; but he has talked incessantly
</p>
<p>since coming out of the faint, and until the adminis-
</p>
<p>tered narcotic took effect, the beautiful young girl
</p>
<p>who saved him from a violent and terrible death was
</p>
<p>all his theme."
</p>
<p>"Who is this youthful beauty?" said Dr. Carlisle.
</p>
<p>"Well, really, I could not tell you, sir; there are so
</p>
<p>many conflicting rumors regarding her identity,
</p>
<p>whether mortal or celestial. She may be human; she
</p>
<p>may be an angel. Really, I deem the tale a mythical

<p>from St. Peter's holy lips; and he has booked her 'an
</p>
<p>angel.' However, if the sexton's angel and the girl
</p>
<p>in white who rescued your son, are one and the same,
</p>
<p>I am ready to discredit the statement regarding her
</p>
<p>ethereal origin."
</p>
<p>"She certainly rendered material aid in the instance
</p>
<p>of saving three precious lives, and I, for one, am her
</p>
<p>debtor henceforth," said Dr. Carlisle.
</p>
<p>Here the sister, at the suggestion of Dr. Carlisle,
</p>
<p>withdrew, and the fond father established his watch,
</p>
<p>insisting upon taking the entire care of his son till

<p>able to be removed.

<p>Having obtained the necessary material for letter-

<p>was several hundred miles to the eastward, regarding

<p>the accident to their son, his happy escape, and mat-

<p>ters of mutual interest; but we will take the liberty

<p>of looking over his shoulder before leaving St. Mary's,

<p>evening, but give yourself no uneasiness. He is not
</p>
<p>seriously hurt. I shall watch over him from this on
</p>
<p>very closely, not permitting him to be on the street
</p>
<p>save under my escort.
</p>
<p>This is a city of unbounded wealth and enterprise,
</p>
<p>but, like all new places, its extreme youth involves it
</p>
<p>in many weaknesses, and society is in a crude, chaotic
</p>
<p>state. The standard of one's social status is wealth.
</p>
<p>Wealth gives position; position merit, independent of
</p>
<p>brains or culture. The people holding the money are
</p>
<p>largely sporting characters, uncultured, ambitious
</p>
<p>only to accumulate wealth and out-dazzle their neigh-
</p>
<p>bors, snobbish, boorish and unrefined; their women
</p>
<p>coarse, shoddy, flashy and silly. A successful entree
</p>
<p>into Madame Grundy's "elite" circles (which seem to
</p>
<p>be guarded with the rake of jealousy and the pitchfork
</p>
<p>of malevolence ) depends entirely upon the conduct of
</p>
<p>your purse, not growth of soul or cultivation of heart.
</p>
<p>There are true people here good, kingly men and
</p>
<p>queenly women; but I am speaking of the dominant
</p>
<p>class, who hold the money and wield the social baton.
</p>
<p>Soto voce; express to me instanter the medalion
</p>
<p>locket. If I have not seen the veritable original, my
</p>
<p>memory illy serves me. Not the spirit of revenge,
</p>

</p>
<p>It was Saturday, the holiday of the busy school-
</p>
<p>room. Col. Veen's residence on Grand avenue looked
</p>
<p>unusually attractive, and well it might, since land-
</p>
<p>scape gardeners had been occupied over a week in
</p>
<p>preparing the magnificent grounds for this eventful
</p>
<p>date the eighteenth birthday of his only daughter,
</p>
<p>Cecile Laurene, one of the most brilliant pupils in the
</p>
<p>graduating class of the Mozart school.
</p>
<p>The mansion looked like a huge piece of statuary,
</p>
<p>wreathed in vines, with brilliant exotics dripping their
</p>
<p>blooms over its snowy window seats. On either side
</p>
<p>of the grand entrance, and peeping out between the
</p>
<p>Corinthian pillars supporting the open vestibule, were
</p>
<p>tall Parian flower vases, loading the air with the "sweet
</p>
<p>incense overflowing their velvet cups. Each floral
</p>
<p>dainty throughout the grounds had been coaxed into
</p>
<p>a farewell bloom, and luxuriant foliage beds deepened
</p>
<p>the unbroken carpet of green like gorgeous Persian
</p>
<p>rugs.
</p>
<p>From a polite morning hour till past midday the
</p>
<p>scene had been one of enchantment. A band of music
</p>
<p>stationed at the gates welcomed the guests, and con-

<p>gratulations, flowers and gifts were showered upon

</p>
<p>the modest head of their young recipient with a sin-
</p>
<p>cerity of manner which left no doubt in Col. Veen's
</p>
<p>mind of the love and esteem and social popularity of
</p>
<p>this daughter of his house.
</p>
<p>Cecile's companion-guests numbered an even hun-
</p>
<p>dred, and nearly all of them were the sons and daugh-
</p>
<p>ters of wealth. Col. and Mrs. Veen were the superi-
</p>
<p>ors of the majority of the wealthier class of St Saul.
</p>
<p>The Col. was a popular politician, a devoted consti-
</p>
<p>tuent of Gov. Kellogg' s, a man of liberal views, cor-
</p>
<p>rect principles, large-hearted and devoted to the loves
</p>
<p>of home. Of his two children one only son and
</p>
<p>daughter he was most justly proud.
</p>
<p>His wife, a handsome showy woman, had fair intel-
</p>
<p>lectual gifts, was clever in housewifery arts, good-
</p>
<p>hearted in the main, but possessing no deep religious
</p>
<p>convictions upon any subject; led by impulse and
</p>
<p>ordinary vanity, she was as a leaf tossed upon every
</p>
<p>passing breath of air sure to mount and fly away in
</p>
<p>a gale, with all the light rubbish aimlessly playing
</p>
<p>over the surface of solid and rooted things. As long
</p>
<p>as she held back her children with her in the idle
</p>
<p>pursuit of shadows, she lavished love and embel-
</p>
<p>lished their way with glittering splendors ; but as soon
</p>
<p>as they outgrew the follies and hollow vanities which
</p>
<p>narrowed them down, and perceived the difference

<p>between the shadow and substance of things, they
</p>
<p>40 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>were that moment introduced to the tree of life in the
</p>
<p>spiritual gardens of God; and no unconsecrated hand
</p>
<p>had power to pluck them back.
</p>
<p>Col. Veen's home was palatial in every sense, and
</p>
<p>artistically furnished throughout. After the lovers
</p>
<p>of the beautiful had made the rounds of its luxurious
</p>
<p>appointments, viewing paintings and statuary, they
</p>
<p>joined the out-door groups, engaged in games of cro-
</p>
<p>quet and archery until the sweet hostess announced
</p>
<p>the tables in waiting, when as by magic, the company
</p>
<p>in pairs filed through the marble porticos and into
</p>
<p>the dining salons.
</p>
<p>Cecile'seyes searched narrowly the long procession
</p>
<p>through. The search was futile! Pearl La Grange
</p>
<p>and Stanley Veen were not there !
</p>
<p>" Where can they be?" mentally queried Cecile;
</p>
<p>but proudly determining that no one else should miss
</p>
<p>them in the crowd, she hastened to place herself in
</p>
<p>the midst of her friends, where the munificence and
</p>
<p>elegance of the edibles absorbed the attention and
</p>
<p>gastrononlical abilities of all, and, surprising as it may
</p>
<p>seem, the handsome brother of Cecile was not called
</p>
<p>for. Only Mrs. Veen came around to Cecile's chair^
</p>
<p>asking for her brother; and Col. Veen noting the ab-
</p>
<p>sence of both Stanley and Pearl, concluded that they
</p>
<p>had strayed through the park and missed the banquet

<p>After the birthday feast, the palace was invitingly
</p>
<p>thrown open, from the four sides of its marble en-
</p>
<p>trances, to the grand out-looking galleries surround-
</p>
<p>ing the observatory, all aflame in the direct rays of
</p>
<p>the descending sun.
</p>
<p>The guests now flocked like so many chirping birds
</p>
<p>around their companion and hostess, taking affection-
</p>
<p>ate leave with the fresh and sweet sincerity of exu-
</p>
<p>berant girlhood. Cecile stood inclining her beautiful
</p>
<p>head, and smiling with all the frank heartiness of her
</p>
<p>sincere and artless nature, gazing from the porch
</p>
<p>through the wreathed gateway, where in merry groups
</p>
<p>her friends passed out and disappeared along the
</p>
<p>shaded avenue.
</p>
<p>At last realizing herself alone, she turned in the
</p>
<p>park, where the sunlight was throwing its good night
</p>
<p>kisses, and where she remembered to have seen Pearl
</p>
<p>and Stanley last. She had not proceeded far before
</p>
<p>she heard their voices and concealing herself behind
</p>
<p>the thick shrubbery which guarded the path, she
</p>
<p>waited till they were within reaching distance, then
</p>
<p>darting down the walk, she threw her arms caressingly
</p>
<p>around her sister-friend, and giving Stanley a re-
</p>
<p>proving glance the studied severity of which lost its
</p>
<p>force in the eyes' glad tenderness she cried:

</p>
<p>"Pearl shall decide that question, sister mine," and
</p>
<p>Stanley, gently parting their crossed hands, divided
</p>
<p>them and placed himself between them, looping his
</p>
<p>arms about them both in such a brotherly fashion
</p>
<p>that the serious proposition just made by Cecile, to
</p>
<p>break their circle, leaving Stanley out, seemed so pre-
</p>
<p>posterous, so impossible an act akin to their own
</p>
<p>severance from each other that the two girls, im-

<p>pressed alike with the absurdity of the thought,
</p>
<p>laughed loud and long together; indeed they did not
</p>
<p>cease their mirthful melody till Stanley, turning away
</p>
<p>from them said:
</p>
<p>"I'll anticipate my orders now; not wait as silly,
</p>
<p>passe actresses have done, to be hissed off the stage."
</p>
<p>"Cast Stanley off, indeed! " said Cecile, throwing

<p>her arms about her brother's neck and dragging him
</p>
<p>back. "We'll discuss that grave alternative when
</p>
<p>fairyland returns and darling brothers just like him
</p>
<p>are picked from every bush," and the sister kissed
</p>
<p>away the frown which a moment before sat like a
</p>
<p>cloud upon the clear heaven of his brow.

<p>enough. The sun disgusted threatens to desert us

<p>were you and what were your engagements let me

<p>see between the hours of twelve and five ? I've
</p>
<p>really had no perfect hapiness since first I missed you
</p>
<p>but in looking forward to our union; and this I've

<p>kept in store as one holds back their best sense
</p>
<p>through the dinner for the dessert. Come! Now for
</p>
<p>Komance, Strategy, and Spoils ! My appetite is keen
</p>
<p>and whetted with the steel of woman's curiosity."
</p>
<p>"Be seated then right here," said Stanley, "and you
</p>
<p>shall have my story. I too, await Miss Pearl's for by

<p>Ruby Clark were in the grotto. I saw them enter

<p>and I followed. Just then I heard three shots fired

<p>seems Pearl kept up with me, for when I called her

<p>name and turned she answered from the thicket near

<p>the bank and the tone of her voice alarmed me. I

<p>hat full of water which no sooner had I dashed over
</p>
<p>his face than lo ! two staring eyes, first questioned
</p>
<p>Pearl then me.
</p>
<p>"Where's your pistol? " said I, supposing he carried
</p>
<p>concealed weapons.
</p>
<p>" I - I - I ha' n't got any. Those men shot at me."
</p>
<p>"What men ? said I; and then in his poor stutter-
</p>
<p>ing style he told us he lived on the Dakota side of
</p>
<p>the river ; that his father had sent him over to the
</p>
<p>fort for a doctor in a little skiff and just as he was
</p>
<p>landing, two deserters from the fort ordered him to
</p>
<p>bring them to St. Saul ; that he had pleaded with them
</p>
<p>telling of his dying mother and the great need of
</p>
<p>instant help for her, but they only answered by push-

<p>ing him into tho boat and commanding him to row

<p>them quickly to St. Saul or they would drown him

<p>woods one said to the other: 'This brat will put a
</p>
<p>blood-hound on our track and dead men tell no tales,'
</p>
<p>and pulling out a revolver from the inside of his shirt
</p>
<p>he fired. The boy ran stumbled and fell upon reach-
</p>
<p>ing the opening and was then abandoned by the men
</p>
<p>who supposed they had killed him, but who had for-
</p>
<p>tunately given him only a slight flesh wound."
</p>
<p>"The fright and excitement of the strange incident
</p>
<p>and the sorrow he felt when he thought of his poor
</p>
<p>mother perhaps then beyond help completely
</p>
<p>crushed him. Pearl chafed his temples and with her
</p>
<p>handkerchief bound up his bleeding arm."
</p>
<p>"Now, said I to Pearl, you stay here till the boy is
</p>
<p>able to walk up to the house and I will go at once for
</p>
<p>officers to apprehend these men for they may do some
</p>
<p>bloody deed to-night, if not at once arrested."
</p>
<p>"I did my errand and the men are now behind the

<p>bars. When I came back I thought to find Pearl with
</p>
<p>you at the house but had no sooner reached the lower

<p>moving as though she too were pursued. I had only

<p>caught up with her and told of my successful capture

<p>of the men when you sprang out in the fashion of an

<p>and to-morrow will insert a card in the papers to that
</p>
<p>effect for this city's fame for gossip is a current
</p>
<p>topic in the moon."
</p>
<p>Pearl would have been glad could her story have
</p>
<p>been related by another and she beyond its hearing.
</p>
<p>She had no self-esteem other than a certain nobleness
</p>
<p>of dealing with herself which inspired a deference
</p>
<p>amounting almost to the homage one unconsciously
</p>
<p>bestows upon an object of universal sacredness; nor
</p>
<p>would she deal in personalities. The record of her
</p>
<p>life was kept as one would keep a volume choicely

<p>bound. Its leaves were never to be turned and criti-
</p>
<p>cized, dog-eared and thumbed by hands which only

<p>minister to curious eyes.

<p>Now for the first time, Pearl was forced to speak of

<p>herself as she saw the false light in which she stood

<p>before Col. and Mrs. Veen and all the grand, great

<p>to the boy's limbs he burst into an uncontrollable fit
</p>
<p>of crying. I could not pacify him unless I took him
</p>
<p>home; so I promised him if he would stop crying and
</p>
<p>be a brave good boy, that I would go back with him
</p>
<p>to the fort, get the surgeon and go into his father's
</p>
<p>presence, explaining the whole affair, and so ward off
</p>
<p>the ' terrible licking ' he insisted was in preparation
</p>
<p>for him ; and really, I saw quite a respectable wood-
</p>
<p>pile of lithe willow sticks all trimmed, which the boy
</p>
<p>assured me as he pointed them out lying by the door-
</p>
<p>step of his shanty, ' were all to be broken up over
</p>
<p>him.'
</p>
<p>"I luckily was able to do a little more by way of
</p>
<p>insuring his poor, starved looking little body from
</p>
<p>abuse. I had my half-term's tuition money from
</p>
<p>Ruby Clark received last night and I gave his
</p>
<p>father the amount, telling him the money was for the
</p>
<p>boy's great service to the country in securing, as he
</p>
<p>did by going to St. Saul, the arrest of these wicked
</p>
<p>men. I should be glad to know the sticks I saw were
</p>
<p>burned, and no others to be gathered for such inhu-
</p>
<p>man purposes, for the child looked worthy of a better
</p>
<p>fate and a better father.

<p>given her medicine, the boy was left in charge, and

</p>
<p>sorbed in this unexpected journey of mine; nor did I
</p>
<p>flatter myself that I should be missed, save by my
</p>
<p>own dear Cecile. No one has suffered but the little
</p>
<p>boy.
</p>
<p>"It makes me wretched to look into such a home-
</p>
<p>less home as his is, and then see the lavish hand of
</p>
<p>wealth conferring on itself these superfluities they
</p>
<p>rack imagination to invent, and class among their
</p>
<p>wants."
</p>
<p>Stanley and Cecile both agreed with Pearl, that
</p>
<p>when the privilege of handling money in great sums
</p>
<p>should come to them, the world would be lit up in the
</p>
<p>dark corners first, regardless of the heartless crowds
</p>
<p>who sunned themselves by centralizing the life forced
</p>
<p>of heaven's commonwealth, and seizing the handmaid
</p>
<p>of nature to warp the royal purposes of God.
</p>
<p>Silence fell upon the trio after Pearl, finishing her
</p>
<p>story, had asked Cecile' s forgiveness for the unpre-
</p>
<p>meditated anxiety she had caused her ; and now while
</p>
<p>the glories of the setting sun are framing them all, as

</p>
<p>contrast to the other, the selection could not have
</p>
<p>been more pleasing to the eye of an artist.
</p>
<p>Stanley Veen was just twenty; manly, without being
</p>
<p>coarsely masculine in that absolute sense which would
</p>
<p>have drawn the line of sex too strongly to admit of
</p>
<p>that exalted companionship existing between himself,
</p>
<p>his sister Cecile and Pearl LaGrange. The tie was
</p>
<p>so inseparable which bound the three, that the girls
</p>
<p>had never been capable of leaving Stanley out of their
</p>
<p>fond thoughts of each other; and the fact of his being
</p>
<p>a separate entity, in any shape than that which made
</p>
<p>them all individuals, never dawned upon their minds.
</p>
<p>So their lives flowed on as peacefully and as delight-
</p>
<p>edly as the union of three singing rivulets in one all-
</p>
<p>beauteous stream, within whose clear depths the hea-
</p>
<p>ven of stars lay mirrored, and upon whose surface
</p>
<p>the storms of life have never beaten, to wash down
</p>
<p>from its frowning shores, one earth stain, one dark
</p>
<p>shadow.
</p>
<p>Stanley was very tall, with that slenderness which
</p>
<p>follows rapid growth, yet well proportioned. His hair
</p>
<p>of raven blackness in its abundance did not conceal
</p>
<p>his well shaped head and closely chiseled ears. His
</p>
<p>forehead, broad with its reflected forces, introduced
</p>
<p>most pleasingly the frank face with its brown, Italian
</p>
<p>tint and fiery dark eyes. There was an impression of

<p>power and strength those latent forces one conceives

</p>
<p>of shudderingly in looking through a cage which holds
</p>
<p>a sleeping lion in scanning closely the face of Stan-
</p>
<p>ley Veen. Yet, with these elements of moral great-
</p>
<p>ness so grand in manhood, there was in his presence
</p>
<p>and manner and in his rich melodious voice, unmis-
</p>
<p>takable evidences of a delicacy and refinement in soul-
</p>
<p>texture, which puzzled greatly the true analysis, and
</p>
<p>left one always doubting if they knew the man. Upon
</p>
<p>his real character and nobleness, the reader shall pass
</p>
<p>judgment soon.
</p>
<p>Cecile, his sister, shared his stronger qualities to a
</p>
<p>degree which made her presence a magnet of power
</p>
<p>if there was anything to be decided upon demanding
</p>
<p>instant action; and her clear-sightedness never misled
</p>
<p>herself or her friends.
</p>
<p>These qualities gave both sister and brother that
</p>
<p>self-poise, independence and correct thinking and act-
</p>
<p>ing, which are the necessary concomitants of symet-
</p>
<p>rical souls.
</p>
<p>Cecile' s complexion though fairer than her broth-
</p>
<p>er's was not pure blonde, but had a marble smooth-
</p>
<p>ness which with its extreme palor, made her dark eyes
</p>
<p>flash with starry splendor, and the choral red of a
</p>
<p>most perfect mouth a very Cupid's bow seemed
</p>
<p>formed for words of love only; and when they
</p>
<p>parted in merry laughter, it was like the opening of a

<p>ruby casket to display its double row of pearls. If the
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 51
</p>
<p>ripeness of her lips stirred not the most indifferent
</p>
<p>nature to its depths, her smile and rippling laughter
</p>
<p>were positive enhancement, leaving upon the beholder
</p>
<p>a refreshing sensation, such as follows the quaffing of
</p>
<p>some health-giving draught
</p>
<p>Her hair seemed just the shade of Stanley's, save
</p>
<p>when, as now, set shimmering in the sun, when it re-
</p>
<p>vealed its gold and auburn strands, betraying the rich
</p>
<p>nature and warm passions of the soul.
</p>
<p>Col. and Mrs. Veen were justly proud of these two
</p>
<p>children, who seemed to have inherited the stronger,
</p>
<p>better qualities of both, only in greater measure than
</p>
<p>belonged to them combined. Wealth courted, and
</p>
<p>the ruling circles of fashion claimed them, but res-
</p>
<p>pectfully acknowledging the supremacy of both, in an
</p>
<p>ephemeral sense, they were controlled by neither, but
</p>
<p>soared above as eagles may in a flock of cawing crows.
</p>
<p>Both stood heart-whole against the fawning briber-
</p>
<p>ies of the world, yet without haughtiness that ele-
</p>
<p>ment of snobbishness which erects its brainless head,
</p>
<p>flaunts its pride-inflated person against the plainer
</p>
<p>skirts of good society, and screams, fish-woman like,
</p>
<p>for homage.
</p>
<p>It would have pleased the mother of Cecile and
</p>
<p>Stanley Veen if they had toned their towering aspi-
</p>
<p>rations somewhat within the utmost limits of her tol-

<p>around their garment's hem; but the children mani-
</p>
<p>fested wonderful tact in avoiding an open rebellion by
</p>
<p>steering clear of both extremes, and holding firmly to
</p>
<p>the middle ground, the golden mean where wisdom
</p>
<p>leads, and "all her paths are pleasantness and peace."
</p>
<p>Thus had they grown up side by side together, and
</p>
<p>now were towers of strength. They won their fath-
</p>
<p>er's sympathy their mother's awe.
</p>
<p>Pearl LaGrange was heart and soul their counter-
</p>
<p>part, yet with none of the moral combative element
</p>
<p>so largely developed in her beloved associates the
</p>
<p>shining qualities which were so soon to be tried for
</p>
<p>her sake in that fiery crucible which never fails to eli-
</p>
<p>minate solid gold from sordid brass.
</p>
<p>Pearl was a mirror of sweet innocence and loveliness,
</p>
<p>in which the good and pure and true and child-confi-
</p>
<p>ding could forever see themselves finding no contra-
</p>
<p>diction, no passion plague-marks; none of the little
</p>
<p>festering pimples of envy and jealousy; no conscious-
</p>
<p>ness of being anything more than a dutiful daughter
</p>
<p>and a devoted friend ambitious to advance herself
</p>
<p>and to carry with her all she loved.
</p>
<p>To say that she was beautiful conveys no adequate
</p>
<p>expression of her loveliness. Her presence inspired
</p>
<p>the most elevated sentiments which the human soul
</p>
<p>is capable of entertaining. There was a complete-

</p>
<p>fastidious devotees of beauty, and in the ripeness of
</p>
<p>her personal charms the " solid curves of healthful
</p>
<p>strength and painless nerves."
</p>
<p>Fair skinned, the rich bloom of her cheeks and lips
</p>
<p>reminded one of ripened peaches which the sun and
</p>
<p>air alone had toyed with, and which at slightest touch
</p>
<p>of finger tips, would shed their blooms and bathe you
</p>
<p>in their velvet atmosphere.
</p>
<p>Her eyes were large, full orbed and never to be
</p>
<p>named in color; but changing with the shades of
</p>
<p>thought and feeling, were chamelion windows for the
</p>
<p>soul to flash unlanguaged volumes through all the
</p>
<p>pent fountains of a woman's tenderness and tears;
</p>
<p>her dreams, her worship in the ideal realms of human
</p>
<p>love and happiness; the spell of music, poetry and
</p>
<p>art; a most unselfish nature, full of sacrificial strength,
</p>
<p>silent endurance all spiritual emotions which like
</p>
<p>sunlight on clear streams, sparkle the heaven of wis-
</p>
<p>dom.
</p>
<p>Pearl's hair was a rich chestnut, warm with bronze
</p>
<p>gold glintings in the sun. Glossy and waving, it had
</p>
<p>but to be released from bondage of the comb, when it
</p>
<p>would fall in ringlets to her belt.
</p>
<p>Her form just matched the glory of her eyes; and
</p>
<p>in the faultless features of her face the stamp of an-
</p>
<p>gelhood still lingered as though on guard, to say to

<p>some flatteries, which often mask unholy purposes at
</p>
<p>heart: "If you would worship at this shrine of purity,
</p>
<p>shake off the vulgar dust of promiscuities; wash in
</p>
<p>those waters known to cleanse from sin. The temple
</p>
<p>of a woman's honor is as holy as God's altar, and he
</p>
<p>who would profane the sacred casket, planned for
</p>
<p>God's begotten germs of immortality, first desecrate
</p>
<p>the altars of His sanctuary, that the descent may be
</p>
<p>less shocking to His wisdom's ordering."
</p>
<p>As in a garden of choice shrubs and in the bloom
</p>
<p>of roses, there is to the trained eye room for selection,
</p>
<p>so amid a multitude of women, young and beautiful,
</p>
<p>Pearl would have shown resplendent, the ripe color of
</p>
<p>her cheeks and lips and the harmonious blending of her
</p>
<p>simple dress and gentle manners, making her a queen
</p>
<p>among the regal beauties of the place, from the crown
</p>
<p>of her Greek head to the soles of her well arched feet.
</p>
<p>Slender, yet fully developed, and with an air of vol-
</p>
<p>uptuous strength, she trod the earth unconscious of
</p>
<p>her wealthy womanhood.
</p>
<p>Yet she was human and her weakness was that she
</p>
<p>had love's divine capacities, and could not live, no
</p>
<p>more than fountain play without this vitalizing wine

<p>of life.

</p>
<p>As the bells of St. Mark's rang out for vespers, Pearl
</p>
<p>started, leaped to her feet and said:
</p>
<p>" What! Have I been dreaming? I must go home
</p>
<p>instantly. The vesper bells never found me away
</p>
<p>from my father since sweet mother died."
</p>
<p>"I think you called him better to-day, did you not?"
</p>
<p>said Stanley.
</p>
<p>"O no!" said Pearl, "he has bright days, but he
</p>
<p>has failed most signally since auntie came."
</p>
<p>"Indeed!" said Cecile, "I am sorry. Poor dear!
</p>
<p>He's so patient too."
</p>
<p>"My father! "said Pearl. "My blessed father!
</p>
<p>The angel of patience could take new lessons at his

<p>bedside daily."
</p>
<p>" What can I do for you dear Pearl? Stanley and
</p>
<p>I, you know, can come at any time," said Cecile.
</p>
<p>"Nothing!" said Pearl. "The doctor told papa
</p>
<p>yesterday he had exhausted every remedy and he must

<p>now look to the Physician of Souls."
</p>
<p>" But we must help you Pearl; and we shall by dint

<p>The hour is midnight, intensly chill with dashes of

<p>sharp sleet driven before the wintry blasts.
</p>
<p>The streets, under a deep fall of snow, sparkle and

</p>
<p>It was a night to make home-loving hearts thankful
</p>
<p>for blazing hearth, and sideboard cheer.
</p>
<p>Vainly the storm hurled its missiles of hail and
</p>
<p>dashed its mighty gusts of wind against the solid
</p>
<p>casements of the rich. It only made weird music
</p>
<p>in the wakeful poet's soul or rocked in slumbers more
</p>
<p>profound the peaceful sleepers who occupied their
</p>
<p>silken couches and passed the hours in dreamless rest;
</p>
<p>and yet, dear reader if you have tasted life and have
</p>
<p>not realized that wealth and poverty are relative terms;
</p>
<p>that one man's affluence may be another's penury and
</p>
<p>that the choicest gathering of treasures, the most
</p>
<p>skilled 'outlay of \vealth in visible surroundings of
</p>
<p>pomp and grandeur may hide but stalking skeletons
</p>
<p>of abject misery, presenting so many rasping mock-
</p>
<p>eries to the slow death of their life-imprisoned in-
</p>
<p>mates, you have seen little of the inner and real
</p>
<p>experiences of this two-fold existence of ours end
</p>
<p>reasoned less upon its infinite dissimilarities and
</p>
<p>phases.
</p>
<p>But the night is too inclement to parley longer
</p>
<p>within its freezing altitudes.
</p>
<p>The solitary figure of a man bravely facing the
</p>
<p>elements on such a night and at such an hour, and
</p>
<p>threading the more retired and palatial aisles of St.

<p>Saul justifies our pursuit at a respectful distance.

<p>and into the spaeious grounds of Terrace Hill. Solid
</p>
<p>walls of snow flank the marble walks leading to the

<p>castle which stands grandly distant looming in solemn

<p>splendor and ghost-like as an isolated tomb amid tall

</p>
<p>The hall is roomy; the ceiling lofty and richly de-
</p>
<p>corated. On either side are marble busts of the

<p>greatest men of the Roman world. The furniture of
</p>
<p>the entire ground floor is antique in style and in its

<p>elegant simplicity and harmony with the architecture

<p>Tall, proudly erect and perfectly proportioned with

<p>just the slightest hint of embonpoint, sufficient to
</p>
<p>arrest the tendency of any abruptness in outline the
</p>
<p>Governor in review impresses one as a host within

<p>himself.
</p>
<p>His dress is rich though simple. The deep and
</p>
<p>meditative stillness of the dark eyes, the endless good

<p>feeling and friendliness in the lines of the handsome

<p>mouth, as well as the air of culture about the whole

<p>the impression made by the appearance of the abode

<p>Before his official distinction, Cassius Kellogg had
</p>
<p>won laurels as a jurist, was a brilliant orator and had

<p>made some notable accessions to the classic literature

<p>of the day.

</p>
<p>Even the fire had burned to ashes in the grate, and

<p>the stillness and coldness of death had settled upon
</p>
<p>every inanimate appointment of luxury and comfort.
</p>
<p>Those household gods instinctive with lif e,and so many

<p>of tireless love, looked down upon this weary man,

<p>pitiful and neglected as themselves, from their shad-

</p>
<p>Was the palace empty? No! Except of love! In

<p>Gross and plethoric with high living, dull and brain-

<p>nor an affectional link which put her en rapport

<p>with sentient life anywhere.

</p>
<p>There is a familiar proverb that " love is full of

<p>jealousy." In this case the proverb was not applica-

<p>ble, as the image of love was broken leaving jealousy
</p>
<p>alone intact.
</p>
<p>Devoid of affection and too coarse and stolid for
</p>
<p>sentiment, the wife of Governor Kellogg indulged
</p>
<p>her jealousies from a sort of fiendish selfishness and
</p>
<p>dog-in-the-manger gluttonness, to monopolize and ap-

</p>
<p>Obtuse and inert mentally she exhibited an amount
</p>
<p>of energy and bestial cunning in conducting her social
</p>
<p>intrigues and shrewdness in the concealment of her
</p>
<p>cloven-footed motives therein, which kept her ever
</p>
<p>upon the alert, lest inadvertently, she should compro-
</p>
<p>mise her own position in her eagerness to unsettle
</p>
<p>another's
</p>
<p>To say this woman had no redeeming traits of
</p>
<p>character would be subscribing to the horrible belief
</p>
<p>in "total depravity."
</p>
<p>She lived as many of the children of wealth and
</p>
<p>vanity do, upon a purely animal plane and the spirit-
</p>
<p>ual side of her nature so indispensable in the bal-
</p>
<p>ance of all true womanhood was darkened (let us
</p>
<p>hope not lost. )
</p>
<p>Her associations were similar in type and mental-
</p>
<p>ity with herself. Her masculine strength was matched
</p>
<p>by powerful influential qualities amounting to absol-
</p>
<p>ute magnetism while her position, as the wife of Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Kellogg gave her the leading role in a "society"
</p>
<p>whose polished corner stone was wealth and snobbery
</p>
<p>and whose rule was nothing less than civil despotism.
</p>
<p>Growing wider and wider apart daily, the uplifting

</p>
<p>pate the capacities for ruin which crouched like a lion
</p>
<p>in its lair, when this woman reclined upon her downy
</p>
<p>couch. He felt the chains of the law which bound
</p>
<p>him to her, but his official duties and the congenial
</p>
<p>associates of his profession kept him in an orbit of
</p>
<p>his own; while his wife with her nebulous retinue,
</p>
<p>trailed the earth-edges of the horizon below.
</p>
<p>Morning broke over the city, clear and gloriously
</p>
<p>bright. The Governor upon entering the dining-room
</p>
<p>at an early hour observed a note addressed to his wife
</p>
<p>with the underscored words in the corner of the en-
</p>
<p>velope : "In death haste."
</p>
<p>Thinking this justified his breaking the seal before
</p>
<p>disturbing his wife and perhaps thus sparing her the
</p>
<p>rude shock of its contents he hastily tore the wrapper,
</p>
<p>and read:
</p>

<p>Honored Lady:
</p>
<p>You will perhaps pardon

</p>
<p>the loss of a $100.00 note at the Governor's mansion
</p>
<p>a little more than one year ago, when I tell you my
</p>
<p>daughter is dying and implores me to make this last

<p>gained notoriety, Celia has been able to earn but lit-

</p>
<p>your suspicions from the public until thorough search
</p>
<p>had been made (or accepted her proposition to restore
</p>
<p>the money to you as she earned and was able to spare
</p>
<p>it from her living expenses,) gladly would she have
</p>
<p>rewarded you with the free labor of her hands. The
</p>
<p>withdrawal of confidence and the published account
</p>
<p>of her disgrace bandied from lip to lip in families
</p>
<p>whose patronage had been her support and the sup-
</p>
<p>port of her aged mother entirely crushed her.
</p>
<p>The French modiste, recently in your employ, as-
</p>
<p>sured me she had found the note (embedded in dust,
</p>
<p>yet unhurt) behind your marble dresser.
</p>
<p>In the name of humanity's God, and as you value
</p>
<p>your immortal soul, I beseech you to exonerate her
</p>
<p>now if peradventure it be not too late to bring her
</p>
<p>back to life. A simple word declaring her innocence
</p>
<p>which I can read to her upon her return to conscious-
</p>
<p>ness is all I ask. Oh grant it, that her death may
</p>
<p>not rest like a shadow upon your happy threshold!
</p>
<p>In distress I am

<p>Tour obedient servant,

<p>HANNAH WARD.
</p>
<p>The Governor stood as if riveted to the spot for
</p>
<p>some moments and an expression of pain passed over
</p>
<p>his fine face and trembled upon his sensitive lips.
</p>
<p>"Poor, innocent girl!" said he. "I wonder how

<p>a given caterwaul from Madame Grundy's elect par-
</p>
<p>agons severely virtuous and severely ugly. This
</p>
<p>persecution bears investigation. The girl is pretty
</p>
<p>and youthful, which is ample testimony for her con-
</p>
<p>viction of any and all crimes in the decalogue with
</p>
<p>that trio of old maids over the way and the Madame
</p>
<p>too, if I mistake not." Ringing the bell for the
</p>
<p>chambermaid, the Governor pushed the note under
</p>
<p>his plate and drew up to the breakfast table.
</p>
<p>"Mary," said the Governor, "tell Mrs. Kellogg I
</p>
<p>wish to see her on particular business before I go to
</p>
<p>the Capitol. If she will postpone the details of her
</p>
<p>toilet, and breakfast with me this morning, I will
</p>
<p>greatly appreciate it."
</p>
<p>The servant disappeared with the unusual request,
</p>
<p>and Mrs. Kellogg and the breakfast were announced
</p>
<p>together.
</p>
<p>Holding out the note to his wife and explaining his
</p>
<p>motives in its interception, the Governor watched her
</p>
<p>countenance closely, which paled and flamed alter-
</p>
<p>nately as she perused the touching appeal.
</p>
<p>The feelings uppermost in her heart and visibly
</p>
<p>portrayed in her changing color, were entirely those
</p>
<p>of disappointment and rage, that the letter should
</p>
<p>have fallen into her husband's hands, and with it, one

<p>of her society escapades, which she supposed strangled

</p>
<p>" The ridiculous thing! " said Mrs. Kellogg. " The
</p>
<p>idea, that I should identify the discovered bank note
</p>
<p>from underneath my dresser, as the money lost one
</p>
<p>year ago, which I am positive Celia Ward niched from
</p>
<p>my pocketbook lying on my bureau, the last day she
</p>
<p>sewed for me."
</p>
<p>" It was the same denomination, I believe, was it
</p>
<p>not?" quietly asked the Governor.
</p>
<p>" Yes ; but that fact establishes nothing!" retorted
</p>
<p>Mrs. Kellogg, with a wanton toss of her head.
</p>
<p>" It strikes me further " said the Governor, " that
</p>
<p>this room in which the bill has just been recovered by
</p>
<p>the French dressmaker, lias not been occupied by
</p>
<p>either of us till you returned to it on the day prior to
</p>
<p>the finding of the money not since Celia Ward pre-

<p>pared your wardrobe for Washington. Do not do

<p>such great discredit to your memory. The Ward fam-

<p>ily are poor, but I believe highly respectable. I think

<p>it would be better to give the poor girl the life-lease

<p>she is yearning for. It will only be rectifying a cruel
</p>
<p>wrong, and as my wife I request you to do this at
</p>
<p>once, and I will post it on my way down town."
</p>
<p>"Never! Let the girl die! The affair is none of

<p>mine. I should look well going around among my

<p>friends and posting hills for her reinstatement. She

</p>
<p>"No, no! You cannot fasten another crime upon
</p>
<p>this defenseless girl who never wronged you! I knew
</p>
<p>her father, and I know the widow Ward, and I will
</p>
<p>defend her purity against all your society slanders."
</p>
<p>And the Governor arose and paced the floor excitedly.
</p>
<p>" Write the note at once as I dictate, or I'll close
</p>
<p>my doors upon this ' bon ton society ' of yours and
</p>
<p>expose its hollowness and professional intriguing from
</p>
<p>A to izzard. It is a banded aristocracy of homely
</p>
<p>ill-shaped women, crusaders upon beauty, loveliness
</p>
<p>and innocence." And the Governor, pale with passion,
</p>
<p>rang for the servant.
</p>
<p>" Tell Charlie to come to me at once," and turning
</p>
<p>to his wife he said:
</p>
<p>" Make haste Madame, and repair this wrong before
</p>
<p>death makes the effort futile. The foul slander has
</p>
<p>hung about your skirts so long that the castle smells
</p>
<p>of rotting corpses! Here, I'll write the affidavit for

<p>your full signature. Read this and sign. I dare not
</p>
<p>trust your pen to copy truth ! It is as dead a lang-
</p>
<p>uage on your tongue, as love-smiles on your lips."
</p>
<p>The woman uttered not an extenuating word. Si-
</p>
<p>lently, and like a statue she obeyed the man whose
</p>
<p>frown made her very soul tremble. Her name affixed
</p>
<p>she withdrew, and the Governor's coachman appear-

</p>
<p>The boy disappeared and the door bell rang. The
</p>
<p>Governor's perturbed state of mind caused him to or-
</p>
<p>der the girl from his presence and answer the bell in
</p>
<p>person. It was the postman, and among his letters
</p>
<p>was one bearing a foreign stamp. It read as follows:
</p>
<p>"To THE HON. CASSIUS KELLOGG,
</p>
<p>St. Saul, U. S. A,
</p>
<p>Dear Sir:
</p>
<p>In one of our western exchanges I noticed some
</p>
<p>time ago an advertisement, dated from the Executive
</p>
<p>Chamber at St Saul, offering a reward for informa-
</p>
<p>tion concerning the young girl who so miraculously
</p>
<p>and bravely saved the lives of the Governor and his
</p>
<p>lady, and a young stranger, but who disappeared from
</p>
<p>that moment and eluded further publicity. As my
</p>
<p>beloved son, Hugh Carlisle, is the stranger alluded to,
</p>
<p>I have taken no little pains to ascertain the identity
</p>
<p>of the fair heroine whose modesty was only equaled by
</p>
<p>her courage, and I have the honor of transmitting you
</p>
<p>her name just obtained after a year's industrious ef-
</p>
<p>fort.
</p>
<p>I am sir, with high respect,
</p>
<p>Yours very truly,

</p>
<p>At this juncture Mrs. Kellogg came into the library,
</p>
<p>and passing her husband who seemed absorbed with
</p>
<p>the contents of a letter spread out before him, stooped
</p>
<p>and picked from the carpet by his chair, a card unob-
</p>
<p>served, and disappeared with it through the library
</p>
<p>door.
</p>
<p>"Well, this is surely a most extraordinary letter!
</p>
<p>If it were the first day of April I would consider my-
</p>
<p>self the best fooled man in America," said the Gover-
</p>
<p>nor aloud as he sank into an easy chair to await the
</p>
<p>messenger.
</p>
<p>After a lapse of thirty minutes in which the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor was occupied vainly endeavoring to solve the
</p>
<p>mystery, the library door again opened and Charlie
</p>
<p>appeared with a note from Mrs. Ward, thanking the
</p>
<p>Governor and his lady, but regretting the coveted
</p>
<p>words should have come too late to save the life of her
</p>
<p>child who had just expired. However, the note should
</p>
<p>be laid upon her bosom that all might know that she
</p>
<p>died above reproach.
</p>
<p>Stanley Veen was here announced, and being shown
</p>
<p>into the library drew his chair close to the Governor's,
</p>
<p>and taking a small package from the inside pocket of
</p>
<p>his coat, proceeded to unwrap it very carefully.
</p>
<p>"To-day is a day of surprises," said the Governor.

<p>" What have you brought me ? Some more geologi-

<p>cal specimens I suppose. You have really contribu-
</p>
<p>70 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>ted some of the finest fossils I have in my collection.
</p>
<p>" I have something entirely different to offer you to-
</p>
<p>day my dear Governor, and for the first time in my
</p>
<p>life I am a peddler of choice goods, something in the
</p>
<p>line of real gems such as your wife has a decided pen-
</p>
<p>chant for, and which an indulgent husband like your-
</p>
<p>self, will delight to purchase for her I know."
</p>
<p>" Why, my dear boy, when did you adandon the
</p>
<p>study of your profession to become a jewel merchant? "
</p>
<p>" If you are too curious," said Stanley, " I shall
</p>
<p>take them where no questions will be asked."
</p>
<p>"Ah! Then they are smuggled goods," said Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Kellogg playfully.
</p>
<p>" They are nothing of the kind," said Stanley, un-
</p>
<p>locking an elegant plush casket and exposing a satin
</p>
<p>lined tray upon whose gorgeous tinted ground a su-
</p>
<p>perb set of diamonds and opals flashed forth like a re-
</p>
<p>gal coronet nestling within the velvet heart of a rose.
</p>
<p>"Dazzling!" said the Governor. "They look as
</p>
<p>though they had never seen the light before, and
</p>
<p>might devour and reflect its rays till the atmosphere
</p>
<p>exhausted itself in keeping up the exchange of bril-
</p>
<p>liant courtesies."
</p>
<p>" They are beautiful," said Stanley, "and they are
</p>
<p>for sale. How much will you bid on them."

<p>" Really, one has to feel amiable to purchase luxu-

<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 71
</p>
<p>ries, and niy mood is a most unhappy one to-day,"
</p>
<p>said the Governor.
</p>
<p>" Then see here, dear Governor, these jewels must
</p>
<p>be sold to-night. Suppose I leave them with you, and
</p>
<p>you advance a sum upon them ? I do assure you that
</p>
<p>my object in asking this favor is in every way worthy
</p>
<p>your acquiesence."
</p>
<p>" I doubt it not, dear Stanley. I would give much
</p>
<p>more than the price of these diamonds to solve a mys-
</p>
<p>tery, now hunting me like the ghost of some restless
</p>
<p>grave-yard sleeper. To whom do I owe my own life
</p>
<p>and the Madame's? For that day both seemed
</p>
<p>doomed to a violent death but for the intercession of
</p>
<p>an unknown hand? Not to our guardian* angels',
</p>
<p>surely! miraculous as the rescue was; for more than
</p>
<p>a hundred eyes distinguished the form of a young
</p>
<p>girl afterwards lost in the crowds who flocked around
</p>
<p>us."
</p>
<p>Stanley's face flushed, observing which the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor immediately followed up the clew by saying:
</p>
<p>" Stanley Veen ! If this secret which has cocked
</p>
<p>every ear in St. Saul and baffled the ferreting noses
</p>
<p>of the three old spinsters over the way, is in your pos-
</p>
<p>session and the heroine is obscure in name and po-
</p>
<p>sition, you wrong the best instincts of your noble
</p>
<p>charities to keep back the deserved reward."

<p>ful for your valued kindnesses, advice and rare com-
</p>
<p>panionship, if I refuse, point blank, to give the name
</p>
<p>of the modest angel for she is more than human
</p>
<p>who was God's instrument in saving our beloved Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor and his good lady. Some time I may tell you
</p>
<p>all that I'm pledged to keep inviolate to-day."
</p>
<p>"Ah! Then the name and jewels are not strangers
</p>
<p>to each other. It is well ! Here is enough to keep out
</p>
<p>hungry wolves from any door and in these times, God
</p>
<p>knows the poor must suffer bitterly," said Governor
</p>
<p>Kellogg, as he placed in Stanley's hands a roll of bills,
</p>
<p>Stanley's starry eyes fairly danced with joy and
</p>
<p>gratitude, and the moisture of glad tears gemmed their
</p>
<p>long lashes as he proudly and carefully folded the new
</p>
<p>bills, placed them in a sealed envelope and tucked them
</p>
<p>into the depths of the pocket which had been but a
</p>
<p>few minutes before the repository for the casket of
</p>
<p>jewels, and his voice trembled perceptibly as he ex-
</p>
<p>tended his hand and said:
</p>
<p>" O how I thank you, good, dear Governor! Yes,
</p>
<p>from my heart, I thank you. The jewels are all yours.
</p>
<p>I could not ask for more! And for the blessings you

<p>unconsciously confer in this transaction may God's

<p>faithful witnesses make full recompense! "Tis safe

</p>
<p>" No thanks, my boy. My prayer is answered well.
</p>
<p>I should not like to see the sun set on to-day as on a
</p>
<p>common day of office toil to me, unless I felt I had
</p>
<p>in some small way made one of God's poor wretches
</p>
<p>the happier for my living. Good bye ! Give your fair
</p>
<p>sister and your mother my best compliments, and
</p>
<p>come again when you have kindred missions to ful-
</p>
<p>fill; for in the grove of selfish aims, one quite loses
</p>
<p>sight of the beatitudes of grace and charity. It makes
</p>
<p>one live again in the true sense to breathe the pure air
</p>
<p>scenting these good memories which you have brought
</p>
<p>me. Really I'm glad my official labors are so soon
</p>
<p>to end. The work is onerous and restoration to my
</p>
<p>profession looks second only to the reservation of a
</p>
<p>place in Heaven to me."
</p>
<p>" But you forget. Another term awaits the State's
</p>
<p>good Governor, beloved of all!"
</p>
<p>" Never! " said Kellogg. " My name is in advance
</p>
<p>withdrawn, and in such a manner as forever shuts out
</p>
<p>all controversy. Goodnight," and Stanley Veen passed
</p>
<p>out as though his feet were winged and floated him.
</p>
<p>Not once (as was his wont) glancing upon picture or
</p>
<p>statue framing his rich path through the grand draw-
</p>
<p>ing-rooms. On to the hall he passed, the glad light in
</p>

<p>Alone! Her soul took refuge in its God,
</p>
<p>And the three angels lent her innocence
</p>
<p>Truth, love and purity with these she trod
</p>
<p>Where honor led, and wrought its own defense!
</p>
<p>The curtains were drawn at the LaGrange cottage
</p>
<p>and the house looked asleep and deserted. As the
</p>
<p>yard was very small the gate only swung open upon
</p>
<p>a little vestibule of earth the merest margin of pro-
</p>
<p>tection against the turning of the white door knob,
</p>
<p>and ingress through its casement from the street.
</p>
<p>The look of gloom and desertion so changed the ex-
</p>
<p>terior of this humble domicile, that passing strangers
</p>
<p>who had been in the habit of taking in the fresh,
</p>
<p>sweet picture of its window- garden blooms from the
</p>
<p>street, looked wonderingly towards the closely drawn
</p>
<p>curtains and the apparent absence of all life within.

<p>No home is so humble, so circumscribed by the

</p>
<p>fidelity and family wretchedness to contend with in
</p>
<p>its rank, than is found elsewhere.
</p>
<p>But there is one guest whose unwelcome presence
</p>
<p>is alike manifest in the homes of both wealth and
</p>
<p>poverty; who is no respecter of persons. One who
</p>
<p>comes omitting the civilities of a ring at the portal;
</p>
<p>whom we would gladly bar out could mortal hand
</p>
<p>forge bolt or bar sufficient.
</p>
<p>There were sincere lives, and true devoted piety to
</p>
<p>be found among the inmates of theLaGrange cottage;
</p>
<p>and now, as one of its number was hovering upon the
</p>
<p>threshold of the two worlds its visible doors seemed
</p>
<p>opening out into the invisible gardens of God!
</p>
<p>For weeks the life of Robert LaGrange had hung
</p>
<p>upon a thread and the shaded lamp had burned the
</p>
<p>long night vigils through. The aged sister and the
</p>
<p>devoted daughter now never left his bedside.
</p>
<p>Though Cecile and Stanley, her noble friends, stood
</p>
<p>ever ready to relieve her in the watch, the yearning
</p>
<p>love and tender anxieties of Pearl, lest her father
</p>
<p>should die at an unexpected moment, kept her ever in
</p>
<p>his presence.
</p>
<p>Since her father had given up his chair at the front
</p>
<p>window Pearl had not left the house. To surround
</p>
<p>the sick man with the best influences and most cheer-

</p>
<p>bed-room into the one only commodious apartment
</p>
<p>of the cottage, and so located as to command a perfect
</p>
<p>view of the busy thoroughfares.
</p>
<p>Through its sunny south windows he could see the
</p>
<p>gay world as it whirled by in the gilded trappings of
</p>
<p>wealth and fashion. A panoramic view of which the
</p>
<p>old time mirror gave back reflectively, when his eyes
</p>
<p>weary of the light, turned toward the solid casement.
</p>
<p>The deep window seats were literally banked with
</p>
<p>flowers from among which delicate vines shot out and
</p>
<p>met in airy drapery above a life size portrait in oil of
</p>
<p>Pearl's sweet mother, Annie Boyd LaGrange.
</p>
<p>There was something indescribably pensive in the
</p>
<p>expression of the face of the picture, and to Pearl's
</p>
<p>poetical imagination it answered her in all her moods.
</p>
<p>In gazing upon it she wandered off into space, follow-
</p>
<p>ing the lead of her fancies as she traced the beauty
</p>
<p>paths through which her mother walked in paradise,
</p>
<p>and clothed her in the robes fit only for her angel
</p>
<p>loveliness to wear.
</p>
<p>The picture had jiot robbed her of that spirituality
</p>
<p>of expression, lost sight of by some artists in their too
</p>
<p>accurate lines for the delineations of beauty alone.
</p>
<p>The face was the embodiment of youthful vivacity
</p>
<p>and gentleness and so soft in its outlines that the oval

</p>
<p>and diffused their warm tints melting away mistily
</p>
<p>into the swell of the snowy bust.
</p>
<p>The portrait was executed by Powers and expressly
</p>
<p>to adorn his prize collection. He had seen Annie
</p>
<p>LaGrange with the infant Pearl in her arms sitting
</p>
<p>upon the rickety doorsteps of the old tenement house,
</p>
<p>which Pearl and her father had abandoned with all
</p>
<p>its sad memories upon the death of the mother and
</p>
<p>little Fra. Evening after evening did the infatuated
</p>
<p>lover of beauty stroll by that doorway till the picture
</p>
<p>was memorized and the sketch perfected. Years
</p>
<p>afterwards, during the early weeks of Robert La
</p>
<p>Grange's illness, Pearl, Cecile and Stanley strolled
</p>
<p>into a gallery but just thrown open to the public for
</p>
<p>the exhibition of masterpieces in oil.
</p>
<p>Upon an easel confronting Pearl as she entered this
</p>
<p>gallery was the portrait of her idolized mother. There
</p>
<p>could be no mistake in those eyes which looked into
</p>
<p>hers with the same old tenderness she had missed so
</p>
<p>long! She stood transfixed, and, though Stanley and
</p>
<p>Cecile passed on and Stanley returned again and
</p>
<p>again for her to join them in their, rounds she heard
</p>
<p>them not until they forcibly seized and dragged her
</p>
<p>away from the picture, when, recalling her surround-
</p>
<p>ings and pointing to it, she introduced them to her
</p>
<p>mother !

<p>Cecile and Stanley saw quickly the resemblance to
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 79
</p>
<p>Pearl, but assured her it must be accidental; however y
</p>
<p>Stanley promised he would learn its history and if the
</p>
<p>picture was traceable to any but an ideal source.
</p>
<p>One evening Pearl returned to her home to find the
</p>
<p>precious relic hers - the united gift of Stanley and
</p>
<p>Cecile Veen. In this remarkable manner had the
</p>
<p>living likeness of Annie LaGrange been restored to
</p>
<p>her family and the shadow of her angel presence come
</p>
<p>as if commissioned to sweep out another shadow, HOAV
</p>
<p>falling like the black wings of night across the
</p>
<p>threshold.
</p>
<p>The world again presented its dark side to Pearl
</p>
<p>LaGrange and fortune the second critical turning
</p>
<p>point in her destiny.
</p>
<p>Since establishing herself at her father's bedside
</p>
<p>Pearl had given up her class and the last earnings of
</p>
<p>Robert LaGrange were slowly melting away under the
</p>
<p>pressure of such daily needs as the filling out of the
</p>
<p>doctor's prescriptions the comforts which Pearl anti-
</p>
<p>cipated and obtained never counting the cost since
</p>
<p>it was her father's money which procured them. In-
</p>
<p>deed it was not until aunt Meg warned her of the
</p>
<p>limits of an already depleted pocketbook that Pearl
</p>
<p>realized the possibility of not being able to keep up
</p>
<p>the little table of luxuries which had stood at her
</p>
<p>father's bedside so long, tempting the failing appetite

<p>and delighting his child to supply at the self-sacrifi-
</p>

</p>
<p>cing price of her own and her old aunt's physical
</p>
<p>needs; for Pearl always insisted in her heart that
</p>
<p>her father, who was still young might yet be saved by
</p>
<p>the ministrations of love a comforting thought she
</p>
<p>repeated to herself mentally while assiduously main-
</p>
<p>taining her sleepless watch.
</p>
<p>It was upon the total dark of such a night-sorrow
</p>
<p>that daylight streamed in, enveloping the cottage, its
</p>
<p>mournful watchers and the white face of the dying La
</p>
<p>Grange in its generous flood of sunshine.
</p>
<p>In the morning of the day on which Stanley Veen
</p>
<p>made a business visit to the Governor's mansion, the
</p>
<p>expressman brought to the LaGrange cottage a pack-
</p>
<p>age addressed to Pearl. Upon turning and scanning
</p>
<p>the mysterious thing before breaking its foreign seal,
</p>
<p>Pearl's imagination fairly danced as she thought of
</p>
<p>the wonderful inheritance aunt Meg had assured her
</p>
<p>some day would fall to her share from the old manor
</p>
<p>house estate at Gascony; that this might be the first
</p>
<p>installment in answer to her father's claim of heir-
</p>
<p>ship, gave her heart a thrill of delight.
</p>
<p>She broke the seal and when she had torn off the
</p>
<p>wrappings, and with its enclosed key unlocked the
</p>
<p>casket containing the jewels already inspected by the
</p>
<p>reader as they sparkled upon the library writing ta-
</p>
<p>ble at the Governor's mansion, she was sure her pre-

</p>
<p>monitions were correct. The note, however, dispelled
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 81
</p>
<p>her illusions, and Pearl's eyes filled with tears of
</p>
<p>mingled disappointment and puzzled surprise at the
</p>
<p>strange answer to her prayers for help, and the sud-
</p>
<p>den dash of these, her most sanguine hopes for inde-
</p>
<p>pendence.
</p>
<p>Not until she had submitted the casket with its con-
</p>
<p>tents to Stanley Veen's inspection did she appreciate
</p>
<p>its value or the possibility of turning it into any prac-
</p>
<p>tical good whatever. She was tossed upon a limitless
</p>
<p>sea of speculation to know who had given her name
</p>
<p>to Dr. Carlisle, and why he should have honored her
</p>
<p>with so costly a gift.
</p>
<p>It was the most natural thing in the world for her
</p>
<p>to have saved the life of the poor little helpless hunch-
</p>
<p>back just as she did, and the most inhuman spectacle
</p>
<p>she had ever witnessed was furnished in the indiffer-
</p>
<p>ence manifested by the crowd regarding the four im-
</p>
<p>periled lives on that memorable day.
</p>
<p>While Pearl meditated upon these things the sick
</p>
<p>man slept and she awaited Stanley Veen. At last,
</p>
<p>placing her head upon the pillow beside her father's,
</p>
<p>overcome by extreme weariness and anxiety, she joined
</p>
<p>him in the realms of forgetfulness; nor did she hear
</p>
<p>the light step of Stanley, who stood gazing upon the
</p>
<p>picture of the two faces resting upon the same pillow.

</p>
<p>It was wan death and rosy health; and the contrast
</p>
<p>82 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>made Stanley Veen shudder, young and strong as he
</p>
<p>felt himself to be.
</p>
<p>The pale messenger had lingered long and love had
</p>
<p>been so tenderly alive to every need, the spirit could
</p>
<p>not break faith with its clay save by that insidious
</p>
<p>letting go of the life-hold which rather aggravates than
</p>
<p>spares the shock of death. And thus the urgent hour
</p>
<p>had come unrecognized. The strange, deep calm ; the
</p>
<p>unusual clearness of the mind; the freedom from
</p>
<p>pain, had all been construed into so many favorable
</p>
<p>intimations of rallying life powers.
</p>
<p>Aunt Meg had repaired to her room for the night
</p>
<p>and Pearl's heart beat lighter than it had for many
</p>
<p>weeks.
</p>
<p>Before Stanley Veen took the jewels to the Gover-
</p>
<p>nor, however, he had a long conversation with the doc-
</p>
<p>tor, and knew a few hours only remained to Pearl of
</p>
<p>her father's presence.
</p>
<p>While planning in his mind just how he should
</p>
<p>break the news to Pearl, a look of extreme weariness
</p>
<p>and pain passed over the face of the dying LaGrange.
</p>
<p>He opened his eyes and turned his head upon the
</p>
<p>pillow. Pearl leaped to her feet, crimson with con-
</p>
<p>fusion.
</p>
<p>" Why, Stanley Veen! " she said, "when did you
</p>
<p>come? How long I have beeen sleeping! "

</p>
<p>" Not long, dear heart," said Stanley, "your father
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 83
</p>
<p>has this moment wakened, and I have watched you
</p>
<p>both. You slept as though the lapse was novel to
</p>
<p>you, and you look so dead tired, Pearl."
</p>
<p>"But I am not," Pearl said. " It was sheer stupi-
</p>
<p>dity in me to fall asleep. See! How much brighter
</p>
<p>father looks for his rest. I call him so much better,
</p>
<p>too, to-day! "
</p>
<p>Stanley shook his head, and motioning her into
</p>
<p>another room, he said, very tenderly and in low tones:
</p>
<p>" I shall not leave you, Pearl, to-night, unless you
</p>
<p>drive me out. It is our place Cecile's and mine to
</p>
<p>help you to the end."
</p>
<p>"Whatl" said Pearl, paling as she caught the drift
</p>
<p>of Stanley's meaning, "you don't mean you do not
</p>
<p>think my father worse?"
</p>
<p>"I think," said Stanley, "really a great change has
</p>
<p>come over your father since yesterday, and greater
</p>
<p>still since my errand and return just now."
</p>
<p>Pearl sank into a chair and buried her face in her
</p>
<p>hands, while Stanley continued:
</p>
<p>"Dear Pearl, forgive my frankness!" You must
</p>
<p>be prepared to-night."
</p>
<p>"Oh, Stanley! My father will not die. He cannot
</p>
<p>leave me alone. No, no! If father dies then I re-
</p>
<p>nounce the world; I have nothing more to live for."
</p>
<p>" Say not so, Pearl. Aunt Meg is left and Cecile

</p>
<p>84 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>" Forgive me if I repeat the ingrate thought. I
</p>
<p>Jiave nothing more to live for."
</p>
<p>Stanley moved towards the door and Pearl roused
</p>
<p>herself.
</p>
<p>" You will not leave me, Stanley?"
</p>
<p>" Only to bring Cecile," he answered.
</p>
<p>" I want you both," said Pearl.
</p>
<p>" And both shall come," said Stanley, as he closed
</p>
<p>the outer door softly behind him.
</p>
<p>And Pearl, realizing the necessity for self control
</p>
<p>in the presence of her father, bathed her face off
</p>
<p>quickly, and with a forced smile on her lips entered
</p>
<p>his presence.
</p>
<p>Extending his wasted hand and feebly beckoning
</p>
<p>Pearl towards him, he said:
</p>
<p>" Come, Pearl, my child, are we alone? "
</p>
<p>"Yes, father."
</p>
<p>" I have something I must say to you before I go.
</p>
<p>No other ears must hear it."
</p>
<p>" But father, my own father, you are not going,"
</p>
<p>and Pearl, unable to control herself, burst into a par-
</p>
<p>oxysm of weeping and moaning.
</p>
<p>" My child! You will unnerve me. I need all my
</p>
<p>strength now, for the final moment is upon me, and
</p>
<p>my work done, or so nearly so that you may finish it.

<p>So bear up cheerfully sweet child. You quite forget

</p>
<p>old aunt Meg is here when I am gone, and with your
</p>
<p>class and health, and your pure trust in God, I give
</p>
<p>you all a father's confidence that you will live worthy
</p>
<p>the good name of both houses now bequeathed you at
</p>
<p>my death. It is your only fortune, and it will never
</p>
<p>take wings and fly away, as bags of gold have done.
</p>
<p>Pearl! Quickly! While I have my mind, get pen
</p>
<p>and paper and jot down verbatim what I have to say.
</p>
<p>Make haste, my daughter!"
</p>
<p>With streaming eyes Pearl obeyed, and soon an-
</p>
<p>nounced herself in readiness for his dictations.
</p>
<p>A sealed package was brought addressed to the
</p>
<p>Governor which Pearl sacredly promised her father to
</p>
<p>deliver herself, it being a matter of life and death to
</p>
<p>the parties concerned.
</p>
<p>With this sealed document LaGrange dictated the
</p>
<p>following note addressed to his excellency, Governor
</p>
<p>Kellogg, Executive Chamber, St. Saul.
</p>
<p>" I, Robert LaGrange, in dying, deem it my duty to

<p>prostration; that I might present it in person to your
</p>
<p>excellency. I am, sir,
</p>
<p>With great respect,
</p>
<p>Your obedient servant,
</p>
<p>ROBERT LAGBANGE."
</p>
<p>This note being signed in the trembling hand of the
</p>
<p>dying man, and Pearl having promised to carry the
</p>
<p>important package to the Governor immediately after
</p>
<p>the burial of her father, she carefully returned the
</p>
<p>papers to her father's desk, and thinking she discov-
</p>
<p>ered a new cause for alarm in his countenance, she
</p>
<p>poured out a glass of cordial, raised him in her arms
</p>
<p>and urged him to drink.
</p>
<p>It was not possible. He had exhausted the last
</p>
<p>spark of vitality in his effort to execute the trust
</p>
<p>which had been committed to him, and which had
</p>
<p>hung dependent upon this last thread of his existence,
</p>
<p>and would have been lost but for the rallying energies
</p>
<p>of a faithful heart.
</p>
<p>Pearl rushed into her old aunt's room and seizing

<p>her frantically, cried:
</p>
<p>" He is going, auntie! Father is dying! Oh, come

</p>
<p>had roused herself, draped a blanket hastily around

<p>her shoulders and entered the apartment, Pearl had

<p>taken her father up into her arms on the bed, as one

<p>lowed on her bosom, and her face pressed close to his,
</p>
<p>as if she could thus ward off the impending stroke
</p>
<p>and detain the spirit by the same power which ena-
</p>
<p>bled her to encircle the precious form within her
</p>
<p>strong and loving embrace.
</p>
<p>The countenance of the dying man was lighted up
</p>
<p>with a supernatural brilliancy of expression, and his
</p>
<p>large kind eyes beamed as though already feasting
</p>
<p>upon the restful verdure of the evergreen hills.
</p>
<p>Smiling tenderly upon old aunt Meg as she knelt at
</p>
<p>his bedside he said:
</p>
<p>"Sister, you will guard my poor orphan child?"
</p>
<p>"Aye, brother; as ye pit your trust in the Laird,
</p>
<p>you may count on your auld sister to watch over the
</p>
<p>bairnie Pearl. It has a' come to me what maun be

<p>" Pearl, sweet child, remember all I have told you.

<p>Be good; confide in and consult your auntie in all

<p>things, and may the God of the fatherless and of the

</p>
<p>" He's wi' your sainted mither and our ain bairnie
</p>
<p>Fra, a luking down on ye fra heaven," said aunt Meg.
</p>
<p>Pearl lifted his head, gazed long and earnestly upon
</p>
<p>the features now settling into the rigid expression of
</p>
<p>death.
</p>
<p>" O father! Speak once more to me! Just once! "
</p>
<p>she cried.
</p>
<p>But the spirit had taken its flight, so gently releas-
</p>
<p>ing itself from the embraces of love, that Pearl might
</p>
<p>have said she carried her father in her arms to the
</p>
<p>very gates of Paradise. No angel would have contra-
</p>
<p>dicted her statement.
</p>
<p>A half-hour passed. The fire burned low. The
</p>
<p>night winds lashed the naked grapevines against the
</p>
<p>outer casement as they beat out their mournful meas-
</p>
<p>ures to departing time.
</p>
<p>Another half -hour passed. The fire had burned to
</p>
<p>ashes, and the atmosphere of the cottage put on the
</p>
<p>temperature and stillness of death. Aunt Meg's face
</p>
<p>was yet buried in the bed-clothes and she had not
</p>
<p>risen from her knees. Pearl still clasped in her arms
</p>
<p>the lifeless form of her father! If the mourners had
</p>
<p>turned to stone they could not have been more motion-
</p>
<p>less, more silent; and the darkness which enveloped
</p>
<p>them was equally profound.

<p>" Stanley," said Cecile, " what does it mean, this
</p>
<p>darkness ? Are you sure this is the house ? "
</p>
<p>" Wait, Cecile. till J strike a match," and Stanley
</p>
<p>held up the tiny flame while they both peered through
</p>
<p>the darkness of the room."
</p>
<p>" Why yes; we are right. This is the little kitchen;
</p>
<p>there is Pearl's hat, just where she hung it last time
</p>
<p>we went together for the doctor; but listen! "
</p>
<p>" I hear nothing, Stanley. You make me tremble.
</p>
<p>Are you going in? "
</p>
<p>"I have turned the door-knob. All is darkness
</p>
<p>Cecile, I never was afraid before. I cannot hear a
</p>
<p>sound. Where are the lamps ? "
</p>
<p>" I have found a candle," whispered Cecile.
</p>
<p>" Light it quickly, and let's find out what the matter
</p>
<p>is."
</p>
<p>Stanley lighted the candle and Cecile followed him
</p>
<p>into the room, holding on to his arm and walking close
</p>
<p>behind him.
</p>
<p>Reader, can you imagine the picture? The room
</p>
<p>was an oblong, with low ceiling, a bed in the centre,
</p>
<p>and beside it the little table and a few chairs, which
</p>
<p>completed the furniture of the apartment.
</p>
<p>As Stanley held the light a little in advance of them,
</p>
<p>the central figure of the dead man propped up in the
</p>
<p>arms of Pearl was ghastly in the extreme. Cecile

<p>could hardly suppress a shriek of horror at the sight,
</p>
<p>90 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>aunt Meg seemed moaning and praying, and did not
</p>
<p>lift her head; while Pearl made no sign whatever, but
</p>
<p>seemed staring on vacancy. The expression of her
</p>
<p>eyes, and her deathly pallor startled Stanley.
</p>
<p>" Take the candle," said Stanley; "there is some-
</p>
<p>thing worse than death here. Look at Pearl!" and
</p>
<p>Stanley unlocked her arms and literally dragged her
</p>
<p>off the bed, letting the dead man fall back upon the
</p>
<p>pillow.
</p>
<p>"Quick! Give me something. Pearl is faint and
</p>
<p>cold" said Stanley.
</p>
<p>This roused aunt Meg, who bringing the cordial
</p>
<p>bottle, held it tightly corked to her white lips.
</p>
<p>"Ou, wae's me ! She's unco' ill ! Hadna we better
</p>
<p>sin' for the doctor? Wae's me ! An she was to dee!"
</p>
<p>And the old aunt fairly wrung her hands with grief.
</p>
<p>Stanley bore Pearl to her room and, laying her
</p>
<p>gently, as if she had been 8 babe, upon her pillows,
</p>
<p>he said to Cecile:
</p>
<p>" I will go for the Doctor; though I think it is only
</p>
<p>a faint from exhaustion. No one knows better than I
</p>
<p>what this poor girl has gone through with in these long
</p>
<p>sleepless weeks of constant nursing and anxious watch-
</p>

<p>broken an ordinary girl into strings. But Pearl is

<p>head. I wonder how long she has been in this dead
</p>
<p>faint, sitting bolt upright? Horrible! Thank God
</p>
<p>we are here, in spite of all the obstacles thrown in our
</p>
<p>way. Now, Cecile, do not look so frightened. Pearl
</p>
<p>will come out better for this enforced rest. I dreaded
</p>
<p>so the shock her father's death would give her! She
</p>
<p>will return to consciousness and calm, you see!'
</p>
<p>and Stanley after building the fires, went out of the
</p>
<p>street door.
</p>
<p>The physician employed by Pearl for her father
</p>
<p>lived near and was in a few minutes at the girl's bed-
</p>
<p>side. Pearl had come to her senses and it was even
</p>
<p>as Stanley had predicted. She was calm and rallied
</p>
<p>rapidly under the new regime of cordials and dainties,
</p>
<p>Stanley had brought with him, anticipating the ripe
</p>
<p>needs of their most grateful services.
</p>
<p>Stanley Veen was a born genius. His head was so
</p>
<p>well balanced by his heart, that he never erred in an-
</p>
<p>swering the accord of their dictations.
</p>
<p>In the delicate situation in which he was now placed
</p>
<p>at the LaGrange cottage the moral strength of his
</p>
<p>character shone out. He assumed every responsibil-
</p>
<p>ity, took charge of every detail connected with the
</p>
<p>funeral and burial of Robert LaGrange conducting
</p>
<p>the entire affair with a judgment, dignity and decorum
</p>
<p>which would have done honor to a man of twice his

<p>years. Happily for Pearl, her lapse from conscious-
</p>
<p>92 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>ness, at the moment of her father's death, left a long
</p>
<p>blank in which her imagination included all the steps
</p>
<p>of anguish leading from the winding sheet to the
</p>
<p>.newly made grave in Tanglewood. So it was wisely
</p>
<p>decided by Stanley that Pearl should, under the in-
</p>
<p>structions of her physician, keep her room for a few
</p>
<p>days.
</p>
<p>The procession which honored the remains of Rob-
</p>
<p>ert LaGrange, included the hearse, and one carriage
</p>
<p>in which were the the minister, sister Meg, Cecile and
</p>
<p>Stanley Veen; and the dead man was as tenderly laid
</p>
<p>to his rest as though the representatives of pride and
</p>
<p>pomp had honored and followed him, with miles of
</p>
<p>shining carriages.

<p>in a miserable hovel on Clay street.
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 93
</p>
<p>At his bedside, in garments of wealth, knelt the
</p>
<p>good wife of Roland Clifford, the charity angel of St.
</p>
<p>Saul, a lady perhaps fifty years of age. She looked
</p>
<p>much younger and had been very beautiful.
</p>
<p>In her rounds among the poor, huddled together
</p>
<p>like so many rats in their uncanny holes, she had
</p>
<p>found John Durant and taken up his pitiable case
</p>
<p>just where the good LaGrange had been compelled to
</p>
<p>leave it; and now, in his last moments she was stimu-
</p>
<p>lating his faith with the wonderful story of the thief
</p>
<p>on the cross. The man seemed suffering from some
</p>
<p>terrible mental depression the infliction of burdened
</p>
<p>conscience.
</p>
<p>Suddenly wandering off in delirium, his exclamations
</p>
<p>startled her. She listened closely, rose to her feet,
</p>
<p>leaned her face closer to his lips to catch the whis-
</p>
<p>pered words; on he rambled, now raving, now whis-
</p>
<p>pering, and much was lost. The woman looked around
</p>
<p>her, placed her hand upon her heart as if to still its
</p>
<p>clamorous beatings; bent again, catching the words
</p>
<p>"Alfred Clifford a felon's cell innocent man!"
</p>
<p>She turned deadly pale and staggered towards the bed
</p>
<p>for support. The man raved on. She went to him,
</p>
<p>seized him by the shoulders, shaking him most harshly;
</p>
<p>" tell me man," said she, " tell me do you know Alfred

</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>of Jesus tell me! I am his mother! Tell me again,
</p>
<p>Oh tell me! You know him to be innocent?"
</p>
<p>He answered quickly back: "Who says I knew
</p>
<p>him? Ha! It is true! I saw" him handcuffed; led
</p>
<p>away between two British officers. His face was white
</p>
<p>and rosy as a girl's; and he scarce over twenty. Oh
</p>
<p>mercy, mercy! How I lothed his fiendish wife! The
</p>
<p>widow who entrapped him into marriage; and Oh
</p>
<p>God! who fastened on his pure untarnished name
</p>
<p>the brand of murderer! Will God forgive the part I
</p>
<p>played in this most awful crime!"
</p>
<p>"What part? Oh tell me man! I shall go mad! "
</p>
<p>and the lady seized the dying wretch with both hands,
</p>
<p>raised him from his cot and tried to fix his gaze and
</p>
<p>force his wandering reason back. It was too late.
</p>
<p>His eyes were glazing. His voice grown husky, and
</p>
<p>his words inarticulate.
</p>
<p>The lady was now beside herself. What could she
</p>
<p>do to stay the hand of death and bring this man to
</p>
<p>full confession? Surely this was the secret she well
</p>
<p>knew existed in some human breast, the secret of her
</p>
<p>son's innocence.
</p>
<p>A woman in rags, untidy in the extreme, and with
</p>
<p>dishevelled hair, entered the room and called out in
</p>
<p>hoarse tones:

</p>
<p>" The doctor is here Ma'm; shall I sind him oop? "
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 95
</p>
<p>" Quickly! Yes," said the lady, still hovering over
</p>
<p>the dying wretch as though the words of life hung on
</p>
<p>his lips.
</p>
<p>The physician, a cheerful looking gentleman wear-
</p>
<p>ing the professional broadcloth, entered, greeting
</p>
<p>Mrs. Clifford cordially and thanking her for sending
</p>
<p>her carriage.
</p>
<p>" I thought the man might perhaps be saved for
</p>
<p>future* usefulness. He has had a remarkable con-
</p>
<p>version," said Mrs. Clifford.
</p>
<p>The doctor took his temperature and pulse, the man
</p>
<p>remaining very still the while. Shaking his head he
</p>
<p>said:
</p>
<p>" I will leave this powder. If he sleeps do not dis-
</p>
<p>turb him; it will do no good His time is up. I have
</p>
<p>a very important case for consultation and must leave
</p>
<p>you to see this patient comfortably over the river. I
</p>
<p>do not think, Madame, a poor soul in the circle of our
</p>
<p>parish work has suffered from cold or starvation this
</p>
<p>winter, and I can safely add, they never will while
</p>
<p>Roland Clifford's wife is spared. Good morning."
</p>
<p>Again alone, the lady bathed the temples of Durant
</p>
<p>with spirits and tried to rouse him, calling to him
</p>
<p>gently. His eyes opened; he muttered, "I've made
</p>
<p>my peace with God; so let me go."

</p>
<p>you know of Alfred Clifford." And the lady forced
</p>
<p>a powder through the lips of the dying man.
</p>
<p>" I know no more," he said, " LaGrange Robert
</p>
<p>LaGrange knows all."
</p>
<p>"Who is LaGrange, and where does he live?"
</p>
<p>wildly inquired the lady.
</p>
<p>" His home is not much better than a dog's kennel;
</p>
<p>but he is good. He lives here in St. Saul."
</p>
<p>The last words were rather gasped than spoken, and
</p>
<p>the man fell back a corpse.
</p>
<p>The lady opened her purse, took out a roll of bills,
</p>
<p>and upon a blank card wrote, repeating to herself, the
</p>
<p>name " Robert LaGrange, St. Saul."
</p>
<p>At this juncture the mistress of the hovel appeared
</p>
<p>and Mrs. Clifford, dreading the detention of a blarney
</p>
<p>over the dead man, thrust a roll of bank bills into her
</p>
<p>dirty fingers, gave her some instructions, hastily threw
</p>
<p>on her wraps, drove to the nearest drug store, con-
</p>
<p>sulted the directory, and disappeared in her carriage
</p>
<p>down the crowded avenue.
</p>
<p>The miseries of human life afford one of the high-
</p>
<p>est proofs of a future state, since it cannot be imag-
</p>
<p>ined how infinite benevolence could create a being
</p>
<p>capable of enjoying so much more than is here to be

<p>enjoyed, and qualified by nature to prolong pain by

<p>remembrance and anticipate it by terror, if he was

<p>state in which many of his faculties serve only for

<p>his torment. There must surely come a time when

<p>every capacity for happiness shall be filled, and none

<p>shall be wretched, save by his own fault.
</p>
<p>If our present state were one continued succession

</p>
<p>we should never willingly reflect upon its end. Afflic-

<p>tion prepares us for felicity, and we may confidently

</p>
<p>it cannot be a particular mark of divine displeasure,
</p>
<p>since all the distresses of . persecution have been suf-
</p>
<p>fered by those "of whom the world was not worthy,"
</p>
<p>and the redeemer of mankind, himself, was a man of
</p>
<p>sorrows, and acquainted with grief.

<p>The Queen's bench which sits four times a year at

<p>led a long life of shame and iniquity. I am about
</p>
<p>to die. Robert LaGrange, well known among the
</p>
<p>poor of St. Saul as a man of small means and large
</p>
<p>charities, has provided a comfortable place for me to
</p>
<p>die in, and visited and prayed with me from his own
</p>
<p>sick bed. I am sincerely repenting of my sins and
</p>
<p>trusting to the mercy of heaven. In testimonial
</p>
<p>whereof I make full confession of the only wrong I
</p>
<p>am able to repair in the short space of time now al-
</p>
<p>lotted me. Sixteen years ago in the City of Quebec
</p>
<p>in Her Majesty's dominion, I was employed as porter
</p>
<p>for several months in the Frankfort Hotel. A young
</p>
<p>married couple were boarding at this hotel by the
</p>
<p>name of Clifford. The husband, Alfred Clifford, was
</p>
<p>an industrious, courteous gentleman, and a most pop-
</p>
<p>ular man socially and among business men. He was
</p>
<p>a traveling salesman for a large house in New York
</p>
<p>and his headquarters had been established a little less

<p>than a year at Quebec.
</p>
<p>100 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Clifford was very unpopular at the hotel, hav-
</p>
<p>ing shown a violent temper, and upon one occasion
</p>
<p>seriously injured a bell boy by throwing a toilet
</p>
<p>bottle at his head for having innocently delivered one
</p>
<p>of her letters to her husband. After this no one
</p>
<p>cared to wait upon her but myself, and I was drawn
</p>
<p>to her presumably as evil-disposed people are usually
</p>
<p>attracted toward each other.
</p>
<p>One morning when passing her door she called me
</p>
<p>into her room and asked me if I would help a lady in
</p>
<p>a strait for good pay. I replied that I was her man
</p>
<p>and eternal secrecy should be my motto. She then
</p>
<p>related to me a long list of serious domestic troubles
</p>
<p>between herself and Mr. Clifford; how she had clan-
</p>
<p>destinely become aware of his devotions to another,
</p>
<p>her plans for thwarting him in the same, and finally
</p>
<p>she revealed the demoniacal scheme at heart for his
</p>
<p>utter ruin, and her coveted and complete revenge.
</p>
<p>It was understood at the hotel that the relations
</p>
<p>between Mr. and Mrs. Clifford were most unhappy,
</p>
<p>and he Clifford, had been advised to obtain a
</p>
<p>divorce. This she anticipated, but she knew no steps
</p>
<p>would be taken before a domestic event transpired,
</p>
<p>then imminent. She therefore resorted to a most
</p>
<p>desperate expedient, and one I sincerely regretted my
</p>
<p>own complicity with, when I realized the magnitude

</p>
<p>of the crime involved.
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 101
</p>
<p>Everything was arranged awaiting the return of
</p>
<p>Clifford to Quebec. The third night after his arrival
</p>
<p>I assisted Mrs. Clifford in disappearing mysteriously,
</p>
<p>leaving Mr. Clifford under the effects of a strong nar-
</p>
<p>cotic with his clothes blood-stained and a bloody knife
</p>
<p>concealed upon his person. Our plans were so in-
</p>
<p>geniously carried out that no clue whatever could be
</p>
<p>obtained in clearing up the mystery. I had left the
</p>
<p>Frankfort two weeks before, and was not even ques-
</p>
<p>tioned upon the arrest of young Clifford. It was as
</p>
<p>thoroughly a mystery as though the woman had evap-
</p>
<p>orated, save the unmistakable evidences of crime
</p>
<p>which were thrust upon the innocent man when his
</p>
<p>room was broken into late the following day, and he
</p>
<p>aroused from an apparent drunken stupor,and marched
</p>
<p>off to a felon's cell without even a hearing. I have
</p>
<p>understood since, he had influential friends in the
</p>
<p>United States who tried to liberate him, but it was
</p>
<p>impossible while the impenetrable mystery of his
</p>
<p>wife's disappearance remained unsolved.
</p>
<p>I could die happy if I knew this innocent man had
</p>
<p>been delivered, or that he lived to be benefitted by
</p>
<p>this confession.
</p>
<p>The last I knew of Mrs. Clifford she was convales-
</p>
<p>cent at the lying-in hospital of St. Elizabeth, at Strat-
</p>
<p>ford. If Clifford yet lives, he languishes in the old
</p>
<p>Canadian prison at Quebec.

<p>102 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>The April sun looked down upon the walls of the
</p>
<p>city of Quebec the Gibralter of America flashing
</p>
<p>over its metallic roofs and dancing over the waves of
</p>
<p>the St. Lawrence and St. Charles twin rivers, con-
</p>
<p>fluent at its base as unconscious of the crimes and
</p>
<p>miseries which hid themselves like so many lizards in
</p>
<p>a wall under its magnificent edifices, as the playful
</p>
<p>freaks of a summer's wind are innocent of the mad
</p>
<p>sweep of the ruthless cyclone.
</p>
<p>The officer in charge of the Si Vincent de Paul
</p>
<p>prison created a profound sensation among the pris-
</p>
<p>oners on the morning in question, by speaking in a
</p>
<p>peculiarly distinct and significant manner the follow-
</p>
<p>ing words: " Prisoner Alfred Clifford! You are ordered
</p>
<p>to report at once to the Commissioner's office upon
</p>
<p>matters which pertain to your restoration to liberty."
</p>
<p>There was a stir among a company of men sitting
</p>
<p>engaged in various occupations around a long table in
</p>
<p>a narrow room looking out upon an iron balcony.
</p>
<p>The men were none of them in prison attire, nor
</p>
<p>did their movements and freedom of social intercourse
</p>
<p>with each other, indicate they were controlled by any
</p>
<p>restrictions whatever. As the announcement was
</p>
<p>made, a tall, pale, youthful looking man rose to his
</p>
<p>feet, bowed and smiled a respectful acquiescence.

</p>
<p>delicate manipulations, " Clifford, I congratulate you!

<p>St. Vincent never had any legitimate business with

<p>you anyhow. Why man! What is the matter?
</p>
<p>You tremble as though you had received the sentence
</p>
<p>to hang by the neck till dead, when it is liberty, sweet
</p>
<p>liberty, that calls you to her arms! You ought to be
</p>
<p>the happiest man in Canada!"
</p>
<p>" Comrade," said Clifford in a low tone of voice,
</p>
<p>"imagine an eagle who had once prided himself
</p>
<p>upon soaring into the face of the sun, suddenly cap-
</p>
<p>tured and pinioned down by both wings in the depths

</p>
<p>in duress for sixteen years ! Then imagine the effect

<p>I shall begin with a synopsis of prison reforms. Here's
</p>
<p>104 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>my last unfinished work, which, if restored to liberty,
</p>
<p>I enjoin upon you to complete. It may be the means
</p>
<p>of ameliorating the condition of things, or it may do
</p>
<p>more."
</p>
<p>Here a messenger came saying: "Perhaps Alfred
</p>
<p>Clifford prefers serving out the full term of his sen-
</p>
<p>tence; the friend who is waiting to see him is growing
</p>
<p>impatient."
</p>
<p>"Friend?" said Clifford, "I had forgotten the
</p>
<p>music of that word! It must be some one from the
</p>
<p>States! Well, I give you th;s precious manuscript
</p>
<p>and commend you to the God who has heard my
</p>
<p>prayer. If I had forgotten him he would not have
</p>
<p>remembered me to-day! Farewell to you all."
</p>
<p>The men rose to their feet, showing much emotion
</p>
<p>in bidding him farewell.
</p>
<p>Among the inmates of the penitentiary, Alfred Clif-
</p>
<p>ford was not looked upon as a fellow prisoner; nor
</p>
<p>did he in any sense share the fate of criminals under
</p>
<p>the same sentence. His influence had been deeply
</p>
<p>felt, and his words of kindness and smiles of pity
</p>
<p>were dispensed impartially, sending sunshine into the
</p>
<p>sepulchral gloom of the felon's cell. It is no marvel
</p>
<p>then, that the news of his liberation was received with
</p>
<p>strong expressions of gladness for him and sorrow for
</p>
<p>themselves. Throughout the cellular recesses of the

<p>prison, the words "Clifford is free !" electrified the

<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 105
</p>
<p>miserable inmates, who fell back shudderingly upon
</p>
<p>their iron beds with a renewed sense of their hor-
</p>
<p>rible abode.
</p>
<p>When received at St. Vincent, Alfred Clifford, a
</p>
<p>mere boy in years, could neither comprehend the
</p>
<p>crime ascribed to him, nor the sentence attaching
</p>
<p>thereto. His very presence carried with it the pure
</p>
<p>atmosphere of his innocence, and at once enlisted for
</p>
<p>him the sympathy and respect of his keepers.
</p>
<p>The lack of any positive evidence to convict him,
</p>
<p>together with his unaffected sincerity of manner, and
</p>
<p>his courteous submission to his fate, won for him the
</p>
<p>confidence of the officers, and the freedom of the
</p>
<p>building and grounds.
</p>
<p>His health had naturally suffered impairment from
</p>
<p>the effects of the great mental strain imposed in a
</p>
<p>continual consciousness of the cloud hanging over him,
</p>
<p>and his natural buoyancy of spirits had lapsed into a
</p>
<p>state of dejected melancholy.
</p>
<p>Hence he evinced little enthusiasm in responding
</p>
<p>to the officer's message, though it brought him the
</p>
<p>first intimation of liberty and a return to the world he
</p>
<p>had received, since his incarceration a little more
</p>
<p>than sixteen years ago.
</p>
<p>As hope had long since died out in his heart, his
</p>
<p>step had lost its elasticity, and he passed through the

<p>chanical effort being the only visible sign of emotion.
</p>
<p>His rap at the officer's door was quickly answered by
</p>
<p>the peremptory words " come in," and now he had
</p>
<p>paced the whole length of the apartment to the com-
</p>
<p>missioner's desk without observing the unusual pres-
</p>
<p>ence of a lady, closely veiled, or bethinking himself
</p>
<p>of the " friend " announced as awaiting him.
</p>
<p>The entire corps of prison officials surrounded the
</p>
<p>desk, and the important documentary evidence of his
</p>
<p>innocence, together with his liberty papers, were pre-
</p>
<p>sented him for his perusal and signature, after which,
</p>
<p>turning to the lady who had not recognized her son in
</p>
<p>the entrance of the prisoner, the commissioner said:
</p>
<p>"Madame, I have the honor of restoring to you
</p>
<p>your son He was prepared to say much more but
</p>
<p>was overcome by the scene his words had produced.
</p>
<p>Throwing her veil aside with an expression of in-
</p>
<p>effable tenderness shining through her tears, as the
</p>
<p>sun may glance through falling dn drops, Mrs. Clif-
</p>
<p>ford opened her arms to receive her martyred son.
</p>
<p>" My mother! " said Alfred Clifford, as his head fell
</p>
<p>upon her breast.
</p>
<p>" My son! " said his mother, and they were locked in
</p>
<p>that embrace of pure love, which plants its deathless
</p>
<p>image in the human soul from the first hour of exist-
</p>
<p>ence, and which death itself can never efface.

</p>
<p>the happy mother could bear her son away triumph-
</p>
<p>antly from the gloomy walls of St. Vincent de Paul,
</p>
<p>to her home in the States. " The world was all before
</p>
<p>him where to choose." Yet the noble-hearted Clif-
</p>
<p>ford could not turn his back with cold indifference
</p>
<p>upon the human associations of nearly half a lifetime.
</p>
<p>He felt great compassion for those who were to re-
</p>
<p>main behind, who had neither the self-consciousness
</p>
<p>of innocence to support the hope of a restoration of
</p>
<p>their liberties to them here, nor encouragements to
</p>
<p>see beyond the rewards of this world the opportuni-
</p>
<p>ties and possibilities of a life to come whose hearts

<p>lay smouldering in the wreck and ashes of a ruin both
</p>
<p>absolute and irredeemable.

<p>" Sweet are the uses of adversity! " Forgetful of
</p>
<p>himself, and of the unknown future opening at his
</p>
<p>feet, Clifford occupied the day in his leave-taking of
</p>
<p>the wretched beings entombed for life in this colossal
</p>
<p>confine, nor could ho see the invisible ministering
</p>
<p>spirits who leaned above him and hinted comfort to
</p>
<p>his heart, and caressed him as they ever do those who
</p>
<p>have done much through great tribulation for their
</p>
<p>fellow beings.
</p>
<p>He saw them not; but he heard within his soul the
</p>
<p>soft, sweet prelude of immortal harmonies and knew
</p>
<p>not whence it came.

<p>CHAPTER VIII.
</p>
<p>As dying embers mount on tongues of flame,
</p>
<p>When by the faintest breath of ether blown;
</p>
<p>So feeds the jealous heart upon a name
</p>
<p>A simple name where nothing more is known.
</p>
<p>Human love has a variety of manifestations accord-
</p>
<p>ing to the elevation of its object, the quality of its as-
</p>
<p>pirations and the capacities of its subjects for indul-
</p>
<p>gence in this divine passion of the soul.
</p>
<p>Jealousy has been called the hypochrondria of love.
</p>
<p>Having a thousand eyes, each of them quick to see a
</p>
<p>great deal more than there is to be seen, it never stops
</p>
<p>to inquire into any of those little particulars which in
</p>
<p>reality make all the difference " 'twixt tweedle dee and
</p>
<p>tweedle dum;" but having as many phases as there are
</p>
<p>shades of green, it follows the blind lead of its suspi-
</p>
<p>cious fears and the crooked paths of its disordered
</p>
<p>imagination and evil impulses.

</p>
<p>righteous indignation, such as a loyal and devoted
</p>
<p>wife might naturally indulge upon the discovery of
</p>
<p>her husband's inexcusable infidelities a crime dif-
</p>
<p>ficult to condone if conducted within a halo of deceit-
</p>
<p>ful attentions and apparent exclusiveness of affection
</p>
<p>for the party wronged.
</p>
<p>Distinct, yet scarcely less criminal than these radi-
</p>
<p>cal deviations from virtue and right, are the adulter-
</p>
<p>ies of the heart; those mean and contemptible society
</p>
<p>vices, those lapses from manly dignity and womanly
</p>
<p>purity, which permit an endless variety of idle dalli-
</p>
<p>ances around the " ragged edges" of crime, examples
</p>
<p>pernicious and deadly to the young and inexperienced,
</p>
<p>and the most prolific sources of evil and crime in the
</p>
<p>world.
</p>
<p>The Almighty Father has said: " I will have no other
</p>
<p>God before me ; for I, the Lord, thy God, am a jeal-
</p>
<p>ous God;" and the true wife, she who is fitted to re-
</p>
<p>spond to man's utmost needs as companion and help-
</p>
<p>meet, may echo this sentiment regarding her husband's
</p>
<p>domestic fealty without offensiveness or blasphemy.
</p>
<p>In contradistinction to this, however, is it not pitiful,
</p>
<p>when plenty of crime exists outside the realms of
</p>
<p>fancy, that the foul bird jealousy is capable of lay-
</p>
<p>ing and hatching her uncanny broods in the lofty
</p>
<p>chambers of the immortal imagination?

<p>The jealousy manifested by Hector Kellogg had no
</p>
<p>110 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>foundation whatever in the reality of things. It was
</p>
<p>the grotesque and fantastic conjuring of an imagina-
</p>
<p>tion exercised only upon devising mischief and wicked-
</p>
<p>ness.
</p>
<p>Since the discovery of the innocent card upon the
</p>
<p>library floor, Hector Kellogg had either shadowed per-
</p>
<p>sonally, or bribed the stableboy to dog the every foot-
</p>
<p>step of her husband. Wherever the Governor re-
</p>
<p>paired within the limits of St. Saul he found his car-
</p>
<p>riage always within call. His mind was deeply oc-
</p>
<p>cupied with the affairs of state, with library labor,
</p>
<p>and a multiplicity of cares; and close as was the
</p>
<p>watch maintained over his movements day and night,
</p>
<p>he had not observed anything peculiar or extraordi-
</p>
<p>nary in it.
</p>
<p>This was particularly rasping to Lady Kellogg, who
</p>
<p>eagerly longed for a complaint from the Governor on
</p>
<p>this source that she might confront him with her
</p>
<p>fresh testimonials of his infidelity. Had he mis-
</p>
<p>trusted half the accumulated " documentary evidence"
</p>
<p>secretly stored up against him, or the multitude of
</p>
<p>little traps set in his path, he would gladly have faced
</p>
<p>and bearded this lioness and all her snooping frater-
</p>
<p>nals in their several dens. He had nothing to hide,
</p>
<p>and could have answered his slanderous accusers, as
</p>
<p>did the great Napoleon, the base accusations of his

<p>court: that he had "no time for dissipations."
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. Ill
</p>
<p>With every human apology a man could desire to
</p>
<p>cloak sin in, Governor Kellogg had that nobility of
</p>
<p>soul, that purity of heart, which no persuasive power
</p>
<p>on earth could divert, no favoring circumstances turn
</p>
<p>into paths of shame. He had no comprehension of
</p>
<p>those guilty pleasures which are compelled to skulk
</p>
<p>around the -world to find a hiding plage "Tiltonian
</p>
<p>sins" which men and women have tried to dress up
</p>
<p>in white garments and make respectable word pict-
</p>
<p>ures of, but which are invariably recognized from
</p>
<p>their mustela putorious odor, and hunted back to their
</p>
<p>holes.
</p>
<p>So much a pandemonium had his home become to
</p>
<p>him, that Governor Kellogg was rarely to be found
</p>
<p>within its walls, save when locked in his library. He
</p>
<p>snatched his meals alone, and most of his nights were
</p>
<p>spent in the executive chamber. This baffled and
</p>
<p>infuriated his wife beyond all bounds, arousing a horde
</p>
<p>of suspicions yet blacker in criminalmagnitude. She
</p>
<p>literally foamed with rage when she heard his ap-
</p>
<p>proaching footsteps, and believing the extreme mo-
</p>

<p>complete disruption of the marital tie.
</p>
<p>Discreet men and women with real causes for sep-
</p>
<p>aration, have remained nominally united through life,
</p>
<p>suffering in silence and alone, and without sympathy.
</p>
<p>With children it would seem an imperative neces-

<p>sity; without them, the dignified attitude of self res-

<p>pect and personal decency may require the sacrifice.
</p>
<p>When poisonous reptiles have been wounded and

<p>to recoil upon themselves, fastening their deadly fangs

<p>if the cruel slanderers could thus perish before prop-

<p>It had been over a week since Hector Kellogg had
</p>
<p>seen the Governor. He had been called out of the
</p>
<p>city on official business, and she knew not the hour of
</p>
<p>his return. Of late the library door had been kept
</p>
<p>locked, and anything unusual, however trivial, which
</p>
<p>raises the mercury of a woman's curiosity to boiling
</p>
<p>point, is a dangerous expedient, and one sure to bring
</p>
<p>its projector to grief, if practiced in the domestic thea-

<p>*made from a wax impression she had taken of the
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 113
</p>
<p>keyhole, and was now prepared to explore the myster-
</p>
<p>ies of the Governor's sanctum.
</p>
<p>Telling her servants she would be out for the day,
</p>
<p>and taking all necessary precautions, as she thought,
</p>
<p>to secure herself against surprises, she entered the
</p>
<p>library through the drawing room door.
</p>
<p>"At last!" said she to herself. "The precious se-
</p>
<p>crets he thought so cunningly to bar from me,. are
</p>
<p>compelled to divulge themselves," and breathing out
</p>
<p>defiance and scorn in a mocking laugh, which had
</p>
<p>neither a mirthful or human tone to it, she passed
</p>
<p>through the door, secured it from the inside and com-
</p>
<p>menced her search.
</p>
<p>From floor to ceiling she ransacked with the method
</p>
<p>of fanatical madness. Books were overhauled, statuettes
</p>
<p>removed from their pedestals, and every dark nook
</p>
<p>exposed to the strong morning light in the careful
</p>
<p>search instituted.
</p>
<p>Unremittingly the work continued till morning
</p>
<p>waned to noon, and until the sun flamed directly
</p>
<p>through the western windows, lighting up the massive
</p>
<p>cases of brilliantly bound volumes which lined the
</p>
<p>four walls of this sumptuous apartment, gilding stat-
</p>
<p>uary and pictures and throwing the superb head of
</p>
<p>Madame Roland in a halo of sunset glories. Still the
</p>
<p>work continued with indefatigable zeal. The elegant

</p>
<p>pied the alcove spaces of the bow window were most
</p>
<p>minutely inspected ; yet after all this laborious search,
</p>
<p>thorough as it was, the lady looked haggard with dis-
</p>
<p>appointment. She actually had nothing to repay her
</p>
<p>critical explorations; and pale with the day's excite-
</p>
<p>ment and fast, she stood defeated and irresolute.
</p>
<p>" Must she give up the coveted secrets she believed
</p>
<p>within reach, yet eluding her as if consciously on guard
</p>
<p>and determined to keep inviolate the trust reposed in
</p>
<p>them?"
</p>
<p>Recalling vision and thought from their vacuities,
</p>
<p>and rousing herself to a last inventory glance over the
</p>
<p>entire field of her researches, suddenly, and as if by
</p>
<p>demoniac inspiration, her eyes fell upon a faintly out-
</p>
<p>lined seam across the base of the Governor's private
</p>
<p>escritoire, and a gleam of satisfaction darted over her
</p>
<p>. scowling visage, fierce as the play of lightning over
</p>
<p>the dark brow of a storm cloud. It was the moment
</p>
<p>of triumph when she discovered a secret spring be-
</p>
<p>neath. Only a slight pressure and the sensitive
</p>
<p>mechanism responded, pushing out a deep drawer,
</p>
<p>orderly stored with papers. These she quickly un-
</p>
<p>packed and examined, under the rear files of which,
</p>
<p>carefully protected, lay a bright plush casket.
</p>
<p>" Ah-ha! " said she, scarcely believing her eyes, and

<p>seizing it with the avidity with which a hungry mastiff
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 115
</p>
<p>seizes upon a well fleshed bone. " This looks as though
</p>
<p>it had a history."
</p>
<p>The casket was locked but the gold key attached
</p>
<p>to the handle soon revealed its hidden treasures,
</p>
<p>at sight of which Hector Kellogg' s idolatrous vision
</p>
<p>fairly danced in delicious delirium, and something of
</p>
<p>the expression of the Hindoo worshipper in the pre-
</p>
<p>sence of his golden images lent a transient gleam of
</p>
<p>softness to her hard set features.
</p>
<p>" After all," said she, " I may have undervalued the
</p>
<p>hold I have upon this man an.d his attachment to me.
</p>
<p>These jewels I believe he has purchased for my birth-
</p>
<p>day, for who else could wear such gorgeous sparklers
</p>
<p>in St. Saul, and he knows I love them. " And there was
</p>
<p>a general settling of the lines, and a purring expres-
</p>
<p>sion lent to the thin compressed lips.
</p>
<p>" I will replace them now that I know of their ex-
</p>
<p>istence. If they disappear mysteriously, Hector Kel-
</p>
<p>logg will demand both explanation and redress. " So
</p>
<p>saying, she returned the casket as she found it, pre-
</p>
<p>pared to trust the kind suspicions so newly kindled in
</p>
<p>her breast, when another thought flashed over her.
</p>
<p>" I cannot swear to these unless I put a private mark
</p>
<p>upon them," and the jewels were again dragged to the
</p>
<p>light and a peculiar and distinct mark made upon the
</p>
<p>back of their richly wrought setting. Before replacing

</p>
<p>bed for the first time since it was packed in Canada.
</p>
<p>"What was it beneath which made Hector Kellogg turn
</p>
<p>ashy pale dropping box and jewels upon the floor,
</p>
<p>and recoiling as though she had suddenly thrust her
</p>
<p>hands into a bed of live coals?
</p>
<p>In the box below the tray, upon an oriental parch-
</p>
<p>ment, in illuminative lettering was the despised name
</p>
<p>of "Pearl LaGrange! "
</p>
<p>" So this wealthy gift is for that low-born hussy, is
</p>
<p>it?" and the woman looked as though reinforced by a
</p>
<p>fresh army of plotting demons.
</p>
<p>" I will trample her, and these, under my feet into
</p>
<p>a thousand atoms first! " and she moved as though
</p>
<p>about to execute one part of the threat, when she heard
</p>
<p>the front door close, and knew none but her husband
</p>
<p>could enter unannounced.
</p>
<p>Her blood fairly curdled in her veins to think of
</p>
<p>his finding her here ! a discovery which must lead to
</p>
<p>the utter overthrow of all future plans for tracking
</p>
<p>him out; and, hastily securing and concealing the
</p>
<p>jewels about her person and thrusting the papers back
</p>
<p>in mad confusion in the drawer, she closed it by its
</p>
<p>secret spring.
</p>
<p>At this juncture the folding doors of the drawing-
</p>
<p>room slid back and the quick nervous step of the Gov-

<p>ernor approached the library door.
</p>
<p>. A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 117
</p>
<p>" Great God! " she exclaimed in an audible whisper,
</p>
<p>"what shall I do?"
</p>
<p>To escape unnoticed seemed impossible; and the
</p>
<p>jewels inspired and rather courted a personal en-
</p>
<p>counter, much as she deplored the necessity of being
</p>
<p>discovered in this sacred sanctum of her husband.
</p>
<p>As the door opened lady Kellogg concealed herself
</p>
<p>behind it, ingeniously meaning to slip out unobserved
</p>
<p>if the Governor should leave it thrown back and move
</p>
<p>as was his habit with his back toward it directly to
</p>
<p>his writing table and tHe bow-window opposite.
</p>
<p>This time his movements were eccentric ; he turned
</p>
<p>to close the door and started shudderingly upn con-
</p>
<p>fronting his wife, whose face was horribly distorted
</p>
<p>with passion, and who turned upon him with the eyes
</p>
<p>of a tigress and from whom he involuntarily recoiled,
</p>
<p>so shocked was he upon discovering her presence and
</p>
<p>formidable attitude.
</p>
<p>"Why Hector Astore!" (the Astore was the
</p>
<p>cherished title of her widowhood and was emphasized
</p>
<p>by the Governor in a conciliatory way) "how came
</p>
<p>you here and what new devil's scheme have you been
</p>
<p>concocting in my absence? Did I lock you in by mis-
</p>
<p>take when I went out the other night, or have you
</p>
<p>forcibly entered and through what aperture? The

<p>private apartment for its owner," and with a sigh of
</p>
<p>118 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>weariness, Governor Kellogg wheeled his chair up to
</p>
<p>his writing table and gazed thoughtfully through the
</p>
<p>clear glass pane, out upon the restful green of a
</p>
<p>freshly mown lawn, whose verdure had a peculiar
</p>
<p>tender loveliness only known to spring.
</p>
<p>Still his wife stood sullenly surveying him and act-
</p>
<p>ually speechless with rage. He was sure he was
</p>
<p>poising upon the edges of a volcano which any moment
</p>
<p>might burst forth, scattering the hot lava of its pent
</p>
<p>up furies; and he was endeavoring to be as calm and
</p>
<p>imperturbed as possible, hopin*g thereby to withdraw
</p>
<p>the charge noislessly and before the percussion cap
</p>
<p>exploded.
</p>
<p>" How much will you ask me to vacate? " said the
</p>
<p>Governor. " I have writing which will occupy every
</p>
<p>moment from this time on to midnight, and you will
</p>
<p>oblige me by closing the door from the outside."
</p>
<p>" It is a free country and I propose to stand here
</p>
<p>until I know why the drunkard LaGrange's daughter
</p>
<p>is permitted to flaunt her name all over my house, and
</p>
<p>how much the State appropriates in 'hush money ' to
</p>
<p>its Governor for the support of such wanton creature s
</p>
<p>that they may be kept in finery and jewels? "
</p>
<p>The Governor answered with peals of laughter.
</p>
<p>" Surely this must be some huge joke perpetrated
</p>
<p>upon the idiotic credulity of this insanely jealous

<p>woman! " thought he.
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 119
</p>
<p>" Pray, who is LaGrange's daughter? I never heard
</p>
<p>of the name before. She mast be some new bird you
</p>
<p>preying vultures have discovered soaring above you,
</p>
<p>and which your fowling pieces foul as their charges
</p>
<p>are have failed to bring down. LaGrange? The
</p>
<p>name dawns upon me vaguely. However, I never knew
</p>
<p>a woman by this name. Tell me ; is she young and
</p>
<p>pretty; or of what kindred crime is she accused? By
</p>
<p>all the saints, if she is fair in face, her character is
</p>
<p>foul; and if she's young, well formed, and fresh as
</p>
<p>rose-blooms culled in June, her name is blacker than an
</p>
<p>Ethiope's skin, and the graces of her soul are hag-
</p>
<p>gled into atoms, rolled in the mire of green eyed envy,
</p>
<p>and foot-balled through the streets (unless wealth
</p>
<p>stand on guard, brandishing her golden club.)" And
</p>
<p>the Governor lighted his cigar, elevated his feet and
</p>
<p>proceeded to brace himself against the next poser.
</p>
<p>" It is all very well for you to plead innocence con-
</p>
<p>cerning this new protege of yours. I am not the only
</p>
<p>one aware of your clandestine interviews," and the
</p>
<p>thin lips almost disappeared as the jaws closed upon
</p>
<p>this biting sarcasm.
</p>
<p>The Governor's good nature triumphed again, as he
</p>
<p>replied in the rhetoric of Paul :
</p>
<p>" There was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the
</p>
<p>messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be ex-

</p>
<p>alted above measure."
</p>
<p>120 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>Resolved to introduce the jewels, Hector Kellogg
</p>
<p>continued: " The Tongueworts give a reception to
</p>
<p>General Evans' son a few evenings hence; the Gover-
</p>
<p>nor's wife requires a new set of jewelry for the occa-
</p>
<p>sion. How much will the good state appropriate for
</p>
<p>this respectable claim?"
</p>
<p>A rap on the library door, and a card announcing
</p>
<p>" Louis Carlisle, M. D.," interrupted the interview.
</p>
<p>" Show the gentleman in, Mary," said the Gover-
</p>
<p>nor; and Hector Kellogg was compelled to withdraw
</p>
<p>after having vainly sought some vantage ground from
</p>
<p>which she could hurl a shot which would make a visi-
</p>
<p>ble wound. She had the coveted secret and its proof,
</p>
<p>the jewels. She would keep these till the opportune
</p>
<p>moment for using them as a weapon of moral defence,
</p>
<p>and in the event of any personal emergency which
</p>
<p>might arise. Thus solacing herself, she passed out
</p>
<p>of the door as the new physician of St. Saul entered
</p>
<p>the presence of Governor Kellogg.
</p>
<p>The day was in the gloaming, and although Dr.
</p>
<p>Carlisle and lady Kellogg brushed by each other
</p>
<p>quite forcibly, neither one would have been able to
</p>
<p>recognize the other again from this brusque introduc-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>" I believe I am expected at the Governor's this

<p>Kellogg extended his hand.
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 121
</p>
<p>" You are; and I am glad for an interval of rest from
</p>
<p>the threadmill of official work. Be seated and have a
</p>
<p>Havana," said the prince of hosts, as he proffered
</p>
<p>the doctor his selection from a box of fragrant cigars ;
</p>
<p>while the servant lighted a cluster of gas burners and
</p>
<p>withdrawing, left host and guest in the quiet possess-
</p>
<p>ion of the apartment, which only a moment before
</p>
<p>had given promise of being both heated and illumi-
</p>
<p>nated by an entirely different class of combustibles.
</p>
<p>The two gentlemen then entered into a conversation
</p>
<p>upon a topic just then very near the Governor's heart,
</p>
<p>the declining health of his beloved sister, who was an
</p>
<p>inmate of the insane asylum at St. Saul.
</p>
<p>After an exhaustive professional consultation, the
</p>
<p>conversation lapsed into social themes. Many of the
</p>
<p>most influential families were mentioned, and among
</p>
<p>these, Col. and Mrs. Veen and their talented children
</p>
<p>were enthusiastically discussed.
</p>
<p>"Your remarks," said Dr. Carlisle, "concerning
</p>
<p>young Veen, as being constructed out of the timber
</p>
<p>from which heroes and reformers are made "bold,
</p>
<p>daring, ready to sacrifice himself for a principle or a
</p>
<p>cause, reminds me I have seen our heroine."
</p>

<p>ours must be a sort of ethereal essence; a being too

</p>
<p>cal as to her reality," replied the Governor.
</p>
<p>122 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>" Not at all," quickly responded the doctor, " she is
</p>
<p>the most perfect child of nature I ever met; and her
</p>
<p>history is very touching. Stanley and Cecile Veen
</p>
<p>are devotedly attached to her; and grouping this
</p>
<p>youthful trio, you have three royal studies for an as-
</p>
<p>spiring artist to build a reputation on. I must con-
</p>
<p>fess Pearl LaGrange has a radiating loveliness about
</p>
<p>her, which must eventually throw the most brilliant
</p>
<p>and beautiful women in the shade, but wherein her
</p>
<p>great attraction lies, no one can define. Perhaps
</p>
<p>merely in her being natural and without pretentious;
</p>
<p>claiming neither praise nor applause nor homage from
</p>
<p>anyone. I enthuse over her, since I find it a family
</p>
<p>failing, in which my wife and son more than keep
</p>
<p>pace with me."
</p>
<p>" This is an agreeable state of affairs, certainly,"
</p>
<p>said the Governor, " and quite novel in St. Saul
</p>
<p>could it become epidemic. It is the rarest music to
</p>
<p>hear praises of woman from woman's lips. I've met

<p>ceptions. One is notable, our banker's wife, Mrs.

<p>every blade of grass with diamonds that the foun-

<p>all, is the life of love, if only the world could see it.
</p>
<p>The fact that God serves; that he is the universal
</p>
<p>servant, is the testimony to his perfection. Mrs.

<p>Clifford is very handsome, but no longer young; there-

<p>of her purse alone she holds her own in that idolatrous

<p>follow in the wake of her carriage until I obtained a

<p>" Yet you are not a susceptible young man? " inter-

<p>rupted the Governor playfully.
</p>
<p>" Not at all ! " said Carlisle. " This woman and I
</p>
<p>have, entre nous, a very grave conscience fund to
</p>
<p>adjust. She is really nothing to me, and I am doubt-
</p>
<p>less a forgotten atom in her past history ; yet am I

<p>unwittingly made the Nemesis of her destiny; and

<p>sooner or later, according to the eternal fitness of

<p>whose freedom is unconstitutional, whose breath is

</p>
<p>" There you are again," said the Governor, jocosely,
</p>
<p>" off at the antipodes, while I am left to limp behind
</p>
<p>in the fashion of an unfledged bird in the track of an
</p>
<p>aerial navigator. Now, my dear sir, I have no itching
</p>
<p>ears, no inordinate curiosity regarding the life mys-

<p>neck is out of this official yoke of bondage, and you

<p>nothing more than this lusty race, with the profes-

<p>opened his vest and went down into the depths of a

<p>secret receptacle for something.

<p>minister of truth and equity, consigned it to my keep-
</p>
<p>ing."
</p>
<p>Governor Kellogg rose, holding the portrait under
</p>
<p>the central burner of the chandelier. His countenance
</p>
<p>changed. The locket fell from his hands; his brain
</p>
<p>whirled and he grew deathly sick.
</p>
<p>Doctor Carlisle sprang forward and helped him to
</p>
<p>the sofa, offering him a glass of water.
</p>
<p>" Why, Governor, you are ill ! I fear I've wearied
</p>
<p>you to-night, and that most selfishly. Let's see,
</p>
<p>your pulse lies deep, and that is a good sign for long-
</p>
<p>evity. How is the heart?"
</p>
<p>" Deep and inscrutable as is my pulse," replied the
</p>
<p>Governor, affecting a sangfroid not manifest in his
</p>
<p>blanched face and agitated manner, as he returned the
</p>
<p>half drained goblet to the doctor's hand. "Oh it is
</p>
<p>nothing. I am overworked. One cannot always keep
</p>
<p>up, tensioned as I have been for months," and he rose,
</p>
<p>yet pale and trembling.
</p>
<p>Doctor Carlisle stooped and picked up the medal-
</p>
<p>lion, saying as he did so:
</p>
<p>" This looks like a bad omen for my lady's pros-
</p>
<p>pects in your hands."
</p>
<p>" I beg pardon, doctor, but a soulless face has some-
</p>
<p>thing shocking in its shadow merely."

</p>
<p>Now there are moments with the best disciplined
</p>
<p>hearts, no matter how strong or how good they may
</p>
<p>be by nature, when one wishes, almost, for a handful
</p>
<p>of Jove's thunderbolts, that he might hurl them at
</p>
<p>the world and blot it out of being.
</p>
<p>"I have seen Socrates' Xanthippe, Perdition's
</p>
<p>Queen, and Hell's three Furies. What more have
</p>
<p>you to offer?" said the Governor with a bitterness of
</p>
<p>tone which touched Carlisle most sensitively, and the
</p>
<p>latter consulting his watch, exclaimed:
</p>
<p>" Why, is it possible the night is bordering on to-
</p>
<p>morrow? I owe you a thousand apologies for making
</p>
<p>such a bore of myself; and, unless I can do something
</p>
<p>for you professionally, I will best prove my regard by
</p>
<p>bidding you good-night and commending you to that
</p>
<p>rest your complete exhaustion requires."
</p>
<p>"Come again," said the Governor sadly, as the phy-
</p>
<p>sician quietly withdrew, leaving him with his head
</p>
<p>bent and his face buried in his hands : and thus he
</p>
<p>sat when the gray dawn looked through the library
</p>
<p>windows with its cold face, reminding him his hours of
</p>
<p>work pushed on apace, regardless of his broken rest,
</p>
<p>and this last blow, which had shattered forever the
</p>
<p>already undermined palace of his trust. He had
</p>
<p>heard enough; the sword had fallen and the sun
</p>
<p>gold had all faded out of the day for him. Now in the

</p>
<p>Yet such a spirit as Kellogg' s never forgets that
</p>
<p>man in spite of all his circumstances and relations
</p>
<p>through the might of his own free will, is still his own
</p>
<p>master; creator of his fortunes and of his destiny.
</p>
<p>Standing now in the bloom of his years, with broad-
</p>
<p>ened culture, swift blood, keen nerves and an all con-
</p>
<p>quering imagination, the falcon wings of his genius
</p>
<p>bore him far away "above the dust of trivialities."
</p>
<p>But later on how is it then? When the autumn
</p>
<p>has but a few daisies left? It is another thing to see

<p>the scattered darlings trodden down. And later still,
</p>
<p>dear reader, when the shadows have grown long, and

<p>lying its delicate superstructure, as essential to its
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 129
</p>
<p>health as the roots to the forest tree, and without
</p>
<p>which it can bear no fruit.
</p>
<p>The corner stone of this edifice is virtue, around
</p>
<p>which cluster all the elements of its strength.
</p>
<p>Various organizations are framed under this name,
</p>
<p>some so radically divergent they cannot be considered
</p>
<p>as belonging to the same genesis.
</p>
<p>The best society in the world must have for its basis
</p>
<p>religion, and though there are as many religions as
</p>
<p>societies, it is becoming to have a system of faith.
</p>
<p>The community of St. Saul claimed to be composed
</p>
<p>of those Christian and moral elements most desirable to
</p>
<p>unite into an organized society; yet was it the most
</p>
<p>conglomerate mass of humanity ever collected into
</p>
<p>one corporation.
</p>
<p>Its concentrated wealth had erected magnificent
</p>
<p>temples for the worship of God, edifices built in
</p>
<p>the name of Christ and charity, while the majority
</p>
<p>of the members had as feeble an idea of the meaning
</p>
<p>of the words love and charity, as a snail has of speed.
</p>
<p>The moral warp of its ruling classes will be best
</p>
<p>understood, asjwell as the real motive actuating the
</p>
<p>votaries of wealth and fashion, by an entree into the
</p>
<p>elite circles on an occasion when these characteristics
</p>
<p>shine forth in their true colors.
</p>
<p>It was two weeks after Easter. The spring opened
</p>
<p>genial and promising at St. Saul. The moon was at

</p>
<p>Invitations had been issued for a " drawing-room "
</p>
<p>at the elegant residence of the Misses Tonguewort,
</p>
<p>given in honor of the return of the Secretary's son
</p>
<p>from Cambridge, young Lucien Evans.
</p>
<p>The soiree was to include all ages. The rich dresses
</p>
<p>expressly gotten up for the occasion, the diutinguished
</p>
<p>persons who were to lend their grand presence, and
</p>
<p>the anticipated tete-a-tetes of the sentimental youths,
</p>
<p>had paraded their brilliant visions around bewitched
</p>
<p>pillows since the cards were issued.
</p>
<p>The Misses Tonguewort were three single ladies, of
</p>
<p>uncertain age, conventionally thin and angular and
</p>
<p>entirely indebted to the arts of their Parisian Modiste
</p>
<p>for the forms they prided themselves upon. Being
</p>
<p>tall and square-shouldered, they were able to carry an
</p>
<p>incredible amount of dress displayed ( and concealed )
</p>
<p>and the more drapery they disposed about their crane-
</p>
<p>like necks, the greater the illusion. They had an
</p>
<p>erect carriage and enjoyed that peculiarly wiry, tripe-
</p>
<p>like tenacity of life, which passes for health.
</p>
<p>They were the neighbors and intimate associates of
</p>
<p>Mrs. Governor Kellogg; belonged to one of the oldest
</p>
<p>and wealthiest families of St. Saul and their social in-
</p>
<p>fluence was huge. Their entertainments were among
</p>
<p>the most recherche given at the state capital, and

<p>were graced by the presence of the Governor's family,

</p>
<p>the affair.
</p>
<p>St. Saul was remarkable for its fine looking men
</p>
<p>and ill-favored women. A beauty real when un-
</p>
<p>adorned was the exception ; but as society here as-
</p>
<p>sumed that " fine feathers make fine birds," and the
</p>
<p>ladies produced such superb effects with ther toilets
</p>
<p>that the connoiseur could find no fault, the paradox
</p>
<p>seemed established. Shades were pledged to blend, and
</p>
<p>tints to harmonize with the dark or fair countenance.
</p>
<p>So here one art, at least, the art of facial decoration,
</p>
<p>had attained perfection under the sun.
</p>
<p>O the bondage and the care
</p>
<p>In what these bodies wear,
</p>
<p>And how we dress our hair,
</p>
<p>The hauteur style and air
</p>
<p>Would drive one to despair,
</p>
<p>But for the hope and prayer
</p>
<p>To Heaven, where all is fair,
</p>
<p>To keep out fashion there!
</p>
<p>The moon full-orbed, climed up the dome of night,
</p>
<p>trailing her ethereal garments and flashing out her
</p>
<p>brilliant train of stars, as a conscious queen might
</p>
<p>tread the royal tapis of her throne, and shake out the
</p>
<p>rich folds of her sparkling robes.

<p>grand salon, whose rich furnishings were lighted up
</p>
<p>in a manner to display the collection of rare paintings
</p>
<p>and statuary and bric-a-brac to the best advantage.
</p>
<p>Until a late hour the guests were arriving and
</p>
<p>making the delightful tour of the rooms, filled with
</p>
<p>the select cullings of St. Saul.
</p>
<p>Young Lucien Evans was the. center of attraction,
</p>
<p>and around him, in animated conversation gathered
</p>
<p>a coterie of youths and maidens. A familiar counte-
</p>
<p>nance has just been added.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Veen," said Rubie Clark, extending her del-
</p>
<p>icately gloved hand, "where do you keep yourself? I
</p>
<p>supposed you were off to your Eldorado, long ago."
</p>
<p>" O no," said Stanley Veen, smiling. " I have not

<p>yet located the delightful place you mention. How-
</p>
<p>ever my plans are developing rapidly this evening

<p>" I understand you are thoroughly revolutionary in
</p>
<p>theory, and I suppose that St Saul will lose all of her
</p>
<p>pauper element, the poor house be abolished, no more
</p>
<p>home missionary work be done ; and no more charity
</p>
<p>funds raised and disbursed. Why boy, you will pre-
</p>
<p>pare the earth for annexation to Paradise; solve the
</p>
<p>social problem deeper than Soloman's riddle, and in-
</p>
<p>augurate the Millenium ! Give me a few days notice
</p>
<p>in advance. I want a bit of a spree on an aristocratic
</p>
<p>scale before we are all colonized, ground up together
</p>
<p>and put on plebeian diet with only one plate between
</p>
<p>us."
</p>
<p>" My good friends," said Stanley Veen, "you are all
</p>
<p>at sea on this social question, and are firing shots with-
</p>
<p>out definite aim. Settled as our ideas of aristocracy
</p>
<p>and plebeianism seem, they might be improved by be-
</p>
<p>ing milled again and run a few times through a seive.
</p>
<p>The true distinction might thus be given the eye, if
</p>
<p>too abstruse for mental digest.

<p>liberty and advancement, let them act now; for those

<p>who counsel destruction in North America under the

<p>existing state of affairs are incapable of construction.

</p>
<p>man and woman who has a thought above mere exist-
</p>
<p>ence. Thus may history repeat itself.
</p>
<p>" The one way we urge is this : The produ cers must
</p>
<p>incorporate to employ themselves; to own their own
</p>
<p>lands; to control their own services; to exchange their
</p>
<p>own products; to issue their own money, and to put
</p>
<p>every head of family into his or her own home, free
</p>
<p>from tax, rent and interest. This is the direct and
</p>
<p>business way of solving the problems of to-day.
</p>
<p>" It is amusing how absurdly people ruminate upon
</p>
<p>things they have never taken time to study; and how
</p>
<p>disordered one's imagination becomes, narrowed down
</p>
<p>into prescribed limits, or made to run in a particular

<p>of humanity which prompts the most intelligent, cul-
</p>
<p>tivated and prosperous to go to the help of those who
</p>
<p>have sate hitherto on the ground. Religion, too,
</p>
<p>must retrace its steps towards nature and man. Noth-

<p>not alone a manifestation of it. Character is not a
</p>
<p>means to perfection; it is perfection. Nor is it enough
</p>
<p>to call it a passport to felicity; it is felicity itself.
</p>
<p>Men and women can never be good until they are use-
</p>
<p>fully and agreeably employed.
</p>
<p>" Those who belong to the inductive school deplore
</p>
<p>the waste of enforced idleness, and plan to incorpo-
</p>
<p>rate and to systematize employments, so that there
</p>
<p>cannot be a willing arm and a kindly brain unoccu-
</p>
<p>pied, or a useful labor which is not honorable. The
</p>
<p>subject is an immense one. I hope I have made my-
</p>
<p>self clear."
</p>
<p>"Yes," replied young Evans, with a pompous
</p>
<p>shrug of his shoulders, "clear as mud. But we will be
</p>
<p>charitable enough to believe you understand yourself."
</p>
<p>"As for charity," responded Veen, "I have not
</p>
<p>found it in St. Saul, outside the lids of a dictionary.

<p>The word sounds fresh. Did you import it from Cam-

<p>evening. In truth, he was so much indisposed I did
</p>
<p>not think of anything but his changed appearance."
</p>
<p>"Ah! I was not aware of his being out of health,
</p>
<p>though I've noted his distraught air of late, and the
</p>
<p>absence of his usual high spirits. In almost any other
</p>
<p>person the change would not be so pronounced. I do
</p>
<p>not wonder he is fatigued. He has held one unbroken
</p>
<p>levee at the executive chamber for politicians all the
</p>
<p>fall. And next comes the senatorial contest. With
</p>
<p>his new book and demands of society I am surprised
</p>
<p>the man keeps a level cranium."
</p>
<p>" Have you known the Governor so long," said
</p>
<p>Stanley, "without observing his indifference to so-
</p>
<p>ciety? He is fond of his friends, and loves nothing
</p>
<p>better than to give them a feast at his own table; but

<p>"And the net receipts come next morning in the
</p>
<p>shape of a dull headache and ennui poor capital for
</p>
<p>the bread winners to work upon." responded the Gen-
</p>
<p>eral. " How do you manage to fritter away your time
</p>
<p>with these chattering magpies."
</p>
<p>"I make a sacrifice of myself one evening in the
</p>
<p>year to appease my maternal ancester, and put Cecile
</p>
<p>and I 'square' on the Grundy record. We recreate
</p>
<p>usually in the open air, and enjoy boating and riding,
</p>
<p>choosing our associates. We have neither of us im-
</p>
<p>bibed the false notions of life we are compelled to
</p>
<p>subscribe to."
</p>
<p>" How did you and your sister become such utter
</p>
<p>reprobates, with such a stiff, aristocratic parentage?"
</p>
<p>inquired the General.
</p>
<p>" I think everyone misunderstands my father," re-
</p>
<p>plied Stanley. "Then this word 'aristocracy ' is capable
</p>
<p>of so many interpretations. I cannot understand why
</p>
<p>it should be made equivocal any more than the word
</p>
<p>'virtue.' What do these people know of true aristoc-
</p>
<p>racy? They have no breeding, and the majority of
</p>
<p>them no culture. Their conversation betrays their
</p>
<p>stupidity. Their ideas of life are stilted and vapid.
</p>
<p>Wealth is their standard. Style is God, and a union
</p>
<p>with wealth the goal!"
</p>
<p>" But this cannot last always," said General Evans.

</p>
<p>" Even though he may be the son of a squaw, or
</p>
<p>have for the angel of his household a dusky-browed
</p>
<p>Commanche," said Stanley.
</p>
<p>"Whist!" said the General. "You will make me
</p>
<p>ashamed of myself for consenting to an entertainment
</p>
<p>in honor of my son. If I drop out suddenly, please
</p>
<p>suggest to Mrs. Evans and Lucien that I may be with

<p>the Governor, and they can call for me en route

<p>home."
</p>
<p>" Here is Mrs. Kellogg now," exclaimed Stanley, as
</p>
<p>both he and the General hastened to salute the lawful
</p>
<p>wife of their cherished friend.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Kellogg was magnificently attired, and hung
</p>
<p>upon the arm of the attenuated, but fluffily decked out
</p>
<p>Miss Tongue wort, senior member of the triangular
</p>
<p>house of Tongueworts.

<p>pug nose. Miss Lou Tonguewort brandished an im-
</p>
<p>mense Japanese fan, marvellously designed, which she
</p>
<p>persisted in flopping in the faces of her defenceless
</p>
<p>guests, creating an impression of single blessedness
</p>
<p>most uncomfortable and shivery.
</p>
<p>"I regret to hear the Governor is not well this
</p>
<p>evening, and we shall not have the pleasure of seeing
</p>
<p>him," said General Evans.
</p>
<p>"O he is not seriously ill by any means. The men
</p>
<p>put on more airs than a chimney sweep and more
</p>
<p>moods than a romantic school girl. The Governor is
</p>
<p>like all the rest of you men; but we ladies cannot stay
</p>
<p>at home always for the sake of humoring your whims.
</p>
<p>I told my liege-lord that I should not apologize for
</p>
<p>his absence to-night." And the stereotyped smile, or
</p>
<p>rather smirk (there was nothing natural about it)
</p>
<p>played in a sinister manner around her coarsely slit
</p>
<p>mouth.
</p>
<p>" Why don't you tell the truth," interposed Miss
</p>
<p>Tonguewort, "and say our dear Governor has
</p>
<p>denounced high toned society as ' shoddy,' and is at
</p>
<p>present writing sonnets to rustic beauties who have
</p>
<p>nothing to recommend them but a painted doll's head,
</p>
<p>and a plebeian ancestry?" And the sharp nasal
</p>
<p>organ tried to get up on its grissle, while the thin lips
</p>
<p>curled contemptously.

<p>"Monstrous!" responded the General. "This is
</p>
<p>140 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>going too far, ladies! A grim kind of a joke to crack
</p>
<p>on Governor Kellogg!" And the color rising to his
</p>
<p>temples, the General continued: " Though Alecto
</p>
<p>herself, mounted upon Bucephalus, were to canvass
</p>
<p>the city, hissing from her every serpent's tongue this
</p>
<p>tale, it would be stamped upon as the firebrand of an
</p>
<p>incendiary ! " And General Evans involuntarily closed
</p>
<p>his coat at the top, as though about to take leave of
</p>
<p>the insolent hostess.
</p>
<p>Here Mrs. Kellogg gave Miss Tonguewort a warn-
</p>
<p>ing wink; but the wormwood dipped tongue wagged on.
</p>
<p>" By the way, General, who is this new female
</p>
<p>deity?" And the weazen faced spinster, concealing
</p>
<p>her claws, awkwardly nestled closer to the General, as
</p>
<p>she endeavored to be playful. " Is she to be spoken
</p>
<p>of as

<p>That fired the Trojan boy;

<p>She has turned half the heads in St. Saul, and enjoys

</p>
<p>dignified statesman, she nearly forced him through
</p>
<p>the drapery of an alcove, when he suddenly recovered
</p>
<p>himself, drew his Roman figure up to its full height
</p>
<p>and looked upon both the ladies with supreme disgust.
</p>
<p>" I have" no amazons on my list!" said he; and bow-
</p>
<p>ing coldly, he abruptly withdrew.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Stanley Veen," pursued Miss Tonguewort,
</p>
<p>determined not to be foiled, " here is the card of an
</p>
<p>unknown Venus whose trail bafiies us! Mrs. Kel-
</p>
<p>logg and I have ransacked the directory for this, for
</p>
<p>years back, but we give it up as a conundrum. This
</p>
<p>is a serious matter with us, which already affects the
</p>
<p>welfare of individuals in the court circles of St. Saul."
</p>
<p>And the little eyes snapped significant glances at Mrs.
</p>
<p>Kellogg, as their possessor held out an innocent
</p>
<p>bit of card board, which felt limp and clammy in
</p>
<p>Stanley's hand.
</p>
<p>Poor Stanley Veen, while deciphering the blurred

<p>card, was gorgonized by a pair of lynx eyed women.

<p>Changing color. Stanley replied:

<p>" I see nothing remarkable in this card, ladies."
</p>
<p>And Stanley Veen returned the card.

<p>you knew the person named on this card you could
</p>
<p>not comprehend the methods of female witchery con-
</p>
<p>nected therewith for the avowed purpose'of breaking
</p>
<p>up sacred and happy homes." Miss Tonguewort
</p>
<p>looked almost as though, with the aid of a vegetable,
</p>
<p>known to excite the lachrymal glands, she might shed
</p>
<p>a tiny tear drop; however, the eye-lids~remained like
</p>
<p>the other parts of her exposed cuticle, arid and dusty.
</p>
<p>Stanley Veen looked stunned, but he answered:
</p>
<p>" Ladies, I do not understand the strong terms you
</p>
<p>have used in connection with the name upon that
</p>
<p>card. I am well acquainted with a young girl of the
</p>
<p>same name, but was not aware there were two names
</p>
<p>like this in the world. I will investigate the matter,
</p>
<p>as the one whom I have the honor of knowing cannot
</p>
<p>be the person referred to in your dark insinuations.
</p>
<p>No! I think the tongue of a slanderer is terribly
</p>
<p>wicked, but not capable of such moral turpitude as
</p>
<p>this! I would not submit to the thought a moment, for,
</p>
<p>though their is plenty of breathing gas for the mean
</p>
<p>millions, there is not enough for the inventor of such
</p>
<p>a falsehood to live upon one moment after Stanley
</p>
<p>Veen shall track him out! " and young Veen, pale and
</p>
<p>profoundly agitated, without so much as bowing to
</p>
<p>the ladies, who both shuddered at his words, moved on
</p>
<p>and joined his sister who seized Stanley's hand, and

<p>with her sweet smile, presented him to Mr. Hugh

</p>
<p>bitter expression, " Stanley Veen and that girl are
</p>
<p>in liaison! Did you observe the pallor of his face and
</p>
<p>the fire in his eyes? There was something terrible in
</p>
<p>it!"
</p>
<p>" Guilty, is he! " said Miss Tonguewort, " and here
</p>
<p>is the Governor, your husband, and the good Lord
</p>
<p>only knows how many more, all in her meshes ! Well,

<p>as the guardians of society ; I feel we are bound to be

</p>
<p>" Yes," said Mrs. Kellogg. "I would never have
</p>
<p>imagined a thing so bold if I had not seen it with my
</p>
<p>own eyes. Stanley was engaged in a game of croquet
</p>
<p>and suddenly from some given signal of this girl's,
</p>
<p>he dropped mallet and ran to the thicket, and La
</p>
<p>Grange seized her hat and ran for him, both dis-
</p>
<p>appearing at the same moment, and neither of them
</p>
<p>again putting in an appearance. At the banquet, both
</p>
<p>Col. and Mrs. Veen looked as though they were ready
</p>
<p>to die with mortification, and Cecile talked on in one
</p>
<p>uninterrupted stream to keep the guests from missing
</p>
<p>her brother. But it was too transparent. The brazen
</p>
<p>and disreputable performance was witnessed by more
</p>
<p>than half the company, and I tell you now, neither
</p>
<p>Stanley Veen, with all his dignity and studied im-
</p>
<p>pressiveness of manner, nor the low-born daughter of
</p>
<p>the drunkard LaGrange, with her advertised beauty,
</p>
<p>have hoodwinked the people of St. Saul regarding the
</p>
<p>real state of affairs. I have induced the Dessarts on
</p>
<p>Tipton avenue to take their daughters out of her
</p>
<p>music class; and I will see that she does not worm
</p>
<p>herself into any more of the best familes." And the
</p>
<p>brow of Mrs. Kellogg darkened, and the real fiendish-
</p>
<p>ness of her character for a moment broke through
</p>
<p>the smiling mask.

</p>
<p>" I am most happy to meet you," said Mrs. Kellogg
</p>
<p>forcing a smile to her lips yet curled with the contor-
</p>
<p>tions of jealousy.
</p>
<p>" We had hoped to see your father and mother here
</p>
<p>this evening," said Miss Lou Tonguewort
</p>
<p>" I am the bearer of their sincere regrets, my father
</p>
<p>having a particular engagement with the Governor
</p>
<p>this evening." replied Carlisle.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Kellogg winced, and Tonguewort continued:
</p>
<p>"O these politicians! They are never at leisure,
</p>
<p>and when they do go into society they are sure to leave
</p>
<p>their manners at home. I have the greatest sympathy
</p>
<p>for their wives! All expected to meet Governor Kel-

<p>log this evening, and he makes a particular engage-
</p>

</p>
<p>Carlisle.
</p>
<p>"O very much! The congregation is the largest I
</p>
<p>ever saw. There is not a vacant seat in the galleries."
</p>

<p>of style about her, and she botches the little girl up
</p>
<p>in the same fashion.
</p>
<p>Here supper was announced, and Mrs. Kellogg and
</p>
<p>young Carlisle led the way out.
</p>
<p>At table, the hostess introduced Lucien Evans as
</p>
<p>the honored guest, and young Carlisle as "the hero
</p>
<p>who stopped the Governor's runaway horses, in the
</p>
<p>memorable summer.
</p>
<p>This announcement caused the young gentleman to
</p>
<p>flush and to seize a piece of cutlery with which he
</p>
<p>rapped his audience into silence as he said:
</p>
<p>" Ladies and gentlemen : I am a hero- worshipper,
</p>
<p>but no hero. I met with the adventure of my life in
</p>
<p>your city. I was young then and in delicate health.
</p>
<p>Perhaps my vision was impaired, for I recall nothing,
</p>
<p>after getting under the hoofs of the horses, save the
</p>
<p>face of a beautiful being, who gathered me up and, as
</p>
<p>I thought, translated me bodily to Paradise! "
</p>
<p>All laughed and clapped louder than before; and
</p>
<p>again the sharp ring of cutlery was head. Order being
</p>
<p>restored, the young orator continued:
</p>
<p>" When I awoke, the houri and paradise had van-
</p>
<p>ished, and I was in one of the wards of St. Mary's
</p>
<p>Hospital, my father watching tenderly over me. For
</p>
<p>more than a year I believed myself the favored sub-
</p>
<p>ject of a miracle. But I am assured my rescuer was

<p>girl in St Saul. The romance of the affair begins to
</p>
<p>interest me."
</p>
<p>This was followed by a request for the name
</p>
<p>of the heroine ; and all but Mrs. Kellogg looked eager.
</p>
<p>Her lips moved nervously.
</p>
<p>" You will have the name, will you? " said Carlisle.
</p>
<p>" Wait until I pour a bumper of Adam's ale, and then
</p>
<p>let us drink to the health and prosperity of her to
</p>
<p>whom two important personages, besides your humble
</p>
<p>speaker owe their present existence."
</p>
<p>The glasses were filled, save the one Mrs. Kellogg
</p>
<p>held. Carlisle attempted to take it from her hand;
</p>
<p>but she held it with a vise-like grip, saying, with
</p>
<p>asperity :
</p>
<p>" Excuse me from joining in this toast The subject
</p>
<p>is well known to me, and I do not enthuse." The wife
</p>
<p>of Governor Kellogg looked as though she had swal-
</p>
<p>lowed a dose of aloes.
</p>
<p>Every eye was upon her, puzzled, yet prepared to
</p>
<p>follow her, in the same fashion as a flock of sheep
</p>
<p>will follow one which has entered a gap in- a fence.
</p>
<p>Carlisle was the impersonation of grace and ele-
</p>
<p>gance; and he held himself so erect, one could not

<p>have seen the slight protuberance between his shoul-

<p>The glass of water was lifted, all waiting for the

<p>Every ear was attentive, every eye upon the speaker,

<p>when to the amazement of all, he was seized by Cecile

</p>
<p>modest girl publicity.
</p>
<p>" I am a friend to this girl, and her name shall not

<p>be tossed from lip to lip. She has been recently orph-

<p>feelings and mine. She is a real heroine, but she is

<p>not for common talk in the world."

<p>Mrs. Kellogg writhed like a serpent, in her efforts
</p>
<p>to appear unconcerned. The Misses Tonguewort
</p>

<p>" That Mrs. Kellogg interests me," said young Car-
</p>
<p>lisle to Cecile Veen.
</p>
<p>"You do not mean to say she attracts you?" said
</p>
<p>Cecile.
</p>
<p>" No and yes; I hardly know how to define the
</p>
<p>feelings inspired by her presence. She attracts and
</p>
<p>repels me. She is a person of great power, either for
</p>
<p>good or evil; and such souls always make me sad. She
</p>
<p>evidently assumes to be a variety of things she is not;
</p>
<p>and my heart goes out to her with the strongest sen-
</p>
<p>sations of pity, feelings which almost make me
</p>
<p>ashamed to confess them.
</p>
<p>" Her position is threatened," responded Cecile.
</p>
<p>" In what way?" asked Carlisle.
</p>
<p>" They say a divorce is in the perspective. I have
</p>
<p>not heard her speak respectfully of the Governor in
</p>
<p>the past year, and her aim seems to be to undermine
</p>
<p>him in the hearts of the people."
</p>
<p>"She will never succeed!" said Carlisle.
</p>
<p>" Never! " and yet her influence is so great, and the
</p>
<p>social material she has to handle is so plastic, I trem-
</p>
<p>ble for anyone who falls into her hands. She can

</p>
<p>" I want to study her," said Carlisle. " She is phe-
</p>
<p>nomenal; end I always enjoyed a problem. Besides
</p>
<p>she may need just such a little lever as I shall prove
</p>
<p>to be, to pry up her purposes, and show her how
</p>
<p>naughty they are."
</p>
<p>" You look like working a moral reform! Scarcely
</p>
<p>seventeen, and your subject thirty-five or forty. Doc-
</p>
<p>tor Carlisle is jovial; but his son is a joker! I imag-

<p>agine I see you reforming a professional society

<p>" Supposing Hugh Carlisle exercised a little influ-
</p>
<p>ence himself. What then?"
</p>
<p>"Ah! You mean you might reform her? I \vould

<p>not discourage so noble a purpose. Yet it would seem

<p>to me impossible of accomplishment. But if you are

<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 151
</p>
<p>CHAPTEK X.
</p>
<p>When reason abdicates the throne of mind,
</p>
<p>0' what a world of beauty is undone!
</p>
<p>Thoughts, roam at random, and clear vision blind,
</p>
<p>Inquires of darkness, brasking in the sun!
</p>
<p>The Maison de Sante, a private hospital for the
</p>
<p>insane, was a noble edifice, situated at High Banks.
</p>
<p>The grounds were terraced on the river front, to
</p>
<p>the water's edge, and excursionists, passing down the
</p>
<p>river were never weary of feasting their eyes upon the
</p>
<p>green velvet staircase.
</p>
<p>The institution, though a refuge for those " who had
</p>
<p>eaten of that insane root which takes the reason pris-
</p>
<p>oner," was not conducted as are many of our modern
</p>
<p>schools of persecution for the insane. The officers in
</p>
<p>charge were humane, and the nurses under the stric-
</p>
<p>test orders to guard their helpless patients against
</p>
<p>cruelty.
</p>
<p>It was the last of June. The woods were full of
</p>
<p>beauty. The cloudless morning lay mirrored upon
</p>
<p>the shimmering surface of the river.
</p>
<p>At the river's hem, in this sequestered spot, a boat
</p>
<p>had landed with a party of four young people. As
</p>
<p>they mounted the terrace they turned their faces to
</p>
<p>note the changing view at every graduated height.

<p>" Did you know," said Hugh Carlisle, " this is a

</p>
<p>gala day at the Asylum, and all of the mild-mannered
</p>
<p>lunatics will be allowed to air and sun themselves.
</p>
<p>" Good! " said young Evans. " It will be as inter-
</p>
<p>esting as the uncaging of a menagerie. I enjoy look-
</p>
<p>ing at maniacs. It is actually a temptation to play
</p>
<p>mad for a time and avail one's self of absolute rest in
</p>
<p>a palace."
</p>
<p>" Kest, did you say? " interrupted Pearl LaGrange.
</p>
<p>" You have discovered little in the faces of the mad, if
</p>
<p>you accuse them of restfulness. They are bundles of
</p>
<p>quivering nerves; and if you get near enough to
</p>
<p>examine their faces, though they look sleep-hungry
</p>
<p>enough, they have a wild staring expression, like hunted
</p>
<p>animals. They seem forever in search of some-
</p>
<p>thing they cannot find. I do not care to meet any of
</p>
<p>the poor creatures. The memory of those I have seen
</p>
<p>makes me shudder. I always wish I had the
</p>
<p>power of helping them out of their deranged fleshly
</p>
<p>tenements, and because I have not, their presence is
</p>
<p>a reproach and horror to me.
</p>
<p>" You do not think that the soul of an insane being
</p>
<p>is shattered? " said Hugh Carlisle.
</p>
<p>"Certainly not! I do not believe it is in the least
</p>
<p>impaired; only arrested in its progress. The soul is
</p>
<p>indestructible; but its manifestations are controlled
</p>
<p>by physical conditions."

<p>" What of the idiot's soul? " said Carlisle.
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 153
</p>
<p>" O, it is all right, and may be as grand and beauti-
</p>
<p>ful as the soul of Daniel Webster. It is simply
</p>
<p>crippled, denied a normal manifestation of its God '
</p>
<p>given powers. But here we are, loitering behind, and
</p>
<p>Cecile stands at the summit, waving her handkerchief.
</p>
<p>Isn't she a glorious girl ? " said Pearl, her whole heart
</p>
<p>in the words.
</p>
<p>" I know but one her equal," said Carlisle, "and
</p>
<p>when I say she is worthy of her companionship, I have
</p>
<p>said the utmost in the praise of both. I must confess
</p>
<p>she and Lucien Evans are the handsomest pair I ever
</p>
<p>saw. It seems to me God himself ought to look down
</p>
<p>in pride upon them." And the sensitive lips of Carlisle
</p>
<p>trembled with emotion.
</p>
<p>"Yes; a fine physique makes a pleasing address
</p>
<p>always; but beautiful spirits are not the invariable
</p>
<p>occupants of such grand flesh and blood castles.
</p>
<p>The symmetrical soul invariably throws a halo of
</p>
<p>loveliness over the plainest exterior," said Pearl,
</p>
<p>thinking of Hugh's fragile form.
</p>
<p>Here their friends signalled to indicate the pres-
</p>
<p>ence of something interesting on the heights.
</p>
<p>Hugh extended his hand to Pearl, and the two made
</p>
<p>a rapid ascent; not too rapid for a stranger and tour-
</p>
<p>ist, with sketch-book in hand, to note the brilliant
</p>
<p>beauty of the girl, and the expression of purity and
</p>
<p>benevolence which lighted up the handsome counte-

</p>
<p>Enamored with the animated face of Pearl, the

<p>stranger closed his sketch-book and followed, the
</p>
<p>shrubbery enabling him to disappear now and then,
</p>
<p>and cover his pursuit.
</p>
<p>The building was a triple-gothic structure, with
</p>
<p>high and shapely defined arches and clustered col-
</p>
<p>umns over which the luxuriantly leafed ivy draped in
</p>
<p>meshes of vivid green.
</p>
<p>The patients were scattered over the grounds with
</p>
<p>visitors and friends, so none but an expert physiog-
</p>
<p>nomist could distinguish the sane from the insane.
</p>
<p>" There is a born artist among these maniacs," said
</p>
<p>HugK, addressing Pearl La Grange, "who has culti-
</p>
<p>vated a talent for painting, and she is frequently out
</p>
<p>making sketches."
</p>
<p>"I hope we can see her! " exclaimed Pearl.
</p>
<p>" Do you know she is of gentle birth, has many
</p>
<p>friends, and the story of her madness is the most
</p>
<p>touching one I ever heard. She has delineated some
</p>
<p>of the most heavenly faces, but throws them aside,
</p>
<p>renewing the effort with a higher type each time;
</p>
<p>only to discard and turn their faces to the wall, and
</p>
<p>draw again upon her imagination."
</p>

</p>
<p>lisle. " She is one of his new patients, and he is greatly

<p>interested in her, for she is the sister of Governor

</p>
<p>"I saw her once," said Evans. "She is the widow
</p>
<p>of a gallant officer killed in the struggle between the
</p>
<p>states. Their only offspring was a very promising
</p>
<p>boy of fifteen, and it seems to me he met with some
</p>
<p>awful fate which caused her to lose her mind."
</p>
<p>"What became of him?" asked Cecile.
</p>
<p>" It is a long story. Perhaps Evans can relate it,"
</p>
<p>said Carlisle.
</p>
<p>"I heard it from the Governor's own lips," said
</p>
<p>Lucien. " I may not remember the details, but their
</p>
<p>recital made an impression on me, and I have since
</p>
<p>desired to see the mother, whose anguish for her lost
</p>
<p>boy caused reason to succumb. *
</p>
<p>" Mrs. Reid was living in New York City. Her son
</p>
<p>was spending his vacation with her, and their home
</p>
<p>was at the time enlivened by a number of friends.
</p>
<p>" So endearing were the relations between this
</p>
<p>mother and son, he never passed her without throw-
</p>
<p>ing his arms around her, and bestowing caresses.
</p>
<p>This is what made the mystery of his disappearance
</p>
<p>utterly inexplicable.
</p>
<p>" The last day of their lives together had been de-
</p>
<p>lightful. After dinner, Mrs. Reid went to her room
</p>
<p>for a nap. How long she had been sleeping she could
</p>
<p>not tell, but in a semi-conscious state she heard her

</p>
<p>and brow; then the steps receded, and profound sleep
</p>
<p>ensued.
</p>
<p>" The moment she awoke, however, a presentiment
</p>
<p>of evil took posession of her, and leaping from her bed,
</p>
<p>she called wildly for her boy. He was not to be found
</p>
<p>in that mighty metropolis; and though neither money
</p>
<p>nor pains were spared in a search, never, from that
</p>
<p>hour has Eddie Reid been seen or heard from."
</p>
<p>" He may have met some terrible fate, and his body
</p>
<p>and all knowledge of the crime hidden away," said
</p>
<p>Pearl.
</p>
<p>" Perhaps yes. The secret is with God," said
</p>
<p>Lucien. " It was just as though he stepped into the
</p>
<p>land of shadows. The poor mother never gave up the
</p>
<p>search, till the light of reason went out. For more
</p>
<p>than a year the lamp was kept burning, and the front
</p>
<p>door stood ajar to welcome her child, the mother
</p>
<p>never relinquishing her watch. A group of boys pass-
</p>
<p>ing under her windows, a merry voice or whistle, and
</p>
<p>she was instantly on the street in quest of her child.
</p>
<p>" Always before renewing her search she knelt at
</p>
<p>her son's deserted bedside and prayed to God to lead
</p>
<p>her to him : and it is a little singular she did not lose
</p>
<p>her faith in God before she lost her senses. But she
</p>
<p>remains wonderfully clear upon the subject of religion
</p>
<p>and art."

</p>
<p>" What have you brought us to-day, Hugh ? " said
</p>
<p>Pearl, who had seated herself, and already commenced
</p>
<p>sketching.
</p>
<p>" I regret to say, for want of time to prepare an
</p>
<p>original paper, I have come like an empty vase to the
</p>
<p>fountain, expecting to be fed from well springs of
</p>
<p>knowledge around us.
</p>
<p>Here a succession of shrieks greeted their ears.
</p>
<p>The young people fairly trembled with the horrible
</p>
<p>vibrations, the peculiarity of which are remarkably
</p>
<p>delineated in Weber's Maniac W altzes.
</p>
<p>Just at this juncture the stranger who had followed

<p>the young people came running towards Pearl and

<p>Lucien, saying a fire had been discovered in one of

<p>the halls, and had so excited the inmates of the cells
</p>
<p>that they shrieked, throwing everything into a state

<p>of confusion, and visitors had been warned out of the
</p>
<p>enclosures, except such as were rendering aid.

<p>"I will offer my services," said Hugh, who disap-

<p>efforts, if occasion required.

</p>
<p>As Pearl and Cecile emerged from the copse, they
</p>
<p>saw smoke and flames issuing from the tower of the
</p>
<p>main structure. The inmates had been removed to
</p>
<p>adjacent buildings, and every effort was now concen-
</p>
<p>trated upon saving, if possible, the splendid edifice.
</p>
<p>A gentleman rushed excitedly across the park, call-
</p>
<p>ing wildly for a ladder, and pointing to a grated AVIII-
</p>
<p>dow over an iron balcony, against which a lady's face
</p>
<p>was closely pressed, and from which she looked in
</p>
<p>mute appeal upon the appalled spectators.
</p>
<p>The voice was Hugh's, and Pearl's marvellous pre-
</p>
<p>sence of mind, together with her characteristic prompt-
</p>
<p>ness of action in emergencies, inspired her to fly to
</p>
<p>his aid.
</p>
<p>Arrived at the scene, she realized the impossibility
</p>
<p>of making an entrance through the iron-barred case-
</p>
<p>ment in time to rescue its occupant.
</p>
<p>Pearl could hear the roar of the flames, and the air
</p>
<p>was heated round her, while the wind drove sparks
</p>
<p>and fire-brands everywhere. One fell at her feet,
</p>
<p>attracting her attention to a stake, already burning,
</p>
<p>from which a clothes line fluttered.
</p>
<p>As quick as thought Pearl tore the rope from its
</p>
<p>fastening, secured one end of it around her waist,
</p>
<p>gathered up the slack, and reaching young Evans bade
</p>
<p>him hasten with her to the entrance.

</p>
<p>" Now," said Pearl passing the extremity of the rope
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 159
</p>
<p>around Lucien' s body, " do as I bid you. There is not
</p>
<p>an instant to be lost! Two flights of stairs, then to
</p>
<p>your left. The room against the tower has but one
</p>
<p>door, you cannot miss it"
</p>
<p>Pearl's memory always served her faithfully. She
</p>
<p>had pupils in the superintendent's family, and had
</p>
<p>often climbed the tower with them to get the view from
</p>
<p>High Banks of St. Saul.
</p>
<p>Lucien Evans was not ambitious to make a hero of
</p>
<p>himself at the expense of life and beauty; but it was
</p>
<p>the bayonet push of an emergency he could not dodge;
</p>
<p>so he obeyed orders. But no sooner had he disap-
</p>
<p>peared than Pearl regretted she had not taken his
</p>
<p>place and left him in hers, at the foot of the stair-
</p>
<p>case.
</p>
<p>Moments were long minutes now. The rope seemed
</p>
<p>endless, Lucien not yet having given a perceptible
</p>
<p>pull. The fire was gaining in fury.
</p>
<p>"What if Lucien should be smothered!" thought
</p>
<p>Pearl, as she rapidly unfastened the rope from her
</p>
<p>waist, knotted it securely around the baluster and
</p>
<p>bounded up the staircase which was filled with dense
</p>
<p>smoke.
</p>
<p>So firm and reliant was her step, and so swiftly had
</p>
<p>the ascent been made, the girl had reached the sec-
</p>

<p>occasional flame revealing the way as it flashed across
</p>
<p>the open door. A moment more and she had entered
</p>
<p>the apartment.
</p>
<p>" Lucien ! " she cried.
</p>
<p>"Here I am," he said. "The lady must have been
</p>
<p>rescued. I can find nothing but the bare furniture."
</p>
<p>Here Pearl came near falling over some object
</p>
<p>which blocked her way.
</p>
<p>'Here she is!" cried Pearl. "She must have
</p>
<p>swooned. The smoke is stifling. It seems I do not
</p>
<p>breathe. I have gathered her up. She is as light as
</p>
<p>a feather. Come, O come instantly, or we are lost!"
</p>
<p>Pearl, endowed with superhuman strength to match
</p>
<p>the courage of her heart, groped with her biirden
</p>
<p>through the hall, and down the staircase ; while Luc-
</p>
<p>ien, blind and nearly smothered, dragged heavily after;
</p>
<p>nor did he realize, till all was over, that he had de-
</p>
<p>cended the two stories of the burning building empty
</p>
<p>handed, while Pearl had pushed on in advance, with
</p>
<p>something human she had picked up in the awful
</p>
<p>darkness of that smoking sepulchre.

<p>Crash! went the tower behind them, but Pearl had
</p>
<p>reached the last step.

<p>upon the threshold.
</p>
<p>The light revealed a lady's face, upturned and mo-
</p>
<p>tionless. Evans exclaimed:
</p>
<p>"Good heavens! This is the Governor's poor sis-
</p>
<p>ter, and she is dead!"
</p>
<p>"Keep her head low," said Pearl, as Hugh lifted
</p>
<p>her into his arms and took her to the surgeon's office,
</p>
<p>while Evans addressed himself to Pearl, who was now
</p>
<p>evidently suffering the reactionary effects of her pow-
</p>
<p>erful nervous strain. Conveyed to a place of safety,
</p>
<p>the party vied with each other until the remedies love
</p>
<p>suggested restored both strength and calmness.
</p>
<p>" The tower and the south porticoes are gone," said
</p>
<p>Carlisle, who returned from a tour of inspection ; "but
</p>
<p>the flames are under control, and two-thirds of the
</p>
<p>edifice will be saved; You should have seen the sur-
</p>
<p>prise of the superintendent when I told him Mrs. Reid
</p>
<p>was left to barn up in the tower."
</p>
<p>" How is our patient? " said Pearl, who was not sure
</p>
<p>Bhe had done more than to save the body from being
</p>
<p>cremated.
</p>
<p>"Mrs. Reid has opened her eyes and is rallying
</p>
<p>rapidly," said Cecile. " I think the hospital officials

<p>The sinking sun sent his red beams streaming over

<p>the little party as Hugh descended the banks and

<p>joined them, homeward bound.

<p>CHAPTEE XI.
</p>
<p>Have you heard of earth's marvelous flower,
</p>
<p>That reticent child of night's sun,
</p>
<p>Which gladdens no landscape or bower,
</p>
<p>Nor revels day's sweetness upon,
</p>
<p>Which comes in the noon of the night,
</p>
<p>A glorified presence in white,
</p>
<p>A lily of Paradise, blown
</p>
<p>From gardens of God, angel-sown,
</p>
<p>To open its golden-disc eyes,
</p>
<p>And die in the hour of surprise ?
</p>
<p>When the beautiful shutters of day,
</p>
<p>Have closed against gardens of bloom ;
</p>
<p>When the world's magna-fioral display
</p>
<p>Hides its face in night's vase of perfume,
</p>
<p>Like a gem in an Ethiop's ear,
</p>
<p>A star flaming out of a cloud,
</p>
<p>Doth this spiritual blossom appear
</p>
<p>In the pearl of its lily-white shroud.
</p>
<p>Reader, have you ever looked upon that vision of
</p>
<p>floral loveliness, the night blooming Cereus? If you

<p>have, and your soul is alive to the symbols of immor-

<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 163
</p>
<p>tality, have you not felt your senses tingle as though
</p>
<p>God had just laid a visible finger upon you?
</p>
<p>Look into the vista of its convolute corolla, for the
</p>
<p>perspective is wonderful and one may gaze into its
</p>
<p>heart through soft, radiate petals till the open ring
</p>
<p>narrows to the tiniest puncture, imbedded deep in the
</p>
<p>calyx. Here a delicate shadow envelopes the closing
</p>
<p>leaf scroll and the revelation is complete. The shadow
</p>
<p>along the vista typifies the " Valley of the Shadow of
</p>
<p>Death." The stignia of its pistil is a miniature palm
</p>
<p>tree to mellow the effulgent glories of its consumma-
</p>
<p>tion. It may say more; it may say less, according to
</p>
<p>the perceptions of the beholder; but if it bloom within
</p>
<p>your ways, go prostrate your soul before it, and wor-
</p>
<p>ship the Infinite mind which created such a wealth of
</p>
<p>wonders.
</p>
<p>The LaGrange cottage, at the close of a sultry July
</p>
<p>day, peeped through its trellis of white roses with the
</p>
<p>same meek expression which it had always worn. Like
</p>
<p>its sincere occupants it presented the status of its pos-
</p>
<p>sessions.
</p>
<p>For her pupils, their families and friends, Pearl
</p>
<p>had planned an ovation to welcome the chaste presence
</p>
<p>of this floral guest, already announced by the swelling
</p>
<p>bud.
</p>
<p>Cecile Veen had united with Pearl in putting the
</p>
<p>little cottage in order. Even aunt Meg's wardrobe

</p>
<p>had undergone inspection.
</p>
<p>164 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>One circumstance threatened to detract from the
</p>
<p>happiness of the evening. Stanley and Hugh were
</p>
<p>absent from St. Saul, the former far off on the shores
</p>
<p>of Olmira Bay, the latter spending his vacation in
</p>
<p>Canada. However, a dearer presence to Pearl was
</p>
<p>near.
</p>
<p>Doctor Carlisle had promised to come and bring
</p>
<p>with him his convalescent patient, Mrs. Reid, who,
</p>
<p>since the shock of the fire, had improved. There is a
</p>
<p>superstition attaching to sudden recovery of reason,
</p>
<p>singularly verified in the speedy demise of the sub-
</p>
<p>ject thus restored.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Reid had been removed to the Governor's,
</p>
<p>where she had every tender attention. She seemed
</p>
<p>to have no memory of the asylum ; nor did she refer
</p>
<p>to her past life; she seemed to have taken up life pre-
</p>
<p>cisely where she left it. The romance of her rescue
</p>
<p>occupied her thoughts, and as speedily as her health
</p>
<p>permitted she was granted an introduction to the dar-
</p>
<p>ing girl. This new theme furnished study for her
</p>
<p>pencil. With her brother and Dr. Carlisle, she anti-
</p>
<p>cipated being at the LaGrange cottage on the evening
</p>
<p>of the opening of the wonderful flower.
</p>
<p>During the busy preparations at the cottage, where
</p>
<p>two innocent girls were absorbed in arranging the
</p>
<p>homely appointments in such manner as to produce

<p>the finest effects, a far different scene was transpiring
</p>

</p>
<p>at the Governor's mansion. The actors were also two
</p>
<p>women, past the season when age can be disguised.
</p>
<p>Hector Kellogg and Louisa Tonguewort had been
</p>
<p>closeted together off and on for more than a week, and
</p>
<p>if two confederates of his Satanic Majesty could abide
</p>
<p>in each other's presence for such a period without
</p>
<p>hatching a brood of vipers, the walls of purgatory
</p>
<p>would appreciably shrink for want of support.
</p>
<p>The doors were securely fastened, and the ladies
</p>
<p>stood before a full length mirror, trying on two som-
</p>
<p>bre suits, with the complete paraphernalia worn by
</p>
<p>the gentle sisters of charity.
</p>
<p>" How do I look?" said the elder Tonguewort, ad-
</p>
<p>justing the folds of her sable robe and her beads and
</p>
<p>cross pendant at her side.
</p>
<p>"Elegantly! " replied her pal. " I would never be
</p>
<p>able to identify you, not in the brightest noon-day.
</p>
<p>Tell me, Lou, is this white band low enough on my
</p>
<p>forehead?"
</p>
<p>" Yes, plenty. But these costumes make one look
</p>
<p>hideously old. I feel as if I am going to prison.
</p>
<p>How trying these bonnets are. I should ' denounce
</p>
<p>the world and its vanities,' if I had to wear this fun-
</p>
<p>ereal costume."
</p>
<p>It was singular lady Kellogg did not recall by the

<p>reflection she cast in the mirror, a previous donning

</p>
<p>and more criminal. The world around her, and that
</p>
<p>good which overcometh evil, was to be congratulated
</p>
<p>that she did not, but blundered into the face of the
</p>
<p>executioner of her destiny with the tell-tale robes
</p>
<p>upon her.
</p>
<p>You have ordered Piccard to come precisely an hour
</p>
<p>later. Do you think him entirely trustworthy? "
</p>
<p>"Perfectly!" said Miss Tongue wort. "He has
</p>
<p>been our coachman for over twenty years, and knows
</p>
<p>nothing but to be faithful."
</p>
<p>" It is singular," continued Hector Kellogg, " that
</p>
<p>I have never met this Doctor Carlisle? His visits are
</p>
<p>invariably made in the evening. Mrs. Veen tells me
</p>
<p>he raves about the beauty of the LaGrange girl; and
</p>
<p>no doubt his visits here are ostensibly to inquire for
</p>
<p>Mrs. Reid, but, in reality, to discuss this fine piece of
</p>
<p>anatomy with the Governor. How stupid Mrs. Carlisle
</p>
<p>must be not to see through this. A deluded wife ex-
</p>
<p>cites one's pity.
</p>
<p>. " But for General Evans" interrupted Tonguewort,
</p>
<p>"our moral reform work would have been without
</p>
<p>flaw. We cannot be responsible for the congregation
</p>
<p>doctor Carroll attracts. Mrs. Evans has taken a stand,
</p>
<p>and if the General refuses to support her, he will go
</p>
<p>down in the same political wreck with the Governor.
</p>
<p>To remove the smirch from the gubernatorial chair,

<p>it is stated that young Evans is affianced to the ' beau-

</p>
<p>" Never you mind," replied Mrs. Kellogg, lifting her
</p>
<p>chin with supreme disdain. "Both General and Mrs.
</p>
<p>Evans have given the young man to understand that
</p>
<p>if he ever appears in public with this Pearl, he will be
</p>
<p>disinherited."
</p>
<p>" Do not nauseate me further," said Miss Tongue-
</p>
<p>wort. "There will be one advantage in this dis-
</p>
<p>guise of ours we shall not be compelled to recognize
</p>
<p>them, nor the august Cassius himself. But yours is
</p>
<p>so difficult a face to disguise. Suppose the Governor,
</p>
<p>who has penetrated all your masks, recognizes you?
</p>
<p>By all the saints in glory, if he does, you will see me
</p>
<p>vanish. I go solely to see the flower, without giving
</p>
<p>eclat by my presence, or abetting your scheme for
</p>
<p>uncovering your husband's infidelities. You are to
</p>
<p>make a careful inventory of your rival's charms to-
</p>
<p>night. How early will Piccard post the bills? It
</p>
<p>fairly makes my hair stand on end to think what a sen-
</p>
<p>sation this will produce. You are as reckless as you
</p>
<p>are unscrupulous. Remember, if darkness and dis-
</p>
<p>guises shield us, Piccard will be questioned." And
</p>
<p>Miss Tongue wort's compressed lips visibly paled at
</p>
<p>the thought.
</p>
<p>" You are a coward, Louisa Tonguewort."
</p>
<p>" The bell startled both ladies, who appeared guilty
</p>
<p>and confused.
</p>
<p>"What will you have, Mary?" said lady Kellogg,

<p>"Doctor Carroll sends up his card."
</p>
<p>" Tell him I am out. After eight, I am at the Long-
</p>
<p>worthy's soiree."
</p>
<p>When the servant delivered this message, the divine
</p>
<p>looked perplexed. " Is it possible she has forgotten
</p>
<p>the disbursement of the charity money?"
</p>
<p>Before leaving he wrote the following note:
</p>
<p>"DEAR MRS. KELLOGG:
</p>
<p>I have conferred with the
</p>
<p>Belief Association, and find they have been powerless
</p>
<p>to act for our parish poor for want of funds. A number
</p>
<p>of deaths are recorded. As this money was committed
</p>
<p>to your keeping, I am convinced that you have anti-
</p>
<p>cipated the duties of the Association. I, therefore,
</p>
<p>await with anxiety, your report regarding this most
</p>
<p>sacred church matter.
</p>
<p>Your brother in Christ,
</p>
<p>DEWITT CARROLL."
</p>
<p>As Hector Kellogg finished her pastor's note, she
</p>
<p>gave a parrot laugh. Reader, distrust that man or
</p>
<p>woman who is incapable of laughter. She had spent
</p>
<p>the money, believing that charity began at home.
</p>
<p>In the deepening twilight, through the window lat-
</p>
<p>tice of the La Grange cottage, floated the melody of a
</p>
<p>pure soprano voice accompanied by a guitar.
</p>
<p>i -. The flower had opened and its delicate breath per-
</p>
<p>fumed the waves of song.

</p>
<p>of the old Scotch guitar, while Lucien Evans, on a
</p>
<p>low stool at her feet, seemed lost in thought
</p>
<p>The love he had for Pearl was sentimental, poor and
</p>
<p>meagre, in comparison with hers. Self-love, pride
</p>
<p>and arrogance, were ruling passions of the young
</p>
<p>man's soul, to which his love for Pearl, great as it
</p>
<p>seemed to him, but played a subordinate part.
</p>
<p>Pearl had lived so naturally and healthfully, apart
</p>
<p>from the conventionalisms of fashion, the world was
</p>
<p>much more than it seemed to her naive glance; and
</p>
<p>impossibilities, endless and vast lurked everywhere in
</p>
<p>nature and life. She had yet to meet with love's first
</p>
<p>disenchantment.
</p>
<p>While this happy group were whiling away the
</p>
<p>moments, the dark figure of a man stealthily ap-
</p>
<p>proached the cottage, dropped upon his knees and
</p>
<p>crawled. Upon reaching the building, he rose to his
</p>
<p>feet, and attached a placard near the entrance to the
</p>
<p>cottage, upon the side illuminated by the street lamp.
</p>
<p>The parchment was black, and the words in white
</p>
<p>letters upon it were unholy enough to have drawn
</p>
<p>extinguishing fires from Heaven, and were designed
</p>
<p>to be read by all in St. Saul attracted thither by the
</p>
<p>flower. But in this, Satan was not to be gratified.

<p>CHAPTER XII.

<p>Such countless shapes of evil haunt the night
</p>
<p>And, like the bat, hide horrors 'neath their wings-
</p>
<p>If justice tracked and brought all to the light,
</p>
<p>Joy would be sorrow's jest for fortune's flings.
</p>
<p>"You have wound a goodly clue." Shak.
</p>
<p>As Piccard emerged from the alley the Governor's
</p>
<p>carriage swept by. He stood until he saw it stop
</p>
<p>before the cottage, and then hastened to execute the
</p>
<p>order this observation rendered imperative.
</p>
<p>The Governor was first to alight. Doctor Carlisle
</p>
<p>followed, assisting Mrs. Reid; and the two had passed
</p>
<p>over the threshold before they discovered the Gover-
</p>
<p>nor was not with them.
</p>
<p>The Governor, whose keen glance had taken in
</p>
<p>every surrounding, stood with a puzzled and perturbed
</p>
<p>expression, reading and re-reading the placard. As
</p>
<p>the metaphor flashed upon him, he as instantly tore
</p>
<p>it down, and crumpling and thrusting it into his coat
</p>
<p>pocket, he entered for the first time the domicile of
</p>
<p>Robert LaGrange.
</p>
<p>His presence here was obtained by his sister and
</p>
<p>her physician. Once, the desire to see the young

</p>
<p>personal obligations was paramount, but fate had
</p>
<p>separated them. They were strangers yet Even
</p>
<p>her name caused an involuntary shudder. Nor was
</p>
<p>this anomalous, since the fairest object may cease to
</p>
<p>be revered, when idle tongues have cheapened all its
</p>
<p>charms.
</p>
<p>As the Governor stood at the threshold he hesitated.
</p>
<p>He could not move where serpents did not flank his
</p>
<p>pathway. He had spared the innocent inmates of the
</p>
<p>LaGrange cottage the cruel stab he had just torn
</p>
<p>from their dwelling. " The offender must be ferreted
</p>
<p>out and punished" said he to himself and entered.
</p>
<p>" Why Governor," said Carlisle, " we thought you
</p>
<p>had been waylaid/ Let me present Miss LaGrange
</p>
<p>and Mrs. Forbes. Miss Veen and the others you
</p>
<p>have met."
</p>
<p>Pearl stepped forward, extended her hand and greeted
</p>
<p>the Governor with a low bow. Young Evans, not
</p>
<p>seemingly courting recognition, retained his obscure
</p>
<p>seat.
</p>
<p>As the full light haloed the faces of the two girls,
</p>
<p>Governor Kellogg turned to doctor Carlisle, remark-
</p>
<p>ing in an under tone: "If those two girls were in
</p>
<p>Borne they would speedily attract the brush of some
</p>
<p>master."
</p>
<p>" To me," said Carlisle, " they blend as harmoni-

<p>ously as the bands of aTainbow."
</p>
<p>172 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>" There is a spiritual beauty about Miss LaGrange,"
</p>
<p>replied the Governor. " Contact with the world will
</p>
<p>brush this soul-bloom off "
</p>
<p>" I differ with you. Cannot you see, under the phys-
</p>
<p>ical symmetry of a Koland, intrepidity of spirit to
</p>
<p>match?"
</p>
<p>Here Pearl's class filed in and the gentlemen joined
</p>
<p>the circle surrounding Pearl. Her face looked so
</p>
<p>beautiful.
</p>
<p>Pearl, ever thoughtful for the infirm, escorted Mrs.
</p>
<p>Reid to a chair near the open window.
</p>
<p>The doctor's attention was attracted to the door,
</p>
<p>where two sisters of charity stood surveying the com-
</p>
<p>pany from under their white scoop bonnets. They
</p>
<p>seemed to hesitate about advancing into the room.
</p>
<p>Pearl stepped forward, bringing them into notice, as
</p>
<p>she conducted them to the flower.
</p>
<p>Doctor Carlisle, suddenly left Mrs. Reid's side
</p>
<p>to join the group. His manner was excited, as he
</p>
<p>stood intently gazing into the face of the taller of the
</p>
<p>two sisters, a brawny woman with cold gray eyes, which
</p>
<p>were fixed upon Pearl with a devouring look.
</p>
<p>Doctor Carlisle had found the object of his years of
</p>
<p>search. Could he let her go?
</p>
<p>" Perhaps," thought he, "she has repented. Had the
</p>
<p>lash of conscience driven her to this garb?"

</p>
<p>his breast, and his lips parted to pronounce the name
</p>
<p>engraved thereon, he stood for the second time con-
</p>
<p>fronting the woman he had searched far and wide to
</p>
<p>find. Yet her robes declared her heart now sacred.
</p>
<p>Conceding this excited pity, but he must have an in-
</p>
<p>terview with this woman, if forced upon the confess-
</p>
<p>ional stair to obtain it. What meant that menacing
</p>
<p>look she cast upon Pearl?
</p>
<p>Doctor Carlisle surprised himself by a movement
</p>
<p>of his right hand, which tilted the sister's white bon-
</p>
<p>net back from her angry visage. Their eyes met.
</p>
<p>The practiced duplicity of the woman saved her from
</p>
<p>swooning. She realized the horrible abyss over which
</p>
<p>she was suspended, and knew her mask would only
</p>
<p>serve her if she instantly escaped her mortal enemy.
</p>
<p>Pulling the skirts of her companion, the danger-
</p>

<p>the new day dawns, ah, then God! pity those whose
</p>
<p>dreams are shattered memories!
</p>
<p>As the Governor's carriage door closed the sound
</p>
<p>of Pearl's voice attracted his music loving ear. All
</p>
<p>listened. There was a ravishing sweetness in her
</p>
<p>tones, rarely combined with the strength and energy
</p>
<p>displayed in her crescendoes, while the ease and de-
</p>
<p>licacy of her shading was masterly.
</p>
<p>It was Pearl's own arrangement, and each word
</p>
<p>seemed laden with the wealth of her poetic and im-
</p>
<p>passioned soul, as she sang;
</p>
<p>Love me, love! love me ever,
</p>
<p>Time is but a mortal breath.
</p>
<p>Love me now, henceforth, forever!
</p>
<p>Love is life, Oblivion, death!
</p>
<p>Through eternity, love me,
</p>
<p>Till the stars are duller grown,
</p>
<p>Till in heart and soul I crown thee
</p>
<p>Love's divinity, my own!

<p>The swift recording angel drove his quill
</p>
<p>With such celerity it seemed to fly
</p>
<p>And hurl its record down of human ill,
</p>
<p>As erst the lightning leapt from murky sky
</p>
<p>On Jove, defiant Titans it would kill ;
</p>
<p>And yet, the record in its darkest dye,
</p>
<p>Was incomplete: not half the ills were shown;
</p>
<p>And those that were so, were not half writ down.

<p>"Let us go" said Mrs. Reid, as the guitar dis-

</p>
<p>coursed the prelude to another song. " The plaintive
</p>
<p>tone of that voice thrills me strangely."
</p>
<p>"Come, come, sweet sister! No more gloomy pic-
</p>
<p>tures. Look out upon the heavens, and read a happy
</p>
<p>horoscope for me, when cares of state shall fall like
</p>
<p>gyves from off my wrists, and I may be set free!
</p>
<p>For I'm a prisoner! Bound in chains
</p>
<p>Invisible as air;
</p>
<p>Yet stronger than the links which clank
</p>
<p>In dungeons of despair.
</p>
<p>For Freedom is to me myth,
</p>
<p>The untried spirit wing;
</p>
<p>The jest of time, the one brave note,
</p>
<p>Which birds alone can sing!
</p>
<p>'Bound fast in fate' the savans say,
</p>
<p>With human will set free.

<p>Laugh, winds of heaven, which circling plow
</p>
<p>Deep furrows in the sea!
</p>
<p>Shout in derision as ye sweep
</p>
<p>The forest arches through,
</p>
<p>And brew the royal oxygen
</p>
<p>For planet life anew.
</p>
<p>My orbit is the line of fate,

<p>Traced by an unseen hand ;

<p>The same which my divine estate

</p>
<p>the presentiment of evil which possessed her might
</p>
<p>never have assumed the reality of horrors. And now
</p>
<p>it was not for herself she shuddered; as her head
</p>
<p>rested upon his heart, for her answer revealed com-
</p>
<p>plete disregard for self.
</p>
<p>"Believe me," she said, Pearl LaGrange is born to
</p>
<p>cope with great vicissitudes. Her beauty is of a type
</p>
<p>to sadden. A modern mistic maintains that ' it is bet-
</p>
<p>ter to die than to be born.' "
</p>
<p>" But you would not appoint your modern Guidetta
</p>
<p>unto death?" said Doctor Carlisle.
</p>
<p>"Yes, I would?" responded the enthusiastic friend
</p>
<p>of Pearl LaGrange. " If I did not fear you would
</p>
<p>both mistrust as taking new leave of my senses, I would
</p>
<p>tell you my best wishes for this unfortunate girl."
</p>
<p>" Give us the dainty wish, sister," said Kellogg.
</p>
<p>" I predict a society sensation, and such a one as has
</p>
<p>never before convulsed the elite circles of St. Saul,

<p>when Lucien Evans takes his bride to Ivy Tower,

</p>
<p>would create a greater scattering of crinoline."
</p>
<p>" I hear the General's family are opposed to this
</p>
<p>marriage," said Doctor Carlisle.
</p>
<p>"They are," said the Governor; "on the fancied
</p>
<p>grounds of inequality, I believe I have it from the

<p>Scotch nobility. The girl has patrician beauty, and
</p>
<p>her accomplishments please the General ; but his shal-
</p>
<p>low brained wife has that pride which goeth before
</p>
<p>destruction. She idolizes her son. The General has
</p>
<p>advised her to put him in a glass case, as he is too
</p>
<p>ornamental to be useful. His pedigree will bring him
</p>
<p>to grief yet. The age demands that proof of ances-
</p>
<p>tral greatness which fruits in a worthy issue."
</p>
<p>The Governor concluded his not altogether com-
</p>
<p>plimentary panegyric on young Evans by saying the
</p>
<p>opportunity of his life was upon him, and his future
</p>
<p>would be colored by the fight he must make against
</p>
<p>maternal opposition and social prejudice.
</p>
<p>" Surely you are not going to resume work at this
</p>
<p>hour ? said Doctor Carlisle, as the carriage stopped
</p>
<p>before the grand entrance to the capitol.
</p>
<p>"True" said Kellogg, " Good night."
</p>
<p>" I have done what I never did before," said Mrs.
</p>
<p>Reid, as, with a sigh, she settled back into the cush-
</p>
<p>ions. " I have watched brother out of my sight. You
</p>
<p>know the superstition?"
</p>
<p>"I am not a believer in signs," said the doctor.
</p>
<p>Doctor Carlisle was very fond of Governor Kellogg.
</p>
<p>Of the Governor's domestic misfortunes he knew abso-
</p>
<p>lutely nothing. That he was above ordinary men, was
</p>
<p>proved in the fact of his ability to suffer domestic bar-

<p>duties of his office. His dignified reserve protected the
</p>
<p>reputation of his wife; but reputation and character
</p>
<p>are not always the twin companions nature designed
</p>
<p>them to be.
</p>
<p>" Mrs. Kellogg is still out of the city, I believe,"
</p>
<p>said doctor Carlisle.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hied shuddered, as she replied: "Yes; that
</p>
<p>is, I suppose she is. She has a way of departing and
</p>
<p>arriving quite novel of late, and only by tapping
</p>
<p>at her door is her absence or presence made known to
</p>
<p>us. It is no disparagement to either brother or his
</p>
<p>wife that their relations are inharmonious. It is sim-
</p>
<p>ply a mutual misfortune that they should ever have
</p>
<p>come together."
</p>
<p>The carriage now approached the Governor's resi-
</p>
<p>dence, and a bright light flamed from the balcony
</p>
<p>window.
</p>
<p>" She has come," said Mrs. Reid, "and now it is not
</p>
<p>too late for you to come in and make her acquain-
</p>
<p>tance."
</p>
<p>" No, excuse me. Not to-night," said he.
</p>
<p>" Would there be any impropriety in my giving
</p>
<p>your brother a professional nudge on my way home?
</p>
<p>It is past the hour for bores you know," said the doc-

<p>tor playfully.

<p>" Sup'pose I tell him the house is on fire. The ends
</p>
<p>will justify the means, will they not? "
</p>
<p>"O yes! " said Mrs. Reid as she closed the door,
</p>
<p>saying to herself: " I should have insisted upon the
</p>
<p>doctor's introduction to Hector to night, just to keep
</p>
<p>a human presence near. It seems to me I would give
</p>
<p>everything I have, but the hope of immortality, for
</p>
<p>the presence of some friend to-night! And she entered
</p>
<p>her sleeping room, under the cloud of presentiment
</p>
<p>Some moments in advance of this lady, a strange
</p>
<p>looking object entered at the rear of the building,
</p>
<p>glided up the back stair-case, and forcing the lock,
</p>
<p>entered the Governor's private sleeping room.
</p>
<p>At every step the rustling of her dress, or the thump-
</p>
<p>ing of her heart, which, since her flight from the La
</p>
<p>Grange cottage had not ceased to flutter, made her
</p>
<p>pause, lest she should be surprised in her nefarious
</p>
<p>preliminaries for flight
</p>
<p>"Hector Kellogg," she whispered, "you are a fool
</p>
<p>and a fizzle." She was startled by the quick, nervous
</p>
<p>footsteps of Mrs. Reid.
</p>
<p>" She is a born detective. All is lost if she looks
</p>
<p>into my face." And she shut her door with a bang
</p>
<p>and pushed the bolt. Then, with her ear to the key-
</p>
<p>hole, she listened till the invalid entered her bed room.
</p>
<p>She then proceeded to collect valuables including
</p>

<p>Her depraved imagination took satisfaction in the
</p>
<p>thought of creating a sensation by flight, " forced
</p>
<p>upon her by the infidelity of her husband," which
</p>
<p>must effectually bar him from divorce. As for Doctor
</p>
<p>Carlisle he might search the Convent and haunt the
</p>
<p>Sisterhood for a time, but must eventually give up
</p>
<p>the pursuit.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Reid had just completed a beautiful portrait
</p>
<p>of Pearl LaGrange. So true a likeness was it, its fair
</p>
<p>delineator might have addressed it as did one of the
</p>
<p>old masters: "I have done all I can for you; now
</p>
<p>speak!"
</p>
<p>To bear away this trophy involved entering the
</p>
<p>bed chamber of Mrs. Reid, who was so light a sleeper
</p>
<p>that the slightest noise might rouse her. The picture
</p>
<p>hung upon the wall over the sleeper. Hector Kel-
</p>
<p>logg had a cat-like tread. So hurriedly turning the
</p>
<p>hall light down, she softly entered the artist's bed
</p>
<p>chamber. A pale beam of light, as if beseeching
</p>
<p>mercy, stole in through the door, revealing the white
</p>
<p>face of the sleeper. Hector Kellogg took a back step
</p>
<p>here to brace herself before the commission of the
</p>
<p>dastardly deed. The close wall involved the feat of
</p>
<p>clambering over the high foot board, and bridging the
</p>
<p>remaining distance as best she could.

</p>
<p>Raising herself noislessly, and listening between
</p>
<p>each effort, this gaunt shadow at last attained a posi-
</p>
<p>tion upon the side of the bed, and stretched out her
</p>
<p>arms towards the picture.
</p>
<p>If Darwin ever had any doubts as to the actuality
</p>
<p>of " the missing link," they might have been dissipa-
</p>
<p>ted, could he have witnessed this tableau.
</p>
<p>Alas, that sin should have led Hector Kellogg
</p>
<p>to such lengths. The picture was very heavy. It
</p>
<p>could be reached only on tiptoe.
</p>
<p>Awkwardly as possible, she raised herself till her
</p>
<p>hands could grasp the outer edges of the picture. In
</p>
<p>lifting it from the nail she lost her balance, the por-
</p>
<p>trait slipped from her hand, and in her efforts to re-
</p>
<p>cover it, was hurled towards the bed, striking with
</p>
<p>fatal force one of its sharp corners into the temple of
</p>
<p>the sleeper.
</p>
<p>Her lips softly murmured: "Eddie, my darling,
</p>
<p>have you come at last! " and silence fell upon the room
</p>
<p>as suddenly as the death blow had been given.
</p>
<p>The shocking accident made Hector Kellogg hesi-
</p>
<p>tate till fear inspired immediate flight.
</p>
<p>She had already relieved the bouse of every valu-
</p>
<p>able. She would put it under the robber's spell, in
</p>
<p>the attitude of having been ransacked and pillaged.

<p>manifested by a gradual settling of Miss Tongue-

<p>wort's body into her toilet, and of the latter over the

<p>Mrs. Carlisle sprang forward and assisted her to

<p>the chair she had just abandoned.

<p>Louisa Tonguewort opened her eyes and seeing Pearl
</p>
<p>bounded from the ecclesiastical cushions, landing
</p>
<p>between Mrs. Veen and lady Evans. Her rudeness
</p>
<p>was observed by Cecile, who hastened to relieve Pearl's
</p>
<p>discomfiture, by assuring her the abrupt manners of
</p>
<p>the lady were due entirely to a morbid, spasmodic
</p>
<p>action of the muscles. But Pearl was far from being
</p>
<p>comforted by the kindness of her friend. She had en-
</p>
<p>dured the sting of poverty too long to be susceptible
</p>
<p>to apologies. The haughty salutation, the studied
</p>
<p>reticence, the vulgar scorn, and had she not suffered
</p>
<p>all this, and more for years, to keep her place at
</p>
<p>Cecile's side.
</p>
<p>"The gulf between the rich and poor has never
</p>
<p>been and never can be spanned by any but the bridge
</p>
<p>of Christ's pure charities," thought Pearl.
</p>
<p>"What is it, dear heart?" said Pearl, addressing
</p>
<p>Cecile Veen, as the two, arm in arm, moved off to-
</p>
<p>gether. " Do I look terrible as an army with ban-
</p>
<p>ners; or what are the repellent qualities I wear to-
</p>

</p>
<p>" You! " said Cecile tenderly. " Why you are sim-

</p>
<p>Lucien, parting the girls and joining them in a
</p>
<p>promenade said: "The Governor is divorced from Mrs.
</p>
<p>Kellogg. I read the announcement in this evening's
</p>
<p>Journal.
</p>
<p>" This is the result of a joke on her part, intended

<p>only as a domestic pleasantry, to which his austere

<p>displeasure affixes the seal of eternal separation, by

<p>annulling in toto the marriage bond," said young

<p>Evans, who looked sincerely sorry for Mrs. Kellogg,
</p>
<p>having no knowledge of the secret
</p>
<p>"But your news is almost stale," responded Cecile.

<p>Evans.

<p>If tears could bring back the gentle hearted sister,

<p>Pearl and I would shed enough.
</p>
<p>"Cecile! You are positively cruel to-night What
</p>
<p>think you, my fair one?" said Evans, addressing
</p>
<p>Pearl.
</p>
<p>" I have no knowledge of the relations between
</p>
<p>this unfortunate pair, so I reserve my opinion. An
</p>
<p>impartial judgment like mine, would only be rejected
</p>
<p>with contempt, since there appears to be two stalwart
</p>
<p>sides to the question, and both are struggling for
</p>
<p>supremacy. It is such. a shocking predicament to be

<p>in, when one's sacred affairs are tabled and carved up

<p>which, though dead now, once animated and made

</p>
<p>that the youth and personal attractions of Louisa

</p>
<p>The premature nature of the question was startling

<p>when all knew the Tongueworts unreservedly espoused

</p>
<p>after Mrs. Kellogg' s flight, it is expedient to review
</p>
<p>a few unrecorded incidents in that lady's history,
</p>
<p>causes recognized by the statutes of the several states
</p>
<p>as sufficient to render his marriage void.
</p>
<p>On the evening of doctor Carlisle's important dis-
</p>
<p>covery, having seen Mrs. Reid within the door of her
</p>
<p>brother's mansion, he repaired to the executive cham-
</p>
<p>ber, to confer with the Governor upon the most feas-
</p>
<p>able means of following to a successful clearing up
</p>
<p>the mystery, a clue having been unexpectedly furn-
</p>
<p>ished him at the LaGrange cottage that evening.
</p>
<p>In enlisting the Governor's interest doctor Carlisle
</p>
<p>was impelled to impart a secret, known only to him-
</p>
<p>self, his wife, and the lady who played the leading
</p>
<p>role in the dark drama. If he had sent a thousand
</p>
<p>poisoned arrows into the bosom of his friend, he
</p>
<p>could not have inflicted deeper wounds.
</p>
<p>When the cup of bitterness is brimming, a drop or

<p>strength of the draught; yet there are limits, when

<p>span its defining line beyond which human endurance

</p>
<p>interview, was constrained, and so insincere he felt
</p>
<p>that he had not reciprocated in part the unreserved
</p>
<p>confidences of his worthy friend. But shocking as
</p>
<p>the Doctor's revelations were, they scarcely prepared
</p>
<p>him for the guilty witnesses which met him on the
</p>
<p>threshold of his home.
</p>
<p>In the presence of death the additional misfortune
</p>
<p>of robbery and pillage visible throughout the castle,
</p>
<p>made little impression on the bereaved man; but
</p>
<p>when, upon reaching the threshold of his chamber, he
</p>
<p>stepped upon the chain of beads and held this up for
</p>
<p>inspection, he could endure no more. The strong
</p>
<p>man sank within him. Almighty love alone could
</p>
<p>here forgive.
</p>
<p>Upon his couch, scarcely less pallid and statue- like
</p>
<p>than his cold, dead sister, Governor Kellogg was found
</p>
<p>unconscious, when Doctor Carlisle was summoned to
</p>
<p>the house some hours later, on the morning succeeding

<p>their interview.
</p>
<p>Until the Governor recovered consciousness he was
</p>
<p>supposed to have been rendered senseless by the
</p>
<p>burglars who had ransacked and robbed the house.
</p>
<p>With his return to consciousness, the Governor re-
</p>
<p>solved to take the legal steps for severing the bond

<p>which constituted the wretched thraldom of his mar-
</p>
<p>riage. None but he had noticed the peculiar mark

</p>
<p>From little children, Pearl LaGrange and Lucien
</p>
<p>Evans had associated together.
</p>
<p>Before his college days, in the long, cold winters,
</p>
<p>when snow-drifts hedged the hedges, and the paths
</p>
<p>to and from the school house were lost, Lucien' s sled
</p>
<p>could be seen every morning, waiting at the gate for
</p>
<p>little Pearl ; and as all the other girls had brothers or
</p>
<p>fathers to bring them, it was considered by all the
</p>
<p>school the loveliest picture to see Lucien Evans, who
</p>
<p>had no little sister, and Pearl LaGrange who had no
</p>
<p>big brother, going to school.
</p>
<p>Their love-making had been a very old-fashioned
</p>
<p>affair, belonging to each other before they undersiood
</p>
<p>the nature of love, or the obligation of a plighted
</p>
<p>troth.
</p>
<p>That Lucien Evans and Pearl LaGrange were des-
</p>
<p>tined to be husband and wife from the dawn of crea-
</p>
<p>tion, was as much a fact to Pearl, as the religion of
</p>
<p>her fathers.
</p>
<p>General and Mrs. Evans were aware of the attach-
</p>
<p>ment, but Mrs. Evans viewed it as childish and eph-
</p>
<p>emeral; and only after Lucien's return from college
</p>
<p>did she deem it " a foe worthy of her steel."
</p>
<p>A highly "eligible match " had been planned by
</p>
<p>the idolatrous mother for her only son; a marriage
</p>
<p>which would unite the wealth of two old families.

</p>
<p>None in the generations which proceeded her had
</p>
<p>194 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>been guilty of dying for love. Given to the dissipa-
</p>
<p>tion of reading the trashy literature of the day, Mrs.
</p>
<p>Evans was well versed in intrigue, and had developed
</p>
<p>plans which she felt would bring her selfish desires.
</p>
<p>The General manifested an indifference. To his
</p>
<p>mind the beauty and intellectual gifts of Pearl La-
</p>
<p>Grange, more than offset the social position of Miss
</p>
<p>Ruby Clark, who was only a girl of mediocre talent.
</p>
<p>He secretly prayed for the marriage of his son and
</p>
<p>the orphaned child of Robert LaGrange. " It would
</p>
<p>be such a delicate and salutary innovation upon the
</p>
<p>artificial and heartless family lives they are all lead-
</p>
<p>ing," thought he.
</p>
<p>But women even those who are united to great
</p>
<p>men intellectually, whom they recognize as their su-
</p>
<p>periors never concede a point which has been pri-
</p>
<p>vately settled in their own minds. They may seem to
</p>
<p>have yielded so completely are their untenable argu-
</p>
<p>ments reasoned away but upon returning to them-
</p>
<p>selves, let but a jest be uttered upon the subject, and
</p>
<p>they relapse into their old warp of thinking. To con-
</p>
<p>vince a woman of her folly is to surprise her while
</p>
<p>she is gnawing upon the dead sea fruits of it. The
</p>
<p>nobility of confessing the fault is waived, because
</p>
<p>there is no way out, save through this humiliation.

</p>
<p>Mrs. Evans' nature was not deep enough to make
</p>
<p>her an extremely vicious person.
</p>
<p>So the mental suggestion of a new departure socially,
</p>
<p>which, if carried out, would have forced recognition
</p>
<p>and respect from the entire world of her acquaint-
</p>
<p>ance, the wife of the General had neither the great-
</p>
<p>ness of spirit nor the largeness of heart to inaugurate.
</p>
<p>Lucien was called away from St. Saul for a few
</p>
<p>days, and a way was opened for an interview, either
</p>
<p>in person or by letter, with his affianced bride. The
</p>
<p>success of her overtures was built entirely upon her
</p>
<p>knowledge of the amiable disposition and heroic char-
</p>
<p>acter possessed by the girl, whose probity she inten-
</p>
<p>ded to test by writing her a strictly confidential letter,
</p>
<p>and without consulting the General, whose consent
</p>
<p>she knew never would be given. She would make a
</p>
<p>joint request to postpone, or relinquish the prospec-
</p>
<p>tive marriage. It was enough that the social position
</p>
<p>demanded the effort, and justified the means.
</p>
<p>Thus it came to pass, on the evening after Lucien
</p>
<p>Evans' business departure from St. Saul, Pearl La-
</p>
<p>Grange was surprised at the reception of a drop let-
</p>
<p>ter, addressed in an unknown hand. An appreciation

<p>of the inwardness of this vain woman's heart and

<p>196 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>St. Saul, Oct. 18.
</p>
<p>Miss PEARL LAGKANGE:
</p>
<p>General Evans and myself are annoyed and
</p>
<p>shocked at the rumor gaining credence daily in St.
</p>
<p>Saul of your approaching marriage with our son,
</p>
<p>and I must say the order of social etiquette is re-
</p>
<p>versed, when we humiliate ourselves at your feet, sue-
</p>
<p>ing for the revolvement of this preposterous canard,
</p>
<p>already mounting the altar stairs of St. Mark's. Con-
</p>
<p>sidering the very great improprieties of such an au-
</p>
<p>dacious society ilight on your part, and the covert and
</p>
<p>unfilial conduct of an idolized son, who for his own
</p>
<p>amusement, or otherwise, keeps up the absurdities of
</p>
<p>such an illusion, impresses us that your daring ex-
</p>
<p>ceeds your discretion.
</p>
<p>A favorite in society, and flattered by an admiring
</p>
<p>circle of friends, Lucien finds himself in a dilemma,
</p>
<p>not unusual, but very unpleasant; and while he de-
</p>
<p>sires to honor our choice in his marriage, he is held
</p>
<p>back from so doing by the unfortunate fetters you
</p>
<p>have thrown around him, and insist upon welding at
</p>
<p>the altar.
</p>
<p>When young people rush madly and unreasoningly
</p>
<p>into serious life purposes, it becomes their parents, or
</p>
<p>superiors to remind them of the insuperable barriers
</p>
<p>which block their too ambitious ways. I have known
</p>
<p>very good things of you in the past. I have heard
</p>
<p>much in your praise of late; but whatever you have
</p>
<p>been, or are, or hope to be, yo'u cannot advance your-
</p>
<p>self or your sphere by an alliance with one who moves

</p>
<p>We do not declare this to be our internal view of
</p>
<p>the matter; but it is a distinction the world makes,
</p>
<p>and we are compelled to subscribe to it.
</p>
<p>I hear you are heroic and self-sacrificing; and do
</p>
<p>not believe you have ever seriously considered what a
</p>
<p>young man in the highest walks of life sacrifices to
</p>
<p>wed a girl below him in wealth and station.
</p>
<p>You have possibly taken only a one-sided view of
</p>
<p>the results of such unusual matches, overlooking the
</p>
<p>awkward plights and onerous obligations which array
</p>
<p>themselves against you, and the unhappy outcome of
</p>
<p>your rose-colored plans.
</p>
<p>Weigh the momentous results of so incongruous a
</p>
<p>union, and I am sure you will step back into the sphere
</p>
<p>you now adorn. If love attracts, more than position
</p>
<p>dazzles you, you surely could not plunge the loved
</p>
<p>one irredeemably into a social quagmire, out of which
</p>
<p>there is but one reputable earthly escape ; but, having
</p>
<p>it in your power to give him the highest proof of your
</p>
<p>affections in restoring his personal freedom to him,
</p>
<p>you make available the grandest opportunity of your
</p>
<p>life for the display of those reputed and highly dis-
</p>
<p>tinguishing qualities of yours, and win in spontane-
</p>
<p>ous gratitude, more than you ever possessed in making
</p>
<p>an unwilling captive of love!
</p>
<p>In the event of proving yourself equal to this notable
</p>
<p>life-occasion, with an unqualified renunciation of the
</p>
<p>past, and all of its rustic pledges, we promise, not
</p>
<p>only to hold you in grateful esteem forever, but to
</p>
<p>reward you in a manner far more substantial and ac-

<p>have anticipated our son's purposes. If so, we trust
</p>
<p>you will spare him all needless anxiety and unhappi-
</p>
<p>ness concerning yourself, by taking refuge in the con-
</p>
<p>solatory fact that all men are inconstant by nature, as
</p>
<p>readily adapting themselves to changes in love, as in
</p>
<p>scenery.
</p>
<p>Again assuring you of a reward commensurate with
</p>
<p>this sacrifice, the arbitrary customs of society rather
</p>
<p>than ourselves demand of you,
</p>
<p>We remain^
</p>
<p>Very truly yours,
</p>
<p>GENERAL, AND MRS. EVANS.
</p>
<p>Glancing hurriedly at the signature, before she
</p>
<p>read the letter, Pearl retired to her little bed-room,
</p>
<p>supposing she had been honored as her position
</p>
<p>justified her in every way to except with an episto-
</p>
<p>lary greeting from Lucien's parents; and wishing to
</p>
<p>enjoy the first reading of their congratulations alone,
</p>
<p>and then share its contents with faithful Aunt Meg.
</p>
<p>The room was in that natty, pleasing, and never to
</p>
<p>be misconstrued confusion which so eloquently be-
</p>
<p>speaks the presence of a young lady in the house.
</p>
<p>Cecile Veen had just left the cottage, and the lovely

<p>wedding wardrobe having been examined and dis-
</p>
<p>cussed by the two girls, at least for the twentieth time

<p>of solar morning light.
</p>
<p>And now, surrounded by all of those voiceful em-
</p>
<p>blems of a happy future of love and usefulness, with
</p>
<p>her imagination quickened into an ecstacy of delight,
</p>
<p>as she realized the grand possibilities in the widen-

<p>ing spheres of love and work before her, in the very
</p>
<p>breath of the roses, budding for her bridal, she reads
</p>
<p>the cold, stinging words of that letter. Had the earth
</p>
<p>opened at her feet, and as suddenly closed over her
</p>
<p>and all her belongings, Pearl LaGrange could not
</p>
<p>have been more completely paralyzed.
</p>
<p>It was in the early morning hours when the letter
</p>
<p>came, and the room and the wedding garments were
</p>
<p>bathed in the gold-bloom of an Indian summer at-
</p>
<p>mosphere.
</p>
<p>It was twilight now. The shadows crept in through

<p>the open casement The winds sighed heavily, and

<p>CHAPTER XVII.
</p>
<p>Say what you will, an oral word
</p>
<p>Is only thrilling while 'tis heard,
</p>
<p>And only treasured while the ear
</p>
<p>Invokes the tribute, smile or tear.
</p>
<p>E'en sweetest words upon the tongue
</p>
<p>A thousand times declared and sung,
</p>
<p>Must be a thousand times renewed,
</p>
<p>Or they are lost or misconstrued.
</p>
<p>But let the hasty pen declare
</p>
<p>In indignation or despair,
</p>
<p>Words tempered like a blade of steel,
</p>
<p>To pierce where most the heart can feel,
</p>
<p>And you have proved your written word
</p>
<p>Far mightier than the two-edged sword.
</p>
<p>When Cecile Veen entered the LaGrange cottage,
</p>
<p>the morning after the discussion of the wardrobe, it was
</p>
<p>to find Aunt Meg in the chair by the window, where
</p>
<p>she had napped in watching and waiting for Pearl's
</p>
<p>return.
</p>
<p>The atmosphere was stifling with lamp smoke, and
</p>
<p>the old lady's countenance wore a most pitiable expres-
</p>
<p>sion which was reflected in Cecile's face, upon learn-
</p>
<p>ing that Pearl had not been sought in her room, so
</p>
<p>confident was her aunt that the two girls had passed
</p>
<p>out together.
</p>
<p>Cecile opened Pearl's door. Pearl was there, still
</p>
<p>as the wedding garments which shrouded all but her

</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 201
</p>
<p>To determine whether Pearl's presence was one of
</p>
<p>life or death, was the work of a moment.
</p>
<p>Uncovering Pearl to her heart, Cecile pressed her
</p>
<p>face closely down. " God be praised! " she murmured,
</p>
<p>"Pearl lives!" Cecile summoned and conducted
</p>
<p>Doctor Carlisle to Pearl's bedside, without exciting a
</p>
<p>suspicion of any unusual occurrence.
</p>
<p>"Oh, can you not rouse her, doctor?" pleaded Ce-
</p>
<p>cile, as she covered Pearl's cold face with kisses, call-
</p>
<p>ing upon her in the most endearing terms to open her
</p>
<p>eyes.
</p>
<p>The physician replied assuringly: "There is not
</p>
<p>the slightest danger of death in rest like this."
</p>
<p>As Doctor Carlisle turned to leave the room, he
</p>
<p>paused and looked back to take the lovely picture in
</p>
<p>again and carry it with him. The contrast in these two
</p>
<p>beautiful girls occupied his imagination as he meas-
</p>
<p>ured with swift steps the distance to his office.
</p>
<p>Doctor Carlisle had never before separated the two
</p>
<p>girls long enough to make any comparison between
</p>
<p>them. His interest naturally centered in Cecile Veen,
</p>
<p>who, if not the coming daughter of his house, was
</p>
<p>still the object of his youthful son's Byronic worship.
</p>
<p>As the door closed upon Doctor Carlisle, Pearl's
</p>
<p>eyelids quivered. Opening wide, her vision rested
</p>
<p>with a sad surprise, long and silently upon the tender

<p>face bending over her; and, as if afraid to break the
</p>
<p>202 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>spell, both gazed into each other's souls as spirits may
</p>
<p>embrace. Pearl raised herself up, pointing to the ta-
</p>
<p>ble which was covered with closely written sheets
</p>
<p>and two addressed envelopes, one in a cramped hand,
</p>
<p>bearing Pearl's address and post-marked St. Saul.
</p>
<p>"I see," said Cecile, "my chum has made her will."
</p>
<p>" Yes, it is my will. Read and make haste. It is
</p>
<p>late, and Lucien's mother waits my answer."
</p>
<p>"Ah? Then it is as I feared. These brainless,
</p>
<p>heartless, fashion-lunatics, whose souls might all be
</p>
<p>balanced on the point of a cambric needle without
</p>
<p>fear of jostling each other, have dared to frighten you
</p>
<p>in Lucien's absence 'Tis the work of those Tongue-
</p>
<p>worts. Louisa Tonguewort! For the past week her
</p>
<p>carriage has stood before General Evans mansion.
</p>
<p>She never closes either eye,
</p>
<p>But keeps a watch continually,
</p>
<p>This Argus, hundred-eared,
</p>
<p>Hoping to catch some rumor vile
</p>
<p>Afloat in dreams, or borne on smile,
</p>
<p>Or accents scarcely heard.
</p>
<p>If Mrs. Evans had any character she would not be
</p>
<p>influenced by such a creature. So long as General
</p>
<p>Evans is your friend, and Lucien remains true, why
</p>
<p>need you be disturbed by anything they may say or
</p>
<p>write? You have heard from Lucien, have you not?"

<p>" Sufficient for the death of faith! " said Pearl. If
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 203
</p>
<p>there is more, spare the too trusting ears of Ruby
</p>
<p>Clark. Poor girl !
</p>
<p>Cecile grew faint, believing Pearl delirious.
</p>
<p>"Ah, how long this day is, Cecile."
</p>
<p>"I must insist that you compose your thoughts,"
</p>
<p>said Cecile, " and if you love me "
</p>
<p>"Love you?" said Pearl, "it is only your true heart
</p>
<p>which keeps my faith from breaking with the world.
</p>
<p>But hasten, Cecile, if you love me. First read her
</p>
<p>letter or you'll misjudge mine; then post at once."
</p>
<p>" I never had faith in Lucien, as the son of such a
</p>
<p>weakling mother," said Cecile.
</p>
<p>Pearl closed her eyes and murmured: "And will
</p>
<p>you love me still?"
</p>
<p>" Forever," said Cecile, " I promise you, both for
</p>
<p>myself and Stanley, we will never forsake you. I
</p>
<p>love you, Stanley loves you, and my own true Hugh.
</p>
<p>What a trinity of hearts you may depend upon!"
</p>
<p>" Thank God I'm not alone," said Pearl. " If you
</p>
<p>will read me once again the Prince Imperial's prayer,
</p>
<p>I'll sleep."
</p>
<p>Say not a soul hath lived in vain, who bequeaths to
</p>
<p>the world an invocation to his God like this. Cecile
</p>
<p>read aloud:
</p>
<p>" My God: I give to Thee my heart; but give to me
</p>
<p>faith. Without faith there is no strong prayer, and

</p>
<p>to pray is the longing of my soul. I pray, not that
</p>
<p>204 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>thou shouldst take away obstacles from my path; but
</p>
<p>that thou mayest permit me to overcome them! I pray
</p>
<p>not that thou shouldst disarm my enemies ; but that
</p>
<p>thou shouldst aid me to conquer myself. Hear, O God,
</p>
<p>my prayer. Preserve to my affection those who are
</p>
<p>dear to me. Grant them happy days. If thou only
</p>
<p>givest on this earth a certain sum of joy, take, O God,
</p>
<p>my share, and bestow on the most worthy; and may
</p>
<p>the most worthy be my friends. If thou seekest ven-
</p>
<p>geance upon man, strike me! Misfortune is converted
</p>
<p>into happiness by the sweet thought that those whom
</p>
<p>we love are happy. Happiness is poisoned by the
</p>
<p>bitter thought that while I rejoice, those whom I love
</p>
<p>a thousand times better than myself are suffering.
</p>
<p>For me, O God, no more happiness! Take it from
</p>
<p>my path. I can only find joy in forgetting the past.
</p>
<p>If I forget those who are no more, I shall be forgotten
</p>
<p>in my turn; and how sad the thought which makes
</p>
<p>one say: ' Time effaces all! ' The only satisfaction I
</p>
<p>seek is that which lasts forever; that which is given
</p>
<p>by a tranquil conscience. O, my God' show me ever
</p>
<p>where my duty lies, and give me strength to accom-
</p>
<p>plish it always. Arrived at the term of my life, I
</p>
<p>shall turn my looks fearlessly to the past. Remem-
</p>
<p>brance will not be for me a long remorse. Then I
</p>
<p>shall be happy. Grant, O God, that my heart may

<p>love, and who are dead, shall see all my actions ; that '
</p>
<p>my life shall be worthy of their witness, and my in-
</p>
<p>nermost thoughts shall never make them blush ! ' '
</p>
<p>When Cecile had finished the reading of this inim-
</p>
<p>itable prayer, Pearl closed her eyes, saying: " Cecile,
</p>
<p>you are my sole dependence."
</p>
<p>As for Cecile Veen, she anticipated Pearl had been
</p>
<p>insulted. The proud, indignant girl unfolded Pearl's
</p>
<p>letter and read:
</p>
<p>GENERAL AND MRS. EVANS:

<p>destination, my heart Never before have I questioned

<p>reality into a horrible dream.

<p>position, or justifies me in forgetting I am conversing
</p>
<p>with the father and mother of Lucien Evans; and in

<p>so sheltered by the love of friends that the conscious-
</p>
<p>206 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>ness of my poverty has never confronted me as a re-
</p>
<p>proach. Beyond the loss of the privileges, which
</p>
<p>lend to wealth, its God-ward side, my soul has not
</p>
<p>been creased by coils of poverty. Your pardon, then,
</p>
<p>if I disclaim to be identified with the "audacious
</p>
<p>society flight ' ' referred to in your letter.
</p>
<p>Why should I soar above the humble roof which
</p>
<p>has so amply sheltered me and mine? 'Twas high
</p>
<p>enough to bear my angel mother's spirit up to God,
</p>
<p>and give my father entrance into Heaven. It affects
</p>
<p>neither the airs of the palace nor the degredation of
</p>
<p>the hovel in its modest suggestions that, not by yours,
</p>
<p>but Heaven's consent, I step up higher.
</p>
<p>The spirit of your letter, the close ties of consan-
</p>
<p>guinity, and one's true heirship to ancestral frailties,
</p>
<p>were quite enough to reason love away, but, having
</p>
<p>this day received overtures from your son, pleading
</p>
<p>" his mother's inexorableness and the utter impossi-
</p>
<p>bilities of making public our marriage," I hasten to
</p>
<p>reverse my fate with firm NO ! since on the side of
</p>
<p>principle, there is no room for reasoning further.
</p>
<p>Manhood, chivalry and self-respect lie buried in this
</p>
<p>fatal message; and while I feel most keenly the in*
</p>
<p>dignity perpetrated in the ficticious pictures you have
</p>
<p>drawn of me and my surroundings, I rejoice that my
</p>
<p>life has not made its final compromise with a love so
</p>
<p>unworthy, but that the flowers of a false affection lie
</p>
<p>withered at my feet, revealing the abyss their airy
</p>
<p>nothingness concealed. Yet with this renunciation

<p>of a " rustic pledge," would I be wholly just to one

</p>
<p>whose companionship has embellished so large a
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 207
</p>
<p>portion of my existence. I believe the Lucien Evans
</p>
<p>of the past, and the Lucien Evans of to -day, separate
</p>
<p>entities.
</p>
<p>A young man who could not face domestic opposi-
</p>
<p>tion, meeting with dignified reserve the insolent effron-
</p>
<p>tery of the meddling world, prepared, if need be, to
</p>
<p>withstand an armed universe of frowning faces for
</p>
<p>her he loves, is a fortunate escape to any girl.
</p>
<p>My respect for the father and mother of Lucien
</p>
<p>Evans forbids me to give expression to my feelings
</p>
<p>upon the climax of your heaped indignities, " the sub-
</p>
<p>stantial reward." If Gilead's balm secretes its heal-
</p>
<p>ing powers in gold, fling it to her your choice secures
</p>
<p>in marriage to your son. Neither love, happiness or
</p>
<p>glory are anything to me if purchased at the expense
</p>
<p>of the humblest fellow being.
</p>
<p>For Lucien, I retain but the memory of mutual es-
</p>
<p>teem, and the feeling that, without bitterness, we have
</p>
<p>done our duty. For me, love, and love only as the
</p>
<p>boon for love!

</p>
<p>" Pearl's letter is too kind, if anything; but then
</p>
<p>Pearl has angelic qualities," mused Cecile.
</p>
<p>Somewhere in nature there is a reason for all things;
</p>
<p>but there shall never be any science to explain the
</p>
<p>mysterious workings of the human heart. Yet Pearl

<p>and, though keenly alive to an injury, her indignation

<p>Fate seems to bestow fortune on small natures,
</p>
<p>rather than upon the children of genius; which is in
</p>
<p>accordance with the law of compensation, since the
</p>
<p>former would be nothing in the world without good
</p>
<p>fortune, while the latter, through all sorrow and loss,
</p>
<p>possess the priceless treasures of the ideal world.
</p>
<p>In youth we are so sanguine, we could all but
</p>
<p>fly if we willed. Certainly we can move men and the
</p>
<p>softer rocks. Our heart-strings are harp-strings,
</p>
<p>which vibrate with a magic nothing can resist. We
</p>
<p>have the power of Orpheus; the self-love of Narcissus.
</p>
<p>If we are rebuffed, our self-love sustains us. Later
</p>
<p>on, when dimples lengthen into wrinkles, self-love
</p>
<p>turns to self-pity; rebuffs to disappointments, and
</p>
<p>disappointments to overthrow; losses are irreparable;

<p>griefs are permanent blight.

<p>"The 'winter of my discontent' is over, spring

<p>has come, and the little feathered harbinger which

</p>
<p>token of my gratitude in a velvet carpet of crimson
</p>
<p>leaves the next time his feet alight upon the bare,

</p>
<p>face, it seemed to her the old light had all come back
</p>
<p>to it; only there was more delicacy, more spiritual
</p>
<p>beauty and fervor in the shading.
</p>
<p>" Well, you are a marvel," said Cecile. " I cannot

<p>understand such elasticity of spirits, and can only
</p>
<p>liken it to the sun, moon and stars, suffering them-

<p>selves to be snuffed out now and then, just to take in

<p>a deeper breath of ether and excite anew the wonder

<p>and admiration of every beholder. Oh teach me,

<p>Saul?" she exclaimed, as her eyes caught sight of
</p>
<p>the Tongueworts' carriage rolling by.
</p>
<p>" No," said Pearl abstractedly, " I have barely made
</p>
<p>the rounds of my pupils to-day, without an item of
</p>
<p>news or gossip."
</p>
<p>"Well" continued Cecile, "imagine the most ri-
</p>
<p>-diculous thing in the world, and then imagine some-
</p>
<p>thing ten times as preposterous and ridiculous on top
</p>
<p>of that, and you may approximate the absurd tale
</p>
<p>afloat in St. Saul."
</p>
<p>"You cannot surprise me; so proceed," said Pearl.
</p>
<p>" It is a rumor I give no credence to; nor would I
</p>
<p>repeat it to any other than yourself, out of respect
</p>
<p>to Governor Kellogg. But the society birds are
</p>

</p>
<p>entering the Governor's mansion during his absence
</p>
<p>to give, what she calls ' home-touches ' to the rooms,
</p>
<p>leaving on his bureau choice boquets from her con-
</p>
<p>servatory."
</p>
<p>"How does the Governor relish such exhibitions of
</p>
<p>female gallantry? " enquired Pearl.
</p>
<p>" He greets it with peals of laughter, orders the ser-
</p>
<p>vant to bring the tongs and fling out the flowers, and
</p>
<p>stands swinging the door of his room back and forth
</p>
<p>to fan out the aroma which he declares he is afraid
</p>
<p>will conjure him." *
</p>
<p>Here the girls both laughed.
</p>
<p>" What does Doctor Carlisle think? " asked Pearl.
</p>
<p>"Oh he fairly raves, declaring the slander originated
</p>
<p>in hades."
</p>
<p>" Ah ! What does this mean, my sly little charmer ? "
</p>
<p>exclaimed Cecile, suddenly espying some lilies. "These
</p>
<p>velvet vases are as fresh and dewy as if just plucked
</p>
<p>from the garden of the Gods. Have I discovered
</p>
<p>secrets not intended for me to share, locked in that
</p>
<p>heart which has for years been the sole receptacle of
</p>
<p>mine?"
</p>
<p>Pearl colored to the temples, and tears filled her
</p>
<p>eyes at these earnest, have-reproachful words, spoken
</p>
<p>impulsively.
</p>
<p>"My darling," said Pearl, "you must never distrust

</p>
<p>shared by you. This spray of lilies is as great a
</p>
<p>mystery to me as to yourself, though every day it is
</p>
<p>renewed, and every morning, rise T ever so early, I
</p>
<p>find these floral foundlings fluttering like a tiny flock
</p>
<p>of white-winged birds, upon the outer ledge of my
</p>
<p>street window. They have now become in some occult
</p>
<p>way necessary to my existence. I wear them over my
</p>
<p>heart waking or sleeping, until I have come to dread
</p>
<p>more than any future disappointment, aye, more even
</p>
<p>than death itself, the morning which shall find my
</p>
<p>window ledge bare, and my breathing atmosphere no
</p>
<p>longer bounded in their odorous spell."
</p>
<p>Cecile smiled and said: "In looking at the flowers
</p>
<p>I am convinced they never came from Lucien Evans.
</p>
<p>Their language is expressive of more soul, and a
</p>
<p>higher type of love than he is capable of."
</p>
<p>" Think you I'd wear them if I did not know Lucien
</p>
<p>Evans never culled them?" interrupted Pearl. "At
</p>
<p>first I thought they were his gift, coming as they did
</p>
<p>on the morning of my resurrection from that awful
</p>
<p>sick-bed; and the Scotch blood in me leapt in indig-
</p>
<p>nation to resent the insult. So I wrote upon a slip of
</p>
<p>paper, -leaving it fluttering out of the cluster, these
</p>
<p>words: 'If these lilies are for me, and from L. E., I
</p>
<p>return them with scorn. The sod upon my grave
</p>
<p>fifty years after burial, would shudder them off, P. L.'

<p>The next morning the old bunch with the note at-
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 213
</p>
<p>tached to it was gone, and in its place lay fresh lilies,
</p>
<p>with this poem:"
</p>
<p>TO A LILY.
</p>
<p>Across my path from day to day,
</p>
<p>A lily blossoms, fair as May,
</p>
<p>A pure, white lily, and I asked
</p>
<p>The angel good, who with it passed
</p>
<p>To give the name of this sweet flower,
</p>
<p>And lead me to its love-lit bower.
</p>
<p>The angel came that very night,
</p>
<p>A seraph escort was our light,
</p>
<p>He bore my sorrowing spirit where
</p>
<p>A young life wrestled, dazed with care.
</p>
<p>"There are of whom," the angel said,
</p>
<p>" The world is all unworthy, read
</p>
<p>By the pure eyes of God alone,
</p>
<p>And only to his angels known."
</p>
<p>" To you I give the mystic key,
</p>
<p>Truth, love and honor as you see."
</p>
<p>/V lily blossomed in his hand,
</p>
<p>I reached to pluck it all the land
</p>
<p>Lay white with lilies, but this one
</p>
<p>He held had never seen the sun.
</p>
<p>I knelt to kiss the angel's feet,
</p>
<p>And woke to life and woe complete;
</p>
<p>Yet blest the angel from that hour
</p>
<p>Who named for me my wayside flower,
</p>
<p>And to her shrine, with reverence bring
</p>
<p>These scented feathers from his wing.
</p>
<p>Within their pure aromal charms
</p>
<p>My love holds out its open arms,
</p>
<p>And in the mirror of her eyes

<p>As Cecile held it up before the window she discov-
</p>
<p>ered at the bottom of the page, and beneath the date,
</p>
<p>a very ingeniously wrought monogram. To any but
</p>
<p>Cecile's eyes it might have passed for a little flourish
</p>
<p>of the pen.
</p>
<p>At her discovery Cecile acted like one under the in-
</p>
<p>fluence of ether, flying around the room, clapping her
</p>
<p>hands and dancing. She completely non-plussed her
</p>
<p>friend, who sat staring at her enthusiastic demonstra-
</p>
<p>tions with a more puzzled than amused expression,
</p>
<p>for Pearl was in no mood for a frolic.
</p>
<p>" Well, what is it," said Pearl. " Do you recognize
</p>
<p>the chirography, and have I been the victim of an-
</p>
<p>other deception?"
</p>
<p>"Oh, Pearl! It exceeds my fondest anticipations for
</p>
<p>you !" said Cecile.
</p>
<p>Pearl reached out for the manuscript; but Cecile,
</p>
<p>putting it playfully behind her, said: " No; it is my
</p>
<p>privilege, after having discovered your lover to un-
</p>
<p>mask him for you."
</p>
<p>" You are not at all sure I shall share your enthusi-
</p>
<p>asm. The charm may be broken," said Pearl.
</p>
<p>"Never fear! " said Cecile, "Your lover is one the
</p>
<p>proudest girl might thank her stars to captivate; but
</p>
<p>who has had the sense and penetration to distinguish

<p>Josephine Beauharnais was ordered to prepare for
</p>
<p>the guillotine the night before the morning on which
</p>
<p>the prison doors opened and her feet were set in the
</p>
<p>flower-paths which led to a throne."
</p>
<p>"How long do these mental aberrations usually
</p>
<p>continue with you?" The door was thrown open by
</p>
<p>Aunt Meg, who held up her finger and the interesting
</p>
<p>conversation was cut short.
</p>
<p>Both girls had Hugh Carlisle in their thoughts as
</p>
<p>they caught glimpses of a figure following Aunt Meg.
</p>
<p>Another moment and this illusion was broken, and
</p>
<p>the girls were both locked in the arms of Stanley
</p>
<p>Veen.
</p>
<p>" My precious brother! " said Cecile. "And mine! "
</p>
<p>added Pearl, with tears of joy sparkling on her cheeks.
</p>
<p>" Where did you come from, and when arrive ?" said
</p>
<p>Pearl, leading him to a chair.
</p>
<p>" From the gardens of Mexico; landed at sunset in
</p>
<p>St. Saul. I thought I should find you together.
</p>
<p>Strike a light, dear Pearl, I want to see what the year
</p>
<p>has accomplished with my sisters. Time is a capital
</p>
<p>artist in handling nature. We ought to be able to
</p>
<p>defy him for many years to come.
</p>
<p>Stanley sat silently gazing into the faces of the two
</p>
<p>girls.

<p>between us; your faces, but a night. How I have
</p>
<p>longed to see you. And now that heaven has proved
</p>
<p>itself worthy to be trusted in the care of its own, I
</p>
<p>am ready to go back to my work."
</p>
<p>" Oh Stanley," cried Cecile, "I was in hopes this
</p>
<p>trip would cure you of your quixotism. Why not in-
</p>
<p>augurate social reform right here? "
</p>
<p>" You might as well ask the preachers why they do
</p>
<p>not commence tackling sinners in purgatory," replied
</p>
<p>Stanley. " Why this is the very hot-bed of social de-
</p>
<p>moralization, where every other wealthy man is mar-
</p>
<p>ried to his servant girl."
</p>
<p>"Oh Stanley!" interrupted Cecile, "that reminds
</p>
<p>me of the report about Governor Kellogg."
</p>
<p>" If there are any battles to be fought for him, I
</p>
<p>will enter the arena cheerfully," said Stanley.
</p>
<p>" Well, who do you think is to be the second Mrs.
</p>
<p>Kellogg?" put in Cecile, enjoying the effect of her
</p>
<p>words on her brother's face.
</p>
<p>"I cannot imagine," said Stanley, "no one in this
</p>
<p>saintly (?) vicinage, I trust? "
</p>
<p>"Louisa Tongue wort!" exclaimed Cecile, with a
</p>
<p>twinkle in her eyes.
</p>
<p>"Louisa Tongue wort !" echoed Stanley, <: Louisa
</p>
<p>Tonguewort! Perdition seize the thought."
</p>
<p>The girls laughed.

<p>" Remember," said Pearl, "that love is the only
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 217
</p>
<p>king whose subjects never rebel. When women rebel,
</p>
<p>it is not against love, but against some pretender."
</p>
<p>" True," said Stanley. "Yet Alexander Dumas
</p>
<p>struck at the root of this social upas tree when he de-
</p>
<p>clared friendship to be a nobler sentiment than love.
</p>
<p>' I have observed love attentively ;' he said, ' it disturbs
</p>
<p>the judgment and perverts the conscience. You side
</p>
<p>with the beloved one, right or wrong. What personal
</p>
<p>degredation. I observe, too,' said he, ' that a grand
</p>
<p>passion is a grand misfortune; that victims of it are
</p>
<p>always in a storm of hope, fear, doubt, jealousy, rap-
</p>
<p>ture, rage; and the eud is deceit, or else satiety.
</p>
<p>Friendship is steady and peaceful; not much jealousy;
</p>
<p>no heart burnings. It strengthens with time, and
</p>
<p>survives the small-pox and a wooden leg.' ''
</p>
<p>The girls both refused to endorse this sentiment,
</p>
<p>and Stanley added:
</p>
<p>" I see no cure for you until the fiery ardor of your
</p>
<p>anticipations shall have been quenched in the matri-
</p>
<p>monial knot; until fleshly beauties shall have ceased
</p>
<p>to be considered, and the true color of the soul shall
</p>
<p>have been put to test by the bleaching rains of afflic-
</p>
<p>tion. Then, and then only, is true love proved."
</p>
<p>" Cecile, come. Good night dear Pearl! " The girls
</p>
<p>embraced, and Cecile and Stanley disappeared in the
</p>
<p>darkness. The old, weather-stained door of the cot-

<p>218 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>bed-chamber, yet fragrant with the loved presence of
</p>
<p>her dearest friends. " Surely God hath never forgot-
</p>
<p>ten to be gracious! " she murmered, as she knelt to
</p>
<p>commit herself into the keeping of his angels. "One
</p>
<p>by one, I have suffered my hopes to be trampled into
</p>
<p>the dust; but my heavenly father has never permitted
</p>
<p>the world to take from me these faithful hearts."
</p>
<p>Pearl caught sight of the poem, which had been
</p>
<p>thrown upon her dressing table, and forgotten in the
</p>
<p>greeting of Stanley Veen.
</p>
<p>"Now for the key to Cecile's merriment," thought
</p>
<p>Pearl, as she unfolded the paper, this time holding it
</p>
<p>between herself and the light. Her countenance
</p>
<p>changed, and she was ready to distrust her senses.
</p>
<p>Within the circle of an official seal ( the most delicate
</p>
<p>and phantom-like impression paper could receive)
</p>
<p>were the initials; "C. K."

</p>
<p>marriage of the heavens and earth ; the light which
</p>
<p>pulsates rapturously on soul and sight; these sang the
</p>
<p>words, a perfect day in June. And this day, like
</p>
<p>every other blessing in the world, was going out on
</p>
<p>declining waves of light, through the bars of sunset,
</p>
<p>as Doctor Carlisle passed through a line of maples and
</p>
<p>entered his private grounds. His wife opened the
</p>
<p>the door.
</p>
<p>" Why, what a charming transformation, little wife/'
</p>
<p>said the genial husband. " You must have captured
</p>
<p>several gardens to produce this floral effect."
</p>
<p>" Not a cornice has been slighted " she said, " and
</p>
<p>Hugh's room is a floral bower. Now feast your eyes,
</p>
<p>for this is really the work of fairies."
</p>
<p>The Doctor shaded his eyes.
</p>
<p>" This is artistic," said his wife.
</p>
<p>The life size portrait of Hugh was surrounded with
</p>
<p>flowers and buds.
</p>
<p>Cecile Veen and Pearl LaGrange had assisted in
</p>
<p>the decoration.
</p>
<p>"I can scarcely wait the in-coming train!" ex-
</p>
<p>claimed the happy mother, " and am sorry we did not
</p>
<p>postpone this reception for Hugh until to-morrow

<p>evening.

</p>
<p>vited guests from beholding your laureed graduate
</p>
<p>to-night This honorable degree is rarely conferred
</p>
<p>upon a youth of nineteen. I am proud of him myself;
</p>
<p>but most of our friends will come, I think; as there is
</p>
<p>a grave contingency holding that wedding back to-
</p>
<p>night entre nous: The Governor told me a few even-
</p>
<p>ings ago, that a large sum of money is missing from
</p>
<p>the Clifford Bank, and the teller, young Evans, is held
</p>
<p>accountable. If this sum is not forthcoming before
</p>
<p>the appointed hour, the wedding bells of St. Mark
</p>
<p>will be dumb."
</p>
<p>" Oh this is terrible. I pity Mrs. Evans if Lucieii
</p>
<p>has really been dishonorable," said Mrs. Carlisle.
</p>
<p>" You need not waste any tenderness upon her.
</p>
<p>She is uttterly incapable of feeling."
</p>
<p>But while this peaceful domestic scene is transpir-
</p>
<p>ing, other events are crowding in.

</p>
<p>The vesper bells ceased ringing as Pearl LaGrauge
</p>
<p>repaired to her room to make her toilette, expecting
</p>
<p>Cecile's carriage to call and take her to the reception
</p>
<p>at Doctor Carlisle's.
</p>
<p>A loud rap at the street door startled Pearl from
</p>
<p>her reverie, and, she hastened to answer the summons.

</p>
<p>" La, Miss Pearl, ye aint going to get married, bez
</p>
<p>ye? I said I'd hurt that bad man if I could; and I
</p>
<p>just come over to tell ye how I done it."
</p>
<p>"Why, what have you done?"
</p>
<p>" I mean to say, that Lukin Evans can't get married
</p>
<p>to-night."
</p>
<p>"Nan, tell me quickly what you have done to Mr.
</p>
<p>Evans? "
</p>
<p>" I've settled his hash, you bet," and the girl ran
</p>
<p>her gaunt hand into a pocket and pulled out a package.
</p>
<p>"What is this, Nan?"
</p>
<p>" Money, Miss Pearl. You need'nt tell anybody.
</p>
<p>I took it from Evans on Mercer Street, near Dark
</p>
<p>Alley. He has been coming through there every
</p>
<p>evening, and t'other night he stopped sudden, and
</p>
<p>seemed to be looking for something. A lot of bundles
</p>
<p>fell out of his pocket and I snatched this. I did'nt
</p>
<p>know what it was till I seen it the next day."
</p>
<p>Pearl drew on her black waterproof and placing the
</p>
<p>package in an inside pocket, proceeded with rapid
</p>
<p>steps to the Evans mansion.
</p>
<p>"Can I see General Evans a moment?"
</p>
<p>The General was the soul of courtesy, and would
</p>
<p>sooner have kept a prince waiting, than a beggar at
</p>
<p>his kitchen door. So he hastened to receive the caller.

<p>handing the parcel to the General.
</p>
<p>"It is, it is! Thank God, I know it is! God bless
</p>
<p>you! Oh God bless you! "
</p>
<p>" Examine it please," continued Pearl, " and see
</p>
<p>that the money is all there; otherwise I will see that
</p>
<p>it is replaced."
</p>
<p>" Oh yes," said the General, and taking it to the
</p>
<p>light he carefully went through it.
</p>
<p>Some time was required for this; but Pearl, though
</p>
<p>urged to enter and be seated, remained in the shadow
</p>
<p>of the half closed door.
</p>
<p>Presently the General approached her, saying in
</p>
<p>his happiest tone : " It is all here. Let me reward
</p>
<p>you."
</p>
<p>Pearl started down the steps
</p>
<p>" Here, girl, to whom am I indebted?"
</p>
<p>Pearl turned and said: "To a poor creature on
</p>
<p>Mercer Street, in the Charity Mission School." As
</p>
<p>Pearl said this the door was opened by the General's

<p>CHAPTER XX.
</p>
<p>I am instructed from sweet Heaven to write,
</p>
<p>That soul in error and impaired of sight,
</p>
<p>Who would the memory of love's falsehood soothe
</p>
<p>By falsely swearing "true love ne'er runs smooth."
</p>
<p>First to thyself, O loving heart, be true,
</p>
<p>As streamlet to itself in mirror view,
</p>
<p>Then it must follow, as the sun the sea,
</p>
<p>That true souls only shall be drawn to thee.
</p>
<p>The mystery of Pearl's absenting herself from the
</p>
<p>reception given to young Carlisle was the greatest
</p>
<p>disappointment Cecile had ever experienced, and was
</p>
<p>especially annoying, since it must continue a puzzle
</p>
<p>for the next twenty-four hours.
</p>
<p>On the day following, Hugh Carlisle and Cecile
</p>
<p>Veen visited the LaGrange cottage.
</p>
<p>" You anticipated me, I am not deserving of such
</p>
<p>attentions," said Pearl, holding Cecile's hand.
</p>
<p>" That shall be decided later; and it will take a
</p>
<p>round apology, with no- ragged edges, to satisfy us,"
</p>
<p>rejoined Cecile.

</p>

</p>
<p>" I told you so!" interrupted Cecile, addressing
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>Hugh. " I would have pledged all my possessions,
</p>
<p>save Hugh, that you sacrificed yourself to minister to
</p>
<p>some of those squalid denizens of Mercer Street."
</p>
<p>" It was a most important charity errand, one that
</p>
<p>I could neither postpone, nor delegate to another."
</p>
<p>" And you were right; but how unfortunate these
</p>
<p>episodes of mercy are, which forbid all leisure,
</p>
<p>think you ought to resign your place in the Mission
</p>
<p>School."
</p>
<p>" If it ever interferes with my home duties, I may,"
</p>
<p>said Pearl.
</p>
<p>" Not romantic or poetical either," said Cecile, with
</p>
<p>playful irony. Please explain the light in your win-
</p>
<p>dow, which flashes invariably in the direction of Ter-
</p>
<p>race Hill, and which has certain hours for flaming,
</p>
<p>observed and commented upon by the neighborhood.'*
</p>
<p>Pearl blushed crimson, and answered:
</p>
<p>"Suppose I have a vestal flame burning through
</p>
<p>the dark hours, teing the solitary goddess of my own
</p>
<p>hearthstone; I am privileged to indulge this eccen-
</p>
<p>tricity, am I not? "
</p>
<p>"Aye, and any and all others which commend them-
</p>
<p>selves to your discretion. Never mind Hugh ; I was
</p>
<p>compelled to explain to him the romance of the flow-
</p>
<p>ers which peeped out of Governor Kellogg's vest last
</p>
<p>evening, and which seemed to say to every beholder:

</p>
<p>" Leave something for Pearl to say," said Hugh.
</p>
<p>Pearl touched her cluster of lilies, saying: "Pro-
</p>
<p>ceed. I approve your sentiments."
</p>
<p>"Then," continued Hugt, "Permit me to add what
</p>
<p>occured to my mind when Cecile told me of the Gover-
</p>
<p>nor's devotion to you. Be prepared to be led speedily
</p>
<p>to the altar, for I remember to have heard him say,
</p>
<p>some years ago, regarding marriage, that he was op-
</p>
<p>posed to long engagements ; rather a serious comment
</p>
<p>upon Cecile 's and mine, now nearly twelve months
</p>
<p>old. However, if the Governor's diplomacy in con-
</p>
<p>ducting his love affairs continues to the end, the event
</p>
<p>of his marriage will be like the dashing of a cyclone
</p>
<p>through the heavens at noon-day. Madame Grundy
</p>
<p>will commit suicide by leaping from her stilts, and
</p>
<p>her vain followers stricken dumb with discomfiture,
</p>
<p>will sit down and hate themselves. If Cecile con-
</p>
<p>sent," he continued, " we will double the shock."
</p>
<p>" You forget that Doctor Carlisle is to be shocked
</p>
<p>first, by asking his consent," said Cecile with a smile.
</p>
<p>"Not at all," answered Hugh, "there exists but one
</p>
<p>valid objection to our marriage to-morrow. I think,
</p>
<p>however, I could overcome this. In France, you know,
</p>
<p>one is just as old as one looks; no more, no less; and
</p>
<p>I look twenty-five." Both of the girls laughed heart-
</p>
<p>ily. Hugh continued: "This is my good fortune, and

<p>His powers of endurance must be greater, called upon
</p>
<p>as he is to receive all the parental attention."
</p>
<p>"Were I you, with both time and money at com-
</p>
<p>mand, for the next year or^fcwo I would listen to the
</p>
<p>voice of my genius and stifle that of my heart," said
</p>
<p>Pearl, giving Cecile a look askance.
</p>
<p>" I see a gentleman struggling with the gate," said
</p>
<p>Hugh.
</p>
<p>" O that crazy wicket. It has threatened to put us
</p>
<p>in the street for a year past," said Pearl.
</p>
<p>" Never mind, " replied Hugh, very softly. " It is
</p>
<p>Governor Kellogg; and I prophecy your crazy little
</p>
<p>wicket will shortly be exchanged for a Terrace Hill
</p>
<p>palace gate. Come Cecile ; Pearl will excuse us now,
</p>
<p>as we are some minutes past" due at Col. Veen's."
</p>
<p>" Good-night, and God bless our darling! " said Ce-
</p>
<p>cile, as hand in hand she and Hugh disappeared
</p>
<p>through the rear entrance.
</p>
<p>In another moment Pearl had welcomed the Gover-
</p>
<p>nor, and as Aunt Meg of late occupied her evenings
</p>
<p>in a sleepy-hollow chair at a remote corner of the
</p>
<p>room, until their guest was announced, she only lin-
</p>
<p>gered now to catch the music of Pearl's greeting, and
</p>
<p>then retired, her heart aglow.

<p>" Let us sit out under the tent of stars," said the
</p>
<p>Governor. " Bring your guitar, Pearl, and sing me
</p>
<p>the song I sent you as a substitute for myself the
</p>
<p>evening I failed to come. Have you committed the
</p>
<p>words?"
</p>
<p>" I have," said Pearl, who had made the rendering
</p>
<p>of this piece a faithful study.
</p>
<p>" She is beautiful as a dream ; but I must not tell
</p>
<p>her so," said the Governor mentally, as Pearl returned
</p>
<p>with her guitar, seated herself on the low step at his
</p>
<p>feet and commenced tuning her instrument for the
</p>
<p>song.
</p>
<p>"All this preparatory work to bring the instrument
</p>
<p>into harmony with the song? "said the Governor.
</p>
<p>" It is wonderful the jangling and discordant world
</p>
<p>has never made useful deductions from these art sym-
</p>
<p>bols, with practical illustrations upon the ' Harp of a
</p>
<p>thousand strings,' which is always out of tune. I
</p>
<p>fancy one skilled in the art of coaxing an instrument
</p>
<p>like this out of one mood into another, ought to be
</p>
<p>able to manipulate the chords of the human soul, even
</p>
<p>though unstrung and sadly tensioned, like mine.
</p>
<p>Pearl, dear girl, I cannot go back to Terrace Hill to-
</p>
<p>night without your answer. I have waited now longer
</p>
<p>than my strong love approves." The Governor's

<p>voice trembled and its rich tones rose and fell with

</p>
<p>Sodom had floated suddenly a breath of purer air,
</p>
<p>when into the " wrapt porches " of Pearl's ears caine
</p>
<p>the earnest, never to be forgotten words: "I love
</p>
<p>you, and would devote myself to you forever. Will
</p>
<p>you be mine?"
</p>
<p>The instrument was silent. There was a lull in the
</p>
<p>breeze which a moment before rustled audibly through
</p>
<p>the rich foliage above them.
</p>
<p>"All nature waits with me," said the Governor.
</p>
<p>"Am I to go unblessed, or crowned? I'll wait as long
</p>
<p>as night waits for the morn, but never will I sleep
</p>
<p>the sleep of life and hope again, until you answer me."
</p>
<p>Pearl lifted her eyes to her lover and the tears
</p>
<p>which filled them were her only answer He opened
</p>
<p>his arms. Pearl answered:
</p>
<p>"No, I will sing you my answer."
</p>
<p>The Governor folded his arms, saying:
</p>
<p>" If you sing me No.
</p>
<p>Beware, I'll never go!
</p>
<p>If you sing me Yea,
</p>
<p>I may forever stay.
</p>
<p>So yea, or nay,
</p>
<p>I'm yours alway."
</p>
<p>It was as though the dumb and yearning soul had
</p>
<p>found a voice soft and sweet. The Governor felt

<p>his heart beating faster than the notes which accom-

<p>My hopes lay dead, and life grew'cold,
</p>
<p>I lost the power of feeling,

<p>I shut my heart against the world,

<p>That it might die congealing.

<p>When lo, whit* wings against thejpane

<p>All earthly sounds were fleeting,

<p>Yet I could hear the wheeling stars

<p>The lovely name repeating.

<p>" It is an angel's voice," I said,

<p>Soft odors all my soul caressed,

<p>And in my hands uplifted,

<p>The winds a spray of lilies pressed,

<p>Which through the casement drifted.

<p>I knelt again: " Dear God," I said,

</p>
<p>Must innocence forever suffer wrong
</p>
<p>Because of skulking guilt throughout the land?
</p>
<p>The tortured soul enquires, with outstretched hand
</p>
<p>Toward Heaven: How long, Lord, how long?
</p>
<p>One who witnesses the gathering of the clouds can
</p>
<p>predict the lightning and the storm; so he who knows

</p>
<p>Doctor Carlisle had not been to his office for a week,
</p>
<p>but his slate hung out.
</p>
<p>For the first time in his life, Hugh found matters
</p>
<p>of a confidential nature concealed from him. His
</p>
<p>father and mother had been closeted in the library
</p>
<p>of late, day and night. He felt cut, but resolved to
</p>
<p>suspend his judgment and wait.
</p>
<p>The glory of autumn, that strange poetic period of
</p>
<p>nature's unrest, which thrills the sensitive soul like
</p>
<p>sorrowful melody, was at its height. Mysterious in-
</p>
<p>fluence, exalted by divine poets and pronounced " the
</p>
<p>soul of the world." Whence comes this adoration
</p>
<p>sublime ?
</p>
<p>The evening was far spent, yet the lamps had not
</p>
<p>been lighted at the Carlisle's. The doctor and his
</p>
<p>wife sat by an open casement, a domestic picture mar-
</p>
<p>red only by the sad thoughts which occupied both.

</p>
<p>happy choice," said Doctor Carlisle, "had we remained
</p>
<p>at Stratford, or ' removed to the antipodes. Young
</p>
<p>people find their affinities everywhere, and parents
</p>
<p>cannot keep them from falling in love and getting
</p>
<p>married. You remember the old song with the re-
</p>
<p>frain: ' If my grandmother had died an old maid?' '
</p>
<p>O Louis, if we had only placed the Atlantic between
</p>
<p>us and this awful secret, it could then have been bur-
</p>
<p>ied with us. My dear, good husband, you will kill me
</p>
<p>if you persist in a pursuit of the mystery. The best
</p>
<p>years of our lives have been sacrificed. I entreat you
</p>
<p>to realize we have done our utmost,"
</p>
<p>" Your logic is very bad, little wife. After having
</p>
<p>pursued a worthy object for nearly a quarter of a cen-
</p>
<p>tury, you may rest assured I shall not abandon it, un-
</p>
<p>less overtaken by death. I admit I may have peculiar
</p>
<p>notions to gratify in the premises; but if I live, I shall
</p>
<p>unravel one of the greatest social mysteries ever
</p>
<p>heard of.
</p>
<p>Here the closing of the front gate announced the
</p>
<p>return of their son.
</p>
<p>The doctor arose, throwing the doors of the library
</p>
<p>open.
</p>
<p>"What! All dressed in moonlight?" exclaimed
</p>
<p>Hugh, as he gave his mother a kiss, threw himself at
</p>
<p>her feet and pillowed his head in her lap.

<p>" Capital! In some respects," responded Hugh.
</p>
<p>" In others it clashes with plans I have for the near
</p>
<p>future."
</p>
<p>" Let us hear some of your plans," said his father.
</p>
<p>Hugh quickly responded: "You may recall my
</p>
<p>fruitless attempt to converse with you both regarding
</p>
<p>a matter of personal importance."
</p>
<p>" I shall have to defer this conversation," said the

<p>doctor.
</p>
<p>" Please sir," said the servant, "Col. Veen's coach-
</p>
<p>man has called to see Mr. Hugh."
</p>
<p>"For me!" exclaimed Hugh, leaping to his feet
</p>
<p>" I fear the Colonel is ill. He is depressed of late.
</p>
<p>I infer he has some business trouble too."
</p>
<p>"Little wife," said Doctor Carlisle, lowering his
</p>
<p>voice almost to a whisper as the door closed upon
</p>
<p>Hugh, " I have it all in a nut-shell. Colonel Veen is
</p>
<p>going to pieces financially through the notoriously
</p>
<p>reckless extravagance of his wife. This impending
</p>
<p>catastrophe has, without doubt, suggested to the

<p>Madame the speedy marriage of Cecile to Hugh, as a
</p>
<p>mercenary expedient. While I believe . Col. Veen to

<p>be above such intriguery, I know the vicious influen-

</p>
<p>"Well, what has happened? " said Doctor Carlisle,
</p>
<p>startled by the intense expression of Hugh's counte-
</p>
<p>nance, as he entered the room with an open letter in
</p>
<p>his hand.
</p>
<p>Hugh's voice had a nervous tremor in it, as he an-
</p>
<p>swered:
</p>
<p>" I have a letter from Cecile which will explain to
</p>
<p>you my position.
</p>
<p>"Some months ago, Cecile, Pearl and I made a sol-
</p>
<p>emn pledge to be united in marriage at the same altar
</p>
<p>at the same hour. A remarkable change in Pearl's
</p>
<p>plans brings us suddenly face to face with our oath.
</p>
<p>I will read Cecile's note:
</p>
<p>DEAR HUGH:
</p>
<p>You had but just withdrawn, when a courier
</p>
<p>dashed into our grounds bringing us all to our feet.
</p>
<p>It was a dispatch from Pearl, announcing the depart-
</p>
<p>ure of Governor Kellogg for Washington to-morrow,
</p>
<p>where he will be detained some days. He will not
</p>
<p>consent to leave Pearl behind; in short, Governor
</p>
<p>Kellogg and Pearl LaGrange are to be married at an
</p>
<p>early hour to-morrow, and to take the evening train
</p>
<p>for the federal city. Pearl's superstition is in the as-
</p>
<p>cendancy, even in the presence of this assured happi-
</p>
<p>ness. I will quote a sentence from her note referring
</p>
<p>to us: 'I have explained to the Governor, and he
</p>
<p>bids me defer to you and Hugh before deciding where
</p>
<p>the marriage ceremony shall take place. If we alone

</p>
<p>diction of my mother's picture, I tremble in the
</p>
<p>anticipation of your decision, believing a fatality
</p>
<p>of some kind awaits one or both of us in the event of
</p>
<p>your broken vow.' I do not, nor would I have you,
</p>
<p>share this fear of Pearl's regarding the oath, as this
</p>
<p>presto marriage of hers was not in the bond. If love
</p>
<p>were not so blind a little heathen, Pearl's conscience
</p>
<p>would at once restore to us the liberty of choice. I am
</p>
<p>so agitated that I cannot write; but our answer must
</p>
<p>be speedy. I await your reply, either in person or by
</p>
<p>the bearer.
</p>
<p>Devotedly yours,

<p>CECILE.
</p>
<p>When Hugh looked up from the reading of this
</p>
<p>note, his mother sat with bowed head.
</p>
<p>The doctor rose, took both of the young man's
</p>
<p>hands in his and said:
</p>
<p>"My son, I fear an exuberant imagination has run
</p>
<p>away with your judgment. Your mother and I have
</p>
<p>anticipated this. Tour happiness is as dear to us as
</p>
<p>your life, but to permit you to be hurried out of ro-
</p>
<p>mantic boyhood into the treadmill of married life, with
</p>
<p>cares, trials and responsibilities undreamed of, would
</p>
<p>be the maddest folly. Love, when surrendered to the
</p>
<p>lead of its blind impulses only, is temporary insanity."
</p>
<p>"But my love has been the unfolding of the slow
</p>
<p>bud into the flower; and to-night my manhood's honor
</p>
<p>stands plighted with my marriage vow," replied Hugh,

</p>
<p>" Write what you will. You know my wishes, and

<p>"Nothing, best of sons," said Mrs. Carlisle, stoop-

</p>
<p>a deprecatory gesture to the doctor.
</p>
<p>"I can never marry!" repeated Hugh slowly.
</p>
<p>"Convince my reason then at once, by telling why?"

<p>its own without a deeper reason than that which lies

</p>
<p>Mrs. Carlisle raised her hand entreatingly to her
</p>
<p>husband, but believing his time had come to speak, he
</p>
<p>continued:
</p>
<p>" No better, no more cogent reason could I give, than

<p>Two hours later, after Cecile's suspense had culmi-

<p>the first, the following brief communication from

<p>Hugh, in pencil scrawl:
</p>
<p>MY DEAR CECILE:
</p>
<p>Forgive me for having kept you so long in anxi-

<p>ety. The vow at St. Agnew (that both couples would
</p>
<p>be united at the same time) must be broken, but our

</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXII.
</p>
<p>" Heaven bless the lovely bride! " the morning said,
</p>
<p>As from her rosy couch she raised her head,
</p>
<p>And throwing back the curtains of the night,
</p>
<p>Shook out her shimmering locks of golden light,
</p>
<p>Till from the hills the clear and perfect day
</p>
<p>Through purple depths of cloud-land seemed to say:
</p>
<p>"God bless the bride, and bless him at her side,
</p>
<p>And God's own angels with them both abide."
</p>
<p>The day on which Governor Kellogg and Pearl La-
</p>
<p>Grange were married was exceptionally fair. It was
</p>
<p>as though heaven had said audibly, as she shook out
</p>
<p>her drapery of clouds and turned back their silver
</p>
<p>lining to the sun: "These, my children, have hon-
</p>
<p>ored me in their choice, and are now received into full
</p>
<p>fellowship."
</p>
<p>The wedding, which was celebrated at the La-
</p>
<p>Grange cottage, was conducted quietly, two families
</p>
<p>only being cognizant of the event up to the departure
</p>
<p>of the wedding party. Dr., Mrs. and Hugh Carlisle
</p>
<p>and Cecile Veen were the honored guests. When the
</p>
<p>announcement appeared in the evening, it fell like a
</p>
<p>meteor, kindling gossip, which illuminated St. Saul
</p>
<p>in certain quarters throughout the night.

</p>
<p>238 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>ignorant of Governor Kellogg's matrimonial inten-
</p>
<p>tions.
</p>
<p>While this was a just rebuke to the tongue-wagging
</p>
<p>fraternity, it piqued the Governor's constituents and
</p>
<p>personal friends, and aroused the ire of petty foes,
</p>
<p>who declared a man thus elevated by the people had
</p>
<p>no right to marry unadvisedly, and in making a selec-
</p>
<p>tion from the "obscure class" he had not only grossly
</p>
<p>insulted all " upper- tendom," but snubbed every elig-
</p>
<p>ible candidate for matrimony who claimed social
</p>
<p>equality with him.
</p>
<p>Among the claimants for special consideration, was
</p>
<p>the virgin household of Tonguewort. Time-worn and
</p>
<p>love-lorn, they yet dieted upon a thin variety of de-
</p>
<p>ferred hope which kept them lean.
</p>
<p>To the ambitious Louisa, the news of Cassius Kel-
</p>
<p>logg's marriage was paralizing. Of all her unsuccess-
</p>
<p>ful cap-sets, this brought her the deepest humiliation.
</p>
<p>" This daring escapade! " she said. " This scandal-
</p>
<p>ous innovation upon the established laws of selection.
</p>
<p>Does Governor Kellogg think, because he is scholarly,
</p>
<p>distinguished and courtly, and the most popular man
</p>
<p>in the state, that he can trample upon the customs of
</p>
<p>good society, and force into its circles a girl he has

<p>picked up in the street, whose name has been disgrace-

<p>fully linked with his, and who has beguiled him to

</p>
<p>containing the marriage notice, the infuriated Tongue-
</p>
<p>wort tore it into ribbons, and flinging them from the
</p>
<p>window, she said: "So shall their reputations be rid-
</p>
<p>dled and flung to the four winds of heaven, for I,
</p>
<p>Louisa Tonguewort, have sworn it! "
</p>
<p>One by one the lights went out on Terrace Hill and

<p>the bells rang for midnight It was bright star-light,
</p>
<p>but the long line of shade trees wrapped the empty
</p>
<p>home of the Governor in gloom, portentiously so, en-
</p>
<p>hanced as they were by the light streaming through
</p>
<p>the upper balcony of the Tonguewort ranch opposite.
</p>
<p>Why this brilliant illumination in a bed-chamber,
</p>
<p>where Morpheus was nightly courted and coaxed by
</p>
<p>the combined efforts of a whole pharmacy of nar-
</p>
<p>cotics? Because, " Hell has no fury like a woman
</p>
<p>scorned." Louisa Tonguewort had sworn a terrible
</p>
<p>oath, one that commissioned demons were on guard
</p>
<p>to see that she neither retracted, or delayed to execute.
</p>
<p>For some time she sat in thought. At length the

<p>blooded atrocity and heartless cruelty, could not be

</p>
<p>Jezebel had very naturally become effaced from her
</p>
<p>mind.
</p>
<p>At her morning toilet, Louisa Tonguewort would as
</p>
<p>soon have thought to bring the man in the moon at
</p>
<p>her feet, as to renew her long abandoned correspond-
</p>
<p>ence with Hector Astore. A sudden reversal of the
</p>
<p>wheel of destiny brought her face to face with the
</p>
<p>past, and her old associate in social iniquity, and ren-
</p>
<p>dered vital an immediate resumption of the old con-
</p>
<p>fidence.
</p>
<p>"By heavens! " she muttered through her clenched
</p>
<p>teeth, as she combed back her bristling hair with her
</p>
<p>thin, nervous fingers, " I could curse myself for this
</p>
<p>mental, imbecilic perturbation. Do not the ablest di-

</p>
<p>One week had elapsed since the departure of Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Kellogg and his lovely bride for the national
</p>
<p>capital.
</p>
<p>Cecile Veen had received from Pearl graphic des-
</p>
<p>criptions of the trip and the splendors of Washington
</p>
<p>City.
</p>
<p>The Veen's had just breakfasted when Cecile recog-
</p>
<p>nized the Tonguewort's grand turnout dashing through
</p>
<p>the grounds as though on some life and death errand.
</p>
<p>" O misery, that horrid ogre, Miss Lou Tonguewort,
</p>
<p>is coming, mother. Do let me bar the doors against
</p>
<p>her."
</p>
<p>" You will please mind your own affairs, Cecile,"
</p>
<p>with a cold haughtiness which brought tears to Ce-
</p>
<p>cile's eyes.
</p>
<p>"Mother," said Cecile pleadingly, "do not speak of
</p>
<p>the reception we are to give next week to Pearl and
</p>
<p>the Governor; I pray you do not. I feel you must
</p>
<p>not. Trust to my instinct this time, mother."
</p>
<p>" What do you mean, madcap? Do you imagine Col-
</p>
<p>onel and Mrs. Veen can give a grand reception to the
</p>
<p>out-going and in-coming governors and their ladies,
</p>
<p>without inviting society's Queen? "
</p>
<p>"You do not understand me, mother."
</p>
<p>" I have no time to discuss ethics with you," said
</p>
<p>Mrs. Veen. " I have not lost my head quite," and the

</p>
<p>The ancients recognized three kinds of kisses: The
</p>
<p>"Basiuni," which passed between relatives and friends;
</p>
<p>the "Osculum," which was a mark of respect, and the
</p>
<p>"Suavium," or love kiss, which was the true and bona
</p>
<p>fide kiss. But the kiss which Louisa Tonguewort left
</p>
<p>upon the lips of Mrs. Teen was not one of these; it
</p>
<p>was a cold, clammy collision, and was only equalled
</p>
<p>by the heartlessness of the flabby hand-shake accom-
</p>
<p>panying it.
</p>
<p>"My dear Mrs. Yeen," exclaimed Louisa, "are we
</p>
<p>alone? And can we go into 'executive session,' as
</p>
<p>they say at the capital?"
</p>
<p>Mrs. Veen closed the drawing room doors.
</p>
<p>"Are you sure we are quite alone? Walls have ears,
</p>
<p>you know."
</p>
<p>"At this hour," returned Mrs. Teen, "we are abso-
</p>
<p>lutely abandoned by the world."
</p>
<p>"'Tis well, I have important matters to confer with
</p>
<p>you about. The ladies of St. Mark's are wrought up
</p>
<p>as never before, and to-night hold an indignation
</p>

</p>
<p>consent to the resolutions we shall pass. I have a list
</p>
<p>of names here which I wish to divide with you as one
</p>
<p>of the executive officers of our church." And Miss

<p>which in being released was carried by its weight to

</p>
<p>"Formidable, is it not? It is one of the most
</p>
<p>stupendous social movements that ever agitated a great
</p>
<p>community. You have here just half of the names
</p>
<p>listed, and there is not a name written out upon either
</p>
<p>scroll which may not be found in our church books."
</p>
<p>Mrs. Veen started. " You are surprised, but wait till
</p>
<p>I initiate you into the appalling secrets of Governor
</p>
<p>Kellogg-
</p>
<p>"Governor Kellogg!" interrupted Mrs. Yeen. "In
</p>
<p>the name of heaven, you dare not impugn an act or
</p>
<p>motive of a man the whole state reveres."
</p>
<p>"I dare. The pen of destiny is placed in my hand,

<p>and I will put the final period to his brilliant career.
</p>
<p>In all the gay city there is no other being so conver-
</p>
<p>sant with his history as to be able to throw a deadly
</p>
<p>shaft into his soul's sanctuary. I am, therefore,

<p>selected by heaven to do this work."
</p>
<p>" Did you not at one time indulge some very lively
</p>
<p>hopes in this direction?"
</p>
<p>"Never! Never!" hysterically snapt the spinster,
</p>
<p>clanking her case-knife lips. " I spared the villian
</p>
<p>the humiliation of a refusal, a genuine jilt, which fre-
</p>
<p>quently throws men like him off their balance. This

</p>
<p>" No, no. My dear Miss Lou, you do not mean
</p>
<p>this. Pearl LaGrange I know to have been as well
</p>
<p>bred as any of us."
</p>
<p>" Will you second my efforts in resenting a grand
</p>
<p>insult to society, church and state?" And Miss
</p>
<p>Tongue wort's voice rose with her figure.
</p>
<p>" My dear Miss Lou, I have never refused to in-
</p>
<p>dorse a sentiment or act of yours, either in church or
</p>
<p>society, and never shall. I am fixed in this purpose;
</p>
<p>here's my hand as a pledge."
</p>
<p>A strange light came into the little eyes. Mrs. Veen
</p>
<p>noticed the expression, and could not save herself from
</p>
<p>an involuntary shudder, as Miss Tonguewort added:
</p>
<p>" You will be at my house at sunset. We shall
</p>
<p>have preliminaries to arrange before roll call."
</p>
<p>" I will. But first promise me to be with us at a

<p>Kellogg and his bride. The cards will be out to-mor-

</p>
<p>"Attend the meeting in my parlors to-night," coldly
</p>
<p>replied Miss Tonguewort, " and if the supreme folly
</p>
<p>of tendering a reception to his disloyalty, Governor

<p>" Wait," nervously interposed Mrs. Veen, paling at
</p>
<p>such bitter denunciations.
</p>
<p>" Mrs. Veen," here the voice of Louisa Tongue-
</p>
<p>wort sank to a low growl, " you are provokingly ob-
</p>
<p>tuse to-day. Governor Kellogg has grossly betrayed
</p>
<p>the public, bringing upon himself just contumely.
</p>
<p>He must suffer the consequences. Society is like fire
</p>
<p>and water; one does not want to get on the wrong side
</p>
<p>of it. Governor Kellogg has personally spit upon his
</p>
<p>best friends, you and I in particular." And Miss
</p>
<p>Tonguewort gnashed her teeth. "Are you prepared
</p>
<p>to stand with the church in repudiating the validity of
</p>
<p>such a union, or will you take the off horn of the di-
</p>
<p>lemma, inaugurate a new departure and walk alone? "
</p>
<p>Mrs. Veen hesitated.
</p>
<p>" Mrs. Veen," said the slander-vendor, "Governor

<p>Kellogg and his so-called bride will be to-night os-

</p>
<p>Here the spinal column of the venomous Tongue-

<p>wort weakened from the effects of uttering a falsehood
</p>
<p>so atrocious and hell-born, and she would have leaned

<p>Mrs. Veen soon opened her eyes, but closed them

<p>"As there is nothing more I can do for your mother,"
</p>
<p>said Miss Tonguewort, " I will go."

<p>Mrs. Yeen opened her eyes and said:

<p>Some brows are made to bear a crown of thorns,

<p>Some lives to brave the waves which cradle storms,

<p>And some to make a jest of woe and sadness.

<p>Faith, hope, ambition, love and inspiration,

<p>These crown the individual, make the nation.

<p>the great commercial establishments, the merchants'

<p>St Paul's street connects with St. Peter's before

</p>
<p>The object of Alfred Clifford, was to assist those
</p>
<p>whom the law had forcibly restrained, and to ferret
</p>
<p>out the mystery connected with his own loss of lib-
</p>
<p>erty, now nearly one quarter of a century old.
</p>
<p>" If the messenger returns to me void,' ' said Clif-
</p>
<p>ford musingly, as he read a dispatch from Stratford,
</p>
<p>stating that Vallette would arrive on the evening
</p>
<p>train, "if he returns empty, shall I have courage to
</p>
<p>continue this search further ? ' '
</p>
<p>This train of reasoning was broken by the arrival
</p>
<p>of Vallette in advance of the hour announced. Bound-
</p>
<p>ing into the office he said:
</p>
<p>" Cheer up, old boy ! I have brought the meat in the
</p>
<p>shell this time, and the domestic and obstetric secrets
</p>
<p>of St. Elizabeth's Hospital for twenty-five years back.
</p>
<p>I tell you there is just one chance that a certain wo-
</p>
<p>man, who registered herself as a widow before her ac-
</p>
<p>couchement, is the very party you are in search of; and
</p>
<p>if so you are not only a husband but a father. The
</p>
<p>dates agree with yours, and the description of the lady
</p>
<p>tallies with that given me by the matron. I felt so
</p>
<p>sure I had found your wife and child, that I could not
</p>
<p>master emotions, but jumped out of my chair, clap-
</p>
<p>ping my hands and exclaiming: 'It is the same one

</p>
<p>250 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>"Good God! " interrupted Clifford, "a more thaii
</p>
<p>Soloman's riddle is solved. Helena Clifford and Hec-
</p>
<p>tor Astore are one. In a tiff with one of the sweetest
</p>
<p>girls in New York, I married the young widow of
</p>
<p>Adrian Astore, and Hector was a name I coined my-
</p>
<p>self and gave her, as descriptive of her waspish pro-
</p>
<p>clivities. I postponed getting a divorce on account of
</p>
<p>her delicate condition and the natural appeal to one's
</p>
<p>sympathies of the innocent unborn. So much did I
</p>
<p>fear ante-natal impressions, I exerted myself to humor
</p>
<p>her caprices, making myself a very slave to her mad
</p>
<p>jealousies, and neglecting business to coddle her
</p>
<p>whims, thus guarding the fruit from blight up to
</p>
<p>hour of its maturity. I yearn to know the career of
</p>
<p>this woman and the fate of our child? For the one I
</p>
<p>have only pity; for the other, a part of my being,
</p>
<p>yearnings unspeakably tender. For I believe in hea-
</p>
<p>ven's sweet law of compensations, and in this child I
</p>
<p>may yet find the just reward for unjust suffering."
</p>
<p>Vallette was a Canadian, and a born gentleman at
</p>
<p>heart, and so touched with the pure spirit of the myr-
</p>
<p>tered man before him, his rough hand secretely
</p>
<p>brushed away the gathering tears of sympathy as he
</p>
<p>replied:
</p>
<p>" This is a copy I made from the old matron's reg-
</p>
<p>ister, at the lying-in hospital."

<p>"St. Elizabeth's Hospital,
</p>
<p>Stratford, Ontario, Canada,
</p>
<p>June , 18.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Hector Astore, widow of Adrian Astore, just
</p>
<p>deceased, took refuge in her grief and unfortunate
</p>
<p>condition this evening, for a quiet accouchement;
</p>
<p>dressed like a Sister of Charity, wearing across her
</p>
<p>forehead, a broad white band.
</p>
<p>June 20. Mrs. Astore gave birth to a deformed
</p>
<p>child; shocked the nurse in attendance by thrusting a
</p>
<p>pouch of gold into her hands and beseeching her to
</p>
<p>despatch the child at once for its own sake and hers,
</p>
<p>and shut her lips upon the secret by accepting the
</p>
<p>gold. Next day nurse reported to her patient the
</p>
<p>errand and the woman rallied rapidly. Later on, it
</p>
<p>transpired the nurse wrapped the bit of humanity in
</p>
<p>its rich swaddling cloths, and placing the pouch of
</p>
<p>gold in the package, laid the same on the doorstep of
</p>
<p>one of the hospital surgeons whose wife had just been
</p>
<p>confined, with the loss of her babe. The little stranger
</p>
<p>was made welcome and thus saved from a violent
</p>
<p>death. The woman was afterwards regarded with sus-
</p>
<p>picion, but left as soon as recovered for New York.
</p>
<p>The name of the physician in charge of the Hospi-
</p>
<p>tal at that time was Doctor Sorronto; think he lives
</p>
<p>in the suburb of St. Roch, near the city of Quebec.
</p>
<p>Through him it may be possible to obtain the name
</p>
<p>of the surgeon who adopted the child."

<p>places him so near. Do not look for me till I come,

<p>Fate? Destiny? Or Birth-star?
</p>
<p>Jehovah's plan? Or Adam's sharne?
</p>
<p>It is all one, till death unbar
</p>
<p>The evil door through which it came.
</p>
<p>In Raphael's arabesques, genii spring out of the
</p>
<p>flowers. So the souls of some beings seem to float
</p>
<p>over their exteriors. Hugh Carlisle belonged to this
</p>
<p>order of souls. Such natures are rarely understood.
</p>
<p>It is a mistake to apply force to them. Their eyes
</p>
<p>penetrate mysteries; their thoughts grasp life prob-
</p>
<p>lems. Trust them; there is enough of God in them
</p>
<p>to preserve them from the ways of death. The soft
</p>
<p>belt of heaven's atmosphere is a sufficient moral res-
</p>
<p>traint for them.
</p>
<p>The moment Doctor Carlisle revealed to his son the
</p>
<p>secret which had been locked in his own and his wife's
</p>
<p>breast for over twenty years, that moment Hugh Car-
</p>
<p>lisle was transformed into another being. Had their

<p>and his was unavoidable, and though it shook the
</p>
<p>stronghold of his manhood, his soul wrestled with it
</p>
<p>as the giant oak wrestles with the tempest.
</p>
<p>It was unwise to separate the affianced young peo-
</p>
<p>ple. Not until the reception of Cecile's last letter
</p>
<p>had Hugh Carlisle dreamed of the slumbering forces
</p>
<p>within him. He would act instantly; not at the com-
</p>
<p>mand of, but in consonance with his beloved father.

<p>Having completed arrangements for his departure,

<p>Hugh wrote a letter to Doctor and Mrs. Carlisle,

<p>which is given in advance of posting.

</p>
<p>MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER:
</p>
<p>When this reaches you your son will be
</p>
<p>speeding towards the Golden Gate. Filial love and
</p>
<p>gratitude inspire individual efforts in his own behalf.
</p>
<p>You shall be daily advised as to his movements, and
</p>
<p>their results. That his course may not be deemed ec-
</p>
<p>centric or eratic, he submits the following statements
</p>
<p>and asks for the continuance of your love. Colonel
</p>
<p>Veen's death is imminent. The financial ruin of his
</p>
<p>family will speedily follow. Mrs. Veen is bound ove r
</p>
<p>soul and body to the world and its vanities; and Ce-
</p>
<p>cile, now that she has no longer the strong arm of
</p>
<p>Stanley to lean upon, is helpless. Inaction on my
</p>
<p>part would be unpardonable. The wicked persecution
</p>
<p>of Pearl LaGrange continues. The most infamous

</p>
<p>seems as though the avenging hand of the Almighty
</p>
<p>254 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>must interfere. Can it be possible, as is averred, that
</p>
<p>the first Mrs. Kellogg is the prime instigator in this
</p>
<p>accursed plot for placing Pearl under the ban? You
</p>
<p>say: "What can be done now that this lie has passed
</p>
<p>the lips of the slanderer, and the causes set in opera-
</p>
<p>tion which must go on until their force is spent?"
</p>
<p>I say: stamp out this lie, no matter who gets bruised.
</p>
<p>If mankind find that you have a heart, they will thrust
</p>
<p>a spear into your side, and bathe the wound with vin-
</p>
<p>egar. Can anyone professing Christ persecute a being
</p>
<p>like Pearl, and then look Christ in the face? If I
</p>
<p>have not loved the world, it is for such unchristly
</p>
<p>things. By all that you deem sacred, your love for
</p>
<p>me, and your faith in a destiny commensurate with
</p>
<p>that love, by the hope of our future reunion, by every-
</p>
<p>thing we share together, I adjure you to defend the
</p>
<p>name and character of Pearl LaGrange. I embrace
</p>
<p>you, sweet mother, and should we never meet again,
</p>
<p>I shall honor and cherish you both forever. Farewell.
</p>
<p>Faithfully,
</p>
<p>Your son,
</p>
<p>Hugh Carlisle.
</p>
<p>The moon was setting. The winds seemed breath-
</p>
<p>ing regretful adieus, as though the pains of parting
</p>
<p>grew deep, and then the sorrowful strain wandered
</p>
<p>away into the distance and sank into silence.
</p>
<p>Ah, this was no mere leave-taking. It was the sob-

<p>of enchanted boyhood, which had ended as his work

<p>CHAPTEE XXVI.

<p>If from their altitudes God's angels come
</p>
<p>To see how heaven and earth together move,
</p>
<p>It is with benedictions to the home
</p>
<p>Of bliss domestic, born of weaded love.
</p>
<p>" She has saved the life of my child, and may God
</p>
<p>and his angels desert me if I do not warn her to-night
</p>
<p>of this new scheme for her ruin! " and the eyes of the
</p>
<p>noble looking lady flashed as she gathered her dark
</p>
<p>mantle around her. She has passed out of her home,
</p>
<p>and is treading the streets of St. Saul.
</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. True had recently been added to the
</p>
<p>circles of St. Saul ; but no sooner had their household
</p>
<p>goods been set in order, and the discovery made by
</p>
<p>society that the ex-Governor and his fair lady had
</p>
<p>captivated them and the young people of their family
</p>
<p>with princely hospitalities, and those generous courte-

<p>stranger in a strange land, than they were set upon
</p>
<p>by all the barking dogs of that purgatory of human
</p>
<p>Curdom.
</p>
<p>Entirely new, strange and startling to Mrs. True,
</p>
<p>were the words that saluted her unwilling ears, she
</p>
<p>who was born and bred in good society, and where

<p>the privileges of association were governed by the nat-

</p>
<p>256 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>being " put out of society," than she had of dropping
</p>
<p>bodily out of the world.
</p>
<p>First, came an insulting note from Mrs. Gangrene,
</p>
<p>who felt it incumbent upon her starched ladyship, as
</p>
<p>one of the self-appointed guardians of society, to warn
</p>
<p>Mrs. True, she "being a stranger in St. Saul, etc.,
</p>
<p>etc.," of the penalty for associating with Mrs. ex-Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Kellogg, who was 'under the ban.' "
</p>
<p>At first, the spirit of the lady rebelled against such
</p>
<p>social tyranny; but finding resistance only cost the
</p>
<p>mortification of being openly cut upon the street, and
</p>
<p>suspiciously regarded by her neighbors, the disheart-
</p>
<p>ened Mrs. True surrendered outwardly to the dictum
</p>
<p>of the scandal mongers not, however, till the alarm
</p>
<p>was sounded in her ears by the traitorous lips of the
</p>
<p>ex-Governor's law student who, proving himself no
</p>
<p>better than the fabled serpent, warmed upon the
</p>
<p>hearth-stone of his benefactor, stung them both by
</p>
<p>pronouncing the step a " necessity for the young la-
</p>
<p>dies' sake."
</p>
<p>And now let the reader take a peep with us into this
</p>
<p>ostracised home and family circle, and see this pure
</p>
<p>and lovely being, who is pronounced, with the empha-
</p>
<p>sis of a fish-woman's scream, "under the ban."

</p>
<p>your pillow afterwards, the life of Pearl LaGrange
</p>
<p>had better never have seen the light.
</p>
<p>It is six years since the demon has been supplanted
</p>
<p>by the angel in the home at Terrace Hill. Ex-Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Kellogg now lived the quiet, unassuming life of
</p>
<p>a private gentleman, exalted however for his attain-
</p>
<p>ments, and in the zenith of his professional career as
</p>
<p>a lawyer and statesman; his scholarship comprehend-
</p>
<p>ing an extraordinary knowledge of the works of Shake-
</p>
<p>speare, his popularity none the less, for all the mud
</p>
<p>flung at them both by a woman's hand.
</p>
<p>AVhen Cassius Kellogg married Pearl LaGrange,
</p>
<p>a home of love and happiness with its wealth of quiet
</p>
<p>comfort, which had so long been the dream of his
</p>
<p>soul, was realized. Their marriage was the outward
</p>
<p>symbol only of their perfectly united souls. True
</p>
<p>love and devotion was the fountain upon which it fed,
</p>
<p>and which had for the first time been unsealed in
</p>
<p>their hearts.
</p>
<p>Pearl set her creative brain and busy fingers to the
</p>
<p>work of making a paradise out of a ruin. A fortune
</p>
<p>had been squandered on fashion. It was Pearl's am-
</p>
<p>bition to aid her husband in building another by those
</p>
<p>wonderful reserves of power which seize upon every
</p>
<p>fresh circumstance, as the bee the flower, the sculptor

</p>
<p>upon which to employ the hours. Her reward was to
</p>
<p>see the eyes of the Governor light up with a peculiar
</p>
<p>eloquence, and to hear him declare the every-day
</p>
<p>surprises in the new home to be " like the reading of a
</p>
<p>new page in the Arabian Nights."
</p>
<p>" Wait till the upholsterer sends his bill around to
</p>
<p>your office," Pearl would playfully respond; but the
</p>
<p>bill never put in an appearance.
</p>
<p>The Governor's was a great soul; and a strong
</p>
<p>minded man does not fear to look up to her whom he
</p>
<p>loves. Weak and vain men desire to keep wives on
</p>
<p>their own level, fearing to be surpassed. Woman's
</p>
<p>task is difficult. There is danger in the enervating
</p>
<p>influence of constant intercourse which breathes over
</p>
<p>him, as the moist air over the harp, inducing the
</p>
<p>strings to relax. But in this, as in every other task
</p>
<p>set before her, Pearl excelled other women.
</p>
<p>The summer night was oppressively close, and all
</p>
<p>of the windows and balconies at Terrace Hill were
</p>
<p>thrown open. Ponto, a noble Newfoundland, lay
</p>
<p>struggling with heat upon the porch, looking for all
</p>
<p>the world more like an animated ebony rug, than the
</p>
<p>great, honest-hearted sagacious brute that he was.
</p>
<p>The faithful creature had taken his position where he
</p>
<p>could hear the soft notes of his mistress' voice in con-
</p>
<p>yersation with his master.

<p>night I dreamed of fishing. I was hauling in the

<p>shining denizens in numbers, which with me, you
</p>
<p>know, is an infallible omen of good fortune."
</p>
<p>"Good!" exclaimed Pearl. " I see my darling is a

<p>trifle superstitious, too. Now take back what you said
</p>
<p>when I made a raid upon the peacock feathers, bunches
</p>
<p>of which stared ominously at me from every dark cor-
</p>
<p>ner of this castle, when I came first to Terrace Hill.

<p>Won't you dear? " and Pearl spreading out the palms
</p>
<p>of her husband's hands, laid her face lovingly before
</p>
<p>his gaze, where the light of the moon set it in a
</p>
<p>halo, like the head of a saint.

</p>
<p>" No, dear," said Pearl. "Let us never be rich,
</p>
<p>except as now, in our love for each other. If your
</p>
<p>genius be rewarded with wealth, keep the fact from
</p>
<p>me, unless you take me on its wings out of St. Saul
</p>
<p>forever."

</p>
<p>And though Seraphim thundered the request, and the
</p>
<p>firmament quaked, my resolution would not break.
</p>
<p>Why? Because of my soul's love for you. Would
</p>
<p>you stamp falsehood with the seal of truth, and turn
</p>
<p>this lie loose in pursuit of us, while we, like game, ran
</p>
<p>on before their pack of yelping hounds? No com-
</p>
<p>promise with liars, till heaven's emissaries armed
</p>
<p>with truth overtake them, and they are made to bite
</p>
<p>the dust."
</p>
<p>Pearl never appreciated the nobleness of her hus-
</p>
<p>band, or revered his genius more than at this moment.
</p>
<p>The air was odorous with lilies, and to-night a bunch
</p>
<p>"of tube roses had been added to Pearl's hair. These
</p>
<p>had been tied to Ponto's neck with a note from Mrs.
</p>
<p>True. During that lady's absence, her little child
</p>
<p>had hung out of an upper story window, and was
</p>
<p>about to lose its balance and be dashed upon the
</p>
<p>stone pavement below. At that critical moment Mrs.
</p>
<p>Kellogg's carriage came along. Pearl seeing the child's
</p>
<p>danger alighted, flew up the staircase, seized the lit-
</p>
<p>tle one and bore it in safety to the nurse, kissed it and
</p>
<p>vanished. It was but an isolated instance among
</p>
<p>a multitude of merciful acts this unselfish woman
</p>
<p>was ever conferring upon human beings, and dumb
</p>
<p>brutes.

<p>the position forced upon her. Her nature was impul-

<p>' sive, and her errors were those of the head , rather
</p>
<p>than of the heart. Clearly a victim of circumstances,
</p>
<p>surrounded as by a band of highwaymen demanding
</p>
<p>"unconditional surrender," she yielded, and reflected
</p>
<p>afterwards upon her conduct. One course remained,
</p>
<p>to repent and despise herself. Mrs. True availed her-
</p>
<p>self of this privilege most heartily, though she neither
</p>
<p>lent ears nor voice to the babbling tongues around
</p>
<p>her. Better would it have been for her if she had
</p>
<p>obeyed the voice of her heart. But greater souls than
</p>
<p>hers have made mistakes. Her position was now de-
</p>
<p>plorable. She was misunderstood and slandered by
</p>
<p>society people who angled for the ex-Governor's smiles,
</p>
<p>while playing the traitor and traducer to his wife.
</p>
<p>Among these whited sepulchres was the new Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor and his lady, who privately dined at the ex-
</p>
<p>Governor's, and afterwards boasted of having taken
</p>
<p>"a close carriage with curtains drawn in going to
</p>
<p>and from the Kellogg mansion."
</p>
<p>The tall lady in the mantle was no other than Mrs.
</p>
<p>True, who, approaching the front entrance to the Kel-
</p>
<p>logg mansion, opened the gate, and tying her handker-
</p>
<p>chief around Ponto's neck, stood awaiting the result
</p>
<p>of her stratagem. Strands of her daughter's long

<p>the dog trotted majestically into the house and up to
</p>
<p>his mistress.
</p>
<p>Supposing some one of the True family was hover-
</p>
<p>ing about the premises, Mrs. Kellogg framed an ex-
</p>
<p>cuse, and followed Ponto to her friend.
</p>
<p>"For the love of heaven," said Mrs. True, "what
</p>
<p>does Governor Kellogg mean by allowing your por-
</p>
<p>trait to hang over the bar of a tippling saloon? "
</p>
<p>" My portrait? " said Mrs. Kellogg. "I never had
</p>
<p>one painted in my life. Who has seen it?"
</p>
<p>" Everybody. That is, every gentleman in St. Saul,
</p>
<p>and a number of ladies have been taken by their hus-
</p>
<p>bands to look at it. It is beautifully executed. None
</p>
<p>but on artist could have worked up the details; and
</p>
<p>all pronounce the likeness accurate. The shoulders
</p>
<p>are bare and just a hint of the fine bust below softly
</p>
<p>swells the airy folds of drapery, and then it fades away
</p>
<p>in clouds. Surely, surely Governor Kellogg has heard
</p>
<p>of it?"
</p>
<p>" Surely Governor Kellogg has not heard of it.
</p>
<p>The town would not contain the volume of his wrath,
</p>
<p>if he had," said Mrs. Kellogg.
</p>
<p>"The Governor is at home, I presume 9 " inquired
</p>
<p>Mrs. True.
</p>
<p>"The Governor is always at home, after office
</p>
<p>hours," laconically responded Mrs. Kellogg.

<p>deserts. But some day, Mrs. Kellogg, lie shall know
</p>
<p>my course of action was not false in any sense. I am
</p>
<p>no Judas, and Peter was forgiven, you know; and I
</p>
<p>shall be perhaps not now, nor here but it will come
</p>
<p>as surely as God's angels answer prayer. I'll wring
</p>
<p>forgiveness from his heart, though it may be a flower
</p>
<p>dropped from his hand upon my grave. But heed
</p>
<p>me; my errand is not selfish. I came expressly for
</p>
<p>your sake. The Governor surely errs in dealing with
</p>
<p>these people in such a lofty way. Were they his
</p>
<p>equals socially, silent contempt would long ago have
</p>
<p>shut their mouths and proved you as you are, both
</p>
<p>white and innocent; but meaner souls are flattered by
</p>
<p>it and claim to have shut the door of social intercourse

</p>
<p>night, a full blaze burning in its face, for every rounder
</p>
<p>to sling his smut at"
</p>
<p>" Yes, I see," said Mrs. Kellogg. " The locality of
</p>
<p>the picture is what has suggested this stupendous fab-
</p>
<p>rication. Here it is in epitome: a woman's picture;
</p>
<p>a saloon. That's quite a fruitful subject with the at-
</p>
<p>tachment of my name, since their favorite appellation
</p>
<p>for me is ' the drunkard's daughter,' you know," and
</p>
<p>Mrs. Kellogg gave an amiable little laugh.

<p>rather cavalierly.

<p>" Then, please tell him instantly," said Mrs. True.
</p>
<p>" Here is the address of the saloon keeper, where the
</p>
<p>portrait hangs this moment in a blaze of light over
</p>
<p>the name of Pearl LaGrange. I go."
</p>
<p>Both ladies moved quickly in opposite directions,
</p>
<p>and both were intensely thoughtful. One, glad in her
</p>
<p>heart that her errand had been executed well; the
</p>
<p>other with a sense of injured innocence.

<p>man fell to the floor of the saloon.
</p>

</p>
<p>The next moment a gentleman of commanding
</p>
<p>appearance stepped forward, waved the roughs back,
</p>
<p>and said:
</p>
<p>" If a mad dog passes along your streets, snapping
</p>
<p>at all who come in his path, the man who shoots him
</p>
<p>down is a public benefactor, he has saved precious
</p>
<p>lives. But when a human cur circulates your thorough-
</p>
<p>fares, his lips saturated with the poison of slander,
</p>
<p>his tongue a two-edged sword, wounding the helpless
</p>
<p>beings in his path, slaying character recklessly, you
</p>
<p>toast and cheer him, and the man who strikes him
</p>
<p>down you call a murderer! "
</p>
<p>Here some one in the crowd called out, " Give us a
</p>
<p>rest, and give the preacher a drink."
</p>
<p>The stranger turning to the saloon keeper said:
</p>
<p>" You will oblige me by taking down the lady's por-
</p>
<p>trait at once. I have defended her name, and I de-
</p>
<p>mand possession of this picture."
</p>
<p>" Ha ! So the lady has a defender ? "
</p>
<p>" Be careful sir ! I've one arm left, and it will not
</p>
<p>be spared in the defence of purity!"
</p>
<p>The saloon keeper cowered before the determined
</p>
<p>gaze fixed upon him, and said:
</p>
<p>" Don't be touchy; I meant no harm. What aston-
</p>
<p>ished me was to see young Evans, the crack shot tum-
</p>

</p>
<p>got sand. How much will you ask to knock out that
</p>
<p>dude again? I see he's come to."
</p>
<p>"I am not a bully sir, and that was a most cowardly
</p>
<p>assault he made upon me. However the wound car-
</p>
<p>ries no shame with it," and the stranger, lifting his
</p>
<p>arm slowly and with pain, revealed to the amazement
</p>
<p>of all, a sleeve full of blood.
</p>
<p>" Well I'll be d d! " said the saloon man, " if he
</p>
<p>didn't try the carving act on you. How much of that
</p>
<p>Indian war paint can you spare? You don't look very
</p>
<p>blushing around the gills."
</p>
<p>"See here," broke in the stranger, "just knot this
</p>
<p>handkerchief where I have wound it; tight, please;
</p>
<p>and give me the picture. After I've seen a surgeon I
</p>
<p>will settle with you."
</p>
<p>" I can't do it, boss. The artist who painted that
</p>
<p>picture is in need of her money, and unless you are
</p>
<p>flush, you cannot get the picture. Besides a case of

<p>jewels goes with the little lady." And the gin mill
</p>
<p>keeper held up a plush casket, the uniqueness of
</p>
<p>which struck the gentleman as familiar, yet he could
</p>
<p>not recall the circumstances which left the impression
</p>
<p>upon his memory.
</p>
<p>" How did you get those jewels? " said he. " They

</p>

</p>
<p>"She has sinned then, has she? Ha! ha! I
</p>
<p>thought so. Here boss, take a drink with me. "
</p>
<p>" I've no time to chaffer with you. Surrender the
</p>
<p>picture; I will settle with you to-morrow. Here is
</p>
<p>my name and address." The gentleman looked faint.
</p>
<p>"Wait a bit." said the rum seller. " Here comes
</p>
<p>Governor Kellogg. I'll have a high bid now, as sure
</p>
<p>as black cats bring money."
</p>
<p>The stranger dropped into a wooden settle, lean-
</p>
<p>ing his head against the bar, saying: "Thank God!"
</p>
<p>and closed his eyes.
</p>
<p>At this juncture there was a general stampede for
</p>
<p>the door, and the saloon was emptied of its surplus
</p>
<p>human filth.
</p>
<p>Governor Kellogg, apparently oblivious to his sur
</p>
<p>roundings, walked rapidly towards the picture, upon
</p>
<p>which his eyes were fastened with an expression of
</p>
<p>intense eagerness.
</p>
<p>"A fine evening, Governor," said the saloon keeper,
</p>
<p>with purring suavity.
</p>
<p>" I believe you have on exhibition here a portrait
</p>
<p>painted by my sister, which was carried off with the
</p>
<p>entire lining of my house, years ago. Let me assist

</p>
<p>268 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>" Yes," said Governor Kellogg, after a careful ex-
</p>
<p>amination of the painting, " here are my sister's ini-
</p>
<p>tials."
</p>
<p>" I see," and as the painter is a poor relation of
</p>
<p>yours, you wont mind taking brilliants and all, will
</p>
<p>you?" and the box of jewels was flung upon the
</p>
<p>counter.
</p>
<p>"How came this casket in your possession? "
</p>
<p>"Why, from the painter herself your sister! "
</p>
<p>" Hell's sister! And this is the Devil's conscience-
</p>
<p>fund!" said the Governor; and he placed his hand
</p>
<p>to his forehead. " Wrap them up with the portrait."
</p>
<p>" Not so fast, young fella. I have promised the
</p>
<p>painter that this lady and her jewels shall not go till
</p>
<p>the ' dust ' is laid down."
</p>
<p>" I prefer peace to war, but having come here to
</p>
<p>reclaim stolen property, this portrait will go out with
</p>
<p>me, if I have to walk over dead bodies." Here a deep
</p>
<p>groan startled both.
</p>
<p>" I forgot that young man. I guess he's croaked."
</p>
<p>He raised the head of the wounded man, just as the
</p>
<p>Governor looked around.
</p>
<p>" Stanley Yeen! Murdered! " said the Governor, as
</p>
<p>he collared the saloon keeper, "who has done this

<p>recounted the altercation had over the portrait
</p>
<p>which resulted in the shot and secret stab, while he
</p>
<p>enlarged upon the plucky spirit displayed by the
</p>
<p>wounded man.
</p>
<p>There was an awful earnestness in the face of the
</p>
<p>Governor during the preparations for moving Stanley
</p>
<p>to his home, which awed the brute nature he was
</p>
<p>dealing with into a dogged silence. When he saw the
</p>
<p>portrait and jewels moving out, he did venture to ex-
</p>
<p>postulate.
</p>
<p>" Send your confederate in this villainous business
</p>
<p>to me. I'll settle the bill," and the horses were lashed
</p>
<p>into impetuous speed towards Terrace Hill.
</p>
<p>An hour later, and Stanley Veen's head was resting
</p>
<p>under the hospitable roof of his dearest earthly friends.
</p>
<p>As the morning light was breaking, Pearl approached
</p>
<p>and gazed on the fine face, which still bore traces of
</p>
<p>the storm that had swept over it the night before.
</p>
<p>" For me," she said, tenderly kissing the pale hands.
</p>
<p>" For us, love," said the Governor. " It will be re-
</p>
<p>markable if he recovers."
</p>
<p>There was a long pause. Then said Pearl:
</p>
<p>" If Stanley should go away so early, what a tragic
</p>
<p>solemnity his history would wear. So good, so loved,
</p>
<p>and yet unappreciated. Departing without the laurel-
</p>
<p>crown which he has won."

<p>It has been said of woman, when given over to a
</p>
<p>reprobate life, that she plunges "cross-lots" to Hell.
</p>
<p>The illustrious Hector was by no means an excep-
</p>
<p>tion to the rule.
</p>
<p>When night pitched her tent of darkness, another
</p>
<p>shadow, tall, thin and malignant, glided along the
</p>
<p>familiar paths of Terrace Hill.
</p>
<p>Attired in black, with a scowl drawn over her face,
</p>
<p>she approached so near the persons of Pearl and her
</p>
<p>husband as to breathe the very atmosphere of their
</p>
<p>words, causing her to be tortured by the demon Jea-
</p>
<p>lousy.
</p>
<p>At such perilous hours, Pearl, unconsciously to her-
</p>
<p>self, deterred the wretch from accomplishing her
</p>
<p>terrible wishes; just as lives are guarded by guardian
</p>
<p>angels.
</p>
<p>In the garden, on the terrace or shaded lawn, where-
</p>
<p>ever this menacing horror shadowed her, Pearl in-
</p>
<p>stinctively shuddered, and for that night, at least, the
</p>
<p>frolic was over, and the house put on the defensive
</p>
<p>against house-breakers.

<p>to her niche of prayer. There only could she be seen
</p>
<p>unaccompanied by her husband; and there alone
</p>
<p>the observed of all observers she bowed low her
</p>
<p>beautiful head among her revilers, persecutors and
</p>
<p>slanderers; and there her enemies armed them-
</p>
<p>selves anew against her, while kneeling beside her at
</p>
<p>the Lord's table, where we are warned of the spirit in
</p>
<p>which we partake of the sacred emblems of Christ's
</p>
<p>body and blood, either "worthily, or to our damnation."

<p>When their Christian (?) spite lapsed into apathy,
</p>
<p>Hector Astore returned to St. Saul and renewed the
</p>
<p>fire under her witch-cauldron with "the story of the
</p>
<p>portrait," a libel unmatched since the story of the
</p>
<p>necklace in the sad life of Marie Antoinette.
</p>
<p>A profound sensation was created when the Rector

<p>read the following letter of resignation from Mrs.

<p>last, but by no means least in the mercenary judg-

<p>conscientiously called upon to sever this relation for-

</p>
<p>ever, inasmuch as my work is no longer crowned with
</p>
<p>God's blessing, I wish to set forth " with charity for
</p>
<p>all and malice toward none " my sincere reasons for
</p>
<p>so doing.
</p>
<p>My prayer to God has ever been that I might be
</p>
<p>shown the "beam in my own eye," before being able
</p>
<p>to discover "the mote in the eye of my brother," and
</p>
<p>charitably, and lovingly and mercifully to judge all
</p>
<p>men, knowing that all that is mortal is fallible and
</p>
<p>sinful, and that there are neither better nor worse
</p>
<p>people within than without the churches, but that all
</p>
<p>are the children of God and alike responsible to him
</p>
<p>according to their light, or the number of talents com-
</p>
<p>mitted to their trust. That the spirit of love is the
</p>
<p>only spirit to exercise in the dealing, one with another,
</p>
<p>either in the church, or among the world's people.
</p>
<p>That I have observed with deep sorrow of heart the
</p>
<p>rapid evolution of this church from the Lord's vine-
</p>
<p>yard into the Devil's workshop! That I have only
</p>
<p>commiseration for those who have suffered this un-
</p>
<p>holy outrage and joined hands and tongues with those
</p>
<p>who have perpetrated and sanctioned its commission.
</p>
<p>For years the sorrow has been secretly laid before
</p>
<p>God in fervent prayer and burning ecstacy of faith,
</p>
<p>that He would pour out his spirit of love upon this
</p>
<p>people and show them the enormity of their wicked-
</p>
<p>ness, but as in the days of Pharoah, the people seemed
</p>
<p>to harden their hearts more and more, and the blessing
</p>
<p>to be deferred by Divine displeasure. I then individ-
</p>
<p>ualized my work. I drew up a writing upon which I

</p>
<p>desired the ladies of the church to act by appending
</p>
<p>274 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>their own signatures thereto. The writing read as
</p>
<p>follows: "We, the undersigned, having witnessed for
</p>
<p>a term of years the world's scandalous persecution
</p>
<p>of our young sister in the church Mrs. Pearl La
</p>
<p>Grange Kellogg noting in all these years the Christly
</p>
<p>spirit she has displayed towards her enemies, the con-
</p>
<p>sistency of her church walk, her social and domestic
</p>
<p>virtues, do believe she has been most grossly and
</p>
<p>cruelly wronged, and propose henceforth to call upon
</p>
<p>her, and take her into full fellowship, in public and
</p>
<p>private, and God helping us, to frown down slander,
</p>
<p>the moral and social leper infecting the society of St.
</p>
<p>Saul, from this hour, henceforth and f orevermore ! "
</p>
<p>That I gave my personal attention and time entirely
</p>
<p>to this matter through the working hours of many days,
</p>
<p>carrying the same before my God in prayer at night,
</p>
<p>for His blessing; interviewing every lady member,
</p>
<p>from the Pastor's down to the Sexton's wife, without
</p>
<p>as you know, obtaining one signature! And that I
</p>
<p>denounce such a church of God as "A whited se-
</p>
<p>pulchre, which, indeed, appeareth beautiful outwardly,
</p>
<p>but within is full of dead men's bones, and of all un-
</p>
<p>cleanness," and that I leave them with the words of
</p>
<p>the Saviour, in Mathew 23 33, as pronounced by Him
</p>
<p>against this and all other great shams erected in His
</p>
<p>name.

<p>CHAPTEE XXIX.
</p>
<p>The mystic warnings in the loom of fate,
</p>
<p>The baffling snarls, the worn and knotted thread
</p>
<p>Patience, O soul! The hour is not too late,
</p>
<p>Love lives. And hope, fair hope, is not yet dead.
</p>
<p>The sun had made the golden circle of the day, and
</p>
<p>strata of gorgeous clouds massed themselves along the
</p>
<p>western horizon.
</p>
<p>The winds were still, and the river basked in the
</p>
<p>brilliant reflections of the dying day.
</p>
<p>The elegant world had finished its evening toilet,
</p>
<p>and was ready to see and to be seen, to hear and be
</p>
<p>heard, to shine and behold, all smiling and gay, the
</p>
<p>crowds of careless souls sauntering in slip-shod ease
</p>
<p>through the flowery vistas of Circle Park.
</p>
<p>Therewas a fresh sensation in St. Saul. A mon-
</p>
<p>ster, had suddenly risen out of a sea of flowers. Tak-
</p>
<p>ing up its position in the public park, it challenged
</p>
<p>alike the stupid and the wiseacres, until curiosity
</p>
<p>reached a high pitch.
</p>
<p>Old men shook their heads and cried, "Lunatic! "
</p>
<p>and young men dismissed the puzzle with similar ep-
</p>
<p>ithets directed at its projector, Doctor Carlisle, who
</p>
<p>was supposed to have been crazed by the unfilial con-
</p>
<p>duct of his only son, who fan away from college, jilted

<p>heard of in six years. This and many other false
</p>
<p>stories were circulated in connection with the oriental
</p>
<p>image.
</p>
<p>Doctor Carlisle having retired from practice, was
</p>
<p>rarely to be met in public; and was branded in society
</p>
<p>as "cranky." Both he and his wife had dropped out
</p>
<p>of the social world.
</p>
<p>Now their names were upon every lip, and the doc-
</p>
<p>tor was besieged day and night by newspaper repor-
</p>
<p>ters, but he declined to be interviewed, referring curi-
</p>
<p>ous people to the following, announced by the Sphinx:

<p>but thirty days of suspense before the sanity or in-
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 277
</p>
<p>sanity of Doctor Louis Carlisle would be established.
</p>
<p>No preparations were visible beyond the selling of
</p>
<p>the tickets, which were rapidly disposed of the capacity
</p>
<p>of the building alone limiting the number.
</p>
<p>To the long-tongued Louisa, Doctor Carlisle owed
</p>
<p>much of his daily increasing fame as "an accomplished
</p>
<p>wizard, erudite in witch-craft." He was expected to
</p>
<p>give not only the dramatic phases of stage-struck
</p>
<p>lunacy, but to perform " feats of jugglery known only
</p>
<p>to the Canadian conjuror." The extravaganza would
</p>
<p>include a bird's eye view of Stanley Veen's Utopia,
</p>
<p>mounted on the spine of a lonely cactus springing
</p>
<p>from the jaws of a cave overlooking the verdureless
</p>
<p>shores of Olmira Bay also a touching picture of "the
</p>
<p>prodigal son, feeding on husks in a foreign land to
</p>
<p>gratify an inherited mania for travel, while his father's
</p>
<p>unlimited wealth enabled him to run a private lunatic
</p>
<p>asylum in the home for himself and stricken wife,
</p>
<p>and to people the stage with animated vagaries for
</p>
<p>the amusement of a community thus tolerant of lunacy
</p>
<p>and liberty." As for herself she had "rather miss
</p>
<p>attending her own wedding than fail to witness the
</p>
<p>debut of the gifted lune," hearty laughter representing
</p>
<p>to the spinster much additional adipose tissue for her
</p>
<p>scrawny anatomy.
</p>
<p>So the condescending Louisa, since the credentials

</p>
<p>engaged a private box (a pew) near the stage, and for
</p>
<p>her guest's sake, facing the one to be occupied by ex-
</p>
<p>Governor Kellogg and his lady.
</p>
<p>Miss Tonguewort had given out to her intimates
</p>
<p>who were careful to spread the news, that her circle of
</p>
<p>virgins would be sandwiched upon this occason by a
</p>
<p>lady friend from San Diego, " the traveled and cul-
</p>
<p>tured widow of the late Col. Astore."
</p>
<p>It was not suspected that the guest was the once
</p>
<p>honored mistress of Terrace Hill.
</p>
<p>The "Widow Astore" paid little attention to the all-
</p>
<p>absorbing theme furnished by the announcement of
</p>
<p>the forthcoming play, but busied herself in secret
</p>
<p>concoctions for dealing a complete and final blow to
</p>
<p>"the rivals of her watch."
</p>
<p>Had the ghost of her past life arisen before this
</p>
<p>unhappy woman and revealed to her that in the ren-
</p>
<p>dition of "The Mystery" her lethargic conscience,
</p>
<p>yet capable of one more death-throe, would be awak-
</p>
<p>ened; that the pit she had dug for another was about
</p>
<p>to open at her feet; such was her inward sense of
</p>
<p>guilt, and such her moral cowardice she would have
</p>
<p>met death speedily at her own, hands.
</p>
<p>"Hearts of Oak" was upon the boards at St. Saul,
</p>
<p>and the Park was soon deserted by the fashionable
</p>
<p>citizens for the Opera House.

<p>the foot of the grand entrance, remarked to the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor:
</p>
<p>"I have been in quest of you all day. Did you suc-
</p>
<p>ceed in rinding the Durant affidavit? "
</p>
<p>"I did; but it was owing to the good memory of my
</p>
<p>wife," said the Governor. The incident at the time
</p>
<p>impressed me, but was erased from my memory. I
</p>
<p>should not have recognized the paper but for Pearl.
</p>
<p>I will see that you have it at an early hour to-mor-
</p>
<p>row."
</p>
<p>" That will do. I am obliged to you both. Good
</p>
<p>night! " and the Doctor hurried home.
</p>
<p>I said home. The name had been a misnomer since
</p>
<p>Hugh's departure.
</p>
<p>" What if he returns again to-night, without news?"
</p>
<p>said the doctor's wife, shuddering to think what a
</p>
<p>shadow she had made of herself grieving for the loss
</p>
<p>of that presence which, from the cradle, had been to
</p>
<p>her a consolation. " Who comes? Those footsteps
</p>
<p>are too quick, too light to bear a heart of lead, and
</p>
<p>there is no good news in all the world, unless it comes
</p>
<p>from Hugh!" said she, meeting her husband at the
</p>
<p>door.
</p>
<p>"Ah, little wife," said he, throwing both arms
</p>
<p>around her, " this sitting up so late will never do.

</p>
<p>at least for the next thirty days," and the genial hus-
</p>
<p>band drew a letter from his pocket and tapped his
</p>
<p>wife's cheek with it.
</p>
<p>"O Louis! A letter? And it is from our darling?
</p>
<p>Tell me, does he live? My blessed Hugh? "
</p>
<p>" Live," laughed the Doctor. " His life is more a
</p>
<p>reality than yours or mine, for he has youth; and if
</p>
<p>I have not lost the gift of prophecy, his life will soon
</p>
<p>take on new attributes.
</p>
<p>Doctor Carlisle tenderly laid her upon the sofa, and
</p>
<p>proceeded to read the letter:
</p>
<p>Iturbide Hotel, Mexico City, Sept. 20, 18 .
</p>
<p>My Dear Parents :
</p>
<p>Seven years have brought many experiences.
</p>
<p>It was an evening in September; myself and com-
</p>
<p>panion came on horseback, at the close of a beautiful
</p>
<p>twilight, upon some Indian fishers encamped among
</p>
<p>the bushes on the west shore of Olmira Bay. Some
</p>
<p>giant Pitahallas stood near by.
</p>
<p>Under one of these we unsaddled. A fire of dried
</p>
<p>cactus was blazing. It marked and lighted the en-
</p>
<p>campment. Three or more dogs, a goat or two, some
</p>
<p>sheep, two women, a large boy and several children,
</p>
<p>made the group "at home."
</p>
<p>The dogs growled. Nothing else apparently noticed
</p>
<p>our arrival. Nothing was said to us; we said nothing
</p>
<p>to anything. Fish were hanging from the Mesquite

<p>trees. The flesh of the green sea turtle, cut in strips,
</p>

</p>
<p>was dangling from the arms of Hechos.* Many shells
</p>
<p>of the turtle were lying around. Some served for
</p>
<p>seats; others held salt and fish and one was used for
</p>
<p>a cradle.
</p>
<p>We were tired. "Within a few minutes we were
</p>
<p>stretched in our blankets in front of and near to the
</p>
<p>fire. The burning fagots were company. They
</p>
<p>cheered us. The temperature, after sun down, on
</p>
<p>this shore is cool even in summer. It was a quaint
</p>
<p>and novel experience this, my first evening at Olmira.
</p>
<p>The mute indifference of those Indian fishers made
</p>
<p>a deep impression. I shudder in recalling their
</p>
<p>silence. They moved from fire to bush, from shell into
</p>
<p>darkness, stepping over or near, but never noticing us.
</p>
<p>Did we to them actually exist? Could it be that we
</p>
<p>were invisible? Were we no more than shadows?
</p>
<p>I watched the toads as they hopped close to the fire
</p>
<p>to catch the insects which, by venturing too near the
</p>
<p>flames, burned their wings and fell helpless victims at
</p>
<p>the edge. The toads, the insects, the animals, the
</p>
<p>Indians, the fire, the giant cacti, the beautiful mes-
</p>
<p>quites and the stars over all I see them now as then,
</p>
<p>a wierd and mottled grouping a primeval pastoral
</p>
<p>scene, sketched in the light and shadow, amidst the
</p>
<p>flame and smoke of a camp fire, at dusk in Sinaloa,
</p>
<p>Mexico.
</p>
<p>These Indians were Mayos. They are a tall, ath-
</p>
<p>letic race. Their pueblos are mostly in the valley of
</p>
<p>the Kio Mayo, in Sonora to the north. They keep

<p>intact their tribal, community life; hold their lands

</p>
<p>cultural pursuits. Those who wander away from their
</p>
<p>villages do chores for the Mexicans of the Eio Fuerte
</p>
<p>and Eio Sinaloa valleys, or work in the mines of the
</p>
<p>Sierra Madre, directly east.
</p>
<p>The language of the Mayos is the Maya. This was
</p>
<p>that of the great Mazapan nation which, in prehistoric
</p>
<p>times, filled Yucatan, Campeche, Oaxaca and Chiapas
</p>
<p>with cities larger and stronger than any of modern
</p>
<p>times in Europe or elsewhere.
</p>
<p>What were the attractions to encourage the diversi-
</p>
<p>fication of home industries necessary to build and
</p>
<p>adorn and furnish such vast and solid cities like Aske,
</p>
<p>Uxmeal, Mitla and Palamque? What were the injus-
</p>
<p>tices practiced by those in power, which eventually
</p>
<p>bemeaned, degraded and enraged the people who
</p>
<p>built those cities so that they razed them to the
</p>
<p>ground, obliterated this nation from the earth and
</p>
<p>forced the few families which survived the general
</p>
<p>conflict to become wanderers to the North and West?
</p>
<p>What exposures, trials and vicissitudes have combined
</p>
<p>to reduce those survivors of that once great and
</p>
<p>marked civilization to a state of primeval wretched-
</p>
<p>ness, from which their ancestors, thousands of years
</p>
<p>before, had climbed to an eminent degree of culture
</p>
<p>and refinement?
</p>
<p>How true it is that men and women owe everything
</p>
<p>to the conditions which surround them. Like the
</p>
<p>chameleon, it is those things which they live on and
</p>
<p>with which they surround themselves which give to

<p>them their tints and shades. Exposures, denials and

</p>
<p>discomforts distort, and make men and women savage.
</p>
<p>Diverse occupations, attractions and ease influence
</p>
<p>persons to become thinking, progressive and respon-
</p>
<p>sible beings. Thus musing, I fell asleep.
</p>
<p>It may have been midnight, when I was awakened.
</p>
<p>The fire was smouldering. The moon had climbed
</p>
<p>above the mountains and had thrown a soft light over
</p>
<p>the camp. There were foot steps and the breaking of
</p>
<p>twigs. An Indian came through the bushes from the
</p>
<p>beach with a turtle on his shoulder. He let it fall to
</p>
<p>the ground. It flopped violently. The Indian turned
</p>
<p>it on its back. It was quieted. He was a fisher just
</p>
<p>returned from the outer bay. He put a fish upon the
</p>
<p>live coals, seated himself upon a turtle shell, turned
</p>
<p>the fish once and when it was browned and steaming
</p>
<p>he took off the skin and scales (as one skins an eel)
</p>
<p>and, thus prepared, he ate it. After this he placed a
</p>
<p>peccari skin over the breast plate of a turtle, threw
</p>
<p>himself on top of both and, with a turtle shell for a
</p>
<p>pillow and his feet upon a sleeping dog, he was in a
</p>
<p>few minutes afterwards breathing heavily.
</p>
<p>We had traveled many days through wilderness and
</p>
<p>over swollen rivers in search of this out-of-way and
</p>
<p>little known bay. Our curiosity was keen to see the

</p>
<p>284 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>We stood motionless, nor changed our position, prob-
</p>
<p>ably for the best part of an hour, so riveted were we
</p>
<p>by the scene and its perfect quiet.
</p>
<p>We could not distinguish an outlet to the gulf.
</p>
<p>The mountains in front apparently joined those to the
</p>
<p>right without a break. The straits, which Stanley
</p>
<p>since named "Joshua," and "OlmiraBay" proper,
</p>
<p>were hidden from view in the center of high, pictur-
</p>
<p>esque mountains to the south. To the north and east
</p>
<p>stretched a level plain of grass and chapparal.
</p>
<p>The night, the stillness, the expanse of mountain-
</p>
<p>locked water, the circumstance of my coming, the hope
</p>
<p>Stanley had to here find a harbor, combined to make
</p>
<p>the occasion one of impressiveness to me, an impres-
</p>
<p>siveness which I always more or less feel when I am
</p>
<p>on that bay or in its vicinage. If the morning should
</p>
<p>discover a deep and safe channel to the Gulf of Cali -
</p>
<p>fornia, then here (decided Stanley at that midnight,
</p>
<p>hour) is the site for a great metropolitan city; on
</p>
<p>that water, now without a sail, will one day come the
</p>
<p>ships of every nation; on this plain will dwell happy
</p>
<p>families; the Australasian will crowd to this shore to
</p>
<p>be welcomed by the European, who shall come in train
</p>
<p>from the Atlantic seaboard, over plateaux and across
</p>
<p>sierras.
</p>
<p>As we stood and afterwards strolled upon the beach
</p>
<p>these thoughts grew into fancies. We pictured the
</p>
<p>shipping lying at anchor, saw the flags of many na-
</p>
<p>tions, heard the striking of the city clocks, looked at
</p>
<p>the stone quays shaded by palm trees and ornamented

<p>singing within the courts of the Moorish houses and
</p>
<p>only awakened from the trance and returned to our
</p>
<p>blankets after the dawn had tinged the eastern hor-
</p>
<p>izon.
</p>
<p>Before the sun peeped over the mountains that day
</p>
<p>ihe camp was astir. The big boy had taken fish and
</p>
<p>^turtle flesh on the ends of a stick, a la Chinese, and
</p>
<p>(trotted away to the settlements on the Rio Fuerte.
</p>
<p>We had some difficulty to persuade the Indian fisher
</p>
<p>[to take us in his canoe for a day's explorations. We
</p>
<p>&ot off, however, during the early forenoon; paddled
</p>
<p>[close to Pintocahui, a turtle-shaped island which lies
</p>
<p>a mile east by south of Mapan Hill; passed through
</p>
<p>She straits, since called "Joshua," and around Mumu-
</p>
<p>[Bahul Island into Olmira Bay proper, from where we
</p>
<p>paw the Farallon de San Ignacio standing guard at
</p>
<p>Ihe entrance to the gulf.
</p>
<p>Everything we examined combined to impress us
</p>
<p>prith the importance of these straits and bays for a
</p>
<p>feafe, deep and extensive anchorage. The scenic at-
</p>
<p>tractions were grand and picturesque. The advanta-
</p>
<p>ges of the north shore of the straits for commercial
</p>
<p>purposes were unique. Stone quays and piers could
</p>
<p>|>e built there quicker and cheaper than at any deep
</p>
<p>srater front I had ever examined.
</p>
<p>* I well remember how abundant and in -how many
</p>
<p>Varieties the fish were; how they jumped in schools
</p>
<p>from the channel, and how pretty they looked among
</p>
<p>fiie sea-growths and rocks, in the deep water near the
</p>
<p>shores.

<p>How astonished I was at the tameness of the birds.
</p>
<p>286 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>The pelicans, the snipes, the flamingoes, the blue
</p>
<p>herons, the ibis and the fish hawks did not seem to
</p>
<p>mind our presence any more than the Indians did the
</p>
<p>night before. I noticed many smaller birds little
</p>
<p>warblers, and heard some, about the size of our cat
</p>
<p>bird, sing in the bushes which covered the hills and
</p>
<p>presented varieties of flowers that I had never seen
</p>
<p>before, and I can now see afar the great swallow-
</p>
<p>tailed hawks as they soared, far above mountains,
</p>
<p>over the bay, in the clear blue firmament which cano-
</p>
<p>pies this region most days of the year.
</p>
<p>That night as I rested on my blanket and looked
</p>
<p>into the glowing embers of the camp-fire, my thoughts
</p>
<p>recalled the excitements, the surprises of the day, and
</p>
<p>my eye followed the smoke as it curled up over the
</p>
<p>bushes and into the darkness, and my fancy formed
</p>
<p>with the smoke a model city, an inter-oceanic railroad
</p>
<p>and a Pacific merchant fleet.
</p>
<p>The second day on the shores of Olmira was passed
</p>
<p>partly on horseback and partly on foot, in examining
</p>
<p>the site for a city, and the approaches to the best
</p>
<p>front for commercial purposes. We went from Mapan
</p>
<p>to what has since become familiar as Shield's Burr
</p>
<p>Ridge, through Roger's and over Perkins' to Harbor
</p>
<p>Pass. Here, on the north shore of the straits, now
</p>
<p>"Joshua," we located, in our minds, the great quays
</p>
<p>and piers the shipping front of the metropolis to be.
</p>
<p>My companion passed the day sounding the channels
</p>
<p>in Olmira.
</p>
<p>Stanley was satisfied. I was more than convinced;

<p>I was enchanted with the idea that this was the place,
</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 287
</p>
<p>the best of all on the western coast of Mexico, for a
</p>
<p>great port. Nature had assuredly made here a great
</p>
<p>harbor. Enterprise would establish a great port; and
</p>
<p>a port having the geographical and the immediate
</p>
<p>back-country resources possessed by Olmira, would at-
</p>
<p>tract the exchanges of the earth.
</p>
<p>As we rode away that evening I felt that the fancies
</p>
<p>of our first and second nights on the shores of Olmira
</p>
<p>Bay would some day be more than realized. I settled
</p>
<p>that from that time on I would never rest until Olmira
</p>
<p>became "a household word" among commercial peo-
</p>
<p>ple; until the two republics of North America had
</p>
<p>utilized the advantages and Olmira had become a fa-
</p>
<p>vorite place to exchange for the nations of the world.
</p>
<p>And now, my adored ones, what shall I say of the
</p>
<p>prospective drama, the conception of which is another
</p>
<p>revelation to me of my father's genius, under the
</p>
<p>stress of untoward circumstances? It seems to me
</p>
<p>like the careful work of a conscientious scientist, who
</p>
<p>is highly qualified, after years of experimentation, to
</p>
<p>make an unerring choice of the ripe materials in his
</p>
<p>hands, and whose success is as assured (in advance of
</p>
<p>the trial) as is the conservation of the globe and
</p>
<p>human life to meet the hour.
</p>
<p>In taking the role of the "Wanderer," I shall re-
</p>
<p>quire none of the disguises you mention no meta-
</p>
<p>morphoses of the stage to prevent being recognized
</p>
<p>by an audience in St. Saul.

</p>
<p>preliend the great change in my personal appearance.
</p>
<p>Nothing perplexes me at this writing but the wonder-
</p>
<p>ful riddle of the "Sphinx," which you claim is your
</p>
<p>special privilege to keep until the last act of " The
</p>
<p>Mystery." Be it so, and rest assured, there is noth-
</p>
<p>ing in the astral turning point of destiny for me,
</p>
<p>nothing in the outcome of evolving events nor in
</p>
<p>heaven or earth, or fires within her bosom, that can
</p>
<p>break the indissoluble tie which knits our lives in

<p>kindred love.

<p>Your Devoted Son,

<p>" The Angel of Sleep will come to-night," said Mrs.
</p>
<p>Carlisle, as she sank into her husband's arms, and pil-
</p>
<p>lowed her head upon his faithful breast.

<p>******
</p>
<p>If Doctor Carlisle had been en rapport with the
</p>
<p>elements, and ordered the evening in advance, he
</p>
<p>could not have had a more auspicious night for the
</p>
<p>rendition of his play.
</p>
<p>The cultured world of St. Saul was out in full even-

<p>ing attire, hastening towards the imposing edifice
</p>
<p>from whose windows the lights flashed far out into
</p>
<p>the night, like so many fire-tongues, announcing their
</p>
<p>illuminating agency in the unravelment of "The
</p>
<p>Mystery."
</p>
<p>The lecture room had been engaged by Doctor
</p>
<p>Carlisle, and closed to the public for a number of

<p>days. To add to the furore of curiosity the Sphinx
</p>

</p>
<p>had disappeared from the park. On the previous
</p>
<p>evening lights had been seen to twinkle from the eyes
</p>
<p>and mouth of the monster, and a party of midnight
</p>
<p>strollers declared that a carriage, or the phantom of
</p>
<p>one, -was seen to enter the park from Tanglewood
</p>
<p>pike, and two persons a lady and a gentleman-
</p>
<p>alighted before the Sphinx, and one of them was de-
</p>
<p>voured, as only her companion reentered the carriage,
</p>
<p>which was driven away with the speed of the wind.
</p>
<p>Thus " The Mystery" had maintained the integrity
</p>
<p>of its name. Neither Doctor Carlisle nor his artists
</p>
<p>had appeared upon the street, and in the absence of
</p>
<p>preliminaries a notable exception was established to
</p>
<p>break the universal rule that '* coming events cast
</p>
<p>their shadows before."
</p>
<p>But " nothing is immortal in this world, save mor-
</p>
<p>tality;" so the hour which had been fixed upon for
</p>
<p>the opening of the doors arrived; and, "as one who
</p>
<p>has climbed a mountain height and carried up his
</p>
<p>own heart, scaling panting in his throat with the
</p>
<p>toil of the ascent, takes breath at last, and gazes back
</p>
<p>in triumph," so stood Carlisle and looked, and looking
</p>
<p>wondered if the T mple could contain the gather-

<p>CONCLUSION.
</p>
<p>"The world's a stage" on which all people act,
</p>
<p>Each his own role, an image or a fact
</p>
<p>Of something lived in an existence real
</p>
<p>There is no fiction in the realm ideal.
</p>
<p>Thought is immortal substance clear as light;
</p>
<p>Truth its divine exponent, faith its sight!
</p>
<p>Through the grand entrance to the lecture room,
</p>
<p>swept a tidal wave of humanity.
</p>
<p>No sooner had the great audience seated itself
</p>
<p>than its attention was c ccupied, by the novelty and
</p>
<p>refinement of its surroundings. In lieu of foot-lights
</p>
<p>an immense chandeUer was suspended from the ceil-
</p>
<p>ing by chains.
</p>
<p>Pendant from the center of the galleries opposite
</p>
<p>the drop-curtain (which was a marvel of oriental
</p>
<p>splendor), was an oblong Venetian mirror, repeating
</p>
<p>the brilliancy of the scene.
</p>
<p>Just as the orchestra began to tune, and curious
</p>
<p>eyes seemed determined to bore through the drop-
</p>
<p>curtain which ominously trembled and waved to and
</p>
<p>fro, a hush fell upon the house, and for a moment the un-
</p>
<p>precedented wealth of instrujrn -ntation was forgotten,

<p>lie testimonial of the Doctor's friendship for the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor, and reverent admiration for his wife.
</p>
<p>One quick, commanding glance, such as an empress
</p>
<p>might have thrown over her slaves the natural ex-
</p>
<p>pression of virtuous hauteur and conscious rectitude
</p>
<p>sweeping over parquette and galleries, as if seeking
</p>
<p>expected Enemies, and the lady was seated, and hund-
</p>
<p>reds of eyes dropped in shame before her innocent
</p>
<p>gaze.
</p>
<p>Never had Pearl looked more transcendently beauti-
</p>
<p>ful. Never had her presence so impressed and re-
</p>
<p>buked her evil-tougued adversaries, who were com-
</p>
<p>pelled to witness the perfect oration she received as
</p>
<p>when her cloak, a gorgeous crimson plush, lined with
</p>
<p>ermine, fell gracefully from her shoulders, revealing
</p>
<p>her matchless form simply but elegantly robed in
</p>
<p>white, without jewels other than those which sparkled
</p>
<p>and flashed from her glorious eyes, and a bunch of
</p>
<p>lilies, which rose and fell with the creamy folds of
</p>
<p>lace upon her bosom.
</p>
<p>Whether conscious or unconscious of her beauty,
</p>
<p>the good sense of this woman was betokened by her
</p>
<p>modest dress. Thus she quietly folded her wings, to
</p>
<p>prevent others from feeling they had none.
</p>
<p>" Who is this new lover?" said Hector Astore to
</p>
<p>Louisa Tongue worths, seated opposite, she gloated in
</p>
<p>jealous agony upon ^he radiant vision through her

</p>
<p>"O, that in her old flame, Stanley Veen," replied
</p>
<p>Louisa, who was making an inventory of Pearl's toilet
</p>
<p>"You did not recognize him, as he is frightfully
</p>
<p>changed since his recent illness. They say Governor
</p>
<p>Kellogg dragged him out of a saloon in a fit of de-
</p>
<p>lirium tremens; and that painted mink of his (an
</p>
<p>adept in nursing drunkards) brought him Fack to life,
</p>
<p>and doubtless with renewed ardor, again at her feet. At
</p>
<p>all events he does not seem to be in haste to return to
</p>
<p>his Mexican harem."
</p>
<p>" I have observed the same base proclivities in
</p>
<p>others high-born as Veen," replied Hector. " Men

<p>brought up in cultivated society seem to take the
</p>
<p>greatest pleasure in associating with common people,

<p>tendency in human cattle explains the eternal struggle

<p>reserved and dignified they are in their manners, the
</p>
<p>more they seem possessed to train in the society of
</p>
<p>worthless men and blemished women."
</p>

</p>
<p>less and wearisome of labors, followed as a vocation;
</p>
<p>so I temper the ardor of my disposition by the indol-
</p>
<p>ence of my nature," and the passion-freighted Louisa,
</p>
<p>with a kittenish shrug of the shoulders, wrinkled up
</p>
<p>the dry parchment of her facial cuticle into what she
</p>
<p>imagined to be a most winsome smile, but which would
</p>
<p>only have suggested to a good physiognomist the
</p>
<p>painful crisis in some occult and griping infirmity.
</p>
<p>" It is impossible to be dressed in better taste,"
</p>
<p>continued Louisa. " But what puzzles me is to see
</p>
<p>so many fashionable ladies here who look like apple-
</p>
<p>venders beside this girl, who carries herself with the
</p>
<p>air of a princess."
</p>
<p>"O," spitefully retorted the emerald-eyed widow.
</p>
<p>" This is also a trick of the profession; the art of seem-

<p>line of her figure; while the delicacy of the drapery

<p>in which she has developed it, gives her the sem-

<p>her gaze from the Governor's box to the implacable
</p>
<p>Hector, to note the effect of her grand eloquence, but
</p>
<p>was startled to see Lady Astore pale as death and as
</p>
<p>motionless, staring in the direction of the Venetian

<p>mirror.
</p>
<p>"What is the matter with you, old gal?" said
</p>
<p>Louisa. " You are not going to imitate Narcissus,

<p>because you cannot reach your beautiful reflection,

<p>are you ?"

<p>you see in the mirror?"
</p>
<p>"I see the drop-curtain only," answered her com-

<p>" Oh! Come down from your stilts; I am in no mood

<p>not see her here to-night."
</p>
<p>" No one really knows what the poor girl has done
</p>
<p>with herself. You know, she was too full of quirks,
</p>
<p>like her brother there?" said Miss Tonguewort. "At
</p>
<p>last accounts she was in a convent for the avowed ob-

<p>"You forget Doctor and Mrs. Carlisle, and their
</p>
<p>pimping blonde," rejoined the widow Astore, with a
</p>
<p>sinister expression in her face. " How I detested
</p>
<p>that saxon-haired jackanapes, who insulted me at our
</p>
<p>first interview. He had something such eyes as O,
</p>
<p>God and devils! There he is again! Rake hades
</p>
<p>over and his face cannot be duplicated. He is look-
</p>
<p>ing at me. O demons of darkness! " and the hue of
</p>
<p>death overspread her features, as she sank back, cov-
</p>
<p>ering her eyes with both hands.
</p>
<p>Only the searcher of hearts could see the dark re-
</p>
<p>solves so lately firmly fixed in her mind, one by one
</p>
<p>escaping through every nerve and tissue of her trem-
</p>
<p>bling frame; and now while Miss Tonguewort is vig-
</p>
<p>orously fanning the shattered mind together again,
</p>
<p>let us investigate the reflection in the Venetian mirror.
</p>
<p>It is a gentleman's front, and he sits so near, it is
</p>
<p>only when he bends forward that the double of his
</p>
<p>face falls upon the margin of the great reflector. He
</p>
<p>is not old, he is not youthful looking; but his coun-
</p>
<p>tenance is exceedingly striking and distinguished.
</p>
<p>The large blue eyes, the full lips, the high and
</p>
<p>thoughtful forehead, the hair still dark, luxuriant and
</p>
<p>waving, identify him at once to her who has carried
</p>
<p>his image within her brain thirty years.

</p>
<p>He is a stranger and a foreigner. If he has friends
</p>
<p>in St. Saul, he has not permitted them to welcome
</p>
<p>him, and since alighting from the train he has not had
</p>
<p>time to register at any of the hotels. He is commis-
</p>
<p>sioned hither, as is apparent from the careful ar-
</p>
<p>rangement of his papers within his grip, from

<p>ing at the rear of the stage, and addressing his son.

<p>an old acquaintance of yours in that box. When we
</p>
<p>are walking through graveyards, we must step cau-
</p>
<p>tiously over every undulation, or we may trample
</p>
<p>upon the bones of our ancestors."
</p>
<p>The young man looked puzzled, but smilingly re-
</p>
<p>plied:
</p>
<p>" The walls of the Sphinx are yet reverberating our
</p>
<p>praises. It is a grand thing to possess vulnerable
</p>
<p>points, especially when one can be like a chip-squirrel

<p>in the wall seeing and hearing all, yet seen and
</p>
<p>heard by none. If the play rewards your genius as

<p>well as do the operations of this admirable little ma-

<p>chine, my father will be crowned to-night, not only as
</p>
<p>the peer of artists, but that noblest work of God."
</p>
<p>"Say no more my son," interrupted the Doctor, "the
</p>
<p>eyes of love are partial. I have only striven to do
</p>
<p>my duty." Here both recognized the final notes of
</p>
<p>the orchestra, and the son disappeared in the scenery,
</p>
<p>while the father vanished through a secret door in the
</p>
<p>side of the Sphinx, saying, as he entered the little

<p>observatory prepared for the invisible actor: "Lord,
</p>
<p>abide with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is

<p>far spent."

<p>a stir in the audience as the strings take up a low

</p>
<p>tremolo movement, growing softer and fainter; and
</p>
<p>the musicians, one by one noiselessly depart, and it
</p>
<p>grows darker and lonelier around the orchestra. And
</p>
<p>now the lights from the tree of the grand chandelier
</p>
<p>are lowered till they only present the tiniest points of
</p>
<p>flame, and a shudder creeps over the audience, even
</p>
<p>though it is accompanied by a smile, at the strange-
</p>
<p>ness of it all.
</p>
<p>It is the last moment of suspense, and the curtain
</p>
<p>slowly rises upon an impossible picture of mortal
</p>
<p>loveliness, clothed in summer verdure and autumnal
</p>
<p>dreaminess. The yellow moonlight floated, a tremb-
</p>
<p>ling veil of transparent gold, over the landscape, light-
</p>
<p>ing up deep interstices of forest, and heightening the
</p>
<p>effect of a floral ambuscade of some huge object at the
</p>
<p>rear of the stage.
</p>
<p>The foreground was a grass plat, with broad alleys
</p>
<p>of bloom, in the center of which stood a marble
</p>
<p>shrine, dazzlingly white in the amber light; and,
</p>
<p>legible to all, over its arch-way of prayer were the
</p>
<p>words :

<p>with the motto in gold lettering beneath:

</p>
<p>everywhere. The door of a summer house near by
</p>
<p>stood open, as if some radiant vision of the night had
</p>
<p>just passed through, and only the cool plash of a
</p>
<p>fountain, and rustling music, as of whispering winds,
</p>
<p>stirred the profound repose.
</p>
<p>The effect was magical, and one could distinctly
</p>
<p>hear one's own heart beat in the stillness which per-
</p>
<p>vaded the house. The next moment there burst forth
</p>
<p>such a storm of applause as never reverberated within
</p>
<p>church walls, quickly followed by a call for the artist
</p>
<p>But in lieu of such acknowledgment, the embankment
</p>
<p>of flowers gracefully bent forward, to the manifest ap-
</p>
<p>preciation of the audience.
</p>
<p>When silence was restored, a flute was heard, as if
</p>
<p>from a distance, playing the prelude of a song; and
</p>
<p>now a lady emerges from the dense shadows, passes
</p>
<p>through the arbor, and approaches the shrine. She
</p>
<p>is the ideal of a Roman woman. Tall, splendidly pro-
</p>
<p>portioned, lithe-footed as a fawn, with starry midnight
</p>
<p>eyes, out of whose dusky depths shine boundless pos-
</p>
<p>sibilities of passion, yet with a force and energy which
</p>
<p>betrays also the wealth of nature's full complement
</p>
<p>in spiritual powers.
</p>
<p>She was clothed in a white neglige of some light
</p>
<p>and costly material, with a myrtle leaf, sitting like a
</p>
<p>crown upon her rich, abundant hair. Her complexion

<p>was as pure as marble, with only a thought of ruddi-

</p>
<p>ness, the shell pink bloom of youth, on her beautiful
</p>
<p>lips.
</p>
<p>As if unconscious of her audience, and wrapt in the
</p>
<p>spell of loveliness around her, she breathed forth the
</p>
<p>emotions of her soul, not in the snarl of trills and
</p>
<p>roulades one is accustomed to hear, but in a song out
</p>
<p>of nature's heart, ringing with a sweetness and fire
</p>
<p>that carried every hearer irresistibly:
</p>
<p>HER SONG.
</p>
<p>Fair moon! As you sail through your star-lighted dome,
</p>
<p>O lead him, my wanderer, back to his home!
</p>
<p>The lights are gone out on his hearth-stone and mine;
</p>
<p>And the rekindling spark, it is thine, it is thine!
</p>
<p>(She kneels.)
</p>
<p>Again, at this same little gateway of prayer,
</p>
<p>St. Agnew, I kneel in my latent despair.
</p>
<p>It was here we were pledged in the far away past;
</p>
<p>And here I return for thy blessing, at last.
</p>
<p>Lead gently and truly, fair queen of the night;
</p>
<p>He walks in the darkness, and thou in the light.
</p>
<p>(She prays.)
</p>
<p>Dear Jesus, God-master, with human heart beat,
</p>
<p>Hear my prayer in these kisses I pour at thy feet.
</p>
<p>It is thine, this endowment of wonderful love
</p>
<p>First showered on Thee from the wings of a dove.
</p>
<p>Pluck it out of my life, or bid it unfold,
</p>
<p>Like the scroll of the morning, in purple and gold.
</p>
<p>(On rising, she hears a voice issuing out of the Sphinx,
</p>
<p>whose hideous proportions are concealed by an embankment
</p>
<p>of flowers.)
</p>

<p>(Supposing it to be a spirit, she answers:)
</p>
<p>One who hath at the Master's feet,
</p>
<p>Learned life's great lesson, patience sweet;
</p>
<p>And in the garden walked with Him,
</p>
<p>Who makes the cross a cherubim.
</p>
<p>(The voice replies:)
</p>
<p>But surely God is not alone
</p>
<p>In all your thoughts, since you enthrone
</p>
<p>A lover there, whose fortune makes
</p>
<p>A martyr to her sad mistakes.
</p>
<p>Behold the message at thy feet,
</p>
<p>The ground is holy where we meet.
</p>
<p>(She stoops, picks up a scroll and reads:)
</p>
<p>"God's messengers are in the wind;
</p>
<p>They breathe of heaven and all things kind.
</p>
<p>Around thy being like a zone.
</p>
<p>There arms of mercy are now thrown.
</p>
<p>But one more test remains to thee,
</p>
<p>Ere breaks the seal of mystery.
</p>
<p>The moonlight walks the path before
</p>
<p>The Druid chapel's open door,
</p>
<p>Where every year, when Nature grieves,
</p>
<p>She sheds, like tears, her falling leaves,
</p>
<p>A Druidess is found within,
</p>
<p>Who ferrets out all secret sin
</p>
<p>And makes the wretched author bear

<p>The burden of its dark despair.
</p>
<p>This night her judgment throne is spread;
</p>
<p>And every tear of anguish shed,
</p>
<p>Burns in the rainbow 'round her head.

<p>To her repair and there await

<p>The stern arbitrament of fate.

<p>Their prayers on midnight stars ascend.
</p>
<p>Haste! and God's angels thee attend.
</p>
<p>A curtain of mist falls, through which she is seen to
</p>
<p>glide swiftly away and disappear beyond the embank-

<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 303
</p>
<p>ment of flowers The mist dissolves, floating away
</p>
<p>upon the plaintive notes of a serenade; and the scene
</p>
<p>is changed to bloom. The moon rides high in a mid-
</p>
<p>night sky; but her beams are obscured by black
</p>
<p>patches of clouds driven before the breath of the
</p>
<p>tempest. A leafless forest rises, stretching its naked
</p>
<p>branches heavenward, as in voiceless prayer. A scene
</p>
<p>so sombre, solemn and cold, it invokes the silent tribute
</p>
<p>of a shiver from the audience.
</p>
<p>In the foreground, surrounded by grey dead mosses
</p>
<p>and lichen, stands the pale shrine of St. Agnew. Its
</p>
<p>bright wreaths, faded and torn, lie wind-strewn at its
</p>
<p>base, and within the arch a candle burns dimly and
</p>
<p>flickeringly into its ebony socket.
</p>
<p>The mist-cloud hangs heavy at the rear of the stage,
</p>
<p>concealing the embankment of flowers; and the lights
</p>
<p>have been lowered throughout the building to enhance
</p>
<p>the gloom, rendered all the more effective by an in-
</p>
<p>visible chorus distinctly repeating the motto of St.
</p>
<p>Agnew: " God, watching over us, slumbers not, nor
</p>
<p>sleeps."
</p>
<p>Then tremble again the strings of an instrument,
</p>
<p>and faint and far-off melodies breathe forth into the
</p>
<p>night, which gathers thicker and blacker around, as
</p>
<p>the figure of a man enveloped in a cloak, approaches
</p>
<p>the shrine.

</p>
<p>Falling upon his knees before the shrine, his rich

<p>voice took up the recitative of a song, in tones so im-

<p>ploring, that it seemed the petition of a wounded

</p>
<p>HIS PRAYER.
</p>
<p>I am a wanderer, God's fair earth
</p>
<p>Gives me no place, no home, no birth,
</p>
<p>No kindred, no delightful aim,
</p>
<p>The heritage of honored name.
</p>
<p>Robbed of these gifts, I'm reft of all

<p>Which makes earth's loveliness a thrall.

<p>Illusion played her park so well,

<p>The dismal shadow never fell

<p>Upon my life, till my false name

<p>Essayed to link the bridal chain.
</p>
<p>Then Fortune hurled her fatal dart;

<p>O reckless aim, she missed my heart.
</p>
<p>So heart and fortune wage the war
</p>
<p>Which fate began in climes afar;
</p>
<p>And though I trace my birth-star down
</p>
<p>Below the brood of Heaven's crown,
</p>
<p>Into the depths of sin and shame,
</p>
<p>Deep as my sire hath dragged his name,

<p>There and there only would I trace

<p>" Wanderer, God hath heard thy prayer,
</p>
<p>Borne from Agnew's holy stair.
</p>
<p>At the hour of midnight gloom,
</p>
<p>Light of stars and light of moon
</p>
<p>Shall forsake the earth, all sight
</p>
<p>Swallowed up in noon of night.
</p>
<p>Haste! The morning dawns apace,
</p>
<p>When the secrets of thy race
</p>
<p>Shall be scattered as the leaves
</p>
<p>When the heart of nature grieves.

<p>Promptly at the midnight hour,
</p>
<p>Ere its last stroke in the tower
</p>
<p>Be at Druid Chapel's door;
</p>
<p>Angels walk the path before."
</p>
<p>At this moment a flood of light enveloped the shrine.
</p>
<p>Soft and distant tones of music were borne in upon
</p>
<p>the audience a melody so reverent, so tender, so be-
</p>
<p>seeching, the beams of light seemed to thrill and vi-
</p>
<p>brate to the sweet notes till they mingled with each
</p>
<p>other on the air; and with the vanishing figure of the
</p>
<p>wanderer, the curtain descended to the height of the
</p>
<p>shrine, where it waved tremulously, as though rocked
</p>
<p>in the breath of the whispered chorus, repeating the
</p>
<p>impressive recitation: "Lord, have mercy upon us!
</p>
<p>Christ, have mercy upon us! " Fainter and farther
</p>
<p>off echoed the pathetic wail until, sustained by a soli-
</p>
<p>tary instrument, it died away. The lights were ex-
</p>
<p>tinguished, the candle fell into its socket, and total
</p>
<p>darkness shrouded the scene.

<p>As soon as the applause subsided, the lights were

<p>306 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>the open doors of an ancient temple, circular, and
</p>
<p>open at the top, through which the mysterious order of
</p>
<p>fire worshippers were supposed to consult directly the
</p>
<p>secret will of divinity. Within an arch supporting
</p>
<p>the dome, was Cornelius' statue of the " Last Judg-
</p>
<p>ment," over which sparkled, in quaint lettering, the
</p>
<p>Druid motto: " To reform morals, to secure justice
</p>
<p>and peace and to encourage goodness.' 5
</p>
<p>Slowly and solemnly the bell tolled forth the mid-
</p>
<p>night hour. At each stroke a beam of light fell from
</p>
<p>the azure ceiling to the marble masaic below, until a
</p>
<p>ribbon of light enveloped the stage, and the antique
</p>
<p>temple stood belted in its splendors.
</p>
<p>In the lingering vibrations of the twelfth stroke, a
</p>
<p>tall vase of pure alabaster was brought out of the tem-
</p>
<p>ple and placed in the foreground, and a chorus of
</p>
<p>voices fron within the temple sang an invocation to
</p>
<p>the Druid Priestess to come forth and declare the
</p>
<p>mystery.
</p>
<p>Every eye was directed to the door of the temple,
</p>
<p>when suddenly, like a white lily bursting its bud, the
</p>
<p>pale Priestess rose out of the crown of the vase to her
</p>
<p>full height, her long snowy surplice falling to her del-
</p>
<p>icately sandaled feet.

<p>was unearthly, and the applause of the audience loud
</p>
<p>and long so long, that the glad-hearted Doctor, en-
</p>
<p>sconced in his secret observatory and resonator could
</p>
<p>scarcely persuade himself that he did not hear a
</p>
<p>supernal and tenuous clapping of hands, and a light
</p>
<p>" Bravo! " echoed from invisible lips.
</p>
<p>And now distinctly the voice of the Priestess was
</p>
<p>heard from out the cloud. Not a word of the solemn
</p>
<p>recitative was lost, either upon the heart of the
</p>
<p>stranger whose fitful reflection in the mirror con-
</p>
<p>tinued to disturb the tranquil ity of the Tonguewort's
</p>
<p>guest or upon her,of whose presence he little dreamed,
</p>
<p>whose soul was moved by the voice of the speaker.
</p>
<p>THE MYSTKRY.
</p>
<p>I hold in my bands a mystic ball,
</p>
<p>I wind and unwind, release and recall,
</p>
<p>Till it passes over the heads of all.
</p>
<p>Its strands are the ravelled threads of fate ;
</p>
<p>Those deviating lines of bate
</p>
<p>The powers of darkness alone create
</p>
<p>At every circle around the hall,
</p>
<p>Made by the magic, mystical ball,
</p>
<p>I gather the hidden secrets of all.
</p>
<p>(The ball here made a visible circuit of the hall and returned
</p>
<p>to the hand of the Priestess, who gazing intently thereon, ex-
</p>
<p>claimed.)
</p>
<p>I see a horrible, ghastly thing,
</p>
<p>Forever and ever upon the wing.
</p>
<p>Devils of darkness are in its path;
</p>
<p>And hell is the terminus of its wrath.

</p>
<p>It takes all shapes, like the shifting wind

<p>Stab, strangle or drown it will not die,
</p>
<p>This monster and curse of the world a lie!
</p>
<p>Ye who follow its evil guide.
</p>
<p>See what horrors its black wings hide!
</p>
<p>Out of the beautiful light of day,
</p>
<p>See the doomed one led away ;
</p>
<p>Hear the clank of his prison chain,
</p>
<p>And the plea of innocence, made in vain.
</p>
<p>In manhood's prime he goeth down,
</p>
<p>But he wears, to-night, a martyr's crown.
</p>
<p>Here a thrilling pantomine exhibition is given with
</p>
<p>effective scenery, delineating the startling facts
</p>
<p>brought out in the affidavit furnished at the death-bed
</p>
<p>confession of John Durant.
</p>
<p>The audience grows more attentive, and toilet res-
</p>
<p>toratives are administered to the pallid guest in the
</p>
<p>Tonguewort box; while the relentless ball unwinds,
</p>
<p>and the solemn recitative continues:
</p>
<p>I see a mother desert her child
</p>
<p>Helpless infancy undefiled
</p>
<p>But the Angel of Mercy is everywhere,
</p>
<p>And the child is the pride of a millionaire.
</p>
<p>Here a pantomine picture is given of the wanderer's
</p>
<p>birth in a foreign land; his desertion by the mother
</p>
<p>who thinks thereby to hide the crime of having sent
</p>
<p>his father to a felon's cell. The attempt to bribe the
</p>
<p>hospital nurse to murder the babe was vividly deli-
</p>
<p>neated. A Christian lady having that very day passed

</p>
<p>covering it "with tears and kisses, and believing God
</p>
<p>had thus restored to her the crown of maternity, she
</p>
<p>lavishes upon it all the wealth of a mother's devotion.
</p>
<p>The real mother might have been buried in oblivion,
</p>
<p>had she not in her precipitate flight, dropped a me-
</p>
<p>dallion locket, containing a likeness of her cruel lady-
</p>
<p>ship, with the full name of her husband (the father
</p>
<p>of the infant) engraved upon it.
</p>
<p>This locket the nurse had slipped into the basket,
</p>
<p>but remarkable to say, it was found by the foster-
</p>
<p>mother, tightly clasped in the tiny fist of the babe.
</p>
<p>As a key in the arch of mystery, this inanimate tri-
</p>
<p>fle proves of more value to its possessor than all the
</p>
<p>kingdoms of this world. It has modestly refrained
</p>
<p>from voicing its name, until that name redeemed from
</p>
<p>obscurity, should be worn by him whose hour of cor-
</p>
<p>onation is now at hand. Here, the ball struck the
</p>
<p>floor, and the Priestess held up to the audience a
</p>
<p>small gold locket, exclaiming: "The name upon the
</p>
<p>locket now for the first time pronounced and given to
</p>
<p>the world, and to the son of him who ever honored it,
</p>
<p>is 'Alfred Clifford ' a gentleman whose extended
</p>
<p>labors in behalf of prison reform are well known
</p>
<p>throughout the civilized world."

<p>At this juncture the speaker was interrupted and

<p>the audience fairly electrified, by a woman's piercing

<p>shriek, supplemented by a series of short hysterical

</p>
<p>The disturbance was in the Tongue wort box, the
</p>
<p>improvised curtains of which had been summaraily
</p>
<p>drawn by the agitated Louisa, after screaming "fire! "
</p>
<p>to stampede the audience, and in the hope of divert-
</p>
<p>ing the lady Astore from the madness of leaping upon
</p>
<p>the stage and unmasking and confessing her social
</p>
<p>atrocities.
</p>
<p>The startling phraseology of Miss Tonguewort
</p>
<p>brought the assembly to its feet, and a scene of the
</p>
<p>wildest confusion must have followed, had not Doctor
</p>
<p>Carlisle emerged from out the embankment of flowers,
</p>
<p>waved his hand, and with his assuring manner, re-
</p>
<p>stored order.
</p>
<p>Nothing could have more effectually tranquilized
</p>
<p>his auditory, and prepared them for the scene which
</p>
<p>followed.
</p>
<p>The curtains of the Tonguewort pew parted, and
</p>
<p>the jets from the chandelier blazed directly into the
</p>
<p>face of a dark-visaged woman, bareheaded, whose dis-
</p>
<p>hevelled hair, disordered dress'and distorted features
</p>
<p>made her appear as if struggling to free herself from
</p>
<p>some one concealed behind her. Her lips quivered
</p>
<p>in the labor-pains of speech, which had no sound or
</p>
<p>language adequate.
</p>
<p>At length, breaking away from the detaining hand
</p>
<p>and leaping like a panther to the stage, sho stood like

<p>some wild beast at bay, gazing wildly around her.

</p>
<p>The Druidess slowly advanced, and holding up a
</p>
<p>branch of mistletoe (esteemed the antidote for all
</p>
<p>poison and the cure of all diseases) she said:
</p>
<p>" Woman, if you have a confession to make, humble
</p>
<p>yourself before this emblem of Almighty God."
</p>
<p>"Confession! Fiends! Yes; but not to you. Un-
</p>
<p>loose the souls I've chained in fetters worse than the
</p>
<p>frost-chains of death, or the hermetic seals of stifling
</p>
<p>coffin lids. Bring him I've wronged the most! I've
</p>
<p>seen his ghost. I did not mean to murder him. I
</p>
<p>was beside myself with jealousy and the mad hatred
</p>
<p>of my rival, passions which unwittingly consent to
</p>
<p>crime. O God, I seek that mercy so much lauded in
</p>
<p>Thy name! "
</p>
<p>Breaking a sacred branch from the holy cluster of
</p>
<p>evergreens, she seized it in her trembling hands,
</p>
<p>kissed it and placed it in her bosom.
</p>
<p>"Now go," she said, "and leave me alone with Him,"
</p>
<p>here she cast a cold, indifferent glance upon the sea
</p>
<p>of faces intently turned towards her, " and those who
</p>
<p>like to look at naked souls, heaven-scourged. I was
</p>
<p>not cradled for such crimes. I have dishonored birth

</p>
<p>not stare upon me with those piercing eyes! I am not

<p>lost, unless O torturing thought! unless death inter-
</p>
<p>cepts the meeting; and I am warned here, where God's
</p>
<p>vengence wounded me to-night The woman
</p>
<p>placed both hands over her heart, trembling, and
</p>
<p>gasping for breath; and though there was an attempt
</p>
<p>at feeble applause, it was suppressed, as the true nat-
</p>
<p>ure of the drama dawned upon the mind of every be-
</p>
<p>holder.
</p>
<p>The Druidess entered the temple, and the young
</p>
<p>man who had enacted the role of the "wanderer"
</p>
<p>came forth white as marble and with great trepida-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>The attention of the audience was absolute, and the
</p>
<p>stillness of death pervaded the house. The woman
</p>
<p>surveyed her son, the son his mother. Both seemed
</p>
<p>riveted to the spot.
</p>
<p>" Holy mother of Christ," uttered the woman with
</p>
<p>a shriek, "he does not forgive me!" Then reeling,
</p>
<p>and with a groan as from a shattered heart, she fell
</p>
<p>like a corpse upon the floor of the stage.
</p>
<p>Instantly the stage swarmed with actors. Doctor
</p>
<p>Carlisle, who had anticipated all emergencies was
</p>
<p>armed and equipped with restoratives and palliatives,
</p>
<p>which upon being administered, the woman soon

<p>cheeks. In the group were many who had left their
</p>
<p>seats in the auditory.
</p>
<p>" I am dying,' ' moaned the purple lips.
</p>
<p>"Oh no! We will not let you die," said a sweet-
</p>
<p>voiced lady, who had been chafing her temples, and
</p>
<p>rubbing the cold numb fingers with her own of rosy
</p>
<p>tint.
</p>
<p>"Am I forgiven? My life is waiting! " The words
</p>
<p>were spoken low and feebly, but by a readjustment of
</p>
<p>the resonator, the audience caught them all, as if the
</p>
<p>tragedy must be "stage-acting " to the end.
</p>
<p>" Yes, surely; all forgiven," answered the lady, who
</p>
<p>at the same moment significantly pressed the young
</p>
<p>man's hand, and urged him to speak the coveted words;
</p>
<p>but pale and motionless as breathing marble he re-
</p>
<p>mained.
</p>
<p>And now a stranger who had been some minutes in
</p>
<p>earnest converse with Doctor Carlisle, came and knelt.
</p>
<p>Taking the woman's hands in his he said:
</p>
<p>" Hector, I forgave you many years ago." The
</p>
<p>woman's eyes were closed, but she recognized the
</p>
<p>voice with a visible shudder, saying:
</p>
<p>" I thank you, and bless God."
</p>
<p>The next moment a messenger entered at the rear
</p>
<p>of the stage, approached the group around the dying
</p>
<p>woman and presented a note to Doctor Carlisle, the

</p>
<p>private nature of which, under any ot her circum-
</p>
<p>314 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>stances, must have been regarded sacred as his profes-
</p>
<p>sional honor. Now, the stage was turned over to the
</p>
<p>audience, and the note must be read at the instant of
</p>
<p>its reception, sensational as it proved. It read as
</p>
<p>follows:
</p>
<p>DOCTOR CARLISLE:
</p>
<p>Having witnessed your cranky feats of skull-
</p>
<p>duggery this evening, without coming under the evil
</p>
<p>spell of the infernal machine you have put upon the
</p>
<p>stage to mesmerize the people of St. Saul, I command
</p>
<p>you to deliver over to the bearer of this the mutilated
</p>
<p>remains of my friend Mrs. Astore, with whom you
</p>
<p>have experimented and deceived the community into
</p>
<p>believing words ventriloquized through her, and never
</p>
<p>thought of before outside your addled brains.
</p>
<p>In case you prove daring enough to ignore this
</p>
<p>civil demand, a writ of Habeas Corpus will be served
</p>
<p>instanter. Disdainfully Yours,
</p>
<p>MlSS LOUISA TONGDEWORT.
</p>
<p>As Doctor Carlisle, finished reading, wider and
</p>
<p>wider expanded the staring eyes of Hector Clifford,
</p>
<p>until their expression was horrible and ghastly.
</p>
<p>Raising herself until her head rested upon her
</p>
<p>brawny arm, she said in a hoarse whisper:
</p>
<p>" Tell Louisa Tongue wort Mrs. Astore is dead or,
</p>
<p>rather, Hector Clifford has just cast oub a devil by
</p>
<p>that name. Tell her to come to me instantly; that no
</p>
<p>one will dispute her sole claim to the posession of my

</p>
<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 315
</p>
<p>Contrary to every expectation. Miss Tonguewort
</p>
<p>answered in person, saying, as she pushed her way
</p>
<p>rudely into the face of the dying Hector:
</p>
<p>" I am come. Will you go at once with me, and end
</p>
<p>this ridiculous role of yours?"
</p>
<p>" Presently. I must not slam the door of mercy
</p>
<p>and forgiveness, now held ajar. I have one more con-
</p>
<p>fession yet to make, and I adjure you, to not dispute
</p>
<p>the man of God through whom I speak. I read your
</p>
<p>fears, but you are safe as I have only time to shrive
</p>
<p>my perjured self. See ! My head never rested upon
</p>
<p>so pure and white a pillow since cradled on the breast
</p>
<p>of her who bore me."
</p>
<p>Now Lady Tonguewort was insulated by a thick
</p>
<p>veil from direct contact with the object commended to
</p>
<p>her; but the shock was no less shattering, causing her
</p>
<p>to revolve about the stage like a magnetized spindle,
</p>
<p>alternating each bound with a sharp shriek, which
</p>
<p>scattered the impromptu actors as effectually"as a vol-
</p>
<p>ley of musketry could have done.
</p>
<p>Doctor Carlisle's attention being unwillingly diver-
</p>
<p>ted to this new patient, whose hysterical antics threat-
</p>
<p>ened to interfere with the concluding scenes now in
</p>
<p>preparation within the Temple, he directed the lady's
</p>
<p>attendant to assist in gathering the rotating drapery
</p>
<p>before the climax of a collapse should further com-

</p>
<p>plicate his trying position as stage manager.
</p>
<p>316 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY.
</p>
<p>The parting glance given to the audience, revealed
</p>
<p>the convulsive efforts of the ejected Tongue wort to-
</p>
<p>ward removing piece-meal, the ornamental covering
</p>
<p>to the Doctor's scalp.
</p>
<p>The last visible squirm furnished a picturesque ac-
</p>
<p>companiment to her parting words, keyed to reach the
</p>
<p>audience :
</p>
<p>" I give you fair warning, the world has gone mad,
</p>
<p>and Doctor Carlisle is an old wizard and spiritualistic
</p>
<p>prestidigitator ! "
</p>
<p>The curtain was here lowered upon this spectacular,
</p>
<p>and Doctor Carlisle soon appeared before it, thanking
</p>
<p>the audience for their attention, and begging them to
</p>
<p>support him with their presence to the end. The re-
</p>
<p>maining confession he said would be given to them
</p>
<p>from the lips of Doctor Carroll, rector of St. Mark's.
</p>
<p>In a irief space the curtain rose upon the final
</p>
<p>scene. The huge proportions of the Sphinx and the
</p>
<p>lofty Temple of the Druids had disappeared, and in
</p>
<p>their places stood the beautiful shrine of St. Agnew,
</p>
<p>covered with lilies, and beside, yet not touching a
</p>
<p>couch was spread, upon which lay the expiring penit-
</p>
<p>ent. Her blanched face looked calmer and she clasped
</p>
<p>convulsively the bough of mistletoe.
</p>
<p>The scene was sorrowful, as every one who witnessed
</p>
<p>it was made to realize its awful actuality.

<p>Soft strains of instrumental music now floated

<p>A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY. 317
</p>
<p>through the open doors of a little chapel, followed by
</p>
<p>the wedding march of Mendelssohn, in tempo with the
</p>
<p>solemn march of death.
</p>
<p>The dying woman's eyes were turned expectant
</p>
<p>towards the ohapel, across the threshold of which filed
</p>
<p>a goodly procession of thoughtful-faced men and
</p>
<p>women, who arranged themselves in a semi-circle be-
</p>
<p>hind the shrine. Prominent among these were to be
</p>
<p>recognized Doctor and Mrs. Carlisle, Sir Alfred Clif-
</p>
<p>ford, Stanley Veen and his sister Miss Cecile Veen
</p>
<p>(prima donna of the evening) Governor and Mrs.
</p>
<p>Pearl LaGrange Kellogg, and many other distin-
</p>
<p>guished personages.
</p>
<p>At this point a profound sensation was produced,
</p>
<p>as the Rector of St. Mark's stepped forth and Hugh
</p>
<p>Carlisle Clifford and Miss Cecile Veen joined hands
</p>
<p>before him at the shrine.
</p>
<p>The woman was sinking rapidly, and in token of
</p>
<p>their forgiveness, the young people consented to be
</p>
<p>married before her expiring gaze.
</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the marriage service, Rev.
</p>
<p>Doctor Carroll addressed the audience substantially as
</p>
<p>follows :

</p>
<p>like as have been to me the scenes of the evening.

<p>of the ordinary line of dramatic entertainment. We

</p>
<p>have witnessed thrilling scenes, whose conclusion is
</p>
<p>a mournful tragic death and a romantic marriage;
</p>
<p>Stranger than any fiction.
</p>
<p>" The dying woman is well known to all as one of
</p>
<p>my old parishioners, who in her palmy days, wielded
</p>
<p>a social sceptre. ( Sensation in the audience. ) Be-
</p>
<p>hold her now, as shorn of vanity as Lazarus was when

<p>lying at the rich man's gate, and humble as the dogs

<p>which licked his sores. Low in the dust of deep con-
</p>
<p>trition, with not her least, though last confession to
</p>
<p>be made through me.
</p>
<p>" As the physical invalid, in a moment of terror
</p>
<p>from fire or flood, springs from the couch he thought
</p>
<p>never to leave, so moral decrepitude throws by its
</p>
<p>crutches and runs like a deer, upon feeling the con-
</p>
<p>tract of a holy spirit

</p>
<p>subjects spiritually apathetic, until some dire neces-
</p>
<p>sity swoops down upon them with the whip of scorp-
</p>
<p>ions, and forces them to mend their ways.

<p>nor the injustice completely repaired. Dropped like
</p>
<p>a seed into the ground, vital forces have taken poses-
</p>
<p>sion of it and worked upon it. The poison had been
</p>
<p>communicated to the air and the victim.
</p>
<p>Doomed, like Prometheus, to be torn,
</p>
<p>By vultures' beak, from night till morn,
</p>
<p>And still its flesh renew
</p>
<p>To gratify the insatiate maw
</p>
<p>Of wretches who forever gnaw
</p>
<p>At what they can't gnaw through.
</p>
<p>" The sin of a monstrous falsehood rests on this wo-
</p>
<p>man's soul. A lie which was conceived, born and
</p>
<p>bred and taught to run alone in the streets of this
</p>
<p>city. Commissioned to hail the stranger and to whis-
</p>
<p>per its dark and evil insinuations into unsuspecting
</p>
<p>ears. A lie which might not have been confessed and
</p>
<p>extinguished with the breath of its originator, had not
</p>
<p>its innocent victim been first to reach and minister to'
</p>
<p>the stricken wretch before you, pouring the balm of
</p>
<p>healing words into her ears and urging the reluctant
</p>
<p>lips of her son to repeat from her own, the noble words
</p>
<p>of forgiveness.
</p>
<p>"The news this country has been awaiting has just
</p>
<p>reached the Governor's box, calling him and his lady
</p>
<p>to their home where friends and congratulations await

<p>them. ( Sensation profound throughout the house. )
</p>
<p>320 A SOCIAL CONSPIRACY
</p>
<p>" The election of Governor Kellogg to the United
</p>
<p>States Senate, marks the division between church and
</p>
<p>state, or society and state; for society's ambush is a
</p>
<p>temple of worship. I believe that among the revilers
</p>
<p>of his lovely wife are many who would not wish to
</p>
<p>have their secret lives exposed. The victory, there-
</p>
<p>fore which places this lady above and out of the reach
</p>
<p>of her persecutors, is a triumph of free thought and
</p>
<p>humanitarianism.
</p>
<p>" ' The world is old', says the Poet Browning, ' but
</p>
<p>the old world waits the hour to be renewed, toward
</p>
<p>which new hearts, in individual growth, must quicken
</p>
<p>and increase to multitude; enveloped whence shall
</p>
<p>grow, spontaneously, new churches, new economies,
</p>
<p>new laws admitting freedom; new societies, excluding
</p>
<p>falsehood.'
</p>
<p>"And to this I would add the words of Christ:
</p>
<p>' Blessed are ye when men (or women) shall revile
</p>
<p>you and persecute and shall say all manner of evil
</p>
<p>against you falsely, for my sake; for great shall be
</p>
<p>your reward in Heaven.' "
</p>
<p>The Rector of St. Mark's lifted both hands. The
</p>
<p>audience rose, and retired, with these final words
</p>
<p>from Doctor Carlisle ringing in their ears:
</p>
<p>HECTOR CLIFFORD is DEAD AND PEARL LAGRANGE
</p>
<p>KELLOGG is NO LONGER UNDER THE BAN.
