<p>* "A Convention of Citizens of the State of New York, * * * held at Rochester, * * * to devise measures
</p>
<p>to RESCUE THE CANALS FROM THE RUIN WITH WHICH THEY ARE THREATENED," says the
</p>
<p>Editor of the New York Herald, August 31, 1859.
</p>
<p>t "The Railroad Interest has blundered a premature charge upon the Canals," says the New York Daily Times,
</p>
<p>edited by Ex-Lieutenant Governor Raymond. * * * "Fortunate, then, for the State, was this premature
</p>
<p>publication of the Railroad Conspiracy," continues the Daily Times of Sept. 3d. " The announcement rallied
</p>
<p>the Friends of the Canals at an auspicious moment. Had the alarm been given a week later, the political
</p>
<p>conventions might have ignored the whole question, and at least a year would have been lost. But, now,
</p>
<p>this is impossible." * * * "How wisely the (Rochester) Convention has performed its delicate and important duties, may be seen by our report of its proceedings."-(N. Y. Times, Sept. 3, 1859.)
</p>
<p>$ "It is proposed to sell the Canals," says the New York Tribune. "A sale, even of the Internal Improvements of
</p>
<p>the State, is not necessarily objectionable; but it happens, in this case, unfortunately, that the proposition to
</p>
<p>sell comes from those, or the friends of those, who wish to buty."-(N. Y. Tribune, Sept. 5.)

</p>
<p>"Even if we granted-which we do not for a moment-that the Canals are likely to prove a bad property," continues the New York Tribune, "we contend that the worst possible thing we could do with them would be to
</p>
<p>part with them, when an absolute and demonstrable certainty exists that THEY WOULD BE USED AS A
</p>
<p>MIGHTY INSTRUMENT FOR THE POLITICAL AND PECUNIARY OPPRESSION OF THE PEOPLE AT
</p>
<p>LARGE."-(N. Y. Tribune, Sept. 5.)
</p>
<p>"Do the Canals tas the Treasury? Persistent and apparently concerted efforts are now making all over the State,
</p>
<p>to convince the People that the Canals are a dead-weight upon the Treasury, and that their retention by the
</p>
<p>Commonwealth will involve the necessity of direct taxation for their support. 1
</p>
<p>A more UNFOUNDED
</p>
<p>ABSURDITY (says the New York Times) WAS NEVER PUT FORTH by a knot of FINANCIAL CONSPIRATORS bent upon HOODWINKING THE PUBLIC MIND." * * * * "The truth is (says the Editor
</p>
<p>of the Times) that THE CANALS, instead of being burdensome and unproductive, are actually at this moment BETTER PROPERTY TIAN ANY RAILWAY IN THE STATE."-New York Times.
</p>
<p>" The place which they (the Canals) fill in our system of internal communication is one which no railway can
</p>
<p>supply, and in which they are not likely to meet the competition of new Canals. Nobody dreams of abolishing them. Were the State to be dragooned into selling them to-morrow, we should have the same men gambling in their stock, before a month was past, who now make the vast properties of the Railways the sport
</p>
<p>of their speculations; and all that is required to make the public sentiment of the Commonwealth thoroughly
</p>
<p>alive to their importance, is, to set the facts of their history clearly and honestly forth."-N. Y. Tribune.
</p>
<p>" The prosperity of the State depends, to a certain degree, upon its traffic; its traffic must, in a large measure, be
</p>
<p>carried on through ITS CANALS, which BELONG TO THE PEOPLE; the people, therefore, will directly,
</p>
<p>as well as indirectly, enjoy the fruit of their own prosperity. Secondly: ALL MONOPOLIES ARE HOSTILE
</p>
<p>TO THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE. To throw into the same hands both the Railroads and the Canals
</p>
<p>of the State, would be to give to private individuals the monopoly of all its internal transportation, and the
</p>
<p>power greatly to oppress the people. It is wise and best, therefore, to avoid the creation of such a monopoly,
</p>
<p>by keeping the Canals in the possession of the State, and under the control of the people themselves."New York Tribune.

<p>NEW YORK:-PRINTED FOR THE CLINTON LEAGUE, BY BAKER &'GODWIN.'C'9Q ER, 1859,
</p>
<p>REPORT TO THE CLINTON LEAGUE,
</p>
<p>INCLUDING PROCEEDINGS OF
</p>
<p>CONVENTIONS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
</p>
<p>(AT ROCHESTER AND UTICA) CONCERNING THE
</p>
<p>Canal System, Railway Management, and State Interests Generally.
</p>
<p>IN addition to the " Brief Report," and other documents issued recently concerning the objects of the Rochester
</p>
<p>STATE CONVENTION, and the motives of the New York Meetings in sending Delegates to that Convention, the undersigned, Chairman and Secretary (of those Meetings (known as the " CLINTON LEAGUE for Promoting the Completion of
</p>
<p>the Canal System"), now respectfully present a FULL REPORT of the Proceedings of that Convention, and also of the
</p>
<p>Utica Convention, printed from the statement of the phonographers employed for that purpose, in accordance with
</p>
<p>the views of the meetings above mentioned.
</p>
<p>This FULL REPORT embodies an amount of statistics and other facts, with expositions of Canal and Railway Operations, which make it well worthy of preservation for reference, in connection with present controversies, and with
</p>
<p>the future policy of the State concerning the Commercial, Agricultural, and Manufacturing Interests of the whole
</p>
<p>community.
</p>
<p>As the Rochester Convention reiterated the doctrines of the Syracuse Convention on the same subjects, the
</p>
<p>Address of the latter body is included as an Appendix in this pamphlet.
</p>
<p>The Addresses of the Syracuse and Rochester Conventions-the first, written by Dr. S. B. HUNT, of Buffalo, and
</p>
<p>the latter by ANSEL BAScoM, Esq., of Seneca Falls,-with the letters of Gov. HUNT, Gov. BOUCK, the Hon. SAMUEL
</p>
<p>B. RUGGLES. and other matters, such as the speech of Gen. ADAMS, and the statements of Messrs. JAMES L. BARTON
</p>
<p>GEO. R. BABCOCK, and CARLOS COBB, of Buffalo, should be widely circulated and carefully considered; as should,
</p>
<p>also, the speeches of Ex-speaker ALVORD and Ex-speaker LITTLEJOHN, and of Mr. CROCKER, of Oswego, and Mr.
</p>
<p>lHovEY. of Syracuse, in the Utica Convention, concerning the abuses of the Railway System, and the policy of the
</p>
<p>Canal Enlargement, and concerning also particularly a Pro-Rata Law, for correcting the enormous evils resulting
</p>
<p>from that pernicious discriminating Railway poiicy" whereby the people of this State are victimized in "the Railroad Conspiracy, (as the New York Times calls it), for discrediting the Canals and diminishing their Revenues, with
</p>
<p>a view of bringing them under the hammer."
</p>
<p>The Address from the undersigned, included in this pamphlet, briefly indicates the general views which prompted
</p>
<p>the New York Meetings to send Delegates to the Rochester and Utica Conventions, and which now stimulate the
</p>
<p>CLINTON LEAGUE to continued effort for " promoting the completion of the Canal System."
</p>
<p>The foregoing matters have been printed in compact form, for general circulation-as presenting briefly the
</p>
<p>essential points in discussion.
</p>
<p>A few extracts from leading newspapers have been added-from the Herald, Tinzes, and Tribune-indicating
</p>
<p>the effect produced by the movements connected with the objects for which the Rochester State Convention was
</p>
<p>assembled. Attention is specially invited to these editorials. The necessity for that Convention, and its importance
</p>
<p>in arousing ALL PARTIES, are briefly and forcibly exemplified in the editorial remarks quoted in this connection
</p>
<p>from those influentialjournals. (Vide pages 3, 4, and 5.)
</p>
<p>As one of the New York papers, however, stated that the recent movements concerning the Canal System are
</p>
<p>uncalled-for assumptions of power by unauthorized persons, and as this statement has been copied by some other
</p>

</p>
<p>papers, it may be proper to state that the meetings in New York which appointed Delegates to the Rochester and Utica
</p>
<p>Conventions, included men who wrote and sustained the first memorials anrd resolutions in the original movements (a
</p>
<p>quarter-century ago) for Enlarging the Erie Canal-with men who have been life-long connected with the Commerce of
</p>
<p>New York and the Western States men representing Transportation Companies which annually transact a larger
</p>
<p>business between the Atlantic and the Interior States than all the "great Railroad Companies" of the United States
</p>
<p>put together. (Vide Proceedings of Clinton League, page 5.)
</p>
<p>It will be seen that the views of the CLINTON LEAGIUE-about questions to candidates-for a Pro-Rata Law, but
</p>
<p>against reimposing Tolls on railroad freight,-and also against separate partisan organization or expression of preferces fr candidates-bave met with general approval. The proceedings of the State Executive Committee, the day
</p>
<p>after the State Convention at Utica. are particularly worthy of notice on these points. (Vide pages 5 and 6 )
</p>
<p>Inaccuracies of newspaper telegraph reports, published in the daily papers nearly everywhere in the State, will be
</p>
<p>noticed on comparison of those telegrams with the Report published by the Editor of the Utica Morning Herald, as
</p>
<p>well as with the Report of the phonographers published in this pamphlet. One only of these inaccurcacies will be
</p>
<p>here mentioned, and this particularly concerns an important subject on which the New York delegates were specially
</p>
<p>instructed, namely, against separate partisan organization up)on the Canal ques ion. The Associated Press reports in this City and throughout the State, (as far as we have seen), state that resolutions "providng." among other
</p>
<p>things, "for committees to conduct the Legislative elections, were adopted." T his is utterly incorrect. No such
</p>
<p>object was avowed, and no such committee was apppointed bv the Convention. On the contrary, the opinion of the
</p>
<p>Convention, like the opinion previously expressed by the Clinton League in New Yrk, (as stated by the undersigned
</p>
<p>in that Convention), was ilnanimously opposed to partisan organization-rtliance being placed on the' success of appeals to thec good sense of all parties, alter proper questions propounded to the candidates of all parties.
</p>
<p>The Replies of Candidates are printed in the order of reception by us. All answered waho wuere questioned.
</p>
<p>The replies were printed in the order of reception, and furnished in the same order t, editors and reporters who
</p>
<p>desired copies. The last of these replies was not received till the 11th October; and this Report, including all the
</p>
<p>correspondence with candidates for State Offices, is printed on the following (lay (12th October). ST All the
</p>
<p>rieplies are favorable to the views exprvestsed ly tlhe Clinton Leyague, as presented in the questions, and approved
</p>
<p>by the Execultive Conlmmittee of the State (onventions of the Friends of the Canal System. (Vide pages 5, 6, 7, &c.)
</p>
<p>With this statement. it is scarcely necessary to add, that no delegate or member of this League had any concern in
</p>
<p>telegraphing the reply of any one candidate (to the exclusion of others) to newspapers throughout the State.
</p>
<p>The recent declarations of the several political State Conventions-the avowals of candidates nominated by all
</p>
<p>parties for State Offices. in reply to tlie interr(ogatories propounded by this Association-indicate that the MORAL
</p>
<p>INFLUENCE of the CLINTON LEAGUE can be exerted more pwertully in appealing to the GOOD SENSE OF ALI
</p>
<p>PARTIES AN D ALL CANDII)ATES, than in separate partisan organization.
</p>
<p>As several members of the Delegation appointed in New York were unable to attend the Conventions, it is
</p>
<p>proper to add that "the names of the Delegates were all used authoritatively; and that, if not pre-ent in person, al
</p>
<p>were there in spirit." as stated by one of the Delegates in the Convention. The extent to which that spirit was mani
</p>
<p>fested may be inferred from the letter of the lion. SAMUEL B. RUGGLES. the chief of the Delegation, whose absence

</p>
<p>partisan organization or the expression of preferences among candidates, were unani2nously approved; and the following resolutions were adopted in accordance with the sentiments of the meeting: 
</p>
<p>Resolved, That the interrogatories propounded to the several nominees of all parties for State offices, by the
</p>
<p>Chairman and Secretary of this Association, be accepted and approved, as embodying all the points which this
</p>
<p>League considers essential for promoting the cause at the present time; that the said interrogatories, with all replies

<p>that may be received, be reported to the State Executive Committee, and be published for the information of people
</p>
<p>qf all parties, concerning the views ot the candidates of all parties touching the Canal and Railway questions now
</p>
<p>before the people of the State of New York.
</p>
<p>Resolved also, That, in the opinion of this Association, it is INEXPEDIENT TO REIMPOSE TOLLS UPON RAILROADS,
</p>
<p>or to advocate such policy; though, as a matter of right and justice, it is highly equitable towards the tax-payers of the
</p>
<p>State that the freight passing through the State over our Canals and Railways should contribute to paying off the
</p>
<p>Public Debt, created for aiding those improvements.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That the delegates named by this Association, who may attend the State Convention, at Utica, on the
</p>
<p>2Sth Sept, be instructed to oppose all attempts to nominate State officers, or otherwise to engage this Association
</p>
<p>in any partisan operations.
</p>
<p>Resolved, That the next meeting of this League be held when the Chairman and Secretary can submit printed
