</p>
<p>PREFATORY.
</p>
<p>In his valuable work on the "Cession of Louisiana," published
</p>
<p>in the first years of this century, Allen B. Magruder stated : " To
</p>
<p>whiytever incomprehensible spirit of delirium the circumstances
</p>
<p>may have attributed its origin, yet it is a fact, that about the year
</p>
<p>1789, or 1790, a plan was in agitation to separate Kentucky from
</p>
<p>the Union and attach it to the Spanish government of Louisiana,
</p>
<p>A memorial was drawn up addressed to the executive authority of
</p>
<p>the colony expressing the advantage of a union, which was recipro-
</p>
<p>cated in the same terms on the part of the Simnish governor. The
</p>
<p>chimerical plan proceeded so far in its effects upon the public
</p>
<p>mind, that a proposition to form the state into an independent gov-
</p>
<p>ernment was introduced into a convention held about that time
</p>
<p>to form articles of separation from the State of Virginia." The
</p>
<p>author of the book in which this statement was made was at the
</p>
<p>time a resident of Lexington, Ky. He was a staunch Republican
</p>
<p>and an intimate political and personal associate of the men to
</p>
<p>whom the movement in question was attributed ; and, writing soon
</p>
<p>after its occurrence, his opportunities for correctly ascertaining the
</p>
<p>facts from the men who were fully acquainted therewith were most
</p>
<p>ample.
</p>
<p>A few years after this publication was made by Magruder, an
</p>
<p>exposure of the plan to which he had referred was made, in 1806,
</p>
<p>in the columns of the "Tlie Western World," a newspaper published

</p>
<p>at Frankfort, Ky. As an effect of that exposure, John Brown,
</p>
<p>one of the principals engaged in the plan, deemed it expedient at
</p>
<p>the early age of forty-eight to retire forever from public life, and,
</p>
<p>as far as possible, to withdraw himself from public observation ;
</p>
<p>while Sebastian, his friend and one of his coadjutors, was driven
</p>
<p>in merited disgrace from the bench of the Court of Appeals. The
</p>
<p>legislative investigation which was forced by that exposure, and
</p>
<p>the results of the judicial inquiries which he had himself invoked,
</p>
<p>left the unhappy Innes, another of John Brown's associates in the
</p>
<p>plan, nothing of which to boast and every thing to most bitterly
</p>
<p>lament. And, though a " Scotch verdict" of acquittal was given
</p>
<p>to James Wilkinson, the prime mover and leader in the plan, by
</p>
<p>the coiirt-martial which was organized for the purpose, yet his own
</p>
<p>letters, since obtained from the Spanish archives, establish the
</p>
<p>indubitable truth of the charges made against him, and no one
</p>
<p>now questions his guilt.
</p>
<p>At a later day, but during the lives of these men, not only were
</p>
<p>the charges as to their participation in this j^lan distinctly formu-
</p>
<p>lated, but the evidence to sustain them was stated in detail and
</p>
<p>passed into history. The historians who afterward wrote upon the
</p>
<p>subject accepted and reproduced that statement as a correct repre-
</p>
<p>sentation of the facts. Butler, who wrote in defense of these men
</p>
<p>in 1834, and who had had the fullest opportunity for obtaining every
</p>
<p>fact within their possession which in the slightest degree contradicted
</p>
<p>the allegations under which they had suffered ;  even Butler was
</p>
<p>obliged to confess, "that Mr. Brown, and in all probability many
</p>
<p>other of the ancient statesmen of Kentucky, did incline to discuss,
</p>
<p>if not adopt, a connexion with Spain, independent of the feeble and
</p>
<p>disgraced union, which then existed ;" and to protest that the sug-
</p>
<p>gestion, that the letters of Brown which communicated the over-

</p>
<p>other than to " forwar(J information," was " unworthy of the grave
</p>
<p>subject of communication," and of the " dignity of the correspond-
</p>
<p>ents;" and was " inconsistent with the only manly and triumphant
</p>
<p>justification of which," the zealous champion of treason thought,
</p>
<p>" the measure may have been susceptible." The historians being thus
</p>
<p>substantially agreed upon the facts, differed only as to the degree of
</p>
<p>turpitude they involved. Had the question been permitted to re-
</p>
<p>main one as to whether the sly plotting of treason was reprehensi-
</p>
<p>ble or commendable, there had been no necessity of now recurring
</p>
<p>to the subject.
</p>
<p>But, more than a century after the events had occurred,
</p>
<p>half a century after the last of those who participated in the con-
</p>
<p>troversy and the scenes to which it had related had been buried ;
</p>
<p> and after many years of patient labor expended in devising
</p>
<p>ways by which facts could be so suppressed, and misstatements of
</p>
<p>other facts could be so invented ^nd systematized, as to make his
</p>
<p>ancestor's conduct appear to be not only blameless, but actually
</p>
<p>patriotic, the late Colonel John Mason Brown succeeded in accom-
</p>
<p>plishiug that result in a manner satisfactory to himself, in the
</p>
<p>preparation, reading, and placing in the hands of the printer of a
</p>
<p>paper entitled "T/ie Political Beginnings, of Kentucky.'" This paper
</p>
<p>was not published until some months after its author's death. In
</p>
<p>its efforts to conceal John Brown's guilt, it flatly contradicts state-
</p>
<p>ments which were made on John Brown's own authority. Protest-
</p>
<p>ing that Butler, who endeavored to apologize for John Brown, had
</p>
<p>blindly accepted, and without an examination reproduced state-
</p>
<p>ments to his grievous injury, which had emanated in malice, the
</p>
<p>author of " The Political Beginnings" asserts, that the " so-called
</p>
<p>Spanish Conspiracy, gloomily imagined as concocted with Gardoqui,
</p>
<p>was but a figment of an incensed political adversary's brain ; a

<p>suspicion unsupported by a particle of testimony, unvouched for by

</p>
<p>documeut, unestablished by deposition, and refuted by every proof."
</p>
<p>The book claims to produce evideuce discovered by its author,
</p>
<p>which furnishes, as it alleges, the complete vindication of John
</p>
<p>Brown;  a vindication, it may be remarked, which the prudent
</p>
<p>Brown never sought for himself, which no one else was ever able to
</p>
<p>offer for him, but which, if it were possible that he were really in-
</p>
<p>nocent, it must be admitted his memory for more tlian fifty years
</p>
<p>has most sorely needed. The author thus reopens the entire sub-
</p>
<p>ject, boldly challenges the world to weigh tlie alleged evidence, to
</p>
<p>pronounce upon its sufficiency, and to criticise the integrity of its
</p>
<p>presentation.
</p>
<p>The writer had taken great interest in that remarkable epoch in
</p>
<p>the history of his native state. His acquaintance with the facts
</p>
<p>was, however, but limited. He wished to ascertain hi)w far the
</p>
<p>astonishing statements which are made in "The Political Begin-
</p>
<p>nings," and which had arrested" his attention, were sustained by
</p>
<p>the testimony cited ; whether it were possible that all others had
</p>
<p>been in error, and that Colonel Brown alone had unearthed the facts.
</p>
<p>He therefore entered upon an investigation of the facts connected
</p>
<p>witb that singular episode in our history ; upon the inquiry to wliich
</p>
<p>the whole world had been invited and summoned with such blare
</p>
<p>of trumpets. The results of that inquiry are now placed before
</p>
<p>the public.
</p>
<p>In these pages are produced, in their logical connection and
</p>
<p>relation to each other, the proofs known to the writer, which show
</p>
<p>that, while Kentucky was yet a district of Virginia, an engage-
</p>
<p>ment was entered into by James Wilkinson with Miro, the Intend-
</p>
<p>aut of Louisiana, to separate Kentucky from the United States,
</p>
<p>and to subject her people to Spain; that, as a result of this in-
</p>
<p>trigue between Wilkinson and Miro, a proposition was, a few

<p>United States, to John Brown, then a member of the Old Con-
</p>
<p>gress from Virginia, to grant to the people of Kentucky the privi-
</p>
<p>lege of navigating the Mississippi, which Spain refused to the peo-
</p>
<p>ple of the United States, on condition that the people of Kentucky
</p>
<p>would first erect themselves into an independent state and with-
</p>
<p>draw from the Union ; that John Brown, assenting to the propo-
</p>
<p>sition made to him by the representative of the government of
</p>
<p>Torquemada, promised to aid the design ; that, in accordance with
</p>
<p>the engagement made by the one and the assurance given by the
</p>
<p>other, Wilkinson and Brown, on their return to Kentucky, con-
</p>
<p>spired with each other, and with Benjamin Sebastian, Harry Innes,
</p>
<p>Caleb Wallace, Isaac Dunn, and others, to accomplish the separa-
</p>
<p>tion which had been concerted with the Spaniards, did all that<
</p>
<p>they dared do to bring it about, and that their movements in
</p>
<p>the Danville Conventions of July and November, 1788, which
</p>
<p>were so happily frustrated, were agreed upon, and directed to that
</p>
<p>end. It will be shown that in this movement, its leader, Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son, was not actuated by a desire to promote the growth of the
</p>
<p>West by obtaining for the people the freedom of the navigation of
</p>
<p>the Mississippi. On the contrary, it will be shown that the motives
</p>
<p>for his treason were at once wholly mercenary, selfish, and per-
</p>
<p>fidious ; that, while he bargained for the exclusive privilege of trade
</p>
<p>with New Orleans for himself and his associates, he urged upon
</p>
<p>the Spanish authorities that the rigid occlusion of the Mississippi as
</p>
<p>against all others, was the sole means by which the people of Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky could be tempted or driven to a separation from the United
</p>
<p>States, that they might thereby obtain, through an alliance with
</p>
<p>Spain, a right which that power denied to them while they re-
</p>
<p>mained a part of the United States.

<p>their own defense, which they procured to be written, paid for, pub-
</p>
<p>lished, and circulated, and vouched for to the public to whose sym-
</p>
<p>pathies they aj^pealed, and whom they attempted to deceive. In
</p>
<p>treating those tergiversations it is assumed that innocence does not
</p>
<p>need, and never resorts to, fraud and falsehood for its vindication ;
</p>
<p>and that, if positive evidence were as wanting as in this case it is
</p>
<p>abundant, among the most indubitable manifestations of conscious
</p>
<p>guilt are the subterfuges, concealments, prevarications, and delib-
</p>
<p>erate departures from truth behind which that guilt ever seeks a
</p>
<p>refuge. If these propositions be true, as their natural consequence
</p>
<p>it folloAvs, as surely as the night succeeds the day, that the author
</p>
<p>who, in the advocacy of any cause or in the defense of any man,
</p>
<p>systematically conceals material facts, suppresses important testi-
</p>
<p>mony which conflicts with his own positions, and deliberately makes
</p>
<p>statements which the very evidence he cites disproves  not in one
</p>
<p>or two instances only, but from his initial to his concluding chap-
</p>
<p>ter,  thereby discloses his own seuse of the wrongful nature of that
</p>
<p>cause, and makes manifest his own knowledge or conviction of the
</p>
<p>guilt of the man whose cause he had espoused.
</p>
<p>Without further explanations, the writer now confidently sub-
</p>
<p>mits the facts and the evidence to the calm and unbiased scrutiny,
</p>
<p>and to the just and inexorable judgment, of all men who take an
</p>
<p>interest in the early history of our common country, who value
</p>
<p>honor in our public servants, and who insist that due respect shall
</p>
<p>be paid to historic truth.

</p>
<p>The peace of 1763, which followed the triumph of Brit-
</p>
<p>ish arms over the allied forces of French and Indians,
</p>
<p>secured to the Court of St. James the territorial sover-
</p>
<p>eignty of all the country east of the Mississippi to which
</p>
<p>France had previously asserted the right of dominion.
</p>
<p>But prior to the signing of the definitive treaty with Great
</p>
<p>Britain, and contemporaneously with signing the prelim-
</p>
<p>inary articles of agreement with that power, on the 3d
</p>
<p>of November, 1762, France, apprehending that her terri-
</p>
<p>tory of Louisiana might fall into the hands of Great
</p>
<p>Britain, had, by a secret treaty, made a free gift of all that
</p>
<p>splendid domain to Spain. The apparent generosity of
</p>
<p>this voluntary cession of the magnificent territory west
</p>
<p>of the Mississippi was somewhat diminished by the fact,
</p>
<p>that it had steadily proved a burden and expense rather
</p>
<p>than a benefit or source of revenue to the French king ;
</p>
<p>and Spain was by no means greedy for the prize thus ten-
</p>
<p>dered as a proof of friendship and confidence and to con-
</p>
<p>ciliate her good will. However, the gift was finally ac-
</p>
<p>cepted by his Catholic majesty, not for its own intrinsic
</p>
<p>value so much as with the expectation that Louisiana
</p>
<p>would interpose a barrier between the British dominions
</p>
<p>and his own more valued provinces of Texas and Mexico.
</p>
<p>Spain did not formally take possession of this fair and
</p>
<p>imperial domain until 1769, when, with great pomp and

</p>
<p>sleepy village of New Orleans.
</p>
<p>Tlie definitive treaty of Paris, which restored peace be-
</p>
<p>tween Great Britain and her colonies und France and
</p>
<p>Spain, was signed on the 10th of Februar3% 1763. By its
</p>
<p>provisions France surrendered and ceded to Great Britain
</p>
<p>not only her chiims to the country south of the lakes and
</p>
<p>east of the Mississippi, but also Canada, Nova Scotia, the
</p>
<p>island of Cape Breton, and all the other islands and coasts
</p>
<p>in the gulf and river of St. Lawrence. The seventh article
</p>
<p>of that treaty, out of which, and its alleged conflict with
</p>
<p>the previous secret gift of Louisiana to Spain, grew many of
</p>
<p>the difficulties which accompanied subsequent negotiations
</p>
<p>between the United States and Spain, was as follows, viz :
</p>
<p>Article 7. " In order to establish peace on solid and durable
</p>
<p>foundations, and to remove forever all subjects of dispute with re-
</p>
<p>gard to the limits of the British and French territories on the con-
</p>
<p>tinent of America, it is agreed that for the future, the confines
</p>
<p>between the dominions of his Britannic Majesty and those of his
</p>
<p>most Christian Majesty in that part of the world, shall be fixed ir-
</p>
<p>revocably by a line drawn along the middle of the Mississippi
</p>
<p>river, from its source to the river Iberville, and from thence by a
</p>
<p>line drawn along the middle of this river, and the lakes Maurepas
</p>
<p>and Poutchartrain, to the sea; and for this purpose, tlie most
</p>
<p>Christian king cedes, in full right, and guarantees to his Britannic
</p>
<p>Majesty, the river and port of Mobile, and every thing which he
</p>
<p>possesses or ought to pos^3ess on the left side of the river Mississippi,
</p>

</p>
<p>As by the cession of all the territory owned by France
</p>
<p>on the east of the Mississippi, Great Britain had thus be-

</p>
<p>come possessed of the left bank of that river from its
</p>
<p>source to its mouth, the express provision in regard to its
</p>
<p>navigation conveyed only a right which would necessarily
</p>
<p>have accompanied the territory ceded, according to all the
</p>
<p>laws of nations. It will be understood that the prior grant
</p>
<p>of Louisiana to Spain was as yet a secret and had not been
</p>
<p>accepted. The rights reserved to France were those which
</p>
<p>had been already given to Spain, which afterward took the
</p>
<p>place of France in the dominion over Louisiana.
</p>
<p>Spanish authority over Louisiana had been scarcely as-
</p>
<p>sumed by O'Reilly, in 1769, when, owing to an increase of
</p>
<p>population by reason of the regiments which came with
</p>
<p>him, a dearth of provisions in New Orleans became so ex-
</p>
<p>cessive that flour rose to $20 per barrel. In the midst of
</p>
<p>the general distress a Philadelphian, named Oliver Pol-
</p>
<p>lock, arrived from Baltimore with a brig laden with flour,
</p>
<p>which he offered to O'Reilly on his own terms. Declining
</p>
<p>to accept this generous offer, the Spanish governor finally
</p>
<p>purchased the cargo at $15 per barrel ; and a promise was
</p>
<p>made to Pollock that he should have free trade to Lou-
</p>
<p>isiana so long as he lived, and that a report of his conduct
</p>
<p>should be made to the king.* In 1776, this same Oliver
</p>
<p>Pollock was in IsTeW Orleans, with other merchants from
</p>
<p>Philadelphia, Ncav York, and Boston, and by their exer-
</p>
<p>tions and enterprise was procured the abundant supply of
</p>
<p>ammunition, which was delivered to Colonel John Gibson,
</p>
<p>and was conveyed by him to Pittsburg for the use of the
</p>
<p>Americans. It was a part of this powder which George
</p>
<p>Rogers Clark obtained from Virginia in the fall of that
</p>
<p>year and shipped to Cabin Creek, for the use of the Ken-
</p>
<p>* Martin's History of Louisiana, page 210. Concerning this gentleman,
</p>
<p>General Wilkinson wrote (in the second volume of his Memoirs, page
</p>
<p>150): "It is notorious to every ancient inhabitant of Louisiana, that
</p>
<p>Mr. Pollock's connection with the Spanish officers, at New Orleans, was

</p>
<p>the most intimate, and his influence boundless fro7n the administration
</p>
<p>of General O'Reilly to that of Governor Miro, from the year 1769 to 1790."
</p>
<p>AVhile Wilkinson exaggerated this intimacy and influence, in order to
</p>
<p>magnify the importance of Pollock's testimony that he had no informa-
</p>
<p>tion of Wilkinson's pension from the Spaniards, yet it is certain the one
</p>
<p>was unusual and the other great.

</p>
<p>tuckians. Spain, like France, being inimical to Great
</p>
<p>Britain, and desiring the separation of her colonies from
</p>
<p>her, Galvez, then the Spanish governor, connived at the
</p>
<p>sale of ammunition to Pollock and his associates, though
</p>
<p>his government was ostensibly at peace with King George.*
</p>
<p>The next year several large boats came from Pittsburg to
</p>
<p>New Orleans, and returned laden with munitions, which
</p>
<p>Pollock had collected at the latter place. f An active cor-
</p>
<p>respondence was maintained between Galvez and Colonel
</p>
<p>George Morgan, who was in command at Fort Pitt, who
</p>
<p>meditated a descent to l^ew Orleans, and who contem-
</p>
<p>plated an attack from that point on Mobile and Pensacola ;
</p>
<p>but this was discouraged by Galvez, who had his eye on
</p>
<p>the Floridas as a part of the futui-e spoil of Spain, and had
</p>
<p>no purpose to permit them to be taken by the Americans.
</p>
<p>In 1778, Pollock openly assumed the character of agent
</p>
<p>for the United States at New Orleans ; and, the court of
</p>
<p>Madrid having become less timid in its manifestations of
</p>
<p>hostility to Great Britain, Galvez gave assistance to the
</p>
<p>Americans, in arms, ammunition, provisions, etc., to the
</p>
<p>amount of $70,000,  all of which, with large quantities
</p>
<p>bought by his own means, was sent by Pollock to the in-
</p>
<p>habitants of Western Pennsylvania, of Kentucky, of the
</p>
<p>Watauga, and to the posts captured from the British on
</p>
<p>the Mississippi. From New Orleans, and largely from
</p>
<p>Pollock, came the supplies which enabled Clark to cap-
</p>
<p>ture Vincennes and Kaskaskia.J Thence was equipped
</p>
<p>the predatory foray of Captain Willing on the British set-
</p>
<p>tlers of Natchez. In a word, every important military
</p>
<p>movement in the west was aided from New Orleans, Oliver
</p>
<p>Pollock being, in nearly every case, one of the leading
</p>
<p>factors by whom the supplies were furnished. Thus was
</p>
<p>the attention of the scattered settlers west of the mount-
</p>
<p>ains early drawn to the vast importance to them of the

<p>the gulf; and while the traders at Pittsburg ascertained
</p>
<p>that their easiest and cheapest route for freights to and
</p>
<p>from Philadelphia was by way of Kew Orleans, the inhab-
</p>
<p>itants of the entire west were made to feel that their nat-
</p>
<p>ural outlet to the markets of the world was through the
</p>
<p>mouths of the Mississippi.
</p>
<p>The Treaty of 1763 had constituted the Mississippi as
</p>
<p>the western boundary of North Carolina. But, by pro-
</p>
<p>clamation bearing date the 7th of October, 1763, King
</p>
<p>George had prohibited the granting of " warrants of
</p>
<p>survey," or the " passing of patents," or the settlement of
</p>
<p>" any lands beyond the heads or sources of any of the
</p>
<p>rivers which fall into the Atlantic ocean from the west or
</p>
<p>northwest ; "  a measure deemed necessary for quieting
</p>
<p>the fears and jealousies of the red men, and which did
</p>
<p>much toward destroying the combinations of Pontiac.
</p>
<p>A compliance with this mandate would have prevented the
</p>
<p>extension of the frontier settlements west of the mount-
</p>
<p>ains of ITorth Carolina ; but, in defiance of the prohibi-
</p>
<p>tion, a considerable number of the hardy and restless
</p>
<p>woodsmen and pioneers of that province, had early estab-
</p>
<p>lished themselves upon the banks of the Watauga, one of
</p>
<p>the tributaries of the Holston, where they were quickly
</p>
<p>joined by adventurous spirits from Virginia, Maryland
</p>
<p>and Pennsylvania. Their numbers had so rapidly in-
</p>
<p>creased that, in 1776, their claim to representation in the
</p>
<p>convention which framed the constitution for the " state "
</p>
<p>of ]S^orth Carolina was admitted ; and their aggressive dis-
</p>
<p>position had so extended the area of their occupation
</p>
<p>that, in 1777, they were formed into a county of North
</p>
<p>Carolina, which had the Mississippi as its western bound-
</p>
<p>ary ; thus early planting the flag upon and carrying the
</p>
<p>dominion and laws of the United States to the banks of
</p>
<p>that mighty stream.

<p>The recognition by France of the independence of
</p>
<p>and conclusion of a treaty of alliance and commerce with
</p>
<p>the United States, was answered by an immediate declara-
</p>
<p>tion of war against France by Great Britain. To the
</p>
<p>treaty between France and the United States was annexed
</p>
<p>14 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>a secret article, reserving to Spain the right of acceding
</p>
<p>thereto, and of participating in its stipulations whenever
</p>
<p>she might think proper. The offered mediation by Spain
</p>
<p>having been rejected by the Court of St. James, his Cath-
</p>
<p>olic majesty, uniting w^ith his kinsman of France in the
</p>
<p>struggle, on the 8th of May, 1779, published his formal
</p>
<p>declaration of war against Great Britain. The Spanish
</p>
<p>expeditions against Fort Manchac, Baton Rouge and
</p>
<p>Natchez were accompanied by Oliver Pollock, as the agent
</p>
<p>of the American Congress. The Floridas having remained
</p>
<p>faithful to Great Britain, the Spanish arms were soon di-
</p>
<p>rected against Mobile and Pensacola, which fell into their
</p>
<p>hands. Witnessing with the most lively satisfaction the
</p>
<p>rupture between Spain and Great Britain, Congress
</p>
<p>deemed it advisable to invite his Catholic majesty^ to avail
</p>
<p>himself of the secret provision in their treaty with France,
</p>
<p>and for this purpose resolved to send a minister plenipo-
</p>
<p>tentiary to Madrid ; and, on the 27th of September, 1779,
</p>
<p>selected John Jay, then the able Chief Justice of ]S"ew
</p>
<p>York, for that most important mission. To this distin-
</p>
<p>guished gentleman it had been frequently intimated by
</p>
<p>M. Gerard, the French minister at Philadelphia, prior to
</p>
<p>the embarcation in the war by Spain, that an indispen-
</p>
<p>sable prerequisite to a treaty with his Catholic majesty
</p>
<p>would be a quitting of the Floridas and of the Mississippi
</p>
<p>to him ; but when Mr. Jay accepted the mission to Madrid,
</p>
<p>he had become fully " persuaded that we ought not to cede
</p>
<p>to her (Spain) any of our rights, and of course that we
</p>
<p>should retain and insist upon our right to the navigation
</p>
<p>of the Mississippi." *
</p>
<p>On the fourth day after his arrival in Cadiz, in the
</p>
<p>Spring of 1780, Mr. Jay sent his secretary to Madrid, with
</p>
<p>a letter to the Spanish minister for foreign affairs, ac-
</p>
<p>quainting him with the commission with which he was

<p>charged. The answer invited Mr. Jay to Madrid, but

<p>plainly intimated that he was not expected to assume a

</p>
<p>formal character, which must depend on future acknowl-
</p>
<p>edgment and treaty ;  thus giving him to understand, at
</p>
<p>the very outset, that an acknowledgment of American
</p>
<p>independence by Spain would, on her part, be made a
</p>
<p>matter of bargain, and that she expected to be paid for
</p>
<p>admitting a fact, however indisputable ;  and it was
</p>
<p>equally apparent to him that whatever designs were enter-
</p>
<p>tained by Spain were not only countenanced, but, in some
</p>
<p>instances, were even prompted by the French ambassador
</p>
<p>at Madrid. He was also soon given to understand that the
</p>
<p>claims of the United States to the navigation of the Mis-
</p>
<p>sissippi prevented Spain from forming a treaty with them,
</p>
<p>and, besides, Spain had pretensions as to territory to
</p>
<p>which the patriotic American would not yield. In sub-
</p>
<p>stance, the servants of the Catholic King said to the Am-
</p>
<p>erican minister, whom they refused to recognize: The
</p>
<p>price of our acknowledgment of your independence, and
</p>
<p>of our forming a treaty of alliance and commerce with
</p>
<p>you, is, a subscription on your part to the exclusive right
</p>
<p>of Spain to the navigation of the Mississippi ; your con-
</p>
<p>sent to our taking possession of both the Floridas, and to
</p>
<p>all the country extending from the left bank of the Mis-
</p>
<p>sissippi to the back settlements of the former British pro-
</p>
<p>vinces, according to the proclamation of King George ot
</p>
<p>1763 ; and that you will prohibit your citizens from con-
</p>
<p>quering or settling in any of the British territory to which
</p>
<p>we refer. The plans of Spain were not at all concealed,
</p>
<p>and as little pains were taken to disguise the connivance
</p>
<p>in them by France, whose minister at Philadelphia was in-
</p>
<p>structed to and did communicate them to Congress, in
</p>
<p>terms that sound more like an order than mere advice
</p>
<p>that they be accepted. Mr. Jay declining to accede to
</p>
<p>those conditions, Spain refused to render the financial aid
</p>
<p>to the United States which had been solicited. During

</p>
<p>the year 1780, he labored in vain to induce the Spanish
</p>
<p>Court to enter into negotiations for a treaty. At first,
</p>
<p>Congress was also firm. But, wearied with the struggle,
</p>
<p>in February, 1781, the Virginia delegates in Congress in-
</p>
<p>troduced a resolution, which was voted for by all the
</p>
<p>16 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>soutliern states, with the exception of N'orth Carolina,
</p>
<p>and which passed Congress, instructing him no longer to
</p>
<p>insist upon the navigation of the Mississippi below our
</p>
<p>southern boundary, if it should be found necessary to
</p>
<p>make that concession to obtain a recognition of our inde-
</p>
<p>pendence, and if, by making it, that recognition could be
</p>
<p>obtained. In the meantime, however, in the spring of
</p>
<p>1780,  under the instructions of Gov. Jefferson,  a fort
</p>
<p>named in his honor had been established by George R.
</p>
<p>Clark, below the mouth of the Ohio, upon the Missis-
</p>
<p>sippi. And, on the 2nd of January, 1781, Don Eugenio
</p>
<p>Bierre, at the head of sixty-five Spaniards, set out from
</p>
<p>St. Louis to capture the little mission of St. Joseph on
</p>
<p>Lake Michigan, where he found a few British traders.
</p>
<p>That the place was at once abandoned by the Spaniards,
</p>
<p>who retraced their steps to St. Louis, and that afterwards
</p>
<p>Spain founded on this capture a claim for territorial do-
</p>
<p>minion in the north-west, are evidences that this expedition
</p>
<p>was W'ithout military purpose, and that the enterprise was
</p>
<p>purely a legal one against the rights of the United States.
</p>
<p>Although privately advised of the new instructions
</p>
<p>adopted by Congress, the first official notification of the
</p>
<p>act, which was intensely mortifying to him, was received
</p>
<p>by Mr. Jay when, on the 11th of July, 1781, the Spanish
</p>
<p>secretary of state placed in his hands a letter from the
</p>
<p>president of Congress, announcing the altered resolution
</p>
<p>of that body. Uhder those instructions Mr. Jay, again
</p>
<p>urging the negotiation, presented the Spanish minister with
</p>
<p>the plan of a treaty. In this he had most reluctantly in-
</p>
<p>corporated an article relinquishing the right of the
</p>
<p>United States to the navigation of the Mississippi; but,
</p>
<p>with the courage for which he was remarkable, he made
</p>
<p>this conditional upon the immediate ratification of the
</p>
<p>treaty by Spain, and assumed the responsibility of accom-

<p>panying it by the declaration, that should the treaty not
</p>
<p>be concluded before a general peace, the United States
</p>
<p>were not to be bound by the ofi'erto surrender the naviga-
</p>
<p>tion. But, not content with this humiliating concession,
</p>
<p>Spain refused to enter upon a treaty on any basis other

</p>
<p>than one which, in addition to abandoning this right of
</p>
<p>navigation, and yielding to the Catholic king the posses-
</p>
<p>sion of both the Floridas, should also concede to his
</p>
<p>grasping demands all the territory extending from the left
</p>
<p>bank of the Mississippi to the back settlements of the
</p>
<p>former British provinces, according to the proclamation
</p>
<p>of 1763; and happily, as it turned out, no treaty could be
</p>
<p>effected by Mr. Jay, rior would the Spaniard even enter
</p>
<p>upon a negotiation. Thus, while the revolution was yet
</p>
<p>progressing, did Spain make it apparent that her partici-
</p>
<p>pation in the hostilities against Great Britain was solely
</p>
<p>in order to weaken and humiliate that rival power, for
</p>
<p>her own aggrandizement, and not from any sympathy
</p>
<p>with the cause of American liberty, which was inimical
</p>
<p>to her own institutions ; and thus early did she manifest
</p>
<p>her purpose to separate the west from the east.
</p>
<p>France, which was bound to Spain by compact as
</p>
<p>well as by the close relationship and similar faiths of their
</p>
<p>rulers, united with that power in all her efforts to bring
</p>
<p>the independence of the United States under their protec-
</p>
<p>tion; and to limit our boundaries to the Alleghanies, or at
</p>
<p>the most by the Ohio river. The separation of the Amer-
</p>
<p>ican colonies from Great Britain tending to further the
</p>
<p>objects of France, she labored earnestly and zealously to
</p>
<p>accomplish that result, and was restricted by her own in-
</p>
<p>clinations and interests not less than by compact from
</p>
<p>agreeing to any terms of peace until the independence of
</p>
<p>the United States was secured. But, as the United States
</p>
<p>might possibly prefer claims beyond their independence,
</p>
<p>which Great Britain might be unwilling to concede, it be-
</p>
<p>came important to France to have the power of controlling
</p>
<p>the negotiation of the American claims ;  so as to avoid,
</p>
<p>on the one hand, a breach of her obligations to the United
</p>
<p>States, and, on the other hand, a prolongation of the war for

<p>objects in which she had no interest. And, beyond all this,
</p>
<p>France desired to render the ally in whose behalf she had
</p>
<p>gone into the war, subservient to her interests in the future;
</p>
<p>and she shrewdly calculated that the United States would

</p>
<p>be more easily reduced to the position of a dependent sat-
</p>
<p>ellite of the house of Bourbon, and would be more readily
</p>
<p>controlled by its influence, if the establishment of their
</p>
<p>independence should be attended by the contraction of tlunr
</p>
<p>boundaries, by exclusion from the Gulf of Mexico, and
</p>
<p>from all participation in the fisheries, and by causes for
</p>
<p>permanent irritation with Great Britain, than if erected
</p>
<p>into a powerful empire and reconciled with the mother
</p>
<p>country by a treaty liberal and equitable in its provisions.
</p>
<p>As early as 1779, M. Gerard, the French Minister to tlie
</p>
<p>United States, hinted that the United States might And
</p>
<p>themselves in the j)Osition of the Swiss Cantons, which
</p>
<p>had failed to secure a recognition of their independence
</p>
<p>from their former sovereigns, but nevertheless enjoyed
</p>
<p>"their sovereignty and independence under the guaran-
</p>
<p>tee of France." In the same memorial to Congress,
</p>
<p>M. Gerard adverted to " the manifest necessity of enabling
</p>
<p>Spain, by the determination of just and moderate terms, to
</p>
<p>press upon England with her good offices, and to bring
</p>
<p>her mediation to an issue," which was a hint to Congress
</p>
<p>to recede from its ultimata as to the navigation of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi and a participation in the fisheries. Congress
</p>
<p>then remaining firm, and giving to Mr. Jay a qualified
</p>
<p>reference to the advice of their allies upon points not in-
</p>
<p>cluded in his instructions, the position of the United
</p>
<p>States was found not at all to comport with the views of
</p>
<p>France. Gerard was succeeded as minister to the United
</p>
<p>States by Count Luzerne, wlio, on the 25th of January,
</p>
<p>1780, requested a conference with Congress. The com-
</p>
<p>mittee appointed by Congress to receive his communi-
</p>
<p>cations, reported that the French minister had been
</p>
<p>instructed by his government to inform Congress of cer-
</p>
<p>tain points which were deemed of great importance by
</p>
<p>Spain, which had then taken part in the conflict, an(J

</p>
<p>upon which it was necessary that Congress should ex-
</p>
<p>plicitly explain themselves. These points were identical
</p>
<p>with those which had already been communicated to Mr.
</p>
<p>Jay at Madrid by the Spanish secretary of state, as ob-
</p>
<p>stacles to negotiation by his government with the United

<p>States. They amoLintecl to a demand for an agreement that
</p>
<p>the territory of the United States shoukl extend no fur-
</p>
<p>ther west than the settlements permitted by tlie procUima-
</p>
<p>tion of 1763 ; that the United States thus having no terri-
</p>
<p>tory upon the Mississippi, had no right to navigate that
</p>
<p>stream ; that Spain intended to conquer both the Fhjridas,

<p>and her possession of them must be acquiesced in ; that
</p>
<p>the territory on the east of the Mississippi belonged to
</p>
<p>Great Britain, and would probably be conquered by Spain,
</p>
<p>and the French minister advised Congress to restrain their
</p>
<p>people from conquests or settlements within the territory
</p>
<p>upon which Spain had turned her covetous eyes. Luzerne
</p>
<p>also communicated the information, which partook of the
</p>
<p>nature of a threat, that France did not regard the independ-
</p>
<p>ence of the United States as free from danger until they
</p>
<p>were united in amity with. Spain;  of c(jurse, by acceding
</p>
<p>to these iniquitous demands. It was this disingenuous in-
</p>
<p>terference by France in behalf of Spain which induced
</p>
<p>Congress to instruct Mr. Jay to abandon the right to navi-
</p>
<p>gate the Mississippi, as has been stated. Having suc-
</p>
<p>ceeded thus far, on the 26th of May, 1781,* Luzerne in-
</p>
<p>formed Congress that Russia and Germany liad offered
</p>
<p>their mediation for a peace, and requested Congress to
</p>
<p>appoint a committee to confer with him in reference to
</p>
<p>the manner of conducting the negotiation, the extent of
</p>
<p>the powers to be granted to the American plenipotentiary,
</p>
<p>the use to be made of those powers, and as to the confidence
</p>
<p>that ought to be reposed in the ministers of the French
</p>
<p>king. Assuredly France was disposed to push her advan-
</p>
<p>tage to the greatest length, but this insolent demand was
</p>
<p>acceded to. The count disapproved of the late nomina-
</p>
<p>tion of a minister to Russia by Congress ; complained that
</p>
<p>Mr. Adams, who was then in Europe with a commission
</p>
<p>for negotiating a treaty of peace, had assumed the right

</p>
<p>Having become master of the situation by the instruc-
</p>
<p>tions Congress had been prevailed on to give their com-
</p>
<p>missioners, France soon gave ominous hints of the sacri-
</p>
<p>fices which the United States were expected to make.
</p>
<p>Taking no measures to facilitate the efforts of Mr. Jay to
</p>
<p>form a treaty with Spain, and expressing .open disappro-
</p>
<p>bation of the efforts made by others to form alliances with
</p>
<p>other European powers, the design of the French court
</p>
<p>was plainly to render the United States solely dependent
</p>
<p>on her, and then to sacrifice our interests in order to keep
</p>
<p>us in that dependent condition. The recognition of our
</p>
<p>independence by Holland was obtained by Mr. Adams
</p>
<p>against the advice and wishes of the French ambassador
</p>
<p>at the Hague. On the 23d of ISTovember, 1781, Count
</p>
<p>Luzerne addressed a communication to Congress, vaguely
</p>
<p>intimating his apprehensions that he might not be able to
</p>
<p>" obtain for every state all they wished," which was a diplo-
</p>
<p>matic way of announcing the purpose of his court to
</p>
<p>strip the south and west of the navigation of the Mississippi,
</p>
<p>and ISTew Eugland of a participation in the fisheries. On
</p>
<p>the 28t.h of January, 1782, he communicated to Congress
</p>
<p>a letter from Vergennes, indicating that the United States
</p>
<p>were expected to accept terms which the French court
</p>
<p>might regard as " reasonable," and the indisposition of
</p>
<p>France "to continue hostilities mainly on account of
</p>
<p>America " in case terms deemed reasonable by France
</p>
<p>might not prove acceptable to the United States. * On
</p>
<p>the 24th of September, 1782, other letters from Vergennes
</p>
<p>were laid before Congress, in one of which the wily diplo-
</p>
<p>mat gave that body to understand the importance of '' con-
</p>
<p>fining themselves within such bounds of moderation, as to give
</p>
<p>no umbrage to any one of the powers at vmr with Great

<p>22 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>The discovery of their mistake in giving such instructions
</p>
<p>to their commissioners was not made by Congress until
</p>
<p>they were thus compelled to sue to a perfidious foreign
</p>
<p>prince for their rights. The flatteries of Vergennes had
</p>
<p>in the meantime so won over Dr. Franklin, that he was
</p>
<p>ready to make the concessions demanded. And this was
</p>
<p>the situation when Mr. Jay, who had fathomed the de-
</p>
<p>signs of France and Spain, arrived in Paris, in June, 1782.
</p>
<p>The negotiation for peace had not yet assumed any
</p>
<p>definite form. Mr. Jay on leaving Spain had been in-
</p>
<p>formed that Count Aranda would renew the negotiation
</p>
<p>with him in Paris, and to him the American commissioner,
</p>
<p>therefore, addressed a letter expressing his readiness for
</p>
<p>the necessary conferences.
</p>
<p>In the first of these conferences, in the presence of Ver-
</p>
<p>gennes, Count Aranda commenced with the subject of the
</p>
<p>western boundary of the United States, proposing to run
</p>
<p>a line east of the Mississippi, which should be the western
</p>
<p>boundar_y of the United States. While promptly claiming
</p>
<p>that river as the true boundary, Mr. Jay, with becoming
</p>
<p>dignity, refrained from discussing the point with Aranda,
</p>
<p>who had not given him a copy of his power to treat with
</p>
<p>the American commissioners.. The count gave iiim a map
</p>
<p>with the proposed line drawn upon it, which was shown
</p>
<p>to Vergennes, whose confidential secretary insisted that
</p>
<p>Jay's assertion of the right of the United States was not
</p>
<p>well founded. This secretarj^, acting at the instance of
</p>
<p>his master, afterwards addreesed to Mr. Jay a letter in
</p>
<p>which he proposed as a condlia.tory line, as the boundary of
</p>
<p>the United States, which would have deprived them not
</p>
<p>only of all the land north of the Ohio, but also of parts of
</p>
<p>Kentucky and Tennessee, and of nearly the whole of Ala-
</p>
<p>bama and Mississippi, which the secretary insisted be-
</p>
<p>longed to Great Britain and the possession of which must

</p>
<p>be determined by the treaty to be made. This letter,
</p>
<p>which was a contrivance of Vergennes to fix a boundary
</p>
<p>agreeable to Spain, without incurring the responsibility
</p>
<p>and odium of direct interference, Mr. Jay never answered.
</p>
<p>The object of Spain was to exclude the citizens of the
</p>
<p>llic Spanish Consinraey. 23
</p>
<p>United States from the Mississippi, and hence slie desired
</p>
<p>tlie honndary to he fixed hy a line east of that river, and
</p>
<p>this purpose was fully countenanced by France. Jay had
</p>
<p>given to Aranda a copy of his commission ; he declined
</p>
<p>to enter into any discussion with the Spaniard until the
</p>
<p>latter had conqdied with the same ceremonial; if Jay re-
</p>
<p>fused to treat there could be no cession of the Mississippi
</p>
<p>or of the proposed western boundary ; if Aranda tendered
</p>
<p>Jay his commission as ambassador, this would itself have
</p>
<p>been a recognition of the independence of the United
</p>
<p>States, which would have rendered them less dependent
</p>
<p>on France ; Jay's conduct thus interfered with the plans
</p>
<p>of Vergennes. So the convenient confidential secretary
</p>
<p>wrote a note to Jay urging him to commence negotiations
</p>
<p>with Aranda,. because a refusal to do so would be oifensive
</p>
<p>to the Spaniard ; which note was also left unanswered.
</p>
<p>Vergennes' next movement was, in the presence of Ar-
</p>
<p>anda, to say to Jay, that he had been already informed by
</p>
<p>the count of his authority to treat, and surely Jay would
</p>
<p>credit him. I>ut Jay was as immovable as he was brave,
</p>
<p>and refused to treat with an}' power which did not first
</p>
<p>acknowledge the independence of his country; and to
</p>
<p>every representation by Vergennes that this acknowledg-
</p>
<p>ment by Spain might be embraced in the treaty to be
</p>
<p>made, he proudly responded that the independence was
</p>
<p>the effect of their contest with the Crown, and that its
</p>
<p>acknowledgment must precede negotiation with any
</p>
<p>power; and thus, France and Spain continuing to act in
</p>
<p>concert for the double purpose of dividing our country
</p>
<p>and bringing our independence under the condescending
</p>
<p>protection of the French, all attempts at negotiation were
</p>
<p>for the time suspended.
</p>
<p>On the 25th of July, 1782, George III issued an order
</p>
<p>for a commission to Richard Oswald empowering him to

</p>
<p>treat with any " commissioner or commissioners named,
</p>
<p>or to be named by the thirteen colonies or plantations in
</p>
<p>North America," and by him a copy of this order was
</p>
<p>communicated to the American commissioners at Paris,
</p>
<p>and by them it was submitted to A'ergennes ; who advised
</p>
<p>24 The Spanish Conspiracy/.
</p>
<p>tliem to treat with Oswald, who was then in Paris, as soon
</p>
<p>as the commission should arrive. Dr. Franklin thought
</p>
<p>the commission to Oswald would do ; hut all the persua-
</p>
<p>sions and flatteries of the French court were unavailing
</p>
<p>to induce the resolute Jay to descend from the ground of
</p>
<p>independence to treat under the description of colonies.
</p>
<p>And now, Mr. Jay determined, that rather than enter
</p>
<p>upon any negotiation derogatory to the dignity of his
</p>
<p>country or injurious to the interests of his country-
</p>
<p>men, he would assume the responsihility of violat-
</p>
<p>ing the express commands of Congress, (that the Ameri-
</p>
<p>can commissioners should act under the advice of Ver-
</p>
<p>gennes,) and of refusing to act with his colleague. He at
</p>
<p>once conferred with Mr. Oswald, in order to render the
</p>
<p>latter instrumental in effecting an alteration in the terms
</p>
<p>of his commission ; and of such weight were his represen-
</p>
<p>tations to the representative of the British king, that it
</p>
<p>was at Oswald's own request that Mr. Jay prepared and
</p>
<p>gave to him a draught of such a commission as would be
</p>
<p>satisfactory, with which a carrier was at once dispatched
</p>
<p>to London. In the meantime Mr. Jay again declined to
</p>
<p>comply with tlie advice of Vergennes, who was ignorant
</p>
<p>of the result of the conference with Oswald, and who again
</p>
<p>urged the commencement of negotiations under the orig-
</p>
<p>inal commission. The answer to Oswald's dispatch, which
</p>
<p>was not sent until the court at London had received
</p>
<p>another from Mr. Fitzherhert, the British minister at
</p>
<p>Paris,  written immediately after the latter had held a
</p>
<p>private conference with Vergennes,  announced the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of King George to graM to America unconditional
</p>
<p>independence as an article of treaty. Jay elicited from Os-
</p>
<p>wald that this answer was suggested by Fitzherhert and
</p>
<p>that the British cabinet had been apprised of the opinion
</p>
<p>of Vergennes. It was obvious to Jay that France wished

</p>
<p>to postpone the acknowledgment of American independ-
</p>
<p>ence ; because, when that was done, the war wouUl be
</p>
<p>abandoned by Great Britian ; the states, having no longer
</p>
<p>any thing to apprehend from their adversary, would cease
</p>
<p>to look to France for protection and counsel, and would
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 25
</p>
<p>refuse to yield by treaty any of their rights, which France
</p>
<p>might barter away with England for concessions to herself
</p>
<p>and her ally  Spain. Thus relieved by the interference
</p>
<p>of Vergennes of all sentiments of delicacy towards
</p>
<p>France which otherwise he might have felt, Mr. Jay no
</p>
<p>longer scrupled to explain to Mr. Oswald the views and
</p>
<p>policy of the French court ; showed him that it was the
</p>
<p>interest of his government to render the United States as
</p>
<p>independent of France as they already were of Great
</p>
<p>Britain ; and drafted a joint letter from Dr. Franklin and
</p>
<p>himself declaring their unalterable determination not to
</p>
<p>treat with any other footing than that of independence ; 
</p>
<p>a letter which Dr. Franklin refused to sign, and which,
</p>
<p>therefore, was left unsigned by Jay, but the draught of
</p>
<p>which was given to Oswald, who sent it to his court. On
</p>
<p>the 6th of September, Mr. Jay received from Vergennes'
</p>
<p>secretary the letter already mentioned in regard to bound-
</p>
<p>aries ;  from which he discerned that it was the intention
</p>
<p>of France to oppose at the peace the extension of the
</p>
<p>United States and their claim to the navigation of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi ; 'probably to support the British-Spanish claims
</p>
<p>to the country above the 31st degree of latitude, and 'cer-
</p>
<p>tainly to all the country north of the Ohio ; and, in case the
</p>
<p>United States would not agree to divide with Spain in the
</p>
<p>manner proposed, to aid Spain in negotiating with Britain
</p>
<p>for the territory she wanted, and would agree that Britain
</p>
<p>should have the residue. On the 9tli Jay learned, that on
</p>
<p>the morning after writing this letter the secretary had a con-
</p>
<p>ference with Aranda and Vergennes, and had then imme-
</p>
<p>diateh' set out for London. His suspicions that the object
</p>
<p>of this visit was to arrange terms with Britain which would
</p>
<p>deprive the United States of their natural rights to take
</p>
<p>fish in the ISTorth American seas, that it might be divided
</p>
<p>with France to the exclusion of others ; to exclude them

<p>from the navigation of the Mississippi, and to divide the
</p>
<p>western country between Great Britain and Spain ;  these
</p>
<p>suspicions were confirmed by a copy of a letter he received
</p>
<p>addressed by Marbois, the French charge de affairs at
</p>
<p>Philadelphia, to Vergennes. Concealing his action from
</p>
<p>26 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Pr. Franklin, as well as from the French government,
</p>
<p>Mr. Jay immediately sent Mr. Vaughan, an English gentle-
</p>
<p>man who was well disposed to America and who resided in
</p>
<p>Paris, as a secret agent to the British secretary of state,
</p>
<p>instructed to report the determination which had already
</p>
<p>been announced, that American independence must be
</p>
<p>acknowledged preliminary to a treaty ; that the United
</p>
<p>States would never make a peace which would take from
</p>
<p>them their rights in the fisheries; and that the attempt to
</p>
<p>exclude them from the navigation of the Mississippi would
</p>
<p>sow the seeds of certain future war. The mission of Mr.
</p>
<p>"Vaughan was attended with such complete success, that
</p>
<p>on the 27th of September he returned to Paris, accom-
</p>
<p>panied by a courier who delivered to Oswald a commission
</p>
<p>authorizing him to treat with the commissioners of the
</p>
<p>United States of America;  and thus was our independence
</p>
<p>acknowledged. The negotiation, which was then immedi-
</p>
<p>ately entered upon between Mr. Oswald and the two
</p>
<p>American commissioners, resulted, in a few days, in an
</p>
<p>agreement upon certain preliminary articles, to be incor-
</p>
<p>porated in the treaty so soon as England and France
</p>
<p>should be ready to cease hostilities;  their alliance with
</p>
<p>France restraining the United States from making a sepa-
</p>
<p>rate peace. These articles were drawn by Mr. Jay, and,
</p>
<p>in most respects like those of the subsequent definitive
</p>
<p>treaty, secured the Mississippi and the fisheries, while the
</p>
<p>boundaries were even more extensive than those finally
</p>
<p>obtained. The British ministry hesitated to agree because
</p>
<p>of the extent of the boundaries, which included nearly
</p>
<p>the whole of Upper Canada, and because, also, the articles
</p>
<p>contained no provision for the Tories. In a contemporary
</p>
<p>conversation with the secretary of Vergennes, he contested
</p>
<p>our right to those back lands upon which Spain had set
</p>
<p>her eyes, and reiterated his views in regard to the fisheries.

</p>
<p>On the 26th of October, John Adams arrived in Paris,
</p>
<p>and in him Jay " found a very able aiul agreeable coadju-
</p>
<p>tor," who "concurred with him on all the points" which
</p>
<p>bad been raised. Franklin was ultimately brought around
</p>
<p>to their views, and assented to " o^o on with theui without
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspirac)/. 27
</p>
<p>consulting this (the French) court," as instructed by Con-
</p>
<p>gress. On the 30th of November, the provisional articles,
</p>
<p>which amounted only to a contract between Great Britain
</p>
<p>and the United States, as to the terms of the treaty when
</p>
<p>that treaty should be made, were signed by the American
</p>
<p>commissioners and Mr. Oswald; and not until the event
</p>
<p>was it announced to Vergennes. On the 3d of Septem-
</p>
<p>ber of the following year, 1783, Mr. Jay signed the detini-
</p>
<p>tive treaty of peace, which gave to Spain the West and
</p>
<p>East Floridas ; and by which Great Britain formally ac-
</p>
<p>knowledged the independence of the United States, and
</p>
<p>recognized as their southern boundary a line drawn due
</p>
<p>east from a point in the Mississippi, in the latitude of 31
</p>
<p>degrees north, which was to be the dividing line between
</p>
<p>us and Spain. '^ It was thus that the seltish projects of
</p>
<p>France and Spain were discovered and frustrated by the
</p>
<p>sagacity, patriotism, firmness and courage of John Jay
</p>
<p>and John Adams ; and it was to these two, staunchest of
</p>
<p>the lovers of republican liberty, that it was due that our
</p>
<p>independence was not taken under the protection of the
</p>
<p>French monarchy, and that Kentucky did not become a
</p>
<p>French or a Spanish province.
</p>
<p>The health of Mr. Jay prevented an acceptance of the
</p>
<p>invitation of the Spanish court, that he would renew his
</p>
<p>negotiations with that power at Madrid. In tlie summer
</p>
<p>of 1784 he returned to the United States, and in Decem-
</p>
<p>ber of that year accepted the position of secretary of for-
</p>
<p>eign affairs. Spain had steadily refused to recognize him
</p>
<p>as the American minister to her court; but, in the spring
</p>
<p>of 1785, Don Diego Gardoqui arrived in Philadelphia
</p>
<p>bearing a commission from his Catholic nuijesty to Con-
</p>

</p>
<p>able obstacle to a treaty were fully realized. Besides this
</p>
<p>question, the conflicting claims of the United States and
</p>
<p>Spain were not easy to be reconciled. The treaty with
</p>
<p>Great Britain made the navigation of the Mississippi from
</p>
<p>its source to its mouth free alike to American and Span-
</p>
<p>iard, and fixed our southern boundary at a line to be
</p>
<p>drawn east from the Mississippi along the thirty-first de-
</p>
<p>gree of latitude. But the treaty also warranted West
</p>
<p>Florida to Spain, and the northern boundary of that prov-
</p>
<p>ince had been extended to a line drawn due east from the
</p>
<p>mouth of the Yazoo river, in latitude 32 28'; and all the
</p>
<p>intervening territory the Spaniards had in actual military
</p>
<p>possession, and claimed to hold it also under the warranty
</p>
<p>of Great Britain ; and, as the owner of both banks of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi, insisted upon her exclusive right to its navi-
</p>
<p>gation within her own territory. The United States, on
</p>
<p>the other hand, claimed the right not only to navigate the
</p>
<p>river as far as their own territory on its east bank ex-
</p>
<p>tended, as fixed at the thirty-first degree, but to its mouth
</p>
<p>as well ;  on the ground that by the treaty with France
</p>
<p>of 1763, under which Spain claimed her right to the river
</p>
<p>and its navigation. Great Britain had from the same power
</p>
<p>derived a concurrent right of navigation from its source
</p>
<p>to the Gulf, and that the United States had succeeded to
</p>
<p>all the rights which had belonged to Great Britain under
</p>
<p>that treaty.
</p>
<p>As Gardoqui declared that liis king would never permit
</p>
<p>any nation to use the river, the United States was reduced
</p>
<p>to the alternative of permitting their claims to lie dormant
</p>
<p>for the present, or of supporting them by arms, v/hich they
</p>
<p>were in no condition to do. Congress had instructed Mr.
</p>
<p>Ja}^, as secretary of foreign affairs, "that he enter into no
</p>
<p>treaty, compact, or convention whatever, with the said
</p>
<p>representative of Spain, which does not stipulate the right

<p>of the United States to the navigation of the Mississippi
</p>
<p>and the boundaries as established by the treaty with Great
</p>
<p>Britain." All negotiation was, therefore, suspended by
</p>
<p>these conflicting claims, and more than a year had passed
</p>
<p>without the slightest progress being made. On the 3d of
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 29
</p>
<p>September, 1786, in answer to the summons of Congress,
</p>
<p>Mr. Jay went before that body and announced his unal-
</p>
<p>terable adherence to the justice and importance of the
</p>
<p>claims of the United States, of which, as has been already
</p>
<p>seen, he had been the foremost and most influential advo-
</p>
<p>cate. He had, however, no anticipation of the rapidity
</p>
<p>of the future growth of the Vf est. He proceeded to state
</p>
<p>that a " proper commercial treaty with Spain would be of
</p>
<p>more importance to the United States than any they have
</p>
<p>formed, or can forhi, with any other nation." He drew
</p>
<p>attention to the family compact between France and
</p>
<p>Spain, which, "in case of a rupture between us and
</p>
<p>Spain," would almost certainly add France to our foes.
</p>
<p>The obstacles to the desired treaty were the questions of
</p>
<p>boundary and the navigation of the Mississippi, and he
</p>
<p>had found Gardoqui immovable on the latter topic. Un-
</p>
<p>less it could be in some manner settled, no treaty could be
</p>
<p>concluded. Spain already excluded us from the naviga-*
</p>
<p>tion, and held it with a strong hand against us, and it
</p>
<p>could only be acquired by wai\ We were not prepared
</p>
<p>for a war with Spain or any other power, and a large por-
</p>
<p>tion of the confederation would undoubtedly refuse to go
</p>
<p>to war with Spain for the object in question. Though the
</p>
<p>navigation would ultimately be of immense importance,
</p>
<p>he did not think it would be for twenty-five or thirty
</p>
<p>years, and it would be that long before we would be in a
</p>
<p>condition to enforce our rights. He, therefore, deemed it
</p>
<p>expedient to enter into a treaty with Spain limited to that
</p>
<p>time, and during which we " would forbear to use the
</p>
<p>navigation of that river below our own territories to the
</p>
<p>ocean;"  not cede or barter away our rights. He did not
</p>
<p>know that this would be acceptable to Spain, but he
</p>
<p>thought the experiment worth trying. But if this could
</p>
<p>not be effected, the " Mississippi would continue shut

<p>France would tell us our claim to it was ill-founded. The
</p>
<p>Spanish posts on its banks, and even those out of Florida
</p>
<p>in our country would be strengthened, and that nation

<p>would then bid us defiance, with impunity, at least until

<p>nation than it at present is. For, unblessed with an effi-
</p>
<p>cient government, destitut<i of funds, and without public
</p>
<p>credit, either at home or abroad, we should be obliged to
</p>
<p>wait in patience for better days, or plunge into an unpop-
</p>
<p>ular or dangerous war with very little prospect of termi-
</p>
<p>nating it by a peace either advantageous or glorious.
</p>
<p>Supposing the Spanish business out of the question, yet
</p>
<p>the situation of the United States appears to me to be
</p>
<p>seriously delicate, and to call for great circumspection
</p>
<p>both at home and abroad ; nor, in my opinion, will this
</p>
<p>cease to be the case until a vigorous national government
</p>
<p>be formed, and public credit and confidence be estab-
</p>
<p>lished." *
</p>
<p>The delegates in Congress from the seven Northern
</p>
<p>States, voting by states and constituting a majority oi one,
</p>
<p>decided to rescind Mr, Jay's instructions and to leave
</p>
<p>him free, if found necessary in order to conclude a
</p>
<p>'treaty, to agree to forbear the use of the Mississippi be-
</p>
<p>low our own boundary, for twenty years ; the six South-
</p>
<p>ern States, voted against rescinding; and the General As-
</p>
<p>sembly of Virginia, by resolutions passed by the House in
</p>
<p>ISTovember and by the Senate on the 7th of December,
</p>
<p>1786, instructed her delegates never to accede to such a
</p>
<p>proposition, in which she wasj^ heartily supported by the
</p>
<p>other non-concurring states. It required the vote of nine
</p>
<p>states to give validity to any treaty which might be agreed
</p>
<p>upon by the representatives of tlie two governments, and
</p>
<p>the action of the six Southern States, in case they con-
</p>
<p>tinued to adhere to their position, made it certain that. a
</p>
<p>treaty containing such a provision would be rejected by
</p>
<p>Congress. But Mr. Jay, regarding the action of the seven
</p>
<p>states as abrogating the restriction upon him, in the spring
</p>
<p>of 1787 renewed with Gardoqui the negotiation (which
</p>
<p>had slumbered from the previous fall until then,) by pro-

<p>to a navigation wliich we were to have forborne for a
</p>
<p>definite, period. But the Spanish minister refusing as-
</p>
<p>sent to an article which thus conceded by necessary impli-
</p>
<p>cation our right to navigate that stream, rejected with equal
</p>
<p>hauteur a subsequent proposition of Mr. Jay which left
</p>
<p>the whole question of right in abeyance, and would con-
</p>
<p>sent to no treaty which did not in express terms formally
</p>
<p>abandon all claim of right by the United States to nav-
</p>
<p>igate that river below their own territory. The non-con-
</p>
<p>curring delegates to Congress vigorously assailed the as-
</p>
<p>sumption that seven states could authorize the minister to
</p>
<p>propose an article to a treaty which had been formally
</p>
<p>condemned by six states, when it required the assent
</p>
<p>of nine states to give validity to the treaty itself; and
</p>
<p>when Mr. Madison left Congress on the 2Gth of April,
</p>
<p>1787, to attend the convention to frame a new govern-
</p>
<p>ment, the project was considered to be at an end.*
</p>
<p>Washington, who had for years zealously advocated /
</p>
<p>the construction of a canal between the headwaters of the
</p>
<p>James and the Kanawha rivers, as a means of connectingthe
</p>
<p>west with the east, had, in June, 1786, written to Col. Henry i
</p>
<p>Lee, then a delegate in Congress, his opinion that it would
</p>
<p>be better " neither to relinquish nor to push our claim to
</p>
<p>this navigation," but in the meantime '' to open all the com-
</p>
<p>munications which nature has afforded between the At-
</p>
<p>lantic States and the western territory;" that "whenever
</p>
<p>the new states become so populous and so extended to the
</p>
<p>westward, as to really need it, there will be no power
</p>
<p>which can deprive them of the use of the Mississippi,"
</p>
<p>and that in the meantime it would be best not to urge the
</p>
<p>subject; and closed with this remark, which exhibits at
</p>
<p>once his sagacity and his apprehensions : " It may re-

<p>the General Assembly of his state, shows that his individual
</p>
<p>opinions were in advance of those of Washington and
</p>
<p>agreed with Jay, that exclusion from the Mississippi was
</p>
<p>at the time unimportant to the west, while the commer-
</p>
<p>cial advantages offered by Spain were of great value to
</p>
<p>the east, and that he was inclined to the course suggested by
</p>
<p>Mr. Jay a few weeks later,* The response of Washington,
</p>
<p>July 26th, 1786, states his previous ignorance of the diffi-
</p>
<p>culties in the way of a negotiation with Spain, and reasserts
</p>
<p>his opinion that address would be necessary in tempor-
</p>
<p>izing with Kentucky, the population of which was rapidly
</p>
<p>increasing. " There are many ambitious and turbulent
</p>
<p>spirits," he said, " among its inhabitants, who, from the
</p>
<p>present difficulties in their intercourse with the Atlantic
</p>
<p>States, have turned their eyes to ]N"ew Orleans, and may

<p>with it is cut off by treaty.f"

<p>In another letter to Col. Lee, dated October 31st, 1786,

<p>Gen. Washington wrote : " With respect to the naviga-

<p>tion of the Mississippi, 3'ou already know my sentiments.
</p>
<p>They have been uniformly the same, and, as I have ob-

<p>one consideration of weight, and that is, the operation the

<p>tlers, who will not consider the subject in a relative point
</p>
<p>of view, or on a comprehensive scale, and may be in-

<p>fluenced by the demagogues of the country to acts of ex-
</p>
<p>travagance and desperation, under the popular declamation

<p>that their interests are sacrificed."

<p>The Settlement op the West  Kentucky  Indian Hostilities 
</p>
<p>Geo. E.. Clark.
</p>
<p>Before the commencement of the French and Indian
</p>
<p>War, companies had been formed and had obtained grants
</p>
<p>of land with a view to the settlement of the country on
</p>
<p>the Monongahela and Upper Ohio. The prospecting tour
</p>
<p>of Dr. Thomas Walker, Captain Charles Campbell, the
</p>
<p>gallant Colonel James Patton, and their sssociates into
</p>
<p>Kentucky, as early as 1750, was not a mere idle voyage of
</p>
<p>adventure, but was made with a definite purpose of future
</p>
<p>colonization.* These various projects were interrupted
</p>
<p>by the breaking out of hostilities, but the struggle for su-
</p>
<p>premacy between France and Britain had scarcely been
</p>
<p>terminated by the treaty of 1763, when the thoughts of
</p>
<p>the enterprising were once more seriously turned towards
</p>
<p>the West. , The preparations for the contemplated move-
</p>
<p>ment were for only a brief time delayed by the wide
</p>
<p>spread conspiracy of Pontiac, which made the border
</p>
<p>streams of Pennsylvania and Virginia run with the
</p>
<p>blood of the frontier settlers. The confederation organ-
</p>
<p>ized by the sagacious and warlike chief speedily dissolved
</p>
<p>upon his failure to capture the strongholds at Detroit,
</p>
<p>Niagara and Fort Pitt; and the apprehensions and jealous-
</p>
<p>ies of the red men were in a measure and for a time
</p>
<p>allayed by the proclamation of 1763, to which reference
</p>
<p>has been made. The pacificatory effect of the assurances
</p>
<p>given in this proclamation was increased by the expedition
</p>
<p>of General Bradstreet upon the Erie, and of the gallant
</p>
<p>* The journal of Dr. Thomas Walker mentions the loss of his toma-
</p>
<p>hawk during a tremendous rain-storm. It was found long afterwards
</p>
<p>by one of the McAfee's on the banks of Dick's river ; this circumstance
</p>
<p>proves that he had penetrated as far as that stream.

<p>Swiss, Colonel Henry Bouquet, who penetrated to the
</p>
<p>Forks of the Muskingum, and on the 9th of ISTovember,
</p>
<p>1764, concluded a peace with the Shawanese and Dela-
</p>
<p>wares, securing- from them two hundred and six of their
</p>
<p>unfortunate captives, who were restored to their friends
</p>
<p>and homes. Bradstreet had already, about the 21st of
</p>
<p>August, concluded a treaty at Detroit with the head men
</p>
<p>of more than twenty tribes. The successes of Bradstreet
</p>
<p>and Bouquet paved the way for the yet more general
</p>
<p>treaty of peace made with the various tribes by Sir
</p>
<p>William Johnson, in April, 1765, at the German Flats;
</p>
<p>where the Indians proposed as a boundary beyond which
</p>
<p>the whites should not go the Ohio or Alleghany and
</p>
<p>Susquehanna, to which Johnson had no authority to
</p>
<p>accede ; and where the red men agreed to give the
</p>
<p>traders whom they had despoiled in the uprising of 1763,
</p>
<p>a large tract of land in compensation.
</p>
<p>In spite of the royal proclamation of 1763, the aggres-
</p>
<p>sive pioneers pushed their settlements not only to the
</p>
<p>Watauga, in the Cherokee country, but upon the Red-
</p>
<p>stone, the Monongahela, and the Cheat rivers, in regions
</p>
<p>claimed by the I^orthern Indians, and for which they had
</p>
<p>not yet received compensation ;  so that a general border
</p>
<p>war was once more feared. In the meantime, the Ohio
</p>
<p>Company, the soldiers claiming under Dinwiddle's pro-
</p>
<p>clamation, and individuals claiming under grants made by
</p>
<p>Virginia, were all clamoring for a perfection of their
</p>
<p>grants or a completion of their claims, while the Indians
</p>
<p>were raging at the constant encroachments upon them.
</p>
<p>The orders of General Gage, the Commander-in-Chief of
</p>
<p>his Majesty's forces, and of Sir William Johnson, the
</p>
<p>Indian Agent, for their removal were defied by the set-
</p>
<p>tlers, who remained upon and stoutly held their clearings.
</p>
<p>Every circumstance demanded that the boundary line sug-

<p>gested by the Indians at the conference in 1765, at the
</p>
<p>German Flats, should be fixed, and that their title to the
</p>
<p>lands ceded by that boundary should be extinguished. In
</p>
<p>the spring of 1768, Sir William Johnson received orders
</p>
<p>relative to a new treaty with the Indians for that purpose,
</p>
<p>The Spanish Con^nracy. 35
</p>
<p>and at once took measures to secure a full attendance of
</p>
<p>their representatives. The Congress, which was attended
</p>
<p>by deputies from all the Six Nations and the Shawanese
</p>
<p>and Delawares, met at Fort Stanwix, in October, 1768, and
</p>
<p>sat for nearly seven weeks. The boundary agreed upon
</p>
<p>began on the Ohio at the mouth of what is now called the
</p>
<p>Tennessee river; thence it ran up the Ohio and Alleghany
</p>
<p>to Kittauing, and thence across to the Susquehanna ; 
</p>
<p>thus transferring to the British all of the country south of
</p>
<p>the Alleghany and Ohio to which the Six Nations had any
</p>
<p>claim. The tract between the Monongahela and the
</p>
<p>Kanawha was conveyed to the traders who had been de-
</p>
<p>spoiled in 1763, who named it Indiana. The remainder,
</p>
<p>from the Kanawha down, was deeded to King George, for
</p>
<p>which the consideration in money and goods, aggre-
</p>
<p>gating more than 10,000, was paid down. It was agreed
</p>
<p>that no claim should ever be based upon the previous
</p>
<p>treaties at Lancaster and Logstown.
</p>
<p>Upon this treaty, which was not extorted from the In-
</p>
<p>dians under a pressure of disaster to them, nor by hard
</p>
<p>persuasion backed by force, but was made voluntarily and
</p>
<p>at once, rested the title of the crown to -Western Penn-
</p>
<p>sylvania, Western Virginia and Kentucky. The lands
</p>
<p>ceded were not occupied by any of the Six Nations, nor
</p>
<p>were they hunted over by the tribes of that confederacy,
</p>
<p>whose habitations and hunting lands were far distant.
</p>
<p>The cession was made by chiefs of tribes who were in no
</p>
<p>way directly or practically interested in the lands ceded,
</p>
<p>under the manipulations of Sir William Johnson, who had
</p>
<p>in contemplation the founding of a new and independent
</p>
<p>colony in the territory designated ; while the Ohio and
</p>
<p>Western Indians, who were immediately and greatly inter-
</p>
<p>ested, had no voice in the treaty. It is true the treaty

<p>their chiefs, and that neither those nor any of the other

<p>tribes of the West recognized the validity of the grant

<p>tious over this territory by reasou of their alleged con-
</p>
<p>quests of the Shawanese, Delawares, Miamis, and other
</p>
<p>tribes, nearly a century before ; the former exerted no
</p>
<p>practical dominion over the latter, who did not by any
</p>
<p>means assent to the " dependency " on their own part to the
</p>
<p>Six N'ations, which was asserted in the treaty by which
</p>
<p>they steadily refused to be bound. After all, the title was
</p>
<p>essentially and practically worthless, and the results to the
</p>
<p>settlers who planted themselves upon the lands, and to
</p>
<p>the tril^es from whom tljey were wrested, would not have
</p>
<p>been different had the treaty never been made. But the
</p>
<p>Cherokees also claimed Kentucky, and the histories con-
</p>
<p>tain vague allusions to a purchase made of their rights in
</p>
<p>a portion of the territory embraced in what is now ciClled
</p>
<p>by that name, by Colonel John Donaldson and by Dr.
</p>
<p>Thomas Walker at later dates. However, these treaties
</p>
<p>served the purpose of quieting the conscience of the
</p>
<p>white man, who could cite them as his authority for locat-
</p>
<p>ing amid the rich canebrakes and sightly groves of beau-
</p>
<p>tiful Kentucky, where the Indians did not live, but for
</p>
<p>the possession of which as their hunting lands the warlike
</p>
<p>tribes from the South and North had battled from remote
</p>
<p>ages.

<p>the treaty of Fort Stanwix. But the circumstance of
</p>
<p>most potent influence upon the future settlement of the
</p>
<p>country on the Ohio was the liberal bounty in western
</p>
<p>lands given to the officers and soldiers of the Virginia
</p>
<p>troops who had served in the British army in the war of
</p>
<p>1763. All Kentucky was then included in the vague
</p>
<p>boundaries of Fincastle county, Virginia, of which Will-
</p>
<p>iam Preston was at the time the surveyor. It was as the
</p>
<p>deputies of Preston, therefore, that John Floyd, Hancock
</p>
<p>Taylor, James Douglas, Hancock Lee, and others made
</p>
<p>their surveys for man}' of these officers and soldiers in
</p>
<p>1774, all along the south bank of the Ohio, up the Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky, and among the cane lands which skirted the Elk-
</p>
<p>horn.
</p>
<p>"While the relations between the white and the red men
</p>
<p>during the ten years succeeding 1763 were nominally
</p>
<p>peaceful, and were really so between the Indians and the
</p>
<p>Pennsylvanians, who were traders ; in fact there were fre-
</p>
<p>quent individual collisions between the Indians and the
</p>
<p>Virginians, who were settlers, and whose evident purpose
</p>
<p>it was to permanently possess and occupy the lands south
</p>
<p>of the Ohio. That the jealousy and animosity of the In-
</p>
<p>dians were thoroughly aroused by the advent of these
</p>
<p>numerous parties of hunters, explorers and surveyors,
</p>
<p>upon the hunting grounds of Kentucky, over which they
</p>
<p>had roamed for unknown centuries, was but natural.
</p>
<p>From 1769, when Stewart fell the first victim in Kentucky
</p>
<p>in the war between the races, it continued to be waged
</p>
<p>with equal and inextinguishable ferocity and cruelty on
</p>
<p>both sides, until this fair portion of creation had been
</p>
<p>finally wrested from the savage, and teemed with a manly,
</p>
<p>brave, and generous people. Here the white and the red
</p>
<p>man seldom or never met without instant aggression from
</p>
<p>the one side or the other.

<p>It is foreign to the purpose of these pages to more
</p>
<p>than mention the dispute between Virginia and Pennsyl-
</p>
<p>vania concerning the boundary between those colonies, as
</p>
<p>indirectly connected with the events which, in 1774, con-
</p>
<p>verted the aggressive belligerency of individuals into open
</p>
<p>38 The S'panish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>and general hostility between the races. The chief fomen-
</p>
<p>ter of the disturbances which grew out of that dispute
</p>
<p>was Dr. John Conolly; by whom also was issued the cir-
</p>
<p>cular to all the settlers on the Ohio below Fort Pitt, which
</p>
<p>led to the murder by Michael Cresap and his party of the
</p>
<p>friendly Indians whom William Butler had sent as mes-
</p>
<p>sengers to his agents and employes to return to Fort Pitt
</p>
<p>with the peltries on hand ; to the murder by Cresap of the
</p>
<p>peaceable Indians at Captina ; and to the murder by Great-
</p>
<p>house of the family of the Mingo Chief, Logan, at Yel-
</p>
<p>low creek, with every attending circumstance of mingled
</p>
<p>treachery, cruelty and cowardice. These were the out-
</p>
<p>rages which immediately led to the gathering of his
</p>
<p>dusky warriors by Logan, and their descent with aveng-
</p>
<p>ing hate upon the settlers on the Monongahela, and to
</p>
<p>the various kindred acts of retaliation and revenge, on
</p>
<p>both sides, which speedily culminated in Dunmore's war
</p>
<p>of 1774. The surveying operations in Kentucky were
</p>
<p>suspended, the country was at once abandoned by the va-
</p>
<p>rious parties of hunters, explorers and surveyors, to whom
</p>
<p>Boone and Stoner conveyed the warning messages of Dun-
</p>
<p>more, and who returned to Virginia, many of them to
</p>
<p>participate in the victory at Point Pleasant or to march
</p>
<p>with Dunmore into the Indian country in Ohio. They did
</p>
<p>not return to Kentucky until the ensuing year of 1775,
</p>
<p>when the first permanent settlements were made by Boone,
</p>
<p>Harrod, the McAfees, Logan and others. In the mean-
</p>
<p>time, in spite of the well understood proclamation of King
</p>
<p>George prohibiting all purchases of lands from the Indians
</p>
<p>by private persons, and notwithstanding the treaty of
</p>
<p>Fort Stanwix (of which they probably were not ignorant),
</p>
<p>Richard Henderson and his associates of Korth Carolina,
</p>
<p>concluded in March, 1775, at the Sycamore Shoals, on the
</p>
<p>Watauga river, a treaty with the Cherokees ; by which

<p>title. Before the arrival of the alleged new proprietors,
</p>
<p>Boone and his hardy woodsmen, acting as pioneers for
</p>
<p>this Transylvania Company, had erected the first cabins at
</p>
<p>Boonevsboro. The associates immediately proceeded to or-
</p>
<p>ganize what they designed as a proprietary government,
</p>
<p>independent of Virginia, (by which colony the right of
</p>
<p>dominion was claimed), and having its own separate exec-
</p>
<p>utive, legislative and judicial officers ; and not only did
</p>
<p>they assume the authority to sell lands and convey titles,
</p>
<p>but also to put in operation all the machinery and to ex-
</p>
<p>ert all the powers of government. Conflicts of titles and
</p>
<p>of jurisdiction at once sprung up, Virginia interfered and
</p>
<p>asserted her paramount authority, and, the proprietors ac-
</p>
<p>quiescing in the decision, the existence of the new repub-
</p>
<p>lic was transitory, leaving no ripple behind to show that it
</p>
<p>had been even contemplated. Thus, in the very inception
</p>
<p>of the settlement of Kentucky, when but a few hunters,
</p>
<p>woodsmen, adventurers and surveyor^ inhabited its entire
</p>
<p>expanse of hill and valley, of woodland, canebrake and
</p>
<p>prairie, and when but a few monarchs of the primeval
</p>
<p>forest with which to construct the scattering huts and
</p>
<p>weak stockades had been felled, was witnessed the first
</p>
<p>effort for independence. But in the movement there is not
</p>
<p>discernible a trace of disloyalty to the cause of republican
</p>
<p>liberty, to which Virginia and her sister colonies were soon
</p>
<p>to become irrevocably committed.
</p>
<p>Most notable of the daring spirits who had sought the
</p>
<p>west in 1774. was one of the gallant sons of a plain farmer
</p>
<p>of Albemarle county, Virginia, whose narrow and strait-
</p>
<p>ened circumstances did not permit him to afford his boys
</p>
<p>the educational advantages then within the reach of the
</p>
<p>offspring of wealthier Virginian planters. He was not in
</p>
<p>any sense well educated, even as that word was under-
</p>
<p>stood at the time in Virginia, where education was less

<p>general than it was in New England, but the more fortu-
</p>
<p>nate class of whose youth was not inferior to the same
</p>
<p>class in the more northern colonies in broad and liberal
</p>
<p>culture. A scanty knowledge of orthography and syntax,

<p>and a little acquaintance with backwoods surveying was

</p>
<p>about all the learning to be gleaned from the text books
</p>
<p>which the young Virginian possessed. But strong native
</p>
<p>powers, quick perception, and an intuitive knowledge of
</p>
<p>men, more than compensated for his deficiency in the learn-
</p>
<p>ing of the schools. His mental faculties were as ready and
</p>
<p>active as they were clear and vigorous. In enterprise he
</p>
<p>was as alert and audacious as he was cool, decided and in-
</p>
<p>trepid in action. His open and handsome countenance in-
</p>
<p>vited the confidence of all; his eminently manly and martial
</p>
<p>bearing at once secured respect. A life passed in the
</p>
<p>open air, sometimes in labor, but more 'generally in sur-
</p>
<p>veying or in hunting, had strengthened a hardy constitu-
</p>
<p>tion, had accustomed him to feats of endurance and en-
</p>
<p>dued him with uncomplaining fortitude. Instinctively
</p>
<p>men recognized in him a leader in all the vicissitudes of
</p>
<p>life on the border and in a debatable land. But to many
</p>
<p>of the highest and more valuable qualities was added the
</p>
<p>curse of passions he did not curb, and of appetites he
</p>
<p>could not control, which became his master, and which
</p>
<p>early sapped his strength, clouded his mind, undermined his
</p>
<p>character, and wrought his downfall. "While the story of
</p>
<p>the achievements of George Rogers Clark as related by
</p>
<p>the historians is the most brilliant of all that illumine the
</p>
<p>annals of the west, that of his life, if truthfully written,
</p>
<p>would be found one of the saddest and most pitiful.
</p>
<p>In 1772, Clark had come as far west as the Kanawha.
</p>
<p>Two years later he was on his way to Kentucky, and had
</p>
<p>reached a point some distance below Wheeling, in April,
</p>
<p>1774, when he and the band of hunters with whom he
</p>
<p>was journeying determined to inaugurate a war against
</p>
<p>the Indians, under the leadership of Michael Cresap. It
</p>
<p>is ascertained from Clark's letter written in defense of
</p>
<p>Cresap, that the former was with the latter when the
</p>
<p>Indian messengers of William Butler were killed, and

<p>when the peaceful encampment at Captina was assailed ;

<p>and it is mainly to his testimony that Cresap is indebted
</p>
<p>for his vindication from the charge brought by Jefferson,
</p>
<p>that he was the butcher of the family of Logan. Re-

<p>huuters with him enlisted under Dunmore in the war
</p>
<p>which quickly followed, and the speedy recognition of
</p>
<p>Clark's singular capacity for command and personal in-
</p>
<p>trepidity obtained for him a captain's commission. He
</p>
<p>was with Dunmore in his march into Ohio. During that
</p>
<p>fall and winter Clark, and many of the other soldiers under
</p>
<p>Dunmore and Andrew Lewis, made arrangements to pro-
</p>
<p>ceed in their purpose to establish themselves in Kentucky,
</p>
<p>which had been interrupted b}' the brief . but bloody
</p>
<p>struggle with the Indians; and the early spring of 1775
</p>
<p>found him at Harrodsburg, where he at once assumed the
</p>
<p>leadership of as hardy and as brave a band of adventurers
</p>
<p>as any the world ever saw. In the fall he returned to Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia, but the next spring made his way a second time to
</p>
<p>Kentucky, with whose settlement, defense and progress
</p>
<p>his name during the next ten years is inseparably and most
</p>
<p>honorably associated. He found the public mind, as well
</p>
<p>as public affairs in the new settlements all in confusion.
</p>
<p>The claims of proprietorship asserted by the Transylvania
</p>
<p>Company were repudiated by many of the settlers, who
</p>
<p>preferred a formal request to Virginia to assert her para-
</p>
<p>mount authority. l!^orth Carolina also denounced and re-
</p>
<p>jected the private treaty made between Henderson and the
</p>
<p>Cherokees, and it was a disputed question whether the
</p>
<p>alleged purchase was within the jurisdiction of Virginia
</p>
<p>or in that of Forth Carolina. This knot the prompt mind
</p>
<p>of Clark decided to cut without waiting for it to be untied.
</p>
<p>At his suggestion a public meeting was held at Harrods-
</p>
<p>burg in June, 1776, which elected himself and John Gab-
</p>
<p>riel Jones as members of the Virginia Assembly, provision
</p>
<p>for which was made by the convention of 1776. It is said,
</p>
<p>in the sketch published in Collins and written by a friendly
</p>
<p>and most partial hand,* that this action was a disappoint-
</p>
<p>ment to Clark, who wished to be appointed as an agent to

<p>formulated any plan, except that if Virginia failed at once
</p>
<p>to assert her jurisdiction, lie intended to use the lands of
</p>
<p>Kentucky as a fund to invite settlers and with them to es-
</p>
<p>tablish an independent state [Collins]. Yet, accepting the
</p>
<p>inferior commission confided to their hands, he and his
</p>
<p>associate set out at once for Virginia. They found the
</p>
<p>convention adjourned, and the assembly not yet met.
</p>
<p>Their application to the council for ammunition with
</p>
<p>which to defend the west being met with a proposition
</p>
<p>to le7id instead of give the needed supplies, it is stated by
</p>
<p>his eulogist in Collins, that Clark rejoined "that a country
</p>
<p>which is not worth defending is not worth claiming;"
</p>
<p>plainly intimating his intention to carry out his original de-
</p>
<p>sign, to disregard the jurisdiction which the squeamish coun-
</p>
<p>cil hesitated to maintain for Virginia, and at once to assert
</p>
<p>and to endeavor to establish for the settlers who were hud-
</p>
<p>dled together at Boonesboro, St. Asaphs and Harrod's an ab-
</p>
<p>solute independence and sovereignty. The thread which
</p>
<p>bound spirits lil<:e his in the west to their countrymen in the
</p>
<p>east was indeed slender. Whether he could have carried
</p>
<p>with him the earnest men who had sent him as their repre-
</p>
<p>sentative, and not as their ambassador, to Virginia; and
</p>
<p>what might have been the effect of the action which he
</p>
<p>contemplated in a contingency which did not arise, are
</p>
<p>themes for conjecture. The powder which Clark de-
</p>
<p>manded was furnished by the council, was conveyed by
</p>
<p>Clark and Jones and seven others from Pittsburg to Cabin
</p>
<p>creek, and thence was taken to the stockades of the in-
</p>
<p>terior. The lirst assembly of the new State of Virginia
</p>
<p>met in October, 1776. The record of the proceedings of
</p>
<p>its house of delegates on the second day of the session
</p>
<p>shows, that on that day was presented the petition of the
</p>
<p>"inhabitants on the western parts of Fincastle county,"
</p>
<p>stating their grievances against the Transylvania Company,

<p>recognizing the jurisdiction and authority of Virginia, an-
</p>
<p>nouncing their action in the election of two persons as
</p>
<p>members of the assembly, and requesting their admission
</p>
<p>as such, and avowing their readiness " to assist in the
</p>
<p>present laudable cause, by contributing their quota of men

</p>
<p>and money." Two days later the committee reported to
</p>
<p>the house that the said persons could not be admitted as
</p>
<p>members because the " western part of Fincastle " was
</p>
<p>not allowed by law a distinct representation, but that "the
</p>
<p>said inhabitants ought to be formed into a distinct county,
</p>
<p>in order to entitle them to such representation ; " and,
</p>
<p>after disagreements between the house and senate had
</p>
<p>been reconciled, a bill was finally passed abolishing Fin-
</p>
<p>castle and dividing its territory into three distinct coun-
</p>
<p>ties, one of which was Kentucky. The qualification for
</p>
<p>electors and representatives in the said county were " the
</p>
<p>possession of twenty-five acres of land with a house or
</p>
<p>plantation thereon, or one hundred acres without a house
</p>
<p>and plantation, and having right to an estate for life at
</p>
<p>least in the said land in his own right, or in right of his
</p>
<p>wife."
</p>
<p>Having returned to Harrodsburg late in December,
</p>
<p>1776, during the next two years Clark was constantly
</p>
<p>alert, active and energetic. Now in the interior of Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky defending the settlers and their stations; again
</p>
<p>along the Ohio, watching the Indians and guarding against
</p>
<p>invasion ; then passing to and from Virginia, planning
</p>
<p>offensive measures and perfecting the organization neces-
</p>
<p>sary to their execution ;  his vigilance was as ceaseless as
</p>
<p>his resolution was dauntless. The winter of 1778-9 wit-
</p>
<p>nessed his daring capture of Vincennes and Kaskaskia,
</p>
<p>which transferred our boundary to the northern lakes and
</p>
<p>added to the repubhc five states, rich in all the resources of
</p>
<p>boundless material development, and teeming with a popu-
</p>
<p>lation of restless energies. Had the achievement been less
</p>
<p>far-reaching and splendid in its ultimate results, it would
</p>
<p>still excite the admiration of all, by the endurance, hardi-
</p>
<p>hood, and courage of the men engaged, and by the audacity
</p>
<p>and skill of the hero by whom it was planned and executed.

<p>Henceforth the services of Clark were of a national char-
</p>
<p>acter. The fort established by him at the Falls was of no
</p>
<p>avail to protect the settlers of the interior from forays by
</p>
<p>small bands of savages which crossed the Ohio at many
</p>
<p>points above and below. Still less could it prevent those
</p>
<p>44 The Sjjanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>larger expeditions of warriors and trained savages under
</p>
<p>the leadership of white mpn, which were organized and
</p>
<p>equipped at Detroit, and which in secret wound their ways
</p>
<p>up the valleys of the Kentucky and the Licking until they
</p>
<p>reached points from which to vent their hate upon de-
</p>
<p>tached settlers, or to strike at the stations destined for
</p>
<p>assault or siege. Their defense devolved upon other gal-
</p>
<p>lant men, who in turn carried havoc, reprisal, aud ven-
</p>
<p>geance to the Indian towns of Ohio and Indiana. But it
</p>
<p>is foreign to our purpose to name them or to dwell upon,
</p>
<p>their feats of daring, upon the instances of generous self-
</p>
<p>sacrifice which proved them noble, upon the sufferings
</p>
<p>and horrors to which they were subjected, or upon the dan-
</p>
<p>gers they braved with unquailing hearts aud unflinching
</p>
<p>nerve. The last invasion of Kentucky by any large body
</p>
<p>of Indians ended at the disastrous battle of the Blue
</p>
<p>Licks. The preliminary treaty of peace with Great Brit-
</p>
<p>ain was made known in Kentucky in the spring of 1783,
</p>
<p>and in July of that year, George R. Clark was formally
</p>
<p>notified by the governor of Virginia, in terms of praise
</p>
<p>and gratitude, that the state was no longer able to employ
</p>
<p>him as a general ofl&cer in her service.*
</p>
<p>* On the 103d page of his " Pohtical Beginnings," referring to the pas-
</p>
<p>sage of the Ordinance of 1787, Colonel John Mason Brown says : " That
</p>
<p>wide domain, from the Scioto to the Father of Waters, over which the
</p>
<p>unaided valor of Virginia's sons in Kentucky had established dominion,
</p>
<p>was readily absorbed into the new nation that was forming." The
</p>
<p>writer has been unable to find in the " Beginnings " any reference to
</p>
<p>the fact, that a large part of the men who marched with Clark against
</p>
<p>Kaskaskia and Vincennes were recruited in Virginia for that purpose.
</p>
<p>This omission, coupled with the statement just quoted, would convey the
</p>
<p>impression that the Illinois was captured by Clark and such soldiers as
</p>
<p>he was able to obtain in Kentucky alone, unaided from Virginia or any
</p>
<p>other source. This would seem to render proper the correction : That

<p>not only were a large part of the arms and all the ammunition obtained
</p>
<p>from Pittsburg, and paid for by Virginia ; not only were the men paid,
</p>
<p>the supplies bought, and all the expenses borne, by Virginia;  but, in
</p>
<p>addition, a considerable portion of the men engaged were recruited in
</p>
<p>Virginia, and were transported by her from Pittsburg to the rendezvous
</p>
<p>at the falls, while others under Colonel Bowman marched by way of
</p>

<p>among many that nearly all the warfare in Kentucky and the West was

<p>the result of merely individual effort. But, so far from that being the

<p>case, the men engaged in all this fighting acted as a part of the regular

<p>paid by that state. Formal reports of the ammunition and commissary

<p>supplies furnished to Boonesboro, Harrod's, and St. Asaphs were made

<p>CHAPTER III.
</p>
<p>The Indian Question at the Close op the Revolution  Efforts op
</p>
<p>Congress to Preserve Peace They are Rendered Ineffective
</p>
<p>BY the Jealousy of the States.
</p>
<p>That during the Revolution the Indian aggressions upon
</p>
<p>the Iventuckians were inspired and aided, and even
</p>
<p>planned and led by the Eritish, is not open to dispute. It
</p>
<p>was fondly hoped that, upon the conclusion of the defini-
</p>
<p>tive treaty of peace in 1783, the ratification of which, by
</p>
<p>the parties was exchanged in May, 1784, the British mili-
</p>
<p>tary posts in the north-west would be at once surrendered,
</p>
<p>and that the Americans would then be able to control the
</p>
<p>Indians. But one of the articles of the treaty prohibited
</p>
<p>tbe British from carrying away slaves belonging to the
</p>
<p>citizens of any of the States, and this was disregarded ;
</p>
<p>the British contending that the agreement did not apply
</p>
<p>to negroes who had been previously freed by acts of
</p>
<p>war, and denying that they had taken away any others.
</p>
<p>While there may have been force in their argument, it is
</p>
<p>unquestionable that some of the negroes carried ofi" by
</p>
<p>them were not in their hands, and had not become free
</p>
<p>by the acts of war, at the time the treaty was signed. It
</p>
<p>was also agreed in the treaty, that Congress would recom-
</p>
<p>mend to the States the repeal of all laws which interposed
</p>
<p>obstacles to the recovery of debts due to British citizens;
</p>
<p>and this Congress did, but, having no power to enforce
</p>
<p>this advice, it was rejected by several of the States, and no-
</p>
<p>tably by Virginia. It is probable that Great Britain had
</p>
<p>never entirely abandoned the hope of regaining the coun-
</p>
<p>try west of the AUeghanies, or, at least, of separating it
</p>
<p>from the Atlantic States, and of extending over it her
</p>
<p>protection. At any rate, the failure by Virginia and other
</p>
<p>States to repeal their laws obstructing the collection of

</p>
<p>debts due to British citizens, was made the pretext for re-
</p>
<p>The. Spanish Conspiracy. 47
</p>
<p>fusing to surrender the military posts on the northern
</p>
<p>frontier, which were within the acknowledged limits of the
</p>
<p>United States as defined in the treaty of 1783. For a time
</p>
<p>after the declaration of peace the Indians continued pa-
</p>
<p>cific in their actions, if not in their intentions. But hav-
</p>
<p>ing never acknowledged the sovereignty of Great Britain,
</p>
<p>nor having ever been conquered by the United States, they
</p>
<p>found it impossible to comprehend how a treaty between
</p>
<p>those powers, with which they had had nothing to do, could
</p>
<p>extend over them the dominion of one of the parties thereto.
</p>
<p>They were divided into many tribes having between them
</p>
<p>no bond, while the 'several tribal organizations themselves,
</p>
<p>sometimes strong in the numbers and prowess of their
</p>
<p>warriors, were always Aveak in the absence of power to
</p>
<p>control the vicious of their own members. Thus it often
</p>
<p>happened that, while the great mass of the Indians might
</p>
<p>desire peace, a single tribe would be resolved on war ; or,
</p>
<p>that a few bad men in a tribe would engage in rapine, for
</p>
<p>which the larger portion of the tribe were not willingly
</p>
<p>responsible. Nor was the wrong all on one side. In a
</p>
<p>country situated as Kentucky then was, it was inevitable
</p>
<p>that it should become a place of refuge for a full quota of
</p>
<p>the lawless from other sections, who found a vent upon the
</p>
<p>red men for their murderous and predatory passions. The
</p>
<p>savage blows in Kentucky invariably descended upon the
</p>
<p>innocent ; and, if reprisal was sought by the whites across
</p>
<p>the river, the chances were a hundred to one that the
</p>
<p>guilty escaped while the unofiending perished. Thus, un-
</p>
<p>der conditions of a nominal peace, occurrences having all
</p>
<p>the features of the most horrible and relentless war were
</p>
<p>only too frequent ; and though these were individual rather
</p>
<p>than general, they were not the less potent to keep the
</p>
<p>passions of the populations on both sides of the river in a
</p>
<p>condition of constant irritation. It is true that the acts

<p>which occasioned so much recrimination and retaliation
</p>
<p>were often and designedly exaggerated ; yet enough was
</p>
<p>real and undoubted to constitute a serious grievance which
</p>
<p>loudly called for action and redress. That the Indians on
</p>
<p>their part were incited and encouraged by the retention of

<p>48 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>the posts by the British is certain ; and the charge was as
</p>
<p>sincerely believed as it was generally made at the time, that,
</p>
<p>after the declaration of peace, the murders and depreda-
</p>
<p>tions by the savages in Kentucky were directly aided and
</p>
<p>countenanced by his majesty's officers at Detroit and else-
</p>
<p>where.
</p>
<p>Upon the cessation of hostilities with Great Britain,
</p>
<p>Congress found itself immediately confronted by this In-
</p>
<p>dian question : Should a war of extermination be waged
</p>
<p>against these powerful tril5es, which would be swiftly
</p>
<p>bound together by common danger ; or should a pacific
</p>
<p>policy be pursued and an honest effi)rf be made to concili-
</p>
<p>ate them by a course of justice and forbearance ? The
</p>
<p>latter alternative was wisely chosen. But what was the
</p>
<p>Congress which made this election ? At the conception
</p>
<p>of the Revolution, Congress began to conduct the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment, without any real authority, but its legislation was
</p>
<p>generally accepted by the States under the pressure of
</p>
<p>stern necessity ; yet the central authority existed only by
</p>
<p>sufferance and might at any time be set at naught by the
</p>
<p>caprice or selfishness of the States. The public exigency
</p>
<p>demanded something more stable; the plan for a perpet-
</p>
<p>ual union under the Articles of Confederation was re-
</p>
<p>ported, adopted and submitted to the States for ratifica-
</p>
<p>tion, but that ratification was not finally completed by the
</p>
<p>action of Maryland until nearly the close of the Revolu-
</p>
<p>tion. When this was done the government thereby
</p>
<p>formed amounted to little more than a mere agency for in-
</p>
<p>dependent States, wanting in all the essentials of actual au-
</p>
<p>thority and real power. The executive as well as the leg-
</p>
<p>islative functions were vested in Congress ; for a general
</p>
<p>judiciary no provision was made. No treaty could be
</p>
<p>valid unless ratified by nine of the States; no act of legis-
</p>
<p>lation was complete without the consent of an equal num-

<p>ber. Even then the central authority was lacking in the
</p>
<p>auxiliary machinery necessary to the strict enforcement of
</p>
<p>the treaties so made or of the laws so enacted. Saddled
</p>
<p>with the duty of providing for the payment of the war
</p>
<p>debt. Congress was not clothed with authority to levy or
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 49
</p>
<p>enforce the collection of taxes necessary to that end, but
</p>
<p>could only recommend to the States the levying of those
</p>
<p>taxes, which some of them did promptly, while others
</p>
<p>were dilatory, and some absolutely refused. It had the ex-
</p>
<p>clusive power of making peace or declaring war; but
</p>
<p>could neither raise nor equip an army, nor provide for its
</p>
<p>support when put in the field. That had to be done by
</p>
<p>and through the actions of the States, which might raise
</p>
<p>the men and provide the money at once to meet the exi-
</p>
<p>gency ; or dally with the importunity ; or altogether de-
</p>
<p>cline, as was dictated by a sense of duty, or by mean cen-
</p>
<p>soriousness and jealousy, or by the caprice of demagogues
</p>
<p>for the time in the ascendant. The desire of independ-
</p>
<p>ence and the authority of Washington surmounted all
</p>
<p>these difficulties in the Revolution ; but when the imme-
</p>
<p>diate necessity impelling to exertion and sacrifice was
</p>
<p>withdrawn, the Government was on every side balked and
</p>
<p>thwarted from the beginning, and the condition of public
</p>
<p>affairs soon became one bordering on chaos. In the midst
</p>
<p>of all the difficulties by which it was beset, the Govern-
</p>
<p>ment was denounced as imbecile and disgraced, by the
</p>
<p>very men who were the most open and active in setting at
</p>
<p>defiance its just and necessary authority, and who were
</p>
<p>the most potent factors, by their villification, contumacy
</p>
<p>and plots, in rendering it " despised abroad " and causing
</p>
<p>it to be " disobeyed at home ;" and yet who, as naturally as
</p>
<p>inconsistently, preferred it, and preferred it for that very
</p>
<p>reason, to the new union, the Constitution of which they
</p>
<p>did all in their power to defeat, which they sought by con-
</p>
<p>struction to render even more despicable than the Confed-
</p>
<p>eration had ever been, and the friends of which they never
</p>
<p>ceased to revile. And it was inevitable that, in later years,
</p>
<p>the weak and sycophantic apologists for men who con-
</p>
<p>stantly misrepresented the actions and motives of the Gov-

<p>ernment should find, in this denial to it of necessary pow-
</p>
<p>ers, a justification for the corrupt intrigues and treasonable
</p>
<p>conspiracies by which they sought to divide the Union on
</p>
<p>the very eve of its birth. [See Butler, page 172.] It was

</p>
<p>most fortunate for the hopes which depended upon suc-
</p>
<p>cess in surmounting all these difficulties, that there were
</p>
<p>others who had from the beginning viewed with alarm
</p>
<p>these defects, and had urged with sagacious patriotism
</p>
<p>the formation of a government clothed with power to en-
</p>
<p>force its own laws and to defend its own life ; who, while
</p>
<p>striving to apply the needed remedy, loyally upheld the
</p>
<p>weak hands of the only government they had which rep-
</p>
<p>resented even the shadow of American nationality ; who
</p>
<p>remembered with gratitude that, even such as it was, it
</p>
<p>was under this government their strong arms had wrested
</p>
<p>their independence from the British king, and that, until
</p>
<p>a better could be devised and adopted, upon its support
</p>
<p>the maintenance of that independence solely rested; who,
</p>
<p>therefore, while always striving for something stronger
</p>
<p>than this " mere rope of sand," bore with patience the
</p>
<p>shortcomings that were inevitable under the existing con-
</p>
<p>ditions ; wdio felt themselves linked with hooks stronger
</p>
<p>than those of steel to their sister States, by all their mutual
</p>
<p>sufferings and common sacrifices of blood and treasure in
</p>
<p>the war which the equal gallantry of all had brought to a
</p>
<p>glorious issue; and in whose hearts the sacred flame of
</p>
<p>patriotism was ever kept brightly burning.
</p>
<p>Complaints made to Congress on behalf of whites in
</p>
<p>Kentucky of robberies and murders perpetrated by the
</p>
<p>Indians, were met by counter complaints from the agents
</p>
<p>appointed by Congress of outrages by whites upon peace-
</p>
<p>able Indians in Tennessee, Ohio, and Indiana. While the
</p>
<p>whites insisted that the Indians were wholly to blame, the
</p>
<p>Indians could with justice retort that the murders of whites
</p>
<p>were by lawless red men for whom they were not responsi-
</p>
<p>ble ; that these murders were perpetrated in retaliation, and
</p>
<p>that the blows which fell upon themselves were inflicted
</p>
<p>on the wholly innocent. While the whites had the greater

</p>
<p>degree of justice on their side, and had suffered the more
</p>
<p>seriously, the representations of the Indian agents were
</p>
<p>entitled to weight and had a basis of truth'. To distin-
</p>
<p>guish the guilty Indians was impossible, nor could it be
</p>
<p>always determined to what tribes they belonged. Con-

</p>
<p>gress had but just inaugurated what was designed as a pacific
</p>
<p>policy; an invasion of the Indian territory by any large
</p>
<p>body of troops and striking indiscriminately at the Indians
</p>
<p>would have been inconsistent with all these professions
</p>
<p>and have kindled a general war. In the meantime, the
</p>
<p>settlers in Kentucky were naturally restive under their
</p>
<p>many grievances. Congress was not indifferent to their
</p>
<p>sufferings, but the jealousy of the States refused to Con-
</p>
<p>gress the means of efficient action. If Congress moved
</p>
<p>more slowly than was demanded by conditions apparent to
</p>
<p>Kentuckians, the embarrassment and perplexity of the
</p>
<p>situation as it appeared to Congress, as well as the defi-
</p>
<p>ciency of means at the disposal of Congress, should be
</p>
<p>remembered. The idea which was then promulgated by
</p>
<p>demagogues, that the failure to act as expeditiously and
</p>
<p>as vigorously as the occasion appeared to them to demand,
</p>
<p>proceeded from hostility to the western people on the part
</p>
<p>of their countrymen in the east, from a callous indifference
</p>
<p>to their sufferings and grievances, or from an unnatural
</p>
<p>sympathy with the Indians and prejudice against the
</p>
<p>whites in the conflict, will not now be received with favor
</p>
<p>by the unbiased historian nor be countenanced by the
</p>
<p>candid thinker.
</p>
<p>Pursuing the policy of pacification which had been de-
</p>
<p>termined upon, in March, 1784, George Rogers Clark,
</p>
<p>Richard Butler, N'athaniel Greene, Oliver Walcott and
</p>
<p>Stephen Higginson were appointed by Congress to nego-
</p>
<p>tiate with the red men. Higginson and Greene declining
</p>
<p>to act, Arthur Lee and Benjamin Lincoln were appointed
</p>
<p>in their places. The necessity for protecting the commis-
</p>
<p>sioners by an armed force pending the negotiations upon
</p>
<p>which they were directed to enter, occasioned the intro-
</p>
<p>duction of several propositions to provide the requisite
</p>
<p>troops ; but, after prolonged debate in Congress, the best

<p>that could be done was to secure a recommendation to the
</p>
<p>States to furnish seven hundred men from their militia,
</p>
<p>three hundred of whom were to be used in the immediate
</p>
<p>protection of the commissioners. In the following Octo-
</p>
<p>ber, a treaty of peace and friendship was concluded with
</p>
<p>52 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>the Six Nations at Fort Stanwix by Butler, "Walcott and
</p>
<p>Lee ; and in January, 1785, a similar treaty wdtli "Wyan-
</p>
<p>dottes, Chippewas, Delawares and Ottawas was concluded
</p>
<p>at Fort Mcintosh by Butler, Clark and Lee. In March of
</p>
<p>the same year additional commissioners were appointed to
</p>
<p>treat with the Southern Indians, and in N"ovember a treaty
</p>
<p>was negotiated by Benjamin Hawkins, Andrew Pickens,
</p>
<p>Joseph Martin and Lauchlan Mcintosh, with the Cher-
</p>
<p>okees, at Hopewell ; which was followed in January, 1786,
</p>
<p>by treaties with the Choctaws and Chickasaws, negotiated
</p>
<p>by the same commissioners. The circle was completed by
</p>
<p>a treaty concluded in January, 1786, at the mouth of the
</p>
<p>Miami, with the Shawanese and some of the Delawares
</p>
<p>and Wyandottes, by Butler, Clark and Parsons, the last
</p>
<p>named having taken the place of Lincoln.* However
</p>
<p>well intentioned these philanthropic measures were, they
</p>
<p>did not cause a cessation of individual warfare between
</p>
<p>the Kentuckians and Indians. A large number of the
</p>
<p>Shawanese, who had been coerced by the treaty at the
</p>
<p>mouth of the Miami to acknowledge the absolute sover-
</p>
<p>eignty of the United States over the whole country ceded
</p>
<p>by Great Britain ; to yield up the ownership of large tracts
</p>
<p>of their most valuable lands on the east side of the Miami
</p>
<p>to the United States for settlement by the whites ; and to
</p>
<p>receive as a g7^ant from the United States the lands on the
</p>
<p>west of the Miami, of which they had had the undisputed
</p>
<p>possession for ages, were incensed at those provisions, and
</p>
<p>wreaked their vengeance upon the Kentuckians. The
</p>
<p>Indians on the Wabash further to the west, who had never
</p>
<p>entered into any of these treaties, had their apprehensions
</p>
<p>and jealousies excited to fever heat by the various meas-
</p>
<p>ures indicating a purpose by the whites to settle upon

<p>scene with Kew-Kewepellethe, which has been attributed to Clark by

<p>Judge Hall. The account given by Butler was written on the very day
</p>
<p>of its occurrence. The journal in question was given to the publisher

<p>of the " Olden Time," by General Butler's son, the gallant Captain

</p>
<p>their territory, and continued their hostile aggressions.
</p>
<p>In the meantime bands of white men traversing the
</p>
<p>country on both sides of the river rarely met an Indian
</p>
<p>without killing him ; and their acts were retaliated upon
</p>
<p>the people of the district. These harassments and out-
</p>
<p>rages became so frequent and grievous, that the county
</p>
<p>lieutenants made an earnest and spirited representation to
</p>
<p>Patrick Henry, then the Governor, soliciting protection ;
</p>
<p>and, as Virginia herself possessed no technical right, with-
</p>
<p>out the authority of Congress, to authorize a hostile expe-
</p>
<p>dition into the territory north of the Ohio, which she had
</p>
<p>previously ceded to the central government, these com-
</p>
<p>plaints and demands for redress were in time laid before
</p>
<p>Congress. The treaties recently made, the complaints re-
</p>
<p>ceived of aggressions by the whites upon the Indians,
</p>
<p>combined with the inherent weakness and lack of means
</p>
<p>of the central authority '^o prevent immediate action by
</p>
<p>Congress. During the summer of 1786, Governor Henry
</p>
<p>informed the people of Kentucky that he had represented
</p>
<p>their situation to Congress, and had urged the adoption of
</p>
<p>measures for their protection ; but in a private letter to
</p>
<p>Benjamin Logan he stated the inaction of Congress. At
</p>
<p>the same time he gave general directions to the county lieu-
</p>
<p>tenants, instructing them " to adopt the necessary means
</p>
<p>of defense;"  which, as no one had ever doubted their
</p>
<p>perfect right under the laws to resist attack and repel in-
</p>
<p>vasion, was construed to authorize offensive operations as
</p>
<p>the most effectual means of defense. A meeting of militia
</p>
<p>officers was held at Harrodsburg. Benjamin Logan, who
</p>
<p>was the senior county lieutenant, and as such was entitled
</p>
<p>to command, gave his opinion that George Rogers Clark,
</p>
<p>who was not then in commission, should be called on to
</p>
<p>lead them, and, under this advice, Clark was placed at the
</p>
<p>head of a force of a thousand men, who speedily assembled

</p>
<p>and marched for the rendezvous at Clarksville, opposite
</p>
<p>the Falls. In the meantime, as doubts were entertained
</p>
<p>of the power of county lieutenants to impress men, pro-
</p>
<p>visions and supplies, that question was submitted to the
</p>
<p>judges of the district court, who gave a written opinion
</p>
<p>54 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>that all the power possessed by the assembly was dele-
</p>
<p>gated to and vested in the county lieutenants. Prior to the
</p>
<p>levying and mobilization of this force, the slowly moving
</p>
<p>Congress had responded to the appeals of Governor Henry
</p>
<p>by sending to the Falls two companies of regulars, out of
</p>
<p>the few placed under their control by the jealous states,
</p>
<p>and upon the 30th of June had authorized the raising of
</p>
<p>the militia of Kentucky, and the invasion of the country
</p>
<p>of the mischief makers, under the command of the leading
</p>
<p>United States officer [Western Annals]. "While, there-
</p>
<p>fore, the expedition, which was originally designed as
</p>
<p>against the Wabash Indians, was not organized nor un-
</p>
<p>dertaken under these orders of Congress, yet these
</p>

<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 55
</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV.
</p>
<p>The Initial Struggles of Kentucky for Autonomy.
</p>
<p>For some years prior to the treaty of peace with Great
</p>
<p>Britain, Benjamin Logan had been second only to Clark
</p>
<p>in command and influence ; he was " second to none, per-
</p>
<p>haps, in the peculiar military talents which the defense of
</p>
<p>this country at that time required." When Clark was re-
</p>
<p>tired from his position as a general officer in the service of
</p>
<p>Virginia, the direction of military affairs in the district
</p>
<p>devolved upon Logan, as senior colonel and senior county
</p>
<p>lieutenant (of Lincoln county). In 1784, he received in-
</p>
<p>formation of a proposed invasion of the district by the
</p>
<p>Cherokees in large numbers. Whether the intelligence
</p>
<p>was purely sensational, or the project was abandoned, can
</p>
<p>not positively be affirmed ; but that Logan gave full credit
</p>
<p>to the communications made to him is as certain as that
</p>
<p>the invasion itself was never actually made. On his own
</p>
<p>responsibility he issued a call for a meeting of the ofiicers
</p>
<p>of all the several military organizations of the district, to
</p>
<p>be held in Danville in November, 1784, for the purpose of
</p>
<p>consultation upon measures necessary to repel the threat-
</p>
<p>ened attack, or to anticipate it by carrying war home to
</p>
<p>the Cherokee country. The sense of the meeting was
</p>
<p>unanimous that the true policy of defense was not to await
</p>
<p>the torch and tomahawk of the Indians at the hearths of
</p>
<p>the detached settlers, but by ofiensive operations to fight
</p>
<p>the battle in the Indian country. But no one was author-
</p>
<p>ized to order such an expedition ; and, if ordered, there
</p>
<p>were no laws providing for calling out the militia, to pay
</p>
<p>for provisions, or for the services of ofiicers or men, nor to
</p>
<p>purchase the necessary ammunition ; and it was felt that
</p>
<p>the danger \^~as not sufiiciently apparent nor immediate to

</p>
<p>ments. So tlie contemplated movement was abandoned.*
</p>
<p>This meeting of militia officers called by Logan issued a
</p>
<p>circular address to the people of the district, recommend-
</p>
<p>ing that on a day named each militia company should
</p>
<p>elect one representative, to meet at Danville, on the 27th
</p>
<p>of December, 1784, to take into consideration the same
</p>
<p>important question of self defense. This meeting was
</p>
<p>held at the time and place designated, and was presided
</p>
<p>over by William Fleming, who is briefly described in the
</p>
<p>"Political Beginnings" as "an influential citizen. "f The
</p>
<p>* In this connection it may be regarded as worthy of note, that, on
</p>
<p>the 22d of May preceding this meeting, James Speed, the grandfather
</p>
<p>of Mr. Lincoln's attorney-general of the same name, who had been ap-
</p>
<p>pointed a magistrate at the urgent solicitation of Willis Green, the clerk
</p>
<p>of Lincoln, wrote from his home in that county to Gov. Harrison:
</p>
<p>"Many of the inhabitants of this place (Danville?) are not natives of
</p>
<p>Virginia, nor well affected to its government, and are sowing sedition
</p>
<p>among its inhabitants as fast as they can, which I fear will have too
</p>
<p>great an effect so long as we are pent up in forts and stations, notwith-
</p>
<p>standing the attorney-general (Walker Daniel) has taken every step in
</p>
<p>his power to suppress them. ... I fear the faction will increase,
</p>
<p>and ere long we shall revolt from government in order to try if we can
</p>
<p>govern ourselves, which, in my opinion, will be jumping out of the fry-
</p>
<p>ing pan into the fire." [ Virginia State Papers.}
</p>
<p>tCol. William Fleming was a native of Scotland, and was educated
</p>
<p>as a physician. He came to America after the Braddock campaign, but
</p>
<p>saw some military service before the conclusion of the French and
</p>
<p>Indian war. He settled in Bottetourt county, Va., and commanded the
</p>
<p>regiment from that county at Point Pleasant, where he was wounded.
</p>
<p>He was long a member of the Virginia assembly and council, and in
</p>
<p>1881 was for a time acting governor of that state. He was a large land
</p>
<p>owner in Kentucky, and at the time represented in the Virginia senate
</p>
<p>the district which included all Kentucky as well as Bottetourt, and a
</p>
<p>number of other counties in the valley and South-western Virginia. He

<p>came to Kentucky in 1779 as one of a commission to provide for the exe-
</p>
<p>cution of the statute to regulate the claims to land in the district. He
</p>
<p>returned to Kentucky in the fall of 1782, with Samuel McDowell,
</p>
<p>Thomas Marshall and Caleb Wallace, who, with him, constituted a com-
</p>
<p>mission to settle the accounts of the officers engaged in the several ex-
</p>
<p>peditions against the Indians. He did not settle in Kentucky, but,
</p>
<p>being here at the time the meeting of 1784 was held, his ofiicial position
</p>
<p>as the senator of the district naturally suggested him as a suitable per-
</p>
<p>son to preside over its deliberations. Col. Fleming's wife was a sister of
</p>
<p>Col. William Christian. The present William B. Fleming, of Louisville,
</p>
<p>is their great grandson.

</p>
<p>meeting was animated by patriotism ; its conduct was
</p>
<p>marked by decorum. In its judgment many of the ob-
</p>
<p>stacles to that vigorous defense of the district which was
</p>
<p>sought by its members could be remedied by suitable leg-
</p>
<p>islation by the general assembly ; but others, and those the
</p>
<p>most serious^, from the essential nature of the situation
</p>
<p>could only be overcome by a separation from Virginia and
</p>
<p>the erection of the district into an independent member of
</p>
<p>the confederation.
</p>
<p>These opinions were embodied in a resolution in favor
</p>
<p>of applying to the General Assembly for legislation ren-
</p>
<p>dering Kentucky independent of Virginia. This met
</p>
<p>with opposition from many, whom the suggested action
</p>
<p>filled with strong forebodings. The meeting, therefore,
</p>
<p>modestly forbearing to make the contemplated application
</p>
<p>to the General Assembly, earnestly recommended to the
</p>
<p>people, that, at their regular elections for members of the
</p>
<p>Virginia Assembly, in the ensuing April, they should
</p>
<p>choose delegates to meet in convention at Danville, in
</p>
<p>May, for the express purpose of considering and deciding
</p>
<p>the question of an application for the suggested sepa-
</p>
<p>ration. Accordingly, twenty-five delegates were elected
</p>
<p>from the counties of Fayette, Jefferson, Lincoln and Nel-
</p>
<p>son, into which the district had then been divided, and or-
</p>
<p>ganized by the election of Col. Samuel McDowell,* as
</p>
<p>* A sketch of Col. McDowell may be found in " Historic Families of
</p>
<p>Kentucky," by the writer of these pages. In his "Border Warfare, "
</p>
<p>Withers states that John McDowell was a private soldier in the French
</p>
<p>and Indian war, in the company commanded by Lewis. The list of the
</p>
<p>soldiers published in Henings' Statutes shows that it was Samuel. Both
</p>
<p>Arbuckle and Stuart omit the name of McDowell from the list of cap-
</p>
<p>tains who fought at Point Pleasant. A news letter written at the time
</p>
<p>and published in Belfast, as well as the account given of the battle by
</p>
<p>Isaac Shelby, shows that one of the captains who, after Fleming and

</p>
<p>Lewis had fallen, advanced with Field and checked the triumphant In-
</p>
<p>dians, was McDowell ; and the records of the convention of 1776, of which
</p>
<p>he was a useful member, prove that Samuel McDowell commanded a com-
</p>
<p>pany in that battle. Peyton, in his "History of Augusta County," states that
</p>
<p>Major Alexander Stuart commanded the regiment of Virginia militia,
</p>
<p>from Augusta and Rockbridge, which did such gallant service at the
</p>
<p>battle of Guilford Court House,  commanded it in the absence of Col.

<p>president and Thomas Todd as secretary. Of this con-
</p>
<p>vention, George Winter, Christopher Greenup, James
</p>
<p>Speed, Robert Todd, Robert Johnson, Caleb Wallace, Ben-
</p>
<p>jamin Logan, Willis Green, Hary Innes, Levi Todd,
</p>
<p>Richard Taylor, James Garrard and John Edwards were
</p>
<p>members. It was decided that a separation from Virginia
</p>
<p>by constitutional methods, and admission as an equal
</p>
<p>member into the confederation, were desirable; that a pe-
</p>
<p>tition to the General Assembly in accordance with this
</p>
<p>judgment be prepared; that an address to the people ot
</p>
<p>the district be published ; and that the proceedings of the
</p>
<p>convention, the petition and the address be referred to
</p>
<p>another convention composed of delegates to be elected in
</p>
<p>July, 1785, and to meet in Danville in the following Au-
</p>
<p>gust. The acts of the convention were direct; the lan-
</p>
<p>guage employed was free from ambiguity; and there is
</p>
<p>evidence in what w^as done of an absence of ulterior de-
</p>
<p>signs. The convention could have acted immediately as
</p>
<p>well as refer its proceedings to another similar body.
</p>
<p>Marshall attributes its failure to do so and the delicate con-
</p>
<p>servatism of its course to an uncertainty of an approval
</p>
<p>by the people, among whom there was far more pro-
</p>
<p>nounced opposition to the separation than there was
</p>
<p>among the members of the convention. The petition to
</p>
<p>the Assembly, calm and temperate, and exhibiting no
</p>
<p>efibrt at display, breathed the true spirit of the resolutions
</p>
<p>which had been adopted, basing the application for sepa-
</p>
<p>ration upon the local situation and the grievances neces-
</p>
<p>sarily resulting therefrom, and dwelling but briefly and
</p>
<p>without exaggeration upon them in detail. The address
</p>
<p>to the people, somewhat warmer in tone, was evidently in-
</p>
<p>tended to impress upon them a deeper sense of injury than
</p>
<p>the people themselves had yet entertained. It indicates
</p>
<p>that the members of the convention were conscious of be-

<p>Samuel McDowell, who was sick at the time. The journal kept by Rev.
</p>
<p>Samuel Houston, who was a private in that regiment, clearly shows that
</p>
<p>Col. McDowell commanded his own regiment in thatengagement,which

<p>is confirmed by McDowell's letter concerning the battle, published in

<p>iu^ in advance of their constituents in their desire for sep-
</p>
<p>aration, and deemed it necessary to expatiate upon their
</p>
<p>grievances, the extent of which the people might not oth-
</p>
<p>erwise comprehend. It is known tliat this address was
</p>
<p>drawn by James Wilkinson, who was a spectator, though
</p>
<p>not a member, of the convention, and who had the pre-
</p>
<p>ceding fall come to Kentucky from Philadelphia in order
</p>
<p>to engage in commercial pursuits. He was dissatisfied
</p>
<p>with the address to the Assembly as too tame and moder-
</p>
<p>ate. It was by his counsel the convention of August
</p>
<p>was called. That convention was chiefly composed of
</p>
<p>members who sat in the one preceding; but Green and
</p>
<p>Greenup did not have seats in it, and among the new mem-
</p>
<p>bers were Wilkinson, John Coburn and Robert Patter-
</p>
<p>son. McDowell was president and Todd secretary. The
</p>
<p>petition to the Assembly adopted by the convention of
</p>
<p>May was never sent to that body. It was completely ig-
</p>
<p>nored by the convention of August, to which, by the man-
</p>
<p>agement of Wilkinson, it had been referred. In lieu there-
</p>
<p>of, one less simple, abounding in rhetorical flourishes, and
</p>
<p>having an entirely difl:erent tone, of which Wilkinson
</p>
<p>himself was the author, was adopted and forwarded. It
</p>
<p>was less a petition than a demand. The Assembly was
</p>
<p>asked to pass an act " declaring and acknowledging the
</p>
<p>independence of the district ; " expression was given to
</p>
<p>the " persuasion " that the independent and sovereign
</p>
<p>state acknowledged " would as cheerfully be received into
</p>
<p>the continental union on the recommendation of our parent
</p>
<p>state."
</p>
<p>The declaration and acknowledgment of sovereignty
</p>
<p>and independence asked for was not at all to be contin-
</p>
<p>gent upon the admission into the confederation of the
</p>
<p>State sought to be erected. Whether the schemer even
</p>
<p>then contemplated and endeavored to prepare for a sepa-

<p>ration from the Union as well as from Virginia, which two
</p>
<p>years later he engaged to promote, is not important. If
</p>
<p>80, he had few, if any, confidants, and at the time he was
</p>
<p>not suspected of illicit design ; the large majority of the

<p>convention, as well as of the masses of the people, were in-

</p>
<p>dubitably true to the Union. It was arranged that this
</p>
<p>petition should be presented to and be urged upon the
</p>
<p>Assembly by George Muter and  Hary Innes.* An-
</p>
<p>other address to the people, more exciting, impassioned
</p>
<p>and exaggerated in expression and tone than the one
</p>
<p>which preceded it, and well calculated to subserve its
</p>
<p>author's design of inflaming the minds of those to whom
</p>
<p>it was directed, was adopted and circulated. This, too,
</p>
<p>was written by the controlling spirit of the convention 
</p>
<p>Wilkinson. The second resolution of this address was an
</p>
<p>argument for, and plainly implied, an assumption by the
</p>
<p>district of that sovereignty and independence which the
</p>
<p>petition to the assembly requested that body to declare
</p>
<p>and acknowledge. The report of the Committee of the
</p>
<p>Whole, into which the convention resolved itself, was
</p>
<p>modeled after the Declaration of Independence. The as-
</p>
<p>sertion made therein, that " The law imposing a tax of
</p>
<p>five shillings per hundred acres, on lands previously sold,
</p>
<p>and directing the payment thereof into the Register's
</p>
<p>office at Richmond, before the patent shall issue, is equally
</p>
<p>subversive of justice as any of the statutes of the British
</p>
<p>Parliament, that impelled the good people to arms," is
</p>
<p>noteworthy as an illustration as well of the animus by
</p>
<p>which it was dictated as of the inflated and exaggerated
</p>
<p>tone of the entire report.
</p>
<p>Whatever may have been thought by the General As-
</p>
<p>sembly of the tone of those papers, the existence of griev-
</p>
<p>ances as serious as they were real, was apparent to all.
</p>
<p>The justice of the request for a separation was promptly
</p>
<p>recognized by the passage of an act in January, 1786, f for
</p>
<p>*The statement made by Marshall and others that Muter was at the
</p>
<p>time Chief Justice of the district is an error. Cyrus Griffin had been
</p>
<p>elected to that position at the session of the General Assembly preceding
</p>
<p>this convention, but refused to accept. While attending the following

</p>
<p>session of that body, Muter was elected Judge of the General Court to
</p>
<p>fill the vacancy occasioned by Griffin's declination. Innes at the time
</p>
<p>was Attorney-General of the district. During the session acts for his
</p>
<p>benefit were passed by the Assembly.
</p>
<p>TMr. Madison, who was a member of the House Committee on Courts
</p>
<p>of Justice, from which the act in question was first reported, was its au-

</p>
<p>the separation and erection of the district into a State of
</p>
<p>the Confederation. Provision was therein made for an
</p>
<p>election in the ensuing August of representatives to a
</p>
<p>fifth convention, to be held at Danville on the fourth Mon-
</p>
<p>day of September, 1786, which, after organization, was to
</p>
<p>determine " whether it be expedient for, and the will of
</p>
<p>the good people of the said district, to be erected into an
</p>
<p>independent State," on terms and conditions as defined in
</p>
<p>the act. If the said convention approved " of the erec-
</p>
<p>tion of the district into an independent State, on the fore-
</p>
<p>going terms and conditions," they were empowered " to
</p>
<p>fix a day posterior to the first day of September, 1787," on
</p>
<p>which the authority of Virginia should " cease and deter-
</p>
<p>mine forever." But the fundamental condition precedent
</p>
<p>was wisely annexed, " That p>rior to the first day of June,
</p>
<p>1787, the United States, in Congress assembled, shall as-
</p>
<p>sent to the erection of the said district into an independ-
</p>
<p>ent State, . . . and shall agree that immediately after
</p>
<p>the day to be fixed as aforesaid, posterior to the first day
</p>
<p>of September, 1787, or at some convenient time future
</p>
<p>thereto, the new State shall be admitted into the Federal
</p>
<p>Union." [Henniug, vol. xii, page 37-40.] Thus, every
</p>
<p>thing was made contingent upon the previous action of
</p>
<p>Congress assenting to the statehood of Kentucky and
</p>
<p>providing for her admission into the Union. And, " in
</p>
<p>order that no period of anarchy " might " happen to the
</p>
<p>good people of the proposed State, the convention to meet
</p>
<p>in September, 1786, was required to take measures for the
</p>
<p>election and assemblage of another convention," ."at some
</p>
<p>thor in the original form. It was amended in the House, and was
</p>
<p>passed by that body January 6, 1786. James Garrard was designated
</p>
<p>as the messenger to inform the Senate of this action, but the duty was
</p>
<p>actually performed by Christopher Greenup. On the next day, Janu-
</p>
<p>ary 7th, the bill was referred to a committee, of whom General Henry

<p>Lee was one, and John Brown, who had succeeded Colonel William
</p>
<p>Fleming as the Senator from the district which included Kentucky, was
</p>
<p>another. On the 10th, Mr. Brown reported that the committee had,
</p>
<p>"according to order, had the said bill under consideration, and had
</p>
<p>made no amendment thereto." It was then passed by the Senate, and

<p>time prior to the day fixed for the determination of the au-
</p>
<p>thority of this Commonwealth . . . and posterior to
</p>
<p>the first day of June, 1787, . . . with full power and
</p>
<p>authority to frame and establish a fundamental constitu-
</p>
<p>tion of government for the proposed State, and to declare
</p>
<p>what laws shall he enforced therein until the same shall be
</p>
<p>abrogated or altered " by the authority acting under the
</p>
<p>constitution thus adopted. The act was forwarded to the
</p>
<p>members of Congress from Virginia, who were instructed
</p>
<p>to use their endeavors to secure from Congress the nec-
</p>
<p>essary assent and provision for the admission of Kentucky
</p>
<p>into the confederation.
</p>
<p>It will be seen that this act was not what had been asked
</p>
<p>for, or demanded, in the petition drawn by Wilkinson.
</p>
<p>That petition requested the declaration and recognition
</p>
<p>by Virginia of our independence and sovereignty, leaving
</p>
<p>the state so recognized and declared thereafter to find its
</p>
<p>way into the confederation. The act, on the other hand,
</p>
<p>made every thing contingent upon the previous favorable
</p>
<p>action of Congress, * while the steps required to be taken
</p>
<p>in the district necessitated delay. However vexatious this
</p>
<p>delay and this most wise and prudent condition was to
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, and may have been to others whom he had im-
</p>
<p>bued with his spirit, by the great mass of the people the
</p>
<p>well considered act of Virginia was received with patient
</p>
<p>satisfaction. A general disposition was manifested to
</p>
<p>conform to its provisions. But Wilkinson, who had
</p>
<p>drawn the request for an acknowledgment of sovereignty
</p>
<p>and independence, now urged that the circumstances of

<p>* In a letter to Washington, Mr. Madison wrote : " The apparent cool-
</p>
<p>ness of the representatives of Kentucky, as to a separation, since these
</p>
<p>terms were defined, indicates that they had some views that will not be
</p>
<p>favored by them. They dislike much to be hung upon the will of Con-
</p>
<p>gress." [Sparks' Washington, vol. 9, page 510.] Four days after the

<p>He boldly advocated the immediate declaration and as-
</p>
<p>sumption of independence and sovereignty by Kentucky,
</p>
<p>without compliance with legal formalities, without regard-
</p>
<p>ing the conditions of the act of the assembly, and without
</p>
<p>waiting for the assent of Congress or for any provision for
</p>
<p>admission into the confederation. All that, he argued,
</p>
<p>was matter for future action ; and, in the meantime, the
</p>
<p>exigency was instant. [Marshall, page 242 ; Collins, page
</p>
<p>262.] Wilkinson was active and heated in the promulga-
</p>
<p>tion of his views. He announced himself a candidate for
</p>
<p>the convention, and it was given out in speeches made by
</p>
<p>Wilkinson himself, as well as in those made by the friends
</p>
<p>who were warm and zealous in his behalf, that he would,
</p>
<p>on the first day of the election, at Lexington, address the
</p>
<p>people, in order to persuade them to an immediate separa-
</p>
<p>tion, without regaini to the conditions imposed by the act
</p>
<p>of the assembly. Many were alarmed by those utterances ;
</p>
<p>many who were in favor of the separation itself, yet
</p>
<p>deemed the evils that might be for a time continued by
</p>
<p>awaiting the time designated, and pursuing the course
</p>
<p>pointed out by the general assembly, far less to be dreaded
</p>
<p>than the consequences of this revolutionary course which
</p>
<p>Wilkinson urged. It was determined that his election
</p>
<p>should be opposed and that his heralded speech should be
</p>
<p>answered. The person selected to reply to the speech was
</p>
<p>Humphrey Marshall ; * it is probable that as a candidate

<p>* Humphrey Marshall was a son of John Marshall and Mary Quisen-

<p>married. He was born in Virginia in 1760 ; his father's circumstances
</p>
<p>were narrow, so that his early educational advantages were limited.

</p>
<p>tion of Wilkinson, In the speech made hy the latter in
</p>
<p>Lexington a number of the laws of Virginia were bitterly
</p>
<p>denounced as unjust and oppressive, and it was represented
</p>
<p>that the people of the mother commonwealth, being them-
</p>
<p>selves secure, were indifierent to the dangers experienced
</p>
<p>and to the sufferings endured by their sons and brethren
</p>
<p>in Kentucky. The perils by which they were surrounded
</p>
<p>were grossly exaggerated, as the means most likely to be
</p>
<p>successful in inciting .the people to precipitate and illegal
</p>
<p>action. They were urged to immediately cut loose from
</p>
<p>Virginia, and at once erect themselves into an independent
</p>
<p>and sovereign state, without complying with the condi-
</p>
<p>tions of the act which provided for the election they were
</p>
<p>about to hold, without obtaining the assent of Congress,
</p>
<p>and without the passage of any act for admission into the
</p>
<p>confederation. The thoroughly revolutionary principle
</p>
<p>was asserted and maintained, that the right proposed to
</p>
<p>be exerted did not proceed from- the legislation of the
</p>
<p>state, nor was it dependent thereon, but was inherent in
</p>
<p>the people of the district, and could be exercised at their
</p>
<p>discretion.
</p>
<p>These arguments were refuted and this position was
</p>
<p>vigorously assailed by his young antagonist, whose strong
</p>
<p>natural powers, in spite of the deficiency in his early ad-
</p>
<p>vantages, fully equipped him for such a debate. Taking

<p>But he was certainly in Kentucky before that time ; probably settling

<p>in the district the year before, and becoming a deputy under his uncle,

<p>cessity of a separation, the time when this should take
</p>
<p>place, and whether independence and sovereignty should
</p>
<p>be assumed as an inherent right or be regulated by the law
</p>
<p>of the parent State, became the particular subjects of con-
</p>
<p>troversy. It was shown that the aggressions of the In-
</p>
<p>dians were growing less frequent and the magnitude of
</p>
<p>the grievance from that source was decreasing, while the
</p>
<p>constant influx of population into the district was daily
</p>
<p>adding to its means and facilities for defense. And much
</p>
<p>stress was laid upon the impropriety and dangerous ten-
</p>
<p>dency of the disregard for law which would be manifested
</p>
<p>by the course advocated by Wilkinson, as well as upon the
</p>
<p>pernicious consequences of the revolutionary principle
</p>
<p>upon which it was founded. Unable to maintain the posi-
</p>
<p>tion he had assumed, Wilkinson then resorted to the subter-
</p>
<p>fuge of contending that the expression in the law, '^pos-
</p>
<p>terior to the 1st of September, 1787," which regulated
</p>
<p>the time of the separation, meant before and not after that
</p>
<p>date. In the rejoinder, his young antagonist placed the
</p>
<p>orator between the horns of a disagreeable dilemma:
</p>
<p>"Either he did not know the meaning of the word ^pos-
</p>
<p>terior' or he meant to impose upon his audience. In
</p>
<p>the one case he was unfit to guide ; in the other unsafe to
</p>
<p>follow." [Marshall, page 243.] The friends of Wilkinson
</p>
<p>prevented the opening of the polls until late in the day;
</p>
<p>and, when it was found that he received but few votes,
</p>
<p>while the bulk of those cast were bestowed upon his oppo-
</p>
<p>nent, they had the polls soon closed for the day. Those
</p>
<p>of the opposition who were thus disappointed in their
</p>
<p>purpose to vote on the first day of the election, proclaimed
</p>
<p>their intention to return and vote on the last day. (The
</p>
<p>election lasted five days.) Wilkinson's friends were driven to
</p>
<p>resort to a trick to secure his election. The militia ofiicers,
</p>
<p>who were in his interest, were induced to order musters on

<p>IN 1890.
</p>
<p>It has been stated that the militia who organized under
</p>
<p>the leadership of George Rogers Clark, in the fall of 1786,
</p>
<p>for an expedition against the hostile Indians of the
</p>
<p>"Wabash, rendezvoused at Clarksville,* Indiana, where
</p>
<p>more than a thousand men assembled early' in September.
</p>
<p>But the number not being deemed sufficient to accomplish
</p>
<p>all the objects of the expedition, a council of war was
</p>
<p>held on the 13th of September, of the field officers of the
</p>
<p>several counties, which was presided over by Benjamin
</p>
<p>Logan, and at which it was determined that a field officer
</p>
<p>from each county should return, get together all the de-
</p>
<p>serters and delinquents and collect the rest of the militia
</p>
<p>as soon as possible, and march with them to rejoin Clark
</p>
<p>at Vincennes. General Logan, Colonel Levi Todd, Colo-
</p>
<p>nel Bobert Patterson and several others were selected to
</p>
<p>execute this order. The next day, however, Clark ad-
</p>
<p>dressed to General Logan a written order directing him to
</p>
<p>assemble the militia as decided by the council of the field
</p>
<p>officers, and to impress supplies, etc. ; but, instead of re-
</p>
<p>*Virginia had given to Clark and his officers and men who captured
</p>
<p>Kaskaskia and Vincennes (1778-9) 200,000 acres of land in one body-
</p>
<p>lying along the Ohio river, in Indiana, as bounty for their services in
</p>
<p>that campaign. In the midst of this grant, the town of Clarksville was
</p>
<p>incorporated and established. It was situated opposite the Falls, at a

</p>
<p>joining liim, to march at once to surprise the Indians of
</p>
<p>the Mad River towns in Ohio, with whom Clark had as-
</p>
<p>sisted in negotiating a treaty in the preceding January (at
</p>
<p>the mouth of the Miami), but who were charged with vio-
</p>
<p>lating that treaty. Logan, Todd, Patterson and the others
</p>
<p>deputed for the purpose left Clark immediately, and pro-
</p>
<p>ceeded Avith great celerity to execute his commands. Lo-
</p>
<p>gan quickly collected his men, crossed the Ohio at Mays-
</p>
<p>ville, and, marching with equal rapidity and secrecy, would
</p>
<p>have surprised a large body of those Indians in their prin-
</p>
<p>cipal town, had it not been for the alarm given them by a
</p>
<p>deserter. As it was, a number of warriors were killed,
</p>
<p>man}^ prisoners were captured,''' and the Indian country
</p>
<p>was swept with fire. The completely successful expedition
</p>
<p>returned in twenty days.
</p>
<p>While Logan was thus performing the duty to which he
</p>
<p>had been assigned, Clark marched to Vincennes. There
</p>
<p>a delay of nine chxys ensued while awaiting the arrival of
</p>
<p>provisions and stores which liad been shipped from the
</p>
<p>Falls. When these arrived, the larger part had been
</p>
<p>spoiled. It is said that Clark opposed this delay, urging
</p>
<p>a forced march against the Indians, but was overruled by
</p>
<p>his officers, some of whom have been charged with excit-
</p>
<p>ing the men to mutiny. In spite of the considerable dis-
</p>
<p>afi'eetion which was at once manifested, the march towards
</p>
<p>the Indian country was resumed, on short rations, until,
</p>
<p>after two or three days of discontent, nearly one-third of
</p>
<p>his men refused to proceed further, and, led by their offi-
</p>
<p>cers, determined to return to Vincennes. iS'otwithstanding
</p>
<p>this defection, the force remaining with Clark numbered
</p>
<p>more than six hundred gallant men, a larger and better
</p>
<p>equipped body than any of those with which he had in
</p>
<p>former and better days spread desolation throughout the
</p>
<p>Indian country, and made his name a terror to the savage

<p>heart. It was large enough, had other conditions been
</p>
<p>favorable, to have accomplished the object sought. But
</p>
<p>'Among the prisoners taken were the wives of Mokintha, whom Mc-
</p>

</p>
<p>mutual confidence between the men and their chief no
</p>
<p>longer existed. After a hurried and tumultuous council,
</p>
<p>the order for the return was given; the two parts of the
</p>
<p>army uniting in the evening marched together back to
</p>
<p>Vincennes, which they reached on the 8th of October. It
</p>
<p>has pleased the undiscriminating eulogists of a gallant man
</p>
<p>to place the entire responsibility for this most mortifying
</p>
<p>of failures upon the officers of General Clark, who are
</p>
<p>alleged to have been his enemies and to have envied his
</p>
<p>fame. Those officers have been charged with sowing the
</p>
<p>seeds of dissatisfaction among the men, by falsely repre-
</p>
<p>senting Clark to have been unfit for command ; and con-
</p>
<p>temporary chroniclers relate as an instance of the alleged
</p>
<p>calumnies set afloat by those jealous officers the report
</p>
<p>which was current, that Clark had sent a flag of truce to
</p>
<p>an Indian town, offering them the choice of peace or war,
</p>
<p>and had thus destroyed the chance of a surprise, which
</p>
<p>was of such immense importance in savage warfare. But
</p>
<p>care has always been taken not to name those enemies, and
</p>
<p>not to state any causes they had for enmity.
</p>
<p>At this distance the unbiased reader will find it easier
</p>
<p>to believe, that the charges made by those officers were
</p>
<p>true, and that Clark was unfit to lead, than that three hun-
</p>
<p>dred Kentuckians, who had never before turned their
</p>
<p>backs upon a foe, availed themselves of lying pretexts to
</p>
<p>abandon a commander of such brilliant prestige, and to
</p>
<p>turn back from an expedition in which they had volun-
</p>
<p>tarily embarked. After all, the truth would be but a mel-
</p>
<p>ancholy repetition of the story which families all over the
</p>
<p>world lament to relate of kinsmen, whose brilliant promise
</p>
<p>and achievements in youth served to render the more
</p>
<p>gloomy the clouds and darkness in which the sun of their
</p>
<p>lives went down. That truth is, that the life of exposure
</p>
<p>to which Clark had been subjected had tempted him to

<p>resort to stimulants to sustain his strength and energy;
</p>
<p>that the inducements to this dangerous indulgence had
</p>
<p>increased during years of comparative idleness, which to
</p>
<p>80 vaulting and proud a spirit was well nigh insupport-
</p>
<p>able ; and that the pernicious habit had grown upon him
</p>
<p>70 The Spanish Conspiranj.
</p>
<p>until it had become his master. A slave to his own pas-
</p>
<p>sions and appetites, the power to control which he had
</p>
<p>lost, he had become unfitted to guide or command others.
</p>
<p>By frequent exhibitions of himself in an intoxicated con-
</p>
<p>dition and with clouded mind, in his camp and to his men,
</p>
<p>he had at once forfeited their confidence and their respect,
</p>
<p>and their unwillingness to trust themselves to his direction'
</p>
<p>and to march to battle under his orders, was as natural
</p>
<p>as it was inevitable.
</p>
<p>Upon returning to Vincennes a council of field oflicers
</p>
<p>sanctioned, so far as such a body could give sanction to
</p>
<p>such a measure, Clark's determination to maintain a gar-
</p>
<p>rison at Vincennes, which was in the heart of the territory
</p>
<p>Virginia had years before ceded to the United States, and
</p>
<p>over which Virginia had neither control nor jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>If the strategic value of this movement as a measure for
</p>
<p>the protection of Kentucky against the Indians was open
</p>
<p>to question, there could be none that Virginia herself had
</p>
<p>no power to authorize it without the consent of the Con-
</p>
<p>gress, nor of the impropriety, to use no stronger phrase, of
</p>
<p>Clark's proceeding therein, as a sort of private enterprise,
</p>
<p>without the assent of Congress or the direction of his
</p>
<p>state. ^Nevertheless, measures were taken to recruit a gar-
</p>
<p>rison of 250 men under Colonel John Holder, and a com-
</p>
<p>pany of artillery to be commanded by Captain Valentine
</p>
<p>Thomas Dalton, and of this corps General Clark " assumed
</p>
<p>the supreme direction." If the organization of this force
</p>
<p>resembles the banding together of the " free companies,"
</p>
<p>which terrorized Europe in the middle ages, those placed
</p>
<p>at its head had as little respect for private right as that
</p>
<p>exhibited by the most predatory of the Condottierri.
</p>
<p>Clark commenced at once to levy recruits, appoint officers,
</p>
<p>and impress provisions, without the pretense even of legal
</p>
<p>warrant, and without the shadow of any other authority

</p>
<p>private property for their sustenance. His once clear
</p>
<p>and vigorous mind had become inflamed by indul-
</p>
<p>gence and made desperate by the chagrin of failure. His
</p>
<p>rage found a vent upon the unoffending Spanish mer-
</p>
<p>chants who had established themselves as traders at Vin-
</p>
<p>cennes, Kaskaskia, and at other points in Hlinois. Un-
</p>
<p>der his orders their property was seized and confiscated ;
</p>
<p>not merely that which could be used for military purposes,
</p>
<p>but furs, tafty, honey, various descriptions of dry goods,
</p>
<p>etc., which were sold. Clark asserted that the proceeds of
</p>
<p>the sales were used to pay the men whom he recruited.
</p>
<p>But there was evidence which was generally believed at
</p>
<p>the time, and which there was only too much reason to be-
</p>
<p>lieve, that a large part was appropriated to private pur-
</p>
<p>poses. Boats coming from Vincennes to New Orleans
</p>
<p>were seized; one was robbed of property belonging to
</p>
<p>Spaniards to the amount of $10,000  in retaliation, as was
</p>
<p>alleged.* Universal complaint of the lawless depredations
</p>
<p>of Clark's men went up from the French residents at
</p>
<p>Yincennes and Kaskaskia. In their proclivities for plun-
</p>
<p>der they were a mere banditti, but little better than In-
</p>
<p>dans.f These robberies, for as such they were branded at
</p>
<p>the time and really were, occurred not only after Clark's
</p>
<p>expedition against the Wabash Indians had been defi-
</p>
<p>nitely abandoned, and they had agreed to attend a Grand
</p>
<p>Council at Vincennes, in the ensuing April, to make a
</p>
<p>treaty of peace and friendship, but also after the return of
</p>
<p>Logan from his successful expedition against the Shaw-
</p>
<p>anese, on the Mad river. From a purely military stand-
</p>
<p>point, it appears from Logan's letter to the governor, that
</p>
<p>he regarded the garrisoning of Vincennes as a " wise and
</p>
<p>prudent" measure. But he had refused Clark's request
</p>
<p>to convene a board of field officers to sanction the seizure
</p>
<p>of supplies to sustain a garrison outside the limits of the

<p>have been used as the base from which the attack,
</p>
<p>which Clark meditated, upon St. Louis and the Kat-
</p>
<p>chez was to have been made; and that these seizures of
</p>
<p>the property of Spanish subjects were intended to precip-
</p>
<p>itate a collision with that haughty power.*
</p>
<p>* Marshall (Vol. 1, page 109) intimates that Wilkinson was jealous of
</p>
<p>Clark, and rejoiced over his failure. " General Wilkinson," (says the
</p>
<p>historian) " who was at the Falls of the Ohio, wrote to a friend in Fay-
</p>
<p>ette ' that the sun of General Clark's military glory had set, never more
</p>
<p>to rise.' There was much meaning in this sentence, which those who
</p>
<p>had fathomed Wilkinson knew how to interpret." Without attributing
</p>
<p>to Wilkinson the secret ambition of supplanting Clark, this prediction
</p>
<p>might very naturally have been founded on what he knew of Clark's
</p>
<p>habits and of his loss of public confidence thereby. The subjoined is
</p>
<p>an extract from a letter written at the time by some one in Kentucky to
</p>
<p>a friend in Philadelphia. The extract was forwarded from Philadelphia
</p>
<p>to the Governor of Virginia, but at what time it was received by that
</p>
<p>functionary does not appear, nor is the name of the writer given. All
</p>
<p>the circumstances, however, point unerringly to Wilkinson as the au-
</p>
<p>thor. The following is a copy of the extract as it is given in the Virginia

<p>The suggestions of Mr. Jay in the fall of 1786, (referred
</p>
<p>to on a former page), that Congress would rescind its in-
</p>
<p>structions and permit him to propose to the Spanish a
</p>
<p>treaty for twenty-five years, during which time the United
</p>
<p>States would agree to forbear their right to the navigation
</p>
<p>of the Mississippi below their own boundaries, were made
</p>
<p>to Congress while that body was in secret session. JSTot-
</p>
<p>withstanding this fact, the proceedings thereon soon be-
</p>
<p>came partially known ; and by the artful and designing
</p>
<p>these suggestions of the Secretary for Foreign Affairs
</p>
<p>were easily magnified into an actual treaty to the same
</p>
<p>efl:'ect. That the seizure of the property of Spanish mer-
</p>
<p>chants by Clark was not simply a measure to obtain nec-
</p>
<p>essaries for his irregular troops, but was directly prompted
</p>
<p>by exaggerated rumors concerning Mr. Jay's suggestions
</p>
<p>to Congress, and was absolutely designed as a hostile move-
</p>
<p>ment against Spain, can scarcely be doubted.
</p>
<p>On the 4th of December, 1786, Thomas Green, then a
</p>
<p>citizen of Louisville, wrote to the Governor of Georgia,
</p>
<p>(which State claimed a western boundary extending to the
</p>
<p>Mississippi and embracing a part of the territory occupied
</p>
<p>and held by Spain above the 31st degree of latitude) 
</p>
<p>declaring the public sentiment to be that the treaty with
</p>
<p>Spain was " unjust, cruel and oppressive ;" that it would
</p>
<p>"subjugate" the western people to a "worse slavery"
</p>
<p>than any to which Great Britain had ever presumed to
</p>
<p>subject the people of any part of her dominions ; that the
</p>
<p>minds of the people of Kentucky were " very much exas-
</p>
<p>perated against both Spaniards and Congress;'' that the
</p>
<p>ers, and BuUett and Anderson will execute it. Clark is eternally drunk,
</p>
<p>and yet full of design. I told him he would be hanged. He laughed
</p>
<p>and said he could take refuge among the Indians. A stroke is medi-
</p>
<p>tated against St. Louis and the Natchez."

<p>to a member of Congress from that State. These statements might be

<p>disregarded, as not vouched for by responsible names, were they not
</p>
<p>unfortunately fully sustained by statements made under oath and re-

</p>
<p>Spanish property at Vincermes and in the Illinois had been
</p>
<p>seized by the troops pf Clark " in retaliation for the
</p>
<p>many offenses" of Spaniards; that General Clark, "to-
</p>
<p>gether with many other gentlemen of merit," had
</p>
<p>"engaged to raise troops sufficient" and to "go with
</p>
<p>me to the !N"atchez to take possession," provided the Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor of Georgia would give them countenance and the
</p>
<p>lands claimed by that State ; that General Clark and the
</p>
<p>others would be " ready to proceed down the river on the
</p>
<p>shortest notice," and were merely awaiting a favorable
</p>
<p>answer to set out; and for further particulars referred him
</p>
<p>to the bearer, William "Wells.* To a committee appointed
</p>
<p>at Danville (evidently by members of the convention who
</p>
<p>were there) to receive from him such information as he
</p>
<p>might choose to give, Clark afterwards admitted the seizure
</p>
<p>of the property of the Spanish traders, but alleged that it
</p>
<p>was for the sole purpose of subsisting the troops he had
</p>
<p>enlisted at Vincennes without authority ; asserted that he
</p>
<p>never saw the letter of Thomas Green, had no purpose to
</p>
<p>molest the Spaniards at Natchez ; and understood Green's
</p>
<p>object to be to establish a settlement at or near the mouth
</p>
<p>of the Yazoo, under the authority of the State of Georgia.
</p>
<p>The committee reported this as General Clark's statement,
</p>
<p>but, as no settlement could have been made at the mouth
</p>
<p>of the Yazoo at that time, under the authority of the State
</p>
<p>of Georgia, without certain hostilities with the Spanish,
</p>
<p>they evidently attached but little value to his assertion of
</p>
<p>pacific intent, which was contradicted by his every act.
</p>
<p>It was but natural for them to believe, and the unbiased
</p>
<p>reader will find it difficult not to believe with them, that
</p>
<p>General Clark knew the contents of Green's letter, when
</p>
<p>they had the evidence before them that he had given a
</p>
<p>written bond to contribute an equal amount with the
</p>
<p>writer thereof to pay Wells for his trouble in conveying

</p>
<p>About the same time that Green's letter was dispatclied
</p>
<p>to the Governor of Georgia copies of an inflammatory and
</p>
<p>incendiary production, apparently by the same author, was
</p>
<p>circulated with an air of secrecy among many of the set-

</p>
<p>surrectionary would-be State of Frankland  Tennessee 
</p>
<p>whence one of them was forwarded to the Governor ot
</p>
<p>Virginia. It branded the alleged treaty with Spain as a
</p>
<p>"grievance not to be borne;" that the acts which drove
</p>
<p>the colonies into the Revolution " were not so barefaced
</p>
<p>and intolerable;" that to subject their shipments down
</p>
<p>the river beyond our own territory to the Spanish laws
</p>
<p>was "an insult to our understanding;" that "twenty
</p>
<p>thousand troops could be raised west of the Allegheny and
</p>
<p>Apalachian mountains " to resist ; that " we have taken
</p>
<p>all the goods belonging to the Spanish merchants at Vin-
</p>
<p>cennes and the Illinois;" that "preparations are now
</p>
<p>making here (Louisville) to drive the Spaniards from their
</p>
<p>settlements at the mouth of the Mississippi; " that in case
</p>
<p>the hostile expedition against Louisiana " was not coun-
</p>
<p>tenanced," and those engaged therein " succored (if need
</p>
<p>be) by the United States," " our allegiance ivill be thrown off,
</p>
<p>and some other power applied to. Great Britain stands
</p>
<p>ready, with open arms, to receive and support us. They
</p>
<p>have already offered to open their resources for our sup-
</p>
<p>plies." * "While it is not probable that the sentiments of

<p>the writer or writers of those letters were generally shared

<p>or countenanced by the people in the west, it would be
</p>
<p>idle to deny that among them were many disappointed and
</p>
<p>turbulent adventurers, who were disaffected towards Vir-

<p>Sir  Whatever general impropriety there may be in a few private
</p>
<p>individuals addressing your Excellency, on subjects of public nature,

<p>we can not resist those impulses of duty and aflection which prompt us

<p>to lay before the Honorable Board at which you preside, a state of cer-
</p>
<p>tain unwarrantable transactions, which we are apprehensive may,
</p>
<p>without the reasonable interposition of the legislature, deeply affect
</p>
<p>the dignity, honor and interest of the Commonwealth.
</p>
<p>The testimonials which accompany this, will give your Excellency a
</p>
<p>general idea of the outrage which has been committed at Post St. Vin-
</p>
<p>cennes, of the illicit views of Mr. Green and his accomplices, and the
</p>
<p>negotiation, which has taken place, between General Clark and the
</p>
<p>Wabash Indians.
</p>
<p>We beg leave to add, that we have reason to believe, property has
</p>
<p>been plundered to a very considerable amount, and that it has been
</p>
<p>generally appropriated to private purposes.
</p>
<p>We are fearful that Green will find no difficulty in levying auxillia-
</p>
<p>ries in the titular State of Frankland, and the settlements on Cumber-
</p>
<p>land ; in the meantime, attempts are daily practiced to augment the ban-
</p>
<p>ditti at St. Vincennes, by delusive promises of lands, bounty and cloth-
</p>
<p>ing from the officers appointed by General Clark.
</p>
<p>We beg leave to suggest, to the serious consideration of your Excel-
</p>
<p>lency, the necessity of carrying into effect, the treaty pi'oposed in
</p>
<p>April ; for we fear, that the savages when assembled, if they are not
</p>
<p>amused by a treaty, or kept in awe by a military force at St. Vincennes,
</p>
<p>will form combinations among themselves, hostile to this country, and
</p>
<p>before they disperse, may turn their arms against our scattered settle-
</p>
<p>ments, in such force as to overwhelm them.
</p>
<p>To the superior wisdom and the paternal care of the heads of the
</p>
<p>Commonwealth, we take the liberty of submitting, the matters, herein as
</p>
<p>mentioned, in full confidence, that every necessary measure, will be
</p>
<p>immediately adopted, and have the honor to be with every sentiment

<p>the governor that, in case any treaty should be made with

<p>mediate and efficient measures " for dispossessing a body
</p>
<p>cendiary efforts on foot in the western country against the Spaniards."
</p>
<p>[Madison Papers, Vol. L., page 598.]
</p>
<p>*In the Madison Papers there is an interesting account of this inter-
</p>
<p>view between the Virginia delegation, at which, Mr. Madison states, " a
</p>
<p>free conversation" was had. The Delegates endeavored to impress the
</p>
<p>minister with the opinion that the " concerted occlusion " of the Mis-
</p>
<p>sissippi would produce in the western people an " unfriendly temper,"
</p>
<p>"both against Spain and the United States," Clark's conduct being cited
</p>
<p>as an illustration; and that this would probably have the efiecfof
</p>
<p>throwing them into the arms of Great Britain." Numerous arguments
</p>
<p>were urged upon the minister why it was against the interest of Spain,
</p>
<p>as well as of the United States, that the navigation of the Mississippi
</p>
<p>should be closed to the western people. In response, Gardoqui affirmed
</p>
<p>that "Spain would never accede to the claim of the United States to
</p>
<p>navigate that river," and urged that, "as a result" of what the Dele-
</p>
<p>gates had said, " Congress could enter into no treaty at all." " He inti-
</p>
<p>mated," says Mr. Madison, " with a jocular air, the possibility of the west-
</p>
<p>ern people becoming Spanish subjects ; and, with a serious one, that
</p>
<p>such an idea had been brought forward to the King of Spain by some
</p>
<p>person connected with the western country, but that his majesty's dignity
</p>
<p>and character could never countenance it." It will be observed that this was
</p>
<p>prior to the instructions given by the Spanish Court to Gardoqui, as the
</p>
<p>result of Wilkinson's intrigue with Miro, to do all in his power to promote
</p>
<p>the severance of the west from the Union ; and that, while apprising
</p>
<p>the Virginia Delegates that such an idea had been " brought forward to
</p>
<p>the King of Spain by some person connected with the western country,"
</p>
<p>the minister repudiated the thought as one dishonorable to his sov-
</p>
<p>ereign. Yet it is upon Mr. Madison's account of this interview, and
</p>
<p>upon his account of a conversation of a similar tenor between the min-
</p>
<p>ister and Mr. Bingham and himself, that Colonel John Mason Brown

<p>bases his assertion, that Gardoqui " had quite clearly broached a propo-
</p>
<p>sition that Kentucky should be abandoned to Spain ;" and that "both
</p>
<p>Madison and Monroe had conversations of similar import with Gar-
</p>
<p>doqui," to the conference between the Spanish minister and John
</p>
<p>Brown, in which Gardoqui, as stated by Colonel Brown, " suggested that
</p>
<p>the western country should secede from the Union and put itself under
</p>
<p>the sovereignty of Spain." [Frankfort Centennial Address, page 14.]
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown refers to the pages in the Madison Papers, which con-
</p>
<p>tain the accounts of those interviews, but, as is his custom when
</p>
<p>making erroneous statements, he is careful not to quote Mr. Madison's
</p>
<p>language, which does not justify Colonel Brown's version. [IMadison

<p>Cherokee country, killed seven of the Indians and wounded

</p>
<p>that two of the horses captured from them had been

<p>belonged to Hary Innes. [^Letters of Ben. Logan., Hary

</p>
<p>out the Indian country. Retaliations by the Indians of
</p>
<p>course followed. In fact a general outbreak, not only by
</p>
<p>the Cherokees, but by other warlike tribes of the south-
</p>
<p>ern Indians, was with the utmost difficulty prevented.
</p>
<p>About the same time other forays were made upon Ohio

<p>Vincenues. Certainly he had not up to that time publicly
</p>
<p>advocated, and it may well be doubted if he had even
</p>
<p>contemplated, the schemes which his response to Governor
</p>
<p>Randolph's communication shows that he meditated when
</p>
<p>that response was made. That response was in many
</p>
<p>ways remarkable, but in nothing more than as a revelation
</p>
<p>of the motives by which Mr. Innes, holding office under
</p>
<p>Virginia, was animated in the transactions of the near
</p>
<p>future. By pleading their vagueness, he evaded compli-
</p>
<p>ance with the directions of the governor.
</p>
<p>For the information of that functionary he enumerated
</p>
<p>the several minor raids to which he knew the governor's
</p>
<p>letter referred. The situation was summed up by the as-
</p>
<p>sertion that " The Indians have been very troublesome on
</p>
<p>our frontiers, and still continue to molest us." This was
</p>
<p>stated to prepare tbe way for and to justify this: "From
</p>
<p>which circumstance I am decidedly of opinion that
</p>
<p>this western country ivill, in a few years, Revolt from the
</p>
<p>Union, and endeavor to erect an Independent Government ; for
</p>
<p>under the present system, we can not exert our strength,
</p>
<p>neither does Congress seem disposed to protect us, for we
</p>
<p>are informed that those very troops which Congress di-
</p>
<p>rected the several states to raise for the defense of the

<p>western country are disbanded. I have just dropped this
</p>
<p>hint to your Excellency for reflection; if some step is not
</p>
<p>taken for protection, a little time will prove the truth

<p>* The following is the letter in full, as pubished in the Virginia State

<p>Papers, and as compared with the original for the writer, viz :
</p>
<p>Haky Innes to His Excellency, Edmund Randolph.
</p>
<p>Kentucky, July 21st.] Sir: Your Excellency's letter, of the 1st of
</p>
<p>May, was delivered to me on the 6th inst., and after reflecting on the
</p>
<p>contents, I feel myself constrained to ask of the Executive in what ca-
</p>
<p>pacity they view me, because, from the tone of your letter it would be
</p>
<p>construed that I was vested with some executive powers. Your letter
</p>
<p>directs me to institute the proper legal inquiries for indicating the in-
</p>
<p>fractions of the peace. How I am to proceed on that business from so
</p>
<p>vague a direction, I know not. In my official capacity I can not do it ;
</p>
<p>in a private capacity, it would render me odious. But from whom I am
</p>
<p>to inquire, or against whom your Excellency wishes a prosecution to be
</p>
<p>instituted, your Excellency's letter is silent.
</p>
<p>If j'our Excellency calls upon me in a private capacity, I shall be ever
</p>
<p>ready and willing to give you such information, as far as may come to
</p>
<p>my knowledge, of any matter in which the weal of the state may be in-
</p>
<p>terested, and shall now give you the information on the subject which
</p>
<p>your letter refers to, viz : Colonel John Logan's excursion in February
</p>
<p>last and some others.
</p>
<p>Indians had made their appearance upon our south-eastern fron-
</p>
<p>tiers at several different times in the fall and winter. Some of our
</p>
<p>hunters had been attacked, and early in February one of our citi-
</p>
<p>zens killed at his own house. This induced Colonel John Logan, the
</p>
<p>then commanding officer of Lincoln, to raise his corps to range on the
</p>
<p>waters of the Cumberland, and to rendezvous at or near the place where
</p>
<p>the person had been killed, which was on the branch of Green river.
</p>
<p>Within a few miles of the place of rendezvous Colonel Logan came
</p>
<p>upon the trail of the Indians, who, it was supposed, had committed the
</p>
<p>murder. He followed and overtook them, killed seven, and got posses-
</p>
<p>sion of the horses and skins they had along, among which was a val-
</p>
<p>uable mare of mine and horse belonging to a Mr. Blaine, of Lincoln,

<p>also a rifle gun, which was well known to belong to a person wdio was
</p>
<p>murdered in October in the wilderness, on his journey to this district.
</p>
<p>Judge from these facts of the innocence of the Cherokees.
</p>
<p>Since the excursion of Colonel Logan, one hath been made by some
</p>
<p>volunteers from Fayette and Bourbon, under the command of Colonel
</p>
<p>Robert Todd, to the Scioto, in consequence of an information received
</p>
<p>from the Shawanese of the hostile conduct of a small tribe, said to be
</p>
<p>Cherokees, who had settled on Paint creek. Upon this occasion three
</p>
<p>were killed and seven taken, who have since made their escape.
</p>
<p>Last fall an excursion was made to the Saline by some volunteers
</p>
<p>from Nelson, under Captain Hardin, who fell in with some Indians,
</p>
<p>three or four of whom he killed, and put the others to flight. Another

</p>
<p>time was the younger brother of Hary Innes,  the gallant
</p>
<p>soldier, the stainless patriot, the gifted orator, Colonel
</p>
<p>James Innes.
</p>
<p>Hary Innes, when he wrote this letter, was of mature
</p>
<p>years, and had had large experience in public affairs.
</p>
<p>Certainly such a letter was not written without the gravest
</p>
<p>consideration by its author. Assuredly he did not make
</p>
<p>the prediction that the country of which he was an influ-
</p>
<p>ential citizen would soon " Revolt from the Union," when
</p>
<p>neither he nor any of his acquaintances contemplated a
</p>
<p>step so important ! Beyond peradventure, the action so
</p>
<p>confidently predicted had been discussed in his presence
</p>
<p>and by his friends, and among them had so considerable a
</p>
<p>hath been made from Jefferson the last of May, under Major Oldham,
</p>
<p>upon the waters of the Wabash, but nothing was done. The Indians
</p>
<p>have been very troublesome on our frontiers, and still continue to mo-
</p>
<p>lest us, from which circumstance I am decidedly of opinion that this
</p>
<p>western country will, in a few years. Revolt from the Union and en-
</p>
<p>deavor to erect an Independent Government; for, under the present sys-
</p>
<p>tem, we can not exert our strength, neither does Congress seem dis-
</p>
<p>posed to protect us, for we are informed that those very troops which
</p>
<p>Congress directed the several states to raise for the defense of the west-
</p>
<p>ern country are disbanded. 1 have just dropped this hint to your Ex-
</p>
<p>cellency for matter of reflection ; if some step is not taken for protec-
</p>
<p>tion, a little time will prove the truth of the opinion. Before I close
</p>
<p>my letter, my duty to support the dignity of this district compels me to
</p>
<p>remonstrate against a late order of Council. I have been requested by
</p>
<p>the Attorney General for the Eastern District to carry into effect such
</p>
<p>measures as should appear to be necessary for punishing General Clark
</p>
<p>and others for their conduct at Vincennes last fall, and make report to

<p>following that they felt sure of success in the movement.
</p>
<p>The letter is not a mere friendly note of information and
</p>
<p>warning to the Governor. It is an argument for, and an
</p>
<p>attempted justification of, the predicted " Kevolt from the
</p>
<p>Union," which the writer hoped, not less than he believed,
</p>
<p>would soon be made as he announced, and which he, a
</p>
<p>law officer of Virginia, was prepared to advocate and
</p>
<p>maintain. He did not oppose, but favored it. The whole
</p>
<p>trend of his conduct during the ensuing months -was to no
</p>
<p>other end.
</p>
<p>That this was his deliberate purpose is made absolutely
</p>
<p>certain by a peculiar incident, to the nature of which the
</p>
<p>attention of the reader is now expressly called : x^ineteen
</p>
<p>years after this letter was written by Hary Innes  in
</p>
<p>1806  when he was Judge of the Federal District Court
</p>
<p>of Kentucky, he, together with General James Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son, Judge Sebastian and Honorable John Brown, were
</p>
<p>charged in editorials and communications in a newspaper
</p>
<p>called the Western World, with having been implicated in
</p>
<p>an intrigue with Spain to erect Kentucky into an Inde-
</p>
<p>pendent State, to then separate the State so erected from
</p>
<p>the Federal Union, and to form an alliance with Spain,
</p>
<p>for the ostensible purpose of obtaining the freedom of the
</p>
<p>navigation of the Mississippi. The charge was bitterly
</p>
<p>denied by Innes and his friends, and was denounced as a
</p>
<p>vile calumny, and as the emanation of personal malice,
</p>
<p>having no foundation in truth. It was alleged in his be-
</p>
<p>half, as well as in that of Wilkinson, Sebastian and Brown,
</p>
<p>that they were in favor of separating Kentucky from Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia, and of erecting the district into an independent state,
</p>
<p>but that the separation they urged Avas from Virginia only,
</p>
<p>and not from the Union, which, it was asserted, was never
</p>
<p>for a moment contemplated by any of them. The ablest of
</p>

<p>the solicitation of John Brown, and on the promise of a

<p>liberal compensation for his labor, Littell was induced, in

<p>and integrity of which they were as responsible as if their

<p>"A Narrative of Political Transactions in Kentucky, by

<p>Mr. John Brown and Colonel Thomas Todd, as far as he knows and

<p>believes. Mr. Brown he knows did pay him, and either Mr. Brown or

<p>Mr. Innes, he does not remember which, paid him some money in the

<p>name of or in behalf of Colonel Todd.' " The original deposition 'from

<p>what purported to have been a true nudfuithful copy of the
</p>
<p>letter written by Innes to Governor Randolph, which pre-
</p>
<p>tended copy was furnished to Littell by Judge Innes him-
</p>
<p>self, to be laid before the public. But the pamphlet shows
</p>
<p>upon its own face that from the copy placed before the peo-
</p>
<p>ple, the words, " Revolt from the Union," which were in
</p>
<p>the letter written to the Governor, were stricken out ; and
</p>
<p>that the sentence was changed to read thus : " From
</p>
<p>which circumstance I am decidedly of opinion that this
</p>
<p>western country will, in a few years, act for themselves,
</p>
<p>and erect an independent government," etc. And when
</p>
<p>Humphrey Marshall, the historian, who had only the
</p>
<p>version published by Littell, charged and demonstrated
</p>
<p>that, by the logic of the circumstances under which the
</p>
<p>words were used, they could only mean a government m-
</p>
<p>depemient of the Union, he was answered by Innes- and his
</p>
<p>friends that this construction originated in the malice of
</p>
<p>the accuser, and was slanderous and false ; that the words
</p>
<p>meant simply a state government independent of Virginia,
</p>
<p>but forming a part of the Union, a separation from which,
</p>
<p>they asserted, had never for an instant been considered by
</p>
<p>Innes. But the reader has the advantage of knowing
</p>
<p>what Innes actually did write to Governor Randolph, 
</p>
<p>which Humphrey Marshall did not know,  and from his
</p>
<p>own written words possesses indubitable proof that no in-
</p>
<p>justice was done to Innes by Humphrey Marshall's
</p>
<p>animadversions upon this letter. By suppressing these
</p>
<p>words in the manner shown, Innes manifested his own
</p>
<p>painful consciousness of their unerring import, as well as
</p>
<p>of the conclusions that would inevitably be reached by all
</p>
<p>who should ascertain that he had used them. The neces-
</p>
<p>sity w^liich drove Judge Innes to the deceit involved in
</p>
<p>this suppression of his own written words, and to the sub-
</p>
<p>stitution therefor of others, which he and his friends,

</p>
<p>by those he had really written, was most urgent. Colonel
</p>
<p>John Mason Brown, the self-constituted champion of

</p>

</p>
<p>State Papers, on whicli this letter, as it was written by Innes
</p>
<p>to Governor Randolph, is published, which shows that he
</p>
<p>had read the correct copy of that letter. He quoted from
</p>
<p>that letter the words which immediately follow the sup-
</p>
<p>pressed and altered passage, bat carefully suppressed the
</p>
<p>signiiicaut words by which the quoted passage was pre-
</p>
<p>ceded, and which Innes himself had suppressed in the pre-
</p>
<p>tended copy published by Littell. It is thus made appa-
</p>
<p>rent that Colonel Brown was aware of the discrepancy be-
</p>
<p>tween the letter as it was actually written by Innes and
</p>
<p>the false copy thereof published by Littell, and was con-
</p>
<p>scious that the line of defense which he had adopted for
</p>
<p>Innes, in 1890, prohibited the publication of what Innes
</p>
<p>himself had suppressed, in 1806.*

<p>tect the nature of the artifice practiced by Judge Innes and his motive

<p>therefor.

</p>
<p>Sir Your excellency's letter of the 1st of May, delivered to me on
</p>
<p>the 6th inst., and after reflecting on the contents I feel myself constrained
</p>
<p>to ask of the executive in what capacity they view me ? Because from
</p>
<p>the tenor of your letter it would be construed that I was vested with
</p>
<p>some executive powers ; your letter directs me to institute the proper
</p>
<p>legal inquiries for indicating the infractions of the peace.
</p>
<p>In my ofiicial capacity I can nob do it; in a private capacity it would
</p>
<p>render me odious. But of whom I am to inquire, or against whom your
</p>
<p>excellency wishes a prosecution to be instituted, your letter is silent.
</p>
<p>If your excellency calls upon me in a private capacity, I shall be ever
</p>
<p>ready and willing to give you such information as far as may come
</p>
<p>to my knowledge, of any matter in which the weal of the State may be

<p>interested; and shall now give you the information on the subject

<p>February last and some others. Indians had made their appearance
</p>
<p>upon our south-eastern frontiers at several different times in the fall
</p>
<p>and winter; some of our hunters had been attacked, and early in Feb-
</p>
<p>ruary one of our citizens killed at his own house ; this induced Colonel
</p>
<p>John Logan, the then commanding officer of Lincoln, to raise his corps
</p>
<p>to range on the waters of Cumberland, and to rendezvous at or near the
</p>
<p>place where the person had been killed, which was on the branch of
</p>
<p>Green river. Within a few miles of the place of rendezvous, Colonel
</p>
<p>Logan came upon the trail of the Indians, who it was supposed had
</p>
<p>committed the murder. He followed and overtook them, killed several

<p>90 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>The omission of those words, pregnant with meaning
</p>
<p>and containing the very kernel of the issue in contro-
</p>
<p>versy, and the rearrangement of the sentence by Innes,
</p>
<p>were not accidental, nor was the suppression without a
</p>
<p>distinct design which is too obvious to require to be stated.
</p>
<p>The undeniable fact which stands out, that Judge Innes,
</p>
<p>who was as amiable in his social relations as his official
</p>
<p>station was dignified, did this thing is too painful to be
</p>
<p>dwelt upon; the nature of the act is one upon which
</p>
<p>every reader will make his own comment ; nor does the
</p>
<p>writer care to inquire further into the motive for the de-
</p>
<p>liberate connivance at this suppression by the critical
</p>
<p>essayist, who has so wantonly resurrected these old con-
</p>
<p>troversies from the grave in which they had slumbered
</p>
<p>for more than half a centurv. The incident here related
</p>
<p>and got i:)Os.session of the skins and horses they had along, among
</p>
<p>which was a valuable mare of mine and a horse belonging to a Mr.
</p>
<p>Blain, of Lincoln ; also, a rifle guii which was well known to belong to
</p>
<p>a person who was murdered in the wilderness in October last on his
</p>
<p>journey to this district. Judge from these facts of the innocence of the
</p>
<p>Cherokees. Since the excursion by Colonel Logan, one hath been
</p>
<p>made by some volunteers from Fayette and Bourbon under the com-
</p>
<p>mand of Colonel Robert Todd, to the Scioto, in consequence of informa-
</p>
<p>tion received from the Shawnees of the hostile conduct of a small tribe
</p>
<p>said to be Cherokees, who had settled on Paint creek. Upon this occasion
</p>
<p>three were killed and seven taken, who have since made their escape.
</p>
<p>Last fall an excursion was made to the Saline by some volunteers from
</p>
<p>Nelson, under Captain Hardin, who fell in with some Indians, three or
</p>
<p>four of whom he killed, and the others put to flight.
</p>
<p>Another hath been made from Jefferson in June last under Major
</p>
<p>Oldham, upon the waters of the Wabash. Nothing was done. Indians
</p>
<p>have been very troublesome on our frontiers, and still continue to mo-
</p>
<p>lest us; from which circumstance I am decidedly of opinion that this
</p>
<p>western country will, in a few years, act for themselves and erect an in-

<p>we are informed that those very troops which Congress directed the

<p>Another incident immediately connected with what has

<p>heen stated in the foregoing, and ot lilve essential nature,
</p>
<p>will farther aid the reader in forming a just appreciation
</p>
<p>of the character of the defense made for these men, by
</p>
<p>themselves, and by their most recent and most hardy
</p>
<p>champion ; and will in a measure prepare him for the
</p>
<p>developments hereafter to be made in these pages.
</p>
<p>After stating the efforts made by Governor Henry in the
</p>
<p>spring of 1786 to secure immediate action by Congress
</p>
<p>for an offensive movement against the Indians, the Littell
</p>
<p>pamphlet, in Chapter HI, proceeds: "The obstinate in-
</p>
<p>attention of Congress to these representations induced the
</p>
<p>executive of Virginia to give some vyry general directions
</p>
<p>to the county lieutenants of the district. Under these in-
</p>
<p>structions two expeditions were carried on against the
</p>
<p>Indians north of the Ohio; one under the command ot
</p>
<p>General Clark against the Wabash tribes, the other by
</p>
<p>Colonel Benjamin Logan against the Shawanese."' A little
</p>
<p>further on in the same chapter, referring to the spring of
</p>
<p>1787, occurs this passage :
</p>
<p>" In the spring of this year, the Indians infested and seemed likely
</p>
<p>to overrun the whole country. Great depredations were committed in
</p>
<p>almost every quarter. Congress though repeatedly urged by the executive
</p>
<p>of Virginia, pertinaciously refused to aflbrd the people any protection,
</p>
<p>and without assigning any reason for the measure, disbanded the troops

</p>
<p>which had apparently been raised for that purpose. And the executive
</p>
<p>of Virginia now censured the officers who projected and conducted the
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 93
</p>
<p>two expeditions mentioned in the last (this) chapter as conducted by-
</p>
<p>General Clark and Colonel Logan, in consequence of orders received
</p>
<p>from the executive."
</p>
<p>The " ISTarrative," continuing to dwell upon the "dis-
</p>
<p>tressing situation " of the country, then recounts the con-
</p>
<p>duct of the Cherokees ; the raid of Colonel John Logan ;
</p>
<p>the complaint of the Indian agent (Colonel Joseph Mar-
</p>
<p>tin,) ; the instruction of the governor to Innes to "insti-
</p>
<p>tute the proper legal inquiries for indicating the infraction
</p>
<p>of the treaty" (a misquotation) ; and the reply of Innes.
</p>
<p>[t was plainly the intention to convey by these statements
</p>
<p>the idea, that General Clark and Benjamin Logan were
</p>
<p>censured by the executive of Virginia /or " projecting and
</p>
<p>conducting," and because they had so "projected and con-
</p>
<p>ducted," the two expeditions in question ; and such would
</p>
<p>indubitably be the impression received by any one who
</p>
<p>reads these statements and who is uninformed as to the
</p>
<p>real facts, with which all the parties who paid for the
</p>
<p>writing and printing of Littell's pamphlet were fully ac-
</p>
<p>quainted. These facts were then, and are now : That no
</p>
<p>censure was ever passed by the executive of Virginia*
</p>
<p>upon General Clark for having " projected and conducted"
</p>
<p>his expedition against the Wabash Indians ; that the
</p>
<p>charges brought against him for misconduct which occa-
</p>
<p>sioned the failure of that expedition were preferred by his
</p>
<p>own officers, but no censure was cast upon him by the
</p>
<p>executive on that account ; that the censure which the
</p>
<p>executive did pass upon General Clark related exclusively
</p>
<p>to his conduct at Vincennes, subsequent to the abandon-
</p>
<p>ment of the expedition, not so much for assuming to re-
</p>
<p>cruit men and commission officers without legal authority,
</p>
<p>but particularly for his seizure upon the property of Span-
</p>
<p>ish merchants there and in the Illinois, in violation of the
</p>
<p>laws of nations, and in derogation of the dignity of the

</p>
<p>cited this action as .a manifestation of the ill will of the
</p>
<p>governor to Kentucky and as one of the acts which, they
</p>
<p>alleged, drove her people to exasperation. That they
</p>
<p>might by this complaint against Virginia conciliate the
</p>
<p>favor of the numerous and influential relatives of Clark,
</p>
<p>tliese men did not scruple to conceal from them, as well as
</p>
<p>from the people to whose contidence and generous sympa-
</p>
<p>thy tliey appealed, that the censure passed upon him was
</p>
<p>produced by their own letter. That the imposture might
</p>
<p>succeed, and that the people might be persuaded that
</p>
<p>Clark was humiliated because lie had defended them
</p>
<p>against the Indians, Judge Innes, (one of whose omis-
</p>
<p>sions from his letter to Randolph, in the pretended copy
</p>
<p>thereof he published in Littell, has already been noted,)
</p>
<p>found it equally necessary to omit, and did omit, from the
</p>
<p>same alleged cop}'^ the passage in the original, in which he
</p>
<p>declined to obey the directions to prosecute Clark
</p>
<p>" for his conduct at Yincennes,"  the publication of
</p>
<p>which would have disclosed the true ground for the cen-
</p>
<p>sure, and thus have defeated the object of the statement.
</p>
<p>The dead Logan could not oppose to the assertion that he
</p>
<p>had been censured by the goveruor that scornful denial it
</p>
<p>would have met had he been alive. But as it aftected him,
</p>
<p>the statement was even more destitute of truth than it
</p>
<p>was as relating to Clark. That Judge Innes himself did
</p>
<p>not then construe the letter of the governor (of May 1,
</p>
<p>1787) concerning the " late hostilities committed on the
</p>
<p>Indians," to refer to the authorized expeditions in the pre-
</p>
<p>vious September and October, but only to the minor unau-
</p>
<p>thorized excursions which had recently been made by John
</p>
<p>Logan, Todd and others, is apparent from his own reply ;
</p>
<p>while the proclamation of the governor and the order of
</p>
<p>the council, disavowing the conduct of Clark at Vincennes,
</p>
<p>on their own face show that neither had application to

<p>Benjamin Logan, nor to his expedition, nor to any act in
</p>
<p>which he had participated or for which he was in any way
</p>
<p>responsible.
</p>
<p>Aside from the pamphlet issued by Innes and Brown,
</p>
<p>in 1806, and the work of Colonel John Mason Brown in
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 95
</p>
<p>1890, no book ever published contains an intimation upon
</p>
<p>which this injurious statement concerning Logan could
</p>
<p>have been based. There is not a suggestion of such a thing
</p>
<p>in the Virginia State Papers. A careful search among the
</p>
<p>archives at Richmond failed to discover a single line giv-
</p>
<p>ing it the shadow of countenance.* He was not included
</p>
<p>in the terms of, nor in any honest implication that can be
</p>
<p>drawn from, the censure visited upon Clark, nor was any
</p>
<p>reproach cast upon him by any governor throughout his
</p>
<p>long, useful and honorable military career. The state-
</p>
<p>ment in Littell was wholly an invention, the motive, for
</p>
<p>which is perceptible. The purpose of the "Narrative"
</p>
<p>was, by the most gross exaggerations, to make it appear
</p>
<p>that Congress and Virginia were distinctly hostile to Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky, and that this hostility was so flagitiously mani-
</p>
<p>fested as would have justified almost any act of which the
</p>
<p>people, in their alleged desperation, might have been
</p>
<p>guilty. As a flagrant illustration of this hostility, the
</p>
<p>j)retense was made that Clark was censured for projecting
</p>
<p>and conducting his expedition against the Wabash In-
</p>
<p>dians. But an incredulous reader might have asked, if this
</p>
<p>was the cause of the censure, why was it solely visited upon
</p>
<p>Clark who mai'ched to the Wabash and then marched
</p>
<p>back again, without meeting an Indian ; while Logan,
</p>
<p>who burned eight of the largest Shawnee towns, ravaged
</p>
<p>their corn-tields, killed hundreds of their cattle and more
</p>
<p>than a score of their w^arriors, was left unrebuked? The
</p>
<p>coupling of Logan with Clark, as having been included in
</p>
<p>and aggrieved by the censure pronounced upon the latter,
</p>
<p>was deemed necessary in anticipation of such inconvenient
</p>
<p>inquiries.
</p>
<p>Colonel John Mason Brown, however, was not beset by
</p>
<p>the temptations which harassed his grandfather and Innes
</p>
<p>when so hardly pressed by the Western World. He rested

</p>
<p>under no sore necessity other than that imposed upon him
</p>
<p>by the task which he had of his own accord assumed.
</p>
<p>Yet, in his ^'Political Beginnings" occurs this remarkable
</p>
<p>passage :
</p>
<p>Made by Colonel Raleigh Colston at my instance.
</p>
<p>96 The Spanwh Consjnracy.
</p>
<p>" Clark had been striving with desperate valor and tenacity of pur-
</p>
<p>pose to hold Vincennes and Illinois.* Lof^an had completely seconded
</p>
<p>him, hurrying back from the Wabasht to make an attack on the Mad
</p>
<p>river towns of the Shawnees. Their incredible toil, patriotic sacrifice
</p>
<p>of time and estate, and all their splendid services extorted nothing bet-
</p>
<p>ter than a chilling rebuke. No sooner had Patrick Henry entered the
</p>
<p>office of governor (in December, 1786) than the evil days began for
</p>
<p>George Rogers Clark and the policy he represented. The new governor
</p>
<p>of Virginia (Edmund Randolph) was quickly apprised by private let-
</p>
<p>terst from Kentucky, that, " General George R. Clark had undertaken,
</p>
<p>without authority, to raise recruits, nominate officers and impress pro-
</p>
<p>visions in the District of Kentucky for the defense of the Post of Vin-
</p>
<p>cennes, and had for that purpose also seized the property of Spanish
</p>
<p>subjects contrary to the law of nations.? Governor Randolph gave all
</p>
<p>the offense and irritation possible in proceeding upon this apparently
</p>
<p>anonymous information.^ He wrote to Hary Innes, Attorney General
</p>
<p>for the district of Kentucky, adverting in very general terms to the
</p>
<p>complaints that had reached him, and instructed him in vague lan-
</p>
<p>* Clark had as much valor and tenacity as any one, but it did not re-
</p>
<p>quire a great deal of either to hold Vincennes, which was not at that
</p>
<p>time threatened. And as for the Illinois, he had no men there at all
</p>
<p>except the squads he sent to seize upon the property of unofiending
</p>
<p>Spanish traders, whom they effectually cleaned out of all they had that
</p>
<p>was valuable. (See Harmer's letters in the St. Clair Papers.)
</p>
<p>tThe proceedings of the council of field officers held at the camp
</p>
<p>near Clarksville, on the 13th of September, 1786, show that Logan then
</p>
<p>and there left Clark to return to Kentucky to prepare for his expedition
</p>
<p>against the Shawnees. Logan was not nearer than Clarksville to the
</p>

<p>? Here Colonel Brown referred to a note at the bottom of page 322,
</p>
<p>Vol. 4, Virginia Calendar State Papers. This note relates to the letters
</p>
<p>noted just above, but does not either fully or accurately state their con-
</p>
<p>tents, and gives the name of Thomas Marshall only as the author.
</p>
<p>Exactly why the names of the others were not given, or why that of Col-
</p>
<p>onel Marshall was selected, out of the sixteen, to be given as the
</p>
<p>author, is not by me fully understood, unless it may have been that his
</p>
<p>was the first name signed to the paper. The note in the State Papers is
</p>
<p>misleading.
</p>
<p>*[\ What Colonel Brown styles " this apparently anonymous information "
</p>
<p>was the letter signed by his own grandfather, by Hary Innes, Caleb

<p>guage " to institute the proper legal inquiries for indicating the infrac-
</p>
<p>tions of the peace."* The answer of Innes was characteristically
</p>
<p>frank. He showed how there was not enough of distinct direction in
</p>
<p>the governor's letter to warrant any official procedure. But he im-
</p>
<p>proved the occasion to warn the governor that such persistent neglect
</p>
<p>(both Federal and on the part of Virginia,) to protect the Kentucky
</p>
<p>frontiers, coupled with complaintst against the men, who, being thus
</p>
<p>neglected, protected themselves, and followed by official prosecutions of
</p>
<p>leaders like Clark and LoganJ [Benjamin] would almost certainly drive
</p>
<p>the people to desperation, and, he added, for the executive's informa-
</p>
<p>tion : "I have just dropped the hint to your excellency for matter of
</p>
<p>reflection; if some step is not taken for protection a little time will
</p>
<p>prove the truth of the opinion."  Clark wisely refused to be provoked
</p>
<p>by the instructions that came from the Attorney General of Virginia
</p>
<p>directing Innes to institute a criminal prosecution. Logan quietly re-
</p>
<p>tired to his fai-m "
</p>
<p>Benjamin Logan died in 1802, in blissful ignorance that
</p>
<p>he had ever been subjected to the "chilling rebuke" from
</p>
<p>Governor Randolph, which Colonel Brown, following in the
</p>
<p>footsteps of his grandfather and Innes, incorrectly states
</p>
<p>that the hero received.^ It is true that Logan " quietly
</p>
<p>retired to his farm after a successful campaign," but only
</p>
<p>as it was equally true of all other militia oificers of that
</p>
<p>day, when they were not engaged in active service. But
</p>
<p>that he did this in consequence of any " chilling rebuke "
</p>
<p>which, had been administered to him, as Colonel Brown
</p>
<p>intended to have it believed, is wholly untrue. He re-
</p>
<p>mained quietly on his farm but a short time. The month

<p>the gallant Colonel, on a later page, imputes it to Colonel Marshall
</p>
<p>alone.
</p>
<p>* The letter of the governor, as already stated, related exclusively to
</p>
<p>the " late hostilities committed against the Indians," by Colonel John
</p>
<p>Logan, Todd, el. al., and had no reference to Clark.

<p>Orders were given that the arms and ammunition which

<p>the position of the first officer in command in Kentucky,

<p>and to honorably discharge its duties, until the change in

<p>the form of the Federal Government in 1789. By Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Randolph he was on several occasions called upon to
</p>
<p>perform important services, and was invariably addressed
</p>
<p>with courtesy, and there was manifested towards him that
</p>
<p>confidence which his high character was so well calculated
</p>
<p>to inspire. The records show that it was upon him his
</p>
<p>fellow citizens relied to pacif}^ the Cherokees. It was he
</p>
<p>who held the council at Limestone with the Shawnees,
</p>
<p>where he restored to them the wives and son of the aged
</p>
<p>Moluntha, whom the savage McGary had murdered; he
</p>
<p>had given them a refuge in |iis own home. His active in-

<p>fluence in all military affairs in the district continued to

<p>be in every direction exerted. f
</p>
<p>*'The General Assembly had previously taken action for the defense
</p>
<p>of the district, such as was satisfactory to the Kentucky representatives

<p>in that body. One of these representatives, Colonel Joseph Crockett, in
</p>
<p>a letter to the governor, bearing date November 27, 178G, gave this testi-
</p>
<p>mony : " Since he has had the honor of a seat in the legislature he had

<p>observed with pleasure that the Executive was doing all in their power
</p>
<p>for the welfare and safety of the western frontier." [State Papers, vol.

<p>ances. One of these, as it appears from liis letter to Governor Randolph,

<p>Tlie letter of Hary Innes in reply to Governor Randolph

<p>governor had no application, and that Innes did not under-
</p>
<p>stand them to apply, to Benjamin Logan nor to his expedi-
</p>
<p>tion. Even if Colonel Brown never saw the proceedings of
</p>
<p>the council or the proclamation of the governor convey-
</p>
<p>ing the censure, he knew that it did not apply to General
</p>
<p>Logan or to any of his acts, and that no directions had
</p>
<p>ever been issued to Innes to institute proceedings against
</p>
<p>him. The letter which elicited the action of the council
</p>
<p>and governor against Clark, with the names of all its six-
</p>
<p>teen consj)icuous signers, was published in Billon's History
</p>
<p>of Indiana. The Western Annals made known that, albeit
</p>
<p>he afterwards evaded the direction to prosecute Clark,
</p>
<p>Judge Innes was one of those who gave the governor the
</p>
<p>information which induced that direction. Perrin's His-
</p>
<p>tory of Kentucky names Wilkinson as one of the signers
</p>
<p>of that letter, and mentions the number and respectability
</p>
<p>of the others. If Colonel Brown can be presumed to
</p>
<p>have been really ignorant, that what he describes as " ap-
</p>
<p>parently anonymous information," was a letter signed by
</p>
<p>his own grandfather and Innes, and by their friends Wal-
</p>
<p>lace and Wilkinson, and others, then his historical reading
</p>
<p>was neither so thorough nor so extensive as his admirers
</p>
<p>would persuade people to believe. If he was misled by
</p>
<p>the note in the State Payers, which he cited and from which
</p>
<p>he quoted; if he really supposed that the letter which was
</p>
<p>signed by his grandfather and fifteen others, proceeded
</p>
<p>from Thomas Marshall alone, he nevertheless certainly
</p>
<p>knew, that his statement that Randolph had proceeded
</p>
<p>"upon apparently anonymous information," was exactly
</p>
<p>the reverse of correct. Whatever his motive in this, it
</p>
<p>assuredly was not one of delicate consideration for the

<p>of the Virginia State Papers (Vol. IV) which names Thomas Marshall
</p>
<p>alone as the author of the letter in question, which was signed by

<p>this brilliant passage is so very fine that one involuntarily regrets that

<p>its historical value should be impaired by the irrejiressible facts, that the

<p>case, every one can easily comprehend his motive for sup-
</p>
<p>pressing the names of those who wrote the letter, and de-
</p>
<p>scribing it as ^'apparently anonymous ;" which on any
</p>
<p>other hypothesis is wholly unaccountable. And if he was

<p>struck with admiration at the adroitness with which his

<p>grandfather and Innes concealed themselves, while repre-

<p>senting to a credulous people that Clark and Ben. Logan
</p>
<p>were censured for protecting them against the Indians ;

</p>
<p>means of the overtures subsequently made by Miro to Wilkinson, and by

<p>Gardoqui to John Brown, and by de Carondelet to Innes and Sebastian.

<p>After admiring this eloquent passage in the " Political Beginnings," the

<p>reader will not be surprised to find that Col. Brown, warming with his

<p>subject, and referring to the Vincennes episode, stated, on page 123 of that

<p>a Spanish fort, or as though the beaver skins of which Clark despoiled

</p>
<p>It has been stated that so many of the delegates chosen
</p>
<p>to the convention of September, 1786, were engaged in
</p>
<p>the expeditions of Chirk and Logan, that the few who
</p>
<p>assembled in Danville at the appointed time, finding them-
</p>
<p>selves without a quorum, in order to keep the bodj^ legally
</p>
<p>alive met and adjourned from day to day until a sufiicient
</p>
<p>number were present for the transaction of business ; and
</p>
<p>that this did not occur until January, 1787. In the mean-
</p>
<p>time, the reasons why the terms of separation fixed in the
</p>
<p>act of the Assembly could not possibly be complied with,
</p>
<p>on account of the absence of the members, with a respect-
</p>
<p>ful request that those terms should be modified to meet
</p>
<p>the situation, were embodied in a memorial, which was
</p>
<p>forwarded to John Marshall, for presentation to the Assem-
</p>
<p>bly, of which he was a member.* This was done by Mr.
</p>
<p>^Members had heen elected to the House at the same time that dele-

</p>
<p>James Henderson and George Jackson, from other counties. The names

</p>
<p>Instead, the Assembly, on the 10th of January, 1787,
</p>
<p>enacted that members of another convention* should be
</p>
<p>elected in the ensuing August, to meet in Danville, on the
</p>
<p>third Monday in September, to whom should be submitted
</p>
<p>the question of separation ; in case of affirmative action,
</p>
<p>the authority of Virginia was to cease not later than the
</p>
<p>first day of January, 1789; provided that, prior to the
</p>
<p>fourth day of July, 1788, Congress should assent to the
</p>
<p>erection of the State and provide for her admission into
</p>
<p>the Union. This delay was predicated upon the fact that,
</p>
<p>so much valuable time having been lost by the absence of
</p>
<p>the members of the convention, there was not sufficient
</p>
<p>remaining for the convention, and the people f of the

<p>fixed by the original act of separation, in time to enable

<p>tThe following extract from a letter of John Marshall to his father,

</p>
<p>the sound reasons for the delay, which were generally accepted as con-
</p>
<p>clusive by tlie convention, to which the contents of the letter were
</p>
<p>made known, viz.:
</p>
<p>" The act is not precisely such as I wished it to be, nor is it conform-
</p>
<p>able to the resolutions of the committee before whom I appeared, but
</p>
<p>it may, perliaps, be formed on cautious principles ; on principles more

<p>to the peace and harmony of the district than had my wishes (^ which
</p>
<p>were to enable the present convention to decide the question finally)
</p>
<p>prevailed. Those, sir, who introduced and passed the law, reasoned
</p>
<p>that the power delegated to the convention by the people, to decide
</p>
<p>upon a separation, was limited in point of time to a decision to be
</p>
<p>made in such time that Congress might consider and determine on the
</p>

<p>sition to submit with temper to the decision of the majority, and the

<p>measures of the convention in consequence of a defect in the original

<p>and accommodating plan is to pass a law in which the defects of the

<p>Congress to assent and provide for the admission ot the
</p>
<p>new State prior to the first day of June, 1787, as stipulated
</p>
<p>in the original act of separation passed by the assembly.
</p>
<p>In evidence of the good will which inspired this legisla-

<p>tion, the assembly reiterated its sincere purpose that the
</p>
<p>district should become a State under the original condi-
</p>
<p>tions " whenever the good people thereof so determine and
</p>
<p>the United States in Congress shall thereof apjjvove." Con-
</p>
<p>vinced of the justice of the reasoning on which this delay
</p>
<p>was based, John Marshall yielded to the new act a reluct-
</p>
<p>ant assent, and in a letter which was immediately for-
</p>
<p>warded to Kentucky, stated the argument which made its
</p>
<p>wisdom apparent.* [Littell.]
</p>
<p>Late in January, 1787, a quorum of members attended

<p>the convention, by whom it was immediately resolved,

<p>its other work, when information was received of the

<p>changes made in the law, which rendered nugatory all

<p>on the presumption that the letter to Colonel McDowell was written by

<p>some member of the assembly other than John Marshall, probably by

<p>one of the Kentucky members ; and that the letter of John Marshall,

<p>natural. It was inevitable that among them men were
</p>
<p>found who seized upon so favorable an occasion to throw
</p>
<p>odium upon the assembly for an act rendered necessary by
</p>
<p>occurrences which that body did not control; and who
</p>
<p>endeavored to arouse and inflame the people, not only
</p>
<p>against Virginia, but against the Union as well. Still, the
</p>
<p>convention adjourned without an outbreak more serious
</p>
<p>than ebullitions of passion on the part of some of the
</p>
<p>politicians ; by the great body of the people the situation
</p>
<p>was accepted with becoming moderation. Their conduct
</p>
<p>under all environments and incitements was a splendid
</p>
<p>illustration of the law-abiding spirit, the patient endur-
</p>
<p>ance of grievances for which a peaceful remedy may be
</p>
<p>had, the steady courage amidst difficulties, and the persist-
</p>
<p>ent purpose under all discouragements, which, with the
</p>
<p>unfaltering faith taught by the Calvinistic philosophy, are
</p>
<p>the distinguishing characteristics of the Scotch-Irish race,
</p>
<p>which was then so largely dominant in the public affairs of
</p>
<p>the district. But now another a^jpeal to passion was made,
</p>
<p>another and a greater temptation was ofiered, only to be
</p>
<p>resisted and overcome.

<p>the 3d of September, 1786, when summoned before that

<p>then made, that it would be expedient to rescind the in-

</p>
<p>terested in lands in Kentucky, addressed to the assembly
</p>
<p>a memorial remonstrating against the proposition. It will
</p>
<p>scarcely be denied that they had the interest of the west
</p>
<p>as much at heart as any of the inhabitants thereof. Yet
</p>
<p>they resorted to no inflammatory appeals to passion, nor
</p>
<p>called a convention, but made known their grievance and
</p>
<p>stated their wishes to the legislature of their state, as the
</p>
<p>constitutional organ through which an appeal should be
</p>
<p>made to Congress. The house of delegates, accordingly,
</p>
<p>passed on the 29th of jS'ovember, and the Senate on the
</p>
<p>7th of December, 1786, resolutions, the first of which
</p>
<p>states that the action was based upon the remonstrance of
</p>
<p>"sundry inhabitants of the western country."* These
</p>
<p>resolutions, which were of the most decisive character,
</p>
<p>condemned the proposition in the strongest terms, and in-
</p>
<p>structed the Virginia delegates in Congress never to accede
</p>
<p>to " Jay's project." That the exaggerated reports repre-
</p>
<p>senting that Congress had actually concluded a treaty
</p>
<p>with Spain ceding to that power the navigation of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi for thirty years, were prevalent throughout
</p>
<p>Kentucky and the west in the fall and early winter of
</p>
<p>1786, is proved by the inflammatory circular, dated De-
</p>
<p>cember 4, 1786, which was distributed and as well as by
</p>
<p>the letter of Thomas Green to the governor of Georgia ;
</p>
<p>and that those reports were known to John Brown, Hary
</p>
<p>Innes, and George Muter at least as early as December
</p>
<p>22, 1786, is incontestibly established by their signatures to
</p>
<p>*The Journal of the Senate shows that the affirmative vote by which
</p>
<p>these resolutions were passed was of Senators Alexander St. Clair,
</p>
<p>William Hubbard, Matthew Anderson, Robert Rutherford, John Syme,
</p>
<p>Thomas Roane, John P. Duvall, Nicholas Cabell and Charles Lynch.

<p>voted in the negative were Colonel Burwell Bassett, Turner Southall,

<p>after the passage of that act (January 10, 1787), and yet

<p>known to its members. While it is probable that the

<p>great mass of the people were ignorant that Virginia had,

<p>The letter of John Marshall giving information of the
</p>
<p>emphatic and spirited action of Virginia, which was re-
</p>
<p>ceived during the sitting of the convention, was calculated,
</p>
<p>as it was intended, to soothe any irritation that might
</p>
<p>have been previously excited.f But, a few weeks after
</p>
<p>The resolutions of 1786, referred to, were as follows, viz.:
</p>
<p>1. " Resolved, unanimously, That a copy of the memorial of sundry in-
</p>
<p>habitants of the western country, be transmitted to the delegates repre-
</p>
<p>senting this State in Congress.
</p>
<p>2. " Resolved, unanimously, That the common right of navigating the
</p>
<p>Mississippi, and of communicating with other nations through that
</p>
<p>channel, be considered as the bountiful gift of nature to the United
</p>
<p>States, as proprietors of the territories watered by said river and its
</p>
<p>eastern branches.
</p>
<p>3. "Resolved, unanimously. That the confederacy, having been
</p>
<p>formed on the broad basis of equal rights in every part thereof, and
</p>
<p>confided to the protection and guardianship of the whole ; a sacrifice of
</p>
<p>the rights of any one part, to the supposed, or real interest of another
</p>
<p>part, would be a flagrant violation of justice and a direct contravention
</p>
<p>of the end for which the federal government was instituted, and an
</p>
<p>alarming innovation on the system of the Union.

</p>
<p>ing this State in Congress, be instructed, in the most decided terms, to
</p>
<p>oppose any attempts that may be made in Congress, to barter or sur-
</p>
<p>render to any nation whatever, the right of the United States to the
</p>
<p>free and common use of the river Mississippi ; and to protest against the
</p>
<p>same as a dishonorable departure from that comprehensive and benev-
</p>
<p>olent policy which constitutes the vital principle of the confederation ;
</p>
<p>as provoking the just resentments and reproaches of our western breth-
</p>
<p>ren, whose essential rights and interests would be thereby sacrificed

</p>
<p>generous policy of his Catholic majesty will perceive to be no less due
</p>
<p>to the interests of his own subjects than to the just and friendly views of

<p>the United States.

<p>t The following is the extract from that letter published by Littell,

<p>" That John Jaj'^, the American secretary for foreign affairs, had made
</p>
<p>a proposition to De Gardoqui, the Spanish minister, to cede the naviga-
</p>
<p>tion of the Mississippi to Spain for twenty-five or thirty years ; in con-
</p>
<p>sideration of some commercial advantages, to be granted to the United
</p>
<p>States ; but such as the people of the western country could derive no
</p>
<p>profit from."
</p>
<p>A meeting was thereupon held in Danville, and the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing circular was addressed and distributed to the peo-
</p>
<p>ple, viz :
</p>
<p>"Circular Letter directed to the different Courts in the Western Country.
</p>
<p>Kentucky, Danville, March 29, 1787.
</p>
<p>" A respectable number of the inhabitants of the district, having met
</p>
<p>at tliis place, being greatly alarmed at the late proceedings of Congress,
</p>
<p>in proposing to cede to the Spanish court the navigation of the Missis-
</p>
<p>sippi river, for twenty-five or thirty years, have directed us to address

<p>the inhabitants on the western waters, and inform them of the measures

</p>
<p>the first Monday of May, to take up the consideration of this project of

<p>from the several districts on the western waters, in convention, should a

<p>shall be most conducive to our happiness. As we conceive that all the
</p>

<p>measure which tends to almost a total destruction of the western coun-

<p>try. This is a subject which requires no comment; the injustice of the
</p>
<p>measure is glaring ; and as the inhabitants of this district wish to unite
</p>
<p>their efforts to oppose the cession of the navigation of the Mississippi,
</p>
<p>with those of their brethren residing on the western waters, we hope to
</p>
<p>negociation so dishonorable and injurious to America, so destructive of
</p>
<p>the natural rights of the western world  is warmly opposed in this coun-

<p>try (Virginia), and for this purpose the most pointed instructions are given
</p>
<p>our delegates in Congress. I persuade myself that the negotiation will

</p>
<p>vince Congress that the inhabitants of the western country are united
</p>
<p>in the opposition and consider themselves entitled to all the privileges
</p>
<p>of freemen, and those blessings procured by the revolution, and will
</p>
<p>not tamely submit to an act of oppression which would tend to a de-
</p>
<p>privation of our just rights and privileges.

</p>
<p>The attention of the reader will at once be arrested by
</p>
<p>these facts : First, that the statement made in the circular
</p>
<p>that the proposition in question had been made by Congress
</p>
<p>to the Spanish minister was untrue, and was not even war-
</p>
<p>ranted by the information the authors had received from
</p>
<p>the Pennsylvania committees, by whom it was only alleged
</p>
<p>that the proposition had been made to the Spanish min-
</p>
<p>ister by John Jay, our secretary for foreign affairs. Second,
</p>
<p>that the circular withheld from the people the important
</p>
<p>information which its authors had from John Marshall's
</p>
<p>letter, even if they did not have it from the Kentucky
</p>
<p>representatives in the Assembly, that Virginia had already
</p>
<p>acted on the subject in a manner the most prompt, em-
</p>
<p>phatic and decided. [The want of mail facilities and of a
</p>
<p>public press, leaving the people in ignorance of public
</p>
<p>affairs, placed them much at the mercy of the designing
</p>
<p>and unscrupulous.] Third, that in addition to preparing
</p>
<p>a remonstrance against the proposed cession, appointing a
</p>
<p>committee of correspondence to communicate with that
</p>
<p>in Pennsylvania and with any other, and delegates to meet
</p>
<p>with delegates from other districts in the west in a con-
</p>
<p>vention; that, in addition to all this, the convention called
</p>
<p>by the circular was invited to "adopt such other measures

</p>
<p>as shall be most conducive to our happiness," which cer-
</p>
<p>tainly gave a very wide latitude to a self-constituted body,
</p>
<p>possessing no legal power whatever. "With this exception
</p>
<p>the verbiage of the circular was unobjectionable. But, if
</p>
<p>only legal methods were contemplated, and if the right of
</p>
<p>united remonstrance and protest only was expected to be
</p>
<p>resorted to, it is difficult to conceive what result the
</p>
<p>authors of this circular hoped that the meeting it called
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. Ill
</p>
<p>could accomplish by such means more eftective than that
</p>
<p>which would be attained by the authoritative resolutions
</p>
<p>of the Virginia Assembly, which had been passed four
</p>
<p>months before, and of which they already had full knowl-
</p>
<p>edge. The people at large, who had no opportunity of
</p>
<p>knowing the real facts, and who were imposed upon by
</p>
<p>this circular, were greatly disturbed, as its authors in-
</p>
<p>tended they should be, and acted as they were requested to
</p>
<p>do. Delegates to the convention were elected from all the
</p>
<p>counties, and met in Danville in May, when the facts as to
</p>
<p>the real action of Congress, which was not stated in the
</p>
<p>circular, and as to that of the Assembly, which the cir-
</p>
<p>cular had suppressed, were made known to all, and the
</p>
<p>exaggerations of the circular were corrected. After nu-
</p>
<p>merous propositions, calculated and designed to increase
</p>
<p>the fears and add to the excitement of the people had
</p>
<p>been offered by the authors of this circular, and by others,
</p>
<p>in the shape of remonstrances, and had been defeated, the
</p>
<p>convention, finding themselves completely anticipated by
</p>
<p>the action of the Assembly, and that there was nothing
</p>
<p>proper and legal to be done that was left for them to do,
</p>
<p>adjourned,* without action of any kind. It was in June
</p>
<p>after the issuing of this circular and after this meeting,
</p>
<p>that General Wilkinson made his first trading venture to
</p>
<p>ISTew Orleans ; and it was in July that Hary Innes, one of
</p>
<p>the signers thereof, wrote to Governor Randolph that, in
</p>
<p>his opinion, "this western country will, in a few years.
</p>
<p>Revolt from the Union," which opinion and the declaration
</p>
<p>thereof, if it be conceded that they should not be associated
</p>
<p>with the circular and with the movement which it sought
</p>
<p>to inaugurate throughout the whole of the western coun-
</p>
<p>try, assuredly does not render that circular and attempted
</p>
<p>movement the less significant.!

<p>It (lid not suit the purpose of John Brown and Hary
</p>
<p>Innes to make known to the people through the pamphlet
</p>
<p>they induced Littell to write in 1806, that they had re-
</p>
<p>ceived information of Jay's proposition at least as early as
</p>
<p>December, 1786; so that fact, as well as their participation
</p>
<p>in the letter to Randolph, was carefully omitted from the
</p>
<p>" Political Transactions." And a statement was made of
</p>
<p>the communication received from the Pennsylvania com-
</p>
<p>mittee in March, 1787, as if that was the first informa-
</p>
<p>tion which had been received in Kentucky of that propo-
</p>
<p>sition.

<p>In the Appendix to the Political Transactions the reso-

<p>lutions passed by the Virginia assembly in 1806 (by the

<p>house on the 29th of ISTovember and by the senate on the
</p>
<p>7th of December), were published, and the date of their
</p>
<p>passage was given as the 29th of Kovember, 1786. And
</p>
<p>in the course of the "I^arrative" it was stated that the
</p>
<p>convention called by the circular issued by Brown, Innes,
</p>
<p>Muter and Sebastian, and which met in Danville in May,
</p>
<p>1787, adjourned without action, '' because th^y learned that
</p>
<p>the legislature of Virginia had entered into several resolu-
</p>
<p>tions, on the subject, expressed in strong language, and
</p>
<p>had instructed her delegates in Congress to oppose the
</p>
<p>cession;"  as if that had been the ^rs^ information re-
</p>
<p>ceived of those resolutions;  which may have been true
</p>
<p>of some of the delegates, but was utterly untrue as to
</p>
<p>Innes, Brown, Muter and "Wilkinson, who had known of
</p>

<p>the result of the circular of Innes, Brown & Co., and of
</p>
<p>the meeting in Danville in May of that year ; and, in re-
</p>
<p>producing this second series, Littell gave the correct date
</p>
<p>of their passage  November 12, 1787.
</p>
<p>On the 81st page of his " Political Beginnings," Colonel
</p>
<p>John Mason Brown reproduces the resolutions which were
</p>
<p>passed by the house of delegates on the 12th of November,
</p>
<p>1787, crediting them to Littell, who gave that date as the
</p>
<p>time of their passage ; but, in publishing these resolutions,
</p>
<p>he represents them to have been the resolutions which
</p>
<p>were passed by the house of delegates on the 29th of No-
</p>
<p>vember, 1786, which resolutions were also published in
</p>
<p>Littell with their proper date. If this was not the most
</p>
<p>strange of all possible inadvertences, the only rational mo-
</p>
<p>tive that can be conjectured for the omission of the reso-
</p>
<p>lutions really passed in 1786, and the substitution therefor
</p>
<p>of those which were passed in 1787, may be found in the
</p>
<p>fact, that the first of the series of 1786, which speaJss of
</p>
<p>the remonstrance of " sundry inhabitants of the western
</p>
<p>country," shows at whose instance the action was taken,
</p>
<p>and disproves the claim which Colonel Brown makes on a
</p>
<p>subsequent page of his book, that the exclusive credit for
</p>
<p>obtaining this action was due to his grandfather. It has
</p>
<p>already been seen that his statement that the letter of
</p>
<p>John Marshall conveyed the first news of the Jay project
</p>
<p>Kentucky is untrue. * The purpose of John Marshall's
</p>
<p>allusion to the subject in the letter referred to was evi-
</p>
<p>dently not to give news of " Jay's project" to the people of
</p>
<p>Kentucky, for it assumes as a fact what he knew to be
</p>
<p>true, that they had had that news months before his letter
</p>
<p>was written ; but it was to give assurance of the warm
</p>
<p>opposition to the project which existed in the eastern part
</p>
<p>of Virginia, of the pointedness of the instructions to
</p>
<p>oppose it, which had been given to the Virginia delegates

</p>
<p>navigation for the west, instead of an abandonment
</p>
<p>thereof to Spain. Its natural tendency as well as its pur-
</p>
<p>pose was, not to create excitement and irritation, but to
</p>
<p>relieve fears that had been previously entertained.
</p>
<p>But, not satisfied with his erroneous statement that this
</p>
<p>letter gave ^' the first Jieios" of the project, Colonel Brown
</p>
<p>proceeded to ascribe the conduct of John Brown and
</p>
<p>Innes in issuing their circular to the alarm produced by
</p>
<p>that letter and the corroboration it received from other
</p>
<p>sources. On the 79th page, he says : " It (' the news thus
</p>
<p>sent to the west by John Marshall ') greatly alarmed all
</p>
<p>who appreciated the vital importance to Kentucky and
</p>
<p>the people of an unobstructed navigation of the Missis-
</p>
<p>sippi. A meeting of citizens at once convened, and in
</p>
<p>their behalf a circular-letter was put forth over the signa-
</p>
<p>tures of George Muter, Harry Innes, John Brown and Ben-
</p>
<p>jamin Sebastian. It bore date 29th March, 1787." As
</p>
<p>this letter of John Marshall was received before the ad-
</p>
<p>journment of the convention in January, several months
</p>
<p>after the " news of Jay's project " was prevalent all over
</p>
<p>Kentucky and Tennessee, and two months before the issu-
</p>
<p>ing of that circular, it is evident that the circular was not
</p>
<p>predicated upon nor caused by that letter, as Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown intimates, and that the excitement and apprehen-
</p>
<p>sion which Innes and Brown did all in their power to
</p>
<p>create and increase, was not occasioned by any " news sent
</p>
<p>to the west by John Marshall." Colonel Brown goes on
</p>
<p>to say : " The circular attracted immediate and earnest
</p>
<p>attention. A conference was held at Danville in May (as
</p>
<p>the circular-letter suggested), but happily Virginia had
</p>
<p>already taken action that emphatically voiced the senti-
</p>
<p>ments of the west." . . Colonel Brown then tells us
</p>
<p>that the resolutions passed by Virginia on the 29th of No-
</p>
<p>vember, 1786, which "were long delayed in reaching the

</p>
<p>western settlements," reassured the people of Kentucky.
</p>
<p>This is true, as it relates to many of the delegates in the
</p>
<p>May meeting and to the great body of the people. But
</p>
<p>the signers of that circular had no need of that reassur-
</p>
<p>ance. They knew that Virginia had " happily already
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 115
</p>
<p>taken action ; " knew of the authoritative instructions the
</p>
<p>assembly had given to Virginia's delegates in Congress; 
</p>
<p>knew it from the very letter which Colonel Brown (in his
</p>
<p>efforts to fasten upon John Marshall the responsibility for
</p>
<p>the bad disposition which gave birth to the circular) says
</p>
<p>gave them their ^^ first news " of the project ! Why then
</p>
<p>did they ever issue the circular ? If a legal remonstrance
</p>
<p>was all they meditated, did they expect one from a meet-
</p>
<p>ing of the people of a district of Virginia, a meeting
</p>
<p>which possessed no legal power, would be more potential
</p>
<p>than that which had already gone forward from the con-
</p>
<p>stitutional authority of the whole state ? The explanation
</p>
<p>given in Madison's letter to Jefferson, which has been
</p>
<p>quoted, affords the only rational solution.
</p>
<p>After having taken these strange liberties with the
</p>
<p>facts, Colonel Brown, warming with his subject, was en-
</p>
<p>couraged to take yet greater liberties with his readers.
</p>
<p>The denial in the quotations made from the " Political
</p>
<p>Beginnings," that John Brown, Innes & Co. knew of
</p>
<p>" Jay's project" until John Marshall's letter was received;
</p>
<p>and the further denial that they knew of the action hap-
</p>
<p>pily taken by Virginia until after they had issued their
</p>
<p>circular of March 29, 1787 ;* makes clear Colonel Brown's
</p>
<p>own consciousness of the unfavorable light in which the
</p>
<p>certainty that John Brown had knowledge of that action
</p>
<p>prior to the circular would place his grandfather. Still the
</p>
<p>temptation to claim for his own ancestor the exclusive
</p>
<p>credit of having been the principal factor in the defeat of
</p>
<p>* There are in Kentucky and scattered throughout the west a large
</p>
<p>number of the descendants of the men who then represented Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky in the Virginia Assembly. They are modest people, unassuming
</p>
<p>and not given to boast of their ancestry. Besides, they feel that there
</p>
<p>was nothing in the conduct of those who went before them which
</p>
<p>needs explanation or demands a vindication. For that reason, perhaps,

<p>they would be the last persons in the world to claim for their ancestors
</p>
<p>a credit which did not belong to them, and to which others were en-
</p>
<p>titled. To give them a chance the writer deems it proper to say, that
</p>
<p>the delegates from Kentucky who procured the passage of those resolu-
</p>
<p>tions were : Colonel John Campbell, Captain John Jouitt, James Hen-

<p>the " Jay project" was irresistible. So on the 121st page
</p>
<p>of the " Political Beginnings" he coolly assures the con-
</p>
<p>fiding public that " BroAvn, representing Kentucky as a
</p>
<p>Senator in the Virginia Assembly, procured from it the
</p>
<p>emphatic declaration of 26th (he meant the 29th of No-
</p>
<p>vember, 1786, already mentioned) ;" and he then quotes
</p>
<p>one of the resolutions passed by the House of Delegates
</p>
<p>on the \2th of November, 1787. His language was intended
</p>
<p>to convey the impression that John Brown luas in the
</p>
<p>Senate in ISTovember, 1786, when the resolutions of that
</p>
<p>date were passed, and that he had procured their passage.
</p>
<p>When it is necessary to magnify the importance of this
</p>
<p>very remarkable man, John Brown, his yet more remark-
</p>
<p>able grandson transports him from Danville, Kentucky,
</p>
<p>where he in fact was at the time,* to Richmond, Virginia ;
</p>
<p>fully acquaints him with all the details of " Jay's project"
</p>
<p>and represents him as procuring the passage by the Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia Assembly on the 29th of November, 1786, of the
</p>
<p>resolutions condemning that project, with which, in fact,
</p>
<p>he had nothing whatever to do.f When it is desired to
</p>
<p>have it appear that the agitation fomented by Brown and
</p>
<p>Innes and their friend Sebastian, in the spring of 1787, was
</p>
<p>the eftect of the letter of John Marshall, it is alleged that
</p>
<p>the ^'- first news" of the Jay project reached Kentucky in
</p>
<p>that letter, which was not received until the last of Janu-
</p>
<p>ary, 1787 ; although their signatures to the letter to Gov-
</p>
<p>ernor Randolph prove that Brown and Innes had received
</p>
<p>the news of that project in December, 1786, if not earlier.
</p>
<p>And to palliate the significant circular, it is pretended
</p>
<p> His signature to the letter to Governor liandoliih, December 22,
</p>
<p>1876, shows that he was then in Danville.
</p>
<p>t On -the 1st of November, 1786, the Sergeant-at-Arms of the Virginia

<p>of the session. Though he continued to be a member of the Senate,
</p>
<p>Mr. Brown did not take part in any of the deliberations of that body

<p>from the day he was excused from further attendance that session, in

</p>
<p>this, notwithstanding that that information, according to
</p>
<p>the extract printed by Colonel Brown himself (page 78),
</p>
<p>was conveyed in the very letter of John Marshall which
</p>
<p>he says brought to Kentucky the "iirst news of 'Jay's
</p>
<p>project,'" and which was received two months before that
</p>
<p>circular was issued. As a " Comedy of Errors" the " Po-
</p>
<p>litical Beginnings" is an admirable production.*
</p>
<p>" John Marshall was a member of the House of Delegates which
</p>
<p>passed the resolutions of that year. He and his father, Colonel Thomas
</p>
<p>Marshall, wei'e both members of the House of Delegates of 1787, which
</p>
<p>passed the second series. The latter were never introduced into the
</p>
<p>Senate. The record shows that .John Brown had no part in passing
</p>
<p>them. The following is a copy of that record from the original journal
</p>
<p>made for the writer by Colonel Raleigh Colston, viz :
</p>
<p>Monday, November 12, 1787.
</p>
<p>'The House then, according to the order of the day, resolved itself
</p>
<p>into a committee of the whole House on the State of the Common-
</p>
<p>wealth ; and, after some time spent therein, Mr. Speaker resumed the
</p>
<p>Chair, and Mr. Thruston reported that the Committee had, according to
</p>
<p>order, again had the state of the Commonwealth under their consider-
</p>
<p>ation, and had come to several resolutions thereupon, which he read in
</p>
<p>his place, and afterward delivered in at the clerk's table, when the
</p>
<p>same were again severally twice read, and on the question put there-

<p>gation of the western streams and rivers of this Commonwealth, and of
</p>
<p>the waters leading to the sea, do, of right, appertain to the citizens
</p>
<p>thereof, and ought to be considered as guaranteed to them by the laws

<p>of God and nature as well as compact.

<p>subversive of justice, good faith, and the great foundations of moral

<p>Relieved by the absence of Wilkinson, who had gone to
</p>
<p>E'ew Orleans, the people proceeded in August, 1787, with-
</p>
<p>out acrimonious discussion and without tumult, to elect
</p>
<p>delegates to the convention authorized by the new act of
</p>
<p>separation to meet in Danville in September of that year.
</p>
<p>The district had now been divided into seven counties,
</p>
<p>which chose the delegates in equal numbers  thirty-five
</p>
<p>in all. The list of the delegates is correctly given by Col-
</p>
<p>lins ; Colonel Samuel McDowell again presided, and Thomas
</p>
<p>Todd was secretary. The convention met on the 17th of
</p>
<p>September, the day iixed bylaw. It was again quickly
</p>
<p>and unanimously resolved to be " expedient for the good
</p>
<p>people of the district, that it should be separated from the
</p>
<p>rest of tlie state upon the terms and conditions prescribed
</p>
<p>by law." An address to Congress, couched in respectful
</p>
<p>language and requesting the admission into the Union of
</p>
<p>the new state to be erected, under the name of Kentucky,
</p>
<p>was adopted. The time when the authority of Virginia
</p>
<p>should end was fixed as the 31st of December, 1788. Pro-
</p>
<p>vision was made for the election of members to a con-
</p>
<p>vention authorized to frame a constitution for the new
</p>
<p>state. And the members of the Assembly from the dis-
</p>
<p>trict were requested to use their efibrts with that body to
</p>
<p>have an inliabitant of the district chosen as one of the
</p>
<p>Virginia delegation to Congress. The convention, having
</p>
<p>fully and satisfactorily discharged all the duties devolved
</p>
<p>on its members, then adjourned, after a brief session
</p>
<p>which had been as peaceable as the elections at which
</p>
<p>those members were chosen had been orderly. Wilkinson
</p>
<p>was in ISTew Orleans. John Brown was not a delegate.

</p>
<p>From his advent in Kentucky in 1784, as the active rep-
</p>
<p>resentative of a Philadelphia mercantile association, no
</p>
<p>man in the district exerted a more extended nor a more
</p>
<p>corrupting influence in its public affairs than General
</p>
<p>James Wilkinson. Slightly under the average height, his
</p>
<p>form was yet a model of symmetry and grace, and his
</p>
<p>manly and dignified carriage at once attracted the atten-
</p>
<p>tion of every observer. If his brilliantly handsome face
</p>
<p>won instant admiration, his gracious manners no less
</p>
<p>pleased and invited confidence. While fitted by native tal-
</p>
<p>ents to move in the most refined circles of American society,
</p>
<p>he yet possessed and exerted all the arts which secure the
</p>
<p>favor of the multitude and excite the enthusiastic admira-
</p>
<p>tion of the vulgar. His command of language enabled
</p>
<p>him with ease to give to his ideas a forceful expression,
</p>
<p>while his full and musical voice was pleasant to the auditor.
</p>
<p>With an ardent and mercurial temperament, the fire of
</p>
<p>which was easily communicated to others, his gesticu-
</p>
<p>lation was at once animated and studied. With these
</p>
<p>genuine qualities of an orator, he had all the tricks of a
</p>
<p>popular Reclaimer. As a writer he had precisely that

</p>
<p>with those to whom his literary effusions were addressed*
</p>
<p>Dealing largely in exaggeration, yet most skillful in sup-
</p>
<p>pressions and in muddying the waters, his defense of him-
</p>
<p>self before the court-martials which tried him in 1808 and
</p>
<p>afterwards, was more adroit, and not less ingenuous than
</p>
<p>that made for his friend and coadjutor in intrigue, John
</p>
<p>Brown, in the " Political Beginnings." With real capacity
</p>
<p>for military command and love for the "pomp and circum-
</p>
<p>stance of war," he was fertile in resources, invincible in
</p>
<p>energy, and courageous in battle. Constantly asserting
</p>
<p>the integrity of his own motives, and boasting of his own
</p>
<p>love of truth, as well as of glory, lie Avas not slow to
</p>
<p>resent, by an appeal to the duello, if need were, any im-
</p>
<p>peachment of his honor. And yet he was probably as
</p>
<p>utterly destitute of all real honor, as venal, as dishonest,
</p>
<p>and as faithless as any man that ever lived. His selfish-
</p>
<p>ness was supreme, and his self-indulgence boundless, while
</p>
<p>his knowledge of all that is mean and corrupt in mankind
</p>
<p>seemed intuitive. With an ambition that was at once 1
</p>
<p>vaulting and ever restless, and a vanity that was imnieas- 1
</p>
<p>urable, to gratify the one and to offer incense to the other, \
</p>
<p>he did not scruple to pander to the vices of his fellows,
</p>
<p>to excite their cupidity, and to tempt them to treason. An

<p>own defense, as it was also equally one of Wilkinson and Sebastain,
</p>
<p>says: "This memorial was much admii-ed by the liferary gentlemen
</p>
<p>present in the convention for its dignified sUjle, the copious and compre-
</p>
<p>hensive view which was taken of the subject, the elegance of the eam-

</p>
<p>of the Spaniard."

<p>122 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>The Maryland family from which James Wilkinson
</p>
<p>sprang was in every way respectable. To prepare him
</p>
<p>for the practice of medicine he was well educated. Pre-
</p>
<p>ferring the career of arms opened to the aspiring by the
</p>
<p>Revolution, he entered the American service before he
</p>
<p>had attained his majority, and by activity, address, and
</p>
<p>really valuable services rose to the position of clothier
</p>
<p>general, with the rank of a Brigadier. His name figured
</p>
<p>more conspicuously than pleasantly in the scandals which
</p>
<p>ruined Conway, and left a taint upon the fame of Horatio
</p>
<p>Gates. His patrimonial estate, which was never large,
</p>
<p>having been entirely dissipated before he came to Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky, his avowed object in removing to the west was
</p>
<p>here to regain what he had squandered in tha east. On
</p>
<p>arriving in Kentucky he immediately encouraged the
</p>
<p>production of tobacco, for which there could be no mar-
</p>
<p>ket except in Louisiana, or by the outlet of the Missis-
</p>
<p>sippi's mouth. A native of Maryland, he had none of
</p>
<p>that reverence and filial aftection for Virginia which so
</p>
<p>many of her sons in the wilderness cherished ; nor, as
</p>
<p>events demonstrated, was his love for the Union whose
</p>
<p>uniform he had worn strong enough to prevent his dis-
</p>
<p>honorable descent to the position of a stipendiary of
</p>
<p>Spain in an intrigue for its dismemberment. It has been
</p>
<p>seen that the rejection of the temperate address to the
</p>
<p>General Assembly, which had been adopted by its prede-
</p>
<p>cessor, by the convention of August, 1785, as well as the
</p>
<p>substitution therefor of one breathing a different spirit,
</p>
<p>and of which he was the author, were induced by his in-
</p>
<p>fluence ; that the address to the people, of which he was
</p>
<p>also the author, which was adopted by the same conven-
</p>
<p>tion, was well calculated to excite and inflame ; and then,
</p>
<p>when the Assembly, instead of simply declaring and rec-
</p>
<p>ognizing the independence and sovereignty of Kentucky,

<p>as his address had rather demanded than requested, made
</p>
<p>the separation of the district from Virginia and its erec-
</p>
<p>tion into a state to depend upon the previous assent of
</p>
<p>Congress and its reception into the Union, he vehemently
</p>
<p>urged an immediate assumption of that independence and
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 123
</p>
<p>sovereignty contrary to the law. When, in January, 1787,
</p>
<p>the Assembly postponed the time of the separation, be-
</p>
<p>cause the time remaining was not sufficient for the action
</p>
<p>deemed necessary for obtaining the expression of the will
</p>
<p>of the people, and the subsequent consent of Congress, and
</p>
<p>the admission of the new state into the Union, by June 1,
</p>
<p>1787, he was the most open and violent in his expressions
</p>
<p>of chagrin, in his denunciations of the Assembly, and in
</p>
<p>his expressions of contempt for Congress.
</p>
<p>Having previously gathered all the tobacco, flour and
</p>
<p>bacon, he could buy with his own slender means,* or with
</p>
<p>borrowed money, or on credit, and having shipped them
</p>
<p>on flat-boats to I^ew Orleans, in June, 1787, he soon fol-
</p>
<p>lowed his cargoes. His own letter to Gardoqui, written
</p>
<p>some months later,t is witness that " having nothing to
</p>
<p>hope from the Union" he had, before starting upon this
</p>
<p>expedition, deliberately determined to seek the ''patron-
</p>
<p>age " of Spain as a means of relieving his impecuniosity,
</p>
<p>of proposing the schemes which were agreed upon with
</p>
<p>Miro; and, if they were rejected by the Spaniard, of then
</p>
<p>" opening a negotiation with Great Britain, which had
</p>
<p>already been active in the matter." Whether the agita-
</p>
<p>tions he had industriously fermented, and the revolution-
</p>
<p>ary measures he had audaciously advocated in Kentucky,
</p>
<p>were designed as the mere preliminaries to prepare an
</p>
<p>easy way for success in the schemes in which he immedi-
</p>
<p>ately engaged ; and whether the subject had been discussed
</p>
<p>between Innes and others and Wilkinson when the letter
</p>
<p>to Randolph predicting an early " Revolt from the Union,"
</p>
<p>was written, are less important inquiries than it is to as-
</p>
<p>certain what those schemes actually were in their incep-
</p>
<p>tion and progress.

</p>
<p>the Spanish Governor of Pensacola, hy Alexander Mc-
</p>
<p>Gillivray, a half-breed Indian, who united in himself the
</p>
<p>talents of a warrior, of a diplomat, and of a statesman.*
</p>
<p>Warned by the contemplated movement of Green and
</p>
<p>Clark the previous fall, Navarro, then the accomplished
</p>
<p>Intendant of Louisiana, on the 12th of February, 1787,
</p>
<p>wrote to his government that the enemies to be feared
</p>
<p>were not the English, but the Americans, who must be
</p>
<p>" opposed by active and sufficient measures ;" and to this
</p>
<p>end urged the encouragement of immigration to Louisiana,
</p>
<p>by the removal of restrictions upon her commerce, and the
</p>
<p>promotion of her industries. " The only way to check
</p>
<p>them," he wrote, " is with a proportionate .population, and
</p>
<p>it is not by imposing commercial restrictions that this pop-
</p>
<p>ulation is to be acquired, but by granting a prudent exten-
</p>
<p>sion and freedom of trade."! I^^ furtherance of the policy
</p>
<p>thus urged upon his court, Governor Miro, in the spring
</p>
<p>of 1787, had " somewhat relaxed in the restrictions upon
</p>
<p>the river trade, and had granted permission to a number
</p>
<p>of American families to settle in Louisiana. "J The regu-
</p>
<p>lations which restricted the commerce of Louisiana to a
</p>
<p>trade with Spain only would soon have depopulated the
</p>
<p>province ; and, therefore, infractions of those restrictions
</p>
<p>had been winked at by the colonial government, " and for
</p>
<p>some time a lucrative trade, had been carried on, not only
</p>
<p>on the Mississippi, but also, and principally, with the city
</p>
<p>of Philadelphia." But, suddenly, Gardoqui severely rep-
</p>
<p>rimanded Navarro, whom he " forced to proceed to the
</p>
<p>harshest measures," which occasioned great distress
</p>
<p>among the citizens of Louisiana. General Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>who had friends and correspondents, if not partners,
</p>
<p>among the Philadelphians in New Orleans, anticipated but
</p>
<p>trill i no- obstacles to the success of his venture. An inter-

<p>terview witli Governor Miro secured a speedy revocation
</p>
<p>of the order which had been issued to seize Wilkinson's
</p>
<p>cargoes, Wilkinson was permitted to sell his produce free
</p>
<p>of duty, and was hospitably entertained by the Spanish
</p>
<p>officials. These unusual attentions, and his growing inti-
</p>
<p>macy with the proud Spaniards, excited wondering com-
</p>
<p>ment. Besides the exemptions from seizure and duty then
</p>
<p>granted him, an arrangement for future shipments was
</p>
<p>made with Miro, not only of his own merchandise, but of
</p>
<p>that of his friends, which should be shipped in Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son's boats. This official permission he carried back to
</p>
<p>Kentucky ; it was renewed the following year and again
</p>
<p>in 1790. And to relieve his immediate necessities, Daniel
</p>
<p>Clark, Sr., was induced by the Intendant iSTavarro to
</p>
<p>advance the adventurer $3,000. ^
</p>
<p>During the administrations of Washington and Adams
</p>
<p>the conduct of Wilkinson excited the suspicions of
</p>
<p>those executives. At his solicitation, Daniel Clark, Junior,
</p>
<p> a nephew of Daniel Clark, Senior,  who at the time of
</p>
<p>Wilkinson's intercourse with Miro was employed in the
</p>
<p>secretary's office at Kew Orleans, and who, when his repre-
</p>
<p>sentations were made, was a Spanish subject, and, as such,
</p>
<p>was interested in concealing from the government of the
</p>
<p>United States the real character of that intercourse ;  this
</p>
<p>man w^as induced by Wilkinson to address a memorial to Sec-
</p>
<p>retary Pickering, representing that the privileges granted to
</p>
<p>Wilkinson were extorted from the fears of Miro, to whose
</p>
<p>apprehension of an invasion from Kentucky, it was alleged,
</p>
<p>he had successfully appealed. Afterwards, when Louis-
</p>
<p>iana had passed into the possession of the United States,
</p>
<p>and was represented in Congress by Clark, whose duties
</p>
<p>had changed with his altered allegiance and position ;

</p>
<p>army, maintained his corrupt relations with Spain, Daniel

<p>Clark presented to Congress a sworn statement, in which
</p>
<p>he alleged that those privileges were granted to Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son in consideration of his undertaking to separate Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky from the Union and bring her under the sovereignty
</p>
<p>or protection of Spain ; that Wilkinson became a pen-
</p>
<p>126 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>sioner of Spain, and continued to receive a pension from
</p>
<p>that power long after he had re-entered the army of the
</p>
<p>United States ; and he specified the times and pLaces at
</p>
<p>which Wilkinson had received various sums, the amount
</p>
<p>of which he named, in payment of that pension. Charges
</p>
<p>formulated in accordance with this statement were pre-
</p>
<p>ferred against Wilkinson, who was tried upon them by
</p>
<p>court-martial in 1808. He was successful in impeaching
</p>
<p>the testimony of Clark, by producing in rebuttal the
</p>
<p>apparently conflicting statements of the memorial which,
</p>
<p>at his importunity, Clark had addressed to Pickering a
</p>
<p>few years before. He impeached the evidence of Thomas
</p>
<p>Power, another important witness against him, by showing
</p>
<p>a similar discrepancy between it and a previous statement
</p>
<p>he had cajoled from Power. In his own behalf Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son did not scruple to insinuate that he had obtained the
</p>
<p>valuable privileges of trade by corrupting Miro and other
</p>
<p>Spanish officials. That his relations with the Spanish
</p>
<p>government, in the sale of tobacco directly to that gov-
</p>
<p>^ernment, had ceased before he re-entered the army ; and
</p>
<p>that the sums it was proved he had received while holding
</p>
<p>a commission from the United States, were balances due him
</p>
<p>on all old and legitimate commercial transactions. '' And
</p>
<p>Oliver Pollock, who was an intimate of Wilkinson, and,
</p>
<p>possibly, associated with him in his ventures ;  Oliver Pol-
</p>
<p>lock, whose relations with the Spaniards was known to have

<p>been so confidential that it was assumed he would cer-

</p>
<p>son, and yet from whom Miro carefully concealed his
</p>
<p>negotiations with that adventurer ; *  Oliver Pollock tes-
</p>
<p>tified in behalf of his friend, that he did not know of such
</p>
<p>a pension, and from his intimacy with the Spaniards he
</p>
<p>thought he would have known it had one been paid. On
</p>
<p>the contrary, he said, he had it from Miro himself, that

<p>tobacco in hopes to pacify the Kentuckians and people of
</p>
<p>the western country, to prevent a rupture between Spain

</p>
<p>and America, and in order to give time for negotiations
</p>
<p>between the two powers relative to the navigation of tlie
</p>
<p>Mississippi." Had this testimony been given in good
</p>
<p>faith, and had Miro been partly influenced by a wish to
</p>
<p>avoid hostilities from Kentucky, tlie fact would not have
</p>
<p>been at all inconsistent with his undoubted desire also to
</p>
<p>separate Kentucky from the Union, and that Wilkinson
</p>
<p>made a treasonable engagement to aid him in that enter-
</p>
<p>prise. The court-martial acquitted Wilkinson on the
</p>
<p>ground that, whatever might have been the relations be-
</p>
<p>tween Wilkinson and Spain before he re-entered the army,
</p>
<p>they had no jurisdiction to inquire into nor to punish him
</p>
<p>therefor. That his commercial relations had ceased before
</p>
<p>he went into the army. That, as he had made sales of
</p>
<p>tobacco to the Spanish government before he became an
</p>
<p>ofiicer of the United States, the natural presumption was,
</p>
<p>that the sums which had been paid him were in liquidation
</p>
<p>of debts due to him on account of his previous commer-
</p>
<p>cial transactions. And so he was acquitted. Clark and
</p>
<p>Power were both discredited by their own previous state-
</p>
<p>ments. It was impossible for them at that time to clear
</p>
<p>the waters which Wilkinson muddied by documentary
</p>
<p>evidence sufficient to convince a court which had been or-
</p>
<p>ganized in Wilkinson's favor. Yet his treason has been
</p>
<p>since established by his own letters so clearly that no one
</p>
<p>is so hardy as to deny it ; that he was for years a Spanish
</p>
<p>pensioner has been indisputably proved ; the entire scope
</p>
<p>and tenor of Clark's testimony against him, except as to
</p>
<p>the date when the pension commenced, have been abso-
</p>
<p>lutely confirmed ; and that he was correct even as to the
</p>
<p>date is abundantly supported by other facts.
</p>
<p>Wilkinson remained in ISTew Orleans during the months

<p>of July and August, 1787, and in September made his way

<p>home by waj^ of the gulf and ocean. While there he con-

<p>certed with Miro a memorial addressed to the latter, but
</p>
<p>really intended for the Court of Madrid, to whom it was
</p>
<p>immediately forwarded. Its exact terms have never been
</p>
<p>made public. They probably diifered in some expressions,
</p>
<p>if not in material respects, from the alleged copy, which
</p>
<p>128 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>was exhibited by Wilkinson on his return to Kentucky,
</p>
<p>which he read in the Danville Convention of November,
</p>
<p>1788, and the composition of which the " literary gentle-
</p>
<p>men " of that Convention thought so " elegant." The
</p>
<p>copy of the memorial which was read in the Convention
</p>
<p>was not handed in at the clerk's table for inspection by
</p>
<p>the members, but was retained by its author. It was not
</p>
<p>published at the time. The only report of it was made by
</p>
<p>Colonel Thomas Marshall, who had read it and who heard it
</p>
<p>read, and wrote an account of it to Genaral Washington. In
</p>
<p>his letter to Miro, February 12, 1789, Wilkinson assured him
</p>
<p>that " in order to elicit an unequivocal proof of the dis-
</p>
<p>positions of that assembly (the Convention) I submitted
</p>
<p>to its examination my original memorial and the joint
</p>
<p>answer of yourself and Navarro," and that he had re-
</p>
<p>ceived the unanimous thanks of that body in approbation
</p>
<p>of his conduct. On the 11th of April, Miro forwarded this
</p>
<p>letter of Wilkinson to Madrid, with his comments, in
</p>
<p>which he spoke of the boldness of Wilkinson's act in pre-
</p>
<p>senting this memorial to the Convention, and continued :
</p>
<p>" In so doing, he has so completely bound himself, that,
</p>
<p>should he not be able to obtain the separation of Kentucky
</p>
<p>fro7n the United States, it has become impossible for him to
</p>
<p>live in it, unless he has suppressed, which is possible, certain
</p>
<p>passages, which might injure him."* It sufficiently appears
</p>
<p>from this, that the memorial committed Wilkinson to the
</p>
<p>separation of Kentucky from tlie Union, and invoked the
</p>
<p>aid of Spain ; and to that length the copy read by him in
</p>
<p>the Convention undoubtedly went.
</p>
<p>The nature of Wilkinson's arrangement still further
</p>
<p>appears in the letter of Miro to Valdes, of January 8th,
</p>
<p>1788, already quoted, in which he says : " The delivering
</p>
<p>up of Kentucky into his majesty's hands, which is the
</p>
<p>main object to which Wilkinson has promised to devote himself

</p>
<p>Avould no longer have any inducement to emigrate, if they
</p>
<p>were put in possession of a free trade with us. This is the
</p>
<p>reason why this privilege should be granted only to a few
</p>
<p>individuals having influence among them, as is suggested in
</p>
<p>Wilkinson'' s memorial, because on their seeing the advan-
</p>
<p>tages-bestowed on those few, they might he easily persuaded
</p>
<p>to acquire the like by becoming Spanish subjects."'^ Every
</p>
<p>official report made by Miro to his government incontesti-
</p>
<p>bly demonstrates that his understanding of the arrange-
</p>
<p>ment made with Wilkinson was, that the latter would
</p>
<p>devote himself to the task of separating Kentucky from
</p>
<p>the Union.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the letters from Wilkinson to Miro
</p>
<p>furnish proof equally strong, that the understanding of
</p>
<p>the former in reference to the part he was to play did not
</p>
<p>differ from that of the Spaniard. Their minds had com-
</p>
<p>pletely met. By one of his boats which reached Xew
</p>
<p>Orleans in April, 1788, Wilkinson wrote Miro and
</p>
<p>Navarro of his safe arrival home, and that " all my predic-
</p>
<p>tions are verifying themselves, and not a measure is taken
</p>
<p>on both sides, of the ynountains which does not conspire to fa cor
</p>
<p>ours ;" which a man of a far less sanguine temperament
</p>
<p>might well have believed. On the 13th of May, 1788,
</p>
<p>Wilkinson wrote to Miro and Navarro a letter which fully
</p>
<p>discloses his construction of his bargain. From it this is
</p>
<p>an extract :
</p>
<p>" On the first day of January of the next year, 1789, by mutual con-
</p>
<p>sent, this district will cease to be subjected to the jurisdiction of Virginia..
</p>
<p>It has been stipulated, it is true, as a nesessary condition of our inde-
</p>
<p>pendenc'e, that this territory be acknowledged an independent State by
</p>
<p>Congress, and be admitted as such into the Federal Union. But a con-
</p>
<p>vention has already been called to form the constitution of this section
</p>
<p>of the country, and I am persuaded that no action on the part of Con-
</p>
<p>gress will ever induce this people to abandon the plan which they have

<p>previously come to an understanding with two or three individuals ca-
</p>
<p>pable of assisting me, I shall disclose so much of our great scheme as
</p>
<p>may appear opportune, according to circumstances, and I have no
</p>
<p>doubt but that it will meet with a favorable reception; because al-
</p>
<p>though I have been communicative with no more than two individuals,
</p>
<p>I have sounded many, and whenever it has seemed expedient to me to
</p>
<p>make known your answer to my memorial, it has caused the keenest
</p>
<p>satisfaction. Colonel Alexiinder Scott Bullitt and Hary Innes, our attor-
</p>
<p>ney-general, are the only individuals to whom I have entrusted our
</p>
<p>views, and in case of any mishap befalling me before tJieir accomplishment
</p>
<p>you may, in perfect security, address yourselves to these gentlemen, whose. polit-
</p>
<p>ical designs agree entirely with yours. Thus, as soon as the new govern-
</p>
<p>ment shall be organized and adopted by the people, they will proceed
</p>
<p>to elect a governor, the members of the legislative body, and other
</p>
<p>officers, and I doubt not but that they will name a political agent to treat of
</p>
<p>the affair in which we are engaged, and I think that all this will be done by
</p>
<p>the month of March next. In the meantime, I hope to receive your
</p>
<p>orders, which 1 will do my utmost to execute. I do not anticipate any
</p>
<p>obstacle from Congress, because, under the present federal compact, that body
</p>
<p>can neither dispose of men nor money, and the new government, should it
</p>
<p>establish itself, will have to encounter difficulties which will keep it
</p>
<p>weak for three or four years, before the expiration of which, I have good
</p>
<p>grounds to hope, that we shall have completed our negotiations, and
</p>
<p>shall have become too strong to be subjected by any force which may be sent
</p>
<p>against us." [Gayarre, pages 209-10.]
</p>
<p>On the 15th of June, 1788, Miro sent to Madrid a copy
</p>
<p>of Wilkinson's letter. From the observations with which
</p>
<p>he accompanied that letter, the following is an extract;
</p>
<p>the major referred to in which extract was Isaac Dunn,
</p>
<p>the confidential agent of Wilkinson, and who was in charge
</p>
<p>of his boats and their cargoes, viz.:
</p>
<p>" This major confirms all of Wilkinson's assertions, and gives it out as
</p>
<p>certain that, next year, after the meeting of the first assemblies in which
</p>
<p>Kentucky will act as an independent State, slie ivill separate entirely from

</p>
<p>the Federal Union; he further declares that he has come to this conclu-
</p>
<p>sion from conversations among the most distinguished citizens of that
</p>
<p>State ; that the direction of the rivers which run in front of their dwellings points
</p>
<p>clearly to the power to which they ought to ally tliemselves, but he declares that
</p>
<p>he is ignorant of the terms on which this alliance will be proposed."
</p>
<p>[Gayarre, page 212.]
</p>
<p>It seems also from a letter of McGillivray, the half-
</p>
<p>breed, to Miro, which the latter forwarded at the same
</p>
<p>time, and the statements in which are unfortunately
</p>
<p>fully confirmed by letters from John Sevier to Miro, that
</p>
<p>delegates from Tennessee had assured him that the peo-
</p>
<p>ple of that section, as well as those of Kentucky, were
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 131
</p>
<p>ready "to throw themselves into the arms of his majesty,"
</p>
<p>and were " determined to free themselves from their de-
</p>
<p>pendence on Congress, because that body can not protect
</p>
<p>either their persons or their property, or favor their com-
</p>
<p>merce, and they therefore believe that they owe no obedi-
</p>
<p>ence to a power which is incapable of benefiting them."
</p>
<p>The sentiment is closely akin to that of Hary Innes' letter
</p>
<p>to Randolph. Extracts might be multiplied almost in-
</p>
<p>definitely, to show not only the bargain of Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>but that a well defined purpose existed on the part of
</p>
<p>many to " Bevolt from the Union ;" but enough has been
</p>
<p>presented to satisfy the reader of the existence of that
</p>
<p>purpose. In the spring of 1788, Navarro left for Spain.
</p>
<p>In his last official dispatch he renewed his solemn warn-
</p>
<p>ings of the danger to the Spanish domination in Louis-
</p>
<p>iana and Mexico which proceeded from the restless am-
</p>
<p>bition and activity of their American neighbors. The
</p>
<p>remedy he suggested and urged, and the application of
</p>
<p>which he deemed not very difficult if the propitious cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances then existing were promptly utilized, was a
</p>
<p>separation of the west from the Union. The means by
</p>
<p>which this could be done were, by " granting every sort of
</p>
<p>commercial privileges to the masses in the western region,
</p>
<p>and showering pensions upon their leaders!'' The accom-
</p>
<p>plished Gayarre states, that this dispatch ' produced a
</p>
<p>deep impression at Madrid, and confirmed the government
</p>
<p>of Spain in the policy which it had begun to pursue.''
</p>
<p>Whether Wilkinson was bribed by the direct payment or
</p>
<p>promise of a pension in money from the inception of his
</p>
<p>engagement with Miro, or received his pecuniary compen-
</p>
<p>sation at first in the shape of exceptional trade privileges
</p>
<p>and in the price paid by the Spanish government for his
</p>
<p>tobacco, is a matter into which it is unimportant to in-
</p>
<p>quire. The relative degrees of turpitude in the two

</p>
<p>modes of corruption may well be left to casuists to deter-
</p>
<p>mine. His own letters indelibly stamp his scheme as
</p>
<p>treasonable and his motives as wholly selfish and mer-
</p>
<p>cenary.
</p>
<p>That Colonel John Mason Brown was fully conversant
</p>
<p>132 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>with all the details of the correspondence between Wilk-
</p>
<p>inson and the Spanish officials, as well as with the repre-
</p>
<p>sentations made by the latter to their court at Madrid, is
</p>
<p>made apparent by the note at the bottom of page 20 of
</p>
<p>his Frankfort Centennial Address, in which, after refer-
</p>
<p>ring to the " representations of the Spanish officials to
</p>
<p>their government," as given in Gayarre, he says : " That
</p>
<p>work [Gayarre) has been freely consulted and used in the
</p>
<p>preparation of this address." From his citations from
</p>
<p>these " representations," and from other parts of Gayarre,
</p>
<p>however, he carefully excluded every sentence concerning
</p>
<p>this scheme which had been concocted by Wilkinson with
</p>
<p>Navarro and Miro. On page 7 of that address, Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son's " grossly improper conduct, while holding the highest
</p>
<p>military command, and his receipt of money from the Spanish
</p>
<p>authorities," are admitted. But the fact that, befoi-e he
</p>
<p>had any military command, and contemporaneously with
</p>
<p>securing the trade permit, (his address in obtaining which
</p>
<p>is admiringly dwelt upon by Colonel Brown,) Wilkinson
</p>
<p>entered into a conspiracy with the Spaniards to separate
</p>
<p>Kentucky from the Union and to subject her to Spain,
</p>
<p>and that the two were evidently parts of the same nego-
</p>
<p>tiation, is scrupulously concealed from the readers of that
</p>
<p>eloquent oration. Immediately following a statement of
</p>
<p>Wilkinson's return to the army in the latter part of 1791,
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown, on page 14 of his address, says: " It is
</p>
<p>to be deplored that he did not, in forsaking civil life,
</p>
<p>abandon totally his commerce with the Spaniard ; for
</p>
<p>holding to the mercantile relations proper enough in his ciril
</p>
<p>days, he wrecked his name and fame and fortunes in a
</p>
<p>dishonorable intrigue. When the crime of a high mili-
</p>
<p>tary officer can be extenuated only on the plea that he lied,
</p>
<p>and that he deceived the foreigner whose gold he took,
</p>
<p>palliation is impossible." Again, on page 16 of the ad-

<p>dress. Colonel Brown says : " Wilkiiison's moral downfall
</p>
<p>was of a later date," [than his appointment to the army in
</p>
<p>1791], " his disgraceful attitude as a stipendiary of the
</p>
<p>Spanish king was not assumed until 1797, most probably."
</p>
<p>Disentangled from the ambiguity in which his meaning is
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 133
</p>
<p>ingeniously cloaked, the orator could only have intended
</p>
<p>to convey to his auditors the impression, that, prior to
</p>
<p>Wilkinson's return to the army in 1791, his relations with
</p>
<p>Miro were strictly commercial, were " proper enough,"
</p>
<p>and were innocent ; that the sole impropriety in his con-
</p>
<p>duct was in continuing, after he had become a soldier, the
</p>
<p>mercantile relations with Miro, which were innocent so
</p>
<p>long as he remained a civilian ! And while writing this.
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown had before his eyes the evidence in Wilk-
</p>
<p>inson's own letters, that the latter had, four years before
</p>
<p>he re-entered the army, made an engagement with Miro
</p>
<p>to devote his time to an effort to separate Kentucky from
</p>
<p>the Union, and that the mercantile privileges extended to
</p>
<p>him were granted in consideration of that pledge? The
</p>
<p>manifest injustice that would be done to Colonel Brown
</p>
<p>in one direction by assuming that he intended to say, that
</p>
<p>a scheme to dismember the Union, though dishonorable
</p>
<p>in an officer, was " proper enough" in a civilian, and as all
</p>
<p>intimations of the nature of Wilkinson's engagements at
</p>
<p>that time are excluded from the address, forces into prom-
</p>
<p>inence the disagreeable alternative, that he intended to
</p>
<p>deny in that address the facts of which he had distinct
</p>
<p>knowledge and irrefutable proof. But, in his ^'Political
</p>
<p>Beginnings'' (page 71) the same talented author admits
</p>
<p>that, in 1787, when Wilkinson obtained his trade permit,
</p>
<p>" he began with Miro an intrigue that fully committed
</p>
<p>him to Spain ;"  which is as true as it is that Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown knew it very well when, failing to state the fact to
</p>
<p>his auditors at Frankfort, he suavely informed them that
</p>
<p>Wilkinson's " moral downfall was of a later date " than
</p>
<p>1791. The reconciliation of the two statements with each
</p>
<p>other, and with that "historic veracity" of which Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown writes in the " Political Beginnings," is left to
</p>
<p>those whose talents are competent to the task.

</p>
<p>On his return from ISTew Orleans to Kentucky, Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son called at Mt. Vernon, on the 7th of December, 1787.
</p>
<p>Finding his former commander solicitous for the adoption
</p>
<p>of the " new plan," he informed Washington that North
</p>
<p>Carolina (through which he had passed) was "unanimous
</p>
<p>134 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>for the adopting"* the constitution; which was very,
</p>
<p>very far from true. In February, 1788, he reached Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky. The morning after his arrival at his home in
</p>
<p>Fayette he dispatched a messenger with a letter to Hary
</p>
<p>Innes, who then resided in Danville, and who, the next
</p>
<p>day, returned with the messenger to Wilkinson's home.
</p>
<p>Shortly after reaching Wilkinson's, Mr. Innes went
</p>
<p>with him into a room apart from the other guests,
</p>
<p>and there held a long and confidential consultation with
</p>
<p>[his host.f What the nature of the conversation between
</p>
<p>them, that could not be had in the hearing of Charles Scott
</p>
<p>and the other guests, was, may be inferred from Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son's statement in his letter to Miro (May 15, 1788), that
</p>
<p>while he had sounded many, yet " Colonel Alexander Scott
</p>
<p>Bullitt and Hary Innes, our attorney general, are the only
</p>
<p>individuals to whom I have intrusted pur views, and, in
</p>
<p>case of any mishap befalling me before their accomplish-
</p>
<p>ment, you may, in perfect security, address yourselves to
</p>
<p>these gentlemen, whose p)olitical designs agree entirely with
</p>
<p>yours^'X Certainly there was not one of his intimates to
</p>
<p>whom he would more naturally have communicated his
</p>
<p>engagements with Miro, than to the signer of the call
</p>
<p>for the Convention of May, 1787, who had, in July of that
</p>
<p>* Sparks, Vol. IX., page 288.
</p>
<p>t In the case of Innes v. Marshall, Eichard Thomas deposed that he
</p>
<p>had gone with Wilkinson on his trading expedition in 1787 as far as the
</p>
<p>Chickasaw Bluffs, and then returned to Kentucky with a letter from
</p>
<p>Wilkinson to his wife, and remained at Wilkinson's until the latter
</p>
<p>returned, in the Winter of 1788. " That on the evening of the day on
</p>
<p>which General Wilkinson returned he got the deponent to get ready to
</p>
<p>carry a letter for him next morning over the Kentucky river to Hary
</p>
<p>Innes, who then lived in the town of Danville, and furnished him with
</p>
<p>a horse and gave him a half sovereign as compensation and to bear
</p>
<p>expenses. This deponent further says that he went to Mr. Innes' with

<p>a letter to give him from General Wilkinson, which he delivered to said
</p>
<p>Innes. That Innes kept the deponent with him that night, and was
</p>
<p>busy writing a great part of the night, and next morning made an early
</p>
<p>start with the deponent back to General Wilkinson's, where he (Innes)
</p>
<p>was received by General Wilkinson, and shortly after they two went
</p>
<p>into a room together, leaving General Scott and several other gentlemen
</p>
<p>with the deponent drinking some spirits in the common room or hall."

<p>year, written to Gov. Randolph, that, " in a few years, this
</p>
<p>western countr}^ will Revolt from the Union," and who, in
</p>
<p>1806, struck those significant words out of what he vouched
</p>
<p>for as a true copy of what he had written. A short time after
</p>
<p>this conversation, ahout the 1st of March, 1788, Innes ap-
</p>
<p>plied to Joshua Barbee, of Danville, to know if he would
</p>
<p>descend the Mississippi for General Wilkinson ; and, Barbee
</p>
<p>consenting, he was employed, together with Richard
</p>
<p>Thomas, by Wilkinson, to carry dispatches to Miro, and
</p>
<p>to the commandant at ISTatchez, and a letter to Daniel
</p>
<p>Clarke. The dispatches were placed in a trnnk, which
</p>
<p>was weighted with rocks, with orders to sink the trunk in
</p>
<p>case there should be any danger of its contents falling into
</p>
<p>the hands of parties other than those to whom they were
</p>
<p>directed, and for Barbee to deliver these with his own
</p>
<p>hands.* Barbee and Thomas were kept in ignorance of
</p>
<p>the nature of the dispatches to Miro, and, in his suit
</p>
<p>against Humphrey Marshall an attempt was made by
</p>
<p>Innes to have it appear that it related simply to Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son's commercial ventures ; but it was really the letter in
</p>
<p>which Wilkinson gave Miro information that all things
</p>
<p>were conspiring to insure the success of their intrigues,
</p>
<p>and which was forwarded by J^avarro and Miro to Madrid
</p>
<p>in their dispatch of the 11th of April, 1788.
</p>
<p>On the 15th of May, Wilkinson again wrote, by Major
</p>
<p>Isaac Dunn, who was in command of the boats containing
</p>
<p>the second of his cargoes, stating his confident expectation
</p>
<p>that, though the law of Virginia consenting to the separa-
</p>
<p>tion stipulated, as a necessary condition of the independ-
</p>
<p>ence to be granted, that the district should first be ac-
</p>
<p>knowledged by Congress as independent, yet that no ac-
</p>
<p>tion Congress might take would ever induce the people to
</p>
<p>abandon the " plan," which he represented that they had
</p>

</p>
<p>will name a political agent with power to treat of the affair in
</p>
<p>which we are engaged.^' That the mercurial and sanguine
</p>
<p>Wilkinson actually anticipated, and had only too good
</p>
<p>reason to hope, that this result would he attained, all the
</p>
<p>evidence tends to establish ; and that he faithfully tried to
</p>
<p>accomplish it, and, so far as he dared, fulfilled his bargain
</p>
<p>with the Spaniard, is certain. His statement in a private
</p>
<p>letter to Miro, that " he, (Wilkinson) flattered himself
</p>
<p>with the prospect of his being the delegate of his state to
</p>
<p>present to me (Miro) the propositions offered by his country-
</p>
<p>men, and that he hopes to embrace me in April next,'' which
</p>
<p>was duly communicated to his court by Miro, was as
</p>
<p>honest a declaration as ever came from the lips or pen of
</p>
<p>the needy and unscrupulous adventurer.
</p>
<p>D' Arges, who had " received instructions from Gardoqui
</p>
<p>and the Count of Florida Blanca, one of the members of
</p>
<p>the cabinet of Madrid, to do all in his power to secure the
</p>
<p>dismemberment of the American Union," had gone to
</p>
<p>New Orleans to solicit aid from Miro, who prevented him
</p>
<p>from proceeding to Kentucky, in order that, as he ex-
</p>
<p>plained to his court, the vanity of Wilkinson might not
</p>
<p>be wounded by the discovery that a rival was engaged in
</p>
<p>the same enterprise, and might snatch from him the re-
</p>
<p>wards of success. In the meantime every facility was
</p>
<p>afibrded by Miro to Wilkinson, not only to ship his
</p>
<p>tobacco to ]!!Tew Orleans, but also for the purchase of
</p>
<p>merchandise there and its shipment on boats to Kentucky ;
</p>
<p>" because," as he explained to his court, " it is exceedingly
</p>
<p>important that the western people should see, before declaring
</p>
<p>themselves for a change of domination, that the true channel
</p>
<p>through which they have to be supplied with the objects
</p>
<p>of their wants, in exchange for their own productions, is
</p>
<p>the Mississippi." He wrote, as he stated to his govern-
</p>
<p>ment, to Wilkinson not to sell his goods for more than

</p>
<p>they cost him in New Orleans, " because it is highly im-
</p>
<p>portant that this first essay should inspire the inhabitants
</p>
<p>of Kentucky with the most flattering hopes. I have good
</p>
<p>reasons to expect that the arrival of the boats will produce
</p>
<p>the most agreeable sensation among those people, and will

</p>
<p>make them feel more keenly that their felicity depends on
</p>
<p>the concession of such commercial facilities by his majesty,
</p>
<p>and for the acquisition of which I conceive there are but
</p>
<p>few sacrifices which they would not make."*
</p>
<p>Wilkinson himself, in order to impress the people of the
</p>
<p>district with the advantages of a change of political rela-
</p>
<p>tions, not less than from a natural love of vainglory, as-
</p>
<p>sumed increased magnificence in his equipage and stylish
</p>
<p>living, dwelt profusely upon the advantage of navigating
</p>
<p>the Mississippi and of a commercial connection with
</p>
<p>Louisiana, with broad hints to the public, " that nothing
</p>
<p>was necessary to bring it about but separation from Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia and the independence of Kentucky." f The effect
</p>
<p>of this upon the minds of a people who had been carefully
</p>
<p>instructed that Jay had wanted to abandon the rights to
</p>
<p>navigate the river, that Congress would not procure this
</p>
<p>commerce for Kentucky ; but that now General Wilkinson
</p>
<p>had opened up the one and secured the other /or them : was
</p>
<p>to make Wilkinson the idol of the hour, and to direct
</p>
<p>popular clamor, prejudice and hate against the few who
</p>
<p>were bold enough to express their convictions, that, be-
</p>
<p>hind all these favors granted to Wilkinson, there must
</p>
<p>needs be designs other than commercial and which boded
</p>
<p>no good to the public peace. In the midst of all this
</p>
<p>laudation of Wilkinson the fact, that the privileges of
</p>
<p>commerce with the Spaniard which he had secured were
</p>
<p>limited to himself, was apparently ignored ; and if it was
</p>
<p>suggested that an individual could scarcely obtain fran-
</p>
<p>chises for his private benefit, which all the efiorts of Con-
</p>
<p>gress had been unavailing to obtain for the western people,
</p>
<p>without committing himself in some occult way to the
</p>
<p>power granting the favors, there were champions always
</p>
<p>at hand to attribute such suspicions to jealousy of a man
</p>
<p>whose energy equaled his popularity.

</p>
<p>There is no year more memorable in American history
</p>
<p>than that of 1787, durin^^ which the convention of dele-
</p>
<p>gates from the several States completed its great labor of
</p>
<p>framing the Constitution, and submitted its work to the
</p>
<p>separate States for ratification. The necessity for a gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, clothed with the power of making and the means
</p>
<p>to enforce laws, to take the place of the weak confedera-
</p>
<p>tion, which was little more than a sort of central agency y
</p>
<p>which could only recommend measures to the States, and
</p>
<p>whose labors for the commonweal were constantly
</p>
<p>thwarted by narrow jealousies within the States, w^iich
</p>
<p>frequently refused to comply with those recommendations,
</p>
<p>had become apparent to our statesmen. That " thirteen
</p>
<p>sovereignties pulling against each other, and all tugging at
</p>
<p>the federal head, will soon bring ruin on the whole," was
</p>
<p>the gloomy prognostication of the chief whose influence
</p>
<p>and authority and wisdom had surmounted and counter-
</p>
<p>acted during the war the evils of the system which he de-
</p>
<p>plored. The remedy he suggested was " a liberal and
</p>
<p>energetic constitution " to take the place of the " lax or in-
</p>
<p>efficient government" of the articles of confederation.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the one man to whose daily experience the de-
</p>
<p>fects in the federal system, which threatened our experi-
</p>
<p>ment of republican government with an early and dis-
</p>
<p>graceful failure and saddened the retirement of Washing-
</p>
<p>ton at Mt. Vernon, were more actively brought home

<p>than to any other, was the able and gallant General Henry

</p>
<p>Knox. As Secretary of War his life was made a burden
</p>
<p>by the applications on the one hand for protection against
</p>
<p>the Indians, and on the other by complaints that the
</p>
<p>whites were not only constantly encroaching on the In-
</p>
<p>dian lands  in defiance of treaties, the ink of which was
</p>
<p>scarcely dry  but were as continually murdering the In^
</p>
<p>dians themselves. Congress could place neither men nor
</p>
<p>money at his disposal, and the States refused to grant him
</p>
<p>either, with which only he could enforce the treaties
</p>
<p>which secured to the Indians their lands free from molesta-
</p>
<p>tion on the one hand, or punish their depredations and
</p>
<p>aggressions against the whites on the other, and thus pro-
</p>
<p>tect both races. Virginia assailed him with the most
</p>
<p>angry expostulations because the Indians were encouraged
</p>
<p>to their murderous attacks upon the Virginia settlers of
</p>
<p>the Kentucky district, by the retention of the military
</p>
<p>posts in the north-west by the British ; and to his every
</p>
<p>representation to the British ofiicers commanding those
</p>
<p>posts, that their retention was a violation of the treaty en-
</p>
<p>tered into by their government, the curt reply was re-
</p>
<p>turned, that the treaty had been violated by the refusal of
</p>
<p>Virginia and other States to repeal their laws suspending
</p>
<p>the collection of debts due to British citizens.
</p>
<p>"While continuing to inveigh against the secretary be-
</p>
<p>cause the posts were held, Virginia refused to repeal the
</p>
<p>laws which were made the pretext for holding them; and
</p>
<p>the States which most loudly clamored of the inefficiency
</p>
<p>of the secretary, for not compelling the British to evacu-
</p>
<p>ate the posts which they did not surrender voluntarily,
</p>
<p>were precisely those which most obstinately refused him
</p>
<p>the means with which to comply with such demands.
</p>
<p>If there was any one who felt equally with Knox, the
</p>
<p>urgent necessity that the United States should become a
</p>
<p>nation, it was the honest, the incorruptible, the courage-

<p>ous and patriotic John Jay. He was embarrassed by many
</p>
<p>of the difficulties which surrounded and hampered the
</p>
<p>Secretary of War. Besides these he was made to feel
</p>
<p>those which beset his negotiations with Spain. His con-
</p>
<p>victions as to our right to the navigation of the Missis-
</p>
<p>l^he Spanish Conspiracy. 141
</p>
<p>sippi, and of the ultimate value and importance of that
</p>
<p>navigation had been asserted and remained unaltered.
</p>
<p>His purpose never to barter away the right was unchange-
</p>
<p>able. But he had no conception of the rapidity of the
</p>
<p>growth of the west, and, in common with others, persuaded
</p>
<p>himself that the navigation would be of little practical
</p>
<p>value for a quarter of a century. By that time, if Spain
</p>
<p>did not concede that right, we would be able to enforce it
</p>
<p>by arms. In the meantime, we were in no condition for a
</p>
<p>war w^ith any power. Nor could the States, upon which
</p>
<p>the otherwise powerless central government must rely for
</p>
<p>men, money, and supplies, be united in a war for such a
</p>
<p>purpose. Under those circumstances it was, that he sug-
</p>
<p>gested to Congress a treaty with Spain, limited to twenty
</p>
<p>or thirty years, during which time we would forbear the use
</p>
<p>of that navigation, by accepting which Spain would admit
</p>
<p>the right after that time which was claimed by implication.
</p>
<p>He explained that if we insisted immediately on our right
</p>
<p>to navigate the Mississippi, Spain would at once strengthen
</p>
<p>her posts on the banks of that stream, " and bid us defi-
</p>
<p>ance with impunity, at least until the American nation
</p>
<p>shall become more really and truly a nation than it is at
</p>
<p>present." It was in order that the strength of an united
</p>
<p>country, acting under a vigorous central authority, might
</p>
<p>be exerted to enforce this and other rights, to maintain
</p>
<p>peace at home and to uphold republican credit, dignity
</p>
<p>and honor abroad, that Washington and Adams, the
</p>
<p>liberty-loving Jay, the gifted Hamilton, the gallant Knox,
</p>
<p>and the intrepid Henry Lee, with the bulk of the veterans
</p>
<p>who had borne the brunt of the revolution, desired that
</p>
<p>"the rope of sand" should give way to a cable of iron.
</p>
<p>The subject of intensest anxiety with those capable and
</p>
<p>far-seeing patriots was, whether the instrument by which
</p>
<p>the central authority ceased to be a Congress to advise

<p>the States, and became a Government of the People, would
</p>
<p>be ratified by the States. For months Virginia was in
</p>
<p>the doubtful column. To General Knox, Washington
</p>
<p>wrote from Mt. Vernon of "the unfair (I might, without
</p>
<p>much impropriety, have made use of a harsher expression)
</p>
<p>142 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>conduct, which has been practiced to raise the fears and to
</p>
<p>inflame the minds of the people" of Virginia. "Pains
</p>
<p>have not been wanting," he declared, "to incnlcate a be-
</p>
<p>lief that the proposed general government will, without
</p>
<p>scruple or delay, barter away their right to the navigation
</p>
<p>of the Mississippi." To Thomas Johnson, of Maryland,
</p>
<p>he wrote : " The sentiments of Kentucky are not known
</p>
<p>here yet (April 20, 1788). Independent of these, the par-
</p>
<p>ties in this State are pretty equally balanced." Later he
</p>
<p>wrote to John Jay, that little doubt remained of the rati-
</p>
<p>fication by Virginia " if no mistake has been made with
</p>
<p>respect to the Kentucky members." On the 4th of June,
</p>
<p>Mr. Madison wrote from Richmond to Washington : " I
</p>
<p>dare not, however, speak with certainty as to the decision.
</p>
<p>Kentucky has been extremely tainted, is supposed to be gen-
</p>
<p>erally adverse, and every kind of address is going on pri-
</p>
<p>vately to work on the local interests and prejudices of that
</p>
<p>and other quarters." Four days after the date of Madi-
</p>
<p>son's letter, Washington again wrote to Mr. Jay, that the
</p>
<p>friends of the Constitution "express apprehension of the.
</p>
<p>arts that may yet be practiced to excite alarms with the
</p>
<p>members from the western district (Kentucky)." A week
</p>
<p>later he wrote to General Knox: "Much appears to de-
</p>
<p>pend upon the final part which the Kentucky members
</p>
<p>will take; into whose minds unreal dangers, respecting
</p>
<p>the navigation of the Mississippi have been industriously
</p>
<p>infused."

<p>Virginia convention by the meagre majority of 89 yeas
</p>
<p>to 79 nays. Of the fourteen delegates from Kentucky
</p>
<p>only three voted for ratification ; two were silent ; and the
</p>
<p>others, unrelentingly hostile, gave negative votes. Among
</p>
<p>the last was every man upon whom Wilkinson, or Sebas-
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 143
</p>
<p>tian, or Jobn Brown, or Hary Iiines could have wielded
</p>
<p>the slightest influence. The three who helped to estab-
</p>
<p>lish our government were Rice Bullock,* Robert Brecken-
</p>
<p>ridge,t and Humphrey Marshall, all revolutionary oflicers.
</p>
<p>* He was the ancestor of the Bullocks of Shelby county and the
</p>
<p>father of the wife of Richard Butler, of Carrollton ; a near relative of
</p>
<p>the late Waller and Edmund Bullock, of Fayette, the progenitors of a
</p>
<p>worthy and a sterling race ; and, more remotely a kinsman of the family
</p>
<p>of the same name in Mason.
</p>
<p>t Alexander and Eobert Breckenridge were sons of Colonel Robert
</p>
<p>Breckenridge, of Virginia, by his first wife. Their mother was a Miss
</p>
<p>Poage, daughter of the first Robert Poage, of Augusta county, sister of
</p>
<p>William Poage, who was killed by the Indians near Harrodsburg, and
</p>
<p>aunt of the late General Robert Poage, of Mason county. Their mother
</p>
<p>dying when they were young, and their father forming a second mar-
</p>
<p>riage with Letitia, daughter of John Preston and sister of Colonel Wil-
</p>
<p>liam Preston, Alexander and Robert Breckenridge were bound as ap-
</p>
<p>prentices to Francis Smith (who had married another daughter of John
</p>
<p>Preston) to learn from him the trade of a carpenter. They became
</p>
<p>capital mechanics; but, preferring the career of arms, they both en-
</p>
<p>tered the American army early in the Revolution, became officers, and
</p>
<p>made good records for themselves. After the close of the war both came
</p>
<p>to Kentucky, locating at first in Fayette, but settling permanently in
</p>
<p>Jefferson. Alexander married the widow of Colonel John Floyd, and
</p>
<p>was the father of the late General James D. Breckenridge, of Louisville,
</p>
<p>and of Captain Henry Breckenridge, who was greatly admired for his
</p>
<p>talents, captivating manners and personal beauty. Alexander Brecken-
</p>
<p>ridge was a member of the convention of 1787, and, with Humphrey
</p>
<p>Marshall, helped to give its proceedings a peaceful and tranquilizing
</p>
<p>effect. He died early and young. Robert Breckenridge, who was the
</p>
<p>more energetic and intellectual of the two brothers, was a member of
</p>
<p>the Virginia Assembly of 1788; a member of the convention which
</p>
<p>ratified the constitution in the same year ; a member of the convention
</p>
<p>which framed the first constitution of Kentucky in 1792 ; was the

<p>Speaker of the first House of Representatives for the State, and was
</p>
<p>successively re-elected to that position three times. For a short time
</p>
<p>he was county lieutenant for Jefferson, but seems never to have taken
</p>
<p>any active part in actual fighting in the west. He and his younger
</p>
<p>half-brother, James Breckenridge, not only voted side by side with
</p>
<p>John and Humphrey Marshall to ratify the Constitution, but were also
</p>
<p>with them in the hearty and vigorous support they all gave to the ad-
</p>
<p>ministration of Washington, which John Breckenridge, the able, elo-
</p>
<p>quent and singularly beloved half-brother of the one and full brother of
</p>
<p>the other, did much to embarrass. John Breckenridge was the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent of the Democrat Society at Lexington, and the author of the Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky Resolutions of 1798-9. The four Breckenridge brothers were the
</p>
<p>gallant offspring of a brave and honest sire. The mother of John and

<p>They appear to have taken no active part in the debates
</p>
<p>of the convention. But their votes counted in the slender
</p>
<p>majority, which, had they been cast adversely, would have
</p>
<p>been reduced to four. It has been claimed that to their
</p>
<p>position and influence, as western members, it Avas due
</p>
<p>that the proposition carried at all. The last named had,
</p>
<p>two years before, boldly assailed the proposition that Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky should assume independence and sovereignty with-
</p>
<p>out and against law, and without the assent of Congress,
</p>
<p>had checked the audacity of Wilkinson, from whom he
</p>
<p>forced a modilication of his position and a ridiculous
</p>
<p>attempt to explain away his utterances. As a member of
</p>
<p>the convention called by Brown, Innes, Muter and Sebas-
</p>
<p>tian in May, 1787, he had assisted in defeating the propo-
</p>
<p>sitions designed to excite the fears and to inflame the
</p>
<p>minds of the people; and to compel an adjournment with-
</p>
<p>out action of any kind. As a member of the convention
</p>
<p>which met in the fall of that year, he had aided in giving
</p>
<p>to its action a peaceful direction and tranquilizing efl:ect.
</p>
<p>And now, in 1788, at the aspiring age of twenty-eight
</p>
<p>years, with the full knowledge that the overwhelming
</p>
<p>mass of his immediate constituents were opposed to the
</p>
<p>action to which he was impelled by his own clear judg-
</p>
<p>ment and solemn convictions of duty, he, alone of the
</p>
<p>delegation from Fayette, contributed his vote and the
</p>
<p>whole weight of his strenuous exertions to the establish-
</p>
<p>ment of the government which lifted our country from
</p>
<p>the slough into which it had sunk in its weakness. For
</p>
<p>this vote he was most bitterly assailed. His own reasons
</p>
<p>therefor are interesting as indicating the character of the
</p>
<p>James, Letitia Preston, transmitted to her descendants her intellect,
</p>
<p>her elevated character, her comeliness and her grace. John and
</p>
<p>James were cousins-german to John Brown ; but they were so differ-
</p>
<p>ent from him in every mental, moral and physical characteristic, that

<p>no one would ever have suspected that one drop of kindred blood
</p>
<p>flowed in their veins. General Robert Breckenridge never married.

<p>He accumulated a large fortune, which he left to Eliza, only daughter

<p>" He had participated in the scenes of the revohition heard the want
</p>
<p>of power in Congress, often deplored, and witnessed its defects, as to the
</p>
<p>Indian afiairs, and the Union generally ; to which he was strongh^ at-
</p>
<p>tached ; he had also been an observer of General Wilkinson's conduct,
</p>
<p>which was not to be accounted for upon legitimate motives ; and he
</p>
<p>deemed the new constitution an improvement of the federal system 
</p>
<p>after hearing it ably discussed ; his own convictions he could not vio-
</p>
<p>late ; these taught him that he was subserving the real interests of his
</p>
<p>constituents and according to these he acted ; putting to hazard and at
</p>
<p>naught his own popularity. Thinking withall, for his experience was
</p>
<p>yet in its bud, that the people possessed intelligence, and justice enough
</p>
<p>to perceive and applaud the propriety of the course pursued."
</p>
<p>Colonel John Mason Brown, in his " Political Begin-
</p>
<p>nings," states, that " the bent of educated opinion in Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky was evidently in favor of the federal constitution,
</p>
<p>but insisted on certain necessary, amendments;" and, that
</p>
<p>while Thomas Allin and Matthew Walton, two of the
</p>
<p>members of the " Danville Political Club" voted against
</p>
<p>the ratification of the constitution, " the other members
</p>
<p>seem to have been, without exception, zealous supporters
</p>
<p>of the new plan for Union and constitutional govern-
</p>
<p>ment." But the fiercest assailants of the constitution
</p>
<p>avowed themselves as favorable to " the new^ plan for
</p>
<p>Union and constitutional government." Tiiey found it
</p>
<p>more convenient to " i^isist on certain necessary amendments "
</p>
<p>merely, than it was to avow themselves distinctly as op-
</p>
<p>posed to a change from the " old plan " under w^hich ship-
</p>
<p>"vvreck and chaos were impending. Nevertheless, as the
</p>
<p>several state conventions were not agreed as to what
</p>
<p>amendments were " necessary," and as they had no power
</p>
<p>to enact any amendments whatever ; and as the only
</p>
<p>question presented to those conventions was whether they

<p>out in its provisions;  it inevitably resulted that those
</p>
<p>who " insisted on certain necessary amendments" whether
</p>
<p>they were sincere as Henry proved himself to be, or
</p>
<p>hypocritical as others were, were hostile to the constitution

</p>
<p>the rejection of " the new plan for Union and constitu-
</p>
<p>tional government," upon which the state conventions
</p>
<p>were called to act. The sagacious mind of Washington,
</p>
<p>which was rarely at fault, saw, " that this, (the constitu-
</p>
<p>tion as presented), or a dissolution of the Union, awaits
</p>
<p>our choice, and is the only alternative before us." To La-
</p>
<p>fayette he wrote his maturest conviction, that, in case the
</p>
<p>constitution should he rejected, and another general con-
</p>
<p>vention should be called, its members " would not be able
</p>
<p>to agree upon any system whatever," that many of the
</p>
<p>objections that had been urged " would operate equally
</p>
<p>against any efficient government that might be proposed , "
</p>
<p>and that there was " no alternative, no hope of alteration,
</p>
<p>no intermediate resting-place between the adoption of this
</p>
<p>and a recurrence to an unqualified state of anarchy, with
</p>
<p>all its deplorable consequences."
</p>
<p>There were some members of that " Political Club,"
</p>
<p>who wished the constitution ratilied. But there were
</p>
<p>others beside Thomas Allin and Matthew Walton, (who
</p>
<p>voted against the ratification,) who were in line with " the
</p>
<p>bent of educated opinion in Kentucky, which insisted on cer-
</p>
<p>tain necessary amendynents f which insistence involved the
</p>
<p>rejection of the constitution, taking the risk that a second
</p>
<p>general convention would be called, with the all but cer-
</p>
<p>tainty that, if ever called, it could never form a scheme of
</p>
<p>government upon which the discordant elements, inflamed
</p>
<p>by passion and prejudice, could agree. It is not to be sup-
</p>
<p>posed that the author of " Political Beginnings " intended
</p>
<p>to be understood, that his grandfather and his grand-
</p>
<p>father's brother, James, and their friends, Innes and
</p>
<p>Sebastian, who were all members of the " Political Club,"
</p>
<p>were out of sympathy with " the bent of educated opinion
</p>
<p>in Kentucky." It is true, the author asserts that when

</p>
<p>adopting" the constitution; that John Brown was in

<p>cordial agreement with Madison in regard to the constitu-

<p>was chosen as a delegate to Congress by the Virginia as-
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 147
</p>
<p>sembly. But underneath all this mass of assertion, the
</p>
<p>substantial truth seems to be, that John Brown was one of
</p>
<p>those educated men in Kentucky who " insisted on certain
</p>
<p>necessary amendments," and, made their previous adoption
</p>
<p>a condition precedent to the ratification of the constitu-
</p>
<p>tion, to which, without those amendments, he was opposed.
</p>
<p>This is corroborated by Humphrey Marshall's statement,
</p>
<p>made during the life time of John Brown, and which was
</p>
<p>not denied, that, during Marshall's attendance upon the
</p>
<p>Virginia convention, he had " been abundantly forwarned
</p>
<p>of the loss of popularity " if he voted for the ratification,
</p>
<p>" and admonished, that it was Mr. Broion's decided opinion,
</p>
<p>rendered in a letter to a mem,ber, that the constitution ought to
</p>
<p>be REJECTED." The Wilkinson party in Kentucky, of
</p>
<p>whom Brown was one, were known to be almost, if not
</p>
<p>quite, unanimously opposed to the constitution. This was
</p>
<p>especially the case with those who had been active, as
</p>
<p>Brown had been, in producing and exciting public clamor
</p>
<p>on the subject of the navigation of the Mississippi. It
</p>
<p>has been seen from the letters of Washington, that the
</p>
<p>opposition to the constitution in Kentucky was mainly
</p>
<p>from that faction.
</p>
<p>In Littell's pamphlet, published by John Brown and
</p>
<p>others of that faction, the statement was made that
</p>
<p>" there was much reason to fear that bartering away the
</p>
<p>navigation of the Mississippi would be one of its (the
</p>
<p>new government's) first acts." It can scarcely be doubted
</p>
<p>that John Brown, who, in 1806, thus asserted that there
</p>
<p>was "much reason," in ITovember, 1788, after the Consti-
</p>
<p>tution had been adopted, for the ' fear' that this bartering
</p>
<p>away " would be one of the first acts " of the new govern-
</p>
<p>ment, exerted his influence, so far as it went, to prevent the
</p>
<p>establishment of that government, which there was much
</p>
<p>reason to fear, would do that thing. That he succeeded

<p>On the 12th of November, 1787, the name of John
</p>
<p>Brown appears for the last time on the journal of the Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia Senate.* To him the duty of placing before Con-

<p>*This was the date of the passage of the second series of resolutions
</p>
<p>in regard to the navigation of the Mississippi by the House of Delegates,
</p>
<p>which were never introduced into the Senate, and a transcript of which
</p>
<p>John Brown did not even take the trouble to carry with him to Con-
</p>
<p>gress. In fact these resolutions, which are those quoted in the " Polit-
</p>
<p>ical Beginnings" as having been passed in 1786, never were forwarded to
</p>
<p>the Congressional delegation. [See letter of Madison to Edmund Ran-
</p>
<p>dolph, Sept. 2-4, 1788, Madison Papers, Vol. II., page 677.] The Mr. Thrus-
</p>
<p>ton, by whom they were called up in the House of Delegates, was the gal-
</p>
<p>lant Colonel Charles Mynn Thruston, a worthy scion of the cavaliers, not
</p>
<p>of the rakehelly and swashbuckler variety, but of the nobler type of the
</p>
<p>stern Strafford, the chivalrous Ormond and the princely Hamilton. He
</p>
<p>descended from a family which became early seated in Gloucester,
</p>
<p>where he was born. His wife was a member of the numerous and
</p>
<p>highly reputable family of Buckner. They were the parents of Buck-
</p>
<p>ner Thruston, who became distinguished as a judge and as a U. S. Sen-
</p>
<p>ator from Kentucky. Among the Kentucky descendants of Colonel

<p>gress, the respectful application by the convention of Sep-
</p>
<p>tember, 1787, that assent should be given to the establish-
</p>
<p>ment of the independence of Kentucky, in accordance
</p>
<p>with the conditions expressed in the act of the Virginia
</p>
<p>Assembly (of January 10, 1787), and for the admission
</p>
<p>into the confederation of the new State to be thus erected,
</p>
<p>had been expressly entrusted. But no quorum of Con-
</p>
<p>gress met until the last of January, 1788 ; the application
</p>
<p>was not presented by Mr. Brown until the 29th of Feb-
</p>
<p>ruary. The reason for the delay assigned by Mr. Brown :
</p>
<p>that "great part of the winter and spring, there was not
</p>
<p>a representation of the States sufficient to proceed to this
</p>
<p>business : " was probably the true cause. Even after a
</p>
<p>quorum was had, the members were too much occupied
</p>
<p>with watching the reports of the action of the several
</p>
<p>States upon the question of ratifying the new Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion (many of the members of Congress were also dele-
</p>
<p>gates to the respective State conventions) to give proper
</p>
<p>attention to their immediate business.
</p>
<p>It was not until the 30th of May that Congress fixed
</p>
<p>upon the 2d of June as the day for considering the appli-
</p>
<p>cation. On that day Congress, sitting as a committee of
</p>
<p>the whole, cheerfully adopted the report presented by Mr.
</p>
<p>Otis, of Massachusetts, asserting the expediency of " erect-
</p>
<p>ing " the Kentucky district into an " independent state,"
</p>
<p>and referring the application of the convention and the
</p>
<p>acts of the Assembly of Virginia to a committee to be
</p>
<p>composed of one member from each state, to prepare and
</p>
<p>report an act assenting to the " independence of the said
</p>
<p>district of Kentucky, and for receiving the same into the
</p>
<p>tered. He was promoted to a Colonelcy, but as the regiment to
</p>
<p>which he was appointed could not be raised, he became a supernumer-
</p>
<p>ary. After drawing the sword he never resumed the gown ; but be-
</p>
<p>came presiding judge of the Frederick Court, and frequently repre-

<p>sented that county in the assembly. In 1809 he removed to Louisiana,
</p>
<p>where he died in 1812. The battle of New Orleans was fought upon the
</p>
<p>place of his interment. The presentation of these resolutions by this
</p>
<p>gallant veteran, and their advocacy by such men as Patrick Henry,
</p>
<p>George Mason, and Nicholas, sufficiently refute the pretense that their
</p>
<p>passage was "procured from tlie assembly " by John Brown.

<p>Union as a member thereof in a mode conformable to the
</p>
<p>articles of confederation." There were but eleven of the
</p>
<p>states then having delegates present, and to a committee
</p>
<p>of that number Congress the next day referred the pa-
</p>
<p>pers, with directions to draft and report a bill to give
</p>
<p>effect to the sense of that body as it had been thus form-
</p>
<p>ally declared. Among the members of this committee
</p>
<p>there was no difficulty in agreeing upon the terms of the
</p>
<p>bill ; nor is there an iota of testimony to sustain the asser-
</p>
<p>tion made by John Brown in his letter to Muter, that the
</p>
<p>delay in reporting the bill which was drawn by that com-
</p>
<p>mittee was occasioned by the opposition of a majority of
</p>
<p>its members to the measure.
</p>
<p>Ere three weeks had passed, however, intelligence was
</p>
<p>brought that New Hampshire had transmitted her ratifi-
</p>
<p>cation of the Constitution, which gave the number requis-
</p>
<p>ite for its adoption and the establishment of the Kepublic
</p>
<p>of the People. Moreover, though no formal and official
</p>
<p>notification of Virginia's action on the 26th of June had
</p>
<p>been received ; yet, by the 1st of July, Mr. Madison, fresh
</p>
<p>from the scenes of his polemic triumj)hs, had arrived in
</p>
<p>New York ; and it was known that Virginia, of which
</p>
<p>Kentucky was a part, already made the te7ilh of the assent-
</p>
<p>ing commonwealths, that the confederacy had become
</p>
<p>moribund, and that the new Union was about to be
</p>
<p>launched upon its career of magnificent achievement.
</p>
<p>That the confederacy was on the eve of dissolution, that
</p>
<p>the rightful powers of its Congress to grant the appli-
</p>
<p>cation had thus terminated, was the ample justification for
</p>
<p>the request (on the 2d of July) made by the committee on
</p>
<p>whom had been imposed the duty of drawing a bill for
</p>
<p>that purpose, to be discharged. The bill, which had been
</p>
<p>drawn by the committee, was then promptly offered by
</p>
<p>John Brown, was seconded by Edward Carrington, and

</p>
<p>was made the special order for the next day. When it
</p>
<p>was then called up by Mr. Brown for consideration, a sub-
</p>
<p>stitute was offered by Mr. Dane, of Massachusetts, w^ho
</p>
<p>made a motion to postpone the bill until a vote could be
</p>
<p>had upon his substitute. As eftbrts have been made to

</p>
<p>create the belief that this motion proceeded from hostility
</p>
<p>to Kentucky, and irom jealousy of the South, it is worthy of
</p>
<p>note that tlie motion for postponement Avas seconded by
</p>
<p>Mr. Tucker, of South Carolina, and was supported by
</p>
<p>every southern man present except the Virginia delega-
</p>
<p>tion ; and that then the substitute itself was carried by the
</p>
<p>votes of all the states, including Virginia, Mr. Brown him-
</p>
<p>self remaining silent, and Mr. Yeates, of New York, vot-
</p>
<p>ing in the negative. That substitute, which exhibits the
</p>
<p>just, fair and conciliatory spirit of Congress, and of its
</p>
<p>northern members whose motives were aspersed by John
</p>
<p>Brown ;  which so concisely states the facts and motives
</p>
<p>that influenced the wise action, and expresses so clearly
</p>
<p>the unanswerable logic of the situation, is as follows, viz :
</p>
<p>" Whereas application has been lately made to Congress by the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature of Virginia, and the district of Kentucky, for the admission of
</p>
<p>the said district into the Federal Union, as a separate member thereof
</p>
<p>on the terms contained in the acts of the said legislature, and in the
</p>
<p>resolutions of the said district relative to the premises. And whereas.
</p>
<p>Congress having fully considered the subject, did on the third day of
</p>
<p>June last resolve that it is expedient that the said district be erected
</p>
<p>into a sovereign and independent state, and a separate member of the
</p>
<p>federal union, and appointed a committee to report an act accordingly,
</p>
<p>which committee on the second instant was discharged  it appearing
</p>
<p>that nine states had adopted the constitution of the United States,
</p>
<p>lately submitted to conventions of the people.
</p>
<p>And whereas a new confederacy is formed among the ratifying states,
</p>
<p>and there is reason to believe that the State of Virginia, including the
</p>
<p>said district, did on the twenty-sixth of June last, become a member of
</p>
<p>'the said confederacy.
</p>
<p>And whereas an act of Congress in the present state of the govern-
</p>
<p>ment of the country, severing a part of said state from the other part
</p>
<p>thereof, and admitting it into the confederacy, formed by the articles of
</p>
<p>confederation and perpetual union, as an independent member thereof,

</p>
<p>may be attended with many inconveniences, while it can have no effect
</p>
<p>to make the said district a separate member of the federal union formed
</p>
<p>by the adoption of the said constitution, and therefore it must be mani-
</p>
<p>festly improper for Congress assembled under the said articles of con-
</p>
<p>federation to adopt any other measures relative to the premises, than
</p>
<p>those which express their sense that the said district as a separate state
</p>
<p>be admitted in the Union, as soon as circumstances shall permit proper
</p>
<p>measures to be adopted for that purpose :
</p>
<p>Resolved, That a copy of the proceedings of Congress relative to the
</p>
<p>independence of the district of Kentucky, be transmitted to the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature of Virginia, and also to Samuel McDowell, Esquire, late president
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 153
</p>
<p>of said convention, and that the said legislature and the inliabitants of
</p>
<p>the district aforesaid be informed, that as the constitution of the United
</p>
<p>States is now ratified, Congress think it unadvisahle to adopt any fur-
</p>
<p>ther measures for admitting the district of Kentucky into the federal
</p>
<p>union as an independent member thereof under the articles of confed-
</p>
<p>eration and perpetual union ; but that Congress thinking it expedient
</p>
<p>that the said district be made a separate state and member of the Union,
</p>
<p>as soon after proceedings shall commence under the said constitution,
</p>
<p>as circumstances shall permit, recommend it to the said legislature, and
</p>
<p>to the inhabitants of the said district, so to alter their acts and resolu-
</p>
<p>tions relative to the premises, as to render them conformable to the
</p>
<p>provisions made in the said constitution, to the end that no impediment
</p>
<p>may be in the way of the speedy accomplishment of this important
</p>
<p>business."
</p>
<p>Had it been deemed proper to add aught to this cogent
</p>
<p>reasoning and just conclusion, it might truthfully have
</p>
<p>been stated, that both the acts of Virginia had unmistak-
</p>
<p>ably evinced her determination, that the district should
</p>
<p>not be taken from under her authority until provision had
</p>
<p>been previously made for its admission into the Union ;
</p>
<p>and that the unavoidable inference remained, that it was
</p>
<p>equally her will, now that she had entered into the new
</p>
<p>Union, that the same condition should apply as to Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky's admission into it; that recognition of the inde-
</p>
<p>pendence of Kentucky and her admission into the confed-
</p>
<p>eration would neither have admitted her into that new
</p>
<p>Union, to provide for which the Congress of the confeder-
</p>
<p>ation had no power, nor have imposed lupon the State
</p>
<p>thus created any obligation to seek such admission ; that
</p>
<p>admission into the new Union could only be obtained by
</p>
<p>the States of the confederation by ratifying the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion, against which the large majority of the Kentucky del-
</p>
<p>egates to the Virginia convention had voted, and to which
</p>
<p>an overwhelming majority of her people were known to

<p>be opposed; and that the only eifect of receiving her then
</p>
<p>into the fast declining confederation would have been to
</p>
<p>have soon left her free from all political bonds to the
</p>
<p>United States, an independent and sovereign State, sep-
</p>
<p>arated from them by the barriers of the AUeghanies, at
</p>
<p>liberty to make her own treaties and to form alliances
</p>
<p>wheresoever she listed ;  an almost certain prey to the

</p>
<p>Briton, who still held with strong hand the military posts
</p>
<p>in the north, or to the Spaniard, whose cannon com-
</p>
<p>manded the hanks and mouth of the Mississippi, whose
</p>
<p>minister at Xew York was even then intriguing with
</p>
<p>the western delegate in Congress, and whose governor
</p>
<p>of Louisiana had already bought Kentucky's most bril-
</p>
<p>liant and most influential citizen.
</p>
<p>Of this determination by Congress, Colonel Brown ad-
</p>
<p>mits, that it was a "right conclusion," that the "logic of
</p>
<p>the situation was all with the substitute moved by Mr.
</p>
<p>Dane, of Massachusetts." "This substitute," Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown informs us, " was temperate and conciliatory in
</p>
<p>language, perfectly fair in its statement of the facts, and
</p>
<p>it embodied a series of explanations and reasons that were
</p>
<p>indisputably sound," For this substitute, every southern
</p>
<p>delegate in Congress, except John Brown, who was silent,
</p>
<p>voted. That he "held his peace" is explained by his
</p>
<p>shortly after urging the people of the district to declare
</p>
<p>independence and assert sovereignty, without regard to
</p>
<p>the act of Virginia or to the assent of Congress. By this
</p>
<p>step Kentucky would have been placed, so far as the act
</p>
<p>itself could have been made effective, outside of the con-
</p>
<p>federation, as well as outside of the Union of the Consti-
</p>
<p>tution. This "wise action" of Congress was represented
</p>
<p>by John Brown in Littell's pamphlet, " to have been owing
</p>
<p>to the malign influence of an eastern politician, wdiose tal-
</p>
<p>ents for intrigue have become famous throughout the civ-
</p>
<p>ilized world" (probably meaning thereby the able and
</p>
<p>patriotic Jay). "The conduct of Qongress," he declared,
</p>
<p>referring to Dane's substitute, which his grandson so
</p>
<p>highly commends, and for which his colleagues voted, " on
</p>
<p>the application of the district, manifested the existence of
</p>
<p>some sinister political design." He explained that this
</p>
<p>sinister design was to give up to Spain the right of navi-

<p>gating the Mississippi, and to oppose the progress of the
</p>
<p>west and the creation of new States therein, though he
</p>
<p>knew that the same Congress had most emphatically re-
</p>
<p>pudiated the sinister design which he attributed to it, and
</p>
<p>had already made provision for the creation of new States

</p>
<p>in the west. This was a repetition of one of the scandal-
</p>
<p>ous misrepresentations which Washington so bitterly con-
</p>
<p>demned, and which was resorted to by William Grayson,
</p>
<p>in the Virginia convention, in his frantic endeavors to de-
</p>
<p>feat the ratification of the Constitution, to inflame the
</p>
<p>Kentucky members of that body, and to prevent the es
</p>
<p>tablishment of a government whose laws the demagogues
</p>
<p>could no longer with impunity defy.
</p>
<p>To Oliver Pollock, of whose intimate association with
</p>
<p>the Spaniards and interest in the trade with Louisiana and
</p>
<p>the west he had knowledge,  to Oliver Pollock, John
</p>
<p>Brown communicated " in confidence " his determination
</p>
<p>" to return home, and, on his arrival, to call for a general
</p>
<p>assembly of his fellow-citizens, in order to proceed imme-
</p>
<p>diately to declare themselves independent, and to propose
</p>
<p>to Spain the opening of a commercial intercourse with
</p>
<p>reciprocal advantages." Pollock disclosed to Miro this
</p>
<p>intention, which Brown declared to him. The Intendant
</p>
<p>wrote to his court, under date of November 8, 1788, that
</p>
<p>Valdes, the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, might
</p>
<p>" rest assured, that Brown, on his arrival in Kentucky,
</p>
<p>finding Wilkinson and his associates disposed to surren-
</p>
<p>der themselves up to Spain, or at least to put themselves
</p>
<p>under her protection, will easily join them."* The " in-
</p>
<p>* " Oliver Pollock, a citizen of I'hiladelpbia, who arrived here three
</p>
<p>days ago, in a vessel from Martinique, has disclosed to me that Brown,
</p>
<p>a member of Congress, who is a man of jjroperty in Kentucky, told him
</p>
<p>in confidence that, in the debates of that body on the question of the
</p>
<p>independence of that territory, he saw clearly that the intention of his
</p>
<p>colleagues was, that Kentucky should remain under the jurisdiction of
</p>
<p>Congress, like , the county of Illinois, and that a governor should be
</p>
<p>appointed by them for that province as for the other; but that, as this
</p>
<p>was opposed to the welfare of the inhabitants of Kentucky, he was de-
</p>

<p>dependence" which John Brown thus announced his pur-
</p>
<p>pose to urge Kentucky to declare, was not simply inde-
</p>
<p>pendence of Virginia, but of the confederation and of the

<p>one nor under the constitution of the other, could a State
</p>
<p>make any treaty or form any alliance, commercial or oth-
</p>
<p>wise, with a foreign power.
</p>
<p>The confidential interview with Pollock was evidently
</p>
<p>after John Brown had ascertained from Gardoqui the na-
</p>
<p>ture of the instructions he had received from Madrid in
</p>
<p>the preceding March, as the direct result of the memorial
</p>
<p>of Wilkinson, which had been forwarded to Spain in Sep-
</p>
<p>tember, 1787, and of the urgent advice of the gifted i^Ta-
</p>
<p>varro, that no time should be lost in the adoption of meas-
</p>
<p>ures necessary to populate Louisiana and to procure a sepa-
</p>
<p>ration of the west from, the Union. "^^ It was discerned by
</p>
<p>statesmen at Madrid that the republican institutions of
</p>
<p>America were inimical to those of Spain, and they fore-
</p>
<p>saw that the growth and extension of the Union would
</p>
<p>ultimately endanger the Spanish possessions of Louisiana,
</p>
<p>Texas and Mexico, Faithful to his instructions to labor
</p>
<p>for the dismemberment of that LTnion, and anticipating
</p>
<p>the action of Congress, Gardoqui took occasion " to culti-
</p>
<p>and his associates disposed to surrender themselves up to Spain, or at
</p>
<p>least, to put themselves under her protection, will easily join them, and
</p>
<p>it is probable, as Wilkinson has already foretold it, that, next spring, I
</p>
<p>shall have to receive here a deputation appointed in due form. I acted
</p>
<p>toward Pollock with a great deal of caution, and answered him as one
</p>
<p>to whom had been communicated some new and unlooked-for informa-
</p>
<p>tion, giving him to understand that I could not pledge to him my sup-

</p>
<p>duce such topics as he (I) thought would produce good re-
</p>
<p>sults " for the accomplishment of the scheme of disunion
</p>
<p>he had been ordered to prosecute. In those frequent in-
</p>
<p>terviews held prior to and after the decision of Congress,
</p>
<p>Gardoqui " touched upon those obstacles imposed by
</p>
<p>our treaties with other nations, which forbade us accord-
</p>
<p>ing any extension of favor to his section of country while
</p>
<p>pertaining to the United States," and " artfully insinuated
</p>
<p>that only themselves could remove the difficulty, inasmuch as
</p>
<p>if separated they would afford excuse for regarding them as
</p>
<p>an interior district without maritime designs, and perhaps
</p>
<p>we could devise some plan for adjusting- the markets so
</p>
<p>much needed in our own possessions." The wily Span-
</p>
<p>iard w^as too polite, even had he not been too circumspect,
</p>
<p>to at once bluntly tell the listening statesman from the
</p>
<p>w^est, that his Catholic majesty, warned by the most astute
</p>
<p>of his counsellors of the perils to be apprehended from
</p>
<p>the future vigor of the young giant, if time and room
</p>
<p>were given for its development, was intent, above all other
</p>
<p>things, on dismembering the Union, and strangling repub-
</p>
<p>lican liberty in its germ. ]^or did he explain in detail, that
</p>
<p>one great motive of the Spanish diplomacy in refusing to
</p>
<p>listen to any suggestion that the United States had a right
</p>
<p>to navigate the Mississippi, was to use that matter as its
</p>
<p>most valuable aid in accomplishing its design of disunion.
</p>
<p>But he did inform Mr. Brown, as he had all along in-
</p>
<p>formed Jay, that this right on the part of the United
</p>
<p>States would never be admitted by Spain. And, however
</p>
<p>his suggestions of treason to the world's hope of freedom
</p>
<p>may have been veiled by the pretext, that treaties with
</p>
<p>other nations prevented the extension of this privilege to
</p>
<p>the people of Kentucky so long as they continued a part

<p>of the Union ; but that, if Kentucky would separate from

<p>the Union, then those treaties might be evaded on the
</p>
<p>ground that, as an interior state, she was without mari-
</p>
<p>time ambitions ;  still, Gardoqui intended to give and did
</p>
<p>give Mr. Brown distinctly to understand, and the member
</p>
<p>of Congress fully understood, that so long as Kentucky
</p>
<p>158 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>remained a part of the Union, the privilege of navigating
</p>
<p>the Mississippi would never be granted to them by Spain.
</p>
<p>He was given to understand, toO, and did understand,
</p>
<p>that if Kentucky would first withdraw from the Union,
</p>
<p>then, and not until then, upon that fundamental condi-
</p>
<p>tion precedent, and upon no other, Gardoqui was author-
</p>
<p>ized to negotiate with the state, thus separated from and
</p>
<p>independent of the Union, for the extension of that privi-
</p>
<p>lege to her people. There was no room for misunder-
</p>
<p>standing Gardoqui's proposition, nor did Brown misap-
</p>
<p>prehend Gardoqui's object. As the words fell from the
</p>
<p>lips of the Spaniard he "carefully observed" the expres-
</p>
<p>sion of Brown's countenance, and it " seemed to him (me)
</p>
<p>that he (I) could discern the satisfaction it gave."
</p>
<p>Brown promised to consider the proposition, and to
</p>
<p>have further talk with Gardoqui upon the subject. lie
</p>
<p>carefully revolved the proposition in his own mind, view-
</p>
<p>ing it in its relations to the future of the Kentucky people,
</p>
<p>and, beyond doubt, in its probable bearings upon his own
</p>
<p>fortunes. Then, several days after the interview in which
</p>
<p>he had given Gardoqui his promise, he sought the latter at
</p>
<p>the Minister's own residence. There he renewed with the
</p>
<p>Spaniard the discussion of the interesting topic. Gardoqui
</p>
<p>then "repeated the same and other observations"  be-
</p>
<p>coming more direct and bolder as Brown evidently pre-
</p>
<p>pared for capitulation. It is scarcely a mere fancy, that
</p>
<p>the Spaniard drew an alluring picture of the profits and
</p>
<p>wealth to be reaped for the Kentucky people by the pros-
</p>
<p>pective commerce with Louisiana and the rich islands of
</p>
<p>the gulf, to which they were invited. Due appreciation
</p>
<p>of the good manners which distinguish the Castilian gen-
</p>

</p>
<p>cuniary or other personal reward to Mr. Brown as the

<p>disclosed; yet it is scarcely possible that no such consider-
</p>
<p>ation found a lodgment in Brown's own mind. He ex-
</p>
<p>pressed himself" as quite satisfied and obliged " to Gardo-
</p>
<p>qui for the offer which the latter had made to him. And
</p>
<p>he " admitted, in covjidence/' that he had, by a messenger,
</p>

</p>
<p>already announced to his constituents the action of Con-
</p>
<p>gress, and that he had " communicated to them 1\\q favor-
</p>
<p>able disposition he liad discovered " in Gardoqui to grant
</p>
<p>the navigation of the Mississippi as the price of their
</p>
<p>separation from the Union.
</p>
<p>He further assured Gardoqui that, as a consequence of
</p>
<p>the information he had forwarded to his constituents of
</p>
<p>the "good disposition he had discovered" in the Spanish
</p>
<p>minister, he hoped to " communicate matters of import-
</p>
<p>ance productive of benefit to that country." By this he
</p>
<p>meant the Spaniard to understand, and Gardoqui did so
</p>
<p>understand, that he hoped to soon communicate to Gar-
</p>
<p>doqui that the district had declared her independence, as-
</p>
<p>sumed sovereignty and had w^ithdravi^n from the Union,
</p>
<p>as Gardoqui desired, so as to entitle her people to the
</p>
<p>" benefit " of the promise Gardoqui had made. He did not
</p>
<p>forget to tell the Spaniard that a convention would be
</p>
<p>held in Danville in July  the month in which their con-
</p>
<p>versation was held,  and " that he expected it would re-
</p>
<p>solve upon the erection of an independent State,"  which
</p>
<p>could only be done by violating all the conditions of the
</p>
<p>act of the Virginia Assembly, and, as the Congress had
</p>
<p>made no provision to admit the State so erected, would
</p>
<p>have disconnected it equally from the confederation which
</p>
<p>was about to die and the Union which was in process of
</p>
<p>accouchement. It was thus alone he could have hoped
</p>
<p>that any " 667ie^^ " would accrue to the people of Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky from the " favorable disposition he had discovered "
</p>
<p>in Gardoqui. He told Gardoqui, that he would leave New
</p>
<p>York the 1st of August, and that he would arrive in
</p>
<p>Kentucky in time to " inform " his constituents of the
</p>
<p>proposals made by Spain, and to " aid in what he had dis-

<p>upon the hateful head and deadly coils of the arch enemy

<p>Subjoined is the full text of Gardoqui's dispatch of July 25, 1788, as
</p>
<p>copied from the ' Political Beginnings," page 146, viz.:
</p>
<p>" In my dispatches of ISth April, I had the honor to inform your ex-
</p>
<p>cellency of that movement which the District of Kentucky had renewed
</p>
<p>in consequence of the consent given by Virginia (of which it forms a
</p>
<p>part) to its recognition and admission by Congress as a sovereign, inde-
</p>
<p>pendent state. The matter was agitated vigorously of late, and a com-
</p>
<p>mittee named, composed of one member from each state, and after-
</p>
<p>wards upon consideration (as the order of the day) in a general session
</p>
<p>of Congress, it was agreed that the demand was just; though in view of
</p>
<p>the various circumstances of the time, it was referred to the new gov-
</p>
<p>ernment.
</p>
<p>" This determination was very distasteful to those who promoted the
</p>
<p>separation of the district, and particularly so to ]\Ir. John Brown, a
</p>
<p>landed proprietor and resident in that District, who was interested in
</p>
<p>that matter, among others, as member in Congress. Finally the busi-
</p>
<p>ness was passed over to the new government, in which the State of Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia will be included as part, because of her consent to join the con-
</p>
<p>federation, given before the fourth of the present month. Foreseeing
</p>
<p>some of these occurrences, I took occasion during the past year to cul-
</p>
<p>tivate the friendship of the aforesaid Brown, and to introduce such
</p>
<p>topics as I thought would produce good results.
</p>
<p>"Our friendship gradually increased and my sentiments naturally
</p>
<p>made an impi-ession on him, inasmuch as they touched upon those
</p>
<p>obstacles, imposed by our treaties with other nations, which forbade us
</p>
<p>according any extension of favor to his section of country while per-
</p>
<p>taining to the United .States, artfully insinuating that only themselves
</p>
<p>could remove the difticulty ; inasmuch as if separated they would afford
</p>
<p>excuse for regarding them as an interior district without maritime de-
</p>
<p>signs, and perhaps we could devise some plan for adjusting the markets
</p>
<p>so much needed in some of our possessions.

<p>" I carefully observed his appearance as I told him this, and it seemed
</p>
<p>to me that I could discern the satisfaction it gave. He said he would
</p>
<p>reflect upon it, and would see me and talk at leisure vipon the subject.
</p>
<p>Several days passed and he came to this house, where a few days since
</p>
<p>we had a long conversation in which we renewed the subject, and I re-
</p>
<p>peated the same and other observations. He seemed quite satisfied
</p>
<p>and obliged to me, and admitted, in confidence, that he had, by a mes-
</p>
<p>senger who had left some days before, communicated to his constitu-
</p>
<p>uents the decision of Congress concerning the separation, referring to
</p>
<p>the favorable disposition he had discovered in me, and, in short, that
</p>
<p>lie hoped to communicate matters of importance productive of benefit
</p>
<p>to that country. He told me, in conclusion, that this month the con-
</p>
<p>vention would meet, and that he expected it would resolve upon the

</p>
<p>John Brown was fresh from tliese conferences with the
</p>
<p>Spanish minister when he made to Oliver Pollock the
</p>
<p>" conlideutial" declaration of his purpose, which, as it
</p>
<p>appears from Miro's dispatch to his Court, Pollock
</p>
<p>in turn shortly after repeated to Miro, and which was
</p>
<p>identical with that related by Gardoqui. The very na-
</p>
<p>ture of these conferences excludes from the probabilities
</p>
<p>the suggestion of Colonel John Mason Brown, that Madi-
</p>
<p>son, or some other member of the Virginia delegation,
</p>
<p>was present thereat, and places that intimation among the
</p>
<p>vain and empty imaginings of the author. And the very
</p>
<p>erection of an independent state ; that he expected to leave this place
</p>
<p>the 1st of August, and that he would arrive in time to inform and aid
</p>
<p>what he had discussed with me, for he deems it a very fit and impor-
</p>
<p>tant subject for consideration, and for the present he thanked me for
</p>
<p>himself and in the name of all the country, which would be under last-
</p>
<p>ing obligation to me. This, your Excellency, is another element of this
</p>
<p>arduous business, in which I believe that now more than ever it be-
</p>
<p>hooves us to take occasion to make sure for ourselves without incurring
</p>
<p>resentment of others. I beg that your Excellency will condescend to
</p>
<p>inform me if this has the approbation of his majesty, and that the ele-
</p>
<p>vated understanding of your Excellency will direct me, so that if any
</p>
<p>sudden occasion should occur 1 may meet it effectively and without
</p>
<p>clash, which I confess seems difficult. Your Excellency is aware that
</p>
<p>the power his majesty has designed to confer on me mentions the
</p>
<p>'United States,' and will serve to direct me if occasion offers to do any
</p>
<p>thing within its scope.
</p>
<p>" I think we need not be disturbed by the English intrigues for ob-
</p>
<p>taining the friendship of that District, because its inhabitants well know
</p>
<p>how infinitely important to them is communication and friendship with
</p>
<p>their neighbors of the Lower River who have that which they need,
</p>
<p>and the port which naturally pertains to their country.

</p>
<p>see me before he departs, and I will not lose an opportunity of for-

<p>letters* of Madison which he cites, but does not quote, for
</p>
<p>his bold assertion that Gardoqui had " quite clearly
</p>
<p>broached a proposition that Kentucky should be aban-
</p>
<p>doned to Spain," to Madison ; and that Gardoqui " had
</p>
<p>conversations of similar import " with Madison and Mon-
</p>
<p>* In a note at the bottom of page 14 of the Centennial Address, Col-
</p>
<p>onel Brown says: "Madison, under date 19th of March, 1787, writes
</p>
<p>very fully to Jefferson concerning the agitation existing in the western
</p>
<p>country, and Gardoqui's plan of offering right of navigation, if Kentucky
</p>
<p>would join Spain. (The Madison Papers, vol. 2, page 622)." There is
</p>
<p>not a Hne nor a word in the letter cited to furnish the shadow of a war-
</p>
<p>rant for Colonel Brown's statement. Mr. ]\Iadison informed Jefferson
</p>
<p>that "A late accidental conversation with Gardoqui proved to me that
</p>
<p>the negotiation (Jay's) is arrested." . . . '' But although it appears that the
</p>
<p>intended sacrifice will not be made, the consequences of the intention and
</p>
<p>the attempt are likely to be very serious." ... "I have credible infor-
</p>
<p>mation that the people living on the Western waters are already in
</p>
<p>great agitation, and are taking measures for uniting their consultations.
</p>
<p>{This had reference to the movement of the Committee of Western
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, and anticipated the circular of Brown, Innes, Sebastian
</p>
<p>and Muter.) The ambition of individuals will quickly mix itself vnth the
</p>
<p>original motives of resentment and interest. (Madison seems to have under-
</p>
<p>stood human nature, and to have anticipated its operations upon John
</p>
<p>Brown, Hary Innes and Benjamin Sebastian.) Communications will
</p>
<p>gradually take place with their British neighbors. They will be led to set
</p>
<p>up) for themselves (that was what Hary Innes threatened to do in his letter
</p>
<p>to Governor Randolph) to seize on the vacant lands, to entice emigrants
</p>
<p>by bounties and an exemption from federal burdens, and in all respects
</p>
<p>play the part of Vermont on a large theatre. It is hinted to me that
</p>
<p>British partisans are already feeling the pulse of some of the western
</p>
<p>settlements. Should those apprehensions not be imaginary, Spain may
</p>
<p>have equal cause with the United States to rue this unnatural attempt
</p>
<p>to shut the Mississippi. Gardoqui has been admonished of the danger
</p>
<p>and, I believe, is not insensible to it, though he affects to be otherwise,

</p>
<p>his court would induce her to play into the hands of Spain." This is
</p>
<p>the only mention made of Gardoqui in the letter, and from the begin-
</p>
<p>ning to the end of it the name of Kentucky is not mentioned, nor is
</p>
<p>there a single expression from the beginning to the end of the letter
</p>
<p>which can be construed as alluding to Kentucky other than those
</p>
<p>contained in these quotations. It contains not one word which could
</p>
<p>possibly have suggested to Colonel Brown that Gardoqui had proposed
</p>
<p>to Madison a "plan of offering right of navigation if Kentucky ivould join
</p>
<p>Spain." That plan was never proposed nor suggested by Gardoqui to
</p>
<p>Madison. He did formally and officially propose it to John Brown, a

<p>year later, and John Brown promised to " aid " in promoting that plan.

<p>Brown's positive and most venturesome allegation, that

<p>had informed Mr. Madisou of Gardoqui's proposition when

<p>have had no faith in his own argument that Madison was
</p>
<p>present at and participated in the conference,  the very
</p>
<p>nature of which forbids the thought that Colonel Brown's
</p>
<p>suggestion could be correct.
</p>
<p>The statement made in the " Beginnings," that John
</p>
<p>164 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Brown, after his conference with Gardoqui, " now knew
</p>
<p>unmistakably from the lips of the Spanish minister that
</p>
<p>nothing but a pretext, such as would evade the complica-
</p>
<p>tions of an old diplomacy, was sought for permitting the
</p>
<p>people of the west to enjoy the natural advantages of
</p>
<p>their geographical position," possesses greater merit for
</p>
<p>its faultless grammatical construction than as a candid re-
</p>
<p>lation of the facts. The official dispatch of Gardoqui,
</p>
<p>which appears in the " Beginnings," and the official com-
</p>
<p>munications of Navarro and Miro to their court, which
</p>
<p>are excluded therefrom, unfortunately combine to prove
</p>
<p>that the reference to the " old diplomacy," as a reason why
</p>
<p>the right of navigating the Mississippi from its source to
</p>
<p>its mouth which Great Britain had acquired in 1763, and
</p>
<p>which the United States had acquired by the reyolution,
</p>
<p>could not be conceded to them, was the "pretext; " while
</p>
<p>the real aim of the Spaniards, Diplomats and Intendant,
</p>
<p>was to divide the Union, and that the Mississippi was the
</p>
<p>means by which they sought to tempt or drive Kentuck-
</p>
<p>ians to disloyalty. When this purpose was disclosed to
</p>
<p>John Brown by Gardoqui, it appears from the dispatch of
</p>
<p>the latter, that Mr. Brown deemed the matter " fit for con-
</p>
<p>sideration," and promised to " aid " in what had been pro-
</p>
<p>posed to him.
</p>
<p>The " Beginnings" continues : "It was now deiinitely
</p>
<p>admitted that trade through the Mississippi would be
</p>
<p>' winked at ' until a formal international treaty could be
</p>
<p>concluded, if only some excuse like the declaration of a new
</p>
<p>state could be presented as a palliative to Spanish pride of
</p>
<p>opinion." But the facts with which Colonel Brown was
</p>
<p>familiar show, that Spain had refused, and at that very
</p>
<p>time continued to persistently refuse, to make any treaty
</p>
<p>with the United States which admitted even by implica-
</p>
<p>tion their right to that navigation, or one which did not

</p>
<p>case of a treaty (which should abandon our right to the
</p>
<p>navigation) trade through the Mississippi and other chan-
</p>
<p>nels would be winked at," was in a conversation with Mr.

<p>to John Brown, and was not one by which he or his court

<p>of Navarro, and of the intrigue with "Wilkinson, he had

</p>
<p>In his secret conference with Gardoqui, as appears from
</p>
<p>the dispatch of the latter to his court, John Brown " ad-
</p>
<p>mitted, in confidence, that he had hy a messenger who
</p>
<p>had left New York some days before, communicated to
</p>
<p>his constituents the decision of Congress concerning the
</p>
<p>separation," and had referred to the proposition made to
</p>
<p>him by Gardoqui. It seems certain that he sent by that
</p>
<p>messenger a number of letters other than the one received
</p>
<p>by Judge Samuel McDowell, but to whom they were
</p>
<p>addressed, or what were the exact terms used in those
</p>
<p>other letters, can not noAv be ascertained. The only letter

</p>
<p>which was not received until the fall of 1788. The one addressed to
</p>
<p>McDowell was received before the 28th of July, 1788, on which day the

</p>
<p>been the stated president of all the previous conventions,
</p>
<p>save that presided over by Fleming, and whom he cor-
</p>
<p>rectly calculated would be chosen to the same position by
</p>
<p>that about to assemble. He expected and intended his
</p>
<p>letter to McDowell to reach that venerable gentleman on
</p>
<p>the eve of the assembling of the convention, which it did;
</p>
<p>and to make certain of this wrote and transmitted it at
</p>
<p>once. He also expected, as he informed Gardoqui, that,
</p>
<p>as an effect of that letter, the convention " would resolve
</p>
<p>upon the erection of an independent state," in defiance of
</p>
<p>the conditions expressed in the act of the assembly and in
</p>
<p>contempt of the decision and advice of Congress. But
</p>
<p>one newspaper was then published in Kentucky, which
</p>
<p>received intelligence of movements on the Atlantic coast
</p>
<p>only after long delays. Their Congressman was the
</p>
<p>medium upon whom the people naturally and necessarily
</p>
<p>depended for correct information of measures affecting
</p>
<p>their interests which were before the body of which he
</p>
<p>was a member. It was manifestly and peculiarly his duty
</p>
<p>to have transmitted to that convention information not
</p>
<p>only of the action of Congress upon their application, but
</p>
<p>the reasons assigned by Congress for that action. But,
</p>
<p>not satisfied with merely suppressing those reasons, " which
</p>
<p>were indisputably sound," and which were so well calcu-
</p>
<p>lated to convince, and conciliate and soothe and assure,
</p>
<p>John Brown substituted therefor reasons of his own, which
</p>
<p>attributed this just action to jealous animosity to the west
</p>
<p>after the action of Congress on July 3d, and the making of a direct
</p>
<p>proposition by Gardoqui, and before the conference described in the
</p>
<p>latter's dispatch. The letter to Muter was dated the 10th of July, 1788,
</p>
<p>was not received until the fall, and was not probably sent by the same
</p>
<p>messenger. Colonel Marshall wrote to Washington that he had read
</p>
<p>"some" of Brown's letters, which referred to more than one. Muter
</p>
<p>wrote that he " knetv that letters similar to that to me had been received

</p>
<p>much earlier, even previous to the sitting of the convention in the
</p>
<p>month of July, of that year, and that a letter, or a part of a letter from
</p>
<p>him was read in convention." This shows beyond doubt that he
</p>
<p>wrote other letters than those addressed to McDowell and Muter. But
</p>
<p>they were suppressed by his friends, and it was denied they were writ-
</p>
<p>ten.

</p>
<p>and to sinister designs, as he afterwards did in the Littell
</p>
<p>pamphlet. The motives he ascribed to Congress were cal-
</p>
<p>cuLated to inflame and exasperate. They were intended
</p>
<p>to precipitate the revolutionary separation from Virginia,
</p>
<p>which he told Gardoqui he expected. By this course
</p>
<p>Kentucky would have heen placed in readiness to embrace
</p>
<p>the proposals made to him by Gardoqui, which he after-
</p>
<p>wards obsequiously thanked the Spaniard for having made.
</p>
<p>The precise terms of that letter to McDowell were never
</p>
<p>made public. In its body no mention was made of Gar-
</p>
<p>doqui's overture. But he contrived a "sliding letter,"
</p>
<p>written on a separate piece of paper, and marked " con-
</p>
<p>fidential," which he inclosed in the other ; and which was
</p>
<p>in these words :
</p>
<p>" In a conversation I had with ISIr. Gardoqui, the Spanish minister,
</p>
<p>relative to the navigation of the Mississippi, he stated that, if the people
</p>
<p>of Kentucky would erect themselves into an independent state, and appoint a
</p>
<p>proper person to negotiate with him, he had an authority for that purpose, and
</p>
<p>would enter into an arrangement with them, for the exportation of their produce
</p>
<p>to New Orleans, on terms of mutual advantage."
</p>
<p>The fundamental condition precedent, annexed by Gar-
</p>
<p>doqui, and understood by Brown, that this " indejjendent
</p>
<p>state " must be separate from and independent of the Union,
</p>
<p>as well as of Virginia, was not disclosed in this letter to
</p>
<p>the stern and vigorous McDowell. It will be perceived
</p>
<p>that, instead of explicitly and precisely stating the condi-
</p>
<p>tions under which Spain was ready to open the Mississippi
</p>
<p>to Kentucky, in this letter to Colonel McDowell the pru-
</p>
<p>dent Mr. Brown left a b#idge over which to retreat in
</p>
<p>case McDowell should repel the proposition of disunion.
</p>
<p>That bridge was to have been the same paltry pretense be-
</p>
<p>hind which he sought to shelter himself in the Littell
</p>
<p>pamphlet in 1806: That what was meant by an "inde-
</p>
<p>pendent state " was, a state separate from and independent

</p>
<p>an accomplished master of tlie art of circumlocution, show
</p>
<p>that the same construction is even now sought to be placed
</p>
<p>upon Gardoqui's dispatch.
</p>
<p>With the weak and unstable Muter, who had been so
</p>
<p>greatly under the influence of himself and Innes, and
</p>
<p>under that influence had signed the circular of March 19,
</p>
<p>1787 ;  with Muter, Mr. Brown felt secure in being more
</p>
<p>explicit. The letter to Muter, was dated July 10, 1788,
</p>
<p>and in its lines John Brown himself stands revealed. In
</p>
<p>that letter he alleged, that the majority of the committee
</p>
<p>to which the application of Kentucky and the act of the
</p>
<p>assembly had been referred " could not be prevailed on to
</p>
<p>report a bill for the admission of Kentucky into the
</p>
<p>Union, because they were opposed to that admission.'" At the
</p>
<p>same time he sujypressed the unanswerable reasons assigned
</p>
<p>by Congress why they had ceased to have any rightful
</p>
<p>authority to grant the request, and for referring the ap-
</p>
<p>plication to the new government which had then been
</p>
<p>established; and suppressed also all the conciliatory ex-
</p>
<p>pressions in favor of admitting Kentucky into the. new
</p>
<p>Union, and the cordial and hearty advice that the district
</p>
<p>should get all things in readiness to be received into that
</p>
<p>new Union at the earliest practical moment. He referred
</p>
<p>to the refusal to receive Kentucky as if it had been the
</p>
<p>action of the " Eastern States " only ; assigned as their
</p>
<p>reason, that Vermont or Maine was not brought forward
</p>
<p>at the same time, and expressed the opinion that the
</p>
<p>eastern states never would assent to the admission of Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky except in that contingency ; emphatically affirmed,
</p>
<p>that " the jealousy of the growing importance of the western
</p>
<p>country, and an unwillingness to add a vote to the southern
</p>
<p>interest are the real causes of opposition " and wound up with
</p>
<p>the assertion that these causes would " continue to exist" to
</p>
<p>a certain extent even under the new government. To give

</p>
<p>consistency to these animadversions upon the motives of
</p>
<p>the eastern states, to whose jealousy and ill will he
</p>
<p>ascribed the action, he carefully suppressed the fact that
</p>
<p>the delegates of every southern state present, except those
</p>
<p>of Virginia, had unanimously voted to postpone the bill
</p>
<p>170 The Spaiiish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>in order to take up Dane's substitute ; and that the dele-
</p>
<p>gates from Virginia, saving himself alone, had then joined
</p>
<p>with the other southern states in passing the substitute
</p>
<p>itself! As presented by Mr. Brown, the situation for
</p>
<p>Kentucky was, indeed, gloomy.
</p>
<p>After this dismal outlook had been set forth, Mr. Brown
</p>
<p>proceeded to say that, the question then presented to the
</p>
<p>district was, whether it would continue its connection with
</p>
<p>Virginia, " or to declare its independence and proceed to
</p>
<p>form a- constitution of government ; " to abide by the law,
</p>
<p>obtain a new act of the assembly, and apply for admission
</p>
<p>into the new Union, or to act without law, resort to revo-
</p>
<p>lution, and assume sovereignty, which would not only
</p>
<p>separate them from Virginia, but would leave them with-
</p>
<p>out other political bonds. '"Tis generally expected," he
</p>
<p>wrote, " that the latter will be the determination, as you
</p>
<p>have proceeded too far to think of relinquishing the
</p>
<p>measure, and the interest of the district will render it
</p>
<p>altogether inexpedient to continue in your present situa-
</p>
<p>tion until an application for admission into the Union can
</p>
<p>be made in a constitutional mode, to the new govern-
</p>
<p>ment." More urgent advice could not have been given
</p>
<p>them to do what he had told Gardoqui he expected them
</p>
<p>to do ; and which would have been the first step necessary
</p>
<p>in the plan he had promised Gardoqui to return home and
</p>
<p>" aid." " This step," he continued, " will, in my opinion,
</p>
<p>tend to preserve unanimity, and will enable you to adopt
</p>
<p>with effect such measures as may he necessary to 2>romote the
</p>
<p>interests of the district." Viewed in the light cast upon it
</p>
<p>by the dispatch of Gardoqui and the statement of Pollock
</p>
<p>to Miro, what were the " measures " this declaration of
</p>
<p>independence and assumption of sovereignty would have
</p>
<p>enabled them to " adopt," and what was the nature ot the

<p>''Dear Sir :  An answer to your favour of the 16th of March was to-
</p>
<p>gether with several other letters, put into the hands of one of General
</p>
<p>Harmar's officers, who set out in May last for the Ohio, and who prom-
</p>
<p>ised to forward them to the district ; but I fear that they have miscar-
</p>
<p>ried, as I was a few' days ago informed that his orders had been counter-
</p>
<p>manded, and that he had been sent to the garrison at West Point.
</p>
<p>" Indeed I have found it almost impracticable to transmit a letter to
</p>
<p>Kentucky, as there is scarce any communication between this place and
</p>
<p>that country. A post is now established from this place to fort Pitt, to
</p>
<p>set out once in two weeks, after the 20th inst., this will render the com-
</p>
<p>munication easj^ and certain. Before this reaches you, I expect you
</p>
<p>will have heard the determination of Congress relative to the separa-
</p>
<p>tion of Kentucky, as a copy of the proceedings has been forwarded to

<p>the district by the secretary of Congress a few days ago.

<p>into the union, as an independent state, unless Vermont, or the prov-

<p>believe that they will exist to a certain degree even under the new govern-

<p>enable you to adopt with effect such measures as may be necessary to promote the

</p>
<p>doqui, the Spanish minister, at this place, I have been assured by him in the
</p>
<p>most explicit terms, that if Kentucky will declare her independence

<p>OF THE United States, by reason of commercial treaties existing be-

<p>tween that court and other powers of Europe. As there is no reason to
</p>
<p>doubt the sincerity of this declaration, I have thought proper to com-
</p>
<p>municate it to a few confidential friends in the district, with his permis-
</p>
<p>sion, not doubting but that they will make a prudent use of the infor-
</p>
<p>mation which is in part confirmed by dispatches yesterday received by
</p>
<p>Congress from Mr. Carmichael, our minister at that court, the contents

<p>to meet in February ; but it may undergo alterations. Ten states have

<p>Kentucky would have been had Mr. Brown's advice been
</p>
<p>heeded or had his wishes prevailed. For there is no one
</p>
<p>so simple as to believe that the man who thus communi-
</p>
<p>cated the proposals of Spain, 2vith the permission of her
</p>
<p>minister, did so only to those whom he supposed would
</p>
<p>reject the offers ; nor can it be credited that the man who
</p>
<p>thus urged others to take the first step necessary in the
</p>
<p>programme, in order that Kentucky might be in a posi-
</p>
<p>tion to " adopt such measures as may be necessary to pro-
</p>
<p>mote the interest of the district," by securing the privilege
</p>
<p>of navigating the Mississippi, was not himself in favor of
</p>
<p>all the other measures necessary to promote that interest
</p>
<p>and to secure the tempting prize extended in the Span-
</p>
<p>iard's seducing hand.
</p>
<p>Muter did not receive this letter until the fall of the
</p>
<p>year in which it was written. Its nature and the peculiar
</p>
<p>circumstances of the public situation rendered it inexpe-
</p>
<p>dient to give it general publicity. In his perplexity and
</p>
<p>anxiety, however, he exhibited it to Colonel Thomas Mar-
</p>
<p>shall, whose neighbor he had become on removing from
</p>
<p>Danville to what was then Fayette, and is now Woodford-
</p>
<p>county. At the time he exhibited it to no one else, but spoke
</p>
<p>of its contents to such men as Colonel Crockett, Colonel
</p>
<p>John Allen, and Colonel Edwards. * When the letter
</p>
<p>* James Markham Marshall having publistied an extract from Brown's
</p>
<p>letter to Muter, which he had obtained from the latter for publication,
</p>
<p>Muter addressed to the Lexington Gazette a letter in which he explained
</p>
<p>the circumstances under which he had consented to the publication.
</p>
<p>This letter was published in the Gazette on the 4th of September, 1 790.
</p>
<p>It was republished in the Westerri World, in the Palladium and in the
</p>
<p>Gazatte, in September, 1806. After briefly stating the publication which
</p>
<p>had been made by James M. Marshall, and his own unwillingness to be
</p>
<p>understood as having been actuated by a desire to injure John Brown
</p>
<p>in consenting to the publication, Muter wrote, viz :

<p>" It has always been a fixed principle with me that a private or con-
</p>
<p>fidential letter ought not to be communicated to any person whatever ;
</p>
<p>but, this extends not to cases where, I think, the public intered and safety
</p>
<p>may be concerned ; in such cases my duty as a citizen with me supercedes
</p>
<p>every other consideration.
</p>
<p>Mr. Browns letter to me came to hand in tlie fall of 17S8, and I knew that
</p>
<p>letters from him, similar to that to me had been received mucii earlier,
</p>
<p>174 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>was received by Muter, James Markliam, the third son of
</p>
<p>Colonel Thomas Marshall, had not come into the district.
</p>
<p>even previous to the sitting of the convention in the month of July of
</p>
<p>that year ; and that a letter or a part of a letter from him was read in
</p>
<p>convention. When a total separation was in contemplation, I was of opinion
</p>
<p>that Mr. Brown's letter had weight in the convention in inducing people to think
</p>
<p>such a measure was right. That, however, was a measure I was warmly
</p>
<p>opposed to ; and therefore I considered it my indispensable duty to do
</p>
<p>every thing in my power to prevent it from taking place ; and for that
</p>
<p>purpose, as I knew Colonel Marshall thought as I did vith respect to it, I showed
</p>
<p>the letter to him, and consulted with him as to the steps it M^as neces-
</p>
<p>sary to take to effect the purpose both of us had in view, and withal to
</p>
<p>bring it about."
</p>
<p>[In republishing an extract from this letter of Muter, Littell, in his
</p>
<p>defense of Brown and Innes, in 1806, omitted the foregoing, which
</p>
<p>made disclosures it was desired to conceal. But what follows was pub-
</p>
<p>lished in Littell's " Narrative," viz :]
</p>
<p>" As a letter from Mr. Brown had been read in the convention (that
</p>
<p>of July, 1788,), (though, as I was not a member, I did not know certainly,
</p>
<p>whether the whole or a part only had been read, or whether it had, as
</p>
<p>is customary, lain on the table for the inspection and consideration of
</p>
<p>the members,) I conceived it to be no breach of confidence to show his
</p>
<p>(Brown's) letter to me, to Colonel Marshall, or to speak of it when it
</p>
<p>.became the subject of conversation, even if the principle mentioned
</p>
<p>above, had been entirely out of the question. Soon after Mr. James Mar-
</p>
<p>shall's arrival in the district, he told me he had been informed I had re-
</p>
<p>ceived a letter from Mr. Brown, containing matters of public concern,
</p>
<p>mentioned a part of the contents and expressed a wish to see it. I did
</p>
<p>show it to him, because I thought it better that he should form his
</p>
<p>opinion of its contents from what he read himself, than that he should
</p>
<p>judge of them from what was repeated to him from memory, where
</p>
<p>possibly there might be some mistake that might mislead him. After
</p>
<p>this, when I supposed the business of a total separation to be quite at an end,
</p>
<p>I never showed the letter to any person whatever ; and I even avoided

</p>
<p>as much as possible, making it the subject of conversation."
</p>
<p>The letter then went on to tell the circumstances of the duel between
</p>
<p>Brown and Marshall which had been on the tapis. " When I was in
</p>
<p>Mercer in July last, I was told by two gentlemen at different times, that
</p>
<p>Mr. Marshall, when questioned by Mr. James Brown, with respect to his
</p>
<p>having spoken to the injury of his brother's character, he said that he
</p>
<p>partly formed his opinion of his brother's conduct from what was con-
</p>
<p>tained in the letter above alluded to. ... I had not, however, be-
</p>
<p>fore I received the information above mentioned, ever heard that Mr.
</p>
<p>Marshall had reflected on Mr. Brown's conduct, from the time he be-
</p>
<p>came a candidate. A few days before I set off for Fayette August
</p>
<p>Court, Mr. Marshall came to my house, and requested that I would fur-
</p>
<p>nish him with Mr. Brown's letter to me, or that I would carry it to
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 175
</p>
<p>But soon after he did come into it he spoke of the letter
</p>
<p>to Muter, manifested his knowledge of a part of its con-
</p>
<p>Lexington. I told him I would carry it with me, and accordingly did so.
</p>
<p>When I got to Lexington I found it to be the common talk of the town,
</p>
<p>that a duel was to be fouglit, between Mr. Marshall and Mr. (James)
</p>
<p>Brown. On Wednesday forenoon Mr. Marshall applied to me for the
</p>
<p>letter. I refused to give it to him, but told him I would attend at any
</p>
<p>time and place to produce it, if necessary. He answered that, that
</p>
<p>probably would not do, because when he wanted to make use of the
</p>
<p>letter, there might be neither time nor opportunity to send for me ; I
</p>
<p>told him then that I would give him an extract from the letter, which I
</p>
<p>should accompany with my reasons for giving the extract, and for ever
</p>
<p>showing the letter at all. I was anxious to prevent a duel from taking
</p>
<p>place ; and particularly so to do every thing in my power for that pur-
</p>
<p>l)0se, without publicly appearing in the business; and from circum-
</p>
<p>stances I was led to believe, that, an accommodation, might probably
</p>
<p>take place and that the production of the letter or an extract from it
</p>
<p>might lead to it. I, therefore, fui-nished Mr. Marshall with an extract
</p>
<p>from the letter, accompanied with a statement of my reasons for doing
</p>
<p>so, and restricted him to show it to Mr. Brown only, or to one or two
</p>
<p>more gentlemen, with his approbation. I left town on Tuesday. On
</p>
<p>the Friday evening following, Mr. Marshall came to my house, and re-
</p>
<p>quested that, I would consent to the publication of the extract in his
</p>
<p>possession. I told him I was averse to doing so, because T did not wish to
</p>
<p>injure Mr. (John) Brown, nor even to appear in the business at all. He
</p>
<p>urged, that he had been accused of telling a falsity, and that he had no
</p>
<p>other way, as matters stood, of vindicating his character from a charge
</p>
<p>so injurious to it. I told him then that I would give him an answer in
</p>
<p>the morning. In the morning I told him, I wished and hoped the busi-
</p>
<p>ness could be done without the publication he requested, and that I was
</p>
<p>willing to come forward when properly called upon and disclose every
</p>
<p>thing in my power ; but on his urging that, as the matter was now be-
</p>
<p>come public, nothing but the publication could vindicate his character,
</p>
<p>with respect to his having told a falsehood concerning the letter, I con-
</p>

</p>
<p>sented that in case of absolute necessity, he might publish the piece
</p>
<p>I had furnished him with, in which the extract was contained ; but that
</p>
<p>he must publish the whole if he published at all."
</p>
<p>As this explanation of Muter was published in 1790, before the estab-
</p>
<p>lishment of Kentucky as a state, and while the matter of a separation
</p>
<p>from Virginia tuas still pending, the reader will perceive that the ex-
</p>
<p>pression : ' After this, when I supposed the business of a total separation to
</p>
<p>be quite at an end " could only have referred to the business of a separation
</p>
<p>from the Union as well as from Virginia. It exhibits, beyond question,
</p>
<p>Muter's construction of Brown's letter, and of the business to which it
</p>
<p>related, and which he had, with Colonel Marshall, been a main factor
</p>
<p>in defeating. His solicitude for Brown's reputation is apparent in his
</p>
<p>176 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>tents, and requested to see the letter itself. Deeming it
</p>
<p>better that the younger Marshall might form his opinion
</p>
<p>from a personal inspection rather than from hearsay,
</p>
<p>Muter complied with his request. In 1790, James Mark-
</p>
<p>liam Marshall, then a young man of twenty-six, became a
</p>
<p>candidate for Congress against John Brown, the incum-
</p>
<p>bent, and during the canvass he charged Brown, (who
</p>
<p>was at the time in New York), Wilkinson and others, with
</p>
<p>liaving conspired to illegally separate Kentucky from Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia and the Union, and then, as an independent state, to
</p>
<p>form an alliance with Spain. Violent exception to this
</p>
<p>was taken by James Brown, the younger, bolder, more
</p>
<p>talented, and far more amiable and lovable brother of his
</p>
<p>antagonist. In reply to the demands of the latter for the
</p>
<p>grounds of this accusation, James Markham Marshall re-
</p>
<p>ferred to John Brown's letter to Muter as the circumstance
</p>
<p>on which he had mainly formed his opinion and based his
</p>
<p>charge ; and he then described its contents. By fiercely
</p>
<p>denouncing and vehemently denying Marshall's statement,
</p>
<p>that his brother had written such a letter, James Brown,
</p>
<p>by plain implication, conceded that if Marshall's premises
</p>
<p>were correct his conclusion was sound. But the issue of
</p>
<p>veracity made by Brown gave rise to a bitter controversy
</p>
<p>which culminated in an arrangement for a duel  which
</p>
<p>was never fought. Marshall's persistent demands that the
</p>
<p>letter should be made public as the only means then left
</p>
<p>of establishing the truth of what he had said, which had
</p>
<p>been impeached by James Brown, finally secured the con-
</p>
<p>sent of Muter to the publication of an extract therefrom,
</p>
<p>which was made in the Lexington Gazettem August, 1790.
</p>
<p>Its contents gave to the younger Marshall the public and
</p>
<p>triumphant vindication that he desired.
</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that no demand for the publication of
</p>
<p>the lettei" itself, to show that its contents were not as rep-
</p>
<p>gloss.

<p>grandson of John Brown, while denouncing Muter as

<p>"incurring the contempt of violated conlidence" in giv-
</p>
<p>ing the letter " to Marshall as material for a political cam-
</p>
<p>paign," (wliich is not correct) concealed from the public
</p>
<p>the circumstances that made the publication at once justi-
</p>
<p>fiable and necessary.* When, in the controversy which
</p>
<p>broke out in 1806, the letter was desired for publication
</p>
<p>by those who had revived the charges made by James M.
</p>
<p>Marshall, the issues of the Lexington Gazette for the whole
</p>
<p>period covering the publication of the letter, the contro-
</p>
<p>versy between James Brown and James M. Marshall, and
</p>
<p>the pending duel between them, in 1790, were found to
</p>
<p>be conveniently missing from the files of the paper.f
</p>
<p>The only copy of the Gazette containing the letter
</p>
<p>then known to be in existence was in the possession of
</p>
<p>Alexander Scott Bullitt. However, the "Western World
</p>
<p>w^orried and hectored poor Muter, until he republished it in
</p>
<p>the Palladium, in 1806, together with a letter he had pub-
</p>
<p>lished in 1790, which explained the circumstances of his
</p>
<p>having exhibited Brown's letter to Colonel Marshall and
</p>
<p>his furnishing the extract to James M. Marshall, and ac-
</p>
<p>companied both with another letter amplifying that expla-
</p>
<p>nation. Yet John Brown deemed it inexpedient to admit
</p>
<p>his letter to Muter into the pamphlet he had induced and
</p>
<p>paid Littell to write in his defense. The Muter letter was
</p>
<p>excluded from that pamphlet, which nowhere admits, but
</p>
<p>evades, and tries to cover up, the fact that the overture of
</p>
<p>Gardoqui to Brown distinctly contemplated the with-
</p>
<p>drawal of Kentucky from the Union ; and disingenuously
</p>
<p>and deceitfully endeavors to produce the impression, that

<p>concession, was " as unfavorable a*s possible," and the
</p>
<p>creation of prejudice and jealousy.
</p>
<p>The editor of the Western World possessed a glimmering
</p>
<p>of the truth, but was wanting in accurate knowledge of
</p>
<p>details. In one of his earlier editorials, he published an
</p>
<p>erroneous statement concerning the letter of Brown to
</p>
<p>Colonel McDowell. This drew from the latter a card, in
</p>
<p>1806, in which he corrected the error, and gave from mem-
</p>
<p>ory the ipsissima verba of the " sliding letter " he had re-
</p>
<p>ceived from Brown. From it the statement in Brown's
</p>
<p>letter to Muter, which made known and emphasized the
</p>
<p>condition of separation from the Union required by Spain,
</p>
<p>had been carefully omitted by the facile Brown. The let-
</p>
<p>ter to McDowell was the play of Hamlet, with the part of
</p>
<p>the noble Dane left out. So the adroit Mr. Brown pub-
</p>
<p>lished in the Littell pamphlet McDowell's account of the
</p>
<p>"sliding letter" Brown had written to him, and thus
</p>
<p>vouched for its accuracy ; then, suppressing the letter he had
</p>
<p>actually written to Muter, and, protesting that Colonel
</p>
<p>Marshall had given a prejudiced account of that letter, he
</p>
<p>complacently assured the generous and confiding public
</p>
<p>that the letter to Muter " contained the same account of the
</p>
<p>conference with Gardoqui that the letter of Colonel JlcDowell
</p>
<p>did." Exultingly snapping his lingers in the face of his
</p>
<p>adversary, and glorying in this highly intellectual achieve-
</p>
<p>ment, he then and thus dismissed the Muter letter and the
</p>
<p>whole subject of the conference with Gardoqui ; " of this
</p>
<p>conference I trust enough has been said,"
</p>
<p>Had the letter to Muter really been the same as the let-
</p>
<p>ter to McDowell, it would have been published in the
</p>
<p>pamphlet. Because it was not the same, but explicitly
</p>
<p>stated that the privileges of navigating the Mississippi
</p>
<p>would never be granted to Kentucky whilst a part of the
</p>
<p>Union, the trick was resorted to of suppressing it, pub-

<p>lishing the " sliding letter " to McDowell which did not
</p>
<p>contain that statement, and of falsely pretending that the
</p>
<p>accounts of the conference with Gardoqui given in the
</p>
<p>two letters were identical. As Hary Innes published in
</p>
<p>that pamphlet a pretended copy of his letter to Randolph
</p>
<p>The Spanish Consjnracy. 179
</p>
<p>from which he omitted the inconvenient words " Revolt
</p>
<p>from the Union," which were in the original;  so John
</p>
<p>Brown published therein the card of McDowell, which
</p>
<p>did not contain the words, " But that this privilege can
</p>
<p>never be extended to them while part of the United States"
</p>
<p>which was in the Muter letter, and asserted that the ac-
</p>
<p>counts given in the two letters were the same. These
</p>
<p>sujjpressions were not accidental ; probably suggested by
</p>
<p>Brown, they were concerted between the friends, and had
</p>
<p>a common object. The grandson of Brown discovered the
</p>
<p>manipulations, understood their nature, evidently admired,

<p>and certainly imitated them. If this incident has no other

<p>historic value, it is most significant as illustrating the

</p>
<p>Before, but on the eve of the assembling of the con-
</p>
<p>vention, at Danville, on the 28th of July, 1788, Colonel
</p>
<p>Samuel McDowell, the stated president of all these several
</p>
<p>conventions, received the official notification of the action
</p>
<p>of Congress on the application of the district, which had
</p>
<p>been forAvarded by that body. At the same time, and
</p>
<p>most probably by the same messenger, he received the
</p>
<p>letter of John BroA\^n, which ascribed that action to un-
</p>
<p>Avorthy and hostile motives ; inclosed in which Avas the
</p>
<p>" diding letter,''' Avritten on a detached piece of paper and
</p>
<p>marked " confidential," Avhich only partially stated the
</p>
<p>proposition of Gardoqui. !N"o quorum having assembled
</p>
<p>on the first day, the oflEicial paper Avas not communicated
</p>
<p>to the convention until the 29th. The non-confidential
</p>
<p>letter of Brown to Colonel McDowell was .then also read.
</p>
<p>But the "confidential" " sliding letter " concerning the
</p>
<p>conference Avith Gardoqui Avas not read in the convention,
</p>
<p>nor was it exhibited by McDoaa^cU to any one but Innes,*
</p>
<p>* In the case of Innes v. Marshall, Colonel McDowell's deposition was
</p>
<p>taken in behalf of Innes, who propounded this interrogatory to the wit-
</p>
<p>ness:

<p>at the time such vote was taken ?"

</p>
<p>nor spoken of by him during the convention to any other
</p>
<p>human being, Innes had been previously informed by
</p>
<p>"Wilkinson of his arrangement with Miro for the separa-
</p>
<p>tion of Kentucky from the Union, and had entered heart-
</p>
<p>ily into the scheme, as stated in the letter already quoted
</p>
<p>from Wilkinson to Miro. He thus understood at once
</p>
<p>the full and true nature of the Gardoqui overture, which
</p>
<p>was but imperfectly disclosed in the " sliding letter " to
</p>
<p>McDowell, and naturally associated it with the scheme of
</p>
<p>Wilkinson. Delighted, he exclaimed to McDowell : "It
</p>
<p>will do, it will do," and forthwith proceeded to impart the
</p>
<p>contents of the coniidential " sliding letter " to those whom
</p>
<p>he supposed could be trusted.*
</p>
<p>That a feeling of keen disappointment pervaded the
</p>
<p>entire convention was but natural. That this should be
</p>
<p>greatl}^ aggravated by John Brown's letter, ascribing the
</p>
<p>To this McDowell replied :
</p>
<p>"Answer: I never showed it to any other person than the plaintiff
</p>
<p>during the sitting of that convention, that I recollect, or spoke of it to
</p>
<p>any other person during that convention ; and my reason was, it was
</p>
<p>headed ' confidential.' "
</p>
<p>The answer was a sore disappointment to Innes, as it made it clear
</p>
<p>that, if any other member than himself had any information of the
</p>
<p>" sliding letter," it was given by him, in his efforts to secure immediate
</p>
<p>action cutting off from Virginia, and placing Kentucky out of the
</p>
<p>Union. Colonel John Mason Brown found it convenient and advisable
</p>
<p>to exclude this question and answer from the " Political Beginnings."
</p>
<p>* In the examination of ^McDowell, the defendant put the following
</p>
<p>question to him .
</p>
<p>" Question : Aboiit the time of the convention (of July) aforesaid
</p>
<p>sitting in Danville, were you present with the plaintiff, Innes, when the
</p>
<p>subject of erecting Kentucky into an independent state, and placing
</p>
<p>her on the footing with Vermont ;  and did the plaintiff approve of the
</p>
<p>measure, saying :  it will do, it will do : or words to that effect ?"

</p>
<p>"Answer: About the time alluded to, upon showing the plaintiff",
</p>
<p>Innes, the paper enclosed in Mr. Brown's letter, he said: it will do, it
</p>
<p>will do  and an allusion was made to Vermont, which would be the
</p>
<p>one with respect to Kentucky if erected into an independent state."
</p>
<p>This testimony shows the idea entertained by McDowell. But John
</p>
<p>Brown knew from Gardoqui that the proposition was to separate Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky absolutely from the Union, and form an alliance with Spain ; and
</p>
<p>while it was not declared in the " sliding letter," and that to Muter had
</p>
<p>not then been received, Innes knew from Wilkinson what the real pur-
</p>
<p>pose was.
</p>
<p>182 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>action of Congress to hostile motives, was exactly what
</p>
<p>he bad calculated and the object for which be had writ-
</p>
<p>ten. In the convention of 1786-7, when the news of the
</p>
<p>new act of separation was received, in spite of efforts to
</p>
<p>inflame which were made by some, " the momentary vexa-
</p>
<p>tion yielded to a sense of duty and a love of peace." But
</p>
<p>in this of July, 1788, in which Wilkinson was ceaselessly
</p>
<p>active in the discharge of his engagement with Miro, and
</p>
<p>John Brown, though absent in person, was present in the
</p>
<p>effect of his letters misrepresenting the motives of Con-
</p>
<p>gress, " there were," according to Marshall, " observable
</p>
<p>the most deep-felt vexation, a share of ill temper border-
</p>
<p>ing on disaffection to the legal course of things, and some
</p>
<p>strong symptoms of assuming independent government"
</p>
<p>This was a very moderate and conservative expression of
</p>
<p>the situation, and of the efforts then made to precipitate
</p>
<p>the tirst step in the plan arranged by Wilkinson with
</p>
<p>Miro, and which John Brown had promised G-ardoqui to
</p>
<p>return home and " aid." The navigation of the Missis-
</p>
<p>sippi was pressed into the argument " in favor of complet-
</p>
<p>ing the constitution and organizing government without
</p>
<p>delay." And all the time Wilkinson was there, dropping
</p>
<p>obscure hints that the commerce which Congress could
</p>
<p>not secure was awaiting Kentucky if she would only
</p>
<p>stretch forth her hand to take it ; and, as it is certain that
</p>
<p>the contents of the "sliding letter" were also known at
</p>
<p>least to the faithful, one can readily conceive the activity
</p>
<p>of Junes. It was clearly understood by all, that every legal
</p>
<p>power of the convention to frame a constitution or to or-
</p>
<p>ganize government had termiiuited by the ftiilure of the
</p>
<p>conditions expressed in the law itself. And that this was
</p>
<p>fully comprehended by those who most zealously favored
</p>
<p>a resort to revolution could not be more plainly demon-
</p>
<p>strated than it was on the face of this resolution, which

</p>
<p>was proposed :
</p>
<p>" A resolution, declaring that the powers of this convention so far as
</p>
<p>depends on the acts of the legislature of Virginia were annulled by the
</p>
<p>Resolutions of Congress, and resolving that it was the duty of this con-
</p>
<p>vention as the representatives of the people to proceed to frame a con-

<p>stitution of government for this district, and to submit the same to their

<p>consideration \A-ith siicli advice relative thereto as emergency suggests,
</p>
<p>was read.
</p>
<p>Ordered ttiat the said resokition he committed to a committee of the
</p>
<p>whole convention."
</p>
<p>The official report of tlie proceedings of the convention,
</p>
<p>by Thomas Todd does not give the name of the author of
</p>
<p>this resokition. But during the controversies of 1806, it
</p>
<p>was attributed by some to Caleb Wallace, while others al-
</p>
<p>leged that it was offered by Wilkinson and seconded by
</p>
<p>Wallace. The testimony of Governor Greenup in the case
</p>
<p>of Lines v. Marshall is confirmatory of those who attrib-
</p>
<p>uted it to Wallace. * It was moved by one and seconded
</p>
<p> In that case the following questions were propounded to and an-
</p>
<p>swers given by Greenup, who was a witness for Innes, viz :
</p>
<p>"6th: Did you in July, 1788, hear a motion made and advocated by
</p>
<p>either James Wilkinson, Caleb Wallace, Benjamin Sebastian, or the
</p>
<p>plaintiff, to separate the district of Kentucky from the State of Virginia
</p>
<p>and the United States, and form a connexion with the Spanish govern-
</p>
<p>ment ?
</p>
<p>" Answer: T did not hear such a motion from any person.
</p>
<p>"7th: Did you in the convention of November, 1788, hear such a
</p>
<p>proposition as stated in the preceding interrogatory made and advocated
</p>
<p>by either of the above named persons or John Brown, who was then
</p>
<p>also a member ?
</p>
<p>" Answer : I did not. I think Mr. Wallace submitted a resolution for
</p>
<p>proceeding to frame a constitution and submitting it to Congress, with-
</p>
<p>out applying again to the State of Virginia, observing that she had al-
</p>
<p>ready given her assent to the measure and it would save time, but it
</p>
<p>was overruled."
</p>
<p>The question related to a resolution embracing, in direct terms, three
</p>
<p>propositions: violent separation from Virginia; withdrawal from the
</p>
<p>Union ; and a connection with Spain. Humphrey Marshall certainly had
</p>
<p>never stated that a resolution in those terms had ever been presented by
</p>
<p>the men named or anyone else. While Greenup denied, and truthfully

</p>
<p>denied, that a resolution in those terms had been offered, he was honest
</p>
<p>enough to admit that one had been presented for separating from Virginia
</p>
<p>and assuming sovereignty, contrary to the act of the assembly and without
</p>
<p>another application to Virginia, and he was possibly correct in naming
</p>
<p>Wallace as its author. He was mistaken, however, as to the time when
</p>
<p>the resolution was offered by Wilkinson or AVallace, who was a member
</p>
<p>of the July convention, w"hen it was presented, and w'as not a member
</p>
<p>of that of November. His recollection was also at fault concerning the
</p>
<p>Urim of the resolution, which contained no suggestion to " submit the con-
</p>
<p>stitution to Congress." And he was probably equally at fault in regard to
</p>
<p>the remarks made bv Wallace in that connection.
</p>
<p>184 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>by the other and was advocated by both. It was a propo-
</p>
<p>sition to violently separate from Virginia, and to assume
</p>
<p>independence and sovereignty, as had been urged by Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson in 1786. Its adoption, had it possessed validity,
</p>
<p>and could it have been carried into eft'ect, would have
</p>
<p>separated Kentucky from Virginia and from the Confed-
</p>
<p>eration, without connecting her with the new Union,
</p>
<p>would have left her free to form alliances where she chose,
</p>
<p>and would almost necessarily liave placed her in antago-
</p>
<p>nism with Virginia and the Union. Sebastian and Innes,
</p>
<p>to whom his arrangement with Miro had been communi-
</p>
<p>cated by Wilkinson, and Wilkinson himself, acted in con-
</p>
<p>cert with Wallace in endeavoring to procure the passage
</p>
<p>of this resolution ;*  a fact which indicates what it was
</p>
<p>hoped the passage of the resolution would accomplish.
</p>
<p>That the construction placed upon the resolution at the
</p>
<p>time by its opponents was, that it was intended to separate
</p>
<p>Kentucky not only from Virginia, but also from the
</p>
<p>United States; and that it was combatted on that ground,
</p>
<p>is conclusively proved by the oath of Judge John Allen,
</p>
<p>of Bourbon, who was one of the purest men and ablest
</p>
<p>lawyers of that day in the district, f The testimony of
</p>
<p>Judge Allen was corroborated by that of James French, a
</p>
<p>delegate from Madison, who, while he could not recollect
</p>
<p>" that any member directly advocated a separation from
</p>
<p>the United States," [it was not good policy to do that],
</p>
<p>yet did recall that " the tenor of argument on one side
</p>
<p>was for patience under the privation of the trade of the
</p>
<p>* Judge John Allen, of Bourbon, testified, in the case of Lines v.
</p>
<p>Marshall, that he was a member of the convention of July, 1788 ; that,
</p>
<p>" There was a party in the convention of that date who were in tavor of
</p>
<p>creating Kentucky into an independent government, and of organizing
</p>
<p>the same witliout an act of the Virginia assembly or of Congress for that
</p>
<p>purpose, and Colonel Hary Innes was of that party; " and that "Gen-

<p>eral James Wilkinson and Mr. Benjamin Sebastian were members of
</p>
<p>said convention and were both in favor of the separation," as just
</p>
<p>stated.
</p>
<p>t On cross-examination Judge Innes asked Judge Allen the following
</p>
<p>questions and received the following answers, viz :
</p>
<p>" 1st : In answer to the second interrogatory of the defendant, you
</p>
<p>state that there was a party in the convention of July, 17S8, who were
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 185
</p>
<p>Mississippi, and adherence to the United States ; on the
</p>
<p>other, " that it was the design of the United States to re-
</p>
<p>strict the western conntry, and to discourage its growth
</p>
<p>and popuLation, by an interested and partial policy."
</p>
<p>Mr. French stated that " Mr. Innes was a speaker, and
</p>
<p>among those who were declaring against the hostile policy
</p>
<p>of the United States to the western country;"* that the
</p>
<p>course of Innes' " argument was that it was the design of
</p>
<p>the United States, more to curb than to protect the power
</p>
<p>of the western country," and he remembered that at the
</p>
<p>conclusion of one of Innes' speeches he said : " Mr, Presi-
</p>
<p>dent, when I reflect on the treatment of the United States
</p>
<p>to this country, I feel, I can not tell how,  I feel, sir, like
</p>
<p>shedding blood." He was equally explicit as to the utter-
</p>
<p>in favor cf erecting Kentucky into a separate and independent govern-
</p>
<p>ment without obtaining an act from Virginia or from Congress, and that
</p>
<p>the plaintiff was one who composed that party ; name them and state
</p>
<p>wliether tliey or either of them introduced any resolution in convention
</p>
<p>to that efiect ?
</p>
<p>" Answer : General James Wilkinson, Benjamin Sebastian, Harry
</p>
<p>Innes, the plaintiff, Caleb Wallace, a member from Madison by the
</p>
<p>name of Adams, and I believe some others, who are not at this time
</p>
<p>recollected. General Wilkinson was the leader of this party. I can
</p>
<p>not recollect whether any resolution to the effect was offered, but it is
</p>
<p>strongljr impressed on my mind that there was. The convention had
</p>
<p>been in session some days before I arrived there.
</p>
<p>" Question by the same : To what intent did the proposition for a
</p>
<p>separation go, i. e., was it a separation from the United States absolutely,
</p>
<p>or a separation from Virginia only, and then to become a member of the
</p>
<p>Federal Union ?
</p>
<p>"Answer: I understood the proposition then made, fand it has ever
</p>
<p>since been impressed on my mind,) that the separation proposed was to
</p>
<p>erect a government independent of the State of Virginia and of the
</p>
<p>United States."

<p>This deponent thought the proposition, the effect, though not the
</p>
<p>terms, of which was as he stated, was brought forward by General Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson, but stated circumstances tending to show he might have been
</p>
<p>mistaken as to that.
</p>
<p>" Question by the plaintiff: Did the plaintiff take an active part in
</p>
<p>the measure alluded to in the preceding answer ; /. e., did he advocate
</p>
<p>the measure in the convention ?
</p>
<p>Answer : I did consider the plaintiff as one of the principal men who
</p>
<p>advocated the measure, to the best of my recollection ; he did speak on
</p>
<p>the subject.

</p>
<p>ances of Caleb Wallace and Sebastian, as to their indul-
</p>
<p>gence in the fiercest denunciations of the conduct of the
</p>
<p>United States to the west, as to the leadership of Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son, as to the open declarations of George Adams, his
</p>
<p>colleague from Madison, in conversation, in favor of a
</p>
<p>separation from the United States, and that " the proposed
</p>
<p>object of those who were so much displeased with the
</p>
<p>conduct of the United States towards this country, as well
</p>
<p>as he could recollect, ivas to obtain the trade of the Missis-
</p>
<p>sippi  which they alleged was withheld from them by the
</p>
<p>United States; or, at least, that the United States had
</p>
<p>been grossly and intentionally negligent in procuring the
</p>
<p>trade of that river, considered by them as indispensably
</p>
<p>necessary to the welfare of this country." *
</p>
<p>In point of character these men were the equals of any
</p>
<p>other in the convention, and it has never been charged
</p>
<p>that they were the political rivals or personal enemies of
</p>
<p>any of the men whom their testimony condemns. If they
</p>
<p>are worthy of credit it can scarcely be said that the ac-
</p>
<p>count given by Humphrey Marshall of the spirit and pur-
</p>
<p>pose by which Wilkinson, Sebastian, Innes and their fol-
</p>
<p>lowers were actuated, or of their personal utterances, was
</p>
<p>colored by prejudice and malignity.
</p>
<p>But there are not wanting proofs from contemporary
</p>
<p>records that one of the issues raised in this convention
</p>
<p>was that of a separation from the Union. In a communi-
</p>
<p>cation published over the signature " Cornplanter," (Dr.
</p>
<p>Ebenezer Brooks), in the Lexington Gazette, of September
</p>
<p>13, 1788, the proposition is thus distinctly stated : " 2nd.
</p>
<p>Whether a separation from Virginia and unconnected with
</p>
<p>Congress would be advisable." ..." Fourthly, it is urged
</p>
<p>that a separation would speedily 7??'oci<re us the free naviga-
</p>
<p>tion of the Mississippi." ..." When I set down to this
</p>
<p>business I intended to have said a few things on the sub-

<p>ject of assuming a separation independent of Congress,'' etc.

<p>A communication, which is attributed to James Morrison

<p>ill the marginal notes on the file of the same paper, pub-
</p>
<p>lished September 20, 1788, refers to the " ill judged and in-
</p>
<p>temperate pro-position of two or three men in the late convention^''
</p>
<p>and of the " crude reconimendatio7is of that conventioyi," by
</p>
<p>which the proposition of Wilkinson and Wallace, and its
</p>
<p>advocates, were intended. It is seen to be undoubtedly
</p>
<p>true, as stated in Marshall's History and reaffirmed by
</p>
<p>Butler, who wrote in opposition to' Marshall, that the idea
</p>
<p>of disunion "was combatted in the public prints of the
</p>
<p>time," and must have been proposed. Xor is testimony
</p>
<p>wanting from the leader of this party in the July conven-
</p>
<p>tion as to the purposes for which the resolution of Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson and Wallace was proposed and urged. Under
</p>
<p>date of February 12, 1789, General Wilkinson wrote to
</p>
<p>Miro to inform the Intendant of his efforts and their fail-
</p>
<p>ure. Referring to the action of Congress upon the appli-
</p>
<p>cation of the district, he said :
</p>
<p>" From this proceeding of Congress it resulted that the convention
</p>
<p>was of opinion, that our proposed independence and separation from
</p>
<p>Virginia not being ratified, its mission and powers were at an end, and
</p>
<p>we found ourselves in the alternative, either of proceeding to declare
</p>
<p>our independence or of waiting according to the recommendation of
</p>
<p>Congress. This was the state of affairs when the Honorable Caleb
</p>
<p>Wallace, one of our Supreme Judges, the Attorney General Innes, and
</p>
<p>Benjamin Sebastian proposed a prompt separation from the American
</p>
<p>Union, and advocated with intrepidity the necessity of the measure.
</p>
<p>The artifice of Congress was exposed, its proceedings reprobated, the
</p>
<p>consequences of depending on a body whose interests were opposed to ours
</p>
<p>were depicted in the most vivid colors, and the strongest motives were set
</p>
<p>forth to justify the separation." [Gaj^arre, page 226.]
</p>
<p>These " strongest motives " were the inducements held out
</p>
<p>by Spain !  the navigation of the Mississippi, which could
</p>
<p>be had only through disunion! But more convincing
</p>
<p>evidence still of the intended effect of this resolution thus

<p>introduced, advocated by Wallace, and urged by Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son and Sebastian and their friend Innes; and, had zY been
</p>
<p>adopted, of the measure it proposed : is the exceeding
</p>
<p>great care taken to exclude it from the Littell pamphlet.
</p>
<p>Other portions of the proceedings of the convention were
</p>
<p>published in that paper ; but this resolution was carefully
</p>
<p>omitted. * Nor is there the most distant admission in it.

<p>* The resolution which was finally adopted by the convention was

</p>
<p>that such a resolution was ever, at any time, ottered. The
</p>
<p>editor of the Western World blundered in stating that it had
</p>
<p>been oiiered by Wilkinson and seconded by "Wallace, in
</p>
<p>the November convention. His mistake was greedily
</p>
<p>seized upon. The proceedings of the November convention
</p>
<p>were obtained from Thomas Todd and were published in

<p>the Appendix to Littell ; but that portion of the proceed-
</p>
<p>ings of the July convention which contained this resolu-
</p>
<p>tion was suppressed. Great parade was made in the
</p>
<p>" Narrative " of the fact, that the official proceedings of
</p>
<p>the November convention showed that the resolution had
</p>
<p>7iot been offered at that meeting, * and over the further
</p>
<p>fact that Wallace was not even a member of the November
</p>
<p>published at the time in the Lexington Gazette, but tins resolution of
</p>
<p>Wilkinson and Wallace was kept out of sight.
</p>
<p>""The " Narrative of the Political Transactions," contains the following,
</p>
<p>referring to the statement that this resolution had been offered at the
</p>
<p>November convention of 1788 :
</p>
<p>" Here it was (in the November convention) that General Wilkinson
</p>
<p>read his treasonable memorial  here it was that Mr. Brown reported
</p>
<p>his treasonable conference  and here it was (as they say in their first
</p>
<p>number,) that General Wilkhi^nin nnulc a Irmsonable motion that they should
</p>
<p>proceed to form a separati' ciinxtiiiiHiMi Imhprndmt of the approbation of Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia. The reader will see from the Journal, that Wilkinson made no
</p>
<p>such motion, and that the motion which he did make, so far from tend-
</p>
<p>ing to so rapid a progress was of a retrograde tendency. Its object was
</p>
<p>not to proceed to do any thing, except to impart to the people at large
</p>
<p>the information which had been received by that body, and to await
</p>
<p>their future instructions. They say further, that this motion was
</p>
<p>seconded by .Judge W^allace, now of the Court of Appeals. It is pre-
</p>
<p>sumed that the falsehood of this assertion is sufficiently proved by
</p>
<p>showing that the motion was never made. But it could be proved by a
</p>
<p>thousand witnesses that Judge 'Wallace never seconded any motion
</p>
<p>whatever, which was made in that convention, for this plain reason,

<p>HE NEVER AVAS A MEMBER OF IT. And as if these men were not
</p>
<p>satisfied with being contradicted by all kinds of testimony, oral and
</p>
<p>written, living and dead, they have themselves in their twelfth number,
</p>
<p>proved by Dr. Brooke, one of their own witnesses, that Judge Wallace
</p>
<p>had no seat in that convention. They say further, that this motion was
</p>
<p>warmly supported by all those members who were supposed to be en-
</p>
<p>gaged in the negotiation with Gardoqui. I shall leave the reader to de-
</p>
<p>termine whether a motion which never was made could be warmly sup-
</p>
<p>ported, and to settle in his own mind what measure of confidence is due
</p>
<p>to men convicted of three palpable falsehoods in a single sentence."

</p>
<p>convention ; while the fact that the resolution had been
</p>
<p>offered by Wallace, and advocated by Wilkinson, in the Jiili/
</p>
<p>convention, was concealed. And thus the mistake of the
</p>
<p>editor as to the time, and, possibly, as to the person who
</p>
<p>oftered it, was branded as a malicious and baseless lie ; 
</p>
<p>when, as the reader will see, the only lie that was wantten in
</p>
<p>this connection was that which suppressed the official pro-
</p>
<p>ceedings which showed that the resolution had been
</p>
<p>offered in July, concealed the fact that it was then pre-
</p>
<p>sented by Wallace, and asserted that the " motion never ivas
</p>
<p>made."
</p>
<p>Whether this resolution was offered or seconded by him,
</p>
<p>it was all the same, the bantling of Caleb Wallace, who
</p>
<p>was one of the men who paid for the writing and publica-
</p>
<p>tion of Littell's " jSTarrative." It interferred with the line
</p>
<p>of defense adopted by Brown and Innes (who also paid
</p>
<p>for the writing and publication) and Wallace in that pro-
</p>
<p>duction. And it naturally, and for the same reasons,
</p>
<p>shared the fate of Brown's letter to Muter and of Innes'
</p>
<p>" Revolt from the Union," in his letter to Randolph ;  it was
</p>
<p>suppressed.
</p>
<p>In the deposition which Judge Wallace gave in behalf
</p>
<p>of his friend Innes, in the litigation with Humphrey Mar-
</p>
<p>shall, he replied to a niisleading question propounded by
</p>
<p>the plaintiff, that neither he, nor Innes, nor Sebastian, nor
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, nor any one else had, in the July convention,
</p>
<p>offered or advocated a proposition to " separate Kentucky
</p>
<p>from Virginia and from the Union, and to form a con-
</p>
<p>nection with Spain;" which it was not alleged had been
</p>
<p>done in terms. But he found it prudent to omit to men-
</p>
<p>tion, that he had himself offered or seconded and advocated
</p>
<p>a resolution to assume independence and sovereignty, to
</p>
<p>form a constitution and establish an independent govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and to violently separate from Virginia, the effect of

</p>
<p>which would have placed Kentucky outside of the Union ;
</p>
<p>that in one breath he had denounced Congress, and in the
</p>
<p>next urged his own and Wilkinson's measure as a means
</p>
<p>by which the navigation of the Mississippi could be ob-
</p>
<p>tained ;  all of which he had done if the evidence of good
</p>
<p>190 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>and true men, whose own conduct did not need to be con-
</p>
<p>cealed, is to be believed. He deemed it fitting to say that,
</p>
<p>when the information of the action of Congress was re-
</p>
<p>ceived, " it was conceived by the members of the conven-
</p>
<p>tion to be unnecessary and imp)roper to proceed to accom-
</p>
<p>plish the business for which they had been elected," 
</p>
<p>which was to form a constitution and organize govern-
</p>
<p>ment ;  leaving it to be inferred that this had been his
</p>
<p>own position, and concealing the fact that he had himself
</p>
<p>vehemently urged the convention to this " unnecessary
</p>
<p>and improper " proceeding. He had a splendid memory
</p>
<p>for things that nobody did; but in regard to what had ac-
</p>
<p>tually been done by Wilkinson, Sebastian, Innes and him-
</p>
<p>self, his mind was apparently a painful blank.
</p>
<p>But while he could not remember this resolution, nor
</p>
<p>his own and other speeches in its favor ; and while he
</p>
<p>could not, as he swore, even recollect whether Colonel
</p>
<p>Thomas Marshall was or was not a member of the July
</p>
<p>convention ;  yet his memory, so singularly treacherous
</p>
<p>in other respects, was as singularly convenient in recalling,
</p>
<p>that, as he alleged, " about that time, or shortly before,
</p>
<p>this deponent heard Colonel Marshall express great dis-
</p>
<p>satisfaction with Congress for having declined to decide
</p>
<p>on the application of the people of Kentucky to be erected
</p>
<p>into a separate state ; and declared that he was clear for
</p>
<p>proceeding to form a constitution of government and es-
</p>
<p>tablishing the district of Kentucky an independent state,
</p>
<p>and then apply for admission into the Union, not doubt-
</p>
<p>ing but it would be received without further delay."
</p>
<p>So that, if one could receive without examination this re-
</p>
<p>markable statement of Judge Wallace, as to his wonderful
</p>
<p>recollection, which diifered from that of any other human
</p>
<p>being as to Colonel Marshall's position and utterances, 
</p>
<p>he, who had oftered or seconded and had urged the resolu-

</p>
<p>tion, was in reality opposed to it as an " unnecessary and
</p>
<p>improper" proceeding; while Colonel Thomas Marshall,
</p>
<p>who, according to the concurrent testimony of all other
</p>
<p>contemporary witnesses, was, in jmblic, one of the earliest
</p>
<p>and most pronounced of the opponents of this and all
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 191
</p>
<p>similar revolutionary measures, was, in his 'private conver-
</p>
<p>sations, one of its staunchest advocates ! Had this most
</p>
<p>convenient and swift of witnesses "remembered" that
</p>
<p>Colonel Marshall was a member of the convention, and, as
</p>
<p>such, had sanctioned this movement, his statement could
</p>
<p>and would have been easily contradicted by those who were
</p>
<p>present, which Judge Wallace knew. But the peculiar
</p>
<p>advantage of remembering a private conversation with a
</p>
<p>man whose tongue had been silenced by death was one of
</p>
<p>which Judge Wallace was not unmindful. The dead man
</p>
<p>whom he wronged could not challenge his injurious state-
</p>
<p>ment; and, though the alleged recollection Avas inconsist-
</p>
<p>ent with all that Colonel Marshall did or said in public,
</p>
<p>and utterly irreconcilable with the recollections of all oth-
</p>
<p>ers of his utterances to them, yet no living witness could
</p>
<p>disprove this ingenious recollection of Judge Wallace as
</p>
<p>to what Colonel Marshall had privately said to him.
</p>
<p>Colonel John Mason Brown wished to have it appear,
</p>
<p>not simply that Colonel Marshall was inconsistent, but
</p>
<p>that he had a motive for his inconsistency ; that, with a
</p>
<p>full knowledge of Gardoqui's proposition, he had, as a
</p>
<p>member of the July convention, voted for the resolution
</p>
<p>of Wilkinson and Wallace ; that afterwards, and before
</p>
<p>the November convention, he had himself received and
</p>
<p>favorably entertained a proposition from Dr. Connolly, to
</p>
<p>withdraw Kentucky from the Union and place her under
</p>
<p>a British protectorate ; and that his opposition to the pol-
</p>
<p>icy of John Brown during the canvass preceding the No-
</p>
<p>vember convention, as well as his opposition in that con-
</p>
<p>vention, was influenced by Connolly and prompted by his
</p>
<p>desire to aid the latter. That for this object he opposed
</p>
<p>and defeated the patriotic efforts of Brown to secure an-
</p>
<p>other immediate application by Kentucky for admission
</p>
<p>into the Union !

</p>
<p>To this line of argument, and to Colonel Brown's wish
</p>
<p>to shelter his grandfather behind the skirts of Colonel
</p>
<p>Marshall, the public is indebted, that the resolution con-
</p>
<p>cocted between Wilkinson and Wallace, which was sup-
</p>
<p>pressed by the Littell pamphlet, appeared in the " Political
</p>
<p>192 The Sjxmish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Eegiiinings." For that reason the motion which Wallace
</p>
<p>completely ignored in his deposition, and which the " Nar-
</p>
<p>rative " solemnly asserted '' was never made," is reproduced
</p>
<p>by Colonel Brown; and Wallace's statement of his alleged
</p>
<p>recollection of what Colonel Marshall had said twenty-iive
</p>
<p>years before is put by the side of the resolution ;  then,
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown informs his readers, that * " It is worth
</p>
<p>noticing at this point that even Thomas Marshall, after-
</p>
<p>wards so strenuous in his denunciation of every one who
</p>
<p>approved the immediate formation of a constitution and an
</p>
<p>immediate application to Co7i(/ress, was then in perfect accord
</p>
<p>with Wallace as to the legality, propriety, and expediency
</p>
<p>of immediate action." That Wallace himself did not re-
</p>
<p>gard the action which he and Wilkinson proposed as legal,
</p>
<p>is proved by the language of the resolution, which de-
</p>
<p>clares " that the powers of this convention, so far as depends
</p>
<p>on the acts of the Legislature of Virginia, were annulled
</p>
<p>by the resolutions of Congress." The power which he
</p>
<p>proposed to exert was the same revolutionary power which
</p>
<p>Wilkinson had contended, in 1786, resided in the people
</p>
<p>of the district, and which was above lauh The resolution
</p>
<p>itself also shows that it did not embrace (as it is certain
</p>
<p>neither its author nor its advocates contemplated) the idea
</p>
<p>of an " immediate application to Congress," nor of any ap-
</p>
<p>plication to Congress. Neither Wallace, nor Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>Sebastian, nor Innes was so illogical as to have expected
</p>
<p>that the Congress which had, for the most cogent reasons,
</p>
<p>just declined to act upon the application which had been
</p>
<p>made under all the forms of law and with the expressed
</p>
<p>sanction of Virginia, would grant another application
</p>
<p>made in an irregular manner and without the concurrence
</p>
<p>of the state from wliich the resolution proposed violently
</p>
<p>to separate the district.
</p>
<p>In the same train of reasoning. Colonel Brown alleges

<p>that " the general sentiment of prominent men in the con-
</p>
<p>vention was, as Wallace deposed, that uttered by Colonel
</p>
<p>Marshall "in favor of immediate action as above stated.

</p>
<p>But Wallace did not thus depose. He did not say that
</p>
<p>Colonel Marshall was a member of the convention, but,
</p>
<p>on the contrary, could not remember whether he was or
</p>
<p>was not a member. He did not intimate that any one in
</p>
<p>the convention held the opinion stated by Colonel Brown.
</p>
<p>He even concealed the fact, that such a resolution as that
</p>
<p>which Wilkinson and he oifered and seconded was never
</p>
<p>offered in the convention, as well as the further fact that
</p>
<p>it had received his own approval. What he did say was,
</p>
<p>that the opinion he ascribed to Colonel Marshall " was be-
</p>
<p>lieved to be the sentiment of several respectable citizens of
</p>
<p>the district, and of so77ie who resided in other parts of the
</p>
<p>State of Virginia ;" and further, that " it was conceived by
</p>
<p>the members of the convention to be unnecessary and im-
</p>
<p>proper to proceed to form a constitution and organize gov-
</p>
<p>ernment." * Colonel Brown had read and understood
</p>
<p>the deposition to which he referred.
</p>
<p>One of the amusing features in all this mass of error is
</p>
<p>the contradictions between the positions taken in the de-
</p>
<p>fense of -John Brown and Innes, iu 1806, and those as-
</p>
<p>sumed by their latest and most deliberate and also most
</p>
<p>utterl}^ reckless champion, in 1890. In the Littell pam-
</p>
<p>phlet no pretense was made that Colonel Marshall was a
</p>
<p>member of the July convention, nor that he favored the
</p>
<p>resolution of Wilkinson and Wallace. On the contrary,
</p>
<p>it was denied that the resolution was ever offered. It was
</p>
<p>not pretended then that he had ever given countenance to
</p>
<p>such a scheme, either publicly or in his private conversa-
</p>
<p>tions. On the contrary, it was asserted in the communi-
</p>
<p>cations of " Franklin," written by one of the intimates
</p>
<p>and confidants of Brown, Innes, Sebastian, Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>and Wallace, that Colonel Marshall had, from the begin-
</p>
<p>ning, and all along, opposed any separation from Virginia,
</p>
<p>even with the consent of the General Assembly; and that

</p>
<p>local self government. This was the slander which his
</p>
<p>family were then called on to repel. And the motive at-
</p>
<p>tributed to him for this hostility was that he feared to lose
</p>
<p>his office of surveyor if Kentucky was separated from
</p>
<p>Virginia and erected into a state of the Union. It mat-
</p>
<p>tered not to his malicious calumniator that, the year be-

</p>
<p>in order to render himself eligible to a seat in the Virginia
</p>
<p>Assembly, to which he was elected and in which he served
</p>
<p>his constituents. The charge that he had opposed a
</p>
<p>legal separation from Virginia was effectually disposed
</p>
<p>of by Colonel Joseph Crockett, one of the heroes of Mon-
</p>
<p>mouth and of Yorktowu.*
</p>
<p>Colonel J. M. Brown quotes largely from the deposition

<p>of Christopher Greenup in the case of Imies v. Marshall.

</p>
<p>and could not have been overlooked by him, viz :

</p>
<p>Dear Sir :  In answer to your note of to-day, I can clearly state that
</p>
<p>I was long and intimately acquainted with Colonel Marshall, and the
</p>
<p>offices of civility were freely exchanged between us. In the commence-
</p>
<p>ment of the plan for separating from Virginia, I was myself opposed to
</p>
<p>the measure, as probably premature, and the arguments of Colonel
</p>
<p>Marshall convinced me that a separation was a proper measure  he
</p>
<p>pointed out various reasons, and many arguments in favor of a legal and
</p>
<p>constitutional separation. I was in the convention of November, 1788,
</p>
<p>with Colonel Marshall, and knew he was opposed to a violent separa-
</p>
<p>tion from the United States and took on that subject most decided
</p>
<p>grounds, but he was warmly in favor of a legal and constitutional sepa-
</p>
<p>ration. The charges of Franklin are not true.

<p>I am, dear sir, respectfully,

<p>Joseph Crockett.
</p>
<p>Alex. Marshall.
</p>
<p>Colonel Crockett intended to be understood that Colonel Marshall was
</p>
<p>in favor of a " legal and constitutional separation" from Virginia. There
</p>
<p>could have been no such thing as a " legal and constitutional separa-
</p>
<p>tion" from the United States. And that he was opposed to a "violent

<p>separation " from Virginia, which would also have "violently separated "

<p>Kentucky from the United States.

</p>
<p>tion having been offered by Wallace in the November con-
</p>
<p>vention, but accepted as correct the recollection that Wal-
</p>
<p>lace was its author. He knew that the defense made of
</p>
<p>his grandfather, Innes, Sebastian, Wilkinson and Wallace,
</p>
<p>in the Littell pamphlet, suppressed the resolution, and as-
</p>
<p>serted that such a " motion was never made." He de-
</p>
<p>tected the deceit. Whether his emotions were pleasant or
</p>
<p>otherwise at that detection, must have depended on
</p>
<p>whether he admired the cunning which he has imitated or
</p>
<p>felt contempt for the fraud disclosed to his view. While
</p>
<p>quoting Greenup as to the presentation and authorship of
</p>
<p>the resolution, he excludes from his book Greenup's state-
</p>
<p>ment, made in the same deposition, of his distinct recol-
</p>
<p>lection that he had heard Colonel Marshall express his
</p>
<p>opposition to the resolution he alleged to have been offered
</p>
<p>by Wallace, though this was not done as a member of the
</p>
<p>convention.*
</p>
<p>In his letter to Miro, of February 12, 1789, Wilkinson
</p>
<p>tells of the opposition made by Colonel Marshall and
</p>
<p>* Humphrey Marshall propounded to Greenup the following questions
</p>
<p>and received the following answers, viz :
</p>
<p>" Question 1st : Was there a party in Kentucky in 1788, who was for
</p>
<p>a separation of Kentucky from Virginia without an act of Virginia for
</p>
<p>that purpose, and were General Wilkinson, John Brown, Benjamin Se-
</p>
<p>bastian, the plaintiff", Caleb Wallace and others of that party?
</p>
<p>"Answer: I have stated in answer to the 7th interrogatory of the
</p>
<p>plaintiff, of a resolution or motion being stated to the convention to
</p>
<p>form a constitution without again applying to Virginia, and for the
</p>
<p>reason therein mentioned, but I know nothing of a party being formed
</p>
<p>for that purpose.
</p>
<p>" 2nd Q. : Were the late Colonel Thomas Marshall, the late Judge
</p>
<p>Muter, Colonel Joseph Crockett, Colonel John Edwards, and others in
</p>
<p>the convention of November, 1788, opposed to the party aforesaid, and
</p>
<p>in favor of a regular and legal separation ?

<p>" Answer : I can not say at this length of time whether all the gentle-
</p>
<p>men in the preceding interrogatory were present in November, 1788, but
</p>
<p>think they were. I knew of no party they opposed except it be the
</p>
<p>resolution or motion before mentioned. That resolution I am certain
</p>
<p>they were opposed to, and were in favor of again applying to the State of
</p>
<p>Virginia : this opinion I have heard most of the gentlemen express, as
</p>
<p>well as others who were also present."

<p>Greenup was the witness of Innes, and was personally hostile to H,

</p>
<p>Muter, before the assembling of the July convention, to
</p>
<p>his plans, the first necessary step in which was to adopt
</p>
<p>this resolution of Wallace. * In the ' Outline History,'' pub-
</p>
<p>lished in Collins, McClung says of Colonel Marshall, that
</p>
<p>" his opposition to independence, contrary to law, was
</p>
<p>early, decided and uncompromising." In Littell no pre-
</p>
<p>tense was made, that Colonel Marshall had ever for a
</p>
<p>moment countenanced sucli a proposition, though the men
</p>
<p>who procured that publication were anxious to slur and to
</p>
<p>convict him of inconsistency. Flatly contradicted by
</p>
<p>Greenup, opposed by the statemejit of liis own friend and

<p>leader, Wilkinson, refuted by Muter, repelled by Crockett,

<p>witness, and utterly inconsistent and irreconcilable as the

<p>ance of Colonel Marshall, the accuracy of his alleged
</p>
<p>" recollection " of the private conversation of a dead, man,
</p>
<p>* In his letter to Miro, July 12, 1789, [Gayarre, page 225], Wilkinson
</p>
<p>asserted, that, when he sought to " prepare the ground for the seed to
</p>
<p>be deposited in it," by giving "an equivocal shape to his designs," he
</p>
<p>" found all the men belonging to the first class of society in the district,
</p>
<p>with the exception of Colonel Marshall, our surveyor, and Colonel Muter,
</p>
<p>one of our judges,, decidedly in favor of separatioia from the United
</p>
<p>States and of an alliance with Spain." While this gross exaggeration
</p>
<p>did much injustice to many excellent and jiatriotic citizens, there can be
</p>
<p>no sort of question that very many of the prominent men in the state did
</p>
<p>favor that movement. And without detracting from the merit, influence
</p>
<p>or importance of any of the men who stood by and abreast of them in their
</p>
<p>efforts to defeat it, it is sufficient to say that not one of them was more
</p>
<p>active or zealous than either Muter or Marshall. In his rage against
</p>
<p>" those two men " Wilkinson pretended to Miro, that " at first," they
</p>
<p>" expressed the same opinion with warmth," and had changed "from
</p>
<p>private motives of interest and personal pique ; " that he " foresaw they
</p>
<p>would avail themselves of the opposition of some literary demagogues,

<p>who were under the influence of fear and prejudice." '^ Neverthelesi<,"
</p>
<p>he wrote, " I determined to lay the question before the convention, and
</p>
<p>I took the necessary measures accordingly. I was thus engaged until the
</p>
<p>28ih of July, on which day our convention met at Danville." The explicit
</p>
<p>statement that the hostility of Marshall and Muter commenced before
</p>
<p>the Jidy convention was true. The statement that they had at first coun-
</p>
<p>tenanced his views, and had turned against them from personal motives,
</p>
<p>was but the expression of spleen which the baffled conspirator always
</p>
<p>vents upon the men who thwart him, and to cover his own mortification
</p>
<p>at the disappointment of the hopes he had aroused in Miro, by repre-

<p>twenty-four years after he asserted it to have taken place,
</p>
<p>may safely be challenged.
</p>
<p>The resolution of Wilkinson and Wallace was defeated.
</p>
<p>A proposition was then made, that each militia captain
</p>
<p>should take the sense of his company upon- the course to
</p>
<p>be pursued, and that the public action should be controlled
</p>
<p>by their decision. This also was defeated by the argu-
</p>
<p>ments of those who were opposed to an illegal separation,
</p>
<p>among the ablest and most conspicuous of whom were
</p>
<p>Colonel John Edwards and Judge John Allen. In a
</p>
<p>measure overawed by this determined opposition, the Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson party iinally succeeded in passing through the con-
</p>
<p>vention, which had no legal power whatever, a recommen-
</p>
<p>dation that the people should elect members to another
</p>
<p>convention to be held at Danville in the following Novem-
</p>
<p>ber, and to continue in power until January 1, 1790 ; and
</p>
<p>that the people should delegate to their representatives in
</p>
<p>this convention "full powers to take such measures for the
</p>
<p>admission of the district, as a separate and independent
</p>
<p>member of the United States of America ; and the naviga-
</p>
<p>tion of the Mississippi, as may appear most conducive to
</p>
<p>those purposes ; and also to fonn a constitution of govern-
</p>
<p>ment for the district and organize the same, vdien they shall
</p>
<p>DEEM NECESSARY ; or to do and accomplish whatsoever, on a
</p>
<p>consideration of the state of the district, may, in their
</p>
<p>judgment, promote its interests^ The powers the people
</p>
<p>were invited to commit to the convention were, indeed, as
</p>
<p>stated by Butler, all those ever wielded by a dictator 
</p>
<p>powers inconsistent with constitutional and organized gov-
</p>
<p>ernments.
</p>
<p>The resolution of recommendation embraced a variety
</p>
<p>of topics. One was an application for admission into the
</p>
<p>Union. But those who framed the resolution knew that

</p>
<p>fraction of the Articles of the Confederation and of the
</p>
<p>constitution, be received either into that Confederation or
</p>
<p>into the new Union ; and it is thus evident that the
</p>
<p>question of applying for admission into the Union was

<p>198 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>combined with tile others solely because without it the
</p>
<p>others could not be carried. Another was the navigation
</p>
<p>of the Mississij^pi. But the authors and contrivers of the
</p>
<p>resolution knew that Spain alone controlled that question,
</p>
<p>and they knew also the price demanded by Spain for her
</p>
<p>favors. They were aware that Congress had not been able
</p>
<p>to obtain, and could not then obtain that navigation for
</p>
<p>the people of the district, while those people could not
</p>
<p>obtain it for themselves in any other way than by separa-
</p>
<p>tion from the Union. Finally, the recommendation in-
</p>
<p>cluded any thing and every thing which the representa-
</p>
<p>tives elected to the coming convention might deem calcu-
</p>
<p>lated to " promote the interests of the district^'" the first and
</p>
<p>greatest of which interests these men had declared to be
</p>
<p>the navigation of the Mississippi, which the authors and
</p>
<p>advocates of the resolution were apprized could be ob-
</p>
<p>tained from Spain on certain conditions^ which had been
</p>
<p>agreed upon between "Wilkinson and Miro.
</p>
<p>The debate which ensued upon this recommendation
</p>
<p>elicited expressions from, and developed views on the part
</p>
<p>of its advocates, which excited a just alarm among those
</p>
<p>to whom the intrigues with the Spaniard had not been re-
</p>
<p>vealed save by the vague inuendoes of Wilkinson. The
</p>
<p>publication of the resolutions passed by the convention
</p>
<p>did not allay or dissipate the well grounded apprehension
</p>
<p>of those who heard the debate, but increased it and spread
</p>
<p>it among law-abiding people. The public declarations
</p>
<p>for an alliance with Spain had not been explicit. But
</p>
<p>enough had been let fall by covert hints and insinuations,
</p>
<p>when associated with actions in this convention, to explain
</p>
<p>to some the mystery of Wilkinson's transactions at New
</p>
<p>Orleans and the consideration for which he enjoyed ex-

<p>clusive commercial privileges. Unable to defeat the

<p>nents determined upon a vigorous opposition to the meas-
</p>
<p>ures it foreshadowed, to be made through the press and
</p>
<p>upon the rostrum.
</p>
<p>Among the resolutions passed by the July convention
</p>
<p>was one directing its president, upon the return of John
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 199
</p>
<p>Brown to the district, to wait upon him, " and, in the
</p>
<p>most respectful terms express to him the obligations which
</p>
<p>this convention and their constituents are under to him
</p>
<p>for his faithful attention to their interests in Congress."
</p>
<p>This formal and courteous expression of thanks had been
</p>
<p>well earned by John Brown's services in Congress, which
</p>
<p>had really been at once attentive and faithful. It had no
</p>
<p>reference to his conduct with Gardoqui, which was not known
</p>
<p>to any member of the convention except as only partially
</p>
<p>declared in the " sliding letter," the contents of which
</p>
<p>were known only to McDowell, whose testimony shows
</p>
<p>that he misunderstood the character of. the proposition ;
</p>
<p>and to Innes, who, by the aid of the light cast upon it by
</p>
<p>his previous knowledge of Wilkinson's arrangement with
</p>
<p>Miro, understood it correctly ; and to others to whom its
</p>
<p>contents were communicated by Innes. For this resolu-
</p>
<p>tion of thanks which he had earned, the men who had,
</p>
<p>when they were informed thereof and understood its
</p>
<p>nature, the most severe and just appreciation of the tur-
</p>
<p>pitude involved in John Brown's conduct with Gardoqui,
</p>
<p>might have voted in good faith, without inconsistency,
</p>
<p>without rendering themselves justly amenable to the in-
</p>
<p>sinuation that when the vote was given they approved of
</p>
<p>that conduct, and were stultified by their subsequent con-
</p>
<p>demnation thereof. The weakness of a bad cause was
</p>
<p>never more conspicuously manifested than by the attempts
</p>
<p>made in the Littell pamphlet, in the libel suit of Innes v.
</p>
<p>Marshall, and in the " Political Beginnings," to smirch
</p>
<p>those who knew of John Brown's " sliding letter," (which
</p>
<p>only partially recorded the Gardoqui overture) and yet
</p>
<p>voted an empty resolution of thanks to him for faithful
</p>
<p>services which had no relation to that overture, as if by
</p>
<p>that vote they had participated in Brown's ofl'ense, and
</p>
<p>were estopped from its condemnation. But were this ar-

<p>gument as forcible as it is flimsy, still no shelter for
</p>
<p>Brown can be had in the alleged inconsistency of others.
</p>
<p>It has been seen that McDowell efl'ectually exploded that
</p>
<p>weak defense; if the " sliding letter" was known to any
</p>
<p>one in the convention besides Innes and himself, it was
</p>
<p>200 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>communicated to ,tliem by Innes, who had a motive for
</p>
<p>making known what McDowell treated as " confidential."
</p>
<p>As the same sophistry is introduced by Colonel Brown
</p>
<p>even less regard is shown for the facts. He says : " The
</p>
<p>letter from Broion to 31uter w^as known to Marshall and
</p>
<p>Edwards," when this resolution of thanks was passed ;
</p>
<p>and he alleges, that " McDowell had its duplicate," 
</p>
<p>wdiich the reader knows McDowell did not have. Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown continues: '^ " The estimate of those who knew of
</p>
<p>that letter [it does not certainly appear whether Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown referred to the Muter or to the McDowell letter,
</p>
<p>but, as he says that one was " duplicate " of the other,
</p>
<p>it does not matter], and its contents, and of the interview
</p>
<p>with Gardoqui was expressed in a resolution [the resolu-
</p>
<p>tion of thanks to Brown] for which Muter and Marshall
</p>
<p>voted along with the other delegates." The official report
</p>
<p>of the proceedings does not state who voted for the reso-
</p>
<p>lutions; nor does it show who were the members of the
</p>
<p>convention ; it gives the names of the president, McDow-
</p>
<p>ell, of the secretary, Todd, and of the chairman of the
</p>
<p>committee . of the whole, Isaac Shelby, only. Its state-
</p>
<p>ment that the resolutions were "unanimously" carried
</p>
<p>does not indicate that every man in the convention voted
</p>
<p>for them, but only that no negative vote was cast or re-
</p>
<p>corded. Colonel Brown had no authority whatever that
</p>
<p>either Muter or Marshall voted for that resolution. In
</p>
<p>his letter published in the Lezington Gazette in 1790, which
</p>
<p>was republished in 1806, and an extract from which, in-
</p>
<p>cluding this statement, was copied into the ''Narrative "
</p>
<p>by Littell, Muter asserted that he loas not a member of the
</p>
<p>* Here Colonel Brown imitated the exploit of his grandfather. When
</p>
<p>the latter wished to conceal the real nature of the proposition of Gar-
</p>
<p>doqui, and the character of the letter he wrote to Muter, he suppressed
</p>
<p>that letter, published McDowell's account of the " sliding letter," and

</p>
<p>pretended that the " letter to Muter gave the same account that the
</p>
<p>letter of McDowell did. The grandson, wishing to make as bad a case
</p>
<p>as possible for all who knew of the " sliding letter," and yet voted to
</p>
<p>thank .John Brown for his services in Congress, publishes the letter to
</p>
<p>Muter, in a mutilated form, suppresses the McDowell letter, and says

<p>July convention of 1788. In his letter of August 20,
</p>
<p>1806, whicli accompanied the reproduction of the one just
</p>
<p>mentioned, and which was published in the Western
</p>
<p>World and in the Lexington Gazette, he reasserted : " I was
</p>
<p>a member of the convention of I^ovember, 1788, though
</p>
<p>not of July, 1788." This is fully confirmed by Humphrey
</p>
<p>Marshall in his History. If the list of the members of
</p>
<p>that convention published by Collins was relied upon by
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown, it also proved to him that Muter was not
</p>
<p>a member. The writings of Colonel Brown exhibit his
</p>
<p>familiarity with all the records and publications which
</p>
<p>give emphatic and explicit contradiction to his own state-
</p>
<p>ments. He had no ground for rejecting their statements, nor
</p>
<p>any authority whatever for his own. And Muter asserted
</p>
<p>just as positivel}^ that '' 31r. Brown's letter to me came to hand
</p>
<p>in the fall of 1788." The address of Muter to the people,
</p>
<p>which shortly followed the receipt of that letter, was
</p>
<p>dated October 16, 1788. Muter not having been a mem-
</p>
<p>ber of the July convention could not possibly have voted
</p>
<p>for the resolution. And a letter which was not received
</p>
<p>until the fall of 1788 could not have been known to Muter,
</p>
<p>Edwards or Marshall in the preceding July. The neces-
</p>
<p>sity for constituting Muter a member of the convention,
</p>
<p>and of placing in his hands a letter in July which he did
</p>
<p>not receive until more than a month later, was in order to
</p>
<p>give color to Colonel Brown's statement, that when, as he
</p>
<p>alleges. Colonel Marshall voted to thank Brown for his
</p>
<p>services in Congress, he knew of Brown's letter to Muter.
</p>
<p>It adds another example to many others, of Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown's extraordinary fecundity of inaccuracy.
</p>
<p>It must have seemed very doubtful, to say the least, to
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown himself, whether his statement that Colonel
</p>
<p>Marshall was a member of that convention was any more
</p>
<p>true than was his assertion that Muter was a member,
</p>

</p>
<p>which is contradicted by all the records with which he was
</p>
<p>familiar. It is true that Colonel Marshall's name is given
</p>
<p>as a member in the inaccurate list published by Collins. But
</p>
<p>as that list showed him the untruth of his own statement
</p>
<p>that Muter was a member, the error of Collins will scarcely
</p>
<p>202 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>serve as a screen for Colonel Brown. Collins also gave
</p>
<p>the name of John Brown, who was in Congress in New
</p>
<p>York, in the list of th members from Mercer. He did
</p>
<p>not obtain his statement from the official report of the
</p>
<p>convention, for the name of Marshall nowhere appears
</p>
<p>thereon. He w^as not misled by the deposition of Wallace,
</p>
<p>for he could not remember whether Colonel Marshall was
</p>
<p>or was not a member of the July convention. And he
</p>
<p>knew that Humphrey Marshall, who had personal knowl-
</p>
<p>edge and accurate recollection of the fact, liad stated, in
</p>
<p>his History, that neither Muter nor 3Iarshall were mem-
</p>
<p>bers of that convention. [Vol. I, page 298, edition of
</p>
<p>1824.] The fact is that Colonel Marshall was no more a
</p>
<p>member of that convention tlian was Muter. There were
</p>
<p>but five members from Fayette, and those were James
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, Caleb Wallace, John Allen, and William
</p>
<p>Ward, whose names are given by Collins correctly, and
</p>
<p>Dr. Ebenezer Brooks, who w^as one of the " literary dema-
</p>
<p>gogues,'' whom Wilkinson complained of Colonel Marshall
</p>
<p>for having employed to defeat his project. It was Dr.
</p>
<p>Brooks who wrote over the signature of " Cornplanter."
</p>
<p>The fact that he was a member distinctly appears in the
</p>
<p>controversies of 1788 and of 1806. All the scenes pict-
</p>
<p>ured by Colonel Brown of Marshall and Muter as mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the July convention, and voting as such for meas-
</p>
<p>sures which within a few weeks they publicly opposed
</p>
<p>and denounced, is merely an average specimen of Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown's wonderfully inventive genius.
</p>
<p>Of a like nature with his statement in regard to their
</p>
<p>alleged vote for the empty resolution of thanks, is Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown's assertion that Muter, Marshall and Edwards were
</p>
<p>among the members acquiescing in the vote by which the
</p>
<p>recommendatory resolution w^as passed. It is not true
</p>
<p>that Colonel Marshall or Muter were members of the con-

<p>vention. And if the patriotic Colonel John Edwards sat
</p>
<p>silent while a resolution was passed which he had already
</p>
<p>resisted and was then powerless to defeat, it would no
</p>
<p>more indicate that he had acquiesced therein, or that he
</p>
<p>concurred in its policy, than that John Brown's " holding
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 203
</p>
<p>his peace" when Dane's substitute was passed by Con-
</p>
<p>gress proved that he acquiesced therein or concurred in
</p>
<p>the postponement of the apphcation he had presented.
</p>
<p>Not only is this entire line of aro;ument utterly flimsy and
</p>
<p>fallacious, but the allegations made to sustain it are shown
</p>
<p>to be invariably untrue. Its sole importance is as an
</p>
<p>illustration of the methods employed in John Brown's

<p>defense.*
</p>
<p>* Col. Marshall, though not a member, was a spectator of the July

<p>Convention. Humphrey Marshall had been elected a member of the

<p>Assembly of 1788, as well as a member of the Virginia Convention of
</p>
<p>the same year which adopted the Constitution ;  which was a sufficient
</p>
<p>reason why the elder Marshall was not at the same time a candidate for

</p>
<p>Immediately upon the publication of the action of the
</p>
<p>July convention, in the Lexington Gazette, the alarm
</p>
<p>which was created found an utterance through the col-
</p>
<p>umns of that paper, sufficiently articulate to indicate the
</p>
<p>nature and depth of the apprehensions felt by the more
</p>
<p>reflecting. Before that convention, as stated by Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son in his letter to Miro, of February 12, 1789, " the ques-
</p>
<p>tion of separation from the United States, although dis-
</p>
<p>cussed with vehemence among the most distinguished inhabit-
</p>
<p>ants of this section of the country, had never been mentioned,
</p>
<p>in a formal manner, to the people at large." It has been
</p>
<p>seen that an effort was made in that convention to sepa-
</p>
<p>rate from Virginia, and to assume independence and sov-
</p>
<p>ereignty without an act for the purpose, and without the
</p>
<p>assent of Congress, which, to the extent it could have
</p>
<p>been made effective, would have separated Kentucky from
</p>
<p>the United States. Wilkinson correctly represented the
</p>
<p>real and intended effect, though not the precise terms, of
</p>
<p>what was proposed and urged in that convention when he
</p>
<p>wrote to Miro, in the same letter to which reference has
</p>
<p>been made, that the "Honorable Caleb Wallace, one of
</p>
<p>our Supreme Judges, the Attorney General Inues, and
</p>
<p>Benjamin Sebastian proposed a 'prompt separation from, the

</p>
<p>Union, and advocated with intrepidity the necessity of the

</p>
<p>movement." That the purpose of the proposition was that
</p>
<p>of disunion, as was directly charged upon the leaders of
</p>
<p>the Wilkinson party from the rostrum, this and other
</p>
<p>letters of the leader of that party, clearly establish. The
</p>
<p>plan was not, however, distinctly developed and avowed
</p>
<p>in their communication to the people, by these projectors
</p>
<p>of the scheme of disunion and a negotiation with Spain,
</p>
<p>who feared the people might not yet be ready for its adop-
</p>
<p>tion. The question of a separation from the Union, and a
</p>
<p>Spanish alliance was still kept in the background. But a
</p>

<p>that the opposition to her admission as such would be con-

</p>
<p>There can be no question that the power the people were
</p>
<p>thus asked to delegate, included, and was designed to in-
</p>
<p>clude, that of separation from the United States. If the
</p>
<p>people could only be persuaded to take this step with suffi-
</p>
<p>cient unanimity, the election of delegates to the convention
</p>
<p>would impliedly carry with it the delegation of the power
</p>
<p>requested. In shaping its action, the November conven-
</p>
<p>tion would then be governed by circumstances. If the
</p>
<p>public pulse indicated that it could be done safely, their
</p>
<p>formal declaration of sovereignty would be accompanied
</p>
<p>by an equally formal and explicit withdrawal froni the
</p>
<p>Union, and that would be followed by the appointment of
</p>
<p>a " proper person to negotiate with Spain for the exporta-
</p>
<p>tion of their produce on the Mississippi;"  this would de-
</p>
<p>pend on the success of the inflammatory denunciations of
</p>
<p>the " sinister purposes " of Congress, in working up the
</p>
<p>people to a white heat. But, if the patient, conservative,
</p>
<p>law abiding and liberty loving people insisted on yet an-
</p>
<p>other application to Congress, then, if the way was clear,
</p>
<p>they would, by previously wrenching the district violently
</p>
<p>apart from Virginia, so complicate that application that
</p>
<p>the Congress of the confederation, which had already ex-
</p>
<p>plicitly and unanswerably stated its want of power in the
</p>
<p>premises, could not grant the application without a more
</p>
<p>gross violation of faith and duty. In the meantime the
</p>
<p>constitution would be framed, the government would be
</p>
<p>organized, the separation from Virginia would be con-
</p>
<p>summated, Kentucky would be declared independent and
</p>
<p>sovereign, regardless of Virginia's laws, of the Constitu-
</p>
<p>tion of the United States, which had then been adopted,
</p>
<p>of allegiance to the State of Virginia, or to the Union.

<p>In this condition of insurrection, the anticipated and cer- 
</p>
<p>tain rejection of the application by the Congress of the
</p>
<p>new government would find her people. This fresh refusal

<p>against seizure by the whites, wonld be used to exasperate
</p>
<p>the hitherto patient, but warlike Kentuckians, until, as
</p>
<p>the conspirators hoped, they would be ready to take the
</p>
<p>plunge into the wide open arms of the Spaniard ! For
</p>
<p>this fatal leap, the embarrassments surrounding the organ-
</p>
<p>ization of the new government, the want of an army, of
</p>
<p>money and of credit, combined to make all things seem
</p>
<p>propitious. If it be said that this is a prejudiced or a par-
</p>
<p>tisan picture, it must still be admitted to be an accurate
</p>
<p>reproduction of that distinctly limned upon the canvas,
</p>
<p>in ineffaceable and damning colors, in his letters to Miro,
</p>
<p>by the master hand of Wilkinson, the leader of the move-
</p>
<p>ment, around whom, as if in deference to his more fertile
</p>
<p>resources, to his superior talents, and greater courage, the
</p>
<p>others revolved as humble and admiring satellites. And
</p>
<p>Butler, who wrote for the conspirators an apology, which,
</p>
<p>however feeble it may have been, was still the best that
</p>
<p>could be offered, could draw no other conclusion from the
</p>
<p>letter of John Brown to Muter, than that " Mr. Brown,
</p>
<p>and in all probability many other of the ancient statesmen
</p>
<p>of Kentucky, did incline to discuss, if not to adopt, a con-
</p>
<p>nection with Spain, independent of the feeble and dis-
</p>
<p>graced Union which then existed." Without detracting
</p>
<p>in the least from the historic value and frankness of this
</p>
<p>admission, their obsequious apologist might well have
</p>
<p>added, that these same " ancient statesmen " had done
</p>
<p>much to " disgrace " that Union, which they nevertheless
</p>
<p>preferred, because of its feebleness, to the stronger and
</p>
<p>" more perfect Union " which had then been established, and
</p>
<p>to which they were hostile because of its anticipated

<p>strength.

<p>him for the time being from the evil influence which John

<p>had signed the circular of March 29, 1787. He had in the

</p>
<p>he had become a' neighbor of Colonel Thomas Marshall,
</p>
<p>with whom he had maintained a friendship of long stand-
</p>
<p>ing, which liad been formed in Virginia before the Revo-
</p>
<p>lution ; which had been continued during that struggle, in
</p>
<p>which Muter liad been for a time a Colonel of Infantry in
</p>
<p>the State Line, and afterwards commissioner of the Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia war office; and ^\llich was renewed after both had
</p>
<p>i-emoved to Kentucky, where Marshall was surveyor of
</p>
<p>Fayette county, and Muter had become Chief Justice of
</p>
<p>the District Court. Muter being a bachelor, was fre-
</p>
<p>quently the guest of his friend, almost an inmate of his
</p>
<p>family.
</p>
<p>As stated by himself in the letter published in 1790, Muter
</p>
<p>knew that at least a part of the letter written by John Brown
</p>
<p>to McDowell had been read in the Danville convention of
</p>
<p>July, 1788, though the part read was not the " sliding let-
</p>
<p>ter " referring to the Gardoqui proposition. As also stated
</p>
<p>by him, he knew that John Brown had written other let-
</p>
<p>ters to other persons in the district, which were received
</p>
<p>before and after the July convention, and which were
</p>
<p>similar to the one he himself afterwards received ;  which
</p>
<p>urged Kentucky to assume independence and sovereignty,
</p>
<p>and as a motive for that precipitate step revealed the over-
</p>
<p>ture which Gardoqui had artfully made. When he re-
</p>
<p>ceived the letter from John Brown addressed to himself,
</p>
<p>which it appears from his own letter referred to, was not
</p>
<p>until the fall of 1788, and thus had the scheme placed cir-
</p>
<p>cumstantially and plainly before his very eyes ;  the ami-
</p>
<p>able Muter could not but associate the statements made
</p>
<p>and advice given and the Spanish overture revealed
</p>
<p>by John Brown, with the covert inuendoes which had
</p>
<p>been so frequently let fall by Wilkinson ; with the actions
</p>
<p>of the latter and of his coterie in the July convention ;

<p>separation from Virginia and the prompt organization of
</p>
<p>an independent state, without a law for that purpose ; and
</p>
<p>with the exclusive privilege of trade which had been
</p>
<p>granted by the Spaniard to Wilkinson. Whatever had
</p>
<p>seemed mysterious and equivocal in all these circum-

<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 209
</p>
<p>stances, actions and hints, were explained by the letter of
</p>
<p>John Brown on which the pained eyes of Muter now rested.
</p>
<p>The old Scotchman had an abundance of mere physical
</p>
<p>courage ; but he had always lacked, and continued to lack,
</p>
<p>firmness; he was wanting in self assertion, unstable and
</p>
<p>irresolute. He seems to have been at bottom honest, true
</p>
<p>hearted and averse to intrigue ;  yet he had always been a
</p>
<p>man easily seduced by the stronger natures around him,
</p>
<p>and in later years permitted his love of ease, his fear of
</p>
<p>losing a position necessary to his support, and his reluct-
</p>
<p>ance to wound even by adhering to the truth, to induce
</p>
<p>him to stultify himself by equivocation and by going
</p>
<p>squarely back on his own previous honest declarations.
</p>
<p>The first sentiment of this kindly, well disposed and at
</p>
<p>heart patriotic man, on reading John Brown's letter, was
</p>
<p>one of revulsion and reprehension. It may well be con-
</p>
<p>ceived that his next was one of mortification and self con-
</p>
<p>demnation, that in his past association with Brown and
</p>
<p>Innes there had been aught to make Brown suppose he
</p>
<p>could be made an accessory in a business like that indi-
</p>
<p>cated by Brown's letter. Then came a patriotic and manly
</p>
<p>resolve, of which the most amiable and the weakest natures
</p>
<p>that are naturally honest are frequently capable, to do the
</p>
<p>part of a true man in counteracting the scheme which
</p>
<p>had been disclosed to his view. He knew, as he himself
</p>
<p>stated, as every one else knew,  as Caleb Wallace especi-
</p>
<p>ally very well knew,  that Colonel Marshall had been
</p>
<p>immovably opposed to an illegal separation from Virginia,,
</p>
<p>to a withdrawal from the Union, and to all the plans de-
</p>
<p>veloped in the July convention. Led by a desire to thwart
</p>
<p>the scheme of disunion revealed in Brown's letter, and in-
</p>
<p>stinctively recognizing in his neighbor a more steadfast,
</p>
<p>a bolder, a stronger and more aggressive nature than his
</p>
<p>own, united to a clear judgment and prompt decision,  a

</p>
<p>man on whose unyielding courage he could rely and in
</p>
<p>whose tried patriotism he could confide, he exhibited the
</p>
<p>letter of Brown to Colonel Marshall.
</p>
<p>To the healthy mind of the latter, Brown, in disclosing
</p>
<p>such a matter to Muter, could not place it under the seal
</p>
<p>14
</p>
<p>210 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>of confidence. Besides, Brown, who had written to
</p>
<p>Muter and to others, " with the permission of the Spanish
</p>
<p>minister," " not doubting but that they would make a
</p>
<p>prudent use of the information," had, by this distinct in-
</p>
<p>timation conveyed to Muter his wish that the latter, whom
</p>
<p>he supposed would be favorable to the project, would com-
</p>
<p>municate it to those whom he found to be equally favorable.
</p>
<p>The mistake Brown had made as to Muter was his mis-
</p>
<p>fortune and no fault of Muter, who, in the view of Mar-
</p>
<p>shall, had as much right to use, and was in duty bound to
</p>
<p>use to defeat and thwart, the information Brown had com-
</p>
<p>municated as a means of forwarding, the project. As the
</p>
<p>most effectual means of baffling the objects of the writer
</p>
<p>of that letter. Colonel Marshall, therefore, urged its im-
</p>
<p>mediate publication, with comments explanatory of its
</p>
<p>character, for the purpose of enabling the people to pene-
</p>
<p>trate the meaning of the clamor in the late convention
</p>
<p>for the immediate framing of a constitution and the as-
</p>
<p>sumption of independence, which the letter of Brown
</p>
<p>also contemplated and urged, as the first step necessary to
</p>
<p>the consummation of the arrangements " he had discussed
</p>
<p>with" Gardoqui. With a dift'erent view of his obliga-
</p>
<p>tions, to say nothing of his reluctance to engage in con-
</p>
<p>troversy, the amiable and cautious Muter would not assent
</p>
<p>to the publication ; but he did cheerfully and promptly
</p>
<p>consent to unite with Colonel Marshall in a determined
</p>
<p>effort to counteract and defeat the clandestine designs
</p>
<p>they both now plainly discerned. Neither had been a
</p>
<p>member of the July convention,* but both determined to
</p>
<p>become candidates for seats in that called for !N"ovember,
</p>
<p>" and both took much pains to inform the people of the
</p>
<p>danger and unconstitutionality of the course to which they
</p>
<p>had been advised by the late convention." Associated with

<p>Wilkinson, Wallace, Innes and Sebastian, They brought
</p>
<p>to their aid the influence and popularity of Joseph Crock-
</p>
<p>ett, who was the fifth on their ticket;  a man who had
</p>
<p>borne the brunt in the very " fore front " of battle in the
</p>
<p>revolution, and who was not now found wanting when
</p>
<p>domestic treason had to be confronted. The four soldiers
</p>
<p>and the pedagogue * announced themselves for another
</p>
<p>application to Virginia, for separation, but only by legal
</p>
<p>and temperate measures. Wilkinson and Wallace advo-
</p>
<p>cated the same rash and precipitate course which they had
</p>
<p>urged in the July convention. The public debates were
</p>
<p>most animated. While Muter would not publish Brown's
</p>
<p>letter, he spoke of it to others besides Colonel Marshall,
</p>
<p>and among others with whom it was discussed were un-
</p>
<p>doubtedly Edwards, Crockett, Allen and Brooks. And
</p>
<p>under date of October 15, 1788, there was published in
</p>
<p>the Lexington Gazette, the following address, which was
</p>
<p>signed by Muter, and which had previously received the
</p>
<p>approval of Colonel Marshall, with whom it had been
</p>
<p>concerted, and to whom it was attributed by contempo-
</p>
<p>rary opinion, viz :
</p>
<p>" Forming a constitution of government, and organizing the same, be-
</p>
<p>fore the consent of the legislature of Virginia for that purpose first ob-
</p>
<p>tained, will be directly contrary to the letter and spirit of the act of
</p>
<p>assembly, entitled ' an act for punishing certain offenses ; and vesting
</p>
<p>the governor with certain powers ; ' which declares that every person or
</p>
<p>persons who shall erect or establish government separate from, or inde-
</p>
<p>pendent of the State of Virginia within the limits thereof, unless by act
</p>
<p>of the legislature for that purpose first obtained ; or shall exercise any
</p>
<p>office under such usurped government, shall be guilty of high treason.
</p>
<p>The third section of the fourth article of the federal constitution ex-
</p>
<p>pressly declares : ' that no new state shall be formed, or erected within
</p>
<p>the jurisdiction of any other state ; nor any state be formed out of the
</p>
<p>junction of two, or more states without the consent of the legislature of

</p>
<p>the states concerned, as well as of the Congress.' Therefore the con-
</p>
<p>sent of Virginia to the separation must first be obtained agreeably to
</p>
<p>the above-cited section, to afford to Kentucky any prospect of being ad-
</p>
<p>mitted a member of the Federal Union.
</p>
<p>In the tenth section of the first article of the federal constitution it
</p>
<p>is declared : ' that no state shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or con-

</p>
<p>federation.' Of coui'se it must follow that no part of a state can enter
</p>
<p>into any treaty, alliance, or confederation.
</p>
<p>The resolution of the late convention if adopted by the people, might
</p>
<p>fairly be construed, to give authority to the next to treat with Spain, to
</p>
<p>obtain the navigation of the Mississippi if they should think such a
</p>
<p>measure conducive to their interest when it might plainl}' appear by
</p>
<p>the before-recited section, that any other application than to the as-
</p>
<p>sembly of Virginia, and to the Congress of the United States, must be
</p>
<p>contrary to the federal constitution.
</p>
<p>It is therefore submitted to the consideration of the inhabitants of
</p>
<p>Fayette, whether it may not be necessary in their instructions to their
</p>
<p>delegates, to direct them not to agree to forming a constitution and form
</p>
<p>of government and organizing the same, till the consent of the legisla-
</p>
<p>ture of Virginia, for that purpose, is first obtained, not to agree to make
</p>
<p>any application whatever to obtain the navigation of the Mississippi,
</p>
<p>other than to the legislature of Virginia, and the Congress of the
</p>
<p>United States, to draw up and forward to the assembly of Virginia, a
</p>
<p>memorial requesting them to alter their acts for the separation of this
</p>
<p>district from Virginia, that the same be brought before the Congress of
</p>
<p>the United States, in the manner directed by the federal constitution,
</p>
<p>and to request them to authorize the convention by law, to form a con-
</p>
<p>stitution of government, and to organize the same ; or direct a new con-
</p>
<p>vention to be chosen, to continue in office a reasonable time, and to be
</p>
<p>vested with those powers.
</p>
<p>To forward to the assembly of Virginia, and the Congress of the
</p>
<p>United States (if they judge proper and necessary) a decent and manly
</p>
<p>memorial requesting that such measures may be pursued by Congress,
</p>
<p>or that Virginia, will use her influence with Congress to take such
</p>
<p>measures as shall be most likely to procure for the people of the western

<p>country, the navigation of the Mississippi.

<p>argument." But, while not deigning to place it before
</p>
<p>his readers, that they might form their own estimate of its

<p>value. Colonel Brown did not deem it beneath the dignity
</p>
<p>of his pages to embrace the occasion afforded by its con-
</p>
<p>temptuous mention to repeat his misstatement of facts in
</p>
<p>order to convict Muter and Marshall of inconsistency.
</p>
<p>Thus : " It does not appear what caused this change of

<p>opinion, and induced such strong opposition to the identi-
</p>
<p>cal measures that had commanded their [Muter and Mar-
</p>
<p>shall's] support and oote in the convention of the preceding

</p>
<p>July ;" *  which the letters of Muter himself, as well as
</p>
<p>every other record, show to be absolutely untrue as ap-
</p>
<p>phecl to him, not only as to his having given the vote
</p>
<p>stated, but as to his having been a mem]jer of the conven-
</p>
<p>tion at all. And which is shown by the sworn testimony
</p>
<p>of Greenup, which Colonel Brown read and which he
</p>
<p>suppressed, as v/ell as by the written statement of Crockett,
</p>
<p>to be equally untrue as to Marshall having given the vote
</p>
<p>in question ; and by the statement of Humphrey Marshall,
</p>
<p>as well as by the fact that Wilkinson, Wallace, Ward,
</p>
<p>Allen and Brooks were the jive members of the July con-
</p>
<p>vention from Fayette, to be as absolutely untrue as to
</p>
<p>Marshall having been a member of that convention. The
</p>
<p>pages of the Littell pamphlet, the entire record of the
</p>
<p>controversy which raged in 1806, will be searched in vain
</p>
<p>for an authority for this misstatement, which originated
</p>
<p>with, and all the honor and glory of which belongs exclu-
</p>
<p>sively to, the author of" The Political Beginnings."
</p>
<p>Having thus misstated the facts concerning the votes
</p>
<p>of Muter and Marshall in a convention of which neither
</p>
<p>was a member, it is rather a matter of surprise that Col-
</p>
<p>onel Brown hesitated to charge openly what he insinuates,
</p>
<p>that in their subsequent opposition, in the canvass preced-
</p>
<p>ing the November convention, to the plans of Wilkinson,
</p>

<p>character of the construction here given to the actions of
</p>
<p>Wilkinson and Wallace and their followers in the July
</p>
<p>convention, or to point out that there was no honest pur-
</p>
<p>pose in their advocacy of an " immediate framing of a con-
</p>
<p>stitution," and by a separation from Virginia and the as-
</p>
<p>sumption of sovereignty, without a law to that end, to ob-
</p>
<p>tain the " admission of Kentucky to the Union." The real
</p>
<p>design of all this is seen in the letters of Wilkinson to
</p>
<p>Miro, in the dispatch of Gardoqui, and in the letter of
</p>
<p>Brown. It must be admitted, however, that, if the allega-
</p>
<p>tions of Colonel Brown concerning the conduct of Muter
</p>
<p>and Marshall in that convention, of their sudden change
</p>
<p>after an interview with and a proposition made to them
</p>
<p>by Connolly, were true, then their course would have been

</p>
<p>very, very strange, that the reader would find it ditficult,
</p>
<p>if not impossible, to reconcile that conduct with any as-
</p>
<p>sumption that Muter and Marshall were either honest or
</p>
<p>patriotic men ; and that was precisely the view of their
</p>
<p>alleged conduct which Colonel Brown sought to convey.
</p>
<p>But when it is ascertained that neither Muter nor Mar-
</p>
<p>shall voted as alleged, nor was a member of that conven-
</p>
<p>tion ; that the letter of Brown to Muter was not received
</p>
<p>until the fall ; that neither ever saw Connolly until after
</p>
<p>the November convention; and that all this distinctly ap-
</p>
<p>pears in the evidence which Colonel Brown garbles and
</p>
<p>suppresses;  the reader will cease to wonder at the
</p>
<p>"strangeness" of the alleged inconsistencies of Muter and
</p>
<p>Marshall, and lose himself in admiration for the wonder-
</p>
<p>ful creative and constructive genius and amazing hardi-
</p>
<p>hood of Colonel Brown !

<p>ence of similar arguments the militia officers of Fayette

<p>effected a meeting, at which moderate resolutions were
</p>
<p>adopted to tranquillize the public excitement. General

</p>
<p>standing the deceits resorted to, he and his four associates

<p>on the ticket with him, Caleb Wallace, William Ward^
</p>
<p>Robert Johnson and Scott, were, on the fourth day of the
</p>
<p>election in the latter days of October, left far behind.
</p>
<p>Finding himself and all his ticket about to be beaten,
</p>
<p>Wilkinson then disclaimed all disorganizing designs, and
</p>
<p>gave public assurances that he would be guided by the
</p>
<p>wishes and instructions of the people ;  though all the time
</p>
<p>he held firmly to his purpose and engagement with the
</p>
<p>Spaniard. Personally popular as he was, these pledges
</p>
<p>enabled him to secure his own election, by a small vote,

</p>
<p>feated, and Colonel Marshall, Colonel Crockett, Judge
</p>
<p>Muter and the staunch John Allen, of the opposing ticket,
</p>
<p>were elected.* Unfortunately for his own reputation, the

<p>necessities of Muter, his helplessness if thrown out of
</p>
<p>office and his consequent cringing eflbrts to conciliate men
</p>
<p>who held his future and means of livelihood in their hands,
</p>
<p>drove him in later years to equivocation and self stultifi-
</p>

</p>
<p>demanded from him plain and manly speech. But the
</p>
<p>danger to his country had then apparently passed away,
</p>
<p>and only the reputation of those whom he sought to shield
</p>
<p>were at stake. And, besides, from under all the rubbish
</p>
<p>of his tergiversation enough of truth appeared to prevent
</p>
<p>any one from being deceived. To his praise it must always
</p>
<p>be remembered, that when real danger threatened his
</p>
<p>country he acted a manly and an unselfish part, and that

<p>so amiable, so cautious, so reluetant to wound, so averse
</p>
<p>to controversy of any kind, was driven by his sense of
</p>
<p>public danger to take a position so decided and aggressive,
</p>
<p>manifests the depth and seriousness of his apprehensions,
</p>
<p>and exhibits the nature he ascribed to the schemes of John
</p>
<p>Brown, as revealed in Brown's letter.
</p>
<p>In other portions of the district there was less agitation
</p>
<p>than there was in Fayette ; the same members wdio sat in
</p>
<p>the July convention were generally chosen to tliat of I^o-
</p>
<p>vember.
</p>
<p>It has been seen, that when John Brown " discussed
</p>
<p>with " Gardoqui the overture of the latter, he " expected "
</p>
<p>the convention of July '' would resolve upon the erection
</p>
<p>of an independent state," as one of the results of his let-
</p>
<p>ters, and that this initiatory step would be taken during
</p>
<p>his absence ; and in anticipation thereof, he told the Span-
</p>
<p>iard, that upon his return home he would " inform " his
</p>
<p>constituents of the Spanish oifer, and " aid'' in securing
</p>
<p>its acceptance. He announced the same purpose to Oliver
</p>
<p>Pollock. But, when he returned to the district in Septem-
</p>
<p>ber, he was disappointed to find Wallace's resolution de-
</p>
<p>feated in the convention, Kentucky still a part of Virginia
</p>
<p>and in the Union, and was confronted by the formidable
</p>
<p>opposition to the whole scheme of an illegal separation,
</p>
<p>and to all the sequela thereto, which had been boldly and
</p>
<p>energetically made by Muter, Marshall, Allen and Crock-
</p>
<p>ett in Fayette, by Edwards in Bourbon, by Anderson in
</p>
<p>Jefferson, and by good and true men in other portions of
</p>
<p>the district. Essentially a man of suppressions, conceal-
</p>
<p>ments and evasions, deliberate, cold blooded and self-seek-
</p>

</p>
<p>he wrote other letters than those addressed to McDowell

<p>and Muter is established by Muter's statement of his per-

<p>sonal kiiowk'dge of such otlier letters. That daring the
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 217
</p>
<p>canvass preceding the N'ovember convention, he did all in
</p>
<p>his power to incense the people against Congress, by im-
</p>
<p>peaching the sincerity and good faith of, and attributing
</p>
<p>unfriendly motives to the action of, that body, as he
</p>
<p>had done in those letters, is apparent from the letter of
</p>
<p>Ebenezer Brooks already quoted. * To Christopher
</p>
<p>Greenup he communicated the overture of Gardoqui
</p>
<p>which he had promised to " aid." Greenup being opposed
</p>
<p>to the entire scheme, from its initial point of an illegal
</p>
<p>separation from Virginia to its intended culmination in an
</p>
<p>alliance with Spain, the prudent Brown forbore to advo-
</p>
<p>cate its acceptance to him. f With his intimate and
</p>
<p>leader, General Wilkinson, he was less reserved, as ap-
</p>
<p>pears from a letter of that conspirator to Miro, under date
</p>
<p>* Brooks wrote : " Our member of Congress seems much outof humor
</p>
<p>that he has been so little attended to in the controversy. They seem to
</p>
<p>think Congress sincere notwithstanding all he has written to the con-
</p>
<p>trary." [Letter of Arthur Campbell, dated October 25, 1788 ; published
</p>
<p>in the " Western World " in 1806.]
</p>
<p>t Greenup, who was then governor, had been understood to say that
</p>
<p>when Brown communicated to him the overture of Gardoqui, he com-
</p>
<p>menced to advocate it in a feeble sort of way, but, on finding Greenup
</p>
<p>hostile, desisted. There was more than one person who so understood
</p>
<p>Greenup, who did not expect to be reported, and who denied the state-
</p>
<p>ment as published in the Western World. From his letter, however, it
</p>
<p>appears that Brown did make to him the stated communication, as he
</p>
<p>almost certainly did to all to whom he believed it safe to do so.
</p>
<p>Greenup's letter is as follows, viz :
</p>
<p>To the Editors of the Western World :
</p>
<p>From the conversation I had with you on the evening of the day on
</p>
<p>which the first number of your paper appeared, I did expect, from your
</p>

<p>self, concerning IMr. Brown and others. Understanding that you are
</p>
<p>not likely to do so, I tliink proper to declare, that I did not in that con-
</p>
<p>versation say that Mr. Brown " in a guarded manner approved " of Gar-
</p>
<p>doqui's proposition, or any words like it. JMr. Brown merely related
</p>
<p>Gardoqui's conversation with him  neither approving nor disapproving
</p>
<p>the same. That I did not say General Wilkinson's memorial contained
</p>
<p>about eighty pages. But I did say, and do now say that I knew nothing
</p>
<p>of the individuals who were to fill the several places of honor under the
</p>
<p>Spanish government in Kentucky, but by the information of the late
</p>
<p>Colonel Marshall. At the time Mr. Wood spoke to me on the above

</p>
<p>known the proposition of Gardoqui in all its deform-
</p>
<p>ity, as well as his own adherence to the scheme and
</p>
<p>desire that it should be successful ; and Wilkinson dis-
</p>
<p>covered his knowledge of the man in ascribing Brown's
</p>
<p>refusal to openly advocate a scheme to which he was pri-
</p>
<p>vately devoted, to his timidity, and to an apprehension
</p>
<p>that a public disclosure of the proposition would defeat
</p>
<p>rather than further its acceptance. The letter of Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson also makes it clear, that in the mutual confidences
</p>
<p>between Brown and himself he disclosed to the Congress-
</p>
<p>man the arrangement he had effected with Miro ; and the
</p>
<p>subsequent actions of the two friends in the approaching
</p>
<p>convention can best be understood by looking at them
</p>
<p>under the light of those official explanations of the bold
</p>
<p>man whose superior nerve made him the leader. It is in
</p>
<p>the highest degree improbable that John Brown did not
</p>
<p>communicate it to others besides Greenup and Wilkinson;

<p>subject I had not seeu the statement of the propositions alleged to have
</p>
<p>been made by Gardoqui to Mr. Brown, and, therefore, could not say

<p>that his conversation with me corresponded with them. I now say it

<p>did not.

<p>inform these two, one of whom was then the confidential

<p>John Brown arrived in Kentucky in time to participate
</p>
<p>in the canvass, to become a candidate for, and to secure his
</p>
<p>own election to, a seat in the November convention. The
</p>
<p>meager official report of the proceedings of that body, as
</p>
<p>made by Thomas Todd, conveys no adequate conception of
</p>
<p>the issues which were presented, of the sentiments and pur-
</p>
<p>poses by which the opposing parties were animated, nor
</p>
<p>of the heated discussions which ensued. It states that on
</p>
<p>the first day, Mpuday, November 3, 1788, there was no
</p>
<p>quorum. On Tuesday, Samuel McDowell was again chosen
</p>
<p>to preside, and Thomas Todd to officiate as secretary. It
</p>
<p>was then determined that on the next day the convention
</p>
<p>would itself go into a committee of the whole, to consider
</p>
<p>the state of the district. To this committee were referred
</p>
<p>the resolutions of Congress upon the application of the dis-
</p>
<p>trict, which those resolutions had referred to the new gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, that had been established by the ratification of
</p>
<p>the constitution by ten states. On the third day, those
</p>
<p>resolutions and other papers referring to the same subject
</p>
<p>were referred to the committee of the whole, of which
</p>
<p>Wilkinson was elected chairman. After the committee
</p>
<p>had deliberated for some time it rose, but with leave to sit

<p>again during the day. The convention then referred to

<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 221
</p>
<p>the committee the resolutions of the July convention, rec-
</p>
<p>ommending the election of, and giving powers to, this con-
</p>
<p>vention ;" after which the convention again went into the
</p>
<p>committee of the whole, which occupied further time in
</p>
<p>deliberation, and then rose, to sit again from day to day.
</p>
<p>Petitions were then presented from the counties of Mercer
</p>
<p>and of Madison respectively, praying the convention " that
</p>
<p>a spirited and manly address should be sent to Congress, to
</p>
<p>obtain the navigation of the Mississippi," which was also
</p>
<p>referred to the committee. The resolution for preparing
</p>
<p>an address to the Assembly of Virginia was then taken
</p>
<p>up, read, amended and agreed to, as follows, viz :
</p>
<p>" That a committee be appointed to draw up a decent and respectful
</p>
<p>address to the assembly of Virginia, for obtaining the independence of
</p>
<p>Kentucky, agreeable to the late resolution and recommendation of Con-
</p>
<p>gress, and that they prepare and report the same to the convention to-
</p>
<p>morrow."
</p>
<p>The committee appointed consisted of Edwards, Mar-
</p>
<p>shall, Muter, Jouitt, Allen and Wilkinson, the first of
</p>
<p>whom had offered, and the second of whom had seconded,
</p>
<p>the resolution.
</p>
<p>On the fourth day, the resolution reported from the
</p>
<p>committee of the whole upon the petitions from Madison
</p>
<p>and Mercer was recommitted to the committee of the
</p>
<p>whole, into which the convention then resolved itself, and
</p>
<p>of which Innes was elected chairman. After the subject
</p>
<p>had been discussed for some time, the committee reported
</p>
<p>to the convention that the petitions were reasonable, and
</p>
<p>the convention- ordered that a decent and respectful ad-
</p>
<p>dress to Congress be prepared accordingly. The special

<p>committee appointed for the purpose consisted of Innes,

<p>to separate from the State of Virginia, and that the same be erected into

<p>the call upon John Brown for information as to the over-
</p>
<p>ture of Gardoqui, nor of any discussion between the par-
</p>
<p>ties, and conveys not even an intimation that the question
</p>
<p>of the navigation of the Mississippi was before the con-
</p>
<p>vention, except so far as the petitions from Madison and
</p>
<p>Mercer, and the resolution that an address should be sent
</p>
<p>to Congress to obtain it for the district, brought it before
</p>
<p>them ;  which, in fact, conceals nearly all the reader is in-
</p>
<p>terested in knowing.
</p>
<p>The important truth, which that report conceals, is,
</p>
<p>that on the third day, after the convention had resolved
</p>
<p>itself into the committee of the whole, with the resolu-
</p>
<p>tions of Congress and the question whether the advice of
</p>
<p>that body should be followed as the only subjects before
</p>
<p>the committee for consideration ;  there at once ensued a
</p>
<p>discussion as to what powers were possessed by the conven-
</p>
<p>tion, and v)hence those powers were derived. By Muter,
</p>
<p>Marshall, Edwards, Allen and Crockett it was contended,
</p>
<p>that the only power the convention had was the right of
</p>
<p>petition, to apply to the assembly of Virginia for an act
</p>
<p>authorizing the district to form a constitution, and con-
</p>
<p>senting to its independence. By Wilkinson, Brown,
</p>
<p>Innes and Sebastian it was argued, that the convention had
</p>
<p>all the sovereign powers which the recommendatory reso-
</p>
<p>lutions of the July convention had advised the people to

</p>
<p>bestow upon their representatives ; and that those powers
</p>
<p>embraced the forming of a constitution, the declaration of
</p>
<p>independence, the assumption of sovereignty, without an
</p>
<p>application to Virginia, the navigation of the Mississippi,
</p>
<p>and all those sweeping and unlimited powers of doing
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 223
</p>
<p>any thing and every thing which they might deem con-
</p>
<p>ducive to the interests of the district. It was during this
</p>
<p>debate it was discovered, that the resolutions of the July
</p>
<p>convention had not been referred to the committee. A
</p>
<p>motion was therefore made, that the committee rise, in
</p>
<p>order that the reference might be made by the convention
</p>
<p>to the people. To this opposition was made by Muter
</p>
<p>and Marshall and their associates, who held that the
</p>
<p>question of applying to Virginia (which was the sole thing
</p>
<p>the convention had power to do, as they contended,) w^as
</p>
<p>fully before the committee, and should be considered sepa-
</p>
<p>rately from the others. But the Wilkinson coterie were
</p>
<p>determined, that this question should be complicated with
</p>
<p>that of the navigation of the great river. They succeeded
</p>
<p>in having the committee rise, and then in securing the
</p>
<p>reference by the convention of the resolutions of the July
</p>
<p>convention to the committee of the whole. It was certainly
</p>
<p>at some time during the third or fourth day, and most
</p>
<p>probably during the debate on the question of reference, as
</p>
<p>Marshall, McClung and Butler concur in stating, that the
</p>
<p>most memorable utterances of Wilkinson and Brown were
</p>
<p>delivered, glancing at the idea of an illegal separation, as
</p>
<p>a step towards obtaining the na.vigation of the Mississippi,
</p>
<p>and yet doing it in a manner evincing their doubts of the
</p>
<p>sentiments of their auditors, and their apprehensions of
</p>
<p>the consequences of open avowals of their purposes.
</p>
<p>By the master spirit of the intriguants, by Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>who had made with Miro the arrangements disclosed in
</p>
<p>their letters, it was said in the convention, that :
</p>
<p>" Spain had objections to granting the navigation in question to the
</p>
<p>United States ; it was not to be presumed that Congress would obtain
</p>
<p>it for Kentucky, or even the western country  her treaties must be gen-
</p>
<p>eral. There was one way, and but one, that he knew of obviating
</p>
<p>these difficulties, and that was so fortified by constitutions, and guarded

<p>by laws, that it was dangerous of access, and hopeless of attainment
</p>
<p>under present circumstances. It was the certain but prescribed course
</p>
<p>which had been indicated in the former convention, which he would
</p>
<p>not now repeat ; but which every gentleman present would connect
</p>
<p>with the formation of a constitution, a declaration of independence and
</p>
<p>the organization of a new state ; which, he added, might safely be left

</p>
<p>to find its way into the Union on terms advantageous to its interests and
</p>
<p>prosperity. *
</p>
<p>Wilkinson continued to dwell upon the value and im-
</p>
<p>portance of the navigation, upon the inability of Congress
</p>
<p>to obtain the privilege of that navigation, and renewed his
</p>
<p>insinuation that Kentucky could obtain it for herself by
</p>
<p>taking the indicated step ;  making exactly the speech
</p>
<p>which a man would naturally make who had formed with
</p>
<p>Miro an engagement to separate Kentucky from the
</p>
<p>Union, and yet who was warned by the expressions of
</p>
<p>those who listened that the ground on which he trod was
</p>
<p>dangerous. In conclusion he stated, that important infor-
</p>
<p>mation on the subject was within the power of the con-
</p>
<p>vention, and he doubted not it would be agreeable to the
</p>
<p>gentleman who possessed it to communicate that informa-
</p>
<p>tion. All eyes were directed upon John Brown, who was
</p>
<p>well understood to be the person to whom Wilkinson had
</p>
<p>referred ; and " a member of the convention then desired
</p>
<p>Mr. Brown to communicate what he knew, f In reply to
</p>
<p>which invitation Mr. Brown, according to the statement
</p>
<p>of Colonel Thomas Marshall, an eye and ear witness,
</p>
<p>given in a letter to General Washington, dated February
</p>
<p>12, 1789, only three months subsequent to the occurrence,
</p>
<p>said :
</p>
<p>" He told us that he did not think himself at liberty to mention what
</p>
<p>had passed in private conversation between himself and Don Gardoqui
</p>
<p>respecting us ; but this much he would venture to inform us, that pro-
</p>
<p>vided we were united in our councils every thing we could wish for was
</p>
<p>within our reach."
</p>
<p>* Marshall, page 318. Butler, copying this from Marshall's History,
</p>
<p>adds his supposition that it was taken from " the notes of Colonel
</p>
<p>Thomas Marshall, whose accuracy in another part of this debate was
</p>
<p>vouched for by Judge Thomas Todd, when summoned before a legisla-
</p>
<p>tive committee in 1806." Whether or not this supposition is correct, it

<p>is certain that Humphrey Marshall had ample opportunity for ascertain-
</p>
<p>ing the facts accurately, not only from Colonel Thomas Marshall, but
</p>
<p>from Muter, Edwards, Allen, Crockett, Anderson and others. That
</p>
<p>Wilkinson made a speech in reference to this subject, and hinting at the
</p>
<p>terms on which it might be obtained, is certain. That much appears in

</p>
<p>Upon this reply made by John Brown to the request,
</p>
<p>that he would communicate to the convention what he
</p>
<p>knew as to the terms upon which the freedom of the nav-
</p>
<p>igation of the Mississippi might be obtained by the people
</p>
<p>of Kentucky, Colonel Marshall, who had read Brown's
</p>
<p>letter to Muter, and clearly understood the full meaning
</p>
<p>of Brown's hesitating and cautious words, made this natu-
</p>
<p>ral comment : " Meaning, as it fully appeared to me, that
</p>
<p>if we would assume government and declare separate from
</p>
<p>the Union, Spain would give us Qxery indulgence we could
</p>
<p>ask for."
</p>
<p>Having thus admitted his own private conferences with
</p>
<p>Gardoqui, confirmed what Wilkinson had said in regard
</p>
<p>to the information he possessed, and given the convention
</p>
<p>distinctly to understand, that they had only to act with
</p>
<p>unanimity to obtain from Spain all they desired, the cir-
</p>
<p>cumspect Mr. Brown plumped himself down into his seat,
</p>
<p>and at this time not another word did he utter. If Wilk-
</p>
<p>inson, Sebastian, Innes, and Wallace (who was a spectator,
</p>
<p>though not a member of the convention), hoped that he
</p>
<p>would openly advocate in that presence the scheme con-
</p>
<p>cerning which he had promised Gardoqui to " inform "
</p>
<p>his constituents and to " aid " in its accomplishment ; or
</p>
<p>even that he would impart explicit information which
</p>
<p>might be useful in its details, they were, as their looks and
</p>
<p>manner indicated, sorely disappointed. When about to
</p>
<p>take the leap the horse had balked. Whether the oppo-
</p>
<p>sition, that had already been made in the preceding can-
</p>
<p>vass, had made him fear the consequences upon his own
</p>
<p>future of a more explicit declaration had daunted him,
</p>
<p>and had caused him to predetermine.^ this laconic and
</p>
<p>oracular response ; or whether, wdien he rose to make the
</p>
<p>statement his confederates evidently expected from him,
</p>
<p>he was disconcerted by the expression of reprehension

</p>
<p>and of keen scrutiny he detected on the countenances of
</p>
<p>many of his auditors, it is needless to inquire. It is only
</p>
<p>important for the present purpose the reader shall note,
</p>
<p>that this was the plea which John Brown made for unani-
</p>
<p>mity, and that this was " the unanimity which John Brown
</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>226 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>invoked in the convention of November." * It was not,
</p>
<p>as his grandson most strangely represents, to adopt a con-
</p>
<p>stitution in order that an immediate application might be
</p>
<p>made to Congress to admit Kentucky into the Union ;  for,
</p>
<p>equally in his secret letters and in his commingling vs^ith
</p>
<p>the x^eople, he had represented that Congress to be insin-
</p>
<p>cere, treacherous and hostile. But it was, that they should
</p>
<p>be unanimous in separating from Virginia and from the
</p>
<p>United States, in order to profit by the overture of Gar-
</p>
<p>doqui, the benefits of which, he had himself written, could
</p>
<p>only be obtained by a withdrawal from the United States.
</p>
<p>The man so correctly described by his friend Wilkinson
</p>
<p>to Miro, could not, unless b}' a sudden transformation of
</p>
<p>his own essential nature, when confronted by so many
</p>
<p>looks of scorn and of anger, have made a more explicit
</p>
<p>statement, that if the convention would only erect itself
</p>
<p>into an independent state and separate from the Union,
</p>
<p>Spain was ready to grant to the new state, thus independ-
</p>
<p>ent and separate, every privilege of navigation and com-
</p>
<p>merce her people could desire;  which privilege, he had
</p>
<p>written to Muter, could never be granted so long as they
</p>
<p>remained a part of the United States.
</p>
<p>The dead silence that followed was broken by Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son, who sought to revive the spirits of his adherents by
</p>
<p>reading to the convention the memorial to the Intendant
</p>
<p>of Louisiana, which he had concocted with ISTavarro and
</p>
<p>Miro at New Orleans. It has been seen that the original
</p>
<p>of this memorial had been forwarded to Madrid, where, to-
</p>
<p>gether with the representations of Navarro and Miro, it
</p>
<p>had produced the instructions to Gardoqui, acting under
</p>
<p>which the overture to John Brown was made. The sub-
</p>
<p>stance of that memorial, as read in the convention, was
</p>
<p>stated by Colonel Marshall in his letter to Washington
</p>
<p>(of February 12, 1789), the accuracy of which statement

</p>
<p>was vouched for under oath by Judge Todd, the secretary
</p>
<p>of the convention, and relative and protege of Innes. In
</p>
<p>plain and unequivocal terms, the memorial stated, that

</p>
<p>" the western people were on the point of separating them-
</p>
<p>selves from the Union forever," because of intelligence
</p>
<p>that Congress was about to cede to Spain the navigation
</p>
<p>of the Mississippi for twenty-five or thirty years. It
</p>
<p>threatened Spain, that, in case she refused the use of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi to the western people (thus separated) Great
</p>
<p>Britain stood with arms extended ready to receive them.
</p>
<p>It quoted a conversation the author of the memorial had
</p>
<p>held with a member of the British Parliament to that
</p>
<p>effect. As this memorial was read, the sheets were handed
</p>
<p>to Sebastian, who held possession of them for the author;
</p>
<p>they were not placed on the clerk's table, as was custom-
</p>
<p>ary with public papers.
</p>
<p>To counteract the eflect of these proceedings, the peti-
</p>
<p>tions which had been obtained from citizens of Mercer
</p>
<p>and Madison, praying- that an address might be sent to
</p>
<p>Congress to obtain the navigation of the Mississippi, were
</p>
<p>delivered to Innes, with the request that he would pre-
</p>
<p>sent them; which he did, knowing that the object prayed
</p>
<p>for was not within the power of Congress, and if the con-
</p>
<p>vention voted the address, the certain failure of Congress
</p>
<p>to comply would add to the discontent. These petitions,
</p>
<p>contemplating a constitutional course, met with no oppo-
</p>
<p>sition from the moderate party, and were referred to a
</p>
<p>special committee, who soon reported a preamble and res-
</p>
<p>olution, which was ordered to lie on the table. It was at
</p>
<p>this juncture that the resolution which had been ofiJered
</p>
<p>by Edwards and seconded by Marshall " for appointing a
</p>
<p>committee to draw up a decent and respectful address
</p>
<p>to the people of Virginia, for obtaining the independence
</p>
<p>of the district of Kentucky, agreeable to the late resolu-
</p>
<p>tions and recommendations of Congress," was called up
</p>
<p>and agreed to. This was the decisive action of the con-
</p>
<p>vention, which marked the spirit of loyalty and honor

<p>which was predominant in the convention, and gave
</p>
<p>warning to the men whose leaders had conspired with
</p>
<p>Miro and "discussed" treason with Gardoqui. The reso-
</p>
<p>lution for the preparation of this address was adopted in
</p>
<p>the moment of honest revulsion from the utterances of

</p>
<p>Wilkinson and Brown. Wilkinson was the only man
</p>
<p>of his party on the oommittec intrusted with its prepara-
</p>
<p>tion, and, though he endeavored by indirect mean^ to de-
</p>
<p>feat the address, he was too astute a politician to propose
</p>
<p>a different one, after having received an intimation so sat-
</p>
<p>isfactory to his ready perception of the loyal feeling of the
</p>
<p>convention.
</p>
<p>On the next day tlie petitions from Mercer and Madison
</p>
<p>were taken up and the special committee was appointed to
</p>
<p>prepare the address to Congress. Mr. Edwards then re-
</p>
<p>ported the address to the Assembly of Virginia; but an
</p>
<p>amendment was oftered for the purpose of delaying, and,
</p>
<p>if possible, of defeating it, and it was postponed for future
</p>
<p>consideration. The object was to make one more effort
</p>
<p>to bring the convention to immediately form a constitu-
</p>
<p>tion, to organize government, to declare the independence
</p>
<p>of the district, and to assume sovereignty, without an act
</p>
<p>of Virginia, which was the first step necessary in the
</p>
<p>schemes of Wilkinson and Brown. The convention was
</p>
<p>immediately asked to come to the resolution introduced
</p>
<p>for this purpose by John Brown. That this was its pur-
</p>
<p>pose was avowed in the Littell pamphlet and is conceded
</p>
<p>in the " Political Beginnings." The resolution was char-
</p>
<p>acteristically tortuous and misleading.* The first part of
</p>
<p>it, which embraced a separation from Virginia, and which
</p>
<p>was to have been immediate and without a law for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose, was the real object which was sought to be accom-
</p>
<p>plished by the resolution ; and it was in consonance with
</p>
<p>Brown's letter to Muter, with his promise to Gardoqui,
</p>
<p>with his laconic statement to the convention, when called
</p>
<p>on for information as to the means by which the naviga-
</p>
<p>tion of the Mississippi could be obtained, and with the
</p>
<p>*The following is the text of the official report, viz.:

<p>following resolution, viz.:

<p>" Resolved, That it is the wish and interest of the good people of the
</p>
<p>district to separate from the State of Virginia, and that the same be
</p>
<p>erected into an independent member of the Federal Union.

</p>
<p>hints that had been given by Wilkinson aa to the one
</p>
<p>thing necessary to be done in order to obtain that naviga-
</p>
<p>tion. The second part, mentioning the "erection of the
</p>
<p>district into an independent member of the Federal
</p>
<p>Union " was ont of the power of the convention itself to
</p>
<p>accomplish ;  while not only was the step suggested by the
</p>
<p>first part prohibited by the laws of Virginia, but the Arti-
</p>
<p>cles of Confederation and the Constitution, which had been
</p>
<p>adopted, equally prohibited Congress from receiving a
</p>
<p>State which had been "erected " in that manner. From
</p>
<p>its very nature this " erection into a member of the Fed-
</p>
<p>eral Union" was to have been future, remote and contin-
</p>
<p>gent, while the action proposed was calculated, as it was
</p>
<p>designed, to defeat that object. It was incorporated in
</p>
<p>the resolution by Mr. Brown, to bridge over its first part
</p>
<p>with those who would have halted if a i)roposition to ille-
</p>
<p>gally separate from A^irginia had been accompanied by an
</p>
<p>open declaration of a separation from the Union. Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson, wliose engagement with Miro has been seen, was
</p>
<p>actuated by the same policy when lie intimated, that the
</p>
<p>independent State to which Spain would grant the navi-
</p>
<p>gation of the Mississippi "might safely be left to find its
</p>
<p>way into the Union,'' at some unknown and indefinite
</p>
<p>time in the future ; though he and Brown Ijoth knew, that
</p>
<p>the condition annexed to the proposed tVivors of Spain was
</p>
<p>a final separation from the Union.
</p>
<p>When the statement of Littell's pamphlet, as to the ob-
</p>
<p>ject which John Brown sought to attain by his resolution,
</p>
<p>is logically connected with Brown's letter to Muter, with
</p>
<p>his promise to Gardoqui, with his mutual confidences
</p>
<p>with Wilkinson, and with the engagement of the latter with
</p>
<p>Miro, which he had made known to Brown, there remains
</p>
<p>no room for doubt, that the above statement of the pur-
</p>
<p>pose of Brown's resolution is just. In Chapter VI of that

<p>pamphlet it is stated, that when the address to the Assem-
</p>
<p>bly of Virginia was reported by John Edwards, " an
</p>
<p>amendment was proposed, and both that and the address
</p>
<p>were ordered to lie on the table. The reason of this was,
</p>
<p>that some objections liad been made to the substance of
</p>
<p>230 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>the address, and several me.nfihers disapproved of the proceed-
</p>
<p>ings in toto" Those " several members " were James Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson, John Brown, Benjamin Sebastian, and Harylnnes,
</p>
<p>and their folloAvers ; and the " proceedings " of which
</p>
<p>" they disapproved in toto,'' was the proposition to apply
</p>
<p>to the Assembly of Virginia for a law to authorize the
</p>
<p>separation, to consent to the erection of the district into
</p>
<p>a state, and to its reception into the Union, as provided in
</p>
<p>such cases by the Constitution. The action of Congress
</p>
<p>in referring the application of Kentucky to the new gov-
</p>
<p>ernment the pamphlet then ascribes " to the malign influ-
</p>
<p>ence of an Eastern politician, whose talents for intrigue
</p>
<p>have become famous throughout the civilized world."
</p>
<p>The pamphlet also states, that "A considerable time must
</p>
<p>elapse before the new Federal Government could come
</p>
<p>into operation, and experience had furnished them with
</p>
<p>no cause to believe that the protection of Kentucky would
</p>
<p>engross its earliest care. On the other hand there was
</p>
<p>much reason to fear that bartering away the navigation of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi would, he one of its first acts."" There was, then,
</p>
<p>no expectation or purpose to make an ^'' immediate applica-
</p>
<p>tion " for admission to the Union, as stated in the " Politi-
</p>
<p>cal Beginnings." Still, under the impression, as the pam-
</p>
<p>phlet alleges, that the bartering away of the navigation
</p>
<p>of the Mississippi would be one of t\\Q first acts of the new
</p>
<p>government, it was the opinion of Wilkinson, who had
</p>
<p>conspired with Miro to separate Kentucky from the Union
</p>
<p>and to subject her people to Spain; of John Brown, who
</p>
<p>had promised Gardoqni to return home and "aid" in pro-
</p>
<p>moting that separation in order to negotiate with Spain,
</p>
<p>and who knew Wilkinson's plans ; of Sebastian, who had
</p>

<p>ginia that this "Western country will, in a few years,
</p>
<p>Bevolt from the Union and erect itself into an independ-
</p>
<p>ent government," who was one of the first two men in
</p>
<p>Kentucky to whom Wilkinson had fully confided, who
</p>
<p>had read Brown's letter to McDowell, and to whom Brown
</p>
<p>The Spa?iish Conspiracy. 231
</p>
<p>had, beyond peradventure, communicated tlie details of
</p>
<p>his conference with Gardoqui ;  it was the opinion of this
</p>
<p>patriotic quadrilateral, according to tlieir own statement
</p>
<p>in Littell, "that it was the duty of the convention, under
</p>
<p>the powers delegated to them" by the recommendatory
</p>
<p>resolution of the July convention, "to proceed to form a
</p>
<p>constitution ; that measures should be taken to organize
</p>
<p>the district under it ; and as soon as the affairs of the gen-
</p>
<p>eral government would permit, Kentucky should present
</p>
<p>herself in that organized form (as an independent state)
</p>
<p>for admission into the Union, on the conditions contained
</p>
<p>in the compact with Virginia!" According to this state-
</p>
<p>ment, then, the object of the resolution was to immediately
</p>
<p>separate Kentucky from Virginia, and to erect the district
</p>
<p>at once into a state. This state would necessarily have
</p>
<p>been outside of the Union. One of the first acts of that
</p>
<p>Union, the pamphlet states, it was apprehended, would be
</p>
<p>to barter away the navigation of the Mississippi. There
</p>
<p>was no purpose, therefore, to apply at once for admission
</p>
<p>to a Union from which this action was feared. But at
</p>
<p>some future time, to be determined thereafter (and very
</p>
<p>distant that time would have been had Kentucky taken
</p>
<p>the fatal leap to which she was urged, and had her desti-
</p>
<p>nies been controlled by the men who had made such en-
</p>
<p>gagements with the Spaniard), that application might be
</p>
<p>made. In the meantime, however, Kentucky would have
</p>
<p>been out of the Union and free to forin alliances where
</p>
<p>she pleased.
</p>
<p>For these reasons, and under these impressions, Littell
</p>
<p>alleges the resolution of John Brown was offered. And
</p>
<p>after stating other arguments advanced why this resolution
</p>
<p>should be adopted, the author continues :
</p>
<p>"As a further iiKhicement to adopt this resohitiou, it was stated that
</p>
<p>there was a prospect of obtainiu'j from S^iit'in iHniii>i^hin to export the produce

</p>

</p>
<p>opinion on this matter."
</p>
<p>Then Littell gives the version of Wilkinson's speech,
</p>
<p>which it was supposed was best calculated to conceal the
</p>
<p>232 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>purposes which the reader knows Wilkinson had. Ilia
</p>
<p>information was derived from Brown and Innes, and, of
</p>
<p>course, the intimation given by Wilkinson of the only
</p>
<p>way in which Kentucky could obtain for herself what
</p>
<p>Congress could not secure, was carefully suppressed;  just
</p>
<p>as Innes suppressed in the same publication the words
</p>
<p>" Revolt from the Union" in his letter to Governor Ran-
</p>
<p>dolph, as Brown suppressed his letter to Muter, as the
</p>
<p>resolution of Wallace in the July convention was sup-
</p>
<p>pressed, and just as these three men had combined to sup-
</p>
<p>press the fact that they had signed the letter which in-
</p>
<p>duced the censure of Clark. The fact is mentioned by
</p>
<p>Littell that Wilkinson read his memorial to the Intcndant
</p>
<p>of Louisiana, and compliments are passed upon its ability
</p>
<p>and style. And then comes this remarkable passage :
</p>
<p>"This communication (the memorial,) brought to recollection infor-
</p>
<p>mation received by the president of the convention on the same subject
</p>
<p>in a letter written by John Brown, while in Congress, after the applica-
</p>
<p>tion of Kentucky to that body had been defeated as hereinbefore men-
</p>
<p>tioned. A motion was then made that the president request Mr. Brown,
</p>
<p>(who was then a member of the convention) to make such communica-
</p>
<p>tion on the subject, as he should think proper. 3fr. Brown then stated in a
</p>
<p>concise 7nanner the substance of what he had loritten to Colonel McDowell. But
</p>
<p>in doing this he merely made a naked statement of the conversation,
</p>
<p>without recommending the adojition of any measure in consequence of
</p>
<p>it, or suggesting a single sentiment of approbation."
</p>
<p>It has been seen, however, that the " prospect of obtain-
</p>
<p>ing from Spain permission to export the produce of the
</p>
<p>country by way of the Mississippi" was "a further in-
</p>
<p>ducement to adopt " Mr. Brown's resolution, which was
</p>
<p>understood to be, and was designed by its author as, a
</p>
<p>step for the realization of that prospect. The reader will
</p>
<p>note the peculiarity of the assertion in the above extract,
</p>
<p>that " Mr. Brown then stated in a concise manner the sub-

</p>
<p>stance of what he had written to Colonel McDowell ;"  which
</p>
<p>omitted the fact that Spain's condition, on which alone she
</p>
<p>would grant that navigation to Kentucky, was that the
</p>
<p>district must Jirst withdraw from the Union. Then, observ-
</p>
<p>ing the pretense in the authorized statement made by Lit-
</p>
<p>tell, that the realization of the " prospect " held out by
</p>
<p>Spain for obtaining that navigation was consistent with a
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 233
</p>
<p>future application for admission to the Union, he will be
</p>
<p>able to fully appreciate the motive John Brown and Hary
</p>
<p>Innes had for suppressing the letter written to Muter, and
</p>
<p>for falsely stating that it gave the same account of the
</p>
<p>proposition of Gardoqui as that given in the letter to Mc-
</p>
<p>Dowell ; and in arriving at this appreciation of the de-
</p>
<p>fense thus offered, he will comprehend the characters of
</p>
<p>the men and the nature of their cause.
</p>
<p>If John Brown had in truth detailed to the convention
</p>
<p>the proposition of Gardoqui as he had stated it to Mc-
</p>
<p>Dowell, leaving the convention to suppose that Spain had
</p>
<p>offered to grant the navigation to Kentucky as a memher
</p>
<p>of the Federal Union, it would have heen but an additional
</p>
<p>evidence of his duplicity and of his perfidy.
</p>
<p>In Chapter X of Littell appears this passage : " But in
</p>
<p>the convention of ISTovember, 178'8, Mr. Brown made a
</p>
<p>public communication of his conference with Gardoqui,
</p>
<p>in the presence of honest simplicity, wary jealousy and
</p>
<p>suspicious duplicity. In the hearing of confidential
</p>
<p>friends and insinuating hypocrites, of open rivals and se-
</p>
<p>cret enemies." And a little further on in the same chapter
</p>
<p>the statement is again repeated that Brown reported to
</p>
<p>the convention his conference with Gardoqui. The reader
</p>
<p>will see from the letter to Muter and from Gardoqui's
</p>
<p>official dispatch, that, in that conference, Gardoqui made a
</p>
<p>distinct proposition to Brown to grant Kentucky the navi-
</p>
<p>gation of the Mississippi on the fundamental condition
</p>
<p>precedent that Kentucky would erect itself into an inde-
</p>
<p>pendent state and separate fi-om the Union; and that
</p>
<p>Brown thanked Gardoqui for making that proposition,
</p>
<p>promised to " aid" in promoting its acceptance, and urged
</p>
<p>in the convention that the initial of measures necessary to
</p>
<p>secure that navigation under that proposition should be
</p>
<p>taken. There is no one so simple as to believe that the men

</p>
<p>who favored a separation from the Union in order to obtain
</p>
<p>that concession from Spain, contemplated the abandon-
</p>
<p>ment of the advantage it would have conferred by a sub-
</p>
<p>sequent application for admission back into the Union !
</p>
<p>If Brown's own statement through Littell is to be be-
</p>
<p>234 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>lieved, he stated to the convention the overture which
</p>
<p>Gardoqui had made ; though in that presence he did not
</p>
<p>dare to advocate it. He did not claim that he had lisped
</p>
<p>one word in opposition to the proposition of treason which
</p>
<p>he alleged he had then communicated. While men were
</p>
<p>still living who were present and had heard all that was
</p>
<p>said, even he was ashamed to deny that the subject was
</p>
<p>mentioned in the convention, or that he had spoken in ref-
</p>
<p>erence thereto. It seemed to him, that it would have been
</p>
<p>less discreditable to have revealed the whole proposition
</p>
<p>than to have resorted to the vague, equivocal and timid
</p>
<p>course imputed to him in the letter of Colonel Marshall.
</p>
<p>He therefore asserted that he had made a full disclosure to
</p>
<p>the convention ; and the argument was made for him that,
</p>
<p>if his conduct was reprehensible, the people knew it, and
</p>
<p>by twice thereafter electing him to Congress, had partici-
</p>
<p>pated in his guilt ; and, as the people were known to have
</p>
<p>been loyal, his election by them, established his own loy-
</p>
<p>alty ! No claim was then made that he had communicated
</p>
<p>the overture to Madison, and by his advice kept it secret
</p>
<p>from all but Muter and McDowell. From the beginning
</p>
<p>to the end of that pamphlet there is not an intimation
</p>
<p>that he had made a confidant of Madison, nor that he
</p>
<p>maintained secrecy. All that was an afterthought. On the
</p>
<p>contrary the misrepresentation then resorted to was that
</p>
<p>he had made the details of the matter public, that it was
</p>
<p>generally known, and that the people who elected him
</p>
<p>knowing the facts had shared his guilt, and, therefore, he
</p>
<p>was innocent !
</p>
<p>As will be seen, the convention had already directed an
</p>
<p>address to the Assembly of Virginia, requesting the pas-
</p>
<p>sage of a law for a legal separation agreeable to the rec-
</p>
<p>ommendation of Congress, and had defeated the resolution
</p>
<p>of John Brown designed for precipitate and illegal action.

<p>But, as a last, despairing effort, on Saturday, the 8th of
</p>
<p>the month. General Wilkinson, in order to suspend this
</p>
<p>address and prevent its adoption, offered a preamble recit-
</p>
<p>ing the discordant opinions which divided the people, and
</p>
<p>a resolution that a " committee be appointed to draft an
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 235
</p>
<p>address to the good people of the district," " solemnly
</p>
<p>calling on them to furnish the convention, at their next
</p>
<p>session, with instructions in what manner to proceed, on
</p>
<p>the important subject to them submitted," which was that
</p>
<p>of " independent government." The motion carried, and
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, Innes, Jouitt, Muter, Sebastian, xMlen and
</p>
<p>Caldwell were appointed as the committee.
</p>
<p>Crockett became so alarmed at the speeches of T3rown
</p>
<p>and Wilkinson, at the memorial of the latter to the In-
</p>
<p>tendant of Louisiana, and at this resolution calling upon
</p>
<p>the people for instructions, that he left his seat in the con-
</p>
<p>vention, hurried to Lexington, obtained the signatures of
</p>
<p>several hundred leading citizens of Fayette, remonstrating
</p>
<p>against any separation without the previous consent of
</p>
<p>Virginia, and with this returned to Danville by Monday,
</p>
<p>when he presented it to the convention, in which it was
</p>
<p>read. Wilkinson, who had pledged himself to obey in-
</p>
<p>structions, yielded to the inevitable with the best grace he
</p>
<p>could summon to his aid. On the same day, accordingly,
</p>
<p>he reported and read an address to Congress* praying
</p>
<p>* Wilkinson sent Miro a copy of the Lexington Gaielte containing the
</p>
<p>official report of the proceedings of 'the convention. In his letter to the
</p>
<p>Intendant dated February 14, 1789, he gave the following correct ac-
</p>
<p>count of the motives for this address to Congress on the subject of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi, over which Congress had no control, viz:
</p>
<p>" You will observe that the memorial to Congress w'as presented by
</p>
<p>me, and perhaps your first impression will be that of surprise at such a
</p>
<p>document having issued from the pen of a good Spaniaixl. But, on fur-
</p>
<p>ther reflection, you will discover that my policy is to justify in the eye
</p>
<p>of the world our meditated separation from the rest of the Union, and
</p>
<p>quiet the apprehensions of some friends in the Atlantic States, the bet-
</p>
<p>ter to divide them, because, knowing how impossible it is for the United
</p>
<p>States to obtain what we aspire to, not only did I gratify my sentiments
</p>
<p>and inclinations, but I also framed my memorial in such a style as was best

<p>calculated to excite the passions of our people ; and convince them that Con-
</p>
<p>gress has neither the power nor the will to enforce their claims and
</p>
<p>pretensions. Then, havihg energetically and publicly represented our
</p>
<p>rights and lucidly established our pretensions, if Congress does not sup-
</p>
<p>port them with efficiency {wldch you know it can not do, even if it had the
</p>
<p>inclination), not only will all the people of Kentucky, but also the

<p>that body to obtain the navigation of the Mississippi for
</p>
<p>the district ; which was adopted. He then read an ad-
</p>
<p>dress to the people,* which was referred to the committee
</p>
<p>of the whole and was never heard of again. It was sup-
</p>
<p>pressed.
</p>
<p>The committee of the whole reported to the convention
</p>
<p>the address of the Virginia assembly, which had been
</p>
<p>moved by Edwards and seconded by Marshall on the third
</p>
<p>day of the convention, had been reported by Edwards on
</p>
<p>the fourth day, an amendment to which was then offered
</p>
<p>in order to postpone its consideration, and which was on
</p>
<p>Monday, the seventh day, finally taken up, amended and
</p>
<p>adopted. The victory was won. The friends of Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son then ofl'ered a resolution thanking him for Ms memo-
</p>
<p>rial to the Intendant of Louisiana, which, as it was an
</p>
<p>empty compliment and could affect nothing practically in-
</p>
<p>jurious, was permitted to pass, by men who were too well
</p>
<p>content with their escape from real dangers to be severely
</p>
<p>critical as to non-essentials. And then the convention
</p>
<p>* The object of the resolution asking instructions from the people
</p>
<p>which was passed on Saturday, and added to Crockett's alarm, is thus
</p>
<p>explained in the Littell pamphlet, viz :
</p>
<p>" Here it was (in the November convention) that General Wilkinson
</p>
<p>read his treasonable memorial  and here it was that Mr. Brown reported
</p>
<p>his treasonable conference  and here it was (as they say in their first
</p>
<p>number,) that General Wilkinson made a treasonable motion that they
</p>
<p>should proceed to form a separate constitution, independent of the ac-
</p>
<p>tion of Virginia. The reader will see from the journal that Wilkinson
</p>
<p>made no such motion, and that the motion he did make, so far from
</p>
<p>tending to so rapid a progress, was of a retrograde tendency. The ob-
</p>
<p>ject was not to proceed to do any thing, except to impart to the people at
</p>
<p>large the information which had been received by that body, and to await
</p>
<p>their future instructions."

<p>tion, to impart which to the people at large was the object of Wilkinson's
</p>
<p>resolutions, and upon which the future instructions of the people were de-

<p>as to the terms upon which Spain was ready to grant the navigation of

<p>the Mississippi ! To make an incendiary appeal to the people, based
</p>
<p>upon this information, with the hope that they would instruct to make
</p>
<p>the plunge. The address which was drawn up by Wilkinson and read,

<p>point was the adoption of the resolution moved by Ed-

</p>
<p>In December, 1788, a call was made upon John Brown,
</p>
<p>in the columns of the Lexington GazHte, to communicate
</p>
<p>to the people the information which he had Avritten in his
</p>
<p>various letters, which w^ere far from having been kept as
</p>
<p>secret as his grandson would have one believe. The call
</p>
<p>evidently came from Wilkinson, or from some member of
</p>
<p>his coterie, and was designed to have the same effect as
</p>
<p>was intended by Wilkinson's address to the people, which
</p>
<p>had been suppressed. But the lesson taught the prudent
</p>
<p>Brown in the convention had rendered him even more
</p>
<p>circumspect than he was in that body.
</p>
<p>Some of the members w^io were sent to the Virginia
</p>
<p>House of Delegates from Kentucky (to the session of
</p>
<p>1788-9) were anxious that Washington should be informed
</p>
<p>of the movements in the district. Their wishes and ap-
</p>
<p>prehensions were communicated by them to Dr. David
</p>
<p>Stuart, one of the delegates from Fairfax county. * From
</p>
<p>Dr. Stuart, General Washins"ton received his first infor-
</p>
<p>* Dr. Stuart had married the widow of John Parke Custis  daughter
</p>
<p>of Benedict Calvert and a lineal descendant of the Lords Baltimore.

</p>
<p>mation * concerning the Spanish movements in Kentucky ;
</p>
<p>and at his request Dr. Stuart published in the Alexandria
</p>
<p>Gazette^ of January 22, 1789, an article from which the
</p>
<p>following is an extract, viz :
</p>
<p>" By information received from Kentucky, we learn, that many of the
</p>
<p>principal people of that district are warmly in favor of a separation
</p>
<p>from the Union, and contend that it is injurious to the interest of that
</p>
<p>country, to be connected with the Atlantic States. This idea, pregnant
</p>
<p>with so much mischief to America, is said to be much cherished by in-
</p>
<p>telligence carried there by Mr. Brown, member of Congress, to this effect:
</p>
<p>That lie had the strongest assurance from the Spanish Ambassador, that on such
</p>
<p>a declaration, Spain would cede to them tlte navigation of tJie Mississippi and
</p>
<p>give them every support."
</p>
<p>The article proceeded to urge that measures should be
</p>
<p>taken to check this movement.f
</p>
<p>the general. Those relations, and his own high character, made Dr.
</p>
<p>Stuart an intimate and highly valued friend of Washington, as appears
</p>
<p>in their correspondence. Washington testified this regard in his will.
</p>
<p>" In Washington's reply to the letter of Colonel Thomas Marshall, of
</p>
<p>February 2, 1789, the letter of Washington bearing date of March 27,
</p>
<p>1789  he stated : " If I was greatly alarmed at the nature of the trans-
</p>

<p>collect well Colonel Edwards, who has since, I think, been in Congress,

<p>municate their apprehensions to the general, in hopes, that on his elec-
</p>

<p>attempts. This was a little previous to the first election. He expressed

<p>much regret, and immediately, I have no doubt, addressed himself to

<p>Colonel Marshall, for more particular information. [There is no evi-

<p>fresh in his memory,  on the^ 12th February, 1789,
</p>
<p>Colonel Thomas Marshall wrote to General Washington

<p>ail account of John Brown's letter to Muter; of what

</p>
<p>Wilkinson had read in the convention ; and of the visit
</p>
<p>of J)r. John Connolly to himself and Muter and of all the
</p>
<p>details of their conversation. It is true, as stated by
</p>
<p>Colonel John Mason Brown (who, for a purpose which
</p>
<p>will hereafter appear, carefully suppressed what Colonel
</p>
<p>Marshall had written), that the accuracy of Colonel Mar-
</p>
<p>shall's recollection was not subjected to the test of a cross-
</p>
<p>examination ; but it was much more apt to have been cor-
</p>
<p>rect concerning events which had so recently transpired,
</p>
<p>tlian were the recollections given twenty-four years after
</p>
<p>by the witnesses who were subjected to that test in the
</p>
<p>suit of Innes v. Marshall. And it is a notable circum-
</p>
<p>stance, that not one of the witnesses whose testimony
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown cites in the slightest particular contra-
</p>
<p>dicted the statements made in the letter of Colonel Mar-

<p>given in that letter of the contents of John Brown's letter
</p>
<p>to Muter, the Littell pamphlet simply says that Colonel

<p>Marshall's account was as "unfavorable as possible," and
</p>
<p>then impliedly contradicts it by representing the Muter

<p>letter to have been the same as the letter to McDowell,

<p>which was not true. The reader will compare the pass-

<p>age in John Brown's letter to Muter relating to the pro-
</p>
<p>position of Gardoqui, with the description of its contents by
</p>
<p>Colonel Marshall ; and will see that the latter's description
</p>
<p>is not an exaggeration of those contents, and that a different
</p>
<p>representation could not have been made without a sacri-
</p>
<p>fice of the truth. The Littell pamphlet makes no allusion
</p>
<p>whatever to Colonel Marshall's statement of what John

<p>Brown said in the convention, in response to the call

<p>a copy thereof?

<p>Answer : I do not ; but upon reading the letters published in the
</p>
<p>newspapers, as having passed between Colonel Marshall and General
</p>
<p>AVashington, it appears to me to be tolerably accurately stated in
</p>
<p>Colonel Marshall's letter."
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown, in quoting this matter from Todd's deposition, sup-
</p>
<p>presses all but the last question and answer, so as to conceal from his
</p>
<p>readers, so far as possible, that the memorial was read in the convention of
</p>
<p>November, 1788.

</p>
<p>garcl to the overture of Gardoqui was an evidence of con-
</p>
<p>scious guilt, John Brown asserted through Littell that he
</p>
<p>had disclosed that overture in the convention. The ques-
</p>
<p>tion, then, is, whether John Brown in that convention sim-
</p>
<p>ply informed his auditors that, while he did not feel at
</p>
<p>liberty to mention what had occurred in the private con-
</p>
<p>ferences between Don Gardoqui and himself, yet he could
</p>
<p>assure them that, provided they acted with unanimity,
</p>
<p>every thing they desired was within their reach, as stated
</p>
<p>by Colonel Marshall? or, whether he told them plainly
</p>
<p>what Don Gardoqui had proposed, as asserted by John
</p>
<p>Brown himself in Littell?
</p>
<p>One of those statements must be true and the other
</p>
<p>false. If Colonel Marshall's statement was not true, then
</p>
<p>he was a deliberate falsifier; for, if John Brown had made
</p>
<p>a disclosure of the conference between Gardoqui and him-
</p>
<p>self to the convention, Colonel Marshall could not possibly
</p>
<p>have understood him as he reported him. And it would
</p>
<p>have been a falsification without a motive for the decep-
</p>
<p>tion ;  because John Brown's own statement makes a worse
</p>
<p>case against him than does that of Colonel Marshall. But,
</p>
<p>if the statement of John Brown that he had made the dis-
</p>
<p>closure publicly to the Danville convention had been true,
</p>
<p>what then must be thought of the conduct of James
</p>
<p>Brown, who, in that case, was unquestionably aware of
</p>
<p>the fact and of the nature of the overture made by Gar-
</p>
<p>doqui, in positively denying that any such proposition had
</p>
<p>ever been made to his brother, and in villifying James M.
</p>
<p>Marshall for mentioning and describing the contents of
</p>
<p>the letter of John Brown to Muter? In that case, James
</p>
<p>Brown stands convicted of vehemently denying that his
</p>
<p>brother had written in a letter what he knew he had
</p>
<p>uttered in a public speech in the presence of witnesses !

</p>
<p>the letter to Washington was true, then that of John
</p>
<p>Brown in the Littell pamphlet was deliberately false.
</p>
<p>The reader has seen what other suppressions and falsifica-
</p>
<p>tions John Brown was guilty of in that pamphlet. He
</p>
<p>has also seen that the other statements of Colonel Mar-
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 243
</p>
<p>shall's letter were fully corroborated. As to this, Benja-
</p>
<p>min Sebastian, in his deposition in the suit of Innes v.
</p>
<p>Marshall, was asked : " Do you recollect that, in the Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky convention of 1788, John Brown, then a member of
</p>
<p>Congress, was called on to give information of what had
</p>
<p>been communicated from Gardoqui, the Spanish minister,
</p>
<p>to him on the subject of the Mississippi, and if you recol-
</p>
<p>lect the information then given by John Brown, detail it?"
</p>
<p>To which Sebastian answered : " This deponent recollects
</p>
<p>that John Brown was called on to give information to the
</p>
<p>convention respecting some communication made to him
</p>
<p>by Gardoqui ; but as far as my memory serves me, the in-
</p>
<p>formation was made in such ambiguous terms that nothing
</p>
<p>could certainly be collected from it. Great advantages, it
</p>
<p>was said, would result to Kentucky by the adoption of
</p>
<p>some plan ; but whether it was a commercial one or of
</p>
<p>some other nature, this deponent does not now recollect."
</p>
<p>A very convenient memory, to be sure, but, as far as it
</p>
<p>goes, this confirms Colonel Marshall as to the ambiguity
</p>
<p>of Brown's answer, and contradicts Brown as to its direct-
</p>
<p>ness. Colonel Joseph Crockett, in his deposition in the
</p>
<p>same case, said that " John Brown made a short speech in
</p>
<p>said convention, which was about this : ' That he had it
</p>
<p>from the highest authority, that if we would separate from
</p>
<p>Virginia, every thing we could wish for was within our
</p>
<p>power to reach!'" On being asked what authority John
</p>
<p>Brown alluded to, or what authority he understood him to
</p>
<p>allude to, Crockett responded : " I do not recollect that he
</p>
<p>named any particular authority, but my impression was, and
</p>
<p>is, that it was Spanish authority that he alluded to in said com-
</p>
<p>munication." To the interrogatory of Innes, whether or not
</p>
<p>John Brown was " requested to give the convention infor-
</p>
<p>mation which he possessed relative to the navigation of
</p>
<p>the Mississippi before he made the speech hereinbefore

<p>stated by you," * Colonel Crockett answered aflirmatively.
</p>
<p>* It will be observed that the request was made at the suggestion of
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, and was a part of the plan which had been prearranged.
</p>
<p>Wilkinson did not need the information, but desired Brown to confirm
</p>
<p>the hint he had himself given out, which Brown did, though ambigu-
</p>
<p>ously.
</p>
<p>244 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>To the further question : " Did he say any thing more than
</p>
<p>merely to state the fact as detailed by you in your an-
</p>
<p>swer to the third interrogatory of the defendant?" The
</p>
<p>witness responded : " I answer, that, what I stated in my
</p>
<p>answer to the third interrogatory of the defendant was
</p>
<p>the substance of and all that was said by John Brown in the
</p>
<p>convention  perhaps he might have used more words."
</p>
<p>The very interrogatories of the plaintiff', Innes, imply an
</p>
<p>admission of the substantial accuracy of the recollection
</p>
<p>of the witness. The questions and the answers equally
</p>
<p>and fully confirm the statement of Colonel Marshall, and
</p>
<p>contradict that of John Brown as made by Littell. This
</p>
<p>deposition, given on the 29th of January, 1813, twenty-
</p>
<p>four years after the occurrence described, clearly shows
</p>
<p>that, notwithstanding the ambiguity of Brown's state-
</p>
<p>ment, he was understood by the witness, as he was equally
</p>
<p>well understood by others who heard him, to intimate to
</p>
<p>the convention that he knew from Gardoqui's own lips,
</p>
<p>that the Spaniard was ready to grant to Kentucky the
</p>
<p>navigation of the Mississippi, on condition that the dis-
</p>
<p>trict would declare its independence and assume sover-
</p>
<p>eignty ; and that this meant a separation from the Union
</p>
<p>as well as from Virginia is shown by the letters of Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson to Miro, and by that of John Brown to Muter.*
</p>
<p>* In the change of front made by many good and true men during the
</p>
<p>administration of John Adams, Colonel Crockett was one of those who
</p>
<p>left the Federal and united with the Republican party under Jefferson.
</p>
<p>He was appointed United States Marshal in place of Samuel ]McDowell,
</p>
<p>Jr., who attributed his removal to the misrepresentations and influence
</p>
<p>of "the Browns," who had become intensely hostile to all the Mc-
</p>
<p>Dowell family, as they were also to Muter. Colonel Crockett was
</p>
<p>friendly with Innes, who was judge of the court of which Crockett was
</p>
<p>marshal, and also with John Brown. He shielded them all he could,
</p>
<p>and in his testimony went to the utmost limit in their behalf to which

</p>
<p>he could go withovit sacrificing truth. He stated that John Brown did
</p>
<p>not within his hearing, either in the convention or in conversation out-
</p>
<p>side of it, advocate or urge a dismemberment of the Union, which was
</p>
<p>true, as, according to his own statement, all that Brown said was the
</p>
<p>ambiguous answer Crockett had already attributed to him. The mem-
</p>
<p>ory of Crockett was somewhat at fault in several particulars. He evi-
</p>
<p>dently did not, when he testified, perceive the drift of Brown's resolu-
</p>
<p>tion, which he attributed to Colonel Marshall. He also attributed the
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 245
</p>
<p>But there is not wanting other evidence to sustain this
</p>
<p>sworn testimony. In the letter of Judge Muter, by which
</p>
<p>he accompanied the publication of the letter of John
</p>
<p>Brown to him, dated August 20, 1806, and published in
</p>
<p>the Western World, he stated : "As to the information or
</p>
<p>assurance given by Mr. Brown, [in the jSTovember conven-
</p>
<p>tion  T. M. G.], I can not at this distance of time recollect
</p>
<p>particularly ; my impressions are, that he assured the con-
</p>
<p>vention that all they asked with respect to the navigation of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi was in their power to obtain." * The reader can
</p>
<p>address to the Assembly of Virginia to Wilkinson and Brown. The for-
</p>
<p>mer was on the committee, the latter was not. They were both opposed
</p>
<p>to it in toto, but, after Crockett had obtained the remonstrance from
</p>
<p>Fayette, they amended it by lugging in the question of the navigation
</p>
<p>of the Mississippi, and, in that form, assented to it in the committee of
</p>
<p>the whole, after having done all in their power to defeat it. What
</p>
<p>Colonel Crockett thought of their proceedings at the time is seen from
</p>
<p>the energy and expedition with which he obtained signatures to the re-
</p>
<p>monstrance against those proceedings. The nature and tone of the
</p>
<p>discussions in the November convention is also plainly discerned in the
</p>
<p>statement of Colonel Crockett in his letter to A. K. Marshall, in 1806:
</p>
<p>" I was in the convention of 1788 with Colonel Marshall, and knew he
</p>
<p>was opposed to a violent separation from the United States, and took on that
</p>
<p>subject most decided grounds." Why should Colonel Marshall have taken
</p>
<p>most decided grounds in the convention in opposition to a separation
</p>
<p>from the United States, if nothing was said or done in that convention
</p>
<p>to warrant the conviction that there was in that convention a party
</p>
<p>which was endeavoring to accomplish that separation?
</p>
<p>The friendship which existed between this gallant man and Colonel
</p>
<p>Marshall was ended by the death of the latter in 1803, but it was con-
</p>
<p>tinued between Colonel Crockett and Colonel Marshall's descendants.

<p>* In the midst of all the reprehension which the character and con-

<p>duct of Muter subsequent to 1788 unavoidably excite, one who remem-
</p>
<p>bers his real patriotism in time of need can not help feeling for him
</p>
<p>much commiseration. He had been a Colonel of Infantry in the State
</p>
<p>Line (not the commander of a ship, as stated in Collins), but was not
</p>
<p>at all distinguished. For a time he was commissioner of the Virginia
</p>
<p>war office, but an investigation of its affairs and of his management by
</p>
<p>246 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>form his own estimate, as to bow far the testimony of Se-
</p>
<p>bastian and Crockett and the statement of Muter confirm
</p>
<p>a legislative committee induced a report from its chairman, John Page,
</p>
<p>that it was in miserable condition, that Muter was not quaUfied for the
</p>
<p>position, and recommending his immediate dismissal. This was about
</p>
<p>to be done, when Muter resigned, March 21, 1781. [Virginia State Pa-
</p>
<p>pers, Vol. I, page 587]. He came to Kentucky in 1783, and in 1785 was
</p>
<p>elected judge of the district court. Part of his career in Kentucky has
</p>
<p>been already stated in these pages. The letter he published in 1790
</p>
<p>accompanying that of John Brown was dictated by his desire to show,
</p>
<p>that he had consented to the publication of the extract from Brown's
</p>
<p>letter, not by a becoming sense of what was due to truth, which had
</p>
<p>been falsified, but by a desire to prevent a duel. He continued friendly
</p>
<p>with Colonel Marshall. But when the district became a state in 1792,
</p>
<p>Innes, who was already judge of the federal court, was appointed chief
</p>
<p>justice of the court of appeals; while Muter, who had been chief jus-
</p>
<p>tice of the district court, was reduced to be judge only of Oyer and Ter-
</p>
<p>miner, with a salary which remained unfixed. It was generally under-
</p>
<p>stood that this was the penalty for having published John Brown's letter.
</p>
<p>Innes preferred the federal office, and then Muter was appointed to fill
</p>
<p>the vacancy. The implied contract under which this appointment was
</p>
<p>given and accepted, may be presumed from the fact that, after that day.
</p>
<p>Muter never crossed Colonel Marshall's threshold. In later years, he
</p>
<p>united with Sebastian in a decision, in the case in which Kenton and Mc-
</p>
<p>Connell were the parties, which would have vitiated nine-tenths of all
</p>
<p>the land titles in the state. Both branches of the legislature passed
</p>
<p>resolutions declaring the decision to have been corrupt, and to remove
</p>
<p>the two judges; but the movement failed for a want of a two-thirds
</p>
<p>majority in both branches, and the judges clung to their places. Shrink-
</p>
<p>ing under the pof^ular indignation and fearing that in the next Assem-
</p>
<p>bly the requisite majority would be obtained. Muter then turned around
</p>
<p>and united with Wallace in a reversal of his own decision. There was
</p>
<p>great anxiety to be rid of him, but he clung to his office until he man-
</p>
<p>aged to negotiate a bargain with the legislature for a pension of $300 per

<p>annum conditioned upon his resignation. In the next Assembly an
</p>
<p>effort was made to repeal the law granting the pension, but it was
</p>
<p>vetoed by the governor. The succeeding legislature, however, abolished
</p>
<p>it. He then became a pensioner on the bounty of Judge Thomas Todd,
</p>
<p>who was his successor. It was in the midst of these troubles, feeling
</p>
<p>that his means of subsistence were dependent on the will of those men,
</p>
<p>that Muter equivocated by publishing a letter referring to Wilkinson's
</p>
<p>memorial as of a commercial nature, and protesting that " there was
</p>
<p>nothing in John Brown's letters, information or assurance which im-
</p>
<p>pressed me with a belief that Mr. Brown intended to unite this country
</p>
<p>with Spain, or that his communications related to any thing other than
</p>

<p>Colonel Marshall's account of what John Brown said in

<p>from. They certainly disprove the statement made by
</p>
<p>John Brown through Littell, as to the nature of his utter-
</p>
<p>ances.
</p>
<p>When the depositions in the suit of Innes v. Marshall
</p>
<p>were taken, twenty-four years had passed, the times were
</p>
<p>changed, no public danger threatened, men who had for-
</p>
<p>merly clashed had been reconciled, there was a general
</p>
<p>disposition to throw the mantle of oblivion over the past,
</p>
<p>men were reluctant to give testimony which reflected
</p>
<p>upon others high in official station, and it was most diffi-
</p>
<p>cult to elicit the facts. If any w^ay was opened for an
</p>
<p>evasion they generally availed themselves thereof. Sam-
</p>
<p>uel McDowell was asked : " Have you any knowledge of
</p>
<p>a proposition being made at any time by any member of
</p>
<p>the convention to separate absolutely and unconditionally
</p>
<p>from the United States, and to form a connection with
</p>
<p>any other government ?" As no proposition in these terms
</p>
<p>had been made, McDowell, of course, replied, that he had
</p>
<p>" no knowledge or recollection of such a proposition ever
</p>
<p>having been made by any one." In reply to another ques-
</p>
<p>tion, he said that he had never heard Brown nor Innes
</p>
<p>" express a wish to sever the Union, or to have any con-
</p>
<p>nection with Spain except to trade to [N'ew Orleans." They
</p>
<p>had, then, expressed a wish for such a connection with
</p>
<p>Spain as would enable them to trade to Kew Orleans, and
</p>
<p>both knew that the privilege of that trade could only be
</p>
<p>had by a separation from the Union, though, it would
</p>
<p>seem, John Brown had concealed that fact from McDowell,
</p>
<p>and led him to believe that it could be obtained by Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky as a member of the Union.
</p>
<p>Caleb Wallace was also asked : " In that meeting held
</p>

</p>
<p>immediate framing of a constitution, the organization of
</p>
<p>the district into an independent and sovereign state, and a
</p>
<p>separation from Virginia without the sanction of law, the

<p>effect of which would have been to have detached Ken-

<p>tucky from the United States, and the object of which is

<p>explained by Wilkinson's engagement with and letters to

<p>Miro, and by the overture of Gardoqui to John Brown,
</p>
<p>of both of which Wallace had then been informed ;  Wal-

</p>
<p>he had himself either offered or seconded, and had advo-
</p>
<p>cated a resolution to immediately frame a constitution
</p>
<p>and had urged an immediate separation from Virginia,
</p>
<p>and who paid for, published and circulated Littell's state-

<p>ment that such a " motion was never made ; "  the ingenu-
</p>
<p>ous and candid Wallace  this " Israelite, indeed, in whom
</p>
<p>there was no guile;"  Wallace replied that he did not
</p>
<p>recollect that such a proposition as that indicated in the
</p>
<p>interrogatory had been made by any one in the July con-
</p>
<p>vention ! Asked the same question of the November con-
</p>
<p>vention, of the proceedings of which he was a spectator,
</p>
<p>he made substantially the same answer thereto. No reso-
</p>
<p>lution or motion in those terms having been offered in
</p>
<p>either convention, the answer can not be said to have been
</p>
<p>untrue.
</p>
<p>Greenup was asked : " Did you in July, 1788, hear a

<p>motion made and advocated by either James Wilkinson,

</p>
<p>he answered that he had not heard such a proposition
</p>
<p>from any person ; for, in fact, no motion in those terms
</p>
<p>had been made. Asked substantially the same question
</p>
<p>concerning the November convention, Greenup made the
</p>
<p>same reply ; qualifying it, however, by a reference to the
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 249
</p>
<p>resolution of Wallace, or Wilkinson, wliicli he made the
</p>
<p>mistake of saying had been offered at the N^ovember con-
</p>
<p>vention.
</p>
<p>To substantially the same question Isaac Shelby re-
</p>
<p>sponded : " In no convention of which I was a member,
</p>
<p>did I ever hear a motion or proposition madeby any mem-
</p>
<p>ber, to separate Kentucky from the United States, and
</p>
<p>form a connection with Spain," and that " he never did hear,
</p>
<p>nor was he ever informed that any member of any con-
</p>
<p>vention had made or advocated a proposition to separate
</p>
<p>Kentucky from the Union, to establish it into a separate
</p>
<p>government, and form a connection with any foreign power ; "
</p>
<p>and that he had never heard John Brown " express a sen-
</p>
<p>tence to him that he understood as having any desire to
</p>
<p>attach this country to Spain."
</p>
<p>The identity of the questions and of the answers in
</p>
<p>these several examinations reveals the objects of the in-
</p>
<p>terrogatories, which was to mislead. The answers tell
</p>
<p>what was not done ; they are silent as to what did take place.
</p>
<p>It has not been charged that a motion or proposition em-
</p>
<p>bracing the terms indicated in the interrogatories had been
</p>
<p>made or advocated by any one in any convention. The
</p>
<p>charge was, that the movement to separate Kentucky from
</p>
<p>Virginia illegally, and to frame a constitution, and organize
</p>
<p>government, and declare independence without a law for
</p>
<p>the purpose, was designed by the leaders who advocated
</p>
<p>it as the first step in the programme which had in view
</p>
<p>the separation of Kentucky from the Union and an alli-
</p>
<p>ance with Spain, as had been distinctly agreed upon be-
</p>
<p>tween Wilkinson and Miro, and as was as distinctly out-
</p>
<p>lined in Brown's conference with Gardoqui and in his
</p>
<p>letter to Muter. The questions were framed so that the
</p>
<p>replies might not meet the issue that was presented. Not

<p>one of those witnesses, nor any other, was asked a question

</p>
<p>peached the accuracy of Colonel Marshall's statement
</p>
<p>concerning what Brown had said in the convention, or

<p>250 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>as made by Littell, and leaves that of Marshall undis-
</p>
<p>puted. *
</p>
<p>* The following is the full text of the letter of Colonel ^Marshall to
</p>
<p>which reference has been made :
</p>
<p>Fayette County, 12th February, 1789.
</p>
<p>Dear General :
</p>
<p>The nature of the subject upon which I do myself the honor to ad-
</p>
<p>dress you, will I hope be admitted as an excuse for the trouble you will
</p>
<p>have in reading this letter. The political situation of this western
</p>
<p>country appears to me to be some thing critical, and therefore I have
</p>
<p>undertaken, though reluctantly, to give you a state of facts preceding
</p>
<p>our present situation, so far as they have fallen within my knowledge.
</p>
<p>In the spring, 1787, General Wilkinson went to New Orleans with a
</p>
<p>cargo of tobacco, etc., and was requested by the governor of that place
</p>
<p>to give his sentiments freely, in writing, respecting the political interest
</p>
<p>of Spain and the Americans of the United States inhabiting the western
</p>
<p>waters. This he did in an essay, as he calls it, contained in about 15 or
</p>
<p>20 sheets of paper. I saw the governor's letter to him acknowledging
</p>
<p>the receipt of it, and informing him that he would lay it before the king
</p>
<p>of Spain ; a copy of this essay he produced and read in our late conven-
</p>
<p>tion held for the district ; and as well as my memory (which I acknowl-
</p>
<p>edge is not very accurate) serves me, the substance of it is as follows :
</p>
<p>He urges our natural right of following the current of the rivers flowing
</p>
<p>through our country into the sea. He states the extent of our country,
</p>
<p>the richness of our soil, abounding in choice productions proper for for-
</p>
<p>eign markets, to which we have no means of conveying them, should the
</p>
<p>Mississippi be shut up against us. He states the advantages Spain might
</p>
<p>derive from allowing us the free use of that river. He goes on to show
</p>
<p>the rapid population of this country, and the eagerness with which
</p>
<p>every individual looks forward to that navigation. He states the gen-
</p>
<p>eral abhorrence with which the people of the western waters received
</p>
<p>the intelligence that Congress was about to sacrifice their dearest interest
</p>
<p>by ceding to Spain the navigation of the Mississippi for twentj' or thirty
</p>
<p>years, and represents it as a fact that they are on the point of separating

</p>
<p>themselves totally from the Union on that account.
</p>
<p>He addresses himself to their fears by a pompous display of our
</p>
<p>force, and urges that should Spain be so blind to her true interest as to
</p>
<p>refuse us an amicable participation in the navigation of that river, and
</p>
<p>thereby force us into violent measures, " Great Britain stands with her
</p>
<p>arms expanded ready to receive us," and assist our efforts for the ac-
</p>
<p>complishment of that object, and quotes a conversation he had a few
</p>
<p>years ago with a member of the British Parliament to that effect. He
</p>
<p>states the facility with which their province of Louisiana might be in-
</p>
<p>vaded bv the united forces of the British and Americans, by means of
</p>
<p>the river Illinois, and the practicability of proceeding from thence to
</p>
<p>their province of New Mexico, it not being more than twenty days.
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 251
</p>
<p>The statement of Brown's answer in the convention to
</p>
<p>Britain, he says, will in that case aim at the possession of Louisiana and
</p>
<p>New Orleans for herself, and leave the freedom of the navigation to
</p>
<p>America ; and urges pretty forcibly the great danger the Spanish inter-
</p>
<p>est in North America would be in from the British power, should that
</p>
<p>nation possess herself of the mouth of the Mississippi, and thereby hold
</p>
<p>the two grand portals of North America, that river and the St. Law-
</p>
<p>rence ; and concludes with an apology for the freedom with which he
</p>
<p>has treated the subject, and adds, that it has at their own particular re-
</p>
<p>quest been drawn from a man "whose head may err, but whose heart
</p>
<p>can not deceive."
</p>
<p>This essay has, I am told, been laid before the Court of Madrid ;
</p>
<p>and as a violent separation from the United States seems to be laid
</p>
<p>down as the ground work upon which every other consequence de-
</p>
<p>pends, I think it probably has produced instructions from that Court to
</p>
<p>the Spanish resident at Congress, that if the Western country should
</p>
<p>declare itself separate from the Union, to avail himself of that event.
</p>
<p>I found this conjecture upon Mr. Brown's confidential letters from Con-
</p>
<p>gress to his friends in this district; some of those letters I have seen.
</p>
<p>He mentions that in a private conversation, which he had with Don
</p>
<p>Gardoqui, he was informed that so long as this country remained a part
</p>
<p>of the Union, we had nothing to expect from Spain, but were we ta
</p>
<p>declare ourselves separate from, and independent of, the United States,
</p>
<p>he was authorized to treat with us respecting commerce and the naviga-
</p>
<p>tion of the Mississippi.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brown, having returned from Congress, was called upon in Con-
</p>
<p>vention in November last, to give such information respecting our
</p>
<p>affairs in Congress as might be proper for us to know. He told us that
</p>
<p>he did not think himself at liberty to mention what passed in private
</p>
<p>conversation between himself and Don Gardoqui respecting us; but
</p>
<p>this much he would venture to inform us, that provided we were united
</p>
<p>in our councils, every thing we could wish for was within our reach ; 
</p>
<p>meaning, as it appeared fully to me, that if we would assume govern-
</p>
<p>ment and declare separate from the Union, Spain would give us every

<p>indulgence we could ask for.
</p>
<p>About this time arrived from Canada the famous Doctor (now Col-
</p>
<p>onel) Conolly; his ostensible business was to inquire after, and re-pos-
</p>
<p>sess himself of, some lands he formerly held at the Falls of Ohio ; but I
</p>
<p>believe his real business was to soiind the disposition of the leading
</p>
<p>men of this district respecting this Spanish business. He knew that
</p>
<p>both Colonel Muter and myself had given it all the opposition in con-
</p>
<p>vention we were able to do, and before he left the district, paid us a
</p>
<p>visit, though neither of us had the honor of the least acquaintance with
</p>
<p>him.
</p>
<p>He was introduced by Colonel John Campbell, formerly a prisoner
</p>
<p>taken by the Indians, and confined in Canada, who previously informed
</p>
<p>us of the proposition he was about to make. He (Conolly) presently

</p>
<p>the call made on him for information, made by Colonel
</p>
<p>Marshall to Washington is here repeated :
</p>
<p>" He told us that he did not think himself at liberty to mention what
</p>
<p>passed in private conversation between himself and Don Gardoqui
</p>
<p>respecting us; but this much he would venture to inform us, that, pro-
</p>
<p>vided we were united in our councils, every thing we could wish for
</p>
<p>was within our reach."
</p>
<p>In the first edition of his History of Kentucky, pub-
</p>
<p>lished in 1812, and in the second edition published in 1824,
</p>
<p>entered upon his subject, iirged the great importance the navigation of
</p>
<p>the Mississippi must be of to the inhabitants of the Western waters,
</p>
<p>shewed the absolute necessity of our possessing it, and concluded with
</p>
<p>assurances that were we disposed to assert our right respecting that
</p>
<p>navigation. Lord Dorchester was cordially disposed to give us powerful
</p>
<p>assistance, that his Lordship had (I think he said) four thousand British
</p>
<p>troops in Canada beside t\\ o regiments at Detroit, and could furnish us
</p>
<p>with arms, ammunition, clothing and money ; that, with this assistance,
</p>
<p>we might possess ourselves of New Orleans, fortify the Balize at the
</p>
<p>mouth of the river, and keep possession in spite of the utmost efforts of
</p>
<p>Spain to the contrary. He made very confident professions of Lord
</p>
<p>Dorchester's wishes to cultivate the most friendly intercourse with the
</p>
<p>people of this country, and of his own desire to become serviceable to
</p>
<p>us, and with so much seeming sincerity, that had I not before been ac-
</p>
<p>quainted with his chai'acter as a man of intrigue and artful address, I
</p>
<p>should in all probability have given him my confidence.
</p>
<p>I told him that the minds of the people of this country were so
</p>
<p>strongly prejudiced against the British, not only from circumstances
</p>
<p>attending the late war, but from a persuasion that the Indians were at
</p>
<p>this time stimulated by them against us, and that so long as those sav-
</p>
<p>ages continued to commit such horrid cruelties on our defenseless fron-
</p>
<p>tiers, and were received as friends and allies by the British at Detroit,
</p>
<p>it would be impossible for them to be convinced of the sincerity of Lord
</p>
<p>Dorchester's offers, let his professions be ever so strong ; and that, if his
</p>
<p>Lordship would have us believe him really disposed to be our friend, he

</p>
<p>must begin by shewing his disapprobation of the ravages of the Indians.
</p>
<p>He admitted of the justice of my observation, and said he had urged
</p>
<p>the same to his Lordship before he left Canada. He denied that the
</p>
<p>Indians are stimulated against us by the British, and says Lord Dor-
</p>
<p>chester observed that the Indians are free and independent nations, and
</p>
<p>have a right to make peace or war as they think fit, and that he could
</p>
<p>not with propriety interfere. He promised, however, on his return to
</p>
<p>Canada to repeat his arguments to his Lordship on the subject, and
</p>
<p>hopes, he says, to succeed. At taking his leave he begged very politely
</p>
<p>the favor of our correspondence ; we both promised him, provided he
</p>
<p>would begin it, and devise a means of carrying it on. He did not tell
</p>
<p>me that he was authorized by Lord Dorchester to make us these offers
</p>
<p>in his name, nor did I ask him ; but General Scott informs me that he

<p>Humphrey Marshall, in giving an account of John Brown's
</p>
<p>performance in the convention, published, with quotation
</p>
<p>marks, the following version, viz :
</p>
<p>" That he did not think himself at liberty to disclose what had passed
</p>
<p>in private conferences between the Spanish minister, Mr. Gardoqui, and
</p>
<p>himself ; but this much in general he would venture to inform the Con-
</p>
<p>tion  that provided v-e are v.nanimous every thing we could tuish for is
</p>
<p>within our reach."
</p>
<p>Humphrey Marshall did not think it.necessary to name
</p>
<p>his authority for this quotation, because the letter of Col-
</p>
<p>onel Thomas Marshall had recently been published and
</p>
<p>widely commented upon, and nearly every well informed
</p>
<p>reader at the time knew that he repeated the account
</p>
<p>given by Colonel Marshall, which had remained unchal-
</p>
<p>lenged. Butler, in quoting from Humphrey Marshall's
</p>
<p>History, knew that he had obtained it from Colonel Thomas
</p>
<p>Marshall, and he accepted it as the true account, while he
</p>
<p>rejected that given by John Brown himself in Littell as
</p>
<p>false. The versions of the two Marshalls are identical in
</p>
<p>sense, and are almost identical in words ; the one using
</p>
<p>the word " mention " where the other says " disclose ; "
</p>
<p>the one using the word " conversation," while the other
</p>
<p>employs that of " conference ; " the one saying " united in
</p>
<p>council," and the other "unanimous; "  in every case the
</p>
<p>words employed meaning precisely the same thing, with-
</p>
<p>out the diiFerence of a shade in their signification. It is
</p>
<p>evident that if injustice was done to John Brown, it was
</p>
<p>by Colonel Marshall, and not by the historian, who simply
</p>
<p>repeated what he had a right to believe, and what he had
</p>
<p>obtained from the published statement of one who had
</p>
<p>told him that his Lordship had authorized him to use his name in this
</p>
<p>business.
</p>
<p>It appears plain to me that the offers of Lord Dorchester, as well as
</p>
<p>those of Spain, are founded on a supposition that it is a fact that we are

<p>been present, a man of intelligence and vigorous mind,
</p>
<p>whose veracity had never been assailed.
</p>
<p>Colonel John Mason Brown casually alludes to the pri-
</p>
<p>vate letter of Colonel Marshall, of the 12th of February,
</p>
<p>1789, addressed to General Washington, apparently for
</p>
<p>the sole purpose of saying that it was published after his
</p>
<p>death, " when it was too late to test the accuracy of the
</p>
<p>words used or try his judgment of the facts by cross-ex-
</p>
<p>amination." In that connection he states that nothing
</p>
<p>warranting the "alleged quotation " used by Humphrey
</p>
<p>Marshall, was ever published by Colonel Marshall or upon
</p>
<p>his authority. Characteristically Colonel Brown omitted
</p>
<p>to state, that the private letter published after Colonel
</p>
<p>Marshall's death was identical in sense and nearly identical
</p>
<p>in words with what he terms an "alleged quotation," and
</p>
<p>was the historian's ample authority ; then, as characterist-
</p>
<p>ically, he suppressed what Colonel Marshall had written.
</p>
<p>His statement that not a few of the delegates to the con-
</p>
<p>vention of November, 1788, were called to the witness
</p>
<p>stand and "under the sanction of their oaths, repelled the
</p>
<p>charge which the ' quotation ' insinuated," is so far from
</p>
<p>being true, that Sebastian and Crockett, the only witnesses
</p>
<p>who were asked a question or testified one word concern-
</p>
<p>ing what Brown had said in answer to the call on him for
</p>
<p>information, confirmed that charge, which was not " insin-
</p>
<p>uated," but was broadly and boldly stated in connection
</p>
<p>with that " quotation."

<p>Colonel Brown gives a list of men who were not called,

<p>that suit, and as the truth of Marshall's charges against

<p>Brown not only fails to give a single question asked by Innes
</p>
<p>discrediting the " quotation " made to the disparagement of
</p>
<p>his friend, but does not give a single answer which even tends
</p>
<p>to dispute the accuracy of that " quotation." Alleging that,
</p>
<p>out of all the depositions taken in that suit, not one " sus-

</p>
<p>tains the alleged quotation, or warrants any inference like
</p>
<p>it," and mentioning that of Sebastian, he suppresses what
</p>
<p>Sebastian said. And he not only carefully suppresses the
</p>
<p>statement of Crockett, which fully sustains that written
</p>
<p>by Colonel Marshall and "quoted" by the historian, but
</p>
<p>suppresses also the question propounded by Innes, which
</p>
<p>impliedly admitted the accuracy of Crockett's recollec-
</p>
<p>tion. He suppresses the fact that the " alleged quota-
</p>
<p>tion " was but a reproduction of what Colonel Marshall
</p>
<p>had communicated to Washington. " The Political Be-
</p>
<p>ginnings" details at length what Shelby, A\^allace and
</p>
<p>others did not recollect to have heard. But, while naming
</p>
<p>John Allen, of Bourbon, as one of the witnesses in that
</p>
<p>case, and boldly asserting that not one of those witnesses
</p>
<p>had uttered a word to warrant the charge made by Hum-
</p>
<p>phrey Marshall against John Brown, the talented author
</p>
<p>of the book in question was extremely careful to 07nit
</p>
<p>what John Allen had said. It might have disarranged
</p>
<p>his argument somewhat, if he had informed his readers,
</p>
<p>that Judge Allen had deposed, that, in the ISTovember con-
</p>
<p>vention of 1788, there was " a strong party in favor of
</p>
<p>declaring Kentucky independent, and of organizing a gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, without applying to the Legislature of Virginia
</p>
<p>or to Congress for their previous consent. Mr. John Brown
</p>
<p>was a member of that convention and advocated that
</p>
<p>measure. Colonel Hary Innes was also an advocate of
</p>
<p>that measure." The author of the " Beginnings " felt that,
</p>
<p>after having thus mentioned Allen as one of the witnesses,
</p>
<p>and having assured the confiding public, that 7io witness
</p>
<p>had uttered a word to sustain Humphrey Marshall's
</p>
<p>charges, he could scarcely afford to let them know, that
</p>
<p>Allen had sworn, that, in the November convention, " there
</p>
<p>were two distinct parties; the object of one was to en-
</p>

<p>mitting Kentucky to be separated from her, to become a
</p>
<p>new State, to form her own constitution, and to be ad-
</p>
<p>mitted into the General Government, and be upon an
</p>
<p>equal footing with the other States of the Union. The
</p>
<p>other party was for separating from Virginia, and to form
</p>
<p>256 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>a government independent of her and of the General Govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and to form connections where they should find it most
</p>
<p>beneficial to her interest^ Innes, Judge Allen testified, was
</p>
<p>an active member, and he considered him as advocating
</p>
<p>the course of the latter party as he had stated. The other
</p>
<p>leaders of the party, which was in favor of separating from
</p>
<p>Virginia without a law for the purpose, he said, were
</p>
<p>" General James Wilkinson, who was considered as among
</p>
<p>the first, Mr. John Brown, Mr. Caleb Wallace, Benjamin
</p>
<p>Sebastian and some others not recollected." He did not
</p>
<p>remember whether Adams, of Madison, was in the July
</p>
<p>or in the November convention, but he did know that he
</p>
<p>was an advocate of the measure. Nor did he remember
</p>
<p>whether Caleb Wallace was in the July or November con-
</p>
<p>vention, or in both. The evidence of Allen was that of
</p>
<p>a man who was never asserted to have been animated by
</p>
<p>personal hostility to Brown, nor by jealousy of him or of
</p>
<p>any of his associates."^ Nevertheless, it was necessary to
</p>
<p>suppress his evidence.
</p>
<p>Colonel John Mason Brown had read the letter of Col-
</p>
<p>onel Thomas Marshall to Washington. He knew that the
</p>
<p>" alleged quotation " published in Humphrey Marshall's
</p>
<p>History was but a repetition of what Colonel Marshall had
</p>
<p>written. He knew also that this account of what John
</p>
<p>Brown had said in the convention was corroborated by
</p>
<p>both Sebastian and Crockett. He suppressed the fact that
</p>
<p>this account had been thus written by Colonel Marshall,
</p>
<p>*Johu Allen was born in James City County, Va., in 1749. Entering
</p>
<p>the patriot army at the beginning of the Revolution, he rose to the rank
</p>
<p>of Major. He was well educated and a well trained lawyer. Marrying
</p>
<p>Miss Jane Tandy, of a respectable family in Albemarle, he came to
</p>
<p>Kentucky some years prior to 1788, and located in Fayette. Upon the
</p>
<p>organization of Bourbon, he settled in Paris. He was the first judge of
</p>
<p>the district court of Bourbon, and afterwards of the circuit court. In

<p>point of personal worth and integrity of character. Judge Allen was not
</p>
<p>inferior to any man in Kentucky of his time, and to but feAV in point of
</p>
<p>intelligence and ability. His descendants, many of whom live in Bour-
</p>
<p>bon, Nicholas and Bath, have just cause for pride in such an ancestor.
</p>
<p>Among them were the late Sandford Allen, of Sharpsburg, and the late

<p>is his grandson.

<p>an eye and ear witness ; that it had been thus corroborated
</p>
<p>by Sebastian and Crockett, and had never been challenged
</p>
<p>by a single question, nor disputed by a solitary witness.
</p>
<p>He then asserted that " Muter never said, wrote, or printed,
</p>
<p>that Brown spoke at all in the convention, much less that
</p>
<p>he sjyoke treasonably. No memoranda of his have ever been
</p>
<p>discovered or mentioned corroborative of any insinuation
</p>
<p>against Brown's acts or opinions in the convention." The
</p>
<p>extraordinary pains taken by Colonel Brown to suppress
</p>
<p>the statements made by Colonel Marshall, by Sebastian,
</p>
<p>and by Crockett, relating to John Brown's speech in the
</p>
<p>convention, and his repeated claim that the " alleged quo-
</p>
<p>tation" originated with Humphrey Marshall, discloses his
</p>
<p>own sense of the nature of that speech, and his own judg-
</p>
<p>ment of the conduQt of John Brown, if he had made the
</p>
<p>speech attributed to him. But the terms in which the
</p>
<p>above denial as to Muter are made convey a distinct ad-
</p>
<p>mission, that the speech attributed to John Brown was
</p>
<p>^^treasonable," and that ?f the premise was true the con-
</p>
<p>clusion drawn from it was just. It appears also, that Col-
</p>
<p>onel Brown had searched for some word, or writing, or
</p>
<p>publicatioyi by Muter, which stated that John Brown had
</p>
<p>spoken in the convention, and had been unable to find any
</p>
<p>intimation that John Brown " had spoken at all in the con-
</p>
<p>vention, much less that he spoke treasonably." N'otwith-
</p>
<p>standing this bold and confident assertion by Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown, it is certain that Muter not only wrote, hwi printed,
</p>
<p>and published in the Western World (a paper with whose
</p>
<p>columns Colonel Brown was familiar) a letter, August 20,
</p>
<p>1806, in which he distinctly stated, that John Brown had
</p>
<p>spoken in that convention, and had " assured the convention
</p>
<p>that all they asked for with respect to the yiavigation of the
</p>
<p>Mississippi was in their power to obtain;''  which assurance
</p>
<p>was given by John Brown in reply to the call on him to

<p>inform the convention concerning the communication of
</p>
<p>Gardoqui ; and which statement by Muter is the substance
</p>
<p>of what Colonel Marshall wrote and Humphrey Marshall
</p>
<p>" quoted !" Colonel Brown, it will be remembered, had
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>258 The Sjmriish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>previously alleged, that Muter had voted for sundry reso-
</p>
<p>lutions in the July convention, of which Muter's own let-
</p>
<p>ter, published in Littell's " Narrative " (with which Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown was familiar), showed that he was not a member;
</p>
<p>and that Muter had then received, and had communicated
</p>
<p>to Colonel Marshall, John Brown's letter, which Muter's
</p>
<p>own letter, published in the Western World, showed that
</p>
<p>Muter did not receive until the fall of 1788 ; and that
</p>
<p>Muter, when he had issued his address of October 15th,
</p>
<p>1788, had already conferred with Connolly, whom, as all
</p>
<p>the evidence shows. Muter had never seen until after tlie
</p>
<p>adjournment of the November convention. And now
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown, with habitual infelicity, adds to the inac-
</p>
<p>curacies which had preceded it, this denial that Muter had
</p>
<p>ever said, written, or printed that John Brown "spoke
</p>
<p>at all at the convention, much less that he spoke treason-
</p>
<p>ably ! "
</p>
<p>While thus admitting, that, if John Brown had spoken
</p>
<p>in the Danville convention as represented, he had " spoken
</p>
<p>treasonably," and that, in that case, the charge against
</p>
<p>him was merited; Colonel Brown labors through limping
</p>
<p>pages of his "Political Beginnings" to make it appear
</p>
<p>that this representation was maliciously fabricated by Hum-
</p>
<p>phrey Marshall. Knowing thoroughly well the scheme

<p>eyes the proof that Gardoqui had made a similar proposi-

<p>tion to his grandfather, and that the latter had promised
</p>
<p>Gardoqui to " aid " in securing its acceptance ; confronted
</p>
<p>by his grandfather's letter to Muter, in which he distinctly
</p>
<p>urged that the necessary step should be taken to place

<p>Kentucky in a position to avail herself of Gardoqui's oifer,

</p>
<p>and by the evidence of such men as Allen, Crockett,
</p>
<p>Thomas Marshall, and others, as to his grandfather's co-
</p>
<p>operation with Wilkinson and Sebastian in the effort to
</p>
<p>induce Kentucky to take that step ;  in the face of all this,
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown is bold enouii:h to assert that the " so-called
</p>
<p>The Spa7iish Conspiracy. 259
</p>
<p>' S[)anish conspiracy,' gloomily imagined as concocted with
</p>
<p>Gardoqui, was but a figment of an incensed political ad-
</p>
<p>versary's brain ; a suspicion unsupported by a particle of
</p>
<p>testimony, unvouched by document, unestablished b}^ dep-
</p>
<p>osition, and refuted by every proof."
</p>
<p>After perusing that, the reader Avill not be in the least
</p>
<p>surprised, that Colonel Brown, with full knowledge that
</p>
<p>his grandfather had certainly informed both Greenup and
</p>
<p>Wilkinson of Gardoqui's proposition ; that his " sliding
</p>
<p>letter" to McDowell was shown at once to Innes, and was
</p>
<p>known to others in the July convention of 1788 ; knowing
</p>
<p>that, in the Littell pamphlet, his grandfather had stated,
</p>
<p>that he had made a public disclosure of Gardoqui's propo-
</p>
<p>sition in the convention of !^ovember, 1788 ;  the reader
</p>
<p>will not be surprised, that Colonel Brown, knowing all
</p>
<p>these facts, and scrupulously and characteristically sup-
</p>
<p>pressing them, has the hardihood to affirm, that " under the
</p>
<p>cautious advice of Madison, information of Gardoqui's
</p>
<p>communication was thus kept from the knowledge of all
</p>
<p>persons in Kentucky save McDowell and Muter;" nor
</p>
<p>will they be in the least astonished at the remarkable cool-
</p>
<p>ness with which the grandson, in direct contradiction of
</p>
<p>his own grandfather, and with the most contemptuous as-
</p>
<p>sumption of the utter ignorance of his readers, asserts,
</p>
<p>that ^'Brown recognized the public dayiger that might come from
</p>
<p>divulging Gardoqui's phm," and that ^^Brown judged it highly
</p>
<p>inexpedient to narrate even to the sovereignty convention of
</p>
<p>November what Gardoqui had said, for he feared lest rash men.
</p>
<p>might make trouble by advocating what Gardoqui proposed!'^
</p>
<p>These suppressions and conflicting statements between
</p>
<p>grandfather and grandson, in the language of the talented
</p>
<p>author of the " Beginnings," "give rise to unpleasant sug-

<p>Littell, that, in answer to the call on him for information,
</p>
<p>John Brown had disclosed to the I[ovember convention
</p>
<p>the proposition of Gardoqui. If he believed that state-
</p>
<p>ment to be false, it is unimportant what else he must nec-
</p>
<p>essarily have believed of the man who had thus authorized
</p>
<p>260 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>and circulated a deliberately false statement in his own
</p>
<p>behalf. Innocence neither needs nor resorts to falsehood
</p>
<p>for its vindication. But, if Colonel Brown, on the other
</p>
<p>hand, really discredited the statement of Colonel Marshall
</p>
<p>that John Brown had said that, provided the convention
</p>
<p>was united in their councils, all they could wish for was
</p>
<p>within their reach ; and, if he believed that, on the con-
</p>
<p>trary, John Brown had communicated the overture of
</p>
<p>Gardoqui to the convention, as John Brown himself
</p>
<p>claimed to have done; and, believing this, and suppress-
</p>
<p>ing the statement of his grandfather, and attributing that
</p>
<p>of Colonel Marshall to Humphrey Marshall, asserted that
</p>
<p>John Brown deemed it inexpedient to communicate to the
</p>
<p>convention what Gardoqui had said, " lest rash men might
</p>
<p>make mischief by advocating what Gardoqui proposed ;" 
</p>
<p>then, the facts have been very feebly stated if intelligent
</p>
<p>readers are not able to arrive at their own conclusions, as
</p>
<p>just as they are inevitable, concerning the " Political Be-
</p>
<p>ginnings," without suggestions from the writer. There
</p>
<p>can be no logical escape, however, from the alternatives
</p>
<p>presented. And whether Colonel Brown believed the

<p>statement written by Colonel Marshall to Washington, or

<p>that of John Brown, published in Littell, his own state-

</p>
<p>To the reader who derives liis information solely from
</p>
<p>the perusal of " The Political Beginnings," it would ap-
</p>
<p>pear, that the subject of the navigation of the Mississippi
</p>
<p>came before the convention of November, 1788, solely
</p>
<p>during the discussion of the petitions from Madison and
</p>
<p>Mercer, (that an address to Congress to obtain that naviga-
</p>
<p>tion should be drawn), upon the resolution that the address
</p>
<p>should be prepared, and upon that address itself. * Yet
</p>
<p>it distinctly appears from Littell, whose authorized state-

<p>ment had been carefully studied by Colonel Brown, that
</p>
<p>the question of that navigation was brought before the

<p>convention by General Wilkinson, and by John Brown,

</p>
<p>Wilkinson's conference with Miro, and to the overture
</p>
<p>made by Gardoqui to John Brown ;  which conferences
</p>
<p>and overture (that Spain would grant the navigation to
</p>
<p>Kentucky, as a matter of treaty, if Kentucky would lirst
</p>
<p>withdraw from the Union), were authoritatively stated by
</p>
<p>Littell as the motive for the opposition made b}^ Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son, Brown, Innes, Sebastian, and their party, to Edwards'
</p>
<p>address to the assembly for an act of separation agreeable
</p>
<p>to the advice of Congress, and for their urging the resolu-
</p>
<p>tion of John Brown, which looked to an immediate and
</p>
<p>illegal separation, to an immediate declaration of inde-
</p>
<p>pendence and assumption of sovereignty, in order to avail
</p>
<p>themselves of the "prospect" held out by that confer-
</p>
<p>ence and overture. The address to Congress to obtain the
</p>
<p>navigation of the Mississippi, as the reader has seen, was
</p>
<p>not adopted until the last day of the convention, after all
</p>
<p>the schemes of Wilkinson and Brown had failed, and
</p>
<p>Wilkinson had been driven to postpone them under pres-
</p>
<p>sure of the remonstrance presented by Crockett. Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown makes no mention of the memorial to the Intend-
</p>
<p>ant of Louisiana, which Wilkinson had concerted with
</p>
<p>ISTavarro and Miro, which he had read in the convention,
</p>
<p>which had been forwarded to Madrid, and the effect of
</p>
<p>which was the direction to Gardoqui that induced his
</p>
<p>overture to John Brown. He quotes from depositions of
</p>
<p>members of the Danville convention, but suppresses every
</p>
<p>statement in those very depositions that the memorial was
</p>
<p>read in the convention. He does, however, mention the
</p>
<p>address to Congress which was finally adopted, and was
</p>
<p>prepared and read by Wilkinson, and states that, " after a
</p>
<p>vote of thanks to Wilkinson, for his paper on the Missis-
</p>

<p>dress to Congress on that subject ;  when the depositions,
</p>
<p>the official report, the statement of Littell, all of which he
</p>
<p>had read, and every other statement ever published, ex-
</p>
<p>plicitly informed him, that the paper in question, for
</p>
<p>which Wilkinson was thanked, was the " address presented
</p>
<p>The Spanish Coyispiracy . 263
</p>
<p>by General James Wilkinson to the Governor Intendant
</p>
<p>of Louisiana." The failure of Colonel Brown to mention
</p>
<p>this memorial, or to state that it was read in the conven-
</p>
<p>tion, his suppression of the fact that the question of the
</p>
<p>navigation of the Mississippi was brought before the con-
</p>
<p>vention by that memorial "^ and by John Brown's state-
</p>
<p>* While Wilkinson, after. doing what was in iiis power to defeat tlie
</p>
<p>address to the General Assembly, yielded to the desire that an appeal
</p>
<p>should be made to Congress to obtain the navigation of the Mississippi,
</p>
<p>which he knew Congress could not do, he explained to IMiro that the
</p>
<p>failure of Congress to accomplish the impossible could be used to still
</p>
<p>further exasperate the people and to aid the designs of Spain. At the
</p>
<p>same time he advised Miro that Spain should stand firm, refuse to ac-
</p>
<p>cede to the applications of Congress in behalf of the just rights of the
</p>
<p>western people, and close more completely than ever that navigation
</p>
<p>against all but himself and his associates. Every relaxation of rigor, he
</p>
<p>argued, would tend to postpone and defeat the Spanish designs ; while

<p>the greater the hardships which the people could be forced to feel would
</p>
<p>the more rapidly and certainly promote those designs. But let Wilkin-

<p>son speak for himself, viz :
</p>
<p>" In order to aid the favorable dispositions of Providence, to foment
</p>
<p>the suspicions and feelings of distrust already existing here, and inflame the ani-
</p>
<p>mosity between the eastern and the loestern states, Spain must resort to every
</p>
<p>artifice and other means which may be in her power. I have stated
</p>
<p>that the navigation of the Mississippi, and its admission as an independ-

<p>ent state and a member of the Union, are rightly claimed by the people

<p>of this part of the country, and constituting one of the principal condi-
</p>
<p>tions under which its connection with the Atlantic States is to continue.
</p>
<p>Hence it follows, that every manifestation of the power of Spain and of the
</p>
<p>debility of the United States, every evidence of the resolution of the former to
</p>
<p>retain exclusively for herself the right of navigation on the Mississippi, and
</p>
<p>every proof of the incapacity of the latter, will facilitate our views.

<p>" Until I devoted myself exclusively to the atlair fn which we are en-
</p>
<p>gaged, I confess that I could not discover the aim of the first treaty pro-
</p>
<p>posed by Gardoqui to Congress, but it seems to me now that I can pene-
</p>
<p>trate its policy. I consider it as profoundly judicious, and I am of
</p>
<p>opinion that it ought to be renewed and vigorously carried on, until its
</p>
<p>objects be attained, cost what it may, because, besides that the proposed
</p>
<p>relinquishment of the right of navigation of the Mississippi would im-
</p>
<p>mediately disrupt the Union, and separate forever the West from the
</p>
<p>East, the sanction of the treaty by Congress would make our situation so
</p>
<p>truly desperate that Great Britain would not venture to intervene in our
</p>
<p>favor and all our liopes would rest on the liberality of Spain.

</p>
<p>merit, that all that could be wished for concerning that
</p>
<p>navigation could he obtained, on the terms communicated
</p>
<p>to him by Gardoqui, was not accidental. And the course
</p>
<p>of Colonel Brown in reference thereto reveals his own
</p>
<p>sense of the damaging character of the facts he suppressed
</p>
<p>to the cause he had undertaken.
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown, in his " Political Beginnings," states^
</p>
<p>that the official proceedings of the convention * note the
</p>
<p>resolution of John Brown as having been offered on the
</p>
<p>fourth day of the convention, immediately after the com-
</p>
<p>mittee of the whole reported that the petitions from Mer-
</p>
<p>cer and Madison were reasonable, and that a decent and
</p>
<p>manly address to Congress should be drawn accordingly-
</p>
<p>and that this resolution was offered " before the committees
</p>
<p>were ready with their reports." But the very official
</p>
<p>manuscript to which he refers, and which is reproduced in.
</p>
<p>the appendix of his most elaborate literary effort, shows
</p>
<p>The grant of this boon ought to be looked upon as the 'price of our attach-
</p>
<p>ment and gratitude, and I beg leave to be permitted to repeat, that there
</p>
<p>ynust be known no instance of its being extended to any other than those who ren-
</p>
<p>der aid and promote the interests of Spain in this part of the countnj.
</p>
<p>" I entreat you, sir, to believe, that this question of navigation is the
</p>
<p>main one on which depends the Union of the West and East, and
</p>
<p>that, if Congress can obtain the free use of the Mississippi, and if Spain
</p>
<p>should cede it without conditions, it would strengthen the Union, and
</p>
<p>would deprive Spain of all its influence on this district." [Wilkinson's
</p>

</p>
<p>the resolution of the convention that the petition from Madison and
</p>
<p>Mercer were reasonable, and that an address to Congress be drawn
</p>
<p>accordingly, and stating the names of the committee charged with
</p>
<p>preparing the address, Colonel Brown says:
</p>
<p>"At this point, and before the committees were ready with their reports,

<p>tainly strange that Marshall should not allude to while rehearsing the
</p>
<p>conduct of his enemy."
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown then publishes the resolution of .Tohn Brown, which
</p>
<p>has been already quoted, and which John Brown explained in Littell,
</p>
<p>was offered to defeat the address to the Assembly, and as a motive for

<p>that this statement is not true.* On the contrary, Col-
</p>
<p>onel Brown's own book contains the proof,t in that official
</p>
<p>statement, that the special committee, consisting of John
</p>
<p>Edwards, Thomas Marshall, Muter, Jouitt, Allen and
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, which had been appointed the day before to
</p>
<p>prepare " a decent and respectful address to the Assembly
</p>
<p>of Virginia for obtaining the independence of the district
</p>
<p>of Kentucky agreeable to the late resolution and recom-
</p>
<p>mendation of Congress," had, through its chairman, Ed-
</p>
<p>wards, made its report, which was read, immediately after
</p>
<p>the committee of the whole had reported the resolution
</p>
<p>for addressing Congress in accordance with the petitions
</p>
<p>from Madison and Mercer, and before the resolution of
</p>
<p>John Brown was called up by him. Colonel Brown was
</p>
<p>made aware by Littell, that an amendment to that address
</p>
<p>thus reported by the committee was offered in order to
</p>
<p>delay it ; that its consideration was postponed ; and that
</p>
<p>the resolution of his grandfather was then called up, for
</p>
<p>the purpose, as stated distinctly in Littell's pamphlet, of
</p>
<p>* After giving the resolution to prepare the address to Congress con-
</p>
<p>cerning the Mississippi, the official report, which Colonel Brown had
</p>
<p>])efore him when he made the statement above referred to, proceeds as
</p>
<p>follows, viz :
</p>
<p>" C>rdered, That a committee be appointed to prepare the said ad-
</p>
<p>dress; and a committee was appointed of Mr. Innes, Mr. Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>Mr. Marshall, Mr. Muter, Mr. Brown, Mr. Sebastian and Mr. Morrison.
</p>
<p>Mr. Edwards, from the committee appointed to draw up an address to
</p>
<p>the Assembly of Virginia for obtaining the independence of the district
</p>
<p>of Kentucky, reported that the committee had taken the matter intcv
</p>
<p>consideration and prepared an address which he read in his place, and
</p>
<p>then delivered the same in at the table, where it was again read, and an
</p>
<p>amendment thereto proposed. Ordered, That the said address, together

<p>with the amendment, do lie on the table.

<p>following resolution, viz."
</p>
<p>Then follows the resolution of John Brown, which has already been
</p>
<p>quoted. The above is copied precisely as it appears in the Appendix of
</p>
<p>the " Political Beginnings," and contradicts the statement of the author
</p>
<p>of that book, in which it is difficult to determine whether Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown's contempt for the facts or his contempt for his readers is made
</p>
<p>the more conspicuous.

<p>the death of its author, by a gentleman unacquainted with the subject.

</p>
<p>defeating that address, and to give an opportunity for
</p>
<p>urging an immediate formation of a constitution, the or-
</p>
<p>ganization of government and the dechiration of independ-
</p>
<p>ence, without a law from the Assembly for the purpose.
</p>
<p>And while Colonel Brown affirms, that " whatever mark
</p>
<p>Brown made in the convention is to be found " in that
</p>
<p>resolution, which he asserts to have been Brown's " real
</p>
<p>avowal of political priiiciple and pilan" he carefully avoids
</p>
<p>giving the explanation of that "principle and plan"
</p>
<p>aflbrded by John Brown himself in Littell. This plan
</p>
<p>was, that, " as a further inducement to adopt this resolu-
</p>
<p>tion it was stated that there was a prospect of obtaining from
</p>
<p>Spain permission to export the -produce of the country by icay
</p>
<p>of the Mississij^pi," and that, then, to show what the pros-
</p>
<p>pect was, General Wilkinson made his speech and read his
</p>
<p>memorial, and John Brown disclosed the overture of Gar-
</p>
<p>doqui ! Wilkinson, Brown, Sebastian and Innes, all knew
</p>
<p>that the " prospect of obtaining from Spain the permission "
</p>
<p>in question was made contingent upon the separation of
</p>
<p>Kentucky from the United States, which Wilkinson had
</p>
<p>engaged with Miro to promote, and John Brown had
</p>
<p>promised Gardoqui to " aid." The first step to be taken
</p>
<p>in the accomplishment of that separation from the Union
</p>
<p>was to separate from Virginia witliout a law for the pur-
</p>
<p>pose, to frame a constitution, organize government, de-
</p>
<p>clare independence, and assume sovereignty,  to all of
</p>
<p>which John Brown's resolution was intended as a prelimi-
</p>
<p>nary, and the effect of which would have been to place
</p>
<p>Kentucky outside of the Union. The resolution was, in
</p>
<p>fact, a redemption of Brown's promise to the Spanish
</p>
<p>minister. And, as an inducement for its adoption, the
</p>
<p>prospect of obtaining the navigation of the Mississippi
</p>
<p>from Spain was stated ;  which John Brown knew could
</p>
<p>be realized only by a separation from the Union. The

</p>
<p>statement in Littell is, in fact, when analyzed, a confession
</p>
<p>by John Brown himself of all the charges made against
</p>
<p>him. This was, indeed, his "plan," and this his "polit-
</p>
<p>ical principle." The pretense that, after realizing that
</p>
<p>prospect in the way pointed out by Gardoqui, it was the
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 267
</p>
<p>purpose of these men to apply for admission to the Union,
</p>
<p>which woukl have forfeited the privilege thus obtained, is
</p>
<p>too transparently absurd to recpiire argument for its refu-
</p>
<p>tation. This absurdity was apparent to John Brown h.im-
</p>
<p>self; he, therefore, suppressed the Muter letter, which
</p>
<p>would have made the absurdity plain to all, conceded the
</p>
<p>condition annexed by Gardoqui, and pretended that the
</p>
<p>privilege could be had b}' Kentucky as an independent
</p>
<p>state of the Union.
</p>
<p>The reader of the " Beginnings" will not fail to note
</p>
<p>that, while mention is made of the appointment of a
</p>
<p>special committee to prepare an address to the Assembly
</p>
<p>of Virginia, of which committee Edwards was the chair-
</p>
<p>man, yet it nowhere appears that Edwards ever reported
</p>
<p>or read the address in the convention. On the contrary,
</p>
<p>the statement of this fact, which is made in the official
</p>
<p>report, is eliminated from the account given in the " Be-
</p>
<p>ginnings," in which it is stated, that the resolution of John
</p>
<p>Brown was called up " at this point," when in fact the state-
</p>
<p>ment is made in the. official report, that at " that point " Ed-
</p>
<p>wards read the address to the Assembly. Why Edwards was
</p>
<p>thus ignored is explained by the statement which appears on
</p>
<p>page 201 of the " Beginnings," in reciting the proceedings
</p>
<p>of the last day of the convention, that " the address to the
</p>
<p>Legislature of Virginia was next reported by Mr. Innes, and
</p>
<p>' agreed to nemine contradicente.' Its tone was loyal and
</p>
<p>its expressions respectful and judicious." In a note at the
</p>
<p>bottom of this same page appears this statement : " This
</p>
<p>address to the Legislature of Virginia, is given by Mar-
</p>
<p>shall (Vol. I, p. 379, edition of 1812), but he imcandidly
</p>
<p>omits to mention that his enemy, Innes, was its mover.
</p>
<p>The manuscript journal of the convention explicitly re-
</p>
<p>cites that Innes, as chairman of the committee, reported the
</p>
<p>address, " which he read in his place and delivered in to

</p>
<p>the clerk's table, where it was again twice read and
</p>
<p>amended and agreed to nemine contradicerite." There is no
</p>
<p>intimation given in this connection, that this proceeding
</p>
<p>was in the committee of the lohole, and the reader would nat-
</p>
<p>urally infer that Innes had made this report to the con-
</p>
<p>268 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>vention as chairman of the special committee charged with pre-
</p>
<p>paring the address. On page 205 this charge of unfairness
</p>
<p>and want of candor on the part of the historian is repeated :
</p>
<p>" No less unfair is Marshall's total failure to mention Ju-
</p>
<p>nes as the reporter of the address to the Legislature of Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia. That address is replete with sentences that de-
</p>
<p>clare the ardent desire of the people of the district to be
</p>
<p>received into the Union as an independent state upon the
</p>
<p>consent and recommendation of Congress. Mention of
</p>
<p>Innes as its mover and adcocate would have vindicated his
</p>
<p>patriotism, his loyalty, and his moderation, and would
</p>
<p>have disproved all the suspicions that JVlarshall cherished.
</p>
<p>And the further fact, apparent from tlie journal, that the
</p>
<p>address prepared and reported by Innes, was ' agreed to
</p>
<p>nemine contradicente,' would have suggested to a more can
</p>
<p>did historian, that he who introduced and advocated that
</p>
<p>paper did not deserve the denunciation leveled against
</p>
<p>him as a disloyal conspirator, especially as his views were
</p>
<p>supported by the unanimous vote of the convention. It
</p>
<p>might, perhaps, be suggested in excuse for such omissions
</p>
<p>that Marshall, while preparing his history, had not access
</p>
<p>to the original journals of the convention, nor accurate
</p>
<p>information of what was said and done. But he published
</p>
<p>his book in 1812, and certainly knew, after 1806, the exact
</p>
<p>text of the journals through Littell's publications made
</p>
<p>that year, and avowed to be an appeal to documentary
</p>
<p>evidence."
</p>
<p>But, if the statements of Colonel Brown are true, the
</p>
<p>historian did w^orse than this. His " History " shows that
</p>
<p>he had a copy of the official journal before him as he
</p>
<p>wrote. Yet he not only omitted to state that Innes w^as
</p>
<p>the mover, advocate, author and reporter of the address to
</p>
<p>the assembly, but he did state that it had been moved by
</p>
<p>John Edwards and seconded by Thomas Marshall, on the

</p>
<p>third day of the convention, and that Edwards had re-
</p>
<p>ported and read it to tlie convention on the fourth day,
</p>
<p>when it was amended, in order to defeat its passage. If
</p>
<p>Innes had, indeed, moved, prepared, reported and advocated
</p>
<p>this address, the fact would have demonstrated, that, in-
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 269
</p>
<p>stead of having been a coadjutor and a conspirator with
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, Sebastian and Brown, he had been the leader
</p>
<p>of the opposition to their schemes; and would, in truth,
</p>
<p>have vindicated his patriotism and loyalty against attacks
</p>
<p>from any source. And had that been true, the course of
</p>
<p>the historian in omitting to give him the credit that was
</p>
<p>his due, and assigning it to Edwards and Thomas Mar-
</p>
<p>shall, would not simply have been unfair and uncandid, but
</p>
<p>would have spread its taint of deliberate falsehood to
</p>
<p>every statement in his book, and have stamped his own
</p>
<p>character as dishonorable and infamous.
</p>
<p>But, in thus boldly assailing the fairness and " historic
</p>
<p>veracity" of the historian. Colonel Brown should at least
</p>
<p>have been careful that his own statements conformed to
</p>
<p>the facts established by the very official report which he
</p>
<p>cited, and the contents of which he unquestionably knew
</p>
<p>and understood. That report proves, that Innes w^as not,
</p>
<p>in fact, the mover of the resolution, nor its advocate, and
</p>
<p>that he neither prepared nor reported the address.^ It
</p>
<p>shows that the resolution to prepare the address was
</p>
<p>moved by John Edw^ards, and was seconded by Thomas
</p>
<p>Marshall,* on the third day of the convention. The same
</p>
<p>*The following is the official report of the proceedings relating to this
</p>
<p>resolution on Wednesday, November 5th, the third day of the conven-
</p>
<p>tion, viz.:
</p>
<p>"Ordered, That the resolution for preparing an address tp the Assem-
</p>
<p>bly of Virginia be now read, . . then the same was read, amended
</p>
<p>and agreed to as follows, viz.:

<p>"Resolved, That a committee be appointed to draw up a decent and re-
</p>
<p>spectful address to the Assembly of Virginia for obtaining an independ-
</p>
<p>ence of the district of Kentucky, agreeble to the late resolution and re-
</p>
<p>commendation of Congress, and that they prepare and report the same
</p>
<p>to the convention to-morrow. And a committee was appointed of Mr.

<p>Wilkinson."
</p>
<p>The naming of Edwards first on the committee, constituting him
</p>
<p>chairman thereof, shows that he offered the motion ; and the place of
</p>
<p>Marshall as second on the committee that he seconded it. Innes was
</p>
<p>not even on the committee, and had nothing to do with the resolution,
</p>
<p>except to try to defeat it. All the historians affirm the resolution to
</p>
<p>have been offered by Edwards and seconded by Marshall. The state-
</p>
<p>270 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>official report proves that the address itself was prepared
</p>
<p>by this committee, of which Innes was not a member, and
</p>
<p>was reported and read by its chairman, John Edwards, on
</p>
<p>the fourth day. So far from Innes having moved, pre-
</p>
<p>pared, reported, or advocated it, he was not only not a
</p>
<p>member of the committee that had the address in charge,
</p>
<p>but was one of those described by Littell as being " op-
</p>
<p>posed to it in toto." An amendment to the address was
</p>
<p>oftered in order to prevent action upon it, and then John
</p>
<p>Brown's resolution, of which Innes loas an advocate, was
</p>
<p>introduced, as explained by Littell, to defeat it alto-
</p>
<p>gether.* All this time Innes was an advocate and sup-
</p>
<p>porter of every measure designed to defeat the address
</p>
<p>to the assembly and the whole policy of applying to Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia. He was, in fact, one of those who were, as de-
</p>
<p>scribed by Littell on his own authority, opposed to the
</p>
<p>policy of that measure " in toto." On Saturday, the
</p>
<p>sixth day of the convention, after Brown's resolution had
</p>
<p>been defeated, the address to the assembly was referred
</p>
<p>to the committee of the whole, that it might there be
</p>
<p>still killed or crippled. It was not until the last day of
</p>
<p>the convention, when the conspirators knew they had
</p>
<p>failed ; that their eftbrts to corrupt the loyal heart of Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky had been futile; and when their Spanish-bought
</p>
<p>leader, Wilkinson, had been awed by the remonstrance
</p>
<p>which had been obtained and presented by Crockett ;  it
</p>
<p>was not until then, that the address to the assembly, which
</p>
<p>had been moved, drawn and reported and read by Ed-
</p>
<p>wards, was amended and adopted in the committee of the
</p>
<p>ment of Colouel Brown is without any authority, and originated in
</p>
<p>what he deemed the necessities of his case.
</p>
<p>'In this false claim that Innes had moved, advocated, prepared and read
</p>
<p>that address to the assembly, the reader will detect the motive of
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown in eliminating from his account the statement of the

<p>was read by Edwards on the fourth day of the convention ; and for his

<p>mittee of the whole, of the action of that committee in
</p>
<p>amending and adopting the address, which, as already

<p>vocated by Edwards, and resisted to the last by Innes,

</p>
<p>that Innes had to do with tliat address. Had Humphrey

<p>toric veracity," as Colonel Brown has shown himself to
</p>
<p>have been. It is unnecessary that the reader shall pro-
</p>
<p>ceed to pass judgment upon Colonel Brown by the stand-
</p>
<p>ard he applied to Humphrey Marshall in his own mis-
</p>
<p>representation of the facts and of the record. His own
</p>
<p>judgment of his own performance may be read in his
</p>
<p>own unjust accusations against the fairness and candor
</p>
<p>of the historian. And if Innes can only be vindicated
</p>
<p>by so gross a misrepresentation of all the facts, his case
</p>
<p>is, indeed, as desperate as Colonel Brown evidently re-
</p>
<p>garded it Avhen he resorted to this line of defense.
</p>
<p>During the controversy of 1806, the villification to which
</p>
<p>the friends of Brown, Innes, Wilkinson, and Sebastian re-
</p>
<p>sorted, in default of facts and argument, drew from his
</p>
<p>family the publication of Colonel Marshall's letter to
</p>
<p>Washington. After that publication, John Brown, Innes,
</p>
<p>and Wallace made a weak attempt to break the force of
</p>
<p>the account given in that letter of the memorial of their
</p>
<p>friend Wilkinson, of John Brown's letter to Muter, and of
</p>
<p>his ambiguous allusion in the convention to his conference

<p>with Gardoqui, by alleging that Colonel Marshall's judg-
</p>
<p>ment at the time was warped by prejudice against them
</p>
<p>as the rivals and enemies of his family. They also claimed
</p>
<p>that he soon became convinced of the injustice of his sus-
</p>
<p>picions, and in a second letter to Washington had retracted
</p>
<p>272 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>what he liacl Written in the first. In the ninth chapter ot
</p>
<p>Littell it was alleged as the " true state of those transac-
</p>
<p>tions," that
</p>
<p>" Colonel Marshall considered General Wilkinson and Mr. Brown as
</p>
<p>the popular rivals and personal enemies of his family. He became sus-
</p>
<p>picious, and communicated his suspicions to the Executive of the United
</p>
<p>States. Upon better consideration and strict observation of the conduct
</p>
<p>of these gentlemen, he became convinced that his suspicions were not
</p>
<p>well founded, and that whatever ill-will they might have against him
</p>
<p>and his connections, they had none against the United States ; and with
</p>
<p>a magnanimity which all parties must approbate, informed the Execu-
</p>
<p>tive that the suspicions he once had against them no longer existed."
</p>
<p>In other places in that pamphlet substantially the same
</p>
<p>statement is repeated. There never was any political or
</p>
<p>other rivalry between either Wilkinson or Brown and
</p>
<p>Colonel Marshall, nor any political collision between them
</p>
<p>except in his successful efforts to counteract their schemes
</p>
<p>before the people, and to defeat their plots in the conven-
</p>
<p>tion. So far from cherishing any personal animosity
</p>
<p>against Wilkinson on account of the debate between the
</p>
<p>latter and Humphrey Marshall, in 1786, the nature of
</p>
<p>which has been stated, Colonel Marshall, a few months
</p>
<p>after, recommended him, in conjunction with Isaac Shelby
</p>
<p>and Colonel R. C. Anderson, as suitable persons to treat
</p>
<p>with the Indians, for which duty all three were well quali-
</p>
<p>fied. There had been, however, a personal altercation be-
</p>
<p>tween Wilkinson and Colonel Marshall, growing, as stated
</p>
<p>by a son of the latter, out of " persistent attempts of Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson to translate Colonel Marshall's property to him-
</p>
<p>self," and the latter's refusal to have any business transac-
</p>
<p>tion with a man who damaged every one who trusted him.
</p>
<p>But no one who will read Wilkinson's letters to Miro Avill
</p>
<p>contend for a moment that the statement affecting him or
</p>
<p>his memorial made by Colonel Marshall was in the least

<p>degree colored by prejudice.
</p>
<p>There had been a violent difference between Hary Innes
</p>
<p>and some of his connections and Humphrey Marshall, in
</p>
<p>1788, in which neither Colonel Marshall nor any other mem-
</p>
<p>ber of his family had any share or participation. Besides, the
</p>
<p>name of Innes was not even so much as mentioned, nor is
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 273
</p>
<p>there the most distant allusion to him, in Colonel Marshall's
</p>
<p>letter. There had been no political or other rivalry be-
</p>
<p>tween Brown and Colonel Marshall, or Humphrey Mar-
</p>
<p>shall, or any other member of that family. The fact is,
</p>
<p>that when those events were transpiring, Colonel Marshall
</p>
<p>had but two sons in Kentucky : Alexander Keith, who
</p>
<p>was but eighteen, and Louis, who was but fifteen years
</p>
<p>old when that letter was written. It appears from the
</p>
<p>letter of Muter, pubhshed in 1790, that James M. Marshall
</p>
<p>was not in the district when the letter of John Brown was
</p>
<p>received, and even if he had settled in Kentucky when
</p>
<p>the letter to Washington was written, he had not been
</p>
<p>here long enough to have had any political rivalry with
</p>
<p>any one. The race he made against John Brown for Con-
</p>
<p>gress did not take place until the summer of 1790, eighteen
</p>
<p>months after the date of the letter, which these men al-
</p>
<p>leged to have been the emanation of jealousy and per-
</p>
<p>sonal spleen. With these facts, the men who induced Lit-
</p>
<p>tell to publish the untruth, who paid him for writing the
</p>
<p>untruth, and who gave it circulation, were well acquainted.
</p>
<p>The facts were stated in Colonel Marshall's letter as they
</p>
<p>existed and without coloring. The conclusions drawn
</p>
<p>from the facts related were irresistible. The letter ought
</p>
<p>to have been written. The time of writing it was oppor-
</p>
<p>tune. It was seemly and right that the duty was per-
</p>
<p>formed by the man who accepted the responsibility. It
</p>
<p>was not written as a matter of gossip, but to make known
</p>
<p>the situation to one who had been chosen as the Chief
</p>
<p>Executive. And the names of the two men whose direct
</p>
<p>dealings with the Spaniards, and whose engagements to
</p>
<p>further the Spanish designs, were made apparent by their
</p>
<p>own writings and utterances, were alone mentioned.
</p>
<p>The claim that Colonel Marshall had, in his letter of
</p>
<p>September 11, 1790, retracted what he had written on the

<p>12th of February, 1789, was founded on a passage in
</p>
<p>Washington's repl}', which read as follows :
</p>
<p>" Philadelphia, 6 February, 1791.
</p>
<p>Sir:  In acknowledging the receipt of your letter of the 11th of Septem-
</p>
<p>ber, I must beg you to accept my thanks for the pleasing communication it
</p>
<p>18
</p>
<p>274 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>contains of the good disposition of the people of Kentucky towards the
</p>
<p>government of the United States.
</p>
<p>I never doubted that the operations of this government, if not per-
</p>
<p>verted by prejudice or evildesigns, would inspire the citizens of America
</p>
<p>with such confidence in it, as efiectually to do away those apprehen-
</p>
<p>sions, which, under the former confederation, our best men entertained
</p>
<p>of divisions among ourselves, or allurements from other nations. I am
</p>
<p>therefore happy to find, that such a disposition prevails in your part of
</p>
<p>the country, as to remove any idea of that evil, which a few years ago
</p>
<p>you so much dreaded." [Sparks Life and Writings of Washington, Vol..
</p>
<p>X, page 137.]
</p>
<p>General Washington's mention of the " pleasing commu-
</p>
<p>nication " contained in Colonel Marshall's letter of Septem-
</p>
<p>ber 11, 1790, " of the good disposition of the j^^ople of Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky," was deceitfully construed by Brown, Innes, and
</p>
<p>Wallace as evidence that Colonel Marshall had, in the let-
</p>
<p>ter to which AVashingtou's was a reply, either retracted
</p>
<p>his statement of facts in regard to the memorial of WW-
</p>
<p>kinson and the letter and speech of Brown, and admitted
</p>
<p>himself to have been a falsifier ; or else that he had stulti-
</p>
<p>fied himself by writing that the irresistible conclusions he
</p>
<p>had expressed were unwarranted by those facts ;  for the
</p>
<p>claim that he had retracted meant nothing if it did not
</p>
<p>mean one or the other. But that Colonel Marshall's state-
</p>
<p>ment of the good disposition of the people of Kentucky, in
</p>
<p>1790, did not warrant the inference that he had retracted
</p>
<p>what he had written concerning the memorial, letters,,
</p>
<p>speeches and actions of Brown and Wilkinson, in 1788, i&
</p>
<p>too patent for argument. That it was altogether a false
</p>
<p>and absurd inference was well known by the men who
</p>
<p>used it as a screen.
</p>
<p>Brown, Innes, and Wallace all knew that this let-
</p>
<p>ter of Colonel Marshall of the 11th of September, 1790,
</p>
<p>which they claimed to have been a retraction, was written

</p>
<p>immediately after the election in which John Brown and
</p>
<p>Colonel Marshall's son, James M. Marshall, were the op-
</p>
<p>posing candidates for Congress ; that James M. Marshall,.
</p>
<p>whose judgment was naturally influenced by the opinion ot
</p>
<p>one of his father's strong mind and character, had in that
</p>
<p>canvass openly charged that John Brown and Wilkinson
</p>
<p>had been engaged in a treasonable conspiracy to separate
</p>
<p>The Spanish Co?}spiracy. 275
</p>
<p>Kentucky from tlie Uuioii and to form an alliance with
</p>
<p>Spain ; and that he had been on the point of fighting a
</p>
<p>duel with James Brown, because, when he stated the con-
</p>
<p>tents of John Brown's letter to Muter as the basis of the
</p>
<p>charge, James Brown had denied that such a letter had
</p>
<p>been written and had imputed to him a disregard of truth.
</p>
<p>They knew that the one thing in the world more im-
</p>
<p>probable than that James M. Marshall had made those
</p>
<p>charges after his honored father had changed his opinion
</p>
<p>and confessed his error, was, that, immediately after such
</p>
<p>a charge had been made by his son in public, under the
</p>
<p>influence of his own boldly expressed opinions, Colonel
</p>
<p>Marshall should have written a private letter to Washing-
</p>
<p>ton retracting his own previous statements and acknowl-
</p>
<p>edging himself to have been mistaken ! The absurdity of
</p>
<p>the claim must have diverted the men in whose behalf it
</p>
<p>was made. For they knew that at the time Colonel Mar-
</p>
<p>shall wrote the letter of February 12, 1789, which they
</p>
<p>claimed was dictated by a spirit of animosity towards
</p>
<p>Brown and Wilkinson as the political rivals of his family,
</p>
<p>there had never been such a rivalry. The}'- knew, too, that
</p>
<p>the letter, w^hich they asserted was one of retraction and
</p>
<p>admission of previous injustice, was written w^ithin a few
</p>
<p>weeks after that rivalry had commenced. These men
</p>
<p>knew from the contempt which Colonel Marshall took no
</p>
<p>pains to conceal, and from his bearing toward them during
</p>
<p>all the remainder of his life, that the opinions he had
</p>
<p>avowed to their faces much more explicitly than they were
</p>
<p>stated in his guarded letter to Washington, had undergone
</p>
<p>neither change nor modification ; and every fact demon-
</p>
<p>strates their positive knowledge, that in all they caused to
</p>
<p>be written and published on the subject there was not one
</p>
<p>word of truth.

<p>as they appear in Littell, Colonel John Mason Brown as-
</p>
<p>serts in the "Political Beginnings" that:
</p>
<p>" It M'as but a short time before Thomas Marshall very clearly saw
</p>
<p>how unjust were his suspicions, and he very honorably repaired what-
</p>
<p>ever injury his letter of I'ith of February might have done. He soon
</p>
<p>276 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>became convinced that he had wronged both Brown and Innes, and on
</p>
<p>the 11th of September, 1790, wrote to Washington assuring him of the
</p>
<p>entire absence of sedition or appearance of it, and of the ' good disposi-
</p>
<p>tion of the people of Kentucky toward the government of the United
</p>
<p>States.'"*
</p>
<p>Here is a distinct statement by Colonel Brown that
</p>
<p>Colonel Marshall in a short time saw the injustice he had
</p>
<p>done to John Brown and Hary Innes in his letter to
</p>
<p>"Washington, of February 12, 1789 (in which he knew per-
</p>
<p>fectly well that there was not the slightest allusion to
</p>
<p>Innes); and that in his letter of 11th of September, 1790,
</p>
<p>he had repaired the injustice  of course by a withdrawal.
</p>
<p>In a note at the bottom of the page on which this was
</p>
<p>written in the " Political Beginnings " (page 211) Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown cites his readers to page 520 of the Appendix to
</p>
<p>Butler's History of Kentucky, edition of 1836, for Col-
</p>
<p>onel Marshall's letter of February 12, 1789; and on page
</p>
<p>208 he quotes the conclusion of that letter which is
</p>
<p>printed on page 522 of the same book, to which he refers.
</p>
<p>On the very next page, (523) of that book, of that edition,
</p>
<p>and in the same leaf which contained the part of the first
</p>
<p>letter quoted by Colonel Brown, appeared Colonel Mar-
</p>
<p>shall's second letter to Washington  the letter of Septem-
</p>
<p>ber 11, 1790 the letter which Colonel Brown's grand-
</p>
<p>father and Colonel Brown himself affirm was a letter of
</p>
<p>retraction,  a letter in which they allege he very honor-
</p>
<p>ably repaired the previous injustice he had done by accu-
</p>
<p>rately describing the contents of Brown's letter to ]Muter
</p>
<p>and relating BroAvn's ambiguous and shirking words in
</p>
<p>the convention ! This letter was printed in the very book
</p>
<p>used by Colonel Brown. Whether he had read and knew
</p>
<p>its contents, and well comprehended their purport, when he
</p>
<p>coolly and deliberately wrote the description of it which
</p>
<p>appears in the "Political Beginnings," the reader can con-

</p>
<p>clude for himself. His grandfather and Haiy Innes did
</p>
<p>not have the letter itself before them, but disingenuously
</p>
<p>drew from AVashington's reply what they knew to be a
</p>
<p>false implication and a forced and absurd inference. But

<p>The Spanish Conspiracy/. 277
</p>
<p>in the very book which Colonel Brown used and studied,
</p>
<p>and on the next page to the page, and on the same leaf, that
</p>
<p>contained the extract which he quoted from the letter of
</p>
<p>February 12, 1789, is also published the alleged letter of
</p>
<p>retraction of September 11, 1790. Colonel Brown did not
</p>
<p>refer his readers to Butler for the second letter. He did
</p>
<p>not let them know that it had been obtained from Dr.
</p>
<p>Jared Sparks and had been published by Butler on page
</p>
<p>523 of that edition of his History (1836). That fact, as
</p>
<p>well as the letter itself, he suppressed. Was or was not
</p>
<p>the reason he did this because that letter on its own face
</p>
<p>shows that all that his grandfather, and Innes and Wal-
</p>
<p>lace procured to be written and published concerning
</p>
<p>that letter, and all that he himself wrote in regard to it,
</p>
<p>was untrue. The letter is reproduced exactly as it appears
</p>
<p>in Butler, exactly as Colonel Brown, if he was not the
</p>
<p>most careless reader in the world, and unless all appear-
</p>
<p>ances deceive,  read, knew and understood its contents,
</p>
<p>viz :
</p>
<p>Woodford County, September 11, 1790.
</p>
<p>;S7/-;  I have taken the Hberty to inclose you a Kentucky paper
</p>
<p>wherein is pubHshed an extract from one of Mr. Brown's letters re-
</p>
<p>specting the Spanish business. My reason for doing this is, that you
</p>
<p>may judge how far it confirms a representation I formerly had the
</p>
<p>honor to make you on that subject. The part I then publicly took in
</p>
<p>this affair has entirely excluded me from any knowledge of his subse-
</p>
<p>quent communications to his confidential friends.
</p>
<p>You will discover by the paper I send you to what lengths matters
</p>
<p>have been carried. Every thing relative to this matter on the part of
</p>
<p>Mr. Brown, has, by his friends and coadjutors, been denied or con-
</p>
<p>cealed, which has produced a necessity for the inclosed publication. I
</p>
<p>shall only take the liberty of adding that a great majority of the people
</p>
<p>of this district appear to be well disposed to the government of the
</p>
<p>United States, though they have, through the influence and industry of

<p>his confidential friends, again elected Mr. Brown to Congress ; and that
</p>
<p>our official and influential characters having taken the oath to support
</p>
<p>the general government, together with the position the Continental
</p>
<p>troops have taken, in my opinion, leaves us little to fear at present from
</p>
<p>the machinations of any Spanish party.
</p>
<p>That God may bless and preserve you, and that the United States
</p>
<p>may long continue to enjoy the happiness of your government and pro-

</p>
<p>Avith the most respectful esteem and sincerity, your most obedient and
</p>
<p>very humble servant,
</p>
<p>T. Marshall.
</p>
<p>T. IMarsluill to General Washington.
</p>
<p>, The reader, at a glance, will see that, in this letter. Col-
</p>
<p>onel Marshall inclosed to Washington the extract from
</p>
<p>John Brown's letter to Muter, which James M. Marshall
</p>
<p>had ohtained and published a few days before in the Lex-
</p>
<p>ington Gazette,  as a p>roof of the correctness with which
</p>
<p>he had described its contents in the letter of February 12,
</p>
<p>1789, That to him "a (jreat majoritij of the people'"' of
</p>
<p>Kentucky appeared to be "well disposed" toward the
</p>
<p>government,  notivithstandiri(j they had just elected a man
</p>
<p>concerning whoso conduct his opinions had undergone no
</p>
<p>change ; but who had, by denials, conceahnents, eva-
</p>
<p>sions, and subterfuges, paltry and pitiful ec^uivocation
</p>
<p>to sly treachery, incurred his unutterable contempt; a
</p>
<p>coiitem[)t, it may be remarked, which was openly ex-
</p>
<p>pressed by those who had opposed John Brown's schemes,
</p>
<p>and which was scarcely concealed by the indifferent, while
</p>
<p>that secretly entertained by his coadjutors was communi-
</p>
<p>cated by Wilkinson to Miro, and its record placed among
</p>
<p>the Spanish archives;  a contempt, it must be added,
</p>
<p>which no one ever feels for the man who, however wrong-
</p>
<p>ful his cause may be, boldly avows it in the face of the
</p>
<p>world, and, putting fortune and life to the hazard, and
</p>
<p>throwing himself, sword in hand, into the imminent
</p>
<p>breach, courageously stands b}' it to the bitter end. The
</p>
<p>letter which is claimed to be a retraction is a reiteration
</p>
<p>of the first.
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown might also have read in the same Appen-
</p>
<p>dix to Butlei' a third letter from Colonel Marshall to
</p>
<p>Washington, in which he indicated that, in 1792, he was
</p>
<p>as far from making a retraction as lie had been in 1790.

<p>The letter is as follows, viz :
</p>
<p>September 7th, 1792.
</p>
<p>Sir:  I take the liberty of writing by Captain O'Bannon, and in a few
</p>
<p>words mean to give you the names and rank of the gentlemen who are
</p>
<p>most likely to influence government and give a tone to the politics of
</p>
<p>this State. Isaac Shelby, Esq., Governor; Harry Innes, Esq. (present
</p>
<p>Judge of the Federal Court), first Judge of the High Court of Appeals;
</p>
<p>The Spanish Consinracy . 279
</p>
<p>John Brown, Esq., Senator to Congress; James Brown, Esq., Secretary;
</p>
<p>George Nicholas, Esq., Attorney General for the State ; and almost every
</p>
<p>post of power or profit in the State is filled by their friends and adher-
</p>
<p>ents. From this you may judge of my situation, who have formerly
</p>
<p>oftended some of them, and can never make concessions without vio-
</p>
<p>lating my own conscience. It is true, I want nothing which they have
</p>
<p>to bestow ; yet they can by misrepresentation vex me, by rendering me
</p>
<p>obnoxious to the people.
</p>
<p>Colonel Muter, who can never be forgiven for suffering the publica-
</p>
<p>tion of Mr. Brown's letter, has pretty severely felt the rod of power.
</p>
<p>He has been, by the choice of the Assembly of Virginia, for seven years
</p>
<p>past first Judge of the Supreme Court of the District of Kentucky, with
</p>
<p>a salary of 300 per annum, and is, without any fault alleged against
</p>
<p>him, turned down to the Court of Oyer and Terminer, where the salary,
</p>
<p>it is thought, will be very trifling, for the salary of the judges is not
</p>
<p>yet fixed.

<p>I have received a letter from Colonel Richard C. Anderson, request-
</p>
<p>ing my recommendation of him to fill the office of Commissioner of
</p>
<p>Loans, if such an ofiice should be necessary in this State. To recom-
</p>
<p>mend a gentleman to fill any office is a liberty I have never yet taken,
</p>
<p>nor do I think myself by any means authorized to do so ; but as I have
</p>
<p>had a long acquaintance with Colonel Anderson, both in the Army and
</p>
<p>since it was discharged, and have the highest opinion of his merit as an
</p>
<p>officer and a gentleman, I hope you will pardon me for being the means
</p>
<p>of his wishes having come to your knowledge.
</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, with the most cordial wishes for a long con-
</p>
<p>tinuance of your health and prosperity, Sir, your most obedient humble
</p>
<p>servant, T. Marshall.

</p>
<p>them, and who had the courage to speak and write the in-
</p>
<p>convenient truth, as well as the patriotism to do his duty.

<p>After having discharged that duty he indulged in no bick-
</p>
<p>erings with the men he had, with Muter, and the aid of,

<p>Anderson, Allen, Crockett and Edwards, so signally and

<p>completely thwarted.
</p>
<p>The most charitable reader will agree that this deflec-
</p>
<p>tion hy Colonel Brown would be most remarkable in any
</p>
<p>other author and if occurring in any other book. He
</p>
<p>must admit, however, that it is but typical of the charac-
</p>
<p>teristics which distinguish the "Political Beginnings"
</p>
<p>from every other alleged historical narrative than ever
</p>
<p>280 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>was written. Every reader must supply his own comment.
</p>
<p>The writer deems the incident of importance only so far
</p>
<p>as the devices resorted to by John Brown himself, as well
</p>
<p>as by his grandson, to suppress what Colonel Marshall had
</p>
<p>written and to make it appear that whatever he had so
</p>
<p>written he had himself retracted, exhibit the value they
</p>
<p>set upon his testimony as that of a witness who was
</p>
<p>known to be as careful as he was observant and shrewd,
</p>
<p>of a clear and strong mind, and of integrity as unim-
</p>
<p>peached as it was unimpeachable.
</p>
<p>A man of respectable talents and better educated than
</p>
<p>most of his contemporaries, John Brown was amply com-
</p>
<p>petent to defend his own reputation in any matter that
</p>
<p>was defensible. That he did not think the charges made
</p>
<p>against him nn worthy of notice is apparent from his pay-
</p>
<p>ing Littell to write in his defense, and from the various
</p>
<p>subterfuges, evasions, suppressions and flagrant misstate-
</p>
<p>ments which every-where appear in the pamphlet for
</p>
<p>which he was morally responsible. That his family and
</p>
<p>kindred had reason to regard the imputations upon his
</p>
<p>honor and patriotism as most serious and damaging, is ex-
</p>
<p>hibited by the resurrection of those old controversies more
</p>
<p>than three quarters of a century after they were waged.
</p>
<p>Every reader will deem it of strange significance, that,
</p>
<p>while he was thus assailed and denounced, publicly, from
</p>
<p>the rostrum and in the press, with specification and proof
</p>
<p>adduced to support charges broadly and fiercely made, in
</p>
<p>the very community in which he lived, John Brown, thus
</p>
<p>competent, and thus smarting under the lash, never pub-
</p>
<p>licly uttered one word, nor wrote a line over his own sig-
</p>
<p>nature, in his own vindication. His grandson' was pain-
</p>
<p>fully impressed with the terrible force of the conclusion
</p>
<p>which will naturally be drawn from this silence  most
</p>
<p>strange and unaccountable on any presumption of his con-

</p>
<p>sciousness of his own innocence. Iguoring this pregnant
</p>
<p>fact, but feeling its overwhelming weight, to neutralize its
</p>
<p>logical eftect, Colonel Brown tries to make it appear, that
</p>
<p>his grandfather did, before the committee charged with the
</p>
<p>investigation of Sebastian, repel the charges against him-
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 281
</p>
<p>self under the sanctity of his oath. He says that : " It
</p>
<p>was not till 1806 that Brown had opportunity before the
</p>
<p>legislature (?) of Kentucky, when Sebastian was under im-
</p>
<p>peachment (?) to testify under oath and repel the charge
</p>
<p>and explain his actions and his motives. From his MS.
</p>
<p>memoranda of his testimony so delivered his version can
</p>
<p>be briefly stated." * On another page, still referring to
</p>
<p>Brown's testimony before that committee he says: "And
</p>
<p>the explanation of Brown and his asseverations of the
</p>
<p>correctness of his motive and his action were given under
</p>
<p>the sanction of his oath." Colonel Brown gives the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing as his grandfather's alleged manuscript memoranda
</p>
<p>of his testimony before the committee :
</p>
<p>" The fact is," said Brown, "that from 178o, when the first convention
</p>
<p>met at Danville, on the subject of a separation from the State of Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia, till 1792, when Kentucky was admitted into the Union as a sepa-
</p>
<p>rate state, no motion was at any time made, either in convention or to
</p>
<p>the people, to separate from the Union and form an alliance with Spain ;
</p>
<p>nor was any measure to that efl'ect discussed or advocated by any man.
</p>
<p>The proposition of Mr. Gardoqui originated with himself, and was sug-
</p>
<p>gested by him in conversation on the subject of his negotiation with Mr.
</p>
<p>Jay, and was communicated by me to Colonel Muter and Colonel Mc-
</p>
<p>Dowell, Judges of the Supreme Court, in reply to letters from them re-
</p>
<p>questing whatever information! might obtain relative to that negotia-
</p>
<p>tion. At the date of my letter to Muter I intended to write letters to
</p>
<p>the same jjurport to other friends who corresponded with me, but, upon
</p>
<p>reflection, and more especially after an interesting conversation with a
</p>
<p>highly distinguished statesman of Virginia relative to Gardoqui's project,
</p>
<p>I deemed it inexpedient to make any further communication on the
</p>
<p>subject, the public mind of Kentucky being in a high state of excite-
</p>
<p>ment in consequence of the rejection of the application to be admitted
</p>
<p>into the Union as an independent state."

<p>charge made against him ; waiving also the question of its

<p>consistency with the terms of his letter to Muter, and of
</p>
<p>his own account, as given in the Littell pamphlet, of his
</p>
<p>course in the Danville convention of November, 1788 ; the
</p>
<p>fact remains that the oflicial report of his testimony be-
</p>
<p>fore that committee, to which he himself signed his name

</p>
<p>racy and utter disingenuousness of his alleged manuscript
</p>
<p>memoranda of that testimony; even if, indeed, it be true
</p>
<p>that he left any manuscript purporting to be such memo-
</p>
<p>randa. Were the natural inquiry made, why Coloiiel
</p>
<p>Brown published the alleged memoranda instead of the
</p>
<p>testimony itself, which was in his possession, the easy an-
</p>
<p>swer is, that it was because the latter did not suit his pur-
</p>
<p>pose, the testimony not containing one woi'd of the pre-
</p>
<p>tended memoranda thereof, and relating entirely to matters
</p>
<p>which occurred seven years subsequent to the events
</p>
<p>treated in the memoranda. One reading both and com-
</p>
<p>paring them with each other will see, that, wdiile the tes-
</p>
<p>timony relates exclusively to John Brown's knowledge of
</p>
<p>the " business upon which, it was said, Mr. Sebastian went
</p>
<p>to ISTew Orleans in the years 1795-6, or relative to his hav-
</p>
<p>ing received a pension from the Government of Spain,"
</p>
<p>as to the date when Brown iirst became acquainted with
</p>
<p>the fact that Sebastian was a Spanish pensioner, etc., 
</p>
<p>the memoranda, on the other hand, makes no reference to
</p>
<p>any of these matters, but refers to John Brown's own con-
</p>
<p>ference with Gardoqui in 1788, his letters to Muter and
</p>
<p>McDowell in the same year, and his motives for not making
</p>
<p>a public revelation of the overture of Gardoqui ;  which

<p>overture he himself induced Littell to publish that he had
</p>
<p>actually disclosed in the N'ovember convention.* Leav-

<p>until he read certain publications which appeared in the Wedevn World
</p>
<p>since the 4th of July last ; that in, or about, the month of August last,
</p>
<p>Mr. Innes did make a communication to this deponent relative to the
</p>

<p>wliich he gave, a pretended account of his testimony before
</p>
<p>that committee, which his own signature to his deposition
</p>
<p>proves he never did give, to be adjusted between the
</p>
<p>grandfather and the grandson ; and turning from this spec-
</p>
<p>tacle and all the painful reflections to which it gives rise,
</p>
<p>the reader will be seriously impressed by the fact, that
</p>
<p>Jolm BroAvn so utterly failed to defend himself in any
</p>
<p>public speech or writing. In his testimony before the
</p>
<p>legislative committee which investigated the charges
</p>
<p>against Sebastian, his deposition shows that he made no
</p>
<p>reference to the charges brought against himself, which
</p>
<p>charges related to the transactions of 1788. For reasons
</p>
<p>which were deemed sufficient, he was not made a witness
</p>
<p>in the suit of Innes against Street. In the suit ot Inncsv.
</p>
<p>Marshall his loyalty and integrity were impugned by the
</p>
<p>questions of the defendant, and seriously impeached by
</p>
<p>the replies of witnesses ; the most damaging assaults made
</p>
<p>upon Innes were the proofs of his intimacy with the
</p>
<p>writer of the letter to Muter ;  with the man who had the

<p>conference with Gardoqui, and made in the November

<p>then made to this deponent are, as he believes, substantially contained
</p>
<p>in the testimony delivered by Mr. Innes to this committee, he deems it
</p>
<p>unnecessary to state them ; that he heard Mr. Sebastian had been in
</p>
<p>Philadelphia on his return from New Orleans in 1796; but he did not
</p>
<p>call on this deponent, then attending Congress in that city ; and he has
</p>
<p>been informed that he did not call on any of the then members of the
</p>
<p>Kentucky delegation at that place ; that some time after Mr. Genet ar-
</p>
<p>rived at Philadelphia, and during the continuance of the war between
</p>
<p>France and Spain, he informed this deponent that he had it in contem-
</p>
<p>plation to raise an army to consist of recruits from Kentucky, Tennes-
</p>
<p>see, the Creek and other Indian tribes, for the conquest of Louisiana in
</p>
<p>behalf of France.

</p>
<p>Kentucky from the autumn of 1792, till about August, 1795 ; and, there-
</p>
<p>fore, has no personal knowledge of the progress of any agent of Genet
</p>
<p>in issuing commissions or enlisting men ; but during that time he re-

<p>convention the equivocal response to the request for in-
</p>
<p>formation. Every consideration which could appeal to-
</p>
<p>one's pride, to one's self respect, to regard for one's own
</p>
<p>reputation with future generations, and to the sincerity of
</p>
<p>his friendship for Innes, demanded that he should go
</p>
<p>upon the witness stand, and there defend his friend by
</p>
<p>vindicating himself, if he were innocent, from the charges
</p>
<p>published by Marshall in the newspapers, recorded by
</p>
<p>him on the "during marble of history," and which were
</p>
<p>spread by the man whom he hated, even as he feared
</p>
<p>him, upon the records of the courts. Yet he was never
</p>
<p>summoned, he did not volunteer, and not one public word
</p>
<p>did he utter. This silence, which would have been inex-
</p>
<p>plicable in a man who was conscious of his own innocence,
</p>
<p>that the charges against him were calumnious and could
</p>
<p>be so shown to be by making known the truth, is suscep-
</p>
<p>tible of but one logical explanation ;  that to have been

<p>subjected to a cross-examination would have reduced him

<p>to an election between two alternatives,  one of which

<p>was a confession ; and from the other, what he had of con-

<p>The movement to separate Kentucky from the United

<p>States and either to subject lier people to, or phice them
</p>
<p>under, the protection of Spain, was made known to the
</p>
<p>French minister to the United States, and was by him
</p>
<p>communicated to his court. Similar intelHgence was con-
</p>
<p>veyed to Lord Dorchester, then the governor of Canada,

<p>who promptly forwarded it to the Court of St. James.
</p>
<p>The details are even now among the Spanish archives in

<p>as well as upon the actions of their associates, by Colonel

<p>Marshall, which was also placed upon them by Allen,
</p>
<p>French, Muter, Crockett and others, at the time, was not
</p>
<p>the result of prejudice, but was eminently just. What-

<p>ever may have been the detestation felt by Humphrey

<p>Marshall for these men on personal grounds, the interpre-
</p>
<p>tation he placed upon their conduct in his History, in

<p>after years, was fully sustained by the proof; was but the
</p>
<p>repetition of official dispatches to three European powers,

<p>Out of the abundance of proof which establishes that the
</p>
<p>286 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>opinions of important contemporaries confirmed those
</p>
<p>afterwards expressed by the historian, the testimony ob-
</p>
<p>tained from the letters of the gallant General St. Clair is
</p>
<p>produced. Under date of December 5, 1788, St. Clair,
</p>
<p>who was then governor of the ^N'orth-Western Territory,
</p>
<p>wrote to Major Isaac Dunn,  Wilkinson's partner and
</p>
<p>confederate :
</p>
<p>" Dear Dunn :  I am much grieved to hear that there are strong dis-
</p>
<p>positions on the part of tlie people of Kentucky to break off their con-
</p>
<p>nection with the United States, and that our friend Wilkinson is at the
</p>
<p>liead of this affair. Such a consummation would involve the United
</p>
<p>States in the greatest difficulties, and would completely ruin this coun-
</p>
<p>try. Should there be any foundation for these reports, for God's sake,
</p>
<p>make use of your influence to detach Wilkinson from that party." *
</p>
<p>This letter was sent by Dunn to Wilkinson, and a copy
</p>
<p>thereof was forwarded by Wilkinson to Miro, as " the
</p>
<p>proof that the part which I play in our great enterprise,
</p>
<p>and the dangers to which T am exposed for the service of
</p>
<p>his Catholic Majesty, are known." (3n the 13th of De-
</p>
<p>cember, 1788, St. Clair wrote to John Jay, that, " it is
</p>
<p>certain that, in the last convention, a proposal was made
</p>
<p>that the district of Kentucky should set up for itself, not
</p>
<p>only independent of Virginia, but of the United States
</p>
<p>also, and was rejected by a small majority only." This
</p>
<p>was the construction given at the time to the intended
</p>
<p>efiect of the resolution of John Brown. Had the reso-
</p>
<p>lution and address offered by Edwards been defeated, and
</p>
<p>had that of John Brown and the policy to which its
</p>
<p>author was committed by his assurances to Gardoqui pre-
</p>
<p>vailed, then the result would have followed from which,
</p>
<p>according to St. Clair, so narrow an escape was made.
</p>
<p>The most forcible argument used in the Littell pam-
</p>
<p>phlet, and which is dutifully repeated by Colonel Brown,
</p>
<p>is founded on the alleged confidence reposed in these men

<p>by the illustrious Washington ;  from which, they eon-

<p>tend, it results that the Sage of Mt. Vernon discovered no

<p>criminality in the memorials, letters, speeches, acts and
</p>
<p>movements which were communicated to him by Colonel

</p>
<p>statement of facts, that lie altogether rejected Colonel
</p>
<p>Marshall's conclusions, or that any unfavorable impression
</p>
<p>he may for a time have had was speedily removed by
</p>
<p>Colonel Marshall's own retraction. That General Wash-
</p>
<p>ington was " greatly alarmed at the nature of the transac-
</p>
<p>tions mentioned " in Colonel Marshall's letter of Febru-
</p>
<p>ary 12, 1789, is clear from his own response. But, say the
</p>
<p>champions of the conspirators, in the face of that letter,
</p>
<p>General Washington in a few months thereafter appointed
</p>
<p>Hary Innes, Judge of the District Court for Kentucky.
</p>
<p>It happened, however, that Colonel Marshall had made no
</p>
<p>charge against Innes, nor so much as mentioned his name
</p>
<p>in the letter referred to ;  a fact of which Judge Innes,
</p>
<p>himself, Brown, and Wallace were fully aware when
</p>
<p>they caused this disingenuous defense to be made ; for the
</p>
<p>letter itself had been published before the Littell pamphlet
</p>
<p>was written. The moderation and circumspection with
</p>
<p>which that letter dealt with Wilkinson and Brown (whom
</p>
<p>alone it designated), concisely stating the facts of their
</p>
<p>dealings with the Spaniards as they appeared from their
</p>
<p>own writings and declarations, and very briefly giving his
</p>
<p>own just conclusions therefrom, can not fail to attract the
</p>
<p>attention of the reader. Whatever he may have thought
</p>
<p>of Innes as their friend and confederate, Colonel Mar-
</p>
<p>shall's opinions concerning him were not stated in that nor
</p>
<p>in any other letter he ever wrote to Washington. * As
</p>
<p>the superintendent of mines during the revolution, in
</p>
<p>which capacity his services had been valuable, Innes had
</p>
<p>been known, by reputation at least, to Washington. His
</p>
<p>elder brother. Dr. Robert Innes, a surgeon in the revolu-
</p>
<p>tion and a man of high character, had married the daugh-
</p>

<p>pointees of Shelby, " some of whom " he had " formerly offended." It
</p>
<p>does not specify Innes as one of those he had offended, nor make any
</p>
<p>charge against him. That letter was written three years after Innes

<p>was appointed by Washington.

</p>
<p>his body was immense, bad been the brave colonel of a
</p>
<p>Virginia regiment, and had but recently rendered invalu-
</p>
<p>able service in the Virginia convention by advocating the
</p>
<p>ratification of the constitution, Avhich gave scope for and
</p>
<p>an incentive to an eloquence, which in its magnificance
</p>
<p>was scarcely surpassed by that of the gifted Henry. The
</p>
<p>family was in the highest degree reputable. Hary Innes
</p>
<p>himself was a man of good private morals and of respect-
</p>
<p>able legal attainments, and had for years been identified
</p>
<p>with and prominent in the afiiairs of the district. With-
</p>
<p>out information from Colonel Marshall, or, so far as
</p>
<p>known, from any one else, of his implication wnth Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son, there were but few men in the district, to whom Wash-
</p>
<p>ington would more naturally .have looked as a suitable
</p>
<p>person for the position than the one he appointed ; and
</p>
<p>the others did not desire the place. *
</p>
<p>Much stress has also been placed upon the circumstance,
</p>
<p>that, in 1791, Washington appointed Innes and Brown, in
</p>
<p>conjunction with Isaac Shelby, General Charles Scott and
</p>
<p>Benjamin Logan, commissioners to organize the militia of
</p>
<p>the district for an oftensive movement against tlie Indians
</p>
<p>" The construction placed by Wilkinson upon Washington's motive
</p>
<p>in making this appointment appears in his letter to Miro, of January 26,
</p>
<p>1790. As it is amusing as well as instructive, the passage is here quoted
</p>
<p>from Gayarre, page 278, viz :
</p>
<p>" On my arrival here, I discovered a great change in those who had
</p>
<p>been so far our warmest friends. Many, who loudly repudiated all con-
</p>
<p>nection with the Union, now remain silent. I attribute this, either to
</p>
<p>the hope of promotion or to the fear of punishment. According to my
</p>
<p>prognostic, Washington has begun to operate on the chief heads of this
</p>
<p>district. Innes has been appointed a federal judge with an annual sal-
</p>
<p>ary of one thousand dollars ; George Nicholas, district attorney ; Samuel
</p>
<p>McDowell, son of the president of the convention, and Marshall, have
</p>
<p>been appointed to offices somewhat resembling that of Alguazil Mayor ;

<p>and Payton Short, the brother of our charge d'affaires at Versailles, is
</p>
<p>made a custom-house officer. But he has resigned, and probably will
</p>
<p>visit you in the spring. I do not place much reliance on George Nicho-
</p>
<p>las and Samuel McDowell. But I know that Harry Innes is friendly to
</p>
<p>Spain and hostile to Congress, and I am authorized to say that he would much
</p>
<p>prefer receiving a pension from New Orleans than from New York. Should
</p>
<p>the king approve our design on this point, it will have to be broached

<p>with much delicacy, caution and judgment," etc.

<p>of the North-west. But, at this time, he had been in-
</p>
<p>formed by the letter of Marshall of the " good disposition
</p>
<p>of the great majority of the people of Kentucky " towards
</p>
<p>the general government, and that little was then to be ap-
</p>
<p>prehended from the " machinations of the Spanish party."
</p>
<p>Brown was the Congressman from the district ; he had
</p>
<p>been activ^e in urging the measure ; and he was capable of
</p>
<p>being useful in the organization of the expedition. The
</p>
<p>eminently wise and practical Washington was anxiously
</p>
<p>laboring to conciliate all the factions and make it their
</p>
<p>interest to support the new government ; and, safely sand-
</p>
<p>wiched between Scott, Shelby and old Ben. Logan, there
</p>
<p>was not a particle of danger that Brown or any one else
</p>
<p>could turn over to the Spaniards the force raised for ser-
</p>
<p>vice against the red men, even had he desired to do so
</p>
<p>never so earnestly. It will be seen there were abundant
</p>
<p>reasons for giving Brown the place he sought without at-
</p>
<p>tributing it to the slightest confidence reposed in him by
</p>
<p>Washington.
</p>
<p>Then Wilkinson was appointed to a Lieutenant Col-
</p>
<p>onelcy by Washington in the fall of 1791, and by success-
</p>
<p>ive promotions reached the head of the army ; and it is
</p>
<p>stoutly asserted that he could never have received this
</p>
<p>appointment had a vestige of the suspicion engendered by
</p>
<p>Colonel Marshall's letter remained upon the mind of the
</p>
<p>President. That Wilkinson was as guilty and as base as
</p>
<p>Colonel Marshall believed him to have been, as unscrupu-
</p>
<p>lous a traitor and as false and corrupt a scoundrel as
</p>
<p>Humphrey Marshall, or Clark, or Power, or Adair, or
</p>
<p>Randolph ever charged him with having been, no one
</p>
<p>who reads his letters to Miro and Gardoqui can for one
</p>
<p>moment doubt. But that does not aifect the question of
</p>
<p>what Washington thought of him at the time. However,

<p>and Washington a few years later, on the subject of Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson's promotion, may be gathered their appreciative
</p>
<p>knowledge of his character, their suspicions of his treach-
</p>

<p>which Washington sometimes felt compelled to act in

<p>dealing witli men like Brown and Wilkinson. Unwel-
</p>
<p>come as the revelation may be to those who fail to realize
</p>
<p>the embarrassments nnder which the clear sighted, pure
</p>
<p>and patriotic sometimes thought it prudent to seem to
</p>
<p>trust the deceitful and treacherous, it nevertheless eft'ectu-
</p>
<p>ally disposes of all this flimsy superstructure built upon a
</p>
<p>quicksand :
</p>
<p>The insolence and continued outrages of the French
</p>
<p>Revolutionary government, compelled President John
</p>
<p>Adams, in 1799, to prepare for war. Congress authorized
</p>
<p>the enlistment often thousand men as a provisional army.
</p>
<p>General Washington was appointed Commander-in-Chief
</p>
<p>and Alexander Hamilton, Inspector General, to be second
</p>
<p>in command to Washington. These two able men wci-e
</p>
<p>busily occupied in the details of recruiting and organizing
</p>
<p>the new army. While those labors were in progress,
</p>
<p>Hamilton, under date of June 15, 1799, wrote to Wash-
</p>
<p>ington a letter from which the following is an extract, viz :
</p>
<p>" I liave just received a letter from General Wilkinson, dated the loth
</p>
<p>of Api'il, in which lie assures me that he will set out in the ensuing
</p>
<p>month for the seat of government. The interview with him will be
</p>
<p>useful. It strikes nie forcibly, that it will be both right and expedient
</p>
<p>to advance this gentleman to the grade of a Major General. He has
</p>
<p>been long steadily in service, and long a Brigadier. This, in so consid-
</p>
<p>erable an extension of the military establishment, gives him a preten-
</p>
<p>sion to promotion. I am aware that some doubts have been entertained of
</p>
<p>him, and that his character, on certain sides, gives room for doubts. Yet he is
</p>
<p>a,t present in the service ; is a man of more than ordinary talent, cour-
</p>
<p>age and enterprise ; has discovered upon various occasions a good zeal ;
</p>
<p>has embraced military pursuits as a profession., and vnll naturally find his in-
</p>
<p>terest as an ambitious man, in deserving the favor of the government, while
</p>
<p>he will be apt to be become disgusted if neglected, and through disgust may
</p>
<p>be rendered really what lie is now only suspected to be. Under such cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances it seems to me good policy to avoid all just ground of dis-

<p>content, and to make it the interest of the individual to practice his duty. If
</p>
<p>you should be also of this opinion, I submit to your consideration
</p>
<p>whether it would not be advisable to express it in a private letter to the
</p>
<p>Secretary of War."
</p>
<p>From Washington's answer to this letter the following
</p>
<p>extract is taken :
</p>
<p>"I think, with you, that policy dictates the expediency of promoting Brigadier
</p>
<p>Wilkinson to the rank of Major General, and will suggest the measure to the
</p>
<p>Secretart/ of War in a private communication. It tuould feed his ambition,
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 291
</p>
<p>soothe his vanity, and, by arresting discontent, produce the good effect, you con-
</p>
<p>template." *
</p>
<p>It is mortifying to reflect that the same views of policy
</p>
<p>have, ill this and in all other countries, in all ages, fre-
</p>
<p>quently influenced the greatest and best men who have
</p>
<p>been charged with the conduct of public aflairs. But,
</p>
<p>whatever may be thought of the wisdom of thus promot-
</p>
<p>ing a man known to be untrustworthy and treacherous, in
</p>
<p>order to buy his fidelity, there can be no question that, in
</p>
<p>point of fact, Washington had no confidence in the integ-
</p>
<p>rity of Wilkinson, and that his appointment by Washing-
</p>
<p>ton to a command in the array did not prove either that the
</p>
<p>latter discredited the statements of facts or the conclusions
</p>
<p>of Colonel Marshall, or that he did not esteem the con-
</p>
<p>duct of Wilkinson and Brown as highly culpable. Wilk-
</p>
<p>inson himself was aware that he was distrusted by Wash-
</p>
<p>ington, and was closely watched by the able, gallant and
</p>
<p>loyal Wayne.

<p>All cireuiustances combine to prove, that, from a time

<p>commencing soon aftcM- the close of the Revolntion, there
</p>
<p>were in Kentucky, in Tennessee, and in otlier sections of
</p>
<p>the West, emissaries of Great Britain, who used exertions

<p>to disatfect the people towards the Congress and the East,
</p>
<p>to the end that there might be brought about a separa-

<p>tion of the West from the United States. The letter of
</p>
<p>Thomas Green to the Governor of Georgia, and the cir-
</p>
<p>cular distributed throughout the West, in December,
</p>
<p>1786, and which stated that, " Great Britain stands ready

<p>tablished. In corroboration of the statement in this cir-
</p>
<p>cular, Mr. Madison wrote to Jefferson, on the 19th of
</p>
<p>March, 1787: "It is hinted to me that British partisans
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 293
</p>
<p>are already feeling the pulse of some of the western set-
</p>
<p>tlements ;" and the " measures for uniting their consulta-
</p>
<p>tions " in the West, of which Mr. Madison had informa-
</p>
<p>tion, and some of the developments of which may be read
</p>
<p>in the circular letter from Western Pennsylvania, and in
</p>
<p>the call of March 19, 1787, seem much like a movement
</p>
<p>in the direction of what Mr. Madison anticipated as the
</p>
<p>ultimate result of those measures. Wilkinson also, in
</p>
<p>his memorial to the Intendant of Louisiana, asserted that,
</p>
<p>if Spain was so blind to her own interest as to reject
</p>
<p>the proposition made to her by a people whom he de-
</p>
<p>scribed as on the point of separating from the Union
</p>
<p>forever, " Great Britain stands ready, with her arms ex-
</p>
<p>panded, willing to receive and co-operate with them in
</p>
<p>their desire to open the navigation of the Mississippi ;"
</p>
<p>and, to enforce what he had written, repeated a conver-
</p>
<p>sation he had had with a British member of Parliament
</p>
<p>on the subject. To Gardoqui, in a letter dated January
</p>
<p>1, 1789, he wrote that, in case his intended propositions to
</p>
<p>Spain had been rejected by Navarro and Miro, it had been
</p>
<p>his purpose " to open negotiations with Great Britain, lohich
</p>
<p>had been already activk m the matter."* This shows
</p>
<p>that, prior to his visit to N'ew Orleans, in June, 1787, he
</p>
<p>had already been in consultation and correspondence with
</p>
<p>British authorities in reference to the separation of Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky from the United States and an alliance with Great
</p>
<p>Britain, and was one of the persons who had been ap-
</p>
<p>proached by British partisans, as had been hinted to Mad-
</p>
<p>ison. Gardoqui's dispatch mentions those British in-
</p>
<p>trigues.
</p>
<p>In one of the articles published in the Western World,
</p>
<p>and which was reproduced in the Lexington Gazette, of
</p>
<p>July 12, 1806, it was stated that Wilkinson had been ap-
</p>
<p>proached by these" British partisans" and had made a

<p>both Madrid and Paris were looking to a separation of

</p>
<p>ticipated action for their own advancement. Said the
</p>
<p>article : "While Lord Dorchester, the Governor of Canada,
</p>
<p>Avas impressed with a similar view by the ministry of Great
</p>
<p>Britain; a- copy of Wilkinson's report was transynitted to
</p>
<p>Lord Dorchester, lohich is probably yet in that nobleman's
</p>
<p>possession; but another manuscript is preserved in the pri-
</p>
<p>vate library of the Earl of Bute, at his family seat of
</p>
<p>Mount Stuart in Scotland." From the connection in
</p>
<p>which this statement was made in the Western World, the
</p>
<p>present writer infers that the editor intended to be under-
</p>
<p>stood, that this report was made by Wilkinson prior to his
</p>
<p>trip to New Orleans and engagement with Miro. How-
</p>
<p>ever that may be, the statement was positively made, and
</p>
<p>beyond question was not manufactured, but was based
</p>
<p>upon information. That Wilkinson had conferred with
</p>
<p>British emissaries before his trip to New Orleans, and was
</p>
<p>then as ready to negotiate with them as he did with Miro
</p>
<p>during that trip, is established by his own writings.
</p>
<p>The attention of the reader is now requested to the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing dispatch from Dorchester to Lord Sydney, viz.:
</p>
<p>Quebec, 11th April, 1789.
</p>
<p>My Lord:  I am informed the Spanish Government at New Orleans
</p>
<p>has, for some time past, observed a very friendly conduct towards the
</p>
<p>inhabitants of Kentucky.
</p>
<p>Special permits have been put into the hands of some of the leading
</p>
<p>characters of those settlements for sending down the Mississippi deter-
</p>
<p>minate quantities of tobacco, which are purchased at New Orleans on
</p>
<p>account of the Government, and ten thousand dollars have been issued
</p>
<p>from tlie public treasury there for the purpose of purchasing merchan-
</p>
<p>dise in Kentucky, which sum has been consigned to gentlemen of that
</p>
<p>country, and is actually arrived at the Falls of the Ohio.
</p>
<p>The Spanish territories upon the Mississippi, between the thirty-first
</p>
<p>and thirty-third degrees of north latitude, are erected into a Lieuten-
</p>
<p>ancy, dependent on New Orleans, a governor has been appointed, and

<p>all Americans are invited to settle there under flattering offers.
</p>
<p>A Monsieur d'Arges, a Knight of the Order of St. Louis, who has been
</p>
<p>a resident of Kentucky for near a year, and in the employ of the Span-
</p>
<p>ish Government, is said to have advised this measure at the Court of
</p>
<p>Madrid, v.liere he has had several audiences since he left Kentucky.
</p>
<p>On the west side of the Mississippi, opposite the mouth of the Ohio,
</p>
<p>another Spanish settlement is intended with similar views, under the
</p>
<p>agency of a IVIr. Morgan, formerly a merchant at Philadelphia, who is
</p>
<p>now upon the Ohio.
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 295
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the favorable answer given by Congress to the de-
</p>
<p>mand of Kentucky to be admitted a sovereign State in the Union, the
</p>
<p>people of that conntry have lately discovered a strong inclination to an
</p>
<p>entire separation, and some of their leading men have entered into cor-
</p>
<p>respondence with the Spanish Government at New Orleans.
</p>
<p>Their apprehension that Congress will consent to give up the naviga-
</p>
<p>tion of the Mississippi for twenty-five years is one of the reasons which
</p>
<p>induces them to listen to the overtures of Spain.
</p>
<p>In a late convention, held at Danville, it has been proposed by those
</p>
<p>who are gained over to the Spanish views to throw themselves under
</p>
<p>the protection of that power.
</p>
<p>But the general result of more private councils among them is said to
</p>
<p>be to declare independence of the Federal Union, take possession of
</p>
<p>New Orleans and look to Great Britain for such assistance as might
</p>
<p>enable them to accomplish these designs.
</p>
<p>A committee of private correspondence has been appointed by them to
</p>
<p>influence all the inhabitants west of the mountains in the same measure.
</p>
<p>I inclose some of tln'ir political reflexions on the state of aflairs in the
</p>
<p>western country.
</p>
<p>A new American settlement is now forming at the mouth of the Great
</p>
<p>Miami, on the north side of the Ohio, conducted by a Mr. Symmes, a
</p>
<p>late member of Congress, and covered by a garrison of one hundred
</p>
<p>and fifty Continental troops.

<p>I am, with much respect and esteem, your Lordship's most obedient
</p>
<p>and most humble servant,
</p>
<p>DOUCHESTER.

<p>The Right Hon'ble Lord Sydney.*
</p>
<p>The reader will observe from the entire tenor of this
</p>
<p>dispatch, that Dorchester's expectations and hopes rested
</p>
<p>entirely upon those who were dissatisfied with the Union,
</p>
<p>who had but recently made an eftbrt to withdraw from
</p>
<p>it, and who were balancing, as he supposed, between
</p>
<p>an alliance with Spain to obtain from her the navigation
</p>
<p>of the Mississippi ; and one with Great Britain, and, with

<p>the aid of the latter power, to drive out the S})anish and

<p>tecedent to which the pronoun " them " in the last sentence
</p>
<p>refers is manifestly the pronoun " those" in the immedi-
</p>
<p>ately preceding sentence. " Those who are gained over to

</p>
<p>convention ; but afterwards, the " result of more private
</p>
<p>councils among them " (or " those w^ho are gained over to

</p>
<p>Britain instead of to Spain. The language of Dorchester is
</p>
<p>fairly susceptible of no other construction than the mean-

<p>ing plainly conveyed by its context. It could have had
</p>
<p>no. reference to the men whose attachment to the Union

<p>in resisting Spanish designs in the November convention
</p>
<p>had been so recently and so bravely manifested. It re-

<p>1. The River Mississippi being the channel by which the Western
</p>
<p>settlements of America must export their products, we may form a just
</p>
<p>estimate of the importance of this channel by casting our eyes over a
</p>
<p>map comprehending that vast and luxuriant Country watered by its
</p>
<p>branches.
</p>
<p>2. As the balance inclines the beam, the Atlantic States of America
</p>
<p>must sink as the Western settlements rise. Nature has interposed ob-
</p>
<p>stacles and established barriers between these regions which forbid their
</p>
<p>connexion on principles of reciprocal interests, and the flimsy texture
</p>
<p>of republican government is insufficient to hold in the same political
</p>
<p>bonds a people detached and scattered over such an expanse of territory,
</p>
<p>whose views and interests are discordant.
</p>
<p>3. Thus local causes, irresistible in their nature, must produce a se-
</p>
<p>cession of the Western settlements from the Atlantic States, and the
</p>
<p>period is not very distant. But these people must for ages continue ag-
</p>
<p>ricultural ; of consequence foreign protection will be expedient to their

<p>happiness,' and this protection must necessarily comprehend the right of
</p>
<p>navigating the Mississippi, with a marine to protect its commerce. That
</p>
<p>power which commands the navigation of the Mississippi as completely
</p>
<p>commands the whole country traversed by its waters as the key does
</p>
<p>the lock, the citadel the out-works.
</p>
<p>4. The Politics of the Western Country are verging fast to a crisis,
</p>
<p>and must speedily eventuate in an appeal to the patronage of Spain or
</p>
<p>Britain. No interruption can be apprehended from Congress ; the sedi-

<p>tious temper and jarring interests of the Atlantic States forbid general

</p>
<p>ity, distraction, and capricious policy which a high-toned monan^hy can
</p>
<p>alone remedy ; but the revolutions and changes necessary to rec^oncile
</p>
<p>the people to such a government must involve much delay. (Ireat
</p>
<p>Britain ought to prej^are for the occasion, and she should employ the

</p>
<p>The pronouns ''those,'' "-them" and ''their,'' employed
</p>
<p>by Dorchester in four consecutive sentences of the dis-
</p>
<p>patch which refer to the above paper, all used in the
</p>
<p>same immediate connection, unmistakably relate to the
</p>
<p>same party. There was no other party than the one
</p>
<p>which had " lately discovered a strong inclination to an entire
</p>
<p>separation, and some of whose leading men have entered into
</p>
<p>correspondence ivith the Spanish governmevt at New Orleans " 
</p>
<p>the party led by Wilkinson, Brown, Sebastian and Innes,
</p>
<p> mentioned in the dispatch, nor any other to whom Dor-
</p>
<p>chester's words could possibly have liad reference. To the
</p>
<p>writer the paper appears, on its face, to have been written
</p>
<p>before the engagement of Wilkinson with Miro and prior
</p>
<p>to the overture of Gardoqui which John Brown promised
</p>
<p>to " aid ; "  because it speaks of " an appeal to the patron-
</p>
<p>age of Spain or Britain " as something in the future 
</p>
<p>that " must speedily eventuate." This impression is
</p>
<p>strengthened by the fact, that, although the dispatch of
</p>
<p>Dorchester in which it was inclosed is dated in April,
</p>
<p>1789, yet both this dispatch and the " reflexions " are
</p>
<p>published in the Archives in pages which precede dis-
</p>
<p>patches of a later date which inclosed papers that were
</p>
<p>unquestionably written in 1787. But, whether or not the
</p>
<p>writer is correct in this  whether the " reflexions " were
</p>
<p>written in 1787, or after the November convention of 1788

<p> the letter of Dorchester and the " reflexions" themselves
</p>
<p>alike show, that they emanated from some one of the men
</p>
<p>who had disclosed their purpose in the November conven-
</p>
<p>tion to separate Kentucky from the Union. It is perfectly
</p>
<p>* This paper is copied as it is published in " The Political Beginnings."
</p>
<p>298 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>clear that it is, in fact, the very " copy of WHkinson^s re-
</p>
<p>port " which the editor of the Western World had informa-
</p>
<p>tion had been " transmitted to Dorchester."
</p>
<p>There is not an idea advanced, and scarcely an expres-
</p>
<p>sion nsed, in these " Reflexions of a Gentleman of Ken-
</p>
<p>tncky " of which the reader can not iind the counterpart,
</p>
<p>or one closely resembling it, m Wilkinson's letters to
</p>
<p>Miro to be found in Ga.yarre, and republished from that
</p>
<p>author in Smith's History of Kentucky. The arguments
</p>
<p>used in the letters of Wilkinson to the Spaniard are pre-
</p>
<p>cisely identical with those employed by the " Gentleman
</p>
<p>of Kentucky " to operate upon the Briton. But two in-
</p>
<p>stances of this identity of argument, of thought, and even
</p>
<p>of language and illustration will suffice : In the " Retiex-
</p>
<p>ions " occurs this sentence : "As the balance inclines the
</p>
<p>beam, the Atlantic States of America must sink as the
</p>
<p>western settlements rise." In Wilkinson's letter to Miro,
</p>
<p>of February 12, 1789, the same idea is presented thus:
</p>
<p>" It is not to be presumed that the eastern states, which at
</p>
<p>present have the balance of power in their favor in the
</p>
<p>American government, will consent to strip themselves of
</p>
<p>this advantage, and increase the lueight of the southern states
</p>
<p>by acknowledging the independence of this district and
</p>
<p>admitting it to be a member of the Federal Union." In
</p>
<p>the "Reflexions" the gentleman of Kentucky says:
</p>
<p>" That power which commands the navigation of the Missis-
</p>
<p>sippi as completely commands the whole country traversed by its
</p>
<p>waters as the key does the lock, the citadel the outworks."
</p>
<p>And Wilkinson, in his letter to Miro, thus paraphrases
</p>
<p>the idea, which undoubtedly was his own : " For, whatever
</p>
<p>power shall command that navigation wWl control all the coun-
</p>
<p>try which is watered by that river and by those streams that
</p>
<p>fall into it. This control will be as eflective and complete as
</p>
<p>that of the key upon the lock, or that of the citadel over

</p>
<p>the exterior works which it commands.'" The intelligent
</p>
<p>reader will come to the conclusion that, as Dorchester's
</p>
<p>dispatch clearly points to some member of the party
</p>
<p>which, as he stated, had proposed in the November con-
</p>
<p>vention to throw themselves under the protection of Spain,
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy.  299
</p>
<p>and had afterwards, as the " result of more prioafe councils,"
</p>
<p>conchided to look to Great Britain instead, as having fav-
</p>
<p>ored him with these " Reflexions,"  so the identity of the
</p>
<p>sentiments, words and illustrations in those " Reflexions "
</p>
<p>with those of Wilkinson's letter to Miro, prove that arch
</p>
<p>traitor to have been the author of both.
</p>
<p>The reader will not need to be reminded, that in the
</p>
<p>name of John Connolly the patent to a large body of land
</p>
<p>covering a great portion of the site of the present city of
</p>
<p>Louisville, had leen issued in 1773, and that it was confis-
</p>
<p>cated as the property of a Tory. Professing to have discov-
</p>
<p>ered some legal flaw in the proceedings which had stripped
</p>
<p>him of his jtossessions, and to have come for the purpose
</p>
<p>of having those proceedings set aside Jind liis lands re-
</p>
<p>stored to him, Dr. Connolly visited Kentucky in the fall
</p>
<p>of 1788. While the motives assigned may not have been
</p>
<p>entirely deceitful, it seems certain that the most impor-
</p>
<p>tant, if not the only real, business he had in Kentucky
</p>
<p>was to watch the course of the Spanish intrigue, which
</p>
<p>was known to have been in progress, and, if practicable,
</p>
<p>to create a diversion in favor of King George. lie came
</p>
<p>from Detroit to the Big Miami, followed that stream to
</p>
<p>its mouth, and thence proceeded to Louisville, whore his
</p>
<p>friend and former partner in the owtiership of the land
</p>
<p>at the Falls, Colonel John Campbell, lived. From the let-
</p>
<p>ter of General Wilkinson to Miro, of February 12, 1789,
</p>
<p>it is ascertained that Connolly " arrived in Louisville in
</p>
<p>the beginning of October," * 1788, and with this state-
</p>
<p>ment information derived from other sources fully corre-
</p>
<p>sponds. There, if Wilkinson's account be true, he remained
</p>
<p>during the canvass preceding the election of delegates to
</p>
<p>the l^rovend)er convention of that year, and <lnring the
</p>
<p>sitting of that convention, securing full information of all
</p>
<p>that transpired, and having ample opportunity of consult-

</p>
<p>ing and communicating with many of the prominent and
</p>
<p>influential men of the district. Wilkinson received "im-
</p>
<p>mediate information " from Dunn of Connolly's presence
</p>
<p>Gayarrc, page 2;>5.
</p>
<p>300 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>at Louisville, "and of the intention which Connolly had
</p>
<p>to visit him" (me), for the purpose of detachino^ him from
</p>
<p>the interest of Spain, and of bribing him to enter into the
</p>
<p>designs of the British ; and Wilkinson invited Connolly to
</p>
<p>visit him in Lexington. " Consequently," says Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>" he came to my house on the Sth of November," 1788. As
</p>
<p>the letter is printed in Gayarre, the Sth of November is
</p>
<p>stated by Wilkinson as the date of Connolly's arrival at
</p>
<p>his house; but this is clearly a misprint or else a slip of
</p>
<p>Wilkinson's pen for the ISth of November; because the
</p>
<p>official report of the November convention shows that on
</p>
<p>the 8th of November Wilkinson was in Danville, and was
</p>
<p>not at his home in Lexington. He did not leave Danville
</p>
<p>until after the adjournment of the convention late on the
</p>
<p>10th of November. That the 18th was intended is the
</p>
<p>more certain from Wilkinson's further statement in the
</p>
<p>same letter, that, after having "pumped" Connolly, he
</p>
<p>succeeded in terrifying him by employing a hunter to
</p>
<p>make a pretended attempt upon his life, which alarmed
</p>
<p>Connolly "so much, that he begged me to give him an
</p>
<p>escort to conduct him out of our territory, which I readily
</p>
<p>consented to, and on the 20th of November, he recrossed
</p>
<p>the Ohio on his way back to Detroit." The context of
</p>
<p>Wilkinson's letter represents that Connolly's departure
</p>
<p>very closely followed his arrival, probably on the very
</p>
<p>next morning, which, if it was the 19th, would have given
</p>
<p>time for him to have reached Maysville, the place where
</p>
<p>he crossed the Ohio on his return to Detroit, by the 20th
</p>
<p>of the month.*
</p>
<p>* It should be stated in this connection that a copy of a pass said to
</p>
<p>have been given by Connolly to a messenger whom he dispatched to
</p>
<p>Canada, which was alleged to have been dated at Lexington, December
</p>
<p>2, 1788, and was forwarded by Isaac Dunn to General St. Clair, conflicts
</p>
<p>with the statement of Wilkinson as to the time when Connolly left. Lex-

<p>ington. St. Clair's letters later still in December show that he supposed
</p>
<p>Connolly was yet in Lexington when those letters were written. This
</p>
<p>would confirm the statement made in the Western World in 1806, that
</p>
<p>Connolly remained in Lexington about three weeks. It is altogether
</p>
<p>probable that Wilkinson lied to Miro as to the expedition with which he
</p>
<p>got rid of Connolly, and if he lied about that, it could only have been
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 801
</p>
<p>It is known that Connolly paid a call at the residence of
</p>
<p>Colonel Thomas Marshall hefore visiting Wilkinson, and
</p>
<p>that he went from the house of the former to that of the
</p>
<p>latter.
</p>
<p>After describing the contents of Brown's letter to Muter
</p>
<p>and of Wilkinson's Memorial, and relating the conduct of
</p>
<p>both in the November convention, in his letter to Wash-
</p>
<p>ington, Colonel Marshall wrote that ''about this time" arrived
</p>
<p>from Canada the famous Dr. Connolly ; " his ostensible
</p>
<p>business was to inquire after and repossess himself of,
</p>
<p>some lands he formerly held at the Falls of the Ohio ; but
</p>
<p>I believe his real business was to sound the disposition of
</p>
<p>the leading men of this district respecting this Spanish
</p>
<p>business. Me knew that both Colonel Muter and myself had
</p>
<p>given it all the opposition in convention we were able to do, and
</p>
<p>before he left the district, ^^azW us a visit, though neither of as
</p>
<p>had the honor of the least acquaintance with him." It is
</p>
<p>made certain by this statement of Colonel Marshall that
</p>
<p>the visit of Connolly to Muter and himself was after the
</p>
<p>convention, in which Connolly " knew" that these two men
</p>
<p>liad given the " Spanish business" " all the opposition tliey
</p>
<p>were able to do ; " and that it was made after Connolly had
</p>
<p>been in Kentucky for some time and was about to leave
</p>
<p>the district. The letter of Wilkinson to Miro, and that
</p>
<p>of Colonel Marshall to Washington, were written on the
</p>
<p>same day, give the same account of the conduct of Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson, Brown and their party, and agree as to the time
</p>
<p>when Connolly's visit was made to them. Connolly was
</p>
<p>accompanied to Colonel Marshall's by his former partner,
</p>
<p>Colonel John Campbell, who introduced bin), and stated
</p>
<p>the object of his visit, and who, if not actually favorable
</p>
<p>to Connolly's designs, had certainly been communicated
</p>
<p>with and was cognizant thereof. As stated to Colonel
</p>
<p>Marshall by Connolly, the schemes were that, if the Ken-

<p>tuckians were disposed to assert their rights to the naviga-

<p>with Britain. That he was the " Kentucky Gentleman " who wrote the

</p>
<p>tion of the Mississippi, Great Britain would furnish them
</p>
<p>with arms, ammunition, clothing and money and aid them
</p>
<p>with four thousand troops from Canada, besides the two
</p>
<p>regiments then in Detroit;  with which assistance it was
</p>
<p>calculated that the Kentuckiana could seize upon New
</p>
<p>Orleans, fortify the Balize, and maintain themselves
</p>
<p>against Spain, It appears that no condition was annexed
</p>
<p>by Connolly, that this aid would be made contingant upon
</p>
<p>a separation from the Union by Kentucky ; but it was
</p>
<p>plain to Colonel Marshall that this was implied. " It ap-
</p>
<p>})ears plain to me," he wrote to Washington, "that the
</p>
<p>offers of Lord Dorchester, as well as those of Spain, are
</p>
<p>f(inidod on the supposition that it is a fact that we are
</p>
<p>about to separate from the Union ; else, why are those
</p>
<p>oUbrs uot made to Congress?"
</p>
<p>The professions of Connolly, a desire to serve the
</p>
<p>district, were so earnest, that, as he wrote to Washington,
</p>
<p>Colonel Marshall might have confided to him his appre-
</p>
<p>hensions from the machinations of Spain ; but from this
</p>
<p>he was withheld by his knowledge of the Tory's character
</p>
<p>as a perfidious intriguer. lie responded to Connolly's
</p>
<p>protestations of the friendliness of Lord Dorchester to the
</p>
<p>Kentuckians by sarcastically reminding him of the con-
</p>
<p>duct of Great Britain during the revolution; indicating
</p>
<p>the opinion that, at that very time, the Indians were being
</p>
<p>stimulated in their attacks upon Keutuckians by the
</p>
<p>British; and that so long as the savages who perpetrated
</p>
<p>"such horrid cruelties upon our defenseless frontiers"
</p>
<p>" were received as friends and allies by the British at De-
</p>
<p>troit, it would be impossible" for Kentuckians to "be con-
</p>
<p>vinced of the sincerity of Lord Dorchester's ofters, let his
</p>
<p>professions be ever so strong." He concluded by telling
</p>
<p>Connolly that those professions of friendship would come
</p>
<p>with better grace after Lord Dorchester had " shown his

</p>
<p>disapprobation of the ravages of the Indians." Connolly
</p>
<p>disclaimed all responsibility on the part of the British for
</p>
<p>those outrages; but promised that on his return he would
</p>
<p>repeat to Dorchester arguments he had already made as to
</p>
<p>the necessity of interfering to prevent them, and in this

</p>
<p>he hoped to succeed. On taking his leave after this dis-
</p>
<p>couraging conversation, he politely requested that Muter
</p>
<p>and Marshall would correspond with him, and this they
</p>
<p>both consented to do if he would commence the corres-
</p>
<p>pondence and provide a means of carrying it o!i. There
</p>
<p>was not one word w4iich fell from the lips of Muter or
</p>
<p>Marshall to encourage a hope on the part of Connolly that
</p>
<p>either could ever be made an accessory to any scheme for
</p>
<p>separating Kentucky from the Union, or to one for assail-
</p>
<p>ing the provinces of Spain while the United States were
</p>
<p>at peace with that nation. All his professions of friend-
</p>
<p>ship and jjroffers of assistance were treated by them as
</p>
<p>insincere and deceitful. The reception he met with was so
</p>
<p>repellant, that neither ever saw or heard from him after-
</p>
<p>wards. The correspondence was never commenced.
</p>
<p>Colonel John Mason Brown had already placed Muter
</p>
<p>and Marshall in the July convention, of which neither was
</p>
<p>a member, in order to have tliem vote for Caleb Vv^al-
</p>
<p>lace's and the recommendatory resolutions, wliich votes
</p>
<p>they never gave, and to which resolutions their entire
</p>
<p>course proved that both were hostile. To make it ap])ear
</p>
<p>that they gave those alleged votes, which they never cast,
</p>
<p>while both were fully aware of the overture of Gardoqui
</p>
<p>and of what Brown expected to accomplish, and Caleb
</p>
<p>Wallace and Wilkinson tried to effect, by an illegal sepa-
</p>
<p>ration from Virginia and an assumption of independence
</p>
<p>and sovereignty, Colonel Brown made Muter receive
</p>
<p>Brown's letter and communicate its contents to Marshall
</p>
<p>and Edwards, before or during the July convention ; while
</p>
<p>Muter, in a published letter, had stated that it was not
</p>
<p>received until the following fall. Then, to give color to
</p>
<p>his insinuation that they were influenced by Connolly to
</p>
<p>change their position, and to oppose the efforts of John
</p>
<p>Brown, (which he pretended to be for the immediate ad-

<p>mission of Kentucky into the Union), in order to favor
</p>
<p>the designs of the British agent, he represented the visit
</p>
<p>of Connolly to have been made to Colonel Marshall in Octo-
</p>
<p>ber, 1788, before Muter's address of the 15th of that month
</p>
<p>had been issued. But Colonel Brown, when he made this
</p>
<p>304 The Spanish Consjpiraxty.
</p>
<p>statement, had read, and could scarcely have forgotten,
</p>
<p>the letter of Wilkinson to Miro, as well as that of Mar-
</p>
<p>shall to Washington, both written on the same day,
</p>
<p>while the time of the visit and the conversations were
</p>
<p>fresh in the minds of both. He knew from those letters
</p>
<p>that the visits of Connolly to Colonel Marshall and to
</p>
<p>Wilkinson were made in November^ 1788, after the con-
</p>
<p>vention of that month ; and that prior to those visits he
</p>
<p>had passed some time in Louisville. The historian, Mar-
</p>
<p>shall, (page 346), Butler, (page 183), and every other per-
</p>
<p>son who ever wrote upon the subject, informed him that
</p>
<p>the visit was made in Noveniber.'^
</p>
<p>Yet, while stating that "Colonel John Connolly made
</p>
<p>his way from Detroit to Kentucky, where he arrived in
</p>
<p>the beginning of October,"! Colonel Brown purposely
</p>
<p>omitted to mention his visit to ;uid sojourn in Lo'uisville.
</p>
<p>He then suppressed what Wilkinson and Marshall both
</p>
<p>wrote of the time at which Connolly's visits were made
</p>
<p>to them, which shows that it was in November, and after
</p>
<p>the convention ; and says, that " Wilkinson imagined that
</p>
<p>the purpose of the visit (to Kentucky) was to win over
</p>
<p>himself, and met Connolly with a show of friendliness that
</p>
<p>drew from him an avowal of the British plan;"  thus
</p>
<p>striving to produce the impression, that the meeting be-
</p>
<p>tween Connolly and Wilkinson was upon the "arrival" of
</p>
<p>the former in Kentucky, " in the beginning of October,"
</p>

<p>on the part of Britain.
</p>
<p>In a note at the bottom of page 184 of " The Political
</p>
<p>Beginnings " its distinguished author says : " The fo7'mer
</p>
<p>acquaintance of Connolly and Thomas Marshall, and the
</p>
<p>circumstances of the visit of the former to Marshall's
</p>
<p>home in (what is now) Woodford County, aj^e detailed by
</p>
<p>A. K. Marshall (son of Thomas) in the Western World
</p>
<p>newspaper for 25th of October, 1806, in one of the innu-
</p>
<p>merable articles filled with charge and countercharge that
</p>
<p>were then so fashionable in political controversy. From
</p>
<p>this statement it is clear that Connolly made to Thomas
</p>
<p>Marshall, in October, 1788, direct overtures for a severance
</p>
<p>from the Union and a state organization under British
</p>
<p>protection." Colonel Brown had, with the purpose for
</p>
<p>which his book was written, the strongest possible motive
</p>
<p>for not quoting the communication from A. K. Marshall to
</p>
<p>which his note referred. That motive is explained by the
</p>
<p>fact, that neither the communication in question, nor any
</p>
<p>other from A. K. Marshall, nor any from an^^ other mem-
</p>
<p>ber of that family, contains a solitary word from Avhich the
</p>
<p>wildest imagination could find the slightest foundation for
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown's statement, either that a former acquaint-

<p>the contrary, it distinctly appears from that communica-
</p>
<p>tion that the visit of Connolly was not made until after
</p>
<p>Marshall, was copied by the writer, and is now laid before the reader,
</p>
<p>viz :
</p>
<p>' " But that I see it, I should scarcely believe this fact would be urged
</p>
<p>as a stigma on my father. It is true that Colonel Connolly did call at
</p>
<p>Buck Pond ; it is also true he made overtures, tending to the separation
</p>
<p>of Kentucky from the United States, and used many arguments to in-
</p>
<p>duce my father to think the measure, and the possession of the Missis-
</p>
<p>sippi through British influence, would redound to the advantage of the
</p>
<p>District ; it is equally true that these overtures Avere repelled and that
</p>
<p>my father immediately communicated with General Washington on the
</p>
<p>subject ; and it is also true that the copy of this communication, and
</p>
<p>General Washington's answer, are not so far from Frankfort as the city
</p>
<p>of Richmond, and if any of the papers on this subject are in the hands
</p>
<p>of the Chief Justice, he acquired them with the other papers of Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Washington, and for a purpose too well known to need remark.
</p>
<p>These papers were never kei)t secret, they were shown to many, but as
</p>
<p>the interest in them had been lost, they were deposited with other old
</p>
<p>letters, and perhaps would never again have been noticed, but for the
</p>
<p>publications which have called them into view. They shall now be
</p>
<p>given to the world, and except those letters which will be extorted from
</p>
<p>me by Franklin, the editors of the W^estern World never did derive
</p>
<p>any information from me, (for I possessed none) or from my father's
</p>
<p>bureau, or as I believe from any member of my family. Yet the
</p>
<p>above declaration is not to be understood as extending to occasional re-
</p>
<p>marks published in that paper, for I believe several pieces have flowed
</p>
<p>from the pen of some of my family, who are willing to avow them.

<p>[This qualification had reference to communications over the signature
</p>
<p>of " Observer," which wer,e known to have been written by Humphrey

<p>" In the midst of sensations like these, the best and most virtuous of

<p>the human soul, the project of dismemberment rose like a cloud, to
</p>
<p>blot the felicities of his declining days. He opjjosed the project, and,
</p>
<p>aided by a majority of the citizens of Kentucky, he opposed it with success.
</p>
<p>While the irritations of that contest were still fresh in his mind, and the lacer-
</p>
<p>ations of opposition were scarcely healed, Connolly called, and opened to his
</p>
<p>view neAV scenes of turbulence and disquiet.
</p>
<p>"How far the arts of Colonel Connolly might influence the discon-
</p>
<p>tented and inflammatory spirits then in Kentucky it was not for my
</p>
<p>father to decide ; but devoted to the independence of America in all its

</p>
<p>Colonel Marshall had successfully ojyposed the project of dis-
</p>
<p>memberment, which was disclosed and was so successfully op-
</p>
<p>posed in the November convention ; and that the visit was
</p>
<p>made while the irritation of that contest was still fresh in
</p>
<p>Colonel Marshall's mind. As A. K. Marshall, in this very
</p>
<p>communication, promised to give to the public the letter
</p>
<p>of his father, and did accompany the communication by a
</p>
<p><;opy of that letter, which made the same statement, there
</p>
<p>was nothing therein from which the inference stated by
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown could possibly have been drawn.
</p>
<p>And so far from "detailing the former acquaintance of
</p>
<p>Connolly and- Thomas Marshall," the communication
</p>
<p>made no mention of such an acquaintance ; for there was
</p>
<p>none ; and the fact that there was none was stated by
</p>
<p>Colonel Marshall himself in the very letter which was fur-
</p>
<p>nished to the public with that communication ; and which
</p>
<p>statement Colonel Brown suppressed. In a later communi-
</p>
<p>cation, published December 4, 1806, A. K. Marshall stated,
</p>
<p>as one of the proofs that the family of Colonel Marshall
</p>
<p>had not given to the Western WorlA the information upon
</p>
<p>which its editorials were based, the fact, that, in one of those
</p>
<p>editorials published in the previous June or July, a previous
</p>
<p>acquaintance between Connolly and Colonel Marshall had
</p>
<p>been asserted, which the family all knew to be untrue
</p>
<p>from Colonel Marshall's own letter. * The inevitable in-
</p>
<p>informed the head of the government he adored, of the machinations
</p>
<p>of her foes not ... to abuse the presidential ear, by inspiring unworthy
</p>
<p>suspicions of any man  not as a smiling pick thank, or a base news-
</p>
<p>monger, but as a man whose services entitled his representations to re-
</p>
<p>spect, and whose personal intimacy commanded the executive confi-
</p>
<p>dence."
</p>
<p>No one can read the above and draw from it any other inference than
</p>
<p>that the visit of Connolly was made after Colonel Marshall had success-

<p>fully opposed the project of dismemberment, xvMch xcas in the November con-
</p>
<p>vention. The fact that but a single copy of the paper referred to by him
</p>
<p>as containing this communication is in existence, made Colonel Brown
</p>
<p>.suppose himself secure from detection.
</p>
<p>*The following is the statement of A. K. Marshall referred to, viz:
</p>
<p>" The letters which were promised have been furnished, and the time
</p>
<p>when, and the reasons why they were furnished was explained in one
</p>
<p>of my last. If we had shown those letters, as the man supposes, before

<p>felicity which marks all of Colonel Brown's performances
</p>
<p>in the " Political Beginnings" is in nothing made more
</p>
<p>conspiciions than in his attempt, by this gross misstate-
</p>
<p>ment of Alexander K. Marshall's communication, to slur
</p>
<p>the dead father by misrepresenting the testimony of the
</p>
<p>dead son. It is wonderful to see what a superstructure
</p>
<p>the talented author reared upon the foundation he laid in
</p>
<p>his unfounded statement that, as members of the July con-
</p>
<p>vention, Muter and Marshall had voted for the Wallace
</p>
<p>and the recommendatory resolutions. Like the Arabian
</p>
<p>impostor, he seems to have determined to storm the un-
</p>
<p>derstandings of his readers by the boldness of his leading
</p>
<p>fictions ; so that when once the gates of suspicion against
</p>
<p>Marshall were forced open, entrance for all future fallacies
</p>
<p>and misstatements would be made secure.
</p>
<p>That Colonel Brown understood the statements of Col-
</p>
<p>onel Marshall and Wilkinson as to the time when Con-
</p>
<p>nolly's visit was made, and that he comprehended how
</p>
<p>completely they refuted his own, is made plain by their
</p>
<p>careful exclusion from his " Political Beginnings." Col-
</p>
<p>onel Brown says, that " it is not to be asserted that Mar-
</p>
<p>shall agreed " to the alleged overtures of Connolly, and
</p>
<p>that " every presumption is to the contrary." But had he
</p>
<p>not taken such extraordinary pains to conceal from his
</p>
<p>readers what Colonel Marshall had actually said to Con-
</p>
<p>noil}^, as detailed in the letter to Washington, he would
</p>
<p>have saved himself the trouble of this misleading ad-
</p>
<p>mission ; that Marshall did not " agree " would not have
</p>
<p>been left to a mere " presumption ; " but his readers would
</p>
<p>have been furnished with conclusive evidence that Mar-
</p>
<p>shall treated the professions of friendship to Kentucky
</p>
<p>and the proffers made by Connolly vvnth the contempt they
</p>
<p>merited.

<p>plan which appears in all Colonel Brown's suppressions,
</p>
<p>nor the deliberate purpose which is apparent in all his in-
</p>
<p>accuracies ; and he has detected the motive of the talented
</p>
<p>author for concealing the proof that Connolly's visit was
</p>
<p>made in I^ovember, and for incorrectly asserting that it
</p>
<p>was made in October and before Muter's address was
</p>
<p>issued ;  that it was to lay the basis of his insinuation that
</p>
<p>the resistance offered by Marshall and Muter to the
</p>
<p>schemes of Wilkinson and Brown was prompted by Con-
</p>
<p>nolly. His attention is now drawn to an additional object
</p>
<p>of all this suppression of facts, of these misstatements of
</p>
<p>the evidence, and of these pamfully manufactured inac-
</p>
<p>curacies. On page 202 of his peculiar book, Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown reveals himself and his purpose still more clearly.
</p>
<p>Alluding to the adjournment of the November convention,
</p>
<p>he there says :
</p>
<p>" The parting of its members was not the kindly one of the preceding
</p>
<p>July. Angry taunts of inconsistency had been made against Judge
</p>
<p>Muter and Colonel Marshall. In turn they branded those who differed
</p>
<p>from them as traitors. The visit of Connolly to Marshall was suggested to he
</p>
<p>a British intrigue, and with equal heat the conversation of Brown with Gardo-
</p>
<p>qui was declared to he a Spanish conspiracy. ' Colonel Marslmll went so far as
</p>
<p>to write to Washington {12th Fehruary, 1789), detailing what had occurred in
</p>
<p>the convention, and giving his version of what Brown had there said.'^
</p>
<p>That is, that Colonel Marshall's charges against Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son and Brown were simply recriminatory, in retort for
</p>
<p>accusations they had preferred against him ; and that it
</p>
<p>was under the influence of the irritation of the crimina-
</p>
<p>tion of himself that Colonel Marshall wrote his letter to
</p>
<p>Washington ! It was to prepare the way for this manu-
</p>
<p>factured scene  for these pretended " taunts of inconsis-
</p>
<p>tency "  for this grand climax  that Colonel Brown made
</p>
<p>Muter and Marshall members of the July convention, of

<p>which he was informed by two letters of Muter that he
</p>
<p>was not a member, and by Humphrey Marshall that neither
</p>
<p>Muter nor Marshall was a member ; and that he forced
</p>
<p>them to vote for the resolution of Wilkinson and Wallace,
</p>
<p>in spite not only of this proof that neither was a member
</p>
<p>of that convention, but of Greenup's deposition, which he
</p>
<p>had read, that he had heard both declare their hostility to
</p>
<p>310 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>that resolution. It was to lay the foundation for his state-
</p>
<p>ment that Colonel Marshall's charcres against Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>Brown and their faction, at the adjournment of the No-
</p>
<p>vember convention, was simply in retaliation for the " sug-
</p>
<p>gestion that the visit of Connolly" to himself "was a
</p>
<p>British intrigue," that the talented author of the " Politi-
</p>
<p>cal Beginnings " resorted to the hold devices of affirming
</p>
<p>that visit to have been in October, and of giving the com-
</p>
<p>munication of A. K. Marshall, as published in a paper of
</p>
<p>which there is but one copy in the world, as his authority
</p>
<p>for that statement ;  when he knew positively, that it ap-
</p>
<p>peared as distinctly from the communication of the latter,
</p>
<p>that the visit was not made until after the adjournment of
</p>
<p>the November convention, as the same fact appeared in
</p>
<p>the letters of both Wilkinson and Marshall, which he sup-
</p>
<p>presses, and in all the written histories referring to the
</p>
<p>subject. The scene described by Colonel Brown never
</p>
<p>occurred. It is purely a creation by the talented author.
</p>
<p>Neither Muter nor Marshall had ever seen Connolly until
</p>
<p>a few days after the adjournment, and no suggestion could
</p>
<p>possibly have been made at that time, that a visit which
</p>
<p>had not been made Avas a British intrigue. Not one of
</p>
<p>these men ever made such a suggestion to Colonel Mar-
</p>
<p>shall as that ascribed to them by Colonel Brown. It is
</p>
<p>true, however, that " alienations there took j^l^ce, for
</p>
<p>which time offered no change, nor reflection any relaxa-
</p>
<p>tion." Colonel Marshall made to the faces of these men
</p>
<p>in plain terms the charges which he but guardedly con-
</p>
<p>veyed to General Washington. He was at no pains to
</p>
<p>hide the indignation which flashed from his eye nor the
</p>
<p>bitter scorn which curled his lip; that they hated him
</p>
<p>because they knew he understood them, is true, and that
</p>
<p>Brown, at least, transmitted his rancor is evident from the

<p>vindictive aspersions heaped upon Marshall in the "Begin-
</p>
<p>nings."
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown is at special pains to impress upon his
</p>
<p>readers the fact, that Colonel Marshall did not write to
</p>
<p>Washington the details of Connolly's visit until the 12th
</p>
<p>of February, 1789, and clearly implies that the delay was

</p>
<p>with an object. He deemed it unnecessary to suggest,
</p>
<p>that there were no mail facilities, and that no chance oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity of forwarding a communication might have earlier
</p>
<p>presented itself. IsTor does it seem to have occurred to the
</p>
<p>ingenuous author, that the letter was written immediately
</p>
<p>after the popular elections were held which called Wash-
</p>
<p>ington to the Presidency, three weeks before the Electoral
</p>
<p>Colleges had voted, and two months before his inauguration;
</p>
<p> until which event there was no practical object to be ac-
</p>
<p>complished by placing Washington in possession of the
</p>
<p>information, as, prior to his induction into the Presidency,
</p>
<p>he was charged with no duty and possessed no power in
</p>
<p>relation to the subject of the communication. Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown thinks it a matter of importance that Hary Innes
</p>
<p>wrote to Washington of Connolly's visit to Kentucky as
</p>
<p>early as the 18th of December, 1788 ; and contrasts his
</p>
<p>promptitude with the delay of Colonel Marshall ; and, on
</p>
<p>page 211, he intimates that in that letter Innes charged
</p>
<p>Colonel Marshall with being implicated in an intrigue
</p>
<p>with Connolly.
</p>
<p>The reader who has the interest to turn to Sparks, Vol.
</p>
<p>IX., page 474, will see that no reference Avhatever to Colo-
</p>
<p>nel Marshall was made by Innes in that letter, which did
</p>
<p>not apply to Marshall any more than it did to Innes'
</p>
<p>friend. General Charles Scott, who was also visited and
</p>
<p>conferred with by Connolly.
</p>
<p>But there was a marked contrast between the conduct
</p>
<p>of Marshall and Innes, which Colonel Brown must have
</p>
<p>noted, but upon which he did not deem it expedient to
</p>
<p>dwell : While Marshall stated to Washington not only the
</p>
<p>machinations of the Spaniards, as evidenced by the memo-
</p>
<p>rial of Wilkinson, the letters of Brown, and the speeches
</p>
<p>and conduct of both, but also and as fully the details of

<p>Connolly's remarks to Muter and himself, as equally show-
</p>
<p>ing the critical condition of affairs in the district, when
</p>
<p>both Spaniard and Briton assumed, as a foregone conclu-
</p>
<p>sion, that Kentucky was on the point of separating from
</p>
<p>the Union ;  Innes, who, since the previous February, had
</p>
<p>known from Wilkinson all about his engagement with
</p>
<p>312 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Miro, who was informed of Gardoqui's proposition to
</p>
<p>John Brown, who had heard Wilkinson's memorial read
</p>
<p>and listened to John Brown's speech in the ]^ovember
</p>
<p>convention, and who had, in the Jnly, as well as in the
</p>
<p>November convention, co-operated with them in their ef-
</p>
<p>forts to precipitate the district into the initial step of the
</p>
<p>programme;  Innes wrote to Washington of the " ablior-
</p>
<p>ence and detestation" he had "for a British connexion,"
</p>
<p>and that the conduct of Connolly had " alarmed his fears,"
</p>
<p>but did not write one word of the Spanish machinations
</p>
<p>with his friends, Wilkinson and Brown ! To the unbiased
</p>
<p>reader, however, this marked contrast in the conduct of
</p>
<p>the two men, one of whom had nothing, and the other
</p>
<p>much, to conceal, will appear vastly more significant than
</p>
<p>that one wrote in December, 1788, and the other in Feb-
</p>
<p>ruary, 1789.
</p>
<p>It suited the purpose of Colonel Brown to ignore all the
</p>
<p>abundant evidence, that for years there had been British
</p>
<p>emissaries in Kentucky, and that a disposition had existed
</p>
<p>on the part of some to seek a British alliance ; to refer to
</p>
<p>the effect of Connolly's visit exclusively as turning " a few
</p>
<p>minds to the contemplation of an English protectorate ;"
</p>
<p>and then to endeavor to make it appear, that one of those
</p>
<p>minds was that of Colonel Marshall, and, as the reader
</p>
<p>has seen, to covertly attribute to that influence the resist-
</p>
<p>ance made by Colonel Marshall to the schemes of Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son and Brown. Pursuing this line of insinuation the tal-
</p>
<p>ented author fishes from the Canadian archives the dis-
</p>
<p>patch of Dorchester and the " Reflexions of a Gentleman
</p>
<p>from Kentucky," which appear on a previous page, and

<p>thor, stated by, the editor of the Western World in 1806,
</p>
<p>enters into a labored argument to show that it had
</p>
<p>emanated from Colonel Marshall. True, Colonel Brown
</p>
<p>had, on page 184, stated that "it is not to be asserted that
</p>
<p>Marshall 'agreed' to Connolly's proposition; every pre-
</p>
<p>siunption is to the contrary. Nothing in his history war-
</p>
<p>llie Spanish Conspiracy. 313
</p>
<p>rants a suspicion of his devotion to American nationality."
</p>
<p>But, to so remarkable an author, neither his own state-
</p>
<p>ment, nor the unquestionable fact that was thus affirmed,
</p>
<p>interposed the slightest obstacle to the insinuation and
</p>
<p>argument he proceeds to make on page 188, that, not
</p>
<p>only had Colonel Marshall "agreed" with Connolly, but
</p>
<p>that he had actually written a solicitation to the British
</p>
<p>Government to extend her protection over Kentucky, and
</p>
<p>to " form contidential connexions with men of enterprise,
</p>
<p>capacity and popular influence resident on the western
</p>
<p>waters ;"  (that is, in plain terms, to bribe him, as Miro
</p>
<p>bribed John Brown's friends, Wilkinson and Sebastian,
</p>
<p>and, perhaps, others of the conspirators) ;  which is unlike
</p>
<p>any thing which ever proceeded from the pen or mouth of
</p>
<p>Colonel Marshall, but finds its counterpart in the boasts, in
</p>
<p>the hints and in the importunities which Wilkinson wrote
</p>
<p>to the Intendant.* It is immaterial whether, by a critical
</p>
<p>examination of Dorchester's language. Colonel Brown had
</p>
<p>discerned that the men to whose ^'^ more private councils"
</p>
<p>Dorchester referred, were " those " who had in the late con-
</p>
<p>vention proposed " to throw themselves under the protec-
</p>
<p>tion " of Spain, and that the paper he sets such store by
</p>
<p>was " their Reflexions," and not those of any of the devoted
</p>
<p>friends of the Union. Nor is it important whether, by a
</p>
<p>comparison of the language and ideas of the " Reflex-
</p>
<p>ions " with those of "Wilkinson's letters to Miro, he had
</p>
<p>detected the author of both in his grandfather's friend and
</p>
<p>leader. It is of some consequence, however, that his own
</p>
<p>conviction that Colonel Marshall was not one of the men
</p>
<p>included in those " more private councils," nor the author
</p>
<p>of the base paper he attributes to him, is plainly demon-
</p>
<p>strated by the remarkable care Colonel Brown took to

<p>of the indulgence shown by Gardoqui in his efforts to promote emi-
</p>
<p>gration to, and settlement in, Louisiana, viz.: " He gives passports to
</p>
<p>everybody, and instead of forming connections vdth men of influence in this
</p>
<p>district, who should be interested in favoring his designs, he negotiates with
</p>
<p>individuals who live in the Atlantic States, who, therefore, have no
</p>
<p>knowledge of this section of the countrv, and have no interest in it."

</p>
<p>he treated the Tory's communications.
</p>
<p>Following the line of misrepresentation which he had
</p>
<p>systematized. Colonel Brown says : " It is well established
</p>
<p>that Connolly conferred with no more than four men of
</p>
<p>importance in Kentucky, General James Wilkinson, Gen-
</p>
<p>eral Charles Scott, Colonel Thomas Marshall and Judge
</p>
<p>George Muter. The mind naturally turns to one of them
</p>
<p>as the author" of the paper which no one who was not
</p>
<p>thoroughly and infamously a traitor at lieart could or
</p>
<p>would have written. Scott is then dismissed from consid-
</p>
<p>eration because of his literary incapacity. Ilife grand-
</p>
<p>father's friend, "Wilkinson, is then eliminated, as if an
</p>
<p>algebraic zero, on the ground of the dissimilarity between
</p>
<p>his style and that of the " Reflexions,"  of the sufficiency of
</p>
<p>which the reader, who has noted the identity between the
</p>
<p>ideas and expressions in the " Reflexions" and those used
</p>
<p>by Wilkinson, can judge. 'And for the further reason that
</p>
<p>Wilkinson was already committed to Spain;  the force

</p>
<p>eral, and at the same time receiving a pension from Spain
</p>
<p>for his services in attempting to dismember the Union, 
</p>
<p>can estimate at its proper value. Having thus disposed of

<p>Scott and Wilkinson, the talented author continues :

<p>is assumed to have been written, and either delivered or
</p>
<p>forwarded to Connolly, by Colonel Marshall;  who, to
</p>
<p>have become the author of the paper thus wantonly and
</p>
<p>maliciously attributed to him, would have found it neces-
</p>
<p>sary to have suddenly transformed his own nature from

<p>that of the loyal, patriotic soldier, and the bold, frank

</p>
<p>man he had been for nearly three score years, to that of a
</p>
<p>sly knave and a sneaking traitor, whose heart was false and
</p>
<p>whose pen dripped lies. For there can be no question but
</p>
<p>that, if the same man who wrote the letter addressed by
</p>
<p>Colonel Marshall to Washington also wu^ote that paper,
</p>
<p>then that man added the meanness of a base liar to the
</p>
<p>guilt of a secret conspirator.
</p>
<p>If it be charitably assumed that Colonel Brown was
</p>
<p>really ignorant that the " Reflexions " were written by
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, as all the evidence combines to prove  never-
</p>
<p>theless it is true, that if he had published the statement of
</p>
<p>that conspirator, that Connolly had arrived in Louisville
</p>
<p>in the beginning of October, had remained there for six
</p>
<p>weeks before going to Fayette, and thus had ample oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity for conferring with many of the prominent men of
</p>
<p>the district, and that his visit to W^ilkinson was made in
</p>
<p>November,  it would have disproved his own statement,
</p>
<p>that it is clearly established that Connolly conferred with
</p>
<p>only the four men whom he named, and would have over-
</p>
<p>thrown the entire structure which he erected out of mate-
</p>
<p>rials of his own manufacture. The statement of Colonel
</p>
<p>Marshall, which he suppressed, that Connolly was intro-
</p>
<p>duced to Muter and himself by Colonel John Campbell,
</p>
<p>who privately stated the purpose of his visit, and that
</p>
<p>Connolly kneiv the part which Muter and himself had
</p>
<p>taken in the convention of November in defeating the " Span-
</p>
<p>ish business," would have confirmed Wilkinson and have
</p>
<p>added to his own discomfiture. It was for that reason
</p>
<p>they were siqjpressed and the communication of A. K,
</p>
<p>Marshall was misrepresented and falsified. That Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown's imputation upon Colonel Marshall is made hypo-
</p>
<p>thetically renders it the more unworthy. His very ad-
</p>
<p>mission that there is no ^^ positive proof" that either Muter

</p>
<p>or Marshall wrote the treasonable paper distinctly implies
</p>
<p>that there is proof, though not positive, that one or the
</p>
<p>other was its author. To make this injustice appear to be
</p>
<p>true, he garbled, suppressed, and perverted the evidence,
</p>
<p>and misrepresented and misstated all the facts, in a man-
</p>
<p>ner to which no man who believed his own cause to be
</p>
<p>316 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>just could ever resort. A man ignorant that Wilkinson
</p>
<p>was the author, and yet who had an honest purpose to
</p>
<p>make known the truth, would have deemed it a simple
</p>
<p>duty to declare, that there is no shadow of evidence that
</p>
<p>either Muter or Marshall had degraded himself by con-
</p>
<p>duct as infamous as that which they had both recently de-
</p>
<p>nounced and thwarted in Wilkinson and Brown.
</p>
<p>If the writer has wearied the patience of the reader by
</p>
<p>dwelling on this subject, it is because it seemed necessary
</p>
<p>to complete the exposure of the methods employed in the
</p>
<p>" Political Beginnings." The reputation of Colonel Mar-
</p>
<p>shall needs no vindication against the attempt of Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown to shift upon him this treasonable bantling of his
</p>
<p>ancestor's bosom friend. The letter to Washington speaks
</p>
<p>for itself. If there were no proof that the traitor Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son was the author of the " Reflexions," the record of
</p>
<p>Colonel Marshall's private and public life, his every utter-
</p>
<p>ance, his patriotic services, as valuable as they are well
</p>
<p>known, unite in loudly proclaiming and ineffaceably
</p>
<p>branding for what it is this gratuitous and characteristic
</p>
<p>aspersion upon his loyalty and truth.
</p>
<p>As the enraptured eye of the wearied traveler in the
</p>
<p>Sahara rests with delight upon the distant palm trees
</p>
<p>which shade the sparkling spring of sweet and living
</p>
<p>water, that gushes out from amidst the sands of the desert ;
</p>
<p> so will the reader who has wandered through this be-
</p>
<p>wildering maze of suppression, evasion and invented inac-
</p>
<p>curacy which appear in the "Political Beginnings," be
</p>
<p>charmed to find in all its pages a solitary truth. The
</p>
<p>plaintive statement, that while " Thomas Marshall did hint
</p>
<p>suspicions of Brown," yet " Brown never allowed himself
</p>
<p>to question the patriotism of Thomas Marshall," is exactly
</p>
<p>correct. And the reader will conclude that each had an

<p>equally sufficient reason for his course. Thomas Marshall
</p>
<p>hinted suspicions of Brown because he knew from Brown's
</p>
<p>own letters and words that those suspicions were well
</p>
<p>founded. And Brown did not permit himself to question
</p>
<p>the patriotism of Thomas Marshall, not simply because he
</p>
<p>knew that it would have been unjust, but because he was

<p>conscious that every one else would have known that it

<p>was false.*

<p>* Thomas Marshall, the oldest sou of John ]Marshall and Ehzabeth
</p>
<p>Markham, was born in Westmoreland county, Va., April 2, 1730. His
</p>
<p>first military service was as a "trooper" from Prince William, in the
</p>
<p>Braddock campaign. From 1759 to the breaking out of hostilities with
</p>
<p>Great Britain, he frequently represented Fauquier in the House of Bur-
</p>
<p>gesses, and was three times appointed, with Washington, Fielding,
</p>
<p>Lewis, William Green, and others, to settle the claims of soldiers in the
</p>
<p>French and Indian war. He was a member of the Virginia Convention
</p>
<p>of 1775, but left his seat to assist in organizing the "Culpepper Minute
</p>
<p>Men," of which regiment he was major, and won distinction at the battle
</p>
<p>of the Great Bridge. He was also a member uf the Convention of 1776,
</p>
<p>and was on the committee which drew up the ordinance for organizing
</p>
<p>the military forces of the state ; but he left his seat in that body also to
</p>
<p>take the place of major of the Third Virginia Infantry, Continental
</p>
<p>Line. He was soon placed in command of the regiment, which per-
</p>
<p>formed severe duty in the year 1776. The next year he won particular
</p>
<p>distinction at Germantown and at Brandy wine, where more than one-half
</p>
<p>of his officers and one-third of his men were killed and wounded. He
</p>
<p>was transferred to the colonelcy of the First Artillery, Virginia State
</p>
<p>Line, in 1778, and commanded that regiment until the expiration of its
</p>
<p>term of service, in 1781. Three of his sons all who were old enough 
</p>
<p>were officers in the Revolution John at 19, Thomas at 16, and James M.
</p>
<p>at 15 years of age. His kindred and his wife's kindred, in every direc-

<p>In compliance with the request preferred in the Address
</p>
<p>finally adopted by the November convention, the Virginia
</p>
<p>Assembly manifested the hearty good will of the mother
</p>
<p>state and her sincere desire to further the wishes and pro-
</p>
<p>mote the welfare of her children in the distant district, by
</p>
<p>passing a new act of separation. But, like those which
</p>
<p>preceded it, this act provided that the separation should
</p>
<p>not take place unless Congress should previously concur
</p>
<p>and provide for the admission of Kentucky as a state into
</p>
<p>the Union simultaneously therewith. The elections for
</p>
<p>members of another convention were held in April, 1789,
</p>
<p>and were unmarked by disturbance; for Wilkinson and
</p>
<p>Brown were not candidates. Muter and Marshall were

<p>again chosen from Fayette. On the 20th of July of the

<p>that the conditions specified by the new act were materially
</p>
<p>difi'erent from those which had formerly been agreed to,
</p>
<p>and that the change would be seriously detrimental to the
</p>
<p>interests of the proposed Commonwealth. The most ob-

</p>
<p>jectionable feature in the new proposition was that which
</p>
<p>reserved to claimants holding Virginia land warrants an
</p>
<p>unlimited time for location and survey. Therefore, instead
</p>
<p>of proceeding thereunder, the convention addressed the
</p>
<p>assembly in a respectful request to rescind the objection-
</p>
<p>able conditions and that others be adopted conforming to
</p>
<p>those to which mutual agreement had already been given.
</p>
<p>This also was immediately done by the assembly; but still
</p>
<p>another convention was required, and further postpone-
</p>
<p>ment was unavoidable. The elections for the convention
</p>
<p>thus ordered were held in May, 1790 ; the convention was
</p>
<p>convened at Danville on the 26th of July, 1790, and George
</p>
<p>Muter was chosen president thereof; the terms of the last
</p>
<p>act of separation were formally accepted; the address to
</p>
<p>the assembly announcing this acceptance was prepared
</p>
<p>and reported by the able and popular Alexander S. Bullitt ;
</p>
<p>and a memorial to the President and Congress, presented
</p>
<p>to the convention by James Markham Marshall,* was

<p>* James Markham, third son of Colonel Thomas Marshall, was born in
</p>
<p>1764, and, until he was fifteen years old, was educated at his father's
</p>
<p>home by Scotch tutors. He then entered the First Virginia Artillery,
</p>
<p>State Line, commanded by his father, as a cadet, and remained in it
</p>
<p>until its term of service had expired, when he had reached the rank of
</p>
<p>Captain. The statement of Mr. Paxton that he served to the close of
</p>
<p>the war as a Lieutenant in the regiment of Alexander Hamilton is an
</p>
<p>error; and if, as is not probable, he "led the forlorn hope at the siege
</p>
<p>of Yorktown, in an attack upon the fort," it was as a volunteer, for he
</p>
<p>was never a member of any other regiment than the Artillery. He did
</p>
<p>not remain long in Kentucky. In 1793, he was a resident of Philadel-
</p>
<p>phia. In that city he married, in 1795, Hester, the daughter of Robert
</p>
<p>Morris, the patriotic financier of the Revolution, and went with her to
</p>
<p>Europe as the agent of the merchants of Charleston, Baltimore and New
</p>
<p>York. The statement of Mr. Paxton that he negotiated the release of

</p>
<p>Lafayette from his imprisonment at Olmutz is also a mistake. The
</p>
<p>credit of that negotiation is due chiefly, if not altogether, to the distin-
</p>
<p>guished Gouverneur Morris. It is true, however, that Marshall was ap-
</p>
<p>pointed by Washington on a special and secret mission to the King of
</p>
<p>Prussia to secure the release of Lafayette from imprisonment at Ber-
</p>
<p>lin. But before he reached that city the gallant Frenchman had been
</p>
<p>released by the King; so that he had no participation in the matter.
</p>
<p>While in England, he purchased from the heirs of Lord Fairfax, in his
</p>
<p>own name, and in those of his elder brother, .lohn Marshall, of Raleigh

<p>adopted. It expressed " attachment to the present happy
</p>
<p>establishment of the Federal Constitution and Government,
</p>
<p>stated the causes and motives for separating from Virginia,
</p>
<p>the ability of Kentucky to sustain a separate state govern-
</p>
<p>ment, and the time to which its organization was limited,
</p>
<p>and praying Congress and the President to sanction the
</p>
<p>their entire inheritance in the "Northern Neck;" which gave them,
</p>
<p>after compromise with Virginia, 180,000 in the Leed's Parish. James il.
</p>
<p>Marshall bought General Lee's interest, and thus became the owner of
</p>
<p>half of the purchase. He was one of the "Midnight Judges " appointed
</p>
<p>by Adamis, and had the reputation of abilities equal to those of the
</p>
<p>Chief Justice.
</p>
<p>The oldest son of James M. Marshall Thomas  married Catharine
</p>
<p>Thornton, a granddaughter of Judge Innes. His other sons were the
</p>
<p>late Robert Morris Marshall, of Happy Creek ; Lieutenant John Mar-
</p>
<p>shall, of the Navy; the present Dr. Henry Marshall; and the eminent
</p>
<p>lawyer, the late James Marshall, of Winchester. The last named was a
</p>
<p>Union member of the Virginia convention of 1861. The only daughter
</p>
<p>of James M. Marshall, Susan, is the widow of the late Dr. Cary Ambler,
</p>
<p>of Fauquier. " Keith," a correspondent of the Commercial Gazette, of
</p>
<p>Cincinnati, after mentioning the records of numerous descendants of
</p>
<p>James M. Marshall, as soldiers in the Confederate army, wrote :
</p>
<p>" But braver far than any of these, more heroic than any paladin who
</p>
<p>ever led in headlong charge, or grimly brought up the rear guard in
</p>
<p>stubborn retreat, was that other grandson, the modest and gentle Dr.
</p>
<p>James Markham Marshall Ambler, who, upon the frozen banks of the
</p>
<p>Lena, in far away Siberia, laid down a young life marked by every high
</p>
<p>quality that could grace a gentleman. Graduating in medicine at the
</p>
<p>University of Maryland in 1869, he entered the Navy as a surgeon in
</p>
<p>1874. Though engaged to be married, the request telegraphed by the
</p>
<p>Department, that he would volunteer for duty on the ill-fated Jeannette,
</p>
<p>was one a soul like his could not decline. It is known that he might
</p>
<p>have saved his own life by leaving his comrades in the venture, but pre-

<p>ferred to die with them  a true soldier of duty, at his post. On a tablet
</p>
<p>in the Leeds Church, which commemorates his virtues, his fellow-sur-
</p>
<p>geons of the Navy recorded, that 'his sense of duty was stronger than
</p>
<p>his love of life;' and on a similar tablet, his former friends and class-
</p>
<p>mates at the Washington and Lee LTni versify, bore testimony that 'he
</p>
<p>declined the last chance of life that he might help his comrades. His
</p>
<p>last written words were the confident expression of his Christian faith.
</p>
<p>To him duty was the noblest word in the English language.' 'Greater

<p>whole proceedings, by passing an act of admission for the
</p>
<p>' State of Kentucky ' into the Union, agreeable to the time
</p>
<p>prescribed by Virginia in her act for that purpose." Pro-
</p>
<p>vision was made for the election of a ninth convention, to
</p>
<p>assemble in April, 1792, to form a State Constitution. In
</p>
<p>December, 1790, the admission of Kentucky into the Union
</p>
<p>was strongly recommended by Washington in a message
</p>
<p>to Congress, and the necessary act for that purpose was
</p>
<p>accordingly passed on the 4th of February, 1791. The
</p>
<p>ninth and last convention was chosen and assembled at
</p>
<p>the designated times, the first constitution was formed,
</p>
<p>which the people ratified in May, when ofiicers were
</p>
<p>elected, and the new Commonwealth, after so many trials
</p>
<p>in which the patriotism of the masses of the people had
</p>
<p>been tested and proven, was at length fairly launched.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, a few weeks after the November con-
</p>
<p>vention, of 1788, a petition was forwarded to Gardoqui by
</p>
<p>leaders of the Spanish party in Kentucky, sojiciting the
</p>
<p>grant of a large body of land in the Louisiana territory,
</p>
<p>on the Yazoo and Mississippi rivers, which Wilkinson de-
</p>
<p>scribed as " the most advantageous site to form a settle-
</p>
<p>ment above Natchez."* This petition was forwarded to
</p>
<p>Gardoqui by Major Isaac Dunn, the confidential agent and
</p>
<p>partner of Wilkinson, who wrote to Miro : " That peti-
</p>
<p>tion is signed by Innes, Sebastian, Dunn, Brown, and my-
</p>
<p>self,"  par nohile fratrum. This petition of the associates
</p>
<p>was accompanied by the letter from Wilkinson to Gardo-
</p>
<p>qui, which has been already quoted. f In it he explained,
</p>
<p>that the proposition suggested was in the interest of the
</p>
<p>plans which had been arranged with Miro, and for de-
</p>
<p>tails it referred him to Dunn. In his letter to Miro, of
</p>
<p>February 12, 1789, Wilkinson informed the Intendant of
</p>
<p>his application to the minister, and explained that " The

</p>
<p>resentment of Congress."* The whole scope and every
</p>
<p>line of the correspondence attests that the entire purpose
</p>
<p>of this and all other projects for colonizing Louisiana by
</p>
<p>emigration from Kentucky and the West and South, were
</p>
<p>in distinct compliance with the advice of Navarro, thus
</p>
<p>to build up a bulwark against the growing power of the
</p>
<p>United States ; and, how^ever ill digested, delusive and fu-
</p>
<p>tile they may now seem, were parts of the general scheme
</p>
<p>for separating Kentucky from the Union.
</p>
<p>That in this and in all other similar projects, of which
</p>
<p>there were many at the time, Wilkinson acted in the in-
</p>
<p>terest and as the agent of Spain, is shown by the reply of
</p>
<p>Miro to Wilkinson's letter communicating his petition to
</p>
<p>Gardoqui. The service to be rendered to the king by
</p>
<p>promoting the immigration to Louisiana of persons who
</p>
<p>needed only lands and not money, was favorably men-
</p>
<p>tioned. " It is proper," Miro continued, " that yon
</p>
<p>should remain in that district, in order to insist on an al-
</p>
<p>liance with Spain until it be effected or given up ; because,
</p>
<p>according to the answer received from the Court, you are now
</p>
<p>our agent, and lam instructed to give you to hope that the king
</p>
<p>will reward your services as I have already intimated to you.^'
</p>
<p>And in his dispatch to the Court of Madrid, Miro recom-
</p>
<p>mended that 5,000, which Wilkinson claimed to have ex-
</p>
<p>pended in the interest of Spain, should be refunded to
</p>
<p>him, and that he should be further entrusted with 2,500,
</p>
<p>which he had asked for, to corrupt Muter and Marshall. f

<p>In a note at the bottom of page 172, of the " Beginnings,"
</p>
<p>reference is made to a conversation alleged to have taken
</p>
<p>place between Gardoqui and John Brown in June, 1789,
</p>
<p>relating to this very petition of which he wrote to Miro
</p>
<p>and which John Brown had, conjointly with his friends,

<p>veyed to Gardoqui, as though it had been a proposition
</p>
<p>then for the first time made by Brown alone, and as if its
</p>
<p>sole object was to secure the navigation of the Mississippi

<p>for Kentucky. Thus : " Still bent upon pushing every
</p>
<p>practical expedient for securing the navigation of the Mis-*
</p>
<p>sissippi, Brown opened the subject by adverting to Mor-
</p>
<p>gan's jSTew Madrid colony, established the year before, and
</p>
<p>offered to find the capital for establishing, at the mouth of
</p>
<p>the Big Black river, one hundred American families
</p>
<p>within eighteen months." . . . The letters of Miro
</p>
<p>and Wilkinson, published in Gayarre, with which Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown was familiar, throw a vastly different light upon
</p>
<p>this project from that sought to be cast by the " Begin-
</p>
<p>nings ;" they disclose the real object of the scheme ; and
</p>
<p>they were, on that account, discreetly skipped over by
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown, while the names of his grandfather's asso-
</p>
<p>ciates in the enterprise, which of themselves suggest much
</p>
<p>as to its nature, were, for the same reason, most prudently
</p>
<p>suppressed.
</p>
<p>The reader is informed of the affidavit made by Daniel
</p>
<p>Clark, jr., which was submitted to Congress in 1808; and
</p>
<p>of the methods used by Wilkinson to discredit the testi-
</p>
<p>mony of Clark and Power, given before the court-martial
</p>
<p>which was then ordered for the trial of Wilkinson, who
</p>
<p>had then attained the highest position in the army. He
</p>
<p>is also informed of the manner in which that discredited
</p>
<p>evidence was afterwards confirmed by the publication of
</p>
<p>the conspirator's own letters, obtained from the Spanish
</p>
<p>archives. Clark affirmed that, about the year 1789,"^ he
</p>
<p>had seen " a list of names of citizens of the western coun-
</p>
<p>try, which was in the hand-writing of the General, who
</p>
<p>were recommended for pensions, and the sums proper to
</p>
<p>be paid to each were stated ; and I then distinctly under-

<p>sion, at various times and through different persons,
</p>
<p>amounting in the aggregate to nearly $30,000. The re-
</p>
<p>ceipt of some of these remittances were denied by Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson in the subsequent military inquiry, and those
</p>
<p>which were proven so that they could not be denied he
</p>
<p>asserted had been paid for damaged tobacco, which had
</p>
<p>been condemned, but was afterwards received and paid
</p>
<p>for by the Spanish Government. As it was certain that
</p>
<p>he had made sales of tobacco to that government, his sub-
</p>
<p>ordinates in the army, with whom he was popular, were
</p>
<p>only too glad to avail themselves of the "presumption"
</p>
<p>thus created, to acquit him.
</p>
<p>In his Centennial Address, Colonel Brown, who was la-
</p>
<p>boring to show that the corruption of Wilkinson had
</p>
<p>commenced long after he had abdicated the leadership
</p>
<p>which John Brown and Innes recognized, accepted the
</p>
<p>version given by Wilkinson of the receipt of these various
</p>
<p>sums. He may never have read the interesting volume
</p>
<p>published by Dan. Clark in 1809, in which the false pre-
</p>
<p>tenses of Wilkinson were completely exploded. In that
</p>
<p>book it was shown that, in 1787, Wilkinson and Isaac B.
</p>
<p>Dunn were partners, and that Daniel Clark, Senior, the
</p>
<p>uncle of the witness, acted as their agent for the sales of
</p>
<p>their shipment of that year, which amounted in the aggre-
</p>
<p>gate to $10,805. Of this sum, $3,000 were due to Clark,
</p>
<p>being for money he had advanced to Wilkinson, on the
</p>
<p>recommendation of the Spanish officials, before he left
</p>
<p>New Orleans, Several of Wilkinson's bills or drafts in
</p>
<p>favor of different parties were accepted and paid ; $3,389
</p>
<p>was paid in cash to Dunn in July, 1788 ; and on the 8th
</p>
<p>of August, 1788, all the balance due was paid, and the
</p>
<p>account was receipted in full by Dunn and was closed.*

<p>1, 1789, when the partnership terminated, was $16,441.
</p>
<p>As before, a large part of this had been anticipated by
</p>
<p>Wilkinson. On May 1, 1789, a balance of $6,251 due Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson was paid upon his order to Captain Abner Dunn,
</p>
<p>(brother of Isaac B. Dunn,) who examined the account,
</p>
<p>certified to its correctness, and receipted for the money ;
</p>
<p>and thus also that account was settled and closed.* This
</p>
<p>account did not include |6,000 which Ballinger, one of
</p>
<p>Wilkinson's friends and agents, carried up and delivered
</p>
<p>to him in Frankfort, that same year ; and it results that
</p>
<p>that sum loas not paid to him on account of any coynmercial
</p>
<p>transactions with the Spanish gDvernment, from which Bal-
</p>
<p>linger received it. There was another transaction, how-
</p>
<p>ever, during the same year, prior to the dissolution of the
</p>
<p>partnership. Clark had sent up the river on the joint
</p>
<p>account, a boat called the Speedwell, with a cargo amount-
</p>
<p>ing to about $8,000, which was not included in this settle-
</p>
<p>ment. Wilkinson agreed to invest the proceeds of the
</p>
<p>cargo in good tobacco and ship it to New Orleans, and
</p>
<p>when this was done, the partnership was to cease. This
</p>
<p>shipment was to have been made in December, 1789, but
</p>
<p>was not made until June, 1790; and in the meantime,
</p>
<p>since the preceding May, no other shipment had been
</p>
<p>made. The accounts of the sales of the Speedwell's cargo,
</p>
<p>as well as of the tobacco, were kept by Philip ]!^olan,
</p>
<p>Wilkinson's protege. The tobacco was sold to the Span-
</p>
<p>ish government; the net sum realized was $15,850. This
</p>
<p>account was also closed September 21, 1790, the profits
</p>
<p>were divided, Wilkinson's porticfn was paid to and re-
</p>
<p>ceipted for by ]N"olan, who applied it to the payment of Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson's debts, which were as numerous as his creditors
</p>
<p>were clamorous. In the settlement an error of $473
</p>
<p>against Clark was discovered, which was certified to by

<p>from the Spanish government after he went into the army

<p>was due from any of his commercial transactions up to

<p>326 The Spamsli Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>September 1, itOO, is proved by these accounts. The next
</p>
<p>year Wilkinson formed a partnership with Peyton Short,*
</p>
<p>which, their ventures being unfortunate, completed the
</p>
<p>bankruptcy of Wilkinson's already desperate fortunes,
</p>
<p>while Short never recovered from the embarrassment en-
</p>
<p>tailed by his brief commercial connection with the most
</p>
<p>greedy and unscrupulous of adventurers. Neither the
</p>
<p>accounts of Short nor those of Dunn gave any clew to
</p>
<p>any debts in IS'ew Orleans remaining due to the firms in
</p>
<p>which they were associated with Wilkinson, nor to any
</p>
<p>tobacco they had in storage there or anywhere else,
</p>
<p>whether damaged or sound. With Wilkinson's appoint-
</p>
<p>ment to the army, in 1791, all his commercial ventures
</p>
<p>ceased. His claim, that the various sums paid to him by
</p>
<p>the Spanish government after that time, amounting to
</p>
<p>many thousands of dollars, were in payment of damaged
</p>
<p>tobacco shipped to New Orleans in 1789, and stored in
</p>
<p>that city since that time, was proved by the accounts of
</p>
<p>his several firms to have been a fraud as transparent and
</p>
<p>impudent as his treason was flagrant. The conclusion is
</p>
<p>irresistible, that, in fulfillment of the written promise given
</p>
<p>on the faith of the Spanish king, by Miro, in 1790, they
</p>
<p>were the reward of treason which commenced in 1787 ;
</p>
<p>that, having been already in the employ of Spain as the

<p>He married a daughter of Judge John Cleves Symmes  her sister was

<p>tune, and dying unmarried, he left his estate to his nephews, the late
</p>
<p>Judge William Short, of Cincinnati, and the late Dr. Charles W. Short,
</p>
<p>of Louisville. Wilkinson went into the army in debt to Peyton Short
</p>
<p>and to many others, availed himself of his official position to evade and
</p>
<p>delay payment, but was finally forced to a settlement with Short by the
</p>
<p>celebrated James Hughes, whom he had attempted to bully in 1788.

<p>agent of that power in its projects for the division of our
</p>
<p>country, the recommendations of Miro that he should be
</p>
<p>^^ retained" in that service on an " annual pension " were
</p>
<p>efiective, and that the payment of the pension was then
</p>
<p>commenced.
</p>
<p>Needing a trusty agent to go to i^ew Orleans to convey
</p>
<p>to him the wages of his infamy, Wilkinson, who was then
</p>
<p>in the army and stationed at Fort Washington, in 1794
</p>
<p>applied to his friend, Hary Innes, who had removed from
</p>
<p>Danville to Frankfort and was the Judge of the Federal
</p>
<p>court, to recommend to him a man adapted for the secret
</p>
<p>and perilous service. A neighbor of Innes, one Henry
</p>
<p>Owen, was chosen, who thereupon proceeded to New Or-
</p>
<p>leans, and there received from the Baron de Carondelet
</p>
<p>^6,000 to be conveyed to Wilkinson. With this sum in
</p>
<p>charge Owen was .sent by Carondelet to New Madrid,
</p>
<p>with a letter to Portell, the commandant. By Portell he
</p>
<p>was embarked on a galliot commanded by Francis Lang-
</p>
<p>lois, and was conveyed to the mouth of the Ohio, all the
</p>
<p>territory on both banks of which river was within the
</p>
<p>United States. There he was provided by Langlois with a
</p>
<p>boat's crew of six men and was shipped with Wilkinson's
</p>
<p>money on a pirouge or canoe. While ascending the Ohio,
</p>
<p>and when within the territory and jurisdiction of the
</p>
<p>United States, he was murdered and robbed by his crew,
</p>
<p>on the Ohio river, near its northern shore, And thus within
</p>
<p>the jurisdiction of the state and Federal courts of Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky. Three of the murderers were afterwards arrested
</p>
<p>in the neighborhood of Frankfort, and were brought be-
</p>
<p>fore the Federal Judge, Innes, the friend of their victim,
</p>
<p>who refused to try them. In his History, Humphrey Mar-
</p>
<p>shall states that the ground of this refusal was that the
</p>
<p>murderers were " Spanish subjects," which, as every intel-

<p>ligent reader will comprehend, was as insufficient as it was
</p>
<p>ridiculous. But he " quietly committed them to the cus-
</p>
<p>tody of his brother-in-law, Charles Smith, who, with a
</p>
<p>little guard hired by the Judge, was directed to deliver
</p>
<p>them to General Wilkinson at Fort Washington. Smith
</p>
<p>was ordered by Wilkinson to convey them to the Spanish
</p>
<p>328  The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>commandant at New Madrid, and in complying with his
</p>
<p>instructions attempted to pass the American Fort Massac
</p>
<p>in the night. But the officer commanding at that post
</p>
<p>had been directed by General Wayne to watch the suspi-
</p>
<p>cious intercourse between Wilkinson and the Spaniards,
</p>
<p>and stopped the boat. He did not clearly perceive why
</p>
<p>felons who had murdered and robbed an American citi-
</p>
<p>zen, within American territory, should be thus smuggled
</p>
<p>away from the jurisdiction of American courts. Instead
</p>
<p>of permitting Smith to pass with the murderers he sent to
</p>
<p>Portell at New Madrid for an interpreter to interrogate
</p>
<p>them. The Spaniards were most unwilling that, by an
</p>
<p>investigation in an American court, the facts of the com-
</p>
<p>munication between Carondelet and Wilkinson should
</p>
<p>be developed, the interpreter did not divulge the confes-
</p>
<p>sions made by the villains, all evidence as to their guilt was
</p>
<p>withheld, and they were finally discharged. Marshall dis-
</p>
<p>tinctly intimates that the motive of Innes and Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>in thus endeavoring to ship those murderers to the Span-
</p>
<p>ish authorities, was, not only that they might be put to
</p>
<p>death summarily, but, chiefly, in order to suppress the ex-
</p>
<p>posure that might be the result of a public trial by an
</p>
<p>American court. Whether or not his inference was just,
</p>
<p>the facts he stated are clearly established.
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown, alluding to Daniel Clark's deposition in
</p>
<p>1808, says, that the statement made by the witness that he
</p>
<p>had knowledge that Wilkinson was receiving a Spanish
</p>
<p>pension as early as 1793 or 1794 is clearly an error ; that
</p>
<p>Clark seems to have regarded the $6,000 sent from New
</p>
<p>Orleans in Owen's care, as a pension fund ; but that the
</p>
<p>accounts between Wilkinson and Miro show this sum to
</p>
<p>have been a remittance due Wilkinson on his tobacco
</p>
<p>venture.* The facts already stated disprove this asser-

<p>tion. It is worthy of note, too, that the money " sent
</p>
<p>from New Orleans in Owen's care" was so sent by the
</p>
<p>Baron de Carondelet, direct from the Spanish treasury,
</p>
<p>nearly three years after Miro had left New Orleans for

<p>Spain. The reader will observe that Colonel Brown refers
</p>
<p>to the sum of which Owen was robbed as if that was the
</p>
<p>only amount mentioned by Clark's deposition as received
</p>
<p>by Wilkinson in payment of his pension. Of course, Col-
</p>
<p>onel Brown had read the deposition which he cited. If
</p>
<p>this reasonable supposition is correct, he had read in that
</p>
<p>deposition Clark's statement of the sum conveyed by
</p>
<p>Joseph Collins by the sea to ^qw York, and thence to
</p>
<p>Wilkinson at Fort Washington, where it was paid to Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson in the presence of his friend, John Brown, in 1795.
</p>
<p>Wilkinson refused to give a receipt for the money, -telling
</p>
<p>Collins that Brown was a witness that it had been paid.
</p>
<p>He had read in that deposition the statement of the money
</p>
<p>conveyed to Wilkinson by Thomas Power and of various
</p>
<p>other sums which Wilkinson received direct from the
</p>
<p>Spanish government between 1793 and 1797. But to have
</p>
<p>mentioned them w^ould, to say the least, have cast doubt
</p>
<p>upon his claim that the pension did not commence until
</p>
<p>1797, and that the sum of which Owen was robbed was
</p>
<p>due to Wilkinson by the estate of Miro, on account of his
</p>
<p>tobacco venture. All mention of them was, therefore,
</p>
<p>omitted from the reminiscences that enliven the Address.
</p>
<p>Whether or not the inference of Humphrey Marshall as
</p>
<p>to the motive of Judge Innes and General Wilkinson in
</p>
<p>refusing to try and hurrying the murderers of Owen out
</p>
<p>of the reach of American courts, was just ;  it is certain
</p>
<p>that Colonel Brow^n was of the opinion, that, if the murder
</p>
<p>was committed wdthin American jurisdiction, there could
</p>
<p>have been no sufficient or honest motive for the course
</p>
<p>pursued by the Federal judge and the Federal general,
</p>
<p>those familiar friends and coadjutors of John Brown in
</p>
<p>the times of 1788. In his judgment, evidently, if the facts
</p>
<p>stated by Marshall were admitted, there was no escape

</p>
<p>from his inference ;  if the premises were conceded, the
</p>
<p>conclusion naturally followed. Still, the course of Innes
</p>
<p>and Wilkinson must be defended. The emergency was,
</p>
<p>therefore, surmounted and the difficulty overcome, by the
</p>
<p>cool assertion, that the murder was perpetrated within
</p>
<p>Spanish territory, and, hence, of course, neither Innes nor
</p>
<p>330 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>any other American judge had jurisdiction. True, every
</p>
<p>book that had ever referred to the subject had stated that
</p>
<p>the murder was perpetrated within American territory.
</p>
<p>And Colonel Brown had read in Governor Greenup's depo-
</p>
<p>sition that he had " heard that this man was murdered on
</p>
<p>the Ohio." Yet the necessity of extricating Judge Innes
</p>
<p>from that affair seemed to be urgent. And the author,
</p>
<p>who afterwards represented the communication of A. K.
</p>
<p>Marshal] in the Western World of October 25, 1806, (only
</p>
<p>one copy of which paper is in existence) to have detailed
</p>
<p>the previous acquaintance between Connolly and Colonel
</p>
<p>Marshall, and to have stated that Connolly's visit was made
</p>
<p>in October, in order to show that Colonel Marshall had been
</p>
<p>influenced and won over by the Tory's overture ;  this
</p>
<p>orator and author was not to be daunted by petty difficul-
</p>
<p>ties when an old friend needed assistance. So, the reader
</p>
<p>of his Address finds at the bottom of page 10, a note in
</p>
<p>which this appears, viz :
</p>
<p>" The murderers of Owen {he was murdered in Spanish territory) were
</p>
<p>brought to Frankfort and kept under guard in the house of Jeremiah
</p>
<p>Gullion, which stood where the Methodist Church is now built on
</p>
<p>Washington street. There Judge Innes and Buckner Thruston (after-
</p>
<p>wards Senator) examined them. They were forwarded to the military
</p>
<p>commandant (Wilkinson) at Fort Washington (or Cincinnati), there
</p>
<p>being no treaty of extradition, nor any judicial power to commit, try or
</p>
<p>surrender them for a crime committed in a foreign jurisdiction"
</p>
<p>In support of this cool assertion Colonel Brown referred
</p>
<p>to the deposition of Buckner Thruston in the case of
</p>
<p>Innes v. Marshall, the original of which had been taken
</p>
<p>away from the Clerk's office at Harrodsburg, and was
</p>
<p>safely hidden in a box at the Polytechnic Library in Louis-
</p>
<p>ville, there being but two copies thereof in existence, one
</p>
<p>of which Colonel Brown had before him as he wrote.

</p>
<p>Said Colonel Brown : " The action of Judge Innes and
</p>
<p>his explanation of lack of judicial power \q detailed by Buck-
</p>
<p>ner Thruston in his deposition." The reader will now be
</p>
<p>curious to ascertain what Thruston said on the subject.
</p>
<p>It is here produced, viz :
</p>
<p>" That, being at Frankfort in the State of Kentucky, in the month of
</p>
<p>December, 1794, (as well as he remembers) during the sitting of the
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 331
</p>
<p>Legislature, he understood that Governor Shelby had received a letter
</p>
<p>from the Spanish commandant at New Madrid, informing him of the
</p>
<p>murder of a certain Henry Owen, by some boatmen ivJio loere conducting
</p>
<p>the said Owemip the Ohio to Fort Washington, with a sum of money for
</p>
<p>General Wilkinson, and that the said boatmen had also robbed the said
</p>
<p>Owen and fled to Kentucky ; and requesting the governor, Shelby, to
</p>
<p>endeavor to have the said murderers apprehended ; that some days
</p>
<p>afterwards, three men who appeared to be Spaniards or Frenchmen,
</p>
<p>were brought to Frankfort aforesaid, supposed to be the same murderers
</p>
<p>mentioned in the said Spanish commandant's letter."
</p>
<p>Jii.dge Thruston continued : " It was generally under-
</p>
<p>stood (as this deponent verily believes) that the said mur-
</p>
<p>der had been perpetrated out of the State of Kentucky,
</p>
<p>viz : on the north-west side of the Ohio river, and (as this
</p>
<p>deponent thinks) it was so stated in the Spanish com-
</p>
<p>mandant's letter." Colonel Brown assuredly was not
</p>
<p>ignorant that the territory on both sides of the Ohio river
</p>
<p>was American, and had never been Spanish. The evidence
</p>
<p>of Thruston does not suggest, that there was the slightest
</p>
<p>doubt in his mind, that either the federal or the state
</p>
<p>courts of Kentucky had jurisdiction in this case ;  because,
</p>
<p>though he said the murder had been " committed out of
</p>
<p>the State of Kentucky," he immediately qualified that state-
</p>
<p>ment by the explanation, that what he meant was that it
</p>
<p>had been perpetrated " on the north-west side of the Ohio
</p>
<p>EiVER," which he knew, and which Colonel Brown very
</p>
<p>well knew, was within the jurisdiction of Kentucky, and of
</p>
<p>the federal district court therefor, which jurisdiction ex-
</p>
<p>tended then, as it does now, to low water mark on that side
</p>
<p>of the Ohio river. And, even had the state and federal
</p>
<p>courts of Kentucky possessed no jurisdiction of this of-
</p>
<p>fense, by reason of its having been perpetrated beyond
</p>
<p>that jurisdiction, in that case Judge Thruston knew, and

</p>
<p>Colonel Brown was fully aware, that the federal court for
</p>
<p>the territory of Illinois or that for Indiana, both of which
</p>
<p>were then in full operation, would have had plenary power
</p>
<p>in the premises ;  so that, if Innes had no power to try
</p>
<p>them, then the only proper and legal course to pursue was,
</p>
<p>to remand them until the proper measures could have
</p>
<p>been instituted for handing them over to the custody of
</p>
<p>332 The Si^anish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>those who had tlie power and were charged with the duty
</p>
<p>of trying and punishing their crime. Instead of which,
</p>
<p>the Federal Judge, with an expedition and vigor which sel-
</p>
<p>dom marked his movements, hurried them oif to his friend
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, who, in turn, made an effort to hurry them
</p>
<p>out of the reach of all American authorities. It is true,
</p>
<p>that Judge Thruston deposed as his belief, that Innes in
</p>
<p>thus acting had "acted as an individual^ and not in his
</p>
<p>official character as a judge; in which latter character, this
</p>
<p>deponent does not think the said Innes had competent au-
</p>
<p>thority to take such steps." But it is manifest to the reader,
</p>
<p>that, whether Innes acted as a judge, or as an individual,
</p>
<p>his taking possession of the murderers and hurrying them
</p>
<p>away, had the same effect to prevent an examination by
</p>
<p>an American court. It is true, also, that Thruston ex-
</p>
<p>pressed his belief that Innes was actuated by " virtuous
</p>
<p>motives," and that he " concurred" in Innes' course "as
</p>
<p>the most probable way of bringing them to justice; which
</p>
<p>it Avas believed they would certainly meet with if they
</p>
<p>could be returned into the .hands of the said Spanish com-
</p>
<p>mandant." But if the author of " The Political Begin-
</p>
<p>nings " had himself been satisfied with tliis reasoning, he
</p>
<p>would have published what Thruston really testified, and
</p>
<p>would not, in the face of Thruston's deposition, have as-
</p>
<p>serted that the murder was committed within Spanish
</p>
<p>territory, and as proof of that assertion have referred to a
</p>
<p>deposition which he supposed would never be examined,
</p>
<p>and which flatly contradicted his own statement.
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown's address refers to Clark's deposition
</p>
<p>taken by order of Congress. He may, however, never
</p>
<p>have read Clark's publication in 1809. Let it be assumed
</p>
<p>that, in his explorations, he never did. Keverthless, the

<p>of his Catholic Majesty, and commanded the gaUiot the Flecha, then

<p>Taureau and batteau the Prince of Asturias ; that whilst there a Mr.
</p>
<p>Owens arrived from New Orleans with a sum of money, entrusted to
</p>
<p>him by the Baron de Carondelet, to be delivered to General Wilkinson
</p>
<p>somewhere on the Ohio, and this deponent had direction from the said

<p>Baron de Carondelet to take measures, in concert with Don Thomas
</p>
<p>Portell, the commandant at New Madrid, and the aforesaid Owens, to
</p>
<p>have the sum entrusted to the charge of this latter conveyed in safety
</p>
<p>to its destination in consequence thereof this deponent, at a council
</p>
<p>held at New Madrid, by Portell, Owens and himself, recommended that
</p>
<p>resident citizens of that place should be employed to accompany Owens,
</p>
<p>but his opinion was overruled by Portell and Owens, who thought it
</p>
<p>would be more economical, and consequently more agreeable to the
</p>
<p>Spanish Government, to have a boat's crew furnished from the galliot
</p>
<p>of this deponent, which he furnished ; and further he deposes, that the
</p>
<p>sum of six thousand dollars, which had been brought by Owens from
</p>
<p>New Orleans to New Madrid, and by him delivered to Don Thomas
</p>
<p>Portell, the commandant of the fort, was by Portell embarked on board the
</p>
<p>galliot of this deponent, to be conveyed to the mouth of the Ohio, at which place
</p>
<p>he furnished Owens with a patron, named Pepello, and six of his oarsmen,
</p>
<p>and shipped in his canoe the before mentioned sum of six thousand dollars, to be
</p>
<p>delivered to General Wilkinson; and he declares that the sum was
</p>
<p>packed by himself in three small barrels, but being apprehensive of
</p>
<p>some bad design on the part of Owens' crew, he took back the money
</p>
<p>into his galliot, and retained it twenty-four hours in his possession,
</p>
<p>when, at Owens' pressing solicitations, he re-delivered it to him, who then

<p>rested, and sent to New Orleans for trial, one Vexerano, one of Owens'
</p>
<p>crew, who was concerned in the murder of said Owens and the plunder
</p>
<p>of the money. He further deposes, that, although it was agreed between
</p>
<p>the Spanish Government and Owens, to save appearances, that the money
</p>
<p>should appear to belong to said Owens, yet he knows it was sent by the Ba-
</p>
<p>ron de Carondelet, for the use of, and to be delivered to. General Wilkinson, and
</p>
<p>that knowing the interest which the Spanish Government had in this

<p>transaction, he wrote an ofticial account to the Baron de Carondelet of
</p>
<p>the part he had taken in it, and the advice he had given respecting the

<p>conveyance of the money safely to its destination, and in reply the Ba-

<p>statement that it was perpetrated in Spanish territory ; 
</p>
<p>which is without any authority whatever, and originated
</p>
<p>in what he apparently deemed the urgency of his case.
</p>
<p>How desperate that case seemed to him ; how inevita-
</p>
<p>ble the damaging inference of Marshall from the certain
</p>
<p>and proven facts appeared to the calm judgment and
</p>
<p>alert perception of the author of the Address, is made
</p>
<p>patent by the tremendous efforts put forth to avoid what
</p>
<p>impressed him as the justice of that conclusion.
</p>
<p>No difficulty daunts a man who is conscious of his own
</p>
<p>genius. In the "Political Beginnings" Colonel Brown
</p>
<p>obliterated space by making John Brown, (who was in
</p>
<p>Danville at the time,) " representing Kentucky in the Vir-
</p>
<p>ginia Senate," procure from that body the passage of the
</p>
<p>resolutions of 1786 relating to the Mississippi. In the

</p>
<p>me to engage in hin service and to abandon every other occupation, without
</p>
<p>the prospeet of remuneration ^
</p>
<p>This letter was immediately forwarded by Wilkinson to
</p>
<p>Miro, to whom he wrote on the 26th of January, 1790, re-
</p>
<p>ferring to the convention to meet in June of that year.
</p>
<p>" I will pay strict attention to its proceedings, and I will present my-
</p>
<p>self to that assembly, with the intention of doing all that may be in my
</p>
<p>power, to promote the interest of our cause, in which I shall be warmly
</p>
<p>assisted by our good friend, Sebastian, who is now my principal aid, because,
</p>
<p>although Harry Innes is also our friend, yet the office he holds renders it
</p>
<p>improper for him to work openly." 
</p>
<p>Miro forwarded the letters of Wilkinson and of Sebas-
</p>
<p>tian to Madrid, with the expression of the opinion that
</p>
<p>" said brigadier-general ought to be retained in the service
</p>
<p>of his majesty, ivith an annual pension of two thousand dol-
</p>
<p>lars, which I have already proposed in my confidential
</p>
<p>dispatch 'No. 46," and with the recommendation that a
</p>
<p>pension should also be granted to Sebastian, f Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown could scarcely have failed to read those letters in
</p>
<p>Gayarre. His statement that " it does not seem that they
</p>
<p>communicated " is about as true as his assertion that the
</p>
<p>evidence shows that they were the only conspirators ; and
</p>
<p>neither requires any comment.
</p>
<p>When Wilkinson's letter of January 26, 1790, was writ-
</p>
<p>ten, a marked change had taken place in the temper of

</p>
<p>wrote :
</p>
<p>" At present all our politicians seem to have fallen asleep. Buoyed
</p>
<p>up by the privilege of trade which has been granted to them on the
</p>
<p>Mississippi, the people think of nothing else than cultivating their lands
</p>
<p>and increasing their plantations. In such circumstances it is impossible
</p>
<p>that I should, with any chance of success press upon them the import-
</p>
<p>ant question which I had proposed to myself on my arrival here.
</p>
<p>" I am justified in saying that Congress strongly suspects my connec-
</p>
<p>tion with you, and that it spies my movements in this section of the
</p>
<p>country. Consequently an avowed intention on my part to induce
</p>
<p>these people here to separate from the Union, before the majority of
</p>
<p>them show a disposition to support me, would endanger my personal
</p>
<p>security, and would deprive me of the opportunity of serving you in
</p>
<p>these parts. My situation is mortally painful, because whilst I abhor
</p>
<p>all duplicity, I am obliged to dissemble. This makes me extremely de-
</p>
<p>sirous of resorting to some contrivance that will put me in a position in
</p>
<p>which I flatter myself to be able to profess myself publicly the vassal
</p>
<p>of his Catholic Majesty, and therefore to claim his protection, in what-
</p>
<p>ever public or private measures I may devise to promote the interest of
</p>
<p>the Crown." 
</p>
<p>The " privilege of trade " to which the conspirator re-
</p>
<p>ferred was one permitting the navigation of the Missis-
</p>
<p>sippi below onr boundaries and trade with Louisiana to all,
</p>
<p>on payment of an ad valorum duty of fifteen per cent.
</p>
<p>Against this, as well as against every relaxation of the
</p>
<p>most rigid occlusion of the Mississippi, to all save himself
</p>
<p>and confederates, the correspondence shows that Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son, from the beginning, vehemently protested, as a sur-
</p>
<p>rendering of the lever by which alone the Spaniards might
</p>
<p>force tbe separation of the west from the United States.
</p>
<p>And, beyond peradventure, the eifect of his arguments,

<p>was the most serious embarrassment experienced by Wash-
</p>
<p>ington in the negotiations he immediately inaugurated for
</p>
<p>securing to the west the rights so invaluable to her people.
</p>
<p>Those movements, and the hopes engendered by Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son's arguments, caused the Spaniards to delay for years
</p>
<p>their accession to the treaty which was concluded in 1795 ;
</p>
<p>and, but for the pressure and harassments entailed by the
</p>
<p>revolution in France, would have altogether defeated all
</p>
<p>of Washington's exertions in behalf of the people of the

<p>west, which were unremitting and most active at the
</p>
<p>very time he was most fiercely assailed by demagogues ;
</p>
<p>some of whom desired an alliance with Spain, while oth-
</p>
<p>ers sought to involve us in war in behalf of, and to make
</p>
<p>America subservient to, the Government of the Guillotine.
</p>
<p>It was in the same letter from which the above is quoted,
</p>
<p>that Wilkinson wrote of the appointment of Innes by
</p>
<p>Washington, construing it as one intended to secure the
</p>
<p>fidelity of his friend, in whose behalf he asserted a prefer-
</p>
<p>ence for a pension from New Orleans over one from New
</p>
<p>York. His own appointment he doubtless attributed to
</p>
<p>the same motive ;  the construction would have been the
</p>
<p>proper one.
</p>
<p>That Sebastian was pensioned by Spain was incontestibly
</p>
<p>established. The clear light cast upon the subject by the
</p>
<p>archives of that power ; his demand, so early as 1790, for
</p>
<p>compensation for his efibrts to separate Kentucky from
</p>
<p>the Union ; the recommendation of Miro then made that
</p>
<p>this request should be granted and Sebastian be regularly
</p>
<p>employed in the service of Spain,  create a presumption
</p>
<p>that can not be overcome by the statement of so utterly
</p>
<p>false a man to the contrary, that Miro's advice was
</p>
<p>heeded, and that the pension commenced when that advice
</p>
<p>was given in 1790. His actions then indicated to many
</p>
<p>that he was not only a secret agent of Spain, but that he
</p>
<p>was the dishonorable stipendiary of that power. As he
</p>
<p>was appointed a judge of the court of appeals by Shelby^
</p>
<p>in 1792, what was apparent to others could not have been
</p>
<p>credited by the rough fighting executive, who had flanked
</p>
<p>Cornstalk at Crooked Creek, and laid Ferguson low at
</p>
<p>King's Mountain. But, whatever the time when that
</p>
<p>pension commenced, and whatever the service for which
</p>
<p>it was paid, Sebastian, while a judge of the court of ap-

<p>peals, continued to receive it, until the fact was publicly
</p>
<p>exposed in 1806, when, pending an investigation by the
</p>
<p>legislature which looked to his impeachment, and in order
</p>
<p>to stop the inquiry, he resigned the office which he had
</p>
<p>disgraced.
</p>
<p>While never entirely abandoned, either from the expec-

</p>
<p>tation that he would soon be recalled to Spain, or from a
</p>
<p>doubt of their success, the intrigues of Miro to dismember
</p>
<p>the Union, manifestly slackened in 1791. The communi-
</p>
<p>cation with Wilkinson, who was occupied on the part of the
</p>
<p>Spaniards in various schemes of colonizing Louisiana, was
</p>
<p>steadily maintained. The commercial ventures of the lat-
</p>
<p>ter had met with their final shipwreck, and in the fall of
</p>
<p>the year named, he was appointed to a Lieutenant Colon-
</p>
<p>elcy in the army of the United States. On the 30th of
</p>
<p>December, Miro, after a successful and benign administra-
</p>
<p>tion, which had won the hearts of the Louisianians, and
</p>
<p>completely reconciled them to the Spanish domination,
</p>
<p>was succeeded as governor by the Baron de Caroudelet.
</p>
<p>He immediately sailed for Spain, where his brilliant mili-
</p>
<p>tary career won for him the baton of a Marescal de Cam.po,
</p>
<p>or Lieutenant General. His successor was a native of
</p>
<p>Flanders, but by acknowledged ability, activity and zeal,
</p>
<p>had risen to the rank of a Colonel in the royal army. His
</p>
<p>attention was at first occupied with the domestic compli-
</p>
<p>cations of his province, arising from the turbulence of
</p>
<p>Bowles and others, but he soon resumed the communica-
</p>
<p>tion with Wilkinson which had been interrupted by the
</p>
<p>departure of Miro.
</p>
<p>In the meantime the war of factions in the United States,
</p>
<p>the hostilities with the Indians, and foreign complications,
</p>
<p>rendered the condition of the country so extremely criti-
</p>
<p>cal, that Jefierson and Hamilton, who agreed in nothing
</p>
<p>else, were convinced that the firm hand of Washington
</p>
<p>alone could guide the ship of state and save it from wreck.
</p>
<p>Not only were the measures of his administration bitterly
</p>
<p>assailed, and his wise eftbrts to avoid entanglement with
</p>
<p>the wars by which Europe was convulsed, denounced as a
</p>
<p>manifestation of his purpose to establish a monarchy in

</p>
<p>vituperation, or, to use his own language, "in such exag-
</p>
<p>gerated and indecent terms, as could scarcely be applied to
</p>
<p>a Nero, to a notorious defaulter or even to a common pick-
</p>
<p>pocket." These assaults were made under the immediate
</p>
<p>patronage and auspices of the " Democratic societies "

</p>
<p>which were organized in diiFerent parts of the United
</p>
<p>States, and were modeled after the Jacobin Clubs of Paris,
</p>
<p>of which Robespierre was at once the type and the idol.
</p>
<p>While loudly clamoring against the government because
</p>
<p>the executive honestly maintained neutrality in the wars
</p>
<p>of Europe, these clubs denounced and every-where encour-
</p>
<p>aged resistance to the taxes which were indispensable to
</p>
<p>provide the means for maintaining public credit and to
</p>
<p>carry on the ordinary operations of government. The
</p>
<p>agents of the revolutionary government of France were
</p>
<p>engaged in an effort to separate the people of the United
</p>
<p>States from their own government, to incite them to open
</p>
<p>revolt against that government, and, in defiance of the
</p>
<p>proclamations of the President, to organize an army
</p>
<p>within the territory of the United States, to make war
</p>
<p>upon the Spanish in Louisiana, and to reduce that prov-
</p>
<p>ince once more to the French dominion. In all the insult-
</p>
<p>ing defiance with which these emissaries treated the au-
</p>
<p>thority and government of the United States, the}^ were
</p>
<p>openly encouraged and sustained by the Democratic so-
</p>
<p>cieties. Finally an insurrection against the government
</p>
<p>broke out in Pennsylvania, to resist the excise tax, in such
</p>
<p>formidable dimensions that an army under the command
</p>
<p>of General Lee was embodied and sent to quell the armed
</p>
<p>force which haql organized to overthrow the authority of

<p>law. "While there was no outbreak in Kentucky, much

<p>was done to inflame the people to a similar movement.

<p>Carondelet at once organized the military forces of
</p>
<p>Louisiana for defense, fortified J^ew Orleans and the other
</p>
<p>strong places on the Mississippi, and in all respects proved
</p>
<p>himself a man of sleepless vigilance and an executive of
</p>
<p>ability and energy. " ISTot trusting entirely to these means
</p>
<p>of defense, he had recourse to the politic arts of the diplo-
</p>
<p>matist, and in order to appease the hostility of the West-
</p>
<p>ern people, he removed some of the restrictions which
</p>
<p>cramped their trade, granted again important privileges
</p>
<p>to some enterprising and influential men among them, and
</p>
<p>prepared himself to renew Miro's former scheme of win-
</p>
<p>ning over that restless and energetic population to the
</p>
<p>dominion of Spain, The firm and loyal interference of
</p>
<p>Washington prevented the attack which was threatened
</p>
<p>from the Ohio districts, checked the intrigues of Genet,
</p>
<p>and relieved the apprehensions of the Spanish authorities
</p>
<p>in Louisiana." In the meantime, Washington also sent
</p>
<p>James Innes to Kentucky to explain to Governor Shelby
</p>
<p>that, while the details of his negotiations had not been
</p>
<p>publicly divulged, yet the situation of Kentucky had en-
</p>
<p>gaged his attention from the moment of his inauguration,
</p>
<p>his resolute determination never to sacrifice nor abandon
</p>
<p>her interests, the constant efforts he had made to secure to
</p>
<p>her people the enjoyment of their right to navigate the
</p>
<p>Mississippi, and his confident expectation that a treaty
</p>
<p>recognizing that right would soon be concluded. The
</p>
<p>reader has seen how these movements in the West, and
</p>
<p>the hopes Spain builded thereon, was the constant obstacle
</p>
<p>that impeded the accomplishment of the President's per-
</p>
<p>sistent efforts.

<p>the intrigues of Spain. The irritation in Kentucky and
</p>
<p>Tennessee against the Federal Government because it could
</p>
<p>not secure to them the navigation of the Mississippi, which
</p>
<p>Wilkinson had urged the Spaniards never to concede ; the
</p>
<p>whisky insurrection in Pennsylvania; the war with the
</p>
<p>Indians, all of whom were engaged in open hostilities ;
</p>
<p>the embarrassments of the negotiations with Great Britain,
</p>
<p>Spain and France ; and then the assaults of the Democratic

<p>societies and their press, exciting the people against their
</p>
<p>own government and undermining their confidence in the
</p>
<p>illustrious patriot who was at its head, all combined to
</p>
<p>render the situation precarious.
</p>
<p>The chief emissary chosen by Carondelet was Thomas
</p>
<p>Power, an Englishman by birth, but naturalized a Spanish
</p>
<p>subject,  a man at once intelligent, bold and cautious. As
</p>
<p>stated by Gayarre, he came to Kentucky " under the pre-
</p>
<p>tense of collecting materials for a natural history of that
</p>
<p>section of the country, but really to revive with Wilkinson^
</p>
<p>Innes, Sebastian and others, the plots which had been car-
</p>
<p>ried on under Miro's administration." Reports made by
</p>
<p>Power to Carondelet of the disposition towards the gen-
</p>
<p>eral government of a number of leading citizens of Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky, some of whom the latter knew to have formerly
</p>
<p>been engaged in a secret correspondence with Miro, in-
</p>
<p>duced in the Spanish governor the hope that he might
</p>
<p>now successfully renew the intrigues of his predecessor.
</p>
<p>Gayoso de Lemos, Governor of J^atchez, was chosen for
</p>
<p>the delicate mission, and Power was dispatched in the fall
</p>
<p>of 1795 to make the necessary arrangements with Sebas-
</p>
<p>tian, Innes, and others. He carried with him a letter from
</p>
<p>Carondelet to Sebastian, which he delivered to the latter.
</p>
<p>Sebastian undertook to confer with Innes, William
</p>
<p>Murray and George Nicholas, to whom he was requested

</p>
<p>by Carondelet to communicate the contents of his letter,
</p>
<p>and Power proceeded to Cincinnati to deliver to General
</p>
<p>Wilkinson a letter from Sebastian. This letter apprised
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, who was then Brigadier-General of the Amer-
</p>
<p>ican army, of the new eftbrts to carry out the old scheme
</p>
<p>in which both had been formerly engaged. According to
</p>
<p>344 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>the sworn statement of Power, Wilkinson then made
</p>
<p>known to him " the whole plot, which was a separation of
</p>
<p>the Western from the Eastern States, snch as was developed
</p>
<p>in Sebastian's trial." After a number of conferences with
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, in wliich the matter was discussed, PoAver re-
</p>
<p>turned to Red Banks, there met Sebastian, who had, in
</p>
<p>the meantime, consulted witli Innes, Murray, and Nich-
</p>
<p>olas, and had gone with their concurrence to meet Gayoso,
</p>
<p>in accordance with the request conveyed in the letter of
</p>
<p>Carondelet, and with him went to IvTew Madrid, where
</p>
<p>Gayoso awaited them.
</p>
<p>Eeyond peradventure this was, as stated by the histori-
</p>
<p>ans, Gayarre and Martin, by Clark and by Power, but a
</p>
<p>reopening of the plan of dismemberment which had been
</p>
<p>entered upon some years before by Miro and Ailkinson,
</p>
<p>and had been "discussed" between Gardoqui and John
</p>
<p>Brown. The grant of the navigation of the Mississippi
</p>
<p>was, as formerly, the inducement oft'ered by Spain, and
</p>
<p>the dismemberment of the United States was the object
</p>
<p>Spain sought to effect. The terms of Carondelet's letter
</p>
<p>to Sebastian are known only so far as the alleged copy
</p>
<p>thereof in the handwriting of Sebastian reveal them. The
</p>
<p>letter is here published as it aytpears in the deposition of
</p>
<p>Innes before the committee which investigated Sebastian

</p>
<p>I am, by information, well acquainted with the character of some of
</p>
<p>the most reputable inhabitants of Kentucky, particularly of Innes,
</p>
<p>Nicholas, and Murray, to whom, I wish you to communicate the pur-
</p>
<p>port of this address, and should you and these gentlemen, think the ob-
</p>
<p>ject of it as important as I do, you will doubtless accede, without hesi-
</p>
<p>tation, to the proposition I have made, of sending a delegation of your
</p>
<p>countrymen, sufficiently authorized to treat on a subject which so deeply
</p>
<p>involves the interest of both our countries.
</p>
<p>I remain, with every esteem and regard. Sir, your most obedient,
</p>
<p>humble servant,
</p>
<p>The Baron of Carondelet.
</p>
<p>The reader will not fail to note that no mention is made
</p>
<p>in this missive of the United States, nor is there any refer-
</p>
<p>ence in it to the people of the western country as a com-
</p>
<p>ponent part of the Union. It clearly relates to them as a
</p>
<p>people of a country distinct and separate from any other
</p>
<p> a people who had the power to negotiate treaties, which
</p>
<p>the Spaniard knew, as well as Innes and Sebastian knew
</p>
<p>it, that no state of the Union possessed. The letter did
</p>
<p>not invite those gentlemen to come to New Madrid to
</p>
<p>converse or confer with Gayoso in regard to the terms of
</p>
<p>concessions intended to be made to the people of the
</p>
<p>United States or of any part thereof; but to send persons
</p>
<p>duly authorized and empoivered by the people of the ivestern
</p>
<p>country, as a distinct country, to negotiate a treaty in which
</p>
<p>it was proposed to grant to the people of that country
</p>
<p>valuable privileges. A separation from the Union by the
</p>
<p>people to whom this grant was to have been made was
</p>
<p>plainly implied in every line of the communication. It
</p>
<p>was so understood by Carondelet and his agent, by Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson and Sebastian, according to Power's testimony,
</p>
<p>and by the historians who had access to the facts. The

<p>willing to " open that navigation to the people of the
</p>
<p>western country!" "Therefore," instead of concluding
</p>
<p>a treaty with the United States, which the government
</p>
<p>had urged ever since independence had been obtained,
</p>
<p>and which Spain had most obstinately refused to consider,
</p>
<p>unless the right to that navigation was abandoned ; 
</p>
<p>" therefore, I have made this communication to you"
</p>
<p>known to me, by your correspondence with Miro, to have
</p>
<p>been engaged with him in a plot to separate Kentucky
</p>
<p>from the Union, " in expectation that you will procure
</p>
<p>agents to be chosen and fully emjyowered by the people of
</p>
<p>your country to negotiate with Colonel Gayoso, at New
</p>
<p>Madrid!" To minds of ordinary sagacity it must liave
</p>
<p>been apparent at once, that this proposition, secretly made
</p>
<p>to individuals, that ^Ae peoT^^e of the country in which they
</p>
<p>lived should appoint agents to treat and negotiate with a
</p>
<p>foreign power, concerning the concession of privileges
</p>
<p>which that power had refused to grant to, or even to treat
</p>
<p>of with, the government to which they owed allegiance,
</p>
<p>must of necessity cover an ulterior, sinister and illicit de-
</p>
<p>sign, which no citizen, much less state and Federal judges,
</p>
<p>could consider without gross impropriety. That Sebastian
</p>
<p>well knew what that design was is certain. To Innes,
</p>
<p>who, in 1787, bad written to Governor Eandolph that in a
</p>
<p>few years Kentucky would " Revolt from the Union," and
</p>
<p>who had struck those words out of the alleged copy of the
</p>
<p>letter containing them which he published in Littell ;  to
</p>
<p>Innes, who knew from Wilkinson the engagements he had
</p>
<p>formed with Miro, and from John Brown's letters, if not
</p>
<p>from Brown's own lips, the nature of the proposition of
</p>
<p>Gardoqui, which had been frustated in the Danville con-
</p>
<p>vention, and yet made no mention of those engagements,

</p>
<p>nor of that proposition, nor of the memorial of Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son, nor of Brown's speech, in his letter to Washington ;
</p>
<p> to Innes, it is scarcely possible that the letter of Caron-
</p>
<p>delet to Sebastian did not suggest that its diplomatic
</p>
<p>phraseology covered a renewal of the old schemes of dis-
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 347
</p>
<p>In his testimony before the leg'islative committee, Judge
</p>
<p>Innes asserted that, while it was not deemed prudent to
</p>
<p>communicate the subject-matter of Carondelet's letter to
</p>
<p>the people, "yet, that it was advisable to know what was
</p>
<p>the object of the Spanish Government upon that import-
</p>
<p>ant subject;"  which, certainly, was sufficiently obvious,
</p>
<p>not only from what had preceded the letter, but from the
</p>
<p>very terms of the letter itself. " To accomplish this ob-
</p>
<p>ject," he said, " it was thought advisable, that as the com-
</p>
<p>munication was made to Mr. Sebastian, he ought to meet
</p>
<p>Colonel Gayoso ; and in consequence of this opinion, Mr.
</p>
<p>Sebastian descended the Ohio." Sebastian himself stated,
</p>
<p>in his deposition in the case of Lines v. Marshall, that he
</p>
<p>carried with him a " written opmo?i,"* signed by Nicholas,
</p>
<p>Innes, Murray and himself, " relative to the situation of
</p>
<p>the two countries "  Louisiana and " The Western coun-
</p>
<p>try "  " and the advantage that would result to both from
</p>
<p>amicable intercourse." Gayoso was disappointed at the
</p>
<p>absence of the others, which Sebastian explained : Innes
</p>
<p>could not leave his courts, and the absence of Nicholas,
</p>
<p>a lawyer in large practice, would excite too much atten-
</p>
<p>tion ; he had come authorized to act for all. According
</p>
<p>to his own account, as subsequently given to Governor
</p>
<p>Greenup, and as detailed by Innes in his testimony before
</p>
<p>the Committee of Investigation, he then proceeded to ar-
</p>
<p>range with Gayoso the terms of the proposed concession
</p>
<p>by the King of Spain to the people of the Western country^
</p>
<p>of the right of navigating the Mississippi, which he and
</p>
<p>Innes alike represented to have been simply an act of
</p>
<p>magnanimous conciliation on the part of his Catholic
</p>
<p>Majesty, without the expectation of any return from
</p>
<p>them other than might spring from the cultivation of
</p>
<p>mutual good will between these people and those of the

<p>Spanish provinces ! But why that good will might not
</p>
<p>just as well have been cultivated by making this conces-
</p>
<p>sion in a treaty with the United States, instead of by
</p>
<p>*Sebastian was asked to produce the original of this " written opin-
</p>
<p>ion," the terms of which would certainly have been interesting ; but,
</p>
<p>of course, it was not accessible to the witness, and was never produced.

</p>
<p>means of this alleged private arrangement, which, on its
</p>
<p>own face, was partial and invidious and exclusive of all
</p>
<p>the rest of their countrymen, never was and never can be
</p>
<p>satisfactorily explained. On his return, in 1796, Sebas-
</p>
<p>tian, according to the testimony of Innes, informed him
</p>
<p>that Gayoso proposed to reduce the duty required from 14
</p>
<p>to 4 per cent; but to this he had objected, insisting that
</p>
<p>the concession being a gracious act of conciliation by the
</p>
<p>king, the navigation should be made absolutely free. Gay-
</p>
<p>oso remaining fixed, Sebastian proceeded with him to
</p>
<p>New Orleans, to refer the matter to Carondelet, who sup-
</p>
<p>ported the latter, but could not immediately attend to the
</p>
<p>definite arrangement of terms.
</p>
<p>In his testimony before the Committee of Investigation,
</p>
<p>Judge Innes presented a paper which he said had been
</p>
<p>given to him by Sebastian as containing the concessions
</p>
<p>proposed by Gayoso, which was in Sebastian's handwrit-
</p>
<p>ing. From this paper it appeared that the King of Spain
</p>
<p>'' had been pleased to cede to the people of the Western
</p>
<p>country, during his pleasure," certain privileges ; among
</p>
<p>which were the use and enjoyment, " for the purpose of
</p>
<p>commerce, of the navigation of the river Mississippi ; and
</p>
<p>all the posts and places thereon, under the Government of
</p>
<p>his Catholic Majesty, subject to the same regulations and
</p>
<p>restrictions, and no other, by which the commerce of the
</p>
<p>subjects of his Catholic Majesty is now governed." The
</p>
<p>importation of any articles into the Spanish territory
</p>
<p>which " were not the actual production of the said West-
</p>
<p>ern country, was absolutely prohibited ;" which excluded
</p>
<p>all the rest of the United States from the benefit of this
</p>
<p>very peculiar treaty. It was never the intention of Spain
</p>
<p>to grant these privileges to the " Western country " so
</p>
<p>long as it continued to be a part of the United States.

<p>Separation therefrom was necessarily implied in every line
</p>
<p>of the letter of Carondelet and of the terms of the pro-
</p>
<p>posed concession. The reader will agree with Butler,
</p>
<p>that, even in the light in which these men claimed that it
</p>
<p>should be regarded, " this proposal, if it had been consum-
</p>
<p>mated, would have amounted to superseding the regular

</p>
<p>operations of the General Government in the Western
</p>
<p>commerce; and would have granted exclusive commercial
</p>
<p>favors to the parties in this agreement, inconsistent with
</p>
<p>the equal constitutional rights of the citizens of a common
</p>
<p>country. It would, moreover, have been the introduction of
</p>
<p>a foreign influence, dangerous to the liberty and peace of the
</p>
<p>nation"
</p>
<p>In a day or two, however, news of the treaty of friend-
</p>
<p>ship, limits and navigation between the United States and
</p>
<p>Spain, of the prospect of which Washington had sent in-
</p>
<p>formation by James Innes in 1794, and which had been
</p>
<p>concluded by John Jay on the part of the United States
</p>
<p>the preceding August, reached New Orleans ;  which su-
</p>
<p>perseded this very nice and extremely innocent private
</p>
<p>and individual negotiation. Urging that the treaty might
</p>
<p>never be carried into effect, Sebastian insisted that Caron-
</p>
<p>delet should sign the terms of the concessions to the
</p>
<p>" people of the Western country." This Carondelet re-
</p>
<p>fused to do, but informed Sebastian, as the latter claimed,
</p>
<p>that he had been instructed to pay to the person who
</p>
<p>should come on that business, the sum of $2,000, and that
</p>
<p>an annual pension of that amount would be paid to him
</p>
<p>thereafter. For making this journey; receiving this vol-
</p>
<p>untary, gratuitous, magnanimous, and, as they represented
</p>
<p>it, most extraordinary and incredible concession from
</p>
<p>Spain to a portion of the people of the United States,
</p>
<p>which that power had, ever since 1783, haughtily denied
</p>
<p>to the whole ; and for drawing up the details of this
</p>
<p>grant, by which, according to their representations, Spain
</p>
<p>gave all and expected to receive nothing, the detected
</p>
<p>pensioner alleged, and his friend, the Federal judge, pro-
</p>
<p>fessed to believe, that the Court of Madrid, pressed with
</p>
<p>debt and with a commerce devastated by ruinous war, had

<p>amounting in the aggregate to $22,000 !
</p>
<p>Gayoso and Sebastian were accompanied from New
</p>
<p>Madrid to JSTew Orleans by Thomas Power, who went for
</p>
<p>the purpose of receiving from Carondelet a round sum of
</p>
<p>money for Wilkinson, which the latter awaited in impa-

<p>350 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>tient expectation. But it had already been sent to Yin-
</p>
<p>cente Folch for delivery to Portell, the commandant at
</p>
<p>New Madrid, who was directed to hold it subject to the
</p>
<p>orders of Wilkinson. Power went with Sebastian by sea
</p>
<p>to New York, and thence, after again seeing Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>back again to NeAV Madrid, where he had great difficulty
</p>
<p>in inducing Portell to deliver to him the money designed
</p>
<p>for Wilkinson without a written order from the latter.
</p>
<p>The reasons why an American general involved in a
</p>
<p>treasonable cons[)iracy, should refuse to give such an order
</p>
<p>were made plain to Portell, who finally delivered the money
</p>
<p>to Power. The amount was $9,640, which was packed in
</p>
<p>sugar barrels ;  for, as Power said, " to take it openly
</p>
<p>would be too scandalous a thing." This was on the 27th
</p>
<p>of June, 1796. Proceeding up the river on his way to
</p>
<p>Cincinnati, Power was stopped at Louisville. He then
</p>
<p>turned the money over to Philip Nolan, Wilkinson's pro-
</p>
<p>tege and confidential agent, by whom it was conveyed to
</p>
<p>Frankfort, and thence to Wilkinson, less $640, detained
</p>
<p>by Power for expenses. Power again visited Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>who gave him instructions for Gayoso, he referring the latter
</p>
<p>in a letter dated September 22, 1796, to the verbal com-
</p>
<p>munications which would be made to. him by Power.
</p>
<p>These instructions Power reduced to writing. They em-
</p>
<p>braced the details which Wilkinson advised as necessary
</p>
<p>to put the plot into successful operation. The mouth of
</p>
<p>the Ohio must be fortified so as to delay an army for a
</p>
<p>year. Fort St. Fernando must be held and strengthened.
</p>
<p>A bank must be established in Kentucky. George Rogers
</p>
<p>Clark must be bought. A number of leading men in
</p>
<p>Kentucky must be purchased, and the press must be sub-
</p>
<p>sidized. Other details were given to Power in the hand-
</p>
<p>writing of Philip Nolan.

<p>The treaty which had been concluded with Spain fixed
</p>
<p>the southern boundary of the United States at 31 north
</p>
<p>latitude, and that the Spanish posts within those limits
</p>
<p>should be surrendered within six months ; that the navi-
</p>
<p>gation of the Mississippi from* its source to its mouth
</p>
<p>should be free to the people of the United States ; and
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 351
</p>
<p>the use of the port of New Orleans as a place of deposit
</p>
<p>and storage was made free from duty to our people. But,
</p>
<p>though the restrictions upon the river trade were sus-
</p>
<p>pended after the ratification of this treaty, Spain never
</p>
<p>intended, if it could in any way be avoided, to surrender
</p>
<p>any portion of the territory of which she held possession.
</p>
<p>The king had yielded a reluctant consent to the treaty
</p>
<p>under the compulsion of embarrassments in both Europe
</p>
<p>and America. He had been on the point of war with
</p>
<p>Great Britain ; an invasion of Upper Louisiana from
</p>
<p>Canada was threatened, and it was to oppose the territory
</p>
<p>of the United States as a friendly neutral as a barrier
</p>
<p>against the apprehended attack that induced him to
</p>
<p>give an apparent consent. The moment the exigency had
</p>
<p>passed means were sought by which the territory could
</p>
<p>be held. In the meantime Caroudelet, viewing the treaty
</p>
<p>in its proper light, as a mere act of finesse, until pressing
</p>
<p>embarrassments should have been surmounted, had been
</p>
<p>active in endeavors to charm success to his favorite plan
</p>
<p>of separating the West from the United States. The time
</p>
<p>had come when the ports must soon be surrendered unless
</p>
<p>something could be efi"ected. Power, on his return to the
</p>
<p>Spanish dominions, again made a favorable report as to
</p>
<p>the disposition of leading men in Kentucky towards these
</p>
<p>schemes of disunion. He was, therefore, commissioned to
</p>
<p>make to Sebastian, Innes, Nicholas and Murray in 1797,
</p>
<p>a proposition in which all that was necessarily implied in
</p>
<p>that of 1795, according to the copies of the letters of Ca-
</p>
<p>rondelet and of the terms submitted in the handwriting of
</p>
<p>Sebastian, was unequivocally expressed. The sum of
</p>
<p>$100,000 was to be placed at the disposition of these gen-
</p>
<p>tlemen as a reward for their own services, and with which
</p>
<p>to bribe others. An additional $100,000 was to be devoted

</p>
<p>to arming and sustaining troops who were to have seized
</p>
<p>upon Fort Massac. Assurance was given that the treaty
</p>
<p>with the United States would never be executed by Spain.
</p>
<p>A communication embodying the details of the proposi-
</p>
<p>tion was delivered by Power to Sebastian, who insisted
</p>
<p>upon the incorporation of a provision stipulating, that, in
</p>
<p>352 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>case of the failure of the plan, those persons who might
</p>
<p>lose their offices by reasons of their efibrts to promote it,
</p>
<p>should be indemnified by the Spanish king. The pious
</p>
<p>Sebastian undertook to make known the proposition to
</p>
<p>his friends, Innes and Nicholas; but Murray had so com-
</p>
<p>pletely lost his respect by drunkenness and infidelity that
</p>
<p>he positively refused to have aught to do with him. He
</p>
<p>accordingly saw Innes, who saw Nicholas, who decided
</p>
<p>that the dishonorable overture " ought to be rejected."
</p>
<p>A paper to this purport was drawn by Nicholas, a copy of
</p>
<p>which was signed by Innes and himself, and was delivered
</p>
<p>by the former to Sebastian. The following is a copy of
</p>
<p>the original amiable document, as it was communicated
</p>
<p>by Innes to the legislative committee, in the handwriting
</p>
<p>of Nicholas, unsigned and without date, viz :
</p>
<p>Sir :  We have seen the communication made by you to Mr. Sebas-
</p>
<p>tian. In answer thereto we declare unequivocally that we will not be
</p>
<p>concerned, either directly or indirectly, in any attempt that may be
</p>
<p>made to separate the western country from the United States. That
</p>
<p>whatever part we may, at any time, be induced to take in the politics
</p>
<p>of our country, that her welfare will be our only inducement, and that
</p>
<p>we will never receive any pecuniary or other reward for any personal
</p>
<p>exertions made by us to promote that welfare.
</p>
<p>The free navigation of the Mississippi must always be the favorite ob-
</p>
<p>ject of the inhabitants of the western country; they can not be con-
</p>
<p>tented without it, and will not be deprived of it longer than necessity
</p>
<p>shall compel them to submit to its being withheld from them.
</p>
<p>We flatter ourselves that every thing respecting this important busi-
</p>
<p>ness will be set right by the governments of the two nations ; but if
</p>
<p>this should not be the case, it appears to us that it must be the policy
</p>
<p>of Spain to encourage by every possible means the free intercourse
</p>
<p>with the inhabitants of the western country, as this will be the most
</p>
<p>efficient means to conciliate their good will, and to obtain, without haz-

</p>
<p>ard and at reduced prices, those supplies which are indispensably neces-
</p>
<p>sary to the Spanish government and its subjects.
</p>
<p>If Nicholas felt the virtuous indignation at this nefari-
</p>
<p>ous proposition which was attributed to him by his friends,
</p>
<p>it must be conceded that he had an admirable command
</p>
<p>of himself ; for there is not a trace thereof in this paper.
</p>
<p>The reader will be forced to agree with Butler that,
</p>
<p>"These otters were entertained 'too gravely, and were re-
</p>
<p>jected with too much tameness for the honor of Kentucky
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 353
</p>
<p>patriotism.'^ But at least one of the signers of that paper
</p>
<p>had been tar too deeply implicated in previous schemes to
</p>
<p>afford to exhibit, even if he felt, an honest wrath at their
</p>
<p>renewal.
</p>
<p>After delivering the communication to Sebastian, Power
</p>
<p>proceeded to Detroit, where he had an interview with
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, whom he informed of the proposals of Caron-
</p>
<p>delet. But the American General knew that he was
</p>
<p>watched on every side, and that he was surrounded by
</p>
<p>men who were true to their country. He received Power
</p>
<p>coldly, exclaiming bitterly : " We are both lost without
</p>
<p>being able to derive any advantage from your journey."
</p>
<p>He said that the scheme was now " a chimerical project ;
</p>
<p>that the inhabitants of the western states, having obtained
</p>
<p>by treaty all they wanted, would not wish to form any
</p>
<p>other political or commercial alliances ; and that they had
</p>
<p>no motive for separating themselves from the other states
</p>
<p>of the Union, even if France and Spain should make them
</p>
<p>the most advantageous offers ; that the fermentations which
</p>
<p>had existed four years back had been appeased." He in-
</p>
<p>sisted that there was no course now left the Spanish except
</p>
<p>to carry out the provisions of the treaty, by which they
</p>
<p>had deprived themselves of their power over the western
</p>
<p>people. And, finally, that in order to avert suspicion,
</p>
<p>Power must -permit himself to be conducted under guard
</p>
<p>to Fort Massac. This was done. At New Madrid, Power
</p>
<p>was met by Sebastian, who delivered to him the reply of
</p>
<p>Nicholas and Innes. Sebastian did not agree with Wilk-
</p>
<p>inson, but encouraged Power still. to hope for ultimate
</p>
<p>success. He, however, made an unfavorable report to
</p>
<p>Carondelet, and thus the last overture of Spain came to
</p>
<p>a fruitless end.

<p>of investigation, the fact that Sebastian had, for ten years
</p>
<p>at least, received an annual pension from Spain, was well
</p>
<p>known to John Brown and Judge Innes as early as Aug-
</p>
<p>ust, 1806. They encouraged Littell to write, and he did
</p>
<p>write, numerous articles for the Palladium, in defense of
</p>
<p>Sebastian, as well as of themselves, after they were in

<p>23

<p>354 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>possession of this positive knowledge, which they concealed
</p>
<p>from their champion. In October, when they had known
</p>
<p>the disgraceful truth for months, they solicited Littell to
</p>
<p>write, and paid him for writing,* and Wm. Hunter for
</p>
<p>publishing, the " Narrative of Political Transactions,"
</p>
<p>which was as much of a defense of Sebastian, whom they
</p>
<p>knew to have been a pensioner of Spain for years, and of
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, as it was of John Brown, Ilary Innes or Caleb
</p>
<p>Wallace;  they w^ere all in the same boat together. Yet
</p>
<p>they still kept the fact of which they had knowledge a
</p>
<p>secret from both writer and publisher. Their intimacy
</p>
<p>was maintained with the pensioner, who was the most
</p>
<p>violent of all in his denunciations of the publications in
</p>
<p>the Western World as lies. They scrupulously withheld
</p>
<p>from their able and zealous advocate all knowledge of the
</p>
<p>intrigues with Thomas Power in 1795-7, and of Sebastian's
</p>
<p>pension, as Littell swore, " until in the (vening after the
</p>
<p>House of Representatives had acceded to the proposition to in-
</p>
<p>quire into the conduct of Sebastian. He (Innes,) then gave
</p>
<p>this deponent information that Sebastian could be proved
</p>
<p>to be a Spanish pensioner." Hunter testified to the same
</p>

<p>The grief of the reader in learning from the " Political Be-
</p>
<p>ginnings," that Humphrey Marshall was " violent, irrelig-
</p>
<p>ious and profane," will be mollified by the assurance given
</p>
<p>in the same work that Hary Innes " was a sincerely religious
</p>
<p>man." It might with equal truth have been stated that
</p>
<p>Caleb Wallace, who had abandoned the Presbyterian pulpit
</p>
<p>to go into politics, kept up his church relations, and prac-
</p>
<p>ticed his devotions with the utmost regularity. Sebastian

<p>* Marshall, Vol. 2, page 399, says that Littell was paid $50 each by-
</p>
<p>Brown, Wallace and Innes, and cheated of the other $50 by Sebastian.
</p>
<p>No mention is made in the depositions read by the writer of the $50
</p>
<p>due by Sebastian. But there is a mention of a " residue " of $50 which
</p>
<p>was paid by Innes in the name of Thomas Todd. The inference is that

<p>when Sebastian failed to pay, the deficit was made up by Todd.

<p>in the depth of his piety, deemed a treasonable overture
</p>
<p>entirely too good to be communicated to an infidel. While
</p>
<p>John Brown, who had absorbed faith as he sat under the
</p>
<p>very droppings of the sanctuary,* it will be cheerfully con-
</p>
<p>ceded was the most devout of the four. On the other hand,
</p>
<p>John Wood, one of the editors of the Western World, whom
</p>
<p>they afterwards bought, was a reprobate ; and young Joseph
</p>
<p>M. Street, whom they could neither bribe nor intimidate,
</p>
<p>and the attempt to assassinate whom proved a failure, was
</p>
<p>a sinner. It is distressing to think that, like Gavin Ham-
</p>
<p>ilton, the latter " drank, and swore, and played at carts."
</p>
<p>It may be that the wickedness of the editors of the West-
</p>
<p>ern World, and the contemplation of their own saintliness,
</p>
<p>justified in the eyes of the four Christian jurists and states-
</p>
<p>men the several little stratagems they devised, and paid
</p>
<p>Littell for introducing into his "Narrative," in order to
</p>
<p>obtain the advantage of the wicked editors in the argu-
</p>
<p>ment. The contrast of their characters made innocent
</p>
<p>those little mutilations by Innes of his own letter to Ran-
</p>
<p>dolph ! The same process of reasoning made laudable John
</p>
<p>Brown's suppression of his Muter letter, his assertion that
</p>
<p>it was identical with the " sliding letter," and his claim
</p>
<p>that the acceptance of Gardoqui's proposition would have
</p>
<p>been consistent with the alleged purpose to make some
</p>
<p>future application for the admission of Kentucky into the
</p>
<p>new Union ! While the suppression of the resolution of
</p>
<p>Wallace and Wilkinson in the July convention, and the
</p>
<p>declaration that such a ^^ motion never was made,'' in order
</p>
<p>to prove the unhappy editors to be liars, became as praise-
</p>
<p>worthy as the spoiling of the Egyptians by the Israelites !

<p>him be true, the able William Littell was also a publican.
</p>
<p>Perhaps that fact made legitimate the supplying him with
</p>
<p>false copies and false information, as well as the conceal-
</p>
<p>ment from him of the intrigues of 1795-7, and their knowl-
</p>
<p>edge of Sebastian's pension ! Littell, however, seems to
</p>
<p>have taken a different view of his treatment by the men
</p>
<p>whom he defended, and to whose confidence he was cer-
</p>
<p>tainly entitled. After detailing in his deposition in the
</p>
<p>case of Innes v. Marshall, that he had undertaken the de-
</p>
<p>fense of all the parties in good faith, believing them to be
</p>
<p>innocent and persecuted ; and the information that was
</p>
<p>furnished him in the Appendix prepared by Innes ; in
</p>
<p>reply to a question by Marshall as to the name of the
</p>
<p>author of an article in the Palladium, in 1807, assailing
</p>
<p>Marshall, to which that of Marshall upon which the suit
</p>
<p>was brought was a reply,  Littell answered : That he did
</p>
<p>not know what article was referred to, nor who wrote it,
</p>
<p>^^for as soon as Sebastian was detected, this deponent directed
</p>
<p>his attention to other objects. He never afterwards lorote any
</p>
<p>thing against Wood, Street, or Marshall, or any other relative
</p>
<p>to the Spanish Conspiracy. He knew that the contest was
</p>
<p>still carried on with the ' Western World,' but he did not
</p>
<p>know or care how or by whom ; he felt no interest in the
</p>
<p>contest, read but few of the publications, and had no inter-
</p>
<p>course with their authors." Which was a decorous way
</p>
<p>of expressing his sense of the ill-usage involved in the
</p>
<p>deceits practiced upon himself; his disgust at having been
</p>
<p>made the instrument for the propagation of, and the palm-
</p>
<p>ing of fraud upon the public; of his own conviction that
</p>
<p>the parties who had thus equivocated and concealed from
</p>
<p>him the truth had been equally guilty with Sebastian of
</p>
<p>intrigue; and that, feeling himself, miserable sinner as he
</p>
<p>was, unfit longer to associate with these  the Lord's saints

<p>he had then and there washed his hands of the confed-
</p>
<p>erates and of all their concerns.
</p>
<p>Before the meeting of the Legislature in November,
</p>
<p>1806, the charge had been published in the Western World,
</p>
<p>by Humphrey Marshall, that Sebastian had been for years
</p>
<p>a stipendiary of Spain. He also drew up an address
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 357
</p>
<p>to the Legislature reciting the fact that Sebastian was a
</p>
<p>Spanish pensioner, and praying an inquiry. A number
</p>
<p>of copies of this address were printed, some of which
</p>
<p>were taken to Woodford, were numerously signed by in-
</p>
<p>dependent farmers of that county, w^ere taken into the
</p>
<p>possession of William Blackburn, the Representative, and
</p>
<p>by him the facts were made known to other members.
</p>
<p>By the 22d of the month the movement had gathered
</p>
<p>such strength that a resolution was offered by Samuel
</p>
<p>McKee, the member from Garrard, that a committee be
</p>
<p>appointed to institute the desired inquiry. A substitute
</p>
<p>therefor was offered by John Pope and was adopted. If
</p>
<p>the newspaper statements of the day are to be credited,
</p>
<p>Sebastian protested his innocence and requested that the
</p>
<p>investigation be delayed, to give him an opportunity to
</p>
<p>procure evidence for its vindication. It is certain, that a
</p>
<p>vigorous effort was made to defeat the resolution and pre-
</p>
<p>vent inquiry, under the pretense of giving the Judge time
</p>
<p>to prepare. But Blackburn presented two addresses and
</p>
<p>petitions from his constituents, which made the charges
</p>
<p>specified in the resolution, and by his determined ex-
</p>
<p>pressions the resolution for the investigation was car-
</p>
<p>ried. Witnesses were sent for, and attended. The receipt
</p>
<p>of the pension by Sebastian, then Judge of the Court of
</p>
<p>Appeals, was absolutel}^ proven by the testimony of
</p>
<p>Thomas Bullitt, of Charles Wilkins and James T. Martin,
</p>
<p>given before the committee on the 27th day of November,
</p>
<p>1806, and by Sebastian's own drafts for the pension and
</p>
<p>letter relating thereto, which were produced. In the af-
</p>
<p>ternoon of that day, and after the facts had been estab-
</p>
<p>lished by this evidence, and not until then, Sebastian
</p>
<p>handed his resignation to Governor Greenup, by wdiom it
</p>
<p>was accepted.

<p>In his letter of resignation the venal Ju-dge admitted
</p>
<p>the receipt of the pension. He claimed, however, that it
</p>
<p>was granted and had been paid for the services he had
</p>
<p>rendered in 1795, the nature of which has been stated.
</p>
<p>There have not been wanting writers who, accepting Se-
</p>
<p>bastian's representations as truthful and candid, contend
</p>
<p>358 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>that his conduct was not even reprehensible. The same
</p>
<p>writers compliment him on the alleged manliness with
</p>
<p>which he avowed all that he had done. Yet to the un-
</p>
<p>biased reader, w4io has read his importunity in 1790, it
</p>
<p>will be apparent that Sebastian confessed only the receipt of
</p>
<p>the pension, which could no longer be denied; that his al-
</p>
<p>legations as to the time that pension commenced and as to
</p>
<p>the service for which it was paid, were inventions to excul-
</p>
<p>pate himself and screen his friends. His corruption and
</p>
<p>the turpitude which had resulted in the iinal exposure of
</p>
<p>his disgrace, both had their origin in 1788, in his collusion
</p>
<p>in the nefarious schemes of James Wilkinson and of John
</p>
<p>Brown.*
</p>
<p>* Benjamin Sebastian was not a native of any of the colonies. He
</p>
<p>was educated for, and for a time officiated as, an Episcopal minister.
</p>
<p>Then became a lawyer, and early drifted to Kentucky. Unlike Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son, he had never worn the American uniform. Unlike Brown, Innes
</p>
<p>and Wallace, in 1788 he held no official position, and betrayed no trust
</p>
<p>by engaging in the schemes which then commenced. It must be borne
</p>
<p>in mind that his communications with the Spaniards at least began
</p>
<p>when he was a private citizen. Had it not been for his complicity in
</p>
<p>the schemes of Wilkinson and Brown in 1788, he might never have been
</p>
<p>corrupted. He was the only one of the conspirators who expiated his
</p>
<p>offense, and thus was the only one entitled to sympathy. He bore his
</p>
<p>punishment uncomplainingly, accepted his position as "scapegoat," and
</p>
<p>never "peached upon his pals." They, on the other hand, hated him

<p>The effort to defeat the investigation of the charges
</p>
<p>against Sebastian, by postponing it on the pretense of
</p>
<p>affording him time for his defense, and his resignation
</p>
<p>after his guilt had been proven, have been stated. The
</p>
<p>next rallying point was the attempt that was made to
</p>
<p>prevent the exposure of others, by dissuading the com-
</p>
<p>mittee from pursuing their investigation and by represent-
</p>
<p>ing that the sole object of their appointment had been at-
</p>
<p>tained in the resignation of Sebastian. The person most
</p>
<p>interested in maintaining this view was Judge Innes.*
</p>
<p> Among the members of the legislature constituting the committee
</p>
<p>was Henry Davidge, afterwards judge of the circuit court of the Shelby
</p>
<p>district. He was made a witness in the suit of Innes v. Marsliall, and,
</p>
<p>on the 10th of June, 1812, gave his deposition in that case. He testified,
</p>
<p>that on the evening of the first day of the investigation, 27th of Novem-
</p>
<p>ber, 1806, and after the guilt of Sebastian had been proven as already
</p>
<p>stated, he went to dine with Governor Greenup, whom he found in the
</p>
<p>public room in conversation with Sebastian. "The judge, upon my en-

</p>
<p>tering the room, rose up apparently in haste, looked about for his hat or
</p>
<p>stick, and immediately disappeared." The governer then informed the
</p>
<p>witness that Sebastian had resigned. The bell for the committee to
</p>
<p>meet again rang, when Davidge proposed to go ; but Greenup told him
</p>
<p>360 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>Kor did lie sernple to exert liimself to prevail upon mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the committee to desist from their inquiry. And
</p>
<p>that he had excellent reason for his concern and anxiety
</p>
<p>can not be disputed. Whether he went voluntarily before
</p>
<p>the committee the next day, or was summoned, does not
</p>
<p>appear from the record.
</p>
<p>His knowledge of the payment of the pension to Sebas-
</p>
<p>tian, since the preceding August, is ascertained from his
</p>
<p>own deposition. The information, he alleged, was then
</p>
<p>given to him by Charles Wilkins, who gave liim a copy
</p>
<p>of a letter from Sebastian to John A. Seitz, deceased, of
</p>
<p>Natchez, which disclosed the truth. When Judge Innes
</p>
<p>thus had the proof laid before him in Sebastian's own
</p>
<p>handwriting of the turpitude of the appellate judge, he
</p>
<p>" observed," as stated by Wilkins, " that he feared Judge
</p>
<p>Sebastian had acted indiscreetly ;"  but whether this indis-
</p>
<p>crction consisted in receiving the pension, or in the careless
</p>
<p>way with Avhich he had exposed his guilty secret, the evi-
</p>
<p>dence of Wilkins did not indicate. In October, thereafter,
</p>
<p>Sebastian admitted the fact to Innes, and made the same
</p>
<p>not to go ; that he intended to go up and certify Sebastian's resignation,
</p>
<p>and he supposed the committee would proceed no further, but if they
</p>
<p>did, he would let Davidge know. Hearing that the committee was in
</p>
<p>session, Davidge started to go to their place of meeting, but on his way
</p>
<p>was informed that the committee had risen to meet again next morn-
</p>
<p>ing, and had determined to proceed with the inquiry notwithstanding
</p>
<p>the judge had resigned. Upon returning to the governor's house he
</p>
<p>found Innes there, who " addressed himself to this deponent and asked
</p>
<p>what the committee had done or were about to do." Upon being in-
</p>
<p>formed of the purpose of the committee, " the plaintiff wished to be
</p>
<p>informed what was the object of the committee in proceeding further ?
</p>
<p>The object of the investigation, he said, was to put the judge out of
</p>
<p>office, nothing further ought or could be done with him." Davidge up-

<p>held the action of the committee, who, he tliought, " ought not to let
</p>
<p>the judge get off in that way." " The plaintiff appeared much con-
</p>
<p>cerned, and asked the deponent if he would say so as a lawyer? This
</p>
<p>deponent, with some degree of earnestness, replied that he would say
</p>
<p>so botli as a lawyer and as a man." "And this deponent seeing the
</p>
<p>plaintiff so much concerned about the committee being determined to
</p>
<p>proceed in the examination, declined to say any thing further. Yet this
</p>
<p>deponent was surprised at the manner of tlie plaintiff's urging the im-
</p>
<p>propriety of the committee's determination to proceed with the investi-
</p>
<p>gation."
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 361
</p>
<p>claim then in regard to tlie matter that he subsequently
</p>
<p>made in his letter of resignation. After thus testifying,
</p>
<p>Innes proceeded to detail the circumstances of the over-
</p>
<p>ture of 1795, as they have already been stated and attrib-
</p>
<p>uted to him in the preceding chapter. His testimony was
</p>
<p>given orally.
</p>
<p>During this examination an incident occurred which
</p>
<p>furnished amusement to some members of the committee,
</p>
<p>but which harassed the judge no little, and was much
</p>
<p>dwelt upon in the depositions subsequently taken in the
</p>
<p>litigation with Marshall. He was asked how his name
</p>
<p>came to be known to the Spanish authorities of Louisiana
</p>
<p>as one with whom they could communicate upon such a
</p>
<p>matter. It was proven by the testimony of Judge George
</p>
<p>M. Bibb and Colonel John Allen,* in the case of Innes v.
</p>
<p>Marshall, with which the less distinct recollections of
</p>
<p>Judge McKee and others corresponded, that Innes replied,
</p>
<p>that the way in which his name had become known to the
</p>
<p>Spanish authorities was, that they had seen his name writ-
</p>
<p>ten in a copy of Sterne's " Sentimental Journey,'' which
</p>
<p>General Wilkinson had carried with him to New Orleans,
</p>
<p>in 1787. The distressed jurist would have had the com-
</p>
<p>passionate committee to believe, that this constituted the
</p>
<p>sole acquaintance with his name and character upon which
</p>
<p>Carondelet had proceeded to select him, a Federal Judge,
</p>
<p>as one of four men in all the West with whom to secretly
</p>
<p>confer upon a subject of this nature ! Ignorant, as the
</p>
<p>members of the committee necessarily were, of the cor-
</p>
<p>respondence between Wilkinson and Miro, there was not
</p>
<p>one of them probably so simple as to have given the
</p>
<p>slightest credence to a claim so supremely absurd. The

<p>familiar to the Spaniards, and the circumstances under
</p>
<p>'This gentleman must not be confounded with Judge John Allen, of
</p>
<p>Bourbon, whose testimony concerning the conventions of 1788 has pre-
</p>
<p>viously appeared. He was a much younger man, and the two were in
</p>
<p>no way related. The Colonel Allen above referred to was killed at the

<p>which it was communicated to Miro by Wilkinson, will
</p>
<p>have a just appreciation of the candor which inspired the
</p>
<p>answer, as well as a clear understanding of the good rea-
</p>
<p>sons Caroudelet had for his confidence that Innes was
</p>
<p>open to approach.
</p>
<p>The testimony of the witnesses in the case referred to
</p>
<p>at this point varied as to whether Innes, after giving his
</p>
<p>version of these transactions of 1795, intimated that he
</p>
<p>was in possession of other information which might not
</p>
<p>be regarded as relevant to the subject under investigation,
</p>
<p>but which he was ready to communicate, and after wait-
</p>
<p>ing some little time, and no question being aslced, left
</p>
<p>the room; or, whether he left without indicating that he
</p>
<p>knew any thing more. The statement of Judge Robert
</p>
<p>Trimble being the most direct and positive in behalf of
</p>
<p>Innes on this point it is here quoted :
</p>
<p>" Mr. Innes then observed that he had detailed to the committee
</p>
<p>every thing he knew on the subject of the pension, or which was imme-
</p>
<p>diately connected with the subject of inquiry before the committee ; but
</p>
<p>that he had some knowledge of other transactions or facts not immedi-
</p>
<p>ately connected therewith. At the time of making the preceding obser-
</p>
<p>vation, Mr. Innes pulled a small bundle of papers out of his coat pocket
</p>
<p>and held them in his hand for some time. No further interrogatory
</p>
<p>was then put to him by the committee, and he put the bundle of papers
</p>
<p>again into his pocket and withdrew from before the committee, with-
</p>
<p>out making any disclosure of the overtures made through Sebastian by
</p>
<p>Thomas Power."
</p>
<p>With this statement of Trimble, those of Colonel Allen,
</p>
<p>Judge Bibb, and others widely differed. Bibb stated that
</p>
<p>Innes retired of his own accord without disclosing the
</p>
<p>overtures of Power in 1797. Allen, that "Mr. Innes gave
</p>
<p>evidence and retired. I thought he was do7ie." Afterwards
</p>
<p>he met Innes in the street; Innes stated " the nature of

<p>his tale as to Power," and asked Allen "whether it was
</p>
<p>matter which should be given in evidence in the inquiry
</p>
<p>committee." Allen thought it should be detailed, but,
</p>
<p>being one of the committee, referred him to Henry Clay,
</p>
<p>to whom Innes shortly after mentioned the matter in
</p>
<p>Allen's presence. Both then expressed the opinion that
</p>
<p>the facts should be detailed. At Innes' request, Allen
</p>
<p>suggested to the committee the recall of Innes, and Innes

</p>
<p>came back and gave his evidence as to the overture of

<p>Power through Sebastian in 1797. In the meantime, how-
</p>
<p>ever, Bibb had seen Innes go into the house of John
</p>
<p>Brown. Judge McKee testified that "Hary Innes was
</p>
<p>examined before the said committee, and this deponent
</p>
<p>believes on oath; and after stating several facts and cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances to the committee, he retired therefrom with-
</p>
<p>out stating that he had further testimony to deliver."
</p>
<p>Henry Davidge deposed, that when Innes concluded his
</p>
<p>testimony concerning the visit of Sebastian to ISTew Or-
</p>
<p>leans in 1795, he, the witness, ''supposed the plaintiff had
</p>
<p>disclosed all the news relative to the subject then before
</p>
<p>the committee ;" and that nothing had then been said by
</p>
<p>Innes about the proposition of Power at a later date. All
</p>
<p>agree, however, that after other witnesses had, in the
</p>
<p>meantime, been examined, but differing as to the length
</p>
<p>of time that had elapsed, Innes again came before the
</p>
<p>committee, in a greatly disturbed, excited and agitated
</p>
<p>condition, and said there was something more connected
</p>
<p>with the subject before the committee to be related. See-
</p>
<p>ing Wood, one of the publishers of the Western Worlds
</p>
<p>present and taking notes, Innes objected and requested
</p>
<p>the committee to interfere.* Innes then testified concern-
</p>
<p>ing the overture of 1797, as appears in preceding pages.
</p>
<p>The proposition then made was but a renewal in detail of
</p>
<p>the old scheme which had been agreed on between Miro
</p>
<p>and Wilkinson, which had been " discussed " between Gar-
</p>
<p>doqui and John Brown, which the latter had agreed to
</p>
<p>" aid," and which these two, with Sebastian, Innes and
</p>
<p>Wallace, had tried to accomplish.
</p>
<p>The witnesses again differed as to the account Innes
</p>
<p>gave in his oral testimony of the response he made to Se-
</p>
<p>bastian, when this proposition was submitted to him for

<p>consideration. Judge Trimble was conscious that his re-
</p>
<p>collection was not distinct. He remembered that Innes
</p>
<p>asserted that " he observed to Sebastian it was a danger-
</p>
<p>ous project, and added something about the Western peo-
</p>
<p>Deposition of Hon. Henry Davidge, in case of Innes v. Marshall.

</p>
<p>pie " which Trimble did not distinctly understand. In con-
</p>
<p>sequence of not distinctly " collecting" " the precise expres-
</p>
<p>sion of Mr. Innes immediately following the remark that it
</p>
<p>was a dangerous project," Trimble " was left in a painful
</p>
<p>suspense " " as to how far Mr. Innes had gone in rejecting or
</p>
<p>repelling the proposition in the first instance, and which
</p>
<p>was not removed until Mr. Innes' written deposition was
</p>
<p>read before the committee." The recollection of George
</p>
<p>Walker and William McMillan was, in substance, in an-
</p>
<p>swer to leading questions, that Innes stated that he had
</p>
<p>remarked to Sebastian that it was a dangerous project and
</p>
<p>ought not to be countenanced; and that on Sebastian urg-
</p>
<p>ing him to see Nicholas, to whom also the communication
</p>
<p>of Power was addressed, he agreed to do so, not that his
</p>
<p>own position should be determined by that of Nicholas,
</p>
<p>but simply that a formal written answer should be made.
</p>
<p>On the other hand. Judge Bibb deposed that :
</p>
<p>" My understanding of said Innes' testimony, as delivered viva voce,
</p>
<p>is clear and distinct, that said Innes did take the paper from Sebastian,
</p>
<p>for the purpose of communicating the said propositions to Colonel Nich-
</p>
<p>olas, telling said Sebastian that he, Innes, waald abide by wJiatever determina-
</p>
<p>tion Colonel Nicholas should make upon tlie subject of those propositions, and
</p>
<p>to show that determination produced a paper which he stated was a
</p>
<p>copy of a written reply signed by Colonel Nicholas and himself, the
</p>
<p>original whereof had been delivered to said Sebastian."
</p>
<p>Judge McKee was equally positive. He said :
</p>
<p>" When the proposition of Doctor Power was submitted to Harry In-
</p>
<p>nes by Benjamin Sebastian, Harry Innes stated before the committee
</p>
<p>that he answered Sebastian by stating that he, Innes, would see Colonel
</p>
<p>Nicholas in a few days, who was one of the persons to whom the over-
</p>
<p>ture was made, and submit the papers to Colonel Nicholas, and they
</p>
<p>would be governed by kis decision. This is the substance of the state-
</p>
<p>ment made before the committee." " This deponent says, that, accord-
</p>

</p>
<p>ing to his recollection, Hary Innes, before the committee, did not state
</p>
<p>any reasons, as having been given to Sebastian, when the proposition
</p>
<p>was made to him; but declined any definitive answer until he ob-
</p>
<p>tained the opinion of Colonel Nicholas. It is in this respect the writ-
</p>
<p>ten deposition differs from that delivered before the committee."
</p>
<p>It will be understood, that, after giving in his testimony
</p>
<p>orally, Judge Innes was permitted to reduce his statement
</p>
<p>to writing, and to submit it in the form of a deposition.
</p>
<p>The above testimony was adduced to show in what respect
</p>
<p>the written diftbred from the oral statement. There was
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 365
</p>
<p>evidence that Iniies requested the committee to point out
</p>
<p>such difference, if any there were, that it might be cor-
</p>
<p>rected before he signed his deposition, and that no such
</p>
<p>correction was desired. Other witnesses did not remem-
</p>
<p>ber this, but did remember that the variance was noticed
</p>
<p>at the time. The following is the statement made in the
</p>
<p>deposition :
</p>
<p>"That Mr. Sebastian came to this deponent's house, some short time
</p>
<p>after receiving the communication, and shewed it to him, upon which
</p>
<p>this deponent observed, that it was a dangerous project, and ought not
</p>
<p>to be countenanced, as the western people had now obtained the navigation of
</p>
<p>the Mississippi, by which all their wishes were gratified. Mr. Sebastian con-
</p>
<p>curred in sentiment, but observed, that Power wished a written answer,
</p>
<p>and requested me to see Colonel Nicholas, saying that whatever we did,
</p>
<p>he would concur in. I promised to visit the Colonel in two or three
</p>
<p>days. This deponent never had any communication with Mr. Murray
</p>
<p>upon the business, nor does he know that Mr. Sebastian ever did in-
</p>
<p>form Mr. Murray of it."
</p>
<p>This version was afterwards supported by Sebastian in
</p>
<p>his deposition in the suit of Innes v. Marshall. Whether
</p>
<p>or not Innes at once rejected the infamous proposal when
</p>
<p>it was communicated by Sebastian, or deferred a decision
</p>
<p>until that of Nicholas had been obtained, the evidence is,
</p>
<p>that, after consulting with that able and distinguished
</p>
<p>man, Innes united with him in the very mild and studi-
</p>
<p>ously inoffensive missive which was returned to Power.
</p>
<p>It will be remarked, however, that, according to Innes'
</p>
<p>own statement, he deemed the proposition "dangerous "
</p>
<p>and one that " ought not to be countenanced," because,
</p>
<p>(" as") " the western people had now obtained the naviga-
</p>
<p>tion of the Mississi})pi, by which all their wishes were
</p>
<p>gratified," and, therefore, could not be induced to embark
</p>
<p>in such a " Revolt from the Union ; "  from which the im-

</p>
<p>plication naturally arises, that, had not European compli-
</p>
<p>cations compelled the Spanish king to disregard the advice
</p>
<p>of Wilkinson, by acquiescing temporarily in that naviga-
</p>
<p>tion, in the treaty he had concluded with the United
</p>
<p>States, the answer of Innes would have been different.
</p>
<p>Wilkinson, who had urged the king never to make the con-
</p>
<p>cession to the United States, was " cool" to Power, on pre-
</p>
<p>cisely the same ground ;  by the treaty the Spaniards had
</p>
<p>366 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>abandoned their power over the western people. The
</p>
<p>witnesses agreed, that, when Innes went before the com-
</p>
<p>mittee tlie second time, after consulting with John Brown,
</p>
<p>who probably advised him that all must come out, and he
</p>
<p>had better anticipate the revelations that would be made
</p>
<p>by others ;  his agitation was extreme. Before informing
</p>
<p>the committee that he had additional communications to
</p>
<p>make, he burst into tears. During the progress of the
</p>
<p>revelation, he lost the power of speech, gasped for breath,
</p>
<p>and seemed in a fainting condition. The committee drew
</p>
<p>away from around him, and the windows were opened to
</p>
<p>give him air. It was, indeed, a most humiliating, sorrow-
</p>
<p>ful, pitiful scene.*
</p>
<p>The impression produced upon the committee by the
</p>
<p>disclosure made by the trembling, h^^sterical, gasping,
</p>
<p>fainting, weeping jurist, may be gathered from the depo-
</p>
<p>sition of Davidge, that " this deponent was surprised that
</p>
<p>these matters did not come out upon the iirst examination
</p>
<p>of the plaintiff before the committee. This deponent, on
</p>
<p>hearing the proposition of Power (in 1797) observed to
</p>
<p>one of the committee, that this w^as the cream of the joke ;
</p>
<p>that the proposition of Power cast light on the whole af-
</p>
<p>fair, and that the deponent could now see into the whole
</p>
<p>mystery ; that the commercial arrangements appeared to
</p>
<p>be more like military operations or preparations." f
</p>
<p>"When giving his testimony in the case of Innes v. Mar-
</p>
<p>shall, lA.o\i. George M. Bibb:J: was reminded that he had
</p>
<p>* Depositions of George M. Bibb, Colonel John Allen, Hon. Henry
</p>
<p>M. Davidp;e and others in re Lines v. Marshall.
</p>
<p>t Davidge testified that " no instance has yet occurred to this depo-
</p>
<p>nent where the feelings of a witness so completely triumphed over his
</p>
<p>philosophy."
</p>
<p>t The deposition of Colonel John Allen is dated " Camp at Wayne's

<p>Battle Ground, near the foot of the rapids of the Miami of the Lake,
</p>
<p>January 13, 1813." In a letter he stated that his ink was freezing as he
</p>
<p>wrote, and that for more than four months his " clothes had not been
</p>
<p>off, except to change a shirt." A few days later he fell at the Raisin.
</p>
<p>His body was never recovered. The " Political Beginnings " having
</p>
<p>stated that Allen was one of the objects of Marshall's rancor, it may be
</p>
<p>proper to state, that, in the deposition Colonel Allen spoke of him as

<p>been a judge of the court of appeals, and was asked :
</p>
<p>"Had a citizen of this state or a foreigner within its ju-
</p>
<p>2'isdiction made to you the proposition herein ascribed to
</p>
<p>Power, had you been a judge possessing criminal jurisdic-
</p>
<p>tion of treason or suspicion of treason, what woukl liave
</p>
<p>been your duty ? " He repHed : " I should have considered
</p>
<p>it my duty to have caused the offender to be apprehended ;
</p>
<p>brought to trial, and not dismissed by my consent or au-
</p>
<p>thority, until he had given security for his good behavior,
</p>
<p>in case the law had provided, or the constituted authori-
</p>
<p>ties had adjudged no greater penalty for such ah offense."*
</p>
<p>" an uncommonly good neighbor ; " that Marshall had, on his removing
</p>
<p>to Frankfort, manifested a friendly disposition towards him, and that
</p>
<p>there had been considerable intercourse between their families, which
</p>
<p>had not been interrupted by their political diiferences. He spoke par-
</p>
<p>ticularly of the kindness of Mrs. Marshall to his family when they were
</p>
<p>in distress, " which had made a lasting impression." The writer has
</p>
<p>personal and definite knowledge, that this friendship was always main-
</p>
<p>tained between the descendants of Humphrey Marshall and those of
</p>
<p>Colonel Allen.
</p>
<p> In the trial of this case this statement of Judge Bibb was probably
</p>
<p>severely felt by the plaintiff. This the writer infers from the fact, that,
</p>
<p>after the trial, his deposition was retaken, .January 1, 1815, apparently
</p>
<p>for the purpose of obtaining some statement which might " let Innes
</p>
<p>down " a little more easily. Bibb was then asked if he had not, after
</p>
<p>this investigation, continued his habits of intimacy with Innes, and ac-
</p>
<p>cepted his invitations to dine. He replied that he " was in the habit of so-
</p>
<p>cial intercourse with the plaintiff, and accepted most willingly his invi-
</p>
<p>tations to his house and to his table." He was then asked by Hum-
</p>
<p>phrey Marshall, whether it was Innes' " own merits, or that of his cook,
</p>
<p>which induced you to attend his dinner parties ? " To this Judge Bibb
</p>
<p>replied: " That he associated with the plaintiff ; believing him to be a
</p>
<p>man of amiable character, an exemplary man in his domestic govern-

<p>ment, of great benevolence. I did not ascribe to him any bad inten-
</p>
<p>tions in relation to the intrigue and conspiracy of Sebastian with the
</p>
<p>Spanish government. My opinion was, and yet is, that Mr. Innes, from
</p>
<p>a natural benevolence and mildness of character, yielded too far to the
</p>
<p>temper of the times, and loarmth of friendship for and confidence in certain
</p>
<p>individuals. If I had thought him criminal I never should have invited
</p>
<p>Mr. Innes (the plaintiff) to my house, nor accepted an invitation to his."
</p>
<p>This statement by Judge Bibb gives expression to the only palliation
</p>
<p>that can be found for the conduct of Judge Innes ; justification is im-
</p>
<p>possible. In a conversation with John Jouitt, in 1815, Humphrey Mar-
</p>
<p>shall said that he had never regarded Innesas personally and privately a
</p>
<p>bad man. And the flagitiousness of his political conduct he attributed

</p>
<p>Judge In lies gave the following as the reason why he
</p>
<p>and Colonel Nicholas did not communicate the proposi-
</p>
<p>tions that had heeu made to the Executive of the United
</p>
<p>States, viz :
</p>
<p>"1st. That it was well known that neither of us approved of Mr. Adams's
</p>
<p>administration, and that we believed he kept a watchful eye over our
</p>
<p>actions, that the communication must depend upon his opinion of our
</p>
<p>veracity ; and it would have the appearance of courting his favor. 2d.
</p>
<p>That we both had reason, and did believe, that the then administration
</p>
<p>were disposed upon the slightest pretext to send an army to this state,
</p>
<p>which we considered would be a grievance upon the people, and there-
</p>
<p>fore declined making any communication upon the subject, as we ap-
</p>
<p>prehended no danger from the Spanish government."
</p>
<p>Of this statement, Perrin, in his History of Kentucky
</p>
<p>(page 300), says, that at the time it was considered " rather
</p>
<p>lame," and that the reasons assigned " were not believed
</p>
<p>to be the true reasons" for the failure to communicate the
</p>
<p>treasonable proposition to the Executive. While the hon-
</p>
<p>est and impartial Ilildreth, discrediting the statement as
</p>
<p>flimsy and ridiculous, distinctly expresses his conviction,
</p>
<p>that secrec}^ was maintained because a disclosure would
</p>
<p>have induced an investigation which would have impli-
</p>
<p>cated Innes in other matters which it was his deep interest
</p>
<p>should remain covered. As between the justice of these
</p>
<p>expressions, and that of Colonel Brown's broad assertion,
</p>
<p>that " no one, w^io will take the trouble to examine the
</p>
<p>testimony given under oath, can have a shadow of doubt"
</p>
<p>of the "perfect rectitude" of Innes, the reader is left to
</p>
<p>determine. Certain it is, however, that among the mem-
</p>
<p>bers of the committee who heard the testimony as it was
</p>
<p>given, and who afterwards testified in the libel suit of
</p>
<p>Innes v. MarshalL there was more than one who did have

<p>misfortunes which embittered the closing years of his life were attrib-
</p>
<p>utable to his intimacy with, and the baneful influence of, James Wilkin-
</p>
<p>son, John Brown, and Sebastian. In the origin of the personal quarrel,
</p>
<p>between Innes and H. Marshall the latter was to blame, and so confessed
</p>
<p>himself. That quarrel was never espoused by any of Marshall's kin-
</p>
<p>dred, none of whom had any share or participation therein, and not one
</p>
<p>of whom ever manifested or cherished the slightest personal ill will
</p>
<p>against Innes on that or any other account.

</p>
<p>very grave doubts of the rectitude of the Federal Judge.
</p>
<p>Eor were those doubts contined to them ; they were shared
</p>
<p>by the people and by many of the prominent men of the
</p>
<p>Commonwealth. The judgment of the committee was,
</p>
<p>that the intercourse of Sebastian w^ith the agents of the
</p>
<p>Spanish Government, a part of which certainly was with
</p>
<p>the confessed approbation and connivance of Innes, was
</p>
<p>" illicit, unjustiliable, and highly criminal, subversive of
</p>
<p>every duty he owed to the constituted authorities of our
</p>
<p>country, and highly derogatory to the character of Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky."
</p>
<p>Still no direct censure had been passed upon the Judge
</p>
<p>of the Federal Court by name. That he remained unmo-
</p>
<p>lested was unquestionably not attributable to any convic-
</p>
<p>tion on the part of those in authority that there was no
</p>
<p>culpability in his own conduct, nor in the concealment of
</p>
<p>the treasonable proposition which had been made to him,
</p>
<p>but solely to the fact that the concealment had been prac-
</p>
<p>ticed during the administration of John Adams, who had
</p>
<p>been succeeded by Mr. Jefferson, of whom Innes had
</p>
<p>been a devoted partisan.*
</p>
<p>* In 1797, the Federal army, which Innes was so fearful might be
</p>
<p>gent to Kentucky, was under the command of his friend, James Wil-
</p>
<p>kinson.

<p>of what he conceived to be equal justice upon Innes, Plum-
</p>
<p>phrey Marshall now determined to announce himself as a

<p>candidate for a seat in the next Legislature. The Federal

<p>party, of which he was the ablest and most conspicuous

<p>member then in Kentucky, was dead beyond the power

<p>of resurrection. His vote for the ratification of the

<p>had saved the people from anarchy and all the evils that

</p>
<p>advantages ;  for a vote which gave peace and averted war,
</p>
<p>guarded our honor and promoted our interests and wel-
</p>
<p>fare, he had been denounced as a friend of monarchy, an
</p>
<p>enemy of liberty, and had been villified as though he had
</p>
<p>been the vilest of malefactors. To his other ofienses as a
</p>
<p>senator had been added the crime of the ardent support
</p>
<p>he had given the administrations of Washington and
</p>
<p>Adams, in their patriotic efforts to establish public credit,
</p>
<p>to maintain the national honor, to avert strife, to uphold

<p>the Constitution, and to preserve the Union against the
</p>
<p>foes by wdiom they were assailed jon every side. As a Fed-
</p>
<p>eralist the odium excited by the Alien and Sedition law was
</p>
<p>visited upon him. He had refused absolutely to obey in-
</p>
<p>structions when they conflicted with his own matured
</p>
<p>convictions of justice and right and the interests and wel-
</p>
<p>fare of the whole country. Disdaining to temporize with
</p>
<p>wrong, scorning all that savored of equivocation, he cour-
</p>
<p>ageously maintained against all comers the principles and
</p>
<p>policy of the defeated and disbanded party. The national
</p>
<p>administration was in the hands of an enemy to all of his
</p>
<p>name and kindred. The state administration was con-
</p>
<p>trolled by his own implacable foes. With many of the
</p>
<p>prominent men of the state he had been involved in the
</p>
<p>most acrimonious political and personal controversies.
</p>
<p>Seldom was any man so maliciously traduced. The as-
</p>
<p>saults by insignificant tools of others were treated with
</p>
<p>contemptuous indifference. But the leaders among his
</p>
<p>antagonists who assailed him had abundant cause for
</p>
<p>regret.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, Innes, a generous, hospitable and
</p>
<p>amiable man, much beloved for his personal qualities, was
</p>
<p>surrounded by a large, respectable and influential family

<p>sonal interests were identified with his own, and who had
</p>
<p>at their back all that prestige of success and wealth can
</p>
<p>bring. It was under these circumstances, in a community
</p>
<p>in which he had been grossly outraged by mob violence,
</p>
<p>that Marshall, single handed and alone, openly avowing
</p>
<p>372 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>his object, entered the canvass against all odds, and ap-
</p>
<p>pealed to the people whom he had never courted or flat-
</p>
<p>tered, upon the facts established by the record. He was
</p>
<p>elected, and, on the same issue, was re-elected to the suc-
</p>
<p>ceeding Legislature; from this circumstance, which Colo-
</p>
<p>nel Brown fails to mention, may be gathered the contem-
</p>
<p>porary judgment upon the evidence as passed by the
</p>
<p>community in which both men lived.
</p>
<p>Having thus obtained a popular verdict, in January, 1808,
</p>
<p>Humphrey Marshall j)resented resolutions to the Ken-
</p>
<p>tucky House of Representatives looking to an investiga-
</p>
<p>tion into the conduct of Innes by Congress. They were
</p>
<p>opposed by Mr. Clay, on the ground that they constituted
</p>
<p>an expression of opinion and tended to prejudice Innes.
</p>
<p>They were not adopted, and Mr. Clay's substitute therefor
</p>
<p>was also rejected. The substance of Marshall's resolu-
</p>
<p>tions was then embodied in others which were presented
</p>
<p>by William Blackburn, and were adopted by both
</p>
<p>branches of the General Assembly, which were transmit-
</p>
<p>ted to Congress, and which fairly reflect the sentiment
</p>
<p>and judgment not only of that legislative body, but of the
</p>
<p>most moderate and conservative of the candid and think-
</p>
<p>ing people of the State at that time, viz.:
</p>
<p>" Inasmuch as it has been deemed expedient to express the public
</p>
<p>opinion on subjects of general concern, as the means of union among
</p>
<p>members of the same community, or as indications of the public, serving
</p>
<p>as guides to public servants in their ofiicial conduct ; and whereas, from
</p>
<p>representations made to the General Assembly by the introduction of a
</p>
<p>resoUition, and upon the application of Harry Innes, Esq., by letter di-
</p>
<p>rected to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and by him laid
</p>
<p>before that house praying an examination into the cliarges exhibited
</p>
<p>against him in said resolution, and from evidence to them exhibited, it
</p>
<p>appears that the said Harry Innes, Esq., while sole judge of the Federal
</p>
<p>Court, for the Kentucky district, had knowledge of various intrigues

<p>and secret negotiations liaving been at diflerent times carried on by the
</p>
<p>agents and emissaries of a foreign government with citizens of this
</p>
<p>State, liostile to the. peace and tranqmllty of the Union ; particularly in the
</p>
<p>case of the Baron de Carondelet, and in the case of Thomas Power,
</p>
<p>agents and emissaries of the King of Spain ; and the said Harry Innes,
</p>
<p>Esq., possessing a complete knowledge of propositions having been
</p>
<p>made to himself and others, citizens of the Western country, by the
</p>
<p>flaid Carondelet and Power, which had for their object the dismember-

<p>ment of the Union ; and having failed to communicate to the Federal Execu-

<p>tive, or to lake any measures of prevention, as by the duties of his office he was
</p>
<p>bound to do; and the conduct of the said Harry Innes, Esq., in this par-
</p>
<p>ticular having been such as to excite great public discontent, and a suspicion
</p>
<p>that he participated in the intrigues and secret negotiations aforesaid.
</p>
<p>" The Legislature deem those circumstances in the conduct of the said
</p>
<p>Harry Innes, Esq., as furnishing an occasion of sufficient magnitude to
</p>
<p>interest the attention of the representatives of the people of Kentucky,
</p>
<p>and to call forth the expression of their opinion ; therefore,
</p>
<p>" Resolved, By the Senate and House of Representatives, That the. con-
</p>
<p>duct of the said. Harry Innes, Esq., relative to the secret negotiations of the said
</p>
<p>Carondelet and Power, ought to be inquired into by the constituted authorities of
</p>
<p>the United States.
</p>
<p>" Also resolved, That the Governor of this State be requested to trans-
</p>
<p>mit a copy of the forgoing resolutions to each of the representatives of
</p>
<p>this State in the Congress of the United States."
</p>
<p>These resolutions were adopted b}^ a general assembly
</p>
<p>inimical to the political views of Marshall ; they did not
</p>
<p>utter his personal ill will, but gave a voice to the deliber-
</p>
<p>ate sentiment of the representatives of the people as to
</p>
<p>what was due to the honor and dignity of the Common-
</p>
<p>wealth which they deemed to have been outraged by the
</p>
<p>federal judge. They were transmitted to Congress, and
</p>
<p>were by that body referred to a committee. The report
</p>
<p>of that committee did not acquit Innes of culpability nor
</p>
<p>of criminality ; it simply stated that in the opinion of the
</p>
<p>committee the proofs which accompanied the resolutions
</p>
<p>of the legislature were not sufficient upon which to im-
</p>
<p>peach the district judge. It was an evasion of the request
</p>
<p>for an investigation, which would have exposed many a
</p>
<p>skeleton, and which the committee therefore deemed it
</p>
<p>inexpedient to institute. The sketch of Judge Innes,
</p>
<p>published by Collins, mentions that charges against him
</p>
<p>were ignored by Congress, but it gives no clue to the na-
</p>
<p>ture of those charges, and suppresses the fact that they

<p>were made by the legislative power of the state in which
</p>
<p>he lived, controlled by the party of which he was a mem-
</p>
<p>ber. And the " Political Beginnings," while asserting
</p>
<p>that Innes was vindicated by the investigation of the
</p>
<p>charges against Sebastian, conceals the fact that one of
</p>
<p>the results of that investigation, was this formal action of
</p>
<p>the General Assembly of 1807-8.
</p>
<p>In his Centennial Address Colonel Brown did not hesi-
</p>
<p>374 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>tate to stigmatize as " malevolent slander" the imputa-
</p>
<p>tions upon Innes published by Humphrey Marshall and
</p>
<p>thus indorsed by the people of the county in which they
</p>
<p>lived and- by both branches of the legislature. In that
</p>
<p>address it is boldly asserted, that " the litigation between
</p>
<p>Innes and Marshall, in 1806, developed the evidence that
</p>
<p>gave his merited vindication ;" and that " by this prose-
</p>
<p>cution for libel, his pure and unfaltering patriotism was
</p>
<p>vindicated in the eyes of even his persecutors.''' The same
</p>
<p>address states, that "the suit against Marshall was con-
</p>
<p>tinued several times and finally dismissed upon a written
</p>
<p>agreement that all personal differences should be buried
</p>
<p>in oblivion, and that neither should write or publish any
</p>
<p>thing of or concerning the other disrespectful in terms or
</p>
<p>inference, or touching upon any subject of controversy
</p>
<p>that had existed. It was an ill-kept agreement." The
</p>
<p>author of that address, referring to a number of public
</p>
<p>men who were not accused of complicity in the Spanish
</p>
<p>intrigues, states, in the " Political Beginnings," that
</p>
<p>" the}^ gave their testimony in the suits for libel which
</p>
<p>Hary Innes brought against the historian Marshall, as
</p>
<p>author, and Street, the newspaper proprietor, as publisher,
</p>
<p>and their statements under oath are worthy of credence, and
</p>
<p>should settle the dispute forever" [page 164.] In the same
</p>
<p>remarkable work, it is asserted, that the results of the in-
</p>
<p>vestigation in the case of Sebastian, and of the suits
</p>
<p>against Street and Marshall, " vindicated Innes, who was
</p>
<p>chiefly attacked. Street was mulcted in damages that
</p>
<p>ruined him. Marshall agreed to refrain in future from
</p>
<p>assaults on Innes if the suit was dropped, and it was
</p>
<p>therefore discontinued," [page 216,] and that "the records
</p>
<p>of those controversies show that no man who was present at
</p>
<p>any of these conventions knew, or believed, or, suspected,
</p>
<p>that Brown or Innes had. ever entertained a thought other

</p>
<p>than that of entering the Union as a sovereign state, or a
</p>
<p>plan consistent with that thought." And this last state-
</p>
<p>ment was made directly in the face of the depositions of
</p>
<p>Judge John Allen, of Bourbon, of Colonel Joseph Crock-
</p>
<p>ett, and of French, all of which Colonel Brown had read;
</p>
<p>\
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 375
</p>
<p>of the letter of Colonel Marshall, which he had also read ;
</p>
<p>and of the letters of Muter, which were published in the
</p>
<p>paper with which he was familiar !
</p>
<p>But the attention of the reader is now directed to the
</p>
<p>evident purpose of Colonel Brown to create the impression
</p>
<p>that Street, '' as publisher " and Humphrey Marshall, " s
</p>
<p>author,'' were sued for libel contained in the same publica-
</p>
<p>tion or publications ; that Street, " as publisher" was
</p>
<p>mulcted in damages that ruined him on account of libel in
</p>
<p>an article which Marshall had written ; while Marshall,
</p>
<p>" as author," sneaked out of the trouble in which he had
</p>
<p>involved Street, by promising " never to do so any more."
</p>
<p>No other interpretation can be placed on Colonel Brown's
</p>
<p>statements on pages 164 and 216 of his book. Now, the
</p>
<p>fact as it existed, as it was proved, and as Colonel Brown
</p>
<p>knew it to be, is this : That the articles, upon wliich Street
</p>
<p>was sued and mulcted, were published in 1806; that Street
</p>
<p>himself deposed, in the case of Innes v. 31a.rshall, " that
</p>
<p>the matter upon which the suit at Jessamine (that against
</p>
<p>Street) was predicated, was this deponent's own composition ;"
</p>
<p>that Street testified that he " was irresistibly led to the
</p>
<p>conclusions in those publications by a serious, candid and
</p>
<p>liberal examination of the testimony delivered by Judge
</p>
<p>Innes before the committee in the case of Sebastian ; "
</p>
<p>that Street further testified that the charge published in
</p>
<p>the Palladiam that Humphrey Marshall had furnished the
</p>
<p>information upon which the articles in reference to the
</p>
<p>" Spanish conspiracy were founded " " was untrue ;" and
</p>
<p>" that he did not receive the matter relative to the Spanish
</p>
<p>conspiracy from the defendant." The article, on the
</p>
<p>other hand, upon which Marshall was sued, was published
</p>
<p>months later, in answer to abusive assaults made upon
</p>
<p>Marshall himself, and no claim was ever made upon Street
</p>
<p>on account thereof. The fact remains, that no verdict

</p>
<p>was ever obtained against any one for libel contained in
</p>
<p>any article written by Marshall, or which was based upon
</p>
<p>information he had furnished.
</p>
<p>The reader has not failed to observe, that in the extracts
</p>
<p>published from the address and from the " Beginnings "
</p>
<p>376 The Sjxiinsh Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>there is no intimation that the suit against Marshall ever
</p>
<p>went to trial. The address and the book may be searched
</p>
<p>from their beginning to their closing sentences without
</p>
<p>the detection of a hint that the case ever went to a jury.
</p>
<p>The author of those unique papers would have been seri-
</p>
<p>ously inconsistent with himself, and would have been as
</p>
<p>seriously embarrassed in his purpose, had he failed to con-
</p>
<p>ceal the fact of the trial and of its results from his readers.
</p>
<p>Ko other inference can be drawn from his language than
</p>
<p>that the evidence taken by deposition was so absolutely
</p>
<p>conclusive of the innocence of Innes ; that the charges
</p>
<p>made by Marshall on account of which the suit had been
</p>
<p>brought were not only so utterly unsupported by the testi-
</p>
<p>mony, but were shown to be so wholly unfounded, that
</p>
<p>Innes was completely vindicated in the eyes of Marshall
</p>
<p>himself; and that, without a trial, and at Marshall's re-
</p>
<p>quest, in order to avoid a result similar to that which had
</p>
<p>ruined Street, the suit was withdrawn upon Marshall's
</p>
<p>promise to desist in the future. That this impression
</p>
<p>would be created by Colonel Brown's language, and that
</p>
<p>he intended to produce it, are alike unquestionable. When
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown wrote those papers he was in possession of
</p>
<p>the records of that suit and was fully acquainted with all
</p>
<p>the facts. The suit was brought because of a communica-
</p>
<p>tion published by Marshall in the Western World, on the
</p>
<p>16th of July, 1807, in reply, as already stated, to violent
</p>
<p>and abusive assaults made upon him in the Palladium by
</p>
<p>the friends of Innes. In this communication he referred
</p>
<p>to Innes as a "Judge, weak, partial, and an enemy to the
</p>
<p>Government f^ as " 2^, faithless -public servant and an oppressor
</p>
<p>of private rights f as " a judge who still holds his office to
</p>
<p>the public degradation and disgrace of our country ; a judge
</p>
<p>whom I rank with an Arnold, a Blount and a Sebastian."
</p>
<p>Innes brought suit upon those words, but allowed term

<p>after term to pass without Uling his declaration, until a
</p>
<p>rule was issued against him to file, and then the case was
</p>
<p>dismissed on account of his failure. This was in 1808. At
</p>
<p>the March term of 1809 it was reinstated, the declaration
</p>
<p>was filed and the appearance of the defendant was entered.
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 377
</p>
<p>From the first Marshall avowed that he had written the
</p>
<p>words in question, affirmed their truth and justified every
</p>
<p>word. After various special pleas, demurrers, amend-
</p>
<p>ments, answers, etc., Marshall plead to the general issue,
</p>
<p>which Innes joined, at the July term of 1810. At the
</p>
<p>October term of the same year the case was, by consent,
</p>
<p>transferred from the Franklin to the Mercer Circuit
</p>
<p>Court, where it came on for final trial on the 8th of June,
</p>
<p>1814.
</p>
<p>Marshall was without political influence ; Innes was an
</p>
<p>influential member of the dominant party. Marshall had
</p>
<p>many enemies made by his bold championship of national
</p>
<p>principles and his fierce denunciation of what he held to
</p>
<p>be criminal practices ; Innes was kindly and conciliatory,
</p>
<p>and Church and State and official position were at his
</p>
<p>back. To Marshall, of whose sincerity in preferring the
</p>
<p>charges there could be no doubt, the question was merely
</p>
<p>pecuniary ; and, without being distressed thereby, he could
</p>
<p>have met all the damages claimed. To the unhappy Innes,
</p>
<p>on the contrary, the issue was one of character and repu-
</p>
<p>tation and of personal disgrace. Thus the case was given
</p>
<p>a semi-criminal aspect, in which Innes was the person actu-
</p>
<p>ally on trial, and to him naturally drifted the current of
</p>
<p>sympathy. Upon Marshall rested the entire burden of the
</p>
<p>proof. It devolved on him to verify his charges, not upon
</p>
<p>Innes to disprove them. One of those charges made most
</p>
<p>prominent in the issue by Innes was that, as a judge, he
</p>
<p>had been "weak, partial" and "w oppressor of private
</p>
<p>rights." If Marshall failed to sustain that charge also, he
</p>
<p>lost his case, no matter how conclusive might be the evi-
</p>
<p>dence on all other points. The trial, in which Innes thus
</p>
<p>had every advantage except that of the facts on his side,
</p>
<p>occupied ten days. It was then announced that the jury
</p>
<p>could not agree. In his History Marshall states that five of

</p>
<p>the jury were for giving Innes damages, if for only one
</p>
<p>cent; while the other seven said no, not a cent shall he
</p>
<p>have.
</p>
<p>E'ow, in the insinuating and expressive language of
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown, it is " passing strange," indeed, if all the
</p>
<p>378 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>evidence so completely and thoroughly vindicated Innes,
</p>
<p>and established that Marshall had for so many years pur-
</p>
<p>sued and hounded him with malignant slander, with totally
</p>
<p>unfounded and unsupported accusations of oflenses so dis-
</p>
<p>graceful to him as a man and judge; that, in the absence
</p>
<p>of any testimony whatever to justify Marshall, and such
</p>
<p>an overwhelming mass of irrefragible proof of the inno-
</p>
<p>cence and purity of Innes, as represented by Colonel
</p>
<p>Brown ;  if that were true, it would be most astounding
</p>
<p>that the jury who heard it all could not be persuaded to
</p>
<p>give the persecuted man even one cent as a salvo. That
</p>
<p>Colonel Brown felt the full significance of this refusal is
</p>
<p>evidenced by the concealment in which he had refuge.
</p>
<p>A year later Marshall met John Jouitt, a friend of
</p>
<p>Innes, and stated that he had no fear that Innes could ever
</p>
<p>obtain a verdict against him ; that the suit had been on for
</p>
<p>eight years, had already cost Innes and himself a great
</p>
<p>deal of money, and seemed to be as far from a conclusion
</p>
<p>as ever. In the meantime they had both grown old ; and
</p>
<p>his own business affairs needed the time occupied in de-
</p>
<p>fending the suit ; under these circumstances he was will-
</p>
<p>ing that it should be marked settled and be dismissed,
</p>
<p>each party paying his own costs. As to the future, an agree-
</p>
<p>ment was reached that neither party would write or speak
</p>
<p>disrespectfully of the other concerning what was past.
</p>
<p>On these terms, leaving all that Marshall had written and
</p>
<p>published unretracted, unqualified, and sustained by legal
</p>
<p>proof which, if not so absolutely conclusive as a mathe-
</p>
<p>matical demonstration might have been, was at least so
</p>
<p>weighty as to satisfy some, and probably a majority
</p>
<p>of the jury which tried the case, that the characteriza-
</p>
<p>tions used by Marshall were as deserved as the evi-
</p>
<p>dence by which he justified them was clear and abundant, 
</p>
<p>the suit was dismissed by the judge, who had brought it

<p>for the vindication of his patriotism and official integrity !
</p>
<p>The reader will agree that the " complete vindication "
</p>
<p>which Colonel Brown coolly asserts, that Innes received
</p>
<p>as the results of these legislative and judicial inquiries, as
</p>
<p>seen in the report of the committee which investigated
</p>
<p>The Spanish Conspiracy. 379
</p>
<p>the charge against Sebastian ; in the popuUir verdict ren-
</p>
<p>dered in the election of Humphrey Marshall to the Legis-
</p>
<p>lature from Franklin county, upon the open issue that it
</p>
<p>was his purpose to inaugurate steps for the impeachment
</p>
<p>of Innes; in the resolutions passed by both branches of
</p>
<p>the Assembly looking to that action by Congress; and in
</p>
<p>the refusal of the jury to give him a verdict in the suit he
</p>
<p>brought, was one of which no one would ever boast, and
</p>
<p>which his rash champion might well have declined to
</p>
<p>mention, Nor does a careful sifting of the testimony
</p>
<p>relieve the unfavorable impression made by these opinions
</p>
<p>of committee, people, LegisUxture and jury. And the sug-
</p>
<p>gestion must forcibly, as unavoidably, present itself to ev-
</p>
<p>ery mind, that had the letters of his friend, Wilkinson,
</p>
<p>which have since been obtained from the Spanish archives,
</p>
<p>been then produced in evidence before that committee, be-
</p>
<p>fore that Legislature, before the Congress, or before the
</p>
<p>jury, the results would have been yet more unfortunate
</p>
<p>for the amiable, but unhappy and ill guided judge.
</p>
<p>In 1788 the laws of Virginia denounced as high treason
</p>
<p>the attempt to erect a State within her limits without her
</p>
<p>consent'previously obtained. That state had adopted the
</p>
<p>Constitution and had become a part of the new Union.
</p>
<p>John Brown was one of her Congressmen. As her Attor-
</p>
<p>ney it was the duty of Innes to prosecute infractions of
</p>
<p>her laws; as one of her Judges it was that of Wallace to
</p>
<p>enforce the penalty. The degree of turpitude involved in
</p>
<p>the schemes herein disclosed may safely be left to casuists to
</p>
<p>determine. What the conspirators themselves thought of
</p>
<p>those schemes is exhibited by their attempts at conceal-
</p>
<p>ment. What their latest champion thought of them is
</p>
<p>shown by his painful attempts to repel the charges and to
</p>
<p>suppress the evidence that manifests their justice. Before

<p>formed by Madison of the declaration of Congress that the
</p>
<p>navigation of the Mississippi was an " essential right of the
</p>
<p>United States."
</p>
<p>The reader has seen how the "Political Beginnings"

<p>380 The Spanish Conspiracy.
</p>
<p>plays at shuttlecock and battledore with Jolin Brown ; 
</p>
<p>how on one page it represents hirn as knowing nothing of
</p>
<p>the Jay project until March, 1787, and nothing of the
</p>
<p>action of Virginia until the following May; and how on
</p>
<p>another page it represents him as " procuring " that action
</p>
<p>in the preceding November. He has observed how the
</p>
<p>statement in that book, that the object of John Brown's
</p>
<p>resolution in the November convention was to secure an
</p>
<p>immediate application to Congress for admission to the
</p>
<p>Union, is flatly contradicted by John Brown's own state-
</p>
<p>ment in Littell ;  which not only relegates that applica-
</p>
<p>tion to some indelinite time in the future, but confesses
</p>
<p>that an inducement to adopt the resolution Avas the pros-
</p>
<p>pect of obtaining from Spain the navigation of the Missis-
</p>
<p>sippi, which the author of that resolution knew could
</p>
<p>only be had by separating from the United States. That
</p>
<p>condition, which was concealed from the readers of Littell,
</p>
<p>was known to the author of the "Beginnings," who de-
</p>
<p>tected the fraud his ancestor had endeavored to palm upon
</p>
<p>the people. The author of the "Beginnings" also saw,
</p>
<p>as plainly as the reader sees it, that after John Brown had
</p>
<p>received the overture of Gardoqui ; had then sought the
</p>
<p>Spaniard at his own house for further communication on
</p>
<p>that subject ; had thanked his tempter for having so ap-
</p>
<p>j)roached him and promised to " aid " in the plan ; had
</p>
<p>written the Muter and similar letters with the Spaniard's
</p>
<p>'permission ; had come home and consulted with the Span-
</p>
<p>ish-bought Wilkinson and others whom he supposed
</p>
<p>favorable to the scheme ; had cooperated with Wilkinson
</p>
<p>in the November convention ; had there offered a resolu-
</p>
<p>tion designed to separate Kentucky from Virginia, and
</p>
<p>necessarily, under the circumstances then existing, from the
</p>
<p>Union ; and that then, according to his own statement in
</p>
<p>Littell, he had disclosed the overture of Gardoqui as an

<p>inducement to adopt his own resolution ;  he saw that,
</p>
<p>after all this, his grandsire's poor plea, to avoid the conclu-
</p>
<p>sions which all must reach from his acts, that lie had not
</p>
<p>advocated the acceptance of the overture by the convention,
</p>
<p>was weak, puerile, and contemptible. W he did not, tlie

</p>
<p>reader can judge whether it was because of his patriotism,
</p>
<p>or, as stated by Wilkinson, it was due to his timidity.
</p>
<p>Admitting by unmistakable implication that had John
</p>
<p>Brown spoken as represented by Humphrey Marshall', he
</p>
<p>"spoke treasonably;" and feeling that if John Brown
</p>
<p>spoke as he himself stated in Littell that he had spoken,
</p>
<p>it was yet worse for him than as represented by Mar-
</p>
<p>shall ;  the "Beginnings" suppresses the statement made
</p>
<p>by Littell, suppresses also all the evidence which confirms
</p>
<p>that made by Marshall ;  and endeavors to extricate John
</p>
<p>Brown from his difficulty by asserting, that he kept the
</p>
<p>overture of Gardoqui a profound secret from all but Mc-
</p>
<p>Dowell and Muter, by boldly aflirming that John Brown
</p>
<p>deemed it inexpedient to narrate to the convention what
</p>
<p>Gardoqui had said, lest rash men might make trouble by ad-
</p>
<p>vocating what Gardoqui had proposed ; and by laboriously
</p>
<p>arguing that the " quotation," which he knew was a repe-
</p>
<p>tition of what Colonel Marshall had written, was a coinage
</p>
<p>out of the malice of the historian Marshall, The reader has
</p>
<p>seen what were the facts ; knows how that " quotation "
</p>
<p>was confirmed by every witness who wrote or spoke in
</p>
<p>reference thereto, was admitted substantially by the ques-
</p>
<p>tions of Innes, and w^as challenged by no one ; and knows
</p>
<p>also how the assertion in the " Beginnings " is refuted by
</p>
<p>that which John Brown himself authorized Littell to
</p>
<p>make in the " Narrative," These tortuous concealments
</p>
<p>of the evidence, these pitiful efi:brts to evade the facts,
</p>
<p>these statements which are so emphatically contradicted
</p>
<p>by John Brown himself, and these shameless accusa-
</p>
<p>tions of others, render the "Beginnings," instead of the
</p>
<p>" vindication " for which it was designed by its author,
</p>
<p>a sorrowful, a painful and a most sickening confession
</p>
<p>of the author's own conviction of John Brown's guilt,
</p>
<p>and of his detection of John Brown's deceits in his efforts

<p>to conceal that guilt. It surely is not necessary to recapi-

<p>course pursued by the grandson in his morbid desire to

<p>ened it, and his perception, after a careful investigation.

<p>that it could be done in no other way. But, alas! what
</p>
<p>must that cause have been for which this was the best that
</p>
<p>can be done !  how utterly desperate, when a well
</p>
<p>equipped and able advocate, possessing linguistic facility
</p>
<p>and the literary art, a careful and laborious reader and a
</p>
<p>diligent student, after exhausting all the resources from
</p>
<p>which the materials for a defense can be drawn, found
</p>
<p>that this was a necessity !
</p>
<p>And the reader will admit that, unfortunate as the federal
</p>
<p>judge himself had been in the results of the several in-
</p>
<p>vestigations, referred to in the " Beginnings," his memory
</p>
<p>has sustained yet more serious injury, by the useless and
</p>
<p>wanton resuscitation in that remarkable production of
</p>
<p>these unsavory political reminiscences;  which had been
</p>
<p>w^ell nigh forgotten in the stirring scenes of the recent
</p>
<p>past ;  and which the friends of the descendants of Judge
</p>
<p>Innes, among whom were included the kindred of his ad-
</p>
<p>versary, were most anxious should be forever buried.
</p>
<p>There is no need to dwell longer upon the infelicit}^ which
</p>
<p>has attended this latest effort at a much needed, but im-
</p>
<p>possible, " vindication." The misrepresentation that Innes
</p>
<p>had moved, prepared, reported, and advocated the address
</p>
<p>to the Virginia Assembly ; the false pretense that Owen
</p>
<p>had been murdered within Spanish territory, and that the
</p>
<p>American courts had no jurisdiction over the crime of his
</p>
<p>murderers ; the suppression of the evidence of Allen and

</p>
<p>of the Legislature, and of the fact and result of the trial
</p>
<p>of the libel suit ;  all unite in the absolute demonstration
</p>
<p>that, in Colonel Brown's own opinion, after the most la-
</p>
<p>borious and careful examination, neither could the inno-
</p>
<p>cence of Innes be maintained, nor the candor and integ-
</p>
<p>rity of the historian be impeached, save by this systematic
</p>
<p>suppression of testimony, by this concealment of truth,

<p>A.
</p>
<p>LETTER OP THOMAS GREEN TO THE GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA.
</p>
<p>Louisville, Falls of Ohio, Dec. 22, 1786.
</p>
<p>Honored and Respected Sir :  Since I had the pleasure of writing my
</p>
<p>last, many circumstances of alarming nature have turned up to view. The
</p>
<p>commercial treaty with Spain is considered to be cruel, oppressive, .and
</p>
<p>unjust. The prohibition of the navigation of the Mississippi, has aston-
</p>
<p>ished the whole western country. To sell us and make us vassals of the
</p>
<p>merciless Sjjaniards, is a grievance not to be borne. Should we tamely
</p>
<p>submit to such manacles, we should be unworthy the name of Ameri-
</p>
<p>cans, and a scandal to the annals of its history. It is very surprising to
</p>
<p>every rational person that the legislature of the United States, which
</p>
<p>has been so applauded for its assertion and defense of their rights and
</p>
<p>privileges, should so soon endeavor to subjugate the greatest part of
</p>
<p>their dominion even to worse slavery than ever Great Britain presumed to
</p>
<p>subjugate any part of hers. Ireland is a free country to what this will
</p>
<p>be when its navigation is entirely shut. We may as well be sold for
</p>
<p>bondsmen as to have the Spaniards share all the benefits of our toils.
</p>
<p>They" will receive all the fruits, produce of this large, rich, and fertile
</p>
<p>country, at their own prices, (which you may be assured will be very
</p>
<p>low) and, therefore, will be able to supply their own markets, and all the
</p>
<p>markets of Europe, on much lower terms than what the Americans pos-
</p>
<p>sibly can. What then, are the advantages that the inhabitants of the
</p>
<p>Atlantic shores are to receive ? This is summed up in a very few
</p>
<p>words : their trade and navigation ruined, and their brethren laboring
</p>
<p>to enrich a luxurious, merciless, and arbitrary nation. Too much of our
</p>
<p>property have they already seized, condemned, and confiscated, testi-
</p>
<p>monies of which I send you, accompanying this.
</p>
<p>Our situation can not possibly be worse ; therefore, every exertion to
</p>
<p>retrieve our circumstances must be manly, eligible, and just. The
</p>
<p>minds of the people here are very much exasperated against both the
</p>
<p>Spaniards and Congress. But they are happy to hear that the state of
</p>
<p>Georgia has protested against such vile proceedings: therefore they
</p>
<p>have some hopes, look up to that state, craving to be protected in our

<p>just rights and privileges.
</p>
<p>" Matters here seem to wear a threatening aspect. The troops sta-
</p>

</p>
<p>have seized upon what Spanish property there was at that place, also at
</p>
<p>the Illinois, in retaliation for their many offenses. General Clark, who
</p>
<p>has fought so gloriously for his country, and whose name strikes all the
</p>
<p>western savages with terror, together with many other gentlemen of
</p>
<p>merit, engages to raise troops sufficient, and go with me to the Natchez
</p>
<p>to take possession, and settle the lands agreeable to the lines of that
</p>
<p>state, at their own risk and expense ; provided you in your infinite good-
</p>
<p>ness, will countenance them and give us the land to settle it agreeable
</p>
<p>to the laws of your state. Hundreds are now waiting to join us with
</p>
<p>their families, seeking asylum for liberty and religion. Not hearing
</p>
<p>that the lines are settled between you anil the Spaniards, we therefore
</p>
<p>wish for your directions concerning them, and the advice of your supe-
</p>
<p>rior wisdom. At the same time assuring you that we have contracted
</p>
<p>for a very large quantity of goods, we hope sufficient to supply all the
</p>
<p>Indians living within the limits of Georgia. Trusting that we shall be
</p>
<p>able ,to make them independent of the Spaniards, wean their affections,
</p>
<p>and procure their esteem for us and the United States, as we expect to
</p>
<p>take the goods down with us. We earnestly pray that you would give
</p>
<p>us full liberty to trade with all those tribes, and also to give your agents
</p>
<p>for Indian Affairs all the necessary instructions for the prosperity of our
</p>
<p>scheme. The season for the Indian trade will be so far advanced that I
</p>
<p>wait with very great impatience.
</p>
<p>" General Clark, together with a number of other gentlemen will be
</p>
<p>ready to proceed down the river with me, on the shortest notice ; there-
</p>
<p>fore I hope and earnestly pray that you will dispatch the express back
</p>
<p>with all possible speed with your answer, and all the encouragement due
</p>
<p>to so great an undertaking. As to the further particulars, I refer you to
</p>
<p>the bearer, Mr. William Wells, a gentleman of merit, who will be able
</p>
<p>to inform you more minutely than I possibly can of the sentiments of
</p>
<p>the people of this western country.
</p>
<p>Sir, I have the honor to be your honor's etc.,

<p>Appendix. 887
</p>
<p>CIRCULAR, PROBABLY WRITTEN BY THOMAS GREEN.
</p>
<p>During tlie winter of 1786-7, copies of the following production
</p>
<p>were circulated with an air of secrecy, among some of the Ameri-
</p>
<p>can settlements on the western side of the Alleghany mountains;
</p>
<p>particularly in Kentucky and Tennessee.
</p>
<p>" A COPY OF A LETTER FROM A GENTLEMAN AT THE FALLS OF
</p>
<p>OHIO, TO HIS FRIEND IN NEM' ENGLAND, DATED DECEMBER 4,
</p>
<p>1786."
</p>
<p>" Dear Sir:  Politics, which a few months ago were scarcely thought
</p>
<p>of, are now sounded aloud in this part of the world, and discussed hy
</p>
<p>almost every person. The late commercial treaty with Spain, in shut-
</p>
<p>ting up, as it is said, the navigation of the Mississippi for the term of
</p>
<p>twenty-five years, has given this western country a universal shock,
</p>
<p>and struck its inhabitants with an amazement. Our foundation is
</p>
<p>affected. It is therefore necessary that every individual exert himself
</p>
<p>to apply a remedy. To sell us, and make us vassals to the merciless
</p>
<p>Spaniards, is a grievance not to be borne.
</p>
<p>The parliamentary acts which occasioned our revolt from Great
</p>
<p>Britain were not so barefaced and intolerable. To give us the liberty
</p>
<p>of transporting our ett'ects down the river to New Orleans, and then be
</p>
<p>subject to the Spanish laws and impositions, is an insult upon our un-
</p>
<p>derstanding. We know by woeful experience, that it is in their power,
</p>
<p>when once there, to take our produce at any price they please. Large
</p>
<p>quantities of flour, tobacco, meal, etc., have been taken there the last
</p>
<p>summer, and mostly confiscated. They who had permits from their
</p>
<p>governor, were obliged to sell at a price he was pleased to state, or sub-
</p>
<p>ject themselves to lose the whole. Men of large property are already
</p>
<p>ruined by their policy. What benefit can j'ou on the Atlantic shores
</p>
<p>receive from this act ? The Si3aniards, frofai the amazing resources of
</p>
<p>this river, can supply all their own markets at a much lower price than
</p>
<p>you possibly can.
</p>
<p>Though this country has been settling but about six years and that in
</p>
<p>the midst of an inveterate enemy, and most of the first adventurers
</p>
<p>fallen a prey to the savages, and although the emigration to this country
</p>

</p>
<p>is 80 very rapid that the internal market is very great, yet the quantities
</p>
<p>of produce they now have on hand are immense. Flour and pork are
</p>
<p>now selling here at twelve shillings the hundred ; beef in proportion ;
</p>
<p>any quantities of Indian corn can be had at nine pence per bushel.
</p>
<p>388 Appendix.
</p>
<p>Three times the quantity of tobacco and corn can be raised on an acre
</p>
<p>here that can be within the settlement on the east side of the moun-
</p>
<p>tains, and with less cultivation. It is therefore rational to suppose that
</p>
<p>in a'very few years the vast bodies of waters in those rivers will labor
</p>
<p>under immense weight of the produce of this rich and fertile country,
</p>
<p>and the Spanish ships be unable to convey it to market.
</p>
<p>" Do you think to prevent the emigration from a barren country,
</p>
<p>loaded wdth taxes, and impoverished with debts, to the most Inxurious
</p>
<p>and fertile soil in the world ? Vain is the thought, and presumptuous the
</p>
<p>supposition. You may as well endeavor to prevent the fishes from
</p>
<p>gathering on a bank in the sea, wliich affords them plenty of nourish-
</p>
<p>ment. Shall the best and largest part of the United States be unculti-
</p>
<p>vateda nest for savages and beasts of prey ? Certainly not. Provi-
</p>
<p>dence has designed it for nobler purposes. This is convincing to every
</p>
<p>one who beholds the many advantages and pleasing prospects of this
</p>
<p>country. Here is a soil, richer to appearance than can possibly be made
</p>
<p>by art. Large plains and meadows without the labor of hands, suffi-
</p>
<p>cient to support millions of cattle, summer and winter ; cane, which is
</p>
<p>also a fine nourishment for them, without bounds. The spontaneous
</p>
<p>production of this country surpasses your imagination. Consequently,
</p>
<p>I see nothing to prevent our herds being as numerous here in time as
</p>
<p>they are in the kingdom of Mexico. Our lands to the northward of the
</p>
<p>Ohio, for the produce of wheat, etc., will, I think, vie with the island of
</p>
<p>^Sicily. Shall all this country now be cultivated for the use of the Span-
</p>
<p>iards ? Shall we be their bondmen, as the children of Israel were to the
</p>
<p>Egyptians? Shall one part of the United States be slaves, while the
</p>
<p>other is free? Human nature shudders at the thought, and free men
</p>
<p>will despise those who could be so mean as to even contemplate on so
</p>
<p>vile a subject.
</p>
<p>" Our situation is as bad as it possibly cau be ; therefore every exer-
</p>
<p>tion to retrieve our circumstances must be manly, eligible, and just.
</p>
<p>We can raise twenty thousand troops on this side the Allegheny and
</p>
<p>Appalachian mountains: and the annual increase of them by emigra-
</p>
<p>tion, from other parts is from two to four thousand.

<p>" We have taken all the goods belonging to the Spanish merchants of
</p>
<p>Post Vincennes and the Illinois, and are determined they shall not trade
</p>
<p>up the river, provided they will not let us trade down it. Preparations
</p>
<p>are now making here {if necessary) to drive the Spaniards from their settlement,
</p>
<p>at the mouth of the Mississippi. In case we are not countenanced and succored
</p>
<p>by the United States {if we need it) our allegiance will be throvm off, and some
</p>
<p>other power applied to. Great Britain stands ready, with open arms, to receive
</p>
<p>and support us. They have already offered to open their resources for our sup-
</p>
<p>plies. When once re-united to them, " farewell, a long farewell to all your
</p>
<p>boasted greatness. The province of Canada, and the inhabitants of
</p>
<p>these waters of themselves, in time, will be able to conquer you. You
</p>
<p>are as ignorant of this country as Great Britain was of America. These
</p>
<p>hints, if rightly improved, may be of some service ; if not, blame your-
</p>
<p>selves for the neglect,"

<p>such a project could never receive their approbation or even their

<p>to themselves and their Constituents to be vigilant over their interests

<p>and guard them, especially in a point of such importance to their very

<p>existence, they consider it their duty to express their uneasiness at this

<p>report, and to make known to the Legislature their apprehensions of
</p>
<p>the evils which much necessarily result from so unconstitutional and
</p>
<p>dangerous a measure, should it take effect, that they may in their wis-

<p>gation of the River.
</p>
<p>Your Memorialists beg leave to observe that they are thrown into the
</p>
<p>utmost consternation & distress by this report. Inhabiting the Counties
</p>
<p>which border on the Western Waters, their prosperity & welfare and
</p>
<p>that of their Constituents must principally depend on the navigation of
</p>
<p>this River. Nature hath thrown so many ditficulties in the way that it
</p>
<p>will be in a manner impossible for their product to find a Market thro'
</p>
<p>390 , Appendix.
</p>
<p>any other Channel. This project therefore presents to them the melan-
</p>
<p>choly prospect of ruiu to themselves and their families. Born and edu-
</p>
<p>cated under our common gov't and attached to it by the strongest Ties
</p>
<p>of Interest & affection, having equally participated in the hardships &
</p>
<p>dangers of the Revolution and being equally entitled to its benefits,
</p>
<p>they cannot but receive with horror the Idea of their being thus sacri-
</p>
<p>ficed, and their interests sold by those whom they have considered as
</p>
<p>their brethren, friends & fellow-citizens. They have heretofore been
</p>
<p>surprised to hear that even Hpain should be opposed to their use of this
</p>
<p>River, and have hoped that the wise & benevolent Councils of that
</p>
<p>Court would perceive its injustice and impolicy, and give over the oppo-
</p>
<p>sition. With patience and submission they have waited the success of
</p>
<p>tliose measures which Congress might take to obtain this important end,
</p>
<p>in full confidence that under a wise arrangement an amicable accomoda-
</p>
<p>tion might soon be made to that effect. But how great must their con-
</p>
<p>cern & astonishment be, if the Citizens of the Western Country find
</p>
<p>that they are to be deprived of those benefits, not by the mistaken
</p>
<p>policy of Spain, but by the Government to which they belong, and to
</p>
<p>whose protection and support, by the common principles of the federal
</p>
<p>compact, they are entitled.
</p>
<p>Your Memorialists are unacquainted with the merits of the commer-
</p>
<p>cial part of this project and therefore cannot determine how far it might
</p>
<p>be beneficial upon those principles alone ; but they do not consider that,
</p>
<p>as a circumstance that should be taken into view in contemplation of
</p>
<p>the surrender proposed ; for no considerations of advantage, however
</p>
<p>great they might be, could justify the U. S. for the violation of the fed-
</p>
<p>eral compact, which this unquestionedly would be.
</p>
<p>The Citizens of these Counties have "the same right to the navigation
</p>
<p>of this river which they have to that of the James or Patowmick ; they
</p>
<p>derive it from nature, from the principles of the revolution, and from
</p>
<p>the treaty with Great Britain ; the same high sources from whence they
</p>
<p>have those rights of government and religion they now enjoy for the
</p>
<p>protection and security of which the Confederacy was formed, and with
</p>
<p>the same propriety might Congress Barter away their right to the tryal

<p>by jury or alien a County or a State for advantages in trade as occlude
</p>
<p>the Mississippi. Treaties of commerce have heretofore been formed
</p>
<p>even between tlie most despotic powers for reciprocal advantages in the
</p>
<p>commercial intercourse between their respective subjects & Dominions,
</p>
<p>but never have they before heard of a project being proposed, much
</p>
<p>less a treaty formed which shut the Doors of Commerce to one_ part of
</p>
<p>a community and deprived it of its natural rights for the benefit of the
</p>
<p>other; how subversive & abhorrent therefore must such a project be to
</p>
<p>the mild and free spirit of our federal constitution ; formed on equal
</p>
<p>principles for common good. The confidence your memorialists have in
</p>
<p>the justice and magnanimity of Congress inclines them to hope that the
</p>
<p>report rt_'S])cctiiiu- tills [n-oji'ct is withiuit foundation, but as they do in
</p>
<p>their Conscii'-irrs hrlifN'-' that if it shall b.' adopted it will produce the
</p>
<p>most ruinous and destiuctive coiiscciuciices, not only to them and their
</p>
<p>constituents, but to the general interest of the federal government, they
</p>
<p>have thought it their duty to make known to the legislature their Sen-
</p>
<p>timents on the subject. Tiie decision of the State upon the present
</p>
<p>occasion upon this point, even if the report should be groundless, may
</p>
<p>be of service in the negotiation, and contribute to bring it to a fortunate
</p>
<p>close.
</p>
<p>That the General A,ssembly may take those measures which shall be
</p>
<p>Appemdix.
</p>
<p>391
</p>
<p>the best calculated to obtain this important end, and preserve at the
</p>
<p>same time the harmony & general interests of the Confederacy is the
</p>
<p>sincere desire of vour Memorialists.
