</p>
<p>THE MEMORABLE
</p>
<p>BLOOD CONSPIRACY, &c.
</p>
<p>RIGHT Reverend Prelate once informed the good people of
</p>
<p>this country, that they had nothing to do with the laws but to obey
</p>
<p>them ; and many genteel persons are so favourable to the doctrine,
</p>
<p>that they are scandalised at every expression of honest indignation
</p>
<p>excited by some notable proof of their impolicy, partiality, or in-
</p>
<p>justice. The indulgence claimed for the laws, too, must be ex-
</p>
<p>tended to their administrators; and we are gravely called upon, not
</p>
<p>only to make the usual allowances for human infirmity, bnt abso-
</p>
<p>lutely to forego that vigilance and exposure of abuses, without
</p>
<p>which laws would soon become the mere discretion of the magistracy.
</p>
<p>Now, with ail due respect to the powers that be, it may be con-
</p>
<p>tended that almost every improvement, both in theory and practice^
</p>
<p>has original ed in this country f torn EXTRA-OFFICIAL interference i
</p>
<p>and that public opinion, freely but decently expressed, is as essen-
</p>
<p>tial to the regulation of the magistrate as the criminal. All the
</p>
<p>world knows what implicit confidence engenders in this respect, and
</p>
<p>how round and voluble the exclamation of "All's well" is re-
</p>
<p>echoed from one worshipful quarter to another, until humane and
</p>
<p>public-spirited individuals penetrate into the painted sepulchre, and
</p>
<p>draw forth the rottenness and bones. Away, then, with this trust
</p>
<p>and this apathy, which cannot be afforded to any body of men. If an
</p>
<p>administrator of criminal law be seen presiding over a case of life
</p>
<p>and death with the spirit of a rat-catcher, acting as counsel, nay as
</p>
<p>a friend, to the prosecutors ; and if, disregarding the light and
</p>
<p>shade of circumstance, a human being should be hurried out of
</p>
<p>the world whose guilt is more than doubtful, let not " respectable
</p>
<p>persons" stifle their genuine feelings, and exclaim " It is a sad
</p>
<p>thing, to be sure ; but the individual is hanged now, and if we
</p>
<p>meddle it will only unsettle the minds of the lower orders."

</p>
<p>J.oirer orders ! it would be dim' cult to discover an order lower
</p>
<p>than that which contains minds to whom urh abuses are indif-
</p>
<p>ferent.
</p>
<p>The title of these sheets will naturally lead the intelligent reader
</p>
<p>to the immediate cause of the foregoing observations. He will
</p>
<p>perceive that they are suggested by the recent discovery of the ne-
</p>
<p>farious proceedings of certain retainers of the police; the publicity
</p>
<p>of which is another awkward particular for the philanthropists whose
</p>
<p>sympathy evaporates in " Dear me ! a sad thing, indeed !" &c. &c.
</p>
<p>If this abominable iniquity were new to the country, or one of those
</p>
<p>isolated instances of human depravity which now and then arise to
</p>
<p>disturb the settled conceptions of society, it would afford little
</p>
<p>room for observation ; but such is not the fact. Almost every one
</p>
<p>has heard of Jonathan Wild, and seen the Beggar's Opera : Jona-
</p>
<p>than, by polite people, is doubtless put upon the shelf with Nero,
</p>
<p>as an impossible repetition in these humane and civilised times, and
</p>
<p>the Beggar's Opera laughed at as a joke. Be it known, therefore,
</p>
<p>to the worthy souls who so pique themselves upon superior national
</p>
<p>morality, that English Jonathans exist in this said year 1816; and
</p>
<p>that the Beggar's Opera, which was only a slight caricature of the
</p>
<p>abuses of the day in which it was written, is not wholly pointless at
</p>
<p>present. Be it known, also, that in the year 1 756 a similar disco-
</p>
<p>very of conspiracy, murder, and perjury, for reward, was discovered
</p>
<p>among the attendants of justice, as at present; and hence the
</p>
<p>scandal of persevering in a system so calculated to confirm guilt and
</p>
<p>ensnare innocence as that of blood-money, which is a premium for
</p>
<p>the cultivation of petty criminality into the high or rewardable.
</p>
<p>The extreme licence given to the men whose interest it is to con-
</p>
<p>vict, cannot be too much decried; and the preference with which
</p>
<p>their bare unsupported testimony is frequently received, is a perfect
</p>
<p>anomaly to the doctrine laid down in other cases. What may be
</p>
<p>we learn by what is discovered; but how frequently innocence has
</p>
<p>suffered, dishonesty been tempted, and justice deluded, we know
</p>
<p>not. Of this we are certain, that in 1756 a system of horrible
</p>
<p>treachery, conspiracy, and murder, took place, which is repeated in
</p>
<p>18 16, with permission, and with such a nicety of resemblance that,
</p>
<p>as far as the examinations have hitherto proceeded, the one may be
</p>
<p>considered an echo to the other. It is this resemblance which

</p>
<p>suggests the present account of the thief-takers, MACDANIEL,
</p>
<p>BERRY, SALMON, and EGAN. To display the results of a like
</p>
<p>discovery many years ago, may tend to enlighten the public on
</p>
<p>the subject of such crying evils. It may do more it may shew
</p>
<p>that a system, which from time to time has produced such monstrous
</p>
<p>iniquity, is radically defective, and, in this sense, assist a noble-
</p>
<p>minded individual (Sir Samuel Romilly) in his ill-repaid labours.
</p>
<p>There is also a Police Committee of the House of Commons exist-
</p>
<p>ing, to whom the account, accompanied with a little brief annota-
</p>
<p>tion, suggested by the striking coincidences of the present day, may
</p>
<p>be welcome. An account published at that period, from which
</p>
<p>several of the ensuing facts have been extracted, opens with coarse,
</p>
<p>but honest and even eloquent, simplicity, as follows:
</p>
<p>HISTORY of the THIEF-TAKERS,
</p>
<p>STEPHEN MACDANIEL, JOHN BERRY, JAMES GAHA-
</p>
<p>GAN, OTHERWISE EGAN, AND JAMES SALMON.
</p>
<p>NEVER was wjckedness carried to so monstrous a height, or so
</p>
<p>long escaped with impunity, as the horrible villainies of these
</p>
<p>miscreants, whose history we here offer to the public view. Nor
</p>
<p>can the records of any nation upon earth, how barbarous and sa-
</p>
<p>vage soever they may be represented, furnish such a continued series
</p>
<p>of inhuman and unprovoked cruelties and murders, executed by
</p>
<p>any set of men, as have been perpetrated by these incarnate demons,
</p>
<p>under the mask of doing public justice : nay, it may be truly af-
</p>
<p>firmed, that, were we to search the journals of the OLD BAILEY
</p>
<p>for an hundred years past, we shall not mid their equals in relentless
</p>
<p>cruelty.* They made no scruple of sacrificing the lives of a great
</p>
<p>number of innocent persons, with no other view than to get money;
</p>
<p>and, as an aggravation of their crimes, they always added perjury to
</p>
<p>murder. They laid snares for the unwary, forged robberies for
</p>
<p>those who were never guilty of them, and fixed them in open court,
</p>
<p>by the most solemn appeal to God, when, at the same moment,
</p>
<p>their consciences told them that every fact they swore to was abso-
</p>
<p>lutely false. And so artfully were their iniquitous schemes con-
</p>
<p>trived, that it was almost impossible for the person whom they
</p>
<p>doomed to the slaughter to escape the snare. They had their ter-
</p>
<p>riers to start the game, while tins pack of bloodhounds were watch-
</p>
<p>ing to devour it. They always had their under-agents to seek out
</p>
<p>the object for a victim, which they themselves undertook to butcher
</p>
<p>at the altar.
</p>
<p>Nor was London the only stage on which they exhibited their
</p>
<p>barbarous practices ; for they were frequently seen at assizes in se-
</p>
<p>veral parts of the country, pursuing the same hellish designs of
</p>
<p>swearing innocent people out of their lives for the reward.
</p>
<p>For twenty years and upwards had these blood-suckers been
</p>
<p>preying upon the lives of poor heedless creatures, who had beert
</p>
<p>griped to death by their merciless talons. Scarce a sessions was held
</p>
<p>at the Old Bailey for many years before, but some unhappy wretch

</p>
<p>liad been sacrificed to their cruel avarice. And so hardened, so lost
</p>
<p>to all sense of humanity, compassion, and remorse, were these
</p>
<p>* Is this an anti-climax? if so, it is excusable while contemplating a
</p>
<p>ease like that which it introduces. It is pleasant to read the observations
</p>
<p>of certain high-toned journalists upon the demoralization of a neighbouring
</p>
<p>country let them look at home. If a conspiracy resembling the recent
</p>
<p>discovery had transpired in France, with what remarks should we not have
</p>
<p>been edified. The mischief would instantly be traced in a right line to
</p>
<p>Rousseau and Voltaire, whose horrible volumes, some sapient private
</p>
<p>letter-writer would assure us, held a conspicuous station on the book-shelyes
</p>
<p>flf the Parisian Mr, Vaughan.
</p>
<p>6
</p>
<p>abandoned villains, that, upon sharing the reward on the conviction
</p>
<p>of any criminal, whom their perjuries had made so, they always
</p>
<p>had an entertainment, which they very justly called the Blood-
</p>
<p>Feast ; at the conclusion of which they concerted measures for
</p>
<p>their next enterprise, and consulted for pitching upon the unfortunate
</p>
<p>wretch who was to be the new object of their sanguinary prosecu-
</p>
<p>tion, and accordingly gave directions to their indefatigable agents,
</p>
<p>who never failed to bring in the prey they were ordered to hunt for.
</p>
<p>So frolicsome were they on these occasions, that, if any one of them
</p>
<p>happened to miscarry in the prosecution, he was sure to be the
</p>
<p>jest and banter of the whole company.
</p>
<p>In 1740, John Berry enticed LYON ALEXANDER, a poor Jew
</p>
<p>boy, into a house, where were Currant, Deadman, and Unwin,
</p>
<p>all thief-takers, under pretence of giving him a shilling to carry a
</p>
<p>bundle. They spirited him off to Greenwich as a runaway seaman;
</p>
<p>they beat him with their sticks, and broke his fingers ; they then
</p>
<p>gave him in charge to a constable as a footpad, carried him before
</p>
<p>a magistrate, and Berry and Deadman swore to being robbed by
</p>
<p>him, and Unwin and Currant that he had been an evidence at the
</p>
<p>Old Bailey, and hanged five or six people. The unfortunate Jew
</p>
<p>lad was committed to Maidstone gaol for trial, about a week before
</p>
<p>the assizes ; but, having friends who employed a lawyer in his de-
</p>
<p>fence, Berry and his gang never appeared to support the indictment
</p>
<p>they preferred against him, and one PRITCHARD (whom they had
</p>
<p>previously got committed, but ran away) ; and Alexander and Prit-
</p>
<p>chard, an equally innocent lad, entrapped by the wretches in the
</p>
<p>same way, were cleared. Alexander's friends happening to say in a
</p>
<p>tavern at Rochester that they would give 501. to have the villains
</p>
<p>apprehended, a kinsman of Un win's undertook to effect it, and
</p>
<p>Berry was actually taken, arraigned, pleaded guilty, fined, and im-
</p>
<p>prisoned. Unwiu's friends compromised for 201. ; Currant was
</p>
<p>taken, but escaped out of a coach, and was never afterwards heard
</p>
<p>of; and Deadman was never taken, though often attempted, always
</p>
<p>going armed : he once shot at his pursuers, afterwards commuted a

</p>
<p>highway robbery, was taken for that at Oxford, lodged in gaol
</p>
<p>there, and, attempting to escape by murdering the keeper, was
</p>
<p>himself killed.
</p>
<p>In 1744, STOCKDALE and JOHNSON robbed and murdered the
</p>
<p>penny-postman at Enfield, and were tried for it, and hung in chains
</p>
<p>near the spot ; shortly afterwards two letters were written to the
</p>
<p>Earl of Leicester, one of the postmasters general, threatening him
</p>
<p>with fire and sword if the bodies were not taken down. The Earl
</p>
<p>offered 5001. to any person discovering the writer of the letters,
</p>
<p>copies of which were published in the advertisement. John Berry,
</p>
<p>one of the gang, afterwards detected, wrote copies of the letters with
</p>
<p>a design of slipping them into the pocket of some person of bad
</p>
<p>character, and then, by having a constable ready to search him, and
</p>
<p>I he letters being found upon him, witnesses were to be produced to
</p>
<p>swear they were his hand-writing ; and thus Berry was to become
</p>
<p>Entitled to the 5001. reward. The plan, however, was not executed;
</p>
<p>but it was believed at the time that Berry was the author of the
</p>
<p>original letters, in expectation of a large reward being oftered, to
</p>
<p>give him an opportunity of convicting an innocent person.
</p>
<p>Some years afterwards, James Gahagan, otherwise Egan, another
</p>
<p>of the conspirators, prosecuted a young fellow for robbing him in
</p>
<p>the fields. At the trial, he first swore he was asleep under a hay-
</p>
<p>cock ; but, being furtlier examined by the court, he declared he
</p>
<p>was walking in the fields. On so manifest a contradiction, the
</p>
<p>prisoner was acquitted. This was a large field for Stephen Mac-
</p>
<p>daniel, another blood-money man, to play upon Egan, and he did
</p>
<p>not spare to rally him sufficiently for his awkward and ridiculous
</p>
<p>management; telling him lhat, when he himself prosecuted, he al-
</p>
<p>ways made, sure woi'fc of it*
</p>
<p>It were easy to fill a large volume with accounts of the horrid
</p>
<p>schemes and diabolical practices of these monsters of human na-
</p>
<p>ture ; but we choose to confine our history to the time \vhen thief-
</p>
<p>taking was followed as a trade, and when these execrable wretches
</p>
<p>4>egan to be supported and encouraged by some magistrates, who,
</p>
<p>it may reasonably be presumed, profited by their labours ; since, in
</p>
<p>public advertisements, they had not been ashamed to call them
</p>
<p>-very honest fcltotvs, and men who hazarded their lives for the sake
</p>
<p>of their country. f
</p>
<p>Macdaniel had been a highwayman, and was taken with his com-
</p>
<p>panion, whom he became King's evidence against, and hanged.
</p>
<p>He was afterwards a Marshalsea-court officer and professed thief-
</p>
<p>taker. In 1?50, he prosecuted THOMAS DUNKIN and EDWARD
</p>

<p>2s. 2d. in money, and shooting at him ; but a man who was with
</p>
<p>Macdaniel at the time swore that the prisoners were not the men,
</p>
<p>but that, coming by shortly after the robbery, Macdaniel seized
</p>
<p>them. They were acquitted, aud Macdaniel lost the blood-money.
</p>
<p>The first enterprise we shall detail, in which Macdaniel, Berry,

<p>James Salmon, and Egan, were engaged, was in the year 1/51. It

<p>young lads, whom they had singled out as very proper objects for
</p>
<p>their purpose.
</p>
<p>William Newman and James March were indicted for that they,
</p>
<p>in a certain passage or open place near the King's highway, ou
</p>
<p>James Daniel did make an assault, and steal from his person oue haf,
</p>
<p>value 1. 6'd. one silk handkerchief, one pair of leather shoes, one
</p>
<p>penknife, and Is. 6d. in money, on September 2d, 1750. This was
</p>
<p>* The same elegant raillery appears to have mingled in the conversation
</p>
<p>/of the conspirators of 1816.
</p>
<p>t Times are not materially altered in this respect ; we may all recollect
</p>
<p>instances of magisterial protection quite as disinterested and judicious.
</p>
<p>We know that, in spite of notorious fact, an important prison was long
</p>
<p>left under the suprimeridaace of an individual who merited one of its
</p>
<p>cells, Whj?
</p>
<p>the crime charged in the indictment, but had no foundation i
</p>
<p>truth or fact. The scheme was artfully contrived by Macdaniel,
</p>
<p>Berry, Salmon, and Egan, in order to take away the lives of these
</p>
<p>two silly youths, whose follies and bad conduct they knew had ren-
</p>
<p>dered them fit for their purpose : however, as they did not think
</p>
<p>proper to appear themselves as witnesses, it was judged necessary to
</p>
<p>list some others into the service, to do the dirty work for them, for
</p>
<p>which they were promised an equal share in the reward. Pursuant
</p>
<p>to this plan of operation, they procured one James Daniel to be
</p>
<p>the person who was to be robbed ; Timothy Brads was to corrqbcv
</p>
<p>rate Daniel's evidence, by swearing he was in the prisoners' company
</p>
<p>when the robbery was committed ; and Woodward Harlow, a thief-'
</p>
<p>taker , was to be the person to seize them.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, when the trial came on, James Daniel swore posi-
</p>
<p>tively that, on the day laid in the indictment, he had been witli a
</p>
<p>young fellow part of the way to Coventry, and on his return home
</p>
<p>called at the Two Brewers ait Hockley-in-lhe-Hole, where he drank
</p>
<p>a pint of beer. Coming out into -the street, he saw three men
</p>
<p>standing by a lamp, two of them had hats and the other a cap.
</p>
<p>They crossed over to them, and one of them laid hold of his collar,
</p>
<p>and swore he would knock his brains out if he stirred ; and the
</p>
<p>other took off his hat, and put it on March's head. Then Newman
</p>
<p>put his hand in his pocket, and took out one shilling and sixpence.
</p>
<p>They took from him likewise a penknife and a handkerchief, in
</p>
<p>which was tied up a pair of shoes. They then ran away, and he
</p>
<p>went on.
</p>
<p>Timothy Brads, who was the instrument which the gang made
</p>
<p>use of to decoy Newman and March into a robbery, did for that
</p>
<p>end make himself a party with them ; but, to prevent his being
</p>
<p>involved in the same fate, these demons we are treating of took care
</p>
<p>to have him admitted an evidence. Accordingly, he swore on the
</p>
<p>trial that he and the two prisoners went out together with the fuU
</p>
<p>intent to rob ; and, coming up with the prosecutor on Saffron-hill,
</p>
<p>he followed them into George-yard, and with the help of the two
</p>
<p>prisoners robbed him of the things above-mentioned, which they

</p>
<p>divided among them.
</p>
<p>A robbery being thus plainly proved by positive evidence, the
</p>
<p>falsity of which it was impossible either for the prisoners to make
</p>
<p>appear or the court and jury to detect, they were both found Guilty
</p>
<p>Death.
</p>
<p>Newman, in the confession he made a little before his execution,
</p>
<p>said he was near twenty-one years of age, and born in St. Giles's
</p>
<p>in the Fields; and that, as to the fact for which he suffered, it was
</p>
<p>a scheme laid to take away his life for the sake of the reward : that
</p>
<p>indeed he and Brads did go out together, and wandered they scarce
</p>
<p>knew where, but happened to stumble into George-yard, where
</p>
<p>they saw a man sleeping in a cart, from whom he owned the things
</p>
<p>were taken ; but they went off, and left the man as fast asleep as
</p>
<p>they found him. From hence he concluded that it was the desigu
</p>
<p>of Brads to ensnare him and March, because, as soon as they left
</p>
<p>the man, Brads went away, and he saw him no more till he was
</p>
<p>apprehended by the thief-taker, who was directed by Brads where
</p>
<p>to rind him.* March was but 1 7 years old, had no education, and was
</p>
<p>apprenticed to a waterman, whose service he quitted to associate with
</p>
<p>all the idle vagabond boys he could meet with ; which at length
</p>
<p>proved his ruin. He was ignorant almost to stupidity, and there-
</p>
<p>fore it was no wonder he said nothing. Nor is it at all surprising
</p>
<p>that these two poor unhappy creatures should fall into the snare so
</p>
<p>artfully prepared for them by the villainous intrigues of this rapa-
</p>
<p>cious and bloody gang. Harlow, who had been let into a share in the
</p>
<p>blood-monev, refused to allow Mac Daniel any part of it, because
</p>
<p>he tlid not mount that is, appear on the trial as an evidence ; but
</p>
<p>Mac Daniel arrested Harlow, who, afraid of the story coming out,
</p>
<p>gave Mac Daniel forty pounds to compromise the matter.f
</p>
<p>James Daniel died soon after, and, with great anguish of mind,
</p>
<p>confessed that the boys were innocent.
</p>
<p>The gang now took into their service Thomas Blee, the future
</p>
<p>evidence against themselves, and consulted with him to find out a
</p>
<p>fit man for their purpose, who was poor and destitute ;| accord-
</p>
<p>ingly he met one CHRISTOPHER WOODLAND, to whom he gave
</p>
<p>a dram, and soon got acquainted with him. The scheme laid to
</p>
<p>entrap him was contrived in this manner : Egan was to take the
</p>
<p>lower part of Berry's house on Saffron-hill, which he did, and some
</p>
<p>goods were to be borrowed of Mrs. Jones the broker; Tom Blee
</p>
<p>was to engage Woodland to assist him in breaking open the house
</p>
<p>and taking the goods; Woodland was to be seized, and Blee
</p>
<p>escape.
</p>
<p>Blee and Woodland went together ; Blee took off the padlock,
</p>
<p>vvhicli he had been concerned in putting on, and brought out the
</p>
<p>things in a bag left there on purpose, and gave them to Woodland
</p>
<p>to carry off: it was concerted that the goods should be carried to
</p>
<p>* Brads was a tailor's apprentice, inveigled by a promise of an equal
</p>
<p>share in the reward, which amounted to 2801.! and which the gang received.
</p>
<p>They gave him only nine shillings; and he, with a most rational appre-

<p>at a loss, sold himself to the American plantations.
</p>
<p>r Macdaniel was more successful than his companion Harlow; for John
</p>
<p>Simmons, alias Spanish Jack, who was executed at Maidstone in April
</p>
<p>1756, there confessed that he had had dealings with the thief-takers then
</p>
<p>in Newgate, as well as with those at liberty ; and declared that, in Sep.
</p>
<p>tember 1751, at the instigation of Macdaniel and others, he enticed WM.
</p>
<p>HOLMES, JOHN NEWTON, and FRANCIS MANDEVILLE, to commit a rob-
</p>
<p>bery in Whitechapel, who were apprehended by ihe gang, tried, and exe-
</p>
<p>cuted at Tyburn, he being admitted an evidence; and further, that they
</p>
<p>had 4201. reward, but that they got only 101., Macdaniel cheating him of
</p>
<p>the rest of his share !
</p>
<p>% Poor and destitute ! Go to Newgate, reader; or, if now happily too

<p>late, enquire after the poverty and destitution of the three unfortunate

</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones's, from whence they came, which was done that night;
</p>
<p>end, after bargaining for them, she gave them a shilling in part, and
</p>
<p>they were to call the next day for the rest.
</p>
<p>This scheme was pursued in every particular, and Woodland was
</p>
<p>seized the next day, and brought to his trial, and indicted for that
</p>
<p>lie, on the 3d of December, about the hour of nine at night, the
</p>
<p>dwelling-house of James Egan did break and enter, three linen
</p>
<p>Bhirts, value 4s. one pair of blankets, value 5s. one linen counter*
</p>
<p>pane, two smoothing-irons, four candlesticks, four plates, and a
</p>
<p>pair of metal shoe-buckles, the goods of the said James, in the said
</p>
<p>dwelling-house, did steal, take, and carry away.
</p>
<p>In order to prove the fact charged in the indictment, Egan swore
</p>
<p>that about eight o'clock at night of the day above-mentioned he
</p>
<p>went out, and, coming in a little before ten, he found the padlock
</p>
<p>taken from off from the door, and the stock-lock broke ; that his
</p>
<p>.house was fast before he went out ; that he found a strong chissel in
</p>
<p>the house, with which he supposed it was broke open. Upon his
</p>
<p>missing the things, and talking of it publicly, one Mrs. Jones, who
</p>
<p>keeps a broker's shop in Broker's-alley, sent to him the next day to
</p>
<p>acquaint him that she had the things. Accordingly, he went and
</p>
<p>received them. The prisoner was taken, and carried before Justice
</p>
<p>St. Lawrence, who asked him how he came by the things? he said,
</p>
<p>he was at the house with some other company, and that he held the
</p>
<p>bag while they put them in ; and that it was the first fact. Then
</p>
<p>Egan, upon searching him, found the buckles wrapt up in his
</p>
<p>'apron.
</p>
<p>Mary Jones, who had lent these goods to Egan on purpose that
</p>
<p>he might be robbed of them, deposed that she lived in Broker's-
</p>
<p>alley, by Drury-Iane; that the prisoner and another person (meaning
</p>
<p>Tom Blee) came on the day laid in the indictment, about four
</p>
<p>o'clock in the afternoon, to her house, and asked her if she would
</p>
<p>buy some things. She desired to know what they were ? They
</p>
<p>said they would bring them presently, went away, and came again
</p>
<p>about nine o'clock, and brought the things. She told them she

</p>
<p>would not look at them that night, because it was too late. They
</p>
<p>came to her again the next day for the money for the goods. She
</p>
<p>bid them go to some place, and stay a little. Accordingly they
</p>
<p>\vent to a public-house in Long Acre, where she followed them, in
</p>
<p>order to have them secured. She stopt the prisoner, but the other
</p>
<p>ran away ; and the prisoner then said he brought the things from a
</p>
<p>house on Little Saffron-hill. She said, How did you get into the
</p>
<p>house ? he replied, There was a fellow who broke open the door,
</p>
<p>who went in, and he after him, and he put the things in the bag,
</p>
<p>aud brought them away. She then sent a man to Saffron-hill, to
</p>
<p>enquire what house \vas broke open, who found the prosecutor dis-
</p>
<p>coursing about it, and brought him back with him, and they took
</p>
<p>the prisoner to Justice St. Lawrence, who, after examination, com-
</p>
<p>mitted him.
</p>
<p>The prisoner, in his defence, said, It was the first fact he wa%
</p>
<p>II
</p>
<p>ver guilty of in his life, and did this for want. Guilty of Felony
</p>
<p>only.
</p>
<p>But, however dexterously this fine scheme was contrived, the
</p>
<p>projectors missed their aim; for, the jury finding the prisoner guilty
</p>
<p>of felony only, he was transported, and consequently they lost
</p>
<p>their expected reward ; which so enraged them, that they all swore
</p>
<p>that somebody should pay for it severely. Blee was ordered to
</p>
<p>look out sharp, and Mrs. Jones and Berry were to be prosecutors
</p>
<p>in their next adventure. Their resolution was fatal to poor
</p>
<p>JOSHUA KID DEN, as will be proved by the ensuing trial, which we
</p>
<p>give nearly at large, that the reader may see to what horrible lengths
</p>
<p>these execrable and blood-thirsty villains carried their cruel and
</p>
<p>inhuman prosecutions.
</p>
<p>JOSHUA KIDDEN was indicted for that he, on the King's highway,
</p>
<p>on Mary Jones, widow, did make an assault, putting her in corporal
</p>
<p>fear and danger of her life, and stealing from her person one guinea
</p>
<p>and four shillings and sixpence in money numbered, January 7,
</p>
<p>1754.
</p>
<p>Mary Jones. I live in Broker's-alley, Drury-lane. Last Monday
</p>
<p>was se'nnight, in the morning, I went to Mr. Berry, and asked him
</p>
<p>to go along with me to Edmonton. We set out in a chaise about
</p>
<p>twelve or one o'clock from Hatton Garden, and going to the Bell
</p>
<p>at Edmonton, staid there very near three hours. We went to en-
</p>
<p>quire for a man I wanted to see, and set out between five and six
</p>
<p>to come home. I got out at the Plough at Tottenham, by reason
</p>
<p>the horse kicked very much ; and we had two pints of hot ale and
</p>
<p>rum. Mr. Berry desired me to walk a little, to see how the horse
</p>
<p>would go, and 1 believe I did walk about a quarter of a mile : he
</p>
<p>then called to me, and said the horse went very well, and he be-
</p>
<p>lieved I might get in. As I was going to get into the chaise, two
</p>
<p>fellows came round me, and said, You shall not get in; we must
</p>
<p>have what you have. One of them held my arms, and, taking a
</p>
<p>great knife out of his pocket, said he would stick me, and that
</p>
<p>fellow in the chaise, if 1 spoke a word. The other took my pocket,

</p>
<p>in which was a guinea, half a crown, two shillings, and a trifle more.
</p>
<p>They then run away, and I stood by a post, not being able to stand
</p>
<p>for some time,
</p>
<p>John Berry. Last Monday was se'nnight Mrs. Jones came to
</p>
<p>me, and desired me to go with her to Edmonton, lo see for a man
</p>
<p>who owed her about 9!. .We set out from thence about six o'clock ;
</p>
<p>and coming back, the buckle of the strap had got through, and
</p>
<p>the horse fell a kicking up much ; upon which I desired her to get
</p>
<p>out This was near the Plough at Tottenham, where we drank two
</p>
<p>pints of rum and ale. There was another man with us. I desired
</p>
<p>her to walk a little till I saw how the horse would go. She walked
</p>
<p>about a quarter of a mile, and then I said to her, you may get in ;
</p>
<p>but as she was getting in two men caught hold of her. The prisoner
</p>
<p>was one of them ; his stockings were tied below knee, and he had a
</p>
<p>white waistcoat ou. I believe it was the prisoner who held a kniffe
</p>
<p>12
</p>
<p>to her, and said, You old bitch, if you make a noise I'll stfck yoq,
</p>
<p>and the man in the chnise too. They took her aside, and the othef
</p>
<p>person took her money. This was just facing the seven trees called
</p>
<p>the Seven Sisters. I being lame, could not get out of the chaise.
</p>
<p>They then ran as fast as they could.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you see them take her money ?
</p>
<p>Berry. I s,ayv them put a hand to her pocket, and I know she
</p>
<p>had that money about her, \yhen she came out of the house. I got
</p>
<p>^ man to help her into the chaise, and we called at the first house
</p>
<p>pn the left hand, where we had a quartern of rum. I drove along,
</p>
<p>enquiring of every body ; and at Newington called at a house, and
</p>
<p>told them how we had been served. A man came out along with
</p>
<p>me; I asked the patroleif they saw such persons, and about twenty
</p>
<p>yards distance I saw them both running. This was before we came
</p>
<p>to Kiiigsland turnpike; the other man got over a ditch, and the
</p>
<p>prisoner was taken. We carried him to a house on this side the
</p>
<p>turnpike. I said, how could you take the money from this poor
</p>
<p>woman ? He said, he did not take the money, but only stood by.
</p>
<p>\Ve then had him before Justice Withers ; and he then said his
</p>
<p>name was Joshua Kidden, and that he lived in Blackboy-alley : h$
</p>
<p>bad on two waistcoats and a cap.
</p>
<p>Cross- fixamined.
</p>
<p>Q. How many persons have you prosecuted here ?
</p>
<p>Berry. I believe I prosecuted a man about eighteen yenrs ago :
</p>
<p>he stole horses, and I stopped him. That is the only person I have
</p>
<p>been concerned in the prosecution of in my life.*
</p>
<p>Prisoner's Defence.
</p>
<p>I know nothing of robbing the woman.
</p>
<p>Several creditable persons deposed to their belief in the honesty

<p>Thus fell pp r Kidden a. sacrifice to the avarice of these wretches,
</p>
<p>whom neither the sacredness of oaths, nor the consideration of
</p>
<p>shedding innocent blood, could restrain from committing the most

<p>cent of the fact for which he was prosecuted, tried, condeirned,
</p>
<p>and executed, was afterwards rendered manifest, as well as the strict
</p>
<p>truth of the following account.
</p>
<p>The Case of Joshua Kidden, written by himself.
</p>
<p>" I by chance got acquainted with a person (Blee) at the Castle in
</p>
<p>Chick-lane, the bottom of Saffron-hill ; and being just come out of
</p>
<p>the country from my relations, near Lambourn in Berkshire, I was
</p>
<p>complaining for want of business. I was bred to the sea, and was
</p>
<p>willing to do any servile business as a porter. This person I got
</p>
<p>acquainted with, told me, he had got a job to do at Tottenham, to
</p>
<p>* Only a few sessions before, Berry had prosecuted a rnan to couvictioa
</p>
<p>in the same court.

</p>
<p>remove some goods for a gentleman, who was afraid they would be 1
</p>
<p>seized on for rent. Accordingly we went on the appointed day, and
</p>
<p>going from one ale-house to another till evening came on, was at last
</p>
<p>told by my companion, who pretended to see for the gentleman,
</p>
<p>that he had seen him, and it was too late to remove to-night, but he
</p>
<p>had given him eighteen-pence for my trouble, and that we must
</p>
<p>come another day. Going home, we met with a chaise, with a man
</p>
<p>and woman in it, at a place called the Seven Sisters, on this side
</p>
<p>Tottenham, where the woman was set down from the chaise, and
</p>
<p>walked up the road, and I, as I past by her, said, are you going to
</p>
<p>London : It was now about seven o'clock at night : She answered,
</p>
<p>Yes, and I passed on. This companion of mine, unknown by name,
</p>
<p>behind, called out, what do you walk so fast for ? my answer was.
</p>
<p>To get to London: but, turning about, saw him robbing the woman.
</p>
<p>He then ran after me, and said, here I have got sonie money, and
</p>
<p>would have forced half-a-crown into my hand, but I refused it.
</p>
<p>Then he said, Joshua, don't leave me; I must step into the ditch and
</p>
<p>ease myself. And, walking gently on to wait for my companion, up
</p>
<p>starts one Mac Daniel, a thief-catcher, and collars me, and said, you
</p>
<p>are my prisoner. He carried me directly to a justice, before whom
</p>
<p>the woman swore, that I, with a person unknown, robbed her of
</p>
<p>five-and-<wenty shillings and sixpence. So I was committed to
</p>
<p>jail, and tried on the woman's swearing, that I, with the unknown
</p>
<p>person, robbed her, and threatened her life. The person's name
</p>
<p>that was in the chaise, is Berry ; the woman's name, Jones ; the man
</p>
<p>well-known to be a thief-catcher ; the woman of as bad a character
</p>
<p>as needs be.*''
</p>
<p>Joshua Kidden, when executed, was twenty-six years of age. He
</p>
<p>was born of respectable parents, and well educated, being put out
</p>
<p>apprentice at the proper time, with no small sum of money, to an
</p>
<p>apothecary. Unhappily for him, he quitted his profession, and went
</p>
<p>to sea ; but neither did this line of life long suit liis inclination ; and,
</p>
<p>being deserted by his friends, he was gradually reduced to the neccs.

<p>became acquainted with Thomas Blee, the miscreant who inveigled
</p>
<p>him to destruction. He died declaring his innocence, but with great
</p>
<p>resignation. His letters are most affecting.f
</p>
<p>* Every word of this account appears to have been true. The horror of
</p>
<p>this young man's murder exceeds all the rest, because, though imprudent,
</p>
<p>there is every reason to believe that he was strictly honest. The man

<p>Berry, and the woman Jones, what a pair ! Imagination sinks under the
</p>
<p>conception of such diabolical wickedness.
</p>
<p>f The case of this unfortunate young man is so analogous to that of the
</p>
<p>three poor condemned Irishmen, that we involuntarily shudder at the pro-
</p>
<p>bable number of sacrifices to the ' good of the country,' as the casuist
</p>
<p>Paley calls innocent victims to the laws, which this brokering for reward has
</p>
<p>from time to time offered up. Without alluding to direct villainy, the
</p>
<p>mischief which may arise from it is obvious. Many people may reaollect
</p>
<p>he murder of a Mr. F r, some years ago, and the subsequent txecution.
</p>
<p>of a man for the same, whom Miss F, was urged to swear to on imperfect
</p>
<p>14
</p>
<p>Money beginning in a short time to run very low with the confe-
</p>
<p>derate gang, Berry and Mac Daniel consulted Thomas Blee to look
</p>
<p>out for a couple of fellows proper for conviction ; and it was agreed
</p>
<p>that the robbery was to be done on Salmon, near the four-mile-stone,
</p>
<p>going to Deptford, for two reasons ; namely, because there was a
</p>
<p>reward of ^20. offered by the gentlemen of East-Greenwich ; and
</p>
<p>because Kidden's affair had made such a noise at the Old Bailey,
</p>
<p>but at Maidstone was not known.* This affair led to a discovery
</p>
<p>of these monstrous practices, and to preserve the connection, it is
</p>
<p>necessary to anticipate a little in this place, by stating, that the vile
</p>
<p>accomplice, Blee, procured two youths,, who were entrapped, and
</p>
<p>tried like poor Kidden, though not like him altogether innocent ; but
</p>
<p>that by the vigilance of Mr. Cox, chief constable of the Lower Hun-
</p>
<p>dred of Blackheath, Blee was also taken, and immediately impeached
</p>
<p>his villainous employers, who were, indicted at the Old Bailey under
</p>
<p>the Acts of 4 and 5 Philip and Mary, and 3 and 4 William and
</p>
<p>Mary. The best history of their diabolical proceedings, is unfolded
</p>
<p>by the evidence of Blee, which on the trial was as follows : .
</p>
<p>TJwmas Blee sworn.
</p>
<p>Thomas Bhe. I have known the prisoner Berry eight or nine
</p>
<p>years, and Mac Daniel twelve months last November. I never had
</p>
<p>any great acquaintance with Salmon, till through Berry in the month
</p>
<p>of June last. I have known Egan four or five years, by his coming
</p>
<p>backwards and forwards to Berry's.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you know Peter Kelly and John Ellis?
</p>
<p>A. I did ; I believe they are now in Maidstone gaol ; they were
</p>
<p>when I came away last Monday.
</p>
<p>Q. Tell the Court the first time you had any conversation with
</p>
<p>them.
</p>
<p>A. I lodged at Berry's house, and worked for him : Berry said
</p>
<p>to me, in the beginning of July, go to Mr. Mac Daniel, (he lived
</p>
<p>then in Scrub's-Court, Holborn), and tell him, I want to speak with
</p>
<p>him. I went, and he and I came back together to Berry's house.
</p>
<p>They both said, Tom, money grows scarce, you must give a sharp

<p>look-out for a couple to go upon the scamp now, and, if you can't
</p>
<p>get two, you must get one.
</p>
<p>recollection. The young lady was absolutely persuaded, against her own
</p>
<p>salutary doubt in the first instance, to depose positively in Court, and a
</p>
<p>person was banged who was innocent, at least another malefactor subse-
</p>
<p>quently acknowledged to the crime.
</p>
<p>* This remark would lead us to imagine, that in tbe reign of Geo. II. as
</p>
<p>at present, people would form extra judicial opinions upon guilt and inno-
</p>
<p>cence ; and, as in the case of ELIZABETH PENNING, sometimes pause
</p>
<p>upon an Old Bailey conviction. Several circumstances deposed to in the
</p>
<p>following evidence, prove that low persons thought Kidden innocent, long
</p>
<p>before his innocence w us proved ; to say nothing of the better bred indi-
</p>
<p>viduals, who, as the man was hanged, thought it useless to trouble their
</p>
<p>heads about it. The observations relative to the o20. reward offered by
</p>
<p>the gentlemen of Greenwich, is a fine lesson of caution to well-intentioned
</p>
<p>people how they distribute money in this way.
</p>

</p>
<p>15
</p>
<p>Q. What did they mean by goiug upon th scamp?
</p>
<p>A. That is, to go upon the highway. 1 told them, as Kiddeu'*
</p>
<p>was so .bad an affair, I did not chuse to be concerned more. He wag
</p>
<p>convicted last January was twelvemonth, and executed at Tyburn.
</p>
<p>Mac Daniel said, d n your eyes, if you don't, it shall be worse
</p>
<p>for you. Then Berry said, I might go about my business ; so I went
</p>
<p>awav. The next morning Berry called me into his room.
</p>
<p>Q. Where did he live"?
</p>
<p>A. At a place called the George-yard, at the upper end of
</p>
<p>Hatton -garden. He then said, go up to Mr. Mac Daniel's house,
</p>
<p>and desire him to meet me in the fields about eleven o'clock. I did.
</p>
<p>and we went into Spa-fields, and Berry came to us. They both
</p>
<p>said to me, go and look about the fields, and we will sit down on th
</p>
<p>grass, and see if you can pick up a couple of idle fellows, that will
</p>
<p>do for the purpose, and introduce yourself into their company.
</p>
<p>Q. What did they mean by the purpose ?
</p>
<p>A. To go upon the scamp were the words they said : accordingly
</p>
<p>we three went into the fields several days, but could not meet witti
</p>
<p>any body fit for the purpose. I remember one day in particular, it
</p>
<p>was Monday the 1 5th of July ; that day they ordered me to go into
</p>
<p>the fields, and said they would come, and I sat there two hours be-
</p>
<p>fore they came nigh me ; then Mac Daniel came to the top of the
</p>
<p>bill, and bid me come to the sign of Sir John Qldcastle, a public-
</p>
<p>house, ami said my master was there : he and I went there, and down
</p>
<p>to the bottom of the yard, and in the farthest arbour but one, ou
</p>
<p>the left hand side, there sat Berry and Salmon the breeches-maker.
</p>
<p>Berry bid me sit down, which I did : there we all discoursed together
</p>
<p>about doing this robbery: Mac Daniel said, we'll do the thing
</p>
<p>somewhere towards Blacklieath : then he and Berry had a sort of a
</p>
<p>wrangle whetlier they should not have it done between New Cros*
</p>
<p>turnpike aud Deptford, just facing the four-mile-stone.
</p>
<p>Q. Was tljere any particular reason to have it done in that place ?
</p>
<p>A. Yes ; they said, there is a reward of twenty pounds that w
</p>
<p>given by the inhabitants of East Greenwich for apprehending high-

</p>
<p>waymen and footpads. Berry said, suppose we have Egan concerned
</p>
<p>with us: then tliey talked about his being the fence, as they call it.
</p>
<p><?. What did they mean by that word ?
</p>
<p>A. That is to buy the goods after Salmon had been robbed of
</p>
<p>them. Mac Daniel made an objection to Egan's being in, because
</p>
<p>he thought five would be too many to be concerned in the reward :
</p>
<p>Berry said, we can't cleverly do without him, and if there are five of
</p>
<p>us concerned, it would be pretty nigh twenty pounds each, if a con-
</p>
<p>stable should come in. And they all three, that is Berry, Mac Daniel,
</p>
<p>and Salmon, concluded that Egan should be concerned as a fence in
</p>
<p>the robbery, and Berry said he would go and let Egan know of it
</p>
<p>that night ; and said to me, Now, Tom, you may go home about
</p>
<p>your business, we will not be seen to walk along the streets together:
</p>
<p>ao I went suvay and left them. The next morning I went out again
</p>
<p>to see if I could find any body for the purpose, but I could not
</p>
<p>16
</p>
<p>day : the next after, which was on a Wednesday, Mr. Berry called
</p>
<p>me into his room, and ordered me to go and tell Mac Daniel to come
</p>
<p>to him to the Bell inn in Holborn : I went, and Mac Daniel and I
</p>
<p>vent to the Bell together ; there was James Egan, James Salmon,
</p>
<p>and Berry ; we were all five together : they bid me come and sit
</p>
<p>down, which I did, and drank part of a pot of beer; then we all
</p>
<p>concluded that the thing should be done.
</p>
<p>Q. What thing was to be done?
</p>
<p>A. That, if 1 could get a couple to go on the highway, that
</p>
<p>Salmon should be the person to be robbed ; and that Berry and
</p>
<p>Salmon talked about making two pair of breeches that Salmon was
</p>
<p>to be robbed of, and to mark them under the pocket or waistband
</p>
<p>with some particular mark : to the best of my knowledge it was to
</p>
<p>be J. S Then Berry and Mac Daniel said, they must have a par-
</p>
<p>ticular handkerchief too; then Mac Daniel put his hand into his
</p>
<p>pocket, and pulled out this handkerchief that I have now in my hand.
</p>
<p>James Salmon said, that he had got a handkerchief at home that he
</p>
<p>would mark so as to swear to it, which he was to mark with four
</p>
<p>oilet holes, one at each corner. Berry said they should want a
</p>
<p>tobacco-box; Mac Daniel said, he had got a very remarkable one,
</p>
<p>that any body might swear to, which I have fetched forty halfpenny-
</p>
<p>worths of tobacco in for Mac Daniel, and I know it to be the same
</p>
<p>now (taking it in his hand.} Mac Daniel said, he would give it to
</p>
<p>Salmon to be robbed of: then they said, they wanted a halfpenny,
</p>
<p>and would have it marked. Mac Daniel said he had got a pocket-
</p>
<p>piece, which piece I saw his wife buy for three-pence and a halfpenny-
</p>
<p>worth of gin some time before ; he said that would do, and it should
</p>
<p>be marked with a shoe-maker's tool, and he gave it to Egan to mark
</p>
<p>jt : Egan said he had got a tool that he used to stamp the shoes
</p>
<p>with, that he would mark the piece with ; then they bid me go home
</p>
<p>about my business, which I did. The next morning, Berry called
</p>
<p>me up into his room again : he gave me three pence, and ordered
</p>
<p>me to go down to the FleeUmarket to see if I could pick up two
</p>
<p>men or lads' there.*

</p>
<p>Q. Did he say any thing more at that time ?
</p>
<p>A. He said, to do the thing. I knew what he meant ; accord-
</p>
<p>ingly I went down to the market, and met with Peter Kelly and
</p>
<p>John Ellis.
</p>
<p>Q. Did you know them before ?
</p>
<p>A. I did'; I knew them to be very bad lads, that is, pick-pockets.
</p>
<p>I gave them some gin, but had no discourse with them that day
</p>
<p>about the thing. The next morning Berry called me into his room
</p>
<p>again, and gave me three-pence more, and bid me go down to Fleet-
</p>
<p>market to them, and be sure to hare a little talk with them, and told
</p>
<p>me what to say, and that was to tell them I knew where to get a
</p>
<p>brave parcel of lullies.
</p>
<p>* Compare this evidence wilh the confession of Drake, the wooden-
</p>
<p>legged accomplice of 1816.
</p>
<p>Q. What is the meaning of that ?
</p>
<p>A. He meant tb get a parcel of linen, if they would go with me
</p>
<p>to Deptford ; I went and met them there, and told them as Berry
</p>
<p>ordered me ; that is, I told them I knew where to get a brave
</p>
<p>parcel of follies, if they would go to Deptford with me.
</p>
<p>Blee's evidence here proceeds in a disgusting detail of his manner
</p>
<p>of enticing Ellis and Kelly. He met with them in Fleet-market on
</p>
<p>a Friday ; they were on a pea-cart ; he treated them with gin, and
</p>
<p>left them. In two hours he returned, and prevailed on them to
</p>
<p>assist him in stealing lullies. He acain left them to concert with.
</p>
<p>Berry; and on Sunday morning he found them in the brick-fields,
</p>
<p>and treated them again. On Monday, Egan went to look at the
</p>
<p>boys : he stood three or four yards from them without pretending;
</p>
<p>to know Blee, who pointed them out by giving them a halfpenny
</p>
<p>each to go and get some gin. Blee then went one way, and Egau
</p>
<p>another, but met immediately at Mac Daniel's house, where Egaa
</p>
<p>expressed his opinion of the boys to Berry and Mac Daniel, by say-
</p>
<p>ing, " by G d, they'll do very well, they are two pretty lads /"
</p>
<p>Blee continued to arrange the complete ensnaring of the boys until
</p>
<p>Tuesday, seeing them in the interim, and treating them repeatedly.
</p>
<p>Blee on that day appointed Berry and Mac Daniel to go and see the
</p>
<p>lads in the Artillery-ground, which they did. Blee walked with
</p>
<p>them, whilst the others looked on as if strangers to him. Blee met
</p>
<p>Berry presently after, and said, " Mr. Berry, do you think they
</p>
<p>will do ?" He said, " Do ? d n me, / have done less than they
</p>
<p>over, for March and Newman were less!" Mac Daniel said the
</p>
<p>same. Berry desired Blee not to lose sight of the boys, and gave
</p>
<p>him money from time to time to treat them until the job was ripe.
</p>
<p>On Thursday night, (says Blee), Berry, Mac Daniel, Egan, and
</p>
<p>Salmon, agreed that it should not be done on the Friday, lest the
</p>
<p>lads should be apprehended on the Saturday, and kept all day 011
</p>
<p>Sunday in the watch-house, and somebody might come to them, to
</p>
<p>whom he might tell something about my being concerned with them,
</p>
<p>and so, by impeaching me, I might be apprehended : so they had
</p>
<p>therefore fixed it to be on the Monday; on which morning I got up by

<p>Mr. Berry's orders: he gave me two-pence or three-pence, I can't
</p>
<p>le positive which, to go to the Fleet.rnarket to meet them, and bid
</p>
<p>them stay till nine o'clock, and say I would come to them again,
</p>
<p>which I did, and returned, as Berry ordered me, to him at the
</p>
<p>Plumb-Tree ale-house ; there was Salmon and he : he sent me out
</p>
<p>for Mac Daniel ; I went to him, and he bid me tell Berry he was
</p>
<p>shaving himself, and he would come when he had done. 1 went and
</p>
<p>told Berry : he changed a guinea, and gave me five shillings, and bid
</p>
<p>me not to be extravagant : he gave me that, as he said, tojlash to the
</p>
<p>boys, to shew it to them, and say I made that last night* ; 1 was to pull
</p>
<p>it out all at once. He gave Salmon half-a-crown to be robbed of.

</p>
<p>18
</p>
<p>Q. Who were present at this time ?
</p>
<p>A. There were Berry, Mac iDaniel, and Salmon; then Berrjf
</p>
<p>said to me, now go away as fast as you can ; and I said, at what
</p>
<p>place shall I stop for you to see you are going, that we may both,
</p>
<p>be sure ? I said, I will stop at the Bell in the Borough, and call for
</p>
<p>a. glass of gin ; then you may know and be sure that we are going to
</p>
<p>Deptford. I left them, and went to the two boys.
</p>
<p>Q. About what time was this?
</p>
<p>A. It was about half an hour after nine in the morning. I went
</p>
<p>with the boys to a liouse in Little Britain, there I called for some
</p>
<p>beer, and bread and cheese, and pulled off my coat, and said, I must
</p>
<p>go to the fence and get some money, for the woman has not paid
</p>
<p>me all. Then I left iny great coat, and went to Berry, and told
</p>
<p>him to hasten away, for the boys wanted to go. Berry bid me re.
</p>
<p>turn to them directly, and said he would be over the water time
</p>
<p>enough for us. I went to the boys again, and called for another
</p>
<p>pot of beer to delay the time. After we had drank that, we went
</p>
<p>out to go to Deptford. When we came to the Bell in the Borough^
</p>
<p>we went in, and in the right-hand box there sat Berry and Salmon ;
</p>
<p>there I gave the boys each of them a halfpenny worth of gin ; I was
</p>
<p>not to take notice of Berry or Salmon.
</p>
<p>Q. What time did you set out from Kent.street?
</p>
<p>A. We set out from thence about half an hour after twelve
</p>
<p>o'clock ; I had made them almost drunk. After we went from
</p>
<p>thence, it was too soon in the day, we could do nothing till it was
</p>
<p>dark, I told them, so we could go over into the fields, and go to sleep ;
</p>
<p>so, to prolong the time, we went into the fields, and all three of us
</p>
<p>went to sleep. They slept pretty heartily.* When I thought it
</p>
<p>proper time to awake then), I did, and away we went to Deptford.
</p>
<p>Q. What time did you set out after this sleep?
</p>
<p>A. I can't tell the time.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it dark?
</p>
<p>A. No, it was not. We were in Deptford an hour before dark;
</p>
<p>t went with them to the sign of the Ship, the house that Berry and

</p>
<p>Salmon had appointed to come to. I called for a pint of beer at
</p>
<p>the door, and bid them stay there ; and said I had a relation in the
</p>
<p>town, near the Water-gate, which I wanted to see. I left them,
</p>
<p>and went to see for Berry and Salmon. I found Berry, he and I
</p>
<p>\vent into a public-house, I think it was the Duke William's Head ;
</p>
<p>he called for a pint of beer, and bid me return to the two boys, and
</p>
<p>Salmon should come to the house. I went to them, they were still
</p>
<p>at the door; I said, come, let us go into the house, 1 expect my
</p>
<p>cousin to come to me.
</p>
<p>Q. Had you let the boys into any knowledge of this affair before
</p>
<p>you came to this place?
</p>
<p>A. No, I did not ; only I had told them it was to steal some
</p>
<p>liuen; they went for no other intent. Then I went in, and called
</p>
<p>* Blee, and all. Sleep the innocent Sleep! What a picture!
</p>
<p>19
</p>
<p>for a pot of beer, and bread and cheese ; we eat the bread and
</p>
<p>clieeie, and drank the beer, and called for another pot of beer ; in
</p>
<p>.the mean time, in came Salmon. He tirst went and leaned against a
</p>
<p>dresser, for about half a minute, and then came and sat down in
</p>
<p>the box near us, and began to discourse about going to London,
</p>
<p>(it was then dusk.) I saw Berry go by the window, he beckoned
</p>
<p>his finger, and I went out to him. He said, be sure follow Salmon
</p>
<p>when he conies out. I went in again, and Salmon presently went
</p>
<p>out. When Salmon first came in, Kelly said, There is that old
</p>
<p>blood, the breeches-maker, in Shoe-lane; his son and I have been
</p>
<p>picking of pockets together many a time. I said, never mind that,
</p>
<p>what is that to us? I knew the place where he was to stop at; it
</p>
<p>was just by the four-mile stone, this was agreed upon before. The
</p>
<p>two boys and I went on, and by the four-mile stone, by a gate,
</p>
<p>Salmon stood, making believe he was making water. D n me,
</p>
<p>said Kelly, there is the old breeches-maker, he is sucky, let's
</p>
<p>scamp him.
</p>
<p>Q. What reason did you give Kelly and Ellis for your going after
</p>
<p>Salmon ?
</p>
<p>A. I said, we will take a walk till it is time to steal the linen.
</p>
<p>Q. Was it light or dark?
</p>
<p>A. The moon shone. Kelly said, when he came up to Salmon,
</p>
<p>G d d n you, what have you got there? Salmon said, Gentle-
</p>
<p>men, take what I have got, don't use me ill. He had the breeches
</p>
<p>under his arm, and he gave them to me ; they were in a blue-and-
</p>
<p>white handkerchief, and I gave them to Kelly. I said to Kelly,
</p>
<p>what money have you got ? Salmon said, here, Gentlemen, what
</p>
<p>money I have got is in my left-hand waistcoat pocket, in a tobacco,
</p>
<p>box ; (he had told me before, what money lie had got would be
</p>
<p>there.) Kelly put his hand into his pocket, and took the tobacco.
</p>
<p>box out, and a clasp-knife and fork ; then away we walked on for
</p>
<p>London, and came into Kent-street as fast as we could, and lodged
</p>
<p>there all night, at a house where I paid the money at going down,
</p>
<p>by Berry's order, to induce the lads to come there again.

</p>
<p>Q. What time did you get to Kent-street after the robbery ?
</p>
<p>A. I believe we got there about eleven o'clock; the people had
</p>
<p>no clock in the house.
</p>
<p>Q. What money did you take from Salmon ?
</p>
<p>A. We looked at that coming along; 1 knew what was in it be.
</p>
<p>fore ; there were two shillings and sixpence, and a pocket-piece
</p>
<p>with Skilion on it, or some such name, and a punch'd mark in the
</p>
<p>middle of it.
</p>
<p>Court. Look at this tobacco-box.

<p>this box a hundred times in my hand before.

<p>A. This is the same piece which I mentioned before.

<p>Court. Look at this knife.
</p>
<p>A. It is the same knife.
</p>
<p>Q. What was done the next morning, when you lay in Kent-
</p>
<p>street?
</p>
<p>A. VVe got up the next morning about seveu o'clock, and went
</p>
<p>over the way to the sign of the Black Spread Eagle, (the house that
</p>
<p>Berry ordered me to go to.) I called for some beer, and said to
</p>
<p>Kelly and Ellis, sit down, and I will fetch you something for
</p>
<p>breakfast. I went out with that pretence, and went to the White
</p>
<p>Bear in the same street, where Berry ordered me to come to let
</p>
<p>him know. There sat Berry, Egan, and Salmon at the door, on
</p>
<p>the bench. Berry said, Mac Daniel is not come yet; now we must
</p>
<p>wait for him. Go you back, and Egan shall come after you di-
</p>
<p>rectly. Egan and I walked up the street a little way together. I
</p>
<p>said, stop there a bit, while I go over to that shop to buy a lamb's
</p>
<p>liver for breakfast; he said he would go on. He went on before,
</p>
<p>and called for a pint of beer ; I came after with the liver. I said to
</p>
<p>Ellis and Kelly, as I was going to cut the liver, that man deals in
</p>
<p>rag-fair, (meaning Egan,) at the same time I knew he did not, but I
</p>
<p>was to say so when he came hi. I said, may.be he will buy the
</p>
<p>breeches ? Shall I ask him ? Yes, said they, with all our hearts. I
</p>
<p>said to him, master, will you buy some leather breeches ; he said,
</p>
<p>let me look at them ; if you and I can agree, I will buy them.
</p>
<p>After he had looked at them, he said, what will you have for
</p>
<p>them ? I said six shillings. He said, I will give you five. He
</p>
<p>put his hand into his pocket, and gave Kelly a shilling earnest, and
</p>
<p>said, he had not so much money about him, but he would come in an
</p>
<p>hour or two, and pay the rest of the money, and he would leave
</p>
<p>the breeches in our care till he came back. I said, my friend, will
</p>
<p>you eat a bit of liver and bacon before you go t He said, I don't
</p>
<p>care if I do. He sat down by the fire side, and said, landlord, let
</p>
<p>us have a halfpenny.worth of tobacco, and said, God bless me, I
</p>
<p>don't know what I shall do ; I have lost my tobacco-box, (this he
</p>
<p>was to say to get the tobacco-box of them.) I said to Kelly, let

<p>us sell him the box, may be be will buy it. Kelly said, no, let us
</p>
<p>ding it ; it is such a remarkable one, may be it may be known.
</p>
<p>Q. What did he mean by dinging it ?
</p>
<p>A. He meant to fling it away ; I said, No, let us sell it ; then
</p>
<p>Kelly said, master, I will sell you a tobacco-box, if you'll buy it:
</p>
<p>he said, let me look at it; he looked at it, and asked what he
</p>
<p>xvould have for it? Kelly asked sixpence for it; he said, no, he
</p>
<p>would not give it; I said, we will not have dry money, we'll have
</p>
<p>some beer ; then Egan said, he would give a full pot of twopenny
</p>
<p>for it; then Kelly said, he should have it; after he had eat his
</p>
<p>breakfast, he went out, and goes to Berry and Salmon; I went
</p>
<p>backwards with the two boys, to play at skittles to detain them, but
</p>
<p>the ground was so wet we could not play, so we found another
</p>
<p>pastime called the devil and taylors. I kept them there an hour
</p>
<p>and half; then I said, if the man don't come, let us sell the
</p>
<p>3
</p>
<p>21
</p>
<p>fcreeches ; I said, I will go and be shaved, and I left my great coat
</p>
<p>and went to the White Bear ; but, when they came there, they did
</p>
<p>sot like the people of the house, because when Mac Daniel came
</p>
<p>they did not like him. I went out of the house, and saw Berry
</p>
<p>come out of the Elephant and Castle ; they beckoned me over ; I
</p>
<p>went and called for a pint of beer ; Berry said to me, you may
</p>
<p>drink with us, and said, d n you, where is your great coat ?
</p>
<p>(which is the same I have now,) he bid me turn back and fetch it,
</p>
<p>and said, Mac Daniel and Egan shall go.
</p>
<p>Q. Who were there ?
</p>
<p>A. There were all the four prisoners there, sitting in the box
</p>
<p>going in on the left-hand side, drinking ; I went back again to Ellis
</p>
<p>and Kelly, and said, the barber is busy, and can't shave me, I
</p>
<p>must come again in live or six minutes ; 1 said, the weather is cold,
</p>
<p>I must put my great coat on ; I put it on, and went to the Elephant
</p>
<p>and Castle to them again. Berry bid me go to the Bell in the Bo-
</p>
<p>rough, and stay there till he came, and to get shaved. I went
</p>
<p>away, and, as I was going, Egan and Mac Daniel went out ; I got
</p>
<p>shaved ; and went to the Bell in the Borough, and called for a
</p>
<p>pint of beer and drank it ; about an hour after, Berry came in, and.
</p>
<p>we had another pint ; then he and \ went homewards together; we;
</p>
<p>went as far as Ludgate Hill, there we saw one Mr. Rogers coming
</p>
<p>along, so he said, leave me, don't be seen with me, and I left him.
</p>
<p>At night, when Berry came home, I said to him, master, be so good
</p>
<p>as to lend me some money to go to the fair to-morrow ; he said,
</p>
<p>that is right, Uxbridge fair is to-morrow the 31st; he lent me
</p>
<p>eighteen pence, saying, it was to go to Billingsgate to buy shrimps
</p>
<p>\vith ; I went to the fair, and came back again on the 1st of August.
</p>
<p>Berry bid me not be afraid, saying, he would always keep a good
</p>
<p>look-out, and they always said, if I was taken up, Salmon should,
</p>
<p>never appear against me.*
</p>
<p>Q. Was you at the trial of Kelly and Ellis in Kent!
</p>
<p>A. No, I was not.
</p>
<p>Q. Where was you at the time of the trial ?

<p>A. 1 was taken up on the Friday before, being the 8th day of the
</p>
<p>, month.
</p>
<p>Q. What day was the robbery committed?
</p>
<p>A. It was on the 29th of July.
</p>
<p>This circumstantial deposition of Blee, was substantially corro,
</p>
<p>borated by that of a drummer, w,ho saw the lads taken in the con-
</p>
<p>certed way described by Blee.
</p>
<p>The next evidence details the fortunate apprehension of Blee, and
</p>
<p>of the means by which these villains were caught in their own snare.
</p>
<p>Joseph Cox sworn.
</p>
<p>Joseph Coy;. I have known Mac Daniel two or three years ; I
</p>
<p>never saw the other till I saw them all together at Maidstone as.
</p>
<p>* The miserable manner in which this wretched tool was rewarded by,
</p>
<p>the gang, proves that he was rather the slave of terror than of lucre.
</p>
<p>. 22
</p>
<p>Sizes ; I went down on the 14tli of August ; I am chief constable of
</p>
<p>the lower half hundred of Blackheath ; I had an information, about
</p>
<p>the beginning of August, that a breeches-maker had been robbed in
</p>
<p>the parish of Deptford, where I live, by three footpads, and that
</p>
<p>two of them were taken by Mac Daniel and others, and sent to-
</p>
<p>Maidstone gaol ; and the third person, whose name was Thomas
</p>
<p>Blee, I was informed, kept company with Mac Daniel ; and, after
</p>
<p>two or three day's searching, I very fortunately took the person,
</p>
<p>with the help of a constable, at Greenwich, on Friday, the 9th of
</p>
<p>August, in Newgate-street, very early in the morning. I took him
</p>
<p>directly to the water-side, in order to carry him to Greenwich;
</p>
<p>when we got him into the boat, he said he would discover all he
</p>
<p>could concerning the robbery of the breeches. maker; I bid him not
</p>
<p>do it then, because of the watermen, till we came to a magistrate ;
</p>
<p>we took him before Justice Bell ; there he made information, and
</p>
<p>signed it ; it contained the substance of the evidence he has now
</p>
<p>given against Mac Daniel, Berry, Salmon, and Egan, and therefore
</p>
<p>need not be repeated.
</p>
<p>As soon as this information was taken, (says Mr. Cox,) I obtained
</p>
<p>separate warrants against Mac Daniel, Berry, Salmon, and Egan. I
</p>
<p>was advised to attend the trial of Ellis and Kelly, and not to dis.
</p>
<p>cover I had Blee in custody till after the trial; and, in order that he
</p>
<p>might not escape, Thomas Warren went to assist me. When I
</p>
<p>came to Maidstone, I informed myself who were on the back of the
</p>
<p>bill of indictment against Ellis and Kelly ; their trial came on the
</p>
<p>15th of August, at night; I came into court soon after the trial be-
</p>
<p>gan ; Blee was then in my custody, but nabody knew it at Maidstone;
</p>
<p>he was brought down in the night, and stopped short of the town.
</p>
<p>When I came in, I heard Salmon giving evidence against Kelly and
</p>
<p>Ellis; he said, he went in at the Ship at Deptford, and had a pint
</p>
<p>of beer ; that he saw three men drinking in a box, and Ellis and
</p>
<p>Kelly, the then two prisoners at the bar, were two of the three per.
</p>
<p>sons, and the other was a carroty bearded fellow ; that after having
</p>
<p>drank his pint of beer, in the dusk of the evening, he set out iu

</p>
<p>order to go to London ; and having got as far as the four mile stone,
</p>
<p>lie stopped at a gate to make water. In the mean time the three
</p>
<p>men came up, and one of them d n'd him, and asked him where
</p>
<p>Le was going I he said, he desired him not to swear, and said, he
</p>
<p>was going to London ; upon that the carroty bearded fellow snatched^
</p>
<p>the bundle from under his arm, and punched him on the breast.
</p>
<p>The judge asked him, if it was light enough to see their faces, and
</p>
<p>whether he was sure that the prisoners were two of the men ? he
</p>
<p>said, it was light enough to see their faces, and was sure they were
</p>
<p>the men that robbed him. Then he said, that Kelly, one of the
</p>
<p>prisoners, drew a knife, and said, d n him, let us search him, and
</p>
<p>took out of his pocket an iron tobacco-box, in which was a guinea
</p>
<p>in gold, two shillings and sixpence in silver, and a silver pocket-
</p>
<p>piece, and a clasp knife and fork: he said, the bundle contained two
</p>
<p>pair of leather.breeches, marked with J. S. and a figure of 4 under
</p>
<p>the right pocket, and that the handkerchief had an oilet.hole at each
</p>
<p>corner, all which were produced in court ; he looked at them, and
</p>
<p>said, they were the goods he was robbed of, and were his property ;
</p>
<p>and they are the same here produced ; they were delivered into my
</p>
<p>care, and have been ever since. The Judge asked him, how he
</p>
<p>knew the pocket-piece ? he said, by a particular mark it had in the
</p>
<p>middle. His Lordship asked to see it, and it was handed to him.
</p>
<p>Q. Were the other prisoners there ?
</p>
<p>A. I saw Mac Daniel, Salmon, and Egan, who all gave their
</p>
<p>evidence ; but did not see Berry in Court. Egan next gave his evi.
</p>
<p>dence, and said, he dealt in old cloaths ; that on the 30th of July
</p>
<p>lie went into Kent-street, to the Lock Hospital, to see if they had
</p>
<p>any cloaths to sell, but, they not being up, he went to the Black
</p>
<p>Spread Eagle, to get him a pint of beer ; that he observed three
</p>
<p>men there drinking, and as he was telling the landlady his business,
</p>
<p>one of them, a carroty-bearded fellow, not taken, (for they did not
</p>
<p>know he was taken then,) asked him if he would buy two pair of
</p>
<p>breeches? he said, Yes, if they could agree for the price; and they
</p>
<p>did agree for 5s. and gave Kelly Is. earnest, till his wife should
</p>
<p>come with more money, or something of that sort ; and, as he was
</p>
<p>asking the landlady for a halfpenny-worth of tobacco, and saying
</p>
<p>he had lost his tobacco-box, one of the men offered to sell him
</p>
<p>one, and he bought it of him for a pot of twopenny. He said, as
</p>
<p>he was looking at the breeches, he knew them to be Salmon's pro-
</p>
<p>perty, having heard he had been robbed over night ; he went out
</p>
<p>pnder pretence of getting the rest of the money, but, meeting with
</p>
<p>Mr. Mac Daniel, an acquaintance of his, and knowing him to be
</p>
<p>an officer, he told him the story ; and Mac Daniel said, he need
</p>
<p>not trouble himself about an officer, for he could do as well as a
</p>
<p>constable ; and so he returned back with him, and took Ellis and
</p>
<p>Kelly ; and, upon searching them, took out of Kelly's pocket a sil.
</p>
<p>ver pocket-piece, Is. and a clasp-knife. He knew the breeches be-
</p>
<p>longed to Salmon by a particular mark. He said, he had bought
</p>
<p>breeches of him for himself and for his sou twelve years, and knew
</p>
<p>his mark. Mac Daniel was the next witness : he said, he met Egan,

</p>
<p>an acquaintance ; and Egan told him the story, and he went with
</p>
<p>him, and took Ellis and Kelly, and found upon Kelly a silver pocket,
</p>
<p>piece, a shilling, and a clasp-knife.
</p>
<p>I had fixed my eye pretty steadily on Mr. Berry, whom I asked
</p>
<p>to go with me to drink a glass of wine, which he did, and I se-
</p>
<p>cured him at the Bell ; then I went to secure the others according
</p>
<p>to my warrant. As soon as they had given their evidence, the crier
</p>
<p>ordered them to go out. We secured them; upon searching Mac
</p>
<p>Daniel,' I found this knifed upon him ; I was told of it before. As
</p>
<p>soon as they were secured, I was forced to get leave to put them in
</p>
<p>$he mayor's gaol. I asked Salmon, if he knew one Thomas Blee ?
</p>
<p>* Mac Daniel carried the knife as a weapon, lie is represented with
</p>
<p>it in the scarce original portrait, of which the print before the title is $n
</p>
<p>accurate copy.
</p>
<p>He said, he knew no such man : I replied, I am sure you musi
</p>
<p>know him ; he as positively denied it again. The next day, when,
</p>
<p>he was carried before the Justices, Blee was brought face to face
</p>
<p>to him : he looked at him, and declared he had never seeu that man
</p>
<p>in his life before. I asked Mac Daniel, if he knew Tom Blee ?
</p>
<p>He denied he knew any such person. I asked Egan, and he as
</p>
<p>positively denied it as the rest. As Berry and I were going to the
</p>
<p>Bell, he asked me what I thought would be the fate of Ellis and
</p>
<p>Kelly, and who was to pay the expence of the prosecution, for it
</p>
<p>was very considerable ; I told him, if they were convicted, there
</p>
<p>woujd be sufficient to pay the expences very handsomely ; and, if
</p>
<p>they were acquitted, the prosecutors, I believed, must bear the ex.
</p>
<p>pences themselves : he said, he knew that, and for that reason, if
</p>
<p>this affair was well over, he never would be concerned again. When
</p>
<p>I came to the Bell, I topk him into custody ; and, when I had se.
</p>
<p>cured the others in the Mayor's gaol, I carried him to them, and
</p>
<p>then asked him if he knew Tom Blee : He said, he did not know
</p>
<p>any such person. The next day, when Berry had been carried
</p>
<p>before the Justice, and was committed, he and I walked together
</p>
<p>from the Bell to the gaol , in going along he said, he hoped the
</p>
<p>gentlemen would not admit Mac Daniel as an evidence, because he
</p>
<p>had saved himself once before by the same means ; but, said he, if
</p>
<p>the gentlemen will admit me an evidence, I can do for Mac Daniel
</p>
<p>and another man, meaning Ralph Mitchel. I asked him, if he,
</p>
<p>would tell me any particulars he could alledge against them ? He
</p>
<p>said, he would write to me in a few days, but hp never did. As to
</p>
<p>Mac Daniel, the next morning after he was apprehended, he desired
</p>
<p>to speak with me in the room where he was confined. He then
</p>
<p>cried a good deal, and begged of me to be his friend, and get him
</p>
<p>committed for farther examination ; for, he said, he could make a
</p>
<p>very great discovery relating to the public, and could put g500. in
</p>
<p>my pocket. I told him, I would acquaint the gentlemen with what
</p>
<p>he said, and accordingly I did, and used my endeavours to prevent
</p>
<p>his being committed for farther examination : he was afterwards
</p>
<p>Committed on the warrant.*

<p>The trial lasted nine hours, and the Jury found them all four
</p>
<p>guilty of the facts charged in the indictment; but, whether the facts

<p>* When the compiler of the "History" stated, that nothing so mon-
</p>
<p>strous had been heard of in savage nations, not even in the annals of th^
</p>
<p>OLD BAILEY, he was correct in his gradation j for corrupted civiliza-
</p>
<p>tion is infinitely more deadly than ignorant barbarity. Regard the conduct
</p>
<p>of these wretches, Berry and Mac Daniel, each eager to betray the other
</p>
<p>on the first alarm of danger, and one of them the murderous miscreant I,
</p>
<p>warm from prosecution unto death, crying at his own misfortune. When
</p>
<p>the manner in which the conviction of Ellis and Kelly was arranged is con-
</p>
<p>sidered, and the calm deliberation with which each villain took up his part,
</p>
<p>what a field is open to the imagination, with respect to the consequences
</p>
<p>of many years' perseverance in the same course of murder and treachery.
</p>
<p>But more of this in the sequel.
</p>
<p>25
</p>
<p>charged were within the Statutes of the 4th and 5th of Philip and!
</p>
<p>Mary, and the 3d and 4th of William and Mary, they knew not ;
</p>
<p>and therefore prayed the assistance of the Court ; so it was made a
</p>
<p>special verdict.*
</p>
<p>It appears that the apprehensions of the miscreants were now
</p>
<p>great, for in November sessions they prayed the Court to be trans,
</p>
<p>ported for fourteen years; but on the 26th of June, 1755, the
</p>
<p>special verdict which the Jury gave upon the trial was argued by
</p>
<p>counsel before the twelve Judges, at Serjeant's-inn-hall, in Chan,
</p>
<p>cery.lane ; but the Court deferred hearing the whole then ; and, ia
</p>
<p>September following, their lordships being of opinion, that the
</p>
<p>facts charged were not within the Statutes of the 4th and 5th of
</p>
<p>Philip and Alary, and the 3d and 4th of William and Mary, an
</p>
<p>order was given, that they should be indicted for a conspiracy, in
</p>
<p>which the facts, with which the prisoners were charged, might be
</p>
<p>more clearly explained, and they to receive such punishment, as
</p>
<p>might be justly inflicted on them by law.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, on the 28th of February, 1756, they were again
</p>
<p>arraigned at the sessions at the Old Bailey, upon an indictment for
</p>
<p>combining and conspiring together, that one Thomas Blee should
</p>
<p>procure two persons, namely, Peter Kelly and John Ellis, to go to
</p>
<p>Deptford in Kent, and to take divers goods and money from the
</p>
<p>person of the said Salmon on the King's highway, who should be
</p>
<p>waiting there for that purpose ; with intent that they should cause
</p>
<p>the said two persons to be apprehended and convicted for robbing
</p>
<p>him, the said Salmon, on the King's highway, and so unjustly and
</p>
<p>wickedly procure to themselves the rewards mentioned in the Act
</p>
<p>of Parliament, proclamation, and other parochial rewards, for the
</p>
<p>apprehending of highwaymen, July 24, 1754.
</p>
<p>Blee was the principal witness against the prisoners in this, as he
</p>
<p>was upon the former, trial. One particular he swore in this, which
</p>
<p>he had omitted in his first evidence ; namely, that Berry told him,
</p>
<p>that, when he, Kelly and Ellis, robbed Salmon on the Deptford
</p>
<p>road, he, Berry, laid behind the four-milc.stone, and saw the rob.

<p>bery committed.
</p>
<p>The prisoners haying nothing material to say in their defence,
</p>
<p>* It is highly important to remark, that Mr. Cox, the constable who
</p>
<p>took these villains, suggested a plan to obtain tiieir capital conviction, hut
</p>
<p>which the powers that were did not think proper to adopt, and they
</p>
<p>escaped. There being statutes in force, by which comforting, aiding,
</p>
<p>abetting, hiring, commanding, or counselling the commission of a felonious
</p>
<p>act is made felony,, the thief-takers were indicted for thus aiding, hiring,
</p>
<p>and counselling ivclly and Ellis to rub Salmon ; but, because it did not
</p>
<p>appear that they did immediately and in person apply to Kelly and Ellis,
</p>
<p>the verdict was brought spedial. Mr. Cox therefore proposed to get Blee
</p>
<p>Convicted for robbing Salmon, and then, by obtaining a pardon for him,
</p>
<p>make him a legal evidence against the rest, for counselling, abetting, and
</p>
<p>hiring him to rob Salmon, which would have been within the Statute, as
</p>
<p>their application to Blee was immediate ; but this, though Blee consented,
</p>
<p>was not done, because the pardon of Blee could not be ensured.
</p>
<p>ihe Jury found them guilty. The sentence pronounced against
</p>
<p>them by the Court was, To be severally imprisoned in Newgate
</p>
<p>for the term of seven years ; and in that time to be each of them
</p>
<p>set in the pillory twice, in manner following ; Mac Daniel and
</p>
<p>Berry in Holborn, near Hatton-garden ; Egarrand Salmon in the
</p>
<p>middle of Smithfield ; afterwards, Mac Daniel and Berry at the
</p>
<p>end of King-street, Cheapside; and Egan and Salmon again in;
</p>
<p>Fleet-street, near Fetter-lane end ; and at the end of that time to
</p>
<p>find sureties for their good behaviour for three years, and to pay a
</p>
<p>fine of one mark each.
</p>
<p>Pursuant to their sentence, Mac Daniel and Berry, on the 5th of
</p>
<p>March, stood on the pillory in Holborn, near Hatton.garden.
</p>
<p>Mac Daniel, shortly after he was in, received a terrible wound in
</p>
<p>the forehead ; and Berry, who was weak before, could scarcely
</p>
<p>endure the vengeance of the populace. It was with the utmost
</p>
<p>difficulty that one of the sheriffs and the keeper of Newgate, who
</p>
<p>stood in a balcony just by, prevented their being utterly destroyed ;
</p>
<p>and so great was the mob, that the peace-officers found it impos.
</p>
<p>sible to protect the prisoners from their fury.
</p>
<p>March 8, Egan and Salmon stood in the pillory in the middle of
</p>
<p>Smithfield rounds ; they were instantly assaulted with showers of
</p>
<p>oyster-shells, stones, &c. and had not stood above half an hour
</p>
<p>before Egan was struck dead ; and Salmon was so dangerously
</p>
<p>wounded in the head, that it was thought impossible he should
</p>
<p>recover. A coroner's inquest was held on Egan, who brought in,
</p>
<p>a verdict of wilful murder against persons unknown. Thus,
</p>
<p>though the law could not find a punishment adequate to the horrid
</p>
<p>nature of their crimes, they met with their deserts from the rage of,
</p>
<p>the people.

<p>Thomas Blee went to Twickenham, whereat first, on enquiry, they
</p>
<p>were told there was no Mary Jones there ; but on enquiry at the
</p>
<p>house for a wrong person, Blee saw her coming down a walk in the
</p>
<p>garden, at a distance, (he being the only one that knew her) ; but
</p>
<p>she made her escape through the hedge into the next yard, and so
</p>
<p>into the cellar of the next house, where after a short search they
</p>
<p>found her under a beer-stand, rolled up like a hedge-hog. As
</p>
<p>soon as she was discovered, she held out her hand, and desired she
</p>
<p>might be helped up, which done, she was confronted with Blee,
</p>
<p>and absolutely persisted in having no knowledge of him, protesting
</p>
<p>she had never seen Blee before. However, they forthwith brought
</p>
<p>her to London in a coach, to the Jerusalem tavern on Clerkenwell
</p>
<p>Green ; and on hearing that Justice Spurling was not to be in town
</p>
<p>till the uext morning, they carried her for that night to the Flying
</p>
<p>57
</p>
<p>Horse In Bartholomew-close, where they secured her till the next
</p>
<p>day, and then carried her before Justice Spurlirig, who came to
</p>
<p>town on purpose.
</p>
<p>This wretch, while before the Justice, stiffly denied knowing
</p>
<p>Blee, who was present, or Mac Daniel, or Berry, or any thing
</p>
<p>concerning Kidden ; but Blee swearing positively to her, she waa
</p>
<p>that day, February 2d, committed to Newgate for the wilful
</p>
<p>murder of Joshua Kidden ; the commitment charging her, that she
</p>
<p>caused the said Joshua Kidden to be apprehended, and, by perjury,
</p>
<p>to be prosecuted and convicted of a robbery, pretended to have
</p>
<p>been committed by him, the said Kidden, on her the said Mary
</p>
<p>Jones, and for which he was unjustly executed.
</p>
<p>On Thursday the 29th of April, 1756, a bill of indictment was
</p>
<p>found against the three notorious miscreants, at Hicks's Hall, for
</p>
<p>the said wilful murder; and another indictment the same day was
</p>
<p>found by the same Grand Jury, charging them all three for a con.
</p>
<p>spiracy against the life of the said Kidden.
</p>
<p>On Friday the 30th of the same month, another bill of indict,
</p>
<p>ment was found by the ("i rand Jury of London, at the Old Bailey,
</p>
<p>against John Berry and Mary Jones, for wilful and corrupt per.
</p>
<p>jury on the trial of the said Joshua Kidden, (Mac Daniel was not
</p>
<p>on the trial), at the Sessions-house in the Old Bailey, when he was
</p>
<p>unjustly convicted solely on the most full and positive evidence of
</p>
<p>the said Berry and Jones, whose said testimonies were utterly
</p>
<p>false, and wilfully corrupt.
</p>
<p>The next evening the three prisoners were brought from New-
</p>
<p>gate to the bar at the Sessions. house in the Old Bailey, and severally
</p>
<p>arraigned on the said three indictments, to all which they pleaded
</p>
<p>Not Guilty; and then a motion was made in behalf of the prose.
</p>
<p>cution, that the prisoners trials thereon might be put off to the
</p>
<p>next Sessions, because the witnesses for the prosecution could
</p>
<p>not be present to give their testimonies till then ; whereupon it waa
</p>
<p>moved by counsel for Mary Jones, on the Habeas Corpus Act,
</p>
<p>that as she the said Mary Jones had been confined two sessions,

</p>
<p>and that as she had put in her prayer the first day of each sessions
</p>
<p>to be tried, bailed, or discharged, and the prosecutor not ready to
</p>
<p>go to trial on the indictment for the murder, she having beea
</p>
<p>charged only with the murder of Kidden before, that she was en-
</p>
<p>titled by law to be discharged from her confinement, on account of
</p>
<p>the said indictment for the murder ; and that they were ready to
</p>
<p>give bail for her appearance at the next sessions, to take her trial
</p>
<p>on the other two indictments, as they were bailable offences; and,
</p>
<p>on hearing counsel on both sides, the Court were of opinion, that
</p>
<p>for neglect of prosecuting her, she was entituled to be set at liberty
</p>
<p>in pursuance of the Habeas Corpus Act, on the charge of murder,
</p>
<p>but that they should expect undeniable bail for her appearance, to
</p>
<p>take her trial on the other two indictments next sessions, and accord,
</p>
<p>iogly she was left by order of Court for bail.
</p>
<p>The Court having given their opinion, the counsel for the Crown
</p>
<p>Ihen replied, that, if her person was to be discharged for neglect of
</p>
<p>prosecution, as soon as she was bailed for the other offences, they
</p>
<p>would immediately apprehend her on a warrant, as standing charged
</p>
<p>with the murder of Joshua Kidden, and not having taken her trial,
</p>
<p>by which she must by law be re-committed ; adding, that she could
</p>
<p>never be cleared of the crime till discharged by verdict of a jury.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, in June Sessions, 1756', in Alderman Bethell's
</p>
<p>mayoralty, Mac Daniel, Berry, and the female miscreant Mary
</p>
<p>Jones, were indicted for the wilful murder of Joshua Kidden, in ma-
</p>
<p>liciously causing him to be tried, convicted, and executed, well know-
</p>
<p>ing him to be innocent of the fact they laid to his charge, and with
</p>
<p>an intent to share to themselves the reward. They were convicted
</p>
<p>(DEATH) ; but, there being a doubt whether the facts proved
</p>
<p>against them amounted in law to murder, the Court immediately
</p>
<p>respited the judgment, in order that the point might be solemnly
</p>
<p>argued before the twelve judges, and the attorney-general dedin
</p>
<p>ing to argue the point of law,* the prisoners were, as to the in,
</p>
<p>dictmcn t for murder, at a subsequent sessions, discharged f
</p>
<p>* ' We have the authority of Mr. Justice Blackstone (4 Com. 196) for
</p>
<p>saying that the attorney-general did not decline arguing the point of law
</p>
<p>from any apprehension that it was not maintainable, but from other pru~
</p>
<p>deittial reasons; and therefore that nothing should be concluded from the
</p>
<p>waving of that prosecution. What the chief of those prudential reasons
</p>
<p>was, he alludes to in the same passage ; namely, to avoid the danger of
</p>
<p>deterring witnesses from giving evidence upon capital prosecutions, if it
</p>
<p>must be at the peril of their own lives. With respect to the offence, in
</p>
<p>foro conscientiae,' it is, without doubt, as aggravated a species of murder
</p>
<p>as any that can be conceived." East's PI. Cr. c. 5, s. 94. Mr. East
</p>
<p>subjoins, that he " has heard Lord Mansfield, C. J., make the same ob-
</p>
<p>servation (as Mr. Justice Blackstone), and say, that the opinions of
</p>
<p>several of the judges at that time, and his own, were strongly in support;
</p>
<p>of the indictment."
</p>
<p>Mr. Harrington, in his observations on the pillory, remarking on the
</p>
<p>infliction of that punishment on Egan and Salmon, says " the offence of
</p>
<p>these criminals was undoubtedly of the most atrocious nature ; nor do I

<p>see," saith he, " why they might not have been indicted for murder,
</p>
<p>notwithstanding Mr. Justice Foster hath, in his Reports, p. 132, intimated
</p>
<p>Ins opinion that such an indictment would not lie, and chiefly because
</p>
<p>there is no such precedent .'" It seems Sir Edward Coke informs us (
</p>
<p>Inst. 48), that " to procure the death of an innocent person, by giving
</p>
<p>false evidence against him, was not holdenfor murder in HIS time :" ergo,
</p>
<p>it cannot be murder in OURS ! Miserable trifling !
</p>
<p>By the ancient common law of England, it was held to be murder to
</p>
<p>bear false witness against another, with an express premeditated design to
</p>
<p>take away his life, so as the innocent person be condemned and executed.
</p>
<p>^Mirror, c. 1, s. 9, Brit. c. 52, Bract, lib. 3. c.4.
</p>
<p>** The doubt," says Judge Foster, " could not have arisen in any other
</p>
<p>country, where the Roman law is allowed to have any weight ; for by that
</p>
<p>law it is expressly declared, That witnesses, who by a false and malicious
</p>
<p>testimony procure an innocent man to be capitally condemned, shall be
</p>
<p>deemed guilty of murder. ' Quive falsum testimonium dolo inalo dixerit,

<p>quo quis publico judicio. rei capitalis damnaretur.' Digest, lib. 48,

</p>
<p>Frflm this result there is too much reason to fear, that the just
</p>
<p>indignation excited in the public mind produced that effect in cer-
</p>
<p>tain quarters which it seldom fails to do, when facts discover th
</p>
<p>rottenness of a system, or the cold-hearted indifference or neglect
</p>
<p>of its administrators.* At a time, therefore, when the country is
</p>
<p>once more disgraced by similar scenes of villainy, the public at-
</p>
<p>tention cannot be called too pointedly to this probability, or, finding
</p>
<p>it fact, be urged too strongly to watch against a repetition. It wiH
</p>
<p>scarcely be credited that the discoveries of 1756 produced no perma-
</p>
<p>nent alteration of the system with respect to rewards, although the
</p>
<p>journals of that year state that more than SEVENTY PERSONS
</p>
<p>* The reader's attention will be well bestowed upon the following argu-
</p>
<p>ment by an acute writer. " I have often reflected on the defective
</p>
<p>ADMINISTRATION of our laws, but never so much as since the affafr
</p>
<p>of the thief-takers. It is objected that they cannot he legally convicted
</p>
<p>of any crime hut PERJURY, though by that perjury they knowingly,
</p>
<p>deliberately, wilfully, and maliciously TOOK AWAY LIFE ; for, where there
</p>
<p>is no provocation to kill, malice is implied by the law. I will propose a
</p>
<p>parallel case the well-known fable of the Monkey, the Cat, and the
</p>
<p>Chesnuts, and ask, whether the monkey did not burn the cat wilfully and
</p>
<p>of malice aforethought? or whether he only feloniously stole the chesnuts,
</p>
<p>and burnt the cat as a means safely to perpetrate the theft? For my
</p>
<p>part, I think he did burn the cat wilfully and of malice aforethought. lie
</p>
<p>knew he could not have the chesnuts without making use of her paw, or
</p>
<p>running the hazard of burning himself. He determined, however, to have
</p>
<p>them without burning his own, therefore he determined to use the cat's
</p>
<p>paw; or, in other words, he wilfully and of malice aforethought intended
</p>
<p>and resolved to put the cat's paw in the fire, by which act he knew the
</p>
<p>cat's paw would be burnt. This act of barbarity was certainly a greater
</p>
<p>crime than the stealing of the fruit, and surely the cat had as much reason
</p>
<p>to seek redress as the owner of the chesnuts. Now the condemnation of
</p>
<p>the porter (Ridden) was the means which the thief-takers pitched upon to
</p>
<p>cheat the public of certain rewards. They did not choose to rob openly
</p>
<p>on the highway, or break into a house, and thus expose themselves to

<p>punishment, as the monkey did not choose to venture his own fingers;
</p>
<p>but they determined to gain the money without exposing themselves,
</p>
<p>therefore they determined to procure the porter's condemnation ; and, as
</p>
<p>the natural consequence of the monkey's putting the cat's paw into the
</p>
<p>fire was the burning it, so was the man's death the natural consequence
</p>
<p>of the condemnation they procured. Surely, then, they resolved, and
</p>
<p>intended wilfully, and of malice aforethought, to procure his death, as the
</p>
<p>only means by which they could safely rob the public. Their perjury on
</p>
<p>the trial, or their defrauding the public of a sum of money, is equal to the
</p>
<p>theft of the chesnuts. But the means they used, or their prosecuting the
</p>
<p>man to death, was, like the monkey's burning the cat, a determined,
</p>
<p>wilfuf, malicious act a separate act of murder, for which they ought to
</p>
<p>die. Had the cat sued the monkey before JEsop, her action would have
</p>
<p>been considered apart from the theft, and he would have received ade-
</p>
<p>quate punishment for his injury to her. Upon the whole, these wretcbe*
</p>
<p>evidently contrived the porter's death, and they sted lastly persevered in
</p>
<p>their horrid machinations, without the least remorse, till they executed
</p>
<p>him, under the sanction of the law. And shall those laws protect them?
</p>
<p>No : away with such detestable monsters ; cut them off quickly, as a
</p>
<p>satisfaction to their country and a reparation of her honour." Gent. Mag,
</p>
<p>f ol. 26, p. 295.

<p>so
</p>
<p>were convicted by the machinations of Mac Danief, Berry, and
</p>
<p>their gang, who received upwards of one thousand seven hundred
</p>
<p>-end twenty pounds FROM THE TREASURY /or BLOOD-
</p>
<p>MONEY. They further state, that previously to the sensation
</p>
<p>created by these trials, which partially impeded this species of
</p>
<p>humane and judicious encouragement, forty-fire persons were
</p>
<p>capitally convicted in one year, and that for tico years afterwards
</p>
<p>the condemned only amounted to fifteen. What do such facts
</p>
<p>prove with respect to the policy of this unqualified pecuniary
</p>
<p>incentive to conspiracy and perjury ? and more coupled with
</p>
<p>existing circumstances, -what a comment do they not form on the
</p>
<p>fulsome and ridiculous panegyric which has been so incessantly
</p>
<p>heaped on this order of men by the Bench and, by the bye, on
</p>
<p>few more than on the fellow whose criminality is now under inves-
</p>
<p>tigation ? Credit is doubtless due to active and undaunted indi-
</p>
<p>viduals of this class, and let their merit be appreciated in the
</p>
<p>proper quarter; but, for the honour of Christianity, let us be
</p>
<p>pared orations upon exertions which are rewarded exactly in
</p>
<p>proportion as they are made, and that too by a direct premium,
</p>
<p>on blood* The manner in which this is sometimes done resembles
</p>
<p>the patting of a terrier when it issues with ensanguined jaws from
</p>
<p>a rat-hole, and would be barely siifferable if reward were out of
</p>
<p>the question. Those who attend examinations must frequently
</p>
<p>observe the extreme licence assumed by police officers, and occa-
</p>
<p>sionally wonder at the implicit credit their unsupported testimony-
</p>
<p>receives. Some confidence must be put in them undoubtedly ;
</p>
<p>but the cases at present before the public ought to convince every
</p>
<p>unprejudiced person of the danger of implicitly trusting to men
</p>
<p>who receive FORTY POUNDS per head -for hanging other
</p>
<p>men. Without any great assumption of philosophy, and yet with
</p>
<p>all proper liberality, it may be asserted that thief-taking, as a
</p>
<p>profession, is not favourable to correct morals, and that an inti-
</p>
<p>mate acquaintance with the taken sometimes operates most injuri-
</p>
<p>ously on the taker not to mention the previous rank of life of

<p>the holy brotherhood, which neither is nor can be the best taught.
</p>
<p>All this bespeaks caution and reserve on the part of the magistracy;
</p>
<p>but unfortunately an acquaintance with the refuse of society
</p>
<p>sometimes affects them as much as their inferiors. There is a kind
</p>
<p>of slang aptitude observable occasionally both on the bench and
</p>
<p>the judgment-seat, which is a sure indication of the effect of evil
</p>
<p>communication ; and, what is worse, a " right worshipful" of this
</p>
<p>class is generally severe. He serves doubt as Alexander did the
</p>
<p>Gordian knot ; he cuts it and death ends all evils.
</p>
<p>But little would be the comparative utility of adverting to the
</p>
<p>past, to throw a light upon present villainy, if individuals only
</p>
<p>were blameable, and not the system. In referring to the monstrous
</p>
<p>murders of the gang of 1756, it should never be forgotten thar,
</p>
<p>in all human probability, the facts brought to light formed but a
</p>
<p>very small part of its infernal labours. Both before and after*
</p>
<p>31
</p>
<p>%irds the same machinery of rewards was in full motion ;* and
</p>
<p>every discovery, that of 1816 not excepted, has proved that the
</p>
<p>parties concerned were veterans in their line. \Vho can say how
</p>
<p>many innocent persons fell a prey to Berry and Co. of 1756?
</p>
<p>who determine the number of the victims of the conspirators of
</p>
<p>1816?+ Bad characters were certainly their most obvious prey ;
</p>
<p>but the murdered Kidden of the former band, and the poor con-
</p>
<p>victed Irishmen of the latter, prove the carelessness of these
</p>
<p>wretches as to the demerits of those whom they sacrificed for re-
</p>
<p>ward. And then, as to the actually bad, of what description were
</p>
<p>they ? the very worst by no means, but generally poor, igno-
</p>
<p>rant, and miserable pilferers, or small depredators, whom it was
</p>
<p>necessary to tempt into the commission of daring crime ! Indeed,
</p>
<p>the wretched plan of remuneration per head, and species of offence,
</p>
<p>must produce this mischief every way ; for, until guilty of sonic..
</p>
<p>thing CAPITAL, they are not worth apprehending, and thus
</p>
<p>PREVENTION is indirectly impeded. The slightest reflection
</p>
<p>will convince us that, with respect to connivance, the evil of
</p>
<p>remunerating by specific reward must be abundant. Allowing
</p>
<p>police officers to be every thing they are sometimes said to be,
</p>
<p>they cannot be expected to move so alertly without a pecuniary
</p>
<p>motive as with one ; and, not to make them Macdanicls or Berrys,
</p>
<p>is it uncharitable to infer that many among them may be indifferent
</p>
<p>to the detection of crimes which are short of price to the ap-
</p>
<p>prehension of criminals who do not weigh their weight!^.
</p>
<p>It must not be imagined that this account is edited with tha
</p>
<p>slightest wish of prejudicing the individuals now in custody.
</p>
<p>Where enormous guilt is alleged, the more calmly should the
</p>
<p>judgment be exercised on the circumstances tending to prove it;
</p>
<p>* It is hardly necessary to refer to the well-known labours of Jonathan
</p>
<p>Wild. The wretched villainy to which the system of specific reward
</p>
<p>formerly gave rise, is indeed unspeakable. Let any one refer to the novels
</p>
<p>of Fielding, particularly Amelia, and attend to the scenes described bj
</p>

<p>equally severe ; as witness the apprehension of poor Humphrey Clinker.
</p>
<p>These were only fictions, it will he said : true ; but they are the fictions
</p>
<p>of men whose knowledge of existing society was undeniable; and novels,
</p>
<p>says Lady M. W. Montague, always convey the received sentiments of
</p>
<p>their day.

<p>t Should any other person be enabled to ascertain "the fate of the wretch
</p>
<p>Mary Jones, and will convey particulars to the publisher, it shall be no-
</p>
<p>ticed in a second edition. It will be recollected that Euan was killed in
</p>
<p>the pillory. On the 26th February, 1762, Berry died in Newgate of eating
</p>
<p>muscles. The year afterwards, Mac Daniel got himself sent as a
</p>
<p>soldier to the Indies for life. Salmon, it is believed, died in Newgate
</p>
<p>before Berry. But further precise information respecting tbem will be
</p>
<p>acceptable to W. Hone, 55, Fleet-street.
</p>
<p>J And who, it may be added, can say how many fell victims to simitar
</p>
<p>iniquity, which has never been discovered ? A complete understanding
</p>
<p>seems to have existed among the thief-takers of 1756; *-eie these alone
</p>
<p>guilty who were apprehended? See what Spanish Jack said of the thie
</p>
<p>takers then in Newgate, as well as of those at liberty ! (p. 9, note.)

</p>
<p>but it Is quite evident that too much attention cannot le paid to the
</p>
<p>iases now before the public, and that a reference to a miserable
</p>
<p>faliing-offin substantial justice on a former occasion may operate
</p>

</p>
<p>more -it may move enlightened and powerful individuals to inves-

<p>employed law to murder innocence, and produced instances of

<p>demoniacal wickedness disgraceful to the age and country in which
</p>
<p>they occur an investigation which, to be serviceable, must not
</p>
<p>attend for a moment to round assurances or certificates of cha-
</p>
<p>racter, which, on the detection of erery species of low oppression
</p>
<p>or tyranny, is sure to be obtained. Magistrates absolutely certi-
</p>
<p>fied the merits of Macdaniel and Berry in the public prints of
</p>
<p>their day, when first taken up ;J and it is now very well known
</p>
<p>that, when light breaks in upon the evil deeds of men of their
</p>
<p>stamp, it is the interest of many to stop up the gap. Hence,
</p>
<p>with great truth, a writer on the homicide of Egan, in a most
</p>
<p>respectable publication of that day, enumerates amongst the causes
</p>
<p>which generate such monsters " the ENCOURAGEMENT given
</p>
<p>to THIEF-TAKERS who will never want the character of use-
</p>
<p>ful and good-spirited men from fellows but ONE degree above
</p>
<p>t/iemselves"
</p>
<p>* It is impossible to deny the necessity of precise definition in criminal
</p>
<p>few, or that the guilty should have the benefit of the omission ; but, in the
</p>
<p>abstract, it is impossible not to smile with bitterness at the idea of a dozen
</p>
<p>men in large wigs assembling to decide whether falsely swearing a man to
</p>
<p>the gallows for 40). is murder, and gravely declaring No! it is a picture
</p>
<p>for Gulliver! It is no palliation to say, that the miscreants endured worse
</p>
<p>than death in the pillory that was in spite of law ; and the woman Jones
</p>
<p>apparently escaped all.
</p>
<p>f Just as this was going to press, the publisher was favoured, by an
</p>
<p>intelligent friend, with the following extract from the Gent. Magazine.'
</p>
<p>" May 14, 1785. The grand jury for Middlesex found a bill of indictment
</p>
<p>against John Lockrell and a constable) his accomplice, for perjury, having

</p>
<p>sworn against two men, Peter Newberry and William Iveson, both capi-
</p>
<p>tally convicted and included in the dead-warrant, but since found innocent,
</p>
<p>on the fullest enquiry, and sworn against only to obtain the reward.
</p>
<p>What punishment can be adequate to such an offence ?" Mr. Urban, by
</p>
<p>reference to former volumes of his excellent Miscellany, might have pro-
</p>
<p>fitably engaged the attention of his readers.
</p>
<p>J In public advertisement they styled them very honest fellows, and
</p>
<p>men who hazarded their lives for the good of t/teir country ! (See p. 7).
</p>
<p>It is not very extraordinary that at that period, when the police was
</p>
<p>under very bad management, and trading justice was in full custom, many
</p>
<p>of its retainers, who were criminals, should escape. They could better
</p>
<p>spare better men, upon the very principle that a bed-ridden weaver in
</p>
<p>New England was hanged for the murder of an Indian, committed by a
</p>
<p>preaching cobler. The Indians insisted that the murderer should be
</p>
<p>tanged ; but, as they did not know his person, the New England people
</p>
<p>thought it much better to hang up the bed-ridden weaver than the offender,
</p>
<p>" who," says th* narrator, " was a useful man among them, by acting in
</p>
<p>the double capacity of preaching and cobling.'' Gent. Mag. vol, 7 r
