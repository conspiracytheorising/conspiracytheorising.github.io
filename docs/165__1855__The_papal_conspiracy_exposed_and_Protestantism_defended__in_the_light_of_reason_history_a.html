<p>FRIENDLY CONSIDERATIONS FOR AMERICAN
</p>
<p>PROTESTANTS AND FREEMEN.
</p>
<p>GOD, my fellow-countrymen, has conferred on you the peculiar
</p>
<p>honor and the eminent responsibility of being jurors in behalf of
</p>
<p>the great commonwealth of humanity in a momentous case in
</p>
<p>which he himself is Judge.
</p>
<p>The great criminal arraigned for trial before his bar is that pecu-
</p>
<p>liar corporation claiming the right to be called the church of Rome.
</p>
<p>You are called on to decide whether this corporation, for treason
</p>
<p>against God and hostility to the human race, deserves the execra-
</p>
<p>tion of mankind and the righteous and avenging judgment of God.
</p>
<p>In order to decide this question, you are to consider, not any
</p>
<p>plausible professions which the corporation may put forth, but the
</p>
<p>organic laws of the corporation, its avowed principles, the inevitable
</p>
<p>tendency of such laws and principles, and finally the actual results
</p>
<p>of these tendencies as imbodied in history. When you have in-
</p>
<p>telligently considered these things, you will be able to decide wha
</p>
<p>this corporation is and what ought to be its doom.
</p>
<p>You are therefore called on also to decide whether this corpora-
</p>
<p>tion has changed for the better or not since its principles were fully
</p>
<p>developed during the era or dispensation of their notorious head,
</p>
<p>Gregory VII., sometimes called Hildebrand; whether the lion's
</p>
<p>claws that it then had have been extracted, or only concealed;

</p>
<p>4 FRIENDLY CONSIDERATIONS
</p>
<p>whether its teeth have been knocked out, or only hidden till it
</p>
<p>can find another opportunity to bite and devour. On these points
</p>
<p>some of the orators of the corporation have made most beautiful
</p>
<p>and touching appeals, protesting that in these auspicious days of
</p>
<p>liberality the lion has laid aside its ancient ferocity and repented
</p>
<p>of its bloody deeds, and is ready to lie down with the lamb, and the
</p>
<p>leopard with the kid, and that a little child can lead them. 5fou,
</p>
<p>as good men and true, are called upon to say upon your oaths
</p>
<p>whether you find that there is any evidence that this blessed trans-
</p>
<p>formation has taken place.
</p>
<p>Indeed, in coming to your ultimate results, you are called on to
</p>
<p>decide a still more important question that is to say, What is the
</p>
<p>character of this corporation for truth and fidelity to engagements ?
</p>
<p>You are called on to decide whether it is ever safe to trust any af-
</p>
<p>firmations or denials of this corporation, or of any of its agents, as
</p>
<p>to any matters of fact touching their own interests or involved in
</p>
<p>their own defence.
</p>
<p>You are therefore called on to decide, first, What has been the
</p>
<p>character of this corporation in these respects in ages past ? And
</p>
<p>if you find that it has been infamous to the last degree, then you
</p>
<p>are to decide whether it has ever repented and brought forth works
</p>
<p>meet for repentance, so as at last to deserve to be admitted into
</p>
<p>decent, civilized, and Christian society.
</p>
<p>Not merely in ages past, but also at the present day, this corpora-
</p>
<p>tion has promulgated certain bills of rights designed to define the
</p>
<p>extent of their own claims and prerogatives. These may, by way of
</p>
<p>distinction, be called the Papal bills of rights. On these you are
</p>
<p>also called to sit in judgment. The amount of them in brief is
</p>
<p>this : This Papal corporation have avowed a conscientious convic-
</p>
<p>tion that God has empowered them to do all the thinking of all
</p>
<p>mankind on all points of Christian faith and practice, and that he
</p>
<p>has retired all the rest of mankind to think as this corporation

</p>
<p>thinks, on pain of eternal damnation ; also that God has given them
</p>
<p>FOR AMERICAN PROTESTANTS AND FREEMEN. 5
</p>
<p>full power over kings and all rulers, to use them as instruments in
</p>
<p>enforcing this right, by crusades, confiscations, proscriptions, and
</p>
<p>boundless slaughters. Such are their avowed and conscientious
</p>
<p>convictions on these important and interesting topics.
</p>
<p>Their ideas of their own rights of conscience correspond ; that
</p>
<p>is to say, they claim the right to act out these conscientious convic-
</p>
<p>tions without let or impediment. This is in brief the bill of Papal
</p>
<p>rights of conscience.
</p>
<p>Their ideas of the rights of conscience in all others are no less
</p>
<p>interesting and instructive. They liberally concede to all mankind
</p>
<p>the right to obey such laws and decisions of all sorts as they shall
</p>
<p>declare that God has promulgated through themselves, and none
</p>
<p>others in contravention of these. In short, their theory of the rights
</p>
<p>of man is in brief this : That all mankind have an inalienable right
</p>
<p>to obey the laws of the Papal corporation, and that all who refuse to
</p>
<p>obey these laws have no other rights whatever.
</p>
<p>The doctrines of this corporation on the subject of persecution are
</p>
<p>no less instructive. They are these :
</p>
<p>Inasmuch as God has given to them the rights of conscience above
</p>
<p>stated, it is not persecution in them to carry those rights into full
</p>
<p>and perfect effect, by deposing rebellious kings and rulers, and by
</p>
<p>using such rulers as are obedient to them, in the laudable and divine
</p>
<p>work of torturing, and then butchering or burning, all rebels against
</p>
<p>Papal authority, confiscating their goods, and rendering them and
</p>
<p>their children infamous forever. For the Papal corporation to do
</p>
<p>all this is not persecution, but the exercise of just authority.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if any man shall have the hardihood and
</p>
<p>audacity even secretly to think that this is wrong, and much more to
</p>
<p>say so, that man is a persecutor. Much more is he a persecutor if
</p>
<p>he shall dare to endeavor to create a public sentiment that shall
</p>
<p>throw infamy upon the corporation simply because they have exer-
</p>
<p>cised their just rights of conscience in butchering a few millions of
</p>
<p>heretics say, for example, about fifty millions, more or less.

<p>6 FRIENDLY CONSIDERATIONS
</p>
<p>Still more, it would be inexcusable persecution for this nation to
</p>
<p>pass any laws to prevent them from gaining, as soon as possible, the
</p>
<p>ability to carry out their rights of conscience aforesaid in this country.
</p>
<p>In particular, if the head of the corporation shall send to this
</p>
<p>country pecuniary agents, whom, he sees fit to call bishops, and to
</p>
<p>concentrate in them all the property of all the religious societies in
</p>
<p>this land who own his sway, as one means of gaining the power at
</p>
<p>which he aims, then to interpose by law to prohibit and prevent
</p>
<p>such accumulation would be a still higher grade of persecution.
</p>
<p>Above all, to expel by law from this land the sworn pecuniary
</p>
<p>agents of the foreign head of this corporation, even although they
</p>
<p>should be manifestly, and openly, and undeniably guilty of a treason-
</p>
<p>able conspiracy with foreign Romish powers to subvert the consti-
</p>
<p>tution and laws of these United States and of each particular state
</p>
<p>in this confederacy, would be the summit of persecution. This is
</p>
<p>self-evident ; because any government that refuses to submit to the
</p>
<p>jurisdiction of this corporation has no right to exist, and therefore it
</p>
<p>is a duty to conspire to overthrow it. Indeed it is the conscientious
</p>
<p>conviction of the members of this corporation that they are called
</p>
<p>on, AS SOON AS THEY CAN GET THE POWER, to rule all such govern-
</p>
<p>ments with a rod of iron and to dash them in pieces like a potter's
</p>
<p>vessel.
</p>
<p>That these are the present claims of this corporation, without col-
</p>
<p>oring or exaggeration, I think you will be satisfied when you shall
</p>
<p>have read the evidence adduced in this volume, which is but a
</p>
<p>small part of what could be offered.
</p>
<p>I will, however, in this place present one item more, which I re-
</p>
<p>quest you to consider in connection with that in the body of this
</p>
<p>work.
</p>
<p>Pope Pius VII., whose papacy occupied nearly the first quarter
</p>
<p>of the present century, gave to his nuncio at Vienna the following
</p>
<p>instructions, in view of the claims of certain Protestant princes on

</p>
<p>his ecclesiastical property in Germany for indemnity for certain
</p>
<p>FOR AMERICAN PROTESTANTS AND FREEMEN. 7
</p>
<p>injuries. He says, " Not only has the church succeeded to prevent
</p>
<p>heretics from possessing themselves of ecclesiastical property, but
</p>
<p>she has established the confiscation and the loss of goods as the
</p>
<p>punishment of those guilty of the crime of heresy. This punish-
</p>
<p>ment, as it respects the goods of individuals, is decreed by a bull
</p>
<p>of Innocent III. ; and, in respect of principalities and fiefs, it is a
</p>
<p>rule of the canon law (Chap. Absolutes xvi., De Hsereticis) that the
</p>
<p>subjects of an heretical prince are enfranchised from every duty to-
</p>
<p>wards him and dispensed from all fealty and homage. However
</p>
<p>slightly one may be versed in history, he cannot but know that sen-
</p>
<p>tences of deposition have been pronounced by pontiffs and by
</p>
<p>councils against princes guilty of heresy. Indeed we have fallen
</p>
<p>upon such calamitous times, times of such humiliation to the
</p>
<p>spouse of Jesus Christ, (!) that it is not possible for her to practise
</p>
<p>nor expedient to invoke HER MOST SACRED MAXIMS OF JUST RIGOR
</p>
<p>against the enemies and rebels of the faith. But, if she cannot
</p>
<p>exercise HER RIGHT of deposing heretics from their principalities
</p>
<p>and of declaring their goods forfeited, can she ever positively per-
</p>
<p>mit herself to be despoiled to add to them new principalities and new
</p>
<p>goods ? What occasion of deriding the church would not be given
</p>
<p>to the heretics and unbelievers themselves, who, insulting over her
</p>
<p>grief, would say that means at length had been found out TO MAKE
</p>
<p>HER TOLERANT ! " Such are the doctrines of this corporation in the
</p>
<p>nineteenth century.
</p>
<p>This interesting document was obtained by M. Daunou from the
</p>
<p>archives of the Vatican when they were removed by Bonaparte to
</p>
<p>Paris, and were by the government committed to him for custody.
</p>
<p>The Italian original may be found in the second volume of his able
</p>
<p>History of the Court of Rome. This invaluable work every Ameri-
</p>
<p>can ought to study, though its author is a lay Romanist. Of him I
</p>
<p>have said more in another part of my work.
</p>
<p>In the light of this equitable document, we see clearly that the

<p>Romish church, so called, is under no obligation to make any com-
</p>
<p>8 FRIENDLY CONSIDERATIONS
</p>
<p>pensation to Protestants for any injuries -whatever in the shape, for
</p>
<p>example, of deposition, confiscation, plunder, murder, &c. ; for it is
</p>
<p>HER RIGHT to do such things to heretics, and her MOST SACRED
</p>
<p>MAXIMS OF JUST RIGOR require her to do them, whenever she can
</p>
<p>But how is it with regard to Protestants ? Even thus : If a mob,
</p>
<p>without violence to life, happens to burn a single convent, then THE
</p>
<p>STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS is to be held up to eternal infamy by the
</p>
<p>pope, and all his pecuniary agents called bishops, if she refuses to
</p>
<p>make restitution to the Romish corporation to the uttermost farthing.
</p>
<p>Accordingly the Papal corporation never has made any restitution,
</p>
<p>and intends never to make any restitution, for cities sacked, churches
</p>
<p>burned, families plundered of their all, husbands and wives, parents
</p>
<p>and children, tortured and butchered by it with the most savage
</p>
<p>ferocity. The MOST SACRED MAXIMS OF JUST RIGOR established
</p>
<p>by that corporation authorize and demand all these things ; for it is
</p>
<p>self-evident that rebels against this corporation have no rights. But,
</p>
<p>if this state shall not make full restitution for property which they
</p>
<p>did not destroy, human language cannot utter the infamy and the
</p>
<p>deep damnation that this corporation will assign to all her Protestant
</p>
<p>citizens for such atrocious persecution.
</p>
<p>Moreover from this document it appears that this gentle spouse
</p>
<p>of Christ is dissolved in grief in view of the present calamitous times,
</p>
<p>which prevent her from fully exercising her just rights of confiscation
</p>
<p>and murder, and regards the very supposition by the heretics that
</p>
<p>any means can possibly be founfl out sufficiently powerful TO MAKE
</p>
<p>HER TOLERANT an insult over her grief.
</p>
<p>What heart can be so hard as not to be touched with sympathetic
</p>
<p>sorrow in view of such deep grief of this most interesting and affec-
</p>
<p>tionate corporation ?
</p>
<p>That the present pope, Pius IX., fully sympathizes with these
</p>
<p>views, is plain from his brief dated June 10, 1851, in condemnation
</p>
<p>of Francis G. Vigil, of Lima, Peru, which I have not room to quote,

<p>and from his allocution to the cardinals of the church, delivered
</p>
<p>FOR AMERICAN PROTESTANTS AND FREEMEN. 9
</p>
<p>September, 1851, in which, he says that "he hath taken this prin-
</p>
<p>ciple for basis, that the Catholic religion, with all its rights, ought to be
</p>
<p>exclusively dominant in such sort that every other worship shall be
</p>
<p>banislied and interdicted." Well then may he, as he does, unite with
</p>
<p>his bishops in this country in applauding 0. A. Brownson's maga-
</p>
<p>zine. Moreover I shall show in my work that the doctrines which
</p>
<p>I have just stated are an essential part of the constitutional law of
</p>
<p>this corporation, and that they are at this day taught and defended by
</p>
<p>Mr. Brownson and sanctioned by the Bishops of Rome at present
</p>
<p>sojourning in these United States.
</p>
<p>On these principles, then, you are called by the providence of
</p>
<p>God to sit in judgment, and to decide whether the principles of our
</p>
<p>government were designed to defend such rights of such consciences
</p>
<p>and to protect and establish the claims and authority of such a cor-
</p>
<p>poration.
</p>
<p>You are also called to sit in judgment upon the influence of the
</p>
<p>corporation putting forth such claims upon all the religious, civil,
</p>
<p>and social interests of the community in ages past and at this day.
</p>
<p>Especially are you called onto decide upon the influence of the celi-
</p>
<p>bacy of the clergy in connection with the confessional, and also of the
</p>
<p>whole system of monasteries and nunneries established in this land.
</p>
<p>No other subject more deeply affects the interests of the future mil
</p>
<p>lions of this continent, which God has given in trust to you.
</p>
<p>You are also called upon to consider upon what grounds the mem
</p>
<p>bers of this corporation base their claims to such prerogatives and
</p>
<p>rights as they arrogate to themselves ; whether they have, indeed,
</p>
<p>a divine warrant for them, or whether they are based upon a foun-
</p>
<p>dation of forgeries and frauds as atrocious as their claims are all-
</p>
<p>comprehending and exclusive.
</p>
<p>My object in this volume is to furnish you with some authentic
</p>
<p>evidence for your careful consideration in forming your judgment
</p>
<p>on all these momentous questions.

<p>nation. The evidence which I adduce is derived from their pages.
</p>
<p>The foundations of this corporation I have examined and the process
</p>
<p>of its formation. I have given an historical view of the deeds of
</p>
<p>three of its leading master builders one of them the patron saint
</p>
<p>of the Romish bishops residing in these United States.
</p>
<p>I have also considered its influence in the period of its greatest
</p>
<p>power and most perfect development, and also from that day to this.
</p>
<p>Its true character is developed in its history and in the word of
</p>
<p>God.
</p>
<p>To this course of historical investigation, as well as to all the
</p>
<p>other evidence, I ask your careful attention. Remember that you

<p>are judges with God in the greatest case of all ages a case radi-

<p>INTRODUCTION.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER I.
</p>
<p>THE CASE STATED AND THE ISSUE DEFINED.
</p>
<p>THE Pilgrim Fathers of New England and the other
</p>
<p>Protestant founders of this great nation came to this
</p>
<p>continent, soon after the reformation had shaken the Eu-
</p>
<p>ropean world, to lay the foundations of a new order of
</p>
<p>things, by erecting a new social system upon the great
</p>
<p>principles of civil and religious liberty.
</p>
<p>As one illustration of the results of this colonization,
</p>
<p>we now witness in New England a state of society which,
</p>
<p>with all its defects, has never been exceeded, and rarely
</p>
<p>equalled, on earth. Our state of society, too, is the result
</p>
<p>of the principles and institutions of our fathers. It was
</p>
<p>their glory, in their own esteem, that they had receded to
</p>
<p>the uttermost point from the corruptions and pollutions
</p>
<p>of Rome in doctrine, organization, and morals. Their

<p>14 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>foundation was the Bible, and the Bible alone not the
</p>
<p>Bible neutralized or rendered poisonous by the traditions
</p>
<p>of man ; the Bible in the hands of the churches and of
</p>
<p>the people, and not in the hands of a hierarchy falsely
</p>
<p>calling herself the church. Under it have sprung up free
</p>
<p>governments in church and -state, systems of education,
</p>
<p>purity in the family state, regenerated ministers and
</p>
<p>churches, benevolent enterprise, science, literature, and
</p>
<p>the arts.
</p>
<p>Results similar to these are also extensively witnessed
</p>
<p>throughout our land ; and it is our fixed purpose, by the
</p>
<p>aid of God, to make them universal. At this we aim;
</p>
<p>because it is our firm conviction that we, as a Protestant
</p>
<p>nation, have received our principles from God, and that
</p>
<p>he has assigned to us the sublime mission and the glorious
</p>
<p>destiny of making them universal.
</p>
<p>But lo, whilst we are obediently moving on to attain
</p>
<p>our destiny, an assault is made upon us by a system unique
</p>
<p>and peculiar, and assuming the style and title of the
</p>
<p>Church of Rome, the Mother and Mistress of all churches.
</p>
<p>We turn to listen to her words. They are bold and
</p>
<p>lofty. Laying aside all ceremony, she at once denounces
</p>
<p>us and our fathers as in rebellion against her, our only
</p>
<p>lawful and religious sovereign, and therefore against
</p>
<p>Almighty God himself.
</p>
<p>We stop to consider more particularly the system which
</p>
<p>makes such charges and puts forth such pretensions.
</p>
<p>We find it to be a system nominally Christian, yet not
</p>
<p>friendly to other Christian bodies, but excluding and
</p>
<p>anathematizing them all. It is confined to no nation or
</p>
<p>government, but exists under all. Its parts in various
</p>
<p>nations are not, like other religious bodies, independent of
</p>
<p>each other, but are all organized as one compact system

</p>
<p>around one head. That head is a temporal ruler in a
</p>
<p>THE CASE STATED AND THE ISSUE DEFINED. 15
</p>
<p>territory exclusively his own. He is also a spiritual
</p>
<p>ruler, and to some extent a temporal ruler, over his sub-
</p>
<p>jects in all lands. He claims supremacy oyer all earthly
</p>
<p>governments ; and, so far as he has had at any time the
</p>
<p>ability, has exercised this supremacy, and at all times
</p>
<p>aims to secure the requisite power.
</p>
<p>In our land the system has great and constantly in-
</p>
<p>creasing numbers. Seven archbishops, thirty-two bishops,
</p>
<p>one thousand five hundred and seventy-four priests, and a
</p>
<p>population of three millions are subjected to its sway.
</p>
<p>It has exerted great power in politics. Politicians
</p>
<p>have courted the favor of those who sway this mass of
</p>
<p>voters. It has also constantly aimed, through pecuniary
</p>
<p>and political motives, to paralyze and control the Protes-
</p>
<p>tant political and secular press.
</p>
<p>It has under its control numerous and dangerous or-
</p>
<p>ganized societies, composed of unmarried men and women
</p>
<p>withdrawn from domestic life, and specially sworn to ex-
</p>
<p>tend and defend the authority of the Pope of Rome, the
</p>
<p>head of the great system.
</p>
<p>It is organizing seductive and proselyting systems of
</p>
<p>education, and aims by means of them to corrupt and en-
</p>
<p>list in their vast schemes the children of Protestant par-
</p>
<p>ents. It has at this time twenty colleges, with two thou-
</p>
<p>sand two hundred and forty-seven students ; twenty-nine
</p>
<p>theological seminaries, with upwards of four hundred
</p>
<p>students ; and one hundred and twelve female academies.
</p>
<p>It is accumulating property and aiming to concentrate
</p>
<p>it in the hands of the bishops the sworn vassals of a for-
</p>
<p>eign monarch. It meets us at every turn in this and in all
</p>
<p>lands. It shows its true spirit as fast as it gains power ;
</p>
<p>and it significantly threatens us with future retribution

</p>
<p>whenever it shall gain universal sway.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER II.
</p>
<p>ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE SPIRIT AND AIMS OF POPERY.
</p>
<p>WE will illustrate these statements by a few impressive
</p>
<p>facts. It has ever been the policy of the Papists to charge
</p>
<p>on Protestants a tendency to all kinds of radical and dis-
</p>
<p>organizing errors, and to assert that the only defence
</p>
<p>against it is submission to the Papacy. "Whenever such ten-
</p>
<p>dencies appear to exist in fact, the Papists are emboldened
</p>
<p>to endeavor to produce a reaction towards their system.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, when signs of such a state of things began to
</p>
<p>appear in New England, they put forth new efforts to
</p>
<p>make proselytes ; nor were those efforts entirely fruitless.
</p>
<p>In particular, one well-known personage, of New Eng-
</p>
<p>land parentage and education, Orestes A. Brownson, who
</p>
<p>had himself neared the gulf of infidelity and atheism, un-
</p>
<p>able to extricate himself from the mazes of scepticism, fled
</p>
<p>for refuge to Rome, and now pronounces the experiment
</p>
<p>of our fathers a failure, and calls on us to return from our
</p>
<p>revolt. Thus, in this centre of New England, this bold
</p>
<p>proposal is made by a descendant of the Puritans to the
</p>
<p>American mind. Our system is pronounced a failure.
</p>
<p>Romanism is offered to us in its place ; yea, urged upon
</p>
<p>us as our only refuge from ruin.
</p>
<p>Listen to the following words, in which he discloses
</p>
<p>not only his own feelings, but also the purposes of the
</p>
<p>Papal corporation:

</p>
<p>" The church may be assailed, will be assailed : but we
</p>
<p>know it is founded on a rock ; and the gates of hell shall
</p>
<p>not prevail against it. It is now firmly established in
</p>
<p>this country ; and persecution will but cause it to thrive.
</p>
<p>Our countrymen may be grieved that it is so ; but it is
</p>
<p>useless for them to kick against the decrees of Almighty
</p>
<p>God. They have had an open field and fair play for
</p>
<p>Protestantism. Here Protestantism has had free scope,
</p>
<p>has reigned without a rival, and proved what she could
</p>
<p>do, and that her best is evil ; for the very good she boasts
</p>
<p>is not hers. A new day is dawning on this chosen land ; a
</p>
<p>new chapter is about to open in our history, and the church
</p>
<p>to assume her rightful position and influence. Ours shall
</p>
<p>yet become consecrated ground ; and here the kingdom
</p>
<p>of God's dear Son shall be established. Our hills and
</p>
<p>valleys shall yet echo to the convent bell. No matter
</p>
<p>who writes, who declaims, who intrigues, who is alarmed,
</p>
<p>or what leagues are formed ; this is to be a Catholic coun-
</p>
<p>try ; and from Maine to Georgia, from the broad Atlantic
</p>
<p>to the broader Pacific, the clean sacrifice is to be offered
</p>
<p>daily for the quick and the dead."
</p>
<p>But these words are not original with him ; they are
</p>
<p>but an echo of the voice of the church. The society at
</p>
<p>Lyons for the propagation of the faith, a Papal organiza-
</p>
<p>tion of great power, to which I shall hereafter recur
</p>
<p>again, says the same. Speaking of the discovery of
</p>
<p>America by Columbus, and of the fact that France
</p>
<p>and Spain took possession for the church, the society
</p>
<p>says,
</p>
<p>" At a late hour heresy made her appearance, and led
</p>
<p>to the coasts of North America the most violent of her
</p>
<p>disciples the restless Puritans. Soon other sects cast

<p>their scum on the same shores, and Protestantism gained

<p>18 THE PAPAL CONSPIEACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>sovereignty in the thirteen colonies -which were destined
</p>
<p>to become the United States. Yet the Catholic church
</p>
<p>could never abandon THE INVADED TERRITORY."
</p>
<p>After unfolding her plans and her vigorous prosecution
</p>
<p>of them, she says,
</p>
<p>" In view of such beneficial results, we may well believe
</p>
<p>that the creation of the American episcopate will rank
</p>
<p>as one of the most important events in the ecclesiastical
</p>
<p>history of the nineteenth century. Its efficacious activity
</p>
<p>recalls to mind something of those labors of organi-
</p>
<p>zation by which the illustrious bishops of primitive times,
</p>
<p>among the depraved Romans, the Arians, and the bar-
</p>
<p>barians, provided for the future welfare of modern
</p>
<p>nations."
</p>
<p>Nay, Mr. B. openly confesses that there is a system de-
</p>
<p>signed to exterminate Protestantism: "Not by force," he
</p>
<p>says, " but by argument and conviction. The church," he
</p>
<p>says, " never uses force." Just as true as this has been, so
</p>
<p>true will it be when they gain the power. We see the parts,
</p>
<p>therefore, of a universal system ; and they agree with the
</p>
<p>declaration of the Duke of Eichmond. He, as is well
</p>
<p>known, declared that there was a combination of the
</p>
<p>despots of the old world to destroy our institutions in
</p>
<p>order to sustain their own. This and other statements
</p>
<p>of a similar kind will be fully detailed in the succeeding
</p>
<p>portions of this work. Let no man, then, call it illiberali-
</p>
<p>ty or persecution if we subject this arrogant and in-
</p>
<p>vading system to a thorough scrutiny. We are still the
</p>
<p>majority. We have liberty and a free press; and God
</p>
<p>has raised us up, given us the power, and calls us to the
</p>
<p>work. Yet I desire to say, in passing, that my confidence
</p>
<p>of success does not rest on man. There is no sufficient

</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.
</p>
<p>THE CENTRAL POWER OF POPERY.
</p>
<p>So long as men admit the being of a God and believe
</p>
<p>in the immortality of the soul, their most powerful motives
</p>
<p>will be derived from their hopes and fears as to eternal
</p>
<p>life. It matters not whether these hopes or fears are
</p>
<p>founded on truth or falsehood, genuine religion or super-
</p>
<p>stition ; so long as they exist they will sway the masses
</p>
<p>of mankind with resistless power. The sway of Popery
</p>
<p>over the popular mind is derived from this source. It all
</p>
<p>depends upon a false answer to the question, " What shall
</p>
<p>I do to be saved ? "
</p>
<p>The sublimity and importance of the ideas called up
</p>
<p>before the mind by this brief question I suppose no one
</p>
<p>will deny. It calls up God ; a spiritual world ; a moral
</p>
<p>government ; a law and its penalty ; a revolt ; an atone-
</p>
<p>ment ; reconciliation to God, resulting in heaven ; eternal
</p>
<p>alienation, resulting in hell. But what has it to do with
</p>
<p>the central error of Romanism and the main issue be-
</p>
<p>tween Romanists and Protestants ? Much every way, as
</p>
<p>I shall soon show.
</p>
<p>The answer to this question given by the great re-
</p>
<p>formers is plain and distinct. It unfolds God, the correla-
</p>
<p>tion of the mind to him, the nature of his law, and of life
</p>
<p>in him by love, and shows that this perfects the mind and
</p>
<p>conducts it to its true end. It unfolds sin in its nature,

<p>(20)
</p>
<p>THE CENTRAL POWER OF POPERY. 21
</p>
<p>forms, and effects upon the mind its guilt, and desert,
</p>
<p>and eternal consequences. It unfolds the divinity and
</p>
<p>incarnation of the Son of God and his atonement, and the
</p>
<p>possibility of pardon on the ground of repentance, faith,
</p>
<p>and a holy life. And then, with the apostles, it says,
</p>
<p>" Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved."
</p>
<p>This is the answer of the whole evangelical Protestant
</p>
<p>world. In this they all agree. "With them the church
</p>
<p>of Rome does not agree. Teaching a hell, she admits the
</p>
<p>need of the question, but answers it falsely. Her answer
</p>
<p>is, Believe in the church of Rome, and in Christ as the
</p>
<p>church of Rome believes in him, and thou shalt be saved ;
</p>
<p>believe not, and thou shalt be damned.
</p>
<p>But you reply, I have had the Bible from childhood ; I
</p>
<p>have studied it ; I have been aided in my study by the
</p>
<p>instruction of holy men ; I think I know what sin is, and
</p>
<p>that I have repented of it, and trusted in Christ, and am
</p>
<p>striving to cultivate all the Christian graces and to lead
</p>
<p>a holy life ; and through the mercy of God, through Christ,
</p>
<p>I hope for heaven. Are not my hopes well founded ? But
</p>
<p>do you believe in the church of Rome ? No ; I believe in
</p>
<p>the Bible. But do you believe in the Bible in her sense
</p>
<p>and according to her interpretation ? In some things I
</p>
<p>do, and in some I do not. In a great multitude of things I
</p>
<p>regard her as utterly misinterpreting and radically cor-
</p>
<p>rupting the word of God ; and, on the whole, I regard that
</p>
<p>church as the man of sin spoken of by Paul and the great
</p>
<p>harlot spoken of by John. Then of course you cannot be
</p>
<p>saved ; since you not only do not believe in the church of
</p>
<p>Rome, but blaspheme her the bride, the spouse, of
</p>
<p>Christ. But where has God told me to believe in the
</p>
<p>church of Rome ? My Bible says nothing about it. It
</p>
<p>says, " Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be

</p>
<p>saved." And Paul, in his letter to the church of Rome,
</p>
<p>22 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>says, " Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall
</p>
<p>be saved ; " but not a syllable about believing in the church
</p>
<p>of Rome any where.
</p>
<p>Now, what has the church of Home to say to" all this,
</p>
<p>think you ? Why, as follows :
</p>
<p>1. You cannot tell what the canon of the Bible is ex-
</p>
<p>cept through the church of Rome.
</p>
<p>2. After the canon is made out, you cannot so tell what
</p>
<p>the Bible means, without the aid of the church of Rome,
</p>
<p>that it is possible for you to exercise saving faith.
</p>
<p>3. The Bible, without the traditions of the church of
</p>
<p>Rome, is so defective and imperfect that it is not safe to
</p>
<p>depend upon it.
</p>
<p>4. There is only one thing upon which you can depend
</p>
<p>safely; and that is the church of Rome. Through her you
</p>
<p>can tell what the canon of the Bible is ; through her you
</p>
<p>can tell what it means ; through her you can have all its
</p>

</p>
<p>But what is this church of Rome ? Does it mean the
</p>
<p>whole body of believers under the pope ? No, indeed ;
</p>
<p>we are not Congregationalists. It is not their duty to
</p>
<p>judge or teach ; but to hear their superiors, believe and
</p>
<p>obey. What, then, is the church ? If you would know
</p>
<p>definitely, then hear. It is the body of bishops in .union
</p>
<p>with the pope, their head ; and they are inspired, not as
</p>
<p>individuals, but in their corporate capacity. This is the
</p>
<p>church that we mean. It is the ecclesia docens the teach-
</p>
<p>ing church. It is an inspired, infallible, indefectible body
</p>
<p>of teachers. These, as a corporation, are, as it were, an
</p>
<p>incarnation of God the body of Christ. Through them
</p>
<p>God speaks and acts. Through them he interprets the

</p>
<p>men does he so act or speak. If you hear them, you hear
</p>
<p>him ; if you reject them, you reject him. They occupy
</p>
<p>precisely the same place relatively to the world that the
</p>
<p>apostles did of old. Indeed, they are the successors of
</p>
<p>the apostles, and inherit all their prerogatives and powers ;
</p>
<p>and as a rejection of the apostles would have been fatal
</p>
<p>then, so is a rejection of this inspired and infallible body
</p>
<p>of their successors now. Therefore, if you do not believe
</p>
<p>in the church of Rome, you cannot believe in Christ or be
</p>
<p>saved. Believe, therefore, in the church of Rome, and
</p>
<p>through her in Christ, and thou shalt be saved, is still the
</p>
<p>reply.
</p>
<p>We have thus arrived at what is, beyond all doubt, the
</p>
<p>central power of the Romish system. This is the great
</p>
<p>citadel of spiritual Babylon. On this point comes up the
</p>
<p>main, the dividing, issue between Romanists and Prot-
</p>
<p>estants. The demand of faith in the Romish corporation
</p>
<p>as an infallible church, as essential to salvation, is the
</p>
<p>vital power of the greai Romish apostasy ; its denial is the

<p>fundamental position of Protestantism.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER IY.
</p>
<p>THE PRECEDING STATEMENTS CONFIRMED.
</p>
<p>THAT the rejection of the pope and the corporation of
</p>
<p>bishops is the essence of Protestantism is exceedingly
</p>
<p>manifest, as will appear from the following among other
</p>
<p>reasons :
</p>
<p>1. Though there are numerous other errors in the
</p>
<p>system, as image worship, transubstantiation, the mass,
</p>
<p>purgatory, &c., yet any one of them can be removed, yea,
</p>
<p>many of them, and yet leave the mainspring of the system
</p>
<p>in powerful operation ; but take this corporation away, and
</p>
<p>the system dies. As an ox smitten on the side does not
</p>
<p>die, nor if you cut off a leg or a horn does he die, but if
</p>
<p>you smite him on his forehead, on his brain, his whole system
</p>
<p>is dissolved, and he dies, so is it here. This is the forehead
</p>
<p>beneath which lies the brain of the system ; smite it, and
</p>
<p>it dies. God has seven hammers, any one of which can
</p>
<p>smite it with omnipotent power ; how much more all ! In
</p>
<p>the proper place I shall produce them. My object now is
</p>
<p>simply to bring forward the system and show where to smite.
</p>
<p>2. Till this is smitten down, it is a wall of defence
</p>
<p>around all the interior absurdities of the system. In vain
</p>
<p>do you object against them ; it is all set aside as mere pri-
</p>
<p>vate judgment. You deem them false, say they ; but what
</p>
<p>is the worth of your individual opinion? The church
</p>
<p>deems them true ; and who is most likely to be right ?

</p>
<p>Has she not God's promise "to be with her always and to
</p>
<p>guide her into all truth ?
</p>
<p>3. It effects a ruinous perversion of the principle of
</p>
<p>faith one of the most important and powerful of the soul,
</p>
<p>and the most injurious in its perversion. Any absurdity
</p>
<p>however great, once taken into this enclosure, is exempted
</p>
<p>from the scrutiny of reason, and belief is debased to re-
</p>
<p>ceive it.
</p>
<p>4. It makes the system essentially, logically, and of
</p>
<p>necessity, intolerant and exterminating, regarding all
</p>
<p>other systems as the gospel does idolatry i. e., as rebel-
</p>
<p>lion against God. Many Protestants do not seem to be
</p>
<p>aware of this, and think that Protestants ought to regard
</p>
<p>Romanism as one of the many fraternal Christian sects.
</p>
<p>But they mistake its necessary logical relation to all other
</p>
<p>bodies. It does not acknowledge any of them as any part
</p>
<p>of the church of Christ, nor as Christians. It does not
</p>
<p>ask to be put on a level with them. It has no part or lot
</p>
<p>with them. They are sons of Belial, all of them
</p>
<p>enemies of God, children of perdition, on the road to hell ;
</p>
<p>and its only duty and avowed end is to convert or extermi-
</p>
<p>nate them.
</p>
<p>Indeed, it denounces them all as pagans. The cele-
</p>
<p>brated Brownson, speaking, as he declares, under the
</p>
<p>sanction of the American Papal bishops, says, (Quarterly
</p>
<p>Review, January, 1854, p. 96,) " Our American society is
</p>
<p>pagan, not Christian." Hence he affirms that the Papists
</p>
<p>are situated as were the first Christians under pagan Rome,
</p>
<p>and that they are an insulated system in which are all the
</p>
<p>hopes of society.
</p>
<p>"Almost every where the faithful, as under the pagan
</p>
<p>emperors of Rome, must constitute a society of their own,
</p>
<p>independent of the pagan society in the midst of which

<p>wants and necessities. This Catholic society is in the old
</p>
<p>world the remains of a once general Catholic society ; in
</p>
<p>our country it is, as under the pagan Caesars, the germ or
</p>
<p>nucleus of a new Catholic state. All the hopes of the old
</p>
<p>world centre in these Catholic remnants ; all the hopes of
</p>
<p>the new in this Catholic germ. It is this Catholic society,
</p>
<p>sustaining itself or forming itself under overshadowing
</p>
<p>heathenism, that we must consult in our addresses and dis-
</p>
<p>cussions. To save the non-Catholic society from continued
</p>
<p>decline and corruption is as hopeless as it was to save the
</p>
<p>Jewish state under the Roman governors, or pagan society
</p>
<p>under Nero or Diocletian. The thing is out of the ques-
</p>
<p>tion ; because modern society, as distinguished from the
</p>
<p>Catholic, has in itself no recuperative energy, no germ of
</p>
<p>life. All society must conform to the principles of our holy
</p>
<p>religion, and spring from Catholicity as its root, or sooner
</p>
<p>or later lapse into barbarism. The living germ in all
</p>
<p>modern nations, the nucleus of all future living society,
</p>
<p>is in the Catholic portion of the population. They are the
</p>
<p>salt of the earth ; they are the leaven that is to leaven
</p>
<p>the whole lump." Quarterly Review, pp. 97, 98.
</p>
<p>The feelings of some Romanists, and even their com-
</p>
<p>mon sense, may revolt from this ; nay, in view of the
</p>
<p>debased Romanist masses among us, it is both impudent
</p>
<p>and ludicrous ; but it is the stern, inevitable, logical

<p>result of the system, avowed in public formulas, fully

</p>
<p>He at this time deems it politic to disclaim in behalf
</p>
<p>of the church all force but moral, and says that is enough,
</p>
<p>and also concedes equal civil rights. His subsequent
</p>
<p>doctrine as to extermination will depend upon the power
</p>
<p>of the church. He then proceeds :
</p>
<p>" Save, then, in the discharge of our civil duties and in
</p>
<p>the ordinary business of life, there is and can be no har-
</p>
<p>mony between Catholics and Protestants. The two par-
</p>
<p>ties stand opposed ; separated, not by a mere paper wall,
</p>
<p>as some of the sects are, but by a great gulf. The peo-
</p>
<p>ple of Christ (i. e., the Romanists) are a peculiar people ;
</p>
<p>they stand out from the world, distinct, separate ; and
</p>
<p>must, if they will be the people of Christ. They can
</p>
<p>have no fellowship with Belial, nor live in peace and har-
</p>
<p>mony with his children, (i. e., the Protestants.")
</p>
<p>From such views he anticipates a Protestant reaction ;
</p>
<p>but he treats it with supreme contempt. He says,
</p>
<p>"The signs of the times seem to indicate that the sev-
</p>
<p>eral tribes of Goths, Vandals, Huns, and other barbarians
</p>
<p>are forming a league for a new invasion of Rome. "Well,
</p>
<p>be it so. He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh at
</p>
<p>them, and the Lord shall deride them. The Episcopalians
</p>
<p>may read their destiny in that of the old Donatists, whom
</p>
<p>in many respects they resemble ; and all the Protestant
</p>
<p>sects combined are not so formidable to the church as were
</p>
<p>at one period the old Arians. The church triumphed over
</p>
<p>the Arians ; she will triumph over the Protestants. A
</p>
<p>union whose principle is hatred will not long subsist, but
</p>
<p>will soon break asunder. Protestantism is doomed. The
</p>
<p>devil may be very active and full of wrath and utter
</p>
<p>great swelling words for a season, because he knows
</p>
<p>that his time is short ; but Protestantism must go the way
</p>
<p>of all the earth."

<p>This seems to be sufficiently explicit. Yet doubtless

<p>28 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>there will be still some charitable souls who will think
</p>
<p>it illiberal to suspect the Romanists of ulterior evil
</p>
<p>designs, and call even argument in self-defence persecu-
</p>
<p>tion, and wonder why we will persecute a sect of Chris-
</p>

</p>
<p>as to outgrow their ancient bigotry and exclusiveness.

<p>5. So far as it is believed, it becomes a corporation in-
</p>
<p>vested with the highest powers of despotism that the mind
</p>
<p>of man can conceive. It has the monopoly, not of bank-
</p>
<p>ing, or corn, or wheat, but of the grace of God, of heaven
</p>
<p>and hell ; and such a body will bind men to their sway
</p>
<p>by the whole weight of eternal joys and eternal woes.
</p>
<p>It has logically carried out its views ; and kings and na-
</p>
<p>tions have quailed before its terrors. Its logical tenden-
</p>
<p>cies are still the same. Nothing but the counterpoise of
</p>
<p>Protestantism prevents it. On this it gnashes its teeth,
</p>
<p>and longs to exterminate it. To be sure, they tell us that
</p>
<p>it will be safe to put such power into the hands of such a
</p>
<p>corporation ; for God will not let his bride, his wife,
</p>
<p>abuse it. Gentle souls! As if the experience of more
</p>
<p>than a thousand years had thrown no light on that point !
</p>
<p>6. It urges, in the nature of the case, the most important
</p>
<p>and momentous claim that a body of men can make. It
</p>
<p>involves not merely a question of truth or falsehood, as in
</p>
<p>the case of common historical facts. It admits of no mid-
</p>
<p>dle ground between the highest and most momentous truth
</p>
<p>and a falsehood of the deepest and most damning guilt.
</p>
<p>God either sanctions the claim with his whole soul, or
</p>
<p>with his whole soul he abhors it.
</p>
<p>7. If such a question is involved, it can be settled.
</p>
<p>There must be truth on such a point. Interest and
</p>
<p>organic power may resist ; but God is almighty ; and
</p>
<p>he can so wield truth that they will give way.

<p>8. It is the great question of the age. For three hundred
</p>
<p>THE PRECEDING STATEMENTS CONFIRMED. 29
</p>
<p>years Christendom has been divided into two contending
</p>
<p>camps. Things cannot remain so : there must be a de-
</p>
<p>cision ; there will be. The systems are diametrically op-
</p>
<p>posed : one must and will exterminate the other. But it
</p>
<p>will not be without a moral conflict unknown before
</p>
<p>the battle of the great day of God Almighty.
</p>
<p>From this brief view of the state of the case one thinp-
</p>
<p>is clear that it is a system that ought, especially at this
</p>
<p>time, to be thoroughly understood ; not misrepresented,
</p>
<p>not dealt with on grounds of prejudice, but studied,
</p>
<p>analyzed, understood in the light of history, philosophy,
</p>
<p>and Scripture.
</p>
<p>We ought not to be simple, credulous, and the dupes of
</p>
<p>craft and delusion. The main stress of the conflict will
</p>
<p>be upon such points as these : Is there evidence in the
</p>
<p>nature of things, or in the word or in the providence of
</p>
<p>God, as developed in history, that the claims of this cor-
</p>
<p>poration are well founded ? Or do they prove them to be
</p>
<p>false, impious, and destructive ?
</p>
<p>In reply to these inquiries, I shall undertake to show
</p>
<p>that, so far is the Romish corporation from being an
</p>
<p>ordinance of God, it is rather a fraudulent conspiracy
</p>
<p>against the interests of God and humanity ; that it is so
</p>
<p>far from having its basis in Scripture and reason that it
</p>
<p>is rather an imposture and a forgery ; that it is so far
</p>
<p>from being God's messenger of blessings to men that it
</p>
<p>is rather the enemy of mankind and hostile to the best
</p>
<p>interests of society ; and that Protestantism, so far from
</p>
<p>deserving the anathemas and curses heaped upon it by
</p>
<p>that proud and aspiring corporation, is founded in truth,
</p>
<p>is honorable to God, and is the only sure defence of our
</p>
<p>country and of mankind.

</p>
<p>THE BIGHTS OF HEX AS TO TRUTH AND FIDELITY
</p>
<p>INVADED BY ROMANISM.
</p>
<p>THE nature of man as a social being is such that his
</p>
<p>fundamental necessity is a knowledge of the truth. He is
</p>
<p>called on to act in a great system with man and with
</p>
<p>God. How, then, can he act aright unless he knows what
</p>
<p>that system is and what are his relations to it? How can
</p>
<p>man act safely and confidently in his intercourse with man
</p>
<p>unless he knows the real state and relations of the things
</p>
<p>and events around him? Every man, therefore, has an
</p>
<p>indefeasible claim on his fellow-man to know from him
</p>
<p>the truth. To establish and justify the utterance of false-
</p>
<p>hood, is to strike a blow at the very basis of the social
</p>
<p>system.
</p>

</p>
<p>delude them, even under the pretence of promoting their
</p>
<p>good, or for the sake of any alleged general interest.
</p>
<p>All men have a right also to truth and fidelity as to
</p>
<p>promises and contracts.
</p>
<p>They have no less a right to defence in a free use of
</p>
<p>their powers in the study of God and his laws and works
</p>
<p>and truth in general.
</p>
<p>All these rights the Romish corporation invades. In
</p>
<p>fact, it is a conspiracy to defraud men of all their rights,
</p>
<p>and to disfranchise and extirpate all who refuse to submit
</p>
<p>to its claims.
</p>
<p>They take the ground that no man has a right to know
</p>
<p>the truth from them in any case where they regard it as
</p>
<p>inconsistent with their own interests.
</p>
<p>That no promises or oaths are binding- to those who
</p>
<p>oppose their interests and renounce their authority ; and
</p>
<p>that all the civil and political rights of those who thus
</p>
<p>oppose their interests are forfeited, as well as their prop-
</p>
<p>erty and lives.
</p>
<p>A corporation which takes this ground is, in the strictest
</p>
<p>and most absolute sense, a fraudulent conspiracy against
</p>
<p>the interests and the rights of mankind.
</p>
<p>In discussing these allegations, we should not deem it
</p>
<p>sufficient to look at the professions made by the advocates
</p>
<p>of the corporation when weak and in the minority, but
</p>
<p>should ask, What are the principles of the corporation
</p>
<p>itself? What has it always avowed and done whenever
</p>
<p>no external power has prevented its full development?
</p>
<p>These inquiries shall be answered by an appeal to history.
</p>
<p>Xo system has a history more full and definite. The
</p>
<p>tendencies which we shall allege have imbodied them-
</p>
<p>selves in facts ; indeed, its history is one great tragedy.

</p>
<p>CHAPTER- II.
</p>
<p>POPISH PRINCIPLES OF VERACITY AND FIDELITY
</p>
<p>No man can understand the Papal church until he has
</p>
<p>thoroughly learned that it is a corporation which, on fixed
</p>
<p>principle, authorizes the practice of perfidy in its own de-
</p>
<p>fence. It is no less certain that no man is qualified to
</p>
<p>deal with the system and its defenders until their use of
</p>
<p>falsehood is perfectly understood.
</p>
<p>There is among Protestants a tacit understanding that
</p>
<p>a solemn assertion of falsehood before God is wrong ;
</p>
<p>and when ministers, bishops, and universities swear to the
</p>
<p>truth of certain assertions, it seems dishonorable not to
</p>
<p>believe them.
</p>
<p>But he who does believe them in any case affecting the
</p>
<p>interests of their religion is simple. In precisely such
</p>
<p>circumstances, their most eminent popes and prelates have
</p>
<p>not hesitated to equivocate, deceive, and even directly and
</p>
<p>unequivocally to lie. Yea, their principles offer rewards
</p>
<p>to such lying, as eminently meritorious in the sight of God.
</p>
<p>It is, therefore, no want of charity, it is no want of
</p>
<p>magnanimity, to deny any credence to any of the advocates
</p>
<p>of this system on their mere word and in cases affecting
</p>
<p>its interests. It would be, on the other hand, inexcusable
</p>
<p>weakness and simplicity to believe them. In addition to
</p>
<p>the effects of the perverted teaching of this corporation,
</p>
<p>there is also the influence of the fact, which I shall soon

<p>develop, that it is so founded on fraud and forgeries that
</p>
<p>it cannot bear the scrutiny of an impartial historian.
</p>
<p>But it is obvious, that if a true view of history is ruinous
</p>
<p>to powerful existing organizations, even if they were not
</p>
<p>educated to lie, great would be the temptation to color,
</p>
<p>distort, or deny the real facts of history. But if any cor-
</p>
<p>poration is from education prone to falsify history, and is
</p>
<p>under the influence of base examples and principles, how
</p>
<p>much more sure the results ! If, therefore, of the Romish
</p>
<p>corporation all these things are true ; if a true view of
</p>
<p>history will destroy them ; if they are trained to the use of
</p>
<p>forgery and fraud, and are under the influence of base
</p>
<p>principles and precedents, we need to be fully aware of
</p>
<p>these facts. For this purpose I propose to state at some
</p>
<p>length what are the genuine principles and what has-been
</p>
<p>the practice of the Romish corporation as it regards lying
</p>
<p>and perjury for the good of the church.
</p>
<p>I have no intention, in this inquiry, to bring any sweep-
</p>
<p>ing charges against every individual who is found in the
</p>
<p>Catholic laity. I do not confound them with the corpora-
</p>
<p>tion by which they are ruled, and of which few of them
</p>
<p>study or understand the real principles. To a great ex-
</p>
<p>tent, they are more deceived than deceiving. Nor do I
</p>
<p>intend to overlook the fact that there are, in the great
</p>
<p>body of Romish ecclesiastics and historians, a few writers
</p>
<p>of very honorable principles and practice. Thus I do not
</p>
<p>intend to include in any one general statement persons
</p>
<p>whose principles and practice are so unlike as those of
</p>
<p>Pascal, Fenelon, Dupin, Sarpi, De Thou, Daunou, on the
</p>
<p>one hand, and Escobar, Molina, Baronius, Bellarmine, De
</p>
<p>Maistre, &c., on the other. In a body so divided into
</p>
<p>parties and factions as the church of Rome has always
</p>
<p>been, and in which characters and principles are so various,

<p>reprobated. Nor do I intend to hurt the feelings of any
</p>
<p>by charging on them the belief of principles which they
</p>
<p>disavow in theory and repudiate in practice.
</p>
<p>But, as a great conflict is before us, I do propose to in-
</p>
<p>quire, What ought a wise, honorable, just, and benevolent
</p>
<p>Protestant to think of the principles and influence of the
</p>
<p>great Romish system that opposes him, as it regards speak-
</p>
<p>ing the truth, and also as to the observance of truth,
</p>
<p>as it regards history, reputation, contracts, covenants, and
</p>
<p>oaths ? This is essential,
</p>
<p>1. As a safeguard against the abuse of that benevolent
</p>
<p>and honorable simplicity of unsuspecting minds on which
</p>
<p>unprincipled deceivers are ready at all times to practice.
</p>
<p>If we are to deal with a society who have reduced the art
</p>
<p>of lying or equivocation to system, we ought to know
</p>
<p>them, and not be overreached by them.
</p>
<p>2. As essential in order to aid in forming a judgment as
</p>
<p>to the real facts of history. If a whole body is tempted,
</p>
<p>by fear of ruin, to misrepresent facts, we ought ever to
</p>
<p>bear it in mind.
</p>
<p>3. As having a direct bearing on the logic of the main
</p>
<p>question the existence of an infallible corporation ; for,
</p>
<p>if in the middle ages the Romish corporation decreed what
</p>
<p>all concede to be false and immoral, their claims are
</p>
<p>destroyed.
</p>
<p>I come, therefore, directly to the question, How shall
</p>
<p>these principles be ascertained ? What is the highest and
</p>
<p>most decisive evidence ? And I reply, Not the testimony of
</p>
<p>British laymen or ecclesiastics in the Papal church, who
</p>
<p>had in this age of light a high interest to deny certain
</p>
<p>allegations as to the doctrines of that church, in order to
</p>
<p>gain political privileges, whilst still they had no power to
</p>
<p>settle points of faith ; nor the testimony of foreign uni-

</p>
<p>PAPAL PROFESSIONS IN GREAT BRITAIN AND AMERICA.
</p>
<p>DURING the long controversy on Catholic emancipation,
</p>
<p>incessant efforts were made by Charles Butler, a learned
</p>
<p>Popish lawyer, and by others, to convince the British public
</p>
<p>that it was safe to restore to British Romanists full politi-
</p>
<p>cal powers and privileges, on the ground that the Romish
</p>
<p>system did not justify a violation of faith or of good
</p>
<p>morals. To obtain satisfaction for the British government,
</p>
<p>appeal was made to individual divines and to certain foreign
</p>
<p>universities to ascertain whether the real principles of the
</p>
<p>Papacy justified the pope in deposing heretical monarchs
</p>
<p>and absolving their subjects from the oath of allegiance,
</p>
<p>and, in general, the violation of faith with heretics.
</p>
<p>The universities addressed were those of Louvain,
</p>
<p>Douay, and Paris, in France, and Alcala, Valladolid,
</p>
<p>and Salamanca, in "Spain. The faculties of all these uni-
</p>
<p>versities unanimously declared that the principles of the
</p>
<p>Romish system did not justify any of these things. They
</p>
<p>were even, in the words of the University of Louvain,
</p>
<p>" struck with astonishment that such questions should, at
</p>
<p>the end of this eighteenth century, be proposed to any
</p>
<p>learned body by inhabitants of a kingdom that glories in the
</p>
<p>talent and discernment of its natives." The University
</p>
<p>of Alcala does not hesitate to say that those who imputed
</p>
<p>to the Romish church such doctrines were instigated by

<p>the devil, even as of old the Jews were instigated by him
</p>
<p>to slander Christ.
</p>
<p>The reply of the University of Douay, as the shortest^
</p>
<p>we will quote from Butler's Historical Memoirs, vol. i.,
</p>
<p>pp. 445-448.
</p>
<p>Extracted from the Register of the Sacred Faculty of Divinity
</p>
<p>of the University of Douay.
</p>
<p>January 5, 1789.
</p>
<p>At a meeting of the faculty of divinity of the Univer-
</p>
<p>sity of Douay, the dean informed them that the Catholics
</p>
<p>of England were desirous of the opinion of the faculty
</p>
<p>upon three questions, the tenor of which was as follows :
</p>
<p>1. Has the pope, by virtue of any authority, power, or
</p>
<p>jurisdiction derived to him from God, or have the cardi-
</p>
<p>nals, or even the church itself, any civil authority, civil
</p>
<p>power, or civil jurisdiction whatsoever in the kingdom
</p>
<p>of England ?
</p>
<p>2. Can the pope, the cardinals, or the church herself
</p>
<p>absolve or free the subjects of the King of England from
</p>
<p>their oath of allegiance ?
</p>
<p>3. Is there any principle of the Catholic faith by which
</p>
<p>Catholics are justified in not keeping faith with heretics
</p>
<p>or other persons who differ from them in religious opinions ?
</p>
<p>These questions first having been privately considered
</p>
<p>by each professor of divinity, and afterwards having been
</p>
<p>attentively discussed by the public meeting,
</p>
<p>To the first and second of them the sacred faculty
</p>
<p>answers, That no power whatsoever, in civil or temporal
</p>
<p>concerns, was given by the Almighty, either to the pope,
</p>
<p>the cardinals, or the church herself ; and consequently
</p>
<p>that kings and sovereigns are not, in temporal concerns,
</p>
<p>subject by the ordination of God to any ecclesiastical
</p>
<p>power whatsoever; neither can their subjects, by any

</p>
<p>authority granted to the pope or the church from above,
</p>
<p>be freed from their obedience or absolved from their oath
</p>
<p>of allegiance.
</p>
<p>This is the doctrine which the doctors and professors of
</p>
<p>4
</p>
<p>38 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>divinity hold and teach in our schools; and this all the
</p>
<p>candidates for degrees in divinity maintain in their public
</p>
<p>theses.
</p>
<p>To the third question the sacred faculty answers, That
</p>
<p>there is no principle of the Catholic faith by which Catho-
</p>
<p>lics are justified in not keeping faith with heretics who
</p>
<p>differ from them in religious opinions. On the contrary,
</p>
<p>it is the unanimous doctrine of Catholics, that the respect
</p>
<p>due to the name of God, so called to witness, requires
</p>
<p>that the oath be inviolably kept to -whomsoever it is
</p>
<p>pledged, whether Catholic, heretic, or infidel.
</p>
<p>Done on the day and in the year above stated, by order
</p>
<p>of the illustrious lords of the holy faculty.

<p>uniformly taught that neither the cardinals, nor the pope,
</p>
<p>nor even the church herself have any jurisdiction or
</p>
<p>power, by divine right, over the temporals of kings,
</p>
<p>sovereigns, or their subjects ; and consequently that kings
</p>
<p>and sovereigns are not, in temporal concerns, subject by
</p>
<p>the ordination of God to any ecclesiastical power whatso-
</p>
<p>ever ; nor can their subjects, by any authority granted to
</p>
<p>the pope or the church from above, be freed from their
</p>
<p>obedience or absolved from their oaths of allegiance.
</p>
<p>Further : the doctors of these faculties declare, That an
</p>
<p>oath implies an obligation of natural and divine right, by
</p>
<p>which the party is bound to perform the promise contained
</p>
<p>in his oath to whomsoever that promise be made, whether
</p>
<p>he be a Catholic, a heretic, or an infidel ; and that no
</p>
<p>person, through pretext of heresy or infidelity in the party
</p>
<p>to whom the promise is given, can be released from his
</p>
<p>obligation. The Catholic religion, far from admitting any
</p>
<p>principle by which oaths can be dispensed with, holds such
</p>
<p>peijuries in abhorrence.

<p>The effect of such assertions on Protestants, ignorant
</p>
<p>of the mazes of Romanism, would of necessity be great.
</p>
<p>Nor do we wonder at it. Men of such eminence and

<p>the British Commons in 1826, made similar protestations
</p>
<p>against the doctrines charged.
</p>
<p>The past history of Great Britain ought to have taught
</p>
<p>them caution ; but they believed, and, to a certain extent,
</p>
<p>have acted accordingly.

<p>Even in Boston, at a time when the public mind began
</p>
<p>to be aroused in view of the dangers impending from th
</p>
<p>developments of the Papal conspiracy against these United
</p>
<p>States, these same responses of foreign universities were
</p>
<p>referred to as evincing that there was no ground for dis
</p>
<p>trust and alarm by those who, for various reasons, were
</p>
<p>disposed to look on the best side of Romanism. The
</p>
<p>reply of the University of Douay, which is before them,
</p>
<p>will enable iny readers to judge of the tenor of all the
</p>
<p>others ; and certainly its denial of the doctrines imputed
</p>
<p>is sufficiently explicit. If it were safe to regard such
</p>
<p>statements at all as having authority, it would probably
</p>
<p>increase the force of this particular document that we
</p>
<p>have in it the statement of the faculty of the canon and
</p>
<p>civil law, which was not the case in the other univer-
</p>
<p>sities.

<p>nounce in no measured terms all who, with Professor Park,
</p>
<p>PAPAL PROFESSIONS IN GEEAT BRITAIN AND AMERICA. 41
</p>
<p>have dared to impute to her the maxim that no faith is to
</p>
<p>be kept with heretics. Hear his indignant disclaimer :
</p>
<p>" ' No faith to be kept with heretics.' Where did the
</p>
<p>professor learn that this is a maxim of Catholicity ? It
</p>
<p>is false. Catholicity knows no such maxim ; and Catholic
</p>
<p>history authorizes no inference that she practically adopts
</p>
<p>or in the least conceivable manner countenances it. In-
</p>
<p>dividuals of bad faith may be found, no doubt, even among
</p>
<p>Catholics ; but that Catholicity or Catholic doctors any
</p>
<p>where countenance any thing of the sort, is a malignant
</p>
<p>falsehood. We are taught and required to keep our faith
</p>
<p>with all men ; and faith plighted to a heretic can no more
</p>
<p>be broken without sin than faith plighted to a true be-
</p>
<p>liever. We would that Protestants would observe a tithe
</p>
<p>of the good faith towards Catholics that Catholics do to-
</p>
<p>wards Protestants ; and, when they shall do so, we give
</p>
<p>them leave to abuse our morals to their full satisfaction."
</p>
<p>Bishop Kenrick, of Philadelphia, has also given assur-
</p>
<p>ances of a similar import. He was induced to do it in
</p>
<p>order to produce the belief that no danger is to be appre-
</p>
<p>hended to the political institutions of this country from
</p>
<p>the extensive spread of the Romish system. Romanists,
</p>
<p>he assures us, whether ecclesiastics or laymen, are as good
</p>
<p>citizens as any Protestants whatever, and do not hold the
</p>
<p>odious dogmas as to the violation of faith to heretics that
</p>
<p>are imputed to them. See his treatise on the Primacy,
</p>
<p>pp. 469-471.

<p>WHAT OUGHT WE TO BELIEVE?
</p>
<p>WHY ought we not to believe such statements ? Can
</p>
<p>we suppose that such men are mistaken, or that they will
</p>
<p>wilfully falsify ?
</p>
<p>Without answering the question as to wilful falsification,
</p>
<p>I reply, all such statements are of no force, because they
</p>
<p>produce no evidence from those whose prerogative it is to
</p>
<p>decide what is, and what is not, a part of the Romish faith.
</p>
<p>That there is such a body, they know as well as we. Why,
</p>
<p>then, instead of giving us their own assertions, do they
</p>
<p>not give us the words of that supreme authority ?
</p>
<p>They know, as well as we, that no bishop, and no fac-
</p>
<p>ulty of any university, can settle a principle of the Romish
</p>
<p>faith. The fundamental principles of the system forbid
</p>
<p>it. They know, too, that all such statements are worth no
</p>
<p>more than so much waste paper.
</p>
<p>These universities, as well as Charles Butler, the histo-
</p>
<p>rian and leader of the Romish party in England, and the
</p>
<p>Romish laity, followed the principles of the Gallican or
</p>
<p>cisalpine divines, at the head of whom was Bossuet, who
</p>
<p>wrote under the influence of the great monarch of France.
</p>
<p>But neither the Pope of Rome nor a general council ever
</p>
<p>sanctioned the views of these divines. Of what use, then,
</p>
<p>is it, in such a case, to appeal to the opinions of such au-
</p>
<p>thorities ?

</p>
<p>Nor is any more weight due to the American protesta-
</p>
<p>tions, especially to the statements of Mr. Brownson. "We
</p>
<p>may well ask what is his authority, that he should under-
</p>
<p>take to settle a question like this? He is not even an
</p>
<p>ecclesiastic ; he is a mere layman ; and he knows, as well as
</p>
<p>any one else, that on a point like this his assertions have no
</p>
<p>more weight than the light dust of the balance.
</p>
<p>WHAT IS THE SUPREME TRIBUNAL?
</p>
<p>What, then, is binding on all Romanists as an article of
</p>
<p>faith? "What is the highest authority in such a case?
</p>
<p>Whose decision is final and supreme? I answer, that
</p>
<p>which is binding according to the views of all ; that which
</p>
<p>is the highest evidence is the decision of a general coun-
</p>
<p>cil, sanctioned by the pope, or a decision of the pope,
</p>
<p>ex cathedra, acquiesced in by the bishops.
</p>
<p>That this is the true view of the case, Mr. Brownson
</p>
<p>will not pretend to deny. He has distinctly affirmed it.
</p>
<p>The statement of Peter. Dens is perfectly coincident.
</p>
<p>"To whom does the authority of judgment in contro-
</p>
<p>versies respecting the faith belong?"
</p>
<p>" Ans. To the superiors of the church : namely, to the
</p>
<p>bishops, and above all to the supreme pontiff."
</p>
<p>" Does this judgment in matters of faith not appertain
</p>
<p>to theological doctors or other ecclesiastics ? "
</p>
<p>" Ans. No ; and hence, in general councils, they have
</p>
<p>not a decisive vote ; but they are admitted to them only
</p>
<p>for the examination of subjects and for consultation ;
</p>
<p>much less, therefore, are laymen judges in matters of
</p>
<p>faith."
</p>
<p>He also says of the bishops not assembled in council,
</p>
<p>that, if they coincide with a decision of a pope, it is of

</p>
<p>44 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>church dispersed is equally infallible as if assembled in
</p>

</p>
<p>Nor is it necessary that all the bishops should be unan-
</p>

<p>Roman corporation that they were compelled to renounce

<p>queries to the court of Rome, and request a bull, to be
</p>
<p>acquiesced in by all bishops, in which the pope should re-
</p>
<p>nounce all claims to civil authority out of his own terri-

<p>tories, and all power to depose monarchs and other rulers,
</p>
<p>and to release their subjects from their oath of allegiance,
</p>
<p>and in which especially he should condemn as heretical
</p>
<p>the maxim of so many of his predecessors, that no faith is
</p>
<p>to be kept with heretics ? Or why did he not request a
</p>
<p>general council, in which these things should be clearly
</p>
<p>defined and settled to the satisfaction of his Protestant
</p>
<p>majesty the King of Great Britain? Did he infer from
</p>
<p>the previous systematic opposition of the popes to sanc-
</p>
<p>tioning those disclaimers on these points, which had been
</p>
<p>inserted by the British kings in the oaths of allegiance

</p>
<p>even Charles Butler is obliged to condemn as wrong, that
</p>
<p>the pope was unwilling to commit himself on these points,
</p>
<p>lest he should renounce powers which it might be expe-
</p>
<p>dient still to retain for future use ?
</p>
<p>If so, was it not the extreme of simplicity in him to think
</p>
<p>that, by a mode so purely congregational, he could decide
</p>
<p>what are the doctrines of the Romish church? What
</p>
<p>right have laymen, and priests, and professors in univer-
</p>
<p>sities to decide what are the doctrines of the Romish
</p>
<p>church ? Who authorized them ? Who gave them their
</p>
<p>authority ? So, too, Mr. Brownson's indignant disclaimer
</p>
<p>of Professor Park's implication, that the Romish church
</p>
<p>have taught the maxim, no faith is to be kept with heretics,
</p>
<p>of what worth is it ? He is neither the pope nor a
</p>
<p>general council, and his opinion is worth no more than
</p>
<p>that of any Protestant, and far less than that of Professor
</p>
<p>Park, as we shall soon see. From all private opinions,
</p>
<p>then, I shall appeal to the decisions of popes, acquiesced
</p>
<p>in by the bishops of the Catholic world, and of general
</p>
<p>councils, for direct and decisive evidence on the point in
</p>
<p>question.
</p>
<p>There is also another kind of evidence to which I shall
</p>
<p>resort. It is the ARGUMENT CUMULATIVE FROM FACTS, on
</p>
<p>the obvious principle that though one case of forgery, ly-
</p>
<p>ing, or perjury does not prove that the system tends to
</p>
<p>such results, yet the repetition of such facts, in great num-
</p>
<p>bers and on the great scale, does implicate the radical
</p>
<p>character of the system. The coming up of one poison-
</p>
<p>ous weed does not prove that a given soil has in it the
</p>
<p>seed of such weeds ; but if, year after year, such weeds
</p>
<p>spring up in all directions and in spite of all kinds of
</p>
<p>culture, it is proof that the seed of such weeds is in the
</p>
<p>soil. So if, for centuries, when the system of Romanism

</p>
<p>CHAPTER Y.
</p>
<p>POSITIONS TO BE PROVED.
</p>
<p>- IN conducting the examination, I shall consider mainly
</p>
<p>that period in history when the system was left most to
</p>
<p>itself, when there were no Protestant nations to fear or
</p>
<p>to delude, and when it felt that the world was its own.
</p>
<p>Then, surely, would a divinely established and infallible
</p>
<p>corporation show its true character and develop its real
</p>
<p>principles.
</p>
<p>I refer to the period between the consummation of the
</p>
<p>Papal power by the forged decretals and the time of the
</p>
<p>council of Constance. During this time the following
</p>
<p>general councils were held : 1123, 1st Lateran ; 1139, 2d
</p>
<p>Lateran ; 1179,3d Lateran ; 1215, 4th Lateran ; 1245, 1st
</p>
<p>of Lyons ; 1274, 2d of Lyons ; 1311, council of Vienna ;
</p>
<p>1409, council of Pisa, which the Italian party consider as
</p>
<p>not established among the general councils ; 1414, the
</p>
<p>council of Constance.
</p>
<p>The decrees of these councils are now before me in the
</p>
<p>third volume of Binius, from which I shall make extracts.
</p>
<p>This is a part of the Roman Bible. It has, in fact, had far
</p>
<p>more authority in the Roman world than the word of God.
</p>
<p>As in the days of Christ, they have made void the law of
</p>
<p>God by their traditions. Referring to this and to other
</p>
<p>sources of evidence, then, I affirm the following things :
</p>
<p>1. That the Romish church has taught and sanctioned

</p>
<p>lying and perjury, by professing to dissolve political oaths
</p>
<p>and other obligations, and authorizing and commanding
</p>
<p>men to act as if they were dissolved. Thereby she has
</p>
<p>involved them in the guilt of lying and perjury before
</p>
<p>God and man, as all enlightened Christians at this time
</p>
<p>fully believe.
</p>
<p>2. The principle that no faith is to be kept with a her-
</p>
<p>etic was formally established by the church as an article
</p>
<p>of faith, and all were solemnly anathematized who should
</p>
<p>dare to call it in question.
</p>
<p>3. The real nature of the dispensing power exercised
</p>
<p>by the popes was in history illustrated in such a variety
</p>
<p>of cases that there can be no possibility of misunderstand-
</p>
<p>ing it. It has been used to dissolve, 1. A most solemn
</p>
<p>covenant sanctioned by oath between the pope and a Cath-
</p>
<p>olic sovereign. 2. To dissolve most solemn covenants on
</p>
<p>oath between themselves and the body of cardinals. 3. To
</p>
<p>dissolve solemn covenants on oath between two Catholic
</p>
<p>sovereigns. 4. To dissolve a most solemn covenant on
</p>
<p>oath between a Catholic and a Mahometan sovereign.
</p>
<p>5. To dissolve the oaths of subjects to rulers, both Cath-
</p>
<p>olic and heretical. 6. To dissolve all obligation of all
</p>
<p>kinds and of all men towards heretics.
</p>
<p>4. The effects on human society and on the feelings of
</p>
<p>men, as to the obligations of truth and the sacredness of
</p>
<p>an oath in the Romish world, have been such as would
</p>
<p>naturally be produced by such doctrines.
</p>
<p>5. Even since the reformation, a code of morals has
</p>
<p>been promulgated, especially on the subject of lying and
</p>
<p>perjury, which is adapted to sap the very foundations of
</p>
<p>civil society and reduce the world to a state of perfect
</p>
<p>moral degradation and anarchy. And, what is worthy of
</p>
<p>special notice, it was promulgated by the most prominent

<p>cerning whom we are now taught by Mr. Brownson that
</p>
<p>they have been hated in all ages for righteousness' sake.
</p>
<p>They were so holy, he would have us believe, that this
</p>
<p>wicked world could not endure them ; and their suppres-
</p>
<p>sion and restoration he compares to the crucifixion and
</p>
<p>resurrection of Christ.
</p>
<p>6. In connection with these facts, we are to consider the
</p>
<p>forgeries which have disgraced the Romish corporation in
</p>
<p>all ages, the notorious frauds as it regards relics and mir-
</p>
<p>acles, and the cases in which prominent ecclesiastics have
</p>
<p>been detected in notorious falsehoods as a means of pro-
</p>
<p>moting their system, and then ask, Is such a coincidence
</p>
<p>of so many different systems of lying and perjury in con-
</p>
<p>nection with the same body, followed up by correspondent
</p>
<p>practice, an accident ?
</p>
<p>Does it not rather look like the carrying out of certain
</p>
<p>great original and fundamental principles of the system ?
</p>
<p>If, then, we find these principles formally laid down by
</p>
<p>supreme authority, and in numerous and various modes
</p>
<p>reduced to practice, can any evidence be conceived of
</p>
<p>more decisive?
</p>
<p>7. In order to complete the statement of facts, we add,
</p>
<p>finally, that this system of perfidy and fraud has been
</p>
<p>linked in with, and ministered to, an extended and exe-
</p>
<p>crable system of persecution, with which the corporation
</p>
<p>of Rome has endeavored cruelly to exterminate all whom
</p>
<p>it has perfidiously disfranchised.

<p>CHAPTER VI.
</p>
<p>TESTIMONY ADDUCED.
</p>
<p>I HAVE now arraigned the Romish corporation before
</p>
<p>the bar of God and of the community on a charge of no
</p>
<p>light moment, either to them as a body, or to us as a na-
</p>
<p>tion, or to the human race. Let, then, every thinking mind
</p>
<p>closely scrutinize the sufficiency of my evidence.
</p>
<p>JOHN HUSS AND THE COUNCIL OF CONSTANCE.
</p>
<p>I shall begin with a clear development of the principles
</p>
<p>and practice of the Romish church, as defined by the coun-
</p>
<p>cil of Constance. This, as all know, was convened to ter-
</p>
<p>minate the great schism. Of it, Charles Butler, a distin-
</p>
<p>guished English Romanist, says, "It is eminent by the
</p>
<p>number and character of the persons present at its delib-
</p>
<p>erations, the regularity of its proceedings, and the wisdom
</p>
<p>and energy of its decrees. It was attended by thirty car-
</p>
<p>dinals, four patriarchs, twenty archbishops, three hundred
</p>
<p>bishops, and one thousand other ecclesiastics."
</p>
<p>Bonnechose says, " The composition of the council was
</p>
<p>worthy of the great interests that were to be discussed.
</p>
<p>There was not a kingdom, or state, or republic, or scarcely
</p>
<p>a city or community that was not represented at Con-
</p>
<p>stance. Two popes, John XXIII. and Martin V., acted

</p>
<p>as presidents, one at the beginning, the other at the end."
</p>
<p>John Huss was summoned to appear before the council and
</p>
<p>answer to charges against him for heresy. Before going,
</p>
<p>he applied to the Emperor Sigismund for a safe conduct.
</p>
<p>It was given. The terms were as follows :
</p>
<p>" We have received the honorable Mr. John Huss under
</p>
<p>our protection and defence." To all authorities he says,
</p>
<p>" Allow him without any impediment to go, to stop, to re-
</p>
<p>main, and TO RETURN freely ; and, whenever it shall be ne-
</p>
<p>cessary, let it be your pleasure, as it is your duty, to make
</p>
<p>provision for his secure and safe conduct, for the honor
</p>
<p>and reverence of our majesty."
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, the council, by a deputation to the
</p>
<p>emperor, distinctly urged it upon him that he was under
</p>
<p>no obligation to keep his promise to a heretic. Dachery,
</p>
<p>an eye witness, in his German history of the council, con-
</p>
<p>firms this fact : he says, " The deputation, in a long speech,
</p>
<p>persuaded the emperor that, by decretal authority, he should
</p>
<p>not keep faith with a man accused of heresy." And in the
</p>
<p>canon law, Decret. Greg., book v. tit. viii. cap. xvi., we
</p>
<p>find as follows :
</p>
<p>" Those who were bound by any obligations to heretics
</p>
<p>are freed from all obligation." "Let those who were
</p>
<p>bound to those who have manifestly fallen into heresy by
</p>
<p>any compact, NO MATTER WITH WHAT DEGREE OF STRENGTH IT
</p>
<p>MAY HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED, know that they are absolved
</p>
<p>from all obligations of FIDELITY, authority, and obedience
</p>
<p>of any kind."
</p>
<p>In the third Lateran 'council, twenty-seventh canon, a
</p>
<p>similar injunction exists as it regards those who coun-
</p>
<p>tenance certain heretics whom the council had excommu-
</p>
<p>nicated.
</p>
<p>" Let those who are bound to them by any compact or

<p>covenant know that they are released from all obligation
</p>
<p>of fidelity, homage, and every kind of obedience whilst
</p>
<p>they remain in so great iniquity."
</p>
<p>52 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>Tliis, it seems, they urged on the emperor, as applicable
</p>
<p>to him if he protected Huss. The council also threatened
</p>
<p>Sigismund, as he expressly affirms, that they would break
</p>
<p>up the sessions and disperse, and thus defeat his great end,
</p>
<p>that is, the healing the schism, if he persisted in his
</p>
<p>purpose to defend Huss according to his safe conduct. In
</p>
<p>these and other ways they prevailed. Sigismund was
</p>
<p>taught by them that no faith was to be kept with a heretic,
</p>
<p>and urged against his better feelings, till he consented to
</p>
<p>do the will of the council. Huss refused to" perjure him-
</p>
<p>self by abjuring errors which he did not hold ; nor would
</p>
<p>he renounce what the council called errors till convinced
</p>
<p>by them from the Bible that they were so. Hence they
</p>
<p>condemned him to the stake ; degraded him to the con-
</p>
<p>dition of a layman ; delivered him to the emperor; he deliv-
</p>
<p>ered him to the chief magistrate of Constance, and he to
</p>
<p>the executioners.
</p>
<p>Let us survey the closing scene. I give it in the words
</p>
<p>of Emile de Bonnechose, in his Reformers before the Ref-
</p>
<p>ormation, pp. 103, 104, New York edition :
</p>
<p>" They placed on his head a sort of crown, or pyramidal
</p>
<p>mitre, on which were painted frightful figures of demons,
</p>
<p>with this inscription : ' THE ARCH-HERETIC ; ' and, when he
</p>
<p>was thus arrayed, the prelates devoted his soul to the
</p>
<p>devils. John Huss, however, recommended his spirit to
</p>
<p>God, and said aloud, ' I wear with joy this crown of op-
</p>
<p>probrium, for the love of Him who bore a crown of
</p>
<p>thorns.'
</p>
<p>" The church then gave up all claim to him ; declared
</p>
<p>him a layman ; and, as such, delivered him over to the
</p>
<p>secular power, to conduct him to the place of punishment.
</p>
<p>John Huss, by the order of Sigismund, was given up by the
</p>
<p>Elector Palatine, vicar of tJie empire, to the chief magistrate

<p>of Constance, who, in his turn, abandoned him to the officers
</p>
<p>of justice. He walked between four town Serjeants to the
</p>
<p>place of execution. The princes followed, with an escort
</p>
<p>TESTIMONY ADDUCED. 53
</p>
<p>of eight hundred men, strongly armed ; and the concourse
</p>
<p>of the people was so prodigious that a bridge was very
</p>
<p>near breaking down under the multitude. ' In passing by
</p>
<p>the episcopal palace, Huss beheld a great fire consuming
</p>
<p>his books ; and he smiled at the sight.
</p>
<p>" The place of punishment was a meadow adjoining the
</p>
<p>gardens of the city, outside the gate of Gotleben. On ar-
</p>
<p>riving there, Huss kneeled down and recited some of the
</p>
<p>Penitential Psalms. Several of the people, hearing him
</p>
<p>pray with fervor, said aloud, '"We are ignorant of this
</p>
<p>man's crime ; but he offers up to God most excellent
</p>
<p>prayers.'
</p>
<p>'' When he was in front of the pile of wood which was
</p>
<p>to consume his body he was recommended to confess his
</p>
<p>sins. Huss consented, and a priest was brought to him, a
</p>
<p>man of great learning and high reputation. The priest
</p>
<p>refused to hear him unless he avowed his errors and re-
</p>
<p>tracted. 'A heretic,' he observed, 'can neither give nor
</p>
<p>receive the sacraments.' Huss replied, ' I do not feel my-
</p>
<p>self to be guilty of any mortal sin ; and, now that I am on
</p>
<p>the point of appearing before God, I will not purchase
</p>
<p>absolution by a perjury.'
</p>
<p>" When he wished to address the crowd in German, the
</p>
<p>Elector Palatine opposed it, and ordered him to be forth-
</p>
<p>with burned. 'Lord Jesus,' cried John Huss, 'I shall
</p>
<p>endeavor to endure with humility this frightful death,
</p>
<p>which I am awarded for thy holy gospel. Pardon all my
</p>
<p>enemies.' Whilst he was praying thus, with his eyes raised
</p>
<p>up to heaven, the paper crown fell off : he smiled ; but the
</p>
<p>soldiers replaced it on his head, in order, as they declared,
</p>
<p>that he might be burned with the devils whom he had
</p>
<p>obeyed.
</p>
<p>"Having obtained permission to speak to his keepers,

<p>he thanked them for the good treatment he had received
</p>
<p>at their hands. 'My brethren,' said he, 'learn that I firm-
</p>
<p>ly believe in my Savior : it is in his name that I suffer ; and
</p>
<p>this very day shall I go and reign with him.'
</p>
<p>" His body was then bound with thongs, with which he
</p>
<p>was firmly tied to a stake driven deep into the ground.
</p>
<p>"When he was so affixed some persons objected to his
</p>
<p>face being turned to the east, saying that this ought not to

</p>
<p>be, since he was a heretic. He was then untied and bound
</p>
<p>again to the stake with his face to the west. His head
</p>
<p>was held close to the wood by a chain smeared with soot,
</p>
<p>and the view of which inspired him with pious reflections
</p>
<p>on the ignominy of our Savior's sufferings.
</p>
<p>" Fagots were then arranged about and Under his feet,
</p>
<p>and around him was piled up a quantity of wood and straw.
</p>
<p>When all these preparations were completed, the Elector
</p>
<p>Palatine, accompanied by Count d'Oppenheim, marshal of
</p>
<p>the empire, came up to him, and for the last time recom-
</p>
<p>mended him to retract. But he, looking up to heaven,
</p>
<p>said with a loud voice, ' I call God to witness, that I have
</p>
<p>never either taught or written what those false witnesses
</p>
<p>have laid to my charge. My sermons, my books, my writ-
</p>
<p>ings have all been done with the sole view of rescuing
</p>
<p>souls from the tyranny of sin ; and therefore most joy-
</p>
<p>fully will I confirm with my blood that truth which I have
</p>
<p>taught, written, and preached, and which is confirmed by
</p>
<p>the divine law and the holy fathers. 7
</p>
<p>" The elector and the marshal then withdrew, and fire
</p>
<p>was set to the pile. ' Jesus, Son of the living God,' cried
</p>
<p>John Huss, ' have pity on me ! ' He prayed and sung a
</p>
<p>hymn in the midst of his torments; but soon after, the wind
</p>
<p>having risen, his voice was drowned by the roaring of the
</p>
<p>flames. He was perceived for some time longer moving
</p>
<p>his head and lips, and as if still praying ; and then he
</p>
<p>gave up the spirit. His habits were burned with him ; and
</p>

<p>Of these proceedings the council of Constance are the

<p>real authors. So they regarded the case, and felt them-

</p>
<p>selves called on to defend both themselves and Sigismund.
</p>
<p>To effect this they passed two decrees one relating to
</p>
<p>the impropriety of allowing a safe conduct to arrest trial
</p>
<p>and punishment for heresy ; the other to defend Sigismund
</p>
<p>for his treachery to John Huss, in authorizing his punish-
</p>
<p>TESTIMONY ADDUCED. 55
</p>
<p>ment and giving him up to the magistrates of Constance
</p>
<p>to be burned. In this second decree they not only state
</p>
<p>the doctrine that no faith is to be kept with heretics, but
</p>
<p>solemnly anathematize all who shall dare to call in ques-
</p>
<p>tion the proceedings of the council or of Sigismund.
</p>
<p>Concerning this Gieseler says, " To justify the emperor
</p>
<p>for the infringement of his safe conduct, the council passed
</p>
<p>the shameful decree, that no faith need be held with a
</p>
<p>heretic." The following is a literal translation of these
</p>
<p>decrees :
</p>
<p>" This holy synod declares that no prejudice to the Cath-
</p>
<p>olic faith can or ought to be produced, and no impediment
</p>
<p>to ecclesiastical jurisdiction interposed, by any safe con-
</p>
<p>duct given by the emperor, kings, and other secular pow-
</p>
<p>ers to heretics or those charged with heresy, supposing
</p>
<p>that they shall thus recall them from their errors, what-
</p>
<p>ever be the obligation with which they have bound them-
</p>
<p>selves. But, notwithstanding the said safe conduct, it shall
</p>
<p>be lawful for a competent ecclesiastical judge to inquire
</p>
<p>into the errors of such persons, and to proceed against
</p>
<p>such errors in other ways, according to their deserts, and
</p>
<p>to punish them as much as justice demands if they shall ob-
</p>
<p>stinately refuse to recant their errors, although they came
</p>
<p>to the place of trial relying on the safe conduct, and other-
</p>
<p>wise would not have come."
</p>
<p>The second decree is this :
</p>
<p>"Whereas some ill-informed or ill-disposed persons,
</p>
<p>or some accustomed, perhaps, to think themselves wiser
</p>
<p>than they ought, not only assail his royal majesty with
</p>
<p>slanderous tongues, but even, as it is said, this holy
</p>
<p>council, saying or insinuating, publicly or privately, that
</p>
<p>the safe conduct given by that most unconquerable prince
</p>
<p>Lord Sigismund, King of the Romans and of Hungary,

</p>
<p>to John Huss, that heresiarch of damnable memory, was
</p>
<p>violated when it ought not to have been, contrary to
</p>
<p>justice or honor ; when still the said John Huss, obsti-
</p>
<p>56 THE PAPAL CONSPIEACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>nately assailing the orthodox faith, had rendered him-
</p>
<p>self undeserving of any safe conduct and privilege ; nor
</p>
<p>ought any faith or promise to be observed to him, to the injury
</p>
<p>of the Catholic faith, by any law, natural, divine, or human.
</p>
<p>Therefore the said holy synod, by the terms of this decree,
</p>
<p>declares that the aforesaid most unconquerable prince did
</p>
<p>what was suitable according to the claims of justice, and
</p>
<p>what was becoming his royal majesty, concerning the afore-
</p>
<p>said John Huss, notwithstanding the aforesaid safe con-
</p>
<p>duct ordaining and enjoining on all faithful Christians,
</p>
<p>in general and in particular, that no one hereafter shall
</p>
<p>reproach this sacred council or his royal majesty with
</p>
<p>their conduct towards the aforesaid John Huss, or in any
</p>
<p>way speak to their discredit. But whoever shall do
</p>
<p>otherwise, let him be punished without mercy, as a sup-
</p>
<p>porter of heresy and guilty of treason."
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, therefore, the accumulated protesta-
</p>
<p>tion of the foreign universities to Mr. Pitt and the in-
</p>
<p>dignation of Mr. Brownson, this infallible council has
</p>
<p>taught the doctrine, in theory and practice,, that no faith
</p>
<p>is to be kept with heretics ; and not only so, but they have
</p>
<p>taught it as an article of faith, and declared him worthy
</p>
<p>of punishment without mercy, as a heretic, if he denies it.
</p>
<p>And why should not the council take this ground ?
</p>
<p>Had it not been the avowed principle of the most influ-
</p>
<p>ential pontiffs during that "glorious period," the middle
</p>
<p>ages ? Had not other councils, in effect, decreed the same
</p>
<p>thing ? I shall soon show that they had. If, then, these
</p>
<p>things are so, there is presented to Mr. B., and to all other
</p>
<p>Romanists, this dilemma either to adopt the maxim, or
</p>
<p>to reject the authority of that church which has thus, by
</p>
<p>sanctioning perjury in its basest form, alike invaded the
</p>
<p>most sacred rights and outraged the most holy moral

<p>convictions of God and man.
</p>
<p>Nothing can be more decisive than this testimony ; yet
</p>
<p>I will, for the sake of rendering assurance doubly sure,
</p>
<p>TESTIMONY ADDUCED. 57
</p>
<p>proceed to adduce more " facts, names, and dates " on the
</p>
<p>points involved. My additional witnesses will be Urban
</p>
<p>VI., Innocent VIII., Innocent III., and the fourth Lateran
</p>
<p>council.
</p>
<p>POPE URBAN VI. VERSUS 0. A. BROWNSOX.
</p>
<p>It would almost seem to have been the object of Urban
</p>
<p>VI. to contradict Mr. Brownson's assertion in the strongest
</p>
<p>possible terms. He lays down explicitly, and in the most
</p>
<p>general terms possible, that no promises, covenants, leagues,
</p>
<p>or engagements of any kind with heretics are to be re-
</p>
<p>garded as of any binding force.
</p>
<p>But who was Urban VI. ? He sat in the pontifical
</p>
<p>chair from the year 1378 to the year 1389. He was a
</p>
<p>Neapolitan, known by the name of Bartholomew Pregnano
</p>
<p>before he ascended the Papal throne. He is found in
</p>
<p>the list of Bishop Kenrick as the one hundred and ninety-
</p>
<p>eighth pope. In that of M. Daunou he is the two hundred
</p>
<p>and fifth. Both coincide in regarding him as one of the
</p>
<p>genuine successors of Peter, through whom all manner of
</p>
<p>truth and grace has come down even to the present
</p>
<p>generation.
</p>
<p>On the fourth year of his pontificate, on the third day
</p>
<p>of the calends of April, and from the palace of St. Peter
</p>
<p>at Rome, he issued a decree of great moment. To this I
</p>
<p>invite the special attention of Mr. Brownson, and of all
</p>
<p>who desire to judge of Mr. Brownson's orthodoxy as a
</p>
<p>genuine Romanist. It is a matter of no small moment for
</p>
<p>Mr. Brownson to look to it ; for, unless Pope Urban is mis-
</p>
<p>taken, Mr. Brownson is at this time lying beneath the
</p>
<p>indignation of Almighty God, and of the blessed Paul
</p>
<p>and Peter, his apostles, for having dared to infringe and

</p>
<p>contravene the decree of his sovereign lord the pope.
</p>
<p>58 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>As it is thus a matter intimately connected with the
</p>
<p>salvation of his soul, that Mr. Brownson may have all the
</p>
<p>means necessary for ascertaining his deplorable condition,
</p>
<p>I would refer him to the decree in question, in order that
</p>
<p>he may give it a careful examination. He will find it on
</p>
<p>page 352 of the seventh volume of Rymer's Fcedera, begin-
</p>
<p>ning thus : " Urbanus Episcopus, servus servorum Dei, ad
</p>
<p>futuram rei memoriam ; " i. e., " Bishop Urban, the servant
</p>
<p>of the servants of God, in order to keep the thing in
</p>
<p>everlasting remembrance, issues this decree." Mr. Brown-
</p>
<p>son can find a copy of this work in the law library of
</p>
<p>Harvard College, and another in the college library of the
</p>
<p>same institution. From the first I copy the substance of
</p>
<p>the decree.
</p>
<p>From the first and second sections of the decree it ap-
</p>
<p>pears that, to nse the words of Urban, " Winceslaus, King
</p>
<p>of the Romans and of Bohemia, and the most illustrious
</p>
<p>Charles, Emperor of the Romans, had, either simultaneously
</p>
<p>or in succession, entered into and made certain confedera-
</p>
<p>tions, or contracts, or leagues, and agreements with divers
</p>
<p>kings, princes, dukes, counts, chief men, nobles, and certain
</p>
<p>others, and that some of these kings, princes, dukes, counts,
</p>
<p>&c., either then were, or afterwards became, manifest schis-
</p>
<p>matics, or heretics, and separated from the unity of the
</p>
<p>holy Roman and universal church ; " therefore, in view of
</p>
<p>these things, Bishop Urban was filled with deep anxiety
</p>
<p>lest true Romanists should be shaken from the faith by in-
</p>
<p>tercourse with such heretics, and felt himself called on to
</p>
<p>issue this decree, " for the everlasting memory of the thing."
</p>
<p>The great question to be settled, of course, was, in what
</p>
<p>manner ought such confederations, or contracts, or leagues,
</p>
<p>and agreements with heretics to be regarded and treated,
</p>
<p>Are they binding, and to be observed in good faith ? or are

</p>
<p>they null and void ?
</p>
<p>TESTIMONY ADDUCED. 59
</p>
<p>In these circumstances, and with reference to this ques-
</p>
<p>tion, Pope Urban issued his decree, and closed it with the
</p>
<p>solemn assurance that the wrath of Almighty God, and of
</p>
<p>the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, would rest on those
</p>
<p>who with impious temerity should dare to resist or infringe
</p>
<p>it. Now, that this is the very thing that Mr. Brownson
</p>
<p>has done, I propose next to show. Let us, then, attend to
</p>
<p>the solemn decision of the pope upon a point so grave.
</p>
<p>He first proceeds in the most explicit and solemn manner
</p>
<p>to state the general principles on which his decision was
</p>
<p>to be based, and then to apply them to the case in question.
</p>
<p>Notice his words :
</p>
<p>" We therefore, in view of the fact that confederations, or
</p>
<p>contracts, or- leagues, and agreements made with heretics of
</p>
<p>this kind, or with schismatics, after they have become such,
</p>
<p>are unreasonable, unlawful, and of right to be regarded as
</p>
<p>not existing, (even although they may have been made be-
</p>
<p>fore they fell into schism or heresy ;) and although they
</p>
<p>may have been confirmed by an oath, or a solemn pledge
</p>
<p>of fidelity, or by an apostolic confirmation, OB STRENGTH-
</p>
<p>ENED BY ANY OTHER CONFIRMATION," &C. So much for
</p>
<p>the statement of principles. And surely it is sufficiently
</p>
<p>explicit to satisfy even the most confirmed sceptic.
</p>
<p>Now for the practical application. On such grounds
</p>
<p>the pontiff proceeds solemnly to declare, that " the king
</p>
<p>and others who together with him may have entered into
</p>
<p>or made such confederations, or contracts, or leagues, and
</p>
<p>agreements, and to whom such confederations, or contracts,
</p>
<p>or leagues, and agreements can be extended, or who have
</p>
<p>or can have any interest in them, are absolved from them,
</p>
<p>and OUGHT NOT TO OBSERVE THEM."

</p>
<p>Nor is this all. In the third section the pontiff enjoini
</p>
<p>60 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>it upon the king to assail such heretics with his whole
</p>
<p>power, on the ground that all communion with them 13
</p>
<p>dangerous to the soul.
</p>
<p>In the fourth section he declares that he is animated by
</p>
<p>a motive similar to that which Mr. Brownson avows as
</p>
<p>the mainspring of his zeal i. e., an earnest desire of
</p>
<p>saving the soul of the king and of others from ruin by-
</p>
<p>heresy.
</p>
<p>In order, therefore, to effect so laudable a purpose, he
</p>
<p>proceeds in the fifth section, in due form, to absolve the
</p>
<p>king and all others from all obligation of any sort to keep
</p>
<p>foith with heretics. Listen to his words : " We therefore,
</p>
<p>by the tenor of these letters and by apostolic authority,
</p>
<p>declare that the aforesaid king, and all others who are- or
</p>
<p>can be concerned, have been and are wholly absolved from
</p>
<p>the observance of such confederations, or contracts, or
</p>
<p>leagues, and agreements, and are not bound to observe
</p>
<p>them in the least degree. Moreover, so far as, de facto,
</p>
<p>they have proceeded in them, we invalidate them, render
</p>
<p>them void, and declare them to be destitute of all binding
</p>
<p>power."
</p>
<p>/
</p>
<p>Nor is this enough. As if to make assurance doubly
</p>
<p>sure, in the great work of saving souls, he proceeds in the
</p>
<p>sixth section absolutely to forbid the observance of such
</p>
<p>leagues and agreements. " Moreover, to avert dangers from
</p>
<p>the soul of the Icing and all others concerned, we utterly forbid
</p>
<p>them at all to regard such confederations, contracts, leagues,
</p>
<p>and agreements, or to suffer them to be regarded by ot/iers."
</p>
<p>He then elevates his mind to the contemplation of future
</p>
<p>ages,.and considers the probability that ignorant or wicked
</p>
<p>men, like Mr. Brownson, will assail the sublime principles

</p>
<p>thus promulgated, and binds them to desist by a solemn
</p>
<p>TESTIMONY ADDUCED. 61
</p>
<p>decree. Thus in the seventh section he proceeds : " We
</p>
<p>decree that from this time, whatever shall be attempted in
</p>
<p>opposition to us, by whomsoever undertaken, or by what-
</p>
<p>ever authority, and whether ignorantly or intelligently,
</p>
<p>shall be utterly devoid of authority and force."
</p>
<p>Then in the eighth section follows his final warning to
</p>
<p>all ages against so great a crime, and a denunciation of
</p>
<p>his highest anathemas against its authors. " Let no man
</p>
<p>dare to infringe this declaration or with foolhardy au-
</p>
<p>dacity rush against it. But if any one shall presume to
</p>
<p>attempt this deed, let him know that he will surely incur
</p>
<p>the indignation of Almighty God and of his blessed
</p>
<p>apostles Peter and Paul."
</p>
<p>" Sub filis sericis Flavi, Rubique coloris, De Curia T.
</p>
<p>Frabi."
</p>
<p>The margin of Rymer informs us that the document in
</p>
<p>question was copied from the original autographs. Who,
</p>
<p>now, can read this decree and not be struck with the im-
</p>
<p>minent peril in which the soul of Mr. Brownson is placed ?
</p>
<p>For he has not only, dared in general to oppose the prin-
</p>
<p>ciples of this decree, but utterly to denounce them as im-
</p>
<p>pious and profane. Professor Park had ascribed to the
</p>
<p>Roman Catholic church the advocacy of the very princi-
</p>
<p>ples so clearly set forth by Pope Urban ; and Mr. Brown-
</p>
<p>son, instead of recognizing them and standing up like a
</p>
<p>man in defence of his sovereign lord the pope, Peter-like
</p>
<p>denies him and Judas-like betrays him. Listen to his
</p>
<p>daring words :
</p>
<p>" ' No faith to be kept with heretics.' Where did the
</p>
<p>professor learn that this is a maxim of Catholicity? It
</p>
<p>is false. Catholicity knows no such maxim, and Catho-
</p>
<p>lic history authorizes no inference that she practically
</p>
<p>adopts or in the least conceivable manner countenances'

</p>
<p>it. Individuals of bad faith may be found, no doubt, even
</p>
<p>among Catholics ; but that Catholicity or Catholic doc-
</p>
<p>G2 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>tors any where countenance any thing of the sort is a
</p>
<p>malignant falsehood. We are taught and required to
</p>
<p>keep our faith with all men ; and faith plighted to a here-
</p>
<p>tic can no more be broken without sin than faith plighted
</p>
<p>to a true believer. We would that Protestants would
</p>
<p>observe a tithe of the good faith towards Catholics that
</p>
<p>Catholics do towards Protestants ; and, when they shall
</p>
<p>do so, we give them free leave to abuse our morals to
</p>
<p>their full satisfaction."
</p>
<p>Here Mr. Brownson boldly declares that the maxim,
</p>
<p>" that no faith is to be kept with heretics," is not a maxim
</p>
<p>of Catholicity, and manifests an utter detestation of it.
</p>
<p>Pope Urban declares that it is. Mr. Brownson declares
</p>
<p>that " Catholic history authorizes no inference that she
</p>
<p>practically adopts or in the least conceivable manner coun-
</p>
<p>tenances it." Pope Urban declares that the wrath of
</p>
<p>Almighty God and the blessed apostles Peter and Paul
</p>
<p>shall rest upon all who dare to assail so fundamental a
</p>
<p>doctrine. Mr. Brownson plainly declares that keeping
</p>
<p>faith with heretics is a duty, and intimates that it is essen-
</p>
<p>tial to the salvation of the soul. Pope Urban declares
</p>
<p>that it is a crime, and enjoins the duty of violating faith
</p>
<p>with heretics as essential to save the soul. Thus we see
</p>
<p>that there is a direct and fatal collision between Pope
</p>
<p>Urban VI. and Orestes A. Brownson, and that, if Pope Ur-
</p>
<p>ban is right, the wrath of God is resting on Mr. Brownson.
</p>
<p>Let no one say that there was no general council assem-
</p>
<p>bled to confirm this decision of Pope Urban. It was given
</p>
<p>ex cathedra, and was acquiesced in by all the bishops with-
</p>
<p>out any known dissent. It is, therefore, a solemn decision
</p>
<p>of the church ; and it is sustained by councils in abun-
</p>
<p>dance.
</p>
<p>And now let Mr. Brownson recall his public declara-
</p>

</p>
<p>tions of his entire submission to the authority of the pope.
</p>
<p>He has openly declared that for him it is liberty enough
</p>
<p>TESTIMONY ADDUCED. 63
</p>
<p>to think as the pope thinks. And, in view of all the facts
</p>
<p>in the premises, let him, if he dares, candidly answer the
</p>
<p>following questions :
</p>
<p>1. Does he believe that Pope Urban spoke the truth of
</p>
<p>God, or that he promulgated the doctrines of devils ?
</p>
<p>2. If he spoke the truth of God, then is not Mr. Brown-
</p>
<p>sou under the wrath of Almighty God and of the blessed
</p>
<p>apostles Peter and Paul for his impious statements above
</p>
<p>quoted ? And, as he is very anxious to save his soul,
</p>
<p>ought he not at once and publicly to recant them ?
</p>
<p>3. If Pope Urban spoke the doctrines of devils, then is
</p>
<p>not his whole decree a specimen of the highest impiety
</p>
<p>and blasphemy ever uttered in the name of God ?
</p>
<p>4. Of what use is a head of the church when it is
</p>
<p>necessary to reject his blasphemies to save the soul ?
</p>
<p>5. By what rule can it be decided whether a pope
</p>
<p>speaks the truth of God or utters the blasphemies of the
</p>
<p>devil ?
</p>
<p>If Mr. Brownson "will devote his energies to a careful
</p>
<p>investigation of these questions, and will give them an
</p>
<p>honest answer, then for his reward I will continue to pro-
</p>
<p>pose similar questions till he shall have had a full oppor-
</p>
<p>tunity to illustrate to the whole American people one of
</p>
<p>the most important and practical questions of the age.

<p>POPE INXOCEXT VIII. AXD THE WALDENSES.
</p>
<p>We have seen, in the case of John Huss, and of Winces-
</p>
<p>laus, and Charles, that the principle, "no faith is to be
</p>
<p>kept with heretics," was not a mere theoretical principle.
</p>
<p>It had a dread practical power. Nor are these solitary
</p>
<p>instances of its terrific operation.

<p>The fate of the Waldenses is too familiar to need an
</p>
<p>64 TIIE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>elaborate historical narration. I will simply present the
</p>
<p>principles on which the head of the church dealt with
</p>
<p>that people, whose only crime was disobedience to the
</p>
<p>see of Rome.
</p>
<p>Pope Innocent VIII., in preparing to consign to death,
</p>
<p>not one martyr, but a whole body of Christians, thus com-
</p>
<p>missions Albert de Capitaneis, Archdeacon of the church
</p>
<p>of Cremona, as nuncio and commissioner of the apostolic
</p>
<p>see, to labor, in concert with the inquisitor general, in the
</p>
<p>extermination of the Waldenses. The pope subjects' to

</p>
<p>vicars and chief officers. If ever a pope was called on to
</p>
<p>act on the real principles of the church, it was in such a
</p>
<p>case. For what end, then, are all these church powers
</p>
<p>subjected to the legate of the pope ? Hear him :
</p>
<p>" In order that they may be obliged with you and the
</p>
<p>said inquisitor to take up arms against the said Walden-
</p>
<p>ses and other heretics, and to come to an understanding
</p>
<p>to crush them like venomous asps, and to contribute all
</p>
<p>in their care to so HOLY and so necessary an extermi-
</p>
<p>nation."
</p>
<p>After this, can any one expect that any faith will be
</p>
<p>kept with men all of whose rights are thus exterminated
</p>
<p>at one blow ? The head of the Romish corporation then
</p>
<p>proceeds to overturn all foundations of morality by ex-
</p>
<p>cusing and sanctioning the sins of those who will labor
</p>
<p>to exterminate the Waldenses, and declaring in express
</p>
<p>terms that none are under any obligation to keep faith
</p>
<p>with heretics.

<p>" Given at Rome, at St. Peter's, the year of the in-
</p>
<p>carnation of our Lord 1487, fifth of the calends of May,
</p>
<p>and the thirteenth year of our pontificate."
</p>
<p>Let it be noticed here that we are not now considering
</p>
<p>an individual of bad faith here and there among the
</p>
<p>Catholics, such as Mr. Brownson admits may be found,
</p>
<p>but the head of the church, laying down principles on
</p>
<p>which all Romanists were to act. He authorizes his
</p>
<p>legate to declare that it is lawful to seize on t/ie property,
</p>
<p>reed or personal, of the heretics, and to declare that all
</p>
<p>who may be held and obliged by contract or other manner
</p>
<p>to pay them any thing are not for the future in any way
</p>
<p>obliged to do so ; to absolve those who have sworn to favor
</p>
<p>the heretics, provided, talcing t/ie contrary oath, they pr,om-
</p>
<p>ise to abstain most carefully from doing so. Here robbery,
</p>
<p>cheating, and perjury towards heretics in their grossest
</p>
<p>forms are authorized by the head of the Romish corpora-
</p>
<p>tion ; and in his bull the whole corporation and church
</p>
<p>acquiesced : no dissent, no protest, was heard. Nay, more :
</p>
<p>they carried out these principles, to their utmost extent,
</p>
<p>without mitigation and without mercy. It is, therefore,
</p>
<p>the voice of the Romish church and her act. And yet, in
</p>
<p>view of such facts, Mr. Brownson has the audacity to say,
</p>
<p>"'No faith to be kept with heretics.' Where did the
</p>
<p>professor learn that this is a maxim of Catholicity? It
</p>
<p>is false. Catholicity knows no such maxim, and Catholic
</p>
<p>history authorizes no inference that she practically adopts
</p>
<p>or in the least conceivable manner countenances it."
</p>
<p>Is it to be supposed that Mr. Brownsou was ignorant of
</p>
<p>these facts? Or was he acting on the principle, that a lie
</p>
<p>for ecclesiastical utility is both defensible and meritorious?

<p>If the latter, he is a proficient in this kind of morality.

</p>
<p>POPE INNOCENT III. AND A GENERAL COUNCIL.
</p>
<p>But let us go back a little farther, and we come to
</p>
<p>another of the Innocents, who seem to have delighted to
</p>
<p>exhibit the highest possible contrast between their name
</p>
<p>and their deeds. We come to Innocent III. Let us listen
</p>
<p>to him, for in his days the Papal corporation was at the
</p>
<p>summit of its power ; and if it had any ideas of fidelity or
</p>
<p>mercy towards those weak and defenceless Christians
</p>
<p>whom they stigmatized as heretics, then it ought to have
</p>
<p>developed itself. Hear him, then : " Whoever are bound
</p>
<p>to those who have manifestly fallen into heresy by any
</p>
<p>compact, confirmed by any degree of strength whatever,
</p>
<p>let them know that they are absolved from all duty of
</p>
<p>fidelity, homage, and all kinds of obedience to them."
</p>
<p>These are the words of Innocent ; and from his decree
</p>
<p>the principle passed into the canon law, from which I have
</p>
<p>already quoted it, and where it still stands ; so that it
</p>
<p>has not only the authority of Innocent, but of all the
</p>
<p>popes who have sanctioned the canon law.
</p>
<p>Nor is this all : the fourth council of the Lateran, 1215,
</p>
<p>representing the whole of Christendom, has sanctioned
</p>
<p>the same principle. Of this council Innocent III. was the
</p>
<p>lord and life ; they did but register his decisions. Yet
</p>
<p>the decisions of a pope, acquiesced in by a general coun-
</p>
<p>cil, are those of the church ; and the decisions of this coun-
</p>
<p>cil as to heretics have also been transferred to the canon
</p>
<p>law, as any one may see who will compare cap. iii. De
</p>
<p>Hereticis of the council with Decret. Greg., lib. v. tit. vii.
</p>
<p>capit. xiii.-xv.
</p>
<p>They in the first place anathematize all heretics simply
</p>
<p>on the ground of heresy ; and in the whole chapter they

<p>say nothing of any other offence. No sin against morals

<p>68 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>or good order is referred to ; the only sin is heresy.
</p>
<p>Hear them : " We excommunicate and anathematize all
</p>
<p>heresy that shall lift itself up against this sacred ortho-
</p>
<p>dox Catholic faith which we have already set forth. We
</p>
<p>condemn all heresies by whatever names they may be
</p>
<p>called, fades quidem habentes diversas, sed caudas ad in-
</p>
<p>vicem colligatas, quia de vanitate communicant in idipsum."
</p>
<p>I give the elegant Latin of Innocent and the council in
</p>
<p>part, that all may judge of the translation. It means,
</p>
<p>" Having faces diverse, but tails tied together, because in
</p>
<p>their vain conceptions they hold to the same thing in
</p>
<p>essence i. e., the condemned heretics in aspect are vari-
</p>
<p>ous, but agree in the belief of radical error." The coun-
</p>
<p>cil then proceeds to the annihilation of all their rights
</p>
<p>by consigning them to death, and then also to annihilate
</p>
<p>the rights of their defenders, or friends, by cutting every
</p>
<p>tie by which they are bound to human society unless they
</p>
<p>assail the heretics, and by laying them open to every
</p>
<p>possible aggression and insult, even if they are not cut off
</p>
<p>by a cruel and violent death.
</p>
<p>" Let all the secular powers be led, and if necessary
</p>
<p>forced by ecclesiastical censure, to take an oath in public
</p>
<p>for the defence of the faith, swearing to exert themselves
</p>
<p>to exterminate from the countries subject to their jurisdic-
</p>
<p>tion all the heretics designated by the church. Eah
</p>
<p>person, when he has received any authority, whether spir-
</p>
<p>itual or temporal, shall be bound to take this oath.
</p>
<p>Should any temporal lord, when warned by the church,
</p>
<p>neglect to purge his country of the stain of heresy, let
</p>
<p>him be excommunicated by the archbishop and the pro-
</p>
<p>vincial bishops ; and, should he refuse to give satisfaction
</p>
<p>within the year, let advice be given of it to the sovereign
</p>
<p>pontiff, in order that he may free the said lord's vassals

<p>having exterminated the heretics. Catholics who shall
</p>
<p>take the cross to exterminate heretics shall enjoy the same
</p>
<p>indulgences and the same holy privilege as they who
</p>
<p>fight the infidels. He who listens to unbelievers, receives,
</p>
<p>defends, and aids them, is excommunicated like them, and,
</p>
<p>after a year has revolved, becomes infamous ipso jure. He
</p>
<p>cannot from that moment be called to public employments
</p>
<p>or councils ; he cannot rote for the election of inquisitors
</p>
<p>or councillors ; he cannot even be admitted as a witness ;
</p>
<p>he loses all faculty of acting as witness to a will, or of
</p>
<p>accepting an inheritance or legacy. No person shall be
</p>
<p>bound to appear before a court of law at his suit for any
</p>
<p>affair whatever ; but he shall be forced to appear at the
</p>
<p>demand of every one. Should he -be a judge, his sen-
</p>
<p>tences shall not have any force, and no suit can legally be
</p>
<p>brought before his tribunal ; if an advocate, he shall not
</p>
<p>be permitted to defend : if a notary, the acts which he
</p>
<p>passes shall be of no value, and they shall be condemned
</p>
<p>with him who drew them. * * * All that shall not fly
</p>
<p>those whom the church shall have thus noted shall also be
</p>
<p>excommunicated : priests are not to administer to them
</p>
<p>the holy sacraments, or give them ecclesiastical burial, or
</p>
<p>receive their gifts and offerings, under pain of depo-
</p>
<p>sition."
</p>
<p>All this and more still stands in full force in the records
</p>
<p>of the fourth Lateran council and in the canon law of
</p>
<p>Home. And yet Mr. Brownson has the assurance to tell
</p>
<p>us that it is no part of Romanism.
</p>
<p>Her more general maxim, that no oath contrary to ec-
</p>
<p>clesiastical utility is binding, I shall now proceed to con-

<p>sider.

<p>We have considered some of the evidence furnished by
</p>
<p>popes, general councils, and the canon law, that Romanism
</p>
<p>did adopt and sanction, both in theory and practice, that
</p>
<p>70 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>no faith is to be kept with heretics. "We have seen, too,
</p>
<p>in the case of John Huss and the Waldenses, that mere
</p>
<p>doctrinal correctness and exemplary piety were no defence
</p>
<p>against the charge of heresy, if the authority of the pope
</p>
<p>and the Roman corporation were denied. This arrogant
</p>
<p>and usurping corporation has, in all ages, made obedience
</p>
<p>to themselves the chief test of orthodoxy. Give them
</p>
<p>supreme power to rule and tax the Christian world, and
</p>
<p>all is well, even though the clergy shall be a disgrace to
</p>
<p>the name of God and a scandal to the civilized world.
</p>
<p>This is the key to the unspeakable bitterness and cruelty
</p>
<p>with which that corporation has hunted down heretics
</p>
<p>from age to age. They have arrogated to themselves the
</p>
<p>place of God upon earth, and made disobedience to their
</p>
<p>authority equivalent to high treason against God, and
</p>
<p>have treated it as a crime so enormous as to forfeit every
</p>
<p>right, and justify every kind of violence and cruelty in
</p>
<p>its extermination. The fundamental element, therefore,
</p>
<p>in this system, is an exaggeration of the importance of the
</p>
<p>Romish corporation above all other interests in the uni-
</p>
<p>verse, be they those of God or man. God has never, even
</p>
<p>for the highest sins against himself, authorized a violation
</p>
<p>of faith ; no, not even to his bitterest enemies. But a re-
</p>
<p>bellion against the Pope and Bishops of Rome is a sin that
</p>
<p>cannot be forgiven ; and to him who is guilty of it, the
</p>
<p>most solemn oaths, vows, and covenants are no defence.
</p>
<p>Pope Urban tells us they must be regarded as not in ex-
</p>
<p>istence. Nothing must be allowed to shield the guilty
</p>
<p>rebel from the bloody vengeance of Rome. Such is the
</p>
<p>real philosophy of this maxim of that abandoned and
</p>
<p>profligate corporation.
</p>
<p>But the same cause that led to this specific principle
</p>
<p>would lead, of necessity, to a principle still more general ;

</p>
<p>i. e., that no oath contrary to ecclesiastical utility is of
</p>
<p>TESTIMONY ADDUCED. 71
</p>
<p>any force ; that is, all principles of truth and integrity in
</p>
<p>the universe are of less importance than the interests of
</p>
<p>the Romish corporation. Moreover, of what these inter-
</p>
<p>ests demand, that corporation is the only judge. That
</p>
<p>this maxim, also, has been adopted and practised on by
</p>
<p>that corporation, there is evidence ample and explicit.
</p>
<p>The principle is laid down in express terms in the canon
</p>
<p>law, Decret. Greg., lib. ii. tit. xxiv. cap. xxvii. : " Juramen-
</p>
<p>tum contra utUitatem ecclesiasticam prcestitum non tenet."
</p>
<p>" An oath taken contrary to ECCLESIASTICAL UTILITY is not
</p>
<p>binding." This is the general principle, as stated in the
</p>
<p>caption of the canon. In the body the principle is thus
</p>
<p>expressed : " Non j uramenta sed perjuria potius sunt dicenda,
</p>
<p>qiiae, contra utUitatem ecclesiasticam adtentantur." " Oaths
</p>
<p>taken contrary to ecclesiastical utility are not to be re-
</p>
<p>garded as oaths, but perjuries." This part of the canon
</p>
<p>law is taken from the decisions of the notorious Innocent
</p>
<p>III., the same who first laid down in scientific form the
</p>
<p>detestable maxim, that no faith is to be kept with heretics.
</p>
<p>Still, however, he is not entitled to the infamy of origi-
</p>
<p>nating the maxim in its present form. This infamy prop-
</p>
<p>erly belongs to the third Lateran council, under Alexander
</p>
<p>III. - It there occurs in this form : "Non enim dicenda sunt
</p>
<p>juramenta sed potius perjuria, qua contra utUitatem ecclesias-
</p>
<p>ticam, et sanctorum patrum veniunt institua." " Those oaths
</p>
<p>which operate against ecclesiastical utility and the insti-
</p>
<p>tutions of the holy fathers are not to be called oaths, but
</p>
<p>rather perjuries." Here, then, there is a concurrence of a
</p>
<p>general council, the decrees of Innocent III., and the au-
</p>
<p>thority of all the popes who have sanctioned the canon
</p>
<p>law, in establishing this as a maxim of the Romish corpo-
</p>
<p>ration. And, inasmuch as they are the only judges of

<p>what ecclesiastical utility is, this principle gives them full
</p>
<p>72 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>power to dissolve all oaths of every kind which they
</p>
<p>deem inconsistent with their own interests.
</p>
<p>A principle more thoroughly immoral and profligate
</p>
<p>than this cannot be conceived. But it was not one whit
</p>
<p>more immoral and profligate than the practice to which
</p>
<p>it gave rise. Hallam remarks, with no less truth than
</p>
<p>severity, that " this maxim gave the most unlimited priv-
</p>
<p>ilege to the popes of breaking all faith of treaties which
</p>
<p>thwarted their interest or passion a privilege which
</p>
<p>they continually exercised."
</p>
<p>HISTORICAL ILLUSTRATIONS. THOMAS A BECKET.
</p>
<p>Let us, then, for a commentary on this principle, turn to
</p>
<p>the page of history. During the pontificate of this same
</p>
<p>Alexander III., Henry II., of England, established, at the
</p>
<p>council of Clarendon, certain ordinances designed to de-
</p>
<p>fend the rights of the king and civil powers of England
</p>
<p>over the clergy, against the arrogant invasions of the Pa-
</p>
<p>pacy. Thomas a Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, sol-
</p>
<p>emnly accepted and signed these ; but the pope decided
</p>
<p>that they were against "ecclesiastical utility." Becket
</p>
<p>forthwith professed sorrow for his oath to the pope, and
</p>
<p>the pope absolved him from it. What the meaning of ec-
</p>
<p>clesiastical utility is in this case, in the opinion of Alex-
</p>
<p>ander III., the lord of the third Lateran council, is per-
</p>
<p>fectly plain. It is the right to exempt his bishops and
</p>
<p>clergy from the control of the civil government under
</p>
<p>which they live, in a manner which not an existing gov-
</p>
<p>ernment on earth will now allow. The ordinances of
</p>
<p>Henry II. were right. The oath of Thomas a Becket was

</p>
<p>not in opposition to the law of God, but in strict accord-

</p>
<p>ance with it ; for God commands ecclesiastics, as well as
</p>
<p>others, to be subject to the laws of their legitimate civil
</p>
<p>rulers. The pope, therefore, authorized and required of
</p>
<p>Becket perjury ; and the Archbishop of Canterbury did
</p>
<p>perjure himself out of a regard to ecclesiastical utility ;
</p>
<p>that is, the ambitious plans of the pope.
</p>
<p>POPE PASCAL II.
</p>
<p>But in doing this he followed illustrious precedents.
</p>
<p>Pope Pascal II. carried on a long conflict with Henry V.
</p>
<p>on the subject of investitures. At last Henry took him
</p>
<p>captive, and would not release him till he and sixteen car-
</p>
<p>dinals signed a treaty, by which he guarantied to the em-
</p>
<p>peror the right of investiture, provided he mingled no
</p>
<p>simony with it. He also crowned the emperor, and sol-
</p>
<p>emnly bound himself never to excommunicate him. The
</p>
<p>oath was taken in the most solemn form conceivable. The
</p>
<p>communion was celebrated at the time of the coronation.
</p>
<p>When the host was broken, the pope, taking a part, and
</p>
<p>giving a part to the emperor, said, " As this part of the
</p>
<p>living body is divided, so let him be divided from the
</p>
<p>kingdom of Christ and of God who shall attempt to vio-
</p>
<p>late this covenant." Nor was this all : the pope, after he
</p>
<p>had regained his liberty, renewed the same oath. (See Dau-
</p>
<p>nou, Court of Rome, p. 98.) Here, then, we have the head

</p>
<p>more with one so solemnly sanctioned over the body ol
</p>
<p>Christ.
</p>
<p>But before "ecclesiastical utility" what can stand?
</p>
<p>The most solemn oaths, touched by this magic wand, be-
</p>
<p>eome a rope of sand. The oath of Pascal brought upon
</p>
<p>aim the bitter censures of the Roman clergy. Hear, now,
</p>
<p>the narrative of the sequel, from the powerful and justly
</p>
<p>earcastic pen of a Roman Catholic : "Now, the head of
</p>
<p>the church suffers himself to be accused of double dealing.
</p>
<p>He retires to Terracina to weep over his sin. He suffers
</p>
<p>the cardinals to annul his decrees and promises. He is
</p>
<p>going (so he says) to abdicate the tiara. Happily this
</p>
<p>purpose is opposed ; and such is the docility of the pon-
</p>
<p>tiff, that he consents with resignation to retain the power,
</p>
<p>so that he may have the opportunity to make a better use
</p>
<p>of it. Finally, in a council, he revoked the treaty which
</p>
<p>he had the misfortune to subscribe. Nevertheless he re-
</p>
<p>fuses personally to excommunicate Henry V., so great, even
</p>
<p>yet, were his scruples to violate an engagement. The
</p>
<p>cardinals, they pronounced this anathema in the presence
</p>
<p>of Pascal." Daunou, p. 99.
</p>
<p>The records of the council in Binius show that Pascal
</p>
<p>submitted all his proceedings to the council and that they
</p>
<p>absolved him from his oath. "We all," say they, "in
</p>
<p>this sacred council, assembled with our lord the pope, in
</p>
<p>accordance with the decision of the Holy Spirit, condemn
</p>
<p>it (i. e., the covenant) with canonical censure and by ec-
</p>
<p>clesiastical authority. We decide that it is null and void.
</p>
<p>We annihilate its binding force ; and, that it may be utter-
</p>
<p>ly destitute of authority and power, we utterly excommu-
</p>
<p>nicate (!) it."
</p>
<p>" When this result was read, the whole council cried
</p>
<p>out, Amen ! Amen ! So be it ! so be it ! " Binius, vol. iii.

</p>
<p>What oath now can stand before such principles of per-
</p>
<p>jury ? If the highest ecclesiastic swears a solemn oath to
</p>
<p>his king, the pope can absolve him from it. If the pope
</p>
<p>swears a solemn oath to an emperor, he has only to call a
</p>
<p>council, and they absolve him from it. In blasphemous
</p>
<p>mockery of the Holy Ghost, they dissolve and excommu-
</p>
<p>nicate the oath by his divine authority.
</p>
<p>THE PROCESS SIMPLIFIED. PAUL IV. AND OTHERS.
</p>
<p>But at last it was discovered that this formality of a
</p>
<p>council was needless. The pope found out that he not
</p>
<p>only had the authority to absolve others from their oaths,
</p>
<p>but that he had also full authority to absolve himself from
</p>
<p>any oath whatever. This greatly simplified the whole
</p>
<p>business. Take an example from Edgar, Variations, p.
</p>
<p>249 : "Paul IV., in 1555. absolved himself from an oath
</p>
<p>which he had taken in the conclave. His holiness had
</p>
<p>sworn to make only four cardinals, but violated his obli-
</p>
<p>gation. His supremacy declared that the pontiff could
</p>
<p>not be bound, or his authority limited, even by an oath. The
</p>
<p>contrary he characterizes ' as a manifest heresy.' " (Paolo,
</p>
<p>ii. xxvii.) Indeed, so common was it to violate solemn oaths
</p>
<p>taken in conclave among the cardinals before election,
</p>
<p>binding whoever was elected pope to comply with certain
</p>
<p>conditions, that it became the regular course of events.
</p>
<p>Indeed, I am not aware that any pope was ever guilty, in
</p>
<p>such circumstances, of the heresy of feeling himself bound
</p>
<p>by the most solemn oath that it is possible to take.
</p>
<p>Of course the principle of ecclesiastical utility was ex-
</p>
<p>tended to all other oaths that were deemed injurious to
</p>
<p>the interests of the Romish corporation. Edgar, p. 251,

</p>
<p>illustrates this use of the principle : " Clement, in 1526,
</p>
<p>76 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>absolved Francis II., the French king, from a treaty which
</p>
<p>he had formed in Spain. The Emperor of Germany had
</p>
<p>taken his Christian majesty a prisoner in the battle of
</p>
<p>Pavia and carried him to Madrid. The conditions of his
</p>
<p>engagement, which were disadvantageous, Francis con-
</p>
<p>firmed by an oath. This engagement, however, the pon-
</p>
<p>tiff, by his apostolic power, soon dissolved, for the purpose
</p>
<p>of gaining the French king as an ally in a holy confed-
</p>
<p>eracy which his infallibility had organized against the
</p>
<p>German emperor." Before " ecclesiastical utility " the
</p>
<p>power of a solemn oath, not to a heretic, but to a Cath-
</p>
<p>olic king, melted away.
</p>
<p>Of course a Mahometan sultan could expect no better
</p>
<p>treatment. Ladislaus, King of Hungary, formed a treaty
</p>
<p>with the Sultan Amurath, and the king and sultan con-
</p>
<p>firmed it by mutual oaths on the Gospels and the Koran.
</p>
<p>Eugenius IV., by his legate Julian, declared it in the high-
</p>
<p>est degree criminal to observe an oath so much opposed to
</p>
<p>" ecclesiastical utility." " I absolve you," said the legate,
</p>
<p>" from perjury, and sanctify your arms." " The sultan, it
</p>
<p>is said, displayed a copy of the violated treaty in the front
</p>
<p>of battle, implored the protection of the God of truth, and
</p>
<p>called aloud on the prophet Jesus to avenge the mockery
</p>
<p>of his religion and authority." (Edgar, p. 251.) The re-
</p>
<p>sult was the defeat and death of Ladislaus. When all liars
</p>
<p>are cast into the lake of fire, where will Eugenius, the
</p>
<p>teacher of perjury, be found ?
</p>
<p>Take another instance from Hallam, Middle Ages, p. 293,
</p>
<p>note. Piccininio, the famous condottiere of the fifteenth
</p>
<p>century, had promised not to attack Francis Sforza, at
</p>
<p>that time at war with the pope. Eugenius IV. (the same
</p>
<p>excellent person who had annulled the compactata with the
</p>
<p>Hussites, releasing those who had sworn to them, and who

</p>
<p>afterwards made the King of Hungary break his treaty
</p>
<p>TESTIMONY ADDUCED. 77
</p>
<p>with Amurath II.) absolves him from his promise, on the
</p>
<p>express ground that a treaty disadvantageous to the
</p>
<p>church ought not to be kept.
</p>
<p>Of course, if " ecclesiastical utility " can dissolve oaths
</p>
<p>of popes, archbishops, and kings, it can dissolve all oaths
</p>
<p>of allegiance, not merely to heretical rulers, but to all
</p>
<p>who act against the ambition, pride, or passions of the
</p>
<p>pope.
</p>
<p>On this ground, Gregory VII., in the third Roman coun-
</p>
<p>cil, excommunicated Henry IV., and dissolved all oaths
</p>
<p>of allegiance between him and his subjects. His words
</p>
<p>are : " I absolve all Christians from the obligations of the
</p>
<p>oath which they have taken or shall take to him, and I
</p>
<p>forbid any one to obey him as king." The same thing was
</p>
<p>repeated in the seventh Roman council. Nor has the
</p>
<p>church of Rome ever condemned these proceedings. Nay,
</p>
<p>Paul V. canonized Gregory VII., and inserted an office in
</p>
<p>the Roman breviary praising his holiness " for freeing the
</p>
<p>Emperor Henry's subjects from the oath of fidelity." Thus
</p>
<p>the praise of the doctrine of perjury was solemnly intro-
</p>
<p>duced into the worship of the Romish church. Alexander,
</p>
<p>Clement, and Benedict sanctioned the transactions of
</p>
<p>Paul.
</p>
<p>The same doctrine was sanctioned by the coincident ac-
</p>
<p>tion of the first general council of Lyons, and the pope,
</p>
<p>the highest authority in the Romish church. Innocent
</p>
<p>IV., in the presence of the sacred council, pronounced
</p>
<p>sentence of deposition on Frederic II., and declared all
</p>
<p>his subjects absolved from their oaths of allegiance ; for-
</p>
<p>bade any to obey or aid him as emperor or king ; and de-
</p>
<p>clared that all who should be guilty of obeying or aiding
</p>
<p>him should, ipso facto, be excommunicated, and directed
</p>
<p>the electors to choose a successor. But there is not room

<p>to give in detail the particulars and the results of this
</p>
<p>78 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>abominable transaction. Nor have I designed to detail
</p>
<p>all the cases in which the same principles were reduced to
</p>
<p>practice by the popes and councils from the time of Greg-
</p>
<p>ory VII. to Pius VII.' Time would fail me to complete
</p>
<p>such an enumeration. It would present at least twenty
</p>
<p>cases of teaching perjury on the great scale, by professing
</p>
<p>to dissolve national oaths. But the facts are too noto-
</p>
<p>rious to need more than a general reference.
</p>
<p>THE FINAL ISSUE.
</p>
<p>What, then, will Mr. Brownson say ? Will he admit
</p>
<p>that the popes and general councils of the Romish church
</p>
<p>did, in the name of God, mislead the whole world for
</p>
<p>centuries on the most fundamental point of morals and
</p>
<p>religion ? or will he defend their doctrine ? One or the
</p>
<p>other he must do ; for the facts admit of no denial.
</p>
<p>Is the pope indeed the vicar of God ? Does he, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to the canon law, " fill the place, not of a mere man,
</p>
<p>but of the true God on earth " ? (" Non puri hominis sed
</p>
<p>veri Dei vicem gerit in terris ; " Decret. Greg., lib. i. tit. vii.
</p>
<p>cap. iii.) Then let Mr. Brownson listen to the voice of
</p>
<p>Gregory as he inveighs "against the insanity of those who
</p>
<p>with impious mouth prate that the authority of the sacred
</p>
<p>and apostolic see cannot absolve any one from his oath of
</p>
<p>fidelity." (" Contra illorum insaniam, qui, nefando ore,
</p>
<p>garriunt auctoritatem sanctae et apostolicas sedis non po-
</p>
<p>tuisse quemquam a sacramento fidelitatis ejus absolvere.")
</p>
<p>Let him listen to the voice of Innocent X. as he declares
</p>
<p>that " the Roman pontiff can invalidate civil contracts,
</p>
<p>promises,' or oaths made by Catholics to heretics, and that
</p>
<p>simply because they are heretics ; " and " that to deny the

</p>
<p>proposition is heresy and an attack upon the pontifical
</p>
<p>TESTIMONY ADDUCED. 79
</p>
<p>authority in questions relating to the faith, deserving of
</p>
<p>the severest punishment." Let him listen to the voice of
</p>
<p>Gregory IX., the father of the five books of decretals, as
</p>
<p>he declares that " none should keep faith with the person
</p>
<p>who opposes God and the saints." Let him, in addition to
</p>
<p>this, faithfully study the canon law of his own church and
</p>
<p>the decrees of her general councils, and then reconcile
</p>
<p>his own statements with a due regard to historical truth
</p>
<p>if he can. If he was so utterly ignorant of the history
</p>
<p>and principles of his own church as to write what he did
</p>
<p>in sincerity, then an intelligent public can judge how much
</p>
<p>confidence ought to be reposed in his other historical
</p>
<p>statements. If he did understand the history and princi-
</p>
<p>ples of his own church, then either he adopts the maxim,
</p>
<p>that no faith is to be kept with heretics, as an excuse for
</p>
<p>his assertions, or else he has dared to make them without
</p>
<p>even the shadow of an excuse.
</p>
<p>MORAL EFFECTS OF SUCH PRINCIPLES.
</p>
<p>The effects on the morals of the community of such
</p>
<p>principles and such examples as I have described were
</p>
<p>such as might have been expected. When seventeen of
</p>
<p>the heads of the church were perjurers, and popes and
</p>
<p>councils taught perjury on principle, the hope of producing
</p>
<p>in the common mind a sacred regard for truth would be
</p>
<p>just about as reasonable as to suppose that the example
</p>
<p>of the orgies of Venus would produce chastity, or the
</p>
<p>worship of Bacchus temperance.
</p>
<p>Of the eleventh century Guilelmus says, "Faith was not
</p>
<p>found on earth. All flesh had corrupted their way. Jus-
</p>
<p>tice, equity, virtue, sobriety, and the fear of God perished,

<p>and were succeeded by violence, fraud, circumveTition,

</p>
<p>stratagem." In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, ac-
</p>
<p>cording to Morlaix, "Piety and religion seemed to bid
</p>
<p>adieu to man ; and for these were substituted treachery,
</p>
<p>fraud, impurity, rapine, schism, quarrels, war, and assas-
</p>
<p>sination." St. Bernard speaks of "perjury" as one of the
</p>
<p>leading characteristics of the degenerate ecclesiastics of
</p>
<p>his day. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the
</p>
<p>same state of things is found. Petrarch laments the
</p>
<p>" general destruction in his day of all integrity, justice, hon-
</p>
<p>esty, and fear of God." Mariana says, " The most dreadful
</p>
<p>outrages, perfidy and treason, were better recompensed
</p>
<p>than the brightest virtue. THE WICKEDNESS OF THE PON-
</p>
<p>TIFF DESCENDED TO THE PEOPLE." And what else could
</p>
<p>we expect ? Fordun says, " Inferiors devoted themselves
</p>
<p>to malediction and perjury. Superiors studied to oppress
</p>
<p>their underlings in every possible manner." Antonius, in
</p>
<p>his oration before the council of Trent, says, speaking of
</p>
<p>the state of the community in the sixteenth century,
</p>
<p>" Usury, fraud, &c., enjoyed distinction : worldly and per-
</p>
<p>verse men, encouraged in their wickedness, boasted of
</p>
<p>their villany." Let it be well noted that none of this is
</p>
<p>Protestant testimony. Nothing can be more full and ex-
</p>
<p>plicit than the testimony of Romanist writers on this
</p>
<p>point. I have given but a small specimen from abundant

<p>CHAPTER VII.
</p>
<p>APPEAL FOR JUDGMENT TO ALL TRUE AMERICANS.
</p>
<p>A PART of the evidence which it was ray purpose to
</p>
<p>adduce has been presented. Before I proceed to make
</p>
<p>additional statements, I ask leave to say a few words to
</p>
<p>my Protestant fellow-countrymen throughout this nation.
</p>
<p>In the providence of God, you are placed in circum-
</p>
<p>stances of great interest and responsibility. You are
</p>
<p>called on to judge of the character of the Papal corpora-
</p>
<p>tion, not as a theme of abstract speculation, not as a mere
</p>
<p>historical question, but as a matter of individual and per-
</p>
<p>sonal as well as of general interest. You have sought
</p>
<p>no war with the Papacy ; but the Papacy has declared war
</p>
<p>on you and on your children. This nation, as a Protes-
</p>
<p>tant nation, has commenced an attack upon no religious
</p>
<p>system, but has proclaimed equal rights to all ; but upon
</p>
<p>us, as a Protestant nation, the Papal corporation and their
</p>
<p>agents have commenced an attack.
</p>
<p>They declare that the territory which we occupy be-
</p>
<p>longs to them and to their lord the pope. They declare
</p>
<p>that we Protestants have invaded their territory, but that
</p>
<p>they have never relinquished their claims to it, but intend
</p>
<p>yet to make them good.
</p>
<p>How great their power may be to execute these
</p>
<p>schemes this is not the place to consider. If we may

<p>82 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>trust their own statements, they regard it as adequate and
</p>
<p>their success as sure.
</p>
<p>One thing, at least, is certain the system still wields
</p>
<p>immense power throughout the world ; and as it is or-
</p>
<p>ganized by a permanent central power, sustained by the
</p>
<p>society of the Jesuits and other extensive combinations, it
</p>
<p>has greatly the advantage over unorganized resistance, or
</p>
<p>resistance of men not aware of the depth of its principles
</p>
<p>of perfidy and treachery.
</p>
<p>There is, therefore, no more important point in this
</p>
<p>whole controversy than that which meets you here.
</p>
<p>Charges have been laid before you and evidence adduced ;
</p>
<p>and now you are called on to give judgment. Linked in
</p>
<p>with this evidence is proof of the use made of such prin-
</p>
<p>ciples of treachery in the work of persecution and blood-
</p>
<p>shed.
</p>
<p>From a regard to our national welfare, you are called
</p>
<p>on, then, to judge fairly, but fearlessly and thoroughly, of
</p>
<p>the true character and the fundamental principles of this
</p>
<p>corporation. Nor is this all. The interests of humanity,
</p>
<p>and the dishonor and wrongs of the martyrs of past ages,
</p>
<p>equally demand such a judgment from you ; and to this
</p>
<p>work you are summoned by the providence of God.
</p>
<p>You occupy, therefore, a station of peculiar dignity
</p>
<p>and of immense responsibility. A judgment is demanded
</p>
<p>of you, based upon the highest principles of historical
</p>
<p>truth and justice, and invested with the highest power of
</p>
<p>moral emotion.
</p>
<p>And now I ask, in view of the evidence adduced, Is it
</p>
<p>not manifest that the Romish corporation do avowedly
</p>
<p>place their own interests, as a corporation, above all other
</p>
<p>interests whatever? Do they not declare that all who

</p>
<p>by that act at once disfranchised ot all their rights ? All
</p>
<p>obligations of veracity and fidelity towards them cease.
</p>
<p>Their rights of protection and defence are vacated. They
</p>
<p>are at once outlawed and intestate. Nay, more : to massacre
</p>
<p>and exterminate them is a duty.
</p>
<p>Are not these things so, according to the constitutional
</p>
<p>law of this corporation ? And is it not a dictate of justice,
</p>
<p>as well as of common sense, to judge of such a corporation
</p>
<p>by its constitutional law, and not by the irresponsible state-
</p>
<p>ments of interested apologists ?
</p>
<p>Moreover, have not these principles been imbodied in
</p>
<p>facts on a most stupendous scale for at least seven cen-
</p>
<p>turies ? and have not leagues, and bonds, and covenants
</p>
<p>been broken ? Have not fraud and delusion been employed,
</p>
<p>and has not the blood of millions been shed, under the in-
</p>
<p>fluence of these principles ?
</p>
<p>Is not this corporation, therefore, responsible this day
</p>
<p>before God and before man for these principles and for
</p>
<p>their results ? Do you not judge of any national admin-
</p>
<p>istration, whether whig or democratic, by their avowed
</p>
<p>principles and measures as carried out in fact, and not by
</p>
<p>the plausible statements of interested partisans here and
</p>
<p>there ? Ought you not to judge of this corporation on
</p>
<p>the same principle ? And if you thus judge it, can you
</p>
<p>come to any other conclusion than that it is a conspiracy
</p>
<p>against the interests, and rights, and even the lives of all
</p>
<p>who disown their sway, which no principles of veracity or
</p>
<p>integrity can bind ?
</p>
<p>If the voice of blood could cry from the ground, if the
</p>
<p>slaughtered millions who have been disfranchised by them,
</p>
<p>and who have fallen on the plains of France, Spain, Holland,
</p>
<p>and northern Italy, or have closed their lives in dungeons
</p>
<p>or in the autos dafe of the Inquisition, could call aloud to

<p>in the providence of God, you are now called to sit in
</p>
<p>iudgment. Awake, then, from all delusions, and, at the call
</p>
<p>of divine Providence, exercise righteous judgment for God
</p>
<p>and for humanity. Be not outwitted. Let no plausible
</p>
<p>pretences or smooth evasions turn you aside from a deep
</p>
<p>and thorough scrutiny of the facts of the case."
</p>
<p>Consider, then, in the first place, that there have been
</p>
<p>laid before you, not the mere assertions of single in-
</p>
<p>dividuals like Mr. Brownson and Charles Butler, nor of
</p>
<p>scholastic bodies devoid of authority like the foreign
</p>
<p>universities, nor of individual bishops. There have been
</p>
<p>laid before you solemn and authentic decisions of the
</p>
<p>highest and most authoritative bodies known in the Roman
</p>
<p>world. The constitution of the United States is not more
</p>
<p>a standard of judgment as to the principles of this nation
</p>
<p>than are these decisions as to the principles of the RomisL
</p>
<p>system. Nor can any pope or council hereafter condemn
</p>
<p>and rescind them as false. Such an act would be suicidal.
</p>
<p>It would be a public confession that the pope and a coun-
</p>
<p>cil are fallible. Nay, more : that they have taught the
</p>
<p>doctrines of devils on points of the highest moment. It
</p>
<p>is, therefore, death to the system to condemn and renounce
</p>
<p>tfiese decisions as false.
</p>
<p>2. Consider, also, that these are only a specimen from a
</p>
<p>great storehouse of similar facts. It would be tedious
</p>
<p>to adduce all the evidence that -exists, especially in the
</p>
<p>form of Papal acts, assuming and based on these principles.
</p>
<p>For long centuries they were the established principles and
</p>
<p>practice of the Papal world, in connection with thek indred
</p>
<p>doctrine of the persecution and slaughter of heretics.

<p>They were announced by the greatest of the popes, acqui-

<p>councils, and introduced into the canon law, and carried
</p>
<p>into effect, without remorse and without ecclesiastical
</p>
<p>protest, for long ages.
</p>
<p>3. Consider once more, and this is a point of the deep-
</p>
<p>est and most thrilling interest, that nothing but want of
</p>
<p>power prevented their thorough application to all Euro-
</p>
<p>pean Protestants as they were applied to the Albigenses
</p>
<p>and the Waldenses. Repeated leagues and conspiracies
</p>
<p>of the Romish powers of Europe were formed, and false-
</p>
<p>hood and treachery were unsparingly used, to effect this
</p>
<p>purpose. The massacre of St. Bartholomew was the re-
</p>
<p>sult of such a conspiracy ; and it was effected by the use
</p>
<p>of the most detestable fraud to delude and entrap the too
</p>
<p>confiding Protestants of France.
</p>
<p>A reconciliation was treacherously proposed between
</p>
<p>the Protestants and Romanists. It was to be inaugurated
</p>
<p>and confirmed by the marriage of Henry, the leader of the
</p>
<p>Protestants and King of Navarre, to Margaret, the sister
</p>
<p>of Charles IX., the Popish King of France. Under this
</p>
<p>pretext, multitudes of Protestants, and Coligny, their great
</p>
<p>general, were allured to Paris. Such were the assurances
</p>
<p>of friendship made by Charles, and his mother, Catharine
</p>
<p>de Medici, the infamous author of the plot, that he and all
</p>
<p>the Protestants were thrown entirely off their guard and
</p>
<p>led blindfolded into the toils of Popish malignity and
</p>
<p>treachery. Then followed scenes of horror unprecedented
</p>
<p>in the history of man. At midnight the tocsin tolled ; and
</p>
<p>at the signal the work of slaughter began. The streets
</p>
<p>of Paris were deluged with blood. From Paris, as from
</p>
<p>a centre, the massacre spread through France. Upon such
</p>
<p>a scene of infernal treachery and bloodshed the angels
</p>
<p>of God never looked down before. A thrill of horror
</p>
<p>pervaded the Protestant world.

<p>From the same principles and conspiracy came the mas-

<p>86 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>sacres perpetrated by the Duke of Alva in the Nether-
</p>
<p>lands. Hence came the Inquisition hence the Spanish

</p>
<p>England and the Houses of Lords and Commons by one
</p>
<p>tremendous explosion of gunpowder, ever since known as
</p>
<p>the infamous Gunpowder Plot.
</p>
<p>4. Consider still more attentively the great fact, that all
</p>
<p>such acts of treachery, fraud, and violence, outraging alike
</p>
<p>truth and justice, God and man, were regarded by the
</p>
<p>Pope and court of Rome as the discharge of an exalted
</p>
<p>Christian duty. The treachery and massacre of St. Bar-
</p>
<p>tholomew, in particular, were commemorated, among other
</p>
<p>religious services, by a Te Deum, as well as by the casting
</p>
<p>of two medals, with inscriptions commemorative of the
</p>
<p>defj$f. On one side of one of the medals was the inscrip-
</p>
<p>tion, Virtus in rebelles " Valor against rebels." On the
</p>
<p>other, Pietas excitavit justitiam '"Piety aroused justice."
</p>
<p>On another coin issued by Pope Gregory is seen an
</p>
<p>angel, armed with a sword and a cross, attacking the her-
</p>
<p>etics. Thus the pope gave the sanction of God and his
</p>
<p>angels to this infamous deed of treachery and blood.
</p>
<p>5. Consider once more, that in view of all the preced-
</p>
<p>ing facts, even according to their own doctrines, the Rom-
</p>
<p>ish corporation and all who choose to remain Romanists
</p>
<p>are irretrievably committed to the avowal and defence of
</p>
<p>these principles and their practical results. There is no
</p>
<p>one point which they urge on us so incessantly as the in-
</p>
<p>dispensable necessity of this infallible corporation to set-
</p>
<p>tle the canon of the Bible and the rest of the rule of faith,
</p>
<p>and then to interpret them and promulgate infallibly the
</p>
<p>true doctrines of the church. This is, as I have shown,
</p>
<p>the central point, the very life, of the system. And now,
</p>
<p>will they turn around and repudiate the decisions of this

<p>mit in order to escape endless perdition ? Will they con-
</p>
<p>cede the fallibility of their church in a case the most mo-
</p>
<p>mentous that the mind of man can conceive ? A sacred
</p>
<p>regard to truth is the great bond of human society. But
</p>
<p>not only to violate truth, but to do it as a means of mur-
</p>
<p>der, and that on a scale of terrific magnitude, is the estab-
</p>
<p>lished doctrine and practice of the Romish corporation.
</p>
<p>If, in a case so momentous as this, they have deluged the
</p>
<p>nations with blood by their false and damnable doctrines,
</p>
<p>then what shadow of confidence do they deserve in any
</p>
<p>other case ?
</p>
<p>The only logical course by which any Romanist can
</p>
<p>avoid a rejection of this corporation is to advocate and
</p>
<p>defend the principles themselves.
</p>
<p>Yet such principles are in thfs age so odious and ob-
</p>
<p>noxious, especially in Great Britain and in this country,
</p>
<p>that every effort has been made to escape from this po-
</p>
<p>sition.

<p>To these efforts I shall next call your attention.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII.
</p>
<p>THE GALLICAN, OR FRENCH, DOCTRINE.
</p>
<p>To understand this, it is necessary to consider a few
</p>
<p>historical facts. In consequence of the extreme despotism
</p>
<p>and corruption of the Pope and court of Rome, an effort
</p>
<p>was made a little before the reformation to limit his power
</p>
<p>and to reform his court. At the council of Constance,
</p>
<p>by a solemn decree, a general council was declared su-
</p>
<p>perior to the pope, and authorized to reform him and his
</p>
<p>court. Even the Romish world were driven to this course
</p>
<p>by the extremity of his despotism. But, after the coun-
</p>
<p>cil rose, the centralizing power of the pope, operating
</p>
<p>steadily, baffled their efforts ; and the Papal court has ever
</p>
<p>since repudiated their decree.
</p>
<p>After the reformation, Louis XIV., of France, the most
</p>
<p>powerful monarch of the age, determined to make another
</p>
<p>effort to limit the power of the pope. He therefore aimed
</p>
<p>a blow at the doctrine of the pope's supremacy over kings.
</p>
<p>Up to this time, that supremacy, and the consequent right
</p>
<p>of deposing them and of absolving their subjects from
</p>
<p>their oaths, had been the firmly-established doctrine of the
</p>
<p>Romish system. But, under the influence of Louis, the
</p>
<p>Romish clergy of France, in 1682, made a declaration, in
</p>
<p>which, among other things, they declared that " kings and
</p>
<p>sovereigns are not subjected to any ecclesiastical power
</p>
<p>by the order of God in temporal things ; and their sub-

</p>
<p>jects cannot be released from the obedience which they
</p>
<p>owe them, nor absolved from their oath of allegiance."
</p>
<p>The Pope and the court of Borne were, of course, indig-
</p>
<p>nant in the extreme. By a multitude of writers they viru-
</p>
<p>lently assailed the declaration, and threatened anathemas
</p>
<p>and excommunications.
</p>
<p>But Louis rallied his forces for the defence of his clergy.
</p>
<p>By an edict, he forbade all persons, secular and regular,
</p>
<p>subjects or strangers, throughout his dominions, to teach
</p>
<p>or write any thing contrary to this declaration, and com-
</p>
<p>manded his whole clergy to inculcate and defend the doc-
</p>
<p>trine therein contained.
</p>
<p>No doubt Louis would have been deposed and his bish-
</p>
<p>ops excommunicated by the pope had he not feared to see
</p>
<p>France in revolt from him, after the example of England.
</p>
<p>He feared to see Louis XIV. walking in the steps of Hen-
</p>
<p>ry VIII. He therefore endured what he could not pre-
</p>
<p>vent. Yet, for some time, he refused to send bulls of in-
</p>
<p>stitution to French bishops newly elected until they wrote
</p>
<p>to him, each for himself, protesting that the clergy of
</p>
<p>France did not intend to make a decree of faith by their
</p>
<p>declaration, and assuring him of their profound submis-
</p>
<p>sion to the rights of the holy chair.
</p>
<p>The doctrine of this declaration is called, indifferently,
</p>
<p>the Gallican, or the French, or the Cisalpine, doctrine.
</p>
<p>That of the court of Rome is called the Italian, or Trans-
</p>
<p>alpine, doctrine. It is, in fact, the doctrine of the popes
</p>
<p>of the middle ages. Of the Gallican doctrine, the chief
</p>
<p>defender was the celebrated Bossuet.
</p>
<p>The French Catholic historians, Dupin and Fleury,
</p>
<p>stood upon this ground. Hence, in their histories, they
</p>
<p>are free to expose and condemn to a certain extent the
</p>
<p>arrogant encroachments of the pope on the church as well

<p>as on the state. Hence, from their writings, Protestants
</p>
<p>90 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>derive valuable aid in their warfare with the court of
</p>
<p>Rome. But, for the same reason, they are odious to the
</p>
<p>thorough defenders of the Papal power.
</p>
<p>All the universities consulted by Pitt also belonged to
</p>
<p>the same school, and were consulted for this reason.
</p>
<p>Besides the divines and laymen of the Gallican school,
</p>
<p>there are other Romanists in France and elsewhere who
</p>
<p>repudiate the doctrine of the pope's temporal supremacy in
</p>
<p>Italy in the States of the Church. They consider this as the
</p>
<p>result of a scheme of worldly ambition, and pernicious in its
</p>
<p>tendencies and results to the spiritual character of the Pa-
</p>
<p>pacy and to all the interests of civil society. Of this class
</p>
<p>is M. Daunou, a learned French civilian, who has written
</p>
<p>an able history of the court of Rome, designed to expose
</p>
<p>the frauds and forgeries through which this temporal
</p>
<p>power was first gained and its destructive influence on the
</p>
<p>interests of Europe. From such writers, also, who still re-
</p>
<p>gard the pope as properly the spiritual head of the church,
</p>
<p>much aid can be derived in our warfare with the Papacy.
</p>
<p>But of course such writers are more hated by the court
</p>
<p>of Rome than even the writers of the Gallican school.
</p>
<p>We are now prepared to understand the course of
</p>
<p>events in England and America and the present position
</p>
<p>of the defenders of the Papal corporation.
</p>
<p>The genuine doctrines of that corporation are so re-
</p>
<p>pugnant to the convictions of England and America, and
</p>
<p>so odious to every friend of humanity, that in some way it
</p>
<p>is necessary to blind and delude the too confiding Protes-
</p>
<p>tants, so as to put them off their guard until the system
</p>
<p>has gained foothold and power.
</p>
<p>To effect this, two courses have been adopted. The
</p>
<p>first was tried in England by Charles Butler and others ;
</p>
<p>the second in this country, by Bishops Kenrick and

</p>
<p>the two great evasions to which reference has been made.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER IX.
</p>
<p>EVASION OF CHARLES BUTLER.
</p>
<p>IN the light of the present age, and before the bar of
</p>
<p>the omniscient Judge of nations, the Romish corporation
</p>
<p>has been long summoned to give an account for those
</p>
<p>principles and deeds which have been set forth. But, as a
</p>
<p>corporation, it has, thus far, made no reply. It is not
</p>
<p>willing openly to avow and justify its past deeds of treach-
</p>
<p>ery and blood ; and it cannot, or will not, confess fallibility
</p>
<p>and damning guilt.
</p>
<p>Its partisans, therefore, have come forward from time to
</p>
<p>time to speak in its behalf. In England, Charles Butler
</p>
<p>has taken the lead ; in America, Bishops Kenrick, Hughes,
</p>
<p>and Purcell, and Mr. Brownson.
</p>
<p>The first mode of defence resorted to is that of Charles
</p>
<p>Butler. He follows Bossuet, and the Gallican, or French,
</p>
<p>school of divines. He abandons to just mnra^ation such
</p>
<p>decisions and deeds of the Popes of-R<3*ne As have been
</p>
<p>stated, but endeavors to prove that the doctrines in ques-
</p>
<p>tion are not taught by any general council, but solely by
</p>
<p>the popes, and that the doctrines and conduct of the
</p>
<p>popes in such cases were not the voice of the church.
</p>
<p>This defence is obviously at war, not only with that
</p>
<p>most unequivocal documentary evidence which I have pro-
</p>
<p>duced, but also with much not yet presented.
</p>
<p>The doctrines in question were as truly promulgated and

<p>EVASION OF CHARLES BUTLER. 93
</p>
<p>sustained by general councils as by popes. This has been
</p>
<p>proved as to some councils, and is true of others. Six gen-
</p>
<p>eral councils, in principle or in practice, or in both, sanc-
</p>
<p>tioned the violation of engagements and breach of trust for
</p>
<p>the sake of ecclesiastical utility. This view cannot be
</p>
<p>carried out except by misrepresenting, evading, or denying
</p>
<p>the plainest facts of history. Yet Charles Butler adopted
</p>
<p>this course and used such fraud and evasion, because to
</p>
<p>conduct the Eomish cause to a safe issue on any other
</p>
<p>ground seemed hopeless at the time. It seems to have
</p>
<p>been with him a stroke of policy.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brownson, however, coincides with me in thinking
</p>
<p>it poor policy to defend the Papacy by denying or ignoring
</p>
<p>any obvious and notorious matters of fact.
</p>
<p>The course of Butler and of all others who adopt the
</p>
<p>principles of the Gallican party he repudiates as at war
</p>
<p>with facts, dishonorable to the great popes of the middle
</p>
<p>ages, and ruinous to Romanism in its ultimate tendencies
</p>
<p>and results. It was only adopted, he tells us, because the
</p>
<p>Romanists were then weak and cowed down, and is utterly
</p>
<p>unfit for these times of higher courage and bolder enterprise.
</p>
<p>As to the acts of popes in deposing sovereigns and dis-
</p>
<p>solving oaths of allegiance, which Butler repudiates as no
</p>
<p>part of the system of Romanism, he says,
</p>
<p>" The answers which the church gives to all great prac-
</p>
<p>tical questions have become historical. These answers
</p>
<p>are in many instances, no doubt, very offensive to the
</p>
<p>spirit of the present age, and such as the prevailing public
</p>
<p>opinion denounces ; but there they stand on the page of
</p>
<p>history, and can be neither honestly nor successfully de-
</p>
<p>nied or explained away. What the church has done, what
</p>
<p>she has expressly or tacitly approved in the past, that
</p>
<p>is exactly what she will do, expressly or tacitly approve,

</p>
<p>in the future, if the same circumstances occur. This may
</p>
<p>94 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>be a difficulty, an embarrassment ; but it will not do to shrink
</p>
<p>from it. We are responsible for the past history of the
</p>
<p>church in so far as she herself has acted ; and to attempt to
</p>
<p>apologize for it by an appeal to the opinion of the times,
</p>
<p>or to explain it in conformity with the prevailing spirit
</p>
<p>and theories of non-Catholics in our age, is only to
</p>
<p>weaken the reverence of the faithful for the church and
</p>
<p>yield the victory to her enemies."
</p>
<p>"We agree with Mr. Brownson in regarding the course
</p>
<p>of Butler and the Gallicans as fatal to the church.
</p>
<p>For, suppose that it were true which it is not that
</p>
<p>no general councils had sanctioned such decisions and
</p>
<p>deeds of the great popes of the middle ages ; suppose, too,
</p>
<p>that the popes are not infallible without a general council ;
</p>
<p>suppose what is not true that a decision ex cathedra,
</p>
<p>acquiesced in by the bishops, is not deemed infallible.
</p>
<p>We ask, Why did not th'e church in some form rebuke the
</p>
<p>popes, and set them right, if they were teaching the doc-
</p>
<p>trines of devils and reducing them to practice ? If there
</p>
<p>was infallibility any where in the Romish corporation dur-
</p>
<p>ing those long and bloody centuries, why did it not in
</p>
<p>some way show itself? Did not the Romish corporation
</p>
<p>then know that those principles and deeds of the popes
</p>
<p>were wrong which Charles Butler and the Gallicans now
</p>
<p>so loudly condemn ? If they did, then why did they not
</p>
<p>condemn them ? If they did not, then what a mockery is
</p>
<p>it to call that an infallible corporation which could not,
</p>
<p>and did not, defend either themselves or their head for
</p>
<p>long centuries from errors so gigantic, promulgated to the
</p>
<p>nations as the truths of God Almighty, the rejection of
</p>
<p>which would surely encounter his wrath, or from their in-
</p>
<p>evitable results in deeds of treachery and blood that have
</p>
<p>ever since caused a thrill of horror among the nations!

<p>CHAPTER X.
</p>
<p>EVASION OF BISHOPS HUGHES AND E.ENR.ICK.
</p>
<p>THE other mode of evading the facts, as to the deposing
</p>
<p>power of the pope and the invalidation of oaths, is to
</p>
<p>resolve the whole matter into the peculiar state of society
</p>
<p>in the middle ages, in which it was the will of the rulers
</p>
<p>and of the people that the pope should exercise such
</p>
<p>power.
</p>
<p>On this ground Bishop Hughes, in 1843, defended the
</p>
<p>Papal corporation, in his lecture before the Irish Emigra-
</p>
<p>tion Society in New York. Speaking of the Papal cor-
</p>
<p>poration, he says, p. 12, " If she has, at times, interfered
</p>
<p>with the civil prerogatives of temporal sovereigns, her
</p>
<p>right to do so is not founded on her divine charter, but
</p>
<p>resulted either from the concession of the states themselves,
</p>
<p>or from the absolute exigency of the circumstances."
</p>
<p>At still greater length has Bishop Kenrick defended
</p>
<p>this view, in his labored Vindication of the Primacy of the
</p>
<p>Pope of Rome. He says, " By the will of princes and of
</p>
<p>nations, and at their earnest solicitation, he intervened in
</p>
<p>former ages, and, exercising a pacific protectorate, main-
</p>
<p>tained the rights of all. * * * g u t he no longer em-
</p>
<p>ploys a power which the will and the wants of the nations
</p>
<p>once placed in his hands, but which they have again in
</p>
<p>their caprice wrested from him." Pp. 304, 305.

</p>
<p>Both of these bishops also assure us that from this state
</p>
<p>of things. vast benefits flowed to the world.
</p>
<p>Concerning this stupendous evasion, I remark, in the
</p>
<p>first place, that it is directly at war with facts.
</p>
<p>The Papal deposing power and dissolution of oaths
</p>
<p>was not a " pacific protectorate," established by the na-
</p>
<p>tions, but a constant stimulus to revolt and civil war.
</p>
<p>Against all sovereigns who did not blindly obey the pope
</p>
<p>it gave him full power to fan the flames of discontent
</p>
<p>and to arouse his subjects to rebellion. It was even used to
</p>
<p>stir up the children of kings to the vilest treachery towards
</p>
<p>their parents. Such was the course taken by the popes
</p>
<p>towards the children of the hated and anathematized
</p>
<p>Henry IV.
</p>
<p>On this point it is well to place in pointed contrast the
</p>
<p>words of Bishop Kenrick and those of the celebrated pri-
</p>
<p>mate Bossuet. It is an illustrious specimen of t"he "va-
</p>
<p>riations " of Romanism.
</p>
<p>In his Defence of the Declaration of the Gallican Clergy,
</p>
<p>book iv. chap, xvii., Bossuet says,
</p>
<p>" Whenever kings have been deposed by the Roman pon-
</p>
<p>tiffs in the exercise of such authority, NEVER by any king,
</p>
<p>NEVER by the different orders of any kingdom, has this author-
</p>
<p>ity been recognized as lawful. On the other hand, kingdoms
</p>
<p>and kings have resisted it, and the result has been bloody
</p>
<p>foreign and civil wars ; wherefore the pope has not, in fact,
</p>
<p>ever bestowed kingdoms, but has only produced causes of
</p>
<p>war, and given a pretext and color to ambition and rebel-
</p>
<p>lion, and involved the whole world in the flames of war ;
</p>
<p>and, in a word, these depositions of kings by the authority of
</p>
<p>the pope have never been of the least use, but have caused
</p>
<p>immense odium and injury." .
</p>
<p>In the second place, both of these writers, and Bishop

</p>
<p>Kenrick in particular, have inexcusably misrepresented
</p>
<p>98 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>the real nature of the Papal claim as put forth by Gregory
</p>
<p>VII., the great founder of the system, and by his successors.
</p>
<p>"Vftth true Jesuitical craft, Bishop Kenrick has avoided
</p>
<p>all quotations from the letters of Gregory to the sovereigns
</p>
<p>and ecclesiastics of Europe, in which he unequivocally
</p>
<p>developed his purpose to reduce all temporal rulers to the
</p>
<p>position of feudal vassals to the holy see, binding them by
</p>
<p>an oath of allegiance similar to that by which the bishops
</p>
<p>were soon bound, and which they take even to this day.
</p>
<p>He does not quote his reputed claims of a divine right to
</p>
<p>do all this. On the other hand, against both the letter
</p>
<p>and the spirit of the act of deposition, he represents
</p>
<p>Gregory as acting by an authority conferred on him by
</p>
<p>the nations. In a series of twelve letters to the bishop,
</p>
<p>published in the Christian Alliance some years since, I
</p>
<p>at some length exposed what I could not but consider as
</p>
<p>his deliberate Jesuitical frauds, designed to Ifoodwink and
</p>
<p>delude my honorable and magnanimous fellow-citizens.
</p>
<p>I have not room at present to go farther into the details
</p>
<p>of the case.
</p>
<p>It is enough to say, in general, that nothing can be more
</p>
<p>at war with notorious facts than this evasion. Where or
</p>
<p>when did Gregory VII., or Innocent III., or Boniface
</p>
<p>VIII., or any other of those imperious lords of the church
</p>
<p>declare or even hint that they derived their powers from
</p>
<p>either rulers or the people, or that they were acting in
</p>
<p>their name ? They claimed their powers directly from
</p>
<p>God, through Peter, the great head of the church. Nor
</p>
<p>did the nations ever pretend that it belonged to them to
</p>
<p>confer such power on the pope. The very idea is ridicu-
</p>
<p>lous to any one who knows the spirit and the convictions
</p>
<p>of that age.
</p>
<p>It deserves notice, also, that these claims of the pope, as

<p>head of the church, do not rest on his own unsustained
</p>
<p>EVASION OF BISHOPS HUGHES AND KENRICK. 99
</p>
<p>assumptions. In the great general council of Lyons, in
</p>
<p>1245, Pope Innocent IY. and the council together con-
</p>
<p>firmed the doctrine of the divine right of the pope and
</p>
<p>of the Papal corporation to depose monarchs. The pope
</p>
<p>deposed Frederic II. ; and they concurred with the pope,
</p>
<p>proclaiming their decision as the judgment of God and
</p>
<p>their own, but not referring, even remotely, to a delegated
</p>
<p>power received from the people. The same principles
</p>
<p>were established in the fourth Lateran council under
</p>
<p>Innocent III. and by many other general councils.
</p>
<p>Moreover, in the long run, this evasion is no less fatal
</p>
<p>to the Papal system than the other. According to it, on
</p>
<p>questions of the highest conceivable moment, the pope
</p>
<p>leaves his lofty position, as filling the place of God on
</p>
<p>earth, to become a mere fallible tribune, or president, or
</p>
<p>referee of human appointment among contending nations.
</p>
<p>He is a mere fallible agent of human, uninspired society,
</p>
<p>and not Us lord and head. It in fact betrays the cause
</p>
<p>of the Papacy and the Romish church, through fear of the
</p>
<p>enlightened, popular sentiments of the present age.
</p>
<p>Mr. Browrison sees the logical results of this evasion also,
</p>
<p>and boldly repudiates it. He also declares it to be at war
</p>
<p>with facts. Civil governments and human society, he er-
</p>
<p>roneously affirms, did acknowledge the supremacy of the
</p>
<p>pope over earthly rulers and his power to dissolve oaths ;
</p>
<p>but he insists that they did not confer it. Nor did the
</p>
<p>pope ever concede or intimate that such was the basis of
</p>
<p>his power. Nothing can be stronger than the assertions of
</p>
<p>Mr. Brownson in his review of M. Gosselin. He says,
</p>
<p>" The whole current of history is against the author.
</p>
<p>He cannot adduce a single official act of pope or council
</p>
<p>which concedes that the temporal authority exercised was
</p>
<p>held only by a human title. All history fails to show an

</p>
<p>instance in which the pope, in deposing a temporal sover-
</p>
<p>100 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>eign, professes to do it by the authority vested in him
</p>
<p>by the pious belief of the faithful, generally received max-
</p>
<p>ims, the opinion of the age, the concessions of sovereigns,
</p>
<p>or the civil constitution and public laws of Catholic states.
</p>
<p>On the contrary, he always claims to do it by the authori-
</p>
<p>ty committed to him as the successor of the prince of
</p>
<p>the apostles, by the authority of his apostolic ministry, by
</p>
<p>the authority committed to him of binding and loosing, by
</p>
<p>the authority of Almighty God, of Jesus Christ, King of
</p>
<p>kings and Lord of lords, whose minister, though unworthy,
</p>
<p>he asserts that he is ; or some such formula, which solemnly
</p>
<p>and expressly sets forth that his authority is held by
</p>
<p>divine right, by virtue of his ministry, and exercised sole-
</p>
<p>ly in his character of vicar of Jesus Christ on earth. To
</p>
<p>this, we believe, there is not a single exception. Wher-
</p>
<p>ever the popes cite their titles, they never, so far as we can
</p>
<p>find, cite a human title, but always a divine title. Whence
</p>
<p>is this ? Did the popes cite a false title ? Were they ig-
</p>
<p>norant of their own title ? or was this assertion of title
</p>
<p>an empty form, meaning nothing ? This is a grave matter ;
</p>
<p>and this fact alone seems to us decisive against the author."
</p>
<p>He also says,
</p>
<p>" One of two things, it seems to us, must be admitted,
</p>
<p>if we have regard to the undeniable facts in the case ;
</p>
<p>namely, either the popes usurped the authority tJiey exercised
</p>
<p>over sovereigns in the middle ages, or they possessed it by
</p>
<p>virtue of their title as vicars of Jesus Christ on earth. We
</p>
<p>do not, therefore, regard M. Gosselin's theory as tenable ;
</p>
<p>and we count his attempted defence of the pope on the
</p>
<p>ground of human right a failure.
</p>
<p>" There is, in our judgment, but one valid defence of the
</p>
<p>popes in their exercise of temporal authority in the mid-
</p>
<p>dle ages over sovereigns ; and that is, that they possess it

</p>
<p>by divine right, or that the pope holds that authority by
</p>
<p>virtue of his commission from Jesus Christ, as the succes-
</p>
<p>sor of Peter, the prince of the apostles, and visible head
</p>
<p>of the church. Any defence of them on a lower ground
</p>
<p>must, in our judgment, fail to meet the real points in the
</p>
<p>case, and is rather an evasion than a fair, honest, direct,
</p>
<p>EVASION OF BISHOPS HUGHES AND KENRICK. 101
</p>
<p>and satisfactory reply. To defend their power as an ex-
</p>
<p>traordinary power, or as an accident in church history,
</p>
<p>growing out of the peculiar circumstances, civil constitu-
</p>
<p>tion, and laws of the times, no\y passed away, perhaps for-
</p>
<p>ever, may be regarded as less likely to displease non-
</p>
<p>Catholics and to offend the sensibilities of power than to
</p>
<p>defend it on the ground of divine right and as inherent in
</p>
<p>the divine constitution of the church ; but, even on the low
</p>
<p>ground of policy, we do not think it the wisest in the long
</p>
<p>run. Say what we will, we can gain little credit with
</p>
<p>those we would conciliate. Always, to their minds, will
</p>
<p>the temporal power of the pope by divine right loom up
</p>
<p>in the distance ; and always will they believe, however
</p>
<p>individual Catholics here and thero may deny it or nom-
</p>
<p>inally Catholic governments oppose it, that it is the real
</p>
<p>Roman Catholic doctrine, to be reasserted and acted the
</p>
<p>moment that circumstances render it prudent or expe-
</p>
<p>dient. We gain nothing with them but doubts of our sin-
</p>
<p>cerity, and we only weaken among ourselves that warm
</p>
<p>and generous devotion to the holy father which is due
</p>
<p>from every one of the faithful, and which is so essential
</p>
<p>to the prosperity of the church in her unceasing struggles
</p>
<p>with the godless powers of this world."
</p>
<p>He also asserts that the position thus defended by him
</p>
<p>is that of the leading Romish divines :
</p>
<p>" He cannot be unaware that the doctrine he rejects is
</p>
<p>the most logical, the most consonant to Catholic instincts,
</p>
<p>the most honorable to the dignity and majesty of the Pa-
</p>
<p>pacy, or that it has undeniably the weight of authority on
</p>
<p>its side. The principal Catholic authorities are certainly
</p>
<p>in favor of the divine right ; and the principal authorities
</p>
<p>which he is able to oppose to them are of parliaments,
</p>
<p>sovereigns, jurisconsults, courtiers, and prelates and doc-

<p>tors who sustained the temporal powers in their wars
</p>
<p>against the popes. The Gallican doctrine was, from the
</p>
<p>first, the doctrine of the courts, in opposition to that of
</p>
<p>the vicars of Jesus Christ, and should, therefore, be re-
</p>
<p>garded by every Catholic with suspicion."
</p>
<p>9*
</p>
<p>102 THE PAPAL CONSPIKACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>It is interesting to notice that nevertheless, in view of
</p>
<p>the popular feeling in this country, Bishops Hughes and
</p>
<p>Kenrick have both undertaken to defend the course of the
</p>
<p>popes during the middle ages on the very grounds which
</p>
<p>Mr. Brownson so pointedly condemns.
</p>
<p>Their defence, however, deserves no confidence as an
</p>
<p>expression of their real opinions. It was, no doubt, de-
</p>
<p>signed to delude Protestants for the time, till the Romish
</p>
<p>corporation might gain strength to assume a new po-
</p>
<p>sition.
</p>
<p>I am led to this conclusion by the fact that the Romish
</p>
<p>agents, both in France and in this country, seem to be at
</p>
<p>length disclosing their purpose to assume the ground
</p>
<p>which I- have stated as the real Papal ground, and which
</p>
<p>is the only consistent and logical basis on which to at-
</p>
<p>tempt a defence of the Papacy. The old Gallican doc-
</p>
<p>trine is also generally abandoned in France ; and we are
</p>
<p>coming to the simple position, that all who revolt from
</p>
<p>the Romish corporation, by that very act are disfranchised
</p>
<p>and stripped of all their rights.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brownson, in his Review for January, 1852, makes
</p>
<p>the bold and explicit avowal that Protestantism of every
</p>
<p>form has,, not, and never can have, any rights. P. 64.
</p>
<p>^ He says also that "we lose all the breath we expend
</p>
<p>in declaiming against bigotry and intolerance, and in
</p>
<p>favor of religious liberty, or the right of any man to be
</p>
<p>of religion or no religion, as best pleases him, which some
</p>
<p>two or three of our journalists would fain persuade the
</p>
<p>world is Catholic doctrine."
</p>
<p>It seems, then, that when Mr. Brownson, in a former
</p>
<p>extract, speaks of conceding to us equal rights, he means,
</p>
<p>as we intimated, so long as they have no power to take
</p>
<p>them away. But as soon as Catholicity is triumphant,

<p>then beware.
</p>
<p>EVASION OP BISHOPS HUGHES AND KENRICK. 103
</p>
<p>I find in the Letters of an Independent Irishman, ad-
</p>
<p>dressed to Bishop Fitzpatrick, the following passage :
</p>
<p>"Says Bishop Kenrick, 'No faith with heretics;' and
</p>
<p>says Bishop O'Connor, of Pittsburg, 'Religious liberty is
</p>
<p>merely endured until the opposite can be carried into execution
</p>
<p>without peril to the Catholic world.' This bigoted sentiment
</p>
<p>is the same in kind with that quoted from the Catholic
</p>
<p>Review no rights for Protestants, or any body else ex-
</p>
<p>cept Catholics. Fine doctrine for a republic ! Of pre-
</p>
<p>cisely the same nature was the sentiment lately uttered
</p>
<p>by the Bishop of St. Louis : ' Catholicity will one day
</p>
<p>rule America ; and then religious liberty is at an end.' No
</p>
<p>doubt of it. The St. Louis bishop and I agree exactly
</p>
<p>on this point ; and such, I presume, is your opinion also."
</p>
<p>I have not verified these quotations ; but, whether they
</p>
<p>have used these precise words or not, I have no doubt
</p>
<p>that they express the real sentiments of those men.
</p>
<p>Whatever any American bishop may say, one act of
</p>
<p>theirs speaks louder than all their professions of patriot-
</p>
<p>ism ; yea, louder than seven thunders. They have, by a
</p>
<p>solemn decision of their provincial council at Baltimore,
</p>
<p>significantly proclaimed that they adopt the system of
</p>
<p>which the maxims are such as have been set forth.
</p>
<p>Into the midst of this Protestant nation, by a special
</p>
<p>act of the Baltimore council of Rornish bishops, they have
</p>
<p>introduced the idolatrous worship of Gregory VII. ; thu?
</p>
<p>selecting and presenting him, of all the saints of the
</p>
<p>Romish calendar, to our own people as an object of wor-
</p>
<p>ship, and fixing the eyes of this nation on him as the
</p>
<p>object of peculiar attention and reverence.
</p>
<p>We accordingly look at his character, and find him to
</p>
<p>be the notorious author of the system of deposing kings,
</p>
<p>and the projector of a universal feudal monarchy, of which

</p>
<p>he was to be the head, and all kings, nobles, and rulers
</p>
<p>his sworn vassals. We find him, in endeavoring to carry
</p>
<p>104 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>out his claims and plans, involving Italy and Germany for
</p>
<p>more than thirty years in a bloody civil war, and estab-
</p>
<p>lishing precedents which for centuries disturbed the peace
</p>
<p>of all Europe and subjected the nations to the most ap-
</p>
<p>palling despotism ever known. Pius Y. canonized him as
</p>
<p>a saint.
</p>
<p>The service prescribed by him for the festival of Greg-
</p>
<p>ory, in the Roman breviary, specially commemorates his
</p>
<p>acts in the following terms : " Gregory shone like the
</p>
<p>sun in the house of God. He deprived Henry of his king-
</p>
<p>dom and freed his vassals from their fealty. All the
</p>
<p>earth is full of his doctrine. He has departed to heaven.
</p>
<p>Enable us, by his example and advocacy, to overcome all
</p>
<p>adversity. May he intercede for all the sins of the peo-
</p>
<p>ple." Alexander VII. introduced this office into the Ro-
</p>
<p>man basilics. Clement XI., in 1704, recommended it to
</p>
<p>the Cistercians, and, in 1710, to the Benedictines. It
</p>
<p>was approved by Benedict XIII., and retains its place in
</p>
<p>the Roman breviary.
</p>
<p>Let it now be noticed still further, that this act of can-
</p>
<p>onization had special reference to the deposing doctrine.
</p>
<p>It indorses it, as practised by Gregory, in the most ample
</p>
<p>manner. It regards it as the doctrine of all times and
</p>
<p>all countries, and declares that the earth is full of that
</p>
<p>doctrine.
</p>
<p>Nor is this all. The maxims of Gregory VII. have not
</p>
<p>been renounced by the court of Rome in the nineteenth
</p>
<p>century. I refer you to the following statement of Dau-
</p>
<p>nou, that eminently learned and candid Roman Catholic :
</p>
<p>"If we had lost the twenty-seven propositions of Hilde-
</p>
<p>brand, they might all be found in the acts of Pius VII.,
</p>
<p>A. ]). 1800-1823. This will not astonish those who have
</p>
<p>studied the history of the court of Rome. While it exists,

</p>
<p>this court will have no other principles. Scarcely will it
</p>
<p>EVASION OP BISHOPS HUGHES AXD KENRICK. 105
</p>
<p>be able to dissemble them, even in times which require the
</p>
<p>most circumspection. We shall, without doubt, see this
</p>
<p>court taking advantage of all circumstances, which will
</p>
<p>allow her still to maintain them, by anathemas, by wars,
</p>
<p>by catastrophes, and by vast proscriptions."
</p>
<p>If this seems to be bold language for a Roman Catholic,
</p>
<p>let it be compared with the language of Bossuet, whose
</p>
<p>words I have already quoted. It is but a faithful carrying
</p>
<p>out of the spirit of his statements.
</p>
<p>Let me then disclose, for the benefit of American repub-
</p>
<p>licans, some of this doctrine of Gregory, of which the
</p>
<p>earth is declared to be full. Baronius regards the twenty-
</p>
<p>seven propositions as a genuine composition of Gregory
</p>
<p>himself ; others regard them as a collection of sentiments
</p>
<p>derived from his letters ; but all agree that they truly rep-
</p>
<p>resent the doctrine of his epistles and of his acts. Indeed
</p>
<p>they can all be derived from his letters.
</p>
<p>" He alone can invest himself with the insignia of em-
</p>
<p>pire."
</p>
<p>" He has authority to depose emperors."
</p>
<p>" He can absolve the subjects of bad princes from every
</p>
<p>oath of fe'alty."
</p>
<p>" All princes kiss his feet alone."
</p>
<p>" His name only is to be pronounced in the churches."
</p>
<p>"It is the only name in the world."
</p>
<p>Such is the doctrine of Gregory VII., of which, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to the services of the Papal church, the world is full.
</p>
<p>But in all this it seems that the bishops of that church
</p>
<p>in the United States of America see no ambition and no
</p>
<p>usurpation. No ; for Bishop Kenrick tells us that Pope
</p>
<p>Gregory VII. " is recognized as a saint, and cannot, without
</p>
<p>temerity, be accused of ambition." Moreover, that very
</p>
<p>church which recognizes him as a saint celebrates his
</p>
<p>deposing doctrine and deeds in acts of solemn worship

<p>106 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>Moreover, Bishop Kenrick really, though not openly,
</p>
<p>declares that the true and proper state of society was that
</p>
<p>which existed whilst these doctrines were in force, and
</p>
<p>that the world has been a loser by rejecting them. All
</p>
<p>this was fully evinced in the letters to which reference has
</p>
<p>been made.
</p>
<p>With such facts before us, is there any reason to doubt
</p>
<p>that the Romish bishops of America would, if they could,
</p>
<p>carry out the extremest views of the Italian school, of
</p>
<p>which Gregory VII. is the founder and head ?
</p>
<p>It is also a sign of the times that the same views are
</p>
<p>reproduced in England, France, and America. The
</p>
<p>French school is dying out ; and all-pervading efforts are
</p>
<p>made to establish the most absolute doctrines of the court
</p>
<p>of Rome, which have already deluged the world in blood.
</p>
<p>In England, a Romish paper called the Rambler speaks
</p>
<p>as follows :
</p>
<p>" Religious liberty, in the sense of a liberty possessed
</p>
<p>by every man to choose his own religion, is one of the
</p>
<p>most wicked delusions ever foisted upon this age by the
</p>
<p>father of all deceit. The very name of liberty except in
</p>
<p>the sense of a permission to do certain definite acts
</p>
<p>ought to be banished from the domain of religion. It is neither
</p>
<p>more nor less than a falsehood. JVb man has a right to choose
</p>
<p>his religion. None but an atheist can uphold the principles
</p>
<p>of religious liberty. Shall I, therefore, fall in with this
</p>
<p>abominable delusion? Shall I foster that damnable doctrine,
</p>
<p>that Socinianism, and Calvinism, and Anglicanism, and Ju-
</p>
<p>daism are not every one of them mortal sins like murder and
</p>
<p>adultery ? Shall I hold out hopes to my erring Protestant
</p>
<p>brother that I will not meddle with his creed if he will
</p>
<p>not meddle with mine ? Shall I tempt him to forget that
</p>
<p>he has no more right to his religious views than he has to
</p>
<p>my purse, or my house, or my lifeblood ? No. Catholicism

<p>do not make four, as this theory of religious liberty. Its
</p>
<p>impiety is only equalled by its absurdity."
</p>
<p>This was republished and indorsed by the Shepherd of
</p>
<p>the Valley, a Romish paper at St. Louis.
</p>
<p>Bishop Kenrick also is quoted by the Independent Irish-
</p>
<p>man as saying,
</p>
<p>" Heresy and unbelief are CRIMES ; that is the whole of
</p>
<p>the matter. And in Christian countries, as in Italy and
</p>
<p>Spain for instance, where all the people are Catholic,
</p>
<p>and where the Catholic religion is an essential part of the
</p>
<p>law of the land, they will be punished as other crimes."
</p>
<p>The Bishop of St. Louis also is quoted by him as say-
</p>
<p>ing.
</p>
<p>"Protestantism of every kind Catholicity inserts in her
</p>
<p>catalogue of mortal sins ; she endures it when and where
</p>
<p>she must ; but she hates it, and directs all her energies to
</p>
<p>effect its destruction. If the Catholics ever gain, which
</p>
<p>they surely will do, an immense numerical majority, re-
</p>
<p>ligious freedom in this country is at an end."*
</p>
<p>Honestly they cannot say any thing else ; and clearly
</p>
<p>the principles of Brownson, with reference to the de-
</p>
<p>cisions of the pope and the church in the middle ages,
</p>
<p>involve all this, and also a full sanction of all their doc-
</p>
<p>trines, as to fraud, treachery, and falsehood, towards all
</p>
<p>out of the pale of the Romish church. They involve the
</p>
<p>maxim, which once he repudiated with indignation, that
</p>
<p>no faith is to be kept with heretics.
</p>
<p>All of these decisions are, as truly as any others, the an-
</p>
<p>swers of the church on great practical questions, and have-
</p>
<p>become historical. To these he ought to apply his own
</p>
<p>words.

</p>
<p>prevailing public opinion denounces ; but there they stand
</p>
<p>on the page of history, and can be neither honestly nor
</p>
<p>successfully denied or explained away. What the church
</p>
<p>has done, what she has expressly or tacitly approved in
</p>
<p>the past, that is exactly what she will do, expressly or
</p>
<p>tacitly approve, in the future, if the same circumstances
</p>
<p>occur. This may be a difficulty, an embarrasment ; but it
</p>
<p>will not do to shrink from it. We are responsible for the
</p>
<p>past history of the church in so far as she herself has
</p>
<p>acted ; and to attempt to apologize for it by an appeal to
</p>
<p>the opinion of the times, or to explain it in conformity
</p>
<p>with the prevailing spirit and theories of non- Catholics
</p>
<p>in our age, is only to weaken the reverence of the faithful
</p>
<p>for the church and yield the victory to her enemies."
</p>
<p>This part of the subject, then, is plain. The real and
</p>
<p>infamous doctrines of the Romish corporation on veracity
</p>
<p>and the rights of Protestants can neither be concealed nor
</p>
<p>evaded.
</p>
<p>The question of their power to gain the ascendency in
</p>
<p>this nation, and to carry out such principles, is not at
</p>
<p>present under discussion. Our present purpose is to en-
</p>
<p>able all candid men to decide what the principles of the
</p>
<p>Romish corporation are, to see that they are immutable,
</p>
<p>and that nothing will prevent them from carrying them
</p>
<p>out but want of power.
</p>
<p>Have I not, then, proved the propositions which I have
</p>
<p>announced ? Do not the pope and his corporation place
</p>
<p>their own interests above all others whatever? Do they
</p>
<p>not at once disfranchise all who renounce their authority ?
</p>
<p>Do they not declare all their rights vacated ? Do they
</p>
<p>not declare that all obligations of veracity and fidelity
</p>
<p>towards them cease ; that all claims of protection or de-
</p>
<p>fence are vacated ; that they are at once outlawed and in-

</p>
<p>But there is a still lower depth of treachery into which

<p>the chief defenders of this system have fallen. The Jesuits

<p>advocate and defend all that I have stated, because they
</p>
<p>are the sworn defenders of the Pope of Rome.

<p>CHAPTER XI.
</p>
<p>THE JESUITS ON LYING.
</p>
<p>WE are called on by divine Providence, as American
</p>
<p>citizens, not only to sit in judgment on the principles of the
</p>
<p>great central Romish corporation as to truth and human
</p>
<p>rights, but also of those subordinate corporations which are
</p>
<p>banded together in one great conspiracy to sustain and
</p>
<p>extend the authority of the central power.
</p>
<p>Of these, by far the most powerful and notorious is the
</p>
<p>order of the Jesuits. It arose soon after the reformation,
</p>
<p>and was organized for the express purpose of resisting its
</p>
<p>progress. It has rendered itself so infamous that it was
</p>
<p>once suppressed ; yet it was so essential to the Papacy
</p>
<p>that it has been again revived, and, under its head at
</p>
<p>Rome, is again pervading the world.
</p>
<p>It developed a code of morals which, as a whole, is per-
</p>
<p>fectly diabolical. It is not, however, my purpose here to
</p>
<p>expound that code in full, but to show that, on the great
</p>
<p>question of veracity, it is a fit exemplification of the au-
</p>
<p>thorized principles and general tendencies of the system
</p>
<p>of Rome. We should naturally expect this, since they
</p>
<p>have ever been the chief defenders of the see of Rome.
</p>
<p>It will not, then, be deemed an accidental coincidence if
</p>
<p>we find them engaged in reducing the principles of lying,
</p>
<p>perjury, and slander to a systematic form. Their labors
</p>
<p>in this department I shall proceed to review.

</p>
<p>THE JESUITS ON LYING. Ill
</p>
<p>Nor is this needless. No body of men are making such
</p>
<p>efforts to extend their power throughout our land. They
</p>
<p>know well that in consequence of their former conduct
</p>
<p>their order still rests under a load of infamy that has
</p>
<p>made the very name Jesuit a proverb, and a byword, and
</p>
<p>a hissing, and the terms Jesuitical and diabolical well
</p>
<p>nigh synonymous in the public mind.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brownson, therefore, in his newborn zeal for Ro-
</p>
<p>manism, has felt himself especially called on to vindicate
</p>
<p>these servants of the Papacy, as in a preeminent degree
</p>
<p>hated and slandered for righteousness' sake.
</p>
<p>It is, therefore, a work of no common interest and im-
</p>
<p>portance to investigate the avowed principles of the lead-
</p>
<p>ing authors .of this order of men as it regards speaking
</p>
<p>the truth in our dealings with our fellow-men.
</p>
<p>To any one who has ever read the letters of Pascal
</p>
<p>there is little need to say much on this point. He made
</p>
<p>it notorious throughout the civilized world that their most
</p>
<p>prominent writers on morals totally subverted by their
</p>
<p>doctrines the very foundations of truth in the intercourse
</p>
<p>of man with man.
</p>
<p>I will but quote a few of their profligate maxims from
</p>
<p>the works of their standard authors. Pascal gives from
</p>
<p>Sanchez the following choice specimens of morality :
</p>
<p>" It is lawful to use ambiguous terms, to give the impres-
</p>
<p>sion a different sense from that which you yourself under-
</p>
<p>stand." Op. Mor., p. 2, b. iii. c. vi. n. 13.
</p>
<p>In the same place he says, " A person may take an oath
</p>
<p>that he has not done such a thing, though in fact he has,
</p>
<p>by saying to himself it was not done on a certain specified
</p>
<p>day, or before he was born, or by concealing any other
</p>
<p>circumstance which gives another meaning to the state-

</p>
<p>rent, and is always very just when it is necessary to your
</p>
<p>health, honor, or property."
</p>
<p>Again : " It is the intention which stamps the character
</p>
<p>of the action."
</p>
<p>To illustrate this, Escobar, tr. iii. ex. iii. n. 48, gives
</p>
<p>this general rule :
</p>
<p>" Promises are not obligatory when a man has no inten-
</p>
<p>tion of being bound to fulfil them."
</p>
<p>Again : Bourne quotes from Sanchez, Op. Mor., lib. i.
</p>
<p>cap. x. Nos. 12, 13, p. 49 : " An oath, obliges not beyond
</p>
<p>the intention of him who takes it." Here we have the fa-
</p>
<p>mous Jesuitical doctrine of " directing the intention " so
</p>
<p>as to promise or swear any thing that is desired, either
</p>
<p>for the church or for individual interest, and yet not be
</p>
<p>bound.
</p>
<p>The mode by which a Jesuit or any Romanist can enter
</p>
<p>a Protestant church by oath or covenant, without sin, is
</p>
<p>thus given, Bauny Sum., cap. vi. cone. iv. p. 73 : " He
</p>
<p>who maintains an heretical proposition without believing
</p>
<p>it, or who is a communicant among the Protestants with-
</p>
<p>out having his heart there, but out of pure derision, or to
</p>
<p>comply with the times, and to accomplish his designs, ought
</p>
<p>not to be esteemed a Protestant, because his understand-
</p>
<p>ing is not infected with error."
</p>
<p>As to truth in civil courts, Taberna, vol. ii. part ii.
</p>
<p>tract, ii. cap. xxxi. p. 288, speaks thus : " Is a witness
</p>
<p>bound to declare the truth before a legitimate judge ? No,
</p>
<p>if his deposition will injure himself, his family, or prop-
</p>
<p>erty, or if he be a priest i for a priest cannot be forced to tes-
</p>
<p>tify before a secular judge "
</p>
<p>Again: Layman, lib. iv. tract, iii. cap. i. p. 78 : "It is
</p>
<p>not sufficient for an oath that we use the formal words, if
</p>
<p>we have not the intention and wiH to swear" (See McGaviu's

</p>
<p>THE JESUITS ON LYING. 113
</p>
<p>It is worthy of notice that these profligate principles
</p>
<p>go beyond the maxim, that it is right to lie for ecclesias-
</p>
<p>tical utility. They subvert the foundations of truth in all
</p>
<p>things. No matter what words a man uses, if he secretly
</p>
<p>intends something else, he is not bound by promises or
</p>
<p>by oaths.
</p>
<p>No less damnable are their doctrines as to slander.
</p>
<p>These, of course, have a wide range, and have been ex-
</p>
<p>tensively used by the Jesuits in controversies and in
</p>
<p>blackening the characters of Protestants. They there-
</p>
<p>fore sustain an intimate relation to the management of all
</p>
<p>controversies between Komanists and Protestants. It is
</p>
<p>an obvious dictate of honor to avoid personalities in ar-
</p>
<p>gument and to confine the attention to principles and
</p>
<p>facts. Especially is it a dictate, not only of honor, but of
</p>
<p>the word of God, not to try to destroy the force of argu-
</p>
<p>ments by slandering their authors.
</p>
<p>When a writer has endeavored to throw light upon an
</p>
<p>important subject, and stated principles and sustained his
</p>
<p>assertions by documents of unquestioned authority, it may
</p>
<p>be much easier to slander him personally, and call him a liar,
</p>
<p>a drunkard, an adulterer, than to answer his arguments.
</p>
<p>But one would hardly expect that men who are such saints
</p>
<p>that the world is not worthy of them would sanction such
</p>
<p>a mode of proceeding. Yet this the Jesuits have done.
</p>
<p>Their maxim is this : " It is no mortal sin to oppose a slan-
</p>
<p>derer by slandering him." Of course they must judge who
</p>
<p>a slanderer is ; and it is very easy to conclude that who-
</p>
<p>ever says any thing to the disadvantage of the order of
</p>
<p>the Jesuits is a slanderer, and that it becomes no mortal
</p>
<p>sin to slander him. This was charged upon them by Pas-
</p>
<p>cal in his fifteenth Provincial Letter, without the slightest
</p>
<p>hesitation, as a notorious principle of theirs ; and he sus-
</p>
<p>tained his charge by such an array of evidence that no

</p>
<p>114 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>Jesuit to this day has been able in the slightest degree to
</p>
<p>destroy its force. Let us listen to the charge in the
</p>
<p>words of Pascal :
</p>
<p>"It is my purpose. to advance a step farther than merely
</p>
<p>to show that your writings are replete with calumnious
</p>
<p>representations. Falsehoods may be stated under an im-
</p>
<p>pression that they are truths ; but lying is characterized by
</p>
<p>the intention to deceive. I shall show that you design to
</p>
<p>deceive and calumniate, and that you purposely impute
</p>
<p>crimes to your enemies of which you know they are per-
</p>
<p>fectly innocent, because you believe it may be done with-
</p>
<p>out falling from a state of grace. And, though you may
</p>
<p>be as well acquainted as myself with this point of your
</p>
<p>morality, I shall beg permission to state it, that no further
</p>
<p>doubt may exist, by showing that I challenge you person-
</p>
<p>ally and individually on the subject, without even your
</p>
<p>being able to deny it, with all your assurance, unless at the
</p>
<p>same time you own that for which I reproach you. For this
</p>
<p>is a doctrine so common in your schools that you have not
</p>
<p>only maintained it in your writings, but even in your public
</p>
<p>theses, which is an act of the utmost presumption as, for
</p>
<p>example, in that of Louvain, in the year 1645, in the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing words : ' It is only a venial sin to calumniate and
</p>
<p>ruin the credit of such as speak evil of you by accusing them
</p>
<p>of false crimes ' Quidni non nisi veniale sit, detrahentis
</p>
<p>auctoritatem magnam tibi noxiam falso crimine elidere ?
</p>
<p>This doctrine is so current amongst you that whoever
</p>
<p>dares to attack it you treat as an ignoramus and a stu-
</p>
<p>pid fellow."
</p>
<p>To one who has been brought up in a Protestant coun-
</p>
<p>try, and who is happily ignorant of those unfathomable
</p>
<p>depths of Satan into which the system of Romanism can
</p>
<p>sink the human mind, it seems impossible that any body
</p>
<p>of men pretending to call themselves Christians should ever

</p>
<p>have dared to teach such doctrines of devils, or could have
</p>
<p>so seared their consciences with a hot iron as thus to au-
</p>
<p>thorize and sanction the grossest slander, and even to
</p>
<p>THE JESUITS ON LYING. 115
</p>
<p>treat as an ignoramus and a stupid fellow whoever dares
</p>
<p>to attack such doctrines.
</p>
<p>Listen, then, to the unanswerable proof of his asser-
</p>
<p>tions which Pascal produces :
</p>
<p>" Not long ago this took place in regard to Father Qui-
</p>
<p>roga, a German capuchin, who opposed this doctrine, and
</p>
<p>was immediately attacked by Father Dicastillus, who
</p>
<p>speaks of this dispute in these terms, (De Just., 1. ii. tr. ii.
</p>
<p>disp. xii. n. 404 :) ' A certain grave friar, barefooted and
</p>
<p>deep cowled, cucuttatus, gymnopoda, whose name I shall
</p>
<p>conceal, had the temerity to decry this opinion amongst
</p>
<p>some women and ignorant people as pernicious and scan-
</p>
<p>dalous, contrary to good manners, subversive of the peace
</p>
<p>of states and societies, and opposed, not only to all the
</p>
<p>Catholic doctors, but to all who may become so. But I
</p>
<p>have maintained against him, and still maintain, that cal-
</p>
<p>umny, when made use of against a calumniator, though it

<p>be a lie, yet is not a mortal sin, nor contrary to justice

<p>or charity ; and, as a demonstration of this, I furnished

<p>him with a crowd of our fathers and whole universities
</p>
<p>whom I consulted, among others the Rev. Father John

<p>Gans, confessor to the emperor ; the Rev. Father Daniel

<p>Bastele, confessor to the Archduke Leopold ; Father

<p>Henry, who was the tutor of these two princes : all

<p>the public and ordinary professors of the University of

<p>of the University of Gratz, (all Jesuits ;) all the professors

<p>of the University of Prague, (of which the Jesuits are mas-

<p>ters ;) from all of whom I have in my possession a written,

<p>signed, and sealed approbation of my opinion ; in addition
</p>
<p>to which I have Father Pennalossa, a Jesuit, preacher to
</p>
<p>the emperor and the King of Spain ; Father Piliiceroli, a
</p>
<p>Jesuit ; and many others, who have all judged this opin-
</p>

<p>there are few opinions which you have taken so much
</p>
<p>pains to establish ; and, in fact, there are few which are
</p>
<p>so serviceable to you. For this reason, you have impressed
</p>
<p>so much authority upon it that your casuists have made
</p>
<p>use of it as an indubitable principle. ' It is certain/ says
</p>
<p>116 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>Caramuel, n. 1151, 'that it is a probable opinion that it
</p>
<p>is no mortal sin to bring a false accusation for the sake of
</p>
<p>preserving one's honor ; for it is maintained by upwards
</p>
<p>of twenty grave doctors, Gaspar Hurtado, Dicastillus, &c.
</p>
<p>Hence, if this doctrine be not probable, there is scarcely
</p>
<p>any one that is so in the whole system of divinity.' "
</p>
<p>Such is the proof adduced by Pascal ; and what can be
</p>
<p>more overwhelming ? And in what manner did the Jesu-
</p>
<p>its reply to it ? In an attempt to answer the Provincial
</p>
<p>Letters, published in Paris, 1659, p. 342, instead of condemn-
</p>
<p>ing Father Dicastillus's position, THEY ADDED MORE AUTHORI-
</p>
<p>TY TO IT, by citing several authors, besides those mentioned
</p>
<p>before, in defence of it.
</p>
<p>Let any one now reflect on the length and breadth of
</p>
<p>the principles involved in this doctrine of the Jesuits,
</p>
<p>and he will fully sympathize with Pascal in the strong
</p>
<p>language of abhorrence with which he speaks of the
</p>
<p>system :
</p>
<p>" 0, what an execrable system is this, and how utterly
</p>
<p>corrupt in all its main points and principles, that if this
</p>
<p>doctrine be not probable and safe in conscience, ' that a
</p>
<p>person may be accused falsely in order to preserve one's
</p>
<p>honor,' there is scarcely any one that is ! What can be
</p>
<p>more probable, fathers, than that those who hold this prin-
</p>
<p>ciple should sometimes put it in practice ? The depraved
</p>
<p>passions of mankind hurry them on with such impetuosity
</p>
<p>that it is inconceivable, when all conscientious scruples are
</p>
<p>done away, how violently they proceed. For instance,
</p>
<p>Caramuel writes in the same place, ' This maxim of Father
</p>
<p>Dicastillus the Jesuit, respecting calumny, was taught by
</p>
<p>a German countess to the daughter of the empress, who,
</p>
<p>believing that calumnies were but venial sins, spread
</p>
<p>abroad so many scandals and false reports every day that
</p>
<p>the whole court was put into a state of ferment and alarm.

<p>It is easy to perceive the use they made of it ; so that, to
</p>
<p>quiet this tumult, it was found necessary to apply to a
</p>
<p>good father, a capuchin, named Quiroga, of exemplary

<p>THE JESUITS ON LYING. 117
</p>
<p>conduct, (which was the reason Father Dicastillus had
</p>
<p>such a quarrel with him,) who told them plainly that this
</p>
<p>maxim was very pernicious, especially as held by women,
</p>
<p>and then took such especial care that the empress totally
</p>
<p>abolished the practice of it.'
</p>
<p>" It is by no means surprising that this doctrine should
</p>
<p>have produced some bad effects ; it would have been more
</p>
<p>so had it been otherwise. Self-love is always ready to
</p>
<p>persuade us that an attack made upon ourselves is unjust ;
</p>
<p>much more you, fathers, who are so blinded by vanity that
</p>
<p>you would make all the world believe, from your writings,
</p>
<p>that an injury attempted against your writings is an in-
</p>
<p>jury done to the honor of the church ; and thus it
</p>
<p>would be strange if you were not to pu this maxim in
</p>
<p>practice. We must not say, as those who do not know
</p>
<p>you do, How is it these good fathers calumniate their
</p>
<p>enemies, since it is endangering their own salvation ? But
</p>
<p>we must say, on the contrary, How is it these good fa-
</p>
<p>thers would" lose any opportunity of decrying their ene-
</p>
<p>mies when they can do it without risking their own safety ?
</p>
<p>Let us, then, no longer be astonished at finding the Jesuits
</p>
<p>calumniators. They are so with a safe conscience, and
</p>
<p>cannot be otherwise ; since, by the credit they have ac-
</p>
<p>quired in the world, they may revile others without any
</p>
<p>apprehension from the justice of men ; and, by that which,
</p>
<p>they have acquired in cases of conscience, they have estab-
</p>
<p>lished maxims by which they are empowered to do as
</p>
<p>they choose, without dreading the justice of God.
</p>
<p>Take an illustration of those principles from the same
</p>
<p>author :
</p>
<p>" A remarkable instance of this occurred in your disa-
</p>
<p>greement with 1L Puys, a clergyman of St. Nisier, at
</p>
<p>Lyons ; and, as this affair furnishes a complete illustration
</p>
<p>of your spirit, I shall relate the principal circumstances.

<p>You kno\v, fathers, that in 1649 M. Puys translated an
</p>
<p>excellent work, written by another capuchin, into French,
</p>
<p>' On the Duty of Christians to their own Parishes against
</p>
<p>those who wished to entice them away,' without using
</p>
<p>any invectives, and without either pointing to any religious

</p>
<p>order or individual. Your fathers, however, took it to
</p>
<p>themselves ; and, paying no respect to an aged pastor, a
</p>
<p>judge in the primacy of France, and much honored by the
</p>
<p>whole city, your Father Alby wrote a violent philippic
</p>
<p>against him, which you yourselves sold in your churches
</p>
<p>on Assumption day ; in which, amongst other charges, he
</p>
<p>was accused ' of becoming scandalous by his gallantries,
</p>
<p>of being suspected of impiety, of being a heretic, an ex-
</p>
<p>communicated person, and deserving to be burned alive.'
</p>
<p>To this M. Puys replied ; but Father Alby, in a second
</p>
<p>publication, persisted in his former recriminations. Is it
</p>
<p>not then evident, fathers, either that you must be calumni-
</p>
<p>ators, or that you believed all the charges brought against
</p>
<p>the good priest, and therefore that it was needful that
</p>
<p>you should have seen him fully exculpated before you
</p>
<p>deemed him worthy of your friendship ? Attend now to
</p>
<p>what passed at the reconciliation, in presence of a great
</p>
<p>multitude of the most distinguished persons of the city,
</p>
<p>whose names are inserted below in the order in which
</p>
<p>they were placed in the paper drawn up on the 25th of
</p>
<p>September, 1650.* In the presence of this assembly M.
</p>
<p>Puys made no other declaration than the following :
</p>
<p>' That what he had written was not intended for the Jesu-
</p>
<p>its ; that he had spoken in general against those who
</p>
<p>seduce the faithful from their parishes, without at all
</p>
<p>meaning to attack their society, for which, on the con-
</p>
<p>trary, he cherished a high regard.' This is in itself suf-
</p>
<p>ficient in regard to his apostasy, his revilings, and his
</p>
<p>excommunications, without any recantation or absolution.
</p>
<p>Father Alby afterwards addressed him in these words :
</p>
<p>'Sir, my conviction that you attacked the society to which
</p>
<p>I have the honor to belong induced me to take up my pen
</p>
<p>to answer you, and I thought my manner of doing it was

<p>allowable ; but I have become better acquainted with your

</p>
<p>can prevent my esteeming you as a person of very en-
</p>
<p>lightened understanding, of a profound and orthodox faith,
</p>
<p>of irreproachabk morals, and, in one word, a worthy pastor
</p>
<p>of your church. This declaration I make with high satis-
</p>
<p>faction, and beg these gentlemen to remember it.'
</p>
<p>" In truth, fathers, these gentlemen remember it perfectly
</p>
<p>well, and were more offended at your reconciliation than at
</p>
<p>your quarrel. For who does not admire Father Alby's
</p>
<p>speech ? He does not say that he retracts on account of dis-
</p>
<p>covering M. Puys has changed his behavior and his doctrine,
</p>
<p>but merely ' because he found that it was not his intention to
</p>
<p>attack your society ; so that there is nothing to prevent
</p>
<p>him from being a good Catholic.' He did not, therefore,
</p>
<p>believe him to be a heretic at all ; nevertheless, after
</p>
<p>accusing him of it, contrary to his own convictions, he
</p>
<p>does not acknowledge his error, but dares, on the contrary,
</p>
<p>to affirm ' that he believes the manner in which he used
</p>
<p>him was allowable.'
</p>
<p>" My good fathers, what can you be thinking about thus
</p>
<p>publicly to show that you only measure the faith and virtue
</p>
<p>of mankind by their opinions of your society ? How came
</p>
<p>it to pass that you were not apprehensive of making
</p>
<p>people believe, by your own confession, that you were im-
</p>
<p>postors and calumniators? What! shall the very same
</p>
<p>individual, and without any change in himself, but merely
</p>
<p>as he honors or opposes your society, be ' pious or impious,
</p>
<p>blameless or deserving excommunication, a worthy pastor
</p>
<p>of the church or fit only to be burned ; in one word, a
</p>
<p>Catholic or a heretic ' ? To oppose your society and to
</p>
<p>be a heretic are then, in your language, the same thing.
</p>
<p>A pretty kind of heresy indeed ! So, then, whenever
</p>
<p>one sees in your writings so many good Catholics called
</p>
<p>heretics, the meaning is, ' that you believe them to be in-

</p>
<p>Nor did this abominable system, thus opening the flood-
</p>
<p>gates of hell to pour forth all conceivable forms of slander
</p>
<p>on the world, remain a dead letter. It was put in force with

<p>corporation to oppose the Jesuits and to aid in the work
</p>
<p>of exposing their abominations, and is in full force to this
</p>
<p>day.
</p>
<p>I shall also show the existence of the same spirit and
</p>
<p>incipient attempts to practise on the same principles
</p>
<p>among us so far as they dare.
</p>
<p>"We have not, as yet, fully entered into the heart of the
</p>
<p>Papal war, and have not yet been compelled to learn
</p>
<p>what poisoned weapons of moral assassination the Jesuits
</p>
<p>and other leading advocates of the Papacy have in other
</p>
<p>ages used without scruple. But as it is a settled point
</p>
<p>that we are to meet that system in one more conflict, and
</p>
<p>that the last, it becomes us to study diligently the weapons
</p>
<p>with which it has always fought in former wars, and to be
</p>
<p>strong in the Lord and in the power of his might to arm
</p>
<p>ourselves against it with the whole armor of God.
</p>
<p>There is the more reason for this, inasmuch as the Ro-
</p>
<p>mish corporation has recently sanctioned and adopted the
</p>
<p>morality of the Jesuits, which was rendered justly infa-
</p>
<p>mous in Europe by the exposure of its enormities and
</p>
<p>abominations made by Pascal. This system, with all its
</p>
<p>diabolism, is incorporated in the works of St. Alphonso
</p>
<p>de Liguori ; but these works are solemnly sanctioned by
</p>
<p>the Romish corporation, if we may trust Dr. Wiseman.
</p>
<p>He tells us that his works "do not contain any propo-
</p>
<p>sition .that is pernicious, erroneous, or rash," and that
</p>
<p>"the morals of this saintly bishop cannot be censured
</p>
<p>without setting up as a censor of authority itself, with-
</p>
<p>out, in fine, censuring the decisions of the holy see." The
</p>
<p>morals of this diabolical saint justify assassination, and
</p>
<p>open murder in certain "cases, as well as lying and per-
</p>
<p>jury. Never, therefore, were the morals of Rome so dia-

<p>CHAPTER XII.
</p>
<p>CAUTIONS TO AMERICANS IN VIEW OF MODERN EXEMPLIFI-
</p>
<p>CATIONS OF THE PRINCIPLES OF LYING AND PERJURY.
</p>
<p>IF, in view of all the preceding statements, any one
</p>
<p>should say, After all, these are ancient principles and
</p>
<p>facts ; things are now changed for the better : it is not
</p>
<p>charitable or honorable to suppose that Romish bishops or
</p>
<p>laymen among us will deem it a merit to lie or perjure
</p>
<p>themselves for purposes of ecclesiastical utility, I would
</p>
<p>request him, before coming to this conclusion, to open his
</p>
<p>eyes on some very instructive and significant facts, most
</p>
<p>of them of modern date.
</p>
<p>The idea that any Romanist will take oaths of allegiance
</p>
<p>to our country that he does not mean to'keep is often re-
</p>
<p>pudiated as a slanderous imputation on honorable men.
</p>
<p>They say this under the influence of their own Protestant
</p>
<p>views, not reflecting that Romanism not only justifies, but
</p>
<p>encourages, such false swearing for the good of the church.
</p>
<p>If any are incredulous, then let them consider the case
</p>
<p>of Judge Gaston, a distinguished Romanist of North
</p>
<p>Carolina.
</p>
<p>The facts of the case are these : The constitution of
</p>
<p>that state was made when all intelligent men coincided
</p>
<p>with the views expressed by the Continental Congress
</p>
<p>in an address to the people o Great Britain, dated Oc-
</p>
<p>tober 31, 1774.

</p>
<p>122 THE .PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>In this, after expostulating against the favor shown to
</p>
<p>the Romanists of Canada as dangerous to the liberties of
</p>
<p>the Protestant colonies, they say, " Nor can we suppress
</p>
<p>our astonishment that a British Parliament should ever
</p>
<p>consent to establish in that country A RELIGION THAT HAS
</p>
<p>DELUGED YOUR ISLAND IN BLOOD, and dispersed IMPIETY,
</p>
<p>BIGOTRY, PERSECUTION, MURDER, AND REBELLION through
</p>
<p>every part of the world." So thought the patriots of the
</p>
<p>revolution.
</p>
<p>Under the influence of such convictions, the framers of
</p>
<p>the constitution of North Carolina determined to exclude
</p>
<p>Romanists from office in that state, and inserted an article
</p>
<p>to that effect. The facts as to Judge Gaston I give in the
</p>
<p>words of Dr. Breckenridge, in his able work entitled
</p>
<p>Papism in the United States in the Nineteenth Century.
</p>
<p>After stating that he was one of the most distinguished
</p>
<p>citizens of the state and one of her ablest lawyers, he
</p>
<p>says,
</p>
<p>" By the constitution of North Carolina, he is expressly
</p>
<p>disqualified to hold the office he occupies, precisely because
</p>
<p>he chooses to be a Catholic. In the thirty-second article it
</p>
<p>is thus written : ' That no person who shall deny the being
</p>
<p>Of God, OR THE TRUTH OF THE PROTESTANT RELIGION, Or
</p>
<p>the divine authority either of the Old or New Testaments,
</p>
<p>or u'ho shall hold religious principles incompatible with the
</p>
<p>freedom, and safety of the state, shall be capable of holding
</p>
<p>any office, or place of trust or profit, in the civil govern-
</p>
<p>ment within this state.' Now, Mr. Gaston is at this
</p>
<p>moment a judge of the Court of Appeals of North Caro-
</p>
<p>lina. Before he took his seat on the bench, he took an
</p>
<p>oath in some usual form to support the constitution of that
</p>
<p>state. Part of that constitution asserts and assumes the
</p>
<p>truth of the Protestant religion. But Mr. Gaston is an
</p>
<p>avowed and most decided Papist. Now, will he do him-

</p>
<p>CAUTIONS TO AMERICANS. 123
</p>
<p>" Mr. Gaston has sworn to maintain ' THE TRUTH OP THE
</p>
<p>PROTESTANT RELIGION ;' he has sworn to maintain a con-
</p>
<p>stitution which disqualifies him the moment he shall
</p>
<p>' deny the truth of the, Protestant religion ; ' and yet he is
</p>
<p>confessedly a Papist a believer in all the necessary
</p>
<p>dogmas, and a member in full exercise of all the privileges,
</p>
<p>of that faith which the creed of Pope Pius IV. pronounces
</p>
<p>to be exclusive not only, but indispensable to salvation
</p>
<p>that church which declares itself to be, and which all who
</p>
<p>repeat its creed promise and swear to maintain as, the
</p>
<p>' mother and MISTRESS' of all churches, and to use all
</p>
<p>diligence, by all means in their power, to spread all around
</p>
<p>them. In the name of common honesty, how could Judge
</p>
<p>Gaston assent to the creed of Pope Pius IV., which is the au-
</p>
<p>thorized creed of his church, and at the same time assent to
</p>
<p>the provision quoted above from the constitution of North
</p>
<p>Carolina ? Can a man swear with a good conscience to
</p>
<p>opposite facts, statements, and opinions ? "
</p>
<p>After a full discussion of the subject, he comes to this
</p>
<p>conclusion :
</p>
<p>" If I had acted as Judge Gaston has, my sect would
</p>
<p>have deposed me from the ministry, my congregation
</p>
<p>would have shut my church doors against me, my friends
</p>
<p>would have wept over me as one undone, and the whole
</p>
<p>world would have had but one opinion about it ; and that
</p>
<p>opinion would have been, that I was a degraded man.
</p>
<p>Then why not mete the same measure to Judge Gaston ?
</p>
<p>I will tell you why. It is because Judge Gaston is a Papist j
</p>
<p>and his creed admits and approves his conduct. Arid, there-
</p>
<p>fore, let every man that loves God pity and forgive Judge
</p>
<p>Gaston, and frown down his pestiferous superstition, as
</p>
<p>the parent of all vice and the enemy of every virtue."
</p>
<p>The criminal apathy of the press on a point so momen-
</p>
<p>tous he thus explains :

</p>
<p>whole editorial corps converted, subsidized, afraid, or

</p>
<p>totally indifferent ? No ; this is by no means so. If a
</p>
<p>Methodist judge should take a false oath, or a Presbyte-
</p>
<p>rian judge commit a flagrant violation of morality, or an
</p>
<p>Episcopal judge outrage public decency, or a Deistical
</p>
<p>judge be guilty of deliberate perfidy in official affairs, in
</p>
<p>all these cases the public press would fully respond to the
</p>
<p>public feeling, and the judge would be disgraced, if not
</p>
<p>degraded. Why deal out a different measure to a Catholic
</p>
<p>judge? I will tell you why. It is because every Catholic
</p>
<p>in the world makes common cause with every other
</p>
<p>Catholic in the world, and with the Pope of Rome, as the
</p>
<p>head of all the world, and with the Catholic church, as the
</p>
<p>mother and mistress of all the churches in the world.

<p>Virtue is nothing, truth is nothing, religion is nothing,

<p>country is nothing, liberty is nothing ; the church is ALL,
</p>
<p>and the pope its head ; and all its true members form one
</p>
<p>universal conspiracy against every good of man and the
</p>
<p>honor of God himself. Printers feel the force, though
</p>
<p>they may deny the reality, of this conspiracy."
</p>
<p>The case of Judge Gaston is fearfully significant. His
</p>
<p>church has solemnly decided that an oath contrary to
</p>
<p>ecclesiastical utility is not binding. He simply believes
</p>
<p>the church, and acts accordingly ; or else, according to
</p>
<p>the Jesuits, he swears, not intending to do what he swears.
</p>
<p>And what oath or promise is there that these same
</p>
<p>principles will not dissolve ? No matter who it is, whether
</p>
<p>bishop or layman, who swears allegiance to a national or
</p>
<p>a state government, his oath does not bind him in any
</p>
<p>case in which the pope or the bishops shall decide that
</p>
<p>ecclesiastical utility requires its violation.
</p>
<p>On the same principles, any Romanist, whether layman
</p>
<p>or ecclesiastic, can profess to be a Protestant, and join any
</p>
<p>Protestant church, for the sake of acting the more ef-
</p>
<p>fectually to undermine Protestantism and to extend the

</p>
<p>on a great scale. Why should it not be so ? According
</p>
<p>to the supreme authority of the church, and Jesuit morality
</p>
<p>also, it is so far from being wrong that it is highly meri-
</p>
<p>torious. In the same way men or women may assume any
</p>
<p>disguise, and act under any profession, in order to subserve
</p>
<p>the interests of the church.
</p>
<p>On the same ground, a Romish bishop may in the most
</p>
<p>solemn and public manner proclaim as true and undeniable
</p>
<p>what he knows to be utterly false ; as, for example, in the
</p>
<p>case of a public discussion.
</p>
<p>Thus Bishop Purcell, in his controversy in Cincinnati with
</p>
<p>A. Campbell, denied in the most solemn manner that a
</p>
<p>passage quoted by Campbell from a compend of the morals
</p>
<p>of St. Liguori was ever written by him. He said to the
</p>
<p>audience, " I now pledge myself to show to every man of
</p>
<p>honor in this city that the last allegation read by the
</p>
<p>gentleman, purporting to be from the works of Liguori, is
</p>
<p>not to be found in the works of that writer. It is all a
</p>
<p>base fabrication, I will not say of Mr. C., but of somebody.
</p>
<p>I will meet this charge with a complete and an overwhelm-
</p>
<p>ing refutation." Much more of the same kind of declama-
</p>
<p>tion he employed, and produced the desired effect for the
</p>
<p>time. But what was the fact ? It was proved, after the
</p>
<p>debate was over and there had been time to hear from
</p>
<p>New York from the author of the compend, that it was in
</p>
<p>the works of Liguori, and was properly translated. It
</p>
<p>was found in the bishop's own copy. This extract, how-
</p>
<p>ever, revealed the fact, that although the church will ex-
</p>
<p>communicate a priest for marrying a wife, yet the council
</p>
<p>of Trent only imposed fines on those priests who kept con-
</p>
<p>cubines ; and Liguori taught that a bishop ought to appro-
</p>
<p>priate these finesybr pious uses ! It is not to be wondered
</p>
<p>at that the bishop's ideas of ecclesiastical utility led him
</p>
<p>to feel that it was desirable, at least during the debate, to

</p>
<p>break the force of such statements of Liguori, and there-
</p>
<p>fore he indignantly called them a base fabrication. (See
</p>
<p>Debate, pp. 219, 253, and note at the end.) This is the
</p>
<p>same bishop who used to manifest great zeal for the public
</p>
<p>schools of Cincinnati before the people, when at the same
</p>
<p>time he was writing to Europe denunciations of them as
</p>
<p>pernicious and dangerous. That he was so doing became
</p>
<p>manifest by the publication of one or more of his letters
</p>
<p>in Europe, which found their way to this country, and were
</p>
<p>translated and published for the benefit of the good peo-
</p>
<p>ple of Cincinnati. The pope, of course, saw fit to remove
</p>
<p>him, after this exposure, to some other post of honor, and
</p>
<p>no doubt rewarded him for his zeal in behalf of ecclesi-
</p>
<p>astical utility.
</p>
<p>In like manner Pope Pius VI. did not hesitate to lie in
</p>
<p>order to remove the odium of the doctrines of the church
</p>
<p>in Great Britain. As quoted by Bishop Kenrick, p. 471
</p>
<p>Primacy, he says, not ex cathedra and in his own name,
</p>
<p>be it noticed, but through Cardinal Antonelli, " The see
</p>
<p>of Rome never taught that faith is not to be kept with
</p>
<p>the heterodox ; that an oath to kings separated from the
</p>
<p>Catholic communion can be violated ; that it is lawful for
</p>
<p>the Bishop of Rome to invade their temporal rights and
</p>
<p>dominions." Now, even if the pope had said this ex ca-
</p>
<p>thedra it would be of no force, for it is a mere assertion
</p>
<p>as to historical facts, and he is not held even by Roman-
</p>
<p>ists to be infallible as to such facts, but only as to doc-
</p>
<p>trines and principles of faith ; and it is merely a denial
</p>
<p>of facts as notorious as his own existence. He might as
</p>
<p>well have said that Luther, and Calvin, and the reforma-
</p>
<p>tion never existed as to make the notoriously false state-
</p>
<p>ment above quoted.
</p>
<p>But it was done for the sake of aiding the Romanists

</p>
<p>privileges ; and there is no reason why a pope should not
</p>
<p>lie for ecclesiastical utility as -well as any other bishop or
</p>
<p>any layman.
</p>
<p>Thus, also, we explain the fact that the deaths of Cal-
</p>
<p>vin, Luther, Zwingle, (Ecolampadius. and Carolstadt were
</p>
<p>deliberately and grossly misrepresented by leading Pa-
</p>
<p>pists. It was done on grounds of ecclesiastical utility, in
</p>
<p>order to convey to their own party the idea that these
</p>
<p>enemies of Popery died as heretics beneath the manifest
</p>
<p>wrath of God. Bishop Stratford has written a large and
</p>
<p>able tract, designed to expose and refute these most atro-
</p>
<p>cious falsehoods. But such men as Cardinal Bellarmine
</p>
<p>the Jesuit, and others concerned in this work of slander,
</p>
<p>were simply carrying out the doctrine of their own order
</p>
<p>as to slander, and of the church as to lying for ecclesias-
</p>
<p>tical utility.
</p>
<p>For the same reason, at Rome the Jesuit teachers of
</p>
<p>Raffaele Ciocci, as he informs us, constantly told him,
</p>
<p>when a youth, " that the Protestants did not worship
</p>
<p>Christ ; that they slaughtered each other daily like fero-
</p>
<p>cious beasts ; that they put the Roman Catholics to death ;
</p>
<p>that they attended to no civil restrictions, but continually
</p>
<p>lived in a state of anarchy. These misrepresentations,
</p>
<p>these diabolical assertions, were received by me as in-
</p>
<p>controvertible truths." (See his Narrative, p. 13.)
</p>
<p>Also in a monastery the monks suppressed his letters to
</p>
<p>his parents, and theirs to him, and forged a correspond-
</p>
<p>ence on both sides, in order to induce him to sign a
</p>
<p>deed giving all his property to the monastery. Narra-
</p>

</p>

<p>faith. The case of Hannah Corcoran, of Charlestown,
</p>
<p>128 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>Massachusetts, will illustrate this statement. She was
</p>
<p>carried off for choosing to become a Protestant. Neither
</p>
<p>priests nor relations knew where she was ; but when it be-
</p>
<p>came evident that an indignant community would not hold
</p>
<p>them guiltless she was soon found and restored. And
</p>
<p>through all the case there was no scruple to use false-
</p>
<p>hood to any extent.
</p>
<p>On the same principles, promises are freely made not to
</p>
<p>interfere with the religious principles of the children of
</p>
<p>Protestants in their schools, which are of course violated
</p>
<p>without scruple ; and children have even been taught to
</p>
<p>deceive their parents, in order to avoid their opposition or
</p>
<p>censure.
</p>
<p>We shall never understand such facts until we fully
</p>
<p>comprehend their doctrines as to lying as I have ex-
</p>
<p>plained them. Their system so debases and corrupts
</p>
<p>their moral sense that they regard the most atrocious
</p>
<p>lying for " ecclesiastical utility " as not merely no sin, but
</p>
<p>a positive merit.
</p>
<p>At the time of the Gunpowder Plot in England, de-
</p>
<p>signed to blow up and destroy the king and House of
</p>
<p>Lords and Commons, Catesby, one of the conspirators,
</p>
<p>consulted Father Garnet, the superior of the Jesuits,
</p>
<p>whether " it were lawful to promote the good of the Ro-
</p>
<p>man cause by destroying some innocent among many
</p>
<p>guilty." Garnet answered, "If the advantage of the
</p>
<p>Catholic cause were greater by destroying some innocent
</p>
<p>with many guilty, it was certainly lawful to kill and de-
</p>
<p>stroy them all."
</p>
<p>As to the propriety of blowing up the Protestants, it
</p>
<p>seems, there could be no doubt. The only question was,
</p>
<p>Was it right to blow up a few Romanists also who would
</p>
<p>be present? His reply we have seen. Ecclesiastical util-

<p>ity outweighed all else.

<p>CAUTIONS TO AMERICANS. 129
</p>
<p>When arrested and tried for treason as an accomplice
</p>
<p>in the plot, he alleged that he received the knowledge of
</p>
<p>the plot in confession, and therefore could not lawfully
</p>
<p>reveal it. It was proved, however, that he did not re-
</p>
<p>ceive the knowledge of it in confession.
</p>
<p>He also solemnly declared on his priesthood that he
</p>
<p>had had no correspondence with Greenwell (a conspira-
</p>
<p>tor) since they had met at Caughton. Yet at this very
</p>
<p>time the judges had in their hands letters of his which he
</p>
<p>had written to Greenwell since that time. On seeing the
</p>
<p>letters he confessed the fact, but, when censured, defended
</p>
<p>his perjury on the principles of his order, as right. He
</p>
<p>died, moreover, with another lie in his mouth, and secretly
</p>
<p>wrote to his friends to lie for him after his death. In all
</p>
<p>this he was but following the rule of ecclesiastical utility
</p>
<p>and the Jesuit code of morals, and was esteemed in other
</p>
<p>respects as a learned, amiable, and eminent man. But his
</p>
<p>system brought him to the death of a perjured traitor.
</p>
<p>But why should I continue the painful work of illustra-
</p>
<p>tion and proof? Call to mind the holy coat of Treves ;
</p>
<p>call to mind the pretended miracles of modern times ; call
</p>
<p>to mind the deceptions as to relics and hallowed medals,
</p>
<p>with power to avert or cure diseases.
</p>
<p>The ecclesiastics who do these things are not ignorant
</p>
<p>men. They know better. They delude and defraud the
</p>
<p>people on principle and systematically. Hardly can we

<p>call such frauds pious frauds. They better merit the name

<p>of barefaced swindling. And yet even Romish bishops do

<p>not hesitate to engage in such proceedings, and to use all

<p>their power to deceive and gull the simple and ignorant

<p>masses, who look up to them for instruction as to the ora-

<p>the favor of God ; which regards all Protestants as pa-

<p>chises them, and has shed the blood of millions, ought at

<p>least to have some peculiar and preeminent merits of its

<p>sans, but its internal structure, its mode of operation, its
</p>
<p>tendencies, and its results. If a company of inquisitors
</p>
<p>were to introduce into this city various instruments of
</p>
<p>torture such as the fertile genius of the Romish corpora-
</p>
<p>tion has so abundantly devised, and carry them to a large
</p>
<p>building recently erected, calling them, at the same time,
</p>
<p>musical instruments, it is probable that such a name would
</p>
<p>exert but little influence in satisfying the mind of the com-
</p>
<p>munity of the benevolent nature of their designs, in erect-
</p>
<p>ing the building and introducing the instruments. They
</p>
<p>would consider their structure, their mode of operation,
</p>
<p>their tendencies, and natural results. They would, after
</p>
<p>considering these points, probably conclude that they were
</p>
<p>instruments of torture, and that the only music that would
</p>
<p>ever be produced by them would be that of groans and
</p>
<p>shrieks of agony.
</p>
<p>So it should be little to us that the Romish corporation
</p>
<p>calls itself a church, and professes to aim at promoting
</p>
<p>the glory of God and the welfare of man. In a case of
</p>
<p>so much moment, we should not be deceived by names and
</p>
<p>pretences. We ought thoroughly to examine the struc-
</p>
<p>ture of the system itself, notice its tendencies, and inquire
</p>
<p>what it has in fact done during its long history.
</p>
<p>To prevent all misunderstanding, however, it is neces-
</p>
<p>sary at this point to remark that we are to view the sys-
</p>
<p>tem of Romanism in reference to those things which it has
</p>
<p>in distinction from and in opposition to Protestantism,
</p>
<p>laying out of the account any doctrines that it has in com-
</p>
<p>mon with Protestantism.
</p>
<p>This is but equitable ; for any good which may result
</p>
<p>from such doctrines as it has in common with Protestant-
</p>
<p>ism certainly ought not to be set down to its credit as
</p>
<p>Romanism ; for it exists, not on account of the peculiar-

</p>
<p>ities of Romanism, but in spite of them.
</p>
<p>THE CASE STATED. PRINCIPLES OF JUDGMENT. 133
</p>
<p>Thus, though Romanism avows a belief of the being of
</p>
<p>a God, and receives the Bible as his word, and has in its
</p>
<p>doctrinal system many elements of truth which may be so
</p>
<p>arranged as to meet the wants of holy minds, yet this is
</p>
<p>nothing to its credit as Romanism ; for the doctrine con-
</p>
<p>cerning God, and the Bible, and the same elements of truth
</p>
<p>are-found without that system among the Protestants, and
</p>
<p>operate there with much greater energy, and with less to
</p>
<p>counteract their power.
</p>
<p>Indeed, the power of Romanism to do evil is augment-
</p>
<p>ed by the fact that it has in it so much truth. This truth
</p>
<p>is, if we may so say, in a state of captivity to the Romish
</p>
<p>hierarchy, and is used by them to gain their own ends.
</p>
<p>They use it to give authority to their system.
</p>
<p>By means of it they fit up some rooms in the great Ba-
</p>
<p>bel in which holy men can dwell and worship God, though
</p>
<p>in captivity. Meantime the existence of such good men
</p>
<p>under the system is used to give it influence. They are
</p>
<p>as stool pigeons to draw others into the snare.
</p>
<p>It is a part of the policy of the system to introduce all
</p>
<p>manner of inconsistent or contradictory views for va-
</p>
<p>rious minds. Hence, though it contains many of the fun-
</p>
<p>damental doctrines of Protestantism for the pious, yet
</p>
<p>none the less does it introduce for other classes other doc-
</p>
<p>trines which neutralize or contradict them. And, if the
</p>
<p>contradictions are pointed out, it covers them up by the
</p>
<p>plea of mystery.
</p>
<p>But, passing from what it has in common with Protes-
</p>
<p>tantism, let us consider what is peculiarly its own.
</p>
<p>Let us, then, look at the system, stripping off its sancti-
</p>
<p>monious phraseology, and testing it by an impartial con-
</p>
<p>sideration of its tendencies and results.

<p>CHAPTER II.
</p>
<p>POPERY A RELIGION, A TRADING CORPORATION AND A
</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT.
</p>
<p>IF we examine carefully the system of Romanism, in its
</p>
<p>theory and in its practice, we shall discover a curious
</p>
<p>triple combination, composed of a religion, a trading cor-
</p>
<p>poration, and a government.
</p>
<p>POPERY A RELIGION.
</p>
<p>The great idea of the corporation as a religious body
</p>
<p>is, that it has an absolute and exclusive authority to con-
</p>
<p>fer the grace of God, as displayed in the pardon of sin
</p>
<p>and the gift of eternal life. This grace it dispenses
</p>
<p>through certain agents, who alone are empowered to con-
</p>
<p>fer it and whose grace alone is genuine. All other pre-
</p>
<p>tended grace is spurious and counterfeit.
</p>
<p>Again : this grace is communicated through various
</p>
<p>forms, or processes, called sacraments, and through the
</p>
<p>profession of a certain creed, and through confession to
</p>
<p>one of their agents, called a priest, who has full power
</p>
<p>from God, through them, to forgive sins, and to impose
</p>
<p>penances as the condition.
</p>
<p>So far the system has the aspect of a religion. If, now,
</p>
<p>all this were done freely, and not as a means of obtaining

</p>
<p>money, the aspect of a trading company would not be
</p>
<p>seen. But such is not the fact.
</p>
<p>POPERY A TRADING CORPORATION.
</p>
<p>In all ages this system has been used as a means of ac-
</p>
<p>cumulating immense sums of money in return for the grace
</p>
<p>of God, of which it has the entire monopoly. This grace
</p>
<p>reaches, not merely to this life, but to an indefinite period
</p>
<p>beyond this life, in which the soul is neither in heaven nor
</p>
<p>in hell, but somewhere between, in a place of torment
</p>
<p>called purgatory. Besides the common grace of God,
</p>
<p>this corporation has laid up an inexhaustible store of the
</p>
<p>merits of all saints beyond what was needed for their
</p>
<p>own salvation ; and of these merits, also, they have the
</p>
<p>entire monopoly. Thus, by masses, and the application of
</p>
<p>these merits, and by prayers for the dead, they can deliver
</p>
<p>souls from purgatory ; and for a reasonable compensation
</p>
<p>they are always ready to do it. This gives them great
</p>
<p>power at sick beds, and over the wills of dying men and
</p>
<p>women, and over the purses of living relatives and friends.
</p>
<p>They have, also, various other sources of profit from the
</p>
<p>living, in the form of indulgences for sin ; scapularies, as
</p>
<p>defences against all evils ; masses of every variety and
</p>
<p>for every purpose ; dispensations from fasts ; removals of
</p>
<p>impediments to marriage ; miraculous medals ; various de-
</p>
<p>fences against the devil ; grace through the images or rel-
</p>
<p>ics of patron saints, especially on their annual festivals ;
</p>
<p>and numerous other similar devices'. It will be found that
</p>
<p>all the peculiar doctrines and practices of Popery have a
</p>
<p>wonderful adaptation to produce immense pecuniary profit.

</p>
<p>ings. In like manner, the grace of relics is most abundant
</p>
<p>towards the most liberal contributors. One recent in-
</p>
<p>stance will cast light on this matter. The celebrated
</p>
<p>prelate, Arnold of Treves, and his priests, are said to have
</p>
<p>received one hundred thousand dollars in six months from
</p>
<p>offerings made in order to obtain a portion of the grace
</p>
<p>stored up in the holy coat. Eighty thousand medals of
</p>
<p>the Virgin, full of the same grace, were also sold, and also
</p>
<p>ribbons, bits of cloth, cotton, and silk which had touched
</p>
<p>the holy coat, and thus derived a portion of its salutary
</p>
<p>power. All the old rags in the neighborhood of Treves
</p>
<p>were thus sold for their weight in gold. The total value
</p>
<p>of this particular adventure is estimated at three hundred
</p>
<p>thousand dollars.
</p>
<p>It is to be understood that the Romish corporation has
</p>
<p>the monopoly of this department of gracious influence also,
</p>
<p>and that no bones, hair, skulls, chairs, coats, ribbons, medals,
</p>
<p>cloth, cotton, and silk are genuine except those which
</p>
<p>come from their manufactory. I have mentioned other
</p>
<p>important departments of traffic equally profitable, or
</p>
<p>even more so.
</p>
<p>Here, then, opens upon us the view of an immense com-
</p>
<p>merce carried on for ages, the statistics of which have
</p>
<p>never yet been reported. But it is well known that, at the
</p>
<p>time of the reformation, this corporation and their agents
</p>
<p>had gained possession of half, and sometimes of three
</p>
<p>quarters, of the property of the various states of Europe.
</p>
<p>Nor is there any question that, if the details were known,
</p>
<p>it would be found that the commerce of Tyre, of Carthage,
</p>
<p>of Venice, of the Hanse Towns, of the East India Compa-
</p>
<p>ny, and of all other trading companies whatever has been
</p>
<p>quite thrown into the shade by the traffic of this great
</p>
<p>corporation. Hence in .prophecy its downfall is repre-
</p>
<p>sented under the symbol of the ruin of an immense com-

<p>POPERY A RELIGION, A TRADING CORPORATION, ETC. 137
</p>
<p>POPERY A GOVERNMENT.
</p>
<p>Viewing this corporation as a government, the aspect
</p>
<p>of things is no less impressive. The head of the corpora-
</p>
<p>tion is both a spiritual and a temporal ruler. He claims
</p>
<p>to be monarch of all monarchs. His senate of cardinals
</p>
<p>and electors are princes. His bishops also are lords each
</p>
<p>in his diocese, but are still his vassals, bound to him by a
</p>
<p>feudal oath. To him also are bound the rulers of the
</p>
<p>Jesuits and of the various orders of monks and nuns, who
</p>
<p>are an all-pervading soldiery, sworn to do his will. To
</p>
<p>the bishops also are subjected the secular priests, and to
</p>
<p>them are subjected the people. Thus the whole system is
</p>
<p>one compact and all-pervading government, the rule of
</p>
<p>which is absolute obedience to the central power and its
</p>
<p>agents in regular subordination. It is an immense army
</p>
<p>under military discipline.

</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.
</p>
<p>OPEEATION AND EFFECTS OF THE SYSTEM.
</p>
<p>LET us now study the operation of this corporation on
</p>
<p>the mind. And, first of all, it is evident that in religious
</p>
<p>matters it puts itself in God's place. God could, no doubt,
</p>
<p>if he pleased, reveal himself and impart grace to individ-
</p>
<p>uals out of this corporation ; but he will not. He has de-
</p>
<p>termined not to act except through this visible corpora-
</p>
<p>tion. No one can have any thing to do with him but
</p>
<p>through them. All the world outside of them is empty
</p>
<p>of divine grace. There is no sunshine there. All is dark
</p>
<p>as hell ; all is under the despotism of the devil. God
</p>
<p>comes to man only as he has stored up in them his grace.
</p>
<p>Of that grace they have inexhaustible quantities. They,
</p>
<p>and they only, are the great head quarters of supply.
</p>
<p>Again : as they are infallible, and as God has subjected
</p>
<p>all men to them and put all grace into their hands, all
</p>
<p>men are bound to be their subjects and also their cus-
</p>
<p>tomers. To believe any others, or obey any others, or
</p>
<p>buy the grace of God of any others, is treason.
</p>
<p>Again : as they are infallible, so they aim, as far as
</p>
<p>possible, to be omniscient and omnipresent. This they
</p>
<p>effect by their agents who hear confessions. To them
</p>
<p>every act, motive, feeling, thought, and plan must be dis-
</p>
<p>closed, or no pardon of sins can be obtained ; for they

</p>
<p>cannot judge of sins unless they know all the circum-
</p>
<p>stances of alleviation or aggravation.
</p>
<p>Again : not only are the corporation to be regarded as
</p>
<p>infallible, but also their agents to whom confession is
</p>
<p>made are to be treated as infallible ; for, practically, the
</p>
<p>people are not allowed to know what the corporation or
</p>
<p>God teaches or demands by private judgment, but solely
</p>
<p>through the priests. It comes to this, then, in practice,
</p>
<p>that to each one his or her priest is as God, and hears
</p>
<p>confessions and absolves as God ; and so their councils and
</p>
<p>doctors teach. Each priest, then, is virtually an exten-
</p>
<p>sion of the great divine, infallible, central corporation.
</p>
<p>Thus the great central corporation branches out into
</p>
<p>agencies and sub-agencies all over the world, through
</p>
<p>which it teaches, governs, and trades.
</p>
<p>It thus comes- to pass that though theoretically the
</p>
<p>priest is not infallible, but only the great corporation, so
</p>
<p>that they are not responsible for his statements, yet in
</p>
<p>practice it is the priest who alone knows what the church,
</p>
<p>who is infallible and as God, teaches, and he therefore is
</p>
<p>practically infallible and as God ; and it is practical here-
</p>
<p>sy or treason, as a general fact, not so to regard him.
</p>
<p>GRAND PECULIARITY.
</p>
<p>"We now come to a grand peculiarity of the system,
</p>
<p>upon which its working power entirely depends. To the
</p>
<p>masses it materializes and perverts all ideas of heaven
</p>
<p>and hell ; it gives false and fanatical conceptions of God
</p>
<p>as regarding this corporation more than real and genuine
</p>
<p>holiness ; it fills the mind with superstitious fears, and

</p>
<p>then concentrates all these forces, from the first dawn of

</p>
<p>reason, to break down all energy or courage to think or
</p>
<p>to reason from the Bible or from any other source against
</p>
<p>their authority or decisions. Even to doubt is heresy ; it
</p>
<p>is infidelity. It thus aims by the whole power of educa-
</p>
<p>tion thoroughly to cut the sinews of reason and of reason-
</p>
<p>ing, and to establish a habit-of blind and implicit belief.
</p>
<p>In this they have most incredible success.
</p>
<p>Few have ever adequately considered the wide range
</p>
<p>of this operation. We know God as he is by love. Ev-
</p>
<p>ery one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God.
</p>
<p>The elements of heaven are found in the perfection of
</p>
<p>love and of communion with God.
</p>
<p>But the miseries of hell are but the opposite of the joys
</p>
<p>of heaven ; they are the full development of malignant
</p>
<p>passions and a sense of the just displeasure of God.
</p>
<p>There is no need of literal penal fires ; nor does the Bible
</p>
<p>teach their existence.
</p>
<p>But the moment that God is conceived of as the partial
</p>
<p>God of a corporation for the most part grossly immoral,
</p>
<p>and holy men out of that church are consigned to literal
</p>
<p>fire, no true ideas of God, heaven, or hell remain. He is
</p>
<p>conceived of as an infinite, almighty, malignant demon.
</p>
<p>Malignity and revenge are sanctified as zeal for him. Ar-
</p>
<p>bitrary and fanatical terrors are multiplied. They pen-
</p>
<p>etrate the youthful mind and freeze it with horror at the
</p>
<p>thought of doubting the word of a corporation outside
</p>
<p>of which he has consigned all to perdition. From the
</p>
<p>effects of such training few ever recover.
</p>
<p>Such is the corporation and such its mode of opera-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>Let us next consider its tendencies and effects.
</p>
<p>As Protestants, we are of course regarded as heretics.

</p>
<p>Let us, then, first consider its aspects towards us.
</p>
<p>OPEBATION AND EFFECTS OF THE SYSTEM. 141
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF HERETICS.
</p>
<p>First, then, it tends to make heresy the greatest of all
</p>
<p>crimes, and especially the heresy of doubting or denying
</p>
<p>the divine authority and the infallibility of the corpora-
</p>
<p>tion.
</p>
<p>The reason of this is plain. In the belief of this divine
</p>
<p>authority and infallibility lies the whole working power
</p>
<p>of the system in all its aspects religious, pecuniary, and
</p>
<p>political. It is the essential, all-pervading element of its
</p>
<p>vitality. Therefore it is only the natural instinct of self-
</p>
<p>defence to consider the act of calling in question its di-
</p>
<p>vine authority or infallibility the greatest of crimes. To
</p>
<p>believe and act against its authority, its decisions, and its
</p>
<p>will, is the great, the only, unpardonable sin. It is called
</p>
<p>HERESY in the phraseology of theologians. Its real and
</p>
<p>more intelligible name is, or ought to be, TREASON ; for this
</p>
<p>is what they mean by it. It is resistance to their author-
</p>
<p>ity, their power, their will, their law. Even if you are
</p>
<p>not actually promulgating error, yet, if you claim the
</p>
<p>right to judge of them or of their decisions by the Bible
</p>
<p>or by reason, you are guilty of the very essence of trea-
</p>
<p>son. It was for this, and this alone, that they burned
</p>
<p>John Huss.
</p>
<p>Again : on their premises, the destruction of heretics is
</p>
<p>the natural and consistent development of the system.
</p>
<p>For those who are not infallible to destroy dissentients is
</p>
<p>illogical and inconsistent. But if such a corporation is a
</p>
<p>true and genuine theocracy, and knows it, and is infallible
</p>
<p>in all its decisions, if they are, in fact, God upon earth,
</p>
<p>then they regard themselves as standing on genuine Old
</p>
<p>Testament ground, and, in slaughtering heretics, as simply

</p>
<p>imitating Elijah in his slaughter of the priests of Baal,
</p>
<p>142 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>or Joshua in his slaughter of the idolatrous Canaanites at
</p>
<p>the command of God.
</p>
<p>So, indeed, those who have been brought up thoroughly
</p>
<p>to believe the system have always looked at the matter.
</p>
<p>Believing this corporation to be a true theocracy, involv-
</p>
<p>ing all the interests of Grod and of man on earth, rebel-
</p>
<p>lion against it and efforts to destroy its authority they
</p>
<p>have regarded as the greatest of crimes. Hence we can
</p>
<p>understand why, though the Spaniards pity other criminals
</p>
<p>when executed, they exult and manifest peculiar joy at the
</p>
<p>burning of heretics ; which is well known to be the fact.
</p>
<p>Hence, also, the religious services on the occasion of the
</p>
<p>massacre of St. Bartholomew were no more than the
</p>
<p>logical results of the system.
</p>
<p>Beyond all doubt this is the only real logical, consistent
</p>
<p>Roman Catholic view. On no other ground can the deeds
</p>
<p>of that system be defended ; and there is now; as we have
</p>
<p>seen, a general tendency to take this ground and avow its
</p>
<p>consequences, and to declare that as soon as they gain the
</p>
<p>power they shall carry out these principles again.
</p>
<p>On this ground Mr. Brownson denies that the Romish
</p>
<p>church ever has persecuted : she has but exercised just
</p>
<p>authority in punishing those who were guilty of treason.
</p>
<p>TREATMENT OF THE BIBLE AND OF HISTORY.
</p>
<p>But again : it follows that if in fact this corporation has
</p>
<p>no basis in the Bible, nor in history, but is founded on im-
</p>
<p>posture and forgery, it of course must create in the man-
</p>
<p>agers of the corporation a peculiar and an intense hatred
</p>
<p>of the Bible and of history. Viewed either as a religion,
</p>
<p>a trading corporation, or a government, it would exert

</p>
<p>and of the great volume of history. How much more
</p>
<p>when the interests of three such systems combined in one
</p>
<p>are in peril!
</p>
<p>It is natural that the inhabitants of an immense palace
</p>
<p>should regard with horror and indignation all efforts to
</p>
<p>cast fire into it and consume it. Yet the Bible and his-
</p>
<p>tory are merely the fire of God. Let them be fully de-
</p>
<p>veloped, and this whole fabric is consumed. Of course
</p>
<p>the most intense energies of this whole mighty corpora-
</p>
<p>tion will be put forth to avert these results.
</p>
<p>The doctrine of pious frauds, at its first development,
</p>
<p>was feeble and its aspect plausible ; but out of it grew
</p>
<p>the whole Papal system. And now, at last, all kinds of
</p>
<p>fraud, pious and impious, are needed in its defence, and
</p>
<p>must be and will be employed with the most intense en-
</p>
<p>ergy. "We need not wonder that the system sanctions
</p>
<p>them. It could not exist a day without them.
</p>
<p>EFFECTS ON LIBERTY.
</p>
<p>Once more : this system is, of necessity, one immense
</p>
<p>conspiracy, designed to destroy the very roots of all intel-
</p>
<p>lectual, civil, and religious liberty. This is essential in
</p>
<p>order to sustain it. This is involved in the decision of
</p>
<p>the church, " that he who only doubts concerning the faith,
</p>
<p>is to be reputed an infidel." This maxim, applied from
</p>
<p>the first development of the intellectual powers of a child,
</p>
<p>and by every process of parental, priestly, and ecclesias-
</p>
<p>tical influence, and by every terror that superstition can
</p>
<p>summon up, paralyzes and cripples the minds of thorough-
</p>

</p>
<p>conceive. This principle pervades the system with intense
</p>
<p>144 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>power, and especially all Romish educational processes.
</p>
<p>A habit of free and independent thought is fatal to their
</p>
<p>church. Hence the hatred of the ecclesiastics of Rome
</p>
<p>against our system of free schools, our histories, and our
</p>
<p>Bibles. If she would maintain herself she must have a
</p>
<p>system of education entirely under her control, so that she
</p>
<p>may still, as heretofore, cripple and paralyze the mind
</p>
<p>from its first to its last educational processes. This is
</p>
<p>what she means to have.
</p>
<p>How can a community thus educated be free? Can
</p>
<p>any outward forms of government give freedom to a na-
</p>
<p>tion the minds of whose children are thus paralyzed and
</p>
<p>crippled from the dawn of life ? This effect of Romanism
</p>
<p>was seen and lamented in France at the time of the last
</p>
<p>revolution. One of her leading statesmen declared that
</p>
<p>she could not follow the example of America in sustain-
</p>
<p>ing popular institutions, and assigned the influence of
</p>
<p>Papal education as the reason.
</p>
<p>On this ground Pierce Connelly, once a Romish priest,
</p>
<p>eloquently says, in his letter to Lord Shrewsbury assign-
</p>
<p>ing his reasons for abjuring allegiance to the see of
</p>
<p>Rome,
</p>
<p>" It is not civil liberty that is the first want of the con-
</p>
<p>tinent of Europe or of the Spanish republics of America.
</p>
<p>The want is, the education necessary for men to be free,
</p>
<p>the perception of what 'is liberty ; the want is, EMANCI-
</p>
<p>PATION FROM A PSEUDO-DIVINE JURISDICTION UPON EARTH.
</p>
<p>This is the want that makes the darkness of their future,
</p>
<p>as of their present and their past. Rome weighs upon
</p>
<p>her victims like an eternal nightmare. Who was more
</p>
<p>impatient of the oppression than Venice ? But was her
</p>
<p>proudest patrician ever free ? Nay, is Prussia, reduced to
</p>
<p>a semi-Papal province by concordat, is Prussia or any

<p>OPERATION AND EFFECTS OF THE SYSTEM. 145
</p>
<p>EFFECTS OX NATIONAL PROSPERITY.
</p>
<p>Once more : the immense extortions of the system, as
</p>
<p>well as its system of holidays, absorbing in idleness a
</p>
<p>large portion of the time of the laboring classes, have
</p>
<p>tended in all ages, and still tend, to impoverish the na-
</p>
<p>tions over -which it holds sway. It is notorious that
</p>
<p>kings and people in the most Catholic ages have groaned
</p>
<p>most bitterly by reason of its various extortions, and have
</p>
<p>been by them at last aroused to resistance. Such feelings
</p>
<p>indeed, in part, caused the reformation. Hence the mis
</p>
<p>erable condition of Italy, and especially of the population
</p>
<p>of the Papal States.
</p>
<p>In our own country, one of the priests has bitterly cursed
</p>
<p>savings banks. The reason is plain. The church prefers
</p>
<p>to extort the savings of the poor laborers of this country
</p>
<p>for her own purposes rather than to have them deposited
</p>
<p>for their earners in savings banks. So, also, she is deter-
</p>
<p>mined to own all their church property. Moreover, be-
</p>
<p>cause the system is hostile to all kinds of mental liberty,
</p>
<p>it is of necessity hostile to all inventive power, and to all
</p>
<p>free development of the laws of nature and of society,
</p>
<p>and to "all social progress. This is self-evident ; for all
</p>
<p>truth belongs to one great system ; and true freedom to in-
</p>
<p>vestigate one part leads to true freedom to investigate
</p>
<p>another. The only safe course is to arrest the process,
</p>
<p>as when the Inquisition compelled Galileo to recant the
</p>
<p>true theory of the motion of the earth.
</p>
<p>Under such influences true social progress is impossible.
</p>
<p>There will be no development of thrift, industry, energy,
</p>
<p>enterprise, invention, even as we see to be the case in all
</p>
<p>parts of Roman Catholic Ireland.
</p>

<p>to give all the credit that he can to Rome before the ref-
</p>
<p>ormation. His judgment, therefore, is the more impartial
</p>
<p>as to what she is now. Speaking of the time since the ref-
</p>
<p>ormation, he says,
</p>
<p>" To stunt the growth of the human mind has been her
</p>
<p>chief object. Throughout Christendom, whatever advance
</p>
<p>has been made in knowledge, in freedom, in wealth, and in
</p>
<p>the arts of life, has been made in spite of her, and has every
</p>
<p>where been in inverse proportion to her power. The love-
</p>
<p>liest and most fertile provinces of Europe have, under her
</p>
<p>rule, been sunk in poverty, in political servitude, and in
</p>
<p>intellectual torpor ; while Protestant countries, once pro-
</p>
<p>verbial for sterility and barbarism, have been turned, by
</p>
<p>skill and industry, in^o gardens, and can boast of a long
</p>
<p>list of heroes and statesmen, philosophers and poets.
</p>
<p>Whoever, knowing what Italy and Scotland naturally are,
</p>
<p>and what, four hundred years ago, they actually were,
</p>
<p>shall now compare the country round Rome with the coun-
</p>
<p>try round Edinburgh, will be able to form some judgment
</p>
<p>as to the tendency of Papal domination. The descent of
</p>
<p>Spain, once the first among monarchies, to the lowest
</p>
<p>depths of degradation, the elevation of Holland, in spite
</p>
<p>of many natural disadvantages, to a position' such as no
</p>
<p>commonwealth so small has ever reached, teach the same
</p>
<p>lesson. Whoever passes, in Germany, from a Roman
</p>
<p>Catholic to a Protestant principality, in Switzerland from
</p>
<p>a Roman Catholic to a Protestant canton, in Ireland from
</p>
<p>a Roman Catholic to a Protestant county, finds that he has
</p>
<p>passed from a lower to a higher grade of civilization. On
</p>
<p>the other side of the Atlantic the same law prevails. The
</p>
<p>Protestants of the United States have left far behind them

<p>the Roman Catholics of Mexico, Peru, and Brazil. The

<p>OPEKATION AND EFFECTS OF THE SYSTEM. 147
</p>
<p>ROME THE EXEMY OF MAN.
</p>
<p>From this general survey it is obvious that the Romish
</p>
<p>church is the enemy of man in all aspects religious, po-
</p>
<p>litical, and social. Nor would it seem possible to add
</p>
<p>any thing to the magnitude and enormity of her guilt.
</p>
<p>And yet, thus far, we have hardly begun to penetrate the
</p>
<p>depths of her malignant influence. It is not until we have
</p>
<p>understood the moral influence of her system upon her
</p>
<p>priesthood, and through them upon all departments of re-
</p>
<p>ligion and of social life, that we can thoroughly under-
</p>
<p>stand the blasting and desolating power of Romanism.
</p>
<p>I refer in particular to the influence of the celibacy of
</p>
<p>the clergy, and of the confessional in connection with it.
</p>
<p>Rome here has one advantage over Protestants. The
</p>
<p>facts of her history in these respects are so outrageous
</p>
<p>that they cannot, with any regard to decency, be fully
</p>
<p>stated. Moreover they are so atrocious that, until we
</p>
<p>see the law and the philosophy of their origin, they seem
</p>
<p>incredible. In addition, it is painful to contemplate such
</p>
<p>disgusting enormities and crimes.
</p>
<p>I shall not try to deprive Romanism of her advantages
</p>
<p>of this sort. I shall not pollute the public mind by a full
</p>
<p>disclosure of the truth with respect to her abominations.
</p>
<p>These are the things of which an apostle says it is a shame
</p>
<p>even to speak.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, fidelity to God, and to our country, and
</p>
<p>to humanity forbids that this topic be passed over. It is
</p>
<p>proper, at least, to state general principles and some

<p>leading facts.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV.
</p>
<p>THE CELIBACY OF THE CLERGY. >
</p>
<p>IT is plain that to administer a system like Romanism
</p>
<p>requires a very peculiar class of men, and an intense
</p>
<p>power of combination, and concentration, and military
</p>
<p>discipline.
</p>
<p>Men are needed bound to the pope more powerfully
</p>
<p>than to any local community ; men who will not shrink
</p>
<p>from any needed hypocrisy, falsehood, deception, or per-
</p>
<p>fidy ; men who will be hardened and fanatical enough to
</p>
<p>preside over and conduct the extremest kinds of torture
</p>
<p>with a firmness of nerve which no pity can affect, and no
</p>
<p>weakness turn back from the infliction of torment upon
</p>
<p>torment.
</p>
<p>In short, men are needed habituated to speak lies, in hy-
</p>
<p>pocrisy, and having consciences seared as with a hot iron
</p>
<p>men who are able, with brazen face, to claim all manner
</p>
<p>of sanctity whilst performing all kinds of diabolical deeds.
</p>
<p>Men are needed, fanatical, degraded, cruel, immitigable,
</p>
<p>and unprincipled, to carry out such a system.
</p>
<p>To produce concentration, celibacy is used. It cuts off
</p>
<p>the clergy from all ties of family or home, and leaves them
</p>
<p>to the full power of the great centre at Rome.
</p>
<p>To fix the despotism on the people, the confessional is
</p>
<p>used ; and by both of these together the priest is de-
</p>
<p>graded, polluted, and defiled, and at the same time ren-

</p>
<p>dered a hardened and cruel hypocrite and villain, fit for
</p>
<p>any deed of infamy which the system demands. I do not
</p>
<p>mean to include every priest in this statement, but only to
</p>
<p>develop the general law and tendency of the system.
</p>
<p>If we would thoroughly understand the full malignity,
</p>
<p>the diabolical power, and intensity of the all-pervading
</p>
<p>poison of Romanism, let the full import of this statement
</p>
<p>be thoroughly understood. It is needless to make any
</p>
<p>remarks on the importance of the clerical body under any
</p>
<p>form of Christianity. They are the administrators of the
</p>
<p>whole system ; they are diffused throughout the commu-
</p>
<p>nity ; they act upon every interest of life. The family,
</p>
<p>the school, the church are constantly under their influence.
</p>
<p>In the sacred solemnities of marriage they officiate ; in the
</p>
<p>joys of parents over a newborn child they sympathize ; in
</p>
<p>the hour of sickness, by the bed of death, they are present
</p>
<p>to administer spiritual instruction ; and in the hour of af-
</p>
<p>fliction and bereavement it is theirs to offer the consola-
</p>
<p>tions of the gospel. As the blood circulates through the
</p>
<p>whole body, so does their influence penetrate and pervade
</p>
<p>every part of the body politic.
</p>
<p>What, then, can be more evident than that whatever
</p>
<p>corrupts and degrades the clergy extends its malign in-
</p>
<p>fluence throughout the whole community ? Whatever sanc-
</p>
<p>tifies and elevates them, will diffuse with equal power
</p>
<p>blessings of every kind.
</p>
<p>It is, then, enough to condemn Romanism to utter det-
</p>
<p>estation, as the enemy of both God and man, that it is a
</p>
<p>system framed with satanic skill and power to corrupt and
</p>
<p>to debase the clergy, and render them ineffably vile, and
</p>
<p>hardened, and malignant.
</p>
<p>If to any this language shall seem unwarrantably strong,
</p>
<p>let such consider the two following facts :
</p>
<p>By usurped authority, it undertakes to suspend, in all its

<p>150 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>clergy, the action of a great law of nature, ordained by
</p>
<p>God for the welfare of man a law, too, which, from the
</p>
<p>very nature of the case, acts with greater and more con-
</p>
<p>stant power than any other that can be named. Love is
</p>
<p>strong as death mightier than the grave. The coals
</p>
<p>thereof are coals of fire, that hath a most vehement flame.
</p>
<p>Many waters cannot quench love ; neither can the floods
</p>
<p>drown it. If a man would give all the substance of his
</p>
<p>house for love, it would be utterly contemned.
</p>
<p>It is not without reason that God made man capable of
</p>
<p>this powerful affection. The family is a little model of
</p>
<p>the universal system under God and the church ; and the
</p>
<p>love on which it is based is an emblem of the highest love
</p>
<p>of the universe even that which exists between God
</p>
<p>and the redeemed.
</p>
<p>Though God has thus associated this love with all that
</p>
<p>is holy ; though he has pronounced marriage honorable in
</p>
<p>all, and the bed undefiled ; though he has clearly intimated
</p>
<p>his will that the clergy should have wives and rule their
</p>
<p>families well, yet the corporation of Rome dares to stig-
</p>
<p>matize as unholy what God has thus honored, and has
</p>
<p>prohibited marriage to all her clergy, from the highest to
</p>
<p>the lowest, on the ground that thus they can attain a
</p>
<p>higher degree of sanctity. This is the first great fact to
</p>
<p>be considered.
</p>
<p>THE CONFESSIONAL.
</p>
<p>The second great fact is this that these unhappy men,
</p>
<p>thus condemned through life to contend with those pow-
</p>
<p>erful impulses which God has implanted in their breasts,
</p>
<p>are not allowed to retire from temptation and call off
</p>
<p>their minds from forbidden thoughts, but are deliberately,

<p>remorselessly, and constantly thrust into the very centre
</p>
<p>THE CELIBACY OP THE CLERGY. 151
</p>
<p>of the fiery furnace of temptation. This is done by requir-
</p>
<p>ing them to "hear the confessions of all their flock, in which,
</p>
<p>of course, are included those of females of all ages, and on
</p>
<p>all the points that are involved in a thorough confession.
</p>
<p>Any one who knows what this implies will not need to
</p>
<p>hear any thing more. On topics upon which in common
</p>
<p>life no refined person pretends to speak, they are required
</p>
<p>by their theological teachers and text books to make the
</p>
<p>most minute examinations as to the thoughts, imagina-
</p>
<p>tions, desires, and acts of every female who comes to the
</p>
<p>confessional. Not one Protestant in a thousand has any
</p>
<p>idea what questions are proposed in the schedules of ex-
</p>
<p>amination set forth in their most authoritative text books.
</p>
<p>Decency forbids their utterance.
</p>
<p>Now, with regard to this arrangement, it may be truly
</p>
<p>said that satanic ingenuity could not devise a system
</p>
<p>better adapted to corrupt and debase the clerical body as
</p>
<p>a mass. It is no more certain that water will run down
</p>
<p>hill than it is that they will not resist the temptations to
</p>
<p>which they are exposed. They will be corrupted and
</p>
<p>will become corrupters.
</p>
<p>And yet they are bound to profess and to claim for
</p>
<p>themselves and for their church great and exclusive holi-
</p>
<p>ness. The Protestant clergy, who are blessed of God in
</p>
<p>lawful marriage, they are bound to denounce as unclean.
</p>
<p>At the same time they are distinctly conscious that the
</p>
<p>only difference in the case is, that against solemn vows,
</p>
<p>and without the blessing of God, and as seducers and cor-
</p>
<p>rupters, they seek for and obtain that which the others
</p>
<p>enjoy according to the divine and hallowed ordinance of
</p>
<p>God.
</p>
<p>Licentiousness always hardens and degrades the charac-
</p>
<p>ter in any circumstances ; but in circumstances like these,

</p>
<p>how unspeakably much more ! He who can carry on the
</p>
<p>152 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>lying involved in such a course is trained for any and
</p>
<p>all other lying. He who is debased and hardened by
</p>
<p>such a process is fitted for any and all other atrocious
</p>
<p>deeds. That such is the result of the system, there is,
</p>
<p>alas ! evidence beyond the power of full utterance. Some
</p>
<p>of it, however, shall be presented.
</p>
<p>VAST SOCIAL EVILS.
</p>
<p>But, before presenting this evidence, we need to take
</p>
<p>another view of the case in order to understand the full
</p>
<p>extent of the evil. We need to remember that the celi-
</p>
<p>bacy of the clergy is founded on the heathenish notion
</p>
<p>which early corrupted the Christian church that the
</p>
<p>material system which God has created in so much wis-
</p>
<p>dom and benevolence is malignant in its tendencies, and
</p>
<p>is the chief, if not the only, cause of sin. Of course, to
</p>
<p>be connected with a material body is, on these principles,
</p>
<p>a great calamity and the chief source of depravity ; and
</p>
<p>the great idea in the cultivation of holiness is to mortify
</p>
<p>the body and refuse to indulge its appetites.
</p>
<p>In particular, even the well-regulated gratification of
</p>
<p>that most honorable and powerful affection upon which
</p>
<p>God designed the marriage union and the family state to
</p>
<p>rest is dishonored and degraded, as utterly inconsistent
</p>
<p>with the highest attainments in holiness. Whoever would
</p>
<p>become eminently holy, whether man or woman, must first
</p>
<p>of all abjure marriage and take the vow of perpetual
</p>
<p>celibacy and chastity.
</p>
<p>Thus, at the very outset, an all-pervading injury is in-
</p>
<p>flicted on the great mass of mankind, who must and will
</p>
<p>live in the married state, by consigning them to a state

<p>of necessary uncleanness and relative moral degradation.
</p>
<p>THE CELIBACY OP THE CLERGY. 153
</p>
<p>None of them can ever become eminently holy. That
</p>
<p>blessed eminence is reserved for unmarried priests and
</p>
<p>nuns.
</p>
<p>No greater calamity can befall a community than
</p>
<p>to have their fundamental ideas of true religion thus
</p>
<p>darkened and confused. It lays the foundation for their
</p>
<p>utter delusion in their religious experience as a whole, for
</p>
<p>a low standard of morals, and for their subjugation to a
</p>
<p>system which excludes the intelligent action of the mind
</p>
<p>in view of truth, and substitutes for it confession to a priest,
</p>
<p>and penances, and fasts, and sacraments, whose efficacy de-
</p>
<p>pends solely upon the priesthood. As thus all just ideas
</p>
<p>of religion as a rational and sanctified state of the affec-
</p>
<p>tions and will, acting itself out in a holy life, are exploded,
</p>
<p>we need not wonder that in place of it comes a religion
</p>
<p>of heartless works, and forms, and shows, and imaginative
</p>
<p>excitements.
</p>
<p>Holiness no longer comes through a knowledge of God
</p>
<p>and his law, producing a true sense of sin and leading to
</p>
<p>repentance and faith in Christ ; it comes through a cer-
</p>
<p>tain mysterious grace, through baptism, the Lord's supper,
</p>
<p>and other sacraments, of which the clergy have the entire
</p>
<p>monopoly ; and, as there is no discriminating standard
</p>
<p>of holiness, all kinds of sympathetic and imaginative ex-
</p>
<p>citements are mistaken for it. The natural affections, the
</p>
<p>excitement of music, and pictures, and images, all is
</p>
<p>religion.
</p>
<p>Thus the false principles from which the celibacy of the
</p>
<p>clergy originates, like a malignant poison, pervade the
</p>
<p>whole system, and blast and destroy true religion at its
</p>
<p>very roots, and introduce in its place a system of blind
</p>
<p>delusion and of bondage.

</p>
<p>154 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>It is folly to suppose that God will interpose by special
</p>
<p>grace to prevent a system based on a fundamental vio-
</p>
<p>lation of his great laws from working out its natural
</p>
<p>results. In fact he has not interposed ; and history testi-
</p>
<p>fies in all ages, and by an inconceivable amount of evi-
</p>
<p>dence, that it has wrought out its legitimate results,
</p>
<p>especially in the deep corruption and fatal degradation of
</p>
<p>the clergy, and, through them, of the community.
</p>
<p>Well has the word of God stigmatized this whole theory
</p>
<p>as a " doctrine of devils," introduced by the great apos-
</p>
<p>tasy. Like an all-pervading pestilence, it smites with
</p>
<p>fatal malignity all the dearest interests of society ; for
</p>
<p>it not only thus debases the clergy, but also consigns to
</p>
<p>necessary degradation and bondage all the masses of
</p>
<p>society, confusing and confounding all ideas of the very
</p>
<p>nature of holiness itself.
</p>
<p>Overlooking the fundamental work of eradicating the
</p>
<p>great roots of sin, selfishness, pride, envy, and ambition,
</p>
<p>and thus leaving the most malignant passions to reign in
</p>
<p>the heart, it makes holiness in its highest forms to consist
</p>
<p>in a vain and fruitless conflict with those appetites which
</p>
<p>God has implanted in man's nature, which can never be
</p>
<p>overcome or exterminated, and the gratification of which

</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.
</p>
<p>REASONS FOE, A THOROUGH CONSIDERATION OF THIS
</p>
<p>PART OF THE SUBJECT.
</p>
<p>THERE are three reasons why this part of the system
</p>
<p>should be wisely and thoroughly considered. First : be-
</p>
<p>cause the Romish corporation, claiming to be the only holy
</p>
<p>and divinely authorized church, propose to extend it
</p>
<p>throughout this land and once more to subject the people
</p>
<p>to it as of old. Again : because it is essential to the per-
</p>
<p>manence and power of the Romish corporation. And
</p>
<p>again : because on this point Romanism has so fully de-
</p>
<p>veloped its tendencies and results in history that there are
</p>
<p>ample materials for a full and perfect judgment.
</p>
<p>It is plain that the Romanists contemplate the exten-
</p>
<p>sion of the celibacy of the clergy, and of monks, and Jes-
</p>
<p>uits, and nuns, throughout this country, from their avowals
</p>
<p>and their proceedings. They would subject us to such a
</p>
<p>system as France, and Spain, and Italy, and Austria have
</p>
<p>known and still know by a sad experience. "We ought,
</p>
<p>therefore, to know what that experience was and is. We
</p>
<p>ought also to know what was the state of things in Europe
</p>
<p>at large before the reformation, that we may see what the
</p>
<p>system was when not counteracted by Protestantism. God,
</p>
<p>by an experience of long centuries, has given to us ample
</p>
<p>stores of knowledge on the subject, of which we ought to
</p>
<p>avail ourselves ; for if there is a subject on which the

<p>156 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>whole world ought to feel with a holy, God-inspired, all-
</p>
<p>pervading, fiery energy, it is this. In fact it is at this
</p>
<p>time calling up in Europe the attention of even Romish
</p>
<p>communities as well as of Protestants. On this point the
</p>
<p>Eclectic Review says,
</p>
<p>" The great movement at present going on in Germany
</p>
<p>is a sufficient awakener. What has stirred like a tempest
</p>
<p>the whole ocean of Catholic life over almost every district
</p>
<p>of that great nation? The horrors resulting from the
</p>
<p>celibacy of the clergy, against which they have long pe-
</p>
<p>titioned the pope in vain.
</p>
<p>" The scandal to public morals and to private manners
</p>
<p>every where occasioned by the celibacy of the clergy, and
</p>
<p>the horrors resulting from that diabolical institution, have
</p>
<p>been of such a nature as completely to open the eyes of
</p>
<p>the most simple and stupid, and to occasion loud demands
</p>
<p>for its removal. According to German policy, every
</p>
<p>means has been used to suppress the knowledge of the ter-
</p>
<p>rible revelations which from time to time were taking
</p>
<p>place. The press was securely prevented by the censor
</p>
<p>from ever alluding to them ; the police hushed all possible
</p>
<p>discussion regarding them. Yet, spite of all this, such

<p>bloody and tragic facts have oozed through the thick walls

<p>and the crimes to which they gave origin, and in which
</p>
<p>the clergy often figured most mischievously for the inter-
</p>
<p>ests of religion. In Austria the resort to these shrines is
</p>
<p>still enormous. In the month of September alone the
</p>
<p>visitants to that of Maria Taferl, near Linz, often amount
</p>
<p>to one hundred and thirty thousand ; and all summer the
</p>
<p>people are streamiug from Vienna and numberless other
</p>
<p>places to that of the Black Virgin at Mariazell, in Styria."
</p>
<p>But, notwithstanding such things and even worse have
</p>
<p>been known to the Romish corporation, they are deter-
</p>
<p>mined to cling to the system with a death grasp ; for by
</p>
<p>it the clergy are detached from local attachments and cen-
</p>
<p>tralized around the Pope of Rome. The question of abol-
</p>
<p>ishing clerical celibacy was called up by the reformation ;
</p>
<p>it was earnestly argued in the council of Trent. Leading
</p>
<p>Catholic sovereigns urged the measure ; but Papal policy
</p>
<p>resisted and prevailed.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, such is the history of the past on this sub-
</p>
<p>ject that injured and insulted humanity every where ought
</p>
<p>to be aroused and animated by God till the whole system
</p>
<p>shall be consumed with avenging fire. On this point the

<p>, same reviewer says,
</p>
<p>" The governments of the most Catholic states are com-
</p>
<p>pelled to curb that license which the court of Rome allows,
</p>
<p>and to put down those atrocities which have received the
</p>
<p>patronage and the blessings of the most celebrated pon-
</p>
<p>tiffs. The very clergy themselves writhe and groan under
</p>
<p>the bondage into which the decree of Gregory VII. has
</p>
<p>thrown them a decree which has condemned them to a
</p>
<p>living death, and made them, where they should be the
</p>
<p>fountains of holiness, the most prolific fountains of crime
</p>
<p>and scandal. In vain they have implored the pope to

<p>reconsider and abolish this unnatural decree ; its abolition

</p>
<p>158 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>mystery of iniquity, the purgatory, and lonely wretched-
</p>
<p>ness of a priest's life are depicted with a feeling that makes
</p>
<p>you shrink with horror from the contemplation. It is this
</p>
<p>terrible reality, acting alike on priests and people in
</p>
<p>Catholic countries, making the priest's life a true misery,
</p>
<p>converting him into a spy and a tool, compelling him who
</p>
<p>has vowed before God to proclaim the truth into a studied
</p>
<p>and inevitable supporter of the most infamous frauds, a
</p>
<p>cor-rupter of the minds of the young, and a tyrant where
</p>
<p>he should be the friend, it is because the confessional has
</p>
<p>become the soul trap of Satan and the well of all spiritual pol-
</p>
<p>lutions that the popular mind has revolted from the system
</p>
<p>throughout Germany, and will revolt from it, finally, every
</p>
<p>where. In England we have had these horrors removed
</p>
<p>from our observation ; and therefore Catholicism is toler-
</p>
<p>able and even piquant to the imagination. Let M. Mi-
</p>
<p>chelet say what is in France."
</p>
<p>The concluding remarks of the Eclectic reviewer are ap-
</p>
<p>plicable to this country. Popery here is not seen in its true
</p>
<p>character and full development, and therefore to some it
</p>
<p>seems tolerable ; and efforts have been made to render it
</p>
<p>piquant to the imagination. Bishop Kenrick has, with
</p>
<p>great audacity, undertaken this work. He has under-
</p>
<p>taken, not only to vindicate the system, but to prove that
</p>
<p>the influence of the confessional tends, " like a river of
</p>
<p>pure water from the temple of God, to wash away all the
</p>
<p>pollutions of society."
</p>
<p>It is therefore essential that every true American should
</p>
<p>be well informed on this great and momentous theme, af-
</p>
<p>fecting as it does the morals and the whole well being of
</p>
<p>coming ages. In vain does Bishop Kenrick say that the
</p>
<p>system works well hei'e. A young tiger may seem, when
</p>
<p>in his infancy, as harmless as a kitten ; but it is a tiger
</p>
<p>still. I do not believe in the purity of the system here.

<p>But if it were so, what then? What if, when not full

</p>
<p>not reveal itself as it always has in Romanized countries?
</p>
<p>Still, if ever it should gain the ascendency in this com-
</p>
<p>munity, its effects will surely be the same that they always
</p>
<p>have been.
</p>
<p>Before God and this nation, then, let this system be ar-
</p>
<p>raigned, charged, and tried as the great corrupter of the
</p>
<p>clergy, and, through them, of mankind. The bishops who
</p>
<p>defend it, if ignorant, ought to be confronted with its past
</p>
<p>history. If not ignorant, as is probably the case with all
</p>
<p>of them, then their criminal attempts to delude the Amer-
</p>
<p>ican people ought to be exposed.
</p>
<p>It is impossible to over-estimate the importance of this
</p>
<p>part of the subject. It has been well said by an intelli-
</p>
<p>gent French writer, once a Romanist, " The strength and
</p>
<p>vigor of Roman Catholics depend upon their priests ;
</p>
<p>through them is their only means of annoyance ; they are the
</p>
<p>true column of the Papacy." On no subject did Lafayette
</p>
<p>feel more deeply. Let us heed his warning voice. He
</p>
<p>said, " AMERICAN LIBERTY CAN BE DESTROYED ONLY BY THE
</p>
<p>POPISH CLERGY."
</p>
<p>But let us be just. Young men are not corrupt, as a
</p>
<p>general fact, when they enter the Popish seminaries to
</p>
<p>prepare to become priests. It is the system of celibacy,
</p>
<p>and the confessional, and the company of priests already
</p>
<p>corrupted that corrupt them in successive generations in
</p>
<p>actual life. Those who are thus seduced and corrupted
</p>
<p>by an abominable system deserve our pity, although they
</p>
<p>do finally become hardened and reprobate.
</p>
<p>But what shall be said of that great central corpora-
</p>
<p>tion which, well knowing from age to age that this system
</p>
<p>was inundating the world with pollution, has, from mo-
</p>
<p>tives of power and profit, under hypocritical pretences

<p>of holiness, and against all protestations and remon-

<p>CHAPTER VI.
</p>
<p>THE VOICE OF HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE.
</p>
<p>IT is fit that evidence should be adduced to sustain the
</p>
<p>correctness of the views which have been presented of the
</p>
<p>corrupting influence of the celibacy of the clergy and the
</p>
<p>confessional.
</p>
<p>The most common and popular evidence is found in those
</p>
<p>severe allegations which converted Romish priests have
</p>
<p>made against the morals of the Romish clergy, and which are
</p>
<p>in full accordance with the views which have been given.
</p>
<p>But the Romanists repudiate the statements of such, as the
</p>
<p>foul slander of apostate priests. Thus they try to destroy
</p>
<p>the force of the testimony of Anthony Gavin, in his Master
</p>
<p>Key to Popery ; of Blanco White, in his Practical and
</p>
<p>Internal Evidence against Catholicism ; of the Confes-
</p>
<p>sions of a Catholic Priest, edited by Professor S. F. B.
</p>
<p>Morse, of New York ; of Giustiniani ; of Hogue ; and of
</p>
<p>others. Thus to a considerable extent the force of these
</p>
<p>works, even on many thoughtful and candid Protestants, is
</p>
<p>neutralized.
</p>
<p>For a time, then, we ought to rise above them, and to
</p>
<p>look at the developments of history on a great scale and
</p>
<p>at the testimony of Romanists themselves. If we take
</p>
<p>this course we shall come to the conclusion that these men
</p>
<p>have spoken the truth, and that without exaggeration,

<p>162 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>and, indeed, that the evil tendencies and malignant results
</p>
<p>of the system cannot be exaggerated.
</p>
<p>There is, in fact, abundant evidence to justify every
</p>
<p>Protestant in this nation and in the world in assuming as
</p>
<p>a practical basis of action the following positions :
</p>
<p>That, in view of the known laws of human nature as
</p>
<p>established by God, and in view of the uniform and un-
</p>
<p>broken testimony of history, the celibacy .of the clergy,
</p>
<p>especially as connected with the duty of hearing confes-
</p>
<p>sions, is in the highest sense AN IMMORAL AND CRIMINAL
</p>
<p>INSTITUTION, hostile beyond the power of conception or
</p>
<p>expression alike to the religious, civil, and social interests
</p>
<p>of mankind, by reason of its malignant and corrupting
</p>
<p>power on the clergy, and, through them, on the com-
</p>
<p>munity.
</p>
<p>Moreover, though some of the Romish clergy may, in
</p>
<p>consequence of peculiarities of constitution or incidental
</p>
<p>or local influences, continue continent, yet in any particular
</p>
<p>case the presumption is always against every one who is
</p>
<p>under the influence of the system ; nor can this presumption
</p>
<p>be removed except by positive evidence to the contrary.
</p>
<p>And finally, such being the state of facts, there ought to
</p>
<p>be formed by divine aid, throughout this country and
</p>
<p>throughout the world, a sentiment of holy indignation so
</p>
<p>intense and all-pervading that it shall consume the system,
</p>
<p>and with it the energies of its guilty supporters, as with
</p>
<p>devouring fire.
</p>
<p>It is proper, in disclosing the testimony of history, to
</p>
<p>look with great care at that period when the church of
</p>
<p>Rome was in the ascendant throughout Europe, when
</p>
<p>there were no Protestants who had power to affect her by
</p>
<p>thoir public sentiment, but when all things were as she

</p>
<p>nad made them. There is one advantage in looking first
</p>
<p>THE VOICE OF HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE. 163
</p>
<p>at this period. We shall rely entirely on Roman Catholic
</p>
<p>documents. But first let us glance at the earlier ages.
</p>
<p>EARLY AGES.
</p>
<p>Celibacy, as has been remarked, sprung from heathenish
</p>
<p>errors. At first it was encouraged by public sentiment.
</p>
<p>In 385 Pope Siricius enjoined it on the clergy. Other
</p>
<p>popes and early provincial councils confirmed the injunc-
</p>
<p>tion. Yet it was so at war with God and Nature that it
</p>
<p>led to constant pollution too gross to be described.
</p>
<p>The same was true of the early monasteries. "With re-
</p>
<p>spect to these the statement of Isaac Taylor is comprehen-
</p>
<p>sive and sufficient :
</p>
<p>" It were better to sustain in patience the imputation
</p>
<p>of advancing exaggerated statements, and of giving a
</p>
<p>stronger color to an argument than the facts of the case
</p>
<p>would justify, than to do the uninitiated reader so serious
</p>
<p>an injury as to bring to light the evidence that bears upon
</p>
<p>this question. An appeal, therefore, is made to whoever
</p>
<p>has actually perused, or at least looked into, the ascetic
</p>
<p>writers, from Macarius, Ephraem, Palladius, and Cassian,
</p>
<p>downwards to those of the twelfth century. On the
</p>
<p>ground of the evidence which might from those sources
</p>
<p>be adduced a general result may be stated under three
</p>
<p>heads ; namely,
</p>
<p>" 1. That the monastic vow and the life of celibacy
</p>
<p>FAILED TO SECUEE THE PROFESSED OBJECT of the institu-
</p>
<p>tion iii all but a very few instances, and that it did not pro-
</p>
<p>mote that purity of the heart which was acknowledged to
</p>
<p>be its only good end.
</p>
<p>" 2. That, besides the evil of cutting men off from the
</p>
<p>common enjoyments, duties, and sympathies of life, the
</p>
<p>work of maintaining and defending their chastity (exterior
</p>
<p>and interior) absorbed almost the whole energies of those

</p>
<p>(a very few excepted) who sincerely labored at it ; so that
</p>
<p>164 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>to be chaste in fact and in heart was pretty nearly the
</p>
<p>sum of what the monk could do, even with the aid of
</p>
<p>starvation, excessive bodily toils, and depletic medicine ;
</p>
<p>to say nothing of his prayers, tears, and flagellations.
</p>
<p>" 3. That the monastic institution, even during its earlier
</p>
<p>and better era, entailed the most deplorable miseries and
</p>
<p>generated the foulest and most abominable practices ; so
</p>
<p>that, for every veritable saint which the monastery cherished,
</p>
<p>it made twenty wretches, whose moral condition was in
</p>
<p>the last degree pitiable or loathsome.
</p>
<p>"Now, shall we leave these propositions unsupported by
</p>
<p>proof? or will the Romanist, the pride and prop of whose
</p>
<p>church is monkery, challenge us to make good our alle-
</p>
<p>gations ? "
</p>
<p>This tendency of the system of celibacy to great moral
</p>
<p>corruption was so constant and notorious that efforts were
</p>
<p>made in successive centuries to effect a reformation by
</p>
<p>various councils, at which time indignant disclosures were
</p>
<p>made of the real state of facts. There were no Protestants
</p>
<p>at that time. It was thought that^ reforms might be ef-
</p>
<p>fectually carried on within the church ; and, in order to
</p>
<p>effect so desirable a purpose, open and bold disclosures
</p>
<p>were made.
</p>
<p>TIME OF GREGORY VII.
</p>
<p>Not unfrequently, in spite of popes and councils, those
</p>
<p>priests who desired to avoid the prevailing profligacy had
</p>
<p>recourse to marriage, as a divine and honorable ordinance
</p>
<p>of God ; and at the time of the accession of the ambitious
</p>
<p>and imperious Gregory VII., in the eleventh century,
</p>
<p>the priesthood very extensively lived in a state of mat-
</p>
<p>rimony.
</p>
<p>But he saw that, if this state of things continued, they
</p>
<p>could not be bound as his purposes required to the Roman

<p>see, nor could the property of bishops and other ecclesias-
</p>
<p>THE VOICE OP HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE. 165
</p>
<p>tics be retained in the hands of the church. Hence he
</p>
<p>rigorously enforced, against great opposition, the celibacy
</p>
<p>of the clergy. He prohibited the laity from hearing mass
</p>
<p>when celebrated by a married priest. The married clergy
</p>
<p>called Gregory the patron of heresy and the abetter of a
</p>
<p>mad system, who by violence would compel men to live as
</p>
<p>angels, stop the course of nature, and give the slackened
</p>
<p>reins to all pollution. But resistance was vain. By canons,
</p>
<p>decretals^ councils, false miracles, threats, violence, arms,
</p>
<p>fraud, flattery, anathemas, and excommunications he car-
</p>
<p>ried the day. His successors followed his example. That
</p>
<p>the great end aimed at has been the power of the Romish
</p>
<p>corporation, and not real chastity, is obvious from the
</p>
<p>fact that, whilst honorable marriage has been prohibited
</p>
<p>under pain of excommunication, concubinage has been con-
</p>
<p>nived at, and sometimes even licensed.
</p>
<p>After the celibacy of the clergy had, the eleventh
</p>
<p>century, been thoroughly enjoined, in the thirteenth century
</p>
<p>Innocent III. fully established and enforced auricular con-
</p>
<p>fession ; and thus was the existing system fully organized.
</p>
<p>From Gregory VII. to the time of the reformation Popery
</p>
<p>in its fullest development had been in constant operation
</p>
<p>a space of four centuries. If, then, as Bishop Kenrick af-
</p>
<p>firms, celibacy and the confessional tend to eminent holi-
</p>
<p>ness, the clergy, the church, and the world should have
</p>
<p>been eminently sanctified. How was it ?

</p>
<p>riously so, to such a degree as to scandalize and degrade
</p>
<p>the whole Christian world.
</p>
<p>In the preamble to a canon designed to reform the
</p>
<p>existing state of things they say,
</p>
<p>" On account of the crime of concubinage, with which
</p>
<p>multitudes of the clergy and monks are infected, the
</p>
<p>church of God and the whole clergy are held in derision,
</p>
<p>abomination, and dishonor among all nations ; and that
</p>
<p>abominable crime has so prevailed in the house of God
</p>
<p>that Christians do not now consider mere fornication a
</p>
<p>mortal sin." Council of Paris 1429, c. xxiii. ; Mansi,
</p>
<p>xxviii. p. 1107.
</p>
<p>Let it here be noticed that we have not a Protestant
</p>
<p>slander, nor the assertion of an individual, but the solemn
</p>
<p>decision of a grave Roman Catholic council, assembled in
</p>
<p>Paris, the capital of France, the centre of Europe. The
</p>
<p>disclosure of facts is clear and terrific ; but the attempted
</p>
<p>remedy was powerless.
</p>
<p>Turning from this council to the councils of Yalladolid
</p>
<p>and Toledo, in Spain, the first in 1322, the other in 1473,
</p>
<p>we find similar testimony. The first condemns " the
</p>
<p>outrageously dissolute lives of a portion of the clergy,
</p>
<p>who, regardless of reputation and safety, lived in public
</p>
<p>concubinage." The latter represented them as living in
</p>
<p>the filthiest atrocity, and as contemptible to the people,
</p>
<p>and as daring to touch the body of the Lord with polluted
</p>
<p>hands. A German council, in 1225, accused the priest-
</p>
<p>hood of unchastity, voluptuousness, and obscenity. Two
</p>
<p>councils in Cologne, in 1536 and 1549, even after the ref-
</p>
<p>ormation, repeated and augmented these charges. Ac-
</p>
<p>cording to them, monks, nuns, and clergy were alike de-
</p>
<p>filed. Of all others, the Italian and Roman clergy were
</p>
<p>most licentious. In 1538 a select council, convened by

<p>palaces, who at noonday walked or rode through the city,
</p>
<p>attended by the clergy and nobility, the friends of the
</p>
<p>cardinals. It is notorious that the Roman pontiffs were
</p>
<p>often as filthy as their clergy, and exemplified every spe-
</p>
<p>cies of licentiousness and pollution. Fornication, adul-
</p>
<p>tery, incest, and sodomy are in the list of their crimes.
</p>
<p>This testimony of Romish councils could be sustained by
</p>
<p>that of Ramish historians and divines too many to re-
</p>
<p>count. Nor is their testimony local ; it relates to every
</p>
<p>nation under the jurisdiction of Rome. Especially in the
</p>
<p>councils of Constance and of Basil were most astounding
</p>
<p>disclosures made by those who were urging the necessity
</p>
<p>of a reform. So also the statements of Nicholas de Cla-
</p>
<p>menge, J. .Trithemius, Stephen, Bishop of Brandenburg,
</p>
<p>and many others are horrific.
</p>
<p>Indeed the whole church and the whole world groaned
</p>
<p>under the all-pervading corruption generated by the law
</p>
<p>of celibacy. All historians, all councils, are full of the
</p>
<p>theme ; but language cannot utter all the fearful, the ap-
</p>
<p>palling truth. The eminently learned, impartial, and accu-
</p>
<p>rate Gieseler gives the following brief view of the state
</p>
<p>of the clergy during the fifteenth century up to the time
</p>
<p>of the reformation, sustaining his assertions by the irref-
</p>
<p>utable testimony of numerous Roman Catholic writers
</p>
<p>and councils :
</p>
<p>" Their chief offence, their INCONTINENCE, seemed to grow
</p>
<p>worse the more there was done to restrain it. The severe
</p>
<p>lectures read them on the subject at the councils of Con-
</p>
<p>stance and Basil had as little influence upon the conduct
</p>
<p>of most of the clergy there assembled as the decrees
</p>
<p>passed at those councils had on the state of the church at
</p>
<p>large in this respect. In no century had there been so
</p>
<p>many decrees passed against the concubinage of the clergy
</p>
<p>as in the fifteenth ; yet in none were complaints so com-

</p>
<p>even into unnatural vices,) as well as derision and lamen-
</p>
<p>tation over the inefficiency of all the means used to restrain
</p>
<p>them. The number of the offenders made it difficult or
</p>
<p>impossible to carry into effect the more severe punishments ;
</p>
<p>whilst the avarice of the bishops was easily gratified by
</p>
<p>substituting therefor pecuniary mulcts, which soon changed
</p>
<p>into an annual tax. The commonness of the offence made
</p>
<p>it seem to the clergy themselves a light thing. Of course
</p>
<p>the laity could not be expected to view it in any other
</p>
<p>light ; and in consequence the vice increased to a fearful
</p>
<p>degree, so as at the end of the fifteenth century to give
</p>
<p>birth to a new and disgusting disease. As early as the
</p>
<p>council of Constance it was openly said that nothing could
</p>
<p>remedy these evils but to allow the marriage of priests ;
</p>
<p>but such was the strength of prejudice that men in other
</p>
<p>respects liberal in their views as, for instance, the Chan-
</p>
<p>cellor Gerson resisted every effort to change the existing
</p>
<p>laws of the church. There always continued to be intel-
</p>
<p>ligent men who advocated the marriage of priests ; but
</p>
<p>THE INTERESTS OF THE HIERARCHY were too deeply involved
</p>
<p>in the question to expect them to yield." Yol. iii. pp.

</p>
<p>CHARACTER OF BISHOPS AND COUNCILS.
</p>
<p>We need not wonder that the decrees of councils pro-
</p>
<p>duced no effect, since it was well known that a large pro-
</p>
<p>portion of the bishops composing them were guilty of the
</p>
<p>same offence, and none were free from the suspicion. In-
</p>
<p>deed at the councils themselves many of the clergy openly
</p>
<p>had their concubines. Hence Petrus de Pulka, professor
</p>
<p>in Vienna, said, in an address delivered before the council
</p>
<p>of Constance, "Attend and consider! Behold how the
</p>
<p>clergy of the Roman court, which, from the commence-
</p>
<p>ment of this schism, is regarded as depraved beyond hu-
</p>

</p>
<p>obey our injunctions ! Consider, I pray you, whether from
</p>
<p>reverence to this sacred synod, in whose presence they daily
</p>
<p>are, they have even in the least degree amended their dis-
</p>
<p>solute lives. Undeniably the clergy of the Roman court
</p>
<p>are affirmed to retain their concubines without shame be-
</p>
<p>fore all." The Viennese manuscript asserts that there
</p>
<p>were in attendance on the council of Constance, by which
</p>
<p>Huss was burned for heresy, fifteen hundred common or
</p>
<p>public women.
</p>
<p>This state of things in the council of Lyons was still
</p>
<p>worse. It totally demoralized the city where it was con-
</p>
<p>vened.
</p>
<p>The celebrated Chancellor Gerson, who was one of the
</p>
<p>ruling spirits of the council of Constance, in his answer
</p>
<p>to Saignet acknowledged the impossibility of checking the
</p>
<p>incontinence of the clergy, and accommodated his theory
</p>
<p>of morals to the fact. He held that by incontinency the
</p>
<p>clergy did not violate their vows, but by marriage they
</p>
<p>did ; for they merely vowed not to contract marriage, but
</p>
<p>did not vow to be continent. To remedy the evil as far
</p>
<p>as may be, he recommends " to sin in that way as little as
</p>
<p>possible, and meantime to do as many good deeds as pos-
</p>
<p>sible, and to be very careful when they do sin not to do it
</p>
<p>openly, or on the festivals, or in sacred places, or with,
</p>
<p>married persons." "What must have been the effect of the
</p>
<p>Romish system of celibacy on morals when the most emi-
</p>
<p>nent man in the church at that time could thus write?
</p>
<p>The decree of the council of Basil in 1435, as Gieseler
</p>
<p>states it, prohibited all priests to live in open concubinage.
</p>
<p>This provision would seem to be based upon the moral
</p>
<p>principles of Chancellor Gerson. At a synod in Breslau
</p>
<p>and in various councils, especially in Italy, fines were im-
</p>
<p>posed on such offenders ; and, in spite of decrees of other
</p>
<p>councils, this practice was extensively adopted by the

<p>bishops thus making the vices of the clergy a source of
</p>
<p>gain.
</p>
<p>Agrippa mentions a bishop who boasted of having in
</p>
<p>his diocese eleven thousand priests, who severally paid
</p>
<p>their superior every year a guinea for leave to keep con-
</p>
<p>cubines. (See Edgar, p. 526.)
</p>
<p>POPULAR BELIEF AND FEELING.
</p>
<p>Gieseler says, " The laity were glad in any way to se-
</p>
<p>cure their families from the attacks of priestly lust, and fa-
</p>
<p>vored, or even furthered, the permanent connection of their
</p>
<p>priests with concubines." Vol. iii. p. 83.
</p>
<p>Nicholas of Clamenge says, " The laity are so thorough-
</p>
<p>ly convinced that all the clergy are incontinent that in
</p>
<p>very many parishes they will not tolerate a priest unless
</p>
<p>he has a concubine. This they do to defend their wives,
</p>
<p>who even thus are by no means out of danger." (Giese-
</p>
<p>ler, iii. 83.) The Swiss especially took this course. ^Eneas
</p>
<p>Sylvius, who became pope, says of the Frieslanders, "They
</p>
<p>are unwilling to receive priests who have no wives, fear-
</p>
<p>ing that they will defile those of other men ; for they re-
</p>
<p>gard it as unnatural and impossible for unmarried men to
</p>
<p>live in continence." Gieseler, iii. 83.
</p>
<p>This was also the opinion of j^Eneas Sylvius himself;
</p>
<p>and on this ground he defended himself when in the coun-
</p>
<p>cil of Basil he received from his father the intelligence of
</p>
<p>the birth of a son. Accordingly when cardinal and when
</p>
<p>pope he conceded that, viewing the question simply on the
</p>
<p>ground of principle, the law of clerical celibacy ought to
</p>
<p>be abolished.

</p>
<p>This state of open corruption did not at once disappear
</p>
<p>even after the reformation. And even now the same great
</p>
<p>river of pollution flows through Romish countries, al-
</p>
<p>though its course is more under ground.
</p>
<p>On this point the learned, cautious, and discriminating
</p>
<p>Isaac Taylor says, " It is fair to assume that, of a body of
</p>
<p>men taken at hazard from the mass and placed under the
</p>
<p>restraint (or rather the profession) of continence, a con-
</p>

<p>come thoroughly profligate. The notorious condition of

<p>those countries where nothing has forbidden the natural
</p>
<p>expansion of the Romish system would warrant our af-
</p>
<p>firming that two thirds of its clergy come under such a
</p>
<p>description. Nay, perhaps our English credulity would

<p>of the sacerdotal class were not utterly debauched." Fa-

<p>.CHAPTER VII.
</p>
<p>BISHOP KENRICK'S DEFENCE.
</p>
<p>MANY wonders occur in the history of this world
</p>
<p>among which may be mentioned the bold assertions of
</p>
<p>Bishop Kenrick in defence of the confessional in the
</p>
<p>hands of an unmarried clergy.
</p>
<p>In the number of Brownson's Quarterly for July, 1846,
</p>
<p>is an article intended as a defence of the Romish system
</p>
<p>of the confessional. We have good authority for ascrib-
</p>
<p>ing it to the pen of Bishop Kenrick. Public attention has
</p>
<p>of late been somewhat directed towards his own writings
</p>
<p>on this subject, and he seems to feel that he is called on
</p>
<p>to step forward in defence of the system. Bishop Kenrick
</p>
<p>is, undoubtedly, one of the ablest defenders of Romanism
</p>
<p>in this country ; and his works on doctrinal and moral the-
</p>
<p>ology, as well as his defence of the Papal supremacy, indi-
</p>
<p>cate no small degree of natural ability. If he were but
</p>
<p>on the side of truth he would be an able writer indeed :
</p>
<p>as it is, his naturally good powers are continually crippled
</p>
<p>by the false and absurd system which he has undertaken
</p>
<p>to defend.
</p>
<p>He says, in the language of another, " If it led to licen-
</p>
<p>tiousness or danger, that licentiousness or that danger
</p>
<p>would have come to light, and there would be tongues
</p>
<p>enough to tell it."
</p>
<p>This implies that such licentiousness and danger have

</p>
<p>not come to light and have not been told by millions of
</p>
<p>tongues. On this point let history testify.
</p>
<p>He, however, does not go radically into the defence of
</p>
<p>the confessional, because, as he assures us, he regards
</p>
<p>it as needless to reply at great length " to the charges
</p>
<p>advanced against an institution which is essentially di-
</p>
<p>rected to wash away the defilements of sin, and which
</p>
<p>is in the church like a majestic river, whose waters
</p>
<p>absorb the impurities which they meet with in their
</p>
<p>course."
</p>
<p>On the other hand, he seems to repose most confidence
</p>
<p>in an appeal to the observation of American Protestants,
</p>
<p>and also to the convictions of American Romanists. With
</p>
<p>affecting simplicity he says, p. 337, " Without referring
</p>
<p>our readers to distant or past evidence, we at once ap-
</p>
<p>peal to the instinctive feeling of the Catholic community
</p>
<p>around us."
</p>
<p>Is there not crafty philosophy in this ? One would think
</p>
<p>that the proper way to test the Romish system of the con-
</p>
<p>fessional would be to go to those communities in which it
</p>
<p>has exercised its full power, unobstructed by Protestant-
</p>
<p>ism, and developed its mature results. For example : the
</p>
<p>pope has taken great pains to purge Italy by fire and
</p>
<p>sword of the least leaven of Protestantism. Why not,
</p>
<p>then, appeal to Italy, and hold up the spotless purity of
</p>
<p>society there, where the confessional has poured out its
</p>
<p>full stream of purifying influence for ages ? Why not
</p>
<p>give us a little of the history of morals at Rome, the cen-
</p>
<p>tre of the system ? 0, no ; the bishop does not inteud to
</p>
<p>furnish us with any such distant or past evidence. With
</p>
<p>striking sagacity he comes into the midst of communities
</p>
<p>where Protestantism is in the ascendency and has created
</p>
<p>a high tone of morals ; where Romanists are a small
</p>
<p>minority, surrounded by vigilant eyes, exposed to the

<p>searching scrutiny of Protestant presses, over which Ro-
</p>
<p>manism has not yet been able to establish a censorship.
</p>
<p>Yes ; he comes here and makes his appeal to Catholics in
</p>
<p>these circumstances for evidence of the purifying power
</p>
<p>of the confessional. We tell the bishop, in all frankness,
</p>
<p>that he very much underrates the intellect of his Prot-
</p>
<p>estant readers if he thinks that they are to be affected by
</p>
<p>such reasoning as this. But as he does not see fit to refer
</p>
<p>his readers to distant or past evidence, we shall endeavor
</p>
<p>in some degree to supply his lack of service.
</p>
<p>EXPERIENCE OF SPAIN.
</p>
<p>"We will, then, summon the bishop and our readers to a
</p>
<p>country eminently blessed with Romish influences ; fa-
</p>
<p>vored as the great head quarters of the Inquisition, which,
</p>
<p>by fire and sword and tortures ineffable, has thoroughly
</p>
<p>purged out the leaven of Protestantism. We need not
</p>
<p>say that this country is SPAIN.
</p>
<p>Is it not a just and equitable rule to look for the true
</p>
<p>tendencies of a system where it has a fair field and full
</p>
<p>opportunity to develop itself, and nothing to check its
</p>
<p>course ? Here, then, ought we to see the full power of
</p>
<p>the confessional, as a majestic river washing away the de-
</p>
<p>filements of sin.
</p>
<p>But how was it ? We answer, It was so ordered in the
</p>
<p>providence of God that precisely here was made in the
</p>
<p>most conspicuous manner, and in sight of all nations, a
</p>
<p>public display of the ineffable pollutions and defilements
</p>
<p>of the system, and of the utter want of power and also
</p>
<p>of hearty will on the part of the managers of the system
</p>
<p>to prevent them.

</p>
<p>It appears, then, that, at the close of half a century after
</p>
<p>BISHOP KEXRICK'S DEFENCE. 175
</p>
<p>the reformation, Lutheran opinions have so far prevailed in
</p>
<p>Spain as to call for four autos da fe against the Lutherans,
</p>
<p>two in Valladolid and two in Seville. It was also dis-
</p>
<p>covered that the tendency towards Lutheranism was in-
</p>
<p>creased by a general persuasion of the profligacy of the
</p>
<p>priests, and in particular by the public accusation that
</p>
<p>they used the confessional as a means of seduction. This
</p>
<p>led to sundry remarks, not peculiarly agreeable, with
</p>
<p>respect to the Roman church as the mother of harlots and
</p>
<p>of abominations.
</p>
<p>So pressing was the exigency of the case that report
</p>
<p>was made to the pope, and he felt compelled to interpose.
</p>
<p>Accordingly, on January 18, 1556, Paul IY. addressed a
</p>
<p>brief to the inquisitors of Grenada, in which he com-
</p>
<p>manded them to prosecute those priests whom the public
</p>
<p>voice accused of seduction, and not to pardon one of them.
</p>
<p>The Archbishop of Grenada and the council of the Inquisi-
</p>
<p>tion decided that the publication of the brief in the usual
</p>
<p>form would produce great inconveniences, and that prudence
</p>
<p>and moderation were needed. They therefore, to remedy
</p>
<p>the evil, privately notified the confessors in general of the
</p>
<p>purport of the brief, and said nothing to the people.
</p>
<p>This course convinced the pope that the abuse was not
</p>
<p>confined to the kingdom of Grenada. Accordingly, in 1561,
</p>
<p>Pius IY. addressed a brief to Yaldes, the inquisitor general,
</p>
<p>authorizing him to proceed against the guilty confessors in
</p>
<p>all the domains of Philip, the most Catholic king. This
</p>
<p>bull affirmed the crime to exist " in the kingdoms of Spain
</p>
<p>and in the cities and dioceses thereof."
</p>
<p>It seems to have been still judged inexpedient by the
</p>
<p>ecclesiastics and inquisitors in most provinces to give
</p>
<p>this notice. But in some, and especially in Seville, the in-
</p>
<p>quisitors gave the required public notice and called for

</p>
<p>abused and all privy to such acts to inform the Inquisition
</p>
<p>within thirty days, attaching severe penalties to the neglect
</p>
<p>or disobedience of the injunction. Then followed a scene
</p>
<p>unparalleled in the history of the world ; but, in the prov-
</p>
<p>idence of God, it was a true and fearful revelation of
</p>
<p>Popery. In the words of Edgar, " Maids and matrons of
</p>
<p>the nobility and peasantry, of every rank and situation,
</p>
<p>crowded to the Inquisition. The fair informers in Seville
</p>
<p>alone were so numerous that all the inquisitors and twenty
</p>
<p>notaries were insufficient in thirty days to take their deposi-
</p>
<p>tions. Thirty additional days had three several times to be
</p>
<p>appointed for the reception of informations. And finally
</p>
<p>the multitude of criminals, the jealousy of husbands, and
</p>
<p>the odium which the discovery threw on auricular confes-
</p>
<p>sion and the Popish priesthood caused the sacred tribunal
</p>
<p>to quash the prosecution and to consign the depositions to
</p>
<p>oblivion." (See Edgar's Variations of Popery, pp. 528,
</p>
<p>529, and McCrie's History of the Reformation in Spain,
</p>
<p>p. 242.)
</p>
<p>For authorities to sustain these facts, Edgar refers to
</p>
<p>Gonsalvus, Lorente, and Limborch. The pungency and
</p>
<p>particularity of the statement seem to come from Gon-
</p>
<p>salvus, whom Lorente calls Raynaldus Gonzalvius Mon-
</p>
<p>tanus, and McCrie Montanus. All agree that the accusa-
</p>
<p>tions ceased because the demand of the Inquisition was
</p>
<p>repealed. But Lorente thinks that Gonsalvus exaggerates
</p>
<p>the number of the informers. It were to be hoped that it
</p>
<p>is so for the honor of humanity ; but, on any view of the
</p>
<p>case, what can be conceived of more horrible than such a
</p>
<p>disclosure of priestly villany and depravity ?
</p>

</p>
<p>discovery and exposure of the seraglio of the inquisitors

<p>earlier generation. At all events, they manifested a
</p>
<p>remarkable leniency towards the crime of seduction. To
</p>
<p>be a Lutheran was intolerable. Nothing, could atone for
</p>
<p>it but to be burned at a public auto da fe. Lorente, how-
</p>
<p>ever, informs us that those guilty of seduction by the
</p>
<p>confessional were never publicly exposed at an auto da fe.
</p>
<p>They made a private confession and abjuration of their
</p>
<p>practical heresy and of all others, and were then absolved
</p>
<p>and confined for a time in a convent !
</p>
<p>Here, then, we have a fair illustration of the manner in
</p>
<p>which the confessional washed away the pollution of Spain.
</p>
<p>So, too, would it now purify America, if Romanism had
</p>
<p>had the ascendency here that it has had in Spain.
</p>
<p>Does this look like the course of a majestic river, washing
</p>
<p>away the defilements of sin ? or like a part of her system
</p>
<p>upon whose forehead was a name written, Mystery, Babylon
</p>
<p>the great, the mother of harlots and abominations of the
</p>
<p>earth? Do not such results flow inevitably from the con-
</p>
<p>fessional in the hands of an unmarried clergy? Nor is
</p>
<p>this a state of things peculiar to Spain. It is impossible
</p>
<p>to make such a system tend to any thing but pollution. It
</p>
<p>is in direct violation of the great laws of human society
</p>
<p>ordained by God himself, and it creates an intensity of
</p>
<p>temptation that on the great scale never was resisted, and
</p>
<p>never will be. In the words of the Eclectic Review, " It
</p>
<p>is a terrible reality, acting alike on priests and people in
</p>
<p>Catholic countries, making the priest's life a true misery,
</p>
<p>converting him into a spy and a tool, compelling him who
</p>
<p>has vowed before God to proclaim the truth into a studied
</p>
<p>and inevitable supporter of the most infamous fraud, a
</p>
<p>corrupter of the minds of the young, and a tyrant where he
</p>
<p>should be the friend." And let any one study thoroughly
</p>
<p>the state of things in Italy, and he will find it worse, if

</p>
<p>Rome. And in Germany, Austria, France, Mexico, South
</p>
<p>America, and Cuba, is there any reason why the same
</p>
<p>system should not produce the same results ? To prove
</p>
<p>that such is the fact, we shall proceed to state a few more
</p>
<p>facts for the consideration of the bishop.
</p>
<p>Meantime we repeat the strong statement of the Ec-
</p>
<p>lectic Review, than which nothing more true was ever
</p>
<p>uttered :
</p>
<p>"IT IS BECAUSE THE CONFESSIONAL HAS BECOME THE
</p>
<p>SOUL TRAP OP SATAN AND THE WELL OF ALL SPIRITUAL POL-
</p>
<p>LUTIONS THAT THE POPULAR MIND HAS REVOLTED FROM THE
</p>
<p>SYSTEM THROUGHOUT GERMANY, AND WILL REVOLT FROM IT,
</p>
<p>FINALLY, EVERY WHERE."
</p>
<p>And shall America nourish a system of pollution which
</p>
<p>even Catholic Europe, with all its degradation, is about to
</p>
<p>reject and abhor ?
</p>
<p>PROOF FROM BISHOP KENRICK AND PAPAL LEGISLATION.
</p>
<p>Is it to be supposed, then, that Bishop Kenrick knew
</p>
<p>these facts when he said of the confessional, " If it led to
</p>
<p>licentiousness or danger, that licentiousness or that danger
</p>
<p>would have come to light, and there would be tongues
</p>
<p>enough to tell it " ? We answer, Certainly ; there is the
</p>
<p>best possible evidence of the fact even the incidental
</p>
<p>testimony of the'bishop himself.
</p>
<p>He well knew, and will not dare to deny it, as will soon
</p>
<p>appear, that the evils of clerical seduction by means of the
</p>
<p>confessional even since the reformation have been so great
</p>
<p>in European countries as to cause a scandal so widespread
</p>
<p>as to endanger the interests of the Papacy. Urged by

</p>
<p>such considerations, he well knew that several popes in
</p>
<p>BISHOP KENBICKS DEFENCE. 179
</p>
<p>succession were compelled to issue bull after bull designed
</p>
<p>to rectify the evil. Moreover we have his own confession
</p>
<p>on the subject.
</p>
<p>What, then, does Bishop Kenrick say as it regards the
</p>
<p>use of the confessional as a means of priestly seduction ?
</p>
<p>He confesses, in express terms, that it has been so used,
</p>
<p>and he occupies seven pages of the third volume of his
</p>
<p>treatise on moral theology in stating the legislation that
</p>
<p>the existence of this practice has rendered necessary in
</p>
<p>the Romish church. These pages occur in Tractatus xix.,
</p>
<p>De Poenitentia, chap. x. sect, vi., entitled De Crimine
</p>
<p>Solicitationis, vol. iii. pp. 235-240. Of this legislation I
</p>
<p>shall give some account in its place. I will here in general
</p>
<p>remark, that no one can read these seven pages in Bishop
</p>
<p>Kenrick and not find in them internal evidence of the
</p>
<p>widespread existence in Romish communities of the very
</p>
<p>things alleged by converted Romish priests, and which
</p>
<p>Romanists call slander. He will find detailed legislation on
</p>
<p>the subject of seduction by the confessional of such a kind
</p>
<p>as never could exist without a corresponding cause in the
</p>
<p>state of the body politic demanding it. What that cause
</p>
<p>is was clearly disclosed in the progress of the effort in
</p>
<p>Spain which we have already detailed, put forth by the
</p>
<p>full power of the pope and the Inquisition, to prosecute
</p>
<p>and punish those who had been guilty of priestly seduction
</p>
<p>by means of the confessional. The attempt proved that
</p>
<p>the whole body of the clergy were so deeply implicated
</p>
<p>that it became necessary to abandon the prosecution in
</p>
<p>order to save their characters from ruin.
</p>
<p>Let us, then, consider the confession of Bishop Kenrick
</p>
<p>himself. At the commencement of his discussion of the
</p>
<p>topic of priestly seduction by means of the confessional

</p>
<p>he writes as follows. We translate from the Latin :
</p>
<p>THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>SECTION VI. CONCERNING THE CRIME OF SEDUCTION.
</p>
<p>" We scarcely dare to speak concerning that atrocious
</p>
<p>crime in which the office of hearing confession is perverted
</p>
<p>to the ruin of souls by impious men under the influence
</p>
<p>of their lusts. Would that we could regard it as solely
</p>
<p>a conception of the mind and as something invented by
</p>
<p>the enemies of the faith for the purposes of slander ! But
</p>
<p>it is not fit that we should be ignorant of the decrees
</p>
<p>which the pontiffs have issued to defend the sacredness of
</p>
<p>this sacrament."
</p>
<p>So, then, Bishop Kenrick himself being judge, the crime
</p>
<p>of priestly seduction by means of the confessional is not a
</p>
<p>mere imaginary conception, but an atrocious reality. It
</p>
<p>is not a slander of the enemies of the church, but a noto-
</p>
<p>rious historic truth so notorious that it is in vain to
</p>
<p>deny it so notorious that many pontiffs have been
</p>
<p>obliged to issue their decrees to defend the sacredness of
</p>
<p>the sacrament of confession.
</p>
<p>Well, too, does Bishop Kenrick say that it is not fit
</p>
<p>that we should be ignorant of these decrees. It is not fit.
</p>
<p>We will endeavor to dissipate this ignorance. They throw
</p>
<p>great light on the subject. They reveal the existence of
</p>
<p>a state of society in Catholic communities which nothing
</p>
<p>but the system of the private confession of females to an
</p>
<p>unmarried priesthood could produce. And when Bishop
</p>
<p>Kenrick now comes forward to advocate the cause of all
</p>
<p>these evils, and to urge its universal introduction among
</p>
<p>us, we will do all in our power to dissipate the ignorance
</p>
<p>that still exists on a system so powerful and so pernicious.

</p>
<p>But, before we proceed to consider the Papal legislation
</p>
<p>BISHOP KENRICK'S DEFENCE. 181
</p>
<p>on this subject, we will consider the proper mode of rea-
</p>
<p>soning from such legislation.
</p>
<p>Professor William Smyth, of the University of Cam-
</p>
<p>bridge, England, in order to throw light on the state of
</p>
<p>society among the barbarians, devotes part of one lecture
</p>
<p>to a consideration of their codes of laws. After giving
</p>
<p>a general view of the salic code, he proceeds to illustrate
</p>
<p>the manner of reasoning from such codes. We quote a
</p>
<p>part of his statements, with the design of applying the
</p>
<p>same mode of reasoning to the Papal legislation as stated
</p>
<p>by Bishop Kenrick :
</p>
<p>" Whenever the laws of a nation can be perused, a va-
</p>
<p>riety of conclusions can be drawn from them which the
</p>
<p>laws themselves were never intended to convey conclu-
</p>
<p>sions that relate to the manners and situation of a nation
</p>
<p>more certain and important than can in any other way be
</p>
<p>obtained. I will give a specimen of this sort of reason-
</p>
<p>ing ; and my hearer must hereafter employ the same sort
</p>
<p>of reasoning on these codes and on every system of laws
</p>
<p>which he has ever an opportunity of considering. For
</p>
<p>instance, there is one head that respects petty thefts of
</p>
<p>different kinds.
</p>
<p>"He who stole a knife was to be fined fifteen solidi;
</p>
<p>but, though he stole as much flax as he could carry, he
</p>
<p>was only tined three. Iron was, therefore, difficult to pro-
</p>
<p>cure, or its manufacture not easy. The fertility of the
</p>
<p>land had done more for these Franks than their own pa-
</p>
<p>tience or ingenuity ; i. e., they were barbarians. Again :
</p>
<p>he who killed another was only fined ; but we are not to
</p>
<p>suppose that this arose from any superior tenderness of
</p>
<p>disposition. There is a distinct head in these laws (the
</p>
<p>thirty-first) on the subject of mutilations ; the very first
</p>
<p>clause runs thus :
</p>
<p>" ' If any one shall cut off a foot, or hand, or dig out an

</p>
<p>eye, or cut off an ear or nose of any one/ &c.
</p>
<p>' The most horrible excesses evidently took place.
</p>
<p>Nothing more need be said of the manners or disposition
</p>
<p>of a people in whose laws such outrages are particularized.
</p>
<p>16
</p>
<p>182 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>" That union of tenderness and courage, of sympathy
</p>
<p>and fortitude, of the softer and severer virtues which
</p>
<p>forms the perfection of the human character is not to be
</p>
<p>found among savage nations ; it is only the occasional and
</p>
<p>inestimable production of civilized life.
</p>
<p>" Again : there is mention made of hedges and en-
</p>
<p>closures. Agriculture had, therefore, made some prog-
</p>
<p>ress."
</p>
<p>In the same way, from the laws of ancient Greece and
</p>
<p>Rome we can reason as to the state Of society in those na-
</p>
<p>tions ; for laws are not formed on mere theory, to guard
</p>
<p>against imaginary crimes, nor do they enter into the minute
</p>
<p>detail of unknown crimes by way of anticipation : they
</p>
<p>are designed to be a defence against real and existing
</p>
<p>evils.
</p>
<p>So is it with regard to the legislation of the popes on
</p>
<p>this subject ; for it is incredible that any pope would
</p>
<p>have descended into the particulars of all the various
</p>
<p>modes of priestly seduction, and detailed things so offen-
</p>
<p>sive and abominable, even the idea and the very sugges-
</p>
<p>tion of which tend to injure the priesthood, if the corrupt
</p>
<p>workings of the confessional had not brought out all these
</p>
<p>details in fact.
</p>
<p>We easily see the evil tendencies of the confessional in
</p>
<p>theory ; but here we see them developed in real life, and
</p>
<p>our convictions of the evils of the system are greatly
</p>
<p>deepened. It is always perfectly plain that the confes-
</p>
<p>sional is liable to be used for purposes of seduction in
</p>
<p>numerous ways. It is also plain that the priests are, by
</p>
<p>compulsory celibacy, placed in circumstances of the high-
</p>
<p>est temptation to use it for such purposes. No system
</p>
<p>can be more perfectly framed to secure such an end.
</p>
<p>And yet, until Papal laws are read, no one would easily
</p>
<p>imagine in how many ways it has been so used. To

</p>
<p>get light on this point, we turn to Bishop Kenrick's
</p>
<p>BISHOP KENBICK'S DEFENCE. 183
</p>
<p>statement of Papal legislation. By examining this legis-
</p>
<p>lation, we arrive at the following results. The state
</p>
<p>of things in the Roman Catholic Church has rendered it
</p>
<p>necessary to specify nineteen different ways in which ad-
</p>
<p>vantage can be taken of the system of the confessional as
</p>
<p>a means of seduction, and to declare that whoever uses it
</p>
<p>in any of these ways is to be reported to the Inquisition
</p>
<p>by the female solicited. These nineteen cases are sub-
</p>
<p>divided and classified as follows :
</p>
<p>1. Solicitation during the act of confession, five cases.
</p>
<p>2. Solicitation before the act of confession, two cases.
</p>
<p>3. Solicitation immediately after confession, three cases.
</p>
<p>4. Solicitation to which confession furnishes an occa-
</p>
<p>sion, four cases.
</p>
<p>5. Solicitation under the pretext of confession, two cases.
</p>
<p>6. Solicitation in the confessional, although no con-
</p>
<p>fession is made, one* case.
</p>
<p>7. Solicitation in any other place besides the confes-
</p>
<p>sional, if it is used for purposes of confession, two cases.
</p>
<p>Now, who can even read over this general statement of
</p>
<p>the topics of these laws and not receive new light as to
</p>
<p>the extensive applicability of the confessional for purposes
</p>
<p>of seduction ? It can be used before confession, during
</p>
<p>confession, and immediately after confession. It furnishes
</p>
<p>occasions for seduction long after confession is over. It
</p>
<p>furnishes a pretext for seduction ; it furnishes a place for
</p>
<p>it ; and, if there is no confessional, a place can be chosen
</p>
<p>where the same diabolical purpose can be prosecuted.
</p>
<p>By the celibacy of the clergy they are led into the
</p>
<p>highest degree of temptation, and then by the confessional
</p>
<p>there is offered to them every variety of excitement and
</p>
<p>of aid to prosecute the gratification of their excited de-
</p>
<p>sires. But, if we descend to the details of these nineteen

</p>
<p>cases as given by Bishop Kenrick, we shall obtain a still
</p>
<p>184 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>more vivid conception of the actual use of the system for
</p>
<p>this purpose.
</p>
<p>For an example, I will take the second specification of
</p>
<p>the fourth general division i. e., solicitation to which
</p>
<p>confession furnishes an occasion. This is the case of one
</p>
<p>Qui, ex fragilitate in confessione cognita, sumit occasianem,
</p>
<p>earn tcntandi " Who, from any frailty discovered in con-
</p>
<p>fession, takes an occasion afterwards to tempt the female
</p>
<p>who has confessed."
</p>
<p>How clearly does this specification bring the wide-
</p>
<p>spread working of that pernicious system before the mind !
</p>
<p>Here, now, is an unmarried priest surrounded by hundreds
</p>
<p>or thousands of females. They have their frailties, their
</p>
<p>impure thoughts, their temptations, it may be their lapses ;
</p>
<p>but, without the system of the confessional, no man could
</p>
<p>tell what they are. And, if a licentious or tempted un-
</p>
<p>married priest wished to seduce any of his flock, he would
</p>
<p>have no guide ; and, ignorant and fearful, he might be re-
</p>
<p>pelled from the attempt. But here the confessional comes
</p>
<p>to his aid. It spreads before him a perfect map of every
</p>
<p>female heart in his whole flock, for they are to disclose to
</p>
<p>him their most secret thoughts as to God ; for in hearing
</p>
<p>confession, as Dens tells us, he acts as God, and not as
</p>
<p>man. And now he knows the weaknesses, the tempta-
</p>
<p>tions, the frailties, and the falls of every one ; he studies
</p>
<p>their characters ; he knows how to approach them ; and,
</p>
<p>wherever afterwards he may meet them, the disclosures
</p>
<p>of the confessional are present to his mind, and furnish
</p>
<p>him with innumerable occasions to compass his end.
</p>
<p>Of what use is it, now, to pass a law that he who avails
</p>
<p>himself of any of these occasions to tempt a female shall
</p>
<p>be reported by that female to the Inquisition ? You might
</p>
<p>as well pour water on an inclined plane, and then by law

</p>
<p>forbid it to run down. But this is only one out of nine-
</p>
<p>BISHOP KENRICK'S DEFENCE. 185
</p>
<p>teen specifications. Let us look at another. Take the
</p>
<p>fourth specification under the same division ; it is the case
</p>
<p>of one Qui aliquem solicitat, promittens se earn confitentem,
</p>
<p>ddnceps excepturum " Who solicits a female to sin, prom-
</p>
<p>ising that he will afterwards receive her to make confes-
</p>
<p>sion." What power of temptation in the system does this
</p>
<p>simple statement disclose ! It not only gives to the priest
</p>
<p>light to choose his victims, but, if any through fear of the
</p>
<p>penalties of sin refuse to comply with his desires, it ena-
</p>
<p>bles him to say. You need not fear the consequences ; have
</p>
<p>I not the power to remit sins? Comply with my request,
</p>
<p>and then I will hear you confess and free you from all
</p>
<p>guilt. After having furnished such means of temptation
</p>
<p>and delusion, how vain the hope that any law will check
</p>
<p>their use ! The trial in Spain to execute the laws clearly
</p>
<p>proved that the system produced its natural results and
</p>
<p>that the laws were of no avail. Even the attempt to
</p>
<p>execute them was abandoned.
</p>
<p>Take another instance from the first division, case five :
</p>
<p>Charta ad venerem incitans, seu liter CB amatorite, in tribunale
</p>
<p>traditce, solicitationis, instar sunt "Any thing written on
</p>
<p>paper adapted to excite love, or a love letter, delivered in
</p>
<p>the tribunal, is equivalent to solicitation in the confession-
</p>
<p>al." This principle was first established by Alexander
</p>
<p>TIL, in 1655, in opposition to a contrary doctrine. This is
</p>
<p>worthy of the more notice as tending to throw light on the
</p>
<p>effects of the confessional on the morals of Romish ecclesi-
</p>
<p>astics ; for it appears by the testimony of Bishop Kenrick
</p>
<p>that the following proposition had actually been maintained
</p>
<p>by some of them : "A confessor who in the sacrament of
</p>
<p>confession gives the penitent a letter to be read after-
</p>
<p>wards, iu which he excites her to love, is not regarded as
</p>
<p>having solicited her in confession, and therefore is not to be
</p>
<p>reported." (See vol. iii. Theologia Moralis, p. 236.) This

<p>proposition Alexander VII. felt himself called on to con-
</p>
<p>demn. To what a state of degradation must the system
</p>
<p>of the confessional have reduced priestly morals when
</p>
<p>the pontiff was obliged to condemn such a proposition as
</p>
<p>this ! and how clearly it shows that, although many speci-
</p>
<p>fications had been at first condemned in the bull of Greg-
</p>
<p>ory XV. in 1622, yet, before 1655, the priests had in-
</p>
<p>vented a way of evading them all ! For though all who
</p>
<p>solicited females in confession were to be reported to the
</p>
<p>Inquisition, yet the discovery was made that to give a love
</p>
<p>letter in the confessional, to be read after confession, was
</p>
<p>not to solicit in confession, and was not therefore to bo
</p>
<p>reported. Admirable sagacity ! wonderful discrimina-
</p>
<p>tion ! "What cobwebs are laws against the momentum of
</p>
<p>depraved desires 1 By this subtle distinction, till at last

<p>the pope condemned it, the whole field was again cleared

<p>nineteen, each in its turn would light up a new lamp to

<p>of them, intended to unfold the abominations of the con-
</p>
<p>BISHOP KENRICK'S DEFENCE. 187
</p>
<p>fessional ; yet they have done it in the clearest and most
</p>
<p>ample manner. Well does Professor Smyth say of con-
</p>
<p>clusions thus derived, that they are " more certain and
</p>
<p>important than can in any other way be obtained."
</p>
<p>Let us, then, proceed in our examination of Bishop Ken-
</p>
<p>rick for new light on the abominations of the confessional.
</p>
<p>The third case under the fourth head is as follows :
</p>
<p>" Qui autem pwUa vel voce, vel signo aliquo, peccati in con.-
</p>
<p>fessione declarati memoriam refricaret, dum alias earn solidta-
</p>
<p>ret, occasione confessionis solicitasse merito censerdur, et reus
</p>
<p>foret proditi sigilli 'Whoever shall remind a female,
</p>
<p>either by word or sign, of a sin which she has revealed in
</p>
<p>confession, whilst at another time he solicits her, is justly
</p>
<p>considered as having taken an occasion to solicit from
</p>
<p>confession, and is guilty of violating the seal i. e., of
</p>
<p>secrecy.' "
</p>
<p>Here, now, how vividly do we see the effects of the con-
</p>
<p>fessional in removing all those natural and divinely or-
</p>
<p>dained obstacles to impure conversation between a priest
</p>
<p>and the females of his flock which are the safeguard of
</p>
<p>social purity ! If the natural laws of female modesty
</p>
<p>were left to operate in full force, and the priest had no
</p>
<p>religious pretext for introducing sensual ideas, who does
</p>
<p>not see what powerful obstacles would exist to the intro-
</p>
<p>duction of impure conversation ? The natural modesty,
</p>
<p>both of the female mind and of an uncorrupted priest,
</p>
<p>would prevent.
</p>
<p>But here the accursed system of the confessional inter-
</p>
<p>poses, and, under a pretence of religion, introduces a reg-
</p>
<p>ular conversation at stated intervals between the priest
</p>
<p>and every female of his flock on all topics involved in
</p>
<p>the violation of chastity, in thought, word, and deed.
</p>
<p>Thus the subject is introduced thus it is kept up before

</p>
<p>the mind. There is not a female with whom the priest
</p>
<p>188 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>has not conversed upon it. He knows the depraved de-
</p>
<p>sires, the sinful feelings, the corrupt wishes, the unclean
</p>
<p>acts of all.
</p>
<p>And now the fiery oven of temptation is heated and
</p>
<p>continually burns around him. His own passions are
</p>
<p>aroused. He knows how to wake up in others all those
</p>
<p>trains of thought that lead to temptation ; he knows how
</p>
<p>to appeal to the consciousness of the female mind by signs
</p>
<p>recalling the disclosures of the confessional. And now,
</p>
<p>forsooth, what is to stop him ? "Why, truly, Bishop Ken-
</p>
<p>rick tells us that, if he does, it is the female's duty to re-
</p>
<p>port him to the Inquisition, or, if there is none in that
</p>
<p>part of the world, to the bishop, and most severe punish-
</p>
<p>ments shall be inflicted on him. "We shall speak of this
</p>
<p>soon* But first let us notice another case.
</p>
<p>It is a case of solicitation under pretext of confession.
</p>
<p>Kenrick, p. 237, vol. iii. : " Si autem Me suggesserit ei
</p>
<p>renuenti obfarrue periculum, ut eum prcetextu c&nfessi&nis ac-
</p>
<p>cerseret, denuntiandus foret, quippe qui revera prcctextu confes-
</p>
<p>sionis solidtavit ' If a priest suggests to a female re-
</p>
<p>fusing to comply with his desires, on account of exposing
</p>
<p>her reputation to peril, that she should send for him un-
</p>
<p>der a pretext of desiring to confess to him, he is to be
</p>
<p>regarded as soliciting under pretext of confession.' "
</p>
<p>What power of seduction does this statement develop in
</p>
<p>the system ! what facts does it imply !
</p>
<p>Now, compare with this legislation of the Romish pon-
</p>
<p>tiff the following statements from a French priest of whom
</p>
<p>I shall soon speak. They reveal the state of society
</p>
<p>which the legislation implies :
</p>
<p>" There are no means which their cunning does not in-
</p>
<p>vent to meet with their victims If the husband is jeal-
</p>
<p>ous and suspicious, his wife, upon the advice of the curate,

</p>
<p>will feign to be sick ; and it is the duty of a priest to
</p>
<p>BISHOP KENEICK'S DEFENCE. 189
</p>
<p>visit often (every day if possible) his sick parishioners.
</p>
<p>He will remain alone with her, to speak about spiritual
</p>
<p>matters in appearance or to confess her."
</p>
<p>Take anoth'er case from the same author, still further
</p>
<p>illustrating the immense power of seduction given by the
</p>
<p>system of the confessional to the Romish priesthood :
</p>
<p>"By this way, through their dark ministry, they have
</p>
<p>an immense power upon the minds of women ; for they at-
</p>
<p>tack only those whose disposition they have long studied
</p>
<p>in confession. The reader can have some just idea of
</p>
<p>this power from this single fact, of which I know the per-
</p>
<p>sonage, because it became public. A priest in a parish not
</p>
<p>far*from mine laid his snares for a young married woman
</p>
<p>who had the reputation of piety because she attended
</p>
<p>mass every morning. He, through his diabolical argu-
</p>
<p>ments, won her and triumphed over all her scruples. She
</p>
<p>went to him almost every morning in the vestry before
</p>
<p>the bell rung to call the people to the mass. He then
</p>
<p>confessed and absolved her, and she received the Lord's
</p>
<p>supper at his mass. The good people said, admiring her
</p>
<p>daily communion, ' How pious is this young wife ! She
</p>
<p>partakes of the sacrament every day ; she is doubtless a
</p>
<p>saint.' "
</p>
<p>Now, it is in vain to reply to such facts that all systems
</p>
<p>are liable to abus6 ; for the system of the celibacy of
</p>
<p>the clergy and of the confessional, taken together, is as
</p>
<p>exactly fitted to produce such results as if it was
</p>
<p>framed for it. What mockery, then, to pretend to check
</p>
<p>its operation by requiring females to report to the Inqui-
</p>
<p>sition those priests who solicit them, and denouncing se-
</p>
<p>vere punishments on the guilty solicitors I All such legis-
</p>
<p>lation will ever be in practice a dead letter. The diffi-
</p>
<p>culties in the way of its execution are insurmountable.
</p>
<p>Notice a few facts.

<p>No priest can be convicted and punished on the testi-

</p>
<p>/
</p>
<p>mony of one witness. Listen to Bishop Kenrick : " JVemo
</p>
<p>damnandus est gravissimis ittis pcenis ob unius denunciationem
</p>
<p>' No one is to be condemned to those most severe pun-
</p>
<p>ishments on the accusation of one -witness.' " Does the
</p>
<p>female run no risk if she fails of proving her charge ?
</p>
<p>Hear the bishop again : " Calumniam autem impactam
</p>
<p>sacerdotibus innoxiis ulcisci voluit 'It is the pleasure
</p>
<p>of the pope that false charges against innocent priests
</p>
<p>shall subject the accuser to deserved retribution.' "
</p>
<p>How easy, then, is it for a wily priest so to conduct his
</p>
<p>solicitations that no single female shall ever dare to
</p>
<p>make the charge ! and how unequal the conflict between
</p>
<p>a defenceless female and a crafty priest in a case where
</p>
<p>every instinct of self-preservation calls on him to destroy
</p>
<p>her character in order to save his own !
</p>
<p>But suppose the facts so notorious that witnesses
</p>
<p>enough could be produced to prove the charges ; will the
</p>
<p>laws be executed then? Ask Seville. "When the terrors
</p>
<p>of the Inquisition were put forth to compel females to
</p>
<p>speak the truth, the fair informers, according to Gonsal-
</p>
<p>vus, were so numerous that all the inquisitors and twenty
</p>
<p>notaries were insufficient in thirty days to take their
</p>
<p>depositions. Thirty additional days were needed three
</p>
<p>times in succession. Finally the multitude of criminals,
</p>
<p>the jealousy of husbands, the odium fast coming on auric-

<p>ular confession and the Popish priesthood caused the In-

<p>CHAPTER VIII.
</p>
<p>TESTIMONY OF CATHOLIC PRIESTS.
</p>
<p>WE have taken some notice of the efforts of Bishop
</p>
<p>Kenrick to gloss over the abominations of the system of
</p>
<p>auricular confession to an unmarried priesthood. All the
</p>
<p>laws of cause and effect must be abolished if such a sys-
</p>
<p>tem does not produce deep moral corruption. The attempt
</p>
<p>in Spain, through the Inquisition, to stop seduction through
</p>
<p>the confessional failed simply because the number of ec-
</p>
<p>clesiastics involved was so great that to proceed involved
</p>
<p>the ruin of the clergy. The facts have been given in a
</p>
<p>preceding chapter ; and to it we refer our readers. We
</p>
<p>have also produced some astounding evidence to the same
</p>
<p>effect from Bishop Kenrick himself. To this we will add
</p>
<p>the testimony of a French priest fully and practically ac-
</p>
<p>quainted with the system, for whose character and integ-
</p>
<p>rity Professor Morse, of New York, is voucher, under
</p>
<p>whose sanction the statements were published. Of him
</p>
<p>he says,
</p>
<p>" The question will naturally be asked, ' Why does the
</p>
<p>author conceal his name ? ' Reasons of prudence in con-
</p>
<p>sulting the safety of dear relatives, all Catholics in the
</p>
<p>south part of France, where they are surrounded by a
</p>
<p>bigoted, enslaved, and most vindictive Roman Catholic
</p>
<p>population, (as any one acquainted with the state of that
</p>
<p>part of France well knows,) oblige the considerate and
</p>
<p>truly amiable author to preserve for the present a strict

</p>
<p>incognito. His friends would suffer on his account the
</p>
<p>most painful proscription. Little do we conceive the dan-
</p>
<p>gers and trials, the hate and persecutions, which in our
</p>
<p>own times await not merely the convert himself from Po-
</p>
<p>pery in countries where it is dominant, but which pursue
</p>
<p>even the innocent relatives of the apostate heretic as he is
</p>
<p>called, although they remain stanch in their attachment
</p>
<p>to their sect. Would they who inconsiderately affirm that
</p>
<p>Popery has changed its persecuting character in modern
</p>
<p>times but give a moderate share of attention in ascertain-
</p>
<p>ing the facts which are every day occurring to prove its
</p>
<p>true spirit, they would no longer be deceived, but watch
</p>
<p>with the greater jealous}' all the movements and encroach-
</p>
<p>ments of this necessarily intolerant sect.
</p>
<p>" The public may rest assured that the author is what
</p>
<p>he professes to be. He is no fictitious character. He is
</p>
<p>personally known, not alone to me, but to several gentle-
</p>
<p>men whose names and standing are well known to the
</p>
<p>community. His testimonials which he showed me are of
</p>
<p>the highest character ; and he was, when in France, under
</p>
<p>the patronage of a French nobleman distinguished for his
</p>
<p>liberality and philanthropy, whose name is associated in
</p>
<p>Paris with plans of the most enlarged benevolence, whose
</p>
<p>time and immense wealth are freely employed in the en-
</p>
<p>couragement of industry, religion, and literature among
</p>
<p>the French people, but whose name, for reasons obvious
</p>
<p>to all, cannot now be given to the public."
</p>
<p>His statements are a striking commentary on the great
</p>
<p>development in Spain. There is in them an inherent veri-
</p>
<p>similitude. They reveal the course of events that dis-
</p>
<p>closed itself in those notorious results. The Catholic
</p>
<p>priest says of himself, also, that he fell in love with one
</p>
<p>of his flock, but concealed his passion, and after his con-
</p>
<p>version fled to this country. We give his statement :

<p>" It is not my intention to repeat here all the accusa-
</p>
<p>tions so justly made against Catholic priests, -but only to
</p>
<p>reveal, to publish in the light, perhaps for the first time,
</p>
<p>how they defraud the poor deluded people who trust to
</p>
<p>TESTIMONY OP CATHOLIC PRIESTS. 193
</p>
<p>ihem. I am bold to say aloud, that Protestants have noth-
</p>
<p>ing yet upon this important matter so precise as what I am
</p>
<p>about to say. I have confessed priests and laymen of
</p>
<p>every description, a bishop (once,) superiors, curates, per-
</p>
<p>sons high and low, women, girls, boys. I am therefore
</p>
<p>fitted to speak of the confessional.
</p>
<p>" The confession of men is a matter of high importance
</p>
<p>in political matters, to impress their minds with slavish
</p>
<p>ideas ; but, not to repeat what I have already stated on
</p>
<p>this subject in my discourse, I refer the reader to it. As.
</p>
<p>for other matters, confessors endeavor to give a high opin-
</p>
<p>ion of their own holiness to fathers and husbands, that
</p>
<p>they may be induced to send to the confessional, without
</p>
<p>any fear, their wives and daughters ; because, doubtless,
</p>
<p>should fathers and husbands know what passes at the con-
</p>
<p>fession box between the holy man and their wives and
</p>
<p>daughters, they never would permit them again to go to
</p>
<p>those schools of vice. But priests command most careful-
</p>
<p>ly to women never to speak of their confession to men,
</p>
<p>and they inquire severally about that in every confession.
</p>
<p>" The confession of the female sex is the great triumph,
</p>
<p>the most splendid theatre, of priests. Here is completed
</p>
<p>the work which is but begun through all their intercourse
</p>
<p>with women. ; for all our relations with them begin from
</p>
<p>their birth and continue till their death. In their baptism
</p>
<p>we sprinkle their heads with holy water, at their death their
</p>
<p>grave ; and the space comprised between those two epochs
</p>
<p>is filled by a thousand ecclesiastical duties. The more I
</p>
<p>think of this matter, the more I remember this sentence :
</p>
<p>' Priests, in taking the vows of renouncing marriage, en-
</p>
<p>gage themselves to take the wives of others.'
</p>
<p>" So soon as the first light of reason has appeared in
</p>
<p>their tender minds, we have girls at our confessional ; and
</p>
<p>here, with all the resources of cunning and lessons of the-

</p>
<p>ology, we sow the seeds of our future power in their hearts,
</p>
<p>the foundation of our future designs. Those young girls
</p>
<p>from seven years of age come and kneel with all the inno-
</p>
<p>cence, the purity, the inexperience of childhood, beautiful
</p>
<p>as the lilies of the valley of which our Savior speaks in the
</p>
<p>gospel ; they come, sent by their mothers, by the orders of
</p>
<p>the priest, who watches his prey with eager eyes ; they
</p>
<p>17
</p>
<p>194 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>come with all the fear and respect of their age for the man
</p>
<p>of God. He, seeing in them the future tool of his passions,
</p>
<p>fills their minds with prejudices, repeats to them that he is
</p>
<p>the minister of Heaven, that they must look to him, revere
</p>
<p>him, almost worship him as a god ; he accustoms their
</p>
<p>mind to obey him absolutely and blindly, to believe hitn
</p>
<p>infallible in short, a divine oracle. Thus he gives to
</p>
<p>their thoughts the direction he pleases ; he prepares his
</p>
<p>batteries ; he informs them upon subjects which they ought
</p>
<p>never to know. At first they do not understand those les-
</p>
<p>sons at so early an age ; but by and by they bear their fruit
</p>
<p>when developed by time. Thus confessors instruct those
</p>
<p>girls from seven, or even six, years of age ; for the youngest
</p>
<p>are the best. At ten years old they come to the catechism.
</p>
<p>In those long instructions he explains diffusely, three or
</p>
<p>four times a week, the vileness and filthiness in that shame-
</p>
<p>ful book, which they learn by heart. As a preparation to
</p>
<p>the Lord's supper at the end of their year of catechism,
</p>
<p>he confesses them much oftener than usual ; they make a
</p>
<p>general review of their whole life. When he gives them
</p>
<p>the absolution which purifies their conscience and recon-
</p>
<p>ciles them to God he reveals to their mind what they owe
</p>
<p>to their confessor for such a favor. In the afternoon of
</p>
<p>this same day, at one of the most gorgeous ceremonies of
</p>
<p>the Catholic church, the general communion of boys, the
</p>
<p>confessor, at the renovation of the vows of baptism, strict-
</p>
<p>ly commands them not to neglect the holy confession, for
</p>
<p>if they do they will be lost. Thus young girls, well in-
</p>
<p>doctrinated and bound to their confessor, are not heedless
</p>
<p>enough to abandon his orders ; they come again to the
</p>
<p>confessional, through custom and habit, with the same sim-
</p>
<p>plicity, and entertaining the same respect and fear of their
</p>
<p>spiritual father, as in their childhood ; they kneel many
</p>
<p>times in the vestry, without the confessional, before a man

</p>
<p>inflamed with passions a man, perhaps, who has for a long
</p>
<p>time fought against himself, and who yet bears evil in his
</p>
<p>heart ; before a man, perhaps, who has long since prepared
</p>
<p>his work, and now is ready to profit by it ; before a man
</p>
<p>honest and pure, perhaps, at first, but who, being a man, a
</p>
<p>son of Adam, may not be able to resist the temptation.
</p>
<p>And I ask, Is it possible, humanly speaking, for him, a
</p>
<p>TESTIMONY OP CATHOLIC PEIESTS. 195
</p>
<p>priest, to remain pure, when at twenty-five or thirty years
</p>
<p>of age he is shut either in the vestry or in the confessional
</p>
<p>with a young woman who reveals to him the secrets of her
</p>
<p>heart as she knows them herself, according to our rules, so
</p>
<p>that he, the spiritual physician, may be able to see and to
</p>
<p>judge with a woman who, being herself human, and not
</p>
<p>an angel, speaks for hours to a young priest of her temp-
</p>
<p>tations, her passions, her secret thoughts, &c., and convers-
</p>
<p>ing of matters which I cannot reveal here, I say, is it
</p>
<p>possible for human virtue to keep itself pure, not only for
</p>
<p>a day, a week, a month, but during years and for the whole
</p>
<p>life?
</p>
<p>" Let not a Catholic say to me that these are the reason-
</p>
<p>ings of a corrupt man, of a bad priest ; let him not say that
</p>
<p>God can do what man cannot, and other similar reasons
</p>
<p>which, / know it well, priests always give to explain their
</p>
<p>pretended virtue. Those reasons a common Catholic may
</p>
<p>be satisfied with ; but I, a priest, cannot be. No ; I can-
</p>
<p>not ; I know too well the matter ; and I answer, first, that
</p>
<p>I was no more inclined to evil, nor more liable to yield to
</p>
<p>temptation, than others ; (for God knows that I never se-
</p>
<p>duced any one through my ministry.) I was only a man
</p>
<p>like others, designed by the Creator for connubial happi-
</p>
<p>ness according to his word itself: 'It is not good for man
</p>
<p>to be alone ; I will make a helpmeet for him ; ' designed, I
</p>
<p>say, for a union intended by the all-wise and benevolent
</p>
<p>Creator. Can the laws of Popery prevail over the wis-
</p>
<p>dom of the Almighty ? Let not a Catholic say that a
</p>
<p>priest in this situation is helped by the special grace of
</p>
<p>God ; for I answer, by the words of Christ himself, ' Who-
</p>
<p>soever loves danger, he shall perish in it.' And if God
</p>
<p>has promised his grace, it is not granted in an unnatural,
</p>
<p>immoral situation, directly against his institution.
</p>
<p>" As soon as the young girl, for I speak peculiarly of

<p>their confession, enters the confessional, ' Bless me, father/
</p>
<p>she says, kneeling and crossing herself, ' for I have sinned ; '
</p>
<p>and the priest mumbles, Dominus sit in ore tuo et in corde,
</p>
<p>tuo ut conjitearis omnia peccata tua 'The Lord be in your
</p>
<p>heart and lips, that you may confess all your sins.' If she
</p>
<p>is an ugly, common country girl or woman she is soon de-
</p>

</p>
<p>the holy father puts himself at ease ; he examines her in the
</p>
<p>most secret recesses of her soul ; he unfolds her mind in
</p>
<p>every sense, in every manner, upon every matter. This is
</p>
<p>the way which theology recommends us to follow in our
</p>
<p>interrogations: ' Daughter, have you had bad thoughts?'
</p>
<p>' On what subject ? How often ? ' &c. ' Have you had bad
</p>
<p>desires ? What desires ? ' ' Have you committed bad ac-
</p>
<p>tions? With whom ? What actions?' &c. I am obliged
</p>
<p>to stop. Many times the poor ashamed girl does not dare
</p>
<p>answer the questions, they are so indecent. In that case
</p>
<p>the holy man, ceasing his interrogations, says to her, ' Lis-
</p>
<p>ten, daughter, to the true doctrine of the church ; you must
</p>
<p>confess the truth, all the truth, to your spiritual father.
</p>
<p>Do you' know that I am in the place of God that you
</p>
<p>cannot deceive him? Speak, then ; reveal your heart to
</p>
<p>me as God knows it ; you will be very glad when you will
</p>
<p>have discharged this burden from your rnind. Will you
</p>
<p>not ? ' ' Yes.' ' Begin ; I will help you ; ' and then begins
</p>
<p>such a diabolical explanation as is not to be found but in
</p>
<p>houses of infamy, I suppose, or in our theological books.
</p>
<p>This is so well known that I have often heard of wicked
</p>
<p>young men saying to each other, ' Come, let us go to con-
</p>
<p>fession, and the curate will teach us a great many corrupt
</p>
<p>things which we never knew ; ' and many young girls have
</p>
<p>told me in confession, that, in order to become acquainted
</p>
<p>with details on those matters pleasing to their corrupt na-
</p>
<p>ture, they went purposely to the confessional to speak about
</p>
<p>it to their spiritual father. Sometimes I have heard the
</p>
<p>confession of young girls not above sixteen years of age,
</p>
<p>who explained to me such disgusting things with a pre-
</p>
<p>cision, a propriety (or rather impropriety) of terms, that,
</p>
<p>when I asked them where they had gathered all this
</p>
<p>strange learning, they seemed as much astonished at my
</p>
<p>question as I was at their confession, and said to me,

</p>
<p>' Why, father, our former confessor taught us all this, and
</p>
<p>commanded us never to omit these details, otherwise we
</p>
<p>should be damned.' I replied to them, ' I pray you never
</p>
<p>use such terms again ; they are unworthy of a Christian
</p>
<p>mouth ; you have misunderstood your confessor.' I learned
</p>
<p>afterwards that these misguided persons left my confes-

<p>who did not confess like others, and who did not cause them to
</p>
<p>say all.
</p>
<p>"After so many instructions the young girl is well in-
</p>
<p>doctrinated, well fitted to answer either the questions or
</p>
<p>the purposes of the priest. This poison diffused in her
</p>
<p>heart soon infects her whole mind and destroys her purity.
</p>
<p>It is precisely at such a point of time that her cruel foe
</p>
<p>waits for her. When he sees that she is made vicious and
</p>
<p>corrupt by the teachings of the confessional he is sure of
</p>
<p>his success."
</p>
<p>To this statement Professor Morse adds the following
</p>
<p>remarks :
</p>
<p>" The modes by which the priest persuades his victim
</p>
<p>that she is without sin in doing whatever he commands,
</p>
<p>since he is responsible, and since he can absolve her from
</p>
<p>it, and other means of deceiving at the confessional, are
</p>
<p>then too graphically related to be publicly told ; and I
</p>
<p>have thought it best, with the consent of the author, to
</p>
<p>suppress all but the closing facts."
</p>
<p>Now, let it be considered that I have shown that from
</p>
<p>Bishop Kenrick himself evidence can be derived going to
</p>
<p>confirm and substantiate all the statements of this French
</p>
<p>priest. If these things are so, then it becomes Americans
</p>
<p>to look well to this matter.
</p>
<p>Let no one trust the efficacy of Papal prohibitory laws.
</p>
<p>The whole system scatters broadcast the seeds of the
</p>
<p>highest temptation known to man in the minds of the
</p>
<p>whole priesthood, and then waters those seeds day and
</p>
<p>night ; and then, as if in solemn mockery, or in bitter de-
</p>
<p>rision of the interests of the human race, the pope issues
</p>
<p>his bull and forbids them to spring up and grow.
</p>
<p>If the human mind had not been debased, brutalized, and
</p>
<p>crushed by the system, it would be incredible that it could
</p>
<p>have been endured from generation to generation. If the

<p>whole skill of earth and hell had been put forth to devise
</p>
<p>198 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>a system designed first to corrupt the clergy, and then,
</p>
<p>through them, human society, a better devised and more
</p>
<p>effectual one could not have been found. Hence a con-
</p>
<p>verted French priest has well said, " This intercourse of
</p>
<p>young girls and young unmarried priests is the fulness of
</p>
<p>immorality." And the following account which he gives
</p>
<p>of the corruption of the French clergy is no less philo-
</p>
<p>sophical than true. It also exactly agrees with the state-
</p>
<p>ments of Blanco White.
</p>
<p>" Catholic or Protestant writers who have spoken of the
</p>
<p>corruption of the Roman clergy, who have described its
</p>
<p>matchless wickedness, have not shown its cause. They
</p>
<p>saw only the effect, without tracing it up to its source. I
</p>
<p>will try to supply their silence. I have read a certain
</p>
<p>number of those books against a body to which I be-
</p>
<p>longed, a body which I know as well as it is possible
</p>
<p>for one to know it, and I can say that its whole degra-
</p>
<p>dation is unknown. Careful of saying nothing that can
</p>
<p>shock the reader, I will reveal only what is necessary to
</p>
<p>unveil those ' anointed of the Lord,' but nothing to offend
</p>
<p>the eyes. I shall surprise Protestants, doubtless, by say-
</p>
<p>ing that, in France, the immense majority of young men in
</p>
<p>our seminaries are not corrupted, and many of them are vir-
</p>
<p>tuous. It is nevertheless true. They are ignorant, super-
</p>
<p>stitious, fanatical, given up to their superstitious practices,
</p>
<p>to theology, &c., but, I declare it, not at all vicious. That
</p>
<p>may be conceded, although in appearance in contradiction
</p>
<p>to their indecent studies ; for they are taught that it is
</p>
<p>necessary to learn all these in order to be able to fulfil
</p>
<p>their duty ; and, to hear confession in all its extent, it is
</p>
<p>necessary to know all human perversity. I do not give a
</p>
<p>judgment on these reasons ; be that as it may, our superiors
</p>
<p>endeavor to inspire us, in those recitations, with a great dis-
</p>
<p>like of such crimes ; and I can affirm that it is very pain-

</p>
<p>ful to the natural sense of decency in any man to be
</p>
<p>obliged, as we are, to be familiar with such books.
</p>
<p>" This is the true picture upon this matter of the semi-
</p>
<p>naries that I know; and I am indifferent whether it
</p>
<p>agrees or not with pictures drawn by others.
</p>
<p>TESTIMONY OF CATHOLIC PRIESTS. 199
</p>
<p>" The story of the corruption of the clergy begins only
</p>
<p>when they are out of the seminary. Those young men are
</p>
<p>sent into a parish in the quality of curates, or vicars. In
</p>
<p>the beginning they fulfil their duties with great care, and
</p>
<p>for some time remain faithful to their vows. Many told
</p>
<p>this to me after their fall ; and I have seen it myself, ex-
</p>
<p>cept in a few exceptions. But by and by they open as-
</p>
<p>tonished eyes. Restored to freedom, after ten or twelve
</p>
<p>years of thraldom in a college, or seminary, they become
</p>
<p>quite diiferent men : gradually they forget their vow.
</p>
<p>' O,' said a young priest to me, with tears in his eyes, after
</p>
<p>having four or five years discharged the duties of his sta-
</p>
<p>tion, ' God only knows what I have suffered during this
</p>
<p>time ! and if I have fallen, it is not without fighting. Had
</p>
<p>I been allowed to choose a wife as it is the law of God,
</p>
<p>who destines man to marriage, whatever our rules teach
</p>
<p>to the contrary I should have remained virtuous ; I
</p>
<p>should have been the happiest man in the world ; I should
</p>
<p>be a good, a holy priest ; while now I am 0, 1 am
</p>
<p>ashamed of myself!'
</p>
<p>" This is really the sad history of all their falls ; for, let
</p>
<p>us be just, what can become of a young priest of twenty-
</p>
<p>five years of age, confined in .the lonely wilderness of a
</p>
<p>country parish, in a village where he has only the society
</p>
<p>of his sacristan and of his servant, because all his parish-
</p>
<p>ioners being but coarse peasants, especially in the south and
</p>
<p>in the west, where scarcely any know how to read, are un-
</p>
<p>able to afford any comfort to his solitude ? His duty oc-
</p>
<p>cupies him but little save on the Sunday ; and during the
</p>
<p>whole week, after his short mass and some confession of
</p>
<p>women, he is reduced to ask himself, ' What shall I do?'
</p>
<p>Study has few, if any, charms for him, because he is forbid-
</p>
<p>den to read or study precisely those matters which enter-
</p>
<p>tain the intellect. He is allowed only to peruse theology

<p>always Dens, Gomez, Rodriguez, the Life of Saints, by
</p>
<p>Godescar. If he should obtain some other books, the
</p>
<p>bishop, in his episcopal visit, would chide him severely,
</p>
<p>and call him a worldly priest. Our great poet Racine,
</p>
<p>so pure, so chaste, is scarcely tolerated, and many bishops
</p>
<p>do not allow him in the libraries of their priests. The
</p>
<p>young man, before his profession, had imagined and antici-

</p>
<p>pated a pleasant existence in the ecclesiastical state, and
</p>
<p>he finds but privations, ennui, disgust. His passions are
</p>
<p>also raised ; the demon of bad thoughts takes possession
</p>
<p>of him. Moreover, his ministry puts him in so many cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances with ignorant young countrywomen, into whose
</p>
<p>most secret thoughts he is obliged to enter, that his virtue
</p>
<p>receives many shocks. And can it be otherwise when a
</p>
<p>man has those intimate and continual relations required
</p>
<p>of the Catholic priest with women ? No ; it would be
</p>
<p>unreasonable, to expect from human nature more than it is
</p>
<p>able to do, to put it on too difficult a trial. Such is, how-
</p>
<p>ever, the situation of every Catholic priest.
</p>
<p>" I do not say all this to veil or excuse the crimes, the
</p>
<p>natural result of this institution ; but I think I am bound
</p>
<p>to give the matter of fact as it is. Sometimes the resist-
</p>
<p>ance is firm, the struggle long ; but at length this martyr
</p>
<p>of fanaticism, this victim of his system and of his superi-
</p>
<p>ors, abandons his vow through despair, shuts his eyes, and
</p>
<p>throws himself into the slough of passions. This is the end
</p>
<p>of almost all priests. In the beginning their consciences
</p>
<p>reproach them bitterly ; they try again to be faithful ; they
</p>
<p>flutter, fall, reform again, go on, fall again, and at length, to
</p>
<p>finish this horrible struggle, remain in vice. Let us add
</p>
<p>to this sad catalogue the temptations against their faith
</p>
<p>and doctrines, which end with many in complete atheism,
</p>
<p>into which they fall by the excess of degradation, temp-
</p>
<p>tations to atheism in those who reason, from the impossi-
</p>
<p>bility of reconciling their faith with reason."
</p>
<p>I
</p>
<p>What language of detestation can be found sufficiently
</p>
<p>strong for such a system ? And yet of this system has

</p>
<p>priest is that of Blanco White, once an eminent ecclesiastic
</p>
<p>in the Spanish church. He clearly proves that there had
</p>
<p>TESTIMONY OF CATHOLIC PRIESTS. 201
</p>
<p>been there no improvement since the disclosures of the
</p>
<p>century after the reformation. He says,
</p>
<p>" I cannot think of the wanderings of the friends of my
</p>
<p>youth without heartrending pain. One now no more,
</p>
<p>whose talents raised him to one of the highest dignities
</p>
<p>of the church of Spain, was for many years a model of
</p>
<p>Christian purity. When, by the powerful influence of his
</p>
<p>mind and the warmth of his devotion, this man had drawn
</p>
<p>many into the clerical and the religious life, (my youngest
</p>
<p>sister among the latter,) he sunk at once into the grossest
</p>
<p>and most daring profligacy. I heard him boast that the
</p>
<p>night before the solemn procession of Corpus Christi,
</p>
<p>where he appeared nearly at the head of his chapter, one
</p>
<p>of two children had been born, which his two concubines
</p>
<p>brought to light within a few days of each other. Such,
</p>
<p>more or less, has been the fate of my early friends, whose
</p>
<p>minds and hearts were much above the common standard
</p>
<p>of the Spanish clergy. What, then, need I say of the vul-
</p>
<p>gar crowd of priests, who, coming, as the Spanish phrase
</p>
<p>has it, from coarse swaddling clothes, and raised by ordina-
</p>
<p>tion to a rank of life for which they have not been pre-
</p>
<p>pared, mingle vice and superstition, grossness of feeling
</p>
<p>and pride of office, in their character ? I have known the
</p>
<p>best among them ; I have heard their confessions ; I have
</p>
<p>heard the confessions of young persons of both sexes who
</p>
<p>fell under the influence of their suggestions and example ;
</p>
<p>and 1 do declare that nothing can be more dangerous to
</p>
<p>youthful virtue than their company. I have seen the most
</p>
<p>promising men of my university obtain country vicarages
</p>
<p>with characters unimpeached and hearts overflowing with
</p>
<p>hopes of usefulness. A virtuous wife would have confirmed
</p>
<p>and strengthened their purposes ; but they were to live a
</p>
<p>life of angels in celibacy. They were, however, men, and
</p>
<p>their duties connected them with beings of no higher de-

<p>scription. Young women knelt before them in all the
</p>
<p>intimacy and openness of confession. A solitary home
</p>
<p>made them go abroad in search of social converse. Love,
</p>
<p>long resisted, seized them at length like madness. Two

<p>I knew who died insane. Hundreds might be found who

<p>avoid that fate by a life of seftled systematic vice."

</p>
<p>CRUELTY OF ROMANISM.
</p>
<p>Nowhere does the cruelty of Romanism appear so in-
</p>
<p>tense as in the case of the noblest and most sincere minds
</p>
<p>of men and women who are drawn into the priesthood or
</p>
<p>into nunneries with the false idea that they are to find
</p>
<p>themselves surrounded by holy influences. How bitter
</p>
<p>their disappointment ! Some long resist temptation by a
</p>
<p>kind of living martyrdom ; and of these some become in-
</p>
<p>sane. The fate of many a poor deceived nun will never be
</p>
<p>known in all its horrors till the revelations of the judg-
</p>
<p>ment day. Whatever screams are heard, from whatever
</p>
<p>cause, as was the case in the nunnery at Baltimore, no
</p>
<p>Protestant can enter. And, if any victim escapes, she is,
</p>
<p>of course, slandered and declared insane.
</p>
<p>Few priests have the nobility and strength of character
</p>
<p>of the French priest. His experience was this, as given
</p>
<p>by himself :
</p>
<p>" An assiduous reading of pious books, of the Holy Bible,
</p>
<p>were of great use to me in confession, and gave me the
</p>
<p>reputation of an able confessor. Soon, notwithstanding,
</p>
<p>or I ought rather to say because of my youth, I became
</p>
<p>a la mode all the fashion among devotees. In France
</p>
<p>there is a 'mode,' or fashion, for every thing, for confess-
</p>
<p>ors as well as for coats or hats. My downcast eyes, my
</p>
<p>timidity and piety in saying mass, obtained for me the
</p>
<p>reputation of a pious priest. Consequently many people
</p>
<p>came to hear my sermons applied to me for my advice in
</p>
<p>confession or my prayers in the mass. I was well nigh
</p>
<p>believing myself a powerful saint, a heavenly being.
</p>
<p>Alas ! alas ! I was to be recalled from this height to which
</p>
<p>my pride had raised me, to my native earth.
</p>
<p>" My heart, in spite of my whole pretended holiness, was
</p>
<p>like mountains covered with enormous heaps of snow,
</p>
<p>where a single breath is often sufficient to bring down the

<p>terrible avalanche.
</p>
<p>TESTIMONY OF CATHOLIC PRIESTS. 203
</p>
<p>" One day a young lady came to the vestry and asked me
</p>
<p>if I would confess her. T complied with her request.
</p>
<p>I confessed her often ; for she was pious, and received the
</p>
<p>Lord's supper at least twice a week. She told me the
</p>
<p>reason why she had changed her former confessor a
</p>
<p>reason which it is not necessary here to tell. In the in-
</p>
<p>timate relation of confessor and penitent, in those repeated
</p>
<p>conversations in which a young female of nineteen opens
</p>
<p>her heart every week, in every matter and the most secret
</p>
<p>thoughts, to a young man of twenty-seven who feels and
</p>
<p>laments his loneliness, it was not difficult to foresee what
</p>
<p>would naturally happen. She spoke to me so openly, so
</p>
<p>candidly, her confession displayed so fair a character,
</p>
<p>such artlessness, so much innocence, that by and by, with-
</p>
<p>out any intention or reflection, but by a natural course of
</p>
<p>things, my heart was caught, and I fell in love with her.
</p>
<p>I took heed not to give her the least hint of it, because it
</p>
<p>was worse than useless, since I was prevented from being
</p>
<p>married by my vow, by ecclesiastic rules, and also by the
</p>
<p>laws of the state. I thought not an instant of abusing my
</p>
<p>ministry on her account ; which, however, would have been
</p>
<p>the easiest thing in the world. It remained, then, for me
</p>
<p>but to smother this involuntary love. At first I tried to
</p>
<p>believe it only the effect of my imagination too much
</p>
<p>kindled. But vain illusion ! The more I endeavored to
</p>
<p>trample down this feeling, the more I strengthened it ; and
</p>
<p>it increased every day. My virtue, indeed, could prevent
</p>
<p>me from giving my consent, but it could not prevent my
</p>
<p>suffering its effects the mental agony of the conflict.
</p>
<p>Ere long I saw the inutility of my exertions against it ;
</p>
<p>and I thought I could not do better than to resign myself
</p>
<p>to the will of God, in the hope that he would doubtless
</p>
<p>help me in my struggles, since I fought for his glory, his
</p>
<p>church, and my vows.

<p>- My first thought, of course, was of removing the dan-
</p>
<p>ger by refusing any longer to confess her by giving up
</p>
<p>the direction of her soul, so perilous was it to mine own.
</p>
<p>At first, in the next confession, I wished to sound her on
</p>
<p>this subject, alleging for that purpose some Jesuitical and
</p>
<p>apparent reason ; lor my superiors had taught me never
</p>
<p>to be at a loss for pretexts. She answered to me, ' Fa-

<p>ther, I gave you my whole confidence, I opened to you
</p>
<p>my heart, I unveiled to you my most secret thoughts with
</p>
<p>as much candor as if I was but ten years old, that you
</p>
<p>might direct me better. You know me as well as I know
</p>
<p>myself. I do not ask the reasons why you propose to me
</p>
<p>to exchange you for another. But, if you deny me your
</p>
<p>ministry, I must renounce the confession altogether ; for
</p>
<p>you know yourself why I left my former confessor ; and
</p>
<p>you will not oblige me to go back to him, neither to Mr.
</p>
<p>D., nor to Mr. L. 7
</p>
<p>" I could not tell her the true reason of my conduct, for
</p>
<p>my sake and for her own. On the other side I was very
</p>
<p>superstitious, believing, heartily, confession quite necessary
</p>
<p>to the salvation of the soul. Could I then, with my ideas
</p>
<p>of confession, assent to the loss of her soul ? I remem-
</p>
<p>bered that a true priest ought ever to expose his own
</p>
<p>salvation for the sake of others ; and consequently the
</p>
<p>design of sending her to another seemed a horrible tempta-
</p>

</p>
<p>tance I feared to direct myself ; and as in the seminary I
</p>
<p>had been told a hundred times that our confessor ought to
</p>
<p>rule all our business, I went to him ; I looked to him as to
</p>
<p>my father and the representative of God ; for I practised
</p>
<p>what I taught others viz., that the confessor is the vice-
</p>
<p>gerent of God. He listened to my singular declaration
</p>
<p>and to my purpose of renouncing her confession if lie
</p>
<p>thought best. He laughed at rne ; and, notwithstanding
</p>
<p>all my explanations, he could not, or would not, understand
</p>
<p>me, and at length told me that my love for her was far
</p>
<p>from being a reason of depriving her of my ministry.
</p>
<p>" There then remained no doubt in my own mind ; and I
</p>
<p>thought that God himself had ordered it so. But, to di-
</p>
<p>minish the danger, 1 resolved to avoid any intercourse

<p>with her except in the confessional ; and henceforth I

<p>ceased to pay any visit to her family, where I went before,
</p>
<p>oftentimes to evening parties, for fear of seeing her and
</p>
<p>increasing my fatal attachment ; for the Holy Bible says,
</p>
<p>Quisquis amat periculum in illo peribit ' Whosoever loves
</p>

</p>
<p>sudden desertion, and especially her mother, asked me
</p>
<p>why I had deserted their house if they had offended me.

</p>
<p>Thanks to my subterfuges, I avoided the question ; and
</p>
<p>thus I. who would have found my joy, my happiness, in this
</p>
<p>house, banished myself from the family where all the de-
</p>
<p>sires of my heart carried me.
</p>
<p>" In speaking of what I suffered in repressing my feel-

</p>
<p>who put their hearts in open air, who act unreservedly,
</p>
<p>who obey the just dictates of Nature instead of having
</p>
<p>been inured to despise them and trample upon them by
</p>
<p>men to whom the lake of great emotions is always drained,
</p>
<p>because they do not subvert the sacred institutions of their
</p>
<p>Creator. These men know not with what violence this
</p>
<p>sea of human passion ferments, gushes out, when every
</p>
<p>issue is denied to it ; how it increases, swells, overflows,

<p>for itself a channel."

<p>for death in attending on the victims of a pestilential dis-

</p>
<p>tious and mercenary character of the clergy and was rid-
</p>
<p>iculed for his scrupulous conscientiousness ; how he was
</p>
<p>tempted to infidelity and atheism ; how by the Bible he
</p>
<p>was brought truly to know God and spiritual religion ; and,
</p>
<p>finall}', how he escaped to this country without disclosing
</p>
<p>his feelings to the object of his affection.

<p>I rejoice to believe that even in Papal countries there

<p>are some such in all ages whom the cruel system does not

<p>CHAPTER IX.
</p>
<p>THE RESULT.
</p>
<p>To conclude, it must now be added that there is no reason
</p>
<p>to doubt that the intelligent and leading managers of the
</p>
<p>Romish corporation, as was the case with ./Eneas Sylvius
</p>
<p>and John Gerson, know this to be the real state of the
</p>
<p>case, and have adapted their policy to the expectation of
</p>
<p>its permanent continuance. There is no reason to regard
</p>
<p>them as sincerely deluded, as were the early originators
</p>
<p>of the doctrine of celibacy. It is no doubt true that the
</p>
<p>celibacy of the clergy was introduced early into the
</p>
<p>church by men who, under the influence of prevailing
</p>
<p>errors, supposed it essential to the highest degree of holi-
</p>
<p>ness. Moreover for a time it was probably maintained
</p>
<p>in innocence and sincerity, notwithstanding it began im-
</p>
<p>mediately to develop its corrupting influences, on the
</p>
<p>ground that these were but the abuses of a good thing.
</p>
<p>But the time in which this has been innocently possible
</p>
<p>has long since passed away. So constant, so uniform, so
</p>
<p>fearful is the testimony of experience that I do not hesi-
</p>
<p>tate to say that the more intelligent part of the Romish cor-
</p>
<p>poration, or at least those who stand nearest to the centre
</p>
<p>of power, know perfectly well that all that has been
</p>
<p>stated by me and others on this subject is no exaggera-
</p>
<p>tion. Nay, they well know that it falls short of the truth,

</p>
<p>and look with contempt upon the easy simplicity of those
</p>
<p>Protestants who are duped by their impudent representa-
</p>
<p>tions of the holiness of the priesthood.
</p>
<p>If, then, any one should ask, How do they look on the
</p>
<p>matter ? I reply, They expect that, in all communities where
</p>
<p>their system has the ascendency, the great majority of the
</p>
<p>clergy of all grades will not be continent ; and they have
</p>
<p>adjusted their morals so as to accord with this state of
</p>
<p>things.
</p>
<p>I desire to be distinctly understood. I do not mean by
</p>
<p>this that they cease to teach the superior sanctity of celi-
</p>
<p>bacy and continence, or to claim for their church superior
</p>
<p>sanctity on this ground, or to represent the Protestant
</p>
<p>clergy who have wives as sensual and unholy. All this is
</p>
<p>necessary to preserve appearances, and is perfectly well
</p>
<p>understood among the knowing ones. Those who have
</p>
<p>just come from the very depths of pollution and sensual-
</p>
<p>ism do not at all hesitate to speak thus.
</p>
<p>If any say that this implies an inconceivable degree of
</p>
<p>baseness, and hypocrisy, and unprincipled deceit, I answer,
</p>
<p>It is no more than has notoriously existed in many of those
</p>
<p>who stand at the very head of the system that is, the
</p>
<p>popes. Many of them have been known to be the most
</p>
<p>licentious wretches that have ever burdened this earth ;
</p>
<p>and yet, in all their bulls they assume the character of
</p>
<p>eminent saints, the peculiar favorites of the Most High.
</p>
<p>For example, Innocent VIII., whose bull I have quoted, in
</p>
<p>which he sanctions all manner of perfidy towards the poor
</p>
<p>and holy Waldenses, led a most profligate life. It is a
</p>
<p>matter of dispute how many illegitimate children he had
</p>
<p>Onuphrius stating in general that he had several, Marullus
</p>
<p>fixing the number at sixteen. Certainly, although a num-
</p>
<p>ber of them died, two survived his accession to the Papacy,

</p>
<p>and enriched by him. Indeed it is notorious that the same
</p>
<p>things were done by many other popes, so that they even
</p>
<p>ceased to excite surprise. Yet all these popes addressed
</p>
<p>the church and the world as if they were the very choicest
</p>
<p>saints of God, even when they wre rallying their myr-
</p>
<p>midons perfidiously to massacre the purest saints on earth.
</p>
<p>What they mean by holiness we can understand when we
</p>
<p>recollect that they call such butcheries " a holy work," and
</p>
<p>are not at all troubled by the loathsome pollution of such
</p>
<p>lives.
</p>
<p>Such are the men whom the pen of inspiration has viv-
</p>
<p>idly and indignantly described as " speaking lies in hypoc-
</p>
<p>risy, having their consciences seared as with a hot iron." But
</p>
<p>the system of the Romish church is exactly adapted to
</p>
<p>transform her clergy into such men, and to finish the work
</p>
<p>by making them infidels or atheists.
</p>
<p>If any simple and charitable souls, or any under the
</p>
<p>influence of affected candor and liberality, shall call this
</p>
<p>language harsh and uncharitable, I will only ask of them
</p>
<p>for themselves to read the testimony of the Roman Cath-
</p>
<p>olic councils and historians in the ages preceding the
</p>
<p>reformation, when Protestantism was unknown. I defy
</p>
<p>any man even to imagine a state of things so bad as is
</p>
<p>there described and proved by evidence of the most in-
</p>
<p>controvertible kind.
</p>
<p>And yet, even after the reformation, in the council of
</p>
<p>Trent, when such facts were urged on the Papal corpora-
</p>
<p>tion by Roman Catholic rulers as a reason for repealing
</p>
<p>the law of celibacy, they refused merely on grounds of
</p>
<p>Papal policy. On this point Edgar states the following
</p>
<p>impressive facts :
</p>
<p>" Albert, Duke of Bavaria, in 1562, by Augustine, his
</p>
<p>ambassador, depicted in glowing colors, before the council

</p>
<p>of Trent, the licentiousness of the German priesthood.
</p>
<p>THE RESULT. 209
</p>
<p>The contagion of heresy, the ambassador said, had, on ac-
</p>
<p>count of sacerdotal profligacy, pervaded the* people of
</p>
<p>Bavaria even to the nobility. A recital of clerical crim-
</p>
<p>inality would wound the ear of chastity. Debauchery had
</p>
<p>covered the ecclesiastics with infamy. A hundred priests,
</p>
<p>so general was the contagion, could hardly muster three
</p>
<p>or four who obeyed the injunctions of chastity. The
</p>
<p>French applauded the ambassador's speech. The council
</p>
<p>also, by its promoter, joined in the French eulogy, and
</p>
<p>styled the Duke of Bavaria the bulwark of the popedom.
</p>
<p>"The Emperor Ferdinand, though without success, ap-
</p>
<p>plied to the pope, in 1564, for a repeal of the laws against
</p>
<p>sacerdotal matrimony. Maximilian also, with many of
</p>
<p>the German princes, importuned Pius IV. for the same
</p>
<p>purpose. The reason urged by the emperor was the
</p>
<p>profligacy of the priesthood. His majesty declared that
</p>
<p>among many of the clergy scarcely one could be found
</p>
<p>who lived in chastity. All, with hardly an exception,
</p>
<p>were public fornicators, to the greatest danger of souls
</p>
<p>and scandal of the people. A repeal of clerical celibacy,
</p>
<p>Maximilian stated, would gratify the populace of Bavaria,
</p>
<p>Bohemia, Silesia, Moravia, Austria, Cariuthia, Carniola,
</p>
<p>and Hungary. All these vast regions would have rejoiced
</p>
<p>in the restoration of marriage among the clergy.
</p>
<p>" The emperor's application was supported by the Popish
</p>
<p>priesthood of Germany. These, in maintenance of their
</p>
<p>petition, alleged various reasons. The frailty of man ;
</p>
<p>the difficulty of abstinence ; the strength of the passion
</p>
<p>that prompts to marriage ; the permission of clerical wed-
</p>
<p>lock by the Old and New Testaments under the Jewish
</p>
<p>and Christian dispensations ; its use, with few exceptions,
</p>
<p>by the apostles ; the instructions of Dionysius to Piny-
</p>
<p>tus ; the decision of the Xicene council, suggested by
</p>
<p>Paphnutius ; the usage of the Greeks and Latins in the

<p>east and west till the popedom of Calixtus, all these
</p>
<p>arguments the German ecclesiastics urged for the lawful-
</p>
<p>ness of sacerdotal matrimony. A second reason the Ger-
</p>
<p>mans deduced from clerical profligacy. Fifty priests,
</p>
<p>these churchmen confessed, could with difficulty afford one
</p>
<p>who was not a notorious fornicator, to the offence of the
</p>
<p>people and the injury of piety. Sacerdotal logic and

<p>210 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>learning, however, were unavailing when weighed against
</p>
<p>pontifical policy and ecclesiastical utility."
</p>
<p>If we would understand what this ecclesiastical utility
</p>
<p>is, attend to the Romish theory as reported by Edgar :
</p>
<p>" Cardinal Rodolf, arguing in a Roman consistory in
</p>
<p>favor of clerical celibacy, affirmed that the priesthood, if
</p>
<p>allowed to marry, would transfer their attachment from
</p>
<p>the pope to their family and prince ; and this would tend
</p>
<p>to the injury of the ecclesiastical community. The holy
</p>
<p>see, the cardinal alleged, would, by this means, be soon
</p>
<p>limited to the Roman city. The Transalpine party in the
</p>
<p>council of Trent used the same argument. The introduc-
</p>
<p>tion of priestly matrimony, this faction urged, would sever
</p>
<p>the clergy from their close dependence on the popedom
</p>
<p>and turn their affections to their family, and consequently
</p>
<p>to their king and country. Marriage connects men with
</p>
<p>their sovereign and with the land of their nativity. Cel-
</p>
<p>ibacy, on the contrary, transfers the attention of the clergy
</p>
<p>from his majesty and the state to his holiness and the
</p>
<p>Church. The man who has a wife and children is bound
</p>
<p>by conjugal and paternal attachment to his country, and
</p>
<p>feels the warmest glow of parental love, mingled with the
</p>
<p>flame of patriotism. His interests and affections are in-
</p>
<p>twined with the honor and prosperity of his native land ;
</p>
<p>and this, in consequence, he will prefer to the aggrandize-
</p>
<p>ment of the Romish hierarchy or the grandeur of the
</p>
<p>Roman pontiff. The dearest objects of his heart are em-
</p>
<p>braced in the soil that gave them birth, the people among
</p>
<p>whom they live, and the government that affords them
</p>
<p>projection. Celibacy, on the contrary, precludes all these
</p>
<p>engagements, and directs the undivided affections of the
</p>
<p>priesthood to the church and its ecclesiastical sovereign.
</p>
<p>The clergy become dependent on the pope rather than on
</p>
<p>their king, and endeavor to promote the prosperity of the

<p>Papacy rather than their country. Such are not linked
</p>
<p>with the state by an offspring whose happiness is involved
</p>
<p>in the prosperity of the nation. Gregory VII., accord-
</p>
<p>ingly, the great enemy of kings, was the distinguished
</p>
<p>patron of sacerdotal celibacy."
</p>
<p>THE RESULT. 211
</p>
<p>Here then, as before, in the case of lying, perjury, and
</p>
<p>murder, the Romish corporation deem universal pollution
</p>
<p>and corruption a less evil than the loss of their own
</p>
<p>usurped supremacy. If peculiar wrath and uncommon
</p>
<p>plagues are reserved by God for any class of men, surely
</p>
<p>it must be for such as these.
</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL CHARGES.
</p>
<p>What has been said may seem sufficient to prove that
</p>
<p>Romanism is the enemy of man. It is sufficient ; and yet
</p>
<p>it is far from exhausting the evidence that exists, and which
</p>
<p>must be considered in order to gain a full understanding
</p>
<p>of the magnitude of the interests involved in the great
</p>
<p>question now at issue in this nation and in the Christian
</p>
<p>world.
</p>
<p>It is not possible, however, advantageously to present
</p>
<p>some portions of the remaining argument until we have
</p>
<p>considered the evidence which exists that the Romish cor-

<p>PRESUMPTIVE EVIDENCE OF THE FACT.
</p>
<p>IT has been seen that the Romish corporation places it-
</p>
<p>self in such an attitude that it is practically the god of
</p>
<p>this world. It has an entire monopoly of the grace of
</p>
<p>God and of the word of God. God is invisible and inac-
</p>
<p>cessible except through the mediation of this corporation.
</p>
<p>Such a claim ought to be sustained by an amount and
</p>
<p>a clearness of evidence corresponding with its impor-
</p>
<p>tance. It is estimated that Rome has shed the blood of
</p>
<p>at least fifty millions of Christians for refusing to admit
</p>
<p>these claims ; it appears also that she still defends her
</p>
<p>past course, and would repeat the slaughters if she had
</p>
<p>the power.
</p>
<p>Has she, then, even a plausible ground for her lofty
</p>
<p>claims? I answer, No. The presumption on a general
</p>
<p>view of the facts of the case is against her ; and a fair
</p>
<p>examination of the records of history and of inspiration

</p>
<p>is all that is needed to expose her as the great mother
</p>
<p>of imposture and forgery.
</p>
<p>PRESUMPTION AGAINST ROME, FROM HER SANCTION OF LYING.
</p>
<p>The first presumptive argument against the members
</p>
<p>of the Romish corporation arises from the fact that their
</p>
<p>theory of morals is such on the subject of veracity and
</p>
<p>fidelity that it is highly improbable that they have not
</p>
<p>used forgery and fraud in obtaining their present position
</p>
<p>and power. It appears that it'is a fundamental part of
</p>
<p>their morals that the interests of that corporation are of
</p>
<p>more importance than truth or fidelity to promises, con-
</p>
<p>tracts, or oaths. It appears that they have acted upon
</p>
<p>these principles for ages and on a scale of vast magnitude.
</p>
<p>Now, it is self-evident that these same principles would
</p>
<p>equally justify them in the use of forgery and fraud in
</p>
<p>order to gain that power which they consider of so much
</p>
<p>moment, and to extend and increase which they resort to
</p>
<p>measures so treacherous and unprincipled.
</p>
<p>Must there not be, therefore, a violent presumption that
</p>
<p>a corporation that has promulgated and sanctioned, as a
</p>
<p>part of its immutable and constitutional law, the princi-
</p>
<p>ple that it is right and a duty to lie for the sake of eccle-
</p>
<p>siastical utility, has already used this principle in laying
</p>
<p>the foundations of its own power and authority ?
</p>
<p>If the principle is deemed right, there will be nothing
</p>
<p>to prevent its use at any time or to any extent that eccle-
</p>
<p>siastical utility shall seem to demand.
</p>
<p>To Protestants, no doubt, it would appear to be a great
</p>
<p>crime to forge documents in the name of eminent men of
</p>
<p>past ages in order to substantiate any claims of any Prot-

</p>
<p>estant body. The training which they receive, and the
</p>
<p>214 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>fundamental principles of their morality, cause them to
</p>
<p>recoil from it with horror.
</p>
<p>But, if the morality of infallible popes and general coun-
</p>
<p>cils is any index of the morals of Romish ecclesiastics,
</p>
<p>they cannot regard it as a crime to forge any documents
</p>
<p>whatever which the welfare of the church seems to demand.
</p>
<p>There is not, therefore, in the fundamental morality of
</p>
<p>that system any thing to render it at all improbable or
</p>
<p>to prevent a high probability that it is entirely based up-
</p>
<p>on a constant use of fraud and forgeries in the past ages
</p>
<p>of history, especially in those in which there was wide-
</p>
<p>spread ignorance and little or no critical skill to detect
</p>
<p>such forgeries.
</p>
<p>Thus the Romish corporation by their own acts have
</p>
<p>entirely cut themselves off from all defence against such
</p>
<p>imputations and presumptions, and laid themselves open
</p>
<p>to the just imputation of a readiness to employ forgery or
</p>
<p>fraud to any extent which their corporate interests might
</p>
<p>seem to demand.
</p>
<p>PEESUMPTION AGAINST ROME FROM PROPHECY.
</p>
<p>If we turn to the word of God we shall be struck with
</p>
<p>the remarkable fact that the rise of a great power is fore-
</p>
<p>told to be distinguished by these two great characteris-
</p>
<p>tics the first, that it should arrogate to itself the place
</p>
<p>of God on earth ; the second, that, in sustaining such ar-
</p>
<p>rogant claims, it should resort to an unparalleled extent
</p>
<p>to the use of every kind of falsehood and fraud. This
</p>
<p>stupendous work of deception was to be commenced soon
</p>
<p>after the ascension of Christ, and was to result in a sys-
</p>
<p>tem of fraud and imposture which, though nominally re-

</p>
<p>exerting immense power, and enduring for ages, until at
</p>
<p>last it should perish before the glorious coming of our
</p>
<p>Savior to inflict just vengeance on his foes. The words
</p>
<p>of inspiration are these, addressed to those who had been
</p>
<p>alarmed by an apprehension of the immediate coming of
</p>
<p>Christ, (2 Thess. ii. 3-12 :)
</p>
<p>" Let no man deceive you by any means ; for that day
</p>
<p>shall not come except there come a falling away first, and
</p>
<p>that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, who
</p>
<p>opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called
</p>
<p>God or that is worshipped ; so that he, as God, sitteth in
</p>
<p>the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. Re-
</p>
<p>member ye not that, when I was yet with you, I told you
</p>
<p>these things ? And now ye know what withholdeth that
</p>
<p>he might be revealed in his time. For the mystery of
</p>
<p>iniquity doth already work ; only he who now letteth
</p>
<p>will let until he be taken out of the way. And then
</p>
<p>shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall con-
</p>
<p>sume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with
</p>
<p>the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is
</p>
<p>after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and
</p>
<p>lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unright-
</p>
<p>eousness in them that perish ; because they received not
</p>
<p>the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for
</p>
<p>this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they
</p>
<p>should believe a lie ; that they all might be damned who
</p>
<p>believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteous-
</p>
<p>ness."
</p>
<p>Now, is it not plain that these words cannot be applied
</p>
<p>to any system except one which makes peculiar pretences
</p>
<p>to take God's place on earth one whose proceedings are

<p>manifestly characterized by a peculiar use of fraud and

</p>
<p>ing of Christ with divine power to execute vengeance
</p>
<p>upon his haughty and usurping adversary ?
</p>
<p>Does not the Romish corporation practically take the
</p>
<p>place of God and exhibit itself as such, especially in ex-
</p>
<p>alting the pope, their head, and giving him the titles and
</p>
<p>worship of God? Is not the use of falsehood, fraud,
</p>
<p>and perfidy their great characteristic? Are not the
</p>
<p>roots of the system in the early ages ? Is it not at this
</p>
<p>time, as in past ages, the great enemy of humanity, whose
</p>
<p>destruction is essential to the coming of an age of intel-
</p>
<p>ligence, liberty, and social purity ? To what other sys-
</p>
<p>tem, then, can the words of the prophecy so reasonably
</p>
<p>be applied as to the corporation of Rome ? Is not this
</p>
<p>the masterpiece of Satan ?
</p>
<p>To this argument the Romish corporation cannot reply
</p>
<p>that they do not believe in the existence of any such being
</p>
<p>as Satan, the great father of lies.
</p>
<p>No body of religionists professes a more full and un-
</p>
<p>doubting faith in the existence and power of the devil
</p>
<p>than the Romish corporation. They boldly proclaim
</p>
<p>that the reformation of Luther is in an eminent degree
</p>
<p>his work. All Bible and tract societies engaged in the
</p>
<p>diffusion of divine truth they ascribe to his crafty and
</p>
<p>malignant devices. But, according to them, the great en-
</p>
<p>emy of the devil on earth is the church of Rome, under
</p>
<p>the pope, her illustrious head.
</p>
<p>Agreeing, then, as we do, that there is a devil, the only
</p>
<p>question is, Whose principles and practice most resemble
</p>
<p>his? And is it not plain that the Romish doctrine of
</p>
<p>falsehood is a genuine and legitimate offspring of him
</p>
<p>who is the father of lies ? Have we not reason, then, to
</p>
<p>think that the Romish corporation also is his work ?

</p>
<p>argument in its defence ; for to the great majority of the
</p>
<p>Christian world it is needless. It is held in common by
</p>
<p>the Romish church, the Greek church, and all the other
</p>
<p>Eastern churches, and by the whole evangelical Protestant
</p>
<p>world, Lutheran, Calvinistic, Episcopal, Methodist, Bap-
</p>
<p>tist, c., although comparatively little theological or phil-
</p>
<p>osophical use has as yet been made of it. As presented in
</p>
<p>the word of God, no doctrine is more fundamental. The
</p>
<p>great end of the incarnation was to destroy the devil and
</p>
<p>his kingdom by the redemption of the church. (1 John iii.
</p>
<p>2. Heb. ii. 14, 15.) Christ will reign as Mediator till it
</p>
<p>is done ; and then cometh the end. (1 Cor. xv. 24, 25.)
</p>
<p>Owing to the depravity of man, he has, where God
</p>
<p>does not prevent, entire ascendency over the race : he
</p>
<p>forms tremendous organizations, and by them deceives
</p>
<p>the nations and governs the world. (2 Cor. iv. 3, 4.
</p>
<p>Eph. ii. 1, 2. Rev. xiii. 1-4.)
</p>
<p>The millennial reign of Christ is caused, not by the un-
</p>
<p>aided progress of the human mind, but by the exposure
</p>
<p>and destruction of Satan's organizations, and to his being
</p>
<p>bound and cast into the abyss, so as not to be an active
</p>
<p>agent in the history of the world or able to deceive the
</p>
<p>nations. (Rev. xix. 20, 21 ; xx. 1-8.) If these things
</p>
<p>are so, it must be conceded that every system of theology,
</p>
<p>history, or philosophy is fatally defective that omits him.
</p>
<p>It is not God's theology, history, or philosophy, but
</p>
<p>Satan's, designed to hide himself ; and any system of
</p>
<p>theology or philosophy is superficial that takes a super-
</p>
<p>ficial view of him. To take a profound and philosophical
</p>
<p>view of the Roman hierarchy, without a thorough analysis
</p>
<p>of his character, and maxims, and modes of deceit, is im-
</p>
<p>possible. And, before this great controversy comes to its
</p>
<p>crisis, he, and not any individual or generation, will be the
</p>
<p>great subject of attack.

</p>
<p>218 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>Assuming the truth of these views, I shall proceed to
</p>
<p>present additional presumptive evidence that the Romish
</p>
<p>corporation is the system of satanic fraud and delusion
</p>
<p>which is predicted in the word of God.
</p>
<p>It is plain, then, that the great system of fraud pre-
</p>
<p>dicted, whatever it is, had its roots in ages immediately
</p>
<p>after Christ, was for a time restrained, but was at last
</p>
<p>developed and completed by an astounding use of impos-
</p>
<p>ture and delusion, and exists even to this day. Does this
</p>
<p>general view best accord with the Roman corporation or
</p>
<p>with Protestantism ? I affirm that it best accords with
</p>
<p>Romanism. I shall, therefore, proceed to present the
</p>
<p>presumptive evidence that the Romish hierarchy is this
</p>
<p>stupendous system of fraud.
</p>
<p>Before proceeding to the proof, it is suitable to state
</p>
<p>explicitly what part is to be assigned to man in this stu-
</p>
<p>pendous fraud, and also to consider the nature and power
</p>
<p>of the additional presumptive evidence which is to be
</p>
<p>adduced.
</p>
<p>What part, then, is to be assigned to man ?
</p>
<p>1. Not that any one human mind ever in any age delib-
</p>
<p>erately and consciously planned and organized the whole
</p>
<p>system from the beginning, knowing it to be a fraud, as
</p>
<p>was no doubt true in the case of Joseph Smith when he
</p>
<p>formed a plan to delude his followers by the book of
</p>
<p>Mormon.
</p>
<p>2. Nor that any number of men cooperating in one
</p>
<p>age, or in different ages, ever planned it as a whole,
</p>
<p>knowing it to be a fraud.
</p>
<p>3. Nor that the great mass of the laity whom it has
</p>
<p>deluded and controlled have ever supposed it to be a
</p>
<p>fraud.
</p>
<p>4. Nor that all of its leading administrators and ad-

</p>
<p>vocates have ever regarded it as a fraud, though very
</p>
<p>PRESUMPTIVE EVIDENCE OF THE FACT. 219
</p>
<p>many have so regarded and used it when planned to their
</p>
<p>hands even popes, bishops, and priests.
</p>
<p>5. Nor that there is no important doctrinal truth in
</p>
<p>some of its dogmas : there is much.
</p>
<p>6. Nor that no good men have ignorantly contributed
</p>
<p>to its formation, and lived under it, and obeyed it, as
</p>
<p>victims of delusion.
</p>
<p>7. Nor that it has never done any good ; but that the
</p>
<p>truth and the peculiarities of the system do not proper-
</p>
<p>ly belong together ; that one is of God, the other of the
</p>
<p>devil ; and that good men under it are made by the truth
</p>
<p>in spite of the system, and not because of it ; and that
</p>
<p>the good done is and has been done by the same truth and
</p>
<p>by good men in spite of the system, and not because of it.
</p>
<p>But the system, as a system, is false and pernicious, and,
</p>
<p>though not framed at once as a whole by any man or
</p>
<p>body of men as a fraud, was framed by that one far-seeing,
</p>
<p>comprehensive mind of whom the apostle speaks once in
</p>
<p>heaven, and familiar with the whole character, laws, and
</p>
<p>administration of God, deeply versed in all questions of
</p>
<p>theology, skilled in organization and government, perfectly
</p>
<p>acquainted with all the phases of the human mind and of
</p>
<p>society, and a master of alj. the arts of sophistry and de-
</p>
<p>lusion to a degree beyond the conception of a human mind,
</p>
<p>and before whom all men and nations, not illuminated and
</p>
<p>defended by God, are, by reason of their dislike of the
</p>
<p>truth, mere simpletons objects of his craft and delusive
</p>
<p>power entangled in his snares, led captive at his will.
</p>
<p>He, living whilst generations die, is able to lay a plan
</p>
<p>requiring centuries for its execution. He can take ad-
</p>
<p>vantage of human depravity in all its forms and of the
</p>
<p>deep dislike of men to humbling and self-denying truth ;
</p>
<p>also of existing errors of philosophy or education, know-

</p>
<p>results. Also he can avail himself of the remaining
</p>
<p>depravity, worldliness, and pride of good men, and of
</p>
<p>the various errors which they mingle with truth. Also
</p>
<p>he can avail himself of existing defective forms of civil
</p>
<p>organization, and of the spirit, associations, tastes, and
</p>
<p>habits produced by them, in order by means of them to
</p>
<p>vitiate the spirit and form of Christian organization.
</p>
<p>Availing himself of all these, he has by a delusive pro-
</p>
<p>cess, holding up great and good ends, such as preserving
</p>
<p>doctrine and unity in the church, produced a system
</p>
<p>adapted on the whole to do as much evil and as little
</p>
<p>good as in existing circumstances was possible ; for being
</p>
<p>limited to the problem of working by delusion, under the
</p>
<p>guise of Christianity, he could not work at all without
</p>
<p>doing some good and without some good men to work
</p>
<p>with. All that he could do would be to profess enough
</p>
<p>good to put men off their guard, and actually to do a cer-
</p>
<p>tain amount of good, or at least allow it to be done by those
</p>
<p>who had a heart to do it. But he would make the pre-
</p>
<p>ponderating influence evil to the highest degree he could.
</p>
<p>Now, when I call the system of the Romish hierarchy a
</p>
<p>stupendous fraud, I mean that it is a system, devised by
</p>
<p>Satan for this very end, and that by it he has thus far
</p>
<p>gained it to an astonishing extent. The delusion has
</p>
<p>been strong and complete to an amazing degree. It has
</p>
<p>been strong delusion to believe a lie. The system has
</p>
<p>wielded vast power and endured for century after centu-
</p>
<p>ry. By it Satan has still retained his position as the god
</p>
<p>of this world, and, what is still more amazing, has placed
</p>
<p>his throne in the temple of God, and thence sent forth
</p>
<p>his decrees to the nations and done his will without let
</p>
<p>or hinderance. I therefore can even suppose that Mr.
</p>
<p>Brownson and other lay Romanists are free from any at-

</p>
<p>tempt to sustain a known and designed fraud. I can
</p>
<p>PRESUMPTIVE EVIDENCE OF THE FACT. 221
</p>
<p>regard them simply as the sincere but deluded subjects of
</p>
<p>a higher fraud, and would desire in meekness to instruct
</p>
<p>them, if peradventure God may give them repentance, to
</p>
<p>the acknowledging of the truth, and that they may deliver
</p>
<p>themselves from the snares of Satan who are led captive
</p>
<p>by him at his will. Nor let any one suppose that I mean
</p>
<p>any disrespect by this. The existence of a devil has
</p>
<p>always been a fundamental doctrine of the Romish system ;
</p>
<p>nor do they hesitate to declare that Protestantism is his
</p>
<p>work. Hence Mr. Brownson represents the devil as
</p>
<p>greatly enraged by the present onset of the Roman world
</p>
<p>upon it and speaking great swelling words in its defence.
</p>
<p>Now, as both systems agree most fully in teaching the
</p>
<p>existence of a devil, and as they are logical opposites,
</p>
<p>of one or the other the devil is the author, and the advo-
</p>
<p>cates of one or the other are deluded. The Romanists
</p>
<p>charge it on the Protestants, and the Protestants retort
</p>
<p>the charge ; and thus they come to a logical issue. Just
</p>
<p>so was it between the Jews and Christ. They charged
</p>
<p>on him a league with the devil. He retorted on them the
</p>
<p>charge that they were of their father the devil ; and so
</p>
<p>they came to an issue.
</p>
<p>I proceed to show that the logical presumption is that
</p>
<p>the Romish hierarchy is a stupendous fraud of the devil.
</p>
<p>What, then, is the nature and power of the presumptive
</p>
<p>evidence which I propose to adduce? It is that which
</p>
<p>arises from the action of the mind when it takes a rapid
</p>
<p>and comprehensive view of the leading facts of a given
</p>
<p>case and asks what hypothesis best explains them.
</p>
<p>Here a general knowledge of God and of the laws and
</p>
<p>principles of his system is supposed ; also of men and
</p>
<p>human society ; also of the devil, and his character, laws,
</p>
<p>and modes of proceeding. And the question is raised,
</p>
<p>Which looks most likely that this system is of God as it

<p>222 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>claims, or that it is a stupendous fraud of the devil ? This
</p>
<p>is an effort of the mind to guard itself against limited,
</p>
<p>onesided views, or against the delusive power of dialectic
</p>
<p>sophistry, which it may not see how at once to analyze
</p>
<p>and destroy. It is like ascending a mountain and taking
</p>
<p>at a glance a general view of the prospect around. It
</p>
<p>deserves great regard ; and it enables sound and compre-
</p>
<p>hensive minds at once to see the general current or drift
</p>
<p>of evidence on a given point.
</p>
<p>Taking, then, in the first place a general view, I assert
</p>
<p>that, when we consider the extraordinary and all-compre-
</p>
<p>hending claims of this corporation, the prodigious powers
</p>
<p>of despotism they would grasp in their hands, the manner in
</p>
<p>which such claims ought to be proved, the kind and degree
</p>
<p>of proof offered, and the general mode in which they have
</p>
<p>in all ages conducted the argument, the whole procedure
</p>
<p>has on its face the appearance of a stupendous fraud.
</p>
<p>The points asserted and to be proved are, 1. That
</p>
<p>Christ intended to have a permanent corporation of
</p>
<p>bishops under one universal bishop, his representative
</p>
<p>and vicar, as successors of the apostles, who should
</p>
<p>have, as a corporation, inspiration, infallibility, and inde-
</p>
<p>fectibility. 2. That such a body is a church in any proper
</p>
<p>sense, and not a mere ecclesiastical hierarchy. 3. That
</p>
<p>Peter was the first head of this body. 4. Not only that
</p>
<p>Peter was at Rome, but that he had his see there, as uni-
</p>
<p>versal bishop of the church on earth. 5. That his su-
</p>
<p>premacy was to descend to his successors. 6. That God
</p>
<p>speaks and acts exclusively through this corporation ; so
</p>
<p>that all who reject them reject God, and cannot believe or
</p>
<p>be saved. Such are the claims put forth with the highest
</p>
<p>assurance in the centre of New England and before the
</p>
<p>civilized world and God most high.

</p>
<p>Now, in cases far less momentous there are principles
</p>
<p>PRESUMPTIVE EVIDENCE OP THE FACT. 223
</p>
<p>of proof by which the common sense of mankind is wont
</p>
<p>to test any claims affecting life, reputation, or estate ; and
</p>
<p>there are intrinsic marks of honesty in presenting and
</p>
<p>sustaining such claims ; so that the mind, without going
</p>
<p>into logical details, receives, by an instantaneous judg-
</p>
<p>ment, a conviction of the truth or falsehood of the claims.
</p>
<p>I shall show that it is utterly impossible fairly to state
</p>
<p>these claims, and then put side by side the proof on which
</p>
<p>they are based, without comment, and then consider the
</p>
<p>mode in which the argument has always been conducted,
</p>
<p>without producing an instantaneous conviction that the
</p>
<p>whole system is a stupendous fraud practised on the
</p>
<p>credulity of the human race.
</p>
<p>I am aware that the Romanists repudiate this view as
</p>
<p>absurd and incredible ; but there are no pledges of God
</p>
<p>against the occurrence in the nominal church of such a
</p>
<p>corruption as this would imply, beginning early, extending
</p>
<p>wide, and changing the most powerful acting church to a
</p>
<p>harlot. Against this the Romanists cry out, as a breach
</p>
<p>of God's covenant to the church, as the Jews did when
</p>
<p>Paul announced their rejection and ruin. " If this is so,
</p>
<p>then the gates of hell have prevailed against the church,"
</p>
<p>say they. The whole force of this goes upon the assump-
</p>
<p>tion that the gates of hell here spoken of are not the
</p>
<p>gates of Rome, and that the oath of God does not bind
</p>
<p>him to destroy her in order to defend his church against
</p>
<p>the gates of hell. And truly nothing is adapted more
</p>
<p>clearly to show the power of God than to defend and
</p>
<p>preserve in this world a spiritual church, notwithstanding
</p>
<p>the debaucheries, rage, and bloody persecutions of Rome.
</p>
<p>All this looks vastly like defending the church against the
</p>
<p>gates of hell and the armies of hell issuing from those
</p>
<p>gates.

</p>
<p>But, not to rely on a mere negative statement, we do
</p>
<p>224 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>know from the passage quoted that a stupendous fraud
</p>
<p>was to take place under the presiding influence of Satan,
</p>
<p>involving so much power, and leading to an opposition to
</p>
<p>God so great, that its destruction should call for a special
</p>
<p>interposition of Christ by the spirit of his mouth and the
</p>
<p>brightness of his appearing. Indeed the letters of Christ
</p>
<p>to the seven churches, the letters of Paul, and the Apoc-
</p>
<p>alypse of John all speak one language on this subject.
</p>
<p>They all portend a widespread and fatal apostasy in the
</p>
<p>visible church ; that the real church should as it were lie
</p>
<p>hid, and yet be miraculously defended by God against the
</p>
<p>rage of Satan in the ruling church.
</p>
<p>"We are also distinctly informed in the text that the
</p>
<p>elements out of which it was to be formed were then in
</p>
<p>existence and at work, repressed indeed by certain causes,
</p>
<p>but sure to develop themselves when those causes should
</p>
<p>be removed. Again : we know that the full development

<p>of the pure and holy church of God, the marriage supper
</p>
<p>of the Lamb, the conversion of the world, the binding of
</p>
<p>Satan, and the reign of Christ were unfolded as events in
</p>
<p>the far-distant future, to be preceded by a period of great
</p>
<p>iniquity, in which the bottomless pit should be opened
</p>
<p>and stupendous satanic systems be developed, the destruc-
</p>
<p>tion of which should precede and introduce those glorious
</p>
<p>events.
</p>
<p>No points are more distinctly marked in the word of
</p>
<p>God than these. (See Rev. xix. 20.) They are like lofty
</p>
<p>mountain peaks ; nothing can hide or obscure them. They
</p>
<p>are in pointed contradiction of the Romish hypothesis,
</p>
<p>that the first thing after Christ was the full development
</p>
<p>of the true church ; they fall in entirely with the Protes-
</p>
<p>tant view, that the first great and organized system to be
</p>
<p>developed was a stupendous fraud, imposed on the world

<p>by Satan in the guise of a church of God.
</p>
<p>PRESUMPTIVE EVIDENCE OF THE FACT. 225
</p>
<p>A second presumptive argument lies in the nature of the
</p>
<p>system as it is now presented to us in its perfected state.
</p>
<p>What is this system? Suppose all opposition to cease,
</p>
<p>and let it have its way ; what would it become? A close
</p>
<p>corporation, invested with the monopoly of the grace of
</p>
<p>God, and of heaven and hell, to the whole human race,
</p>
<p>centralized by a universal spiritual monarch, denying in
</p>
<p>the name of God any responsibility to any human power
</p>
<p>on earth.
</p>
<p>Think now what man is that the experience of all
</p>
<p>ages has taught us that the possession of irresponsible
</p>
<p>power above all things corrupts its possessors ; think that
</p>
<p>even Paul needed the counterpoise of constant afflictions
</p>
<p>to keep him from pride ; and then ask, Are we to expect
</p>
<p>that Romish popes and bishops, as a general fact, will be
</p>
<p>such paragons of piety and humility that all this honor
</p>
<p>and power will not corrupt and injure them ? I do not
</p>
<p>ask what the facts have been ; that I shall consider when I
</p>
<p>proceed to demonstrate that the system is of the devil. I
</p>
<p>am looking merely at the general aspect of the system
</p>
<p>now. God, we know, above all things abhors pride. Does
</p>
<p>this system, now, look like an exquisite divine device to pro-
</p>
<p>mote humility? Look at its bishops, archbishops, patri-
</p>
<p>archs, metropolitans, cardinals, and at the summit of the
</p>
<p>great pyramid, the absolute monarch of eight hundred mil-
</p>
<p>lions of men, for such he claims to be by divine right,
</p>
<p>and does it strike you as God's school of humility,? Think
</p>
<p>what Christ said when the disciples disputed who should
</p>
<p>be greatest ; how he mentioned the bad precedents of the
</p>
<p>aspiring great men of this world only to condemn them
</p>
<p>and to say, Among you it shall not be so ; and is it prob-
</p>
<p>able that nevertheless he meant to found a spiritual aris-
</p>
<p>tocracy, centralized by an absolute monarch, in comparison
</p>
<p>with which all the ambitious dreams of Alexander, Caesar,

</p>
<p>and Bonaparte are eclipsed and disappear ?
</p>
<p>226 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>. Again : think of him whose essence is pride who said,
</p>
<p>" I will mount up ; I will be as God ; " is it likely that we
</p>
<p>are to find his great antagonist in such a system as this?
</p>
<p>Does it not rather seem to bear his very image and super-
</p>
<p>scription ? Does it seem as if Satan, if he had desired a sys-
</p>
<p>tem to call into his service the strongest depraved passions
</p>
<p>of the human heart, pride, and the love of wealth, honor,
</p>
<p>power, and sensual indulgence, could have devised a better
</p>
<p>plan ? And is this, after all, the only church of the living
</p>
<p>God, out of which there can be no holiness and no salva-
</p>
<p>tion ? Is it not more likely that this is the man of sin
</p>
<p>spoken of in the text, whom the Lord will consume by the
</p>
<p>breath of his. mouth and destroy by the brightness of his
</p>
<p>coming?
</p>
<p>I am aware that a cover of piety may be thrown over all
</p>
<p>this and much said of unity and orthodoxy ; and we may
</p>
<p>be told that we must trust in God to take care that his bride,
</p>
<p>his wife, does not abuse her power. We will trust in God
</p>
<p>indeed. But prove to us, first, that this corporation is his
</p>
<p>bride, his wife ; for, to speak the simple truth, she looks
</p>
<p>far more like the harlot of Satan, attired in scarlet, than
</p>
<p>like the bride, the Lamb's wife, attired in fine linen, clean
</p>
<p>and white.
</p>
<p>Another presumptive argument that the system is a stu-
</p>
<p>pendous fraud is found in the extreme scantiness of the
</p>
<p>scriptural proof by which it is sustained.
</p>
<p>There is no specific, formal, and definite statement of the
</p>
<p>system in the Bible such as a system of power like this
</p>
<p>ought to have. Compare the statement of powers of
</p>
<p>officers in the laws of Moses, and the constitution of the
</p>
<p>United States, and in the case of Christ, with the state-
</p>
<p>ments claimed for this corporation as its scriptural proofs.
</p>
<p>Now, this corporation is, according to Romanists, more im-

</p>
<p>atonement or the Bible. They are absolutely of no use
</p>
<p>without it. The system of God cannot go, it utterly fails,
</p>
<p>without it. If so, do not reason and common sense say
</p>
<p>it ought to be fully stated in the Bible ? If a mechanic,
</p>
<p>designing to teach a nation how to make and use steam-
</p>
<p>boats, should describe all other parts of the system, but
</p>
<p>should omit all mention of steam, and of the boiler and its
</p>
<p>attendant machinery, what should we think of it ? But if
</p>
<p>this corporation, with their head, is the mainspring of the
</p>
<p>system, why is it not fully described? When the disciples
</p>
<p>were contending who should be greatest, it would have
</p>
<p>been easy to say, Peter shall be universal bishop, and to
</p>
<p>arrange the whole matter. When Peter was writing his
</p>
<p>epistles, it would have been easy for him, if he was at
</p>
<p>Rome, to say so, and, if he was head of the church, to
</p>
<p>write in that style. It would have been easy for Paul,
</p>
<p>when writing to Rome, to recognize the fact that Peter
</p>
<p>was the bishop of that church, that his see was there,
</p>
<p>and that his dominion and that of his successors was co-
</p>
<p>extensive with the globe. And as the successors of the
</p>
<p>apostles were to have only corporate inspiration and
</p>
<p>infallibility, it would have been easy to state it and
</p>
<p>how it was to be exercised a thing not even yet
</p>
<p>decided.
</p>
<p>Now, how easy would it have been to have started right
</p>
<p>at the beginning if the claims of this corporation are true !
</p>
<p>But, alas 1 what an utter void is there where indisputable
</p>
<p>proof ought to be found ! True, certain things are said to
</p>
<p>the apostles, and it is implied that they were to have
</p>
<p>successors of some sort, and that with them Christ would
</p>
<p>be to the end of the world ; but not a step can be taken
</p>
<p>without begging the question who these successors should
</p>
<p>be. True, also, certain things are said to Peter ; but

<p>here, too, not a step can be taken without begging the

</p>
<p>question and assuming their own interpretation as the
</p>
<p>only correct one. But as to Rome, and a see there, &c.,
</p>
<p>there is an utter blank.
</p>
<p>Indeed the celebrated Newman, the leader of the Trac-
</p>
<p>tarians, now, like Mr. Brownson, in the bosom of Rome, in
</p>
<p>his work on ecclesiastical development, designed to say
</p>
<p>all in behalf of Rome that he can, is obliged to admit the
</p>
<p>truth of all I say. He confesses that the passages of
</p>
<p>Scripture claimed by the Papal see are " more or less ob-
</p>
<p>Bcurc, and NEEDS A COMMENT." He admits that the Pa-
</p>
<p>pacy was not developed or known during the first two cen-
</p>
<p>turies, nor were ecumenical councils. He assigns, too, the
</p>
<p>reason why the persecuting pagan Roman empire rendered
</p>
<p>the development of such a system impossible. He resorts
</p>
<p>to the idea of an intended divine development of it when
</p>
<p>it appeared. There was a development, no doubt ; but
</p>
<p>whether of God or of the devil is the question. To me
</p>
<p>Newman's words look like an undesigned comment on
</p>
<p>Paul's statement, in the passage quoted, of the temporary
</p>
<p>repression of the mystery of iniquity, and its development
</p>
<p>when the obstacle should be removed.
</p>
<p>Hear him : " An international bond " [like the Papacy]
</p>
<p>" and a common authority could not be consolidated, were
</p>
<p>it ever so certainly provided, while persecutions lasted.
</p>
<p>If the imperial power checked the development of coun-
</p>
<p>cils, it availed also for keeping back the power of the
</p>
<p>Papacy." But when persecution was removed, it was, ac-
</p>
<p>cording to him, developed, and, when the imperial power
</p>
<p>fell, still more so. Amen. So I understand Paul to assert
</p>
<p>of the man of sin in the text. At all events, Mr. New-
</p>
<p>man is compelled to concede my facts. He admits that
</p>
<p>for two centuries " the regalia Petri * slept," as " a mys-

<p>terious privilege not understood as an unfulfilled proph-
</p>
<p>ecy."
</p>
<p>And is it likely that this is the way God would have
</p>
<p>established a power on the reception of which heaven and
</p>
<p>hell depend, without which the Bible cannot be under-
</p>
<p>stood by a few obscure passages, so obscure that for two
</p>
<p>centuries no one understood them, and the powers giv-
</p>
<p>en slumbered like the meaning of an unfulfilled proph-
</p>
<p>ecy ? And yet nothing more does even Mr. Newman dare
</p>
<p>to claim.
</p>
<p>No wonder that the Eomanists think that the Bible
</p>
<p>needs the church for an interpreter ; for no other body in
</p>
<p>heaven or on earth could get any support for their hier-
</p>
<p>archy out of it. Plainly at first sight it is not there ;
</p>
<p>and you may strain your eyes, and yet you cannot see it.
</p>
<p>If all this is not strong presumptive evidence of a stupen-
</p>
<p>dous fraud, I know not what is.
</p>
<p>Another presumptive evidence of a stupendous fraud is
</p>
<p>the manner in which the argument has been conducted
</p>
<p>from age to age.
</p>
<p>The claims of the hierarchy are not the same from age
</p>
<p>to age ; they are now stupendous and all-comprehending.
</p>
<p>Go back beyond Gregory VII. , and how are they dimin-
</p>
<p>ished ! Go back to the days of Augustine, and how are
</p>
<p>they still diminished ! Go back to the first century, and
</p>
<p>they disappear. The system is like a pyramid standing
</p>
<p>on its apex and with its base upward ; and Mr. Newman
</p>
<p>is trying to prop it up by developments and Mr. Brown-
</p>
<p>son by a priori arguments. But what does it most resem-
</p>
<p>ble the honesty of God, or the fraud of a deceiving spirit,
</p>
<p>augmenting his claims as best he can by any means, fair
</p>
<p>or foul, from age to age?

<p>force, and not on argument, betokens that she is the tern-

</p>
<p>pie of the father of lies, and not of God. When they
</p>
<p>are in the minority her advocates disclaim the use of
</p>
<p>force. But does the infallible hierarchy ? Let the coun-
</p>
<p>cils of the Lateran ; let the dungeons, and racks, and stakes
</p>
<p>of the Inquisition ; let the crusades against the Albigenses
</p>
<p>and the massacre of St. Bartholomew ; let the oceans of
</p>
<p>blood shed by her authority and order, reply. And does
</p>
<p>this create a presumption that the presiding spirit of that
</p>
<p>church is mild, and meek, and gentle, sustained by an
</p>
<p>inward consciousness that God and all the truth in the
</p>
<p>universe are on her side? Or is it like the conduct of a
</p>
<p>ruling spirit who knows that the whole fabric is based on
</p>
<p>lies, and that, so soon as true logic and true holiness shall
</p>
<p>have free course and divine energy, he and his system will
</p>
<p>be plunged together into a lake of logical and unquench-
</p>
<p>able fire ?
</p>
<p>Again : the same presumption that the whole system is
</p>
<p>one of fraud is created by the unfeigned horror with
</p>
<p>which it has regarded the translation and circulation of
</p>
<p>the Bible in the living languages of men. Is not this a
</p>
<p>clear presumption of fraud? Is the President of these
</p>
<p>United States afraid of the constitution of these United
</p>
<p>States? Does he deem it a dangerous document? Does
</p>
<p>he wish to lock it up in Latin and keep it out of the hands
</p>
<p>of the people? Why then the constant roaring of the
</p>
<p>pope against Bible societies ? Is not the Bible the con-
</p>
<p>stitution of the kingdom of Christ? And, if he meant to
</p>
<p>have a pope in his church, is not his office clearly set forth
</p>
<p>in the constitution of his church ? Alas ! Mr. Newman
</p>
<p>tells us the passages claimed by the pope are " more or
</p>
<p>less obscure, and need a comment." Even so they do need
</p>
<p>a comment, and one that is able to subvert the obvious
</p>
<p>sense of the whole Bible. Hence the indispensable ne-

<p>can, and at least of obliging all men, on pain of eternal
</p>
<p>damnation, implicitly to believe their interpretation of it.
</p>
<p>Five bulls against Bible societies have been issued in the
</p>
<p>last thirty years the last in 1844. It chills the blood to
</p>
<p>hear in what manner they speak of the Bible and of the
</p>
<p>" crafty device " of circulating the revealed word of God.
</p>
<p>The devil, it would seem, in his rage against Rome, has
</p>
<p>become the great patron of Bible societies. It is hard to
</p>
<p>tell whether this is most blasphemous or ludicrous. And
</p>
<p>what is the flimsy pretext of all this ? Do they talk of
</p>
<p>inaccurate versions ? Surely they were admirable judges
</p>
<p>who in the council of Trent declared the Vulgate the ul-
</p>
<p>timate standard of appeal, with all its notorious errors.
</p>
<p>And why? Because the infallible bishops of that council,
</p>
<p>according to Sarpi, did not know enough of Hebrew and
</p>
<p>Greek to read it in the original, and in Latin they could
</p>
<p>read it. And so Mr. Brownson now appeals to the Latin
</p>
<p>original instead of the Hebrew or Greek ! Is this the
</p>
<p>church to be so fierce against inaccurate translations?
</p>
<p>But the pretext is too flimsy. Beneath those ecclesiastical
</p>
<p>robes and forms of piety in the midst of that church there
</p>
<p>meets the eye a presiding spirit whose whole soul is filled
</p>
<p>with dread and hatred of the word of God. To him
</p>
<p>it is a consuming fire ; and hence in rage he would burn
</p>
<p>it with fire. When the time comes I shall exhibit at large
</p>
<p>the treatment it has received from the hierarchy. At this
</p>
<p>time I present only that impression which a general view
</p>
<p>of facts at once forces on an honest mind. Nothing is a
</p>
<p>stronger presumptive argument against this church than
</p>
<p>this constant dread of the word of God, and earnest de-
</p>
<p>sire- to introduce apocryphal books and human traditions
</p>
<p>as the basis of her arguments in order to sustain a sink-
</p>
<p>ing cause. But no human tongue can tell one half of the

</p>
<p>by Him who, by the spirit of his mouth and the brightness
</p>
<p>of his coming, shall, like devouring fire, forever consume
</p>
<p>this stupendous system of organized fraud.
</p>
<p>If any one desires to reply to this, let him, if he dares,
</p>
<p>first give a complete and discriminating analysis of the
</p>
<p>character, maxims, and spirit of God and of Satan in con-
</p>
<p>trast and according to the word of God. Who will de-
</p>
<p>ny that there is a broad, an infinite, distinction between
</p>
<p>their characters, maxims, and spirit, as laid down in the
</p>
<p>word of God ? What is it? Let the Romanists, then, do
</p>
<p>what they never yet have done let them state the exact
</p>
<p>difference between God and the devil, not in general
</p>
<p>terms, but in a practical point of view and according to
</p>
<p>his word, and then prove, if they can, that the facts in
</p>
<p>the history of their church to which I have referred create
</p>
<p>a logical presumption that God is its author, and not the
</p>
<p>devil. But this they can never do. Nay, that is saying
</p>
<p>but little. When such a contrast of the character of God
</p>
<p>and the devil shall be made, it will become, according to
</p>
<p>the law of cause and effect, as logically certain as the law
</p>
<p>of gravitation that no being but the devil can be the au-
</p>
<p>thor and presiding spirit of that church. But the full
</p>
<p>proof on this point Lreserve to a future argument. It is
</p>
<p>enough that I have clearly stated at present the presump-
</p>
<p>tive proof that the whole system is a stupendous fraud of
</p>
<p>Satan.
</p>
<p>When God comes to destroy that system he will admit
</p>
<p>of no neutrality. If it is not what it professes to be, there
</p>
<p>is no blasphemy like it, nor will God display towards any
</p>
<p>other system such fierceness of wrath. Let every man,
</p>
<p>then, take care on which side he is found in this final .war.

<p>CHAPTER II.
</p>
<p>ARGUMENT FROM HISTORY.
</p>
<p>IT is certainly very unusual to be called on to make
</p>
<p>the charge of a regular and extensive system of forgery
</p>
<p>and fraud upon a powerful corporation professing to be
</p>
<p>religious, and even to assert that the very existence of
</p>
<p>that corporation is owing to such forgery and fraud.
</p>
<p>In ordinary. cases I would not do it; but this is no
</p>
<p>ordinary case. In common cases any corporation profess-
</p>
<p>ing to be respectable has a right to the presumption that
</p>
<p>it will not practise forgery and gross deception. The
</p>
<p>reason is that they all avow the principle that these
</p>
<p>things are always wrong.
</p>
<p>But with the Romish corporation it is not so. They
</p>
<p>avow the doctrine that to lie and deceive for ecclesiastical
</p>
<p>utility is right. This being the case, it is obviously im-
</p>
<p>possible to create a presumption that the system was not
</p>
<p>formed by the use of forgery and fraud. On the other
</p>
<p>hand, there must be a very strong presumption that it was.
</p>
<p>I do not hesitate, therefore, to say that facts accord
</p>
<p>with this presumption, and that there is the most unequiv-
</p>
<p>ocal historical evidence that such was the origin of the
</p>
<p>system. Nor is the evidence of this assertion sparing or

<p>feeble. It can be demonstrated, by even a superfluity of

<p>unequivocal and undeniable historical evidence, that the

<p>principle of lying for ecclesiastical utility is the absolute

<p>ARGUMENT FROM HISTORY-. 235
</p>
<p>creator of every .part and particle of the Romish corpora-
</p>
<p>tion as it now exists.
</p>
<p>Not a feature of its present constitution can be men-
</p>
<p>tioned that cannot be traced back by the clearest histor-
</p>
<p>ical evidence to a time when it did not exist, and the pro-
</p>
<p>cess can be shown through which it was created by fraud
</p>
<p>and *brgery. There is, in fact, nothing to be compared
</p>
<p>with this system of forgery for its magnitude and results
</p>
<p>in the history of the world. But at this we need not won-
</p>
<p>der. If the principle of lying for ecclesiastical utility is
</p>
<p>sound, why should it not be carried out on a great scale ?
</p>
<p>But to descend to particulars. The pope is now a tem-
</p>
<p>poral ruler of a territory about three times as large as the
</p>
<p>State of Massachusetts. It stretches across Italy from the
</p>
<p>Mediterranean to the Adriatic. It is an essential part of
</p>
<p>.the present system. It makes him independent of any
</p>
<p>temporal ruler. He is bound by no oath of allegiance to
</p>
<p>any earthly sovereign. This is felt to be essential in
</p>
<p>order to carry out his claims as a universal spiritual sov-
</p>
<p>ereign. Was it always thus? I answer. No. He was
</p>
<p>not always ruler of this or of any other territory. We can
</p>
<p>trace back the history of this matter to the beginning ;
</p>
<p>and we find that the original claim was founded on a
</p>
<p>most notorious forgery, purporting to be a donation of
</p>
<p>territory from the Emperor Constantine.
</p>
<p>This was followed up by other similar forgeries, until
</p>
<p>at last an actual beginning of temporal power, first de-
</p>
<p>pendent, and finally independent, was made. After this it
</p>
<p>was extended by war and treachery to its present extent.
</p>
<p>The pope is now elected by a college of cardinals, who
</p>
<p>are princes in the Papal state and next in honor to the
</p>
<p>pope. From them alone can he be chosen. Was it al-

</p>
<p>ways thus? I answer, No. We can trace back this part
</p>
<p>236 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>of the system until it entirely disappears, and can point
</p>
<p>out its fraudulent and unauthorized origin.
</p>
<p>The bishops of the Romish church are now bound to
</p>
<p>the pope by a feudal oath, which plainly betrays itself as a
</p>
<p>product of the middle ages. "We can trace this, too, back
</p>
<p>till it disappears, and we come to a time when every
</p>
<p>bishop in Europe, Asia, and Africa would have denounced
</p>
<p>with indignation the demand of any such oath as an act
</p>
<p>of impious and unparalleled usurpation of authority.
</p>
<p>The pope has now supreme judicial authority. No
</p>
<p>bishop, no synod, has ultimate jurisdiction. An appeal
</p>
<p>may be taken from them all to Rome. We can trace this
</p>
<p>part also of the system back to the time when the supreme
</p>
<p>judicial authority of the pope wholly disappears, and each
</p>
<p>local church with its rulers was entirely independent of
</p>
<p>every other. The idea of an appeal from the decision of
</p>
<p>particular churches to synods was at length introduced ;
</p>
<p>but even after this the idea of a universal appeal to
</p>
<p>the Bishop of Rome was repudiated with the utmost de-
</p>
<p>cision. Indeed by the first general council, A. D. 325, it
</p>
<p>was absolutely and definitely forbidden. The existing
</p>
<p>judicial power of the pope was obtained by forgery.
</p>
<p>At the present time, too, the pope has the power of
</p>
<p>making laws and prescribing usages for the whole church.
</p>
<p>He also is invested with supreme executive power. "We
</p>
<p>can trace these parts of the system also back till they
</p>
<p>disappear. We can discover, too, the very forgeries
</p>
<p>by which the present state of things was brought into
</p>
<p>existence.
</p>
<p>The pope, moreover, now claims supremacy on the ground
</p>
<p>of the assumed fact that Peter was appointed the prince
</p>
<p>of the apostles and the head and ruler of the church.

</p>
<p>We can trace this claim also back to a time in which
</p>
<p>ARGUMENT FROM HISTORY. 237
</p>
<p>those who are now absurdly called the early Popes of
</p>
<p>Rome were utterly ignorant of this doctrine and made no
</p>
<p>such claim ; and we can show how after four or five
</p>
<p>centuries the idea was introduced and how it was made
</p>
<p>to triumph by falsehood and fraud.
</p>
<p>The doctrine also as to the infallible authority of a
</p>
<p>general council under the pope can be traced back till it
</p>
<p>utterly disappears, together with the very idea of such a
</p>
<p>council.
</p>
<p>Moreover, when the idea of calling such a council was
</p>
<p>originated, the Bishop of Rome neither called it, presided
</p>
<p>in it, nor confirmed and gave authority to its decrees. His
</p>
<p>right to do all these things has been since usurped by
</p>
<p>falsehood and fraud.
</p>
<p>The law of the celibacy of the clergy, which is one main
</p>
<p>pillar of the Papacy, can also be thus traced back till it
</p>
<p>disappears. The same is true of the doctrine of auricular
</p>
<p>confession that great engine of Papal and priestly des-
</p>
<p>potism.
</p>
<p>So also the doctrines of transubstantiation, purgatory,
</p>
<p>saint and image worship, and the whole system of sacra-
</p>
<p>mental regeneration and sanctification can be traced back
</p>
<p>till they vanish, and the last fragment of Romanism, either
</p>
<p>in doctrine or in government, utterly disappears.
</p>
<p>The creation of the peculiar doctrines of Romanism
</p>
<p>was not so entirely effected by forgery as was the existing
</p>
<p>Papal corporation and form of goverment ; and, as this is
</p>
<p>the central power of the system, my main purpose calls
</p>
<p>for a more particular exposure of this.
</p>
<p>It is well for the community that this is a mere question
</p>
<p>of historical fact. It is a question of unspeakable interest,
</p>
<p>not only to our country, but to the world. If the Papal
</p>
<p>corporation is a fraud, created by unprincipled forgery,

<p>CHAPTER III.
</p>
<p>FORMATION OF THE ROMISH CORPORATION.
</p>
<p>THERE is to be, as I have said, an historical day of
</p>
<p>judgment. God has come on burning wheels ; fiery flames
</p>
<p>precede him ; the thrones are set, the books are opened,
</p>
<p>and the Romish corporation and their head are summoned
</p>
<p>before his bar to answer for their arrogant pretences and
</p>
<p>bloody deeds.
</p>
<p>Let us, then, open the pages of the book of history be-
</p>
<p>fore the bar of this almighty and impartial Judge, and
</p>
<p>listen to their testimony against the corporation of Rome.
</p>
<p>The time covered by the claim of the Romish corpora-
</p>
<p>tion includes nearly nineteen centuries. They exhibit to
</p>
<p>the world an unbroken line of popes, stretching across
</p>
<p>this vast tract of time, and terminating, as they allege,
</p>
<p>with Peter at Rome.
</p>
<p>To unlearned Romanists, and to others who know what
</p>
<p>the pope now is, it appears as if the Papal leaders taught
</p>
<p>that a line of such popes extended back to that time.
</p>
<p>Such, we do not doubt, is the impression which they mean
</p>
<p>to convey.
</p>
<p>If the history of this long period were familiarly known,
</p>
<p>such a claim would appear little less than ridiculous insan
</p>
<p>ity, if its impiety did not eclipse every other consideration.
</p>
<p>But there is no popular knowledge of this period, and
</p>
<p>therefore no ability to treat such a claim as it deserves.

<p>240 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>Of course it is not possible within my limits to give so
</p>
<p>extended a history in full ; but I can with ease make some
</p>
<p>general statements which will dissipate the Papal delusion
</p>
<p>to which I have adverted and place the great facts of the
</p>
<p>case in a true light.
</p>
<p>Bishop Kenrick, of Philadelphia, has given us a list of
</p>
<p>two hundred and fifty persons, called popes, who are said
</p>
<p>to have reigned during this time, ending with Gregory
</p>
<p>XVI. Daunou, a French Catholic, has also given us a list
</p>
<p>of two hundred and sixty-three, terminating with the same
</p>
<p>pope. Bishop Kenrick says that " the number varies ac-
</p>
<p>cording as certain individuals are considered intruders or
</p>
<p>lawful popes." (Primacy, p. 488.) It appears, then, that
</p>
<p>Romanists are not always agreed who are the true popes.
</p>
<p>The bishop says, " It is a matter for critical inquiry." This
</p>
<p>I think any one will concede who attempts to look into
</p>
<p>the matter. To settle all questions involved in the Papal
</p>
<p>schisms and the claims of anti-popes will require a very
</p>
<p>critical inquiry, and at the best lead to very doubtful re-
</p>
<p>sults, as is plain from the divisions of Romanists on the
</p>
<p>subject.
</p>
<p>But this long list of popes may be divided- into six
</p>
<p>classes, according to the state of the civil governments of
</p>
<p>the world.
</p>
<p>The first class includes those who were under the Ro-
</p>
<p>man empire for three centuries before the conversion of
</p>
<p>Constantino to Christianity. Of these thirty-two are
</p>
<p>given by Kenrick and Daunou, up to Sylvester, by whom,
</p>
<p>as we are told by certain notorious Roman forgers, Con-
</p>
<p>stantine was baptized, and to whom, the same forgers tell
</p>
<p>us, he gave his palace, Rome, and the Empire of the West.
</p>
<p>The second class includes those who were under the Ro-
</p>
<p>man empire from the conversion of Constantino till its down-

</p>
<p>fall in 476 a space of nearly two centuries. Of these
</p>
<p>FORMATION OP THE ROMISH CORPORATION. 241
</p>
<p>there are given thirteen by Daunou and Kenrick, includ-
</p>
<p>ing Leo L, soon after whom Rome fell.
</p>
<p>Though Pope Leo I. died fifteen years before the fall
</p>
<p>of Rome, yet I select him because he was the leading
</p>
<p>spirit of that age, and the master builder who first made
</p>
<p>Peter the basis of the Roman claim of supremacy of juris-
</p>
<p>diction and spiritual power.
</p>
<p>In these two periods lived the early Christian writers
</p>
<p>commonly known as the fathers as, for example, Augus-
</p>
<p>tine, Bishop of Hippo, Chrysostom, Bishop of Constanti-
</p>
<p>nople, Ambrose, Bishop of Milan. Of these the see of
</p>
<p>Rome furnished none except Leo just before the city fell.
</p>
<p>The third class consists of those who were under the
</p>
<p>government of the barbarian conquerors of Rome, or of
</p>
<p>the Emperors of Constantinople when they reconquered
</p>
<p>Rome, until the revival of the Empire of the "West by
</p>
<p>Charlemagne in the year 800 a space of three centuries
</p>
<p>and a quarter. Of these fifty-two are given by Kenrick
</p>
<p>and fifty-one by Daunou, including Leo III., by whom
</p>
<p>Charlemagne was crowned.
</p>
<p>In this period there were a few writers in the first cen-
</p>
<p>tury, of whom Pope Gregory, called the Great, is chief.
</p>
<p>The last two centuries from 600 were the beginning of the
</p>
<p>midnight of the dark ages.
</p>
<p>The fourth class consists of those who lived between
</p>
<p>Charlemagne, A. D. 800, and the celebrated Gregory VII.,
</p>
<p>A. D. 1073-85, called sometimes Hildebrand, and regarded
</p>
<p>as the Napoleon of the Romish corporation. Of these
</p>
<p>sixty-four are enumerated by Daunou and fifty-six by
</p>
<p>Kenrick.
</p>
<p>During this period no great writers meet us. "We are
</p>
<p>still in the midnight of the dark ages, notwithstanding
</p>
<p>a transient gleam of light around Charlemagne. These
</p>
<p>last two periods are the ages of forgery and fraud. Soon

<p>242 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>after 1000, however, the period of the scholastic divines
</p>
<p>opened. There we see Anselm, Lanfranck, Abelard.
</p>
<p>The fifth class includes the popes from Gregory VII. to
</p>
<p>the reformation under Leo X., A. D. 1514. This period
</p>
<p>extends through about four centuries, and contains sixty
</p>
<p>popes according to Kenrick, and sixty-six according to
</p>
<p>Daunou.
</p>
<p>This is by way of eminence the Papal period. In it the
</p>
<p>existing corporation of Rome was first fully organized on
</p>
<p>foundations and of materials previously forged. In it the
</p>
<p>peculiar doctrines of Romanism which are the sinews of
</p>
<p>its power and the sources of profit were fully developed
</p>
<p>and established. This is the period of the crusades and of
</p>
<p>scholastic divinity ; this, too, is the period of Papal art.
</p>
<p>The sixth class extends from the reformation to the
</p>
<p>present day, a period of about three centuries and a
</p>
<p>half, and contains thirty-eight popes according to both
</p>
<p>Kenrick and Daunou. In this period began the great
</p>
<p>work of exposing the forgeries and frauds of Rome 1 , which
</p>
<p>is yet to be completed.
</p>
<p>It has been a period of intense intellectual activity ;
</p>
<p>especially has it been remarkable as an age of historical
</p>
<p>and critical development. The study of history was once
</p>
<p>confined to the leading few ; it has during this period
</p>
<p>descended more and more to the people. We, as a nation
</p>
<p>of self-governing freemen, above all others need to be well
</p>
<p>versed in history, and especially in the history of that
</p>
<p>corporation whose origin and formation it is my purpose
</p>
<p>now to illustrate in a survey of the divisions which have
</p>
<p>been made.
</p>
<p>To impress this division more strongly upon the mind,
</p>
<p>and to aid the power of conception when I shall speak of

</p>
<p>For the sake of symmetry and convenience, I place the
</p>
<p>name of Constantino upon the year 300, though he began
</p>
<p>to reign about a quarter of a century later ; so also I
</p>
<p>place the fall of Home on 500, though it was on 476 ; and
</p>
<p>Gregory VII. on 1100, though he reigned A. D. 1073-85 j
</p>
<p>and Leo X. on 1500, though he reigned a little later.
</p>
<p>I wish simply to impress the great outlines of the division.
</p>
<p>I also place Sylvester with Constantino, Henry IV. of
</p>
<p>Germany with Gregory VII., and Luther and Charles V.
</p>
<p>with Leo X. for similar reasons. Into the fifth period I
</p>
<p>introduce, on 1200 and 1300, Innocent III. and Boniface
</p>
<p>VIII. for reasons soon to be stated.
</p>
<p>THE DELUSION.
</p>
<p>The delusion which the Romish corporation leaves upon
</p>
<p>the minds of the ignorant masses of the Romanists is now
</p>
<p>apparent. It is that the Romish corporation stretches
</p>
<p>back through this vast tract of time just as it is till it
</p>
<p>reaches the throne of Peter, the great prince of the
</p>
<p>apostles.
</p>
<p>"Words cannot express the magnitude and extent of the
</p>
<p>falsehood involved in this impression and how utterly
</p>
<p>unlike it is to the real course of events.
</p>
<p>I will try briefly to flash out these ideas by a simple
</p>
<p>and significant illustration.
</p>
<p>If, when standing in St. Peter's or the Vatican, some
</p>
<p>intelligent traveller should ask who erected these splen-
</p>
<p>did structures, and be told the holy apostles Peter and
</p>
<p>Paul ; they fixed on Rome as the centre of the empire
</p>
<p>of Christ, and, knowing the importance of a central
</p>
<p>church and a palace of suitable splendor, they laid out

</p>
<p>on which the apostle Peter used to sit, and in this pal-
</p>
<p>ace he once lived in royal splendor, he would not hes-

<p>itate to call the whole story an audacious lie. Do I not
</p>
<p>know, he would say, that the thing is, in the nature of the
</p>
<p>case, absurd and impossible ? Was not Rome the very
</p>
<p>centre of the resistless power of the Roman empire ?
</p>
<p>Was not the palace of the CaBsars there ? Was it not the
</p>
<p>centre of Roman polytheism ? Was it not the abode of
</p>
<p>the Pontifex Maximus ? Were not all of these vast pow-
</p>
<p>ers arrayed in deadly conflict with the religion of Christ ?
</p>
<p>Was not that the age of persecution and martyrdom ?
</p>
<p>Were not the first Christians, as a general fact, poor and

<p>unlearned ? Was it not true, as Paul says, not many
</p>
<p>wise, not many mighty, not many noble were called ?
</p>
<p>And was not Paul carried a prisoner to Rome ? and did he
</p>
<p>not at last die there as a martyr ? And did not Peter,
</p>
<p>too, die a martyr's death on the cross ? And are these
</p>
<p>the times and these the men to erect such a church and
</p>
<p>such a palace, before the eyes of the emperor, in the very
</p>
<p>centre of persecuting Rome ? Then, opening some authen-
</p>
<p>tic book of history, he would find the time when in fact
</p>
<p>these structures were commenced, the persons by whom
</p>
<p>and the means by which they were continued and com-
</p>
<p>pleted, and, by a statement of the truth, cover his false
</p>
<p>informers with shame and infamy.
</p>
<p>And yet frauds infinitely greater have been practised
</p>

<p>by the pope, and they are not yet covered with shame

<p>supreme spiritual authority over the human race ; and to
</p>
<p>them we are now referred as our only sure guides in the
</p>
<p>discovery of truth, and as the only medium through which
</p>
<p>we can reach heaven.
</p>
<p>Nor is this all. They have shed the blood of millions
</p>
<p>for denying these claims ; and this Mr. Brownson now
</p>
<p>defends as only an exercise of legitimate authority. Nor
</p>
<p>is this all. He claims a supremacy for the institutions of
</p>
<p>this corporation over our national institutions on the
</p>
<p>ground that what is of man must give way before what
</p>
<p>is of God.
</p>
<p>Let us, then, consider in the light of history the actual
</p>
<p>process in the formation of the Romish corporation.
</p>
<p>The fabric of this corporation, as it now stands, may be
</p>
<p>compared to St. Peter's Church at Rome. As that in its
</p>
<p>magnitude exceeds all other churches, so is this the great-
</p>
<p>est fabric of ecclesiastical architecture ever known on
</p>
<p>earth. The pope, the cardinals, the patriarchs, the me-
</p>
<p>tropolitans, the bishops, the priests, the deacons are all
</p>
<p>organized in a vast system, extending itself over the
</p>
<p>globe and aiming at universal conquest. In it are the
</p>
<p>various orders of monks, nuns, Jesuits, bound to it by
</p>
<p>oaths and sworn to extend its sway.
</p>
<p>When was the fabric erected ? By whom ? How ?
</p>
<p>How did the pope gain his powers and become the centre
</p>
<p>of such a system ? To these questions but two answers
</p>
<p>can be given. The first, that of Rome God thus ordained
</p>
<p>from the beginning. The other I have given it is a
</p>
<p>stupendous fraud of the devil. Look, then, at the first
</p>
<p>centuries days of persecution, weakness, martyrdom.
</p>
<p>Is it not on the face of things as absurd to think it then
</p>
<p>put up by the apostles as to think that Paul and Peter

<p>built St. Peter's Church and the Vatican ?
</p>
<p>FORMATION OF THE ROMISH CORPORATION. 247
</p>
<p>FIRST CLASS OF POPES.
</p>
<p>Where, then, was the temporal power of the pope
</p>
<p>when the palace of the Caesars was at Rome, when Paul
</p>
<p>died there as a martyr, when persecution after persecution
</p>
<p>filled the empire with the blood of the slain ?
</p>
<p>Where, then, was the body of cardinal princes clothed
</p>
<p>in scarlet ? Where the oath to obey the pope ? Where
</p>
<p>his supreme judicial, legislative, and executive authority ?
</p>
<p>Whore were the general councils ? Where the canon
</p>
<p>law ? What single part of the present great fabric can
</p>
<p>be found there ? Not one. Mr. Newman is forced to
</p>
<p>confess that the existing system was not then erected ;
</p>
<p>not a particle of it could be seen. And history, with
</p>
<p>irresistible power, repudiates every claim of Rome. All
</p>
<p>churches were then equal and independent ; neither they
</p>
<p>nor their pastors claimed authority over each other.
</p>
<p>There was then no corporation of any kind in existence.
</p>
<p>It was nearly two centuries before they even began to act
</p>
<p>together in synods.
</p>
<p>All this is notorious, and is conceded by all church
</p>
<p>historians of any candor. But it is of still greater mo-
</p>
<p>ment that it can be proved to have been the view held at
</p>
<p>Rome, where the Romanists assure us that Peter, the
</p>
<p>prince of the apostles, the great head of the church, had
</p>
<p>established his see and transferred his power to his suc-
</p>
<p>cessors, who, if these assertions are true, must have had

<p>some knowledge of the fact.
</p>
<p>248 THE PAPAL CONSPIBACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>CLEMENT'S LETTER.
</p>
<p>After Peter, if we may trust tradition, came Linus,
</p>
<p>and then Cletus, or Anacletus. Of these two little or
</p>
<p>nothing is known or said. Then comes a real person
</p>
<p>and a writer well known Clement, son of Faustinus, a
</p>
<p>Roman. He was really the pastor of the church of Rome.
</p>
<p>According to Origen, Eusebius, and all the ancients, says
</p>
<p>Bower, he is the person whom Paul, in his Epistle to the
</p>
<p>Philippians, names among those who had labored with
</p>
<p>him in the gospel and whose names were in the book of
</p>
<p>life. From him there has come down to us one true and
</p>
<p>genuine epistle.
</p>
<p>It is also a long epistle. Moreover it is an epistle on
</p>
<p>a subject directly adapted to bring out the Papal prerog-
</p>
<p>atives of Clement, if he had any. The epistle informs us
</p>
<p>that the church of Corinth had deposed some of their
</p>
<p>presbyters and were in a state of painful division.
</p>
<p>Clement and the church at Rome deemed this deposition
</p>
<p>groundless in view of the statements of the church at
</p>
<p>Corinth which had been laid before them for advice.
</p>
<p>Have we not here a test question ? If Clement, the fel-
</p>
<p>low-laborer of Paul, the contemporary of Peter, had
</p>
<p>known even the A B C of the present Papal system,
</p>
<p>would he not at once have commanded the church at Cor-
</p>
<p>inth, in the name of Almighty God and of the blessed
</p>
<p>apostles Peter and Paul, and on peril of their wrath, to
</p>
<p>restore these deposed presbyters ?
</p>
<p>Did he do it ? Nay ; he did no such thing. On the oth-
</p>
<p>er hand, he conceded that the Corinthian church had not
</p>
<p>exceeded their legal power and that he had no power
</p>
<p>over them ; but he tried to convince them that they had

</p>
<p>exercised their power unjustly and to persuade them to
</p>
<p>FORMATION OP THE ROMISH CORPORATION. 249
</p>
<p>restore the deposed bishops. He tells them that the de-
</p>
<p>posed bishops had been properly chosen by the whole
</p>
<p>church, and had long served the flock of Christ humbly,
</p>
<p>quietly, liberally, without censure, and with a good repu-
</p>
<p>tation among all. "These," says he, "we think cannot be
</p>
<p>justly deposed from their office ; for it will be no small
</p>
<p>sin to depose from their office as bishops those who have
</p>
<p>performed their duties holily and without reproach."
</p>
<p>Nor is this the whole strength of the case. Clement
</p>
<p>does not even speak in his own name at all. He sinks
</p>
<p>himself out of sight. He speaks simply as the mouth of
</p>
<p>the church of Rome.
</p>
<p>Let us compare the opening of the bull of Pius Y. in
</p>
<p>which he announced the excommunication and damnation
</p>
<p>of Elizabeth, Queen of England, with the opening of the
</p>
<p>letter of Clement :
</p>
<p>" Pius, bishop, servant of the servants of God : for a
</p>
<p>perpetual memorial of the matter. He that reigneth on
</p>
<p>high, to whom is given all power in heaven and in earth,
</p>
<p>committed one holy Catholic church, out of which there
</p>
<p>is no salvation, to one alone on earth namely, to Peter,
</p>
<p>the prince of the apostles, and to Peter's successor, the
</p>
<p>Bishop of Rome, to be governed in fulness of power," &c.
</p>
<p>Clement begins his letter thus :
</p>
<p>" The church of God dwelling at Rome to the church
</p>
<p>of God dwelling at Corinth, called and sanctified by the
</p>
<p>divine will through our Lord Jesus Christ : grace and
</p>
<p>peace be multiplied to you by Almighty God, through
</p>
<p>Jesus Christ."
</p>
<p>The writer then proceeds to praise the Corinthians for
</p>
<p>their former good conduct and to exhort them to heal
</p>
<p>their divisions and to restore their deposed bishops. His
</p>
<p>motives are derived from the examples of other ages and

<p>from the words of Scripture. The government of the
</p>
<p>250 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>Corinthian church was plainly in the hands of the people,
</p>
<p>and all that the Roman church did was to advise and
</p>
<p>exhort.
</p>
<p>So plain is this case that Waddington, an Episcopal his-
</p>
<p>torian, says of the church in Corinth, " The Episcopal
</p>
<p>form of government was clearly not yet here established."
</p>
<p>It is no less plain that, if there was a bishop at Rome, he
</p>
<p>was not a modern pope. He says nothing of Peter's see,
</p>
<p>nothing of himself, nothing of the wrath of Almighty
</p>
<p>God and the blessed apostles Paul and Peter on all in the
</p>
<p>church of Corinth who will not obey his bull. Neither
</p>
<p>he nor the church claim any other power or authority than
</p>
<p>that of Christian advice, expostulation, and exhortation.
</p>
<p>And yet the case was one of great moment and of great
</p>
<p>urgency, as is evident from the very nature of the facts
</p>
<p>stated and from the earnest entreaties of the letter.
</p>
<p>I know not how a more pointed repudiation of all the
</p>
<p>present claims of the Papacy could have been made.
</p>
<p>How little this letter is adapted to meet the ideas of
</p>
<p>the Romish corporation will soon become plain when we
</p>
<p>shall come to consider certain letters afterwards forged
</p>
<p>by them in the name of Clement in order to accomplish
</p>
<p>their ambitious ends. They, in their forgeries, make
</p>
<p>Clement speak to some purpose. The whole story as to
</p>
<p>Peter is at his tongue's end.
</p>
<p>The strength of this case cannot be over-estimated.
</p>
<p>Bower well remarks, " Had he known himself to be the un-
</p>
<p>erring judge of controversies, there had been no room for
</p>
<p>persuasions : he ought to have exercised his power and put
</p>
<p>an end to all disputes in the peremptory style of his succes-

<p>sors." So much for Pope Clement.
</p>
<p>FORMATION OF THE ROMISH CORPORATION. 251
</p>
<p>PIUS I.
</p>
<p>Let us pass over Popes Evaristus, Alexander I., Six-
</p>
<p>tus I., Telesphorus, and Hyginus, of whom very little
</p>
<p>is known, and come to Pius L, A. D. 142-157. Under
</p>
<p>him occurred another event which completely annihilates
</p>
<p>all the pretensions of the Papal corporation. Marcion, of
</p>
<p>Sinope, had been excommunicated from the church of his
</p>
<p>father, a bishop of the Catholic communion, for certain
</p>
<p>grave offences. He fled to Rome and prayed to be ad-
</p>
<p>mitted to their communion. The church of Rome told
</p>
<p>him, as Epiphanius testifies, " We cannot admit you with-
</p>
<p>out leave from your holy father ; NOR CAN WE, AS WE
</p>
<p>ARE ALL UNITED IN THE SAME FAITH AND THE SAME SEN-
</p>
<p>TDIEXTS, UNDO WHAT OUR HOLY COLLEAGUE, YOUR HOLY
</p>
<p>FATHER, HAS DONE."
</p>
<p>Can any thing be more decisive than this fact ? Is not
</p>
<p>this an absolute and direct disavowal of the supremacy
</p>
<p>claimed by the Papists for the church of Rome ? Is it not
</p>
<p>an avowal of the doctrine that all churches are equal and
</p>
<p>independent, and that no one has a right to overrule or
</p>
<p>reverse the decision of another ? This was in the middle
</p>
<p>of the second century, and proves that up to that time
</p>
<p>the primitive equality of the churches was fully acknowl-
</p>
<p>edged and avowed even at Rome. The incursions of
</p>
<p>clerical ambition had not then begun.
</p>
<p>On this narrative Bower keenly remarks, " Had Bellar
</p>
<p>mine lived in those days he had taught them another doc-
</p>
<p>trine, a doctrine which, however necessary, the apostles
</p>
<p>had forgot to deliver to their disciples, viz., that the see of
</p>
<p>Rome was raised above all other sees ; that the appeals
</p>
<p>of the whole Catholic church were to be brought to it ;

<p>that no appeals were to be made from it ; that it was to

<p>252 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>judge of the whole church^ but be judged by none. Mar-
</p>
<p>cion did not apply to Pius, or at least to him alone, but to
</p>
<p>the elders, who disclaimed all power of reversing the
</p>
<p>sentence of a particular bishop. And is not this an evi-
</p>
<p>dent and incontestable proof that the power of receiving
</p>
<p>appeals was not known or thought of in those days ? "
</p>
<p>The next pope, Anicetus, and Polycarp, Bishop of Smyr-
</p>
<p>na, differed as to the time of the celebration of Easter, and
</p>
<p>could not convince each other ; but the pope did not com-
</p>
<p>mand, nor Polycarp obey, but each followed "his own
</p>
<p>opinions. Passing by Soter and Eleutherius, we come to
</p>
<p>Victor, A. D. 192-201.
</p>
<p>ROMAN ARROGANCE DEVELOPED.
</p>
<p>Here we meet the first manifestation of episcopal arro-
</p>
<p>gance in the Bishop of Rome ; and now a course of events
</p>
<p>opens upon us of this kind. Claims are made by the
</p>
<p>Romish bishops and repudiated by the churches at large,
</p>
<p>but persevered in by their successors and referred back to
</p>
<p>as precedents. Hallam remarks as to such claims, " In the
</p>
<p>history of all usurping governments time changes anomaly
</p>
<p>into system and injury into right ; examples beget custon^
</p>
<p>and custom r-ipens into law ; and the doubtful precedent
</p>
<p>of one generation becomes the fundamental maxim of
</p>
<p>another."
</p>
<p>In the case of Victor, we see the first effort of the
</p>
<p>Bishop of Rome to exert a power of making law for the
</p>
<p>churches. Not following the example of Anicetus in the
</p>
<p>case of Polycarp, he undertook to impose the Roman view
</p>
<p>of Easter on Polycrates and the Bishops of Asia Minor,
</p>
<p>and excommunicated them for refusing to conform. But

</p>
<p>the other churches of the Christian world repudiated this
</p>
<p>FORMATION OP THE ROMISH CORPORATION. 253
</p>
<p>arrogant proceeding and rendefed it null and void. Thus
</p>
<p>it is not until the end of the second century that the
</p>
<p>Bishop of Rome put forth claims to jurisdiction over other
</p>
<p>churches, and then they were universally repudiated.
</p>
<p>Passing by Zephyrinus, Callistus, Urbanus, Pontianus,
</p>
<p>A.nterus, Fabianus, Cornelius, and Lucius, we come to
</p>
<p>Stephen, who made an effort like that of Victor to ex-
</p>
<p>communicate Cyprian and a council of African bishops
</p>
<p>for refusing to adopt his views of the baptism of heretics.
</p>
<p>This also was repudiated and rendered powerless by the
</p>
<p>other churches of the age.
</p>
<p>Passing over Sixtus II., Dionysius, Felix, Eutychianus,
</p>
<p>Caius, Marcellinus, Marcellus, Eusebius, and Melchiades,
</p>
<p>we come to Sylvester, by whom Constantino was said by
</p>
<p>the Roman forgers to have been baptized.
</p>
<p>Thus it appears that in the first century, and up to the
</p>
<p>middle of the second, the Papal system not only did not
</p>
<p>exist at Rome, but was distinctly repudiated and de-
</p>
<p>nounced. Nor up to the time of Constantine can any evi-
</p>
<p>dence be found of any admitted authority of the church
</p>
<p>or Pope of Rome over the other churches. All that we
</p>
<p>discover is an effort of a few popes to assert such "author-
</p>
<p>ity, which was at once and indignantly repudiated.
</p>
<p>It appears that though the bishops of the churches ad-
</p>
<p>vised with and consulted each other and met in synods
</p>
<p>during the third century, yet they were all regarded as
</p>
<p>equal and independent.
</p>
<p>This view of the case is very strongly confirmed by a
</p>
<p>forgery which was made towards the close of the third
</p>
<p>century, designed to give authority and system to the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment, rites, and usages of the churches at that time.
</p>
<p>It is called the Apostolic Constitutions and Canons ; and
</p>
<p>it aimed, by the high authority of the apostles, to establish
</p>
<p>and augment the power of each bishop in his own church

</p>
<p>and to regulate all church usages by definite rules. It was
</p>
<p>made in the names of all the apostles, and is the first great
</p>
<p>systematic and regular forgery of this kind. It is divided
</p>
<p>into eight books, and professes fully to describe the pow-
</p>
<p>ers of bishops, and of all the clergy, and the whole order
</p>
<p>of the church. But it is a most significant fact that in it
</p>
<p>there is found no place for the supremacy of the pope or
</p>
<p>of the church of Rome.
</p>
<p>It introduces all the apostles by name in the eighth
</p>
<p>book, and, without hinting at the supremacy of Peter,
</p>
<p>represents them as individually ordaining constitutions.
</p>
<p>Moreover it is careful to represent them as independent
</p>
<p>and equal. There is over them no primate or prince. It is
</p>
<p>a book of two hundred and fifty-seven octavo pages ; and
</p>
<p>yet it may be searched through from beginning to end with-
</p>
<p>out finding any thing that in the least degree countenances
</p>
<p>the existing claims of the Papal corporation. On the
</p>
<p>other hand, we find in it the same views of the independ-
</p>
<p>ent authority and equality of all bishops, and of the
</p>
<p>mode in which they ought to concur in church unity, which
</p>
<p>are found in the works of Cyprian.
</p>
<p>I have thus finished the first and earliest class of the so
</p>
<p>called popes. Two things are now undeniable : the first,
</p>
<p>that the testimony of this class is the most important ; the
</p>
<p>second, that the testimony of the earliest popes is decisive
</p>
<p>against all the claims of Rome.
</p>
<p>It now remains that I show how these claims were in-
</p>
<p>troduced and that the whole system is based on forgery
</p>
<p>and fraud.
</p>
<p>In order, however, to understand the course of event?,
</p>
<p>it is necessary to glance at the state of the Roman em-
</p>
<p>pire during the period in which the second and third
</p>
<p>classes of popes lived.

</p>
<p>Any history will inform us that Constantine founded
</p>
<p>FORMATION OF THE ROMISH CORPORATION.
</p>
<p>another seat of empire at Byzantium, greatly enlarging
</p>
<p>and adorning the original city, and calling it the city of
</p>
<p>Constantine, or Constantinople.
</p>
<p>Afterwards the empire was divided into the Western
</p>
<p>Empire, of which Rome was the capital ; and the Eastern
</p>
<p>Empire, of which Constantinople was the capital.
</p>
<p>In the year 476 the Western Empire fell, being con-
</p>
<p>quered by Odoacer, King of the Heruli. After this, till
</p>
<p>the year 800, Rome was sometimes under the sway of the
</p>
<p>barbarians, and at other times it was reconquered from
</p>
<p>them and ruled by the Emperor of Constantinople.
</p>
<p>Now, with regard to the Bishops of Rome during both
</p>
<p>of these periods, two great facts are prominent : 1. They
</p>
<p>were not temporal rulers of Rome or of any other territo-
</p>
<p>ry, either as independent or as dependent sovereigns ; they
</p>
<p>were subject to whatever civil power ruled Rome, whether
</p>
<p>barbarian or Greek. 2. Their chief contest was with the
</p>
<p>Bishop of Constantinople for a certain kind of spiritual
</p>
<p>supremacy.
</p>
<p>In order to see how this came to pass, let us look at the
</p>
<p>condition of the second class of the popes i. e., the Bish-
</p>
<p>ops of Rome.
</p>
<p>After the conversion of Constantino a new state of things
</p>
<p>was introduced among the bishops at large. Christianity
</p>
<p>having become the religion of the empire, the churches
</p>
<p>were favored and endowed and the bishops honored and
</p>
<p>exalted in power. In addition to this, they were regu-
</p>
<p>larly organized into hierarchal combinations according
</p>
<p>to the divisions of the empire. As in every province there
</p>
<p>was a chief city or metropolis, and as the bishop of this
</p>
<p>city had already been appointed metropolitan bishop to
</p>
<p>preside over the others even in the third century, so this
</p>
<p>system was confirmed by Constantine.

<p>256 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>cities of the empire into patriarcliat.es, and the bishops
</p>
<p>of these cities were appointed patriarchs, and the metro-
</p>
<p>politans and other bishops were subordinated to them.
</p>
<p>Thus, around Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch,
</p>
<p>and Jerusalem, after some changes, were patriarchates
</p>
<p>finally formed, and their bishops became rival patriarchs.
</p>
<p>Of these bishops, the dignity was according to that of
</p>
<p>the city in which their see was located. Of course the
</p>
<p>patriarch of old Rome stood highest ; the patriarch of
</p>
<p>Constantinople next ; and after them the patriarchs of Al-
</p>
<p>exandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>During this period also the practice of calling general
</p>
<p>councils to represent the whole Christian world was in-
</p>
<p>troduced.
</p>
<p>Concerning this period three things deserve special no-
</p>
<p>tice : 1. That during it the civil authority of the emperors
</p>
<p>over the bishops was supreme ; and it was the emperors,
</p>
<p>and not any of the bishops, who called the general coun-
</p>
<p>cils. 2. In these general councils canons were made di-
</p>
<p>rectly at war with the present pretensions of the Bishop
</p>
<p>of Rome. 3. At the close of this period the Bishop of
</p>
<p>Rome was in imminent danger of losing the basis of his
</p>
<p>superior honor and influence by the downfall of Rome, and
</p>
<p>was obliged to invent a new basis on which to rest his
</p>
<p>claims, and also higher claims of jurisdiction. The im-
</p>
<p>portance of these statements will become more clear in
</p>
<p>view of the following narrative of facts.
</p>
<p>The first general council was that of Nice, A. D. 325.
</p>
<p>This was called, not by the Bishop of Rome, but by the
</p>
<p>Emperor Constantine. Nor did the pope or his legate
</p>
<p>preside in it. Thus are all his present claims to call coun-
</p>
<p>cils and preside in them negatived.

<p>ecclesiastical causes to be finally decided in each province
</p>
<p>FORMATION OP THE ROMISH CORPORATION. 257
</p>
<p>by a provincial synod thus cutting up by the roots the
</p>
<p>present claims of the Pope of Rome to supreme jurisdic-
</p>
<p>tion and to receive appeals in all cases and from all quar-
</p>
<p>ters. Against this even Binius makes no reply. It is
</p>
<p>true that after this, under Pope Julius, a small provincial
</p>
<p>council convened in Sardica, the metropolis of Dacia, in
</p>
<p>Illyricum, introduced and authorized the practice of ap-
</p>
<p>pealing to the Pope of Rome. But a provincial council
</p>
<p>cannot lawfully repeal the canons of a general council,
</p>
<p>the Romish corporation being judge. Moreover, under
</p>
<p>Damasus, a council convened by the Emperor Theodosius
</p>
<p>at Constantinople expressed their disapprobation of the
</p>
<p>doings of the council of Sardica by renewing and con-
</p>
<p>firming the decision of the council of Nice.
</p>
<p>The Bishops of Rome, in fact, confessed the insufficiency
</p>
<p>of the decree of the council of Sardica by trying to palm
</p>
<p>it off as a decree of a general council. It was Pope Celes-
</p>
<p>tine (A. D. 422-32) who undertook this work of fraud.
</p>
<p>He attempted to impose upon a council of African bish-
</p>
<p>ops the canons of Sardica as being canons of Nice, in or-
</p>
<p>der to obtain the authority of that general council for his
</p>
<p>claim to the right of receiving appeals. How early did
</p>
<p>Rome begin her great work of fraud ! The African bish-
</p>
<p>ops, however, at last detected the imposition, and severally
</p>
<p>rebuked the successor of Celestine for the unprincipled
</p>
<p>conduct of his predecessor.
</p>
<p>Nor is this all. In the second general council of Con-
</p>
<p>stantinople it was decided that the Bishop of Constan-
</p>
<p>tinople had equal rank with the Bishop of Rome.
</p>
<p>In the fourth general council, at Chalcedon, it waa
</p>
<p>expressly declared that the peculiar dignity and authority
</p>
<p>of the patriarchs of Rome and Constantinople were de-
</p>
<p>rived from the political importance of the capital cities of
</p>
<p>the empire.

<p>258 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>Here, then, we see the first three general councils all
</p>
<p>fundamentally at war with the present pretensions of
</p>
<p>Rome. What can be more decisive ? Notice in particu-
</p>
<p>lar that the doctrine of the council of Chalcedon is DI-
</p>
<p>KE CTLY AT WAR WITH THE ROMISH CLAIM OF SUPREMACY
</p>
<p>ON THE GROUND OF THE SUPREMACY OF PETER.
</p>
<p>It became plain also that, if Rome should fall and Con-
</p>
<p>stantinople stand, the Bishop of Rome must also fall and
</p>
<p>the Bishop of Constantinople remain supreme.
</p>
<p>It was plain also that the downfall of Rome was at
</p>
<p>hand. Hence it became imperatively necessary to invent
</p>
<p>and establish a new basis for the claims of the Roman
</p>
<p>bishop which would survive that downfall. It was the
</p>
<p>province of Leo L, the Great, to perform this work by
</p>
<p>substituting the authority of Peter for the dignity of
</p>
<p>Rome. Of this change I shall elsewhere speak more at
</p>
<p>large. It is the first great point in the history of the
</p>
<p>Papacy.
</p>
<p>So much for the second class of popes. Let us pass to
</p>
<p>the third. During the three centuries that followed the
</p>
<p>downfall of Rome, the ideas of Leo as to Peter's suprem-
</p>
<p>acy and the claims of the pope founded thereon were
</p>
<p>germinating and preparing the way for a universal spirit-
</p>
<p>ual empire among the ignorant and credulous barbarians.
</p>
<p>Meantime three of the Eastern patriarchs were humbled
</p>
<p>by the onset of the hosts of Mahomet those of Alexan-
</p>
<p>dria, Antioch, and Jerusalem. These cities fell before the
</p>
<p>invaders. Constantinople only remained. Meantime new
</p>
<p>national churches in Western Europe were rising in the
</p>
<p>young and vigorous kingdoms founded by the German
</p>
<p>conquerors of Rome. Here then, as soon was evident,
</p>
<p>was to be the field of the spiritual monarchy ; for Con-
</p>
<p>stantinople was declining, and destined at last to fall.

</p>
<p>During the greater part of this period Rome was subject
</p>
<p>FORMATION OP THE ROMISH CORPORATION. 259
</p>
<p>to the Emperor of Constantinople, but was so far distant,
</p>
<p>and was so exposed to the inroads of the barbarians, that
</p>
<p>it threw great responsibilities on the bishop, and sug-
</p>
<p>gested to him the idea of a temporal as well as a spiritual
</p>
<p>monarchy.
</p>
<p>"We now come to the fourth class of popes. After the vi-
</p>
<p>cissitudes of the last period and the weakening of the East
</p>
<p>by the Mahometan powers a new centre of power arises in
</p>
<p>the West. The old Roman empire of the West, that for
</p>
<p>centuries had been dead, is revived once more ; and Charle-
</p>
<p>magne is at its head, crowned by Pope Leo III. Charles
</p>
<p>Augustus, Emperor of the holy Roman empire.
</p>
<p>We have now come to the point where the principle of
</p>
<p>forgery is to disclose itself in all its magnitude in these
</p>
<p>ages of the deepest ignorance until the two great concep-
</p>
<p>tions of a spiritual and temporal monarchy were realized.
</p>
<p>Leo I. had developed, as the foundation of the spiritual
</p>
<p>monarchy, the rock Peter ; and now the basis of the
</p>
<p>temporal monarchy was laid by a forged donation of Con-
</p>
<p>stantine. Moreover the plan of the spiritual monarchy
</p>
<p>was drawn, and its materials provided, and an effort made
</p>
<p>to erect it. By the fifth class of popes the fabric was
</p>
<p>erected and finished, and stood in great power till the
</p>
<p>time of the reformation. Under the sixth and last class
</p>
<p>of popes it has been assailed by the Protestants for three
</p>
<p>hundred years. In this assault we are now summoned
</p>
<p>anew to engage. Nor will it cease till the whole fabric
</p>
<p>is utterly burned with the avenging fires of God Al-
</p>
<p>mighty.
</p>
<p>Let us now approach and take a more particular view
</p>
<p>of the structure of the fabric.
</p>
<p>At the time of Nicholas I., A. D. 858-867, we discover
</p>
<p>the model of this new building prepared and the materials
</p>
<p>for it wrought out. Moreover the first efforts to erect

</p>
<p>it were made by him.
</p>
<p>260 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>It is true that this exercise of power and claim of
</p>
<p>prerogatives was followed by a period of great Papal
</p>
<p>weakness and corruption one of the most disgrace-
</p>
<p>ful in the history of the Papacy. The power of the
</p>
<p>vigorous German emperors was needed and was inter-
</p>
<p>posed to correct most scandalous abuses and immoralities
</p>
<p>and to regulate the head of the church ; and for a time
</p>
<p>the imperial power was greatly in the ascendant. Still,
</p>
<p>however, the principles and claims advanced by Nicholas,
</p>
<p>after the uniform policy of the popes, were never with-
</p>
<p>drawn. They were precedents, to be used as soon as cir-
</p>
<p>cumstances favored. They were seed sown, to come up
</p>
<p>and bear fruit at the destined time. Accordingly under
</p>
<p>Gregory VII. they came up in full vigor. Accordingly,
</p>
<p>if we pass on and survey the time from Gregory VII. to
</p>
<p>Innocent III., we find the building up and completed
</p>
<p>even as it was at the reformation and as it stands at
</p>
<p>this day.
</p>
<p>And now is it asked, "Who planned this building ? I
</p>
<p>answer, The Romish hierarchy, just as truly as they
</p>
<p>planned St. Peter's Church in the interval from Julius I.
</p>
<p>to Leo X. What is its great idea ? A corporation of
</p>
<p>bishops centralized around the pope, and bound to him
</p>
<p>by feudal oaths in accordance with the ideas of feudal
</p>
<p>times. The pope is the great feudal monarch of the
</p>
<p>church, and also an independent temporal ruler. He also
</p>
<p>claims to be the feudal lord of kings and emperors. Who
</p>
<p>erected this building ? I answer, The pope, the bishops,
</p>
<p>and their workmen. On what is it founded ? and what
</p>
<p>are its materials? On forgeries entirely; and these are
</p>
<p>its materials in all its parts. Of these forgeries, what are
</p>
<p>the chief? The forged decretals of Isidore and the dona-
</p>
<p>tion of Constantine. Such is an outline of the course of

</p>
<p>events which resulted in the present Romish corporation.
</p>
<p>FORMATION OF THE ROMISH CORPORATION. 261
</p>
<p>If we examine carefully the whole of this extended
</p>
<p>scheme, we shall find that its execution presupposed and
</p>
<p>demanded the four following great steps :
</p>
<p>1. By a false idea of holiness, and a false sacramental
</p>
<p>system, to put the people into the hands of the clergy for
</p>
<p>salvation.
</p>
<p>2. To establish the principles early developed, of mo-
</p>
<p>narchical power in the bishops of the churches in numer-
</p>
<p>ous small spheres, by an early and primitive set of forge-
</p>
<p>ries in the name of all the apostles, and thus to hew out the
</p>
<p>component parts of the last great fabric by themselves,
</p>
<p>but not to raise the building or put together its parts.
</p>
<p>3. After these parts had been once centralized around
</p>
<p>different and coordinate centres in the Roman empire, to
</p>
<p>devise the plan for a new organization of them around a
</p>
<p>common centre in the feudal ages that should follow the
</p>
<p>downfall of Rome. To effect this, it was necessary to
</p>
<p>provide a model for the new building, and also the scaf-
</p>
<p>folding, coupling irons, girders, braces, pins, and bolts
</p>
<p>that were necessary to put the parts together and fix
</p>
<p>them in their places.
</p>
<p>The last step obviously was,
</p>
<p>4. To raise the building, put it together, cover and
</p>
<p>paint it, and finish it inside and out.
</p>
<p>The first step of this process was accomplished in the
</p>
<p>early ages of the church. Even in the days of Paul the
</p>
<p>principles were at work.
</p>
<p>The second part was completed by the forgery of the
</p>
<p>Apostolical Constitutions, designed to establish by divine
</p>
<p>authority the augmented power, dignity, and honor of
</p>
<p>the bishops, but not to centralize them around the Pope of
</p>
<p>Rome. Thus the elementary parts of the great fabric
</p>
<p>were prepared ; but they were not so combined as to make

</p>
<p>a universal despotism.
</p>
<p>262 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>The third part of the process was accomplished by first
</p>
<p>organizing these parts into coordinate hierarchies under
</p>
<p>the Roman government, and by then preparing the means
</p>
<p>for the consolidation of them into one by the forged de-
</p>
<p>cretals in the feudal times after old Rome fell, and to give
</p>
<p>this a basis on a temporal monarchy by the forged dona-
</p>
<p>tion of Constantine and other similar forgeries.
</p>
<p>The fourth part of the process was effected by such men
</p>
<p>as Nicholas I., Gregory VII., Innocent III., who labored
</p>
<p>assiduously from century to century till the fabric was
</p>
<p>completed.
</p>
<p>From this brief survey, it is evident that the period from
</p>
<p>Gregory VII. to the reformation, a period of four centuries,
</p>
<p>is eminently THE PAPAL PERIOD. Parts of the system were
</p>
<p>developed in early ages ; but such a combination of them
</p>
<p>as distinguished this period, and the various inventions de-
</p>
<p>signed and essential to carry out and perfect the system,
</p>
<p>were not even dreamed of in the early ages. It is no less
</p>
<p>evident that fraud and forgery are the basis of the whole
</p>
<p>system, and that, to go to the bottom of the whole matter,
</p>
<p>we ought to take a radical view of the origin and nature
</p>
<p>of the pious frauds of the early ages and the forged
</p>
<p>literature of the middle ages. This I propose in its place
</p>
<p>to do ; but at present I can only give a brief account of
</p>
<p>the greatest of all forgeries ever known on earth, and on
</p>
<p>which, more than on all else, the present Romish corpora-
</p>
<p>tion is based.
</p>
<p>It appears that the principles needed were such as were
</p>
<p>suited to centralize the bishops around the pope, to give
</p>
<p>him supreme legislative and judicial power, and to make
</p>
<p>him an independent temporal monarch.
</p>
<p>But whence can they be derived ? From the Bible ? It
</p>
<p>is not pretended. From the authentic works of the fathers ?

</p>
<p>No ; they are not there. From previous forgeries ? No ;
</p>
<p>FORMATION OF THE ROMISH CORPORATION. 263
</p>
<p>these have had their day ; they are not sufficient. From de-
</p>
<p>cisions of general councils ? No ; these are all against the
</p>
<p>plan. How then? They must be forged newly, wholly
</p>
<p>forged.
</p>
<p>But in whose name ? The decretals are to be forged in
</p>
<p>the name of Clement, spoken of by Paul, and of those
</p>
<p>claimed as his successors in the early centuries in the chair
</p>
<p>of Peter, as the Pope of Rome. They are to be decrees
</p>
<p>issued by them to the churches, and they are to contain
</p>
<p>just what the popes or Satan needed at that time to carry
</p>
<p>out their plans of a centralized monarchy. The points at
</p>
<p>which they aim are,
</p>
<p>1. To make plain the establishment of Peter's see at
</p>
<p>Rome, and the transmission of his power to the popes, and
</p>
<p>what that power was.
</p>
<p>2. To establish, and defend, and increase the power of
</p>
<p>the bishops against the laity, and to shield them from all
</p>
<p>attacks.
</p>
<p>3. Above all, to make the pope the great centre of the
</p>
<p>whole system investing him with a plenitude of power,
</p>
<p>legislative and judicial.
</p>
<p>4. To give him independence of all temporal powers
</p>
<p>by the use of an earlier forgery in the name of Constantino.
</p>
<p>Accordingly the forgeries were made ; and in the names
</p>
<p>of those men and a forged council under Sylvester all
</p>
<p>these things were done, and the decretals were put forth
</p>
<p>as the decisions of God through the early popes, to be re-
</p>
<p>ceived and obeyed on penalty of eternal damnation.
</p>
<p>And now, perhaps, you will call for my proof of all this.
</p>
<p>It is found in the first volume of an 'edition of the councils.
</p>
<p>Here are the forged decretals themselves ; here is the do-
</p>
<p>nation of Constantino ; here is the forged council of
</p>
<p>which I spoke ; and they contain all that I have alleged.

<p>But whose edition is it ? Is it authentic ? or is it a
</p>
<p>264 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>Protestant edition ? It is the first volume of Councils, by
</p>
<p>Severinus Binius, published at Cologne 1618, authenti-
</p>
<p>cated by a special bull of Pope Paul V., sanctioned and
</p>
<p>patronized by the Emperor of Germany, doubly approved
</p>
<p>and licensed by the Romish censors of the press.
</p>
<p>Its titlepage exhibits its character. On the top the three
</p>
<p>Persons of the Trinity are represented ; on one side of
</p>
<p>them is Peter, with his keys and coat of arms ; on the
</p>
<p>other, a representation of the temporal power wielded by
</p>
<p>the pope through the sword. On the right side the church,
</p>
<p>holding a cross, the pope's triple crown, and keys ; on the
</p>
<p>left side religion, with a crucifix ; and over each the Holy
</p>
<p>Ghost as a dove. At the bottom, the pope, at the head of
</p>
<p>the corporation of bishops, treading on a prostrate band
</p>
<p>of so called heretics ; and over them, in Latin, the inscrip-
</p>
<p>tion : " They are dead that sought the church's life."
</p>
<p>No one need doubt that this is a genuine Roman Cath-
</p>
<p>olic book. Besides, Binius, in his address to the magis-
</p>
<p>trates of Cologne, speaks of its contents as the basis of
</p>
<p>the Roman canon law, and calls on the pope to defend it
</p>
<p>against the assaults of innovators and heretics ; and the
</p>
<p>pope responds to his appeal, sanctions it by a bull, and
</p>
<p>says the book has given him great consolation, and that
</p>
<p>he believes that the audacity and the petulance of the ad-
</p>
<p>versaries of truth will be powerfully crushed by it, and
</p>
<p>their impostures and lies against the sound and orthodox
</p>
<p>doctrine of the holy fathers will be admirably detected.
</p>
<p>Let us now read and see. The heretics say that there
</p>
<p>is no proof that Peter ever was at Rome or had his see
</p>
<p>there, or a chair or llhrone there, or that he transmitted
</p>
<p>his authority, and no proof that he had any to transmit.
</p>
<p>Now, see how very easy it is for this book to crush tbre
</p>
<p>audacity and petulance of such adversaries of the truth.

</p>
<p>to James the apostle at Jerusalem, establishing beyond
</p>
<p>dispute the genuine Romish doctrine on all these points.
</p>
<p>This great gap in history is thus completely filled.
</p>
<p>Clement opens the letter by pronouncing a eulogy on
</p>
<p>Peter, as an introduction to a statement of the mournful
</p>
<p>fact of his death. He then proceeds to say, " When he
</p>
<p>saw that his death was near, having assembled the breth-
</p>
<p>ren, he suddenly arose, and, taking me by the hand, spoke
</p>
<p>these words in the hearing of the whole church : ' Hear
</p>
<p>me, my brethren and fellow-servants. Inasmuch as the day
</p>
<p>of my death is at hand, even as I have been told by my
</p>
<p>Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, who sent me, I ordain this
</p>
<p>Clement as your bishop, and to him alone I assign the
</p>
<p>chair of my preaching and doctrine. He has been with
</p>
<p>me in all things from the beginning as an attendant, and
</p>
<p>thus has thoroughly known the truths which I preach.
</p>
<p>In all my trials he has been my constant and faithful com-
</p>
<p>panion. I have found him to be eminently distinguished
</p>
<p>for his love to God and to man, chaste, devoted to study,
</p>
<p>sober, kind, just, patient, and able to bear injuries even
</p>
<p>from those who profess to be students of the word of
</p>
<p>God. Therefore I give, him the power of binding and
</p>
<p>loosing which was given to me by my Lord ; so that what-
</p>
<p>soever he shall decree on earth shall be decreed in heav-
</p>
<p>en. He shall bind what ought to be bound and loose what
</p>
<p>ought to be loosed, as one who perfectly understands the
</p>
<p>laws of the church. Hear ye him, therefore, knowing
</p>
<p>that whosoever shall grieve a teacher of the truth sins
</p>
<p>against Christ, and offends God, the Father of all, and
</p>
<p>shall therefore perish. But he who rules others ought to
</p>
<p>act the part of a physician, and not to be actuated by the
</p>
<p>fury of a wild beast.' ;; He then proceeds to state his
</p>
<p>own modest reluctance to assume so great a burden, and
</p>
<p>the urgency and decision of Peter in refusing to allow

</p>
<p>him to decline the office. After this he records at length
</p>
<p>the charge of Peter to him, to the other officers of the
</p>
<p>church, and to the brethren, extending through six large
</p>
<p>folio pages. At the close he demands belief and obedi-
</p>
<p>ence of all, on penalty of the wrath of God and endless
</p>
<p>Buffering in penal fire.
</p>
<p>Thus we have an account of this important transaction
</p>
<p>in detail, to the confusion of all heretics and to the honor
</p>
<p>and comfort of all genuine Romanists. In the same way
</p>
<p>these decretals set forth the power of the bishops. Of
</p>
<p>course they fully unfold the magnitude of the pope's pow-
</p>
<p>er, and set forth the doctrine that he is the summit of
</p>
<p>judgment in ecclesiastical cases, and that all who think
</p>
<p>themselves injured may and ought to appeal to him.
</p>
<p>Thus Anacletus, the third pope, after setting forth the
</p>
<p>regular order of appeals to metropolitans and patriarchs,
</p>
<p>expressly says, " If difficult questions arise, let them, on
</p>
<p>appeal, be referred to the apostolic seat ; for the apostles
</p>
<p>decided this by the command of the Savior, that the great
</p>
<p>and more difficult questions shall always be referred to
</p>
<p>the apostolic chair, upon which Christ built the whole
</p>
<p>church when he said to the blessed Peter, the prince of
</p>
<p>the apostles, ' Thou art a rock, 7 " &c.
</p>
<p>Sixtus, the seventh pope, says, " If any one has been
</p>
<p>overthrown in judgment by any calamity, let him not hes-
</p>
<p>itate to appeal to this sacred and apostolic seat ; but let
</p>
<p>him take refuge in it as the head of the church, lest he
</p>
<p>should be condemned without cause or his church suffer
</p>
<p>wrong."
</p>
<p>Here, now, we have the highest authority ; for Anacle-
</p>
<p>tus, as appears from the Papal lists, was pope before Clem-
</p>
<p>ent, even in .the very times of the apostles, and Sixtus ia
</p>
<p>only the thirji after Clement. What more, then, could

</p>
<p>the most incredulous wish ? Moreover, as the pope need-
</p>
<p>FORMATION OF THE ROMISH CORPORATION. 267
</p>
<p>ed to be independent of all civil law and jurisdiction,
</p>
<p>here is the donation of Constantine, the original basis of
</p>
<p>his claims to temporal power.
</p>
<p>In this, Constantine, after referring to his baptism by
</p>
<p>Sylvester, gives to him and his see all glory, all dignity,
</p>
<p>all imperial power ; also the palace of the Lateran, all
</p>
<p>imperial vestments, and the imperial dignity. He then
</p>
<p>adds, " That the Papal supremacy may not be degraded,
</p>
<p>but may excel in honor and power all earthly authority,
</p>
<p>we give and grant, not only our palace as before said, but
</p>
<p>the city Rome, and all the provinces, places, and cities
</p>
<p>of Italy and of the "Western regions, to the aforesaid
</p>
<p>blessed Pope Sylvester, universal bishop, and to his suc-
</p>
<p>cessors in the Papal authority and power. * * * For
</p>
<p>this reason we have thought it fit to transfer our authority
</p>
<p>and power into the Oriental regions, and in the best loca-
</p>
<p>tion in the Byzantine province to build a city in our name
</p>
<p>and there to establish our empire ; since where the head
</p>
<p>of the priests and of the Christian religion, ordained by
</p>
<p>the King of heaven, bears sway, there it is not right that
</p>
<p>an earthly emperor should have any power."
</p>
<p>But, lest the pope should seem to rest his jurisdiction
</p>
<p>on the decision of the imperial power, the authority of a
</p>
<p>council is needed ; and therefore, to make assurance
</p>
<p>doubly sure, here is the Roman council, under Sylvester,
</p>
<p>giving religious and political supremacy of judgment to
</p>
<p>the pope.
</p>
<p>Of this the twentieth canon is as follows : " Let no one
</p>
<p>judge the chief bishop ; since all prelates desire that jus-
</p>
<p>tice should be dispensed by the chief bishop. Let not this
</p>
<p>judge be judged, neither by the emperor, nor by the whole
</p>
<p>clergy, nor by kings, nor by the people."
</p>
<p>Is not this enough to crush the petulance and audacity

</p>
<p>And then, think of the terrific sanction annexed to a
</p>
<p>disregard of the decretals the wrath of Almighty God
</p>
<p>and eternal fire on all who will not believe and obey !
</p>
<p>And now it may be asked, Were these things ever put
</p>
<p>forth to be believed ? I answer, Yes, and to be acted on ;
</p>
<p>and for eight long centuries they were believed and acted
</p>
<p>on. They furnished the very principles that the pope and
</p>
<p>his agents needed to put up the present structure of this
</p>
<p>corporation. They used them and put it up, and they be-
</p>
<p>came the very basis of the present Romish canon law.
</p>
<p>There was, as I have said, an earlier set of apostolic
</p>
<p>canons and constitutions forged and fitted to use for a
</p>
<p>time. But these, though useful in their day, did not contain
</p>
<p>the powers needed for the present exigency ; but, as they
</p>
<p>still had authority in some things, they and the Isidorian
</p>
<p>canons were wrought together by Gratian and an effort
</p>
<p>made to reconcile the contradictions. (Concordantia Dis-
</p>
<p>cordantium Canonum, 1. iii. 1151.) At last all of the old
</p>
<p>canon law that was inconsistent with the new was dropped,
</p>
<p>and the Isidorian principles in Gratian prevailed, and are
</p>
<p>now the very lifeblood of the Romish canon law, only it
</p>
<p>has been pushed to still greater extremes. And now, when
</p>
<p>I repeat that these are all forgeries, unmingled forgeries,
</p>
<p>without even a particle of truth to build on, I leave you
</p>
<p>to judge by what name such a deed should be called.
</p>
<p>Not a superficial forgery, but a forgery of a real terrific
</p>
<p>government, to the exclusion of the Bible a fundamental
</p>
<p>forgery of the very system which they now attempt to im-
</p>
<p>pose on us, as ordained of God and essential to salvation.
</p>
<p>But it may be asked, Is there clear proof that all these-
</p>
<p>things are forgeries ? I answer, There is proof so clear
</p>
<p>that even the ablest writers of the Romish church do not
</p>
<p>pretend to deny it.

<p>To be sure, this infallible corporation has never made an

</p>
<p>honorable confession ; nor have they yielded to the truth
</p>
<p>from the love of it, but because they were forced to do it
</p>
<p>by evidence so strong that they knew that it would be ruin-
</p>
<p>ous to their cause to make issue on this point. First Lyra
</p>
<p>and Calvin, and then the Magdeburg centuriators, assailed
</p>
<p>them ; and if any one desires to see a perfect logical, criti-
</p>
<p>cal, and historical annihilation of their claims, let him read
</p>
<p>the analysis of them in the second and third centuries of
</p>
<p>the Magdeburg centuriators and in Calvin. Their works
</p>
<p>are in the Boston Athenaeum and in the Harvard Library.
</p>
<p>Yet still Turrianus, a Jesuit, wrote five books in their de-
</p>
<p>fence ; and this book of Binius joins with Turrianus to
</p>
<p>defend them. The work of David Blondell, at Geneva,
</p>
<p>in 1628, ten years after this, settled the question. Baronius
</p>
<p>the cardinal, who wrote expressly to answer the Magde-
</p>
<p>burg centuriators, abandons the defence of them. Bellar-
</p>
<p>mine the Jesuit, a cardinal, and the great champion of the
</p>
<p>Romish cause, abandons the defence of them. Fleury, the
</p>
<p>great French historian, confessor to Louis XV., not only
</p>
<p>abandons the defence of them, but powerfully exposes their
</p>
<p>falsehood and pernicious consequences. I need not say
</p>
<p>that all Protestant historians do the same, and those who
</p>
<p>are neither Catholic nor Protestant do the same. Indeed
</p>
<p>these stupendous forgeries are as much an established and
</p>
<p>conceded fact in history as the English, American, and
</p>
<p>French revolutions.
</p>
<p>What, then, is the nature of the evidence that, against
</p>
<p>interests so prodigious and motives so violent, compelled
</p>
<p>the Romanists (not the popes, their decisions still stand) to
</p>
<p>abandon the defence of these foundations of their system?
</p>
<p>They were, in general, the utter absurdity on internal
</p>
<p>evidence of supposing them to have been written in the
</p>
<p>age in which they professed to have been written, and the
</p>
<p>absurdities and contradictions with which they are filled.

<p>270 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>The professed authors lived in ages of persecution and
</p>
<p>weakness and befcTre the hierarchy was developed. They
</p>
<p>omit all that is proper to that age. Their writings are not
</p>
<p>adapted to console or strengthen those suffering, persecuted
</p>
<p>Christians to whom they write. Nay, they are intent on
</p>
<p>nothing but the great work of regulating a hierarchy that
</p>
<p>did not exist, increasing the power of the pope and his
</p>
<p>patriarchs and bishops and organizing them into a compact
</p>
<p>system of despotism. They profess to be the letters of
</p>
<p>successive popes during the first two centuries. They are
</p>
<p>all in the style of one man. They profess to have been
</p>
<p>written long before the peculiar Latin words and style of
</p>
<p>the middle ages were formed or known ; yet they are full
</p>
<p>of such words, and all in the style of those ages. It is as
</p>
<p>if, in a professed letter of Lord Bacon, we should find
</p>
<p>him talking of daguerreotypes, and steamboats, and rail-
</p>
<p>roads in the style and idiom of this day. They profess
</p>
<p>to have been written long before certain writers lived and
</p>
<p>certain laws were made ; and yet they freely quote
</p>
<p>those writers and those laws. This is as if a professed
</p>
<p>letter of Franklin should quote the laws of this state
</p>
<p>passed this year or the last proclamation of Governor
</p>
<p>Briggs. They profess to have been written when in fact
</p>
<p>certain doctrines and rites were unknown ; and yet they
</p>
<p>are full of those doctrines and rites. They profess to have
</p>
<p>been written before the occurrence of certain controver-
</p>
<p>sies respecting some of the very points decided by them ;
</p>
<p>and yet, though their authority would have been decisive,
</p>
<p>no one in those controversies ever appealed to them.
</p>
<p>Again : they profess to be written by men who must at
</p>
<p>least have known enough to date their own letters cor-
</p>
<p>rectly ; yet they are full of false dates ; so that, according
</p>
<p>to the dates, some were written before the authors were

<p>popes, and others after they were dead.
</p>
<p>FORMATION OF THE ROMISH CORPORATION. 271
</p>
<p>But the most notorious blunder of all is in trying to
</p>
<p>link the pontifical chain to Peter at Rome. Great pains
</p>
<p>is taken to do this thoroughly ; and yet, in his efforts to
</p>
<p>make assurance doubly sure, the forger makes Clement
</p>
<p>tell us that Peter, before his death, enjoined it on him to
</p>
<p>write to James, brother of our Lord, at Jerusalem, and
</p>
<p>inform him of all the facts. And yet it is a notorious
</p>
<p>fact that James died seven years before Peter ; and yet
</p>
<p>Peter, it seems, did not know of this fact, but supposed him
</p>
<p>still living at Jerusalem. He must have been a poor
</p>
<p>pope indeed. Our popes commonly find it out before
</p>
<p>seven years when a bishop dies. But Peter, it seems, did
</p>
<p>not yet know, when he ordained Clement Pope of Rome,
</p>
<p>that James, one of his brother apostles, was dead, though
</p>
<p>he had been dead seven years.
</p>
<p>The force of this is so great that it staggered Binius.
</p>
<p>He says, either this epistle was not written by Clement, or
</p>
<p>else the name James crept into the title instead of Simeon ;
</p>
<p>which last he seems to rest on. A miserable subterfuge
</p>
<p>truly. Not only is the name James in the title, but in
</p>
<p>the body of the letter ; and not in one letter, but in two.
</p>
<p>Truly this is a splendid way, as the pope says, to crush
</p>
<p>the audacity and the petulance of the heretics.
</p>
<p>1. And now, who is responsible for all this? It may
</p>
<p>be said, not the popes and bishops, but Isidore and other
</p>
<p>forgers. Is it so ? I ask, Whose ends did these forgeries
</p>
<p>promote? whose power were they designed to increase?
</p>
<p>"Was it not that of the bishops and popes ? Again : Who
</p>
<p>used them ? Did not the bishops and popes ? Again :
</p>
<p>Who sanctioned them ? Did not the successive popes ?
</p>
<p>and did not the bishops consent? This, as Peter Dens
</p>
<p>tells us, binds the whole church. Again : Who gave these
</p>
<p>decretals such authority in the new canon law of Rome ?

<p>And have these things ever been retracted or undone ?
</p>
<p>2t2 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>2. What - defence is made? Are the facts denied?
</p>
<p>They cannot be. The defence is, that the pope and bish-
</p>
<p>ops did not gain AS MUCH by them as is alleged. Then
</p>
<p>the guilt of a forgery is to be estimated by the amount
</p>
<p>gained : and, so far as you diminish the amount, you dimin-
</p>
<p>ish the guilt. Is this Romish morality ? So it seems.
</p>
<p>But one thing is sure it is not the morality of God. He
</p>
<p>that is unfaithful in little is unfaithful in much. But is it
</p>
<p>little for such a system to have had undisputed power for
</p>
<p>eight hundred years, with an authority greater than that
</p>
<p>of the Bible ? Let the candid judge.
</p>
<p>3. Was no protest made in that long age ? There was ;
</p>
<p>but Papal power, and the terrors of excommunication,
</p>
<p>and the stake silenced it.
</p>
<p>4. This point, then, renders my argument complete.
</p>
<p>Even if an infallible corporation was promised, this is not
</p>
<p>the one. Mr. Brownson's a posteriori scriptural argument
</p>
<p>only professes to reach this point that Christ promised to
</p>
<p>establish an infallible corporation. His a priori argument
</p>
<p>only professes to prove that one is essential to faith.
</p>
<p>Neither argument is valid. But if they were, I still say,
</p>
<p>a forging and swindling corporation is not God's inter-
</p>
<p>preter or guide to heaven, but the object of his fiercest
</p>
<p>wrath.
</p>
<p>5. I have selected this as a case clear and momentous
</p>
<p>and of which the proof is undeniable ; but it stands not
</p>
<p>by itself. It is the part of a widely-extended system, as
</p>
<p>I shall show in its place. Satan did indeed come through
</p>
<p>this corporation with power, and signs, and lying won-
</p>
<p>ders, and all deceivableness of unrighteousness. They
</p>
<p>spoke lies in hypocrisy, having their consciences seared
</p>
<p>as with a hot iron.
</p>
<p>6. And now, can a corporation of which such are the

</p>
<p>louder than words ? I hesitate not to say that the Romish
</p>
<p>corporation, by these and similar forgeries and frauds,
</p>
<p>founded her whole system on notorious falsehoods. What
</p>
<p>wonder, then, that, as I have shown, she became the great
</p>
<p>school of lying for the whole world ? Nor can a moral
</p>
<p>soundness on earth as to the truth be produced except
</p>
<p>by the formation of a sentiment of righteous abhorrence
</p>
<p>that shall consume her as burning fire. She is .simply - a
</p>
<p>political, religious, and commercial confederation, or cor-
</p>
<p>poration, banded against God and the truth ; and either
</p>
<p>God and the truth must give way, or she must be de-
</p>
<p>stroyed. Which do you think will be the result?
</p>
<p>7. Finally, to do this work God asks no brutal force,
</p>
<p>no persecution, no material fire. He needs only that
</p>
<p>brute force shall not be allowed to murder those who
</p>
<p>speak the truth ; and then he will kindle no fire but the
</p>
<p>fire of holiness and truth. But none does he need besides.
</p>
<p>This will consume the wb.de system to ashes and burn it

<p>CHAPTER IT.
</p>
<p>NICHOLAS I. AND THE FORGERIES AND FRAUDS OF THE
</p>
<p>MIDDLE AGES.
</p>
<p>WE are prone to be incredulous when we see a phe-
</p>
<p>nomenon far beyond the range of our experience. We, as
</p>
<p>Protestants, have never sounded the depths of the sys-
</p>
<p>tem of pious frauds. We need, then, to pause and to look
</p>
<p>more deeply into the matter. No one can easily conceive
</p>
<p>how deeply it has affected the destinies of Europe and of
</p>
<p>the world.
</p>
<p>We propose, then, to aim at two points at once to
</p>
<p>sketch the character of the pope who first appealed to
</p>
<p>the forged decretals, that we may have a specimen of
</p>
<p>their use ; and then to give a view of the principles from
</p>
<p>which they originated, and a more full description of the
</p>
<p>decretals themselves and of their influence on the world,
</p>
<p>as well as of the influence of the theory of pious fraud on
</p>
<p>which they are based. It will be seen that this was the
</p>

<p>In speaking of the forgeries of the middle ages, we

<p>take the Papacy of Nicholas I. as the point of vision

<p>A. D. 858-867 ; in the first place because he first ap-

<p>and then because he is a fine exemplification of that spir-
</p>
<p>it of matchless impudence with which the leaders of the
</p>
<p>corporation of Rome have imposed their forgeries and
</p>
<p>frauds on the world in all ages.
</p>
<p>After Leo the Great, A. D. 440-461, and Gregory the
</p>
<p>Great, A. D. 590-604, and before Gregory VII., A. D.
</p>
<p>1073-1085, this same Nicholas is, beyond all doubt,
</p>
<p>the most remarkable of the pontiffs. And although his
</p>
<p>name has not the same bad eminence in the popular mind
</p>
<p>with that of the notorious Hildebrand, yet so great was
</p>
<p>the influence exerted by him on the course of events that
</p>
<p>Guizot does not hesitate to assert that the sovereignty of
</p>
<p>the pope really takes date from his reign.
</p>
<p>When he ascended the throne, the Popes of Rome, in
</p>
<p>their progress towards supremacy, were exposed to the
</p>
<p>resistance of four powers the patriarch of Constanti-
</p>
<p>nople, their most dangerous spiritual rival and antago-
</p>
<p>nist ; the national churches of Europe, which had arisen
</p>
<p>since the invasion of the barbarians, especially those of
</p>
<p>Italy, France, Spain, and England ; the metropolitans, an
</p>
<p>ecclesiastical nobility who ruled the bishops of particular
</p>
<p>provinces ; and the civil power, whether imperial or royal.
</p>
<p>Three of these powers were represented by two men
</p>
<p>quite as remarkable as Nicholas himself. The chair of
</p>
<p>the see of Constantinople was filled by Photius a man of
</p>
<p>vast native powers, of unrivalled scholarship and learn-
</p>
<p>ing, of exhaustless energy and infinite ambition. Before
</p>
<p>he was raised to the patriarchal throne he had passed
</p>
<p>through almost all grades of civil office and promotion.
</p>
<p>Without entering into the details of the warfare, it is
</p>
<p>enough to say that these ambitious rulers of the Eastern
</p>
<p>and Western churches met in fierce encounter. Nicholas
</p>
<p>excommunicated Photius, and Photius Nicholas ; and the

</p>
<p>great and incurable Greek schism was the ultimate result.
</p>
<p>276 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>The national churches were represented in the person
</p>
<p>of the celebrated Hincmar, Archbishop of Rheims and
</p>
<p>Primate of France, the great churchman of the age. and
</p>
<p>the most learned canonist of the church.
</p>
<p>In his relations to his own bishops he also represented
</p>
<p>the ecclesiastical nobility, whom the pope needed to sub-
</p>
<p>due, in order to centralize all the bishops directly in
</p>
<p>himself.
</p>
<p>By the canons of the council of Sardica, A. D. 34T,
</p>
<p>(which yet was not ecumenical,) the Papal power was
</p>
<p>extended, as we have said, beyond all precedent, and con-
</p>
<p>trary to all right, in merely allowing appeals at all from
</p>
<p>metropolitan councils to the Roman pontiff, and for cen-
</p>
<p>turies after this council the African bishops forbade such
</p>
<p>appeals. And yet, even by these canons, the pope could
</p>
<p>only order a new trial in the province, aided by his
</p>
<p>legates, and, if need be, by delegates from neighboring
</p>
<p>provinces. (Bower, i. 57, 58.) Nor did the East or Af-
</p>
<p>rica ever receive this council ; nor did the council of
</p>
<p>Chalcedon sanction its decrees.
</p>
<p>This council, then, did not furnish the materials needed
</p>
<p>to establish and consolidate the Papal power. Such
</p>
<p>materials, in fact, did not -exist. It was necessary to
</p>
<p>forge them, and thus to set up claims which should give
</p>
<p>to the pope the right of removing all such cases to Rome,
</p>
<p>to be tried before his own tribunal. And this point, too,
</p>
<p>was to be carried, and was carried, against such a man as
</p>
<p>Hincmar of Rheims.
</p>
<p>The regal power was also to be subdued, and was sub-
</p>
<p>dued, in the person of the feeble Lotharius. Had the
</p>
<p>regal authority been represented by a sovereign like
</p>
<p>Charlemagne, swaying with strong grasp the power of a
</p>
<p>united empire, the aggressions of Nicholas would have met
</p>
<p>with less success had he dared to engage in a warfare so

</p>
<p>But the vast dominions of Charlemagne had been divid-
</p>
<p>ed among his feeble descendants, and they had turned their
</p>
<p>arms against each other. Two grandsons and three great-
</p>
<p>grandsons of Charlemagne then sat on feeble thrones.
</p>
<p>The grandsons were Louis in Germany and Charles the
</p>
<p>Bald in France; the great-grandsons, Louis in Italy and
</p>
<p>Rhoetia, Lotharius .in Burgundy, Alsatia, and Lorraine,
</p>
<p>and Charles in Provence. The rest of these could in a
</p>
<p>moment be stirred up to invade the dominions of any of
</p>
<p>the five whom the pope should excommunicate. Hence
</p>
<p>each was powerless in single combat with the pope. A
</p>
<p>single Papal anathema would become the signal for the
</p>
<p>invasion and subjugation of his territories by the others.
</p>
<p>Of course Nicholas felt that he was their master, and
</p>
<p>declared himself such. He singled out Lotharius as the
</p>
<p>object of an attack designed to demonstrate and estab-
</p>
<p>lish his power. Lotharius having married one wife,
</p>
<p>Theutberga, desired, like Henry VIII. in after days, to
</p>
<p>divorce her, and to take another, Waldrada. So in fact
</p>
<p>he did, and that with the countenance of his own bishops,
</p>
<p>led on by the Archbishops Gunthier and Teutgaud, a
</p>
<p>brother and uncle of "Waldrada. Notice, now, the influ-
</p>
<p>ence of weakness in a king on the conscience of a pope.
</p>
<p>Charlemagne twice did the same thing. He also left
</p>
<p>illegitimate children behind him, as the fruit of his licen-
</p>
<p>tious excesses. But he was strong ; therefore the Papal
</p>
<p>conscience was undisturbed, and he was sainted. But
</p>
<p>Lotharius, his luckless- descendant, was weak. This
</p>
<p>aroused the tender conscience of the pope ; and with
</p>
<p>apostolic zeal he declared war upon him for his manifest
</p>
<p>crime.
</p>
<p>Even so the conscience of Gregory VII. was very
</p>
<p>sensitive in the case of Henry ' IV., who was enfee-
</p>
<p>bled by a revolt in his empire, but was quite tor-

</p>
<p>pid in the case of "William the Conqueror, for he was un-
</p>
<p>conquerably strong. Yet William had sinned as griev-
</p>
<p>ously as Henry. At- the synod of Winchester, A. D.
</p>
<p>1076, Gregory's law, enjoining the celibacy of the clergy,
</p>
<p>was very materially modified. The bishops whom Greg-
</p>
<p>ory had summoned to Rome were forbidden by William
</p>
<p>to obey the summons, to the very great annoyance and
</p>
<p>chagrin of Gregory. The king, too, continued to exer-
</p>
<p>cise the right of investiture, which in the case of Henry
</p>
<p>was so impious. Other presumptuous demands of Greg-
</p>
<p>ory were repelled with cold indifference. Yet no thun-
</p>
<p>derbolts of divine wrath were hurled from the pontifical
</p>
<p>throne against the royal sinner. Gregory prudently
</p>
<p>declined the encounter with so vigorous an antagonist,
</p>
<p>fearful of provoking him to terrific retaliation. Hence
</p>
<p>the spirit of the Papal policy in all ages is truly described
</p>
<p>in the old saying, in which we are told that the chief
</p>
<p>end of man is to keep what he has got and to get what
</p>
<p>he can. The aggrandizement of their power has been
</p>
<p>their constant end in all ages. In pursuit of this, they
</p>
<p>have, as circumstances favored, steadily augmented their
</p>
<p>claims, regarding merely the principles of selfish policy,
</p>
<p>and never those of benevolence, honor, or truth.
</p>
<p>So Nicholas acted in the case of Lotharius. Theut-
</p>
<p>berga solicited his aid. He undertook her cause, and,
</p>
<p>under pretext of defending her, put forth and established
</p>
<p>the most arrogant claims of Papal supremacy. He encoun-
</p>
<p>tered and defeated both king, archbishops, and bishops.
</p>
<p>Though the council of bishops at Aix-la-Chapelle, in
</p>
<p>accordance with the wishes of the king, had divorced her,
</p>
<p>this was nothing to Nicholas. He sent legates into Lor-
</p>
<p>raine, and, at a second council at Metz, caused the case
</p>
<p>to be reexamined by his legates. Lotharius bribed the

</p>
<p>the first. Nicholas was enraged, but not dismayed. By
</p>
<p>an extravagant assumption of power, by his own authority,
</p>
<p>he declared the decision null and void, and deposed at a
</p>
<p>blow the king's archbishops, Gunthier and Teutgaud, and
</p>
<p>he was victorious. Though they struggled long and des-
</p>
<p>perately against him, they could not retain their office,
</p>
<p>but fell before his power. He also excommunicated
</p>
<p>Waldrada, and compelled Lotharius to take back Theut-
</p>
<p>berga. Thus did he effectually subdue the regal power.
</p>
<p>Twice also, in an ecclesiastical conflict, he defeated
</p>
<p>Hincmar ; and here he invested himself in the panoply of
</p>
<p>the forged decretals. Of these we may safely say that,
</p>
<p>of all the forgeries that ever disgraced the nominal fol-
</p>
<p>lowers of Christianity, they are the most gigantic in con-
</p>
<p>ception, successful in execution, and terrific in power.
</p>
<p>They changed the whole face of the Christian world, and
</p>
<p>are the spirit of the canon law and the basis of the Papal
</p>
<p>corporation to this day.

<p>THE FORGED DECRETALS.

<p>Gieseler fixes their composition between A. D. 829 and

<p>845 in France, and ascribes them to Benedict Levita, of

<p>Mentz. Guizot coincides. As to the direct agency of
</p>
<p>the popes in their composition, opinions vary. But
</p>
<p>Mosheim does not hesitate to regard the popes as their
</p>
<p>knowing and deliberate authors. He regards it as im-
</p>
<p>possible that such a forgery should have come into exist-
</p>
<p>ence and use, touching as it does all the springs of their

<p>influence and authority, without their knowledge and

<p>cooperation. At all events, Nicholas I. has the unenvi-

</p>
<p>From him, till the reformation detected the cheat,
</p>
<p>that is, for about seven centuries, they were appealed
</p>
<p>to without suspicion in the public affairs of the church
</p>
<p>and used by the popes to gain their ends without any
</p>
<p>material opposition. That we do not falsely charge
</p>
<p>Nicholas, facts show. None of his predecessors have
</p>
<p>referred to them.
</p>
<p>Leo IV., A. D. 850, does not include them among the
</p>
<p>standards of judgment. Nor does even Nicholas L, in
</p>
<p>863 ; but in 865, in his letters to all the French bishops,
</p>
<p>he defends their authority. Gieseler, ii. 65-69.
</p>
<p>Nicholas was a fit leader in the enterprise of intro-
</p>
<p>ducing so vast a scheme of fraud for the purposes of
</p>
<p>hierarchical aggrandizement. He is an exact image of
</p>
<p>Gregory VII. or Innocent III. He was a man "of un
</p>
<p>common intellectual power, of great attainments for
</p>
<p>his age, and of gigantic energy of will. He 'was also
</p>
<p>ambitious to the highest degree, and strained his claims
</p>
<p>of supreme authority, infallibility, and irresponsibility to
</p>
<p>man to the highest pitch of extravagance and arrogance ;
</p>
<p>and having fought and gained a great battle with the
</p>
<p>civil power, in the person of King Lothaire II., on the
</p>
<p>points already specified, he also determined to gain a
</p>
<p>victory over the ecclesiastical nobility that came between
</p>
<p>the pope and the common order of bishops, and over
</p>
<p>national churches, in the person of Hincmar, Archbishop
</p>
<p>of Rheims, head of the French church. Hincmar had,
</p>
<p>without sufficient reason, suspended Rothade, Bishop of
</p>
<p>Soissons. He appealed to the pope. Hincmar disre-
</p>
<p>garded his appeal, and deposed him at the synod of
</p>
<p>Soissons. Rothade appealed again ; and Nicholas called
</p>
<p>up the affair at Rome, and by his own authority annulled
</p>
<p>the decision of the council and restored Rothade. Hinc-

<p>mar resisted, but was obliged to submit.
</p>
<p>THE FORGEKIES OP THE MIDDLE AGES. 281
</p>
<p>To defend himself in this highhanded measure, Nich-
</p>
<p>olas appealed to the authority of the forged decretals,
</p>
<p>thus introducing the use of that vast system of fraud ;
</p>
<p>for this is the first example, as before stated, of an
</p>
<p>appeal to this forgery.
</p>
<p>On this occasion, also, he asserted the pseudo-Isidorian
</p>
<p>principles in full that obedience was due to all Papal
</p>
<p>decrees as such, and demanded from all metropolitans, at
</p>
<p>their investiture with the pallium, an oath to this effect.
</p>
<p>Hincmar was the most learned canonist of the age : but so
</p>
<p>low was the general standard of scholarship and of criti-
</p>
<p>cism at that time that he could not expose the forgery.
</p>
<p>He did not deny the genuineness of the decretals as he
</p>
<p>ought, but resisted their authority. Nicholas, of course,
</p>
<p>prevailed.
</p>
<p>But we should misunderstand Nicholas and the men
</p>
<p>of that age if we supposed that they suddenly, and by
</p>
<p>one gigantic stride, so enormously overleaped the eternal
</p>
<p>barriers of truth, and, unaided and uninfluenced by pre-
</p>
<p>ceding generations, at once completed, like Satan and
</p>
<p>his workmen in hell, the vast fabric of falsehood, so that
</p>
<p>at once " the ascending pile stood fixed in stately height."
</p>
<p>Neither communities nor individuals become suddenly
</p>
<p>thus corrupt. The conscience of the church had been
</p>
<p>seared as with a hot iron, and she had spoken lies in
</p>
<p>hypocrisy, long before Nicholas. These portentous re-
</p>
<p>sults were but the mature fruit of seed early sown and
</p>
<p>plants assiduously cultivated -from almost the earliest
</p>
<p>ages of the church. One who comes fresh from the pure
</p>
<p>morality of the New Testament, consigning all liars to
</p>
<p>the lake of fire, finds it impossible to utter the feelings
</p>
<p>of shame and disappointment which agitate the mind
</p>
<p>when the history of the opinions and practices of the
</p>
<p>early ages on the subject of pious frauds is first unfolded.

<p>282 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>When, however, the power of these first emotions has
</p>
<p>somewhat subsided, and he attempts to take a philosoph-
</p>
<p>ical view of the facts, he finds in depraved human nature
</p>
<p>a deep foundation for such frauds, and soon discovers
</p>
<p>that a propensity to them is not limited to the Romish
</p>
<p>church, but that even in the Protestant world there is a
</p>
<p>constant temptation to fall into them. For a more full
</p>
<p>illustration of this dangerous tendency, we refer to an
</p>
<p>able essay of Archbishop Whately on Pious Frauds in
</p>
<p>his work entitled the Errors of Romanism traced to
</p>
<p>their Origin in Human Nature.
</p>
<p>"We shall, therefore, proceed to speak of the general
</p>
<p>nature of pious fraud ; the early introduction of it into
</p>
<p>the Christian church ; of its pernicious effects in the
</p>
<p>earlier ages upon the literature and history of the Chris-
</p>
<p>tian body ; its most perfect development in the forged
</p>
<p>decretals, in the frauds of Baronius, Bellarmine, and
</p>
<p>others ; the subsequent power and state of the system
</p>
<p>among the Romanists, and finally among the Puseyites.
</p>
<p>In a field so extensive, only a general sketch can be ex-
</p>
<p>pected in a brief essay.
</p>
<p>PIOUS FRAUDS.
</p>
<p>Pious frauds, as defined by Whately, are " those which
</p>
<p>any one employs and justifies to himself, as conducing,
</p>
<p>according to his view, to the defence or promotion of
</p>
<p>true religion." " There is in such conduct," he remarks,
</p>
<p>" a union of sincerity and insincerity of conscientious-
</p>
<p>ness in respect to the end, and unscrupulous dishonesty
</p>
<p>as to the means ; for without one of these there could be
</p>
<p>no fraud, and without the other it could in no sense be

</p>
<p>termed a pious fraud."
</p>
<p>THE FORGEEIES OF THE MIDDLE AGES. 283
</p>
<p>It is, therefore, only a specific case under the general
</p>
<p>diabolical maxim, that the end sanctifies the means a
</p>
<p>doctrine which God has emphatically condemned, by de-
</p>
<p>claring that the damnation is just of all who teach, Let
</p>
<p>us do evil that good may come.
</p>
<p>Yet is it not still an oft-disputed question among us,
</p>
<p>whether a lie is in any case justifiable? E.g.: Is it right
</p>
<p>to lie to a highwayman in order to save our money or our
</p>
<p>life? So, too, the question may be raised, "Was it not
</p>
<p>right for Rahab to save the spies by a lie, and for Jael
</p>
<p>to deceive Barak, the enemy of the Jews, in order to
</p>
<p>destroy him ? It may be asked, Did not Samuel deceive
</p>
<p>when he said, I am come to sacrifice to the Lord, when
</p>
<p>yet his real and main end was to anoint David as king ?
</p>
<p>Yet God directed him so to do.
</p>
<p>"We refer to these things to show that, if the early
</p>
<p>Christians were tempted to use pious frauds, there were
</p>
<p>materials enough of easy self-deception at hand. And if
</p>
<p>any one will look at the temptation in advocating a great
</p>
<p>and good cause, even at this day, to select and state only
</p>
<p>facts adapted to excite the public mind, and produce lib-
</p>
<p>erality, and to slur over unfavorable facts, he will see
</p>
<p>how easy it is to be led to overstate or falsely to color
</p>
<p>facts, or. to suppress what truly belongs to a full presen-
</p>
<p>tation of the subject considered.
</p>
<p>In addition to the case of temptation which we have
</p>
<p>stated, Whately supposes eight cases more, in which,
</p>
<p>even among .Protestants, there might be a temptation to
</p>
<p>employ pious fraud. And even these he specifies, not as
</p>
<p>exhausting the cases, but as illustrating the extent and
</p>
<p>power of the temptation. He refers also to the heathen
</p>
<p>legislators and philosophers who encouraged or connived
</p>
<p>at a system of mythology which they disbelieved, in

<p>populace in order. Their statesmen deluded and over-
</p>
<p>awed the populace with oracles and prodigies, just as the

<p>priests of the Romish and Greek churches have with
</p>
<p>false miracles and revelations. The present use of fraud
</p>
<p>and forgeries to gain important political ends or to save
</p>
<p>the country we need but advert to as of the same general
</p>
<p>kind. And many even now attempt to use similar influ-

<p>ences in governing children.
</p>
<p>Also he remarks, that when the process has once com-

<p>menced, and some falsehood has been wrought into a sys-

<p>tem regarded as in the main sound, there is a temptation
</p>
<p>to tolerate it, through fear of greater evil in destroying

<p>reverence for the whole system or of losing influence in
</p>
<p>assailing it. We thought it necessary to take this gen-
</p>
<p>eral view before coming to exhibit the development of
</p>
<p>these principles in the primitive church.
</p>
<p>The mass on whom Christianity operated had been al-
</p>
<p>ready degraded by such maxims and practices in the
</p>
<p>pagan world ; and they were not thoroughly and in a
</p>
<p>moment purged of their pollutions when they became
</p>
<p>Christians. Moreover a higher power of fraud prepared
</p>
<p>through them the way for results of which they little
</p>
<p>dreamed when they began their work of promoting truth
</p>
<p>by the use of fraud. Let us now consider the early in-
</p>
<p>troduction into the church of the system of pious frauds.
</p>
<p>Mosheim states (Cent. II., vol*. i. p. 130) that the Pla-
</p>
<p>tonists and Pythagoreans deemed it not only lawful, but
</p>
<p>commendable, to deceive and to lie for the sake of truth
</p>
<p>and piety. The Jews in Egypt learned from them this
</p>
<p>sentiment even before the days of Christ. From both
</p>
<p>this vice early spread among Christians. Books were
</p>
<p>forged under the names of eminent men ; also the Sibyl-

</p>
<p>line verses were fabricated by some Christian, in order
</p>
<p>THE FORGERIES OP THE MIDDLE AGES. 285
</p>
<p>to bring idolaters to "believe in Christianity. The pa-
</p>
<p>gans were indignant at this forgery, which they ascribed
</p>
<p>to Christians. (See Origen contra Celsum.) He also
</p>
<p>tells us (Cent. III., pp. 183, 184) that a similar mode of ar-
</p>
<p>gument was used by Origen and others. From such
</p>
<p>principles came the forged Apostolic Canons and Con-
</p>
<p>stitutions, the Recognitions of Clement, and the works
</p>
<p>of Dionysius the Areopagite in the fourth and fifth cen-
</p>
<p>turies. The system of pious frauds was adopted even
</p>
<p>by Ambrose, Hilary, Augustine, Gregory Nazianzen, Jer-
</p>
<p>ome, and Sulpitius Severus, in the Life of St. Martin.
</p>
<p>Thus was the way prepared by Satan for the deepest
</p>
<p>delusions of the middle ages.
</p>
<p>Gieseler (vol. i. p. 298) gives passages from Jerome and
</p>
<p>John Cassian in which the principles of the system are
</p>
<p>unfolded. The same fathers who thus wrote and prac-
</p>
<p>tised ascribed accommodation to Jesus and the apostles.
</p>
<p>Cassian argues its lawfulness from the case of Rahab and
</p>
<p>of Delilah. Though they used lies, they were aiming at
</p>
<p>great and good ends. Gieseler tells us, (vol. i. p. 298,)
</p>
<p>speaking of spurious writings up to A. D. 200, that their
</p>
<p>purpose was to encourage the persecuted, to convince the
</p>
<p>unbelieving, and to give the sanction of antiquity to cer-
</p>
<p>tain opinions.
</p>
<p>For such ends old spurious writings of the Jews were
</p>
<p>interpolated e. g., the Book of Enoch and the Fourth
</p>
<p>Book of Ezra. Others were forged e. g., the Testament
</p>
<p>of the Twelve Patriarchs, the Ascension of Isaiah, the
</p>
<p>Shepherd of Hermas, the Books of Hystaspes, the Acts
</p>
<p>of Pilate, the Sibylline Prophecies, <fec. All these are
</p>
<p>designed to promote millenarian views.

</p>
<p>Christianity, too, he tells ns, was then in the hands of
</p>
<p>Greeks and Africans, to whom our maxims of moralit
</p>
<p>were not known. " We shall never," says he, " do justic
</p>
<p>to the history of our religion unless we continually be
</p>
<p>in mind the low condition of society and morals existing
</p>
<p>among the people to whom it was first delivered."
</p>
<p>Some of the passages adduced by Gieseler we will
</p>
<p>translate. Jerome (Epist. xxx. al. 1., to Pammachins)
</p>
<p>thus defends the propriety of lying in certain cases : " It
</p>
<p>is one thing to write controversially, another didactically,
</p>
<p>or dogmatically, (yv/ju/aa-nxws, ^o/jxa-ixwg.) In the former
</p>
<p>the controversy is not restricted by fixed principles, and
</p>
<p>he who is replying to an antagonist may state now one
</p>
<p>thing, now another ; may argue as he pleases ; may de-
</p>
<p>clare one thing, but act on the opposite supposition ; may
</p>
<p>pretend to show bread (as the saying is) when he has in
</p>
<p>his hands nothing but a stone. But in the second kind
</p>
<p>of writing, openhearted frankness, and, if I may so say,
</p>
<p>candor and ingenuousness, are necessary."
</p>
<p>For evidence that they were disposed to allow far too
</p>
<p>great a latitude of accommodation, (oixovofwa.) attributing
</p>
<p>it in the same extent to Jesus and the apostles, see
</p>
<p>Suicer, s. v. <fuyxa<ra8a.fts. T. ii. p. 1067.
</p>
<p>In this way Jerome wished to explain the passage,
</p>
<p>(Gal. ii. 11, seq.,) but was opposed by Augustine, whose
</p>
<p>principles were more strict. (See his writings On Lying
</p>
<p>and Against Lying. See correspondence on this point
</p>
<p>between them, Epist. Hieron., Ep. Ixv. Ixvii.-lxxiii. Ixxvi.)
</p>
<p>Chrysostom On the Priesthood, vol. i. 5, lays down very
</p>
<p>questionable principles ; concerning the lawfulness of de-
</p>
<p>ception in certain cases. He was followed in this by his
</p>
<p>pupil, John Cassian, Coll. xvii. 8, seq. ; e. g., cap. xvii. :

<p>" Therefore we ought to regard and use falsehood as if it

<p>THE FORGERIES OP THE MIDDLE AGES. 287
</p>
<p>were of the nature of hellebore, which, if taken when
</p>
<p>threatened by a deadly disease, is salutary, but if without
</p>
<p>e necessity caused by such danger, results in immediate
</p>
<p>eath. For God not merely investigates and judges our
</p>
<p>words and actions, but also regards our purpose and
</p>
<p>intention. But if he sees that any thing has been done
</p>
<p>or promised by any one for the sake of eternal salvation
</p>
<p>and with that perception of results which proceeds from
</p>
<p>divine contemplation, although it appears to men shame-
</p>
<p>less and unjust, yet he, regarding the interior piety of the
</p>
<p>heart, will consider in his decision, not the sound of the
</p>
<p>words, but the purpose of the will ; for the end of an
</p>
<p>undertaking and the disposition of the agent are to be con-
</p>
<p>sidered. In this way some, as has been remarked before,
</p>
<p>have been able to secure justification by lying, (e. g., Ra-
</p>
<p>hab, Josh. ii. ;) and others, by telling the truth, have in-
</p>
<p>curred the penalty of eternal death, (e. g., Delilah, Judg.
</p>
<p>xvi.")
</p>
<p>Yet at this time they tithed mint, anise, and cumin.
</p>
<p>The neglect of ecclesiastical forms was a great crime.
</p>
<p>All oaths, the taking of interest, self-defence, capital pun-
</p>
<p>ishments, and second marriages were reckoned as crimes.
</p>
<p>In comparison with the violation of mere ceremonial laws,
</p>
<p>a disregard of the weightier matters of truth and justice
</p>
<p>was deemed a venial offence, or even a virtue, if meant
</p>
<p>for good ends. Hence we can see how men could come
</p>
<p>to such a state of mental delusion as to perpetrate for
</p>
<p>good ends the abominable imposition of the invention of
</p>
<p>the cross. Hence we can see how even Ambrose could
</p>
<p>conspire with a butcher to hide bones and blood under
</p>
<p>the pavement of his church, and then pretend to be in-
</p>
<p>formed by a special revelation that the relics of the mar-
</p>

<p>heard before, were hid there, and that he should dig

<p>288 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>them up, and prepare for them a shrine, and transfer their
</p>
<p>remains to it with the solemn mockery of prayer and
</p>
<p>preaching, and that miracles of healing should be
</p>
<p>wrought by these remains, and that the bones and blooc
</p>
<p>should be sold for a great price. "Was not the end a
</p>
<p>good one ? Was it not important that the church of
</p>
<p>Milan should have influence and wealth ? Are not these
</p>
<p>means of doing good? But, alas! she had no martyrs.
</p>
<p>Hence there could be no shrine, no saint worship, no
</p>
<p>miracles of healing, no casting out of devils, and, above
</p>
<p>all, no precious gifts. Why, then, should there not be an
</p>
<p>invention of martyrs as well as an invention of the
</p>
<p>cross ? To be sure, if it were to be found out, it might
</p>
<p>seem a shameless fraud to man ; but God would judge
</p>
<p>in view, not of the words, but of the purpose of the heart.
</p>
<p>Hence, too, the working of false miracles for a good
</p>
<p>end admitted of an easy justification, and no less the
</p>
<p>forging of saints and the ascription to real saints of mir-
</p>
<p>acles which they never wrought. Hence the deluge of
</p>
<p>saints' lives and miracles with which the world was
</p>
<p>flooded and the Romish world still is flooded ; for in
</p>
<p>Alban Butler these forged saints keep their place even
</p>
<p>to this day. Hence, too, we find in leading men, both in
</p>
<p>the Latin and Greek churches, shameless lying for any
</p>
<p>ends that interested men could convince themselves were
</p>
<p>good ends.
</p>
<p>The celebrated Photius, no doubt, regarded it as of
</p>
<p>great importance that he should be patriarch of Constan-
</p>
<p>tinople for the glory of God and the good of the church.
</p>
<p>Hence he did not hesitate to give to the emperor a letter
</p>
<p>in the name of Ignatius severely censuring the emperor,
</p>
<p>and another in the name of the pope in favor of Photius,
</p>
<p>which Eustralius, arriving at Constantinople in the habit

<p>of a monk, had delivered to him. And yet there is no
</p>
<p>THE FORGERIES OP THE MIDDLE AGES. 289
</p>
<p>reason to doubt that he had caused these letters to be
</p>
<p>forged in order to get Ignatius, whom the pope declared
</p>
<p>to be the true patriarch, out of the way. Lotharius (or
</p>
<p>Bishop Adventinus of Mentz for him) did not hesitate to
</p>
<p>forge the tale that he was married to "Waldrada, when
</p>
<p>young, by the command of the Emperor Lotharius, his
</p>
<p>father, and was afterwards forced by Count Herbert to
</p>
<p>marry his sister ; and Bishop Adventinus related it as a
</p>
<p>fact in the council of Aix-la-Chapelle. He also wrote for
</p>
<p>him a lying letter to the pope, and finally lied to excuse
</p>
<p>himself to the pope.
</p>
<p>When we meet with such things in the leading charac-
</p>
<p>ters of the nominal church, when we find in Gregory VII.
</p>
<p>a system of deliberate lying, adapted and designed to re-
</p>
<p>duce the world to one vast feudal monarchy, of which he
</p>
<p>should be the head and the kings of the earth his vassals,
</p>
<p>instead of feeling that we are in the kingdom of God,
</p>
<p>we seem to be involved in the deepest gloom of hell it-
</p>
<p>self, and are, for a moment, overwhelmed with horror and
</p>
<p>amazement. But, when we trace the system to its origin,
</p>
<p>we see that a single key is enough to open the bottomless
</p>
<p>pit ; and, as we read the corrupt maxims of some of the
</p>
<p>leading doctors of the church, we seem to see a star fall
</p>
<p>from heaven to earth, and take the key of the bottomless
</p>
<p>pit and open it, and to behold the smoke as of a great
</p>
<p>furnace arising from the pit, till the sun and the air are
</p>
<p>darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. Never was
</p>
<p>there such a lesson, as it regards the danger of tampering
</p>
<p>with the truth even in the least degree, as may be read
</p>
<p>in the history of the church. Let us look at the perni-
</p>
<p>cious effects of the system of pious frauds on the litera-
</p>
<p>ture and moral condition of earlier and of subsequent
</p>
<p>ages. Waddington, speaking of the literary forgeries that
</p>
<p>corrupted and disgraced the ante-Nicene church, says,

<p>290 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>" Their immediate effect was exceedingly injurious." We
</p>
<p>will hint at some of their effects.
</p>
<p>1. They tended to degrade the moral character of the
</p>
<p>age by the circulation of degrading materials of thought.
</p>
<p>The truths of God's word are pure, simple, elevating.
</p>
<p>The devil might well exult to see the people of God neg-
</p>
<p>lecting such heavenly food and turning away to feed on
</p>
<p>false gospels, Sibylline oracles, spurious saints' lives, and
</p>
<p>degraded and degrading acts and decisions of the apostles.
</p>
<p>2. They have immeasurably injured the interests of all
</p>
<p>subsequent ages. The welfare of all ages is involved in
</p>
<p>the correctness of the historical and literary documents
</p>
<p>of the early ages. Nowhere is historical truth more im-
</p>
<p>portant ; and yet, through the influence of the system of
</p>
<p>pious frauds, nowhere is it harder to be discerned. The
</p>
<p>decision of whole controversies is prevented by the doubt-
</p>
<p>ful state of early documents. To illustrate this, it is suf-
</p>
<p>ficent to refer to the interminable controversies as to
</p>
<p>what Ignatius actually said concerning bishops. We know
</p>
<p>that his letters have been more or less interpolated for
</p>
<p>purposes of pious fraud ; but who can tell how much ?
</p>
<p>By this uncertainty whole controversies are kept alive
</p>
<p>that otherwise would easily be settled. Let any one read
</p>
<p>Binius, Baronius, and Bellarmine, and then try to strike
</p>
<p>out all that is spurious and forged in their writings, and
</p>
<p>he will find himself in a labyrinth at once.
</p>
<p>3. The earlier forgeries furnished principles and prece-
</p>
<p>dents for worse deeds ; and very soon the lowest depths
</p>
<p>were reached by men speaking lies in hypocrisy and hav-
</p>
<p>ing their consciences seared as with a hot iron. Bad as
</p>
<p>are the forged decretals, they are no worse, except in ex-
</p>
<p>tent, than many preceding forgeries. Nothing can be
</p>
<p>worse than the attempts by Popes Zosimus and Celestine

<p>cause the council of Nice was an ecumenical council
</p>
<p>and that of Sardica was not.
</p>
<p>4. They provoke God to abandon the church, and thus
</p>
<p>to send strong delusion to believe a lie. Whately well
</p>
<p>says, that how far any one who propagates a lie may be
</p>
<p>himself deceived or may be guilty of pious fraud, and
</p>
<p>how far a fraud is a pious fraud, God only knows. Prob-
</p>
<p>ably most have begun in wilful deceit and advanced to-
</p>
<p>wards superstitious belief. Those who report a lie often
</p>
<p>believe it. The curse on those who do not love the truth
</p>
<p>is strong delusion to believe a lie. Thus a man intent on
</p>
<p>an end may first deceive himself into a belief that it is
</p>
<p>a good end, and then that it is right to lie to gain it, and
</p>
<p>finally that the lie is a truth. Many are conscientious in
</p>
<p>the sense that they have led their conscience to approve
</p>
<p>the purposes of the will, and not that their conscience
</p>
<p>has led their will to form its purposes. They persevere
</p>
<p>in wrong till they convince themselves that it is right.
</p>
<p>THE FORGED DECRETALS.
</p>
<p>Let us now consider the most perfect development of
</p>
<p>this system in the forged decretals.
</p>
<p>We have already taken a brief view of these. Let us
</p>
<p>more fully develop the great mystery of iniquity.
</p>
<p>The ultimate result of them was twofold to concen-
</p>
<p>trate the bishops round the pope and subject them to his
</p>
<p>authority ; and to raise the ecclesiastical above the civil
</p>
<p>power.
</p>
<p>To accomplish this, they seemed to propose to defend
</p>
<p>the bishops against the tyranny of their own metropoli-
</p>
<p>tans and of their civil rulers. Before the Papal despot-

</p>
<p>ism was established bishops were tried and judged by the
</p>
<p>292 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>bishops of a metropolitan province under their metropol-
</p>
<p>itan, and without appeal to the pope. Of course they
</p>
<p>were liable to injustice ; and if the metropolitan were
</p>
<p>imperious and haughty, as was often the case, they were
</p>
<p>to expect often to experience it. Hence very likely the
</p>
<p>origin of the canons of the council of Sardica. But as
</p>
<p>these only authorized the pope to command a new trial in
</p>
<p>the province, the main and ultimate power was, after all,
</p>
<p>not in the pope, but in the metropolitan. But to remove
</p>
<p>the case to the court of Rome, and to put the power of a
</p>
<p>final decision into the hands of the pope, would effectu-
</p>
<p>ally break down the power of the metropolitans. And
</p>
<p>if at any time they were guilty of abusing that power, it
</p>
<p>would create in the bishops a wish to see it done. In
</p>
<p>like manner bishops might wish a defence of their spirit-
</p>
<p>ual power against their kings.
</p>
<p>Things were tending in this direction when the forged
</p>
<p>decretals made their appearance. They purport to be
</p>
<p>decretal letters written by the early popes, from Clement
</p>
<p>downwards to Gregory the Great. They were published
</p>
<p>in a collection with other canons. This collection of can-
</p>
<p>ons and decretals, in the name of St. Isidore, consisted of
</p>
<p>three parts.
</p>
<p>1. Fifty-nine pseudo-Isidorian decretals, besides two
</p>
<p>from Clement to James, already in existence, going down
</p>
<p>to Melchiades.
</p>
<p>2. Canons of councils, chiefly genuine Isidorian.
</p>
<p>3. Thirty-five pseudo-Isidorian, mixed with genuine,
</p>
<p>epistles from Sylvester to Gregory the Great.
</p>
<p>The bishops universally received them. They were like
</p>
<p>the horse which was so intent on conquering the stag that
</p>
<p>he took the bridle into his mouth from the man, and the
</p>
<p>saddle upon his back, and allowed him to mount, and was

</p>
<p>from that time a slave. The pope conquered the metro-
</p>
<p>THE FORGERIES OF THE MIDDLE AGES. 293
</p>
<p>politans through the bishops ; and as soon as he had done
</p>
<p>this the bishops were ipso facto enslaved. These decretals
</p>
<p>seemed to favor the patriarchs, and yet subjected them to
</p>
<p>the pope's authority to act in his name. All that was
</p>
<p>taken from the metropolitans fell finally to the Papal see.
</p>
<p>To complete the picture, we will briefly restate some con-
</p>
<p>nected facts. The donation of Constantino was promul-
</p>
<p>gated in the time of Adrian L, and was based on, and con-
</p>
<p>nected with, a fabulous narrative of the baptism and cure of
</p>
<p>Constantine of the leprosy at Rome by Pope Sylvester. In
</p>
<p>token of gratitude Constantine withdrew from Rome and
</p>
<p>founded Constantinople, and gave to the pope Rome, Italy,
</p>
<p>and the provinces of the West.
</p>
<p>The history and decrees of a council that never met
</p>
<p>were also forged. It was said to have been held at Rome
</p>
<p>in the days of Sylvester : the aim and result of it were to
</p>
<p>exalt the power of the pope.
</p>
<p>We have given portions of these precious documents
</p>
<p>from the history of councils by Binius, published under
</p>
<p>the sanction of the pope, and defended by Binius even
</p>
<p>after Calvin and others had exposed the forgeries of the
</p>
<p>decretals. Indeed the Papacy held on to them till they
</p>
<p>were irresistibly wrung from its unwilling grasp.
</p>
<p>The influence and effects of these decretals are thus set
</p>
<p>forth by the learned civilian Daunou, a Roman Catholic :
</p>
<p>" So early as the end of the eighth century the decretals
</p>
<p>of Isidore had planted the germs of pontifical omnipo-
</p>
<p>tence. Gratian gathered the fruit of these germs and
</p>
<p>made them still more fruitful ; the court of Rome being
</p>
<p>represented as the source of all irrefragable decision, as
</p>
<p>the universal tribunal which decided all differences, dissi-
</p>

</p>
<p>and by the untitled faithful. There was no limit to the
</p>
<p>pontifical correspondence but such as was imposed by the
</p>
<p>tardiness of the means of communication. The affluence
</p>
<p>of questions multiplied bulls, briefs, epistles ; and from
</p>
<p>those fictitious decretals ascribed to the popes of the first
</p>
<p>ages there sprang up and multiplied, from the time of Eu-
</p>
<p>gene III., thousands of responses and decrees which were
</p>
<p>but too authentic. All affairs religious, civil, judiciary,
</p>
<p>domestic then were more or less embarrassed by pre-
</p>
<p>tended connections with the spiritual power. General in-
</p>
<p>terests, local controversies, individual quarrels all went
</p>
<p>in the last resort, and sometimes in the first instance, to
</p>
<p>the pope ; and the court of Rome acquired this influence
</p>
<p>over the details of human life, (if we may so speak.) which
</p>
<p>is of all others the most formidable, precisely because each
</p>
<p>of its effects, isolated from the others, appeared to be of
</p>
<p>no great consequence. Isidore and Gratian transformed
</p>
<p>the pope into a universal administrator."
</p>
<p>The agency of Gratian in this matter, to which Daunou
</p>
<p>here refers, was in brief this : In 1152 he compiled a col-
</p>
<p>lection, of canons, commonly designated as the " Decree
</p>
<p>of Gratian." It was called by him the concord of dis-
</p>
<p>cordant canons, (concordantia discordantium canonum.) The
</p>
<p>study of the civil law had just been revived in Italy by the
</p>
<p>discovery of the Pandects of Justinian. But, as the eccle-
</p>
<p>siastical power was fast gaining the ascendency over the
</p>
<p>civil power, a similar storehouse of the principles of eccle-
</p>
<p>siastical law was needed. Such the Decree of Gratian
</p>
<p>became. It is divided into three parts : one devoted to
</p>
<p>principles and ecclesiastical persons ; the second to judg-
</p>
<p>ments ; the third to things.
</p>
<p>Of its character as a code Daunou thus speaks : " Rep-
</p>
<p>etitions, impertinences, disorder, errors in proper names,

</p>
<p>mistakes in quotations are the least faults of the compiler.
</p>
<p>THE FORGERIES OP THE MIDDLE AGES. 295
</p>
<p>Mutilated passages, chimerical canons, false decretals, all
</p>
<p>sorts of lies abound in .this monstrous production. Its
</p>
<p>success was only the more rapid on that account. It was
</p>
<p>explained in the schools, cited in the tribunals, and in-
</p>
<p>voked in treaties. It had almost become the public law
</p>
<p>of Europe, when the return of light dissipated by slow
</p>
<p>degrees the gross imposture. By it the clergy were held
</p>
<p>not to be amenable to answer in the secular tribunals ; the
</p>
<p>civil powers were subjected to ecclesiastical supremacy ;
</p>
<p>the state of persons or the acts which determine it were
</p>
<p>regulated, validated, or annulled absolutely by the canons
</p>
<p>and the clergy ; the Papal power was enfranchised from
</p>
<p>all restrictions ; the sanction of all laws of the church was
</p>
<p>ascribed to the holy see that see itself being independent
</p>
<p>of the laws published and confirmed by itself."
</p>
<p>By whom Gratian was employed to perform this work
</p>
<p>the facts just stated sufficiently show. He was but a tool
</p>
<p>of the Papacy. Through him the man of sin erected his
</p>
<p>throne by reducing the forged decretals to a legal system.
</p>
<p>A translation of a few passages from Gratian will give a
</p>
<p>clear idea of the prevailing spirit of the work. He is
</p>
<p>teaching the doctrine that the pope is not of necessity
</p>
<p>subject even to his own laws, and that if he submits to
</p>
<p>them it is only by a voluntary humiliation by way of ex-
</p>
<p>ample to others.
</p>
<p>"As Christ, the Lord of the Sabbath and of the law,
</p>
<p>submitted himself to the law of the Sabbath, so the pon-
</p>
<p>tiffs in the seat of supremacy manifest reverence for the
</p>
<p>canons established either by themselves or by others
</p>
<p>authorized by them ; and, by humbling themselves to obey
</p>
<p>them, they augment their authority, so that they may
</p>
<p>present them to others as their supreme law." Again :
</p>
<p>" Sometimes, either by new enactments, or definitions, or
</p>
<p>by contravening the canons, they proclaim themselves

<p>lords and creators of the laws." Again : " Upon others
</p>
<p>296 THE PAPAL CONSPIEACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>is imposed the necessity of obedience to the canons ; but
</p>
<p>it has been made manifest that in the chief pontiffs there
</p>
<p>is an authority to obey at their pleasure, so that, by ob-
</p>
<p>serving their own decrees, they may show to others that
</p>
<p>they are not to be contemned. This they do after the ex-
</p>
<p>ample of Christ, who himself observed as an example, and
</p>
<p>that he might thus sanctify them, those sacraments, the
</p>
<p>observance of which he enjoined upon his church."
</p>
<p>Here we see the roots of those highest claims of Papal
</p>
<p>omnipotence, and of dispensing above right, and contrary
</p>
<p>to right, which subsequent canonists carried to a still
</p>
<p>more blasphemous extreme exalting the pope not only
</p>
<p>to an equality with God, but above all that is called. God
</p>
<p>or is worshipped.
</p>
<p>All these principles, first drawn from the fountain of
</p>
<p>the forged decretals, still slumber in the canon law, like
</p>
<p>a sword returned for a time to its sheath, or like the re-
</p>
<p>tracted and hidden claws of a tiger. But let the state of
</p>
<p>the nation be so changed, and circumstances so favor that
</p>
<p>it can be done, and the sword will be again unsheathed,
</p>
<p>and the pontifical tiger will again rend the subjugated
</p>
<p>nations with his claws.
</p>
<p>To translate long passages from these forged decretals
</p>
<p>would be tiresome alike to the translator and to the
</p>
<p>reader. To form a conception of their matter and style,
</p>
<p>we need only to suppose an ecclesiastic, capable of writing
</p>
<p>in the Latin style of the middle ages, first raising the in-
</p>
<p>quiry, What is needed to exalt the ecclesiastical entirely
</p>
<p>above the civil power? and finally to concentrate all
</p>
<p>power in the pope, and then writing all that he could con-
</p>
<p>ceive of to his heart's content in the name of the ancient
</p>
<p>popes. A few specimens must suffice. Hear how, in the
</p>
<p>first epistle of Pius, A. D. 147, the bishops are defended

</p>
<p>shepherd, nor the laity accuse a bishop, nor the populace
</p>
<p>reprehend him ; since the disciple is not above his lord,
</p>
<p>nor the servant above his master. But the bishops are
</p>
<p>to be judged by God, who has chosen them as his eyes.
</p>
<p>* * * Of this the Master has given an example, when
</p>
<p>he drove from the temple the buying and selling priests,
</p>
<p>by himself, and not by another." The judgment of God
</p>
<p>on bishops is of course to be exercised through the pope.
</p>
<p>Hence the forger tells us, through Zephyrinus, A. D. 208,
</p>
<p>Ep. i., " Let not the patriarchs or primates who try an
</p>
<p>accused bishop pass a definite sentence till it has been
</p>
<p>sanctioned by apostolic (i. e., Papal) authority." He then
</p>
<p>proceeds to give rules as to accusers, witnesses, and the
</p>
<p>trial, and then concludes : " Let the ultimate determination
</p>
<p>of his case be brought to the apostolic seat, that there it
</p>
<p>may be issued. Nor let it be finally determined before it
</p>
<p>is sanctioned by the authority of the pontiff, as was or-
</p>
<p>dained by the apostles or their successors." We notice
</p>
<p>here, as through all of these forgeries, a constant repetition
</p>
<p>and superabundant fulness, as if the writer were deter-
</p>
<p>mined to make assurance doubly sure in all things re-
</p>
<p>lating to the Papal authority.
</p>
<p>To concentrate all power at Rome, we find passages
</p>
<p>like this : " The Roman church, through the merits of
</p>
<p>Peter, consecrated by the word of the Lord and sustained
</p>
<p>by the authority of the holy fathers, holds the primacy
</p>
<p>among all the other churches. To her the highest con-
</p>
<p>cerns, trials, and complaints of bishops, and also the im-
</p>
<p>portant interests of all churches are to be referred as to
</p>
<p>the head." Vigilius, Ep. ad Profuturum.
</p>
<p>Again : Zephyrinus, Ep. i., says, " All, and especially
</p>
<p>the oppressed, must have recourse to the Roman church,
</p>
<p>and appeal to her as to a mother, that they may be nour-

</p>
<p>ished by her breasts, and defended by her authority, and
</p>
<p>298 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>delivered from their oppressions ; for the mother neither
</p>
<p>can nor ought to forget her child."
</p>
<p>One great object of these forgeries is to give authority
</p>
<p>to Papal decrees as such, investing them with the power
</p>
<p>of laws, thus making the pope an independent legislator
</p>
<p>and an absolute despot. Hence the forger in the name of
</p>
<p>Damasus, Ep. iv., says, " All the decretals and the statutes
</p>
<p>of all our predecessors which have been promulgated con-
</p>
<p>cerning the ecclesiastical orders, and the discipline of the
</p>
<p>canons, it is our pleasure and decree that you and all
</p>
<p>bishops and priests shall observe ; so that, if any one shall
</p>
<p>infringe them, let him know that it is an unpardonable
</p>
<p>offence."
</p>
<p>The direct result of all this was to exalt the canons of
</p>
<p>the pope to an equality with the canons of general councils.
</p>
<p>Hence in the canon law both kinds are mixed up indiscrim-
</p>
<p>inately, and, as Daunou well remarks, the forged decretals
</p>
<p>became the source and model of innumerable and genuine
</p>
<p>Papal decretals in subsequent ages. Indeed these lying
</p>
<p>forgeries have been so thoroughly digested and absorbed
</p>
<p>into the system of the canon law that to this day they
</p>
<p>constitute its vital principles, its very life's blood.
</p>
<p>At the hazard of being tedious we will give a few
</p>
<p>more extracts from these forgeries, showing in what man-
</p>
<p>ner, by impudent and reiterated assertions, the power of
</p>
<p>the Papacy was established. The forger in the name of
</p>
<p>Damasus, Ep. vi., says, " It is lawful for the metropoli-
</p>
<p>tans, with their provincial bishops, to investigate the
</p>
<p>causes of the bishops and other weighty ecclesiastical
</p>
<p>matters, provided the bishops are all present and agree ;
</p>
<p>but to define and decide definitely on such points, or to
</p>
<p>condemn bishops without the authority of this seat, is not
</p>
<p>lawful ; for all, if it be necessary, ought to appeal to

<p>it and be sustained by its authority ; for, as you know,
</p>
<p>THE FORGERIES OF THE MIDDLE AGES. 299
</p>
<p>it -is not Catholic to convene a synod without its sanc-
</p>
<p>tion."
</p>
<p>The conduct of Hincmar in deposing Rothade, to which
</p>
<p>we have before adverted, shows plainly that he, though a
</p>
<p>learned canonist, had admitted no such principles as
</p>
<p>these. But when Nicholas encountered him, nullified his
</p>
<p>proceedings, and restored Rothade, he fell back upon
</p>
<p>these and similar passages of the forged decretals for his
</p>
<p>defence ; and certainly nothing could be better fitted to
</p>
<p>accomplish his purposes. It seems as if this passage had
</p>
<p>been forged with satanic foresight for the very case in
</p>
<p>hand. Nor is it to be wondered at that Nicholas exerted
</p>
<p>himself to the uttermost to give authority to a system by
</p>
<p>which he was invested with such absolute power.
</p>
<p>In the decretum of Gratian the forged materials were
</p>
<p>mixed up with the old and genuine canon law for the
</p>
<p>sake of hiding the cheat. In his endeavors to reconcile
</p>
<p>the discordances thus produced, Gratian of course de-
</p>
<p>cided in favor of the new Papal law ; and as, during the
</p>
<p>subsequent study of the canon law, new contradictions
</p>
<p>came to light, the popes gave new decisions, deciding of
</p>
<p>course in accordance with the principles of the forged
</p>
<p>decretals. As these new decretals multiplied, it became
</p>
<p>necessary to reduce them to system. Hence in 1234
</p>
<p>Gregory IX. employed the Dominican Raimund da Pen-
</p>
<p>nafort to compile a new collection of decretals in five
</p>
<p>books, almost entirely composed of later decretals, and
</p>
<p>in accordance with the spirit of the forged decretals.
</p>
<p>To this Boniface VIII. added a sixth book in five parts.
</p>
<p>To these, five books of Clementine Constitutions, by
</p>
<p>Clement V., were added, and also certain Extravagantes
</p>
<p>of John XXII. and five books of Extravagantes Com-
</p>
<p>munes. Such was the spirit, such the origin, and such

<p>the progress and completion of the canon law. The

<p>300 THE PAPAL COXSPIRACT EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>leaven of the old canon law, retained in the decretum of
</p>
<p>Gratian, so far as it was inconsistent with the new law,
</p>
<p>was purged out, and the Papacy was placed on the basis
</p>
<p>on which it has since stood even to this day.
</p>
<p>It is, indeed, a specimen of lying and forgery on a
</p>
<p>sublime scale ; and when we see all Christendom trem-
</p>
<p>bling before the frown of the pope, and the intellect of
</p>
<p>all Europe engaged in studying and commenting on this
</p>
<p>law, then we see completed the highest and most as-
</p>
<p>tounding result of the forged literature of the middle
</p>
<p>ages. The little fountain head of pious fraud which
</p>
<p>broke out in the early ages has given rise to a mighty
</p>
<p>river, emptying itself into a boundless ocean of unfathom-
</p>
<p>able delusion and fraud.
</p>
<p>How great the influence of these forgeries has been
</p>
<p>may be learned from the confessions even of candid
</p>
<p>Roman Catholics. The testimony of Daunou has been
</p>
<p>given. Fleury, though not so severe, is no less explicit
</p>
<p>in testifying to their pernicious influence on the church.
</p>
<p>"With him coincides Bossuet ; and the celebrated Charles
</p>
<p>Butler, in a brief account of the Roman and the canon
</p>
<p>law, in an. appendix to his Life of the Chancellor
</p>
<p>D'Aguesseau, does not hesitate to say, " To the com-
</p>
<p>pilations of Isidore and Gratian, one of the greatest mis-
</p>
<p>fortunes of the church, the claim of the popes to temporal
</p>
<p>power by divine right, may in some measure be attrib-
</p>
<p>uted. That a claim so unfounded and so impious, so
</p>
<p>detrimental to religion, and so hostile to the peace of
</p>
<p>the world should have been made is strange ; stranger
</p>
<p>yet is the success it met with."
</p>
<p>It is no less strange that so intelligent a man could
</p>
<p>not discover that all the remaining claims of the pope
</p>
<p>are alike unfounded and impious, detrimental to religion,

</p>
<p>In view of such facts it is that Gibbon severely, but
</p>
<p>justly, remarks that the Vatican and Lateran were an
</p>
<p>arsenal and manufactory, which, according to the occa-
</p>
<p>sion, have produced or concealed a various collection of
</p>
<p>false, or genuine, or corrupt, or suspicious acts, as they
</p>
<p>tended to promote the interests of the Romish church.
</p>
<p>Before the end of the eighth century, some apostolical
</p>
<p>scribe, perhaps the notorious Isidore, composed the decre-
</p>
<p>tals and the donation of Gonstantine the two magic
</p>
<p>pillars of the spiritual and temporal monarchy of the
</p>
<p>popes. (Vol. iii. 339.) "This humble title, 'peccator,' was
</p>
<p>ignorantly, but aptly, turned into ' mercator ' his merchan-
</p>
<p>dise was indeed profitable : a few sheets of paper were
</p>
<p>sold for much wealth and power. The edifice has subsisted
</p>
<p>after the foundations have been undermined." P. 340.
</p>
<p>To form any adequate idea of these abominable and
</p>
<p>blasphemous forgeries, they must be read. They are writ-
</p>
<p>ten in an assumed style of conscientious sanctity. Their
</p>
<p>authors pretend to be watchmen for souls, accountable to
</p>
<p>God for their fidelity ; and the penalty of disobedience is
</p>
<p>eternal damnation. Yet the impious forgery betrays itself
</p>
<p>on every page. Of the events and wants of their own age
</p>
<p>they say and seem to know nothing. "With the hierarchi-
</p>
<p>cal claims of the distant future centuries they are perfectly
</p>
<p>familiar. They do not know the times of their own lives,
</p>
<p>or pontificates, or deaths. Some date their letters before
</p>
<p>they were popes some after they were dead. They
</p>
<p>quote the Latin Vulgate long before it was made. They
</p>
<p>quote writers who in their day had not written, laws
</p>
<p>that had not been made, councils that had not been held,
</p>
<p>and use words and a style of language not then in exist-

<p>decisive. Such are the documents which Nicholas I. pro-

</p>
<p>mnlgated in the name of God, and which for centuries
</p>
<p>ruled the world. ,
</p>
<p>Let us, in conclusion, consider the subsequent state and
</p>
<p>power of the system. The church of Rome has indeed
</p>
<p>retreated from certain positions, from which she has been
</p>
<p>irresistibly driven. But never has she abandoned the
</p>
<p>practice of the system ; and, if any have seemed in her
</p>
<p>name to condemn it in principle, this condemnation is
</p>
<p>but a new specimen of pious fraud. She cannot condemn
</p>
<p>it. It is wrought into her whole history. Moreover it is
</p>
<p>a case of necessity to that church to lie. Her existence
</p>
<p>depends on it. All true history is against her. Hence we
</p>
<p>see a constant tendency to rely on and defend forged
</p>
<p>documents in Baronius, and to forge lies in Bellarinine,
</p>
<p>as in his infamous narrative of the death of Calvin ; also
</p>
<p>in Audin's Life of Calvin the same course is pursued. In
</p>
<p>the same spirit, a stupendous enterprise was once under-
</p>
<p>taken to alter and expurgate all the fathers on the great
</p>
<p>scale.
</p>
<p>Hence Platina's History of the Lives of the Popes has
</p>
<p>been altered and corrupted by Papal scribes ; so that only
</p>
<p>the Venice edition, 1479, and the editions published in
</p>
<p>Holland, 1640, 1645, 1664, are worthy of confidence.
</p>
<p>Hence we may account for the omission in some editions
</p>
<p>of the statements concerning Gregory VII. which De
</p>
<p>Cormenin quotes. Hence, too, the systematic writing of
</p>
<p>false histories for the use of Jesuit schools ; and the falsi-
</p>
<p>fication of Ranke's History of the Popes, of which he
</p>
<p>complains, and the circulation and use of such falsified
</p>
<p>copies in Jesuit schools as genuine. Pagi says, " Much has
</p>
<p>been said of the popes by other historians, but very little
</p>
<p>by their own."
</p>
<p>Bower adds " that the very little has been thought

<p>the sixteenth century, to speak with more reserve, and to
</p>
<p>suppress or disguise some truths they had formerly told."
</p>
<p>Yol i. p. 15.
</p>
<p>When to the influence of principles so corrupt is added
</p>
<p>the bias of party rage, as in the long strifes of the Guelphs
</p>
<p>and Ghibelines, or in the great schism, one can easily im-
</p>
<p>agine the extent to which lying would be carried, and how
</p>
<p>much the difficulty of coming at the truth in many cases is
</p>
<p>augmented. As these parties fought with the sword, so,
</p>
<p>says Bower, did historians with more rage fight with their
</p>
<p>pens ; and the same persons, especially the popes and em-
</p>
<p>perors, are by opposing writers painted in very different
</p>
<p>colors.
</p>
<p>Indeed so thoroughly has this leprosy of pious lying
</p>
<p>struck through the Romish church that all who are approx-
</p>
<p>imating to her seem naturally to fall into it. Of this we find
</p>
<p>a striking example in the English Puseyites, who are re-
</p>
<p>viving the doctrine of economy, or accommodation viz.,
</p>
<p>lying so far as is necessary to keep their hearers from re-
</p>
<p>volting from their sentiments till they can lead them along
</p>
<p>step t)y step to Rome. Hence Newman's fierce assaults
</p>
<p>on Rome, as he begun his Puseyite movement, were all a
</p>
<p>pious fraud, according to the principles of the economical
</p>
<p>system, to be recanted when they had enabled him to
</p>
<p>corrupt all whom he could. On the same principles, Je-
</p>
<p>suits in secret may join any church and profess any thing
</p>
<p>in order to work in the dark for Rome.
</p>
<p>No maxim has ever been so constantly carried out in all
</p>
<p>ages as that to lie for the Romish church is not only no
</p>
<p>sin, but a virtue of the highest kind. On this principle
</p>
<p>pious frauds are at this day knowingly carried on in Mex-
</p>
<p>ico, as described by Waddy Thompson, in Rome, and in

</p>
<p>the government of God cannot last forever ; but it lias a
</p>
<p>great temporary power.
</p>
<p>For a hierarchy of priests, many of them men of educa-
</p>
<p>tion and great intellectual power and learning, and trained
</p>
<p>to lie on system, to sustain their own corporate power and
</p>
<p>wealth, can keep the masses subjected to their sway in
</p>
<p>Romish countries in utter ignorance of the facts of history,
</p>
<p>as is universally the case, and by bold assertions can
</p>
<p>paralyze to a certain extent the power of history in
</p>
<p>Protestant countries.
</p>
<p>The bold inpudence of Pope Zosimus staggered all the
</p>
<p>assembled bishops of Africa. He declared certain canons
</p>
<p>of the provincial council of Sardica to be canons of the
</p>
<p>council of Nice, though it was held twenty years before
</p>
<p>that of Sardica.
</p>
<p>The canons of Sardica were in none of the African
</p>
<p>copies of the council of Nice. The African bishops pro-
</p>
<p>posed to send for copies to Constantinople, Alexandria,
</p>
<p>and Antioch.
</p>
<p>" It matters not," replied the conscious legate, " whether
</p>
<p>or not those canons are to be found in your copies, or in-
</p>
<p>deed in any other. You must know that the canons and
</p>
<p>ordinances of Nice, which have been handed down to us
</p>
<p>BY TRADITION and established by custom, are no less bind-
</p>
<p>ing than those that have been conveyed to us by writing."
</p>
<p>A fine specimen of matchless impudence ! But so has Rome
</p>
<p>made tradition in all ages her grand storehouse of lies.
</p>
<p>The African bishops would not be so deluded. They
</p>
<p>sent for the copies as proposed, exposed the fraud, and
</p>
<p>held up the pope as a barefaced impostor.
</p>
<p>Bower well calls it one of the most impudent and bare-
</p>
<p>faced impostures recorded in history ; yet Bishop Kenrick
</p>
<p>has not a word of censure for the pope, and tries, like Ba-

<p>ronius and Bellarmine, to gloss it over as a mistake.
</p>
<p>THE FORGEKIES OP THE MIDDLE AGES. 305
</p>
<p>The truth is, on the principles of that church there was
</p>
<p>no sin in the lie, but merely in attempting it in so bungling
</p>
<p>a way as to be found out and exposed. So did Purcell.
</p>
<p>of Cincinnati, twice lie, and was publicly exposed.
</p>
<p>But multitudes of other impostures, equally gross and
</p>
<p>impudent, were not found out, and made the Papal power
</p>
<p>what it is ; and the same impudent system of lying will
</p>
<p>still be pursued, for nothing else can preserve it from ruin.
</p>
<p>This general view should not, however, lead to despair of
</p>
<p>a final victory of truth nor to historical scepticism. Let
</p>
<p>a man look at one of our counterfeit detectors containing
</p>
<p>scores of pages of counterfeits. He might at first say, It
</p>
<p>is of no avail to try to distinguish between forged and
</p>
<p>true bills. But with care and practice it can be done.
</p>
<p>So is it in history. Many forgeries have been so exposed
</p>
<p>that none dare now advocate them ; and, notwithstanding
</p>
<p>the delusions and lies of the hierarchy, God has foretold,
</p>
<p>under the symbol of the false prophet, his doom. He
</p>
<p>shall be taken by the Son of man and cast alive into the
</p>
<p>lake of fire burning with brimstone.
</p>
<p>Clearly then all Protestants are simpletons who do not
</p>
<p>judge Romanist ecclesiastics in view of their principles
</p>
<p>and their past history. He that is simple believeth every
</p>
<p>word of such men ; but the prudent looketh well to his
</p>
<p>going.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would say that the good of our nation
</p>
<p>requires a more full exposure of this subject than we can
</p>
<p>now make, with the facts of history classified and ar-
</p>
<p>ranged. We are contending with a matchless system of
</p>
<p>compacted fraud, and need to have a perfect understand-
</p>
<p>ing of it and its principles and deeds.

<p>CHAPTER Y.
</p>
<p>THE ROCK PETER AND LEO THE GREAT.
</p>
<p>WE have seen that in the forged decretals the rock
</p>
<p>Peter was made the foundation of the immense fabric of
</p>
<p>fraud and forgery. We have seen, also, by what course
</p>
<p>of corruption the Romish ecclesiastics had been prepared
</p>
<p>for such a forgery.
</p>
<p>But the success of that great forgery implies that an-
</p>
<p>other work had been previously performed ; it implies
</p>
<p>that the public mind had been prepared to receive the
</p>
<p>forgery by a preceding course of claims and precedents
</p>
<p>on the part of the popes which the forgers could imbody
</p>
<p>and establish by the pretended decretals of the earlier
</p>
<p>popes.
</p>
<p>We have also said that Leo the Great, who closes the
</p>
<p>second division of the popes, was the main agent in de-
</p>
<p>veloping and establishing such claims and pretensions.
</p>
<p>We intimated, moreover, our purpose to consider more
</p>
<p>fully his agency in thus laying the deepest foundation of
</p>
<p>the great Papal fabric.
</p>
<p>We will make him, as we already have Nicholas I., a
</p>
<p>sort of mountain top from which to survey the widely-
</p>
<p>extended field of the Papal campaigns.

</p>
<p>cretals, lived, as we have seen, in the deep midnight of

<p>the dark ages. The whole fabric of the western Roman

<p>empire had been long broken up, the empire of Charle-
</p>
<p>magne had arisen, its power had waned, and the interests
</p>
<p>of Europe were then in the hands of his feeble successors
</p>
<p>and of the Pope of Rome.
</p>
<p>Let us now go back to the time just before the great
</p>
<p>breaking up of the Western Empire and see how Leo pre-
</p>
<p>pared the pretended bark of Peter to launch into the
</p>
<p>great deluge of the northern nations that immersed Eu-
</p>
<p>rope in a second flood, out of which has arisen the new
</p>
<p>world of modern Europe.
</p>
<p>LEO THE GREAT.
</p>
<p>History is made up of two elements facts which
</p>
<p>transpire in this world and the relations of those facts
</p>
<p>to the universal system. That there was such a man as
</p>
<p>Leo the Great ; that he lived in the fifth century ; that he
</p>
<p>was a leading spirit of his age ; that he was engaged in
</p>
<p>divers controversies and aimed at certain definite ends,
</p>
<p>these and similar things are facts easily ascertainable
</p>
<p>and capable of a definite and precise statement ; nor with
</p>
<p>regard to the leading facts of his life is there any con-
</p>
<p>troversy.
</p>
<p>But when we pass to the consideration of the relations
</p>
<p>of these facts to the universal system we enter at once a
</p>
<p>new world. Whilst generations of men die, higher and
</p>
<p>permanent orders of spiritual beings meet our eyes. Each
</p>
<p>generation of men- has its principles, ends, and aims ; but
</p>
<p>no common intelligible human plan runs through the his-
</p>
<p>tory of all ages. To discover such a plan we must pass
</p>
<p>into the invisible world and study the designs of Him of
</p>
<p>whom, and through whom, and to whom are all things,
</p>
<p>and who worketh all things after the counsel of his

<p>308 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>To give the relations of the facts of history from this
</p>
<p>point of vision is by no means so easy as to state the
</p>
<p>facts. It leads us at once upon controverted ground.
</p>
<p>The moment we raise this question as it regards Leo we
</p>
<p>meet the great controversy of the age. To the partisans
</p>
<p>of Rome he is Leo the Great to their opponents he is
</p>
<p>but a prominent founder of a terrific and malignant anti-
</p>
<p>Christian system which was matured and perfectly devel-
</p>
<p>oped by Nicholas L, Gregory VII., and Innocent III.
</p>
<p>God only can write a perfect history of the world from
</p>
<p>this point of vision, and at the day of the revelation of his
</p>
<p>just judgment he will do it. Meantime there is to be even
</p>
<p>on earth, under the guidance of his Spirit, an historical
</p>
<p>day of judgment. On no subject has more illusion and
</p>
<p>fraud been practised, especially since the days of Christ,
</p>
<p>than on the history of this world. But the day cometh
</p>
<p>that shall burn as an oven. God is yet to reign ; and he
</p>
<p>will reign by the truth, and not by delusion and fraud.
</p>
<p>No one, therefore, is more concerned in promulgating and
</p>
<p>establishing correct views of the history of this world than
</p>
<p>he. In all our inquiries, then, let us entreat him to dissi-
</p>
<p>pate all delusions, to open our eyes, to purify our hearts,
</p>
<p>and to touch our lips as with a coal from his own altar.
</p>
<p>In the historical sketch which we have undertaken to
</p>
<p>present we have chosen an individual to stand as the cen-
</p>
<p>tral figure of the picture ; and yet our mainf design is,
</p>
<p>through him, to evolve the principles and spirit of the
</p>
<p>Romish corporation in his age.
</p>
<p>Leo was chosen Bishop of Rome A. D. 440, and died
</p>
<p>A. D. 461, after an eventful reign of twenty-one years.
</p>
<p>From 423 to 455 Valentinian III. was Emperor of the
</p>
<p>West. Maximus, Avitus, and Majorianus ruled during the
</p>
<p>remaining six years of his life. From 408 to 450 Theo-

</p>
<p>dosius II. was Emperor of the East ; Marcian from 450 to
</p>
<p>THE ROCK PETER AND LEO THE GREAT. 309
</p>
<p>457 ; Leo, also called the Great, from 457 to 474. Such
</p>
<p>were his contemporary civil rulers.
</p>
<p>As to his parentage and early education little is known.
</p>
<p>He was a Roman by birth. His father's name was Quinc-
</p>
<p>tianus. His first appearance in history is just before his
</p>
<p>choice as Bishop of Rome. He was sent by Pope Sixtus
</p>
<p>III. to effect a reconciliation between Aetius and Albinus
</p>
<p>in Gaul, of which we shall soon speak. During his ab-
</p>
<p>sence Sixtus died, and Leo was chosen in his place.
</p>
<p>The main characteristic of the age of Leo was the ap-
</p>
<p>proaching destruction of those institutions of Roman civil
</p>
<p>society which paganism had formed. Concerning these
</p>
<p>Guizot remarks, " The civil society of the Roman world,
</p>
<p>to all outward appearances, seemed Christian equally
</p>
<p>with the religious society. The great majority of the Eu-
</p>
<p>ropean nations and kings had embraced Christianity ; but
</p>
<p>at the bottom the civil society was pagan. Its institutions,
</p>
<p>its laws, its manners were all essentially pagan. It was
</p>
<p>entirely a society formed by paganism, not at all a soci-
</p>
<p>ety formed by Christianity. Christian civil society did
</p>
<p>not develop itself till a later period, till after the invasion
</p>
<p>of the barbarians. It belongs in point of time to modern
</p>
<p>history. In the fifth century, whatever outward appear-
</p>
<p>ances may say to the contrary, there existed between civil
</p>
<p>society and religious society incoherence, contradiction,
</p>
<p>contest ; for they were essentially different both in their
</p>
<p>origin and in their nature."
</p>
<p>" I would pray you never to lose sight of this diversity ;
</p>
<p>it is a diversity which alone enables us to comprehend the
</p>
<p>real condition of the Roman world at this period."
</p>
<p>This political society was enervated, and rapidly ap-
</p>
<p>proaching dissolution and death : slavery and the deep

</p>
<p>degradation of the masses of the people were the main
</p>
<p>310 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>causes of this state of things. The barbarians were God's
</p>
<p>instruments for breaking in pieces that old fabric which
</p>
<p>was tottering to its fall and ready soon to vanish away.
</p>
<p>Hence the names of Alaric, Attila, and Genseric begin
</p>
<p>to figure on the page of history ; and the Vandals, Franks,
</p>
<p>Goths, Visigoths, and Burgundians, under the guidance
</p>
<p>of such leaders, issue from the North to execute the pur-
</p>
<p>poses of God.
</p>
<p>A period of political dissolution and chaos is to ensue,
</p>
<p>during which a new religious society is to exercise a
</p>
<p>centralizing and organizing power. Of this society Leo
</p>
<p>claimed to be the divinely ordained head ; and his whole
</p>
<p>energies were put forth to develop and establish the prin-
</p>
<p>ciples of the Papal monarchy. Never was there a point
</p>
<p>in which a great mind, swayed by ambition, and not con-
</p>
<p>trolled by a regard to truth, had a finer opportunity to
</p>
<p>exercise a creative and organizing power.
</p>
<p>In various ways the Bishop of Rome had already ob-
</p>
<p>tained great influence. But he was by no means monarch
</p>
<p>of the Christian world. Indeed never had there been a
</p>
<p>time when he had rivals so powerful as were now the pa-
</p>
<p>triarchs of Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, and especially
</p>
<p>of Constantinople.
</p>
<p>The power of these bishops originated from two sources
</p>
<p>one political, the other spiritual. The former was
</p>
<p>in fact the only source of the extraordinary and despotic
</p>
<p>powers they were intent on establishing. Of this we
</p>
<p>have a full illustration in the history of the see of Con-
</p>
<p>stantinople. The Bishop of Byzantium was at first but a
</p>
<p>suffragan to the Bishop of Heraclea, exarch of the dio-
</p>
<p>cese of Thrace.
</p>
<p>But Constantine made Byzantium a new Rome ; and lo,
</p>
<p>the Bishop of Byzantium soon becomes the leading patri-

</p>
<p>arch in all the East ; for it was not fit that the emperor's
</p>
<p>THE BOCK PETEB AND LEO THE GREAT. 311
</p>
<p>bishop should be inferior in rank or power to any of the
</p>
<p>bishops of the East. His central political position, too,
</p>
<p>gave him the same means of augmenting his power which
</p>
<p>the Bishop of Rome enjoyed at the West ; and diligently
</p>
<p>and skilfully did he use them, and rapidly did he gain on
</p>
<p>the Bishops of Home in the race.
</p>
<p>And if the political basis of the bishop's power were to
</p>
<p>continue the main one, it was plain that if Old Rome fell,
</p>
<p>and New Rome stood, the patriarch of Constantinople
</p>
<p>might finally win in the race.
</p>
<p>It was certainly a critical period. Some master spirit
</p>
<p>was needed fully to develop and establish the doctrine
</p>
<p>that the |ower of the Bishop of Rome had a higher ori-
</p>
<p>gin than that of the Bishop of Constantinople ; so that,
</p>
<p>even if Old Rome fell, his spiritual kingdom might not
</p>
<p>only remain unshaken, but take her place and rise upon
</p>
<p>her ruins.
</p>
<p>Such a master spirit was needed. In Leo he was found.
</p>
<p>A Roman by birth, of powerful intellect, indomitable will,
</p>
<p>dauntless courage, vivid imagination, great power of emo-
</p>
<p>tion, a finished education, extensive learning, a majestic
</p>
<p>person, and fervid eloquence, he was beyond all doubt
</p>
<p>immeasurably superior, in most of those elements which
</p>
<p>give power over mind, to all the men of his age. He is
</p>
<p>worthy to be placed side by side with Nicholas I., Greg-
</p>
<p>ory VII., and Innocent III.
</p>
<p>But, considering the claims of the see of Rome to be the
</p>
<p>great preserver of the faith on earth, it is not a little re-
</p>
<p>markable that Leo is the first theological writer of any
</p>
<p>ability which the see of Rome produced, the first who
</p>
<p>has left any important work for the benefit of posterity,
</p>
<p>if we omit the apostle Peter and the evangelical and
</p>
<p>primitive Clement.

</p>
<p>Before Leo, the leading champions of the faith did not
</p>
<p>312 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>come from the see of Rome. So far from it was the fact,
</p>
<p>that the faith would have been betrayed had it been left
</p>
<p>solely to the Bishop of Rome. Athanasius, Bishop of Al-
</p>
<p>exandria, was the great pillar of the doctrine of the Trin-
</p>
<p>ity ; whilst Pope Liberius signed an Arian creed. Augus-
</p>
<p>tine, Bishop of Hippo, was the great champion of the
</p>
<p>doctrine of human depravity and the sovereign grace of
</p>
<p>God ; whilst Pope Zosimus became the champion of Pe-
</p>
<p>lagianism till compelled by the power and perseverance
</p>
<p>of Augustine to recant. Popes Julius and Felix, long be-
</p>
<p>fore Eutyches, had promulgated the Eutychian doctrine,
</p>
<p>which the whole energy of Leo and after ages labored in
</p>
<p>vain utterly to overthrow and eradicate. .
</p>
<p>The great writers of the East and the West, Augustine
</p>
<p>and Basil, Athanasius and Ambrose, the Gregories and
</p>
<p>Chrysostom, had adorned their respective sees ; whilst
</p>
<p>Rome remained in a state of comparative intellectual and
</p>
<p>theological barrenness till Leo arose.
</p>
<p>But the moment he appeared on the stage the centre of
</p>
<p>both ecclesiastical and intellectual power was no doubt at
</p>
<p>Rome. With a strong hand and a determined will he
</p>
<p>grasped all the great questions of the age, and made an
</p>
<p>impress on the world that is felt to this day. He gave a
</p>
<p>decided turn to theology and to the current of events in
</p>
<p>favor of the see of Rome ; nor, judging by their standards,
</p>
<p>have the partisans of that see erred in calling him LEO
</p>
<p>THE GREAT.
</p>
<p>The acts of his life may be arranged in five classes :
</p>
<p>1. Those which related to the existing interests of the
</p>
<p>Roman empire as endangered by the barbarians.
</p>
<p>2. Those which relate to the powers of the see of Rome.
</p>
<p>3. Those which relate to the vindication and establish-
</p>
<p>ment of the orthodox system of faith.
</p>
<p>4. Those which relate to the use of force in the sup-

<p>pression of heresy.
</p>
<p>THE ROCK PETER AND LEO THE GREAT. 313
</p>
<p>5. Those which relate to the discipline of the church.
</p>
<p>It will be seen at a glance that all his acts except those
</p>
<p>of the first class related to principles destined to exert a
</p>
<p>vast influence on all future generations. Whatever may
</p>
<p>be thought of the character of the Romish church, no one
</p>
<p>can deny that it was for ages the centre of intellectual and
</p>
<p>ecclesiastical power for Christendom. No point of vision
</p>
<p>gives so comprehensive an insight into the religious and
</p>
<p>political condition of the Christian world for ages. An
</p>
<p>emotion of sublimity, therefore, fills the mind as we stand
</p>
<p>at the fountain head of this great river of destiny and
</p>
<p>watch the elements that are from time to time mingled
</p>

</p>
<p>of the earlier or later downfall of Rome. That mistress
</p>
<p>of the world was thoroughly corrupt. Her measure of
</p>
<p>iniquity was nearly full. All that Leo could do for her was
</p>
<p>for a little time to delay her fall. When, A. D. 440, under

<p>the weak rule of Yalentinian, the safety of Rome was en-
</p>
<p>dangered by the alienation of Aetius, the greatest Roman
</p>
<p>general of the age, and Albinus, a Gallic lord of great
</p>
<p>power, and this at the very time when the empire was

<p>overrun by the Goths, Burgundians, Franks, and Huns,
</p>
<p>Leo was chosen, as qualified above all others by eloquence,
</p>
<p>sagacity, and tact, to reconcile them. To effect this, he was
</p>
<p>sent on an embassy to Gaul. He fulfilled his mission with
</p>
<p>such success that he stood conspicuous in the eyes of his
</p>
<p>own generation as a great peace.maker and the savior of

<p>314 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>driven by Aetius out of Gaul, had invaded Italy, and, hav-
</p>
<p>ing captured Aquileia, Pavia, and even Milan, the imperial
</p>
<p>residence, were preparing to lay siege to Rome, Leo was
</p>
<p>sent at the head of an embassy to him, that he might exert
</p>
<p>the power of his effective eloquence and address upon the
</p>
<p>mind of the terrible leader of the barbarians. Without
</p>
<p>the aid of a vivid imagination, it is easy to invest this
</p>
<p>transaction with a peculiar and impressive dramatic in-
</p>
<p>terest. All hearts were dismayed ; even Aetius trembled
</p>
<p>before the barbarian hosts ; when lo, the gates of Rome
</p>
<p>open, and her bishop, in sacerdotal robes and with majes-
</p>
<p>tic aspect, goes forth to try the force of intellectual and
</p>
<p>spiritual arms against the victorious leader of barbarian
</p>
<p>hosts. To the natural and inherent interest of the scene
</p>
<p>religious fiction has sought to superadd a new intensity
</p>
<p>by introducing a miraculous appearance of Peter and
</p>
<p>Paul to second the eloquence of Leo. It is enough, how-
</p>
<p>ever, for us to know that the embassy was successful.
</p>
<p>Attila retired, and Rome for a time was saved. It is
</p>
<p>added by others that a pestilence in the camp of Attila,
</p>
<p>the invasion of his own country by Marcian, the prospect
</p>
<p>of speedy and powerful reinforcements for the Romans,
</p>
<p>and the stipulation of an annual tribute of two thousand
</p>
<p>pounds of gold were the real influences that gave power
</p>
<p>to the eloquence of Leo. Be this as it may, the glory that
</p>
<p>he has derived from the success of this mission has been
</p>
<p>great. Yet, after all, it accomplished little for Rome, and
</p>
<p>still less for the world. It affected, as we have safd, no
</p>
<p>great principle, and it caused but a brief delay of the
</p>
<p>downfall of Rome. Even the same Leo at a later date in
</p>
<p>vain exerted his eloquence to deter Genseric from the sack
</p>
<p>of Rome. Summoned by Eudoxia, the widow of Valentin-
</p>
<p>ian, to avenge her on Maximus, who had slain her husband,

</p>
<p>plundered Rome, and carried away, not only vast treasures,
</p>
<p>but also many Romans as slaves. At the request of Leo,
</p>
<p>he only consented to save the city from the flames.
</p>
<p>2. Let us now come to those acts of Leo that related to
</p>
<p>principles destined to increase in power till they should
</p>
<p>ingulf all other power in their tremendous vortex. We
</p>
<p>have already remarked that the power of the Bishop of
</p>
<p>Rome was originally based upon the political supremacy
</p>
<p>of Rome. Even Newman, in an argument designed to
</p>
<p>conduct his disciples into the bosom of Rome, is obliged
</p>
<p>to admit that the doctrine of the " regalia Petri" was unde-
</p>
<p>veloped in the early ages. He intimates, indeed, that it
</p>
<p>slumbered in the record, ready to be developed when needed ;
</p>
<p>but it is a very suspicious fact that the new basis of the
</p>
<p>claims of the pretended succession of Peter was not dis-
</p>
<p>covered till the political basis seemed to be in danger of
</p>
<p>being subverted by the superior political power of the
</p>
<p>Bishop of Constantinople. Then the hidden sense of
</p>
<p>" Thou art Peter " began to open rapidly on the mind of
</p>
<p>Leo ; and with imperious energy he thus sets it forth in his
</p>
<p>letter to the Bishops of Gaul: "It was the will of our
</p>
<p>Lord that all nations should hear the truth through the
</p>
<p>apostolic trumpet. Yet it was also his pleasure that the
</p>
<p>blessed Peter should preside over the other apostles in the
</p>
<p>discharge of this duty ; so that all divine gifts should flow
</p>
<p>to the body from him as the head, so that none could
</p>
<p>partake of the blessings of the kingdom of God who
</p>
<p>should-dare to depart from the rock Peter. This office
</p>
<p>of Peter Christ proclaimed when he said, ' Thou art Peter'
</p>
<p><fcc. Thus the structure of the eternal temple, by the
</p>
<p>wonderful grace of God, was made to rest on the rock
</p>
<p>Peter." In all this there is NOW no originality ; but in the
</p>
<p>days of Leo there was need of his master mind to give

</p>
<p>currency to this doctrine. With reference to him Gieseler
</p>
<p>316 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>says, " By exalting the authority of the apostle Peter, and
</p>
<p>by tracing all his rights to this source, as well as by his
</p>
<p>personal qualities and good fortune, he did more than any
</p>
<p>of his predecessors in extending and confirming the power
</p>
<p>of the Romish see."
</p>
<p>Gieseler also, in section ninety-two, says that " this view
</p>
<p>was first fully developed by Leo." Bower, however,
</p>
<p>has shown, from a letter of Innocent I. (A. D. 401-417) to
</p>
<p>Alexander, Bishop of Antioch, that the merit or de-
</p>
<p>merit of first developing this idea belongs to Innocent.
</p>
<p>In that letter he derives the prerogatives, privileges, and
</p>
<p>jurisdiction of the Roman see from St. Peter. In view
</p>
<p>of this Bower remarks, " Innocent may be justly said to
</p>
<p>have pointed out the ground on which the unwieldy fabric
</p>
<p>of the Papal power was afterwards built." Still it is
</p>
<p>true, as Gieseler asserts, that Leo first FULLY developed
</p>
<p>this view. THUS, THEN, INNOCENT I. ORIGINATED IT AND
</p>
<p>ACCUSTOMED THE EARS OF MEN TO HEAR IT. LEO FULLY
</p>
<p>DEVELOPED AND TO HIS UTMOST POWER ENFORCED IT.

<p>GREGORY VII. ERECTED THE FABRIC, AND INNOCENT III.
</p>
<p>REIGNED IN THE MERIDIAN SPLENDOR, OF PAPAL GLORY.
</p>
<p>Nor was Leo at all deficient in that unprincipled bold-
</p>
<p>ness and energy which were essential in order to enforce
</p>
<p>such claims of authority. This was especially seen in his
</p>
<p>encounter with that distinguished Romish saint, Hilary,
</p>
<p>Bishop of Aries and Exarch of the seven provinces of
</p>
<p>Narbonne. A council of bishops in which Hilary pre-
</p>
<p>sided had deposed Celidonius, Bishop of Besanon. He
</p>
<p>appealed to Leo. Hilary denied the right of Leo to re-
</p>
<p>ceive the appeal and review their proceedings ; Leo main-
</p>
<p>tained it. The fifth canon of the council of Nice con-
</p>
<p>demned the usurpation of Leo. Hilary went to Rome to

</p>
<p>protest against it. Leo arrested and confined him there,
</p>
<p>THE ROCK PETER AND LEO THE GREAT. 317
</p>
<p>and appointed a day for reviewing the case. Hilary es-
</p>
<p>caped from confinement and fled to Aries. Leo, enraged
</p>
<p>at his contumacy, reexamined the case, and, against noto-
</p>
<p>rious facts, declared Celidonius innocent, and restored
</p>
<p>him to his office as bishop. Nor did he stop here : he
</p>
<p>excommunicated Hilary, deprived him of all jurisdiction,
</p>
<p>suspended his episcopal functions, and abolished the
</p>
<p>dignity of exarch, formerly conferred on the see of Aries.
</p>
<p>Even this did not suffice : he wrote to the Gallic bishops
</p>
<p>a slanderous letter designed to blast the character and
</p>
<p>destroy the influence of Hilary. It was in this letter that
</p>
<p>the doctrine of the divine supremacy of Peter and his
</p>
<p>successors was first fully developed. His next step was to
</p>
<p>enlist the imperial power on his side. The weak Valen-
</p>
<p>tinian was by him deluded, misinformed, and thus led to
</p>
<p>confirm by an imperial edict all of his arrogant claims,
</p>
<p>and to state, in notorious contravention of facts, that the
</p>
<p>Bishop of Rome had always exercised the powers claimed
</p>
<p>by Leo. This edict occurs in Leo's works, and no doubt
</p>
<p>came from his pen. There is nothing in the forged de-
</p>
<p>cretals of a later age more thoroughly unprincipled than
</p>
<p>this conduct of Leo. Hilary never yielded to him, but
</p>
<p>died under his ban ; yet he continued to exercise all the
</p>
<p>functions of his office as before, respected by all who
</p>
<p>knew him as one of the most eminent Christians of the
</p>
<p>age. The Romish church, too, has refuted the slanders
</p>
<p>of Leo by canonizing him ; and even Leo, after the death
</p>
<p>of Hilary, was inconsistent enough to call him " Hilary
</p>
<p>of holy memory." Such was Leo the great ; such was
</p>
<p>the manner in which he toiled to lay the broad founda-
</p>
<p>tions of the Papal power. Since the Romish church has
</p>
<p>canonized Hilary, the Romanists are greatly perplexed to
</p>
<p>know what to say of the conduct of Leo. One author of
</p>
<p>the Life of Hilary omits his excommunication. Certainly,

<p>318 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>if Hilary was a saint, Leo was not ; yet both have been
</p>
<p>canonized. Hilary, perhaps, deserved the honor. On the
</p>
<p>other hand, the conduct of Leo was too profitable to
</p>
<p>Rome to pass without reward. It aided to lay the
</p>
<p>broad basis of all her powers. Therefore she has canon-
</p>
<p>ized him also. So, then, both Leo, who excommunicated
</p>
<p>Hilary, and Hilary, who died under his anathema, were
</p>
<p>both eminent saints. Consistent Rome !
</p>
<p>The same traits of character were displayed by Leo in
</p>
<p>his obstinate resistance of the twenty-eighth canon of the
</p>
<p>council of Chalcedon. In this, as we have already stated,
</p>
<p>was distinctly advanced the doctrine, that the power of
</p>
<p>the Bishop of Rome as well as of Constantinople was
</p>
<p>solely of political origin. Of the dangerous tendency of
</p>
<p>this doctrine Leo was too well aware, and resisted it with
</p>
<p>implacable hostility ; yet it was impossible with any
</p>
<p>show of historical truth to resist the canon. Leo there-
</p>
<p>fore supplied his lack of argument by imperious obstinacy
</p>
<p>and falsehood. But the canon of the council remains to
</p>
<p>this day, an unanswerable proof of the real origin of that
</p>
<p>great central despotism which at last claimed by divine
</p>
<p>right the supremacy of the whole Christian world. That
</p>
<p>large ecumenical council of six hundred bishops expressly
</p>
<p>say, " Since the fathers, properly conceded eminent pre-
</p>
<p>rogatives to the episcopal throne of old Rome, because of

<p>the political supremacy of that city, (<5t TO paodeieiv mv n6hy

</p>
<p>Constantinople, acting on the same principle, assigned
</p>
<p>equal prerogatives to the episcopal throne of New Rome ;
</p>
<p>thinking it suitable that a city honored by imperial au-
</p>
<p>thority and a senate, and enjoying equal political preroga-
</p>
<p>tives with Old-Rome, should possess an equal preeminence
</p>
<p>with her in ecclesiastical authority." The only differ-

</p>
<p>ence admitted by the council between the two sees was
</p>
<p>THE ROCK PETER AND LEO THE GREAT. 319
</p>
<p>not one of authority, but of honorary precedence, which
</p>
<p>was naturally assigned to the see of the oldest of the two
</p>
<p>cities. This, it is plain, is a doctrine totally subversive
</p>
<p>of the theory of Leo, that the supremacy of the Bishop of
</p>
<p>Rome is derived from the divine appointment of Peter to
</p>
<p>be the head of the church universal. But this is not all.
</p>
<p>The see of Constantinople was, by the council of Chal-
</p>
<p>cedon, invested with the right of receiving appeals from
</p>
<p>all other ecclesiastical tribunals whatever. This power,
</p>
<p>at least in words, was granted without any limitation.
</p>
<p>And even if, with Bower, we think that it had in reality
</p>
<p>reference to the Eastern church alone, yet it is plain be-
</p>
<p>yond a doubt that the council decided that the Bishop of
</p>
<p>Constantinople was entirely independent of the see of
</p>
<p>Rome. Still further : the universality of their language
</p>
<p>gave to the Bishop of Constantinople better ground to as-
</p>
<p>sume the title of universal bishop, and head of all the
</p>
<p>churches, and primate of the Christian world than the
</p>
<p>Bishop of Rome ever had. And when the Western Empire
</p>
<p>fell he did in fact put forth such claims, greatly to the ter-
</p>
<p>ror of Gregory the Great, who felt that his own throne was
</p>
<p>tottering to its fall. When, now, we consider the notorious
</p>
<p>fact that all churches were at first independent and equal,
</p>
<p>we shall see how immense was the chasm to be bridged over
</p>
<p>before the church of Rome could arrive at universal mon-
</p>
<p>archy by divine right over all the churches of the earth.
</p>
<p>We also see that intrepid forgery and lying were the only
</p>
<p>materials out of which the necessary bridge could be con-
</p>
<p>structed. The greatness, then, which is involved in found-
</p>
<p>ing the Romish power is of necessity based upon such ele-
</p>
<p>ments ; and for such greatness Leo, Nicholas L, Gregory
</p>
<p>VII., and Innocent III. were eminently distinguished.
</p>
<p>Leo could not resist the twenty-eighth canon of the

<p>council of Chalcedon except by forgery ; and accordingly
</p>
<p>320 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>he forged, or caused to be forged, an addition to the canons
</p>
<p>of the council of Nice. The legates of Leo produced in
</p>
<p>the council of Chalcedon a Latin translation of the sixth
</p>
<p>canon, in which the see of Rome was said always to have
</p>
<p>enjoyed the primacy. But the whole council regarded
</p>
<p>the addition as a forged interpolation ; and plainly they
</p>
<p>were right. It is inconsistent with the context, and has
</p>
<p>been since omitted in the best Latin translations of the
</p>
<p>canons. That Leo could retain any character or influence
</p>
<p>after such an infamous fraud, throws a striking light on
</p>
<p>the morality of the age. The leprosy of religious lying
</p>
<p>had so corrupted the nominally Christian community that
</p>
<p>to be exposed in it seemed to injure no man's character,
</p>
<p>standing, or influence. Well has inspiration given as one
</p>
<p>tra'it of the great apostasy, " Speaking lies in hypocrisy."
</p>
<p>Leo, after the council of Chalcedon, did not hesitate to
</p>
<p>profess a sacred regard to the council of Nice, and to
</p>
<p>oppose the obnoxious Chalcedonian decree by an appeal to
</p>
<p>his own forged addition to the decrees of Nice. And yet
</p>
<p>such was his personal influence and power that he was
</p>
<p>feared alike by the Eastern and Western emperors and
</p>
<p>by all the civilians and ecclesiastics of the age.
</p>
<p>In thus professing a supreme regard to the canons of
</p>
<p>Nice he was guilty of a gross inconsistency ; for the fifth
</p>
<p>of these canons ordered all appeals to be finally decided
</p>
<p>by the bishops of each province. Yet he excommunicated
</p>
<p>Hilary for adhering to this very canon and claiming final
</p>
<p>authority in the case of Celidonius against the imperious
</p>
<p>claims of the usurping Bishop of Rome. Again we say,
</p>
<p>What can be conceived of more unprincipled than the
</p>
<p>conduct of Leo ? Yet for this very conduct Rome has
</p>
<p>ever regarded him as Leo the Great. And well may she,

<p>so long as she retains her arrogant claims ; for they aro

<p>founded on nothing: else.
</p>
<p>THE ROCK PETER AND LEO THE GREAT. 321
</p>
<p>In the transactions which have passed under review we
</p>
<p>see the germs of some of the greatest developments of
</p>
<p>subsequent ages. In Leo I. we see the model of Nich-
</p>
<p>olas I., Hildebrand, and Innocent III. ; in his contest
</p>
<p>with Hilary, a preparation for the great controversy as to
</p>
<p>the Gallic liberties which nearly lost France to the Rom-
</p>
<p>ish church ; in his warfare with the see of Constantinople,
</p>
<p>the forerunner of the great Greek schism. Any one could
</p>
<p>easily have foreseen that Constantinople, the great rival
</p>
<p>of Old Rome, would sooner consent to lie under her
</p>
<p>anathema than tamely submit to her power.
</p>
<p>3. From acts so discreditable to Leo we gladly turn to
</p>
<p>consider his influence on the doctrines of the church ; for
</p>
<p>here we can find, results of his intellectual powers in
</p>
<p>which orthodox divines, both Romish and Protestant,
</p>
<p>concur to this day. We refer to his discussion of the
</p>
<p>great doctrine of THE UNION OP THE TWO NATURES OP
</p>
<p>CHRIST IN ONE PERSON. After what has been said of his
</p>
<p>unprincipled policy in extending the power of the see of
</p>
<p>Rome, it is perhaps little to the credit of the orthodox
</p>
<p>doctrine of the person of Christ that he should be found
</p>
<p>to be its great champion, and to have done more than any
</p>
<p>one person of antiquity in giving it the form in which it
</p>
<p>is now held. But truth does not cease to be truth even
</p>
<p>if advocated by an unworthy defender.
</p>
<p>The chief work of Leo upon this momentous theme is
</p>
<p>his letter to Flavianus, Bishop of Constantinople. The
</p>
<p>circumstances that called it forth were these : Eutyches,
</p>
<p>reacting from the reputed error of Nestorius, had main-
</p>
<p>tained that the divine and human natures after their
</p>
<p>union in Christ became OXE NATURE. For this he was
</p>
<p>condemned and deposed by a provincial council at Con-
</p>
<p>stantinople under Flavianus, bishop of that see. Eutyches

<p>appealed from the decision to an ecumenical council.
</p>
<p>322 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>He addressed his appeal in particular to the Bishops of
</p>
<p>Rome, Alexandria, Jerusalem, and Thessalonica. It was
</p>
<p>in answer to this appeal and in prospect of this council that
</p>
<p>Leo wrote his celebrated letter to Flavianus in opposition
</p>
<p>to Eutyches, in which he developed the true doctrine.
</p>
<p>This letter was afterwards received as canonical by the
</p>
<p>council of Chalcedon and by all the orthodox bishops.
</p>
<p>It was, says Bower, in the "Western churches read during
</p>
<p>the advent with the Gospels. The council of Rome
</p>
<p>anathematized all who should reject even a word of it.
</p>
<p>Gregory the Great made it the standard of orthodoxy on
</p>
<p>that point. The council of Apamea styled it " the true
</p>
<p>column of the orthodox faith ; " and some even caused it
</p>
<p>to be read to them at the point of death, in proof that
</p>
<p>they died in the true faith of the church. Such have been
</p>
<p>the fame and the power of this letter ; yet it was not at
</p>
<p>first received without opposition so violent as to require
</p>
<p>all the influence and energy of Leo to defend it.
</p>
<p>4. Our attention is next naturally called to the influence
</p>
<p>exerted by Leo on the great question of the use of force
</p>
<p>and the infliction of civil pains and penalties in the sup-
</p>
<p>pression of error. If any who were called at the origin
</p>
<p>of this question to investigate it, and to give form to the
</p>
<p>doctrine of the church on the subject, could have had a
</p>
<p>prophetic vision of such scenes as the massacre of St.
</p>
<p>Bartholomew, celebrated by the Te Deums at Rome, or of
</p>
<p>the dungeons, stakes, and autos dafe of the Inquisition,
</p>
<p>had they at all weighed the import of that fearful symbol,
</p>
<p>a harlot drunk with blood, with what fearful solicitude
</p>
<p>would they have entered upon the investigation ! But it

<p>does not belong of having originated the system of per-

</p>
<p>sccution for opinion's sake. But it must be said of him
</p>
<p>that he strengthened it when it was relatively weak and
</p>
<p>sanctioned it by his great influence, when, if he had re-
</p>
<p>sisted it with all his power, he might have destroyed it
</p>
<p>forever.
</p>
<p>The idea of inflicting civil pains and penalties for opin-
</p>
<p>ions sprang naturally out of the alliance between church
</p>
<p>and state. In the early ages of Christianity it was ut-
</p>
<p>terly repudiated. One form of subsequent intolerance
</p>
<p>was so plausible that it caused little apprehension ; it
</p>
<p>was the suppression of paganism by law, the destruction
</p>
<p>of heathen temples and implements of idolatry, the con-
</p>
<p>fiscation of property consecrated to such uses, and fines
</p>
<p>on the use of frankincense and libations. These things
</p>
<p>were done in the reigns of Gratian and Theodosius.
</p>
<p>Constantine and his immediate successors were tolerant
</p>
<p>towards the pagans. The edict of Milan indicates 'the
</p>
<p>original views of Constantine. It was a charter of re-
</p>
<p>ligious liberty to all. The spirit of persecution arose
</p>
<p>under the influence of THE HIERARCHY. Penal laws
</p>
<p>against heresy among Christians preceded the persecu-
</p>
<p>tions of pagans. Constantine issued two such laws, The-
</p>
<p>odosius fifteen, Arcadius twelve, Honorius eighteen. The
</p>
<p>Arians, Donatists, Pelagians, Manicheans, Priscillianists,
</p>
<p>and Paulicians were among the more prominent perse-
</p>
<p>cuted heretical sects. The Arians in their turn, when in
</p>
<p>the ascendant, retaliated on the orthodox. But the Ro-
</p>
<p>man laws did not punish heresy by death. Banishment,
</p>
<p>fine, confiscation of goods, infamy, disqualification to buy
</p>
<p>or sell, exclusion from civil and military honor were the
</p>
<p>common penalties. According to Mosheim, however,
</p>
<p>some of the Donatists were put to death A. D. 316,

<p>disregard of his decision against them, pronounced after

</p>
<p>a personal investigation their case having been previ-
</p>
<p>ously investigated by two councils summoned by his au-
</p>
<p>thority, and they having been twice before condemned.
</p>
<p>Of this infliction, however, other historians say nothing ;
</p>
<p>and Gieseler expressly says that the first instance of the
</p>
<p>judicial execution of a heretic was in the case of Priscil-
</p>
<p>lian, A. D. 385, who was, with others of his followers,
</p>
<p>tried and executed by the usurper Maximus, at the insti-
</p>
<p>gation of the Bishops Idacius and Ithacius. Hagenbach
</p>
<p>also says that the Priscillianists were the first heretics
</p>
<p>persecuted by the sword.
</p>
<p>It is worthy of note that this proceeding at that time
</p>
<p>met with general reprobation. In particular, Martin of
</p>
<p>Tours and Ambrose of Milan loudly condemned it ; and
</p>
<p>the instigators of the deed were finally expelled from
</p>
<p>their bishoprics.
</p>
<p>Such was the state of the Christian world on the sub-
</p>
<p>ject of persecution when Leo was called to meet the ques-
</p>
<p>tion, by the flight of large numbers of the Manichees to
</p>
<p>Rome from Carthage and the provinces which the Van-
</p>
<p>dals under Genseric had Overrun. A letter from Turri-
</p>
<p>bius, Bishop of Astorga, called his attention to the revi-
</p>
<p>val and spread of the heresy of Priscillian in Spain.
</p>
<p>Leo had now a glorious opportunity to set forth the true
</p>
<p>principles of religious liberty and to rectify the errors
</p>
<p>of preceding years. There was, it is plain, deep feeling
</p>
<p>in the church against punishing heretics by death, and
</p>
<p>the guilt and folly of all civil pains and penalties for er-
</p>
<p>roneous opinions could have been clearly shown. The
</p>
<p>authority of the earlier fathers could have been easily
</p>
<p>adduced against them. Tertullian had said, " Religion
</p>
<p>does not compel religion ; " Origen, " Christians should
</p>
<p>not use the sword ; " Lactantius, " Coercion and injury

</p>
<p>ity and piety greatly differ from each other : nor can
</p>
<p>truth be conjoined with violence, or justice with cruelty.
</p>
<p>Religion is to be defended, not by killing, but by dying ;
</p>
<p>not by inhumanity, but by patience." Cyprian had as-
</p>
<p>cribed to Christ alone the right to punish for opinions.
</p>
<p>Had Leo fallen back upon such authorities, and employed
</p>
<p>his great abilities in defence of religious liberty, how glo-
</p>
<p>rious had been his reward ! He could have turned back
</p>
<p>the Christian world to the true and lofty ground on
</p>
<p>which they once stood and averted the infamy of future
</p>
<p>ages. But how could a prelate, whose great object was
</p>
<p>to exalt the authority of his own see above that of all
</p>
<p>others, appreciate the dignity and glory of such an enter-
</p>
<p>prise? Power, centralization, rule were his great ideas ;
</p>
<p>to subjugate the human mind to ecclesiastical authority,
</p>
<p>not to give it liberty, was his great aim. His conduct
</p>
<p>may be inferred from these principles. It may be also
</p>
<p>inferred from the fact that in later times Maimbourg ap-
</p>
<p>peals to the writings of Leo to prove that heresy is a
</p>
<p>capital crime and may be justly punished with death.
</p>
<p>Leo, then, is one of the main fountain heads from which
</p>
<p>has issued that river of blood which in after ages deluged
</p>
<p>the world. How little could he comprehend the influence
</p>
<p>on after ages of a few words written by him in defence of
</p>
<p>the system of religious persecution !
</p>
<p>It is true that in the case of the Manichees he did not
</p>
<p>resort to capital punishment ; nay, he says that it was
</p>
<p>repugnant to the spirit of the church, and to that lenity
</p>
<p>in which she places her chief glory, abhorring to shed the
</p>
<p>blood even of the most detestable heretics. But the
</p>
<p>church of Rome has in all ages made the same profession.
</p>
<p>She has never shed the blood of heretics not she ! The
</p>
<p>true test is this : Has she ev.er justified the civil magistrate
</p>
<p>in shedding it ? Has she ever enjoined it upon him so to

<p>326 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>do ? So, in this case, the true test to be applied to Leo
</p>
<p>is this : How did he regard the execution of Priscillian
</p>
<p>and others by Maximus ? Did he justify and defend it ?
</p>
<p>Or did he, like Martin of Tours, reprobate and abhor it?
</p>
<p>To answer these questions, we only need to read his letter
</p>
<p>to Turribius, who had implored his assistance against the
</p>
<p>Priscillianists. In this he condemns their doctrines as im-
</p>
<p>pious and detestable ; declares that all who tolerate here-
</p>
<p>sies are no less guilty than those who embrace them ; and
</p>
<p>justifies the execution of Priscillian and some of his dis-
</p>
<p>ciples by Maximus. This is the letter to which Maim-
</p>
<p>bourg appeals to prove that heresy may justly be punished
</p>
<p>by death.
</p>
<p>But, even where Leo did not resort to the penalty of
</p>
<p>death, he used every other form of persecution with the
</p>
<p>utmost severity. He stirred up Valentinian to pass a
</p>
<p>law confirming all the persecuting edicts of his predeces-
</p>
<p>sors against the Manichees. Banishment, confiscation,
</p>
<p>exclusion from civil and military employments and hon-
</p>
<p>ors, incapacity to give or receive by will, to sue at law or
</p>
<p>make a contract, and compelling the whole community to
</p>
<p>act as irresponsible informers against them, these were
</p>
<p>the penalties attached to these laws ; and these Leo did not
</p>
<p>deem inconsistent with that lenity of the church in which
</p>
<p>she places her chief glory.
</p>
<p>Some have, indeed, attempted to defend the execution of
</p>
<p>Priscillian on the ground of the immoralities of which he
</p>
<p>was guilty and to which his system tended ; but, when
</p>
<p>we call to mind that the Romish party defend the mur-
</p>
<p>der of the Albigenses and Waldenses on the same ground,
</p>
<p>we ought to be suspicious of such a defence. The opin-
</p>
<p>ions of Priscillian were, indeed, grossly erroneous as they
</p>
<p>are now set forth. Neander says of them, that, " so far as

</p>
<p>we can gain any knowledge of them from the meagre
</p>
<p>THE EOCK PETER AND LEO THE GREAT. 327
</p>
<p>accounts of their adversaries, Dualism and the emanation
</p>
<p>theory were combined together in them elements relat-
</p>
<p>ed to Gnosticism and Manicheism. Their moral system,
</p>
<p>as their doctrine required, was rigidly ascetic. It enjoined
</p>
<p>austerities of all sorts, and in particular celibacy. The
</p>
<p>charges laid against them of dissolute conduct are, to say
</p>
<p>the least, not sufficiently well authenticated." Maximus,
</p>
<p>indeed, alleged that Priscillian confessed his crimes ; but
</p>
<p>Neander distrusts the confession if made, as probably in-
</p>
<p>voluntary and extorted by the rack. It should also be
</p>
<p>borne in mind that, after heretics have been executed,
</p>
<p>there is a uniform tendency in their persecutors to defend
</p>
<p>tftemselves by bearing false witness against their victims.
</p>
<p>Indeed it is always easy to change heretical contumacy
</p>
<p>into the crime of rebellion against the civil powers.
</p>
<p>It is, however, but fair to Leo to say that his is not the
</p>
<p>only great name of that age to whom the advocates of
</p>
<p>persecution may appeal for support. On a name far greater
</p>
<p>than his own the same opprobrium rests even that of Au-
</p>
<p>gustine, Bishop .of Hippo. He was originally tolerant in
</p>
<p>his views ; but becoming, as it would seem, impatient in con-
</p>
<p>sequence of the perversity of the Manichees and Donatists,
</p>
<p>he was led to advocate and defend the use of force. " It
</p>
<p>was by Augustine," says Neander, " that the theory was
</p>
<p>proposed and founded which contained the germs of that
</p>
<p>whole system of spiritual despotism, of intolerance, and
</p>
<p>persecution which ended in the tribunals of the Inqui-
</p>
<p>sition." By this it cannot be meant that the practice of
</p>
<p>persecution had not begun before Augustine, but that he
</p>
<p>first devised those sophistical arguments which in after
</p>
<p>ages were used in its defence. He did not defend it on
</p>
<p>the ground that force in itself tends to produce direct con-
</p>
<p>vie. ion of truth, but that by suffering the mind may be so

</p>
<p>he illustrated by a reference to the discipline of the prov-
</p>
<p>idence of God and of a father ia his family. He seemed
</p>
<p>not to notice that such discipline is not for error, but for
</p>
<p>sin, and that it involves no sense of violated rights ; whereas
</p>
<p>all efforts to convince by force do involve a sense of in-
</p>
<p>justice and tend to reaction. But wretched as this sophis-
</p>
<p>try is, falling in as it did with the tendencies of the age,
</p>
<p>it passed for argument. But sophistry much less subtle
</p>
<p>was resorted to by Leo in defence of the system of perse-
</p>
<p>cution to which he stood committed. In his letter to Tur-
</p>
<p>ribius he says, with reference to the execution of Priscillian,
</p>
<p>" Such a use of the sword has been advantageous to the
</p>
<p>exercise of the lenity of the church, who, although content
</p>
<p>to give ecclesiastical decisions and averse .to shed blood,
</p>
<p>is nevertheless aided by the severe laws of Christian
</p>
<p>princes ; since those who fear bodily punishment will be
</p>
<p>more readily disposed to seek spiritual salvation." One
</p>
<p>might almost suppose that these were the words of some
</p>
<p>gentle inquisitor of modern days whose tender heart re-
</p>
<p>volts from shedding blood, but is intent on saving the souls
</p>
<p>of his victims by the terrors of dungeons, the rack, the
</p>
<p>scaffold, and the fires of an auto dafe.
</p>
<p>5. We now come to consider the fifth and last class of
</p>
<p>the acts of Leo namely, those relating to the sacraments
</p>
<p>and discipline of the church.
</p>
<p>These topics, it must be conceded, much occupied his
</p>
<p>thoughts, and occur very frequently in his letters. And
</p>
<p>yet he accomplished little in these particulars that left a
</p>
<p>bold and definite impress on future ages. Indeed some
</p>
<p>of his decisions have since been reversed and branded as
</p>
<p>heretical by the church of Rome. This is particularly
</p>
<p>true of his decision on the effects of the baptism of here-
</p>
<p>tics. The present doctrine of the Romish church is, that

</p>
<p>such baptism is not devoid of saving power, but remits sin,
</p>
<p>THE ROCK PETER AND LEO THE GREAT. 329
</p>
<p>confers grace, and sanctifies as really as the baptism of the
</p>
<p>church. But Leo decided that those baptized by heretics
</p>
<p>received nothing but the external form of baptism, and
</p>
<p>still need an imposition of hands, and an invocation of
</p>
<p>the Holy Ghost by the church, in order to receive the in-
</p>
<p>ward power and sanctification of baptism.
</p>
<p>The celibacy of the clergy, one great pillar of the Papal
</p>
<p>edifice, Leo found already enjoined by a decree of his
</p>
<p>predecessor, Siricius, A. D. 385. He merely extended the
</p>
<p>prohibition to subdeacons, who had before been exempt
</p>
<p>from the law. Here, too, Leo failed to exert his power
</p>
<p>to check the progress of the Gnostic and ascetic apostasy.
</p>
<p>This pernicious interdiction of marriage to the clergy
</p>
<p>was totally unknown in the first three centurie^s. In the
</p>
<p>fourth, Jerome tells us that the married clergy were pre-
</p>
<p>ferred to the unmarried by the majority of the community.
</p>
<p>In the celebrated council of Nice, A. D. 325, it was pro-
</p>
<p>posed to enjoin continence on the clergy who were already
</p>
<p>married ; but Paphnutius, one of the most eminent prelates
</p>
<p>of the time, himself unmarried, vindicated the purity of
</p>
<p>the marriage state, and protested against imposing on the
</p>
<p>clergy burdens that they could not bear. The council,
</p>
<p>influenced by him, refused to enact the canon proposed.
</p>
<p>Still Paphnutius was in favor of celibacy in the clergy
</p>
<p>not already married. Sixty years after this, the decree
</p>
<p>of Siricius was promulgated, enjoining celibacy on the
</p>
<p>clergy, and soon after it was enjoined by councils in Af-
</p>
<p>rica, Gaul, Spain, and Germany. This resulted so directly
</p>
<p>from the spirit of the great Gnostic apostasy then coming
</p>
<p>to its crisis that Leo might have utterly failed if he had
</p>
<p>opposed it. But it would have been glorious even to fail
</p>
<p>in such an attempt. But nothing of the kind could be
</p>
<p>rationally expected from him ; nothing of the kind was
</p>
<p>attempted by him. He sanctioned a practice which has

</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI.
</p>
<p>PERIOD OF GREGORY VII., THE PATRON SAINT OF THE
</p>
<p>ROMISH BISHOPS OF THE UNITED STATES.
</p>
<p>"WE have called the period from the eleventh to the
</p>
<p>sixteenth century the Papal period. It is eminently
</p>
<p>such. It discloses the theory and practice of Popery
</p>
<p>in their perfection.
</p>
<p>It may with no less propriety be called the period of
</p>
<p>Gregory VIL, for he was the great master builder who
</p>
<p>combined the forgeries and frauds of all preceding ages,
</p>
<p>augmented by so'me of his own, into the model of that
</p>
<p>gigantic ecclesiastical despotism that during four centu-
</p>
<p>ries reigned sole monarch of Christendom.
</p>
<p>It becomes us, as Americans, to feel a peculiar interest
</p>
<p>in this period. The bishops of the Romish church who
</p>
<p>reside in these United States have seen fit to introduce
</p>
<p>into this free land the festival of that pontiff by whom
</p>
<p>this system of centralized despotism was founded and by
</p>
<p>whose principles it was established. He is therefore, in
</p>
<p>a peculiar sense, their patron saint.
</p>
<p>It is well that they have taken this ground. They are
</p>
<p>parts of the great central corporation. Each of them is
</p>
<p>bound to the pope by a feudal oath of which Gregory was
</p>
<p>the author. These men know its import and to what
</p>
<p>principles it commits them. They also know that his
</p>
<p>canonization implies a full sanction of these principles.

<p>332 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>Is it not well, then, for Americans to understand what
</p>
<p>they are ?
</p>
<p>We have seen what materials Leo I. and Nicholas I.,
</p>
<p>with their fellow-laborers in the same cause, had pre-
</p>
<p>pared. At the accession of Gregory VII. the time to use
</p>
<p>them had fully come.
</p>
<p>Two things were to be effected. The bishops were to
</p>
<p>be detached from all earthly sovereigns, and as subjugated
</p>
<p>vassals to be bound to the pope as their supreme lord by
</p>
<p>feudal oaths. The bishops also, and especially the pope,
</p>
<p>their head, were to be emancipated from subjection to the
</p>
<p>Emperor of Germany and other civil rulers, and made an
</p>
<p>independent spiritual power. Nor was this all. The
</p>
<p>kings of Europe were to be subjected to him as his sub-
</p>
<p>jects and vassals. To carry out the last part of this great
</p>
<p>scheme Gregory needed forgeries of his own for which,
</p>
<p>as we shall see, he was never at a loss. Let us now con-
</p>
<p>sider the execution of his plan.
</p>
<p>GREGORY ASSAILS HENRY IV.
</p>
<p>The imperial power had passed from the Frankish to
</p>
<p>the German emperors. The popes had risen from the
</p>
<p>degradation into which they fell for a time after the Pa-
</p>
<p>pacy of Nicholas I. The sceptre of the German empire
</p>
<p>was not swayed by an emperor of undisputed and resist-
</p>
<p>less authority like Otho the Great. On the other hand,
</p>
<p>Henry IV., a youth, was enfeebled by a rebellion among
</p>
<p>his Saxon subjects. There was also, to a considerable
</p>
<p>extent, a disposition among the barons of the empire to
</p>
<p>take sides with the pope against Henry, at least until they
</p>
<p>had reduced the power and prerogatives of the emperor.

</p>
<p>There is no reason to doubt that there were ju?t causes of
</p>
<p>PERIOD OF GREGORY VII. 333
</p>
<p>complaint against Henry ; but it was not a regard to
</p>
<p>them, but a purpose to emancipate the Romish church
</p>
<p>from the imperial power and to establish a theocracy
</p>
<p>over kings, that impelled Gregory in his usurping career.
</p>
<p>It was a right of the emperor to invest the Romish
</p>
<p>bishops in the empire with the insignia of spiritual and
</p>
<p>temporal authority, receiving from them at the same time
</p>
<p>an acknowledgment of his sovereignty and promises of
</p>
<p>allegiance. Gregory determined to wrest the whole of
</p>
<p>this authority from the emperor and to vest it in himself.
</p>
<p>He attacked him almost immediately after he had ascended
</p>
<p>the imperial throne and when weakened by the revolt of
</p>
<p>the Saxons. Alleging that the power of the emperors had
</p>
<p>been abused by the sale of bishoprics and otherwise, he
</p>
<p>commanded Henry to relinquish his prerogatives to the
</p>
<p>pope. Henry of course refused to comply with the inso-
</p>
<p>lent demand. Hereupon the pope summoned Henry to
</p>
<p>appear before him to answer to charges to be preferred
</p>
<p>against him. Henry, enraged at such usurping insolence,
</p>
<p>summoned a council at Worms and deposed Gregory and
</p>
<p>appointed a successor. Gregory then, in a council at
</p>
<p>Rome, deposed the emperor, and by authority received as
</p>
<p>he alleged from Peter, released his subjects from their al-
</p>
<p>legiance and forbade them to obey him. Thus was opened
</p>
<p>a new era in the history of the Papacy and of the world.
</p>
<p>In this act of deposition no reference at all was made
</p>
<p>to any complaints of the subjects of Henry against him.
</p>
<p>The only crime for which he was deposed was rebellion
</p>
<p>against St. Peter in the person of Gregory.
</p>
<p>This was the first act in a campaign of centuries. It
</p>
<p>inaugurated a new theocracy on earth. It disclosed a
</p>
<p>plan to make all kings but the humble vassals of the holy
</p>
<p>see of Rome.

<p>Had there been no civil war and no hostility to Henry
</p>
<p>THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>the deposition would have been powerless. As it was, it
</p>
<p>raised against him a powerful party, who determined to
</p>
<p>regard him as deposed and to appoint a successor unless
</p>
<p>Henry would submit to the pope and obtain absolution.
</p>
<p>And now the imperial majesty was degraded indeed.
</p>
<p>Urged by the danger of losing his crown, in midwinter,
</p>
<p>and at the expense of much toil and suffering, Henry
</p>
<p>crossed the Alps into Italy, and at the fortress of Canossa
</p>
<p>humbled himself before the pope and sought absolution.
</p>
<p>Gregory determined to use his power to degrade him to
</p>
<p>the uttermost. Three days he refused to see him, and
</p>
<p>kept him standing in the cold air imprisoned between the
</p>
<p>outer and inner walls of the castle, barefooted and in the
</p>
<p>garb of a penitent. Nor would he at last give the uncon-
</p>
<p>ditional absolution that Henry Demanded. He restored
</p>
<p>him to communion, but forbade him to reign until he had
</p>
<p>been tried before himself in a German council that was at
</p>
<p>hand.
</p>
<p>A large party of the Italian subjects of Henry, indig-
</p>
<p>nant at the insolence and usurpation of the pope, rallied
</p>
<p>around him ; and, thus encouraged, he refused to go to the
</p>
<p>council, and again defied the pope. Hereupon a succes-
</p>
<p>sor, Rodolph, Duke of Swabia, was appointed in Germany,
</p>
<p>to whom Gregory gave the crown, and from whom he re-
</p>
<p>ceived a feudal oath, as his vassal.
</p>
<p>Henry, however, defeated and slew Rodolph, and at
</p>
<p>last banished Gregory from Rome, established another
</p>
<p>pope as his successor, and from him received the im-
</p>
<p>perial crown.

<p>PERIOD OP GREGORY VII. 335
</p>
<p>which he had begun, and at the end of a century had
</p>
<p>gained the victory. In the days of Innocent III., to use
</p>
<p>the words of Hallam, " The maxims of Gregory VII. had
</p>
<p>been matured by more than a hundred years, and the right
</p>
<p>of trampling upon the necks of kings had been received,
</p>
<p>at least among churchmen, as an inherent attribute of the
</p>
<p>Papacy. ' As the sun and the moon are placed in the
</p>
<p>firmament,' (such is the language of Innocent,) ' the greater
</p>
<p>as the light of the day and the lesser of the night : thus
</p>
<p>are there two powers in the church the pontifical, which,
</p>
<p>as having the charge of souls, is the greater ; and the royal,
</p>
<p>which is the less, and to which the bodies of men only are
</p>
<p>intrusted.' Intoxicated with these conceptions, (if we may
</p>
<p>apply such a word to successful ambition,) he thought no
</p>
<p>quarrel of princes beyond the sphere of his jurisdiction."
</p>
<p>In another place he says, " The noonday of Papal dominion
</p>
<p>extends from the pontificate of Innocent III. inclusively
</p>
<p>to that of Boniface VIII. ; or, in other words, through the
</p>
<p>thirteenth century. Rome inspired during all this age
</p>
<p>the terrors of her ancient name. She was once more the
</p>
<p>distress of the world, and kings were her vassals."
</p>
<p>THE CANON LAW.
</p>
<p>Then was fully developed the canon law, based on the
</p>
<p>forged decretals, but rising even above them in extrava-
</p>
<p>gance of claims. The decretals of Gregory and of other
</p>
<p>pontiffs after him, especially of Innocent III., form a large
</p>
<p>portion of its substance. To exalt the Papacy above all
</p>
<p>earthly power is its great aim. It expressly declares that
</p>
<p>" the pope does not fill the place of a mere man, but of
</p>
<p>the true God on earth." It declares his divine right to de-

</p>
<p>allegiance. In short, it ascribes to him all the rights and
</p>
<p>prerogatives of God, and some which he does not claim.
</p>
<p>God never claimed superiority to the laws of right or the
</p>
<p>power to dispense with them. It was reserved for the
</p>
<p>Pope of Rome to make this claim. Thus has he exalted
</p>
<p>himself above all that is called God or worshipped ; thus
</p>
<p>has he, as God, sat in the temple of God, showing himself
</p>
<p>that he is God.
</p>
<p>THE BISHOP'S OATH.
</p>
<p>Of the Papal supremacy over kings enough has been
</p>
<p>said. The subjugation and centralization of the bishops
</p>
<p>were no less complete. By the law of celibacy they were
</p>
<p>detached from all local interests and ties ; and, to complete
</p>
<p>the work, the regulation, that no bishop should exercise his
</p>
<p>functions until confirmed by the pope, resulted in binding
</p>
<p>them all to him by a feudal oath as his conquered vassals.
</p>
<p>Of this regulation Hallam says, "It was one of vast impor-
</p>
<p>tance, through which, beyond, perhaps, any other means.
</p>
<p>Rome has sustained, and still sustains, her temporal influ-
</p>
<p>ence as well as her ecclesiastical supremacy." Such is the
</p>
<p>origin and such the influence of the odious, humiliating,
</p>
<p>and disgraceful bishop's oath. No rightminded man can
</p>
<p>regard without pity the degeneracy of the miserable men
</p>
<p>who take it.
</p>
<p>When we consider how gross the forgeries on which the
</p>
<p>Papal supremacy of jurisdiction is based, how directly and
</p>
<p>expressly it is in violation of the laws of Christ, and at
</p>
<p>war with the just liberty, equality, and independence en-
</p>
<p>joyed by the pastors of churches in the early ages, it will
</p>
<p>at once become apparent how utterly degraded is the
</p>
<p>position of all Romish bishops and how infamous the oath

<p>by which they are bound. That oath is as follows :
</p>
<p>PERIOD OP GREGORY VII. 337
</p>
<p>" I, N., elect of the Church of N., from henceforward
</p>
<p>be faithful and obedient to St. Peter the apostle, and
</p>
<p>to the holy Roman church, and to our lord the Lord N.,

<p>Pope N., and to his successors canonically coining in. I
</p>
<p>will neither advise, consent, or do any thing that may

<p>them under any pretence whatsoever. The counsel which
</p>
<p>they shall intrust me withal, by themselves, their messen-

<p>gers, or letters, I will not knowingly reveal to any to their
</p>
<p>prejudice. I will help them to defend and keep the Roman
</p>
<p>Papacy and the royalties of St. Peter, saving my order,
</p>
<p>against all men. The legate of the apostolic see, going
</p>
<p>and coming, I will honorably treat and help in his necessi-
</p>
<p>ties. The rights, honors, privileges, and authority of the
</p>
<p>holy Roman church, of our lord the pope, and his foresaid

<p>the said Roman church any thing to the hurt or prejudice

<p>of their persons, right, honor, state, or power ; and, if I

<p>shall know any such thing to be treated or agitated by any

<p>whatsoever, I will hinder it to my power, and as soon as

<p>I can will signify it to our said lord, or to some other by
</p>
<p>whom it may come to his knowledge. The rules of the

<p>said by a certain messenger hereto specially empowered,
</p>
<p>a member of my chapter, or some other in ecclesiastical
</p>
<p>dignity or else having a parsonage ; or, in default of these,
</p>
<p>by a priest of the diocese ; or, in default of one of the
</p>
<p>clergy (of the diocese,) by some other secular or regular
</p>
<p>priest of approved integrity and religion, fully instructed
</p>
<p>in all things above mentioned. And such impediment I
</p>
<p>will make out by lawful proofs to be transmitted by the
</p>
<p>foresaid messenger to the cardinal proponent of the holy
</p>
<p>Roman church in the congregation of the Sacred Council.
</p>
<p>The possessions belonging to my table I will neither sell,
</p>
<p>nor give away, nor mortgage, nor grant anew in fee, nor
</p>
<p>any wise alienate, no, not even with the consent of the
</p>
<p>chapter of my church, without consulting the Roman
</p>
<p>pontiff. And, if I shall make any alienation, I will there-
</p>
<p>by incur the penalties contained in a certain constitution put
</p>
<p>forth about this matter. So help me God and those holy
</p>
<p>Gospels of God."
</p>
<p>The real nature and origin of this oath cannot be hid-
</p>
<p>den for a moment. It regards the pope as a feudal mon-
</p>
<p>arch, and makes every bishop his sworn vassal obliged
</p>
<p>to come at his call, keep his secrets, defend his interests,
</p>
<p>assail, and if possible destroy, his enemies the heretics,
</p>
<p>and in all things be an obedient slave to his will.
</p>
<p>Let the origin of this oath, then, never be forgotten. Let
</p>
<p>the principles and practice of the age of Gregory VII., In-
</p>
<p>nocent III., and Boniface VIII. be recalled and reviewed as
</p>
<p>set forth in the first part of this work. Let the import of
</p>
<p>" the royalties of St. Peter," and " the rights, honors, priv-
</p>
<p>ileges, and authority of the holy Roman church of our
</p>
<p>lord the pope and his foresaid successors" be interpreted
</p>
<p>in the light of the principles and practice of the age in
</p>
<p>which the oath originated. All these the Romish bishops
</p>
<p>who reside in America are sworn to " preserve, defend, in-

<p>crease, and advance." Consider what is implied in " the
</p>
<p>APOSTOLIC DECREES, ordinances, or disposals, reservations,
</p>
<p>PERIOD OP GREGORY VII. 339
</p>
<p>provisions, or mandates." Does not this include the canon
</p>
<p>law, in which the temporal supremacy of the pope is car-
</p>
<p>ried to the highest point ? Does it not include the depos-
</p>
<p>ing power, the absolution from oaths, perfidy to heretics,
</p>
<p>the persecution of heretics, and other similar doctrines of
</p>
<p>the canon law ? But why ask this question as to the per-
</p>
<p>secution of heretics ? Does not the oath expressly demand
</p>
<p>the promise " to persecute and wage war with heretics,
</p>
<p>schismatics, and rebels to our said lord the pope to their
</p>
<p>utmost power " ? It is in vain to try to evade the import
</p>
<p>of this part of the oath, as does Bishop Kenrick, by say-
</p>
<p>ing that it denotes merely moral warfare by the truth.
</p>
<p>This is an evasion worthy only of a Jesuit. Was the
</p>
<p>duty of bishops towards heretics so understood in the age
</p>
<p>of Gregory, when the oath first originated ? Is it so un-
</p>
<p>derstood in the canon law which the bishop has sworn to
</p>
<p>observe ?
</p>
<p>Let it be noticed that this oath binds by its own force to
</p>
<p>obey the pope's decrees independently of a general council.
</p>
<p>It is an oath that in reality represents the views of THE
</p>
<p>ITALIAN PARTY ; that is, of the highest advocates of the
</p>
<p>Papal power. It is an oath framed by the head of the
</p>
<p>Roman court. Call to mind, now, the 'expressions of hatred,
</p>
<p>abhorrence, and utter detestation with which the popes even
</p>
<p>at this very time speak of the principles of religious liberty
</p>
<p>on which this nation is founded, and their steadfast purpose
</p>
<p>to oppose to their progress an iron will, and the conclusion
</p>
<p>is plain : either the bishops who take the oath are perjured,
</p>
<p>or else they do and will, to their utmost energy, cooperate
</p>
<p>with the pope to subvert our civil and religious liberty,
</p>
<p>and in place of them to establish the intolerant, persecut-
</p>
<p>ing, and bloody despotism of the pope. But perjury to
</p>
<p>himself the pope never allows. In his own behalf he
</p>
<p>sanctions and enjoins it ; but against himself it is an unpar-

<p>donable sin.
</p>
<p>340 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>Such, then, are the institutions of the canonized Gregory,
</p>
<p>whom our American bishops honor as a saint. We com-
</p>
<p>mend them to the careful consideration of American free-
</p>
<p>men.
</p>
<p>It was by the same Gregory also, although before his
</p>
<p>Papacy, that the present mode of electing the popes by
</p>
<p>cardinals was introduced. This was another important
</p>
<p>step in the work of securing the independency of the
</p>
<p>Papacy of all secular power, and it has contributed greatly
</p>
<p>to the strength and perpetuity of the whole Papal system.
</p>
<p>GREGORY'S IMPOSTURES.
</p>
<p>We have said that Gregory resorted to forgery and
</p>
<p>fraud in carrying out his purpose of making the monarchs
</p>
<p>of Europe his vassals. Of this we find a striking case in
</p>
<p>a pretended quotation of his from what he asserts to be a
</p>
<p>statute of the Emperor Charlemagne, declaring that France,
</p>
<p>as a feudatory of the holy see, was bound to pay an annual
</p>
<p>tribute called Peter's pence. He declared that this tribute
</p>
<p>was, by order of Charlemagne, collected yearly at Puy, in
</p>
<p>Velai, at Aix-la-Chapelle, and at St. Giles. This statute
</p>
<p>was lodged, as he says, in the archives of St. Peter's Church.
</p>
<p>This absurd pretence was in substance a second and
</p>
<p>revised edition of the old forgery of the donation of Con-
</p>
<p>stantine. Yet he insisted upon the tribute upon this
</p>
<p>ground.
</p>
<p>So he set up a claim that Spain originally belonged to
</p>
<p>Peter, and on this ground authorized Count Euvulus to
</p>
<p>conquer those parts of it occupied by the Moors in his
</p>
<p>name, and to hold them as a feudatory and tributary of
</p>
<p>St. Peter. He demanded tribute also of all the Christian

</p>
<p>kings of Spain on the same ground.
</p>
<p>PERIOD OP GREGORY VII. 341
</p>
<p>He claimed Hungary from King Solomon as a gift to
</p>
<p>Peter from Stephen, the first Christian king. Solomon re-
</p>
<p>sisted the demand on the ground of allegiance to the em-
</p>
<p>peror, but was driven from the throne by his cousin Geisa ;
</p>
<p>and on him Gregory conferred the kingdom on condition
</p>
<p>that he would be his vassal, and not that of the emperor.
</p>
<p>In like manner he laid claim to Corsica, Sardinia, Dalma-
</p>
<p>tia, Russia, Denmark, Poland, Saxony, and England, as fiefs
</p>
<p>of the apostle Peter. In Italy the Normans, masters
</p>
<p>of Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily, the Dukes of Benevento,
</p>
<p>Capua, and Aversa, and other princes, swore allegiance
</p>
<p>to Gregory, lest if they did not he should stir up other
</p>
<p>monarchs to invade them. A more barefaced system of
</p>
<p>imposition, fraud, and villany was never practised ; and
</p>
<p>yet it is only a consistent extension of the principles of
</p>
<p>the forged decretals. All of these proceedings were car-
</p>
<p>ried on by Gregory in a style of eminent Papal sanctity
</p>
<p>and authority. The details may be found in his letters and
</p>
<p>in Bower's Lives of the Popes. On these proceedings
</p>
<p>Hallam remarks, " It was convenient to treat this apostle
</p>
<p>as a great feudal suzerain; and the legal principles of that
</p>
<p>age were dexterously applied to rivet more forcibly the
</p>
<p>fetters of superstition."
</p>
<p>Such is the morality of St. Gregory VII., the patron
</p>
<p>saint of the Bishops of Rome who sojourn in these United
</p>
<p>States. But in all this he has but followed sainted popes
</p>
<p>of other ages. All the great architects of the Romish
</p>
<p>Babylon have been men of a kindred character. Bold,
</p>
<p>energetic, aspiring, intelligent, in ages of darkness they
</p>
<p>have, on principle and without scruple, resorted to the
</p>
<p>use of forgery and fraud to establish their usurped author-
</p>
<p>ity over a subjugated world.

<p>CHAPTER VII.
</p>
<p>CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DISPENSATION OF GREGORY VIL
</p>
<p>WE have traced the formation of the Romish corpora-
</p>
<p>tion to the time of its maturity and full development.
</p>
<p>' Let us now consider some of the characteristics of the
</p>
<p>age when it developed itself without impediment.
</p>
<p>First of all it follows from the necessity of the case
</p>
<p>that it must have been eminently a period of credulity.
</p>
<p>It was, of necessity, entirely devoid of the critical and
</p>
<p>historic spirit. To a great extent all men lived in an
</p>
<p>unnatural, mythical, dreamy world ; this was the inevita-
</p>
<p>ble result of that training to which the barbarous nations
</p>
<p>had been long subjected by means of that widespread sys-
</p>
<p>tem of pious fraud which has been described and the false
</p>
<p>system in which it resulted. The whole energy of the ec-
</p>
<p>clesiastics of "Western Europe was put forth to develop
</p>
<p>and cultivate habits of credulity as the basis of hierarchal
</p>
<p>power. The whole European mind was thus immersed
</p>
<p>into a lake of credulity, until it was thereby steeped and
</p>
<p>impregnated in all its faculties, and, even in its very es-
</p>
<p>sence, with credulity. Such were the ages sometimes mis-
</p>
<p>called the ages of faith.
</p>
<p>The consequence of this was, that the system introduced
</p>
<p>and established operated with immense, with inconceivable,
</p>
<p>power. Bungling as were the forged decretals, the dona-
</p>
<p>tion of Constantine, and other similar forgeries, yet, being

<p>fully believed, they exercised an equal power with the

</p>
<p>Nor is the existence of the scholastic divinity inconsist-
</p>
<p>ent with this statement. That was, no doubt, a powerful
</p>
<p>development of systematizing and of logic ; but the prem-
</p>
<p>ises were furnished by the hierarchy, and were to be

<p>received without dispute, on peril of anathemas and ex-
</p>
<p>communications. History and intelligent criticism had
</p>
<p>no place in their studies. Hence they did not detect or
</p>
<p>expose the forged decretals nor any of the frauds of other
</p>
<p>ages. They ground in the great mill of the Papacy like
</p>
<p>blinded Samson in the mill of the Philistines. Nay, more :
</p>
<p>they forged new shackles for humanity by developing and
</p>
<p>defending the peculiar doctrines of the Papacy, such as
</p>
<p>transubstantiation, purgatory, and the seven sacraments.
</p>
<p>It is a natural result from the preceding statements
</p>
<p>that this was an age of profound superstition. The world
</p>
<p>was darkened by false views of God and the unreal terrors
</p>
<p>of the Papacy. The excess of terror produced in the
</p>
<p>boldest minds by excommunication is to us inconceivable,
</p>
<p>and an interdict was the climax of horrors. An interdict
</p>
<p>was the suspension of all the ordinary offices of religion
</p>
<p>throughout a whole province, or kingdom, commonly for
</p>
<p>the sin of some ruler. It was designed by the pope to
</p>
<p>subdue the refractory spirit of such ruler by the terrors
</p>
<p>of his subjects. In the ages of the deepest credulity it
</p>
<p>was as if the sun was turned into darkness and the moon
</p>
<p>into blood as if the stars were falling from heaven and
</p>
<p>all the powers of heaven were shaken. By it God was
</p>
<p>eclipsed, heaven shut up, and hell opened. " The churches,"
</p>
<p>says Hallam, " were closed, the bells silent, the dead un-
</p>
<p>buried, no rite but those of baptism and extreme unction
</p>
<p>performed. The penalty fell upon those who had neither

</p>
<p>offence was often but a private dispute, in which the pride
</p>
<p>of a pope or bishop had been wounded. They were issued
</p>
<p>not unfrequently against kingdoms ; but in particular
</p>
<p>districts they continually occurred." With regard to the
</p>
<p>policy of Rome in issuing such interdicts Hallam justly
</p>
<p>remarks, " No stretch of her tyranny was, perhaps, so out-
</p>
<p>rageous as this."
</p>
<p>The terrors of excommunication, though commonly not
</p>
<p>so widespread, were equally vivid and overpowering.
</p>
<p>The church not only excluded from communion, but with
</p>
<p>all her power poured odium upon her victims. In the
</p>
<p>words of Hallam, " They were to be shunned like men in-
</p>
<p>fected with leprosy by their servants, their friends, and
</p>
<p>their families. Two attendants only (if we may trust a
</p>
<p>current history) remained with Robert, King of France,
</p>
<p>who, on account of an irregular marriage, was put to this
</p>
<p>ban by Gregory Y. ; and these threw all the meats that
</p>
<p>had passed his table into the fire. Indeed the mere inter-
</p>
<p>course with a proscribed person incurred what was called
</p>
<p>the lesser excommunication, or privation of the sacraments,
</p>
<p>and required penitence and absolution. In some places a
</p>
<p>bier was set before the door of an excommunicated indi-
</p>
<p>vidual and stones thrown at his windows a singular
</p>
<p>method of compelling his submission ! Every where the
</p>
<p>excommunicated were debarred of a regular sepulture,
</p>
<p>which, though obviously a matter of police, has, through
</p>
<p>the superstition of consecrating burial grounds, been
</p>
<p>treated as belonging to ecclesiastical control."
</p>
<p>In this age also there was an entire subversion of all
</p>
<p>moral principle in the constant effort of the pope and his
</p>
<p>corporation to exaggerate the guilt of heresy, that is, of
</p>
<p>resistance to their decisions and their authority, and to
</p>
<p>extirpate it by fire and sword. If any, repelled by the

</p>
<p>for a purer religion, it mattered not if they manifested
</p>
<p>every element of the Christian character. It was in vain
</p>
<p>that they were chaste, temperate, industrious, benevolent,
</p>
<p>compassionate, intelligent, and in all respects pure in
</p>
<p>heart and life : the one sin of heresy that is, resistance to
</p>
<p>the pope outweighed it all. On the other hand, fraud,
</p>
<p>perjury, lust, uncleanness, murder, violence, plunder were
</p>
<p>all transmuted into virtues by the popes, and rewarded
</p>
<p>with the pardon of sin and the promise of heaven if they
</p>
<p>were but employed for the church in the extermination of
</p>
<p>heretics. The whole history of the crusades against the
</p>
<p>Albigenses, of which Innocent III. was the life and soul,
</p>
<p>is full of illustrations of the truth of these remarks. Nor
</p>
<p>was it enough to torture and murder the pure and the in-
</p>
<p>nocent. Slander was added ; and those crimes of impurity
</p>
<p>which rendered the Romish clergy justly infamous were
</p>
<p>falsely imputed to their pure and innocent victims.
</p>
<p>So utterly had the church thus perverted the moral sense
</p>
<p>of the masses that they entered with rapturous joy on the
</p>
<p>work of massacre if heretics were to be the objects of
</p>
<p>assault. In these works of blood the popes were ever
</p>
<p>the mainspring, and ecclesiastics their mcrst infuriated in-
</p>
<p>struments. Moreover the whole bloody work was done
</p>
<p>under the forms of religion, and massacres the most atro-
</p>
<p>cious were celebrated by Te Deums.
</p>
<p>During the Papacy of Innocent III. the Romish system
</p>
<p>was at its highest point of development. He is the most
</p>
<p>perfect imbodiment of the system. And yet it was he
</p>
<p>who first fully and on a great scale incorporated into the
</p>
<p>fundamental law and practice of the church the principles
</p>
<p>of fraud, perjury, robbery, and murder in the extirpation
</p>
<p>of heretics.

</p>
<p>act out of that great drama of horrors. The army of
</p>
<p>brutal and fanatical crusaders whom Innocent had stirred
</p>
<p>up by indulgences and promises of heaven to the work of
</p>
<p>blood poured like a torrent into the province of Langue-
</p>
<p>doc, on the Gulf of Lyons. Here and in the adjacent
</p>
<p>province of Provence were the chief abodes of the Albi-
</p>
<p>genses. The crusaders assailed Beziers, a city containing
</p>
<p>about fifteen thousand inhabitants ; but as from the castles
</p>
<p>and villages around men, women, and children had fled to
</p>
<p>it, from forty to sixty thousand people were concentrated
</p>
<p>there. As soon as the crusaders took the place their vic-
</p>
<p>tims- crowded to the churches ; and, by way of supplication
</p>
<p>for mercy, the bells were tolled. In vain the churches
</p>
<p>were deluged with blood. In one alone seven thousand
</p>
<p>corpses were counted. All were slaughtered to the last
</p>
<p>living creature, the houses were plundered, and the city
</p>
<p>burned. Not a building remained not a human being
</p>
<p>was left alive. All this and other similar scenes of hor-
</p>
<p>ror Innocent stirred up the crusaders, by bulls, and briefs,
</p>
<p>and promises of reward, to undertake and execute ; and he
</p>
<p>sanctioned and applauded them when done. The com-
</p>
<p>munity of the Albigenses was the most civilized, intelli-
</p>
<p>gent, moral, religious, and refined in Europe. For this
</p>
<p>reason they saw the abominations of the Papacy and re-
</p>
<p>volted, adopting the true doctrines of the word of God.
</p>
<p>For this very reason, too, Innocent determined on their
</p>
<p>utter extermination ; and, as the slow processes of trial
</p>
<p>were too tardy in their operation, he determined to effect
</p>
<p>a summary extermination without trial ; and, as in the
</p>
<p>case of the Gunpowder Plot, the death of a few "Papists
</p>
<p>was not to be thought of when compared with ecclesias-
</p>
<p>tical utility. By such measures this first reformation was
</p>
<p>totally extinguished. So prodigious was the slaughter,

<p>BO freezing the terror, that the church, says Shoberl,
</p>
<p>DISPENSATION OF GREGORY Til. 347
</p>
<p>seemed completely to have gained her end. The worship
</p>
<p>of the reformed Albigenses ceased, their teachers were
</p>
<p>slain, and only a few scattered exiles remained. But
</p>
<p>even this did not satisfy Innocent. These, too, must be
</p>
<p>tracked and hunted out. For this purpose he established
</p>
<p>a body of inquisitors ; and, after some modifications, this
</p>
<p>arrangement resulted in the infamous and permanent tri-
</p>
<p>bunal of the Inquisition.
</p>
<p>The principles of perjury, treachery, robbery, and mur-
</p>
<p>der thus inaugurated by Innocent and sanctioned by the
</p>
<p>church, both by theory and example, descended as a lega-
</p>
<p>cy to the popes of other ages. They stimulated the hie-
</p>
<p>rarchy to the persecution of the Lollards, the disciples of
</p>
<p>Wickliffe in England, for about a century and a half;
</p>
<p>to the persecution and death of Jerom of Prague, John
</p>
<p>Huss, and their followers in Bohemia ; to the long-contin-
</p>
<p>ued and intensely cruel persecutions of the "Waldenses in
</p>
<p>northern Italy ; and finally to the extended leagues framed
</p>
<p>to slaughter and exterminate the Protestants of Europe
</p>
<p>after the reformation of Luther. Well does inspiration
</p>
<p>depict this abandoned and profligate body as a harlot
</p>
<p>drunk with the blood of the saints. Nor need we won-
</p>
<p>der that the highest indignation of God is manifested to-
</p>
<p>wards this unparalleled series of crimes. In view of the
</p>
<p>blood of saints found in her, the holy inhabitants of heav-
</p>
<p>en are called on to praise God for his avenging judg-
</p>
<p>ments on her ; and in view of such ineffable crimes they
</p>
<p>say hallelujah, whilst her smoke goes up forever and ever.

<p>the fact that the hostility of the Romish corporation to

<p>348 THE PAPAL CONSPIBACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>the Bible was first fully developed and that prohibitions
</p>
<p>were issued against its use in the vernacular tongues of
</p>
<p>Europe.
</p>
<p>The feelings of hostility to the popular reading of the
</p>
<p>Bible manifested by the Romish church at this day are
</p>
<p>well known. Can any thing be more striking than the
</p>
<p>fact that the great Romish saint, Gregory VII., took the
</p>
<p>lead in the enterprise of depriving the people of the Bi-
</p>
<p>ble ? In January, 1080, Yratislaus, Duke of Bohemia,
</p>
<p>desiring leave to have divine service performed in the com-
</p>
<p>mon tongue of the people, that is, the Sclavonian,
</p>
<p>Gregory gave him the following reply : " As you desire us
</p>
<p>to allow divine service to be performed among you in the
</p>
<p>Sclavonian tongue, know that I can by no means grant
</p>
<p>you your request, it being manifest to all who will but re-
</p>
<p>flect that it has pleased the Almighty that the Scripture
</p>
<p>should be withheld from some, and not understood by all,
</p>
<p>lest it should fall into contempt or lead the unlearned into
</p>
<p>error. And it must not be alleged that all were allowed
</p>
<p>in the primitive times to read the Scriptures, it being well
</p>
<p>known that in those early times the church connived at
</p>
<p>many things which the holy fathers disapproved and cor-
</p>
<p>rected when the Christian religion was firmly established.
</p>
<p>We therefore cannot grant, but absolutely forbid, by the
</p>
<p>authority of Almighty God and his blessed apostle Peter,
</p>
<p>what you ask, and command you to oppose to the utmost
</p>
<p>of your power all who require it.'' 7
</p>
<p>Thus did this pretended vicar of Christ repeal the com-
</p>
<p>mand of the great Head of the church, " Search the Scrip-
</p>
<p>tures," forbidding them even to be read in public divine
</p>
<p>worship in the vernacular tongue.

<p>DISPENSATION OP GREGORY VII. 349
</p>
<p>vigilance of Rome, however, early sought to guard against
</p>
<p>this source of danger. In 1229 the council of Toulouse
</p>
<p>passed a decree against the Waldenses and Albigenses.
</p>
<p>forbidding them to have the Bible translated into the vul-
</p>
<p>gar tongue. Similar prohibitions were issued in England.
</p>
<p>The aim of such prohibitions is twofold to defend
</p>
<p>the hierarchy from exposure ; and also to keep an absolute
</p>
<p>monopoly of scriptural truth in their own hands, so as to
</p>
<p>subject the people perfectly to their power.
</p>
<p>Against such prohibitions Wickliffe said to the pope,
</p>
<p>" A prohibition of reading the sacred Scriptures, and a
</p>
<p>vanity of secular dominion, would seem to partake too
</p>
<p>much of a disposition towards the BLASPHEMOUS ADVANCE-
</p>
<p>MENT OP ANTICHRIST." He then condemns the hatred of
</p>
<p>the Romish corporation to the gospel, their claims of in-
</p>
<p>fallibility, their crowding to Rome to obtain dispensations
</p>
<p>and to " PURCHASE A CONDEMNATION OF THE SACRED
</p>
<p>SCRIPTURES AS HERETICAL."
</p>
<p>In England the penalty for daring to read the Bible in
</p>
<p>the vernacular tongue was TO BE BURNED ALIVE. The in-
</p>
<p>quisitors and ecclesiastics carried on a persecution against
</p>
<p>the disciples of Wickliffe, for a century and a half on this
</p>
<p>ground, and many were burned alive. In 1519 seven per-
</p>
<p>sons were burned at Coventry, having been convicted of
</p>
<p>the crime of having the Scriptures in their possession, or
</p>
<p>portions of the same. Such scenes were extensively re-
</p>
<p>peated. All of the Bibles also were burned that could be
</p>
<p>obtained an example which Romish priests in this land
</p>
<p>are intent to follow.
</p>
<p>Thus was the first full development of the Papacy in the
</p>
<p>period of Gregory, the patron saint of American bishops,
</p>
<p>signalized by a systematic proscription of the word of
</p>
<p>God. In the ancient church such a course was unknown.

<p>All were exhorted to read and study the word of God.
</p>
<p>350 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>But, when the Romish corporation had completed their
</p>
<p>structure of forgery and fraud, it was fit and reasonable
</p>
<p>that they should regard the word of God in the hands
</p>
<p>of the people as their irreconcilable and unconquerable
</p>
<p>enemy, even as they do to this day.
</p>
<p>PECULIAR DOCTRINES OF POPERY.
</p>
<p>This introduces another remarkable characteristic of
</p>
<p>this period. It was the period in which the most power-
</p>
<p>ful and unscriptural peculiarities of Popery were fully
</p>
<p>developed, established by supreme authority, and consoli-
</p>
<p>dated into a system. It has been often stated that there
</p>
<p>were such peculiarities ; but the time of their incorporation
</p>
<p>as authorized parts of the system has not been distinctly
</p>
<p>considered. Is it not, then, a striking fact that these great
</p>
<p>peculiarities are not venerable for antiquity, but are the
</p>
<p>comparatively late products of the fifth class of popes ? It
</p>
<p>is also noteworthy that these last-established doctrines
</p>
<p>are the main sinews of the power and the sources of the
</p>
<p>profit of the Romish corporation. These peculiarities are
</p>
<p>the highest forms of the Papal supremacy the servitude of
</p>
<p>the bishops, the celibacy of the clergy, auricular confession,
</p>
<p>penances, purgatory, the seven sacraments, and especially
</p>
<p>transubstantiation and masses.
</p>
<p>It is not denied of course that the celibacy of the clergy
</p>
<p>existed before this age. But it was fast going into dis-
</p>
<p>use when Gregory arose ; and he and his successors en-
</p>
<p>forced it as never before.
</p>
<p>Of the Papal supremacy and the subjugation of the
</p>
<p>bishops enough has been said. Nor is it necessary to add
</p>
<p>any thing on the subject of the confessional, whicli is a

<p>product of this period.
</p>
<p>DISPENSATION OP GREGORY VII. 351
</p>
<p>The immense utility of the doctrine concerning purga-
</p>
<p>tory as a source of income to the priests has also been set
</p>
<p>forth. This doctrine also was established during this
</p>
<p>period.
</p>
<p>The doctrine of seven sacraments was also first fully
</p>
<p>developed and established in this age. The doctrine of
</p>
<p>transubstantiation and of masses which has ever since
</p>
<p>been a prime source of priestly power and an inexhausti-
</p>
<p>ble mine of wealth, deserves particular notice under this
</p>
<p>head.
</p>
<p>The profound learning and the unquestionable candor
</p>
<p>of Ranke will give great weight to the following tes-
</p>
<p>timony on these points from his History of the Refor-
</p>
<p>mation :
</p>
<p>" The question, at what periods and under what circum-
</p>
<p>stances the distinguishing doctrines and practices of the
</p>
<p>Romish church were settled and acquired an ascendency,
</p>
<p>merits a minute and elaborate dissertation.
</p>
<p>" It is sufficient here to recall to the mind of the reader
</p>
<p>that this took place at a comparatively late period and pre-
</p>
<p>cisely in the century of the great hierarchical struggles.
</p>
<p>"It is well known that the institutions of the seven
</p>
<p>sacraments, whose circle embraces all the important events
</p>
<p>of the life of man and brings them into contact with the
</p>
<p>church, is ascribed to Peter Lombard, who lived in the
</p>
<p>twelfth century. It appears upon inquiry that the notions
</p>
<p>regarding the most important of them, the sacrament of
</p>
<p>the altar, were by no means very distinct in the church
</p>
<p>itself in the time of that great theologian. It is true that
</p>
<p>one of those synods which, under Gregory VII., had con-
</p>
<p>tributed so much to the establishment of the hierarchy,
</p>
<p>had added great weight to the doctrine of the real pres-
</p>
<p>ence by the condemnation of Berengar ; but Peter Lom-
</p>
<p>bard as yet did not venture to decide in its favor. The

</p>
<p>word transubstantiation first became current in his time ;
</p>
<p>nor was it until the beginning of the thirteenth century
</p>
<p>that the idea and the word received the sanction of the
</p>
<p>352 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>church. This, as is well known, was first given by the
</p>
<p>Lateran confession of faith in the year 1215 ; and it was
</p>
<p>hot till later that the objections which till then had been
</p>
<p>constantly suggested by a deeper view of religion gradu-
</p>
<p>ally disappeared.
</p>
<p>" It is obvious, however, of what infinite importance
</p>
<p>this doctrine became to the service of the church, which
</p>
<p>has crystallized (if I may use the expression) around the
</p>
<p>mystery it involves. The ideas of the mystical and sen-
</p>
<p>sible presence of Christ in the church were thus imbodied
</p>
<p>in a living image ; the adoration of the host was intro-
</p>
<p>duced ; festivals in honor of this greatest of all miracles,
</p>
<p>incessantly repeated, were solemnized. Intimately con-
</p>
<p>nected with this is the great importance attached to the
</p>
<p>worship of the Virgin Mary, the mother of Christ, in the
</p>
<p>latter part of the middle ages.
</p>
<p>" The prerogatives of the priesthood are also essen-
</p>
<p>tially connected with this article of faith. The theory
</p>
<p>and doctrine of the priestly character were developed ;
</p>
<p>that is, of the power communicated to the priest by ordi-
</p>
<p>nation ' to make the body of Christ ' (as they did not
</p>
<p>scruple to say) ' to act in the person of Christ.' It is a
</p>
<p>product of the thirteenth century ; and it is to be traced
</p>
<p>principally to Alexander of Hales and Thomas Aquinas.
</p>
<p>This doctrine first gave to the separation of the priest-
</p>
<p>hood from the laity, which had indeed other and deeper
</p>
<p>causes, its full significancy. People began to see in the
</p>
<p>priest the mediator between God and man.
</p>
<p>" This separation, regarded as a positive institution, is
</p>
<p>also, as is well known, an offspring of the same epoch.
</p>
<p>In the thirteenth century, spite of all opposition, the

<p>rist in both kinds was more complete ; but it was said
</p>
<p>that the more worthy should be reserved for the more
</p>
<p>worthy for those by whose instrumentality alone it was
</p>
<p>produced. ' It is not in the participation of the faithful/
</p>
<p>says St. Thomas, ' that the perfection of the sacrament
</p>
<p>lies, but solely in the consecration of the elements. 7 And

<p>in fact the church appeared far less designed for instruc-

<p>tion or for the preaching of the gospel than for the show-
</p>
<p>ing forth of the great mystery ; and the priesthood is,
</p>
<p>through the sacrament, the sole depositary of the power
</p>
<p>to do this. It is through the priest that sanctification is
</p>
<p>imparted to the multitude.
</p>
<p>" This very separation of the priesthood from the laity
</p>
<p>gave its members boundless influence over all other classes
</p>
<p>of the community.
</p>
<p>" It is a necessary part of the theory of the sacerdotal
</p>
<p>character above alluded to that the priest has the exclu-
</p>
<p>sive power of removing the obstacles which stand in the
</p>
<p>way of a participation in the mysterious grace of God :
</p>
<p>in this not even a saint had power to supersede him.
</p>
<p>But the absolution which he is authorized to grant is
</p>
<p>charged with certain conditions, the most imperative of
</p>
<p>which is confession. In the beginning of the thirteenth
</p>
<p>century it was peremptorily enjoined on every believer
</p>
<p>as a duty to confess all his sins, at least once in a year,
</p>
<p>to some particular priest.
</p>
<p>"It requires no elaborate argument to prove what
</p>
<p>an all-pervading influence auricular confession and the
</p>
<p>official supervision and guidance of consciences must give
</p>
<p>to the clergy. With this was connected a complete, or-
</p>
<p>ganized system of penances.
</p>
<p>" Above all, a character and position almost divine
</p>
<p>was thus conferred on the high priest, the Pope of Rome ;
</p>
<p>of whom it was assumed that he occupied the place of
</p>
<p>Christ in the mystical body of the church, which em-
</p>
<p>braced heaven and earth, the dead and the living. This
</p>
<p>conception of the functions and attributes of the pope
</p>
<p>was first filled out and perfected in the beginning of the
</p>
<p>thirteenth century. Then, too, was the doctrine of the
</p>
<p>treasures of the church, on which the system of indul-
</p>
<p>gences rests, first promulgated. Innocent III. did not

<p>scruple to declare that what he did God did through
</p>
<p>him. Glossators added that the pope possessed the un-
</p>
<p>controlled will of God ; that his sentence superseded all
</p>
<p>reasons. With perverse and extravagant dialectics, they
</p>
<p>propounded the question, whether it were possible to ap-
</p>
<p>peal from the pope to God, and answered it in the nega-
</p>
<p>tive ; seeing that God had the same tribunal as the

<p>pope, and that it was impossible to appeal from any
</p>
<p>being to himself.
</p>
<p>" It is clear that the Papacy must have already gained
</p>
<p>the victory over the empire that it could no longer
</p>
<p>have any thing to fear either from master or rival'
</p>
<p>before opinions and doctrines of this kind could be en-
</p>
<p>tertained or avowed. In the age of struggles and con-
</p>
<p>quests, the theory of the hierarchy gained ground step
</p>
<p>by step with the fact of material power. Never were
</p>
<p>theory and practice more intimately connected.
</p>
<p>"Nor was it to be believed that any interruption or
</p>
<p>pause in this course of things took place in the fifteenth
</p>
<p>century. The denial of the right of the clergy to with-
</p>
<p>hold the cup was first declared to be heresy at the coun-
</p>
<p>cil of Constance. Eugenius IV. first formally accepted
</p>
<p>the doctrine of the seven sacraments. The extraordinary
</p>
<p>school interpretation of the miraculous conception was^
</p>
<p>first approved by the councils, favored by the popes, and
</p>
<p>accepted by the universities in this age.
</p>
<p>" It might appear that the worldly dispositions of the
</p>
<p>popes of those times, whose main object it was to enjoy
</p>
<p>life, to promote their dependants, and to enlarge their
</p>
<p>secular dominions, would have prejudiced their spiritual
</p>
<p>pretensions.. But, on the contrary, these were as vast
</p>
<p>and arrogant as ever. The only effect of the respect in-
</p>
<p>spired by the councils was, that the popes forbade any
</p>
<p>one to appeal to a council under pain of damnation.
</p>
<p>With what ardor do the curialist writers labor to demon-
</p>
<p>strate the infallibility of the pope ! John of Torquema-
</p>
<p>da is unwearied in heaping together analogies from Scrip-
</p>
<p>ture, maxims of the fathers, and passages out of the false
</p>
<p>decretals for this end. He goes so far as to maintain that,
</p>
<p>were there not a head of the church who could decide all
</p>
<p>controversies and remove all doubts, it might be possible

<p>to doubt of the Holy Scriptures themselves, which de-
</p>
<p>rived their authority only from the church ; which, again,
</p>
<p>could not be conceived as existing without the pope. In
</p>
<p>the beginning of the sixteenth century, the well-known
</p>
<p>Dominican, Thomas of Gaeta, did not hesitate to declare
</p>
<p>the church a born slave, who could have no other remedy
</p>
<p>against a bad pope than to pray for him without ceasing."
</p>
<p>DISPENSATION OF GREGORY VII. 355
</p>
<p>PECUNIARY EXTORTIONS.
</p>
<p>In this age also -was developed a system of pecuniary
</p>
<p>extortions that it is hard either to imagine or believe
</p>
<p>until we study the most authentic records of the age.
</p>
<p>To understand its extent, we must divide these exac-
</p>
<p>tions into two classes those needed to sustain the ex-
</p>
<p>travagance of the Roman court and to execute their vast
</p>
<p>plans for governing the world ; and those that were de-
</p>
<p>signed to support and enrich the secular clergy and the
</p>
<p>various monastic orders in each particular nation.
</p>
<p>Gregory's demand of tribute in the form of Peter's
</p>
<p>pence comes into the first class ; and in this way im-
</p>
<p>mense sums were raised. The pope also managed to de-
</p>
<p>rive an immense income from a trade in bishoprics and
</p>
<p>livings. A small degree of this traffic aroused the tender
</p>
<p>conscience of Gregory to depose Henry ; but by the popes
</p>
<p>it was practised without modesty or limitation. They
</p>
<p>contrived also to obtain immense profits for their favor-
</p>
<p>ites and tools at Rome by setting up claims to the right
</p>
<p>to interfere, not only in the election of bishops, but also
</p>
<p>in the conferment of benefices in the various dioceses of
</p>
<p>all Europe. The power of the patronage of the Presi-
</p>
<p>dent of the United States can give but a faint idea of the
</p>
<p>power of patronage thus wielded by the pope. Take
</p>
<p>one single example from the history of England, our
</p>
<p>motherland. In the thirteenth century, Gregory IX.,
</p>
<p>the great systematizer of the canon law, filled all the
</p>
<p>best benefices in England with his Italian priests. It
</p>
<p>was alleged, as Hallam states, in a remonstrance in the
</p>
<p>name of the whole nation, that they drew from England,

<p>in the middle of the thirteenth century, sixty or seventy

<p>thousand marks a year a sum far exceeding the royal

<p>356 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>revenues. A similar state of things existed. in France
</p>
<p>and Germany. These Italian favorites were allowed to
</p>
<p>employ curates, and, as non-residents, to live in luxury
</p>
<p>and ease. Some of them were thus enabled to hold from
</p>
<p>the pope fifty or sixty preferments.
</p>
<p>The popes also at length imposed a tax on the national
</p>
<p>clergy ; and then the rapacity of Papal exactions was with-
</p>
<p>out bounds. Hallam states that " the usurers of Cahora
</p>
<p>and Lombardy residing in London took up the trade of
</p>
<p>agency for the pope ; and in a few years he is said through
</p>
<p>them, partly by levies of money, partly by the revenues
</p>
<p>of benefices, to have plundered the kingdom of nine hun-
</p>
<p>dred and fifty thousand marks a sum equivalent to not
</p>
<p>less than fifteen millions sterling at present."
</p>
<p>Immense amounts were also extorted from all newly-
</p>
<p>appointed bishops for the conferment of the pallium, or
</p>
<p>bishop's cloak. The cost of a pallium for Mainz in Ger-
</p>
<p>many was twenty thousand gulden, assessed on the sev-
</p>
<p>eral parts of the see. Three hundred thousand gulden,
</p>
<p>it was calculated, were thus yearly absorbed from Ger-
</p>
<p>many by Rome.
</p>
<p>In view of such exactions of all kinds, Edward III. ad-
</p>
<p>dressed a strong remonstrance to Clement VI., declaring
</p>
<p>that they were intolerable and must be remedied. But it
</p>
<p>was of no avail. Shoberl states that in 1376 the commons
</p>
<p>in Parliament presented to the king an urgent remon-
</p>
<p>strance, affirming, what seems almost incredible, that " the
</p>
<p>taxes paid to the pope yearly amounted to five times as
</p>
<p>much as the taxes paid to the king."
</p>
<p>On this point F. Shoberl says,
</p>
<p>" The rapacity of the 'popes, who, as we have seen,
</p>
<p>claimed the right of nominating to all benefices and
</p>
<p>made the exercise of it a source of prodigious wealth,
</p>

<p>land only, but throughout all Christendom. By such
</p>
<p>DISPENSATION OF GREGORY VII. 357
</p>
<p>means Pope John XXII. was enabled to leave at his
</p>
<p>death twenty-two millions of florins in his coffers. ' This
</p>
<p>prodigious treasure/ says Fleury, 'was amassed by the
</p>
<p>industry of his holiness, who reserved for himself the
</p>
<p>reversion of the benefices of all the collegiate churches
</p>
<p>in Christendom, alleging that he did so to prevent
</p>
<p>simony. Moreover by virtue of this reservation he never
</p>
<p>directly confirmed the election of any prelate, but pro-
</p>
<p>moted a bishop to an archbishopric, and put an inferior
</p>
<p>bishop in his place : hence it frequently happened that
</p>
<p>the vacancy of an archbishopric or a patriarchate occa-
</p>
<p>sioned six promotions or more, producing large sums of
</p>
<p>money to the apostolic chamber.'
</p>
<p>" When Innocent VI. sent Philip de Cabassole to Ger-
</p>
<p>many to levy the tenth of all the ecclesiastical revenues,
</p>
<p>the prelates of that country loudly complained of this new
</p>
<p>exaction. ' The Romans,' said one of them, exhorting his
</p>
<p>brethren to oppose it, ' have always looked upon Germany
</p>
<p>as a gold mine, and invented divers means of exhausting
</p>
<p>it. What doth the pope give to this kingdom but letters
</p>
<p>and words ? Let him dispose of all benefices as far as
</p>
<p>the collation goes ; but let him leave the revenues to
</p>
<p>those who perform the duties. We send money enough to
</p>
<p>Italy for divers merchandises, and to Avignon, [where the
</p>
<p>Papal court was then residing,] for our sons who are
</p>
<p>studying there or soliciting, we will not say buying, bene-
</p>
<p>fices. All of you well know that large sums of money are
</p>
<p>every year carried from Germany to the court of the pope
</p>
<p>for the confirmation of prelates, for the grant of benefices,
</p>
<p>for the prosecution of suits and appeals to tJie holy see, for
</p>
<p>dispensations, absolutions, indulgences, privileges, and other fa-
</p>
<p>vors. In all times the archbishops confirmed the elec-
</p>
<p>tions of the bishops, their suffragans. It was Pope John
</p>
<p>XXII. who in our time wrested this right from them' by

<p>violence. And now the pope is again demanding from
</p>
<p>the clergy a new and unheard-of subsidy, threatening with
</p>
<p>censures such as will not give it or as shall oppose it.
</p>
<p>Stop the beginning of the evil, and suffer not this dis-
</p>
<p>graceful servitude to be established.' "
</p>
<p>It appears from this statement that Papal ingenuity
</p>
<p>358 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>exhausted itself in devising various modes of obtaining
</p>
<p>money. Who does not understand the immense trade
</p>
<p>in indulgences carried on by them and their agents in
</p>
<p>all Europe ?
</p>
<p>So, too, dispensations from impediments to marriage
</p>
<p>were a constant source of revenue. To this must be
</p>
<p>added pilgrimages, jubilees, and other ingenious modes
</p>
<p>of deluding the people and filling the pope's coffers with
</p>
<p>their hard-earned wages.
</p>
<p>Besides all this, immense sums were obtained by the
</p>
<p>mendicant friars that all-pervading Papal army. From
</p>
<p>Germany, for example, shortly before the reformation,
</p>
<p>they collected, according to Kanke, a yearly revenue of
</p>
<p>one million gulden.
</p>
<p>It must be borne in mind also that the secular clergy
</p>
<p>as well as the monasteries drew largely on the resources
</p>
<p>of the people. The monasteries and regular clergy held
</p>
<p>about one half of the land of Europe, and besides, by the
</p>
<p>various kinds of spiritual traffic already described, ab-
</p>
<p>sorbed the earnings of the people.
</p>
<p>I do not affirm that by the locusts who, under their
</p>
<p>leader Apollyon, issued from the smoke of the bottomless
</p>
<p>pit to prey upon men and to torment them God meant to
</p>
<p>describe the Romish corporation, and monks, and clergy,
</p>
<p>under their leader the pope. But, however this may be,
</p>
<p>one thing is plain no symbol can better describe them
</p>
<p>and their deeds. One long, loud, universal cry went up
</p>
<p>throughout Europe, alike from kings, nobles, and people,
</p>
<p>of the rapacious and plundering spirit of Rome and her
</p>
<p>myrmidons. None but those who experienced it can ever
</p>
<p>conceive how great was the plague. The language of the
</p>
<p>times labors in vain to express it. Even imagination
</p>
<p>fails and is powerless.

<p>Such is one of the most remarkable aspects of this

<p>period a period well deserving the study of Americans.

<p>PAPAL MORALITY.
</p>
<p>As the main claim of the Papal corporation is, that it
</p>
<p>is the only true and holy church, and the only author of
</p>
<p>holiness, we ought to find in this age of its supremacy
</p>
<p>abundant evidence of the truth of such claims. It is
</p>
<p>needless to say that we shall seek for them in vain. On
</p>
<p>the other hand, in this age a degree of moral corruption
</p>
<p>was developed in the Roman court and in the community
</p>
<p>the depths of which it is almost impossible to fathom and
</p>
<p>the atrocity of which is beyond description.
</p>
<p>The celibacy of the clergy, as has been shown, in this pe-
</p>
<p>riod had thoroughly debauched the whole European world.
</p>
<p>The selfish, treacherous, and rapacious policy of the Papal
</p>
<p>court at length utterly corrupted the policy of kings.
</p>
<p>Machiavelli, in his Prince, did but apply to the state the
</p>
<p>Papal principles as to ecclesiastical expediency. Kings,
</p>
<p>following Papal maxims, justified and employed perjury,
</p>
<p>perfidy, poisoning, and secret murder for state ends. Of
</p>
<p>all these things the court of Rome had furnished abundant
</p>
<p>examples. It seemed to be God's purpose to develop the
</p>
<p>true tendency of the maxims of the Papal court in the
</p>
<p>atrocious life and death of Alexander YI. Sismondi de-
</p>
<p>clares that by reason of such extreme corruption " the six-
</p>
<p>teenth century was marked by an entire abandonment of
</p>
<p>all morals, honor, and virtue." Steinmetz, in his history
</p>
<p>of the Jesuits, says, " In Italy, amidst its splendor of arts

</p>
<p>rupted that public shame is utterly lost ; the vices of
</p>
<p>individuals even the most remarkable for their riches,
</p>
<p>rank, and position exhibit a front of brass in the boastful
</p>
<p>impudence of guilt. Nothing is concealed nothing dis-
</p>
<p>graces." " It seems as if men look on crime as their
</p>
<p>meals with an appetite or not, as the case may be ; but
</p>
<p>all is natural ; children grow up like their parents born
</p>
<p>in the midst of wickedness, how can they be otherwise ? "
</p>
<p>Of the religion producing such results he says, " It was
</p>
<p>not Christianity, but a timeserving, political, sensual, las-
</p>
<p>civious, avaricious system formed by the passions and in-
</p>
<p>tellect of men."
</p>
<p>In a review of the life and works of Machiavelli, Ma-
</p>
<p>caulay thus speaks of his most famous work :
</p>
<p>" It is indeed scarcely possible for any person not well
</p>
<p>acquainted with the history and literature of Italy to read
</p>
<p>without horror and amazement the celebrated treatise
</p>
<p>which has brought so much obloquy on the name of
</p>
<p>Machiavelli. Such a display of wickedness, naked, yet
</p>
<p>not ashamed, such cool, judicious, scientific atrocity,
</p>
<p>seem rather to belong to a fiend than to the most de-
</p>
<p>praved of men. Principles which the most hardened ruf-
</p>
<p>fian would scarcely hint to his most trusted accomplice, or
</p>
<p>avow, without the disguise of some palliating sophism, even
</p>
<p>to his own mind, are professed without the slightest cir-
</p>
<p>cumlocution, and assumed as the fundamental axioms of
</p>
<p>all political science."
</p>
<p>After trying and rejecting various modes of accounting
</p>
<p>for such a moral phenomenon, he comes to the conclusion
</p>
<p>that Machiavelli was a kind, well-meaning man, but that
</p>
<p>the morals of Italy had been so debased by the Papacy that
</p>
<p>neither he nor any one around him had any idea that
</p>
<p>there was any thing wrong or immoral in his book. He

</p>
<p>" There is no reason whatever to think that those
</p>
<p>amongst whom he lived saw any thing shocking or in-
</p>
<p>congruous in his writings. Abundant proofs remain of
</p>
<p>the high estimation in which both his works and his per-
</p>
<p>son were held by the most respectable among his contem-
</p>
<p>poraries. Clement VII. patronized the publication of
</p>
<p>those very books which the council of Trent in the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing generation pronounced unfit for the perusal of
</p>
<p>Christians. Some members of the democratical party
</p>
<p>censured the secretary for dedicating the Prince to a pa-
</p>
<p>tron who bore the unpopular name of Medici ; but to those
</p>
<p>immoral doctrines which have since called forth such se-
</p>
<p>vere reprehensions no exception appears to have been
</p>
<p>taken. The cry against them was first raised beyond the
</p>
<p>Alps, and seems to have been heard with amazement in
</p>
<p>Italy. The earliest assailant, as far as we are aware, was
</p>
<p>a countryman of our own, Cardinal Pole. The author of
</p>
<p>the Anti-Machiavelli was a French Protestant."
</p>
<p>This is what the mother of harlots and of abominations
</p>
<p>effected for Italy and Rome. Let us now see what she
</p>
<p>did for France and Avignon during the seventy years' res-
</p>
<p>idence of the Papacy there after Boniface VIII. Wick-
</p>
<p>liffe was sent on a mission to the Papal court to secure the
</p>
<p>correction of abuses in England. The mission was vain ;
</p>
<p>but not so his opportunities of observation. It affected
</p>
<p>him as Rome at a later day did Luther. Shoberl says,
</p>
<p>" If no immediate result was obtained by this mission,
</p>
<p>still the opportunities which it afforded Wickliffe for ob-
</p>
<p>servation convinced him that the system of the Papal
</p>
<p>court and its doctrines were equally corrupt. These con-
</p>
<p>victions he did not fail to express on his return in the
</p>
<p>boldest manner. He insisted that the Scriptures contain
</p>

</p>
<p>God, showing himself that he is God,' and denounced him
</p>
<p>as Antichrist. These doctrines Wickliffe openly taught
</p>
<p>and maintained ; and well he might, for at this period the
</p>
<p>popes themselves, their court, and the clergy in general,
</p>
<p>pampered by the wealth which their rapacious arts were
</p>
<p>incessantly supplying, exhibited a corruption of morals, a
</p>
<p>depravity, a licentiousness scarcely to be conceived, much
</p>
<p>less described. In assuming the sacerdotal office they
</p>
<p>seemed to have vowed utterly to discard all that man-
</p>
<p>kind had been accustomed to call virtue. It is impossi-
</p>
<p>ble to read without profound horror the description given
</p>
<p>by Petrarch, himself a churchman, of the dissoluteness of
</p>
<p>the Papal court in the fourteenth century while resident
</p>
<p>at Avignon ; and all contemporary accounts prove that he
</p>
<p>is not chargeable with having recurred in his picture to
</p>
<p>the poet's license. ' You imagine/ he writes in a letter
</p>
<p>to a friend, ' that the city of Avignon is the same now that
</p>
<p>it was when you resided in it. No ; it is very different.
</p>
<p>It was then, it is true, the worst and vilest place on earth ;
</p>
<p>now it is become a terrestrial hell, an abode of fiends and
</p>
<p>devils, a receptacle of all that is most wicked and abom-
</p>
<p>inable. What I tell you is not from hearsay, but from my
</p>
<p>own knowledge and experience. In this city there is no
</p>
<p>piety, no reverence or fear of God, no faith or charity ;
</p>
<p>nothing that is holy, just, equitable, or humane. Why
</p>
<p>should I speak of truth, where not only the houses, palaces,
</p>
<p>courts, churches, and the thrones of popes and cardinals,
</p>
<p>but the very earth and air seem to teem with lies ? A fu-
</p>
<p>ture state, heaven, hell, and judgment are openly turned
</p>
<p>into ridicule as childish fables. Good men have of late
</p>
<p>been treated with so much scorn and contempt that there
</p>
<p>is not one left among them to be an object of laughter.'
</p>
<p>In the same letter he declares that the more profligate a
</p>
<p>man was, the more certain he was of preferment in the

<p>church.
</p>
<p>" It is no wonder that, amidst so deep a corruption of
</p>
<p>manners in those whose lives should be patterns to the
</p>
<p>other classes of society, the vices of the clergy were
</p>
<p>standing subjects of satire in every country of Europe,
</p>
<p>and especially England, in the fourteenth century. The
</p>
<p>poems of Chaucer abound in passages of this kind ; and
</p>
<p>DISPENSATION OP GREGORY VII. 363
</p>
<p>the Ploughman's Tale is one continued satire upon the
</p>
<p>clergy for their gross ignorance, cruelty, covetousuess,
</p>
<p>simony, vanity, pride, ambition, drunkenness, gluttony,
</p>
<p>lechery, and other vices. This profligacy gave rise to an
</p>
<p>opinion, which universally prevailed, that the coming of
</p>
<p>Antichrist was at hand. We are told indeed that, in 1364,
</p>
<p>Dr. Nicholas Orem, a celebrated preacher, in a sermon be-
</p>
<p>fore the pope and cardinals, undertook to demonstrate this
</p>
<p>proposition from the enormous corruption and the intol-
</p>
<p>erable abuses of the church. Even Petrarch, though not
</p>
<p>scrupulous in regard to doctrines and ceremonies, was so
</p>
<p>shocked at the gross depravity of the Papal court that he
</p>
<p>applied that passage in the book of Revelation concern-
</p>
<p>ing Babylon, the mother of harlots and of all abomina-
</p>
<p>tions, to the city of Avignon, where, as it has been
</p>
<p>observed, the pope then resided."
</p>
<p>It is not until we understand such a state of shameless
</p>
<p>moral debasement that we can regard as credible what is
</p>
<p>nevertheless a fact, that, at the close of the council of Ly-
</p>
<p>ons, Cardinal Hugo dared to utter to the citizens, as a
</p>
<p>brazen joke, the following address, descriptive of a fact :
</p>
<p>" My friends, we have conferred on this place a great ben-
</p>
<p>efit. When we came here there was a number of houses
</p>
<p>of ill fame ; but now there is but one ; but that one ex-
</p>
<p>tends from the eastern to the western gate of the city."
</p>
<p>The infidelity that reigned at Avignon no less devel-
</p>
<p>oped itself at Rome. On this subject Macaulay says,
</p>
<p>" During the generation which preceded the reforma-
</p>
<p>tion that court had been a scandal to the Christian name.
</p>
<p>Its annals are black with treason, murder, and incest.
</p>
<p>Even its more respectable members were utterly unfit to
</p>
<p>be ministers of religion. They were men like Leo ' X. ;
</p>
<p>men who, with the Latinity of the Augustan age, had ac-
</p>
<p>quired its atheistical and scoffing spirit. They regarded

<p>these Christian mysteries of- which they were stewards
</p>
<p>just as the Augur Cicero and the Pontifex Maximus Cae-
</p>
<p>sar regarded the Sibylline books and the pecking of the

</p>
<p>sacred chicken?. Among themselves they spoke of the
</p>
<p>incarnation, the eucharist, and the Trinity in the same
</p>
<p>tone in which Cotta and Yelleius talked of the oracle
</p>
<p>of Delphi or of the voice of Faunus in the mountains.
</p>
<p>Their years glided by in a soft dream of sensual and intel-
</p>
<p>lectual voluptuousness. Choice cookery, delicious wines,
</p>
<p>lovely women, hounds, falcons, horses, newly-discovered
</p>
<p>manuscripts of the classics, sonnets and burlesque ro-

<p>mances in the sweetest Tuscan, just as licentious as a

<p>dug up from among the ruins of ancient temples and vil-
</p>
<p>las, these things were the delight and even the serious

<p>business of their lives."
</p>
<p>Such was the ineffable malignity of the influence of the

<p>Roman corporation, falsely called a church, when in its

<p>THE JUDGMENT OF GOD AND THE BUBNING

<p>OF BABYLON.
</p>
<p>CHAPTER I.
</p>
<p>BABYLON ON FIRE.
</p>
<p>ON the morning of the 10th day of December, 1520,
</p>
<p>the inhabitants of Wittemberg, in Germany, were aroused
</p>
<p>and filled with amazement by the breaking out of a great
</p>
<p>conflagration at the east gate of the city. The intelli-
</p>
<p>gence of this conflagration at once spread as on the wings
</p>
<p>of the wind, and wherever it came it no less aroused and
</p>
<p>amazed the world. It was but the emblem of a greater
</p>
<p>conflagration which had then broken out, and which has
</p>
<p>continued to burn to this day, and which is destined still
</p>
<p>to burn with fiercer flames until Babylon the great is ut-
</p>
<p>terly burned with fire by the avenging judgment of her
</p>
<p>almighty Judge. From that day to this intense efforts
</p>
<p>have been made to extinguish the mighty conflagration.
</p>
<p>The great fire company of the Jesuits was formed for this
</p>
<p>especial end, and have labored manfully, but in vain. It

</p>
<p>still burns, and will burn till the avenging judgment of
</p>
<p>God is completed.
</p>
<p>Not least of all does the conflagration rage in this land.
</p>
<p>The very fundamental principles of our civil and religious
</p>
<p>institutions are devouring fire to the great Babylon ; for
</p>
<p>which reason earnest efforts are now made to quench their
</p>
<p>fiery energy. But all shall be in vain.
</p>
<p>But let us draw near and consider the burning in Wit-
</p>
<p>temberg. Of it we find the following authentic account :
</p>
<p>"This 10th day of December, in the year 1520, at the
</p>
<p>ninth hour of the day, were burned at Wittemberg, at
</p>
<p>the east gate, near the Holy Cross, ALL THE POPE'S BOOKS,
</p>
<p>the Decree, the Decretgls, the Extravagante of Clement VI.,
</p>
<p>Leo X.'s last bull, the JJngelic Sum, Eck's Chrysoprasus,
</p>
<p>and some other works of Eck's and Emser's. Is not this
</p>
<p>new?"
</p>
<p>What was this last bull of Leo X. ? It was the bull of
</p>
<p>excommunication of one Martin Luther. What had he
</p>
<p>done ? He had in the year 1517 seriously interfered with
</p>
<p>the trading operations of the great corporation in the sale
</p>
<p>of indulgences for the professed purpose of building St.
</p>
<p>Peter's Church at Rome. When called to account, he had
</p>
<p>refused to retract what he had said. When called on to
</p>
<p>dispute, he had refused to be beaten in an argument.
</p>
<p>When the authority of the pope was quoted against him,
</p>
<p>he had dared to call in question that authority, as of mod-
</p>
<p>ern origin. When the forged decretals were quoted against
</p>
<p>him, though at first silenced, not knowing them to be forged)
</p>
<p>he at last discovered the imposture, and dared to denounce
</p>
<p>the pope and his forgeries. When pressed by the authority
</p>
<p>of councils, he dared to declare that councils were not
</p>
<p>infallible, and had erred, and that the Bible alone was in-
</p>
<p>fallible. He had dared, moreover, to appeal to the Ger-

</p>
<p>man princes to arouse themselves and resist the usurpa-
</p>
<p>BABYLON OX FIRE. 367
</p>
<p>tions and aggressions of the pope. He had dared to assail
</p>
<p>the celibacy of the clergy, and the pope's temporal as well
</p>
<p>as his spiritual monarchy, and to demand that all things
</p>
<p>should be reduced to order according to the word of God
</p>
<p>and the testimony of history.
</p>
<p>This, in brief, was what Martin Luther had done ; and
</p>
<p>in truth it would seem to have been enough, if there were
</p>
<p>any virtue in bulls, to call for one of the most roaring
</p>
<p>kind and the most terrific energy. Accordingly it came ;
</p>
<p>and we have seen its reception by Luther, and its doom.
</p>
<p>But the burning of the bull was not the most significant
</p>
<p>part of the proceedings. "With it were burned the forged
</p>
<p>decretals and the canon law. Astonishing audacity ! So,
</p>
<p>then, the very foundations of Babylon the great are utterly
</p>
<p>burned with fire.
</p>
<p>"Who, then, had the courage, at that age and in those
</p>
<p>circumstances, to do that deed ? I answer, It was not by
</p>
<p>the courage of man that it was done, but by the courage
</p>
<p>of God. Nor did it express human passion. It was but
</p>
<p>an outward manifestation of the righteous judgment of
</p>
<p>the invisible yet present and avenging God.
</p>
<p>"When Luther began, he had not the remotest conception
</p>
<p>of the issue to which he should come. He believed in his
</p>
<p>heart that the pope had, by the will of God, supreme au-
</p>
<p>thority in the church. He trembled, step by step, as he
</p>
<p>encountered those deeprooted prejudices which had en-
</p>
<p>slaved him as well as the rest of Europe. But God would
</p>
<p>not let him rest. His word was in him like a fire in his
</p>
<p>bones as truth after truth was revealed to him ; and he
</p>
<p>was weary with forbearing and could not stay. God,
</p>
<p>too, who fits his instruments for his work, had fitted him
</p>
<p>to encounter the men and the system with whom he had
</p>
<p>to deal. They were impudent, and stiffnecked, and hard-

<p>hearted, and rebellious ; but God made his face strong
</p>
<p>368 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>against their faces and his forehead strong against their
</p>
<p>foreheads. As an adamant, harder than a flint, he made
</p>
<p>his forehead against their impudence and audacity.
</p>
<p>"When our souls have been filled with indignation, in
</p>
<p>view of the inconceivable abominations and atrocious
</p>
<p>slaughters of the Papacy, it is a joy to find that God has
</p>
<p>at length given to one man energy and courage, by words
</p>
<p>and by acts, to express the indignation of God. A brief
</p>
<p>account of the conflagration at Wittemberg has been
</p>
<p>given in the words of Luther himself. Let us now draw
</p>
<p>near and take a more full view of the scene as depicted
</p>
<p>by D'Aubigne:
</p>
<p>" On the 10th of December a placard was posted on
</p>
<p>the walls of the University of Wittemberg, inviting the
</p>
<p>professors and students to be present at nine o'clock in the
</p>
<p>morning at the eastern gate, near the Holy Cross. A
</p>
<p>great number of doctors and students assembled ; and Lu-
</p>
<p>ther, walking at their head, conducted the procession to
</p>
<p>the appointed place. How many burning piles has Rome
</p>
<p>erected during the course of ages ! Luther resolves to
</p>
<p>make a better application of the great Roman principle.
</p>
<p>It is only a few old papers that are about to be destroyed ;
</p>
<p>and fire, thinks he, is intended for that purpose. A scaf-
</p>
<p>fold had been prepared. One of the oldest masters of
</p>
<p>arts set fire to it. As the flames rose high into the air
</p>
<p>the formidable Augustine, wearing his frock, approached
</p>
<p>the pile, carrying the Canon Law, the Decretals, the Clem-
</p>
<p>entines, the Papal Extravagants, some writings by Eck
</p>
<p>and Emser, and the pope's bull. The decretals having
</p>
<p>been first consumed, Luther held up the bull and said,
</p>
<p>' Since thou hast vexed the Holy One of the Lord, may
</p>
<p>everlasting fire vex and consume thee ! ' He then flung
</p>
<p>it into the flames. Never had war been declared with
</p>
<p>greater energy and resolution. After this Luther calmly

</p>
<p>returned to the city ; and the crowd of doctors, professors,
</p>
<p>and students, testifying their approval by loud cheers,
</p>
<p>reentered "Wittemberg with him. ' The decretals,' said
</p>
<p>Luther, ' resemble a body whose face is meek as a young
</p>
<p>BABTLOX ON FIRE. 369
</p>
<p>maiden's, whose limbs are full of violence like those of a
</p>
<p>lion, and whose tail is filled with wiles like a serpent.
</p>
<p>Among all the laws of the popes, there is not one word
</p>
<p>that teaches us who is Jesus Christ.' ' My enemies,' said
</p>
<p>he on another occasion, ' have been able, by burning my
</p>
<p>books, to injure the cause of truth in the minds of the
</p>
<p>common people, and destroy their souls ; for this reason I
</p>
<p>consumed their-books in return. A serious struggle has
</p>
<p>just begun. Hitherto I have been only playing with the
</p>
<p>pope. I began this work in God's name ; it will be ended
</p>
<p>without me and by his might. If they dare burn my
</p>
<p>books, in which more of the gospel is to be found (I speak
</p>
<p>without boasting) than in all the books of the pope, I can
</p>
<p>with much greater reason burn theirs, in which no good
</p>
<p>can be discovered.'
</p>
<p>" Luther had reentered Wittemberg. On the morrow
</p>
<p>the lecture room was more crowded than usual. All minds
</p>
<p>were in a state of excitement ; a solemn feeling pervaded
</p>
<p>the assembly ; they waited, expecting an address from the
</p>
<p>doctor. He lectured on the Psalms a course that he
</p>
<p>had commenced in the month of March in the preceding
</p>
<p>year. Having finished his explanations he remained silent
</p>
<p>a few minutes, and then continued, energetically, 'Be on
</p>
<p>your guard against the laws and statutes of the pope. I
</p>
<p>have burned his decretals ; but this is merely child's play.
</p>
<p>It is time, and more than time, that the pope were burned ;
</p>
<p>that is, (explaining himself immediately,) the see of Rome,
</p>
<p>with all its doctrines and abominations.' Then, assuming
</p>
<p>a more solemn tone, he added, ' If you do not contend with
</p>
<p>your whole heart against the impious government of the
</p>
<p>pope, you cannot be saved. Whoever takes delight in the
</p>
<p>religion and worship of Popery will be eternally lost in
</p>
<p>the world to come.'
</p>
<p>" ' If you reject it,' continued he, ' you must expect to

</p>
<p>incur every kind of danger, and even to lose your lives.
</p>
<p>But it is far better to be exposed to such perils in this
</p>
<p>world than to keep silence. So long as I live I will de-
</p>
<p>nounce to my brethren the sore and the plague of Baby-
</p>
<p>lon, for fear that many who are with us should fall back
</p>
<p>like the rest into the bottomless pit.'
</p>
<p>" We can scarcely imagine the eft'ect produced on the
</p>
<p>assembly by this discourse, the energy of which surprises
</p>
<p>370 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>us. ' Not one among us,' adds the candid student who has
</p>
<p>handed it down, ' unless he be a senseless log of wood,
</p>
<p>(as all the Papists are, he says parenthetically,) doubts
</p>
<p>that this is truth pure and undefiled. It is evident to all
</p>
<p>believers that Dr. Luther is an angel of the living God,
</p>
<p>called to feed Christ's wandering sheep with the word
</p>
<p>of God.'"
</p>
<p>Here we have beyond all doubt the judgment of God,
</p>
<p>uttered by one of his servants whom he had raised up
</p>
<p>and qualified to engage in the great work upon which the
</p>
<p>interests of the church and the world and the glory of
</p>
<p>God were suspended.
</p>
<p>He had prepared the way for the work by the removal
</p>
<p>of the seat of the Papacy to Avignon, in France, after the
</p>
<p>death of Boniface VIII., and by the great and terrible
</p>
<p>schism that followed soon after it was removed again to
</p>
<p>Rome. For fifty years there were two rival lines of
</p>
<p>popes, each anathematizing the other and denouncing each
</p>
<p>other's crimes with about equal truth. Europe was nearly
</p>
<p>equally divided between them ; and, as Bonnechose says,
</p>
<p>" The nations that were subject to the pope, and bent the
</p>
<p>knee before this new divinity, knew not where to find
</p>
<p>their idol." Though the council of Constance healed the
</p>
<p>schism, it did not obliterate from the mind of Europe the
</p>
<p>questionings to which it gave rise. And as the arrogance,
</p>
<p>and rapacity, and immorality of the court of Rome in-
</p>
<p>creased, kings and people were so alienated, that, when
</p>
<p>Luther burned the pope's bull, the pope could not induce
</p>
<p>the secular powers to burn him ; and soon one half of Eu-
</p>
<p>rope was in open revolt against the Papal corporation.
</p>
<p>From that day to this the conflagration has gone on in
</p>
<p>different parts of the great city. In some parts it has
</p>
<p>been for a time extinguished by torrents of blood. But
</p>
<p>it is a fire kindled by God, the Omnipresent, the Almighty.

<p>Before it can be quenched, God must be* dethroned.

<p>CHAPTER II.
</p>
<p>THE FIRE OF GOD
</p>
<p>WHAT, then, are those great elements of truth through
</p>
<p>which God develops his fiery energy and by which he
</p>
<p>will at last utterly consume Babylon the great ?
</p>
<p>It is greatly for our interest to understand these truths.
</p>
<p>Our civil institutions as well as our religious are based
</p>
<p>upon them ; and between them and the Papal corporation
</p>
<p>there is a necessary, an inevitable, a mortal conflict.
</p>
<p>One or the other must die.
</p>
<p>The vital principle of the Romish corporation, as we have
</p>
<p>seen, is, that it is God's avowed purpose in communicating
</p>
<p>his grace to mankind to act through a corporate body ; and
</p>
<p>that they are that body, under the pope, their head.
</p>
<p>In direct antagonism to this is the great truth that, in
</p>
<p>communicating his grace to man, it is not God's purpose
</p>
<p>to limit himself to act through any one corporation what-
</p>
<p>ever, much less through the corporation of Rome. On
</p>
<p>the other hand, it is his purpose, and ever has been, to
</p>
<p>act at his pleasure through individuals, and to array them
</p>
<p>against any and all corporations whenever necessary to
</p>
<p>rebuke their negligence of duty or disobedience to God.
</p>
<p>It will not be denied, not even by a Romanist with
</p>
<p>any reverence for God, that God is able, if he pleases, to
</p>
<p>manifest himself to individuals in all ages, independently
</p>
<p>of any corporation ; to illuminate them, to sanctify them,

</p>
<p>to avert mental disease, to give them wisdom, courage, dis-
</p>
<p>cretion, zeal, energy, and in all things to qualify them to
</p>
<p>do his will. None but an atheist can deny that God has
</p>
<p>the power to do this.
</p>
<p>The question is simply one of fact. It is this : Is it
</p>
<p>God's will to do this ? To this the Papists reply, No ;
</p>
<p>the Protestants, Yes.
</p>
<p>Here, then, is the issue ; and there neither is nor can
</p>
<p>be a greater issue than this. It is an issue that divides
</p>
<p>the world, and the decision of which will agitate the
</p>
<p>world as with an earthquake.
</p>
<p>The claim of any corporation, on any ground, of a
</p>
<p>monopoly of the grace of God, is the great source of spirit-
</p>
<p>ual despotism and of religious and civil bondage. It is
</p>
<p>the source of all ecclesiastical arrogance and ambition.
</p>
<p>It is an impious invasion of the rights of individual
</p>
<p>minds in God and of the rights of God in individual
</p>
<p>minds. It assails the principles on which God has organ-
</p>
<p>ized society, not only in this, but in all worlds. It is a
</p>
<p>direct warfare with the purposes and with the omnipo-
</p>
<p>tence of God.
</p>
<p>And yet it is upon this claim that the corporation of
</p>
<p>Rome is based. This corporation arrogates the right to
</p>
<p>come between God and all individuals whatever. No
</p>
<p>one can come to God but through them ; nor will God
</p>
<p>come to any one but through them. Outside of them-
</p>
<p>selves there is no God, no radiance of heaven ; all is
</p>
<p>empty of divine grace and dark as the bottomless pit.
</p>
<p>This is the great, the impious, the malignant, the all-
</p>
<p>comprehending, the heaven-daring, the God-defying lie of
</p>
<p>Romanism. It is a lie on earth ; it is a lie in all worlds ;
</p>
<p>it is at war with the very nature and structure of all
</p>
<p>created minds.

</p>
<p>never will man have true freedom, never will society be
</p>
<p>truly organized till this is properly understood.
</p>
<p>Let us, then, look into this matter. If we once thor-
</p>
<p>oughly understand it, we shall need to consider little else
</p>
<p>in order to see the impious and damnable nature of the
</p>
<p>claims of Rome. As Americans, and as lovers of our
</p>
<p>country and of the world, we are specially called on to
</p>
<p>go to the very roots of this question. We are bound to
</p>
<p>dig deep, till we are sure that all of our principles and
</p>
<p>institutions are based on the solid rock of eternal truth.
</p>
<p>It is a question of deep interest, What is God's design
</p>
<p>in raising up this nation ? What is the destiny of our in-
</p>
<p>stitutions, and what their dangers ? The usual answer
</p>
<p>among us has been, To aid in the work of destroying the
</p>
<p>despotisms of the old world ; and their chief danger is
</p>
<p>from the Papacy and its connected civil systems. A new
</p>
<p>answer has lately been given : Our chief danger lies in
</p>
<p>our revolt from the Papacy. Nothing but the Papacy
</p>
<p>can save us.
</p>
<p>One thing is plain nothing but God can save us ; and
</p>
<p>he will not save us unless we acknowledge and defend his
</p>
<p>rights in the human soul and the rights of the human
</p>
<p>soul in him. I propose to develop them ; to show their
</p>
<p>relations to all organizations, civil or ecclesiastical ; and
</p>
<p>to demonstrate that the claims of the Popish hierarchy
</p>
<p>are at war with them all.

<p>GOD'S RIGHTS IN THE SOUL AND OF THE SOUL IN GO!

<p>God's rights in the soul will be disclosed by studying,

</p>
<p>the soul capable of independent perfection that is, per-
</p>
<p>fection in the separate and independent use of its own
</p>
<p>powers. On the other hand, the soul was either design-
</p>
<p>edly, or more probably of necessity, made and left imper-
</p>
<p>fect in itself, and unable to gain its true destiny without
</p>
<p>a concurrent action of God in and through it. Thus no
</p>
<p>plant has in itself the power of perfect development and
</p>
<p>growth out of its proper relations to the soil, air, light,
</p>
<p>heat, and water, that are designed to nourish and develop
</p>
<p>it. Now, as these elements are to the development of a
</p>
<p>plant, so is God to the development and perfection of the
</p>
<p>mind. All created minds have a natural and an eternal
</p>
<p>need of God in order to retain moral and intellectual
</p>
<p>health and to secure a beautiful and perfect development.
</p>
<p>This necessity is so founded in the nature of things that
</p>
<p>it cannot be suspended. The idea that any mind can be
</p>
<p>to itself as a god, knowing good and evil, and that it is
</p>
<p>or can be perfect in itself without a constant concurrent
</p>
<p>influence of God, is the root of pride and all falsehood ;
</p>
<p>it is an essential revolt from God and all truth. It was
</p>
<p>the primal sin and ruin of Satan ; it is the radical ele-
</p>
<p>ment of his most fatal temptations in this age of pride
</p>
<p>and of the worship of human reason.
</p>
<p>Let us, then, look at the correlation of God and of the
</p>
<p>human mind. As God is infinite in intellect, in love, in
</p>
<p>sympathy, in power ; and as he fills all time and all space
</p>
<p>by his existence, attributes, and kingdom ; and as of the
</p>
<p>increase of his kingdom there is to be no end ; and as the
</p>
<p>mind was made to know him and be blessed in his love,
</p>
<p>it was made with power to conceive of infinitude in intel-
</p>
<p>lect, emotion, sympathy, time, space, numbers, and power,
</p>
<p>but not to fill its own conceptions. It was made to be
</p>
<p>filled with all the fulness of God, and with nothing be-
</p>
<p>sides. He is the natural complement of the soul ; and in

<p>him it lives and is perfected.
</p>
<p>THE FIRE OP GOD. 375
</p>
<p>Hence the primary law of the mind is direct conscious
</p>
<p>unity with God in thought, love, and will. " He that
</p>
<p>dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him. Ye
</p>
<p>shall know that ye are in me and I in you. Because I
</p>
<p>live, ye shall live also. I live ; yet not I, but Christ liveth
</p>
<p>in me. Thou art the Fountain of life. In thy light shall
</p>
<p>we see light." Hence God's rights in the soul involve the
</p>
<p>right to insist that no created being or corporation shall
</p>
<p>attempt to interfere with or to prevent this direct union
</p>
<p>of the soul to God, this conscious personal contact of the
</p>
<p>soul with God.
</p>
<p>The rights of the soul in God correspond. The soul
</p>
<p>has a right to claim at all times this personal access to
</p>
<p>God, this conscious personal union to him and life and
</p>
<p>perfection in and by him. Ko man or body of men have
</p>
<p>a right to attempt to monopolize it any more than to mo-
</p>
<p>nopolize the right to breathe the air or to see the sun.
</p>
<p>These are the fundamental rights of God and of every
</p>
<p>created being in his universe. No personal rights, no
</p>
<p>laws of organization, can rise above them. They are the
</p>
<p>very basis of the universe irrepealable, eternal.
</p>
<p>Let us study the relations of these principles to faith.
</p>
<p>The mind of man was made to rest in a certain knowledge
</p>
<p>of spiritual truth. But the centre of all truth is God ;
</p>
<p>for he is the greatest of objects to be known, and the Cre-
</p>
<p>ator of all existences besides himself, and rules through-
</p>
<p>out the universe, and works all things after the counsel
</p>
<p>of his own will. Of him, through him, and to him are
</p>
<p>all things. Hence he is the Author of all truth ; he sees it
</p>
<p>in all its relations and harmonies ; and he is .the Sun who,
</p>
<p>by his illuminating power, makes the system in its symme-
</p>
<p>try visible to other minds.
</p>
<p>It is therefore the glorious prerogative of God, and of

<p>God alone, to give to any mind that highest certainty of
</p>
<p>376 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>spiritual truth which is necessary to give rest to the soul.
</p>
<p>The mind, being imperfect in itself, cannot, by any process
</p>
<p>of reasoning and power of its own, put itself in that
</p>
<p>state of clear and certain perception of the system in
</p>
<p>which it is, except by that concurrent action of God and
</p>
<p>the soul for which it was made. To a soul in this state
</p>
<p>God is a constant, unsetting Sun, in whose light all truth
</p>
<p>is seen in its true colors and proportions. It is not a
</p>
<p>state of mysticism or enthusiasm, (using these terms in
</p>
<p>the common bad sense,) but a state of calm intellectual
</p>
<p>and moral health and life, in which God guides and aids
</p>
<p>in the study of all truth, whether disclosed in the struc-
</p>
<p>ture and laws of the mind itself, or of the body, or of the
</p>
<p>material world, or by providence, or by the revealed
</p>
<p>Scriptures, and gives a point of vision from which to see
</p>
<p>all truth.
</p>
<p>This concurrent action of the divine and human mind
</p>
<p>is the highest element of the faith by which God keeps
</p>
<p>the soul holy unto salvation. There is a natural faith, in-
</p>
<p>volving all that the mind can do to produce belief by a
</p>
<p>logical exercise of its own powers. But it does not sat-
</p>
<p>isfy the wants of the mind ; it does not give rest to all
</p>
<p>its powers ; it does not give that certainty and repose
</p>
<p>for which it longs. The concurrent action of God with
</p>
<p>the mind introduces a supernatural element, and thus per-
</p>
<p>fects faith, meets all the demands of the mind, and gives
</p>
<p>it rest in God. In his light it sees light and is certain.
</p>
<p>(See 1 John. ii. 26, 27.)
</p>
<p>This leads to no neglect of evidence or means of knowl-
</p>
<p>edge. It impels to the study of the mind as made in the
</p>
<p>image of God, and therefore the key to unlock his mind
</p>
<p>to the soul, to the study of his works, and providence,
</p>
<p>and word, as parts of one harmonious disclosure of God
</p>
<p>and his plans in divers ways. It uses all parts of the sys-

</p>
<p>tem of truth, and neglects none.
</p>
<p>THE FIRE OF GOD. 377
</p>
<p>Hence it is a right of God that all souls shall come di-
</p>
<p>rectly to him for faith ; and it is the right of all souls
</p>
<p>thus to come. Indeed it is absurd to think of gaining it
</p>
<p>in any other way, and an invasion of the rights of God
</p>
<p>and of man to affirm that any man or body of men can
</p>
<p>stand between God and the soul as essential to faith.
</p>
<p>This state of faith, I have said, is supernatural ; not
</p>
<p>because it does not correspond with the natural and origi-
</p>
<p>nal state of the mind, but because all men are fallen, and
</p>
<p>depraved, and separated from God by sin. Hence the need
</p>
<p>of atonement, pardon, and regeneration by the Holy Spir-
</p>
<p>it in order to bring the mind into this state of faith.
</p>
<p>Hence all efforts to reach God except through Christ
</p>
<p>fail of producing faith, because they do not convince of
</p>
<p>sin, purify and forgive, and truly reunite to God. All
</p>
<p>such efforts land in infidelity, pantheism, or atheism.
</p>
<p>MODES OF DIVINE ACTION IN SOCIETY.
</p>
<p>Thus have we considered God's direct action on the
</p>
<p>soul and the rights growing out of it. Besides this, God
</p>
<p>resorts to two indirect modes of action on the soul
</p>
<p>one through individuals, another through organizations.
</p>
<p>But these are always subordinated to his rights as it re-
</p>
<p>gards the first great law. God, then, is pleased to sancti-
</p>
<p>fy individual minds and act and speak through them, pro-
</p>
<p>ducing by the influence of creatures on creatures a new
</p>
<p>series of effects. To do this is God's great delight. He
</p>
<p>can train and form individual minds exactly to his will,
</p>
<p>and then utter all his heart by them. This is not true of
</p>
<p>corporations ; there is in them no unity of character.
</p>
<p>All great revolutions God has produced by the power of
</p>
<p>individual minds, urging others towards God, holding up

</p>
<p>elevated principles, and yet leaving men free. Yea, it is
</p>
<p>the instinctive tendency of all such minds to throw men
</p>
<p>off from themselves upon God. If any fall down to wor-
</p>
<p>ship, they say with the angel, " See thou do it not. I am
</p>
<p>thy fellow-servant. "Worship God."
</p>
<p>Lastly. God acts indirectly through organization,
</p>
<p>through the family, schools, churches, and civil govern-
</p>
<p>ments. But the first duty of all such organizations is, not
</p>
<p>to rise above God's first law and rights, but to regard
</p>
<p>and defend them against all invasion. Of civil govern-
</p>
<p>ments, the ends are, to prescribe the established modes of
</p>
<p>organic action and to regulate and defend rights. Their
</p>
<p>great effort should be to remove the disposition to do
</p>
<p>wrong, to increase individual knowledge and the power
</p>
<p>of self-government, and to throw as much responsibility
</p>
<p>on individuals, families, and towns as they can, and thus
</p>
<p>reduce the work of the higher class of rulers to the
</p>
<p>smallest possible extent. Thus, as the individuals, fami-
</p>
<p>lies, and towns become a law unto themselves, will the
</p>
<p>general government be more and more simple and less
</p>
<p>and less expensive. Reject, too, the idea that any organi-
</p>
<p>zation has been established for the honor, glory, or emol-
</p>
<p>ument of those who use it, or that God has any interest
</p>
<p>in having it so. The highest honor that God can receive
</p>
<p>is to give constant force to the first great direct law of
</p>
<p>concurrent action between him and the soul ; for it is
</p>
<p>the true glory of God, by a direct and omnipresent yet
</p>
<p>invisible influence on all men, to reduce the world to such
</p>
<p>order that all human governments will become so simple
</p>
<p>that men will scarcely feel their existence, and only use
</p>
<p>them as necessary guides and rules of organic action.
</p>
<p>Hence the idea that the glory of God can be promoted
</p>
<p>by exalting the glory of a given external organization is

<p>false and absurd.

</p>
<p>The glory of God consists in the universal instruction,
</p>
<p>sanctification, and exaltation of the individuals of the hu-
</p>
<p>man race to the highest degree, and in the government of
</p>
<p>them by his invisible but sweet and blessed power, and
</p>
<p>then arranging them in those simple and free organiza-
</p>
<p>tions into which men would naturally fall who are thus
</p>
<p>filled with the fulness of God.
</p>
<p>THE GLORY OF AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS.
</p>
<p>This is the true view of the principles of organization ;
</p>
<p>and it is the grand peculiarity of ours, first of all on
</p>
<p>earth, that they are based on the principle of defending
</p>
<p>to the utmost the rights of God in the human soul and
</p>
<p>of the human soul in God. And, if properly used, they
</p>
<p>can secure the perfect results of which I have spoken.
</p>
<p>De Tocqueville noticed with admiration the extent to
</p>
<p>which in our institutions the responsibilities of govern-
</p>
<p>ment were thrown upon the townships, families, and indi-
</p>
<p>viduals, and thus withdrawn from the care of the state
</p>
<p>and national governments. Increase this tendency; defend
</p>
<p>the rights of God in individuals and the rights of indi-
</p>
<p>viduals in God ; give new power to the direct relationship
</p>
<p>between God and the soul; and, as the power of the invis-
</p>
<p>ible government of God increases, the cares and respon-
</p>
<p>sibilities of the state and national governments will be-
</p>
<p>come less. Every thing in our organizations will be sim-
</p>
<p>plified ; men will be free as the air that they breathe ; and,
</p>
<p>over all, and in all, and through all, the invisible but om-
</p>
<p>nipresent God will be for a glory and for a defence.

<p>This is not the infidel or transcendental millennium ; it

<p>This is the state towards which all true views of God and

<p>repeal and tread under foot the fundamental law of the

<p>universe of created minds ; to expel God from the world

<p>itself and the great duty of man, so that in effect it shall

<p>ble, unintelligible something which it calls grace, and
</p>
<p>which is transmitted to the soul, not by instruction, nor by
</p>
<p>any truth perceived and felt, nor by any intelligent action
</p>
<p>of the intellect and emotions, but by external, material
</p>
<p>means called sacraments. This above all other things is
</p>
<p>an exquisite device of the devil to destroy the importance
</p>
<p>of instruction, and intelligent, personal communion with
</p>
<p>God ; it is the master key to the dungeon of spiritual
</p>
<p>despotism ; for, the moment you make external, material
</p>
<p>sacraments the channel of what is called grace instead of
</p>
<p>instruction and a clear perception of the truth, and then
</p>
<p>give to the Romish corporation the sole right to administer
</p>
<p>these sacraments, you have darkened and enslaved the
</p>
<p>world. The importance of study, preaching, thought is
</p>
<p>destroyed. A dead language is as good as any other as a
</p>
<p>medium of worship. A cloud is drawn over God and the
</p>
<p>glories of his throne ; all direct access to him for life is
</p>
<p>cut off ; and men lie trembling at the feet of those who, by
</p>
<p>refusing the sacraments, can exclude them from heaven
</p>
<p>and consign them to hell. The power over the sacraments,
</p>
<p>on this view, is the possession of the keys of heaven and
</p>
<p>hell ; and it involves the virtual destruction of all need of
</p>
<p>preaching or of thought.
</p>
<p>2. This corporation has corrupted all ideas of saving
</p>
<p>faith by designedly shaking confidence in the Bible as a
</p>
<p>revelation intelligible to the common mind and sufficient for
</p>
<p>salvation through faith in Christ. It has even taken part

<p>THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>create the necessity of aid from an infallible corporation,
</p>
<p>with the design of making saving faith to mean, in fact, an
</p>
<p>implicit belief in just what they say, instead of a penitent
</p>
<p>reliance on the atonement of Christ for salvation, by which
</p>
<p>the soul is reunited directly to God and the affections and
</p>
<p>will harmonized with those of God. The design is to cut
</p>
<p>man off from God and from the Bible and to destroy all
</p>
<p>standards of appeal above and beyond themselves, making
</p>
<p>the Bible merely their creature and tool, and its meaning
</p>
<p>just what suits them best. They tell us the Bible is a dead
</p>
<p>book and needs a living interpreter. Do not all human
</p>
<p>lawgivers say they establish judges to interpret human
</p>
<p>laws ? But the cases are unlike. Men make human laws
</p>
<p>and can unmake them, and their penalties are limited to
</p>
<p>this world. Men also can remove judges if they interpret
</p>
<p>wrongfully. God makes a revelation ; and, when made,
</p>
<p>not all the earth can alter it ; and its penalties are beyond
</p>
<p>this world and eternal. He, therefore, who has the exclu-
</p>
<p>sive divine power to interpret a divine, immutable revela-
</p>
<p>tion, has in full all of the powers of the Deity centred in
</p>
<p>him ; nor can the whole world judge or remove him. He
</p>
<p>is the acting god of this world. His word is law : the
</p>
<p>Bible is nothing. The system is in theory and practice an
</p>
<p>annihilation of God and of the Bible, and an enthronement
</p>
<p>of the pope or the Papal corporation in place of God ;
</p>
<p>and all that the pope has ever claimed, all that his highest
</p>
<p>flatterers ever gave him, to reign as the only god on
</p>
<p>earth, is the legitimate result of the system either for him
</p>
<p>or for his corporation. Thus does this corporation repeal
</p>
<p>the first great law of God, destroy the rights of God in
</p>
<p>the human soul and the rights of the human soul in God,
</p>
<p>and concentrate in itself all of the prerogatives of God.

<p>mere organization above the importance of holiness. It
</p>
<p>THE FIRE OF GOD. 383
</p>
<p>makes an alleged means of more importance to God than
</p>
<p>the great end of all means ; that is, personal union to God
</p>
<p>in holiness and truth. It has acted on and established the
</p>
<p>principle that the Papal corporation is so important that
</p>
<p>no amount of sin in its head, or members, or servants can
</p>
<p>vacate its charter. If the pope is the veriest moral
</p>
<p>monster ever seen on earth ; if the bishops are a gang of
</p>
<p>debauchees and swindlers ; if the priests are all fornicators,
</p>
<p>adulterers, and seducers, it is no sufficient reason for
</p>
<p>abandoning the system. IF THE RIGHTS OF THE CORPORATION
</p>
<p>ARE GIVEN UP OR DESTROYED, then the gates of hell pre-
</p>
<p>vail against the church. But if every vestige of hpliness
</p>
<p>ceases in the popes for centuries, if bishops and priests are
</p>
<p>for centuries sunk in the slough of sensuality and pollution,
</p>
<p>and become the chief corrupters of the human race, still,
</p>
<p>IF THE CORPORATION ONLY KEEPS ITS POWER, then the gates
</p>
<p>of hell do not prevail ; then the church is safe. What
</p>
<p>higher blasphemy of God, what higher contempt of holi-
</p>
<p>ness, is possible than is involved in these principles ? And
</p>
<p>yet they are the real and only practical principles of the
</p>
<p>Romish corporation ; and they have acted them out for
</p>
<p>ages.
</p>
<p>If any amount of the vilest sins that the mind of man
</p>
<p>can conceive, in popes, bishops, and priests, could vacate the
</p>
<p>claims of a corporation, long since those of Rome had
</p>
<p>been vacated. The records of the world may be searched
</p>
<p>in vain for such depths of moral pollution and degradation
</p>
<p>as are found in the history of this corporation, not as rare
</p>
<p>exceptions for long centuries, but as the general law.
</p>
<p>The hierarchy and the priesthood of Rome have, as a
</p>
<p>general fact, been the great central channel of the pollu-
</p>
<p>tions of the Romish world, an insult to God, a scandal to
</p>
<p>humanity. Nor need we wonder. The system is skilfully

</p>
<p>produce these results. It is by its structure the hotbed
</p>
<p>of ambition, pride, the love of money and of power. The
</p>
<p>great law of the compulsory celibacy of the clergy, together
</p>
<p>with the established practice of appointing unmarried ec-
</p>
<p>clesiastics to examine females in the confessional on all
</p>
<p>points on which a polluted mind can form a conception, is
</p>
<p>as perfect a system for debauching the clergy as Satan
</p>
<p>could devise ; and, when not checked by Protestantism, it
</p>
<p>has been terribly, inconceivably effectual. The sober facts
</p>
<p>of history are too shameful to state. They are so enor-
</p>
<p>mous as to defy belief till the philosophy of the system is
</p>
<p>studied from which they spring. And yet the system is
</p>
<p>skilfully constructed to sustain and survive all this. That
</p>
<p>satanic idea of grace, "where there is neither Christian
</p>
<p>instruction nor Christian example, grace through material
</p>
<p>sacraments, and in spite of a polluted corporation, removes
</p>
<p>the whole difficulty. It gives to Satan his highest result.
</p>
<p>It enables him to establish on earth, in the name of God,
</p>
<p>a corporate body, with an irrevocable charter, which no
</p>
<p>amount of sin can forfeit.
</p>
<p>Let the pope be or do what he may. He may be (and
</p>
<p>I am now referring to actual facts) an atheist ; he may be
</p>
<p>perjured before God and man ; he may be a poisoner and
</p>
<p>an assassin ; he may be a drunkard ; he may be an infidel,
</p>
<p>a blasphemer, an adulterer ; he may sacrifice to Venus
</p>
<p>and to the devil ; he may commit incest with his own ille-
</p>
<p>gitimate daughter ; he may debauch by violence all the
</p>
<p>females who come to Rome on whom he can lay his
</p>
<p>hands ; the majority of the popes for long, dark ages
</p>
<p>may give no evidence of piety, and clear proof that they
</p>
<p>are the firstborn of Satan. It makes no odds. Home is
</p>
<p>still the centre of unity for the whole Christian world.
</p>
<p>The pope in his bulls, speaking ex cathedra, is still the

</p>
<p>THE FIRE OF GOD. 385
</p>
<p>The system still stands. Apostolic grace still descends
</p>
<p>through the great filthy central channel.
</p>
<p>So, too, the bishops assembled in council may be igno-
</p>
<p>rant, polluted, and sunk in the slough of all filth. They
</p>
<p>i^ay so debauch the place in which they meet as to make
</p>
<p>it one vast house of ill fame, as Matthew Paris, a contem-
</p>
<p>porary historian, states that Cardinal Hugo in his closing
</p>
<p>speech after the council of Lyons declared to be a fact
</p>
<p>as regarded that place ; they may discuss doctrines in the
</p>
<p>midst of throngs of prostitutes gathered for their recep-
</p>
<p>tion, as was the case in the co'uncil of Constance, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to Dachery, Bruys, and the Vienna manuscript ;
</p>
<p>their character may be like that of the council of Con-
</p>
<p>stance drawn by Baptiza, one of its own members, " actu-
</p>
<p>ated only by malice, iniquity, pride, vanity, ignorance,
</p>
<p>lasciviousness, avarice, pomp, simony, and dissimulation."
</p>
<p>Still such men are authorized to call themselves a holy
</p>
<p>council, assembled in the Holy Ghost to interpret infal-
</p>
<p>libly the word of God and to commit all contumacious
</p>
<p>rebels against their authority to the flames. God, it
</p>
<p>seems, has given an irrevocable charter to such councils
</p>
<p>to preserve in its purity the Christian faith. And so
</p>
<p>firm is this charter that no conceivable amount of sin
</p>
<p>can vacate it.
</p>
<p>So, too, the whole clergy may be, in the language of St.
</p>
<p>Bernard, " pastors in name, but in reality plunderers ;
</p>
<p>who, unsatisfied with the fleece, thirst for the blood of the
</p>
<p>flock, and merit the appellation of traitors ; who do not
</p>
<p>feed, but slay and devour, the sheep ; who melt in the fur-
</p>
<p>nace of covetousness, and dare for gain to barter assas-
</p>
<p>sination, adultery, incest, fornication, sacrilege, and per-
</p>
<p>jury." And yet it makes no odds. The system has a
</p>
<p>charter from God. No amount of sin can repeal it.

</p>
<p>time of the most full and perfect development of the sys-
</p>
<p>tem of the Papal corporation ; and during this time, accord-
</p>
<p>ing to their own historians, the Papal world, clergy and
</p>
<p>laity, were, as a general fact, sunk 'in the lowest depth of
</p>
<p>moral pollution.
</p>
<p>Sabellicus, Stella, Baronius, Giannone, Dupin, William
</p>
<p>of Paris, Spondanus, Morlaix, Honorius, St. Bernard, John
</p>
<p>of Salisbury, Alliaco, Petrarch, Dante, Marianna, ^Egid-
</p>
<p>ius, Mirandula, Fordun, Gerson, Madruccio, Cervino,
</p>
<p>Pole, Monte, Sarpi, and others may be summoned to estab-
</p>
<p>lish these assertions by an amount of testimony and in
</p>
<p>a fervor and eloquence of language in comparison with
</p>
<p>which all I have said or can say would be weak and pow-
</p>
<p>erless.
</p>
<p>They deemed these results, indeed, abuses of the true
</p>
<p>system, and called aloud for reform. But they were no
</p>
<p>abuses; they were its genuine legitimate results. The
</p>
<p>system is exquisitely adapted by satanic skill utterly
</p>
<p>to corrupt those whose example and influence must
</p>
<p>have chief power, and by them to debauch and ruin the
</p>
<p>world. Hence, the nearer you come to the centre of the
</p>
<p>system, the deeper in all ages has been the moral degra-
</p>
<p>dation.
</p>
<p>Now, suppose in the days of Christ it had been said to
</p>
<p>Satan, God's great law of influencing men by a holy ex-
</p>
<p>ample is now developed in full power in Christ and. in
</p>
<p>Paul and the apostles ; there are free churches, and God
</p>
<p>is open to all ; you are in imminent danger of ruin ; what
</p>
<p>will you do ? and suppose he had said, I will by forgeries
</p>
<p>concentrate all these free churches under one head ; I will
</p>
<p>cut off all men from the right of direct access to God with-
</p>
<p>out him and his corporation ; I will make him, when
</p>
<p>fully developed, the image of the devil, and debase the

<p>corporation to the lowest depths of pollution ; and yet I
</p>
<p>THE FIRE OF GOD. 387
</p>
<p>will give them an irrepealable charter from God to be
</p>
<p>the only channels of life to the world, would it not have
</p>
<p>seemed incredible even to hell itself that such a work
</p>
<p>could be done ? Yet it has been done ; and Mr. Brownson
</p>
<p>has the audacity to present this system to us as the only
</p>
<p>road to heaven and the only defence of our free institu-
</p>
<p>tions from ruin.
</p>
<p>4. Let us, then, finally look at the influence of this sys-
</p>
<p>tem on civil organizations. Let such a power, then, exist
</p>
<p>and develop itself, and gain full control over the people,
</p>
<p>and it will surely overrule, and subdue, and corrupt all
</p>
<p>the civil authorities of our country nay, of the world.
</p>
<p>The central theocracy will control the people by the fears
</p>
<p>of hell and the hope of heaven, and in a conflict with
</p>
<p>rulers will undermine them, if they dare to resist, by turn-
</p>
<p>ing the people against them, as they did in the middle
</p>
<p>ages. Again : the central theocracy will divide the civil
</p>
<p>powers and subdue them one by one, rallying the obedi-
</p>
<p>ent against the refractory, as it did in the case of John
</p>
<p>of England. If he had not submitted, his kingdom would
</p>
<p>have been given to the King of France. And so long as
</p>
<p>the sphere of every civil power is. local, while the theoc-
</p>
<p>racy is universal and holds the people by the hopes and
</p>
<p>fears of eternity, any civil power can be overruled and
</p>
<p>crushed.
</p>
<p>I need not say that the system has no tendency to
</p>
<p>sanctify and educate the masses, and make individuals
</p>
<p>independent thinkers, and to throw them upon God for
</p>
<p>life, light, and government : this course would be inev-
</p>
<p>itable death to the system. Its managers well know it,
</p>
<p>and hate and fear such a course as they do the plague.
</p>
<p>What they desire is, not a people so holy, so elevated as
</p>
<p>individuals, so intelligent, so given to reading, thought,

</p>
<p>and life in him that he, and he only, is their real and con-
</p>
<p>stant rule, but implicit, unquestioning faith in themselves
</p>
<p>and unthinking obedience to their decrees. Never did
</p>
<p>they make deliberate efforts to give an elevating educa-
</p>
<p>tion to the mass of the people never will they. It is
</p>
<p>death to the system to do it.
</p>
<p>Nor does the system tend in its ultimate results to
</p>
<p>simplify organization and reduce the expenses of govern-
</p>
<p>ment. By its own spirit and example it fosters the love
</p>
<p>of worldly pomp and authority and of extravagant cen-
</p>
<p>tralized aristocratic systems. It will be, as it always has
</p>
<p>been, the great corrupter of all earthly governments, by
</p>
<p>sanctioning in the name of God all the sins and abuses
</p>
<p>to which they are most prone. Think what a centraliza-
</p>
<p>tion of government would be effected if all the religious
</p>
<p>interests of a hierarchy, governing Europe, Asia, Africa,
</p>
<p>North and South America, and the islands of the sea, were
</p>
<p>centralized at Rome ! What trains of legates, what a
</p>
<p>complicated machinery of ecclesiastical rulers, for the
</p>
<p>whole globe I What imagination can penetrate the infi-
</p>
<p>nite details, the boundless extravagance and extortion, of
</p>
<p>such a system? And with such examples before their
</p>
<p>eyes, will secular rulers, in their civil relations, learn to
</p>
<p>be simple, humble, and unassuming? And will society
</p>
<p>ever be regulated simply by the spiritual presence of an
</p>
<p>invisible God, as an unsetting sun ? Never ; no, never.
</p>
<p>Finally. It is not possible for the human mind to
</p>
<p>conceive of a more perfect antagonist to God and to his
</p>
<p>system and to our institutions than exists in the system
</p>
<p>of the Papal corporation. It meets and conflicts with
</p>
<p>them at every point with deadly hatred. In one system
</p>
<p>is developed the full soul of Satan, in the other of God ;
</p>
<p>and it is the final collision of these systems and their

<p>advocates that is near at hand. So sure as* there is a

<p>THE FIEE OF GOD. 389
</p>
<p>God, the result cannot be doubtful. The Papal corpora-
</p>
<p>tion and its allies shall be cast alive into the lake of fire.
</p>
<p>We are to judge of the real end of a system by regard-
</p>
<p>ing, not what it professes, but what it is adapted to do
</p>
<p>and what in fact it has done.
</p>
<p>If a set of men were among us from Russia, building
</p>
<p>massive stone buildings, forging chains, putting in grated
</p>
<p>windows, fitting up dark cells, and surrounding them with
</p>
<p>walls, and should all the time profess to be merely erect-
</p>
<p>ing colleges ; then putting up strong stone edifices on
</p>
<p>commanding points, with portholes, and trenches, and
</p>
<p>covered ways, calling them barns for cattle, and then fill-
</p>
<p>ing other buildings with muskets, and powder, and shot,
</p>
<p>and calling them hunting establishments ; and if, in the
</p>
<p>whole empire of Russia, there was talk of colonies to
</p>
<p>America, of officers and students for the colleges, and of
</p>
<p>farmers to take care of these barns, and of hunters to use
</p>
<p>these guns, do you think that this thin veil of words would
</p>
<p>hide the real nature of the system that was in preparation ?
</p>
<p>Would not the sagacious say, These are fine words indeed;
</p>
<p>but this looks far more like war, and subjugation, and
</p>
<p>prisons, than like colleges, and barns, and hunting?
</p>
<p>Even so it is with this system. It calls itself, boastfully,
</p>
<p>the only holy church. Its avowed ends are to produce
</p>
<p>faith, and thus to save souls ; to restore men to God, to
</p>
<p>disclose his relations, to lead them to keep his laws. But,
</p>
<p>judged by its structure, its real and only end is to aggran-
</p>
<p>dize a set of ecclesiastics at the expense of God and the
</p>
<p>human race.
</p>
<p>It is precisely adapted to enable a set of the most un-
</p>
<p>principled men whom the world ever saw to make use
</p>
<p>of the name of God and of the eternal sanctions of his
</p>
<p>government as the basis of a system the great end of
</p>
<p>which is to subjugate the human race to themselves, and

<p>PROTESTANTISM DEFENDED.
</p>
<p>IP Eomanism is in its very essence, as has been proved,
</p>
<p>a fraudulent, perfidious, and treacherous conspiracy
</p>
<p>against all of the rights of humanity ; if its tendencies
</p>
<p>and results prove it to be the immitigable enemy of man-
</p>
<p>kind in all their interests, pecuniary, social, civil, and
</p>
<p>religious ; if its lofty, arrogant, and impious claims are
</p>
<p>based upon mere imposture ; if it was originated and
</p>
<p>perfected only through a series of the most stupendous
</p>
<p>frauds and forgeries, in comparison with which the forge-
</p>
<p>ries of Mormonism are completely thrown into the shade ;
</p>
<p>if it has always rendered its clergy, as a body, debauched,
</p>
<p>licentious, and profligate, so that the open though corrupt
</p>
<p>polygamy of Mormonism is no worse, or rather is much
</p>
<p>better, than their atrocious and widespread seductions
</p>
<p>only a very small part of which has ever come to light,
</p>
<p>though even that small part is enough to fill the world
</p>
<p>with their infamy ; if, when in power, they have remorse-
</p>
<p>lessly butchered whole Christian communities, whose only
</p>
<p>crime was that they preferred the truth and purity of
</p>
<p>God to the impositions and to the pollutions of Rome ;
</p>
<p>if it is an essential part of the system (avowed, estab-
</p>
<p>lished, and practised by councils, popes, and Jesuits) to lie,
</p>
<p>to swear falsely, and to practise perjury for the destruc-
</p>
<p>tion of all heretics ; if the system is the most perfect

</p>
<p>incarnation of all villany, diabolism, and profligacy ever
</p>
<p>known on earth ; if the conscientious treachery and
</p>
<p>stranglings of the Thugs of India, in the service of their
</p>
<p>malign divinity, are altogether eclipsed by the conscien-
</p>
<p>tious treachery and butcheries, burnings and tortures, of
</p>
<p>Eomish popes, bishops, priests, and inquisitors ; if all this
</p>
<p>and more is true, (and that it is true has been shown, not
</p>
<p>by declamation, but by a simple statement of only a part
</p>
<p>of the multitudinous facts of history facts open, noto-
</p>
<p>rious, uncontrovertible facts that blaze from the pages
</p>
<p>of history like the sun at noonday,) then no more need
</p>
<p>be said to justify the existence of Protestantism and to
</p>
<p>vindicate its godlike character and divine origin. It is
</p>
<p>enough to say that it is the protest of God, through the
</p>
<p>Bible and through humanity, against a system of such
</p>
<p>atrocity and blasphemy.
</p>
<p>To decide this whole great controversy, nothing is
</p>
<p>needed but a simple historical statement of what Popery
</p>
<p>is and has done. Moreover, if the European and Ameri-
</p>
<p>can world do not mean to have this infernal system
</p>
<p>astride their necks forever, like the old man of the moun-
</p>
<p>tains upon the neck of Sinbad the sailor ; if, in the elo-
</p>
<p>quent words of Conelly, they do not mean to have Rome
</p>
<p>weigh down upon their dearest hopes and most sacred
</p>
<p>interests " like an eternal nightmare ; " if they do not
</p>
<p>wish to have the integrity and morals of the globe para-
</p>
<p>lyzed and palsied by those satanic conspirators, male and
</p>
<p>female, whom Rome trains up and sends forth under the
</p>
<p>name of Jesuits to corrupt the nations, then the system,
</p>
<p>the whole system, must be radically and eternally de-
</p>
<p>stroyed. It has kept no terms with humanity ; humanity
</p>
<p>should keep no terms with it. It has kept no terms with
</p>
<p>God ; and God will assuredly keep no terms with it. It

</p>
<p>blasphemy disappears and is forgotten in comparison
</p>
<p>with the blasphemy of the popes and their insensate
</p>
<p>worshippers. They have not only claimed power as God,
</p>
<p>but above God and against God ; and let the nations be
</p>
<p>assured that he will not hold them guiltless forever.
</p>
<p>The day of his judgment hastens ; it is at hand.
</p>
<p>Yes, humanity shall at length be released from this
</p>
<p>widespread and long-enduring curse. Yes, it shall come
</p>
<p>to pass that the Lord shall give the nations rest from
</p>
<p>their sorrow, and from their fear, and from their hard
</p>
<p>bondage wherein they have been made to serve. Then
</p>
<p>shall they take up this proverb against the King of Baby-
</p>
<p>lon and say, How hath the oppressor ceased, the golden
</p>
<p>city ceased ! The Lord hath broken the staff of the
</p>
<p>wicked, the sceptre of the rulers. He who smote the
</p>
<p>people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the
</p>
<p>nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth. The
</p>
<p>whole earth is at rest and is quiet ; they break forth into
</p>
<p>singing. Hell from beneath is moved to receive her
</p>
<p>own once more and lament over his fall. Then shall it
</p>
<p>be said alike in heaven and on earth, How art thou fallen
</p>
<p>from heaven, Lucifer, son of the morning ! How art
</p>
<p>thou cut down to the ground that didst weaken the na-
</p>
<p>tions ! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend
</p>
<p>into heaven ; I will exalt my throne above the stars of
</p>
<p>God ; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds ; I
</p>
<p>will be like the Most High. Yet thou shalt be brought
</p>
<p>down to hell, to the sides of the pit. They that see thee
</p>
<p>shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee, saying,

<p>Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did
</p>
<p>shake kingdoms ? For I will rise up against him, saith

<p>hosts hatli sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought so
</p>
<p>shall it come to pass ; and as I have purposed, so shall it
</p>
<p>stand. For the Lord of hosts hath purposed; and who
</p>
<p>shall disannul it ? And his hand is stretched out ; and
</p>
<p>who shall turn it back ?
</p>
<p>We should take our views upon this subject from the
</p>
<p>word of God. The destiny of the Romish corporation,
</p>
<p>as there foretold, is not reformation, but destruction. It
</p>
<p>is to be utterly burned with fire ; because God, the aven-
</p>
<p>ging Judge, is almighty. How sublime is yet another
</p>
<p>symbol, by which inspiration foretells this her final
</p>
<p>doom : " A mighty angel took up a stone, like a great
</p>
<p>millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with vio-
</p>
<p>lence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and
</p>
<p>shall be found no more at all " ! How fearfully signifi-
</p>
<p>cant the reasons assigned for this doom : " By her sor-
</p>
<p>ceries were all nations deceived ; with her the kings of the
</p>
<p>earth have committed fornication ; and the inhabitants
</p>
<p>of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her
</p>
<p>fornication. She has been drunken with the blood of the
</p>
<p>saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus ; and in
</p>
<p>her is found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of
</p>
<p>all that were slain on the earth " !
</p>
<p>Hence we need not wonder that in heaven the spirits
</p>
<p>of martyred saints are called on to exult over her doom.
</p>
<p>Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and
</p>
<p>prophets ; for God hath avenged you on her. We need not
</p>
<p>wonder that with loud acclaim they respond to this appeal,
</p>
<p>saying, "Alleluia : salvation, and glory, and hono^and pow-
</p>
<p>er unto the Lord our God ; for true and righteous are his
</p>
<p>judgments ; for he hath judged the great whore which did
</p>
<p>corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the
</p>
<p>blood of his servants at her hand. And again they said,

</p>
<p>Alleluia ; and her smoke rose up forever and ever."
</p>
<p>PROTESTANTISM DEPENDED. 395
</p>
<p>From God's point of vision we can now see what Prot-
</p>
<p>estantism is. It is the beginning of that great work that
</p>
<p>shall issue in this glorious redemption of the human race
</p>
<p>from the bondage of hell, and that shall inaugurate the
</p>
<p>final reign of God in righteousness and truth. The pro-
</p>
<p>cess is simple. The same divine energy that shall so in-
</p>
<p>vigorate the church that she can abhor the worldliness
</p>
<p>and the pollutions of Babylon shall make her so heavenly
</p>
<p>minded and pure that she shall be free from all fanaticism,
</p>
<p>all malignity, all revenge, all diseased emotions, and there-
</p>
<p>fore in the highest possible degree capable of a divine
</p>
<p>boldness and unmitigated hatred of sin, such as the de-
</p>
<p>struction of a system of wickedness so gigantic demands.
</p>
<p>In that system is concentrated the highest energy, the
</p>
<p>whole energy, of Satan. " He gave to it his power, and
</p>
<p>his seat, and great authority." When it is destroyed, his
</p>
<p>fate is decided. The conflict with that system is the
</p>
<p>"Waterloo conflict of the globe.
</p>
<p>Immediately after its decision Satan shall be bound and
</p>
<p>shut up, not in Elba, nor in St. Helena, but in the bottom-
</p>
<p>less pit.
</p>
<p>It is the custom of Romanists to scoff at Protestantism
</p>
<p>because, as yet, it has not completed its work, and has re-
</p>
<p>vealed many imperfections and defects. This is only an-
</p>
<p>other illustration of the unparalleled impudence of that
</p>
<p>system. It had so corrupted society that it has required
</p>
<p>centuries to purge out its corruptions. It had so in-
</p>
<p>wrought the belief of the necessity of some visible head
</p>
<p>to the church on earth into the nations as if God were
</p>
<p>entirely incompetent to take care of his church that
</p>
<p>when the churches of Europe revolted from the pope they
</p>
<p>made kings and emperors their heads. And how could
</p>
<p>the church become pure enough to contend with a concen-

<p>trated system of worldliness and iniquity, so long as she
</p>
<p>396 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>was not a free church, depending upon her true and only
</p>
<p>head for her ministry and for her support ?
</p>
<p>So, too, the dogmatic despotism that has sometimes dis-
</p>
<p>graced and enfeebled Protestantism was but a lesson
</p>
<p>learned in her school, and not yet unlearned.
</p>
<p>The extent to which she debased the conceptions of
</p>
<p>Christendom concerning God, heaven, and hell, and all
</p>
<p>the doctrines of theology, is not even yet fully understood.
</p>
<p>She retained these doctrines in form, but changed God into
</p>
<p>an infinite and almighty demon, delighting in treachery
</p>
<p>and carnage. Her conceptions of heaven, and especially
</p>
<p>of hell, were sensual, material, brutal. A large portion
</p>
<p>of Christendom has not yet recovered from the supersti-
</p>
<p>tious terrors with which she has frozen their minds by her
</p>
<p>profane threats of the wrath of the almighty fiend of
</p>
<p>whom she conceived in the place of a pure and holy God
</p>
<p>of love.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the church of Protestantism has century
</p>
<p>by century worked her way out of the infinite slough of
</p>
<p>pollution into which all things had been cast by the Ro-
</p>
<p>mish harlot ; and the time is near at hand when it shall .be
</p>
<p>given unto her to put on fine linen, clean and white even
</p>
<p>the righteousness of the saints. Then, at length, shall the
</p>
<p>marriage supper of the Lamb come, even on earth. Then
</p>
<p>shall the nations know the difference between the harlot
</p>
<p>of Rome, in her meretricious purple and scarlet attire, and
</p>
<p>the bride, the Lamb's wife, in her fine linen, clean and
</p>
<p>white, in which she shall be publicly owned and acknowl-
</p>
<p>edged by her royal and divine Head.
</p>
<p>Nor have the results of Protestantism even thus far been
</p>
<p>small. It has affected the public sentiment of Christen-
</p>
<p>dom, and even of Rome herself. Rome is not as atheistic
</p>
<p>and profligate as she was before the reformation : she is

</p>
<p>bad enough ; but she is at least outwardly a little more
</p>
<p>PROTESTANTISM DEFENDED. 397
</p>
<p>decent than she once was ; and in all Protestant coun-
</p>
<p>tries some of her clergy are in fact better, and all regard
</p>
<p>appearances a little more than they once did. Let no one,
</p>
<p>however, be simple enough to think that Rome, or her
</p>
<p>clergy, or her monasteries, or nunneries are yet pure. Be-
</p>
<p>yond all doubt, as Gavazzi declares, the abomination of
</p>
<p>desolations still reigns within.
</p>
<p>But the pope's most audacious temporal aggressions have
</p>
<p>been checked and terminated. Kings are not, as once, his
</p>
<p>vassals ; they do not hold his stirrups ; he does not put
</p>
<p>his foot upon their necks.
</p>
<p>The pecuniary traffic of the great corporation, too, has
</p>
<p>to a vast extent been destroyed. True it is that she still
</p>
<p>deludes and swindles hundreds of millions, but not to the
</p>
<p>extent that she once did.
</p>
<p>Protestantism, also, has produced communities in which
</p>
<p>families are safe from the profane intrusion of licentious
</p>
<p>priests into all the secrets of social life by the confessional
</p>
<p>communities intelligent, and educated, and with a mo-
</p>
<p>rality so elevated that the pollutions of Popery seem in-
</p>
<p>conceivable and incredible.
</p>
<p>Protestantism has opened the Bible, and made God,
</p>
<p>through it, the Sun of the moral world, instead of his en-
</p>
<p>emy the pope. It has established systems of popular ed-
</p>
<p>ucation, which Rome fears in this land more than any
</p>
<p>thing except the Bible. It has produced industry, intelli-
</p>
<p>gence, enterprise, thrift, and a striking development of na-
</p>
<p>tional resources wherever it has been permitted thorough-
</p>
<p>ly to unfetter the human mind.
</p>
<p>And last of all, Protestantism, through the Bible, has
</p>
<p>made this great nation, in which, for the first time, the
</p>
<p>great principles of civil and religious liberty have been
</p>
<p>developed on a scale adequate to the wants of humanity.
</p>
<p>The power of these principles, too, is felt and feared even

</p>
<p>CHAPTER IT.
</p>
<p>THE TRUE POSITION OF THE ROMISH BISHOPS RESIDENT
</p>
<p>IN AMERICA.
</p>
<p>IT will be observed that I have not unfrequently used
</p>
<p>an uncommon form of speech in speaking of the bishops
</p>
<p>of the Romish church in this country. I do not speak of
</p>
<p>them as American citizens, or as American bishops, but as
</p>
<p>bishops of Rome sojourning here.
</p>
<p>This language is not without intended significance. I
</p>
<p>do not regard them as in any sense American citizens in
</p>
<p>heart, whatever they may be in profession.
</p>
<p>My reason is this : They are part and parcel of a great
</p>
<p>conspiracy which now exists to subvert the most important
</p>
<p>and fundamental principles of the constitution of these
</p>
<p>United States and of every particular state in this Union.
</p>
<p>I do not make this charge heedlessly, but wittingly, ahd
</p>
<p>with a full understanding of its import. Nor shall I leave
</p>
<p>it unsustained by ample proof ; for, if there is one prin-
</p>
<p>ciple of our national and state constitutions more funda-
</p>
<p>mental than another, it is the great principle of religious
</p>
<p>liberty.
</p>
<p>Now, of this principle the pope has in every variety of
</p>
<p>form declared himself the implacable enemy. When the
</p>
<p>Christian Alliance was formed to extend the principles of
</p>
<p>religious liberty into all lands, Pope Gregory XVL, in an
</p>

<p>400 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.-
</p>
<p>and bishops, issued May 8, 1844, denounced and slandeied
</p>
<p>with the utmost virulence the whole doctrine of religious
</p>
<p>liberty, as hostile to the very fundamental elements of the
</p>
<p>Papacy, as well as of civil despotisms in general. He
</p>
<p>slandered it under the name of " indifference in religion."
</p>
<p>The same pope also, in 1832, declared "that liberty of
</p>
<p>conscience is a most pestilential error," and " that unbridled
</p>
<p>liberty of opinion is THAT PEST OP ALL OTHERS MOST TO BE
</p>
<p>DREADED IN THE STATE." He also denounced " that worst
</p>
<p>and never to be sufficiently EXECRATED AND DETESTED LIB-
</p>
<p>ERTY OF THE PRESS."
</p>
<p>But why should any one be simple enough to wonder at
</p>
<p>all this ? Does any man like to see his own house set on
</p>
<p>fire ? Why, then, should the pope like any better to see
</p>
<p>Babylon the great reduced to ashes, and himself in it?
</p>
<p>The fact is, that the fundamental, constitutional principle of
</p>
<p>this nation is a rejection of the claims of Rome; and this has
</p>
<p>been in all ages regarded and treated as TREASON at Rome.
</p>
<p>The past history and present claims of that corporation
</p>
<p>cannot for a moment be sustained or defended on any
</p>
<p>other ground. On no other ground can they justify their
</p>
<p>inquisitions, and crusades, and massacres.
</p>
<p>The only wonder is that any man can be simple and
</p>
<p>thoughtless enough not to see that there is in fact, and
</p>
<p>from the necessity of the case, a death grapple between
</p>
<p>the two systems. There is no neutrality, no middle
</p>
<p>ground, between them. If one prevails, the other is ex-
</p>
<p>terminated.
</p>
<p>And are the Romish bishops in America at war with
</p>
<p>the pope ? Do they love what he hates and hate what he
</p>
<p>loves? Are they engaged with all their might in build-
</p>
<p>ing up what he is laboring with all his might to throw
</p>
<p>down ? Do they heartily love that which he declares to

<p>ly execrated and detested even the liberty of the
</p>
<p>press ?
</p>
<p>Let it now be remembered that their code of morals,
</p>
<p>though it justifies perjury towards heretics, will not tol-
</p>
<p>erate perjury towards the pope. What, then, have they
</p>
<p>sworn to do in their peculiar and anti-republican feudal
</p>
<p>oath ? To say nothing of the oath to persecute and wage
</p>
<p>war with heretics, about which they make contemptible
</p>
<p>and Jesuitical quibbles to cover up its obvious meaning,
</p>
<p>have they not sworn to obey the pope's mandates and de-
</p>
<p>crees ? And what is this but an oath to obey the most
</p>
<p>infamous persecuting enactments of the canon law ?
</p>
<p>According to their own principles, then, are they not
</p>
<p>guilty of treason to the constitution of these United
</p>
<p>States treason not in any declamatory sense, but in
</p>
<p>strict and legal verity ?
</p>
<p>For if the claim of liberty of conscience was in the

<p>case of John Huss treason, as at war with the constitu-
</p>
<p>tion of Rome, if they burned him for it at the stake, and
</p>
<p>if they have slaughtered millions before and since for the
</p>
<p>same crime, then why is it not treason for the Romish
</p>
<p>bishops in America to conspire with the pope and foreign
</p>
<p>potentates to overthrow the fundamental principle of our
</p>
<p>national constitution ?
</p>
<p>Let us consider a few facts on this point. In the year
</p>
<p>1828, F. Schlegel, a Romanist, delivered in Vienna a
</p>
<p>course of lectures against Protestantism, and in favor of
</p>
<p>Popery, as adapted to sustain the existing civil despotisms
</p>
<p>of Europe. In those lectures he thus speaks of this coun-
</p>
<p>try : " The true nursery of all these destructive princi-
</p>
<p>ples, the revolutionary school for France and the rest
</p>
<p>of Europe, has been Xorth America. Thence the evil has
</p>
<p>spread over many other lands, either by natural contagion
</p>
<p>or by arbitrary communication." Hereupon the St. Leo-

<p>402 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>pold foundation was set on foot, for the purpose of sup-
</p>
<p>porting, in their own words, " the greater activity of Catho-
</p>
<p>lic missions in the United States" This Schlegel was one
</p>
<p>of the Austrian cabinet, the confidential counsellor of
</p>
<p>Prince Metternich. This society was received under roy-
</p>
<p>al protection and sanctioned by the pope. It prepares in
</p>
<p>the seminary of Vienna, and supports a body of Jesuits
</p>
<p>who are pervading this country. The pope issued a bull
</p>
<p>promising full indulgence and remission of all their sins
</p>
<p>to those who should contribute to the society. This bull
</p>
<p>was made perpetual and sanctioned by the emperor. The
</p>
<p>tenth article provides that masses shall be said for the
</p>
<p>souls of all contributors after their death.
</p>
<p>Seven days after this bull, Prince Metternich wrote to
</p>
<p>the Bishop of Cincinnati, who when in Austria had pub-
</p>
<p>lished a pamphlet on the state of the western country,
</p>
<p>which was one of the influences leading to the formation
</p>
<p>of the society, stating the joy with which the emperor
</p>
<p>cooperated in the plan of the society.
</p>
<p>What have we here, then ? Is this any thing but a for-
</p>
<p>mal and avowed plot to subvert our institutions, in which
</p>
<p>the Romish Bishop of Cincinnati conspires with the pope
</p>
<p>and the Emperor of Austria ?
</p>
<p>Consider another fact. The society at Lyons, in France,
</p>
<p>from whose address to its patrons I have given an extract
</p>
<p>on page 17, insults the Protestant settlers of this coun-
</p>
<p>try, laments that Protestantism had gained the ascen-
</p>
<p>dency here, and declares that " the Catholic church could
</p>
<p>never abandon the invaded territory" and encourages the
</p>
<p>hope of its speedy recovery. For twenty-two years this
</p>
<p>society has been sending money to all the bishops of this
</p>
<p>nation. From their own reports, it appears that in the
</p>
<p>four years from 1839 to 1843 it sent the enormous sum of

<p>six dollars. This society, though a general missionary
</p>
<p>society, was formed with special reference to us, and has
</p>
<p>sent to us more money than to any other great division
</p>
<p>of the globe.
</p>
<p>Once more : the English Romanists formed an emigra-
</p>
<p>tion society designed to establish colonies of Romanists
</p>
<p>under their priests in the great North-Western States.
</p>
<p>Of this a full account is given by H. Norton in his Signs
</p>
<p>of Danger and of Promise, and in his Startling Facts,
</p>
<p>pp. 28-37. It is simply a consistent part of one great
</p>
<p>plan. On it Norton remarks,
</p>
<p>" It may suffice to say that the policy of the society
</p>
<p>is to imbody the Papal population together in the west,
</p>
<p>remote from Protestant influence. It aims at throwing a
</p>
<p>majority into the great valley, and thus to control the des-
</p>
<p>tiny of the United States.
</p>
<p>" They are very confident of success, as appears by this
</p>
<p>document. The energy of hope is apparent on every
</p>
<p>page. Yes, they hope ; they confidently anticipate the day
</p>
<p>when the religion and the government of the United
</p>
<p>States will be Roman Catholic.
</p>
<p>" Hear this, ye Protestants who never dream of danger,
</p>
<p>who imagine that such a thought could have danced only
</p>
<p>in the brain of a lunatic ! Read attentively a few quota-
</p>
<p>tions from this pamphlet, written by a Roman Catholic
</p>
<p>gentleman :
</p>
<p>" ' Judge Haliburton asserts that all America will be a
</p>
<p>Catholic country.' ' The Roman Catholic church bids
</p>
<p>fair to rise to importance in America.'
</p>
<p>" ' They gain constantly ; they gain more by emigration,
</p>
<p>more by natural increase in proportion to their numbers,
</p>
<p>more by intermarriages, adoption, and conversion, than
</p>
<p>Protestants. With their exclusive views of salvation
</p>
<p>and peculiar tenets, as soon as they have the majority

</p>
<p>this becomes a Catholic country, with a Catholic govern-
</p>
<p>ment, with the Catholic religion established by law. Is
</p>
<p>this a great change ? A greater change has taken place

</p>
<p>among the British, the Medes and Persians of Europe, the
</p>
<p>nolumus leges mutari people.'
</p>
<p>" Towards the close of this document is the following
</p>
<p>sentence in capitals :
</p>
<p>" ' The cooperation of other European nations in pro-
</p>
<p>moting the objects of the society is most desirable, par-
</p>
<p>ticularly of those possessing a redundant population
</p>
<p>that is, Roman Catholic, &c. }
</p>
<p>" This observation is especially applicable to Belgium,
</p>
<p>France, and a large portion of Germany. They speak of
</p>
<p>those nations as follows :
</p>
<p>" ' The western districts may be said to have a particu-
</p>
<p>lar claim to the patronage of France, as it was under
</p>
<p>their former sovereignty that their vast resources and fa-
</p>
<p>cility of connection between the northern lakes and the
</p>
<p>first navigable tributaries of the Mississippi were discov-
</p>
<p>ered by those enterprising and amiable French Jesuit
</p>
<p>missionaries, Henepin and La Salle. As to Belgium and
</p>
<p>Germany, it is almost needless to call on them for greater
</p>
<p>support than is already furnished by the mass of Catholic
</p>
<p>population daily flowing from these kingdoms into the
</p>
<p>fertile west.
</p>
<p>' ' In proof of this, St. Louis, risen up as it were but
</p>
<p>yesterday in the heart of this country, now boasts of
</p>
<p>more than thirty thousand inhabitants, twelve thousand
</p>
<p>of which are German, Belgian, French, and Irish Catho-
</p>
<p>lics, mainly attracted by the system of education afforded
</p>
<p>by the Belgian Jesuits, who have not only been the means
</p>
<p>of establishing a magnificent cathedral in this city, and
</p>
<p>also a college now classed so high in affording instruction,
</p>
<p>that, beyond the commendations universally bestowed on
</p>
<p>its internal arrangements, its rules may be almost said to
</p>
<p>hold out the best model for diffusing general knowledge
</p>
<p>through the west.' 71

<p>population of Europe. They will go over with foreign
</p>
<p>views and feelings, and will form a heterogeneous mass,
</p>
<p>and in the course of time will be prepared to rise and
</p>
<p>subvert the government." He then adds, " The church
</p>
<p>of Rome has a design upon that country. Popery will in
</p>
<p>time be the established religion, and will aid in the de-
</p>
<p>struction of that republic. I have conversed with many
</p>
<p>of the sovereigns and princes of Europe ; and they have
</p>
<p>unanimously expressed their opinions relative to the gov-
</p>
<p>ernment of the United States, and their determination to
</p>
<p>subvert it." (See Norton's Signs of Danger, p. 16.)
</p>
<p>In connection with these proceedings of foreign organ-
</p>
<p>izations in cooperation with the Romish bishops in this
</p>
<p>country, note also the fact that the Catholic Telegraph,
</p>
<p>of Cincinnati, under the supervision and censorship of the
</p>
<p>bishop, openly published a condemnation of our American
</p>
<p>institutions, as " not of a nature to invite the reflecting
</p>
<p>part of the world." This was said in view of a single
</p>
<p>fact in a trial in Boston after the burning of the Charles-
</p>
<p>town nunnery. Concerning this he says, " This one fact is
</p>
<p>a condemnation of the system of American institutions, con-
</p>
<p>firmed lately by numerous other proofs"
</p>
<p>Bishop England, a Jesuit, on his return from Europe
</p>
<p>said, in an address to his diocese, " In Paris and at Lyons
</p>
<p>I have conversed with those excellent men who manage
</p>
<p>the affairs of the Association for propagating the Faith.
</p>
<p>I have also had opportunities of communication with some
</p>
<p>of the council which administers the Austrian Association.
</p>
<p>The Propaganda in Rome has this year contributed to our
</p>
<p>extraordinary expenditure, as has the holy father himself."
</p>
<p>A few years since the Association for propagating the
</p>
<p>Faith stated their conviction that within thirty years the
</p>
<p>Romanists would have the ascendency in this country.

</p>
<p>What would be the state of things in that contingency,
</p>
<p>406 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>learn from the Shepherd of the Valley, the organ of the
</p>
<p>Bishop of St. Louis : " The church is of necessity intol-
</p>
<p>erant. Heresy she endures when and where she must ; but
</p>
<p>she hates it, and directs all her energies to its destruction.
</p>
<p>If Catholics ever gain an immense numerical majority, re-
</p>
<p>ligious freedom in this country is at an end. So our en-
</p>
<p>emies say ; so we believe." November 23, 1851. (See
</p>
<p>supra, p. 107.)
</p>
<p>The propriety of this course is thus defended by Mr.
</p>
<p>Brownson : " The liberty of heresy and unbelief is not a
</p>
<p>natural right. * * * All the rights the sects have, or
</p>
<p>can have, are derived from the state, and rest on expedi-
</p>
<p>ency. As they have in their character of sects, hostile to
</p>
<p>the true religion, (Popery,) no rights under the law of Na-
</p>
<p>ture or the law of God, they are neither wronged nor
</p>
<p>deprived of liberty if the state refuses to grant them any
</p>
<p>rights at all." Brownson's Review, October, 1852, p. 456.
</p>
<p>Mr. Brownson says he writes nothing without the sanc-
</p>
<p>tion of his bishop ; and the Romish hierarchy in this coun-
</p>
<p>try indorse his work. Of course, as soon as the Romanists
</p>
<p>gain the majority, the rights of all Protestants will be at
</p>
<p>an end.
</p>
<p>Such is the conduct of these bishops towards what they
</p>
<p>treacherously call their country. Is this their idea of true
</p>
<p>allegiance ? Do they swear no other allegiance than this
</p>
<p>to the pope ? Mark well the words of their oath : " I will
</p>
<p>not be in any counsel, action, or treaty in which shall be
</p>
<p>plotted against our said lord and the said Romish church
</p>
<p>any thing to the hurt or prejudice of their persons, right,
</p>
<p>honor, state, or power ; and, if I shall know any such thing
</p>
<p>to be treated or agitated by any whatsoever, I will hinder
</p>
<p>it to my power, and as soon as I can will signify it to our
</p>
<p>said lord, or to some other by whom it may come to his

</p>
<p>institutions they swear to regard as thus sacred. Against
</p>
<p>him they swear not to plot : him they swear to warn of
</p>
<p>danger.
</p>
<p>But, when he with foreign despots leagues against us,
</p>
<p>they take sweet counsel together with them, receive their
</p>
<p>funds, and carry out their purposes. Nor is this all : they
</p>
<p>are sworn to go or to send a trusty messenger every third
</p>
<p>year to the centre of this great conspiracy, and to give a
</p>
<p>strict account of their fidelity in all their proceedings to
</p>
<p>their lord the pope.
</p>
<p>And now, if all this is not treason, what is ? But it may
</p>
<p>be asked, What will the Komish bishops say to this charge?
</p>
<p>That depends altogether upon their locality and audience.
</p>
<p>At Rome, Lyons, or Vienna, and before their fellow-con-
</p>
<p>spirators they will say, " It is true ; and we glory in it."
</p>
<p>Moreover they will sneer, and not without reason, at the
</p>
<p>simplicity of any among us who ever have been hood-
</p>
<p>winked by their old tricks of Romish perjury, in swearing
</p>
<p>mock oaths of allegiance to a government which is re-
</p>
<p>garded at Rome as guilty of treason and deserving of
</p>
<p>damnation, because Protestant and founded on the prin-
</p>
<p>ciples of religious liberty. Let no one say this is not
</p>
<p>charitable. True charity does not consist in stultifying
</p>
<p>ourselves and forswearing common sense. The very re-
</p>
<p>ligion of these men enjoins and canonizes fraud and per-
</p>
<p>jury towards heretics, and robbery and murder also, when
</p>
<p>they have the power : all history proves this. Will they,
</p>
<p>then, be better than their religion ?
</p>
<p>When, rny countrymen, will you thoroughly under-
</p>
<p>stand and firmly believe that the Romish bishops among
</p>
<p>us mean to be faithful to their oath to the pope, and that
</p>
<p>fidelity to the pope and church of Rome is, of necessity,
</p>
<p>enmity and treachery to the highest interests of this

</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.
</p>
<p>APPEAL TO THE JUDGMENT OF GOD.
</p>
<p>I HAVE already appealed to every truehearted Amer-
</p>
<p>ican for a righteous judgment in the great case before us.
</p>
<p>It is with joy that I now turn to the judgment seat of
</p>
<p>God. I turn with joy, because he is not burdened, wearied,
</p>
<p>or depressed even by a cause so vast as this. When be-
</p>
<p>neath its magnitude my mind faints and fails, I turn with
</p>
<p>joy to him, the unfain ting, the unfailing, the all-comprehend-
</p>
<p>ing, the omnipresent God, the Lord of all power and might,
</p>
<p>glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders.
</p>
<p>Before his judgment seat I bow ; to him I present my
</p>
<p>cause for judgment.
</p>
<p>To him and to his holy angels I appeal that I have not
</p>
<p>sought or provoked this warfare with the Romish corpo-
</p>
<p>ration. To him I appeal that it has been with deep sor-
</p>
<p>row, and not with joy, that I have made the severe charges
</p>
<p>against them which stand upon my pages awaiting his
</p>
<p>judgment. Before him I confess that I am sacredly bound
</p>
<p>by the highest obligations of truth and justice in dealing
</p>
<p>with their characters, reputation, and interests.
</p>
<p>But I found them grossly assailing all that is most
</p>
<p>dear to myself, my friends, my country, and my God.
</p>
<p>What truehearted American does not love and revere the
</p>
<p>Pilgrim Fathers and all the other noble Protestant found-
</p>
<p>ers of this nation, to whose piety, toil, and blood we owe

</p>
<p>all our present blessings ? Yet I found this corporation
</p>
<p>defaming these men as violent, restless heretics ; as the
</p>
<p>mere scum of sects and as the invaders of their terri-
</p>
<p>tory. What patriotic American does not love the insti-
</p>
<p>tutions of this country, based on religious freedom and
</p>
<p>consecrated to the glory of God and the welfare of man ?
</p>
<p>Yet I found them leagued with foreign despots for the
</p>
<p>subversion and destruction of these sacred institutions.
</p>
<p>Who does not love those pure and holy spirits who, for
</p>
<p>their love to God and to his word, have endured tortures
</p>
<p>lingering and unutterable in the dungeons of this corpo-
</p>
<p>ration, or have been suddenly and ruthlessly slain by their
</p>
<p>fierce crusaders, or burned in their funeral piles? God
</p>
<p>loves them, with whom they now are ; he has treasured up
</p>
<p>their tears ; he will make inquisition for their blood. Yet
</p>
<p>I found this corporation still defaming their character by
</p>
<p>atrocious slanders, justifying their murder, and exalting
</p>
<p>with honor the bloodstained authors of their death.
</p>
<p>Who does not regard with deep and tender interest the
</p>
<p>welfare of his children, and of their children, and of all
</p>
<p>the coming generations of this great country? Yet I
</p>
<p>found that bloody corporation straining every nerve to
</p>
<p>destroy those great and blood-bought principles that now
</p>
<p>defend us in the free and intelligent worship of God, and
</p>
<p>to prepare the way for endless proscriptions and slaugh-
</p>
<p>ters such as have covered their career in the old world
</p>
<p>with deep and endless infamy.
</p>
<p>Who does not love the free schools of this nation, con-
</p>
<p>secrated to God and to liberty, in which prayer daily as-
</p>
<p>cends and the word of God is read ? Yet I found this
</p>
<p>slanderous corporation assailing these as infidel and god-
</p>
<p>less schools, and rallying all their myrmidons for their
</p>
<p>destruction.

</p>
<p>olent, energetic, pure Protestant Christians of this land,
</p>
<p>expending time, labor, and wealth in sustaining the in-
</p>
<p>stitutions of religion and education, relieving human suffer-
</p>
<p>ing and want, elevating society, and sending forth the
</p>
<p>heralds of salvation to all climes ? Yet I found this fero-
</p>
<p>cious and bloody corporation reviling them as pagans,
</p>
<p>and thus pouring scorn and contempt upon God himself
</p>
<p>by scoffing at and slandering some of the most glorious
</p>
<p>results of his regenerating grace.
</p>
<p>And, as if this were not enough, I found the same un-
</p>
<p>holy and licentious corporation arrogating to itself all the
</p>
<p>holiness of earth and an entire and irrevocable monopoly
</p>
<p>of the grace of God.
</p>
<p>Still more : I found this arrogant corporation stigma-
</p>
<p>tizing as persecution all attempts to repel such a murder-
</p>
<p>ous onset on all that man holds dear, and claiming, under
</p>
<p>the shield of our principles of religious liberty, the right
</p>
<p>to conspire and combine with the despots of the old world
</p>
<p>to destroy the very principles that gave them shelter and
</p>
<p>defence ; declaring that the children of the founders of
</p>
<p>these institutions, as heretics, have no rights, but that this
</p>
<p>same immaculate corporation has the entire monopoly of
</p>
<p>rights in this world, as well as of holiness and the grace
</p>
<p>of God. They claim that God has given to them the ab-
</p>
<p>solute and exclusive right to persecute, and that to restrain
</p>
<p>them from the free exercise of this right is persecution
</p>
<p>and an invasion of their inalienable^ rights. Moreover to
</p>
<p>write or to say any thing against them is impious slander,
</p>
<p>deserving the torments of the Inquisition and the stake ;
</p>
<p>for they, and they only, are infallible ; they fill the place
</p>
<p>of God on earth.
</p>
<p>"Who, then, is the assailant ? Who is the invader ? Let
</p>
<p>God judge. No doubt he will judge. He knows that
</p>

<p>And now I well know that I am no match for the in-
</p>
<p>APPEAL TO THE JUDGMENT OP GOD. 411 .
</p>
<p>tensity of the wickedness of this widespread corporation.
</p>
<p>No human power is adequate for such a crisis. God alone
</p>
<p>is almighty ; he alone can meet it ; and to him I turn with
</p>
<p>exulting confidence and hope.
</p>
<p>Before him and his holy angels and the hosts of the
</p>
<p>redeemed, as well as before men, I present those charges
</p>
<p>against this corporation, for which I am ready to give an
</p>
<p>account before the bar of my final Judge. I have not made
</p>
<p>these charges in the language of passion or exaggeration,
</p>
<p>but of sober conviction.
</p>
<p>I have declared, and do declare, that without the slight-
</p>
<p>est authority or pretext it has impiously arrogated to
</p>
<p>itself the place of God, and given the sanction of his
</p>
<p>holy name to deeds and principles which he abhors ; that
</p>
<p>its whole energy has been put forth to corrupt the prin-
</p>
<p>ciples and debauch the morals of mankind ; that it has
</p>
<p>been the great teacher of fraud, perfidy, perjury, and
</p>
<p>murder ; that it has deluged the nations with the blood
</p>
<p>of the saints ; that by its great engines of despotism,
</p>
<p>the confessional and the celibacy of the clergy, it has
</p>
<p>debauched the whole body of its ecclesiastics and rad-
</p>
<p>ically corrupted and enslaved human society ; that it is at
</p>
<p>war with all the interests of humanity ; that forgery and
</p>
<p>frauds of the most atrocious kind are the basis of its pow-
</p>
<p>er ; that therefore it cannot live except by the destruction
</p>
<p>of history and the Bible, and therefore it remorselessly
</p>
<p>wars upon both of them ; that those of the corporation
</p>
<p>who reside among us are engaged in a traitorous con-
</p>
<p>spiracy to resist the cause of God by the subversion of re-
</p>
<p>ligious liberty in this nation, and throughout the world,
</p>
<p>in order again to deluge the nations with blood.
</p>
<p>Before God I thus charge them ; and I put upon them
</p>
<p>the guilt of the blood of his martyred saints, and invoke
</p>
<p>him to hear their prayers for judgment and to destroy

<p>CHAPTER VI.
</p>
<p>WHAT SHALL BE DONE?
</p>
<p>THE very nature of this work reveals the fact that it
</p>
<p>was not written for purposes of theory, but for a practi-
</p>
<p>cal end. In every crisis the great question is, What shall
</p>
<p>be done?
</p>
<p>To answer this question, I would say to my fellow-cit-
</p>
<p>izens, Consider first who you are, where you are, and what
</p>
<p>God expects of you. You are God's jurors, in behalf of
</p>
<p>your country and of humanity, in the great question now
</p>
<p>before the bar of God. You are in the age of light, and
</p>
<p>not in the dark ages of forgery and fraud ; not indeed,
</p>
<p>as yet, in the age of perfect light, but destined soon to
</p>
<p>become so. It is to be the age of true and impartial his-
</p>
<p>tory ; it is to be an historical day of judgment for the globe.
</p>
<p>God expects of you, therefore, a true judgment in view of
</p>
<p>the law and of the facts in the case.
</p>
<p>The law is obvious, alike by nature and by revelation.
</p>
<p>It is the great law of universal and reciprocal benevolence
</p>
<p>to God and to man. It is the law of truth, of honor, of
</p>
<p>justice, of love. It gives to God his rights in all men, and
</p>
<p>to all men their rights in God.
</p>
<p>Is it not plain, then, that the first great work to be done
</p>
<p>is to understand the facts of the case to know certain-
</p>
<p>ly what this Papal corporation is to know its origin,
</p>
<p>its principles, its laws, its history, its deeds to strip off

</p>
<p>all its disguises, all its manifold robes of concealment, all
</p>
<p>its false pretences and religious cant, and to compel it to
</p>
<p>stand naked in the light of God's own truth before his
</p>
<p>judgment bar?
</p>
<p>The next thing to be done is to demolish Popish de-
</p>
<p>fences derived from the doctrine of rights of conscience.
</p>
<p>The Romish bill of rights is, that their corporation has a
</p>
<p>divine right to follow a conscience that impels them to
</p>
<p>persecute and murder all who will not give up intellect,
</p>
<p>conscience, property, wives, and daughters to their godless
</p>
<p>ambition and lust. This theory is to be exposed to the
</p>
<p>abhorrence it deserves, as an arrogant and diabolical in-
</p>
<p>vasion of all the rights of God and man.
</p>
<p>We are also to expose those defenders of the Romish
</p>
<p>church who raise the cry of persecution against those who
</p>
<p>boldly reveal her crimes. Her bill of rights on this point
</p>
<p>is, that she has from God the exclusive right to persecute
</p>
<p>all over the globe all who refuse to obey her imperious
</p>
<p>mandates ; and, if any man dares to peep or mutter against
</p>
<p>her for her butcheries, that she is unjustly persecuted for
</p>
<p>righteousness' sake. Mr. Brownson is fast assuming this
</p>
<p>ground, and is very piously consoling the gentle popes that,
</p>
<p>like Christ, they are persecuted for righteousness' sake.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the true and only way of destroying
</p>
<p>persecution from the globe is utterly to destroy that cor-
</p>
<p>poration which, as claiming infallibility, has enjoined per-
</p>
<p>secution against all heretics by unchangeable law ; which
</p>
<p>has repeatedly deluged in blood the nations of Europe by
</p>
<p>massacres the most atrocious and by the torments and fires
</p>
<p>of the Inquisition ; which still justifies these massacres, and
</p>
<p>declares her purpose to prepare the way for the repetition
</p>
<p>of them in this land upon our children, and children's
</p>
<p>children, and all coming generations. Whatever perse-
</p>
<p>cution is, it is not persecution to aim at the utter destruc-

<p>-414 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>tion of a corporation like this ; not, indeed, on the ac-
</p>
<p>cursed principles of that corporation by perjury and vio-
</p>
<p>lence, but by a public sentiment formed by God and the
</p>
<p>truth, so pure and powerful that it shall reduce it to ashes
</p>
<p>beneath the soles of our feet.
</p>
<p>If then these, the true principles of the case, were
</p>
<p>thoroughly understood, and if all American freemen were
</p>
<p>thoroughly acquainted with the real facts of the case, all
</p>
<p>else would follow of course.
</p>
<p>I say this because eighteen millions of free American
</p>
<p>Protestants can with perfect ease, if enlightened and full
</p>
<p>of moral energy, form a public sentiment, with the aid of
</p>
<p>God, that shall not only do the needed work for our coun-
</p>
<p>try, but also impart new energy to the friends of freedom
</p>
<p>in the old world. Romanism, as ought to be known to
</p>
<p>all, is plotting, not only our downfall, but also that of
</p>
<p>Great Britain, and is confidently expecting both. But, if
</p>
<p>united, intelligent, bold, and energetic, we can with per-
</p>
<p>fect ease defend ourselves, aid our brethren in the old
</p>
<p>world in their struggles, and turn the tide of war to the
</p>
<p>gates of Rome.
</p>
<p>These views involve no hostility to the masses of the
</p>
<p>Romanists in this country or in the old world ; nay, they
</p>
<p>involve love and sympathy for them, and an earnest desire
</p>
<p>to destroy that corporation which is their worst enemy, and
</p>
<p>which is intent only on deluding, enslaving, and plunder-
</p>
<p>ing them. Mr. Brownson testifies that he found multi-
</p>
<p>tudes of Romanists in this country disposed to adopt and
</p>
<p>defend the true principles of religious liberty, and is now,
</p>
<p>with the pope, straining every nerve to prevent such a re-
</p>
<p>sult. We ought not, indeed, to confide political trusts even
</p>
<p>to liberal Romanists till they have renounced all allegiance
</p>
<p>to the persecuting despotism of Rome a despotism which

</p>
<p>even now is ready to persecute them just as it persecutes
</p>
<p>WHAT SHALL BE DONE? 415
</p>
<p>Meagher for his love of true liberty. But we can treat
</p>
<p>all such with the utmost kindness, and do all in our power
</p>
<p>to hasten their emancipation. What the world needs is,
</p>
<p>that God should smite the Romish corporation itself on
</p>
<p>the brain with an omnipotent energy that shall at once
</p>
<p>destroy its life. "When he shall at last do this, when the
</p>
<p>struggles of the monster shall be over and it shall be
</p>
<p>stretched out dead upon the plains, then will it be easy to
</p>
<p>break the chains of its captives and bid them go free ;
</p>
<p>then will shouts of triumph go up from an emancipated
</p>
<p>world.
</p>
<p>Whilst I thus place my main dependence upon the pow-
</p>
<p>er of God, acting through an enlightened and energetic
</p>
<p>public sentiment, I would not exclude the proper use of
</p>
<p>legislation. In particular, we ought to have such legisla-
</p>
<p>tion as shall render it impossible for the pope and his
</p>
<p>agents to accumulate real estate in this country, to the in-
</p>
<p>jury of the nation and the detriment of liberty. All na-
</p>
<p>tions, even the most Papal, have been compelled by the
</p>
<p>steady and persevering rapacity of the pope and his agents
</p>
<p>to defend themselves against him by law. The English
</p>
<p>statutes of mortmain were designed for this end.
</p>
<p>On this point Blackstone says, " Another engine set on
</p>
<p>foot, or at least greatly improved, by the court of Rome,
</p>
<p>was a masterpiece of Papal policy. Not content with the
</p>
<p>ample provision of tithes which the law of the land had
</p>
<p>given to the parochial clergy, they endeavored to grasp
</p>
<p>at all the lands and inheritances of the kingdom, and,
</p>
<p>had not the legislature withstood them, would by this time
</p>
<p>have probably been masters of every foot of ground in the
</p>
<p>kingdom.'' He then details their ingenious and systematic
</p>
<p>contrivances to effect it and to evade the laws. All his
</p>
<p>discussion of this point deserves careful consideration at

</p>
<p>this time. And now, is it not time to ask, What right has
</p>
<p>416 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>the pope to claim, through his pecuniary emissaries called
</p>
<p>bishops, the right to hold directly or indirectly all the
</p>
<p>church property of the Romish denomination in this coun-
</p>
<p>try. This is not merely a question for the corporation of
</p>
<p>the St. Louis church in Buffalo to consider ; it is a ques-
</p>
<p>tion for the nation. Is it nothing to us that three millions
</p>
<p>of Americans are thus enslaved to the pope by his abso-
</p>
<p>lute possession and control of all their church property ?
</p>
<p>Do we desire to give him. the utmost possible power orer
</p>
<p>them, and to remove them as far as possible from conform-
</p>
<p>ity to our institutions and susceptibility to their influence ?
</p>
<p>Shall we allow the worst enemy of this nation to exert
</p>
<p>against us a power so vast?
</p>
<p>Sooner than to allow this, and if it cannot be other-
</p>
<p>wise prevented, every title held by the pope, or any bishop,
</p>
<p>Jesuit, or priest of his, should be annulled by law, and the
</p>
<p>property confiscated, unless the church to which it belongs
</p>
<p>wift hold it for themselves by a board of lay trustees like
</p>
<p>those of the St. Louis church.
</p>
<p>In all this there is no intolerance ; it is simple common
</p>
<p>sense. Why should we play into the hands of the great
</p>
<p>conspiracy against our institutions, of which the pope, the
</p>
<p>Emperor of Austria, and Metternich are the mainsprings ?
</p>
<p>Moreover, it is time that the amount and condition of all
</p>
<p>the property of every kind owned or controlled by the
</p>
<p>pope, through his agents, in this country were thoroughly
</p>
<p>understood.
</p>
<p>Once more : it is the duty of American citizens to re-
</p>
<p>move from all editors of newspapers and all politicians all
</p>
<p>temptation to play into the hands of the pope or his bish-
</p>
<p>ops. If we are faithful to ourselves, we may be sure that
</p>
<p>they will be faithful to us. They will not pay court to
</p>
<p>the rulers of three millions of Romanists, if, by so doing,

</p>
<p>they are sure to lose the favor of eighteen millions of
</p>
<p>WHAT SHALL BE DONE? 417
</p>
<p>Protestants. We owe it to ourselves, to our country, and
</p>
<p>to the world to strengthen, embolden, and sustain them in
</p>
<p>the discharge of their duties as Protestants. As soon as
</p>
<p>all American citizens shall view with proper indignation
</p>
<p>the Romish emissaries, called bishops,who reside in America,
</p>
<p>their lordly titles, and gaudy robes, and pious cant will avail
</p>
<p>them little in their efforts to enslave Protestant politicians
</p>
<p>and the Protestant press. The entire emancipation of the
</p>
<p>press, then, and of politics, from Romish influence and in-
</p>
<p>trigue, is an object the importance of which no mind can
</p>
<p>estimate. This emancipation the people can effect simply
</p>
<p>by acting as Protestants ; and they must take the work
</p>
<p>into their own hands. When this work shall have been
</p>
<p>effected, when we shall have an all-pervading, free, bold,
</p>
<p>independent, intelligent Protestant press, then the Romish
</p>
<p>bishops among us may retire as soon as they please into
</p>
<p>the obscure shades of private life. But if Protestants will
</p>
<p>not be faithful to their own principles, if for inferior party
</p>
<p>ends they will sacrifice religious liberty, free schools, and
</p>
<p>the property and lives of all coming generations, then let
</p>
<p>them not make editors and politicians the scapegoat on
</p>
<p>which to place the sin of the ruin of this nation. I do
</p>
<p>not hold editors or politicians guiltless if they yield to
</p>
<p>temptation ; God and his country ought to be to every
</p>
<p>Protestant dearer than life. Neither, on the other hand,
</p>
<p>do I excuse the people, if, having the power to invigorate
</p>
<p>and embolden editors and politicians in the path of duty,
</p>
<p>they fail to put it forth.
</p>
<p>Our enemies glory in our divisions ; by them they de-
</p>
<p>clare boastingly that they shall prevail over us. Let us
</p>
<p>show them that freemen can be united by noble principles,
</p>
<p>by the love of God, of our country, of freedom, of human-
</p>
<p>ity, more closely than the vassals of superstition by terror

<p>418 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>Look well into the question of monasteries and nunne-
</p>
<p>ries ; there is no doubt that they are a curse to the nation.
</p>
<p>Nunneries are prisons of deluded and hopeless victims.
</p>
<p>Romish public sentiment and force imprison them. Unmar-
</p>
<p>ried men have the charge of unmarried women, and hear
</p>
<p>them confess in these secret abodes. Need more be said ?
</p>
<p>Even Catholic Spain was compelled to break up the whole
</p>
<p>system because of its abominable profligacy. The united
</p>
<p>testimony of all ages is against it, as I have already shown
</p>
<p>by abundant proof. Shall this root of abominations, then,
</p>
<p>be allowed to spread far and wide, and by its pestilential
</p>
<p>influences blast society on every side ?
</p>
<p>I ask your particular attention to the pernicious influ-
</p>
<p>ence of Romanism on the morals of the community in this
</p>
<p>respect, that you may learn to what a depth of immorality
</p>
<p>and vice this country would be plunged if Popery should
</p>
<p>prevail. By the returns laid before Parliament, it appears
</p>
<p>that in London the proportion of illegitimate births is four
</p>
<p>per cent. ; in Paris it is thirty-three ; in Brussels thirty-six;
</p>
<p>in Munich twenty-five ; in Vienna fifty-one per cent. The
</p>
<p>amount of immorality thus manifested is a hundred fold
</p>
<p>greater in some Romish parts of Europe than in any part
</p>
<p>of Protestant England. In Rome, the city of popes, car-
</p>
<p>dinals, archbishops, bishops, priests, monks, and nuns, they
</p>
<p>dare not make returns. But one fact speaks for itself :
</p>
<p>The number of births in Rome, by Dr. Bowring's returns,
</p>
<p>is four thousand three hundred and odd per annum ; and,
</p>
<p>by the returns of Mittermeyer, the number of foundlings
</p>
<p>in the diiferent foundling institutions in Rome, during a
</p>
<p>period of ten years, gives a return of three thousand one
</p>
<p>hundred and sixty per annum. Hobart Seymour, from
</p>
<p>whom I take these statistics, says, "All this certainly
</p>
<p>speaks very strongly of the immorality of Rome, or de-

</p>
<p>clares that, if the mothers be married mothers, they are
</p>
<p>WHAT SHALL BE DONE? 419
</p>
<p>the most unnatural mothers in the world." An examina-
</p>
<p>tion by Mr. Seymour of the official and governmental re-
</p>
<p>turns of every Roman Catholic country in Europe, in fif-
</p>
<p>teen or twenty folio volumes, enabled him to say that
</p>
<p>Popery is universally the mother of vice and crime. Thus
</p>
<p>in England the ratio of murders, during ten years, was
</p>
<p>four to a million ; during the same time in Ireland it was
</p>
<p>forty-five to a million per annum, and in the most favora-
</p>
<p>ble years never less than nineteen to a million. In Bel-
</p>
<p>gium, one of the best Romish countries, the murders are
</p>
<p>eighteen to a million ; in France thirty-one to a million ;
</p>
<p>in Austria, the great pillar of Popery, thirty-six to a mil-
</p>
<p>lion ; in Bavaria, a Romish state, including homicides,
</p>
<p>sixty-eight persons to a million excluding homicides,
</p>
<p>thirty to a million ; in Italy, in the Venetian and Milan-
</p>
<p>ese provinces, forty-five to a million ; in Tuscany forty-two
</p>
<p>to a million ; in the States of the Pope one hundred to a
</p>
<p>million ; in Sicily ninety to a million ; in Naples, doubly
</p>
<p>cursed by Popery and the most immitigable Popish civil
</p>
<p>despotism, two hundred to a million. The average of all
</p>
<p>these Papal nations is seventy-five to a million. "In
</p>
<p>Italy," says Seymour, " the land of popes, cardinals, bish-
</p>
<p>ops, priests, monks, and nuns, there is perpetrated such
</p>
<p>an amount of murder that the number of persons killed
</p>
<p>every year in cold blood is greater than the number of
</p>
<p>men that have fallen in some of the most terrific struggles
</p>
<p>on the modern battle fields of Europe." In one of the
</p>
<p>doctrines of Popery there is a direct tendency to this re-
</p>
<p>sult. The Protestant believes in no change after death ;
</p>
<p>the Romanist believes that masses, whether purchased by
</p>
<p>friends or by the murderer, can deliver a soul from pur-
</p>
<p>gatory, and these masses can be purchased at a very cheap
</p>
<p>rate. Mr. Seymour delivered a soul from purgatory, as

<p>he was assured by the authorized priest at Rome, who sold

<p>420 TUB PAPAL COXSPIKACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>him a mass at the cheap rate of two francs. He was
</p>
<p>asked to enter the name of the soul to be delivered in the
</p>
<p>altar book, which he did, and was assured that the soul
</p>
<p>in question was actually delivered from purgatory. This
</p>
<p>was certified by a receipt from the priest, which he pub-
</p>
<p>licly exhibits. The only slip in the case was that Mr.
</p>
<p>Seymour entered his own name in the book, thinking, as
</p>
<p>he said, that, as they had pledged to take him out of pur-
</p>
<p>gatory that day, they would have done better to have been
</p>
<p>sure that they had got him in first.
</p>
<p>Resist with united and irresistible indignation all Ro-
</p>
<p>mish attacks upon the Bible, upon history, upon our public
</p>
<p>schools.
</p>
<p>There are also other important principles to be stated
</p>
<p>concerning the rights of self-defence, conferred by God
</p>
<p>on Protestant communities, against the plots and threats
</p>
<p>of Romanism ; but the full consideration of these we shall
</p>
<p>leave to the coming exigencies of the times and to the
</p>
<p>future developments of the providence of God.
</p>
<p>Finally : confide above all things in the sanctifying
</p>

<p>APPENDIX.
</p>
<p>LETTER TO THE HON. JOSEPH R. CHANDLER.
</p>
<p>DEAR SIR :
</p>
<p>SINCE the preceding investigation and argument were completed
</p>
<p>and issued, I have read with deep interest and close attention
</p>
<p>your speech delivered in the House of Representatives of the
</p>
<p>United States of America on January 10, 1855, in which you promul-
</p>
<p>gate your views of the relations of the Papal power to our national
</p>
<p>and state governments.
</p>
<p>Your acknowledged abilities as a jurist and a civilian, your ele-
</p>
<p>vated position as a member of our national government, the eulo-
</p>
<p>gies passed upon your speech even by some Protestants, and the
</p>
<p>measures adopted to give it universal circulation throughout this
</p>
<p>nation, invest your statements with peculiar interest and impor-
</p>
<p>tance.
</p>
<p>You deny the power of the pope to depose kings and other rulers,
</p>
<p>and to release their subjects from their oaths of allegiance by divine
</p>
<p>right ; you declare that, although the popes have exercised this
</p>
<p>power, as you freely admit, yet they have never claimed to exercise
</p>
<p>it by divine right, but have rested their claims solely upon the con-
</p>
<p>cessions, agreements, and constitutions of rulers, and nations ; and
</p>
<p>finally you assert that the pope has unequivocally disclaimed the
</p>
<p>right to exercise the power in question.
</p>
<p>To sustain your positions, you present the testimony of American
</p>
<p>bishops, of foreign universities, and finally of Pope Pius VI., the
</p>
<p>essence of which may be found on pp. 36 41, and 126 of this work.
</p>
<p>I regret that I am forbidden to concede the validity of your evi-
</p>
<p>dence or the truth of your positions by the positive testimony of
</p>
<p>Pius VI., to whom you appeal, and of other popes, including the

</p>
<p>present reigning pontiff. Their testimony is in direct conflict with
</p>
<p>422 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>that of yourself, of the American bishops, of the foreign universi-
</p>
<p>ties, and even of Pius VI. himself ; so that I cannot avoid the fol-
</p>
<p>lowing painful conclusions : .
</p>
<p>First, that the alleged disclaimer of Pius VI., which you quote, is
</p>
<p>worthy of no confidence whatever, but is demonstrably a specimen
</p>
<p>of that pious fraud to which, in all important emergencies, the
</p>
<p>popes have so often resorted.
</p>
<p>Second, that the popes have claimed, and do still claim, the
</p>
<p>power of deposing kings and rulers, and of releasing subjects from
</p>
<p>oaths of allegiance by divine right, and not on the ground of con-
</p>
<p>cession by rulers and nations.
</p>
<p>Third, that these claims of the pope are sustained by the most
</p>
<p>weighty authorities of the Papal church, including popes, councils,
</p>
<p>and standard divines, and that your disclaimers, and those alleged
</p>
<p>by you, have no legitimate weight or authority in the decision of
</p>
<p>this question.
</p>
<p>Allow me, before proceeding to the proof of the first of these po-
</p>
<p>sitions, to present a brief illustration of the nature of the pious
</p>
<p>fraud alleged, as adapted greatly to facilitate the present investiga-
</p>
<p>tion, and to invest it with augmented interest.
</p>
<p>Let it be supposed, then, that after the delivery of your disclaim-
</p>
<p>ers and protestations, and those of your bishops, in our national
</p>
<p>councils, and after they had produced the effect designed in favor
</p>
<p>of your church, it should be discovered that you and they had sub-
</p>
<p>sequently prepared and signed, in Italy, a solemn document, in
</p>
<p>which you had repudiated, reprobated, and condemned the very
</p>
<p>positions you had advocated before this nation, declaring them to
</p>
<p>be false, rash, scandalous, and extremely injurious to the holy see,
</p>
<p>and that you had justified your deception and treachery on the
</p>
<p>ground that they were best adapted to promote the interests of your
</p>
<p>church, and therefore laudable and right let this be supposed,
</p>
<p>and you will have a clear idea of what I mean by a pious fraud.
</p>
<p>Upon you, sir, I charge no such fraud. I do not believe that you
</p>
<p>have so far neutralized the salutary influences of your early educa-
</p>

</p>
<p>tion as not to regard it with just abhorrence. But upon the pope I
</p>
<p>do charge such a fraud in the documents which you have presented
</p>
<p>in his behalf in our national councils. I am willing to assume
</p>
<p>that you presented them in innocence, believing them to contain
</p>
<p>the real opinions of the pope, and that you did not mean to
</p>
<p>TO THE HON. JOSEPH R. CHAXDLER. 423
</p>
<p>delude this nation by ignoring other fundamental documents in
</p>
<p>the case, the presentation of which, by exposing the fraud, would
</p>
<p>have dissipated the delusion created by your speech.
</p>
<p>But I do affirm that Pope Pius VI., after allowing the docu-
</p>
<p>ments which you have quoted to pass as an expression of his opin-
</p>
<p>ions, and to produce their full effect in favor of his church throughout
</p>
<p>the British empire, did in Italy, in a most solemn and authentic
</p>
<p>document, under his own name, repudiate and condemn, as false,
</p>
<p>rash, and scandalous, and extremely injurious to the holy see, the
</p>
<p>doctrine of those very documents, and claim a divine right to depose
</p>
<p>kings and rulers, and to release subjects from their oaths of alle-
</p>
<p>giance. I affirm, moreover, that his successor, Pius VII., not only
</p>
<p>confirmed this document, but distinctly and formally claimed the
</p>
<p>divine right in question, and that it is at this very day claimed by
</p>
<p>Pius IX. in a formal brief issued in the year 1851.
</p>
<p>The proof of these statements is simple and direct. It is this :
</p>
<p>By the bull " auctorem fidei," they utterly condemn the doctrine of the
</p>
<p>Gallican declaration of 1682. Of the nature and importance of this
</p>
<p>declaration you are well aware. In it the clergy of France, under
</p>
<p>the lead of the eminent prelate Bossuet, assumed the very ground
</p>
<p>which you now occupy that the pope has not a divine right to
</p>
<p>depose kings and rulers, and to release their subjects from their
</p>
<p>oaths of allegiance. Upon this declaration of the French clergy it
</p>
<p>was that Charles Butler and the Romanists of England planted
</p>
<p>themselves. No declaration was ever more conspicuous in the his-
</p>
<p>tory of that church. Charles Butler repeatedly assured the people
</p>
<p>of Great Britain, at the time of the great contest, as you now assure
</p>
<p>us. that the whole Roman Catholic world had at last come over to
</p>
<p>that ground. On this basis the universities whose opinions you
</p>
<p>quote, planted themselves. It was by assuming this position, as
</p>
<p>you concede, that they quieted the fears of the peopla of England,
</p>
<p>and gained the political power which they now enjoy. All this
</p>
<p>was well known to Pius VI., and he aided in producing the preva-
</p>
<p>lent conviction by allowing his cardinals to issue, as in his name,
</p>

</p>
<p>and with his approval, the document which you have quoted : and
</p>
<p>yet you will observe that he does not speak in it in person, nor does
</p>
<p>he sign it with the fisherman's ring, nor in any other way does he
</p>
<p>authenticate it as a bull ; nor does he in any formal and official
</p>
<p>way authenticate the oath which you quote. He simply allows his
</p>
<p>cardinals to say that he approves these documents.
</p>
<p>424 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>Not so is it when, in Italy, he condemns the declaration of the
</p>
<p>French clergy and its advocates and defenders. This he does in
</p>
<p>his own name, in a formal bull, officially authenticated.
</p>
<p>I need not say to you that the four articles of this declaration
</p>
<p>were expressly designed to resist the Papal claims of omnipotence
</p>
<p>in church and state. By them he was denied to be infallible in his
</p>
<p>decisions, and superior to general councils and the established
</p>
<p>canons of the church.
</p>
<p>But with special prominence and fulness was his temporal power
</p>
<p>over kings and rulers denied in the first article, which I will present
</p>
<p>in full, in order that the pope's condemnation of it may be seen as
</p>
<p>in the light of the noonday sun.
</p>
<p>" We declare that power over spiritual things, and such as pertain
</p>
<p>to eternal salvation, but NOT over civil and temporal things, was
</p>
<p>conferred by God on the blessed Peter and his successors, in ac-
</p>
<p>cordance with the divine declaration, ' My kingdom is not of this
</p>
<p>world.' John xviii. 36. And again, ' Render, therefore, to Ccesar the
</p>
<p>things that are Casar's and to God the things that are God's.' Upon
</p>
<p>this basis is founded the apostolic declaration, ' Let every soul be
</p>
<p>subject to the higher powers ; for there is no power but of God ; the
</p>
<p>powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever, therefore, resistetk
</p>
<p>the power, resisteth the ordinance of God.' Therefore kings and
</p>
<p>rulers in temporal things are not subjected by the ordinance of God
</p>
<p>to any ecclesiastical power; nor can they, by the authority of the
</p>
<p>keys of the church, be deposed either by direct or indirect power ;
</p>
<p>nor can their subjects be exempted from the duty of fidelity and
</p>
<p>obedience, nor be released from their oath of allegiance. We de-
</p>
<p>clare that this doctrine, which is essential to the public tranquillity,
</p>
<p>and equally advantageous both to church and state, ought by all
</p>
<p>means to be maintained, as in accordance with the word of God,
</p>
<p>the traditions of the fathers, and the example of the saints."
</p>
<p>Such is the famous declaration of the French clergy in 1682. Is
</p>
<p>not this the precise ground assumed by you in your speech ? Was
</p>
<p>it not the professed ground of the English Roman Catholics, led

<p>on by Charles Butler? Are not these the very disclaimers which
</p>
<p>you ascribe to Pope Pius VI. ? Yet this is the very declaration
</p>
<p>which that pope condemned and repudiated as scandalous and ex-
</p>
<p>tremely injurious to the holy see.
</p>
<p>Yet this condemnation was not made openly in England, but
</p>
<p>TO THE HON. JOSEPH B. CHANDLER. 425
</p>
<p>covertly in Italy, so as not to arouse the public mind. It was
</p>
<p>effected on the following occasion. In a council held in Pistoia in
</p>
<p>1786, by the celebrated prelate Scipio Ricci, the reformer of the
</p>
<p>notorious and scandalous immoralities of monks and nuns, to cor-
</p>
<p>rect various abuses, the prelates adopted and eulogized the declara-
</p>
<p>tion of 1682, in order to sustain the Duke of Tuscany, their patron
</p>
<p>and defender, against the pope, who manifested a deadly hostility
</p>
<p>against these reforms. For eight years Pius VI. repressed his feel-
</p>
<p>ings against this declaration. Indeed, in the year 1791, he allowed
</p>
<p>it to be said in England that he approved its doctrines, as we have
</p>
<p>seen. Three years after, however, he adopted the following mode
</p>
<p>of condemning them. He issued a long dogmatic bull, in which
</p>
<p>he condemned eighty-five propositions of the council of Pistoia,
</p>
<p>This bull is known as the bull " auctorem fidei." In the rnidst of
</p>
<p>this immense Latin dogmatic swamp, which he supposed few Eng-
</p>
<p>lishmen would ever undertake to penetrate, he saw fit to locate his
</p>
<p>condemnation of the declaration of the French clergy. The emi-
</p>
<p>nent French Roman Catholic civilian Daunou has, nevertheless;
</p>
<p>brought it forth to the light, and I now submit it to you for your
</p>
<p>careful consideration. Thus speaks Pius VI. :
</p>
<p>" We must not pass in silence the famous and fraudulent rash-
</p>
<p>ness of the synod of Pistoia, which has dared not only to speak
</p>
<p>with eulogy of the declaration of the French clergy in 1682, loig
</p>
<p>since censured by the holy see, but also undertaken to invest it with
</p>
<p>greater authority by introducing it into a decree concerning the
</p>
<p>faith, openly adopting the articles it contains, and sealing, by a
</p>
<p>public and solemn profession of these articles, the principles scat-
</p>
<p>tered through this same decree ; whence it follows, first, that we
</p>
<p>have grounds to form against the said synod complaints much more
</p>
<p>serious than those of our predecessors against the assembly of 1682 ;
</p>
<p>and we may add that this synod outrages also the church of France
</p>
<p>when it deems it worthy of being invoked as the patrcn of the
</p>
<p>errors with which this decree is infected.
</p>
<p>" In consequence, our venerable predecessors, Innocent XL, by

<p>his brief of llth of April, 1682, and after him, more formally still,
</p>
<p>Alexander VIII., by the bull 'inter multiplices,' dated the 4th of Au-
</p>
<p>gust, 1690, having, in fulfilment of their apostolic duties, disowned,
</p>
<p>abrogated, and declared null and without effect the said acts of the
</p>
<p>assembly of the clergy of France, the pastoral solicitude exacts of
</p>
<p>36*
</p>
<p>426 THE PAPAL CONSPIEACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>us, with much stronger reasons, that the adoption which has been
</p>
<p>recently made of these acts in the council of Pistoia be by us con-
</p>
<p>demned and reprobated as rash, as scandalous, and, after the de-
</p>
<p>crees which have emanated from our predecessors, as extremely
</p>
<p>injurious to the holy see ; and accordingly we reprobate and con-
</p>
<p>demn it by our present decree, and we ordain it to be held as rep-
</p>
<p>robate and condemned."
</p>
<p>Here, then, is disclosed, in all its stupendous magnitude, the
</p>
<p>alleged Papal fraud. In England, where the Romish church was
</p>
<p>weak and had an end to gain, Pius VI., with the assumed indigna-
</p>
<p>tion of injured innocence, has the audacity to declare that the see
</p>
<p>of Rome never claimed the power to depose kings and rulers, and
</p>
<p>to release subjects from their oaths, and that those who affirm it are
</p>
<p>heretical slanderers. Universities say amen, and bishops seal the
</p>
<p>protestation by an oath.
</p>
<p>Yet the same Pius VI., in Italy, in 1794, by a solemn bull, repro-
</p>
<p>bates and condemns THE DENIAL that the pope has these very
</p>
<p>powers, as false, scandalous, and extremely injurious to the holy
</p>
<p>see.
</p>
<p>And let it never be forgotten that this bull of Pius VI. does but
</p>
<p>confirm the decrees of his predecessors, and has been sanctioned
</p>
<p>by all his successors, and is now the supreme law of the see of
</p>
<p>Rome. So, then, not only you, but all the bishops of this country,
</p>
<p>if you may be trusted, are involved in the condemnation of this bull.
</p>
<p>It may, I am aware, be alleged in behalf of the bishops that they
</p>
<p>have also sanctioned the opposite doctrine, the true Papal doctrine,
</p>
<p>as promulgated by Mr. Brownson in his Review, with the special
</p>
<p>approval of Pius IX. There is the more reason for this allegation
</p>
<p>since that gentleman assures us that he publishes nothing without
</p>
<p>the sanction of his bishop, and since the leading bishops in this
</p>
<p>nation, if not all of them, have indorsed and recommended his
</p>
<p>work. This magnanimous course will, I presume, satisfy Pius IX
</p>
<p>that at heart they are faithful to him, and he will allow them, as
</p>
<p>well as yourself, to continue to defend, in his name and in that of

<p>Pius VI., those doctrines which both he and his illustrious prede-
</p>
<p>cessor abhor and have utterly condemned and reprobated. Why
</p>
<p>should not the pope pursue the same course to delude the simple-
</p>
<p>hearted and credulous Americans which his predecessors pursued
</p>
<p>with such success in deluding the English ? for the same course of
</p>
<p>TO THE HOX. JOSEPH R. CHANDLER. 427
</p>
<p>fraud was assiduously pursued by Pius VII., and especially after
</p>
<p>the concordat by which the Romish church was reestablished in
</p>
<p>France under the auspices of Napoleon, subsequent to its destruc-
</p>
<p>tion in the revolution. This treacherous pontiff allowed in England
</p>
<p>the use made of the fraudulent document of Pius VI., on which
</p>
<p>you rely ; he left uncensured the protestations of Charles Butler,
</p>
<p>that the whole Romish world stood on the ground of the decla-
</p>
<p>ration of the French clergy in 1682 ; he allowed his bishops to
</p>
<p>take the oath quoted by you, framed in accordance with those
</p>
<p>doctrines, whilst at the same time he was using all his influence
</p>
<p>and energies for the destruction of that same hated Gallican decla-
</p>
<p>ration.
</p>
<p>That eminent Roman Catholic civilian and historian Daunou
</p>
<p>says of him, that " he particularly solicited [from the French gov-
</p>
<p>ernment] the retraction of the maxims proclaimed by the clergy of
</p>
<p>France in 1682. In order to obtain this point he was provided with
</p>
<p>the letter written by Louis XIV. in 1693 to Innocent XII., [in which,
</p>
<p>in his old age, and under the terrors of the pope and of his con-
</p>
<p>fessors, he abandoned the defence of the hated declaration of his
</p>
<p>clergy,] and he seemed not to doubt at all of success. He hoped
</p>
<p>that in reentering Rome he could proclaim himself the legislator of
</p>
<p>the Gallican church, the only and infallible oracle of the church
</p>
<p>universal, the superior of councils, and the sovereign of kings ; foi
</p>
<p>such were the titles which the declaration of 1682 denied him."
</p>
<p>Not succeeding with the French government, he consoled himself
</p>
<p>with a new condemnation of the obnoxious declaration. This, how
</p>
<p>ever, he did not do in an open and manly way, but by introducing
</p>
<p>into a speech delivered in Rome on June 26, 1805, a eulogy on a
</p>
<p>bishop who had adopted and indorsed the condemnation of each of
</p>
<p>the eighty-five propositions of the council of Pistoia, contained in
</p>
<p>the dogmatic bull " auctorem jidei ?) of Pius VI., already men-
</p>
<p>tioned.
</p>
<p>In commenting on this dastardly proceeding, the Roman Catholic
</p>
<p>Daunou remarks, '' Now, it is known that one of the condemnations
</p>

</p>
<p>contained in the bull ' auctorem fidei ' is levelled at the approba-
</p>
<p>tion given by the council of Pistoia to the four articles of the French
</p>
<p>clergy. It was thus that, confirming in all its terror a decree of
</p>
<p>Pius VI., without an explication of its details, Pius VII. proscribed
</p>
<p>at his ease the maxims of this Gallican church, in the bosom of
</p>
<p>428 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>which he had just experienced so honorable a reception. We may
</p>
<p>here remark a specimen of the artifices familiar to the court of
</p>
<p>Rome. ' Ab uno disce omnes.' >J *
</p>
<p>Nor did Pius VII. cease here. In his instructions to his nuncio
</p>
<p>resident at Vienna, first made public from the Papal archives by
</p>
<p>M. Daunou, he claimed as a divine right the power to depose Icings
</p>
<p>and dissolve oaths of allegiance, after the example of Gregory VII.,
</p>
<p>Innocent III., and others. You will find those instructions in the
</p>
<p>address to American citizens prefixed to this work, p. 7. In those
</p>
<p>instructions he declares that the merest tyro in history cannot but
</p>
<p>know that sentences of deposition against heretical princes have
</p>
<p>been pronounced by pontiffs and by councils, and that the subjects
</p>
<p>of an heretical prince are enfranchised from every duty towards
</p>
<p>him, and dispensed from all fealty and homage. He calls these
</p>
<p>the most sacred maxims of just rigor of the church, and declares that
</p>
<p>she still has THE RIGHT of deposing heretics from their principal-
</p>
<p>ities, and of declaring their goods forfeited, although the present
</p>
<p>calamitous circumstances render it inexpedient and impossible to
</p>
<p>reduce these principles to practice.
</p>
<p>Leo XII., Pius VIII., and Gregory XVI. intervene between Pius
</p>
<p>VII. and the present pontiff, Pius IX. Pius VIII. was the special
</p>
<p>friend and confidant of Pius VII. Of course we understand his
</p>
<p>views. Leo XII. and Gregory XVI. distinguished themselves by
</p>
<p>their denunciations against those declarations of rights of conscience,
</p>
<p>and those principles of religious liberty and liberty of the press,
</p>
<p>which lie at the foundation of our national and state constitutions, a
</p>
<p>specimen of which you will find on p. 400 of this work, which
</p>
<p>I recommend to your careful consideration.
</p>
<p>And now, under Pius IX., we meet once more a formal condem-
</p>
<p>nation of the doctrines of your speech in a fresh condemnation of
</p>
<p>the doctrines of the Gallican declaration of 1682. It happened on
</p>
<p>this wise : Francis G. Vigil, Roman Catholic Bishop of Lima, South
</p>
<p>America, published certain dissertations, concerning which he thus
</p>
<p>speaks : " The grand object of my dissertations is to refute the

<p>the spiritual and material swords are in the hands of the church at
</p>
<p>the bidding of St. Peter and his successors; that kings and pontiffs,
</p>
<p>* From one learn the policy of all.
</p>
<p>TO THE HON. JOSEPH E. CHANDLER. 429
</p>
<p>clergy and laity, do not compose two republics, but one only, which
</p>
<p>is the church ; that, as in every body, the members must be united
</p>
<p>and dependent ; and as spiritual things cannot depend on temporal,
</p>
<p>the latter must depend on the former, and be made subservient to
</p>
<p>them." In his second dissertation, among other lofty Papal as-
</p>
<p>sumptions, he exposes the maxim that " he who governs in things
</p>
<p>spiritual governs also in things temporal." Such are the dogmas
</p>
<p>refuted by Bishop Vigil. Thus nobly does he plant himself with
</p>
<p>you on the Gallican declaration of 1682. But what says Pope Pius
</p>
<p>IX. to all this ? Of course, according to you, he says, " Well done,
</p>
<p>good and faithful servant." Nay, rather, by a special brief, bearing
</p>
<p>date June 10, 1851, he anathematizes, condemns, and suppresses
</p>
<p>the book, " as reviving many of the errors of the synod of Pistoia,
</p>
<p>which have been already condemned by the bull of our predecessor,
</p>
<p>Pius VI., of grateful memory." Here, then, from the reigning
</p>
<p>pope, Pius IX., we have a new indorsement of the bull " auctorem
</p>
<p>fidei " of Pius VI., and a new condemnation of the Gallican doc-
</p>
<p>trines of 1682, on which you stand. But this is in South America,
</p>
<p>where Romanism bears sway. Here, as in England, so long as it
</p>
<p>is weak, you and the bishops are allowed to teach, the Gallican
</p>
<p>doctrine, and to confirm it in the name of the pope.
</p>
<p>And now are any words needed to prove that the popes do claim
</p>
<p>the deposing and absolving power by divine right ? Read again
</p>
<p>the Gallican declaration. What is the main point of that docu-
</p>
<p>ment ? Is it not a denial of a DIVINE RIGHT to the power in ques-
</p>
<p>tion? And when the popes anathematize and condemn this denial,
</p>
<p>do they not thereby claim the divine right denied ?
</p>
<p>In reply to your assertion that Gregory VII. appealed to the con-
</p>
<p>stitution and laws of the empire for his authority, and not to divine
</p>
<p>right, I reply that you are not only at war with the established doc-
</p>
<p>trine of the whole line of your own popes, but with all the docu-
</p>
<p>ments of Gregory himself, and that you have quoted no document
</p>
<p>from him to sustain your position. Why did you not quote even
</p>
<p>one ? But your caution is judicious ; there is no document which

</p>
<p>would bear a moment's scrutiny. Your learned prelate and histo-
</p>
<p>rian Bossuet could find none, and affirms that there is none.
</p>
<p>Moreover, he expressly declares that kings and people have never
</p>
<p>recognized the deposing power as lawful. I ask your attention to
</p>
<p>his declaration to this effect on p. 97 of this work. Moreover,
</p>
<p>4:30 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>he drew up the declaration of 1682 against the divine right of the
</p>
<p>popes to the deposing power, because he knew that the popes
</p>
<p>rested their claims on that basis, and on no other. Moreover, your
</p>
<p>champion, Mr. Brownson, whose historical learning I presume you
</p>
<p>will not call in question, is no less at war with you. He declares
</p>
<p>that " ALL HISTORY FAILS to show an instance in which the pope,
</p>
<p>in deposing a temporal sovereign, professes to do it by the authority
</p>
<p>vested in him by the pious belief of the faithful, generally received
</p>
<p>maxims, the opinion of the age, the concesssion of sovereigns, or
</p>
<p>the civil constitution and laws of Catholic states. On the contrary,
</p>
<p>he ALWAYS claims to do it by the authority committed to him as
</p>
<p>the successor of the prince of the apostles, by the authority of Al-
</p>
<p>mighty God, of Jesus Christ, King of kings and Lord of lords, whose
</p>
<p>minister, though unworthy, he asserts that he is, or some such
</p>
<p>formula, which solemnly and expressly sets forth that his authority
</p>
<p>is held by divine right, by virtue of his ministry, and exercised
</p>
<p>SOLELY in his character of vicar of Jesus Christ on earth. To this
</p>
<p>we believe there is NOT A SINGLE EXCEPTION." Such is the testi-
</p>
<p>mony of Mr. Brownson. Till you disprove it by quoting some
</p>
<p>authentic document against it, I shall believe that he is right on
</p>
<p>this point, and that you are in a fundamental error. Allow me also
</p>
<p>to call your attention to his views of the inexpediency, not to say
</p>
<p>folly, of your present position and course on pp. 100, 101 of this
</p>
<p>volume. He there declares that you will not succeed in making
</p>
<p>your disclaimers credible, and that it is the wisest course openly to
</p>
<p>avow the truth.
</p>
<p>Why, then, if he repudiates your declarations, should we be so
</p>
<p>simple as to believe them, and not those of your supreme authori-
</p>
<p>ties? Or would you have us still be deluded by the pious fraud
</p>
<p>of Pius VI., and by the responses of the universities, which were
</p>
<p>in fact condemned by the bull " auctorem jidei," and have been re-
</p>
<p>peatedly condemned by successive popes even to this day ? Shall
</p>
<p>we not be taught by the course 'of events in England ? There
</p>
<p>Charles Butler once took your ground ; but now Dr. Wiseman, the

</p>
<p>main agent of the pope, declares that the canon law is established
</p>
<p>in England, which contains all these atrocious claims of the popes
</p>
<p>in their highest form. He also declares that the morals of Liguori,
</p>
<p>which are the profligate morals of the Jesuits in their perfected
</p>
<p>form, are now sanctioned by the pope, and are of supreme author-
</p>
<p>TO THE HON. JOSEPH B. CHANDLER. 431
</p>
<p>ity. The doctrines of persecution also are openly advocated in
</p>
<p>leading Romish periodicals, (see p. 106 of this work.) and in histo-
</p>
<p>ries prepared for their schools, that a generation may be trained up
</p>
<p>indoctrinated for future deeds of blood.
</p>
<p>Nor can you be ignorant that recently the same doctrines were
</p>
<p>boldly avowed among us, as you may see on the same page,
</p>
<p>although, since the result is proving that the development was pre-
</p>
<p>mature, it seems to be for a time suspended. But in France, Bel-
</p>
<p>gium, Germany, Italy, and elsewhere, the Papal court is exerting
</p>
<p>all its energy to eradicate the Gallican doctrines, and to establish
</p>
<p>the supreme civil as well as spiritual authority of the see of Rome.
</p>
<p>In this movement the leading Romish periodicals, the majority of
</p>
<p>the bishops, the Jesuits, and all the other religious orders rally
</p>
<p>around the pope. At one time the threat was hinted in England
</p>
<p>that the time might come of uniting Ireland and France in an
</p>
<p>armed assault upon the Protestant power of Great Britain.
</p>
<p>What, then, if Charles Butler was sincere ? What if you and
</p>
<p>others are ? Generations die ; but the Papacy, with its immense
</p>
<p>patronage and power of seduction and corruption, still lives, and
</p>
<p>pursues a steady course of policy, the nature of which I have ex-
</p>
<p>posed, and the ultimate aims of which are fast disclosing them-
</p>
<p>selves in England. Even in France the Papacy has at last brought
</p>
<p>the majority of the clergy to repudiate the glorious old Gallican
</p>
<p>declaration, and to rally on the ground of the court of Rome, for
</p>
<p>which the popes have so long and so pertinaciously contended. In.
</p>
<p>South America, too, as we have seen, the Gallican doctrines are
</p>
<p>fiercely anathematized by Pope Pius IX. And can it be possible
</p>
<p>that even you, in view of all these facts, can longer remain simple
</p>
<p>enough to be deluded by the infamous fraud of Pius VI., and by
</p>
<p>the ambiguous responses of the American bishops, who virtually
</p>
<p>sanction the doctrine of Mr. Brownson, whilst you are quoting them
</p>
<p>against it ? Will you, too, be a party to the stupendous pious fraud
</p>
<p>which I have exposed ? I will hot believe it without further evi-
</p>
<p>dence. No ; I shall rather assume that your numerous ecclesias-

<p>tical guides, whom, as you tell us, you have anxiously consulted,
</p>
<p>including pope, cardinals, bishops, and priests, have successfully
</p>
<p>conspired to keep you in ignorance of the true state of the sim-
</p>
<p>plest and most notorious facts, and that, when you put forward your
</p>
<p>theory as that of the whole church, you were not aware that the
</p>
<p>432 THE PAPAL CONSPIRACY EXPOSED.
</p>
<p>leading Papal organs of Europe abominate it, and that Mr. Brown-
</p>
<p>son, in his review of Gosselin, had in this country repudiated it as
</p>
<p>dishonorable to the Papal power, (as you may see on pp. 99, 101 of
</p>
<p>this work,) proving that " the principal Catholic authorities are cer-
</p>
<p>tainly in favor of the divine right," and of course against you. I
</p>
<p>shall assume that you were thus led ignorantly to make statements

<p>which, had you been well informed, you could not have made

<p>without forfeiting your character as a man of honor and integrity.
</p>
<p>Moreover, I shall assume in closing, as in beginning this letter, that
</p>
<p>you will not knowingly prostitute your eminent powers in advocating
</p>
<p>a known and undeniable fraud. Let me, then, hope that, in view of the
</p>
<p>unequivocal evidence laid before you, you will abandon your inde-
</p>
<p>fensible position, and join your Protestant fellow-citizen in repu-
</p>
<p>diating a system the supreme head of which is a sworn defender
</p>
<p>of principles which you renounce and abhor, and a patron of fraud
</p>
<p>BO dishonorable that a noble and ingenuous mind cannot but recoil

<p>from it with indignant abhorrence.

<p>THE BIBLE ITS OWN INTERPRETER:
</p>
<p>A Complete Concordince to the Holy Scriptures ; or, a
</p>
<p>Dictionary and Alphabetical Index to the Bible. By
</p>
<p>ALEXANDER CKUDEN, M. A., by which,
</p>
<p>I. ANT TKIISK in the Bible may be readily found by
</p>
<p>looking for any material word in the verse. To which is
</p>
<p>added,
</p>
<p>II. The significations of the principal -words, by which
</p>
<p>their true meaning in the Scriptures is shown.
</p>
<p>III. An account of Jewish customs and ceremonies, il-
</p>
<p>lustrative of many portions of the Sacred Record.
</p>
<p>IV. A Concordance to the Proper Names of the Bible,
</p>
<p>and their meaning in the original.

<p>V. A Concordance to the Books called Apocrypha.
</p>
<p>To which is added : An original Life of the Author. 1
</p>
<p>vol. royal 8vo, $3 50.
</p>
<p>In its Complete form this work has stood the test of
</p>
<p>more than one hundred and twenty-five years, outliving
</p>
<p>every attempted substitute, such as abridgments of this, or
</p>
<p>other works of similar character made out of it, Bible Anal-
</p>
<p>yses, Manuals, Commentaries, &c. As a help t8 the study
</p>
<p>of the Scriptures, it stands unrivaled among all who are fa-
</p>
<p>miliar with works designed for that purpose. It has been
</p>
<p>justly styled, "The Bible its own Interpreter."
</p>
<p>TESTIMONIALS.
</p>
<p>From the Rev. Professor Goodrich, D.D., of Tale College, New Ila-
</p>
<p>Ten. I have made use of Cruden's Concordance for many years, and
</p>
<p>have always regarded it as a monument of industry, and an indispen-
</p>
<p>sable assistance, in its complete form, to the study of the Word of God.
</p>
<p>From the Rev. M. W. Jacobus, D.D., of the Theological Seminary,
</p>
<p>Pittsburg, Pa. No topical arrangement of passages, however complete
</p>
<p>and useful in its way, can answer (lie same purpose. It is, indeed, a
</p>
<p>Belf-interpreting Bible. Such a verbaT Concordance as Crudc-n has pro-
</p>
<p>duced, is more needful to the liible student than the dictionary to a

<p>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS!
</p>
<p>From the Christian Chronicle (Philadelphia).
</p>
<p>"This edition of tho Concordance is a most superior thins; and, In
</p>
<p>fact, the only one that should bear the name of the distinguished
</p>
<p>author. Every pastor, every student of the Bible, and every family,
</p>
<p>should have this Concordance."
</p>
<p>From the Albany Argw>.
</p>
<p>"Though this work is now considerably more than a century old,
</p>
<p>and has ha 1 competitors in one form or another, it retains an un-
</p>
<p>questionable supremacy in this department of literature to the present
</p>
<p>hour. It has been repeatedly abridged; but no abridgment has ever
</p>
<p>approached the original."
</p>
<p>From the Christian Secretary (Hartford).
</p>
<p>"Every Bible-student, Sabbath-school, and Bible-class teacher, will
</p>
<p>find it to his advantage to purchase this complete edition in preference
</p>
<p>to any of the abridged ones. Beyond all question it is the best index
</p>
<p>to the Bible ever published."

<p>From the Evening Post.
</p>
<p>"It has pretty much superseded every other similar work with
</p>
<p>which it has been brought into compel! iio'n."
</p>
<p>From the Religious Herald (Hartford).
</p>
<p>"A partial imperfect Concordance is little better than none. There
</p>
<p>is but one complete Concordance of ihe Bible, and that is CllL'DEN'S,
</p>
<p>the work which is the subject of this notice."

</p>
<p>From the Christian Mirror (Portland.)

<p>From the Rev. Bishop Janes, D.D., (Methodist Episcopal Church,)
</p>
<p>New York City. No book has aided tne more in the study of God's
</p>
<p>Word enabling me to compare Scripture with Scripture, and interpret
</p>
<p>Scripture by Scripture. I believe Its usefulness both to laymen and
</p>
<p>ministers can hardly be overrated.
</p>
<p>From the Rev. .T. B. Condit, D.D., of Lane Theological Seminary,
</p>
<p>Cincinnati, Ohio. I have used it more than twenty years, with a grow-
</p>
<p>ing estimate of its value. In its complete form, as published by Mr.
</p>
<p>Dodd, I would earnestly commend it as the book that should find a
</p>
<p>place in every family by the side of the Bible.
</p>
<p>From the Rev. I. S. Spencer, D.D., (Presbyterian,) Brooklyn, N. T.
</p>
<p>Crnden's Concordance is, in my opinion, altogether superior to any
</p>
<p>other work of the kind. I do not believe that any Compendium, Ar-
</p>
<p>rangement, or Analysis of the Sacred Scriptures "that has ever been
</p>
<p>published, is so well calculated as this to be of assistance to students of
</p>
<p>the WoidofGod.
</p>
<p>From the Rt. Rev. Bishop Mcllvaine, D.D., ("Episcopal,) Ohio. No
</p>
<p>English Concordance can take its place or do without it It is equally
</p>
<p>precious to the minister of the Word and the earnest reader of the
</p>
<p>Scriptures, or any sort or condition of men.
</p>
<p>From the Rev. Albert Barnes, (Presbyterian,) Philadelphia. I have
</p>
<p>long been in the habit of consulting the work to which you refer, and
</p>
<p>deem it of Inestimable value, and do not believe that it Is superseded,
</p>
<p>or Is likely to be, by any other similar work.
</p>
<p>From the Rev. H. Humphrey, D.D., late President of Amhert Col-
</p>
<p>lege, Mass. I have found it an'invaluable help in "comparing Scrip-
</p>
<p>ture with Scripture."
</p>
<p>From the Rev. Samuel H. Cox, D.D., (Presbyterian,) late of Brooklyn,

</p>
<p>consider as Incomparable and indispensable.
</p>

<p>We leave this book with reluctance. It has all the interest of War-

<p>We have rarely read a book of a religiously didactic character that

<p>The pictures are true to life, and are sketched with such graphic

<p>SERMONS OF THE REV. I. S. SPENCER, D.D.
</p>
<p>Author of " A Pastor's Sketches."
</p>
<p>With a Sketch of his Life. By Rev. J. M. Sherwood.

<p>2 vols. 12mo. With fine portrait.
</p>
<p>OPINIONS OF THl PEESS I
</p>
<p>Prom, the Puritan Recorder.
</p>
<p>"The Trifle circulation which his two volumes of Sketches have
</p>
<p>gained will render these two posthumous volumes of discourses the
</p>
<p>more universally welcome; and we can assure those who have read
</p>
<p>the former, no matter with how much delight, that they will be in no
</p>
<p>danger of disappointment in reading the latter."
</p>
<p>From the New York Independent.
</p>
<p>" As a whole they are fine specimens of the clear, simple, earnest,
</p>
<p>faithful preaching of the Gospel. They are good sermons for the
</p>
<p>family. The memoir is an interesting sketch of a life of industry,
</p>
<p>diligence and devotion."
</p>
<p>from the Daily Courant (Hartford).
</p>
<p>"They are rich in thought, clear, discriminating, and sound in doc-
</p>
<p>trine, and withal remarkable for sim; licity of style and directness of
</p>
<p>address. The sketch of Dr. Spencer's Life as drawn by Mr. Sherwood
</p>
<p>is Just, and presents him as an admirable example of pastoral fidelity
</p>
<p>and great success in ' his work.' "
</p>
<p>From the Journal of Commerce.
</p>
<p>" A more valuable collection it would be difficult to find. The mere
</p>
<p>titles are impressive, embracing all the great fundamental truths of the
</p>
<p>Gospel. Most cordially do we commend these sermons to the atten-
</p>
<p>tion of the Christian public."
</p>
<p>From the New York Observer.
</p>
<p>"They are fall of the strong, good sense, the powerful logic, and the
</p>
<p>pointed appeal, which made his preaching so effective."
</p>
<p>From the New York Evangelist.
</p>
<p>"They are very striking, original, clear and impressive efforts.
</p>
<p>There is not an ordinary sermon in the volumes ; while some of them
</p>
<p>evince consummate ability. They are instinct with life and power.

<p>RECOMMENDATIONS FROM ECCLESIASTICAL BODIES, THE PUBLIC PRES8
</p>
<p>4C. AC.
</p>
<p>Prom the Presbytery of Geneva.
</p>
<p>Resolved "That we recommend to onr churches the forming of
</p>
<p>classes for the study of the Westminster Shorter Catechism, and the
</p>
<p>use of the recent work prepared by the Rev. J. K. Boyd, explanatory
</p>
<p>and illustrative of that admirable compend of divine truth.
</p>
<p>" Passed at session of Geneva Presbytery at Waterloo, Feb. 7th,
</p>
<p>1855."
</p>
<p>from the Richmond Watchman and Observer.
</p>
<p>" Believing, as we do, that the Shorter Catechism is one of the most
</p>
<p>complete products of uninspired intellect, we hail with pleasure every
</p>
<p>aid to its right comprehension. The one before us we regard aa the
</p>
<p>very best we have seen. It presents first an analysis, Ac
</p>
<p>There is thus furnished to the parent or teacher a complete apparatus
</p>
<p>for explaining this wonderful condensation of Scriptural truth."
</p>
<p>From the Princeton Review.
</p>
<p>After quoting the title-page, the notice proceeds :
</p>
<p>"This descriptive title gives a just idea of the author's somewhat
</p>
<p>novel plan, which appears to have been carried into execution with
</p>
<p>commendable diligence and good success."
</p>
<p>From the Puritan Recorder.
</p>
<p>" This was a happy conception. While it relieves the Catechism of
</p>
<p>Its exclusively didactic character, thus rendering it more attractive to
</p>
<p>the young, its felicitous illustrations are well fitted to impress the truth
</p>
<p>more deeply upon persons of every age and character."
</p>
<p>From the New York Evangelist.
</p>

</p>
<p>elucidatory notes. The author has given first an analysis of the Cate-
</p>
<p>chism, &c The light thrown by these various exercises
</p>
<p>upon the text is very great We do not know of any work so full of
</p>
<p>suggestion, in reference to the venerable Catechism, as this; and as a
</p>
<p>book for Bible-classes and the family, recalling that inimitable old
</p>
<p>symbol, we wish we could commend it with power enough to bring
</p>
<p>it into universal use."
</p>
<p>From the Independent.
</p>
<p>"We like the plan of this Commentary on the Catechism. On the
</p>
<p>whole we think it the best help to the parent, the teacher and the
</p>
<p>pastor, In the use of this venerable formulary."
</p>
<p>From the Philadelphia Christian Observer.
</p>
<p>" A valuable and interesting manual for the Bible-class and family."
</p>
<p>Books Published and for Sale by M. W. Dodd.
</p>
<p>from the Presbyterian Magazine.
</p>
<p>" Mr. Boyd's work on the Shorter Catechism seems well adapted to
</p>
<p>take with the young. So far as we have examined it, the strictures
</p>
<p>and inferences are evangelical and judicious; and we hope that Pres-
</p>
<p>byterians will appreciate this effort to promote the study of their
</p>
<p>standards."
</p>
<p>From the New York Baptist Register.
</p>
<p>"The book forms a brief but suggestive system of theology, valua-
</p>
<p>ble both to the ministry and laity," and in the family circle."
</p>
<p>From the Newark Daily Advertiser.
</p>
<p>" This little book of Mr. Boyd's is admirably adapted to interest the
</p>
<p>young in the study of the Catechism, to convey its lessons clearly to
</p>
<p>their minds, and enforce them on their hearts. We consider it a valua-
</p>
<p>ble aid to teachers of Sabbath-schools and Bible classes, and to par-
</p>
<p>ents in conducting family instruction."
</p>
<p>From the Christian Mirror.
</p>
<p>"Mr. Boyd's Commentary is exceedingly well planned and exe-
</p>
<p>cuted ; and we think it will prove widely acceptable."
</p>
<p>From the New York Observer.
</p>
<p>" "We hope that this volume, evidently prepared with much care,
</p>
<p>and giving an analytical view of that monumental compend of di-
</p>
<p>vinity, 'The Shorter Catechism,' mav be an encouragement to its more
</p>
<p>diligent study. It is designed for Bible-classes and family instruction,
</p>
<p>and is very largely provided with proof upon the various doctrines
</p>
<p>exhibited, and with illustrative extracts, which will make the study
</p>
<p>more interesting to the young."
</p>
<p>From the Boston Traveller.
</p>
<p>"This is a most valuable little book, filled with the most important
</p>
<p>Instruction, and enlivened by numerous pertinent anecdotes, illus-
</p>
<p>trative of t,he doctrines taught."
</p>
<p>From the Philadelphia Christian Chronicle.

<p>meet with this edition."
